<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast opened with a discussion about a planned rat-eating contest, detailing the logistics with callers and a French chef who described the graphic process of preparing the rats: killing, skinning, and gutting them.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, expressed increasing queasiness and took bets on who would vomit first. A Channel 2 news crew was filming, and comedian Brian Regan was scheduled to appear later.  The rat preparation involved multiple chefs, one of whom expressed significant disgust.  Wine pairings and dessert options were even considered.  Unexpectedly, Sarah Jessica Parker called, angrily reacting to earlier on-air criticism of her MTV Movie Awards hosting. A heated exchange followed, with Parker expressing hurt feelings before the hosts apologized, and a tentative agreement to meet was reached.  Listener calls followed, many mocking Opie and Anthony's reaction.  Discussion then returned to the rat-eating contest and the fallout from Parker's call. The death of a regular caller, "Stockbroker Dave," was also mentioned.

The show continued with a commercial for Shrewsbury Bicycles' ferry shuttle service. The conversation then shifted back to Sarah Jessica Parker's angry call, followed by a detailed account of the rat-eating contest preparations.  Two chefs, one French and meticulous, the other nicknamed "Jeffrey Dahmer" for his enthusiastic, unsettling approach to killing the rats, prepared the unusually large rodents.  A wine expert offered pairings. Brian Regan, clearly bewildered, was a guest in the studio, his appearances interspersed with rat preparations and discussions of his comedy act.  A listener named "Spaz" shared his theory about the sun being a pressurized self-implosion of a flaming rock.  The show then gave away three Razor Rollerboard scooters to callers.  The segment concluded with more descriptions of the rat-killing and cooking process, highlighting the "psycho chef's" enthusiasm and further banter with Brian Regan, who remarkably remained tolerant of the bizarre situation.  Future appearances by strippers were also mentioned.


Six listeners were then challenged to eat the prepared rats. One rat was prepared by the French chef, the other by "Jeffrey Dahmer," with graphic descriptions of their methods provided.  Brian Regan, horrified by the rat preparation, left for another engagement. The show documented the visceral reactions of hosts, guests, and listeners, including multiple instances of vomiting and disgust. Participants described the taste as chicken or beef, but many experienced nausea, with one immediately vomiting after eating "Jeffrey Dahmer's" rat.  Someone attempted to deliver a plate of the cooked rat to the Don and Mike radio show.  The segment focused heavily on the smell of cooking rat and the disturbing nature of the event.


The rat-eating contest continued, with April from Long Island and an ex-Marine among the participants.  The French chef's preparation was generally preferred.  One participant vomited after eating the "Jeffrey Dahmer" dish.  Sarah Jessica Parker's earlier critical call was again referenced. Following the rat-eating, strippers from the Privilege Gentleman's Club provided entertainment outside the studio. The show ended with promotions for Brian Regan's stand-up shows and the Razor Rollerboard scooter, alongside discussion of listener feedback on the segment and speculation about the show's upcoming syndication.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Powered by Opie and Anthony. Owned by Infinity Broadcasting. This is 1027. WNEW. New New York.  It's Friday! Friday! Friday! Yeah!  Wow.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number. It's Seth, you Friday. What's up, man? 
[00:00:30]  Not much, Anthony. Well, actually, a lot's up, Anthony. What am I saying?  We've got a lot to do today, don't we? Very, very busy day.  A news crew has arrived. Yes.  Three guys have arrived that are going to eat rats today.  We're waiting for the rats. We're waiting for the chefs.  It's going to be a sick show today, man.  Rat eating. Rat eating. Rat eating on the O&H show today. God damn.  We're going to have the big, fat, live rats. 
[00:01:00]  We've got a couple of chefs that are going to prepare them a couple of different ways.  I know there's a lemon herb-type rat dish that one of the chefs want to make and a rat marsala, perhaps.  And the French chef has something special planned.  He is very special. He does.  It's going to be very exciting. It's starting to shape up.  Yeah.  It's going to be a while. I think we officially eat rat around 5 o'clock. 
[00:01:30]  But, I mean, the festivities leading up to that are going to be great because we've got to worry about the live rats that are showing up.  Yeah, because, well, the French chef says that you just have to snap their little necks to cook them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I don't know if I want to be around for that. I don't want to see that.  No, no.  But he seems fine with it. He seems totally fine with it.  He says that's the best way to go about this, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah. You have to get fresh rat. 
[00:02:00]  Fresh rat. You don't want the frozen stuff.  And then you snap their neck.  And then you rip the skin off.  Yeah, you've got to skin it.  Or rip the fur off.  You've got to skin it.  He said, much like a rabbit, your skin, the rat, the skin peels off like a glove.  Yeah.  Yeah. And then you gut the rat without piercing any of the vital organs because that could ruin the delicious rat meat.  Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.  But you're not getting me near any rat meat. 
[00:02:30]  No.  I shan't be eating that.  No.  I was up last night thinking about this saying, God, you know, what if it smells good?  Fuck it.  No, now think of it. It is meat. It is indeed meat.  And done by a chef and some nice sauce, it could actually smell pretty good.  I picked the wrong day to eat sushi is all I have to say.  I was eating sushi in the back office going, man, you know, I ate gross beef.  Maybe I should have went for the burger today.  Yeah.  As long as the rat is done in a marinade, I don't see how it could taste bad. 
[00:03:00]  I'm just worried about the smell when the cooks get going.  That's it. That could get us a little nauseated.  That's what's really tricking me out.  Before any of the sauces are laid down or anything, they must brown it.  Mm-hmm.  And that's going to let off some smoke.  And what you'll be smelling is just burning rat flesh.  Correct.  And the people around here have to eat it.  I mean, you couldn't get me near rat meat. 
[00:03:30]  No, no.  I don't care.  Well, we have the Channel 2 news crew in the studio today filming.  Psycho Mark's trying to get a wow sign on TV.  Psycho Mark, it's in our studio.  You don't have to worry about it.  All right?  I saw a news clip last night.  The guy, I swear, was two stories above the street on top.  I think he was doing the remote from a cherry picker.  Yeah.  He would not get on the street anymore.  No.  Horrified.  Yeah.  So, we have the rats. 
[00:04:00]  They're on their way.  Supposedly.  Yeah.  What's the update, Rick?  I just talked to one of the rat guys.  They're on the train heading in right now.  He's got three rats with him.  Three big, fat rats.  Three nice.  We're looking at five pounders.  No, that's too big, dude.  Yeah?  Five pounds would be like this.  Well, how big are they?  They're like one to two pounds.  One to two pounders.  About that.  About, let's say, from the fingertips to the wrist.  Yeah.  All right.  And you know it takes a lot to ski me out.  Yeah.  I'm like, I mean, my threshold is better than yours. 
[00:04:30]  You've met it?  Yeah, I've met it today.  I'm starting to get, like, just nauseous.  I just don't want to, like, really get into the killing aspect of it.  Once it's done and skinned and just looks like little pieces of beef, I won't have much  of a problem with it, aside from the smell, because you know you'll be smelling rats.  I'm getting queasy, but I'm going to check it out from the beginning to the end.  I don't know, the images of a rat homicide may stick in your head through the whole night. 
[00:05:00]  I don't think you'll be able to sleep.  Little rats.  We're looking forward to it, though.  Rick, how many rat eaters do we have?  Three?  So far, we have two that have showed up.  Who was the other guy, then?  Oh, no, we got, like, six coming down.  Six guys coming down to eat rat.  I hope we have enough rat to go around.  I hope they're not fighting over their rat, their portions of rat.  All right, so we have that going on today.  We got, like, nice six good-sized rats on the way down.  Oh, my God, man.  Damn.  Good.  Plenty of rat. 
[00:05:30]  Are we taking digital pictures for the website and all that?  We got pictures.  We got the spaz cam ready to be activated.  The spaz cam blows, though.  Yeah.  That's primitive technology.  We just got to make sure we get a lot of digital pictures for Steve.  We got pictures, video, and then put it up on the website.  Yeah, an unofficial Steve is coming down the videotape.  Also, we got entertainment on the way, Anthony, for the rat eating.  What do we have?  A very funny man, Brian Regan, one of my favorites.  He's playing Rascals in West Orange tonight.  I'm telling you right now, call.  I hope he's not a member of PETA.  I'm praying. 
[00:06:00]  Why don't we put the rat in PETA bread?  Can we do that?  Yeah, we can do that.  That's kind of an ironic thing, wouldn't you say?  PETA bread.  We can do that.  But, Brian Regan, let me tell you something.  I'm telling you right now, if you have nothing to do tonight or this weekend,  I'm not sure how many shows he's doing,  call Rascals in West Orange right now.  Get your tickets.  I'm going to guarantee you're going to laugh your ass off.  I'm going to guarantee that.  One of the funniest guys out there right now.  I guarantee. 
[00:06:30]  You're going to laugh your ass off.  Side-splitting laughter.  Mm-hmm.  Side-splitting.  Unless you're on heroin like Amy,  and then you'll just be kind of nodding off in the back of the room.  Well, Brian Regan is entertaining everyone.  But he should be here around 4 o'clock,  and just when everything starts heating up with the rat cooking.  We've got another chef on the line, Don.  Don, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Man, I'm a chef.  And there's no way that this is going to taste good.  Why not?  Because it's freaking vermin.  And I don't know where you've got this French chef.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  He must be a Royal Apple chef,  because they're the only freaking people who eat that crap.  Well, we're going to have a competition.  We've got three chefs coming down to prepare the rat, you know?  It's a ready, set, cook rat.  I was at the Illinois Institute of America.  Yeah.  I got trained by some of the great French chefs.  And there's no way in hell that this guy is a real legit chef,  because there's no way he'd cook this stuff.  Well, he'll cook it up like he would any other meat.  Yeah, I realize that.  But come on now.  It's a freaking rat.  It's vermin.  You don't eat that.  How would you prepare a rat, sir?  How would I prepare a rat? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  I wouldn't.  But if I were, I'd probably have to kill it, skin it, brown it.  And then think of a lovely, I don't even know, a lovely sauce to go in it.  What type of presentation would you use for rat?  How would you?  Oh, I'd keep the head definitely and plant that son of a bitch right on the freaking plate.  You might as well.  When you plate it?  I'd plate it with little paws, you know, sticking out the front of the plate.  Yeah, we need a freaking head right in the middle.  Right.  And a little tail garnish. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, we need the chef to have a little creativity and a little sense of humor.  I want to see the rat head on the plate.  Oh, the rat head's got to be on the plate.  You've got to have the tail there, too, for the whole ambiance.  And a little garnish.  Absolutely, guys.  All right, Doc.  All right, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Let's go to Charlie.  Hey, Charlie, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Pretty good.  Listen, I'm taking books.  $75 says Opie tosses his cookies first.  Yeah, you know something?  I know Opie well enough to know that looking at a rat being killed is going to freak you out. 
[00:08:30]  I have a pretty strong threshold, though.  There are things I could check out that you can't.  Listen, I remember an incident with a pinky bite.  Yeah, I was into that.  Yeah, the pinkies were alive.  You were gagging.  We all were.  We all.  You were gagging at the pinky.  But now you.  Yeah.  We had a guy, because, I mean, we have a lot of brand new listeners.  We had a guy for a trip to Hawaii come down here and eat not one, not two, not three,  but I think four or five live pinky mice.  Pinky mice. 
[00:09:00]  And I think that's worse than what's going to go on here today.  Oh, yeah.  Because I think when it's cooked and prepared and a professional chef making a sauce for it,  I think that's better than eating the organs and everything else.  Can I explain something to you, though?  Please, try.  Listen, when they chop the head off of this thing, and this thing is running around bleeding headless, okay?  You can't curse.  You can't curse.  I mean, the curse is cool for the two people hearing it in the studio.  No one hears it on the other side.  The ass is oozing out of them. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  You're going to be curling.  I hope they bring some sharp cutlery.  Okay.  So it's not like a chore to behead this thing.  Who will be the first to puke?  I would like to place a wager.  I will not be the first to puke.  I may puke, but I guarantee I'm not the first one.  First of all, Spaz is going to puke first.  That's my bet.  Okay.  That's my bet.  Spaz is going to puke first, but just from watching him puke, then you're yakking.  Yeah, that happened one other time.  Without a doubt.  When he was drinking his own toilet water. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, when you smell his puke, you're all going.  All right.  Well, thank you, Charlie.  No problem.  Now they're taking bets out there.  And more chefs checking in saying how it should be prepared, and the chef doesn't know what  he's doing because rat meat would be very tough unless it's cooked in a moist heat method,  braising or stewing.  Well, I don't know.  I think he's going to chop it up into strips, brown it.  Who's going to get the drumstick? 
[00:10:30]  The little drumstick.  The cute little rat drumstick.  Yeah.  I hear a lot of people out there, Rick.  What's going on?  Yeah.  Some more people have arrived.  More people have arrived.  They're filling out the paperwork.  They're getting their shirts on.  Nice.  You know, stuff like that.  So things are rolling.  Yeah, it is.  All right, man.  I just, I want the rats and chefs to arrive, please.  Where are the chefs at this point?  I guess the chef should be here within the next 15 to 20 minutes.  Okay.  Plus the wine guy.  Plus, you know.  Yes, we have a wine guy coming down that's going to have a couple of wines that are appropriate with rat. 
[00:11:00]  I think we need some type of dessert.  What kind of dessert would you have with rat?  Maybe cheesecake.  That'd be nice.  Maybe some cheesecake.  Sort of a cheese tie-in thing with the rat.  Yeah.  A sorbet.  I don't know.  What is this, Le Cirque?  What the hell?  Shoot monkey brains.  This guy's whispering disgusting.  John, what's up?  Yeah.  I want to diverge from this, man. 
[00:11:30]  We just captured you going, disgusting.  Everyone heard it.  Cool.  What's up?  Listen, did you see the HBO shock video special they had on last night?  No, I missed it.  Well, they have all these shows from Europe and Australia, like live porn.  Yeah, yeah.  From primetime.  Mm-hmm.  Makes us look like a bunch of prudes in this country.  Okay, terrific.  Bye-bye.  Don't get upset, Opie.  He wasn't, he didn't care what we had to say. 
[00:12:00]  I know.  He wanted to get on the radio and say what he wanted.  Conversations work best when you, if you ask a question that, you know, that the other  person gets to answer, that's kind of fun, you know?  Yeah, that's called a conversation.  Yeah.  It's beyond him.  Yeah.  I don't even know, I didn't even hear what he said.  But I was going to say, and I spent the whole damn night watching that damn Devils game.  Oh, yeah.  Even though I'm not even a Devils fan, but I got hooked in.  Everyone's crying that no one's paying attention to hockey and no one's paying attention to the  Devils. 
[00:12:30]  And come on, it's a tri-state team and they're like on the brink of the Stanley Cup.  I'll tell you, no one cares.  No, I'll tell you one reason why people don't care.  In general, it's June and we're still playing hockey.  Right.  That's one reason.  But I got to tell you, if it was the Rangers or the Islanders.  Oh, there'd be a little, there'd be more.  No, you can't even say the Islanders.  If it was the Rangers, this city would be losing their minds.  Islanders, it would be just like they're handling it with the Devils.  No, I don't think so.  Oh, no, no way.  No way.  If it was the Islanders, there would be a huge hoopla. 
[00:13:00]  No one considers the Devils.  The Devils have a lot of passionate fans.  I know they do and I'm not putting them down, but it's not as if they are the Rangers or  the Islanders as far as New York media picking up on it and people really getting all psyched  for this.  We don't even know because the Islanders haven't even been close in like 15 years.  Drive for five.  But I got hooked into that damn game.  It ended up at like 1.30 in the morning.  Yeah.  Triple OT. 
[00:13:30]  It's insane.  I was watching the MTV Movie Awards.  That blew it off.  Which so-ha-ha-hucked so bad.  So friggin' bad.  They had that Sarah Jessica Parker hosting.  She was horrible.  Ruth Buzzy in a dress.  Her face is looking like Ruth Buzzy.  And she's like parading around.  She kept doing costume changes every like five minutes, you know.  She'd come out in a new dress.  And she's showing off like she's all hot and everything. 
[00:14:00]  But, you know.  She used to be hot.  She used to keep those clothes on.  Exactly.  In L.A.  Story and a few years after that.  But her boobage were getting like all flat.  And like it just wasn't working for me.  The last few years have not been kind to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Not working for me.  And then everybody that was there.  Like all the big celebrities that show up for the MTV Movie Awards.  They're just there to hawk their movies.  That's all.  They had Samuel Jackson talking about Shaft.  He's wearing a Shaft hat.  He's up there Shaft this, Shaft that. 
[00:14:30]  MRF-er.  They had to bleep every other word he said.  And then they had, what's-his-facey there?  It's in the Patriot.  What was that?  Oh, Mel Gibson.  Yeah.  Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson.  I'm on first name basis with him, man.  Mel.  Yeah.  Mel.  Mel.  Mel-y Mel.  They had him because he's got a movie coming out.  It's all a bunch of crap.  Anybody that didn't have a movie coming out wasn't going to do the movie award.  And it was obvious.  They were just there to hawk their movies.  There were no highlights at all? 
[00:15:00]  Nothing.  It was boring as hell.  Boring.  Adam Sandler came out and read a little acceptance thing that was written from the kid from Big  Dad.  Uh-huh.  And that was mildly amusing until it really started going too long.  He always goes too long.  And that was it.  On those award shows.  That was it.  Like, that was the highlight, if you can even call it that.  Who do we have on the line?  Hey.  Hey.  You want to talk about the MTV Video Awards?  Yeah, bro.  Oh, very good.  Now he's listening.  All right.  Very good.  Buddy, dude, this thing sucked. 
[00:15:30]  It was so bad.  I know.  I mean, I thought the South Park skate would save it.  It sucked, too.  Yeah.  It was kind of funny when the gladiator killed Kenny.  And they're like, wait a minute.  Timmy and her.  Yeah.  And then Timmy was in there.  Timmy.  Oh, really?  They really tried to play that Sarah Jessica Parker thing off like it was going to be funny.  She was so bad, and she can't talk, like, naturally.  It was obvious that she's reading from cue cards.  And all the MTV thing was supposed to be, like, the hip alternative to award shows. 
[00:16:00]  And they all act like they're, like it's the Oscars or something.  They're reading off the teleprompters.  They can't carry on a conversation with each other.  It was ridiculous.  The first few years of the MTV Movie Awards were pretty good.  It was cool.  You didn't know it was going to happen.  Now it's structured, and it's like every other award show.  It sucks.  They think it's like, oh, we're hip.  Look, the presenters come down on a slide from the back of the thing.  Wow. 
[00:16:30]  That's cool.  That's different than the Oscars.  And then they step up to the podium and start giving the same long-winded, dopey-ass speeches.  It used to be the anti-award show.  Now it's just another award show.  It's too bad.  It sucks.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks, bro.  Syndication with Spaz Clones Oil.  All right, cool.  He's working on it.  He is working on it.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  Spaz Laboratory.  Brian Regan coming in at four.  He's absolutely hilarious.  He's playing Rascals.  I just got the info.  It was a little wrong before. 
[00:17:00]  Tonight he's playing Rascals in Ocean Township, Anthony.  Two shows.  And tomorrow he'll be playing Rascals in West Orange, okay?  Yeah.  You can call Rascals for ticket info.  All right?  Cool.  All right.  We'll talk to some of the guys that are going to be eating rat in just a bit.  Yeah, Rick?  Our fresh chef has just arrived.  Ah, did we have all the equipment?  He just walked in with a box of equipment.  He wants to talk next, so if you want to talk to him next, he'll be ready.  All right.  Check his equipment.  Make sure he's got the hot plate type thingy and the pans and cutlery. 
[00:17:30]  Actually, he's got gas.  He's got gas?  Yeah.  Got a little gas grill.  Nice.  All right.  I'm going to...  God.  Bring on the rats.  Bring on the rats.  Come on.  We've got to take a quick break.  I'm going to run out there and see how everything's shaping up, and we'll be back to talk to the  French chef next.  A gigantic boom box is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG 7.  Tony and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O&A Show. 
[00:18:00]  212-757-1027.  What a day we've got today, Anthony.  Lots of fun and fine dining.  Fine dining.  That's what you're calling it at this point?  Of course.  It's not just like we're going to be throwing rats on a hibachi.  This is going to be prepared in a way I believe rat has never been prepared before.  Yeah.  If you weren't listening yesterday, in honor of the CBS show Survivor, which we're really  digging, we're going to have some of our listeners eat rat.  I've got to think, if you're eating rat, you're probably very desperate for food, and you don't 
[00:18:30]  care how it's cooked.  You're starving, whatnot.  You're in a third world country.  I don't think rat has ever been prepared in a way that might be palatable.  Yeah, well, the coming preview for Survivor next week, they show the Survivors on this  TV show getting ready to eat rat.  And what, are they just popping on a stick over a fire?  Pretty much, yeah.  They had like a lighter or something and just heated the damn thing up.  I mean, yeah, they don't have like a French chef on the island like we have in the studio 
[00:19:00]  here.  Absolutely.  What's your name, man?  How you doing?  I'm Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Mark called us yesterday, Anthony.  He's the French chef, and he's one of three or four chefs that will be preparing the rat  today.  The rat.  And he's setting up everything outside the studio.  Very professional.  He's got a little gas burner, a nice big frying pan, and various sauces, and some tomato,  lemon.  Croutons and everything.  Croutons, yeah.  He brought in some bread.  Everything.  It's going to be a unique dining experience. 
[00:19:30]  Do you have any ideas that you can tell us?  How are you going to prepare the rat?  I'm going to make scallopinis.  Rat scallopinis.  Scallopinis, yeah.  So, what, you're going to slice it thin?  Slice them very thin.  I'm going to pound them.  So, I'm going to make them very thin.  They're going to cook in two seconds.  You're never going to know what it is.  Yeah, right.  Wow.  I bet you you're going to eat some later on.  I don't think so.  Now, the most treacherous part of this whole thing is going to be getting the rat from  its little moving around live state to being prepared to be cooked. 
[00:20:00]  First of all, you kill him, yes.  Now, how will you take care of the...  I'm going to grab him from his back with a couple of towels so he won't bite my hands.  Right.  And I'm going to put him on the side on my cutting board.  Yeah.  I'm going to take the cleaver.  I'm going to smash his head.  Oh, my God.  Just the neck.  Okay.  If he's still moving, I'll give him another one.  You'll give him another shot.  Yep.  Now, are there any other animals that are commonly used for food that you have to do this to? 
[00:20:30]  Not really.  Oh, yes.  The rabbits, actually.  You've got to hang them upside down from their back legs.  Uh-huh.  You've got to give them the hand shot behind the neck.  Oh, the hand shot behind the neck.  A little karate shot.  Mission Impossible 2.  He always works.  2.  2.  Wow.  Okay, so...  French chefs and ponderers.  Ponderers.  You just made our dead.  Is that Don on the phone?  Where are my rats?  Right, right, right.  There you go.  All right.  And then, now, to get the rat now it's dead, what do you do to it after that? 
[00:21:00]  Well, I usually empty your mouth first.  All right.  You would cut them open and then...  Cut them open where the, you know, the stomach is.  The belly, right.  All the way down to the bottom.  And then...  Then take out all the guts out.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  That's the fun part.  I told you.  It's getting to it finally.  I just got that shiver thing.  I know, I know, I know.  I know, I've had that about five times so far today.  Then with a small knife, I'm going to start to cut their wrists off.  Right.  Just like, you know, the skin comes apart.  Right.  Open them up a little bit. 
[00:21:30]  And then from the back, no, actually from the top to the back, you just pull on it.  You pull the skin down.  It comes off like a glove.  Because they're still warm.  Yeah.  They're still warm, so it comes right off.  Oh, Opie, when they're still warm, the skin comes right off.  If you wait until they get cold, you have a more hard time.  Right.  Then you'll be plucking pieces of skin and fur.  But, yeah, I know.  I've hunted rabbit before.  And when you bag them, you've got to gut them.  And then you make a little cut around the back of the neck.  Exactly.  Hold the head.  And then just pull the skin.  And you've got to cut around the arms and the hands and feet. 
[00:22:00]  And the whole thing comes off like a little rabbit suit.  And I'm starting to flail around like King Gimp.  I can't hear any more details.  I cannot hear any more details.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun.  You see.  All right.  We want you to, like, decorate the plate before these guys eat the rat.  We want maybe the rat head on the plate.  Maybe the tail, you know.  I'm making nice.  A little presentation.  Yeah.  It's all about the presentation.  I'm dining for the restaurant.  What do you think?  Very good.  I'm so excited to see how he's going to prepare this. 
[00:22:30]  It sounds like it's going to be delicious.  Oh, shut up.  You will.  I wouldn't doubt it.  It's an exotic meat prepared by a professional French chef in various sauces that are probably delicious.  I don't care what you put on it.  It's still a New York City subway rat.  What do you think?  Let's not forget that, okay?  They seen that during the war.  Right.  And the Civil War.  The rat was very big.  Do you know what rat tastes like? 
[00:23:00]  No.  Matt, sorry, Matt.  No, Mark.  Mark.  Oh, they wrote down Matt.  And I said Mike, and it's Mark.  That's great.  Here, give me a pen.  No, I never ate it before.  No?  No.  And you also have some frog legs out there.  Yes, I brought some frog legs.  Oh, but you brought some frog legs.  I've had frog legs.  Do some kind of bizarre experiment, my four-assed rat frog-legged creature.  Frog legs isn't that bad.  They're delicious.  They're like chicken.  Exactly.  A little bit.  A lot of people saying the rat will taste like rabbit. 
[00:23:30]  Because they're from the...  I believe it's going to be red meat.  The same type of family.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, any time I've seen a squished rat, it's usually red meat coming out of the open  wounds.  It's not like rat, the other white meat.  It's more like...  It's like steak, you know?  It's more like rat what's for dinner.  You know?  Beef.  All right.  Looks like biff.  All right.  Beef.  I'm very excited.  What kind of spices did you bring?  Did we go over that?  No, actually, I didn't.  I bought some pepper sauce, peppercorn sauce, and some mustard sauce. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And that'll help the flavor of the rat?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Is this place going to stink like rat when this is getting cooked up?  No, actually, it's funny.  You know, like when you see off a steak, you know how to...  It's not going to look like steak.  When you brown...  When he browns it, you just got to brown it, and then you'll smell like...  Then I deglaze it with some cognac, so, you know.  Oh, deglaze it with cognac, Opie.  My mouth is watering.  Yeah, mine is, too, but not for the same reason.  All right, Eddie.  Then I make my sauce with the rest, you know, with the meat inside the pan. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  My boss donated the pan because he doesn't want to have it back.  I would think, yeah, that pan is probably going to just be thrown out.  That would not be smart.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  So it isn't.  Terrific.  All right.  Who's your cooking idol, like Julia Child or something?  Oh, please, none of those people.  I just...  No?  If I could find it, I would be over the head with that.  And then cut her around the wrist and feet and skin her.  Whoa!  Hard to pull the skin over my big hunchback.  I think his mentor is Ziggy. 
[00:25:00]  Hmm.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  You guys, you know that feeling when you feel like you're going to get sick?  Yeah, I've had that feeling.  Oh, my...  I'm keeping track.  I'm up to six already.  My lunch is coming up.  It's so disgusting when he's like, he's going and it's a rat.  Yeah.  It wouldn't bother me if it was a chicken, but just the fact that it's a rat, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Just to give you an update, we've got the guys that are going to eat the rat.  We have one cook.  All we need is one rat to show up from the pet store, and we've got game.  Oh.  Do we have an update on the location of our rats? 
[00:25:30]  En route.  Should be here within minutes.  Okay.  All right.  Well, good luck, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Wine guy downstairs on his way up right now.  All right, we have a wine.  Wait, the rat is downstairs?  No, the wine guy.  Oh, the wine guy.  All right.  We are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the main course.  Yeah.  The rats.  Can't do nothing about that, huh?  No, we're waiting.  They'll be here.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Great.  Yeah, when I was going through China, in southern China, baby rats are actually a delicacy. 
[00:26:00]  They call it sweet scream.  What they do is they take a rat about the size of your thumb, they dip it in a syrup, they crunch  on them live.  Whoa.  I just think it's funny that you guys can watch videos of 90-year-old women having sex,  and this is what disturbs you.  Well, this is definitely disturbing me today, yes.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  Yeesh.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Hey.  Hey.  Who's this?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, these are the fellas that were just trashing me. 
[00:26:30]  Are these the guys?  Are you Sarah Jessica Parker?  I am indeed.  Now, how do you prove that?  How do I prove it?  I don't know.  How does one prove their identity with the throne?  It does sound a lot like you.  I got to say that.  Do you listen to our radio show?  No, I don't.  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on, and I was fortunate.  The timing was absolutely, absolutely beautifully fortuitous for me.  Sarah Jessica, I got to say, your performance on the MTV Movie Awards, fantastic. 
[00:27:00]  I thought you did a great job.  I loved the costume changes, especially the one at the end.  You're such a puss, Ant.  What?  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  You don't have the balls to actually say to me what you said to your maybe limited audience?  Come on, buddy.  Limited audience?  Come on.  We get more people listening to this show than watching that Sex and the City.  Really?  Yeah.  Are you certain of that?  Positive.  I watched the...  What's up?  Hey, guys, listen.  Listen.  I watched the...  Take it easy.  It's all right.  You're absolutely entitled to an opinion. 
[00:27:30]  I just thought it'd be...  I just thought maybe I'd put a human fate to, you know, some trash talk, and I thought  it'd be helpful to you to actually make it less abstract and more of a person.  I thought you were really hot in L.A. Story.  Hello?  That means the world to me.  Thank you.  Thanks.  So what do you guys do?  You're DJs on the air in New York City?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your chat show hosts?  Yeah, that's all we do.  We're not as famous as you or anything.  No.  You know.  But listen...  Hey, you want to come down and eat some rat? 
[00:28:00]  What I wanted to do, what I actually wanted to do, because I actually don't know you guys,  and I don't actually listen to the radio only because I don't have time, not because  I'm an elitist or I think I'm above it.  Why don't you come...  I simply don't listen to the radio.  What I thought I might do, since you've hurt my feelings so terribly, and since I actually  am a person with feelings, and you seem to have an idea about me that I'm sort of hideous  and awful...  Hold on, hold on.  What do I do?  Let me finish, fellas.  What does she want to do?  Let me have mine.  All right.  What do I do?  What I do is I would invite you to the set if you're interested in coming. 
[00:28:30]  We're shooting in New York City, as you know, with our tiny little audience show called  Sex in the City, which is just bigger than ever.  I saw the season premiere, and I enjoyed the whole Staten Island thing you guys did this  past week.  Thank you.  Well, thanks.  That's big of you.  Thank you.  What I do is, if you guys are brave enough, I thought perhaps you might want to come  to the set and pay a visit and actually see that I'm not a deformed, awful-looking person.  Oh, my...  Wait, wait, wait.  And he said it actually, actually, he forced me to toot my own horn, and I will say this. 
[00:29:00]  We didn't take it that far.  I've never been one that had been accused of being stilted in her speaking.  I've made numerous appearances on Letterman for God knows how many years.  Sarah, you seemed a little stiff.  Sarah...  I'd hardly be accused of being a stiff person.  We're just two schmucks on the radio.  Let her finish.  It doesn't matter what we say.  Let her finish.  We have personal taste, that's all.  I think it's a rather daunting experience to be the host of an award show when one has  not made a living nor practiced doing that. 
[00:29:30]  And I think that perhaps if you met me, you might actually discover that you like me.  You might actually be on my side.  You want to come down today?  We're...  No, no, no.  We have some listeners.  I work 18 down today.  I think you have to come here.  I think that's the best you can do as men, is to tod your little feet down to my  set.  Come just at me and say hello.  Oh, look.  Now she made me feel all bad.  I know.  You should.  You should.  You guys take pot sauce and you don't realize we're people.  Man, we've got...  You have to do something.  Would you turn...  Would you say no?  I didn't... 
[00:30:00]  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me...  Whether or not you knew you had to do something.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  We didn't say you were hideous or anything.  Yes, you did.  It's not...  Really?  We just said...  You absolutely, without question, inferred that.  Calling me Ruth Buzzy.  Calling me old.  I thought it was quite flattering when I said you're starting to look like Ruth Buzzy.  You damn people aren't supposed to listen to these goddamn shows.  You really think whoever you are, whichever one you are, you really think that calling  somebody Ruth Buzzy is a flattering comment?  You need to get out more often, my friend.  It's called humor.  We're just trying to have fun.  You think people that heard that comment really go, oh, yeah, she's looking like Ruth Buzzy? 
[00:30:30]  I can't wait to see what you guys look like.  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  I imagine you are, and so you're so lashing out with rage.  That's what it is.  With rage you are.  Come on, boys.  Come over to the set one day.  We're two just, you know, radio talk show hosts.  Don't be scared of me.  Don't be scared of me.  I'm not scared.  You're going to have Matthew punch us in the nose?  Matthew is so above punching you two in the nose.  Wow, we got to you.  Who are we?  You're like a big, famous Oliver Star. 
[00:31:00]  You're just two local shock shots.  These actually are real people with feelings, and they work really hard.  And granted, am I a flawless person?  But no, do I go and fix it and become something else?  I'm not.  That's who I am.  All right, can we play What's in Sarah Jessica Parker's Pants right now?  It's a game we play.  I think it would be a good way to break the ice and make peace.  You take the phone and rub it on your most intimate of areas, and we guess how you're groomed.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes.  Let me ask you a question. 
[00:31:30]  I can't believe we got to.  I'm thinking mobile.  I'm delighted to know.  You just made my day.  Aren't you guys kind of delighted to know that when you actually trash someone, that there's  to actually get a person listening, and they have to be able to cut off?  No, I hate that.  I hate that.  Yeah, we're going to have to reevaluate.  Doesn't it kind of make you feel badly?  We're going to have to reevaluate the entire program now.  It kind of makes you feel like crap, doesn't it?  Honestly, no, it doesn't.  It's so easy to do.  No, Sarah, Sarah, if you'll let us talk, it doesn't change my opinion at all.  I don't care.  We're just trying to have fun and make people laugh.  We're just two local shock jocks.  You're a Hollywood star, and we got it. 
[00:32:00]  I'm not a Hollywood star.  I'm a New Yorker.  I've lived here my whole life.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm a working actress.  That's what I am.  You're not?  I did.  I did.  You put me on the air.  Yeah.  I did that.  You put me on the air, and I'm not saying you're not entitled to the first thing I said.  I just want you to know there's a person.  Are you going to?  There's a person attached.  Are you going to cry?  No.  No, no, no, no.  I'm a grown woman.  She won't cry.  Maybe secretly we think you're really hot, and we're frustrated that we can't get you.  You guys want to come visit me?  Or no?  And we can't have sex with you or something?  We'll come visit you as long.  I'm sorry.  Don't go overboard.  You guys want to come visit?  I'll come visit you as long as you don't get us beat up or anything. 
[00:32:30]  No, I just want you to meet the crew, and I want you to meet everybody that I work with.  Oh, that's going to just be ugly.  And then we'll get all beat up.  That's going to be ugly.  Why not come and be in my environment?  How about we meet in the middle somewhere?  Neutral territory?  Yes.  Like Sweden?  Man, I'm starting to like you all of a sudden.  Like Sweden?  She's feisty.  You're feisty.  I like that.  Well, unattractive women tend to be feisty.  No, Ruth Buzzi never gave me a boner.  You do.  Okay?  Oh, please, fellas. 
[00:33:00]  Don't try to backpedal that much.  No, we're not backpedaling.  You're getting on our good side.  I wanted you to know that there's actually a human being connected when you guys...  I know it's funny, and I know it's charming, and it's amusing to the listeners, and I've  laughed at things in the past, too.  But I just want you to know there's a person.  That's all.  Opie's the mean one.  I'm nice.  I don't know which one's which, and I sort of don't care because you guys sort of did  a tag team thing.  No, you care because you called in.  I do care.  I do care what you have.  So you just heard our voices in the background in between, you know, filming Sex and the 
[00:33:30]  City, and went, oh, my God, they're talking about me?  Where were you when you heard us trashing you?  We're sitting downtown on Chamber Street.  Right.  In the surrogate court building, which means I'm surrounded by authority.  Right.  So anyway, I have to go to the set.  They're calling me to the set.  But I just wanted to...  Can we have all our listeners bring down flowers to apologize or something?  I want you to bring down flowers.  They didn't do anything wrong.  They're just happy listeners.  Trust me.  Yeah, I think...  Right?  Huh?  No, they're on our side.  But I feel the same way. 
[00:34:00]  You feel Jesus.  No, no, no, no.  Someone on line nine is calling us pussies.  Yeah.  Oh, man, you can't win.  Because now we're back.  Listen, thank you.  Thank you for letting me call.  You're men for listening.  I appreciate it.  And I'm dead serious when I say come down to the set and visit.  You don't have to come today.  We're shooting until mid-August.  We're here in New York City.  Could you hold on?  Our producer will just get info.  If you could just give it to somebody on that end, we'll try to figure this out.  I look forward to meeting you.  And I secretly do watch Sex and the City, even though I can't admit it on the radio show.  It's kind of a chick show.  No, it's not, man. 
[00:34:30]  And you are the hottest on the show.  The blonde, I don't like at all.  She was naked in the firehouse this week.  These are the people I work with.  I dig her.  I dig her.  Yeah, but I...  You're trash talking to me.  I'm not going to jump on your side.  No, but I'm just giving my opinions again.  All right, but don't be kidding me.  She was naked through that whole first episode, and I wasn't feeling it.  I was hoping you were going to get naked with that politician, the controller.  I'll never get naked.  I never have, and I never will.  No?  It was pretty close last night on the movie awards.  All right, why don't you get the information so I can go to set and not get fired?  Okay.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye. 
[00:35:00]  There she goes, Sarah Jessica Parker, calling in.  Well, you know, she's got some balls there.  Comes calling up and defending herself.  Man, this show has come a long way.  You know, it used to be safe where we could trash people, and it never gets back to them.  Yeah.  I think our audience is getting too big.  Yeah, we got to leave this city.  If we were in Tallahassee, you know, no one would care.  They go line to Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm like, this is no way it's Sarah Jessica Parker.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[00:35:30]  Yelling at us.  You should have told her that you need some rats.  Opie.  Yeah.  You should be a little nicer next time.  This is a scary point.  I bet you we go down there, and we see her, and we just go, oh, my God, she's knockout gorgeous.  She's so hot.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh.  Wow.  She just made us eat crow, practically.  Screw the rat.  Yeah, I know.  It's so hard to just, because everyone can call up and say, you guys are pussies.  Why don't you, you know, it's one thing to say stuff on the air. 
[00:36:00]  It's another when they call up and call you on it to, like, keep going.  I think we held our own, though.  I didn't write down too much.  No, I totally pussied out.  I've got to be honest with you.  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  I totally pussied out.  I do like it when her hair is down.  When she pulls it back, it's not as sexy.  Yeah.  But we love Sex and the City, right, Ant?  It's one of my favorite shows.  I can't believe she heard us dressing her. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, are there any other celebrities listening today?  We'd love to hear from you, and we'll give you our opinion on you.  Yeah, and then you could rub it in our face.  Right.  God, we're just two dopey, like, local talk show guys, and we got to, like, a Hollywood starlet.  With our stupid opinions, Anthony.  Made it feel bad.  Yeah, see?  And I'll go on record to say Ant and I are nothing to look at.  We know that.  We never sit here on the radio and say, hey, you know, GQ called, and they want us for a photo shoot. 
[00:37:00]  But I'll tell you one thing.  If MTV Movie Awards called and wanted me to host, I wouldn't be strutting around in clothes,  just trying to look all hot, you know.  You just didn't like the MTV Movie Awards, and she was what, the host?  She was the host, yeah.  And I think, and I still said, she came across as a little stiff, I'll be.  Okay.  A little stiff.  Any other celebrities like to call up today?  We'd love to talk to you.  In her defense, she said that she doesn't do that by trade, and she thought it would be an exciting, fun thing to do, 
[00:37:30]  like, in hosting the MTV Movie Awards.  And so she did it.  And who am I to say that she came off as stiff?  I think all next week we dedicate the O&A show to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yes.  It'll be the We Love You Sarah Jessica all week next week.  Okay.  We can do that.  We'll get a sky rider.  We'll put a heart up over Central Park.  We'll get our listeners to send flowers down to the set.  We'll make up some bumpers saying that this week is the Sarah Jessica Parker Club Tribute Week. 
[00:38:00]  Club Fest.  Club Fest Week.  Stockbroker Mike, how are you?  Yeah, this is Stockbroker Mike.  I'm calling to say that Stockbroker Dave was found dead yesterday.  He was found naked in a hotel with a carrot in his butt, asparagus in his mouth, and a Wall Street Journal under his hand.  So you'll be taking over for Stockbroker Mike, Stockbroker Dave?  Yeah, I'd like to offer Sarah Jessica Parker $5,000 if she has some fun with a carrot. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, right.  You think we could get that done?  Dave, I know you want us to call you another name, but it's not happening, man.  It's got to.  You idiot.  It's got to.  I get fired.  I guess that new job's pretty good, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really good.  I'll get fired.  They already told me Stockbroker Dave is dead.  Dude, how brutal was that that Sarah Jessica Parker just called us?  But, Anthony, you are a pussy.  I am such a pussy. 
[00:39:00]  Look, I'm not even going to deny the fact.  I was trying to, you know, keep the coolness of the O&A show, but I was failing miserably, too.  You did okay, Ant.  You backpeddled so goddamn fast.  You know, I've got to grow some friggin' balls.  When I'm confronted by these people.  Didn't Wendy get that in the settlement?  Yeah.  Got my balls.  For the love of God, if I saw her naked, I would lose it anyway.  That's the guy's eyes.  That is so friggin' cool.  She's not that hideous.  No, but you've got to go see her. 
[00:39:30]  You know she's listening right now to see what else we say.  Sarah Jessica Parker, we love you.  And if you want to make $5,000, call Stockbroker Mike.  We love you.  And we're going to be on Channel 2 News tonight because we have people eating rats so you can get a peek of how beautiful we are.  It'll definitely make yourself feel much better, okay?  All right.  Well, Mike, Dave, whoever the hell you are, what's going on?  Are you coming down today?  No, I can't make it.  All right.  I can't make it, but people are going to be eating some rats today? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, we might need some money from you.  What do you need?  Winstockbroker Mike's money.  You've got it, because Dave is dead.  All right, man.  Good luck, boys.  For now on, you're Mike.  Easy.  Mike?  No, Hawk.  Mike?  Hawk.  It's Mike Hawk.  Oh, Mike Hawk?  Hawk.  Hawk.  What are you, Dave?  That's a good one.  What are you, Dave?  Stockbroker Mike Hawk.  Mike?  Right.  Hawk.  Your full name is Michael.  Yes.  Yeah.  Mike Hawk. 
[00:40:30]  See, Anthony, even though you're a pussy, you're a lot smarter than the other one.  I'm such a pussy.  Sarah's listening right now going, no wonder these guys will never make it across the line.  They got third grade humor.  We're not having sex in the city.  I know.  I know.  I know.  How much do these boys need to eat a rat?  I don't know.  Whatever you can come up with.  How about 500 bucks if they eat the head?  A lot of them are doing it for nothing.  Stockbroker Mike.  Call back in a little while when we get everything going, okay?  You got it, O&A.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, boy.  I didn't feel bad, though.  If she's listening, I did.  We're just trying to have fun and have some, I don't know, make people laugh.  How about the rat tongue?  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I heard her voice.  I knew that was her right away.  I felt guilty, man, for laughing at what you guys were saying.  I was like, holy mackerel.  I know.  It's very rare someone calls us out on something, and I'm like, there's no way that Sarah Jessica  Parker will take time out of her busy day. 
[00:41:30]  She just hosted the movie awards, even though they taped that a while ago, but I'm sure she's  doing press, post-press.  Yeah.  She's filming sex in the city.  I'm like, there's no way she has time to call up because two wacky DJs in New York said  something bad about her.  It's like telling your buddies you're with this chick, and all of a sudden, she walks  in a room.  I know.  We just got snagged is what happened.  We got snagged.  I love you guys.  Take care.  Have a great weekend.  Bye.  We were called out, and I, for one, folded.  I folded. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I hate that.  They're not supposed to be real people.  They're just cagged.  Whatever.  Pete.  Yeah, you guys are such pussies.  Yeah.  Ripping over your own tampon strings as you're backpedaling, you two little women.  Hey, I got a good idea.  The next Sex in the City, maybe they can have all the girls bend you guys over and just rape  the hell out of you women.  We'll do it.  We'll be violated with strap-on devices on Sex in the City. 
[00:42:30]  Sex in the City has become one of our favorite shows right behind Survivor.  What a mess.  They're not supposed to call.  I'm like, there's no way a lady's going to, like, imitate Sarah Jessica Parker well.  I could tell by the voice right away.  Chris, what's going on?  How you doing?  Hey.  I think next week's dedication should be called, hey, Sarah Jessica Parker, why the long face?  All right.  Easy.  Hey, where are the rats, man?  Wait, wait, wait.  Rick just had a, did you talk to her or she put you on with someone else? 
[00:43:00]  First, I got an earful from her.  What'd she say to you on the phone after we hung up with her?  She asked if I was proud to be working for you guys.  Oh, you gotta see.  And I had to admit that, no, I wasn't, not at that particular meeting.  Oh, you're a pussy, too.  Look at you.  Hey, I learned from you guys.  Oh, we got off on the wrong foot with Sarah Jessica Parker.  Now we're going to have to make it up to her.  So, yeah, we're going to, I'm going to try and get something set up next week.  And if that goes well, she said she would come in.  Yeah.  I'll be honest, I don't have the balls to go down to the set of Sex and the City and meet 
[00:43:30]  her and confront her.  Oh, have a bunch of hot chicks laughing at us.  Yeah, yeah, that's not emasculating enough.  Because we never claim to be freaking, you know, models or anything.  Oh, no.  And you know Matthew's going to be there.  He's going to try to punch us in the nose because we trashed his woman.  Dude, can we get a couple of, like, GQ model guys to go down there as Opie and Anthony?  Come on.  Come on.  That's perfect.  We'll pay him.  They'll be dressed to the nines and stuff.  Right.  Welcome.  Hello. 
[00:44:00]  I'm Opie.  I'm Anthony.  How are you?  Sorry, Jessica.  And I do want to say, first, Bueller, one of my favorite movies of all time.  I'm going to just start.  Yeah, that was good.  She's an ass like crazy now.  I loved that one.  War Games.  What a movie.  Was she cool by the time you hung up with her?  No, she was still pretty hot on the couch.  Oh.  Oh.  No.  See?  And then I caught an earful from the publicist.  What did the publicist say?  She's like, you know, you guys don't even know her to be talking that way.  I'm like, look, honey. 
[00:44:30]  You're preaching.  Honey.  I go, I didn't say anything.  Well, you might as well have.  And she just gave me an earful.  All right.  So, thanks.  Okay.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Oh, by the way, our first and only female rat eater is here.  All right, cool.  Well, it's getting really busy.  We've got CBS News here.  They're filming the festivities.  I want rat.  You're out cooking, God damn it.  He's got to go.  We've got Brian Regan.  He's in next.  All right.  Let's talk to Brian Regan next.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.

They're back advertising with our show.  Very good.  Yeah.  They gave me a bike last year, and I love it.  I ride it all the goddamn time.  Me too.  No, you don't.  You don't even know where yours is.  Oh, no.  You did get that out of the house, right?  With the computer?  Well, I have a unicycle now. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I had to give the front wheel and half the frame.  No, your bicycle is pretty much a coat rack in your house right now.  Yeah.  That damn thing, which was a state-of-the-art mountain bike.  Okay, too.  Has never hit the road.  No.  It hasn't.  It's in its pristine state.  It's wonderful.

[00:47:30]  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1037-WNEW.  New New York.  All right, Anthony, we got so much going on today on the show.  We just got distracted for the last 20 minutes because we had Sarah Jessica Parker pretty much screaming.  Not screaming, but lambasting us, yeah.  That's cool.  I give her a lot of credit.  We say crap all the time.  We don't realize that the people may be listening.  Yeah, they don't listen. 
[00:48:00]  Also, let's get a rat update real fast before we get Brian Regan in here.  Oh, those mics are...  We already put the Sex and the City little, like, advertisement on our studio door.  Where are the rats?  They're on the way.  I just had a phone call.  The guy's, like, on the subway.  He's getting on the subway.  He should be here in a minute.  Yeah.  I wonder if he's got, like, a little Walkman or something.  Is he monitoring the program? 
[00:48:30]  I have no idea.  Maybe he should call us.  Yeah.  Call up.  We're getting a little worried.  Well, if he's on the subway, he won't be able to see us.  We're still ahead of schedule, though.  Are you okay?  What the hell is that?  What was that?  Our phone's just coughed.  Oh.  All right.  We're still ahead of schedule, though.  We don't want the rat eating to happen until about 5 o'clock.  So, we got the rat eaters.  We got one of the chefs so far.  One of the chefs.  He's prepping stuff right now.  He's prepping.  Some tomatoes and stuff.  All right.  The wine guy is here. 
[00:49:00]  The wine guy.  The wine guy is here.  Very nice.  I saw the chef, the French chef.  He's cutting up the tomatoes into lovely little rosettes.  And he made a wonderful basket out of a lemon that he's going to put the rat head in.  Yeah.  For a little, you know, I guess it's a little ambiance to his dish.  And Channel 2 News left the building.  We got bumped for a story on the West Nile virus.  Yeah.  They were taping.  I think there's an outbreak of the West Nile virus or something. 
[00:49:30]  Remember the giant mosquito that Spaz was talking about months ago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess it bit somebody and now they're getting the West Nile virus.  So, they're like, screw rat eating on the O&A show.  We got to get out to Queens.  Where the hell are we?  The Amazon?  He's got to leave a rat eating story to go to some deadly mosquito virus story.  Yeah.  Next cannibalism.  I know.  Quick.  Pack up the camera.  We got pygmies eating people.  So, I don't know if we'll get any coverage on Channel 2 today or whatever, but that's all right.  We got to say hi to Brian Riggin. 
[00:50:00]  Brian.  Hey.  He walked into just a cluster.  It's pretty crowded out there today.  I checked in upstairs at the reception desk and said, yeah, I'm here to, I'm supposed to be on the Opie and Anthony show.  And some guy ran up and said, are you a rat eater?  I don't know.  Is there a new format or something?  Whatever I got to do to get in there.  You're a rat eater.  Whatever I got to do to plug my shows.  Sure, I'm a rat eater. 
[00:50:30]  You're mistaken for a rat eater.  That's pretty impressive.  You never know what's going to go on on this damn show.  I got a bone to pick with you guys.  You prepared my comedy to the comedy of Ruth Buzzi?  No.  What in the world?  No, you're getting very confused today, Brian.  Brian, you're listening with half an ear or something.  I don't know what's going on.  I'm not here dealing with the rat thing.  I'm hearing the Ruth Buzzi talk.  No, we were comparing your comedy to that of Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, I see.  Yeah, you heard that.  She kind of called up.  Yeah, well, that's courageous of her.  It really was.  You know, most of them have their publicists or something call up or file a lawsuit or something.  Get over to actually pick the phone up and give us a bitching of our own.  I almost feel like I'm obligated to date her now.  You've already gotten the yelling at me part of it over.  It's like you get caught doing something in school.  You had to go down to the principal's office.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, man.  There are repercussions here. 
[00:51:30]  Sarah Jessica Parker's on the phone to yell at you.  What?  How did that happen?  I don't know how we ever reached that point.  Oh, good.  We got the sex in the city.  Okay.  Take a look.  There we go.  Who wrote?  She's not saying eat me.  Who wrote that?  Yeah, those things are all under the buses and stuff.  Yeah, although the Empire State Building on her dress, it's a phallic thing, isn't it?  Of course it is.  Like, she's got the Empire State Building on her dress right between her legs, and it just 
[00:52:00]  looks like a giant schlong.  In place for a TF, if you really look at it.  Yeah.  And isn't that show just about effing the whole time?  Yeah.  I mean, that's it.  The girls just talk about effing.  She says it's not a chick show.  It's big time a chick show.  It's so a chick show.  I did check it out this past...  When was it on Sunday?  Here's a way to say if it's a chick show or not.  A bunch of guys hanging around the house are going to go, hey, turn on Sex in the City.  I want to see that.  Yeah, I get it confused sometimes.  It's like, up next on HBO, Sex in the City.  I'm like, oh, real sex? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no, it's that Sex in the City show.  Yeah.  I'll watch real sex.  That show's kind of cool.  But now I'm going to have to watch Sex in the City.  I've got to put a true face to who was yelling at us today.  All right.  We've got to get back on track here, Brian.  I apologize.  It's not every day that a Hollywood star yells at us, so we're regrouping here.  Where are you going to be?  He's going to be at Rascals, Anthony, tonight.  Rascals.  Russian Township, two shows, 8 o'clock and 10.30.  Tomorrow, West Orange, Rascals, 8 and 10.30.  I'm definitely going.  He's one of the funniest guys out there. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Call now, because these tickets will go fast.  You saw him for the first time at Caroline's last time.  I swear, I think I busted a bladder or something.  I was urinating blood after I saw Brian Regan.  Consult your doctor before you buy tickets.  Yeah, you wake up the next day and your ribs hurt.  It's very flattering, guys.  Very funny.  Very funny, man.  We were quoting you yesterday because that kid right there, Spaz, with the poofy hair,  he had a theory on the sun.  So we just started yelling out, the big yellow one is the sun. 
[00:53:30]  The yellow one.  The yellow one.  The yellow one is the sun.  Brian, Spaz, grab a mic.  Hey, man.  How's it going?  Good.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Look at Brian.  That's the guy I wanted to know if I was here to eat a rat.  See?  He's really got problems.  He's really got problems.  Brian's like, can I eat a rat instead of, like, talk to this kid?  He had a theory.  He's a good guy.  Oh, my God.  Things are lacking.  Tell Brian your theory on the sun, what it actually is in the sky. 
[00:54:00]  Okay.  Okay.  As opposed to what everyone else thinks it is.  Okay.  See, yesterday.  As opposed to the general consensus of it being a ball of fire.  You've got an alternate theory.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  See, last night there were some particles in the sky that radiated from the sun.  And so, basically, all right, to start from the beginning, the sun is just a big flaming rock. 
[00:54:30]  Right.  It's really cute.  Rock!  Okay.  So, yeah.  That's one hot rock.  So, basically, what happened was there was a pressurized self-implosion within the sun.  And so, this array of particles came out.  Now, I told the guys that we would not be affected because, in outer space, the particles would freeze up, thus becoming condensed into a solid state.  And when it comes to the Earth's atmosphere, it would burn up, turning into either a gaseous or liquid state, depending on the size of the particle.  Can you believe this?  That's so weird.  I was thinking the same exact thing when I was coming in today. 
[00:55:00]  I'm going, I'm wondering if that was a self-implosion.  A self-implosion?  A pressurized self-implosion as opposed to, hey, it's just hot.  A pressurized self-implosion there.  It's fast.  You know what's weird?  It's like, you know, ten years from now, he's going to be like, Harold, is the best scientist ever.  And they're going to replay this tape of the three of us.  Yeah!  Yeah, it was an implosion.  It was later proved that the sun is indeed a hot rock. 
[00:55:30]  The pressurized self-implosion.  Those particles could have hurt us if it wasn't so cold in space, thus freezing them into a solid state.  Stephen Hawking is going to call in and slam us for laughing at him.  Look at him, he's so proud, though.  Why, why are you saying that about the sun?  The kid is absolutely right.  Pressurized self-implosion.  My new theory.  Hence the big yellow one in the sun for him yesterday. 
[00:56:00]  I love that, because I always remember kids like him in school and stuff that just had the wrong idea about something,  but they were so passionate about it.  It was like they knew everything about everything.  Yeah, I know, my father's got this car and stuff, and I know the engine's like a 600-cubic-inch engine.  And he will just talk about it the whole day.  Yeah.  And you're like, you know it's not, but you can't argue with them because they have their beliefs.  Just like Spaz and the sun.  You can't tell him it's a big ball of gas.  All right, good theory, man. 
[00:56:30]  I said that he just, I know, good theory.  I say we just overheard his father when he was a kid saying, I think my son's head is a rock.  And he got this whole thing about the rock being the sun.  That's like one of those things, like if you're at a cocktail party and, you know, you're trying to mingle  and you happen to punch somebody and they hit you with that kind of thing.  You're like, whoa, okay.  Yeah, yeah, what do you do?  We're chatting with you.  I'm going to go check the punch bowl.  Where do you go from that? 
[00:57:00]  The sun.  Yeah.  You say, what about that Nick game, huh?  Yeah.  How will the sun affect the Knicks?  Okay, I got to go.  Great.  Fantastic.  So.  I want the rat guys to, uh.  Yeah, we're looking.  We're the giant rats.  We're worried.  We're hoping that the rats arrive.  If the rats don't show up, I'm going to be, someone is getting filleted and cooked and eaten.  So how many, how many rats?  I mean, like six.  Six.  Six rats.  Six big, sore city rats.  Six big, fat city rats.  Is this like a chili bake-off kind of thing? 
[00:57:30]  Pretty much.  Competing chefs.  Yeah, it's like the cooking channel.  Ready, set, cook.  Where they have to, you know, you're only given a rat a lemon, a lime, and some lettuce.  And you have to make the best dish in a half hour.  It'll be judged by our audience.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Ready, set, cook a rat.  We have a friend's chef out there, Brian.  He's got sauces, and he described the procedure, because these rats are going to come in alive.  And he's got to kill them.  Kill them and, like, gut them.  I think right about now in Brian's head, he's going, what happened to Opie and Anthony's? 
[00:58:00]  Why didn't I, yeah.  I didn't realize that that's, that chefs do that part of it.  That chefs do the actual killing.  I thought they usually don't.  I don't know who this guy is.  I think they just found some hookers and 55-gallon drums in his yard.  That guy just grabbed the chef hat off a shelf.  Come on down.  I don't know.  I'll bring a lemon alive.  Kill some animals on the radio.  It's like the Jeffrey Dahmer or something.  We're just getting in trouble. 
[00:58:30]  There's a guy in line three.  Got to go to him real fast.  He found out where Hillary lives up there in Westchester, and he's putting WOW stickers on her mailbox.  Oh, you can't do that.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, what are you doing?  You found our house?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, we know where our house is.  We're up in Chappaqua right now.  Yeah.  And, you know, we, actually, you know, we had a few drinks before, so we're trying to sober up.  That's good.  Drunk in front of the president's house.  Well, exactly.  We don't want to get...  They won't touch you.  Exactly.  We don't want to get snagged like drunk.  But I think we're sober enough now, and we have a couple of WOW bumper stickers. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, great.  Dude, instead of that, could you just light a bag of dog duty and ring his bell?  Could you see Clint going, what the hell is this?  Oh, damn, my shoes.  I wouldn't respect the news.  Let you sit down, kids.  I'll get you, kids.  Well, we got, like, 20 WOW stickers that you guys gave to us, and, you know, we're in the area.  We want to do something, but, you know... 
[00:59:30]  Great, great.  Make sure you give them to the Secret Service before they beat you up.  You know how quickly you would be wrestled to the pavement?  Hey, for you guys...  We won, Sarah.  We won, Sarah.  We won, Sarah.  For you guys, it'll be okay, though.  You know what I'm saying?  All right, Greg.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's always good.  Good luck with the WOW stickers in front of the President's house.  That's where the first family.  Yeah.  That's a wonderful, wonderful safe thing.  And forewarn the authorities by mentioning it on the radio.  Yeah.  Right.  They won't pick up on that. 
[01:00:00]  Guess where we're headed?  To the Clinton house.  To do some damning.  Our license plate number is...  Oh, I love it.  Yeah, good luck.  Great insurgents.  Yeah, Sarah Jessica Parkin can pick up on the fact that we're talking bad about her,  but Secret Service and the President will have no clue.  We don't listen.  Right, we don't.  We're listening to La Mega.  Oh, man.  Know what bit I was hoping you did at Caroline's last time? 
[01:00:30]  Your McDonald's bit.  The ordering?  Oh, the franchise.  Yeah.  That actually is sort of from a true thing, you know.  I went to the Burger King drive-thru, and I felt like an idiot.  I ordered a cheeseburger, and the lady goes, drive around.  So, I drove around for like 20 minutes.  Then I head over to McDonald's, and I got talked into buying a franchise in Pensacola, Florida. 
[01:01:00]  I didn't even know what happened.  I'm at the window.  Yeah, I'd like a hamburger.  Would you like franchise with that?  Keep Pensacola.  Yes, I do.  My little brother, when we grew up in Miami, Florida, he came home from school.  He was in kindergarten, and he came home from school and said that the teacher the next day was going to take all the kids to Pensacola. 
[01:01:30]  And my mom had to call the school going, where do you think you're taking our children?  You're going to take an 11-hour drive up to Pensacola?  And that's when I found out they were going to the Pepsi-Cola bottling plant.  But my older brother went to college up in Pensacola, so my little brother got it all mixed up.  So, I turned it into a McDonald's joke.  And give my little brother nothing.  Oh, man.  No rats yet? 
[01:02:00]  The rats have arrived?  What are you waiting for?  All right.  I was waiting for Brian to finish?  To finish the story.  Oh, great.  Next to us at the sticker stops, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Great.  Well, let me see the rats.  Mike and Danny have brought rats.  Oh, my God.  Mike and Danny have brought us some rats.  Everybody's shaking their head no.  This isn't a good sign.  Oh, my God.  Huh?  The rats fish in the box.  Oh, damn.  In the box?  A rat without manners.  Hey.  Wow.  That's nothing compared to what's going to happen. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  They're already, oh, no, it took a leak.  Wait for the consequences.  You're guillotining these things.  Here they are, man.  Let me move my coffee.  That's the very funny Brian Regan playing rascals all weekend long.  Yeah.  Call rascals.  They will go fast, the tickets.  Yes.  Very funny, guys.  Ocean Township tonight and West Orange Saturday.  So would you bring sandwiches in the box?  Yeah.  This is Mike and Danny.  They're the rat suppliers.  Oh, no.  I don't want to look.  You guys want to see them here? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Lift one up.  Lift one up.  They're in a box still, though.  Ah.  Look, it's like a little Happy Meal box, isn't it?  Lift them up.  They come with fries.  Yeah.  All right.  They're taking the rat out of there.  How big is it?  Is it big enough?  On the other side.  On the other side.  Oh, man.  Don't let him run around.  Look, he's going to try to escape.  I hate looking at the condemned.  I really do.  It's like he's in jail.  Oh.  All right.  They're trying to get the rat out of the box.  How big is it?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Okay.  All right.  Put it back in the frigging box. 
[01:03:30]  No.  Put it back in the box.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  This is not going to be fun.  All right.  Reality has just hit.  Reality has just hit.  Oh, my God.  He pulled a rat tail that was about a foot long out of the box.  And then the rat part connected to it.  We didn't get to see the rest of the rat.  No.  No.  Pull the whole thing.  No.  I don't want to see it.  Okay.  I'm leaving.  I'm leaving the show.  Pull it out.  Pull it out.  That thing was only pulled about a quarter out.  I'm leaving the program. 
[01:04:00]  It's trying to bite him.  Pull the rat out.  I want to see the whole damn thing.  Oh, my God.  Poor Brian, man.  He comes here on his day.  He's got the mic right next to the box.  Yeah.  He's got the mic right next to the rats.  I don't know if you saw it.  I just came up.  Oh, my God.  No.  No.  No.  Come on.  Okay.  Great.  This all sounded good on paper, didn't it?  It's like the Sarah Jessica Parker thing.  Eddie's going to call in now.  It's great when you're just talking about it. 
[01:04:30]  But then when Sarah Jessica called, we kind of felt bad.  Yeah.  You know, it's great talking about it, but then you look at the rat, and now I'm wondering  how the hell they're going to do this.  Steve, who's a pretty big guy, is shaking.  Hey, look at him.  French chef dude.  Grab one of those mics.  Yes.  Yeah, grab that one.  What's up?  Now, you've seen the rat.  No, I didn't see it.  Show it to me.  Oh, show the French chef guy the rat.  Hey, it's small.  Small?  That's small?  That's small.  Now, you have no reservations about clocking him over the head. 
[01:05:00]  No, no, no.  I smashed him right on the phone.  Oh, my God.  I, uh, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  It's like little pets, you know?  Yeah, like little pets.  It gets smashed on the head.  Wow.  Okay.  They're my little pets.  You want to see the other ones?  Okay, terrific.  No, I don't want to see the other ones.  Are they all the same, pretty much?  Want to see the big ones?  Yeah, the big ones.  Those are the babies.  God damn.  Well, the white ones, and the other one that we showed you is black and white, so. 
[01:05:30]  I'll call that one Spanish, because I didn't know which one it was.  Yeah, that's what?  You know what?  It is really going to be grim when he has to extinguish the life out of these things,  because I know damn well we are going to want to do it on the air, and it's going to freaking squeal.  Look, they don't just go like, okay, he's hitting me on the head with a meat cleaver.  It's okay.  You're going to hear, like, squealing.  All right, well, why don't you guys get the rats out of the studio, we'll talk to all you guys.  Put it over in the area, and then we will talk to you. 
[01:06:00]  We have rats, we have rat eaters, and we have a chef.  The only saving grace to this is.  And the comedy of Brian Riddick.  There you go, throw it in.  Squeeze in here.  Do your little drive-thru joke.  That doesn't have anything to do with what's going on here.  Well, now, the only saving grace of this whole damn cluster F is the fact that these rats were got from a store 
[01:06:30]  where they are used to feed huge snakes, so they were condemned already.  Next is the fact that they will indeed be consumed.  Yeah.  So it's completely, we have like ten people out there that want to eat the rats.  Yeah.  So that makes it like it's hunting.  Yeah, I'm trying to rationalize this, Brian.  You know, we're going to eat these rats.  It isn't like we're just killing them.  Brian, I'm trying to rationalize this so I can sleep at night, okay?  We're turning them into sandwiches. 
[01:07:00]  We're not being cruel.  Sure, the French guy's going to hit them on the head with a meat tenderizer.  But, Brian, can you do like ten minutes out there while they're firing up the rats?  I think the worst hell gig in history, put a microphone over in the corner.  I'm playing a Benihana with Batman.  I'm playing a frigging rat roast.  Fantastic.  Okay, terrific.  What a mess.  That thing was a rabbit, man. 
[01:07:30]  Did you see the size of that rat?  That thing was not a rat.  But I thought, you know, when you think rat, unless you think about the stories of New York City rats running around,  you think the little rats that you see in the tank at the pet store.  These rats are so frigging huge.  He pulled that tail out.  And you know when you think of holding a rodent by the tail, you think the thumb and forefinger and you're holding by the tail?  He had it in his fist.  He's holding this thing like a piece of rope.  And it was just more tail coming out of the box.  It was tail for days. 
[01:08:00]  And then that hind end came out.  Yeah, that.  See, I was sitting right next to you.  That thing had hemorrhoids.  I don't know how to make it more disgusting than it already is.  That's the best part.  That's good eating.  Of defending.  You know, that rat is a misery.  We're doing it a favor.  Look at that.  I bet he can't even sit down.  That back end is good eating.  Is this another chef?  We're an eater.  Oh, what's happening? 
[01:08:30]  How are you, buddy?  How are you, though?  What's your name?  My name is Chef Declan.  Chef Declan?  Chef Declan, yes.  Okay.  And you are going to prepare one of these?  Yeah, the one that's sitting on my shoulder, yes.  Now, you have no problem snuffing.  I'm going to cut his throat.  I'm going to skin him.  All right.  And I'm going to put him.  Oh, my God.  After he's been...  There's one of the words of the gang is.  That's okay.  We have buttons and things that'll...  We're on, like, a three-day delay.  You can drive home and listen. 
[01:09:00]  He just made duty in my pocket.  He just made duty in your pocket.  We had to dump out of that.  But...  Oh, boy.  He got you.  Yeah.  You were out there kissing the rat?  Yeah, sure.  I want to...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I want to see no bonding process between this rat.  Kiss of death.  Ready?  Oh.  The kiss of death.  Brian, this is normal radio, right?  You do this all over the country when you're touring, right?  Oh, man.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Looking good.  And the tails are gone. 
[01:09:30]  See what I'm saying about the...  The tails are gone.  Yeah, there's something hanging out there.  There's something hanging out there.  It has, like, a double butt or something.  It's got, like, huge testicles.  There's something wrong.  Oh, man.  This is a male rat.  It's a male rat.  Where Psycho Mark?  Okay.  All right.  Check.  I'm done.  Where Psycho Mark?  Let's put this in his hand.  How did these ideas get spawned?  It's all from that Survivor show.  That's a day.  It's all because of you guys.  Where they all have to eat rats?  It's all because of you guys, because you're the best guys in New York State. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, wow.  Look at that, Brian.  You're on the best radio show.  All over the world.  Look at somebody knows some of Brian's material.  He goes, hey, guys, it's a box and a rat-son.  Radices it is.  Rats in a box.  And it has some food is when they cut something to rat-son.  And a guy wants to know what wine goes best with bubonic plague.  Probably Chardonnay Blanc. 
[01:10:30]  I think a red wine would be fine with rat.  Well, it's red meat, so I use a white wine.  A white wine?  I thought red wine.  What kind of chef are you?  White wine goes with, like, fish and poultry.  Now, when it comes to rat...  Wait, let's get the wine guy in.  Brian, where's the wine guy?  Brian, where's the wine guy for this?  For the rat-off.  Look at this guy all well-dressed and stuff.  I thought you were, like, Brian's agent or something when you were...  I came from work.  I told you guys that.  Okay, he's...  We met, Ope.  Where?  Carrington's Melville.  My buddy Tommy was running the bar, and you came out on a Monday night with our... 
[01:11:00]  I don't want to say too much.  Your girlfriend's here.  The strippers at the halftime?  Carrington.  The poker game?  Poker.  Oh, that's from the BAB.  Yeah.  A long time ago.  So I'm glad to see you moving up is basically my point.  Yeah.  This is nice.  So you brought some wine?  Yeah.  What are you thinking?  Well, I'm making friends with...  Well, he's preparing.  There is no wine for rat.  So he's preparing.  It's based on how he's preparing it.  Okay.  He's preparing lemon, basil, rat.  So I'm going to serve Kendall Jackson Sauvignon Blanc. 
[01:11:30]  Ah.  To complement the lemon basil.  Perfect.  And I need a little bit of that to saute with.  Absolutely.  Right.  Now, what year would you go with a white and rat?  I would go with a 76.  76 Sauvignon Blanc.  I'd rather eat the rat.  Ah.  Very good.  Inside wine humor.  You know how bad that 76 matcha.  It's not as good as the 76.  After they eat the rat, I got Cabo Wabo tequila for you.  All right.  All right.  So you can wash the rat down. 
[01:12:00]  Any year of that.  Your other guy's cooking the rat in a pepper sauce.  We're going to serve Rosemont Shiraz.  Ah.  Of course.  Australian.  Of course.  Did he even have to say that?  Who doesn't know that?  I hate to state the obvious.  Yeah.  I really do.  Look at you.  Are you sure you're a chef?  I think he's just a guy that likes killing small animals.  He got some whites from where he escaped from the hospital.  There's a number of them.  He's an orderly at Bellevue. 
[01:12:30]  Honestly, I've been cooking for some...  The chef comes from Riker.  He works at a restaurant called Riker's.  I've never seen a chef's outfit with black and white stripes.  Honestly, I've been cooking for 22 years.  How much rat have you made?  Yeah.  You ever cooked rat?  Squirrel.  Squirrel?  Well, that's comparable.  Is that in my family?  It's very close, yeah.  Well, if the rat goes over...  I've eaten Rattlesnake, Turtle, Raccoon.  All right.  How much time did you spend on Devil's Island?  About five years.  Did you try something?  It's called beef. 
[01:13:00]  It's really wonderful.  I spent five years in Kentucky.  That's where that came from.  All right.  And how many 55-gallon drums are there in Kentucky under your patio?  I'm not 50.  You'll fit nice in that.  I'm from your neighborhood.  Oh, yeah?  Where?  Center Reach.  That's not my neighborhood anymore.  Well, Long Island.  Well, that's Opie's neighborhood.  No, it's not my neighborhood.  I'm from Brooklyn now.  Rick, Center Reach?  Center Reach is the poor...  Born in Brooklyn, raised in Center Reach.  Sent to Kentucky, back to Brooklyn.  There you go.  All right.  Let's get...  I want to write that down, so I'm going to do that with my son, actually. 
[01:13:30]  I'm going to follow that same cause.  Let's get to...  Yeah, do that.  Let's get to one guy.  Tending extradition, he'll...  Want me to start pulling corks?  Yeah, why don't you guys get out there and get ready to get the festivities going?  When's the killing spree going to be done?  After Brian leaves, because I don't think you can mix killing and humor.  I don't think it's...  Well, see, Opie, there's where you're wrong.  Get it going.  I'm sure, right?  Sure.  It has to be done the proper way.  All right.  All right.  And having frozen rats was not the right way to do it.  Look, look, look.  I got to...  How are we...  Where are we going to do this procedure? 
[01:14:00]  But is it going to be over a...  In a garbage pile?  No, I brought a huge cutting board with me.  Okay.  And that's the killing board.  But...  Oh, no.  I don't know.  All right.  Why don't you guys go figure that out?  It seems a little too open.  Why don't you guys figure that out?  We'll be out there in a minute.  You need some sneeze.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  And wine guy, we'll see you in a little while.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Say goodbye to Mr. Rat.  I, for one, am completely disgusted. 
[01:14:30]  So, Brian, stupid in school.  I'm trying anything here.  My God.  Yeah.  You know.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  And maybe we could have a normal break with Brian Regan.  Another Brian Regan thing.  Enjoy your rat.  You, too.  You, too.  In case you're eating rat.  Zoom.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  Audio of that chef we were just talking to. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Really.  All right.  Brian Regan in studio.  I brought some fava beans and Chianti.  One of my faves.  I'm telling you, you guys will laugh your asses off.  These shows are going to go quick.  I suggest you call right now.  Rascals tonight, Ocean Township.  Rascals tomorrow night, West Orange.  Two shows tonight and two shows tomorrow.  Okay?  Okay.  More with Brian Regan next.  Stay there.  Dudes with dudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Toby and Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  We're out of control.  We're so wacky.  All right.  Knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony, Mujan.  Yes, Mujan.  You might ask, what the hell is Mujan?  Well, I think Brian would ask that question.  Brian Regan.  I ask that question every day.  Mujan.  It's wax for waxing a woman.  I guess a guy could use it if, you know, you want to wax your ears or something.  But Mujan.  Oh, smooth skin.  You don't get that razor stubble that you get from shaving. 
[01:16:00]  The girl's most intimate area.  You don't want it to look like you have a rat.  A slaughtered rat in your lap.  Do you, girls?  That's probably the worst thing.  The panties come down.  All of a sudden, you're like, oh, my God.  It's a slaughtered rat in her lap.  You don't want to hear that in the bedroom.  No.  Is that a slaughtered rat?  Mujan.  Mujan.  It moves the hair.  It grows back thinner.  It grows back less bushy.  Course.  Very good.  Thank you.  Course. 
[01:16:30]  That's the word I was looking for.  Brian's like, what the hell happened to you guys?  Yeah, we're doing live reads for waxing ladies' cronches.  There you go.  This is the sane part of the show.  We're going to just do some abs.  Yeah.  We'll just do spots.  It could be used hot or cold, Opie.  Yeah.  It's the most comfortable way to remove hair from legs, from groin areas, armpits, faces,  backs, whatever.  Dr. Zayas says, I use Mulan. 
[01:17:00]  Right.  Oh, boy.  It's wonderful.  It is, huh?  I use it.  You sound like an expert at this point with the Mujan in.  Now, how does a Mulan?  Did I say Mulan?  Yeah.  Isn't that the Disney movie?  No, not Mulan.  The cassette.  The Disney cassette to the affected area.  And yank!  Mulan!  Oh, Mujan.  That's right.  It's Mujan.  Oh, Mujan.  I don't know.  Brian, do you have any other questions for Rand about the waxing? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, because I'm a pro.  How does it work?  You put it on, and then it heartens.  You apply it.  Yes.  And instantly, you can just tear off the hair.  It's amazing.  Women seem to be impervious to pain that you would think would be so bad, you wouldn't  be able to handle it.  Now, I don't know that much about it, but that is better than shaving the area?  Oh, you don't want a razor stubble down there.  Your cheeks get all rosy and red.  And, no, it's very good.  We love the people from Mujan. 
[01:18:00]  Guys, get Mujan for your girl.  That's one thing she wants.  Yeah.  What did you get me, honey?  I got you some crotch hair remover, honey.  And she'll love you for it.  She said you wanted me to put some thought into this.  Yeah.  Does your girl really, does it look like she has a link from the Moskwa's head in the  leg lock?  Look, if it does, she needs Mujan.  Mujan.  Mujan is available at Dwayne Reed, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve's Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus.  And if you don't see Mujan, just ask your store manager to bring it for you, Anthony. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Can you imagine that?  Mujan.  Mujan.  Opie, you're a sick ass man.  Anthony.  You're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027 WNEW.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Oh, I get it.  It's rat.  It's rat. 
[01:19:00]  All right.  We don't need to listen to rat today.  But people will be eating rats in a little while, Anthony.  They're getting ready to start the process.  But right now, we've got Brian Regan in the studio.  One of my faves.  I got to say it.  I told Brian outside, I go, Brian, I tell everyone they're one of my faves.  But when I tell you, I mean it.  He's playing Rascals tonight, Ocean Township, two shows.  I highly recommend you go see Brian Regan.  Thanks.  Tomorrow night, he's playing Rascals in West Orange for two shows.  Call for tickets, okay?  All right. 
[01:19:30]  Do you have, you know, like if these guys get queasy or sick, do you have like a medical staff standing by?  You know something?  No.  We're just thinking Dr. Garbage Pail will be there for people to whoop into.  One big bucket.  I actually had to go to the emergency room about three weeks ago.  I had like this stomach virus from hell thing.  And, you know, I showed up and they check in.  You know, you've got to sit there and do the check-in thing.  And I had to tell the guy checking me in saying, you know, before we really get anywhere, I might throw up like at any second, you know. 
[01:20:00]  The guy had a bucket on my lap so fast.  And then I'm walking around the hospital with a bucket.  How can you possibly look cool when you're holding your own bucket, you know?  Walking around trying to talk to people.  Yeah, this is my bucket.  I'm proud of my little bucket.  A puke bucket.  That's awful.  You know, if you feel good enough, you can go hit like a nightclub, you know, walk around with your bucket.  Hey, I couldn't help but notice you looking at my bucket. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, this is in case I ralph.  So what are you doing later?  How about you, me, and my bucket?  Take it on outside, you know?  A puke bucket.  Fortunately, I didn't, you know, have to do that while I was there.  You'll never see people move faster than when you say, I think I'm going to throw up.  Oh, man.  Like looking for anything.  A posting stamp.  I've got to find something.  It's your world, man.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  You can do whatever you want when you might throw up.  Especially in a car.  Yeah.  You know, your friend's car.  I think I'm going to puke.  Starts being a hot spin.  I was in the back of a cab one time, and I was going to an airport like at 7 o'clock in the morning.  And all I had said to the cab driver was, you know, I need to get to the airport.  That's the only thing I had said.  Until like halfway there, I said, I'm going to throw up right now.  The guy pulled over like six lanes of traffic.  Not in my cab.  Not in my cab.  You know.  And he pulled over, and I was like, whoa. 
[01:21:30]  That's called an air freshener for a cab, though.  I'll tell you.  I was in.  I swear.  I hopped in a cab the other day, and I just had to go a couple of blocks, and I got out.  I got out after like a block.  This is good.  I swear to God.  It's like the guy soaked his feet in Swiss cheese.  It was that bad.  Like, really?  I thought you were going up the roadway on 76.  No, no.  This is fine.  I just really didn't want to walk.  I saw something crack in the road, and I'm superstitious. 
[01:22:00]  Break your mother's back thing.  I figured I'd drive over it.  Thank you, feet guy.  I could use the exercise, yeah.  It's terrible.  That's a riot, man.  Stinky cab guy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Boy, we're really trying to get our minds off the rest, but it ain't working.  It really isn't working.  It's like trying to cheer someone up at the funeral, you know?  You're talking, and occasionally you get like a ha-ha-ha.  They're still dead.  They're still dead. 
[01:22:30]  It doesn't matter.  The cheering up just doesn't really work at the funeral.  Every topic you bring up goes right back to it, you know?  Hey, did you see that ball game?  You know, he liked basketball.  He liked basketball.  He liked basketball.  Thanks for bringing his favorite sport up.  Cruel.  Heartless you are.  Man, I got caught in some traffic coming here.  He used to get caught in traffic.  But now he's dead.  But now he's dead. 
[01:23:00]  Why do you keep talking about him?  He's supposed to be cheering me up.  Yeah.  Well, in ten minutes, we're going to start the rat.  Ten minutes?  Yeah.  Great.  The chef, look at it.  He's biting at the bit over there.  He's ready to go, the French chef.  His mind is just like racing at what he can do with these rats.  You consider those small rats, though, right?  Yep.  Where are you from?  The Bronx?  Yeah, he lives in a subway platform. 
[01:23:30]  What scale are you using?  Like electric train sets.  Is this HO scale?  I'm using the metric scale.  The metric.  Oh, yeah, it's metric rats.  Very small, of course.  Keep the jokes to Brian, all right?  No.  There you go.  You cook the rat.  Brian tells the jokes.  No problem.  I'll be telling the joke tonight.  What are you talking?  The metric rat bit.  That was pretty good.  Are you going to use the tail or anything as a garnish? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, why not?  Oh, and with a little lemon basket.  Lemon basket, exactly.  This just sounds adorable.  But what happened?  I mean, you're the chef.  What's happening now?  Shouldn't you be, like, sharpening knives or something?  Let me go free for today.  I think they're waiting.  I think the slaughter is going to take place like that.  Yeah, like we said, we're trying to separate the horror from the comedy.  Yeah, we want to separate, you know, tragedy from comedy, much like my life.  Yeah.  I don't want to be perceived as standing in the way of the rat slaughter. 
[01:24:30]  Everybody out there in their car going.  As soon as that clown gets out of the studio, they start killing rats.  And he's in there telling his little nickel-dime jokes.  I know.  Like, you ever notice when you're driving, would you shut up, Ho-Ho?  You're like Greenpeace with the whales, you know?  Wait, I've got another one.  This is a little ditty I've been working on.  How come when you go to the mall, shut up, circus clown. 
[01:25:00]  We want to hear cats, or cats, rats get killed, and cats.  Bring cats and rats and dogs.  Start killing animals.  Oh, my God.  Man.  Yeah.  I've heard a following, Hart.  I've got to precede a rat slaughter.  You go on, you do your thing, then we kill rats.  Warming up for the gladiators.  You do that cute joke about you two.  In case you ever kill a rat. 
[01:25:30]  I'm just feeling really, like, queasy about the whole thing.  I'd actually like to watch that.  I mean, I don't know if we can move that up.  Oh, that's no problem.  Yeah, I'm into this, you know?  No problem.  You want to, like, maybe start?  Yeah.  Yeah, we can do that.  I just want to apologize to Brian.  I promise there will be no executions next time you visit us.  I don't want you to think, you know, this is what it's going to be like next time you're here.  What are you doing here, man?  You think this is going to be something I'm ever going to forget? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, that's true.  I just don't know about the cutting board thing out there.  He says he's got a big cutting board, but I'm thinking of, like, overflow.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that rat was pretty huge.  Yeah, I'm thinking he's going to have to be over a container, not just a flat surface.  Yeah, why don't we do this?  Something called liquid properties in gravity.  You know what I mean?  Let's get that theory guy back.  No, you don't have to.  You don't have to worry about that.  That is a rat brain implosion. 
[01:26:30]  Spaz, Brian wants to ask you something.  We have a question.  The theory of the rat slaughter, what do you think is going to take place?  What's going to take place?  Yeah.  I'm not sure how to prepare a rat, but I would think that if you disconnect the brain from the rest of the body,  see, the spinal cord to the brain is what provides, you know, movement and life, you know, along with the heart.  So if you separate the spinal cord, you know, which is also attached with veins.  I know all this.  I don't know anything, man.  Sever the head.  The body will wiggle for a couple minutes of life because of the heart rate is pumping through the body still. 
[01:27:00]  So it might move around.  So you might want to contain it after you chop off the head.  Ah, there we go.  That's great.  You know what?  If you're like my call-in lifeline on who wants to be a millionaire, I'd have to constantly be saying,  30 seconds.  We've only got 30 seconds.  I know you love when they get cut off.  The spine is connected to it.  Give me an answer.  I'd say the answer.  I'm 100% sure. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  You seem to have run out of time.  Horrible.  I saw that the other night.  I was laughing.  Oh, this is tough.  It's between two of them.  I'm 75% sure I'm going to have to go.  Oh, he seems to have run out of time.  I don't understand how that happened.  Oh, man.  All right.  Let's start killing.  Yeah, let's do this.  Let's start killing.  Let's get to the killing fields.  This isn't about killing.  It's about cooking.  We're celebrating life and food and eating with loved ones and family. 
[01:28:00]  Anthony, so far we had Sarah Jessica Parker yell at us.  We've had the comedy stylings of Brian Regan.  We're going to have a slaughterhouse in a few minutes.  And then we've got hot strippers coming in at 6 o'clock to end the day.  Are you kidding?  No.  Where did they come from?  Hot strippers.  Can we gut them and eat them?  It's like none of this belongs with anything else.  Yeah.  This is such a hodgepodge.  Find the common denominator. 
[01:28:30]  Then Mother Teresa will be joining us.  Right.  Then we're going to skewer a live horse.  More political commentary.  Then we'll talk about the Senate race.  Get your views on that.  Oh, man.  What can I tell you?  But Brian Regan playing tonight.  Ocean Township Rascals.  Please go.  He's really funny.  Two shows.  And tomorrow at the West Orange Rascals.  Two shows.  Thanks.  I was told to mention that the Saturday night show is part of that Toyota Comedy Festival. 
[01:29:00]  Ah.  Very, very good.  Okay.  Well, Brian's sticking around for a few more minutes because he wants to check out the festivities.  Yeah.  I guess when we come back, are we going to be outside in the killing fields?  Yes.  In the pens?  I guess they'll be nice and tender because they were kept in little boxes like veals.  It's like a veal ratlet.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if that affects them, but...  And Brian's going to show off his comedy skills by just riffing as... 
[01:29:30]  As the blood is pumping.  He's going to be...  Brian's going to riff.  I think I saw that Mr. Popeil out there with his...  He's putting a rat on the thing.  Just set it and forget it.  It cooks in its own juices, you see.  The George Foreman lean, mean, fat-burning, rat-grilling machine.  And look, on the top, you'll have some nice vegetables.  Cook it all at once.  Good for the whole family.  And the rat flavoring will be in the asparagus and the broccoli. 
[01:30:00]  God damn.  What happened?  Where did my life turn that I'm condemning rats to death for food?  On the radio.  What, are we doing some raw or something?  I don't know.  You know something?  If I'm not feeling too good about it, there's probably some activists out there that are  really pissed.  Really pissed.  Anthony's moral compass is like...  Oh, I'm in the Bermuda Triangle with my compass. 
[01:30:30]  I don't know.  Oh, believe me, I'll get over it.  I don't really care.  Once the strippers get here.  Yeah, they cure everything.  They really do.  It brings everyone together.  We had a race riot going on in here once, I swear, we had a panel of black gentlemen and  some white gentlemen, and they were confronting issues of the day and really getting just brutal  with each other.  It was getting scary, yeah.  We brought in some nude women.  They had their arms around each other.  They're laughing. 
[01:31:00]  Kumbaya.  The white guys are calling the black guys my nigga.  And there was love in the air as long as the boobs were bouncing.  One girl had to leave, she had to take a little bathroom break, and the guys started getting  edgy again.  We had to keep nudity around them at all times, but it seems to cure everything.  You got to do that with the Mideast Peace Talk.  Don't forget about it.  You know what land you need?  It's yours.  I don't care.  Check out her.  Look at the cans on her.  All right. 
[01:31:30]  Take the West Bank.  It's yours.  We'll be back with the festivities.  We'll call it that next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, Opie.  The Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  Oh, my God.  You can get these things at Sharper Image.  We went out to dinner after the show last night, and Rick shows up at the restaurant on  his Razor Rollerboard Scooter.  He was riding it through, what, Central Park?  No, Ben tried it in Central Park.  Was that last night, too?  I heard Rick took a little header on his Razor Rollerboard Scooter. 
[01:32:00]  But no worse for wear.  The scooter took it.  Let me tell you, the scooter looked great after I took that spill.  Yeah.  It landed on my ass, and people laugh, but, you know, you shouldn't ride them on the sidewalks.  No, it's cool.  It's, you know, you're extreme.  You're flying.  And then I bought it again when I was taking it home from the train, from the train to my  house, and I was scooting down the road, and I tried to jump the curb with it.  And you're not an expert enough to be jumping things with your Razor Rollerboard Scooter. 
[01:32:30]  All, Rick?  All my wife heard from inside the house was, ah!  All, Rick?  Yeah.  Jeffrey Dahmer's making Brian Regan nervous.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, man.  Look at Brian, standing next to one of his chefs with a rat on his shoulder.  Brian, I pick up on everything.  He started small talk with you, and you're like, yeah, that's great.  Oh, my God, I hope someone notices that he has a butcher knife, and he's got a leaf cleaver 
[01:33:00]  and a rat blood dripping from it, and he's over there chit-chatting.  He'll look you out on your face like, I hope someone notices soon.  All right, the Razor Rollerboard Scooter, and I'd say it's the hottest new product this  summer, gleaming stainless steel and aluminum in-line scooter.  Yep.  Yeah, we have fun with these things.  Up and down the hallways, we're hazards to each other on these things, but they're a lot  of fun.

Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027 WMW in New York. 
[01:34:30]  All right, Anthony.  I think we're outside the studio.  I think we're back in the air.  You think we are?  Well, I know.  That's one sure thing.  We are outside the studio.  Brian Regan didn't leave.  I'm very surprised.  Yeah, he's hanging for this.  He's got to watch this.  You know, there are certain things you might not want to watch, but given the opportunity,  you have to.  You're here.  What the hell, right?  Yeah.  All right, let's set the scene in.  What's going on out there?  Oh, my God.  Well, this is like Ready, Set, Cook on the Food Network. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, my God.  All right, we got to tell you, we have two chefs that ended up coming down here.  We got the French chef.  Who seems pretty normal.  Yeah, and then we got...  Yeah.  He is, though.  And then we got the chef that we've labeled Jeffrey Dahmer.  Psycho chef.  Psycho chef, normal chef.  Someone check any refrigerators or freezers he may have in his basement.  Now, psycho chef, the rat that he's about to prepare, took a dump on his cutting board. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Right next to the onion.  Oh, he sanitized it, I guess, with some Cabo Wabo tequila or something.  I don't know.  I am...  Do you see what he does when he cut his clothes?  Oh, see.  All right, listen, he's a little too into this.  A little too into...  See, I was putting, like, the killing of the rat at, like, out of 100, like, five.  Yeah.  And then the cooking and eating is the rest of the 95% of what's going on.  Correct.  He is, like, 100% kill, kill, kill. 
[01:36:00]  He's going to kill the rat and go, I don't even know how to cook and leave.  I'm convinced that's what he's going to do.  Isn't that how Jeffrey Dahmer started, too?  Yeah.  He's talking to just no one, and he doesn't have a mic.  We're going to have to get another mic set up so the cooks can...  Okay.  You didn't know the rats are going to be live?  No.  It's the only way they are.  They're fresh.  Okay.  All right, listen, the French chef recommended that the rats were alive, right?  Yes, that's right. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, they would have to be alive because the frozen ones, you don't know how long they've  been frozen, if they've been thawed and then refrozen.  Boy, we don't want anybody getting any disease.  And you can't cut them.  Yeah, then you have to thaw them out.  And it's going to be tough like hell.  And fresh rat.  Yeah, you want fresh rat.  You don't want frozen rat.  No, we've got six faithful, and I mean faithful listeners down here to eat the rat, Anthony.  How are you guys feeling?  You ready or what?  Right on, man.  Let's go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, drink a little more of what's in that cup.  You're going to need it. 
[01:37:00]  Now, I'm really a little leery about listening to this procedure, the beginning part.  I'll listen to them crackling in the pan and everything else, but I know damn well that  when one of these things gets cracked over the head, it's not just going to go, oh.  Ouch.  Ouch.  Well, I think the reaction of the 20 to 25 people seeing this will be enough, Anthony.  Let me just say, maybe this. 
[01:37:30]  You remember just when they pulled him out of the box alive, what that reaction was.  Yeah, yeah.  We were horrified.  That was a living rat.  Now, he's going to pound him over the head.  That's his technique.  Wait, wait.  Let's ask the French chef.  What's the technique?  I'm just going to smash him on his neck.  That's it.  Not the head, not the body, the neck.  That's it.  Can I say it's going to be done in a humane?  I'll make sure nobody actually sees it. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, okay.  See, the French chef is going, I'll make sure nobody actually sees it.  Okay.  All right.  That's good.  I really do not feel like glorifying the killing portion of this program.  The best part is eating it.  Well, yeah, there you go.  That's just what I was thinking.  The best part's eating it.  Now, Jeffrey Dahmer, how are you going to dispose of the rat there?  I mean, how are you going to do the...  Yeah, how will you...  I'm trying to be polite, but...  How will you extinguish the life spark out of that small mammal? 
[01:38:30]  I'm going to grab him by the back of the neck with the cloth.  I'm going to take the meat cleaver.  I'm going to break his neck.  Very slightly slit his wrists, his back legs, and then pull the skin off very slightly  and fillet the meat off his body.  Okay.  Horrific.  Great.  Great.  Fantastic.  Oh, my God.  That's what being a carnivore is all about, isn't it?  I think Peter that's listening in feels much better about the show now after hearing that description. 
[01:39:00]  How many of you joined?  To tell you the truth.  Brian Regan, hang with us.  Brian, do you want to maybe tell a joke before I...  Yeah.  Funny thing about buying shoes.  It's just...  I don't know.  I guess we just have to forge ahead and get over this part so we can get to the cooking.  No, but he has a good, like, Fig Newton joke.  Okay.  Yeah, if we could just slam on the brakes here for a second. 
[01:39:30]  You're...  Oh, but you're terrible, man.  Fig Newton's, they say that, you know, it's only a serving size is two.  Come on.  I eat big Newtons by the sleeve.  All right, break its little neck.  All right.  All right, look.  All right, wait, wait.  He's going for the...  I can't watch.  All right, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[01:40:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's move closer, Anthony.  No, I'm not moving closer.  Wait a minute.  Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  We've got to describe what's going on here.  All right.  I've got to wear these clothes on stage tonight.  I cannot look.  Okay, Jeffrey Dahmer.  Hold on, hold on.  Here we go.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The cleaver's backwards.  Yeah, it's supposed to be.  It's supposed to be.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:40:30]  I won't.  Make it firm.  Make it quick and painless.  On three.  One, two.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, no, no.  I knew this would happen.  I'm going to puke.  Dude, do it again.  Dude, hit him with your head.  Do you want to see it?  No, no.  Who didn't wet the sponge? 
[01:41:00]  Who didn't wet the sponge?  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, you don't need to.  He's dead.  Oh, he ain't dead.  Nothing to see here.  Nothing to see here.  Move along, people.  Move along.  Nothing to see here.  Oh, okay.  Oh, man.  That's a...  Hey, Brian, did you bring that puke bucket from earlier?  This is my bucket.  That's what it's all about.  That's what it's all about.  Daddy, what happened to Fluffy?  Gosh.  All right, look.  I am horrified.  Look, I'm not kidding. 
[01:41:30]  I think I've got to go puke.  I'm horrified.  I'm horrified.  Jeff Norris, what are you thinking?  This guy needs counseling or something.  Okay, I...  Oh, my God.  Hang on.  Another thing about these big Newtons.  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of this.  Oh, my God.  All right.  The other rat is dumping in the box.  I want to start a religious programming show now.  I just want to leave this.  Are you really going to eat this? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, we've got guys that are going to eat this.  All right, wait, wait.  Jeffrey Dahmer is now filleting the rat.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I can't watch.  I cannot watch this.  Oh, my.  Now, here's the second technique on the left.  You're going to miss the...  Oh, my God.  Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.  He's giving it CPR.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  We got...  That rat's fighting back.  All right, we got Jeffrey Dahmer.  That's filleting the dead rat over there.  We got the normal French chef getting ready to... 
[01:42:30]  dispose of the life of this rat.  We're all normal.  This is horrifying.  I'm horrified.  I can't watch.  I can't watch.  This is going to...  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Off with the little feet.  Oh, no.  Okay.  I have a suggestion.  I say we rent a van and we all go straight to confession.  This is the most horrific thing I've ever seen. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, what's the $10,000 back?  All right.  He's...  And Jeffrey Dahmer is...  I can't look at Jeffrey Dahmer.  ...is getting the rat ready for cooking.  Jeffrey Dahmer is flipping the...  Oh, my God.  Oh, gee.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Holy cow.  That was...  The chef can't even handle it, eh?  I have such severe heebie-teebies. 
[01:43:30]  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  It's safe to say that we're dealing with dead rats now.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy cow.  Give me a bucket.  Oh, don't look.  Hey, no.  That's my bucket.  I'll expel this game of bucket.  Drink some iced tea.  Oh, he drinks some iced tea.  Oh, my God.  Boy, I found my line.  My line.  I found my threshold here.  Wow. 
[01:44:00]  This is like a crime scene.  All right.  We need the police to get the F out of here.  We want to talk to some of the guys that are going to eat the rats, Anthony.  Yeah, I'll talk to you.  All right.  What's your name, man?  Mike.  Hey, Mike.  Where are you from?  Mayapack.  After seeing what you just did, you have no problem eating the rats in about 15 minutes?  It's got to taste like chicken, you know?  It looks like chicken.  It has to.  I can't imagine it tasting bad.  It's like pheasant, but not.  You know what it is? 
[01:44:30]  I have to wait before I can even look at that table until there is no hair left and it just  looks like little chunks of meat.  That's where moonja comes into play.  All right.  Whatever that product is.  Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Jeffrey Dahmer is just.  Jeffrey Dahmer just.  Ah!  Ah!  He just put the head in his mouth.  He's doing impressions.  Security, security, security, security, security.  Jeffrey Dahmer just took.  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[01:45:00]  All right.  He just took the meat paper to the head of the rat.  All right.  And then he took the head off.  Okay, look.  And put it in his mouth.  Hey, guys.  He is in-effing-sane.  I got to get to my therapy, guys.  This is, uh.  Get that away from me.  I feel dirty.  So, Brian.  Look at Jeffrey Dahmer's hands now.  All right.  All right.  So.  Look, look. 
[01:45:30]  They're gutting and skinning.  They're gutting and skinning the rat.  And it is the most horrible part of the, uh, procedure.  Oh, by the way, can I have your face into a hat?  Yeah, you can make that into a hat.  Look at his face, man.  He's got blood hanging out of his mouth.  Jeffrey Dahmer has blood on the corner of his mouth.  You know what's not fair?  No one is talking about the wine.  All right. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  Jeffrey Dahmer.  Gutting it.  Jeffrey Dahmer has his rat almost ready for cooking, Anthony.  Yes, yes, he does.  It's completely skinned.  The tail's still on it.  There's no head.  He has not filleted it yet.  He has just, uh, skinned it, beheaded it, and now he's gutting it.  I hear a part of it.  He's a babysitter.  Oh, my God.  The French chef taking a hell of a lot more time preparing the rat than Jeffrey Dahmer did.  Well, this isn't a timed event, Anthony.  I understand that. 
[01:46:30]  Jeffrey Dahmer's hands are totally covered with blood.  He looks like a serial killer.  He's got rat blood.  He's got rat blood.  Can we say this again?  He has rat blood all around his mouth.  All around his mouth, because he had the rat head in his mouth, and all over his hands,  he has rat blood.  Oh, my God.  So, Brian, if only we could say this was all just a weird play.  Yeah.  You know?  You might believe it like that War of the Worlds thing, you know?  Oh, he just hacked the tail off. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  All right.  So, Brian has another joke for everyone.  Yeah, Brian, why don't you cut the tension with some comedy?  Actually, I do need to run.  I've got to get to the show one time.  Yeah, but could you light a candle down at the church for me, Brian?  Yeah, stop by St. Patrick's Cathedral for me. 
[01:47:30]  All right.  Well, we'll let Brian get the hell out of here.  It doesn't feel obligated to stay here for this match.  Thanks.  We sacrifice a baby next time you come in.  It's going to be great.  I promise I will never be the same.  Yeah, Brian Regan appearing at Rascals Ocean Township tonight for two shows.  Very funny guy.  All right.  We're all going tomorrow night when he plays West Orange Rascals two shows.  Enjoy your meal here, guys.  See you guys.  Let's hear it for Brian Regan.  All right.  Take care.  Thanks.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  There he goes.  He's running out of the studio.  Watch your headphones, Brian.  There you go.  I've never seen a...  You don't want to stumble, trip, and fall on the dead rats.  Anthony, I've never seen...  Anthony, I've never seen a guest leave so fast.  This is Brian Regan.  Yeah, I know.  Look at him run.  He just set the guest leaving record.  He's running down the hallway.  I need a little more of you.  He can't get out.  What's going to happen when he gets out?  Is he going to get in that hallway and just go, oh, my God, what did I just see?  All right.  Anthony, I will not get closer to the table, Opie. 
[01:48:30]  I'm real close.  No, no.  That'll be enough.  I may stretch it.  He's saying that he needs more rat, Anthony.  I don't think we could go through that process again.  I couldn't.  Trust me.  You have plenty of rats, sir.  Yeah.  There's enough rat there.  Just make do with what you got.  We'll give the rest to the rats.  We'll let them go in the city.  Who else is eating rat? 
[01:49:00]  You're eating rat, bro?  What's your name?  Yeah, you can take that rat home.  He's my pet.  He'll be your pet.  All right.  Anthony, I'm talking to Ben.  He's going to be eating some rat in a little bit here.  I don't know.  I think we need him to kill another one.  I'm pretty hungry here.  Oh, my God.  You're nuts.  You're absolutely nuts.  I can't believe it.  All right.  I'm horrified.  Jeffrey Dahmer is just about ready for cooking.  The French chef is taking a lot more time preparing his rat for the skillet.  Oh, my God.  There's rats laying on cutting boards. 
[01:49:30]  Every so often, the reality of this just hits me in the face, Opie.  Are we getting digital pictures of this for Steve's website?  Steve's rolling film, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  There's nothing to see here right now.  Move along.  So let's take a break.  And when we get back, I...  Move along, people.  Move along.  I'm serious this time.  Anybody remaining will be placed under arrest.  Okay.  We have...  All right.  They're just about ready to start up the skillet. 
[01:50:00]  So why don't we take a break?  Well, please.  Let's do that.  I've got to get something to drink.  And we'll check in with the rat-eating next.  It's Opie and Anthony on WNEW.  I got to see a Tomo.  Tomo with a capillage.  For Ronnie.  Kanzo Radio.  Morning.  Well, you've got to get a dinner.  You've got to get a man waiting to take booze.  Oh, God.  Okay.  Plus, myself.  Opie and Anthony.  It's almost not fair to people to put this garbage in front of them. 
[01:50:30]  One of them.  One of them.  We'll be set up.  One of them.  One of them.  One of them.  Okay, Anthony.  Um...  Fidelity Diamond.  I feel a little woozy.  I had to take a walk.  I had to take a walk.  That part was just the worst.  All right, Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist. 
[01:51:00]  They'll make sure you're getting the best biop.  You forgot the diamond district.  Okay, look, I just dumped out.  Why would they write that on the copy?  I won't do this spot until who's in charge of this copy?  Oh, my God.  Why would they write that?  What do they write?  What part now?  Oh, my God.  What are they battling upstairs like dogs?  Oh, boy. 
[01:51:30]  What?  That's beautiful.  That's beautiful.  They make us look like idiots.  They scratch it out in the original copy and then write it in, in pen.  Oh, whatever.  So, basically, now they want us to trash another business that we just encourage people to go to.  Yeah.  I ain't doing that. 
[01:52:00]  Not doing that.  We look stupid.  Bunch of jackasses.  Anthony, Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist, will make sure you're getting the best biop, Anthony.  Yeah.  We got to go there.  I'll say forget the diamond district, and I'll say forget the malls, okay?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Fidelity Diamond will get, uh, will get a complete, when you, there's a car, at Fidelity Diamond, you will get a, it doesn't even make sense.  All right, I'm getting pissed.  Okay, Fidelity Diamond, you know what it is.  Engagement ring specialist, they educate you about buying your diamonds, Opie. 
[01:52:30]  Thank you, Anthony.  You pick out your diamond loose, and you pick out your setting, and they put it together right in front of you.  You know what you're getting.  There's no, uh, nobody trying to rip you off.  And if you want to sell them onto diamonds, turn them into instant cash.  Fidelity Diamond has a diamond buying service.

[01:53:00]  201-261-261-6555.  201-261-6555.  Fidelity Diamond, right on Route 17 South in Paramus, just minutes from Manhattan and Rockland County.  Call Fidelity Diamond, 201-261-6555.  201-261-6555.  All right, you won't get ripped off if you go to Fidelity Diamond, because they educate you.  That's the thing we want to tell everyone, okay?  Right.  It's Fidelity Diamond, Anthony. 
[01:53:30]  I'm just f***ing around.  Here we go.  Oh.  Anthony, our genius, gets lost.  All right.  I'm going to cut the crap on this end, I can tell you that.  1027-WNEW.  Wow.  It's the O&A Show.  Wayne and I are taking a break back in the studio.  Wreck.  It's what's for dinner.  I had to walk down the hallway.  Take a little walk.  Yeah, I came right back into the studio.  A lot of people said I turned white. 
[01:54:00]  You know, I don't know about anyone else, but I have to break the no drinking in the studio rule today.  I'm sorry.  I think so.  Fire me if you have to, but I can't go on.  We got these little bottles of a Cabo Wabo tequila.  I think I'm going to be down in some of this stuff.  What do you think, Sammy?  Yeah, that's what I think.  So, what is going on out there right now?  They're just about ready to start cooking. 
[01:54:30]  They have prepared the meat and are ready to cook, Anthony.  So, we'll go out there in a few minutes, but we've got to talk to some of our listeners.  I want to stress, anybody listening, that they were put to their demise very quickly.  And I guess as well as you could do it, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  As well as a cook or a hunter or whatever it is, takes care of live animals right before they're ready to skin them and cook them. 
[01:55:00]  Well, that's the reality, though.  But it was just, it was too much for me.  Yeah, it was, I don't know.  I'm speechless.  I couldn't even get near the table.  I was against the back wall, and I didn't watch the procedure.  There's like a commotion going on out there.  It's like a party.  What's going on down there?  What's going on?  What's going on?  It's a party out there.  What's going on?  Oh, just telling jokes and kicking back and having some wine.  All right. 
[01:55:30]  The listeners are getting ready to eat the rat, Anthony.  Well, they've got to cook it, right?  Yeah.  They're getting ready to throw it on the fire and prepare something.  You know what?  I think now that the smell might, like, put me over the top.  Oh, look.  The strippers have arrived, Dan.  Oh, good.  You're better already.  I think, oh, do you think the smell now is going to get to you?  I've never felt like that.  Ben, what's the matter?  It smells.  It smells like that.  You can smell it.  Did they start cooking?  It smells like it is.  Did they start cooking, or is it just dead rat smell in the air? 
[01:56:00]  No, I wasn't out there, so.  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  I don't know.  Matt, Matt, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  How are you?  Oh, my God.  I have a question.  Who's the one who used the cleaver?  The Jeffrey Dahmer?  They both did.  They both did.  They said it.  Did you do background checks on these guys?  Because from the graphic description you guys were given, it sounds like they've done this before.  Well, they have with other animals.  Like, they've cooked squirrels.  Oh, my.  I actually had to turn down the radio because they went. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, my God.  Get me a freaking pound.  Get me a pound.  Dude, what's the matter?  You'll smell it in a minute, man.  Oh, man.  The odor coming through this goddamn door.  What are they cooking?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, Matt.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I can't say I blame you.  They went to cut off the heads.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Opie is now leaning over a bucket.  I'm not going to.  The smell has walked into the studio. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are they cooking?  Is that what the smell is?  Yes.  Dude, it's brutal.  It's brutal.  Hey, go out there.  No, I.  Just go out there.  No.  Go out there.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  All I heard was her start coughing.  All right, Matt.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Hey, guys.  All I can say is this may be sick, but this is one of your best shows yet, man. 
[01:57:30]  No, Disney, no train wreck radio.  This is top quality.  Wait till we see the pictures.  No, listen.  Get Rick to get the field mic on the skillet so people can hear the rat.  It's turned up.  It's turned up.  Rick.  Is that the rat simmering in the pan?  Yeah.  Listen.  Listen closely.  Shh, shh, shh.  Ah!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God! 
[01:58:00]  Dude, that's rat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rat.  Yeah.  Simmering.  You smell it coming through the door?  Yes.  Oh.  Oh, he just said, can you smell it coming through the door?  Yeah.  It.  That's Jeffrey Dahmer.  $200 on the line.  First person to puke.  No.  I think it tastes very good.  You'll see.  All right.  Thank you.  It tastes very good.  That's the French chef.  Listen to that rat. 
[01:58:30]  Hold on.  Is that bone?  Sizzling rat.  Uh, Ron, from this concert, I saw a guy with a WOW sticker on his window throwing up on  the side of the road on the way home earlier.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Uh, Dennis, what's going on?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, what's happening?  How are you?  I was going down to the rise highway.  William Floyd was stuck in traffic, and I saw some lady, uh, throw up right out of a  window, I guess, right about when she said, uh, he had the rat in his mouth. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah, the rat head, not the, not the rat, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, I'm  stuttering now, the rat head, head, in his mouth.  Yeah, she just, she just rolled down the window and hurled, man, big chunks and everything.  All right, Dennis.  It was absolutely great.  You guys will.  Later.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  You smell that, right, Ed?  And we thought that Sarah Jessica Parker was correct.  Hey, guys, what's up?  Yeah.  He's doing a flambé. 
[01:59:30]  He just flambéed the rat.  There's a three-foot flame.  Everyone is...  All right, uh, Tim, what's going on?  Hey, guys, how are you?  Great.  All right, uh, how much of the, how much of the rat are the guys going to have to eat?  Uh, just a bite, or?  These guys are, these guys will eat every single, uh, piece of it.  Oh, my God.  I mean, because I, I'm actually, like, down near the hard rock, because I've been asking  to come up, and, uh, because I'm kind of hungry myself.  No.  I wasn't allowed up.  We literally have 50 people up here, man. 
[02:00:00]  We can't let anyone else up today.  Well, if anybody chickens out, uh, I'll come on up.  All right, man.  Thank you, Tim.  All right.  I just had to do one.  I already, oh, my God.  I already did one down the hall.  Open the door.  I'm going to...  Open the door!  Ben is ready to puke!  Ben, give me the first one! 
[02:00:30]  Go ahead, Ben.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Take the puke bucket.  Ben went behind the machinery there.  Ben is the most squeamish.  No, I can't handle this.  Jeff Norris!  Jeff, did you just...  Jeff, I think Jeff just booped.  No one is, like, looking anymore.  Jeff, get on mic.  I think that mic's still working.  Oh, I smell just cooking that.  I smell just rat cooking.  Put some...  When are they going to put some other stuff on it, like, um... 
[02:01:00]  No, no, that's okay.  Look at the judo champion.  Look at Gorilla Boy.  Look at her paws, man.  I'm not handling this too well, but you're turning green over there.  It's disgusting, man.  He's a combination of Joe Pesci and Mark.  He's sick.  Joe Pesci's character from, uh...  Yeah, yeah, I mean, he's...  From Goodfellas.  Can you imagine?  He goes, yeah, you take the hook, the foot, the tail, skin the freaking thing, and I'm  going to cook it.  It's rat, man.  I'll set it down tomorrow.  It's caught in the grill. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, it's just what's a foot.  It's a hoof.  It's a hoof.  It's Paul.  All my life, I wanted to be a serial killer rat cook.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I was supposed to meet a friend for a drink.  I'm too nauseous.  I got to go home.  Two shots at Pepto-Bismol.  I am so nauseous.  Yeah, Mike.  I can't believe how nauseous this radio is making me.  Yeah.  We're supposed to...  Unbelievable.  You guys are the best.  All right.  Yeah, this makes us the best.  Nice.  Thanks, Mike.  Take it easy.  All right.  God, I forgot about that.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, I just threw up on the side of the LIA.  Yeah, well, you're not alone.  I was ready to hurl again listening to you guys.  Yeah.  All yakking in the studio and stuff.  I can only imagine what the hell they think in Don and Mike's studio right now, because  Don and Mike are broadcasting live right now, and you'll hear them at 7 o'clock, the  tape delay.  There's just wafting rat smoke going into the studio.  I don't know what the hell they must be thinking.  Why don't we get Psycho Mark to prepare some rat and break into their radio show? 
[02:02:30]  Offer Don and Mike some rat.  Yeah, get Psycho Mark in here.  He's brave enough to do that.  Get him.  Oh, Jesus, man.  This guy is the sickest F I've ever seen in my life.  By the way, we did check his credentials, and he does work for a restaurant and all that.  I think he's trying to just...  Welcome to Hitler's Cafe.  He's trying to really push us.  Yeah.  He's trying to push us and have fun with it.  And it's working.  And this is the type of bit you don't need to push it.  It is what it is, but the guy figures, oh, I'll really whack it up. 
[02:03:00]  He's scary.  Is this mic on for you?  Psycho Mark, talk in the...  Yeah, talk in the...  All right, dude, this is what we want you to do.  All right, when the rat is prepared, okay?  When the rat is prepared...  I'm stuttering like crazy now.  We want you to put it on some of the bread that the chef's brought and stuff, okay?  And prepare a really nice plate.  And we want you to break into Don and Mike's studio.  They're broadcast live from New York today.  They'll be on tape delay starting at 7.  And I want you to offer them some of the rat.  Some rat.  Okay, horrific. 
[02:03:30]  All right.  Also...  Can you do that for us?  Knock on the door and everything?  Okay.  Of course.  Cool.  Also, since Psycho Mark's in the studio, there is an email directed towards him.  Psycho Mark, which is worse, the smell of fried rat or the feel of man junk in your blindfolded  hand?  I don't know.  Gee, let me have to think that one out for five.  Cool.  A lot of people calling us pussies.  Well, you know what?  Then call me a pussy, man.  You should see Gorilla Boy, the judo expert with the arms that are bigger than my goddamn thighs.  And he's whimpering in the corner like a little schoolgirl at this point. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Come here.  I'll put you on a...  Look at his eyes.  They're all watery, man.  You're ready to go.  I never smelled nothing like...  I never smelled nothing like that.  I can't get the shivery, heebie-jeebie thing.  You know like when you do a shot?  You go like...  You get like the shakes?  That's how I feel.  Only like nauseous, too.  I'd rather sniff Star Jones' sweaty pants.  You know what we should do?  We should make tapes of this broadcast and sell it as a weight loss program. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Really?  I defy you to eat.  Really?  Yeah.  You want to stuff your mouth with ho-hos, you put the ONA weight loss tape on.  You won't freaking eat ever again.  I'm not going to eat all weekend.  Screw tonight.  I'm not eating all weekend.  If they just came in with rat meat cooked, like White Castle, it wouldn't bother me.  That would be bad enough.  But to see the guys...  Wait, get Butchie in here from the Radio Chick Show.  Butchie, come in here.  Because he's just losing out there, too.  Butchie was hanging...  Butchie is the only mic that works right now.  Butchie was hanging with me, man. 
[02:05:00]  Butchie, what's going through your mind right now?  You know, I'm not too squeamish, to be honest with you guys.  That's what Ant and I said.  We could take a lot, but today, forget it.  When he put the thing in his mouth, that was...  And now the scent...  You know, we were just saying, yeah, it could be beef, it could be chicken, but just knowing that...  It's rat.  You're smelling rat.  Yeah.  That's what's bad about it.  All right, hold on.  Okay, hold on, Anthony.  It's going to get a little more interesting.  Oh, God!  All right, hold on.  We've got to get charged.  I didn't curse.  Don't curse.  I didn't curse.  I didn't curse.  Look, look. 
[02:05:30]  He just brought in the plate with the prepared rat.  It's rat on some kind of...  What are they, croutons?  They're croutons.  On croutons, a little, like, sliced bread.  Sliced tomatoes.  Sliced tomato and rat meat.  Oh, what kind of...  Oh, my God.  What kind of sauce is that, black pepper sauce?  Peppercorn.  Peppercorn sauce, and it's got, like, tomato rosettes.  So we've got to have a little bit of that thing.  What do you call your dish, French chef?  The Sammy the Bold Gravano.  Should that be good?  What do you call it? 
[02:06:00]  What do you call it?  Rat toast.  Yeah.  Rat ravioli.  Rat toast.  Rat toast.  It's rat toast.  Yeah.  O'poil.  You want to win?  O'poil.  Oh, O'poil.  I love steak O'poil.  Exactly.  It's fantastic.  Wait, wait.  Get a little side dish so you can bring it into Donna Mike's studio before we start eating  this.  I'm guessing maybe I should go there and give it to him.  All right.  What do you want to go in there now with, uh, here, we've got to wire Mark so we can get  this on the radio.  Yeah, because we've got to be able to hear what's going on.  What's the matter, Henry? 
[02:06:30]  You want a foot?  What about a hook?  You want a wing?  What's the matter, Henry?  Huh?  All right.  Uh, French chef, just, uh, oh my God.  I got to, uh, I got to take a look at this.  Just get it closer.  No, don't come too close because I swear I will barf.  Oh, so I won't bite me.  This is no bit anymore.  Ah.  Wait, come on a little closer.  Just a little, little, little, little, little.  Dude, look at it.  That is so bad.  Look at it.  Oh my God.  That is so bad.  Oh, man.  I must say, if it was like, let's say, steak?  Yeah.  It would look very good. 
[02:07:00]  It would look very good.  That's all I'm going to say.  No, it's rat.  You can't get over it.  And the smell is just horrific.  You got to pick up these beautifully carved tomatoes, these fruit.  Yeah, it's very nicely.  Lemon shaved like a slug.  He's presented it very nicely.  And rat.  All right, Ben, get, get the guys that are going to eat the rat ready.  We're going to bring them in the studio in a minute here.  Oh my God.  Okay.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Oh no.  Don't stop doing that.  Don't do that. 
[02:07:30]  Don't do this.  What happened?  Dude, he's sticking his nose in the rat.  Now I feel obligated that I got to get me.  I got to crack him in the head with a freaking handle.  Is this on?  Uh, Psycho Mark.  Yeah, that is Mark.  Testicles, testicles.  Oh, I've got a piece.  Do you have enough, uh, mic cord?  Yeah, I've got plenty.  All right, listen.  This is what you're going to do.  Jesus.  Let me explain what's going on before we bring the guys in to eat the rat.  Uh, we want to, uh, welcome Donna Mike, uh, to New York.  They're broadcasting live.  Again.  Studio B.  Studio B.  Of our broadcast facility.  They're on tape delay starting at seven.  Uh, we figured that we would bring in a plate of rat to welcome them to New York. 
[02:08:00]  So Psycho Mark's got the microphone.  You got enough cord, right?  Yeah, fine.  All right, listen.  We're not going to be able to hear, so you're going to have to use that mic and, you know,  get the room sound and everything.  Get the room sound and stuff.  Don't rely on their mics because we won't hear anything.  All right, here we go.  You're the only live mic.  All right, Psycho Mark, explain what's going on.  All right, I'm walking over right now.  We're right outside the door, and I'm about to enter the Don and Mike studio.  Okay.  And, uh, are we all set?  We're ready with the rat?  Jesus Christ.  All right, here we go.  I don't know.  Should we check with him or just walk right in?  No, walk right in.  All right, here we go.  Man, you get cool. 
[02:08:30]  Knock.  All right, they're doing a bit.  They're doing a bit.  Sorry.  Sorry to interrupt.  I step out of the room, man.  Grazie.  Middle abito.  Uh-oh.  Okay, see you.  All right, they're doing some weird little bit.  What happened?  Hey, guys.  Wait a minute.  We've been invaded here for a second.  All right, we've been invaded.  All right, here, you want to take this?  There, there you go.  Sure.  Hi.  Howdy, boys.  Howdy, boys.  Hey. 
[02:09:00]  I know what, I've heard about what you boys are up to today.  We are cooking some nice, smoky New York rat today.  We are a survivor series, and we thought we'd share with you some delicious rats.  Not a frigging chance.  If we're doing this right now, we have one man who will do this.  This is right.  He will not eat.  Come on, Rob.  Hey, where's?  Get Spiwack.  Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.  Come on, Rob.  Eat the rat.  All right, eat the rat.  But I don't think my nutritionist would approve.  All right, Rob is going to eat.  He's going to eat the rat?  This is what we'll eat, rat. 
[02:09:30]  We got Rob Spiwack ready to eat.  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  Oh, that was the crunch of the rat.  How does it taste, Rob?  How does it taste?  It tastes like chicken.  All right, you guys are great sports.  Oh, my God.  Rob Spiwack just ate rat.  Rob ate the rat?  It tastes like chicken.  Did he cringe or anything?  He ate it.  Did he cringe?  No, he actually enjoyed it.  He looked like he was just sitting down for tea. 
[02:10:00]  You know why?  He didn't see the whole procedure.  He's very, very lucky.  So it just looks like some type of meat.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, let's, let's, let's, is that mic working too?  We got all the mics working in the studio or?  All right.  You want to take a quick break and then we'll get, all right, that's what we have to do.  Ant, this is what's going on.  I'm going to vomit.  I dare you to turn off the radio now.  I'm going to puke, I swear.  The rat has been prepared.  What happened to the Jeffrey Dahmer chef?  Jeffrey is in the process of cooking his meat now.  All right.  Taking a while, huh? 
[02:10:30]  Used to be his cousin.  All right, Ant, we'll take a very quick break here.  Yeah, please.  When we come back, the French chef who prepared his dish very nicely.  Yes.  He's ready to go.  We got the six to eight of our listeners that will be trying the rat.  And the Jeffrey Dahmer dish, I can only imagine what that's going to look like.  We'll check in with him next as well.  So, right after these listeners eat rat.  Powered by Opie and Anthony.  Owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 102.7 WNEW New New York. 
[02:11:00]  Data catch.  All right, Anthony, we're back.  Yeah.  What a day.  What a day.  What a day.  See, Andrew on line one says if the rat smells bad, then it's not cooked right.  No, it doesn't smell bad.  It smells like cooking meat.  But the fact that I know that it is indeed rat has me a little flustered and a little queasy. 
[02:11:30]  I'll tell you what's going on here.  When you're at a barbecue and you smell like chicken burning, you're like, oh, that's chicken burning.  Yeah.  They put a little steak on the grill.  Oh, wow, steak.  Can't wait to have some.  Yeah.  I've never smelled that smell before.  Rat.  That's rat cooking.  That is what the problem is.  Does it?  I mean, it's a smell that I've never smelled before. 
[02:12:00]  Oh.  It's not like the smell of a rotting rat.  It's just the smell of a rat cooking that we're not used to smelling.  Jeff Norris is going to lose it.  Now, just a minute.  We all have side bets who's going to lose it first.  I almost lost it during commercials.  Ben, without a doubt, if he walks out of the studio again, we'll barf it.  Just imagine a big, fat, greasy rat served up in a dirty ashtray.  All right, well, let's get this, let's get to this. 
[02:12:30]  Look at Spaz, looks like a zombie.  Spaz, you are really pale.  You okay?  Spaz, grab a mic.  Look at me.  He's totally white.  You guys don't understand.  He's whiter than he usually is.  I will not eat for the rest of the weekend.  Spaz, what's up, man?  Okay.  He doesn't feel good.  Get over there.  Get over there.  He's all white.  He's even canned before.  Look how white he is.  Pick up that mic.  You okay? 
[02:13:00]  You're weak and queasy.  Yeah.  I kind of feel queasy and stuff and weak.  I know what he means.  No, he's got like a green, like, tint to him.  Yeah.  You're really pale.  Spaz, you want to try to, you know, maybe you should puke?  Here, get him a pale.  Take care of our buddy.  Spaz, you know how to get rid of it?  Just take a deep breath of that nice rat-cooking smell.  Ah, breathe deep.  The pal's to your right.  Imagine, imagine stuffing so much rat meat in your mouth that it starts getting in the  back of your throat like when you're gagging on your toothbrush or something. 
[02:13:30]  Wow, look at him.  Hey, look at him.  Big, big.  Get the bucket under him.  Get the bucket under him.  Big, big chunk of fatty rat meat.  Mm-mm.  Ew.  All right, get out of here.  Take the bucket and get out of here.  Go, go, go.  Get out of the studio.  No, go, go, go.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Oh, my God.  Take her.  I think, uh... 
[02:14:00]  I think Spaz is ralphing.  I almost made myself cute.  So many people online calling us pussies.  Whatever.  You can call me whatever you want today.  I don't give up.  Rat's ass.  Who's eating rat ass?  All right, let's, uh, let's, let's, yeah, let's, are all the mics working so I know?  Take it easy, Jeff.  Did you shake that guy's hand or touch him in any way? 
[02:14:30]  No, see, you know something?  No, no, wait a minute.  I'm sorry.  It's nothing personal.  I'm not touching anybody.  I'm not touching anybody.  No, no, no, Jeff.  Jeff, thank you.  Thanks, Drew.  It's not personal because if Opie came over and wanted to shake my hand, I wouldn't.  I'm not touching anybody or anything at this point right now.  Now, yes, no.  No, no, no, no.  Never.  Jeff Norris appearing Sunday at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey.  Go see Gorilla Boy.  You're playing with Bob Nelson?  Yeah.  Okay, terrific. 
[02:15:00]  Okay, terrific.  I'm being nice.  He's good.  Has he written a new joke in 10 years?  Oh, I'm just kidding.  Bob Nelson is great.  I love that football.  I love that football gag he does.  Okay.  Oh, look at Jeff.  It's not you saying it.  Bob Nelson.  Right on.  Go see Jeff Norris and Bob Nelson.  Should he still do that?  Does he do the football guy?  I believe he does.  It's the first time I've ever worked on him.  The last. 
[02:15:30]  Are you kidding me?  He still does the football guy?  Yeah.  Wow.  No, but it's a good thing.  I guess it's a classic.  It is a classic.  It's a classic.  It's like Archie Bunker.  He's classic.  All right.  I think.  So right when he says, you know, you can get seriously killed, like everyone laughs  like it's the first time they ever heard it?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Thanks, fellas.  Enjoy the rat.  Jeff Norris, everyone.  All right, Rick.  What do we got going on?  You're, you're, uh, I think you're the most sane one around here right now.  All right.  Um, everybody's pretty much itching to get some, some rat meat in. 
[02:16:00]  I can't take it.  And the, uh, and Jeffrey Dahmer is done cooking.  All right.  Why don't we get the two chefs on mic three?  Let's get them in first.  I would starve if I was, uh, if I was stranded somewhere and had to eat like rat.  I would just starve.  I'd be dead.  Bye.  Goodbye.  How did those people from the, the soccer team in the Andes that crashed, the live,  how did they eat each other?  Like, it's a rat.  Imagine doing it to people.  No, it's got to be over there somehow, some way.  I don't care what mic works, what doesn't work.  Talk into the air. 
[02:16:30]  It's got to be away from me or I will vomit.  All right.  There's a, there's a drastic difference between, uh, the chef's, um, work of art, Anthony.  Yeah.  Um, the French chef, he, he, he really, uh, took his time to prepare a very nice dish, Anthony,  with the rat.  But, uh, Jeffrey Dahmer also took a lot of time to prepare, uh, what do you, what do you call  that?  Lemon basil rat.  Lemon basil rat.  Can I, can I see it just lifted up and tilted toward, you don't know, you don't have to come  over.  Okay.  Oh my God. 
[02:17:00]  It tastes wonderful.  By the way, we got, uh, an S loaded video.  I ate it.  It was delicious.  Okay.  It's all right.  Um, okay.  I guess we're ready.  I guess we'll bring the listeners in and they'll, and they'll decide which one they want  to try, right?  Is that the way to do it?  Maybe they could try both and, uh, and, uh, vote who's the best.  Who's the best one?  Like in Ready, Set, Cook, Opie.  You, you got, you want to do that?  Yeah.  Are you guys willing to try both, uh, dishes?  No.  No?  No.  Yeah, these guys. 
[02:17:30]  Fine.  No.  You saw the side we picked.  Opie, I am.  You saw the side we picked.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We want to talk to all you guys.  You got to talk one at a time though.  Okay?  The funny thing is that when this whole process started, way before they saw what happened  to the rat and everything, they were all gung-ho and now look at them.  They're all like, get me the hell out of here.  No, no.  It's not that.  We all want to eat it.  It's just that we're kind of, we're Jeffrey Dahmer kind of scared us in the process.  The Jeffrey Dahmer cook.  Yeah.  Kabuki.  He would have told us what's going on with how he's preparing it. 
[02:18:00]  All right.  Well, we got, uh, we have six of you guys eating it.  Matt, Ben, Mike, Brian, April, and another Brian.  Is that true?  That's right.  All right.  Who wants to go first?  How about this?  I'll eat a piece before any of you guys.  I cooked it.  I'll eat a piece before you.  All right.  Jeffrey Dahmer, the chef.  Why don't you, uh, why don't you eat a piece of your energy or eat a piece of rat?  Here we go.  All right.  Here is.  This is from the rib cage.  Okay.  It's a very delicate piece of meat.  It's tender.  It's wonderful.  Are you ready?  All right.  I'm sorry.  Oh, B. 
[02:18:30]  That's my.  Oh, my God.  He's chewing it.  It's delicious.  It's delicious.  It's a high-scale old dirty dinner.  Oh, my God.  It's tender.  It's like a chicken cockpit.  What does it taste like?  Um, like rat.  It doesn't taste like chicken, right?  No, actually, it tastes like my old friend that, no, I'm just kidding.  No, seriously.  You had to equate it to a meat.  It tastes like lemon and basil.  What does it taste like?  But there's no meat that it's similar to in texture or taste or chicken.  I would say chicken.  Get out of here.  Chicken. 
[02:19:00]  No, no, actually, no, beef.  Because it's more stringier than beef.  All right.  It's stringy?  It's good.  You want to see?  No.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  Just swallow the damn piece.  It's done.  Swallowed.  Delicious.  You know the rag that you have on your shoulder has rat blood on it, right?  Yes.  Thank you.  I just wanted to point that out.  Okay.  So you brought on meat?  No, no.  There's a drastic difference between the two chefs here.  Two styles, yeah.  The Jeffrey Dahmer chef, blood all over his uniform, and he had blood all around his mouth 
[02:19:30]  when he put the rat's head in his mouth.  You ever see Motel Hell?  Takes all kinds of critters to make Farmer Johnson fritters.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what he seems like.  He seems like the cookout of, like, he used a chainsaw.  All right.  Let's, uh.  Not at all.  I use a knife.  Do we have pails for the guys, just in case?  There should be a bucket nearby.  They can use my hat.  Got them.  All right.  Woof.  Can we compare?  All right.  Why don't we.  Yeah, we were hoping you two would compare and maybe vote what your best rat dish is.  We can do that.  Yeah, we need. 
[02:20:00]  No person, to be fair.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We need a lot of you guys to try both dishes and decide which is better.  Then we have to clear the palate with some whores.  Yeah, which is.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  Terrific.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's have one at a time.  Okay.  Terrific.  One at a time.  Who's.  Wait.  What's your name, dude?  Mike.  Mike.  Wait.  Get our Mike.  Oh, sorry, man.  Okay.  We want to give you a little credit.  Where are you from?  You know, a little.  I think we talked earlier.  I'm from Mayapac.  Yeah, okay.  You're the Mayapac guy.  Yeah, right.  And I'm licking my face.  And I totally dig you guys from Boston, by the way. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, hey, Boston.  Right on.  This is the type of stuff that got us kicked out of Boston.  So.  Great.  All right.  So Mike's got the French chef's rat dish.  And he's eating it.  He's chewing it.  What do you think?  Very nice.  What does it taste like?  What does it taste like?  Filet mignon.  Is it good?  No, for real.  I really want to give you an honest opinion.  I'm not a food connoisseur, but it's really not that different from beef.  Beef?  Yeah, absolutely.  Okay.  All right.  Like maybe, um. 
[02:21:00]  Like Chang's food beef?  You know, because he's got it with the tomato and whatever it is that gives the flavor.  But I don't know food, but it's not chicken.  That's for sure.  Okay.  More of a beef.  All right.  You want to try Jeffrey Dahmer's dish?  Yeah.  You know what?  I'll be a little hesitant, but I'll take it just to be fair.  All right.  You got to decide which one you like.  Don't, don't, don't vote.  Just take a piece of beef.  Don't tell, uh, tell the listeners which one you like better.  Okay.  Fair enough.  All right.  Here comes, uh, Mike.  Where did Ant go?  He's hiding in the corner. 
[02:21:30]  I'm getting it.  You know what?  Opie, I just want to point out that I got a piece of Jeffrey Dahmer's in my hand, and  I do have a hair.  Oh, God.  So I want to know about the hair first.  That needs some Moujons.  And I still, you know, I'm pulling the hair.  Anybody got some tweezers?  Maybe I can't grab it.  There is hair.  I see it from here.  You saw that, right?  All right.  Go ahead, Mike.  All right.  He's chewing the other one.  Swallow it with that.  You need a tracer.  What do you think?  What's he looking for? 
[02:22:00]  My back.  Did you just spit it out?  I just spit.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Okay.  He obviously didn't like, uh, boy, guess which dish he liked better.  What happened there?  Oh, he's puking.  Is he puking?  Is he puking?  Get that on video.  It shut him up.  He just walked away from the microphone.  He walked away and put his head in a bucket. 
[02:22:30]  What's going on over there, Rick?  I'm okay.  He's all right?  All right.  He's fighting it back.  He's fighting, dude.  He's slumped over the garbage.  I would love.  I guess we're going to have to wait and see why there was a problem with Jeffrey Dahmer's  version of the rat.  I don't think he's ready to talk.  He's going to be a little white.  Let us know what's going on.  Let's get the next time.  He's looking so close to throwing up.  I got to tell you.  All right.  What's your name, buddy?  There's a stage where you just, like, get gagging.  Yeah.  And you're on the verge of just absolutely losing.  That's where I am. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, my God.  What happened there?  He's just.  What was that?  What happened there?  That's going to start a chain reaction.  He just puked.  He just puked.  Wait a second.  Look, I'm really feeling queasy.  I'm really feeling queasy.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, fellas.  Dude, I'm moving around like King Gimp right now. 
[02:23:30]  Look at him.  He's over here in the corner.  Yeah, look.  I am in the corner, and there's a reason for that.  And also, I want to tell everybody right now, I love you guys.  Thank you for coming down.  But I swear to Christ, I am not shaking anyone's hand.  There would be no patting on the back.  There would be nothing.  No contact whatsoever.  I want to be in a plastic bubble right now.  And the next time we see you guys out in public, just make believe you don't even know us.  No problem.  Or say you're on the show checking out strippers or something. 
[02:24:00]  Just never, ever bring up the rat thing ever, ever again.  Okay.  So let's get a vote here, because one guy has finished both, the French chef.  He ate it and said it tasted like beef, not too much different than beef.  The tomato added a nice flavor to it.  And the Jeffrey Dahmer dish, he vomited.  All right.  Well, let's ask Mike.  Mike, he's done from doing his thing.  What does Jeffrey Dahmer's rat taste like?  Like I said, I really, really wanted to be fair about this dude, but that sucks. 
[02:24:30]  What did it taste like?  Ass.  And you know what?  That was better than that stuff.  Man's ass?  I might well, because of that.  Is that what it is?  That's the only reason why I might consider a man's ass right there.  No problem.  Hold on.  Watch the cursing.  All right.  Jeffrey Dahmer getting a little upset about his dance.  He says, I'm not upset at all.  He goes, good, then I'll eat the effing rat.  I'm not upset at all.  I'll eat the rat.  I'll eat the rat.  And then I'll cut your head off and stuff you in a barrel. 
[02:25:00]  Can I make a prediction here?  I'm not a clairvoyant, but there's, what, six of us?  Two, four, six, seven.  Who ate?  Seven of us.  You did.  By the way, shh, shh.  Seven of us are here to eat.  Yeah.  And I see, you know, there's six more left of French guys and a pile full of whatever over there.  Yeah.  And I can guarantee you that at least four of the seven, more than 50%, will have the feeling 
[02:25:30]  and at least, at least, at the very minimum, be nauseous at the taste of the ass.  Oh, my.  All right.  Well.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  Now, Jeffrey Dahmer, we got to be, you know, be calm, be cool.  It's one man's opinion.  I'm fine.  Yeah, well, how about the next guy step up and...  Wait, you don't have any weapons on you right now, right?  No, just...  Just a rat tail.  Okay, very good.  All right, who's next to try the rat?  I guess I am.  All right.  What's your name, buddy?  Brian from Jersey. 
[02:26:00]  Hey, Brian.  Representing Jersey.  Are you ready for this?  Are you as psyched as you were like an hour and a half ago?  Absolutely.  Okay.  Anthony Bryant from Jersey.  Ah, wonderful.  You know, I'd rather go with the French guy last, but since he's standing here...  All right.  All right.  He's eating the rat prepared by the French chef.  Holy shit.  He is chewing.  He's chewing.  His face is...  He's looking.  He's like, you know, taking it for all it's worth.  He's doing okay. 
[02:26:30]  He's doing okay.  You know, it's the bread.  A little swallow.  It's the bread.  Yeah, the bread is a good part of it.  A little bit of tomato.  What's the spices on there?  It's pepper sauce.  Pepper sauce.  Pepper sauce.  Au poivre.  All right.  What do you think, Brian?  I think it's better than the stuff that they stand on the streets with.  Okay.  I don't think he had a problem with the French chef.  He liked the French...  And what would you equate it with?  What type of meat?  Those little skewers that, you know, you get at a mall when they're standing there.  Yeah.  Like that kind of...  Yeah.  Almost like...  You know, you're not really sure what... 
[02:27:00]  What kind of meat it is, but it's supposed to be some kind of meat.  I got you.  Okay.  All right.  History meat.  Brian, are you brave enough to try Jeffrey Darman?  All right.  Let him clean his palate with a little water or something.  Wine.  A little wine.  Oh, yes.  Wine.  Of course.  We forgot about the wine.  The wine for the listeners.  We don't have a spoon or anything.  I got to dig my hand in that mess.  We do have pictures of the two dishes, right?  Because you guys are going to laugh when you see the difference on the website.  What do you suggest here, Chef?  This big hunk of bone or... 
[02:27:30]  Well, that's a thigh.  That's the rat thigh.  If you're so brave...  I'm going to be the lucky one to take this big hunk.  Jeffrey Darman's getting pissed.  There's a bone in there.  All right.  Don't get pissed.  Not at all.  Watch out.  There's a bone in there.  Whoa, that's a huge piece.  That's a big piece.  I would suggest I eat this.  I would go like this.  It's a chicken wing.  Okay.  Yeah.  Just like a chicken junk steak.  Wait, he's got to pull the meat off a bone?  Yeah, sure.  All right, Brian.  All right.  Can I take an onion or anything with this?  There's onions on the plate. 
[02:28:00]  There you go.  Whatever you got.  Watch, your bib is falling down.  Yeah, you're going to need that bib.  Here he goes.  Okay.  He's got the bone in his mouth.  He's stripping...  He's stripping...  He's stripping like a chicken wing, Anthony.  God damn it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He can't get the bone out.  He can't get the bone out.  He's just into it.  All right.  What do you think?  This one's a little fatty.  And I'm concerned about my body and all. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, that looks rare.  Hey, stop.  Uh-oh.  It may be bleeding.  Oh, it is bleeding.  Oh, my God.  Fuck, man.  Okay.  Hold the frigging bone.  Maybe that could have been cooked a little better.  You know when you get away?  Maybe.  You know when you get a wing, Anthony, that wasn't cooked enough and you get near the bone and the meat's a little raw?  Not listening to you.  That's what happened with Brian.  I am not listening. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  Opie, by the way, the bone breaks off when he's trying to pull it out from your teeth.  Thank you, Brian.  All right.  So what do you think, Brian, of Jeffrey's dish?  Um, I didn't order medium rare.  Yeah.  I would definitely go with the French guy's bread.  How did his taste?  How did Jeffrey Dahmer say?  But you're not like dry heaving.  Are you like an ex-Marine or something?  There's a few of you guys here.  No, no.  No, okay.  Two down.  Um, you were, Mike, you were an ex-Marine?  I was in the Army and I ate bugs and that stuff is bad. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, we got USMC right over here.  That would be me.  Yeah, cool.  So, Brian, you're not going to have an opinion on that?  No dry heaving?  Nothing?  You're okay?  No, not at the moment.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, let's move on to the next part.  He liked the French chefs also.  All right, Anthony, we got a lovely young lady in the studio.  Well, it's for the French chef.  This would be April, right?  Yes, April.  Hi, April.  Where are you calling from?  Hi.  Oh, calling from.  I've lost it.  Well, right now I'm calling from the studio. 
[02:30:00]  I'm sorry.  Where are you from?  I reside on Long Island, but I'm originally from Virginia.  Okay.  What part of Long Island?  Vagina.  No, Virginia.  Now I'm out in Mastic now.  Okay, really good.  Way at ease.  A lovely lady ready to try the French chef's rat dish.  I can't believe you're brave enough to do that.  All right, French chef.  Here she goes.  Don't drop any rat.  Here it goes.  Okay, let her rip.  Putting it in her mouth.  In her mouth.  And she's chewing.  She's chewing.  She's chewing.  Oh, God. 
[02:30:30]  She's chewing.  Her face isn't bad.  Her face isn't bad.  She's like, oh, it's good.  Good.  She likes it.  Hey, Mikey.  What does it taste like, April?  Yeah, I'd say beef.  Yeah.  Beef.  Yeah.  Like a lot of people saying beef.  Like good beef.  Yeah.  It's cooked well.  Pretty tender.  Yeah.  Are you brave enough to take the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge?  Oh.  The Jeffrey Dahmer challenge, huh?  I guess I have to. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Well, it's the only way to really be fair.  Yeah.  It's like a fraternity in here.  I mean, whoever doesn't do the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge is going to be a whiff.  Take the smallest piece.  So is this like Survivor?  We get to vote someone out?  Take that little piece right there.  Yeah.  Whoever doesn't do the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge gets voted out.  Whoever gets the most pukes gets voted out.  All right.  She's got a piece of the Jeffrey Dahmer dish.  She's already cringing.  She's got it in her mouth.  She is making some weird faces.  She's okay.  What do you think?  What do you think?  What do you think?  Remember what did that look like? 
[02:31:30]  Edible.  It's edible.  Okay.  That's a start.  It's chewy, though.  Chewy.  Not as flavorful.  I like the French guys better.  Ah.  The French chef.  Three.  And Jeffrey Dahmer.  Oh.  So fun.  I have to be fair to him.  It's okay.  It's not bad?  Yeah.  It's not bad.  Mike, you might have got, like, the rat ass or something.  I did, but I'm still three for three.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  No, I didn't get the rat ass.  The rat ass is on the table outside.  Yeah.  It was in his mouth earlier. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, God.  All right, April.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You did a very good job, Anthony.  Thank you for being from there.  All right.  Who's next?  Brian from Brooklyn.  Hi, Brian.  How are you?  Good.  Very good.  Are you ready for this, Brian?  You're psyched.  He's psyched to eat some rat.  All right.  He's got the French chef's rat dish.  The French guy's got a much better presentation.  Ah, see, the French guy winning on presentation.  I think everyone will agree with that.  Yeah, he's got, like, the little flowers made out of tomato skin.  Little crackers.  Yeah.  Oh, he just dribbled.  Oh, he dropped the little rat. 
[02:32:30]  Dribbled a little rat on you.  In my defense, I worked today, and I jumped in a cab to run over the head.  It's okay.  You don't have to defend yourself.  It's rat, for Christ's sake.  I mean, and the cabbie's dead.  That's good rat.  That's good rat?  It's good.  The French chef gets another vote.  What does it taste like?  It's, like, a lot like beef.  It really is.  A lot like beef.  It's got a different flavor to it.  Everyone is saying that the French chef's version of rat tastes a lot like beef.  It's flavorful, tender, and good. 
[02:33:00]  Look at that.  It's enjoyable to eat.  Yeah.  It's got a lot of flavor.  The French chef's rat.  All right.  Now, cleanse your palate and go over to the Jeffrey Dahmer version of rat.  No, we're just calling up the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge at this point.  Jeffrey Dahmer.  He's prepared to take the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge.  He's bringing up the small plate.  No, there's no rat on that plate.  Yeah.  There's no onion.  That's just onion.  How could he tell?  Really?  All right.  He's grabbing.  There's a big piece.  You want to see it?  Oh, it's dripping.  Yeah.  You're going for a big piece, Brian? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  I think it looks like a leg.  That's a rib meat.  That's a rib?  Oh.  That's a rib meat.  That's good stuff.  Rat rib meat.  He's got it in his mouth.  All right.  He's making some.  He's doing okay.  Excuse me for talking to my mouth.  It's okay.  Excuse me for talking to my mouth.  It's, uh, how do you feel about Jeffrey Dahmer's?  It's not bad.  Not bad?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's better.  I'd eat either.  You'd eat either?  A tie?  Is there a tie?  You've got to, like, decide on one of them. 
[02:34:00]  Well, I've got to, well, it goes down smooth.  I'd go with the friendship.  Yeah, the presentation.  Uh, Chef Dahmer's is pretty good.  Chef Jeff.  My hat's off to you.  Thank you.  French chef, I give it to you also.  All right.  Anthony, what?  Four.  You know what?  For the French chef.  Hold on.  And Jeffrey Dahmer.  You know what that's like?  Huh?  That's like when you go to, like, the strip club.  Yeah.  And there's the really ugly girl, and you give her the, like, the, I care for you because  you've really fed dollar. 
[02:34:30]  Hey, we've all been, man.  That's good.  We gave you the courtesy dollar is what we did.  I guess they gave that to you.  We had no choice but to give you the courtesy dollar.  I guess they gave that to you.  All right.  Mike and, and this, I guess they gave that to you.  Mike and Jeffrey Dahmer, definitely, easy, easy.  They definitely have a problem with each other.  No problem.  No problem.  No problem.  No problem.  We're all friends here.  Jeffrey Dahmer taking it very personally.  It's just the blood on it.  It's the blood on your shoulder that I have a problem with.  No, it's the blood on your head.  Oh, okay, all right.  He just put the bloody rag on his head. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Okay, who's next?  It's all good.  It's all good, brother.  All right, it's all good, all right.  We got three to go, Anthony.  Who's up next?  Jamie.  Jamie?  Yep.  Hi, Jamie.  Where are you calling?  I keep saying where are you from?  Connecticut.  All right, good.  He's got the French chef's rat.  I've lost consciousness at this point.  All right, he's got the French chef's rat in his mouth, Anthony.  Jamie from Connecticut.  He's got a bone.  He's chilling. 
[02:35:30]  He's got a bone.  You can hear it.  Oh, that's not a good thing.  That's not a good thing.  He's crunching the bone in his mouth, Anthony.  It's crust.  It's not a bone.  Oh, it's crust?  Okay.  It's good.  It's good?  You like it?  Beefy?  Yep.  Beefy.  You like to try some without a bone?  It didn't have a bone in his crust.  No, we'll give you the bone after.  All right, Jamie likes the French chef's...  All right, now, Jamie, you ready to take the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge?  I guess I might have to.  Okay.  I guess I might have to. 
[02:36:00]  All right, so Jamie from Connecticut has a piece of Jeffrey Dahmer's rat,  and he's putting it in his mouth.  He's chewing.  He's chewing.  He's licking his fingers.  He's finger-licking good.  It's not horrible.  It's not horrible.  I like the spice on the French guys better, though.  Yeah, the pepper sauce, yes.  Au plop.  I'm going for the French guy.  Going for the French guy.  All right, French guy.  All right.  Five. 
[02:36:30]  All right.  All right.  Are you guys enjoying the wine and stuff that that other guy brought there?  Definitely.  What wine?  Is the wine going well with the rat?  Yeah, wine goes well with rat?  That type of wine?  Sure.  Yeah.  Are we finished with people eating rat?  No.  Why?  No, we still have...  Okay.  Why?  No, I wanted to finish the dish.  Because he doesn't want to go well for seven.  What do you mean finish the...  What do you mean...  What do you mean finish the dish?  No, I was going to eat it.  Oh, eat the rest of it? 
[02:37:00]  All right.  Who's up next?  I'm Matt.  Hi, Matt.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Where are you from?  I'm from Jersey as well.  All right.  Very good.  I'm the ex-Marine.  I've done this before.  You've done this before?  Not with spices.  That's the only difference.  You've eaten just cooked rat?  On a bet.  On a bet?  Yeah.  Did you puke?  No.  How was it prepared?  Burnt.  Just burnt?  Burnt over fire?  Oh, my God.  That's the way to do it.  Hummelite.  French post-bettic barbecue.  All right.  Let's see how he does.  He's trying the French first. 
[02:37:30]  He's going to have no problem with this.  That's obvious.  This is fun.  This is fun.  Hoorah.  He's chewing.  Semper Fi.  Semper Fi.  Yeah.  All right.  He had no problem with that.  There he goes.  Now he's going to go for the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge.  Well, he's got a swallow, though.  It's a little Brazil.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Improvise.  Adapt.  Overcome.  I'd like to kill that myself. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, right?  I like, you know, biting the throats out of him first.  All right.  He's getting a piece of...  Taking the Jeffrey Dahmer challenge.  Yes.  Unidentifiable piece.  Yeah, really?  With fat.  It's right by the ass and the balls.  It's right next to the yam bag.  It's right next to the yam bag.  It's very tender.  It's delicious.  It's right next to the yam bag.  Okay.  I'm thoroughly convinced.  It's a very delicious...  The chef who was supposed to appear is lying dead on a subway platform somewhere. 
[02:38:30]  And who is he?  Your brother?  He snuck by Bellevue somewhere and grabbed the whites on the way out the door.  Sure I did.  All right.  Sure I did, but I got your identity.  So he's eating pretty much rat yam bag right now, Anthony.  Cold enough, anyway.  A little bone.  That might be the ass piece.  Oh, God.  I can't watch it.  That was an ass bone.  But in all honesty...  Yeah.  Yeah?  Not bad.  Pretty good?  It's a little salty, but it does have some flavor to it. 
[02:39:00]  Salty?  Salty could be from the blood.  I'm not sure.  No, that was the rat sweating before I cut his throat.  Oh, God.  This Jeffrey Dahmer guy.  All in all, it's not that bad.  But I do give it to the French.  But a lot of people...  A lot of people...  No animosity.  It is very good, though.  No animosity.  I appreciate it.  He's ready to explode, man.  We will see him on America's Most Wanted this weekend, Saturday.  Absolutely.  Anthony, what is the total at this point?  This is wonderful.  The French chef?  Thank you very much.  Six.  Okay. 
[02:39:30]  Jeffrey Dahmer.  We have our final rat eater, Anthony.  There, thank God.  The sooner we get past this, the better.  All right.  Tequila.  Oh, yeah.  We got some Cabo Wabo tequila.  I would like to take you to this.  Is that possible?  Yeah, hold on.  We got the last rat eater.  Last rat eater.  What's your name, man?  Ben.  Hi, Ben.  Connecticut.  Ben, how ironic.  Here we go. 
[02:40:00]  He's chewing the French chef's dish.  Yeah, that was pretty good, man.  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, it was just like beef, like everybody was saying.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't expecting people to say it tastes pretty good.  It was good.  Man.  It was.  All right.  How about the Jeffrey Dahmer Challenge, which has made one of our contestants puke already  today.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Okay. 
[02:40:30]  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  What he just did, Opie, he took the Jeffrey Dahmer plate, the paper plate, full of rat meat  and juices, folded the plate in half, and let it all cascade into his mouth.  Oh, man.  Chasing with the cue.  And he's chasing it with some Cabo Wabo tequila.  He folded the plate, juice, meat, everything went cascading into his mouth.  I got the second plate. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, no.  He's going to do the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Now, the chef is going to try, Jeffrey Dahmer is going to try the French chef's dish.  What do you think?  Which one?  Even though I chugged that plate, I don't know.  The French chef's is better, but the chef from Rikers, his is still good.  Seven.  We're going to taste Mox.  Yeah, it's official.  It's a shutout.  It looks very good.  Jeffrey Dahmer tastes frying the French chef's rat dish. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, my God.  It's crawling around my tongue.  Is it good?  No, no.  Very good.  It's very good.  Security.  Yeah, Mike.  Security.  Mike.  Opie, not for nothing.  Not for nothing.  Not for nothing.  Not for nothing.  Excuse you.  Were you invited?  Excuse you.  All right, you two.  You two, play nice.  Not for nothing.  Yeah.  I was really, you know, this is good.  Giving the benefit of the doubt earlier. 
[02:42:00]  Well, I mean, seven people ago, Opie, that he would only, that I would only go four for  seven.  Right.  Who would have thought that a mere hour or a half hour ago that I was seven for seven on  such a bad dish?  Oh, he's doing the same thing.  You folded the plate and have juice, rat, everything.  Enough with the rat.  I've had it.  I've totally had it at this point.  Opie, can I let you know?  Peter would be happy to know that no rat went to waste today, Anthony. 
[02:42:30]  No, they ate every bit of the rat.  And its pelt will be used as a little purse and its bones will be used for science.  All right.  I want to let you know, Opie, Anthony, thanks for having us down to eat some rat.  No problem, man.  Besides the fact that I ate both dishes and judged it fairly and had some great wine,  I'm about to drink some Cabo Wabo.  Cabo Wabo, the number one drink of the winner and the loser.  That's such good tequila.  Outstanding. 
[02:43:00]  Outstanding.  But honestly.  We're all winners here, fellas.  We're all winners here.  Let's hear it for all the rat eaters today.  We're all winners here.  Wow.  Ponderous.  F-ing ponderous.  We're all winners.  You're all winners is right.  Okay.  Is it on?  All right.  That's great.  Yeah, we're going to.  It was a sweep.  Can we get every bit of rat and rat eating?  I would love the studio just flushed of rat.  Yeah.  No problem.  Still one left. 
[02:43:30]  The show.  I think we got some strippers for you guys for being good sports.  Yeah.  I'll give you a little show out in the lobby lounge.  Get the ladies started and we'll join the party in a minute or two here, okay?  Once again, you guys did a great job with the rat today.  I want to thank the two chefs for coming down today.  I wouldn't plug your business because no one is going to go there.  French chef.  No.  Thank you.  No, no.  We won't talk about that.  French chef, thank you very much.  Jeffrey Dahmer, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Okay, why is he coming near me?  Don't snap my neck. 
[02:44:00]  No, there's no touching.  We don't touch anyone.  No touching.  All right, hold on.  We'll talk off the air.  No touching.  We're in the middle of the road.  I swear, I will.  Thank you.  I was clean.  No, no, no.  There you go.  All right, I'm not touching anybody.  I'm bloody.  We're going to take a break.  We're going to go to the phone and see what everyone is thinking out there.  And we've got some strippers.  And we'll play What Did We Learn?  All that crap.  Stay there.  Okay.  After me.  Their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act. 
[02:44:30]  Ponder.  Kevin Ponder.  1027.  WNEW.  All right, Ant.  The weekend upon us.  A lot of people looking for things to do this weekend.  Did we take the wind out of Survivor's sails by doing this?  I think so.  The whole reason we did this today is because, yeah, our new favorite show on CBS.  CBS, believe it or not.  The first time I'm talking about a show on CBS.  Survivor.  Survivor.  I'm completely hooked.  It's only been on the air two weeks so far.  Next week, they have people eating rats. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  So we decided to, you know, beat them to the punch and have some of our listeners eat rat today.  There's no way on TV, even with pictures, it can be as horrific as what went down here today.  Correct.  They're not going to show them actually hunting down the rats and killing them and cooking them, skinning them, and eating them like that.  Right.  God, am I nauseous.  Well, Ant, enough of that.  Weekend upon us.  People looking for things to do.  So I'm going to go on, before we even start the live read for what we have to do here, I'm going to encourage everyone to go see, I would love to say my favorite comedian, but then the other comedians that are friends of the show will get really pissed off. 
[02:45:30]  So I'll just say he's one of the top five favorite comedians of Opie.  Jeffrey Dahmer, the chef.  No.  No?  Brian Regan.  Oh, Brian Regan.  Yes, of course.  Who had a tough gig today trying to inject some comedy into this show.  Into death.  And he did a great job with it, and I know he's listening.  I want to thank him again for stopping by. 
[02:46:00]  It was a tough gig today.  Yeah.  But he's playing Rascals.  He's playing Ocean Township Rascals tonight for two shows.  I'm telling you, you will laugh your yam bag off.  I promise you that.  And if you don't call me up on Monday and say you didn't laugh, I'll be very surprised.  Yeah.  You'd have to be a Vulcan.  So it's Brian Regan tonight, Ocean Township for two shows, the Rascals Ocean Township.  Or tomorrow night, West Orange Rascals for two shows.  Call Rascals for ticket info.  I'm imagining that the tickets are going fast.  Okay, Ant?  So when you call up and they say they're sold out, sorry, you missed your chance, you're still going to have to do something. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  And there's the segue for Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  That's right.  You want something to do in New York, you go out and you go to the newsstand and you get Time Out New York.  It'll jump right at you.  It's at every newsstand prominently displayed.  It has thousands of things to do.  Get a hold of this week's Time Out New York.  You'll never believe what's happening on the Lower East Side.  Everything from new restaurants to boutiques to galleries.  The issue is chock full of information to get ready for the summer, including a rundown of the best garden, courtyard, and rooftop restaurants. 
[02:47:00]  A complete pull-out calendar of the Central Park Summer Stage concert schedule.  And a roundup of sample sales for stocking up on summer clothes.  I can get some clothes.  For a subscription, give them a call.  1-888-GET-T-O-N-Y.  Time Out New York, the obsessive guide to impulsive entertainment.  1-888-GET-T-O-N-Y.  Get it and get out.  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are really funny and stuff, but you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show. 
[02:47:30]  Go take a mitle.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-A-W.  Man, that sweeper makes sense today, huh?  Hell yeah.  Woo!  And for the record, I want to tell everyone that I have a crush on Sarah Jessica Parker.  She is hot.  I want to thank Sarah Jessica Parker for putting us in our place earlier today on the show. 
[02:48:00]  I like that.  She goes right to the source.  She's got some balls.  That's a story for another day.  If you weren't listening earlier, you missed some more cringe radio.  It was very uncomfortable for you and I.  And critiquing Sarah Jessica Parker's performance on the MTV Movie Awards last night.  And lo and behold.  And I was stupid enough to say that she's starting to look like Ruth Buzzi.  Yeah, you made fun of her looks.  And then next thing you know, line two, Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm like, yeah, whatever. 
[02:48:30]  And we start talking and I'm like, oh my God.  It was Sarah Jessica Parker.  It was Sarah Jessica Parker.  And she was putting us in our place.  Check out the new season of Sex and the City on HBO.  I love it.  And I folded up like an ironing board.  Well, we both did.  I was a big pussy.  She started saying stuff and I was just like, yeah, you're right.  I was trying to save some face.  But I'm like, you know what?  What are you going to do?  You know, she's got balls enough to call up and defend herself to a couple of a-holes like us.  So, whatever.  A little more balls than we do. 
[02:49:00]  And we learned a lot today.  What an educational show this was.  I swear to God, today's show, if you were dialing through the stations and you came across our show,  you would think Nova was now being broadcast on the radio.  Oh, yeah.  This was truly the Discovery Channel today.  We had people eating New York City sewer rats.  Big rats that you have to hold by the tail with your fist.  They were huge. 
[02:49:30]  I know.  I can't stop doing that, too.  You know, Ope just made the face, that face.  I keep doing it.  It's like right here.  I feel queasy.  It is right here.  There's no way of meaning.  I feel motion sick.  Like I've been on a boat or something without any Dramamine.  I feel that kind of like queasy, woozy, weak, flushed feeling.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Jay, what's going on?  O&A.  Did you enjoy the festivities today, Jay? 
[02:50:00]  Today was a great show.  Cool.  I learned that Ope's got a stuttering problem.  Yeah, I do.  If you saw what I saw, you would be stuttering, too.  Not only was I stuttering, I swear I looked just like King Gimp.  I was making these movements.  These movements spasms.  I was just trying to get the nauseous feeling out of my body.  Well, you made it through it, guys.  Thank you, Jay.  Another great show.  All right, man.  Well, Mike C., Ope, from Brooklyn, has a great what he learned today.  What I learned on the Ope and Anthony show, when Ope's nauseous, he keeps asking people, 
[02:50:30]  where are you calling from when they're standing two feet in front of them?  You fag.  Syndication when I get my official O&A Ralph bucket.  All right.  Kathleen, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hey.  Okay, I got two things for you.  Yeah.  First of all, ill.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And second of all, I really got to thank you.  I had, like, the day from hell at work.  It was possibly the worst day of my professional career.  And I was just in the crappiest mood when I got in the car.  You guys had made me laugh so hard.  I hope you didn't vomit. 
[02:51:00]  Oh, no, no, no.  I have a stronger stomach for you guys, apparently.  Yeah.  But it was just, I really got to thank you, because I just really had the worst day.  Everything went wrong today.  Like, you guys are the only ones that put a smile on my face.  The funniest part about the whole show was Brian Regan and trying to interject that comedy  into a really nasty, gnarly situation.  Dude, that's the true test of a real comedian, then.  Yeah, he's great.  I'm telling you.  I'm going tomorrow night.  I can't wait.  I'll say hi to everyone over there.  I wouldn't blame you one bit, man.  That's a talented guy.  You can try and interject. 
[02:51:30]  I mean, that kind of carnage.  Yeah.  Well, Pete from Long Island says it.  He goes, what he learned, he learned that a comedian, fried rats, and strippers can unite  only on the Opie and Anthony show.  That's true.  Oh, guys, I also got to congratulate you.  We're the United Nations of the insane.  I got to congratulate you for your pimp hand and getting the stripper to eat it.  Stripper to eat it?  Oh, no.  It was just a girl.  Oh, I thought it was just a girl.  Oh, no.  That was just one of our listeners, April.  She did a great job from Long Island.  Kathleen, we got to fly.  All right, go.  Thank you.  There goes Kathleen.  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:52:00]  Hey, man.  Today?  Yeah, we got to make this fast because we got a lot of people who want to check in.  All right, man.  Today, I learned that in order to have a great radio show, you have to have a rat, a knife,  and a freaking psychopath.  Yeah, that guy is worrying me just a little bit.  It's an indication when you can tell Spaz and King Gimp apart.  All right.  Thank you.  Jason from River Edge.  I learned the next time I need stock advice, I'm going to Mike Hawk.  Yeah, Mike Hawk.  Mr. Hawk, Michael Hawk, Mike Hawk, is now the stock analyst for the program. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah, Jason from River Edge picked up on that, too, Anthony.  I learned that stockbroker Dave is dead, and Mr. Hawk is his replacement.  Jason from River Edge.  I learned that ONA finally found out who their most famous listener was.  Yeah, that's true.  Syndication when you tell us what the guy was going to do with the cat.  Oops.  John from Jersey.  I learned not to listen to the show during supper.  You guys make me sick.  Do you smell what Opie and Anthony are cooking?  Frank, thanks for turning me into a vegetarian.  I think we probably did that today.  Turned a few people into vegetarians. 
[02:53:00]  I'm not eating all weekend.  Ronnie, what's going on?  What's up, you sick bastards?  Hey.  First of all, I want to apologize to my friend Ricky for barfing in his car after hearing that.  He was at the time, but I know he's listening now.  All right.  And I learned that our club soda can is a close friend of Sarah Jessica Parker.  That's a very good episode.  You should hear what they're saying about you, Sarah Jessica.  All right.  Thank you.  Take it easy, Michael.  Oh, boy.  Steve, what did you learn on the show today? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  First thing, I learned that you guys got no balls when you're confronted by a celebrity.  You are absolutely right.  And second, I learned that rat tastes like beef, and I want to try something.  You want to try it now?  Yeah.  Why not?  All right, man.  Thank you.  Hey, syndication when spaz gets a normal thought in his head.  Okay.  Later.  Jason from River Edge, I learned that there was more gagging today in the studio than in the White House during an intern interview.  Brian Regan will check with the O&A list of guests before doing another show.  Yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Brian?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned that all we need to do to feed the homeless is bring in some French chefs.  Yeah, that's true.  I also learned that you could shatter a front windshield with a vomit if you vomit hard enough after this one.  Thank you.  So, syndication when?  Yeah.  All right.  Simone, what's up?  Or Simon.  I don't even know.  Simon?  Hi, this is Simone.  Yeah, this is Simone.  Okay, what's up?  Hi, I just wanted to tell you that I learned syndication is going to come when somebody dies of mad rat disease,  which will probably be sometime tonight in their sleep. 
[02:54:30]  So, I guess you guys will be syndicated sometime Monday.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks.  These guys did sign their life away before they ate the rat.  Yeah.  The lawyers were in a panic knowing we were doing this and came up with, like, I don't know how many pages of material.  The O&A show better than a stack or two.  Thank you for that.  Yeah, absolutely.  Jack from Jersey checking in.  I'm supposed to go out to dinner after the show.  I don't know if I could even eat now.  I swear. 
[02:55:00]  I will maybe force down a salad.  A salad?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, probably a salad.  No way am I eating any type of meat.  I can't eat meat or anything.  I couldn't think of eating anything that resembles cooked rat.  Imagine getting some, like, beef and broccoli right now.  It looks just like that.  Oh, is there a scene going on out there?  Yeah, we're going to go out there in a minute or two.  Oh, my God.  In a minute or two.  Pandemonium.  Chris, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  How are you?  I learned that Opie and Anthony are human bulimia.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right. 
[02:55:30]  Syndication moves in.  All right.  I thought I could stomach everything today, but there were a few scenes that played out  that I didn't need to see today.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  All right.  I learned that I can no longer eat dinner and listen to your show at the same time.  Yeah.  Syndication, I want to get my appetite back, dudes.  How sick was that today?  Oh, that was disgusting, man.  All right.  Later.  Thank you.  Some stuff's going on.  We'll go out there in a minute.  I just can't get over the thought of Don and Mike right next door. 
[02:56:00]  They must be like, what is wrong with those people?  Yeah, Don and Mike are on.  They're eating rats.  There's strippers.  What are they doing?  We better not be missing the best part of the show.  You tell those girls to save the big act.  They're eating cat right now.  They're eating cat.  Oh, okay.  We had some listeners eating rat, and we got a couple strippers eating cat.  Eating cat.  Rare, I'm sure.  Yes.  I guess we got a couple lovely ladies from Privilege Gentleman's Club outside the studio entertaining the rat eaters. 
[02:56:30]  Yes, after eating rat, nothing better than some strippers.  We figured we would reward them doing horrible things to each other.  Well, Ant, before we go out there and check out the act, I want to thank Sarah Jessica Parker for checking in today.  Next week is Sarah Jessica Parker Appreciation Week.  Yes.  It's a whole week attributed to showing our love for Sarah Jessica Parker.  All right, we'll do that next week. 
[02:57:00]  I want to thank all the rat eaters.  I want to thank the chefs for coming down.  I want to thank the people that brought the rats.  Oh, my goodness.  Okay, listen.  And also, get us some mics.  We've got to go out there.  And seriously, guys, go see Brian Regan.  I'm telling you, I have a great time.  He's playing Rascals all weekend long.  There's two shows tonight at the Ocean Township Rascals.  You'll laugh your yam bag off.  That's an O&A promise.  And tomorrow night at Rascals West Orange, I'll see you down at one of those two shows that are happening tomorrow night, okay? 
[02:57:30]  Right.  All right, give us a microphone.  You got a mic?  A mic.  All right.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Well, Anthony, I'm happy this is going to be the last video. 
[02:58:00]  This is the visual I remember from today's show.  It's like the rat meat out of my nose.  Yes.  There's a connection between the two ladies right now, Anthony.  They're very well connected.  Two beautiful ladies from Privilege Night Club.  Privilege is located on 23rd and 11th Avenue. 
[02:58:30]  I'm stuttering again, Anthony, but this is for a good reason.  Fantastic.  They're two hot blondes, hair all the way down to their butt.  They're, uh...  It's probably the best lesbian scene we've ever had outside the studio.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Bravo, ladies.  What do you guys think?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Anthony, we can't even describe what's going on.  Um...  I think you're a bastard.  Oh, he's a rat.  So much working. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  Okay, that's...  That's good.  Wait, wait.  Anthony April, the only female listener here today, what do you think of the two girls from Privilege Night Club?  Well, I'd like to say I demand a male stripper right now.  No, that ain't...  No, that ain't...  That ain't happening.  Sorry about that.  Sorry.  Okay, very, very nice, Anthony.  I had to snake out the toilet.  Yeah.  Like a Roto-Rooter cat. 
[02:59:30]  I don't know if you're lying to me.  Yeah, get up!  Hey, Anthony, after they're done with that, they're going to slice it up and make cookies.  Yeah, it looks like one of those poppin' fresh doughboys.  Yeah.  Okay.  He's got his stuff.  He became a man.  Yeah.  In front of our eyes.  He's got an appliance.  I ain't got proof!  All right, Anthony, Steve from FoundryMusic.com, documenting everything that's going on today. 
[03:00:00]  And he's going to have a very busy weekend once again.  Steve, are you loving the show right now?  I'm speechless.  I'm really...  Yeah, baby!  Bring that shit up and eat!  Uh, I probably...  You probably didn't hear me.  The whole time, Anthony?  Uh, well, you know how it is.  It doesn't matter.  It's okay.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, she's lubing something up.  Oh, man!  Be careful I prescribe this.  Okay.  Okay.  Wow.  That's...  Oh, okay. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, you got an appliance.  Yes.  Oh.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Whack bag.  Whack bag!  Whack bag!  Whack bag!  All I can say is, one of the ladies just yelled out, look what I did to you again!  Look at her.  Wow.  I like that.  Oh, no.  She's screaming at the ladies.  Hey, rat eater.  Yeah, you like that?  Hey, how about some knocking at the back door? 
[03:01:00]  What, one of your deep purple, Anthony?  Yeah, one of your deep purple knocking at your back door.  We're so dirty.  Okay.  This guy's sick, dude.  I don't know.  You hear him?  You like it.  You like it when you stroke that.  And Mike is...  And he's like...  He's like branches from the axis.  Damn, baby!  That's pretty funny.  He's talking to me. 
[03:01:30]  He's two feet from a face.  T.F.  T.F.  T.F.  T.F.  Wonderful.  All right, there's a T.F. going on with two girls, so you figure out what's going on.  Anthony, let's get the hell off the radio before we get to the top.  Yeah, this is it.  Hey, guys, I want to thank you for being on the radio today.  Wonderful, Opie.  All right, I think we're still on the air.  We got to, like, get the hell out of here.  I want to thank the girls from Privilege, 23rd Street, and 11th Avenue. 
[03:02:00]  Is this the type of show people could see this weekend, or what?  Pretty much?  Wow.  Spaz is saying yes.  He saw it last night?  Yes.  It's fantastic.  Okay, very cool.  So we got that, and there's really nothing else to say.  I want to just thank Rick for producing the show today.  He was working his ass off.  And Ben and Spaz and Stinky with one arm.  He came back to work today for this mess.  And, of course, the person that made all this possible, Sarah Jessica Parker.  That's right.  Sarah Jessica Parker, we love you wherever you are. 
[03:02:30]  Have a great weekend.  I'll see you guys at Brian Regan tomorrow night.  If not, we'll see you on the radio Monday at 2.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's a good example of four programs.  1027-WNEW.  All right, Anthony, before we leave, we have to talk about the Razor Rollerboard scooter from the Sharper Image.  Yes, everyone enjoying these things around the studio.  And you see them all over the streets now.  People, kids, teens, and adults just having a blast riding these things around for fun and even commuting on the thing. 
[03:03:00]  And if I can interrupt for a second.  Yes, yes, Opie.  The two lovely ladies from Privilege, Gentleman's Club, outside just putting on an incredible act.  Yeah.  They have discovered new things to do with the Razor Rollerboard scooter.  Really?  Yes.  With the adjustable locking steering arm?  Yes.  Yeah, how about that?  I never thought you could ride it that way.  Just when you thought you figured out every possible way to use the Razor Rollerboard scooter,  the fine ladies at Privilege have found a couple new ones, Anthony. 
[03:03:30]  Brand new way.  I'm not sure if the Sharper Image would like to, you know, make it part of these libraries.  No, but for our own pleasure, what the hell.  Okay.  Sorry, Anthony.  You were saying, yes, the Razor Rollerboard scooter.  Gleaming stainless steel, all aluminum and aluminum inline scooter.  It's sleek looking.  It's cool.  It's a very futuristic Terminator looking thing.  State of the art.  And they're fun.  Available only from Sharper Image.

I will see you on Monday because everyone knows we don't hang out anymore.  That's right.  I don't make it out to Long Island very often.  All right.  So you have yourself a great weekend, pal.  You too.  I'll let you know if we have jobs, okay?  You too.
