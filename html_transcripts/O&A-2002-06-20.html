<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with typical nonsensical banter before launching into its introduction, providing listener phone numbers.  The hosts then attempt to find and play a *Total Recall* parody song.  A letter from "Dan" of New Jersey, detailing his unhappy marriage, miserable life, and strained relationships with his children, is read. This sparks a discussion about marital problems, divorce, child custody, and financial struggles, with several callers sharing similar experiences. One caller mentions his 12-year-old son finding a pornographic DVD, leading to further discussion about sex and relationships in the context of marriage and family life.  The conversation tangentially touches upon Long Island strip clubs and maintaining a sex life after having children.  Bill Cosby’s criticism of the Osbourne family is also mentioned.

The show then shifts to a comparison of *The Osbournes* and Bill Cosby's public image.  The hosts debate whether *The Osbournes* represents "sad" family viewing, contrasting it with Cosby's squeaky-clean persona.  They critique Cosby's perceived self-righteousness and later career choices, comparing them unfavorably to Ozzy Osbourne's longevity.  Cosby's various projects, including *Cosby Mysteries*, *Ghost Dad*, and his stand-up, are referenced.  A humorous, expletive-laden phone call, supposedly from Ozzy Osbourne, insulting Cosby, is revealed to be an impersonation.

Next, the hosts engage in their recurring bit of identifying celebrity listeners.  Several callers claim minor roles in films and television, including one claiming to be "Bruce's brother" in *Goodfellas*, another the "token white kid" on *The Cosby Show* (who later recants negative comments about Cosby), and a purported Christian Slater.  Numerous other callers claim various minor film and television roles, including one claiming to be the Gimp from *Pulp Fiction* (later revealed as a hoax).  A caller also identifies as a contestant in the show's "WOW" contest.  The segment is filled with offensive language and crude humor.

The show continues with Tiffany from Sacramento participating in a "Wow" contest, followed by discussion of a listener email detailing sexually explicit items found in their parents' drawers, including numerous vibrators.  Marianne shares a story about her child finding a vibrator, prompting further discussion about inappropriate items found in parents’ drawers. The hosts read the email’s detailed list of sex toys aloud. Pat recounts being an extra in *Devil's Advocate*.  A "F.U. line" segment allows callers to leave angry messages. Connie describes "wowing" a fan at an office party.  A prank call, using Andrew Dice Clay soundbites, is made to a fired colleague, Tom from New Orleans, resulting in a heated exchange.  The hosts dismiss a rival New Jersey radio show's claims of outperforming them. A Boston DJ and a caller from Buffalo also call in.

A substantial portion of the show is dedicated to callers sharing their experiences with drug use, including details about sexual dysfunction, paranoia, and psychological effects stemming from marijuana, cocaine, LSD, and prescription drugs like lithium and antidepressants.  The hosts discuss their own drug experiences.  Ronnie from the Ron and Fez show makes a brief in-studio appearance.  A high-speed police chase in Los Angeles is shown on screen.  The segment promotes an upcoming "Stoner Spelling Bee" and four new female contestants from Philadelphia on opianthony.com.

Finally, the hosts share drug-related anecdotes: Brewer recounts a paranoid acid trip, and Opie describes a bizarre experience with a personal pan pizza while high and the terrifying effect of watching *American Werewolf in London* on acid.  An anniversary message to the Yates family is given, and a brief crossover with the Ron and Fez show occurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Stupid freaking quat!  Yes. Calm down, Ed.  I'm just a flaming bag.  Hey!  He stinks, and I don't like him.  How about Frisket?  Oh!  Huh?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah. 
[00:00:30]  And welcome to the Opiate Anthony Show.  What are you, Ed?  Couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including D.C. today, Anthony.  D.C.  Got a little ratings thing in D.C. today.  I call it, uh...  I call it so-so.  So-so?  I call it so-so. 
[00:01:00]  So-so.  Heading in the right direction, but we got a long ways to go.  So we'll call the trend in D.C. today.  So-so.  So-so.  It's neither bad or good.  It's so-so.  You sure you don't want to save this for a 305 when they might hear it in Washington?  Are we on live right now in D.C.?  I sure hope so.  I hope so.  So if you're in D.C. or anywhere else outside of New York City and you're trying to give the show a call, write this number down. 
[00:01:30]  Write this number down.  Eventually you're going to need it, so write it down now.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  That's an easy one.  Lenny's going to say what you were just saying while we were doing that thing.  Uh-huh.  Lenny, what's up?  Not much, man.  What's going on?  Were you watching, uh...  You completely friggin' ruined it for me.  I was watching Total Recall last night.  I friggin' turned the channel and all I get...  Total Recall.  Total Recall. 
[00:02:00]  Total Recall.  Total Recall.  Total Recall.  Where is that tune?  I gotta hear that again.  We got Total Recall.  I love the Total Recall song.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I was watching last night.  And any time Arnold got in a fight or was struggling, dude, what did you hear?  He was just making the sounds.  I must get to Quato.  All the friggin' night long, I went to sleep, doctor. 
[00:02:30]  Open your mind.  Open your mind.  I can't get away from looking at your face, Quato.  Yeah, that movie's really good, though.  Yeah, not anymore.  No, it still rules.  You just gotta take it for what it is.  It's Arnold.  I can't watch any of his movies anymore without just laughing my ass off.  They've all turned into comedies now.  Yeah, well, thank God that's the only one they're playing here.  Get to the Joppa.  We're having a tough time finding Total Recall.  Total Recall.  Recall. 
[00:03:00]  Recall.  One of the worst song parodies ever.  They're great.  I move my mechanical head all around.  No, that's not the worst, man.  That's the best.  That one is great.  It'll stick in your head.  All right, Lenny.  All right.  Thanks, man.  That one.  What was the one where he was the spy?  That one.  True Lies.  True Lies.  Yeah.  That one was on with Jamie Lee Curtis.  Same thing.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  We'll find Total Recalling. 
[00:03:30]  We'll play it.  I think we want to start the show today, Anthony.  Yeah?  With a letter from one of our faithful listeners, Dan.  Hmm.  Dan from New Jersey.  Dan from New Jersey.  Jim Norton, I think, got him thinking the other day.  Did you find the song?  Yeah.  Really?  God damn it.  Okay.  Ask Rick.  Dear O&A.  Rick doesn't know?  I saw that the other day, too.  Rick's running down the hall.  You might have it.  You got Total Recalling?  Where's Total Recalling?  Where's Total Recalling?  Rick calling! 
[00:04:00]  Rick calling!  All right.  I'll stall.  We'll go with some stall tactics here.  Chris from D.C.  What's going on?  Hey, O&A.  How you guys doing?  Pretty good.  I just wanted to see you guys are blowing up down here, man.  You guys are off the hook.  I love you guys.  Off the hook.  We're trying.  The trend today was so, so.  So, so.  So, so.  So, you might want to, you know, tell someone about the show for us.  I definitely will.  All right.  Listen, I want to talk about this girl, Corinne.  I don't think she's that hot.  I listened to you guys yesterday.  Went home.  Checked her out. 
[00:04:30]  I don't know.  We're getting a lot of slack.  Because we really, we pushed Corinne big time last night on this show.  She's one of the latest contestants in the WOW contest.  Max from, I don't know where he's from.  He writes, I have to disagree.  Corinne doesn't live up to the hype.  She's just another ugly broad with big fake tees.  I think we've put her over the top a little too much.  You know what?  Because she's listening to this right now, I think she's beautiful.  Yeah.  This is one guy's opinion.  Max goes, what happened to real girls with soft, natural boobs?  How about a natural girl contest? 
[00:05:00]  No strippers, hoes, or pros.  And most of all, no fake tees.  I'm still in love with April, even though those might be fake too.  Plain Jane, Diana, and Mika from New York have the nicest sets so far.  Yeah, they were like different sizes, I thought.  Dude.  I still stand by Corinne.  She's hot.  I think she's very hot.  Yeah.  You know, it's a naughty-nighty contest, so it was so much better at this point.  I hope it gets better with the WOW.  These contests always start off slow.  You remember.  I think DC gave us the latest contestant. 
[00:05:30]  I think someone's pictures are up from DC on opnetthony.com.  What was that Spanish girl from New York?  What was her name?  I don't know.  Yeah.  She had nice ta-tas.  Who's the drinking one from Chicago?  Chicago.  She's drinking in her pictures.  She's drinking like a Cosmopolitan or something, or a martini.  Something's going on.  Who's this corn-fed one from Dallas?  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  Hey, guys.  I'm a former Long Island boy, and I used to hang out to attend the traps.  So, love you guys. 
[00:06:00]  Keep it up down here.  I almost went in that joint the other day.  Oh, two traps?  Yeah.  I was driving by and I was thinking, you know, I haven't been in there in a really long time.  I don't go to the local clubs anymore like that because they tried to pick up on what  was happening in the cities.  If you wanted to go to a city strip club, you came to the city, and you went for the  lap dances and everything like that.  If you wanted to go to your local dive hangout strip club, you'd go in there.  You didn't need a lot of money.  You know, the beers cost a lot, but then you could just slip the girls the singles as 
[00:06:30]  they made their rounds and sit and relax and just watch some cans, you know, while you're  finishing off an after work beer or something.  Now they've tried to get the whole glamour of the city strip clubs, and the girls are  like, pushy.  They want the lap dance.  They want you to pull out the 20s and stuff.  It's like, screw you.  You're out here on Long Island.  Eat me.  I like a little skank with my strip club.  Yeah.  I've gone into all this flash, and that's what I like.  I went to the tender trap because I just wanted to sit there and watch some scab that 
[00:07:00]  went to Syosset High School.  See, you know, they'll defend themselves, though.  I mean, the old tender trap was where it was at because there was a good possibility  you were going to see a girl with a gunshot wound.  No doubt.  If that's what you're looking for, that was the place.  Well, it's a little skank, you know?  And then you hit White Castle at like 3.30, and it was a great night.  Yeah.  There you go.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right, Chris.  The hot ones, the big strip clubs, they don't let you touch the girls or anything.  You can't get your clothes.  Yeah, you never knew if in the smaller clubs out on Long Island especially, you never 
[00:07:30]  knew if you're sitting there if, you know, you're going to be able to cop a feel or she'd  come up to grab the dollar from you and grab it with her cans and just press your hand  in there or something.  There was always a mystery.  Because there'd be five guys in there and three dancers, and the girls want to make  money.  Right.  It's looking like you just dipped it in rubber cement.  It's true, though.  And they do the tricks.  Remember the girls that like...  I remember going to the strip clubs during lunch. 
[00:08:00]  We were supposed to be working, and we'd go into the strip clubs, and like Jimmy said,  there were only about four or five guys in there.  You're sitting around, and the girls would get creative.  They'd have to.  They're picking up beer bottles.  They're picking up beer bottles.  Without their hands.  That's worth a buck.  A buck?  I don't like tricks.  I don't mind the tricks, because what are you doing there?  You're just watching it.  Ah, there's nothing wrong with a little trick.  Nah, dude, I never like...  Don't pick up my full $10 beer.  You know, I don't want that.  The empties.  What about the match trick on the booby? 
[00:08:30]  That's just silly, but it's always fun to watch, because she might burn herself.  Where she splits the match stick up and puts it over her kneepee, and then lights them,  and she dances around while they're on fire.  I don't like that at all.  I like the picking up trick.  Oh, yuck.  That's good.  I never liked that.  And the lost art of the rug act.  The rug act.  You don't see it anymore.  They play the slow song on the jukebox.  We got tonight.  They'd open up that bedspread.  Play that song.  We got tonight, babe. 
[00:09:00]  Why don't you stay?  And she's doing all the leg moves, something she learned in ballet class in the seventh grade.  And she's just doing it.  It was great.  Indoor-outdoor carpeting.  Yeah.  The scissors moves.  The scissor legs.  She's on her back, right?  Her feet are facing you.  She now lifts her legs up, so you've got a great view.  And then does that flutter, flitter with her legs.  Slowly crossing her, or quickly crossing her ankles back and forth. 
[00:09:30]  But those, it's a lost art.  The local strip clubs.  Because now they all think they, they all think they're, you know, privileged.  Or the places that you would go to for the lap dance or the private room.  There was one place in Long Island.  It was a great after work strip club.  And they built, they corralled off an area.  The place was small enough.  And called it, like, the champagne room.  Yeah.  Dude, it was a closet.  It was a closet with a chair in it. 
[00:10:00]  Like, what are you trying to do here?  Accept what you are.  You're a local after work strip club.  And don't try to make it so now the girls are going to take into this barely walk-in closet and then give them the 20 for a lap dance.  The minor leagues.  But you know what?  You see some good ball in the minor leagues sometimes.  Yeah.  You do, you know?  But you've got to accept you're in the minor leagues.  I don't want to pay pro ball ticket prices for minor league ball though.  That's right.  You've got some up and coming stars in the minor leagues and that's good enough for us.  But when you're expected to pay full ticket price for, like, going to a major league game and you see a minor league ball, there's the problem. 
[00:10:30]  But stop with the tricks.  I don't need anything picked up.  I don't want to put my finger in it and get it snapped like when Brundle Fly was arm wrestling.  It's awesome.  All right, we stole long enough.  I don't think we're going to find total recalling.  You sons of bitches.  One of my favorite songs.  That is one of my favorite song parodies.  We were cleaning up some stuff the other day and we ran across it and I'm thinking to myself, well, we're never going to have the opportunity to play this. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, yeah, whoever's been putting our various faces on the contestants to the WoW Contest bodies.  Amazing job.  That one of Norton is really good.  Yeah.  You got to go to foundrymusic.com for those photos.  Would you F me?  The link is off opianthony.com.  Would you F me?  Would you F me?  The only problem is the cans in the picture are smaller than mine.  That pig I'm turning into.  I'm crying over you, crying, crying. 
[00:11:30]  All right, let me start with this guy's letter.  All right.  Looks like he needs a little help, a little support today.  A guy named Dan from Jersey.  It says, Dear ONA, life sucks.  No, really.  Life really effing sucks.  But you two at least give me some satisfaction during my day.  And let's talk about my average effing day.  Which one is that, May?  Hold on, don't do that.  No distractions right now. 
[00:12:00]  I wake up at 4 a.m. to the same effing face that I've been waking up to for the last 18 years.  The C forgot how to give good H for the last 15 years.  Oof.  Good, you know, Homer.  And then when I suggest she wears some of the Victoria's Secret outfits I got, I got her.  It's a whole effing production.  No nylons, no thongs, no effing excitement.  I'd F around on her, but I know I'd get caught.  I don't want to lose half the S I own, especially since I paid for all the S myself.  I know the C would go out and get the best effing piece of S lawyer to help her F me over. 
[00:12:30]  She can't stand to see any money in my bank account and love to spend the entire effing amount to the last effing penny.  The bitch doesn't know that I changed my life insurance.  She doesn't get S.  Ha, ha, ha.  My girls get everything.  Let that C scavenge through the dumpsters out of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  I also have two daughters.  My 12-year-old can't wait for me to come home, but only when she needs something.  Otherwise, I could die on the effing highway on the way home.  She cops this effing attitude with me and thinks she knows more than anyone else in the entire effing world.  I kind of understand John List now. 
[00:13:00]  My other daughter is four and she's a doll.  I actually get joy from her.  She's the only one in the effing house who's happy when I get home.  My wife hasn't poisoned her mind yet.  Why is it that it's my wife's goal to get my kids to hate me?  I work from 6 a.m. until 4 p.m.  My job allows me to deal with greedy scumbags whose only joy is to eff me.  I love this guy already.  He sounds like he's ready to snap and I love that.  When I got married, I was in great shape.  Now I'm a fat, out of shape turd.  But that's changing. 
[00:13:30]  I've lost 20 pounds and have another 40 to go.  I'm doing it to drive my effing wife crazy.  She asked me if I plan on effing around when I get skinny.  I tell her that my goal is to eff her best friend and then wipe my you-know-what off on my wife's face.  Nice.  I'm cleaning this up as we go.  Oh, this is great.  Bear with me.  Can you believe that the C gets angry at that?  If it weren't for my friends who are real cool and share the same Essie lives,  I think I would make your average psycho AK-47 armed mailman look like a teddy bear. 
[00:14:00]  Where the eff did I go wrong?  Anthony, how did you manage to introduce another woman into your bed?  I'm listening, really.  I'm at the foot of the master.  Just share your insight.  Just let me know how I can get out of this rut.  Should I find a little something on the side?  Where is the best place to find some good trim that is only interested in effing and will keep her bitch mouth shut?  Please share these truths with your disciples.  I know I can't be the only one out there with this sort of pathetic life.  Wow. 
[00:14:30]  Please let me know what to do, when to do it, how to do it, and where to do it.  I only need a little road map to help me out of this fog.  Please send help.  Faithfully yours, Dan from Jersey.  This guy is miserable.  That guy is in a living hell, and you know something?  He's absolutely right.  He's not going to be able to get out of that because the way the laws are, he'll be paying through the nose for the kids and his wife.  Here's a guy now, because of laws.  That guy might as well be in jail.  He is locked into a life that is not going the way he wants it to go and can't get out. 
[00:15:00]  There's nothing he can do about it.  He cannot leave.  And you completely, can you totally hear what he's saying about that?  He comes home, there's that C, just ragging him.  The daughter though, 12 year old daughter, what do you expect?  You know, those are just, that's the way kids are.  He's probably just bitter because his wife is a C.  And the 12 year old daughter, they get to that point where they get their own lives and their own personalities and attitude. 
[00:15:30]  And they just don't like their parents.  You know what I mean?  Especially the father, nothing in common with him.  But the other one, of course, she's still young.  So, you know, you figure she's cool.  But the life you were in, dude, oh, here's what I would do.  Uh oh.  I'm just going to be honest.  Hookers?  No, not hookers.  Why not?  Just interject.  Why not a hooker?  Because you're not going to get caught.  You're going to get all the pleasure you want.  This is more than just sex with a guy.  Yeah, I'm with it.  This whole thing isn't just sex with a guy. 
[00:16:00]  It's not all about the lust factor.  The guy wants a little love.  If it was just about that, you could crank it.  And once you're done, the problem's over.  You know what I mean?  This guy needs a little something.  Shovel in a shallow grave.  You're right.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  Yeah, murder's a good idea.  What this guy needs though is to lose the weight like he does.  Get in shape like he is.  Just start going out.  If the old rag at home is giving you crap about it, F her.  Who cares? 
[00:16:30]  What's she going to do about it?  Just go out and find yourself somebody.  Find yourself somebody.  See how it works.  And then if you find someone you really care about, there.  It makes the misery of having to pay through the nose and go through all that crap that much easier.  There you go.  That's what I'm saying.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, man.  I can relate to that story.  I'm going through the same thing as a matter of fact.  In what way?  It sucks. 
[00:17:00]  Actually, I'm separated going through a divorce.  And yeah, mine's the same way.  That's all she's looking for is the pretty penny and that's it.  Never really even wanted a husband slash family, I think.  Just kids.  And now she doesn't even know what to do with them.  Can't even take care of them.  So I'm actually going to be fighting for custody myself.  Oh, God.  When you bring kids into the mix, it's just a big cluster F.  Oh, yeah.  I'm telling you.  It's too funny.  I mean, even my family gets walked on and stepped on.  She's living in a condo that my family owns and won't even pay her rent. 
[00:17:30]  Isn't that great?  Isn't that great?  Oh, my God.  One of my swimmy little cells never punctured that egg.  Oh.  I'm telling you.  She needs something.  Would that have sucked.  God knows what.  Something to smarten her up.  To show you how much these paternity laws suck, Elizabeth Hurley is pregnant and is going  to get alimony or is going to get child support.  As much money as that bitch has.  Yeah.  And if she was any good in bed, Hugh Grant wouldn't have been out paying some chick. 
[00:18:00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Ah, there you go.  Probably much too proper.  Exactly.  Hell, I will not hob your knob.  By the way, Anthony, that letter I just read.  Yeah.  Jason called me.  It wasn't Dan.  It was Kevin Spacey from American Beauty.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  How hot was that scene with the Marine?  When you have kids, though, then even after you're divorced, you got to have some kind  of contact with the woman because you had kids with them. 
[00:18:30]  Or, you know, you got a partner on the show that has some kind of, you know, just things.  Just something to keep.  I really thought we were both getting divorced.  I don't get it.  I thought if one stopped and it was obvious that both of us would not be involved anymore.  What happened?  That is killing me. 
[00:19:00]  I thought we were both getting divorced in some weird way.  How is it that now I'm coming?  I have to spend a dinner at you, but it was your wife.  Why is she now coming?  Why do I have...  Exactly.  Why?  Why?  Hey.  It cost me enough money to get out of that situation.  Now it's your problem.  I just thought we were both getting divorced.  Apparently not.  I'm the same person there. 
[00:19:30]  Kevin, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right.  I'm just listening to this.  This guy is doing a real good job talking to us.  Yeah.  I've been through the same thing.  My wife, she constantly...  I'm divorced now and I'm actually helping her move again for the second time.  Why are you helping her?  Why am I helping her?  Because she just calls me up non-stop.  She won't leave me alone.  Tell her to stop.  It's pretty hard to do that.  Why?  She effed you over and she's still coming to you for help and you're helping her out? 
[00:20:00]  I know.  I'm paying her, you know, three quarters of my paycheck a week goes to her.  Do you want to get back with her?  No.  No.  Tell her to stop bothering you.  Tell her to get lost.  I tell her that all the time.  You're a wimp.  I'm a wimp.  You're a puss.  Yeah.  Next time she asks you for help.  The only thing I can understand is because in your crazy little mind you want to get  back with her, but if you don't want to get back with her and you're losing over half  your money to her and she continues to call you for your help and you're helping her, 
[00:20:30]  you're nuts.  Well, this is it.  I'm done there.  Dude, I'm not trying to be really harsh, but what you have to sometimes call someone  and say is, look, I'm not keen on you anymore.  Right.  Okay.  You want us to?  She calls out, what are you doing this weekend?  What are you doing?  I'm like, I'm busy.  You want us to call her?  What's that?  We'll call her.  You want us to call her?  We're good at this type of thing.  We'll set her straight.  You tell us what you want us to tell her and we'll tell her.  She's really possessive, I think, and she don't want to leave. 
[00:21:00]  We're divorced and I don't think she gets it.  Kevin, give me her number and we'll tell her to leave you alone.  Yeah, I don't want to get her in harassment and stuff.  I mean, we're actually friendly to each other, but she's still just, you know, a little  bit too possessive.  I don't know what, I don't want to stay friends with her because I have a son for her.  No, she knows she's got a sap and she's going to use you.  Yeah.  Well, she, I mean.  Yep.  You're still the workhorse.  I'm still the workhorse.  How stupid is that?  I'm paying her a freaking rent.  You know what you're doing? 
[00:21:30]  She asks you to come over to do something.  You come over, go to a hooker and everything you're doing when you're moving stuff, she is permanently  attached to your mule.  Just the whole time you're doing something.  Okay.  Where do you want this?  And she's got to look at you with the hooker just.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I hear these.  Watch that S word.  I'm sorry.  I mean.  Kevin.  Yeah.  You're a wimp.  Yeah.  I know I am.  You're a wimp, man. 
[00:22:00]  You're pee whipped, man.  What do you want from us?  I have a girlfriend already.  Yeah.  Oh, but she must love that you go over there to help out your ex-wife.  Well, she's like, this girl is so sweet, but she's like, I hope you get back with your  wife.  I think.  I was like, no, I don't want her back.  You obviously want her back.  Yeah, you do.  There's something there that you don't even realize.  No way.  Why are you talking to her like that?  Why are you tolerating her bunk?  I'm not really tolerant.  I'm just helping her out.  Why?  Why?  Think about it.  I don't know.  Why?  Why? 
[00:22:30]  Why should I?  Exactly.  I can't be mean to her.  Why not?  She just effed you over.  Yeah.  She was so terrific.  You would have stayed married to her.  Take a look at your paycheck.  Yeah.  Since we got married, she gained like, you know, the average 60, you know, 100 pounds.  I don't know.  And then they sit around the house and expect you to work 12 hours.  Look, man, when I get...  And then when you tell them you start getting fed up, they just...  Does she...  All of a sudden they snap.  Oh, your meal's cooked and...  You know what?  When I get married, I'm going to have all sorts of clauses in there.  Clauses. 
[00:23:00]  Gain...  Gain...  Gain four pounds.  Four pounds.  Well, there should be a scale on the front door or something.  You know what I mean?  Four pounds.  Gain four pounds.  Marriage over.  You get nothing.  You get nothing.  You get nothing.  Are you kidding me?  All sorts of clauses.  Wow.  That's a tough one.  Four pounds.  No matter how black your eyes are, you fell.  All right, Kevin.  Thanks.  Hey, thanks, man.  Talk later.  That's a pussy right there. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  The guy doesn't even realize.  He obviously wants to get back with his ex-wife.  Charlie, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  How you doing?  Martin's the man.  Hi, Charlie.  What do you got?  Hey, I can help that time bomb in that jersey, Dan.  Yeah, let's call him the time bomb.  I can help him.  Yeah.  I got the plan.  I got it figured out.  All right.  He needs to drug his wife and impregnate her with somebody else's sperm.  Mmm.  Yeah.  Get out scot-free.  Hey.  Hey.  What do you think?  Where's he going to get it?  Yeah. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  Have one of his boys.  Yank one in a cup.  Oh, oh, oh.  All right, Charlie.  All right, fellas.  Bye.  Yeah, there's, you know, something.  It's actually not a bad idea, though.  You know, we got to take a break, because we hit on something.  The phones have exploded.  We weren't even going to go in that direction.  What the hell?  I don't agree with O.J.  But I understand.  I understand.  I understand.  A lot of unhappy people out there.  Of course there are.  They want to jump in on this one today.  Also, we had a lot of success with O.J.  But I understand.  I understand.  I understand.  A lot of unhappy people out there.  Of course there are. 
[00:24:30]  They want to jump in on this one today.  Also, we had a lot of success with that kid thing yesterday.  Wasn't that fun?  What?  I'm thinking of taking it to the next level.  There's a next level to that one?  Yeah, I'm going to share it with you during commercials.  Okay.  Can't wait to hear it.  If you like it, we'll go with it today.  All right.  It could be very interesting.  Let's take a stab at it.  The Opie and Anthony F.U. Line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.

[00:25:30]  The unmistakable sound of Filter.  A little taste of their latest song, Where Do We Go From Here.  The CD's going to be out July 30th, Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We just read an email from this guy, Dan, from Jersey.  He's absolutely miserable.  Stuck in a marriage. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  He doesn't want to be in anymore.  But it was bad.  I mean, it sounds like his wife is just a rag.  Stopped giving him sex.  Turned into a pig.  Just his life is miserable.  He works his ass off, comes home.  And he even said he got us some Victoria's Secret stuff for her to wear.  Maybe spice up things in the bedroom.  Sounds like the guy's trying.  He's pulling teeth to try it.  Well, yeah, and he said, look, he hasn't cheated. 
[00:26:30]  But he's thinking about it.  Wants to do it.  Because how are you a man?  You get home, you know, and your wife's been putting you off.  And you buy her some Victoria's Secret.  Maybe, you know, put that fat body into something.  It might look a little better.  Might be able to get about three quarter.  You know what I mean?  And then she's, he said it was like pulling teeth.  That's what you want.  You want to be married for years and begging.  Begging this bitch that's holding that over your head. 
[00:27:00]  Ugh.  He should only have sex with a hooker and bring you the gift of AIDS on the one night a year you want to F.  The gift of crabs.  The gift that keeps on giving.  Ugh.  Take that with you.  Debra, very pissed off.  Debra.  Yes.  Go ahead, Debra.  I am very pissed off.  What's the problem there, Debra?  I mean, you guys are always ragging on the women that don't take care of themselves.  What about the fat slob men that we're stuck with?  Well, very bad.  I mean, I'm 38.  I take care of myself. 
[00:27:30]  And my husband is a couch potato.  Yeah.  Yeah?  So why don't you move on?  We have three children.  Well, you know something?  See, you win in the divorces.  See, you could leave him.  You could leave him.  You could leave him right now.  If you're miserable with your husband, why don't you leave?  My children.  What about your children?  Do you get to keep them?  They need a dad.  Ah, see?  See?  Now, the guy that wants...  See what?  Wait, wait.  See, the guy, when he wants to leave that relationship that we were just speaking of, 
[00:28:00]  because he's in hell, he can't leave because she would get the kids, she gets his money,  and he's effed.  Excuse me, I'm the one with the money.  So then what?  So I don't need his money, but my kids need their dad.  So I'm stuck until they're grown.  Then give him custody.  Now, when you guys are together, do the kids, do they think you're a happy couple?  Yes.  But you're not, really.  You fake it in front of them?  Sure.  And what happens when you two are alone?  Is it all fighting and everything? 
[00:28:30]  No, we just don't communicate.  Do you have any relations anymore?  Or is that kind of...  That's kind of gone.  Yeah?  Are you going elsewhere for it?  No.  No?  Is he?  No.  Are you sure?  No.  But I've got to bring up something that yesterday I was listening to you on the way home with  the kids finding what's in their parents' drawers.  Yeah.  I wanted to call.  My 12-year-old son wanted to watch the DVD of Harry Potter.  So the player is only in our bedroom.  Uh-oh. 
[00:29:00]  So I said, go ahead, honey, you can go play.  All of a sudden I hear him go, Mom!  Mom!  Mom!  I run downstairs.  You know what DVD he finds in the DVD player?  What?  The art on the CD.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  You can't say that B-job word.  I'm sorry.  Hold on.  Anthony will clean it up.  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  That's okay.  Oh, my God.  We dumped out of it.  I'm so sorry.  Now we've got to explain that.  Your son found a DVD, The Art of European B-jobs. 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  And what's the difference between how they're doing it and how...  I have no idea.  The ladies are doing it over here.  I don't know.  After the guy dumps, they surrender?  And how far into it?  I guess they do it in different language.  I don't know.  When you came running in, what was on the screen while he was sitting there?  He didn't hit play, but on the DVD are pictures of...  Mom, that's a Harry Potter.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  But he promised...  He begged me not to tell his daddy found it.  Harry Potter and the Saucer's Bone.  But you guys are great.  I wanted to...  You guys are really great.  So how do you take care of yourself?  Do you take care of yourself, at least?  No.  Because, you know...  No, I'm very boring.  You've just given up on any pleasure in that fashion?  Yeah.  Faction.  God, that sucks.  Yeah, it sucks.  He's a very comedian.  It does suck.  All right, Debra.  Well, good luck to you.  Okay.  Keep it up, guys.  You guys are great.  We're not trying to trash all the women out there.  I mean...  No, that's not about it.  All I'm saying is...  Dan's email, it was obvious that, you know, that he's not doing much wrong. 
[00:30:30]  Are there going to be some cases where the woman is in the exact same position that  this guy whose letter we just wrote it?  Of course there is.  There's going to be cases like that.  But for the most part, if a woman is in a marriage where the guy is in a marriage,  is miserable, he's a rag, he's abusive, whatever, she can leave.  She will get the kids.  She will keep the house.  She won't even have to leave.  What am I saying?  Leave. 
[00:31:00]  She can have him removed from her life, from her marriage.  Goodbye.  You stay in the house.  You get the kids.  You get an income because of his money.  I don't want to hear that it's your money.  All right.  That's another case.  I'm talking about you're a mom.  You stay home with the kids.  The guy works.  He brings home the check.  If you're miserable with him, you can throw him out.  You get to keep everything.  The guy, on the other hand, has to leave his house, go to some crap apartment that he's  got to pay for, pay for your lawyer, pay for the kids, pay for you to F another guy, 
[00:31:30]  whatever it is.  The guy gets raped.  You're right.  But there are two teeny little factors, though.  There's two little things that occasionally balance out the scales.  It's harder for a girl with kids to meet a new guy than it is for...  So, deal with it.  And there's always the option that he might come back and kill her because of the whole  domestic violence thing.  I know.  Women don't kill their ex-husbands, but ex-husbands kill their ex-wives.  That's true.  But does that really even it out?  No, I'm just saying a little bit more.  I'm not saying you're wrong.  I'm just throwing that in there. 
[00:32:00]  Check out this story from Holly.  Holly, what's up?  Not much.  I've been pregnant for two years.  Yeah.  I have a 13-month-old son that was born in April.  Oof.  And I have a daughter that was born three weeks ago.  So, you've just been pregnant now for years.  Yes.  And I missed the River Rave twice in a row, and I was really bummed out about it.  And, well, getting back to the sex thing.  All right.  When my husband comes home, I watch Elmo and Big Bird all day. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  And when we're starting to do it, I see Elmo or Big Bird in my head, and I just get totally turned off.  Like, our sex life is so bad that one time I wanted to satisfy myself.  So, I said, honey, I want to, I'm going to take a little nap for 15 minutes.  Yeah.  And then he was like, oh, okay.  And the babies were, they were sleeping and stuff.  And I satisfied myself, and I walked back in the room, and the VCR is hot, and he's putting back a porno tape that we bought. 
[00:33:00]  He was taking a nap.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They don't like that M word, but.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That's all right.  All listeners to this show, they have to realize we cannot say the M word for self-pleasuring anymore.  It's so stupid, but.  But, so he was taking care of himself, and you were taking care of yourself.  Yeah.  We want to hear about your nap, though. 
[00:33:30]  How about helping each other out?  Well, the thing, the thing is that, like, I just had a three weeks ago, so I can't really do anything.  Okay, you know something, Holly, and this is to everybody else, because we're going to hear stories like this a million times, and I've heard it a million times.  When, when guy and girl get together to live their life, you have an option to make at a point in your relationship.  Do you want to procreate, or do you want to enjoy your life as sexual human beings? 
[00:34:00]  Because everybody I've spoken to gives up any fun, any spontaneity, any banging over the kitchen sink, you know, and I'm sure people that are married and have kids have, there are some out there that have wonderful sex lives, but it seems to me.  We have a wonderful sex life, obviously, if we have two kids in a row, you know, we do, we like to, we love to do it.  It's a choice that people have to make, though. 
[00:34:30]  You want to have kids, you want to have a family, that's one thing.  You want to just stick to effing?  I mean, the kids screw it up all the time.  Doesn't it seem that way?  Yes.  Kids, they ravage a woman's body.  I'm just saying, now they can, you know, girls, I've seen girls that have had kids that are in a million times better shape than girls that are around that haven't had kids.  We've had the MILF contest.  Right.  And we've had some fine specimens come through that door.  But you know something?  I'm one of those nine girls, let me tell you.  Child, we're amazing. 
[00:35:00]  You know, something happens, the boobs, they get a little, did your boobs get a little saggier?  No.  No, did the, did the, I think she's a young mother.  How old are you?  I'm 22.  Wow.  Dude, the worst is trying to have phone sex with a girl who has kids.  I hate that, because the kids are always such C-blockers, you're like, oh yeah, and then what?  You could probably hear my son in the background right now.  What made me think of that?  She made me think of that.  I love how Jim comes up with things on this show that no one else can relate to.  Yeah, you know when you're having phone sex and the kids.  But you never had phone sex with a girl who has kids and then she's like. 
[00:35:30]  And I'm going to open my mouth and hold on.  Put that back.  And then I'm going to let you back in.  That's why we love you on this show, though.  You come up with stuff and you throw it out there in a way like.  Like everyone should know this.  You know, guys, you know what I'm talking about.  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  Dude, I've had phone sex with a lot of women.  Have I had phone sex before?  Yes.  Have I had phone sex with a kid in the background?  No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not that the kid is sitting right there, but the woman we're having and the kid.  No, I understand what you're saying.  And she'll yell at him.  Hold on one second.  Put that back.  But I wanted to ask you a question.  Yeah, go ahead, Holly.  It's such a turn off. 
[00:36:00]  I missed both River Raves in the last two years.  Yeah.  Maybe if you could close your legs for three minutes, you could get to a concert.  No, no, no.  It's nothing like that.  Time your pregnancy around the summer concert schedule.  What do you want?  Stop banging in September so you're finished.  No, I want to see.  Stop having a sex fest and you can go to Oz fest.  Well, I was wondering.  Almost, though.  It was, you know, I had confidence.  I was wondering since I've done my do with kids and we're done, he's all top. 
[00:36:30]  My husband got snipped and everything.  Holly?  I was wondering if you guys could arrange for me to go to the anger management tour.  That's all what I want out of life.  I haven't been out since I've had my daughter.  Holly?  Yes?  We're bored with you.  We've got to move on.  Oh, you're kidding me.  Oh, jeez.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  See what should be arranged for her. 
[00:37:00]  Go talk to her.  You give me that look.  Very mean-spirited.  Go talk to her.  Very mean-spirited.  Go find her tickets.  Very mean-spirited, indeed.  She's Elmo all day.  She has to go in and take her quote-unquote nap.  Can you imagine that?  Two years she's been with child.  Dude, if your husband's checking out the art of the European Homer...  Yeah.  She must suck.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Not only can you...  That's leaving a hint in the friggin' VCR, in the DVD players, what that is.  That's a hint.  Hey, gee, why is this in here?  Take a hint, unless your hubby is out at the gay bars in front of the glory hall and he's 
[00:37:30]  been getting complaints.  You know, why else is that DVD in your player?  Stop worrying about River Rave and start learning how to do it properly.  No teeth.  How do you not feel you're scraping a fleshy object?  Women are stupid.  Let's go to Emily.  Ass of aggressive whore.  But even a bad one's a good one.  No, it's not.  Kind of like pizza.  That was a joke I tried once about...  I know.  No such thing as bad hummers. 
[00:38:00]  Even if a girl dies while she's doing it, that's an okay hummer.  Emily, you're on the air.  Emily.  Hello?  Oh, it said Emily on the air.  It says Emily.  I don't know.  Lisa.  I don't know my voice.  It's like weird.  What's up, Lisa?  Getting back to Dan, I can't have any real sympathy for him because he said he's been married  for 18 years.  She stopped giving him good hummers 13 years before he has a 12-year-old daughter. 
[00:38:30]  So he was getting a hint already that this wife of his wasn't going to be the caring,  nurturing woman that he wanted to be with.  So, you know, he can cry 18 years later, but he should have stepped out or he should have  put his foot down 13 years ago.  I'll agree.  You know something?  I mean, and it goes the same for the people.  Oh, I need to stay friends with my ex.  No, you don't.  Absolutely not.  Cut all ties.  Thank you.  That's what you got to do.  All right, Lisa.  All right.  Bye, Norton.  Bye. 
[00:39:00]  Oh.  Oh, wait, miss.  Lisa.  Lisa.  Whoa, hey.  It's Tink...  Whoa, hey.  Oh, sorry.  I have a Sprint phone, Norton.  You know what that's like.  No, that's...  Hey, but where are you?  Are you inside of a toilet?  No, that's Eric's...  No, inside my car.  Is that Eric's phone?  Or is he taking off?  He's calling from the tarmac at JMK.  Lisa, I was going to say, it's Tinkledrinker at AOL.com.  We got to go.  All right.  Bye.  That's Jimmy's thing there.  Go ahead, Eric. 
[00:39:30]  Are you there?  Yeah, Eric.  Where are you?  What's up?  Listen, I got to scream at these bitches who were calling up saying that they lost sexual  interest.  How the hell does that happen?  I can't stop effing.  And all these women are calling up, oh, I just don't want to have love anymore.  You know what?  What is that?  I'll tell you one thing, and this is one thing, and I'm...  One thing with the women I'll say that they're right about, a lot of guys do come home  and get fat and have no idea how to make the woman feel good anymore.  They just expect her to lay back and cough it up.  Right.  And that's why the women start getting angry and not wanting to give it up, because the  guy's not talking to him anymore. 
[00:40:00]  He's not communicating.  So when you're angry at somebody, you don't want to bang him.  You're right.  So a lot of it is the guy's fault.  It's not just the women.  Very true.  Very true, Jimmy.  It's our fault as men, too.  All right, Eric.  All right.  Hey, Norton, you rocked on Comedy Central.  Thanks, fella.  Can I ask Eric something?  God damn.  I want to know where the hell he was.  I don't know.  Where the hell was that?  He was just...  At the airport.  Eh.  What's wrong with John here?  John, what's going on?  Johnny!  Yo.  Johnny.  What's up, John? 
[00:40:30]  You're next on the O&A show.  Yo.  It's W-Y-S-P in the house.  All right, John.  In the his eye.  John, fat.  Hey.  Hey, man, I was about to stop listening to you guys after the softball game, because  the show...  Language, you tool.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  That F word is verboten.  John, you can't say that on the radio.  I'm sorry.  You want to say the last few days have been good, right?  Thank you.  The last few days have been the best.  Well, that's what this radio show is all about.  It's like a roller coaster.  You can't have amazing shows every day of the week. 
[00:41:00]  It's impossible.  It has its ups and downs, my friend.  So the faithful listeners, they understand, and they...  I don't know.  They help us through the low points.  They stick with us.  They stick with us until we get the roller coaster going back up one of those little hilly  things.  I think it's more like the surfer out there, Opie.  You're looking at the waves coming in, and sometimes it's like, I can't ride these waves  in.  They're crappy waves.  And then that big one comes and gives you a good ride.  Yeah.  So you can paddle out and wait for the next one.  Every day of a relationship is not perfect. 
[00:41:30]  There are days when things are a little mundane.  Maybe she's tired and she's bragging.  Right.  True.  What, Jim?  And there's the days where, you know...  What?  You'll come home and she'll just put it in her mouth.  I've been dreaming.  Oh.  Oh.  All right, listen.  God damn.  You found it.  What's that?  We found it.  What?  Well, the people that listen to the whole show know what we're talking about.  Finally.  I love this one. 
[00:42:00]  We started off the show talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Total Recall.  Total Recall was on TBS last night.  And we're all in agreement that it's really tough to watch the Arnold Schwarzenegger movies  these days because of all the clips we've been playing over the years.  It's just too funny now.  Yeah.  Right?  People love the Arnold clip.  So we have in our possession here probably the worst song parody ever done.  But it makes us laugh really hard.  It's done in the Arnold voice.  And it's about Total Recall, which was on last night.  And every time I see Total Recall, I think of this song. 
[00:42:30]  So today I wanted to hear it because I watched it last night.  We know this is awful, but it makes us giggle.  I find it very funny.  So enjoy.  I've been dreaming of going to Mars  Where mutants drive plastic cars  So I go there  You know the rest  The best part was the girl with three breasts 
[00:43:00]  Total Recall  Dylan  Recalling  Total Recall  Recalling  So I'm on Mars  And I meet Cueto 
[00:43:30]  And I pull this big metallic thing out of my nose  It makes me scream and shout  And move my big robotic head all about  Total Recall  Recalling  Recalling  See you at the party, Victor 
[00:44:00]  Total Recall  Recalling  Recalling  Recalling  One more time, fellas  Total Recalling  Total Recalling  Total Recalling  Total Recalling  Total Recalling  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm going to start falling  I'm  So sad  I can't  Screw Sharon Stone  And

[00:45:00]  It's not working  Right  Johnny, grab my hand  Come on  That is funny  Look, man  We know  We know it's awful  But that will be stuck in your head  In the middle of the night  You go to the bathroom  We take a leak  What are you going to be singing?  Recalling  Totally  And move my big robotic head  All around 
[00:45:30]  Totally  Recalling  It makes us chuckle  I love that one  Hey, Ray, what's going on?  No, it's Lanny again  Huh?  It's Lanny again  Hey, what's up  I don't know why you said Ray  The freaking guy did it to me again  Yeah  I called up earlier  And told you  I had to freaking hear it in my head  All goddamn night long  Oh, now it's stuck in your head  That's why we  You reminded us  Thank you, bro  All right  Well, we're going to step aside here, Anthony  Yes, yes 
[00:46:00]  We got to talk about  The fat people on the airplanes  People a little upset  Some of the fatties  We got to talk about Cosby  Thinking that the Oz family is sad  Billy Joel in rehab  Lots of great things to get to today  Hopefully we'll get to one of those things  You think so?  Or we'll be on the list tomorrow  A little further down  No, we'll get to some of that stuff  Yeah  Hi, we're here  We're here under your skin  Us two A-holes  Hello  Opie and Anthony 
[00:46:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show  People seem to enjoy Total Recalling  I'm looking at it on the instant feedback  People want it back up on Foundry  It's all in the setup, my friend  We're smart  You tell them how awful it is  And then they listen and go  You know what?  It's not too bad  It's kind of catchy in a weird sort of way  I pulled that metallic thing out of my nose 
[00:47:00]  Matt has a problem  What's wrong, Matt?  Hey, what's up?  Hey  Are you guys adding, like, noises to these commercials?  That one's crashed in my car  No  What are you talking about?  No  I swear, like, I'm listening to a commercial  Like, you know, waiting for you guys to come back  And all of a sudden I hear, like, a cell phone ringing  And it sounds like it's in the backseat of my car  So I start turning around to look for the cell phone ringing  And I turn around and I almost smash into the car in front of me  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that noise 
[00:47:30]  What noise, Matt?  Yeah  You gotta be hearing things  And then that other commercial  I heard, like, the AOL, you got mail thing  And I was like, alright, these guys gotta be effing with me  Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about  During the commercials  And I go and play a little foosball  A little, uh  A little foos  A little foosball  A little pinball  Yeah  We're not even in the studio  It's all automated  I mean, we can't eff with the commercials  Even if we wanted to  Oh, no 
[00:48:00]  No, no, not at all  Alright, Matt  Alright, thanks, guys  Bye  Peace  Wow, wow  Wow, wow  Well, Anthony Cosby has a problem with the Osbournes  This guy is so delusional  He's so holier than thou  And he's been riding that show that was on  Was his show on in the 50s?  When was that show on?  He's still riding that like he is actually Dr. Huxtable 
[00:48:30]  I think he's just jealous  He sees all the success of the Osbournes  And he wishes he still had that type of success  Yeah  It's very obvious  I mean, the fact is  No one wants to watch the Cosmes anymore  It had its time  But now we're on to the Osbournes  It's dated and it doesn't hold up  And the Osbournes is based in reality  Sorry it's not some forced utopian ideas  About how people should be perceived  It's real people  Sorry it's not a doctor and a lawyer  And three perfect kids  Yeah 
[00:49:00]  And great parents  Purposely trying to break stereotypes  Just for the sake of breaking stereotypes  Right  He never liked his show  He's a great comic  Although he never touched people like Pryor did  Ever  Does that bug you?  That you were around longer than Pryor  And you never hit home like he did?  You were never as relevant as he was  I never found Bill Cosby funny  His stand-up I thought was a long, drawn-out, boring monologue  Where he'd sit there and talk down to everybody 
[00:49:30]  And I hate it  It's horrid  I gotta say he was a great stand-up  And I wanna trash him  No  No, I really gotta be honest  I like him as a stand-up  Although as a person  I just  This is gross  We have our own opinions  Yeah, yeah  I don't like him  And how out of touch is he?  Listen to this quote  He goes  All of you in the media need to stop with this Ozzy Osbourne  This Ozzy Osbourne  He doesn't even know what it is  That's how he sounds 
[00:50:00]  Maybe Ozzy should be a better father  And then go out and bang some chick out of wedlock  And spend 40 grand a year to shut her up  Maybe that's what Ozzy should do  That's a good one  Maybe that's the messed-up Osbourne family  As a perfect  The Cosby family is obviously a lot better  You know, where you go and you have a kid  And you just, you know, keep it quiet  Keep it quiet  Yeah  Tells you blackmail Ozzy for money  Maybe Kelly should blackmail Ozzy for money and go to jail  Blackbells what?  I said blackmail  I said blackmail  I didn't say blackmail  Did I say blackmail?  There was a blackmail in there somewhere  Earl was standing right next to me 
[00:50:30]  It just kind of slipped out  I'm sorry, Huxtable  Earl, you can't possibly have something to say  Earl, what's your opinion on Bill Cosby  Thinking that the Osbournes, as he says here  Is a sad  This is a sad, sad family rule  Yeah  I don't think it's sad  I think it's honest  Right  The Osbournes is totally honest  You're going against Bill Cosby?  Yes  On this one?  I disagree with Mr. Cosby  Too bad Ozzy didn't have the integrity to hawk pudding pops 
[00:51:00]  Maybe then Ozzy would be a little bit better for America  If he wasn't just being a real family guy and selling pudding pops  Watch what a genius comedian does  Pryor sold pudding pops for a living, didn't he?  Oh, no way  He just put out brilliant albums  And his body  Try to put out his body at one point  The cake  The kids loved Jell-O pudding pops  And you know, Osbournes' child 
[00:51:30]  The daughter isn't like my little Rudy  Who was there  It wasn't your daughter, Bill  That family was fake, Bill  What an annoyance he is  And his self-righteousness is what bugs me  It's like, what do you care for?  How jealous are you that you're not being talked about anymore?  You're one of the biggest money makers on television ever  Shut your face and be happy  He got so lucky with the Cosby show  It is perfect time for it  It was a good show for the day  Everything right now  But you know what?  They're now watching the Osbournes  What's the problem with that? 
[00:52:00]  It's not sad  What's sad about seeing a real guy?  Ozzy doesn't abuse his family  They go to school  What's the problem?  Why are they sad?  They do have a very open...  Do they use the F word?  Oh, is that sad?  Because you don't use the F word on stage?  A very open relationship there  Did Ozzy ever slide his hand down the pants of some young woman  That came to Ozzy to learn about acting and whatnot?  Not to my knowledge, no  I don't think Ozzy has ever been accused of sexual harassment 
[00:52:30]  Remember that one?  Let me just put my hand down your pants there  This is great  It feels like a puddin' pop  I don't think Ozzy  This is our little secret  Look, the cause has the stinky pinky  The cause gave her the shocker  And I got the stinky pinky  You know what Ozzy should do maybe to be a little bit more wholesome  Is put out a really bad show where he stars as some detective  And then Ozzy can realize that 
[00:53:00]  Wow, man, nobody cares about me anymore  Because even I can't make this awful show work  Did he do the detective show after Cosby?  Oh, yeah  What was it called there?  What? Hold on, what?  Cosby Mysteries  Cosby Mysteries  Like two-hour movies  Was that before or after Leonard Part 6?  Oh, God  How about that?  How about his movies?  Ghost Dad  Or the devil in Max Devlin  Too bad Ozzy can't star in some floppy B films  Maybe then he'd be a little bit less sad to watch  The nerve of him just to be relevant for 30 years all over the world 
[00:53:30]  Well, that's what he sees  He sees Ozzy being talked about  And it's not him being talked about  So he gets a little upset  I'm just trying to find some  That elitist nonsense really bugs  Some of those  Yeah  See, now that was a wholesome show about  Stereotypical little Negro child  Playing in a junkyard  Look, look, Fatima's playing the radiator  Look at that 
[00:54:00]  He played it like an accordion  Now that's funny  I'm Dr. William H. Cosby Jr.  Doctor?  She took that honorary degree a little serious, didn't she, there?  I'm going to have a good time  Let's see what he's done  Since the Cosby show  If you're not careful, you may learn something  You may learn something  All right, we had the Cosby show in what, 1984? 
[00:54:30]  Start and then he did Leonard Part 6  Ghost Dad  Ozzy has had better movie appearances  Then he does his tribute things  Miles Davis, Ray Charles, tribute  Was he in Malcolm X?  Uncredited  Uncredited himself at End of Credits  So the guy kind of fell off the face of the earth there  After the Cosby show  He became irrelevant 
[00:55:00]  I still say he was a great comic  And the reason I make that distinction  Is because it's his self-righteousness that annoys me  Like, do you have to  How bad do you need attention  That the success of your show wasn't enough?  Why do you care?  He's played himself in everything since 1996, first of all  Yeah  Oh, the host of all  Who was the host of all?  What's my line or whatever?  The kids say the darndest things  No, no, there was another awful show  Like, stop, please don't shoot me 
[00:55:30]  What was the, um, what was the other show?  The, uh, what was the other, uh  I shut Norton up  Wow  He just looked at me, horrified, and stopped talking  I don't know what I, uh, man  I'm trying to regroup  What was the, uh, what was the, uh, Groucho Marx, uh, show he did  You bet your life 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, you bet your life  He was a Groucho Marx fan  I think he was tributing, quote-unquote  But it's amazing how ripping something off and tributing can be considered the same thing  I have the cigar and everything  Yeah, I may restart in the old, the old, uh, Jimmy Huxable  With all, well, I'm tributing  No, you're not, Jim  It's a tribute  You're stealing  And then the last thing he did, Cosby's show, a look back  So, perhaps he's just a little upset that he's not getting the attention  That this Ozzy Osbourne  He had a show on CBS for four years, too  It was on Monday nights  Did he? 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, on CBS  Well, why, why is that sad?  Yeah, but what was the name of that show?  That was awful  I think it was just called Cosby  Yeah  Yeah, he was a poor guy  No, he was  He was poor during that show  Was he?  Yeah  He was, uh, an unemployed guy  He got out of work  He was out of work  The Cosby Mix Mysteries  Oh, 96?  It was just called Cosby  Hilton Lucas is a man who was forced by his employer to retire  Hilton Lucas  His wife has trouble with him always being at home  Hey, Earl, why are you wearing the sunglasses?  It's about, they're prescription glasses 
[00:57:00]  Prescription sunglasses  Yes  All right  Why do you need them indoors?  I was  I don't know  I was about to go out  Where were you going to go?  Dwayne Reed  For what?  What are you getting?  Medicine  What's wrong with you?  No  No  What you got?  No, I just have to get a  The sickle?  You got the sickle?  Oddly enough, it is from, uh, my, uh, my blood count  Iron  Iron supplements  You got to get iron?  Oh, just eat spinach 
[00:57:30]  You don't have the sickle cell, do you?  No  No, nothing like that  Sickle cell  All right, we just watch around for a while  Who used to do the sickle cell telethons?  Oh, um  He used to come out and go, ring the bell for sickle cell  And they'd ring the bell when they wanted to go to the tote board  Ring the bell for sickle cell  It wasn't Lou Rawls  I think it was Lou Rawls  It might have been Lou Rawls, yeah  My lady, love  You'll never find  You'll never find  Sickle cells like mine 
[00:58:00]  Sills that will poke right through  The arteries like these do  Why?  He did, he raised a lot of money  Great cause  Great cause  All right, so there you have one  Well, there's another quote here  He goes, I'm telling you  The Osbournes is a sad thing  It's like laughing at Tiny Tim  It's the kind of entertainment that you look at but wouldn't want in your home 
[00:58:30]  And don't like to look at things like that  Yeah, this is the same self-righteous guy that got mad at the chick who did nine and a half weeks  When he got really pissed off at her cause she did something inappropriate and inconsistent with, I guess, the old Cosby tradition  Look, you know what the point of that quote is?  He referenced Tiny Tim  Here's how out of touch this guy is  Can he realize that perhaps he isn't the know-all of entertainment these days?  And the fact that the Osbournes is a very high-rated show 
[00:59:00]  It's on, what, is it MTV?  I never heard of MTV  A lot of these old-timers are pissed off that the reality programming has taken off  I have never seen the Osbournes on the Jack Parr show  Why is it wrong?  It should be maybe a little bit of a forced mugging  And a good-natured family ribbon  Right  Maybe that's whatever  But no, nobody wants to see that  Nobody  It's entertaining because the networks are formed  Just forced that, like, puke down our throats for so long 
[00:59:30]  People are sick of it  So now you see something real  And it's entertaining because people relate to it  Sorry, they don't relate to the doctor-lawyer-three-perfect-kids nonsense  Hey, Bill  This is Bill Cosby  Oh, what's the matter, Bill?  I would like to talk to you about some of the things that you say in your show  He's doing it, Eddie Murphy doing Bill Cosby  You can't say flim-flam, flim-flam, fart  Okay?  And I get kind of offended when you talk about the kind of stuff, alright? 
[01:00:00]  Right  I mean, isn't this supposed to be a family show?  What's your problem with the Osbournes, Bill?  Oh, well, I mean, you got Ozzy who can't even speak English regularly  But when he gets on the stage and he's all drug and deuce, he can sing like a mung-mung  Like a mung-mung  Exactly  I mean, I don't have anything against y'all exactly, but when you start dusting me on, you know, your radio show, I have a little bit of a problem  I never saw Theo wear no mohawk 
[01:00:30]  Or going around the house with a bayonet  See, that's just terrible  That's just terrible  Well, hold on, we got Ozzy calling in here  Ozzy  Hi guys, how are you guys?  Alright, what's the problem, Oz?  I don't know, you know, why are you so angry?  Because I don't go around my house going, you know, Rudy, you know, I don't know what the problem is  Now, there's nothing wrong with Rudy, she's a good little girl 
[01:01:00]  I do, we have a problem with my show for you, washed up, you know  I'm coming back from, you know, not selling too many records, like, oh, you're going to hit show, you know  Why, you just, you're going to leave me alone, you know  Well, for one thing, your daughter is a red-headed slut  She tried to sing and she can't do it  She makes a mockery of herself on, you know, TV, on MTV  Your daughter's name is Rudy  Now, that is a good African-American name 
[01:01:30]  What else do you want me to call my daughter?  Oh, I know  You got me, I was outside sitting by the pool drinking some, you know, cocktails  Hey Junior, can't you speak English?  He's speaking English, Coz, let her finish  These guys are going mad, you know  I'm just trying to enjoy my time before Osprez takes off again 
[01:02:00]  I hear Bill Cosby, you know, talking about me, you know, on radio  I have no idea what's going on  I want Bill to get a TV show that he can come talk to me  Well, you know, can you do me one favor, Ozzy?  Prison, foreign and filth  Can you say helicopter?  Helicopter  Oh my God, that's all I wanted to hear, everybody  I'll talk to y'all later  All right, Ozzy, I got to tell you, that's a fake Bill Cosby 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, we're sorry  I'm sorry, I put you through that  Oh, it's not really Bill Cosby  His impression got consistently worse  Well, I'm in this point in juncture  And my cigars have been stuffed with a little bit more  Yeah, you started off good  And you ended up sounding like the governor, George Wallace  How did that happen?  Yeah, I thought he had a little Sipowitz from NYPD Blue  Like, hitting him in there  All right, Bill, hang up  We've got to talk to Ozzy  All right now, y'all have a good evening  All right  I think I'm going to put something together called Cosfest

Joe Dildo  Joe get a better phone calls back  Yeah you can't hear us  Wow  Right now the daughter's like  Ow  Alright we're going to humor this guy and then we're going to move on  Steven what's up?  I wouldn't call myself famous but I've been in Austin Powers and I've been in Pulp Fiction 
[01:41:00]  Non-speaking role played the role of the gimp  See now this is very hard to believe  You understand that we might  I've got no reason to call in Julia Sweeney off of Saturday Night Live  Uh huh  She's my ex-wife  Really?  I don't know how you'd confirm this or deny it but  Where are you calling us from?  Calling you from Spokane, Washington  Washington  Yep  And you listen to the show  I was told to give you a call for random famous people but I am familiar with Opie and Anthony 
[01:41:30]  And you were married to?  Julia Sweeney she played It's Pat  Yeah do you got a credit on that?  Not to It's Pat to Pulp Fiction I do  Yeah  I was in Austin Powers I was the inept guard that got shoved into the lava pit  Oh yeah  Okay that's true  That's also the gimp?  That's both  It's myself  My real job is a writer for Tiny Toons 
[01:42:00]  Tiny Toons  Yeah the cartoon  Cause I'm looking I see Random Play  Yeah  Is listed on your credit as a writer?  Yeah  And so is It's Pat  As a writer  And boy  She was my wife  I did very little writing  I take no credit for that  And Boy Meets World  Yeah  Dude didn't that make like 60 grand at the box office It's Pat?  Well I got all my friends and relatives to go buy a ticket  Come on  We're not proud  Jim I'm very impressed with your filmography so far 
[01:42:30]  I mean Spider-Man has done many hundreds of millions of dollars  Not all of us are fine actors like you are  I'm not even ripping into it  I just admit it didn't get press or whatever  I'm not even ripping it  Okay  I never saw it  I've been in an episode of New Heart  I've never pursued it as a craft  I fell into the role of the gimp  And how did you get that role?  Bruce Willis is somewhat of a friend of mine  Really?  And when the movie started it was a small budget movie  It was nothing to film 
[01:43:00]  It was an afternoon's work for that character  The movie itself was not that highly promoted  It ended up being a huge cult hit though  And you were the gimp  Yep  Didn't say a word  Now why were you in that drawer?  I don't know  What was in the briefcase?  I don't know  Well you know something?  I'm buying it  I might be naive  But I'm kind of believing it  Alright well I have to ask you one question  This will at least help confirm  Where was that scene shot 
[01:43:30]  As well as most of the film?  I can't hear you  Say that again  Let's see if he knows  Where was that scene shot  As well as most of the film?  Jim?  Yes  Yeah  See?  It wasn't him  You're very good Jim  That's a good answer  Good question  Yeah I don't even care if he got me  I knew it wasn't him  Yeah  How did you know?  It was just too obscure  And the gimp is too well known a character  And he slipped up  Because he knew that I was Jim  And he said somebody called in  And told him to call in  And then the second letter  He's like  And Jim I'm impressed with you 
[01:44:00]  Having been in this  And he's saying he's calling  From Spokane, Washington  And someone called him to call in  He's like  You are Columbo  Yeah  That's good  Very nice  I let my guard down  I feel like an idiot for doing that  I let my guard down for a minute  You little angel  You're just asking  You know what?  Jesus  Give yourself up  Wait  Don't you dare be hard  I beat myself up a little  We wanted to believe Jim  Yeah  I wanted to believe  You don't  No no  You don't need to believe  We were there too  You don't need to believe  Because there's enough celebrities  That enjoy this show  Where you don't need phony balonies  Calling in  And forgive me for being so harsh

[01:46:30]  My six year old found like  One of those little silver bullet vibrators  And he comes walking up with it  And he's like what's this?  It's vibrating away in his hand  I'm like give me that thing  I'm like it's one of daddy's tools  Oh yeah one of daddy's tools  No it's for there when daddy's tool isn't  For there I stink  As long as he didn't put it in mayo  And try to make a sandwich with lettuce and tomato  Exactly  Hey Norton I always wanted to ask you this  You're my age 
[01:47:00]  And in the  Like I was in nursery school  A little boy asked me  Well she can't say  Hold on  Marianne  Can't say that  How long have you been listening to this show?  Hmm  About a year  A year and a half  You know we can't say that  You know that can't be said on the air  When you were in nursery school  Someone asked you  If you wanted to give them some yellow discipline  Right in the gullet  Yes  Okay  Where'd you go to nursery school?  In Yonkers  Oh unfortunately that was not me  I was in Edison  Oh okay 
[01:47:30]  Alright  What did you say by the way?  I said  No  What a team player you are  How bizarre  Like I was just like  Oh my god  No  Why couldn't you just help somebody out?

Right  Oh three  Yeah  Alright  Yeah  Alright  So okay  I was just curious  Alright thank you  If anybody called in saying  You know 
[01:48:00]  What did you do?  Alright Marianne  Thanks for slowing down the show  Have a good day  Bye  I got a great email in my hands  From a 16 year old female  Yes  She wanted to call the show yesterday  She did the snooping thing  And she couldn't call in to  Well she was calling in  But she couldn't get through to tell us what she found  Alright  Okay  So let me read this real fast  Hi there  I'm a 16 year old girl  Who's a fan of your show  I was listening to you on the way home  From my summer job yesterday  And caught part of the segment on snooping 
[01:48:30]  In your parents' drawers  As soon as I got home  I went upstairs to their room  And began snooping  Well let me tell you  It was instant pay dirt  In the form of a box  Sticking out from under the bed  This is what I found  She's got a little list  Yes  16 year old girl  Number one  Not one but two dills  A purple one called an eager beaver  Not only did it vibrate  But it rotates  And it has a beaver shaped stimulator  For her extra pleasure 
[01:49:00]  I think I've seen those things  Like  Yeah yeah  It moves around  And then right where  The man on the boat is  There's a little offshoot thing  Where it's a little beaver  Mmhmm  And it's sitting there  That vibrates  Sitting on a little log  Or something  Yeah yeah  A little log  The other was a standard  Flush color job  Straight vibrating  Nothing special  Except for the fact  That it was  Ten inches  No joke  Gross  Wow  Number two  She found this blue rubbery  Spike thing called  The wireless techno lover 
[01:49:30]  Wireless techno lover  This thing slides over the man's  You know what  And gives hours of vibrating pleasure  To you both  Or so the box says  Don't call her mom  It's safe to say  Your father is an inept zero  Three  A rubbery red thing  Called a cherry sleeve  Box said that the man  The man gets this thing ready  And slides it over his  You know what  And you know it's 
[01:50:00]  Well it's  Oh boy  Let me see  The guy uses it  To take care of himself  Oh  So he kind of  You know  Gets this thing ready  Puts it on  And then  It's like the thing  That Bronson found  In the guy's house  It's a sleeve  Yeah  The cherry sleeve  What do you use this for?  It's like  Get off  Oh that was great  What a great scene that was  What do you use this for?  The guy with the great cheeks  In Ten to Midnight  That was a good movie  What an ass on that guy 
[01:50:30]  Four  A thing called  The silver bullet  Yeah  It's a silver egg shaped thing  And it can change speeds  Looks well  And it looked used  She's saying Anthony  Number five  Some furry covered things  That I think you use  To tie someone up with  Not sure  And I really don't want to know  Number six  A thing called  A heart slapper  It's a leather paddle  With heart cutouts  I spent half of my  Younger childhood  Trying to avoid spankings  And now find out  That one of my parents  Actually likes them 
[01:51:00]  Words fail me  That's probably  You smack the ass with it  Then it leaves  A little red mark  Except for where the heart  Is cut out  On the slapper  So then that  Is a little  Right  On your butt there  A little heart  And then you just  Clever  Put some icing on it  A DV call  Two on one  Which is a  It's a gangbang video  I'm not sure what that is  But it doesn't look like  Something my dad would  Want me to see  And an unmarked video  That I did not have  The guts to put in  The tape player  I don't think I want to know  Oh boy  Please put that in 
[01:51:30]  We ought to have her call  When they're not home  And pop the video in  It's a good idea  Yeah  If she's listening  Maybe she could do that  For us  Yes  Eight  Pictures  Yes those instant picture  Things of my parents  I tried not to look  But I felt like  One of those people  That stares at an accident  Even though they don't  They want to look away  I am now officially scared  For my life  Number nine  She found pictures  Of her parents  And the act  Yeah  Oh man  Yeah  Number nine  Some book called the  And she spelled it  Kama Satra 
[01:52:00]  The Kama Sutra  Kama Satra  And another  How to manual type book  I'm so embarrassed  That my parents need books  To show them how  Other than a few magazines  Nothing else exciting  I could not get through  To you on the phones  When my parents come home  So I couldn't email you  Until this morning  I'm not sure  Whether to be horrified  At what I saw  Mad that I couldn't get through  On the phone  Or disappointed  That I might miss you  Talk about this  Unless it is between  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah  So she goes on and on  There you go  Wow  She couldn't get through  Yesterday  And the beautiful thing  Is that there's a specific list  Hopefully her parents 
[01:52:30]  Are listening  And as she's reading off the list  Like we have that  We have that  We have that  Wait a minute  Oh my god  And our daughter's 16  I never found sexual  The only thing I ever found once  Was a condom  In the toilet  That had obviously  Been discarded  Right  Abuse  Yeah  That scarred me horribly  Oof  Just knowing that they'd been in there  Enjoying each other  I was helping  Helping my father  Help one of his friends move  And I was a kid  You know  They pull the bed away 
[01:53:00]  It was his friend Jimmy  So he pulls the bed away  And behind it  Are just wrappers  For condoms  And those  They used to call them  Blue caps I guess  It was like a capsule  That you pop the top off of  And took this  Lamb skin  Sheath  Condom out of  Sheath  But it was  It was floating in fluid  The whole time  Oh wow  And there were those  Like strewn all over the place  And my father 
[01:53:30]  I just remember him saying  Hey quite a few blue caps  Down here  And they were like laughing  And I'm like  What's the joke  I don't get it  Because I don't know  What a blue cap is  I had no clue  And once you grow up  Those things hit you  Like oh  When you get a punch line  Like ten years later  Condoms and used condoms  It was just disgusting  Pat  Hey how you doing guys  Alright Pat  It's not a big part  But you guys remember

It's all you gotta do  Alright  It's easy  Anthony we have started making our Andrew Dice Clay prank calls  Yes  We have so many very cool Dice clips  From his various appearances and phone calls on this show  I do believe we started this soundboard phenomenon 
[01:58:00]  That is happening all over the place now  It's so much fun  It's all over the internet  People are making their own  Make their own calls  You could call anybody  If you have enough clips  You can answer any any situation that comes across on the phone  And we have plenty of Dice clips  So who's the first victim?  Our old friend Tom  Tom  Tom from New Orleans  Who got fired from the station we're on in New Orleans  Tom from New Orleans  So Rick decided to call him today  And mess with him with the Dice Clips 
[01:58:30]  Check this out  Hello it's Tom  Tommy  You got your money?  Tommy  Who's this?  Tony Slangini  Hey Tony  What time is it?  What time is it?  You tell me  Who is he to call up and look to start a problem?  You know between me and you?  You do a bad Andrew Dice-Click imitation  You sound like that idiot Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show  See that doesn't hurt me  That's like a nice thing for you to say  Why? 
[01:59:00]  Yeah everything's going on  You got issues sweetheart  Why are you talking now?  Why are you tongue tied?  I'm not tongue tied baby  You sound like Ant from the Opie and Anthony show  You got a boyfriend?  Yeah Opie he's a little fag  This is why there's so many problems in the world  Cause Opie's a fag?

I'm an idiot  You're a faggot  I'm a faggot  What got to him?  I think that Tom is  He's mad that we keep saying he got fired  Because he keeps trying to explain to me  That he left on his own terms  And all this crap  So I don't know  Oh he got fired  He got fired  He would have never left that station  He loved our show  He loved being there 
[02:00:30]  He was a star because of us down there  Maybe they said look  We want the station on 24 hours  And he said that's not happening  And he walked away  That's not happening here  How am I supposed to keep power  Going to this station  For this long  When you're a bunch of faggots  Maybe he officially left  Before he was going to get fired  That old  Forced  That old gag  Resignation  Happens all the time  In the business world  He told me that you know  He was our friend  And picked us up at the airport  And you guys  You know  Saying he got fired on there  But I mean 
[02:01:00]  I hadn't talked to him  Until this prank call today  That was the first time  I'd heard from him  No because when it was  All going down  He was so depressed  You could tell  That something was going on  He wasn't happy about  Maybe he did quit  Huh?  Maybe he did quit  Maybe  Tom what's going on?  Hey guys  How you doing?

[02:03:00]  It must sound  To say that  Your show is  Kicking our ass  In Jersey  Yeah  We own Jersey  Maybe it was a joke  We own Jersey  Like you wouldn't believe  Yeah but you know what  There are plenty of cities  We suck in  But I mean  No one  No one  Is more popular  Than us in Jersey  Maybe it was a joke  In this time slot  I should say  Maybe it was sarcasm  Because they're getting  Their asses kicked  And they're like  Ah because we were  Beating them up so bad  We're taking off  Like maybe they were  Acknowledged  Who knows  We don't even know  Who they are  You know I really  Should shut up  I'm psychoanalyzing

[02:05:00]  But there are real women here  And they're not representing  Worth anything  Well where's the  Remember the  A monster  Yeah where's the  A monster  Yeah we don't need her  This time  Alright  I don't think Buffalo  Should be too bummed  That they don't have  Any girls in the contest  Okay  Yeah don't worry about it  Buffalo  Even though college  Is out here  We do it  It is a big time  College city  And there were  Good looking women  There are still  Good looking women  Enjoy all the fine  Women from all over  The country  On opandanthony.com  Don't worry Buffalo  Alright

[02:20:30]  Stop doing that  Drugs  Whether they're  If you can't deal with smoking some pot  I couldn't deal with smoking weed anymore  That's what happened to me  I love my beer  I love some Captain Morgan and Coke  I love it  But pot  And Coke  Freaked me out  Captain Morgan and Coke  And Coke  No I don't  I don't do drugs  I don't like doing drugs  So I stopped doing them  They made me freak out a little bit  I was watching Grey Lady Down  Charlton Heston's submarine movie  Remember that  I don't remember 
[02:21:00]  The sub sank  And it was almost below  Hull crush depth  You know  And it was resting on a ledge  On the bottom of the ocean  And if it went over the ledge  It would have just  You know  And everyone dead  So it's just resting there  And they had to send a rescue  Little sub down  And hook up to the hatch  And it was a big involved movie  But the whole time  The whole thing of oxygen  And lighting  And claustrophobia  Was just  Taken over in this movie  I'm sitting in the  In the big cushy chair 
[02:21:30]  In the living room  And I'm watching  The movie  And I'm smoking weed  This movie is  The  The best  The best  Move  Oh  Another dude  Another dude  And I'm watching  Hacking  Like this is so cool 
[02:22:00]  Look how the sub is underwater  Like that looks really cool  Like a real underwater sub  Man  What do  What's that like  Being in a sub  It would probably be cool  You're like under the water  Yeah  So  I bet it's  I bet it's small in there  Probably like really tight  God 
[02:22:30]  Imagine being like  Stuck on the bottom  Of the ocean floor  And your  Oxygen runs out  And you're  So much water above you  And you think  You can't get rescued  How the hell  Oh my god  I'm having a panic attack  Oh my god  Alright what do I do  Oh my god  I'm freaking out  Put the joint down  Drink milk  One more  Alright I gotta get in the shower  Right now 
[02:23:00]  I don't know why  But I have to take a cold shower  With all my clothes on  That was the last time  You smoked pot  That was the last time  I smoked pot  I went into my bedroom  I laid in the bed  I curled up in the fetal position  And just sat there  With horrific  Horrific thoughts  Of what  It would feel like  If you were actually  In a submarine  That was being crushed  By the water  And running out of oxygen  And I  I just  After it wore off  I said to myself  You know something  I can't smoke pot  Oh well  Life's a bitch 
[02:23:30]  I enjoyed the weed  When I was having  A good time with it  But I really don't need  To deal with that  Situation again  So I stopped smoking the pot  And then I went to  What they call the cocaine  After that  And it's  Because that would help  At a sub  You know underneath the water  Well you know something  When you were snorting the cocaine  You really didn't get that anything  You could just get out  And lift the sub  Right  I will get out  I could hold my breath  And push the god damn  Submarine to the surface  And incidentally  And I'll paint it  On the way up  Being your  Hulk crush  You described every 
[02:24:00]  Submovie ever made  Oh of course I did  It could have been anything  Could have been  Operation Petticoach  It would have freaked me out  I didn't  It was the weed  That's what I'm saying  I can't deal with the weed  Look at Timmy  Timmy go ahead  Yo hey  Norton  I used to do a lot of coke  Right  And I would sit up  For like say  Six o'clock in the morning  In Playstation  Right  Shored out of my skull  Then I  You know  I straight myself out  I was like  Those bipolar  Mad depressant  When I did the coke  I used to get  You know like  Turtle pecker

[02:28:30]  The submarine thing  It wouldn't be  Completely ridiculous  But there'd always be  Like this little  Like  Where you'd be like  Oh wait  I don't know  I can't quite put my finger on it  But I'm not having as good a time  As I was having two minutes ago  But I really can't put my finger on it  Like I'm more nervous  And I'm just kind of like  You know  I don't know why  And that's freaking me out  So I just  I stopped doing it  So you graduated from that  On to the coke  That went to the coke  And that got to the point  Where it was just like 
[02:29:00]  You know  Not even a mental thing  It was just physically  This stuff will kill you  It just will kill you eventually  You can't sit there  With your heart  Redlining  Thinking that  You know  This is a good thing  You're trying to whack your back  When you're all coked out  It honestly  It's so awful  It's like just tugging on a baby's nose  A baby's nose  It's just little and awful  And it does nothing  That's the funniest thing  It is completely 
[02:29:30]  Picture getting out  Getting out of a cold pool  You have to hold it up  Remember when you're  You keep grabbing it  It keeps slipping out  Come here you little slippery fella  Remember when you go to the beach  Or something  It was cold  And you were a kid  And you'd get home  And you took your swimming trunks off  And it was just nothing there  Nothing  That is how it is with coke  But  Let me  I'll put in the but right now  I'll put in the but 
[02:30:00]  If you did get it going  You would  It would be  Just unstoppable  For the whole god damn night  I never could on coke man  No?  Oh it was awful  Yeah  It was almost like  You know how bad it is  When you're  When you're in the completely  Non  In the mood state  Right  And you're still pointing straight out  That's how you know  You have no blood flowing down there  It's gone beyond hanging 
[02:30:30]  Yeah it can't hang  It's gotten even smaller  Where now it's pulled back up  And it's pointing  It's just kind of looking out  Like the front of a ship  Oh that is really funny  Oh your bag's all tight  Everyone  Everyone that did that  Whenever I see people that I knew  Back then  And they're still doing it  You just gotta look and go  What  What are you insane?  There's a time in everyone's life  Where I believe  At some level 
[02:31:00]  Whatever you can handle  You should check out some stuff  Whether it's smoking a doom  You wanna do a little toot  But you gotta be sure of your own self  That you can deal with it  And the second you realize that  You know  Maybe this isn't the best thing  Maybe all my money is going to cocaine  You know  Maybe that's a problem  You gotta be able to stop doing it  Just realize it  But other people that can handle it  And have the means  Go ahead  Go to town  Have fun  Have fun 
[02:31:30]  Jay what's up?  What's up dude?  I'm sorry dude  I can tell you how to beat this  First of all  Second of all  I thought I was the biggest fad  Because I thought I was the only one  Who went through that  Do what?  I would smoke  I'd get paranoid  And I'd stop smoking for a long time  Yeah  The way to beat it is this  You drink  You drink most of the night  You hang out  You can't stop moving  And then you go out to the parking lot  You smoke  And then you drink some more  Dude that would make me puke  If I used to drink 
[02:32:00]  No  But you gotta pace yourself  Alright maybe  I would only have to vomit  It would make me light headed and dizzy  If I  I had to smoke first  And then drink to balance  But if I drank first and smoked  I was vomiting like an animal  Really?  See  I drink  I drink rum and coke  Then I go out  I just take a couple of toques  Come back in  Drink a little bit more  I just smell I  And in the club  I'm doing good  I'm alright  You know what makes you puke too man  When you're drinking  And then you give the guy  From Slap Happy a Hummer  Alright

[02:35:30]  And I turned on HBO  And what do they have  They have the truth  About Alex on  Is that the one  Where he was gay  Wait what's that  Was that the one  Where Alex was gay  Right  Remember he's a football player  Right  And like he goes to the bar  And gets it from the other guys  And the rest of the team  Finds out  Wasn't Scott Baio in that one  I never smoked pot again  After watching that stupid ass movie  What  Was Alex gay though  Or was  Was the guy  In the prison chaplain  Just winking at him  While they were singing  Religious songs  Alex was the star  I was a wandering ship 
[02:36:00]  Exactly  Hold alright  God that is so funny  Why would that movie  Freak this guy out?  I don't know  Touch off  Filthy hole you scum  And it's on  And I'm so high  And I'm like  Man why are people gay?  And I'm trying to like  Find  Like the meaning of life  And like trying to figure  Everything out  Like why  Why are  You know 
[02:36:30]  Why is this movie on HBO?  Why am I watching it?  Why am I this hot?  Right  You think too much  Right  If you're doing the weed  And you think too much  It'll freak you out  And every time  I would smoke pot  I'd think  And just  It would go one step  To the next  Until of course  You end up with like  Why are we here  On this planet?  Right  What happens  Mushrooms  What happens  When you die?  Remember  Where do you go?  Look at my thumb  I'm looking at my thumb  Don't ever do mushrooms 
[02:37:00]  And watch that movie  I'm bending my  I'm bending my thumb  It's the same thumb  That's gonna be on that corpse  When I die  Alright  Stop  And you sit there  And just  Does a bug feel it  When I cut it in half?  What would it be like  To be cut in half?  Could you see your guts  For a few seconds  Before the blood pressure  In your head drops enough  To shut your eyeballs off? 
[02:37:30]  I don't know  I'm thinking you'd see  Your intestines  For a second or two  Even though the horror  Wouldn't last long  Because you die  It would be some  Intense horror  Horror  For that second or two  That you see your guts  I think I'll switch to coke now  Well there's radio  There's edgy  There's psychotic  And then there's O&M  The Opie and Anthony show

[02:38:30]  Let's go to Barry  Barry  Hi Barry  Hi Barry  Come on man  People get the whole  You know you're on all these other stations  And they don't know  Right  It's a little inside for everybody else  Right  It makes us chuckle  We're just a radio guy  We're two guys with two different apartments  That's it  I don't want to go listen to all the message boards  Two different apartments  That's all it is  So I understand  Anthony was freaking out with the drug talk  Yeah I don't like all the drug talk anymore  Not good right  No  I get nostalgic 
[02:39:00]  Did you  Oh that just makes you sad  Seriously  I honestly think I might have one long weekend left of me  Do you  Yeah  I know I can't  I know I wouldn't  It's like I  I'm done  I wouldn't be able to  No  One last time  It's like dream week with baseball  We go back  You sure  We're a little older  We're moving slower  Hi Fez  Fez  Fez you're on the show  Hi Fezzy  Quit making fun of the way Ronnie talked  Right  I came down here to say that 
[02:39:30]  Hi Norton  Fezzy I'm here  I'm at the cool table with the hetero guys  I'll talk to you later alright  That's why I'm here  Oh  That's great  Take my books to geometry class  I'll see you later  I'm talking to the jocks now  Fantasy drug camp  Why not  I smell bit  Where one weekend  Everyone just  Mitchell Walters can actually host it  And take it away  Lock it up  Alright now we're going to go through chopping  Here we go  Where everyone just forgets about the 
[02:40:00]  Little commitment they made to stop doing the dope  Right  And we just buy a bunch of drugs  Seriously my heart feels stronger than ever  No  My heart used to actually feel like a pong machine  Just going back and forth  And I would lay there and just talk to Jesus constantly  If you get me through this  Everything's changing  I was just about to make a change  God damn it  Did you guys ever  Oh that's classic  Did you guys  One time  Doing asset  One time I actually ran away from the moon 
[02:40:30]  Just took off  Running as hard as I could  From the moon  Scared  F-less  As the moon came up  I just went  What the F  They're here  As I knew it would happen  You got monkeys  We're eating it  The moon  Oh I just turned his phone  I said we gotta get out of here  You gotta run  I'm grabbing people  Go come on  Follow me  Go go go go go  You gotta run  I know the way  Remember that story Brewer told about  He was in the parking lot of a concert  And he's walking around the parking lot with his friend  And his friend's like  Come here  You gotta find  And they're on acid 
[02:41:00]  And they're freaking out  And Brewer's like all paranoid  And his friend's like  No we gotta find a good spot  To smoke weed  Come with me  Come with me  And Brewer's like starts thinking  This is my buddy and everything  But where's he taking me  Right  And what does he want to do to me  Once we get there  He seems a little eager  And this is his whole mindset  Sure  And then as he's walking through the parking lot  His friend turns around  And goes  Come here man  What are you waiting for  And Brewer said he looked down  And there was an oil spot  In the parking lot from a car  That had been leaking oil  And he goes  That's what he's doing  He wants me to step into the darkness 
[02:41:30]  No it ain't happening  Because if I step into the darkness  I can't leave the darkness  The oil spot was the darkness  That his friend was leading  You wonder why people just kill their friends  Out of nowhere  We were doing acid  We had a great time  I had to stick a knife in his heart  And then you cut their eyeball out  And then you put a hose in there  Somehow that's gonna help  Because it cleans out the bad part of his brain  I was smoking dust one time  I'm walking home  And I have a personal pan pizza 
[02:42:00]  In my hand  And I'm a knick-knack right now  I'm no longer a human being  I'm a cartoon character  Right  I look down at a personal pan pizza  And I just freeze up  I'm scared going  How did I get so god damn big  I thought somehow on the walk  I had gotten so large  That this pizza  This large pizza  Had shrunk down in my huge hand  And I'm thinking  If I walk backwards 
[02:42:30]  Maybe I can undo  This horrible thing  And you know  I'm 15 at the time  And I'm thinking  How am I gonna explain to my parents  The size I've gotten  That's hilarious  Awful  One thing you never do  Is take acid  And then go see  Especially this was right when it came out  American Werewolf in London  Right  I was sitting there watching the scene  Where he changes into the werewolf  It was pretty good for the time 
[02:43:00]  There was no CGI  They had his snout coming out  And his feet  And he's screaming in pain  I was more horrified  Than any other time in my life  The sheer terror  And there's nothing you can do  Because your buddies are there  Sure  And I don't know if they're feeling the same way  But what are you gonna do  Run out of the theater screaming  Because they'll never let you live that down  I'd still be getting phone calls  Remember that time  Hold on  Yeah  Just keep it together  You are like  You're on a thread  Right  You're constantly on a thread 
[02:43:30]  Going  Just hold it together  Hold it together  Hold it  I'm gonna turn into this werewolf  Shut up  Get the bad thoughts out of my head  Right  Please  Shut up  Don't go there  Well we gotta step aside for these guys  Yes  Alright we'll keep the drug talk going  Yes Jimmy  Happy anniversary  I just gotta say  Happy one year anniversary  To the Yates family  It's one year ago today  I just wanted to throw out  A big  Happy anniversary  And you did that as part of the
