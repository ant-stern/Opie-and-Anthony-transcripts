<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion of Hallmark cards dealing with death and miscarriage, prompting exaggerated reactions and dark humor from the hosts.  A caller, "Inbred in Ohio," contributed a comedically cruel song about AIDS.  This morbid humor continued as the hosts dissected more Hallmark cards, focusing on their perceived awkwardness.  Comedians Bob Kelly and Colin Quinn joined the show in-studio, engaging in a back-and-forth of insults primarily targeting Bob Kelly's weight. Callers further fueled this comedic insult exchange.  The conversation shifted to a Six Flags accident, resulting in more off-color jokes. A significant portion of the show was dedicated to an absurd and repetitive singalong of "Chocolate Rain," with increasingly nonsensical lyrics contributed by the hosts and callers.

Anthony then recounted a basement flooding incident, jokingly referring to it as "chocolate rain," segueing into a call with Tom from White Plains, who detailed his serious lung disease and plans for suicide.  A lengthy, morbidly humorous conversation ensued, covering his illness, coping mechanisms, planned suicide method, medication, weight gain, and breathing difficulties.  The discussion then moved to the New York City steam pipe explosion and road closures, with a caller explaining the asbestos reason for the extensive closures.  Bill Burr joined the show in-studio, and the hosts, along with Burr, speculated, with dark humor, on whether pilot suicide caused the EgyptAir Flight 990 crash.  This led to a discussion about the perceived calm of pilots versus their dramatic movie portrayals. A flight attendant, Tammy, and a caller, Matt (who recounted an Air Jamaica engine failure), shared their aviation experiences.  The final segment focused on *Rock of Love with Bret Michaels*, with Burr discussing his reaction to the show, focusing on Tiffany, an unattractive contestant who persistently tried to enter the house. Clips of Tiffany's outrageous behavior were played, showcasing her vulgar language.  The hosts and Burr also discussed phone sex segments, fights, and the overall phenomenon of such reality shows. The show concluded with a humorous segment on using a rotary phone, contrasting it with modern technology and incorporating dark humor about the Cold War.

A subsequent segment began with Steve from Orange County participating in "Wake Up Your Spouse," using a blowtorch to wake his wife (resulting in a brief audio exchange). The hosts discussed the absurdity and potential escalation, humorously suggesting it could have ended in murder.  Swanson then woke his twelve-year-old brother by screaming. The show then shifted to a discussion about classic films that haven't aged well (*Scarface*, *Rocky*), leading to a discussion about a rumored bestiality scene cut from a *Planet of the Apes* remake. The majority of this segment focused on reports of "Monkey Man" attacking people in India.  Initially skeptical, the hosts delved into exaggerated accounts of the attacks, with callers adding their humorous suggestions on dealing with the creature.  The discussion concluded with speculation about Monkey Man's origins and potential implications, including absurd hypothetical scenarios. The hosts noted phone lines malfunctioning, humorously blaming Monkey Man.  Throughout the segment, highly offensive language and humor, including sexual, violent, and racist jokes, were used.  Chaz Palminteri was mentioned as a guest.

[00:00:00]  K-Rock  This morning, Opie and Anthony show. Tune in. That is all.  I need you for a K-Rock. 
[00:00:30]  WXRK New York  92.3 K-Rock  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York 
[00:01:00]  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York 
[00:01:30]  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  WXRK New York  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You're listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst.  It's absolutely awful. 
[00:05:00]  If you're going to get into one of these touchy subjects, get a card that's blank inside and  write a little note.  Some stationery.  Buy some stationery. 
[00:05:30]  But you need Hallmark to find the worst to show your sympathy because your friend has  cancer.  It's kind of a cop-out.  It's kind of a cop-out.  Oh, no.  The cancer section.  Nah, this one doesn't quite do it.  How big is that, too?  It's not like Mother's Day on that section where it's real big.  I'm sure it's just like a little section.  It's hiding card.  It's hiding in the shadows.  Yeah.  Are those cards all together under some kind of special...  Who bought them all?  You know, that's what we've got to figure out.  Where are the cancer cards?  What are the cards right next to the cancer cards? 
[00:06:00]  Is it the gay card?  Are they all like special interest cards all in one?  Gay cards right next to Happy Anniversary.  Miscarriage cards right next to You're Expecting.  You don't want the miscarriage card next to the one first year card.  The card that's shaped like the number one with a candle on it.  Dude, can we go down to the store and rearrange the cards?  I want the miscarriage cards right next to the birthday cards announcing that you're  first birthday. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, that's horrid.  Travai?  Hold on, hold on.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  I was only joking.  See, now it's okay.  Still.  Yeah.  What's up, Travis?  Travis?  Yes.  These cards, now, where were they?  They were in a section all by themselves.  All by themselves.  Yes.  And were they prominently displayed?  No, they were actually in the back of the store. 
[00:07:00]  In the back of the store.  Yeah, because they don't want these cards creeping anyone out.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be happy stuff when you're buying cards.  Did you ever go to the back of a store to like the far corner and see the crap they  got there?  Garbage.  They haven't been able to get rid of.  If you know anything about marketing, all the really good stuff is right there when  you enter a store.  Yeah.  But if you want to have fun, go to the back of these stores and look in the far corners.  I saw a show once where they were talking about supermarkets.  And you don't even realize how cutthroat that business is. 
[00:07:30]  The guys that supply like Del Monte and the name brand groceries, they will fight with other  people for shelf space, that's at eye level.  The eye level shelf space, that's your prime real estate in supermarkets.  And there have been like payola issues in supermarkets where the suppliers actually kick  back money to the supermarket to have that placement.  Where's the John Jeff section?  Oh.  Way low? 
[00:08:00]  The lowest shelf?  That's like the lowest shelf that's real thin too.  It's like only like six inches high so you can't even see it, never mind reach for it.  It's like where the Goya beans are.  And we don't feel like explaining the John Jeff thing to me.  On the floor.  We'll explain on another day for the newbies.  How do you find a car?  I'm sorry your son is gay and the host of an awful show.  That's going to be a great hallmark.  Enjoy your trip to Thailand.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Inbred in Ohio. 
[00:08:30]  Inbred.  Hey, what's up, y'all?  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up, Inbred?  Hey, uh, instead of a corporate gaze, how about a singing telegram?  You have AIDS.  You have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS.  You've got the AIDS.  You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here.  Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here.  It isn't clear, but what we're certain of is you have AIDS.  Yes, you have AIDS.  Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS. 
[00:09:00]  Be sure that you see that this is not HIV.  But full-blown AIDS.  Not HIV, but really full-blown AIDS.  I'm sorry.  I wish it was something less serious.  Party's AIDS.  You've got the AIDS. 
[00:09:30]  All right.  That's a fantastic song.  I love that one.  Jimmy, you want to pick another card?  These are the brand-new Hallmark cards.  Oh, I don't know.  Real cards.  Pick a card, any card.  There you go.  This one can't be good.  These cards are just uncomfortable for everybody.  Why would you send this card, Dan? 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  Yeah, it should be just personal drop-by with some cookies and cake.  Well, certainly not Similac.  This is a light purple card.  Any picture on the cover?  Let me put the cover there.  It's like a little dark purple, like, flower outline.  Yeah, it's like an outline of a flower with this blue, like, almost light at the top where  the petals are.  Yeah.  And here's what it says. 
[00:10:30]  It is difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel.  For the child?  How about three inches of toilet water?  Oh, how's that for a depth?  I was only joking.  All right, it's okay.  I was only joking.  All right, it's okay.  Oh, they mean by depth, they mean the sorrow.  Okay, I'm sorry.  I was only joking.  I don't want to read this one.  For the depth of the loss we feel, for the child who will never be born. 
[00:11:00]  Oh.  You would actually send this card to somebody?  Or are you sending these cards out to everybody?  That's horrible.  The poor parents are, like, you know, going through a tough time, and that's got to come  in the mail?  Oh, what did I get?  A little card?  Oh, this might take my mind off of...  Ah!  Usually, when you go to your mailbox, and right around your birthday...  Yeah.  ...or Christmas, and you see what's obvious, a greeting card, you get more excited inside.  Hey, what's this?  You want to open up cards and read this crap? 
[00:11:30]  No.  There's work.  It says, uh, it's difficult for others to understand the depth of the loss we feel for  a child who will never be born.  And it says, uh, even those closest to us may wonder why we can't seem to get over it.  But with lovely friends.  Really?  Jesus.  Get over it.  Uh, what they don't understand...  This is, you open the card, and it's, like, a light, uh, turquoise inside.  What they don't understand is how we already...  Oh.  How we what?  Let's move on from this bit.  Ah.  That's a good one. 
[00:12:00]  Go ahead, Jimmy.  This needs to be read today.  What is Hallmark doing?  They need money this bad that they got cards like this?  What they don't understand is how we already loved that little one.  Aw.  And love never ends.  Oh, I didn't know it was an audio card.  You open it up, and it's an audio card?  Yeah, it's the thing of the future.  They put a chip in there.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  Though the dreams and plans we had must be gently laid to rest, we each must take our 
[00:12:30]  own time and, in our own way, find the strength to let hope be a part of us once again.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right now.  If you need someone to talk to, I'm here.  That is twisted.  Twisted.  I was only joking. 
[00:13:00]  Halfway rebounds.  Good.  No.  No.  Oh, my.  I'll tell you something.  How did that not go in?  Oh, Jesus.  We came up with a new way to use that clip.  Oh, no.  What?  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  It's just a joke. 
[00:13:30]  You guys can understand.  It's just a joke.  I was only joking.  There you go.  All right.  It's fine.  Oh, my God.  The...  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  The devil.  I was only joking. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, wait a minute.  Okay.  Here it is.  The final mix.  No, it's not the final mix.  The second.  Hold on in.  Not the final mix.  I'll help you.  After the drum thing.  Give it to me.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:14:30]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  It's all right.  It's just.  Oh, brother.  Look, the point is. 
[00:15:00]  What is the point?  The point is.  There's no point to this.  Look, we'll agree to disagree.  Okay.  Let's just agree to disagree.  We'll agree to disagree.  We're really pissing off some people right now, and I don't blame them.  It's just.  But the reality is, why?  What?  I'm just looking.  That's just.  Okay.  Well, let's see.  All right.  Oh.  Ah.  Ah!  Ah! 
[00:15:30]  Ah...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I hate you.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, we're only joking.  It's just a joke. 
[00:16:00]  All right.  All right, listen.  All right, listen.  I just wanted to mix it up a little bit, sorry.  I just...  Whatever.  Oh! 
[00:16:30]  You're going to be okay!  All right, look.  Let's...  I'm glad to direct this.  It's going to go.  All right.  Am I in on this one?  Yes, you are.  All right.  Okay.  Ah! 
[00:17:00]  You're fired.  You're not suspended.  You're not on temporary leave.  I think you're fired.  All right, listen.  It's all Hallmark's fault.  Oh, wait, wait.  I was only joking.  All right.  I was only joking.  It's a joke.  It's fine.  The point is...  That Hallmark is the twisted one here. 
[00:17:30]  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  They actually have cards for these...  Yeah.  ...these awful things.  All right.  All right.  All right.  How about we pick another?  I don't want to.  All right.  All right.  Well, maybe we should get rid of the other card.  Yeah, that's true.  John did want more sound effects.  Well, he got his sound effects.  There you go, Johnny boy. 
[00:18:00]  All right.  Can we just...  Can I read this one really fast just to get rid of it?  Get it out of the way?  Get throw away?  Yeah, get this one out of the way.  Throw this one in the garbage with the other one.  Just clear the list.  All right.  It says,  I have known you in my dreams, little one,  and there you will forever be loved.  Saying goodbye to what might have been  the hopes and dreams that grew more real every day  brings in added sadness in the depth of pain,  wishing you gentle comfort for your sorrow. 
[00:18:30]  Holy crap.  So that ends that subject.  There's a card for that.  Thanks to Hallmark.  All right, Anthony.  I got a couple more to choose from.  Fantastic.  Listen.  Listen.  Okay, listen.  I see the last three here.  Okay, listen.  Listen.  No, no.  Kidding.  All right, listen.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  We really want a lot of listeners to our radio show.  But if you're a female,  I got a suggestion for you. 
[00:19:00]  Wake up!  You might want to go somewhere else  for another minute or two.  Because the last three are a doozy.  Boy, I wonder what the pink card is.  Here you go, Ed.  Here you go, Ed.  I was only joking. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  Only joking.  All right, why don't you pick one?  Let me pick a new one.  Thank God we only have three of these  Hallmark cards.  Three letters left.  All right.  I'm picking this one.  Oh, Christ.  No.  You picked the pink one.  Why did I have to pick the pink one?  Women.  Women.  Women.  Women.  Wake up!  Okay.  Move on.  There's nothing to see here right now.  Move on. 
[00:20:00]  Just move on.  Please leave.  We're telling you to leave.  Kiss my fat ass!  No, we're telling you to leave right now.  All right.  It's a pink card?  It's a pink card, yes.  We'll save the other two for later in the show.  Because we can't.  All right.  This is a real Hallmark card, by the way.  Because people are writing going,  you guys are making these up.  No, you can go to your card store  and find these exact cards.  This collection is called Journeys.  It's encouraging words along life's way. 
[00:20:30]  Okay.  So, you know, life does throw you those curveballs.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Do they have one for that?  I have them, but they curve.  You're a fighter, a survivor, an inspiration.  Oh, no.  And this is kind of ironic.  Keep that close to your heart now and always.  Since something else isn't close to your heart anymore. 
[00:21:00]  I was only joking.  Is that all the card says?  Yeah, that's it.  It's a simple...  It obviously is for breast cancer.  It's got the pink...  Very subdued on the pink card.  You can see the pink ribbon.  That is the sign of support.  I, uh...  Sorry. 
[00:21:30]  Can't think of anything funny.  No, boy.  Funny just slips by me on this.  Yep.  You know, my pop-up card idea is just going to go by the wayside.  You can't hear the pop-up.  The card is very lopsided.  Oh, it's not.  It's perfectly even both sides.  Look at it closely.  No, man.  You can't even put that one on your mantle.  It keeps falling over.  You know how you got to give it to the person?  Like this. 
[00:22:00]  All right, listen.  Only this part.  All right, listen.  Let's leave.  All right, listen.  I was only joking.  Okay, it's all right.  It's just a joke.  Oh, sorry.  Everything's good now.  I try to put it back together.  All right, listen.  Half a card.  That is horrible.  Well, um...  Well, we got two more cards left.  Have one for crying husband. 
[00:22:30]  We have two cards left.  Yes, two cards left.  Thank God.  That we'll get to after the break.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, God.  That's horrible.  You can't...  Oh, my God.  People are making up their own cards, and they're really awful.  Yeah, well, it's, um...  There's other stuff to do, too, but I forgot already.  What, what, what?  What do you got?  This one says, um...  It's a sympathy card.  All right.  It says, uh...  In deepest sympathy, I'm sorry to hear your daughter... 
[00:23:00]  A...  A...  A negro.  I thought the beep took care of...  A...  Isn't it...  You open a card.  It's a pop-up card.  You open it, and there's, like, a nice suburban house,  and a black python just falls out of the daughter's window on the card.  Isn't it an audio card?  Don't you have the audio of that card there, Anthony?  Oh.  You might...  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[00:23:30]  No, that ain't it.  No, that ain't it.  Do you have the audio?  Of course I do.  Or the audio card of the card you just read?  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain.  Wasting your time with a black...  Huh.  A negro.  Oh, my God.  Anyone else see Jim Carrey doing the David Caruso bit on Letterman?  Like, six months after the whole world did the bit?  Hello, exactly! 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  How does he get away with that?  And everyone's laughing and laughing and laughing like it hasn't been done by pretty much everybody at this point.  I mean, everybody, and he walks on to Letterman with the glasses and does the whole David Caruso one-liner bit.  Yeah, it's pretty, um, pretty, uh, hack now.  It's one of the videos that is, uh, is one of the top videos on, I think, YouTube.  Sweeping the nation.  All right, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots to do today, so get us out of here for a bit.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:24:30]  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan.  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Hello, kitties.  I like calling our listeners kitties. 
[00:25:00]  I don't.  Hi.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  That's fine.  Hi, kitties.  You know, it's kind of like it's ultra hip.  That's really not hip at all.  Oh, really?  Kitties.  Hello, d***s.  I want to say folks.  Hello, folks.  Wait, you don't know where that L fits in.  Hi, folks.  Hello, dudes and dudettes.  Douche.  How about this one?  You want me to update it?  Go ahead.  What's up, bitches?  I like that.  All right.  It's hip and urban.  It's the worst of.  We're like taking a day off. 
[00:25:30]  Don't worry about it, though.  We got some great stuff for you.  This first bit, right off the bat, we got Bob Kelly and Colin Quinn in the studio, and  it's an all-out ball busting.  Colin, Bob, and Norton going at it.  Uh-huh.  That's all you need to know.  Check it out on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Lots going on today.  We got Bob Kelly, who's now on the couch.  Ha-ha!  You got your face.  We moved him over Carson style.  Yeah, for a huge superstar.  That's right.  Colin Quinn.  Colin.  I get a straight shot at Opie now.  This is what I like. 
[00:26:00]  He got slammed before the show even started, before the show came back from break, because  Colin was coming in, and we told Bob, look, you're going to have to go to the couch, because  Colin's coming up to the mic.  It's like Carson, you know.  Well, Kenny said that.  A new guy comes in.  So then he had to move to the couch.  So then Bob tried to get you, Colin.  He sits down on the couch.  He goes, why don't you put Fatso on the couch?  And without missing a beat, Jimmy goes, we just did.  Let's be honest, guys.  That's hysterical.  Let's be honest, Colin put on a few pounds. 
[00:26:30]  I put on a few.  Yeah, of course I did, but I'm a person that got fat.  I'm not a person that is fat.  Bob should be like, you're throwing a spear at a whale.  Manitoba.  You look like my Aunt Peggy, Fatso.  Aunt.  Aunt.  You look like a middle-aged housewife.  Colin looks the same as you did when I saw him.  He's whipping huskies on a sled right now.  What's the size of his head?  Look at your head.  At least I have my hair left. 
[00:27:00]  You look like a fat mosque in Iraq.  The Syrian surgeon's going to blow up the mosque.  You look like the Queen of England.  You know what I love about this?  Colin has your number.  Oh.  He has your number.  He has a lot built up, let me tell you.  He has a lot built up.  I will just say that Bob can be pretty, pretty brutal.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, yeah.  We've seen it.  Not necessarily amusing. 
[00:27:30]  But just brutal.  No, yeah, Bob's the guy that goes too far.  Like you had no filter guy on here.  He's the greatest.  Hey, Stephen has the greatest.  He's the greatest Bollywood uncle in the Bollywood musical.  Bollywood.  Stephen asks from Bayshore,  Will Bob be appearing anywhere at Mohegan Sun besides in front of the buffet?  Winn's not like Voss where he's going to throw a stinker.  He's just going to have nine of them.  He sounds like them.  He mumbles like them.  At Mohegan Sun, don't get upset when you walk by and hear people go, 
[00:28:00]  Tatonka.  Tatonka.  Why is everybody beating up on Bob?  Yeah, we might.  Why do you think?  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're enjoying it more than anyone.  You're the worst.  Yeah, but that's Jimmy's paws because he's got a good one coming.  I like it.  Also, from someone's cell phone,  Man Cow, the official radio show of the Lewis and Clark Trail.  That's very, very good.  He's in all these cities that are just like,  they were hot spots in 1850. 
[00:28:30]  He's in Deadwood.  When the gold rush was happening.  It's great.  Yeah, I'll be up in the Pacific Northwest.  Trying to find a new route.  Hey, let's say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's going on?  How are you doing?  Good.  Bob, I was going to go to breakfast on Wednesday, Newark Airport.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you, buddy.  How are you doing, man?  Good, buddy.  Did your credit card company call up and think it was stolen?  I actually was having, I was having a really nice breakfast. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  I was having, tell them what I was having.  Here's the deal.  We only got 45 minutes left on this side of the show.  Right.  I got this huge breakfast plate and it cost me $7 with the tax and the tip and the coffee  and the juice and the whole thing.  So I went to the guy at the front.  I said, I want to buy this guy breakfast.  So I take out a $10 bill of figure and it actually covered.  It was like $18 to get me a coffee.  Was it $18?  I ordered fruit, cottage cheese. 
[00:29:30]  I ordered like a couple eggs over here.  I ordered like a special type of dietary meal.  That's a dietary meal.  It was taking up the whole hour over there.  Yeah.  Thanks for the nice gesture.  I hope I see you at the airport again.  I'm going to throw eggs at your face.  Another instant feedback from Gutshot Drew.  The morning hole has dirty.  We were talking about Eric and Kathy up in Chicago, just wrapping that talk up.  The morning hole has dirty, dirty thoughts about pseudo overaggressive tank while she's 
[00:30:00]  bedding her hen-pecked, whipped husband.  Yep.  The fake husband.  Colin, you've done those radio shows, right?  Yeah.  I've done them all.  The guy and the girl.  They act like they're a couple for some reason.  Six seats out of the show.  Yeah.  I thought they were a couple.  I don't even think I was invited on Eric and Kathy.  Yeah, they act like they're married and a couple and then the guy'll say something.  I find that when me and the other sucker moms are driving our minivans, we like to have  something we can identify with.  You like listening to that and go, oh, this is good. 
[00:30:30]  And it teaches you how to get along and suffer silently from your awful marriage.  You know what I mean?  And you don't drive the minivans into the side of the school or anything.  The guy talks about mowing the lawn and she goes, oh, and you always do it wrong.  Well, hon, why don't you get out there and give it a try, you f***ing cow.  Oh, gosh.  Right now, I feel it.  Just wait for one of those shows to snap.  That would be just the best.  I feel like I'm in the basement with my five uncles when they used to make me just sit  there and get them beers and open them. 
[00:31:00]  All right, what else would they make you do?  Yeah.  The couch has a mood swing.  I'll tell you why, too.  If you want an analysis of Bob, now that it's not beat up on Bob Day, it's just Bob's  dream is, which I figured out, is to be like a guy, like a Budweiser commercial.  They have a bunch of friends and they sit around and have a few laughs on the weekend.  He wants to live that Eric and Kathy life.  Really?  Yep.  But he's so twisted.  But he doesn't realize, like, after six years, a high neighbor and his neighbor's  no one's going to accidentally run over, like, his seed feeder or something. 
[00:31:30]  And then the next day, the guy's got, like, pruning shears in his eye and Bob turns  on him.  You don't think Bob could make a good neighbor?  Yeah.  We'll live off for a while, but then, yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  Like, talking over the hedge to his neighbor.  Right.  And then after a little while, like, one thing goes a little wrong.  Yeah.  And Bob just loses his mind.  Yeah, because Bob realizes it's not his family.  He's in a house and kills his family.  Yeah, he'd love, like, all of us, like, all of us to be over at each other's house and  laugh and watch his watch and watch his watch and watch his watch and watch his watch. 
[00:32:00]  Hey, I hope the ladies let us get away with this.  What's wrong with having friends?  Oh, no.  I hope the wives don't hear us down here.  That'll ruin the fun.  What's wrong with it is you want to live the American dream and you're not fit for it.  That's all.  On two levels.  You actually look like you lost weight.  I'm not teething.  You think I'm really going into that softball?  Don't fall for it.  You think?  I may be taking a pounding, Norm, but I'm not that stupid. 
[00:32:30]  That's right.  What kind of you look like a little...  Norm, don't you insult me.  How fat is he?  I'm not even kidding.  You look like you lost weight.  I'm not even...  Shut up, you lying body stocking bills.  You really do look like an unfinished clone.  I was just trying to be helpful.  Oh, damn.  That's how it goes.  That's how it goes.  Larva.  So shut up.  Norton reminds me of Larva, and I don't know what that looks like, but it's just a name.  Larva.  It looks like he's James Larva Norton.  He looks like he should be eating his way out of an apple. 
[00:33:00]  God damn.  Oh, you are hurtful.  I'm just sitting there being hurtful.  I can't just give his friend a compliment.  I know.  He tried to help him.  He tried to pick him up out of the dumps.  That's exactly what he would do to that neighbor, too.  I have no doubt that he's psychotic, this one.  Oh, yeah.  When it comes right down to it, Bob Kelly will get some things done.  His neighbor would look over the hedge, and Bob's walking away, and then, like, he sees  below Bob's head, Bob's nude and covered in blood. 
[00:33:30]  Hey, Tim.  That's funny.  Hey, what happened?  Just that awful ass and his stupid feet pointing out to balance out the rest of that.  Bob nude looks like a fat Vanessa Manila.  Oh, are you ready for the update, finally?  Oh, the update.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Remember the girl at Six Flags? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, the one that lost her feet.  Yes.  Good update.  Did you hear this story?  No.  Haven't read a newspaper, huh?  Well, you haven't been out on the road.  I look at the local paper.  What's the bad neighborhood?  Ah, where do the gays hang out?  I really hit him at the show that night.  Hey, this guy's from Spurling Town, ladies and gentlemen.  You know where to go after the show.  That's true.  Colin's not above puffing a cigar through a hole. 
[00:34:30]  His feet got cut off.  It was a great...  Six Flags and Kentucky, and she was on a ride, and both of her feet got ripped off.  It was a superman ride.  Why don't you lend her two of yours, Caterpillar?  Money to spare.  Yeah, yours just grow back.  And you would love to know how to get ripped off.  Yeah.  All right.  She was on this Superman ride where they sit in this circular thing, and their feet dangle 
[00:35:00]  over the edge, and it gets lifted up to about 250 feet, and then kind of free falls  until you're about 20 feet from the ground, and then, you know, the brakes come on.  Right.  And they hoisted them up to 250 feet, and this cable kind of snapped and actually wrapped  around her feet.  Oh, my God.  And ripped her feet off.  Oh!  Both feet.  That's both feet.  She lived?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And both feet just kind of tumbled 250 feet to the ground, which I always think is the  reason, like, they could reattach it until it hits the ground, and then you got two 
[00:35:30]  broken feet.  Why do I feel like if you weren't doing this, you'd be one of those carnival ride operators,  Anthony?  Yeah, I could be.  You got that look about you.  I got that, you know.  Hey, come on.  From Pachahog.  I know.  Give the cute girls a free ride that is, like, 14-year-old girls.  Hey, you're cute, girls.  Go out later.  Eh.  No, I love it.  What's wrong with a few statutory rape charges in various cities that this roving carnival  goes to?  They'll never catch me. 
[00:36:00]  I told you, Opie, uh, Anthony's brother beat up my cousin one time.  Yeah.  Really?  Years ago.  Really?  Years ago.  In Pachahog or in the...  Wait, Joe did?  Somewhere.  Yeah, I think...  One of these co-billy towns.  One of those from Iceland or somewhere.  Yeah.  He gave my cousin a nice thumping...  A little south thrashing.  For what reason?  I think he was being a dick.  He might...  Well, of course, that's your family's, uh, side of the story.  It was the Irish against the Italian.  It had to, uh, it had to go down.  Really?  Yeah.  I never heard of that one.  Yeah, there was something going on there, and Joe had to pummel him. 
[00:36:30]  That's all right.  Later, my, uh, mother decided she had to move us to a cheaper place, so we moved to Central  Iceland.  Ooh!  Which I just, yeah.  Then I got my ass kicked.  Yeah.  Constantly.  Give me 50 cent.  That's what I heard every day.  Give me 50 cent.  Like, okay, please don't...  You give it to him?  I have to.  No, you don't.  You stand up for yourself.  It's prison.  You're saying no.  I was in elementary prison.  That's what I was in.  I was in elementary prison. 
[00:37:00]  This guy is hardcore.  Oh!  You have to give him the money.  Jesus.  You gotta give him the 50 cents.  You can't just give him sexual favors like you.  I wouldn't have minded that.  I have a better idea than 50 cents.  I wouldn't have minded that a baby body wasn't nervously shifting his feet while he said  it.  No, my leg.  Shut up.  Tall baby body.  His knee is still heeling.  Good.  That's right.  As soon as it heals, I want to smash it with a skull.  As soon as it heals, he's scheduled to be slaughtered by a Cambodian village ritually. 
[00:37:30]  That's right, Brando.  You heard him.  I heard him.  He really has got some good ones.  I wish you didn't tell him I was going to be in.  He's up all night writing.  Are you an assassin, Willard?  All right.  Well, we got the update on the feet girl.  Yeah, let's hear about her.  Feet girl update.  The girl whose feet were severed while riding on this Six Flags Ride in Kentucky is now  in stable condition.  Wobbly condition.  Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where 13-year-old Caitlin Lasseter is being treated, 
[00:38:00]  hospital management said the parents of Caitlin Lasseter would like to acknowledge everyone  across the country that have been supporting their daughter with many positive thoughts and  prayers over the last six days.  Did they reattach their feet or not?  They haven't said, and they won't say.  They said, uh...  How are you going to reattach their feet?  I don't know.  They gathered them up and took them to the hospital.  Procedure?  I don't know.  Some type of microsurgery?  I think...  Imagine with a needle and thread. 
[00:38:30]  With a glue and a hot gun.  Hot glue gun.  Just gray dead feet.  Oh, they're going to look awful.  Frankenfeet.  Pointing left.  I want to put them on backwards just to be silly.  You can make money over it.  What'd you say?  The freak show.  Caitlin's parents would like to state for the record that despite claims in the media  by representatives from Kentucky Kingdom Theme Park, at no time has any representative 
[00:39:00]  of the theme park been in touch with members of the family.  That prompted Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom to release this statement.  Representatives from Kentucky Kingdom traveled to the hospital immediately following  the accident and were there for some time before the family requested that they leave.  We are deeply saddened by this incident and, of course, have genuine concern for the well-being  of the entire family.  Yeah, that means the lawyer was like, get him out of here.  Exactly.  Get him out of here, you're going to mess up the case.  Don't screw up the case.  We've got a good one here. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'd lose a couple feet for that type of money.  Would you?  A couple pounds.  Thanks, Ed.  Deserve more than a thousand.  I was thinking very good.  I'm not saying it was a prior bit, but it was just on climbing alone.  That was his knee laughing.  It was his feet.  It just wasn't good enough for that setup.  That was the problem.  Yeah.  Oh, dear Bob.  He's already almost crushed his knees with that damn thing.  Now his feet are going to go in.  It's like, oh, I just tease Bob.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  It's like an avalanche onto a tent when he walks.  I can't just be bash Bob, Jay.  You're right, Adam.  Yeah, let's drop that.  He turned on me, Bob, and he turned on me.  I had to do something, Jim.  Bob looks hurt.  No, I'm good.  Are you hurt?  I'm liking it.  I think Jim was actually complimenting you when he said, I think you lost some weight.  I actually thought he did lose a few pounds.  I didn't like him.  How would you think Colin lost a few or gained a few?  Colin looks the same.  Colin looks the same as he did last time his mom.  The same as what?  An elephant?  No.  He doesn't look any heavy.  What was that?  He doesn't even have a receding hairline.  His head just got so fat. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my God.  That's pretty hurtful.  Wow.  There's no need for that.  That's uncalled for from the alley.  From the Iranian Kevin James.  It really hurts.  Very fat, kinkish, sutherland.  Oh, you want to go for the oldies?  All right.  All right, Margaret show.  And the worst thing is we can't even see each other's faces.  I know.  We're not even looking at each other.  We're so used to talking on the phone doing the same thing. 
[00:41:00]  It doesn't matter.  You're used to this.  I tell you, if I let you listen to his voicemail message, I could actually have him  brought up on charges.  All right.  We're going to break.  Regroup here.  Colin Quinn.  A lot of good things happening.  A lot of good.  Big things.  Yeah?  Up for a writing job on Flight of the Conchords.  Jimmy said he'll speak to somebody from him.  He loves that show.  Submitting sketch ideas.  It's funny, man.  I love that show.  They both look straight ahead.  That's ironic.  They don't look at each other. 
[00:41:30]  That's crazy.  That's ironic.  Yeah, it really is.  I mean, just two guys that communicate so naturally.  Awkward's always funny.  Yeah.  This is the ONA virus spreading across America.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to your radio.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ah, one of my favorite bits of all times that we ever did.  Mm-hmm.  This was Dice Finds God.  It was Dice Finding Jesus.  Hey, don't do the bit. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I won't do it.  That was a little appetizer.  All right.  They're getting the whole meal of the bit now.  Yeah, check it out.  I'm the worst of Opie and Anthony.  You hear me?  I hear you.  Mario.  What's up, gentlemen?  How are you, Mario?  Yeah, you know what I learned today?  Yeah.  I learned that Dice is one step closer to finding God.  All right.  Could you see Dice doing that?  So I got to tell you about my new personal relationship with Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.  Yeah, I got to change the back of my jacket because I'm now a disciple of Jesus. 
[00:42:30]  You hear me?  And you'll hear the words of Christ.  Yeah.  You know, would that just be too much?  That would be something I would check out if he decided to be like a minister or something.  I'd go to church every Sunday to hear that.  Jesus walked around healing people wearing a loincloth so the lepers wouldn't have to look at his yam bag.  Okay?  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  So he's walking around. 
[00:43:00]  He sees a leper, you know, and they're like, oh, Jesus, could you cure me?  Yeah, sure.  Slap the nose back on your face.  I'll wave my hand.  You'll be okay.  Hey!  Praise the Lord.  Now, the Lord is our Savior.  I went to a period of my life where I was doing things that maybe the Lord didn't like.  You hear me? 
[00:43:30]  But Jesus is over here now.  Okay?  In my heart.  Jesus is over here now.  It just won't work, man.  And the Lord saith to you, stop your evil ways.  Over here.  Over here.  Okay?  I'm over here now.  My disciple, Clopson of Kenny, come here.  Yeah, I found Jesus Christ.  I walk with the Lord now.  Jesus Christ, he's over here now. 
[00:44:00]  He's over here.  In Dice's heart.  Dice would like the Virgin Mary, that's for sure, huh?  Hey, I'm a man of God now.  Yeah.  I can't be saying things about the Virgin Mary.  No, of course not.  You know, because she is a virgin.  Oh!  It was Immaculate Conception, Jesus.  With Mary.  Immaculate!  Oh, my God. 
[00:44:30]  Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.  Now I found the words of Jesus.  Right.  Christ is my Savior.  No more with the hairy banana.  Now it's a cross.  I do my work with a cross.  I'm touring the country, spreading the word of God.  Could you see that?  Oh, my God.  That would be too friggin' surreal. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, Jesus is over here now.  Over here now.  Oh, Father, who art in heaven.  Oh!  So, you know, in the old days, I might have talked about Moses going to the burning bush and added in something dirty.  But it's a beautiful thing.  I'm walking with Jesus.  You ever see that picture with the footprints in the sand? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, there's only one set of footprints.  And Jesus walking next to me during the times of my life.  And I say, hey, Jesus, how come during the toughest parts of my life there's only one set of footprints?  Why'd you leave me, you scum?  Why'd you leave me, you scum?  And he said, no, dice.  That's when I carried you.  Right.  So I broke down crying in tears.  Yeah.  Let me read now from the book of dice. 
[00:46:00]  You need a personal relationship with God.  We're all equal.  The colored, the midgets, the whores.  We're all children of God over here.  Can I get an amen over here?  Amen.  Hey, shut your ass.  Sorry, sorry.  Okay?  Okay.  You know, I don't want to be laying there dying over here.  Before I find Jesus.  Before you find Jesus.  Right.  Because Satan does seem like a lot of fun. 
[00:46:30]  Oh!  A dream, you know, bigger than selling out the garden would be Saint Dice.  Okay?  The patron saint of studded leather jackets.  Huh?  I'm over here now.  Where are you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Oh! 
[00:47:00]  I'll be at Saint Whack Bag Episcopal Church.  A clause from Laugh Your Yambags Off.  Get out of here, Rick.  Always over the top, Rick.  And Stoner Matt from Bayonne, New Jersey.  I learned that in the world, according to Dice, everyone with bad karma is coming back as a midget with sausage-like fingers.  But even the midgets are children of God.  See, what I was saying before was bad.  You think when midgets go to heaven, they get small little angel wings? 
[00:47:30]  No, it's not funny.  It's really what I'm thinking.  Jesus, over here now.  I was over there.  Now I'm over here with the Lord.  Just remember the battle cry of the Lord.  Jesus is over here now.  Opie and Anthony.  92. 
[00:48:00]  K-Rock.  New York.  92.  3.  K-Rock.  92.  3.  K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to your radio, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  2.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Getting ready for Butt Rub Wednesday. 
[00:48:30]  You can pick one of these people to do a butt rub with, Rich.  Oh, and shit.  Hold on a minute.  Hold on, though.  But first, it's also time for an Opie and Anthony sing-along.  Hold on.  We'll get to you in a second.  But we like to do this from time to time.  We like getting songs stuck in your head.  Oh, yeah.  And we found a really, really good one today.  Okay.  The Opie and Anthony sing-along.  Nice music. 
[00:49:00]  Love the MIDI.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Some stay dry and others feel the pain.  Chocolate rain.  A baby born will die before the sin.  Chocolate rain.  The school books say it can't be here again.  Chocolate rain.  The prisons make you wonder where it went.  Chocolate rain.  Build a tent and save the world with dry. 
[00:49:30]  Chocolate rain.  Zoom the camera out and see the light.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, has to be falling yesterday.  Chocolate rain.  Only in the past is what they say.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, my God.  Raise your neighborhood insurance rates.  Chocolate rain.  Makes us happy living in a gay chocolate rain.  Everybody, come on. 
[00:50:00]  Made me cross the street the other day.  Chocolate rain.  Made you turn your head the other way.  Chocolate rain.  Burn it off.  Quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Burn it off.  Using you to pop back down again.  Chocolate rain.  Burn it off.  Quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to pop back down again. 
[00:50:30]  Chocolate rain.  Down the window.  Radio chocolate rain.  How long does this go on?  Oh, another three minutes.  Enjoy, everybody.  Oh, come on.  Chocolate rain.  And you're sitting there going, this is really stupid.  Well, guess what?  A little later this morning or later on this afternoon, out of nowhere, you're going to  just be humming chocolate rain to yourself.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  What?  Which real heart it goes away somehow. 
[00:51:00]  Chocolate rain.  Makes the best of friends begin to fight.  Chocolate rain.  But did they know each other in the light?  Chocolate rain.  Every February washed away.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, we're going to the end.  We're going to the end with this one.  Celebrate chocolate rain.  The same crime has a higher price to pay.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:51:30]  The judging jury swear it's not the best.  Chocolate rain.  What is chocolate rain?  Does anyone know?  It's quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  What is chocolate rain?  Shut up!  Shut up!  No.  Stop.  No.  Quiet.  No.  Quiet.  No.  Stop it.  No.  The avenged chocolate rain.  Stop it.  No.  Stop whining.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:52:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Turn their body into GDP.  Chocolate rain.  The bell cow blames the baby's DNA.  Chocolate rain.  Okay.  Terrific.  But test scores are how much the parents make chocolate rain.  Okay.  Terrific.  Flipping cars in France the other night.  Chocolate rain.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Please shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:52:30]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Please.  Just shut up.  Angels try and shake their heads in shame.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Why?  What happened?  It just goes on.  Oh, yeah.  Which part do you think you're living in chocolate rain?  Oh, keep saying it's stupid, but you'll see.  Later today.  Out of nowhere.  Chocolate rain.  Now I wish you for that category.  Re-made.  We got to where we are.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:53:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's really quickly crashing through your rain.  Chocolate rain.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Using you to pop that down again.  Chocolate rain.  It's catchy, right?  No.  What?  It's the worst.  Who is it?  Why is he doing this?  Why is he doing this?  Using you to pop that down again.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:53:30]  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Chocolate rain.  Can't you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Yeah, you try not to say that later on today.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Then you're going to curse us.  Chocolate rain.  Let's say hi to Rob in Jersey.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I've found this guy on YouTube the other day.  His name's Pei Zonde. 
[00:54:00]  He's got probably 30 videos on YouTube, and one of which is just selected readings so people  can hear his reading and speaking voice.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's a disaster.  Every song is sung like that, and they make no sense.  I like chocolate rain.  Say it.  Chocolate rain.  Meow.  Meow.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  Chocolate rain.  I got the song down.  I love it. 
[00:54:30]  Don't make me start it over again, Ant.  No, don't.  Don't make me start it over again.  Don't.  Chocolate rain.  I don't think people are appreciating chocolate rain.  We didn't do it for them to appreciate it.  What is it about, by the way?  We did it to get under their skin, and then later today, they're just going to go,  Chocolate rain.  What was that about?  And then they're going to go, I curse them, I do.  I don't get what the song is about.  The over-influx.  Maybe it's a song about the bit we are thinking of doing. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, the one we wanted to do?  Yeah, that would fit.  Let's just put it this way.  It has something to do with a super soaker, and something that could be confused for chocolate  rain.  Did it be dee dee dee dee dee?  Chocolate rain.  I think he's trying to be deep and trying to make some kind of a statement.  And Jared's standing there, chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Super soaker pointed at him.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:55:30]  All over his face.  Chocolate rain.  They call me Cream Pie Jones.  Oh, well, yeah.  Yeah, you know that.  Yeah, you really proved that yesterday.  We'll get into that in about a half hour.  Trust me.  Chocolate rain.  I love this song.  I got to hear it again.  No.  Just a piece.  I need to hear the chocolate rain.  It could be Jared's new one.  Theme music.  Chocolate rain. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Some stay dry and others feel the pain.  Chocolate rain.  A baby born will die before the sin.  Chocolate rain.  Was Abby born?  What?  The school books say it can't be here again.  Chocolate rain.  Come on, just sing along.  The prisons make you wonder where it went.  The prisons make you wonder where it went?  Yeah.  Join me.  Join me.  You know you want to.  Chocolate rain.  Zoom the camera out and see the light. 
[00:56:30]  Chocolate rain.  Zoom the camera.  It has to be falling yesterday.  Chocolate rain.  Super soaker filled with chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Not gonna be pleasant for Jared.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  With my speech impediment, I couldn't think of a worse song to sing.  Chocolate rain.  I want to sing it, but I can't.  Chocolate rain.  Do you have a dryer door? 
[00:57:00]  Chocolate rain.  Who's in the front row?  Shut up, you effing whore.  Chocolate rain.  I know the struggle.  Chocolate rain.  Of chocolate rain.  Hey, this is in my system, right?  Remember when we got the banana song stuck in everyone's head?  Trust me, this will be stuck in your head.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to pop back down again.  Chocolate rain.  I don't get it.  What?  What?  I don't know what it means. 
[00:57:30]  Does everything have to have a meaning?  That does.  Chocolate rain.  If you're gonna babble on for five minutes about chocolate rain, I don't know what it means.  Chocolate rain.  All right, we got Joe in Cambridge.  He has joined me.  Chocolate rain.  I got one person that has joined me so far.  Joe in Cambridge.  Cambridge.  No one wants to.  Hold on, hold on.  Come on, join me, George.  What do you got, George?  Let's go.  Chocolate rain.  Yeah, see, it feels good.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  First of all, friends begin to fight chocolate rain. 
[00:58:00]  We're in the new each other in the night.  Chocolate rain.  You like Huey Lewis and the Knicks?  Yeah, at this point.  Chocolate rain.  Stays behind his colors.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Trust me, that'll be stuck in your head a little later on today. 
[00:58:30]  It's really quickly crashing through your chocolate rain.  Just listen to one of his lyrics here.  All right.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  It's really quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  It makes no sense.  This dummy.  Well, how about we come up with our own lyrics and then...  I think it just means...  Come up with a lyric and then we all just go, chocolate rain. 
[00:59:00]  I think it means he had an upset stomach.  Talking about heroin.  Huh?  Talking about heroin.  Using you to fall back down again.  No.  Oh, it always has to be about drugs with you.  That's what it is.  Flipping cars in France.  The other...  No.  Chocolate rain.  A lot of people say it's about heroin.  Wow.  Rich might have came up with something today.  It's about heroin.  Chocolate rain.  No.  Because it looks kind of chocolate-ly?  No, there's just brown heroin that people... 
[00:59:30]  Shake their heads in shame.  Chocolate rain.  Lift the arc of paradise and send chocolate rain.  Someone is starting.  Monster rain.  Monster rain.  Get under the porch.  Patty McGee from Jersey.  Me and little Jimmy under the porch.  Monster rain.  Oh, my God.  You're absolutely right, James, in North Carolina.  And my new ringtone.  Take my phone.  I want my phone to ring with chocolate rain. 
[01:00:00]  Using you to fall back down again.  Chocolate rain.  It's really quickly crashing through your veins.  Chocolate rain.  Using you to fall back down again.  All right, hold on.  Scott in New Jersey.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  State boy made a duty.  Chocolate rain.  Say, come on.  They're joining me, Ant.  They're joining me.  No, no one's digging this song.  They're joining me. 
[01:00:30]  Slowly but surely.  Chocolate rain.  My lower intestines are in lots of pain.  Chocolate rain.  There you go.  Say, you're in.  You're in now, Ant.  Go to traffic and see how many cars are driving off the road right now.  Guaranteed to leave a big stain.  Chocolate rain.  Guaranteed to clog your drain.  It's just getting it.  Boss is in.  Chocolate rain.  Come on.  Who else?  Step up to the mic. 
[01:01:00]  Thought I was done, but I'm going back again.  Chocolate rain.  Certain parts of me are aflame.  Chocolate rain.  Time to do laundry again.  What a pain.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  What's happening?  How many more hours am I on this plane?  Chocolate rain.  There you go. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, no.  Stuck in traffic.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  We're going to have to clean this up with a crane.  Chocolate rain.  Not enough TP in the house.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Ah, Rich from Manhattan.  We built this city on chocolate rain.  I'm about to blow a vein in my brain.  Chocolate rain. 
[01:02:00]  On your couch, you leave a stain.  You have the stain already.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come up with some more ride schemes.  Greg, a long hour.  What's up?  Exemers have to hear this again and again on the replay.  That's right.  Chocolate rain.  If the cows eat enough grain, chocolate rain.  I don't know.  Rolling forward and backwards on the train. 
[01:02:30]  Chocolate rain.  Remember that from a bit about a week ago or so.  Jake's got the instant feedback of the day.  This dumb bit is driving me insane.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, brother.  I dare you not to say chocolate rain at least once today, though.  Your friends and your co-workers are going to be like, what the hell are you humming? 
[01:03:00]  Chocolate rain.  Here's another dumb trick by David Blaine.  Chocolate rain.  Alright, very good.  So, I got to call my house.  Apparently, the weather screwed up one of my windows in the basement.  And what does that mean?  It means that water was building up in one of the window wells.  Yeah.  And the window broke.  Oh, really?  And that water poured into my basement. 
[01:03:30]  Jesus.  Chocolate rain.  In Anthony's basement.  Chocolate rain.  Chocolate rain.  Mud is flowing down the basement drain.  Chocolate rain.  Oh.  That house is driving me insane.  Chocolate rain.  Oh, wow.  Water ruined.  Anthony's windowpane.  Chocolate rain.  Hey, Marky from Philly.  This bit is really lame. 
[01:04:00]  Chocolate rain.  Some stay dry and others feel the pain.  Chocolate rain.  A baby born will die before the sin.  Chocolate rain.  Happy father sin.  This book saying it can't be here again.  Chocolate rain.  We're getting it, uh, yeah.  The prisons make you wonder where it went.  Chocolate rain.  It's getting stuck in people's heads.  I know it.  I know it.  I know it.  The world will dry.  Chocolate rain.  More with Opie and Anthony. 
[01:04:30]  Zoom the camera out and see.  After the break.  Chocolate rain.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  Thursday.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst of.  I was hoping we were going to bury this one.  But, uh.  Don't say it.  Don't say it like that.  Well, we're introing this next segment. 
[01:05:00]  It's when we first were introduced to Tom.  Yeah.  Who's basically going to die in the next six months.  Oh, and listen to the hilarity that ensues on this one.  Yeah, we got all the details.  This is when we first got the details of his horrible disease.  Yeah, now we have a segment called Is Tom Alive Friday?  Well, this is where it all began.  The steam pipe explosion is still the big story here in New York City.  Oh, stupid steam pipe.  It's spread to Boston and everywhere else because now every city is kind of looking at their steam pipes and wondering if it could happen in their city. 
[01:05:30]  And, uh.  Anthony brought up a great point yesterday.  You know, he drives in from Long Island.  Oof.  And because this happened on 41st and Lex, they had to close streets all the way to 57th Street and all the way down to, what, 30-something?  Dude, there is.  It's like 20 blocks have been closed off because of one major problem in one block.  They cordoned off a perimeter that is ridiculous.  Someone's got to explain that to us because every time there's some kind of problem in New York City, they don't just close off that little area and control it. 
[01:06:00]  They have to, like, close off, like, just miles around it.  I want to take 3rd Avenue up.  That's what I do.  I pop out of the Midtown Tunnel and I take 3rd up and it's a breeze.  And they closed 3rd.  What are you closing 3rd for?  Where is it?  It's at Lex.  It's Lexington.  It's not even the same street.  Leave me alone.  I want to drive up 3rd. 
[01:06:30]  Why are you sounding like Jerry Seinfeld all of a sudden?  Whoa!  I don't want to be a pirate!  Kevin Meany.  A little Kevin Meany?  Yeah.  I heard Kevin Meany and Seinfeld.  It was like a mixture, I think.  Yeah.  He was morphing.  It's just so goddamn annoying.  Let's say hi to Tom at White Plains.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I just want to tell you.  Uh, they cordon off such a large area because all the steam pipes are wrapped in asbestos and they want to clean up the air. 
[01:07:00]  Uh, that shout of the tow truck is really eerie.  Uh, creeps me out.  Yes, as much as your voice?  Yeah.  Well, we're there.  Are you a little person?  Sir?  Tom?  Okay.  Are you a little person?  Uh, I'm not that tall.  Yeah?  How short are you? 
[01:07:30]  I'm 5'6".  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  Because you got like that voice going on a little bit that, um, a lot of, uh...  Oh my god, this guy's creepy.  Tom, what's your deal?  Come on.  Come on, give it up.  What's your deal?  Is your last name Thumb?  Uh, my first name, yes, it is.  No.  You got me, you got me.  Oh, he fights back.  I like that you fight back, Tom. 
[01:08:00]  Scrappy.  But we're all noticing that your voice is a little different.  We're wondering why.  Are you willing to share with us?  Progeria?  Uh, I just woke up and I have a lung disease.  Oh god.  Oh, a lung disease.  What do you have?  Cystic fibrosis?  Uh, no.  Something that you probably never get.  What does that mean?  And what does that do to your poor lungs?  It's when you...  Uh, actually, it attacks any part of your body, but, uh, it's, uh, I lost about 40% of my lungs, so... 
[01:08:30]  Oh, how old a guy are you?  I'm, I'm 42.  Oh my god.  Oh my god.  What cause is that?  They don't know.  Toss let rain.  Oh.  Can't take a deep breath again.  Toss let rain.  I'll never sing deep again.  Toss let rain.  Hey, Tom has a sense of humor. 
[01:09:00]  Oh.  Wait, I do, do, can, is it hard for you to breathe?  When I hear someone's lungs, I'm like, is it hard to take a deep breath?  Yes.  Yes.  Uh, uh...  Yes.  Walking up hills is difficult, walking up stairs.  Uh, how about dales?  Down is easy because they just fall.  But, uh...  Uh, it's the episode, the hard part.  Yes, sir, normally the down is not the strength.  Yeah, yeah, this whole fighting gravity thing.  Do you, do you, uh, have like oxygen that you, you use? 
[01:09:30]  Uh, no, I've been fighting that because once you start using it, you become very dependent on it.  Yeah, but it might, it might be pretty good.  You hook one up to a little rascal and then you just give up on life?  Exactly.  How'd you know you had it, man?  How'd you know you had it?  Yeah, what happened?  Uh, I, I was diagnosed, uh, I was diagnosed in 2000.  I was noticing, uh, I worked up, uh, well, a hospital. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, boy.  And as I was walking up 96th Street, I said, boy, I'm going to be getting out of shape.  And, uh, I woke up thinking I'm having a heart attack, uh, and, uh, went to work and then...  Went to work.  Why would you wake up thinking you're having a heart attack and go to work?  Oh, well, he works at a hospital.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay, that's different.  Two birds with one stone.  Yeah, that's why I think he's going to Starbucks.  I'm clocking in and going to the ER. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Well, at first I ate eight pieces of bacon and I, uh...  Right.  Figure what the hell.  I'm in good hands, right.  Damn, there's nothing they can do about this?  Drink heavy cream.  And absolutely nothing.  Yeah.  I, I take, uh, some asthma medication just to help me breathe a little better, but that's it.  So, so are you going to, are you going to live with this or is it going to get worse?  What are, what are we talking about here?  Can't they transplant, uh, do a lung transplant on you? 
[01:11:00]  Uh, well, that's, uh, an option, uh, in a couple of years.  It also affects my heart.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'll probably just drop dead one day.  Oh, my God.  We need all the fans we can get.  Goodness gracious.  Oh, my God.  I love you.  I love you guys.  I, I, uh, I listen to you every day.  Wow.  And, uh, oh, my God.  You guys, you guys make my day. 
[01:11:30]  All right, now, just to make sure he's a, he's a big fan.  Yeah.  What's, uh, what's your favorite part of the Opie and Anthony show?  Like, what's your favorite bit?  What's your favorite thing that we do?  I can't do this.  Do it.  Anthony?  I, I, I, I can't do it.  Yeah.  I can't do it.  When you do the voices.  Do it.  Uh, especially with the little megaphone.  Do it.  I can't do this.  Uh, and, uh, and it's like, uh.  Something is happening to me.  I'm getting emotion in my body.  I can't do this.  Where's the little megaphone?  Yeah, I got, you like the voices I do with the little megaphone? 
[01:12:00]  Hey.  Yeah, exactly.  But that was my voice.  Hi, um, my name is Parrot Lungs.  Oh, poor guy.  Hey, uh, a lot of suggestions coming in.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Uh, Tom, can you repeat this?  Uh, the plane.  The plane.  The plane.  The plane.  Oh, the poor guy.  Well, no pity.  He doesn't want pity. 
[01:12:30]  And somebody wants you to do the diabolical laugh today.  Oh.  But that could just cause a hard time.  I know that.  Jeez.  We don't want that on our conscience.  Oh, I can't breathe that.  What's the most physical activity you can do, like, on the average?  Uh, I, I try to walk.  Like, uh, at least a mile every day.  At least a mile, huh?  Yeah, in, like, malls.  And because, uh.  Because you want to horrify everybody.  Because you're a pedophile?  Sometimes it's tough, like, you just fold a piece of loose leaf. 
[01:13:00]  It's never too late to learn.  Oh, someone's suggesting, uh, for him it would be a diabolical laugh.  Oh, wow.  Yes, sir.  Oh, no.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  We got you now.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Come on.  Old easy wider lungs.  You're supposed to do it three times, but we'll accept one from this guy.  Yeah.  The diabolical laugh has to be three.  Three of them.  No cure. 
[01:13:30]  No cure for this, huh?  Don't do that.  You're wearing your lungs out.  I know.  That's still one.  Uh, you got it.  Oh, look.  He's breathing heavy.  I know.  Dude, you're breathing heavy.  Three in a row.  I can't do that.  Don't.  All right.  That's what you have editing for.  What do you have?  A little, uh, like, uh, uh, one of those asthma things that you spray into your lungs? 
[01:14:00]  Uh, uh, inhaler.  An inhaler, yeah.  How much do you weigh there, Tom?  Tom, how much do you weigh?  I weigh, uh, actually, I'm a little, uh, heavier than you.  I weigh 170.  Okay.  170 at 5'6"?  Yeah, I like to do this from time to time.  If you think, uh, well, why don't you keep talking, Tom?  Because, uh, you don't have much time to live.  Yeah, just let him roll out.  Well, the weight gain was from Prednisone. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, it was?  Oh, yeah, well.  What do they do?  They, you have to have a, take it with water and a candy bar?  And shove it in a pork chop?  Yeah.  That drug will just...  Take it with water in the refrigerator.  Yeah.  Uh, that, that just distorts your face and other parts of your body.  It's a terrific drug for everybody.  Yeah, nice question.  Well...  All right, Tom, it's not about you.  We got to move on.  We have a radio show to do.  Try to stay, stay alive and give us a call at some point.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[01:15:00]  How about this?  New bit.  New bit.  New bit!  Tom, you call us every Friday and then, you know, a Friday goes by, we don't hear from  you.  Yeah, we know what happened.  Yeah.  All right?  And there'll be a relief every Friday when you call.  People will be like, oh, wow, he's still alive.  Thank God.  All right, let's do this.  You can listen to me blow my head off.  All right.  Oh, well, that's one way to solve your problem.  What do you mean by that, Tom?  He's going to stand on 43rd and Lex.  When I can no longer walk, I figured that's what I'm going to do. 
[01:15:30]  You're just going to blow your head off?  Yeah.  Nine millimeter, nine millimeter Beretta.  Yeah, you got one?  Power point.  You got it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're just waiting.  Wait, so this is really what you're going to do eventually?  Oh, yeah.  Eventually.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  How long do they give you before you reach that point where you can't really walk and  you got to blow your brains out? 
[01:16:00]  Uh, they don't.  They just say, yeah, well.  Well, they didn't give you a date.  One day you're going to wake up and maybe that's not going to happen anymore.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you buy a gun just for that, dude?  But.  Wait, Tom.  What was your show?  Sorry.  Did you buy a gun just for that?  No.  I had the gun from a job.  I used to work for an organization.  So, Tom, we're learning today when this gets really bad that you have decided that you want 
[01:16:30]  to go out that way.  Uh, well, I first thought about poisoning.  I have enough narcotics to kill a small army in my, uh, safe.  But, uh, that's too easily to be found.  Uh, this way, boom, it's over with.  Uh, yeah, you don't want to take any chances, right? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  And then finding you.  And then they try to bring you back and then even, you know, worse off.  You wake up, you're even worse off in the hospital.  You're like, oh, now I'm, uh, brain damaged.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Hey, Fat Spanky from Dublin, Ohio, he writes, uh, who's his favorite band?  Weezer.  Oh.  Dude.  He likes the police song, Every Breath You Take.  Yeah, can we play Every Breath You Take for this, this poor fella? 
[01:17:30]  Please.  Make him happy.  Hey, uh, Tom, can you do a rock scream for us?  No.  Well, Dave from Woodbridge is suggesting that Tom do a rock scream.  Kill the guy.  He's a fan of the show.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's hear your rock scream.  Uh, I don't know if I can do it.  No.  All right.  Nah, nah.  He can't do a rock scream.  Maybe I'll go on next Friday and try.  Yeah, he's got to work.  No, no, no.  He's got to inhale a week.  It's like, for a week. 
[01:18:00]  No, Tom, you don't understand.  Now, like, uh, we have a vested interest in you.  You have to call next Friday.  We have to know how you're doing.  All right?  Okay.  And if, if you don't call in next Friday, we're just going to assume, you know.  It's the worst.  Yeah.  Yeah, you better call in or we'll be depressed.  All right?  Here's your song.  Okay.  And we got a song for you and everything.  Your song is for Tom.  A new friend.  Tom from White Plains.  Tom, any, uh, any...  What's up, guys? 
[01:18:30]  Huh?  Checking out.  All right.  Well, not literally, right?  Just punching out for today.  Right, Tom?  Yeah.  All right.  Hang in there, Tom.  Your take.  There it is.  Good luck to you, sir.  There he goes.  Tom from White Plains.  That is depressing.  No kidding, man.  He's not amazing.  He's serious.  Yeah, I know he's serious.  And, you know, what are we supposed to do?  I don't know.  Tell him to keep living?  Sounds like it's, uh, hell on, uh, hell on earth.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, what happened?  All right.  Tom will call us next Friday.  We'll see how he's doing.  That, uh, took a little bit of a turn, huh?  Ah, it's interesting.  Everyone's got their cross to bear.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Give a hollow point bullet gun.  By the way.  Like, ah, there's the final option.  There it is.  At least he's got his plan.  All right.  We got a break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Ah!  Talking about the, uh, Flight 990 stuff. 
[01:19:30]  Oof.  Now they're saying that it's a possibility that one of the pilots decided to commit suicide  and...  I kill you!  And bring...  I kill you!  And bring 216 people with him.  I am tarbosh!  My tooth!  My teeth!  They're killing me!  I'm a crash plane!  Ah!  Why?  Why are you doing this to me?  Ah!  That's just a scary thought. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, you gotta worry about every other thing that happens.  The weather, uh, mechanical failure.  Some F up.  And then you...  You got a co-pilot that wants to cash it in?  Well, that's what they're thinking at this point.  They can't confirm anything, but...  Yeah.  That's where they're leading lately.  Putting the information together, that's what they're, uh, the conclusion they're drawing.  They want to hand over the case to the FBI, so that's not good news.  It's like, what are you gonna do, though?  Arrest the guy?  I mean, jeez, it's done. 
[01:20:30]  Nothing he can do at this point.  Whoops.  That's just a scary thought.  I am tarbosh!  I am pissed off!  I am the Egyptian!  Ah!  First, he said some kind of a prayer about death that they picked up on the tape, and  then just, woo, put the plane into a nosedive.  Well, first of all, why did the other pilot leave?  They leave every so often.  You've seen it.  Haven't you seen that?  You've been sitting in your seat?  I've never seen a pilot walk back.  How you doing, Dad?  Never seen a pilot leave that cockpit. 
[01:21:00]  He's still got the voice.  Even in the aisle, like he's walking back, you're like, hey, look, it's the pilot.  Yeah, how you doing?  Ladies and gentlemen, I'll just be walking to the back.  Got to take a leak, and there's no bathroom up here on the flight deck, which used to  be called a cockpit, but that's a pretty funny word.  Well, you don't look to the rear of the aircraft.  I'll be taking a leak, and the co-pilot's up there with his plurazine.  Lithium should be okay.  You're in capable hands. 
[01:21:30]  But this guy, it seems, was suicidal and put the plane into a nosedive, and the pilot  gets back just in time to see him shutting off the engine.  Oh, I've been walking, but I'm bully, bully, oh, my goodness, what are you doing?  And then he, yeah, he shipped there, Greg.  And then he tries to recover, pulls back on the stick, but I guess it was too late.  And then someone shut the engines off.  That's a good thing to do, I guess.  Who knows? 
[01:22:00]  They say this plane approached the speed of sound before it busted up and crashed.  And now they're saying it could be because the co-pilot was suicidal.  If you're suicidal, please, find a rock, go behind it, and blow your brains out or something.  Yeah, don't take out other people, you selfish bastards.  That is selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish.  Crawl into a hole, do it yourself.  This guy now, if this is true, and he commits suicide and takes along 216 people with him,  he's the biggest mass murderer ever. 
[01:22:30]  That's just as bad as going into a place, opening fire, and then shooting yourself in the head.  What's the difference?  Could you imagine some guy walking into an office building and mowing down 216 people and then shooting himself in the head?  That would be the hugest of huge stories.  But it's just a pilot committing suicide or something.  Right.  So it doesn't seem that weird, but it's just as bad.  I mean, just as bad.  This guy took 216 people with him. 
[01:23:00]  Yeesh.  So they're handing it over to the FBI.  Yeah.  We're going to find out more soon.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to just put the plane into a nosedive.  Enjoy the scenery.  If you look out the port side window, you'll see the wing rip off as we approach the speed of sound.  It should be pretty exciting for the kids.  If they want to look out the other side, the engine just ripped right off.  It's flaming.  That's it.  If you can't see up front, your window's probably blocked by the fuselage skin that's peeling back like a banana peel. 
[01:23:30]  Very exciting sight to see.  Oh, look at the water.  It's coming up pretty quickly.  Get your prayers out of the way.  Anything else?  Maybe you want to jot down a quick note because we're all going to die.  Thank you for flying Egypt Air.  Those guys are always under control.  Doesn't matter what.  Doesn't matter what.  I was laughing.  I was watching some dopey movie.  That movie about the sharks and stuff that came out.  Deep Blue Sea.  Deep Blue Sea.  Sure.  And it was the stereotypical chopper pilot. 
[01:24:00]  Chopper pilots.  I mean, they're even better than the regular pilots, than airline pilots, because they are constantly just cool.  Right.  There is a hurricane that they have to evac people off of this offshore laboratory.  The wind is like 200 miles an hour.  Rain.  They can't see anything.  The pilot's just like, EPA, five minutes, sir.  And his face is just stomping.  They never like, he looks over his co-pilot at one minute and goes, holy, I can't believe the weather. 
[01:24:30]  Because we're probably going to die.  Just a little bit.  Why don't you get those wipers on high?  Look, old flaming hail.  Well, I've never seen this before, but I'm sure we could cut right through this.  No problem.  Your stewardess is going to come around with your last meal.  As we plummet towards the water, try not to puke on your pals.  You're a good thing.  Your family's probably not going to get much more than a finger or anything, so you don't have to worry about anyone identifying you.  That bang you're going to hear is the sound barrier. 
[01:25:00]  We've just crossed it.  A stewardess just flew out the back of the plane.  Took a hole in the back of the plane.  Very exciting for the kids.  Just feel free to crap yourself.  Of course, the no crapping light has been turned off.  You're free to crap around the cabin.  Tammy, what's going on?  I'm a flight attendant.  You know what the guys do?  What do they do in there?  Okay, the minute that, right after you take off, it goes into autopilot. 
[01:25:30]  And then after it goes to autopilot, they read books.  They read books?  It's all automated now, man.  They read books in every bump.  I'm like, what was that?  You know, you watch the movies and stuff and you see, you see like the pilot, you know, okay.  This is the tower.  You're clear to us in to 30,000 feet.  And then he's like, okay.  And you see them like pull back on the stick.  That doesn't happen.  They have a dial with the altitude.  They dial it in, push a button, the plane does the rest.  It goes up. 
[01:26:00]  It goes up to 30,000.  And they're just reading books, playing cards.  I read a whole thing on this typical flight from New York to L.A.  And the pilot and co-pilot are playing cards.  Cards.  Cards.  No fish.  Ladies and gentlemen, I've just, I've got four jacks up here to watch the turbulence.  Yeah, they're always very calm.  I'm very attentive to what the pilot's saying, too.  And I hate that because a lot of times the air, like somebody sitting next to you puts the air on so loud that I can't hear it. 
[01:26:30]  So you hear like the bing, bing.  Ladies and gentlemen.  I'm like, what are you saying?  What, pilot?  I can't hear you.  Turn the fan off, damn it.  He's talking to me.  And I'm only catching like little words that are really alarming me.  I'm like, what, what? 
[01:27:00]  What did he say?  I can't hear the pilot.  Matt, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Oh, and hey, listen.  A year ago, I was coming back from Jamaica on an air Jamaica flight.  That's got to be good.  And they blew an engine.  And they had this Jamaican guy.  I think he was smoking a spliff in the cockpit.  And they're telling you how to prepare for a crash landing. 
[01:27:30]  Are you serious?  People, I'm being, husbands are holding hands with their kids, like praying and crying.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Freaking out the people.  And they put the bar away.  I was like, where's the bar?  That's the time to bring it out.  I'm telling you.  He's not.  He's crazy to make you.  Come on, we're going to die.  But we all die together.  We all die, die, die together in a flaming crash.  We're going to die together. 
[01:28:00]  Love your kids, everybody.  Smoke a spliff.  Every, these two of us will now hand out the big spliffs.  Walk up, you won't even care.  You're going to be ripped to shreds.  Flames full of fuel.  You'll barely feel it when we hit the ground.  Look like a, look like a big joint blowing up.  Like a seed exploding in a big stock joint.  Man, and they tell you, they tell you, you know, take your shoes off, take your...  Is that why they always find shoes floating in the water? 
[01:28:30]  I always wonder that.  Like, God, they blew the shoes off.  No, they tell you to take them off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  We're dying.  Neither can be for my soul.  That's it.  Look at the ring.  It's covered with bamboo.  Bill.  Uh, Bill.  Hey, how you doing, ONA? 
[01:29:00]  All right.  I got a theory on why that plane crashed.  Okay.  I'm thinking that the pilot had too much slurpy, got a major brain freeze, and just couldn't  handle it.  God damn.  I am tarbosh.  I am pissed off.  I am the Egyptian.  The plane went down.  Oh, my God.  I can't drink it no more.  That's it, man.  That's it.  Ah!  Why?  Ah! 
[01:29:30]  Slightly, you're out there.  This is your pilot car bus.  I am going to be cruising at altitude to 33,000 feet.  As I told you that my life sucks.  My wife, my wife will leave me.  Three cameras die.  And I stopped my tow walking into cockpit.  It's very distraught today. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, pilot, why don't you go check the back of the plane?  I will stay here and watch.  I will stay here.  No, no.  I haven't even been thinking of turning off autopilot and engines and sending the plane into death  dive at supersonic speeds.  I wouldn't even dream of that.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your window, you will see our 767 engines ripping from the wings.  Don't be alarmed. 
[01:30:30]  Just take your shoes off.  Don't be alarmed.  Because that's what you do.  Because that's what you do.  Look.  Oh, as we see the skin of the plane peel back like banana.  Pray to Allah.  Here we go into the water.  Don't worry.  You won't feel a thing.  You won't feel a thing.  Oh, my two-thirds.  I am Tarmaz, the Egyptian magician, flying plane.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Why?  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:31:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:31:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  And we got Bill Burr in studio.  Hello.  And he's very excited because Bret Michaels is coming in in about 20, 25 minutes. 
[01:32:00]  And you're a big fan of Rock and Love.  Oh, great show.  Are you a fan because you think it's a great show or because it's kind of like a train wreck?  I'm a fan because of how they started off the show.  So out of all the humiliating things I've seen on reality television, they basically get, you know, it's basically Flavor of Love.  So they get 25.  Flavor of Love for white guys.  Right.  For the white audience.  They get 25 white whores this time, right?  They have them out in the driveway.  And, you know, Bret comes up in his yellow motorcycle. 
[01:32:30]  They're all going crazy.  I got it, Bret.  Right there, I think the show is ridiculous.  That they're going crazy over Bret Michaels.  I mean, back in the day, I understand he was with Pam and everybody else, but come on.  Jesus.  No, but.  I mean, come on.  If you saw these girls.  That's not reality.  If you saw these girls, though, they all look like the hottest girl at, like, Denny's.  I mean, retired stripper looking girls.  They're horrific, right?  So he pulls up.  Everybody goes crazy. 
[01:33:00]  And then he walks in the house and his big bouncer guy stands there and he's looking at them, welcoming them all.  And all of a sudden, he just starts calling off names.  Called off, like, he picks one girl, then picks another girl.  By the time he gets to the third girl, I'm saying to my girlfriend, going, they're going to kick these girls out.  Before they even get in the house.  Exactly.  They pick five of them.  And all the other whores are going, like, why are they not picking me, right?  They get done picking five of these girls and they're hideous.  They look like, oh, like, they're just awful looking. 
[01:33:30]  And they tell the other girls to go in the house and then they tell those five girls, basically, you're too ugly to even get into the house on a horrific reality show.  That's true.  That was awesome.  Did they talk to him?  I'm very disappointed.  Well, there was one girl who just, like, all of them, yeah, they're all just like, I'm embarrassed.  I came all the way from Iowa, like, from horrific states, right? 
[01:34:00]  The bus from Oklahoma City was 72 hours just to get to Utah.  I deserved more, right?  But one girl just refused to leave.  She was just the whore that wouldn't quit, right?  So she comes back, you know, and just starts pounding on the door.  And then they just had to let her in.  And, I mean, she looked like she was every bit of 47.  Oh, my God.  Was that Tiffany?  That was the girl who kept going, don't fret me with a good time. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, Tiffany.  We got that clip, actually.  Don't fret me with a good time.  That was her catchphrase.  They did a montage last night.  I don't know if it was on last night.  I have it on DVR or whatever.  But the episode I saw, they did a montage of her saying that over and over again.  And when she says it is basically when someone's telling her to get her life together, someone's criticizing her.  Someone's trying to give her some real good advice, and that's what she's saying.  Yeah, if you don't shape up, we're kicking you out of the house.  Don't fret me with a good time.  If you don't get off drugs, we're taking away your children. 
[01:35:00]  Don't fret me with a good time.  She was a mess.  It was great.  It's the catchphrase of the summer, though.  Oh, it's fantastic.  We got the clip of Tiffany trying to get back in the house after she was deemed too ugly to be in the house, right?  Basically.  Big Johnny called out five names.  He told us, you're out of here.  By the way, Bill, thanks for the huge setup.  No problem.  Wow, really?  We just happened to have this clip.  I have names.  He told us, you're out of here.  I didn't come all the way from Chicago to be eliminated before I even walked in the door. 
[01:35:30]  My name is Tiffany.  Hi, Tiffany.  You caught me, and I was wondering why.  Listen, it's nothing personal.  This is physical.  If it was up to Brett, he wouldn't have dismissed me.  No, Brett, if it was up to Brett, the entire city of L.A. would be here.  But I'm a big fan of this.  I had a hat made.  I came here all the way from Chicago.  There's literally nowhere for you to sleep.  I'll sleep on the floor.  Please.  Please, I'm begging you.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I don't care.  I got a hat made. 
[01:36:00]  I'll do anything.  Anything.  Let me do that, baby.  He finally said yeah, and I jumped up, hugged him, and I didn't let go.  It's meant to be.  Oh, man.  What did she have made?  A hat?  Yeah.  I can't hear.  A hat made.  Tara Reid's older sister.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  I'll do anything.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  I'll sleep in the kitchen.  I'll sleep in the bathroom.  You have to stop smoking crystal meth first. 
[01:36:30]  Tell us to me with a good time.  Don't threaten me with a good time.  I'll tell you, man.  If she did four more episodes, she could have sold a million of those t-shirts.  It was just, it really was going to, like you said, it was going to be the catchphrase  of the summer.  Oh, my God.  Well, then she gets let back in the house, and this is what she does immediately.  I'm tipping him, alcoholic.  Yeah.  Tiffany, she got completely bombed.  I was just sitting back watching, like, holy ****. 
[01:37:00]  Ain't nobody like Southside Booty.  Ain't there's no bad enough to step front of my face.  I got here this long.  I'm not going to, like, go home now.  Brett will kick me around.  Just an old, drunk broad.  Is that what she is?  This is what it's not doing justice.  She's like one of those girls who's old, but she's kept herself in shape.  Right.  So from the neck down, she could be 32, but you look at her face.  She's just a lizard.  She's closer to 50. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, it's awful.  Oh, jeez.  Tammy Faye.  Yesterday, you know what?  It's a good show.  I mean, yesterday I was watching.  They had to do phone sex.  Because if Brent Michaels is on the road, did you see that episode yet?  Oh, it was great.  I'm telling you, it's a great show.  You know, Brett's girl's got to, like, you know, help him out if he's on the road and  she's back home.  So they had all these girls, like, dress in their hottest, like, lingerie and lay on  this, like, you know, this, like, heart-shaped type bed and do phone sex and he's in another  room. 
[01:38:00]  And they hooked up something.  Did they hook it up to his?  Yeah, they actually hooked something up to his unit.  Yeah.  To see if he would get aroused.  Yeah.  And if he were terrible at it, they would just flatline.  And the best part was Brett would get halfway through if they stunk.  He just hung up on them.  Dude, I'm telling you.  They got some great bits on this show.  Oh, that's great.  One girl just started just giving phone sex and everyone else was, like, horrified.  Like, whoa, man, this is just a fun little show we're trying to participate in. 
[01:38:30]  And she's, like, I'll suck your beep.  Her whole segment was beeped out.  Wow.  That was the weird thing.  I'll take your beep in my beep until you beep.  All the other girls are watching.  So it kind of made it awkward.  But there were some girls that were just so bad at it.  They were just, like, I just really want to spend time with you.  Yeah, yeah.  I just, you know, I just think you're interesting.  And it's just like, lady, what is this supposed to do for this guy?  This guy's a rock star.  He's probably had an 18 on one. 
[01:39:00]  18 on one.  You know what I mean?  Oh, my God, Brett.  Let me tell you what I'll do.  I will take your entire beep into my beep and then beep and beep until you beep all over my beep.  And if you want to put it beep, feel free.  I don't mind that.  I've done it before.  Brett, if me staying in the house takes you putting it beep, I will do that.  I've never done that sober. 
[01:39:30]  But I'll probably do it for you.  And I'll even wash beep because my beep is probably really filthy.  But for you, I'll do anything.  I'll let you go from beep to my beep.  And that's really sick.  That's disgusting.  A lot of girls won't do that.  A lot of girls wouldn't let you put beep.  We need a fart monitor.  And then put beep.  But I would let you do that.  And you're right there. 
[01:40:00]  And I will beep until you beep.  And then if you want to put it beep, I'll even do that.  I don't care.  Do you have a dog?  If you have a dog and some peanut butter, I will beep.  The peanut butter on beep.  And then I'll let the dog beep.  And you can watch.  I'll even let the dog beep me.  All over my, on my.  And the dog could, I don't even care.  Even the dog could, uh, could beep my beep. 
[01:40:30]  Because I don't care.  And that's really dirty.  But for you, I'll do it.  We got one more Tiffany clip worth playing.  You love me, f**k.  Love me, f**k.  She's a sloppy mess.  And, uh, it's pretty funny.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  That's not a nice word.  Oh, yeah, it is.  It's not a nice word.  You can't go throwing words like that around. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, now, now.  Simmer down, now.  Simmer down, now.  No, you simmer down.  I had this one faded.  No, no, no, no, no.  You totally missed them.  We're just having a good time.  Yeah, that needed a set up, obviously.  Tiffany calls one of the two black girls in the house an effing C-word.  Oh, yeah, she was dropping it.  Dropping it like it was not that.  Why would they boot her?  Right.  Did they boot her yet?  Oh, yeah, yeah, they boot.  Yeah, she was a good girl.  That's where they're just so stupid.  Why?  You would like that the black...  You keep her as long as you possibly can. 
[01:41:30]  You know, they did it with Sanjaya.  Loose cannon.  You keep these people.  It makes it interesting.  It would have been good.  Because the black girl on the show is hilarious.  There's a clip on CW11.  Oh, there it is.  Of a clip of the show.  Yeah, well, I think he's on CW11 right now.  And then he's heading over here.  Yeah, there he is.  It's still 1988, dude.  I was going to say, don't talk about him.  But he's on there, so he can't be here.  He looks good, though, man. 
[01:42:00]  I got to say, he doesn't look much different than he did a few years ago.  Wow.  I mean, they showed him in pajamas without all that stuff.  Like, the headband.  Oh, that was bad.  Oh, my God.  That was bad.  He looked like a circus clown out of his makeup.  Oh.  It was bad, dude.  He's had some stuff done on his face.  Wow, there's chicks, like, pushing each other and stuff.  No, that black girl's hilarious.  The other black girl there is, like, she's really into animals, like PETA.  And the black girl had a fur coat.  And she goes, I hate animals.  She goes, they're for food and clothing.  And she goes, how can you say that? 
[01:42:30]  She goes, if there was an animal in here right now, I'd slit its throat.  I swear to God, just to piss her off.  And she totally took the bait.  It was great.  On last night's episode, two girls went at it after the phone sex thing.  And they're upstairs.  And one girl has, like, I think the girl calls them circus boobs.  Yeah.  She's got implants that are so massive.  And they're really high up, like, way higher than they're supposed to be.  And they just are massive.  And she calls them circus boobs.  They are a little freakish look.  She looks like she has an ass on her chest. 
[01:43:00]  So the one girl thought she was going to be cocky and started making fun of her circus boobs.  So the circus boob girl goes, oh, yeah, and just starts making fun of her face.  And it turns out that the girl that has the kind of the face is a little off is because she was in a car accident.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  So, you know, she started the like the little fight.  And then circus boob goes, well, look at your awful face.  And she's like, but that was from a car accident.  Like you went too far with this. 
[01:43:30]  And she started complaining to Brett saying it was it's it's like a disability.  Would you make fun of somebody in a wheelchair?  Right.  But she was the one.  You know how it goes.  If you're going to fight, you're going to, you know, you're going to break out all the all the weapons.  That's not fair.  I was in a car wreck.  Yeah.  If your face went through a windshield, you probably couldn't start snapping on somebody.  Yeah, you shouldn't be talking about someone's circus boobs.  They just showed a motorcycle accident, a little motocross, a little crash. 
[01:44:00]  One of those girls took face planted.  It was pretty good.  So they just put these whores in interesting little contests and competitions.  Dude, they're all whores.  They're all trying to act like they're not whores.  But they have a stripper pole in there.  And then the second they got drunk, all of them were doing those those you need whore abs stripper moves on the pole.  You know, you got your legs straight out.  It's like the only people who can do that are strippers.  Yeah.  I didn't want to like the show, but I like it.  Yeah.  VH1 knows what they're doing with this celebrity reality crap. 
[01:44:30]  I was telling the gym last night at the cellar, like we were talking about, you know, how, you know, the reality TV and game shows.  There has never been a better time in Hollywood to be a has-been than it is right now.  Oh, my God.  You're right.  You have a better shot at getting a TV show than I think.  Than anyone else.  Wow.  Somebody brand new.  Yeah.  Scott Baio.  I just want to punch him in the face.  Have you seen that show?  The Two Corys.  The Two Corys.  They were in here yesterday.  The Two Corys, yeah.  But my thing is, what is the cutoff line where even like you're too old? 
[01:45:00]  I think it's like 75 or four.  I would say like Tony Dow isn't getting a reality show.  He was the older brother on Leave It to Beaver.  But then when you get to that old, then you have to herd the has-beens.  You got to put them all in a house.  In a surreal house, yeah.  After 1970.  Like the My Three Sons guys.  The My Three Sons sons.  You can get one of them.  Yeah.  And he just sat there crying how there was no residuals.  Anyone from Gilligan's Island, do you think? 
[01:45:30]  It'd have to be one of the women.  Yeah, Marianne or Ginger.  Ginger, yeah.  Yeah, they could probably do it.  Yeah.  Hey, we got to like change gears a little bit here.  How to dial a rotary phone.  We teased this before the break.  Ah, speaking of the olden days.  I said, like, well, you know.  Speaking of Juan Epstein.  Sometimes you guys just jam on the brakes.  Well, they could do that.  The Welcome Back Cotter people would definitely be.  Yeah.  Because they had Horshack in the fights. 
[01:46:00]  Remember that?  Okay.  And they had celebrity boxing.  They've just been through all these, and they gather up the has-beens to beat each other up.  And Horshack got beat up by Screech, right?  Yeah.  Screech Screech.  I'd love to be a has-beens agent just to hear the offers that come in.  Oh, it's got to be just hysterical.  VH1 wants you for a celebrity toe jam.  Race to the bottom of the Grand Canyon with the cast from Family Affair.  Just these horrific shows. 
[01:46:30]  It's heading that way.  They're going to get worse and worse.  It is VH1.  I think they started all that stuff, too.  They're the ones we first came up with.  Yeah, yeah.  They're brilliant, man.  Well, they came up with the concept of celebrity.  Yeah, they took the reality show.  The celebrities involved with the reality show.  And making it cool, because when reality shows first hit, no celebrity would be caught dead doing it.  It's like, oh, that's hack stuff.  Those are people that just can't make it legitimately.  Yeah.  But then somehow VH1 talked them into it.  Well, they don't get the big celebrities.  They get the has-beens, which is hysterical, watching these people living together. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, but see where it's going, though?  It's going to be legitimate stars are going to sign off for this as their next project.  You watch, Hank.  That mini-me guy, he was the quickest has-been ever.  He was just like the, you know.  Yeah.  They're still in post-production.  Yeah.  And he was naked on that little scooter, peeing in the corner.  One of the greatest moments ever, by the way. 
[01:47:30]  And he was huge, like when the movies came out, the Austin Powers movies.  Like, people were quoting things from the movie.  I remember, like, page six, he was in scores, and he had little leather pants.  Yeah.  And he was the toast of the town from Monday to Wednesday.  And then he's, eh.  Here he is.  Oh, my God.  How do you make a comeback from that? 
[01:48:00]  How can you classify that as a person?  No.  What about when he started getting going?  Do we have that clip?  Do we have all the clips?  Yeah.  Did he lay in there dreaming about a fire?  Did he get a fire engine going?  What a mess.  And he was.  He was, you know.  He is.  Big star.  Even when he's sleeping, he doesn't even look peaceful. 
[01:48:30]  Completely naked on a scooter, gets off, and just takes a leak in a closet.  And then he was in all the Austin Powers movies.  That's great.  So, how to dial a rotary phone?  Ah, right.  Well, everyone around here has got their iPhones.  Some people love them.  Some people hate them.  I am a fan of the iPhone.  The jury's still out.  Jimmy?  Not a fan.  I don't hate it.  What I hate is AT&T.  I love the technology of the iPhone.  I just don't like AT&T.  American Telephone and Telegraph.  Is that what it's called?  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  It's Ma Bell.  Oh, cool.  You don't like it?  I haven't had any trouble.  Thank goodness.  iPhone sales were disappointing, by the way.  The stock dropped, what, $8 yesterday?  What it is?  I'm so happy.  It's all AT&T.  And I heard they almost had to deal with Verizon.  And because Apple is notoriously, I mean, they put out great stuff, but they're hard to deal with.  I mean, and they wanted a piece of every phone call made.  At first, they only wanted stuff sold at Apple.  And AT&T's like, well, you got to get right.  We have to all sell the phones in our stores. 
[01:49:30]  And then they want, like, 50 cents or whatever for the first minute for every phone call made on the iPhone.  Some kind of weird concession they want.  Phone companies never give up.  And Verizon, I think, from what I heard, that was the breaking point.  Verizon, like, no.  No.  And they had the best coverage by far of Verizon.  Because they had landlines.  Dude, I talked to Bob Kelly.  His phone, it cuts out all the time.  He's the worst.  He's got a $500 phone.  And I got to go, Bob, go walk back to where you were.  And I got one of those little chick phones that you flip open.  Yeah.  Verizon.  It's way better.  I haven't had any trouble.  I'm knocking wood, but I haven't had trouble with Signal. 
[01:50:00]  I love it.  I love the, look how futuristic.  I had nine or ten texts in a row.  No.  You'll throw it.  I know you're comedians.  Dude, I had nine or ten texts in a row yesterday that said, error, sending message.  Errors, cannot send.  It would not send the text.  I had to move around the house and hold my phone towards the window.  Did you sit out all night with, like, a tent to get it?  Dude, it's like holding a ray gun.  I got to point it a certain way. 
[01:50:30]  See?  That's cool.  It's futuristic.  This is a $600 phone, which I do like.  The technology about you, like, you scroll your fingers, you open it up.  It's brilliant.  Yeah.  But the fact that Steve Jobs makes things so difficult and they had to go with AT&T, it's  like, come on, guys.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  I don't like that exclusive phone company crap with telephones.  Yes.  You know, they make these deals.  You should be able to pick whatever service you want with whatever phone you want.  Whatever phone or whatever service.  Yeah, because sometimes there's a really good phone and lousy service.  Right.  Bastards.  Well, we've come a long way, though.  We certainly have. 
[01:51:00]  Here's the SEG.  So, you got the iPhone.  Mm-hmm.  A mere 50 years ago, they had to teach people how to use a rotary phone.  Rotary phone.  Because, you know, back in the day, you picked up the phone, you talked to the operator.  Right.  And then they did away with that, and now you can dial your own numbers.  You have to crank that little crank on the side.  Operator.  And go, Sarah?  Yeah.  Sarah, could you connect me to 555?  Right.  Well, here's the, here's...  Murray Hill 6.  Yeah.  Wisconsin 9 or 8.  Here they instruct you on how to use your rotary phone. 
[01:51:30]  The local news of the week.  At midnight Saturday, the telephones in this city will be changed to dial service, and all  telephone numbers will be changed.  Ah.  Late this week, new directories will be delivered.  This is important.  Here are a few important suggestions for the use of your dial telephone.  Before calling any number, first secure the number from your new directory.  Then remove the receiver and listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Doesn't everything just sound harrowing? 
[01:52:00]  Like the Russians are going to attack at any moment?  Oh, my goodness.  And why can't we, like, update that?  Why are we still using the...  We still got it.  It's a little different variation, but it's there.  But can't it be something else by this point?  I didn't understand even what he was saying.  Secure the number?  Secure the number.  Does that mean look it up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  First, secure the number.  Memorize it, or stay away from the apparatus.  You do not have the brain intellect to use this new technology.  Well, it's got the voice now.  That's it. 
[01:52:30]  It sounds like this.  If you hear it, run.  Your phone's about to explode.  The Reds have gotten your phone.  The Reds.  The Reds are coming.  The Reds.  Do not discuss the war when you pick up this apparatus.  Loose lips, sink ships.  Oh, sorry, man.  Loose lips, sink ships was my line.  Damn you, Bill Burr.  If I'd have secured the number earlier, it would have been my line. 
[01:53:00]  Listen for the dial tone.  It sounds like this.  That tone indicates everything is ready for your call.  With the receiver off the hook, dial the desired number.  For example, suppose you want to dial 2-3-6-5-0.  Dial each numeral in this manner, pulling the dial around.  That's a whole phone number.  That's a whole number?  No dash, no parentheses, no nothing.  If you want to dial 5, it's like, what's your number? 
[01:53:30]  5.  For example, suppose you want to dial 2-3-6-5-0.  Dial each numeral in this manner, pulling the dial around to the finger stop each time.  Be sure to allow the dial to freely return to its normal position.  Oh, would you try to stop it with your finger?  You push it sometimes.  Oh, I remember dial phone.  Come on.  You'd go like, and then rake it back to its starting position.  Oh, that's right, you would.  Because you'd try to dial faster? 
[01:54:00]  Why?  I forgot all about the...  Stupid dial phones.  ...the dial to freely return to its normal position.  And this is the ringing signal.  That's the same, too.  Hello?  What's the problem?  Watson, come quick.  I need you.  Alexander Graham Bell joke?  No?  No, that's good.  I just did it.  Yeah.  If the line is... 
[01:54:30]  Hello?  Do you have ten-pound balls?  Well, how do you walk?  You could call your local bowling alley.  Call a tobacco shop.  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Well, you best let him out.  He may suffocate.  There can't be much air in there.  In there?  Hello?  Is your refrigerator running?  Well, you better catch it.  Your food will go bad. 
[01:55:00]  Listen to me.  You gotta go turkey.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get Brett Weir, I said.  It's the super across the way.  Hold on, hold on.  It's gonna pick up.  If the line is busy, you'll hear this busy signal.  It's just everything is so terminal back then.  Yeah, it really is, like, meh. 
[01:55:30]  But we haven't really updated that crap.  The busy signal.  If you hear this busy signal, go to your local shelter.  Where there will be food and supplies.  You may have to stay there for weeks as the radiation settles down.  Oh, wait, it's just a busy signal.  Sorry, I thought the commies were coming.  The Reds.  The Reds.  Just when we got done with the Nazi menace, the Reds come.  And remember, if you see black people in your neighborhood, dial 9-1-1. 
[01:56:00]  No, it's back in the day.  Dial 9-1.  If you see a Negro.  No?  Dial 9-1.  9-1.  Just 9.  Yeah.  That's reserved for the police.  They'll be sure to be there with fire hoses and German shepherds.  It's the 50s, get it?  If you get a busy signal, try writing a letter.  Yeah.  I thought it was funny then. 
[01:56:30]  Good time to credit Thin.  Yeah, right?  It was funny.  Until Saturday midnight, please use your present directory and make your calls in the usual manner.  How was that?  Yelling out the window?  We just pick up and Operator did it all.  Operator.  Hey, uh...  Number, please.  More with us.  Opie and Anthony, next.  Opie and Anthony.  92.  Rock. 
[01:57:00]  K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  We got a guy on the phone.  Steve from Orange County.  Uh, Steve.  Yo.  You want to wake up your spouse?  Yeah.  All right, give us some details here.  Is it your wife, girlfriend, boyfriend?  What do you got?  My wife.  All right, your wife.  And how are you going to wake her up?  I got a blowtorch.  Jimmy said it's wake up your wife with a blowtorch. 
[01:57:30]  Wake her up with a blowtorch.  Wait, did you suggest that, Jimmy, yesterday?  I was saying that should be the name of the bit, yes.  Wake up your spouse.  But I was just being a goose.  Well, what are you going to do with the blowtorch, sir?  All I'm going to do is walk in and light it up.  You know, it's pretty loud when it lights up.  It'll get things going, you know what I mean?  Get a nice pop.  All right, promise us that you're not going to, like, burn your wife or burn down your house.  We'll try to keep away from the curtains and the hair, you know.  All right.  Here's Steve in Orange County.  He wants to wake up his wife with a blowtorch. 
[01:58:00]  Wake up, honey.  Wake up.  Why are you doing that?  It's wake up your spouse, sir, Wednesday with a blowtorch.  He just did it.  Yes.  Wait, wait.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[01:58:30]  He really did.  I heard this.  Hey, Steve, that's all right, man.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  Thank you.  Just a quickie to kick off wake up your spouse Wednesday.  With a blowtorch.  He did it with a blowtorch.  He took you seriously, Jimmy.  What an awful thing to wake up to.  She's like, what are you doing?  Steve, what are you doing?  I bet you that's what a lot of people say when their spouse ends up murdering them.  Yeah.  Because you don't expect it.  Also, you're like, what are you doing with that axe? 
[01:59:00]  That's the last thing you say.  Hey, you know what?  Doing that hammer, Carl?  Yeah, exactly.  I think there's a lot of surprise, the last thing you say, before your spouse kills you.  Yeah.  Hey.  Hey, what are you doing?  That's what she said right there.  That could have been like, that could have ended with murder.  Her whole body up in flames.  But there you go.  Now I'm thinking that the bit has finally officially taken off.  Because now I know our listeners, they're going to try to figure out a better way to wake up their spouse. 
[01:59:30]  How do you beat blowtorch?  The audio could have been better, but you got the groggy audio of the wife going, Steve, what are you doing?  Swanson.  Hey, I want to know if I can substitute wake up your spouse for wake up your brother.  Yeah, it's basically wake up someone you live with.  Just wake up anyone in the house.  But we had to come up with some kind of name for this dumb thing.  So, yeah, sure.  How are you going to wake him up, Swanson?  Actually, I'm just going to walk in screaming. 
[02:00:00]  Okay.  Hold on.  How's the hell with you?  That is fantastic. 
[02:00:30]  Who was it that you woke up?  Yeah, Swanson.  How old is your brother?  Twelve.  Twelve?  Twelve.  Oh, that's why he was like, eh.  Because he reverted back to being about four or five, and then he sounded like an almost teenager.  But he started like, eh, mommy.  Yeah, I think my mom's going to use this as a reason for me that I'm being influenced by you guys now. 
[02:01:00]  Wow, that's all right.  There you go.  We got two already.  Wow.  We've been doing this bit for about a month.  We get one here and there, and already we got two.  Okay.  Got to go, guys.  All right.  You're a good boy.  Sometimes it takes a while to get these bits going.  So, there you go.  All right.  It's wake up your spouse Wednesday.  So far, we got a blowtorch and a guy screaming.  Just screaming.  That was an obnoxious scream.  It really was.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Chaz Palminteri.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:01:30]  You're right about that.  I don't know if anyone else is going to care, but now watching, yeah, checking out Scarface  just recently, and it just doesn't...  I remember when that movie first came out, Pacino, Scarface, it rolled.  You were like, you got to see this movie.  It's intense.  It's great.  And then you watch it now.  It's kind of funny to watch now.  You know, you watch Pacino doing the bad accent and the bad sound effects.  You're watching the gunfire. 
[02:02:00]  The sounds of the guns sucked.  It takes you out of the picture.  No blood, really.  No digital sound back then.  Yeah, there's no real good blood thing.  Remember how horrific the whole chainsaw scene was?  Yeah.  When it first came out, they get Tony's buddy there, brother, whoever the hell it was,  and chop him up in the bathtub.  You didn't see anything.  Really wasn't that good.  Just thought, you know, you see these movies that were really cool years ago, and now they  just don't stand the test of time. 
[02:02:30]  I got another one for you.  Rocky.  Saw Rocky recently.  It's an Academy Award winning picture.  This would have been an independent film if it came out today.  There was like one, maybe let's say three sets in the whole movie, five or six characters.  The fight scenes, remember when the movie first came out, it was like they made a huge  deal out of it?  Yeah.  The fighting in the movie was maybe a total of ten minutes.  Yeah.  It just, they don't hold up.  But at the time, it was the best thing out there.  Like, God damn, this is a great movie. 
[02:03:00]  That's why it's great when you see some of these classics being remade.  Yeah.  Like, for example, the obvious one, Planet of the Apes.  It's like a lot of action.  You know that a lot of people were up in arms because there was supposed to be like a  bestiality scene?  Yeah, I know.  They cut it out.  That's, what?  Will you stop listening to these PC people and create in Hollywood?  What's wrong with the bestiality scene?  As far as, like, Planet of the Apes goes?  If the guy wants to have sex with the ape, what's the problem there? 
[02:03:30]  I hear it's already happening over in India, Hopi.  What?  Monkey Man.  Have you heard of Monkey Man?  This story's sweeping the nation.  You know what?  I gotta say this.  I think you guys are pulling my leg.  No, no, stop it!  See, I pride myself and I try to read a lot before we come in here.  Hopi, if I could turn this around.  Look at a whole column on Drudge here dedicated to Monkey Man.  Now there's a picture of one of Monkey Man's victims. 
[02:04:00]  Monkey Monster's drama goes on.  Four hurt in the latest attack.  Police predict more attacks.  Monkey Man attacks cause hysteria.  Second death reported.  Six more deaths.  Panic in suburban New Delhi.  There is a Monkey Man on the loose.  In India. 
[02:04:30]  The Monkey Man of Ghazi Bad is now in Delhi.  I'm a pretty 15 monkey.  I'm a little jungle.  And he continues his attacking spree.  I'm a little Italian.  I'm a little lemon squeezer.  Now they're worried about the bacteria for Monkey Man's saliva getting into their blood. 
[02:05:00]  I can toast the rabbit machine.  You've been had, my friend.  No, there's Monkey Man.  Monkey Man's running around in India doing what to who?  Biting people and eating them.  And eating them.  See, in India, let me give you a little info on India.  There's so many people in India and they're so poor that they have a bunch of these little old falling down buildings but they don't have enough room.  And it's very hot and sweltering so a lot of people sleep on the roofs of their buildings over in India.  It's common practice. 
[02:05:30]  You go up to the roof.  Yeah, there's no air conditioning.  They get up in their rooms.  They throw it out the window.  They're like Monkey Man.  So they sleep on the roofs.  All of a sudden, here comes Monkey Man.  He's been described as, he has the body of a man, Opie, but the face and head of a monkey.  And claws.  And claws.  And he grabs people and starts eating them as they sleep.  And then everybody yells, oh my God, it's Monkey Man.  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:06:00]  And then they chase him away.  Sometimes.  Sometimes he stays and nibbles on people a little more.  Here's the deal.  If Monkey Man was here in America, we'd be like, yeah, okay, Monkey Man.  See, like Opius.  Yeah, Monkey Man.  Whatever.  In India, they believe so much that Monkey Man's there that when people now yell, oh, Monkey Man, Monkey Man, people jump off the roofs.  They've had two deaths of people that have fallen.  A pregnant woman was running so scared she ran flat into a wall and fell down the stairs and killed herself. 
[02:06:30]  Because she thought Monkey Man was chasing her?  They yelled Monkey Man.  This is coming from people that think cows are sacred.  Right.  Another guy, he's sleeping on the roof.  Monkey Man goes to attack him.  He gets up.  He hears, Monkey Man, Monkey Man, and runs right off the roof.  Falls to his death.  And other people have been killed by Monkey Man himself.  Now, how do you explain Monkey Man?  Well, I'm reading the article that you gave me in front of me that I think is completely fake, but okay, I'll go with it. 
[02:07:00]  It's fake.  It's all over the news.  The Hindu Times says Monkey Man is an alien or a robot.  It's not a robot.  That's ridiculous.  The mystery creature spread terror from 8 p.m. on Monday to 7 a.m. on Tuesday.  Its attacks became more furious.  Terrorized people kept calling for police's help, but the Monkey Man outwitted the cops and struck at will, Opie.  Tension was writ large on the faces of the residents of Selimpur, Karjijarkaz, and Maharajigala Marpar, and the Krishna Nagar. 
[02:07:30]  You know, maybe if they ate beef, they wouldn't slur their words.  Maybe.  Side dish.  They've had many complaints of attacks from this mysterious animal, Monkey Man, Opie.  Monkey Man.  More news coming in on Monkey Man.  The short, dark, hairy object with human legs and an ape-like face scratches people sleeping on the rooftops, injuring them on their heads and hands, and disappearing as soon as people try to catch it. 
[02:08:00]  Well, Anthony, here's a question from an official in India.  Yeah.  Can you ever believe a monkey prancing around in a jacket and jeans with glistening cat-like eyes and an ability to vanish into thin air?  Oh, believe it.  It's struck at 50 places since Monday night, injuring 16 people, and mocking at intensive patrolling carried out by clueless police.  Clueless police.  We will get the monkey men. 
[02:08:30]  The keystone cops.  I don't know if he comes out at a full moon.  The mysterious Tarzan struck, yeah, over 50 times.  Let's see what happened here.  A woman suffered scratches on the hand, neck, nose, head.  It got her while she was asleep.  She felt something scratching her neck.  She turned to see what was there.  I could not see anything except a figure which had red and blue bulb on his body.  I tried to resist, but I was thrown down the stairs and received head injury. 
[02:09:00]  The residents next door went through almost the same experience.  Three of them suffered scratches on the head.  Opie, monkey man is real.  Miles.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I actually heard it on NPR this morning.  I was listening for some strange reason.  Ah, see?  They had this kid on who was saying that it had metal hands and weird eyes, and it attacked  him while he was sleeping.  I have one question for you, by the way.  Yes.  The Bourbon Deli, is that where, like, all the sidewalk squares that they sleep on have 
[02:09:30]  little patches of lawn?  Very good, Miles.  Thank you.  The monkey man is said to have three buttons on his chest.  Those are the bulbs.  One to turn himself into a man, one for invisibility, and one for extra strength, Opie.  Those are monkey man's buttons, the buttons of strength and invisibility.  The hell are they smoking over there in India?  India rocks.  Where can I get some?  Carlos.  Yeah.  Hey.  I'm thinking what they need to do is to make an urgent plea over to Japan to Nintendo to 
[02:10:00]  send Mario and Luigi out there.  I think if we send over barrels to throw down on the monkey off of very rickety scaffolding  with seesaw devices and conveyor belts, we could defeat monkey man.  We don't have a problem here.  Dylan knows how to stop the monkey man from attacking you.  Dylan.  Dylan.  Hey, I actually know a way to stop the monkey man from attacking you.  Yeah.  Throw him a basketball.  Oh.  Another one. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, Lou, you're just back from India?  Yeah.  And?  Yeah, and people are freaked out about it over there.  They're saying that these carts are going on all over the place, in some of the more rural  or, you know, underlying areas or a section.  You ever see some people from India, though, that you say, oh my God, that guy's got more  hair on his face.  Like, the hairline goes from the top of the eyelid all the way across the head.  The sideburns come down to the corners of their mouth.  And right under their eyes starts their beard. 
[02:11:00]  Are you trying to say they all look like Eddie Munster?  Eddie Munster.  Eddie monkey man.  All right, guys.  Take care.  You talk.  All right.  All of you laugh, but it's the beginning of the planet of the apes.  How do you think it starts?  How?  It starts with a single monkey man.  Before you know it, you're the planet of apes.  What do you think? 
[02:11:30]  All of a sudden, apes pop up everywhere.  No.  It starts with a single monkey man.  A single monkey man.  That red thing wasn't a bulb.  It was red mandrelash.  He says, you've got a red ass, like a monkey.  And then they evolve, adapt, and start talking English.  At least they did at Planet of the Apes for some strange reason.  Monkey man's real.  Do not deny him.  Whoa.  Nova.  Nova. 
[02:12:00]  Monkey man is real.  Do not think different.  It starts with monkey man.  If I could quote Jimmy the Greek.  Monkey man was bred with his monkey woman.  A big black buck.  Monkey man.  Bred with monkey woman.  This is coming from Jimmy the Greek.  Shut up.  Because it made the better athlete.  And why are monkey men now getting the coaching jobs? 
[02:12:30]  We used to have coaches and quarterbacks.  If I could use a baseball analogy.  Monkey man, it's the bottom of the ninth and you got two strikes against you.  I'm talking about the Indian monkey man.  Of course you are.  Monkey man, I have zero here.  I'm going to rape her unless you do what I say.  John Montone, yes.  John.  Hey. 
[02:13:00]  Uh-oh.  Maybe something's wrong with our phones.  There's something wrong with our phones.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Damn, see.  You denied monkey man and now he's in the wires.  They pull wires out like little monkeys.  Because he's a monkey.  John.  Damn monkey.  Hello.  We lost it.  I knew it.  Hello.  Okay.  Until we get him through, I'll sing a song.  I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  I put him in the bathtub to see if he could swim.  He ate up.  Drank up all the water.  He ate up all the soap.  He died with a bubble in his throat. 
[02:13:30]  Do the monkey song, Claire.  Maybe they need to give monkey man some Zoloft.  Zoloft.  You know.  Monkey man, take the Zoloft to keep from clawing y'all.  Well, there's some advice for monkey man coming in on the phone, Opie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, phones finally work.  Monkey man, don't take a lie detector test. 
[02:14:00]  Don't diss any bitches you kill.  And don't watch the TV monkey man.  We're the stink.  We're the stink.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  92.3. </pre>
