<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone call from a suicidal man, Mark, who claimed to have consumed alcohol and ten muscle relaxers.  The hosts, initially engaging with him, questioned his sincerity, their attention frequently diverted by the arrival of a Ms. Pac-Man machine. Suspecting exaggeration, they offered Mark Tool concert tickets in exchange for his address to ensure his safety.  This resulted in a chaotic scene as listeners, alerted by the broadcast, converged on Mark's location, prompting police involvement.  Mark was ultimately taken away by ambulance, and the Tool tickets were awarded to Dan, a listener who was first on the scene. Jim Norton was present in studio throughout this segment.

The show then transitioned to a prolonged and increasingly absurd argument with frequent caller "Limo Anthony," culminating in Limo Anthony agreeing to be a human dartboard for promotional plugs.  This segment involved multiple guests, including Mitch from *Survivor*, comedian Stephen Lynch, and Mike DiNicola, who recounted his experiences with terrible radio spots in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Limo Anthony sustained minor injuries and bleeding during the dart-throwing ordeal.

Next, Garrett Morris was interviewed to promote his movie *Jackpot*.  This conversation took unexpected turns, including discussions of Morris's past experiences, a physical description of a guest, and a humorous, albeit offensive, exchange about race.

Following this, a listener-generated segment focused on creating a morbidly humorous menu for an NRA-themed restaurant, featuring items like "Eric Harris Hot Potato" and dishes named after various mass murderers and political figures.  Comedian Lewis Black then joined the studio, leading to a discussion of his dry cleaning woes and clothing style, before transitioning into the "Has-Been Corner" segment featuring Cindy Williams. This interview became unexpectedly tense, with Williams reacting negatively to her portrayal.  The hosts expressed discomfort with the segment's outcome following overwhelmingly negative caller reactions.  The show then played a series of alleged 911 prank calls made by O.J. Simpson.

The final segment involved a “hot wax” stunt with female guest Jill, and Ann applying the wax.  The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive comments about Jill's body, and a lit match was thrown near her.  A photographer, Rick, documented the event.  Ice packs were applied after the waxing.  The broadcast was punctuated throughout with frequent laughter from the hosts and callers.

And I'd love to talk to you guys before I die.  What's the matter, dude?  Why do you want to do that?  Well, girlfriend left me.  Well, I've got dumped, too.  So what?  You just move on.  It sucks, but you move on.  Your girlfriend dumped you, so you decided to take some muscle relaxers?  Dude, dude.  I'm sorry.  I did not mean to curse.  Hey, you don't want to curse when you last a couple of minutes on earth. 
[00:01:00]  I know that.  I look at you guys every day.  Hey, don't curse.  I mean, you're going to ruin your life.  Don't ruin ours.  What'd you take?  What'd you take, really?  Hey, I drank a cup of vodka.  Yeah.  I just had four shots of black house.  Yeah.  And I took ten of these muscle relaxers that I got prescribed to me a couple months ago.  For what?  My back.  Read the label.  What's the actual name of the drug?  Do you want me to read them?  Go ahead.  Let me turn off my air conditioner because it's, like, too noisy. 
[00:01:30]  Hey, we...  No, you don't want to stink.  If no one finds you, leave that AC blasting.  All right.  I...  Go ahead.  Read the label.  Read the label.  It says, may cause drowsiness.  Alcohol may intensify this effect.  What's the name of the actual thing?  Methacarbamol.  What?  Methacarbamol.  Methacarbamol.  Spell that.  M-E-T-H.  E-T-H. 
[00:02:00]  O-C.  O-C.  A-R.  A-R.  B-A-M-O-L.  All right.  All right.  Let me see that.  And where do you live, Mark?  Rick?  I live in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, right?  Philly.  You live in where?  Haddon Heights, New Jersey.  All right.  Right out of Philly.  Right out of Philly?  Yes.  All right.  And what's your last name?  Mark? 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  What's your last name?  I'm going to give my last name a year.  What?  I don't think I should give my last name.  Ah, then you're cool.  You don't want to die.  All right.  How long were you dating this chick for?  How long were you dating this chick for?  Yeah.  How long were you dating this chick for?  Yeah.  Mark?  Are you falling asleep?  No, but I'm sick.  Mark, you...  What are you on your cell phone?  You're on a cell phone in front.  Which means you're in a car or something.  Mark? 
[00:03:00]  I'm in front of my house.  You're in front of your house?  I'm on a phone in my house.  What?  Cell phone.  Hold on.  What do you think?  He's got no cell phone in his house.  Should we save his life or let him die?  What do we do?  Well, I got distracted because our Ms. Pac-Man machine arrived.  Oh, thank God.  All right.  Screw this.  Woo!  Think I'm kidding?  Did you see that guy wheeled a Ms. Pac-Man machine past the studio door?  We're going retro around here.  Thank God. 
[00:03:30]  We got the foosball table?  Oh, is that dedicated to our little friend on the phone?  Is he still here?  Hello?  Mark?  Yeah.  You're full of crap.  You're on a cell phone.  I know I'm on a cell phone.  All right.  Why are you on a cell phone?  Because I don't have a home phone.  You don't have a home phone?  No.  I owe Verizon too much money.  All right.  Is that why you're going to try to off yourself?  Well, dude, dude, this girl is just like, I was doing bad.  I was in a poor living situation, and this girl gets me into an apartment, got me a really 
[00:04:00]  good job, and now she wants to leave me.  What's the, um...  I thought you said she left you.  She's leaving me.  She's in the process of leaving me.  How long are you dating her?  Six months.  Six months?  And you're going to kill yourself for some broad of you nuts?  Six months?  Yeah, I love her.  Don't stop it.  I love my ex-girlfriend too.  Who cares if she's living or dead?  How old did you say he was?  How old are you?  Um, I turned 21 on Saturday.  Ah, geez, dude, that's a little too young to off yourself. 
[00:04:30]  Look at Mr. Tools.  He's still hanging on to life with his artificial heart.  He sees value in it.  Dude, if you're a Met fan and you kill yourself, I almost understand.  But if some broad after six months dumps, you have, come on, stop.  Just move on.  I guess I should die, because I am a Met fan.  All right, well.  All right, Mark.  We think you're full of crap, man.  What's the...  I know you...  Oh, hey, listen.  I know you guys...  I'm just...  I'm out here for an intention getter.  But the whole thing is, if I do die, I don't know if I will die.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  I just wanted to talk to you guys, because I think you guys are totally awesome.  All right.  All right, Mark.  Well, maybe you should, like, tell us what street you're at so we can save your life.  Yeah, save your life.  And, dude, you're not 21.  It's illegal for you to be drinking.  I am 21.  Oh, okay.  I turned 21.  Hey, Mark.  I'm going to say 10.  Mark, if we save your life, we will give you tool tickets.  They're coming to Philly.  You want to do that?  We'll trade your life for a pair of tickets.  How's that?  Tool? 
[00:05:30]  It seems pretty cool.  Yeah.  Right?  All right.  What do I got to do?  All right.  Hold on.  And then we're going to need your address to send you the tickets, though.  All right.  You promise me you'll send me tool tickets?  We promise we will give you tool tickets.  Yeah, but we have to give you our address out so someone can save your life, and then  we'll give you the tool tickets.  See?  See how that works?  All right.  I just don't want to give my address on the air, though.  All right.  Give it off the air.  All right.  Who do I got to talk to?  But we need to send someone over there.  Just get his town name and call them. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  What town are you in?  I'm in Haddon Heights.  And you took, what, 10 muscle relaxers?  Yeah.  And lots of alcohol in you?  Well, I drank about a...  Oh, you keep breaking up, dude.  We want to save your life, but we've got to make it sound good for the radio.  All right.  Do you hear...  Don't make him work for it.  Right.  This isn't Rich Voss, is it?  You almost hear him talking over the big teeth of his.  Yeah.  Who's in the studio right now, bro?  What?  Yeah, it's Jim Norton. 
[00:06:30]  Jim Norton's in the studio.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Mark, all right.  Who can we call to, like, save your life and then we'll give you the tool tickets?  Because we've got to be able to save your life to give you the tickets.  Someone is saying...  Someone is saying...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Rachel wants it on this.  Rachel.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up?  You tell me.  Nothing.  I want tool tickets.  The kid's not going to die.  Oh, it...  Throw yourself in front of the bus.  Look at this.  Now there's people going, he's not going to die.  Give me the tool tickets.  See, that people are trying to take your life for tool tickets. 
[00:07:00]  That's so great.  Mark, I might have to give the tool tickets to someone else.  They say you're not going to die.  You don't really sound close to death's door.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to curse.  They'll get it down the hall.  You don't sound as close to death's door as you would if you drank so much vodka and took  ten muscle relaxers.  All I know is I just want this, like, emotional pain to go away.  All right.  Give out your address on the air.  If a guy stops in front of your house and sees you in the car on the cell phone and can verify  that it's you, I'll give you tool tickets. 
[00:07:30]  That means I have to go outside then because I'm inside my living room.  You said you were outside the house before.  I said I'm inside.  Oh, all right.  You're breaking up.  Well, yeah.  I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  You go outside on your front lawn.  You give your address.  First guy that shows up that can verify that it's you.  Then we'll give you the tool ticket.  Then you get the tool tickets.  All right.  Hold on one second.  All right.  Are you there?  Yeah.  What do you got to do?  And if you don't want people to know you're dressed, then, like, go to the, you know,  go to the corner and give us the, you know.  Give us the corner you're on. 
[00:08:00]  Right.  All right.  What corner of?  What?  Hold on.  He's going to give the corner.  I don't have a better reception in a minute.  Wait a minute.  He's going outside.  He's going outside?  He's going outside?  Like a better reception.  Could you get a new cell phone plan before you die?  This stinks.  My cell phone sucks.  Never buy a Motorola.  All right.  So where are you going now, Mark?  I'm going outside.  I have better reception.  What?  He's got a reception.  Never buy a Motorola, he said.  Con, I know you're ready to drop dead and all, but we're doing a radio show here. 
[00:08:30]  Snap it up.  Right.  Don't sound so depressed.  If we're going to save you, we've got to save you before the commercial break.  Yeah.  Yeah, this isn't sponsored, you know.  Yeah.  This guy's suicide.  Sponsored by Sam Arnie Goatweed.  That's a great ad for Sam Arnie.  Hey, Mark.  All right, where are you?  Hey, did you guys hear me?  Yeah.  Now we can hear you.  Nice.  All right, because I'm like outside now.  I'm by my truck.  All right, you're by your truck.  What street are you on?  Well, I don't want to give my exact address, but I'll give you the cross street. 
[00:09:00]  All right.  Give the cross street.  Here's how it's going to work.  You're going to give a cross street.  Okay.  Someone that's in that area is going to drive by.  Then we will talk to that person and talk to you, and you'll get the tool ticket.  And guess what?  The person that shows up first to save Mark's life will also get tool tickets.  How about that?  Mark?  I'm on the corner of the Black Horse Pike.  Wait, wait, hold on.  It crapped out.  Say it again.  I'm on the corner of the Black Horse Pike. 
[00:09:30]  Black Horse Pike.  Uh-huh.  Black Horse Pike is the name of the street?  Yeah.  Yes.  Okay.  Also known as Route 168.  Okay.  And Narbeth Avenue in Haddon Heights.  And Narbeth Avenue.  All right.  First person that gets there and saves his life and gives us a little lowdown on what's going on.  Gets tool tickets, and you get tool tickets.  And you'll get tool tickets as well, Mark.  Unless you're dead already, then we are not obligated to give you the tool tickets. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say I do die.  Yeah.  You're not going to die.  If you just gave out those two streets, you're fine now.  Why?  Honestly, I want to die because I just want the pain to go away.  Oh, it'll go away.  Tool is great.  Dude, you know what's going to happen?  You know, don't...  In a year or two, not even you're going to look back and go, God, was I a dick.  If we give you the tool tickets, and then you off yourself before the tool show, there's 
[00:10:30]  going to be a lot of pissed off people there.  Pretty pissed.  Yeah.  Because then, you know, someone else could have gone to tool.  All right.  Did you really give those streets?  What was that?  Those were the real streets?  I swear to God.  Black Horse, Pike, and Narbeth Avenue.  I'm standing right on the corner.  All right.  Know what sucks about this?  There's a long delay, so it's going to take a while before people get the address.  Yeah, it's going to take a while for Philly to get out there right now.  You guys have a...  It's about five minutes away. 
[00:11:00]  Five minutes outside Philly?  All right.  Oh, by the way...  Yeah, I'm about ten minutes outside Philly.  All right.  Hold on.  By the way, tool's going to be at the First Union Center Thursday, September 27th.  Tickets go on sale this Saturday at 10 a.m.  I love this show.  Through Ticketmaster.  Hold on.  I want to see if Sean's close.  Hold on.  First person that shows up will get tool tickets, and Mark will get them as well.  Sean.  Sean.  Are you close to where he's at?  Yeah, I'm on King's Highway.  I'm heading up towards Black Horse Pike.  I'm about two minutes from Black Horse Pike.  All right.  First person there will get the tool tickets. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  Cool.  Hey, do me a favor.  Yeah.  Ask me if I make a right or a left on the Black Horse Pike.  I can't remember them.  Mark.  Are you coming from Belmar or Haddonfield?  Haddonfield.  He sounds pretty lucid now.  You're going to make a left.  There you are.  I want to make a what?  Is that you right?  Yeah, yeah.  Someone just pulled up.  All right.  Hold on.  A little red escort.  Uh-oh.  Someone pulled up in a Volkswagen right now.  All right.  Well, then, Sean, we'll have to let you go.  Do you want those first bags?  Someone else showed up already. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Go back to Mark, who is sounding very lucid now.  What's going on with that?  Hey, Mark.  Mark, you sounded a lot more effed up before.  Okay.  Yeah.  Someone just showed up on the corner here.  Is it a Volkswagen?  Yeah.  All right.  Give them the phone.  All right.  They want to open up.  They want to talk to you.  All right.  Tell them to drive away with his phone.  No.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  What's your name, man?  Hey, this is Dan.  Dan.  How effed up does this guy look? 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Somebody else just pulled up.  What's up?  Does this guy look effed up?  Uh, he looks pretty whacked.  He looks pretty whacked?  Yeah.  His eyes are all messed up.  Are they?  Um, ask him to show you the bottle of pills.  You got the bottle of pills, man?  Hey, you got the bottle?  What's that?  They want to see the bottle.  I got to run up to my apartment.  All right.  You want to wait while he runs up?  I'm going to pull up to his parking lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can do that.  This is who you want to save in your life, too.  Some retired O&A listener. 
[00:13:00]  Hey, Dan.  I don't know.  There's some other guy here, I guess.  I don't know.  There's going to be a lot of people there in a few minutes.  Dan.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Yo.  Are you a huge Tool fan?  Yeah, I sure am.  You were the first person on the scene to save Mark's life, so you got a pair of tickets  to see Tool at the First Union Center Thursday, September 27th.  Tickets go on sale Saturday.  How do I collect those?  All right.  You'll stay on the line.  I'll give you my cell phone number, too, because this guy is terrible.  Yeah.  Hold on.  We'll figure it all out. 
[00:13:30]  But we just want to make sure this guy is going to be all right, man.  All right.  Let's go through some of the overdose symptoms of methicarmamol.  All right.  Nausea.  He's not whack.  Do I still get the tickets?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  So, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, headache, severe weakness, fainting, breathing  difficulties, irritability.  He just kind of looked like he was sweating.  Seizures.  Feeling of paralysis.  Profuse sweating.  Is he sweating?  Yeah, he just...  I wouldn't say profuse.  He was wearing, like, a black T-shirt and stuff, though.  He was out here sweating. 
[00:14:00]  Some other...  Some guy just ran up with him.  He looks pretty effed up, though.  Uh...  Not really.  I mean, I wouldn't call, like, 911 if, you know...  Right, right.  Wow.  You wouldn't believe...  I guess you probably wouldn't believe how many people are out here.  He better be dying.  Wow.  Yeah, they hate to think we saved somebody who didn't need to be saved.  These toll tickets are very valuable for our radio show.  Yeah, and we're just giving them all right.  Oh, wait.  I said there's about 10 guys in the apartment.  Oh, he won't let anybody out.  Oh, here he comes.  All right.  He's coming back out?  Uh, he's got the bottle of vodka. 
[00:14:30]  Does he have the pills on him, though?  He got the pills on you?  Let me shoot out a phone real quick.  Let me talk to them real quick.  Cops here.  Hang on, hang on.  Oh, the cops are there.  There you go.  Yeah.  Good.  Let me talk to them.  I want those toll tickets.  Now I got the police here.  Ah, there you go.  Well, good.  I guess they want the phone.  That's fine.  Make sure you get me back for those tickets.  Hang on.  All right.  We got to take care of Dan and Mark.  Hey, police guys.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Where's the other guy?  Hello.  You cop? 
[00:15:00]  Hello.  All right.  We got the cops there.  Over here, guys.  Hello.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, why don't we just do a road show in that neighborhood now?  Yeah.  Sounds like a lot of fans in that neck of the woods.  We got enough people there.  Hey, what's going on?  Somebody better tell us what's happening there.  Hello.  We'll get there.  We're a little fossil.  Well, I don't think he's going to die.  He agreed to get his ex-girlfriend and hit a wow.  Ah, that's awful.  Wouldn't that be nice?  All we can find is the last number, isn't it? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, I want you.  I'm trying to listen in at the good phone.  All right, listen.  Who's got the phone?  Yeah, no one's talking on the phone.  They're just holding it up.  Who's got the cell phone?  Hello?  Someone with a cell phone in the area.  Please give the show a call.  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  Hello?  Hello.  Hello, officers.  I have to get any time.  No? 
[00:16:00]  I'm here.  My name is.  I don't know.  What's that?  Mike says, just tell him to J.O.  That might help.  Can't hurt.  Can't hurt any situation.  Ever.  Ever.  Why do they grab the cell phone and they're not talking to us?  I don't know.  Officer.  Officer.  I'm feeling really good about the fact that, you know,  a new city, Opie, and the cops showed up so quickly.  That's good.  I'm feeling love.  Where's your idea?  Oh, the rouse.  Now they're rousting them. 
[00:16:30]  Where's your idea?  Who's got the phone with Y.S.T.?  I love you.  You were.  You're the one, right?  To crush up your girlfriend?  Yeah.  Okay.  Come on over here, Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Bob, what do you think, L.P.?  Come here.  You think he's going to make it?  What do you think, Bob?  Always time for a platoon reference.  We're going to make sure, okay?  I don't believe you.  I understand, okay?  If you need some help, we'll get you some help. 
[00:17:00]  Okay?  Yeah.  All right?  Hold on.  You came, brother.  I'm Martin.  All right, Mark.  Have a seat in the car.  Sean.  Yo.  What's happening?  Yo, man.  You would not believe how many cops are here, guys.  Really?  You would not believe.  There's got to be about ten cops here.  You're the one on the phone with Y.S.T., right?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, Sean, what's going on?  You have to be all right.  Well, they pulled the one guy aside, and they pulled the guy who showed up first aside,  and they're, like, questioning both of them.  And I don't think that guy, Mark,'s messed up at all, dude. 
[00:17:30]  Well, he is now.  Geez.  Now he is.  What's that?  They hung up the other phone.  Sean, you still there?  Yeah, I'm still here.  All right.  They hung up the other phone.  So you've got to describe what's happening.  Yeah.  How many?  Well, you've got about four or five undercover cops here.  You've got three marked units.  Yeah.  We've got some detectives.  Mm-hmm.  What they're doing right now is they're questioning the guy who showed up first, 
[00:18:00]  and he's sitting here in a silver Volkswagen.  They pulled him out of the car and are questioning.  Oh, that poor guy just showed up.  The guy who called in, and Mark, I guess, he's, like, nowhere around.  I don't even know where he went.  Well, when they got out of jail, they're going to tour.  I think the guy was joshing you, man.  They put him in the car, I think.  No, the guy that originally made the call and said he was killing himself, is he there?  I think he is, because what I heard on the phone.  I don't see him, though, dude.  But I think they took him in the car, because what I heard from the other cell phone was  the cop asking him, are you the guy with the girlfriend that originally called YSP? 
[00:18:30]  And he said yes, and he goes, okay, Bob.  I'm right there, Bob.  Get in the car, Bob.  Why are you telling yourself, Jewish?  What do you think, Al-P?  Sean, that's what I thought.  They got a cell phone here.  I don't know.  Sean, how many cars are there now?  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  I've got a bad feeling about this one, Bob.  I was just showing up to see if this guy was, like, telling the truth.  I live right down the street.  Okay.  And I was just listening to the radio show.  What did you see?  Nothing.  I just saw the guy over there in a silver car.  He was talking to guys on the radio.  And the guy came out, and you guys showed up. 
[00:19:00]  Where did he come out from?  Right over here on the right-hand side.  He was over in the air?  Yeah.  Like I said, I don't know.  I don't know.  Was he in the vehicle?  No, I have no idea whether he was in a vehicle or not.  Like I said, I just pulled up, like, two seconds before you got to get up.  Just happened to go up.  Yeah.  I live in Haddon Heights, so I figured I'd just come on over and see what was going on.  Did you guys hear that?  Yeah.  See, I can see what's going to happen here.  It seems to me like the cops are going to start to think maybe we, like it was a bit.  No, there's no bit. 
[00:19:30]  The guy called up out of nowhere.  Oh, boy.  Right.  I think they're actually going to arrest this guy.  How could they arrest him?  He called up?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I mean, they're looking to see if he was driving, to see where he lived, or...  Why, is being a horse's ass illegal?  I mean, you got firefighters, EMTs here.  Well, you know something?  The guy calls us up.  He says he drank vodka, Black House, which is really good, by the way, and took 10 muscle relaxers.  Well, you know, I think it's our civic duty to, well, let him die. 
[00:20:00]  Make sure the guy isn't BSing.  You have to.  Yeah, right?  There you go.  If he's being a tool and calling up a report like that to us, I don't know what legal ramifications  there are.  Can you look it up?  Hey, isn't I hooking you guys up?  Can I get the tool tickets anyway?  Yeah, what the heck?  Yeah, we can do it.  I love you guys, man.  I listen to you, like, every day.  Yeah, I think we got some, don't we?  Yeah, hold on.  We can give Sean some tool tickets.  Because Mark might be busy the day.  You guys are so cool. 
[00:20:30]  Thanks, man.  How many people are there now?  Well, we got one, two, three undercover, a couple detectives, one, two, three marked cars.  Don from East Meadow saying he should have hid under the kiddie pool on the lawn, like  that guy did in Cops.  You never hide under the kiddie pool.  He's a businessman above a business.  Really?  And now there's a couple of them going inside to see what's going on, I guess.  I'm glad to see that the cops listened to us in the Philly area. 
[00:21:00]  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, right.  I think, actually, somebody might have called him.  Steve.  Steve, you in the area?  Steve, what's up, man?  Yeah, man, across the street.  All right, what's going on?  The dude was talking on the phone, calling you guys.  Dude, he looked fine, man.  I think he was just being a tool, trying to get some tickets.  He sounded out of it.  I mean, I think he should take his tickets, and he's kind of inconvenient for me, because  I'm late for work now.  A lot of people in the area right now?  About 10, 15 people.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not that bad.  I mean, it's a bad time to do it, though, you know what I mean?  Well, the thing is, it wasn't a ticket giveaway. 
[00:21:30]  Like, we didn't even mention that we were going to give anybody anything.  We just said, if you get the information, we'll give us some information.  It was a way to get him to get out of his name.  Hey, Sean, can you see the guy?  Yeah, I saw him.  He was wearing, like, a black shirt.  They got him in the back of the squad car right now.  All right.  And they're questioning the guy that pulled up first in that Volkswagen who got there  first.  Working him over with a phone book?  Yeah, they're questioning the guy that pulled up first.  Wait, the guy that pulled up first?  He's sitting there, like, around, like everyone's standing there. 
[00:22:00]  Wait, who's this?  Who's this?  Kevin?  Yeah.  You're checking it out, too?  Yeah.  All right.  If the cops are listening to the broadcast, the first guy that pulled up was just pulling  up to make sure this guy was okay.  He'll get to the bottom of that.  All right, all right.  It's not like these are the same people that run around throwing bombs into buildings.  Dude, it looked like they're actually tearing him in a new ass.  Come on.  Yeah.  What are they doing?  They're tearing him in a new ass.  They're yelling and screaming at him in the back of the patrol car?  Well, they got one of the head firefighters.  He's in there, and he looks like he's tearing him in a new ass. 
[00:22:30]  Like, what the F is wrong with you?  The guy that called Ferns is walking towards us right now.  All right.  Get him on the phone.  Tell him you're on the radio with us.  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  They want to talk to you.  This is so funny.  Dude, what happened?  Is this Dan?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  You're the guy that pulled up first to see if this guy was BS or not.  Yeah, run us through everything.  If you want it.  All right.  Run us through everything that just happened.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Because there's so much going on.  Kevin and Sean, you're still on the line, but just don't say a word. 
[00:23:00]  Let Dan talk.  Dan.  Yes.  All right.  Tell us what happened after you gave the phone to the cop.  After I gave the phone to the cops, they took Mark, and they're talking to him right  now.  I'm going to pull up.  All right.  And what do they say to you?  Well, at first, I don't know.  At first, I thought they were going to jack me up or something.  They didn't know what was going on, but they're cool now.  They just took my knee down, and then we were here with these guys.  Do you want to come up?  What are they doing with the perp?  Dan.  The perp?  I don't know.  There's a bunch of people on the phone around here. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, I know.  They're all calling us.  They're helping us out here.  I hope you got a lot of cool figures.  No.  No.  Hey, Dan.  Yeah.  Now, does it look like this guy's effed up or not?  Yeah.  Now that I've looked at him a little bit, he does.  He definitely looks effed up?  He's a little too relaxed between the back of the police car.  Are they going to take him away, you think, the ambulance?  I think so.  You think they're taking him away?  I think they're trying to get him help.  I don't think they're...  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  Even if you're goofing around like that, maybe you should talk to somebody. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, it was stupid.  I mean, they have to do something with him.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Hold on, everyone.  Hold on.  Sean.  You.  What's going on?  Well, they brought him out in handcuffs after they went up in the apartment.  They brought down a yellow bag.  They put him in the back of an ambulance.  Oh, they did?  I think they might have taken him to the hospital, probably detoxing.  Well, that means something was going on, because if they were going to take him away  and they didn't think it was serious, they would have just thrown him in the back of  a police car.  Yeah.  Pretty much everybody else is clearing out, though.  All the cops are pretty much going around. 
[00:24:30]  So the ambulance arrived, and is he in the back of the ambulance right now?  No.  They just left.  The ambulance just left.  Can't we get a statement from one of the cops?  I don't know.  Hold on a second.  Yeah, ask one of the cops.  Why'd they cuff him?  Oh, so he doesn't hurt himself.  They didn't have a...  Why'd they cuff you, Norton?  Criminal.  Hold on a second.  I'm, like, chasing, like, all of them here.  Excuse me, I'm a kid.  Can I talk to you for a second?  One of the guys who wrote a radio show, I want to talk to you guys. 
[00:25:00]  Can you see if he made me give a statement?  No.  No.  You think he'll be all right, though?  Pretty much.  Yeah.  He said he can't give a statement.  All right.  NYPD would have given us one.  Yeah.  Come on.  Philly's finest going to have to work on the relationship with the L.P. and Anthony show.  NYPD would have completely taken care of us.  Maybe he didn't even get a rubber dolly in the yard.  This effing jack-off with such a pull.  We threw him in the back.  By the way, the guys love you guys.  Right.  That's NYPD.  Philly.  No.  No statement. 
[00:25:30]  He's fine.  All right.  So, Sean.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Yeah.  Pretty much it.  Everybody else.  Everybody's leaving now.  All the cops are leaving.  All right.  So, they pulled him out of his apartment, put him in the back of an ambulance.  He was handcuffed and they have left the scene.  Yeah.  Okay.  I can't hear you.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  All right.  No problem, man.  All right, bro.  Well, how about that?  They've taken him away and I guess they're going to check him out.  Let's see what Dan's saying.  Dan?  I wonder what was in that bag.  Hey, Dan.  Yeah.  What's up, man? 
[00:26:00]  This is Kevin E and Dan's talking on another phone.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  So, is that pretty much what happened?  Anything else, Dan?  Yeah, we slowly drove by and we looked into the back of the ambulance and he was actually  strapped down.  Like, he was on his back.  He was strapped down pretty good?  Yeah.  They were, like, talking to him.  Like, I saw flashlights going.  I guess they were looking at his eyes or something.  Right.  Most of the cops are gone.  And he was taken out of his apartment in handcuffs.  Yeah, he was in handcuffs.  They put him in the back of the car.  The one cop looked like he was, like, about to beat him the hell up.  He was really cursing at him. 
[00:26:30]  They're like, what the hell is your problem and stuff?  Right.  And then, basically, he's just in the ambulance right now.  All right.  And they took off, right?  Yeah.  Andy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  You tell us.  What's going down?  This is not...  Well, who knew what was going to happen?  What an effing fool this kid is.  You should have just let him die.  I love you, suicide, dude.  All right.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We should take a break.  Hey, Matty, let's do a fake guy taking pills cop thing. 
[00:27:00]  This is how it happens.  It just comes out of nowhere.  What the hell is this?  It doesn't get much realer than this today, folks.  Am I the only one that now understands why his girlfriend dumped him?  This suicide attempt sponsored by Lifestyles Condom.  Opie and Anthony.  Every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon.  1027 WNEW.  Got a really good instant feedback here from Vinny from Rosedale, who helps with the show  every day. 
[00:27:30]  Hey, guys.  I have a new nickname for your stalkers.  Why are you looking at me?  Because you look right at me all the time.  You don't want me to come in here anymore.  I won't come in here.  Man, he's freaking out.  We didn't invite you.  Oh, leave him alone.  He's a celebrity.  He's hanging out with the Sopranos cast tonight.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  You went to Rock and Roll Cafe, wherever you are, on Monday.  Wait.  Let's back up.  You said we didn't even invite you.  You just showed up.  You act like we invite you and then we're, you know.  No, you didn't invite me.  Rick needed cars, so I came by. 
[00:28:00]  Is that okay with you?  One more plug, right?  That's all I need?  1-800-GO-VITAL?  Yeah, why don't you go by?  I can go home now.  Oh, now you owe us another car, because that's four plugs.  He acts like we invited him, and then we're treating him like crap.  No, you just showed up.  And then you're surprised when we trash you.  I'm not allowed anymore.  I used to be.  Anyway, Anthony, Vinny from Rosedale.  Yes.  Hey, guys, I have a new nickname for your stalkers, and he lists all the stalkers.  Stalker Patty, Lady Di, Marion, and Limo Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  Vinny.  You have made the stalker category.  Come to the road show tomorrow night.  Come say hello to me.  The new nickname for our stalkers, Anthony.  You ready for this one?  Yeah.  How about the retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley?  That could work.  Oh, my God.  The disgusting, retarded Charlie's Angels and Bosley.  I'm in.  Angels, I have a mission for you. 
[00:29:00]  Discussed Opie and Anthony at all costs, all the time, forever, forever, ever.  Anthony.  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  That Anthony from Vital, he don't need you guys no more.  You know, he's a big shot.  He's going on other shows on WNEW, plugging his show.  What other show you go on?  The sports guys called me the other morning.  Oh.  That's okay.  They called me, brother.  They called me.  Yeah.  I didn't call them.  Did I say it?  Well, now, you know, now you don't need them anymore.  That's not true.  You know, you're a big tough guy.  You get loud with them. 
[00:29:30]  That's all right.  Opie's letting you.  You know, he's giving you enough room to hang yourself.  What's your name?  It doesn't matter if you want my name.  You can come see me at the road show tomorrow night, too.  Oh, my God.  Come see me.  Do you want to beat people up?  Because we'll make that happen on the stage.  We'll have a punching booth.  All right.  You can just come in and punch you.  You don't have a bad ankle.  I'll try my best.  No.  You want people just to come on stage and beat you up?  No.  Listen, because you know what?  I won't come there by myself.  I'll come there with, like, 40 people I know, and we'll all pummel you together.  There you go.  Great odd.  We need, like, can we, like, I don't know.  We need to do something with him. 
[00:30:00]  I tell you, hang out with him.  Can we shoot paintballs at you on stage?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah, you can shoot paintballs at me.  I need a paintball company.  Well, wait a minute.  Well, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yes.  But am I protected at all?  My eyes.  Wait.  You get goggles and a cup.  That's it.  You're so cocky.  We're going to shoot the paintballs at you.  Shoot paintballs at me.  Shoot paintballs at me.  And he has no clue.  Dude, he doesn't.  You have no idea.  How far away?  No, I don't.  Actually, I've never been shot.  What's the matter?  We could shoot you 200 yards. 
[00:30:30]  You'd still hurt.  Is that going to hurt?  Yeah.  Uh-uh.  It'll hurt a lot.  You, um...  Well, you know, you're the one.  It's up to you guys.  You don't like me in here anymore.  If I get a free pass from now on and come in here whenever I want...  We didn't invite you.  You'll be very injured.  My last gun did 125 feet per second.  It hurts.  It hurts, man.  Did you see Jackass?  No.  Did you see what his legs looked like?  No.  It raised welts the size of half dollars and they were black.  Forget about it.  I don't feel like getting maimed.  If you're going to go far enough, I'll...  You got to know what you're getting into. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, you're a pussy.  Only in the butt.  I knew it.  Only in the butt.  In the ass?  Yeah.  You act all brave on the radio.  You're a pussy.  I'll take it.  We'll do it.  How many shots?  How many shots?  20.  Absolutely not.  You're an ass.  How about a game of asses up at the road show?  He goes how many shots?  You know what?  One shot would do it.  So then you know what?  He would fly like a little girl.  You know what?  I bet you I won't.  John, what's up?  Yeah, this guy...  The other day, I was looking to the sports guy.  I thought to him every day.  And he's on there.  And they had some guy who was coming in who was going to be all drunk and hammered. 
[00:31:30]  Matty.  Because he hadn't drunk for God knows how long.  But he was there.  And he said, oh, you know what?  I'll do you guys a favor.  I'll drive this guy home.  I'll give him my limo.  And he was plugging his company out the air.  I'm allowed.  They called me.  You got a problem with that?  No, they didn't call you.  You were there.  How do you know they didn't call me?  6.30 in the morning, they woke me up out of sleep.  All right, scum?  Whatever, man.  You're a sea dump truck.  Later.  All right, scum.  All of a sudden, he turned into T.J. Hooker.  I know.  Look how brave you are. 
[00:32:00]  Okay, scum.  No, but he doesn't know the fact.  You're busted, scum.  They woke me up at 6.30 in the morning.  I don't care if you're out of that show.  Don't have fun with them.  You're busted, scum.  They put on a good show.  I don't care.  You know what?  So what are you trying to say?  You don't want me here to go with them?  You don't want to add anything to our show, and I hope maybe they'll have better luck.  Dan from Hoboken.  Of course, Rick wants to do asses up.  God damn, Dan.  Let me get Psycho Mark on the air.  Psycho Mark.  Have you talked to your doctor about Stacker 2? 
[00:32:30]  Hey, there it is.  What's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Dude, I got my paintball gun.  I'm going to freeze some paintballs, and I'll have that thing shooting around 300 feet  per second.  You ain't doing it.  It'll leave wealth on his back like grapefruit, you know?  I got my paintball gun.  Jack, Jack, Jack.  He's backing out now.  Five shots.  I'll give you five shots.  You are such a wimp.  Why don't you stand like a man and take 20 shots right in the sack?  You know what?  Okay. 
[00:33:00]  We only need to go.  I'll take shots.  He said he'll take five shots.  Five shots will do the trick.  Yeah, but from how far away?  I know you'll be point blank.  You'll put it on my skin and shoot me.  Not only that, Mark has, like, the top-of-the-line paintball gun.  Yeah.  This thing is, like...  You have never been hit...  Five shots, I'll do it.  Have you ever been hit by a man?  No, I have not.  I'll do it.  You're so stupid.  See, this guy, Dan from Jersey, is a genius.  He actually has a solution.  Why not kill two birds with one stone?  Put the hair paint in the paintball guns and shoot Limo Anthony in the head.  So it'll stick. 
[00:33:30]  All right, guys.  We'll see you later.  All right.  People coming up with ideas for you, and we want to do one of these ideas tomorrow night.  Doug from Springfield.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, Doug.  Perfect thing for Limo Anthony.  Yeah.  Human dartboard.  No.  Oh, come on.  But you can round off the edge of the darts a little bit.  Can't throw some darts at you?  All right.  Those big lawn darts, how's that?  Hold on.  We'll make a deal.  What's a kill?  Doug, you're on to something.  I'm going to hang up on you, because we need to do some wheeling and dealing now.  Okay.  Bye.  I wasn't even coming tomorrow night.  Listen. 
[00:34:00]  I wasn't.  Listen.  Go ahead.  You need plugs for your stupid business, right?  Yeah.  That is floundering.  It's not floundering.  It's doing very well.  It's the only reason you're here, and the only reason you're starting to call the sports  guys.  Let's be honest.  Okay.  You're wrong.  If you become a human dartboard.  Go ahead.  We could negotiate here.  Okay.  Plugs for darts.  Plugs for darts.  Right, Ed?  What are we going to do, though?  Actually throw darts into them?  Yeah.  Well, protect your spine.  Oh, thanks.  I've seen this done before. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  But it's done by those guys that put the, their blockheads, that put the nails in their  nose, and put the vice grips on their nipples and whatnot.  You really want to hurt me?  No.  I want to see you, you know.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry?  I just want to see you jump around in pain for a little bit.  I'll do the paintballs.  I'll do the paintballs.  I don't think we can allow that, though, obviously.  Yeah.  Darts, though.  Very easy.  We could do it here.  Now. 
[00:35:00]  How about you take one from a potato gun?  That could kill them.  Oh, a paintball 10 feet won't.  A potato gun.  I think it's just going to be nice to me.  It just goes over the edge.  I'll take the darts.  You'll take the darts?  I'll take one dart.  How could you take a dart?  Do I get to protect myself in all my vital areas?  Man, you want to be loved.  Vital areas.  You want to be loved so bad.  I actually didn't mean to lie.  Shut up, man.  He wants to be loved so bad.  I'm surprised I didn't come in here with a bandage and an eye patch. 
[00:35:30]  You'll take darts?  I'm not even allowed in here.  My girlfriend.  Never mind.  Your girlfriend won't allow you in here?  Why?  She thinks you're over the edge.  Oh.  Hey, we got some darts right now.  Well, when she becomes of A, she'll understand what the show's all about.  She's 24.  Here, I got darts right now.  We don't have to wait for the road show.  All right.  Let me see one of those.  Oh, my gosh.  For each dart that hits your back, we'll plug your web.  Absolutely not.  Why?  One plug?  That's nothing. 
[00:36:00]  No.  There's four darts.  Ant gets two, I get two.  Give me one of those.  Let me see how the tips are.  They're not even that sharp, Ant.  Look.  Let's see.  Feel.  Oh, that's nothing.  These things are worn down.  And you said you had a hairy back.  You got enough protection.  You barely get a quarter inch in you.  Here's the deal.  Go ahead.  Here's the deal.  For each dart we throw, we plug your company.  Okay?  If we get one to stick, which is possible, and a stick is like it sticks and then falls out,  five plugs.  Five plugs for your company.  Get out of here.  Look what you're aiming at. 
[00:36:30]  What do you think?  What?  Let's do it.  We'll do it?  Yeah.  Let me go.  All right.  Someone's got to...  Honestly, someone's got to...  Whoa!  I aim for the wood.  I hit the wood.  Don't turn the door back.  Did you see?  Look at the mark on the wood.  I know you do.  I aim for that, my friend.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Because this guy needs plugs bad.  I don't need plugs.  Fine.  Listen.  Listen.  No.  Rick, you've got to listen.  We need to figure out how to protect the spine.  That is really crucial.  Spine.  Gee, thanks.  Just the spine.  These aren't even going to go in.  They're too blunt. 
[00:37:00]  You got any hammerheads?  Mine, yeah.  Mine's going in.  Yours is going in.  And something to protect the spine.  We'll take a break, and you're going to take darts to the back, right?  Next.  I'll take darts to the back.  All right.  What?  If it hits a rib, he could get quite an infection in the bone.  Who cares?  It's him.  Well, I know.  That is not nice.  Why?  Why?  What have I ever done to you?  Trust me.  I will take great pleasure in this.  Wow.  I could get his pinky.  God damn it, he's tall.  I could hit his pinky from here. 
[00:37:30]  Mitch from Survivor's here.  He's got to be 7'4".  Oh, my God.  He's...  He's...  Wow.  Is he going to throw one at me, too?  We forgot to tell everyone.  Mitch from Survivor.  Yes.  Australian Outback is here.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  He just showed up.  Ah.  And we're throwing darts at you next.  Finally, we've got a show.  Keith, what's up?  Hey, you probably shouldn't go for his back.  It hurts something.  But the place you could go for is throw him right at his ass.  Why not his back?  Well, you got to...  I'm a little worried about the back, too.  Yeah, you got to...  What if we kill him? 
[00:38:00]  That's a good deal.  We paralyze him and he's still rolling in in a wheelchair going,  Hey, no, I don't take it personally, guys.  You know, it's cool.  I still like it.  You need anything?  All right, Keith.  Let's see if he's up for that.  He's up.  All right.  Listen.  I'm going to respirator.  We're going to have to throw him at your ass like a game of ass is up.  I'm not happy about it, and I'm sure you're not.  Yeah, but it's safer that way.  Shoot for cork.  Who's going to shoot for cork?  You're going to have to pull your pants down.  No, no, no, no.  Absolutely not.  You got to...  No.  Like, we're going to enjoy that. 
[00:38:30]  Hold on.  I'm having a hard time just listening to Opie ask Limo Anthony to pull his pants down.  It's got...  No!  No!  The darts will go right through the pants.  They'll go right through my skin.  You're going to be covered up.  Get a grip.  It's either this cloth or none at all.  No.  The back...  If we're doing the back, then you got to take your shirt off.  I know I'm not happy with this, but we're not throwing through a suit.  Why?  No, not a jacket.  What's wrong with the shirt?  No, I'll take the shirt off.  I got a T-shirt. 
[00:39:00]  No, it's got to be the back.  Just bareback?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  No.  No.  No plugs.  No plugs anyway.  You'll never get another plug.  Never get a plug.  It's not like it's armor.  Because now you're backing out.  Everyone was counting on, you know, here, and you get darts to the back.  And now you're, like, you know, fooling around with the rules of the game.  And help me out here.  Come on, Ant.  What, bareback?  Yeah, it has to be bareback.  What's the difference?  You have the record for the most wine bottles in my limo.  You think it'll hurt more?  I don't think it's going to effing matter. 
[00:39:30]  Tell you the truth.  Once it goes through the shirt, which it will, it's the same thing.  It's not like it's armor.  You're going to hurt me.  You just got to throw it harder.  Make sure it goes through.  Because Steve's trying to get video for the website.  It'll just be a...  I don't want that on the website.  Whatever.  No plugs ever.  Ever.  Ever.  We'll even change the codes.  We usually change the codes when we, like, fire someone.  We'll just change them.  So this is it.  Either I walk out and never be with you guys again, or have to get darts thrown on my bareback. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Darts on the bareback.  T-shirt.  This guy's saying that he threw darts at his friend and punctured his kidney.  You've got two.  That rocks.  This is just...  It rocks.  It does rock.  This is just reminiscent of Eddie Haskell and Lumpy.  I swear to God.  Come on, Pete.  Lumpy is Eddie Haskell.  What kind of...  And poor Anthony is Lumpy.  What kind of...  What kind of...  To use the term from yesterday, Anthony, what kind of underpants do you have?  Boxers?  No.  I'm pretty disturbed. 
[00:40:30]  Pains.  See, I don't want to see that either.  I don't want you to see it.  If you had the boxers, it was doable, right?  Garrett?  Right.  Stinky?  Oh, my God.  Trying to call you by your real name.  It's a little weird.  I know.  All right, Anthony.  I'm just saying, whatever he wants to do.  Shirt or no shirt.  I mean...  Shirt's got to be off.  Because we've got to make sure we're not hitting your spine or anything crazy.  Oh, for that reason?  Well, that's good then.  Okay.  Yeah.  So that way we can pick our target.  No, because I want to see him topless.  No, I just thought because you wanted it to hurt more.  But I'm just thinking it'll hurt the same. 
[00:41:00]  Once it goes through the shirt, it's over.  And it'll just be funny to see his stupid hairy back.  And you don't want to ruin your shirt.  Exactly.  There's so many laughs involved with this.  No, I mean...  No, this is just a hairy back.  I ran on you for two and a half years to get me back.  I'm going to enjoy this.  I know you are.  And we're going to do it next.  So get ready.  Do we have the spine protector?  So now we're going just back?  Oh, he's taking the shirt off.  No, don't take the shirt off until we're ready.  What kind of spine protector is that?  Dude, you're giving us a lot of credit. 
[00:41:30]  That thing's like just as thick as his spine.  Wait a minute.  Any deviation either way.  And he's still apt.  You know what?  Five plugs is not enough.  I want unlimited plugs whenever I can.  Like Louis Black.  No.  Come on, I've done a lot.  It's not like you got arrested.  We're just going to throw a dart at you.  You know, come close.  Louis Black was in a jail cell for 28 hours or whatever it was.  You know that.  But you did it.  Almost.  All right.  See, you've got to understand, you don't do this, no plugs ever.  You do this, you get lots of plugs today. 
[00:42:00]  And then you'll be known as the dart guy.  What about plugs in the future?  Possibly.  Always have my mic on at all times?  Annoying laugh, dart guy.  No, we cannot agree to having your mic on at all times.  It has to be a mic on at all times.  Oh, yeah.  Because you always shut it off.  No, you're playing with the rules.  We're on.  All right.  Game on.  Game on.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York. 
[00:42:30]  This show is turning out to be better than yesterday.  Remember what that guy said earlier?  He said we should go home.  Because we're not going to beat yesterday's show, we took on the challenge and it's shaping  up to be a good one today.  Is that your dart throwing music? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  It's good.  I love the crows.  All right, here's the deal.  Wait, I want to say something to you.  I want to say something to you.  We'll get to you in a second.  See what I'm saying, Mitch?  Yeah.  Yeah, I understand that.  Constant attention is needed.  How long would he have lasted on the island?  Oh, man.  Hard to say.  Maybe a day.  No.  If he was the one that fell in the fire, they'd have left him in there.  Thanks, man. 
[00:43:30]  Ouch.  More hated than the hell.  Yeah, really.  Without a doubt.  You could have turned into Lord of the Flies.  You could have heated the whole camp with that blubber.  Sorry, sushi boy.  Whatever.  Imagine him running after the pig instead of Mike to feed everyone on the island.  You could have gone hungry.  Got you.  Oh, man.  All right.  As you can hear, Anthony is sharpening.  Wait a minute.  Sharpening the darts.  Anthony's been sharpening the darts for, I don't know, since we started commercials. 
[00:44:00]  Let me feel it.  Let me feel.  Oh, yeah.  Now, that's a dart.  All right.  Here.  Give him to Stank so he can sterilize him.  These things had been blunted for a while.  Wait.  I'll get to you in a second.  I'm going around the room.  You're last.  Stephen Lynch is in the studio, Anthony.  Need a limo?  Say.  Oh, God.  Wait a minute. 
[00:44:30]  Hey.  I could capitalize on this.  Yeah, if you put a tarp in the back seat so the blood spurting from your orifices doesn't fit all over me.  Oh, here's a, we got some tape of the limo pulling up to pick up Stephen.  Wow, that doesn't sound like a limo, but what the hell?  Maybe it is.  Also, Mike DiNicola in the studio.  We haven't seen him in a while.  Very nice to meet you.  Where have you been, man? 
[00:45:00]  I was on the road.  On the road?  I was doing all the horrible radio spots.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  Green Bay?  Yeah.  Murphy.  Murphy in the morning.  Is that where they just go, you know, they say, hey, Mike DiNicola's in the studio, and then they...  Mike DiNicola.  ...be funny for ten straight minutes, and then they have to cut you off because they have a weather break?  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  It was the really angry guy who's been there for 40 years.  Yeah.  And he's got the two sidekicks that hate him.  Let's go to the weather.  It's going to be cold.  Yeah.  Exactly, yeah. 
[00:45:30]  So what do you think about the pack?  Oh, they look good.  They look good.  Yeah, they sure do.  They sure do.  I've been a cheesehead for years.  But you're being too genial.  They're really angry at each other.  You walk into the studio, and it feels like you're in trouble.  Like, why does everybody hate each other?  Oh, really?  Like, Mommy and Daddy have been fighting?  Yeah.  Because they've been stuck in Green Bay for 40 years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the two sidekicks were young, and they were cool.  But the Murphy guy was just this evil, hateful guy.  That's always the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then he was like, so, why don't you just be funny? 
[00:46:00]  You think you can handle that?  And I'm like, I don't need this at 6.30 in the morning.  So what'd you say?  Yeah, how much do you make?  And what does your wife look like?  Yeah.  I bet.  That's always a good one.  That's a good comment.  That shuts him right up, my Tina Cole one.  We learned that today.  Also in studio, Mitch from Survivor.  Hey.  The seven-foot white guy.  Right.  Right, right.  Great way to describe.  Well, there's an ex-Harlem Globetrotter hopeful. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, we learned that about him so far.  That's a good way to intro him.  Yeah.  Also, annoying wife Anthony from Top Notch Limousies.  Need a town car, Mitch?  I may.  I may.  I'll have to get your card.  Oh, once you got the card.  You're done.  It's a tracking device.  He actually put an electronic tracking device in his cards when he gives them out.  I know where you are.  If you take him up on his offer, just make sure he picks you up about a block or two 
[00:47:00]  from your house.  Okay.  That's so wrong.  Anthony on the phone, what's up?  Hey, Limo Anthony, you douche dyke.  I got a question for you.  Thank you, sir.  You want to have an update?  Your website still says OpenAnthonyFMTalk.  I know, I know.  It's okay.  FMTalk?  You've been there for two years.  I've been working with him for two and a half years.  I don't have time.  That means I'm busy.  Oh, yeah.  What did you make your website on?  MyFirstAOLWebPage.com?  Microsoft.  Hey, that's good.  Hit him in the aisle.  Lead your creatures, baby.  All right, cool.  Look at everything he's got on his website for Top Notch Limo.

You're losing your hair.  You got back hair.  I'm not the driver.  And big sweat stains on your arms.  What are you doing?  Giving out Yankee Crankies in the back of that thing?  I'm not the driver.

Top Notch Limousine is the official transportation company of the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Oh, it is?  Oh, really?  How about that?  It's not.  It's not. 
[00:49:00]  No, it's not.  Okay.  Are these retro-active plugs right here?  Coming soon.  Top Notch Calendar Girls and Top Notch Sports Picks for your entertainment pleasure.

We have tires.  Bill, what's up?  What's going on now?  It's just like, oh my God.  Bill.  Thanks.  Bill.  Yeah.

No.  Well, Hot Shows link is on there.  It's supposed to be gone.  By the way, Stephen Lynch will be gone.  We'll be playing some new songs for us on the show today after we get done with you.  Done with me?  Are we ready?  Where's the darts?  Where's Stinky?  Stinky. 
[00:50:30]  Who's got the poison tip darts?  Well, that's a good question.  This is sick, man.  You're begging me to turn his mind on.  Isn't this wrong?  I love it.  You're begging me to turn his mind on.  No, I didn't.  I said get off the site.  That's what I said.  You're my time.  That's what I was begging.  No, it's not.  Get off the site.  Let me tell you, you can't even get to Top Notch Limousine right now.  TopNotchLimo.com.  It's getting pounded.  It's getting pounded.  Hey, Stink.  Grab his mic for a minute.  What do we do to sterilize this?  You threw a pen at me, Anthony.  Good job.  I got two effing darts.  I'm going to hurl at your back. 
[00:51:00]  The pen really hurt.  Ooh.  Go.  We burned him with a Bic lighter and then rubbed him down with alcohol.  Steril.  Steril.  Wow.  All right.  Okay.  I think we're ready.  Yes.  I imagine everyone understands what's going on here.  Annoying Laugh Anthony will be removing that sweat-stained shirt of his.  He'll be facing a wall, and we're throwing darts at his body.  You are just a cruel human being.  I know, and I love it. 
[00:51:30]  You are just the worst.  You just gave me a great compliment.  Thank you.  I know that.  You know it, too, and you love to see other people.  All right.  So Randy's telling me to double in, double out, but I think I'm just going to shoot for cork.  Shoot for cork.  Hit me with your best shot.  All right.  Listen.  So here's the deal.  For every dart that hits you in the back.  How many darts are we allowed to throw at you?  Four.  Just four?  That's it?  Yes.  You sure?  Yes.  Okay.  For every dart that hits your back, you get a plug.  No.  No.  No.  And anything that sticks, I get ten plugs. 
[00:52:00]  Sticks?  No, five.  You can't change the rules now.  I heard fire talking hair now, right?  I heard fire talking hair.  What are you doing?  Go home.  I heard.  Out.  All right.  Turn the stinky cam around.  Where's Anthony going to stand?  He's going to stand away.  So I want our listeners to be able to see this.  Stand against the wall.  Where are you going to be standing, Anthony?  Are we micing him?  Turn your...  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I think it's time to get up.  All right.  Well, let him stand there.  And then, Rick, adjust the camera quickly so I can take a look and make sure it's okay.  I'm good.  I used to be on a league, man. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  Of course, I was after like 12 beers before the first game started.  I don't know how I play sober.  All right.  Take your shirt off.  No.  Stand just like this.  No.  No, we've got to make sure we don't hit the spine.  That's the only reason.  Look at this.  God, look at this.  This is nasty.  Look at this.  Make sure you mic him because the noise, that's going to come out of him.  These are really sharp now.  I love it.  All right.  Are we ready?  Who's going to...  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:53:00]  Me and you got to get odds or evens for who takes the first shot.  One, two, five, two.  You bastards.  All right.  Hank goes first.  You're going to throw from there?  Yeah.  This is like a pretty legit distance.  All right.  Get out of here.  Crap.  We should give the visual.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let's give the visual here.  The tool is against the wall.  The tool?  You know, I would avoid turning around like that all the time.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:53:30]  He keeps winging his head around.  Hey, to make sure you don't...  Hey, did I mention...  My eye!  Okay, his spine is covered.  Lynch, you're funny.  But is it really covered?  Well, I don't know.  I'm seeing like a little out of that left side.  I could probably take out his foot.  Yeah, there is.  I think I see the nerve that goes to his foot.  Anthony, vertebraes 7 and 12 are exposed.  Yeah.  I know.  Okay, Anthony gets...  Stop moving. 
[00:54:00]  Turn around, nasty back.  Okay, and I'm going to get a double lumbar for out.  No, don't bend down.  That's good.  Maybe we can arc it in.  Anthony, move closer.  No, this is how far a regulation dartboard is.  All right, go ahead.  And...  Remember, if it doesn't hit your back, you don't get the plug.  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Is he bleeding?  Oh, there's a hole in his t-shirt. 
[00:54:30]  Come on, man!  That was a great shot, man.  Oh, yeah.  I put that right in the shoulder blade.  All right, wait.  Right in the effing shoulder blade.  All right, three to go.  This should be good.  Opie's pitching.  Opie!  Wait, he gets a plug for that.  I forgot where I work the pain.  Vital transportation.  1-800-GO-VITAL.  God, you are a puss, right?  You're taking the mic.  All right, Opie.  Opie's pitching from the Little League mound, so this one's going to hurt a lot more.  Yeah, Opie's really close. 
[00:55:00]  No, because I know what he's going to say.  No, don't turn around like that, Anthony.  You've got to put an eye out.  Don't stop.  I'm very injured.  Oh, move your head.  Rick's pretty close, too.  Opie!  Wait, I want to go for...  No!  Don't, don't.  All right, that's a tough shot, O.  It's a little low.  You suck.  Oh, he nailed him in the love handle.  Man, you nailed him right in the love handle, man. 
[00:55:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  This is the most fun you can ever have.  You see that guard bounce off that love handle?  I get a plug, right?  Yeah, you get a plug.  It didn't even stick in.  Top-notch limontines.  516-756-1663.  Oh, look at you.  Radio voice.  Shut up.  Make it stick.  Make it stick.  Come on.  $10 if it sticks. 
[00:56:00]  No!  No!  Firehook.  Come on, Ant.  It's caught.  It's caught.  It's just caught.  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're fine.  Ask the room officially for that one.  No.  No.  No.  It caught, but it didn't stick.  We have blood.  We have blood.  We've got blood.  You've got one more.  You've got one more.  You've got blood.  You've got blood.  Hey, wait, wait. 
[00:56:30]  You get five plugs.  Oh, good.  What do you want to do?  You want to do them all in a box?  Do you want to spread them out?  He's bleeding.  I'm bleeding.  I've got to take this shirt tonight.  Come on.  Yeah, there's a little.  Oh, my God.  He's bleeding.  All right.  You can take a break.  You need to take a breather?  It's no worse than a tattoo.  Oh, my God.  Put a little tissue on.  Did you see it hang there for a couple of seconds before it fell asleep?  Briefly, it caught.  All right. 
[00:57:00]  He's worried about his T-shirt.  He has a little blood in it.  So get him in the same spot.  He needs a shirt tonight.  It's already wrecked there.  What should I do, Sensei?  All right.  Leave my fat rolls alone.  How's the anticipation, Ann?  Not knowing when it's actually coming.  It's the worst in the world, I'm telling you right now.  Isn't that terrible?  Opie.  No.  Come on, Opie.  That's some really skillful shots here.  Opie, you can get...  Don't look.  Do not look.  Come on.  Just wait.  Come on.  No.  Shut up.  Listen, Rick, shut up. 
[00:57:30]  You'd make a great terrorist, Rick.  Shut up.  You better talk.  Shut up.  You don't know when it's coming.  Three, two, one.  It's like when you go to throw the stick for the dog and he goes to chase it, even though  you didn't throw it.  I didn't throw it yet.  I have a...  On what?  Go.  Can I get a request?  Yeah.  Can I get a regular character for this show?  What a tool.  What a tool. 
[00:58:00]  Definitely on three this time, all right?  Count it down.  Count it down.  Three, two, one.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  No!  No!  Oh, man!  You winged that!  No way!  Did he get the same spot?  He drew blood.  I didn't draw blood and it didn't stick.  I didn't wing it.  I thought he was in the same spot.  Wait, wait, hold on.  Hold on.  Come here!  Come here!  Hold on!  You can slide all those mics over now. 
[00:58:30]  Holy Jesus.  What happened?  Where'd he go?  Hold on.  Get him back in here.  What did he get all mad at?  Get back in here.  All right, he's coming back in, Ann.  You drew blood.  I drew blood and he threw it really hard and it was two of them.  You threw it at the same time.  I didn't throw.  Anthony, I swear to you, I did not throw another dart.  I threw two darts.  Who threw the other dart?  I don't know.  Someone else in the room.  Mitch.  It wasn't me.  Mitch.  He's blaming Mitch from Survivor Window. 
[00:59:00]  No, I wanted to throw one.  I didn't get to.  Let me see.  Pull the shirt down so we can see the...  No, I'm serious.  Let me see.  It's a hole.  Let's see the actual wound.  Yeah, we've got to see the actual wound.  I don't want to take my back.  Well, just pull the shirt up or something.  Let the prisoner go, Rick.  He is sweating.  There's beads of sweat.  You're free!  You're free!  You're free!  You're trying sitting there while I was doing darts.  Two years with hatred on me.  All right, so how many plugs?  How many plugs?  I get ten plugs, and I'll pick and choose when I want to use them.  Wait, there was not ten. 
[00:59:30]  Ten?  There's no way.  Five for Anthony's stick in one.  How many plugs have you done already?  Two.  Two, so five plus the one I did, six.  And we'll give you an extra one for that other person that threw it at your butt.  So seven plugs.  Okay.  There you go.  Well done.  For one, I'm very impressed.  We will play those plugs on the Sunday night show.  Let's look at the back.  Wait, we've got to see the back.  Hold on.  Yeah, let's see a good shot of that back.  No, turn around.  Turn around. 
[01:00:00]  I've got to see it.  I've got to see it.  Not done.  How did it get through that?  Wait, let me see.  Let me see.  It's a make-down.  Oh, my God.  That was a nice one.  And then Rick rips more hair out of his back with some duct tape.  Insult to injury.  The one I threw up?  Yeah.  Did you see the way it hung?  Yeah.  For a little bit and kind of went, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then fell out?  Did you see the mark?  Yeah.  That was a good one.  Look at how happy you are.  Did you see the mark?  It left a good one. 
[01:00:30]  He's got two of them.  I will think about this for the next two months, but I'm feeling down.  I'm just going to start laughing like a little school girl.  Isn't that great?  Something to just perk you up.  Yeah.  Start a lead.  Bravo, Anthony.  So, Mitch, Survivor, who's...  No.  We got Mitch from Survivor.  We got Stephen Lynch.  Adelphi University.  Go Panthers.  Basketball.  There's one of my plugs.  Six left.  You're using that as one of your... 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, it's my alma mater.  Oh, my God.  My alma mater.  First off.  Hi.  I just have to say something.  Yeah.  When I first started listening to the ONA show, I said, oh, you know, maybe they're a little  too sexist, but now I have to say, all men and women on the Opie and Anthony show are  created equal.  No, no, I think I got a tweet with that.  I think the guys are treated worse than the girls lately.  Without a doubt.  Anthony, now, it's a good thing you didn't ruin that shirt.  Well, it might.  Where'd you get that?  This I got at, um...  I don't know.  Where?  Joseph Abood.  Oh.  Five left. 
[01:01:30]  TJ, what's up?  This should be the only way people get plugged out now.  You got to get well with thoughts.  I agree.  That was kind of sick.  I agree.  All right, guys.  You got to see the blood on his T-shirt.  It sounded pretty painful out here.  You might want to, yeah, plug up the hole or something.  Yeah, put something over that.  Hey, Uncle John wants to know something.  Uncle John.  Yeah, I saw that.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hey, little Anthony. 
[01:02:00]  I just got a question.  Hi, Uncle John.  How are you?  Shut up.  Pretty good, thanks.  One quick question for you.  If I offer you a dozen plugs, will you take a lethal injection?  I'll do it.  All right, bro.  See you, guys.  Thank you.  Let's go to Brendan.  Brendan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You know, in Full Metal Jacket, when they start whipping private piles,  with the bars of soap?  Yep.  Limo Anthony, you know that these guys are not your friends, right?  I'm realizing that more and more by the day. 
[01:02:30]  You know, it's funny.  They'll call me when they need something, but when I walk in here, they hate my guts.  You're going to be tonight laying in bed, and you're going to start to cry.  Without a doubt.  I'm crying already.  You make me sad, bro.  You got to say that.  I make myself sad sometimes.  Oh, God.  That's good.  Take care.  All right.  Ant's been good, though.  You want anything?  You okay?  Yeah, I'm all right, Ant.  Thanks for taking.  Now you'll finally talk to me after two years.  No, I just want to know, because you're very entertaining.  I want to know if you need anything to cover up your cut with that you got on your back,  or anything to eat. 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Something to drink.  I'm all back to you.  Yeah?  What are you getting at?  I'm just trying to be nice to him.  Okay.  That's all.  You want a beer?  Yeah, I do want a beer.  What beer has we got?  What do you want, Ant?  I want a Budwell.  No, no.  One left.  I didn't say it.  I didn't say it.  You said Bud.  No, man.  People all know what a Bud means.  The best part was just listening to you roping it in, knowing exactly what was going to happen.  Dude, it's a deal with the devil.  Greg, you never get the wishes that are entitled to that you're entitled to. 
[01:03:30]  We're co-Satans.  Greg.  Hey, Greg?  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh, man.  What's the matter with that guy?  I don't know.  That guy is dumber than a bag of hammers.  Oh, Anthony, man.  You got to get your head examined.  Anthony's dart did stick to the back of knowing laugh, Anthony.  I laid that in.  You know what that shot was?  When I'm trying to double out and I'm shooting the bottom of the board, I need a six, and  I was shooting for the three, so you try to lob it in. 
[01:04:00]  That was it.  And it was a perfect, like, it had enough arc to it that it stuck in at a little bit  of an angle and then ripped some flesh out as it tips back down.  I was very happy with that shot.  I was smiling when you were doing it.  I certainly was, but not as hard as I hope you was.  You really enjoyed it.  I love that stuff.  Especially with me.  God, I love that.  All right, good job.  Yeah, bravo.  All the plugs to other times, right?  Anytime you're on. 
[01:04:30]  You can plug.  Right.  You've got four plugs left and you use them wisely.  You didn't read the contract.  There's a time limit, you know.  Thanks.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  So lots to go.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, where's Gary Moore? 
[01:05:00]  I'm going after it.  I've got a crazy train.  Hey, where's Gary Moore?  Yeah, where is he?  Gary.  Gary Moore.  What's up?  What's up, Gary?  What's up, Gary?  How are you?  Make yourself at home or just having a little party here? 
[01:05:30]  Swept away.  Oh, my only girl.  Isn't that a sad story?  Three girls swept away here in New York in a riptide.  Horrible.  Tell you a little story.  Wrote a song about it.  Here it goes.  Yeah, I just do a song.  I song about it.  Stealing from me in living color.  It's a shame about these three girls.  May God bless them.  Yeah, you know. 
[01:06:00]  But I'm keeping my breasts.  Okay, y'all?  Oh, you don't want to get the...  Those guys out there talking about you guys going to do some...  Yeah, we got the man boobs contest.  I'm too young to have my boobs cut.  No?  I'm too young to have them cut.  Well, you look like you keep yourself in shape.  So, I don't think you need that.  My wife goes crazy over these every night.  Oh, yeah?  She loves my body.  She's crazy.  I mean, really.  She's an animal.  That's what you need.  I take off my shirt.  Can't get rid of it, man.  And she's like...  She just made a search for birthday.  I hope she isn't listening, you know. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know.  Well, those guys have man boobs, Gary.  Yeah.  So, they need some of the fat sucked out.  They are men.  What other boobs could they have?  Well, you want to see them?  See how bad they can't women boobs?  They're men, right?  Right.  So, why is he telling me, since I started with men, that they got man boobs?  Did I think they had bear boobs or something like that?  No, but, you know, they call them man boobs.  Or chicken boobs.  If you just say boobs, you default to woman.  You know what I mean?  So, if you say man boobs, you know it's a guy with boobs.  Well, since we talk about man boobs, can we bring a woman in here to show us her boobs? 
[01:07:00]  I don't know what they look like.  Can we have a girl, Sandy?  Yeah, because I don't remember what they look like.  Sure.  Why don't we bring in?  Do you remember what women?  I don't, you know, I saw the, well, my memory revived.  Gary.  All right.  Sandy came.  Yeah.  Benaka.  Benaka.  This is me.  This is about to make you wish you were back at the ATM.  Yeah.  Oh, Jay.  Oh.  I'm a guest, man.  I'm a guest.  Hi, baby.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  Hello, beautiful.  That's what everyone says.  Oh, my God.  Hello, beautiful.  Hello, beautiful.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Garrett's always a gentleman. 
[01:07:30]  He always kisses a lady's hand.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no.  Ixnay on auto twang.  Go get the Lysol.  Go get the chemical.  What?  Get the DDT.  Don't you, but just remember that.  Watch out, man.  Okay?  Just remember that I told you last night, okay?  Yeah.  Garrett.  Now, Garrett, on a short notice.  The same hand that Sandy Cain used to make sure the hemorrhoid was visible.  Let's just put it that way.  Now, Garrett, we apologize. 
[01:08:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, see, words like hemorrhoids.  You know, I think those are like, you know.  What, hemorrhoids?  Yeah, that's below the belt.  Well, she's got them.  But she's got them.  Garrett, you want to see below the belt?  I don't want to.  Show much you guys, Sandy.  I don't want to hear about no hemorrhoids.  Huh?  Sandy.  Oh, she's in on it, too?  Sandy, Sandy.  But I'm saying, show them Twato.  No, I don't want.  I don't want.  It's that bad.  Twato.  You don't want to see Twato, Garrett?  It's all on one.  It looks like pasta. 
[01:08:30]  Lurch.  Lurch.  Are you in the car?  Please drive here, please.  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Hey, wait.  No, just show Garrett really fast.  But back up.  But back way up.  I already saw it.  Oh, you didn't see this.  I saw it.  I saw the hemorrhoid.  No, this is something a little different, my friend.  Sandy Kane, back way up to the CD rack.  All right.  There you go.  Just give Garrett some room there.  All right.  Okay.  She looks great.  She looks great.  All right.  Sandy, hurry up.  Let's go.  If she kept walking backwards.  You look good, too. 
[01:09:00]  There you go.  A little compliment.  I'm not looking at no hemorrhoid.  No, it's not a hemorrhoid.  It's Twato.  It's Twato.  Check this out.  Twato is an amazing conjoined twin she has growing out of her lap.  Yeah.  Watch this.  Check that out.  Ready?  Yeah.  There you go.  Oh.  What the hell is that, Garrett?  What is that?  We're selling advertising space on you.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have an alien that has been living here.  Doesn't that have been a living?  I have discovered the alien.  You ever see Total Recall with Twato?  You can cover it up now.  Right?  Okay.  I'll remember this for the rest of my life. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  No way.  You have to show me.  I got it in here.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because that's something that doesn't leave you very quickly.  So you were serious when you were talking.  Oh, yeah.  She got like a thing going on.  The other thing is in the back.  No, there's one just like it.  No, no, no, no.  There's one just like it at the back door.  I don't care.  All right.  Garrett doesn't want to see it.  Send me a picture.  Okay.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen, I thought I was going to come in here and talk about a movie called  Jackpot.  Oh, no.  I didn't know about it. 
[01:10:00]  I didn't know about it.  There's the plug.  I was wondering.  I didn't know I was going to tell you to talk about hemorrhoidal situations and preparation  age situations and wear situations and little things crawling out just situations.  I didn't know.  I thought I was going to come in here.  Jackpot.  Right.  Hello.  You know, Jackpot, which is not talking about Las Vegas.  Yeah.  What's Jackpot all about, Gary Moore?  Well, Jack, Jackpot.  Why don't you should ask?  I was wondering. 
[01:10:30]  It is a movie.  Okay.  Now, what's your name again?  Sandy Kane.  It doesn't have Sandy in it, although I think we would rethink that had we seen her before.  Because it is a weird kind of a movie.  And I think Sandy sort of belongs in a movie we call weird.  Would you say?  Do you have the part of the cabber available?  Huh?  But Jackpot is about the movie that I just made with this guy, Jonathan Grice.  Uh-huh.  He used to be my engineer in Martin.  I did a thing called Martin a long time ago. 
[01:11:00]  Sure.  You probably don't remember that.  My hand.  It's a black show.  You guys probably don't look at it.  I love watching Martin.  On WB.  You probably just look at ABC and NBC TV.  My hand.  What's up?  Okay.  Of course.  What's up?  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, you dig it.  And then a guy came five years later and claims he created what's up, what's up, what's up,  what's up, what's up, what's up.  Who said that?  What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up, what's up.  So I said, what's that?  He said, well, it just developed.  I said, what happened to Martin?  Oh, like the Budweiser guys, you mean?  Yeah, he said, what's up?  What's up?  He didn't discover that. 
[01:11:30]  Are you saying Martin invented what's up?  Hello?  What's up?  Yes.  Boris is saying that.  No one said what's up before Martin?  It wasn't in the English language.  Everyone's ripping off Martin.  It wasn't in the English language.  It wasn't in the English language.  But Jackpot, Jackpot, Jackpot.  Get that back to Jackpot.  Ladies and gentlemen, come Friday, Jackpot, we're going to jump out of the pot.  Jackpot.  Yes, we're going to have a premiere.  You're right, Mr. Morris, that commercial stole from Martin.  And, and, and, and. 
[01:12:00]  And?  Your favorite, Daryl Hannah's going to be in it.  I don't like Daryl Hannah.  Okay, your favorite.  Oh, yeah.  Your favorite, Peg Lipton.  No, I'm cheating.  Peg Lipton.  Hello, you all right?  Is she all right with you?  From the Mod Squad.  She was banging Quincy Jones.  Yeah, she certainly was.  Well, I'm not in the woman's sex life.  I'm just talking about in the movie.  Yeah.  Who else is in it, Mr. Morris?  Uh, well, yours truly, Jonathan Daryl Hannah.  Crystal Bernard.  Now, Crystal is all right, right?  I mean, Crystal is a...  I wonder if Quincy Jones' glasses got all messed up when he was banging Peggy Lipton like they were in the We of the World video. 
[01:12:30]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, this is called trying to fire the gates.  Odds that are not just, you know, unconquerable.  I understand.  But just trying to just get up out of a pile of shit.  I'm sorry.  You know what I mean?  Get your head up.  Did you believe that?  You're going to believe that?  Yeah, we could get that.  Get your head up out of this pile of animal manure. 
[01:13:00]  Manure, all right?  I understand.  Animal manure, all right?  And get your head up just to say, jackpot.  Jackpot.  Jackpot, yes.  It premieres Friday.  It premieres Friday, yes.  So, anyway, anyway, anyway, come in, come in, come in, lady, come in, lady.  Now, now, now, you see, he shows, he shows, he shows that he ain't right.  Why didn't he say, uh, I'm a joy, Joe.  Mr. Morris, I didn't do that.  Yeah, he said it's Bill Cobby. 
[01:13:30]  Black.  He'd be better off rolling Magic Johnson through barbed wire and then hugging him.  Another black guy or something.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, you've got to explain what's going on.  That's a great line.  Let's start.  He's humming Sandy.  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  Go ahead.  I can't even hear what's going on.  All right.  Well, Gary Morris is, uh, hugging Sandy Kane.  And Jim said, he means, amazing grace.  Jim said.  Ask me, does I pray for him, Lord, pray for him. 
[01:14:00]  That's me.  I'll wait until the music stops.  Oh, red like them.  Say, pray for him, Lord, pray for them.  They once were rubbish at home.  But now they've been found.  And they were lost.  But now they're at sea.  No, no.  Thank you, Lord.  Play a song like Decaptown Lady. 
[01:14:30]  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.  What the hell was that?  I think Chico Escuela took one too many balls to the head.  I'm a Miss Plebeian, ladies and gentlemen.  I'm a Miss Plebeian, you know.  I pay you boys to build a railroad, not jump around like a bunch of Kansas City faggots.  I'm a Miss Philistines, ladies and gentlemen.  But I want you to know that I have not sinned.  No.  I have not sinned.  Tell her, brother.  Okay?  I came here in good faith, Lord have mercy. 
[01:15:00]  Gary, I got to ask you something.  And my good name has been drilled through the blood.  I'm sorry, Jim Norton.  You know?  And you have drugged my name to the mud.  Hey, if we can't have Dice on the show, what the hell?  Gary Morris will do.  Andrew Dice?  Yes.  Oh, that's my mantra.  Andrew Dice.  Andrew Dice.  Hey, how you doing?  Go ahead, man.  Hey, how you doing?  Talk, bro.  Talk, bro.  Hey, this is a man's show.  How come I get banned from this show?  This is a man's show.  This is a man's show.  Go talk, bro. 
[01:15:30]  Talk, bro.  How come I get banned from Saturday Night Live?  I don't know.  I've been banned my damn self, so what the f*** can't pass you, man?  You ever seen me on in the last 20 years or so?  Hey, Gary, what is that like when you get shot?  That's got to hurt, right?  In other words, nothing is sacred.  No, no.  I got to know.  No, I don't ask that question, Mr. Morris.  Stop asking.  What happened in that situation?  Because you heard about it, but I never heard any details afterwards. 
[01:16:00]  Well, know why you never heard the details?  Why?  Because I don't f***ing don't want to tell you the details.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Good.  All right.  You don't ever want to tell me the details.  Well, you know what I mean?  All right.  I have spinal cord injury, bro.  The thing went through my spine.  I'm supposed to be a quadriplegic.  And you're walking.  Now, watch it.  Now, laugh.  I ain't laughing.  Yeah, you are.  Yeah, you are.  Why would I laugh?  Yeah, you're laughing.  Yeah, you want to laugh at something like that?  You want to laugh?  Gary, why would I laugh at something like that?  Because you're a student of sick comedy, and you guys laugh at anything. 
[01:16:30]  And there's nothing else sacred here.  That's right.  Yeah.  You guys don't.  Hey, there you go.  You guys don't hold anything.  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  I'll say Jesus Christ.  See?  I think we got off on the bad on a wrong question.  Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother, mother.  What's the name of the lady who just died?  Mother Teresa.  Mother Teresa.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just died.  He laughed.  He laughed.  He laughed.  He laughed.  That was funny.  Okay.  I'm glad.  Okay.  I got no conscience.  Martha Washington. 
[01:17:00]  See, that's not funny.  You're a legend in the comedy.  No, I'm, I'm, I'm, no, no, no, no, no.  And you were injured, so we wanted to ask it.  No, you're setting me up for nothing, okay?  I am the least one in this line, okay?  I ain't no legend in my own line.  I ain't nothing but just a common American black boy trying to make a living in this man's  world.  You know what I mean?  Garrett, seriously.  And y'all just thinking all black people.  That's all you do.  No, Garrett.  I was talking to you outside. 
[01:17:30]  I told you you were in my prayers.  Like, that really was, like, big news and shook a lot of people up.  And I really, honestly, I know these guys real well.  You told me I was your parent.  What?  You said?  I was your parent.  You said I was your what?  I said you were in my prayers when I found out you got shot.  Hey, man.  And so I'm telling you.  You sure did.  I know this.  He prayed the same.  And then you, I know these two guys well enough that if he's asking you about what  happened, it's because he's concerned also.  I really wanted to know because I never got any knowledge on it.  And I just told him. 
[01:18:00]  I just told him.  And if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.  Did you know the guys?  Were they, like, gangbangers?  Was it, like, just a random thing?  Did I know the guys were shabby?  Hell no.  Jim, shut up and stop pretending you're a kiss-ass.  These guys, this was a guy and a girl.  You're like Norris sitting here.  This was a guy and a girl.  Oh, here it comes.  Phone call.  Phone call pending.  No, I didn't know these two.  But I've been going around South Central for, like, 12, 13 years before that happened.  Is that where you're from?  No, no.  I'm from New Orleans, Louisiana.  But I happen to be living in L.A. 
[01:18:30]  But why does a man with a lot of money, like, live in South Central Los Angeles?  That's a good question.  Do you go to U.S.T. or something?  I don't understand the question.  I can live where I want to do anything to you.  Wow.  And my money need not be something you ask if I have a relationship to that.  Oh, yes.  No, no.  That's your problem, not mine.  That's your problem, not mine, bro.  I don't have any problems.  It's not a question I would ask is what I'm saying.  You know, but I don't live in South Central.  I live in Burbank.  Okay.  But I would live in South Central if I wanted to.  It had no problem to do with...  Hey, man, I'm on your side.  I'm just saying...  And I'm not on your side. 
[01:19:00]  I'm on your side.  I'm answering you correctly, bro.  Thank you, sir.  And that is that where I live has to do with only how I feel inside and not the amount of money I have.  I'm not questioning...  I know you're not.  You're being sensitive.  I'm simply answering all the ramifications of your questions.  You are being very pure.  I applaud you.  Hey, everything's cool.  I'm not putting you down.  But I still repeat, I'll live wherever the s*** I want.  Okay?  And it has no relationship to my money or whatever money I might have.  You're going to be bleeping out all of this, right? 
[01:19:30]  It has no relationship to the money.  And the reason why I answered that is because your boy was living there, Ice Cube.  Why are you so sensitive about it, though, Garrett?  Ice Cube.  Why are you so sensitive?  Who's sensitive?  Because I said I live wherever the s*** I want?  No, not that one.  You're saying that's sensitive.  That's just Garrett.  No, that was him.  No, I didn't say nothing.  I'm blaming you.  No, that's him.  All you white guys sound alike to me.  Okay?  We all sound alike.  Garrett, I think the prevailing question, to be more blunt with my point is,  like, I act like you, and I, like, I'm not really going to go to an ATM in South Central 
[01:20:00]  because it's probably not the safest place to go to an ATM.  That's not right.  That's not, you're thinking wrong.  Everywhere you go is that you get shot, excuse me, any f***ing way you go in Los Angeles,  you get shot.  Okay?  Okay?  So, to say, look, there's a high crime rate in Hollywood.  Right now, Hollywood.  It doesn't match South Central, but it's high.  All right?  And Van Nuys has a high crime rate.  All right?  You know why?  Mexicans.  Oh. 
[01:20:30]  Not the black people.  Not the black people.  Not the black people.  Not the black people.  Not the Mexicans.  I don't want to speak against my people, my friends.  You're strong.  Garrett Morris is strong.  Is this a setup?  No.  No, it ain't a setup.  Look, I want to thank you guys.  I'm serious, okay?  I really want to thank you guys for having me here, okay?  No problem. 
[01:21:00]  All right.  No, hey, you know, not everybody's doing it.  Conan said no.  Really?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  That son of a bitch.  Huh?  What are you working on?  I guess he knows how it is.  Well, fancy you should ask.  Besides Jackpot, I got a sitcom I'm working on that's called Bourbon Street, a jazz sitcom.  I'm from New Orleans, and I'm trying to hook up something that's out of New Orleans.  Let's all sing one of the songs I think can bring everyone together that Garrett made famous  back on SNL.  I'm going to get me a shotgun to kill all the whities I see. 
[01:21:30]  I'm going to get me a shotgun to kill all the whities I see.  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to know I love white people, okay?  They're all right with me.  Of course.  Okay?  White people all right with me.  I did happen to write that song, that's true.  It's a legendary bitch. 
[01:22:00]  But I have nothing against white people, particularly white ladies.  Please don't get turned off by the song, okay?  All right.  All right.  Hey, Garrett, we're going to say thank you.  And good luck with Jackpot.  The Jackpot?  Thank you, man.  The great Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris, everyone.  The great Garrett Morris!  There he goes.  Garrett Morris.  Feel the love.  Feel the love.  Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris, everyone. 
[01:22:30]  Garrett Morris!  Keep clapping until he leaves.  Garrett Morris, thank you.  The great Garrett Morris!  Garrett Morris, everyone.  Garrett Morris!  Keep clapping until he leaves.  Garrett Morris!  Garrett Morris, everybody.  We love Garrett Morris.  There he goes.  Jay Moore getting some love from Garrett Morris.  Garrett Morris!  Garrett Morris!  Okay.  All right.  The great Garrett Morris.  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:23:00]  Stay there.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, New York.  I know the pieces in desire.  Watch the tumble down.  No fault.  Now you're too plain.  It doesn't mean I don't desire.  To point the finger.  Blame the other. 
[01:23:30]  Watch the tumble.  Top of the world.  Bring the pieces back together.  We discover communication.  Dre from the city.  Did you guys watch the NRA meeting last weekend?  Charlton Heston spoke and it was like a scene from Planet of the Apes.  He was holding a big rifle and yelling.  What do you know something?  I've never seen.  You know something?  I am a very strong advocate to the right to bear arms. 
[01:24:00]  I really am.  I'm serious.  But that Charlton Heston is an effing lunatic.  He's out of his mind.  That guy is crazy.  Looking more and more like an ape every day.  Oh, yeah.  He's starting to look exactly like Dr. Zayas.  He's getting the big protruding jaw.  Dr. Zayas, help me.  Zira, Cornelius, help me.  Yeah.  We got him. 
[01:24:30]  He looks just like him.  Damn you.  He did that famous line.  They get up my gun when they pry my cold dead fingers from around us.  Damn you all to hell.  And he had the rifle up in the air.  He was holding it like Moses helped the staff.  Yeah.  And he's like holding it.  Damn you.  I was expecting him to fire a few rounds off into the scene.  Damn you all to hell.  Yeah.  You're anti-gun people. 
[01:25:00]  F off.  I treat you like I treated those gorillas on Planet of the Apes with my gun.  Remember that?  I shot them all, bastards.  Then I fooled Dr. Zayas to come around the corner.  And I put the gun to his head.  That red monkey ass is.  I believe it is the right of every American to have a Vulcan cannon in his car if he wants  one.  Damn you. 
[01:25:30]  And what's the problem?  Why?  Why a problem with the theme restaurant in Times Square?  We want an NRA theme restaurant along with Planet Hollywood and the Hard Rock and the Sports  Cafe.  Mr. Heston, that's a little wacky.  Why damn you?  NRA theme restaurant in Times Square.  Why?  What's the difference?  It's a hobby.  A sport like everyone else. 
[01:26:00]  Why can you have goddamn hippie communist clothes hanging up in the Hard Rock?  But you can't have good old American guns in a restaurant.  That's what a restaurant needs.  Come on.  We could serve the children little, like, sundaes after they eat.  Ice cream sundaes with, like, Magnum Rounds decorating it.  That'd be cute.  You'd take them home.  Little guns hanging up all over the place.  They're out of their mind, though, in our theme restaurant. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, because we were at the All-Star Cafe, and we ordered the Shack Attack turkey sandwich.  Shack Attack turkey sandwich.  Whatever it was.  Why have that when you can have ruby ridge ribs?  Come on, damn you.  How about the Columbine cobbler salad?  Yes.  It's on the menu.  Or if you're watching the game.  Yeah.  What would be better than sitting down with some wacky Waco wings?  Hot wings.  Come on, damn you. 
[01:27:00]  Mr. Heston, don't forget about the Luwima lasagna.  Yes.  That'd be great.  All the waitstaff will have guns.  So if anyone tries to walk out on the check, we shoot them.  Can you imagine that?  The Kent State College crunchy chicken fingers.  There's just a few things on the menu.  Damn you.  I'll treat you like that red ass, mandrel monkey ass, gorilla ass that was trying to get me on Planet of the Apes. 
[01:27:30]  Can I say ass one more time?  I'll be the hostess.  I'll be the hostess.  Yeah?  Fully armed.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  When you order a steak, you go in the back and shoot it yourself.  Come on. 
[01:28:00]  I'll give you a 30-odd six and you'll just pluck it off.  Pass that dumb cow over the head.  We'll hold his feet.  We'll head him and heel him with the rope.  You take out the 357 right between the horns.  And then, oh, it's so tender and juicy that way.  Would you like it?  Well done or rare so it's red like Zira's monkey ass. 
[01:28:30]  Some days I'll be dressed in a loincloth.  Oh, yuck.  Some days in a loincloth.  Some days in my outfit I had in the Omega Man.  Right.  Remember that movie?  Sure do.  What did I have in the Omega Man?  Guns and plenty of them to shoot the dead.  What happens if we're overrun with the living dead and we don't have guns to defend ourselves?  What happens if we don't have guns in this country and all of a sudden gorillas take over?  Would you like to be like those mindless people held in cages? 
[01:29:00]  Being dissected?  Or would you like to be like Chuck Heston when I see the Statue of Liberty and I fight back with my gun?  Damn you!  You blew it up!  Remember, every Chuck Heston movie you see where I have a gun, I come out on top.  Although I died in Planet of the Apes.  I died in the Omega Man.  I died in Soylent Green. 
[01:29:30]  Wait a minute.  Hold it.  That didn't work out too well.  I didn't have a gun in Ten Commandments and I lived.  I didn't have a gun in Ben Hearn.  I made it through that.

The Lee Harvey omelet. 
[01:30:30]  Lee Harvey omelet.  For breakfast.  Look at the way we break the eggs.  Back and to the left.  Back and to the left.  And then a little, a little, a little, a little, what's her name, Kennedy?  Jackie O.  Jackie O.  Tries to get the shell from the back of the trunk of the car and put it back on the egg.  It's so cute.  Boy, I went a long way for that dopey joke.  Blood-stained tablecloths on every table.  Moses from Egypt checking in.

How about the John Wilkes Booth bacon cheeseburger?  That's a good one.  All right.  A big stack of curly fries.  It'll be good food.  Good food and firearms.  That's what we need in Times Square.

Beneath the Planet of the Apes.  Yeah.  I shot them all!  Yes, you did.  Guns!  We need more guns in our restaurant. 
[01:33:30]  Damn you!  We're gonna have a special lunch.  Uh, special for postal employees.  Yeah?  They come in.  Yeah, they bring their own guns.  Blow off some steam and some heads.  Bring in a gun, get a free, uh, appetizer?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, man.  The David Koresh Kanish.  For our Hebrew friends.  Ha, ha, ha.  Salad with Smith and Wesson oil. 
[01:34:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  And vinegar.  Damn you!  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  How about...  Red mangel ass?  How about...  I want my burger raw, like...

The Give Me Your Wallet waffle fries, and this is a robbery roast beef. 
[01:39:00]  Ronald Reagan on rye.  See, they bring it to you and forget to put the filling in.  It's just rye bread.  I'll take two.  Good.  Very good, guys.  Damn it.  Very good.  Right there in Times Square.  The NRA theme restaurant.  Yes.  Opening within the year, hopefully.  That will make the WWF restaurant seem like Tavern on the Green.

[01:40:00]  People are bad, man.  The JFK Jr. Seafood platter.  Okay.  He didn't even get shot.  I don't care.  You got to get him on the menu.  Heather.  Yeah.  You're out of your mind, man.  That was my husband's input.  Very good.  He also came up with Versace veal.  Versace veal. 
[01:40:30]  We're driving home.  We're peeing our pants.  Cool.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  Damn you.  Why?  Go, go.  Special of the day.  Oh, boy.  The taxicab chicken livery sandwich. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, wow.  I thought we were bad.  Our listeners are ten times worse than we are.  The Cobain head of lettuce.  Oh.  All right.  I can't imagine there's more out there.  No.  I think we covered every major shooting in the past 50 years or so.  We go back to practically 200.  Yes.  I forgot about that.  The Pope John Paul Poppers. 
[01:41:30]  Now, you know, you guys.  Come on.  A lot of people forget he was shot.  Shot.  The Pope.  Parker from the city.  The Columbine Cacciatore.  The Manson Manicotti.  You kill him, we grill him.  I think we're done.  Can you say overkill?  Yeah.  We kill everything.  We don't care.  Zodiac killer birthday cake. 
[01:42:00]  All right.  He died of breast cancer.  Why are you even bringing that up?  Linda McCartney.  You're insane.  It's not funny.  Even if he's rusty.  It's made with rusty.  All right.  Well, thank you for your contributions, you stink.  Aaron Burritos.  Aaron Burritos. 
[01:42:30]  Aaron Burritos.  Aaron Bur.  Someone really knows their history.  Alan Burritos.  Alan Bur.  We're done.  I think we're done.  She wasn't shot.  But it is funny. 
[01:43:00]  Sharon Tater talks.  Larry Flynn fries?  Yeah, Larry Flynn was shot.  All right.  That's why we call it the People's Radio Show.  You guys are crazy.  I'm not what I'm fishing this for.  Martin Luther King crab legs.  Oh, these people are out there. 
[01:43:30]  That was Narene Shatner floating.  She drowned you able.  She certainly didn't float.  God, we came up with seven in the back room.  We've had about a hundred on the radio. 
[01:44:00]  Patty Hearst, Liverwurst.  You're killing me.  Damn them all the hell.  Right.  All right.  I think we need to take a break, Anthony.  Because I'm not stopping.  Well, if a few good ones come through during the commercial, we'll get right back on this.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:44:30]  Hold it slow, baby.  Yeah, sure.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  866-277-4WOW if you want to get a hold of the show today.  Lewis Black in studio from The Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Hi, guys.  What's up, Lewis? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, they screwed up my dry cleaning, so I'm real happy.  Yeah?  Yeah, they washed it, dried it, and folded it.  Has that ever happened to you?  What's wrong with folding?  You don't wash dry cleaning, okay?  It's dry cleaning.  Right.  That was the way the day started.  So they washed it.  Yeah, they washed it.  It's a job.  It's a monkey job.  One bag is wash, dry, fold.  The other bag is dry cleaning.  Dry cleaning.  You got to get your eye.  You don't even pretend you're doing it. 
[01:45:30]  Just pretend iron it.  Send it back dirty.  I don't care.  They're not monkeys that do laundry, Lewis.  No, they're not.  They're chinks.  Oh, okay.  Awful.  Wow.  I heard you're getting very into your clothes these days.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  People have told us.  I know.  Mercurio.  Mercurio told us you're getting very into your clothing.  Well, Paul Mercurio's career is reduced to hanging on to me like some giant blood-sucking  tick.  Oh, man.  Let me get what little tiny bit of fame Lewis has and suck it and try to make it my own 
[01:46:00]  off of my clothes.  Wow.  I wear clothes on stage.  Ha-ha.  That's the thing.  What am I wearing today?  I'm wearing like a T-shirt and a short.  That is a very nice T-shirt.  That's not a T-shirt.  But it's a shirt shirt.  A nice collared shirt.  Oh, it's a collared shirt.  That's going to be at least $70 or $80, that shirt.  Are you insane?  It's a $70 or $80 shirt.  Why can't you dress like Anthony?  I'm in a white T-shirt.  I haven't been home since last night.  Has the word irregular ever occurred to you guys? 
[01:46:30]  What?  He's the designer, irregular.  Oh, is that what that is?  Hello?  Wake up, America.  What's wrong with it?  There's nothing ever wrong with irregular.  It's like a stitch out somewhere, and if somebody notices it, punch them in the face.  Irregular T-shirts fit your body type quite nicely.  Yes, they do.  They certainly do.  They're perfect, especially during the summer when I kind of just swell up to the size  of a large sausage.  It keeps me, it's like I'm wearing casing around.  You want to help us with a brand new segment on the Opie and Anthony? 
[01:47:00]  I will if I can.  Oh, no.  You have lost your mind.  My palms are sweating because I'm kind of feeling bad about this.  You have become baby evil.  He's just become baby evil in my lifetime.  Baby evil.  Baby evil.  What?  It's just a cute little game we like to call.  Has-been corner.  Has-been corner.  You know, you've seen them.  You've seen them around.  They're the people that were famous a long time ago, and they're still around. 
[01:47:30]  They're still breathing and walking, walking the earth.  I want to thank one of my heroes, Andy Kaufman, for this.  Yes.  Andy Kaufman did this on his talk show where he used to sit at this big, huge, giant desk,  and the guests would have to look up at him.  And he had Has-been corner.  And the people would always get pissed off because they didn't know they were walking  into Has-been corner.  They thought they were guests on the show.  Well, we didn't tell Cindy Williams that she's going to be the first guest on Has-been  corner.  No, Cindy Williams, the first ever Has-been corner guest that we have. 
[01:48:00]  She was Shirley on Laverne and Shirley, right?  Yes.  She was Shirley.  All right.  Let's go.  Wow.  Shirley Feeny.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Take a deep breath.  Let's take some breaths because this might be like cringe.  Well, yeah.  This is where you're kind of knocking on the third rung of hell.  Here, God.  Listen, I don't really want to come to heaven.  I've got an idea.  I'm going to screw over this person.  Can I get in maybe to the third rung of hell where you'll be sitting with even bigger 
[01:48:30]  has-beens?  I can't wait for this.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't we get Cindy Williams on the show?  All right.  Here we go.  Wait.  There we go.  Cindy Williams.  Hello.  Hi.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie, Anthony.  How are you guys?  Very well today.  Thank you, Cindy.  And thanks for helping us out with Has-been Corner.  My pleasure.  Great first guest we've ever had on this portion of our program, Cindy. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Did you just make that up or did you steal it from Andy Kaufman?  Stole it from Andy Kaufman.  Ah, got it.  We even said we stole it from Andy Kaufman.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  And I think you're a perfect celebrity to start Has-been Corner with.  Well, thank you.  So what have you been up to, Cindy?  Nothing, as you know.  Otherwise, why would I be in Has-been Corner?  Well, you were on Laverne and Shirley, obviously.  The beloved Shirley Feeney on Laverne and Shirley. 
[01:49:30]  And then after that, there was...  What was that after that?  There was two kids.  Oh, the two kids got in the way?  Yeah.  That's going to be your excuse?  Well...  Do you resent them?  Do you resent them for that?  Totally.  Because you were...  Totally, but not as much as I'm resenting you two right now.  No.  What?  This is all fun, right? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, well, you'll be here one day.  We're not even...  We got to make it first.  Yeah, we got to make it first.  But it's not our goal to make it, so that's okay.  Yeah.  So, Cindy, seriously, what have you been doing the last 20 years?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Okay.  So, like I said, Laverne and Shirley, then...  Nothing.  Really?  No.  Yeah.  No, there must have been something else.  No, you're conducting the interview. 
[01:50:30]  Figure it out.  Like Laverne, she did some movies and stuff.  Right.  She didn't make the cut for Hasmocorner, because she's...  Well, she made some...  Do you talk to her anymore?  Sure, I talk to her all the time.  I don't think this is going well.  Uh, Lewis, do you have a question?  No.  I have nothing.  I'm broken.  Lewis, what's wrong, man?  What's wrong, my friend?  Help us out.  How am I going to help? 
[01:51:00]  What am I going to do?  Cindy Williams.  All right, Cindy, I think we got off on the wrong foot here.  So, what are you promoting today, Ms. Williams?  Nothing, really.  Nothing that I want to tell you two about.  You sure?  Yeah.  You all right?  Well, I'm fine.  You're not going to cry, are you?  This was just supposed to be fun.  And it's a barrel of laughs.  You're going to hurt my feelings if you hang up crying and stuff.  I thought we were, you know, I thought this would be a fun thing to do. 
[01:51:30]  It's a lot of fun.  Okay.  All right.  You sure?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I don't want you to leave and crying or anything.  Okay.  Oh, American Graffiti.  Oh, there you go.  That was before Laverne and Shirley, though.  Oh.  Yeah, way before.  All right.  You weren't in a sitcom after Laverne and Shirley?  No.  Something on the WB or something?  Sort of.  Huh?  But nothing that would interest, you know, any of the listeners. 
[01:52:00]  I think they'd be interested.  See, now I think we got off on the wrong foot.  Opie, I don't think this works.  Yeah.  With the, you know, Cindy, I must say I'm not feeling too good about myself right now.  Well, I'm not feeling too good about myself right now.  I wonder why that would be.  I thought she's getting mad, Opie.  What?  I thought.  No, I'm not mad.  I'm not mad.  I'm just under fluorescent light and, you know, I just am tired. 
[01:52:30]  We'll just put it that way.  But I'm very thankful that you let me be the first guest in your has-been corner.  And I really have nothing to promote, being the has-been that I am.  And I'd like to thank you both very much.  And I really should say goodbye.  Really?  Yeah.  You're not going to be mad?  Yeah, because you shouldn't do this to people. 
[01:53:00]  Do what?  You know, just surprise them like that.  It's like, you know, going on the air.  It's just not nice.  Oh, really?  I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't like you doing that to yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't know.  You know, and no one did tell me that that was going to be the gist of this.  Well, that's Rick Delgado, our producer, who-  Well-  Ow, ow.  Who I think-  Okay.  Ow, ow.  Okay.  Well, that's fine.  That's fine.  Who I think-  I'm just not a real good sport today. 
[01:53:30]  That's all.  And you hurt my feelings.  But-  No.  You really hurt my feelings.  I love you in Laverne and Shirley.  So, don't, you know, you don't need to ever, you know, like, don't watch Laverne and Shirley.  No, I love you in Laverne and Shirley.  But you love the Laverne and Shirley and the Squiggy and the whole gang.  The Big Ragu, right?  The Big Ragu.  Well, sure.  This is a beloved character.  The other has-been?  Well, yeah, we're going to have a has-been weekend, but that's for another day. 
[01:54:00]  Look, we'll-  Okay, well, I'm sure everyone's just going to jump to participate.  Look, we'll never be on a sitcom as great as Laverne and Shirley.  I know.  So, you got that to take home with you today.  Well, I am home.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So, you don't want to promote that you're going to be at the Meadowlands Convention Center  for the Super Mega Show?  No, but thank you very much for that.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, you don't want to promote it at all?  Yes, I'll be there.  I'll be there at the has-been table. 
[01:54:30]  Signing has been autographed.  Why?  Lindsay Wagner's going to be there as well?  Yes.  You might want to call her.  You got her number?  No.  No, I haven't.  All right.  Hey, I like milk and Pepsi.  That wasn't me.  Oh.  It was milk and Pepsi.  Remember, Laverne and Shirley.  I thought that was Shirley, but Laverne used to drink milk and Pepsi all the time.  And she wore the poodle skirt. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  Wow.  I don't...  I feel kind of uncomfortable right now.  I'm overheating.  Boo Boo Kitty was you, right?  That's right.  See, Boo Boo Kitty.  See, I'm a big fan of Laverne and Shirley.  Watch it all the time.  That's great.  So, we encourage all our listeners to go to the Meadowlands Convention Center for Super  Mega Show, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, right?  Yes.  That's right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  All right, Cindy.  Okay.  Thanks, fellas. 
[01:55:30]  Bye.  Bye.  Cindy.  Bye.  All right.  There she goes.  Oh, my God.  No.  I...  You know, that...  Opie, don't look so proud of yourself.  I can't...  I can't...  I can't even...  I can't even not even breathe.  Is that probably the most horrible thing?  It was like being frozen in an ice block and just hearing the words coming out really slowly  like a dagger just...  And the undertone, boy, if you went into the... 
[01:56:00]  What she was subliminally saying, you wouldn't be able to put it on the radio, would you?  You know?  Look, maybe that didn't go as well as...  That was the most interesting thing outside of putting the odd forms of things on a woman's  patoot.  Maybe we should cancel that.  Maybe that was the first and last has-been corner you'll ever hear us doing here on the  show.  Maybe we ought to put it to a little vote with the listeners.  We'll take maybe a few calls and see how it went with them. 
[01:56:30]  Let me...  I got a vote.  We'll see how...  We'll move on with that unless you...  Lewis, you're sitting here with us.  Perhaps it translated different over the air.  Yeah.  Oh!  Are you clinically insane?  Let's talk to Tom.  It comes through the ear.  This is an earpiece.  I heard it.  Let's talk to Tom.  I don't think it was that bad.  Tom?  Guys, guys, that was bad.  That's like seeing a dog hit by the car on the side of the highway and you pull out  a black iron pipe and start to beat it. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, wow.  Well, I guess I was wrong.  Well, okay.  That's one way to look at it.  Sure.  Sure.  That hurt.  I mean, I was cringing and I'm not in the industry at all.  So what you're saying is you didn't like the segment.  No, not at all.  And you would not like to see that ever again, right?  I would not like to hear it ever again.  All right.  Well, there's one.  Well, let's see what Joe has to say.  Joe, what's going on?  Hello?  Hey, Joe.  It's Phil.  Phil, what's up?  Yeah, listen.  That was horrible, guys.  Oh, my God.  Horrible.  I felt like I think she's going to go split her wrist. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  That was horrible.  I'm going to have to make a show.  Hey, man.  I'm not taking all the blame when you said, well, Cindy Williams, you were in Laverne Shirley  and then...  I couldn't offhand think of anything.  I'm sure you didn't have to pause for 10 seconds while you thought about it.  Oh, I'm the guilty one now.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, oh, boy.  Whose idea was this?  What?  You know...  Yours?  Who do you think, Lewis?  I guess every so often I keep thinking, no, it can't be...  Who's the cruelest son of a bitch on the face of the earth? 
[01:58:00]  It can't be Baby Evil, but it is Baby Evil.  Baby Evil.  New name on the message board, Baby Evil.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  That went really well.  I think she's sticking her head in the oven right about now.  Oh, no.  I'm breathing into a paper bag.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I couldn't breathe.  I really couldn't breathe.  I couldn't breathe.  It felt very...  I kept looking...  You know, as a comic, you know, the comedy is tension release, so there's a point where  the tension rises, and we went into, like, overdrive with tension, and it was like you 
[01:58:30]  thought...  You know, I'm racking my brain, trying to go, you know, what can I possibly...  We got sucked into a black hole, man.  No way out at all.  Wow.  She swallowed us.  Lewis, Lewis, you are guilty by association.  Don't try to distance yourself now.  Yeah.  Oh, of course not.  I'm on the bus.  Now I've slaughtered a woman in California.  I can't believe all those notes you were handing me to say.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, those notes, they really went over.  I think Byron has a positive vote for this. 
[01:59:00]  Byron?  Byron.  Yeah, I thought that was about as funny as prostate cancer.  It was like when you say something, you yell at your mom, and she starts to cry.  That's what it sounded like.  Well, the show's not all about giggles and chuckles.  No, I still was laughing anyway.  Boy, that was like...  That was like...  What is that?  You know, that was like behind the music, behind the music, behind the music, behind the  music.  You know, that one moment in time where the manager's looking and saying, 
[01:59:30]  and that's when he stuck the needle in his arm.  Oh, my God.  And I was like, I'm watching you guys.  Before we did this segment, I said it wasn't going to work.  It was like watching you guys get into a big semi-truck, and there's a tiny rodent in  the middle of the street, and you're going, come on, let's get it.  And I said, you know, maybe we should slow down.  Squish.  Unbelievable.  It was unbelievable.  But I've got to say, in terms of reality programming, phenomenal. 
[02:00:00]  You said it, kid.  I'll be laughs.  Oh, boy.  Boy, boy.  Screw you, survivor.  Oh, my God.  That was really bad.  We took her away.  We did three guys get on a boat with her and take her right out of the middle of the ocean  and go, hey, Joe!  So that wasn't funny right there?  No, don't get me wrong.  Did you just enter a pocket of delusion that is so extraordinary?  What?  My delusion.  I wish to God.  You know, I wish people could see your eyes when you just kind of glaze over, and it's 
[02:00:30]  like something from another planet starts talking to you.  So that wasn't funny, I guess.  What were you?  Hello!  I blame my mom.  All I wanted was for her to breastfeed me.  You're unbelievable.  It is just unbelievable.  You guys, really, I wish you guys, I wish you guys had a country.  We're working on it.  We are.  We are.  It used to be called the United States of America, and we're spreading across it. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  All right, we better take a break.  Yeah, let's take a breath.  Yep, sir.  I want to thank Andy Kaufman, wherever you are.  I know you're still alive.  Now, the station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  I felt bad. 
[02:01:30]  Well, I was listening to you the other day.  You have no problem telling it?  No, I don't care.  I don't care.  I was listening to you the other day.  I was driving my wife.  But we also had Kriya in the car.  Oh, no.  Me and Dee are howling as Opie's like, yeah, and I got caught playing, and I went back  to sleep, and I'm howling because I've been caught many times. 
[02:02:00]  Ooh.  Yeah, Opie got caught recently spanking it by his girlfriend.  We rented Rush Hour because I never saw him when it was in theaters.  But I couldn't call in.  I couldn't call in.  Well, I'll just refresh everyone's memory because at least I have someone on my side.  Come on.  Every guy has.  Yeah, but no one around here would admit it.  Every guy has.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I have never been caught.  You are being sexually harassed from the moment you wake up in the morning by your chick.  I swear to you, I've never been caught. 
[02:02:30]  Brewer, this is the third time for me.  It's been at least three, and it always causes big fights.  She flips out.  Really?  And I thought she was asleep because I looked.  You know, you start with like, you start slowly, you know what I mean?  And then you're like, well, I've got to get some friction going.  Well, what happened?  So I turned around.  She's on the couch.  I got to get some friction going.  Well, at first, I was like, whoa, hey, look at this.  This feels nice.  You know?  That old cartoon.  At first, you could be in the mode like, I don't want to be bothered. 
[02:03:00]  There's too much work, maybe.  And then the second you're getting into it, it's like, why am I not doing this all the  time?  Why am I not quitting my job and doing this full time?  So when it really started, you know, I started getting into her, I looked behind me to make  sure, you know, she's still asleep.  And she was asleep.  But Lou, would you give her a little peek?  Would you give her the fish eye?  Oh, yeah.  I turned around.  I was like, oh, wait a minute.  You got to understand.  She was two feet behind me. 
[02:03:30]  You're very quiet.  You get the quiet method.  And now I got...  You're quiet.  Just the thumb movement.  You get the real quiet method.  Just the thumb movement.  Just maybe like the inside right here, like the wrist area.  Yeah.  Thumb movement, light movement, and pressure with the pinky, ring, and middle finger.  So then I adjust the pillow.  I'm getting all set.  And I look behind me.  I'm like, all right.  She's still asleep.  And now it's time to get down to business.  I guess I was shaking the whole room because she woke up.  Well, you know what happens?  No joke.  Because we have, like, all these stupid things in my living room.  And some of the crap is... 
[02:04:00]  Well, what happens in this situation, it's sort of like going...  You know when you start drinking, you don't realize you're drinking and having a good time?  So you start talking like this?  Yo, I got to take your beach.  You see the mits?  Why would you bring up Benitez?  He sucks.  He sucks.  So when you start getting into that thing, it takes over.  You're getting into the zone.  You don't realize you're doing it right here.  You don't, yeah.  So we got on the air the other day.  That's Chris Rock, by the way, that talks about the nobody's home jerk. 
[02:04:30]  What does he say?  What does he say?  You get in the good nobody's home jerk.  Well, no one's home.  You can go to town.  You can go to town.  You can do whatever you want in whatever room.  You can do the roast beef.  It don't matter.  So nobody's home jerk.  So it turns out that.  Everybody's home.  Here's nobody home.  Scream if you want to. 
[02:05:00]  You can play on a piano.  It's that dark.  I don't care because nobody's home.  It's just me and the dog.  Nobody's home jerk.  So, uh, make a look.  That is a good jerk.  When nobody's home.  The nobody's home jerk.  Ow, ow. 
[02:05:30]  I've been shaking in the bed like a crackhead.  But it's okay because nobody's home.  I've been putting pillows together.  Making it look like a ass.  And I've been doing the home jerk.  I've been banging.  I've put up other pillows, make them watch.  See, you're next.  I've put a satin pillow on the pillow.  Kind of jerk. 
[02:06:00]  I use every room in the house.  I don't care.  No one's home.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  On my donkey.  I'm going to get a donkey by all kind of jerk.  I'm doing it in front of the TV.  I'm doing it in front of the fridge.  I got pillows and how it is.  I love the country.  Nobody home jerk. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  Joe Rogan.  You ever hear that, dude?  Yeah.  He goes, the worst part about when you're playing, when you're doing the donkey,  is you're going to have to play.  And always when you finish, it's always like, what's wrong with me?  You got your donkey in your hand and just on tinge.  Like, what's wrong with me?  So what happened?  What happened? 
[02:07:00]  Nice head, dude.  Make a long story short, I thought I was safe and, you know, did the thing.  It turns out when we got Cindy on the air, because she, I thought she caught me,  but we didn't really want to talk about it around the house.  That's not what you're talking about.  So I figured I'd bring it up on the air where, you know, it's a little safer to discuss things openly.  And it turns out that she did open up her eyes during the whole thing, and she was scared at what she was seeing,  so she made believe she was sleeping for the rest of it. 
[02:07:30]  So she has to sit there and make believe you're sleeping.  What to do?  What to do?  Yeah.  All right, Brewer.  Wow.  Now let's get back to the joke.  Oh, you're not off now.  Oh, come on, man.  We're past that.  Now, I told him the whole story, and you were listening in the car with your lovely...  See you later.  ...your lovely wife.  Make sure you write us in a week. 
[02:08:00]  We'll come back, Nathan.  Grab on to the wrap.  Why do you have to put your glasses on for this story?  Because it's embarrassing.  It stones me.  They don't want to look people in the eye when he talks about being a filthy animal like that.  Filthy animal to himself.  Cranking it.  You know how embarrassed you feel the second it's all over.  So you're in the car with your wife and your grandma listening to this crap.  Yeah, I'm listening, and I want to call because I instantly started laughing.  Actually, Dee laughed even harder. 
[02:08:30]  Because for...  I'm married eight years, man.  We've known each other a long time.  You do a lot of donkey playing.  A lot of times when you do it.  Well, a couple times I almost got caught, and she'd have a talk with me.  But a similar...  Like your mom.  I'm dumb.  Now, you really got to stop doing that.  If you want it, just come to me.  Oh, right.  Okay. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, all right.  Hi, how are you doing?  Listen, can we do it right now?  Because, you know, I want to, yeah.  And the time I got caught, the one big time, it turned into a big fight because she turned...  First of all, you feel like a dick that you caught.  You feel like a dick.  There's nothing more humiliating.  I will take stepping in human feces and bare feet.  Or you're standing there naked with your donkey in your hand, and you have another human being,  your wife, looking at you in disbelief, like, what is wrong with you? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah.  So I instantly took the defense, and I went, nothing.  I tried to play it like that.  Oh, no.  So I went, nothing.  I'm just, nothing.  So there's that weird barrier of, am I going to get away with this?  No.  Can we just drop this?  Because you really don't want to go to battle here.  You were dressed, though?  Like you had something on?  No, no, no. 
[02:10:00]  How did you cover up?  Hands were off.  How did you cover up?  I couldn't.  I just, I jumped on the side of the bed.  I was next to the bed.  So I leaned down like I was trying to take a nap real quick.  I was napping.  I'm napping.  This is a labor excuse that I don't think.  Well, you had no excuses.  Well, you got no excuses.  You said, well, how do you get out of this?  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Sleeping.  So I lay down, and she's like, so there's that tense moment. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, no.  Like, please, you know what's going on.  Just drop it.  Drop it.  All right?  Let's make believe this didn't happen, okay?  So what, you know, and there's that weird moment, and she goes, are you playing with  yourself?  Oh, no.  That's not, I'm really mad right now.  Oh, like, you're not humiliated enough.  I'm really mad.  I go, what, why are you mad?  She goes, that really offends me.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  So now, you know, this is when you lose it. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, no.  This is when you go, well, it shouldn't offend you.  Well, it does.  How does it feel?  I'm standing here in front of you.  Do I, do I never give it to you?  I mean, how wrong is that?  And you feel the need that you have to hide on me and touch and play with yourself?  That's disturbing.  Let's not forget you're naked as you're yelling at yourself.  That doesn't happen.  So then I.  On his side, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing.  And then first you take the, first I took the argument of, um, I attacked her like this. 
[02:11:30]  I said, well, I didn't want to bother you.  Because you said you were tired last night because the baby got up early.  What'd you say all day?  You got mad on me.  As soon as I woke up, you're like, I'm eating that today.  And I let you nap.  Did I not do that?  Yes.  I did.  And I said, you look really good.  And so you said you were tired.  You went downstairs.  You said you were tired.  You took a nap.  So I started playing myself.  So, all right?  Is that all right with you?  I'm trying to help you out.  And you're making me feel like a dick.  It's so true. 
[02:12:00]  You guys know what I'm talking about.  Yes, I do.  Oh, my gosh.  You try to spin it.  You try to spin it and get out of it.  Turn it around.  But my wife, she knows me.  Look, the only human beings that are going to know you your entire life better than you  is your wife.  And the reason you get so pissed at her is because she's so on and right.  But you don't want to face it.  So she goes, you'd even think, you know what?  I wouldn't be offended if you at least tried.  But you didn't try.  You just decided you're going to go up and play with yourself. 
[02:12:30]  Why didn't you compare your venom at me?  See?  Not taking that route.  Yeah, well, you're there yelling at your wife now, just sporting naked, and you're  sporting, and you're just standing there now.  Like, is that pretty much takes you about five ticks down on the advantage scale, you  know?  You're done.  Arguing naked, bad.  And what sucks for me is I've got three, I have weird roots.  It sounds worse than it is, but there's three mirrors.  It sounds way worse than it is, trust me. 
[02:13:00]  So I've got two angles on me so I can see myself.  And then I realize this while I'm caught in the middle of this whole thing.  Were you able to pull covers over yourself?  Look at me.  I'm hot.  Oh, no.  I quickly, once we got over the thing, I quickly put up my, you know.  But now she's standing there as you're putting pants on.  And look at how hot I am.  God, is that horrible.  What?  No, I can't look at myself.  I lose.  I'm like, oh, man.  Oh, baby.  Baby, look in Mirror 3.  This reminds me of the dude in American Psycho when he's banging those two chicks, but he's  looking at himself in the mirror while he's flexing his thighs. 
[02:13:30]  That's hilarious.  Huey Lewis and the News.  This is Susudio.  This is Bill Collins.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  There he is.  The color is bone.  Bone.  With a font that I picked.  I love that movie.  You've got to tell the last part where she caught you in the...  Which one?  After you did the concert and all that and you were, you know, a little... 
[02:14:00]  Which one?  What?  I need to get a language here, Ope.  Help me out.  He's like, you know, if you guys could see Ope right now, he's just leaning his head to  the right and going, you know, when you...  That was my visual for, like, you know, being high.  Like, being a little under the...  Oh, my God.  Then you've got to deal with it.  When you were downstairs, like, you said, jamming, like, Judas Priest or something, giving  yourself a concert and then decided...  Whoa.  Oh, no. 
[02:14:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  When I got some spare time, you always revert back to being 16.  Always.  Yeah.  Like, you know, Chris Rock.  You got to have a...  We call it the Rob Halford jerk.  Scream!  The Dungeons!  Nothing better than the Rob Halford jerk.  Now, that's a good...  Judas Dickerson's run-to-the-hills kind of jerk. 
[02:15:00]  Rob Halford, Judas Priest jerk.  I'm a jerk.  Wearing leather and a bullwit.  Talking about living after midnight kind of jerk.  This is like jerkin' after midnight.  There we go.  Jerk in!  After midnight!  Jerk in! 
[02:15:30]  Till the dawn!  Till the morning!  Then I'm gone!  I'm gone!  Are you having a, um, a concert with yourself?  Jerk in!  Jerk in!  Nice head, Dick.  See you again!  Jerk in!  Jerk in!  Wait, what's he say?  I come alive!  I come alive!  Yeah, he comes alive!  That's when my jerk man goes, all right! 
[02:16:00]  At the midnight!  Jerk in!  To the dawn!  Walk it off, Dick.  The volume of you're gonna be down when you're jerkin' it to Judas Priest.  You can't jerk it if the music's too loud.  Jerk in!  You're gonna get caught jerkin' if the music's too loud.  I put it! 
[02:16:30]  I put that big ball in my mouth, and I start jerkin' like the gift, and I put on it.  Ha, ha, ha, ha!  Jerk in!  Till the dawn!  When I'm home alone, 95% of the time I spend jerkin'.  Oh, here we go, wait.  Ha, ha, ha!  I'm the baby!  I'm the baby!  Wait, wait, wait! 
[02:17:00]  Wait, wait, wait, what's the name?  I'm gonna blow you!  Perfect!  Wait, wait, wait, wait!  This one's a good one.  My body's coming!  Yes, right?  Oh, my love!  Oh, my love!  Is that okay? 
[02:17:30]  Oh, you're like, don't you faggot.  I'm getting hotter by the hour.  Oh, my God.  I'm getting hotter by the hour.  Burn it!  I'm getting my spice to metal.  This song is about s***.  There you go.  That's what I call the rock and roll jerk.  And that's a good jerk. 
[02:18:00]  Heavy metal, when you've been banging your head, leather of your snout kind of jerk.  We're talking love, fights, screaming for vengeance.  Rubber, rubber gags, and zippers.  We're talking, run to the hills, master of puppets, checkin'.  Master, master, master of jerkin' is pulling his legs!  Jack from Philly checkin', and he says, there's no way out of it when you get caught beating it. 
[02:18:30]  But there is a way to minimize the damage.  Look her right in the eye while still stroking and say, look what you're making me do!  Get down on your knees, start crying, look what you're making me do!  What have you brought me to?  I got no place else to jack!  I got no place else to jack!  Don't you make me stop doing this!  Don't you!  I got no place else to jack! 
[02:19:00]  I ain't got nothing!  And I believe that would be the closer!  That's the officer and the gentleman jerk!  That's the Richard Gilder!  Oh, God.  Wow!  That hurt.  But, Brewer, you were under the influence of...  You were jamming Judas Priest or something?  I can't get through this story, huh? 
[02:19:30]  That's fine.  You didn't.  Ah, we get the image.  Just the big look.  You went up coming downstairs, the music's right in your eye, naked.  Oh, dude.  I wasn't naked!  Was this before or after that other episode?  Don't swap things, man.  Don't be serious, don't be serious.  I wasn't naked.  But you have to be naked.  I had my underwear on.  Now, is this before or after the other episode you just talked about?  Oh, this is after.  Oh, man.  So she must have been like...  Didn't we talk about this?  You have a problem!  Well, honestly, what I did, I pulled that as a front. 
[02:20:00]  Because now I'm going to go downstairs and writing, you know.  Living at midnight, rock it like a rainbow in the dark.  All right, you have a little concert.  I'm tearing it up in my basement.  And then, you know, I wait until she falls into the story, keep it going, and then...  All right. 
[02:20:30]  Start working it.  Well, you know, came down, and again.  Oh, no!  You're right.  There is no thrown in jail for the night.  There is no...  Can we ask you some questions?  Yeah.  You're thrown on the stand immediately.  Blink!  What the hell?  What did you just say to me?  Just...  Is there a problem?  I've got to go that route.  The problem.  Yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Now there must be a problem.  God, that's funny.  That's it.  This is not getting better than that today, right?  There you go.  Bravo.  Wow.  I can't...  Well...  I would laugh that hard.  It's embarrassing, man.  It's a long time.  But I get...  I usually get madder.  I'm like, well, you know...  Don't walk around.  You know that gets me...  Well, can't you control it?  No!  I cannot!  That is why I've got to run in high! 
[02:21:30]  It is worse than heroin!  When are you females going to realize that it's a gene?  It's a fluid in our body!  You show us anything, and we immediately...  Where can I go?  Really?  Like an ape, yeah.  Throw my feces.  Come on.  You're all lying if it's not the truth.  No, it is absolutely the truth.  Oh, God.  That's too good.  All right.  How many people are going to do the Judas Priest jerk, man? 
[02:22:00]  See?  There you go.  The Judas Priest jerk!  Yeah.  We better take a break, huh?  All right.  Jesus Christ.  I have a blast.  Too much fun.  And more on the way.  O.P. and Anthony.  Every afternoon, including Saturday afternoon.  1027 WNEW.  Yeah, okay. 
[02:22:30]  Back to the news, huh?  With a 911 call.  Let's check out the 911 call.  All right.  Hey, County Police and Fire.  Where's your emergency?  We have a problem here.  I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab.  We've been doing drugs with Pedro.  Oh, yes.  Does anybody there need rest here?  No.  We've been doing drugs for two days with Pedro.  We've been doing drugs with Pedro.  Oh, we just got arrested.  Oh, okay.  With cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to leave her out and go into rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now? 
[02:23:00]  No, no, no.  You've got one.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does it go to the end?  No.  That's my favorite.  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time.  Not this time.  She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons.  Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody?  No, not this time.  I've got to hear that again.  That is it.  Okay.  I've got cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to leave her house and go into rehab right  now. 
[02:23:30]  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, no, no.  Does anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no.  Does the girl need a rescue?  No, she doesn't need a rescue.  All right.  Hold on, and I'll bring her to help you.  You're trying to tell her.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, don't get started on that again.  No, no.  No weapons.  That's in the golf bag.  I mean, I don't know where the knife is.  That's in a lake in Chicago.  Don't make me get on a plane.  Oh, I cut my knuckle on the nine when I was dialing 911.  That's where the blood's from. 
[02:24:00]  I swear.  Where's Robert Kardashian?  Help me, please.  I was like, no.  What a tool.  No, no, no.  Don't think that.  No, no.  Someone hurt.  Need rescue?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I love it.  Don't make me get a Bronco.  Now, what does he do?  Does he call 911 back?  Oh, no.  911 calls his home, I believe.  I guess they were disconnected or something, and then 911 usually calls back.  Okay.  So, here's the second half.  Hello, OJ House. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, wait.  Hang out.  I want you to call the police.  Hello?  Okay.  This is the juice.  Now, what happened?  I don't know.  You hear OJ going, I want you to call the police.  I had to hit her over the head with the phone receiver.  He was disconnected.  I like him.  Hello?  This is the police department.  Oh, she left, and I don't know what to do about it.  Man, I'm frustrated. 
[02:25:00]  This guy, Pedro Guerrero, got arrested by 15 keys of cocaine.  This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him.  Me and her friend just came over and said, you're going into a rehab.  She's got mad.  She's just got her car.  She drives a Mercedes.  She lives in the crossings.  Now, it's loaded out of her mind.  Get her a Mustang driving around town somewhere.  What other is a Mustang?  What other is a Mustang?  She drives his license number, but she needs to be stopped.  What other is a Mustang?  It's white. 
[02:25:30]  It's a black car.  Like a Bronco.  Is she black and white?  She's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go and see if I can find her.  Okay.  That's all I need, a white girl.  This has got to be a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling's driving.  O.J. calls 911.  Is O.J. putting out a prank call tape?  Is that what's going on here?  The best of O.J.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  O.J. calls 911. 
[02:26:00]  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running there?  Yes, it is.  Well, you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello, do you have Prince Albert in a can?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in a can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the O.J. Simpson 911 comedy tape. 
[02:26:30]  All of yours now.  Hello, is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You skipped against the O.J. Simpson.  I got to go now. 
[02:27:00]  I got to find us.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh?  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do the famous butt plug.  I got to try to call it.  Hello, 911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  Laugh along with your favorite murderer, O.J. 
[02:27:30]  911?  Yes?  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother...  Does O.J. do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape? 
[02:28:00]  Kind of like the Jerky Boys?  I'll come down there with my toolbox.  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Or a knife.  I'm O.J.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  Oh, man.  That's the O.J. Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now. 
[02:28:30]  Friggin' O.J.  He's back.  I love him.  Thank God.  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  A four-hour parade of meat.  Oh, this girl is so friggin' hot, too, man.  She was at our impromptu little road show we did at LaVar Bad about a month ago. 
[02:29:00]  Yes.  And she has volunteered to allow us to drip hot wax all over her smokin' body.  Hot wax.  Her smokin' body.  What's her name, Rick?  Jill.  Okay.  I remember.  I don't know what her name is, but I remember her face.  Jill.  Why don't you bring her in?  You'll remember, Jill.  But she showed everyone her ass all night in LaVar Bad, and it was a lovely, look at  this thing.  Oh, yes.  I remember.  Sure.  Wow.  How you doing?  Great to see you again, Jill.  Well, Jill is beautiful. 
[02:29:30]  What nationality are you?  Italian.  Yeah.  She's Italian.  Yeah.  A hundred percent, it looks like.  So, have you had wax dripped all over your body before?  No.  I've never had.  Really?  Really, no?  I'm a virgin.  You're a wax virgin?  Yeah, we were.  Virgin.  There was, there's some really hot MTV video.  I don't even know the song, don't know the band, but there was a scene where the guy's  just dripping hot wax all over the girl, and it's not the Ricky Martin video, because  there was some of that going on in La Vida Loca.  Yeah, whatever.  Whatever that stupid song was, this one was a much hotter scene than we saw yesterday. 
[02:30:00]  There's a whole trick to it, you know.  You don't get too close with the wax.  Right.  Have you had it done?  So, it's not hot.  No, I've just seen it in porno.  Have you had it done?  I've had it done, yeah.  Oh, you have?  Yeah, you've got to make sure you drip the wax from high above.  Ah!  Yeah, that would, that would mean a little hot too close.  A little too close.  Ouch. 
[02:30:30]  Ouch.  Ouch.  All right, Jill, now, where would you like the wax dripped?  Should we start with the stomach, maybe?  And work our way up, kind of?  Well, Ann, I think we're ready.  Yeah, I think so.  All right, where's the candles?  Candles from the wonderful Yank Me Candle Company.  All right, we're going to start with, whoa, we're going to start with the stomach, you  said?  Sure.  The stomach?  You've got to lose the shirt, then.  Look at that, you've got to lose the shirt.  Come on.  All right, well, let's start with the stomach. 
[02:31:00]  What do you mean?  All right, on the counter how?  Yeah, just, you could lay right out there.  Just don't hit any of those vital cough buttons.  Hey, let's move over to these mics.  All right.  Foot, if you would take my mic.  There we go.  Wow.  Yeah, that's the interrogation mic.  Look at this.  She's, wow.  She's, wow, she's, I can't really hear myself.  She's lounged out.  What are you doing there, Rick?  All right.  She said no pics.  She agreed without her face. 
[02:31:30]  There are no tapes.  I swear.  There are no tapes.  Where's Liddy?  Maybe he can plant a camera.  She's in a really hot position right now.  Yeah.  We're way above her.  Her stomach is, your stomach is perfect.  What size boobs you got there?  Um, I guess 34B.  34B.  34B.  They're nice.  Very nice.  Okay, we're lighting the candles, Anthony.  All right.  Let's get this lit.  Make sure you scream right into the mic.  Oh, she's undoing her pants, Anthony.  Yeah, you don't want any wax to get on those really nice pants. 
[02:32:00]  Wouldn't it be a shame if that nice bra got a last.  Oh, look at these panties that we're about to see.  Yeah.  Don't be shy.  What are those?  Oh, yeah.  A little leopard print.  Those are like Victoria's Secrets, right?  Very good.  I know my panties.  You're going to have to edge toward Opie a little more because I'm not going to be able  to hold the candle high enough with the top of the thingy here.  Here, pull her pants down.  Pull her.  Pull her.  Pull her down.  Oh, okay, boys.  You just can't wait.  Well, I don't want to.  You have really nice pants on, and I don't want to get the wax all over your pants. 
[02:32:30]  It'll be okay for now.  Thanks for your concern.  Okay.  All right, Ann, you want to start?  Yeah, I'll start.  You're a little closer to the stomach area.  You better get up high, though.  Let's get up high.  I will.  All right, what do you.  Tell me if it hurts.  What are you aiming for?  Ow.  A fire.  Does that hurt?  Yeah, that burns a little.  Yeah, it will.  It's hot wax.  Yeah.  All right, let me do a couple.  Where are those lead soldiers?  Let's melt a few of those down.  All right, wait.  Move closer to the edge, though, so I can get the candle higher.  You actually have to move up your head toward Opie a little more.  I'm going to end up going up the counter. 
[02:33:00]  We get paid to do this stuff?  No.  Just kind of wrap around the counter a little.  All right, I'm going to.  Oh, you've got to go.  I'm aiming right for the belly button.  Yeah, you are.  Oh!  Oh!  That had to hurt.  I'll go higher.  How's that?  Oh, my God.  Ah!  Hey, I'm not stopping.  It's like Asian torture.  Oh, my God.  All right, she's squirming.  Wait, there's too much green wax.  I'm the red wax guy.  Hey, get higher.  Higher.  All right, all right.  My God, you're going to cook the porn girl. 
[02:33:30]  Is there a stool or something you can stand up?  Oh, my God.  Am I going to get this stuff off?  Look at her.  Look at her.  She's, like, squirming.  Wow, this is great.  This rocks.  All right, roll over.  Let's do your ass.  Huh?  Didn't you say you wrote your name on somebody once?  Yeah, yeah.  Why don't we do that with wax?  How did we do that then?  Well, this girl was dead.  She was a corpse, so she really didn't move that much.  Oh, wait.  Oh, now we've got a pedestal.  I wish Martha Stewart would do something like this with candles.  Ow.  Yeah.  Take out my headphones.  What a great way to spend the holidays, dripping hot wax on people. 
[02:34:00]  I'm going high.  Are we going for the butt now?  Is that her?  Peel some off.  See what it looks like under that.  Hey, Opie, be careful.  It's going to fall and shove the candle somewhere.  Ow, by the way, I just got some on my finger and it hurts from about an inch away.  Ow, ow, ow.  What body part are we going for now?  The ass.  She's got to lose the pants.  Yeah, lose the pants.  Okay.  Lose them.  Can I just, like, choose them?  Well, you can keep trace of them, but...  But all the way, can I just take them down?  No, you can pull them down. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah, that's fine.  And then we'll make you walk around.  Hey, she just hit Rick.  Cool.  Wow.  She's got a thong on.  That's pretty nice.  All right, she's turning over.  She's got a perfect, perfect ass.  Look at that ass.  Whoa.  We are speechless.  All right, Rick's getting a picture for, of course, the unofficial website.  That could be the best ass we've ever had in the studio, Anthony.  Bravo.  Turn to the mic, because we want our listeners to hear this. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, just like that.  All right, I'm sorry.  A little higher.  A little higher, maybe.  Okay.  Wow.  Ow, ow, ow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the cheek.  Wow, it's squirming around like crazy.  Oh, she's losing it.  Okay.  She's losing it.  How cool is that, man?  Is there a home version of this game?  Jill, how's it feeling?  Did you think it would sting that much? 
[02:35:30]  No.  Are you liking it?  That was there.  That was there.  Anthony just threw a lit match at her.  Wait, I want one more.  I'm going way up high here.  Move your butt to the edge.  Yes.  All right, here we go.  I'm going for the right cheek.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It almost tickles.  It almost tickles.  It hurts, but it tickles.  Oh, my God.  Look at that one.  Isn't that funny?  She looks like some wacky kind of alien creature's ass. 
[02:36:00]  Because, like, it's got the green and red dot com.  It kind of looks like a disease.  Oh, my God.  Okay, now we're going to push on the right into the universe.  Is that okay?  All right.  Are you taking a picture of the waxed ass?  No, get the other angle, man.  Oh, Anthony, quit here.  Oh, my God.  That was like a whole cup full.  All right, hurry go.  It's starting to really build up in here.  Now, Jill, is it erotic at all or no? 
[02:36:30]  It could be.  It could be?  Okay, how about boobage?  Oh, I don't know.  Yeah, boobage.  We'll go from way high up.  We'll go way high.  It'll be completely dry by the time.  Actually, you could get on the floor.  It won't feel anything like this.  Get on the floor.  All right, she's going after it.  Come here.  Give me your ass.  No.  Give me your ass.  It's not going to show his ass.  No.  It's not going to show his ass.  No, do it on my hand.  We'll let you do it on your hands. 
[02:37:00]  We'll let you do it on your hands.  Come on, do it on your hands.  No way.  I'm not pulling down my hands.  Jill, it's not happening.  Jill, get on the floor because I'm way up high here.  Someone light my candle fast.  Light man, thank you.  And get way up here.  Are we going for the boobs from 20 feet up?  Yeah.  And now Jill's on the floor.  We're about 15 feet up in the air.  We're aiming for the boobs, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  We'll have people leave the studio if you feel uncomfortable. 
[02:37:30]  No, I'll take off my bra.  Oh, she's going to take off her bra.  Don't hit her face.  Oh, my God.  Don't hit her face.  All right, cover her face because this could be a problem.  Hold on.  Put a paper bag on her head.  No offense because you do have a very nice face, but get a paper bag for her head.  No, that ain't going to work.  Get a paper bag.  I'm serious.  A paper bag for her head.  She'll be the unknown lesbian.  All right, Jill.  Wow, this is a very nice position you got there, Jill. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, she can do that.  You don't want to get any on that bra, though.  No, it's all right.  No, we need the bra off.  Yeah, we do.  Yeah.  If you cover your face, she'll be fine.  You have nothing to hide.  Trust me.  All right, Ann.  I feel special.  She'll take her bra off for us.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, here comes the bra.  Oh, wow.  Hey, nice.  There we go.  That is some fine ta-tas.  Okay.  Wait, move the bra because I'm going to rock.  Yeah.  Dude, you sure you don't want to give her like a bag or something for her head? 
[02:38:30]  Hold it close because it might be splatter.  Yeah.  Like hold it under your chin kind of.  Yeah, there you go.  Ready?  I'm way above it.  Here it comes.  I'm way above.  A little higher.  Oh, stay away from the head.  Oh, my God.  That would have hit her right in the face.  All right, she's squeezing her boobs together because of the pain.  I'm going to try for the nip.  Okay, I'm going for the nip.  Oh, my God.  Pilot to bomb again.  It hurts.  It hurts.  All right, back off.  All right, back off for a second.  Let's see who got closer.  I got closer to the bullseye.  You did?  Yeah, you have the right boob. 
[02:39:00]  I have the left one, and my wax got closer.  Wow.  You have green.  I wish I could say what that looks like right now.  That's pretty good.  That is good.  You've done this before.  It's like a Norton bombsite.  The Enola game.  All right.  It was off the tarmac.  All right, one more.  It's like Bozo the Clown.  One more splatter.  Okay.  One more pass, and we'll be done.  Here we go.  Ready?  From above.  Oh, ha, ha.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Walk it in.  Oh, I almost got.  Oh, bullseye.  Oh, you got it.  Oh, yeah, I feel it.  Anthony wins.  Somebody got a bullseye.  She is shaking. 
[02:39:30]  Anthony wins.  Anthony wins.  I think she has a wood floor.  Really?  Yeah, look.  You need that wax?  Well, Jill, how did that feel?  Not bad.  Yeah?  Pretty good.  It's pretty good.  Pretty good.  More ass, guys?  Yeah, turn over on your butt.  Rick, the ass got more ass.  Rick, can you get it down?  Oops, with the wax all over him?  Okay.  All right, turn over.  You know what?  Let me get one more.  It's like stiff.  Yes. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, it is.  Yes.  Oh, I thought you were talking about our pants.  No, of course she's talking about the wax all over her chest, Anthony.  Okay.  Looks like she has the measles.  Mercy.  Oh, my God.  It feels really weird.  Yeah, it does feel weird.  All right.  All right.  We're going for the butt.  We're going for the butt.  Back to the ass.  Oh, she's cursed.  She's cursed. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right.  She's grabbing at us.  She's in pain.  She's had it.  She's had enough.  She's had enough.  She tapped out.  She tapped out.  One, two, three.  She's out.  May I kind of burn?  You think?  Jill, talk into the mic.  How does that feel?  Not bad.  It feels okay.  All right.  Peel one off.  Let me see what it looks like underneath.  Peel off a little thing.  That one's in red. 
[02:41:00]  Is it red?  No.  No, she's fine.  Oh, you take it like a champ.  Yes, I do.  Those are only third-degree burns.  Cool.  The hospital's really close to here.  Napalm.  All right.  That was, like, the best thing I've ever done.  Snake and nape that ass.  All right, Ann.  Wow.  Rocked.  That was pretty cool.  That was real cool.  Psycho Mark's coming in with his own candle that he wants to drip on.  Put that away, Mark. 
[02:41:30]  She's got a little wick anyway.  All right.  Jill's getting her clothes back on.  The phone's just going nuts here, Anthony, as you would expect.  Jack, what's up?  I can't walk.  Jack.  I can't walk.  Hey, what's up?  Wow, look at all the wax.  Jeff, not Jack.  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  What's up?  You guys are killing me.  You obviously have a girl there with very sensitive, delicate skin.  Now that you have your pot wax on her, can't you at least soothe her with a tongue bath  or some ice cubes?  Would you like some ice cubes, Jill?  Actually, I might.  Oh.  Oh.  Look at him rise. 
[02:42:00]  See?  Oh.  Rick, run.  Run like the wind, Rick.  Four guys just died.  Oh, there you go.  A couple of icy cold Budweiser's.  Buds.  We're not drinking them.  They just happen to be in the area and they're ice cold.  Oh, there you go.  They're icing.  I don't have a boyfriend, so what is it?  Oh, my God.  He's a friend.  He's a friend.  The other guy that walked in all of a sudden now is like, get out.  All right.  They're icing down the area.  Icing down her butt with a couple of cold buds. 
[02:42:30]  Yes.  Don't you guys owe it to her to at least be the ones to ice her down?  You did inflict the pain.  I do want to go home tonight, sir.  Don't you have an almost divorcee in that studio with you?  I'm impending litigation, sir.  I think. </pre>
