<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Anthony recounting his experience receiving a speeding ticket for driving 95 mph in a 55 mph zone, compounded by additional tickets for a missing license plate and expired insurance. Despite attempting to use his connections, the officer, aware of the show, remained unyielding.  This led to a discussion of "cuddle parties," which the hosts found absurd and discussed at length, imagining various scenarios and ultimately deciding to organize their own.  Numerous listener calls contributed to this segment.  Jimmy, the regular co-host, was present throughout.

The discussion of cuddle parties continued, fueled by news reports and audio clips.  The hosts, using crude and offensive language, focused on the "Rule 7" – no dry humping – and the inherent potential for sexual arousal.  This segued into a discussion of a video of Reginald Denny (context unclear), speculation about the physical appearance of cuddle party attendees, and an attempt to contact Greg Packer, a self-promoter who had attended a cuddle party.

A wide array of other topics were interspersed throughout the broadcast.  These included a news story about a spider named after Neil Young; Jenna Bush's wedding; box office results for *Iron Man* and *Speed Racer*; a clip of Sandy Cain, a burlesque dancer who had previously been a guest, whose age and appearance were discussed with crude humor; George Carlin's birthday and his HBO specials; Opie's emotional reaction to his deceased father's phone number being reassigned; a discussion of drummers, focusing on Lars Ulrich and Neil Peart; negative opinions on the Nintendo Wii, specifically *Cooking Mama*; a prank played on Charles Barkley; upcoming comedy shows featuring Robert Kelly and Patrice O'Neal; Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and a controversial quote; Barack Obama's comment about visiting 57 states; news items about Bill O'Reilly and a woman stabbing her boyfriend while watching pornography; and the impending departure of an unnamed staff member.

The show then shifted to Al Sharpton's unpaid taxes and O.J. Simpson's alleged confession, followed by a performance of offensively absurd horoscopes by studio guest Club Soda Kenny.  Further segments featured a Bill O'Reilly clip showing him struggling with a teleprompter, a news story about a 13-year-old hiring prostitutes, a pelican striking a swimmer, an uncensored audio clip of a sexual encounter with a deaf woman, and a discussion about a band fronted by a man with Down syndrome ("Bill"), focusing heavily on their name and an interview, which included highly offensive and derogatory comments about the band members' appearance and intelligence, interspersed with mentions of positive fan reactions. A Hustler magazine was shown during a discussion about its cartoons.  The departure of a staff member was again teased.


A later segment featured the Alec Baldwin voicemail, further discussion of Anthony's speeding ticket (including a humorous audio clip), the introduction and extensive playing of "Dirty Potter" (an obscenely altered Harry Potter audiobook), the Suge Knight altercation, clips of Andy Rooney complaining about gifts, discussion of the delayed Sirius XM merger, a listener's call about the China earthquake, and a return to the topic of cuddle parties, all laced with graphic and sexually suggestive language.  The band "Bill" was again mocked extensively.  The show also mentioned the movie "Foot Fist Way."

The final segment included the hosts making fun of a listener's appearance, announcing (again) the departure of a staff member without revealing their identity, discussing a listener gift of a used drill (resulting in insults and vulgar language towards Jimmy), and the host referring to himself as "The Drill Diva."  The entire broadcast was characterized by consistently vulgar and offensive language, targeting a wide range of individuals and subjects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Chalk Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Chalk Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Chalk Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Chalk Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Chalk Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Do you play a prostitute? Bipolar?  I'm doing fantastic.  Jimmy's in love.  Wonderful. Both qualities I look for when I meet someone.  We are sick. Freaks.  Chris Benoit.  Oh boy.  Bipolar.  I leaned on the machine by accident and it hit a button. 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  How fast did you get it up to?  180 miles an hour.  What's the matter with you, idiot?  Cut the s***.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Hey.  Another week of radio about to begin.  Here it is.  How was everyone's weekend?  Everyone's Mother's Day?  Mother's Day was...  Mother's Day.  Awesome!  Was it?  No.  Aw.  It was alright.  I had a pretty awesome Mother's Day.  You did?  Yeah.  So Mommy went over Mommy's house.  You creep me out when you call your mom, Mommy.  She's my Mommy.  I think when you turn 12, you start calling her Mom. 
[00:02:00]  No, she's my...  My mother.  She's my Mommy.  You're 44 and you go, I'm going to my Mommy's for Mother's Day.  Mommy.  It's a little creepy.  Well, she's my Mommy.  I understand.  And we all went there, all the kids.  But not many adults say Mommy at your age.  That's true.  I think more so, though, than you think.  Really?  Yeah.  I've heard a lot of people call their mother, Mommy.  It's fun.  It's fun to call your mom, Mommy. 
[00:02:30]  What the hell is wrong with you?  It's kind of a goof, but what are you going to do?  Alright.  She knows, you know.  Because it's Mommy.  We went over there, all the kids, to sit through pregnant people.  All the kids?  You're all in your...  40 flurfs.  You're all 40 flurfs.  That's not kids anymore.  Well...  You're adults.  Apparently...  You're adults visiting mother.  When there's pregnant women walking around, I'm sitting there and I'm like, oh God, I'm the only one who can drink. 
[00:03:00]  Really?  When it's pregnant, he'll walk in preggers.  Maybe you should get pregnant, too.  No.  No.  Yes.  No.  Why not?  Two out of the three.  Make it a trifecta.  Then I forget, so I bring, you know, I bring over some Dom Perignon and some nice wine.  And then I realize that no one's going to drink it but me, and I wind up drinking too much. 
[00:03:30]  And then you can't drive 55?  Yeah.  Well, it finally happened.  I got a ticket.  Yeah, I got nailed last night driving home.  Well, last week we were talking about your, what, your supercar weekend.  Supercar weekend.  And you admitted that you may or may not have gotten a car up to about 180 over the weekend.  Yeah.  And now, a week later, you got a ticket. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, finally.  Finally got, yeah.  Finally got it.  Got pulled over last night driving home.  And, yeah.  I got 95 and a 55.  Oof.  Oof.  He hit me, too.  Got me for no front plate.  It's like, once you write someone up for 95 and a 55, perhaps you could just kind of look away from, I don't have a front plate on my car. 
[00:04:30]  Excuse me.  Now, where were you going?  I was going home.  From mommies.  Black cop, white cop?  No, the guy was writing the demo.  Wow.  Knew the show.  It was one of those, just didn't, nothing worked.  He didn't care.  What are you going to do?  He knew the show?  Yeah.  Then you pulled out every frigging thing I could try.  I just didn't want to.  You were wearing.  He was very courteous and everything.  It wasn't like he was, you know, an ass or anything.  He was very nice, but.  You were wearing the police uniform that the NYPD gave you, right? 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  I had my lights on the car and everything.  I was in a cruiser.  Man, he must have had a bad day then.  He must have.  Maybe his mommy's not around for Mother's Day and he had to take it out on you because, you know, most of us get PBA cards.  Wow, I had no idea what the NYPD hands out if they really like you.  Well, you know.  Oh, my God.  A little bit of everything.  I think you're part of the police force.  I am indeed.  I'm an officer.  Yeah.  A law officer.  He has Justin Volpe's plunger.  I just pull that out. 
[00:05:30]  Sniff the end.  Yeah.  I'm good.  You can let me go.  What did you say?  How did you say I'm from Opie and Anthony?  And he said, like, what did he say?  How embarrassing.  Well, that's why I don't.  That's why I never, like, pull that card because I can't.  I can't take rejection from a cop.  95 and a 55.  I'm going to try everything.  Everything.  I pulled that.  You know, I'm like, I got friends in the precinct.  I got my PBA cards and stuff.  And it didn't work.  And he said, where are you coming from?  And I told him, you know, I'm coming from my mother's house on Mother's Day. 
[00:06:00]  And he's like, well, you know, what are you going so fast for?  I was like, I got to get home.  I got to get to sleep.  I get up early for my show.  That's what I do.  So I kind of, you got to work it in.  You can't, you can't, like, as soon as the officer comes to your side window.  No, I am on a show.  I'm Anthony from Opie and Anthony.  I'm on a show.  You got to kind of casually work it in.  Like, hey, yes.  So it's like, yeah, Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, you're Anthony.  You know, like, yeah, yeah.  And you're like, nice.  I'm off the hook.  He goes, hold on a minute.  Goes back to the car. 
[00:06:30]  I'm just, and then I realized he was in the car too long.  You know, time's ticking.  I'm just sitting there going, oh, boy.  So he comes back and wrote me up.  But he didn't even get eaten nothing.  He didn't knock any of it off?  He didn't knock anything off.  Like I said, he wrote me up for the speed.  I think he added a mile or two.  I didn't have my insurance card with me.  I may have an old one.  I got the new one.  It's, you know, I'm insured.  Believe me.  So he wrote me up for uninsured.  And he wrote me up for no plate on the front. 
[00:07:00]  I'm not going to put a plate.  And I always said, I go, I'm not putting a plate on the front of the Shelby.  I'm just not going to do it.  So I'll eat that ticket.  I don't care.  I'll pay it.  But the Speedo is like, wow.  Don't you have to go to court for that?  Yeah.  That's a court one.  That's a few points and maybe jail time.  I don't know what that is.  That's not writing a check and sending it in the mail.  That's like.  That's a tough one, man.  You got to put your court suit on.  Could knock a few miles off. 
[00:07:30]  He didn't knock a thing off, man.  That's cool.  Not a thing.  He was just.  What can you get for a 95 and a 55?  I think you go to jail.  No.  You can't go to jail.  I think.  Reckless driving or something.  I think twice over speed limit is jail.  I don't know.  I think it's 25 over.  25 over.  25 over is bad.  You're not getting jail.  No.  For 80 miles an hour and a 55?  It's 95 and a 55.  I'm saying that's 25 over.  Yeah.  That's where jail starts?  I don't know.  Oh, you can lose your license, someone's saying, but I'm reading it off of, you know, the internets. 
[00:08:00]  The internets?  Yeah.  I don't think.  Well, that kind of put a damper on your old weekend, huh?  Well, it was the tail end of it.  So, what are you going to do?  Saturday, I did nothing.  I had a nothing Saturday, which is great.  It's about time you had a nothing.  You almost had a nothing weekend if it wasn't for this ticket, right?  I finally got out of bed when my hips hurt.  I was just like, ow.  I got to get out of bed.  I hurt.  Wait.  I was getting bed sores.  It was just time to leave the bed. 
[00:08:30]  Wait.  If you had a nothing Saturday, that means you had a something Friday.  Yeah.  Friday might have been a little rough.  Friday might have been a little raucous.  See, I didn't catch that when you were telling me in the office.  I'm thinking.  Eight points?  You get eight points on your license for a 95 and a 55?  It can be eight points.  I can't have eight points.  Eight points is four.  Danny, yes.  Well, 40 miles over the legal limit is eight points.  It's 40 or more is an immediate 11 points, and I think they revoke your license.  Get the...  Come on. 
[00:09:00]  That's the best.  It's going home.  I would...  It would be hilarious if you have to go to, like, driver's ed.  No, it's not hilarious.  With all the little 15-year-old girls, man.  All right.  I'll go.  I'll suck it up, and I'll go to the classes.  I think I need to be educated.  I would laugh my ass off if you have to get your license all over again with pimple-faced  kids.  You know what?  As much as that guy is a prick, I'm really grateful he did what he did. 
[00:09:30]  Shut up, Mr. Educate Me.  No, no, educate me.  We're trying to slow me down.  Keep the radio show going for me.  Yeah, listen to the signs.  They're all around you.  This one is a biggie.  You've got to, like, slow down just a little bit there, Anthony, in general.  Yeah.  You've got to be aware of the signs.  Let's say hi to...  Oh, look at that.  Now you're going to get all sorts of info here.  Bill on Long Island.  Bill.  Hey, what's happening?  Hey.  I just got a ticket on Saturday coming home from work. 
[00:10:00]  Maybe an 85 and a 55.  Now, I was just 30 miles an hour over the limit, so it's just you pay it, mail it in,  no court, no lose your license.  31 miles an hour over, that's when they can take your license away.  Damn it.  Guy knocked a few off mine.  You're at risk of losing your license, my friend.  For one speedo?  Yep.  Give me a break.  Thank you.  Steve from Bayshore writes, now we know what the 5-11 stands for on Ant's hat, the day  his ass finally got ticketed. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, yesterday it was 5-11?  You've been wearing the sign here for the last year.  Damn it.  It's been right on your hat.  I knew it had some significance.  You would think if you wore a 5-11 hat that on 5-11, you'd probably just stay home.  I should take it easy.  Yeah.  God damn.  I can't get...  I can't lose my license.  A lot of people say that it's eight points.  Let's say hi to Tim in Pennsylvania.  Tim, what's up?  Tim.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Tim.  Are you calling from real radio? 
[00:11:00]  Wow.  This is real audio, yeah.  I mean, real audio.  Real audio.  Version 1.0.  I had to yell out that line because I can't hear you, buddy.  What do you got, Tim?  Uh, every Monday...  Obviously, a sneaker phone.  I'm sorry.  Can you hit me better now?  Yeah, go ahead.  Or a football phone.  That's 0 for 2.  Why don't you start crashing me?  It would help me out here.  All right.  What do you got, Tim?  Every Monday, Anthony gets on, talk about how he's going in his excessive speed and how 
[00:11:30]  he gets away with...  I think the police are just going to probably stick to it.  And they probably have a...  I think what Tim's saying...  You're going to have to call from a better phone, Tim.  You're driving everyone nuts.  It's your own fault, Ant.  You asked for it.  That's what Tim's saying.  He's calling from the future.  Yeah.  Mike from Whitestone.  Mike?  Mike.  You know, Anthony...  Hey.  I listen to you talking about all your driving antics.  Yeah.  Antics.  Driving like a nut and everything.  95 miles an hour.  You know, God forbid you hit somebody. 
[00:12:00]  You killed the one.  I don't hit somebody.  I drive very nice at 95.  I'm a good driver when I speed.  Trust me.  You know, you think you're an IndyCar driver.  Yep.  No, I don't.  It's NASCAR.  IndyCar is silly on the highways.  It's more of a NASCAR thing.  Mike, you've got to get it right, too, because for Anthony going 95, he doesn't feel like  he's doing anything.  No, that feels like 55.  Last weekend, he was doing...  Oh, boy, Mike.  Last week, he was doing 180 on the highways.  Mike's mouth is doing 95. 
[00:12:30]  Let me tell you.  That's right, Mike.  You raise a good point.  He does not.  You know you just talked through everybody, right?  I'm sorry about that.  You plowed through.  We were sitting here trying to listen to you, and then when we tried to talk, at 95, you  plowed through us.  Okay.  Sorry about that.  But I mean, you know something, Anthony.  Yeah.  And the arrogance.  With all your cash...  Yep.  ...to even think about cash in a car...  I mean, you should be embarrassed to do something like... 
[00:13:00]  You shouldn't have those things in the first place.  What?  I would give you double the picture.  Why don't you go take your mother and lay her down and have sex with her?  And in the...  You know, I'd rather say it a different way, but have sex with your mother.  Anthony, Mike...  Go have sex with your mother, Mike.  Anthony, Mike's just telling the truth here.  What can I tell you?  He is not.  There's a bit of arrogance.  Mike's an ass.  There is no arrogance.  There's a bit of arrogance in your life these days.  I can't drive 55. 
[00:13:30]  You needed someone to maybe, maybe teach her a little bit of a lesson.  One foot on the brake and one of the guests hang.  I got the remedy for it, though.  I got the remedy for it.  Drive 100 into a wall.  Then you'll have no problem driving 55 anymore.  Well, Mike, that's not a good answer.  Wow.  You're going to have to deal with the phones.  I'm very surprised.  I don't like this guy.  Well, there's a whole bunch of...  They all now...  They're all coming out of the woodwork going, oh, good.  Good for you.  I thought you would have some sympathy this morning, but no.  They've been waiting for this day for a while.  Go screw.  Uh, Paul in Jersey, what's up? 
[00:14:00]  Hey, Ed.  Yeah.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  You had it coming your way, buddy.  You were pushing everybody's face how you were getting off the hook.  I wasn't pushing it.  I was reporting what was happening.  I wasn't pushing anything in anyone's face.  I was trying to drive home.  I don't want to hear you cry about it now then either, right?  Who's crying, you dick?  Who's crying?  So, wait, wait, are you saying that...  Hold on, dude.  Are you saying that because Anthony did kind of get away with it so many times?  It was just his turn, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, just look at Jimmy last week, boss. 
[00:14:30]  Mind before you.  You cursed out, you know, live on the air.  It was about time.  He was just looking out for you.  That's all, pal.  You're basically saying that Anthony's been a braggart lately, and it's about time he got  his.  Hey.  I'm with you there.  Hey.  Yeah, you got your...  Yeah, exactly.  Hey.  You know what happened, Ant?  What?  You've been bragging about going 180 miles an hour on the Long Island Expressway.  I wasn't bragging.  You know when that guy pulled you over last week, and you got two warnings.  Two different cops pulled you over last weekend.  You got two warnings.  A week later, you're getting a 95 and a 55. 
[00:15:00]  You don't think you were on there.  Master computer?  Let this guy off because he's part of the Opie and Anthony show, but let's watch this  guy closely.  Yes.  And a different car.  Yeah, but as soon as they probably popped your license into the system, and they probably  in the notes area, they're like, if you get...  We have to give the guy...  Write him up.  Finally.  Might have been.  You might be right.  State won't take away your license.  If he was a fan...  Well, here's Greg on Long Island.  Greg.  Greg. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  You said that the cop was a fan, right?  Well, I said he...  I wasn't sure if he was a fan.  He knew of the show, is all I'm saying.  Maybe he was siding with Jimmy and just tried to tell you to cut the shit.  Whoa!  Well, you know, you can put it in a different way.  You could actually say cut the crap.  Yeah.  Or cut the mingle.  Well, whatever you want to say.  But the thing is, you know, I think he could have knocked a couple of MPH off of the thing.  You know, it's a little... 
[00:16:00]  All right, let's go to Don the Trucker.  Don, what's up?  Hey, Don.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey, I was just kind of wondering, with all your gadgets and your gizmos and your guns  and your computers, why in the hell didn't you invest in the radar detector, pal?  I didn't go too fast for radar detectors.  I really do.  Really?  Yeah, it's good for a few miles an hour, Alva, but by the time I see it, I'm done.  I'm cooked.  You could actually go too fast for a radar detector?  I didn't even know that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I drive a truck, man.  I'm an outlaw trucker.  I've got one.  You wouldn't believe the technology with the radar detector. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I'll look into it.  Yeah.  Well, let me ask you a question with a radar detector.  You're probably the only guy around at that point, but even if you do here, can't you  slow down enough where he might not be sure exactly what car it is, if there's a bunch  of cars?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah, you have plenty of time, man.  There's plenty of time to slow down.  Jam on the brakes?  Yeah.  I think it was because I was kind of, I was getting around some traffic at the time,  you know?  I wasn't zigging and zagging like severe, but, you know, I was kind of, I right lane, and 
[00:17:00]  then slowly just ooze into the middle lane, and then the right lane again, and then over  to the left.  You're not slowly oozing to the middle lane.  I wasn't squeezing between cars, if that's what you mean.  I wasn't doing that.  You were zigging and zagging.  I wasn't zigging and zagging.  I was changing lanes, and I was using my directional.  Yeah.  I'm good like that.  A few bucks, good judge, you can get it reduced.  All right, Don.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, man.  I hope so.  He's like old school country, that guy.  Gotta work this out.  How many hits did Don have on the country charts back in the day? 
[00:17:30]  Fontaine, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, man.  Bert Comby.  Didn't you know you could sell it right there in Brainerd?  Yeah, you should have just said that.  Yeah, I should have said that.  You know, maybe we could take care of it right here in Brainerd.  You know, I was thinking maybe, you know, I want to be in compliance.  Right here in Smithtown.  Yeah, you know, I want to be in compliance, so maybe I was thinking we could take care  of it right here, you know, in Brainerd.  No.  Let's say good morning to Cleveland and say hi. 
[00:18:00]  Step out of the car, please, sir.  It's like a being compliant, that dumb look on his face.  Yeah, yeah.  I could be in compliance.  Well, and I didn't put my tags on.  Stupid Buscemi is great in there.  Let's say hi to Chuck.  Come on, man.  Chuck?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Chuck.  Yeah, Anthony, you said that cop didn't cut you any slack, but a little bit ago, you said  you'd been drinking too much.  You think maybe he cut you a whole bunch of slack?  Yeah, you did say.  Let me think about this.  Perhaps I was intoxicated, and he didn't give me a deewee. 
[00:18:30]  He just wrote me up for traffic.  No, I didn't leave drunk.  You did say you drank a lot, and your mom's, though.  You kind of said that.  Earlier in the afternoon when I was there.  We can't erase that from the record.  You personally said that right around 6-0-7.  Let me tell you what I do, though.  6-0-8.  I stop, and I drink club soda for hours before I leave.  Hours.  I was fine.  And you're a small gentleman.  It could not have dissipated yet.  Small guy?  I am. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  Great.  All right, let's go to Philly.  Brian in Philly, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I just wish there was a recorder device on the top to hear, Antonio, groveling.  Groveling?  Where's the sympathy for Anthony today?  There's none.  Everyone is finally just saying, we've had it with you.  Where's the sympathy?  We've had it.  This is everybody that gets tickets for doing anything wrong, and they've listened to me  going off every weekend.  Murder, basically. 
[00:19:30]  And they are now getting their day.  I'm Anthony from the Opie and Anthony show.  I have a PBA card.  But I know Keith, and he starts doing voices.  Well, maybe.  Well, let's not write me up.  How fast are you going?  I don't remember.  Yes.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  You don't have to give me a ticket.  Limited tickets.  Angry, Vince.  How important is the pen in writing a ticket?  You're fired. 
[00:20:00]  There's no reason to write me up, officer.  No reason.  You know what?  You think I'm going to pay this ticket?  There's no chance in here.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  I don't have to pay tickets.  Do you know who I am?  Hey, checkies.  Didn't work.  Nothing worked, huh?  Nothing.  Steve.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Listen, Anthony. 
[00:20:30]  New York State has a driver responsibility fee.  Not only are you going to get bagged for the fine, they're also going to bag you for going  a certain number on a point over a limit on your license.  So, not only do you have to pay the fine, you've got to pay the state for the privilege of keeping  your license for every, I think it's $150 every point over four or five.  Look, I don't care about paying.  I don't want points on my license. 
[00:21:00]  But, Anthony, they're taking money from you twice.  I don't like your ex-wife.  I don't want to do that.  They're taking money twice, dude.  Yeah.  I've got to slow down.  I just got to slow down.  I'm a chronic speeder also, so I know it's bad.  All right, Steve.  Thank you so much.  More phone calls standing by.  Everybody wants in on the fact that Anthony got nailed going 95 in a 55.  His PBA cards, his police uniform, his placards, his special license plates.  Nothing worked. 
[00:21:30]  Nothing worked this time around.  And the guy was a fan of the show.  He cared less.  Well, he knew the show, yeah.  I think it's because of all the bragging you've been doing on the air.  I'm not bragging.  But for these people that are happy today, Anthony's giving you great radio.  by talking about the fact that they're before the grace of God, you.  Those that live in glass houses, you.  That's right.  He didn't have to admit that he went 180 last weekend.  He got pulled over twice with warnings. 
[00:22:00]  I was just, people asked how was Supercar Weekend.  So I told them.  I gave them a whole story.  I wasn't bragging.  It's part of my job.  I have a radio show.  I talk about what I do.  And I whine now.  I think some of the law enforcement officers out there took note, though.  Yeah.  And said, look, we've got to be watching for this guy.  Damn it.  We pull him over again.  We've got to give him a ticket this time around.  All right, look.  Don't pull me over anymore.  That's all I'm asking you.  How about you slow down a little bit?  No, no, no, no, no.  Here's the deal. 
[00:22:30]  Don't pull me over anymore.  And then you don't have to give me a ticket.  All right.  What?  You don't like that?  You're insane.  I was trying.  It is kind of silly.  Did you at least shoot your guns this weekend?  A little bit, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I went to the range.  That made you happy?  I love shooting.  All right, good.  It's a lot of fun.  Just getting started.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  The phones are lit.  They want to talk about Anthony's speeding ticket.  We've got a lot to do.  Oh, yeah.  As we start another fun week of radio.  Give me my clarity and this stupid pollen. 
[00:23:00]  Coming up on the O.B. and Anthony Show, we're going to discuss cuddle parties.  I guess it's all the rage here in New York City.  Cuddle party.  Yuck.  Cuddle party, huh?  And that's all it is, too, by the way.  Cuddle parties.  Because you would think, hey, hey, wait a minute.  Maybe it starts with some cuddling.  Yeah, and then what happens?  And then it's an all-out orgy.  No, it's just a bunch of people, a bunch of adults cuddling.  But is it like group cuddling or individual cuddling? 
[00:23:30]  It's like one of those stupid HBO real sex segments where they all just get together,  touch each other, and go, oh.  Yeah, they set up cuddle parties.  Old grandpas.  You show up at someone's apartment, and you cuddle with strangers.  And it doesn't lead to sex.  Silly.  Ridiculous, right?  So you're just, like, holding somebody you don't know or give a crap about? 
[00:24:00]  If you want to do it now, we can.  Phone number 877-212-018.  No, Jimmy, come here.  No, no, no.  I bet you read the story.  My God.  Are we done with your speeding ticket?  Yeah.  For now?  There's nothing much else.  Anthony got nailed for a 95 and a 55.  So how fast was Ant really going?  He's saying about 95.  I was saying 95.  I wasn't really.  I didn't jam on the brake when that happened.  I was pretty much just driving.  Yeah, the cop came out of nowhere.  It wasn't like Anthony was going 120, saw the cop, and was able to slow it down to 95 
[00:24:30]  before the cop, you know, got him.  Up here, it's a $10,000 fine going that fast.  That's Georgia, Ontario, Canada.  Oh, Canada.  I hear you.  Stupid Canada.  You're a little crazy up there in Canada.  Let's say hi to Mike from the NYPD.  Mike, what's up?  Mike?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Mikey.  I just want to let you know, I'm a big fan of the show, and I think after you would  have told me that you were part of the show, I probably would have let you have gone out  and got a ticket.  Thanks, Mike.  Or knock it down if you were right.  Wish that would have been you. 
[00:25:00]  Nah, not really.  I rarely write anybody tickets.  As I pull them over, I just mess with them.  I'm not going to get arrested, and now I'm like, yeah, I'm just playing.  Let them go.  I'd imagine you guys just don't want to write those tickets.  They're a pain in the neck.  They're really long.  Huh?  It's a language.  Sometimes I run out of ink and everything.  Yeah.  I just think the front plate thing is a little, like I can even understand, look, if I was  speeding, whatever, the guy writes me up.  But then to give me that no front plate thing on top of that, that's like, that's something 
[00:25:30]  you give somebody when you don't write them up for something.  You go, all right, look, I'm not going to write you up for a broken headlight, but I'm  going to give you this for, you know, that, or you were a little speeding over the limit,  so I'll just write you up for no front plate or, you know, whatever, an equipment violation.  To give me that is like, on top of the Speedo, it was a little meh.  You know what's going to happen because of this?  Because of your irresponsibility?  Yes, what?  Keith, the cop's going to have to, like, quit his job so he can drive you in every day. 
[00:26:00]  Full time.  He's going to have to drive you full time.  Be my driver.  You're lucky they didn't tow your car right there.  This is Manny in Arizona.  Manny.  Manny.  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Good to finally hear you guys.  It's freaking three in the morning right now.  Anyway, Anthony, here in Tuxent, if you don't have proof of insurance, you're at, they'll  tow your car away on the spot.  I have insurance.  My insurance card was expired.  I have the new one. 
[00:26:30]  It wasn't put in the car.  Yeah.  Actually, it was in the car, by the way, but it was on the floorboard.  I think another time I was pulled over, when I took it out, it kind of fell under the  seat.  So, I actually did have insurance.  I've got to acknowledge something.  The radio station we're on in Arizona decided that we need to be on in the middle of the  night.  They took away a really nice time slot from us.  And every morning, we got a lot of people calling from Arizona that are listening to  the show live still.  They said, all right, I'll just set my alarm to listen to these guys. 
[00:27:00]  It's kind of flattering.  I just want to acknowledge that today.  Tommy in Arizona, what's going on?  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, what's up, man?  Anthony.  Hey.  Pretty soon, it's going to be, hit him and take me by the park.  He's smart-ass.  All right.  Well, it's heading that way.  I was going to say slowly heading that way, but who are we kidding?  Did that guy say Tuxin, Arizona?  Yeah, maybe that's the cool thing to do out there. 
[00:27:30]  What?  I know it's Tucson, but I think-  Tucson.  Why would he say Tuxin?  I didn't question it, because I'm thinking maybe that's like a local thing.  Is that what you say, man?  Tuxin?  You say Tuxin if you're really from here, and if you're cool.  Jojo left his home in Tuxin, Arizona.  It doesn't quite flow.  You get big laughs, though, when you enunciate wrong, like when you sound out like things.  I was in a restaurant.  I ordered philette mignan.  Stop it.  It fell out.  Stop it.  And if you would have had your sunglasses on upside down on your face, they would have 
[00:28:00]  fallen down just wetting themselves.  Every time the waiter walked by.  Philette mignan.  Ah, philette mignan.  All right.  You want to hear about cuddle parties or what?  This is coming out of Philadelphia.  Look inside local cuddle parties.  Cuddle parties.  And today's nonstop rush to get here and there, maneuvering through a crowd of hundreds and  in and out of lines of traffic.  Some people worry that they're losing touch with each other.  Yeah.  Now there's a way to really reach out and touch somebody else.  You could do it at a cuddle party. 
[00:28:30]  You know, where are these things happening?  Because you only read about them.  I read.  You never hear about these goddamn things anyway.  Have you heard?  Has anyone invited you to one?  Do you know where one is being held?  I read about a cuddle party happening in New York, I believe, either in a magazine or somewhere.  I read about cuddle parties here in New York as well.  This is an invite?  It costs 10 bucks?  All right.  Hold on.  Before we get to the invite, we found an invite to a cuddle party.  We should have our listeners go to this one.  Oh, big, fat, smelly people. 
[00:29:00]  This is what a cuddle party is all about.  It may look like a pajama party for grown-ups.  Oh, cute.  It's fun, but there are rules.  The number one rule, ready, at the cuddle party?  Number one rule.  Jimmy, what's the number one rule at the cuddle party?  Yeah.  Let me think.  No clear stuff.  Wear PJs with the backs that open.  An older gentleman wants to cuddle with you.  Pajamas stay on the whole time.  Yeah.  And this is what confuses the hell out of me. 
[00:29:30]  It says, this is a non-sexual event.  How can you have a cuddle party and it's a non-sexual event?  Let me tell you something.  If you're rubbing up, if you're like cuddling up to some hot 22-year-old NYU student who decides  to go to the cuddle party and she's in her like nice PJs and you're lucky enough to cuddle  up next to you, you're supposed to like...  If you're spooning with her, I don't care if your PJs are on, off, or thick flannel, you  are going to start pushing your hips. 
[00:30:00]  Oh my God, are you?  You're going to start the hip push.  You think they go, what are you doing?  It's called a dry hump party.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  This is non-sexual.  Come on.  This is a bad...  They should call this, are you too unattractive to be touched for free?  Well, if so, we'll pretend to love you for $55 at the door.  Do you know how many fat, ugly people are showing up for this?  Oh, it's going to be disgusting.  What hot chicks giving up a Friday to go cuddle with older men?  Cuddle with me. 
[00:30:30]  But how can it be a non-sexual...  Bikini bowling.  Hey there.  Where is that happening?  Oh, the news.  It's the news.  Look at this.  There's a war!  Dude, look how hot this is.  Stop it.  It's really hot.  Holy Jesus.  It's premiering today.  That's right.  On Howard TV.  Oh, Jesus.  Well, he's got a great idea.  I got to tell you.  You got to give it to Howie.  Bikini bowling.  Howie's doing, you know.  Hey, God bless. 
[00:31:00]  This is some hot...  That blonde is really hot.  Ridiculous.  It's Channel 11 News.  It's that dummy.  What's his name?  Larry.  Yeah.  And Larry just bowled a strike.  Larry.  I guess he really doesn't really give a crap about bikinis.  He just focused on the pins and threw a strike.  That will all be one happy family soon.  All right.  Well...  Wow.  That blonde is really ridiculous.  Yeah, but is she a good bowler?  Yeah.  Can she bowl?  Is she going to be over the foul line?  Bikini bowling.  God bless Howie for that one. 
[00:31:30]  All right.  Chalk one up for Howie.  He got my attention there.  Two subscribers.  We just turned up the audio on you here.  Howie TV.  All right.  Oops.  I didn't know where that came from, but it definitely got my attention.  We show videos with Big A.  Yeah, I know.  We're talking about cuddle parties with fat men.  Yeah.  Great.  And we do stuff with the homeless.  Damn it.  We do stuff with the homeless.  He's doing stuff with bikini broads.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're smart.  All right.  Anyway, this cuddle party, it's non-sexual.  Okay.  Now that we have that out of the way, you may ask yourself, what's a cuddle party? 
[00:32:00]  This is a way of framing touch in a positive way, says cuddle party facilitator.  Edie Weinstein.  Edie Weinstein.  What a sexy name.  Weinstein.  Wow.  Weinstein, what's the line across, like, dash, Moser.  Oh, she's got a hyphen.  Edie says the parties, which are held around the country and in our area are-  Hyphens are empowering. 
[00:32:30]  Are meant to help people achieve better intimacy and communication, and it allows people to express  themselves in a comfortable and safe environment.  They're snuggling, nuzzling, and even spooning, and this is non-sexual?  When's the next one?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We gotta go.  No, no, we don't.  Big A has to go.  Big A.  Yeah, Big A.  We're sending Big A to the cuddle party?  Come on.  Let's do that.  Yeah, absolutely.  We got info on the next cuddle party.  We'll get back in a second here.  Could you imagine him nuzzling someone with his hot mothball breath? 
[00:33:00]  Oh, with that rule.  Oh, man.  We all, like, when we were growing up, you know, and if you're at a party and there's, like,  couches and places to sleep, you're cuddling up to the hottest girl in the room hoping you're  going to get some action.  You're not just sitting there cuddling.  No.  Oh, my God.  We should all take a Cialis and go to the cuddle party. 
[00:33:30]  Hopefully get up right behind Edie Weinstein.  Come here, you.  I'm going to cuddle with you.  Can we please put this information up somewhere?  Oh, yes.  It's on Friday.  I'm not going to give the day, but Friday.  Yeah, we'll get that.  We've got to get through the rest of this.  And we'll put it up on onaradio.com.  It's 2.30 to 6 p.m.  Yeah.  Well, they don't want it at night when you could possibly be drunk and on drugs and stuff.  Our listeners could go to that.  Edie says the parties which are held around the country.  Okay, so you've got the, it allows people to express themselves in a comfortable and 
[00:34:00]  safe environment.  Okay, they're snuggling, nuzzling, and even spooning.  But not everyone's ready for a group hug right away since you may not know everyone.  So to get comfortable, there are a few steps to start with.  At the cuddle party.  The first step, whether you're with a partner or by yourself, is to sit and chat in a welcome  circle.  Yeah.  A welcome circle.  You want to join our welcome circle?  May I sit in your welcome circle?  Is there a cracker in the middle?  I like a nice welcome circle myself.  Guys, do you mind if I join your welcome circle? 
[00:34:30]  A welcome circle.  Yuck.  That sounds awful.  Welcome circle.  You hear the rules?  Welcome circle.  I'm Andrew.  Yeah, sit down.  Oh, and they're all just like, oh no, is he going to be cuddling?  Who's he cuddling with?  You watch how fast one of them has to get up and go to the bathroom.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to leave the welcome circle for a moment. 
[00:35:00]  We'll get a picture of Big A on ONAradio.com for the people that don't know who Big A is.  And then it'll make this one a lot funnier to have him at a cuddle party.  He's going to be alone as the welcome dot.  Yeah.  It's not even the circle.  He's just the welcome spot.  No one's going to be around him.  So first you ask permission to join the welcome circle.  Okay.  May I?  And then when you join the welcome circle, you hear the rules, which include asking permission  and getting a verbal yes before you touch anybody.  Uh-oh.  And if everyone agrees to all of the rules, the cuddling begins. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, baby.  Come on.  And then you got some quotes here.  I love experiencing the feelings that come up when you connect with each individual person.  Said cuddle party goer Linda Hunter.  Day-to-day life could get isolated, so it's nice to have something to break out of that pattern.  You know what?  Got a lot of guys, obviously, listening to this show.  Why don't you tell your wife or girlfriend that Friday at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, 2.30 in the afternoon,  you're going to a cuddle party. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And tell her it's non-sexual and see what happens.  Yeah, you're just going to cuddle.  Yeah, okay.  And see what would happen if she said she was going.  Yeah.  And, you know, you just say, I'm going to a cuddle party.  What?  Oh, guys are just going to be, like, fondling you?  This is a recipe for sex.  This is a fondle party.  Of course it is.  You don't think you're going to get a number or something?  You don't think, like, the girl might just back up just a little bit?  Pull a little pant leg aside?  I mean, we're all talking about the guys and what we're able to do with our hips. 
[00:36:30]  I just showed up in my boy shorts.  Right.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh, they said it was non-sexual, so I figured I could wear this.  This is what I wear to bed.  Okay.  All right.  Little teddy and boy shorts.  And she lays down, and you're spooning with her, and it's not sexual.  You mind if I cuddle with you?  Not at all.  And then you just lay down and just, shwo-boom, shwok.  You're just, like, like a pillar, like a granite pillar. 
[00:37:00]  Come on.  Yeah.  I bet you hookers show up to this thing.  It's a smart place to go.  It probably would be, because then there's cuddling going on.  It's like, hey, you want to do a little more than this?  You're up by six.  Yeah.  And how many people are, like, doing a little whispering, like, look, look, I'm here not  for the cuddling.  What about you?  Forget this.  Oh, my God.  I was thinking the same thing.  Forget this cuddle party stuff.  Where do you live?  You want to really cuddle?  I'll show you some real cuddling.  How about we do some inner cuddling? 
[00:37:30]  Nude cuddle party.  Right.  All right?  This is just the start.  Dude, we should do our own cuddle party.  Here in the studio?  That'd be hilarious.  People in their PJs show up and just cuddle, and they don't even know each other.  That'll be it.  Perfect strangers will get them all in here to cuddle.  If we did a cuddle party, how many people would show up before work?  That's what I got to ask.  You got to show up with some PJs and just lay around the floor.  A bunch of dudes laying around in their pajamas.  What girl is going to come to a cuddle party? 
[00:38:00]  A bunch of dudes and one fat chick.  For Eric Hunter, I have finally completely overcome my social anxiety that I had for decades.  Linda Hunter?  Wasn't she there, too?  Wait, was she there?  Yeah, what are they?  Brother and sister?  Hold on.  That's hot.  What are we going to do?  Oh, wow.  It looks like the hunters are into swinging.  Swingers.  Of course.  Cuddle parties last for about three hours.  Three hours of cuddling?  Please.  That is torture.  I could see maybe cuddling for a couple minutes and going, all right, I got to leave. 
[00:38:30]  You're going to be throwing those underwear away.  If this is non-sexual, I could maybe last three minutes.  Get about it.  Cuddle parties last for about three hours.  It looks like rubber cement was spilled.  Oh, and stuffed animals are optional.  Oh, that's adorable.  So we can be sure the plushies are going to show up then.  You know, the plushies that like having sex with stuffed animals?  Hi, we're the plushies.  We're plushies.  And we're here for the cuddle party.  Hi, we're the plushies.  Can we join your welcome circle?  Yeah.  Oh, you brought stuffed animals. 
[00:39:00]  How cute.  Well, we're actually wearing our stuffed animals.  Oh, that one's got a hole in it.  Why don't you sew that up?  Yeah.  We figured we'd wear our plushies.  Yeah, I see you wearing that.  How could you hold the plushie in your lap without your hands?  It just seems to be staying there.  You invite the plushies.  The plushies.  I like that they're now called just the plushies.  Plushies.  It's like a gang.  Hi, we're the plushies.  Can we join your cuddle party?  Yeah, come on.  These folks enjoy themselves, and they tell me they leave feeling lighter emotionally 
[00:39:30]  and physically.  Oh.  Really?  You can't help but smile being around this.  And who doesn't love a good hug once in a while?  Yeah.  Three hours with strangers.  This is creepy.  There's something else going on here.  There's 12 rules.  Some of these rules are wonderful.  What are the rules?  I love the rules.  You started reading them before, but keep the pajamas down the whole time.  Oh, right.  Well, actually, yeah, but what to wear, Jimmy?  Pajamas.  Nothing too risque.  Okay, so there goes the boy shorts and the lingerie.  Think more comfy than sexy.  More drawstrings, less lace. 
[00:40:00]  No shorts.  What to bring?  A pillow or stuffed animal, if you like.  Juice or sparkling cider is always welcome.  This is so great.  Sorry, no liquor, folks.  Otherwise, just bring your smiling self.  All right, we're going to have a cuddle party.  We're going to have booze.  We're going to have lacy.  We're going to have boy shorts.  We're going to have teddies.  I love this one.  Dude, you know we have our channel that's live on Saturday nights? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  We got to just broadcast.  Cuddle party.  We got to broadcast a cuddle party.  Put it on the calendar, Danny.  The first Opie and Anthony cuddle party going down.  Cuddle party.  On Saturday night in the near future.  Come get the cuddle caddy.  What's that?  Or me.  I guess that's who I was writing the rules.  If there's a concern, problem, or you should feel unsafe, or need assistance with anything,  you got to grab a cuddle caddy.  Excuse me, cuddle caddy?  Cuddle caddy.  Yeah, this guy's trying to f*** me in my f***.  Could you help me out here, cuddle caddy? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  No, he's trying to put his f*** right in my f***.  Could you please help me, cuddle caddy?  Can you use the beep?  Yes.  Cuddle caddy?  This plushie has a raging f***, and all I want is a hug.  I was just looking for a hug, cuddle caddy?  Right.  School's not important.  Winning that cuddle caddy tournament.  Now that's important.  Okay, Pookie.  The cuddle caddy.  Cuddle caddy?  Can you kick out the plushies? 
[00:41:30]  They're creeping everybody out.  Need the cuddle caddy.  The cuddle caddy.  Pillar of Stuffed Animal, if you like juice.  Yeah, we did all that.  Okay.  Something as legal as a cuddle caddy.  Sorry, folks.  No liquor.  No liquor.  Stop, old drunk.  I'm thinking Wally World.  Sorry.  This guy stinks of booze, and he's got a raging f***, and he's trying to f*** my wife.  Otherwise, just bring your smiling self.  Okay, the rules.  Pajamas stay on the whole time.  You don't have to cuddle anyone at a cuddle party ever. 
[00:42:00]  You must ask permission and receive a verbal yes.  We did that, of course.  If you're a yes to a request, say yes.  If you're a no, say no.  If you're a maybe, say no.  You're encouraged to change your mind.  Respect your relationship boundaries and communicate with your partner.  Respect your relationship boundaries, okay?  All right.  Rule number nine.  That's great.  All right.  The cuddle caddy really creeped me out, and the pajamas staying on the whole time not creeping  me out.  But number nine is the creepiest rule ever. 
[00:42:30]  I love number nine.  Tears and laughter are both welcome.  Imagine you're just a creep.  That's the hug I never got from my mommy.  You just go to the cuddle party thinking maybe you'll get laid or something.  Right.  You know, you're cuddling up.  You find a girl, so you start cuddling with her.  Right.  And everything's going smooth.  And then you feel a hand reach around you and start hugging you.  And you turn around to, my daddy never hugged me. 
[00:43:00]  Just crying.  I just come to cuddle.  Don't mind my tears.  They're welcome.  Did you ever hear of Fowdry?  You know the song Pendulum?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Creepy.  Exactly.  All like meatloaf in Fight Club.  You're trying to cuddle with the hottest broad in the room, and there's some dude in the  corner just crying his eyes out as he's in his adult PJs. 
[00:43:30]  You know, I never got hugs like this.  I'm hugging you.  Would you hug me?  Meanwhile, you're trying to, you know, make time with some, trying to make time with just  some broad over here.  You're getting C-blocked by some guy.  By some weeping gentleman.  Who would go to a cuddle party?  I'm thinking, bang this broad here, Hendry.  I'm thinking, I'm thinking. 
[00:44:00]  Probably a lot of, you think a lot of.  I cuddle with their poodles.  I cuddle with their poodles.  I'm thinking fat broads, and I'm thinking anyone that has some kind of issue with their  sexuality.  Like Streisand.  Whether it was, well, whether it was they were touched as a kid, there's something going  on with their sexuality that you need to, like, I don't know.  Some things have to be sorted out.  Tears and laughter are both welcome.  Yeah.  Respect people's privacy when sharing about cuddle parties and do not gossip.  The other side of that is pretty good, though. 
[00:44:30]  Laughter.  Could you just imagine doing this maniacal laugh like De Niro in Cape Fear?  Just cuddling someone and doing this.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  I'm thinking more of that creepy laugh.  That would be cool.  That's in your ear.  That's how everyone reacts when the fat girl walks in. 
[00:45:00]  All right.  I'm going to rest and join the welcome circle.  You are a welcome circle.  I'm going to run down our laughs with this work at a cuddle party.  I don't think you're getting many cuddles with that laugh.  No.  Laughter is encouraged as our tears, but not like that.  No.  Can you imagine somebody creeping up behind you?  But it's like one of those laughs that's going to turn to tears at any moment. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm so happy.  I'm just crying.  We have to spoil the cuddle party.  We have to ruin it.  Absolutely.  We're getting there.  I want to wreck this thing.  This one's creepy, too.  Respect people's privacy when sharing about cuddle parties and do not gossip.  Gossip?  Yeah, about the...  Did you hear what happened three people back?  Did you see that creep?  He's crying as he was cuddling.  It's got bad hiney smell. 
[00:46:00]  Bad hiney smell.  Just rubbing it on you.  Yeah, what other...  In front of your jammy stink.  Yeah, what other gossip...  Like a hard day's work.  What other gossip would you have?  That's all you could possibly have.  What about the dude at the cuddle party that was wearing the Hannah Montana PJs?  Yeah, what's going on there?  It's trying to cuddle with a young girl.  All right, we've got to get Big A to go to the cuddle party.  Yeah, I want to wreck this thing.  That's why I don't know if we should give out the info.  Why?  Because I don't want them to be on to us. 
[00:46:30]  I want Big A to just, like, you know, go to this thing.  What do you think?  I think if we give it out for the first...  Honestly, maybe four listeners will show up.  But if we really work this behind the scenes, we could get Big A or somebody else to go.  And then we could get a...  What's up?  Oh, well, if you notice on the sheet, those are actually two different cuddle parties.  Oh.  Okay, so we can give one out and keep the other...  Why are there two cuddle parties?  I've never heard of these.  I can't have enough cuddle parties.  Wow. 
[00:47:00]  We've got to lie.  Oh, God, the Big A picture Iraq just put up is really, really creepy.  That's him without the eyebrows.  Yeah.  Need some love?  Have some love to give?  Come join fellow New Yorkers in a cuddle party event.  I told you, this is happening in every city.  Bring a pillow and your cuddly self in PJs and have some relaxing time with cuddle bugs like yourself.  Cuddle bugs?  Ew.  Ugh.  What about cuddle roaches?  $55 at the door.  Where are these held? 
[00:47:30]  Like, I just picture out of the street.  I would imagine in someone's apartment.  Is it like an apartment?  Is it a club?  I imagine someone's...  A warehouse where they used to have raves?  She'd be in an incinerator.  Cuddle party.  You may be kept together in the cuddle party.  Cuddle party video just came up on Instagram.  No way.  Get that up immediately and get it up on onaradio.com later this afternoon.  And then there's another one, Memorial...  Bring your pillow so you'll have something to hump after the first ten minutes. 
[00:48:00]  That's from Sean the producer.  That's funny.  You know what, though?  Cuddle bug.  Or bring your pillow in case an old lady shows up and gets warm.  Hello, I'm the angel of death.  Leave her bent nose laying there while everyone else gets up to leave.  Your pillowcase has this bad makeup version of the Shroud of Turin printed on it.  Blue eyeshadow and rouge. 
[00:48:30]  They don't realize she's dead until they all leave and they come back and it's like, Edna, Edna.  She really liked to cuddle.  She's taking a little nap.  Yeah.  You know why you're so caught up in the cuddling?  How about this?  You get a little ecstasy and go to a cuddle party?  Oh, yeah?  You're thinking?  Every touch would be...  No drugs.  No drugs.  Yeah, they don't know what you drop before you...  Yeah.  Did I just say drop?  That's good.  Like it's the 60s?  Look at you.  The dropping acid.  Ugh.  Betty's, Dexy's, meth.  Sure.  Well, cuddle parties is all the rage. 
[00:49:00]  Let's talk about cuddle parties for the rest of the show.  I want to go.  Well, we got to have our own version of one.  Yeah, we'll do one here.  Put it on Pal Talk and do the whole thing, man.  A cuddle party.  Okay.  We're doing a cuddle party.  Is that a video?  Is there a video of a cuddle party?  Oh, wow.  Let's see what the hell that's about.  It's the Reginald Denny video.  He's cuddling up with a planting.  Cuddling up with a fist and a toilet.  And a toilet. 
[00:49:30]  Here, cuddle up with a cinder block, dummy.  Look at the lovely Philadelphia police officers at the cuddle party with those gentlemen in the street.  You should have cuddled with your gas pedal, idiot.  Guy's a moron.  All right.  Here's the cuddle party video.  We'll get this up on onaradio.com.  It's the anchorwoman babbling.  Can we get the audio of this, maybe?  All right.  We're going to have audio from this news piece on a cuddle party. 
[00:50:00]  Oh, cuddle party.  Well, look at this thing.  What is the...  Oh, boy.  Why is Reverend Al Sharpton at the cuddle party?  Allow that.  That'll ruin everything.  All right.  They're showing a room full of adults, and I don't see one good-looking girl in the bunch.  I see guys.  Yeah.  Where are the girls?  Of course guys are going to go to this.  That looks like he's...  All right.  Are those girls?  I can't tell.  And it looks like...  Where is that being held?  It's like a gymnasium or something.  Yeah, it looks like it's some kind of youth center. 
[00:50:30]  And there's the lady in charge.  And our new youth are in center.  I'm sorry you can't come.  Oh, my God.  Look at that guy.  He's still being something.  It's a guy?  On the left?  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Jesus Christ.  I can't tell.  What freaks?  All right.  We're going to get some audio of this after the break.  All right?  I want to hear about it.  877-212-ONA.  It's all about cuddle party.  That's that Greg Packer dude.  He went to a cuddle party.  Get him on the phone.  Who is that?  It's like Ted Levine.  No, not that guy.  Go back.  I've told you about Greg Packer. 
[00:51:00]  He goes to everything.  He's like...  His whole gig in life is right there.  Pause.  That guy.  Phil Packer?  He hangs out at FH Riley's, too.  My brother's joined in Huntington Village.  No way.  400-year cabinet.  Right there.  And he's in the cuddle party story?  You know who that is.  Is he a pest?  He is a professional pest.  What he does is he tries to get on TV as much as humanly possible.  Oh, okay.  So let's say the Yankees are selling playoff tickets.  He makes sure he's first in line, so the news crews have to freaking...  They talk to him.  ...talk to him.  When the iPhone came out, he was first in line. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, all right.  I remember that guy then.  I remember the iPhone.  This is his whole gig.  He's got video of himself eating at McDonald's with Clinton back in the day.  He's a professional, like, try-to-get-on-TV guy.  And then he's cuddle party now.  Now, look.  He went to a cuddle party.  Jesus.  I think we got his phone number.  We should get him on the show.  He listens every morning.  Greg, if you're listening, give us a call.  I want to know about this cuddle party thing you went to.  And we'll get the audio from this news piece after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Nice. 
[00:52:00]  I think they named a spider after Neil Young over the weekend or something like that.  They found some spider and needed a name, and they named it Neil Young, I think.  I caught a glimpse of that in the paper this morning.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Iron Man, number one at the box office.  Some people care about this stuff, so we just throw it out there.  Speed Racer was a complete bomb.  Only made $20 million.  Well, they were expecting a lot more money for Speed Racer, right?  Yes.  Jenna Bush got married on Saturday. 
[00:52:30]  It's got to be a weird situation.  Mother's Day.  The guy that marries the president's daughter.  Yeah, and then she's got to lose the good name, man.  I mean, a lot of people don't like the...  Chill hyphenate.  A lot of people don't like George Bush, but, you know, if you're Jenna Bush, you're named  after a president.  You don't want to lose your last name.  Hyphenate.  Like the cuddle party woman.  Cuddle party lesbian.  Wait till you hear about Rule 7.  Watch Rule 7. 
[00:53:00]  Watch out for Rule 7.  We're getting all our cuddle party info together, and we'll have more on the cuddle party later  on this morning.  And not just, by the way, not just Big A, but we've got to get, like, Pat from Monocity  to go.  Yep.  Oh, we've got to get a few different.  Patty.  Patty would be perfect.  Oh, would she not shut up either?  Oh, don't touch me there.  She'd be so shy with anyone touching her.  This could turn into something else.  Let's get tippy-topped, too.  Tippy-topped.  I'm here for the cuddle party.  I want a cuddle. 
[00:53:30]  Who's cuddling with me?  I want a cuddle party.  All right, our dream team.  I paid my money, and I want cuddle.  Our dream team for the cuddle party is Big A.  Dream team.  Pat from Monocity.  Stark and Patty, you've made the dream team for the cuddle party.  And, uh...  About Twitchels.  And Twitch...  I'll lay in there just twitching and grunting.  This back...  Sandy Cain, people are saying... 
[00:54:00]  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, come on, man.  Twitchels breaking Rule 7 all night long.  Oh, constantly.  With men.  See, you've got to laugh at her, but you've got to know what Rule 7 is.  We'll tell you what Rule 7 is in a little bit.  Uh, speaking of Sandy Cain, this might be worth playing.  I don't know.  I think the video and the visual is much better.  But on Friday's show, Sandy Cain came in.  She's, um...  She's an old burlesque dancer.  She still works the peep shows, I guess.  She has a public access show here in Manhattan on Saturday nights. 
[00:54:30]  Simply horrid.  She gets really mad when we talk about her age, but it's safe to say she's in her 60s, right?  Yeah.  Early 60s and still wears, uh, basically nothing when she comes and sees us and she gets naked  and it's just horrific.  She should have white, uh, she should have striped socks that curl up under a house.  That's what she looks like.  I'm lost.  At Wizard of Oz.  Oh, God.  Of course. 
[00:55:00]  They just curl up.  Of course.  Of course.  Leave it to me with a nice homosexual reference like the Wizard of Oz.  You know?  Yeah.  It's accurate.  Well, she looks like she's just melting.  And her new gimmick is to be the, uh, the Times Square cowgirl.  She wants to be the naked cowgirl.  They have the naked cowboy that dresses in red, white, and blue.  And a cowboy hat, a guitar, and sings.  And, uh, people, tourists from all over take pictures with him.  That's what we have here in New York.  Whoopity doo.  We had him on the show once. 
[00:55:30]  He's a nice enough guy, but we're like, ugh.  Borefest.  He's a tool.  He really is a tool.  He pretty much, uh, sings in Times Square in tighty-whities and just, like, cowboy boots  and a cowboy hat.  Yeah.  And the fat, fat, freaking tourists from all over the world just eat him up for some reason.  He makes a bloody fortune.  Let's take a picture with the naked cowboy.  Oh, my God.  Look, we're in Times Square.  The naked cowboy.  Now, let me just take video of, uh, TGI Fridays.  I'm going to show this to everyone when I get back to wherever the hell I come from. 
[00:56:00]  Des Moines.  Des Moines.  You ever see people, you're trying to just cross the street, get from point A to point  B, and they're videotaping something that you're just looking at going, who's going to watch  this?  Like a Marriott.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Look.  Oh.  Get out of here.  Sandy's had the little kids go, oh, look, the naked crib keeper.  So she's going to be the naked cowgirl.  She's already doing it.  And she came in to kind of perform one of her songs for everybody.  And we had a live studio audience on Friday.  And, uh, let's, let's just play the audio and see how it goes. 
[00:56:30]  Okay.  It's, it's about a minute.  This is Sandy Cain from Friday's show.  I used to live in Nashville, Tennessee.  But I'm originally from New York, New Jersey.  New Jersey, and you know what?  I also lived in Miami with a hay.  Are you Jewish?  No.  I'm playing that.  Play it.  No, she's gone, sir.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:57:00]  Uh, uh, uh, uh, and I'm going to be on.  Oh, oh, and it seems Opie is taking scissors.  And cut all of Sandy Cain's strings.  Oh, that's, uh, that's going to leave a mark.  Sandy, let me see. 
[00:57:30]  Boy, that really, uh, that improved the sound.  Cut of strings.  Well, I got to thank Danny.  He came up with the idea.  And I'm like, and stupid me, he gives me these scissors and she's plugged in.  I'm like, am I going to get electrocuted?  He's like, dude, you know, you're not going to get electrocuted.  And then I'm thinking, and then I go, Danny, how am I going to cut through?  He goes, they're nylon strings.  It's going to be really easy.  And man, it was extremely easy.  Yeah.  When you put a little tension on him, that's it.  It's over, Johnny.  Uh, Steve from Bejara.  That's such a funny line. 
[00:58:00]  Sandy has the perfect body for a mass grave.  God damn, Steve.  By the way, we filmed that.  You got me laughing.  That video will be up on onaradio.com later on today.  Also, it's up on YouTube right now if you want to search it out.  It's, uh, it's just, uh, type in Opie and Anthony and it's, uh, one of the latest videos  that has, uh, popped up on YouTube.  So, yeah.  A lot of fun on Friday.  All right.  Uh, also, uh, just, uh, trying to get some news out of the way.  The Cavs beat the Celtics. 
[00:58:30]  Um, Celtics still lead that series two games to one.  Penguins beat the Flyers, taking a 2-0 lead.  And, uh, the great, and I've been watching his HBO specials, uh, uh, I don't know, off  and on for the last week.  The great George Carlin is, uh, 71 years old today.  We should try to get him on the phone.  He's done our show a lot.  Yeah, I saw I was flipping around the channels and, uh, landed up on HBO and saw a very young  George Carlin.  Yeah.  Uh, just hysterically funny.  It doesn't matter what era you're watching from.  He's just, dude, goddamn funny. 
[00:59:00]  Get old George Carlin.  He's just as good.  That's what's creepy.  Yeah, I know.  He hasn't really lost it.  No.  At all.  You didn't get the box set when he came in?  Yeah, I think I did.  They gave us the George Carlin box set.  It has every HBO special on it.  I think I lost that in the, um, uh, the hostage exchange.  His last one was good, too.  He just did this whole thing on death.  And, uh, it was very funny, man.  He did a great, uh, I haven't seen that one yet.  That was the latest one, right?  It was a really funny point he made about how long after a friend dies do you wait before  you actually take him out of your phone book? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, god damn.  It was some point like that.  Or how he likes doing that or something like that.  It was really, it was just talking about this.  Like, oh yeah, I leave dead people in.  You gotta delete them from your phone.  Beep.  I know that, uh, for the most part, you guys don't like real moments, but I'll make it  quick.  Oh, boy.  My, uh, my dad's cell number's still on my phone.  So that one hit home, uh, Jenny.  Oh, sorry.  And I actually called it once when I was really sad.  Oh, jeepers.  And some foreign woman answered. 
[01:00:00]  Some foreign woman's got my, my dad's cell number.  Oh, god.  Of course.  Why would it be any different?  And that made me really sad.  It's like, stupid me, I'm thinking like when a loved one dies, the least the phone company  could do is like maybe not give out the cell phone to somebody else.  You're gonna say what, forward the calls to heaven?  Well, how about, how about, how you been?  You know what, but how about like, like in sports, you know, they retire numbers.  How about you retire cell phones, cell phone numbers of the dead?  Oof.  That's crazy, though.  Actually, and I still got it in my phone, hold on, real fast. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  We should call the lady, and I'll just have an uncomfortable phone call with her.  Conversation with her.  I'll do it off air.  Talk about how.  This used to be my dad's cell number, and now you have it.  You know, it's a big responsibility, because my dad was a great guy.  And now you have it.  And now you have it.  How does that make you feel?  So be courteous.  You have the cell phone number of a dead person.  You never think of that.  I wonder if we have like cell phone numbers of dead people.  Absolutely. 
[01:01:00]  You think the phone companies care?  No, of course they don't.  They're like, oh, this person's dead?  All right.  All right.  Another number to give out to somebody else.  Reminds me of that Twilight Zone.  Oh, boy.  The phone wire went over the grave.  And then you can hear like,  Where are you?  Where are you?  And she's like, hello?  Hello?  Oh, they're like, no, there was a storm.  And the phone wire came down, and it landed on the tombstone. 
[01:01:30]  Oh, God.  That creeped me out.  Look at me.  Oh, I got goosebumps.  I couldn't watch that.  Goddamn, Twilight Zone is still creepy.  At the end, you find out that that's what was happening.  This old woman is just sitting there like on the phone.  Hello?  Hello?  And she wanted to talk to the guy, I think,  but he couldn't quite hear her.  Yeah.  And then a phone bill came in.  It was like $8 billion.  Yeah.  And it was the 50s, so that's a lot of money.  Yeah.  He must have had AT&T.  That's why he didn't hear it.  Yeah.  She's on the Verizon. 
[01:02:00]  How many bars do you have?  What?  What are bars?  You know what?  Fast Freddy, I like you today.  Jamaica State.  Actually, I like Freddy for the most part.  He goes, today I learned, Oop's dad's not dead.  He just ran off at some Guatemalan housekeeper.  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  I like to think that my dad is still alive somewhere.  With a Guatemalan housekeeper.  Yeah, why not?  That makes it much easier visual to have, actually,  than the one I have in my dreams.  Oh.  Hey, Charles Barkley. 
[01:02:30]  Those go away after a while, by the way.  The dreams?  Dead dad dreams, yeah.  It's going to be four years this summer.  Nah, it takes a long time.  I was having those for a while.  You kind of hang out.  It's kind of cool, you know?  Kind of sit and chat, and then you realize,  oh, this is creepy, because you're dead.  Well, some people say your dreams,  you're actually, eh, communicating with dead people.  No, you're just dreaming.  Well.  That's what it is.  Some people would argue the other side of that.  Because then all of a sudden, you're on a boat that has a clown face for a motor.  It just doesn't make any sense. 
[01:03:00]  Stupid dreams.  I hate them.  Why do you have to ruin everything in logic?  Sorry.  I like to think that maybe I am talking to my dead dad.  Hey!  Thanks for ruining it.  Sorry.  That's how it is.  Charles Barkley got pwned over the weekend, I believe.  I love that song, Crazy He Does.  That's Gnarl's.  Oh.  Gnarl's.  Boo!  Boo!  Jimmy.  I'm tired.  Oh, no.  We might get into some of your jokes today. 
[01:03:30]  I really want to.  All right.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Wait.  You know what?  This is how quick we are.  This is how quick we are on this show.  Do that Orson Welles again.  Orson.  Boo!  Boo!  We've been playing the sounds of Orson Welles for a long time.  Yeah.  Over the last few days or a few shows.  Love those.  Well, Loose Fusion took those sounds and made something with it.  I think this could be the start of something. 
[01:04:00]  Loose Fusion.  Do the Orson Welles again.  Oh, yes.  This is a little intro to a commercial he was doing.  This is his first line.  Ah!  Ah!  This is what Loose Fusion did with that.  Right.  Make him say ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  We need more of that. 
[01:04:30]  That's too good.  We need to make that a little longer, man.  That is funny.  Oh, we're getting our cuddle party stuff together.  After the break, we've got more on the cuddle party thing.  Hey, I want to play the sounds of Steve.  Steve, see?  We took some of the noises he makes in the production room and someone put it to Metallica's one.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  It's quick, too.  We'll go.  Good week.  Better be at that Phillips.  Yes, sir.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  What now?  What now?  What now?  What now?  What now?  God bless  Invisitably  Out of my feet  Out of my water 
[01:05:30]  How can I live?  Out of my touch  Grinding myself  Fighting my holy soul  Out of my life  That's digging my sight  Digging my speech  Digging my handrakes  Digging my arms  Digging my legs  Down my soul, down my life in hell.  Wow, how cool is that?  Now I want to hear Metallica want.  I know.  That's all I want now. 
[01:06:00]  All you're doing is listening to that amazing beat.  Oh, my God.  That Lars, he is an ass, but wow.  That damn song gives me goosebumps.  That's an amazing, amazing.  What do you think, Danny?  You're a drummer.  What do you think of Lars?  I was average at best.  You think of Lars.  Lars really was average at best.  And the funny thing is, like, everybody who listens to that song, that's all they could  talk about is that part of one where it's the double bass.  That is, it's not slow double bass, but it's such a whatever pace.  Like, no one cares.  Shut up.  Yeah, what do you mean shut up? 
[01:06:30]  It rocks.  It does, I'm not saying it doesn't rock, but it's not.  We were joking when we said average at best.  Damn.  I think that's a great drum riff.  But that's not an impressive double bass roll.  Bring your drum set in.  Okay.  I want to see you do some drumming.  Who do you think's a great drummer?  Who do you really like?  Neil Peart.  Neil Peart.  Neil Peart.  Neil Peart.  Don't pick someone lame.  Neil Peart.  Man, favorite drummer of all time.  Or just one that you think is great.  Tommy Lee. 
[01:07:00]  I'll say Vinnie Paul has way more speed than Lars does from Pantera.  Damage player.  You don't think Lars has, like, endurance with his double bass playing?  There's some songs he's going through entire friggin' ten minute songs.  There are some, uh, uh, who, uh, I can't think of the goddamn band now.  Ugh.  How about Morag?  The drummer from Avenged Sevenfold could do double bass lines so fast, and he'll do them  for four and a half minutes straight.  Yeah, but it's just not, it's not just the double bass thing.  It's the whole, like, the whole thing. 
[01:07:30]  Like, Lars, Lars kicks ass on those songs.  Yeah, Justice was a great album.  I'll give him that much.  Okay.  Oh, I love, oh, wow.  Will you give him that much?  Danny's a drum snob.  You hear him?  I'll give him that much.  I'll give him that one, yeah.  I'll toss him a bone on that one.  A lot of music guys would say it's a masterpiece, but Danny will give him that much.  I think Lars, uh, is pretty good.  No, Justice for All is a masterpiece album, definitely.  I mean, Danny should be a drum snob.  He's played rock band for at least 30 hours.  Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, expert. 
[01:08:00]  Expert drums on rock band.  Expert.  Hidey, hidey, hidey.  Mr. We just owned you.  Are you playing expert on We Fitness yet?  We Fitness.  Leave the Wii alone.  That's what we want to do.  I want exercise in my video games.  Hey, they got to sit on my ass and kill things.  Hey, it's all the rage.  They got the trainers from Biggest Loser, and they came up with a game called Wii Fitness.  Oh, great.  So your character could be there with his big South Park head.  You could exercise.  Wonderful.  Kids love that. 
[01:08:30]  Ugh.  What other games do they have?  Healthy eating?  Well, actually, I think there is a cooking game.  There is a cooking game for the Wii.  No, there's not.  The Wii stinks on ice.  All right, now I can't defend the Wii if they have a cooking game.  But you can chop the vegetables with a little controller, Anthony.  Ah, because you have the controller.  Yeah, you can stir the controller.  So as you move the Wiimote, as they call it, it chops the vegetables.  How about you just cook?  Wait, isn't it called like Mama's Cooking Party or something?  Mama's Cooking Party? 
[01:09:00]  Cooking Mama.  Cooking Mama?  Ew.  Oh, is that horrid?  We were joking.  All right, get info on Cooking Mama.  Cooking Mama?  I've got to see what this is all about.  It would be funny if you were actually cooking your mother in the game.  That I could appreciate.  But cooking...  Because they're going to crucify us.  You've got Danny from Tool as the greatest drummer of all time.  Someone is mentioning...  I don't know his name.  Of course, Bonham from...  I don't know his name.  Lamb of God, dude.  I don't know his name either. 
[01:09:30]  Huh?  Chris Adler?  Just call him Lamb of God, dude.  Lamb of God, dude.  People want us to acknowledge as well.  And of course...  Ringo Starr.  And Phil Collins is coming in.  Phil Collins is ridiculous.  He's ridiculous.  Have you ever heard of some of his drum work?  How about Mickey D?  He was pretty sweet.  This is Susudio.  You know, he's an amazing lead singer, but you've got to throw Sully in there, man, from  Godsmack.  Sure, that drum...  When he gets behind the drums every once in a while. 
[01:10:00]  It's ridiculous.  I was reading in the paper Sully's doing a solo show down in Atlantic City this weekend.  Really?  Solo?  I'm thinking of going in...  Music Box?  Yeah, yeah.  Music Box.  He's doing a little solo thing.  Solo?  Maybe him and his acoustic...  Does he get an attitude?  No.  I think he's just doing a little acoustic thing.  Fanster?  Well, Steve made sure that we'd not forget Mike Portnoy from Dream Theater.  Who played...  What about my drummer from Foundry?  Did you hear some of the drumming and pendulum? 
[01:10:30]  Drum machine.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  We have to take a break, but Charles Barkley, this is where we were at, and then we went  off on a little tangent.  He's a great singer.  No.  No.  Oh.  No.  Oh, Jimmy said that already.  Go to YouTube for the people that are at their computers already.  Cooking Mama Wii Trailer.  Oh my God.  Look at how awful is this?  You're stirring sauce.  It looks like graphics from 1986. 
[01:11:00]  This is an awful game.  You're stirring.  You're using a rolling pin.  You're cutting meat.  Why won't you just cook for real?  Just cook.  The Wii is awful.  It's not...  That cooking isn't fun.  The Wii is not awful.  It is now.  Oh, see.  We lost Than, too.  The biggest supporter of the Wii.  You're the biggest supporter.  It is now.  Oh, God.  That's funny.  I was with you, Than, with the Wii bowling and the Wii tennis and the Wii boxing.  I was there.  Wii baseball's cool, but we cook.  There are Wii bowling leagues at bars.  They're a lot of fun. 
[01:11:30]  Where every Wednesday night or something, they get together, and it's like bowling night.  And it's horrid.  It's a great drinking game.  It's hot.  What are they making?  What are you putting?  Cheese on a burger?  Oh, I'll get the lettuce, too.  Wow.  Anthony, get a Wii game.  Yeah.  And next time you have some people over, get the beers flowing.  I'm telling you, you'll have a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Instead of banging chicks, you can play video games.  Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you've got to socialize with the women before you bang them.  It's not... 
[01:12:00]  With Wii cooking?  Yeah, do a little Wii cooking, and then you get them naked.  That's right.  When you're done virtually rattling those pots and pans, virtually get in the bedroom.  Exactly.  Before you have to virtually get a cab at this hour.  Virtually take care of that black eye.  We should have Wii Day on the Opie and Anthony show.  No, we shouldn't.  Wii Day on the Opie and...  We got a lot of things we got to do.  We got to get a cuddle party together, and now we're going to do Wii Day.  And drums.  We have a Wii on the other side.  We're doing Wii Day.  Okay.  Set up the Wii.  Right. 
[01:12:30]  I'll watch.  All right, listen.  Charles Barkley, let me get this in before we...  A Wii watch.  Is that something you can do?  With the Wii, you can watch people play a fun video game?  As long as you've got the Wii controller in your hand.  Yeah, the Wii moat, Opie.  It's a Wii moat.  A Wii moat.  Charles Barkley, I've been trying for about 15 minutes here.  Doesn't work three times.  He was...  You're making Ope crazy.  Hey!  Hey! 
[01:13:00]  It's just a quickie to go to break.  Ernie Johnson gets Barkley a la Anchorman.  They decide to F with Charles Barkley.  I think he had to be in on this.  No one does this stuff without telling the other person on network TV or whatever.  TBS or wherever the hell he's on.  I saw the...  I mean, the video's up everywhere.  He looked visibly stupid.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like he...  The minute he said what he said, he just pulled away and was like, oh no.  So basically on the teleprompter or whatever it's called...  Yeah, they wrote something that Charles wasn't supposed to say. 
[01:13:30]  At the end of what he was supposed to say.  And they got on the same.  All right.  Yeah, the video's everywhere.  We'll have it on onaradio.com later today.  Did you see the movie Anchorman?  No.  Ron Burgundy.  Remember where they said, go ahead, put that in there.  He'll read anything that's on the teleprompter.  A teleprompter is the machine here.  I mean, it's attached to the camera.  And so you read scripts.  So you're seeing some script there that they had Charles read for a T-Mobile spot at halftime  after we got off the air.  He'll read anything.  Yeah, and so I saw that when I was getting ready for the show earlier tonight. 
[01:14:00]  I looked at him and I said, what's this for Charles?  And I went, oh, let me just add a little something in here and see if he reads it.  Ha ha ha!  Roll it.  You're an idiot.  Hey, this is Charles Barkley.  I hope you're enjoying the NBA playoffs on TNT.  And I hope you have enjoyed my T-Mobile Fade 5 list.  I'm a dumbass.  Oh, my God.  That's pretty good.  I'm a dumbass.  It seemed like he was smiling. 
[01:14:30]  Are you sure he wasn't in on that?  I think by the end of dumbass, he had realized.  He realized?  Oh, my God.  He's been bamboozled.  All right.  People are talking about that today.  When we get back, we got more info on the cuddle parties.  We got our cuddle party dream team.  It's going to be Big A, Pat from Minaki, and Stalker Patty.  We're going to have him go to one of these cuddle parties here in New York.  Oh, we have to.  And also, when we get back, Hillary Clinton.  A woman is like a teabag.  She actually said that. 
[01:15:00]  Right?  We'll have the rest of that after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Comedians Rich Voss.  Rich Voss.  And Robert Kelly.  Robert Kelly.  All right.  Listen, this is Bob Kelly.  I don't even know if this is going to do any good, but I'll give it a shot.  Who's that, your wife?  I'm telling the funny half of you I said hello.  I'm not your wife.  June 6th, Count Basie Theater, Red Bank, New Jersey.  Shut the fuck up.  I let you say your shit.  So you did. 
[01:15:30]  I let you say it, and then I talked in between.  I didn't talk over you while you gave the info.  June 6th, Count Basie Theater, Redneck, New Jersey.  Red Bank.  Red Bank.  Who gives a fuck?  They're not showing up anyways.  Yeah, they will.  Not really?  No, no, no.  All right.  Yeah, Jersey's not bad.  I'm going to be doing it.  This is what he's getting at.  It's me, Patrice, and Mike DiStefano.  It's not Rich Voss.  No, it's not me.  No, Rich Voss is not on this tour.  It's almost like a little mini virus tour we're going to do. 
[01:16:00]  I set up, and I'm not on.  No, you didn't set up.  I planned you to fucking see.  Don't lie.  Story of fucking life.  I did that.  I told Charlie to do silent films.  Listen, Red Bank, New Jersey.  For tickets, 732-842-9000.  Or go to www.countbasietheater.org.  June 6th.  Me, Patrice O'Neal, and Mike DiStefano.  No Rich Voss. 
[01:16:30]  Rich Voss, I repeat, will not be there.  I won't be with Bobby anywhere, because they squeezed me out of the little tour that I thought  of to do.  Oh, God.  Opie and Anthony with Jim Norton.  Jimmy, you're not touring.  Why?  You're getting ready for your HBO show, huh?  Yes.  I'm preparing for that.  Very, very good.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We got lots going on today.  We got Hillary Clinton saying a woman is like a teabag. 
[01:17:00]  We got Obama saying there's 57 states.  We're getting that audio right now.  We got Bill O'Reilly flipping out, trying to read the teleprompter.  Yeah.  Yeah, also, we got a woman stabbing her boyfriend while they watched porn together.  We got audio on cuddle parties.  What do you want to do?  What do you want to do?  I want to hear Hillary say that.  You want to hear Hillary?  Yeah, I didn't hear about it.  What's going on with Hillary Clinton, really?  I don't know.  Everyone is basically saying, will you drop out of the race for the sake of the party?  Yeah.  And she refuses to. 
[01:17:30]  Why?  It's a selfish state.  She's ruining the party.  Obviously, it was her dream her entire life to be the first female president of the United  States of America, and she can't accept defeat.  It ain't panning out this time around, lady.  Leave.  That's right.  Give it to the other guy.  Oh, hey.  Hey.  The other guy.  Either that or she thinks that something's going to happen with him and Jeremiah Wright,  or she thinks he's going to self-destruct.  I was telling Anthony in the office, something is up.  I think she might have an atom bomb on Obama, but she doesn't want to break it out because 
[01:18:00]  she's still thinking if she might be just the vice president, which would be pretty cool  for her as well.  Because it doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense that she refuses to drop out for the sake of the party.  She's selfish.  So this is her latest soundbite.  A woman is like a teabag.  That's all.  Let me see. 
[01:18:30]  They can smell oniony on your nose.  Occasionally they both have strings hanging from them.  I'll give you one of these.  And one of these.  Thank you.  And this.  A lot nicer than my line.  Because they're both fun to put in scalding water.  Doesn't make sense.  That's funny.  She just comes up with these out of touch soundbites. 
[01:19:00]  Listen to the rest of this.  This is so awful.  The real answer.  A woman is like a teabag.  You never know how strong she is until she's in hot water.  How strong a teabag is until it's in hot water.  What does that mean?  You never know how strong a teabag is until it's in the hot water.  What?  Tea.  It's stupid tea.  The tea is strong.  Not the teabag.  I haven't seen it.  And I think you know because you bought it and you look and you go, oh, this is strong tea. 
[01:19:30]  Or this is just like regular tea.  Take a bra off.  These now look like teabags.  There you go.  What a dumb, is that one of her ad libs?  I've never seen.  Did someone write that for her?  I've never seen a teabag fall apart in hot water.  So what is she getting at?  You just never know how strong.  All teabags are strong.  That's their own purpose.  Oh, I thought you meant the taste of the tea.  But she means like the strength of the bag. 
[01:20:00]  I was thinking she's an old bag.  Now I, yeah.  Wow, who knows?  Whatever.  And then you got Obama doing this.  It is just wonderful to be back in Oregon.  And over the last 15 months, we've traveled to every corner of the United States.  I've now been in 57 states.  I think.  All right.  I was going to go with Jimmy that he's just tired.  But when you say I've been in 50 and he's still thinking how many. 
[01:20:30]  There is no excuse for that.  No.  You, every kid knows there's 50 states.  50 states.  That's it.  It's a nice even number.  It's been that way for quite a while now.  50.  Maybe he's been in 47 and he didn't mean to say 50.  Maybe he was thinking 47 or 37.  Oh, Jimmy, you're ruining our fun.  Oh, maybe he hasn't gone to Alaska.  Or maybe he knows Hawaii.  Hawaii.  No, he's been to Hawaii, right?  That's where he was born.  And the state of Puerto Rico.  Yeah, for some reason they can vote. 
[01:21:00]  Well, they got their own delegates or something.  Yeah.  What the hell's going on with Puerto Rico?  Oh, according to EROC, the teabag is an old Eleanor Roosevelt quote.  Of course.  Oh, really?  What's the original quote?  Yeah, what's the real quote?  Oh, who's that girl?  Here's the rest of Obama.  Three corner of the United States.  I've now been in 57 states.  I think one left to go.  One left to go.  So Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to, even though I really wanted to visit. 
[01:21:30]  But my staff would not justify it.  He meant 47.  Yeah.  But he said 57.  And they're laughing.  Yeah, they're laughing at him.  Politely laughing.  That's funny, dummy.  What's the quote there, EROC?  A woman is like a teabag.  You never know how strong she is until she gets into hot water.  So she ripped off Eleanor Roosevelt?  Well, did she quote her?  Did she say that beforehand?  She didn't say, and let me quote, from some old lesbian. 
[01:22:00]  Exactly.  Allegedly.  It's like a teabag.  Not allegedly.  A flow-through teabag.  You can spread it apart and stick your tongue through the teabag.  It's like Eleanor Roosevelt said, I wish I had a mustache so I could use it as a flavor  saver.  That's what she said, huh?  Yeah.  Yes.  It's like Eleanor Roosevelt said, ah, look, not one new pair of shoes in four years. 
[01:22:30]  We interrupt the Opie and Anthony show for this promo.  It's the first annual Opie and Anthony cuddle party.  Lace teddies.  Leather.  Boy shorts.  Alcohol.  Hot, scantily clad teen girls.  Where touching is allowed.  Stay tuned for more details.  See, we're going to do our own cuddle party.  Our own cuddle party.  It's a lot different than these boar fests that are happening all over the country. 
[01:23:00]  Stupid cuddle parties.  You want to explain it?  We got a whole new audience listening right now.  I got some audio and everything.  But I think what we're advertising is called an orgy.  Under the guise that it's a cuddle party.  Okay, it's a cuddle party.  I'm sorry.  That's the brilliance of us, my friend.  Yes.  A cuddle party is apparently these parties that they're putting on in cities where you pay  an admission fee, you go in your pajamas and bring a pillow, and you cuddle with people 
[01:23:30]  that you don't know.  You sit there.  First, you get into a welcome circle, and you have a little chat, and then you have to  ask if it's okay to cuddle, and if the answer is yes, then you can spoon or hug face to face  or maybe just lay there with your arm over each other.  Laughter or tears are welcome.  Are very acceptable.  But you're not allowed to dry hump.  That's rule seven, right?  Rule seven, no dry humping.  What about erotic asphyxiation? 
[01:24:00]  Are you allowed to just choke a bitch out?  Laughter's allowed.  Tears are preferred.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  It just sounds like the worst thing you could ever go to.  And we want to send a couple of our faithfuls from this show over to a cuddle party.  Bunch of guys in their cars right now going, all right, guys, what's the catch?  There is no catch.  There is no catch.  No.  That is it.  It's a cuddle party.  It's non-sexual.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, you're not allowed.  So, yeah, our dream team is Big A, Pat from Wynaki, and Stalker Patty. 
[01:24:30]  We've got a couple cuddle parties happening here in New York in the very near future.  We're going to try to get one or all three of them at a cuddle party, and then we'll get  we'll get their feedback on the whole thing.  I'm great with that, B.  Hey, here's some audio on the cuddle party.  In today's non-stop rush to get here and there, maneuvering through a crowd or in and  out of traffic, some people worry they're losing touch with each other.  Now there's a way to really reach out and touch someone else at a cuddle party.  This may look like a pajama party for grown-ups or something else altogether. 
[01:25:00]  But it's not.  It's just a cuddle party.  Rule number one, PJs stay on the whole time, okay?  This is a non-sexual event.  Okay, so now that we have that out of the way, just what is a cuddle party?  This is a way of creating touch in a positive way.  Edie Weinstein-Moser says the parties, like this one in a Phoenixville living room, are meant  to help people achieve better intimacy and communication.  Spooning, massaging, snuggling, nuzzling. 
[01:25:30]  Ew.  You know, I just had the greatest image.  We should, like this is going to happen, but we should force him to go to a cuddle party.  Anthony.  What?  Because you hate any contact with any human being.  Get out of town.  Can you imagine?  We shouldn't have told you.  We should have just made you show up in one of these things.  And all of a sudden, these strangers are attempting to hug you.  No way in hell.  You would lose your mind.  They'd wonder, who's the creep in the space suit?  Yeah, I'd be in an outbreak suit. 
[01:26:00]  Why is Bubble Boy here?  Yeah, I wouldn't mind cuddling with certain people.  I think a certain, you know, attractive girl would be nice.  But at the second some dude comes up, I just want to cuddle.  Oh.  That would be just.  No touching.  Do you think Lily would come to our cuddle party?  You want to cuddle with Lily?  Of the crew we have on both shows, she's the best option.  Yeah, we're going to have a cuddle party. 
[01:26:30]  What, E-Rock?  E-Rock?  Cuddle with E-Rock?  E-Rock?  Are you allowed to go to the cuddle party?  You want to cuddle, E-Rock?  Probably not.  You wouldn't be allowed?  No guy's allowed to go to a cuddle party.  I want to know it's non-sexual.  Try to tell your wife or girlfriend you're going to a cuddle party.  It's non-sexual.  Stop it.  Don't argue.  Here's more audio on the cuddle party.  Then everyone's ready for a group hug right away, though, since you may not know everyone.  The first step, whether you're with a partner or by yourself, is to sit and chat in a welcome circle.  You hear the rules. 
[01:27:00]  You have to ask permission and get a verbal yes before you touch anybody.  Any pink sock-ing?  When it grieves, the cuddling begins.  Allows people to express themselves in a comfortable and safe environment.  I finally completely overcome my social anxiety, which I've been suffering for decades.  Cuddle party jumps out the window.  Bunch of neurotic messes.  No kidding, man.  I have social anxiety.  This helped my social anxiety.  Did it? 
[01:27:30]  Plus you're like a bowling ball.  I had a good nuzzle session with a plushie on a cuddle party.  What a bunch of creeps.  So many rules.  Exactly.  I would adhere to.  How about some fun ones, like after all the other ones?  Whites only and no fat pigs.  Whites only.  Lay down no cuddle rules.  Whites only.  Cuddled.  Yeah, just completely racist and horrid.  Decades.  Cuddle parties last for about three hours. 
[01:28:00]  TJs and...  Three hours.  How do you cuddle for three effing hours without effing?  This is a, uh, uh, I don't even know if you can say it on the air.  Instead of a cuddle party, this is a, uh, uh, a blue ball party.  I'm just gonna say it.  It's, it's a c*** tease party.  Yes.  That's what it is.  Yes, thank you, Anthony.  It's a, it's a, it's yes.  Oh, you're leaving in some pain.  It's a blank tease party.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  And you stand up and your shoes will fill up. 
[01:28:30]  I would only, I would almost understand if it's like a half hour or something.  Three hours.  Three hours of cuddling.  Well, how long does the welcome circle last?  Well, probably at least an hour and a half.  I just start f***ing, just, just crank right there on the wall.  Hey, how you doing?  How you doing?  Welcome.  I thought I'd poke through the front of the PJs.  Oh, that's how that happens.  If you leave that stupid, useless fly open on your PJs and it just kind of goes flop. 
[01:29:00]  Here it is.  You just.  Hi, welcome.  I'm here.  And you look at all them, like, look who made an appearance at the club.  Well, welcome him to the welcome circle, ladies.  Speaking of that noise.  Yeah.  Stunt brain's got some info on that.  Don't you have info on the, uh.  Yeah, in rule seven, if they say that that reaction is natural and we're all expected to  have it, but you're not expected to dry hump, as they say in rule seven. 
[01:29:30]  And that's a violation.  Oh, so you can't do that.  But it's, it's okay if you get a little aroused as a gentleman.  Yeah, people, people understand if they, if you go to a cuddle party that that may happen  and it's okay.  And it's okay.  Don't turn around and go, ew, or, or something.  But, I mean, what the hell?  You're snuggling with a gardening pole.  It's just, what do you.  Raise your hand.  Your cuddle partner raises your hand if you violated rule seven and you're sent to the 
[01:30:00]  cool down room.  There's a cool down room.  Ew.  You have violated rule seven?  All the wallpaper is lemon party.  That cools you off.  That cools you off.  It's two girls, one cup.  Two girls, one cup and lemon parties playing in the room.  Actually.  Oh, God.  We actually got audio on how they handle the, uh, the slide whistle.  Let's just call it the slide whistle.  But first, uh, the rest of this quote.  Stuffed animals are optional.  These folks enjoyed themselves.  They tell me that they leave feeling lighter emotionally, physically. 
[01:30:30]  You can't help but smile being around them.  And who doesn't love a good hug once in a while?  Um, most people?  A good hug once in a while.  You like to give your girl a good hug?  Maybe like a hug from your parents every once in a while, but from a stranger?  No.  I don't want one of those.  A stranger?  That's too weird.  It's too personal.  I don't want that.  I kind of like, um, you know.  There's a, uh.  I like basking in a little afterglow with kind of a, you know. 
[01:31:00]  With a nice straw.  Kind of a hangout.  You know.  Kind of lay your head here.  I'll put my arm here kind of a thing.  It's kind of nice.  Here's what we're learning about.  Jimmy's got that just get out of my room look on his face.  A hug is something you do to get there.  Once it's done like, yeah, let's have a hug.  And then she feels and then you touching her ass.  To get there.  My hug is.  I hug, I go right for the ass cheeks.  I don't care if it's a death or a grieving.  That's violation.  I'm sure that's a violation.  My grandmother died. 
[01:31:30]  Come here, whore.  That's got to be a violation.  Just your first hug is just grabbing both cheeks.  And holding her against you.  Excuse me.  And you know how.  Cuddle catty.  And you lock your leg around her so she can't move away.  And you know how hot that feels if they're just wearing pajamas?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  But, Jimmy, speaking of that, if sexual energy in the room gets too high,  you're assigned a cuddle buddy.  Think pool buddies.  Who will grab your hand and raise it at the blow of a whistle.  What? 
[01:32:00]  Who blows the whistle?  Who?  They have someone that walks around with a whistle.  Cuddle lifeguards.  Oh, they're called cuddle lifeguards?  And all of a sudden they see some energy going on that might not be good for a cuddle party?  They blow the whistle.  And they raise your hand up?  Like, here's the friggin' violator?  Here's the sexual deviant?  That is something.  Speaking of the slide whistle thing, which is acceptable, they say, look, it's acceptable.  This is going to happen.  They explain this.  That's the universal sound of the boner. 
[01:32:30]  They explain that in this clip here.  And you may be wondering if certain physical reactions happen, especially to some of the guys at a cuddle party.  Well, the answer is yes.  It's okay to be attracted to someone or be aroused.  You're just not allowed to act on that arousal.  Safe space, remember?  And the cutlers seem to dig the vibe here.  So, any hookups after class?  That's what I'm asking.  It is not at all a sexual space. 
[01:33:00]  It's a space for friendship and connection.  The afternoon ends with a puppy pile.  Everyone just piles on top of each other and relaxes.  As much as you can relax with several people on top of you.  Take another deep breath.  A puppy pile.  Right outside of a Chinese restaurant.  I like the puppy pile.  Let's make our staff do a puppy pile today.  Look, it's the pile.  They say it's non-sexual, so no one should be creeped out.  What if you just have, like, junk right near your face and it's not, you know. 
[01:33:30]  You're the lucky devil.  A puppy pile.  Who makes this up?  This is so dumb.  And then they all go, ah.  Here's something.  Here's something.  How about you just live your childhood?  Yeah.  You know, when you have a chance at a childhood, you should be living that.  Not trying to live your childhood when you're 40-flurf.  A puppy pile.  What is that?  A puppy pile I want to see is outside the chamber at a dog pound. 
[01:34:00]  Puppy pile.  Do you want to hear more or were you pretty much there?  Please.  I think we might have done it, but let's see what this clip's about.  It is called A Cuddle Party.  A place where consenting adults, often strangers,  dressed in their PJs,  pay to actually touch each other.  Sounds strange?  Well, we thought so, too.  So we sent 11 used Donna Hamilton out to New York to check it out.  Thank you so much.  These are awesome.  Look at you.  These pajama-clad New Yorkers who don't know each other are signing up and paying their 
[01:34:30]  30 bucks for cuddling.  I thought, okay, that's a little creepy.  Sure.  Well, you figure people who come, you know, everybody's feeling the same thing.  So hopefully you can get beyond the creepiness.  Oh, your first cuddle party?  This is actually my very first cuddle party.  Nervous?  Somewhat.  Well, it's kind of cutesy, but it's, you know, it's something new, something different.  I'm obsessed with this concept and how ridiculous it is.  The guy's voices sound very effeminate. 
[01:35:00]  Yes.  I'll just say that.  Every guy that has spoken, very effeminate voice.  Well, because they're saying it's non-sexual.  So I bet you if you go to one of these things, all of a sudden you're like, what did I get  myself into?  Why are men hugging me?  I'm here thinking I could hug and cuddle with like a woman.  That's what I'm thinking.  Like all of a sudden you get yourself in a situation like, oh my God, grown men are hugging  me and nuzzling against my neck with their, with their beard.  You know what I'd like to see?  Jimmy go to one with an awful gas problem. 
[01:35:30]  We've been in this studio where it's unbearable.  Just that Jimmy cuddling and stink the entire place.  I need some White Castle and some ice cream.  And grapes.  And half and half.  Oh, would that be a great, you would ruin the cuddle party.  My throat would be all clogged.  Damn!  Damn!  Someone just feels this heat.  You're cuddling.  They're cuddling up to you and they just feel. 
[01:36:00]  Just hot air.  And then the smell of a waste treatment plant.  Oh, I would love to scroll.  Open septic tank.  Oh, that would be great.  That would be.  Oh, would that be fantastic?  Watching everyone just roll away from you.  You're left alone at the cuddle party.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Reed and Marcia say this pajama party is really a workshop that touches a basic human need like food or sleep. 
[01:36:30]  And that many people in today's modern world are touch deprived.  They spend the first hour explaining the rules.  That the party is what they call a non-sexual space.  A safe space where boundaries must be set.  They get everyone to practice saying no.  If somebody says no to you today, it might have nothing to do about you.  Sure.  There are people who come to cuddle parties to practice saying no.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  What a cop out that is. 
[01:37:00]  You're a pig.  You stink.  You're ugly.  No one wants to cuddle with you.  No one wants to hug you.  That's why you get a no.  They just come to practice to say no.  You can do that at home.  No.  See?  It's easy.  Because they know a lot of people are going to go to these things that never got hugged  as a kid.  Yeah.  And the rejection continues.  The rejection will be terrible.  Into their adulthood.  And it's going to continue at the cuddle party when you're assuming that everyone's  just going to hug you because you're in that environment.  I'm not going to ask for a hug.  I don't think I could take that kind of rejection.  So they have to say that people actually go there to practice saying no. 
[01:37:30]  Stop.  How come she's not practicing with him?  Why is he only practicing?  She's just practicing with me.  Because when Big A wants to cuddle with you, you're just practicing saying no.  Right.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah.  And the well-endowed girl that decided, even though it's a non-sexual event, decided to  wear no bra with her pajamas.  They're lining up to hug her.  Yeah.  Okay.  Your hug is my density.  Practice saying no. 
[01:38:00]  Okay.  There is some mooing.  Everyone is a cow for a moment.  And then.  How?  Tip yourself over onto your side.  And do that now.  And the cuddling starts a little nervously.  There are back rubs, foot rubs, massages, even a back rub train.  A train.  Give me a break.  You can't use a word like train and keep it non-sexual.  A little daisy chain. 
[01:38:30]  Oh my God.  I'm obsessed with this.  We got to go.  We got it.  I need more info.  I need visual information on cuddle parties.  We have to infiltrate one of these cuddle parties.  Please.  Somehow, some way.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  God.  Huh.  Just the one word we dumped.  I thought they would, actually.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's a silly word.  I know.  Every kid uses it.  He's.  All right.  When we get back, Bill O'Reilly losing his mind and woman stabs boyfriend while they watch 
[01:39:00]  porn.  Reverend Allo, some taxes.  And an ex-manager of OJ says OJ confessed murdering Nicole to him.  Is this.  Wow.  That's old news right now.  Unbelievable.  Old news.  What happened with Nicole?  What?  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning to everybody.  It's Monday.  Yuck.  Yuck.  We're having a pretty good show for a Monday. 
[01:39:30]  All delirious.  We learned earlier that Anthony finally got a speeding ticket, if you're just tuning in.  Finally got a speeding ticket.  95 and a 55.  Nice.  Yikes.  Nice.  Also, let the speculation begin, but somebody in this room right now will be leaving the  Opie and Anthony show at the end of the month.  Let the speculation begin.  And somebody in the room right now will be leaving the Opie and Anthony show by the end 
[01:40:00]  of the month.  And I must say, I'm not happy about it.  That's big news.  That is big news.  Big news.  Somebody.  Somebody.  In the room.  In the room.  Will be leaving the Opie and Anthony show at the end of the month.  At the end of the month.  Oh.  And in other news.  People are saying, please be E-Rod. 
[01:40:30]  They love you.  Reverend Al owes nearly $1.5 million in unpaid taxes.  How much?  1.5 mil.  I'm sure he'll just pawn that off on his little organization there, the Action Network, whatever.  National Action Network.  Yeah.  They'll have to pay it.  He'll get his supporters to pay it.  That's what he does all the time.  Or he'll just continue to not pay it.  Just like Stephen Pagonis' settlement that he was supposed to get. 
[01:41:00]  Did someone pay that for him?  Yeah.  Of course.  This guy's just a dirtbag.  He is just a used people.  He gets followers that give him money.  That's why he goes around in nice vehicles.  Wears nice suits now.  What happened to the jogging suit, big medallion, Al Sharpton?  Where'd that guy go?  How come now he's wearing the nice suits?  He travels around like a diplomat.  And it's all on his peep's dime.  Anthony.  Yes, sir.  Not that I'm comparing, obviously, but...  Yes, sir. 
[01:41:30]  Yes, sir.  Do you remember our first publicity shots?  Yeah.  Now I got...  I had hair down to my shoulders.  I got short hair now.  You had a massive afro.  I understand.  It was...  You know, people grow up and change their image as they...  Yeah, but you know, when you have a...  You're flocking...  You're fleecing your flock to get these clothes.  I guess we are.  We're putting out really bad entertainment for money, so...  He figured he would change his image so more people would listen to him. 
[01:42:00]  It's obvious.  Yeah.  You know, it's a marketing scheme.  Also, ex-manager says O.J. confessed that he murdered Nicole.  This was after his acquittal.  They're hanging around.  And this guy claims that O.J. loved the pot.  And he was smoking pot and stuff.  And A.J. Cowlings...  He was talking to A.J. Cowlings and said,  Look, man, we all know why...  Why didn't you say anything?  And A.J. Cowlings said something like,  Well, the kids already lost their mother.  I mean, A.C.  Why am I saying A.J.?  A.C. Cowlings basically said, 
[01:42:30]  Look, these kids lost their mother.  It wouldn't be good for them to also lose their father,  knowing the father killed the mother  and have him in jail for the rest of their lives.  Because you've got to remember,  the kids were very small at the time.  Yeah.  That's A.J.  A.C. Cowling.  A.C. Cowling's taking the whole thing.  So then this manager decided to ask O.J.  And O.J. basically said that Nicole would be alive today  if she didn't come to the door with a knife.  Hmm.  Hmm. 
[01:43:00]  So she probably was like,  Oh, no, here comes O.J. again.  And she went to the door with a knife  to pretty much make him go away.  And the rest is history.  That's what this guy's saying.  Why didn't Ron Goldman go out the other door?  Yeah.  He probably just wanted to tell her to get the knife.  Show that big face staring in the window.  He's like, get the knife.  Get the knife.  Your husband's here.  O.J.'s here.  Get the knife.  Please.  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, I don't know how O.J. could smoke weed.  That, like, after you do something horrible like that,  wouldn't you get a little freaked out?  Well, yeah.  I think everything would be a bad trip. 
[01:43:30]  A beer would be a bad trip.  Oh, my God.  All the blood.  Ugh, I saw her throat.  Insomnia would be a bad trip.  Yeah.  Just not being able to sleep.  How do you go to sleep after you do something like that?  That brutal.  Yeah.  Well, this guy, I mean, he should have talked a while ago.  It's no surprise now.  Wow.  Brave to talk now.  Yeah.  Who cares at this point?  Mm-hmm.  No one cares.  I know.  We got Club Soda Kenny in studio.  A lot of people hoping for traffic and weather together on the 8th.  Not today, my friends.  Not today.  We don't want to burn out that bit, but Club Soda Kenny is doing some morning zoo type 
[01:44:00]  of bits for us.  And today, what are you doing, Kenny?  Horoscopes.  Horoscopes?  Yeah.  Horoscopes with Club Soda Kenny.  Ooh, very mystical-sounding music.  Yes.  Take it away, Club Soda Kenny.  Good morning, handsome people.  It's once again time for Horoscopes on the Opie and Anthony Show with me,  Club Soda Kenny. 
[01:44:30]  What do you mean once again?  This is the first time we're doing it.  I mean, right away, I'm off to a bad start.  Don't worry.  You'll pull it all together, I'm sure.  All right.  Aries.  Yeah.  Why'd you even bother getting out of bed this morning?  Nothing's going to go right for you today.  You're probably going to get a splinter in your foot when you get out of bed.  Your cornflakes will be infested with roaches. 
[01:45:00]  And don't even think about going to work, because all your tires have been slashed.  Wow.  That's pretty specific.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.  Every single one, every single Aries is going to have that happen to them today.  Well, it's a horoscope.  You've got to read more horoscopes.  They make it very vague.  Vague.  That makes a lot of people feel like, you know, the horoscope is talking to them directly.  This is going to happen.  You're a little too specific when you're horoscope.  You're very specific.  You mentioned the breakfast food by name.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What about the Aries that eat, like, granola in the morning and yogurt? 
[01:45:30]  They don't count.  All right.  Jesus.  Cancer people, I hope you don't have any travel plans, because I wouldn't get on that  plane today if I was you.  Gemini, your communication skills are normally your biggest asset.  Not today.  You might as well crazy glue your lips shut, because the more you talk, the worse your day  is going to get. 
[01:46:00]  You might have to try something sneaky later on in the day, so think about pouring a little  Drano in your boss's coffee cup.  Taurus, don't answer the phone today unless you want bad news.  Leo, you need to work on a financial issue that you don't fully understand yet.  So let me clarify.  You're broke.  You spent way too much money on hookers last month, and now you can't pay your rent. 
[01:46:30]  So why don't you get a ski mask and a tire iron and go mug an old lady?  They're usually good for a C-note.  Virgo, you'll probably fall down an elevator shaft today.  Why?  An elevator shaft?  Every Virgo?  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a lot of people.  There's a lot of elevator shafts.  Apparently.  A lot of broken ones.  Yeah.  Libra, you are very sensitive socially, and you have a hard time making the first move 
[01:47:00]  when it comes to women.  Today is the day to step up.  You know that cute little blonde receptionist you want to ask out?  Get a rag, some ether, and a hammer, and it's time to man up.  Sagittarius?  Car crash?  That had Steve written all over it.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, hammering ether always has to be in the horoscope.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:47:30]  Scorpio, people around you are gossiping today, and it really hurts your feelings.  A lot of people are going to tell you to ignore it, but what you really need to do is nip  it in the bud.  The next time you see those busy buddies flapping their gums, you hit them with a super soaker  filled with battery acid.  They'll have a hard time yapping with their lips and tongues melting off.  That's right, busy buddies.  Yeah.  Busy buddy.  Yeah.  Capricorn, a wheelchair for you. 
[01:48:00]  Sagittarius, STD in your future.  And Pisces, your incestuous secret will be exposed today.  And now, you know, there's a lot of celebrity birthdays today.  Oh, really?  I didn't know we were doing celebrity birthdays today.  I like to mix it up.  I do.  Wow, this is a nice surprise for everybody.  Yeah.  You know, the great George Carlin is 71 today. 
[01:48:30]  God bless him.  Why are we doing his horoscope music still?  Okay.  Yeah.  George Carlin's 71 today.  God bless him.  Yogi Berra, 83.  And in honor of Burt Bacharach, who is 80 years old today, I would like to sing this song  and dedicate it to you, G.H.  Are you kidding?  Oh, wow.  Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near, just like me, they look to be close 
[01:49:00]  to you.  Burt Bacharach wrote that?  He sure did.  It's one of his hits.  I thought the Carpenters did that one.  Yeah, but he wrote it.  Oh, he wrote it.  Yeah, and that bulimic stole it.  Why do stars fall down from the sky?  Second verse.  Every time you walk by, just like me, they long to be close to you. 
[01:49:30]  On the day that you were born, the angels got together and decided to create a dream come  true so they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and starlight in your eyes of blue  that is why all the girls in town follow you all around come on everybody just like me

[02:08:30]  why  so did danny  shut up  hey  i'm just gonna throw you under the bus  to be  no correction  i saw half of it  oh that's right  you walked out  why did you guys go see the little mermaid together?  we didn't go see it together  we didn't see it together  which man wants to go see that?  i saw it  you know  yuck  with the uh...  with the ex  really?  yeah  was it good?  no it was a little mermaid-y  what was it good?  you know  the girl was kinda hot  she was 14 probably 
[02:09:00]  no  she's uh... an adult  oh okay  yeah  but um...  yeah they  i don't know  do they have some kind of boat  that's above the stage  that you can see as you're like  going through your seat or something?  well it's like when they do the uh...  when they do like the on the boat scenes  this huge boat is like  kinda on the stage level  and then when they do the underwater scenes  this huge boat thing  platform like lifts up like 30 feet  and then it's under the sea  so you can kinda see under the sea 
[02:09:30]  huge thing  the light changes so it looks like you're underwater  but how come the water doesn't leak all over the lights?  I'm confused  well listen what happened  i mean this is just terrific  there was some real life drama at the lundfontein theater this afternoon  where 51 year old adrian bailey  one of the ensemble cast members of the broadway musical the little mermaid  broke both his wrists after falling at least 20 feet through a trap door to the stage  the show was delayed for about an hour 
[02:10:00]  as emergency officials responded to the scene  set up a tent and shot him  his crook wrists  the audience was in the theater  but the curtain was down  you could hear the thump on the floor  loud thump on the floor  then you heard someone scream  then you heard someone yell  medic  wow  medic  medic  medic  is there a doctor in the house?  i'm sure a guy on broadway  his lips 
[02:10:30]  his wrists being limp  would be very foreign for him  yeah  those are supposed to be pretty pliable  there you go  it must have been a hell of a ball  that's gonna be inconvenient  he'll have to use his feet  the broadway actor who was conscious at the time  he was taken to Bellevue hospital where he was treated for his injuries  this fan of the actor who was at this afternoon's  oh by the way this fan of the actor  uh... thank you whoever wrote this  even though he's never had a major role 
[02:11:00]  the news talks to a fan of the actor and says the audience still enjoyed the show  the actor who was at this afternoon's performance says he was surprised  when he didn't see bailey performing in the matinee  his appearance is dramatic and really striking his great smile  and i noticed he wasn't in the show  and most of the audience members whom we spoke would say  the actors were terrific  the show was great  and you'd never know that something was wrong  and that it really was a testament  to the actors professionalism  that they were able to go on 
[02:11:30]  in the face of such an accident  yeah  you know why don't you  why don't you do the right thing  and you know close up for the day  why  guy's fine  broke his wrists  yeah  those two little wrists  i guess you're right  why do i care  they tinker  but i'll get the emergency room  they don't really  bust apart those stereotypes  no  fabulous  smile  it's just beautiful  it was so  it was so stereotypically gay  yeah  the entire audience  yeah 
[02:12:00]  like it was almost like a joke  you couldn't fit another gay person  in that  in that theater  sure you could  turn the seat upside down  he made such a dramatic entrance  as he plummeted from the bottom of the boat  like Owen Hart  that was part of the show  oh god  oh  what too soon  too soon  poor Owen  well he fell  yeah i know  the blue blazer jimmy  yeah  well i'm gonna give a  i'm gonna give ourselves a b plus for today

[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  I had to break out the winter coat.  What's that about?  Winter coats came back out for a little walkover.  So much for that global warming, right? 
[02:18:30]  I don't drive often because I don't drive often because I'm a city boy.  I had to go out to Long Island for Mom's Day.  And wow, I paid over $4 for the first time.  I paid over $4 for the first time.  It was very expensive.  It was very expensive.  It was...  What the fuck is that about?  It went over the $80 mark to fill my vehicle up.  80 bucks.  What the hell is that about?  And Jimmy walks in with a Hustler. 
[02:19:00]  Good boy.  I like Hustler and a rod.  You like the cartoons.  I really do.  Hustler's the best porn magazine ever.  All right.  Give me one cartoon from Hustler you like.  Those are the ones that happen to be opened.  All right.  There's a girl.  She's probably 13.  She's fat.  She's yelling over her shoulder.  Ma, dad dropped off your alimony check.  And in front of the stoop is a pile of shit with a check stuck in it.  All right.  That's a good tip of shit.  That's really good.  That's the best porn magazine ever, Hustler.  That's a great suggestion. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're not going to just tell you who's leaving the show.  That's silly.  There's no fun in that.  We want some chatter to happen.  A little chatter.  But somebody is leaving the Opie and Anthony show at the end of the month.  End of the month.  Are they in studio right now?  Hey, we got a couple uncensored things to play over here.  Of course we're going to do this for you.  Yeah, that's where we do it.  We'll start with the Bill O'Reilly.  So Bill O'Reilly on Inside Edition back in the day. 
[02:20:00]  It's on YouTube if you want to check it out.  He looks like a complete asshole.  He is crazy.  I mean, we sat down in an interview with him back in the day, back in the day.  And he walked in and he was so fucking pompous.  Arrogant.  Remember it?  And we didn't really know much about him at that point.  Yeah.  He was just starting to make it with his O'Reilly factor.  Yeah.  He was such a douche.  And just, please take a seat there.  And he complimented us and talked nice before the interview. 
[02:20:30]  Wow, you guys are very successful.  Very entertaining.  Very funny.  A lot of people don't know you're a very funny show.  All they know is the edgy, dirty stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all he talked about.  And see, you could tell that we were green as far as interviews go.  Because then he sits us down and just railed us on the dirty shit.  And never said that we're a funny show.  And maybe we should focus on being, you know, less edgy and dirty and more funny. 
[02:21:00]  He didn't go down any of those roads.  He made us look like complete assholes.  Yeah.  We should have seen a red flag there when he was being nice to us.  Because anytime they're nice to you before the interview, it's going to be a disaster.  Yeah.  God, people just, I don't know.  A lot of people are like, thank you for playing Ecstasy of Gold.  Because they don't get to hear it on XM anymore.  We still, they play Ecstasy of Gold just before we hit the airwaves on regular radio.  And we dropped it as far as this side of the show.  But then we're like, you know what?  Let's play it every once in a while. 
[02:21:30]  So a lot of people are like, oh, dude, that was cool to hear Ecstasy.  I haven't heard it in a while.  And then other people, what the fuck, dude?  Why are you playing Ecstasy?  Why are you playing that horse shit?  What the hell?  What's up with that?  What are you doing?  Bill O'Reilly, uncensored, flipping out as he reads the reading machine for Inside Edition  back in the day.  Whose pussy lips are you looking at?  Jesse Jane's tits.  Let me see.  She is fucking, she's just a phenomenal looking girl.  Oh, my God.  Jesse Jane is.  She was in, she was in, right?  No.  We've never had her in. 
[02:22:00]  She looks like the one that ran out that day.  No, that was Tony Roberts.  Sorry.  Let's see, spin that around and take a look.  How fucking hot is she?  Oh, my God.  They just look nice and heavy.  She's nice, too.  She's really nice.  Oh, you've met her and everything?  She's fucking so hot.  What makes her nice, Jimmy, besides the really nice tits?  She's cute.  She has a rare combination of being like a sexy fuck machine and being really cute.  Sexy fuck machine.  Like, I'd like her to kiss me on the cheek and then ride my dick and spit in my face  and suck a black one and cuckold me. 
[02:22:30]  All at a cuddle party.  Yes.  Are you at cuddle parties or what?  Well, not at the moment, no.  Jim, you're single.  You should go to a cuddle party.  You would give us a great report from a cuddle party.  You'd probably get recognized.  People would be like, ugh, it'll just make me sad.  What happened then?  She was in studio and she was the one that was sick.  Thank you.  Oh, I wasn't here that day.  Oh, that's why.  Okay.  She was sick.  Oh, she threw up or something?  That was a weird story, Jimmy.  She was in and we were doing very well and then all of a sudden out of nowhere she got 
[02:23:00]  sick and ran.  Wow.  Why are they showing dead people?  Because they're far away.  Dead people.  They're sleeping.  They're showing the monsoon deaths.  In Myanmar.  Yeah.  Just bodies pop.  Wow.  Are they just showing a bunch of dead people?  Next to an ox.  That's pretty...  You know, show fucking tits then on TV because that was a little disturbing.  Yeah.  Tits aren't disturbing.  That was fucking disturbing.  That really was disturbing. 
[02:23:30]  Usually I'm not affected by that, but then...  Bloated fucking drowned bodies.  That fucking HD is ruining it for everybody because usually when you saw death in faraway places,  it was kind of fuzzy video, so you're like, oh, that must have happened a long time ago.  Yeah.  But now with this HD, it's way too real.  Oh, they just...  What a horrible, horrible situation.  They should just show fucking hardcore pornography because that isn't nearly as offensive as what  I just saw.  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  We're so silly.  We're just an uptight society.  I don't think people would have sexual hang-ups if you showed some nudity on regular TV.  Simple as that.  What site is that, Dan?  What is it looking at?  Animalballs.com.  I'm sorry, because you said they should show hardcore pornography.  So you looked up hardcore pornography?  No.  And Travis had just sent me a link to Animal Balls.  Animal Balls rules.  It's just pictures of animals' balls.  Like kittens licking a cat's balls. 
[02:24:30]  What the hell is that?  Wow, is that a pig?  I think it's a pig.  Oh, my God.  Pig balls.  Huge pig balls.  Dirty pig feet.  Get a link to this somewhere.  All right.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Openanthony.com or Foundry, wherever the fuck.  Yeah, I was trying to make some kind of statement, man.  Yeah, man.  On our behavior in this country.  Yeah.  Sexual deviance because we hide sex.  Hide the boobies.  Huh?  Hide the boobies.  Hide the boobies, right.  But show the bodies.  All right. 
[02:25:00]  Duh.  Bill O'Reilly.  Why did she puke?  Now we need to know.  I don't remember, but we were doing something, and she bailed out, and she tapped out and  started puking.  Let's see what the official answer is.  All right.  We'll find out.  Yeah, she was puking.  Why Jesse James ran and puked.  Yeah.  She did look familiar.  We did want her to do something.  And what are you looking at now, Jimmy?  I'm sorry.  She's a big fat pussy.  Big juicy puss.  All right.  Here's Bill O'Reilly, uh, uncensored.  Bill O'Reilly.  That's tomorrow.  And that is it for us today. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  I don't know.  Whatever it is, it's not right on a teleprompter.  I don't know what that is.  I've never seen that.  No, there is.  We are going to do sting.  Yeah.  Okay, but.  Now, I can't read it.  There's no, there's no words on it.  Okay.  Okay.  Sure.  There's no words there.  To play us out.  What does that mean?  To play us out.  It's, sting is going to do, it's a video.  Sting video.  What is.  For credits.  I don't know what that means, to play us out. 
[02:26:00]  What does that mean?  To end the show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Go.  Go.  Wait.  You know, he knows what play, play us out means.  Yeah.  Sting's going to play us out.  Yeah, everyone knows what that, if you're a broadcaster, you know what that means.  You learn that in, like, college TV or college radio.  He's being obnoxious.  Five, four, three.  That's tomorrow, and that is it.  Uh-huh.  Five, four, three. 
[02:26:30]  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today, and we will leave you with a, I can't do it.  We'll do it live.  Okay.  We'll do it live.  Fuck it.  Do it live.  I can, I'll write it, and we'll do it live.  Fucking thing sucks.  In.  Five, four, three.  That's tomorrow, and that is it for us today.  I'm Bill O'Reilly.  Thanks again for watching. 
[02:27:00]  We'll leave you with Sting and a cut off his new album.  Take it away.  They didn't use that take, by the way.  You can tell.  Yeah.  He's still so angry.  He's still pissed.  When he got together.  What a douche.  He was really yelling there.  He's just a douche.  Fuck it.  Fuck it.  We got the Jack Cafferty from earlier, E-Rock?  So, Jack Cafferty had a little problem with the reading machine as well.  Did he?  Yeah.  We haven't played this in a while.  Listen to this.  Worse than Watergate.  That is how Democratic Congressman Jerry Nadler describes the actions of the Bush administration. 
[02:27:30]  When it comes, you want to scroll the prompter up so I can continue here?  No, that's backwards.  Turn it the other way.  Let me tell you something.  There's nothing worse than someone who's not operating the prompter, right?  Believe me, it's fucking enraging.  Yeah.  Just do your job.  Speaking of Jack Cafferty, Jimmy pointed out just before he went on air that he skated.  Good for him.  He should have.  No problem.  He didn't do anything wrong with those fucking scumbags right in front protesting him. 
[02:28:00]  They didn't understand what he said.  And good for CNN to not fire him.  A bunch of fucking assholes always panic.  They just let it ride out and nothing happened.  What was the original comment from him?  I forget now.  Do we have that?  He said they're the same goons and thugs that they've been for the last 50 years.  Yeah, here it is.  Yeah, you're talking about China.  As we continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poison pet food  and export jobs to places where you can pay workers a dollar a month to turn out the  stuff that we're buying from Walmart. 
[02:28:30]  So I think our relationship with China has certainly changed.  I think they're basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last  50 years.  All right, Jack.  Stand by.  I want everybody to stand by.  We have a lot more to talk about.  Fucking asshole Wolf Blitzer is.  I know.  He just laughs it off like, oh, get me in trouble.  Yeah.  It's so obvious he's talking about the Chinese government and the way they run their business  practices.  They're not Chinese people.  And they started protesting CNN and it looked like we were going to lose another broadcaster, 
[02:29:00]  but CNN hung in there.  And it looks like controversy has passed and it's over with.  And, and, uh, and these, uh, media companies should, should take a page from this, this  situation and realize, look, you just hang in there and nothing ever happens in the end.  Right?  Nothing ever happens.  That's it.  But these fucking faggots that run businesses just panic.  And they really are a bunch of pussies.  Right.  A bunch of non-men.  Um, fucking jizz bags and ties.  Something else we played over at the other side that had to be bleeped.  Uh, we got it uncensored here. 
[02:29:30]  I like that.  Uh, do you want to give it away before we play it or afterwards?  Afterwards?  Oh yeah.  I think we should guess.  All right.  Well, people were guessing this morning and it was obvious it was two choices.  It's either a slow girl or a deaf girl.  Hey, how you doing?  Guess you can't hear me, right?  I wonder how she heard about it.  That would give it away.  Oh yeah.  You know, I didn't even hear that when we first played it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Heard.  A little heard.  I didn't even hear that the first time.  What an idiot.  Okay.  Well, obviously it's a deaf girl getting, uh, getting effed. 
[02:30:00]  What are those two non-working earmuffs just nailed to the side of your fucking head?  What a dope I am.  I didn't even hear it the first time.  Hey.  How you doing?  Guess you can't hear me, right?  I wonder how she heard about us.  She can't hear, dude.  Because the word gets around.  That's what I'm saying.  Hey, how'd you hear about us?  You.  You with the dildo in your ass. 
[02:30:30]  Frankentits.  What's your name?  Huh?  What?  What's your name?  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Say, can you say whore?  Say whore.  Whore.  Say whore.  Whore.  You're a whore?  A good whore?  Okay.  You're going to throw up on my cock?  Yeah.  Okay.  Good, good girl.  They're not speaking.  There you go. 
[02:31:00]  He's pushing my ass.  Did you like it?  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  How was it?  Did you like it?  Yeah.  Yeah?  No good?  Rough?  Rough?  Yeah.  Whoa.  So do you like being a porn star?  Would you come back again?  You like us, right?  Good guys? 
[02:31:30]  The guys just suck.  Wow.  Yeah.  They just suck.  Aren't they awful?  Where do the fine folks find the deaf girl doing porn there, Thanh?  It's the first link on E-Fucked.  E-F-U-K-T dot com.  My favorite site.  Oh, she's being DP'd there, huh?  Oh, wow.  That seems to be it.  Look at that nice fucking body shape.  On the ass.  How can you tell she has a nice body from that shot, Jimmy?  Her ass and cunt.  What else is there?  But it doesn't sit down. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, sorry.  What did her scalp look like?  It's plugged up by penises.  She has a load in her face.  What a girl.  The only part of the body you can see is her taint.  I'm surprised the fucking load's not in her ears.  Maybe that would explain things.  She used to do like that little hop on the one leg you do up deep in the pool.  Hey, hey, hey.  I can hear it.  I'm fine.  That was jizzing.  Carl in Jersey.  What's up, Carl?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  Hey, hot, Carl.  I was on my way to Harrington, and I was thinking,  I thought Jimmy was supposed to be staying away from porn as best he can.  Well, I'm in the studio. 
[02:32:30]  It doesn't count.  What happened?  What did I miss?  I'm pushing my shaft.  This is work.  Yeah.  He started the show by looking at Hustler.  What's the big deal?  All right.  I just thought it was strange that he was, somebody said he was single now.  What I noticed about Jimmy going through the Hustler magazine, he goes through it very  angrily.  You were changing those pages really, really loudly, Jimmy.  What was that about?  I love Hustler.  I really do.  But you were like, whoosh.  Oh, no.  Probably just trying to find the next fucking meaty fist in panties. 
[02:33:00]  The next little turn on.  Yeah.  I love Hustler.  All right, boys.  I love you.  I'm out.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  We got a retard as a front man for a band.  Oh, right.  We never got to this.  We were supposed to get to this on Friday, but we had so much fun with Sandy Kane, we  never got to it.  So, yes, I said that last time, a retard as a front man for a band.  Yes.  Hello.  It's foundry. 
[02:33:30]  What was the Steve bit today?  Oh, him at the cuddle party.  The cuddle party.  The big bear rolling over people.  I think Steve would go to a cuddle party.  Yeah.  Of course he would.  He would like to cuddle.  Steve, would you go to a cuddle party?  He's yelling no from the back of us.  What do you got, Danny?  No means yes.  I'm just going to bring up this band's MySpace for you guys.  Oh, okay, cool.  What do you know about this guy?  Well, it's a legitimate band.  I mean, it's a disabled gentleman and his brother.  The brother plays music, and he claims he's not exploiting his brother because the brother 
[02:34:00]  has a good time, and he's on stage, and he's performing, and he likes it.  Of course he does.  He's so exploiting his own brother.  I'm sure he likes his fucking dingle lick, too.  Yeah, no kidding.  He's exploiting him.  Yeah.  And what, this was a documentary or something somewhere?  No, no.  No, this was, I think, a local Philly station got on board very late last week.  So the Philly station also exploiting the retard.  Sure.  And I bet you they...  Did they play it up like it's so special? 
[02:34:30]  It's so nice and all.  Nice.  Steve has already weighed in saying it's fake, so it must be real.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the sing...  And the sing drum is down.  Oh, my God.  As soon as she started down that road, I'm like, oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Oh, God. 
[02:35:00]  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and...  And the family photograph is spoiled.  Let's see.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  And the hair is Pete Rose's.  Damn it.  What did you have?  And the Pete Rose wig is missing.  Same thing.  Pete Rose.  You didn't tell me you knew Pete Rose.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and... 
[02:35:30]  And the tongue is fat.  Oh, shit.  All right.  People are guessing, well, Kevin from Connecticut, is it...  Is the band called System of a Downsdale?  Let's try this again, all right?  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  The metal is not really a representation of athletic ability. 
[02:36:00]  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  And the cock is monstrous.  Okay.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and...  And the new baby brother is smothered in the crib.  Oh, Jesus.  They do that sometimes. 
[02:36:30]  I understand.  Oh, God.  Oh, oh.  Oh, my...  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right, let's get through this, okay?  All right.  Got a few clips.  It's a band with a...  Well, it says right here, a retard is front man for a band.  Okay.  I'm sure that's how the news had the graphic, too.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking...  And the stomach is stapled. 
[02:37:00]  No, the band's not called Dexys Midnight Dummies.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the singer is like no one you've ever seen lead a band.  Oh, my God. 
[02:37:30]  Throw your hands in the air and wave them like you don't know where you are.  The band is called Bill.  Bill.  Because that's his name.  And more than that, it's the only word Bill can clearly write.  Throw your hands in the air and wave them like there's a fire and you don't know what to do.  Bill.  Holy shit.  He looks like Stephen King.  Like an angry Stephen King.  Oh, he really does.  Big retard head. 
[02:38:00]  How appropriate.  It.  And when he showed up, his parents had misery.  Kevin from Connecticut is on fire today.  He writes, their number one hit is called...  He kind of just punched his keyboard for the name of the song.  All right.  Back on the chart with Rolled Over on My Puppy.  It's not a rap band, Dave. 
[02:38:30]  Dave in Massachusetts.  Is the band's name LL Jewel J?  It's kind of funny, though.  All right.  He puts the mic out and lets the crowd finish the song like all the...  I put, I put...  He holds the mic out and they all go, my finger in the socket.  For an encore, he just eats pennies. 
[02:39:00]  Old copper stomach.  Oh, wow.  From their debut album, Lead Paint Chips are Yummy.  Brian in St. Louis, it's a Led Zeppelin cover band called Lead Eaton.  Oh, God.  Well, you want to try to get through this clip?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill. 
[02:39:30]  And you are...  Stupid.  Holy shit.  Tim H. from Columbus, Ohio.  Does that retard realize that isn't a guitar he's holding?  It's a dead squirrel.  Or it's not plugged in?  They just let him flub with it? 
[02:40:00]  And moron enjoy it?  The name of their album is called American Idiot.  All right, come on.  Let's see what...  Let me go all the way back because I missed something there.  Members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill.  And you are...  A disappointment.  All right, we shouldn't do that. 
[02:40:30]  That's right.  Let's play the clip.  Yeah, all right.  Let me back it up a little bit here.  Hold on a minute.  Okay.  All right.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill.  And you are...  Not Pete Rose.  Let's hear the real clip.  This is just not Rose.  Yeah, it's silly.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill. 
[02:41:00]  And you are...  Still in kindergarten.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill.  And you are...  A problem Doc Martin should have solved.  John in Virginia writes,  Instead of lighters, everyone holds up hangers. 
[02:41:30]  Come on, let's get to the clip.  Yeah, we've got to get through it, I guess, huh?  Ah, Dan in New York City.  The Eagles are smarter than me.  All right, let's play this clip.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill.  And you are...  Now detectable through a sonogram.  Oh my God, Eric Shaw writes, 
[02:42:00]  And you are...  Not on the album cover.  All right, let's play this, please.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  Typical fodder for this predictable radio show. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, fuck.  Denny from Philly writes,  Their mom wanted to change the name of the band to Kill Bill.  Holy shit.  All right, you want to hear the clip?  Yes, I want to call it.  You guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  Bill.  You're Bill.  I am.  Bill, you're a singer. 
[02:43:00]  The band Bill named after Bill Gates.  Bill Gates, not just because that's his first name,  but because it's one of the few words he can write clearly,  and that certainly comes in handy...  I wrote a song.  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.  They just play the music.  He sings like...  Bill, Bill.  Bill, Bill, Bill.  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill.  Bill, Bill.  It's my new song.  I just wrote it.  Bill's a fucking lunkhead. 
[02:43:30]  They hold up their lighters for Freebird,  and he screams and hides behind the amplifiers.  Bill, lunkhead.  Yeah, he sees the lighters and thinks the pitchforks are coming next.  Stupid Bill.  Oh, Bill's a lunkhead.  Bill, Bill, he is.  Gotta set up one more here.  What a booze.  Fucking lunkhead.  Great word.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are... 
[02:44:00]  I like to make werewolf movies.  See, they're fucking...  They're switched.  It should have been this one.  I am the werewolf.  Yeah, we gotta redo that.  Just wreck the whole bit.  Give me a pen.  All right, we'll go to track two.  Have a pen, seriously.  It's labeled the wrong.  It just wrecked the bit.  Oh.  No.  Oh, you want me to go back there?  I was just looking for something. 
[02:44:30]  You don't have it?  I don't think it's there.  Here, just switch those two.  Those two are wrong.  Just white it out.  All right, you want the next track here?  Band plays clubs and has put out some CDs.  Let's find out about this.  Oh, God.  I am a singer, yeah.  You are a singer.  Did you always love to sing?  I am a singer.  Bill has Down syndrome.  Really?  Does he? 
[02:45:00]  Jesus fucking Christ, you idiot.  Boy, aren't you the sharp one.  Oh, my God.  He does.  No, really?  Look at that picture of him.  Wow.  Holy shit, let me see that picture.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He looks like a trout with glasses.  Why do you need glasses, really?  Hey, Doc Ock is fucking singing in a band.  Fucking Bill has that one.  What else are you going to tell?  Bill is not a math professor.  Really?  We thought he was on a six-month bender. 
[02:45:30]  Holy shit.  He has Downs, you idiot.  Maybe Bill is a math professor.  One handful of pennies plus one mouth equals stomach aching.  By the way, they're just doing a South Park bit.  This is Timmy.  Yeah.  They're just doing South Park.  Bill's a fool.  Okay.  Bill is the quintessential Claude. 
[02:46:00]  Claude.  Holy shit.  And he has glasses, too.  Jesus Christ.  The head doesn't work and neither do the eyes.  Did God give this kid anything?  Probably has orthopedic shoes.  Fucking a little dick.  A little dick.  Yeah.  We get it, God.  You don't like Bill.  Oh, fuck.  He fucked Bill over.  Jesus Christ.  God didn't even give him lips.  Who are Bill's parents?  Look at him.  Is he in a cape?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's in a cape.  Oh, my God. 
[02:46:30]  He's probably in a fine restaurant.  Stupid man.  He put the tablecloth on trying to fly through Tavern in the Green.  Excuse me.  You're going to have to put your thing back in the chair.  Bill has Downs.  Oh, the audience doesn't really seem to know quite what to make of it all.  Big Brother John has always been in bed.  Spider-brain.  Spider-brain.  He's got a little cape. 
[02:47:00]  He's a superhero.  Spider-brain.  Spider-brain.  Look.  Thinks whatever.  Spider-cane.  Look.  Able to debate with a rock or tree stump.  It's stupid man.  Spider-man.  Spider-man.  Does whatever.  Spider-man.  Yes, Bill.  Spins a web.  And he's on.  All right.  Here we go. 
[02:47:30]  Big Brother John has always been in bands.  Music was always around the house.  And that love for music rubbed off on Bill at an early age.  We'd always hear crazy stuff coming out of it.  Holy shit.  That picture makes him look like Tom Likus.  Oh, my God.  Tom Likus is the lead singer.  Tom Likus is a mongoloid.  He's the lead singer of Bill.  They put masks on the other members of the band.  Of course they do.  But no mask required for Bill.  He's got his own built-in mask.  Yes.  God-given mask. 
[02:48:00]  He's actually wearing one.  He's the lead character from Dumbbell.  It's just the costume box just said Claude on it.  I love that word.  He really is a buffoon.  A fucking blithering idiot.  A numbskull.  A tremendous numbskull.  Oh, fuck.  He'd always hear crazy stuff coming out of his room. 
[02:48:30]  He'd be putting on little skits and playing records and singing along.  The band plays out at clubs all over New England.  Now they're on YouTube, MySpace.  They've released a couple of CDs.  After a show, when we get back in the car,  he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  Shut up.  Nothing.  The first thing he usually says is...  Nothing worse than a babbling pea brain.  Oh, oh, oh.  Here we go.  The first thing he says...  The first thing he usually says...  There it comes.  So bad.  Backed up.  The first thing he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking. 
[02:49:00]  And the first thing he usually says is...  Anyone need a spare chromosome?  Get back in the car.  The first thing he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  And the first thing he usually says is...  Did mom drink during pregnancy?  Oh, my God.  Get back in the car. 
[02:49:30]  The first thing he gets a chatterbox.  He's usually talking, talking, talking.  And the first thing he usually says is...  I want to do that again.  Why is that funny?  Really?  It's usually the first thing he says after he shits his pants, too.  Or eats a donut.  Fucking kicks a small animal.  Rapes the neighbor.  I want to do that again.  I want to do that again. 
[02:50:00]  But there's no doubt for people with children who have Down syndrome,  Bill is a total inspiration.  And they just think it's awesome.  His dream was to join a band and be a rockhead.  That's been really wonderful.  That's actually probably been my favorite response of all. 
[02:50:30]  They just say this really just gives me hope that...  That we, too, can get our thing out of the house.  When my daughter grows up, that if she has something that she really loves to do,  that she might have the chance to actually do it, too.  You know, in a big way.  There's no pretension at all.  He just connects directly with the audience.  He's right with them.  Yeah.  Spitting on them.  What, are they all on heroin or something? 
[02:51:00]  Jeez.  What the fuck?  I don't mean to be so harsh.  We're just kidding.  You know what, though?  Well, we're absolutely exploiting the little fella, but the news is acting like this is a real good thing.  Stop.  They're exploiting the hell out of the guy.  And they really sense that.  They really get it.  You know, he grabs...  His head is a drum.  And he doesn't want to let go.  Beat him up the head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome. 
[02:51:30]  Bill.  You're my new favorite.  Oh, shut up.  He's not.  He is not.  Lucy in the sky with Dummy.  He's not going to fucking...  Yeah, she's not going to listen to his CDs.  Right.  You're my new favorite.  Really?  Really.  You're going to fucking fill your iPod with his fucking...  Droning?  Droning banality?  She's going to have an iPod filled with Coldplay and Bill.  Sure.  Yeah. 
[02:52:00]  Awesome.  Bill.  You're my new favorite.  New favorite.  That was awesome.  Awesome.  Good job.  Awesome.  Awesome.  Thank you.  You were great.  That was awesome.  As he just grabs her tit like a chimp.  He doesn't know it's wrong.  Oh, he's got a fucking cowboy hat on like Lemmy and big glasses.  Oh, yeah.  He's a rock star, Jimmy.  Come on.  Yeah, look at him go.  Look at him walking down the stairs very carefully.  Yeah.  Well, you want to hear My Heart and All My Life by the band Bill? 
[02:52:30]  More than I want to breathe.  I want to hear that.  Here we go.  Some Bill.  Here is Bill.  That sound should have been the abortion machine.  I hear some gentle scraping on a womb wall.  That's me with the mother going, make sure you get it all. 
[02:53:00]  I don't want one scrap of dummy left.  Oh, God.  Now it's just awful.  Now it's just horrible.  Oh, fuck.  It's going to be right.  So not fucking right.  Oh, my God.  We got a GWAR reference today.  Holy shit.  Mike in Jersey, what's up?  Yo, man.  What's up, fellas? 
[02:53:30]  This dude could be on GWAR and not wear a costume, man.  Very nice.  That's all I got.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tony in New York.  Tony.  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning.  He's a real rock star.  His tour bus is a short bus.  He's hooked on Ritalin and Jelly Beans, and his groupies consist of stuffed animals and  girls who wear hockey helmets at a normal amount of time.  Bravo.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Here we go.  Bill.  Bill.  American Idol. 
[02:54:00]  That would scare him if he heard that. 
[02:54:30]  Ghosts.  Oh.  What the hell is he singing about?  Oh, man. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, man.  Yes, stupid.  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, man.  What do you hear me?  Why is he there?  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[02:55:30]  That is...  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That's awful.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Do it! 
[02:56:00]  I made a gas!  I made a gas!  Shut up! Shut up!  Shut up! Stop it!  Stop it!  Quiet.  Stop whining.  This sucks. 
[02:56:30]  This sucks.  This sucks.  Wow.  That was really bad.  I had higher hopes for him.  That's the band Bill.  There you go.  Wonderful.  We're going to take our first break.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  God, do we pound those into the ground, don't we?  How can you not, though?  It's such an easy target.  But it's still funny.  Richard Harden, Wizard of Oz, Richard Harden band guy.  How do you not tease him?  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe?  Hey, who was that?  No, should have died young?  Later.  All right.  Let's go to Rick in Rockland County.  Rick.  No, it's Rick.  All right.  Whatever.  What's up?  Get a hold of yourself, Rick. 
[02:57:30]  My bad.  Hey, when did Brian Wilson change his name to Bill?  Yeah.  Got a little of the Brian Wilson in him.  Ryan Redding, what's up?  Hey, I was wondering if Bill took mumbling lessons from Eddie Vedder.  Yeah, someone suggested we play Bill or Bob Dylan.  Yeah, that's true.  Chris, Red Bank, New Jersey.  What's up?  All right.  Thank you.  Time of my life.  Oh, we got more songs?  No, no.  That's just...  Oh, here's the names of the songs.  No, no, no.  What? 
[02:58:00]  Because it's this show, we have other just retarded chestnuts we can trot out, like the  time of my life and other retarded things.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I can share.  To go to break.  Is there an album out?  Let's get these CDs.  Which one do you want to play?  Those are the classics.  Yeah, those are the classics.  Well, we got Time of My Life.  We've played that a lot.  What a Wonderful World, Achy Breaky Heart, or...  What a Wonderful World.  True.  Or Iron Maiden.  Which one do you want to play, Danny?  Going into a break.  I mean, it's not on the list, but... 
[02:58:30]  It's not on the list, but I was kind of hoping to hear the Insects song.  I haven't heard that in forever.  That's a fucking joke.  What is it?  All right, we'll play that a little later.  I'd like to hear...  I want to hear What a Wonderful World, I think, right?  Any of those would be great.  All right, let's do What a Wonderful World as we go to break.  Why don't you sing that?  I know.  I know.  It's a sweet dream, so green.  We're all in tune.  I see it blue.  Happy and you are taking care of myself. 
[02:59:00]  What a wonderful world.  Happy and you are taking care of yourself. 
[02:59:30]  The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky, are also on the faces of people going by.  I see them shaking hands, saying, how do you do? 
[03:00:00]  They're really saying, I love you.  They're really saying, I love you.  I love you.  My faith is good.  We're washing road.  The world's not strong.  I'll never know.  And I'm thinking myself.  What a wonderful world. 
[03:00:30]  And I'm thinking myself.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking myself.  What a wonderful world.  What a wonderful world.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Talking about TV and what females make us laugh during the break. 
[03:01:00]  What's the Shary of Terry movie that was really bad?  I saw that in a theater somewhere.  I was on the road in Florida.  No, it was called the, um...  I don't know, Jimmy.  I don't know.  We're talking about women that make us laugh.  And, uh, Amy Poehler makes me laugh.  Carol Burnett.  What?  I don't know which one it is. 
[03:01:30]  Sorry.  It's the...  No, that's the anthony.  Park.  Southland Tales.  Steven's Life.  Smile.  Surviving Eden.  She made all those?  Yeah.  Dumb and Dumberer.  Oh, maybe it wasn't her I'm thinking of.  No, she had her own little, uh, movie vehicle.  After SNL.  You thinking about Molly Shannon?  Yeah.  What was her movie?  Oh, Molly Shannon was Superstar.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's the one.  That was awful, right?  Yeah.  Uh, earlier this morning, we got a bunch of things to do. 
[03:02:00]  We got, uh, Laszlo turned us all on to a bit.  He did it on a Saturday Night Virus.  Um, and, uh, he said we could go with it.  Dirty Potter.  Did he do?  Holy shit.  No, he found something.  He did a little bit of it, uh, on his show.  And then he said, guys, you gotta play this on your show.  So, we got that coming up in a minute or two.  We got an Alec Baldwin, um, talking about the voicemail he left for his daughter.  We didn't do that yet.  And we got Anthony who got, uh, clocked going 95 in a, in a 55 yesterday.  Uh, yesterday.  Got a ticket.  Got his first ticket in a long time, right?  Grr. 
[03:02:30]  Not happy about it.  Eh, well, what are you gonna do?  You play the game.  Yeah.  And sometimes you get caught.  Listen to the replay.  We did about an hour on it today.  But, um, Derek came up with this.  Well, it finally happened.  I got a ticket.  I called you the bandit.  I finally got, uh, yeah.  I finally got it.  Got pulled over last night, driving home.  And, uh, yeah. 
[03:03:00]  I got a 95 in a 55.  You wear no man's chains.  Oof.  Oof.  Oof.  Some say they despise.  95 miles an hour.  You know, God forbid you hit somebody.  And the arrogance.  With all your cash.  Yep.  You know, you think you're an Indy car driver.  I mean, you should be embarrassed.  I bet they wish they were you.  You shouldn't have those things in the first place. 
[03:03:30]  What?  I would give you double the pickup.  This, this is, this one is a biggie.  You gotta, like, slow down just a little bit there, Anthony.  You gotta, you gotta be aware of the signs.  Not only do you have to pay the fine, you gotta pay the state for the privilege of keeping  your license.  You're at risk of losing your license, my friend.  God damn, I can't, I can't lose my license.  You had it coming your way, buddy.  You were pushing in everybody's face how you were getting off the hook.  I wasn't pushing anything in anyone's face.  I was trying to drive home. 
[03:04:00]  I'm really grateful he did what he did.  Shut up, mister, and educate me.  No, no, educate me.  We're trying to slow me down.  Listen to the signs.  They're all around you.  Come on.  Who's going home?  I, uh, intro'd that by saying a production piece from, uh, Derek.  I wanna, I wanna thank Derek for being able to push play on two different machines at the same time.  That's just amazing.  Just amazing.  Abilities from, uh, Derek in the production room.  That's right.  Basically, start song, start audio of Anthony talking about speeding tape. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  Just brilliant production from, uh, the one, the only, Derek.  Wow.  And attention get it.  He was actually-  Check off those mandals and get to work.  Yeah, he actually was able to push play with his right index finger and his left index finger at the same time.  And he even said, ah, fuck it.  Let Anthony talk over the vocals.  Yeah.  He started off nice where, like, Anthony was sneaking in a little bit here in between the vocals.  Yeah, but then he just got lazy.  Then he's like, ah, fuck it.  People will get the point. 
[03:05:00]  And then the other part of that which makes me laugh is Jimmy's whole thing going, yup.  Just agreeing with the, with the callers that are just killing Anthony on his feet.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Told him.  That's right.  What a dick.  Guy's making a point where obviously Anthony's gonna lose his mind and Jimmy goes, yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup.  Yup. 
[03:05:30]  Is that duty cam?  That was amazing though.  Very good.  I love duty cam.  What?  I love a good toilet cam.  I mean, up.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Oh my god.  That's a nice picture.  Fuck yeah.  Girl on the pisser.  Hopefully she's shitting.  You like girls on the toilet pictures?  Who does?  I'm not a big fan.  It's not like my, my specialty, but I like just the, I like the panties.  Around the ankle?  pulled down, yeah. Around the ankles, that's not  that bad. That a bad.  I like a girl laying on the floor by the toilet  with a log hanging out.  Like she fell off. 
[03:06:00]  Why would she fall off?  She's really pretty, but she had a stroke while making a duty  and she fell off the ball with a log still half in.  Holy shit.  That's kind of a specific fetish.  Yes.  Dot com.  Stroke with half a log dot com.  Very tough to get genuine ones.  For the whole half of the body to shut down.  This is fake.  Alright, before we get to Dirty Potter, we're going to do Alec Baldwin  talking about the voicemail he left his young daughter there.  A long time ago.  He was on 60 Minutes and he has finally 
[03:06:30]  broken his silence now that his daughter  is like 22 or something.  Jesus. How about you do this like when it first  happened? I've got to ask you about  that notorious phone call  you made.  How would you do that?  You get so frustrated  and you realize, number one,  and it's wrong, it's totally  wrong, that I was really speaking to  somebody else when I left that message.  I mean, I was pissed.  I've been putting up with this  for six years.  Yeah, he hates his wife, 
[03:07:00]  obviously, huh?  Oh, yeah.  We don't need the original voicemail.  Everyone's heard that by now.  I'm hoping.  I'm hoping that.  But you weren't talking to another person.  You were talking to your daughter,  to a kid.  You said, you thoughtless little pig.  I mean, I find it hard to  hear the words.  Did you ever lose your temper with your kids?  Yeah, but  nothing like that.  If you're asking me,  do I feel bad about leaving that message,  I think that goes without saying.  At the same time,  I'm pretty overwhelmed by the 
[03:07:30]  sanctimoniousness of people  who say that...  I mean, I got so many phone calls  from people.  Wait a second, though.  I got so many phone calls from people  who seem as  learned and sober  and together as you are  who all said to me,  man, I'm glad they didn't tape  some of the things I said to my kids.  Good for him.  I like Alec Baldwin.  God damn it, I like him.  I don't remember what I said originally,  but absolutely this happened.  I made an ass  of myself.  Yeah.  The greatest line. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's made an ass of himself.  Good for him.  Parents lose their minds all the time,  but they're not celebrities.  Parents say some awful things.  What was the worst thing  your parents said to you?  I asked this not knowing the answer  in my own life, unfortunately,  but I'll think about it.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  It's our secret.  Oh, jeez.  That's a bad one.  Yep.  As appalling as what you said may be, 
[03:08:30]  even more appalling  was that it was released by someone.  But that tells you  what I'm dealing with.  But, you know, listen,  you use words like appalled  and you have, if I may say so,  a pretty judgmental tone of me.  I think that as truly sorry  as I am that that happened,  to me, it only illustrates  how difficult this process  has become for many, many people.  For me, he's just dealing  with one of those divorces  where the kid gets in the middle,  unfortunately, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This ambassador's probably 
[03:09:00]  a fucking cunt on wheels.  Oh.  Good for him, though,  to tell that old bag  that he's fucking being...  Who is that?  Morley Safer?  What does it sound like?  Morley.  Yeah.  Hey, Morley.  Was it Morley?  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  You ever wonder?  Hey.  We gotta do what's-his-name again.  Yeah.  What is his name?  What's my name?  Can we get more Andy Rooney audio  of him just talking about  the dumbest things?  Babbling about something stupid.  You ever wonder?  You ever notice?  He called her a little pig.  Is she a little pig? 
[03:09:30]  Is your ex-wife a cunt?  Some wives can be cunts.  That's the bit.  That's the bit right there.  Well, where's Danny?  I want him to explain...  Oh, somebody wants to talk  about the Chinese earthquake.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  We'll probably get fired for this.  Ed in Pittsburgh, what's up?  Hey, Ope.  I was just calling in.  I wanted to see if you guys  heard about the earthquake 
[03:10:00]  that happened over in China  this morning.  7.8.  Here we go.  Yes, we did.  And also, I had one more thing  to leave for Ope.  I was in your studio  earlier on this year  to appear on the Ron and Fez show.  I remember Ope told me  Sidney Crosby's not having  such a great year this year.  Fuck the Islanders.  All right.  Let's dissect that call  a little bit.  He just asked if we heard  about the earthquake.  No, I mean, he was...  Dude, if you want to call up 
[03:10:30]  and say, you know,  I was wrong, Crosby rocks,  fuck the Islanders,  just say that's why you're calling.  Yeah.  That's the beauty of this show.  You don't have to, like,  make believe you want to talk  about the dumb Chinese earthquake.  Dumb earthquake.  Sorry, I didn't mean to say that.  Oh, my God.  7.8, though.  You know, we got six...  We have six flat screens  in this area of the studio.  Every TV had a different disaster.  We had the tornadoes in Missouri.  We had the 7.8 earthquake  in China over there.  We had the...  What else?  Oh, the volcano. 
[03:11:00]  Volcano and then the monsoon.  That's a half-time show.  I have to go to a cuddle party now.  Yeah.  Our only chance at network TV  and, boy, did we blow it.  That sure sucked being on a show  that lasted one season.  Yeah.  How humiliating.  We didn't even last a season, Anthony.  Yeah.  We were penciled in for 12. 
[03:11:30]  I think we made six.  Ouch.  No, I think we made four, I think.  Four out of eight.  That's what it was.  And also the cyclone aftermath.  Yeah.  We're all on TVs at the same time.  It would make a great montage  for the next time they want to talk  about global warming.  Yep.  And what it's doing to our planet.  Or Armageddon.  What's up with the 7.8?  That's a pretty strong one.  Over there in China.  They're saying maybe 5,000 dead  in one county alone.  They're showing like just a chandelier 
[03:12:00]  like moving from side to side.  Wow.  That really shows you the power  of a 7.8 earthquake right there, huh?  Showing a chandelier just moving around.  Glass of water tipped over.  Yeah.  Did you get your chandelier hooked up in?  Oh, not yet.  Okay.  That's going to happen soon.  All right.  Big, ridiculous chandelier.  Yes.  Danny, what's Dirty Potter about?  Laszlo turned me on to this on Saturday night.  It's basically how all books have  the audio tape version.  Perfect.  Of them. 
[03:12:30]  So somebody went through  all of the Harry Potter audio books  and terribly edited words together  to make just awful horrific things.  But like in the context of a story.  Okay.  How many people read them?  Was it one person did the whole book or no?  Like the audio was done by the author?  No, no.  I think it's all done by the same person.  I'm assuming.  Yeah.  I want to thank Laszlo for this.  Yeah.  Big props to Laszlo.  Turning us on to Dirty Potter.  And Ron beat it in Hermione's hair. 
[03:13:00]  I'll be 17 in two and a bit months time,  said Ron grumpily.  And then I'll be able to do it by magic.  There was a pause while Harry continued  to pound Hermione's bloody fudge,  which he had done several times.  What the fuck?  Her bloody fudge.  What the hell, man?  He pounds Hermione's bloody fudge.  To even think of it,  putting that together is hysterical.  He's like listening and going,  fudge, I could use that.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, 
[03:13:30]  he's just like labeling,  titling like these drops that he's putting.  He's just like,  fudge.  I'll just cut that for fudge.  I'll use that  because I can use that  for asshole or shit or something.  All right.  Bloody fudge.  Wow, this is a very good question.  Mike in Maryland.  Mike.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, question for you.  How come you're now allowed  to imitate a Chinese voice on the radio,  but on TV,  Amy Poehler did the little Chinese  indiate on Temple of Doom?  Wait, was it on this week's SNL? 
[03:14:00]  Yes.  Give me that audio.  I'm going to play it on the other side  and force them to just dump out of the bit  to prove a point tomorrow.  I'll tell you why.  Because the lawyers who work for one company  are slightly less pussy-ish  than the lawyers who work for another company.  That's listening to himself there.  Bonus lawyers.  They dumped out a boner today on the other side?  Boner.  Boner.  Boner.  That's really dirty.  Unbelievable.  All right, let's get back to Dirty Potter.  to pound Hermione's bloody fudge, 
[03:14:30]  which he had done several times to Ron already.  Ron ejaculated cum the size of a great...  What the hell, dude?  How did he make that happen?  How did he get ejaculated?  He got ejaculated.  I've never read the books.  I don't know if that word has ever come up in the books.  That's a statement.  Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't think they used the word ejaculated  in Harry Potter.  Must be Jack  with, uh...  Wow, that's...  All right.  Fudge,  which he had done several times to Ron already. 
[03:15:00]  Ron ejaculated cum  the size of a grapefruit.  Dumbledore's thick cum  flew out of the pulsating top  and whipped through the air.  Faggots,  said Snape.  Professor Umbridge seemed to decide  that she could ignore the fat cunt warts no longer.  Oh, this guy's gonna be so shut down  by that bitch.  Oh, that's funny.  Uh, coming up,  XM and Syria is still at the altar. 
[03:15:30]  On CNBC,  they're doing a little report on  what's going on with the merger.  Yeah, that means nothing.  Fuck, dude.  Still at the altar.  What a waste of fucking time.  Really?  Could you imagine, like, the,  you know, the new gadgets  we would have had by now?  Oh, forget about it.  Flying cars.  Production has just stopped.  I mean, just in the satellite radio world.  Whoa.  Marketing has stopped.  What a waste of fucking time.  It'll pick up nicely, though,  once it happens.  Whenever, 
[03:16:00]  I remember December,  December, any day.  Guys, you gotta be,  you know,  extra,  extra careful  because this merger's going down  before the end of the year  and we don't want any real issues,  so just play it safe.  Play it safe.  If you got any vacation time,  take it now  because we don't want you guys  screwing up before the merger happens.  That was December.  Now we're five months later.  It's May.  More Dirty Potter.  This guy's, uh,  I don't know what he's  trying to do today.  Opie, you asshole.  What the hell does an earthquake,  volcano, 
[03:16:30]  and tornadoes  have to do with global warming?  You're a radio jock.  A lot of people would say,  because of course,  they say that all the time.  More of this shit is happening.  Dummy.  Ugh.  Not about the chapter, no,  said Hermione.  Well,  we'll jerk in just now,  said Professor Umbridge,  showing her slightly damp,  moldy smelling cunt.  Harry stared.  Fucking Laszlo finds the shit.  Slightly damp,  moldy smelling cunt. 
[03:17:00]  I hear that again.  And someone is saying  that ejaculate  is in the Harry Potter books.  Yeah.  I would assume  they would just maybe,  like,  get a thesaurus  and use a different word for that.  Professor Umbridge,  showing her slightly damp,  moldy smelling cunt.  Harry stared at it.  Ron kept spurting cum  in a pool of his own poo,  as though hoping  to pick up ten-year-olds.  If you have other queries,  we can deal with them  at the end of jerking off.  I've got a query  about sucking  your bloody behind, 
[03:17:30]  warts,  said Hermione.  Professor Umbridge  raised her head behind,  and was now shitting  butt explosion.  Poo!  On her face.  Harry touched  sack warts,  and Ron beat it  furiously in his fingers,  then closed them again  with a jerk.  Oh my god.  Can we get more of these?  There's like,  God,  there's like ten minutes  of this.  I tried to give you,  I tried to give you,  like,  the best.  We need more tomorrow  if you can find it.  That's funny, man.  I think,  I think people are having, 
[03:18:00]  I think people are having  a Monday out there.  The only tragedy is  you guys all fawning  over that Baldwin faggot.  You're losing it.  How are we losing it  by understanding?  How are we fawning  over him because we  like the fact that he  didn't take any shit  for the interviewer?  Yeah,  he kind of stood up  for himself.  He called him out  on his shitty tone.  That was definitely.  And he fucking,  everyone has yelled at their kids.  Poo!  That's the bad part.  Yeah.  Can you play that part again?  Yeah,  the guy's wrecking our buzz, 
[03:18:30]  man.  We're having fun  with this dirty part.  I'll get to the whole  clip again.  Not about the chapter.  You know,  said Hermione.  You're right,  Jimmy.  Fuck that.  We'll jerk in just now.  Be back off for the day.  Said Professor Umbridge,  showing her slightly damp,  moldy smelling cunt.  Harry stared at it.  Ron kept spurting cum  in a pool of his own poo,  as though hoping to pick up  ten-year-olds.  If you have other queries,  we can deal with them  at the end of jerking off.  I've got a query about  sucking your bloody  behind warts, 
[03:19:00]  said Hermione.  Professor Umbridge raised  her tied behind  and was now shitting  butt explosion.  Poo!  On her face.  Poo!  Harry touched sack warts  and Ron beat it furiously  in his fingers,  then closed them again  with a jerk.  That's fucking great.  Is that actually  from the book all that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Have they ended that?  Oh, they have.  Yeah.  Jesus, Jimmy.  I don't know how  I feel so like in Harry Potter.  By the way, Jimmy,  see?  Following your advice, 
[03:19:30]  look at that.  Nothing but meters  going up and down  instead of instant  feedback to read.  I like the old days  they would just hand  a paper with some  funny ones on it  because now there's  just too many fucking  haters that know  that they can have  shit read directly.  Yeah, there's a lot of  haters that have,  they're just not fans  of the show.  You don't think  we're stupid, do you?  Yeah.  Come on.  One guy who's  kind of funny  I was telling Anthony  too, a hater.  Probably one of the  better segments  we did this morning,  really funny, 
[03:20:00]  a lot of interaction  with the listeners  and it was just  rocking.  We were in the zone  and someone like  writes,  oh, this is  Hack Radio,  last hour sucked.  And I go to Ann,  I'm like,  these dopes,  like, if I was  going to be a hater,  I would wait.  Look, I'm even  going to give you  some advice.  Wait for the show  to suck.  All right,  right now.  A big one  and then write that.  Right now.  But obviously this guy  doesn't even listen to the show  and he's just typing away  wherever the fuck he is,  assuming he's going to  like get to it.  It's like dope. 
[03:20:30]  We know we were just  killing.  More dirty potter,  Jimmy?  Please.  I don't like the type  of language,  but I'll tell you.  All right,  here we go.  An enormous fat tit,  said Harry,  tugging very hard on it.  He hardened instantly.  Dumbledore was watching him  and was now sucking on it  long and hard.  I don't like fat girls much,  said Harry,  who could not think  what else to say.  It was not the sucking  that intrigued him.  He had watched Malfoy  stuffed into a miniature  tutu do that to Snape  for a long time. 
[03:21:00]  It was the fact  that Snape did,  after all,  murder Dumbledore.  I've always thought  there might be something  going on between them,  said Hermione.  Oh,  he's the world's  biggest haggart,  said Snape.  There was a short silence  in which Ron ejaculated  cum,  and the little laugh.  They're all cumming.  Shitting and cumming  and sucking bloody  ass words.  You can hear they  cheated with faggot.  It sounds like 
[03:21:30]  fucking Joshua  in War Games.  Joshua?  What do you mean faggot?  They probably put  two words together.  Yeah, exactly.  But that's one of the more.  Mongo the Trucker  has a problem  with Dirty Potter 2.  Mongo!  Yeah,  you guys question  whether the word  ejaculate is in there,  but you don't question  that he says  the word cunt?  Well,  that could be  the beginning of country.  Or cunt.  Oh my god,  yeah,  exactly.  In the country,  cunt.  Yeah,  it would work.  Alright,  here's another one. 
[03:22:00]  Dirty Potter.  Professor Umbridge  smiling still more widely,  fucking ejaculated on him.  Ron,  on the other hand,  pleased himself.  Hermione ejaculated.  Ron ejaculated.  Harry groaned.  Harry drew closer  to Hermione  and said,  golden shower.  Hermione raised  her eyebrows.  Pass me a bowl.  Said Hermione.  Professor Umbridge  ejaculated on Harry  for a moment  with a look of disgust  on her face.  Meanwhile,  Ron,  who was attempting  to burst 
[03:22:30]  by putting both hands  on it,  standing up  and squashing it  as hard as he could  and wiping cum  from his face,  stuffing wet  but still grinning,  said angrily,  who wants eggnog?  Fine to the heart,  man.  Oh god damn,  is that funny?  It is that funny.  Bunch of fucking  immature assholes.  But it is fucking funny.  Wow.  Alright, 
[03:23:00]  one more for today?  Alright.  You gotta find a few more,  Danny,  if you can.  I will do my best.  Try.  For tomorrow.  Oh god.  Here's one more though.  Harry thrust his fist  in Hermione  again.  Ron ejaculated  through his butt  with Dumbledore  watching him  sucking up  goblets of  farty cum.  Harry and Hermione  immediately joined in  enthusiastically,  tugging very hard  on it  to extricate  his sperm.  Harry could smell  farty black,  but  Professor Umbridge  promptly ejaculated  again. 
[03:23:30]  Oh my god.  There's so many  people cumming,  ejaculating,  jerking.  Everybody's in the mouth.  Everybody loves  cum on the face.  They all help each other.  Men with women,  women with boys,  girls with fucking chicks.  No one cares.  Yeah.  There's shit involved.  Shit,  mouthful sploge,  kids,  bloody asshole warts.  I love this fucking  golden shower.  The golden shower.  He asked if she wants one.  Oh shit.  Your hair looks like  shit, Sam.  Yeah.  Why don't you 
[03:24:00]  shave that thing?  You told me I couldn't.  Oh yeah.  Hey, you got the  Orson Welles.  I want to give  Loose Fusion  another play,  another spin today,  Anthony.  Orson Welles,  outtakes we've been  playing?  Yeah.  Just a couple of  moans and groans.  Well,  Loose Fusion  took that  and made this.  That's really good. 
[03:24:30]  You see Suge Knight  got knocked out?  Holy crap.  What's that about?  What the fuck is that about?  He was in a club in L.A.,  I guess.  Someone's going to get shot.  And someone at Suge  was like,  where's my money  or something?  And they start a huge fight  and the guy  that knocked out  Suge with a hook,  he got his ass 
[03:25:00]  handed to him.  But before he,  you know,  he went down,  he was able to land,  it seems like a pretty  lucky punch.  Knocked him out cold  for three minutes.  That ain't a lucky punch.  If you hit Suge Knight  hard enough to knock him  out for three minutes,  that's a hard hit.  You guys may have a boxer.  It looked like a really  ugly melee.  It's on TMZ.com.  You can see them  helping Suge Knight  all bloody into a car.  Did his friends...  That is not going to end  well for some people.  Did his friends beat...  Well, the other guy  will get a lot of respect.  You knocked Suge out.  Fuck that.  Get respect, huh?  Yeah, of course. 
[03:25:30]  Did his friends beat the man up?  What does the story say?  Beat the man up.  What does it say,  Than?  I can't read that far.  Exclusive photos.  These were yellow, too,  with blood on it.  Suge should have had a red shirt  on it.  It wouldn't have been as bad,  but that fucking yellow,  it's like,  that's the worst color.  Yep.  Never talk shit in yellow.  As we first reported,  Suge was at Shag Nightclub  when he began arguing  with the man  he had been talking with.  Our spy overheard Suge say,  I want my money. 
[03:26:00]  Suge and his peeps  beat the guy to the ground,  but the man landed  a right hook on Suge's face,  knocking him out  for around three minutes.  Jesus.  I want my money.  Oh, my God.  That ain't gonna end well.  That's right.  I want my money.  What am I, a cigarette?  Fuck them,  fuck them in his ear,  that cigarette hijacking Mick.  I want my fucking money.  We mentioned it.  Today.  Today.  We mentioned Andy Rooney.  Yeah.  We got some Andy Rooney  shitting on the gifts  people send him,  and he had to do  a whole segment on this. 
[03:26:30]  Shitting on gifts.  We're starting to,  literally,  we're starting to get  obsessed with Andy Rooney.  A lot of friendly people  send me things.  It's nice of them,  I guess,  but most of it's junk  that I don't want.  I have my own junk  I like to send to them.  A fan went to the trouble  of getting my picture  on this box of Wheaties.  Isn't that just what  everyone has always wanted?  Their picture  on a box of Wheaties?  To tell you the truth,  I prefer cornflakes  or shredded wheat  to Wheaties anyway.  That's some gratitude,  you old cocksucker. 
[03:27:00]  What a waste of TV time  this guy is.  The guy,  like,  listener will send you  something,  or a viewer.  Yeah.  And if you hate it,  you just fucking throw it away.  Who cares?  It's not like you  start bitching about,  oh wait,  we do.  We could send some  weird stuff ourselves.  Maybe we could do  a whole segment.  I only enjoy everything,  I guess.  Yeah, absolutely.  Usually red,  white,  and black.  It's very thoughtful.  Yes.  Yes.  This is a model  of a sunbeam tiger  someone sent me  because they know  I have a real one. 
[03:27:30]  I've had it since 1966.  I did something  about umbrellas  a while back,  and I got a lot  of special umbrellas  in the mail.  Umbrellas are sort of fun.  It's a good feeling  to think they're  keeping you dry,  even though they aren't  really very good  when it rains.  Maybe this one  would work.  What?  A man named  Richard Costura  doesn't like the way  people tell time,  and he's built  his own clock.  This may be accurate,  but I'd have a hard time  strapping Mr. Costura's  clock to my wrist. 
[03:28:00]  I don't want to know  what time it is  that bad anyway.  Tick tock.  No kidding.  As time ticks on.  I mentioned a restaurant  in Miami called  Joe's Stone Crab  quite a while ago,  and they sent me  two $100 meal tickets.  I wonder if these  are still good.  I don't like Miami  enough to fly down there  to get two free dinners,  and it would be  just my luck  to get there  and find out that  Joe's was out 
[03:28:30]  of stone crabs  that night.  I have crabs.  Oh, my God.  Here's something  I really like.  This is the American  double-donged dildo.  Right.  I like gaping.  Nothing really feels  better than  an asshole  full of plastic.  I hope the gift  he likes  is a plushie outfit  that he's going to  put on to everybody.  Put on a bunny outfit.  I'm going to now  wear my plushie outfit  and annoy everybody 
[03:29:00]  in the office.  They'll ask me questions  like,  why am I wearing that?  I'll say I get  hard-ons wearing it.  I fuck stuffed animals.  After the broadcast,  I'm going to a cuddle party,  and we're going to do,  what is it called,  a puppy pile?  Yes.  Get on the puppy pile.  Sometimes I go to  a cuddle party,  and I got a raging  hard-on.  Then we're going to watch  Ed Bradley jump up and down  and make a squishy sound.  Now there's a guy  that really needs a hug.  American flag 
[03:29:30]  drawn by the artist  Jasper Johns.  Hold on, hold on.  50% butter.  I need that!  What's the holdup  with the Sirius XM deal?  We can have breaking news.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  FCC, baby, that's it.  Could somebody get that  really fast in the back office?  What's going on?  Back office.  It was on CNBC.  It just aired.  Please, thank you.  What are your brothers  talking about? 
[03:30:00]  I want to talk about  cuddle parties  as Andy Rooney.  Have a cuddle party.  You know,  you get around and cuddle.  They say it's non-sexual.  Sometimes you need  a good hug.  And you need to  dry hump someone  until you have scabs  on your cock.  Ever get scabs  on your cock  from dry humping?  It really hurts.  I like to fill up  my pajamas with cum  at a cuddle party.  No one knows  that it's going on.  Always use  some kind of lubricant.  It gets chained 
[03:30:30]  if you don't.  And sometimes  your underwear  will stick to your dick  where the sore was  and you're bleeding through.  Stupid cuddle party.  It's Jasper Johns.  The American flag  shouldn't be used  as decoration,  but this is a work of art.  I don't know  what there is about it  that makes it  a real work of art,  but that's why  Jasper Johns  is an artist,  and I'm not.  The flag was sent  to me by Bruce Malinsky,  and he writes,  apologizing for not 
[03:31:00]  writing sooner.  He suggests we have  lunch together sometime.  Oh, that's okay, Bruce.  I haven't spent  a lot of time  waiting for your letter,  and by the way,  I charge $47.50  to have lunch  with anyone  I never heard of before.  So keep this stuff coming.  I wouldn't know  what to talk about  without it.  At least he's honest  as far as that goes.  This guy,  oh, we should do  lunch sometime.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yourself.  He's going to change  his name to Andy Looney.  Oh, he's crazy. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, a maniac.  Yeah.  Let's go to a cuddle party  with some of the viewers.  I don't know why  that makes me laugh,  but they haven't  had a cuddle party.  I was on a puppy pile once.  I didn't see any puppies.  I don't know why  it's called a puppy pile.  And some stranger  was cranking my penis.  It smelled like shit.  It was from all the assholes.  All the gaping assholes.  That could be it.  I was sticking my dick  in anything I could find.  Men, women, 
[03:32:00]  didn't really matter much  as long as I came.  That's the one thing  I'm going to...  Every day I bring  a little something home  from this radio show.  I'm going to be  Andy Rooney all day.  Andy Rooney.  Just talking about  cuddle party.  Cuddle party gone bad.  I've broken all the rules.  Too many rules  at a cuddle party.  I think they ought  to cut the rules out.  I think everyone  should go naked. 
[03:32:30]  What was it?  The welcome circle?  Yeah.  What's with the welcome circle?  I arrived late,  so I didn't know the rules.  Unless I'm getting  a hand job.  I don't want to be  in a circle with anybody.  Did you ever lick a pussy  at a cuddle party  and it smells like  someone else's bad breath?  Why does that happen?  Who have they been  cuddling with?  What part?  Sam, what do you got?  There's nothing going on.  What's CNBC?  There's a merger going on.  Sammy, what's the news?  Come on, kid.  They were just discussing 
[03:33:00]  some of the pros and cons  of the merger.  No, but it said,  why is it holding it up?  They were asking the question.  And they didn't know?  No, yeah.  They actually asked the question  and then they wrote it  on the screen  in case you didn't understand.  I completely know,  but no one asked me yet.  Oh, what's the deal?  They're allowing regular radio  to catch up  and then they're going to  allow the merger  to go through.  It's so fucking obvious.  The NAB has that much power.  They're letting the big companies  get their internet streaming  together and organized  and they're letting the HD, 
[03:33:30]  which is a joke,  maybe develop a little more.  That's all it is.  They're allowing the regular  broadcasters  to catch up technically  and then they're going to  allow the merger  to go through.  So obvious.  They basically said  to the main broadcasters  out there,  look,  we could give you  about a year,  a year and a half.  So get your shit together.  Absolutely.  The NAB is very powerful.  Extremely powerful. 
[03:34:00]  I'll be on Sean Hannity  tonight saying just that.  Oh yeah?  No.  Line of the day  is brought to you by  CarScan.  What the hell is this?  Remember?  Get all of your contacts.  Oh yeah,  I remember these guys.  Actually,  this is a really,  really good company.  You take all those  business cards that you get,  you put it in this machine  and it organizes  everything for you.  Yep.  I forgot how it organizes it though.  On your computer.  Computer,  and then you can download  it to your BlackBerry  and all that.  to your BlackBerry.  That's right.  All the phone numbers 
[03:34:30]  on the card itself  become links.  It's clickable links.  And this scan  is very,  very,  very smart.  It can organize  the whole thing  without you really  having to do much work.  It knows the address  on the card.  It knows what the address is,  what the name is,  what the phone number is.  I don't know how  they do this.  It's creepy.  Yeah,  you can cross-reference  the phone number  with the address.  You remember.  We had a great meeting  with these guys.  Yeah,  it was pretty cool.  It just zipped the cards  through and it knows  all this and organizes it  in such a way.  What is this?  A magical man? 
[03:35:00]  What is this?  Some type of witchcraft?  You put the card in,  it does all types of things.  Cardscan.com slash...  You don't have to do  backwards slash anymore  because everyone knows  what that slash is all about.  Slash.  Cardscan.com slash radio one.  Do not spill out one,  just put the number one.  You forgot the HTTP.  Semi-colon.  Colon.  Backslash.  Backslash.  Backslash.  Backslash.  W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W. 
[03:35:30]  Can I tell you  that my fucking...  What?!  My workout clothes  smell so bad.  Oh.  They fucking reek  so bad.  I smelled like...  You know when you're  fucking making Easter eggs?  That vinegar smell?  Oh, wow.  That's what I smelled like.  That's pretty bad.  And I said,  this is exactly like  an Easter egg.  It was putrid.  You're welcome.  Jimmy, did you just fart?  I did.  Why?  Because.  Why?  I don't know. 
[03:36:00]  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  You know, we have six flat screens in this area of the studio.  Every TV had a different disaster.  We had the tornadoes in Missouri.  We had the 7.8 earthquake in China over there.  We had the, what else?  Oh, the volcano.  Volcano and then the monsoon.  Except the halftime show.  Jimmy, that was very hurtful.  And it was the pregame show, so it wasn't even accurate.  Oh, I got scared. 
[03:36:30]  I confuse things in sports.  The man made a home run with his hands.  Jimmy, you want to do some non-sexual cuddling after the show today?  Yeah, if you could.  I might fill up a little bit.  But they said that's okay.  Okay.  Fan will raise my hand.  Yeah, Fan, you be the cock blocker.  Here is a, what are we doing?  Another runner-up.  Oh, yeah.  Runner-up line of the day.  Barkley, I've been trying for about 15 minutes here.  Doesn't work three times. 
[03:37:00]  He was...  You're making me crazy.  Hey!  Hey!  Fuckers.  You missed your joke three times.  It was funny.  It was funny.  It had a funny show.  And...  Oh, look at the Red Lobster commercial.  Oh, but it's for creditreport.com.  They're just eating lobsters.  Oh, and they're dressed in those...  Lobster bibs.  But they're dressed like, uh... 
[03:37:30]  Like in, um...  Pirates.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Hamilton.  All right, Hamilton.  Uh...  Uh...  You're going over there as a representative of Captain Hook.  Wear the uniform.  Have some pride.  I saw a weird movie over the weekend called Foot Fist Way or something like that.  Uh-huh.  It's the Will Ferrell movie.  Like some dude gave Will Ferrell a movie and Will Ferrell loved it so much he decided  to bank it and distribute the thing. 
[03:38:00]  It's getting quite a buzz.  I'm not sure if I liked it or hated it.  Really?  Huh?  A comedy or a drama?  A comedy.  It's just like Taekwondo instructor.  Um...  He's hilarious because he's so weird.  It's like kind of a Napoleon Dynamite type of movie.  Hmm.  I wish Roland was here today so he could talk about it a little bit because he loved it.  I wasn't sure if I liked it.  He's an intrigue.  Mm-hmm.  Ferrell was up.  He's...  Will Ferrell, he's going to stop by in June when he's promoting his...  No, he's not!  Of course he's not.  He's going to stop by when he's definitely ready to stop by when he's promoting his hair 
[03:38:30]  care products.  What?  Or some fucking guy in the future.  I love when he wants to get a guest on.  He goes, someone wants to stop by before we've even been pitched to them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if you guys think we're bad actors, go back in time and listen how we sold that semi-pro  fucking movie for him.  That was cool.  Holy shit.  We could tear down a wall today.  Oh my god.  All because he was supposed to come in.  Yep.  Here's another runner-up line of the day. 
[03:39:00]  And then the first thing he usually says is, I want to do that again.  Why is that funny?  Really?  Not.  That's usually the first thing he says after he shits his pants too.  He eats a donut.  Fucking kicks a small animal.  Rapes the neighbor.  What's going on over there, Jimmy?  Jimmy's wrecking the joint.  What happened?  You spilled water, you dropped the headphones on the ground, and you ripped your microphone 
[03:39:30]  out.  The microphone fell out.  The whole thing's going on over there.  I don't know.  The whole thing's going on.  I think you might have had too much mayo and it's getting to you.  No, it's all fat-free mayo.  It's no fat mayo at all.  I want to keep losing weight.  No fat-free mayo.  Wait, what was the line?  I missed the line.  Yeah, I don't know.  No, whatever.  I'm just...  I'm hopping on nothing.  What are you doing?  I'm trying to turn the headphone volume up so I can participate in the motherfucking  show.  Which one are we on?  I don't know.  Hell yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Where are we at?  Play that shit.  All right, another runner-up line of the day.  The guitars are tuned, the drums are smoking, and the...  And the cock is monstrous.  All right, come on, Ponyboy Curtis.  Next one.  All right, so you guys are members of the band named...  We're called Bill.  You're called Bill, and you are...  Stupid!  Stupid!  Oh, God. 
[03:40:30]  Hillary's going to win West Virginia, and then what?  Well, they said...  60 to 24.  60 to 24.  She's beating the shit out of him.  No shit, Jimmy.  Wow.  Bunch of white people.  Barack is losing the white vote, big time.  All right.  Yep.  He had it for a while, too.  How funny.  He's brought down by his own fucking preacher.  Ow.  It looks that way, huh?  Amazing.  We'll see, Jimmy.  That's selfish.  We got fucking...  Six months before the election.  We'll see what happens.  Yeah, but they won't be decided by June. 
[03:41:00]  No, I mean, he's going to get the nominee.  We don't know about that now.  Or the nomination.  He'll get the nomination.  Man, man.  Here's your line of the day.  Thank you, cardscan.com slash radio one.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  The guitars are tuned. 
[03:41:30]  The drums are smoking.  And the singers...  And the drum is down.  Pooh.  How dumb are you, Iraq?  How dumb are you?  We were going to go for the slick out today.  Line of the day.  Bam!  And Thad was basically giving him sign language to say just that.  And what were you thinking he was doing? 
[03:42:00]  I didn't...  It seemed odd.  He said, break right now.  I thought it was...  Oh, God.  Break.  Why would we take a break right now?  Break meaning we're done.  We're out of here.  You should have saw his face.  His brain was short-circuiting.  Travis, what do you got on that?  Anything?  I just don't want to laugh over Eric.  You don't want to laugh in there?  It's completely obvious.  Break means break.  Yeah, he did the universal sign of break, meaning get him out of here.  What did you think it meant, Eric?  I didn't know.  I thought you were breaking bread for me. 
[03:42:30]  His hair.  That's why I called him Ponyboy Curtis.  What's wrong with his hair?  It's terrible.  Nice.  It's fucking...  You know what it is?  He has a fucking toilet seat cover hair.  I kind of like his...  Oh, how am I going to put this?  Well, he looks like the older brother in Weird Science, so...  He's got the...  Wasn't that Bill Paxton or something?  Chet?  Yeah.  Chet?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he does.  He looks like Slider from Top Gun. 
[03:43:00]  Fucking Shaggug do.  I should make...  Slider from Top Gun.  If Slider...  Definitely.  If he ate the real Slider.  Just reworking a line.  That's right.  That's what I'd do.  All right, guys.  Thank you so much.  It was...  It's been a long time running out of steam.  I'll tell you that much.  We did pretty good today.  Dude, we did great today.  You know what?  I say that we take tomorrow off.  We did so great.  All right.  We're not taking tomorrow off. 
[03:43:30]  Don't worry.  Stop.  Got to read that all night long.  Somebody, though, is leaving the Opian Anthony show.  Yep.  At the end of the month.  That is a fact.  Can't just give the answer away now.  What fun is that?  What fun is that?  None fun.  Can I plug my MySpace?  I haven't got any MySpace friends in a while.  I'm going to need that for a while.  Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy.  MySpace.  In a fancy world.  Sorry for all the background noise.  I just been opening a box.  I got another gift. 
[03:44:00]  Where status is everything.  Thanks, Andy from Seattle.  He sent me a used drill.  One man.  I'm an entertainer.  A fancy man.  Do you understand?  There's a fancy entertainer talking.  We'll begin a quest for the ultimate gift.  Fuck you.  The Drill Diva.  Anybody have anything lighter?  Like maybe a fucking bowling ball with two ledge shoes?  When a regular gift is out of reach.  How about just some pictures of vaginas and some pornography?  Right.  And the gift he gets is unacceptable.  For your deeds, you should have a cordless drill in your house. 
[03:44:30]  Well, Simone, what do you want?  I want a new drill.  Dude, you don't appreciate shit, huh?  I want a cordless fancy drill, boy.  The Drill Diva took my breath away, says Eric Nagel.  Think about how I feel, hoping I have a new cordless gift and seeing that cumbersome cord.  And Ben from Boston raves, wah-ha-ha-ha, dude-dude.  You want me, me, plugging a cord in like you have to?  You've never seen a spoiled brat hissy fit like this. 
[03:45:00]  You don't deserve to sit there.  Shut your dumb Italian mouth.  I'm talking, boy.  The Drill Diva, coming soon.  Jimmy, you're a cock.  Fuck you and fuck your mother.  What do you think of them apples? </pre>
