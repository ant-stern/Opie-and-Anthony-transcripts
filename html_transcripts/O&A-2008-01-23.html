<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts lamenting their lack of a boss, resulting in scheduling chaos exemplified by an overabundance of live reads and a disastrous attempt at a live performance by Finger Eleven, plagued by technical difficulties.  This was followed by Anthony's visceral, graphic, and derogatory description of the visually disturbing advertisements for a cleft palate program displayed on buses.  The death of Heath Ledger became a recurring theme, with repeated, satirical emphasis on the fact that he was found nude, and mockery of the media's coverage.  The hosts also briefly and sarcastically discussed the Academy Award nominations.  Finger Eleven, present for the attempted performance, were the only in-studio guests during this initial portion.

The broadcast continued with further discussion of Heath Ledger's death, this time joined by in-studio guest Sam. They extensively mocked the media's focus on Ledger's nudity, highlighting absurd statements from news reporters.  This segment also included a discussion of Tom Brady's presence in New York City before the Super Bowl and the Boston fans' reaction, Amy Winehouse's relapse and rehab, and Ringo Starr's walk-off from *Regis and Kelly*.  The segment was filled with off-color jokes, vulgar language, listener-submitted "FU" messages, and a man-on-the-street report from outside Ledger's apartment building. The hosts concluded this section by promoting their website and MySpace pages.

Next, the show returned to Heath Ledger's death, followed by a discussion of motion sickness experienced by viewers of *Cloverfield*.  This unexpectedly transitioned into a Jamaican song about apparent child sexual abuse, prompting jokes and Beatles parodies from the hosts and callers. The conversation then circled back to Heath Ledger's death, exploring the possibility of accidental or intentional overdose and the role of prescription drugs.  A phone call from Dr. Jody Gold, a psychiatrist, offered advice on discussing death and prescription drug safety with children, followed by listener calls sharing personal experiences.

The final segment featured a continued discussion of Heath Ledger's death and the disproportionate media coverage of celebrity deaths compared to other tragedies.  This part included persistent interruptions from a prank caller, "Ramon," delivering bizarre and offensive statements.  The hosts interjected with their typical vulgar and inappropriate humor, including jokes about Ledger's death and other unrelated topics,  audio clips of a woman arguing in a coffee shop, news stories about eye injuries (including one involving a man biting his girlfriend's eye out), and a discussion of their own flatulence which led to a farting competition.  Further interruptions included an audio clip from a phone sex hotline, promotion of a fictional book-on-tape narrated by a homeless man, and a fundraising segment for cleft palate children.  Throughout this segment, the hosts used highly sexual, misogynistic, and homophobic language.

The broadcast ended with a short segment solely consisting of laughter and the names "Danny" and "E-Rock," suggesting a humorous moment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their officers.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Wow.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Usually I'm all right.  That one is...  I've been dropping them all morning.  I can't help it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  My eyes are tearing.  I had a dream that I had a threesome.  This is the absolute truth with Tom Chiasano.  It looks like a lemon party with one chick. 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  Shut up, you f***ing moron.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  Die.  Die.  Die.  All right.  Wow.  If we pull this off, we're going to be what?  Employed.  Employed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's right. 
[00:01:30]  That's the real deal.  Ding-a-ling-a-ling-a.  Ah, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Day two without a boss here in New York City.  Nice.  And today's problem?  They got live reads like every two minutes.  Oh, my God.  I know we're on XM, but see, the beauty of hearing us on regular radio is we get to do  live commercial reads.  And today's problem, they scheduled way too many live commercial reads. 
[00:02:00]  Oops.  Well, this place is running without a boss and things are falling apart.  I kind of like it because, you know, we got to bring in the revenue.  Because that's what it's all about.  For who, though?  I don't know.  We don't have a boss.  The janitor?  I mean, who's looking at the bottom line?  Whoever's going to look at the bottom line and go, job well done, gentlemen.  We report to nobody once again.  How many times in our career have we not had a boss? 
[00:02:30]  Every time right before we get fired.  Oh, no.  That's going to happen soon.  It's obvious to everybody out there.  Big meeting going down next week, right?  Um, I'm not saying anything about anything.  Why?  Because that's how I roll.  I keep all the stuff on what they call the QT.  You're going to say big meeting, though.  The DL.  I wasn't giving details.  Mmm. 
[00:03:00]  We could say it could get interesting.  Well.  All right, I'm going to shut up.  Opie and Anthony on your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A.  Anthony started ranting, and we pretty much shut him up because we want it on the air.  It's infuriating.  What is going on with the buses?  And I'm not even talking about just the New York City buses.  I'm talking about the buses out by on Long Island.  In the entire area, you can't get away from it. 
[00:03:30]  Downtown Buffalo.  I was there the other day, and it's unbelievable some of the things that are on the sides of the buses.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I fly into these cities for a day trip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just check it out.  And what you were saying just before we went on the air, I noticed that in downtown Buffalo.  This is what's got me.  Years ago, we wanted our WOW logo put on the back of city buses to promote the program.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Which is today, by the way.  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  Happy Whip them out Wednesday.  Put a WOW on your vehicle, and a girl will see it and flash you. 
[00:04:00]  Will she?  No.  Yes.  Yes.  But it was deemed.  I've decided I'm going to be a sarcastic douche today.  Oh, cool.  Sarcastic douche.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Say it.  Why is today any different?  I was going to say it.  Oh.  I was going to say, I could never see you behaving that way.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Jimmy is countering with sarcastic douche number two.  Let's all just be sarcastic douches. 
[00:04:30]  No.  Why don't we not?  By the way, we got breaking news after Anthony's bus story.  Yes.  It's going to be a great story.  It's breaking news.  It's just breaking.  There's a Hollywood actor who died, and we're going to tell you who it is in a few minutes.  So stay right there, please.  It's mysterious.  Yes.  But back to the buses.  Yeah, so we wanted our WOW logo, and nothing more than W-O-W in the font, the nice yellow 
[00:05:00]  font, and Opie and Anthony and the time we're on and whatever at the station, to be on the  backs of the buses here in New York.  They said no.  The New York City, like the bus company or the advertising firm, whatever it is, said no  because they found out what it meant and said it's too offensive.  Now, if you know what it means, you're familiar with the program, and just seeing a WOW on  the back of a bus isn't going to offend anybody.  If you don't know what it means, it just says, WOW, hey, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  And that doesn't offend anyone.  And just looking at it doesn't offend anybody.  Right.  Let me tell you what I'm offended at and disgusted at that is on the back of what seems to be  every single bus in the area that I move around in, even, like I said, my hometown  out there on Long Island.  It's these little monsters, these little monstrous children with half of their upper lip and 
[00:06:00]  bottom of their nose missing, showing snaggled teeth that are gapped in the middle and sticking  out where you see the jawbone and half their nose is ripped open.  Yeah.  It's like if you took a bag of potato chips and you know how you rip open the bag?  Yep.  That's what they did to some of these kids' faces.  Dude.  Predator face.  Predator face.  Sure.  Predator face.  Little predator faced monsters because they have this campaign going on where you toss a 
[00:06:30]  few bucks and they could sew the kids' upper lip shut.  It's the cleft palate program for little kids.  Third world nation crap.  Right, right.  Doesn't happen in America.  Third world nation.  They show all these little kids that usually you see with the flies buzzing around or they  don't have food or they're bathing in sewage or whatever it is on the late night commercials  for the Christian's Children Fund or whatever it is.  But this one is to send your money so they could sew that gaping hatchet wound shut on these 
[00:07:00]  kids' upper jaws on their upper lip.  But let me tell you something.  This could be done in a less shocking and, in my opinion, disgusting way.  I was pulling out of a Starbucks yesterday.  What?  Well, I was getting coffee for my girlfriend.  You're not a Starbucks guy.  I know.  But I was getting...  That's why I said what?  You already explained yourself.  Oh, sarcastic douche.  Yes.  Okay.  What were you doing? 
[00:07:30]  Starbucks for your...  Cool.  I like it.  But there was a lovely piece of banana cake.  Now, I sometimes like a little treat.  So I decided to get me a little piece of that banana cake.  We're not talking about alcohol, right?  Obviously.  No, no.  Okay.  Banana cake.  Little treat.  So I got it.  It's an awesome treat.  I was calling him out on the little treat thing.  He was talking about alcohol.  My character's not me.  I know. 
[00:08:00]  I understand.  And I couldn't wait to get home.  So I open the bag.  And as I'm driving out of the parking lot, I take a bite of this banana cake.  And it is heavenly.  Heavenly.  And then I get behind a bus.  Was it?  And there's the old creature from Guatemala with his upper lip opened up and snaggled teeth 
[00:08:30]  and half his nose missing so you could see inside his sinuses.  And all I could imagine was him taking a bite of my banana cake.  And you know where that banana cake went?  Out the window.  Why?  Because it disgusted me.  I couldn't get past the thought of his slimy, can't hold the saliva in that open wound mouth  that was on the back of this bus.  Can we get the damn kids with the hatchet wounds in their mouth off the buses?  It's offensive. 
[00:09:00]  It's physically nauseating to me.  But it gets the job done.  Does it?  Yeah, because you just throw money at the situation.  Just make it go away.  Make it leave.  Just take my money.  Make it stop.  Look at that.  They're adorable.  They're monsters.  They're little monsters.  If you saw a kid peeking around a corner, you've seen this before.  You've been in a supermarket.  A little kid peeks around the corner.  And you look.  And you give a little wave.  And it's like he gives a little shy wave and runs away. 
[00:09:30]  And then you take him into the bathroom and put him in a big shopping bag.  Oh, sorry.  That wasn't me.  It was my character.  If one of these little monsters poked their head around a corner and smiled at you and  you just saw it, you'd go, ah, ah, it would freak you out.  And then you would give the kid money and say, just get that fixed.  Yeah, you'd put a quarter in the slot that is supposed to be closed under his nose. 
[00:10:00]  A little piggy bank child.  That's very unattractive.  It is.  I don't want to look at it.  Would you kiss his little cheek?  Why wouldn't you kiss that?  I would be nowhere near that.  You know that saliva is just pouring out of that trough.  I don't want to look at it.  You can just safety pin it together.  I don't mind him after surgery.  I know you have a problem with that Joaquin Phoenix, but he was born like that.  Was he?  They sewed it shut.  Cheech Marin.  Cheech, our own lovable Cheech. 
[00:10:30]  He had that too.  Really?  Yeah, they sewed it up and everything's fine.  I don't care.  Put him on the buses after they're sewed up.  And say, look, look at what we did.  We helped a little monster.  But I don't want to see him like that.  And what is that?  What happened in the womb?  I don't know.  He got into a fight.  He was disrespectful.  Someone with a pinky ring gave him a belt right in his lip and nose repeatedly.  I am just like disgusted by it and the thought that they didn't put W.O.W. on the back of 
[00:11:00]  the bus.  But we have to stare at these and they're on, like I said, every goddamn bus.  Thank you.  Very upsetting to me.  Very upsetting.  Is it a comedy ad?  Yeah, it's a comedy ad.  They're making jokes about it.  Well, all right.  You go, look, he could hock a loogie through that.  I still think you could have ate your banana cake.  No, because all I thought about was him biting it.  Cakey, not flaky, right?  Oh, it was so cakey and moist. 
[00:11:30]  It was so moist and cakey.  Yeah.  And I was enjoying it so.  And I had a look.  Oh, it bothered.  No, I can't look at it.  Yet I'm compelled to because I'm like pulled up right behind the bus.  I couldn't eat something with milk in it.  Like if I was eating cereal with milk, then I could be disgusted by a sight.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If I was eating something cakey, it probably wouldn't bother me.  Because I pictured him biting it.  Oh, yeah.  And then leaving like this little keystone in the middle of it where his teeth aren't and 
[00:12:00]  his lip isn't.  Like he'd bite it and it would have this ridge.  Yeah.  And it would be all slobbery.  Yeah, yeah.  And like, yeah, there's nothing to keep the snot away from the spit.  Look at that guy.  Well, that was, he was born a while ago.  Yeah, he didn't fix that one.  They can't fix that one.  That's surgery.  All right.  So why didn't you just say no if the boy asked for some cake?  See, I'd rather you didn't.  I couldn't get it out of my head.  He had already bitten my banana cake and it had to go out the window. 
[00:12:30]  See, if I'm eating cereal and I saw footage of someone like blowing a snot rocket, that  would creep me out.  Like there's something about the milk that I can't eat milk when I think of gross things  or whatever.  Let's go to Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, uh, Anthony, you're a fancy man.  Why do they have buses for the poor in your town?  Uh, no, well, it's driving to my town on the way.  All right.  And we'll go to Max in Dallas. 
[00:13:00]  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  I guess you could call them all, old jet intake face.  Jet intake face.  They, they, they got some bad ones down here or they had some bad ones down here in Dallas  for a while.  They're doing some sort of a campaign about intestines or something.  And I swear to God, it showed a doctor like pulling intestines out of a person.  I wanted to ralp every time I got behind one of those damn butts.  You know, I don't understand that. 
[00:13:30]  On TV, we got a look at no leg guy because he smoked and I got blood clots and chopped  his leg off.  Blood clots, heart attacks, strokes all by the, all, all before he turned 30, I think.  Yeah.  And then we had swab out his blowhole guy that was on TV.  You know, it's, it's shock marketing, shock marketing.  They're trying to get you to do something and they're shocking you by doing it.  Yeah.  I love how they'll do a story on us. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  It'd be shock jocks, being shocking or outrageous because you say some words that are, Oh, that  everyone uses on a daily basis.  And then they show cancer guys smoking cigarettes through his neck, through his neck.  And they show somebody wringing out tar out of a lung and then the old jet intake face.  And that usually is right after a story about us.  Great.  Yeah.  Hey, what's more offensive?  Moving on to Jimmy.  Jimmy saw old country for no country for no men. 
[00:14:30]  No country for old men.  Old country for no men.  A bunch of lesbians running around.  It's called the Fulton Street Fish Market.  Smooth delivery, huh, Jim?  Yes.  What'd you think of the movie, Jim?  I saw it recently as well.  I liked it a lot.  I thought it was a little overrated, but I did like it.  Really?  Yeah.  Why do you think it was overrated?  A couple of things with the storyline itself.  I was really well acted, but there's a couple of scenes they shot that I probably wouldn't  have put in.  There's one scene that Tommy Lee Jones has with I think his brother or someone in his family, 
[00:15:00]  which I thought was unnecessary and kind of took away from the story.  But it was still a really well acted movie.  Yeah.  What'd you think of the killer?  I think he was great.  He was a problem, huh?  With this Prince Valiant hairdo.  Yeah, he was wonderful.  Bill Burr sent me an email and said, dude, this is probably one of the worst movie bad guys  you're ever going to see.  He's just horrid.  Oh, yeah.  He's not a good man.  Yeah.  He's not a good man.  He's not easy to negotiate with.  He is so freaking believable. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  That scene with the old man at the counter at the mini mart or whatever you want to call  it?  Absolutely.  Flipper coin.  Wow.  Wow.  One of the best scenes in recent memory.  Flipper coin.  Flipper coin.  And I got to say it.  He's a creep.  Yeah, I got to say it.  And did Woody Harrelson take you out of the movie there, Jimmy?  No.  Woody Harrelson had, let's say, a cameo.  He has a very small role, but I like the way his role kind of changed.  If anyone's seen the movie, you know what I mean.  The attitude of his character changed, and I liked it, actually.  I like Woody Harrelson. 
[00:16:00]  I can take him in doses like this.  I don't know if I want to see him for 40 minutes of the movie.  Yeah.  I have a, because SAG sends out screener copies for SAG members just to kind of dive into the  wild, too, which I want to see.  Oh.  Into the wild was really.  I'm going to vote on who I think should win the Academy Oscar award.  Academy Oscar awards.  Are they even going to have the Oscars this year?  Oh, I don't know.  Why don't they have these award shows and let these dopes get up there and just babble?  Oh, would that be great?  That would be, you would get some nice ratings.  Highest ratings in years, I bet.  Yeah, I know those shows do well, but why not have these guys, they're supposed to be 
[00:16:30]  so brilliant, go up there and just babble after they win an award.  Here it is.  You won an award.  Now, sincerely, from your own heart, get up there and talk about how you feel about the  award.  Right.  Instead of something that maybe one of your friends wrote for you.  And if you're presenting an award, get up there and talk about the nominees and how  you feel about the movie.  Just, whatever.  Just babble.  Wing it.  We do it every morning. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Seems to work for us.  Hope so.  None of this crap is written down ever.  Did you see what it looked like, Ant?  Huh?  I'm showing Ant the picture of the guy.  Of what?  From No Country for Old Men?  Yeah, because obviously that movie was nominated.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good hairdo.  Yeah.  Do.  He looks like Prince Valiant.  You know what I did the beautiful part of him?  Is he's a horrible, he's basically an emotionless psychopath, and yet he has the sweetest boy hairdo. 
[00:17:30]  Anyone that's seen No Country for Old Men, the bad, bad guy in that has the most tussleable  good boy hairdo.  He's the sweetest.  He has a sweet boy hairdo.  You'd see his hair and go, who's the sweet boy approaching me, pointing that weapon?  This must be an accident.  No one makes me laugh about that stuff.  You know the guy had to walk around like that for six to eight months looking like a  old tool.  And no one knew he had his hair like that for a movie role. 
[00:18:00]  Is he a big Spanish actor?  He must be.  He was way too good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like the second billion behind Tommy Lee Jones.  I think he's pretty popular.  Yeah.  Or something.  He must be.  Should we do the Oscar nominations, people?  Ooh, I like doing the Oscar nominations.  Maybe we should let other shows do that, because it's all the movies you know.  It's all the actors you know.  There's no surprises there.  There was some big surprises for me.  Oh, really?  Like what, Jimmy?  I don't have the list in front of me, but I remember going, holy Toledo. 
[00:18:30]  Holy Toledo, huh?  Like No Country for Old Men, of course it's nominated for the...  Oh, here we go.  Oh, good.  Best picture.  Travis is getting it for us.  Let's show the people how boring this actually is.  But every radio show, every TV show will do this for you.  Watch this.  Watch this.  Oh, here's mine.  Yeah.  I'm real interested.  Best picture.  Atonement.  Sarcastic douche.  Thank you.  Oh.  Juno.  Michael Clayton. 
[00:19:00]  Did you say Juno?  Blee-blee.  Linger-linger.  No Country for Old Men, and There Will Be Blood.  Mm-hmm.  I wonder how many people out there went, wow.  Wow.  That's a surprise.  Best director.  Best actress.  You just named...  That's it.  Just name the categories.  Oh, there's been some snubbing.  Best supporting actress.  Best supporting actress.  Wow.  Best actor. 
[00:19:30]  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  Best supporting actor.  Wow.  Mm-hmm.  There's a surprise in that category.  Best animated feature.  Best documentary feature.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, he's nominated, though.  You know what?  Yeah.  Javier Bardem is the bad guy from No Country for Old Men.  He's actually nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  He's going to win that.  I don't know if he should, though.  He was kind of...  He was great, but he was pretty much just a, you know, a psycho.  Yeah.  What if he's a real fun, happy guy in real life? 
[00:20:00]  Then he'd be really acting to do that.  If he's a silent type psychopath...  I think any actor is acting to do what he did.  No one is really like that.  He's going to just be all smiles.  Yeah.  Oh, I was hoping that guy was kind of real.  How about we get to the important category?  Best Adapted Screenplay.  Ooh.  Yeah.  The nominees are Atonement, Away From Her, The Diving Bell, and The Butterfly, No Country 
[00:20:30]  for Old Men, and There Will Be Blood.  No surprises there, huh?  One of those has gone away.  Best Music, Original Song.  Original Score.  Atonement, The Kite Runner, which I hear is really hilarious.  There you go.  There's our boy who gets his comeuppance.  There's our Oscar nomination.  Comeuppance.  Our Oscar nominations break.  Yeah.  Pretty good, right?  Yep.  Vote for yourself.  See how well you do on Oscar night. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  The phones are lit, but if you want to get a hold of us a little later on, phone number  is 877-212-ONA.  You got onaradio.com with Steve and S. from Bayshore's show rundowns every day.  When he feels like riding them, by the way, sometimes you finally get to read about the  show, I don't know, at 11 o'clock at night.  He's a busy man.  A mere 16, 18 hours after we actually did the radio show.  He's grown a beard.  Yeah, I know.  He's a creep.  He was at FH Riley's just creeping around again.  I'm like, will you just come over and say hi? 
[00:21:30]  Is he skulking?  Oh, he's just the worst.  He's like, I don't want to be a bother, and he's just kind of on the outskirts, and he  kind of comes in for a handshake and then runs away.  Steve.  And then gets...  Relax.  You're part of the show now.  Then gets another beer.  He hangs out.  He reminds me of the scent that wafts over a septic tank, where he's just kind of there,  and you're like, will you just come over, and you're just kind of about five feet above  the ground, hanging there.  Come here.  He says the website was down last night. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, was it?  So Joe never posted it.  Oh.  Well, we don't have a boss around here.  Yeah.  It's pretty obvious to everyone that Tom Chiusano actually was very important to this  joint.  Apparently so.  Because a lot of things have messed up since he's...  Not so much messed up, just gone away.  Since his retirement.  We couldn't get the band to play live yesterday.  We finally got him to play.  Yeah.  To all the people that gave up on us and went to another radio station, Finger Eleven did  perform two songs, and they were terrific.  Yes.  Anthony's computer has crashed. 
[00:22:30]  We got way too many live reads today.  And what was the other thing?  Oh, and the onaradio.com has crashed yesterday, so they couldn't do the show right now.  Just a few of the things going wrong with no boss in-house.  All right.  Breaking news.  After the break, we're going to tell you which Hollywood actor was found dead here in  New York City.  It's breaking news, and we'll tell you who that person is after the break.  Yes.  Okay?  Tragic.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, why would that work?  There we go.  They just wanted to catch my laughter.  Was it something good for the radio show?  Oh, hell no.  Opie and Anthony.  Jim Norton.  Doing a radio show for you, the faithful listeners.  You.  For you.  You.  What is this? 
[00:23:30]  There we go.  Okay, now it kicks in.  It needed to kick in.  All right.  Opie, could you please say absolutely, Eslo today, a guy in Wagbag started a thread about  you saying it and how he hates it, so I want him to suffer.  Thanks.  Oh, absolutely I can do that.  Absolutely.  You say that a lot.  I never noticed that.  Oh, they pick up on my crutches.  Whatever.  I never noticed that.  Go after yourself.  No, I just didn't notice it. 
[00:24:00]  Jimmy.  Easily hurt guy.  Easily hurt guy?  That's a person who grew up with alcoholics and can't get over it.  I'm always wondering, no, what?  No, are you okay?  Are you okay?  No, I didn't mean to.  You know, people purposely put themselves in a line of fire as you're yelling at someone  else, and then you yell at them, and they're like, what are you yelling at me for?  What?  Like you yelled at.  What?  Ah, the old gurney.  Damn.  I can't believe he's dead. 
[00:24:30]  Absolutely.  It's just bugging me now.  Opie needs to stop.  Suggestions for another word.  Go F yourself.  Do it.  What?  Kicking apart this dumb radio show.  Just listen.  That's your job, to just listen.  Right.  Phone number 877-2120-NA.  Yesterday was a cluster F of epic proportions.  We spent probably an hour trying to get Finger Eleven to perform live on our show.  They had set up the night before, I believe. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Making sure everything would run smooth as silk.  You know how bad we F'd those guys?  Oh.  They were supposed to perform Monday.  Mm-hmm.  It was set up, I don't know, weeks in advance.  And we said, you know what?  The great Martin Luther King died for our sins.  So we got to take Monday off and reflect.  Sins.  You're confusing him with Jesus.  Sins.  Oh.  But we had to reflect.  Okay.  And we had to like take the day off and, you know, and do some of that praying and stuff. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  You know, kneeling down toward the sun and stuff.  I just reflected.  You just reflected?  Reflection.  A little reflection.  Reflection.  That's all.  Yeah?  Yeah.  So they had to hang out in a hotel for an extra day.  Uh-huh.  They set up 24 hours in advance.  They come in here for the big performance.  And because this place has no boss, all hell broke loose.  And it took 40 to 45 minutes to figure out what the F was wrong. 
[00:26:00]  All live on the show, by the way.  Get the lead singer's mic to work.  Yeah.  Scott, who's a very cool guy who will never talk to us again.  Lead singer's mic.  Not too important.  No.  Not probably the most important thing to have work.  No.  So they finally performed and they were great.  They really sounded great.  Maybe we'll play Paralyzer sometime this morning.  Yeah, it was good.  Just in case you were one of the many that, you know, turned off the show yesterday because 
[00:26:30]  we didn't have our S together.  But Derek put this together.  This is actual audio and just a little taste because this went on for 45 minutes.  Just a little taste, less than a minute, of us just trying to figure out what the hell  was going on live on the radio.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We don't know what the f*** we're doing.  All right.  We got finger 11 in the studio.  Is that mic?  Did you try the mic?  Are we set up or?  It's supposed to be working.  Can you hear me at all? 
[00:27:00]  A little bit.  Can you hear me only a little bit?  Yeah.  You're picking up on the other mics, I think.  That doesn't sound good at all.  Is there a way he can get him a different mic?  That doesn't sound right.  Anything work?  Does anything work?  Play a guitar or something.  Does that one work?  Just hit the.  That's sort of hearing that a little bit.  That's coming.  That one.  Shut your mics off for one second and see if you hear these mics at all.  All right.  Just a radio show.  Ready?  Go.  One, two, three, four.  I knew this would happen.  We didn't expect this to work.  Oh, my God. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  And this is not embarrassing at all to have like a really big band in looking at us like  we're just douches.  But it was working.  What the hell?  That's what you want to hear, by the way.  And that was just a piece.  What the hell?  A small piece.  That could have gone on probably for ten minutes of us just going, what?  What happened?  Does it work?  I don't think it works.  Will it work?  There's a funny part where Than put the headphones on and Tim is like, thought he had it. 
[00:28:00]  He goes, is it working?  And Than went, no.  And Tim went, why?  Yeah.  He was a little boy.  Like, he just couldn't pretend anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, it happens.  That this was okay.  So, breaking news.  Oh, my goodness.  Everybody's going to be talking about this today.  He's dead?  Yeah.  Heath Ledger is dead.  No.  Found, if you didn't know by now, found in the nude face down.  He was found in a apartment.  Here in New York City.  Yeah, he was found nude, by the way. 
[00:28:30]  Nude.  Naked.  Naked.  Yeah.  At the foot of his bed.  Nude.  He was nude with some sleeping pills around his nude body.  Nude, naked body.  Nude, naked, nude body.  He was unclothed at the time they found him, I believe.  Sands Clothes.  Yes, Sands Clothing.  Right.  A masseuse and a housekeeper came in because they had an appointment.  And discovered. 
[00:29:00]  His nude body.  His very nude, naked body.  His completely devoid of clothing, nude body was found at the foot of his bed, which he  probably slept in, in the nude.  Hence why he was nude and naked when they found him dead.  Completely unclothed.  Right.  And nude.  You see, the news had to say nude and naked a lot.  And we're kind of being sarcastic douches today.  Is it so necessary that when celebrities die, we have to know if they had their goddamn clothes 
[00:29:30]  on or not?  Is that so important?  This would have been an interesting point if he was found in a Walmart.  Exactly.  Thank you.  If you're found in your bedroom, nude, not really a reportable.  No.  It's trying to be titillating with a dead guy.  That's like saying, it's almost like if you were found in the shower with a top coat and 
[00:30:00]  hat.  Right.  Odd.  That's interesting.  Odd.  If they found him wearing a tutu.  Yes.  That would be something to report.  A tutu.  Wow.  He was found dead wearing a tutu.  That's a little odd.  But to say that he was found nude and naked and with no clothing on.  Perhaps he sleeps with nothing on.  My God.  And just in case you thought we were making this up, about the nude thing.  Yeah.  The Australian-born actor's housekeeper found him dead lying face down naked at the foot 
[00:30:30]  of his bed.  Found naked face down.  Ledger was lying face down naked.  Face down and naked at the foot of a bed.  Ledger was naked and lying face down at the foot of his bed.  What?  Like, what?  I will never understand why that is news.  I don't know.  Because the Marilyn Monroe thing, that was a big thing, that she was found nude.  Yeah.  Any actor, John Belushi, I believe, was also found nude. 
[00:31:00]  But they didn't want to say he was found nude, because no one wants that image in their  head.  Yeah, the body bag being wheeled out looked a little different with him and Heath Ledger.  You could almost see Heath's abs through that body bag.  But John Belushi, no.  Like there was a hippity hop in there.  So what do you think happened?  He was nude, Opie.  He was naked.  I'm going to go with blunt force to the head as the cause of death.  Colonel Mustard in the bedroom with a candlestick. 
[00:31:30]  I think he hung himself.  Well.  Ah.  And then fell.  On the rope.  Naked on the bed.  Rope fell off and rolled under somewhere.  It's funny you should say that, Jimmy.  Because, you know.  And the papers will do articles.  This is another theme of the show today.  The newspapers will do articles on us and on how outrageous we are and we're just disgusting  and we should be off the air.  Trying to titillate.  Right.  Trying to shock the audience.  And by the way, I've saved every newspaper article ever written about us and I'm going 
[00:32:00]  to write a book about it someday.  About how horrific they were in reporting the Opie and Anthony show in their papers.  I think we're very qualified to do a whole book just based on the news.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So the same paper that will call us disgusting and say things like our parents should be tarred  and feathered and thrown in the, what, the Hudson River for the Sex for Sam prank.  Just horrific things about us and our family and stuff.  What do you do in a row?  Right.  They have no problem.  They have no problem showing a picture of Heath Ledger hanging from a noose on page four 
[00:32:30]  today.  Obviously, it's a photograph from a movie role he was doing.  But why do they need to show this picture today in the paper?  Because they want it to look like that's the hanging picture so you can read it, of course.  Yeah, like, wow.  Oh, my God.  They put a picture of him in there hanging and dead.  But no, that was from a movie.  And there's absolutely no reason to put that in there. 
[00:33:00]  And we're shocking and we're outrageous.  That's pretty outrageous right there.  I don't care.  I mean, do this if you want.  But don't then turn around and act like you're above everything.  Well, I'm upset because they're teasing us because in that picture, he's not nude.  Naked nude.  Naked nude.  Naked nude.  Nude.  Naked.  Nude.  Naked.  Nude.  Naked.  Nude.  Nude.  It's going to be, what, sleeping pills, a little Xanax.  I'm going to go with a little mixture and mess them up a bit.  It was Valium, I think. 
[00:33:30]  Valium, Xanax, Ambien.  Which they say you've got to be careful with that Ambien.  I know a lot of listeners are into the Ambien thing.  You've got to be really careful with that crap.  They've done reports on it, so it's a bit dangerous.  Yeah, a little bit if you OD.  A bit dangerous, especially if you're mixing it with other things unintentionally.  And they said he had pneumonia, which, you know, if you're just laying there with pneumonia,  you pretty much drown nude in your own nudeness.  Did you say nude? 
[00:34:00]  I think I did.  If I didn't, he was nude.  The Australian-born actor's housekeeper found him dead, lying face down naked at the foot  of his bed.  Found naked face down.  Ledger was lying face down naked.  Face down and naked at the foot of a bed.  Ledger was naked and lying face down at the foot of his bed.  Naked.  Totally naked.  Naked.  Face down.  The quotes were really good.  Naked nude.  Naked nude.  He was so naked, he was naked nude. 
[00:34:30]  By the way, can we make it official?  This is what we do on our show.  I guess God needed a gay cowboy.  I guess God needed someone who could spit in his hand and grab another gentleman.  Best known for his role as a gay cowboy.  How many times did you hear that?  Yes.  Best known.  It is real tragic, by the way.  It does suck, of course.  Absolutely awful.  I would love to hear our own pal Scorch report this story.  He was found totally nude, naked. 
[00:35:00]  He entered the kingdom of nakedness.  Linger longer.  Yes.  Naked militia.  He's part of the naked militia.  It says here, acting royalty mourns the loss of a young master.  And they have a couple of really, really meaningful quotes.  Yeah.  Like, superstar actress Nicole Kidman called her fellow Australian's death a tragedy.  Really?  My heart goes out to his family.  Hmm.  Which I like the fact that at least she should give a statement that means something.  And then, uh...  Hey, Heath, put your goddamn clothes back on. 
[00:35:30]  Bip-bip-dee-doo.  Mel Gibson said, uh, I had such great hope for him.  He was just taking off, and to lose his life at such a young age is a tragic loss.  What did the lead singer of Men at Work say?  Um...  Thank you, Sam.  That he's, uh...  That he's, uh, down under?  He gets it.  Yes.  These are all, like, down under people.  Yeah, they have to pick...  They have to get down under people.  It's the local angle for them.  So I went with a Men at Work joke. 
[00:36:00]  Well, uh, John Travolta had an interesting quote.  He said, he's one of my favorite actors.  His abilities are rare.  It's a tremendous loss.  Why do they get quotes from people, ever?  Tom Cruise?  Any word from Tom Cruise in Scientology?  I don't know.  No.  Did he say he was being glib, being dead?  I think he said he deserved to, because he was taking pills.  And all people that take pills should die.  Yeah.  Should die nude.  I don't understand why they have quotes from actors.  Quotes are never...  No one ever says anything you're not going to expect.  And they're dumb statements from somebody else anyway. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, read this.  Yeah.  Or they put out the statement for you.  Look, this is what we wrote for you.  Is it okay if we give it to the press?  Yeah, this is the statement that you're going to be...  It's going to be attributed to you.  We wrote it.  Right.  But we'll run it by you.  We might know a little something about that.  Because you're much too stupid and irresponsible to speak for yourself.  And every word's got to mean something.  It's got to be perfectly written.  Yes.  Something you are obviously incapable of doing.  So here's the statement that's going out under your names. 
[00:37:00]  And they never word it right.  They always give stiff corporal words.  No.  No.  They never word it the way you want it worded.  Their damage control stinks.  Opie and Anthony were found nude and fired.  And here's another angle.  See, we try to do different angles than everybody else with this stuff.  The local news, you know, they all want you to watch their news program for your latest info on Heath Ledger's nude death. 
[00:37:30]  Nude death.  So listen to this crap.  No pills scattered.  No suicide note.  No hint of foul play.  It will be up to the medical examiner to say just how Heath Ledger died.  Local residents remember seeing him in the neighborhood with his daughter.  I always see him with his daughter.  That's why I'm so shocked.  He's always with his daughter.  Wait.  Always on his shoulders, like hopping around.  But why would that make you shocked?  Like if he wasn't with his daughter, you'd be completely expecting his pill naked death. 
[00:38:00]  But I would only see him with his daughter, which makes the fact that he is a mere mortal completely unbelievable to me.  And the odds of somebody in Hollywood dying of an overdose, I mean, it has to be two to one.  Perhaps more than that, Jim.  I mean, they're just local.  Why do they ever ask people?  I don't know.  Questions.  So dumb.  He wouldn't have killed himself if he didn't have a two-year-old.  Yeah.  Because no one does.  Because no one does that, right? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  And then you got Fox 5.  And this summer, Heath Ledger is set to star in the blockbuster sequel to the Batman series as the Joker.  The filming has been completed for that movie, but no one yet on whether the studio plans to release the movie as scheduled.  And make sure you stay with Fox 5.  Of course they will.  The death of Heath Ledger.  We will be sure to bring you information on his autopsy results as they come in.  See, they want you to stay with their news channel because they're going to have the scoop.  Yeah.  It's not like it's going to be info that everyone gets at the exact same time and they all read the same exact script like you heard with the new naked thing. 
[00:39:00]  Well, they were just showing it on our favorite CW11.  They showed Heath Ledger and said, stick with us for all the updates and blah, blah, blah.  What updates are they going to be?  He was nude.  What are they going to do different?  You know what I would do if I was the news director of CW11?  Cancel the program?  I would put the updates on Jill's cleavage.  Oh, wow.  During her traffic report. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Jill Nicolini would have the updates on her shirt.  She would pull down the shirt a little bit, keeping it FCC friendly.  Yeah.  But showing enough with the update across her ample bosom.  That would work.  That would make me watch their channel over all the other channels out there.  How about she says, and Jill Nicolini does the entertainment portion and goes, he was found nude.  And then she says, just like this. 
[00:40:00]  And just starts to strip right there on CW11 news.  Just in case you don't know what found nude means.  Yes.  We're going to have a demonstration.  And they set up a little bed.  Right.  And she can lay on the floor completely nude and reenact it.  Now that's, see, that would get people watching and explain the whole why you're saying nude thing.  Oh, yeah.  Well, according to the article Eric just brought up, Westboro Baptist Church will picket his funeral. 
[00:40:30]  Probably because he played a gay guy.  Oh, those loonies.  Yeah.  Yeah, they just love to picket the funerals of dead soldiers.  Yeah.  What they are basically, they're religious fanatics.  There's like 100 and 150 of them in the church.  And they just, they're so desperate for attention.  Yeah, it's not even a church.  It's like, it's like a cult.  It's a cult.  They're just, they're...  And they are just attention whores.  They really are.  I'm almost embarrassed for them in the sense that they're trying to be so outrageous.  And they're all smart though. 
[00:41:00]  They're not dummies.  They're lawyers.  They all have gone to law school.  At least a lot of them have.  Like the woman Sherry, whatever.  So they know they're right.  That makes sense though.  Yeah.  Lawyers are scum too.  Yeah.  But let's hope that somebody with a rifle and a scope just doesn't care.  You never know.  You never know.  I wouldn't be sorry about it.  That's for sure.  No, not at all.  If I heard that piece of crap got it.  I'm sure she's got plenty of enemies.  That's for sure.  There's a bunch of soldiers' families that had to go through her protesting their kids' funerals. 
[00:41:30]  With horrible signs.  Your son died.  He's burning in hell for defending homosexuals.  The woman's insane.  Lock her up.  Commit her.  Yep.  Thank you.  They're just irritating.  This just in.  Wow.  What?  Keith Ledger, dead, found nude at the foot of his bed. 
[00:42:00]  Nude?  Nude.  Like naked?  Exactly like naked.  Completely nude.  Sans clothes?  Sans clothes.  Completely devoid of clothing.  What a little.  All right.  We got more audio of the local news and how they're trying to get you to tune into their coverage.  Yeah.  One station is plugging their website for the latest info.  Another station is plugging their slideshow that they put together. 
[00:42:30]  Sombra music?  I like the somber music.  Yeah.  They're all a bunch of whores.  Yep.  They love when this stuff happens.  Don't let them fool you for a second like they care.  Do you think there are people out there still that really believe that one station would have info over another station?  No.  I mean, I know.  But yes, there are plenty of people that think about it.  And there's some websites like TMZ is ahead of the curve a bit, you know, ahead of everybody and other sites like that. 
[00:43:00]  But I think local news, they get the AP story and that's all they get.  They don't have detectives or anybody like, you know, fishing out the story.  The reporter with the little press thing in his hat.  Right.  Asking us what's going on.  I'm going to get this whole story right.  Jotting it down on a little pad.  So you say he was found nude, eh?  You want to see Heath Ledger nude?  There you go.  Where did that come from?  Travis just found a nude.  Travis?  Of Heath Ledger.  Where did that come from?  Wow.  He's in shape. 
[00:43:30]  He's a big boy considering it was.  What the hell is wrong with you, Travis?  Travis is the best at finding nude men pictures.  I googled Heath Ledger nude.  And that's what came up.  And I thought Eric might like to show it.  So everyone else could check him out nude?  Yeah.  Who doesn't want to see that?  Do you know where it's from?  The internet.  What movie?  No, I know it's from the internet, dummy.  What movie was he doing that in?  I have no idea.  That's pretty graphic.  That isn't even like Brokeback Mountain stuff. 
[00:44:00]  That's Foot of the Bed nude.  Wow.  All right.  We got to take our break here.  We got Super Bowl stuff to do today.  A lot of Boston fans who are being heard on BCN not happy that Tom Brady is hanging  out in New York City.  So what you're saying is that all of Boston is mad and they will turn on Tom Brady and  become Giants fans and vote and root for the Giants on Super Bowl Sunday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's exactly what's going to happen. 
[00:44:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Hi.  Hi.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We are absolutely nude.  Completely naked.  Wait.  Broadcasting for you.  For your pleasure.  Is that to pay tribute?  In the heart of nude York.  Nude York City.  We're in nude York City and we're naked.  Broadcasting to you.  Is that to pay tribute to Heath Ledger? 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  Who, thank God, all the news agencies have told us he was found nude.  Nude.  Because that is probably the most important part of the story.  Right.  It has to be because it was included in every newscast and every newsprint, every report.  They had to say he was nude.  The Australian-born actor's housekeeper found him dead, lying face down naked at the foot 
[00:45:30]  of his bed.  Found naked face down.  Ledger was lying face down naked.  Face down and naked at the foot of a bed.  Ledger was naked and lying face down at the foot of his bed.  Wait a minute.  Where was he found naked?  Um, I don't know.  They don't really say.  Yeah.  Why am I the only one naked?  You guys said we would do the next break naked.  Well, I just figured.  You're all naked and awkward and I thought you guys would be nude with me. 
[00:46:00]  I just figured I'd wait maybe the next break.  The next break you guys are going to get naked or what?  Jimmy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Finally.  All right.  Getting back to the local news angle because you have to have the local news angle, you  know, because they're very important.  Yes.  Soapy news shows.  Very important.  Yeah.  One lady's wearing a pink hat at the death scene.  She's making sure she looks all nice and pretty for everybody.  She's got to look good.  As she does her report.  So she's got a pink hat and a pink scarf. 
[00:46:30]  She should have done it nude.  He was found nude, like me, at the foot of his bed.  No, that's all right.  She was no looker.  Oh.  Well, here's the CW and this is their local angle.  All right, Patricia, thank you.  And be sure to stay with the CW 11 morning news all morning long for continuing coverage  on the shocking death of this young actor.  He was shocked.  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to have an entertainment expert from Life & Style  Weekly stop by live to talk about the life and death of Heath Ledger. 
[00:47:00]  An entertainment specialist.  There's a pink hat.  There's a pink hat.  In front of his apartment.  God almighty, who would, can the news, and it's not just CW, people can go online and  get anything before you get it.  Yeah.  There's no, who's going to sit for an hour to go, oh my God.  An entertainment specialist.  Let's get through some more commercials.  Don't go online.  I want to hear an entertainment specialist tell me what I could read in 30 seconds.  Right after the psychobabble about the weather, they're going to have an entertainment specialist 
[00:47:30]  on.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, Brokeback Mountain, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, up and  coming, blah, blah, blah, blah, Bill Gibson's son in Patriot, blah, blah, blah, blah.  All right, we get it.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Hey, we got an official statement from Tom Cruise.  Oh.  He says, it's sad I was not there, because we all know I'm the only one who could have helped  him.  Yes.  Tom Cruise's statement today.  Bling it, gig it, boop, boop.  Uh, and then you got, uh, this news program trying to get you to watch them for the Heath 
[00:48:00]  Ledger.  Uh-huh.  News.  Matilda's just two years old.  That's the very latest live from Soho this morning.  Tracy Strahan, today in New York.  It's such a sad story.  Tracy, thank you.  And there's more about Heath Ledger on our...  Why do you have to say the obvious, too?  It's such a sad...  Such a sad story.  Oh, that's her personal little thing.  She deems it sad, so...  Like, it could have went either way.  It could have been either a happy or sad story.  But now, we all understand it's a sad story, because she told us.  Where's the laughing reporters that can't keep the straight face during horrible stories? 
[00:48:30]  Heath Ledger was...  He was snoot at the foot of his bed.  And why are we attaching ourselves to this guy?  Why is it really sad?  Because we watched him on film.  So, what does that mean, though?  We know him.  No, let's say we don't know him.  We know the characters he's played.  But if you really think about it, why is it really sad?  Because he's a young actor that got to bang everything in sight? 
[00:49:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Are we sad because he leaves...  Including Jake Gyllenhaal.  Are we sad because he left behind a two-year-old?  Like, why are we really sad?  Why are we really sad?  We don't know him from a hole in the wall.  There's 28-year-old guys, you know, dying nude all over the place.  All over.  Nude.  Why are we sad for them?  Naked and nude.  That is odd.  We, uh...  Really are a nation of douches. 
[00:49:30]  Star-worshipping douches.  Yeah, yeah.  It's our royalty, Opie.  Celebrities are our royalty.  Well, this is what NBC locally is trying to do to get you to watch their coverage.  Such a sad story.  Tracy, thank you.  And there's more about Heath Ledger on our website, including more of that Jeffrey Lyons interview with the actor.  There's also a list of his films and images from his life.  Of course, log on to WNBC.com for more. 
[00:50:00]  Or IMDb.  They just want to get hits to their website.  We're so saddened by this.  We'd like to use it to direct traffic to our website.  Yes.  Yes, we would.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I put a big Foundry logo over his genitals on the nude photo.  So you can't see the nudity.  I got some inside info.  I was doing a lot of emailing last night.  And there's a strong possibility that he took his own life.  How do you figure that? 
[00:50:30]  Well, he was reading the script for Brokeback Mountain 2.  Oh, no.  What did that include?  A scene perhaps he didn't want to do?  Starring Yafit Kodo and himself.  Something about a sloppy party bottom.  It actually breaks his back.  All right. 
[00:51:00]  And then you got this local news station.  This is what they're trying to do to get you to watch them.  That was Christine Johnson reporting for more on the films and life of Heath Ledger.  We have a slideshow on our website.  Just go to WCVSTV.com.  Oh, slideshow.  You know what?  I got it.  I got it.  Slideshow.  I think I want a slideshow.  You want a slideshow?  I need to see a slideshow.  Yeah.  What else?  They have a View Master available from 1976.  3D.  Those douches.  We have a color form set that you can order off our website. 
[00:51:30]  How about just let people look online?  No one wants to go to your cheesy, corny website.  No.  And then finally, one more of these.  Another local news station.  This is their angle to try to get you to watch their coverage.  Very, very sad.  It is.  Heartbreak.  As we said, an autopsy is expected later today.  Stay with Eyewitness News for continuing coverage of Heath Ledger's tragic death.  You can also find the latest information on our website at 7online.com.  Direct traffic. 
[00:52:00]  They're directing traffic, but we're scums.  The other thing that was kind of funny about this, if you checked out Google Trends yesterday.  The other thing that was funny about this.  Sorry.  It's tragic.  Very sad news.  I think the local news thing is hilarious to me, what they do when it comes to these tragedies.  I checked out Google Trends yesterday, and the top 20 searches on Google was all about this.  But what was very funny was the number one trend was, of course, Heath Ledger. 
[00:52:30]  And number two was Keith Ledger.  Keith Ledger.  I guess his brother.  That was the second most searched thing yesterday.  Keith Ledger.  By complete dummies that didn't know his name was Heath.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I think it's sad that Heath and Keith Ledger died on the same day.  Same day.  And how bad for Keith Ledger, because no one's really going to be talking about him.  I haven't heard one report on Keith Ledger. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, can we do a search and see if there was a Keith Ledger that actually died yesterday?  And his family's like, God, I didn't know he was so popular.  All right.  Hey, we started the show with Anthony just ranting and raving about what?  The stupid cleft palate children ads that are on the back of every bus.  Yeah.  It's disgusting.  Yeah.  You know, I'm not even sorry.  I don't know what it is. 
[00:53:30]  It seems like third world countries love their cleft palates.  And it bothers you and it made you throw away your tasty banana cake.  I had a tasty banana cake that I had to throw away because I looked at the face of this monster child on the back of a bus.  And I pictured him biting it and getting, because there's no line, there's no palate between his mouth and his sinuses.  So, you know, that snot just drips in his mouth.  Yeah.  And that grossed me out thinking about it.  So, uh, I don't want to look at that on the back of the bus.  All right.  Well, Tim, put together some of your audio. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  When you were ranting and came up with this.  The music was going to be there.  Humanitarian Anthony Cumia is calling arms to help fight a problem affecting children across the country.  These little monstrous children with half of their upper lip and bottom of their nose missing.  The Anthony Cumia Fund for Cleft Palate Children is doing all it can to help treat newborns with hair lip and cleft palate.  Little predator faced monsters.  According to the Cleft Palate Foundation, one out of 700 births in the United States will result in cleft lip. 
[00:54:30]  Anthony Cumia sees this as an astounding statistic.  Send your money so they could sew that gaping hatchet wound shut on these kids' upper jaws.  Won't you give and help Anthony fight this debilitating deformity in children across the country?  It's the Cleft Palate Program for little kids.  Look at what we did.  We helped a little monster.  Be proud and say you gave to the Anthony Cumia Fund for Cleft Palate Children.  I'm Anthony Cumia and I endorse this Cleft Palate Program. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, he cut up my words.  No, he didn't.  He cut up my words.  Words hurt.  I don't endorse that.  I don't care.  I really don't care.  Just, I don't want to look at it.  Yeah.  All right.  Before we move on to your Super Bowl news, which we're going to do every day here on the Open Anthony Show.  Super Bowl nudes?  News.  Oh, news.  Sorry, I thought Heath Ledger had something to do with that.  By the way, Coke Logic, in honor of Heath Ledger's passing, he writes, in honor of Heath, 
[00:55:30]  I will be naked today.  I'm typing nude right now.  All right.  We hope more people will do that.  Just get nude.  That's what he would have wanted.  Yes.  That dumb thing.  Oh, that's just the worst.  I think if you talk to a dead person, I think what they really wanted was to still be alive.  Yeah.  Stop with the, that's what he would have wanted.  Maybe to not be dead.  Right.  What could these idiots be talking about? 
[00:56:00]  We're going to go on with the production because that's what he would have wanted.  Channel 5 now, Fox, is doing Heath Ledger life and career.  And they all look very somber.  And they're talking about Heath Ledger.  And the entertainment broad is in black.  She's dressed in black.  She did that on purpose, I'm sure.  Of course.  A little mourning.  Is that the other entertainment?  Yeah, she's in black.  She's in black, too, in mourning.  What the hell, man? 
[00:56:30]  Well, she's smiling, though.  These guys better be cutting up audio like crazy in the office.  We've got to mock these idiots.  I'm sure.  I don't want to mock it.  I think it should be taken seriously.  I want them shocked.  Yes.  By the way, bravo to Tom Brady.  Go, Pats, go.  Yeah.  It's me against Anthony and Norton.  Mm-hmm.  I want the Pats.  These guys want the Giants.  I think we kind of hinted at this yesterday. 
[00:57:00]  Maybe we didn't get it on the air, unfortunately, because then we would have looked like geniuses.  But we were talking about that foot thing on his foot.  Yeah, he had a big foot thing on his foot.  And we started thinking that maybe he was effing with the paparazzi.  Now they're starting to hint that he might have been effing with the paparazzi.  That is kind of funny.  Because they follow him around a lot.  And he's like, all right, look what I'm going to do now.  And really get everyone into a frenzy.  Get him talking.  Because then he was seen, I think, yesterday without the foot thing on his foot.  Yeah.  And he looks like he's okay. 
[00:57:30]  And he's hanging out at the top clubs in New York City.  Of course he is.  He's walking around.  He's an A-lister.  With his supermodel girlfriend.  And a lot of people in Boston not happy that Tom Brady is hanging out what they're calling enemy territory.  It's got to be a little weird, right?  You're the star quarterback of the Patriots.  And you're playing the Giants in the Super Bowl.  So what do you do?  You hang out in New York before the Super Bowl?  Well, let me ask you this.  Boston. 
[00:58:00]  You know I love you.  But what do you expect them to do?  Hang around in Boston?  Just get harassed?  Yeah, Tom Brady!  It's Tom Brady!  Like, New Yorkers, I think, are a little more savvy, at least in New York City, to not bugging celebrities.  Because they kind of walk all over the place around here.  And if you're in an exclusive restaurant or something or eating, you won't get bothered for the most part.  But Boston, forget about it.  That's what they were saying about Heath Ledger. 
[00:58:30]  That's why he moved to New York, because he could kind of go about his life nude.  Yeah, and no one would notice.  They were saying how he liked to just skateboard in the neighborhood and go to the local pizza joint.  And no one bothered the guy.  No one bugs him.  Because that's what they do in New York, I guess.  But a big headline today in the paper.  And I need the Boston Herald headlines, because I want to play it both ways here.  Because Boston's getting beat up, because we're only showing this angle today.  Give me some headlines from the Herald, please.  All right, Travis is on. 
[00:59:00]  Tom Loves New York is the headline today.  Brady Passion Play.  Playmaker Tom Brady is living like a playboy, high rolling with stunning gal pal Gisele.  At the city's hottest clubs, restaurants, and stores, instead of resting at his home in Quincy, Mass.  I think you should just stay home and rest, if you're going to be in the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  I really do.  Even if it's like not...  We're in a lot of movies.  Next three days.  Get some takeout.  Three days.  It's over...  It's another week. 
[00:59:30]  No, I mean, even if it's not within, like, three days, let's say.  If it was within three days, I could see stay home, rest, relax.  But before that, he's got time.  Might as well, you know, live it up a little bit.  I would just hang out in the nude for a week.  In the nude.  In the nude.  I would be very naked.  And fans in New England are calling his pre-Super Bowl romps in the Big Apple downright treason.  That's right.  Treason?  Yes.  He shouldn't be in enemy territory, complained Boston pharmacy worker Maria Faria. 
[01:00:00]  Maria Faria.  That's really her name.  It looks like her parents had a sense of humor.  Maria Faria.  Uh, and then you get, uh, what the hell is wrong with him, screamed, uh, Patriot fan  George, uh, Beattie, or Beattie, Beattie, Beattie.  Uh, I think it's crazy he's got enough money that he could have gone anywhere.  Mm-hmm.  Then you get, uh, this, uh, Brady walking around Manhattan is like Bush walking around downtown  Baghdad.  Wrote one fan.  Is it really?  Wrote one fan. 
[01:00:30]  Is somebody going to take Tom Brady and chop his head off?  Because that's what they would do to George W.  They probably would do it to Tom Brady, too.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, yeah.  That would be quite a statement.  And I think more people would be sad if, uh, Brady was headless than the president.  Just saying.  Just saying.  Just saying.  Uh, let's see.  Another ranted.  He said, I wouldn't put it past the some, the some, I wouldn't put it past the some 
[01:01:00]  nutjob Giants fans to pull a Tonya Harding.  Ugh.  Giants fans also ripped the star but said they understand why he's here.  I guess it shows how dead the nightlife in Boston is, said NYU student McGregor Gantier.  Uh-oh.  See, that's what it is, too.  New York is known for its nightlife.  The bars are open until four in the morning.  Later, if you're a celebrity.  In Boston, there's a two-foot rule in strip clubs.  Yeah.  You have to wave at strippers.  At one o'clock, they're telling you, you know, finish it up. 
[01:01:30]  Come on, you can't stay here.  You gotta go home.  Ugh.  It's annoying.  That's why he's here in New York.  Don't feel bad about it, Boston.  He just, you know, it's just kind of a better party city.  That's all.  Yeah.  I think it's a little weird, though.  I really do.  Yeah?  I think the fans take the Super Bowl way more serious than the actual players.  Yeah.  In the end, I really do. 
[01:02:00]  To them, it's, you know, it's big, but...  They want a ring, but they don't care that they're winning the ring for that particular city.  I really believe that.  I think the fans are way more hardcore than the actual players when it comes down to it.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the other thing, and this pisses me off.  It doesn't matter if you're a Giants fan or a Patriots fan.  I got this angle, and maybe someone could give me the other angle on this, too.  Guess how many...  He's a test.  Crap.  But seriously, guess how many season ticket holders that support the Giants all these years? 
[01:02:30]  You can't even get a season ticket for the Giants.  There's like a 10-year waiting list, or it's even longer than that.  It's ridiculous, right?  I mean, people put these tickets in their wills and all that.  You know, it's really hard to get season tickets for the Giants, okay?  So you got these guys that have been supporting the Giants for forever, for decades, for generations.  Guess how many people have a chance to go to the Super Bowl after supporting this team? 
[01:03:00]  Jim?  Two million.  Two million.  All right.  I'm going to bid lower.  One dollar.  I think he went over.  It's 5,500.  That's it.  5,500 people get to go to the Super Bowl if they're a season ticket holder.  5,500.  That stadium holds what?  70,000?  Million. 
[01:03:30]  70,000 million?  Is that amazing?  That is really bad.  Where does the rest go?  To corporate sponsors and all that crap.  Man.  It's just become a big corporate thing, man.  Some guy in the letters, letters to the editor section of one of the papers was bitching.  Sid, he went to Super Bowl III, and he's amazed that Super Bowl tickets, some of them are selling for upwards of $25,000 a piece. 
[01:04:00]  Wow.  And he bought from a scalper for Super Bowl III, two tickets for $18 a piece.  And he was outraged at the time that it cost so much.  Imagine two Super Bowl tickets, $18 each.  You know, I would splurge and get four.  Why not?  Just to tear up two.  Right.  So I'd have, like, some room next to me. 
[01:04:30]  Some elbow room.  Oh, my.  $18.  I've actually done that.  I got season tickets to the Islanders, and I got four.  And there are times that, you know, only two of us go.  So there's two empty seats next day.  I mean, little kids call all the time asking for you to take them, Opie.  And then people try to sit there, and I go, no, no, those are my seats.  My seats.  They're taken by nobody.  And they're like, but no one's sitting here.  I'm like, I know.  They're my seats, and that's how I want it.  Buffer zone.  Right. 
[01:05:00]  Out.  I've done it.  And the looks on their faces, like, but, but, what?  But there are empty seats.  Share.  No.  But you're not sharing.  No, I'm eating, you know, a few hundred dollars here, and I want to just put my coat on that seat, maybe.  Or my popcorn.  Hey, we did this yesterday, and no one gave a crap.  So I don't know why we're trying it today.  I know why we're trying it today, because it's going to lead to one of our favorite clips of all time.  Now, the game is, what, three or four days old now, but Coming to America predicted that the Giants were going to beat the Packers, 
[01:05:30]  and it was going to be a field goal.  Yep.  And this was back in, what, 1988, I believe, Coming to America came out?  Yeah.  This is actual audio.  We didn't cut it up.  We didn't edit it.  Most people know that, that know the movie.  But here's Eddie Murphy talking to the boss about the Giants beating the Packers by a Super Bowl, by a field goal, 20 years ago.  John Amos.  John Amos, right. 
[01:06:00]  The great John Amos.  What is it?  Sir, I was wondering, did you happen to catch the professional football contest on television last night?  No, I didn't.  Oh, it was most exhilarating.  The Giants of New York took on the Packers of Green Bay, and in the end, the Giants triumphed by kicking an oblong ball made of pigskin to a big H.  It was the most ripping victory.  That's been cut off.  I don't believe that.  Yeah.  That is weird. 
[01:06:30]  That's a bit weird, huh?  No?  That is odd.  I mean, but, you know, you pick two teams out of your, and say one wins by a field goal.  It's not the oddest thing that could happen.  It would have been weird if he said the Packers and the Yankees, and then it really happened.  And the men would play a cowboy and then be found nude with sleeping pills.  That would be weird.  Well, the reason we played that today, because now we have an excuse to play New York One's own Roger Clark, the Waldorf Astoria. 
[01:07:00]  It's one of the greatest examples of a swing and a miss joke-wise you're ever going to hear.  What's the setup on this?  It was something to do with the Waldorf Astoria, and the guy on the street made a joke referencing this movie.  Coming to America, right?  And the guy in the studio gave him nothing.  If you could give somebody less than a zero, less than, this guy actually gave him less than silence.  And here it is.  So that's what's happening, but the big story is traffic, Pat. 
[01:07:30]  You know, and every time I think of the Waldorf Astoria and I think of world leaders, I think of coming to America.  When James Earl Jones came to find Eddie Murphy, and he's like, where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  And that's where I guess the presidents get, so where else would you meet with world leaders other than the Waldorf Astoria?  It makes sense, right?  Yeah.  Foreign policy for the masses, I guess it is, Roger, right? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you've boiled it all down.  Presidents are busy with meetings.  Waldorf Astoria is a good place to meet.  Chock full of information.  And, of course, we know the traffic restrictions.  But we're going to put all this traffic information on our website as well because it's a lot to take in.  Roger, thank you.  What a bomb.  And he knew.  He knew.  He lost complete confidence.  He knew he bombed. 
[01:08:30]  Ah, yeah.  And thank God the guy back at the anchor desk just let him hang out there for a minute.  He let him hang for a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, great.  And he tried to get out of it like it wasn't a joke.  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  You know, because that's where presidents do go.  It's never good to explain.  And the guy said foreign policy for the masses.  Yeah.  Like you trying to make it a little accessible for everyone.  Yeah, yeah.  Your little pop culture joke. 
[01:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, that's good.  All right.  We're going to continue our nude broadcast after the break.  Nude.  There's a lot of read coming up, so let's just get there.  Oh.  Fans look forward to it.  Do it naked.  I'll do it in my underpants.  Okay.  You have to take our word for it.  When Jimmy says he's going to do something in his underpants, he's really going to do  it in his underpants.  So when you hear Jimmy in a couple minutes here, he will be almost completely nude.  Wow.  I'll be in my underpants.  Right. 
[01:09:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We're your official Heath Ledger death show.  Yes.  Stay here for all the details.  Opie and Anthony.  Nude death.  This very naked death.  Yes.  Perhaps more naked than anyone has ever died before.  That's what they're starting to say.  We're sending some of our people down there to do some of that on the street stuff.  Man on the street stuff. 
[01:10:00]  Man on the street.  I think we're sending Matt.  He does a pretty good job out there.  Get him down there in front of the Soho apartment.  Yeah.  Broom Street.  421.  I think.  Really?  Is it?  I think so.  They had to give the exact address where the nude body of Heath Ledger was found.  Yes.  It is really sad.  I mean.  But it's also just ridiculous.  The coverage anyway.  Before we get back to the Heath Ledger thing, a couple other things happening.  And Amy Winehouse enters rehab after being caught smoking crack. 
[01:10:30]  I don't get it.  I don't get why she's in the news so much.  Like the papers, the Post and the Daily News here in New York.  And I'm sure your local rag, perhaps.  She's in there every day.  And I just don't get why.  Like why does anyone give a crap what the hell she's doing?  I think because we like train wrecks.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Is that it?  I enjoy a good train wreck.  That's why I can't get enough of the Britney Spears thing. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  Britney's different though.  She's kind of this.  She was like really huge.  Really just huge.  Like I don't think Amy Winehouse is big enough for us to really give a crap if she's doing crack or not.  Dude.  Who cares?  What about might as well go to rehab?  Yeah.  That's about it.  I know.  There you go.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Yes, I've been back.  But when I come back, no, no, no. 
[01:11:30]  Who cares though?  I ain't got the time.  And if my daddy thinks I'm fine.  You like this song, Jimmy?  Do you like it?  She doesn't want to go, though.  Listen.  Go, go, go.  All right.  Listen.  She won't go.  Where's the guy that says, and that's how you executive produce?  Because he knew we were going to be talking about Amy Winehouse today.  So why wouldn't you get all the Amy Winehouse material together?  Didn't we have Kenny or somebody sing rehab? 
[01:12:00]  That's what we want to hear today.  I can't wait to start firing.  It's going to be fun.  Fun.  Reorganizing this whole mess.  Don't we have Kenny singing rehab?  I think we do.  All right.  Let's get it on the radio.  Let's go.  Also, Ringo Starr, this is very interesting.  He walks off Regis yesterday.  I love this.  First of all, Ringo is the most pompous douche ever. 
[01:12:30]  He's one of the Beatles.  No, no, no, no.  He played drums for the Beatles.  He backed up the Beatles by playing drums.  Anyone could have sat in, and did eventually, and do a better job than Ringo Starr at playing drums.  He wasn't the favorite.  He wasn't really the one everyone thought was the talented one. 
[01:13:00]  But he's the one now milking the whole thing and trying to get the most out of it.  He's going to be the last man standing.  He really is.  Who saw that coming?  I did years ago.  Did you?  I got Ringo Starr in the Beatles' death poll.  Did you?  Poll, poll, poll.  Yes.  Well, this idiot decides he's going to go on Regis, which is fine.  He's a Beatle.  But he wants to do a song that is over four minutes long.  What was it?  Four and a half minutes about? 
[01:13:30]  When they did rehearsal, it was about five, a little over five.  A little over five minutes long.  What kind of crap is that?  Self-indulgent douche.  Yeah, but Regis, the people over there, they're pretty self-indulgent, too, because they got a rule.  This is where they had their conflict, that no performance should be over two and a half minutes.  And why not?  That's probably a good rule.  It's a stupid rule.  You ever watch Regis and Kelly?  Regis will spend ten minutes at the start of the show talking about how he had dinner at some nice restaurant in New York. 
[01:14:00]  That was wonderful.  And then shows pictures of his stupid daughter at some dumb function.  We talked about Notre Dame.  I love Notre Dame.  We know you love Notre Dame.  Shut up about Notre Dame.  And see, my point is if I thought they were actually getting something done on that show.  Tragic news today, as we look at the newspapers, the covers of the papers, a death in Hollywood.  Heath Ledger has died, and he was nude! 
[01:14:30]  He was nude and found at the foot of his bed!  They just babble is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, they babble for a long time.  So let Ringo do five minutes on your stupid TV show.  But that's what their stupid, like, I wouldn't watch it, but that's what their stupid audience wants to see.  Is Regis and Kelly kvetching over the news, and Heath Ledger, and whatever else is in the news that day.  They don't want to see Ringo Starr, Richard Starkey, sitting there for five minutes playing a song. 
[01:15:00]  It's not a Beatles song.  What is it?  What if it was, like, Yellow Submarine or something?  Oh, then you really don't want to see it.  We all live in it, do ya?  Exactly.  Do we have that song?  I'd like to hear a piece.  I sailed the sea.  Then I got a job.  In a factory.  Oh!  In a Brooklyn's camp.  With my friend Rory. 
[01:15:30]  Rory.  It was good for him.  Me?  Straight for me.  Yeah.  Liverpool, I left you.  Said goodbye to Madron's dreams.  I always followed my heart.  And I never missed a beat.  Oh, God.  He is the...  You know, when you have, like, Lennon... 
[01:16:00]  And McCarthy.  No, I was going to say Lennon and Marx writing their communist manifesto.  When you have Lennon and McCartney as writers...  You go and make the coffee.  Yeah.  Just shut up while the geniuses work.  If I was Lennon, I'd be like, Ringo, could you get another pot of coffee going?  We're going to be a while tonight.  Me and Paul are really working hard here.  Would you like me to help?  I can write about me and you and... 
[01:16:30]  All right.  No, go here.  No, please.  Here's a...  Could you wait for the...  Could you wait for the takeout guy?  Yeah.  Our Chinese food should be arriving soon.  He should be coming to the door.  Could you get that, Ringo?  Anyway, so...  Then Gellman from Regis and Kelly...  He goes, all right.  He's now negotiating with Ringo.  Who I suspect is a closeted homosexual.  Gellman.  He goes, look, it's supposed to be two and a half minutes. 
[01:17:00]  We'll give you two minutes and 45 seconds.  Two 45.  That was the bargain they made with Ringo.  And Ringo's like, you know what?  F you.  And he walked off the show and now it's big news today.  He was acting like it was 1967 is what he was acting like.  And that, you know, he was still in the whole Beatles glow.  And he was being a prima donna.  Yeah.  They can't have this idiot getting up there and singing a song for five minutes. 
[01:17:30]  No one does that.  No one does as pompous enough to throw out a five-minute song and then want to perform  it on live TV.  Right.  Oh, I don't care.  Is he leaving?  Good.  He's gone.  I'd have rather had old Puddin' Head in here.  Get old Puddin' Head's hat.  Sit it in the chair with some pudding in it.  Well, you know, because timing's everything on the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Of course it is.  And I guess as a listener, you've got to work a little harder when you listen to this 
[01:18:00]  show.  Yeah, you really do.  So remember when we were talking about Amy Winehouse about ten minutes ago?  Do you remember?  Amy Winehouse is going to be on the program, Kelvin.  That's when we should have played this.  They try to take 8-0 to rehab.  I said no, no, no.  No?  Yes, I've been black.  But when I come back, you won't know, no, no.  I ain't got the time. 
[01:18:30]  If my daddy thinks I'm fine, he's trying to take me to go to rehab.  I won't go, go, go.  I'd rather be at home with Ray.  I ain't got 70 days.  Because there's nothing, nothing you can teach me 
[01:19:00]  That I can learn from Mr. Hathaway  Did I hear it?  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  Thank you, Roland.  What a rendition.  You know what?  Regis was being, his people were being douches.  They were?  Yeah.  See, I see Ringo as the douche. 
[01:19:30]  No, I see Jimmy's way.  I tell you one thing.  The statement released by Ringo's people, the guy, his steward, was four minutes, three  minutes, 40 seconds, actually.  It seemed like an appropriate amount of time for a former Beatle.  Mr. Gellman apparently felt Ringo's musical legacy should take a backseat to additional  banter about the size of Miss Ripper's derriere.  And you know what?  When you look at it like that, it's not like they were stepping on another artist by having 
[01:20:00]  Ringo.  It's just crap, garbage banter.  And this guy, if there's four of them, two are alive, they changed music forever.  If you can't give that guy an extra minute, ah, you know what?  More crap.  He was the crappy Beatle, though.  Paul McCartney, they'd have let McCartney play a 10 minute song if McCartney was on  there.  Yeah.  I think so.  But it's just so pompous that Ringo goes in there and says he's going to take five minutes 
[01:20:30]  of a show, regardless of what they're talking about, stupid Kelly Ripa's ass, you know.  But that's what that show is about.  That's what the people tune into.  They don't tune in to see Ringo do a five minute song.  It's like this dopey show that we're sitting on.  If people tune in apparently to hear us ramble on about nonsense.  If we had some jerk off come in here that wants to, you know, do a five minute song.  How many minutes would we give Ringo?  An hour. 
[01:21:00]  Ringo we would give a long time because, you know, we're desperate.  We would allow him to do his version of In a God of Davida if he wanted to.  Whatever Ringo wants, Ringo would get here.  Should I have went with Greengrass and High Tights Forever?  The live version, yes, of course.  The live version is longer.  Free Bird.  Live?  Yeah.  Then the joke would have.  In memory of Elizabeth Reed.  Live.  Live, of course.  Unlike Heath Ledger.  Wow.  Who was found?  Nude.  Very nude.  Dead at the foot of his bed.  Yeah. 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  I don't know.  I just think it's a little pompous of Ringo to go in there and expect.  Even though he's a former Beatle.  He's the Beatle that they overdid his tracks.  Yeah, but I'm.  Yeah, when he played drums, they went good.  Ringo, go home.  And then they had a drummer come in and redo his drum tracks.  So he's not the guy in a lot of those songs?  Stinks.  Rumor has it.  Oh, after like.  There might be somebody else there, Jimmy.  After the, you know, I want to hold your hand phase, it was over for Ringo. 
[01:22:00]  Things like on Sergeant Pepper and Rubber Soul, things like that.  Yeah.  They went with other people.  What happened to Pete Best?  Why did he actually?  Because he was even worse than Ringo, I think.  And he was a douchebag.  And he might have been.  Oh, I can't say that.  He might have been a homosexual with John Lennon, too.  Was he?  Are there rumors of him being a homosexual?  Really?  I don't know.  Oh.  There's all sorts of rumors about. 
[01:22:30]  Get him on.  Pete Best.  Actually, it wasn't.  Pete Best wants to do a 10-minute song, Gelman.  Or it was that other dude, Sutcliffe.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Stuart Sutcliffe.  Stuart Sutcliffe.  Sutcliffe?  He might have been the rumored homosexual with John Lennon.  They said there was some, I don't know.  John Lennon seems like.  They had an interesting relationship.  John Lennon seems like the kind of guy that would just kind of, you know, whatever the  hell is thrown across his transom.  Yeah.  He'd pull the skin back, clean it with your tongue.  With your tongue. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, look at Yoko.  That's as close to a man as you could get and technically not be a homosexual.  Man, she is just.  Gruesome.  Never was good, right?  No.  The other thing about Regis, which is really funny.  Like, he gets paid.  How many?  Afro wars.  How many millions does Regis get to do that TV show?  I don't know, but a lot.  Regis is one of the highest paid people.  Or at least he was when he was doing a millionaire show. 
[01:23:30]  You ever actually watch the show and go, what does he do?  He banters about where he ate dinner the night before.  Talks about Notre Dame.  Yeah.  A little of that psycho battle.  And then when he finally does an interview, has anyone else noticed all he does now, he  gets like 10 or 12 photographs?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Name a really big star.  John Travolta.  Okay.  John Travolta.  And then he just shows John Travolta in movie roles.  It's like, here you are in Saturday Night Fever. 
[01:24:00]  How was that?  When you were dancing and you called that woman the C word.  I love that part.  Here you are in Pulp Fiction.  And that's all he does.  And then the...  Say it in the C word!  And then the guest just kind of comments about the pictures he's looking at.  Yeah.  And that's how Regis interviews people.  And he gets paid millions to do this.  Now you were doing the disco dancing in this.  Me and my wife, what's her name?  Joy.  Joy.  We like doing the disco dancing. 
[01:24:30]  So I would do what you did on that light up floor.  And then I went down to the dancing school.  And I called the woman in the C word.  She was a ballerina.  And then my friend Gelman jumped off a bridge.  Wearing platform shoes.  Because I didn't call him after he got in my car.  Or I took his car.  And then we beat up the Puerto Rican.  I'm with you. 
[01:25:00]  I'm following the law.  Go ahead.  Saturday night.  I had a fever.  I had to go to bed.  I was very sick.  Don't touch my hair!  Hey, Bobby D.  Staying alive with open heart surgery.  Bobby D writes, hey, you guys gave Finger Eleven 45 minutes yesterday.  And they're not even close to being as legendary as Ringo. 
[01:25:30]  You happy?  You happy now?  Now you're a c***.  Wow.  Wow.  With that T.  Regis is very angry.  Wow.  With that T.  Hey, Double J.  Did you bang her?  Regis makes 20 million a year.  20 mil?  To babble about Notre Dame, where he ate last night.  And he'll talk about how he got a great table.  And then he'll show pictures.  He'll do a little picture show.  And then the guest is done.  God, is he a bore.  Yeah, but that's that audience. 
[01:26:00]  That's what they want.  They love listening to him babble.  Yeah.  Yeah, just the executives, the micromanage everything.  They're so afraid what the extra minute of the Ringo song is going to lose their audience.  Yeah.  Just a bunch of micromanaging douches.  I'll agree with that.  You've got to cut it down and force it because the ratings show, the extra minute of the banter  is going for ratings.  They're just irritating.  You know, marketing research is shown. 
[01:26:30]  That's it for you.  Steve from Bayshore.  Hey, Ringo, what was the deal with that Brian Epstein?  Was that Jew hot for John or what?  All right, look, we've got to take a break.  And we haven't talked about Heath Ledger nude or naked in the last 15 and 20 minutes.  We're going to lose our audience.  So let's get back to the Heath Ledger thing after the break. 
[01:27:00]  We are your exclusive site for entertainment news on the Heath Ledger tragedy.  Yeah.  He was found dead in his apartment.  Nude.  Nude.  Yes.  Naked at the foot of his bed.  Nude.  Nude and naked.  Yes.  At the same time.  At the same time.  Which is incredible.  Is that confirmed?  My God.  Wow.  Yes, it is.  That's rather saucy.  My God.  Grr.  Oh, this thing.  That is very, very saucy.  Yes. 
[01:27:30]  My God.  Also, Sam in his afro has entered the studio.  Sam.  Wow.  Hey, Gabe Kaplan.  What are you having to say?  Mr. Cotta.  Oh, yeah.  Up your nose with a rubber hose.  Here you are.  And welcome back, Cotta.  With Epstein.  Or is that Freddy Booba Washington?  Or a mix of the two?  A conglomerated mulatta mongrel.  That afro is terrific. 
[01:28:00]  We're in the middle of afro wars with Ron and Fez.  And I do believe we're kicking their ass.  But anyway, Sam, what do you have for the show?  Oh, I just brought in what Fox is going...  They told us to stick around for all the Heath Ledger coverage to Fox 5, so I wanted  to see what they were doing when they were going over his life.  And they really, I mean, I'm glad that I did, because they have all the inside information.  They do, huh?  Yeah.  You learned a lot.  Yeah.  Stuff you couldn't learn off of IMDB or anything like that, I'm sure.  No.  I mean, they had the sources for this information. 
[01:28:30]  Wow.  Okay.  And we got some highlights of that?  All right, we'll do that after the break.  Nice.  See, that's what we do.  Now we teased it, so now people have to stick around.  Nude, naked, nude.  Nude.  Nude.  Nude.  Nude.  Is that really your website?  Nude.  It's an old shirt, isn't it?  And we'll explain that next, too.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, thanks for checking us out today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You all right, Jimmy? 
[01:29:00]  We get breaks here, and I just wasted mine.  I went down the hall to Tracy to say, why would he dump the line I had about, I just  said, pull the skin back, which is not graphic, about John Lennon.  And so Eric had come to me, and he went, one dump, pull the skin back.  I'm like, why would he dump that?  I was very careful.  I didn't say anything, referencing any part of the body or anything, any act, blah, blah, 
[01:29:30]  blah, blah.  So I went down to Tracy.  I'm like, why would he dump that?  That's a context thing.  So I talked to him for 10 minutes, and then I go to him, and I go, dude, why'd you dump  that?  He goes, I didn't dump that.  I'm like, what do you mean?  He goes, no, I dumped, and he told me the word he dumped, which we all knew he was going  to dump.  When, you know, we don't agree that it should be, but he has to, because we understand that  that's what he's been told.  So thanks to that stupid misinformation, just 10 minutes of my life, wasted.  So Tracy, if you're hearing this, just disregard our entire conversation, because he did the 
[01:30:00]  right thing, and I was just told by a boy with Down syndrome that something was dumped.  How did you do it?  How did that happen?  When you said that, I asked him, I said, dumped, and he goes, yes.  So I assume that when you made that comment, that's what he dumped out of.  Oh, how about this?  You just said dumped?  How about this?  When it comes to this show, don't assume anything.  I have a good look.  You don't have the brain power for assuming.  I have a good one about assume.  Do you know what happens when you assume?  Things get tangled. 
[01:30:30]  All right, listen, we've got to get back to Heath Ledger, and then we've got a song that's  going to make people literally drive off the road.  That is an awful little song.  We've got a thumbs up on this, so that's very, very good.  So we're back to Sam.  Sam's in studio.  Everyone's talking about Heath Ledger being found nude and naked and dead.  Yeah.  Let's not forget the dead part.  Well, that's secondary to the nude and naked part.  And obviously it's a tragedy, and we acknowledge that, but it's also just ridiculous what's  going on with this coverage.  And you've got an example of that, right?  All day.  Well, yeah.  Fox decided to spend a long time talking to somebody from page6.com as if they had some 
[01:31:00]  sort of inside scoop.  Did they?  It was good, right?  Yeah, I mean, it really got all the information out that I couldn't have gotten at any of  the other networks or websites.  Are you glad you stuck with him?  I am.  Good.  He's being sarcastic douche today, too.  It's sarcastic douche Wednesday.  Yeah.  Is it?  Uh-oh.  Here we go again.  Here we go again.  Great.  Another theme day.  I love these.  I get it. 
[01:31:30]  You were being the sarcastic douche guy.  No, I really wasn't.  No, you were.  Mark your calendar.  Game back on.  Game on.  Game back on.  Anyway, so this is what Sam came up with.  Well, the first one, quick clips.  In the same sentence, the woman says New York was great because Heath was a very private  person.  And then she also says in the same sentence, but New York adopted him and Michelle Williams  as a celebrity couple.  Adopted?  By all accounts, he lived in Brooklyn with Michelle Williams because they were the kind 
[01:32:00]  of people who wanted to be.  What does by all accounts?  That's by every single account.  They've taken all the accounts, and this is the summary.  Of all of them.  Can't you just say he lived in Brooklyn by all accounts?  By all accounts.  They taught me that in journalist school.  Just add things at the beginning of things, like by all accounts.  Makes it sound more important.  Yes.  By all accounts.  What?  What? 
[01:32:30]  What they did was they took a tally of all accounts.  Right.  And the summary of said accounts is.  And then what follows.  Yes.  Now, by all accounts, meaning without exception.  Right.  Every account.  You didn't say by most accounts.  Has been accounted for.  Yes.  But I think if you say by all accounts, you're leaving the door open just slightly that it  might not have been true.  But by all accounts.  Yeah.  But it's not.  You know what I mean?  There might be an account out there that he didn't find.  That's what I'm saying.  Right.  By all the accounts that he was able to come upon. 
[01:33:00]  But there are other accounts out there that he wasn't able to explore yet.  Well, how about this?  In lieu of facts.  He's basically what I'm saying.  By all accounts.  A complete fabrication.  What we've heard is.  That's the news way of saying what we've heard is.  He should have said according to the post office.  By all accounts, he lived in Brooklyn with Michelle Williams because they were the kind  of people who wanted to be out of the spotlight.  They could have afforded to live in a high rise in the center of Manhattan. 
[01:33:30]  They were very private people.  And I think that that's what was so great.  In New York, we sort of adopted them as a New York celebrity couple because they were  one of the first couples.  Can I take a correction?  I have to.  I hate to say it.  I had no idea that he lived in New York until he turned up naked and dead.  Of course.  I had no idea.  No clue.  Most people had no clue.  And I didn't get my adoption papers.  No.  I didn't accept this adoption.  He was adopted by New York.  As a celebrity couple. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  Something.  Do we have a choice in these matters?  Isn't it like, oh, wow, look, a big, big celebrity living in my neighborhood.  Oh, that's kind of cool.  Anyway, you want to go to Starbucks and get an overpriced coffee?  Can I adopt you?  No.  By any account?  No.  No.  It was so great.  In New York, we sort of adopted them as a New York celebrity couple because they were  one of the first couples to move out to Brooklyn.  They have a beautiful, beautiful townhouse there.  And he has said he just could not handle the celebrity attention. 
[01:34:30]  Did he say that?  I think he did.  By all accounts.  My probably going to be ex-girlfriend is friends with someone who dated the woman.  And she told me about his place in Brooklyn.  And she actually did say they were private.  Really?  And they liked it there because it was quiet.  Well, that's another account.  That was by all accounts, plus one.  But if he hated being a celebrity, so just walk away from it.  They didn't say that. 
[01:35:00]  They said he hated being in the spotlight.  All right.  And I would hate that, too, because you're walking around.  You can't sleep.  There's a big spotlight on you.  And you're like, stop.  Could you turn the spotlight off?  My eyes are shut.  And it's just still bright.  Yeah.  Very bright and hot.  Now that you explained it.  Yeah, they didn't say a celebrity.  It was being in the spotlight, which would be annoying.  My hack community theater line doesn't need to be spoken at this point.  Exactly.  By all accounts.  No, that's okay, Jimmy. 
[01:35:30]  And he said the worst part of living in the spotlight was the moths.  He would try to sleep and it'd be moths.  Moths love being in the spotlight.  He didn't.  They would just look like morons.  They would just flutter on your skin.  Yeah.  Forcing you to pop more sleeping pills to fall asleep.  Very annoying.  Take your clothes off because it's hot because you're under the spotlight.  Right.  Hence his nudity.  Hence then.  By all accounts, his nudity.  And a moth will tickle you.  More importantly. 
[01:36:00]  Would a moth tickle your ball bag in a way that would make you kind of giggle?  I could tell you that by experience.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I remember a story told a long time ago, though.  When my brother, Joe, would do awful things to me.  Not like that.  Not hot awful.  But just like, you know, a big brother to little brother.  And one time he caught a bunch of moths and had them in a jar and decided it would be funny 
[01:36:30]  because he watched cartoons.  Now, the influence of cartoons on young children.  What did moths do in cartoons?  They ate through material and clothing.  Oh, right.  Okay.  That's what they would do.  And you'd see it like...  And the sweater would disappear.  Know why they would do that, by the way?  Why?  A little known fact.  Why?  To get to the cock.  You can't...  What day is this? 
[01:37:00]  If there was any chance a rooster would be under material, then I could understand your  logic there.  Right.  Let's say the rooster cage has a sheet on it.  Yeah.  And the moths were getting to...  I could understand that.  Okay.  Well, this not having a boss is a lot of fun.  A little tricky.  But my brother, having seen that in cartoons, assumed that he could take a jar full of moths, 
[01:37:30]  shove them down the back of my underwear, and it would be funny when they ate through  my underwear.  Ah.  In, you know, an instant.  Yeah.  And they didn't.  So I had fluttering moths in my underwear that quickly perished.  This is when I was about, I guess, maybe five.  Did you laugh?  Or six.  No, I cried.  I cried at everything.  Moths are in my underwear.  Mommy.  Mommy. 
[01:38:00]  What the hell is he crying about now, Ro?  Joey, shut up.  Joseph put moths down his underwear.  Tell him not to do that.  Ah, what is it, kid?  The kid's got a man up.  Look at him.  He's crying over moths.  I don't want you crying like that unless there's wasps down your underwear.  And even then, oh, Joey, I got a stomachache.  You know how the moths got killed, right?  What?  Underpants.  What?  What happened?  I picture, like, Godzilla and that big tail of his just killing things. 
[01:38:30]  Are you saying a monster tail hit my butt?  My little five-year-old buttocks?  No, I'm not saying that at all.  Oh.  The monster might have been attached to young Anthony Cumia.  What?  See, thank you.  Jeepers.  I was actually giving you a compliment on your, uh, on your...  Oh, no, not at that age.  You know, just your average little boy. 
[01:39:00]  All right, let's get back to this.  So Fox 5 gets the inside scoop, like Sam was telling us.  The page six woman continues, thinks it's funny that a lot of people are sad.  Michelle Williams has been reported to be just devastated.  Really?  It's reported that she's devastated?  Reported.  I heard it's been reported that she was a bit jovial.  Yeah.  If they had any sense of humor, what they would have done is reported to be just devastated,  then you showed old party footage of her, like, dancing with a martini and laughing.  Laughing it up.  Having a B-A-L-L.  Yucking it up. 
[01:39:30]  Michelle Williams has been reported to be just devastated.  Um, you know, as everyone is.  I mean, it's funny.  Everyone.  All of the celebrity, um, the celebrity news sources have been going out and speaking  to everyone.  Reports said that Naomi Watts and Sundance started crying hysterically.  Um, I mean, this is, this is going to affect a lot of people.  Wow.  How is it going to affect a lot of people?  She's given some examples.  Michelle.  What, are movies going to now be $100 a ticket because of this death? 
[01:40:00]  Like, explain why this affects a lot of people.  Just means someone in Hollywood moves up, uh, moves up.  Jorge Posada was in the dugout.  I know.  He was crazy.  What?  Pennant's frowning.  He already knew.  Pennant was frowning.  Yeah.  Michelle won't be seeing me again soon.  The signs, nude people in the crowd.  Oh, my God.  Fox 5 Report thinks, uh, he's got an inside scoop because he met Heath back in 1998. 
[01:40:30]  10 years ago.  Just a personal note, having covered his career over the years as an entertainment reporter,  I was in Seattle in 1998.  They were filming 10 Things I Hate About You, and the attention was on the kid from Third Rock.  Heath Ledger was a relative unknown, though there was buzz about him.  He was a kid of few words then.  He seemed to save it for his performance when he was on the screen, taking a turn this way  and that way, playing a gay cowboy in one theater and Casanova in the other at the same time.  Wow.  That's pretty.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Yeah, two movies out at the same time. 
[01:41:00]  That's also an interesting way to bring back the fact that you were there in 98.  Yeah.  And I'd say nothing about him personally that we didn't know.  I like that.  Tying yourself into the story, much like Jimmy did with his girlfriend and the apartment  in Brooklyn.  Well, to be very honest, let me say the difference.  Yes.  Yeah.  I'm known for that.  Oh, that's true.  There's not a tragedy that I won't marry.  Not my resume.  Anyway, I was there.  I had something to do with it.  Even if I wasn't. 
[01:41:30]  Six degrees of Heath Ledger.  And I don't know him.  I never met him.  But again, my girlfriend slash ex-girlfriend knows a guy who is dating the girl that has  his baby now.  Uh-huh.  I was talking about the, um...  Actually, she's the one that married herself to it.  I'm just repeating her boring story.  But you...  Hence the reason she's your ex now.  You get married to it because, you know...  By marriage.  And now I'm as married to it as you are because you told me and I work with you. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, believe me.  I'm going to be telling this story later today.  You know, let me tell you something.  I'll touch myself to this.  You know, Jimmy Norton, the guy we work very closely with.  That we're really good friends with.  Wow.  His girlfriend knew this guy that went out with the girl that Heath Ledger had the baby  with.  Yeah.  And she's like, uh...  I'm right there.  I got to get to the funeral.  Quick.  My girlfriend had to tell me that she had walked by the apartment a few times and it  was like, you know, really nice.  I didn't realize she was doing that until just now. 
[01:42:30]  Stop marrying yourself to it.  You're not a big part.  You're not an integral part of the story.  She's acting like she was the masseuse who found him naked.  I walked by the apartment in 1999.  Did you?  What was that masseuse all about, by the way?  Oof.  What the hell was he going for?  Why?  What's his problem?  Problem?  Problem?  I don't know, man.  Was there a guy?  No.  No, masseuse.  I'm sure.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I, uh...  They're all just masseuses.  I don't know.  I think something's going to come out as far as this masseuse. 
[01:43:00]  I think?  Yeah.  Happy ending?  She didn't look like she was on the up and down.  Is she pretty?  Oof.  Oof.  Not probably real, then.  A bruiser?  Oof.  Yeah, real.  Oof.  Hey, they reflect on a recent interview.  Fox 5 Report says his death is sad because?  Because?  Anybody?  Anyone?  Uh...  Found nude?  Uh, because he was...  So young?  Um, wait.  Yes?  Yes, it's promised.  Young?  Young?  He touched so many people.  Eh?  He had a cool accent. 
[01:43:30]  Eh?  He was a good kisser in the cowboy movie.  Spit in his hand?  He spit in his hand.  I don't know, because he can improv better than I obviously am at this moment.  Let's go to Jared.  Jared in Boston.  Jared Reeve.  Listening on BCN.  Jared.  Keith Legg is in a pine box.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The scene here.  On Broob Street.  Keith is in a pine box.  Announcing he's naked and dead. 
[01:44:00]  So here's why it's so sad.  He said something that was very different for him.  He was talking about how having Matilda had changed his life, and it was a very telling  thing that he said.  He said it was a catch-22.  He could die because he had Matilda to live for him, but he didn't want to ever die because  he would want to be with Matilda the rest of his life.  We've heard that interview this morning.  It's so sad, because he was so young, obviously, and so talented. 
[01:44:30]  Anyway, thanks very much.  So if he wasn't talented, it would be less sad?  Yes.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, the death thing is weird.  We talk about it during the Oscars every year.  They show the montages of people that died in the past year, and dead people actually  get bigger applause than other dead people.  I always found that really bizarre.  Yeah, some dead people are very popular.  You get polite applause.  All these people are dead.  They died.  Polite applause.  Oh, Walter Matthau.  Big applause.  Oh, big, big.  Then back down to some unknown. 
[01:45:00]  Known set designer.  Right.  All right.  We got our own reporter down on the scene.  Actually, on Broom Street, downtown, where Heath Ledger was found, face down.  Nude.  Nude, right.  Naked nude.  Matt.  Matt, the intern.  How are you, Matt?  I'm good.  How are you, sir?  Well, paint the picture for us.  What's going on down there on Broom Street?  Well, right now, there's about three camera crews standing in front of the building where  he was reportedly found nude. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  There's maybe three people walking by.  Three.  I see some flowers out in front.  There's maybe two bouquets.  Yeah.  And a candle I saw on the news.  This is like on every channel.  Yeah.  It's a huge news story, and three people are there.  Yes.  And they're all just having to pass by taking pictures on their camera phones.  Mm-hmm.  And that's about it.  Are you doing some man-on-the-street interviews or what? 
[01:46:00]  Yes, I will be.  All right.  We're going to listen to that audio tomorrow on the show.  Yes.  All right, Matt.  And that's the scene.  See?  It's just crazy down there.  It's pandemonium.  I love the fact that they're photographing it with their camera phones.  They're just going to bore their friends.  Yeah, you do.  I walked by Heath Ledger's place.  What happened?  Look at this.  Whoa.  It's what I saw on the news.  Yeah.  But not as clear.  Do you guys want to hear a really good radio tease?  Okay.  Uh, sure.  If you wait through the commercials, we'll explain this. 
[01:46:30]  Stop it, daddy.  Daddy, stop it now.  I want you to tell on you now.  Oh.  All right.  That's all you get.  Nice.  That's all you get.  That's all you get until we get back.  Fascinating.  All right.  I have a good thing to promote, too. 
[01:47:00]  What's that, Jimmy?  I'll be giving out my MySpace page when we come back.  It's all about Facebook now.  Don't you know that, Jimmy?  Can't have as many friends on Facebook.  I don't deal with that.  Why?  I don't know.  There's a limit to friends.  Am I wrong?  More people?  How many can you have?  Like 5,000.  So what good does that do me to promote?  5,000?  I think so.  That's stupid.  Of course it is.  More people are signing up for Facebook than MySpace officially, though.  Probably because I don't even have MySpace.  Yeah.  True.  Do you think that's the reason?  Mm-hmm.  And the spam.  Stats.  I should have known.  Spam, yeah.  Spam.  You've got to look at the stats. 
[01:47:30]  Spam.  Spam.  Spam.  Hey, we're going to take a look at the FU line, see what you guys are pissed about today.  Okay?  Right.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And?  Little Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Here's the latest batch of FUs.  You have six new voice messages.  First voice message.  This is a big FU to Caitlin, the bar whore who keeps calling my boyfriend.  Back off, bar whore.  Next message.  Hey, this is Ken from Augusta. 
[01:48:00]  I want to put out a big FU to my brother, Darren, who thinks it's funny by shooting me with his paintball gun to wake me up in the morning.  Payback is coming, dude.  FU.  Next message.  I want to give a big FU to Dr. Phil.  Leave Call of Duty 4 alone.  I like Xbox.  It did nothing to you.  Leave Call of Duty and Xbox alone.  Next message.  I'd like to leave a big, special, double-jointed FU to my ex-girlfriend who left me for a F***ing guy she later found out like other guys. 
[01:48:30]  F*** you.  Next message.  Hey, Opie and Anthony.  I would love to send a big mother F***ing FU to my girlfriend's mother, Kimberly.  Oh, she is a conniving, manipulative bitch.  So, FU Kim.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big FU to God for making me 6'5 with a 5-inch f***. 
[01:49:00]  F*** you, God.  End of new messages.  Call the Opie and Anthony FU line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Thank you and goodbye.  It's Opie and Anthony.  They're obsessed on the news.  Well, we were just going to point out, Jimmy, you left the studio.  You see that broad to the right on Channel 11? 
[01:49:30]  She's a psychiatrist.  Psychiatrist.  They brought in a psychiatrist to talk about the death of Heath Ledger.  They have to let the children in on this, and how do you do that?  Or how do you deal with grief?  There are grief counselors.  How do you deal with the nudity?  You want to get really weird with this?  Uh, haven't we?  I got a question, and I want an honest answer.  I want it answered immediately.  How many people were very relieved when they found out that Batman was completed? 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Be honest with yourself.  That's a little wrong.  Well, because he's going to play the Joker, right?  Yes, he is.  In Dark Knight.  Yeah.  It looks good, actually, too.  He looks horrifying.  He looks really good.  It looks like a good movie.  Although he looks a bit like Michael Keaton in, like, clown makeup.  Yeah.  But how many people were relieved because they know that he's going to be in the Dark Knight 
[01:50:30]  went, oh, God, did he have more scenes to film?  Oh, God.  And then you find out that he completed his scenes.  Yeah, kind of.  And he was done with the Dark Knight and moving on to other projects.  It wrecks a movie, though.  Why?  Because then you're preoccupied with the fact that you're watching the dead guy.  It happened with the crow.  You know, I remember when that movie came out and he was dead.  Yeah.  Bruce Lee's son there. 
[01:51:00]  What the hell was his name?  Brandon Lee.  Lee?  That would be funny to name him.  Thank you, Bruce.  Brandon Lee.  Bruce from Fall River.  He's an honest man.  I was totally relieved, Opie.  I'm telling you.  Totally relieved.  Reports are coming in.  The people are totally relieved.  And by the way, a lot of people call me a wuss because they finally saw Cloverfield.  And they said that they didn't get the nausea, the motion sickness thing.  That's fine.  You don't think when I say that I got a little nauseous seeing a stupid movie that I'm going 
[01:51:30]  to be perceived as a wimp?  I understand that.  It was a popcorn and Twizzlers.  I understand that.  I don't say this stuff hoping that you're going to look at me as a man's man.  I acknowledge some of the things that might make me look a little wimpy and wussy.  So it backfires when you'd call me out on it.  It's loud.  I already know that it's going to be perceived badly for me.  Maybe I had a sour stomach.  But anyway, real fast, in Oklahoma City, scary movies are supposed to leave patrons feeling 
[01:52:00]  a bit scared and jittery, but the newest horror flick is leaving Oklahoma City area movie  goers, long sentence there, with a different feeling, nausea.  So it is a real thing that is happening with that movie.  Yes, Jimmy?  Looks like I'm a little closer associated to this story than any of us believe.  Well, let's see how close Jimmy can connect himself to this story.  We should all try to see how close we can come to the story.  Well, no, I'm going to beat this one.  All right?  Mm-hmm. 
[01:52:30]  Mm-hmm.  The Dark Knight, a little film you may have heard of starring a said Heath Ledger to be  coming out July 18th.  Uh-huh.  Ooh.  Guess whose birthday is July 19th.  Wow.  Ooh.  That's downright creepy.  Yeah.  It's eerie.  Mitch Kumpstein?  Yes.  No, Mitch is May 20th.  Oh, okay.  By the way, remind me, tomorrow we've got to get Ronnie B, the great Ronnie B on our show. 
[01:53:00]  Yes, the legend.  His S, instead of saying the word, on Cloverfield is just hilarious.  Really?  Yeah.  Did he like it?  He did a little review?  It's hilarious.  I've got to hear that.  We've got to get him on to discuss the movie Cloverfield tomorrow.  Did he like it or not like it?  It's just hilarious.  Oh, okay.  I think he had problems with the movie.  Oh, a couple of problems.  I think he had a few problems.  A couple of problems. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, uh, Fez.  I think he had a few problems with the movie Cloverfield.  Ah, that Ronnie.  Unless, no, we don't have time now.  And he's probably sleeping.  We don't want to wake up the great Ronnie B.  Uh, oh, we teased this before the break.  Listen to this thing.  This is a hit in Jamaica, by the way.  A hit.  It's nice.  Stop it, Daddy.  Daddy, stop it now.  I'm going to tell on you now.  Ooh. 
[01:54:00]  Daddy, don't touch me there.  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared you're supposed to be my father?  Ooh.  Daddy, don't touch me there.  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared you're supposed to be my father?  Every day, I wonder why my daddy had to be the one to take away my innocence. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, sometimes I want to die.  It feels like no one cares for me.  And it's evident that something must be wrong with me.  I'm not as happy as I seem to be.  The long showers I take, don't wash away the memories.  Why do I have to face these tragedies?  So we go through struggles in life.  I'm aware, but to have my daddy touch with me, that's just not fair.  Jamaican poor girl.  I'm going to come from destroying my future. 
[01:55:00]  Believe me.  I don't know about you guys, but I'm getting the feeling that she might have been touched inappropriately.  A little, yeah, you wolf, maybe.  I don't know.  Way to read into it.  Oh, hey, Phil.  Maybe she means the location.  Right.  Don't touch me in Schenectady.  What are you really trying to say?  Takes long showers because she's lazy.  I'm going to tell on you someday, Dad.  We were supposed to be in Morrowboro, New Jersey, but you took me to Schenectady, New York.  I know what this song's about.  Oh, hey, wait.  Double on Tendry. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, funny.  Maybe you should tell somebody instead of singing a song about it.  Well, she said you're going to tell on them someday.  Not a good secret keeper if you're singing it.  Maybe you should have sang No.  I got a credit to Anthony Nakumia because he did remind me that we should get Ronnie B on the show to talk about Cloverfield.  You're right, Anthony Nakumia.  I should have gave you credit for that.  Can we hear more of that song?  Sure.  It's great. 
[01:56:00]  One day?  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, right?  The pink socks.  See, I can play along.  Oh, wow.  I'm with you.  Daddy, don't give me a pink sock because it slacked back like a slinky.  Daddy, don't give me a pink sock.  It make me feel like a silly goose backward elephant. 
[01:56:30]  By the way, Smokezilla is correct.  She is nude singing this song.  Yes, yes.  Because everything sounds better.  Is she pretty?  Throw nude in there.  I want to see what Daddy was thinking.  One day I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared?  You're supposed to be my father.  Ooh, daddy don't touch me then.  Call me crazy, but I don't think this is the type of song where you should be ooh and an ah.  No, no.  It's not an ooh, ah kind of a...  Usually when you hear an ooh and an ah in a song, you kind of get into it a little bit. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  You know, a good ooh and a good ah, it helps the song a lot.  Yeah, but this is trying to be sexy.  Not in this case, though.  He's supposed to be my father.  He is your father.  He's not a good one.  Yeah.  Oh, it depends on your point of view.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm enjoying that song.  Are you?  You want to put it on your iPad?  Yeah, that's one.  You're supposed to be my father.  Ooh, daddy don't touch me then.  All right.  We get it.  Did you ever do anything right? 
[01:57:30]  How about that?  Buy you a bike?  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right.  Enough of the negativity.  Why don't you sing about the time he brought you to the carnival?  Let's see the picture.  I want to see what daddy was thinking.  Which one is...  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, at this point, you got to understand the other point of view.  Oh, not just...  At least daddy didn't raise no fatty.  How old is she?  You rock.  Put the mic far away from your face and tell us. 
[01:58:00]  There was the mic running away.  She's got a MySpace page.  Is that what that is?  Really?  That's smart.  You're a victim, so what do you do?  Get a MySpace page so more of the pervs can find you.  Well, is she an adult?  All right.  Here we go.  Back to the song.  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared?  You're supposed to be my father.  To all your mothers out there, give a listen in here. 
[01:58:30]  Pay attention even if the man a pastor.  You have to make sure before you trust him with your daughter.  Plus him will even try to take your son as brother.  Watch him make me duck him with some dirty water.  You can't hide no more.  No, you have to meet your camera.  I don't know what she's saying.  You can't hide anymore.  You have to meet your karma.  Yeah.  Be careful if you're who you leave with your daughter.  Oh, look at you.  Yeah.  Speak patois.  Yeah, you do?  Shut up.  Give us a little, Jimmy, please. 
[01:59:00]  Me can't.  Why not?  Oh, wow.  Go back over.  I can understand a little bit of it.  I'll tell you what she said.  Me can't.  Yeah.  All right.  Me not no one.  It gets a little fast there.  Yeah, I know.  I get a piece of it.  But at the end, she's just saying, be careful.  Mothers, be careful who you leave your daughter with.  And then something about the son.  You have to make sure before you trust him with your daughter.  Plus him will even try to take your son as brother.  Watch him make me duck him with some dirty water.  You can't hide no more.  No, you have to meet your camera. 
[01:59:30]  You can't hide them.  Even a sight I want to turn a blind eye.  Then your judgment I go pile up out a mile high.  Get suicidal if you think it's a good save you.  Because me should.  Something save you because.  I think this is too wordy to become a hit.  Yeah.  A little wordy.  I get a little bit of that.  A little wordy.  Jamaican people do talk cool, though.  Do they?  Oh, it's fantastic.  I don't know if you think it's a good save you.  Because me sure say you're not going to get to see the save you.  Me just can't find a name for you to be here for you. 
[02:00:00]  It's a lucky thing we got a nosy neighbor.  Lucky thing we got a nosy neighbor.  Kyle S. is on to something.  Is this the Edmund Fitzgerald of kid touching?  Just keeps going and going.  And he touched me as he got to the Gitchaguni.  The Gitchaguni.  I did a little rewrite for you, Kyle.  Very good, though.  All right.  Back to the kid touching song.  Don't touch me there.  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear. 
[02:00:30]  Can't you see I'm scared?  You're supposed to be my father.  I don't know.  I think if you were touched inappropriately, you would make it like a quick two-minute pop song  like the Beatles used to do in the day.  Not an epic.  Like a love, love, me, don't.  Yeah.  Please don't attack me with that brown submarine.  Oh, help. 
[02:01:00]  I need some.  Yeah.  The long and stinky road.  Oh, Lucy in the shower with diamonds.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, wait.  I'm sure they'll come pouring in any second now.  While my backside gently leaks. 
[02:01:30]  By the way, for the haters out there that wonder.  You see, I just threw a perfect, a perfect bounce pass to these guys.  And they dunked it.  So stop.  Oh.  Stop wondering.  I am John Stockton.  Thank you.  Thank you, fan.  Any more Beatles songs?  Yeah.  Yeah, they're coming.  A Hard Dad's Night. 
[02:02:00]  Steven S. from Mayshore.  Yeah.  Love me, don't.  Yes.  All right.  Back to the song.  As we think.  Daddy, don't touch me there.  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared?  You're supposed to be my father.  I don't know.  Okay.  Eleanor Frigme. 
[02:02:30]  No.  Boo.  Boo.  Okay.  Bang, bang.  Daddy's chocolate hammer came down.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You didn't avoid that pileup, did you?  Oh, my God.  I like the bell.  That's both inappropriate.  Oh, dear Lord.  Oh, dear Lord.  Indeed.  I want to hold your clam. 
[02:03:00]  Evil.  Evil hippie.  Farming bill.  Did we do While My Daughter Gently Weeps?  We kind of did that one.  That's funny, too.  When you feel like giving up, don't shake it off and live it up. 
[02:03:30]  He rapes me, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wilmington, wow.  Oh, my goodness.  This is not right.  Can't you see I'm scared?  You're supposed to be my father.  When you feel like giving up, don't shake it off and live it up.  The most I will deliver you.  Can't jump the rope if you're not dry.  So wipe that tears there from you. 
[02:04:00]  I get the wings of confidence to make you fly.  Tribulations are just to make you stronger.  Love yourself and it will help your feet get over.  Any place where a talic or youth will never prosper.  Okay.  I'm passing on the message from the master.  Every day I wonder why my daddy has to be the one to take my mind.  Just get ready on the button.  What?  What?  Back in the U-A-S-S. 
[02:04:30]  Wow, that's kind of...  Well, it's very funny.  It's a bit wordy.  Oh, you got the psychiatrist.  All right, cool.  Oh, hold on.  We got to finish the song.  Every day I wonder why my daddy had to be the one to take away my innocence.  Oh, sometimes I want to die.  It feels like no one cares for me.  And it's every day that something must be wrong with me. 
[02:05:00]  I'm not as happy as I seem to be.  The long showers I take don't wash away the memories.  Why do I have to face these tragedies?  We go through struggles in life.  You're kidding me?  If it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have the future you got.  Exactly.  Singing star.  My dad took me to the carnival wasn't a big hit for you, was it?  Yeah, right.  Daddy, can I please have cotton candy? 
[02:05:30]  It didn't really move up the charts now, did it?  Harry Chapin covered the nice father angle, and you got the other angle.  Lucky you.  Daddy, don't put that in there.  It's only going to help me with my singing career.  Don't kid it, man.  You got to think about a follow-up hit here.  Exactly.  Get that body in shape.  Daddy, don't touch me there. 
[02:06:00]  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared you're supposed to be my father?  Ooh, daddy, don't touch me there.  I'm going to tell on you one day, I swear.  Can't you see I'm scared you're supposed to be my father?  Oh, God.  Can't you be the one to take away my image?  Oh, come down, come down, come down. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, who's that going to hold?  There you go.  So, that's just setting the world on fire.  No, don't touch me there.  By the way, a big thank you to Laszlo.  Laszlo?  Yeah, he gave us that.  Wow.  Found by Laszlo in Jamaica.  Queen Ifrica.  Yeah, thank you to Laszlo on that.  She's very good.  The great Laszlo.  Laszlo can find some tidbits.  She's popular in Jamaica, but not here?  No.  I would guess.  Well, let's all go to get Queen Ifrica.  She's killer.  She's very popular in Jamaica, apparently. 
[02:07:00]  Guys, we got to squeeze this in.  Heath Ledger.  So, now they're up to getting a psychiatrist on the local news to talk about this.  Can I have to just jump in real quick?  The father actually did put out a follow-up song.  It's called, me told you not to wear that dress, or we're going to make your back a mess.  Me told your mother not to get fat.  Here's the psychiatrist, Dr. Jody Gold. 
[02:07:30]  Talks about Heath.  How easy is it to overdose on sleeping pills?  And we've been talking about Andy and...  How easy it...  How?  What?  Well, there's the whole mouth, the swallowing, the following it up with fluid.  Right.  I would guess it's pretty hard.  I guess you would have to probably swallow more than five.  Yeah, quite a few of them.  How easy is it to overdose on sleeping pills?  And we've been talking about Ambien, because that was a prescription drug that was found by police by his bedside. 
[02:08:00]  Well, this is the thing.  Ambien used safely and as prescribed is very safe.  It's actually not that easy to overdose on one medication.  Ambien, like Ambien, unless you took an excessive amount.  Thanks for that, because I didn't know.  How easy is it to overdose?  Well, only if you take an excessive amount.  Yeah, that's called overdosing.  You mean the recommended dosers doesn't just kill you immediately?  Oh, I can't get enough of this stuff.  I love, like, picking apart this crap.  It's just my favorite thing to do in the world now. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, we got T.J. Miller coming in to promote his Letterman appearance.  Of course, one of the stars of Cloverfield.  We got J.J. Abrams, the producer of Cloverfield, calling in tomorrow.  And the great Ronnie B. to discuss Cloverfield all tomorrow.  Great.  Also, we live in a time where sleeping pills, and just pills in general, are just so accessible for everybody.  There's a pill to solve everybody's sort of myriad of situations.  Is there?  So, how does a parent kind of, like, talk to a kid about this?  A pill for that?  Why do they always have to go to the, how does a parent talk to their child about this scenario? 
[02:09:00]  Um, you don't.  I know.  If you want to know how a parent should talk to a kid, why don't they point you to Queen Ifrica's homepage?  Kind of, like, talk to a kid about this.  So, what we have to do is, first of all, help, what this brings to light is, is that these medications are safe when they're taken as prescribed.  They should never be taken not as prescribed.  So, that's the first message to send to kids and to adults. 
[02:09:30]  The second message is to realize that we can't solve everything.  Wait, is it important to tell kids to take medicine as prescribed?  Is that the bombshell she releases?  Yes.  Wouldn't that be the responsibility of the parent?  How did they get the skinny on this?  It's like you're handing, like, pills, a bottle of pills to your four-year-old.  They go, you know, make sure you read the instructions.  Yeah.  Why is there so much stress on how to talk to children?  Because parents are just, are they that dumb and bad that they don't know how to talk to their own kids? 
[02:10:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  I say, unless, of course, you're from Jamaica.  Daddy, don't touch me there.  It's not going to help me deal with the death of Heath Ledger.  John in Boston.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I got a Beatles song for you.  Okay.  When I was only four instead of when I'm 64.  All right.  Official.  End of the bit.  Well, he had something there, but he didn't pause and then had to explain where when I was only four came from. 
[02:10:30]  See, because it's the song when I'm 64 and I took out the 60 part.  Most people would have gotten it if you just said when I was only four.  What I did then was, ah.  I finally, ah, more psychobabble from Dr. Jody Gold.  To kids and to adults.  The second message is to realize is that we can't solve everything with medication.  There is a role for that, but there's also a role for intervention.  There's also a role for therapy.  There's also a role for family support.  A role for your sandwich.  Ah!  Can we get her on the phone? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, let's get her on the phone.  Let's get Dr. Judy Gold on.  Or Jody Gold, what's her name?  Jody, yeah.  Let's get Dr. Judy Gold.  Yes, Judy's a friend of mine.  Let's get Jody.  All right.  And finally, this.  And I think the other big thing that's been brought up with him is the sleep issue.  And I think sleep's a big deal.  I think we write it out a lot.  I think we say, oh, this is part of life, not being able to sleep.  Sleep's a big deal.  But the truth is that if you're having difficulty sleeping for more than a couple of days and it's impairing your life,  it might be a symptom of something bigger.  You need to get help.  You need to get help.  And on that, we thank you for joining us and shedding some light.  Shedding some light.  Shedding some light.  There was none light shed. 
[02:11:30]  None.  A meteor hitting the earth would shed more light and the dust went into the clouds.  And they get it because the dust is in there.  And they solved it.  Trapped miners.  Trapped miners.  Have more light.  More light, see, because it's a mine and it's dark down there.  And they solved everyone's sleeping problem because they fell asleep watching that.  Yes.  All right, listen. 
[02:12:00]  We didn't do anything today.  Let's be honest with each other.  What?  We covered the Heath Ledger thing.  We talked about little hatchet-faced children.  We talked about the pompous Ringo on the Asinine Regis show.  Oh, my God.  What else did we talk about?  MySpace.com, Jim Norton.  Myriad of things.  We talked about a Jamaican father and his love for his daughter.  We talked about... 
[02:12:30]  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm real excited.  Real excited.  Is that me too?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  I don't eat.  I eat my  canny lope.  But then I do have my smoothie.  All right.  Here we are.  It's like I have a mouthful.  Goodness.  Satellite radio.  So we leave K-Rock a mere 15 minutes ago and coming off the elevators as we were going on was a locksmith. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, that's all I'm saying, a locksmith.  Where?  As we were going on to the elevators.  Yeah, they're probably changing some things.  Yeah, they're probably changing some things.  Some locks.  Well, Tom's gone.  Yeah, but... 
[02:17:30]  They don't want him privy to any proprietary information at this point.  We'll have to wait and see.  We'll have to wait and see.  Don't they change the locks after you're fired?  Or after you leave the building?  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  And we're also working on something.  Look right there.  It's just waiting.  Look right there.  It really is.  It's just waiting for a good fucking...  There's barely anyone there.  It really is. 
[02:18:00]  It's set up perfectly for us.  You know that.  We all know that.  Yes.  It's right there.  All right.  We got some exclusive XM material for you people.  That's right, we do.  That's the stuff with shits and fucks in it.  That's right.  Because, like, we tell all our guests that are over at the FM portion, when they come  here, we go, this is the show with the curses.  Yeah.  That you can curse on. 
[02:18:30]  We really make it sound like it's something special.  A hell of a way to, yeah, promote satellite radio.  Yeah.  Come on over to the other joint.  We can curse and shit.  Yeah.  We even say it like that.  Curse and shit.  And shit.  Hmm.  Oh.  So how was the gambling?  That's it.  Well, I usually play alone at a reserve table.  Sometimes I'll play with other people.  But there was this one guy.  I'm sitting there with another guy.  We're having a great time. 
[02:19:00]  And then this guy comes down with this cowboy hat, sits down, and he's contemplating, with  the dealers showing a picture card, he's contemplating not hitting a 13.  Are you shitting me?  Every other bet now, I'm just betting the minimum.  I'm like, I can't do anything because I'm afraid to make a big bet that this guy is going  to screw me.  And if this jackass screws things up, you want to kill him.  I swear I will kill you.  Because the odds are he's going to screw up. 
[02:19:30]  And he was screwing up.  Son of a...  God damn it!  I want to play against the dealer.  Not against the idiot next to me.  You fucking...  You fucking moron!  You're an idiot!  You're an idiot!  Die!  Die!  Die!  Are you feeling okay?  I'm fine!  I was in a great mood!  Believe me.  I don't need an intervention here.  That was nice. 
[02:20:00]  That paints me out to be a little bit of a lunatic.  Yeah, a little bit.  Just my, um...  My old gambling story.  Why can't this be...  A little gambling.  Okay.  Hey, um...  Stacey's going to get the talk going here.  Stacey in Levittown.  Your story, please.  Okay.  Well, anyway, I was trying to be sexy for my man, and I put whipped cream on my nipples. 
[02:20:30]  Where did this come from?  And I stood in front of the fan, and I just threw into his face.  And you...  Oh.  This is, uh...  This could start something.  And you know me and Anthony, because I think my friend fucked you.  Opie.  Opie.  Opie.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I seriously think my friend fucked you.  Why?  Why?  There's more than one Stacey around. 
[02:21:00]  What?  What are you talking about?  Opie.  Am I talking to Opie?  Opie, Anthony, Jimmy...  It's Opie, Anthony, Jimmy Norton.  Okay, what...  Listen.  Uh-huh.  Too much information at once.  Am I talking to Opie?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay, what color is your hair?  I need to know.  Uh, blue.  You dyed it yesterday?  Yeah.  Did you?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:21:30]  It was blonde the day before?  You're attempting to say you've...  I know.  I know.  Are you with, um...  What's her name?  Johanna.  Wow!  This is great.  She is...  Nice ambient buzz.  Oh, I know you.  Hey, Stacey.  Hey, right.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I didn't fuck anybody the day before.  Stacey, are you saying you know someone or are the person that you're alleging... 
[02:22:00]  No, I don't.  You know what?  Been around, goes around, comes around, whatever.  What time in the morning is it?  I don't know.  Because, uh...  It's me.  You are in Levittown.  I just hope it's someone that basically said they were me and gave you a good fucking...  Probably said it was you and gave a lousy one.  Hopefully, hopefully, in a little bit, I will get one.  From who?  Oh, from the guy right here whose head is on the table. 
[02:22:30]  What?  How did your friend fuck up me?  By saying, call the show?  Yeah.  Excuse me?  Yeah, I didn't think you would get that, but...  Are you a horse lover?  One place or show?  Is that what you said?  I don't...  I'm sorry.  Are you a little intoxicated this morning?  Have you been drinking?  No. 
[02:23:00]  I have not.  You sound like you're under the...  Like, ever.  You sound like you're under the influence of something.  Well, I think you know me, so you should know.  Of course we all do.  Were you hanging out with Heath Ledger?  Give me your MySpace.  Give me your MySpace account.  No, I'm still alive.  But do you know what happened to him?  I mean, it's Mary Cade and Ashley and whatever the fuck.  I really need to know what happened.  Oh, well, we know what happened, but you won't listen. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  Because I love Brokeback Mountain, you know?  Mountain?  Yeah.  Did you?  Mountain?  That's an awesome movie.  Women like you are the reason that Brokeback Mountain happens.  Oh, my God.  You can't listen to the babble anymore, just spit in your hand and stick it in a cowboy's  dumper.  Am I sending you to homosexuality?  Is that what you're saying?  What?  We're saying you...  Am I sending you to homosexuality?  It's okay.  I am. 
[02:24:00]  But once again, there's no fucking pen.  Oh.  Give me a...  I just...  I don't fucking get...  What?  Sorry.  What don't you get, Jimmy?  Am I really on the radio?  Yeah, you are.  Yeah, unfortunately, is what everybody's saying.  What is your MySpace?  We want to see what you look like.  I...  Well, I can tell you what I look like.  Wait, fuck it.  Okay.  Well, of course.  I don't have a camera phone.  You don't have a camera phone.  No, I don't.  But you can describe yourself. 
[02:24:30]  Go ahead.  I can.  I'm 5'4".  Hmm?  I am 130 pounds.  Oof.  Yuck.  My breasts...  Oh, yuck!  You better have 85 Ds.  Oh, fuck you!  Right on, baby.  Is this Opie or Anthony?  This is Opie.  Okay, Opie.  Thank you.  Oh, I know you.  I met you before.  No, you didn't.  I'm sure you didn't.  Now, listen.  I did, too.  People are saying this is Darian O'Toole.  She just forgot her name.  Oh, really?  It does say. 
[02:25:00]  First of all, if you're saying you're 5'4", 130, that means you're at least 140, hence  the yuck.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't lie, sweetie.  I have very large breasts.  Yeah, how large?  Sorry.  They probably...  My breasts probably are 20 pounds.  Your breasts are 20 pounds.  See, most women measure them differently.  Yeah.  Not in pounds.  No, I, you know, my fucking cousin dared me to put them on the scale and whatever. 
[02:25:30]  Your cousin made you put your...  It is what it is.  Yeah.  As he put his dick up your ass?  Yeah.  No, she's the team.  Jamaican song about her.  Yeah, right.  Now, listen.  You're really bothering everybody, so why don't you masturbate or something and get off the  phone?  You're a little annoying.  Yeah.  Like you're...  Yeah.  Do you want to masturbate for us?  And if I did, you would know? 
[02:26:00]  Know what?  That I was masturbating.  Oh, that she was doing it.  Yeah, we would.  You would know?  Yeah.  Why?  Because I would moan or something?  Yeah.  You think so?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Could you turn me on?  No.  I'll talk dirty to you.  I don't think you could either.  No, you're wrong, sweetie.  I'll talk dirty to you well. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Talk dirty to me.  All right.  Here's Opie.  He's going to talk dirty to you.  Okay.  All right.  I'm not kidding, though.  You've got to stop giggling.  I mean, you want to talk to you.  You've got to relax.  Okay.  Go, go, go.  All right.  That's not a sexy way to start.  What do you have on, first of all, so I have what I'm working with?  Well, I don't have anything on.  Are you naked?  Of course I am.  All right.  I want you to picture yourself.  You're lying back, and I'm there with you, and I start-  Okay.  Well, that's a turnoff right there. 
[02:27:00]  That I'm there with you?  Yeah.  Well, miss, I'm trying to talk dirty to you.  No, listen.  You're an awkward, unsexy woman.  Do you know that?  You're an uncomfortable drunk who has no idea how to communicate in a sexy fashion.  A comment?  Now, I'm trying to talk to you.  You just said, can I turn you on, and I'm starting, and you're getting uncomfortable  with it because you're a sloppy babbler.  You're being rude. 
[02:27:30]  I'm not being rude.  I said I was with you when you're naked.  How is that rude?  Okay.  Let's pretend.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Let's pretend that you're undressing me.  Yeah.  Let's pretend that you're taking my panties off.  That's right.  Well, that's Levittown, Jesus.  That's right.  Hold on.  Now I take your panties off, and then I take my underpants off.  And you're licking my inner thighs.  That's right. 
[02:28:00]  And I start to lick all the way away from your crotch to tease you, and I start licking  down towards your knee, and I take my tongue, and I trail it over your calf.  I have to tell you right now, I'm not into that anal thing.  No, me neither.  Jesus, he was going away.  I know, miss.  I was going down.  He was heading toward your knees, and you're already caught.  You're waving him off like a carrier deck.  You're waving him off of the ass.  Hold on.  I was waving.  I was going towards your feet.  Like, I'm naked.  You're on your back.  Oh, you're one of those feet guys? 
[02:28:30]  Not at all, miss.  If you let me finish, instead of interrupting, she's going to like anything.  I don't want my feet licked.  I'm not licking your feet.  Shut your mouth and open up your ass.  What I like to do, miss, is what I want to do is I want to hold your legs open and tease  your thighs, and then I'm going to kind of put my butt right against...  Oh, that sounds kind of good.  Exactly.  I'm going to go right against your vagina with my butt.  Let me imagine.  Hold on, miss.  I'm going to rub my butt right in your vagina, and I'm going to start to turtle into it. 
[02:29:00]  A turtle?  What the fuck is a turtle?  Let me finish.  I'm going to hang a half a log out.  You what?  We just listen.  I'm going to hang a half a log out, and I'm going to like hold it with my butt cheeks.  Listen.  Is the log the poop?  Yes.  Just hold on and listen.  It gets real sexy.  And then I'm going to fuck you with my poop for a few seconds, so your cunt smells like 
[02:29:30]  shit.  And then I'm going to flip you over on your face and kidney punch you, so you start throwing  up.  And then I'm going to...  You're not into anal, but I'm just going to tease your asshole with my cock head, and  I'm going to say like...  I'm going to say, dip for shit, no.  Dip for shit, no.  Listen.  Hold on.  I'm not finished, cookie.  He's not finished.  And then I'm going to sink my teeth into your back fat. 
[02:30:00]  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second, drunken slob.  I'm going to sink my teeth into your back fat, and then bury my dick into your backside.  And I'm going to grunt as I put it in like this.  As I'm biting your back fat.  And then I'm going to pull out and run backwards quickly and give you a pink sock that I'm going  to let snap back, and it's going to hurt like the dickens. 
[02:30:30]  Hold on, I'm going to look like an aardvark's nose, but smell like shit and alcohol.  How much blood do you have in your stool, by the way?  Fucking Mickey Rourke from Barfly.  I don't like anal.  A drink for my friends.  Hey, Nicolas Cage from Leaving Las Vegas.  What time did you start fucking doing power shots this morning? 
[02:31:00]  Fucking drunken whore.  It's nine o'clock a.m.  We'd almost give you the bed for the dot if it was noon, you fucking drunk.  Unsexy monster.  My favorite part of Jimmy's story is how he's going to run backwards to pull out the pink  sock.  I'm going to run backwards, and then what I'm going to do is pinch my dick shaft so all  the blood stops going to the head, and then the head will wilt, and the pink sock will  snap back on your anus.  That would be a really good fucking thing, because you can never make me fucking cum.  Of course I can make you cum. 
[02:31:30]  I'll just show you a bottle of booze, and I'll watch your panties fill up with goop.  I'll show you a bottle of booze.  You want a belt of booze, honey?  Next thing you know, you're making rice pudding in your panties.  That's right.  You fucking...  I'll fucking...  I'll fuck you with a tequila worm.  I'm sure that will make you cum.  Name your poison.  I'm going to get that cancer.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Oh, two samples of gas.  See?  Will you get off our phone?  Yeah.  Did she hang up?  I don't know. 
[02:32:00]  Okay, bye.  You're a drunken pig, and you're not sexy.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver that isn't you.  I hope you're killed by a drunk driver when you're sober.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  All right.  Oh, what a slump.  There she goes.  That was...  I want to talk to the psychologist, though, because...  Oh, we got her?  Yeah.  I mean, there's so much going on with this Heath Ledger thing.  It's gotten kind of...  It's upsetting to a whole bunch of people.  Hi.  Jody?  Yes.  Dr. Jody Gold, this is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:32:30]  Hi.  I'm sure you're getting a lot of interview requests today on this Heath Ledger thing.  Yeah, we are, unfortunately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's tragic news when we all heard it late last night and this morning.  Um, how would you, uh, have the parents deal with the children during this, uh, tough time,  really?  That's really the hardest question.  Yeah.  Because this is not a guy...  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  This is not a guy that we expected this from.  He wasn't on the top five of people this would happen to.  Right.  So I think that that's the problem.  Yeah.  The other issue is that this guy, his persona, whether it was true or not, was at the guy  next door.  Yeah.  Like, he was the guy that kept himself.  Yeah.  And I think that kids and families need to understand that just because you're not Lindsay  and Brittany and you're not, you know, engaging in self-assisted behavior all the time,  doesn't mean that you're not hurting.  Right.  Well, let me ask you, not to interrupt, but are they saying now that it was a... 
[02:33:30]  The idea that it was a suicide was at first poo-pooed by the family, and then other people  are speculating that it may be, um, your feelings?  Sounded despondent.  Yeah.  Was it a purposeful thing or was it just an accidental overdose?  I mean, please.  Well, this is the thing.  It's too early to know.  I mean, it's all speculative.  Right.  More investigation.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, I'm keeping an open mind.  More to come later today, probably, I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I'm hoping that it wasn't suicide.  Right.  What we do know is that he was hurting. 
[02:34:00]  I mean, that's something that was public.  Yes.  What would indicate that probably?  What would you think?  Because I've heard just the opposite, but I could be wrong.  Would it be the nudeness that, uh, is an indication or?  I'm sorry, the what?  The nudity.  He was found nude.  Yeah, the nudity.  Is that an indication of depression, like, with pills mixed in?  No.  No, no, no.  Absolutely not.  I think he could sleep in the nude and not be depressed.  Well, what would the nude thing implicate in this situation with Heath Ledger's passing?  Um, I think that clearly he wasn't, what we know is that he wasn't in his right, and he 
[02:34:30]  wasn't thinking clearly when this happened.  We know he was struggling a little bit with insomnia.  I think that's the kind of stuff we know.  Is it easier to sleep, uh, in the nude if you have insomnia?  Yeah, honestly, I don't know if there's any medical studies on that one.  Dr. Gold, this is a serious, um, subject.  I, we, we really don't want any laughter.  Thank you.  I agree.  This is very serious.  Thank you.  Yes, yes.  Um, I, I don't know.  Our listeners get, um, a little, they've been calling in, uh, just in sorrow and tears, 
[02:35:00]  some of them, uh, to the show, and I don't think the laughter's appropriate.  Uh, now the nudity, is that part of this overdosing?  Uh, a lot of people that have overdosed, John Belushi, um, Marilyn Monroe, have been found  in the nude.  Why, why is this nudity such an issue with, uh, this type of thing?  I don't think it is.  I actually think that it's the kind of thing that people like to report on, and I actually  think that it does take away from the gravity of the situation. 
[02:35:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's what we've been saying all morning.  And I really think they've been focusing on the fact that he was naked.  No need to bring that up is what I'm saying.  I don't think we should be talking about it.  Right.  I'm saying no need to bring it up.  Of course.  Doc.  I don't think we need to bring it up.  Doc.  I agree 100%.  Will, uh, will shockwaves be felt through, uh, the community?  I'm sorry, what did you say?  Will shockwaves be felt through the community?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think that people are feeling very sad. 
[02:36:00]  Now, you said earlier that, uh, he wasn't in the top five of people this would happen to.  Uh, is there an actual top five list?  Hmm.  Good question.  I guess Britney Spears would be in the top five.  Yeah, I think that the celebrities that have self-injurious behavior, self-destructive  behavior that we read about all the time, are the people that we would expect, unfortunately.  Right, right.  What would your, who would be in your top five?  Well, I think that, uh, I, I mean, I don't want to, I don't want to conjecture on who  might, I'm hoping that none of these people would answer it. 
[02:36:30]  Exactly.  Right.  You have a list of who I think might.  I think that the, go ahead.  Just, yeah, go ahead, uh, Dr. Jody Goldberg.  I think that the general public is, is, expects more that these, these people that are in  the news all the time.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So I think this is really scary.  Thank you, Alan Alda.  He felt like, I think Heath Ledger felt like your next door neighbor, your son, your boyfriend.  He did.  He really did.  From the people I've spoken to, uh, there's a great attachment, especially in this, uh, 
[02:37:00]  uh, the Big Apple, uh, here in New York City for this, uh, young man.  And, uh, it's just tragic.  And, and Dr. Jody Goldberg, uh, Anthony, who was just speaking, uh, he's been sharing his,  his, uh, his connection with, uh, Heath Ledger all morning long.  Yes.  Actually, I did, um, have, uh,  that you told a couple times this morning.  I had a girlfriend, uh, an ex-girlfriend actually that, um, knew, uh, uh, gentleman  that dated the woman, Michelle, Michelle, that, uh, is the mother of, uh, his, uh, baby. 
[02:37:30]  So I, I feel especially close to the situation, uh, in that way that I even had any, any connection  to it.  Um, and she'd walk by the apartment all the time and she said it was always like kind  of neat and stuff on the outside.  And it's just so unexpected.  Clean people.  Um, I think that's what makes it so tragic.  So tragic, yeah.  So, so, so, so nude and so tragic.  And I think that's why we're feeling shockwaves because he was the guy next door and we're  all afraid this is going to happen.  I think that for kids, though, they need to know that you can be suffering and you can 
[02:38:00]  be keeping to yourself and you can be isolated and anxious and you still need help.  Despite having millions.  And we have Jim C, the, um, medical examiner here, uh, just speculating on, uh, how can  you tell the difference between, uh, a suicide and an unintentional, uh, overdose?  Because a suicide is, is, is done by accident.  And, uh, well, it wouldn't have been, uh, Jim C, it would have been, uh, it was murder. 
[02:38:30]  Well, I, I doubt that.  We were sold in the pills.  It was murder.  Well, now that is another problem.  Doctors that prescribe a lot of pills for people and.  It's timeout to murder.  Well, Jim C, I don't, I don't see that, but, uh.  Do you not agree, doctor?  Do you agree that these doctors are maybe prescribing too many pills for people these days?  I think that the pills, when taken as prescribed, are very safe.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Uh, uh, doctor.  Thank you, Jim C. 
[02:39:00]  Can we have you for a couple more minutes?  Because, uh, we've been discussing this all morning and we got a lot of our, our listeners  with, um, with, uh, serious questions about this issue.  Yeah.  Sure.  If I can be of help, I'm happy to stay.  Are you trying to tell me that you think that these doctors shouldn't be charged with murder?  No, Jim C.  Uh, a lot of times, uh, the people, for some reason, are given these drugs when, um, there  may not be a reason for so many of these, uh, drugs, uh, to be prescribed. 
[02:39:30]  Well, I think that if you're going to a good, uh, mental health professional, a good physician.  Yes.  Yes.  Evaluated appropriately.  There is a place and a time for sleep aids and for antidepressants.  Yeah.  I think the problem is when they're mixed or they're used inappropriately.  And I want to be really clear about that.  Yeah.  There's millions of people on these medications and they're safe and they're very effective  when used appropriately.  Now, have you heard any more about this, uh, issue of pneumonia perhaps, uh, contributing? 
[02:40:00]  I don't know much about the issue of pneumonia.  What I do know is that most healthy 28 year old men who get pneumonia, it can be treated  quite easily with either, uh, antibiotics by mouth or IV.  Right.  And people that were to unfortunately die of pneumonia usually don't die overnight.  It's sort of more prolonged.  They usually end up in the hospital.  Right.  He may have been what's called immunocompromised, a little bit more vulnerable because he was  having difficulty breathing.  But I think that that, we may get some more information about that when the autopsy comes out. 
[02:40:30]  Uh, doctor, I got, I got a little one at home.  Um, little Gregorio.  And, uh, how do I, how adorable?  Well, here's a button.  How is he?  Thank you.  He's, he's all right.  He's great.  He seems to be a little, uh, a little distant, uh, this morning.  Hmm.  Um, how old is he?  He's, uh, four and a half.  But he liked, uh, a Brokeback Mountain, but not for the story.  It was the, you know, the music and the, the colors and, you know, the Western thing.  He wants to be a cowboy.  Well, now I got to explain to the doctor. 
[02:41:00]  I, I, I, I feel as a parent that you should expose your children to, to all this stuff and explain  what they're saying.  It's healthy.  Instead of like, you know, turning off the computer and the video games and the, and  the R-rated movies, we'd like to kind of watch some of these things together.  And, uh, and then I discuss, you know, uh, what he, he just saw.  Um, it's, it's a little complicated when you're talking about death when it's young, because  kids that are under five or six years of age, and sometimes even older, um, have difficulty 
[02:41:30]  understanding the meaning of death.  Yeah, except like, you know, Jaminé or something, but right, yeah.  They have things, what we call magical thinking, meaning they may think that, you know, you  go away and then you come back.  Right.  You know, they may not quite understand the finality of death.  Are you, are you suggesting that we raise super kids?  I'm sorry.  Am I suggesting what?  That we raise super kids.  It's, uh, we've had a few doctors on over the years and they, they, they discuss like  raising super kids. 
[02:42:00]  Linger longer.  It's a way to get kids, uh, uh, uh, prepared for the future by almost making them super  kids while they're younger, by exposing them to certain things and very adult things, uh,  telling them things, being honest.  It's a well-known Oxford, uh, study that came out, uh, late last year.  Uh, what I think, and I, I don't know much about the super kids, so I don't want to speak  directly to that.  What I think is important with young kids is talking to them in an appropriate, age-appropriate 
[02:42:30]  level.  Right.  Um, they're not adults.  So talking to them like adults, we're not really sure how they're going to process information.  Okay.  So you have to talk to a four and five-year-old understanding what developmental level they're  at.  Can you, uh, take a couple phone calls?  Uh, sure.  Okay, we got, um, let's see, we got Steve from, uh, uh, uh, Steve, where are you calling  from?  Uh, Yellowstone.  Steve from Yellowstone?  Hello?  Yes, Steve.  Is the doctor there, doctor? 
[02:43:00]  Yes.  Doctor, is this Dr. Gold?  Yes.  Oh, I, I saw you on the CW 11 too.  I'm, I'm having a hard time because for some reason I, I was a big fan of, of, uh, Heath  Lager.  Yes.  Yes, many of us were, yeah.  And it's very difficult to deal with such an untimely death.  I'm not too sure what to do or what to tell my young boy.  Yeah, it's a difficult discussion.  I am not too sure how to handle this.  Yeah, no, I completely understand.  I know you do.  That's why I'm asking. 
[02:43:30]  What should I do?  Well, I, I think is it something you do?  What's that?  How old is your son?  He's 11.  He'll be 14.  He's 11.  Yes.  Okay.  Um, and as you're aware of what's happened, do you see it on the news?  Yes, I woke him.  You woke him to tell.  Well, I think that, I think he was, uh.  He was sleeping and I woke him up because it was a tragedy and I don't know how to handle  it.  So I woke him up angrily.  Well, I think that what's important for young kids is how the parents. 
[02:44:00]  But he's not very young, I don't mean to interrupt you, he's 11, he'll be 12 when it's his birthday.  Right.  July 19th, the day after the Joker movie is released, which I think is kind of ironic that  the Heath Legger died and the movie's coming out the 18th, his birthday.  Yeah, no, I can understand that.  I think what's important though is that you model the behavior you want.  If you're angry and you're really, really upset.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry?  Yes, caller, yes.  Did we lose the caller? 
[02:44:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't feel angry.  Yes, could you please get to the point with Dr. Gold?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Her time is valuable today.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  A lot of interviews to do.  I just wanted to know if you could please explain.  I'm not too sure what to tell my son because he died at Ambien.  First of all, we're still speculating on how he died.  We don't know that yet.  I think it's important not to jump to conclusions.  Okay.  However, I think that you have to sit down with your son and have a conversation. 
[02:45:00]  Hello?  Are you still there?  I am.  I'm really, I know, this is a really hard thing for a lot of us to deal with, especially  somebody that, you know, we don't know.  Come on!  This boring bitch makes Ambien look like methamphetamines.  No.  Well, we don't know what he died of.  Come on!  Accidental chef!  I'm Harry.  Well, we don't actually know what he died of. 
[02:45:30]  Come on!  Come on!  John Wayne is laughing at this shit dick!  Well, I think what's important, though, is that you not talk to your son about this until  you feel like...  Come on!  Daddy, don't touch me there!  It's the only way to handle this!  Okay.  Are you there?  Come on!  Move alone!  Dr. Gould makes my dick shrink! 
[02:46:00]  Okay.  I think that probably we should...  Move alone!  I'm so sorry that you're feeling this back.  Thank you.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, obviously...  Maybe we should consider moving on to a different caller.  Yeah, Jody, that was obviously...  Hello?  Can we get rid of the caller, please?  No, I'm sorry, Steve.  You know... 
[02:46:30]  I don't know what to do.  We're trying to take this very seriously.  You know...  This isn't a joke.  No, this is absolutely no joke.  If you're taking it tough and think this is going to help, you're sadly mistaken, Steve.  I'm sorry, Jody.  Yes.  We got rid of the caller.  Yeah.  Okay, thank you.  Every once in a while, you know, you get one of those numbskulls.  Sorry.  And I think it's really unfortunate because I do think that a lot of people are really  seriously suffering.  That are grieving and do have issues as parents and how to deal with it with their children. 
[02:47:00]  And I think people like you and people in the business, in the psychiatric field,  can help.  Yes.  I think they can.  And I think that what we can learn from this last caller is that parents do model behavior  for kids.  So if the parents are hysterical or inappropriate in some way, the kids are going to pick up  on that.  Right.  If you're going to have a conversation with your children, you need to be in a place.  Right.  Psychologically.  You can sit down with them, ask them what they understand, speak to them at a developmentally 
[02:47:30]  appropriate level, and address their concerns.  Not the parents' concerns, but the children's concerns.  Well, you are a trooper.  Yeah.  Let's get this back on track.  We got Uncle Paul calling in.  If you don't know who he is, he's a local celebrity in Oklahoma.  He calls our show a lot.  And he's a kid's show host out there in Oklahoma.  Oh.  Wonderful.  Uncle Paul, you're talking to Dr. Jody Gold. 
[02:48:00]  I got a bad connection.  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  I do a children's show out here in Oklahoma.  That's wonderful.  I'm here.  It's just very difficult, it seems, when a celebrity dies.  Why do you think kids have more trouble with a celebrity death than with the average death?  Because we've all lost people in our lives.  But when it's a famous person, we have more trouble.  Yeah, no, I think that's true.  I think that's true for two reasons. 
[02:48:30]  Isn't that weird, though?  Is that the way we're raised?  Well, I think that celebrities, first of all, especially people like a Heath Ledger,  feel like part of our family.  Oh, my God. 
[02:49:00]  I think that this guy needs to be put off the...  Off the...  Can you help me here?  Yeah, no problem, Jody.  That's very inappropriate.  Sorry, Dr. Gold, again.  It's really not appropriate.  And we're trying to have a serious conversation about how to talk to kids and why this is such  a big deal.  And I think part of it's because these celebrities feel like part of our family.  Yeah.  We know more about these celebrities' personal lives than we know about many of our family 
[02:49:30]  members' personal lives.  So I think it's much more like a family member dying.  Thank God for our dump button.  My God.  What do you think about the people that think that this has something to do with the movie  roles he has taken on in his short career?  I don't think that could have any bearing on it.  You know, it's an interesting point.  You know, and I'm not really sure what to make of that.  He's taken on a whole bunch of really serious roles. 
[02:50:00]  And I understand from people that have interviewed him that he says that he gets very, very into  the roles.  Ah.  Yeah.  Which was very disturbing knowing that he was the star of Brokeback Mountain, if you  know what I mean.  Well, I don't mean that they emulate the behavior in any way.  No, no.  I just think that in order to get into a character, and he clearly took his work very seriously,  Do you think this proves that God doesn't like, you know, the homosexual? 
[02:50:30]  No, I don't think so at all.  I read an article that appeared in the Houston Gazette.  You're playing the devil's advocate here now, I'm sure.  It was an editorial, and they were discussing God's role in the death of Heath Ledger.  Let's go to Roland, right here from New York.  Roland would like to talk to Dr. Gold.  Roland, you're on.  Hello.  Hi, Roland.  Yes, Roland.  Hi.  I'm listening. 
[02:51:00]  It seems, why is there so much attention being paid to a famous person?  Like, how come we don't care for each other?  That's a very good question.  Yeah, it's a really good point.  I mean, we should care about each other as much as we care about this.  I have to agree with you.  I think that what we can learn from this is that it increases awareness.  About what, though?  I'm not sure about what, because I'm very careful. 
[02:51:30]  Well, I think some of it's going to depend on, you know, as we further understand what happened.  Ramon!  Travis's dog!  That's my balls!  He keeps on coming back, this guy.  Oh, my gosh.  We, um...  Ramon!  I pulled a quarter out of Heath Ledger's cold buttocks!  Well, maybe we can...  I really think it's time to cut this guy off.  Yeah, we can cut that guy off.  A doctor... 
[02:52:00]  Ramon!  Yes, perhaps, doctor, maybe we could try this again some other time.  Our phones, it's ridiculous with this gentleman calling in.  Yeah, we're in the middle of a radio war with NPR and they're sending their people our way.  Yeah, I want to apologize.  I want to apologize for that.  Thank you.  But you gave us a lot of insight today.  Yes, absolutely.  Well, I appreciate it.  And if I can be of help, any more help, please let me know.  Oh, thank you so much, Dr. Gold. 
[02:52:30]  Any other interviews today?  I'm sure you're a very busy gal.  Well, I think that there may be later on.  Yeah.  And we'll see what happens.  Sorry about that.  It happens.  A guy calls once in a while.  We apologize.  Oh, I know.  No, it's okay.  But I know that it's a fun show, but you also have to remember...  You've got to take the serious with the serious and you've got to take the silly...  I thought I was talking, but you go right ahead.  Sorry, I didn't mean to actually chime in.  Right about you.  Go ahead.  Go.  I'm sorry?  No, no.  I'm saying I think you've got to take the serious with the serious and you've got to separate 
[02:53:00]  the silly with the silly.  Sure.  I've got to go right ahead.  You jump in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I think having a little bit of silliness, I mean, that's one of the ways we deal with  trauma and we deal with treatment is that sometimes a little bit of humor is appropriate.  Right.  You just reiterate and steal it and make it your point.  Go ahead.  Speaking of the humor, Dr. Jodi Gold, can you apologize to our listeners that might have  been offended when you kind of laughed when we were talking about the death of Heath  Ledger?  I think you all embarrassed me a little bit and I wasn't expecting that and I didn't expect  to speak about the nudity, so I do apologize. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  If anybody was offended.  Not accepted.  But I think what's important is not to emphasize that.  Do you take full responsibility for your actions?  Of course she does.  She said, Dr. Psychiatry.  Yeah.  Just calm down.  I think this is quite a serious, um...  Very serious subject.  Extremely.  I mean, joking aside, I didn't think of anything more serious than this.  Especially the accidental death of someone and what happens is...  The fact that our economy is completely collapsing and this is getting more covered.  This is very important.  Well, we think that a lot of times what happens is that when a celebrity dies, the public tends 
[02:54:00]  to take it more seriously than the actual problem itself.  Right.  It seems like the awareness is only brought because of the celebrity as opposed to the  problem.  Yeah.  Um...  Yeah, I think that...  Oh, you want to talk?  Okay, go ahead.  I wasn't quite finished, but go ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Um...  No, it's fine.  Don't have to finish.  Yeah, that's fine.  Because who cares about me, right?  Not about me.  Uh...  I think it's just important to take...  It's, uh... 
[02:54:30]  Look, obviously, we're all on edge, you know.  Yeah.  No, I understand.  Jimmy, you know.  She's trying to help us out here.  It's upsetting in the sense that, like, you know, you like a guy, you follow his career.  Right.  And, you know, it's almost like, I don't know why we separate the celebrity from ourselves.  Sure.  But we do.  It's a natural thing.  And then you find yourself, like, in this helpless position of, like, this guy who I  really enjoyed, and I loved his work, and he made me laugh, he made me cry, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  All of a sudden, he's gone.  And it's kind of frustrating that it had to happen so senselessly at such a young age. 
[02:55:00]  No, no, I agree.  And we should take all of these things seriously.  All right.  I didn't mean to actually start, uh...  Go ahead.  No, it's all right.  I tend to pause a lot.  Doc, that was your fault there.  I guess you don't really know the show, but Jimmy has a way of expressing himself, where  he does pause for a dramatic effect, and you kind of step all over it.  No, that's all right.  I mean, I know it's not to be disrespectful, but I'm like, I'm actually in a weird thing  with this, and you just, you know, I'm just kind of trying to, like, get some out there,  and you're kind of running through a rough shot.  I think everybody's feeling a little weird today with this whole thing. 
[02:55:30]  It's kind of a depressing day.  I know we had the idiotic calls, but that guy does it every time we have an interview,  so there's nowhere to go.  Yeah, I am.  Yeah, I apologize if I'm interrupting you.  Would you like me to continue, or do you...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  I want to hear your opinion, but I want this to be a back and forth, as opposed to...  Oh, soliloquy.  Okay.  No, I...  My thing about celebrity is we tend to, uh... 
[02:56:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  I'm waiting for your response.  I'm sorry, I think I lost you.  No, no, no, right here, right here.  No, there was a...  Yeah, that was a very good, uh, statement by, uh, Jim.  What I'm saying is, do you feel that the overrating of it...  Like, we tend to separate ourselves from celebrities.  Is the reason for that because of this whole esteem thing we used for diversionary reasons, 
[02:56:30]  or is it basically because we like to focus on a famous person,  which by proxy allows us to, uh, you know, completely never have that,  you know, come back, at least in a full circle.  Right, yeah.  So you're wondering about how we relate to celebrities?  That's the point I've been trying to make for a half hour, yes.  Sorry about that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no, go ahead.  Um, I do think that we overly relate to celebrities.  I think that we get so much information about them,  and they feel so larger than life that we really do relate very closely to them. 
[02:57:00]  And so when something tragic like this happens, um, it's, it's hard.  It's like feeling like, it's like having a family member.  Hello.  I'm doing a radio interview, you cunt.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Uh, doctor?  Yes.  I'm here.  Yeah, it seems that, uh...  Stupid girlfriend calls in the middle of the show. 
[02:57:30]  She knows I'm on the air.  Your girlfriend calls during the show?  Always.  They get her stupid questions in.  Okay.  Yeah, they feel like they're part of the show.  It's kind of awkward.  Ask you this.  Ask you that.  Shut up.  Ask yourself, bitch.  But the answer to the last question was not heard by our listeners,  because, uh, I don't know what happened,  but we seem to have lost her for about 15, 20 seconds there.  Oh, do you want me to repeat it?  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you have a book out or something like that, too?  Because you obviously know what you're talking about.  I appreciate that. 
[02:58:00]  I don't have a book out.  Um, I, um...  I'm saying that I think it was celebrities.  We learned so much about that.  Yes, we know.  We got to that already.  The next point.  Oh, the next point.  But it's feeling like our family members passed away?  Because they're so close to us?  Hello?  I don't know if that's the truth, though.  Hello?  I don't know.  Hello?  I'm here.  What happened?  Are you on a cell phone?  I'm on a cell phone, yeah.  Oh, that mug is cutting in and out.  Yeah, start.  Start.  Uh, what was the last thing we heard? 
[02:58:30]  I heard something.  It was something about, I'm sorry, and then family, and we have a tendency to not.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah.  Um, I think that because we care so much about the celebrities, and we know so much about  their personal lives, that they become, for many people, like family.  Yeah.  So when something tragic happens, it feels like, for some people, that a family member dies.  So true.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  What the hell's going on?  Are you still hearing me?  Or am I going in and out?  Uh, you...  We were hearing, like, every other word that time. 
[02:59:00]  Okay.  I'll try to project more.  I think that what I was saying was about how celebrities become to feel like family  members to us, because we know so much about them.  Can you hear her?  And they're larger, larger than life.  No.  And you're getting her?  I was, but...  What happened?  I don't know.  I'm going to walk away and speak.  Hello?  Hi, I'm here.  Yeah, maybe you're in a...  Oh, okay.  Are you in one of those, uh, because my carrier is crazy, and it's like, there's certain sections  where it just drops out.  I can kind of...  You're saying something.  I know you're raising a very good point about family, and how we feel like we've lost a family member. 
[02:59:30]  Yes, I think that, um, because we know so much about them, and they feel so much more  larger than life, that they feel like family members.  Yeah.  And so when they die, and it becomes very tragic.  And the fact that we treat them as larger than life, it feels even more tragic, because  we feel like they're invincible, and nothing can happen to them.  Yeah. 
[03:00:00]  You hear that?  Oh my God, my coffee went down the wrong way.  Yeah, so, that's very interesting, Doc.  But why do we not associate our fellow citizens in the same thing?  Is it because we want...  I mean, again, I'm not knocking the age of celebrity.  I mean, I love a good celebrity thing.  But to watch the media outside, I mean, it's just enough to make your balls crawl.  I have to agree with you on that one.  I think it's unfortunate the amount of publicity that these kinds of things get.  And I'm not always sure that it's helpful. 
[03:00:30]  I'm not sure that it always respects the privacy of the family.  Right.  But I think that's sort of reflective of a lot of these celebrities' lives.  They die in the way they lived.  No one respected their privacy.  And when they die, no one respects their privacy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's...  I think that's what you sign up for, though, Doc, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it's about...  You buy a ticket on this ride, you know?  Oh, you sure do.  I mean, there's no victims, only volunteers.  But...  And it's not even...  Like, he seemed like a nice man, and he seemed like a good family man.  But now there's all the speculation.  They jumped to suicide and the nudity, like the whole Monroe thing. 
[03:01:00]  The whole Merlin Monroe.  Do you see a comparison with Merlin Monroe?  I think that's...  Liar, whore!  Liar, whore!  Yeah.  I think that's what I want us not to do, is to jump to conclusions, because we are still  completely...  Liar, whore!  Liar, whore!  You know it!  I know.  That's what I was...  Well, let me ask you a question.  If he was not as famous, do you think?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:01:30]  Well, do you?  Hello?  I didn't hear you that.  You didn't hear the last part of that?  No.  All right.  Well, it was a very good question.  Can you repeat it?  Wouldn't it have been as big a deal?  Right.  Hello?  Hi, I'm here.  I'm not hearing any questions.  If you wasn't as famous...  Right. 
[03:02:00]  God, how many times do we have to repeat the question?  It's getting frustrating.  I can understand that.  No, don't worry.  We're sorry.  It's just, like I said, everybody's a little...  We're all a little on edge here.  We're in a weird mood today.  It's a little weird.  A little weird here.  Yeah.  It sounds like it.  Yeah.  All right.  And maybe, you know, in closing...  Wow, this really stinks.  Final, you know...  This whole thing stinks, I gotta tell you. 
[03:02:30]  Is it something that's gonna change?  The way these people have perceived it...  And again, I know you talked a little bit about the kids.  It's very sad to have to tell, like, kids this type of stuff.  Because you gotta sit down and tell them how, like, the guy in the movie that you liked  is no longer around to do the interviews that you always enjoyed him in.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, are you a parent yourself?  Yes, I am.  Okay.  If you could just...  What would you probably say, like, if it was your little kid or whatever?  How would you explain it in a way that they can understand that's not gonna hurt them  and yet enable them to move on? 
[03:03:00]  Well, mine's quite young, so they're one in three.  So I'm probably not gonna have this discussion with them.  But with kids that are a little bit older and that really understand what's going on  and are seeing it on the news, I would sit down with them.  At first, I would ask them what they've heard and what they know.  I wouldn't...  And then go with that.  And then help them to understand that sometimes very sad and tragic things do happen.  And help them to understand that he's not coming back.  Again, I think it really depends on how old the child is you're talking to. 
[03:03:30]  But I think giving the child a place to sit and talk with a parent that's calm,  and willing to listen is really important.  Are you guys still there?  Hello? 
[03:04:00]  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  hello hello hello hello hello  okay that was fucking brutal oh was that brutal hey look she seems like a nice enough lady she 
[03:04:30]  certainly does i mean come on wow on the news to talk about talk about the kids how could you be  honestly tolerating that nonsense you should have hung up immediately my favorite part the jimmy  farts and when you can't talk trying to do it ramon i almost laughed as stupid steve from yellow  she thought you were like tearing up or something oh like she heard you go oh my god

[03:27:00]  by the way i made it to a five-star uh general on call of duty yeah and like a real man and not a  pussy boy i uh opted for the prestige option which cash in all your guns all your experience and  everything over and you start completely over at number one the first level private again but you  get a little symbol that lets everyone know that you started over again oh that's pretty cool yeah  and then each time you do that you get to level 55 and start over you get a new symbol and you go 
[03:27:30]  over and over until you get a gold cross for doing it 10 times and then what happens 550 levels  uh then what happens uh as than says what are you doing after you uh are done with this prestige  then oh i'm putting my game in the drawer he's just throwing it away not playing anymore it's a  terrible use of time it's just a complete waste of time isn't it yeah i'd like to develop myself you 
[03:28:00]  know physically work out every now and then yeah do some open mics more but no i'm glued but you're  just sitting there in the middle of my apartment oh yeah have you been getting up on stage at all  yeah yeah no it's weird though if you spent the same amount of time that you do like playing  call of duty 4 or whatever in the gym yeah you would be a monster uh yeah because it's it's hours on  end when when you go to the gym it's usually for what an hour and a half two hours at the most never 
[03:28:30]  half hour but 40 minutes see a lot of people half hour 40 minutes things like that at the gym yeah  a half hour an hour depends on what i got it under an hour too yeah yeah 40 to 45 minutes i'll motivate  myself to go sometimes i'll say to myself i don't want to go to the gym and i'll say jimmy get down  to the gym for a half hour jim go to the gym get to the gym gym go to the gym don't not go to the  gym jimmy you're gonna feel like you should have been at the gym go get on the jungle gym  could you imagine eight hours in the gym every day yes or at least six hours you'd be you'd be a 
[03:29:00]  monster in no time but just play that fucking game but then why aren't our thumbs really big  yeah how come we don't have real muscular thumbs because it doesn't take real muscles yeah if you  had like like biceps on your inner thumb and it was impressive like they ought to put heavy springs in  those controllers so you're really working out and then you go dude and curl and you're curling your  thumbs up and it's just making this giant muscle yeah thumb biceps pot talk wednesday or something 
[03:29:30]  yeah all right hey uh this is gonna kill two minutes and then we're gonna kill a minute oh  no i was just gonna say because the game keeps track of exactly how long you've been playing yeah  yeah what did you look what you were up to i'm up to four days four days okay see i got i got half  that all right which makes me feel better i'm gonna just a few people so don't get pissed off i'm  putting it all together and and i'm i'm i'm i'm kind of doing this for a bunch of instant feedback

[03:44:00]  by the way when you thought that was the end uh i was reminded that we have a whole  a whole eye news thing happening here really yeah that was one of three eye stories that came in  all at the same guy no fucking eye eater  no yeah he likes his iphone and his imac  and imus here's another eye story  another boo another eye story a foda family is speaking out this morning about a vicious attack 
[03:44:30]  that permanently injured a 14 year old autistic boy the boy's accused attacker is his own aunt  investigators say lisa babington stood over the teenager's bed while he slept and  stabbed him in both eyes she then stabbed one of her own eyes alex's grandmother was home when it  happened and said his aunt said she had to do it well i panicked i totally panicked because  i couldn't believe what i had seen alex lost his left eye and will never fully regain his eyesight in 
[03:45:00]  his right eye lisa babington is in jail charged with attempted murder oh so there was an eyewitness  that's uh oh well that's why wouldn't they just kill her kill her yeah leave the autistic kid alone  got nothing to worry about i uh what you know what happened with that woman she stabbed herself in the  eye yeah was probably gonna go for both and just went wow that really hurts i don't think i could do the 
[03:45:30]  other one all right that's a pretty hard story you want the final eye story uh sure okay i i  she's only six years old in the first raid but she became the target of a vicious attack as soon as  the door came open that's when she threw the knife right at my baby tina curtis says these three sisters  and a boyfriend busted in the door to their avondale apartment and 19 year old precious white threw a  large kitchen knife right at little janisha hitting her directly in her right eye if you wanted to 
[03:46:00]  get me so bad on my sister why didn't you get me why did you have to hurt my baby the intruders took  off janisha was rushed to children's hospital but it was too late the damage so severe her eye had to  be removed doctors warned if it wasn't janisha could lose her left eye too a devastating diagnosis for tina  who knows this will be something her little girl's gonna have to deal with for the rest of her life  how fucking terrible that's awful why don't you throw a knife at a baby she probably do you think 
[03:46:30]  she threw it at the baby or just threw it wildly i don't know i wasn't there i was  fucking right in the eye yeah that's uh that's all i think about her eye i read about school i read  about if the kid's gonna pick on her or say something about her amazingly janisha is the one  who comforts her mother tonight she never said she's scared she never said she was in pain she's strong  she real strong but she has a long road ahead of her she'll undergo her third surgery on friday and 
[03:47:00]  from there the best scenario is janisha will get a glass eye if she does that will be months away  and we'll take yet another surgery  jimmy farted again god i got one more in me i know it  uh by the way i'm getting jimmy i'm getting a boo for my eyewitness  why that was good well yeah but john from virginia you know they're gonna forget about my eyewitness  line because john writes uh were these stories on eyewitness news eyewitness news
