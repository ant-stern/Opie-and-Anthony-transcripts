<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the usual bombastic introduction, followed by banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy. Anthony bragged about his wealth and lifestyle, before the conversation shifted to NFL football, focusing on controversial calls and the performances of various teams (Cowboys, Giants, Jets, Broncos), heavily criticizing Tim Tebow's post-game religious pronouncements.  A lengthy discussion followed on "The Virgin Diaries," featuring graphic descriptions of the show's participants' first sexual experiences, punctuated by homophobic remarks from the hosts.  Neil Patrick Harris's apology for using the word "tranny" sparked a debate about the term's offensiveness and GLAAD's reaction.  "Science Bob" then provided a science segment demonstrating the effects of different gases on the voice, referencing *The Silence of the Lambs*.  The show continued with a discussion of an Occupy Wall Street protester securing a Wall Street job, followed by commentary on the Herman Cain scandal and a crude, sexually explicit re-enactment of a scene from *The Silence of the Lambs*.

A call-in segment offered technical support, followed by a stand-up routine from Uncle Nino filled with offensive jokes. The hosts then discussed the death of Patrice O'Neal, the upcoming tribute special, and the emotional aspects of funerals and open vs. closed caskets.  The Herman Cain scandal, John Jones' upcoming fight, and speculation about O.J. Simpson's prison life were also discussed.  Joe DeRosa joined in-studio to promote his show at Caroline's, and the segment concluded with discussions about the Mall of America, Hulk Hogan, and a graphic description of a cyber sex fantasy.  Throughout this portion, vulgar language and offensive jokes were prevalent.

A significant portion focused on Hulk Hogan's divorce and Linda Hogan's substantial financial settlement, with the hosts and guest Bill Burr reacting with disbelief and highly offensive language.  The conversation shifted to stand-up comedy and audience reactions, particularly to material about women and aging, with Joe DeRosa sharing his experiences.  UFC champion John Jones then joined in-studio, discussing his fights, training, and personal anecdotes, including a humorous story about a street fight and the differences between American and Japanese UFC fans.  The segment ended with Jones delivering a leg kick to Jim Norton, causing him significant pain.

Further discussion of the shin kick to Jim Norton ensued, with details about martial arts training and kicking techniques.  The conversation continued to UFC 140 and upcoming fights, with Jones promoting his own and others.  Bill Burr and Joe DeRosa remained in-studio.  A tribute to Patrice O'Neal followed, with a call from Chris Rock sharing anecdotes and memories.  Many stories detailed O'Neal's comedic style, interactions with other comedians, and larger-than-life personality.  The hosts and guests expressed grief and admiration for O'Neal.  The "F.U." segment included listener calls.


The show continued with recurring themes:  anecdotes about a person's loud shushing habit, further stories about Patrice O'Neal, and experiences at the Comedy Cellar.  These included stories about O'Neal's ability to diffuse tense situations with humor, his verbal roasts of other comedians (Jim Norton, Bobby Kelly, Bill Burr), and his big laugh.  Bobby Kellyâ€™s weight and eating habits were also discussed.  The hosts discussed their relationships with other comedians, including Roland.  The call-in segment with Jon Jones and the shin kick to Jim Norton was mentioned again. The show concluded with promotions for Joe DeRosa's show,  discussion of the aftermath of O'Neal's death,  and the .com to .xxx transition of pornographic websites. Bill Burr remained a prominent guest throughout.

The final segment included mention of a video of the shin kick to be posted online, a sponsorship announcement by Trojan condoms, Anthony's upcoming appearance on Sterniolo's Raw Dog show, promotion of a shorter Patrice O'Neal special, and final plugs for their Facebook page and broadcast times.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, and now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for.  Today's Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now.  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony show starts now. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony channel.  XM 105, series 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony.  I live in a big house, I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:04:00]  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening, it sounds like a little...  Fuck.  He's the day over in, it only's the day over here.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning. 
[00:04:30]  Hi there, peoples.  People's out there.  Lol.  Rail and.  Lol, lol, lol.  Monday, mon.  Monday, mon.  Monday.  Good morning.  Good morning.  We were just discussing football.  Oh, yeah.  All our teams played.  What's your team again?  I don't have one.  I know what happened in football from my drive-in.  That's about it.  Yeah, you get caught up.  There were some good games, though. 
[00:05:00]  Well, Jimmy's Cowboys fucked it up.  I heard that the timeout, I didn't watch the game.  Good.  Yeah.  I only saw the highlights, so I don't know why they were going for the timeout.  And asked, because we were watching the highlights before the show.  Yeah, that one seemed really stupid.  I assume the coach there saw something on the field he didn't like, so he wanted to call a timeout to maybe do a little adjustment.  But, you know, he called the timeout in time, but the play already started. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And what's his name?  Kicked the fucking field goal to win the game.  But no, because of the timeout, they had to do it again.  And then he fucking missed the fucking field goal.  Then he missed.  He froze his own kicker, basically, is what a lot of people are saying today.  That's a pretty dumb thing to do.  Yeah.  Why'd they give the timeout if the play had already started?  Well, no.  I mean, it's a timing thing.  Like, officially, he got the timeout in time.  But the guys on the field didn't know.  Snapped the ball, dude. 
[00:06:00]  It was like that split-second thing.  Oh, how awful.  Yeah.  That's not good.  That was not good for your Cowboys there.  Well, at least the Giants lost.  At least the Redskins lost.  And the Eagles are not still lost.  So Cowboys still in first, right?  Are my Cowboys still in first?  How do I get my Jets won?  Oh, shit.  You're not a Jets fan.  I am.  My Jets beat the Redskins.  Yeah, the Giants game.  That's a heartbreaker for Giants fans.  I am no Giants fan.  Yeah, they lost that one at the end of the game, I guess.  Yeah, that was a field goal, too.  And goal-packed goal. 
[00:06:30]  Still undefeated.  Undefeated Green Bay, huh?  I couldn't watch my Jets because I was in Philly this weekend.  Yeah.  And they blacked out the game.  I'm like, come on, man.  I'm close enough.  Isn't Philly in between Washington and New York?  Do I have to look on a map?  So why wouldn't Philly have the game?  The Eagles weren't playing.  They weren't playing?  They went with the Steelers, I guess.  So I get it, I guess.  But I mean, come on.  Why did they black it out when I showed both? 
[00:07:00]  The Jets are like just north and Washington is south.  Give me the fucking Jets-Redskins game.  Where were you that didn't have...  I was down in Philly this weekend.  You were closer to New York than you were to Pittsburgh.  I know.  And you were closer to D.C. than you were to Pittsburgh.  I know.  That's what I'm trying to get at here.  That's terrible.  So I had to watch, you know...  No Red Zone?  Well, they had the Red Zone downstairs.  And I was upstairs with the kid.  Oh, Jesus.  So you could have seen.  And I got all excited. 
[00:07:30]  I popped on the Red Zone on the upstairs TV.  And they don't have it upstairs.  And I was too lazy to go downstairs.  Oh, okay.  Now it's making more sense.  I was lazy.  Okay.  I just wanted to kind of chill upstairs with my kid.  And so I had to watch God's chosen son, Tim Tebow.  Well, he's thanking Jesus.  You know, at this point...  For this game yesterday.  I want to like the guy.  But you saw it, too.  They're like, hey, Tim, what do you think of the big win today?  And he's like, first, first, let's all slow down first. 
[00:08:00]  First of all, let me thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Hey, shut up with that shit.  It's like the first thing.  Jesus is going to be mad if he just goes, you know, hey, let me thank, you know, my coach.  A lot of people are trying to figure out why he's hated.  That is why he's hated.  It's not that he likes the God thing.  It's how he comes across and everything has to be God first.  First, first, let's do this.  And then I'll talk about the game.  Well, he'll have a seat at the right hand of God while we're all burning in hell. 
[00:08:30]  Well, so there he wins again.  Enjoy.  He's six and one as a starter, though.  Although he was supposed to beat the Vikings.  The Vikings are not a good team this year.  Where was Jesus that one game?  That one game?  He didn't win.  I think that was the first game he came in, right?  I think.  Oh, and Jesus didn't know he was playing?  No.  Jesus was busy with a tsunami or something and said, wait, what?  It's like, wait, Tim Tebow's playing.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I believe that's what happened.  Did he thank Jesus that game?  Because he probably shouldn't have thanked him. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, I'm sure he did.  For what?  The loss?  I'm sure he thanked him for putting him in.  I don't know.  Yes.  But he's starting to turn into a pretty decent-looking quarterback.  He actually threw this time, too, Ant.  Yeah.  He had over 200 yards passing.  That's impressive in the NFL.  Wow.  Can we hear him talk?  Is it possible to hear him talk?  Yes.  I enjoy hearing him talk.  The Lord loves me.  Oh, the Bible damned me.  I'll tell you.  Not everything's for the air, but when he talked today, Ed had a few choice words. 
[00:09:30]  Well, I was saying he sounds a bit effeminate.  Yeah, he does.  I think.  You know how much pussy this guy would be getting if he wasn't into the Jesus?  Jesus.  He could get that Jesus.  Is he?  When he finally, like, kisses something, is it going to be like the Virgin Diaries?  Oh, God.  I hope for his sake he's at least kissed girls on the mouth.  On the mouth.  Not like that fucking, not like that guy that really should figure out that he's gay. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Guy from Virgin Diaries last night.  Yeah.  Do we have longer clips of that kiss?  Yeah.  They show, like, them kissing during the, like, reception now and everything.  And it's just, he does just distinguish his mouth.  It's almost like Edgar.  But it's a little pointier, like a turtle mouth.  Oh, God.  And then he just starts sucking and biting on our face.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  And then the other Virgin guy that was on it, I mean, I assume he's gay.  And then the three Virgin chicks that were roommates, I assume they're all lesbian. 
[00:10:30]  They just, especially the guys on that show, they just seem like gay guys that don't know they're gay yet.  And the guy who got married made the mistake you could hear when he was talking.  And he was like, after we kissed, she just, she wanted to kiss more and more.  And I'm like, slow down.  Yeah, yeah.  This is weird.  What?  What's weird about that?  When they, when that fucking guy says, you know, I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may kiss to Brian.  He goes, oh, you really?  Right.  And then she's, she's miked. 
[00:11:00]  And all you're hearing is, I swear, you hear her panting.  We need clips of this show.  Where's the clips of the show?  She, they lift up her veil.  Yeah.  She starts fucking making out.  And her hands, you can see on the bottom part of the screen, her hands are flapping.  Oh my God.  She's flapping her arms like she's coming as they're kissing.  We could all relate to that, but it happened when we were what?  Well, 12, 13.  I wish.  I was a late bloomer, unfortunately.  Bloomer.  14 or 15 for me, to be honest with you. 
[00:11:30]  That's fine.  At least you'd say you're not fucking 30.  And you know what?  You just let it flow, man.  You don't tell anyone to slow down.  You're making out.  You're making comsies.  You're making comsies.  The best was the end of the show.  Yeah.  When they finally talked to them after their wedding night.  Right.  They talked to them after the sex.  Oh boy.  And his description.  Oh boy.  Of what happened.  And hers too.  They're both like kind of sitting with kind of little disappointed looks on their face.  And they're like, ah, well, it's not like in the movies. 
[00:12:00]  You know, their thing, everyone knows what to do.  And it's just not, you know.  You think it lasted seconds?  And she's like, it hurt.  It really hurt.  That means he's packing.  He had a big dick.  He's got a big dick.  Or he was just a lousy fuck.  Just like fucking.  I think that's more big dick than lousy fuck.  Big cock.  He's got a hog.  Big cock.  You think?  He didn't look like the type that would have a big dick.  That's the beauty of it.  What a discovery.  It was probably very turgid for having not been, you know, used. 
[00:12:30]  So he probably was like a fucking piece of granite.  I think it was just pulsating.  Just smacking her.  Yeah.  He felt it.  She felt his pulse inside her vagina the whole time.  I want clips from this show, Sam.  Yeah.  We need the end.  What happened?  I think the end clip where they talk about the sex.  That's great.  And then the other guy, the dumb fat idiot.  The nerd?  That says he's a virgin.  The nerdy guy, right?  And he's like, not by choice.  Not by choice.  A mother's coming by tonight and we're going to discuss my date. 
[00:13:00]  I'm going to cook her lasagna and I love making fudge.  Yeah.  And it's like he set up dinner with his mother.  It looked like a fucking date.  He had two glasses of wine on the table.  And it's like this guy is just, he's gay.  He doesn't want to admit it to himself for some reason, but.  You think the fudge thing is a tell?  He's making fudge in his little bachelor kitchen.  He's got cats.  He just, it's everything pointed to, my gaydar detector was beeping like crazy. 
[00:13:30]  Cats are rough, right?  Cats.  Single guy with cats?  Yeah.  You go dog over cat.  That's rough.  Sorry.  Sorry.  But, and then he goes to a bar.  First he goes on a date and tells this fatty that he's a virgin on the date.  And she doesn't even want to fuck him.  And then he goes out with his friends and it's just some gin mill shithole bar.  And some dikey spiky hair hag who's older than he is comes, comes up and starts like grinding 
[00:14:00]  her ass on his crotch and licking his shaved head.  And like, really, she's drunk and all of his friends are like, yeah, she wants to do this.  You know, go ahead.  And then they come back at the end of the show and talk to him and goes, yeah, I could have.  I know I did.  But, you know, sometimes you're just not attracted to somebody.  It's like at that point, just shoot your load in a vagina and get over the fact that you're a virgin.  And that's now totally engulfing your entire life. 
[00:14:30]  Right.  Like the whole virgin thing.  And those three bitches.  Actually, two girls were virgins.  One was a reclaimed virgin.  Stop that shit.  What is that?  Oh, does that mean she was molested?  It's like trying to reclaim Kennedy's brains after the fucking shot.  It ain't going to happen.  Well, what's a reclaimed virgin?  She had sex with like six guys.  And then she decided she wanted to be a virgin again.  So, I don't know.  What did she go?  Mecca, like a high mecca, high me, high me, high me, high me, ho?  What did she go to the doctor and get a couple stitches?  Yeah, a couple of stitches.  Let's tighten that up again. 
[00:15:00]  And then she's fucking...  I'm reclaiming my virginity.  She's, you know, sitting with these other two who are legit virgins.  You got Coke Logic on your bad side, by the way, because he has cats.  He wants to know what the hell is gay about cats.  He is not happy with you, sir.  All right, Coke Logic, you're fruit.  Exactly.  Well, if you're allowed to have dogs and you go cats, eh.  But if you're an animal lover and you decide cat over dog...  No, he's a shut-in.  He's a shut-in, so he likes the cats who doesn't have to leave the house.  Cat with a single guy doesn't mean gay.  But it's part of a puzzle that if you have your mom over to discuss that you're a virgin 
[00:15:30]  and discuss your fucking date that you're going out on, your first date in eight months,  and then you cook for your mommy and put out little glasses of wine for her,  and you make fudge, and you're a virgin at 30 years old, and then you have cats.  But it's a good point.  I mean, you could be a shut-in.  Yeah.  Someone like Coke Logic isn't going to leave his house to walk a dog,  but at least a cat can shit wherever the fuck he wants.  Yes.  You're safe, Coke Logic.  Cha.  We give you a pass. 
[00:16:00]  But it was like that guy just didn't understand.  And he didn't want to have sex with a crazy girl at the bar.  Right.  At the end, he said, no, I'm not attracted.  It's like, no, just do it.  It's like, oh, people have said I should get a prostitute.  I don't want my first time to be like that.  It's like, stop with putting this big thing on the first fucking time, especially at 30.  Maybe if you're 15 years old, you're really concentrating on how special that first time's going to be if you're a chick.  I think, what do you think?  Most, the average guy around 13, 14 until you lose your virginity is a big deal. 
[00:16:30]  And then you get it out of the way.  I made it nice for girls.  A little candlelight by my fucking pull-out bed.  I'm sure you did.  And a little Marshall Tucker playing.  Can't you see?  Come, can't you see?  That's it.  You made it all nice.  That's for the lady.  And then I suggested to one of the girls that, you know, because I went down on her.  And then I suggested to her that maybe she go down on me.  And she was, she's like, I just don't know how.  I've never done it.  I'm like, that matters. 
[00:17:00]  She goes, my friend told me to practice on a banana.  Oh, that old gag.  Like, all right, whatever you want to do.  Best times, it was.  I think I got one inside.  Best times, it was a carrot, right?  Yeah.  You got to go carrot.  Go carrot.  How much comes out when a guy comes?  About a quarter or so.  A quarter.  Did she suck it?  She was horrified.  Uh, not that night.  Oh, okay.  But she did.  Later on.  Did she get the candy?  She was a fine trooper.  Nah, you know what?  Never got the candy.  She didn't get the candy?  Back in those days, girls weren't so sexually promiscuous with their mouths and assholes. 
[00:17:30]  It was very tough to get a girl to fucking suck until you came in her mouth.  It really was.  They'd fucking wah, wah, wah, but then you got to, you know, just have some regular sex  to bore you alone.  Where were we?  Tim Tebow?  Oh, shit.  And I want this Virgin Diary audio, man.  I want to hear some of this shit.  Yeah, you got to get that.  I didn't realize it was on last night.  I was too busy watching football.  Anthony's really good at painting pictures.  Like, I'm so bad at that.  You're great at that, man.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's fucking difficult. 
[00:18:00]  It's all in my mind.  I would have talked for 30 seconds about that.  I really would have.  I'm doing this for a long time.  I would have said, dude, the fucking Chicks are virgins, get a paintbrush.  Start painting.  I'm very bad at that, dude.  Here's Tim Tebow after the game.  I kind of want to like this guy, but Jesus, enough with the Lord and Savior.  See how bad you want it.  And so, you know, I think I'm just proud of our guys because, you know, the way we came  out there in the second half, you could see that there was a different team.  Big.  Tim, was the plan to go with that bike in second year a little bit more today? 
[00:18:30]  They're depleted a little bit.  Eric Tebow came to town.  I think, you know, the main thing was we just wanted to be balanced and try to keep  them off balance as much as we could.  I think Coach McCoy did a great job of keeping them off balance, and we hit some big plays  there.  That ass is really telling.  DT stepped up and made so many huge plays, and, you know, that only comes because, you  know, they're eyeing back a little bit more, and so it's like another guy, you know,  but that's what it's all about, you know, on our team is helping the guy next to you,  and, you know, one game or another, you're going to get your opportunity. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, today was, you know, DT's opportunity, and he stepped up, and I'm so proud of him,  you know, because he's such a great guy, and he works so hard.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  He seems like a nice guy.  Yeah.  I bet you everybody on the team doesn't say it.  Do you think Tim sounds, yeah, he played a good game.  Yeah, good game, good game.  Sounds like a great quarterback.  He sure does.  Yeah, he sure does.  Sounds like he knows what he's doing.  You bet he does.  Nobody wants to acknowledge it.  No.  No.  They talk to him.  He sounds like this. 
[00:19:30]  The S's are all.  And the guy's always let me have the shower to myself, which is just so nice.  So I walk in, and they clear out like roaches.  The light's gone.  Oh, man.  He's getting a little more respect around the league now.  A little bit.  A little bit more.  Six and one as a starter.  Fucking the Broncos were dead in the water.  Now they're in first place.  With Jesus' help.  Because the Raiders got their ass kicked.  Raiders lost to Miami, right?  Did they?  34 to 14.  Fuck.  The Raiders. 
[00:20:00]  I can't wait till he loses in the playoffs.  Who?  They weren't even supposed to make the playoffs.  No, but then we'll see what he says about God.  Oh, yeah.  If they even make the playoffs, and it's looking pretty good right now, that's a major accomplishment  for the Broncos.  They were one and four to start the year.  Just want to see if he thanks God.  Another seven and five.  Humiliating loss.  Humiliating?  If he loses the playoffs, they're going to have a bad one.  Yeah.  I don't know.  They're becoming fun to watch, the Broncos. 
[00:20:30]  Fuck.  I watched them instead of the Jets.  Yeah.  Why isn't Patty on this show?  I agree.  Oh, the Virgin show?  Oh, the Virgin show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Frank, you're right.  I don't know.  Are they doing more than one?  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be like a...  But do you have to lose your virginity by the end of the show?  No.  That's just it.  Holy shit.  Patty should be on that thing.  The fat guy and the three bitches, the three girls went out on a blind date with three  guys.  Yeah.  And they were all like...  They showed him getting ready and talking about, oh, my special man's going to be this 
[00:21:00]  and that.  And then they went out on this date with three guys and they're sitting across from each  other in the booth talking.  And then the one girl goes, you know, I'm a virgin.  And then the one, so am I.  And so am I.  Well, I'm a reclaimed...  All right, shut up.  Enough of that.  And then they go, well, what do you think about that?  One of the guys starts talking.  He's like, I think it's great that, you know, you want that special somebody because, by  the way, I'm a virgin too.  And the guys go, I am too.  I am too.  And then I'm just looking at them like, gay.  And how old are they?  They were like in their 30s, like late 20s, 30s. 
[00:21:30]  That's a problem, man.  Yeah.  All you want to do is spill your semen by the time you hit puberty, right?  Yeah.  Then they talk about, oh, they talked about going, they went to a secluded little cabin  where they were joking about how perhaps some of the couches, they could all sleep, you  know, on couches in the cabin and have a good time.  And they didn't get home until three in the morning.  And then they're like, and the big question is, are we still virgins?  And then they look around and go, yes.  Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  And then all I could think of is yes, technically.  What about your mouth and your ass?  What about that?  You'd be a wonderful host for that show.  Especially if you had you right in their face with a bullhorn.  Yeah.  What about your mouth and your assholes?  Are those still virginal?  And Patty would be a star in this show.  Oh, yeah.  People would be out of their minds.  She's too old now, though.  Send her out on a date.  No, they're just looking for virgins.  They don't give a shit.  Dude, they would sign her up in a minute.  A fucking, how old is she now?  55?  Something like that. 
[00:22:30]  That's just sad now.  But she is crazy.  She's very TV.  Oh, they'd love her.  They would love her.  Just waiting for a special guard.  You have a dumb face.  Well, I'm very afraid of diseases.  People would be like, oh, my God.  Dude, you've got to fucking see this.  I DVR'd it.  Yeah, she would be perfect.  How do we get her on the show?  At the end of the show, they said if you know a virgin.  So let's get all our listeners to push Patty's name forward.  Check it out.  She'd be perfect.  Go to, what is it, on TLC? 
[00:23:00]  TLC.  Yeah, go to TLC's website.  I'm sure if you go to the show there, they'll have a little place where you can email them.  We have a clip we can play?  We'll probably get one.  What do you got?  What do you got?  That's the 30-year-old virgin.  Yeah, this is, he was on CNN.  Right now, the only things online are those preview clips that we already saw.  Oh, man, I want to see this.  Yeah, the end, when the couple talks about having sex with each other, it's so telling  that that marriage is doomed.  She's a horny fucking disaster, and he's just, I don't think he really likes sex, and I don't 
[00:23:30]  think it's that big a deal to him, or he would have lost his virginia a long time ago.  But this chick, I swear, she was panting.  It's great.  Plus, when she was kissing, it was like she was sucking his mouth, like she was attacking  him.  Oh, yeah, she wanted to, like.  Yeah, her kiss was bad, too.  Oh, terrible.  They were both terrible.  Hers could have been worse.  The whole time.  Yeah, she stuck her tongue out at one point and licked his face, and she, and he kissed 
[00:24:00]  her tongue as it was sticking out of her face.  It was just odd.  You know she had still breath when she was licking his face.  Oh, it didn't matter at that point.  Were you watching it as the show went on with those two, that they kept going in to kiss  each other, but they'd end up pretending they meant on the cheek, because they were just  not in sync at all?  Yeah, they didn't know how to, like, they were allowed to kiss now in their minds, because  they had been married, but they had been kissing on the cheek for so long that they would go  in, it was an odd thing, they would go in like they were gonna kiss on the mouth, and  then he'd go around the side and kiss a pecker on the cheek, and that's how they kissed 
[00:24:30]  for years that they were engaged.  Why don't we have clips of this show?  It's not online.  It's not online yet.  Yeah.  Maybe her breath stunk, and you want to kiss her.  Huh?  Maybe her breath stunk.  She probably had, like, fucking nervous breath, like sour nervous breath.  Yeah.  With little whites, you know that white milky stuff that collects in the corner?  Yeah, that's what I was saying.  Crackheads.  Schmegma.  Dry schmegma.  Yeah, in the corner of your lips.  People are saying Bobo, too, for the show.  Oh, God.  For the show.  I'm a virgin.  Look, look, by the way.  Oh, my.  He would be impossible. 
[00:25:00]  He would have a rod the whole time.  He was coming in his pants.  We're gonna blow it with TLC.  Let's focus on Patty, people.  Yeah, because Bobo seemed like an idiot.  Yeah, we're gonna blow it with the Bobo thing.  Let's get Patty on the show, and then we can move on to Bobo.  All right?  Let's do this.  Is there a tranny in the pal talk room jerking off?  Well, I'll see what I'm saying.  What is this?  Miss Bowles?  Miss Bowles.  Look at this.  That's a horrible name.  There's a...  You know, uh...  What the hell's going on with this room?  What do you mean before this?  Speaking of trannies, we can move on to our next subject here. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, good.  Neil Patrick Harris had to fucking apologize for saying tranny.  What?  On Live with whatever the fuck the name of the show is now.  But he's gay.  Is that like saying fag to them, like to transsexuals?  Do they see it like that?  Tranny is not good anymore?  They don't like it.  Neil Patrick Harris, who is openly gay, was filling in for Regis.  They're doing like, you know, a bunch of people until they figure out who's gonna take over for  Regis.  He, uh...  I don't know...  He turned that Regis stool upside down and invited three friends? 
[00:26:00]  I love that old gag.  Funny every time.  I know.  He was making a joke and then he, uh...  What...  What...  You got that, Sam?  Uh...  Yeah.  And he had to apologize for saying tranny now.  He quoted put the lotion in the basket on the show in his Buffalo Bill voice.  Right.  And then, uh...  He said, I've never sounded more like a tranny in my life.  So what's...  I guess they were doing like a Darth Vader thing.  What was he supposed to say?  But isn't that how a tranny would sound?  So what's the problem?  But he's using them as the reference in the punchline. 
[00:26:30]  Tough shit!  No matter how you said that, that might not be acceptable.  I've never sounded more like a transgendered person.  Yeah, exactly.  Transgendered.  Well, that would be a problem, too.  Because, again, he's using us as a reference in the punchline.  Oh, it's like, hey, they don't all sound like that.  Yes, they do.  They were inhaling anti-helium gas, which makes your voice deeper.  What's anti-helium gas?  It's like, you know...  Why haven't we done that yet?  Helium makes your voice high.  Nitrogen?  Yeah, I get it.  Whatever it was.  But there's something that makes it deep?  It would have to be a heavier gas than the air we breathe. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  Like, helium's lighter, so it makes you sound high-pitched.  Like a heavier gas?  Like what?  Like fucking...  It's crazy that you just know that.  I don't even know how to weigh gas.  Who the fuck knows why helium...  Why does helium do that?  Eh, because you eat it, and it makes your voice noisy.  Yeah, just kind of...  You know that.  I don't know.  I just pick things up.  I don't know how that happens.  But yeah, so Ripa did the Darth Vader impression while they had...  And then Neil Patrick Harris did the Buffalo Bill impression. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, okay.  And then he said, I've never sounded more like a tranny in my life.  And isn't Buffalo Bill kind of a tranny type of individual?  Yeah, absolutely.  Because we'd be in the movie, right?  It's hot.  So what's the problem?  Who the fuck had a problem with this?  The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, of course, Opie.  You know them as GLAAD.  And GLAAD did call it a slur.  Get the fuck out of here, GLAAD.  You can't make up slurs.  You can't start making up your own slurs and calling things slurs.  Well, until people stop apologizing. 
[00:28:00]  Like, he should have said...  And you're talking about a guy that's sensitive to that whole thing, and he felt like it was  okay to do.  You gotta relax, GLAAD.  You gotta fucking relax.  He wrote, truly sorry for saying the word tranny on live this week.  Twice.  Should have been more thoughtful.  Didn't mean to offend.  No, he was being thoughtful.  He thought that's perfectly fine.  His apology is the fact that he puts a penis in his ass.  That's good enough.  Right there.  That's unbelievable.  That should give him immunity. 
[00:28:30]  That's like an immunity idol in your ass.  Now you can't say tranny?  How do people even do TV at this point?  Dude, I have no idea.  It's impossible.  You can't make a joke and reference a tranny?  It's impossible.  We're supposed to understand trannies now?  Yeah.  How are we supposed to understand trannies?  Explain that to me.  First of all, it's a little weird to me still.  You're not saying tranny, sir.  Fuck that.  It's really strange.  I would never apologize for a tranny slur.  I would expect them all to come out and defend me as well.  No one has helped our community financially more than a joke. 
[00:29:00]  Holy fuck.  You're dressed like a woman.  You've got a deep voice.  And we're not supposed to acknowledge that might still be weird for a lot of people.  You just can't call them tranny.  That's a slur.  Why is it?  I don't know why.  Why is that?  Yeah, why is it?  Gladstaven just said,  it's heartening to see a celebrity of Harris's stature recognize and apologize for using  the slur in such a timely manner.  Oh, it's heartening as opposed to disheartening when they got it. 
[00:29:30]  I never heard heartening used.  Heartening.  Heartening.  Heartening.  It's disheartening and heartening.  I've never heard that.  Me neither.  Give me a break.  Neil Patrick Harris should not have had to apologize.  Tranny is a word.  Sure is.  Deal with it.  It is.  It's just a word.  It's a T word.  Well, it's a transgendered mission is what you have in your car.  That's why.  Yes.  I'm going to be left with any words we're allowed to utter.  Not especially when it comes to comedy. 
[00:30:00]  Not when it describes somebody in any way, shape or form.  That is not some technical term that those people made up themselves, no matter what group  it is.  That seems to be the criteria here.  What about just regular heterosexual, white, male, you know, why don't we come up with  some slurs?  What?  Employed American?  I hate that.  When entertain, or maybe, it must have been from Glad's statement because it was a quote,  Tranny, the A is asterisked out. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, man.  What?  Let me see.  Look, they didn't even print it on the site.  The way you asterisk, asterisk, F, like, blank, blank, K.  Just giving the word power, you idiots.  It's amazing how, what, what fucking.  You're just giving the word power.  You're putting the word in a spotlight, you dopes.  Tranny is one of the most hurtful and dehumanizing slurs that transgender people must hear.  Most transgender people associate that word with personal experiences of violence, hatred, 
[00:31:00]  and derision.  I don't believe that.  No, I don't either.  The tranny is, I believe you, if someone's going to punch a transsexual in the face,  they're going to call him a faggot.  Right.  Or a bitch.  They're not going to call him a tranny.  Let's beat up that tranny.  It doesn't even get right.  I don't believe that.  It doesn't sound right.  And we've all avoided that our entire lives because you don't want to be beat up by someone  that's wearing high heels and has a dick.  Fuck.  They're crazy.  Never would I fucking fight a transsexual.  No way.  I'm being a tranny.  That would be embarrassing.  It's a lose-lose situation. 
[00:31:30]  That's the Kobayashi Maru of fights.  I'm getting beat up and I have an erection.  They slash you with box cutters, man.  You can't fuck with them.  And then if you do beat up a tranny, you just...  Tranny's...  It's like, oh, what'd you do?  You beat up a fucking tranny.  I would assume trannies in general don't need GLAD's help.  They take care of their own.  Yeah.  Do we have the actual clip of Neil Patrick Harris?  Yeah.  Fast forward to the end of it.  Let's hear how outrageous this was.  He's got a little...  5,000 volts of static electricity.  Good times. 
[00:32:00]  This would be a...  I gotta find the bullet.  Oh, it's Mr. Science coming in.  Oh, here we go.  Here he goes.  Let me go back to some of the kind of gas it is.  That's what you want to know.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we want to learn today, so...  Times lighter than air.  Is he on helium, this guy?  Go back.  A little more.  So who's on helium right there?  Someone's already on...  That's Science Bob.  And he's already on helium?  He's not.  That's his voice.  That's his regular voice.  Okay, here we go.  Helium tank?  Not quite.  In fact, this is...  Well, you know how helium will make your voice go higher?  I'm sure we've all done that. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, my kids are always sucking on a balloon, and they've talked to me.  Well, this is kind of helium's evil twin.  Oh.  So helium is six times lighter than air, and so sound passes through it differently, and  so it makes the high parts of your voice kind of compressed.  We're okay with that, right?  This is six times heavier than air, and thus, it has the opposite of things to do here.  I'm going to have to fill up a couple balloons here with this.  Probably because it's toxic.  It's going to make us gain weight.  Absolutely not.  What's this?  Really? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, they don't want the kids doing it.  Every lady wants to know...  Look, the balloon goes down.  It's heavy.  What we do is make a little host chat, maybe, but a sulfur hexafluoride version of this.  Sulfur hexafluoride.  Yeah, yeah.  And what is the symbol for that on the chart?  That was...  She's in trouble with how it is.  Sulfur hexafluoride.  That sounds dangerous.  All right, so here's what we're going to do with this.  I love this.  This is good.  This is dangerous?  Okay, here we go. 
[00:33:30]  Fine, fine.  All right, so wait.  Breathe out.  There we go.  And you're going to get the whole thing.  Breathe it in.  There you go.  Whole thing, whole thing.  All right, there they go.  And a little host chat.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, that's weird.  Wow.  Luke, Luke, I am your father.  You don't want to mess with me.  I'm absolutely punished.  Make it to your room.  You're the sick.  Put the lotion in the basket. 
[00:34:00]  Put the lotion in the basket.  That's kind of funny.  Put the...  Okay, we need more.  We need more.  I'm not doing it.  Stop.  We need more.  Give me the next.  Urgent.  We are hooked on it.  By the way, when you're breathing that, you're not getting air.  I have hooked on it.  I sound like Kristen Johnson.  I've never sounded more like a franny in my life.  Okay, okay.  We got more.  We got more.  That was this.  Oh, that's what's going on.  That sucks.  That sucks.  I've never sounded more like a franny.  I don't go for that. 
[00:34:30]  No, that's horseplay.  That's kind of rude.  I like that type of horseplay.  The T word is right.  They should block out that.  It's very offensive.  Those people got to fucking relax, man.  And, you know, good point from Jimmy Newpaltz.  It's funny that Glett accepted his apology and didn't make him do a tour.  That's a great point.  I guess because it was timely or they were heartened.  They were heartened by it.  Heartened.  And the fact that, like, they're not going to take one of their own and really make him,  you know, jump through the hoops, as they say.  The old hair hoop.  See?  That's an asshole.  Oh, I never heard that. 
[00:35:00]  A hair hoop.  A hair hoop.  Jesus.  Jump through the hair hoop.  The old stinky scrunchie.  What the fuck, dude?  Let's go to Anthony in Jersey.  He's going to explain the gas thing for you.  Hit it.  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning.  Let's go.  Hi, Anthony.  Welcome.  Hey.  All right.  So what you basically have is you've got sulfur hexafluoride and you've got bonds as opposed  to helium where they're a lot more spaced apart. 
[00:35:30]  So when you inhale helium, all the bonds are really tight.  They're really packed.  There's a lot more bonds inside there.  So when you're talking, you're vibrating the air molecules.  So for you to actually speak when you have helium, they're vibrating a lot faster because  you're vibrating the air.  They're bouncing back and forth.  Ah, on the molecular level.  Yep.  So then when you breathe in sulfur hexafluoride, the bonds are so far spaced apart, it takes  your voice longer to bounce back and forth between those molecules. 
[00:36:00]  And make them vibrate.  Oh, now that makes perfect sense.  Thank you, sir.  Bullshit.  That's it.  You're welcome.  All right, you geek.  You guys know what he's talking about.  He's guessing.  All right.  That's pretty good.  So.  Yeah, that's ludicrous.  Stop it.  By the way, we did a little sports.  Tiger Woods won for the first time in two years.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't a sanctioned tournament by the PGA.  What, was it just fucking playing alone in his backyard? 
[00:36:30]  He beat some good players, but not the whole gang was playing.  But regardless, did he do well?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, no.  He had a good tournament.  Maybe he just needs a win in his belt now.  Yeah.  Under's belt.  Under his belt.  Yeah, the season's pretty much over, so, you know.  As opposed to a Perkins waitress under his belt.  He's got a few million more now.  That dumb you could tell I had to hand it back over.  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  Did that officially happen?  I think so.  I hope so.  Yeah, so he won.  That was big news in the sports world. 
[00:37:00]  And more big news.  I used to be a Mets fan.  Jose Reyes is gone.  Why?  The Mets sucked so bad last year, and now they don't even have Jose anymore as they go into the  next year.  He signed with the Marlins.  He ain't gonna stick around.  The Mets are in deep fucking financial trouble.  They lost $70 million last year.  Six years, $102 million deal.  How do you lose $70 million?  No one was going to the games because the Mets had a rough year.  That's just it.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable.  Brand new field, too. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Who's gonna go?  Who's gonna go see a Mets game next year without Jose Reyes?  Are you kidding me?  Fun day out at the park.  Isn't he the best player in baseball right now?  Or one of them?  I don't know enough to answer that question.  I just don't fucking care.  I heard he's great.  He's gotta be right up there, sure.  The Mets don't have him anymore.  He's signed with the Marlins for six years.  I'll still go to the games.  I'll go.  Of course you will.  But wow.  Isn't that related to the Bernie Madoff thing?  Yeah, they lost a lot of money.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Didn't they lose a lot of money through the Bernie Madoff?  Yeah.  Shit.  They were invested.  And, yep, more people that got fucked over.  Whoops.  So that's a bummer for the remaining Mets fans.  Good luck.  Keep up your good nature.  Good for you.  And there was that Occupy Wall Street woman.  She's in one of my videos.  She was protesting down there, making sandwiches for the guys and all the protesters down there 
[00:38:30]  and waving signs around.  Her earlier sign said something like, you know, she'll vote after the revolution and Reagan  sucks and things like that.  Reagan.  Is it the one with the glasses?  Yeah.  That's in the paper today?  Yeah.  I filmed her with a sign that said, Reagan sucks balls.  Yeah.  And she also had a sign that said, I support cops that smoke pot.  Yep.  Oh, I remember that.  I've seen that.  Yeah, that's in one of my videos.  Well, that lady.  She realized she was not going.  Is a big star today.  Yeah.  She realized she wasn't going to get anything with that sign. 
[00:39:00]  So she put up another sign that she's a PhD in biomedical science.  Right.  And somebody was walking around, saw that, looked at her resume, and hired her to work  with a Wall Street financial firm.  So she said, all right, fuck this broadcast.  So she immediately went, okay, and dumped the Occupy Wall Street to take a job on Wall Street.  And I would gather, most of those people would do exactly the same, right? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  If you're being offered a nice, cushy job, you're going to take it.  Now, she's not making money hand over fist, as they say now, but she's got the potential  of making a lot of money if she sticks with this and does well.  Do you think at any point when she starts making money that she's going to want to be  taxed up the ass to pay for things that these people were asking for that she was cohorting  with?  Nope.  I don't either.  Nope.  I don't either.  Well, that's in the paper today, huh? 
[00:40:00]  Yep.  Oh, wow.  It's like front and center.  You know how annoying that must be for someone who got, like, laid off, who's been, like,  hitting the pavement?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All she had to do is stand out there with a fucking sign that said pot on it.  Some guy who wanted to fuck her hired her.  Yeah, exactly.  You know.  You know damn well she's going to be getting her hiney pinched.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Pinch that ass.  Yeah.  No surprise there.  Most people would take that gig.  Of course. 
[00:40:30]  Her, is it?  Yeah.  Sam's trying to find her so we could show you the, uh, it's the freak show video I did  for the people that know.  She's the guy with the dumb rat, the bear girl.  I miss bear girl.  I never saw her again.  Well, hopefully she's missing.  Oh.  I don't think I'd go down there anymore.  Zucati Park's pretty much dead.  There's nothing going on.  There she is.  There's the chick.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was the chick.  Watch.  Ronald Reagan sucked balls.  And then, uh, she flipped it over. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, wait.  See, that's the one.  I love cops who squint off.  It's funny.  Some people say, no, no, turn around the other side.  And the other people say, no, no, turn around the other side.  So.  It works.  Either side works for you, right?  Hey, I'm talking here.  Chill out.  This is my interview.  Chill out.  Chill out.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  So she's got a nice job.  She's working on Wall Street.  Yes, with a financial firm.  You know, the enemy. 
[00:41:30]  That makes you happy, right?  It certainly does.  It just shows another part that just shows the hypocrisy of these douchebags.  And, um, the UC Davis clip of the cop, uh, pepper spraying, that line of students that  were, uh, sitting down.  Sure.  I watched the entire, I guess there was about 10 minutes of, uh, video.  There's a longer clip on that?  Chronological order of everything that happened up till the, uh, spraying of the pepper spray.  Which, which I'm going to stop you for a second.  Yeah.  Uh, mainstream media, uh, we're talking CNN, uh, MSNBC, Fox, and you go ABC, NBC, CBS, all 
[00:42:00]  of them, they all probably could have done what you just did.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  Easily, easily.  Just wanted to make that perfectly clear to the people out there.  The video started out with, um, some demonstrators, uh, standing around, a bunch of cops, uh, in  a field saying, you have to move.  You have to leave.  This isn't allowed.  It's not a legal gathering or whatever.  Whatever the case may be.  Uh, the people started circling the cops, encircling them. 
[00:42:30]  And, uh, the cops started arresting people.  They arrested, um, I guess, uh, maybe 15 people or so, put them in a truck, and then  the students surrounded the cops, the vehicles, and blocked their way, and said, you, we're  not letting, my check, my check, my check, my check.  We are not letting you leave until you free our brothers and sisters that have been arrested.  And the cops are like, no, we're leaving.  And again, five more times, the cops went up to who they perceived as some type of leadership 
[00:43:00]  in this organization, and told them, look, you have to move, or you will be arrested.  We are going to use certain avenues to, to get you to move.  They blocked the cops in.  They locked arms and put a circle around all the officers so they couldn't physically leave  without grabbing these students in some way, shape, or form, and physically moving them  out of the way.  Uh, after numerous warnings, uh, and, and threats that they were, uh, uh, not going to let these 
[00:43:30]  cops leave the area, uh, they started shaking up the pepper spray cans, telling them what  was going to happen.  Uh, the protesters knew it was coming.  They, they said, cover your mouth, cover your eyes, but didn't move.  And then they got pepper sprayed.  Oh, okay.  So they were surrounding the cops at that moment.  Yeah.  The cops were surrounded without a way to leave and take these, um, uh, uh, prisoners, uh,  with them.  But more importantly, it needs to be noted, uh, the media must've had the long clip, but 
[00:44:00]  chose that it was a much better fucking picture to just show the cops, uh, pepper spraying  what looks like a peaceful protest.  Right.  They're just sitting down.  Well, is it the same angle?  Is it the same video?  No, it's, it's all in chronological order from different video, but you could tell it's,  it's actually what happened.  And there's some, there's some, um, you think the media on there that lets you know what's  going on too.  To be fair, you think the media had this whole thing before they just chose to go with the  one moment? 
[00:44:30]  I don't know.  Fox would have showed this.  Fox would have taken the side of the cops.  Yeah.  That's what I'm wondering.  Yeah.  Are they going to show it today?  Set them free.  Okay.  Are they going to show it today now that the full story's out there?  I would hope so.  That's a question.  I doubt it.  Like set them free.  They're yelling.  And then, let's march peacefully.  Let's march peacefully.  As one.  As one.  Towards what?  They're being held.  Towards what?  They're being held.  Weird, dummy.  The guy must have a hair lip.  So now they're going to get up and march to where the arrested people, and they're yelling, 
[00:45:00]  set them free.  And then they surround the cops and the vehicle with the prisoners in it.  Set them free.  Set them free.  And they're like, look, get the fuck up or we're going to spray you.  Set them free.  Set them free.  Set them free.  They're not right.  This goes on and on.  These stupid little fat cats.  Set them free.  There's no passion to these people.  What is that?  Burberry she's wearing there?  What is that?  Yeah, it looks like Burberry.  What is that?  No, something sport. 
[00:45:30]  Remember the something sport is?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  Jan sport.  Jan sport.  Ah, yes, yes.  All nice stuff.  Jan sport's all right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, thanks for that, Ant.  There you go.  There's the real story.  And they were given so many warnings.  And you can see they're surrounded.  There's an entire perimeter around these cops who are standing in the middle saying, all right,  should we just plow through them, grab a few, and toss them to the side? 
[00:46:00]  You know, they're like, you've got to get up.  You've got to move.  Yeah.  Cops telling them, right?  How annoyed do you think these cops are right now just waiting?  Oh, I know.  Just crack their heads open.  I didn't realize that they were physically surrounding them.  See, you're right.  That does make a huge difference.  Yeah.  And they were patient.  I mean, they sat there.  And then even the spraying, in the wrong context, it looks like the cop is so just, hey, here's  a little pepper spray for your faces.  But he didn't want it to look like, like, I'm in here.  Fuck you. 
[00:46:30]  You know, taking combat stance and spraying it.  It's like, look, you've been warned probably seven times.  Here it is.  All right.  Now what?  Wow.  That's really great.  Well, let's see if mainstream media does a whole piece on this now that the whole story  is out there.  Children?  They're calling themselves children?  Yeah.  They're like, don't shoot the children.  I fucking hate them.  I know.  All right.  Oh, boy.  And there was a problem.  Washington, I guess, D.C. had their Occupy D.C. thing going on.  And the cops were kicking their asses out of there and got into a little scuffle. 
[00:47:00]  Few arrests.  They were trying to tear down some structure that the protesters made so they could have  heat.  Mm-hmm.  And cops ripped that down.  Hit the road.  Hit the bricks.  Is any of the Occupy's holding strong?  Eh, I'm sure there's a few here and there, but nothing like it was.  Most of the main cities have gone away.  It's a footnote.  Although they've moved indoors.  It's a footnote. 
[00:47:30]  They've moved indoors.  His office is being used down near Wall Street.  It's so funny because they don't know what to do.  They're like, eh, like when Obama was here, he's staying at the Sheridan in the city.  They were all like, yeah, let's run there.  And they all run there to protest.  It's like, oh, there's something going on at the U.N.  Whoa.  They all run down there.  They're just running to get mommy and daddy to notice them.  Shut up.  Creeps.  You don't think they're sincere?  No.  They're dunces.  All right.  We should take a break. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, there he is.  Hi, Kenny.  We got the Herman Cain shit this weekend.  It was terrific.  He rules.  He fucking rules.  That guy is out of his bird.  I love it.  He's terrific.  Plan B, motherfuckers.  And we were just talking about the gay.  Nigeria.  Wait till you hear what they want to do with the gay.  I called it something different growing up.  Wait till you hear what they want to do.  Give somebody $10 million if they send them $1,000?  Look, we think you should be able to...  Those Nigerians. 
[00:48:30]  We think you should be able to say tranny in a comical form, obviously, when you're trying  to tell a joke, especially.  Yeah.  But then you get this.  This is just ridiculous.  Just taking it to a new level of hatred.  Of course.  Of course.  We'll explain next.  This is the O.P.N. Anthony Show.  Serious.  Next time.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this when it's told.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  Or else it gets the hose.  And when it's done, there's one more thing.  A simple little task. 
[00:49:00]  It's put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Put the fucking lotion in the basket.  All these stupid women are the same.  Helps me not to think of them as human.  So I call them it instead of by their names.  Mister, please no more abuse.  Can't you see there's no excuse?  My family's probably wondering where I've been. 
[00:49:30]  They'll starve you so your skin gets loose.  Stop crying now, you big fat moose.  Just put the fucking lotion on your skin.  And then put the fucking lotion in the basket.  Your chances for survival are remote.  I'm impervious to all your silly whining.  So write down before I jam a moth.  Write down your fucking throat. 
[00:50:00]  Mister, please, my mom's got money.  Let me go, this isn't funny.  Cops are sure to send somebody.  Turn me loose, don't be a dummy.  Listen to your scream and wail.  Keep it down, you fucking wail.  Mind the broken fingernail.  The last girl climbed halfway but failed.  Precious? 
[00:50:30]  She's down here, you piece of shit.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  I'd kill you but there's someone at the door.  Don't make me go and get my gun and shoot you.  It's a waste of skin.  They don't sell fat girls in a fucking store.  Put my fucking precious in the basket.  Don't you hurt my one and only friend. 
[00:51:00]  You don't know what pain is but I'll teach you.  If you lay a fucking finger on my poodle's pretty head.  Put the fucking poodle in the basket.  Good morning, thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny, how can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through, you know, the air, satellite. 
[00:51:30]  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi, whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really, this is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this but, like, I mean, did you get into your router settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, exactly, right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah, why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works.  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean, like a Cat5?  You're talking about a, you know, Ethernet kit?  Yeah, they call them, I think they call them hot wires.  Firewire?  Firewire.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just, let me just get back to work, man. 
[00:52:30]  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now.  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Jeez.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that it?  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude. 
[00:53:00]  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no.  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No, if you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends, 5,000.  I'm not helping with Facebook.  I think somebody set up a fan page.  I'm hanging up.  How do I get people to go there instead of sending me friend requests?  You know him as Vinny's lovable uncle from MTV's Jersey Shore.  Oh, what the fuck?  Now the Sicilian funny man brings his act straight off the boat and on to Broadway.  Listen, I gotta say something. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Let me fucking talk.  Uncle Nino presents Bad Jokes and Wine.  I've been drinking all fucking week.  We're making toast to the crack that never heals.  The more you rub it, the better it feels.  You can scrub it from me to hell.  You never get rid of that fishy smell.  You're fucking for me.  You're fucking for me.  Come see what nobody else will as the stereotypical Italian recites line after line of adolescent  toilet humor.  First time I had sex, I was so scared.  I was all by myself.  I says, I was with this girl.  I says, honey, is it in?  She says, yes. 
[00:54:00]  Well, start walking towards me now.  Oh.  I ask this guy.  I says, buddy, did you ever see the numbers on the condoms?  He says, what numbers?  So I guess you don't have to roll the back now for you.  Why?  Oh.  Never before has an offensive cartoonish caricature told so many bad jokes in one hour, writes  the Daily News.  Oh, wait.  What do you call?  What do you call a fact?  Hey, Chuck.  What the fuck?  How come only brothers could play basketball?  Because you got to know how to steal, run, and shoot.  Yeah, he's insulting.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  I laughed once, then wondered why I had, said the New York Post. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I have to say one last thing.  I'll shut up.  I promise I'll shut up.  I got it.  Listen, I love black women.  I always take a shot in the dark.  And when asked, the New York Times said they didn't bother to show up and review it.  I was with this girl.  I says, miss, did you ever have a 16-second orgasm?  She says, no.  She says, you got a fucking minute?  What the fuck?  It's Uncle Nino's Bad Jokes and Wine.  Hey, God bless everybody.  Who gives a fuck?  Live on Broadway for as long as people still give a shit about the Jersey Shore. 
[00:55:00]  What the fuck?  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good girl, let me smile.  Good girl, let me smile. 
[00:55:30]  Good girl, let me smile.  When you're rockin' and a-rollin'  Can't hear your mama call  From the early, early morning to the early, early night  When I call Miss Molly rockin' at the house of blue light  Good girl, let me smile.  So like to fall  When you're rockin' and a-rollin'  Can't hear your mama call  Mama, papa told me, son, you better watch yourself 
[00:56:00]  If the new promise, mama had to watch my papa sell  Good golly, Miss Molly  So let the ball  When you're rocking and rolling  Can't hear your mama call  Getting topical  Hold up, wait a minute  With the sex man  Sexy, what do we got today?  Good morning  Good morning, sexy  Well, today, little Richard is 79 
[00:56:30]  79 years old  79 years young, I would say  Is he still living in that hotel?  Really?  Wasn't it the Hyatt on Sunset?  I don't know  We would go out there every once in a while for radio  And he had like the whole penthouse or something  Yeah  And we would see him coming and going from time to time  He couldn't just live there  Does he still have that kind of money to fucking just live in a hotel penthouse?  I don't know, man  Howard Hughes?  I remember back in the day, we definitely saw Little Richard 
[00:57:00]  And it was told to us that he was living in the Hyatt on Sunset  Huh  E-Rock, you put together the Patrice thing  Yes  With the help of the boys at E-Rock  Yeah, you're getting praise, my friend  You're getting praise  I'm getting used to it  A lot of people enjoyed the Patrice special  I personally could not fucking listen whatsoever  I didn't hear it  I heard Kenny put some on when we were on the road  And I just couldn't hear it  You couldn't, right?  No  It's rough  Yeah, you need a little time going by  But I want to acknowledge that E-Rock put together a hell of a special 
[00:57:30]  He certainly did  Thank you  But what you gonna do for me today?  Today, mother  I just want to get past the Patrice thing  Whatever way that is  Yep, today at the services  This afternoon  Yeah, that's  Yep  I hate these things  No one likes them 
[00:58:00]  But I really, really detest them  Everyone does  They're unpleasant  Yeah  They really are unpleasant  I figure it's like, you know, for the family  Right  Huh?  For the family, I figure, you know  That's what you're doing it for  Oh, of course, of course  You're doing it for me  I hate that  Even when it's my family  I don't like shit like this  It's just like  No one likes it, though  Yeah, no one enjoys it  No one's like, oh, what time's the way?  Fuck, yes  Right  I don't know  I think some people do  Huh?  I think there are some people that do  Enjoy it 
[00:58:30]  Well, yeah  Maybe old people  Yeah, old people  I think old people get death  Because by the time they're old  They've seen so many people go  I know  Just the fact that it's happening  Like, tells you somebody enjoys it  Just the fact that people do it  I think it's  It's like, oh, we gotta have this and this and this  How about nothing?  How about a picture?  I think it's closure  With some fucking music playing  It is closure  No, it's about  People are, like, ritualistic 
[00:59:00]  And how do you, like  Death is the end of it  It's the one thing we'll never conquer  How do you get beyond it?  And this is how we get beyond it  It's like a weird way of saying goodbye  And putting it to bed  Yeah, it's just a way we get moving  It's a necessity  Huh  It's not about being fun  Or being maudlin or morbid  It's literally about, I think, nature  Because we're aware of our own mortality  Even chimps are, to a certain degree  Like, they all stare at the body  And the, uh  Yeah  You know, they get it  So I think it's our way of getting beyond our own fucking mortality  It's a weird, necessary ritual 
[00:59:30]  Open casket or closed casket?  I think closed  I would hope closed  I usually like closed  No, it is closed  Oh, it is?  I would hope it's closed  It was gonna be open for a while  What?  Now it's closed  I don't like open  It should always be closed, I think, yeah  Yeah  Open casket is a little morbid  That's old school  Yeah  That's fucking old school shit  When our pal Gavin died last year  Right around now  My brother, uh, Brett's best friend  You know, the owner of FH Riley's  And, uh, he pretty much grew up with us, uh, Gavin  And, uh, they went open casket about this time last year 
[01:00:00]  Aye  He was only 41  Gavin?  It was rough, man  Yeah  That open casket is rough  Old person open casket on mine  They look the same  Well, yeah, that's true  Morbid curiosity, I guess  But when they're young  That's true  Fuck  Fuck  I never look  Huh?  I don't look  You don't go up?  Nope  It's hard  I don't go up  I don't even look  From the back of the room  I won't even turn to the front of the room to look  Really?  I avert my eyes  Are you scared you're gonna cry?  No, I just don't 
[01:00:30]  I don't wanna be  I don't wanna be, uh, uh  That close to death  Have that memory  No, I don't wanna have the memory of that person like that  Yeah  I like having the memory of the person alive  And fucking, you know  When you saw him last  Yeah  This ain't a makeup for, you know  Oh, well, I should've seen him, like, last week  Instead of last month  Now let me see him today  Oh, that's right  He's dead  Yeah  Uh  I hate that  It's creepy  You know why I go up?  Why?  Curiosity  See, I can't  Curiosity can't transcend fucking morbid  I know the person's not there 
[01:01:00]  And I know there's nothing I can say up there at the casket  It's just like  I go up for curiosity  Like, oh, that's how he looks now  You know  I remember years ago  Like, uh  Going to my grandfather's funeral  And everybody kind of shuffles past  And you do a little kneel thing  In front of the casket  And you put your hands together  Like you're a little praying thing  And then, you know  I was supposed to do that  So I did it  And, like, it's such a  It's such a farce  Because I was supposed to be praying, I guess 
[01:01:30]  And all I could do  Is sit  Kneel there with my hands  In prayer fashion  Going, oh my god  Get me away from here  This is so creepy  How long do I have to stay here  Before it looks like  You know  So it looks like I was actually praying  I'm not praying  Oh god, I hate  Look at his face  Oh shit, if he opens his eyes  I'm gonna freak out  You're saying  What pretty much everyone does  Yeah  Yeah  You are  It's creepy  It's like, okay  I count to, like  How do you count?  Slowly  1-100  2-100  3-100  So 
[01:02:00]  But today's the day  And then  That's creepy  I think tomorrow becomes something  A little different  You know  Yeah  And then you just kind of  You kind of just  Let the old days  Pile up behind you  Yeah  And hope it gets better  That's it  That's how it works  It does  You know  It does  It is  It is what it is  Yeah  I mean  Within 50 years  We'll all be in the box  You know  Within 50 fucking years  50, I'll take 50  But you know what I'm saying  Like that's how  It's not like 
[01:02:30]  Wow, we're gonna miss him  For 10,000 years  10,000 years  We're here for 100  He left in 40  He should have left in 90  We'll leave in 30 more  It's like that brief  Yeah, yeah  It stinks  But, you know  I was watching a documentary  About these cave paintings  And there was handprints  On the walls  And they're going  Yeah, this is  30,000 years old  These, you know  Cro-Magnon men  Were painting horses  And tigers 
[01:03:00]  And stuff like that  And then the guy  Just put his handprint  Up on the wall  And it's like  That's fucking  30,000 years ago  And it was just an asshole  That didn't have  Any artistic ability  So he said  Fuck  It's a turkey  Yeah  And it was just  It's like  Fuck, man  That seems like  A really long time ago  But that isn't really  Even a long time ago  But in our lifetime  That's huge  That's like fucking  Sure  15 times Jesus 
[01:03:30]  Age  But for the universe  2,000 years ago  That's barely a blink  That's nothing  Not even a blink  30,000 years  Doesn't register  But 30,000 years  And then, yeah  You realize  Alright  Meh  Got our limited time here  Don't we  Well, yeah  Patrice reminds us  All of that  That's the  You know  It's the mortality thing  Hits everyone hard  When someone young dies  And then what do you do  Fuck  It makes it  The thing that makes it  A little bit easier for me  Is  Knowing that  Had he lived 
[01:04:00]  You know  It's a stroke  It's like for a while  It's a touch and go  Had he pulled through  Or had he been able  To pull through  He would have been  In a terrible  Terrible situation  And it never would have  Gotten better  Never  Or if it did  It would have been  Literally 1%  Like  I was wanting him to die  Because I wanted him  To be free  I want my friend  To not  Sit and be in this  Horrible, horrible place  Yeah  And it made it  A little bit easier  To see it as like  Thank fucking god man  I'm not gonna have to  Think of him 
[01:04:30]  For the next 5 years  Like oh god  Is he itchy  Is he feel  Years  I would literally  For a month  Every night  I would just be  Panic stricken  Thinking does he have  An itch he can't scratch  Is he  Does his tube hurt  Like you can't stop  Thinking of that  It's all consuming  Everything you do  You're thinking of it  Yeah  And so I'm relieved  That he's not gonna  Have to be in that  Kind of horrible  Horrible pain  Or that frustration  And he would have  Wanted that  Of course  I think so  There's not even  A doubt in anyone's  Mind  I believe so  Yeah  So it makes it 
[01:05:00]  Slightly easier  Than just a guy  Hit by a drunk driver  Right  Right  Yeah  Yeah  That's  Hey  Iraq  A lot of questions  About the weekend  The Patrice tribute  On audible  No  We didn't  Will it be  Iraq  We're gonna try  To work something out  Yeah cause we  See get it  Lighten the mood  Yes  Theoretically  We could  I mean why  Right  We could  But I  Will they take it  That large  That's the thing  We could do it  That's a good question  You can fucking  Take it that large  Like that file  Yeah 
[01:05:30]  You better take it  Fuck yeah  Sit on that file  Alright cause a lot of  People wanna know  Well we're trying to  There's two things  Number one is  You know  Just letting them know  This is a special thing  Separate from the show  And number two  It'd be nice  If we could figure out  A way to get  The money to the family  From the special  The money  That would be nice  Good luck fucking  Dealing with that  With the lawyers  Around here  Complicates things  They might allow it  We officially haven't asked  But we will  But I just  I would assume  That there will be  Some kind of issue  With it  It's you 
[01:06:00]  But we'll see  Those are the only  Oh my god  But audible  Should be able to  Pop it up there  No problem  Oh yeah  I mean  It's just a matter of us  Sending it to them  So it's so easy  But it's just  You know  Making sure it's done  All right we'll figure it out  Because a lot of people  Are asking  Because they didn't  Hear the whole thing  It was like 16 hours  Of material  Wow  Yeah  That's a lot  16 hours  And we have another  Five for tomorrow  Right  Yeah we  There was a lot  That we couldn't  Even fit into that  Yeah  So tomorrow  We'll be doing  I guess volume two  Of tribute to Patrice

[01:17:00]  Behind the camera  Was he saying anything  The husband  I don't remember  Maybe like he  I think at one point  Oh this is my favorite  At one point she's crawling  She's blowing the guy  And uh  And the husband says  Uh  Like you know  Alright now get up on the bed  So she does  And he goes  Now get in breeding position  Breeding position  Get in breeding position  Oh it was so dirty  What was breeding position  Hands and knees  Ready to take it  Hands and knees  That was so fucking rude  Did uh  The brother slip  Or uh  Slip of the big one  Yeah but he was  He wasn't unreasonable  With his penis  Like I think he knew 
[01:17:30]  That his penis  Was more than the average  Fucking human can handle  So like  He was giving it to her  But he wasn't like  He wasn't trying  You could see  He wasn't trying to hurt her  He was just  Pounded balls deep  Yeah  Like that horse video  Yeah  Although I did see one like that too  Lady in the kitchen being fucked  Yeah  And the husband kept encouraging  The guy to like  Go deeper  What is  I don't know  What is the thing there  It's hot to watch  And pornographic  I don't think I could do it  But it's fun to watch  Don't think I could do it  You have to put the word  Think in there  Sure I'm a pervert dude  Yeah but that's beyond pervert

[01:19:30]  Mickey and Amelia  In Baltimore  But they were  It's one of the most fun  Honestly  One of the most fun  Terrestrial shows  I've done in years  I wonder why we hold them  We just got a bad show  Or whatever  I don't remember though  But I made fun of Sandusky  And there's a Jerry Sandusky  Working there  As a sportscaster  In Boston  I'm sorry  In Baltimore  But he spells it with a G  But he's been getting  Hey man  Wow  I bet  Oh that's gotta suck  Jerry Sandusky  I'm sure he doesn't want  To change his name  He's been developing that name  For years probably  Yeah  Oh that blows  Yeah  Where was Sandusky

[01:20:30]  Sentenced three years ago already  Three years  Is that possible  Yeah  Sentenced 33 years in prison  For armed robbery  Three years ago  That went down  Has he been in prison  For three years already  Fucking OJ  Really screwed the pooch  On that one  Didn't he  Dude you got away with it  I know  He got away with it  You got away  You fucking  Almost cut her head off  And you're fucking  Still walking around  Banging blondes  You dummy  And he had to  Fucking hold up  Some people  What an idiot  Oh what a stupid  Asshole 
[01:21:00]  You skated  And he'll do a lot  Of those 33 years man  He has to do 11  I think  Am I wrong  Well he's done  Three already I guess  Two years already  By the time he gets out though  How old is he  How old is fucking OJ  45  He's a lot older than that  He's gotta be at least  Perhaps more than that  I'm gonna go  63  He'll be  70  Okay I made me wrong  I'm gonna go 63  The answer  Yeah  Is 64  Wow  When's his birthday though  Uh 
[01:21:30]  July  So he's 63  He'll be 64 in July  No he'll be 65 in July  Damn it  So he's  64 is the answer  To the question  He's 64  If he gets out  In whatever  10 years  You know  74  73  He's gonna  Just gonna be  A disaster  Yeah  And he got away  With it too  Man  We haven't heard  Any stories  About OJ  In prison  Like there hasn't  Been any news  What's he doing  I don't know  Does he just sit around  Or is he active  In prison  Killing people 
[01:22:00]  What does he do  Is he working out  Is he working  In a license plate factory  I bet you he's jovial  Yeah  You think he's a pleasant guy  Yeah  Hello  He's laughing a lot  They probably like him in jail  He's OJ  He's OJ  Killed white people  They gotta love him  Murder  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah they gotta love him  He really  Really did  Do bad things  Wee wee  How annoying would it be  If I just  Developed a fucking  R list  That'd be fun for everyone 
[01:22:30]  Why not  This old  This thing in February  From the Daily Mail  So it says  That he was  Ah yeah  That was a rumor  Yeah  We don't know if that was true  Anything in the Daily Mail  Yeah we don't know if that was true  Lying  Limey papers  They're all full of shit  Assholes  Whenever you get a headline  That says you know  UFO lands  Spacemen get out  And greet people  And then you go  Alright let me read that  Click  And it's the Daily Mail  And it's like 
[01:23:00]  Oh  This is a scenario  That could happen  If spacemen come down here  Oh really  Is that how you tease me  You get three paragraphs in  And it says  It was a racial  Attack  It was a skinhead  He spent three weeks  In the hospital  Said the National Enquirer  So this is their source  Come on  The Enquirer is actually  A pretty good source though  Yeah they've  Been right a lot  Yeah they're wrong a lot  But they're also right a lot  Yeah  And they're trying to be  More right than wrong  These days  They're trying to get  A little more respect  They've been sued 
[01:23:30]  Yeah  They've lost a few lawsuits  Yeah  And our newspapers  Are any better  Well you know what  They stink  But yeah  They're better  They are better  Than the Daily Mail  The answer to that question  Is yeah  They are better  They just print lies  In the Daily Mail  That are like blatant  Like I could read through  The lies in our paper  Oh  OJ update  News 1 for Black America  Says  OJ Simpson is bored  Out of his mind  Bored out of his mind  Oh poor guy  That's gotta suck 
[01:24:00]  What do you do  Exactly  Especially if you don't know  How to read  Wow  33  Funny  All right  Good  Oh  Okay  No we don't need  OJ's verdict  Everyone has heard that  A million times  Why does he just talk to me  Iraq  We talk to everybody  Stop talking to me  He's told you 50 times  Just talk to everybody  Just talk to everybody  What did you say  People know you now  I have his 2008 verdict  We don't need it  Okay  Don't reference me again  Anthony 
[01:24:30]  Oh  Edgar  Don't reference me  He referenced you  An hour ago  Edgar  Edgar  I like it  Anthony  Anthony  What is that  It's dry  Oppy nose  Oppy  Oppy  You guys wanna  You guys wanna learn  About Nigeria  I think I can figure it out  But  Yes  See we're  We're reasonable people  We think Neil Patrick Howard  Certainly should be able  To say tranny  On network TV  We're reasonable men  And then of course 
[01:25:00]  We completely disagree  With this  This horse shit  Nigeria wants to ban  Homosexuality  Punishable by 14 years  14 years  In the areas  In Nigeria's north  Where Islamic  Sharia law  Has been forced  For about a decade  Gays and lesbians  Can face death  By stoning  Under the proposed law  Passed by  Senate this week  Couples who marry  Could face up to  14 years  Each in prison  Witnesses  Or anyone  Who helps  Couples 
[01:25:30]  Marry  Could be sentenced  To 10 years  Behind bars  So this is  The gays  That get married  Right  Yup  The bill also  Punishes  The public  Show of  Same sex  Amorous  Relationships  Directly or  Indirectly  With 10 years  In prison  So holding hands  Or kissing  Or a little peck  On your boyfriend's  Mouth  Or a blowjob  Or a blowjob  In public  Will get you  10 years  Well Sharia law  Is reasonable though  I mean  All the religions  Are the same  And it's good  Sharia law  Is a great thing  Oh yeah 
[01:26:00]  It's great  It's a great  They treat women  Well  They treat gays  Well  It's wonderful  Sure  Wonderful  Wonderful way to live  The bill must be passed  By Nigeria's  House of Representatives  And signed by  President Jonathan  Before becoming law  You just know  That's all corrupt  And like  Like they talk about  Yeah it's got to  Sign into law  It's got to  Pass Congress  And such horse shit  You think it'll be passed?  I don't know  How much money  Is trading hands  Nigeria  If it's Sharia law  Of course  Well that's only part  Of Nigeria right?  They're saying  That's probably 
[01:26:30]  A pretty fucking strong  Little arm of that  Did you know that?  What?  That they had  Sharia law?  I didn't know  In North Nigeria?  I thought it was  Just pandemonium  And fucking chaos  Over there  Just everywhere?  I didn't even know  They had some pseudo-government  If people are fucking in jail  Do their prison sentence  Get extended?  Oh that's good  Oh jeez Sam  Kill a guy in jail  Do an expose  Get your ass over there  In prison  I'm not going to  See what happens  Go undercover  Go deep undercover  Yeah  I just learned  Sam's got some  Sick fantasies  Breathing  Is that a fantasy  But it's a good question  What's up with that?  What's a Nigerian 
[01:27:00]  Armed robber  To kiss his back  At his razor bumps  And sodomize him  I'll kiss them  Bumps away for you  Baby boy  I'm doing better  With my bumps  You're not doing better  Yes I am  Face is very red  I know  Because I had to  Put lotion on  That irritates the skin  At first  And then we'll  Bring it back down  Why did it  Irritate the skin?  Because it softens  The skin  And that way  The hair will be able to  What kind of lotion  Is it called  The after show lotion?  Irritates everything  You use a razor  With just one blade  One blade now 
[01:27:30]  Why?  It's much better  Try it on your wrist  Anytime I've used  A one bladed razor  It's terrible  The shave is not  Nearly as close  It's not a good shave  But in terms of bumps  It's much better  So you'd rather have  The Fred Flintstone look  With the perpetual  Five o'clock shadow  Than the bumps  Yeah  White guys don't get bumps  Sam  No they don't  They don't  My hair is coarse  You gotta be part black  There's so much black in you  Yeah  You are so negro  Bump bump bump 
[01:28:00]  The razors that I use  Are specifically  I mean they're black people  Black people  On the razor  And they use some cream  For black people  Yeah  It's like black people cream  Yeah  They change  I think  I used to use  An after shave thing  That was called  Bump patrol  That used to have  Black people  I love them guys  I listened to them  In the 90s  The bump patrol  They're good  They used to have  Black people on the box  But I think now  Then they started diversifying  Which I don't like  And put like white people  You need black people  On the box 
[01:28:30]  So you know it works  That's bullshit  It's like  You know  Embrace the community  Yeah yeah yeah  You know  That's good  Alright  But it's getting better  Wait till you see  I'd like to slap them off  I wish that was my solution  Just to keep slapping  Sam's bumps  Until they fall off  Yeah until they fall off  Like fucking those little  Candies that come on the paper  And you scrape them off  Your teeth  Dots  Yeah dots  It'll work  I would do that  We're gonna break  We got Jota Rose  And Bill Burr  Probably next  Then we got  John Jones at 830  Chris Rock at 9 o'clock  930

[01:39:00]  Like ours are cut up  In nice small little states  They didn't know where to stop  How come there's no white stuff  Falling there in July  I don't want to go there  That looks like things  Actually grow  The bums  I didn't realize  Minnesota was that  Much further north  Than like Buffalo  And Buffalo  Is cold as balls  You know what  I gotta be honest  Holy shit  I didn't know  It was that north  I didn't know where it was  I'm terrible at geography  I didn't know it was that far north  I would have moved Minnesota  A little east of what it is now 
[01:39:30]  Really  That's where I thought it was  I thought it was a little  Further east than that  A little south  A little south  And I would have went  A little south  A little south  If we're gonna be honest  With you guys  I would have went a little south  I would have said  It was like  Kind of parallel to Buffalo  Maybe just north of Buffalo  Everyone knows  Slightly north of Buffalo  It's freezing  It's further north than Maine  I know  It's way the fuck up there  The club I'm at  Is inside the Mall of America  Is that mall cool?  Well look  It's big  Yeah 
[01:40:00]  As far as malls goes  It's great  I would never tell somebody  Like you gotta go  You gotta make a point in your life  To go to the Mall of America  It's a mall  Because it has the same shit  Every other mall has  It's just a lot bigger  Just gigantic  And there's a roller coaster  I think  In the mall?  I think so  Yeah  Inside  Ice skating right too  I think  Yeah  There's a bunch of activities  Underneath their roof  Because it gets very cold there  And people are able to go to this mall  And kind of  You know  Be warm  Yeah it's like a great  It's like a dream  To me at least  It's like a dream road gig  Because you can 
[01:40:30]  You have something  You can go to the mall  And like walk around  And not feel like fucking lonely  Yeah  I'm sorry  I'm just laughing at  What is that?  What is a Hulk  It's not there anymore  But the Mall of America  Was once home  To Hulk Hogan's  Pasta Mania  Oh Jesus  Everything after  Mania  It's just pasta  Pasta Mania  So his restaurant business  Failed too  Oh Pasta Mania  Like Hulkamania  Pasta Mania  Brother  What terrible is that?

Linda Hogan  Sorry  Oh okay  I'm there going  Wait a minute  When did that happen?  70%  She got 70%  This guy just sent me the article  There's no fucking way  To actually  Do the math there  How does she  Get that much money?  It says  So much for 50-50  Linda received more than  70% of the couple's  Liquid assets  But the pain doesn't stop there  For the Hulkster  His ex also received  A 40% ownership stake 
[01:49:00]  In Hulk's companies  Plus she receives  A $3 million  Property settlement  Oh  How does he not kill her?  Fucking ridiculous  What did she do to earn that?  Nothing  She spread her legs  Like a fucking whore  But he must have had  A shitty lawyer  He got to fuck  Sounds like he  Tapped out  Sounds like he said  Look I just want it  To be over brother  Yeah  I know guys get fucked  In divorce cases  But he must have  Had a shitty lawyer  On top  He hired Colin Ferguson  That would be great  What a lawyer  She got a lump sum 
[01:49:30]  Of $7.44 million  From the couple's  Investment account  The remaining $2.97  So listen to this  She got $7.44  Of the investment accounts  And he got $2.97  How is that fucking  Possible?  That isn't even  He made all that money  Ridiculous  You know what's great  Is to bring shit up  Like that while you're  Doing stand up  And as you're doing it  You hear the women  In the crowd go  That's right  Oh yeah  That's right  I mean don't ever do it  Because the hatred  You'll have for women  Will go through

[01:53:00]  They just want to  They just want to run  Their fucking mouths  And they're lippy  And I don't like it  I think they need to  Learn their place  I gotta say  I saw  Both you guys at Carnegie  It was obviously  Bill Burr's show  But Joe  You're fucking killed  And speaking of  Women aging  Bill Burr's material  On plastic surgery  Holy fuck  Did that have  I was howling  Oh thanks  I don't want you to do it  I'm just giving you  A compliment  Well I could never  Follow Joe's  Yeah  Your fucking  Your new shit

[01:54:30]  I went to  I went to one at midnight  I hate how you already knew  What you were going to say  And you didn't listen  To the rest of that  Wait you didn't listen  To a word  Turned out completely  You did Black Friday Joe  I went at midnight  Like Thanksgiving night  Oh my god  I came to look at you  Why  I had nothing to do  So you went to Walmart  I went to the Joe Jeans outlet  I got a bunch of pairs of Joe Jeans  For like 60 bucks each  You couldn't fucking beat it  You're in show business Joe  I'm not at the level  Where I get free shit yet  But I wouldn't have money  You could have got those jeans 
[01:55:00]  On Tuesday  I think Bill Burr's right  When Joe becomes an icon  He'll be one of those people  Who goes in for the voiceover  And is stealing mints  You tight fuck  Is Joe a chiseler  Totally  No no no no  Joe thinks it's all gonna go away  At any second  I'm not a chiseler  But I do enjoy a deal  I'm not gonna lie  I'm not gonna lie  When I find one  I won't bargain hunt  But if I find one  I get genuinely excited  Did you fight the crowds  For your jeans  Kansas City  No it was empty  But you had to go at midnight 
[01:55:30]  Dude I was literally  Sitting on my mom and dad's couch  At midnight on Thanksgiving  I was wired  I had nothing to do  And they lived by these outlets  I was like I'm just gonna go over  And see what it's all about  And I went over  He planned his entire fucking visit  For his parents  Around this goddamn sale  He's trying to make it  Sound logical  You couldn't wait  I was wired  When I'm wired at 12  You know  I'll jerk off  I'll make a sandwich  I'll make a sandwich  Not go to the store  Yeah  Holy shit  John Jones is making his way  Down the hall  He's here early  What?  John Jones man  He's the UFC champion 
[01:56:00]  He's the fucking man  These days  Yeah  But you gotta get Joe  In the seat  He's early  Do we have to break  For live reads  Or are we good?

[01:56:30]  Did you ever listen  To your own act?  Oh hey  Joey DeRose  Joey DeRose  Joe to you  Hi Joe  I want to see if that mic's on  Joe  Were you talking to that real fast?  Oh sorry  Yes  Hello  Okay I got you  Is it on?  Holy shit  John Jones in the studio  Yeah  How you doing?  Pleasure  It's a pleasure to meet you sir  He's in fighting shape  Opie and Anthony  What's up man?  Fuck that  John Jones man  Uh uh  We became instant fans of yours 
[01:57:00]  Instant  Which fight was it?  Shogun fight?  Uh which one was it?  Uh  It was before Shogun  It was before Shogun  And we wound in here badly  I was at the Shogun fight  That was  In the jersey  I was sitting behind his family  Uh it was really  Poor guy  Yeah they were not happy  Ah shit  These tough Brazilian guys  Who were like part of his crew  And his family  And they were weeping  Like there was  Wow really?  I couldn't believe you  Yeah cause he really beat up Shogun  Yeah yeah  Um  It was funny  I was actually nervous  To go to Brazil  Because of that 
[01:57:30]  You know he's like a hero  Over there  You know like an icon  I was like I don't know  If I'm quite welcome there yet  Oh man  Beat up there Elvis  Pretty much  Yeah  Yeah  It wasn't even a close fight  Like maybe for the first few minutes  Of the first round  But I watched it again yesterday  Oh  Humiliating  Humiliating  To lose your belt like that  Like if you lose your belt  You want it to go out maybe  In the fifth round  Not like that  We're not talking about losing belts  Dude  Alright yeah  You're fighting next week  I'm sure you'll be fine  Rashida  Yeah  Yeah I'm excited man 
[01:58:00]  Lioto's a tough  Tough dude  Well you're supposed to fight Rampage  But he's hurt  And you can't  No I fought Rampage  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I mean Rashad  Rashad Evans  Yeah me and Rashad  We've both had like injuries  And the fight's just not panning out  To happen so far  But it'll happen  I'm sure right after this  Lioto fight  It'll be either  Rashad Evans  That's a fight everyone wants to see  Yeah  John Jones or Rashad Evans  Holy shit  They're calling that the Ali Frazier  Of our sport  You know  That comparison  Of just  The hype that's behind it  You had no problem  With Rampage  Were you surprised by that 
[01:58:30]  At all  You know  You know  I knew  I was very confident  In my game plan  I knew that  My best chances  Of losing the fight  Was to stand in the pocket  With him  The guy has  Devastated knockout power  Left hand and right hand  He can hit any angle  So you know  I knew if I stayed  Out of the pocket  And used my longest range weapon  Which is my leg kicks  And my push kicks  And things  That I'd be fine  So I was confident  But I didn't know  It was going to go like that  I mean  He actually  Only hit me one time  Throughout the fight  Yeah  Which is nuts 
[01:59:00]  Is there ever a moment  In a fight like that  Where you're like  Do you know you're going to win  Or is that sport  Just so crazy  That you can't even  Allow yourself to think that  Yeah  You can't even allow yourself  To think that  I mean  This is going great  You're just down  Yeah  No way  You got to be on point  At all times  At the fight  You know  Crazy thing with me  I think I have ADD  So just keeping that level  Of concentration  And focus  He's looking at people  In the crowd  For 25 rounds  Yeah I'm like  When is this going to be over  You know  I'm not going to have ADD 
[01:59:30]  That's hilarious  Yeah  He gave it up to you too  Rampage  He never does that  He's like  This guy's the real deal  He's great  Like when he was talking  At the end  He really praised you  Yeah  It was nuts  Because before the fight  You know Rampage  He kept making fun of me  He had a thousand  Different names to call me  Every media outlet  We did  You know  He was down on me  And down on my game  Down on my coaching staff  So I was like  You know  I'm really starting  To hate this guy  You know  And so  After the fight  There was a photographer  Called a pitcher 
[02:00:00]  With my foot  Literally inside of his mouth  And I was like  You know what  You know  I just wanted  It was just so iconic  You know  But because  Because he was so respectful  Right after the fight  And gave me the props  That I deserve  You know  He  I decided not to make that  The display picture  On my Twitter page  Does that go into making you  Want to hit a guy more  Like  Or does it mess you up  Like  Because Ali would get  In people's heads  And then they couldn't  Fight him  Because they were so mad  If a guy is just 
[02:00:30]  Shit-talking you  Does it  Does it  Does it kind of  Put so much anger  In you  That it could throw you off  You know  It doesn't  It doesn't work for me  Like that  You know  I try to keep it  More about the competition  You know  Let's  Let's  Save all the trash talk  Unless he was the better athlete  And the better combatant  But with Rampage  You know  He just kept insulting me  So much  It  It didn't cloud my mind  Or throw me off  But I just  It made me want to finish  The fight more  You know  I didn't want the fight  To go to the decision  I wanted to  Try to knock him out  Or embarrass him  And that picture  Was pretty embarrassing 
[02:01:00]  I didn't see the photo  Yeah  That's because I never put it up  Because he was respectful  After the fight  So I said  You know what  Let's shake hands  And walk our separate ways  Like man  Yeah  I'll let you slide  You let him slide  I'm trying to think  How to ask this question  Without you giving up  Any sort of secret  But what is the most  Like I don't know  What hurts the most  The elbows  Whenever I watch that  I always think  For some reason  Just laying on the ground  That ground and pound  Somebody just dropping  Those elbows  Yeah  Yeah  That's my signature  The ground and pound  Yeah  Every time I get my opponent down  And start raining elbows down on him 
[02:01:30]  You know  When he gets back to his feet  He just doesn't seem the same  It takes a lot of people's will  Yeah  What level of training  Can you do  Where you can handle  That charley horse kick  An Olympic level one  I can't believe you guys  Can still stand up  I was in a cab yesterday  And Bobby punched me  In the leg  And I limped into the restroom  And that's Bobby  Just sitting there  Half a jab  Some traditional martial artists  They do body conditioning  And that's where  They literally take turns  Kicking each other  In the legs  And they do these drills 
[02:02:00]  Where they bang  Their forearms together  And after a while  Your body starts to harden  And you know  Not be susceptible  To damage  Right  You know  I haven't taken things that far  I just really get out of the way  So there is ways  To condition yourself  But I don't think  It's very common right now  In our sport  Can't imagine  Yeah  Well my shins are pretty  My shins are pretty conditioned  It's unbelievable  Your elbows are  That's the worst thing in MMA  Is his elbows  There was one  You hit Shogun  And I think you spun around  And hit him with a left elbow  In the face  You're impossible to figure out 
[02:02:30]  Because big guys  When you get in on a tall guy  At least his reach can't be used  But you just put your knees and elbows  In the guy's face  And we talked  That's a Muay Thai 101  We talked about that move  On our show  And your arms are so long  I swear to God  It almost looked like  It was a fist  And it was his elbow  Coming around  Right  Remember that?  Yeah I love it  See I found myself  Being at a disadvantage  Whenever guys are too close to me  Because they have  An 84.5 inch reach  It's the same leech  As Lennox Lewis  So you know  I had to figure out  What am I going to do  To defend myself  When these guys  Are all up on my grill  Right 
[02:03:00]  So I started working  Tons of Muay Thai  Tons of knees  Tons of elbows  And more importantly  Tons of takedowns  From the clinch  And yeah  It's become a good  Defense and offense  Short range  It seems like  There's no good way  To approach you  From a fighter's point of view  Because the closer you get  The more likely you are  To take a knee in the face  And that's just  A horrible  Horrible place to be  I'm glad it appears that way  Yeah it really does  It's fighting  We love how you fight  It's exciting  Right Jimmy?  Yeah it's unpredictable  It really is  Everything people think  You're going to do  You don't  Again in the Shogun fight 
[02:03:30]  There was one  You went for a leg lock  And then he's laying on the back  And he just hammer fisted  In the face  How embarrassing  Yeah  The least expected  Is hard to block  Yeah  Oh yeah  It seems like you train like that  Or is that just your natural instinct  In fighting?  A lot of it's training  And then a lot of it's just  Having an open mind  And creativity  You know I'm always meditating  I'm fighting  And thinking about new openings  And you know  I think I'm a really big  A big student of myself  You know I watch my own fights a lot  And I realize  Man you know 
[02:04:00]  If I had more awareness  Maybe I can add that in there  Or do that next time  And do that next time  And you know  I take that mindset  And I bring it to the gym  And I start working  All the things that I could have done  And then once you get to the fight  You know you just find yourself  Way more openings  And way more ideals  And you just start doing  All types of creative things out there  When was the last time  Somebody didn't know who you were  Just like a civilian  And started giving you shit  And what do you think  During that moment?  You know what  That's funny  That doesn't happen too often 
[02:04:30]  You know  Whenever I'm out  You know I'm usually out  With a few buddies  And I'm always like  One of the more fit guys around  And I always have a smile on my face  So you know  People want to start with me  It's just rare  Oh alright  I would love  The smile diffuses  That would be the greatest  YouTube video ever  Oh no kidding  What's up buddy?  What's up?  Fucker  Fuck it  Get off me  Get off me  There he goes  Yeah  That's what guys like us  Fantasize about  It's like if we  If we were like that  It's like the moment  The guy said something 
[02:05:00]  We're like  Excuse me  Like I would be reacting  Like I react as a nerd now  That's just not the way  You carry yourself  When you can fight I think  I know  When was the last time  You were afraid walking home?  I can't remember  Superhero  It's funny  Because I train in Albuquerque  And me and about five of my teammates  That trained at Jackson's MMA  Were out downtown one night  And a guy was getting jumped  He provoked the whole fight  But he was getting jumped  By a group of guys 
[02:05:30]  So it was about five against one  And it was me and my five buddies  That were out  And we were watching this happen  And one of my teammates was like  Let's get over there  Let's go get him  Let's go stand up for that guy  I'm like  Well first you gotta realize  All these guys are drunk  And the guy that's getting jumped  Tried to take on five guys  So this is his own problem  In a way  And I was like  Could you imagine  A YouTube video  With us pro fighters  It looked like the Power Rangers  Beating up these idiots  I'm like dude 
[02:06:00]  Come on  Yeah you gotta let that guy  Learn his lesson  Yeah well the police came  Before we know it  And it wasn't that too bad  He actually fought them all off  He did alright  Dude like we're doing  Spinning  Spinning crescent kicks  Who are these guys  Guys just windmilling at you  Trying to get a punch in  So you have no temptation  To step in  Like if you saw  I've always thought  Like what would I do  And build a funny bit on it  You see like a domestic violence  Episode or whatever  What would you do  And it's like you want to help  But it's scary  To think it would be turned on you  Would you jump in  Or 
[02:06:30]  Yeah well  My last  The last time I stood up  And used my martial arts  Was the day of my title fight  In Patterson New Jersey  You know me and my coaches  We're meditating at a park  In Patterson  And we hear a couple screaming  Run over to the scene  And there's an old couple  With their windows busted out  With their standing  Next to their car  Crying  And they said  They had just been robbed  So me and my coaches  We catch the telling  Of this guy  And we chase him down  You know  And me being  Probably in the best shape  Getting ready to fight  You know four hours later 
[02:07:00]  I catch up to the guy first  And I late kick him  And take him down  And I hold him  Until my coaches come  And we all subdue this guy  And the Patterson police  They come  And they arrest the guy  And we get this woman  What happens to be  Her GPS system back  And she was just so grateful  You know  It was all over TMZ  That guy's  He's got to still be  Telling that story  Oh yeah  Alright  Two old people  Easy target  Easy fucking target  Out of fucking nowhere  This god damn superhero  Shows up  Wrong time  Wrong place man  I love it 
[02:07:30]  This whole body  Fell like an elbow  I love it  I love that fighting  Is so second hand  Or first hand  You're just like  Yeah  The day of the fight  I just got into  Another quick fight  If I kick somebody  I'd be down for a month  I'd be like  That's it  For me  And you  Just  Whatever  It's just like  You know  It's business as usual  Day at the office  I mean we all have our niche  And fighting's what I do best  But you know  It was cool  You know  To use like my gift  In a positive light  Like that  And to show people 
[02:08:00]  That you know  Mixed martial arts  Not only builds character  But you know  You can  You know  It's just so much greatness  You're not the Cobra Kai  Yeah  You're the friendly dojo  How silly is it  This misconception  That it's so violent  When the fights  No way  MMA fighters  Take the abuse  Boxers do  Because you're not  Getting punched  For 12 rounds  No way  And you're going to  Make a lot of  Boxers upset  Out there to hear  But it's just true  You know  It's fact real  MMA is actually  One of the safest  Sports you can play  You know  You got football players  You got these  230 pound men  Running as fast as they can 
[02:08:30]  And clashing into each other  You got the linemen  You know  Blasting each other  Off the whistle  Play by play  Those guys get  Tons of concussions  You guys  You got  Boxers  You know  Boxers  You know  The primary goal  Is to  Knock each other's heads off  Right  Round after round  You get knocked down  You get an 8 count  To stand back up  And get another concussion  You know  These sports are pretty dangerous  You know  You know  I'm a champion  And out of my last  Four fights 
[02:09:00]  I've been hit  About five times  In the face total  Which is a nuts statistic  And you know  A lot of times  Fights are won  By leg kicks  Or submission  There's an honorable way  To just say  I've had enough  By tapping out  You know  So  Where I guess  It looks brutal  Because of the blood  And the ground  And the pound  And everything  Common injuries  We go home with  Is maybe a cut over the eye  Or a black eye  Or maybe some bruised ribs  Or anything  But I mean  It's not nearly as dangerous  The only one  That looks crazy  Is after the dude's  Knocked out 
[02:09:30]  And you guys  Are so quick  That you get  Those other 17  In  Is that  That  17  Really  I'm just  You know  I put myself  Into  Who I would be  In the fight  And it's always  The loser  So I always see  Myself laying there  Going  Stop  Stop it  Hoping someone  Would get there  In time  And you just see  Your job opportunities  Going down  Like manager of a restaurant  Waiter  Busboy  Eating out of the dumpster  Please  Get to this guy  That's funny  You know  A lot of times 
[02:10:00]  The fans are so upset  Because they feel  As if fights are being  Stopped  Way too fast  Yeah  You know  The referees  They're aware  You know  They know our backgrounds  They know our stories  And they also know  That our wives  Are sitting on the front row  So you know  They stop the fights  Pretty fast  Do you ever get annoyed  When some crowd  When there's really  Some strategy going on  When it's down on the ground  And they start booing  Does that ever bother you  You just want to stop fighting  And be like  Do you understand  What the fuck I'm doing  Down here  You assholes  This is important too  Right  You know  That's the biggest difference 
[02:10:30]  Between the pride organization  And the UFC  You know  Pride originated  In Japan  And the Japanese fan base  They had so much more respect  For every aspect  Of martial arts  You know  They really carry  That martial arts  Demeanor  And energy  With them  You know  UFC fans  Are a little bit more  About the kickboxing  And the big knockout  They just want to see  Some blood  And some knockouts  America  Yeah  They don't want to see  Two guys  Rolling around  On the mat  So  You know  The UFC fans  They're really starting  To pick up  And realize  That jiu-jitsu 
[02:11:00]  Is a cultural thing  It's a thing  That has lots of history  And they're really starting  To understand  What guard passing is  And full mount  And all the different positions  They're having  You know  A lot more respect  For it nowadays  So it's not as bad  As it used to be  But they're learning  We're getting there  And it's got to be said  Youngest UFC champion  John Jones  Are you 23?  24 now  When you want to be  You see this beard  Oh you look like  A much more distinguished gentleman  But no  When you won the belt  You were 23 I think right?  I won the belt  Yeah I was 23  Okay  And you've only been fighting  In the UFC 
[02:11:30]  What?  Four or five months now?  Actually  Years  Yeah  My first martial arts class  Was four years ago  Four years ago  Yeah  Which is  It's nuts to me  To think of how far  Who's the poor bastard  Locked up with you?  I'll take the new fish  Yeah  It was some kid  From Boxborough  Massachusetts  This kid had no clue  What he was getting into  Right  I mean how long  Have you been in the UFC though?  You know  Just about two years 
[02:12:00]  Oh okay  About two years  Wow  Been moving fast  I'm so passionate  About the sport  How did you take  Martial arts for you?  What did you do before that?  Were you fighting your whole life?  Like boxing or just?  No  Actually you know  I wrestled  I wrestled in high school  And I wrestled in college  Two years at Iowa Central  And you know  After I graduated from school  I just had this void  Like I felt like  I wasn't living fulfilled  You know  I had to continue  Competing somehow  So I ended up  Joining a jiu-jitsu school  Got pretty good at jiu-jitsu  And my jiu-jitsu coach  Encouraged me to  Go with martial arts  Full speed ahead 
[02:12:30]  And that's what I did  And you know  I just  Had this vision  That I will be a champion  One day  And I carry myself  Like that  And I trained that way  And meditated on fighting  You know  Study fighting  As much as possible  And I found myself  Catching up to guys  Who have been doing it  12, 14 years  Unbelievable  I met you briefly  Me and Bob Kelly  Actually  It was the very famous  Frank Muir  It was the Muir-Lesnar fight  Oh yeah  And we were back  We just had  Reed Harris introduced us  Very briefly  And Bobby goes  That guy's going to be a champion  After we walked away  He goes  He's the best fighter  Bobby knows his shit  Yeah Bobby's really  He really knows his shit 
[02:13:00]  Yeah he's not here today  Intuitive  Are you  You're from Rochester originally?  Yep  Inner city Rochester  When did you leave?  I moved from Rochester  In 98  Oh  98 I think I was about 10  Oh okay  You've never had a garbage plate then  I have Nick Tahoe's  Yeah yeah  I love garbage plates  I try to explain the garbage plate  To these guys  Yeah it's been years though man  Honestly it's been a long time  I probably shouldn't be eating  Too many of those nowadays  Yeah no  The Nick Tahoe garbage plate  Is legendary up there  Oh yeah  It is just a slop of  Everything  No people  You haven't had one 
[02:13:30]  No  It's so hard to have discipline  You know it's like  I try  Three days in a row  I've done elliptical  And I'm like  Alright  Now you can treat yourself  Jimmy  Treat yourself  Is there an unplug button?  I know right  Yeah  Three days in a row  When I figured  Why not have dessert last night  I don't know how you guys  I talked to Jimmy  He likes to treat himself  I do  He likes to treat himself  By the way  He's a nice man  But what he did  Is he looked  And he just looked  Out of my stomach real quick  And then looked back up  And laughed at me  Oh man  Oh three days  I bet you he never treats himself  John Jones  Yeah when do you 
[02:14:00]  We always ask fighters this  When do you binge?  I mean there has to be a time  Where you kind of let yourself  Go for a week  Or do you  Yeah definitely  Right after a fight  Usually I take off  About a solid month  You know no training  I try not to even watch a fight  And just you know  Maintain like somewhat  Of a normal lifestyle  You know I am 24  And all my friends  Are around that age  So their priorities  Are way different than mine  Responsibility levels  Are way different than mine  And sometimes it's just good  To go back to my hometown  And just remind them  That I'm still one of them  And you know  Hang out  Play video games 
[02:14:30]  For several hours  With the guys  And just sit around  And chill you know  And kick in  And let them know  That none of this  Has changed me  When you start to train  How long do you train  For a fight?  I train about three  Three to four solid months  Of all nutrition  You know  Three times a day  Four times a day  That's a lot  It's taxing on the body  And on the mind  Man the pressure  Of knowing that  You know  If you were to lose  Everyone's going to have  That on their DVR  Fight them  Yeah  Oh wow  You know what I mean  That's what really  Gets my butt out of bed  In the morning  Oh it's some pressure  Oh fuck  Yeah  That's what's always 
[02:15:00]  Blowing my mind  Is just sitting there  Training  And you just know  There's somebody else  Training  To kick the shit  Out of you  At like the  Highest level  Yeah  It's way different  Than like you know  Being on a basketball team  Like oh we lost  The game tonight  You know  That sucked  You lose the game  And you're going  To be hurt  Or the embarrassment  The fear of being exposed  Yeah  I think that's really  What it is  And it's not a team  Either really  Even though you have  Your crew  It's almost like  Stand up  Like I always got  Jealous of people  In bands  That if you went out  And it wasn't going well  At least you had 
[02:15:30]  Three other guys  There  The drummer was all  Yeah yeah  Yeah you can always  Kind of go down  But yeah it's totally  It's totally on you man  All improv man  Jesus  And you can't control  You know you can't  Control what your opponent  Is going to do  You know reactions  You got to control  Your own body  Your own energy  And his  And it's just  One big masterpiece  And you fight only  What two  Maybe three times a year  Right  You know I've actually  Fought four times a year  It's the first time  In our sports history  That's a lot right  That a champion  Has fought in three  World titles  And you know  Three world titles  In one year  So yeah 
[02:16:00]  I've had a big  Do you have a problem  With the family  Of someone you beat down  As you're walking  Out of the ring  Where they ever get  Like upset  No you know  I haven't had that issue yet  UFC fighters are pretty  Pretty down to earth  And pretty cool  Most of them  You know  A lot of times  You know you find the guys  At the same after parties  Or sharing a drink  And hey you know man  You kicked my butt tonight  You know  You know good job  I'll come back  And get you next time  Type of thing  So there's  There's very little animosity  After a defeat  You know we all respect each other  And know what we go through 
[02:16:30]  To get ready for a performance  So how can you not  Respect a guy like that  That respectful in defeat  Yeah  I wish I could be  That respectful in victory  If he kicked my ass  I'd go  Oh next time  But if I won  I would be an arrogant prick  Stink  Smack you in the face  Get away from me  Send your wife over here  Exactly like  Mr. T in Rocky 3  No cause that's what  I was thinking  Hey woman  Hey woman  I was thinking that shit  Cause you know 
[02:17:00]  When you're telling jokes  On stage  You ever do that  And you see the boyfriend  Start getting mad  But you literally  Beat down the boyfriend  In front of his wife  Or girlfriend  That's just a whole  Another level  Of complete domination  So I would figure  That there would  There would be  Some sort of animosity  Give her a wink  Did you like that  Yeah  It's how a real man  Thrills her to me  Hey Rashad and you  Had a history together too  Like of training together  And everyone says  That that's a pretty good matchup  Or harder for you  Than say fighting a rampage  Or whatever  And what is your situation 
[02:17:30]  With him  It's funny  We haven't tried ever  As we train together  For about a year  You know  And we obviously  Had our falling out  You know  He got injured  And the UFC  Offered me  The chance to step  In his spot  And challenge the champion  For his belt  When he got injured  He said  Listen John  You're like a little brother  To me  There's no one  I would rather see  Take my place  For the belt  You know  Challenge  Than you  You know  I believe  That you're ready  And that you're  Going to win this belt  So you know  Best of luck to you  Came to my dinner 
[02:18:00]  You know  With my family  And closest friends  And gave me this spiel  And I said  Okay cool man  You know  And our friendship  Was tight  You know  I had his blessing  To go out there  And win the world championship  I don't think  I don't think  He expected me  To win it  Maybe  And I actually  Won the championship  And his tone  Changed pretty fast  Saying oh  If he was really  My friend  He would have  Never stepped in  And I'm like  Hey listen  I'm a young man  Trying to pursue my dream  And I had  There was a job opening  And you gave me  The blessing  To take this position  And now that  I'm doing so well  At it  You know  Now I became  The enemy  And I become  The traitor somehow 
[02:18:30]  So you know  For the people  Who follow the storylines  Pretty closely  They totally understand  That that's exactly  What it was  And so you know  Now he's doing  All these interviews  Telling people that  You know  Because he trained with me  He can crack my code  And he knows  The best ways  To beat me in  And he's seen me  Quit in practice  And he knows my openings  And all this stuff  But what he doesn't realize  Is that  I've only been competing  For four years  Rashad's been  He's been competing  For you know 
[02:19:00]  Eight years  Or maybe ten years  So with the experience  Come many tendencies  And my game is  Elevating  By the month  So I'm not the same  Fighter that he  Competed against  When we were training  Against each other  And where he feels  As if he knows  My tendencies  I totally know  His tendencies  Because of the fact  That not only do I  Have way more footage  To study  But I've trained  With him as well  So I'm excited  For when that fight  Take place  I'm more than confident  That I'll do  Exactly what  You know  That I've been doing  You know  Studying these opponents 
[02:19:30]  Knowing my enemy  Knowing myself  Not being naive  To my downfalls  And weaknesses  And just  Playing the game  That I love  Can you give us  An Ali prediction  What round  What's it going to be  You know  You know  I usually don't  Get predictions  But  Rashad Evans  Come on  And you mean  For Machida  For this Saturday  Yeah you know  Exactly  It's probably not smart  To look past Leo Machida  No that's what  Tyson look past  Buster Douglas  Big mistake  You never want to  Look past him  At the same time 
[02:20:00]  The Rashad Evans fight  Is inevitable  It has to happen  The UFC fans want it  And it's going to happen  So obviously  I'm not looking past Leo  But for the Rashad Evans fight  I'm definitely predicting  A knockout  And Leo  I would just say  I'm going to go out there  Have fun  Play the game that I love  And do my best  Like always  By the way  Did you see the great advice  I just gave him  That's all I would offer  In training camp  Hey remember Tyson Douglas  That's all I would have to say  I offered you nothing  Thank God  You can be my hype man  Yeah go on  Tyson Douglas 
[02:20:30]  Douglas Tyson  I just keep saying it different  Mike and Buster  One of the most famous fights  That there's no way  He doesn't know about  I know  There's no way  That motivates any fighter anymore  It's 25 years ago  But I can see  Where it would be hard  To look past one guy  To another guy  Do you think  With you and Rashad  Because we had him in  And he didn't speak badly of you  But is it harder to fight a guy  Who is a close friend  Like do you almost need something  That makes you  Willing to go out 
[02:21:00]  And kick the shit out of him  Or him you  Well the thing about me and Rashad  Is that you know  We're not close friends  By any means anymore  You know  There's been lots of words  Said between us  And you know  I'm honestly  I'm honestly  Kind of over it in a way  You know  I just want to see  The competition  You know  Same thing with Rampage  There's so much talk going on  I just want to see  Who's the better athlete now  But it's safe to say  That there's no friendship there  Whatsoever  So it'll be business as usual  When we get in there  I'm sure the first time  He swings at me  I'm like 
[02:21:30]  Okay  Let's  You know  Let's do this  Let's do this  So  Would it be harder to do  If you were still close  It would be  It would be harder to do  You know  I don't think the kickbacks  On the expat  Would be very hard  Because I kickbox my teammates  All the time  For practice  But one thing I don't do  In practice very often  Is ground upon my teammates  You know  Ground upon us  Always practice  On a big bag  On the floor  Right  So you know  I've never elbowed  A friend in the face  And that part will be hard  But you know  Swinging  Swinging for home runs  On the feet  You know 
[02:22:00]  That'll go a lot easier  See if I was Rashad  That would be a ploy  I would do  I would say nothing  But nice things about you  Because even though  You would maybe still win  It would make it harder for you  Like on the ground  You'd like  You know  You remember that shit I said  It was nice  You're trying to make eye contact  Make a little set  How's the family  How's the family  You kids alright  Yeah you have an elbow  In the throat  I was watching that too  And it was  You were covering  And you were allowed to do that  In mixed martial arts  Cover the mouth  Oh yeah  So you can't breathe  Yeah that's old school  Yeah you know  You can breathe through it  But it just deserves the breathing 
[02:22:30]  Your breathing pattern  And it's just  It's a very uncomfortable feeling  It kind of makes you feel like  You're drowning under there  A little bit  And you're so constant  I'm sure you're so concentrating  On the fact like  I gotta breathe  I gotta breathe  You're not really thinking about  What you have to be doing  Like throwing punches  Or getting the fuck out of there  No way you're trying to focus on  Getting your breathing pattern back  Well he was on his back  That's brutal  And you're so long  That your legs are open  It's hard to grab  It's impossible to get  Jon Jones off you  And you had your hand over his face  And when he finally got rid of that  You just put your elbow  And the ref had to keep saying  On the face  Not the neck  Not the neck 
[02:23:00]  Because your elbow  Was kind of  Stopping his head  It was terrible  Terrible beating  You make it sound so brutal  No but it wasn't  It wasn't anything unnecessary  It was just  It's a beautiful thing people  Let me ask you this  You ever watch those shows  On people going to prison  And that type of stuff  They'll show inside  Like me  Those shows are absolutely  Terrifying to me  Going there's no fucking way  I could survive in there  Do you  Do you just watch those  That's like a comedy  Are you gonna try to shake me  Are you serious  You and how many  As cellmates  What are you gonna do  With that thing 
[02:23:30]  Really  That's funny  I don't know  So we're talking like  What is it  Oz  Is that what the show called  Oz yeah  No I mean literally  Like on like  National Geographic  Where they'll go into  San Quentin  And you just see  You know  You just see these people  You know  Some people having a good time  In there  Some people  Not having such a good time  Not so much  Haven't really fell in  With a gang or anything  I was just wondering  Well there's a skinny  Redhead white guy  I don't know  I was joking on my podcast  I would be exotic  In prison  I don't even try 
[02:24:00]  I'd just tie my shirt  Off at the waist  And pick one guy  And look like  I'd kill everybody else  Hey I'd take care of you  I just realized  I just realized  I couldn't do it  I don't know  I'd fight you  I think I'd just kill myself  No I got  No I even remember  If I came out  I would attack a guard  Because I figured  At the end of the day  At least he's not gonna rape me  You know  I'll just take the beat down  And you're guaranteed  He's gonna look the other way  When you are getting raped  Yeah  That's the asshole  That hit me 
[02:24:30]  Fuck up  Literally  Fuck up  They wouldn't rape you  If you were exotic though  They would all try to  Woo you with desserts  Just keep taking cigarettes  See if I can  Buy my way out of it  Come on guys  Come on  I got some commissary  Here for you  I went to San Quentin  With Kenny  When we were in San Francisco  Classic  And they said  That Liddell had been there  Not long before we were  And they said  The place went  Fucking berserk for him  Just applauded  And screamed  Yeah they all love these guys  Oh my god 
[02:25:00]  He walks in with that mohawk  They must have felt  Like they were in a movie  Like they were gonna  Take over the prison  Or some shit  I saw Chuck recently  And you know  Chuck is known for his  That mohawk  That's his signature thing  And he has a wife now  Is he getting married?  She gelled it  And curled it  Oh shit  And it wasn't quite right  Not quite that  Intimidating look  Chuck  I looked up to you  Chuck  What is this currently  Wasn't Bloodsport Chuck anymore?  It wasn't  It wasn't 
[02:25:30]  Chuck done Hollywood  I was a little disappointed  He's so intimidating  He's still my brother  We've had him in here  A few times  All you guys are intimidating  Obviously  But Chuck Liddell  Takes the cake  He fucking breathes  Like a bull  Oh yeah  It's hard to get a reaction  From him  That's the ice man  But you don't want to hear  He loves us  But we don't know  Because he's never  Really shown any emotion  But you don't want to hear  Liddell going  Come on  Don't use those soaps  She'll kill me  Right right  Nobody wants to  I know  Exactly  Come on  It's not worth it  It's not worth it  Yeah  You know 
[02:26:00]  He deserves it though  He's painted the road  For guys like himself  So you know what  Wear what you want  Chuck  There you go  Yeah and if you want  To curl your mohawk  Diet pink if you want  No one's going to  Take it to his face  Yeah  Jimmy  I think maybe  If you could take  A little bump  Somehow  What do you think  What we do is  We do this thing  Where  Like I'm not a fighter  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  I just  But I always have the guys  We've had  Well they'll do something  On me  Like we've had 
[02:26:30]  Kane has done it  We've had Fedor  A lot of  Rashad put me in  Like some floor move  I don't want to  Like Anderson  Kick me lightly  His hurt the most  I think  Because it didn't hurt  As much in the moment  But I had a headache  For two hours  Because I'm not used  To being jostled  You've done about  10 or 12  About 10 or 12  Fighters  Do you have  Good health insurance  I do actually  After  So I  It's a split second thing  Like  He taps  Within a split second  Of these holes  That's no fun  Well it was  They all let me go 
[02:27:00]  Very quickly  Except Fedor  Did an arm thing  On me  And he kept  Well that was  A translation problem  He gave it a little more  No he understood  Because I tapped  And he laughed  And he smiled  And then he tightened up again  And then he loosened it  And then he tightened up again  Very unpleasant  But the recommendation  People have been  Like twittering me  What's the  It's D-A-R-C-E  How do you spell that  The D'Arce  Oh the D'Arce  The D'Arce  Okay  The D'Arce yeah  And what does that entail  I don't know  Well let's see it  Alright let's do it  Well what is it  Really  I'm actually not the best  At the D'Arce choke  What is your favorite choke  Hmm 
[02:27:30]  Favorite choke  I was actually planning  On spinning back kicking you  Definitely  I really  Jesus Christ  I literally would be afraid  That I would die  But I would love to take a  I just couldn't do it  I just know  That it would be unpleasant  Spinning  I have good control  Do you  Yeah  He's confident Jimmy  Where would you kick me  Right in the solar plex  No  Cause you'd feel bad  Your foot would smush in  At my stomach  You don't need that  I'd take it maybe  It would just be embarrassing  Yeah you might actually  How about a good leg kick  Okay 
[02:28:00]  A leg kick  Sure  Yeah  Leg kick  You're gonna be walking funny  For a while  I know  I would take it  I would request mild though  Not to  I can't think of  John Jones kick for real  A mild  I have to  Salsa  I have to  Salsa  You have devastating  Devastating legs  Yeah we've seen your kicks  Holy shit  Yeah  At least I don't  Leg kicks ladies and gentlemen  Alright  Alright here we go  Alright  Jim Norton  Yeah  A little leg kick  You ever throw in a leg kick  This early in the morning  I haven't  Five and nine  This is like a singer  I remind him of one of those bags  That he uses  Just don't pull anything please 
[02:28:30]  Alright where are you gonna go  Just so I can  Alright so I'm gonna get you  Right around here  Oh that already looked painful  Right there  Okay  Alright so you might wanna  Brace yourself  Not that hard  Okay  Alright  Can you get it  Okay  Give me a good angle  Yeah yeah yeah  Jesus Christ Jimmy  Alright perfect hands up  Do I have to do it  That seems combative  How about  Do you wanna close your eyes  No  I don't wanna be combative  With my hands  Go ahead  That seems combative  Where are we going  Right here  Yeah  Alright here we go  Oh no  One 
[02:29:00]  Two  And  Three  Oh  Oh that was a delayed pain too  Come on Jimmy  Don't go down  Don't go down  Don't go down  Oh yeah  I never went down right  I feel like I have to shit  Oh that was the worst one ever  Oh is that  Yeah  The best leg kicks  You don't hear the noise  Yeah you just  That's all  All the earth  Straight to bone 
[02:29:30]  Dude  All the weight  And that was just  T-ball speed too  Oh yeah  That was just a little  Oh god  That's a great picture  Jimmy doesn't know if he wants to  Keep standing or sit down  Jesus Christ  The visual of that on my phone  Fuck that  You guys gotta look at this on my phone  It's Jimmy's entire body in the frame  And then just his torso  That's all you can see  It literally looks like a giant  Just coming in and kicking Norton in the leg  Yeah I was expecting to hear like a crack or a snap or something 
[02:30:00]  That was just all power  Or thud  Into  And where did it hit you Jimmy  Right in the thigh  In the thigh  Was it like a Charlie  I had to piss  What kind of pain is it  What kind of pain is it  I had to puke  No you're okay  It almost instantly takes away from your cardio  Don't you think  Did you get  Did you get woozy  Are you like  I feel like I'm gonna puke  Faint  Really  Yeah  Doesn't it hurt so good  He kind of likes it  I think Jimmy simply likes this shit  You're pale 
[02:30:30]  You're pale right now  I do have to pee though  Jimmy's into the S&M  Why don't you go  Well we're ready for a break  Jimmy's a funny gimp  We'll take a break  Jimmy's green  Wow  You guys splash some water on your face  Yeah your color's a little weird  He's like gonna throw up  I'm gonna go pee  You ever do that where you hurt yourself  And you feel like you're gonna throw up  Like you're falling in your knee  Or something  That's how he feels  Now I see why Rogan loves the leg kicks  That took any fight out of him  I like to do  Look he's limping down the hallway 
[02:31:00]  To go to the bathroom  He's done about a dozen of these  I think it's over after today  That was it  I think he's not doing anymore  That was it  That was the one that got him  I loved how he thought that initial pain  Was the pain  Yeah  One three second he went  Ah  Oh  And the best way to get it out  Is to rub on it  Which only hurts worse  Really  Yeah yeah  You gotta kind of work it out I guess  Right  That's gonna be  That's gonna be a big time bruise man  That's a good one man  Jimmy does not look good  Tweet me a picture of his leg tomorrow  Oh yeah yeah  Fuck yeah  What are you on Twitter 
[02:31:30]  Johnny Bones  Yeah  At Johnny Bones  At Johnny Bones  J-O-N-N-Y-B-O-N-E-S  I start following you today  Yes  All right  Johnny Bones on Twitter  Let's all follow John Jones  What's your Twitter  O-P-Radio  Oh easy  Yeah  I'm actually  I got a little video  I'll  I'll  At Johnny Bones  What was that  Was that like 8% speed  Would you say  That was about a  15%  15 double digits  Oh  Oh god  That face and everything  He got some great still shots 
[02:32:00]  You guys see the still shots  Jimmy's face and that  He's just like  Ah  Yeah  We'll be tweeting all that shit later  Classic  He'll tweet it with your name  So you can check it out  We got great pictures  You gotta see the video  That Sam took too  I got the front  I gotta commend him  I would've gone down  He would've went down  Yeah yeah  Jimmy was leaning on the console  Like oh  For fear that the fact I didn't  He would do it again  Oh I should've kicked him harder  Nah nah  That's all he can take  He's hurting  Believe me  He's in the bathroom right now  Just about crying 
[02:32:30]  Splashing water on his face  So he doesn't faint  Often do you get a free one  Man  And it looks slow  But it must be like  If a car hit you  At like 10 miles an hour  You know what I mean  That's not going that fast  I really focused on the shin bone  Digging right into the appropriate spot  You hit and then straighten your leg out  It's like all that just  I don't get how you guys kick each other  Basically shin to shin  That's that body conditioning  I was telling you about  Getting kicked to the shin  How do you build up anything  In front of your shin  Where it doesn't hurt you  Oh yeah  It takes a long time 
[02:33:00]  To get used to that  The guys in Thailand  They kick trees  They kick these trees  Oh man  That's crazy  But they can't walk  By the time they're 40 right  No no  Are they all right  It just strengthens your  As long as you're not hitting with your knees  And you're hitting an appropriate part of your shin  Okay  It conditions your shin  And it's amazing what the human body can get used to really  You can't get used to the foot stomp though  Foot stumps no  Those are all fragile bones  And pretty much  Most guys don't do that right  Most guys don't do the foot stumps  I actually do it  I do it  You do it  But you know  It's really not as effective 
[02:33:30]  As people may think  Because the heel of your foot  Isn't really that hard  You know  Right  Yeah  So the stomping  It's more annoying  No I'm just picturing that  Are you serious  And you guys  You know their heels  Are like a Timberland  It's steel  Like an axe handle  A martial arts heel  Fuck yeah  It would work if you had  Like a nice stretch heel  End of my toes would explode  We're getting the wrap up  So  What happened  Oh we gotta get Jimmy first  Uh oh  Did he puke  No  You puke  No 
[02:34:00]  Okay  You know what  I should have kicked you a lot harder  Oh no  That was really good  Like uh  Dude your color's back  Your color got a little weird  I'm not used to taking that kind of impact  And I know that's not nearly as hard as he could have done it  Oh no  No  He's bummed out  Because we just showed him the video  He's like  I should have hit him harder  Oh no  Can we try it again  Let's go under legs  What do you say ladies  I would have thrown up  Under legs  I'm amazed  And the reason I do that is  I'm such a fan  I'm amazed by these guys  That they can take  Like you did that in a gentle 
[02:34:30]  Compared to what you could do  Well he said it was about 15%  But dude  Can you imagine 100%  But imagine  And his motivation was  I'm trying to take his belt  John  John if you did it 100%  And you talk shit about him too  Hold on  If you did that 100%  To someone like Jimmy  Would you break his leg?  Would that break a bone?  He probably wouldn't break  But  It'd be hurting real bad  By five minutes  After the impact  I would probably pass out  Yeah you'd probably pass out  You'd probably want to be walking on it  Yeah  You'd probably want to go to the hospital  See the thing is  At 100%  You wouldn't even see it coming 
[02:35:00]  Oh  So just imagine  Someone swinging a baseball  At your sciatic nerve  Without even knowing  She's just like  Hey how you  Oh fuck  Kenny got me a bag of ice  Thanks buddy  I'll put this on my leg  Will you bruise from that Jimmy?  He will be  By the time John Jones  Is in the elevator  I'll be bruised  He will be  I didn't even kick him hard  Put that on your badge  Could you bleep that?  On the video I'll just say  This was only 15%  Dude and I got  Frankie Edgar hit me 
[02:35:30]  He gave me like a little left in the arm  And oh what a bruise  I had from that  Well he wants to see the bruise  So you gotta tweet him  Johnny  Oh yeah yeah  Johnny Bones  Absolutely  Johnny Bones  I swear to god  I'm so like  I used to see the bruise  I was ready to just drop my jeans  In the studio  I don't think it's bruised yet  You'd be doing that in prison  Literally  And they don't give you ice in prison  You see these things  But you never know  What these guys are dealing with  It's amazing to me  We have to do the old wrap up 
[02:36:00]  Unfortunately  Oh shit  We've been looking forward to this  For a while  Yeah we're fans man  We're big time fans  Thanks man  I used to be a fan  You used to be a fan  No I'm rooting for you  Against Machida this Saturday  Thanks  Let's plug the  I think he's my favorite  In the UFC right now  Yeah it's hard to like  Anybody more  Yeah well thanks guys  It's just how you fight and stuff  We just love it  I appreciate it  It's Machida  This coming Saturday  Live on pay per view  It's Johnny Bones on Twitter  What else  And Frank  Well also  Frank Muir is fighting  Minotaur Nogueira

[02:37:00]  To lose this week  Because the standards  And silver comparison  People get  But he fights at like  What 180  How is that done  Strong dieting  Strong dieting  You wear those  Like that glad  Bag running suits  You know I try not to  Do too much of the sweating  It's really not good for you  In the long term  But you know the day  Before the fight  The day of weigh-ins  I cut about 4 pounds of sweat  Which is pretty easy  Because you know  With a Peter light  Maybe an IV or something  You know you can get it all bad  That's amazing  You're going to lose  15 pounds this week 
[02:37:30]  You know I was a wrestler  Throughout high school  And college  So I think I've  I've developed that level  Of discipline  To walk away from  The cheeseburgers  Yeah  Yeah  Wow unbelievable  You almost made me  Throw up from a leg kick  That is a  Wow that's a fucking amazing  I wish I would have  Kicked him harder  I couldn't  Oh to see him  That would have been  The greatest ever  If he kicked him  And he just  Projected out  Vomited  And for the video  I kind of wish  It would have looked cool  We would still be laughing  Yeah but that  That was a fucking  Wow  I say you guys 
[02:38:00]  Have me on  After the fight  And I kick him  In the other leg  Yeah  Let's do it  Yeah  Why not  I mean just put me  It's a celebration  Of your big victory  No because he'll be  A little surly  After the fight too  Don't lose  No  How about after  If you lose  Then that kick  Is going to be ugly  Jimmy  Take your leg off  How do you take that  In the face  I don't get it  How the fuck  The guys take that  I just don't get it  They don't take it  It's superhuman  That's the key  Well John Jones  I hope you're champion  For a long time man  Absolutely  You're a great champion  And great spokesman  For the UFC  And you were great

[02:42:00]  Blunt force impact like that  Oh  It would be on your ass  Yeah  If he had put four fingers on my ass  I would have laughed my way  Through the entire segment  Where did it hit you?  He hit me  Right above the knee?  No no no no  He didn't go close to the knee  He did it at a place where he knew  There'd be no real damage  Up on the upper  Like the strongest part of your leg  Oh that's gonna be a great bruise  The charley horse place  He did it where the charley horse is  That's gonna be a great bruise  The fucking light  I can't wait  Heavyweight champion  Frankie  Did I show you the Frankie Edgar picture?  No you never  I never saw that  I twittered it 
[02:42:30]  He gave me a little shot in the arm  Like a little fucking  But these guys punch  That  Feels like a melon  And dude  I don't know how anybody  Like these guys  I know that they're conditioned  But when they're up against the cage  There's a guy standing there  That's what they're doing to each other  Like when they're trying to like  Get out of a clinch  They're just  They're doing these leg kicks  And these knees  The fucking face  And constant  Like imagine  You felt that  Imagine feeling it again  And then again  Dude  In the same place  What I just felt  About one of those  At 100% 
[02:43:00]  At 100%  And then meanwhile  And then they do it over and over again  After that  And he's continuing to try to do it  Yeah like how Rogan  You know  Always talks about those leg kicks  They're starting to wear them down  I've seen a few fights  Where you just keep hearing the slap  Yeah  Of the guy's shin  Against the dude's leg  And even  And those guys after like  Probably like 8  Is when they start to start leaning  Yeah  Every  I can never handle it  Unbelievable  I love that guy though man  Johnny  Johnny  Hi buddy  Oh my god  He's got a big bag of ice  On his leg now 
[02:43:30]  Yeah I have to  Only because  You know  I want to be able to walk today  Yes  I have to  You know  Yeah  Oh man  That's going to hurt  If I take my knee  Like you know  Remember when you were a kid  And you do the cannonball  Where you tuck your knees in  If I tuck my knee in  Why I couldn't just say  That I had to mention the cannonball  Like a faggot  If you tuck your knee in  It hurts  I can't tuck my leg  All the way in  That's only going to feel worse  As time goes on  Of course it is  And like tomorrow  After sleeping and waking up  It's just going to be 
[02:44:00]  I would guess by the end  He's icing it  But by the end of the show  Just sitting down  Yeah yeah  It's going to freeze up on you  Lock up a little bit  Icing it is smart though right  No  Not really  Opie  Doesn't help  Opie  What do you think Joe  What  What do you think  From where you were sitting  The guy's amazing  I had to shit so bad though  Through the entire interview  I couldn't focus  That's why I had to leave  My stomach hurts  This guy's talking about  Choking people down  On the ground  And I'm just like  My tummy  It was like  I gotta shit 
[02:44:30]  She asked that one question  It kind of went around  And around in a circle  And I heard you be like  Yeah yeah yeah  Fuck it  Yeah yeah fuck it  I gotta shit  I couldn't get it out  Did you see the kick  Yeah no I saw that  But what  I was trying to ask you  I don't think I was being clear  When I said  How did it  How did it hurt  I mean I know it hurt a lot  But what kind of pain is it  Is it shooting pain  Is it just like  Unbelievable aches  No it's  It's  It's your whole body  Says  Fall down  Get everything out of your system 
[02:45:00]  Vomit  Vomit  It's that tingly  I'm glad I walked to the bathroom  I really did have to piss  The whole interview  Because we didn't break  Before John came in  So I did have to pee  And I'm like  Let me just walk down and pee  And I splashed a little  I was fine  By the time I pissed  I thought it was okay  I want to see him do it to DeRosa  DeRosa would cry  You for some reason  Jim  You're built for pain  I think you get  Some sort of odd  Right  Pleasure out  If you feel closer  To the fighters  There's something  There's something  In it for you  This kid here  I'm telling you  His glasses  Just the whole thing  I just realized 
[02:45:30]  We were on the air  You told that shit story  Thinking we were just  Off the air  Yeah I don't care  I just thought we were  On a break  Joe just really  Just puts it out there  He doesn't give a shit  He's like  Oh is this on the air  Oh what  Why we all had headphones on  And we're talking  Into microphones  I wish it was better though  I blew Bailey J  What  Don't say anything guys  What do you want  To make everyone jealous  Look at Jimmy 
[02:46:00]  Keeping his legs moving  Yeah I am  I'm just fucking  I'm just moving my right leg  Here's what it is  When an athlete's training  Sometimes we take a few bumps  Am I right or wrong  We can't argue with you  He said the best thing  When you were growing  He said the best thing  To do was rub it out  He said but that's  Going to make it hurt worse  But that will get it out  Yeah like to rub on it  Oh  I rub it out every night  Deep tissue massage  Yeah probably right  He should have  Kicked it in your dick  I wonder if he really 
[02:46:30]  Would have kicked me  In my solar plexus  He might have  Knocked the wind out of me  He would have  You'd have been  I'll be afraid  That would kill me  Because he's a young guy  John's 24  And again  He's  I  He's to me  Much scarier  Than a guy like Anderson  Yeah  Because Anderson Silva  Probably kicks as hard  If not harder  I'd love to hurt  You go  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  But Anderson  All the wind knocked out of you  I couldn't take  But I knew better 
[02:47:00]  Than to take it there  Not that  I don't want to get  My fucking ribs broken  You took it with poise man  If I got hit like that  I'd literally sell  One of the three stooges  I'd be like  Oh  Oh  Oh  By far  That was the worst one  By far  Jesus Christ  And he did 15%  By far  What's his name  Only did  What did he say  10  Anderson Silva  Did about  We didn't have  Anderson because he speaks  Broken English  He speaks Portuguese  We didn't have as much  We had a good time with him  But not as much  It was more question and answer 
[02:47:30]  Instead of just hanging out  And goofing off  You should keep upping the percentage  To see what point we get  Where you actually puke  Alright I took 15  Your color  From John Jones  Gotta go 20  I literally  He's gonna puke  I was gonna vomit  Your system  Whatever happens to your system  Dude your color changed man  The color left your face  Oh yeah it was just white  You were kind of a whitish green  There was a green hue to you  But you do feel  Not closer to the fighters  Like I could do that  But to understand  Like the respect level  Goes so much farther  Through the roof  Absolutely  To take that fucking punishment 
[02:48:00]  From this guy  I just want to hug  Loyola Machida  Like what are you doing  Stay home  Fucking terrible  You guys do  Hurts  If anybody wants to do that  If you want to go to a baseball park  And have someone  Just don't hit me in the head  But throw a fastball  Let me just  Just throw it like at three quarters  Let me see if I can get around  That's boring to those guys  He wanted to kick you full  He wanted to kick you at least 50%  Nah he wouldn't  I don't think he would  I don't think he wanted to  To put me out of commission for good  But you know he's  He's one of those guys  Again he's  He's in fight mode man  He's fighting in a week  He's in fucking fight mode 
[02:48:30]  Yeah yeah  Jimmy's ice it  Yeah that's ice it  Or imagine a fastball pitcher  Just nailing one into your back  Dude I would rather have taken it  In the stomach  Than where you took it  No way  No way  I would have thrown up  I would have thrown up  No no I rather would have  Because I feel like  You can tense that up  You can exhale  The shit you can do  I mean I'm not saying  It wouldn't kill  I'm gonna tell Houdini that  I can't  But nothing fucking hurts  It's Charlie Horse  Beyond the balls  Nothing hurts like  Charlie Horse and the shit  Yeah  But it's simple 
[02:49:00]  But it's such a strong muscle  In your body  And I've been told  By a lot of massage therapists  I have great legs  I have very strong legs  He really has inexplicably  Mr. Olympian like midget legs  I don't understand  He really has shapely  In shape  It's the calf muscles  Dude my calves are fucking  They're terrific  I have beautiful calves  They're pretty amazing  They're a thing of beauty  Bowling pins  I can argue with you Jimmy  They're beautiful  Can I see  All your vices go from  Like the belt  The belt up  Like all  His awful shoulders  Like I just  Look at that

[02:51:30]  On to that  You know there's no carpet  In the warehouse  Yeah like clang  Like five guys  Came over to break it up  And immediately dropped  To their knees  And just couldn't even move  Paralyzed with fucking laughter  What were those fucking  Pants people had  In the 80's  The sweats by EB's  They were like that style  With the little line thing  The Joey Butterfuoco sweats  The Zubas or whatever  That looked like  They had like the zebra print  And shit like that  Is that what they were called  The Joey Butterfucos  Yeah  I just knew  Joey Butterfucos  And change porn

[03:01:00]  When he walked in a room  And he was so funny  And he was just  He was just  Figuring out what he did  You know what I mean  He was just figuring out  How to take that thing he did  In the restaurant  And put it on stage  You know what I mean  Yes  The thing he did off stage  Was coming on stage  And he was  You know  It's like the comedic  Lynn Bias  If anything  You know what I mean  Right  Like this guy was  Really getting ready  To  We were all getting ready 
[03:01:30]  To have work  For Patrice O'Neal  That's basically  What was getting ready to happen  He was figuring it all out  Right in front of our eyes  He was there man  Yeah I know  When Elephant in the Room  Came out  I was excited for him  And I was nervous  I was like  Is he going to make me  Look like a child  Because like  He was that  Like it was literally  What he was saying  I almost felt like  Once it was his to take  Once he just decided  He wanted it  That's the level  That's what I always told him  Yeah  Right right  I always told him  Like look around  Do you see anybody  As funny as you  Really 
[03:02:00]  Really  Jimmy said it last week  He could be funny  With anyone  You can't think of  One person  He wouldn't be  As funny  Or funnier  Like any  Any comic  You could put him  In the room with  Who's ever worked  And he would be  Comfortable being funny  With them  Yes  Yes  I mean we're all  Established guys here  Is any one of us  Does any one of us  Really want to follow the guy  Right  No  He used to hold court  He actually was so funny  He could get comedians  Who are always trying  To top people's stories 
[03:02:30]  To actually shut up  And become audience members  Yeah  Like that time he went at it  With the transvestite  Out in front of that  Oh god  I forgot about that  It was literally  Just some transvestite  Was coming down the street  And he was just in  One of those moods  Where he felt like  Fucking with somebody  And he fucked with this transvestite  And she immediately  Came right back at him  Said remember that line  She said  You got so many spaces  Between your teeth  Looks like your tongue's in jail  That's what  That's what started it  Jesus Christ  And he hit her  With shit just as big  Dude  And we just sat there  It was like 
[03:03:00]  It was a comedic version  You ever see that  That tape of Biggie  When he was just  Got in that rap battle  In the middle of  Like the purest form  Right  It was like the purest form  Of comedy  There was no security  There was no crowd  Like a crowd  Just developed  Around what the fuck  Was happening  And he just sat there  And you know  She hit him with  A couple of stock lines  And he like  Ali leaned on the ropes  Let the he she  Punch herself out  And then he just  Fucking destroyed her  And but it was  It was unbelievable  I remember uh  Just really in that moment 
[03:03:30]  Going this guy  Is like  This guy's  He is  Truly special  You know  You're really not  You're really not  Gonna see another one  That was a one off  Yeah  That was it  He's fucking  His ability  I showed my parents  My parents were up  Visiting this week  And I showed them  Elephant in the room  Cause they didn't know  Who Patrice was  They just knew  That he was  I had a friend  That passed  Or whatever  And uh  I showed it to him  My dad's a catholic  Church deacon  And my dad was  Red faced  And laughing hysterically  At Patrice going  Why can't  We have harassment day 
[03:04:00]  You know  Excuse me  I always wanted you  To know  Would you suck my dick  In the broom closet  Like the fact that  He can make a fucking  Man of the cloth  Laugh as hard as like  Bill or me  Or any  You know  Whatever  It's fucking  It's uncanny man  Uncanny ability  There was nothing better  Than seeing  Patrice meet somebody  For the first time  Who was like  Impressed with themselves  And they thought  They were on some  Level of accomplishment  I saw him one time  He made this fucking  White dude  50 year old guy  You could just tell 
[03:04:30]  He ran a company  Or something  And he just was  So used to running shit  As he sat in the crowd  He had this vibe  Like he was running it  Even though he was  At the show  Like you were  Performing for him  You know  Patrice got on stage  He just  He didn't have to  Meet the guy  Just sensed it  He made this guy  So fucking mad  I was actually  Standing behind the guy  And I could see  The anger in the back  Of his head  And his shoulders  You know Patrice  Had that laugh  When he was really  Getting you that  He enjoyed it  Sounded like a fucking trumpet  And he's just laughing  In this guy's face  And then he finally 
[03:05:00]  Said something like  You look like you  Want to fire me  But you can't  And that was the one  That just  Fucking  Leveled the room  And I'm so fucking  Sad about this show  I couldn't wait  For him to get big  Because I wanted to  See those TMZ guys  To try to fuck with him  At the airport  Like how much he  Would have enjoyed that  And destroyed him  And they would have  I just  It's just  It's the worst  Fucking thing ever  It's horrible  There's so many things  That are going to happen  That you would just love  To know what his take  Was going to be on it  Chris you helped him  Too in a weird way  Because when you were 
[03:05:30]  On the show  At K-Rock with us  And Patrice was in  And it kind of  Turned into an intervention  Because you were telling him  That you wanted him  For your show  And you know  He might have been  Hard to be  And you told him  Kind of with love  And that really  I think it changed him  It absolutely changed him  I love the guy  You know  He's just one of those guys  That the moment  He started getting  Out of his own way  That's exactly it  It was all going to  Open up for him  And that's what  Was happening  When I was on the show 
[03:06:00]  And by the way  What I did on the show  Is what I did  Every time I saw him  I was like  Money  You're funnier  Than everybody  Jesus  Embrace it  Come in  Smile  Don't worry  The white man  Is not going to  Beat your ass today  It's okay  You know  He loved putting  A spark to a bridge  Though  He loved putting  A spark to a bridge  Oh boy 
[03:06:30]  You could burn a bridge  Like that guy  Amazing  And it was fucking  Hilarious  But like  Oh so you just  Be like  What are you doing  Why  It's like cross it first  Then burn it  Right  Right  Right  Did he ever tell you  That story  When he went into CBS  Which was like  A notoriously cold room  During this era  It was like  He walked in  They had the lights low  Like that guy  Who ran that team  In the natural  You know  Like the fucking  Baseball owner  You would just go in there  Dude  Like already sweating  You'd start tap dancing  And they wouldn't  Give it up for anything  And he walked in there 
[03:07:00]  Maybe tap dance  For half a second  And right in the middle  Of the meeting  You know  You're pitching a show  To get a deal  There's an invisible  Bag of money  Sitting there  And he just says  Fuck it  And he starts  Looking at every  Executive there  And starts pointing  At everybody  You don't like me  You don't like me  And you don't like me  Just started trashing him  Unknown comic  And I was  I was laughing my ass off  And I'd be  Priest do you realize  That that story  Was on the other side  Of Hollywood  Before you even got  Back to your  Rented Dodge Neon  Why would you do that  And he's like  Man I don't give a fuck  I don't give a fuck 
[03:07:30]  Fuck I'm gonna sit there  And do 3,000 miles  To have you staring at me  Cause you got a disc  Audition for everybody  Hates Chris  Didn't know his lines  Like y'all don't want me  I was like  I was dying  To give him the part  Oh  Jesus  Can you imagine  Yeah  He was defensive sometimes  When he didn't need to be  Like  I think sometimes  He didn't understand  How much people  Would just love him  Or how much people  Enjoyed him  He knew he was so funny  But you know  Look everybody else  He's a comedian  He's fucking got  Major problems 
[03:08:00]  Like we all do  And I think he never  Understood that  Man people really  Will embrace you  And they don't mind  You're shitty  Cynical  Like you're  You're so funny  People will just love you  We used to joke about  The supreme confidence  That hacks have  You know what I mean  They just never  They never question  Their talent  They just never do  They never question  Their talent  They just always  They go on stage  With supreme confidence  In their fucking  Prolific mediocrity  Always coming out  With another special  Always feel like 
[03:08:30]  Yeah  America needs to hear this  And then you get a guy  Like Patrice  Where it's like  Dude  You talking to yourself  In the shower  Should be a fucking album  And you're trying  To get the dude off  The  I don't know man  That's  That's probably gonna  You know  It just fucking hurts  Cause he was about  To do it on his terms  Too  You know  We talk about  All the bridges he burned  But he was about  To do it on his terms  Finally  Yeah Chris  Oh sorry Chris  The other moral  Of the story is  You know  Despite  You know 
[03:09:00]  Biggie being  You know  So big  And heavy D  And all that  Hey  Fat's not good  Yeah  Right  Yep  Yeah  And just because  You're popular  And you  Get laid  It doesn't mean  You're healthy  God damn  I know  You know  Louie was saying  That  And live off  Of chicken wings  From the Chinese restaurant  Louie was saying  He's just pissed at himself  For not going over there  And saying  Hey  Asshole  What are you doing to yourself  I think people tried  To be honest with you  Yeah 
[03:09:30]  Patrice is smart enough  To know  Yeah they tried  He's not a dumb guy  He knew  But it's like anything else  When someone's drinking too much  Or smoking cigarettes  It's  Death is like an intangible  Far away thing  You know it's there  But it's not  Right  It's not like a gun pointed at you  Do you know  Last night somebody from England  A comedian from England  This is how much this guy's love  Flew all the way over here  On his own dime  To come to the funeral today  And he was telling this story  They were doing a TV taping  In London  So of course  Patrice doesn't give a fuck  He's treating this like  You know  Europe's Friday night videos  He doesn't give a shit  Right 
[03:10:00]  And for some reason  They had a book in the green room  I guess that was  It had a list of all these  Comedians  That were so far down the ladder  They didn't have a manager  Or an agent  They just had their phone number  Their home phone number  So Patrice instead of preparing  For his set  Starts calling these  Guys over in England  Called one guy up  They had a puppet  And he goes  Yeah how much  To book the puppet  I just want to get the puppet  I don't want to book you  He asked another guy  How much would it cost  To get you to just stop  Fucking hilarious 
[03:10:30]  Yeah so nobody was paying attention  To the taping  They were all gathering around  Patrice once again  Holding court  And everyone just laughing  Like call another one  Call another one  Just effortless  I've totally butchered that story  But no  That's him  That is him  Funny man  The same guy  It's Brendan Burns  Is he who you're talking about  English comedy  Yeah Brendan Burns  We were at the  We were doing the nasty show  In Montreal  And Brendan came over  To hang out backstage  And he was  He was going off  About English comedy  And how good the scene is  And Patrice just goes 
[03:11:00]  English comedy  Stinks  And did a ten minute  Just improv sketch  Of an English comedy club  And he's just going  Coming to the stage  Ian Eaglepuss  And he's just making up  These ridiculous things  Get the fuck out of here  You stink  Y'all are thirty years behind us  I was the king of England  When I went over there  It was so fucking funny man  Motherfucker  Yeah  And you're like  Wow I wish I had anything  In my act 
[03:11:30]  Half that fucking funny  And he just said that  All off the top of his  God damn head  For ten minutes  And that was  It was almost like  He didn't even write  That was the creepy thing  About Patrice  He didn't know  What was his material  That he wrote  Go with that  Go with that  I'm serious  No he didn't  He just  You don't think  He wrote it all right  It's like Jay-Z  Jay-Z  Jay-Z  I heard he just  All in his fucking head  The same thing  I've known him  Twenty years  Never saw him go  Hey  I gotta go into CBS  And get a notebook  Right  Never saw him  With a laptop  I don't care what he says 
[03:12:00]  Yeah  There were so many times  On the radio show  We would say  Please save that for the air  That's amazing  He couldn't stop  We'd go to break  And he was just as funny  Just hanging out  Oh yeah  Yeah  I haven't seen Elephant  In the room  Because I don't watch stuff  You just don't want to see  What the guys you know  Are doing  It really is fucking good  I watched a clip  A clip about being mean to animals  And it was like  God fucking body  Was it great  Yeah he nailed it  You never want to understand  That your peer  Is so great  Like you know what I mean  Nobody recognizes 
[03:12:30]  That they're working  With such greatness  And it's like  When someone dies  Then you reflect  Right  But while you're seeing it  You don't realize  It's like god damn  He's got a CD coming out  Called Mr. P  Mr. P  That he was putting together  This isn't one of those things  Where the family rushed out  Because you know he died  Oh no he was responsible for it  This is something he wanted out there  And yeah  They're taking pre-orders now  And Jonathan said the other day  It's brilliant  This thing Mr. P is brilliant  Yeah and it's available on iTunes  And Amazon now for pre-order  If you guys want to go out  And get it  And the money's going to the family  Yeah the CD company 
[03:13:00]  Actually switched the deal  To give his family more money  They're taking a lower percentage  Yep  Hey was anybody else  On that benefit  We did that one time  For the rescue dogs  No  Was that a Steinberg gig  We did this gig  And it was like  We show up  You figure it's for rescue dogs  We're working for free  Everyone's going to be  Paying attention  It was this Manhattan  Just who's who shit  And nobody was paying attention  The only two people  Paying attention  Were two cast members  Of a queer eye  For the straight guy  This was like fucking  Eight years ago  And so I go up first  And like an idiot  I go right into my act 
[03:13:30]  And I just immediately  Start bombing  Nobody's paying attention  To me  I'm working for free  And all I can hear  Is Patrice laughing  Oh shit  At the back of the fucking thing  Right  Each one of us  Tried to adjust  Somehow to kill  And none of us could  We all ate our balls  And then Patrice went up there  And opened with  Talking about how  He had a puppy for breakfast  And went through  The whole preparation of it  And just pissed everybody off  In the room  And then right when  He had everybody listening  He just trashed  Everybody in the room  And this whole thing 
[03:14:00]  So the lady who ran the event  With her  I run shit  Fucking dress she had on  Was telling him  She goes  She told him to get off the stage  And he's just going  And he's going  No I'm not getting upset  She goes  She goes  I put this thing together  He goes  Bitch I don't give a fuck  And he just kept going  Oh man  No he wouldn't get off the stage  And then they turned off  The microphone  No  And there was a piano on stage  So he sits down  At the piano  And starts playing the piano  Which he can't  And I remember  He's just sitting there  Banging it  And as she's yelling at him 
[03:14:30]  He just looked over  The impish smile ever  Just looking over smiling  And I was just  So fucking happy  He did it  And I was so mad  That I didn't think  To fucking  I went up there  Like a hat in hand  Hey my dad's wacky  And just ate my balls  It was  It was  I mean  I  Prepare a puppy  That's brilliant  He was one of those  Friends  One of those comedians  Who could be your fucking hero  In any given moment  By doing something like that  Like god damn it  I love the fact  That he fucking had the balls  He was  He was very  He was impossible 
[03:15:00]  To own Patrice  Because there's nothing  You could dangle in his face  That he couldn't walk away from  Like he literally  Obviously  Could not be controlled  You remember when the seller  Tried to kick him out  The seller kicked him out  And then we all  He hung around the corner  So we would all  Do our sets  And then leave  Because we wanted  To hang around with him  Wait a minute  Why did the seller kick him out  He had an argument with Manny  I think  But it was  It was  It was  It was a mistake  It was a misunderstanding  I watched it happen  And Manny mistook  Patrice was asking him 
[03:15:30]  If he had false teeth  And we  But like  We would tease each other  All the time there  And he was  It was getting  I think that was something  Manny was sensitive about  Because he was 70  And it was one of the only things  I guess  That was like his Achilles  And Patrice really didn't know  Oh yeah yeah  I wouldn't say anything bad  About this  I got kicked out for a minute  Everybody at some point  You know  You're late  Or whatever  You do whatever  And then they got to  Throw down the gauntlet  So  I think he didn't want  To come back  I'm saying  I think that like  He just said  Fuck this  I'm not going back 
[03:16:00]  And he just didn't  Want to go back  Well all I know is  So now we would just  All go hang where he was at  So then they had to  Let him back in  You just  You couldn't beat him  Oh so  Because everybody was  Leaving the club  Because we were all going to leave  Yeah  And then you know  They want people hanging around  Or whatever  So they had to let him back in  And then he figured that out  Going that was kind of  Golden handcuffs  That they let me back in  So then what he did was  He was back in  But he wouldn't put in for spots  And would just go down there  And hang out  It was always chess with him  Oh yeah  It was awesome  You gotta respect that though man  Yeah  He was at Caroline's one night 
[03:16:30]  And there was a work  Like a Christmas party there  Fucking 25 people  And their female boss  So of course  Like you're waiting for it  You're like  When's he gonna attack the boss  And finally  He gets around to it  And he goes  Let me tell y'all  How she likes to get fucked  You go  See how she wear her hair  Up in that bun  She likes to let that shit down  She likes a dude  To wrap that shit around  His fist  Five, six times  And pull her head down  Like a horse  And go  Bitch 
[03:17:00]  Shut the fuck up  Fucking  All of her employees  Are laughing at her  She's staring at Patrice  Dude  Like venom  And Patrice just goes  Bitch  Don't give me boss eyes  I don't work for you  Fucking maniac  That's fantastic  Gonna fucking miss him man  Yeah  Obviously  God damn  Want to thank Chris  For calling in  Yeah Chris  Thanks man  Thanks for having me 
[03:17:30]  I'm sure I'll see you guys  Tonight  Unfortunately  Yeah  Bummer  Well you know  What the fuck are you gonna do  Yeah  That's the easy way  Chris is in great shape  So we're good there  Yeah  I'm in decent shape  Let's work on a towel  He won't stop smoking  I feel like a fucking nudge ant  Every time I see him  I want to just go stop  Because he quit drinking  He's doing good  He looks okay  But fucking he won't stop smoking  Yeah  It's like will you stop  Fucking stop it 
[03:18:00]  I need one vice  Yeah he smokes a lot  He smokes a lot  Maybe that's what we do next week  We just pick out a few guys  To you know  Guys yeah  Even though people did say something  Patrice  We always feel like we could have said more  But again he knew  He was the smartest guy in the room  I mean he always knew  Can't be with him 24 hours either  Yeah  He was gonna make his own decisions  And it's unfortunate  They said even look  With diabetes  Even if you're totally thin  And you jog  It can happen  But by overeating and stuff  And you just fucking put the 
[03:18:30]  Odds through the roof  Yeah man  You make it much worse  See you tonight brother  It was good talking to you  Alright thanks a lot  Alright Chris  Thank you Chris  Bye Chris  Chris Rock everyone  Yeah that really did help Patrice  I think when Chris  That day he was in  Because it got to him  Because Chris wasn't coming at him  Like you asshole  He was like  I wanted to give you  It was extremely real  Remember  Yeah  And I think  We were like whoa  And I think Patrice realized it  And Patrice listened too  You know what  One of the only times  You've watched Patrice  Actually sit back and listen  Instead of coming back  With something  He would do that 
[03:19:00]  On rare occasions  When  And it was always  When someone was  Being brutally honest  With him  He would actually  Stop talking  And making fun of you  For half a second  But  Yeah  Yeah it's terrible  And it's  You know  Look  Everybody always  Says too soon  When somebody dies  It's a cliche thing to say  But with Patrice  I've just never seen it  More applicable  This was such  You know  I  Geraldo was the first guy  I knew in this business 
[03:19:30]  To go  And it was very upsetting  But Patrice was the first  I mean I was friends with Greg  But Patrice was the first guy  That I was really like  Holy shit  Like  This can happen man  Like it can  You can go before  Even though you're loved  And respected  And have so much to say  And are such a presence  You can go  At any fucking time  It's  It's really scary man  And it's so upsetting  Because you know  There was like  Seven more of those specials  Welcome to middle age Joe  Yeah  No kidding  Middle age is when you realize  That life doesn't give a shit  That it just  It doesn't 
[03:20:00]  You know  It's upsetting  Because he was young  But it's also  Like you're saying  Upsetting  Knowing what he was about to do  Yeah  With his career  It was like  You know  On both levels  It just  Just sucks  Yeah  I so wanted to see that guy  Go to that  It was going to be  A whole new group of people  Who are going to meet him  For the first time  Which I tell you  I can't stress that enough  Watching somebody meet that guy  When he was in that fucking mood  Which he usually was  Yeah  I just love how he used to pick out  I remember one time  This beautiful girl came in  And she had this little scar 
[03:20:30]  You could barely fucking see it  Oh that motherfucker  He went right for it  Yeah  That's how you doing  I like that scar you got right there  Right  And then immediately  She's just all fucking uncomfortable  And he just brought it  To this fucking real place  That she  You know  Hadn't probably been in since  You know  I don't know what  And he just  I don't know  Did I tell that story  About him talking  And telling that girl  To shut up  That could be  That could be a thousand stories  Was that at the cellar or no?  That time we were at the cellar  And those girls were all talking 
[03:21:00]  I think I told that  When I called in  I'll tell it again  Who gives a fuck  It don't matter  It's a loud bar  And you know  When their voices go up  It gets fucking  And he just goes  They sit there talking  Like  And he keeps glancing over there  As he's trying to talk to me  And then he did that glance  For an extra second  I'm like  Oh fuck  He's gonna say something  He's on  He's going  And he just picked out one  And he just goes  Ma'am  Miss  Ma'am  And she finally looks  And she goes  What?  And he goes  Your voice  And she goes  She goes  Is it loud? 
[03:21:30]  And he goes  It's piercing  And he just starts  And just basically  Tells her to shut up  So then  These girls are fucking gorgeous too  So her two friends  Want to come to her rescue  So all three of them  Come over to Patrice  I'm like  Oh fuck  How the hell  Is he gonna deal with this?  And I don't know  What he did  Within 30 seconds  He had them auditioning  To figure out  Who had the best  Sexy phone sex voice  Holy shit  And they were auditioning for him  And he was sitting there judging  And telling each one of them  Why  Despite their looks  Guys didn't find him attractive 
[03:22:00]  After like a third date  And he was so in there  It was Hannibal Lecter  He was in their fucking heads  Hannibal Lecter  It was awesome  He was a psychologist  He really was a brilliant  Brilliant intuitive  Fucking psychologist  He just under  He read people  Immediately  I know exactly the way  When you describe that  How it went  Your voice  Yeah  Like he would just do that  Your voice  Your voice  What was better than him  Shushing people  What was funnier than that  Oh shh  He used to do that  He used to do that 
[03:22:30]  On the subway  It would be on the subway  And it would be jam packed  With people  And he'd just go  And shh  And everyone would shut up  For half a second  And then he would just  Start laughing  People would get so  Fucking mad  And he was the one  That brought that  To the circle  Right  Him and Keith Robinson  I've never heard that  Before  His shush is so loud  And he could do it so loud  He could do it in bars  And everybody would shut up  And they all would look around  Like where did that come from  They don't realize  Why they're being shushed  And you keep hearing people  Start going  Who keeps doing that 
[03:23:00]  Dude I would beg him  To do it at the cellar  Because from the back of the room  I would just shush everybody  It was like asking someone  To sing your favorite song  And he would finally shush  And the whole fucking restaurant  Would go silent  And he'd be like  Why the fuck did we stop talking  Who is that  Dude it's like  You got something on your shirt  Like the person would fall for it  Every fucking time  That's so fucking funny  I think one time  I was going out to his house  In Jersey  We were way back in the day  You know  We were struggling  We were on the fucking path trade  He did it like fucking nine times 
[03:23:30]  To the point  I was embarrassed  Going please stop doing this  Sorry  You never say that to him  No  He's going to just do it in war  No and then I think  The entertainment was  Him watching me be so fucking  Uncomfortable  Uncomfortable  Yeah  And he could diffuse  Almost anything too  Like even though he was a big guy  He was so fucking  He just had that light man  He was so fucking charismatic  He could diffuse  Any type of aggression  He just knew how to  Fucking let the air out  And make people  Manny had the same ability  Manny Dwarman 
[03:24:00]  No matter how heated it got  In a second  He could diffuse it  Almost at will  You know something  That's what I loved about  Manny the best  Is because I came from  That stupid Irish  You get into a fight  And then you hold on to it  For fucking nine years  He had that thing  He could actually  Just make it be like that  He'd come over you  Hey  And you'd just see that  Manny laugh  And you'd just start  Fucking laughing  And then you'd start thinking  This is how we should have done  In my family  Yeah yeah yeah  Me and Manny  Had a fight one time  One of our rare fights  A real argument  I might have told this story already  But Manny 
[03:24:30]  I didn't go into the cellar  For 40 days  I stayed out for over a month  I was so fucking mad at him  And he was mad at me  And I finally went back in  Because I just missed it  And he and I  Walked by each other  And we just kind of  Looked at each other  And said hello  Hello  And then we were  In the back  And it was very tense  When he was at the table  With me  And he said  He said I have some  Pictures of you  That I want to give you  That I took  And I'm like okay thanks  And he goes  Let me go get them  Out of the garbage  Immediately  Immediately  Everything was okay 
[03:25:00]  He made me laugh  That's funny  Immediately  He fucking just  Took the air out of the way  That was another one  That was another rough one  Manny was terrible  Manny was the  And you know what I loved  About Manny  Manny fucking  He loved  He loved people  Like he loved the debate  Like he loved sitting there  And like  So he didn't want  To be mad at you  Yeah  You know what I mean  Like I learned a lot  About not being an angry psycho  Just through that guy  Like how he had that ability  And interestingly enough  Bobby Kelly  Living with Bobby Kelly 
[03:25:30]  Bobby's really good at that  After you have this  Epic  I'm gonna choke  Yeah  Really  Choke you to death  That he can actually  You know  Yeah he starts going  Listen dude  Bro  And all that shit  And he's like  Get this fucking idiot  I can't be mad at him  Yeah and Bobby  Bobby does the great thing too  Where he'll go  He'll be like  It's okay dude  I'm sorry I snapped at you  Right  And then like  He'll be talking to you  He'll go  He'll go  I mean you know  Nobody's gotta think about  That you got all this  Fucked up shit that you do  And it really pisses everybody off  Or whatever  Like he'll slip it in

[03:31:00]  And you didn't hear  The whole conversation  Who said that  You're repeating it  Drew Brees  Is  He's the old stuff  Alright  I thought that was  Going to be  What's the matter Joe  You tired of being  Left out of the conversation  He just wanted to do  Yeah  I kind of like  It's really mean  But really true  And funny  The eyes get  Laugh and it hurts  The eyes get real squinty  Yeah  And he doesn't look at you  He looks like  Oh it's not a Joe  This one too  Jesus Joe  Jesus 
[03:31:30]  Nice long Jesus  But just a fucking  You gotta sit like that  Jesus Joe  Can't tell if you're doing  Me or an 80  80 year old  Fucking  Vaudeville guy  I did  Vaudeville guy  I really didn't have  The reference  I was trying to think  What the hell  Poughkeepsie  Where the fuck  Did all those  Old Jewish guys go  Oh catskills  Catskills  Old vaudeville guy  I wanted to ask you  When you were telling  That Patrice story  About the  You know  The animal thing  And you said  You wish you did that 
[03:32:00]  Was that before  The Philly thing  Yeah  Because you had your moment  Where you  You turned it  In Philly  Oh yeah  I mean look  It's not like I hadn't  Snapped on crowds  But I was so  Like  It was different  It was a benefit  And I was sitting there  And there was  There was some people there  Somebody from NBC  Was there  So I was in this  So you felt like  You know what  Even if I want to  I just can't  I have to be a professional  And I felt like  It was  I made  I basically 
[03:32:30]  Kept giving them  Respect  When they were  Showing me none  So I  It was one of the  Worst feelings  Now I understand  That's  What you just said  It's not about  You thought there was  Way too  The people were  Way too important  In the audience  To fuck around  Cast from TV shows  Were there  Everyone was dressed up  This was  I didn't have  Any sort of agent  Going  Maybe somebody  From CAA  Is here  I was in that  Stupid  Give me a deal  It was a great story  But I was confused  Because I'm like  Nah Bill would  Fucking do that  But now I get it  Patrice addressed it  The way 
[03:33:00]  You wished you had  Addressed it as a comic  Like ah he was being  Yeah I've been there too  And also I grew into that  Like Patrice came in  Like that  He came in like that  He actually had to  Tone it down  And remember to do material  Standard equipment  They should like you  Yeah  No he from day one  Doing stand up  Was already there  It took me  It took me years  And you know  Obviously getting to see  A guy his caliber  It was  You know  Ah it's the worst  Saddest fucking day ever  We've talked about 
[03:33:30]  His big dumb laugh  But anybody  That thinks Patrice was mean  When you made him laugh  Like that  Like you  You really felt  Like a funny person  Oh yeah  It was like  When he fucking let go  Like that's the guy  I think of  When I think of Patrice  Not mean  And people have had  Horrible experiences with him  Because he  He was at times  Believe me  There's a lot of people  Not sad today  I said there's as many  Happy as sad  Yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  Because he was mean  To certain comics  Unnecessarily  And you know  Look at one point  He went back  And started apologizing  To guys  Because he felt bad  About the interactions  He had had  Like he has a conscience  But he gave you respect man 
[03:34:00]  You know  He gave you that  Over the top laugh  Saying fuck that was funny  Something was funny  Yeah yeah  I think one of the hardest  I saw anybody make him laugh  Was the time  Voss did that bit  Hey you know  What time is it  There was this Asian guy  Walking down the street  Like you know  He's in the middle of moving  And he had all these boxes  And the joke is  You basically go  Hey what time is it  And as the guy  Looks down at the watch  You walk away  Sure  And just the look of exasperation  Because the guy  Had to adjust the weight  Of the box is like  I thought Patrice  Was going to fall down  Was that in front of Boston  The Boston  Remember that  And he was  He like  He actually started running 
[03:34:30]  He was laughing so hard  He can imagine  Trying to run away  From the laugh  He ran like  From his own laugh  And like leaned on this car  And was laughing so hard  And the laugh was so great  I remember thinking  Like I wish I  Could make him laugh that hard  Because that is like  And then it was  You know  It was out there in the streets  It was echoing off the buildings  It was just  It just was fucking  It was awesome  Yeah anytime you made him laugh  It was just fucking gold  It's like oh man  Okay good  Patrice is laughing  Fuck  I can be funny at some point  The impish smile too  You're right  That impish dude 
[03:35:00]  Was that fucking  That weird like  I know I'm being naughty  Fucking smile  He knew exactly  What he was doing  Yeah  At all fucking times  And his disdain for authority  I fucking  Fantastic  I loved it  Yeah  I fuck  I remember one time  We used to drive down to New York  In my piece of shit truck  I had this 83 Ford Ranger  Vinyl seats  You know  We leaned all the way  To one side  Because he's like  I could barely shift a thing  Right  And I remember  We got pulled over  By the cops  And I'm just typical white guy  I'm like  I was speeding 
[03:35:30]  He got me  Fuck it  And I'm sitting there  Next to him  And the guy comes to the window  I just see  I can feel Patrice  Staring a hole through this guy  To the point  I'm like  I'm gonna get this shit  Kicked out of me  Because of you  I was speeding  The speed limit  Was fucking 55  I was doing 75  Stop staring at this guy  And Patrice goes  He had like  This whole coat of armor  It's the way  It's the way  He's talking to you right now  I fucking hate these cops  And then it became  This whole topic of race  On the way down  That I don't get it  And I was just like  Dude you know  They're kind of dicks to us too 
[03:36:00]  Yeah yeah  And they also have to  Come up to the car  And be worried  That they're not gonna get shot  So they have to have  So I was obviously  Taking the cop side  And it was just like  I remember  I had no saliva  Left in my mouth  By like five  You know  You could just out debate you  I think  We just  Stop talking  By the time we got there  But we had this one moment  On the trip  That we always got  A big kick out of  There's this tunnel  That you go through  On the Merritt Parkway  And we used to always joke  That it was this  James Bond  Kind of tunnel  So one time  We were going down there 
[03:36:30]  Through there  And he actually brought  The James Bond  Soundtrack cassette  This is how long it is  And he popped it in  And right as we go  On the tunnel  I was like  And we were driving through  And then when it went  We both looked at each other  And we were in a spine  And then it became like  It became this fucking tradition  Every time we drove down  We'd be in the middle of talking  We both knew we were going to do it  Oh it's great  Nobody said anything  And then we would  One time we were driving down  With Bobby Kelly  And that was the best  Because he had no idea  And we were sitting there talking  And you know  Patrice  These motherfuckers  And we got to the bridge 
[03:37:00]  And then we go  Shut up Bob  We popped it in  And it starts going  Down down down  And Bob  Just starts doing that  High pitch laugh  What the fuck  And then we just looked  At each other  Came out the other side  And it was  Bobby laughed  For like 10 miles  It was fucking  He told me that story  It was awesome  It was fucking  We had so many  So many great times man  He told me about you guys  Doing that recently  And he was telling me  And he goes  He goes dude  They would drive through the tunnel  Dude  And as soon as they hit the tunnel  They'd go  And I go  What the fuck are you talking 
[03:37:30]  What are you singing  And he goes  James Bond dude  No we had it down  And right where it would go  We'd both look at each other  You gotta look at each other  And then when it was  It was like  We'd look away  Back  That's fucking cool  That's hilarious  That's awesome  Like a movie  Yeah  And when Bobby saw it  Dude I'm telling you  He laughed  For fucking 10 miles  Going what the fuck  Is wrong with you guys  And it was  It was awesome  And then we went down  To New York  And me and Bobby  Felt like little kids  And Patrice just walked in 
[03:38:00]  And immediately started  Trashing the club owners  And I was just  And I remember thinking  Like how does he think  He's gonna get in  Doing this  And then he would  Because he just had the  He would literally  De-pants these guys  And they were just like  They're so used to being like  Everybody just groveling  And Patrice would just come in  And just you know  Bring them down to bedrock  You can back any shit up  With charm and charisma  Which is fucking  Like no one has both  Of those things  Where you can be  An utter prick 
[03:38:30]  And then be charming  Yeah well  We have the prick part  But that charming part  We're all a little lacking  Ah we're working on it  But he was funny  He was almost funny at will  And that was what  Got him out of it  Was because  You couldn't argue  That this guy  Is not hilarious  Like everyone  You couldn't  Uncomfortable situations  He could make people laugh  And all the time  Like just  Start trashing somebody  Where nobody knows him  He didn't care  He didn't give a fuck  And then people would listen  And start laughing  I saw him  He trashed one time 
[03:39:00]  We were at Montreal Comedy Festival  And the original star  Of Law and Order  Really well respected actor  He passed away  He came walking up  And I was like  All in awe  And Patrice started making fun  Of his fucking raincoat  And the guy loved it  He just  Like he immediately  Was it that Orbach guy?  Yeah  The old guy right?  Yeah yeah yeah  Jerry  I think it's Jerry  Yeah and that was the thing  Like when people  Immediately got Patrice  Like that was  That was another  Like a whole nother level  Yeah yeah  Because then you immediately  Said oh I bet  This guy breaks balls too  Like he totally 
[03:39:30]  He didn't have like  That vibe like  I'm the star of a TV show  He immediately thought  It was fucking funny  And then I  Then Patrice had that thing  That like that's how  People didn't realize  That's how you got to him  That if you actually  Could laugh at a trash  And then you'd get  That side of Patrice  Where he showed you  What a big hearted guy he was  Yeah yeah yeah  God damn  And it just gets sadder  By each story  It really does  Fucking horrible  There was some wonderful  Savage beatings  Some fucking verbal beatings  And we've all been on 
[03:40:00]  The receiving end of them  And I don't think  I ever got over that  That bus beating  About taking the bus  You know and Kevin  And them came in  And told that story  And this is what  I never told  Because I was sworn  To secrecy  I got  After that trashing  I was still going  To do the gig  Because in my world  It was an easy gig  Just to tell the listeners  Basically you had to  Stand up on a bus  On a bus  To Yankee Stadium  And they pay you  Like 500 bucks  And you get a free  World Series ticket  And they were all  Braves fans  So I'm like  That's the easiest  Fucking gig ever  All I got to do  Is just stand there  Every time I have a problem  I go 
[03:40:30]  Jeter sucks  Or hey look at the  Tits on her  And I would be fine  But they pounded me  So bad  For 45 minutes  I was still going  To do it  Because I didn't  Give a fuck  But in the end  Patrice said  He said  Bill  You're a friend  He goes  I can't let you  Do that  He goes  I will stand  In front of that bus  Before I let you  Do that  He goes  You make enough money  Just buy a fucking  Ticket  If you want to go  And I just remember  That going like  I should really have  Some sort of  Respect for myself  And that's what  Made me stop  And then I 
[03:41:00]  This is where  I was sworn to secrecy  Is I passed that  Gig on to somebody else  And they did the gig  I'll let them tell it  If they ever come on  This show  And I asked them  The next day  I go  I go  How was the game  He goes  Oh it was fucking awesome  And I go  How was the gig  He goes  Dude it was brutal  I'm not going to lie  He goes  I ran out of shit  We hit traffic  Oh no  Oh shit  Traffic  I didn't take into consideration  There was going to be traffic  Going to a World Series game  At the Bronx  You had to perform  For the whole ride  No matter how long  The ride lasted 
[03:41:30]  It wasn't like  You're on 10  I don't think  Patrice was ever  Was ever funnier  He said  He goes  So when they bring you up  Are you going to come out  Of the bathroom  Or he goes  Are you going to walk up  Those little stairs  One of my favorite ones  He said  He goes  He was doing an impression  Of me  After  At the end of the  End of the gig  I was going to be  Standing up  Going like  This is going to be a visual joke  But you know  Thanks a lot everybody  You guys have been great  And then I sit down  And then I sit down  With my back to the crowd  And as they all get off 
[03:42:00]  I'm looking over my shoulder  Going  Oh thanks a lot  Thanks a lot  Thanks a lot  And it was just  One of those things  It was the easiest thing  To trash somebody for  And then all the fucking  Mount Rushmore people  Of trashing  Norton was there  Voss was there  Keith was there  Patrice and Little Kev  Oh shit  Dude and two of them  I never  I never  They literally did  A headlining set  And it was one of those  Awful nights at the cellar  Where there was only  It was like  Like a third full  So there was 
[03:42:30]  People who didn't even know me  Were hearing it  And they were either laughing  One girl looked at me  And she went  Oh  Like she saw me  Dude and I just was  Sitting at the bar  Shifting my weight  And all I wanted to do  From 30 seconds in  Was run out of there  And I just  I couldn't  I had to sit  Because that's the rules  I had to sit there  And take it through  And every time I thought  It was going to end  Somebody else would just  Come back with something else  And it just  Dude  I'm telling you  That one  The Eddie Ift  Oh my god 
[03:43:00]  That was one  Were you there for that  Was when Patrice  A comedian Eddie Ift  Who was a funny guy  But Patrice killed him one time  They argued about something  And it was so bad  Me and Vos were there  And like literally  We didn't even  You just wanted to jump in  On a teasing  We couldn't even jump in  On a teasing  It was  It felt abusive  Almost  To jump in  Wow  Somebody jumped in  That we need to call him  To make sure he's okay  Eddie I actually  Out of everything we said  Summed up Patrice  In a great way  One time he goes  Sometimes I would walk  Into the cellar  And I would just think  Fuck  He saw me 
[03:43:30]  Which I thought was exact  Because I used to feel that  I used to feel that  Like you would come  Walking in  And you would literally  Like dude  Before you'd walk in  You'd look at your clothes  Going okay  Is everything straight  It's my head  It's my hair messed up  They're gonna fucking rail me  About this one really bad  I have closets full of clothes  That got retired  From the trashing  And I gotta be honest dude  Like as much as I do  That shit on stage  I'm not that guy off stage  Like Norton and those guys  Really were those guys  And I used to  Nice shirt  I used to really 
[03:44:00]  He'd take a fucking  Pounding down there  He was trashing  Some guy's hoodie  One night  I forget who the comic was  We were in front of the cellar  And Patrice was trashing  His hoodie so bad  And he's going  Look at this nigga's hoodie  Look at this nigga's hoodie  Right  And he goes  Take that shit off man  Take that fucking hoodie off  And the dude unzipped it  And he was wearing like  A spandex shirt  Underneath  And he goes  Put it the fuck back on  Put it back on man  And it was like  It was like so  It was so fucking fast  And so insulting 
[03:44:30]  Like boom boom boom boom  We were laughing so fucking hard  I love what he used to call  Like older white people  The n-word  When he was mad at them  And he would talk to them  Like it was some dude  On the street  And they  So he would be coming at them  Like 40 different ways  That they did not handle  You could only see  Their clothes moving  And the pounding  That they were taking  From the guy  And totally man  I never said that dude  Now that everybody's  Fucking dropping  Outmost respect  For like the quickness  Norton has  And all those guys  Man they're just fucking  Really  One of my best laughs 
[03:45:00]  I ever had  Was on this show  When you called somebody  A zilch  And I literally  The way he said it  I swear to god  Like three weeks later  I was eating like  Raisin bran  And the shit  Came out of my nose  I don't know why  I was thinking it  I think because you were  Eating like a breakfast sandwich  I was eating breakfast  Some sort of  Fucked up connection  I was sitting there  And I was eating  Fucking something  I just saw  He went on  One of those  Norton rants  Fucking zilch  Shit just came  Out of my nose  So  Thanks man  I don't know  Seriously dude 
[03:45:30]  It was the most  Moving up to the city  With you guys  Already being  It was one of the  Most intimidating things  You could ever do  Because you walk  Into the  You know  You come from the  Open mic scene  In Philly  And you  All of a sudden  You're like  It's your first night  In New York  You walk into the cellar  It's Norton  Burr  Patrice  Bobby  Voss  DePaulo  Keith  Giraldo  DePaulo  I forgot DePaulo  And you're just like  You know  It's that  We're not in Kansas  Moment  Not to use a cliche  But I mean  It's like  You know 
[03:46:00]  And just watching  That you're just like  I better shut  The fuck  Yeah  Don't talk  I gotta tell you something  The amount of comics  Who came down there  And took one ass beating  And just hit out  Up at the strip  And the fucking  Stand up New York  For the rest of their time there  And just never fucking came back  Never came back down  Dude  Like it was  A serious  Caning  And the thing is  You never really got  Beaten into the gang  It just  It just  Continued to happen  I remember nights  Even Keith  Remember that night 
[03:46:30]  Keith was wearing something  And somebody got him  With something so funny  He literally stood up  That's how I got the idea  He literally stood up  And ran out of there  And I remember thinking  About that  Bust pounding  Going  Why the fuck  Didn't I ever think  Did you just run out  Why didn't I just sit here  And take it  Sometimes you gotta just leave  Like when you feel  The roll starting  And you gotta go  You're like  I bailed a few  No way  Right  Yeah  But the worst is when  Like Artie  Artie will like  They got smart  The guy's trying to run out  And they'll block you  Like you'll try to dash  Out of the fucking spot  Where the fuck are you going 
[03:47:00]  Sit there and take  Your fucking pounding  Oh  Who got me mad  One time  I came  I was when I was  Opened for Dice  It was probably  99 or 2000  And I was at the cellar  And they were killing me  Probably for opening  For dinner  You know  Or whatever  Oh yeah  Yeah  Patrice  Patrice was killing you  What was he saying  I don't remember  Oh he was saying  How much of a lackey  Norton was  To fucking Dice  So he started  Imitating Dice  Calling Jim up  Going  Hey let's go to the mall  Oh  And it was 
[03:47:30]  Dude  Fucking pounding  The tail  Dude that was a great  Smashing  And I was  I was overtired  Because I used to fly home  In the morning  And land at like 6pm  And then go right to the cellar  And uh  Because it was before  Obviously the morning radio  And I'm sitting there  I think it was Patrice  That pulled my chair out  And I was like  Don't touch my fucking chair  Like that's when I decided  To get indicted and angry  Now you're standing  I made it real  Don't touch my fucking chair  And that just made  The pounding worse  It just made my beating worse  And I had to take it  Jesus 
[03:48:00]  Dude I remember like times  Of like trying to sneak out of there  And you just  Literally  Keith would be like  Where you going Burr  You got nowhere to go  Sit down  You got nowhere to go  And then you'd be like an idiot  Trying to make something up  I got it  You got an audition  For what stupid  You're not getting it  Nobody cares  Shut the fuck up  Fucking brutal  Sometimes when you're getting  Beat up it was fun though  Like I literally have been  Killed by those guys  And you're thinking like  It is fun  Because I know I'm loved here 
[03:48:30]  And I'm getting pounded  By some of the funniest  Fucking guys in the country  It was kind of  A weird thing to enjoy  Like even when you  Were getting killed  I got upset a lot  He only got upset  A couple of times  But I don't remember  Like he was always good nature  Every time Jim was playing chess  With Bobby  Bobby's on the phone too  And fucking  Patrice was just being  Just fucking with Norton  And he goes  He goes  Jim what would you do  If I punched you  What would you do  If I punched you  Right in this chin  Right here  And he just started  And he just started  I don't know 
[03:49:00]  I just watched  In the way Jim was laughing  I literally learned  From you guys  Because I came from  Such an angry background  Where it wasn't done  With any sort of love  That's why  I sucked at that game  Because I didn't take it  Love and then I also  Went right for your jug  I was the guy  Yeah at least my mom  Didn't die  That's how I initially  Played it  So it took me  Just took everyone out of it  Wrecked the whole thing  Yeah  The whole fucking  Bobby was like that too  But Bobby had a way  Of saving it  Where Bobby would go  For the jugular  And then everybody  Would be like 
[03:49:30]  Jesus Christ  And just go  Bob Kelly  Bobby's on the line  I actually butchered it  Sorry  Bobby  Bobby  Hey what's up guys  How you doing Bob  Bobby  I was at that pounding  To bus bill  Are you waiting for that one  I'm sorry  I was going to come up  To the front  The yellow line  And that's the stage  The yellow line  I don't know Bob  I got to admit  It was all kind of a blur  You know  I still have brain damage  From that one  That was one of the  We went over it one night 
[03:50:00]  I remember Patricia  At the cellar  And it's so funny  That he got kicked  Out of the cellar  And then back in  And then he just  Refused to play it  Dude I heard  I didn't  I wasn't there  For this one  But one  An epic one  Bobby got off easy  Because it was overseas  So none of us saw us  There was something  In Amsterdam  About a hotel room  You guys went over  To do a gig over there  Was you Keith and Patrice  Well I  You know  Yeah it was Keith  And Patrice  And me  And it was  They put us  They tried to put us  In this  You know  Boutique hotel 
[03:50:30]  Right in the  Red light district  But it was really  Just like you know  A flop house  To save money  And you know  Patrice and Keith  Flipped out  And I was just  Wanted to be  A people pleaser  So they had me  Back to Amsterdam  And I'm like  It's not so bad  And yeah  It had like  It was a square room  Four metal bunk beds  And it had a  Five by five window  It's a hostel  Yeah  And they complained  And I didn't 
[03:51:00]  I told the guy  I'm fine  This is great  I'm cool here  And the guy  Was lying to him  Like yeah  It's 30 minutes away  And blah blah blah  Trying to get him  Not to go  They were like  Fuck you  Pick us up  We're out of here  They left  It wound up  Only being  10 minutes away  It was the  Nicest hotel ever  That they put  Patrice and Keith  On  And I had to  Spend the night  By myself  In this  Fucking hostel  I was fucking  Shit in my pants  And then  The next day  I come out  To get in the van  As they're picking me up 
[03:51:30]  To go to the show  I had bought  A black shirt  And black  Polyester pants  But I didn't know  That I bought  Bell bottoms  Oh no  I came out  I came out  Of the hostel  And it looked like  I had a fucking  Black evening gown on  The pounding  That went on  In that van  I'm not even  Kidding you  It was so brutal  And so rapid fire  Between Keith  And you know  Keith's laugh  And Patrice's laugh 
[03:52:00]  Not only did Patrice  Hit you with  A fucking crazy  Fucked up  Just right on  The money slam  His laugh  Just mushed  It into your face  Oh and  And drowned out  Anything you had  Coming back with  There's nothing  You could  His laugh  Was like the extra  Just foot on the face  In the mud  And I remember  The guy  Franz  Who didn't laugh  At us all week  Thought we were assholes  Had to pull the  Fucking van over  He was laughing  So hard 
[03:52:30]  This is a French guy  Too  I don't think he understood  English that well  Then  I  I'm going to be honest  With you  I had a tear  In my eye  Like I welled up  Honestly  Honest to god  Sometimes  I got pounded  By these guys  Cause it's hard  To fucking take  Somebody  Cause they're being  So honest  With you  I look like  I got raped  And I was  Somebody's bitch  In prison  I mean  And I fucked up  And I was so scared  To walk out of that hotel  With my fucking  Bell bottoms on 
[03:53:00]  Your evening gown  And then the fact  That they didn't even  Give me a second  You know  Some comics  You'd be like  Hey what's up man  Nice pants  And they'd just  Talk about you  Behind your back  None of our crew  Would do that  It was sometimes  That hurt so bad  That you  I mean dude  I literally had  Tears in my eyes  They told me  Bob  They told me  That they actually  Invited you over  To their great hotel  That they stayed at  And then you came  Walking in  And acted like  You were going to  Stay there  And they didn't let you  They made you go back  To your flop house  And he said  After the thing 
[03:53:30]  Patrice looked back  And saw me  My feelings were hurt  He saw that  I was legitimately  My feelings were hurt  And he goes  Bobby you can come  With us tonight  And I go  I go  Can I  He goes  Absolutely not  Stupid  I was listening  Before with the  The weight stuff  And I really  It just  It really bugs me  To no end  That Joe DeRosa  Is fucking  Saying that  I need more  Help than him  He looks like  His body  Is any character
