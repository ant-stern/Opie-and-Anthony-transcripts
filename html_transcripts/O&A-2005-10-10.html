<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a barrage of highly offensive and vulgar insults exchanged between Opie, Anthony, and their staff.  They then showcase graphic videos, including a failed parachute jump and a grape-stomping accident, punctuated by more offensive commentary and laughter.  Patrice O'Neal, filling in for Jim Norton (who’s on Jay Leno), joins the show.  The conversation turns to police brutality, sparked by a video of New Orleans police officers beating a Black man.  Opie, Anthony, and O'Neal share their experiences with law enforcement, using racist and offensive language.  Their opinions diverge: O'Neal attributes brutality to resisting arrest, while Opie and Anthony emphasize racial bias.

The show continues with discussions on Anthony's reckless driving, George W. Bush's Katrina response, and racial disparities in police interactions.  Brief interviews include Jeff from Chicago praising O'Neal's HBO special and Peter Iwers from In Flames delivering an awkward anti-bullying message.  The segment also covers Boston sports, particularly the Red Sox's struggles and the Patriots' success,  including speculation on player trades and the "curse" of the Red Sox.  The Astros' lengthy playoff game against the Angels is also mentioned.

One host recounts attending a U2 concert at Madison Square Garden, detailing celebrity sightings like Dennis Leary, Liam Neeson, and Chelsea Clinton (whose alleged canoodling with a new boyfriend is discussed at length, along with speculation about the value of a picture).  The Bush daughters' absence from the public eye is also mentioned.  The discussion extends to the enduring relevance of bands like U2 and the Rolling Stones, contrasting them with less successful groups,  including a lengthy segment on one host's brother's U2 tribute band, "2U," and their upcoming performance at the Opie and Anthony Halloween party.  A significant portion is devoted to a caller, Paul, who details his "media assault" on a Fox News segment, including audio clips and a detailed account of a physical altercation.  The hosts delve into a potential ménage à trois involving Paul, his wife Denise, and Big A, with a phone call featuring Denise, Paul, and Big A revealing explicit details and humorous anecdotes. This includes explicit details about Denise's sexual encounter with a soap opera star.

The next segment opens with discussion of Mayor Bloomberg's response to a subway bomb threat, followed by discussion of their "Assault on the Media" contest, featuring Paul and Social Studies Steve's submissions.  The Columbus Day parade’s traffic impact is briefly discussed.  Paul calls in to promote his website, NoFilterPaul.com.  A sports segment covers NFL games (Patriots and Jets) and a Tiger Woods/John Daly golf match.  A news story about Mexican prostitutes using drugged eye drops to rob and kill clients sparks a discussion about prostitution and Opie's positive experience with a sex product. The discussion shifts to a New Jersey man arrested for sodomizing his dog, leading to a debate about bestiality and the sharing of anecdotal stories, including a video of a man having sex with a chicken.  The segment concludes with further discussion of the subway bomb threat and the competitive nature of local news weather reporting, specifically the "Doppler 2 million" radar system.

The show continues with a discussion on creatively named Doppler radar systems, encouraging listeners to submit audio clips of local weather reports.  One host recounts his frustrating search for apple cake.  More discussion follows on the names of weather radar systems, including sexually suggestive remarks.  Listener calls provide more examples of radar names.  The conversation turns to the vastness of the Earth and humanity's insignificance, leading to a discussion about the Earth as a living organism, potential extinction events, and the lasting evidence of humanity.  Conspiracy theories, government cover-ups, and the lack of widespread biodiesel adoption are discussed, followed by listener calls.  One host recounts observing people having sex on a cruise ship balcony using night vision goggles.  The segment concludes with a listener-submitted "dump contest" and announcements about the return of a regular co-host and upcoming appearances by other personalities.

The final segment features Francine's inept news delivery, punctuated by sexually explicit and offensive jokes from Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal. Francine’s misinterpretations, invented words, and misuse of vocabulary are highlighted, along with offensive racial slurs and stereotypes.  Patrice shares explicit details of his sexual technique.  Francine's aspirations to attend law school and alleged habit of receiving money for wearing short skirts are discussed.  Listener calls comment on the segment, further emphasizing the offensive and comedic nature of the broadcast.

[00:05:00]  I love that one.  A little taser action.  I like this one.  That's some pain.  That's some guy that parachute, his parachute failed. 
[00:05:30]  He was jumping off a cliff with a parachute.  His parachute didn't open.  And he just hit the rocks.  And he got a camera on his helmet.  And that's him just crawling around the rocks going,  Make it stop.  That's got to hurt.  Make it stop.  And then there's, oh, oh, oh.  That woman.  Do you have that one?  She was stomping the grapes and she fell out of the thing.  That was my favorite. 
[00:06:00]  Is that it?  No, that's not.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The music's still playing.  Oh, I can't reach.  And right before that, she was trying to be all, like, witty.  Oh, you've seen the video, right?  I've seen the video.  It was the fun news piece that they go to.  Let's go now.  They'll be squishing grapes.  She slipped out of that thing and fell right on a noggin.  And that's her losing her wind.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I can't reach.  Stop.

Oh.  Oh.  That must have.  Oh.  Well, we wish her all the best.  Oh, I hope she's okay.  Oh, oh.  Oh.  They can't even step out of their newspaper. 
[00:07:00]  Out of their phoniness.  I just go, holy shit, did you see her fall on her ass?  Why are regular people not that frustrated with, like, you know, we sit there and we watch it.  Yeah.  And regular people at home are not as frustrated with the phoniness that they see every day.  Yep.  Watch out.  She's not like something bad happened to her.  Oh, well, gosh, I hope she's okay.  Oh, ow, ow, ow, stop, ow, ow, I can't breathe, ow. 
[00:07:30]  They don't know how to react.  It's amazing.  They're like, we have to be news reporters the whole time so we can't react to this shit.  That's right.  Pretty amazing.  Good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We got Opie, we got Ant, and we got Patrice, who's filling in for somebody.  We don't even know anymore.  At this point, we don't know.  Who's being filled in for?  Is it Little Jimmy Norton?  Is it Bill Burr?  Little Jimmy Norton is coming back tomorrow.  Yeah.  He would have been here today, but he's doing Jay Leno tonight.  Oh, well.  He looks like his 25th time. 
[00:08:00]  He's like a regular on there.  Yep.  They like the edgy little ball guy.  He's the guy.  He knows how to just keep it within the boundaries of television, but push it so far that Jay  has to look at him every so often.  What are you talking about there?  Oh, don't be saying this.  On the edge of edgy.  On the edge of edgy.  Last time, he was sitting on the couch next to, what's the phrase there?  Hillary Duff.  Hillary Duff.  And he made a pedophile joke.  And, you know, Jay...  Pedophile.  Jay don't care.  I know.  It's amazing that he doesn't care. 
[00:08:30]  He sits there.  Then you watch Letterman, and he's telling old jokes.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Oh.  That used to be like one of those...  There's a bunch of dreams that comics have.  Yeah.  And Letterman, I think late night talk show stand-up dream is gone.  I think...  Yeah.  Like where it's like you go, that's my dream.  A couple of corny white guys is like, yeah, that's my dream.  That used to be my dream, too.  Do Letterman.  Do Tonight Show.  Do HBO Special.  And do...  And then you're on your way.  Yeah.  That's what used to happen. 
[00:09:00]  Well, with Johnny, that's what used to happen.  Yeah, like, you know...  You were a comic, and you did well on Johnny, and you got to sit on the couch.  That was it.  I've been famous by now, I think.  Next day.  Oh, forget it.  In 1986.  Patrice O'Neal.  This would be a big thing, me being here in the morning.  I'd come in here.  Where's my blue M&M's?  Where's my...  Where's my...  You'd have that kid-and-play haircut, though, and shit, you know?  I want my pork-less bacon.  Well, you ordered some breakfast food, and Ben was panicking, calling you every 20 minutes,  going, Patrice, where are you? 
[00:09:30]  He's like, he'll be here.  You're supposed to be here early to show prep with the boys.  Yeah, Negroes prepping?  Yeah, right?  Just show up.  I'm showing up.  Just show up, and we're happy.  Yeah, Ben's calling you like, well, you know those people.  You got to get them out of bed.  You practically got to go there and dress them.  He is a master of, like, you know, growing up in Boston, man, I'm just...  Yeah.  What's they called?  Racist?  Passive aggression?  Racism?  And passive aggression?  What's that called? 
[00:10:00]  Oh, boy, oh, boy, man.  Hey, do you think you're going to make it?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, the cops are shoving something on my booty right now.  Hey, that's...  Hey, you're going to be...  So you're still...  Plans haven't changed, though, right?  You're still here?  Yeah, Ben, don't worry about it.  Passive aggression is the worst.  I'd rather them go, you fat mother...  Get here!  You'll want to punch him in his face.  Oh, there's the video of the morning, man.  Oh, the horse.  Now, this New Orleans clip is the greatest thing ever to come out of New Orleans in, well, 
[00:10:30]  a couple of weeks anyway.  I guess they're back to business as usual.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, New Orleans, welcome back to the country.  You're back.  You made it.  You got through this event, and we're back to showing clips of cops just beating the  shit out of some black guy on Bourbon Street or whatever down there.  I love how the horse backed up, so...  Oh, the horse's job in that whole thing was to block the camera view.  Make sure sometime today you get to see this video. 
[00:11:00]  It's pretty amazing.  This guy was, I guess, 62, 64 years old?  I'm going to say 64, yeah.  64, something like that.  Oh, and he beat this guy up because he took the video?  And, yeah.  Yeah, and he wasn't submitting to the cuffing.  Now, at that point, I don't understand it.  Patrice, maybe you can help me out with this one.  Go ahead, man.  Why do the black guys, I know the drunk white guys do it out of the trailer homes and shit,  but it's usually the black guys you see on cops.  Why don't they just put their hands behind their back and get cuffed? 
[00:11:30]  Because you feel like, look, man, you...  Oh, God.  Look at the horse.  Hey, you got nothing to see here.  Nothing to see here.  It's just a big horse.  The cop just behind the horse.  The cop is just tuning him up, and also the horse backs up.  Backs up.  You don't see shit.  You can hear white, like, exclusion of this incident as stress.  Watch this.  Oh, they've been under a lot of pressure.  A lot of these people lost their homes.  They're stressed out and damp, so they get to beat everybody. 
[00:12:00]  But I see it happen.  I see what, like, after a car chase or something, the black guy goes running, the cops grab him,  and the guy doesn't want to put his hand, and they beat the shit out of him.  They're pulling on his arm.  They're clubbing him.  Why not just go, you got me.  Here's my arms.  They're behind my back.  Well, spoken like a true, never-been-under-arrest guy in his life.  God bless you, Mr. Learning about cops on television.  Because they're hurting you. 
[00:12:30]  Can I tell you about my experience?  If I'm walking you into the movie theater, but I'm pinching your face, won't you resist?  Come on, sweetie, as I'm jabbing you with a sharp pencil.  Cops are horrible like that.  But why are they hurting you to start with?  Because they ran after you.  Like, I can understand if I chase you and I got you.  It's just like, I guess it's like, going to have sex with a girl, and you've been trying  to have sex with her a long time, and finally. 
[00:13:00]  And then the sex is not going to be like lovemaking.  It's going to be like, it took you this long.  It's going to be a fucking whack.  And that's what the cops, they chased you, and now they're going to fuck you.  They're pissed off a little bit.  They need to take it out on you just a little bit.  I understand that.  You know what I'm saying?  I was arrested one time, and it was because I had a suspended license, and I got pulled  over, and the guy took me in.  But- 
[00:13:30]  Where was this?  This was many, many years ago.  I believe 1983.  If I could be a little date here.  Well, that's when they just found out Italians were like, had a little black in them.  Yeah, a little bit.  He should have done something.  They weren't sure.  The government wasn't sure if you were black or white.  At that time, they were a little bit closed-minded.  Well, I got to tell you my experience with the police.  When I got pulled over, I gave my license.  He comes back and goes, you know, there's a warrant for your arrest because you had a 
[00:14:00]  ticket.  You didn't pay it.  Your license is suspended.  I'm going to have to bring you down.  So I went, okay.  I locked up my car.  I sat in the front seat, unhandcuffed with the officer for the drive down to the precinct.  He sat me at the desk.  I filled out some paperwork, and they let me go.  That was my only arrest ever.  Patrice has given you the look of death.  I sat in the front.  People that passed by in the car thought the cop was, it was take your son to work day. 
[00:14:30]  That's how pleasant it was.  I had both hands free to, I could have grabbed a shotgun if I wanted.  People don't even have videotapes when white guys get arrested.  I was like, ah, nothing's going to happen.  Did he get to play with the siren on the way to the?  I was like, could you just, you know.  I think he did make a joke.  He pulled out his club, because they don't drive with it.  He pulled it out and put it in a little holder.  He goes, hey, if you get out of hand, beat yourself with this.  As you were waiting. 
[00:15:00]  He actually said that.  As you were waiting for mommy to pick you up at the precinct.  Mommy, I'm arrested.  Did you get to wear his hat?  I wore the hat and I licked an ice cream cone as I waited for Sal to come to bail me out.  I think my bail was $20.  That's nice.  And Sal had to come down and pay $20 because I didn't even have that on him.  Can you relate to that?  Not even a job.  My mother used to beat me going to school.  My mother would abuse me. 
[00:15:30]  Anytime I was in the back of any car, it was abuse.  There was some kind of abuse happening.  Someone poking me with something.  But that's the only relationship I have with that.  That's the only way I can relate to being arrested.  Never this.  The taser.  You ever been tased?  No, man.  I probably would die, man.  My heart ain't.  Yeah, you wouldn't be able to take it?  I probably would die, man.  I don't resist cops either.  I try to get that verbal thing down where I can get under skin. 
[00:16:00]  People's skin.  Oh, you do that, though?  Yeah, I really try to be.  And one thing I never did was yell out the law.  I learned that because growing up, I saw the dude who was like,  In the bylaws of, you know, this black dude, you can scream at cops the law.  Let me tell you something.  Chapter 12.  Paragraph 8.  I have the right to look you in your eyes.  It's just like, ah, you're going to get your face blown off.  So I learned early not to yell the law to police.  Yeah, they know it well enough.  Let me tell you something. 
[00:16:30]  Chapter 648, under the constitutional amendment of law, says this, sucker.  Yeah, bam, right in the fucking kneecap with the club.  I have the right to stand in my own space.  But you don't know that there's a law that gets, the cops have a thing that gets around any law that you think you know.  Yeah.  It's called disorderly conduct.  And all you have to do is disobey a cop's order to move.  Right.  And that, it cancels out all, like, I have the right to look around. 
[00:17:00]  Nope.  No, you don't.  Disorderly conduct.  Sir, move.  Ah, let me tell you something, sucker.  Over.  Well, and later on, the charge will be dropped, and you'll get out.  But for that moment, you are getting arrested, and you're going to jail.  You have to obey police for some goofy reason.  That's the job.  You can't question, but you can ask questions.  But it's like when they tell you to move, if there's something going on, that's disorderly conduct.  Then you've got to look.  Right there.  I just don't understand the whole car thing. 
[00:17:30]  I don't, like, I just, I guess in my whole life, I've never driven with a black person at the wheel.  I never have, Patrice.  Why?  I think we should go out and drive so I can get a little more experience.  I just never have.  Patrice, I drove with Patrice once.  How was that?  It was nice.  Did you get pulled over?  No, he's got a big old car.  Yeah?  He's got to move the seat all the way back.  He's pretty much sitting in the back seat as he drives his own car.  I'm not even kidding.  It's amazing.  You can see, I hope he was a little uncomfortable, and he's trying to get a little more comfortable after a while. 
[00:18:00]  You can see he was absorbing the whole, soaking it in.  I was in the passenger seat in the front, but I had to turn all the way to the back to talk to Patrice.  I was like, that's the strangest thing.  If I ever get pulled over, and I do a lot.  I get pulled over a lot.  In New York?  Yeah.  I speed.  I pay no attention to rules, to signs, to things.  I go point A, point B.  I'm getting there.  I don't care what I got to do.  I find that New York City cops don't pull you over often, man. 
[00:18:30]  They don't a lot, but some of the shit I do is really stupid.  Like, I'll drive on a fucking sidewalk.  I've done it.  In the city?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was going through Queens just the other day.  I got over the bridge, and I'm trying to get onto the road that goes to the entrance ramp to the expressway.  And the tractor trailer decided he's going to try to turn from under the expressway overpass in Queens,  and couldn't make the turn.  Now he can't back up, because there's cars that were right on the truck's ass. 
[00:19:00]  Right.  The truck is stuck, blocking every lane of traffic.  The car's trying to get to the expressway.  What'd you do?  I looked, I saw there was one parking space open that revealed the curb and the sidewalk to me.  So I popped the curb.  I've been in the car with Anthony.  I've seen him take the curb many times.  And I drove on the sidewalk for about, I don't know, two, no, about a block, 
[00:19:30]  until I could get around the truck back onto the road.  But then I had to find another open parking space to get back onto the street,  and that took me a little further than the truck.  So I'm just driving down the sidewalk.  Then I popped back on, and that's it.  You know, somebody knows about Anthony, like, over these few years I've known you guys.  Yeah.  When you see pictures of you guys, Anthony looks like a disturbed guy, like, you know,  like one of these sociopaths, right?  But you know what?  He's really an outraged white guy.  Like, I never realized it was one day I came, and he was complaining about computers, 
[00:20:00]  and no one was customer servicing him.  Yeah.  You know, and to this story, you're just like an outrage.  You're right.  Like, I shouldn't have to, I shouldn't have to, I shouldn't have to, officer, I'm driving.  How dare you, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.  Anthony really is outraged.  You are right.  I am an outraged white guy, and I don't even look the part, you're right.  An entitled guy, I didn't realize. 
[00:20:30]  Like, you look like, Anthony, let's go, man.  Let's get out.  Let's rob this bank real quick.  Come on.  Why, why would you?  I have my assessor in this very establishment, Patrice.  Why would I want to disturb?  Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.  That really wasn't an entitled story.  Now, he drove up on a sidewalk.  Oh, yeah.  Because he qualified it with the track, the trailer, blocking up progress.  Why, why, why, why, why?  I have things to do, people to see.  I pay you taxes to widen the highway. 
[00:21:00]  This should be more highway and not sidewalk.  Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why.  You are so fucking right.  Oh, my God, he is right.  Anthony looks nuts.  He looks nuts.  Yeah, I look like a lunatic.  You do tell like you're entitled to drive on the sidewalk.  I got, I got, I got a ticket in, uh, in Philly, when we were in Philly.  I'm driving.  I don't know the area or, or shit.  And, uh, I try to go around a bunch of traffic.  It was a shitload of traffic.  And I noticed one of these lanes are open. 
[00:21:30]  And I'm like, why is this lane open?  So I get in it, and then I realize why it's open.  Because it's a turn-only lane.  But I, I don't want to turn.  I want to go straight.  You can't go straight.  It's one way.  But I notice this halfway through the intersection.  Now I can't turn, I can't go straight, because, uh, it's, it's one way.  So I turn into the corner of the intersection and go between two, uh, telephone pole and  a sign over a curb into a 7-Eleven parking lot and park like I'm getting a fucking Slurpee. 
[00:22:00]  Because there's a cop right in the parking lot.  And I'm like, now I got to park.  I can't just keep going.  Now I got to park.  And I get out like I'm going into 7-Eleven.  And the cop goes, excuse me, hello.  And I pointed 7-Eleven.  Like, yeah, I'm just getting something.  I realized at the last minute.  You just insulted that cop.  You can't do that right now.  Oh, I know.  He has no choice at that, at that moment.  And he wrote me up for, uh, uninspected.  Because that's what I had.  Oh, because you're white. 
[00:22:30]  Didn't give me the rest of the tickets.  I'm learning how to like cops, though.  I'm not as angry at cops as I used to be.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to be, now here's what, the whole thing I was getting to is, here's what you  got to do, though, when you get pulled over, is be nice.  If it's nighttime, boom, the dome light goes right on.  I open up the glove, get out all my shit right away.  And then I sit there with my, the window down, both hands on the steering wheel, dome light  on, dome light on, and he walks up, and it puts him at ease.  And then it's, yes, sir, here, sir, everything, sir. 
[00:23:00]  Sir, sir, sir, sir.  They come back, no problems, nothing.  But that's, that's white guy technique.  Black guy technique, I think the best way to be is a complete ass, like, like sarcastic,  as if to go, I ain't do nothing wrong without saying, I ain't do nothing wrong, sucker.  It's more like, ah, you roll the window down, just a crack.  Eh?  What?  Just a crack.  What's going on, big man?  Call him chief.  Just, call him chief. 
[00:23:30]  Just to say, if you arrest me, I'm not going to resist, but if you arrest me, it's because  this is going to be racist, because I'm not doing anything wrong.  All my stuff is, is good.  And, like, you know, the thing about it, though, I'm living in Jersey City or being, doing  comedy, gets you to meet a lot of guys.  I got, I got a lot of PBA cards, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I got, like, not even PBA, I got, like, the, you got the shit, the, the, the, the officers  of the world one, you know what I mean?  So I stop that whole police, ah, I pull it out, I'm very, I'm entitled now, too. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  Well, I got one of these.  I have the two-fingered look-away, Gib.  Take that, will you?  Take a look at that, I'm important.  If that helps me out a little bit.  That's great.  I always sarcastic the cops a little bit when I think of something, you know.  All right.  I've always just had the fear of God in me when police are involved and never, ever gave  them a hard time.  I got pulled over once on the LIE with a case of beer on the passenger seat with four of 
[00:24:30]  them missing.  Now, he knows who was drinking the beers.  It's not like I bought a case with four, you know.  Can I take a case less four?  Maybe just give them to the toll takers.  Like, he knows I drank four beers and I'm driving this fucking car.  And you called him Hufficer.  Hufficer.  And he made me blow the breathalyzer.  And he looked and it had shown I had been drinking, but I hadn't enough in me to arrest 
[00:25:00]  me.  But he said, you know, I can have you sit here longer to see if you would just finish those  and have you blow this again in like 20 minutes.  He goes, but I'll let you go.  Just be careful driving.  And meanwhile, I'm, you know, I'm going to continue drinking.  I was going to ask you, did you crack the next one over?  It's number five.  Number five.  I was on my way to the boat.  So, you know, I'm going to be drinking anyway. 
[00:25:30]  And driving the boat.  Hey, back it up a little bit.  We found the reporter that fell doing the grape thing.  Oh, yeah.  Because you got to hear the happy reporters.  Yeah, the end of the newscast with the, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Here's the full story.  And one of the things that's done is right here, these buckets are filled with grapes.  What kind of grapes?  These are filled with Chamberson grapes.  And the winner this Saturday, who stomps the most juice, will actually win an overnight stay here at Chateau La La.  You ready?  Horrible story.  Yeah, let's go.  That's disgusting.  All right.  You ready? 
[00:26:00]  Give us a 30 second time.  Here we go.  So what's the deal here?  This is the best part there.  Continue to the interview is they stomp as hard as they can.  Now, and she's just a little fat woman.  A little fat woman.  Just a round little fat woman.  Yeah, a little fat woman.  And they're having a competition, what they're doing.  But has no business doing any exercise whatsoever.  Trying to be asked for it.  No.  They're doing a competition where they're seeing who could stomp the most juice out of the grapes.  Right.  In a set amount of time.  Sure.  And when she fucks up, it's when they call time and she decides she's going to do this 
[00:26:30]  quick little step to get in the last few.  And cheat is pretty much what she's doing.  And it backfires and she slips.  I just love to hear the stomping as she continues the interview here.  The deal here.  There's a contest to stomp.  And how are you measuring who does the best stomping?  And whoever stomps the most juice wins an overnight stay.  But it's not the only thing you can do.  The measuring cups are down below, right?  The measuring cups are down below.  All right.  And if you win, you get to stay at Chateau Lawn.  And what else do you have going on here?  Well, a grape-comping partner thing. 
[00:27:00]  You can come and spend the day listening to live music, eating international foods, having  wine tours and tastings, vineyard tours, seminars, arts and crafts.  It's a lot of fun.  A whole day.  Stop.  Oh, stop.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ow, ow, ow.  And they're on top of like a, what looks like a dry dock.  It's a dock, but it's on land.  It's like a big platform, yeah.  And it's off the ground, how high would you say? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, they were up the ground, at least three, three and a half feet, maybe four feet.  Yeah, and she's in the barrel stomping it.  And she tries to stomp real quick, slips, and her shins hit the edge of the barrel, and  she topples right out of it.  Knocks the wind out of her.  It gets the wind knocked out of her.  It makes these sounds.  Stop.  Oh, stop.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  What?  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, stop, oh, stop, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[00:28:00]  I can't breathe.  Stop.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  No.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  Oh, oh dear, yeah, I think she's actually hurt there.  And one of the, and there was a black woman, right?  Was she?  One of the reporters.  I don't know.  One of the people going, it was, it's hard.  She's like, oh, yes, yes, yes.  Oh.  Oh, child. 
[00:28:30]  It's like, they can't show any human emotions still.  No.  Listen again.  Stop, stop, stop, stop.  Oh, no, oh dear.  Boy, I think she's actually hurt there.  No, I think she is.  Yeah, she's hurt.  She took a hard fall off there.  Okay.  Gosh, I hope she's okay.  Okay.  We're going to make sure she is.  We'll try and check on her and get back here as soon as we can.  We'll be back right after this.  Yeah.  And she adds one last, gee.  That was a Sherry O'Terry thing.  Ouch.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, boy. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, I saw that.  That was the funniest thing.  That might have been the funniest thing I ever saw.  I had to watch that when I first saw it, I swear, 25 times.  It was hilarious.  I just had to keep playing it over and over again.  I thought that, you ever see the cop shoot himself in the foot?  No.  Oh, at the class?  The DEA agent?  Yeah.  Shoot himself in the foot.  You never seen that one?  I don't think I did.  Where he was teaching?  He was a big DEA dude, and he was just like, kids, don't play with guns.  Guns are a terrible thing, and I know about guns.  Yeah, I know.  You don't know about them.  Takes his gun out. 
[00:29:30]  Boom.  Goes off.  Shoots himself.  I think it went in his leg.  Nah, his foot.  Shot at his foot.  Did he shoot himself in his foot?  Shot at his foot.  And he's like, okay, be calm.  He's trying to calm the children after that.  It's the funny.  I've seen it 50 times.  It's the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Shoots himself in the foot.  Hey, the New Orleans cops beating up that guy?  Yeah.  Well, they had an expert on the early show to discuss the video.  Always got an expert.  This is always good.  This is the video everyone's checking out today.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's very, very, very good. 
[00:30:00]  It is the latest black eye for a police department heavily criticized after Hurricane Katrina.  Joseph McNamara is a criminal justice expert at the Hoover Institution.  Good morning, sir.  Good morning.  You are the chief of police in Kansas City, San Jose, California.  This is part of your life's work.  You see tape like this.  What's your reaction?  Well, the tapes look terrible for the police.  They're certainly not trained to handcuff people by punching them around the way we saw on the tape. 
[00:30:30]  Having said that, the police are also trained that even the most routine arrest is dangerous.  When I was police chief, I had two big, powerful police officers killed under similar circumstances trying to handcuff someone when the prisoner got their weapon and shot them to death with their own gun.  Understood.  At the same time, this is Bourbon Street.  This is New Orleans in its very initial steps of trying to get back on its feet again.  Bourbon Street is a place where public intoxication is welcomed, not discouraged. 
[00:31:00]  It just seems, these things just seem terribly out of context.  Well, it looks like it got out of hand, but of course, we don't know what happened before the tapes are shown.  And I think it's been pretty one-sided coverage so far.  It's a terrible tape.  But nevertheless, we have to hear why the police confronted this man to begin with.  Was he actually armed?  Did they know he was armed?  Did they think he was armed?  Was he trying to get their weapon? 
[00:31:30]  And so they have the right to the presumption of innocence, just as he does.  But it is a terrible blow.  The city of New Orleans, I think the whole country is rooting for New Orleans, and they don't need this kind of publicity.  Yeah, I guess that doesn't help, huh?  No.  That was Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, I was just one-sided coverage.  I didn't mind that guy, though.  He was all right.  I didn't mind.  He was trying to do both sides.  He was trying to cover his pals. 
[00:32:00]  He was all right.  You know what I mean?  He's a cop, though.  Yeah.  Because I know there's got to be a dangerous job.  I know I would shoot people if I was a cop, and I would do bad things with people if I was a cop.  You watch all...  I watch all the cop shows, and, you know, sometimes, yeah, some guys are struggling like that, pulls the gun out, boom, dead.  There's the wife and kid at the funeral.  So, I don't know.  And, you know, it's Bourbon Street.  I could give a shit what they do to people on Bourbon Street.  I've been there.  We've seen it.  Who cares?  But it's back to Bourbon?  Is it back to...  It's back.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:30]  Welcome back to the country after your disaster.  Yeah.  They're back getting drunk.  They've got the strip clubs back up and run.  Beat up.  The tits are back.  It's fantastic.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They're back.  Well, they're not.  They're on their way.  Everything you need is there.  They're on their way.  Hey, the president's making his, what, eighth trip?  Eighth trip.  Did he do his eighth trip yet?  No, making it today.  Eighth trip down.  He's making his eighth trip down.  Make sure everything's okay.  Make sure people can be free and live in freedom.  I hate it. 
[00:33:00]  He's the worst.  And he's staying overnight.  He's showing that, you know, Norris is back and we're going to...  He's sleeping in that plane.  Yeah.  They're going to land that plane.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  They're going to land that plane in the fifth ward.  He kills me, man.  But you know what?  Eight trips.  The thing about Bush, man, I don't hate him as much as I used to because after Katrina,  I kind of felt a little bit at the tsunami, but after Katrina, you realize he just doesn't  know.  Like, he does not know.  And the reason you realize that is because after Rita came, how happy he was that Rita 
[00:33:30]  came so he could get a chance to pretend he knew something.  Redeem himself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, and he kept, the eye, he kept just saying the eye, and the eye, be careful.  The eye.  There's a lot of wind.  And he was making twirling things with his finger.  There's a lot of this.  We'll make sure if Houston gets evacuated.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, evacuated.  He just don't...  But what is he doing?  This is the eighth trip down there. 
[00:34:00]  What are you doing?  Eighth trip.  I think he just looks around and goes...  Is it any better?  Is that area any better off?  Because he made eight trips, then it would have been if he didn't go there.  It's like when you have a project at home, you really don't know what you're doing, so  you keep going, let's say, to the garage, you want to rearrange the garage, and you go  out there and you look around like...  I think it's more like you're hungry, and you keep going to the cabinet, even though  you know there's nothing in there to eat.  Right, and you're just like hoping that...  You keep opening it, you're hoping something's going to pop out at you. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, something you missed.  Something you missed.  Open the fridge again.  Oh, I see a can of beets.  Oh, there's nothing in here.  I'm hungry.  But that's what he's doing.  Once a week, he goes down there just to go, dah.  But somebody's telling him, you know, it's like, would it be, like, as a country, would  we be, like, would we feel afraid if he said, look, I don't really know what to do in this  situation.  I got people telling me, but...  I guess you can't be that blunt with the American people.  We'd panic.  I have no clue what's going on here. 
[00:35:00]  Because there are people, there are plenty of people, as you know, are out there that  think he is a great, competent, intelligent leader of this nation.  And if you criticize that, they will call you the worst things ever, liberal, communist,  whatever the hell they want to call you.  When his record shows that maybe he isn't just the sharpest president we've had.  He just looks, he just doesn't, like, people who, like, you know, we read human nature  as performers.  You just read something. 
[00:35:30]  You know how to pick it up quick.  And you just go, whoa, whoa, whoa, this dude is, you know, you don't want to call the  president stupid, but this dude is, he doesn't know, man.  He's not going to make a four-scoring 20 years ago speech, you know what I'm saying?  He's just, he's just like a Texas, like, cracker or something.  He's just a silly dude, man.  He doesn't know.  I voted for him.  Yeah.  Did you know he was a silly dude?  He had me bamboozled.  Both times?  Both times he had me bamboozled.  So, wait, what brought you out of bamboozling?  No, the second time didn't bamboozle. 
[00:36:00]  It was more that Kerry was just nothing.  For how bad Bush is, Kerry was just uber retard.  And Bush isn't looking that great these days, but people aren't pulling out the old, well,  you could have had Kerry.  No one's really saying that because they knew what a disaster he was as well.  His wife was infinitely more important than he was.  You can't have a president whose wife is, like, more important than you.  What an albatross.  As the owner of ketchup, you know, as the owner of condiments. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  What an albatross around his neck she was with that stupid accent.  No one could figure out what it was.  She said she was an African-American.  She was born in South Africa somewhere or wherever.  Just any time she opened her mouth, his approval rating, his polls just plummeted.  As racist as everybody thought he was, he didn't get along with blacks too much,  but I would say the best, like, politician I've ever seen in terms of controlling something  had to be Giuliani.  Like, the dude just was inked.  You just felt like, all right, everything's... 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, we're going to be okay.  Well, you know, let's not forget a lot of the situation he was in.  Yeah, a lot of people did not like him before...  Oh, September 10th?  That motherfucker was one of the hated, most hated guys.  Racist crowd!  What about the squeegee guys?  You fucking...  The hot dog vendors, you stink.  That's why he's so great.  He turned all that around.  He really did.  One day.  Within a week or two weeks.  So we needed that stuff you hated, you needed it at that time.  You know what I'm saying?  We hated his control before that, but after that, it's like... 
[00:37:30]  That guy, those buildings came down.  The guy is running into the dust to a microphone going,  this is what we're doing.  We got this set up.  The command post is here.  Like a general in a war.  That guy was right there.  And Bush, a hurricane comes and he's...  Out of resources.  We got to move out the resources.  I'm in constant contact with FEMA.  I just got to figure out what that stands for. 
[00:38:00]  He had not a clue what was going on.  His gays are going by.  These poor motherfuckers are sitting there drinking dirty water, mud.  I had a broken FEMA.  I'm talking to all nine radius.  I'm talking to tibia and fibula.  Tibula, fibula.  We're going to be talking to all the bones.  I'm talking to cranium.  But for some reason, the FEMA is very important to this.  Oh, God damn. 
[00:38:30]  I'm talking to tibia and fibula.  Because the leg bone connected to the shin bone.  Oh, man.  What was the hurricane blamed on again?  The Muslims said it was...  God.  Well, you know, Allah.  Allah.  It was striking us down for our ways and stuff.  And that's what the Muslims were saying.  So what do they blame the earthquakes?  Exactly.  That's what I'm getting at.  They really bug me.  There's a few more dead over there than over here. 
[00:39:00]  And there was another one that killed like 70,000 in Iraq.  It's like, oh, really?  What are they just...  Those are the infidels?  Yeah, what is that?  They blame that on us, too, somehow.  Come on, man.  Somehow we did that.  All those places that the worst things happen is the most godly place.  You know, the most religious places.  This is the worst country in terms of religion you've ever seen.  We just don't...  It's too many of them around.  But the tsunami of the Buddhists, the Muslims... 
[00:39:30]  There's a lot of Muslims down there.  What?  You know, that Hurricane Katrina hits and killed...  I don't know what the count is, but let's say 1,000 people overall, the entire area.  And people are like, oh, my God, they should have evacuated this.  That hurricane hits anywhere else in the world.  20,000 people are dead.  20,000 people are dead.  This country somehow...  You get the earthquake in San Francisco, Los Angeles earthquake.  Same thing.  Anywhere else in the world, you get hit with an 8 anywhere in the world. 
[00:40:00]  Those places are crumbling.  They're in like sand huts.  Adobe and stuff.  It collapses on them.  Graves.  They don't even know how many people are dead.  Here, there's a couple of hundred people die with freak out.  I believe in God like everybody else, but it's like, you know, come on, man.  Start with the God versus God thing.  Well, if you want to take it that level, God must really love this country because we get horrible disasters and less people die than anywhere else in the world.  So God loves us. 
[00:40:30]  He goes, look, there's a few.  I couldn't help everybody.  I can't get everyone out.  I think that...  I think really New Orleans was God's way of saying, you know what, I'm not racist because  usually I kill a lot of white people in these days.  I'm a fair God.  You killed a lot of black people there that time.  I'm just going to kill a few blacks this time.  Hold it out.  Just this time.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Chicago.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jeff.  Love you guys.  Love your show.  Oh, thank you.  Just want to say, Patrice, man, got your HBO special Friday. 
[00:41:00]  You fucking killed, man.  It was awesome.  Well, thank you for that, sir.  It's the first nice thing anybody's ever said to me.  Thank you very much.  Oh, it was great.  Appreciate that, man.  Yeah, a lot of people calling up saying that you killed on HBO.  Oh, I appreciate that.  So there you go.  Thank you very much.  All right, Jeff.  All right, man.  I thought they were going to destroy my self-esteem early in the morning.  Nah.  No, we need you.  We'll knock you down around 10.45.  Around 10.45.  Hey, you're not funny.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to ride you for three hours, and then we're going to knock you down. 
[00:41:30]  I'm hearing birds.  Everything's beautiful.  Hey, everybody.  Everybody loves you.  I feel the love.  You guys.  That all?  You're not funny.  When you guys come in to fill in for Jim Norton, it's a whole different story.  You know that, right?  Like, Bob Kelly came in, and we ride him and abuse him really bad.  The first time he came in for Jim Norton, we're like, hey, Bob, you need coffee?  What do you need?  And he's looking around like, what the hell is going on here?  I'm really suspicious.  Like, what do you guys set me up for?  We're like, no, man.  We need you today.  Jimmy's not here. 
[00:42:00]  Sit down.  What do you need, buddy?  And we're doing the same thing to you.  You didn't have to wait out there in the waiting room.  Why would you ever do that?  Yeah.  Yeah, come on in.  How many egg sandwiches you want?  Seven?  They're yours.  Egg whites?  Come on in.  He'll be right up.  I'm not going to fall for the banana in the tailpipe.  Yeah, all you guys have this underlying feeling like it's the end of Carrie, and we put pig blood  over the door for you when you come walking in.  We set it up, though.  I mean, y'all helped, too, to set it up. 
[00:42:30]  Even back in the old station days, it's like, we all trash each other, so people hear that.  You know, they watched Tough Crowd back in the day.  It's like, no one's going to go, hey, man, you guys are great.  They're going to call.  I used to read.  I don't read message boards anymore.  I just do not do it.  You've got to have a very thick skin.  Oh, man.  If you're going to go on the message board.  After a while, you just get trashed so much, you just go, oh.  I thought it was a setup.  He goes, Patrice, I saw your HBO special.  I'm like, well, he's already called me or something.  No, they're saying you did great.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  They're saying you did great.  Let's take our first break.  We've got lots to do today.  Got to talk about the weekend.  I've got the story of the weekend in front of me here.  Oh, I see which one you're holding up here.  And I challenge the rest of America, you're not going to find a better story than what  we've got in our hands over here.  And I may take a controversial stand on this story, Opie.  Stay tuned.  What do we got here?  What are you pointing at?  Hawk.  Danny's what?  Danny did a remix of the reporter. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, Norton.  Nathaniel, could you sit back at Opie's left instead of having Hawk here?  Because look at how disappointed he gets.  Look at his little face.  We had some great rhythm going.  Didn't you feel like a nice rhythm?  It was so rolling.  I forgot that we were even doing a show.  I thought we were just hanging out again, just talking.  I teased what I wanted to.  Then I was going to say maybe we'll talk about the Yankees when we get back and the Astros  and the White Sox. 
[00:44:00]  Body language.  He did one of these.  He did one of these.  Calm down.  I want to talk about it.  He thumbed his nose.  He did a thumb nose.  Yeah.  We'll do a little sports when we get back.  It was rolling so smooth, and then just the big, you know what it's like?  Look at his poor face.  It's that big, grimy, sweaty hand on that big, rusted train brake handle.  Another white guy walked in the room. 
[00:44:30]  This is the white guy scratching his head to take the job.  Can I talk to you, thumb nose, Hawk, for a second, please?  We just called him in from the bullpen.  Yeah.  Did Than ever throw something out when we were going to break?  We're going to the left-hander.  We're going to the left-hander.  You've got to come out.  Ovi's got to take the mouse away from Hawk.  Hand it to Than.  Look at his face.  Come here, Toots.  Come here.  Sit down on my lap.  Come here.  Give me a kiss.  Poor guy.  You know how we talk about how we just smash each other? 
[00:45:00]  He's the only one that can't really take it yet.  Oh, he's hurt.  You can see him.  He's genuinely hurt.  He'll sit there and go, oh, I can take it, but he really can't take it.  He's a candidate for killing his wife when he gets married.  You can see that bag of head steam.  That quiet anger.  Look how pissed he is.  Look at him.  He really is salty.  Just take it in stride, baby girl.  I'm fine with it.  My job is just to throw material out for him.  See, now he's, first of all, don't shoot.  And let him pick what he wants.  My job.  Don't try to exclude himself from responsibility for that bombing. 
[00:45:30]  And he goes like this, because he did it.  His body language.  He pointed with this, like, hmm, this one.  And Opie's like, what the fuck?  What do you want?  He thought he found Radio Gold, like, I know you're going to want to do this.  And now he was just saying, he just goes, my job is to, and he points at the disc going,  is to just, so you're saying what you did was perfectly fine within your job,  and it didn't interrupt with the flow of the show, and you should have done that.  Yes. 
[00:46:00]  See, when he doesn't know, he hands these notes over.  Yeah.  I do see him.  Uh-huh.  It's when he points, as we're going to break, like, just in case.  But you saw him, and if it was something you would have wanted to bring up, you'd have brought it up.  And, you know, he finds a lot of good stuff for the show, you know.  You guys are not looking at his face.  This dude could kill everybody in this.  If he sneaks a gun past Master Poe, everybody's dead.  It's over.  Look at this quiet, this is deceiving.  He's the guy that just kills the people in the workplace. 
[00:46:30]  He's scratching.  Look at that.  I'm telling you.  Oh, my God.  He's pissed.  If it was comedy, if it was a comedy club, he'd take a sip of it.  That's, that's, he's trying to stop.  He's waiting for it to end.  Oh, yeah.  He's itching right now.  Oh, my God.  He's just, oh, my God.  He's scrapped to the thing.  Oh, he's a little pinker.  He's a little pinker in the face than he was earlier.  And he's looking at me like, you're a visitor, fat boy.  How about a smack house over your head?  We've got to break him in still.  It's been a year. 
[00:47:00]  He's getting better, but we've got to break him in a little more.  Oh, man.  It's all good.  All right, we've got lots to do, obviously.  We have another assault on the media we've got to get to.  That was amazing.  Oh, my God.  Believe it or not, No Filter Paul is in the lead for the assault on the media contest for  October.  He's a madman.  We'll get into that.  We'll get into some sports.  I went and saw you, too.  Want to talk about your brother's U2 tribute band?  Mm-hmm.  There's just a lot to do today, so stay there.  Oh.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the ONA virus. 
[00:47:30]  All right, we're going to lose Bill Burr soon, so let's get back into this.  We've got one more here from Peter from In Flames.  Hey, what's up?  It's Bill Burr.  Open in for the show.  You know that because you're listening to this shit.  I'm with the bass player from In Flames, Peter Iwers.  Hey, how was your set today, man?  It's going to be fine.  We haven't played yet.  We haven't played yet?  All right, we need to start that again, so I don't look like I know.  You're there, you go.  No, fuck it.  Just keep going, man.  I'm like a retarded... 
[00:48:00]  I got no reference here.  So how do you think your set's going to go tonight?  Are you looking forward?  Are you on the main stage?  Yeah.  Are you over there?  I think it's going to go great.  I mean, we always put in 150% and, you know, it's a bit different playing from a sitting  down crowd, but still it's going to be great.  So far, all the shows have been amazing, so I'm pretty sure today will be as well.  Do you guys like your vibe?  You're more mellow, melodic?  Is that like how you guys are?  I think we're metal.  It's hard to categorize us if you want bass, basically. 
[00:48:30]  Okay, all right.  So you're not like Iron Maid meets, you know, like pitch movies and stuff.  Do you like Iron Maid meets...  I guess we could say that, but it would be unfair probably to just categorize it into  one, you know, I don't like that.  We're metal bad.  All right, that's cool, man.  That's cool.  How long have you guys been playing?  A long time now, since...  I think it's like 12 years or something, the band.  Like 12 years?  Out of everybody in the band, if you had to kill someone, who would you kill?  Myself. 
[00:49:00]  You'd kill yourself?  The road's starting to get to you?  No, no, but I mean, it wouldn't be fair to the others, otherwise I'd choose one.  Oh, God.  No one would go with it.  No one wants to commit.  It wouldn't be fair to the others.  Ugh.  Wouldn't be fair to the others, otherwise I'd choose one.  I like this guy.  This guy, I can tell you're like the peacekeeper in the band, right?  You're like the mellow one.  Listen, man, we're also doing...  This is kind of a side thing.  We're kind of doing this benefit.  Somebody beat up a special needs kid in like Newark, and so we just want you to just say, 
[00:49:30]  you know, just give a shout out to the kids so they know not to beat up somebody with  like, you know, special needs, you know?  So just, you know, just say like, you know, hey guys, you know, it's not cool to beat up  somebody just because they're different or whatever, you know?  Just, you know, just like a quick kind of like a soundbite.  And it's kind of weird, but throw a couple of, you know, bucks in there just because  our fans are kind of retarded, you know what I mean?  So you need to like...  Let me say it.  Like rock and roll, you know?  So just wing it.  Hey guys, this is Peter from Inflames.  You should not treat everybody equally and don't beat anybody up or do something bad 
[00:50:00]  to them just because they're different.  Everybody's the same way.  Okay, that's totally the perfect vibe.  Just throw in special needs and throw in like one or two fucks.  Yeah, the effort.  Yeah, it's kind of...  Like I said, they're retarded.  Same thing again, alright?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, this is Peter from Inflames.  Treat everybody the same way.  Even people who have special needs and everything like that.  Don't fucking go and do any bullshit and start beating people up because they're different.  Treat everybody the same, dude.  That's beautiful. 
[00:50:30]  And the kid's name is Russell.  Just give him a shout out.  Same thing, a couple of fucks.  He's a big metal fan, so it'd mean a lot to him.  That's the kid who got beat up, Russell from Newark.  Hey, Russell.  How the fuck are you doing?  Sorry to cut you in today.  Just take care of yourself, man.  See you soon.  Alright, dude.  That's beautiful, man.  Thanks so much and good luck tonight.  That's beautiful.  Holy shit.  You are insane.  I love how in the same breath...  I wish you could have seen the looks on their face as they're trying to wrap their fucking  head around the concert.  I don't doubt it.  I love how in the same breath you're saying this poor special needs kid, yeah, listen, 
[00:51:00]  there's a fucking retarded.  They use this archaic term like retarded.  Oh.  Oh, wow, Bill.  That's great.  Yeah, that was great.  Just add special needs and throw a fuck in there.  Oh, and they just do it.  Say hi to Russell.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Jimmy Norton returns tomorrow for like four days and then goes back out to Hollywood.  Oh, that's nice.  He's gracing us with a couple of days.  But he's going to be on Jay Lino tonight or he would have been here today.  Oh, big shot.  And Patrice O'Neill filling in for Jimmy Norton.  He just had his HBO special air Friday. 
[00:52:00]  And we're getting raves.  We're getting rave reviews from the fine folks that listen to this program.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  A lot of instant feedback's coming in.  Praising you, Patrice.  Hey, it was a very, very busy sports weekend.  Yes, it was.  Ben.  What happened, Ben?  Ben, what happened?  What happened?  The Red Sox?  Yeah, what happened?  Let's start with the Red Sox.  Let's talk about bases loaded, no outs, and they can't get one run, four to three.  They sucked, so there's no excuse. 
[00:52:30]  I text messaged Ben right when bases were loaded, no outs.  And I go, they cannot blow this one.  Yeah.  And then my next text was, oh, my God, they blew that one.  Yeah, the curse is back, my friend.  It's not back.  I'll tell you what.  It's best that that happened like that, Ben, because it's better than they fought and scratched  and then something retarded happened to cause real pain.  As good as over.  I don't know.  They need a couple of pitchers, man, and they're going to be right back.  That's not a very good follow-up. 
[00:53:00]  They've got to keep Manny.  Please.  They've got to keep Manny.  Manny's amazing.  They've got to get Curt Schilling healthy.  There's going to be, you know, Manny and Ortiz are just ridiculous to have on a ball team.  Ridiculous.  You know, there's a lot of talk.  Manny still wants to be traded, and Damon's going to, you know, the Yankees are probably  going to be interested in Damon.  He's a free agent.  What do you think?  Manny a Yankee?  What do you think?  Pull out the wallet, George.  I'd say more to the Mets, because Ian Payneau are so close buddies.  Yeah.  Wow, that would be a great effort at Mets. 
[00:53:30]  Jesus Christ.  Are you a big Red Sox?  Yeah, yeah.  Big Red Sox, big Pats.  You're from Boston.  Yeah, but I'm not a baseball fan like that.  Yeah.  I kept up with it, because, you know, I was happy for Boston that it happened like that.  Yeah.  You know, but, I mean, just, what do you want?  You know what I mean?  It's like 1918, 2005.  You want back-to-back.  Those motherfuckers wanted a dynasty.  Yeah, it's like, stop.  Stop.  Like, all of a sudden, the Patriots, people are just, it's like, are you joking?  You know how bad the Patriots were my whole life?  Yeah, they stunk up. 
[00:54:00]  You don't have expectations for that.  Yeah.  The Patriots were terrible.  I mean, the Ron Meyer days and all those old days, they were awful.  For decades.  Yes.  Yay!  Now you've got yourself a dynasty.  But now all of a sudden, there's expectations.  It's like, be happy.  Be happy.  You got, what, three or something?  One thing it did with the Sox is now that, you know, you won't hear the chants anymore.  You won't hear any of that, because they did it last year.  But as far as, you know, a follow-up, it would have been nice.  Right, Ben?  Absolutely.  And Anthony texted me, he's like, have you heard from Bill Burr or Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly, nothing. 
[00:54:30]  Bill, Mr. Positive, hey, well, we won it last year.  Right, yeah.  We'll be great next year.  Bob, nothing.  He's able to move on.  That's right.  And then Bill...  I feel the same way, but I feel it, like, on a negative way.  Like, shut up.  You won.  Yeah.  Shut up.  Well, but who's the sports reporter in Boston that's already?  Dan Shaughnessy?  Yeah, he's already saying that the curse is back and stuff.  The curse was destroyed last year when they came back three to zero.  That was to say it is over. 
[00:55:00]  That is worse to a New York fan than any, like, the Bucky Dent or the goofy...  Oh, the Billy Buckner?  Billy Buckner.  They don't want to leave, no doubt.  It extinguished the curse.  There was no doubt.  Like, wow, I got it.  Babe Ruth is in heaven now.  He's not worried anymore.  He's doing what he does.  Drinking and whatever.  Yeah, that curse is done.  Then the Astros pulled it out with that, what, 18-inning game?  Two games.  They played two games.  They played two games.  They got freaking Clemens coming in for four or five innings.  I love Clemens now.  I hope they win. 
[00:55:30]  I hope they win the whole thing.  Clemens is a reliever.  I love the Astros now.  Who has a better chance of beating the Angels?  Well, they had to fly last night after the game.  The Yankees had to fly out to Anaheim.  Yeah.  Play today.  Messina's been out there, though.  He caught it.  Nobody caught it.  We all caught it.  I really hope the Yankees lose.  That'll be nice.  No.  Messina's pitching.  He's been out in L.A.  He's got plenty of rest.  You're wearing a cap, though, aren't you?  Just matching something.  It's the colors.  He said that right in the day.  There's no loyalty.  I understand it's the colors because he comes in here with different color schemes all the time. 
[00:56:00]  It's camouflage logo and camouflage jacket.  But I was thinking that maybe he actually is a Yankee fan.  Well, the New York logo is the best logo going, man.  I mean, it really is the best logo.  That's just a great logo, man.  I know.  See that shit in Hawaii.  I'm not a Yankee fan, but when you see it, you're like, yeah, that is a good logo.  That's just a great logo.  You see some of these other logos, and it's like, oh, yeah.  It's a great logo, man.  People love it.  You think the Yankees got a shot now?  Absolutely got a shot.  That was the game on Friday.  They got a little bit.  Yeah, a little bit. 
[00:56:30]  Just a tad.  Saturday would have been worse, having to go there, but of course they postponed it.  That was your anniversary gift, right?  Yeah.  Not wonderful.  Isn't that nice?  And what did you get?  I went to see you, too, Friday.  Oh, did you get them?  Yeah, fuck yeah.  You got them, right?  I yelled them and screamed until I got them.  I'll admit it.  Because people are like, oh, you know.  He went to you, too.  You know, a lot of people were writing me, you should be thankful that they got you something.  I'm like, fuck that, because I'm a season ticket holder for the Islanders, and they  got me Islander tickets, so that was a waste. 
[00:57:00]  And so I had to tell everyone it was a waste.  Sorry.  Somebody pulled some strings for the Oaster, baby.  Yeah, I had really good seats, too.  I was like the first row after the floor, and they had a pit right in front of us with  the celebrities.  Oh, he was close to that pit.  It was this close to it, not in it.  I was right there.  I was talking to Dennis Leary and everything.  I mean, they were right in front of me.  Oh, Leary was there, too?  Well, it's funny, because there was just this pit right in front of us that was completely  empty, and as the lights go down, as U2's just about ready to hit the stage, all the 
[00:57:30]  celebrities come swooping in from some weird part of the garden that no one gets to see.  So you were next to it, but you had something between you and Dennis Leary.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I just wanted to clear that out.  I'm not saying I was hanging with them.  I was right there.  I just wanted to know what this was.  It was a pen?  Are they a famous group?  I mean, I know U2's famous, but are they a famous group, or are they a really good band?  Like, they're famous.  U2's been at it for 20 years.  Yeah.  Well, some people are famous. 
[00:58:00]  They're really good.  They're not a great band.  No, they're really good, yeah.  If they weren't famous, would you be like, oh, these dudes are good?  No, they've been able to, like, for some reason, yeah, for 20 years, they've been able to keep  current and keep a fan base that's not just like, you know, you go to see an old classic  rock band from 20 years ago, and you go to their show, and it's all old people that were  young when they came out.  U2 is like, you know, they've been able to get new fans as they have.  How do you stay relevant as a fan base?  I don't know.  How the hell are you doing that?  I don't know either, because it's amazing. 
[00:58:30]  Like, the show at the Garden on Friday night, it was a whole new fan base.  Most of the people there were young.  Like, why can't the Temptations, like, do that?  Like, some of these guys, where you go, they just look like old, fat men.  Every once in a while, a band just is able to, you know, continue going.  I don't know.  And so many bands fall by the wayside, you know?  You went by yourself?  I went with my girl.  How was it?  It was great.  We had a great time.  She's a fan, too?  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah.  So, Dennis Leary is there with his family. 
[00:59:00]  Ray Fiennes.  Oh, I pardon you.  Liam Neeson.  And then, I'm kind of pissed off, because I didn't have my digital camera.  Chelsea Clinton was there, like, right in front of me, as close as I am to you, Patrice.  No, ready for this, though?  Like, she broke up with what?  It was fiance?  Yeah, they were.  I think they were good, man.  I don't think she looks as bad as people like what she was.  She's kind of Hillary looking, right?  Nah.  Got a dumpy body.  Nah, not anymore, man.  What?  She's grown up.  She whipped that shit into shape.  She's grown up, dude.  She's burned.  I'll pop Chelsea. 
[00:59:30]  I'm kidding me.  She's burned off some fat, and she's looking good.  I'm telling you.  Are you kidding me?  She's looking good, man.  She just looks good.  I'm telling you, compared to what she used to look like, she is a major, major improvement.  Major.  Wow.  Major.  You wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen with her if she was just a regular girl on the  street.  I'm not talking about the whole fame thing on top of it, that it's a president's daughter.  I am stunned.  If you were walking down the sidewalk and this was your chick, you wouldn't be embarrassed  whatsoever.  I'm stunned.  So she's there with her new guy, and they are like, as they say in the paper, canoodling 
[01:00:00]  and all that crap.  Canoodling.  They like to use that word, canoodling, but she was kissing this guy's hands.  He's got his arms around her, and she's got her head resting on his chest, and she's  kissing him, and during like one by U2, they're going at it.  And I'm like, why the fuck?  Making out tongue.  Did you see him tongue kissing?  Dude, none of the papers have the story yet.  And I mean, it was a big deal when she broke up with this Ian guy.  Yeah.  And now she obviously has a new man. 
[01:00:30]  If I had a digital camera, that photo's got to be worth 10 grand.  Well, that ex-boy was an English guy.  Was he?  Those English dudes.  And that's what happened, is like, she got hot.  What he's saying is, when she went there, she was like Chelsea the ugly Clinton.  Yeah.  And went out there.  Yeah, but she was, you know, when Clinton was in the White House, she had all the ugly  duckling years.  But she was a funny-looking kid thing is one thing.  That's fine.  But then she got older, and I noticed her ass and her legs looked like a mother's. 
[01:01:00]  Big, fat, dumpy, big, fat calves.  But that's why she looks good now, because it's not quite a mother's.  Like, she's going to be a mess like a mother.  Because I used to think Hillary was hot, though, back in the day.  I'm not going to lie.  She's got a meaty stuff going on.  She did have meaty.  A lot of meat on that ass.  I forgot we were talking to a black guy.  Oops, I know.  Jesus.  I'm starting to think you're white like us.  I forgot.  I'm like, delicious meat.  I'm like, you black guys, you look at it a whole different way.  I honestly wasn't seeing color for a while here. 
[01:01:30]  We went the first hour of the show, and I had absolutely forgotten about color.  Yeah.  And then Patrice has to talk, and you know.  Oh, yeah, you're black.  Steps right into a stereotype.  But he said she looked good.  Thanks for reminding us.  Yeah.  I think she looks good, too.  She definitely looks good.  Yeah, you've got to give it to her.  And I'm like, why don't I have my digital camera?  I could be the scumbag with the celebrity photo that everybody wants.  Because I'm telling you, and all these dopes have their cell phones, and they're taking  pictures of her, but they have no idea what they're taking a picture of, that that would 
[01:02:00]  be gold to, like, the New York Post page 6 or something.  You go to the Post for you, Peter Parker?  You go there and sell them the pictures?  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  How much?  You know?  How much for a Chelsea picture?  Especially because they brought all these people in as the lights were going out, you  know?  What do you think you get for a canoodling Chelsea?  I'm thinking $10,000 easily.  10 Gs?  Easily.  You think 10?  Maybe more.  Wow.  Really?  It's her new boyfriend.  Well, when is that going to...  I mean, I don't...  You watch.  It's going to hit the papers in another day or two, because, like, people are starting 
[01:02:30]  to like...  People still care, you think?  Yeah, they're talking now.  You watch.  It'll hit the paper by tomorrow, Wednesday.  Where'd the Bush girls go?  Where'd they disappear?  Where'd they drop off the face of the earth to?  They disappeared.  They were in the news all the time.  And that's why they disappeared.  They sent me somewhere.  Drinking, sticking their tongues out in the limos at the press.  Yeah.  Looking all hot.  Daddy Bush had him killed.  Yeah.  Bringing embarrassment to the family.  Embarrassing the family.  Yeah, but the U2 show... 
[01:03:00]  Not good for America.  The U2 show was just amazing.  You know, I can't answer that question, Patrice.  They still...  Like how?  They still put out great songs.  They're more of a pop band than they've ever been.  And people can't stand...  A lot of people can't stand his politics.  You know, because he's very political and stuff.  And you're like, shut up already.  Yeah, he's taking it so seriously.  So to actually transcend that with your music to where people go, you know, I can't stand  this guy as a person, but I can't fucking stop him.  But at the concert, he acknowledges that. 
[01:03:30]  He turns to the crowd and he goes, thanks for listening to me.  I know I can be a pain in the ass.  Yeah.  And now he's well-loved after he says that.  Like, I'm sorry, folks.  Self-deprecating comment like that.  But how's the Rolling Stones still doing it?  They're still great, too.  That's another band that even kids go to their shows.  Not for any new shit that they're recording.  It's all the old stuff.  They want to hear the old stuff.  Yeah, so that's the difference.  Like the Rolling Stones, when they put out a new album, even though the latest album by  the Rolling Stones got really good reviews, as a Stones fan, I still haven't listened 
[01:04:00]  to it.  I could care less.  No, I want to go see Sympathy for the Devil.  Right, but you're going to hear the hits.  Yeah, you can't always get...  I mean, I want to hear the shit, man.  I don't want to be at that concert as they're wasting time playing their new stuff.  I could care less.  But with you, too, I want to hear the new stuff.  But what about the OJs, who had a million hits, and they played to just old people who  loved them back then.  Back then.  Like, how did some of these bands...  Rod Stewart is not one of those old, no-one-cares guys. 
[01:04:30]  These people still go to see him.  Yeah, he'd be invented themselves.  I think it's if you still...  You don't look like you're going to drop dead mid-set, and you can still pump the song  up.  That's right.  Like, Mick can still sing those songs.  Dude, I was at Giant Stadium for the Stones show.  I could not believe it.  He's 60-something years old.  He was running around like he was in his early 30s.  It was unbelievable.  The Who still packs places.  Unbelievable.  This is because Roger Daltrey can get out there, move around, and sing the songs.  Well, how about Elton?  He's just a little chubby sissy.  He's a faggot. 
[01:05:00]  Right?  He's just a little chubby sissy, and people love him.  He'll pack a place out, too.  How does that happen?  But then you think you're getting, you know...  You've got to stay relevant.  It's all about image and marketing, and the Rolling Stones understand that.  Mick Jagger understands that.  It's a fellow winger show.  Right.  Mick Jagger understands...  Pip winger.  Mick Jagger understands marketing, you know, and understands image.  And you, too, certainly does.  So it was a really good show.  It was an amazing show.  From beginning to end, you didn't sit down once.  You know how most bands, you know, they finally give you a break to like, 
[01:05:30]  all right, we're going to play two or three shitty songs so you can rest your fanny  and sit down for a while?  Everyone sits.  You see them filing out to get a drink or something.  That's always great at a concert because, like, every band wants to just...  come out and just, you know, knock you off your feet, as they say, right?  And then, like, 20 minutes into it, they start into a song,  and you're still hoping, like, the energy's still there,  and then you watch the arena, and everyone's slowly starting to sit down.  They're, like...  Sitting down and filing to take that piss and get that beer.  It's the sitting down phase of the show. 
[01:06:00]  All right, I'm going to sit for two or three songs.  That was known as the drum solo back in the day.  Right, right.  So they killed the whole...  Killed.  How many hits do they have?  They have...  Wow.  That's what sucks about a band like you, too.  You're going to go away disappointed in a way if you're a fan  because there's going to always be a ton of songs you wish they would have played.  They can't play all of them.  They can't play all of them.  Same with the Stones, you know?  Yeah.  So you hope they just pick out a bunch of cool songs.  What did they do, three hours, the band, or two hours?  Two hours.  They did about two, right?  I mean, the great thing with both the Stones tour and the U2 tour  is they mix up the set every night. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, there's five to six different songs every night.  So it's kind of cool.  And I got a word to all the bands out there.  The encore thing is just...  It's been dead for a couple decades now.  Let's stop.  Yeah, enough with it.  Let's stop with a good night.  Thanks for coming, Ezra.  Thanks for coming, yay.  And then you got to sit there for a while while they jerk off backstage.  Someone has to come up with something new because it's such a joke at this point.  Oh, look, they're coming back.  Oh, I thought the show was over.  What a surprise.  I thought it was over, but here they come.  Holy shit.  That's right.  This is so cool. 
[01:07:00]  I thought the music was done, and I had seen the last of these guys.  Well, here's something, Vincent.  Maybe they should just walk away through the crowd.  Goodbye, everybody.  And then get to the exit, and people go, no!  And then one of them just puts both hands at the door and turns around like,  come on back, fellas.  All right, the people want us.  All right, we're doing one more.  Does anyone know who started with the encore?  That would be interesting.  Because now it's just like every band gets the encore,  even if you sucked up there.  It had to be some...  They loved us. 
[01:07:30]  What should we do?  Go home?  They're still out there.  What do you think?  Let's just go back out and do another song.  But we don't have any other songs to do.  Well, there was that time we covered that old blues song.  Yeah, but now like Bono...  It had to be way back then.  Bono's basically saying, thank you, New York.  And you're like, what do you mean, thank you?  You've got at least another half hour to go.  I'm not stupid.  Stop with that crap. 
[01:08:00]  And then they make believe that they might come out again,  but that's just so the band can leave and beat the traffic back to their hotel.  Well, people do want them back.  I never understand a word they're saying either from the stage,  and I don't know how the crowd responds to it.  I'm in New York.  It's a large show market.  It's a large show market.  It's a large show market.  You know what I'm doing?  And people are cheering like, yeah.  I'm just always there going, what the fuck did he say?  What?  So there was a bunch of filthy Irish performers there,  a bunch of Irish celebrities.  It was all soccer hooligans. 
[01:08:30]  Was it all just white people?  Yeah, but Liam Neeson.  Actually, I had a couple of times.  Adam Farrell was there.  I had a couple of times.  Fighting Irish stance.  Put them up, you bloody motherfucker.  And it's great when they, like U2's song is,  I saw Coldplay too recently, but with U2 it was the song one,  and then you'll look around and you go,  oh, I guess this isn't just our song.  I guess it's everybody's song.  I thought I was the only one that discovered one  as a good romantic song for me and my lady. 
[01:09:00]  So they're playing our song.  It's Chelsea's song too.  Yeah, you look around Massa Square Garden  and everyone is holding their woman for one.  It's Liam Neeson's song.  Why can't these people pick another U2 song?  I thought this one was mine.  How good was Vertigo Live?  It was a really good one.  It was amazing, dude.  I'm telling you.  I like that song.  I do like that song.  Absolutely amazing.  And now they're starting to,  they're thinking about making a deal with iTunes U2  where you could get their concerts for $9.99 a pop. 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  That would be a great, great business.  So you download the entire,  what would be the live album of the performance that you saw.  Rumor has it they're in negotiation with iTunes  to do exactly that.  Can you imagine?  So now if you're in like Cleveland and you saw U2,  you could download their performance in Cleveland,  their live show, or their live show in New York.  They don't need any more money,  but can you imagine the money maker that this is for a band like U2  that has a catalog?  Because all you would have to do to make this work,  like they're playing Madison Square Garden, what, 
[01:10:00]  four or five nights on this run?  Well, this is the start of a seven-night run,  but they're coming back.  Yeah.  All right.  So say they do seven nights at Madison Square Garden, right?  Jesus.  Finally goes up there and makes sure every night  there's like five or six different songs, let's say,  because they have a catalog where they can do that.  Now you as a huge U2 fan,  you're sitting home on your iTunes and you're like,  fuck, I need all seven performances at Madison Square Garden  at $9.99 a pop.  It's $70.  And then you're like, well, I want their show when they played,  you know, Dublin, let's say, and Boston. 
[01:10:30]  Yep.  I mean, I'm a huge U2 fan.  I would be downloading concerts left and right for $9.99 a pop.  It's the wave of the future, my friend.  16,000 people?  18.  18,000.  How many sellouts could he just...  They could keep going.  How many days are there?  Every single show on the tour is sold out instantly.  They could probably do...  Isn't that amazing?  They could probably do another five or six in New York, no problem,  but they just don't have enough dates.  They've got to move on to the rest of the country and other places.  That's probably the only reason they're not just camping out at Madison Square Garden. 
[01:11:00]  That is an uber band.  Uber band.  And then I just, really fast, so then the U2 show ended,  and I went to BB King's to see Anthony's brother's U2 tribute band.  Not 2U!  I always...  Yeah, the website is notutu.com.  Notutu.com, yeah.  And then their band is 2U, right?  Yeah.  And Brother Joe is on guitar.  He throws the wool cap on to look like Edge.  For all the poor bastards that couldn't make it to the show.  But he does it as a goof, like, all right, I'll play Edge. 
[01:11:30]  I mean, not as a goof, because he's playing and everything's amazing,  but he's just, like, stepping into the role for two hours, right?  But his lead singer looks, acts, and talks like Bono.  It's scary.  Yeah.  Absolutely scary.  What's the respect level of a tribute band in the business to other people,  other musicians?  Like, if I was Bono, I would have, as a goof,  just went to BB King's and walked on stage just to freak out everybody.  Yeah, that would have been something.  Can you imagine?  It's like a cruise ship comic?  The, uh...  I think to the serious musicians... 
[01:12:00]  Here's how it plays out.  The fans of the band love it,  because they go down to the clubs and see it.  The musicians that have been in the business for a while  understand it and appreciate that there is money to be made there.  The people that poo-poo it are the young musicians that are,  you know, I'm writing my own stuff, man.  I'm, you know, I'm going to make it, and I'm getting a record deal.  They look at it like the cruise ship comic and things like that.  Until you're beaten and just bludgeoned by the business long enough  to realize that it's a one in a quadrillion shot 
[01:12:30]  of actually making it with your own stuff.  And, uh, you know, my brother was one of those guys years ago.  We used to be in bands, and we'd write shit and play shit.  His brother?  And we were always right on the brink, man.  I owe this guy down at fucking Atlantic Records,  knows us, and we're going to send him this.  You don't hear shit back.  And then after a while, you've got to turn a buck.  And now he's making more money with this band  than he's made with any other project he's ever done  since he started playing guitar combined. 
[01:13:00]  And he's, uh, he's flying all over the country.  They fly him all over.  He just played Puerto Rico.  Yeah.  They're flying to Mexico.  Yeah.  They're fucking flying all over the United States.  This band is in huge demand.  Let me ask you to do Richard Pryor, um, cover.  Wouldn't that be great if comics could do a comic cover?  I'm going to get on a treadmill.  I can't.  Got to look the part a little bit.  Jesus.  What the fuck, dude? 
[01:13:30]  Nipsey Russell tribute band.  What happened to Nipsey?  Didn't get stung by a bee?  What happened?  Nipsey's one of those guys you thought were dead anyway.  Like, it wasn't a big surprise.  But anyway, just to finish up, um, I got to, I got to give props to Brother Joe.  He's an amazing guitarist.  He's, he's unbelievable.  I would put, I would put him up against almost anybody out there.  Yeah.  That's how good he is on guitar.  And then he's, he found, what's, I forgot the lead singer's name.  It's, uh, what's his name? 
[01:14:00]  No, he's, he's going to kill me.  I forgot his name, but it slips my mind.  I know his name.  It's unbelievable.  And just a point I want to make.  So then I leave the garden and go to BB King's.  And I felt like it was an extension of the U2 show.  They were that good.  And then they're playing all the stuff that, uh, the real U2 didn't get to at Madison Square Garden.  I had, I had a blast.  Now, I sat there for the whole set.  I said, I'd never do that for like two hours.  Now, is the brother, is that band, is that, is your brother now, you know, edge? 
[01:14:30]  Is, is he sneaking, trying to do, be big still in his own right?  No, no.  It's not like that.  Some tribute bands are, they're all crazy people.  And they really take on the persona of, of everybody in the band.  And it's kind of scary.  Uh, but no, these guys realize it's, it's really a money making venture.  They take the music, you know, they take the playing of the music seriously.  They sound like U2.  Uh, my brother buys, he's got the same equipment that the band uses. 
[01:15:00]  So it sounds exactly like the band.  You know, the guitar sounds exactly like it.  Amazing.  And, uh, the singer is amazing.  Amazing, yeah.  I saw them a year ago and they were really good back then.  But now, they're on, uh, they're on a crazy level, man.  They segged into each song.  Well, how much less money?  Okay, they don't make as much as U2, but, like, they're making a good living now.  How much money do you make doing that?  I honestly don't know what they're making, but, uh, yeah, they, they, they make a really  good living.  It's, uh.  Six figures at least?  A year?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, uh, they're going to play our Halloween party on Halloween night at the Hard Rock Cafe.  So, we got them, we got them and two other tribute bands playing on Halloween night for  us.  And what do the bands think?  Like, guys, what is, what do U2 think of tribute bands?  I don't know.  I guess they, you know, they got to get a kick out of it.  Yeah.  Yeah, they probably get a little kick out of it.  I'd be surprised if Bono doesn't know about, uh, you know.  Are you, is your brother the, the, uh, preeminent, you know, tribute band for U2? 
[01:16:00]  Um, yeah.  Yeah, pretty much now.  Definitely.  Yeah, pretty much.  They've beat out just about everybody.  There's a bunch of U2 tribute bands out there, but, uh, they're, they're moving right to  the top, these guys.  Right to the top.  Do we have a, no, tribute band.  Go figure.  And why can't comics do that?  It's so accepted with bands.  Well, they do it a lot, but it's called just stealing.  At least go, hey, I'm doing one of my favorites by Patrice O'Neal.  This is a little ditty by Jim Norton.  Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah. 
[01:16:30]  That'd be funny, though.  You get, like, some guy who just, uh, looks like Jimmy.  Yeah.  And gets up there and does, does Jimmy's act.  Why not?  Toy the country, be it places he can't.  Nimi Jordan.  Exactly.  Come on out, get out of it.  Nimi.  Not Jimmy.com.  Yeah.  Patrice, listen to this.  He's your brother.  Is it?  Yeah.  Hold on.  This is live, right?  This is live, right?  This is live, right? 
[01:17:00]  This is live.  This is live, right?  This is live.  it's a bad recording obviously that's just live in a club yeah it's just like a microphone uh in 
[01:17:30]  the middle of the crowd unfortunately yeah we've been asking for some of his studio stuff for a  while now yeah i know send it in you bastard can you put an album out like that uh a tribute album  you can't um you can't make money off of uh uh recordings i think that's the whole thing  you could go play it live and shit like that but once you start recording then there's a problem 
[01:18:00]  yeah you gotta get a um this doesn't one of the studio ones brother joe you gotta help us out  i want some studio stuff nipsey russell died of stomach cancer that's a fun way to go huh  anyway so brother joe and the the two you unbelievable and they will be uh playing the 
[01:18:30]  halloween party and i had uh no filter paul and his wife denise and big a buying me beers all night  oh jesus there's something going on with uh paul denise and big a i'm convinced of it yeah yeah i  don't know what it is i think there's sex going on oh i think there's some kind of group sex thing  going on with paul denise and big a and i have to go on record and say that oh oh there is some  shenanigans going on there is something going on with those three here's i am convinced now here's 
[01:19:00]  what i was told all right i was told that big a calls paul's wife all the time they're constantly  on the phone there's something going on and uh that's the only thing i know i don't know about  any but they were hanging out all three dancing as uh to you were we're playing at bb kings  dude i can't even it's such a twisted sick image it can't even conjure in my mind thank god and big 
[01:19:30]  a was dancing with denise as paul was looking on something's going on there do the a little  swinging another one a little swinging and it's scary to see it's scary to see big a with a beer  bottle in his hand it looks so fucking tiny was that true she's his uh webmaster for his new  website well big a now has a website of course he does he's blown up because of our radio showing  up i think the link's on opianthony.com it's pretty disturbing but thanks for the beers uh paul  i i snuck you out of there so i wasn't able to thank you do you honestly think there's a 
[01:20:00]  menage going on there oh yeah no down my mind no doubt wait a wait wait why on earth there's  something going on out of everybody on this earth why would they pick big a i think they pick many  people really you think it's just whoever kind of i'm probably pissing them off right now but i i  have some probably i have some hunches you're accusing his wife of having sex with big a that's 
[01:20:30]  right that's right that's what i say now wow that's rough so what's up he's gasping you just  read something and gasped you're right what's that i don't want to step on any news that's all i just  was reading something real quick that's all right what are you reading this prostitution this drug  this mexican prostitute thing i missed that one all right hold on we'll get to that in a second  oh yeah we got paul turn your workbook to page hey paul here he is paul there's nothing going on 
[01:21:00]  andrew wishes i don't wish oh andrew andrew it's not you oh okay okay big a wishes that there was  something going on with your wife i don't know i think he's my wife's the only woman that's like  ever talked to him except his mom and he's getting issues now what do you mean he's getting issues what  kind of issues he just can't leave her alone he just calls her all the time he calls her all the  time but there's nothing going on that we live like ninety miles away and uh and all the doors 
[01:21:30]  are going to let him come this far you know you know he's going to kill her eventually right i'm  convinced that would you like to talk to her because she's in love with him i think paul yes i saw it  i i was watching you guys a little bit did you see me drag my wife away every time i was watching a  little bit because you were buying me beers and i i want to thank you i wasn't able to thank you at  the club because we snuck out i didn't buy you nothing let me clear that one all right yeah it was  all you but uh big a and uh and your lovely wife there denise they were dancing you were looking on  like all right okay hello this is it's fun for one dance but not for a whole set yeah exactly you 
[01:22:00]  know what here she is you can ask her hold on all right oh my god hello hi denise how are you  good how are you good so what's going on with you and big a he's just a friend why is paul laughing  really loud well i don't know because he's got this thick obsession in his mind that like andrew  is like totally in love with me well i think there's something well you know what you're doing  you're kind of leading him on well i don't think i'm leading him on because i mean i've i've strictly 
[01:22:30]  like spoken to him you know whenever paul's had any kind of conflicts about it i mean i've always just  told him look you know paul's getting jealous this and that and we're just friends i mean he  hasn't really had any friends i think this whole thing with the big a and and you know the show  has really you know taken him and it's more of just an encouragement you know to make him feel  better about himself we love giving the uh giving the hopeless people um a reason to live 
[01:23:00]  yep exactly a life an existence a social life hey uh you guys going to the halloween party right  you bet you bet did you guys decide what you're going to be well yeah actually i'm not so sure  about me but we have a costume for paul yeah what is it uh black penis he's going as a black penis  yeah see patrice we're doing this halloween party but you got to come dressed as something that has 
[01:23:30]  something to do with the show a little different twist okay some of the things we've talked about  over the last so would the black penis be because uh you uh had sex with a black man in a bathroom  yeah while your husband was downstairs waiting for you yeah hey and i didn't have sex i don't know  this woman but she's just some codependency going on she's keeping this this weirdo around to make  her husband jealous or something yeah she don't think he's jealous enough or something jealous  enough well you want to know something it's working oh really is it she didn't deny it paul usually is 
[01:24:00]  so full of himself okay that yeah i admit you know big a and i've become friends you know i mean  he treats me like a woman she's using big a yeah okay he treats me like a woman and hey if it takes  someone like him to open up paul's eyes so be it here's her logic patrice by the way here's a little  death this is going to somebody's going to die behind this behind behind woman chicanery here's her  little uh uh here's her logic she was uh at some event with paul sitting down she goes to the 
[01:24:30]  bathroom this black guy who happened to be a soap star in england uh walks up to her and kind of pins  her against the wall so she knows that he's going to rape her so she lets him rape to fend off the  rape drops to her knees and sucks him off so you were saving your life good girl  in a friggin bathroom stall there was nowhere to go oh did you hear this nowhere but down  in your face what are you going to do do you hear this or are you going to scream when there's nobody

[01:34:00]  pissing in my pants the whole entire weekend i kept playing that over and over and over and now  every time when he pisses me off that's what's going to be making me laugh again yeah he looks like  a psychopath psychopath yeah i mean it showed his true colors is it true that big a was there too  but he chickened out actually you know what both of them were and but i was you know i had a really  bad cold and paul had me out in the friggin range for 45 minutes right and once explain what happened  by the way you guys were on your way to bb king's when all this went down bb king's and you know we 
[01:34:30]  were walking around a little bit and we came to the end of the corner there was a a whole setup of you  know fox news so like you know right away paul's like oh you know attack on the media and all so  we're we're sitting and we're waiting and we're waiting and um you know the guy was there doing  his um report writing up and all and the next thing you know you know they started you know  turning the lights on and stuff and i got pissed well i got pissed at paul i took off big a like i'm  not going in i'm not doing it you know i want to see big a do an assault on the media i think that'd be 
[01:35:00]  hilarious right uh... who have been lol  and  well back to you in the studio often  hamburgers packed it up and and he's still out there  vans pulling away and there you go 
[01:35:30]  it's not that b  Well, like I said, I wasn't there when they did it, so Paul's got the rest of it.  Thank God.  All right, take care.  All right, thanks, Denise.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, guys.  Wow, did we learn from that conversation with Denise?  Rape is erotic?  Right.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, that's what she said.  It was erotic.  Now it's not rape anymore.  Sexy.  Now she's willingly blowing black guys in the bathroom while you wait for her.  I think that if you look at Big 8 dental hygiene, you can imagine his cock must be pretty dark.  I think that's probably what it is. 
[01:36:00]  That cocked up.  All right, Paul, so you did an assault on the media.  Yes.  It was Greta's show there, right?  Greta Van Sustrand.  She had thrown it to one of her cohorts.  Oh, faceless chick.  Greta Van Sustrand.  Yes, it was great.  On Fox News, and guess what, my friend?  You're the leader as far as the assault on the media contest goes for October.  We got the MiFi up for grabs and a trip to the studio to see the show, but you can pretty much do that anytime you want, I guess. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, I think if I do win it, I'm going to pass it off to the second place guy.  All right.  And we got other prizes that we're going to be announcing soon, hopefully.  So walk us through this assault on the media.  Okay, so we get there like 10 to 10, and we're trying to figure out if it's Fox News or Fox Channel 5 in New York.  Right.  We're hoping it's not 5 because, you know, we wanted to get something national.  That was my challenge.  I had to find a national TV crew.  I'm watching the video, so if you hear me laugh, it's just because it's just too funny.  But go ahead. 
[01:37:00]  So anyway, we were trying to avoid eye contact with like any of the staff, but Big A kept saying to me,  So that bitch is looking at me.  I'm not going anywhere.  That bitch is looking at me.  So just as I went live, they had a couple of producers that you actually see the one producer stick his head in.  Yeah.  But they're like on either side of the shot, so there's like a clear shot to the street.  Right.  And to the right of the lady that's blocking my, I guess, left side, there was like a little kid who kept sticking her head in.  So every time she'd stick her head in, there'd be this gap that I was looking at. 
[01:37:30]  And so I waited for the little kid to like stick her head in for like the third time, and I just dove in.  Yeah.  And, you know, open out the XM radio, and by the time I got radio out, my arm was getting dragged,  and she actually dragged me right into the back of the guy.  You know, they're doing a, the only way I can describe this, they're obviously doing another story on the whole subway thing.  Yeah.  Which is starting to look like it was all made up or something, because I, you know, we're not seeing shit.  Yeah, of course.  It was supposed to be Sunday, strollers. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, Sunday, strollers.  And I think it's all about the mayor wanting to be re-elected personally.  He's a fucking ass.  Because most people don't want to re-elect, elect someone new when there's a...  Crisis.  There's crises going on.  But anyway, so they're doing a story on the subway thing.  You come running into the frame, and it looks like you're screaming,  There's a bomb on the subway!  Yeah.  Like, you're losing your mind.  Yeah, you really kind of put a lot into it.  Like, it looks like you're sweating profusely, your hair is just a mess, 
[01:38:30]  and you have crazy eyes as you're screaming to Opie and Anthony on XM satellite radio.  Look at this.  We're playing for Patrice.  And then what happens?  You're in the middle of doing the assault on the media, and then they, what, pull you out of frame?  Well, I don't know if you want to play the C-word a lot, but this C-word rips my arm and just drags me out of the shot.  It actually looks like I'd, like, look to the guy across that sticks his head in, and I'm scared, but actually I'm getting dragged.  A girl pulled you out?  It's a big, butch, bulldike-looking bitch. 
[01:39:00]  A girl?  A girl.  Two guys in the truck, yeah.  And then you're, like, in shock that someone's actually pulling you away from live TV, and now you're like, you don't know what the hell to do.  Well, I tried to get back in, but if you listen right after I get pulled out, you hear, fuck you, that's assault.  Get your hands off me.  Oh, really?  Did that make live TV?  If you turn up really loud, yeah, you can hear it.  And then a producer, like, pokes his head into the live shot from the other side.  Well, he was the guy that was on the left side, though.  I was thinking he was going to come across and help push me out.  I was hoping that was what would happen. 
[01:39:30]  That's what's great.  He goes into the frame, like, I wonder if the other lady needs help.  And then he realizes the situation's under control, so he walks back out of the frame.  He backed out of the shot.  The video's up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  He's like, oh, God, it's a boss.  Yeah, it looked like something serious.  Oh, yeah, the two producers jumped out of the truck.  Right.  And just a second, they're coming over.  The woman's like, that's not cool.  We're covering the terrorism story.  Right.  Oh.  And I'm like, I didn't fucking curse.  I didn't break any rules. 
[01:40:00]  What is your problem?  And I wanted to say this is total bullshit.  Trust me, it's totally cool because the fear they have thrown at us the last, like, three or four days,  it's that it's more than justified.  Terrorism.  Next time I do it, I'll shave my goatee.  I won't look like I'm a bomb.  Close down half a Penn Station for a soda can.  Yeah.  It's a goddamn soda can.  Yeah.  That's what we're doing these days here in New York.  And then you got stupid Geraldo.  Wasn't he in the subways over the weekend going, well, I'm here,  and at any moment they're saying that a bomb could explode? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, he is such a...  He's so dramatic.  The drama, the fake, he's got to be where the danger is.  Yeah, that's his new thing.  Can't stand Geraldo.  Because of Hurricane Rita, he's like, I ain't leaving.  And they're all laughing, like, well, be safe, Geraldo, you idiot.  But I tell you, if there's any, if there is any, are any peaceful Arabs,  innocent ones in this whole thing, they better start yapping.  Because if these ones pull off something like this, man,  they're going to just ship them all out. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, yeah.  Then they all got to go, right?  They're all going to go.  All of you.  It's time to build the camps if that happens.  This is not England.  Time to build the camps.  This is not desert.  They're not going to have it.  We fly over.  We go to L.A.  You see all that desert down there?  Time to build the camps in the desert.  Internment.  Internment camps.  Time to build.  Right there.  Happens once you watch.  This whole shit.  If they pull off some type of train bombing,  and I'm telling you, Arabs who love this country,  they've got to start sticking their goofy heads up and letting people know. 
[01:41:30]  Open up your ears.  Catch some little chitter chatter that's going on.  Some chit-chat and report it.  Because if a train blows up, Patrice is absolutely right.  All of these are going.  That's right.  Just like England.  Get out.  Chinese cab drivers.  What?  Yeah.  What?  Where you go?  Yeah.  What?  Driving all slow and badly.  Let's just finish this up,  because we have the audio of Paul just looking like a psychopath on Fox News.  The reporter turns to the left like,  what the hell's going on once again? 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  He was smooth, though.  He didn't lose his mind, either.  No.  Most of the reporters don't lose their minds.  No, what's your fucking problem, man, or nothing.  We had a bunch of assaults on the media in the last couple days  because of this subway thing.  But Paul's in the lead, and here's the audio.  The video, obviously, much better.  You've got to go to opandanthony.com.  I've watched the video, Paul, at least 20 to 30 times.  I can't get enough of this one.  My wife has the neighbors coming over to watch it.  I made a DVD.  All right, right on.  She's going to fuck them?  A little bit more to the story, actually.  Oh, yeah, go ahead. 
[01:42:30]  When the two guys jumped out of the truck, one of them goes,  I know who you are, and then he said, Paul,  and then they made a human shield so I couldn't get back into the shop.  That's what the guy was trying to look at.  Oh, really?  I tried to get back because someone had just told me that Opie was offering  the old $200 for the Fox News moon.  Right.  So I was trying to get back, but there was no hope.  A lot of security on national shots.  Yeah, I know that.  But you did great.  I think that's the first national assault in a while, so congratulations, Paul.  Here's the audio, listen, listen closely. 
[01:43:00]  Todd Conner, Joyce is live from New York Times Square.  Todd?  Greta.  Hey there, Greta.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending his day defending his actions to make the threat public  and also to flood the city subways with thousands of police officers and extra security saying  he would rather err on the side of caution.  Of course, my subways also being rather cautious today,  reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items.  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown. 
[01:43:30]  I think I hear very, very low in the background.  Fuck you.  You're right.  Wow.  But you just screamed it like a freaking lunatic.  And it sounds like he was saying it the second time and it ended with like a punch in the face.  Just abruptly end.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like he's screaming, you know, I saw a UFO, we're all going to die.  Like he's just one of those crazy people.  They're coming.  They're coming for us.  That just appears out of nowhere with some ridiculous news.  The bean pods.  Right, right.  One more time before we move on. 
[01:44:00]  It's Paul and his assault on the media.  He's the leader for October.  Let's listen closely at the end to see if we can hear fuck you.  Todd Conner joins us live from New York Times Square.  Todd?  Hey there, Greta.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg is spending his day defending his actions to make the threat public  and also to flood the city subways with thousands of police officers and extra security saying  he would rather err on the side of caution.  Of course, May's subways also being rather cautious today. 
[01:44:30]  Reporters reporting countless abandoned bags and other suspicious items.  This bag found on train tracks in Midtown.  Police closing.  I don't know.  Yeah, it could be.  It's slight, I guess.  We're going to have to take that tape to the lab.  The Opie Anthony lab and see if it doesn't fuck you.  You got to get that reporter credit, too.  He didn't even skip up.  No.  He did turn his head, though, like, what the heck is this?  But he just kept plowing right through.  Yeah.  And, by the way, today in Manhattan, New York City, here, if you are here, parade. 
[01:45:00]  The Columbus Day parade.  Oh, no.  It's huge and live coverage.  It is national coverage.  Cameras all up and down, I believe, what is that, Fifth Avenue?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, yeah.  One more time.  So, we are, yeah, you got to get out of Dodge, man.  It's going to start at, just leave after the show.  You'll be fine.  Oh, God, no.  At noon.  They already stopped blocking those.  I got a fucking meeting today at 1.30, and it's going to be, I should have just stayed in.  The meeting should have been at 11.15. 
[01:45:30]  It still would have, yeah, I know.  From 11, no, 11.05 to 11.10.  You know, whatever.  And then I'm out across Fifth Avenue.  Let's say goodbye to Paul.  So, Paul, thank you.  No problem, guys.  Looking forward to Jimmy coming back tomorrow.  What?  Looking forward to Jimmy coming back tomorrow.  Yeah, Jimmy's back tomorrow.  He's on Jay Leno tonight for everybody.  And check out NoFilterPaul.com.  NoFilterPaul.com.  Everyone's got their website.  All right.  I had to outdo Big A's.  Paul, you're in the lead.  Thank you, guys.  Assault on the Media Contest. 
[01:46:00]  Without a doubt, Paul and his psycho ways in the lead.  Thank you, Paul.  Big A, thanks.  Well, take care.  We'll see you Friday, Big A.  How many fucking minutes is he ever done with his cell phone plans?  He's a star.  Big A is radio gold.  Of course.  All right, Big A.  Take care.  All right.  Paul's site.  All right, there he goes.  Look at Paul's site.  Huh?  Everyone's got a website.  Everyone has websites, man.  Look at Paul's website. 
[01:46:30]  Look, he's been on our show twice.  He's got a website now.  He's got a website.  NoFilterPaul.com.  I'm waiting for the guys to start their own websites because they got in with a phone  call once.  How do these guys do this?  What am I doing wrong?  They're all just...  And they get hits on their sites.  Yeah.  They get their personalities now.  Yeah, like...  It's great.  I don't know how it happens.  God bless you all.  It's that whole pest mentality.  They're just taking over.  Is that me photoshopped in?  No, that's you.  Oh, I'm actually...  All right.  It looked weird.  Why don't we take a break, Ant? 
[01:47:00]  Right out.  And we'll continue with the dog's story.  The story that made Patrisco...  Patrisco...  It looked like it might have been old.  I might have did it.  I didn't, you know...  And Ben?  Anything, Ben?  We never covered football.  Football.  Football.  Yeah.  Of course.  How did...  Pats won.  Had it.  350 yards from Tom Brady.  350.  And my Jets.  I love my Jets.  Vinny.  What can I tell you?  163 yards.  Pulls it off.  Vinny Testaverde actually pulled it off. 
[01:47:30]  Amazing.  He looked good, too.  Yeah, he's got a good arm.  All right, there you go.  We covered sports.  Football.  Eagles, Ben.  Eagles looked awful.  What's wrong with the Eagles?  I have no idea.  Bledsoe at 289 yards.  33 to 10.  Bledsoe's doing very well for the Cowboys this season, so far.  Did Tyson ever get picked up?  I called him over the weekend, because he called me again.  We're playing phone tag.  A good friend of the show, Tyson Walter, he was the center for the Cowboys, and something  happened.  We still haven't gotten to the bottom of that.  He got released, which is ridiculous, because no one saw that coming, and he was trying 
[01:48:00]  out with the Patriots, actually, a couple days ago.  Oh, that would be cool.  The champions.  The champions.  Yes, yes.  It's a little hard to concentrate on football when your baseball team's still in it.  I like watching that doughy-ass Posada run around the bases last night.  He did very good last night.  To wrap up our sports break, did anyone see the golf?  No, I heard it was tragic for Daly. 
[01:48:30]  You could care less, right?  No.  It was Tiger Woods and John Daly in the end, right?  John Daly, who just loves to smoke.  He's sneaking puffs in between shots.  Was he?  And if he could, he would be drinking, but I think he's in the program finally.  Yeah.  But he's just a fat mess.  He was real bad with the booze in.  Oh, yeah.  And every time he's up there in the leaderboard, you've got to root for the guy.  He's unbelievable.  He's the guy you just want to win.  You just pull for him like crazy, right?  And even golf, they're all in shape now.  Golf was the last sport where they were fat guys. 
[01:49:00]  And bowling.  And bowling.  And they didn't really care.  But now all the golf guys are now not a pound of fat on him.  Working out.  Working out in between tournaments and stuff.  But Daly's still old school.  Just big old belly.  He can barely swing the club because his belly gets in the way.  And he still fucking kicks ass.  So it comes down to Daly and Tiger Woods.  And they've got to go to a playoff.  Sudden death playoff, right?  So they play the 18th hole again.  And they both par.  So now they go back to, I guess, 16.  And to make a long story short, they both have birdie shots, basically, 
[01:49:30]  because they're off the green a little bit.  And Tiger Woods misses his and taps in.  And, oh, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, and then Daly's turn.  So if he makes it, he wins, right?  He misses.  He's about three feet past the cup.  So now you're thinking, all right, he's going to tap in.  They're going to go to another sudden death hole.  All of a sudden he goes up, looks at the putt.  He takes his time.  Misses like a three-foot fucking putt in front of everybody.  In front of everybody.  Misses a three-footer.  And they even had a camera on Tiger Woods.  And in most cases, you know, in that situation, you don't give a fuck. 
[01:50:00]  You just know you won the tournament.  So you're like you're really, you know, very happy.  The shot that they had at Tiger Woods as he's winning the tournament  because Daly fucked up, he was like, oh, he was even pulling for him.  Like, dude, don't fucking, I don't want to win this way,  especially against you that has had all this heartache over the years in your career.  He, like, looked down like, oh, I can't believe he just missed that putt, you know.  And Daly blew it, basically.  Three-footer.  Blew a three-footer.  Three-footer to keep it going, and he missed a damn thing.  Oops. 
[01:50:30]  And everyone fell for him like, oh, my God, dude.  Tiger wins another one.  Tiger wins another one.  There you go.  God bless him.  God bless him.  All right, we'll continue with the O&A program.  Golfing is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon.  A true test of dexterity, skill, and, oh, seems to have landed in some dog mess.  Oh, not again.  Ramone, wash my balls.  Give it to me.  We are out of charge, yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Never get it enough.  We are out of charge, yeah.  Hell yeah.  All right, here's the deal.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We like to call it the O&A virus.  It's spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Thank you.  This show's like a virus, right, Patrice?  Yes.  Patrice filling in for Jimmy Norton.  Jim Norton will be back tomorrow for a few days, and then he's got to go back out to Hollywood. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Jimster.  Hollywood.  But you can get a taste of Jim Norton tonight on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  Could you put it differently?  A little taste, a little taste.  I don't want a taste of Jim Norton.  Well, he's going to be doing his thing on Leno.  Has he now been elevated to just sit down and talking?  Just guest talking about his upcoming show, or is he, yeah, doing stand-up?  I would assume he's going to do both.  A little sit-down.  Unless his set is a little weak.  Remember, that was the big thing with Johnny Carson.  If your set was a little weak, you didn't get the invite to the couch. 
[01:52:00]  You got the little wave thing.  You talked to the old-school comedians, and they're like, that's when you knew you made  it, when Johnny invited you back to the couch.  You know how Jim is.  Jim is like, you know, when things are going good, he's like, he's a little arrogant, so  he might be, you know, doing a little skiddly wow.  Very comfortable with Jay.  Eat his little pink balls, and he says, like, the sound, you know, Leno, he's a jerk.  Then he'll go back to his place and kill himself.  That's the only way he could end with Jim Norton.  You know that, right?  Well, I hear Billy Burr is really popular in your spot on the radio. 
[01:52:30]  Listen, I heard that young Billy Burr, right?  People really like him, yeah.  Shut up, he stinks.  Hey, we got to say hi to Social Studies Steve real fast.  We were trying to get him on the air on Friday.  Steve, what's up?  What's going on?  He did an assault on the media, I think, Thursday or Friday.  Yeah, yeah, Thursday night.  In the subway.  Which one were you?  Were you the one jumping up and down with the blue shirt?  Yeah, that jumping fat idiot.  It was really funny, actually. 
[01:53:00]  And then after you did your thing, a black guy went by and started flashing his gang signs.  Oh, yeah.  Which made that a very fun assault on the media to check out.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, man, I was coming out of a John Mayer concert on Thursday night.  I know it's kind of gay, but whatever.  And then I saw the news van there, and I followed the court in, and I was kind of thinking of something to say.  And all I could come up with is the lame, you know, Opie and Anthony XM radio.  But, you know, I got it across, so.  Well, that's all we want.  We really want to promote the show in the end.  I mean, if you guys get creative and start, you know, use the signs and the T-shirts, that's cool as well. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  Or masks.  But in general, we want to get out Opie and Anthony and XM Satellite Radio.  Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for years.  I love you guys, so I just had to pay you back somehow.  That's cool, man.  You did a great job, but unfortunately, Paul's assault on the media on Friday beat you out, so he's in the lead for October.  Yeah, I kind of figured.  I saw that on Foundry.  Oh, well.  Like I said, you know, I wasn't doing it for the prizes.  I just wanted to promote the show.  Well, thanks, Steve.  Your video's up on opiananthony.com.  All right.  Have a good one.  All right.  There you go, Steve. 
[01:54:00]  What's up there, Anthony?  I'm signaling.  I'm signaling to the staff by waving money.  Patrice, would you like some food?  Oh, you know I ate already.  I would like some low-fat apple cake.  I don't understand either, Patrice.  It's so deliciously tasty.  This is the same guy that would go through a half a case of beer per show when we were on WNW.  Now he's ordering low-fat apple cake. 
[01:54:30]  I need low-fat apple cake.  We don't know how old he is.  You don't ask him.  You don't tell how old you are?  No, people seem to think I'm older because I met Groucho Marx.  And, like, in order to even have met Groucho, Groucho was born in, like, 1890.  Anthony has that seasoned oldness look.  See, it's like your, it's a tricky, like, mixture between drug abuse and old mobster.  He could be 28 or 50 and has that look about him.  Yeah, it's a weird thing. 
[01:55:00]  It's very strange.  You don't know, Anthony's age is not, you can't figure it out.  I always wonder how they want, Anthony, because we're hot.  I'd say about four, because you guys have been around, I'd say 47.  Wow.  Is that close?  Oh, because you know.  You know, I really do have to not wear my hat here some days.  All right, well.  Maybe I could shampoo at that morning.  Patrice, he's a vampire.  That's all we know.  You just live the long time.  We really don't know how old he is anymore. 
[01:55:30]  You've got a lot of life on your face, Andy.  Yes.  Boo.  All right, where's the prostitute story?  Where's the dog story?  Where's the clowns in prison story?  Well, you read that one, Patrice, because I didn't read this ahead of time.  This is just shocking.  Oh, yeah.  And we've got to get Ben in here, because he found a story in the Boston Herald today that's pretty funny.  This one, do you want me to start reading now?  This is shocking.  It just shocked me.  I don't know why.  But in Mexico City, half a dozen Mexican prostitutes have been arrested for using eye drops 
[01:56:00]  containing sleep-inducing drugs to knock out and rob their clients, leaving at least five men dead.  Oh.  That's what the newspaper says on Monday.  But here's a 139-year-old man who survived the ordeal and woke up giddy and missing his wallet  said he was careful not to let his drink get out of his sight,  but unwittingly ingested the drug after the prostitute put the drops on her nipples. 
[01:56:30]  So this prostitute was going old school where they put something in your drink.  They were first putting it in the drink.  But now everyone, the word's gotten out that you've got to watch out for that crap.  Watch your drinks.  Hey, you know, I don't drink, but put it on her nipples, which made me gasp.  That's the thing that made me, oh, my God.  So you start just teething, and before you know it, you're out, your wallet's gone, or you could be dead.  It's like I consider myself savvy with the prostitution, and that had not occurred to me. 
[01:57:00]  What a surprise, Anthony, another one of our comedian friends into the prostitution.  Not anymore, though.  Jesus Christ.  Not anymore.  Used to be.  Used to be.  Used to be.  Yeah.  But not anymore.  I've got a girl I'm kind of into now.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Well, you've got the sex swing, and you've got the Liberator that you brought home last week.  Thanks for the Liberator, fellas.  That was just fantastic, dude.  Basically, the sex couch.  You know those Liberators started out as just a little cheese wedge that you would see in the back of the magazines?  Yeah. 
[01:57:30]  Now they're getting really involved, man.  Absolutely.  It's a great product, man.  We had some of the best sex we ever had last night.  I'm a Liberator?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They need leather ones.  Liberator, make leather ones.  Leather?  Leather.  Just so you need to wipe them down.  Wipe them off.  It just comes in a squeegee.  Let me tell you something.  There's a sales guy named Will right now that is jerking off because you're talking about the Liberator like this.  He is jacking in his car as he listens to this.  What's his name?  Will.  Will Leather Liberator. 
[01:58:00]  You're talking to a real sex guy.  It'll be great.  The cushion is great.  It goes right back into place because I'm a big dude.  Yeah.  My girl's a little.  Snaps right back.  It was at least a combined weight of 487 pounds on that thing last night.  You did it last night on the Liberator?  Last night on the Liberator, Jack.  Nice.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  They prop up the girl nice on those things.  Oh, my goodness.  It was great.  You had a nice little angle, right?  Yeah, man. 
[01:58:30]  So I appreciate you guys hooking me up with that.  All right.  But this was shocking, dude.  This was like.  Yeah.  Because it was just like I've done a lot of bad things.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's like this.  I could have been knocked out big time.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I've done some stuff like that.  Yeah.  They could have put some drug.  Would such a small amount work?  Yes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And it's eye drops.  A little chloroform.  Yeah.  A little ether.  A little mixed.  A drop or two will do you? 
[01:59:00]  It's eye drops that are used as a muscle relaxant in eye examinations to dilate the pupil.  That's the stuff they're using.  And I guess it knocks you out.  I wonder if it has a taste, though.  At least you'd be like, well, you know, damn, bitch, your nipples taste salty.  You got some tired-tasting nipples, bitch.  There you go.  And I hope he doesn't get into it.  I hope he never partook in a film.  I swear to you, never did the prostitute thing. 
[01:59:30]  Not once.  I never have either.  Not once.  Never.  I have never.  I swear to you, I swear on my family.  Patrice, we've been a lot on the show over the last ten years.  You would think there'd be one story out there where we would be talking about a prostitute.  Never.  Never went to a prostitute.  No.  Not even close.  Swung?  Never swung?  They always scared the shit out of me.  It's a psychological.  Not just the diseases.  Not just the diseases.  Like, I think right when I was becoming the age where I might have done that or should have been doing that, 
[02:00:00]  that movie, Fort Apache, The Bronx came out.  What, what, what, what, what, what's her name?  What the hell was her name?  Foxy Brown.  Yeah, yeah.  Shit.  What's Jackie Brown?  Oh, Pamela.  Yeah, Pam Greer.  Slice that dude.  Pam Greer.  There you go.  And she had the razor in her mouth, and she put the guy up against the wall and was like,  she's all fucked up, and she's going, yeah, I'm going to suck your dick, and she kind  of nuzzles the guy's neck and just, whoosh, whoosh, slit his throat, and I was like, wow. 
[02:00:30]  I remember when you broke up with your girl a while ago, man, we was trying to get you  to go.  Yeah, they were even trying to get me to go down to Rio, right?  Yeah, man.  No.  Wow.  No desire.  What's your vice, man?  Huh?  You have any vices or what?  Yeah, rollerblading.  You're just really a nice guy, huh, Opie?  I'm not a nice guy.  Well, yeah, I guess I'm a nice guy.  A little wine.  A little wine.  Is that your vice?  A little marshmallows every once in a while.  Occasional Vicodin.  A little Javalog. 
[02:01:00]  No, you know what it is?  I've explained this, because the strip clubs is the same thing with me.  It's a little weird with the lap dances and stuff.  I need to feel like the girl...  Likes you.  Exactly.  That's why Brazil is a great place to go.  Exactly.  The GFE experience is fantastic.  So with the whole prostitute thing, it's like, I know the girl is just, you know, trying  to get money out of me, and psychologically, that does nothing for me.  I need the girl to...  What about your real girl? 
[02:01:30]  There's nothing psychological that she's...  No, she wants me.  That's the difference.  Well, she wants you if you...  Okay, not saying she's with you because you're opie, opie, opie, opie, opie, not with you  because you're opie, but saying that, you know, women, nothing's free.  Nothing is free.  But to see the girls, the prostitutes, they have no, like, attraction to you whatsoever.  They do, your money.  Yeah, exactly, and that's what...  That's the problem I have.  It's the same...  You got too many... 
[02:02:00]  She's not...  She's too many ethics, man.  It's not even that.  It's not...  I didn't go there because it was never a turn on to me.  Now, you live in a nice place.  I'm not even trying to live in...  I'm not trying to say that I got, you know, complete morals or anything like that.  It was just something I wasn't into because I just knew they weren't into it on a physical  attraction level or whatever, what have you.  I understand what you're saying.  And then, like, I like going to strip clubs, but I don't like the lap dances.  I'm like, as soon as the song's over, the girl that's looking like she really wants 
[02:02:30]  you, she's moving on to the next guy.  It's like, ah, gee.  Like, if it's impersonal, you want it to stay impersonal.  Don't pretend that you like me.  I hate the pretending bullshit.  But that's what Brazil is...  I'll go there, drink beers, and enjoy the eye candy without a doubt.  But when it comes to the lap dances, and I know the girl's just, like, so not into it,  but for a song she's going to make believe you're the hottest thing she's ever seen.  But you provide, man.  That's what we do.  We provide.  But I can't be bothered by that.  I can't be bothered.  That's all.  I understand.  Yeah, these guys are trying to get me to go down to Rio, and I was like, nah. 
[02:03:00]  Don't go down, mate.  One of these days we'll go, man.  Just to...  You know what I mean?  Can we?  Just so you can...  I understand, because I don't like it either.  I don't like that feeling like you...  You don't have to buy...  You don't have to buy it.  We don't have to buy it.  It's just...  It's not about buying it.  It's about...  No, right.  Out there, it's...  Dude, I understand why it works.  I'm just saying, for me, that's the thing I can't get past.  They treat you like they're really in love with you.  They do, and it's like, you go, thank you. 
[02:03:30]  Wait, but is there a part you go, and they're still doing this just because, you know, this  is what they do for a living?  No.  No, it's just because the way they do it is they go into your whole primal thing of being  a provider.  You give them a couple of bucks, and they just don't do that business thing.  They just become your girl as long as you need them to be.  They need your money.  You need them to be in your space at the time.  Yeah.  And it's like, don't you sometimes, even the girl you love, like, my girl, she's good  people, but I just don't want to see her. 
[02:04:00]  And it's like, don't sometimes you wish you could just go, hey, listen, sweetie, take a  couple hundred and get out of my life for a second.  Come back when I need...  Like, don't you wish your money could just buy your emotional needs when you need them?  Sometimes, because your girl won't leave.  Can't you just go to another room for a little while?  That's not what they do.  You mean get out of my life?  Can you go to another room?  Wow, you're not really in love then, dude.  I'm in love!  I'm nowhere near that with my girl.  No, there's no...  I want her around all the time right now. 
[02:04:30]  It's not like...  Maybe it'll change.  I don't know.  Right now, I...  I love my girl, but she's sick as...  Like, it's...  Her conversation stinks.  She's a girl!  How can you not...  How can you, like, be in love with a girl like that?  Do you ever say anything that's made you laugh, honestly?  I laugh at her, and she's not...  But that's when she's not...  Your relationship's doomed.  But then I'm at her.  No, man!  We've been together, like, almost four years.  Wow.  So she's been with me for two years.  I've been wearing for, like, four months. 
[02:05:00]  You're going to be booking a trip to Rio by January.  That's not true, man!  I'm so late.  She says something...  Does she ever say something she thinks is funny?  When she tries to be funny, it's useless.  When she does funny things, and I laugh at her, she gets mad, but it's hilarious because  she's being funny when she's being something else.  Right.  When she's not being funny.  When she's not trying to be funny, it's hysterical.  When she tries to tell me a story, like, when she...  Okay, like, you heard the guy that just called in?  Yeah.  When he... 
[02:05:30]  I'm...  It's interesting when people go...  Like, the guy, the English guy that is leading...  Paul, yeah.  Paul.  Hey, website, go to...  You go, all right, man.  You know, well...  But the other guy was kind of like, yeah, I did it.  You know, it's kind of...  When she's like that...  When she's being like Paul, she's awful.  When she thinks she's being funny...  Uh-huh.  But when she's being, like, kind of like, huh, I heard this thing last night.  It's like, oh, when she's being not funny, she's as funny as possible.  But I can't talk to her for more than 30 seconds at a time.  Yeah.  Really?  You know, you guys probably Eskimo kiss your girls, don't you? 
[02:06:00]  There's a little...  I'll be Eskimo kiss.  A little snuggling.  Fellas, you got to stop that, man.  If there was a reality show going on in my apartment right now, no one would listen to  the show anymore.  Yeah, you're a monogamy guy, though, but that's nothing wrong with that.  You're not wrong with that.  You're a monogamous guy.  You're an in-love type of dude, man.  They completely, you know, think him out of my mind when they listen to the show.  If there were cameras rolling at my apartment, people would be like, holy shit.  So your girl's funny.  Yeah, she makes me laugh, without a doubt. 
[02:06:30]  And I'm not laughing at her.  Well, I laugh at her sometimes, but she also makes me laugh, yeah.  Like, she goes, listen to this open, and it's like, she says something, and you're like,  oh, girl, we call you, oh, baby, you, whoo!  She's funny, and her whole family's funny.  She just comes from a funny family.  Fair enough.  You got lucky.  I'm, you know, the real answer would be the cool guy here, like, yeah, whatever.  No, I banged prostitutes and stuff, but the reality is... 
[02:07:00]  Jesus, see, look at this little underhanded little...  Cool guy.  Who was that?  Being, bringing prostitutes, look, before I met her, before I got with her, we've been,  it's just been a process for four years.  Right.  Okay, and I, like, because she saw, I still had a few women floating around, and she had  got to the point where women do, where they love you faster than you love them.  You know what I mean?  They just end to you quicker than you're into them.  So she looked on a text mail, and I had a text message from somebody.  We didn't really go together.  She says, I can't take this no more. 
[02:07:30]  I don't want to be with you.  And I said, really, let's be honest, we're really not together.  So, all right, I'll say this.  We'll be together now.  And it's been great.  Once I decided, like, okay, I'm going to have a girlfriend.  She's good people, man.  I love her, but I have to teach her how to be my friend, because she's a girl.  Yeah.  They don't know how to be our friends.  Come on.  That's rough.  That's a little rough.  You didn't have to teach your woman how to be your friend, how to be your girlfriend.  Not be a girlfriend, be yours. 
[02:08:00]  But be a friend besides your girlfriend.  Yes, teach her how to be a damn dude.  That kind of just comes over time, though, you know?  And time and, like, and mental abuse.  Knock her down a little bit.  Knock her down a little bit.  Build her back up until you're a girlfriend.  No, because I'm sure, you know, some of the stuff that you're used to doing isn't so fun for her.  Yeah, but a happy man usually means a happy woman, and not vice versa.  A happy woman a lot of times means an unhappy man. 
[02:08:30]  All right, well, speaking of love, we've got a love story for everybody.  Speaking of love, I saw this in the paper Saturday, New York Post.  I guarantee no one in America has a better story in their local paper than this right here.  Just say, wait, it's what it's funny.  Well, you know, we, you know.  A lot of people are commenting on instant feedback.  Very curious.  What does your girlfriend call you, Opie or Greg? 
[02:09:00]  I never noticed when we're out.  Opie Poo.  Because usually there's Sweetie or something like that.  Oh, there's a pet name that I will just go to your grave with.  Gropey.  Is it one of the normal Sweetie?  Baby?  It's, uh...  Honey?  It's bad.  Yeah.  Darling?  And I bet you my little was before it.  My little something?  My little...  And then a noise.  My little plup plup.  She calls me Greg.  Yeah?  Greg?  Yeah, but, yeah. 
[02:09:30]  It's weird because I hate, I hate Opie and I hate my real name, so it's...  What's wrong with Greg?  It's alright.  It's never liked my real name.  It's a good enough name.  Alright, so pound for doggy style sex sicko is the headline of this fine news story in the Post that it hit on Saturday.  A New Jersey man charged with sodomizing a Rottweiler named Precious...  Precious?  ...was jailed yesterday for violating a court order to stay away from the dog and her owner.  There was a court order.  That's what he was arrested for. 
[02:10:00]  Right.  Violating a court order.  Court order.  Stay away from the Rottweiler.  He refused.  Sodomizing.  I guess he sodomized the Rottweiler in the past and he was coming back for more?  I don't know.  Is it like...  I'm kind of bummed because I don't have the full story here.  I got a shortened version because they gave a lot more details.  They gave a lot more details in the article that I forgot at home.  I'm sure they didn't give important details.  Like sodomizing the Rottweiler.  Is that doing it in the ass?  Or it's a female Rottweiler. 
[02:10:30]  Is it doing it normal?  But since it's a dog, it's sodomy.  There's no way you could say having sex with...  Is it always sodomy?  Yeah.  What is sodomy there, Patrice?  Sodomy is the booty.  It is the booty, right?  It's the butcher.  I thought it was just some kind of an act that was beyond, you know...  No, that sadomasochism is what you're thinking about.  No, I thought sodomy was some type of...  Sodomy is booty.  Is it always booty?  Sodomizing someone is the booty.  The booty.  All right.  Jose Rodriguez was ordered to spend 40 days... 
[02:11:00]  45 days at the Middlesex County Jail by blah, blah, blah, whatever.  The judge said Rodriguez, 39, of Perth Amboy, violated a restraining order September 29th  when Maritza Rosario found him on her back porch at 12.30 in the morning, early morning there,  standing next to Precious, a six-year-old female.  Well, she's in her house, the dog's outside on the porch, 12.30, she hears a little ruckus  coming from the porch. 
[02:11:30]  Some kind of thing going on.  She opens up the back door and she sees this guy just standing next to Precious, a six-year-old  female.  Yeah.  But how can that be abuse if it's a Rottweiler?  A full-grown Rottweiler can go, look, let me tell you something, I'm not swinging that  way.  If I'm not enjoying this, I'm turning around and biting you.  It was a Rottweiler.  It wasn't a poodle or, you know, it wasn't muffin cakes, it was a goddamn cat dog.  Is it muffin cakes?  The little name?  No?  No.  It's brutal.  Maybe Patrice hit it. 
[02:12:00]  It's brutal.  Rodriguez faces trial October 20th on animal cruelty charges brought by the New Jersey Society  for the Prevention of Cruelty for Animals.  He was accused in January of sodomizing the dog last year.  I really like this dog.  So, he was, yeah, he would, they found him, yeah.  Here's the problem.  Go ahead, Dan.  Here's the problem I have.  Animal cruelty charges.  Now, don't think I'm sick, Gare.  I'm not condoning this.  Oh, boy, here we go.  But I am, I don't think this is animal cruelty. 
[02:12:30]  I think if you've got to come up with a charge, have, you know, sick fuck in the first degree  or something.  Like, you see, if you're screwing a dog, you're sick.  I don't think it goes to, animal cruelty is, you know, you crack a dog over the head with  a bat, you light, you light the cat's tail on fire and run off, you bury it up to its  neck and run it over the lawnmower.  Those kind of things.  Animal cruelty.  I don't think having sex with a dog is cruel to the animal.  I don't think they care.  And I'm an animal, like, I'm not an activist, I'm not actively trying to, but I really have 
[02:13:00]  a soft spot for animals.  Who doesn't?  And I don't look at, if I catch some, on the internet, I catch a little bestiality, I don't  look at the animal like, poor, poor thing.  So if I don't look at it like, oh, what are they doing to that dog?  Then it's really not, I don't think it's cruelty.  I don't think sex with an animal is cruelty.  I don't either.  Unless it's a chicken.  I've seen the German chicken ones, where the guy is just too big, and the chicken's  going, and the guy's going, oh, yeah, yeah, it's our chicken, yeah. 
[02:13:30]  This Aryan sick motherfucker is just banging a chicken, because you know damn well, the  chicken, there's not much room in a chicken.  So that's...  Oh, yeah, yeah, ah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, scoot, yeah.  I'm laughing extra hard, because this, Anthony and I saw this video together, back when we 
[02:14:00]  were working together in Boston, when the internet was like, the internet was the internet, you  saw it all, because they had, they had no rules, like Anthony always described, all free.  Anthony described the early days of the internet like the wild, wild west, it was all up for  grabs, man, and you know, legislation, they couldn't work fast enough to try to figure this  shit out.  You click around, you find yourself in a saloon, there's a gunfight, and broads, and this  stuff was just everywhere, and we saw, yeah, a German video with the guy doing exactly what  Ed's doing, as he's having sex with the chicken, holding the chicken in front of him. 
[02:14:30]  Doesn't he break the chicken's neck as he's having an orgasm or two?  I don't think it was that clip, because that clip just looked like he really enjoyed the  chicken.  Yes, they say that if you're fucking a chicken, right when you come, you've got to break the  chicken's neck and it starts convulsing and tightens up and really gives you a good one.  So, yeah, obviously that's cruelty.  You've never read the book Chicken Fucking for Dummies?  Like, oh shit.  Chicken fucker.  It's all there for you, Patrice. 
[02:15:00]  God damn.  Eat it when you're done.  So, we did see that, and I guess the videos I've seen over the years, the look that the  animal gives is just a look of curiosity, really.  Right, yeah, right.  It's anything.  You know, you could get the same look if you whistle to a dog.  It's a look of, what the?  Usually, Beastie Alley videos I watch is usually a dog and a girl, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never seen one.  And that doesn't look cruel at all.  That's what I'm going on with.  The dog is having a great time.  The dog is having a great time, and, you know, it has a tiny little, you know, little lipstick 
[02:15:30]  thing happening.  The dog's licking things.  There's no harm going on.  Jumping around.  That's why I disagree with your theory, by the way.  If it's a female dog, you know, humans are a lot bigger than the dog peepees there.  Well, a Roddy is a pretty big dog.  I think you could do some serious damage.  Well, maybe dog penises are average size.  You know what I mean?  Maybe they go, oh, wow, this is average.  I like it.  But the human size is like, ooh.  Like the Roddy is like, ooh.  Are you thinking?  I never had you.  I've seen dogs on the bestiality videos, some Rottweilers having sex with girls, and their 
[02:16:00]  penises were comparable in size to a human, let's say.  All right.  I don't see how this guy was herding the dog to where it's animal cruelty.  Okay.  Especially a Rottweiler.  Yeah.  Especially a Roddy.  Yeah.  If he's there with a Yorkshire Terrier in one hand, you know, holding like a jerk-off sleeve,  then I could see some animal cruelty.  Because the Roddy just went, that's when you know, she went, oh, yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, you see those teeth?  Turns its head around.  Oh, boy.  Then there's a problem.  I live in an area of New York.  They have these dogs walking around.  They all have attitudes.  I would be so happy if a pervert moved into the neighborhood and started, you know, messing  up.  What dog fucker moved into?  Without a doubt.  There are dogs that walk around in my neighborhood that deserve it.  Deserve a good fucking?  Absolutely. 
[02:17:00]  Absolutely.  Can you imagine?  They know they have rich owners, these dogs up there.  They give you a look like, you know, who are you?  Get out of my way.  Why wouldn't anyone tell me a registered dog fucker had moved in next door when I...  And they're breeding these dogs to look, like, cuter and cuter, but stop.  Cuter.  The dog was so cute.  What's your name?  I want to enact Fido's Law.  We don't need... 
[02:17:30]  It's always a goddamn name of some fucking kid.  The damn dog that got raped.  Little Fido's Law.  Fluffy's Law.  Fluffy's Law.  Spot's Law.  Absolutely.  All right, we'll get into the...  I guess we'll get...  There's a Rover Alert out today.  Have you seen this dog?  With a known dog fucker.  You see him in surveillance video with some Chewys. 
[02:18:00]  Lord him into his vehicle with some kibble.  All right, I'm blowing off...  I'm seeing with a heart's flea collar.  I'm blowing off all the phone calls because they're explaining what sodomy is.  That's funny.  You were blowing off the sodomy calls.  I found that...  Some people say sodomy is also sex with an animal.  Just sex with an animal in general.  I thought it was any, like...  What's the word?  Like a sick sex act is sodomy.  Anything that isn't just normal sex. 
[02:18:30]  A perversion.  Like ass sex.  We weren't getting...  Or even...  I think even oral is considered sodomy.  We weren't getting anything done because they all had a different definition for sodomy on the line.  Yeah.  So, we need an expert.  All right.  Ooh, sodomy expert.  Yeah.  Why not?  Hello, Mr. Opian Anthony.  This is Jonathan Griffith.  We got a New York City subway terror non-story.  This Fox News alert just in.  Sodomy is ass sex. 
[02:19:00]  We have an expert coming up to the desk now.  I have an expert for everything.  Got this subway terror thing, though, man.  I'm getting phone calls from all over the country.  Are you safe?  Don't take the subway.  I heard...  You heard nothing.  Shut up.  Everyone's in a panic in Manhattan now.  They're not dumb enough.  The Arabs are not dumb enough to do that.  I was at a pottery barn and the people were losing their minds.  They're not dumb enough to do it.  And this is why I hate the fucking media because they're still working the story hard.  Okay. 
[02:19:30]  They're not dumb enough to do it.  And if you do know exactly what's going to happen, tell us.  Stop with this.  We have a credible threat.  Well, what is it?  Apparently, it was just a couple of guys in Iraq that had information that you could get  on the internet with a map of New York.  I told you.  They wanted apple pie.  Is that it?  You think they offer them nice, luscious apple pie?  They wanted dessert.  They saw the guards eating some nice apple pie and dessert and they said, hey, I got some  info for you. 
[02:20:00]  And they're like, really?  Yes.  It's going to cost you a piece of that apple pie.  A slice.  How does that just want a piece of pie?  I just want a pie.  A piece of your goddamn pie.  Because we're all fucking gullible.  That's all it would take.  If I was one of those prisoners, I'd be yapping and flapping.  New York City.  Subway.  What do you mean pie?  Well, here's your pie, sir.  And they sit there watching me that he eats it slow.  Right.  And they sit there with guns waiting for the information.  Right, right.  And he's just eating it.  Mmm.  All savoring every bite.  Very tasty. 
[02:20:30]  Mmm.  I need ice cream.  Yes.  You Americans are so weak.  Put ice cream.  Much strollers.  The subway car.  Bombs.  October 9th.  Put more ice cream.  Pie.  I need another dollop.  A good dollop.  A dollop.  And that's what they think of us, too.  They just think we're that dumb.  Yeah.  And look, we, you know, freak out.  Know how stupid we are?  They're still checking the strollers.  The tourists have gotten the word. 
[02:21:00]  We know, we're on to them, that they might do this with a stroller.  So they're already thinking of something else.  So stop fucking checking the strollers.  Yeah, so Muhammad Atta guy is going to be wheeling a stroller onto the subway.  We got him, sir.  We got him.  And the worst thing that happened was in England, the black dudes that messed it up.  So that means now it's not just Arabs.  Yeah, look out.  You know, now it's like everybody gets, come on, just stop.  We can't profile.  Let's see what this latest story is.  I'm hearing it's a non-story, which the news is great at. 
[02:21:30]  And that's why we love the assaults on the media.  They're useless.  Good morning, Kirsten.  Those with a subway ride as part of their morning commute should notice the same heightened security we've seen over the past few days.  Both the mayor and the police commissioners say there are no immediate plans to pull out the extra officers or cut down on the extra bag searches.  Days after the public was warned about a potential bomb threat to New York subways, the feds are still saying there are serious doubts about the credibility of that threat.  Even so, Mayor Bloomberg continues to maintain he did the right thing, beefing up security and patrols. 
[02:22:00]  Many riders we spoke to this morning seem to agree.  Remember, the feds are the guys who couldn't predict 9-11, so I think he's doing a great job.  It's not going to scare a whole lot of people away.  The subway's a good system.  You understand what I'm saying?  There's always police on the subways and the platforms, so I trust them.  And it seems many strap hangers were not scared off this weekend.  The MTA says the subways saw normal numbers for a holiday weekend.  Good. 
[02:22:30]  Good.  Thank goodness.  See, we win.  Because if you don't ride the subways, the terrorists win.  They win.  They win.  And you guys, you guys, look, it's too easy to do it if you want to do it.  There's nothing they can do to stop it.  So all you have to do if you're a terrorist is go get on a train past the protection white people zone.  Whichever zone that's over, whatever circle of protection of the white folks in Manhattan. 
[02:23:00]  Right.  So if you get on at 149th Street and ride it down, have a nice explosion.  Right.  That's it.  The Holland Tunnel.  Listen, they check buses.  I mean, they check the trucks after the toll.  They make you pay the toll first, then they check your car.  So all you got to do is just run somebody over and drive.  There's nothing they can do.  What's the little wooden gate going to do?  Nothing.  You just drive right through.  If they want to do it, they're going to do it.  That's why all these alerts and when they say they've got credible information, it never happens on those days. 
[02:23:30]  It happens on nice, sunny, fall mornings that you least expected it when you're going to work and a fucking plane smashes into a building out of nowhere.  That's how it happens.  It doesn't happen after a warning and we sit there and go, strollers, subway, October 9th, and on the 9th, a subway car blows up.  It doesn't happen like that.  Sorry.  Why do you think they wouldn't blow up?  Like, blowing up the bridges and tunnels is a smarter thing to do than blowing up. 
[02:24:00]  It's because it would stop New York.  Yeah.  It wouldn't exist.  New York wouldn't exist.  But they live in Jersey.  I live with all the halal meat dudes.  Yeah.  They just, they're not going to blow it up because they can't get back and forth to do the terrorist stuff.  We still have to travel here.  That's why they're not going to, they live here.  Wait, you know what I mean?  I need to take the subway.  I can't blow it up.  Every morning, 9 to 5.  I can't blow that up.  They're not going to blow up the train.  We're going to be just fine because we got the Doppler 2 million. 
[02:24:30]  Well, we're all safe.  As far as the weather goes, we've got to let Patrice on this latest thing.  Well, yeah.  I was reminded because they just showed the forecast for New York and I guess we're going to have rain through.  Lousy weather all week long.  For three or four days, maybe five days.  George Bush's fault.  You know the weather, the weather guys just showing that the news is a joke.  You know, now they're trying to outdo each other with their weather machines.  Iraq and Al-Qaeda is trying to take away our Doppler radar. 
[02:25:00]  And how are we supposed to know if we can go on American Picnic if it's going to rain?  I remember when this...  Fucking moron.  I remember when this first started.  Like one local news station, they came up with what's called the Doppler.  The Doppler.  Yeah, and then Channel 2 had the Doppler 2000.  Yeah, but I'll be honest.  The first time, I think it was the Today Show.  Maybe it was with Al Roker or something.  I saw the Doppler and I'm like, oh, wow. 
[02:25:30]  Let's go to our Doppler radar.  Oh, Doppler.  And I was like, okay.  So I started following that channel a little more closely.  Yeah.  And then every station got the Doppler.  Doppler.  So then what do you do?  So then you start naming a crazy thing.  They went to the Doppler 2000.  2000, sure.  Which was like, fuck, how are we going to beat that?  Well, then Channel 4 went to the Doppler 4000.  That's right.  Because they're Channel 4.  And then Channel 7 here, which is ABC, went to the Doppler 7000.  That's right.  Now, obviously, the Doppler 7000 is so much better than the Doppler 2000. 
[02:26:00]  Of course.  So now what did Channel 2 do?  Well, they can't do much because it's 2000.  It's 2000, right.  Wait.  Actually, I got the audio.  Oh, you did.  Of this?  Is that going to help you?  Yep.  Okay.  Here's what they finally did, and it pretty much ends the whole Doppler fight.  Or does it?  If you're watching Channel 2 weather team, you'll see StormTracker.  This goes a step beyond StormTracker.  You see us with Viper, and this actually takes us one step beyond Viper.  So StormTracker, Viper, live Doppler 2 million. 
[02:26:30]  We have you covered.  Live.  You just said it.  Live Doppler 2 million.  They actually have now the Doppler 2 million.  How do you beat that?  Now, how do you beat the Doppler?  You'll just look silly if you go 4 million.  They went from 7,000, which was like the top one here in New York, to 2 million.  They didn't even try to go like 10,000 or 14,000.  They went to 2 million.  Do you know how silly NBC would look if they went, well, we've got 4 million. 
[02:27:00]  Everyone would go, now you're just playing semantics.  By the way, we threw out an assignment in America, by the way.  Yep.  And so far, we haven't gotten many in yet.  But we want to know what they're calling your weather machine in your city or town.  Everyone uses Doppler.  But it's what you put before or after the Doppler that makes it important.  Yeah, we'll get into this in a second.  But we want actual audio of your news team talking about the weather machine and what it's called, okay?  Yep.  I got one more clip of the Doppler 2 million here in New York. 
[02:27:30]  Now entering the ring, 1 million watts, the most powerful radar on TV, and the CBS 2 weather team with the live Doppler 2 million forecast.  Introducing Craig Allen, Chip Billadelli, Andre Puente, Dave Price, and John Valerius.  Yeah.  What horrible news test.  That music is great.  Yeah.  That's the Doppler 2 million team intro. 
[02:28:00]  The weather team or the whole news team?  I think it was the whole news team, but focusing on the weather machine.  And now, the most important people ever on the face of the earth.  With a Doppler 2 million.  The local news is starting to sound more and more like, you know, an SNL skit every day.  That sounded like it could have been on SNL over the weekend.  Doppler 2 million. 
[02:28:30]  That's where I made my balls.  The Doppler 2 million.  They suck on my Dopplers.  Get on them Dopplers, baby.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can win now.  And awfulness.  It's going to effing rain.  Yeah.  So in front of me, I don't turn this song off, by the way, when it comes on in my car.  I will sit and sing with it. 
[02:29:00]  Rise it up.  It's not going to be.  Take my time, take my chance.  You feel like you could get things done.  I could get things done.  I could get things done in my life.  I'm running, and I'm unsure of myself right now.  But by the end of the song, I know I can win.  I'm going to start that exercise program.  Yeah.  Today, man.  Right.  I got the eye of the tiger.  Let's say hi to Bill in L.A.  Bill, what's up?  Yeah, they got a radar called MOAR in Oklahoma City. 
[02:29:30]  Mother of all radar.  Stop it.  You're lying.  No, I'm not lying.  You've got to be lying.  No, no, no, no.  I'm not lying.  The mother of all radar.  All right.  I don't know if that's true.  God, I love that music, man.  We have actual weather machine names from around America.  Oh, yeah.  We're building on this list.  But so far in Cleveland, they have the following.  WKYC.  Channel 3 has the triple Doppler. 
[02:30:00]  Triple Doppler.  Three of them.  But Channel 5 in Cleveland has Doppler 5000.  Piece of shit.  Dated piece of shit because we got two million.  Triple Doppler or Doppler 5000.  Who wins that battle?  Triple.  Why?  Because the triple is at least 2,000 each.  How do you know?  Because 2,000 was like what they started with, the Doppler 2000.  If they have the oldest shit ever, they at least got 6,000.  Whatever's.  All right.  And then Channel 19 in Cleveland has Storm Tracker Dual Doppler XL. 
[02:30:30]  Beats Triple Doppler, even though it's dual because it's XL.  XL's always better.  So which is the best one?  Storm Tracker Dual Doppler XL.  Beats Doppler 5000.  And Triple Doppler.  And Triple Doppler.  Yep.  So Channel 19's leading in Cleveland.  They win with the XL.  With their weather machine.  How about Minnesota?  Channel 11 has Sky Scan 11.  Isn't that a helicopter?  Sky Scan?  Sky Scan.  That's just some dude named Fred looking up at the sky. 
[02:31:00]  Well, let's go to the Sky Scan, eh?  What do you see, Fred?  Well, it's a little cold up here.  Let me tell you something, Margie.  All right.  And then Channel 5 in Minnesota has Sky Max 5.  Sky Max 5.  So is it Sky Scan 11 or Sky Max 5?  They're both losers.  Max is kind of a gay name, though.  Who wins that battle?  Sky Scan 11 or Sky Max 5?  Based on Max.  Yeah.  Name alone.  You like Sky Max?  Sky Max 5.  Yeah, it just has a better ring.  Sky Scan 11 is just too goofy. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, wait.  We continue with Minnesota.  We've got two more.  Then they have Live Storm Stalker 59.  Storm Stalker?  That's kind of scary.  I like that.  And finally, the last one in Minnesota.  First Alert Mega Doppler Radar.  Who wins that battle?  First Alert Mega Doppler.  Mega Doppler is...  Hold on.  That is pretty big.  I'm going to give you all four again.  You guys tell me what station is in the lead in Minnesota.  Sky Scan 11.  Sky Max 5. 
[02:32:00]  Live Storm Stalker 59.  And First Alert Mega Doppler Radar.  You've got to give me the background music.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Sky Max 5.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  WHO with the First Alert Mega Doppler Radar.  That's who I think wins.  Yeah, Mega Doppler.  Mega.  Mega Doppler Radar.  Mega Doppler Radar.  With background music.  Yeah, yeah.  The Radar.  Thank you.  Yes, here I am with the Mega Doppler Radar Outlook for today. 
[02:32:30]  Let's go to the Mega Doppler Outlook Radar screen.  Yeah, Mega Doppler Radar is bad news.  Yeah.  We go to Connecticut.  There's a big battle for the ultimate weather machine name in that fine state.  You've got Channel 8.  Sky Max Doppler.  Now they're ripping off Minnesota.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hoo-hoo.  Channel 3.  Early warning Doppler 3000.  I like that.  Yeah.  How about the Doppler 12,000 Storm Track?  12,000 Storm Track.  And track, they leave the K off. 
[02:33:00]  I like the next one.  That's a good one.  How about the Power Doppler?  Power Doppler wins.  Power.  But then there's the ultimate Doppler.  Nah, Power Doppler.  The ultimate Doppler sounds like something you get at Denny's.  Yeah.  I love the ultimate Doppler.  Ultimate Doppler.  Yeah.  It just sounds like, you know.  And put some onions on that, please.  So you like Power Doppler.  You like Power Doppler?  Ah, Power Doppler.  I got to go with Doppler 12,000 Storm Track.  What about early warning Doppler 3000?  No?  Nothing?  No.  That doesn't have a...  All right.  Power Doppler.  That doesn't make sense, early warning. 
[02:33:30]  Because it's just too hard consonants.  We really got to...  You guys got to tape your local weather and send in the clips.  We got to hear them actually, you know, saying this shit.  Power Doppler.  All right.  Let's move over to Columbus, Ohio.  They have the forewarned first Doppler 4.  Forewarn?  Forewarn.  Whoever came up with that at the meeting should have been fired.  Fired.  So fired.  People don't understand.  That's why power...  Because you can go pow dop.  Pow.  Pow dop.  Oh, that's good.  Cut Doppler down.  You know what I mean?  Pow dop.  10,000. 
[02:34:00]  You know what I mean?  You can just do things with that.  Yeah.  And CBS 10 has dual Doppler 10.  Boring.  And then they have a...  Another station has pinpoint Doppler.  Why would I want that?  God, they suck in Columbus.  I think dual Doppler gets it, though.  Yeah.  Dual Doppler 10.  Just out of process of elimination.  Yeah, dual Doppler.  All right.  What about...  Well, there's one in Montana.  Storm tracker weather with Doppler net.  Doppler net.  What the fuck is that?  Like the net thing, but...  All right.  Philly.  Philly.  We got storm tracker 6. 
[02:34:30]  Doppler 10,000.  Mega Doppler 3.  We got to go with Doppler 10,000.  Hold on.  We got a couple more.  Storm chaser 13 digital Doppler times 3.  X3.  X3.  If that's X3, it wins hands down.  Anything with X and a number.  I don't even care if you're talking about Doppler.  Airplanes, cars, anything with X and then a number.  Oh, my God.  I get my money and I get my money and a note back.  There is no apple cake.  Again? 
[02:35:00]  Uh-oh.  I'm outraged.  You ordered that like an hour ago.  How long ago did I order that?  How many did you go to?  I went to the one across the street, then I went to 53rd, and then I went all the way  to Rockefeller Center.  Oh, my God.  You went to Rockefeller Center?  No apple cake.  No apple cake.  So you said you wanted it and I looked.  Yeah.  And I was...  You know, I come in and a man, all he wants is a good wage and some apple cake.  And now I buy gum. 
[02:35:30]  I've got to get me some apple cake.  Russ, I buy gum.  I'm entitled.  Wait, is this Power of Five?  Is that one, too?  Well, yeah.  Then we got Power of Five Radar Network.  Power of Five.  I like that one.  That sounds a little religious.  Yeah, I got it.  You know?  So in this group, it's StormTracker 6, Doppler 10,000, Mega Doppler 3, StormChaser 13, Digital  Doppler...  X3.  ...or times...  Yeah, X3.  I like that one.  And then Power of Five Radar Network. 
[02:36:00]  I like Power of Five.  That really is like jerking yourself off.  We're the Power of Five Radar.  You know they got a song for it and everything.  We are not Doppler.  It's like...  And we ain't no Doppler.  Not your ordinary Doppler.  Because I bet you it's religious because Doppler does sound like something really sexual.  All that Dopplin.  Doppler.  Yeah.  Yeah, I Doppler.  But Power of Five Radar is like, you know, we're not going to even stoop that low. 
[02:36:30]  We said it last week.  One challenge will just go on and say, fuck the Doppler.  We have God.  God.  And it could be like an acronym for something.  And D could be Doppler.  Yeah.  So we have your something G-O Doppler.  You know?  And that would be, you know, we're going to look to God.  Here's the God forecast.  Right.  Why hasn't someone done that yet?  Why can't we think of a word that starts with G that would make sense in this bit? 
[02:37:00]  Not Doppler.  All right.  Raleigh, North Carolina.  Raleigh, North Carolina.  Checking in.  It's Joe.  He goes, okay.  In Raleigh, we have First Alert Doppler and Doppler 5,000 fucking boars around here.  Not happy with their Doppler name in North Carolina there.  We have a few more.  We've got to get the audio, though.  You guys have got to help us out and tape the local news for us.  We want to hear these guys spew this shit.  Dave, Texas, what's up?  What's up, man? 
[02:37:30]  Hey.  We've got the Viper Max 6000.  Viper Max 6000 sounds really cool.  That's big.  Viper is a great name for something.  For anything again.  When the radar detectors came out, they started with the Viper thing.  The Viper.  Made it very impressive, right?  All right.  Let's say hi to Tom from Redding.  Tom?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Big fan of the show.  Thanks.  Ours down here is the Ben's Mule Doppler.  It's not.  Ed in Kansas, what's up?  Hey, listen.  We've got high-definition Doppler radar. 
[02:38:00]  What the hell is that?  Yeah, KSNW in Wichita.  Believe me, I will get you the audio.  I will run audio this evening when they run the goddamn audio.  Aren't they all high-definition?  Yeah, please.  They're all, by the way, the same goddamn thing.  Yeah, you guys, this is an easy assignment for you guys.  Just tape your local news, and let's hear what they say.  I will.  And send it in.  I'll get you audio.  All right.  Thank you.  We want to hear these things.  It's much better if we hear the actual audio.  Adam, New Orleans, what's up? 
[02:38:30]  Hey, we have the Super Doppler 6000 down here, and we've got some other bullshit and pinpoint  things like that, but nobody's said Super so far.  Super.  That's a good one.  Super is right.  Is this true?  Joe from Orlando says they got the Dirk Doppler.  The Dirk Doppler.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah, we want to hear some audio, though, of the guys, because it is great with the  background music and how much drama they put into their weather forecasting when they 
[02:39:00]  bring the guy up.  It's his most important, like, 30 seconds in his day is when he's going to be up in front  of the camera with that little thing in his hand that he clicks around with.  Rob from Whack Bag.  Hey, Ant, I'll see your Doppler 2 million and raise you Doppler to infinity and beyond.  Ah, I'm all in, Doppler.  When I was younger, I had the pop and lock Doppler.  The pop and lock Doppler.  The pop and lock Doppler.  Some suggestions. 
[02:39:30]  Good old Doppler for God.  I don't think that would be good.  Good old Doppler.  Let's go to our good old Doppler.  And this guy, Global Outlook Doppler.  Oh, I like that.  Not bad, but it's got to be a little more localized.  I don't think Dopplers are very global.  Right.  For your outlook.  All right.  What is ROF on the screen right now?  Uh-oh.  Rough.  R-O-F.  Is that the weather?  Seismic monitor.  Region of fucking...  But stuff is happening all the time, right?  Well, yeah, there are about a thousand earthquakes a year. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, ridge of fire or rim of fire, they call that.  So, by the way, if you're a psychic, you should be able to predict an earthquake.  It's almost three a day.  Oh, oh, God, the science guy.  Bill Nye, the science guy.  With his bow tie.  K-2 in these places, that's the border or the boundary between these two enormous...  CNN is claiming that the planet is angry.  The Earth is built.  Yes.  And you're going to try not to get into God about this, but this is the sign of stuff that  gets into religion.  You've got to argue religion about this, because it's looking bad for Earth right now. 
[02:40:30]  But it's not that...  You know what it is, though?  It's not...  You can't look at this and think it's religion.  You can't look at this and think it's religious.  You've got to look back at when people wrote the shit in the Bible and stuff and think  they thought it was religion.  Right.  So they wrote it down like, oh, God did this.  Meanwhile, you'll learn later on, no, it's just this big ball of mess we live on just  kind of yawns every so often and scratches its back.  It's just trying to shake some fleas.  Yeah, shakes fleas like the wet dog.  Just trying to shake off some fleas right now.  I never knew how awesome the Earth was until I just was on a cruise ship just floating 
[02:41:00]  on the Earth, floating on water, and just going...  Like, first of all, you stand on the edge and you just want to jump in.  Yeah.  Because that's how powerful it is.  You just want to just die when you see the ocean.  Yeah.  You just go, let me just die, because this is too scary.  It's too big and I'm too small.  Yeah, and it's just like you just know the Earth can just kill you anytime it wants, man.  Do you know what a speck you are on that boat?  That huge casino fucking floating hotel standing up. 
[02:41:30]  It's as big as the Empire State Building.  And you are a speck that isn't even distinguishable.  You cannot see little tiny things.  When you're out there, you think it's...  A wave that would be the hugest, sickest tidal wave that would swallow that boat like nothing.  Easily.  Wouldn't even be a ripple.  Easily.  It's just like standing over the edge, at night, I had to just step back, close it,  curl up like a little baby, know that I'm nothing.  Because that's how the ocean makes you feel. 
[02:42:00]  What cruise line are you going?  Some goofy thing I did for like Comedy Central.  I think it was the old people one.  Not Carnival, but the one that old people go with their families.  Royal Caribbean?  Royal Caribbean, yeah.  That's the one I went on.  I love the Royal Caribbean.  It's creepy, dude.  You get it going on the balcony at night?  I just go out there, you hear something calling you in.  That's why you know those sirens when they say sirens.  It's just that something calls you to jump in the water.  When you see the little, like the white foam from the boat, and it's so like quiet. 
[02:42:30]  All you hear, because you don't even hear the engines of the boat anymore.  These things are amazing.  But you hear the actual ship going through the water.  So you hear like a hissing, whoosh, whoosh sound, and just nothingness.  It's creepy, man.  And it's totally dark.  You look out to the horizon, and you don't see anything.  Or like, yeah, hundreds or thousands of miles of just more water.  But it's just blackness of water.  You get freaked out in those situations where you just want to go back inside. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  To feel like that your life really is important.  And you'll go listen to that singer, Hack Up Titanic.  Just anything to make you feel human.  Like your life is important.  Let me just go, I just, let me just, let me just die now.  Don't ask me why, but the first cruise I took, you ever look out over that ocean with night vision goggles?  It's hysterical.  It is really creepy.  But just don't ask me why I had night vision goggles with me.  We got to ask, obviously.  See, the balconies are very dark at night, and people tend to have sex on them. 
[02:43:30]  And with the night vision, you could see people screwing on there.  See, this is fantastic.  Now we're getting somewhere.  I really appreciate how bad you make me feel, because I mess with prostitutes.  Yeah.  But the real creepy shit just came out.  Night vision, you are a covert pervert.  Covert pervert.  Covert person.  Covert person.  I just wanted, I brought it because I just wanted to see what the ocean at night, kind of, the look of it. 
[02:44:00]  You just said why you brought it.  But then you find, you realize, because I had never been on a cruise before.  You discovered all the uses.  I had no idea that the balconies were set up like they were.  You could see that.  I just brought it to sea at night, into the ocean.  And you can't just look.  You had to lean over, over the ocean with night vision goggles, and probably a clamp to hold  itself to the top of the ocean.  Big blade is a window washer. 
[02:44:30]  I'm repelling down the side of the ship.  And then he brought a swat, a whole swat kit.  It's like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, just to see some fucking dangling down.  He landed on somebody else's balcony and just took his little thing off and said, pardon  me, ma'am, and just walked through the room.  It was just an extra perk that having the night vision goggles with me.  I didn't go there going, I'm going to look at people or see what happens at night.  So you don't think God just has anything to do with this stuff?  No, I think it's all just, I think it's, you know, the chicken, egg, egg, chicken thing. 
[02:45:00]  It's one of those things where people think it's religion that's happening now, but the  fact of the matter is, this shit was happening back then, and they saw it as religion.  I think, yeah, the planet's a living organism.  The planet, this whole thing is alive.  Think an asteroid, think one of those big ones is going to hit us home in our lifetime?  It could just, something could screw up.  What if the sun just goes out?  That's what, why is it, why do we think that fucker's got to stay lit the whole time?  Oh, there's plenty of hydrogen fuel to burn for many years, and slowly it'll grow. 
[02:45:30]  It's like, how the hell do you know?  What if one day, poof, right, it just goes out tomorrow.  Why not?  Well, all our calculations say that.  Yeah, right.  Well, there you go, trying to be God, and he just, you know, if you think.  Well, we know that there's a lifespan of, at least, our son is middle-aged right now, and  it'll last for another 10 gazillion years, and then slowly grow, and then.  If you think your life means anything in the end, go to the Grand Canyon for a reality check. 
[02:46:00]  That's a good one, too, yeah.  For a fucking reality check.  Me and my brother, we hiked all the way down to the bottom and back, down to the river and  back.  And you go down, and you'll hear some of these experts on their mules with the people  that are on the mules with them, and they'll start explaining shit, and they'll say, you  see that part of the wall?  Now, you've got to remember, this thing drops down miles, right?  But they'll point out a piece that's maybe, I don't know, I don't know, maybe 20 feet thick,  and they'll basically say, yeah, that took about 100,000 years to erode. 
[02:46:30]  And then you look from that point all the way down, like, miles, going, we ain't shit  in the end.  You know, it takes about a year for them to start making documentaries about all the things  that's, like, well, New Orleans documentaries are coming out already, but the real good  tsunami ones, and the explanation of just what happened, like, the pressure, and then  the earth just moves, and everybody dies. 
[02:47:00]  They said that the earth stopped spinning for a second, it was so powerful.  Yeah, it kind of wobbled a little bit, yeah.  That creeps me.  It's like, you just go, how can, you just go, damn.  You know, you just sit there, and you just, how do you keep going when you know the earth  can just take it, you know, knock you out of here?  I was in a rainforest in Seattle, Washington.  Well, it's actually, you know, not Seattle, but in the woods there. 
[02:47:30]  The whole rainforest, and we were hiking around, right?  And you see trees that are as big as this room in thickness, all right?  So, what is that?  At least 20 feet across?  Yeah, 25.  You see trees, you can't even comprehend how long it took to get this big, right?  A little sapling.  Right, it started with, like, just a little seed somewhere, right?  And these things are massive.  They're saying some of these trees, I don't remember exactly, like, 400, 500 years old,  right?  And then you see these same trees in other parts of the forest that fell down, okay?  Right, right. 
[02:48:00]  And this is where you realize you're nothing in the grand scheme of things.  You see trees now that are growing out of these rotted trees that have been growing out  of the rotted trees for easily 100 years.  Yeah.  It's, I mean, and, you know, I'm just, like, learning that them fires, all the fires we worry  about, that's, like, that's nature's, nature does that.  Yeah, yeah.  We need fires right now.  We just need to burn up some of that.  Yeah, got to burn some of this away.  This has to go.  The first time someone told me that.  The lightning hits, it starts a fire.  It's got to go, got to burn.  The first time someone told me that Earth was a living organism, I laughed, like, shut 
[02:48:30]  up.  But you really start to pay more and more attention.  This is the...  It's the truth.  And in the Matrix...  This is the, if we were smoking pot, we'd be freaking out stories.  But in the Matrix, they said we're...  I'm going to go all paranoid.  In the Matrix, they said, what, we're the cancer of Earth or whatever?  Yeah.  We're just little cancer cells.  Yeah, we're like a virus.  We're trying to destroy Earth.  We're just a virus crawling around on this thing.  You know?  We're just like this living bug that's fucking everything up.  But you know something?  In the scheme of things, we're not doing shit. 
[02:49:00]  Like, people, we've got to save the planet.  But you humans, we're polluting the planet.  If we were gone for any real length of time, the Earth would just cover up any existence,  any evidence that we were ever here.  That's what I think about the Earth is fine.  Are we going to be dinosaurs?  Are people going to just find us, dig us up, and then go, you know, what?  This was...  Yeah, what was this?  Like a Taurus of Cermonius here.  This was a...  Well, worse, if there's just never anyone to ever dig us up.  It just goes on of just some vines covering shit. 
[02:49:30]  There's some armless brain creature that comes around us.  Somebody with white eyes that sees in the dark.  You see on the Discovery Channel recently that whole city that was in the Congo that they're discovering?  Did you see that one yet?  I don't know.  Maybe someone can help me out.  But they basically have seen this thing that is hundreds of miles of a city that has been completely grown over now.  Oh, this stuff we haven't seen or found or anything. 
[02:50:00]  They said deep in the Congo was a civilization that one day just stopped existing because I guess they expanded too much or whatever.  And they couldn't handle it.  I don't know exactly what happened.  You think we'll be gone?  Like New York City will just be gone and somebody will discover it?  Nothing left.  Well, the Congo...  Take a broom and go, whoa.  This ancient city, they're discovering like, you know, like roads and stuff.  And it's unbelievable because now the trees have pretty much taken back the forest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was so a part of it, so maybe someone could help me out on the phones. 
[02:50:30]  They'll find like the Empire State Building with the little...  You think of the little brush?  With the little brush.  Wait a minute.  Just like he'll be digging a little hole and just see the tip of the antenna from the Empire  State Building and go, I think I found something.  There may be something under here.  Jerry, come here.  His name's still Jerry.  Help me dig.  7,000 years from now, it's Jerry.  Jerry.  It's still a condom, Jerry.  It's not like a Sarnak or something.  It'll be Jerry.  Charles, Charles.  Come here.  I found something.  Not some weird futuristic name. 
[02:51:00]  Just Jerry in the year 7,000.  Jerry.  Albert, come here.  Albert in the year 7,000.  I'm from the future.  What's your name?  Pete.  Pete.  What year are you from?  12,006.  Pete?  Pete.  Your name is Pete.  Oh, I get it.  You took a name from our time so as to make us more comfortable. 
[02:51:30]  What's your real name?  Nah.  Nah.  Just Pete.  Pete.  How you doing?  Well, my name is Pete from the future.  Shit don't change.  It just doesn't.  You're absolutely right, Patrice.  12,000 fucking years from now, it's just going to be Pete and Bob and Ed.  I think his name is going to be Doppler, 7,000 X or whatever.  And they're still going to want to drink on the weekend.  And still no flying cars.  No flying car.  No Mylar suits.  Of course. 
[02:52:00]  That's why I want to live forever.  That's the only reason I want to live forever.  Just to see stuff.  Yeah.  Damn it.  Something different.  Just to see, you know, the Jetsons.  The change.  Damn.  Because it's still the same, you know, Greg, the cars look great and all, but that's the  same motherfucking thing we're in that the Henry Ford was pluttering around on back in  the early 1900s.  I mean, we can fly, so you know there's possibilities, you know, you won't be able to know.  Yeah, but how much has the plane changed since the Wright brothers took off? 
[02:52:30]  It's the same.  I think a lot, probably.  Yeah, but the principle, all the same.  Where's just the hovering thing?  What is the principle of nature, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where's still just the flying car?  Where's the hovering thing?  Where's the jet pack?  We were promised the jet pack.  We were promised the jet pack.  We were promised the jet pack of flying cars.  Pete, where is the jet pack?  Pete, when will the...  We still don't have that thing down.  I'm sorry, guys.  What?  The what?  The jet pack.  I think we do.  Why?  But we're not responsible enough to have the jet pack.  Or the flying car.  Can you imagine if all of a sudden a store opened up and you could get your jet pack tomorrow? 
[02:53:00]  People falling out of the sky on top of the...  Are we going to be prepared for jet packing?  Yeah.  Yeah, probably right.  And flying cars is another thing.  Some of this technology, I think you have to wait for everyone around you to catch up  to you.  You think we're ready for 16 lanes of traffic stacked up on top of each other like a show  in Star Wars?  They're ready, man.  But they're just waiting for us to develop more.  Yeah.  They're ready.  We stink.  Who's they?  If you had your own...  Uh-oh.  You're letting Patrice in on the secret.  That's what I wanted to say about they.  This is the thing of like the aliens, right, Opie? 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  The thing, I go like this.  This whole thing about aliens and that we know there's aliens, like the government.  Mm-hmm.  But the government's made up of people.  So you think there's people out there that see aliens and they just keep it to themselves.  They go, hey, we got a secret here.  Hey, I know there's aliens, but I got my shit together where I don't say there's aliens.  That's a great way to look at it.  You know what I mean?  You know why?  Because people think those people that know are constantly in brick windowless buildings.  What about when he's at a cookout with his family or something? 
[02:54:00]  Nigga, I saw...  That's when it would come out.  And they got brains and they got big eyes.  It's like, oh, these dudes are so...  Like the president knows there's aliens and they're keeping it secret from little old stupid us.  He's not picking up the phone when he's in his secured, like, office.  Got to use his swipe card to get into it and going, yes, there's aliens.  I see them.  They're here in the building.  But when he's bowling, sweetie, how was your day today?  Oh, I got to keep a secret, but dang, bitch, I got to tell you this one. 
[02:54:30]  Just make me a steak because I...  All right, don't tell nothing.  Don't say shit, sweetie.  Don't tell your dumb friends at work.  These niggas got big eyes and four feet.  Goddamn.  Absolutely.  I've been into alien talk for years, but I've never seen it that way.  Conspiracy might ask.  Like, there's no aliens.  We've never seen them.  They don't have them.  No.  Somebody would...  It's just too much for a human being to deal with.  Bunch of rats. 
[02:55:00]  It's all we are.  Everybody's cooler.  We love yapping.  We love yapping.  Right.  You want to be the guy that tells something new to someone.  And even if the guy, you know, he saw aliens, you know, what makes it funny in my stupid thinking is,  you know he still has to wait for a table at a restaurant.  You would think...  And they go, boy, if I just told this guy...  You would think you could pull out that card and they'd be like, yeah, that's great, but it's still a half hour wait.  I don't give a fuck.  But you don't understand.  I've seen the aliens.  I've seen the aliens. 
[02:55:30]  You think you hint like, I think I could get a table.  I drove all the way from Roswell to come to your place, Roswell, New Mexico.  Dude, you know, I think about that where people would special jobs on this planet and they still have to go through bullshit.  They still have to wait in traffic and wait for a cab and all that.  Remember Jim Norton was telling us that he lives in that apartment, that apartment complex with that brilliant physicist or whatever?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Was it a physicist?  Yeah, that Asian guy. 
[02:56:00]  Asian guy is brilliant, strength theory, all that.  Supposedly he's smarter than just about anyone out there.  Jimmy and I were walking home once and the guy was just kind of walking around Central Park and getting on one of those bike buggy things.  Into one of those little rickshaw bicycle things.  Yeah, and Jimmy's like, no one has a clue that that guy is one of the smartest guys on earth.  And he's just taking a rickshaw.  Yeah.  Just taking one because he could.  But we give ourselves way too much credit, like people credit for that. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  You know, if there was going to be asteroid to hit, that there's a bunch of people that's just so much cooler than us as the end of the world extinction event is getting ready to happen.  It's like, all right, get our thing together because we're going to save the earth.  It's like, oh, Lord, oh, we're going to die.  We watched the whole breakdown during the hurricane.  I mean, we watched a very small scale version of that.  You would think that when that many people need that much help, that the government has the planes and everyone's waiting to swoop up nameless people that know their mission to swoop in and help everyone. 
[02:57:00]  And everyone was like, is that your job, who, the mayor, the governor, who's, but then didn't you ask for the, we got it, it's here, but we just got to gather it up and go, it's got to go here, who, what, no one knew shit.  And that told me right then and there that there ain't no alien hidden in Roswell.  There ain't no secret plans.  There's no conspiracy that we didn't go to the moon. 
[02:57:30]  We went to the fucking moon.  I love the people that say, no, if you notice, there's a set.  And they're props.  And you think that many people are holding their tongue and, I was there when they filmed it.  It's fake.  It was all done.  It was actually done by Disney in a studio by the Cape.  And that's why they gave them the property to build Disney World on.  And why?  The only thing I believe, conspiracy-wise, theory, is that they hold medicine. 
[02:58:00]  They hold cures for diseases.  Oh.  For money purposes.  That's the only thing I go.  Now, how would that be a money-making thing if they hold it?  Well, because medicine is money.  Medicine is money.  So if you withhold, what if you, if you found a cure for the common cold, somebody would kill you.  Oh, because there's so many cold remedies.  Because their understand would go out of business.  Bear would go out of business.  Because there's, like, things that make zillions in this country.  Treating a disease is more profitable than curing.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  So conspiracy-wise, I think that there's just a lot of, there's a lot of cures that, you know, 
[02:58:30]  it's more money to keep you alive with cancer than actually getting rid of it.  Oh, my God.  Like, if there's a cure for cancer out there, but people getting treated for it spend so much money.  Yeah, but there's so many opportunities out there.  Why wouldn't you start up a company where you go, fuck y'all.  I got the cure for the common cold.  Well, that's where the FDA comes in.  That's where they go.  I'm going to put you all out of business.  That's where the government goes, oh, this is some bullshit.  But now I'm going to bite you with your own shit now.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead.  How about the guy or the guys that came up with it? 
[02:59:00]  I'm sure one of them got cancer.  You think he's going to sit there and go, well, God damn it, I'll keep my secret.  No, I can't get the cure because I don't fuck up our whole thing.  He just takes a swig of cancer juice.  He kills himself.  That's all he does.  He'll be running out going, there's a cure, motherfucker.  I just.  So they're all in on it.  What about the wife, then?  They would make him a loon.  Like, I think the government can make you a loon if they want to.  So it's all crazy people got the cure. 
[02:59:30]  Got the cure.  Oh, that nutty fool.  Because you say if he gets it, then they just drink the cancer juice and keep their secret.  Cancer juice.  Now, what about his daughter?  Why would you want to get rid of?  What about his daughter?  His daughter's husband gets it.  Then that's where it stops.  Their kids get it.  Now, someone's going to start running out and going, there's a cure for these motherfuckers.  Anthony, if they cured the common cold, how many people would go out of it?  Listen, like the oil.  Why do they keep oil around when we got cars now that we can plug in or we can use the sun? 
[03:00:00]  The second the oil actually did run out, you would see shit come out of the woodwork.  Not because we have it there waiting in the wings, because we've always been, the necessity has been the mother of invention thing.  We wait until we, just like individuals, us as a whole, we kind of wait until we really need the shit before we put 100% into making it.  Yeah, because we depend on each other.  We have oil.  Why bother with the hybrids really pushing them? 
[03:00:30]  Why bother with the solar and wind power?  Yeah, we put a few windmills here to show that we can kind of do this.  That's why all this stuff has to come in nice and slow.  But it's oil.  If the oil ran out tomorrow, you'd see some fucking Phineas J. Whoopi motherfucking scientist.  I figured out how to separate the hydrogen from fucking hair follicles.  There'd be a new power source.  We'd be pumped the next day.  You'd see some Arab selling you fucking some kind of fuel made out of hair tonic.  I just don't, I just think that Willie Nelson's got something going on. 
[03:01:00]  Willie Nelson's got something.  I'm telling you.  I need a trucker to call.  I saw it on 60 Minutes or 20, 20 or 48 hours.  Is it the French fry oil?  It's some kind of oil thing they made.  I've seen the French fry oil running in modified diesel engines.  These guys go around.  They modified a diesel engine to take oil.  Willie Nelson started a whole company, man.  Vegetable oil.  So now these guys, this guy, one guy drives around.  He'll go to like a Chinese restaurant where they dump their fat in the back and say,  Can I have your fat?  And then they take it, melt it down, put it in their car, and run it. 
[03:01:30]  Now, you don't think, right?  That we're, right now, we can just have a bunch of cars that run on vegetable oil.  And I'm sure vegetable oil smoke is not as dangerous as fossil fuel.  You know what I mean?  But it's like, people will go out of business, man.  So that's, I mean, that's, I think what the government does a lot, the only, like,  where I go, conspiracy theory type of thing is, you're like, I don't think they try to  really put things in black people's sodas to kill us for real. 
[03:02:00]  Because it's just too easy for other people to get a hold of it and die.  You know what I mean?  But I think that they keep you from, we don't get cures for certain diseases.  I mean, to keep the common cold around is just a lot of money.  Like, AIDS might have been a big mistake when they invented it.  Yeah.  Because that just ran, that's like the blob.  Some things are like the blob.  It just got away from you.  Here we go.  This is what Willie Nelson's up to.  All right.  I didn't want to speak because I don't have too much info on this. 
[03:02:30]  Dennis, go ahead.  Yeah.  Willie Nelson, he makes biodiesel.  And what they do is they make it out of crops like sugar beets.  They take the oil out of sugar beets and convert it into biodiesel.  You know, it's made from crops.  So it saves the American farmer and they make diesel out of it.  Yeah.  Supposedly it runs cleaner.  It's better lubricant.  You know, all those things.  And there's a bunch of you truckers out there actually filling up on this stuff.  Sure.  Willie Nelson's even got a truck stop. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  What's the truck stop?  Excuse me?  Where's that truck stop?  Because that's the one they featured on this new show.  It's somewhere in Texas.  I've never been there.  And you can fill up right there with Willie Nelson's.  You know what I'm saying?  They probably call him Willie Nelson's crazy old coop.  Yeah.  Why isn't that as big as it should be the biggest thing in the world right now?  Because oil is right there.  We should leave Iraq because of that.  Because oil is right there.  It's right here and it works great.  It's not right there.  Beets are right there, Anthony.  Not oil. 
[03:03:30]  Do you know how many beets you got to fucking grow?  Do you know how many beets to take up all the oil?  Beets are there.  To where we can say, fuck you to you and your oil.  We got beets.  I got beets, baby.  There'd be a beet growing in front of you right now.  There'd be beets.  So every fucking flat space in this country would have to have a beet growing on it to  fuel the amount of shit.  I got beets and potatoes.  Who needs your effing war?  Beets.  That's what I'm saying.  Do you understand how big a news that is? 
[03:04:00]  But it's just old crazy old.  Some truck driver calls in and crazy old coop Willie Nelson, who's investigated by IRS and  he smokes weed.  Whoa!  Crazy knucklehead.  Here's Jeremy.  He actually drives on Biodiesel.  Jeremy.  Hey, Onay.  What's going on, guys?  What up?  Hey, I've been running Biodiesel for about six months and I actually got to meet Willie.  The only difference is it smells like chicken.  The fuel itself smells like chicken, but it ups your fuel mileage and everything because 
[03:04:30]  we only get like 6.2 miles per gallon and you put bio in there and you get like 7.9  8.3.  And what's it made out of?  It's made out of soybean oil.  Look at that.  Soybean, huh?  Yeah.  Soybean.  A lot of sois.  But they're there.  Soybeans are there.  There are so many alternatives that are out there, but everything right now is running  on oil.  The economy would be affected too much. 
[03:05:00]  You can't just like, you know.  Why?  You can't just all of a sudden start pumping beef and soy into your gas tank.  Why?  Actually, you could.  Thank you, sir.  No, but I'm just saying too many families depend on the industry, the oil industry.  What, they heat their homes?  Heat it on beet juice, baby.  My house smells like chicken.  Fantastic.  Soybean and beet.  You can go to Walmart and buy a five-dallin bucket of vegetable oil, pour it in a diesel.  You know how many people would be unemployed if all of a sudden you just said, tomorrow 
[03:05:30]  we're going to stop using?  That's what I'm saying.  That's the only reason.  There you go.  So that's why when this new technology comes out, it has to be a slow build.  A really slow build.  That's the point that I was making about the medicine.  Detroit.  It's like too much money.  Can you imagine Detroit would shut down if all of a sudden you said, hey, we're not  using gas starting tomorrow.  No, they would still make cars, but they would just make beet juice cars.  Make beet juice cars.  Yeah, but you have to rebuild the factories or build new ones.  Right.  You've got to repool.  A lot of things have to change.  You have to repool everything.  You can't just start, you know, stop this one day and start the technology tomorrow. 
[03:06:00]  I don't care what this guy's saying.  Your fuel tank in your house, if you fill it up with miso soup, that motherfucker is  not going to heat your house.  And that's the problem.  You've got to think about, you know, how it's going to affect the economy.  But if we needed it tomorrow, if all the oil ran out tomorrow, you'd see how quick  everything would change.  Going back to your common cold thing.  How many people depend on the cold medicines for, you know, putting food on their life?  To not cure it.  To, right.  That's what I'm saying. 
[03:06:30]  To relieve it.  But it's like.  But I'm saying, but if you came out with the cure for the common cold, like you said,  all those other companies that depend on that now go out of business.  All those people that work for those companies are unemployed and it affects the economy.  It's, it's, we're far.  But I don't think the people at the top care about the employment, to be honest with you.  I don't think it does.  I think they just, these people don't care about employment.  I think they just care about their money.  I don't think oil men give a shit about like whether their people are working.  They lay off thousands a day. 
[03:07:00]  It's like Verizon just laid off 47,000 people.  Nice talking to you.  We don't need you no more.  Bye-bye.  Work for Sprint.  I understand that, but it continues.  It filters down, though.  Oh, man.  I just think, I don't know.  That shit happens all the time.  You're right.  But the industry as a whole is still intact.  You can't take the whole industry away.  I think we should get out of this whole oil thing.  We should look into beet juice, look into soybeans, miso soup.  Hold on now.  But look at now, look at the people.  Because China, we're going to get into the, China wants oil. 
[03:07:30]  Let the, they want oil bad enough.  They are the big problem.  They're starting to suck it up.  They want it bad enough to fight us for it.  And we need to start using beet juice and running off of this bio stuff so we can get out of the war game, man.  Get into another game because we're going to be in trouble behind this oil.  Beet juice for freedom.  Beet juice for freedom.  Al-Qaeda doesn't like beets.  We've got to beat Al-Qaeda with beets.  We've got to beat him.  We've beat him with beets. 
[03:08:00]  Jesus.  Mike in New Mexico.  Go ahead, Mike.  Hey, that biodiesel, it's not made out of beet juice.  It's made out of soybean oil.  All right.  So now we've got soybean oil.  We've got beets.  Sugar beets.  Soybean.  No.  Chicken grease.  It's not made out of sugar beets.  There is no oil in sugar beets.  So it's soybean?  Soybeans.  It's just soybeans.  All right.  It's made out of.  All right.  We've got one more trucker from Texas, Randall.  Randall.  Hey, man.  How you all doing?  All right.  What do you know about the biodiesel? 
[03:08:30]  Okay.  Well, I just left Carl's Corner here in Texas, and that's where Willie Nelson's truck stop is.  That was the one that was featured on whatever, 60 Minutes or whatever it was?  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  First of all, Willie Nelson did not create biodiesel.  Biodiesel has been around for two or three years.  Willie Nelson just found out about it last year, and he started speaking out about it.  Right now, you can buy biodiesel that's mixed with soybean oil. 
[03:09:00]  You can buy it with a 20% mix with your regular diesel.  Now, sir, can I ask you a question?  Why is this not, like, why isn't this humongous news?  Why doesn't everybody in the world, or everybody in this country at least, thinking about putting soybeans in their car because of all this nonsense going on?  Why is this not news?  Hey, check this out.  Diesel was invented to run off of peanut oil.  Diesel engines have been around for, good God, what, 40, 50 good years, you know, as if running off of diesel. 
[03:09:30]  But it was originally made, created to run off of peanut oil.  The biodiesel.  From George Washington Carver, with his goddamn peanuts.  See?  Him and that fucking peanuts.  See how we do?  See?  We said, we don't need your fucking oil.  We don't need your black peanut oil, boy.  That's George Washington Carver going, hey, your diesel engine will run on this.  I figured out how to get the oil out of a peanut.  Oh, good work there, pal.  What's a nigga got to do?  Right.  What has a nigga got to do to get his peanuts used up in this motherfucker? 
[03:10:00]  You know that's how he looked at it, too.  God damn!  Oh, great.  Well, when he was growing up, he was the hero of the black community, as far as my history books went.  The only black guy I ever knew of in history was George Washington Carver.  That was the only one they taught us.  Do you see how that stuff?  Well, when the white man discurses the peanut, then we'll acknowledge it.  That's when a white guy gets to, you know.  Nothing else.  But what does a nigga have to do?  What's a nigga got to do?  I can save you guys a lot of wars and a lot of hassles. 
[03:10:30]  I'll get you out of this bullshit.  The car can run on a peanut, you idiot, and I got it.  You lose the peanut, baby.  How about a future with no pollution?  I got it right here.  I know it's listening.  Shut up.  What is this who's saying this?  Crazy Negroes doing something with a peanut over there.  Oh, crazy old Negroes.  But why, why, Anthony? 
[03:11:00]  Why?  I love it.  Why, Opie?  Why?  Why, Opie?  I love it.  I don't know.  Why?  Hey, old George Bush, here's something else you guys might be interested in.  Y'all were talking about the Chinese wanting our oil and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a big problem.  I know that they were coming into the state of Colorado next year to start drilling for  their own oil and natural gas and bringing in their own equipment, bringing in their  own workers.  Oh, yeah?  This is, I'm telling you, the Chinese, in the end, China's going to be the real problem. 
[03:11:30]  But here's the thing that you, this is why I love racism.  Because in the end, the world, the white man's, white people are not going to let Chinese  people be the leaders of the world.  No.  It's not going to happen.  China will.  Oh, yeah, it has somebody to build a railroad track.  God damn it.  Yeah.  With their little heinie hats on, those pointy things.  I'll leave the chain, yes.  Give them opium again.  Stop that chink of days pay for napping on the job. 
[03:12:00]  Blazing saddle.  Guy collapses from the heat.  Stop that chink.  Right on.  Here's the problem with China, though, if I could sum it up quickly.  The same thing that happened with the Soviet Union.  China is moving into this, actually, last century.  They're finally moving into it.  They're using fuel.  They're modernizing.  Their urban centers are branching out to areas that used to just be rice paddies and little 
[03:12:30]  communities that were almost tribal for so many years.  The same thing that happened to the Soviet Union will eventually happen to them.  It's good because they make more money.  They become more powerful in the world.  It's bad because it's hard to keep their people under control when they're able to see what's  going on in the rest of the world. 
[03:13:00]  That's what happened with the Soviet Union.  When they could keep their people shut up, don't look at this, here's our TV, here's  our radio, here's our music, here's our clothing, this is what you wear, this is what you do.  The second technology caught up, satellites, they started getting broadcasts from outside  the Soviet Union and started thinking, hey, this ain't as bad as they're saying out there.  That's when it all turned on the Soviets.  But that depends on the people.  Right.  Because I don't know Chinese people that well.  But people are fucking people. 
[03:13:30]  But look at Iraq, man.  Iraqi people don't want democracy.  They just need a dictator.  They need somebody to be...  Was there any suicide, any insurgence when Saddam was in office?  Iron fist, this motherfucker.  That guy would rape your family, kill you.  There was none of that.  Democracy, and now it's like we're trying to make this a democratic.  State or whatever, and they're going insane.  Chinese people have been under control since the Ming Dynasty. 
[03:14:00]  For 10,000 years, they'll stay under control.  They don't have babies because they're told not to.  They're obedient.  But if you start letting in other cultures and ideas to these people, that's when they  start going to look crazy.  Saddam wouldn't even let that.  That's why those people are so...  Why they didn't freak out like the Soviet Union and want freedom and rise up against...  Because they were cut off.  There ain't no fucking...  You don't go to...  You don't get 120 fucking channels of TV in your rock hut in your fucking Flintstone house 
[03:14:30]  in Baghdad.  That thing's just a big hollowed out rock with a rock roof.  Watching some lady with her eyes covered up watching SNL.  Oh!  Oh!  Who's this, Andy Murphy?  He's been around for years, baby.  You run in a house in Baghdad, and the same fireplace and table goes past you 20 times.  Fucking rock house.  Let's go to Idaho.  Matt, the final word on biodiesel. 
[03:15:00]  Hey, what's up?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I'm a farmer and a truck driver, man.  It takes diesel to fuel the tractors to plant the shit.  It takes diesel on the tractors to tend the crops, and then it takes a shitload of energy  to manufacture it.  It's just basically the same thing as that corn liquor methanol.  It's an additive, and until fuel prices really get up there, and until they can manufacture  enough to run their own tractors, it really isn't all that effective.  Yeah, that's what they say about a lot of these alternative fuel sources.  It takes to make the alternative fuel source. 
[03:15:30]  They use fuel.  But that's more cuckoo.  That's more...  Is it more cuckoo?  That's more stuff going on, whoa, cuckoo.  He's crazy.  He's a nutty, nutty guy.  It doesn't...  It's just...  Well, the people that...  I'm with you with the whole job thing, and I'm with you...  I just believe...  I'm not saying it's right, but that's one reason why we don't push a lot of this stuff  forward fast.  Remember Ed Bigley Jr. driving his electric car?  Or until everybody realized that he had to plug it in somewhere to charge it, and where's  the power in the wall coming from? 
[03:16:00]  The power plant that's running turbines that runs on fuel, on oil.  Right.  So he's just kind of eliminating the refining process from the fuel to his car.  Right.  And just using electricity.  But it's everything in this world right now runs on oil.  That's just the way it is, and it ain't going to change.  We should break.  We're way late, and we got Francine here.  God, I wanted to bring up the typewriter issue.  All right, let's do it. 
[03:16:30]  Why is the W next to the Q?  I don't get it.  It's kind of...  It has to do with what we're talking about.  Yeah.  It's the fact that Patrice is talking about things and how things have to change over  time, but what happened to the powerful typewriter people?  Why didn't they stop the production of computers?  Because they...  Look at all the jobs that were lost to the people that worked at the typewriter factory.  But they didn't know, because typewriters...  The idea of keyboards are the same as a typewriter.  They didn't change the...  So this is just a futuristic, brought-from-Pete typewriter? 
[03:17:00]  It's just a big typewriter.  It's just a fancy old typewriter.  That's all it is.  So it didn't mess the typewriter people up.  It just...  It's the same concept.  You think the typewriter people all went to work at computer places?  Or you think the guy that used to fucking mold the L...  Do you think he's working on fucking processes now?  I mold the L.  I'm the L guy.  I was the goddamn...  But even that was a slow transition.  There was a time we were still using typewriters and computers. 
[03:17:30]  And computers.  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, there's stuff we could be doing now, but it just takes time.  Now you think there's any...  That's funny.  Now you think there's anybody out there going...  That's sitting there going, I lost everything.  Because there's effing computers.  Computer shit.  Who is the motherfucker?  People are losing jobs no matter what, but you just can't stop it in one day.  Whiteout.  Whiteout.  How bad did Whiteout take a hit?  Who uses fucking Whiteout anymore?  I think somebody has to still use Whiteout. 
[03:18:00]  I think people do.  Of course someone's got to use it.  But you think the truckloads of Whiteout are leaving the factory?  Keep them rolling.  We can't get enough of the shit in the store.  Or you think, like, Mr. Whiteout's on the phone.  Where?  All right, now I'll bring it by myself.  I got it.  I got a toolbox in the trunk.  There's one guy in a pickup truck now.  You guys are not getting in touch with the Monkeys guy?  Because he owns Whiteout.  He's the Whiteout guy, right?  You ask him how it's going.  Yeah, Mike Nesmith or something.  He's the Whiteout guy.  Ask him how the Whiteout's going.  Oh, fucking computers killed me. 
[03:18:30]  We got a break.  We have to break.  And we'll continue with Francine doing the news in just a bit.  Oh, Francine.  I broke my knee, man.  I broke my knee, man.  Knee, man.  Knee, man.  Man.  Man.  Man.  Man. 
[03:19:00]  I broke my knee, man.  Fuck.  Pull my hand there.  You mother.  Jim Norton returns tomorrow for the rest of the week. 
[03:19:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Patrice O'Neill sitting in for Jim Norton.  I've got my headphones over my new hat.  Wait, who am I sitting in for?  Bobby Kelly or Billy Burr or Jim Norton?  At this point, we don't even know.  Wow.  You're actually here.  You're actually down to filling in for Adam Farrar.  Is it Adam?  Oh, no, I'm filling in for Adam.  You're filling in for Adam.  Damn.  Patrice O'Neill has his HBO special.  It aired Friday, getting rave reviews.  Congratulations on that.  Thank you.  And Jim Norton's going to be on Jay Leno tonight. 
[03:20:00]  And Jim's is coming on in a couple of weeks.  October 21st, I believe.  Yeah, Norties.  There you have it.  In studio, we have Francine.  Oh, before we go to Francine, I guess Danny, very excited about the dump contest we started  on Friday?  From what I hear, he's more excited than anyone else about this contest.  That means he must have a really good one.  I guess.  Supposedly, we've got two guys that have already taken their pictures of their dumps that they're  very confident about.  I took a look all weekend.  Nothing snappable?  Nothing that I'm willing to bring to the contest yet, no. 
[03:20:30]  I had a nice embarrassing moment.  It's over at my mom's house over the weekend.  And she goes, oh, I was listening to your radio show yesterday, and I just instantly  went, oh.  Can I enter?  Because I knew exactly what she heard.  She goes, are you talking about crap or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, mom.  Why is it our moms always hear the worst part of this radio show?  Yeah, she doesn't hear anything.  Why not?  She doesn't hear me talking about my geopolitical views of China.  She hears me talking about fucking taking the biggest shit and snapping a picture of 
[03:21:00]  it.  For our stupid contest we're having amongst ourselves.  Ask the break mom hears.  My mom, last time we talked about the show, she heard the fart game.  Great.  Isn't it?  That's like the easiest thing you can do on radio is fart into a mic and laugh.  That's what we did.  Just went to tune in.  Yeah, you guys sound great.  You're talking about farting.  So Danny's got a picture in so far.  And who else?  Whoa, our own Eric.  Oh.  Yeah.  We're trying to figure out where we're going to put him on Founder yet, but they'll be 
[03:21:30]  up pretty soon.  Just pictures of dumps, right?  Wait, you can't put him up until we all have our dumps.  I guess we're all going to have to have one before we put him up because they're going  to have to be completely anonymous.  That's right.  And then we're going to have the listeners vote for the worst dump and then that person  will win.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  If you want in, Patrice, snap a shot and then send it in to us.  Send it in.  All right.  All right.  So we got that going on.  I guess it's going to be judged by the audience.  So whatever they deem good, I don't know if that amounts to size.  You're all a fucking nuts, man. 
[03:22:00]  That could be size.  It could just be like collateral damage to the toilet.  Like a mudslide.  Yeah.  The goldenness of pee.  Right.  How golden is your pee?  Why not?  The gold pee.  A fine saffron color.  I was debating.  I'm like, do I go for like Katrina aftermath or just one solid one that looks like, I said  it like a barbershop pole.  I'm looking for something like, I'm not even going to snap. 
[03:22:30]  With different things going on in there.  Like a Carvel.  I'm not even going to snap until it looks like the History Channel special on Pompeii.  I went, it just looks like your shit is frozen and scared.  There could be people in there just entombed for life.  All right.  That's it.  The Mount St. Helens.  Yeah.  The side of a mountain blew out and it landed in my toilet.  You know you look ridiculous with your new hat on.  Of course.  Francine brought gifts for everyone. 
[03:23:00]  Yes, for our one year anniversary here on the air, she brought gifts.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Thank you, Francine.  I love you guys.  Are you going to be at our Halloween party?  Yes, I am.  That's the real celebration.  Oh.  Are you deciding on a costume?  Uh, I don't know yet.  I'll be a police woman or something.  Well, the costume we're hoping has something to do with the show.  Well, I heard that too.  Yeah.  I'll be a, isn't there Keith the Cop?  Yeah.  Oh, you could go as Keith the Cop?  I'll go Francine the Cop. 
[03:23:30]  That would be good if you did a Keith the Cop kind of thing?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I have so many inside jokes I could throw out, but I won't say one.  Does anybody just know how hot this Francine is?  Francine is very hot, yeah.  Thank you.  She's a little Nubian princess.  Well, she is precious.  And she's almost smart.  Well, slow down.  She's not too smart?  Oh, Patrice.  Oh, that's cheap.  I just started an LSAT course, you guys.  LSAT?  LSAT.  Yep, for law school.  Law school?  Mm-hmm.  Now, you're going to go... 
[03:24:00]  To law school.  To law school.  Yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  She's dumb.  This is fantastic.  She's beyond dumb.  I am...  She's not even close to smart.  She says she's smart.  Yeah.  She actually said...  What did you say about the news and how...  How...  She comes in to do the news for us, but she usually stays up all night writing the news.  Because it's really hard to put stories together.  What?  Stories together that already exist?  That already exists?  But to make it into five sentences. 
[03:24:30]  It's real hard.  Oh, you...  You pre-see them.  You put them...  You make them more precise.  Oh, you want to hear her news, Patrice?  You're in for a treat.  Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, it's Francine with the news.  Oh, God bless the world.  We got the teletype or any of that stuff?  All right.  Here we go.  A Cambodian couple attacked their 12-year-old daughter in her sleep by biting off her thumbnails  and nipping at her nose so they can suck her blood. 
[03:25:00]  Cops in Kampong, Chiang Province are confused.  They believe it was part of a black magic routine intended to chase away evil spirits.  A local lawyer says, we have no idea what offense to charge them with.  How about stupidity?  Because you know what?  Silly goops.  Sucking blood is for freaks.  Goops?  Goops.  Oh, goops.  Okay.  I thought you said goops for a second, but... 
[03:25:30]  I'm in love.  Patrice is the most beautiful idiot I've ever seen.  She put periods where there was none.  And Cambodians.  Is that how you're going to deliver your summation of a trial, maybe, or closing arguments in that  same fashion?  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.  There was a crime.  As you can see, my client is innocent.  But I'm going to be really hot, though. 
[03:26:00]  And I'm going to get to her suits.  The stenographer is going to slap the shit out of her.  She's putting in periods.  What did she just say?  I don't know.  This bitch is dumb.  I quit.  She actually just fessed up to the fact that she's doing it as a fashion statement.  Because she can wear suits.  She can wear those smart outfits.  $400 an hour is what they get paid.  $400 an hour.  Yep.  Some righteous bucks.  You better have the Carmen Electra story. 
[03:26:30]  Do you have that one?  No.  I do have a diabetes story.  Oh, okay.  I don't understand why we have people come in here to do the news, and they don't even  do the news that everyone else is talking about.  No.  Like gas prices and earthquakes and hurricanes and Iraq.  War on terror.  War on terror and the baseball playoffs.  Whoa.  Yeah.  What happened?  Well, I haven't had fun.  She saw it had a lot of words in it.  She just went, whoa. 
[03:27:00]  Whoa.  Words.  That's what happened.  We forgot to tell you, she also does commentary after she does her stories.  All right.  Save the Carmen Electra for a little later when we got a little low on the action.  Prosecution adds some new evidence she didn't know about.  Whoa.  I object, Your Honor.  Why?  Judge.  It's a lot of words.  Whoa.  I object to these words.  All right.  Go ahead, Francie.  Next story about, I guess, diabetes.  Sure.  Yep.  Medical experts warned the average American lifespan could drop by as much as five years in the 
[03:27:30]  next few decades because of an alarming escalation of diabetes.  Many projections suggest we could be the first generation since the turn of the 20th century  to have a shorter lifespan than our parents.  Diabetes suffers.  I wouldn't worry.  With hurricanes, tsunamis, the AIDS, towel heads bombing up the whole world, and now earthquakes. 
[03:28:00]  I'd say death doesn't look so bad.  That's a commentary, Patrice.  Yeah.  Oh, look at the love in his eyes.  He loves them dumb.  He is swooning.  He loves them dumb.  I love this girl, man.  He is absolutely swooning.  I just got so much to teach, and she just needs so much to learn.  Do you like Patrice?  Do you like him fat?  Not really.  Not really.  Well, really, I'm not fat.  See, she's so dumb, I can convince her that I'm in shape. 
[03:28:30]  I went out with a chubby guy before.  You did?  How was it?  It was okay.  What did it?  But he had a girlfriend, so that was kind of interesting.  Patrice, what might be more against you than your weight is the fact that you are a black  man.  Oh, you only like white guys?  Yeah, I kind of, yeah.  Yeah, she's raised in a rich area of Connecticut.  Really?  Well, I was growing up in the Maronick for a while.  Yeah.  Have you ever been with a black guy?  Yes, I have, actually. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, I have.  Well.  Oh, she's tender.  What does the white guy do that the black guy doesn't do?  They go downtown all the time.  Are you kidding me?  Is that all I need to do?  That's it.  That is such an urban myth.  Are you joking?  Well, not according to Francine.  That's right.  And she wears short skirts at work because the boss gives her money.  Her old boss gives her money.  He gave me $40 last week for no reason.  Just came up to you and gave you $40. 
[03:29:30]  Yep.  And she wears these little short skirts around the office.  Oh.  I'm just looking at Patrice.  I love it.  It's like she just gave me an in because I just love, I love to kiss it.  Patrice will eat the coochie.  I will kiss it in a minute, pumpkin.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Here's my technique.  I take two thumbs.  Oh, God.  Wait a minute.  I take two thumbs and I slide the hood back.  Then I hold it.  After it slid back with the two thumbs, I hold it with my index finger.  Then I spread the bottom with the other left-hand thumb with the index and the thumb. 
[03:30:00]  I spread that, slide the hood back, and I just rapidly in a very, just one side to side,  very fast.  I don't move.  I don't move my head.  I just take that spot and that's the technique.  And it's ironclad, 99.9% effective.  Okay.  Wow.  No kissing, no moving my head, no finding another spot.  You find the spot.  Once I know you like that spot I'm on, I stay there.  It's all a rhythm thing and it's all a repetition thing, pumpkin. 
[03:30:30]  That's really good.  Oh, I'm going to make your dumb ass cum.  Oh, you're going to be smart after I finish.  Trace is thinking, girlfriend, what?  Then she'll be like, and Cambodians.  He's going to lick the stupid right out of you.  I'm going to lick the stupid right out of you.  They say, no, she's the greatest lawyer ever.  What do they do with the snake poison? 
[03:31:00]  I'm going to suck the dumb right out of you.  We've got to act quickly.  She's infected with dumbness.  Someone has to.  No problem.  I don't want this dumb to get to your brain.  We've got to cut two X's and take your finger and fold the hood back.  God.  All right, Francine.  Sorry about that.  Let's hear the next story.  Patrice's technique is like flipping open a Zippo.  All of a sudden I saw his hands in his description.  I'm like, that's a Zippo lighter. 
[03:31:30]  You do the same thing.  Love it.  Go ahead, Francine.  Fat chicks around the country, put down those Twinkies and get down to your local cocaine dealer.  Daily News reporter Heather Gilmore reported that in the shadow of heroin chick model Kate Moss cocaine scandal,  doctors for the first time have diagnosed women who they say are picking up a speed or coke habit in order to help starve themselves to maintain a frighteningly frail frame. 
[03:32:00]  Uh, I say good for you fat girls.  Finally, a diet that actually works.  Hmm.  Hey, very good.  Yeah.  Oh, so at the end, that's her thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's her trademark.  Oh, see, baby.  Here, let me teach you.  You got to read that as if you are saying it.  Like, you're reading it with the same inflection as the regular story. 
[03:32:30]  So it sounds like that's the story.  So at the end, they just go, let me tell you something, you fat bitches.  Stop.  Like, you got to do something to make you sound like that's your commentary, because I thought you were still reading the story.  Yeah.  Like, end quote, and then, you know, unload.  Well, this is what I think.  Yeah.  That was what I thought, though.  I think they should all go out and get coke.  All right.  Gee, a lot of people want to keep you dumb.  I want to build you up.  I want to build you up.  All right.  Go ahead.  Let's hit another story.  Girls in dire need of abortion take note of this. 
[03:33:00]  Daily News reporter Nancy Dillon writes that Psyatech, nicknamed the star pill for a hexagonal shape, is well known in poor migrant communities all over New York as a cheap and private way to end unwanted pregnancy.  She writes that an 800 milligram microgram dose of Psyatech, which is about four pills, has a 60 to 90 percent chance of effectively ending pregnancy if taken in the first seven weeks of intersection. 
[03:33:30]  Lori Kehoe.  Intersection?  You said intersection?  Yeah.  Okay.  Lori Kehoe, spokeswoman for the New York State Right to Life Expectancy, says, we need to tell women that this drug can possibly deform their children.  But Education Secretary Bill William Bennett said this. 
[03:34:00]  Bill William?  Uh, William.  Yeah.  What did he say?  He said, judging by the awful amount of crime in black communities, I'd say it's a darn good idea to powder this pill and put it all of the colonel's recipes, I can't say.  He did not say that.  Oh, my goodness.  So, what was your commentary?  That was my commentary.  Oh, of course it was.  Oh, very funny. 
[03:34:30]  You listen closely, you know where the real story ends.  You gotta listen closely, though.  Oh, my God.  She's genius in a weird way.  Of course.  She's an autistic news reader.  Holy jill.  See, we call her an idiot savant without that pesky savant.  What is a savant?  Oh, precious savant.  What other stories you got there?  We're running out of time.  Just tell me which ones and we'll pick one. 
[03:35:00]  I'll get an entertainment story for Madonna.  What about the entertainment story about Katie Holmes pregnant and looking pregnant in the New York Post today?  I have that also.  Isn't she the perfect sitcom black girl?  She's genius.  Like, she'd be perfect for that role.  I could definitely see that.  And she has unoffensive sides.  Yeah.  Like, she has, you know, white girl sides, so she can get on TV.  Yeah, she's not offensive.  She's not threatening in any way.  Thank you.  And she knows the capitals, by the way. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yes, I too.  Of all the states.  Of everyone.  That's autism.  That's autism.  Give her one.  New Hampshire.  Newfoundland.  Newfoundland.  Yep.  There you go.  Again, she hits it right on the head.  Isn't that amazing?  Like, how do you not read the news, but you know Newfoundland is the capital of New Hampshire?  That's amazing.  I did really good in social studies.  Did you really? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, give her another one, Patrice.  One more.  New York.  New York State.  That's a tough one.  That would be Manhattan.  Manhattan.  There you go, pumpkin.  And where else could the capital possibly be?  We're here.  Center of the world.  That's not fair.  You're being too easy on her, because you like her.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.  That's easy.  All right.  Canada.  Um, um.  What is the, take your time, what is the capital of the state of Canada? 
[03:36:30]  Well, I do know that they have a Vancouver Grizzlies as a basketball team.  So the, that's, so you're saying Vancouver or you're saying Grizzly?  I don't, I just say they have a basketball team.  Yeah, and I think the Grizzly is the capital of Canada.  It is the, um, yeah, the, uh, capital and the state of Canada.  And they have a flower on their flag.  Uh, what, Canada?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  It is a flower.  Yep.  They sing that.  Yeah, I can want you to describe intersection, by the way. 
[03:37:00]  In that last story, you were talking about intersection.  I believe that is when the sperm hits the egg.  It's called intersection.  They have an accident at the intersection.  Right, and then they, and then, like, one time I, I raced through the insemination, and  I hit a car, and it was, we was trying to figure out whose fault it was, if it was, did  he run the insemination, or did I run the insemination, you know?  Sometimes the insemination, it's like, ah, I'm all confused about this goddamn insemination. 
[03:37:30]  All right, let's, uh, let's get some, uh, entertainment news before we get Francine out of here.  Oh, where's our entertainment news, uh, music?  Ah, and now Francine with the entertainment news.  Francine.  A group of rabbis in Jerusalem have accused Madonna of sacrilege, and hinted at a divine punishment  as she proceeds with a plan to include a paean to a 16th century Jewish mystic on her new album. 
[03:38:00]  The rabbis claim there is a prohibition on Jewish law against using the holy name of our master,  the sage Isaac, for profit.  said, they said this is an inappropriate act, and one can feel pity at the punishment that  she receives from heaven.  I say to these rabbis, relax your nerves with some matzo balls and some Torah, because I seriously 
[03:38:30]  doubt Madonna gives two shits about your feelings.  Bravo.  You know what's great, is that, punk, and it seems, people think you're dumb.  But it's genius that she's actually has the state of mind to be racist.  She knows racial slurs.  Yeah, yeah.  Calm your nerves, you Jew idiots.  I agree.  Speaking of racism, I gotta quickly move along here, because we're running out of show.  Carmen Electra, that's the big story today, Francine. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  You wanna read that?  We even highlighted the good parts for you.  Carmen Electra apparently blurted out the N-word during ecstatic moments in the bedroom.  So acclaimed ex-NBA star Dennis Rodman, who has married to the Baywatch babe for eight days  in the late 1990s, in his memoir, I should be dead by now, due in November. 
[03:39:30]  Take it and go ahead.  Take it.  Electra allegedly screamed during their first run in Toronto Hotel.  I think you misread that.  Oh, really?  Because it's Dennis Rodman's, Dennis Rodman saying what she used to scream out in bed.  Oh!  That's what she used to say.  Okay, he said, take it.  Take it, the N-word.  Go ahead.  Take it. 
[03:40:00]  Right.  Say the N-word.  You're allowed.  Be proud.  I don't think she knows what the N-word is.  It's nugget.  What's the N-word?  It's nigger.  She even made that sound good.  Her little potty mouth.  It's nigger.  She even made that word.  Potty mouth, girl.  See, if white people said it like that, I wouldn't be so mad at you.  You're a nigger.  All right.  Thank you, Cronk.  You're so cute.  Here's some money. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, thank you.  Oh, precious.  Yeah, that's a big story today with Carmen Electra, so, yeah.  All right.  I think we're going to wrap up the show with a couple of what did we learn, Charles in Dallas.  Charles, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Grizzly is the capital of Canada, and happy birthday, Patrice.  Happy birthday, Patrice.  All right.  Say hi to Jack in Staten Island.  Jack.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned that I had intersection with my girl last night.  Oh, congratulations.  All right.  Thanks.  Good for you.  All right. 
[03:41:00]  Howie in New York.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell them, Fred.  I learned that I'm never going to break the law just in case Francine would become my lawyer.  Yeah, imagine that's your court-appointed attorney.  Josh in Oklahoma.  What did you do?  I learned that Patrice is going to have to suck Francine's cookie.  A long-ass time to suck the stupid out of her.  And I'm up for the challenge.  Wow.  The listener is real good today.  Prozac.  I learned with time and mental abuse, a girl will become your best friend. 
[03:41:30]  And I learned Patrice will lick the stupid dumbness out of Francine.  Francine, you did a great job today.  Absolutely.  I'm sorry we ran out of time.  You'll have to come back sooner than later, okay?  Can I plug?  I'm going to be at a comedy show.  Go ahead.  Mayor.  New York Comedy Club on Wednesday at 8 o'clock in New York.  Performing?  Yeah, she's trying to do a little comedy.  Are you really?  Yes.  Do a little stand-up.  Toot. 
[03:42:00]  Shh.  Toot.  Patrice.  Thanks for the plug.  I want to thank Patrice O'Neill for stopping in today.  Absolutely.  Great job.  Bang.  Great job.  You haven't been promoting anything?  Nah, I was supposed to be in Arizona at the improv, but they canceled me because the opening  act was black and it said too many black guys.  Son of a bitch.  All right.  The whole stage.  Norton returns tomorrow.  Bye, pumpkin.  Party is over.  Everybody go home.  This is Speak for Beak in the show. </pre>
