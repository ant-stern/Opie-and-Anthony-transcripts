<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, frequently employing vulgar and offensive language.  The show began with a discussion of crude jokes about gay men and female anatomy, transitioning into a review of their own infamous April Fool's Day pranks, including the Boston mayor prank that led to their firing, a fake Pearl Jam concert, and a Thanksgiving turkey hunt that resulted in a listener riot.  They also discussed other radio pranks and a Google April Fool's Day prank, interspersed with listener calls sharing their own prank stories. A caller mentioned a two-armed baseball pitcher, sparking further jokes. The segment concluded with an analysis of the film *Cobra*, focusing on its absurdity.

The show then shifted to further discussion of *Cobra*, with a frequent caller, Tommy, expressing his appreciation for the film. This segued into another listener's story about a baseball game featuring a two-armed pitcher and a switch-hitting batter.  Canadian comedian Guy Earl then called in to discuss his legal battle with the Human Rights Tribunal after insulting hecklers at an open mic night.  He detailed the lawsuit and expressed frustration with what he considered politically correct overreach.  The hosts supported him, discussing free speech implications. The conversation turned to 90s music (Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Oasis, Corrosion of Conformity), misheard lyrics, and a caller sharing upsetting news about a friend's death. The segment concluded with a Smashing Pumpkins song and preparation to prank a caller named Steve from Yellowstone.

The next segment started with a discussion about the Nissan Cube and the perceived prevalence of Hispanic drivers, followed by observations about a lack of English signage in some Asian neighborhoods.  Celebrity gossip writer Ian Halperin then called in, boasting about an A-list actress's wife performing oral sex on him and claiming the woman received a $10 million payoff from Tiger Woods. He discussed other Hollywood gossip, including rumors about Tiger Woods, Jesse James, Gerard Butler, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie.  A caller from "WhatWouldTylerDurtonDo.com" challenged Halperin's credibility, leading to a heated exchange.  Halperin also interacted with a caller who identified as a “Koh-Ain Jew” before abruptly ending the call.  The hosts then discussed Nick Cannon's April Fool's Day prank involving a fake Justin Bieber song, a humorous photo tweeted by @JimNorton, and the serial killer Rodney Alcala's appearance on "The Dating Game," including graphic details of his crimes and the many unidentified photographs found in his possession.

A highly vulgar and sexually explicit segment followed, filled with graphic descriptions of sexual acts and objects, a crude "hot dog cock" internet search discussion, and a game show segment where the winning contestant identified himself as a banana.  This transitioned back to Rodney Alcala and the "Dating Game," with a call from "Sarge" providing further details.  A call from Steve from Yellowstone led to extremely offensive and inappropriate language, followed by trivia questions and a bizarre phone call about "butt plugs" (mistaken for "spark plugs").  The show revisited the "Cocks in a Box" prank and its legal fallout, including a reading from a fictional "Book of Ted." Discussion then covered Newark's surprising month without a homicide, the upcoming iPad, personal technology preferences, and eye problems, all interspersed with further crude humor and personal anecdotes.  The segment concluded with detailed, vulgar planning for a repeat of the "Cocks in a Box" prank, including suggestions for provocative signage.

The final segment detailed a street prank involving a box labeled "Free Puppies" containing gay pornography. Opie, Anthony, Jimmy (in a hoodie), Danny (observing and relaying information), and Sam (operating the camera) executed the prank, observing the reactions of passersby.  The hosts made numerous offensive comments about the participants and their reactions, including a historical anecdote about President James Polk's bowel problems. Despite a mishap where Danny taped the box shut, several people opened it, prompting shocked reactions. The hosts analyzed the prank's success and discussed improvements for future attempts.

[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you. 
[00:07:30]  Thank you. 
[00:08:00]  Thank you. 
[00:08:30]  Thank you. 
[00:09:00]  Thank you. 
[00:09:30]  Thank you. 
[00:10:00]  What, today?  Yeah.  A few Stern Show people.  Oh, boy.  And Kenny.  And it's like the only place you hear something like, so George, you can't do living La Vida 
[00:10:30]  Homo?  And then he was like, I'm not sure I know the way the tune goes.  I'm not sure of that.  I'm just thinking, only in this fucking building do you see Sulu being asked that question and  answering, you know, La Vida Homo.  Living La Vida Homo.  I guess they're working on something over there.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It was pretty funny just standing in the elevator.  All I wanted to do is go, oh, boy. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, boy.  You really like those yellows, don't you, in that fucking commercial?  Of course he likes those yellows.  Of course he does.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my.  Yes.  Well, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, everybody.  Oh, look at that.  It's April Fool's Day.  This is the first April Fool's Day we've worked in a while.  Yeah.  Didn't we make a pact that we fucking don't work April Fool's Days?  Yeah.  April Fool's.  This is a tape.  We made it yesterday, and we're not really here. 
[00:11:30]  Not kidding, of course.  Why are we taking the tape?  We're really here.  I got my girlfriend so good last night.  It was like 1230.  Yeah.  Did you?  And she was brushing her teeth, and I just, I banged the, I banged the bedpost with my  hand, and I was like, oh, oh.  And she came in, and I told her, I think I smashed my knee, and I couldn't move my leg.  And she was like, well, just lay back.  Just lay back.  She was panicking.  No, you didn't.  I got her so good.  She gets all worried for you like that?  Oh, yeah.  It was, it was just, I just, I hit with my hand. 
[00:12:00]  It was like a thud.  I was like, oh, oh.  Oh.  And she just came in.  She was like, what's the matter?  I'm like, I banged my, I'm like, I twisted it.  Oh.  Yeah.  But then the ambulance and the paramedics came.  On the way to the hospital, I yelled, April Fools.  April Fools.  Everybody tugged my wiener.  Oh, you.  We're getting away from the April Fools thing for a second.  I just want to say, later on today, I'm going to have a diversity meeting at my house.  Yeah.  All different races and creeds.  That's your April Fools.  April Fools. 
[00:12:30]  Never happened.  They say April Fools, you open fire on them when they walk in and yell, April Fools.  April Fools.  Mother, you son of a cuckoo.  Well, you know that a big article came out today for all the radio stations out there warning  them about April Fools radio pranks.  And we're mentioned, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Don't do what these stupid idiots did.  But those idiots do.  I asked for a copy of that in front of me this morning.  And, well, why would I have it?  Why would I have a copy in front of me? 
[00:13:00]  We have it, Danny.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Talking about our mayor's prank.  And they added a little tidbit that.  And then in later years, Opie and Anthony admitted they did this to get fired so they  could work at any W.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We let that info slip out seven years later.  I was, uh, I was, I had some, it is odd.  It's April Fools.  And we did get fired for that mayor thing. 
[00:13:30]  What year was that?  98.  98.  98.  April.  April 98.  12 years ago.  And he's still the mayor.  I know.  It's insane.  And he was the mayor for a few years before we got up there.  Boffiston.  And so I was kind of thinking about that as I was trying to go to sleep.  But the thing is, I slept from noon till 730 last night.  Well, see, that's a problem.  I did like the big sleep there and got up and then I'm up.  So then I tried to go to sleep later on and just couldn't do it. 
[00:14:00]  So, of course not.  But, but I had put on a music channel of some like classic alternative shit.  So it was pretty much shit we used to play at AAF.  Oh, so like lithium?  And yeah, yeah.  So I'm like, I'm like listening to it and some songs pop up and it's like, holy shit.  I fucking remember vividly what we were doing, been in those motherfuckers and just sitting  there talking about what we were going to talk about for three minutes and then have  to play more music when we first got there and smudging girls IDs to make them look legal 
[00:14:30]  before they got naked.  Yes.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Yeah.  Fucking.  Foolish danger ahead for radio.  What?  I guess this is, oh, Tom Taylor, right. 
[00:15:00]  He's one of those guys in radio.  He's kind of big.  Tom Taylor writes a column.  April Fool's Day is tomorrow.  Plan wisely.  This came out yesterday to a lot of people.  Yes, this is TRI's annual plea to morning shows, programmers and other station personnel  to think twice, three times about how a potential April 1st stunt might play out.  Successful ones leave everybody feeling good.  No, they don't work at all.  The successful ones. 
[00:15:30]  Because everyone knows they stink.  Bad ones leave local cops unhappy and some citizens aggravated, writing the FCC about  the hoax rule.  Yes, there is a hoax rule.  Radio's got an egg on its face many times for half-baked ideas that sounded great in the  studio, but which had disastrous consequences out in the real world.  TRI reader Jay Philpott sends along a link to the global top ten list at the Museum of 
[00:16:00]  Hoaxes.  And radio figures in two of them.  Yeah, we made the Museum of Hoaxes.  Are you kidding?  We made the top ten list of the Museum of Hoaxes.  Fucking A.  In the Museum of Hoaxes.  I didn't know we were on that list.  Radio figures in two of them.  Among radio's less glorious moments.  Less glorious?  I thought it was completely glorious.  Can we see the top ten list of...  Thanks, Stan.  Among radio's less glorious moments was the 1998 episode in Boston where the WAF personalities, 
[00:16:30]  Opie and Anthony, kept doing a bit about Mayor Tom Menino being killed in a car crash.  In such ridiculous fashion, no one should have believed it, but we've been through that  before.  Many times.  They persisted, even after the mayor's office called and said the hoax was upsetting his  family.  ONA later suggested they were trying to get fired so they could take a job at WNAW in  New York.  It was successful.  Well, that was our big fuck you to Bruce Mittman. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Because Bruce Mittman slid the paper over to us at the dumb Chinese fucking restaurant.  It was lunchtime and it was buffet time, so it was a cheap fucking lunch for him because  he was taking us out to lunch.  Yeah.  Slid the paper over.  Anthony looked at the new figure that he wanted us to work for and Anthony openly laughed  at the guy.  Literally started cracking up laughing at his offer.  So we had to take the offer because we had no agent or no real pull at the time. 
[00:17:30]  But I told that, we'll get him in the end.  And that's what we did.  And it was like right after we signed.  So we were stuck in a contract.  And then right after we signed, we get a call from a fucking N.E.W. from Infinity.  Yeah.  And it's like...  No, not just...  We got a call from N.E.W. and K-Rock.  Yeah, yeah.  Steve Kingston at K-Rock.  And who called us at N.E.W.?  I guess...  Gary Wall.  Was it Gary at the time?  Gary Wall.  Oh, fuck.  So we met with them and then we're like, oh my God, we got to get out of this deal. 
[00:18:00]  Well, Gary goes to me, he goes, it's too bad you guys are under contract.  We'd hire you tomorrow.  And we're from New York.  They're like, hold on.  We'll be right back.  Don't do anything.  We'll be right back.  So I go to Ed, I'll take care of this.  We'll come up with something.  Let's get this job done quickly.  So, all right.  Upsetting his family, O.N.A. later suggested.  Yeah, okay.  That worked, but the mayor stayed mad for years.  Yes, he certainly did. 
[00:18:30]  But he's cranky anyway.  And then a Norfolk station once did the famous eruption of Mount Trashmore.  See?  I mean...  Mount Trashmore!  See, that's just...  What?  That's hacked.  Ours is believable.  But this show did a bit where it's an eruption of Mount Trashmore, a real park built on a  trash dump that earned an admonishment from the FCC.  So basically, they were saying this mountain was going to erupt.  Why?  And what did that do? 
[00:19:00]  Why would they...  It gets everyone scared and freaked out, I guess.  Management acted quickly to contain the damage, but it's better to avoid it.  So, plan wisely if you plan to be April Fooling.  Doesn't Radio Chess suck?  It's fucking terrible.  I know we're part of it, technically.  It's fucking terrible.  They have to actually put out a warning like that?  Put in nerds.  Some stations will fire people for shit like that.  But as far as FCC goes, I think you're okay unless your hoax takes emergency personnel 
[00:19:30]  away from anything they would normally be doing to have to react to your shenanigans.  Right.  Then you're in trouble.  Which ours didn't.  No, ours didn't.  They alluded to the...  Yeah, they tried to make it like...  They tried to get us on the hoax rule, but basically what happened with us, the mayor  just demanded we get fired or he would make life miserable for the radio station and all  the other radio stations that was owned by the same company.  That's the only reason we got fired.  We didn't break any... 
[00:20:00]  Once again, we didn't break any FCC regulations or nothing.  No.  They were trying to hang us out by using the hoax rule, but it didn't apply here many years  ago, 12 years ago.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, let's say hi to Kevin in Syracuse.  Kevin.  Hey, Google's real funny.  It's Topeka on their homepage today.  I was shocked that you guys warned me.  I just told Ant that it said Topeka.  Yeah.  But I don't get what that means.  Am I missing something obvious?  Yeah, why would you just do that?  Well, if it's not in Kansas, learn more about our new name. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, let me click on it.  Anyway.  That doesn't...  That's stupid.  It's not clever.  Google's a huge...  See, that's why they need us to come up with April Fool's pranks.  Topeka.  We'll get people talking.  Why would you just have it say Topeka instead of Google today?  What's it say?  Who cares?  Learn about our new name.  So they think it's going to be named Topeka.  It's because Topeka last month announced that they were changing their name to Google.  So that's the big April Fool's joke. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Hey, the Museum of Hoax.  Anything good in there?  Where is the Museum of Hoax?  We probably got to go to, like, radio hoaxes or something.  I'm sure we wouldn't make...  They have the top 100 April Fool's pranks of all times.  April Fool's pranks.  Okay.  Ah, whatever.  I hope that...  Oh, God.  What's his...  I'm tired.  What's his name?  Aw.  The Martian fucking radio show. 
[00:21:30]  What a great one that was.  Oh, oh.  Orson Welles.  Orson Welles.  Oh, Orson Welles, yeah.  Well, that was a really good one.  Yeah.  You know, people...  It wasn't April Fool's, but...  Yeah, because people were stupid.  Committing suicide.  They were just stupid.  Ah!  Running through the streets screaming, thinking aliens were actually...  Yeah.  Unfortunately, no one talks about our April Fool's prank we pulled the year before the one we  got fired.  The Pearl Jam show.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We said it was a free Pearl Jam show.  That was monstrous, but then we do the Mayor's Prank, and they forgot about all our other pranks. 
[00:22:00]  We were doing a solid April Fool's prank every year, and then we finally did the Mayor's  Prank.  On the top.  And that was...  I think that's the last one we did on radio.  Yeah.  I don't think we've done one in 12 years, Anthony.  No.  And for the most part...  I mean, they weren't even joking.  When they hired us in New York, they said, you're not working April Fool's ever.  We might have slipped one in there somehow.  I don't even know.  And I think this is the first one in a while on satellite.  Yeah.  But the Pearl Jam one was great. 
[00:22:30]  We found a tiny little town on the border of...  It wasn't even real.  I can't remember the town's name anymore.  Did we make up the name?  Yeah.  We made up the club and the name and kept giving people directions that were close to that  tiny town.  Okay.  So we said it's like just east of this weird little town we found on the map.  But we never were...  We weren't specific enough.  So people were just driving around like idiots everywhere.  And the state troopers called our show.  This is the God's honest truth and said, please tell everyone this isn't happening.  Yeah.  They had to set up...  It's a zoo up here right now as people are trying to find out, find this place where 
[00:23:00]  Pearl Jam is playing this secret show.  They had to set up spots where the troopers would direct traffic because it was just a  huge traffic jam in the middle of the afternoon.  I've saved a lot of our stuff over the years.  That was fun.  I don't think I have that.  I don't think I have that show.  I would love to hear...  No, I would like to remember it as I remember it.  I probably wouldn't want to hear it.  You think it sounds hacky?  Yeah.  But the mayor's dead?  You haven't heard that?  No, not the mayor's dead. 
[00:23:30]  No, the mayor's dead.  The other one, the Pearl Jam Planet Club.  We played the mayor's prank many times over the years and it sounds hacky and it sounds  like who the fuck would ever buy into this and believe this.  Exactly.  And probably the Pearl Jam thing the same way.  I know you and I, after we got off the air, we're like, all right, we're heading to the  show.  And then we went into the production room and we found Pearl Jam songs, like regular studio  songs, and we played them and added crowd noise.  Yeah.  And tried to make it sound like it was a live song.  It's like, yeah, we're here. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  The club was called Larky's.  Larky's, right.  It was Larky's.  At this point, Pearl Jam didn't have any live music out yet, so we decided to find some  We just took studio recordings, kind of put some echo on it or just a little room on  it, you know, and added crowd noise.  You know, the most amazing part of the story is that you two went into the production room.  Yes.  We used to do a lot of production.  You know what?  If I had to find a production room here at SiriusXM. 
[00:24:30]  I wouldn't even know it.  I don't know.  I think it's a phone booth.  I think it's around this corner to the right, right?  Is that where it is?  I don't know which door, though.  I don't know which door.  It's D-Boys.  I know it's one of three doors.  I could narrow it down to one of three doors.  But yeah, them and I are yelling and screaming in the background, like, we're here, Pearl Jam!  We were doing live cut-ins to who was doing nights at that time.  It might have been Scorch.  Yeah, Scorch.  This might have been before Rocco.  Yeah, Scorch.  Like, we're here, screaming, this is unbelievable. 
[00:25:00]  I can't believe Pearl Jam's doing this.  It's a free show.  Believe it or not, there's still a little bit of room.  So if you get here, people are just, oh, there's still room.  At Larky's.  They couldn't figure it out.  Larky's.  Yeah, we got some nice press on that one.  Let's say hi to 44 Across in Pennsylvania.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  Orson Welles does War of the Worlds, and you guys say a guy who can't speak is dead, and 
[00:25:30]  that's number two?  Are you saying it's a bit of a drop-off, sir?  It's a little bit of a drop-off, and I'm really surprised by the hot air balloon that  you bombed.  Hey, yes.  What about the bra bombing?  You're right, boys.  All right, look, you know, we had to do some of that hacky shit to find our way, and we  found our way.  Yikes.  Believe me, I've had to tell myself a lot of things at three in the morning when I was 
[00:26:00]  awake, too.  That's a rational thing.  Staring at the ceiling.  Not a pretty sight.  Let's go to Drew in Oaktown.  Drew?  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hi, Drew.  I was going to suggest that maybe you consult the Talent Coach website to see what might be  deemed acceptable for your radio show.  Hey, what is Dummy doing?  Oh, man.  I'm in the office doing nothing.  Well, let's see what the Talent Coach is suggesting for an April Fool's prank today. 
[00:26:30]  That's not a bad idea.  Sam is usually the go-to guy when it comes to seeing what Mr. Mariah Carey is doing.  Coke Logic, a big Pearl Jam fan, I believe, right?  Yeah.  He's surprised.  He goes, I never heard about the fake Pearl Jam prank.  The problem was, right around the year, we got fired in 98, but right around the year,  I would say, 97, early 97, that's when fans started taping our show every day.  Yeah.  Before that, the tapes are so fucking- 
[00:27:00]  96, we were-  No one gave a shit.  No one knew us.  No one-  No one knew us.  We were building.  No one cared.  We were still building.  We played a lot of songs, and we didn't talk that much.  I would love some of those tapes.  Maybe there's one or two out there that were taping.  Yeah.  I doubt it.  I doubt it.  But right around 97, then people just started taping everything we did.  Yeah.  So, that's why we don't have that Pearl Jam stuff.  I know I don't have it, unfortunately.  I would love to play it just to hear how hacky it is.  It's out in the cosmos somewhere. 
[00:27:30]  I'm trying to think of other radio pranks.  We could have our listeners help us out.  There's always some really bad-  Bad, like-  Pranks.  Fucking hacky ones that they think are great.  One that a lot of radio stations do is attacks that's going into effect for pets.  Yeah, yeah.  The pet tax.  The pet tax is a big one.  You have a cat you're going to have to pay, and then they call up all outraged.  I knew this would happen.  Shut up.  And off the top of my head, like, all of a sudden, pennies are useless now. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So, people are outraged because they don't know what to do with their pennies anymore.  Or pennies are going to be useless at, like, 4 p.m.  Something like that.  So, you have to get them together and go to the bank now with all your pennies.  Yeah.  Oh, that sounds great, huh?  You have to eat your pennies like Zell at the end of The Marathon, man.  You shit them into the teller's hand.  Zell.  Zell.  What was the prank with the turkey hunt or some shit? 
[00:28:30]  I forgot the story.  That wasn't April Fool's.  That was Coke Lodge.  No, we realized that our listeners, I think that was the first time we realized that our  listeners were a bunch of fucking animals.  That was Thanksgiving.  For Thanksgiving, we went on the air.  Oh, my God.  Peter was so pissed.  Holy shit, they were pissed.  This was a pretty good one, too.  We said we want to go old school for Thanksgiving, and we were going to allow you to catch your  own turkey for Thanksgiving.  This was an original bit that I think other people took since. 
[00:29:00]  So then we would feel calls from people like, well, what could you bring to catch your turkey?  Could I bring a net?  And we're like, yeah, you could bring a net.  You just can't bring guns, we said.  Yeah, anything but guns.  And then people were like, well, can I bring a baseball bat?  Can I bring a lacrosse stick?  All this weird shit.  And we were like, sure.  And then Peter's calling and yelling and screaming, and they were threatening to protest, and  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And go ahead.  Yeah, some people, I think a few people were onto it, but played along, because they were  like, I got a two-by-four, and I put a railroad spike through it, and I want to come down there, 
[00:29:30]  and, you know, can I just crack the turkey with this thing?  And we're like, yeah, whatever it is, as long as it's not a gun, you can bring it down.  And people were calling up just outrage.  Completely outraged, but people getting more excited, because we're like, be creative with  how are you going to catch your turkey?  So they would come up with all these crazy things.  They were buying it, hook, line, and sinker.  And we had that huge rock bus.  It was literally a rock bus that you see, like, bands use when they, you know, go to  the concert venues. 
[00:30:00]  Tour bus.  The radio station had one of those, and you could broadcast live.  You put the stick up.  So we found a field in Framingham, was it?  Yeah.  A huge fucking field in Framingham.  I mean, it was huge.  And a couple hundred listeners showed up, which was pretty impressive for the time.  And all of a sudden, they're lined up outside the rock bus.  We're broadcasting live.  They got all their tools of destruction, like they're going after fucking Frankenstein.  We told them the turkeys are out there.  And then we said, the turkeys are out there.  Go get them.  And they start rolling like lunatics into this wide open field trying to find the turkeys. 
[00:30:30]  Some of these sick fucks had, like, weapons that were, like, medieval maces.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And then we're broadcasting live, and we're, like, talking about – I think we finally  gave away the joke to the listeners that were listening on the radio, but they were  in the field, and they couldn't hear the show.  And we're looking out the window of the rock bus, and they're slowly turning on us.  They're, like – they're looking around, like, what the fuck?  There's no fucking turkeys out here.  What the fuck? 
[00:31:00]  And then one person found, like, a paper turkey.  Like a centerpiece that you'd put on your table for Thanksgiving, those fold-out turkeys.  So the gag was there's no live turkeys, obviously, but we peppered the field with these paper  turkeys.  So if you bring back a paper turkey, then the radio station would do the right thing  and give you a free Thanksgiving dinner courtesy of whoever.  Yeah, it was like a big frozen butterball turkey you'd get or some shit like that.  So then we thought, okay –  We thought, all right, they get that we pranked them. 
[00:31:30]  By the way, that's a funny prank.  That's a fucking funny prank, man.  Yeah, honestly.  People, like – people were really, like, into crushing and killing fucking living animals.  But see, a funny one.  See, we – but we end up fucking them a little bit, but in the end they do get something  for it.  Yeah.  And as far as a radio bit goes, the audience is like, holy shit, you fucking assholes.  We loved when they used to call us, you fucking assholes.  But a lot of people didn't care.  They just wanted to kill something.  So then they started turning around, and they're like, holy shit, we've just been had.  And now we're like – it wasn't even us. 
[00:32:00]  I think it was Otto at the time.  Remember Otto?  Yeah, yeah.  Otto had explained to everyone, no, no, no.  If you get the paper turkeys, we can do the right thing, and we're going to give you  concert tickets, a butterball, this and that.  And they were just –  I don't think he got that far in his conversation with the crowd.  So all of a sudden they started – to make a long story short – they started attacking  the rock bus while we're live on the show.  Rocking the rock bus.  They wanted to knock it over.  And they're pelting it with rocks and snowballs and ice.  Yeah, big chunks of ice.  And we were talking to – what's his name for the first time? 
[00:32:30]  Durst.  Fred Durst.  Fred Durst.  Fred Durst was doing an interview in the rock bus as we were being pelted.  It's like, what the fuck is going on out there?  And they were – some of the windows were – they broke a couple of the windows, so  we actually had to like – we were broadcasting like sitting on the floor, and we couldn't  just get out of there because – I forgot.  The boom was up.  The boom was up like 20, 25 feet, so you couldn't just pull away.  The cops had to show up and break up the whole fucking thing.  It was a nightmare.  But great radio.  That was a fun one. 
[00:33:00]  But they turned on us like you wouldn't believe.  They didn't have an interest in us to the point where they go, oh, you fucking assholes.  Good one.  They were like, fuck you.  Who are these assholes?  We have to kill them.  I wanted to kill something.  You didn't allow me to bludgeon a turkey.  You know what assholes people are.  I know.  I know.  Morons.  Fucking just murderous people.  Yes, they wanted to kill something.  We wanted to injure something with a fat body and a little head.  Creeps.  Yeah, but we were hanging out with Limp Bizkit on the bus when all that went down.  That audio I would love to hear again, too. 
[00:33:30]  Because that was some real shit.  Because you could hear the rock bus being pelted as we're trying to do our show.  Just big bam, bam, bangs.  Yeah.  Let's go to Isaac in Georgia.  Isaac.  Yeah.  One of the stations here in town tried to pull off the format change old gag about three  years in a row.  Pretty terrible.  Isn't that the worst?  When you have a popular rock station, they go, we're going country. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And then everyone's outraged.  And then they can't even go with the bit.  They only play like one country song.  You got us.  April Fool's.  Because they get all nervous.  They can't even commit to it.  I know.  They should do like a six-month thing.  Right.  Or at least a day.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Let's go to Bill in Boston.  Bill.  Hey, good morning, Apple.  Oh, Bill.  Hey, the worst prank ever was when BCN, up here in Boston, they flipped formats to like 
[00:34:30]  jungle music.  And then they ended up going sports.  So like a few months later, it was horrific.  Yeah.  It was foreshadowing.  Yeah.  I'm still amazed they took BCN away from you guys.  That's just completely fucking ridiculous.  Hey, I got XM.  Fuck them.  Later, guys.  There you go.  That's what I like to hear.  Yeah.  That's what we like to hear.  Mark and Brian.  Are they still doing radio?  John in Washington.  John. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, lovers.  How you doing?  Hi, Jack.  Hi, Jack.  Yeah.  Hey, hi.  Good morning.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mark and Brian back in the day.  They were all excited.  We're like, you guys would turn the volume slowly down in there, which makes me sit in  here, turn my radio up.  He, he, he.  Then they come back with April Fool's.  Oh, it was great.  Oh, it was great.  We all just laughed and laughed and laughed.  Oh, yeah.  They were tickled.  They talked about it the next year that they weren't going to do it again and now whatever.  What a genuine pisser. 
[00:35:30]  I love this guy.  Oh, they were tickled.  They were tickled pink about them.  Tickled pink.  I have a funny prank.  I'm going to play later for April Fool's.  Thank you, John.  What are you going to do?  I'm going to threaten to fart and then not do it.  Oh, wow.  Let's go to Tim in Iowa.  If they're anything like yesterday, by the way, when I was leaving yesterday, I'm leaving  the garage.  Yeah.  They, you know, pull your truck up.  They pull my truck up.  Which is nice.  And yeah.  And Kenny will open the passenger side door and throw my bag in there. 
[00:36:00]  And I will go around to the driver's side and get in.  And Jimmy's like, oh, that's your vehicle.  That's your.  And I hear him saying that and go, he knows this is my truck.  So right when I get in to the driver's side and shut the door, I look over.  My passenger door's open.  His ass is in my truck.  And he's now waving.  He's wafting.  His latest fart.  What just came out of his ass.  And if you remember yesterday's show, Jimmy had the worst farts ever.  And he filled my fucking cab up. 
[00:36:30]  Did you get any?  With.  Yes.  Oh, good.  Of course he got some.  I pulled out onto the street and it was like I had fucking mustard gas.  I couldn't.  I couldn't see.  God damn.  It was happy March 31st.  It really was.  But I couldn't stop laughing because it was such a funny gag.  Let's say hi to Tim in Iowa.  Tim.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Tim?  Hey, when I was in the military out in Virginia back in around 90, 91, there was a couple guys  called Tommy the Bull.  I don't remember the station, but they said that an armored car had turned over. 
[00:37:00]  And what's funny was blowing.  It was a real windy day.  Money was blowing all over the place.  But they gave the intersection of two roads that ran parallel.  So with all the military, it went over pretty well because there were so many military people  there.  They weren't familiar with the area.  All of the base guys were talking about it.  Man, there was bloody blowing everywhere.  Well, then if you called in and busted them on it and said, hey, these roads don't intersect. 
[00:37:30]  What the fuck are you guys talking about?  They'd say, well, yeah, okay, now just go with it until you're out there picking up money  and everything.  And there's troopers out there saying they're busting people and everything.  It was pretty good.  That's ridiculous.  Thank you, sir.  So, yeah, the money spilled at an intersection, but it's two roads that were parallel.  So they never, what happened?  I just don't believe.  What's he doing with the facial hair?  He's trying to grow facial hair now?  The Johnny Weir guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Johnny Weir, our fucking intern that swears he's not gay. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  He's trying to grow facial hair.  I guess he saw some of those videos about beard rubbing.  Oh, he wants to be part of the beard rubbing.  He wants to get into it with somebody.  He wants to be part of the beard rubbing crowd.  He really, he kind of probably liked it, and it doesn't work.  All right, let's get a mic in Hoboken.  Hoboken.  Oh, bye.  Good morning.  What's up?  Mikey. 
[00:38:30]  Hey, guys.  Remember that radio station?  I don't know where they were.  They were at some hack-ass radio station in the Midwest that said the kitten was in the  air balloon, and it got the town all crazy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That one's been done a million.  Steve from Yellowstone on that one.  Yeah, you're right.  The PD called it.  We talked to the PD, and Steve from Yellowstone had to address.  Can we replay that today?  Yeah, why wouldn't we?  Like, I don't know if there's nothing wrong with it.  I mean, well, I mean, did Steve think ahead?  It's April Fool's, maybe play some of these pranky things all day long? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, it would be kind of cool to grab some of them.  Oh, you got them?  All right.  Oh, so we're going to play some stuff going into break?  All right.  Danny and Travis are working on some stuff.  Good.  But some long-form prank shit that we've done over the years or other stuff would be great.  Because, yeah, the kitten thing, we ended up talking to the PD, and he was all proud,  and then we beat the shit out of him.  Well, they had released a press release saying it wasn't real or something like that.  Yeah.  We challenged the—I forget what it was. 
[00:39:30]  It was the statement the station made.  We just were like, what dicks?  Yeah, yeah, the statement was one of these fake fucking statements.  That's an old-school bit.  Yeah.  Letting a kitten loose in an air balloon.  You get the whole town looking for it, like, oh, we got to save the kitten.  The kitten's gone.  He's up there.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Tom in Chicago.  Tom.  Hey there, Tam.  Hey, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, back about 10, 12, 14, 18 years ago when Man Douche was on the air,  they did this thing where they flipped the entire personnel between the black radio station 
[00:40:00]  and the white radio station.  All right.  That's kind of funny.  You turn on your radio and you expect, you know—  All of a sudden, you got the urban guys playing Leonard Skinner and the white guys playing,  I don't know what, Jay-Z?  I'll give him that.  Well, it wasn't even the calls.  It was mainly both call-ins.  So the call-ins to the white station were like, you know, people were like, what the fuck,  you know?  It was pretty good.  That race.  You know what?  That one's not bad at all. 
[00:40:30]  Very good.  Let me say hi to Steve C.  Steve C.  Yes.  If you boys need me, I'll be in my office listening to the show and doing production.  April Fool's!  And the best part of that call, Steve's walking down the hall, has no idea that guy just did that.  I know.  He did.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris, it's our big April Fool's Day show.  Yeah, Howard just did his annual one. 
[00:41:00]  He just said he's doing a show tomorrow.  You guys remember years ago, it's going to be 85, Sports Illustrated did a thing where  they had this guy who was going to pitch for the Mets.  His name was Sid Finch.  They did a whole article on him.  He was a guy who could throw the ball 200 miles an hour, and it was a wonderful story.  You actually thought the guy was real.  Of course, it was the April 1st edition.  I do remember that.  I don't know if they said he could throw.  I don't remember that one.  Did they say he could throw?  It was over 100 miles an hour.  It was well over 100.  I'm trying to remember what it was. 
[00:41:30]  It might be 150.  Yeah.  And people bought that.  Yes, I do remember that.  Jesus.  Bought it.  They must give him a contract.  Yeah.  And then he got injured.  What about who's the guy that could throw righty and lefty in?  You were telling me about yesterday.  Some minor leaguer for the Yankees.  Yeah.  Just an ambidextrous kind of guy.  You know when they were playing the minor league or just playing the spring training games.  They threw him up there and he did pretty good.  But yeah, he's a righty and a lefty, which is fucked up for a pitcher. 
[00:42:00]  It's like...  And he's pitched...  Yeah.  They threw him back down in the minors.  He's been in games as a right-hand pitcher and a left-hand pitcher?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Isn't that fucked up?  It's like...  Wow.  You would think, though, you wouldn't be as good as if you dedicated your entire training  to one arm.  Right.  You know, that's like...  Or maybe you get to rest your arm, too, though.  That, too.  You could pitch every day or every other...  Well, whatever.  You could pitch righty one day, lefty the next.  Yeah.  Take one day off and do it all over again.  But then when they, you know, try to change fucking... 
[00:42:30]  You know, you don't have to change pitchers if a left-handed batter comes up or something.  I would love...  Yeah.  Imagine the guy just switches off during...  Like, right in the middle of the fucking...  Or in the middle of the guy hitting.  How about in the middle of one batter?  Yeah.  One batter.  Like, he's fucking swinging and then you just switch on him.  He played a game a couple days ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he did that.  He went, like, a righty batter and he pitched righty.  And then a lefty batter came up and he pitched lefty.  And then they just keep switching.  I think he pitched, like, a little more than an inning. 
[00:43:00]  And that's legal?  But how about pitching after...  Yeah, you can totally do that.  Absolutely.  All right.  Hold on.  Let me...  Hold on in.  Because I...  Now, all right.  So, he switches.  What about the mitt?  How does he handle that?  He has a six-finger mitt.  Oh, so he could...  Wow.  So he could also put it on each hand.  All you got to do is put it on the other hand.  Yeah, because I wonder...  That's so fucked up.  Yeah, because they can't run a mitt out, I would assume.  No, he pitches with a special mitt.  Wow.  Special.  That's fucking cool, man.  That, uh...  Yeah, that's fucked up, man.  Yeah.  God damn. 
[00:43:30]  Steve, did you hear that phone call?  I throw a lefty.  It's total girl.  Yeah.  It's total girly throw.  You try to throw a lefty, you look like a faggot.  Can this guy go from batter to batter and rotate?  Lefty, righty, lefty, righty?  Yeah, that's amazing.  Yeah, that's what Travis was just saying.  Okay, I'm sorry, Travis.  That's, uh...  Yeah.  That's very dangerous, then, because that's going to kill fucking opposing managers.  I know.  That'd be great.  But, well, they're saying Brad Buckwalter knows a little bit more about this guy. 
[00:44:00]  Supposedly, he throws 85 miles an hour with his right hand and 77 miles an hour with his left.  So, he's got to have a little more juice when he's throwing lefty.  Definitely.  He's a kid, though, so...  Oh, is he?  He's got to get some...  He's only 24.  Yeah.  He should be throwing faster than that if he's 24.  Oh, sure.  Absolutely.  77.  He's not great.  Like...  No, I'm not saying he's an amazing...  I think he...  But just the whole tactic is...  Whoa!  What do you mean he's not great?  He can throw a football hand and actually hit the fucking glove there.  He can throw 85 miles an hour with his right hand and he can almost throw 80 miles an hour 
[00:44:30]  with his left.  That is a definition of great.  That's great in the major leagues.  He can give up fucking three-run home runs to both sides of the plate.  They're going to murder this fucking faggot.  It stinks.  Fuck him.  Oh, shit.  That's good.  You know what it is?  It's like, unless you're a negro or you're a complete junk ball thrower...  Phil Necro.  Yes.  Okay.  Sorry.  It's funny.  You know what?  You better throw really good junk balls.  How many times will I do that?  Until I don't do it anymore. 
[00:45:00]  We haven't mentioned Phil Necro on our show in how long?  A few days.  A real long time.  And you mentioned Phil Necro out of nowhere and it's his birthday.  Oh, is it?  How old is he?  71.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Really?  71 for Phil Necro.  But I mean, he's one of those guys...  Or like...  Who's the guy from Boston?  The knuckleball...  Tim Wakefield.  Tim Wakefield.  Those guys can throw slowly and murder you.  Stupid.  Oh, my.  I'm just going to say, oh, my, every time that commercial goes on.  Oh, my.  How is Sharp going to make any money?  That commercial's on so much, they can't be making money. 
[00:45:30]  No, they're spending all their money on advertising.  People love it.  They just, like, love it.  Even Travis was saying, when he has a show DVR'd, he'll fast forward through commercials  and then see that one and go, oh, no, I want to hear him say, oh, my.  I've seen the commercial...  His little scream.  I've seen the commercial four times.  We've been broadcasting for less than an hour.  Four times.  Oh, boy. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my.  Let's go to Kip in Jersey.  He's got more.  Oh, my.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  See, I can play, too.  Kip has more on that fucking pitcher.  Kip.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, actually, the minor league had to create a new rule that he has to wave his hand up 
[00:46:30]  to the ump to which person he's going to be pitching to, like which hand.  Are you shitting me?  Yeah, they created a new rule for that.  You can't create a new rule.  What the fuck is that about it?  This guy should be able to do whatever the fuck he wants out there.  I'll tell you why.  That's because they think that this way that the other managers will know who to send up  because he's made the declaration of which side he's going to pitch.  Right.  That's bullshit.  Of course, it's by great.  It is bullshit.  That's fucking bullshit.  You get your own fucking pitcher that can do this.  Do they have to fucking put their hands up if they're going to bunt or if they're going  to fucking try to sacrifice?  No.  Yeah.  How about that? 
[00:47:00]  Hey, wait.  What about...  Hold on.  Hold on.  What about the...  Hold on.  Did we fix the phone volume?  Because that's going to drive everybody nuts, us and the callers.  I'm not blaming you, sir.  But for some reason, you guys can't hear us at times, which is really frustrating.  Isn't it true that a hitter could change?  You make a pitch...  No, you can't do that.  Wait, no.  If you make a pitch...  In the middle of an at-bat?  Why not?  Hold on.  Hold on.  If you make a pitching change, you can't now switch over to...  Oh, yes, you can.  That's what I'm saying.  Before the at-bat, but in the middle of an at-bat, you can't do that. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, I think if you're committed to yourself, you have to stick with it.  But why?  I don't understand.  What the fuck do they care for?  What I'm saying is if the manager brings in now a righty and you're allowed to move to  a left-handed batting position, why couldn't a pitcher just fuck around?  I agree.  I agree.  Right?  Good point.  Yeah.  They should be able to.  Then all of a sudden, everybody's turning around lefty, righty.  Nobody knows who's hitting which direction.  And then it'll be a nine-hour game instead of a four-hour game.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, so what are you going to do?  Why don't you just throw what you left and right hand together over your head like I'm shooting 
[00:48:00]  in the hopes of something to park?  It's crazy.  Good suggestion.  Thanks.  All right.  Later, guys.  Hey, Kip.  Kip.  Yes.  All right.  Oh, Kip.  Oh, Kip.  Let's go to Brian in Cleveland.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  Thanks for the call.  Thanks, Brian.  Bye.  Back when I was in the military back in the late 90s in Norfolk, PETA had their headquarters  there, and Tommy and Rumble had a PETA fishing derby.  It turned into a giant clusterfuck. 
[00:48:30]  Like, the savages down there started throwing dead fish at the building.  When the PETA people came out, was throwing, like, red paint at the people.  A bunch of people got arrested.  It was great.  What was the fishing thing, though?  They just had a regular fishing derby?  Yeah, just a regular fishing derby, like, right outside of the PETA building.  Sounds like a thrill a minute.  Wow, wow.  Did I just flame out?  I thought it was a good story.  You know how I tried to help you, too, and I just had nothing for you. 
[00:49:00]  Just say April Fool's.  Yeah.  You made us take a call.  All right.  Sorry, guys.  Turk February rules.  See you, guys.  Turk February is fantastic.  You know, I actually watched a movie because of Turk February last night.  Really?  Yep.  I was so fixated on Jimmy's character in his new novel that he's penning, Turk February,  that I felt compelled to watch Cobra last night. 
[00:49:30]  Ooh.  Because the character kind of reminded me of Marion Cabretti.  Yeah.  Um, and, uh...  Except Turk doesn't chew a toothpick.  It's a matchstick.  Turk doesn't chew that.  What is he?  A cigarette butt that's been smoked.  Really?  Yes.  He just has that in his...  But, yeah, like the ash end first in his mouth.  Ugh.  Crime is disease.  Meet the cure.  Oh, he's got the shades.  Was Cobra a good movie?  I don't remember.  I don't deal with psychos. 
[00:50:00]  What does he say?  Like, I don't talk to psychos.  I say...  Oh!  Ah!  I don't talk to psychos.  You're the disease.  I'm the cure.  Cure.  Yeah.  Eh.  Eh.  He had, like, four words.  But that was a good catchphrase.  You're the disease, I'm the cure.  Oh, it was great.  That was one of the better ones.  It was fantastic.  From that here.  It had everything.  It had him being yelled at by his superior in the office.  Cobra damage!  Where he's sitting there. 
[00:50:30]  God damn it!  How many people...  It had the evil 80s press guys with the microphone in his face going,  Did you have to use deadly force, Cobretti?  So Cop Out parodied all that.  Oh, absolutely.  They probably parodied a lot of that movie.  He brings the reporter.  First of all, they don't cordon off the area where a grocery store has just been completely shot up.  The perp is dead now because Cobretti fucking kills him.  And the press is running right up to the front door.  As Cobretti comes out. 
[00:51:00]  And they got microphones in his face.  Like, they can't even cordon off the area.  And they're asking him, you know, did you have to do that?  The liberal press is like, man, why'd you have to kill him, man?  And he grabs the reporter.  And the cameras are rolling.  And he goes over to the gurney and pulls up the sheet and shows, why did you say that to your family?  Please, we got, oh, look, Danny's got some of it up.  Yay.  It is so bad.  He's wearing the fucking short 80s jacket. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, and his sunglasses, he's wearing them in the dark.  Like, it's dark.  And he wears his sunglasses.  Well, you see that a lot.  He's got the gloves, the jackets, the sleeves.  The jacket sleeves are kind of open and wild.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He's a good music player.  Oh, the music is fantastic.  Fantastic.  And now he has an egg carton, but you know what's in his egg carton?  His gun cleaning kit.  His gun cleaning kit. 
[00:52:00]  So he's going to clean his gun.  And he's going to slice a pizza.  Why was he wearing the sunglasses?  Why?  Why would he wear his sunglasses all the time?  It is such a bad movie.  And then the thrilling climax at the end, where the psychopath, who for some reason has cronies,  even though he just kills people.  There's no upside for the cronies in this.  Bad guy cronies are usually like, they're doing a robbery, they're stealing things. 
[00:52:30]  This nut guy, this crazy guy, is just killing people.  But he has cronies hanging around that help him.  Why?  Like hundreds of them.  Yeah, how are they making their money?  There's no upside for them.  How are they making their money?  Exactly.  Are they in training?  Uh-oh.  There is no end to it.  Oh, here he is.  There's dialogue.  Uh-oh.  Why?  I don't deal with psychos.  Psychos.  I ain't no psycho, man.  I'm a hero. 
[00:53:00]  You're looking at a fucking hunter.  I'm a hero of the new world.  What?  You're a disease.  You don't make a cure.  Die!  Yeah!  Drop it!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Cobretti!  The fallback with the wide jacket flailing wildly.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, his movie's fucking steak.  It had everything.  Every fucking cliche was in that movie, and it was fantastic to watch. 
[00:53:30]  He's atrocious.  Yeah, at the end, it's in a warehouse, kind of factory thingy, that for some reason, OSHA  would walk in there and shut it down in a second.  There's fire everywhere, and molten metal pouring.  No one's working there, by the way.  There was one security guard, and then they're in there, and things are just burning, like  a doorway is on fire, and a ladder is in flames, for no reason. 
[00:54:00]  Just to make it look good.  This place is on fire.  And then there's hooks just rotating around the building.  Doing nothing.  It was the most insane place.  This place shouldn't exist.  Like, who's working at this place?  It exists in a video game world.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, you jump up and hit your head on a coin, and get some shit.  But look, there's fire everywhere.  Oh, it's the big fucking scene.  The big end scene.  But the factory, what do they make here?  You don't need to know.  They make fire.  They make shitty movies. 
[00:54:30]  Stallone's the foreman.  God, does he suck?  Yeah, you have to.  And it had the big ending, where he goes, you have to take me in, pig.  You can't kill me.  The law says you have to take me in.  Gives him the big speech about how he's got to be civil, you know, and take him in.  And he'll get out.  Well, you're pissing off Tommy in Queens.  Tommy.  What?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Oh, I know.  Tommy.  Tommy's a regular at this point. 
[00:55:00]  Tommy.  Tommy.  I'm a little upset.  I love Sly.  I love that fucking movie.  I based my life on that.  What?  Cobra?  Then fucking kill your Sackley.  Hopefully you have a disease.  For which there is no cure, if you know what I mean.  And you don't want Tommy killing himself.  He's one of you.  No, no.  He's one of your soldiers, bro.  Oh, is he?  Okay.  He thinks very much like yourself.  Well, let me tell you something.  Have you watched Cobra lately?  Look at that doorway.  It's on fire.  Probably the last time I seen it was probably about a year and a half ago. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You're saying the movie doesn't hold up, man?  Jesus.  It doesn't hold up.  I think right after this came out.  What about the car?  What about the 49?  You mean Awesome 50?  Oh, this is terrible.  Awesome 50, his car?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, he drives around in a classic car, and it gets all smashed up.  And you like when the essays bump into it.  The tough guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's the best.  All right, listen, we've got to move on because we've got a bunch of things happening. 
[00:56:00]  Before.  I can't get to see you, boys.  Come on.  Hold on.  One last thing on that pitcher, and then we're going to move on to Guy Earl, who's on our hotline.  Mike in Boston.  Mike, we were talking about that pitcher that throws 80 with his right and 77 with his left.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Mike, to wrap up that thing.  Mike.  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, apparently there's a clip on YouTube where this prick last year is pitching, and he gets on the rubber,  and the guy at the plate is a switch hitter.  So he's moving to the left.  The other guy's moving to the right.  And finally, it goes back and forth maybe a couple minutes, and the ump just has to say, 
[00:56:30]  cut the shit.  Oh, okay.  That's funny, though, to watch.  Because we were confused why the ump would do that, but it was a basically, it was a cut the shit.  All right, you're lining up to pitch that way.  I'm going to hit this way.  Oh, so they had to make the rule.  That's funny.  If you have a switch hitter and a guy that could throw either arm, yeah.  Then you've got to switch and throw real quick.  Now the game never ends.  Switch and throw real quick before he can change back.  All right, now it makes sense, see?  Okay.  The judge, the ump had to do that. 
[00:57:00]  All right, we've got to say hi.  I know it's on YouTube, so.  All right, cool.  Thank you, Mikey.  Oh, Kevin.  Now we've got Guy Earl on the line.  He's the comedian from Canada.  Right, right.  Okay, let's get right into this.  Who's having a human rights issue, which this story has been driving me fucking crazy.  Guy?  Yeah.  Hey, man, how are you?  It's been driving you crazy.  How do you think I feel?  Yeah, it's got to be, dude, it's got to be enraging.  Now, for anybody that's not up to speed, we'll have him walk us through the basics.  Guy, what happened that night, just to refresh everyone's memory there? 
[00:57:30]  Well, I could have used a guy that can pitch with both arms, that's for sure.  I tell you that.  But, okay, so I was hosting an open mic night for the last seven months in this bar every Tuesday night.  Career's going well, huh?  Oh, no, I got a day gig.  I do this for the love of the art form.  Oh, okay.  I promote stand-up by providing a stage for amateurs, and I help them through it. 
[00:58:00]  And there's hundreds of comics with a little bit of guy in them.  All right.  Anyway, we'll leave that one go.  Well, now we know why you got arrested.  There's no surprise there.  What can I say?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.  So, anyway, I had these girls with comfortable shoes came into my, in the middle of my show, at the end of my show.  And they were talking loud over the show.  I don't think they were well-trained with what a comedy show is all about.  So, I gave them a few chances. 
[00:58:30]  You know, I'm trying to get them to be quiet and attend to the show.  I brought up another comic.  They talked through his entire act.  I went back up.  Am I allowed to swear?  Yeah, yeah, you can.  I went back up, and they were like, fuck you.  You're an asshole.  You're not funny.  And which I responded, oh, yeah, well, you're not lesbian.  You're just fat and ugly, and nobody will fuck you.  That's great.  You do what you showed on as a comic.  They hit you, and you fucking hit back hard.  Yeah, man.  I'm known to be brutal to hecklers.  That's part of my charm. 
[00:59:00]  Good.  And the whole thing of this show, people used to come to the show because I have these douchebag amateur comics that are half-assed, and half the time I'm abusing them.  So, I mean, people came to the show because it's this kind of a nature.  It's an edgy comedy show.  You guys know what I'm talking about.  It's not everybody's cup of tea.  Oh, that shit.  Language.  You ring the bell every time.  You know, in Vancouver, they got some weird laws, and one of them is at 11 o'clock, you can't be drinking on the patio of a bar. 
[00:59:30]  So, these guys were outside the whole time, all through the show.  They were there before I even got there at 7 o'clock.  I was out there marking, putting the sign out, edgy's show in Vancouver, and I'm like, hey, guys, you should come in for the comedy show.  And they're like, no, we're not interested.  We're just here hanging out, na-na-na-na-na.  And, you know, I went out there a couple times and invited them in.  And they were on the other side of the wall outside, and I don't think they had any inclination to be part of the show. 
[01:00:00]  So, when they came in, you have to understand, this area of Vancouver is very lesbionic.  Oh, yeah.  Commercial drive.  It's just like Lesbianville, which shows I'm not homophobic because why the hell would I open up a show in Lesbianville unless I didn't care?  So, early, hold on.  She comes in with her friend, and they're being like, and I know exactly what you mean.  They're being loud and annoying, and as a comic, your job is just to, you want to just fucking murder them.  When did it get really nasty? 
[01:00:30]  Like, she said to you, you're not funny, and then you responded to her.  What was the progression after the initial conflict?  Well, I gave them three chances.  Like, it's like, shut the fuck up.  Can we move on?  No, we can't.  Okay, thanks very much.  And when they said, fuck you, you're an asshole, you're not funny, and I just ripped a new one off them.  Like I said, I'm like, you're fat and ugly, nobody will fuck you.  Somebody put a dick in her mouth, started the fuck up.  What happens when you're both on the rag?  Who gets to choose who goes on a fishing trip?  Which one of you wears a strap on? 
[01:01:00]  Because that's Silicon Cock Crazy.  It's still Cock Crazy in my book.  Maybe you're not lesbian.  Maybe you're just experimenting and half drunk, and you want me to fuck you.  Well, guess what?  I'm not going to.  You know, stuff like this.  You just unloaded, basically.  You had enough of these two.  Yeah.  And half the amateur comics are going, ooh, and I'm like, shut up.  I provide a stage for you.  You guys don't even know what traditional stand-up's all about.  Yeah.  By the way, there's nothing worse than a comedian going, ooh.  I know.  And siding with the audience, little faggots. 
[01:01:30]  And this is a kind of abusive room where it's usually just comics in the audience anyway,  so it's like people are heckling each other.  It's free for all.  And like I said, people come to the show.  Never take sides against the comedian again.  Yeah, well, we have like a cult following, people that are obviously sick in the head,  but they just want to see us be abusive and whatnot.  That's the art form.  Sorry.  But this is a place where offensive stuff goes down, and the Human Rights Tribunal doesn't have the jurisdiction to stick their frickin' nose in there. 
[01:02:00]  Hold on, let me ask you.  Now, this is, again, in the States, we don't know if we have the Human Rights Tribunal.  So this woman basically is suing you.  It was a setup, man.  It was a setup.  Well, did she go, does the tribunal, is this a statement on Canada's free speech or political correctness,  or is this one citizen, like in the U.S., if I said something to somebody on stage,  they could technically sue me, even though they probably would not win.  Right.  Is that what this is?  Well, this is a super legal judicial group. 
[01:02:30]  This has nothing to do with the law.  These guys are like pseudo law.  So we still have the civil courts like you guys do in case we wanted to take out of court for whatever.  Same mechanism there.  But we have this extra kangaroo court that kind of moves above the law,  and it's, for me, it's scary because this could be a stimulus package for hecklers, you know? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  You can go to an open mic night and make a good $10,000 on a free comedy show.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Is the Human Rights Tribunal, is the idea of that,  are they saying, like, if you persecute somebody because they're gay or black or anything but white, basically,  which we all know how that works,  is there any, is that what they're for, supposedly to stop people from being persecuted?  Yeah.  Well, there's a bunch of different sections in their code.  One of them deals with hate speech. 
[01:03:30]  Another one deals with the discrimination of the provision of service.  What is that?  I'm sorry.  What is hate speech considered?  Like, as a stand-up, would that be considered hate speech?  It won't be an anthony show.  Well, from what my understanding is, hate speech is when you're actually inciting violence  and trying to get people to beat other people up or, you know what I mean?  Okay, that's actually, all right, that's not protected here either.  You can't incite people to violence or to court crimes.  So, yeah, I think it's just different terminology, but basically we have the same system, I think, 
[01:04:00]  except that we never had Lenny Bruce put down the pavement here.  And it's just, these guys don't understand that there can't be, like I said, I was set up.  These girls went in there.  They knew if they could get me going and they could goad me,  that they have a mechanism to go to the Human Rights Tribunal and try to seek damages.  That was pre, that was, they knew about that.  They were not intimidated.  I didn't physically intimidate them or single them out because of their sexuality. 
[01:04:30]  They were making out and flipping me the bird saying, this is Commercial Drive.  We're lesbians.  We own this place.  We don't care if you're doing a frickin' comedy show.  So, it was really frustrating.  And now it's been three years of my frickin' life dealing with these girls.  This was three years ago?  Yeah, it says it right there.  May 2007.  This travels slow up there like molasses.  This has been going on for three years.  No surprise with the courts.  Lorna Party is the woman.  Now, is she paying legal fees?  Is she paying legal fees, Earl? 
[01:05:00]  Oh, no, man.  I'm sorry.  She's being covered by the Gov, man.  This is a government-sponsored cash grab.  It's offensive.  That's fuckin' sickening.  And you have to pay for your own attorney?  Of course.  I have to pay for everything.  I've been flying across the frickin' country.  But guys, I gotta tell you this, man.  This is huge news.  I'm so frickin' excited.  As of last night...  I have to clear that up.  As of last night, a major development here.  As you guys may know, my lawyer walked out on Monday at the beginning of the tribunal 
[01:05:30]  to say that these proceedings are illegal because we quashed them through the Supreme Court.  Like, they're talking about this in frickin' Parliament down here.  Wow.  So what we did was we said that since they circumvented our charter of freedom here, we're saying that the proceedings are illegal.  And today, my lawyer's going to the Supreme Court and we're charging the Human Rights Commission with contempt, baby.  Good.  Oh, yeah.  So what can happen to...  Because to me, that commission, if it works, like, as an additional thing, it basically... 
[01:06:00]  It almost seems like it's not needed because if you violate somebody's civil rights, that's covered under the law, I'm sure, in Canada as well as here.  Absolutely.  So it's probably...  It really is like a political correct policing.  And this Lorna Party, I'm just looking at her and I fucking hate her.  I hate her guts and I don't like her Dimitri Martin hairdo.  No, she's a big, fat liar.  Well, she's not fat, but she's a liar.  She's not fat and ugly, so that proves that I was frickin' joking.  Yeah, of course. 
[01:06:30]  That'll help you out.  Now, you could become the new Lenny Bruce of Canada there.  She looks like Dave Grohl in the early days.  Well, you know, in the beginning, this is pretty overwhelming because I just fight for the right for comics to get up there and be offensive, even offend me.  That's my game.  I care about our form of stand-up.  Now it's a battle about free speech in Canada.  It's huge.  Like, this battle is bigger than me.  So I'm actually, at this point, I'm kind of honored to be the poster boy in this battle. 
[01:07:00]  And with that said, a lot of people trying to get a hold of you?  Oh, man.  Talk to you?  My 30th interview in three days.  Well, is it helping you stand-up at all?  You would have thought some of those jokes wouldn't work.  Well, I'm actually off the beaten path.  I moved back here from Vancouver for a job, and I've got a new kid.  I'm kind of taking a little break right now.  And when this whole thing settles, I'll be back, baby.  You know it.  So, yeah, you should hopefully help you draw a little bit.  But, I mean, it is really, really enraging, though, that Canada would entertain this fucking nonsense. 
[01:07:30]  I mean, look, just because you're a stand-up, and they're going to say just because you're a stand-up,  you can't behave any way you want to somebody and not be held accountable just because you're a stand-up.  You know, you can't actually violate somebody's civil rights.  Yeah, but I'm on stage performing, right?  So, we've got a publication.  We have all kinds of speech issues here that are in the Charter of Canada.  They're being circumvented by this quasi-legal group of arseholes. 
[01:08:00]  So, yeah, I tell you what, though, I've got material coming out of my ass right now.  I could go on stage for four hours the way I'm feeling.  I guess we'll have to believe you.  So, why aren't you still performing?  Like I said, I've got a newborn, and I've got the day gig, and I'm off the beaten path.  So, it's just not really convenient.  I'd rather get this over with.  And, yeah, I'll be back.  How much has it cost you so far? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, well, I've moved across the country three times.  It's been three years of loss.  They've got free court care up there.  What's that?  Free court care.  Free court care, I think.  You get that.  I don't know, man.  Oh, just a joke.  It's a government-sponsored cash grab is what it is.  I agree.  How much have you spent?  I can't put a figure on it, man.  It's been three years of my life.  I've changed my lifestyle.  I've made changes of where I work. 
[01:09:00]  So have I.  Have you changed?  Have you spent more than $20,000?  I would say so.  Oh, I would say, yeah.  Canadian?  Hey, man, that's like $25,000 American now.  I know.  I know.  They've got the upper hand right now, Ant.  I know.  That joke doesn't work these days.  No, I'm just teasing.  We can switch the joke now.  So what do you mean you had to change jobs and all that?  Why?  Well, because I had to leave Vancouver because these guys got the homosexual community to  threaten bars that they would boycott their establishment if they let me perform. 
[01:09:30]  Very good free speech.  Very good special interest group free speech.  Are you kidding me?  We don't like what he's saying, so we won't drink there.  They don't protest.  By the way, they wouldn't say that if somebody drank in the bar and drunk drove and killed  somebody.  Boycott.  No, I know.  I know.  These guys, they have a mandate to put themselves on the map and we're supposed to respect  whatever, whatever.  It's like, you know, I don't get the same credence being a white heterosexual.  And what's the personification of my character? 
[01:10:00]  You're an asshole.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm sorry to hear it, man.  It's because people have been Twittering me about it a lot and asking me, you know,  what I think.  I don't know.  Look, I think it stinks for you.  I really do.  And it's like, it's easy to comment if it was here in the U.S.  because I'm more familiar with the, but it really doesn't bode well.  I know Canada is very, very politically correct and they're even worse than we are in certain  cases, which is hard to imagine.  Well, it would shut down stand up.  Yeah.  I mean, what guy would go up there and make fun of anybody? 
[01:10:30]  Well, that's right.  If you lose this.  If somebody heckles you, you have to make sure that they're not part of a protected group  before you respond.  No kidding.  That is sickening.  Once this fucking woman, and I'm looking at her and I hate her guts on sight, I despise  her fucking striped shirt.  And as far as I'm concerned as a comic, you did fucking absolutely the right thing.  Of course.  If she was talking and making out with her fucking girlfriend, you should have verbally  destroyed her.  You did exactly what you should have done.  All right.  But, you know, it is a state of despair, this politically correct nature of this country. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  And I just want to mention, that's what stand ups are for.  We're the pointy edge of the stick.  We're the canaries in the coal mine of free speech.  Oh, here we go.  We're the guys that are offensive and trying to push the freaking pendulum back to where  it belongs.  Ah, yes.  I understand.  The other way.  We're taking these numb nuts to freaking Supreme Court.  We're going to change this freaking country.  We're going to make history this week.  And I just did my little part to make this place a little bit more crude. 
[01:11:30]  And I feel so proud about it.  I like the way you handle it, too.  You're not apologetic about it.  No, I'm not apologizing to those bastards.  I do hope that you get what you want, man.  It's like little stuff like this actually does sometimes change the loss.  So good luck, man.  We hope you win.  And when are you going to have more news?  Hopefully this week?  I guess maybe Monday or Tuesday we'll have an update there.  All right.  Well, keep us posted, man.  I would really like to know what's going on with that.  Because, again, I'm going to be in Canada performing in fucking July.  So hopefully a nice kick in the balls for that politically correct system. 
[01:12:00]  Good for you, man.  I'd love to come down there and do some shows for you guys any time, buddy.  Yeah, we'll be in touch with that.  We'll figure it out for you.  All right, Guy.  Good luck, man.  Stay by the phone.  Yeah, we'll figure something out for you, Guy.  Okay.  Guy Earl.  Good luck, buddy.  Guy Earl.  Wow, that's enraging.  It's fucking...  I was going to say his call.  I didn't care about that.  No, you know what it is?  Come on.  It's just a fucking joke.  His jokes were a little wrong. 
[01:12:30]  Dude, as he's talking, I don't give a fuck.  I'm fucking biting.  My jaw is moving to one direction.  I'm thinking about this heckler.  It's really annoying.  Yeah.  Of course it is.  Of course.  They should have no fucking juice when they go into a comedy club.  All bets are off.  You sit there.  You watch the show.  You don't like it.  You can get up and leave.  Fucking leave.  It's those people that have to fucking say things and then take it to court.  Get the fuck out of here.  British Columbia human rights and they're fucking targeting a stand-up, these fucking cunts. 
[01:13:00]  How about...  Why wouldn't they target like a movie or a play or any other form of entertainment where  maybe you don't like what you see going on on stage?  Why is it okay to just stand up and yell shit out and then sue the performer?  But Ant, they'll do that next.  That's why you got to push back with these things.  Nip it in the bud, eh?  That's right.  That's why you got to fight all this shit.  Yeah.  Like, I think you taught me years ago.  They don't stop there.  They just keep on going.  They never pack up and leave.  They keep on going to the next thing. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think he was set up.  I disagree with that.  I don't know the women, but I honestly don't think it's like the set up to me.  I ran into a couple of cunts.  Yeah, just a couple of twats.  Yeah, I think it was consequences.  Yeah, we're going to go and sue you.  We're going to go to the human rights team because he smashed their fucking faces.  Yeah.  All right, we should take a break.  She is ugly, too, by the way.  In the middle of that, I said, holy shit, 10 million.  I'll explain next.  Unbelievable.  That is fucking, I saw the same thing.  Unbelievable.  I didn't mean to jump in on the interview, but that just shocked me.  We'll explain the 10 million thing and, oh, fuck, we got way too much to do. 
[01:14:00]  We'll figure it out.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  No, this is the wrong Bill.  Well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill, uh, Bill died today.  Yeah, kid, oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who is this?  He was in a car accident today. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, no.  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him.  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pile up.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John.  All right.  Thanks.  You know what? 
[01:15:30]  Uh, I was with Roland at a fucking hockey game.  And he goes, uh, yeah, Roger, his brother's gonna go to see Pearl Jam.  I, I, I have to do this.  I don't give a shit if it's plugola, payola.  I don't give a shit.  Uh-oh.  Someone get me Pearl Jam tickets.  I've never seen Pearl Jam, and I want to go see Pearl Jam.  They're doing two dates at, uh, the Garden in May.  Yeah, I want to go.  I'm going to both.  How'd you get your tickets?  I'm in their fan club.  Motherfucker.  Here, I get the good seats. 
[01:16:00]  No, I'll pay for tickets.  No, I'm not.  I'm very straight.  No.  Pearl Jam's a very manly fan.  Why is he gay for liking Pearl Jam?  No, no, no.  Not liking Pearl Jam.  Oh, because of the fan club?  Yeah, that's a little rough.  Like, if you're in a fan club.  That's one step away from beard rubbing.  It's so worth it to pay $20 a year.  Or whatever it is to get, like, first crack at tickets.  Because these are really, like, they give you the best seats.  Really?  Yeah.  It's definitely worth it.  How many times have you seen Pearl Jam?  Uh, this will be, I think, a 12.  God damn it.  You know, my favorite bands of the last 15 years, I've never seen. 
[01:16:30]  I was a big Nirvana fan.  Never saw Nirvana.  Huge Alice in Chains fan.  Never saw Alice in Chains.  I can get your tickets for Nirvana.  Cheap.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Ooh.  And Pearl Jam was another biggie I liked.  And, uh, never saw for some reason.  So, I gotta see Pearl Jam.  They're, in my opinion, in their best lives.  And are they doing that, uh, that dead thing?  They're getting a little trippy and their songs are a little longer and...  No, they don't.  No.  I guess, like, as far as, uh...  For an hour?  As far as comparisons to the dead, maybe they just...  I mean, they play for, like, you know, three hours and they'll play... 
[01:17:00]  It's never the same set list.  They're great.  Yeah, I gotta see Pearl Jam.  You ever see Pearl Jam, man?  Yeah.  Back at, uh, Roseland.  Oh, that was the famous show?  Yeah.  You saw Smashing Pumpkins, Pearl Jam, what was the third?  And Chili Peppers.  Jesus Christ, we're in a lineup.  And I was talking about how fucking Smashing Pumpkins were a shit band that'll never go anywhere.  Because they were, like, the opener.  Yeah.  They were, like, the fucking opening band.  And the Peppers were the fucking headliner.  You know?  They were the ones headlining.  What album?  This was before, uh, Blood Sugar, Sex, Magic, right? 
[01:17:30]  It might have been.  It had to be.  It might have been Blood Sugar.  But people forget, man.  Fucking, before Blood Sugar, Sex, Magic, the band was already huge.  Yeah.  A little more, uh, a huge underground band, I guess.  Mother's Milk or something like that?  Oh, that was with, uh, the Higher Ground, right?  Yeah.  It was off that album, I think.  I can't stand the Hot Chili Peppers anymore.  I fucking hate them.  I liked them back in the day, as they say.  The Day.  Like, Behind the Sun.  Behind the Sun. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  All that stuff.  Good shit.  And then everything started sounding the same.  Yeah.  Although, Blood Sugar, Sex, Magic is a great fucking album.  That is.  Great album.  Great album right there.  I know I've beaten up Pearl Jam a lot, but Coke Logic sent me a, uh, I like their cover  of, uh, of the Ramones, I Believe in Miracles.  I love that song.  And they, Pearl Jam and Better, they're fucking, I heard a live version and a studio version.  And they do a great cover of that song.  I love it.  Yeah, it's great.  I love when Pearl Jam slows it down.  Elderly woman behind the counter in a small town. 
[01:18:30]  I never heard that.  One of my fucking favorites.  I hate those.  I hate the slow Pearl Jam fucking plotting.  Why?  I, you have something against Pearl Jam.  No.  What is it, Anders?  Rick and I, hey.  Gage is just on my fan club, gets tickets to my show.  See, this one's great because then when he says, I just want to scream hello, everyone  screams hello.  Yeah.  That's great.  And you rub beards and go home. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  All right.  That's Eddie Vedder.  Eddie Vedder's looking like Dr. Michi Kaku with that hair.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh, that's not the circle.  Perfect.  This is from 03?  No.  That's I Believe in Miracles.  The video we're watching right there is from 03.  Yeah, the video I have of this is from, it's I Believe in Miracles from 03.  Holy shit.  He dies it now, I think.  But he was great for a long time, right, Travis? 
[01:19:30]  Vedder?  Travis, you know.  Wait.  Vedder?  Yeah, he was.  You know, looking.  Okay, you're right.  You know, that God sucks.  He does two things to guys.  He either makes all your hair go away at an early age or he makes you go gray at an early  age.  God.  What the fuck?  How about you allow some guys to keep all their hair and not fucking go gray?  Oh, Yellow Leadbedder?  Right on.  If you want to talk about slowing down some Pearl Jam.  What about Yellow Leadbedder, Ant?  No.  Give me like even full. 
[01:20:00]  Yellow Leadbedder?  Is that about Leadbelly?  It's a great song.  Travis, you got a little Yellow, uh, uh, I don't know.  Leadbelly's name was Hedy.  I believe Hedy Ledbetter.  So probably.  I don't listen to the words.  I'm not a listen to the words guy.  I just like to kind of.  The words, man.  Yeah, Yellow Leadbedder is a good one, too.  I've heard this.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy would like Pearl Jam.  No, I don't.  He's got a good voice, but I don't love that style of singing.  I mean, the guy has a good voice, obviously. 
[01:20:30]  Love to.  I love the soundtrack to Into the Wild that Eddie Vedder did.  Travis, you like that?  Yeah, that was very good.  Very good, right?  Yeah.  I've heard this.  Redoing Black Sun.  What the fuck is he saying?  You better know.  You can't be a word person with fucking Eddie Vedder.  Her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her. 
[01:21:00]  Her, her, her, her, her, her, her.  Mona said, I want to leave Ben again.  Oh, that's funny.  Oh, the wheel.  On a wizard.  On a whale.  Anna Nicole Mama said, I want to see Anna fall down again.  This is great.  And a wizard.  I want to leave a gump.  I know.  I said, I don't want a whale in a box or a bag. 
[01:21:30]  I forget where I found this video, but it makes me laugh.  It's great.  Every time I watch it.  I think if you YouTube Yellow Lead better, it actually comes up first before Pearl.  Before Pearl.  Before Pearl.  Before Pearl.  The actual.  Well, explain what we're saying.  It's misheard lyrics.  Basically, someone tried to figure out what the hell Eddie Vedder is singing and just  found pictures to go with what he's hearing phonetically.  Yeah.  It's pretty funny.  It's really funny. 
[01:22:00]  Make me fries.  Make me fries.  That is funny, man.  Where can they find this, Danny?  YouTube Yellow Lead better.  It'll be the first thing.  All right.  Cool.  It's really fucking funny.  And they're saying that tour is blood sugar sex magic that you saw.  Yeah, it probably was.  You didn't think Smashing Pumpkins was going to make it?  No.  I like the Smashing Pumpkins.  You don't like the Smashing Pumpkins?  Nope.  Don't like them either.  They're fucking fans of the show.  They mentioned us on one of their interviews. 
[01:22:30]  I'm sorry.  With SiriusXM.  I really, I just, I'm not into that kind of music.  Billy Corgan, I believe, mentioned us.  Which one of their big songs?  Oh, my God.  Too Manish kind of music.  1979, I like.  Man.  Give us a little 1979.  I don't know any of that era.  What, are we turning into lithium in front of everyone's eyes right now?  Dude, I don't know any of that era.  It was a great era.  Where were you?  Danny, you didn't like this era?  Fucking bodybuilding.  This is more of that.  I mean, it's all about, for me, lithium.  Yeah, I know lithium.  I fucking love the lithium. 
[01:23:00]  I only listen to lithium.  Yeah, I'm stuck in 1994.  And I just can't leave.  Yeah, I can't fucking leave.  What was it?  Bullet with Butterfly Wings.  Yeah.  Bullet with Butterfly Wings was a great song.  I've heard that.  They did a great remake of Landslide.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I got that on my iPhone, actually.  Let's do that today.  You know the other band I can't fucking stand is those two brothers that could never get  along.  The Jonas Brothers?  The Bacon.  Oasis?  Oasis.  Robert and John Kennedy.  Sucks a fat dick.  Oh, dude. 
[01:23:30]  I hate Oasis.  It's not like the Beatles.  Oh, well, they sound like the Beatles.  You don't like Wonderwall?  No.  The whiny, whiny songs.  Some might say it's not bad.  Some might say.  That was an all right Oasis song.  What was it called?  Their first album.  Definitely, maybe.  It's a pain supernova.  Shut up, this guy.  What is that?  What is that?  They had a...  I didn't like everything they did, but Oasis has a few fucking monster songs, man.  Come on.  I like when Anthony becomes incensed over very unimportant things. 
[01:24:00]  You know, it's the best.  Like, it all depends on if he likes it.  Because, you know, poetic license when you sing, it doesn't always make sense.  And, you know, he won't say...  Like, if you look at a stairway to heaven, what is it?  Yeah.  It doesn't exist.  We all get incensed over the dumbest things on the show, though.  But it's just funny.  We all do that.  He's the king of it, but...  Stairway to heaven.  Shut up!  Shut up!  What is that?  Stairway to heaven!  What does it mean?  I really do get angry.  I do like this song. 
[01:24:30]  I'm a grunge hack.  I know the first, like, four words of every song, and then I don't know them anymore.  He's whining through this.  This Oasis?  Oh, yeah.  This is a fucking great song.  This was very popular.  Yeah.  Nice.  I like this one. 
[01:25:00]  Love this fucking song.  Right there on the front page of 90srockers.com.  It's on Top Songs, Wonderwall, Oasis.  What?  What is this site?  90s Rockers.  90s Rockers.  Give me the list.  Well, I just...  I mean, I guess I could get more somewhere.  But under Top Songs, the first three lists are Under the Bridge, Red Hot Chili Peppers,  Wonderwall, Oasis, and November Rain.  Great song.  That was November Rain. 
[01:25:30]  November Rain was epic, is right.  Epic.  Not an epic fail.  This is everything I listen to, like Nirvana, House of Change.  I still have Collective Soul albums somewhere.  How many gigs did we do with Collective Soul over the years, Ed?  Enough with the Collective Soul.  They were at our radio station every other week.  I was turning it goddamn...  Here's another opportunity for me to just kiss Verizon's ass.  Yeah.  They have so many fucking music channels where, you know, falling asleep at night, just pop 
[01:26:00]  on some music.  Found one of these stations that just play fucking music like this.  You do realize you work for SiriusXM.  Yeah, but you know what?  You might not want to say that.  No, I could even find something that...  Honestly, I don't give a shit.  I love listening to Lithium.  But I could find something that's even a little more niche-y than Lithium, as far as  music I like.  As I was listening to...  Because they'll play this shit, but then all of a sudden I'm also hearing some fucking  Dio.  You know?  I could listen to some fucking Dio. 
[01:26:30]  I was falling asleep to Dio.  The 90s.  And even some Ozzy last night.  Don't you love Dio?  Fucking Dio rules.  Sick, though.  I love...  I know.  I hear he's doing better.  I hear he's doing better, too.  I heard that.  I'm hoping he's got stomach cancer.  Stomach cancer, right?  But I heard he's been going to the Mayo Clinic, Jim said, back and forth every few weeks for  treatment, so hopefully he's okay.  Named after E-Rock.  Yes, of course.  As far as the Lithium Era goes, Era, whatever, there was a lot of bands with just one hit  that were fucking great, too.  I was listening to it last night, and then all of a sudden Our Lady Peace comes on. 
[01:27:00]  Were they a one-hit wonder, you think?  Well, they had Navid, and then they had another one that kind of had...  Around the Lake.  Well, that was the album, yeah.  What was the name of that one?  No, that wasn't Our Lady Peace.  Oh, Our Lady Peace.  No, Our Lady Peace.  I'm sorry.  I got my bands mixed up.  Our Lady Peace is a really good band.  They had a few tunes, but they had a lot of fucking radio hits.  Possum Kingdom.  Possum Kingdom.  Right.  Who did that?  That was the Toadies.  Toadies, yeah.  Remember what?  Dishwalla.  Dishwalla.  Oh, Counting Blue Cars.  Counting Blue Cars.  Ant and I interviewed every single one of these bands you mentioned. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And the Toadies had the big, fat, fucking, pacist woman.  Yeah!  Some piggy woman.  But she was cool as shit, man.  Remember the Hispanic that called up requesting, uh, So Help Me, Jesus?  So Help Me, Jesus.  You know that song, So Help Me, Jesus?  So Help Me, Jesus.  I thought so.  I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?  I thought someone was setting us up.  I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  She wanted Possum Kingdom.  And we're like, well, sing it.  And it was like, so Help Me, Jesus.  You know that song, Help Me, Jesus? 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Make up your mind.  I was a big fan of the butt trumpets.  Yeah, the butt trumpets.  They had one song called You're Ugly.  You're Ugly.  That our stupid station played probably every two hours.  There's the long version of this and the short version.  What?  But they're both kind of long, but there's the one where they just, the ending is extended  longer.  And we always play the short one.  Isn't this a song about a serial killer?  Because it could lead into our serial killer shit. 
[01:28:30]  I don't know.  It sure sounds like it.  It sounds like there's a dead body.  It's somewhere around the lake and it's being posed.  This one had just a great 90s sound to it.  Yeah.  And Corrosion and Conformity.  I was listening to some COC last night.  I love COC.  I saw COC and Metallica at the garden.  That was awesome, man.  Dude, we were, who was the lead singer?  We were pretty good friends with him.  We used to drink with him all the time.  He came into Boston a lot and we would hang out. 
[01:29:00]  He was a cool dude.  What was his name?  I forgot.  It's been years.  The guy from COC, I call him.  And he was frustrated because I.  Yeah, put in cock, Danny.  Let's see what comes up.  It came up.  I got it.  All right.  I think COC.  I think COC was a band that really should have made it more than they did.  That one album they had was unbelievable.  Albatross, right?  Yeah.  That whole fucking thing.  Pepper Keenan, right?  Yeah.  Oh, Pepper.  Remember Pepper?  He was a cool dude. 
[01:29:30]  Good old Pepper.  What is he doing?  Is COC still around?  I do, dude.  Let's see.  You doubt it?  I bet you they're still around.  2007 to present.  COC on hiatus.  On hiatus.  Ah, shit.  Goodbye.  From when until present?  You know COC?  07.  But they went on hiatus from 2002 to 03 and came back.  Jim, you know COC?  What was their big song?  I haven't thought of them in a long time. 
[01:30:00]  Their big fucking monster alternative rock song.  Oh, it was, uh...  What was the name?  Heal my wounds.  No, no, no, no.  It was, uh...  Race car driving.  Clean my wounds.  Oh, clean my wounds.  Of course.  Ah, live version.  Very good.  Beer rub with Derek.  Give me the studio version of Clean My Wounds.  You want to hear a rocker. 
[01:30:30]  Hang on.  Jimmy, I want to know what you think of this song.  You got to get us to the hook, too, there, Travis.  Clean My Wounds.  This fucking guy, this Pepper, had a great fucking voice.  Yeah, well.  Mad Season, River of Deceit, Pepper Keenan, yeah.  A lot of those songs, God.  All I remember is sitting in that fucking AF studio  and figuring out what our next break is going to be  and throwing shit through the wall.  It's not in the system. 
[01:31:00]  We have the live version, and we have a rejoiner that we cut.  Wow, really?  I'll try it.  I'll get it on YouTube.  Wait, SiriusXM's not playing Clean My Wounds somewhere?  They're crazy.  It might be in Profit, but it's not in Gillette.  Profit.  I really don't have time to look at Profit.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  Oh, no.  Oh, my.  I should have it over here.  All right, let's listen a little.  Unless this is a commercial.  It looks like it might be a commercial.  It's stupid.  All right, here we go.  Fucking listen to this. 
[01:31:30]  Fucking da-da-da-da-da-da.  Yeah, this was pretty good stuff.  The wacky 90s video to go with it.  I know.  Pushing shit through a pipe.  Look at my eyes.  Oh, yeah.  He looks like Jesus. 
[01:32:00]  Watching all Beavis and Bloodhead episodes is the best because you start to remember all  of these songs that you forgot about for 10 years at least.  And fuck like the episodes.  I want to watch them review in the band.  You know, it's funny because I got into this Beavis and Butthead kick a couple summers ago.  And I went out to Best Buy to get the Mike Judge collection.  And they don't have the rights to any of the songs or videos.  So it's just the episodes.  And I was like, fuck this. 
[01:32:30]  I don't want to watch Beavis and Butthead without the videos.  That was the funniest part.  I tried to do the same exact thing.  It's enraging.  I was so mad.  It's fucking enraging.  I couldn't believe I spent like 30 bucks.  I just wanted to return it.  So you can't find that stuff.  It's tough to find.  You can get it.  I love it.  No, I understand that.  I love it.  He just goes, oh.  He just starts singing along.  I go, oh.  Every time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're like seminiferous, two bloody old buttoids. 
[01:33:00]  They have lights on their heads so the poo can find its way out.  That's one of my favorite episodes.  These special effects aren't very special.  Yo, Fontaine.  Fontaine on instant feedback saying, what about Sublime?  Fucking love Sublime.  Goddamn guy had to go and die on us.  Give you some Sublime.  You like Sublime, man?  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Sublime was really fucking good.  All right.  You like that, Jimmy? 
[01:33:30]  There's our music break.  I did, actually.  Yeah, I've heard that before.  Yeah.  Very good.  Kick some ass.  We should do Landslide and just fucking play it.  Yeah, it was all about heroin.  It was nice.  You think there was a little heroin?  You took some musicians that were tired of the hair bands.  You sprinkled liberal amounts of heroin over them.  And you got some great music.  A lot of guys fucking dying.  Yeah, well.  Right after their hit record came out.  Good, because who the fuck would really want to see him now, except for a few that belong  to fan clubs? 
[01:34:00]  They're touring again.  Who?  Oh, I know.  Sublime.  They got sued because they went under the name Sublime.  Who sued them?  Brad, whatever his name is, the lead singer that was dead.  His estate owns the name Sublime.  Oh, okay.  But wouldn't they get money out of that?  Wouldn't that be good?  Why would they fucking sue the guys who fucking were part of the band?  Because they didn't want to mislead the public into thinking that this was dead.  He's dead.  That one thinks it's him.  I'm not yelling at you.  I'm explaining.  Holy shit.  How did it happen?  So they changed their name.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, they had to change their name?  Yeah, they changed their name.  They got a new lead singer.  Well, weren't they going by the dub fucking All-Stars or whatever?  Yeah, that was a completely different band, though.  Like, they would play Sublime songs, but I think they had their own songs.  Yeah, they tried.  And this is just Sublime, you know, with a new lead singer.  I have a tough time when a band moves on with a new singer.  I really do.  But it worked out for ACDC.  Oh, boy, did it.  And it's sort of working out for Alice in Chains.  But then again, Cantrell was a big part of the vocals.  It's not.  It's just not for me.  I tried.  Lane Staley's voice is just, fuck. 
[01:35:00]  Just doesn't fucking work.  Just missed.  I do like that fucking Mad Season song, Wake Up, that you played.  I actually bought that CD.  Fucking A.  I love that song.  It was very good.  That whole album is amazing.  He, uh...  Long gone day...  I gotta do a music show.  Where can I do a music show around this fucking joint?  I'm gonna be doing one.  I'll let you pop in and do one anywhere.  I'm not...  And I wouldn't just stay with lithium.  I would go all over the fucking place.  I'm doing one on the Boneyard.  I don't know where you guys want to do your music shows. 
[01:35:30]  That's your business.  Boneyard.  I need a place where I could go, where I could do everything from lithium to some classic  rock to some fucking...  Even in some of that weird outlaw country that I'm starting to get into.  Shade 45.  Do a live right on Shade 45.  There you go.  Go to Shade...  You call it Gregorio's Grab Bag of fun music.  I need a fucking...  I need a channel that...  Where it would make sense.  Because it's gonna be a grab bag of all sorts of weird stuff.  I remember us guys, we used to do the music...  The musical variety.  Yeah, I liked when you guys did that. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  That was fun.  I don't know if we could do it on our channel.  No, no, no.  I don't think we have a lot of music fans.  I gotta go to one of these music channels.  I gotta figure that out.  Because it's easy.  Just voice track it.  It takes two hours.  And we'll have someone else play the music.  Even that one?  It takes that long?  Maybe less.  Probably fucking 15 minutes.  I could do it in an hour.  Here's your list.  I gotta do that, though.  Um...  You...  Oh, Stabbing Westward.  Save Yourself.  Fucking A.  Oh, yeah.  I got that one on my iPod, man.  That one fucking kicks the ass.  Fucking A.  Remember Stabbing Westward? 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, that song is...  Holy shit.  Yeah.  I remember that was like...  I used to find a whole lot of new music.  Because I think my dad got me a subscription to Blender.  Like, before it was just shitty.  Yeah.  And it always came with a sampler CD of great music.  You get like 15 tracks of new stuff.  It was awesome.  Hey, uh...  This is one of the songs that get me in trouble with my neighbors.  Because you crank it?  When I blast it out back with the speakers out back in the summertime.  It's just such a fucking kick-ass song.  Was there a Nine Inch Nails connection with these guys or no? 
[01:37:00]  I know there was sort of with Filter.  Hmm.  No?  And by the way, a lot of people defending the new Alice in Chains, so...  In general, the fans are digging the new Alice in Chains.  In general.  What do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  You probably like the Journey.  The new Journey, too.  Didn't we do this break already?  Yeah, we did.  I remember.  We do it about once every three months.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's always fun.  Three months.  I think once a week we do this one.  But if we're talking about the same exact band...  I know.  You guys remember Silverchair? 
[01:37:30]  We just got...  We're the worst.  We really do.  Just go, yeah, remember?  I remember playing this.  This kicked ass.  Yeah, this is a cool song, man.  Just waxing fantastic in our fucking twilight years over here.  Well, people are asking...  What the fuck is wrong about this?  People are asking about Jack White, which wasn't...  You know, that came after all this.  And a fucking...  Jack White is pretty much a god.  He's amazing.  Ooh.  I love everything Jack White does.  Almost everything. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, we got salads?  Yeah, it's salad time, my friend.  Can we play Landslide going into break?  That's the one I want to hear by Smashing Pumpkins.  We'll play a little of that.  We'll see how long...  How long is the song, Travis?  Three minutes?  Three and a half?  Yeah, three minutes.  Yeah, let's play that.  All right, hang on.  We're going to eat salads and shit.  And then we'll continue with material next.  Can I just say I'm reading this complaint?  And, like, where this fucking Earl made...  They made...  It's like a motion to dismiss on our court. 
[01:38:30]  And just reading the code, the human rights decision, like...  Blah, blah, quote.  How they're going to allow it to continue, I think, instead of just dismissing it.  I want to fucking smash whoever wrote this.  Yeah.  Fucking dreck.  They just want to be involved.  Yeah, of course.  Fucking asshole.  Human rights commission.  We're going to make a difference.  Helmet, unsung.  Dicks.  And sponge plowed.  Oh, my God.  A couple more.  Tribunal.  Coming up, Nick Cannon's April Fool's prank.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  Is he doing one?  Oh, yeah.  But first...  Oh, nice. 
[01:39:00]  First, a little landslide by Smashing Pumpkins.  And then...  Are we going to do a Steve from Yellowstone phone call today?  Yeah.  We'll do Steve from Yellowstone calls in when the member of Foreigner was on the phone.  Oh, it was...  Oh, God.  What was his name?  Oh, Ellie, I think?  Oh, my God.  Wait, the member of Foreigner?  The lead singer?  The new lead singer?  Oh, it wasn't Lou Graham?  No.  Yeah, Kelly.  Who the fuck's Kelly?  We called it.  I remember that.  It was on XM.  I can't wait.  All right, so that's the setup for the Steve from Yellowstone.  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, we're doing a lot of pranky shit going into break in honor of April Fool's.  April Fool's.  And that weird voice you hear is Travis because the bosses need us to intro every fucking  person that talks on our show for some reason.  Thank you, Opie.  You're welcome, Jim Norton.  What's that, Anthony?  I said I didn't know who that was, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  Someone coughed, Danny.  All right.  Was that you coughing, Danny, who sits over there?  Yes.  Hi, Danny.  Hi.  How are you doing back there, Dracula?  This fucking beast will go. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, here he is.  I'm doing a lot of April Fool's jokes to people.  Uh-oh, let's hear one.  Oh, no.  Are you like the fun guy in the halls today?  I sure am.  What have you done so far, Kenny?  I just tell people your shoe's untied.  He's killing himself over here.  He should be.  All right, let's go.  More of Club Soda Kenny's April Fool's pranks on the way, too.  Teasing everything.  But first this. 
[01:40:30]  Hit it.  Hit it.  I took my love to the town  The cloud about not turning around  And I saw my reflection in a snow  Covered hill to the landslide 
[01:41:00]  Rolling down  A mirror in the sky  What is love?  Can the child in my heart  Rise and blow?  Can I sail through the changing  Ocean's eyes?  Can I handle the seasons  Of my life? 
[01:41:30]  I've been afraid of changing  Cause I've built my life around you  Time makes you older  Even children get older  I'll get older too  I've been afraid of changing 
[01:42:00]  Cause I've built my life around you 
[01:42:30]  Time makes you older  Even children get older  I'm getting older too  I'm getting older too  I'll touch my love  I'll touch my love  And took you down  I'll climb the mountain 
[01:43:00]  I'll turn around  And if you see my reflection  In the snow  Covered hill  The landslide brought it down  The landslide brought it down  The landslide brought it down  The landslide brought it down  We've got a lot of people. 
[01:43:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  We've got a lot of callers that are very excited.  They want to go and see you guys, I guess.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve in Yellowstone.  Hey, Steve.  What the hell? 
[01:44:00]  He's very excited.  Steve, go ahead.  Steve, go ahead.  Hey, Steve.  I didn't think I was going to get through. 
[01:44:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm a little bit nervous.  All right.  Go ahead, Steve.  Loosen your pants a little bit.  Yeah.  Calm down, Steve from Yellowstone.  Let's go.  I'm sorry.  I just feel kind of.  I'm a little bit embarrassed.  I'm actually...  My people in my office are kind of laughing at it because I'm calling a radio show to talk  to somebody.  Yeah.  You're a big Farner fan?  Yes.  I grew up listening to Farner.  I did grow up.  Listening to Farner and you like Lou Graham.  Have you heard Kelly?  Yes.  He sounds just like... 
[01:45:00]  Ramon!  Ramon!  Tell you the girl!  Steve sounds a little preoccupied.  Ramon!  Ooh, grab me a faggot!  All right.  Somebody didn't take their medication this morning. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  Wow.  Ramon!  This guy sucks dicks.  All right, Steve.  Steve.  I think we've had it with you.  Kelly, I'm sorry.  Sometimes we get calls that get through and...  They just want to be silly.  We'll beep that out.  We'll beep that out.  Ramon!  You know that is your crowd, though.  Yeah, unfortunately, that is a few of them.  A few bad apples, as we like to call them.  Wow.  Don't follow me.  Hey, this is a quick thing. 
[01:46:00]  I was just telling Danny, I was driving home from Long Island yesterday, and...  I saw a car, and a lot of people are going to laugh at me, but it's the first time I saw  this particular car. 
[01:46:30]  It's called the Cube.  There it is.  Oh, my God, yeah.  This thing is horrendous.  They're horrible.  It is pretty much a square.  A complete square.  Hispanic people seem to drive a lot of those cars.  You've seen a lot of these cars in?  Yes.  It was the first one I saw.  I'm like, who in their right mind would buy a Cube?  Who makes it?  Nissan.  Nissan?  Nissan, and I can't wait for people's rear windshields to break, because it's got a wrap  around the rear windshield.  It's one piece that goes from, like, the passenger side to the driver's side. 
[01:47:00]  At least it looks like one piece.  Oh, yeah, yeah, like that one.  Maybe it's not one piece.  Yeah, it's a little hatch.  They have one corner, you know, for support.  Oh, that's a door that opens up.  I see.  Yeah, I thought it was like a one piece for something.  It's horrendous, man.  What an ugly little vehicle.  I was behind one of those on 25A as I was going into, I don't know, fucking, I think  I drove through Asia yesterday.  What is up with the Asian neighborhoods where they don't want Whitey to know anything about  the neighborhood?  You know when you go into some communities and it's like, you see the Chinese restaurant, 
[01:47:30]  but you can figure out it's a Chinese restaurant because there's some kind of English, or you  can figure out this is a supermarket because it has some kind of English associated with  the Chinese writing?  Well, you drive through Flushing.  I know I'm going way too local here, and they don't want you to know what any of this  shit is.  It is just hardcore Chinese, Korean, Japanese, whatever, writing.  That's because they want.  With no clue.  It could be a massage parlor or it could be a real estate office.  I don't know.  They only want Asians in there because they only want their daughters going out with the 
[01:48:00]  Asian men.  So they, it keeps the riffraff out so they can keep those bloodlines pure.  Yes.  Oh my.  Oh my.  Oh my.  Yes.  All right, none of that crap.  We got his, is his highness on the line?  Oh, is he?  It's, uh, yeah, it's Thursday.  We got to talk to his highness.  His highness? 
[01:48:30]  Oh my gosh, dude.  What a morning I'm having here.  Hi, Ian Halpert.  How are you, sir?  What's up?  Hey, guys.  It's been a long time, but I'm up in the mountains somewhere and, uh, I'm having the time of my  life.  I have a great guest with me today.  She is, uh, I guess you could call it cheating on her A-list husband, but, uh, she's right  here and, uh, she's licking my balls as I'm talking to you guys today.  That cannot be.  Who is?  Although you've been right and you've proven, we've, you've proven yourself right every 
[01:49:00]  time.  Are you still, are you still, do you still have the tenacity to death me?  No, actually, you know, you probably do have an A-listers chick just licking your balls  right now.  You're right.  Can we say hi to her?  Or I'm going to put her on.  Let me do my spiel first, but this is going to make headlines, you know?  And, uh, oh my gosh, this feels great.  I'm going to have a way to wake up.  But, uh, how are you guys today?  We're doing all right, Ian Halpern.  You know, man.  Hey, uh, you know, we, uh, uh, it just was, uh, reported. 
[01:49:30]  I love when we give you gossip too, which is nice.  We give you.  You guys should, you guys are doing my job.  Yeah.  Uh, I haven't even told people you guys actually write my books for me.  That's wonderful.  I'm going to get my balls licked by A-list.  Rachel, uh, who could tell?  I always say it wrong every fucking time.  It's cute.  All right.  Uh, it came out that she got a $10 million payday from Tiger Woods.  I believe it.  Look, you could tell, I could tell you one thing.  Uh, I think everyone and their uncle's been in her hole in Hollywood. 
[01:50:00]  She has a huge path.  Seriously.  This is one woman who knows how to get around.  I believe she's been married, divorced, uh, cheating on everyone.  And Tiger, he got roped in because, uh, she had the goods on him and, uh, she was going  to write a book.  So it was either put out the book or, uh, shut her up.  And he decided to shut her up.  But Tiger Woods, he's a fool.  Why do you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy and I want to ask the exact same question.  How big is your cock? 
[01:50:30]  Oh.  We're confused because all these, uh, all these broads coming out and, uh, obviously  Tiger pays off Rachel $10 million, assuming that would be the end of it.  And, and none of this, uh, none of this info would come out.  None of these girls would come out.  I mean.  Well, apparently the rumor mill is, uh, he gave her a sexually transmitted disease and  that's why he's shutting her up.  Wow.  That's what the rumor mill.  No one else has come up with that, but that's why, you know, you got to pay when you pay.  There's more fuel to the fire that, you know, there's a lot in there that we don't know 
[01:51:00]  about, but that's what I've heard through my sources.  And also she wanted to pen this book.  She has positioned herself much better than all those other skanks that Woods been with.  And she had the power to write a tell all about Tiger.  Fortunately, she's not.  So, you know, after my next book comes out, I'll be back on the Tiger Woods trail.  I was offered almost a million beans several months ago to write a book about Tiger, but  I'm under contract for another project right now.  So once this one's over, I might be back, uh, you know, on the golf course with Tiger. 
[01:51:30]  All right, uh, I got to slow you down a little bit.  So 10 million, because, uh, the rumor is that she got a, uh, uh, STD from Tiger.  What, what does the rumor say it was?  Does the rumor say it was a Herb?  I, I wouldn't want to say that because I don't want to get sued, you know, I, I, until  I confirm it, until I see this.  Okay.  So we keep it as a, as a rumor on this one.  But my sources say there was a sexually transmitted disease.  She was going to come out with it.  And look, you know.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, Ian. 
[01:52:00]  Because we want to have a conversation instead of, uh, a soliloquy from you today.  Good word.  Uh, thank you.  Was that a good word?  Phenomenal.  Okay, thank you.  Holy shit, man.  Uh, hold on.  So Rachel gets 10 million and the Perkins went, see.  She's licking my crack on the O&A show right now.  He probably can't hear it.  Holy smokes.  This feels amazing.  I feel fantastic today.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, what a way to wake up.  All right.  Yes, gentlemen.  So what, um, what exactly did she have on him that other people did besides this rumor? 
[01:52:30]  Or what did she allegedly have on him?  Well, all the emails.  I believe the sex tape, which I've said all along, exists.  And, uh, the sexually transmitted disease.  And he, he just can risk that coming out.  She wanted to crash a book, uh, right before his comeback.  And, uh, and, you know, he had to shut her up.  And the only way to shut her up, it wasn't by banging her again.  It was by, uh, either knocking her off, paying a hitman to kill her, or at the payroll.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:53:00]  And, uh, all the other women have got to be completely jealous that she got a $10 million  payday.  I sent an email to my source and Tiger Woods cam said, look, you don't have to pay her  $10 million.  Pay Norton $150.  Norton.  Norton.  How great is it that the Perkins waitress got nothing and she had to talk about how Tiger  asked her to pull out a tampon so he could have sex with her.  Am I a ghost with this fucking guy?  He's in demand, selling out everywhere.  When are you coming up to Canada, man?  For the Montreal Festival. 
[01:53:30]  You're going to be there this summer?  Yes, I am.  Awesome.  I'm going to be there too.  Could you get me a free ticket or I have to pay?  You can, you can come.  I'll be happy to.  This is so much better than what I was trying to get at, by the way.  I'm going to take you up to Schwartz's on Taylor Street, the world's famous smoking.  They just can't hear.  I think, I think they call it.  Can you hear us?  I can hear you a bit, man.  I'm getting my crack licked right now by an A-lister's wife.  Wife, girlfriend.  Who is it?  A-lister's mother. 
[01:54:00]  Take a guess.  Let's see if you guys can guess.  I don't feel like playing.  An A-lister, oh, I'd love to.  An A-lister's wife.  Let's see.  Is it George Bush, Sr.  Now she's sucking my big toe.  We're all up in the mountains together.  Is her name Katie?  Wow.  You know, I know Katie very well, by the way.  I've sat next to her on planes.  Oh, my gosh.  That's not, that doesn't mean you know her well. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah?  No, I do not.  That means you had really good luck that day when you booked your flight.  She's looking my big toe.  Yeah, that means you got upgraded.  Yeah, really.  Upgraded from your shitty coat seat.  Life is good today.  Yeah, is it?  Driving me fucking nuts.  Ian, what else you got?  All right, well, since it's Passover, I'm calling on Hollywood to do another remake.  You know, they're remaking every TV show.  I know Hawaii Five-0's coming back.  Every movie they've seen because there's no creativity anymore. 
[01:55:00]  They don't know how to create anything new.  You know, the easy cop-out is by doing the remake.  So I'm calling since it's Passover to all my Jewish friends.  Let, oh, shit, this feels good.  Let's remake the Ten Commandments.  And I want to know who Norton would cast as the lead in Moses.  For Moses.  I don't know.  Ten Commandments.  Who would I cast as Moses?  Rich Voss.  Oh, God. 
[01:55:30]  I say Will Ferrell.  Dozes.  You can't even say Commandments.  I give to you these Ten Commandments.  Yes.  These Ten Condiments.  Ten laws.  They're on tablets.  I am going to be coming on the O&A show today.  She's reaching a climax with me.  Can we hear her voice so we know that you're not just rubbing your balls with your own spittle? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Have a go.  Dude, listen.  I don't want you guys doubting me anymore.  You're getting ridiculous.  We're not doubting.  We just want to hear her voice a little bit.  I'm going to put her on, but she wants me to ejaculate before I put her on.  All right.  Why don't you do that, Ian?  Holy shit, man.  Oh.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, my.  I want to put Simon Cowell as Ramses. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah.  Dita Von Teese as Nefertiri.  Oh, this feels good.  The Rock as Joshua.  Oh, wow.  And Anthony Kuma as Sephora.  Kuma.  Whoever that is.  But, okay.  I think the cast is complete.  Oh, do you, um.  Where's Steve Carlesi today?  He just spoke. 
[01:57:00]  Holy smokes.  I'm going to do it today, guys.  Holy shit.  Oh, Jimmy.  There's no swing to it.  It's just noise.  I hope you guys don't find this impolite.  Yeah?  No, I just find it repulsive.  Exactly.  You're sucking your fat Canadian hog.  You know Ian's got a fat one.  You caught me in a bad moment today.  Let's keep going on with the news.  She can't make me come yet.  I will just do it.  All right.  What about Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston? 
[01:57:30]  Dude, that's like the WWF, that couple.  You know, it's, come on.  It's all prearranged by their publicists.  And I predict if it goes any further, my sources say he's the next guy after James.  And by the way, Tiger Woods is breathing a big sigh of relief about Jesse James.  He's smoking champagne that this guy came out.  But I think the next guy is Gerard Butler.  He's been in about everything, 16 and up in Hollywood.  And I know that I've been in LA a lot lately. 
[01:58:00]  And he's the next sex-addicted lying beast to be outed.  Did you hear he checked in?  Didn't he check into a place already?  Yeah, I'm a bullshit, phony, fucking shanker.  Yeah, I agree.  Yeah.  I want to start, oh, shit.  Okay, I want to start a regular feature on your show called His Highness Blind.  Okay.  And each week featuring a new blind item.  And my blind item this week is a...  The governor of New York. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, sorry.  We didn't hear you because we were, like, laughing and making jokes, Ian.  All right.  So you've got to kind of listen a little better.  It would be really good for everybody involved.  One of them is a top TV host has been cheating on his wife with an actress at least 20 years younger than him.  A top TV host has been cheating on his actress wife.  Actress wife?  With a woman who's...  On his wife.  Oh, I'm sorry.  With an actress who's 20 years younger.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Who's a host?  Interesting.  I'm not going to speculate.  Any speculation?  Wait, wait.  Now, a host cheating with someone 20 years younger.  I'm just trying to think of a host who's 25.  I couldn't say that.  Yeah, right?  Well, I don't know if we want to guess.  Has this host had indiscretions?  Hold on.  Hold on one second.  Hey, you're going too hard, man.  Just lighten up.  Going too hard, man?  Man. 
[01:59:30]  Of course, man.  Yes.  Come on.  All right.  Just soft.  Be gentle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry about that, guys.  Jesus.  Has this host had indiscretions in the past?  Right.  No.  Does his name rhyme with Fetterman?  I've got to keep it blind.  Again, you know, I don't want to get us all sued because I know you guys don't have a pot  to piss and I'm going to have to pay all the legal fees.  That's true. 
[02:00:00]  All right.  Say that again.  We've got it here.  Oh, shit.  Man.  Do you think this is dangerous, what I'm doing here?  I mean, this woman's not going to be bad.  Jerking off in bed.  Exactly.  No, it's not at all.  We're still going there.  We haven't heard her, though.  All right, hold on, hold on.  We got WWTDD checking in.  Brendan from WhatWouldTylerDurtonDo.com, you're on with Ian Halpern.  Halpern, please shut the fuck up. 
[02:00:30]  You're an ass, and your fucking scoops are shit that have been in the news for months.  Type in Uchitel and STD.  You get over 100,000 hits, you jackass.  All right, listen to me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me, girlfriend.  Girlfriend, listen.  What are you doing today?  I'm doing my crack lick by an A-list actress, okay, who's actually married.  Only his highness could pull this off.  And where are you going to work today?  What are you doing with your life? 
[02:01:00]  You guys fantasizing about mine.  Have a good day.  Dude, hey, dickhead, I get 50 million hits a month.  How many do you fucking get?  You get 50 million hits by a bunch of gay, gay, white Americans.  Listen.  Yeah?  You'd like to dance the way his highness dances right now.  I'm getting my crack lick.  Are you getting your crack lick right now?  Jesus.  You'd love to know that, wouldn't you?  You fucking homo. 
[02:01:30]  Good comeback.  Good comeback.  It kind of was.  Yeah, it was actually.  You'll never, let alone, you will never even open up for Jim Norton.  You'll never even be able to tie his shoelaces.  Why the fuck would I want to?  Exactly.  I wear laceless loafers anyway.  Yeah, that's strike two right there.  Yeah.  Come on.  Oh, it's wrong.  Angela.  Come on.  Give me a female caller today, please. 
[02:02:00]  Just one female.  These guys are all homoerotic.  This is.  No, you don't understand.  This is the guy that runs.  What would Tyler Durden do with the website?  Yeah, he does pretty well.  All that he does is sit home and Google me all day.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, that's all he does.  What about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie?  You said what?  Have you read my book?  Girlfriend, have you read my book?  No, no one's read your fucking book.  Oh, yeah?  Really? 
[02:02:30]  I think the last time I heard, over 900,000 people around the world have read it.  Because I got a big check recently.  That's why I have this actress here licking my crack.  Wait, which book?  Dickhead, Brangelina?  Yeah.  The one with 32 customer reviews for two stars?  You know, there's people like, look, all those people who are writing bad comments, they're  the people first in line at the bookstores.  You know, I love all those people.  But, you know, when a heavyweight journalist comes out with the great reviews, that's all 
[02:03:00]  that counts to me.  Because I know I have my haters out there.  See, there's no middle ground with his highness.  You either love them or you hate them.  But the fact is, the ones who love me are licking my crack today.  Look, that's good for him.  But no one else.  Dude, when was the last time someone licked your crack?  Brandon?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I missed it.  He asked you a question.  What was the question? 
[02:03:30]  He wants to know the last time you had your ass licked.  Apparently that's important to him.  Yeah, I know.  He's obsessed with my ass.  Let's put on a female caller here.  This guy, all he's doing is fantasizing about my experience this morning.  Don't answer any questions.  You said Brad and Angelina were getting divorced, what, two months ago?  Why hasn't that happened?  First of all, douchebag, they're not even married, okay?  There's no marriage there.  I said they're going to split within 12 to 18 months.  I said it exclusively December something on the O&A show. 
[02:04:00]  Norton was there.  And we still have time to take a pill, chill out,  and fantasize about his highness getting his crack licked today.  His highness.  18 months.  That's your idea of a fucking prediction?  Yeah, 18 months.  That's the time, you know, two kids.  A woman could have two kids.  You know, I know Anthony.  He's expecting.  Why would it keep him?  No, I'm not. 
[02:04:30]  Anthony, do you want me in the – sorry, Opie,  do you want me in the delivery room next month with you?  Because I've had the experience.  Well, I mean, I need someone that can focus on what's going on  instead of getting their ass licked while, you know, someone's giving birth.  Do you want me to play my sax while your beautiful one is delivering?  So we'll bring the baby.  We actually would love to hear you play the sax as you're getting your ass licked right now.  That would be amazing radio.  I have a plane to catch, and I hate to break it to you.  I'm going to have to go to the airport in a wheelchair because this is wild. 
[02:05:00]  Brendan, anything else for Ian before he lets you go?  No, because he doesn't answer any questions.  Ian, can you at least –  Hey, Brendan, listen.  Hold on, hold on.  Ian, let him ask you.  Let him ask you.  It's Passover.  Be good to me, dude.  That's fair.  Let Brendan ask one last question.  Let Brendan ask.  I don't have to call you an anti-Semite today, Brendan.  Let Brendan ask one more question.  Yeah, we like Brendan.  Let him ask you a question.  We do like him, actually.  You guys should get along.  Why would it take 18 months for them to get divorced?  Listen, dude, I've been in the camp.  I know Angie and Brad better than they know themselves, and everyone close to them knows 
[02:05:30]  that.  They admit that.  Everything takes time.  Why would it take six months for Jackson to die to the day I said he'd die?  You know, because I do my research, dude.  That's why I'm on top.  Who are you?  50 million hits a day just Googling me.  Dickhead, you said he would die within a year, not six months.  No, I said, dude, you have no idea.  Get rid of this douche.  Seriously, he's saying false things.  I don't want to get my lawyers to sue him for defamation today. 
[02:06:00]  I have no time for this.  I'm calling you homo, too.  Call me whatever you want.  Call me whatever you want.  You know, call me.  You're just anti-Jewish, dude.  You're just jealous of black and Jews.  Wait, wait, wait.  We have the schlongs.  We don't.  Ian, you can prove him wrong.  If we hear a female voice, then the homo thing doesn't have much weight.  That's right.  We'll run shortly, man.  She's just licking away.  That's why I'm very...  Well, let's hear the licking sounds.  I'm edge. 
[02:06:30]  I'm trying to put it to there, but holy shit, this feels good.  All right.  All right, Brennan.  We're going to let you go.  Talk to you soon, man.  Thank you, Brennan, from whatwithtylardurndu.com.  Let's go to Jennifer in Chicago.  Big fan of yours, Your Highness.  I love Jennifer.  Jennifer.  I love your name, Jennifer.  Hello?  Hi, Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.  How are you doing?  Hi, Ian.  How are you?  Hey, I want to send you all my love, peace, a Passover, peace at Easter, and why in the  land of plenty does the joy of Passover and Easter escape many? 
[02:07:00]  Hey, oh, oh.  Yes!  Yes, I'm a big fan.  Yes!  Yes!  You sound like Mad Dog Vashon, the old wrestler.  You know, have you ever heard...  Oh, Jennifer, I got to go.  I got to go, guys.  This is...  Yes!  You got to go.  Check out the...  I got to go.  I got to go.  I got to go.  I really don't want to come on the air because I'm a Koh-Ain Jew, and I don't want this to  be bad luck for me. 
[02:07:30]  I got to go, guys.  Where are you going?  Hey, wait.  You can't go, Ian.  I love you all.  I love you all.  Oh, Ian.  Oh, well, there he goes.  There he goes.  He didn't want to come on the air.  Of course, an A-lister's wife is licking his ass crack on April Fool's Day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that was fucking funny.  Yeah, and I'm calling you a holler.  And I'm calling you.  I don't want to have to sue you.  He goes, yeah, well.  Go ahead.  I'm calling you a homo, too.  Brendan just gave us a great call, and he doesn't like being on the radio. 
[02:08:00]  I know.  He's fucking fantastic.  He's getting pretty comfortable.  He killed him.  Yeah.  He fucking killed him.  Want to do another quick break, or do you want to keep going?  Don't matter to me?  I would mind chatting a little bit more.  Doesn't matter to me?  Well, we should bring Sam in, because we've got the Nick Cannon.  Oh, the April Fool's thing.  Nick Cannon is shocking the world today, Anthony.  Let's go.  Shocking the world.  I cannot wait to hear this, because, you know, this is Nick's first April Fool's as  a radio personality.  And he's got a talent coach, yes.  He's got a talent coach, as we know, because his show's just amazing. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, it's just terrific.  And apparently, what's the deal?  He's running with this one?  With April Fool's?  Yeah.  Is it a joke, or is it real?  Well, this one, it turned out to be a prank.  Oh, wow.  What?  But you probably weren't able to tell, right?  No, he got, I'll say this, he got me.  Oh, shit, Sam.  He did.  So you got the April Fool's prank in front of us here? 
[02:09:00]  The real hard part about it was, I listened for like an hour, hour and a half.  Stop, sorry.  Steve from Bayshore.  I can't say it, but it's some play on words with the month of April.  Month of April?  Yes, it's coming.  Oh, I can't, I bet I know it.  April Fool's.  Is there a hyphen in it?  Yeah, I think he put a hyphen in there somewhere. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  April.  No, but the tough part about trying to figure it out was that at first I didn't know what the prank was.  Because when he wasn't doing the April Fool's stuff, he was doing stuff that sounded like this has to be an April Fool's joke.  Really?  Like the one, today's promotion is trying to get people to call up and at noon they're going to go to Coney Island for free. 
[02:10:00]  Wow.  But he had to keep saying this is not an April Fool's joke.  We're going to Coney Island.  So it's a real thing?  That's real.  That's not the prank.  Oh, okay.  And then the other thing he's promoting today is the Bieber Bunny.  What the fuck is the Bieber Bunny?  No, Bieber Bunny.  Bieber.  Oh, Bieber.  Justin Bieber.  Well, it's where, since it's Easter, is right around the corner, Justin Bieber concert tickets that are sold out were put in Easter eggs, and the Bieber Bunny hid them throughout New York City, and he gives hints as to where the Bieber Bunny might have hidden the eggs. 
[02:10:30]  Is that real?  Yeah.  That's not the prank as well.  You can say, I thought scavenger hunts were illegal.  No.  Not the Bieber Bunny.  Oh, that sounds cute.  The Bieber Bunny.  Yeah.  And that's not the prank.  No.  But we got the prank in front of us.  This is the prank.  It's a ripoff of Jungle. 
[02:11:00]  Well, Nick Cannon shocks the world, Anthony.  Here he goes, shocking the world.  All right, let's hear it.  And when we come back, I'm going to get into that exclusive, never heard before, new Justin Bieber smash.  I know everybody's probably tripping.  Probably, I'm getting calls from the record label, like, what song are you going to play?  Don't even worry about it.  It's real big.  Justin Bieber smash coming up right here on Newt 92.3 now. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, okay.  So now people are going to freak out.  That's one of the benefits to having a celebrity host your morning show, that they have access to never before heard Justin Bieber music.  And believe me, what is his album debut at number one?  Yeah.  So this is big.  The kids love Justin Bieber.  Oh, who doesn't?  You ever see the girl crying over Justin Bieber?  Sure.  It's just, oh, Uncle Paul.  That ain't why she was crying.  I bet. 
[02:12:00]  Justin.  All right.  It is time.  You're rolling with Nick Cannon.  Hour later.  One hour later.  And this is, this is, this song I'm playing underneath here, that's, that's Justin Bieber, right?  That's the, his first single, one time.  And I've known young Bieber since before he dropped his first single.  Since, you know, when he first got on, shots out to my man Scooter, shots out to Usher. 
[02:12:30]  The young man is very talented.  So they signed him.  And then, you know, he, it was a bidding war between, you know, Usher and Justin Timberlake.  And, you know, we, we kind of, we all cool.  So I heard about this young kid and I've had the opportunity to work with him.  Right.  I actually have a record that Justin Bieber did that no one has ever heard before.  Exclusive.  Wow.  That I'm about to get into right now.  And this record is massive.  This record is like, I'm telling you, 
[02:13:00]  Lil' John is, is on it.  What?  Gucci Man is on it.  Gucci Man?  Gucci Man.  Justin Bieber and Gucci Man, what?  Gucci.  Lil' John on the track?  That's crazy.  DJ Drama, like, gave his seal of approval.  Like, y'all don't know, Justin Bieber is gangster.  Wait, so if Justin Bieber is so big, Sam, why doesn't every station have this song?  Why does Nick, why only Nick?  Why?  Because he's such a big star.  Yeah.  That he knows the Bieber.  He just called up Usher. 
[02:13:30]  But why would that be good for the Bieber?  He just called up.  When he could give this record to everybody.  No.  What?  Because of an exclusive.  Explain, Sam.  Explain.  It's an exclusive.  He's just like, hey, what's up, Usher?  It's me, Nick Cannon.  Do you think I could maybe have the single on my radio show first?  So him playing a new Justin Bieber song would be huge, I guess?  Well, yeah.  And also, Justin Bieber came out with his album just now.  And so to have a never-before-heard Justin Bieber song would imply it's not on the album  that he just released. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  Yeah.  It's a big song, but not on the album.  It just came out.  Yeah.  It's like a huge thing.  But other people are on it.  Why would it be on the album if it's so good that he had to leave it off the album?  Yeah.  He actually, I think in the next clip-  This is fucking horse shit.  He says it's because it's so gangster that they didn't want Justin Bieber, because Justin  Bieber-  He's got an image.  But he's so gangster that they didn't want the girls to find out.  What?  Girls like that? 
[02:14:30]  Yes.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  Jimmy's-  He'll tell us in a minute.  Jimmy just started cracking up looking at his phone.  I never have this.  Somebody just-  I've never met Tony Romo from the Dallas Cowboys, but somebody just sent me a Twitter.  Puddle of AIDS sent one that said, pick of Jim Norton meeting his idol, Dallas quarterback 
[02:15:00]  Tony Romo.  And you can look under my Twitter, at Jim Norton.  And, uh, it just-  It's just-  It's opening.  Harry, quickly!  Oh my God.  It fucking looks like me.  It's a young, it's a young little- 
[02:15:30]  Oh, that's the greatest thing I've ever seen.  It's a young little child with Down syndrome.  Yeah.  It's just opening up-  That looks just like Jim P.  It's sitting on-  Oh, being an Anthony star.  Jim Norton is a huge Dallas Cowboys fan.  And the comedian has always dreamt about meeting his idol, Tony Romo.  The Make-A-Wish Foundation is trying to make a chinless jokester's wish of reality.  They arrange a special meeting for little Jimmy and the quarterback in the meatpacking district 
[02:16:00]  of New York City.  Oh, this is very funny.  Holy-  When asked about the encounter and his role model, Jimmy had this to say.  Yay, pudding.  And it's a picture of Romo with, uh, someone who he feels looks like me.  Dude.  Oh, is that fucking-  That picture is fucking hysterical.  I'm gonna laugh all day about that.  Jesus. 
[02:16:30]  Jim Norton.  What-  Uh, what is that on?  Is that just Twitter?  Yeah, if you go to Twitter, at Jim Norton,  it's Puddle of Ages.  I'm trying to, uh-  Oh my God, is that fucking funny, man.  Oh, good gravy.  That's fucking hilarious.  Jesus Christ.  You look very confused in that picture, Jimmy.  Did you just have some paint chips?  I don't know.  Or is your throat full of pennies?  I don't know what happened.  But I can tell you one thing.  I'm not thinking anything smart or poignant.  Holy shit. 
[02:17:00]  Holy, holy Toledo.  Am I gonna laugh all day at that photo?  Poor kid.  We're stunned.  He knows what's happening.  Holy shit.  Tony Romo's smiling.  what he throws  is smarter than that  oh no  the hat is all side 
[02:17:30]  why wouldn't it be straight  a little sweater vest  what's that for  it's so horrible  it's probably so he doesn't pick at the buttons and eat them  oh fuck  gotta cover up those shiny buttons  they look delicious  put a sweater vest over the buttons  so they don't wind up in a stool  three hours  oh my 
[02:18:00]  oh god that is a good one  god puddle evades  bravo  gave us a good fucking laugh in here  I just retweeted it  also on tedwilliamshead.com  his website  tedwilliamshead.com  that's a fucking great site  what an asshole  puddle of evades  you really are a piece of shit  that's fantastic 
[02:18:30]  now the Nick Cannon thing doesn't really mean  fucking shit  no I gotta hear it  I wanna know  so then  Nick finally plays the new Justin Bieber  jam after like fucking promoting it  all morning  as a big fucking deal for everybody  it's a new song  which would get everyone buzzing about  his show  and whatever  so  exclusive  yeah  Justin Bieber  it's the first time  it's the first time it's ever been heard  and the only reason why  cause  cause IDJ thought this  it was two gangsters to put out  they didn't wanna 
[02:19:00]  they didn't wanna tarnish his image  here we go  Justin Bieber featuring Gucci Man  and Lil Jon  exclusively right here on  New York's new  92-92-3  now  let's get into it  Bieber  what is this  now  it's in your store right  yeah  oh that's not Justin 
[02:19:30]  that's not  I know it's your  Lil Jon of Gucci  drops out of  other songs  I thought I'd have to hear  that goddamn song again  gangsta breezy  shit  yeah  yeah  huh  gangsta breezy  yeah  yeah 
[02:20:00]  keep it going  yeah  yeah  it's still going  gangsta breezy  it's official  it's never been heard before  it's how we do  New York's new  92-3 now  Bieber  fish don't need shoes  he said it's a fish shoe  they do need vests though  well yes  what does that mean  a fish shoe  no it's like  he said it's a fish shoe 
[02:20:30]  it's official  except he said  I didn't hear that  I said it's  I heard it's a fish shoe  it's more  like casual  it's official  but  where's the joke  yeah what's the  well you see  everybody was just  turned into their radios  everyone feels like  they were just had  because an hour ago  he said  he's going to play  the Justin Bieber song  and then  finally he plays it  and  I thought the April Fool's joke  was that he has a fish  that wears a shoe  maybe  I mean Danny just pulled out  it's a fish shoe 
[02:21:00]  oh it's a fish in a shoe  I've seen those  the big platform shoes  but it's a goldfish  alright so that's what  he was talking  that's funny then  that's the April Fool's joke  it's a fish shoe  again no no no  he's not calling  Justin Bieber a fish shoe  I don't know  what sense that would make  he said official  oh he did  I didn't hear that  the joke was the song itself  that would entail  adding an L  into the word  right  I mean it did  I didn't hear that  no the joke  was the song  oh it certainly was  does he wrap up  this horrible bit  it was a fucking joke 
[02:21:30]  well luckily  he takes a phone call  to kind of  you know  boost himself up  from his wife  no from a listener  no  it's Michelle Nicole  hey what's up  nothing much  we just heard  the new song  you heard the new Bieber  it was hot right  it was amazing  we stayed up an hour  just to hear that  sorry  it's okay 
[02:22:00]  it was really funny  though  it was amazing  alright  April Fool's  the kid's fucking nine  April Fool's  92.3 now  can't even hit the post  it's been months  he still can't hit the post  the kid was nine years old  just fucking  that's embarrassing  you think so  that's really bad  oh my god yeah  that was just April Fool's  did you notice that it wasn't  a real Justin Bieber song  I could care less  first of all  I wouldn't  even know  it's better than Justin Bieber  secondly  the fact that he's gotta do 
[02:22:30]  an April Fool's joke  based on Justin Bieber  and there's so many people  that are Bieber fans  that listen to his show  that that would work  is embarrassing  and the fact that  they let us go for that  I was reading  the talent coach's website  if you guys need a bit  for today  I don't know  how much stuff  you guys have left  but you know  Kim Kardashian  and Reggie Bush  have called it  Splitsville  they've broken up  Splitsville  right  and so we could  is that Kim Kardashian's  crotch 
[02:23:00]  he calls it Splitsville  no  no  it's called  West Shore Expressway  but  we can have  listeners call up  and tell their  breakup stories  and then see who  well that was  the talent coach  is something from  ah  from the talent coach  that's a good idea  people are being  people are paying this guy  for advice like that  radio guys can't figure out  if there's a big breakup  in Hollywood  that they  can go to the phones 
[02:23:30]  and get breakup stories  you have to assume  that the talent coach  the producer  and Nick Cannon  all sat in a room together  yesterday  scratching their heads  about how are we really  going to pull the wool  over everybody's eyes  tomorrow  what can we do  something with Bieber  it's his first April Fool's Day  on radio  so he's got to make it count  this Nick Cannon  knows a lot of guys  in music right  oh yeah  so why doesn't he  get a few of his pals  together to fucking  do a quick little  Justin Bieber song  in a fucking  production studio  somewhere  no no no  and go all in  with this whole thing 
[02:24:00]  no  why not  he did the  he used drops  from other songs  in the Cars for Kids  commercial  yeah  and he was cracking  himself up  he thought  he thought he had  a good one there  oh he did  and he considers himself  a comedian  he's his biggest fan  he really is  well I consider myself  a rocket scientist  I don't think that's  what I can consider myself  I don't think that's what Sam  that's not fair to people  who are rocket scientists  I can consider myself  whatever the fuck I want  one of those rockets  what do you consider yourself  Anthony  pump it up  I want to be an architect 
[02:24:30]  well consider yourself  an architect  you are my friend  discredits architect  I got an announcement guys  yeah  I'm not going to be  on the radio show  no more  because I got my  pilot's license  so I can be flying  for the airlines  oh no you're not  that's April 4th  oh you got me  I thought he was  sleeping  I'm going to go to break  with another Steve  from Yellowstone  phone call  oh  Mistress Roxanne 
[02:25:00]  I don't remember this one  Mistress Roxanne  oh yeah  I forget  oh I'm talking to  our virgin intern  okay  who was it  David  remember  wasn't there a kid  from Detroit  was he a virgin  yeah it was Adam  oh yeah Adam  the liar  oh Adam  remember him  holy shit  it's so hard to get  fired from an internship  here  he did  he did  he managed  I forgot all about him  thanks Sam  that Nick Cannon  horse shit  it never gets old  don't thank me  thank Nick Cannon  yeah thanks Nick  you stupid fuck  here's a seat  from Yellowstone  call as we go to break 
[02:25:30]  I haven't seen  interest like this  in quite some time  now  yeah the phones  are lit  they certainly are  Anthony  let's say hi  to which one  do you want  to go to  probably Steve  I guess  let's go to Steve  from Yellowstone  Steve what's going on  hello  hi how are you  Steve  hello mistress  how are you  I'm a little shy  I kind of want  to be like  mummified  while I scroll  scroll scroll  I just wanted  to be mummified  somehow  because basically  that's how productive 
[02:26:00]  I am at work  so I figured  I might as well  at least be  hello  yes  I'm sorry  I'm just  I'm a little bit shy  a little nervous  there Steve  I'm kind of looking  at myself in the mirror  with tattoos  how do you feel  about mummification  you wouldn't start out  with complete mummification  right away  you'd have to start out  first with breath play  I have had  a great wedding  in Florida  I'd like to 
[02:26:30]  spank this woman  with a tractor trailer  I only  I only  do this  no  I'm alone  this woman  satisfies  my  boring  fetish  alright  let's  say hi  to Paul  hello  hi  how are you  I have to  take issue  with you 
[02:27:00]  saying  that the  age  play  isn't proper  because  I've been  involved  in many  scenarios  where the  age  play  was used  how could  you say  that's  against  the law  I think  that's  no no no  because  you know  go ahead  you talk  I was just  finishing up  it's all  about you  I know  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  it's okay  I'm just  a caller  what do I  know  I have  the agency  and I  didn't take  my medicine  yet  you're too 
[02:27:30]  much  Ramon  this fat  bitch  should be  attacking  Roy Scheider  in a boat  Ramon  the Clintons  should be  pimping this  blimp out  to SeaWorld  Ramon  if she 
[02:28:00]  won a Grammy  her name  would be  Herbie  Fatback  boxer  sir  he 
[02:28:30]  has  said  he  had  con  he  had  his  his  the  his  his  Breathe in, breathe out.  Opie and Anthony, what's going on?  Hey, we got to talk about this serial killer.  Holy shit.  Rodney.  Alan Rippey.  Alcala?  He finally lost it.  Is that his name?  I'm going back quite a ways there.  A little bit, a little bit.  Rodney Alcala is a fucking naughty, naughty boy. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  He's a real piece of shit.  We should get the story out, I guess.  We got a new story.  What does this guy like to do?  Just fuck.  He would choke them and then revive them and then kill them.  That was his thing?  He finally got sentenced.  The third try.  He had been convicted twice of, I guess, raping and murdering a 12-year-old girl.  And they were overturned.  But he has now been convicted.  And he's been convicted and given the death penalty.  They found in a storage locker, I think in Seattle, 100 photographs. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, only 100.  Yeah, over 100 of identified women and girls because the cops fear that they may be a victim.  And there were victims of him.  Over 100 unidentified women and girls.  He was into photography, obviously.  And he would sometimes go, hey, let me take your picture.  And the woman.  Oh, nice.  What a guy.  And other times he has a lot of creepy shots of women not knowing they were getting their pictures taken and stuff.  Wow. 
[02:30:00]  And they're starting to say that some of these pictures, there's victims in there.  Yeah.  They're thinking anyway.  Do you know?  So they're trying to figure out all these pictures and if they're still alive, you know, what the story is.  Yeah.  So they're putting a lot of the pictures online so families can go, holy shit, that's Mary.  She's been missing since 19, blah, blah, blah.  How many did he kill officially?  I think.  I mean, well.  Convicted, you mean.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're saying there's four listed. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know if they're convicted.  Four L.A. women.  That's baby shit alongside what this dude's been doing.  Knocking over mailboxes, keeping 12-year-old girl earrings, going on a dating game.  That's baby shit.  I was listening to Outlaw Country.  They did the communism line.  Oh, they did plain old-fashioned communism.  Let me think.  He's.  I don't know if he was convicted.  Well, let's get the news story and see.  Oh, he was convicted of all four.  Just four.  I have to dye my hair. 
[02:31:00]  Someone said he looks like Stugger Patty.  A little bit.  A little Stugger Patty.  Weird Al.  Weird Al is a murderer, yeah.  Let's get the news story out.  I think Jimmy did a really good job, but there's probably a couple little things in here.  That we might have missed.  It's hard to imagine that this 66-year-old disheveled-looking man.  We, the jury, find the defendant, Rodney James Alcala, guilty.  Maybe one of the most prolific and terrifying serial killers ever brought to justice.  This could be another, easily be another Ted Bundy.  You know, it could be 20, 30 victims. 
[02:31:30]  Rodney Alcala is now on death row for the murder of these five women.  But what has so alarmed investigators are thousands of other pictures, found in his secret locker, just released by police.  Don't some of the pictures turn your stomach?  Every one of them do, because to me, every one of them is a potential another victim.  Some of the potential victims are posed, while others are clearly unaware they're being photographed.  And what the jury learned about the actual victims was horrific.  Before Rodney Alcala, a beautiful young woman. 
[02:32:00]  After Rodney Alcala, she's a brutalized, ripped-up corpse.  Yeah, they kind of showed, like, the crime scene photo.  Wow, really?  I mean, a lot of stuff blurred out.  But you're like, oh, boy.  He really tore him up pretty bad.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Scott in Cleveland.  Scott has a problem here.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, I want to know how Jimmy goes from Uncle Paul to not being so fucking sensitive about this TV report. 
[02:32:30]  How am I sensitive about it?  Well, no, you should be in a jail cell with a 30-year-old woman for the rest of your life.  Punch it out, boys.  Too late.  Yeah, don't give a victory punch it out after that fucking monumental dud.  By the way, he won the dating game.  Yeah, no, we're getting into that.  Oh, yeah.  I got it all figured out here.  We got audio from the dating game.  That's what makes it creepy.  He never went on the date.  She never went out with him because she said she canceled because she found him too creepy. 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  Okay.  That's perceptive.  Here's part two of the story.  Prosecutors say when he was young, Alcala was a master manipulator.  It's the dating game.  Alcala became bachelor number one on the hit show The Dating Game.  Even though he had a rap sheet showing a conviction for brutally beating an eight-year-old girl.  He won the date with the bachelorette and continued taking more snapshots.  Walk up to, you know, camera in hand, polished demeanor. 
[02:33:30]  You walk up and say, you know, you want to be in pictures?  Now those 30-year-old pictures are on the Internet, and hundreds of new tips are coming in.  Researching these old photos is painstaking work.  These people have suffered for decades, so it's nothing for us to commit our time to bring some type of justice  and some type of lead and investigation and maybe some knowledge of what took place,  why somebody's been missing for all these years.  No, I mean, there's thousands of photos.  Obviously, there's not going to be thousands of victims coming from these photos, 
[02:34:00]  so this is a real pain in the ass for the detectives to try to figure this out, right?  Some of them he's just taking pictures.  And some he probably...  Kristen Dunst.  Some that he probably, you know, struck up a nice relationship and ended up fucking killing them.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of these are probably from the 60s, too.  One girl had the Rosemary's baby, like a haircut, like that late 60s, 1967.  It goes way back.  Yeah.  Like Helen, your...  No, Helen had a fucking beehive, a frosted beehive for the fucking hundredth time.  Helen did not have that type of hairdo.  Wow, look at that fro on that one. 
[02:34:30]  You got some fro's.  I love him, Tony.  And then you got some pictures that look more current.  Yeah.  But a lot of them looking like they're from the Austin Powers era.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Yeah, she is hot right there, that girl.  That's got to be like 1969.  Early 70s, I guess.  Somewhere around there, I guess, sure.  Yeah, that's...  Late 70s right there.  You can almost tell.  Headphones like that.  Big headphones.  Fucking late 70s, probably.  Yeah, maybe early 80s.  Maybe the back, man. 
[02:35:00]  Listen to the music while I choke you.  Yeah.  Jesus.  So anyway, like Jimmy was saying, the dating game, he was on the fucking dating game.  We got audio of his appearance.  This is ghoulish.  So you're listening to a future, if not already, serial killer in this audio.  Bachelor number one.  What do you think would be the perfect date?  Yeah, right, right.  This is exactly what we're going to get here.  Rodney gets introduced.  Well, let's see.  Bachelor number one is a successful photographer.  Oh my God, this is murder. 
[02:35:30]  Yes, who enjoys posing a woman with an M80 in her cunt.  Please welcome Rodney Alcala.  I made it sound so nice to be a photographer.  Nice little hobby for this guy.  A photographer who got his start when his father found him in the dark room at the age  of 13.  Torturing a small animal with his dick heart.  Found him in his dark room drawing X's over the women's chests.  And writing cunt in his own blood on wedding photos of his mother. 
[02:36:00]  He's probably just developing headless broads, you know, just purposely making sure that the  head's not in the photograph.  His father, he became a photographer.  His father found him in his dark room when he was 13, lopping the heads off of female  photos and shitting on the head part.  Stepping on it angrily.  Who got his start when his father found him in the dark room at the age of 13, fully developed.  Between takes, he might find him skydiving or motorcycling. 
[02:36:30]  Or choking a woman and reviving her and then fucking her mouth until she's dead.  Please welcome, you might find him raping a 12-year-old and keeping her earring as a souvenir.  Please welcome Rodney Alcala.  That's right.  Cutting her up in small pieces and posing her provocatively for the detectives to find.  Bachelor number one.  Bachelor number one enjoys puppies, especially ones that get seven-year-olds into their house  like Jesse Tomendikus used on Megan Kanka.  Please welcome. 
[02:37:00]  Bachelor number one enjoys collecting fine art and the severed toes of women.  Please welcome Rodney Alcala.  Well, he's not taking pictures.  He's taking souvenirs.  Ears, teeth, toes, whatever.  Yes.  Yes, bachelor number one is wearing gloves to hide the bite marks inflicted on him by a hitchhiker  who he viciously assaulted with a gas can.  What a fucking ghoul. 
[02:37:30]  What a dream.  Between takes, he might find him skydiving or motorcycling.  Please welcome Rodney Alcala.  Fucking serial killer on the dating game.  Wow.  And he comes out and he says, it's Alcala.  And just for that, I'm going to kill one of your female cousins.  Everybody laughs.  Laughs like, oh, that silly guy.  He's wild.  Well, Rodney talks about his favorite time of day.  Oh, no.  Oh. 
[02:38:00]  I'm going to guess it's three o'clock when the little cunts get out of school and I can  choke and kill them in my van.  I love that three o'clock bell.  Nothing gets my dick going like that three o'clock bell while I'm holding a hammer.  Where's the music, Travis?  Get ready with that music.  Yes.  Rodney's.  He says he enjoys caving in the heads of youngsters with a rock.  Please welcome Rodney Alcala.  He says his favorite music is the screams of a 12-year-old as he chokes the life out of her. 
[02:38:30]  What's your answer?  Truncheons and Garrets.  Or Garot.  Yeah.  Bachelor number one.  Oh, no.  Yes.  What's your best time?  The best time is at night.  Nighttime.  Yes, because it's easier to lurk in the shrubbery and attack one of you cunts with a pickaxe. 
[02:39:00]  Not as many people see you loading bodies into trunks of cars.  I like the night because it's so much easier to roll a hooker up inside a carpet after repeatedly  kicking her in the sternum.  Holy shit.  We're all like the night, you know.  Yeah, of course he likes the night.  The night.  Time is at night.  Nighttime. 
[02:39:30]  Why do you say that?  Because that's the only time there is.  Whore.  The only time?  What's wrong with morning, afternoon?  Well, they're okay with night time.  That's what your family will be doing after your date with me.  What's wrong with the daytime?  Well, you'll start stinking by now.  Yes.  And there's more traffic on my way to my secret locker in Seattle where I'll picture a photograph  with the others that I masturbate fervently to. 
[02:40:00]  Fervently?  Is that night vision shots too?  Oh, okay.  It's just a screen cam from Silent Hill.  Silence, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Stupid.  Morning, afternoon.  Well, they're okay, but night time is when it really gets good.  Then you're really ready.  Oh, then you're really ready.  Where's the clip, though?  Slice some throats.  Move on to the next one.  Oh, that's the whole clip.  Yeah.  Wow.  Rodney.  Oh, my God.  This writes itself.  Rodney pretends to be a dirty old man. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, does he?  He has an IQ of 160, too.  He has a genius IQ.  He's not a dumb guy.  A lot of these guys are smart, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, a lot of them are.  Did you learn?  Yes.  Real smart guys.  True.  Jimmy knows a lot about serial killers.  A decent amount, yeah, but they really are.  They deserve no accolades.  They really are fucking just pieces of shit.  Well, John in Buffalo is a very good question.  John.  Hey, John.  You going to Rochester this weekend for the big Jim Norton comedy show?  Yeah, I'm going to go out to see him on Saturday, actually. 
[02:41:00]  All right.  We'll see you at the club.  Sounds good.  But my question is, what type of screening process did they have for the show back in  the 60s?  They asked him if he chopped any chicks up yet.  He just said, do that yet.  All right, you're in.  I don't know.  I don't know if it was the phone or your material.  Hopefully, that's not the kind of comedy you'll be hearing at the Jim Norton show.  I should open with that.  That would be fabulous.  That was a 7.30 show tonight.  Ooh.  Why?  Why would you do that to yourself?  Why?  Why?  Why? 
[02:41:30]  I don't want to be upset.  I'm a drama teacher, and I'm going to audition each of you for my private class.  Bachelor number one.  Oh, no.  You're a dirty old man.  Take it.  Come on, over here.  Oh, hangy.  We ought to go out and boogie.  Yeah, that's fucking creepy, huh?  Fuck, that's exactly what he probably sounded like as he was choking a bitch. 
[02:42:00]  He should have said, look, do you need a lift?  This guy won?  No.  He won with these horrible answers?  Well, you didn't hear the other two.  Adolf, if we were on a date and a Jew was the waiter, and who was the other one?  Edie.  Who the fuck were the other contestants?  How lame is it when you realize you lost to a serial killer on a dating show?  One of the two pieces. 
[02:42:30]  I hope those other guys hung themselves.  Contestant number three, Charles Manson.  Rodney describes himself if he were a food.  I'd be stuck in your throat because you'd be choking.  That's right.  A bachelor number one, I am serving you for dinner.  Oh, wow. 
[02:43:00]  I know.  Wow.  The shoe's on the other foot now, lady.  I'd be a hot dog with two stinky onions.  It'd be great if he gave an answer like that.  A fucking damp hot dog with two stinky onions in a fleshy pouch.  Fucking soon-to-be-dead cunt.  Soon-to-be-dead cunt. 
[02:43:30]  That's right.  Ah, you fucking...  You're hysterical.  Thank you for dinner.  Oh.  What are you called, and what do you look like?  I'm called the banana, and I look really good. 
[02:44:00]  Now, can you be a little more descriptive?  Peel me.  Yes.  Peel me.  Did he say peel me?  Daddy can find anything.  Did he say peel me?  Yeah, peel me.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah.  The only problem with the search I did was I put in hot dog cock.  Yeah.  So depending on how you're looking at that, you're going to come up with some different results.  Hot dog cock.  Oh.  Nice.  Yes, that's great.  You got a woman. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  A fucking penis and a bone.  Oh, Jesus.  Stupid dog dick.  You can always tell, because a lot of times it's just a mouth on a dick, but then you  can see that there's a weird wily hair sticking up.  A wily hair.  Perhaps a play toy in the background.  It's a little too red.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Did you slam that in the door?  Oh, I get it.  He's barking.  Fucking dog dicks are horrible.  I would hate to suck a dog dick.  Well, okay.  It would stink. 
[02:45:00]  Smell his little dog belly.  Why would you ever have to, though?  I don't know.  You might want to.  He's barking.  You want to quiet him down?  Actually, I would be the obvious.  Who would want to suck a dog dick?  Let me correct myself.  Let me amend that.  I would love to suck a dog dick.  I like how the worst part of sucking a dog's dick was having to smell its stomach.  Filthy dog hair.  Matt.  I would hate him.  If I was going to suck a dog dick, it'd be like a fucking short hair.  I'd hate like a mangy mutt.  Oh, shit.  Let's go to Colonel in Georgia.  The Colonel.  I never touched them, Jack. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead, Colonel.  Hey, what if this lady shut him off by canceling on their date?  Imagine.  That's the problem.  All right.  Imagine.  He got rejected one time too many and said, fuck this.  I can't even fucking go on a date after winning on a game show.  She's responsible.  Imagine.  I'd be a banana.  We got one more fucking awful questions.  And Rodney is picked as the winner here.  Carol, we have reached the moment of truth, as we call it. 
[02:46:00]  You've heard from the battle.  Which of these three men would you like to be bludgeoned to death by?  Which of these three men would you like to pour gasoline down your throat to wash away DNA evidence,  which hasn't been discovered yet?  A moment of truth.  You'll be whisked to the morn.  Topsy.  Which of these gentlemen would you like to apply a toe tag to you? 
[02:46:30]  And your shallow grave awaits you in Aruba.  That's right.  You'll be taking the Natalie Holloway through with Justin van der Sleet.  Be fucked by two Indian brothers and a spoiled rich kid.  That's right. 
[02:47:00]  Your parents will be wanting closure when you're in vacation somewhere.  Carol, we have reached the moment of truth, as we call it.  You've heard from the bachelors.  You've got some great dramatic presentations and good answers.  But now, I'm going to ask you a question.  Will that date be bachelor number one, bachelor number two, or bachelor number three?  Who gets the dates?  Well, I like bananas, so I'll take one.  Number one. 
[02:47:30]  He's a skydiver, so he's got a lot of nerve.  He's into motorcycling.  He's also a fine photographer.  Say hello to Rodney Alcala.  Rodney, come on and say hello.  He got it with that one answer, the banana.  She liked the banana.  What kind of food would you be?  Yeah.  And yeah, like Jim said earlier, they never went out on a date because she found them very  creepy when I guess they were just talking backstage and stuff. 
[02:48:00]  So we killed the chaperone?  Yeah.  I wish we had the other two fucking guys' answers.  They must have been terrible.  Oh, it had to be horrible.  He's not a bad looking guy.  What kind of food would you be?  The one guy went, uh, sauerkraut jubilee.  Boo.  The third guy said, marmalade.  I'd be a marmalade.  Perhaps some poisonberry flavor.  Depending on your taste, my dear.  I can't believe that guy beat me.  I had such good answers. 
[02:48:30]  Wow, she lucked out by not going, huh?  No kidding.  But maybe it did set him off.  Sarge from Whack Bag.  What's up, Sarge?  Hey, I just wanted to know if the lead detective thought it was murder.  Yes.  It was an earring.  It belonged to a young girl.  She won the dating game.  She went on a date with death.  We're looking for a girl who went on a date.  Yes.  He might be giving a codeine. 
[02:49:00]  Her name's Abigail.  Abigail.  Stupid Abigail.  Either that or he's chasing her with an arrow through the woods.  Spends his whole rest of his fucking life looking for stupid Abigail.  Abigail, yeah, because somebody's giving her fucking, somebody's giving her Alka-Seltzer  nighttime.  Fucking rotten drugging.  These are all fucking, this is right after fucking like Sid Vicious dropped dead.  All punk rockers are doing heroin.  Abigail, he's giving her too many a leave in an hour.  It's the only Quincy episode we know. 
[02:49:30]  How pathetic is that?  We got to watch the second one.  I know.  I keep meaning to.  We got to watch one.  They're on Netflix and I just think.  Oh, I've been watching some.  They're hysterical.  I heard they've been giving us some Anderson.  Anderson.  Anderson.  Please welcome Rodney.  Yeah, the quality sucks.  There he is.  It's time to meet our young lady for game number one and here she is.  Any more guys?  Here's the young lady with a wealth of experience.  He just can't take it.  He runs out from behind the blind and just starts stabbing her in the chest. 
[02:50:00]  What year is this?  It's got to be.  These were the late 60s, early 70s was this.  What is she up to these days?  Has she talked?  Yes.  I hope those shiny teeth were knocked out.  They're fucking off a steering wheel.  Fucking ran into a truck.  Big toothy woman.  They hate her shiny teeth.  She'd have left nice bite marks on them though, huh?  They could have matched those up with her dental records.  She actually started the website gums.com.  Holy shit.  Back then?  Yeah. 
[02:50:30]  Exactly.  I'm an innovator.  It was a dud for 30 years.  Nice teeth, dick.  Look at those lifeless eyes from him.  He's awful.  She has nice legs though.  Great.  She's alright.  Take one with you and leave one with her.  Nice.  Uh, alright.  Oh, she's being a little flirty.  Yeah.  Night.  Nighttime.  Yeah, we heard all this.  Nighttime.  Yeah, and he's got like a crooked smile.  Yeah, he is all creepy.  He's got a lot of facial expressions going with his eyebrows.  His dryer lint hairdo.  God. 
[02:51:00]  That was the face they fucking looked into when he was just like in a rage choking the life  out of these women.  What a fucking kook.  Oh, God.  She's got a chin like Reese Witherspoon.  Spoon.  Yes.  We got another, uh, uh, Steve from Yellowstone phone call there, Travis.  Yes, we sure do.  I love those.  Come on now.  We'll set this one up as we step aside.  Yeah, this is when our old pal Scorch called in.  He had, uh, he had one of the Oompa Loompas in studio with him.  Oh, right.  I do not remember this one. 
[02:51:30]  This is a good one.  Fucking Scorch.  He had one in studio.  Could the Oompa Loompa hear us?  I believe so, yeah.  Oh, no.  I don't remember.  Oh, no.  That probably wasn't good.  All right.  Let's check it out.  Uh, let's say hi to Scorch in Syracuse.  What's up, boys?  The kingdom of, uh, nakedness.  It's the naked militia now, Ovi.  No, it'll always be known as the kingdom of nakedness.  Naked militia.  He's upgraded.  What's up, guys?  Are we live in Syracuse?  No. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, you are, but that's okay.  Go ahead.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You should have told me.  It's all good.  What the hell?  I don't have a license after today anyway.  Talk to these guys.  I don't hope not.  What's that, Scorch?  We don't need the kingdom of nakedness on this fine platform.  Naked militia.  Naked militia.  Uh, you want to talk to, uh, you want to talk to the, uh, the, uh, Oompa Loompas?  Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, the yellow Oompa Loompas.  Actually, we have a lot of people calling in that wanted to talk with the Oompa Loompas.  Yes.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Uh, one of which, uh, we got Steve.  Is that Steve?  Yeah, we got Steve on the phone. 
[02:52:30]  We're national, so we're all over, and this call is coming from Yellowstone.  Yes, um, he's a big fan of the movie, so let's, uh, let's talk to Steve.  See if I can make this work here.  Steve, you there?  Oh, my God.  Hello?  Hi, are these, are these, these, are these guys really, are you guys imposters, or are  you for real?  We are for real.  We are for real, and you can come and see us in over New York.  You can come and touch us if you like.  I am.  And I'm just talking to the chicks there.  I am actually a very big fan.  Um, I, oh, my God, are you the only two Oompa Loompas, or are there more? 
[02:53:00]  There are three guys still alive.  And there's one girl.  Oh, in fact, she lives in a twilight home, uh, in England.  Ramone, kill these green-haired little savages.  Ramone, bring me a spoiled family photograph.  What about the orange face?  Ramone, drown these two like the Smith children. 
[02:53:30]  Ramone, bring me a singing piece of shit.  I just arrived in Syracuse.  Steve.  I'm sorry.  Steve, I gotta apologize for Steve from Yellowstone.  He's very inappropriate, and he is not for broadcast radio with his language. 
[02:54:00]  That's right.  Horrid.  Hey, guys, I'm glad I can hook you up at the Oompa Loompas, but I gotta run and do a show  and get no ratings.  Okay, Scorch.  We'll talk soon, man.  Ruined family photograph.  My favorite.  Opie and Anthony.  Morning, 6 to 11 Eastern.  On the virus. 
[02:54:30]  Sirius XM.  It's time for O and A Q&A.  During his appearance on the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM's singing Southern DJ, Mojo  Nixon, referred to O and A producer Steve C. in song as which of the following?  Was it A, a know-nothing boo, B, a useless pile of shit, or C, a sweaty homosexual?  The answer in moments. 
[02:55:00]  And now, back to O and A Q&A.  During a song, Sirius XM's singing Southern DJ, Mojo Nixon, insulted Opie and Anthony's  bulbous producer, Steve C.  Which of the following did Mojo call him?  Was it A, a know-nothing boob, B, a useless pile of shit, or C, a sweaty homosexual?  If you answered B, a useless pile of shit, you are correct.  Are you saying, our producer's a useless pile of shit? 
[02:55:30]  Well, wow.  You really know your O and A.  Yay!  For you and bull for Steve.  Stay tuned.  More Opie and Anthony coming up.  May I help you?  Yes, uh, butt plugs?  Who?  Butt plugs, please.  Butt plugs, yes, man.  Hardware, how can I help you?  Uh, butt plugs. 
[02:56:00]  What is it?  Butt plugs.  A what box?  Uh, butt plugs.  A butt box?  Butt plugs.  I'm not following what you're saying.  Butt plugs.  I have a bad connection.  I don't understand.  What is it?  Uh, butt plugs.  Butt, butt box?  Is it like a receptacle you're talking about?  Butt plugs, yeah.  What kind of plug is it?  A spark plug you're talking about?  Butt plugs.  Oh, hold on.  Hello?  Uh, what are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Spark plug, what kind?  Butt plug. 
[02:56:30]  What kind of a spark plug?  Uh, no, butt plug.  I, I, I just don't understand you, sir.  I'm sorry.  Uh, butt plug?  A spark plug.  Butt plug.  Bug plug?  Butt plug.  Never heard of it.  What do you use it for?  Butt plug.  Huh?  Butt plug.  What do you use it for, sir?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Yeah.  Butt lug?  Butt plug.  I know, butt, but what do you use it on?  What do you use it in?  I'm trying to fix-  Butt plug.  Butt plug. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, okay, I got you a spark plug.  There's all kinds of spark plugs.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Butt?  Butt plug.  Uh, sorry, sir.  We don't understand what you want.  Butt.  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  I don't know.  We don't carry that.  Butt plug?  Yeah, we don't carry it.  Thank you.  All right. 
[02:57:30]  Get in touch with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call 866-WOW-112.  866-WOW-112.  That's 866-969-1969.  Now, the Opie and Anthony Show is now back on the Virus Sirius XM.  Featuring some of our favorite pranks from over the years.  And I think sometime today, yeah, we're going to do Cox in a Box. 
[02:58:00]  One of our greatest bits ever, where we were only allowed to do it once, and the lawyers  shut that bit down as well.  Yeah.  That would be the XM lawyers we blame this time around.  Greatest bits ever.  We had a box, obviously, with just pictures of cocks inside.  And what did we say?  Free kittens or something?  Yeah, it was like...  What was it, Danny?  Danny remembers.  I think the sign said free puppies.  Free puppies, right.  Free puppies.  And we just left it on the corner, and we could see the box from above where we were broadcasting 
[02:58:30]  on 57th Street.  Yeah, right out the window.  And then you would see these dummies walking up to the box, like, oh my God, free puppies.  You've got to lift the lid to see what the fuck this is about.  And just horrific cock pictures inside.  Something about, I don't know, child pornography, if a child saw it.  If a child saw it.  And they got all upset, but it...  But we did the bit properly.  Is that the official cocks in a box video?  Yeah, the video's up there, and... 
[02:59:00]  It's funny.  Wow.  And you know what?  We did have people on the street to make sure no kids were going to see the fucking  pornography, but the lawyers never see it our way, because this is a bit we should  be doing from time to time.  Some people got so upset, like, oh my God, they look like, oh my God, there's puppies  in that box?  Yeah.  And they'd open it up and just look at just hardcore.  Danny's wearing the same shirt that he has on now.  No, that's not true.  Oh, it's different?  No, I was much thinner than I can fit into that shirt anymore.  Oh, really?  Oh, really?  That's why you went, oh.  I love that shirt.  Don't you hate looking at, like, certain videos, and you're like, oh, what am I thinking? 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  But, uh, wow.  Yeah, just the fucking dummies just walking up the sidewalk looking into this box, and  the reactions was great.  Well, we're going to play the radio version of that bit sometime this morning to close  out our April Fool's prank show, whatever.  Hey, the boys made the Book of Ted.  What is that?  You know, you did the, uh...  That is funny.  You did Ted Christ yesterday.  I did, yes.  The boys made a little production piece out of it, yeah. 
[03:00:00]  The video's great, it's just too visual for us right now, unfortunately.  Here's a couple of things.  Oh, all right, all right.  They're looking.  No?  Come on.  Oh, oh, oh, here we go.  Here we go.  They're holding hands.  They're holding hands.  They're looking at the box.  They're ready to lift it.  We have to do this bit again.  We have to figure out how to do this. 
[03:00:30]  Hysterical laughing.  Who works for the show?  I do.  No, I know you.  I gotta go, we gotta go above you.  Who, who, who, who are these guys?  What are their names?  Can one of these guys go talk to the lawyers and tell them we want to do cocks in the box  again?  We did it properly.  Danny was on the street to make sure no fucking underage people were going to look  into our box of cocks.  Yeah, there wasn't any problem.  We have to do this again.  Look at him.  He opened that lid wide.  That was it?  All right.  We'll play the whole radio bit a little later, but first, the book of Ted. 
[03:01:00]  And now a reading from the book of Ted.  When the wine was gone, Ted had his disciples fill the drugs with water, and then a miracle  occurred.  And Ted said, I took water, and I turned it into crystal light.  The wine was now crystal light.  When the food was gone, Ted's disciples gathered, and the Lord Ted proclaimed, I took a bunch  of fishes and turned them into more fishes by cutting them in half. 
[03:01:30]  I have 30 fishes, and I should like present E with 60 half fish.  It was the second miracle Ted had performed, and Ted then divided the fish among them.  I'm working miracles.  The king was not impressed and ordered Ted to be arrested.  Oh, no.  They misunderstood me.  Ted shouted as he tried to explain himself.  I had an erection.  It was tenting out of my robe beautifully.  But the guards just ignored him, and Ted was taken away.  The Lord Ted was to be crucified. 
[03:02:00]  Ow!  My hands and feet are hurting.  Ted shouted as the nails were driven into his flesh.  As the crowd looked on, Ted looked to the people and announced,  I have it!  I have it!  I have it!  Not!  You go and forth!  Whatever that means, this has been a reading from the book of Ted.  Is that an epic fail?  I don't think that worked particularly well. 
[03:02:30]  Fail?  I wouldn't, you know.  Do you want to tell Derek how much he disliked it?  Why is Derek, um...  Yeah, he was all excited for...  Oh, poor D-Boy.  I don't know where he went now.  Oh, is D-Boy feeling bad?  D-Boy, oh, I really think...  D-Boy, did he come out around just to look and see what the reaction to me?  Derek always comes into my booth.  This is Travis, by the way.  Derek always comes into my booth.  What do you do for the show?  You know, push buttons.  Nice.  I think that Travis and Derek should do a beard rub. 
[03:03:00]  Derek doesn't have a beard.  Exactly.  It's the beauty of it.  Well, tell Derek to fucking grow a beard so we can do some beard rubbing next week.  I'll beard rub with D-Boy.  You would, right?  For the show.  For the show, of course.  It's not gay.  He's taking the Bobo defense.  Yeah, it's not gay.  It's for the show.  Oh, fucking Bobo, right.  All right, so I thought it was all right.  Well...  It wasn't terrible.  I liked it.  It wasn't terrible.  That's a...  I didn't mind it.  That's nice.  I'm sure D-Boy will feel very good about the reviews.  D-Boy.  Hey, we were talking about Newark because... 
[03:03:30]  Lionsgate put that out?  We went and saw UFC in Newark, right?  Newark.  And you know Newark is a hellhole, right?  Newark, it's called.  Newark?  Newark.  That's what...  Well, they're bragging today, Anthony.  Listen to this stat.  For the first time...  This is unbelievable.  For the first time in 44 years, Newark, a little city that's what?  Half hour south, sort of west of New York City.  First time in 44 years, Newark has gone a whole month without a homicide. 
[03:04:00]  Wow.  And they're bragging about that today.  That's amazing.  One month?  Yeah, for Newark.  First time in 44 years.  You've got to go back to what?  65?  That really is amazing.  Wow.  Holy shit.  First time in 44 years, Newark has gone a whole month without a homicide.  I don't know.  People are getting lazy.  I don't know what's going on.  You know what?  There'll be twice the homicides next month.  I'm sure.  They've got to equal that out.  There's no way it's actually getting safer.  I bet you they had one since we started talking about this. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, probably.  So that's big news for Newark.  They're throwing a party today.  Maybe they made it up in rapes.  No, all that shit.  I bet they did.  All that shit's down in Newark.  Everything's down.  Newark.  Maybe they're fudging the books.  They do that too.  Somebody gets fucking assaulted and they go, ah, we're just going to say maybe someone  picked your pocket.  Yeah, because we're doing good right now.  That's what happens in some of the police departments around the country and they get  in trouble for that.  And maybe they don't want you telling the world that's what they do.  No, just everyone knows it. 
[03:05:00]  It's no secret.  Believe me.  Everyone?  Yeah.  Oh.  It's no secret.  It should be a secret.  It's just business as usual.  Our business.  iPad coming up, coming out soon, I guess.  People are very happy about this.  Here's what I see from what I've been reading, the research I've been doing.  It's the Kindle.  The Kindle was doing so well that Apple said, fuck that, we're going to take a piece of  the Kindle market, right?  Is that what this is all about?  No, this is more so going to be a educational tool. 
[03:05:30]  I think it's kind of more of a niche thing than the iPhone, obviously.  It's a book reader.  It's kind of a book reader.  Yeah.  Now a teacher is going to be able to give you the books you're supposed to read.  Not every kid's going to be able to get an iPad.  Well, some of them are going to be donated to schools and sold to schools and bought by  schools and things like that.  That's what I mean.  It's not going to be something that you just buy over, go to the Apple store and buy.  It's going to be a tool to be used in the schools.  Yeah, but the kids aren't going to be able to get them. 
[03:06:00]  Some will.  Yeah, some will.  Some won't.  I mean, it sounds like a great idea in principle.  That's how that shit works.  And all of a sudden your teacher goes, all right, I'm fucking downloading all the shit  you got to read for this dumb class.  Yeah, and then you take it home.  You know, you got to sign it out like that.  You got to leave a deposit.  I love my Kindle.  And if it could do a few more tricks, that would be cool.  Because the iPad's going to have Wi-Fi, right?  So you could check some shit out.  Yep.  So you could, well, the Kindle has Wi-Fi, but you can't go to websites or anything.  Yeah, you're going to be able to do that.  You're going to be able to do that with the iPad.  Yeah.  What else? 
[03:06:30]  Movies.  Movies?  Yeah.  You can watch some movies.  Download movies right to the iPad?  Yeah, it's like an iTouch kind of a thing.  Why didn't fucking Kindle figure this shit out?  They had the whole market.  They don't have a touchscreen.  They just went strictly, here's books.  Such dummies.  And then Apple decides to make things better.  How long has the Kindle been around?  I've had mine for over a year.  I like the Kindle.  It's got to be two, maybe three years for the Kindle.  They had a three-year head start, let's say.  They couldn't figure out, wow, we should be doing more with this?  Maybe they don't have touchscreen technology. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, but they have a little keypad.  They could have got all that other stuff done.  Yeah.  You know?  You know, I read this stat.  I think it was 65% of BlackBerry users said, yes, they would have an iPhone if they could.  Why can't they?  Which means either it's a workplace thing where they have to have a BlackBerry because of where they work.  That's horse shit, though, because a lot of people that get a free phone from work, they go, you know what?  I'm not paying for this BlackBerry, so now in my personal use I'm going to get the iPhone. 
[03:07:30]  It's kind of a pain in the ass to carry two fucking phones, though.  I carry six.  I guess you're right.  And then the other thing is the cost.  It is more expensive, so.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  But, you know, when just matched head-to-head, that goddamn iPhone is just amazing.  I don't want to acknowledge that.  I don't want to acknowledge it.  I do play Paper Toss, though, still on my iPhone.  I love it.  Yeah.  I got some Paper Toss.  Paper Toss rules, and that's all I use my iPhone for.  I'm pretty much using a Top Fuel Dragster to drive to the corner store. 
[03:08:00]  To get milk.  And home.  Yeah.  Right.  I know.  You just, you know, let me take out my funny car and go to the mailbox.  And people that come over to my house, they're like, there's no way you're using your iPhone just to play Paper Toss.  I'm like, look, there it is on my desk.  Yeah.  You're going to see there's no phone numbers in it.  There's nothing in this thing.  Why don't you just get paper and a garbage pail and actually throw paper into a garbage pail?  See, you don't know the game, man.  You need a fan, too.  Oh, I know.  You need a fan. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah, and get the fan.  Like, set the whole fucking schmear up.  You got to set the wind, you know.  You got to turn that fan on high and then try to get it done.  I don't know.  I don't know why I don't want to go all in with the iPhone.  I don't know why.  Yeah, it's just the shit, man.  Let's say that again.  No, you.  Look at you.  I love the phone.  You went through so many phones during the time I knew you before iPhone.  Pre-iPhone, I call it.  You went through a few phones.  You've had that fucking iPhone since you had the iPhone. 
[03:09:00]  But I've had a bunch of different iPhones because I've broken them.  I understand, but you're not switching to another phone is what I'm saying.  No, I do like...  Jimmy Norton loves the iPhone.  You just don't like AT&T.  He doesn't love the iPhone.  He likes the iPhone.  There's a big difference.  Better than anything else.  David and Scranton, what's up?  I say.  Hey, I have a Kindle, and you can definitely go online with it.  Jimmy, can you go online with your Kindle?  I got an older version.  I've never done it.  I don't think you...  You could go to a bulletin board service.  What? 
[03:09:30]  But if you go under a menu to Experimental...  Yeah, you go on CompuServe.  If you go under a menu to Experimental, that's how I get online.  And if you don't need Wi-Fi, it's on the 3G network.  So it's like using a cell phone, but you don't have to pay for it.  All right.  Oh, so there is an Experimental on...  All right.  I didn't know.  I just downloaded some books here and there.  Although I haven't downloaded a book in a while.  Last one was the George Carlin book. 
[03:10:00]  Good one.  Prodigy.  Which was pretty good.  Yeah.  Could have been better.  Take it easy, guys.  Don't hurt your peepers, huh?  No, because of the technology.  It's weird.  It's like reading regular print.  Yeah.  That's the difference.  My, I was a shot, dude.  Mine are two.  My long-range vision is perfect.  You got the Twitch?  No, no Twitch.  I get a Twitch now.  It's the blur.  And it's just...  It's getting worse at reading.  I've gotten to the point where only at home. 
[03:10:30]  Only at home.  You got glasses?  I have them.  So that if I'm on the computer, on the laptop and watching TV, I could just go back and forth  and it doesn't hurt.  I had to do it.  For a guy that wore glasses most of his life until I got that LASIK surgery, I laugh at  you today.  It's only when...  And I'll tell you when...  Do you got the fucking bifocals?  Do they have to be down your nose a little bit?  Down your nose.  Do they?  Down on the tip of your nose.  You know why I do it?  If I'm on the laptop... 
[03:11:00]  And did you get the reading glasses from CVS or did you go to an Opti...  I just got shitty reading glasses from like CVS.  What do I need?  Because here's the only time I use them.  That's classic.  If I'm playing like online poker and watching TV, the switching from across the room to  right in front of your face, back and forth, it's so hard to focus.  Because like if I'm just using my iPhone the whole time, eventually my eyes will figure  out and focus enough.  But if I'm going back and forth like that, I'm a wreck.  Do you look like a nerd? 
[03:11:30]  I cannot bring myself to look at myself in the mirror with...  You haven't looked yet.  So I haven't even looked.  I haven't looked.  I get out of...  Danny just put the Six Flags dancing guy picture on the screen.  I hope those are your glasses.  No.  You can't even look in the mirror?  Morty Seinfeld glasses.  What's wrong with you?  No one's around and you can't even look in the mirror to go, oh fuck?  No, I can't.  Because I...  You're calling your four eyes, Anthony.  Ha ha, four eyes. 
[03:12:00]  I don't have four eyes.  I don't have four eyes.  Four eyes.  It's just for reading sometimes.  Four eyes, no liver.  Just for it sometimes.  I was called four eyes when I was eight years old.  It's good to know you're in your forties and we can finally call you four eyes.  Four eyes.  It just reached the point where I was like, I'm squinting all the time.  And like I said, my long range vision is fine.  I could fucking see fine at a distance.  But that close up shit now? 
[03:12:30]  I'm...  That sucks.  I'm scared.  I can't drive at night as well as I used to.  Me neither.  It's hard.  And I fucking had the LASIK and I think...  Driving's not bad at all.  I think I've...  Yeah.  That's not a problem either.  Driving is fine for me.  Well, you don't usually drive with one hand over an eye.  Are you that guy?  One of these Seinfeld glasses.  How big are your glasses?  They're the small ones.  What was the Hollywood guy's name? 
[03:13:00]  Shift...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Swifty?  Swifty Levine or Swifty.  Levine or something?  Do you have his glasses?  Swifty Morgan?  I don't know.  He had some obnoxious glasses.  Yeah.  Or Freddie Laker.  Look up Freddie Laker.  Freddie Laker?  He used to run an airline.  Freddie Laker.  I didn't even know this shit.  He...  He had weird glasses.  Yeah, but why...  Well, he's not showing...  They're not showing him with glasses in any of those pictures.  I think I gotta go to an eye doctor and see what my eyes are doing.  Can they...  Can they...  I don't know if they...  Is LASIK worth it at this age? 
[03:13:30]  I don't think they could fix like...  I wanna...  Is Diamond Vision still in business?  I got...  They're not?  I don't know.  Maybe there's another one.  I mean, they might be.  Well, Diamond Vision...  You know, those are my peeps.  That's Raquel Welch?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's all...  Fuck, she looks good.  Yeah, that's all plastic shit.  I don't care.  She looks great.  What do they do to her?  That doesn't look normal.  Dude, she looks amazing.  You can't even tell this shit.  How old is she has plastic surgery?  No way.  She puts some weight on, but she looks fucking juicy, man.  Is she 70?  In her 60s.  I would fuck her. 
[03:14:00]  Can a 70-year-old...  Look at you.  I would fuck her.  I'm right there with you.  Dude, you think she could keep her snatch clean enough, though?  Yeah.  So you get some shit done?  Sure.  Why?  What's...  Well, because she's 70.  I don't know.  She's 69.  69.  Holy 69.  That's bizarre.  Beyond the Cleavage is the name of her book.  Oh, it is, because there's pictures of her pussy on her tits.  Look at her big ass.  She's probably a great fuck.  We got a police officer who wants to talk about the Newark thing. 
[03:14:30]  Mikey in Jersey.  What's up, Mikey?  Mike!  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good, man.  Just real quick.  Yeah, that may be true.  I'm a police officer in town next to Newark, in Irvington, and their shootings have gone  up.  It's just that these motherfuckers ain't hitting the people the right way.  So, run it along for five minutes, one second, shoot straight.  Oh, God.  Everyone's doing their own.  You're saying they're just missing?  Dennis in Staten Island.  I'd like to speak to Ace Rothstein, please. 
[03:15:00]  The weirdest part about that is you can't even look in the mirror to see what they look  like.  On his show, Ace is high.  Yes, Kenny.  Hey, Mr. Magoo, why don't you put your glasses on so you can see how good Raquel looks?  Oh, Kenny's giving me shit.  That's right.  Oh, boy.  Mr. Magoo.  Oh, my, George, I can't see a thing.  Oh, this is good, Anthony. 
[03:15:30]  Rich in Chicago's got something on your glasses.  Rich?  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  You'll like this.  I bet those glasses are just great when you're reading magazines, like, you know,  as a pediatrician with your girlfriend.  You're an asshole.  When you're reading.  Oh, my Georgie.  I was licking the trout.  I thought I was eating pussy.  Oh, but Magoo, you've done it again.  I can read the bedtime stories better. 
[03:16:00]  Shut up.  You were getting everything wrong.  They're like, this is not how the story goes.  It's, it's, it's.  Oh, wait.  Somebody wants to say hi to Anthony.  I'm sorry.  Oh, okay.  Greg in Massachusetts.  Greg.  Yo.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  I wanted to know if Anthony looks like Harry Carey with his new glasses.  Do you look like Harry Carey?  No, I don't look like Harry Carey.  I don't look like Napoleon Dynamite.  I don't look like anybody. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know how I look, to tell you the truth.  Those are your glasses right there.  Harry Carey.  No, they're not giant glasses.  They're little.  Spread the word.  Anthony got Harry Carey glasses.  They're, they're little, um, like, thick, narrow glasses.  Hmm.  So, oh, oh, where are they?  Are these yours, Kenny?  They're fucking horrible.  You ever see Kenny wear his glasses?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, don't look in the mirror ever.  I don't know.  I don't think you were made for glasses, Ed.  You weren't made for glasses.  Yes, unless they're shot.  Look, look at, look at Kenny and his glasses. 
[03:17:00]  Unless they're shot.  As I'm getting a massage, take one right in the eye.  I meant shot glasses like alcohol.  Oh, I thought Mo Green, you wanted me shot in the eyeball.  I was with Jimmy.  See the way it works.  It sure does.  Both work.  What are you cleaning your fucking lenses off for?  Oh, uh, Anthony, sorry to break into this, but Joey at Long Island has some advice for you.  Joey.  What's up, Gramps?  Oh, fuck you.  The bus for Atlantic City picks you up at exit 36.  Now that you can't drive, you ain't gonna need your cars anymore. 
[03:17:30]  You're gonna have to take a fucking...  You're gonna have to take a bus to AC with all the old fucks.  Larry King checking in, Larry.  Terrible.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  I need my glasses back.  Do you have Larry's glasses?  No, I don't have Larry King's glasses either.  What do they look like?  They look like little reading glasses.  Do you have, like, the dice glasses?  No.  They're like the ones that Kenny just gave me, pretty much.  Guys got glasses like Jerry Lee Lewis. 
[03:18:00]  What does that mean, Chip?  Can't see good.  Oh.  I was...  I just...  Do they work, though?  It's...  Well, I get dry eye from doing my BlackBerry shit.  And then I look in the mirror after doing a long BlackBerry session, and my eye just goes...  No.  My...  You know, it's just...  I'm squinting more.  And I don't like squinting it.  It hurts.  Gives you, like, a headache. 
[03:18:30]  And then...  And then, you know, people go, hey, check this picture out.  And they shove the thing...  Too close to your face.  Like, six inches from my face, and I see a blur.  I don't want to push it back, you know, to the point where it's not blurry.  So I just go, oh, that's cool.  Right.  You know, this generation with their phones, they're all going to have fucked up eyes, man.  Right?  Yes.  I hope so.  You certainly are.  All right.  Damn them to hell.  Oh, Anthony, Chris in Pennsylvania, he's trying to stick up for you. 
[03:19:00]  Chris?  Hey, you guys better stop making fun of Harry Potter or I'll catch a spell on you.  I don't have Harry Potter glasses.  How dare you.  Bull.  Unbelievable.  Leave me alone.  My eyes were failing me at long range.  At short range, I mean.  What was the other thing?  It happens.  Bill O'Reilly, fuck, yeah, right on. 
[03:19:30]  Eh, you stupid Bill O'Reilly props.  He's going to pay the fees for the slain Marines' dad.  What is that, props?  In the Westboro Church case, remember?  Why is that giving him props?  He's fucking going to pay the court fees.  Walk through it, Opie.  Walk through it.  Oh, what?  Wait.  Why would he do this?  But you're a Fox guy.  You should be happy about this.  No, he's doing this completely for publicity.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  He wouldn't, if this wasn't a news story, he wouldn't do it. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, fuck Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah, this is, you know.  I must be running a fever.  This is the first person that jumped on it that had some cash.  I must be running a fever to even think anything different.  I mean, I'm glad that the pops don't have to pay for it, but I think it's a little self-serve.  Good point.  And it gets people like ourselves talking about it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  And then more people watch his show and send him letters and say, oh, you're great.  You know, I've done charity stuff that people will never know about.  Yes.  And so have you. 
[03:20:30]  Best way to do it.  It is the best way to do it.  Best way.  Best way to do it.  What the hell is going on here?  Something has gone wrong in the Amazon.  They absorb nutrients, so they just grow and multiply.  But with a little help from this guy.  What the?  Who's working for Barry Williams, a.k.a. Greg Brady.  Bombard the river mouth?  Are you out of your damn mind?  Tiffany can stop the terror.  They should have doubled the kiloton.  Oh, God, help us all.  The sci-fi original movie, Mega Piranha, premieres Saturday, April 10th at 9. 
[03:21:00]  It's fucking Patrice's bit.  All right.  It's Patrice's bit.  See, people thought we went into commercials.  And then some people thought, wow, that's got to be a parody commercial.  That's a real commercial.  That is a real commercial.  For Mega Piranha.  For Mega Piranha, which is a sci-fi original, which they make the worst movies ever.  Patrice's bit is they don't know.  They can't name these movies, so they just call it whatever it is.  Sure.  Instead of calling it Jaws, they.  Well, he did the whole bit.  Or that.  Yeah. 
[03:21:30]  Big giant shark.  Giant shark.  They use Mega a lot.  Right.  And Tiffany and Greg Brady are in it?  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  That's a star-studded cast, though, for a sci-fi original.  If it was 19.  Where does Lou Diamond Phillips fit into the movie?  He's probably going to be like the Quint character.  He's in every single one of these.  Who's going to be the Quint character?  Greg Brady?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, my girl even said, she just wrote me.  She goes, yeah, you've done charity I haven't even known about. 
[03:22:00]  See?  No.  Wait a minute.  Is that a compliment?  She's a fucking wise-ass.  Don't charity.  Shh.  We should take a break.  We got another, what do we got?  Another Steve from Yellowstone phone call.  Yeah, we got one more.  One more to do today?  This is a big one, too.  What is it?  This is, remember the positive cab driver that Jim had?  Oh, right.  He hated that guy.  I think this is when he was in studio, maybe. 
[03:22:30]  He was in studio, yes.  He came in.  This guy, we haven't seen him in a while.  We would see him every once in a while in the neighborhood.  He dressed up.  He had an American flag tie on, a weird hat, and then he would read a real nice positive  thing to you while you're just trying to get to your destination.  Again, like we said, crazy white cab driver.  If you get a white cab driver, then he's going to be crazy.  He looked like Benny Hill if Benny Hill was like a serial killer.  Yeah.  He had that kind of look to him, kind of Benny Hill-ish.  Yeah.  So he came in because Jimmy's like, oh, my God, we got to get this guy on the show. 
[03:23:00]  He came in, and we talked to him about him being a positive cab driver, and then it went  horribly, horribly wrong.  One day when I was coming in, it was quite a while ago where I told you that the cabbie  that picked me up was an odd gentleman.  Odd.  Yeah.  He wore a red, white, and blue tie.  That's what he's wearing today.  Yeah.  And he gave me some kind of a weird card with well-wishing at the end. 
[03:23:30]  I don't remember specifically.  I know we read it on the air and crucified it.  Yes.  But as we showed, it was awful.  And we tried to get him in.  I'm like, you got to get this guy in.  He's just a fucking wacko.  When you get a cab in New York City, or anywhere for that matter, you want to get in.  You want to tell the cab driver where you're going.  You want to get there, pay him, and leave the cab.  That is the perfect cab drive.  You seem to want to wear your hat.  You don't need the headphones if you don't want to wear them.  No.  You want to wear the hat instead?  No, that's all right.  Is that your cab hat? 
[03:24:00]  Yes.  You wear that in the cab every day?  That's like a chauffeur type hat.  Yes.  Like the classic chauffeur would wear.  See, I used to be a limo driver before 9-11.  Ah, you were.  After 9-11, there wasn't much left.  So I traded my black car in for a yellow one.  I'm still chauffeuring people around.  So why shouldn't I dress appropriately, positively, and professionally?  Because I want you to leave my car more positive than you came in.  That way you'll have more of a positive day and a positive new year. 
[03:24:30]  So who do we want to talk to first?  All right, let's go to Steve in Yellowstone.  Steve, what's going on?  Steve from Yellowstone.  Hi, I wanted to say hello to the positive cabbie.  Can he hear me?  Oh, you're going to have to wear the headphones, sir.  No.  Yeah, because people want to talk to you.  They've been moved by your story.  Hello.  Hey.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Yes, you're on with Paul the cabbie.  Hi, is this Paul the HIV positive cabbie?  Yes.  Hi, I just wanted to say that I think it's really nice  that in such a downtrodden world, 
[03:25:00]  it's nice to see somebody taking their job very seriously  and doing basically what is a good service.  Thank you.  And I think it's really good.  Are you still working on some design ideas?  No, I can't.  Ramone, this ghoul should design himself a shotgun blast to the face.  Ramone, Mohammed Atta had better design ideas for the towers.  Ramone, bring me a WC Fields-looking sack of shit. 
[03:25:30]  Ramone, this guy should be slumped over the wheel behind a warehouse in Brooklyn.  Sometimes we get these callers.  Yeah, they're...  Ramone, the positive cabbie is a cocksucker. 
[03:26:00]  Ramone, bring me a 55-year-old piece of shit  who looks like Carol O'Connor  and who still lives with his parents.  Ramone, bring me a chef with the mental capacity of a 5-year-old. 
[03:26:30]  Ramone, this ghoul should be shooting the president to protect Jodie Foster.  Sometimes, um, a caller gets a little, uh...  Ramone, I'll call back when I have some more shit written down.  And when you're sick, you're not well.  Yeah, Steve from Yellowstone is certainly a sick one.  See, there are some people that are just, you know, like you're positive. 
[03:27:00]  There are some people that are full of negativity.  Hey, we're going to Chancellus, Utah.  We're going to say hi to Travis.  Travis, you're on with the positive cabbie.  Chancellus, Utah.  Hi, um, I just, uh...  Oh, I really don't want to say anything out of line here.  Um, but I really, I like what you're doing.  I think it's good.  And I wanted to know how the response has been from people.  I mean, if it's okay for me to ask that.  Very good question.  Yeah, it's okay, Travis. 
[03:27:30]  Paul?  Yes?  Hi, um, I know that you're the HIV positive cabbie.  And, like, have, have, why, what made you decide to do this?  I think it's really good.  It's, it's, it's, it's, I think...  Ramone!  Give this guy a noose and make him wear it as a tie!  Ramone!  This bum should be driving Mrs. Daisy and then kill himself!  Ramone!  He should leave that faggity cab running while he's parked in the garage! 
[03:28:00]  I think what, what, uh, Travis, uh, is trying to...  Ramone!  I want to shave that cheesy mustache with a shovel!  I think this is, uh, not trying...  Ramone!  This sounds like Steve from Yellowstone.  The HIV cabbie should commit suicide!  Steve, we're trying to conduct an interview. 
[03:28:30]  Ramone!  Bring me an older gentleman who has lost all perspective!  All right, look, I know this is Steve from Yellowstone, and this is not Travis from Chancellus.  All right, I'm sorry about that there.  All right, anyway.  Oh, wait, wait, here's the box, by the way.  I wish I, I wish I was right there.  Hold on.  Hi, you just farted in the box-o-cocks. 
[03:29:00]  Yes, right.  I, you were doing your impression of James Polk.  Oh.  Wait, now.  Where'd old swimming pool legs go?  We just hung up.  I gotta go.  My, I guess Will, uh, thought we were having too much fun today.  Had to bring, uh, bring down the excitement and the happiness.  All right, I'm gonna go downstairs with this stupid box.  Oh, oh, it's time to play, uh, the name.  Oh, yes, it is, um, must.  Must.  I know that.  Must. 
[03:29:30]  Get box of cocks.  Must get box of cocks past piece of shit bit.  Did Steve, uh, work up, uh, like a, like a, uh, a sweeper for this?  Where's, um, where's, uh, where's the, uh.  I just can't get box of cocks out of my mouth.  I need, I need a microphone and headset and Sam needs a microphone too.  You got it.  Okay.  All right.  Um, and now let me just say what the box is.  I don't know if Sam filmed it, but it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, uh, an open box. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, Lord.  And it's filled with cock photos.  Jeez, that's a lot of cocks.  And, um.  The biggest one being right on the lid.  No, but look, look what's inside of it.  There's a dildo.  A pink fake cock.  That has been steadfastly taped to the bottom.  And it's standing straight up.  Dude.  All right, listen.  I got an idea.  Because this bit, after all the planning, might fail miserably.  Can we, uh, I say after the bit fails miserably, we leave that box on the sidewalk. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, good idea.  For all the nosy neds out there.  Put free on the, on the lid.  Like, just write free.  Not what it is or anything.  Just free.  Just leave the box right next, right in the middle of the sidewalk.  Oh, and then we'll watch what people do.  Yeah, because this bit could be Jimmy walking with a box past somebody that says nothing.  Right.  Huh?  That'll be good.  And Danny, you're on the street, you know, nowhere's near the box just so we can get the, you know. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, could we watch out of the window?  Yeah, please.  Please get the mics ready.  I want to see this so fast.  Miss, would you like to open this box for $5?  $5.  $5.  No, just leave it there.  Wait for the, you know, the nosy neds.  Oh, yeah, right in the middle of the sidewalk.  You've got to write something.  Do you want to do it now or?  Free.  Why is it free now?  Free.  What should it be?  Free.  Wait, how about, don't write free.  Just write. 
[03:31:30]  Like something that would make you, what would make you want to, well, you.  Box of cards.  Wait, why don't we ask the peanut gallery?  Yeah, what should be written on there that would, if you're walking down the sidewalk and you see a box,  what would make you open it?  Huh?  What?  Liquor.  Liquor.  Booze.  DVDs.  Yeah, just DVDs.  Just write DVDs.  DVDs.  No one's going to open this.  No one will open it.  It's really got to entice you. 
[03:32:00]  Well, this does set up a good bit.  We will plan this one better for next time.  Yeah.  And we should get an empty TV box or plasma screen box  and just put a giant fucking black dildo in there  and a blow-up mouth.  And go, suck this, plasma whore.  Why did I have to ruin it?  I guess we'll just throw it in the middle of the sidewalk  and see if anyone is, uh, we'll open it up. 
[03:32:30]  All right.  Okay, Lee, hold on.  All right, it's time.  I can't hear you all, but I'm transferring headsets.  I have no ability to hear nothing.  I can't hear you.  All right, good, no one's talking.  All right, I'm back.  People saying, do not open.  Please take one.  Gerald Ford memorabilia.  Human head inside.  Free kittens.  Please take one.  It's good.  Free money.  Free puppies. 
[03:33:00]  That might be good because people might actually think  there's puppies in there.  Free puppies.  Just write free puppy.  Yeah.  Free puppies.  Free puppy.  Please give good home.  How long is this?  Or just something like, like, like that year.  How about mother was hit by a Bueller on Christmas Eve,  the poor lass.  Free puppy.  Please bury her head.  Please.  Like, like, but free puppy might be,  someone might think there was a free puppy in there  and not even go to look.  But if you put please, please give home. 
[03:33:30]  Free puppy.  I don't know what the wording is.  Just write free puppy.  Free puppy.  Yeah, somebody will open it.  Yeah.  Free puppy.  On white paper.  Free puppy needs home.  Yeah, put it on the top.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, someone write that sign  and we'll add it to the box after the bit fails.  Okay, I agree.  All right, let's go.  Let's do the bit.  No, why not put it on the top of the fucking thing now?  Let him look.  Immediately, he can ask what it is.  What do you got? 
[03:34:00]  I'll just say it's a box of photos of men's genitals.  Box of cots.  OB's bank book.  Anthony's home address.  Free mumia.  Free mumia.  I'm going to suggest we write James Brown's head.  All right, free puppy.  There you go.  Put that on there.  Max leg shit bag. 
[03:34:30]  Could you tear a bigger piece of tape off there?  What are you, this fucking arts and crafts?  He tore off a smidge of tape for the corner.  Company man.  You didn't want to waste it.  You know what it costs.  Give me the fucking tape.  Here we go.  Tape.  Here you go, you fucking dainty motherfucker.  Oh, wow.  Holy shit.  How hard is this?  Jeez, Jimmy put a two foot long piece on, though.  Fucking tape.  Somewhere in between the two.  No, two pieces.  Done.  He's fucking smidging it off like it's an art project.  Oh, with the cover these guys made, this could work. 
[03:35:00]  It looks like a, yes.  All right, let's go.  If only we had a puppy.  Yes.  And then you fucking, you put milk on that cock and then the puppy is licking the milk off  the cock.  Open it up.  That's what we should do.  All right, here's another puppy.  A licking.  Here's a couple of fucking ideas.  Because one is we got to get an empty box that will entice people to open it.  And two, we have to get a dildo and put some kind of food on it that a kitten or puppy  would love and just make him lick it off. 
[03:35:30]  Like a fucking, a cock with like a hole in it, a little milk coming out of the tip.  That's my impression of an animal licking.  All right, let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  I'm ready to go, boys.  All right.  I can't.  Oh, there we are.  My phone's on.  Okay.  All right, let's go, Jimmy.  Okay.  Jimmy is carrying the huge box of cocks out of the studio.  I don't think Jimmy should have his headphones on when he's doing this.  I mean, it might be.  I know you're not going to be able to hear us, but right when you open the elevator. 
[03:36:00]  Don't they have the little ones?  I know you like the big ones.  They don't fit in his ears.  But how about a little one?  Just so you know.  Not the one that's been fucking in Danny's awful tomato ears.  Because it shouldn't look like you're working.  Yeah.  Like right now, it looks like you're on a radio show.  Yeah.  It should look like you're leaving the building.  Yeah.  Would he notice, though?  I mean, he's such a dumb piece of shit.  Would he even register?  The headphones.  Would it mean anything to him?  Put your hood up.  I know you think of him as a fucking lump of diarrhea from James Polk's ass.  He is.  He's just going to be like, God damn it.  All right, put your hood up. 
[03:36:30]  Let's see how that one looks.  James Polk's toilet with a tie.  Now he's covering it with his hood.  That's nice.  Yeah, that'll work.  That's good.  That works.  Jimmy pulled his hoodie up.  Jimmy, keep the microphone hidden behind the box or something.  If you're holding it with the box, he won't figure that out.  Big box of cocks.  If I wrote, this is a radio bit on the side, he wouldn't figure it out.  He's a cunt with a hat.  All right. 
[03:37:00]  Let's go.  We got two bits to do now.  We got the free puppy on the top of the box of cocks.  So basically, after he gets it past the security guy, we're going to put the box out on the sidewalk.  And then we're going to watch to see how many people open up the lid to see the many, many pictures of huge cocks.  I cannot explain to people how horrific these pictures are.  They're not like cutesy little soccer mom chuckles at a playgirl cover shot. 
[03:37:30]  This is hardcore, gay, hard-on, pornography, cock-up-ass pictures.  I went to college for this.  Yes.  Yes.  Okay.  Box of cocks.  Oh, Jimmy's acting, too.  Wow.  And he knows what to do with his hands.  That's right.  Hold the box.  That's right.  You idiot.  If I could hold a box in every scene, I'd be a star.  Fucking De Niro.  All right.  Oh, this box is heavy.  How's that for real?  Danny, you should get ahead of him.  Because we're going to lose the signal. 
[03:38:00]  So get near the door.  Where's Sam with the camera?  Oh, there he is.  I'm right here.  I got it.  All right.  Camera.  Camera.  The camera.  I just taped Sedan hanging.  We're going to need microphones because we're going to go right to bits.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good.  Oh, yeah.  Is there anybody down there?  I don't know.  All right.  He better be.  I'll probably lose you on the elevator.  Useless piece of shit better be down there.  He won't stop me.  All right.  Where are you?  On the elevator yet?  No, not.  Jesus, how fast do you think these elevators are?  This building's 200 years old.  It really does stink. 
[03:38:30]  Danny is just pressing the fucking button incessantly.  Come on, Dan.  Make it faster.  That's where Polk died.  Right in front of those elevators trying to make it to a toilet.  Pretty shitting ass.  Both of his boots were filled with liquidy shit.  He had to tuck his pants in like a horse rider so it wouldn't leak onto his presidential shoes.  Someone's suggesting if a kid tries to look in the box, we might want to try to save our jobs. 
[03:39:00]  All right.  Fuck him.  If he looks at his mother's closet, he'll find the same thing.  Don't worry.  Ooh, I heard the camera go off.  Was that what that was?  That was the elevator.  Are you in the elevator?  Yeah.  I think he's going down.  They could lose us on the elevator.  That'll happen.  Can you guys hear?  Now I can, yeah.  Okay.  I got...  Oh, no.  Hi, sir.  He didn't even look. 
[03:39:30]  Different guy.  Different guy.  We have to go to bit two.  I know.  I'm bringing it outside.  Why am I still...  Different guy.  Different guy after all that?  All that and the piece of shit ain't there.  That guy stinks.  Yeah.  All right.  Then again, maybe he died.  Okay, so there could be a bright spot.  Let's take lemons.  Maybe he's got what Polk had.  Can only hope he's on his home shitter.  With him, he's throwing up.  All right.  Where do I put this?  Where can I put it where you guys can see it? 
[03:40:00]  All right, guys.  I'm right in front of the...  Across the street.  I don't want to walk across the street.  Well, have Danny get it across the street.  We'll be able to see it a lot better.  Yeah, walk across the street.  But then again, if a truck blocks you...  Oh, wait.  Jimmy, right there is good.  I see you now.  Okay.  But it should be in the middle of the sidewalk because right there it looks like the garbage  man is going to pick that up.  All right.  Here.  We'll move it in.  Danny, move it in.  All right.  All right.  The box is in place.  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It's the shift bust of... 
[03:40:30]  All right.  A guy is looking.  He looked down at the note.  Oh, hold on.  I don't want anyone to do it while I'm coming up.  All right.  Where's Danny?  I'm here.  I'm in the doorway.  All right.  Whoa.  Oh, you just screwed the shit out of me.  Sorry.  I opened the window.  I almost took my eye out.  I almost nailed you.  All right.  The box is in a perfect...  Whoops.  I just dropped a knife.  I swear to God, I did.  Did you drop on someone's head?  I had a...  I mean, it sounded worse on the radio.  It was a plastic knife.  All right.  That's right. 
[03:41:00]  Now I'm all hooked up.  So far, no one's really looking at the box.  Where's the box?  All right.  Coming up right now.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  All right.  And it says free puppies on it.  Yes.  I see a couple of...  Oh, three...  Two young ladies and a gentleman.  All right.  God, no one looks.  Oh, that girl looked, but...  Sort of.  It says free puppy.  It looks so lonely.  It's like...  I...  Is it in the exact middle of the sidewalk?  Danny, could it...  Because it can't look like it's garbage.  You might have to turn it so they can read free puppy without turning their head. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  How about fucking turning it one way?  Wait, wait.  Like where everyone's coming from.  But wait.  Yeah.  Yeah, wait.  Let all these people pass just in case.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that guy looked.  He looked.  Did you see him?  Yeah.  Now here comes an older gray-haired gentleman.  He sees Bob.  They're looking at it.  He would have loved to have seen what was in that box.  I'm going to try and move it.  Move it kind of...  Yes.  No, no.  But move it in the middle of the sidewalk.  Move it away from the sidewalk.  Away from the curb more. 
[03:42:00]  All right.  Okay.  And straighten it out a little bit.  Make it look organized.  A box of genitals?  It's a box of cocks you're working with there, you douchebag.  This is much better.  All right.  Let's see.  A woman.  Of color.  Your son.  Here comes another woman taking a look.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  It's going to take one of these real tree-hugging animal lovers to walk by and take the chance.  Maybe should we have free puppy on the side, too, or is that... 
[03:42:30]  Well, this one's in...  Where's Jimmy?  Up here?  I'm right here, sweetie.  Oh.  Hi.  Imagine if we just looked out the window and saw each other.  Look at three homeboys walking by.  Oh, great.  Okay.  Hopefully they're not robbing somebody.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Guy looking.  Oh, God.  That's a piece of shit.  Hey, that's...  Hey, piece of...  That's a piece of shit.  He wasn't behind the counter.  He must have been in the fucking can.  Oh, some guy's...  Wait.  No.  Okay.  Here comes the three homies. 
[03:43:00]  God damn it.  The homies will look.  Danny, make sure he doesn't take our box.  It says free on it.  It says free on it.  Make sure at least he looks at it.  Homies looking.  Looking.  Free puppy.  No?  It might be a pit bull motherfucker.  We might have to change the sign on the top.  What do you think it should say?  Free puppy's getting people to look.  Free puppy's getting people to look, but...  They might think it's a prank.  It is New York.  That guy's still looking.  See, the homies are still looking.  Of course they are.  All right.  We need one guy.  We should take bets on who it's going to take.  Oh, please be the piece of shit.  Okay.  Here comes some fat person.  Oh, yeah.  A piece of shit could open up the box. 
[03:43:30]  Wait a minute.  Here comes a fat person.  Who's the biohazard suit person under us?  It might be food.  It might be food.  Free puppy.  Puppy's good eating.  Asian, she'll open it.  Puppy's good eating.  All right.  What about this fat guy?  Old guy.  Old ball guy.  Oh, wait, wait.  Wait.  Wait.  His hands.  God, people are taking a glance.  Look.  We might have to, like, fix up the box a little bit.  Here comes some.  Oh, please look.  It's going to take...  A lot of people coming out.  I think a girl will do it, but...  All right.  Come on.  A lot of people.  A lot of foot traffic. 
[03:44:00]  Come on, woman.  They're all looking at the box.  It's right in the middle of the fucking...  Uh-oh.  Kids.  Look at the...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Wait, wait.  There's somebody.  Oh, oh.  Here's a girl.  Here's a girl.  All right.  Look at...  A lady looking at him and shut the lid quickly.  A lady with a cane.  No, what was great was...  She's hobbling down the sidewalk, and she slowly opens it up. 
[03:44:30]  What was great was when she started opening up, more people gathered.  As soon as they all saw what it was, they all scattered and made believe they didn't know  each other.  Danny is down there fucking laughing his ass on.  Oh, God damn.  Was that funny?  Oh, that was good.  That was a good one.  I had to run over there just to make sure those little kids weren't going to open.  Oh, that's why he did that.  All right.  Very good.  He just saved their jobs.  Kids can't see some cock.  Come on.  Not unless it's real.  Why waste their first time on a fake one?  Here comes a couple of...  Are these two ladies, or is that just a gay guy, and they're two gay gentlemen? 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  If someone sits in the box, you'll know what you're...  All right.  They're going to...  Oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She's still looking.  She's looking.  Come on.  Come on.  Turn around.  Self-centered whore.  She goes, it says free puppy, and it's cold out.  It's cold.  All right.  Okay.  Here comes two guys.  They'll look.  They'll look.  All right.  These guys are going to look.  It's obvious.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Please lift it.  He's just looking inside. 
[03:45:30]  And now he's looking around to see who did it.  This is the greatest bit ever.  I love the box of cuffs.  They make believe they didn't see what was inside.  Okay.  A guy pushing a hand truck of New York Magazine.  No.  No.  He's done.  How great is this?  Oh, that's fucking funny as shit.  This is a great bit.  We're getting it all on videotape, right?  Danny, any comments on the street?  I'm just looking out for kids is my main concern right now.  Here comes a guy with an empty hand truck. 
[03:46:00]  He looks like the type that might look.  No, he's not looking at the box.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  There he is.  No?  No.  Okay.  This gentleman now.  He's not looking.  God, New Yorkers don't look around.  What about this old bald guy?  It looks like Bob Eatman.  Yeah.  Okay.  Take a look.  Take a look, you bastard.  It's like fishing.  All right.  Look in.  Look in.  He's looking.  Thinking about it?  No.  He's looking.  We lost him.  Another couple of gentlemen walking down. 
[03:46:30]  Here we go.  Pointing.  And two ladies dressed in the same coat.  Oh, they're coming in this building.  They're adding more.  Hold on.  They're going to add more signs to the box.  Are they?  Maybe one.  Like one on the side.  Okay.  Both sides.  Here's a couple.  Oh, all right.  They're looking.  No?  Come on.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  They're holding hands.  They're holding hands.  They're looking at the box.  They're ready to lift it.  Oh.  Oh.  It's a couple walking hand in hand. 
[03:47:00]  They pass by the box.  And the guy went, wait a minute.  And pulls her back toward the box.  And slowly opened the lid to reveal the pictures of Cox and the giant dildo.  They left in disgust.  Oh, that's great.  All right.  Here's a lady.  Oh, come on.  All right.  It's a cold puppy.  She's stopping.  Come on.  It's a cold puppy.  God, I love the ones that are thinking about it.  They almost want to do it.  How many have we got so far?  Three?  Oh, God damn.  This is a fun bit.  It's like fishing.  Here comes a longshoreman. 
[03:47:30]  It's this guy.  Faggot.  He's got a little arm bag.  Come on.  Look at the box.  Look at the box.  Come on.  You might be able to molest it, sir.  Anything in a box that guy wants no part of.  There's a bald guy.  This guy's going to walk into it.  Jesus.  He wants to hold the box.  I love him.  I would have loved it if he tripped and cracked his skull on a box full of cocks.  He impaled his eye on it.  As he's fucking texting Nambla.  Sorry I'm running late.  I have to testify.  I hear two girls.  A couple of ladies. 
[03:48:00]  Come on, girls.  Come on.  There's a poor little puppy in there.  What does it say?  Take a look.  Take a look.  Nope.  No.  Self-centered.  Fixing our hair.  It's all about you, isn't it?  How about helping that fucking poor helpless uncut cock inside?  Not even looking.  These two.  Sidewalk surprisingly busy today.  Yeah, it's good.  A little chilly, which is good because people think a puppy is freezing in there.  Danny, anything?  Any comments?  No.  Oh, a woman with a crutch.  A woman with a crutch.  Please.  Oh, you.  All right.  Why does Danny have no jacket on? 
[03:48:30]  Oh, she's looking.  Wait, wait.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move.  Don't move, guys.  She's going for it.  She thought about it.  She thought about it.  What about it?  Damn it.  Poor puppy sitting there freezing.  I'm actually looking at it like it might be a dog inside.  I might go check.  Look at this.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Here it is.  Guaranteed.  Come on.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Take a look.  Here we go.  This Asian guy.  Of course.  He's looking through the little hole in the top.  He's looking through the little hole.  He's going to have to look.  No.  He.  Oh.  He's still curious.  He went back.  He's like, what the fuck did I just say? 
[03:49:00]  He's looking in the hole again.  Open the lid.  He thinks he's laughing.  He's laughing.  He's laughing.  I don't like that there's a hole in there.  He thinks it's a skinny little white dog standing on its heels.  We've got a problem with our design.  Yeah.  They had to make a lid for the box, and it leaves a little hole that they could peer into.  And the guy obviously saw there was no puppy in there.  He saw the cocks.  Big head of a cocks.  20 minutes ago.  You stupid fucking asshole.  Holy shit.  How could you be so stupid?  Our whole bit is based on people opening a box. 
[03:49:30]  And you fucking taped it shut.  What did you write on the sign?  Don't look in here, cocks.  That'll work now.  All right, Danny.  All right.  Thanks, Danny.  Oh, my God.  What a blithering idiot.  No, I want to look at the idiot.  I'd rather look at a complete fucking idiot than people opening a box full of cocks.  We want to tape you to the inside of the box.  Oh.  Holy shit.  You taped it shut.  What a dope.  Travis, call him a douchebag.  Oh.  All right. 
[03:50:00]  We're back in.  Wow.  That woman shook the box upside down and couldn't get it open.  I've never seen a woman want to open something so badly.  Oh, we lost two people because of that.  Yeah.  What an idiot.  I saw him do it, too.  The object is to open the fucking box.  He taped the box.  And stupid me, I assumed no one could be that stupid.  All right.  Here comes a couple.  All right.  Here we go.  Back to business.  He's looking at the sign.  Nope.  No.  No.  One more good one.  Three people.  Yes.  Two ladies.  They're looking at the sign. 
[03:50:30]  Look in.  Puppy.  Nothing.  It's got a register in their head that, oh, my goodness, it's so cold.  And then, of course, they get the treat when they open up the box.  Oh.  Nope.  All right.  Oh, come on.  We'll get one more.  Come on.  We need one more.  Right now, there's a guy coming.  We can't end the bit this way.  No.  He's coming from the other way.  Somebody's got to look in.  All right.  Guy looking.  Look in. 
[03:51:00]  With a full head of black hair.  Nope.  And, oh, here comes a bunch of people.  Asian, lady, and gentleman.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, this old couple.  The old lady looks.  Old lady.  Come on.  Oh, she's looking.  Oh, they're looking.  They're stopped.  All right.  They're stopped.  Old lady.  Opening the box.  Open.  They look inside.  They look.  They look around.  Oh, the payoff.  Perfect.  The old lady.  I love the payoff.  Lifted the lid to see the cocks inside.  She obstructed the free puppy sign, though, with the other sign. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, Danny.  Yeah.  Get rid of that sign.  That is the worst taping job.  I can't believe he is that stupid.  All right.  Are we done?  Yeah, I think that might be it.  Yeah, we'll have to perfect this bit, but we found we could definitely do something with this.  Yeah, there is such potential here.  Yeah, absolutely.  Such potential.  Let's put a bomb in it like in Platoon.  Hey, this is important. 
[03:52:00]  All right.  As Danny backs away.  Danny's head looks awful from above.  Danny flipping the bird.  I forgot to get here.  Here comes Art Carney.  Look at this old guy using his umbrella as a cane.  Look at how old this guy is.  Come on.  Look in the box.  We need one more.  Remember what a big cock used to look like.  Even Channel 4 is giving up on us.  Yeah.  Bye, guys.  Take it easy, guys. 
[03:52:30]  There they go.  Look at the old guy.  He's just so tired.  Please open it.  He takes three steps.  He takes three steps and stuff.  He probably wants to report it.  There's just suspicious.  He hasn't seen it yet.  Oh, my God.  This guy drops dead of a heart attack because of Cox.  He's going to.  No, look at him.  He's making his way down the sidewalk.  He's giving it some room.  He's giving it room.  Wait a minute.  He's looking.  It says free puppy.  Come on.  All right.  Old guy's passed.  Oh, here comes a hippie looking chick.  She's got like some paisley top on. 
[03:53:00]  She would want to.  She can't imagine that there'd be a puppy in there.  Yeah.  Oh, here's a whole bunch of people.  Yeah, let's just give this one more because some people might come by here.  Well, we need one more now.  We've got to end on a high note.  Here's a whole group of people.  These people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  This is going to be a group effort.  Here comes the group.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the.  Okay, this tree.  He just looked right in.  He got a good fucking wide look at him. 
[03:53:30]  He opened that lid wide.  The best part is after they see it, they want to make believe they didn't see it as soon as possible.  Yeah.  Not acknowledge it.  All right.  Here comes a homeboy.  How weird is it that you know which ones are going to look?  Here comes an older woman.  She's not even looking.  She ain't looking.  Nah, she ain't looking.  That's obvious.  She's a hustling, bustling New Yorker.  Yeah.  Oh, what a scream.  Yeah, we got it.  It needs some tweaking.  But it's pretty good.  But this really has potential. 
[03:54:00]  We could get a tape recorder with, like, little dog noises.  Dude, the upside.  Yeah, yeah.  That would work.  Nope.  Those two have no interest.  All right.  We done or you want to try for one more?  We'll just wait.  There's one person walking by right here.  Dragging some wheelie luggage or something.  Is she walking up and takes a look?  Takes a look.  She's looking.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:54:30]  It's a free puppy.  She's thinking.  No.  We lost her.  Punch her in the face.  Punch her in the face.  It was better.  No.  That's about it.  There's a father and what looks to be his 11-year-old daughter walking down the street.  Danny, Danny, don't do anything yet.  Wait.  Wait till the second.  Because I want to see if.  Oh, hold on.  Someone's opening it.  Oh, he got a good look and he kept walking. 
[03:55:00]  It's a boxer to cock it.  He's on the phone.  Okay.  Let's see how close to losing our jobs we get here.  Yeah, let's go.  Danny, get in position and just yell, don't open that box if she looks.  Because I think a little girl might want to save a puppy.  20 feet away from losing our jobs.  Here it is.  Look at this.  15.  15.  10 feet from losing our jobs.  10 feet.  8.  7.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Okay.  Good.  She kept going.  All right.  She kept walking.  Oh, here's an old broad.  This would end the bit perfectly.  No, she's hustling and bustling.  Here comes an old lady.  Old broad.  She's got the jacket on.  Look, look.  She's looking.  All right. 
[03:55:30]  Here it is.  Open.  Oh.  Open.  Come on.  Oh.  Why did she get so close?  Why did she do everything but open the box?  She's old.  Absolutely.  We're so selfish because we can't stop doing this, people.  We apologize.  We definitely apologize.  If you understood how great this was.  All right.  Here we go.  Here's three people.  We'll have it downloadable, too.  Here comes a kid.  Oh.  Danny, tell the kid to open the box.  Say, hey, kid, there's a fucking PlayStation in there.  Oh.  That's what we put on next time, PlayStations. 
[03:56:00]  We get a big box of PlayStations we're holding.  Here comes a lady.  No, she's on the cell phone.  She ain't going to open it.  All right.  One more group.  All right.  Are these?  Is that a young girl?  Yeah, there's too many kids.  Danny?  Yeah.  Is that a kid?  Yeah.  You sure?  Yeah.  She looks 18 to me.  No.  Go ask for her ID real quick before she opens that box.  Hold the cop that once.  All right.  We're 10 feet away from losing our jobs.  Yeah, they're just going.  They're slowing down.  All right.  A couple of feet.  No.  All right. 
[03:56:30]  Passing by.  All right.  Boy, Danny's really making sure that kids don't go near that box.  I like my job, too, guys.  I like my job.  Oh, yeah.  Fanning Sam in the mornings.  All right.  The two weeks woman from Total Recall.  We'll let her pass by.  Oh, please stop.  One more.  Stop.  Now we have to go one more.  Feed that.  Yeah, feed the dog.  Feed that puppy.  Feed that cock something like your face.  Come on.  Look at it.  All right.  Guy in a Yankees cap. 
[03:57:00]  See, black people are too savvy, man.  They just know fucking street bullshit.  That this is bullshit.  Exactly.  Dopey white do-gooders.  But I hope let's pet it.  When this last group goes by, we'll call it.  Yeah. </pre>
