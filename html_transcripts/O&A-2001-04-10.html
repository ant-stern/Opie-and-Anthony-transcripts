<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties stemming from a malfunctioning router, leading to a humorous yet crude discussion of "Computer Guy" Scott Colombo and the hosts' own technological ineptitude.  This segued into a review of their past offensive on-air comments, pulled from their recording system, including a particularly tasteless joke about child pornography found on a computer. Several callers phoned in; one inquired about missing sports team members, another checked if the show was live, and Dominic offered to play "Tie a Yellow Ribbon" due to Napster issues.

The main focus shifted to DJ Moose Moran of KWDB, who was playing "Tie a Yellow Ribbon" incessantly to support returning American servicemen. Opie and Anthony found Moran's on-air persona and Fox News appearance incredibly ridiculous. They managed to get his station manager, Rick Bell, on the air, further fueling their amusement with descriptions of Moran's moose hat and on-air interviews.  Bell confirmed Moran's eccentricities and his ongoing radio marathon.  The possibility of Moran appearing on their show was discussed.  The segment concluded with sponsor promotions (Rockaway Bedding and Paisano's), incorporating the "Moose Moran" theme, and a trivia contest about a previous segment featuring a disastrous audition tape from a small-market radio team.

Next, the show aired and subsequently ridiculed an audition tape from a radio team called Randy and Claire, filled with bizarre content, including repeated mentions of "Monkey Pineville" and a song about a monkey dying in a bathtub.  Opie and Anthony called Randy and Claire, pretending to offer them a job at WNEW, revealing their interest solely in Randy's voice. They pressured Claire into singing her "monkey song" live on air. This transitioned into concert ticket promotion and a call with Jim Cook (Sam Adams), who reminisced about the "Sex for Sam" contest, including anecdotes about "Psycho Mark"'s firing.  Discussions covered Sam Adams products, a "grains of paradise" incident mistaken for marijuana, a new summer ale, and numerous callers, some offering breasts for beer.  A tape of Psycho Mark having sex on the boss's couch during the contest was played. Jim Cook was a studio guest for this segment.

A prank involving anal sex in their boss Ken Stevens' office, with Jeremy seemingly involved, was the next topic, followed by another call with Jim Cook discussing the rare Triple Box beer.  A heated argument with "Limo Anthony" ensued over WWF tickets and perceived social slights, culminating in angry voicemails and a phone call.  Simultaneously, Black Earl reported from a WOW promotional event, relocated due to unexplained street closures, with his own health being questioned.  The conversation then veered to Reverend Al Sharpton's trip to Sudan to free slaves, provoking crude and offensive jokes from the hosts about the price of slaves and Sharpton's methods. This led back to the Limo Anthony argument.  Artie Bucco from *The Sopranos* called, discussing the show, his character's fate, his impending divorce, and promoting a cigar dinner benefiting prostate cancer screening.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.

The final segment started with a caller questioning a prostate cancer benefit dinner's inclusion of cigars, quickly escalating into crude humor about cancers and sexual acts. A large portion focused on a Planet Java iced coffee ad campaign, with absurd and suggestive dialogue involving Jim Cook and various coffee-beer combinations, including the "Tremble."  The "Alabama-mow" sound clip became a recurring element. A sex advice-seeking caller led to further explicit discussions.  A caller confirmed rumors about Jim Cook and a "Uck Truck," sparking further ribald conversation. Another caller inquired about the "Alabama Man" song.  A significant portion dealt with a *Time Out* magazine sex advice column detailing a man's unfortunate accident with a flashlight, prompting a barrage of jokes and inappropriate commentary from the hosts and Jim Cook.  Discussions about various sex-related products and books ensued, using explicit terms.  Callers continued with their own offensive observations. The show ended with promotions for Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry, Sam Adams, and a "What Did We Learn?" segment.  Jim Cook took a breathalyzer test, claiming to be under the legal limit. The final moments were filled with crude jokes and banter before the show concluded.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The wisdom, the wisdom of Opie, of Opie, and, and, and, and, and, and.  Unprotected sex, good. Cigarettes, very good.  1027-WMW.  Hey, it's the O&A Show.  What's up?  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  You're going to need that.  We're kind of having a mechanical breakdown here today, as far as computers go.  Well, everything's running real slow. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, our computer's shot.  Well, the system's just real slow, like Ed just said.  Opie, it's the router.  That's what I heard from the professionals.  The router?  Scott Colombo.  It's the router.  What the hell's a router?  I don't know.  It's next to, uh, you can keep it on a cabinet above the table saw.  That's what I thought.  It's some kind of, uh, woodworking instrument?  Yeah, you put your nice little rounded edges on your table with the router.  Somehow, it also fits in the computer world.  The router.  Is he going to come in and explain what a router is? 
[00:01:00]  No.  This could be good.  Because we do have Computer Guy here.  Yeah.  But our Computer Guy is cool.  But he's still Computer Guy.  It's Computer Guy, and it's much like the SNL bit.  Oh, yeah.  Well, every play you work.  That's why that bit by Jimmy Fallon is just so on, because we all can relate.  It doesn't matter what you do for a living.  There's always a guy around that is there to make you look completely stupid.  Most people know just enough about their computer to go along their daily life of checking their email, websites, whatnot, until something goes wrong. 
[00:01:30]  You spend a little time trying to figure it out.  Then you've got to call Computer Guy.  And for us, it's, uh, Scott.  And he comes in, and no matter how hard you try and how deep into your system you went to resolve the problem,  he will, in two seconds, have it, click, click, see it with the, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I'm convinced he's a member of Chud.  He's a Computer Chud.  He could go a hell of a lot deeper than you could go. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, of course.  You think you've hit the bottom in your computer?  You think you've hit in all those child pornography shots?  Oh, Jesus.  That's just a joke.  But, you know, it's still on there somewhere.  And you've got to, you start digging into your system to try to fix it,  and you get to a point where you go,  Oh, no.  I'm not going to know how to get back here if I have to change this back again.  You know, you change the setting.  Oh, yeah.  And you had to open 15 windows to get to that setting. 
[00:02:30]  See, and this is coming from Anthony, who's definitely very computer savvy.  But I don't like going that deep into it.  And he's insanely deep into this stuff.  I'm a nerd.  So it's some kind of rotor that is slowing down our computer system?  It's a router.  Oh, rotor, router.  Router, router, I don't know.  Router.  Router.  It does what it's called.  Routes information.  Ah, hence.  It gets to the router and the router.  It's like a little substation thing that tells it where to go. 
[00:03:00]  Hence, the router.  The router.  Roto router.  I used to say root.  Root.  Other people used to say route.  Oh, that's true.  Yes.  Why isn't it a router?  I was a root guy.  A paper root.  I had a paper root.  You never said route?  I don't think so.  I was a route guy.  I was a root guy.  Carmine, what's going on?  Carmine.  Yellow. 
[00:03:30]  Yellow.  This is our only phone call coming in right now, so we're going to have to, like, try  to make this work.  Why is that?  Because the phone system, everything is involved with this router router thing.  With the computer.  Because it's all computers.  So our phones are screwed up, too?  Yeah.  Look, I'm knocking on the monitor.  I'll be like, that's going to help.  Look.  Look at me.  What?  Is this on?  Is this on, I think he said.  Yes, it is on.  Go ahead.  Hey, real fast.  I want to know if you guys are playing with a full squad today. 
[00:04:00]  What?  I want to know, you boys playing with a full team today?  Yeah, why?  You got Sid not showing up this morning.  You got Butchie suspended.  I want to know if you guys are not playing with that.  You're a full squad on yourself.  Odyssey.  Odyssey.  Odyssey.  Go to the Lunar Module.  Shut down power in the Odyssey.  I really don't know what he was trying to say.  I couldn't understand him.  We had loss of signal when he was on the dark side of the moon.  Let me go to Bill.  Bill, what's going on?  Yo, I want to know who suspended Butchie, Opie or Anthony? 
[00:04:30]  We just needed some more room around the hallway.  Oh, Jesus.  No big loss later, fellas.  Easy.  Stop.  We're all supposed to get along.  That's the latest memo circulating the place.  We all need to be on the same page.  The same page.  Can't they find another friggin' catchphrase-type clich√©?  The same page.  Let's see, Nick.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to make sure you guys are live after yesterday. 
[00:05:00]  I figure it was another Christmas Eve, New Year's problem.  You know what I mean?  Well, Nick, I can prove it.  If you're still digesting your Thanksgiving turkey, yes, we are live.  Yes.  Hey, listen, I hope you isolated the fact that you said you're a root guy.  You know what I mean?  I thought that right when he said it.  You know, I've given up on that, you know?  You start second-guessing what you want to say,  because you know Rick is just waiting there to write it down and get the line, you know,  into our computers for the next show. 
[00:05:30]  He will write down the exact time it comes out on the DAT.  You always tell when you say something and you put your foot in your mouth,  Rick spins around and runs to the DAT machine.  Which one did you have from yesterday?  Oh, hold on.  What is this?  From yesterday?  This is just a random example.  Yeah, these are some of the latest ones.  Pump my ass?  When did I say that?  Wait, start with all of us.  That's funny.  If we're going to play this game, we've got to start from the beginning.  If you can't tell by now, we're stalling, 
[00:06:00]  because we're trying to get Tie a Yellow Ribbon from Napster,  because we just saw something very, very funny on TV,  but we need the song so we can really get into it.  But this routing problem is driving us all nuts.  The routing problem.  Route.  All right, here's some just random sayings from that, all right?  Dick.  That's easy.  Yeah, I say that a lot.  I'm giggling like a faggot.  What about, oh, we can't say those?  I like dick.  I was talking about a guy. 
[00:06:30]  I like dick.  Ladies, leave your man at home.  Well, let's get to sex, hoping.  What a cool...  Moron!  No, dick!  Pump my ass?  Fabulous.  No one says fabulous.  Except gay people.  All right.  Guy like dick.  Guy like dick.  According to that machine, I'm flaming. 
[00:07:00]  I'd like to slap...  Oh, okay, we haven't believed that one.  I'd like to slap my...  Rick didn't believe that one.  Yeah, we had a tough out of that one.  Stupid friggin' twat.  That's my favorite.  Yes.  You're a friggin' moron.  You're stupid!  That's it.  We have Opie.  Yeah, but mine...  Where's Opie?  Mine are all just me... 
[00:07:30]  I don't know, breaking something.  I gotta get him off.  That's pushing it.  Wow, I am getting pounded.  Isolate that.  Yeah.  Yeah, you did.  Oh!  No!  That's what I say.  Say mine or like, you know, whatever.  Okay.  I got more.  I got more.  Oh, yeah?  He has a lot more. 
[00:08:00]  How are we doing with Napster today?  Are you guys giving up?  No, not on vinyl yet.  The world's largest rock and roll library.  Look at that pilfered piece of crap wall now.  It doesn't have it, though, huh?  And we can't get it on Napster?  Oh, maybe someone could send it.  Yeah, right.  I would choke the chicken in front of everybody.  I always wanted those pipes.  I know I'm a loser. 
[00:08:30]  I know my panties.  My favorite.  I'm not playing that one.  Play it.  What?  I love fat bald guys.  I'm a retard.  I'm a tool.  Wow, I am getting pounded.  All right, I know.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's it.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  Lovely.  It's not hard to play records.  Well, today it is.  We have a record we want to play. 
[00:09:00]  We can't get to it.  Well, I'm proud of this one.  Pull her pants down.  Yes.  Yes.  Yeah, we've heard this shut up a million times.  What?  What?  What?  A carpet maker.  All right, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  It looks like the phones are at least working, Anthony.  Thank God.  Now we need Napster to work in and some feedback.  We'll be all set.  Dave, what's going on? 
[00:09:30]  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I don't know.  I'm really confused.  I don't know.  I try to listen to the show every day at work, but I don't...  I'm missing something.  What is going on with the station and all of this stuff with all the other shows?  That was taxing.  Dave?  Yes.  Do you like our show?  Yes.  Do you like other shows on the station?  Um, well, I listen to Ron and Fez.  There you go.  And that's pretty much it.  All right.  So you like a few of the shows. 
[00:10:00]  That's all that matters.  There you go.  Not going to bat 1,000?  I don't think any station does.  No.  Of course, we'd like to bat more than a .001.  Thanks, Dave.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Can't get it.  Napster's broken.  We would love to help out our 20, uh, 22, 24 airmen.  Dominic.  Yes, sir.  Hey.  I got a tie-yellow ribbon on CD.  I can play it over the phone if you want. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, great.  Well, let's hear how it sounds.  Okay.  Ready?  Ready?  That's not bad.  Does that work?  Yeah, I guess.  Ah.  Yeah, but then we can't, uh, cut in.  We were going to do some classic DJ stuff for you guys.  That's what they're all doing now.  I guess we could tell the story, at least.  Fox News.  Yeah.  Stay there, Dominic.  We might need you, all right?  No problem.  Uh, Fox News had a little piece on this DJ. 
[00:11:00]  What's his name?  Moose Moran.  Moose Moran.  Moose Moran.  Now, I'm convinced he works at a radio station called The Moose,  and they give everyone at the station a Moose name.  Now, when you told me that, because I was under the impression,  the guy's name is Moose Moran, and we didn't look quick enough to see what station he worked at.  Right.  Whether it's the, what are some of the, the pig or the...  I saw, everyone's been to a, you know, a radio promotion,  and they had one of those radio station banners, and it had a moose on it.  Yeah.  So, it's either that the guy has his own banner. 
[00:11:30]  That's what I think.  Which is hard to believe, because all the guy does is play records.  But he's the moose.  But he's the moose.  Or the station's called the moose, and everyone has to have a moose name.  Which is unbelievable to me.  This actually happens.  Oh, yeah.  Where Moose Moran gets on, and then afterwards, Moose Davis will be on.  There's a, there was a station called the pig, I think.  Yeah.  And everyone had to have a name that had something to do with a pig.  A pig.  Right.  Like, like, Porky Pete.  Porky Pete.  Sure. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Sammy Snout with you.  Yeah.  Making bacon in the morning.  Oh, making bacon.  Right.  Our pals at the W-O-N-A.  So, I'm thinking that it's a station called the moose, and this guy has to have a moose  name.  Moose Moran.  Moose Moran.  But he's in the news today, and it's a national story.  He looks really excited on the news, because something tells me, Moose Moran doesn't get  a lot of TV coverage.  No.  And I just recorded this little piece off of Fox News.  Thank you. 
[00:12:30]  And I'm going to play this piece every day for the rest of my life.  And the day I wake up where I look like a moose Moran is the day I will take my own  life.  Bravo.  That wig he had on was a little much.  Just to make sure, because you know what?  I'll say it.  I think you and I are cool, and we do some cool radio.  I'd like to think so.  But time goes by, and you still think you're cool.  Right.  Look at a lot of the people around this very city of ours.  I understand.  They still think they're cool, but everyone else looking in, they know these people aren't 
[00:13:00]  cool anymore.  But now I'm going to have video evidence.  Yes.  So when I look at Moose Moran on my little VHS tape, and then I look in the mirror, and  I look similar to Moose Moran.  It's over Johnny.  And they had him in the studio, Moose Moran.  The camera was in there.  He's segging into tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree.  And he will be playing that, they announced, on Fox News.  He will be playing tie a ribbon around the old oak tree until they return the airmen. 
[00:13:30]  Correct.  Every hour.  Every hour.  On the half hour.  Hey, Donovan, not bad.  I'm listening.  Every half hour.  Well, I was hoping you were going to come in a little sooner than that, but okay, you're  listening.  Can you believe that?  So every hour, they're going to be playing tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree  until...  How pathetic is this that a guy on the phone has to cue in with the song? 
[00:14:00]  Moose Moran will be playing this song every hour until those goddamn shakes give us back  our airplane and our brave airmen and women.  Here on the Moose is Moose Moran.  Tie a yellow ribbon.  I can't believe I'm Moose Moran. 
[00:14:30]  And the whole community getting behind Moose Moran and the playing of tie a yellow ribbon  around the old oak tree.  And they're just, yeah.  They're putting ribbons around their trees and fences and stuff.  And the big story here in Moose country with Moose Moran, we ran out of yellow ribbons.  The whole community ran out because the support has been so strong.  And now we're actually having some ribbons flown in.  Let me look at one of these ribbons.  Hey, made in China.  What the hell's with these ribbons?  Can't we get American ribbons? 
[00:15:00]  So, obviously, we have a few problems with this.  First of all, the fact that Moose Moran looked completely stupid because they have footage  of him in his little radio studio playing the song like he just started doing radio, where  he's checking all the dials and the meters, making sure it's perfect modulation for Tony  Orlando and Don.  Right.  Actually, much like our own Ben for the Ben Show.  He was concentrating on his SAG. 
[00:15:30]  You know, this is what this guy's done his whole life.  Right.  And believe me, it looked like he's been in radio a long time.  A very long time.  Yes.  Maybe not as long as Fox, but...  Yeah.  The coincidence is that the Chinese people that are holding our men captive are torturing  them by playing tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree every hour.  Who the hell could take that?  Would you listen?  You're listening to the Moose.  It's your favorite God-effing show in Washington. 
[00:16:00]  I love the Moose Moran.  I love the Moose.  Hey, let me turn it on the Moose.  He SAG's tunes almost as well as then.  Right.  And then all of a sudden, it comes on again.  And, you know...  Oh.  The whole damn bus is cheering.  And I can't believe I see.  Here's the part.  I get choked up at...  Here it is.  One, two, ten.  How many?  A hundred.  That's right. 
[00:16:30]  Moose Moran.  You know, if Moose Moran had any balls, what he would do is play the song over and over  and over again and drive people completely nuts.  But he knows they can't even take an hour at a time.  Right.  Once an hour.  Once an hour.  Moose Moran.  Now, someone's got to help us with a bit of history here.  The first time tie a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree was played, was it played for  our hostages in Iran?  I think it was the Iranian...  Gypsy Rose, fellas. 
[00:17:00]  Huh?  Are they interested in sweet Gypsy Rose?  Not three times?  All right.  Queue up that record again.  We're going to come back to you in a second, okay?  No problem.  All right.  Yeah.  I think...  Because...  All right.  It's not a good situation then.  Our men and women are being held.  But they're being held very, very nicely.  For the time being.  They're pretty much in like a club med situation.  Are they fighting under 60 feet of water?  Well, when you compare it to what our hostages went through in Iran... 
[00:17:30]  In Iran, right.  You know, no one should be held, of course.  We know that.  But I think a lot of these people are enjoying their time.  Away from, you know, military...  Military life?  Yeah, military life and the studying in the classroom and the yelling and screaming and this and that.  I mean, they want to be home.  I don't want to downplay that, but...  Right.  I mean, when we played Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round back in, I think, I don't know, that's what's...  79.  Someone's got to help us with that.  It was a hell of a lot more serious.  Oh, they were held in these little vaults and rooms and they were blindfolded the whole time and... 
[00:18:00]  They were told they were going home and then they weren't going to be sent home.  Yeah, and for the most part, they were civilians.  Now, these people are military personnel that have been trained for such things.  But still, yeah, this has got to be a tough situation that just for the fact that they don't know when they're coming home.  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Moose Moran is trivializing Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree and what it really represents, Anthony. 
[00:18:30]  Yes.  Which is hostages being held and no sign of being returned.  And being tortured.  Oh, you need the torture in there, too, before you can play Tony Orlando's Tie a Yellow Ribbon for somebody?  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I think it's been trivialized before, though.  Like, some people tie yellow ribbons around trees when, like, someone's coming home from college these days.  Like, how is that?  Oh, I'm going to college.  Oh, tie a yellow ribbon around an oak tree for me. 
[00:19:00]  They tie them around fences.  All right, now, Tony's saying they played the song for the POWs in Vietnam in 1973.  That would make these two situations drastically different.  Did they?  Tony, did they, though?  Yeah, the song really came out in 1972, 1973, and I think the Vietnam War in it in January of 1973, and all the POWs, POWs started coming home.  So, in order to welcome home, they tied yellow ribbons around the trees.  Right.  Uh-huh.  And then when the Aranias took the hostages, that's when they said, okay, well, let's do this again. 
[00:19:30]  You know, we tied yellow ribbons, that kind of thing.  Bring it on back.  Right.  Exactly.  So I think they're trivializing the song.  This song has a lot of meaning.  Right.  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, you know, it's true it sucks that they're being kept over there, but definitely it's a different situation between being a POW and hostage in an embassy as opposed to, like, living in a hotel or whatever to do on that island.  I think it's a cheap radio stunt by Moose Moran.  God damn, Moose Moran.  You know what?  I hate cheap radio stunts.  Especially from any W. I can understand that. 
[00:20:00]  God damn that, Moose Moran.  All right, we got to talk to the Moose or the Moose Moran show.  I want to talk to Moose Moran.  Thank you, Tony.  All right, guys.  Someone get Moose Moran on the phone.  Once again, someone's got to help us because our Internet's a little slow here.  I think we'll get your instant feedback.  We need some contact numbers and stuff.  For Moose Moran.  For Moose Moran.  Where's this station?  In Washington?  All I know is it's in Washington.  It's in the same place that the aircraft was based.  Yes?  Rick?  Rick?  Somewhere in Washington. 
[00:20:30]  Somewhere in Washington.  Not where it's based now.  That would be China.  Hey, who?  It's Chang Moran.  Did you say China?  China.  I'm calling it China until our airmen and women are back.  You've been in Brooklyn a while.  You should be losing that Long Island accent.  China.  Hey, I got an idea.  I was kidding.  Remember the...  Pizza.  Hey, I got an idea.  Idea?  Yeah.  For this amendment.  Yeah.  It's idea.  Idea.  Hey, how's this for an idea, boys? 
[00:21:00]  Idea?  Boys.  I want to take you out for some Chinese buffet so I can yell at you in front of a crowded restaurant,  boys, before I attempt to give you your $4,000 raise.  And this check to the Shehoogie.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  I used to listen to that station, WPIG.  There's a K...  I think it's a K station, though.  Well, this one was in upstate New York.  It was a country station.  Oh, there's more than one peg station. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, I guess.  All right.  And they used to...  Their morning show was Ham and Negs in the morning.  Two guys.  Somebody Ham and somebody Negs.  In the afternoon, they had Smokey Joe Bacon.  Smokey Joe Bacon.  Yeah.  One of my buddies in college went to work at the radio station,  and they wanted him to pick some kind of pork product named Sausage Bob or something.  He refused to do it.  How retarded is that?  Hey, you're Sausage Bob on the pig. 
[00:22:00]  You know, speaking of that, because a lot of guys on the radio, it's not their real names.  I mean, I've told a million people, you know, I've been Opie since I was like 11 or 12.  I'm not happy with the name, but I'm stuck with it.  It's not a radio name.  But when Anthony and I got together, started doing radio together, they wanted to change Anthony's name.  They wanted my name because Anthony, not really a radio name, and especially paired up with Opie,  they needed something like Opie and Opie.  Right.  You know, something that could roll off the tongue, and it would be cutesy or something. 
[00:22:30]  Opie and Opie.  Opie and whatever.  Opie and Otis.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Or maybe something that started with an O.  Oh, we got some contact info for Rick?  There you go, Rick.  Write that down.  Well, get a phone number.  Well, who was that?  Weenie.  Weenie did a lot of...  Oh, you got the phone number.  Call him up immediately.  Call him immediately.  I want to ask him a couple of questions.  I want to message immediately.  We're going to be talking to the Moose Station or...  Good morning.  Or Moose Moran or... 
[00:23:00]  Moose Moran.  It is the Moose Moran Show, Anthony.  It's Moose Moran Show.  Right.  Oh, here we go.  It's KWDB.  The voice of Whid Bay Island.  In the Puget Sound of Washington State.  And if we have to ever work for a station on Whid Bay Island...  Yeah.  Please kill us.  I'm trying to find the personalities.  Oh, under construction.  Their website doesn't work?  Not the personalities. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  We'll get some info when we get them on the phone, all right?  Community calendar.  Back to Tom.  Tom?  Yeah.  So, what else about the pig?  Oh, man.  That was about it.  It was...  I don't remember.  They used to have...  There was another station, Froggy 98, that had Leapin' Padpole or something.  And they had all those kinds of wacky names.  I worked for one of those stations.  I worked for the Fox.  The Fox.  Ah.  Nice.  There was a Fox in every city in America. 
[00:24:00]  I worked for the Fox in Buffalo.  Yes, Rick?  All right.  I got the GM of the station on the phone.  Nice.  Moose Moran is the morning guy, so he's already off the air.  All right.  But Rick, the general manager, is on line 12.  All right.  Tom, I'm going to let you go, okay?  Thanks.  You're going to listen, Mike.  All right.  Hey, Rick.  Yes.  Hey.  Opie and Anthony, we got you live on the radio in New York.  In New York?  Oh, my gosh.  You guys are working late, eh?  Goddamn, you got that radio voice.  Yeah, listen to that. 
[00:24:30]  When I went into radio, I wanted a voice just like yours.  Yeah, well, you know, everybody has an affliction.  So, where the hell is your radio station?  Where the hell are we?  Well, we're located about 80 miles north of Seattle.  We're on...  Oh, this will tick off all the people of Long Island.  We're now on the largest island in the United States with the island.  Oh, well, that does blow Long Island to shame.  Yeah, well, you know, when the Supreme Court came out some years ago and said Long Island  is no longer an island, that kind of messed things up.  Made us number one, you know?  Well, you've got to take something and run with it. 
[00:25:00]  And I guess if it's the largest island in the U.S., what the hell?  You know, Rick, being from Long Island originally, I don't think anyone really cares.  Yeah, I know.  It's not kicking anyone off, believe me.  So, what are you guys up to?  Well, we saw the Fox News broadcast of your own Moose Moran.  That's correct, yeah, our Moose in the morning guy.  Moose in the morning.  Now, what does Moose do on his radio show there, Rick?  He does just about anything.  If you can picture a moose loose, that pretty well defines the whole show. 
[00:25:30]  You know, it's a little bit of music, a little bit of talk, and...  The moose is loose?  The moose is loose.  That is what he does.  Rick, are you Rick Bell?  Rick Bell.  Okay, and how come it says on-air personalities, Rick Bell in the morning and Moose Moran in  the afternoon?  You caught the website in the middle of change.  Change.  Ah, so Moose Moran is your new morning guy.  Yep.  Actually, when we started up, Moose was doing the afternoons and I was doing the mornings, 
[00:26:00]  and then things started getting just a little bit too crazy.  Moose was doing a little better than you, wasn't he?  Well, that too, yeah.  Ah, what was the moose doing that you weren't doing?  Well, actually, the moose was getting just a little bit too crazy for the afternoon, so  we had to move him into the morning.  Too crazy?  Give me one example of Moose's craziness.  Oh, Moose's craziness?  Yeah.  Well, let's see.  It's too bad this is radio.  I'd say that he has a tendency to wear a big stuffed hat that's part moose and about three-foot-sized 
[00:26:30]  antlers.  He wears those on the air.  Are you kidding?  No, I kid you not.  That was a little too crazy for his afternoon audience.  Well, some of the things he likes to do, he likes to do a lot of on-air interview work.  That's outrageous!  That is outrageous.  And he likes to do what?  A lot of on-air interviews with people.  Who's he had, some celebrities we might know?  Oh, heck, he's had a couple of different people.  Let's see.  We've had...  See, now you're catching me flat-footed here. 
[00:27:00]  That's okay.  We've got all the time in the world.  Uh-huh, sure.  We don't play music.  This is what we do.  Yeah, this is just like talk.  Well, I'll tell you who he's got lined up tomorrow, actually, which caught us by surprise.  All right.  And that's Tony Orlando.  Oh, my God.  Now, see, this is great.  Moose Moran's been playing Tie a Yellow Ribbon around the old oak tree every hour.  Every hour on the half hour.  On the half hour.  And he will continue this until our brave airmen and women are sent home.  That's correct.  And am I right? 
[00:27:30]  How many times has he played the song?  Or is it just on the morning?  Well, it started out a week ago only on the morning.  And then we shifted.  We now carry it all day long.  Woo!  So every hour on the half hour, no matter what the programming is, because in some parts  of the day, we have a talk show.  So even if it comes down to the bottom of the hour during a talk show, everything grinds  to a halt and Tie a Yellow Ribbon gets played on the air.  What do you say, Ope?  We steal this?  Can we steal it?  Wear a talk show, too.  Go for it.  Steal it. 
[00:28:00]  Use it.  We'll show our support.  We'll wear the moose head with the antlers.  I want the moose head with the antlers because that sounds pretty cool.  It does get a little strange.  In fact, I think if you watch the tail end of the MSNBC spot, you saw where he might  have stuck his hands on either side of his face and was wiggling his fingers.  He does a little moose antler thing with his hands?  Yeah.  I'm doing it right now, Opey.  Yeah, there you go.  I know.  And I want to punch you in the air.  Yeah, I got off the phone.  It's kind of funny. 
[00:28:30]  Just a little while ago, I talked to Rob Wilcox, which is Tony Orlando's agent down in California.  And, of course, Tony right now is back in Branson, Missouri.  Tony's still alive, huh?  Yeah, believe it or not.  And his agent said, after he said, you're kidding me, he said what?  Yeah, he says he's going to have Tony call tomorrow morning and wants to do whatever they  can to help out.  Just to give you an idea of just why we are doing this.  Tony loves hostage situations.  Tony loves the hostage situation.  Yeah, he's been involved in a lot of them.  Yeah.  All right.  So go ahead and continue there. 
[00:29:00]  So he wants to come in or get on the phone.  He's going to get on the phone tomorrow, and, of course, we're going to nail him to the  wall on a couple of things.  And, you know, just let him put his message out that we'll play in conjunction with his  song.  And that'll be on the air.  We'll continue to play that.  So I'll get a little bit more of a background to the song for the listeners, especially,  say, the younger listeners who are going Tony who?  Right.  You know, that type of thing.  But we've really brought this together mainly because...  Tony needs to like his Coke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know. 
[00:29:30]  Hey, who didn't know me?  Come on.  Our studios are on a hill overlooking the Naval Air Station, where the crew is from.  Right.  Where, you know, if we could throw a rock far enough across the street here, we would  actually hit the Naval Air Station.  Hey, hey.  You're in trouble for that, Rick.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  But what the heck, you know?  We're in a big steel building with no windows on the bottom floor, so you have to bust the  door down first.  Rick, just let me throw this out.  What if on an off chance they release the hostages tonight?  Is that going to blow the whole Tony Orlando interview for tomorrow? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, heck no.  We'd still have him on the air, and then we'd probably play one last honorable play of  Tie a Yellow Ribbon, and then from that, as soon as the hostages are released and, you  know, they're being returned, then we will start playing a week's worth of Celebrate.  Celebrate?  Celebration.  Yeah.  Oh, wait, wait.  Which version?  Cool and the Gang.  Cool and the Gang Celebrate?  Yep.  I thought you meant the other version.  What?  Who else does that?  Celebrate.  Is that Three Dog Night?  Madonna?  You know, you can't tell with Moose. 
[00:30:30]  He may do a medley of those.  Moose is insane from what I'm getting from you.  Yeah, he is.  I'm getting the feeling he might dip into the sauce a little bit.  Well, we do have a special Moose drink that's actually available.  You've got to give me the ingredients.  I'm drinking that today.  Hey, man.  It's actually, you know, you have to have this as a dietary supplement, you know?  All right.  But you can find it all over the place.  Now, I don't know about back east there, but out here it comes in various flavors. 
[00:31:00]  Vanilla.  Chocolate.  Strawberry.  A Moose drink.  Yeah, it's a Moose shake.  Can't miss it.  It's a very colorful label.  It's got a picture of a Moose on it.  Where's the alcohol?  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's one of those, you'll have to look at the ingredients on a bottle.  Rick, do you tip a few?  What's that?  Do you tip a few, wishing you were like in New York?  Do you like a couple of beverages every now and then?  Hey, what the heck?  Doesn't everybody?  Yeah, of course.  Especially in radio.  Oh, well, yeah.  Hey, you've got to keep the voice in tune, you know?  Listen, see, it's worked for him, hoping. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, I hear that, Rick.  Yeah, you know, this is CNN.  Oh, dare to dream, Rick.  Dare to dream.  Well, you're getting some national coverage.  Yeah.  Moose looked a little nervous on TV, I must say.  Well, you know what?  About 6.15 in the morning when he's up there, used to being in a nice little cave of his up there,  then all of a sudden he's inundated with these people with cameras and big lenses and lights and all that.  He just sort of...  He's a superstar.  Why didn't he have his Moose hat on during the segment? 
[00:32:00]  I think if you look close, you'll see the Moose hat sitting on the guest mic just kind of behind him there.  I want to run right back to the office now and replay the tape.  There you go.  I can't get enough of the Moose.  Is Moose Moran's hair real?  Oh, that was a question I wanted to ask.  I wasn't sure if he was wearing the Moose hat when they were...  The hair is real, but don't ask me about the color.  Oh, okay.  It looked a little dark, Rick.  You know what I mean?  Well, let's put it this way. 
[00:32:30]  Moose has been in radio for over 20 years.  He has been.  All right.  And he can't leave the biggest island, huh?  What happened?  What happened to Moose Moran that he's not in New York or Boston or Dallas or L.A.?  He actually was in the Seattle market for quite a while.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  And then, of course, he went to another station where he met the lovely Rene.  Is that his little sidekick?  That's his little sidekick who he roped and got married to.  Oh, wait.  He works with his wife on the air? 
[00:33:00]  Uh-huh.  Oh, my God.  So does Moose...  She's the news anchor in the morning.  So does Moose Moran and Rene have a pack of moosen at home?  A little herd of mooses?  Moosen.  Moosen.  Moosen meat?  A plural for mooses.  Moosen.  It's moosen.  Everyone knows that.  Well, they live in the boonies down here on the south end of the...  You know, towards the south end of the island.  So I'm not sure how many of those they may have running around in the woods.  As opposed to the thriving metropolis that's the rest of the island?  Yeah, well, somewhat, yeah.  All right.  And where have you worked, Rick? 
[00:33:30]  Well, I've been all over the northwest here, also down in the Sacramento area.  I started out with a station called KZAP, which was one of the first underground FM stations.  Little 5,000-watt radio station in Fresno, California.  Actually, it was on top of the Oddfellows building in downtown Sacramento.  Hey, look at that.  I love getting to know these little radio stories.  That's great.  Back in those days when we didn't have on-off switches on the microphone.  Yeah.  Used to just leave it running, you know, and you'd hear little footsteps coming across the hallway.  Oh, man, hey, what was that? 
[00:34:00]  Smoking pot.  Yeah.  What?  It's our new friend's station, Opie.  KWDB.  Moose Moran.  You got it.  And Rick Bell.  Rick Bell, right.  All right, Rick.  Hey, good talking to you guys.  Thanks, man.  Good luck with this little promotion you got going.  Yeah.  This is the biggest promotion that you've been involved with, I'm assuming, huh?  Well, here on this level, yeah.  Here on the island.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll probably have to, the mayor will probably, you know, declare this whole evolution 
[00:34:30]  as a, either a moose day or a moose week.  We're not sure yet.  Hey, we could get, we could have them killed if you want.  Oh, you got to, you know, send a message to the Sopranos?  There you go.  Yeah.  We have the, we're known to kill mares when we broadcast.  Yeah.  It happens.  Hey, would you like to meet our own Stinky?  We could drive him out there.  Hey, that sounds like a good one.  No, no, no.  We could just pair them up, huh?  Stinky just came in waving his arms.  We sent Stinky to, um, wherever that was. 
[00:35:00]  Wionna.  Wionna, Mississippi.  Wionna, Mississippi.  Just on a whim.  Right.  We, we, we make, we make friends every so often with stations around the country, and  then we send somebody from our show over there to just exchange pleasantries and gifts.  Yeah, could you send us a moose hat?  Oh, do you have moose in the morning shirts or something?  Yeah, we, we've got all sorts of moose mania memorabilia.  If we put you on hold, could we give you our address and you could send us some moose stuff?  Yeah, what is some of the moose stuff you could send us?  Yeah.  Well, we may have to send you a six pack of moose stuff. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, a six pack.  Is there a moose mug?  Uh, yeah, I believe there is a moose mug.  I'll check on that.  Moose coffee mug.  I'll have my moose hat on.  Moose hat.  And I'll have my moose drink.  I'll be all set.  Moose shirt.  All right.  And we might even send you some of that moose salve, you know, for the, you know, the sun.  Oh, like moose bomb?  Something like that.  You got moose bomb?  Who was in promotions that decided they were going to make a moose bomb?  We got some guy here like that. 
[00:36:00]  You don't need the sun to tan with this stuff, from what I understand.  Great.  What the heck is moose bomb?  Well, I think it's for growing hair.  Oh.  Or that fur.  Ah, it works so well for moose moran, I see.  Yeah, exactly.  I still think that's spray on hair, but.  Yeah, and I think that, you know, at one time he had another product that was, uh, kind  of rivaled, uh, you know, the, um, uh, what the heck's that other little manly stuff  they got out now?  Uh, Viagra? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, that, that, I think that was it, yeah.  I was going to say splooge.  Yeah.  Uh, West Coast Dave wants to say something.  Oh, West Coast Dave's on the phone.  West Coast Dave, what's up?  Moose Moran did weddings in Seattle.  Did he?  Yes, he did.  Moose Moran mobile music in Everett, Seattle.  Oh, you bet he does.  And has.  Yeah.  He still does.  He probably will continue to.  Yeah, he's listed on this, uh, Washington party DJ search page.  Oh, really?  So he'll DJ, uh, parties?  Yes, he does.  Does he bring the moose?  Can he come out and do a party for you? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God.  He absolutely can.  Can he come out and do your wedding or your bar mitzvah?  Rick, does he, uh, does he wear the, the moose hat?  He, he goes all out.  We gotta get him.  I have the number.  Book him.  You betcha.  Put who on hold?  The guy with the number.  West Coast Dave.  Oh, West Coast Dave.  Hold on, right.  All right.  Hold on.  Put, uh, West Coast Dave.  All right, we got Rick back on hold.  All right, Rick.  You.  If we put you on hold, can we give you our address and you can send us some moose stuff?  You bet. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  That's good.  All right.  I'm very happy we, uh, we spoke with you, Rick.  And I'm just sorry we didn't get to talk to Moose Moran himself.  Hey, uh, Rick, what song is your station playing right now?  At the moment, you caught us on, uh, right in the commercial break.  Ah.  That's all those spots.  Very good.  Yeah.  What song, what song are you playing at a break?  Uh, playing at a break?  Rick, let's see.  That should be, I think we've got, I think we've got the, I think we've got the, one of  Celine Dion's coming up here.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  I have a feeling that you're playing the tunes right now.  Well, actually, uh, I'm a little bit out of the booth in a second here.  I ran over to the newsroom and then, you know, somebody said, here, take this call.  Rick, is this your show that you're, is on right now?  Uh-uh.  Oh.  Who's on right now?  Who's on right now?  Actually, it's Rob Moore.  Rob Moore.  He doesn't have an animal name or anything?  Nah.  No.  Rob, you know, Rob also kind of doubles as our sports guy.  Very nice.  Hey, we got sports guy.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Well, you know, being local, regional radio like we are, we do a lot of high school sports  stuff.  You know, you guys probably are into that, that big sports stuff, you know, ice hockey and  all that other jazz.  Well, we kind of have just a few professional teams in the area.  You might have heard of the New York Yankees?  Missy, the New York Yankees.  I think they play soccer, don't they?  I think they've won an occasional championship.  Oh, one of the gals in the office said football.  Yeah, football, the New York Yankees.  Hey, they'd probably win at that.  Hey, are the gals in the office hot, Rick?  Yeah.  Oh, hey, I'll tell you what, we don't have to use the thermometer here. 
[00:39:00]  Ho, ho.  Wow.  Yeah.  We don't worry about heat around here, you know, just air conditioning.  Yeah.  Lots of cleavage and stuff, Rick.  Oh, I'm telling you.  Would you bang any of them?  Oh, B, that's...  Hey, you know, are you familiar with the tradition that the Eskimos have?  What's that?  Well, about sharing.  Sharing?  Yeah, go ahead.  We're waiting.  No.  Oh, you know, they do more than rub noses.  Oh, they share wives and stuff?  Hey.  Whoa.  What's going on over there in Washington? 
[00:39:30]  Rick, are you coming on to us?  That's not me.  Rick, you guys are going to have to hit the road, you know?  You guys are leading too much of a sheltered life down here.  I mean, just...  Oh, my goodness.  All right.  Well, we're going to let you go, Rick.  Yeah, we'll put you on hold real quick.  Rick, our own Rick, will go in there and give you our address.  And we need some moose wear.  Some moose wear.  Just to give you an idea who you're going to talk to, our Rick...  You want male or female moose wear?  Well, we want all the moose wear.  Yeah.  You guys are into lingerie, eh? 
[00:40:00]  You're going to be talking to our producer, Rick, who's into chocolate penises.  So have fun with him.  Got it.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  Hold on.  There he goes.  It's Rick Bell.  Moose Moran.  I wish we could have spoken with Moose Moran, Opie.  Why isn't Rick picking up Rick?  We could only be so...  There he goes.  Oh, now he can't hear us anymore.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine being that boy?  Wait.  Get Rick Bell to have Moose Moran call our radio show. 
[00:40:30]  Oh.  Okay.  Tell Rick that.  We want to talk to Moose.  Moose Moran.  He'll call us from home.  Maria, what's up?  You guys are so mean.  Why?  What's the matter?  Because that poor guy didn't...  You didn't even...  He thought you were so serious.  What do you mean?  We were.  I mean, he's so mean.  He's so unsuspecting.  You know, it's the whole East Coast, West Coast thing.  You know, and we were nothing but gentlemen to Rick Bell. 
[00:41:00]  Yes.  What was that?  We were nothing but gentlemen to Rick Bell.  You were.  And I'm really surprised.  You know why?  Because the answers were just...  Good enough.  Just too good.  When you got Moose Moran putting on the moose hat.  Oh, my God.  And then doing the moose.  I'm packing up here.  Doing the moose.  I'm sitting in front of my son's daycare because I had to talk to you guys.  I can't even pick him up yet because you guys are so mean.  When he said, you might see at the end of that story, Moose Moran put his hands up by  the side of his head and made a little handler.  I want everyone to look at your radio and thank Anthony and I for giving you the spine 
[00:41:30]  radio because you can have Moose Moran.  Because you guys have no idea what's out there.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Moose Moran wearing moose hats and drinking that moose drink and putting the moose bomb  on his head to make his hair grow.  And that's exactly why I thank God for being an East Coaster.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thank you.  So that's great. 
[00:42:00]  I wasn't expecting the great answers.  I know.  I mean, it was just whatever was coming out of his mouth was fine enough for me.  I love a little inside on the small market radio like that.  Hey, Rick, is Moose Moran going to call our show?  Yeah, he's going to put a call out to him.  I also called his DJ service number and left him a message as well.  Ah, Moose Moran.  I heard his voice and everything.  We can only be so lucky.  Remember when we spoke, it was a long time ago when we first got here.  We spoke to that couple, that DJ couple. 
[00:42:30]  What the hell were their names?  Oh, my God.  I hate to put everyone on the spot here.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's the story, though?  And they wanted a job here at NW.  Ah, yeah.  So they sent the demo tape here.  We played it on the air and then called them as the station and said we were interested in their tape.  And she sang the little song.  The monkey song, right?  The monkey song.  On the tape.  What do we have to give away?  Someone out there will have the answer to that question.  Huh?  Who are, who is the... 
[00:43:00]  We'll give you a choice at what you want from what we got to give away.  We got Jerry Cantrell tickets.  Nice.  We got tickets to see Disturbed.  We have Andrew Dice Clay tickets.  And, of course, Monster Magnet and Buck Chariot at the Vanderbilt on April 16th.  If you know the answer to that question.  The man and woman.  It's a classic O&A from, like, the first, I don't know, six months we were here.  All right.  We should take a break, Anthony.  Yes.  My God.  It's late.  Oops. 
[00:43:30]  How did that happen?  Ugh.  46 minutes.  Oops.  Moose Morant.  We're going to miss our time to play Tyella Riven.  If we keep up this.  We finally found it on Napster, so we're going to play that next as well.  Frecky.  Aren't you guys lucky?  Opie and Anthony.  Two hungry sharks in the world of unlimited halibut.  1027 WNEW.

Hey, Anthony, Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Everyone knows about Paisano.  We've been talking about it for two years, almost to the day.  I keep track, Joey.  I know you're listening right now.  That's right.  Waiting for our fine second anniversary gift.

[00:47:30]  We think it's a little hokey, but Joey figured, you know, this is a good idea.  So, Joey loves it because he called during that break and he loves Moose Moran.  Right.  He was brought up listening to him for many years.  Big fan.  So, just say, Joey, where's your moose antlers?  And you get a free glass of wine.  Right.  And then make the little antlers yourself.  Paisano and Mulberry Street.  You'll love it.  It's a warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  They got all the authentic Italian cuisine.  At least he doesn't have to be called Dave Thomas anymore.  Right.  See, Joey, it's a plus, right? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  All the food made from original Old World Italian recipes.  And priced right, you won't go broke.  The portions are huge.  And they have the great pasta lunch specials, too.  So, it's not just for dinner.  Paisano and Mulberry Street.  It's in the heart of Little Italy.  136 Mulberry.  Call them up.  965-1188.  965-1188.  They're open seven days a week.  Weekend still, too.  Paisano and Mulberry Street.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony.  All, all, all, all.  By his community broadcasting. 
[00:48:30]  This is 1027 WNEW.  We are.  We, we.  The ONA Show.  212-757-1027.  Jim Cook waiting to enter the studio.  We love Sam Adams.  Yes, you see what he had on out there.  He has a beer.  What does he call it?  It's like the beer rocket backpack thing.  Pretty cool.  It's a whole S-load of beer on his back. 
[00:49:00]  It looks like the Buck Rogers rocket pack.  Picture an astronaut going on one of those spacewalks.  That big thing on their back.  That's what it looks like.  And instead of an air hose or a retro rocket or something coming out,  it's a tap.  On a hose.  He calls it his beer backpack or his keggy.  A keggy.  Keggy.  We already have Moose Moran as the newest member of the OA.com message board.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  I don't see keggy being far behind.  Keggy.  Who wants to be keggy?  I'm surprised no one has taken pink lettuce.  Oh, God.  Pink lettuce.  Anyway, I don't see on the color, but if it's coming out like lettuce, there's a problem.  No one got the answer to our trivia question.  I'm very surprised.  We have some really good stuff to give away.  We have a couple more minutes to try to answer the question.  And the question is, Anthony, about two years ago or so? 
[00:50:00]  Maybe even longer.  Three.  Poof.  Jesus Christ.  Maybe this was when we were purging the audience.  So anyone that would know the answer to this question does not listen to the station anymore.  Well, remember the purge.  Yes.  And I do believe that they were auditioning shows, music shows, to come to this station.  So the tapes we were getting were from all over the country.  I believe this was for our morning show, Anthony.  Right.  It was.  It was. 
[00:50:30]  Woof.  Yeah.  Was it during the Evolution of Rock?  It was around that time.  Okay.  Great.  And we found a tape in the back of this man and woman DJ team.  And we played it.  And it was just hysterical.  Not in a good way.  It was like really bad small market radio.  Didn't we play Sticks?  Sticks Franklin.  Sticks Franklin.  Hey, Sticks Franklin with you.  Do we have Sticks Franklin's tape?  Yeah.  God, that was great.  I love Sticks Franklin.  Sticks Franklin with you. 
[00:51:00]  It might be on the same tape.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  We'll play him later.  Yeah, we'll play it later.  We got to bring back this bit because we used to play the air checks all the time.  Yeah, air check audition tapes from these.  And we'll do that a little later.  Marty in the morning.  Marty in the morning.  Remember that one?  Marty in the morning was another one.  All right, but one stood out.  Yeah.  It was a man and woman team.  Right.  And we called them up.  No, it's not Mason and Kalinsky.  No.  We called them up.  After re-listening to this tape we're about to play for you. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Mason and Kalinsky was the best choice at the time.  Jesus.  Who knew?  Do you want to hear some of their air checks?  Do we have the air check, too?  Yeah, get some of the air check first.  We'll do it in two parts.  Let's hear some of this show.  And we got concert tickets to give away.  We got dice tickets to give away.  Whatever you want.  No one's getting it.  But if you play it, they're going to get it.  I'm very insulted.  We don't have any old-time listeners.  Dude, if you play it, they're going to get it. 
[00:52:00]  So is the contest over?  No winner?  We're giving them another minute, Tops, as we set this up.  All right.  This might help.  We had one of the members of the show sing the monkey song.  The monkey song.  Which was a big part of their morning show in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On their air check tape, she was singing this little monkey song.  And we were like, oh, come on.  You've got to sing the monkey song.  She actually sang it live after some coaxing.  No, it wasn't.  You know why she was singing the monkey song? 
[00:52:30]  You remember?  No.  Because I just heard it when I was trying to cue it up before.  It's because they had monkeys running loose.  Oh, it was a news story about monkeys running loose.  That's right.  That's what they said on their tape.  All right.  So we got the air check?  This is the air check first.  Yeah.  I guess no one got it.  No one's gotten it.  No, it wasn't Carol Miller and Scott Muni.  No.  Mike and Maddie show.  No.  No.  Amy and Jamie.  No.  No.  Ray and Kuchenbacker. 
[00:53:00]  No.  Dolenz.  No.  All right.  No one got it.  It's obvious.  Curtis and Kubi.  No.  Ron and Fez.  No.  Curtis and Lisa.  Sleeve.  That's funny.  All right.  No.  Let's just play the air check.  All right.  Contest over.  You blew it.  Over here?  Yeah.  556.  It's time to wake up late. 
[00:53:30]  Get ready to be.  It's a shame, it's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's a shame.  It's time to get up.  Yeah.  Start your day with plenty of advice from the Randy and Claire show.  Randy and Claire, everyone.  It's Randy and Claire.  They were trying out to get the morning show here at WNW.  So they took some of their best stuff and sent it here.  Right.  Here we go.  Pull up.  Turn on the woman, too, guys.  That's nothing you need to know about them.  Okay, you're on now.  Thank you.  I didn't realize where my switch was. 
[00:54:00]  What?  You're on the switch.  It's a great one.  Hold is 104.3.  Yes.  Hold is 104.3.  You know what this station really is?  What is it?  It really is KEZP.  Bunky Pineville Alexandria.  Yeah, this is like bringing back flashbacks.  We were like, what?  I didn't understand what they were talking about.  He has one of those classic jock styles, too.  Yeah.  Where they just kind of...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Of course.  Wow.  They have to know.  KEZP.  What?  Monkey Pineville.  What?  What?  What are they talking about?  That whole thing.  I didn't understand one thing they were saying.  That's a classic jock style, though.  Just to kind of laugh.  Even though nothing funny is going on.  And I don't understand what we're saying about Monkey Pineville.  56 degrees, man.  You know what this station really is?  KEZP.  I don't even know what that means.  Monkey Pineville.  That's a monkey business.  Monkey Pineville.  All right.  Here we go. 
[00:55:00]  The only morning show that takes you to the limit for you.  Every single day.  Randy and Claire.  622.  You heard about those monkeys?  Yeah.  622.  Randy and Claire.  Every day.  She does that every day.  Yeah.  Every day.  Every day.  I got to laugh at every day.  Randy and Claire show.  Monkey Pineville.  Another classic jock move that this guy does.  Yeah.  The name of the song, Work It Into Your Rap.  Ah, of course.  The Eagles taking it to the limit.  We take it to the limit every morning for you. 
[00:55:30]  Someone shoot me in the head.  Rick, can you back up?  Because this is the story.  Back up like two seconds.  That's great.  Good luck trying to back up two seconds on a dab player.  Oh, look at that.  Okay, very good.  Here we go.  Single day.  Randy and Claire.  622.  You heard about those monkeys that escaped in Covington, huh?  The Tulane Research Center?  I sure did.  Twenty-four of them got away.  Now, they're not dangerous unless you corner them. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Or, you know, unless they get a taste of nightlife on Bourbon Street.  Some of the monkeys are still loose if you're down that way.  Be careful of the monkeys.  Stand by.  Poor monkey.  Oldies 104.  We've got more monkeys coming up.  We've even got monkey music for you.  Surrounded by humans, the poor things.  Well, in case they're listening, we've got monkey music coming up.  Do we really?  It's a special service to the people.  Oh, this is dedicated to the monkey I love.  Is he listening?  Well, I know you.  This is Wednesday morning.  I know you.  Oldies 104.  That's a good sponsor for us.  Oldies 104.  Since we're kind of unwired, too. 
[00:56:30]  626.  I promised monkey music.  Why don't you sing that little monkey song that you sing in the...  I did sing my monkey song.  ...that you sing in the bathtub, Claire.  Uh, pfft.  I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  I put him in the bathtub to teach him how to swim.  He drank up all the water.  He ate up all the soap.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  Great, merciful crowd.  I'll be your witness.  That's the monkey song you sing in the bathtub.  Oldies 104.  7.3.  Oldies 104.  7.20.  What do you think the most memorable James Bond girl is? 
[00:57:00]  I don't know.  What do you think the most memorable White House intern is?  Oh, gee.  Let me think.  Oh, let's see.  She's dark-haired.  Um, I think, um, she wears red lips.  They've done songs about her.  I met a girl.  She caused me grief and pain.  She's your president.  I didn't want to.  That doesn't mean what you thought it meant, Claire.  The porn he's talking about is he looked at the federal budget.  That's what's pornographic.  Oh, it is very pornographic.  He's not looking at it.  Huge!  Oldies 104.3! 
[00:57:30]  Don't want music me!  Joy ship!  What's joy ship?  I still take everyone.  Hey, 104.  It's so wonderful being in Kaufman at 8 part 5.  Thanks for catching the conversation.  Why is he laughing there?  What?  What?  Why is he laughing there?  Karen Rochelle DeSalle, you know, that's coming up.  And I'm going to pick it today.  You ladies can just kind of stand up.  I picked it today.  I picked it today.  I'm not taking credit for this comedy corner.  I know.  You like this one.  It's about food.  You have a thing for food. 
[00:58:00]  It's not just about food.  It's about food and domination.  Well, good.  752.  Stand by for that on Oldies 104.  What the hell were you thinking?  Is that it?  That's the end of the entire check?  That's it.  Oh, my dear sweet God.  All right.  This is where it gets good.  So they sent that tape convinced that they were good enough to do mornings.  Did a good job.  You know, they saw the ad in the trade papers at WNEW here in New York City. 
[00:58:30]  And who are we kidding?  They are good enough to do mornings.  Hell yeah.  No, I'm just kidding.  What, guys?  Randy and Claire.  Morning.  So they sent a tape.  Randy and Claire.  And Claire.  They're two bringing mother effers.  And they felt it was good enough to send here to New York.  Right.  And get a job.  Maybe the big break they're looking for.  Leave the market they're in, which I don't even know where it was.  I don't know. 
[00:59:00]  Monkey Pines.  And come to New York.  Right.  So we got a hold of the tape, listened to it, played it.  And then decided we were going to call up the show.  The Randy and Claire show.  Randy and Claire show.  And tell them that they had a shot at this.  Right.  That we heard their tape and loved it.  Right.  And see where it went.  Correct.  Here it is.  Hello.  Hi.  Is Randy in?  Oh, no.  He's not going to take a message for him.  Uh, yes.  This is WNEW in New York calling.  We received his demo tape. 
[00:59:30]  Yes.  And we kind of enjoyed it.  We're looking for more material from him.  Okay.  Who do you need to speak to?  Uh, that would be Vinnie Cuny.  Vinnie?  Yes.  Uh, what will we call back?  By the way, who is that, Opie?  Swear to God, it's a guy, uh, a friend of mine from my school.  A high school, another high school name you pulled out of that?  Yeah, who listens to this, uh, this show.  What's weird about this is we were calling Randy's number.  Yeah.  And for some reason, Claire is there.  We didn't know at the time, but this is actually Claire from Randy and Claire on the phone. 
[01:00:00]  I guess they're banging or married or something.  Who knows?  Yeah.  I'm not real sure.  Um, what time would be good for you?  Uh, pretty much first thing tomorrow morning.  We're looking for a new morning show here.  Okay.  And, uh, I think he might have something.  Okay.  Do you think he could talk with a New York accent?  Hmm.  Because it sounds a little Southern for up here, but I think if he works on his New York accent, people will get it.  I think it's endearing, though.  Quite frankly. 
[01:00:30]  I kind of like that, um, the Southern thing.  Would you be willing to move to New York with Randy?  Um, yeah.  There's a lot of shopping in Midtown.  And, uh, how is, uh, Claire?  That's me.  Oh, you're Claire?  Yes.  Oh.  Are you married?  No.  Oh.  See, I, I had, uh, uh, erroneous information.  Who is this?  Are you the Claire for the Randy and Claire show?  Yes.  Oh, that, oh, well, there's a little problem. 
[01:01:00]  Okay.  We, we kind of liked Randy's, uh, part of the tape.  Mm-hmm.  I didn't know I was actually going to talk to you.  This happens all the time on radio, by the way.  We are giving you an insight to radio.  This happens all the time.  They like one voice on the tape.  Um, uh, no, I think Claire's endearing.  Are you good at making coffee?  Yes.  Well, I think we can work something out, but. 
[01:01:30]  Okay, well, um, I'll have him call you then.  Okay.  It's Vitty Cutie, WNW Radio.  Thank you.  All right, Claire.  Hey, wait a minute, Claire.  Yes.  Could you sing the monkey song for us?  I just want to hear that monkey song.  I heard it on the tape, and we love it.  I just don't know if I can sing that monkey song for us.  I'm begging you, please.  It could actually be the difference between a job in New York and no job in New York.  Could you please sing the monkey song? 
[01:02:00]  I don't think so.  Come on, Claire.  Come on.  Come on, you remember us.  This is market one.  Numero una.  Not market 378.  Let's go, Claire.  Come on, Claire.  That's how New York is.  You've got to be on your feet.  On my feet.  Quick to the launching pad.  When someone says monkey song, you monkey song.  I forgot that line.  I forgot that line. 
[01:02:30]  When someone says monkey song, you monkey song.  Go back just a little bit.  Like, God, were we miserable.  If anyone else was in more pain than we were, we were happy.  Wow, that's funny.  Hold on.  Just going back a little more.  Just to set up.  All right.  How New York is, you've got to be on your feet.  On my feet.  Quick to the launching pad.  When someone says monkey song, you monkey song.  Now, let's hear the monkey song. 
[01:03:00]  How did it start?  I had a little monkey.  Come on, Claire.  Oh, come on.  You sing it for me.  Come on, Claire.  I don't remember the rest.  Please.  We're begging you.  I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  That's not the tune.  With the tune, Claire.  Go the full distance.  I had a little monkey.  His name was Tiny Tim.  I put him in the bathtub to teach him how to swim.  He drank up all the water.  He ate up all the soap.  He died last night with a bubble in his throat.  Oh, hey. 
[01:03:30]  She's quick on her feet.  That's what we're looking for in market numero uno.  I think you got something, Claire.  Why don't you guys conference us in about a half hour?  We'll work out the numbers.  All right.  We'll crunch some numbers.  Thanks.  Thank you, Claire.  Bye-bye.  That's something.  We'll work out the numbers.  Like that with the gig over the top. 
[01:04:00]  This is all stuff I've heard in my damn career.  We'll work out the numbers.  We'll work out the numbers.  Conference us.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Very funny.  The Randy and Claire show.  No Randy and Claire.  Now, if we could only find sticks, frankly.  Yeah, we're just going to take a quick break, and we're going to get Jim Cook in the studio  to join the little par-tay.  Jim from Hoboken says, stop giving Jeremy ideas.  You know, I would listen to Randy and Claire every day. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  What was that you said?  Lots of shopping events.  I thought you were Randy for a second.  All right.  Why don't we give something away?  Sure.  You guys didn't get it.  Let me see.  Ah, yes.  You Bunky song.  We got two pairs of tickets to see Monster Magnet and Buck Cherry April 16th.  Oh, Buck Cherry.  Buck Cherry.  What?  What?  At the Vanderbilt on Long Island.

Two random callers get the text.  212-757-1027.  Oh, ho, ho.  You're doing that?  Oh, ho.  Woo! 
[01:05:30]  What?  The part where it's just like, oh, who's this?  Oh, this is Claire.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  I was hoping to get, uh, I was, like, hoping to just talk to Randy.  Uh-oh.  We didn't like your part of it.  You don't even understand how real that is, though, Rick.  Happens all the time.  They break up teams all the time because they like one guy over the other.  Oh, ho.  And then the one guy will backstab his partner just to move up in market sizes.

No, no.  It was after we talked to Jim he got fired.  It was during when we were up there.  Oh, okay.  Remember?  Oh, for the little escapade on the general manager's couch.  Right.  Have they got the stains out yet?  No.  You were probably sitting on that couch.  Have you met Ken Stevens?  I did.  Oh, that's sweet.  You better check the back of your pants.

I wondered.  He was kind of glistening.  See?  On the midriff.  Yeah.  Once you get body glitter on you, as a guy, how do you go home and try to make up an excuse 
[01:08:30]  for it?  Because the only way it gets on you is body contact with a woman.  Right?  Yeah.  Well, you could say I started figure skating, honey.  And it's ice?  Yeah.  I'm thinking a body glitter beer from Sam Adams, where you drink it and kind of, you know,  oh, I spilled some of this new body glitter beer on me.  And then you'll give guys an excuse for coming home drunk with body glitter.  Yeah.  And I was hoping you would lick it off, honey.  Hey, where's your hops pipe?  Oh, I left it at the brewery. 
[01:09:00]  The puka.  The hookah.  The hookah.  The hookah.  I'm sure you ought to clean that out after Psycho Mike got done with that one.  We got some stories to tell.

The Opie and Anthony Show, a smorgasbord of Idiots 1027.  The Greatest Radio, that never hurts.  WCW.  Look who's in the studio, Anthony, our old pal, Jim Cook. 
[01:10:30]  Jim Cook.  Wearing his rocket beer pack.  It looks heavy, Jim.  It is.  We don't make a light beer.  Yeah.  He's already pouring the Sam Adams.  He got such a light, creamy head on top of my beer rope.  Huh?  It was popping up over the top of the glass.  And when you gently tap the side of the glass, the big, puffy head on the beer would jiggle  just like a perfect breast. 
[01:11:00]  Nice.  At a topless joint.  How's that for your next commercial?  I know if you stuck it down in a hurry.  Yes.  I put my whole mouth over it.  Yes.  It's so beautiful.  Jim, that would make a good commercial, right?  That would.  That would.  I'm a little scared, you know.  I think you guys are actually going to be our spokespeople.  Hey, that's right.  Yeah.  Fifteen years of trying to get respectability for beer in this country.  Screw that.  That didn't get anywhere.  I know.  Join the dark side.  Just come over to the talk side. 
[01:11:30]  Throwing it all overboard.  Hey, I had a conference call with your people today, Jim.  And I guess they were very, very uncomfortable about our Sex for Sam thing we did last year.  When it went down, I mean, everyone is cool now, but they were telling the story that,  you know, after the Sex for Sam, you want to explain Sex for Sam real fast?  Because we've got a lot of new listeners in.  Well, we had a bunch of couples.  I believe there were five couples that went out around the city with a list of very popular places in New York City. 
[01:12:00]  A couple of them were Tiffany, there was the Empire State Building, there was 30 Rock, Opie.  Just various places around the city, a theme restaurant.  Top of a double-decker bus.  Top of a double-decker bus, right.  Backseat of a cab.  Backseat of a cab.  Next to a homeless guy.  Next to a hot dog guy.  Hot dog thing in Central Park.  Just various places that are popular around New York City.  What they had to do when they got to these places was have sex.  When they did, it was confirmed, absolutely, by spotters that we had escorting each of the couples around. 
[01:12:30]  Like Ben and Rick and Psycho Mark.  And, of course, Psycho Mark, his last duty as an employee.  As a paid employee of this station.  And they would get points, point values for having sex in these places.  Having sex in Central Park, I believe, was relatively low.  Yeah, because you could just kind of hide behind a tree and stuff.  But then the top of a tour bus, very high.  Very high.  It was kind of rough to do. 
[01:13:00]  So the person that had the most points came with us up to Boston to the Sam Adams Brewery.  And hung out with us.  Right.  More than hung out.  And had sex up there at the brewery in front of Jim Cook while he's doing all the radio interviews.  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I was in the experience.  I'm talking to this station in Philadelphia.  And I'm looking out of the corner of my eye and it's like, I'm thinking, was that a snake?  That looked like a penis.  All at least smaller. 
[01:13:30]  And then all of a sudden, it disappeared.  I never thought I'd see the day we'd have to dump out of Jim Cook.  Dump out of Jim Cook.  From Sam Adams.  But, yes, Jim, you just described the act of sex.  Yes, and they were having it right there under the big top.  And, of course, Psycho Mark's couple had anal sex in the boss's office and was immediately fired.  Yes, Psycho Mark brought him in.  So I found out today that after we did that whole contest, because we were giving away trips to Boston, 
[01:14:00]  that representative from your company, everything's cool now, so I'm assuming we can talk about this,  was very uncomfortable by the concept to give away these trips to Boston with Sam Adams' name.  The three paternity suits.  Right.  Caused her a problem.  Yeah, there you go.  So one of the bigwigs in sales around here had to take the call, and he goes,  were you listening to the show when they came up with this idea that was not a Jim Cook impersonator in the studio? 
[01:14:30]  It was Jim himself.  That shut him up.  Yeah, it shut him up big time, because they're yelling and screaming like,  we can't be associated with that show and that concept and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And he shut him up, because you realize it was Jim in the studio developing that whole idea with the boys  when he came in for a little visit.  You're like that zany head of a company. 
[01:15:00]  Sometimes the employees can't believe you're in charge.  That's a good thing.  It's the nut in charge of the nut house.  Yeah, I don't even think he works.  You think he's a figurehead?  I think you're a figurehead.  I think you just walk around with the rocket beer pack, and people think that you're important.  It makes people happy.  It's my job.  What are your duties there at the brewery on a daily basis?  What do you think?  Well, let me put it this way.  I had to explain this to a guy over in England on the Fourth of July. 
[01:15:30]  My wife knows the English ambassador.  They love the holiday over there.  Yeah, they're real happy about it.  And they had a party at the ambassador's house.  And he knows my wife, and he was explaining to this sub-secretary of the exchequer what she did.  And she's basically trying to cure cancer.  She stores stem cells and treats leukemia and all this.  So he's going on and on about that.  And then the English guy turns to me and says,  And, sir, what do you do?  And I said, well, I try to help shy people have sex. 
[01:16:00]  So we've not been invited back.  Well, beer does that.  Well, I was just kidding.  But the English guy about swallowed his crumpet.  That was the last time we were invited back to the ambassador's house.  Now, we have an idea.  A lot of times when we have ideas, people get arrested, Jim.  But you've got to watch when you get either pulled over or something, not even for the beer. 
[01:16:30]  But he's always carrying some kind of zany herb with him.  And what do you got there?  That.  Yeah, we've been sprinkling this stuff on our pizza today.  What's this?  Uh-oh.  That is the grains of paradise.  Yeah.  From the Sam Adams Summer Ale.  Oh, please smell this for me.  I know.  Jim doesn't believe me when I say it smells like pot.  Let me just put it this way.  I gave it to Stinky.  He put it in his back pocket.  See?  He's like, thank you, man.  I'm going to have this later.  No, Stinky.  This is some kind of ingredient for beer.  It's not what you think.  Yeah, it's a member of the pepper.  It smells like, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  What does it smell like?  Pepper.  Pepper pot.  Pepper pot.  Ben, take a whiff.  Let's give it to an expert.  Uh-oh.  Stinky.  Stinky.  Take a whiff of that.  And tell me if it smells at all like marijuana.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  All right.  All right.  You've lost it.  I've been put down.  Right.  I haven't smoked pot in a very long time.  It's more like a pine tree.  A pine tree.  Oh, what have I done? 
[01:17:30]  He snorted.  Oh, yeah.  It's a pepper, man.  It's a very orchidaceous pepper.  He's trying to blow a snot around.  He hurt himself.  Why are you snorting the pepper?  I went to smell it.  It went on his nose and burned him.  You drink it.  You drink it.  It's like that old gag.  Hey, man.  I don't do coke.  I just smell it.  Oh, man.  Look, he is hurting.  It is strong.  You ever get that up your nose, Jim?  No, no, no.  You drink it.  Right.  I'll try it. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It used to be considered an aphrodisiac stinky.  Oh, there you go.  If you're on my leg in five minutes, you've got to get off.  Get off of your leg.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Of course.  I knew you meant that.  So what can we do with this stuff?  You can use it as a spice.  Yeah.  It's a very sort of aromatic member of the pepper family.  So it'll give you a nice pepper burn, but it's got almost an orchid-like smell.  Or you can use it in beer. 
[01:18:30]  You see him trying to explain that to the cops, though, when they pull it out of his pocket.  What's that?  Grains of paradise.  Let me tell you about it.  You're like, get in the car.  Hands behind your back.  Yeah, license and registration.  This is called crack.  All right, I'm fessing up.  Air officer, snort it.  See if that was mine.  We're debating if we should send Jim down the streets of New York with his rocket pack of beer.  Yeah.  Are you up for it, Jim?  Oh, sure. 
[01:19:00]  Give out some samples of Sam.  Why not?  He's on the stinky cam if you want to see what the rocket pack looks like.  By the way, I saw a snot rocket fly out of Stinky's nose over there.  I think it went to the rock and roll library.  Stinky, can you find your snot rocket?  I saw it.  It was a piece of pepper.  It was a big ball.  Yeah, but a chunk of it went up your nose?  Yeah.  Yeah, but it was a whole thing.  But it didn't just turn green because it was in your nose, too.  Because I saw something fly out.  No, that thing had a little parachute on it. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well, there's some.  Dan wants to say hi.  It's not the worst bodily fluid that'll be on that floor.  Dan wants to say hi to Jim Cook.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Jim, I don't know if you remember me, but you gave a personal tour of the brewery back  in November.  Yeah.  And I was the guy that came up to you.  It was right after Teen Week or whatever.  And I was the one that came up to you and talked to you about O&A.  Yes.  Do you recall that?  I do recall that.  I just want to call out and say thanks.  That was the best day of my life. 
[01:20:00]  We spent practically the entire day at that brewery.  And to be honest, I don't remember too much after about five or six o'clock.  After two weeks.  The brewery is a great tour in Boston.  But, I mean, getting there is another story.  Yeah.  It was my first time to Boston, and I thought it was going to be my last, to be honest with  you.  And Dan, you thought they didn't have any black people in Boston, huh?  Well, I was really surprised.  We put the brewery in a high-crime area and passed the savings on to you.  We want serious beer lovers. 
[01:20:30]  If somebody makes it to our brewery, they're like a pilgrim who comes to the Vatican.  You just know the locals aren't breaking into your brewery because they don't go for that.  No.  You don't make the 40s yet.  Well, we actually make a regular contribution to our local gang.  Well, that's good.  Yeah.  We're on good terms with them.  Hello?  Go gang.  King.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Jim, man.  I love your beer, man.  I stay having the six packs in the refrigerator and whatnot.  I have all of them. 
[01:21:00]  I love you, man.  Except for those seasonal ones that haven't came out yet.  And I need to know when you drop in the 40s, man.  There's not going to be Sam Adams in a 40.  But with Sam Adams, you don't need a 40.  Oh, I love you.  You know, 12 ounces, and you actually got some flavor.  Yes.  Don't wait for the 40.  But we do have it in kegs.  So, you can do that.  Yeah, man.  But you need 40s, man.  We only drink 40s in the town, though.  Well, get a six pack and think of it as a 72.  All right, then, man. 
[01:21:30]  Stay up, man.  I love you, King.  All right, then.  He's got all the beer junk.  72.  That's good.  All right.  Let me go to Jeff.  Jeff, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Jeff.  Hey.  You.  Hey, buddy.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Well, we're having a gym.  Hey, Jim, how are you doing?  I'm doing great.  Terrific.  Listen, I just want to let you guys know, you guys are like Merlin the Magician.  I tell you, you promised it for two weeks, and sure enough, it's WOW Wednesday.  Well, that's...  First one of the season. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, that's tomorrow.  But you got WOW today?  Oh, I got WOW just now.  Nice.  Let me tell you, we do concentrate a lot on a Wednesday for WOW, but it is really whip  them out whenever.  It's whenever.  It's a nice day out, yeah.  Yeah.  I couldn't believe it.  I've had my sticker on all winter, and I've been sitting down, everybody's wearing clothes,  nobody's having anything coming out.  But no, it's a wonderful world to move.  The WOW season officially kicks off tomorrow, something we started in Boston.  Jim remembers those days, and we're going to take over the city once again.  We're going to get on live TV and all that stuff. 
[01:22:30]  We'll explain it all tomorrow, but make sure you get your WOW stickers.  All right?  All right.  I want to ask Jim one quick question.  Yeah.  Sure.  Why are you giving that stuff the stinky to smell?  He wouldn't know good weed if you handed him something labeled Dank Bud from something  that's labeled Brick Dirt.  I thought it resembled pot in the smell.  No.  See, Anthony's been off the weed way too long.  Is that what it is?  I'm going to try to smell it stinky.  Let me see what happens now.  I'll be careful.  Yeah.  There is something kind of pot smelling in it. 
[01:23:00]  I'm going to try it.  Come on.  It's kind of piney.  It's like the old four-finger lids I used to pick up.  I'm going to try to work with you.  It looks like all the seeds.  Work with me.  It looks like all the seeds from your weed.  Right.  Just kind of smell it.  Tell me if there's anything in there that would be in the crease of your Yes album.  Right.  When you're cleaning out your pot.  I would love to agree with you.  Oh, my God.  All right.  I smell the pine, though.  Get me some real pot, then, stinky, and see if we can compare it. 
[01:23:30]  I was thinking we'd have it, of course.  Don't have any.  Of course he doesn't.  That's against policy to have narcotics on company property.  I don't have any because Mommy's listening.  Now, remember the hookah when we went up to Boston?  Jim had a huge hookah that was being passed around to all the various radio stations that  were broadcasting up there, and we would smoke the hops.  Now, the hops taste great in the hookah, and you do get this very short, euphoric buzz from 
[01:24:00]  it.  Yeah.  It was nice.  Yeah.  Psycho Mark was there with us, as you remember.  Yes.  I think he had something different in mind than the hops, and he took a huge bud out of his  baggie, put it in the hookah, and six or so people were smoking pot from your hookah.  Well, it went further than that.  I was out of our crew alone.  Then, somebody took the hookah, and it started being passed around to the various radio stations 
[01:24:30]  with a little bit of hops on top of the real pot, and they were smoking it.  We got the entire broadcast facility.  How many owned that day?  Yeah.  How many stations were there, Jim?  Fifty.  From all over the world.  You had guys from Australia, Canada, Germany.  They weren't ready for this.  This is amazing hops, let me tell you.  I'm astounded about Jesus.  I knew Sam Adams used good hops, but I'm ready to wrestle a crocodile. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah.  That was something when Psycho Mark did that.  And you could tell, because when the hops were burning, you smelt the hops, and it  was nice.  Psycho Mark put that weed in there.  The waft of pot fume that went around the entire tent.  They finally confiscated it.  They took it away.  They took it away from everyone, and then...  Look at the Psycho Mark.  We were getting dirty looks.  Thank God he was fired.  And then our visit ended when we had an interview with Darbukonger. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And we made her cry.  And she ran off.  But she'd kill to be on the show now, see?  Yeah.  See?  We were trying to give her a little boost and everything, and then she just faded away.  Now, you know who we've got this year?  Who?  Ben Affleck.  Oh, Ben Affleck.  Oh, very cool.  Another Boston guy.  Because he's a Boston guy.  Yep.  Yep.  So don't make him cry.  You would...  You actually got him.  Yeah.  To do this.  Yep.  Yep.  Wow.  We've got a project with him and Matt Damon to... 
[01:26:00]  Who?  Another Boston guy.  Of course.  Two Boston guys to pick a movie script.  And they're making a TV show out of it.  And then the movie's actually going to be produced.  It's a contest type thing.  Yeah, it's done.  So somebody actually sent a script in?  10,000 people.  Yeah.  What happens is there's a website, right?  Yeah.  There's a website, and you send in your script for a movie, and then they pick the best one?  Yep.  Yep.  And then they produce it as a film, right? 
[01:26:30]  They just did it.  Yeah.  So they picked it.  A guy from Chicago that was working in a warehouse wrote a script, and he's now got a million bucks  to direct a movie.  How cool is that?  Wow.  Yeah.  Damn.  So, anyway, Affleck will be there.  Nice deal.  Don't make him cry.  Don't make him cry.  I call him Ben.  I call him Benny.  Benny Affleck?  You call him that?  Benny A.  Benny A.  We've got to get good guests for you guys.  Hey.  That's pretty good.  O&A.  Yeah.  No, you guys rock.  I've got a question for Jim. 
[01:27:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Jim, once I tried your white ale, and I haven't been able to find it anywhere.  It was like the best beer that I've ever tasted, and I couldn't find it anywhere.  Yeah, what happened with the white ale from Sam Adams, Jim?  Well, after I tripped in the Turks and Caicos, ran out.  We ran out, and we meant to make it just for, you know, that spring.  Oh, you've got to bring that back.  That was one of those specialty brews.  Yeah.  So, am I going to be able to see it ever again?  God willing.  Try the summer ale. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, the summer ale.  I tried them all.  Summer ale rocks.  Yeah, summer ale has a lot of the same flavors.  Yep.  The grains of paradise was in the white ale, too.  How many white ales did we drink?  I swear to God.  Yeah, we all went.  We did a Sam Adams broadcast from Turks and Caicos about, I guess, four years ago.  Yeah.  Three, four years ago.  And you brought how much beer down there?  We brought about 500 cases.  500 cases of beer.  For this little island.  For maybe 100 people. 
[01:28:00]  It was, yeah, it was ridiculous, the beer to people ratio.  And I know myself, I had a bottle of beer in my hand 24 hours a day.  Five days straight.  Because I really didn't sleep much.  And when I did, I fell asleep drinking.  So I had the beer in my hand.  And then when you woke up, you just kind of, yeah, Lulu.  And I just kind of, like, started drinking in the morning really quick.  Yeah.  We had the Sam Adams backstage pass, remember it?  Yeah, that was it, too. 
[01:28:30]  We didn't need drink tickets or anything.  We had this VIP pass.  So we walked up to the bar and just went, here you go.  Showed them the pass, boom.  You got a white ale.  And, my God, I don't think I drank that much beer in my life.  And it was always fun every morning to wake up.  Beautiful sunrise over the water.  You got your white ale.  And look down at the beach and see Jim Cook staggering down the beach with his own white ale.  At whatever hour of the morning it was.  I'd wake up.  And he'd be drinking already. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  Excuse me, I'm a brewer.  This is my job.  It's quality control.  We were laughing one day.  And we're broadcasting.  And there's Jim Cook walking down the beach.  You got your shorts on.  You got your beer.  You're just looking around.  And me and I looked at each other.  There is the head muckety-muck of Sam Adams.  And you look over and wave.  This beer, you know, is I'm not curing cancer.  That's right.  Very good. 
[01:29:30]  Sean.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  I just wanted to say how great Sam Adams is.  God love you.  You are a genius.  Let's beer out.  And I've never been told up.  You listen to the right radio station.  You drink good beer.  What more is there?  And also, Jim, you're one of the best guests on the show.  It's always a riot.  I love having Jim on.  That says something about the show.  But that's not true.  It's always a riot.  You know what sucks, Sean?  We had some girls that were supposed to come down. 
[01:30:00]  And they had to cancel, unfortunately.  But the girls from that Boyer house that we had on a couple months ago, we were going  to have them down and get naked.  What happened?  If you bring up the beers, I'm sure you'll get a lot of girls showing up.  Yeah, I guess we got free Sam Adams for any girl that shows up topless today.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Nice.  Oops.  Uh-oh.  You didn't hand signals from the person.  She wasn't drinking the right beer.  Yes, we're dead serious, ladies. 
[01:30:30]  Jim appreciates a nice rack with his beer.  Who doesn't?  Come on.  Oh, thank you, Jim.  Once again, look at the head.  Watch.  Watch when I do the wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  See, it's like, bye-bye-bye-bye.  There's that nice, creamy head.  Ken Stevens is walking around outside.  He feels like a boob.  Does he want his Sam Adams beer?  Or is he going to make believe that he's not drinking the beer with us today?  Oh, he's your general manager, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's a figurehead, too.  Good. 
[01:31:00]  He's not really the boss.  You guys got a lot in common.  You don't do much.  Yeah.  Ken.  Oh, hi, Ken.  Hey, Ken.  All right.  You want to see an example of broadcasting under the influence?  Ken, normally it's against company policy to consume a beer, right?  But this is a very...  There's a beer consumption going on here, isn't it?  Absolutely not.  This is a very important client.  But it's a client.  And see, so as long as the station's making some money...  Right.  Yeah.  Some of these things kind of...  Yeah, you can tell your boss...  The sponsor made me do it.  You can pretend to drink it. 
[01:31:30]  That's what I'm doing.  I'm faking it.  Ken, if it makes you feel better, we're drinking TV beers.  Yeah.  You know how they do it on TV.  Looks like the real thing, but it's illegal.  It's just a...  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  There you go.  So drink that root beer.  Theater of the mind.  That's a big head, huh?  Well, he's the president.  He knows what a big head looks like.  Do you like the head on that?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Kind of...  Whoa.  Look, he took a big one.  And he's got some on his nose now.  How do you get that? 
[01:32:00]  There you go.  Got beer mustache.  Tastes like...  Almost like real beer.  Sure.  Very close to it.  Very close, right?  No, it's not.  Of course.  No.  It's against all company policy.  No.  You know, that done.  So did you finish your story about the 500 cases of beer on the island?  Oh.  Was there more to that?  No, we were just drinking beer all the time on the island.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we finished.  Why, Ken?  Are we doing that again?  I just wondered.  Are we?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Have you got any trips planned that we can go on?  You guys got to come to the brewery again. 
[01:32:30]  Well, that's a given.  We want to...  Brewery's good, but, you know, Boston or the Caribbean, hmm.  Let me think.  Let me scratch my head.  Don't get us wrong.  We appreciate a free trip to the ghetto of Boston, but, you know.  Say hi to Melissa, Ken.  Oh, my God.  Holy cow.  Oh, man.  You guys want to be fired again?  You know, you guys are going to be in Syracuse.  You just saw the look.  Man.  I thought he was okay with that little story. 
[01:33:00]  Come on.  Oh, man.  What?  It's all in good fun, right?  Yeah.  Next time I'm on your show, it's going to be in Binghamton.  That look just proved it.  He's definitely having that affair.  Oh, no.  I thought you were going to say it proved that he's not.  Mm-mm.  Mm-mm.  Did you think it was right when the door was shut?  He was like...  All right.  Speaking of Ken Stevens and Jim Cook, we found a little piece of tape when Psycho Mark got  fired.  I don't think we've played this in a really long time, right? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Right, Rick.  Easy.  Put that down.  So, here's the setup.  We did the sex for Sam.  Mm-mm.  Um, and Psycho Mark's couple had anal sex on the boss's couch.  Ken Stevens, who was just in here.  It was sanctioned by Psycho Mark.  And that couch is still in the office.  Still there.  And it's now a running joke within the Sam Adams organization.  Yeah.  I found that on that couch.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  This is how it all went down, because the office was locked. 
[01:34:00]  Yep.  I think on the list of sex places, this was like a high ticket.  Yeah, it was the winner.  This was like 100 points or something like that.  This was huge.  This was just a normal 10-pointer.  10.  Yeah.  That's all it was worth.  Did they get double for...  They got the three-point conversion.  They got the two-point anal conversion.  Oh, it was two points?  Yeah.  It should have been three.  So, this is it.  Psycho Mark, his last duties here at N.E.W.  Hold on a second, though, Anthony. 
[01:34:30]  Lisa?  Hi.  How are you?  Hey.  I was actually...  I was calling because I wanted to come down, and I don't know if you guys remember me from  a while ago, but I'm the corn on the cob girl.  Corn on the cob girl.  Corn on the cob girl, man.  I was really stoned, and I said I wanted to be stuck on corn on the cob.  You want to suck on a corn on the cob?  Yeah.  When, um, this is when Stinky was going away on some...  Hold on.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  She was a stripper that wanted to come with me to Mississippi. 
[01:35:00]  You don't know.  She'd bring the corn on the cob pipe.  Ah.  All right.  A pipe?  It's not good.  Well, Lisa, come on down, all right?  Yeah.  Come down, and we'll sort it all out while you're topless.  You show us your rack.  You get a free glass of Sam Adams.  No problem.  All right.  Is that the corn?  Uh, yeah.  One per each.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Let me get...  On our way.  Psycho Mark is checking us.  Yes, Psycho Mark.  Rick's full of crap.  It wasn't 10 points.  It was 50 points for the office.  No, it wasn't.  I think if you listen to the papers... 
[01:35:30]  No, it wasn't, because if you listen to it back, all you had up until that point was  like 210 points, or 212, and then you finished up with 224.  Well, tell Ken I would have done it for free.  See you later.  He is a pisser, man.  God.  He is such a pisser.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going to play...  How can I have told him...  I'm going to play the Psycho Mark tape in a second here.  Jackie, the knife girl. 
[01:36:00]  What's up?  Hi, Jackie.  It's been a while.  Yeah, it has.  Jackie got arrested for our show, Jim.  Yeah.  And she loves knives.  I can't get up there today.  It's too far away.  Well, where are you?  I'm in Jersey.  You bada bing?  I live in South Jersey.  I live in the middle of nowhere.  It takes two hours, at least.  All right.  Well, you're not going to get your free beer today.  Yeah.  I know.  That's what sucks.  I guess it's...  We're offering it to the ladies that are in the area.  Right.  If you're in the area, come down.  Jim himself will pour you a creamy-headed Sam-Am out of his Beer Rocket pack. 
[01:36:30]  All right, Jim.  I'm going to cry.  See, you could meet Jim.  I can't make it.  Do you want to rub some knives all over your body for Jim?  Sure.  Any day.  See, that would have ruled.  This girl...  Wow.  Jim...  Anytime you guys want me to come back, I will.  Picture this.  I have a new number for Rick if you want to...  All right, hold on.  I will hold on, and Rick will get it.  She lays down, right?  She gets some guy with knives. 
[01:37:00]  Sharp steak knives.  The big bread knives.  And the guy gently drags the blade against her body.  Not the side, not the back, not the handle.  The serrated blade of a very sharp knife.  And this girl proceeds to go off like a volcano.  She loves it.  She loves it, Kelman.  Now, she loves it.  Come here.  I'm going to take you and drag blades across your throat.  She sounds dangerous. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She had a lot of trouble.  And she got arrested on the voyeur bus for one of the troops.  What'd she get arrested for?  Some kind of nudity.  Giuliani.  The president of the United States was involved.  It was something very big.  Yeah, we leave the mayors alone, and we went right to the president.  But the mayor got involved again.  Yeah, the mayor got involved.  Zoe, or Zoe, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Who's this?  Is this them?  Yeah.  Is this you?  Yeah.  Cool.  Yeah, I'm in the city for a change.  I live out in Fort Jefferson. 
[01:38:00]  All right.  I live out on the island, and I don't know.  I don't really want any beer, but what do I have to do?  Like, show me my breasts?  Yeah.  All right.  Come on down.  Show Jim your rack.  You don't want any beer?  Oh, that's right.  Be a beer man.  All right.  Okay.  Where are you guys located?  You hold on right now, and Rick will tell you.  There you go.  Girls coming down to get their free beer from Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  Nice.  Here's the tape of Psycho Mark.  Getting fired.  That's all you need to say.  Let's see.  And Jim, it was all your fault.  Yeah.  Oh, no. 
[01:38:30]  No.  Come on.  That can't be true.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark, where are you?  Take it.  I'm actually right down the hall.  You're right down the hall.  I'm in Kent Stevens' office.  No, stop it.  It's really good.  How did you get into the boss's office?  Believe it or not, the Canada lady was walking down the hall.  No way.  I grabbed your master key, so let me ask.  Get out of here.  We're in here right now.  It's locked, but you can't get out of here.  Wait, wait, wait.  Get out of here.  Wait.  Spaz is running in.  Jeremy's giving me the no. 
[01:39:00]  Spaz is running in to confirm.  I ran down there.  She's hiking up this street.  I ran down there.  Jeremy's going to kick your ass off.  Jeremy's so mad.  He's just nodding his head.  He's standing at the door.  He's nodding his head like, no.  No score.  Do it.  Just go ahead.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  He went to the door.  Ouch.  Oh, my God.  He's just going to kick it out.  Wait a minute.  Psycho Mark, is there anal going on in Kim Stevens' office? 
[01:39:30]  Oh, stop.  Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We're done.  We're done.  That's it.  Well, even though we will probably get in huge trouble for this, you've got to give them  the 12 points.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  We're in huge trouble.  I'm so happy.  I'm so happy.  I'm fired.  Oh, yes, I am.  I'm dead.  Oh, no.  He's pumped.  I'm dead.  It looks like I'm a wreck.  No.  I'm dead. 
[01:40:00]  Well, that was good for 12 points and a Psycho Mark's job.  No, that's 50 points, dude.  That's 50 points.  No, that was...  That's a 50 point.  Wait.  Here comes Psycho Mark.  That was 10 points.  Wait, Psycho Mark.  We're fired.  What's this wee stuff like, man?  I'm fired.  What happened?  We didn't know you were going for the boss's office.  You guys said that.  You guys said it was...  So what happened?  You got into Ken's office.  I was in the office. 
[01:40:30]  Jeremy was there and he was nodding his head.  No.  And then he told me I'm dead.  I can't believe there was anal in our boss's office.  Get out of here.  I'm so dead.  No, that was good for 12 points.  No.  Only 10 points for the office.  But there's 223 points.  Coach, you guys said...  Oh, my God.  No.  It wasn't on the couch.  You were too.  I got a witness.  It was going to be my job.  It was on the couch.  Oh, my God. 
[01:41:00]  We're going to have to talk Jeremy down from this.  I didn't know you were going to go for the Ken Stevens' conversion.  Yeah, we absolutely didn't know you were going to do the Ken Stevens' conversion.  What are you, insane?  That's the big boss's office.  There's a list over here of all kinds of locations you could have gone to.  What you guys said.  I thought we waved off that location as you guys were leaving the building.  No one told me.  You guys said that was a fair location. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, my God.  You guys said the couch.  50 points for the couch.  So, what happened?  You guys were inside and Jeremy was looking in?  Because there's a huge glass office.  He is looking in as if it was death rays.  Don't worry, Psycho Mark.  Soon you'll be getting effed in that office, too.  All right, then.  We've got to take a break.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't stick to.  I don't think it's a problem.  I don't know.  He's back. 
[01:42:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  We're hanging with Jim Cook from Sam Adams today.  Having a lot of fun.  Reminiscing a little bit.  He's got his rocket pack filled with beer.  Yeah.  Girls are starting to show up to show off their rack for a free glass of beer.  Eventually, we'll get Jim on the street from New York with his rocket pack of beer. 
[01:42:30]  Let's start hanging out around the building.  We'll come down in a little while, right, eh?  Yes.  Let's go to Steve.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Sorry.  Let me turn this down.  We're hanging with Jim Cook.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Steve.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a question for Jim.  Yeah.  Listen, man.  Whatever happened to Triple Box?  It's still out there.  You just got to work to find it.  Really? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Man, I used to be getting that in Jersey all the time.  Nobody carries it anymore.  Well, look.  You got to look for it because a 35-proof beer is something unique.  Now, Old Dirty drank up all of it that we had here in New York.  But you can still find it in North Jersey.  So ask them.  Go into a store.  Say, you got any of that 35-proof beer?  And it's still legal in a lot of states, right?  Yeah.  12 states is still legal.  12 states will not even sell it.  Nice.  Not even legal.  I'm working on 15.  That's funny because I live in North Jersey and just ain't finding it. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  Well, let me send some back down there.  Sweet.  All right.  God love you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah.  That stuff is like, oof.  Yeah.  That's the rocket fuel.  I should put that in the backpack next time.  Yeah.  We'd get more than racks in here.  Yeah.  It would get a little ugly.  Anthony, I'm a little distracted because Ben got a phone message from Limo Anthony. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  What is this about?  Ben's going to explain this.  This tool, a.k.a. Anthony, calls the other day, and I'm sitting here running the board  while you guys are wiped, and he calls complaining that we don't give him his WWF tickets.  So I'm like, you know, whatever, Anthony.  Did we promise him WWF?  No, we always give him to him, but he's a pain in the ass.  He's got to call 25 times to remind me.  I always set aside a pair of tickets for him, right?  So then Steve and I just started screwing with him.  I pretended I was Mark and told him to come in and say he picked me up. 
[01:44:30]  Yada, yada.  He got really offended and then left the next morning at 8 in the morning and left this message  on my machine like a little crybaby.  Listen to the message.  He's a baby.  Yo, douchebag, I was really seriously calling you yesterday.  If you don't want to hang out, that's fine.  I don't give a f*** about that.  I want my WWF tickets.  I hope he's not getting picked up from the airport on Sunday from Turks and Caicos.  So that's the deal.  So you better give me a call.  Get your head out of your ass.  What is he thinking? 
[01:45:00]  We give the wrestling tickets to him as a little gesture of thank you.  Yeah, he likes to bring his son, so I give him the tickets.  And that's how he acts, because he didn't get his wrestling tickets.  Yeah, well, and they're not even in yet.  They come right before the event.  So you've got to watch them.  They come right before the event.  But he calls.  He calls me all the time.  But he's just going on and on.  I kept hanging up on him.  And he's pissed off because, what, he wanted to hang out with you?  No, he goes, why don't we hang out?  I live in Manhattan.  I don't want to go to Long Island.  And I was just joking with him.  He gets all offended, you know, because he has no friends or whatever. 
[01:45:30]  So now, you know, now he's not going to pick you up.  That was his threat.  And I got in at like 3.30 in the morning.  Oh, boy.  We should straighten this out with him.  Can we get him on the line?  What?  What the hell?  Why is he insane like that?  Ben's writing something down.  Oh, you got his number.  Okay.  We'll get him on.  In the meantime, we also got to check in with Black Earl.  Earl.  Earl, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  We're in the WOW van at Fifth Avenue in Washington Square North. 
[01:46:00]  We'll be handing out WOW stickers.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, that sounds just like Staten Island.  What happened?  Weren't you supposed to do Staten Island Ferry today?  The entrance to the ferry was completely quartered off.  It's a mess down there.  So we just headed back up.  What do you mean, a mess?  They would not let cars into that entrance, the main entrance.  Why?  I don't know.  There's something heavy going down.  Something heavy going down, Opie. 
[01:46:30]  Something heavy.  In the street talk.  So you figured, what the hell, instead of handing out WOW stickers to commuters back to Staten Island,  I'll hand them out to the drug pushers and the homeless people in the park.  Actually, it's a great crowd here in the park, and all the NYU students are just getting out of class.  All right.  All right, so you're giving out the WOW stickers, getting ready for WOW tomorrow?  Yes, sir.  Speech.  Earl, you all right?  Earl, liven it up, man.  Stop the weed smoking.  You all right, Opie?  Yeah, you hear him?  I have a cold, guys.  Sorry. 
[01:47:00]  You got some cold?  I have a cold.  Have a cold?  Guys, I'm sure Washington's been running.  Okay?  I don't know.  I don't know how much stickers we got.  The WOW band here is going to be fantastic.  I think it's a stand-up fan because of something big going down.  Earl.  Yes.  You sound like you're a beaten man.  I'm not a beat.  I've got this cold.  It's been kicking my butt for a week.  Are you insulted because we're starting to call you Coco Earl?  No, not at all. 
[01:47:30]  I want Earl to change his name to Coco Beware.  I walk around with a little parrot on his shoulder.  We're having big fun down here today.  Give me a little bit of a stick.  Earl.  And coughing.  I'll cough on your stick or I'll give you my virus.  You all right, Earl?  I'm fine.  I just have a slight cold.  That's all.  A slight cold.  Hey, Earl, I'm glad you called.  What do you think of Reverend Al going to Africa?  I think it's a cold day.  Have you heard this story? 
[01:48:00]  No, I have not.  Jim, you hear about Reverend Al?  No.  He's very big here in New York, of course.  And Reverend Al Sharpton is going to Africa, to the Sudan, on a mission of mercy.  There's a slave trade going on over there.  People are actually enslaved.  They are bought and sold.  It's a black-on-black slavery.  And Reverend Al, very upset about this, is doing something about it.  He is going there.  He is buying slaves. 
[01:48:30]  And then setting them free.  Where is he setting them free, though?  In my house.  Yeah.  You're free to clean my windows, wax my floors and vacuum them, and cook me dinner.  And don't make me any of that zebra burger.  But they got nice beef that I can make for you.  Earl, is that true?  Yes.  It's very true.  Yes.  Where is he going to set them free, though?  I'm not really sure, but I do know that the State Department told him not to go. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, a lot of people against this.  And, you know, the thing is, you set something free, it's just going to get roped in again.  He could buy these slaves, but if they don't take them out of the area, they're just going to get taken up into slavery again.  But let's be realistic here.  When you watch something like Roots and watch a slavery movie, it ain't like that.  The people that are enslaved are not sitting there in the little house with, you know, Kunta Kinte and stuff and dreaming of freedom or whatever. 
[01:49:30]  Maybe they're dreaming of freedom, but they are like friggin' morons.  What are you going to do?  You're going to free the slaves.  Now start your job at IBM.  These people have only known slavery.  And get the prices, Opie.  They're pretty reasonable.  The rate for a healthy woman or child is about 50 bucks.  50 bucks?  I could swing it, give me a dozen.  Reverend Al. 
[01:50:00]  And how is he buying slaves with Stephen Bagonis' money?  The guy has not paid Stephen Bagonis for that whole Tawana Brawley incident.  He's just going to get some slaves.  I'm buying me some slaves.  And you can order your own slave from reverendal.com, my website.  You get a free hubcap medallion to put around his neck, like the Thrall episode of Star Trek, so they know not to get away.  And it has a shocker thing.  When you press a button, it shocks your slaves. 
[01:50:30]  Much like the Thrall episode of Star Trek.  I want to be called Reverend Massa.  Now, that's my name, Reverend Massa.  Reverend Al is going into the Sudanese desert.  He's going to be accompanied by some international and Swiss-based organizations that have done this in the past.  They buy the slaves and free them.  And he's going to buy up a bunch of slaves. 
[01:51:00]  And a lot of people are saying this is very, very dangerous.  Because the area, there's some kind of a Muslim war going on there, a Christian-Muslim war.  And the Muslims enslave the Christians.  And Reverend Al, 50 bucks.  Wouldn't you buy a child for 50 bucks as opposed to a woman?  Get a few more years.  Yeah, you get some more years.  Out of your investment.  All right, one woman, and then you buy two children.  And then you rotate.  Once the woman gets a little older.  Come here, let me check your teeth.  Oh, God. 
[01:51:30]  You.  Let me check your teeth.  Let me check them thigh muscles.  You look like a big old buck.  You're well worth the pivoted buck.  And with every slave, the Reverend Al also includes Slave Jack.  So your Negroes can't run away because you can track them down with Slave Jack.  Reverend Al.  Anthony, I've got to interrupt you for a minute. 
[01:52:00]  Yes, yes, Opie.  Limo, Anthony is calling, but he's in a meeting.  He's in a meeting?  What kind of meeting is he in?  Anthony, what kind of meeting are you in?  I'm talking business.  What's up?  You're on a car phone.  You're in a car.  Yeah, but I've got a meeting going on in my car.  Like we couldn't tell he's in a car.  I get a wind-winded vibe.  At least roll the windows up, you lying.  Say hi to Jim Cook.  Hello, Jim Cook.  I'll tell you.  Jim Cook, how can I fit Vital Limousine into your plug?  Jim Cook from Sam Adams. 
[01:52:30]  He's giving everyone free beer.  Oh, great.  Did I have some?  And you know what?  He's getting one big, giant, entertaining commercial on our show, and we didn't have  to throw darts at him.  We'll explain that to Jim a little later.  Oh, and what's going on?  Yeah, what's your problem, man?  What?  Me?  Yeah, you left a nasty message with Ben.  Oh, you know, we'll talk about that off the air.  Um, no.  No, we won't.  No, yes, please.  Guys, not now.  We have to. 
[01:53:00]  You beat me out of nowhere.  Why?  Who's in your car with you?  My friend Barry.  You're sure you're not transporting Melissa back to the airport so she can get back to  Philly?  No.  All of a sudden, spots start appearing on the show.  What is going on?  Listen, man, you left this message with Ben.  You're a douchebag.  I was really seriously calling you yesterday.  If you don't want to hang out, that's fine.  I don't give a f*** about that.  I want my WWF tickets. 
[01:53:30]  I hope he's not getting picked up from the airport on Sunday from Turks and Caicos.  That's the deal.  So you better give me a call.  Get your head out of your ass.  Because it's only when he wants, you know, when...  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Let's slow down.  Oh, here we go.  Let's slow down.  What...  Why the...  Why the anger?  What the hell were you thinking?  The anger was...  Bottom line is, you know with those guys, whenever, you know...  What's those guys?  Hold on.  Who are you calling those guys? 
[01:54:00]  Never mind.  No, mind.  No.  Explain yourself.  You're calling Ben those guys?  No.  What happens is, Ben always turns to me and goes,  Well, I'm not asking for anything.  They are.  And it's like he's doing me a favor when I ask him for the tickets.  I...  I...  Wait a minute.  Can I finish?  And I have an open forum with you, Hope.  What?  And you've always told me just to call Ben and that was it, correct?  Yeah, because I don't want to deal with you.  All right, fine.  You don't have to deal with me.  So...  Oh, Jim just saw Darvick Conger in his peripheral vision. 
[01:54:30]  The rivers of mascara are running.  All right.  Every time I call Ben, he says to me,  Oh, he says, well, you know, I don't ask you for anything.  Like, he's doing me a favor.  That's not fair.  All right, limo, Anthony.  First of all, we give you wrestling tickets for you and your son, right?  Correct.  That is like...  That's kind of like a privilege.  It's something we do.  Like, here, Anthony, take these fine wrestling tickets and have fun with your son, right?  Yeah.  That's correct, but I don't ask that often. 
[01:55:00]  But now you're assuming that you should get them all the time.  You're like saying, where's my damn wrestling ticket?  Now it's a right, not a privilege.  What happened?  Um, you guys were using me a lot and I just wanted to know if I could go.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, right.  Opie, you know, it's...  I use you a lot?  Not you, Bill.  I think I've...  By the way, she gave me the wrong day that you were coming in, by the way.  Uh, whatever, but I think I've... 
[01:55:30]  I think you, uh, drove me once in the last year, right?  About four or five times.  I think you're a lying scumbag.  Thank you.  Now, what's the deal with you wanting to hang out with Ben?  You're insulted because Ben didn't want to hang out with you.  Because I told Ben, we'll go down to Fire Island one day, Flynn's.  My friend owns Flynn's.  And I wanted to know if he wanted to go one day.  And he just, like, blew me off like I was nothing.  And he's like, ah, we don't want to hang out with you.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Yeah, Fire Island is, like, for gay people.  It's not gay. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  Not that part.  Not that part.  Not that grain of sand.  Now, what's wrong with gay people?  You have a problem with them, too?  Of course they have a kid.  Why are you doing this to me?  All right, now, the real reason why we called.  Why are you on every single radio show here at WNAW?  I am not.  Well, wait.  Radio Ahua.  I'm not trying to be.  They called me.  Oh, they called you, Dick.  What shows have you been on?  I see your lying scumbag.  What shows have you been on in the last week here at WNAW? 
[01:56:30]  Personally, I haven't been on.  They've plugged Vital on Ron and Fez for that psycho girl for a date.  Uh-huh.  And the sports guys, when Maddie Moonshine was getting drunk, they needed a call home.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That's it.  I have not been on my personal.  I haven't even listened to the radio since you guys went on vacation.  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Yeah, thanks for the support.  We appreciate it.  What, you don't like the reruns?  I like the reruns.  I heard, you know.  We replayed the segment with you getting darts in the back. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, great.  It's a black day of my life.  Jim, this guy likes plugs and stuff?  Oh, jeez.  Tell Jim, man.  Yes, Anthony loves getting his limo company plugged on the air.  Loves it.  Yes.  And he likes being...  Loves it so much that he's now doing it on other radio.  On other shows.  That's not fair, Opie.  They called me.  So don't do that.  Don't create some kind of war.  Because they called me.  A war.  All for free.  Right.  All right, go ahead, Ed.  Yeah, so he was in one day. 
[01:57:30]  And we promised to give him ten plugs.  Yeah.  Ten plugs.  Ten plugs.  For every dart we throw in his back that sticks.  So we got darts.  We sharpened them up real nice.  Protected his spine.  Even though, Anthony, he would never know where it was.  Thanks, Anthony.  Shut up.  And we then threw darts in his back.  One stuck very nicely.  And he bled.  Very nicely. 
[01:58:00]  He bled.  No, I did not only bleed.  I lost feeling in my arm for half the evening coming home.  Too long.  Poor baby.  Man, I'm glad all I have to do is bring beer.  Yeah.  Jim, of course we would never ask you to do stuff like that.  Never.  You're very important to our radio show.  Thank God.  I'm not, Jim.  As you notice, I've been with them for two and a half years.  They hate me.  I know.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  So what are you saying to me, Opie?  Are you mad at me because they're calling me and I've gone on? 
[01:58:30]  I won't.  Well, here's the deal.  Anthony has decided.  Anthony has decided or just decided?  Anthony, first of all, do you even know where Jim Cook is from?  Yeah, she's from Sam Adams.  There's another plug.  Three left.  Three left.  Come back.  They got more darts.  You've got three plugs left.  Nailed them.  I'm hanging up the phone.  I have one left.  I love nailing them on that. 
[01:59:00]  Limo Inn, we don't think it's a good idea that you've been whoring yourself out to other  radio shows here.  You don't hear Jim Norton on other shows or Dice.  That's not true.  That's not true.  Or Brian Regan.  Right.  Brian Regan.  Who else?  Stalker Patty.  Well, Stalker Patty, whatever.  That's a lost call.  What are you saying?  Are you fading me out?  What?  Well, sure.  Yeah, you're going to do all these shows.  I don't know.  We like loyalty. 
[01:59:30]  Well, you know what?  You know, we hear you on things like Sports Guys.  We like the Sports Guys.  But you've got to understand.  We can't have people on all these other shows.  It kind of makes it like we're not special.  Well, that's not my fault.  And I've asked permission from Opie in the past to be able to do something.  And he said it on the air.  I don't care what you do.  You've outgrown us.  So would you like your three last plugs before we hang out? 
[02:00:00]  No.  I will save them.  For what?  For another show?  They're void after today.  Right.  So you guys are basically telling me that's it.  So after two and a half years of sweating, spending money, and doing whatever I had to do for you guys, I'm done.  Yeah, that's a good way to actually think about it.  Well, I'll go out in a fury, right?  You said it better than us.  So you want to get your plugs in before it's over?  That's all right, bro.  I'll save them.  For what? 
[02:00:30]  Maybe for another lifetime.  Another lifetime.  Yep.  All right.  Well, you can get those plugs on the sports guys and Ron and Fez and the radio chicks.  Opie, you know they called me and you know I asked you.  Hell, even Don and Mike.  Two people will hear that.  I will never listen to them.  They're your enemies.  Two people.  Would they get another listen?  So what's your final thought?  My final thoughts are...  Oh, God. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, you hung up on them.  You are a bastard.  My final thoughts are click.  Wow.  Could that be the end?  Yeah, you're coming in at 3 a.m. next time and getting a cab.  Is that it?  He threatened not to pick me up at the airport.  He really did.  It had nothing to do with his wrestling tickets and hanging out with Ben.  He wasn't picking you up, man.  Is that true?  Where's Ben?  That would have sucked. 
[02:01:30]  Now he says, oh, no, you know, it was okay.  I just wanted to get my point across.  With threats?  We don't take kindly to threats.  Hey, John the Cop.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  It's me and my partner, Kevin.  Want to hear the Reverend Al song?  You want to hear the Reverend Al song?  Yeah.  Reverend Al.  All right, we can do that as we go to break.  We haven't played that in a while.  You know what?  I have a dream.  I have a dream today.  I hope this happens to Reverend Al.  He goes over there. 
[02:02:00]  He's got his 50, 100 bucks in his hands.  He's going to buy a woman and a kid.  Whatever.  Remember, the people that are bringing him there, the envoy, start going,  Oh, the other people go,  They put a rope around Reverend Al and make him a slave.  Would that be the irony of all time?  Like the guys he's going with, sell him out. 
[02:02:30]  They sell him into slavery.  Because you know something?  He's not in New York.  He is in a country that is really ripped apart.  And there's no ethics or nowhere he can go if that happens.  They just take him.  And, you know, he turns around, looks at the people that brought him.  They just go,  And he's gone.  Fast forward two years and he looks like Starving Marvin.  Hey, hey, Starving Marvin. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, you look like Reverend Al Sharpton.  You're a little skinny, but she's like a big hubcap.  Bella.  Yes?  Bella.  We're going to talk to you.  I need some opium.  We're going to talk to you after break.  Could you stay there?  Yeah, I guess.  Are you on a car phone?  Well, I'm sitting here on my car phone.  Please hold on, because we will help you with your problems.  Yes, we definitely will.  Please.  I need help.  All right, hold on, hold on.  We'll get into that next.  And I want Mike to hold on. 
[02:03:30]  Mike?  Yes?  We're going to get to you next, all right?  So hold on.  No doubt.  All right.  Let me tell you.  Reverend Al Sharpton, now here's a bargain.  Here's a bargain.  And we throw in a McGuire rookie card.  Look at the size of this bastard.  I know he doesn't look very physically fit to do the work around the house, but for God's sake, you ain't got to feed him for a year.  He'll be in shape to do the lawn, the windows, whatever you want him to do. 
[02:04:00]  He's a big black butt.  Have him chop wood for a week.  I don't care.  Worth the bride.  And only 25 bucks.  25 bucks, you pay twice as much for a little kid or a woman.  Reverend Al Sharpton, sold into slavery.  My God.  And let me tell you, Don, he's got to be about... 
[02:04:30]  Shut the hell up.  I know what he is.  He's huge.  Oh, boy.  Very good.  Well, maybe Reverend Al will be okay.  I'm bringing my slaves back on the Almastad.  My ship, the Almastad.  The Pleasure Clan.  Now I'll set you free, but you've got to roll.  Why is Jim Cook all, all of a sudden, silent over there?  I'm just... 
[02:05:00]  But it's Reverend Al.  Yeah.  It's all done in character.  Right.  Like Mr. Almastad.  I feel like we've got Darma back.  All right.  Keep rolling.  Keep rolling.  I'm the king of the world.  Yeah, I know it's hard with me on the front of this thing, but...  I'm the king of the world.  I'm a survivor.  I'm a survivor.  Jack, hold on, Jack. 
[02:05:30]  I love you forever.  I'm floating here on my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion, and there ain't no room for nobody.  Not even me.  Believe me, I'm sorry.  You're going to freeze your ass off.  Reverend Al and my slaves I just purchased.  We have hit an iceberg in the icy North Atlantic on the Almastad.  And the boat is going down.  I got to save my fat ass.  Why the hell you row into an iceberg? 
[02:06:00]  We're doing two miles an hour.  I said, stop, God damn it.  So now I cast myself off in my big Volkswagen hubcap medallion, and believe me, there ain't barely room for my pinky.  Whoa, I got a fat pinky.  Sorry, Jack, but I must go on.  You slithered below the ocean, but not too far.  I might have to eat you.  Just stay there like some kind of frozen popsicle for a while. 
[02:06:30]  I'm hungry.  I've come to show you.  I'm sorry.  I really had good intentions here.  I did not think we'd hit an iceberg.  Especially right off the coast of Africa.  I have purchased Sleeve Sickles, which I will be selling on my website, reverendow.com.  Hey, I got to make a buck.  I don't care how this ended.  Jim Cook is horrified.  Hey, can I have another beer? 
[02:07:00]  I am a survivor.  Look at this skinny bitch singing this song.  She ain't like a cracker to me.  A camel toe looks like my ass.  Game of me. 
[02:07:30]  Very nice.  Oh, yeah, break.  Yeah, we're so late.  The Reverend Alston as we go to break.  And more with Jim Cook from Sam Adams next, okay?  Also, we got, oh, wow, Artie Bucco from The Sopranos checking in.  He's going to get whacked soon.  He's the restaurant owner, right?  Yeah.  Yes.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan?  Yelling and a-screaming as he's speaking to a mob. 
[02:08:00]  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  The Reverend Alston, Reverend Alston, he's your pal.  The Reverend Alston, well, he's tapping off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  He can hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace. 
[02:08:30]  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an ass that's like a boss.  He's Reverend Alston.  Reverend Alston.  He's your pal.  Reverend Alston.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now, why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bernie gets in the Brawley case?  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face. 
[02:09:00]  He's feeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Alston.  Reverend Alston.  Reverend Alston.  He's your pal.  Reverend Alston.  On a never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Alston.  I'm Reverend Alston.  He's Reverend Alston.  I'm Reverend Alston.  He's coming dry.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Alston. 
[02:09:30]  Reverend Alston.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a seat.  Not as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Alston.  I'm Reverend Alston.  He's Reverend Alston.  I'm your pal.  Well, he's your pal.  That's right.  Reverend Alston.  He's Reverend Alston.  I'm Reverend Alston.  He's a raised-faced white case.  Back up, follow me.  Now, why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Alston.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's Reverend Alston.  I'm Reverend Alston.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal. 
[02:10:00]  That's Reverend Alston.  Reverend Alston.  Hey, this is the Game Triple H from the World Wrestling Federation.  This is no pussy radio.  This is the real deal.  Opie and Anthony.  102.7 WNEW.  Let's see.  Oh, yeah.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Yes.  Mr.  Alabama.  Wow.  I love the Alabama man.  The Farley one's killing me, though. 
[02:10:30]  The new one we got.  What the hell were you thinking?  Jim, have you heard about the Pinnacle Horny Goatweed?  Mr. Sam Adams himself?  No, this sounds like something inspirational.  Yes.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  It's the name of the herb, Horny Goatweed.  You take it, it puts a boost in your sex life.  Think I can make a beer out of this stuff?  Oh!  Imagine Sam Adams Pinnacle Horny Goatweed beer.  Getting together.  Wow.  I don't know.  If you're drinking a lot of beer, though, you don't need the Horny Goatweed. 
[02:11:00]  Anything goes.  Anything goes with the beer.  If you're stressed out, you're under too much pressure, or need to add some spice to the  sex life, because some people, they're together for a while, and then, for some reason, you're  not getting your F on anymore, right?  Didn't that happen?  Jim, do you get your F on?  Yeah, but I'm happily married.  No, that's okay.  It doesn't matter.  That's just it.  Even married, you should get your F on.  There are some people that are married, and they're not getting their F on.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Poor bastards.  That's right.  So, if you want to add some spice to the sex life, get your butt down at GNC.  Get some Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  I wonder why I can't talk after Reverend Al makes an appearance here.  What are you talking about?  What would that have to do with anything?  Call 1-800-899-5323 for Pinnacle Horny Goatweed, or go to a GNC.  People have tried and said it's the single most potent and thoroughly exciting herbal supplement  they've ever tried.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed. 
[02:12:00]  It's been called the ultimate sacred potency supplement.  I'll take it to Africa with me.  Go to GNC to get some of my Horny Goatweed.  Or call them up.  1-800-899-5323.  1-800-899-5323.  Pinnacle Horny Goatweed.  Get some today.  They don't need the Pinnacle Horny Goatweed in Africa.  No.  That seems to be the problem.  Over there.  Stupid. 
[02:12:30]  The award-winning Hopi and Anthony show.  This has got to be a joke, people.  Hey, geeky, geeky.  W-A-W.  Busy show today, Ant.  CO&A show.  Jim Cook from Sam Adams in the studio.  On the phone, Artie from The Sopranos.  Yep.  That's how we know him.  He's an actor, I guess.  His first name's John.  What's the name of John?  John Ventimiglia.  John. 
[02:13:00]  Hey, John.  How do you say your last name?  Ventimiglia.  Ventimiglia.  Yeah.  It means 20 miles.  A nice Irish name.  Yes.  Yeah.  Celtic.  I thought it was a kind of...  Yeah.  Sean.  It's Sean Ventimiglia.  Yeah.  Oh, Sean.  No.  That's very harsh.  Am I yelling?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm sitting in my backyard, and it was really peaceful, and somebody started blaring their  music out the backyard, you know?  Oh.  Well...  So maybe I'll have to move out to the front stoop or something.  Hey, say hi to Jim Cook from Sam Adams. 
[02:13:30]  Yo, Jim.  How's it going, man?  I'm having beer.  How are you doing?  I'm good, man.  I'm having a cigarette, but I should be having a beer, too.  He's hammered.  Hey, Artie.  Do you serve the Sam Adams in your little restaurant there on The Sopranos?  Oh, yeah.  That's one of our specialty brands.  Oh, yeah.  It's a TV show.  Yeah.  Relax.  Oh, it is?  That's right.  So, Artie.  Yeah.  He's going to call him Artie now.  Come on.  I don't know him as John.  I know him as Artie.  Okay.  That's all right. 
[02:14:00]  John, when are you getting whacked?  He's going to tell you.  Oh, come on, guys.  Come on.  All right.  Answer this.  Has the cast of The Sopranos...  That's morbid.  Has the cast of The Sopranos taken you out for dinner yet?  Oh, oh, oh.  I've been out to dinner with those guys.  Oh, come on.  I'm not going to tell you if it was in my honor or not.  Right.  All right.  I've got to tell you, it's looking bad for you.  You got a little crazy there.  You're all hung up.  Yeah.  On Christopher's chick there.  And he's a little hot-tempered. 
[02:14:30]  I was hoping for, like, a fantasy sequence or something.  Yeah, I bet you are.  Yeah.  And did you see that, Paul?  He got the sniffer panties.  He thought no one was looking, too.  He's a sick...  That character, he's a sick...  Yeah, he's a beauty.  He's a beauty.  So you are...  You're treading in an area that's a little dangerous.  Oh, granted.  Yeah, a little dangerous.  And you're going through your midlife crisis.  That's right.  You got your earring there that was real dainty.  It's a diamond. 
[02:15:00]  Yes.  You know, like quarter-carat or something.  And you're getting the divorce?  Yeah, it's looking that way.  Man, everyone hates your wife on the shelf.  Oh, God.  I don't know why.  Oh, she's so annoying.  Annoying.  Yeah, she's a little pushy, a little controlling, but she's really a sweet lady.  I'm hearing a rumor that you take her out.  Oh, really, Opie?  Hearing some rumors.  I think Opie's just throwing his own rumors around, waiting to see what you say about it.  I want to see what sticks.  Yeah, something you can read about in the post or something. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  God, I can't read that paper anymore.  Now, how can your character, let's say, stomach just even associating with Tony after what he did to your restaurant?  Well, me and Tony, you know, my character and Tony, you know, they go back a long way.  Yeah.  And, you know, they've been through a lot before.  Tony's helped them out.  And I think that, you know, when he asked Tony if he did it, Tony did look him in the eyes and say, I did not burn down your restaurant.  So...  Why?  Yeah, so, you know, I think he doesn't want to know the truth in a way. 
[02:16:00]  He's got an idea he's not 100% sure.  It seems like you don't want to commit.  I think the writing's on the wall, but, you know...  You don't want to commit, really.  It seems like you kind of do these things, but you don't have the balls, really, to go headlong into it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really makes for a great character.  Yeah, it's a good conflict.  He's a conflicted guy.  He's emotional, you know.  Well, now you're going to be out there with the young chippies.  Why don't you go to one of Tony's BJ parties?  Wait, you'd be a natural. 
[02:16:30]  You're just getting a divorce.  Go to the BJ party.  He's got a lot of energy to burn, this guy.  The BJ party's rocking.  And how they film it?  The one when Tony's getting the BJ.  And that girl's working.  I'm like, holy...  And he's just pissed off because something else is going on and takes his attention away from it.  Yeah, he has all the fun.  Oh, I hope Artie ends up in a BJ party.  That'd be great.  Put some hair on his head.  I heard there's another rumor that you're going to be the next guy to nail Meadow Soprano.  Wait, where are all these rumors coming from?  From right here in this studio.  Yeah.  We have a way of getting info from people that don't want to talk. 
[02:17:00]  There's been a lot of talk.  Artie doing Tony's daughter.  All right, Artie, how about this?  Or John.  John.  Yo.  We feel like we know you now.  Oh, good.  Give us a little something about the Sopranos.  A little tease.  A little something.  We have so many of you guys on and no one gives us anything.  We can't.  What can we give you?  You don't really want to know.  He's right.  It's juicy just the way it is.  How about this?  Say someone important's going to die soon. 
[02:17:30]  I can't even say that.  You can't say it.  I can't say that.  Isn't it cool?  They like tear a page out of the script and they roll it up into a little ball and you  got to put it in your palm and they light it on fire and they say, promise you will  never say anything about the show.  Are all the shows for this season done?  Yeah.  Oh, they are done.  Okay.  And do you actually know what happens?  I do.  You keep it in the dark.  Yeah.  Okay.  And what is that?  I hear sometimes...  I'm going for the direct approach.  We're not trying to strip them up. 
[02:18:00]  I hear sometimes as you guys are filming, you have no idea what's going to happen.  And it's a big surprise to you guys sometimes.  Well, sometimes you might just get like a part of the script.  Right.  But the regulars get the full script every episode.  I've also heard, I think it was in the Rolling Stone article that when they hand out the script...  Everybody runs right into a corner with it and flips through it real quick.  Yeah, to see if they're going to die.  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of ironic, isn't it?  It's kind of funny that way.  It's kind of like real life. 
[02:18:30]  That would really...  Because it is kind of like real life.  You want to be on this show.  This is like the hottest show.  Absolutely.  And if you get written off, you're just done.  You're done.  You're whacked.  Goddamn.  Like, what's his face there from Rocky?  Paulie from Rocky.  We were hoping to get another...  Burt Young.  Burt Young.  Yeah, Burt Young.  We were hoping to get another episode out of him.  That was a great...  Talking about coming on and going out with a great friggin' episode.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Firework. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Artie, how are you going to cook with one freaking eye?  That was a great scene.  I could cook with one eye, but I can only use one pan at a time.  Yeah.  Now, that shows you the kind of fire Christopher has.  He holds a fork to your eyeball.  You're going to cook with one F and I.  See, Artie's known Christopher, too, since he was a young kid.  Maybe he's still thinking this is a young guy, and he just realized, wait a minute, he's grown up now.  Yeah.  But, you know, he's...  You know, I think...  I'm hoping that Christopher would have to go to Tony and say, hey, you know, I've got to do something about Artie. 
[02:19:30]  You know, I'd have to get, like, two, three strikes.  Right, and Tony's not going to right away just say, all right, do what you've got to do.  I don't know.  You know, because he's kind of your pal.  He's my pal, yeah.  Other people thinking that you're going to turn around and try to do something to Christopher.  People are crazy.  He's not going to give it to anything.  That would be a good one, too, because you'd known to have been a little crazy.  You did hold a gun on to Tony.  Yeah, I did hold a gun on to Tony.  That's true.  Yeah, so you...  But, again, I don't think you had the balls to go through with it. 
[02:20:00]  No.  Artie...  Come on, he doesn't want to lose his career there.  They'd have to shut down the restaurant.  Artie, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  Who wins Survivor 2?  The tall guy.  I don't even watch that show.  The tall guy?  He got voted off, like, week three.  Yeah, I know.  Was I close?  No.  Was I close?  You're funny, man.  You know, this is a driving show.  I wanted to get in my car and, like, hit the highway or something, but, you know, my cell  phone is constantly going out of service. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  You know?  How do people talk to you and not get cut off?  It happens a lot on the cell phones, believe me.  It does.  It's a pain in the ass.  We have to be quick on our feet.  Yeah.  We have to move on to something else.  Even with these phones, every now and then you get, like, the neighbor cutting in, you  know?  Yeah.  You're just getting recognized all over the place, I bet, huh?  Yeah, more and more, definitely.  Like, you know.  What are people like?  Hey, you got some pie?  Hey, can you really cook?  You know, that's a big one.  Can you really cook?  Can you really cook?  You look like you know what you're doing.  Hey, uh, Aaron. 
[02:21:00]  Aaron.  Where's Aaron on the phone?  Aaron.  Aaron.  Who's Aaron?  Aaron.  He's supposed to be on the phone, but you know something?  I think he's on a car phone.  He's on his cell phone.  And it effed up.  He stayed at home, Aaron.  I'm really curious, because he says that Artie just gave something away.  Oh.  Are you scared about that?  That maybe, uh, talking to us or someone else?  I gave something away?  That you might give something away?  Hold on.  Aaron, you there?  Nah, he's not.  I didn't give nothing.  Aaron doesn't know what he's talking about.  All right.  Hold on.  He's a seasoned veteran with this.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Okay. 
[02:21:30]  You know what you're doing when you talk to people?  Oh, yeah.  You tell your family or anything?  No.  No?  No.  How do you do that?  Are you a married guy?  Yeah.  You don't tell your wife?  No.  Get out of here.  I don't want to ruin it for her.  How can you?  All they got to do is turn around.  She doesn't want to.  She doesn't want to.  She lets me do my business.  You son of a bitch.  Why can't you do that?  All right, baby.  I'll tell you before you know whatever you know.  It's a lot more fun to watch it when you don't know what's going to happen.  It really is.  You're right.  But the curiosity kills you.  People always come up to me.  They say, what can you tell me? 
[02:22:00]  Nothing.  I can tell you nothing.  You don't want to know anything.  Now, does your wife give you problems when you're doing those acting scenes with the  air?  No.  Yeah, but she's probably looking real close going, look, look, pal.  That's the last thing.  I know you.  Imagine.  That would suck.  Wife gets on your case.  No, no.  Because you can see that you're enjoying it a little too much.  Everything's cool there.  Artie gets shot down.  You know, he goes after the chick.  Artie gets shot.  Oh, my God.  He just said, Artie. 
[02:22:30]  She goes to the bathroom.  Do you?  Yeah, I know.  That was kind of pathetic.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Watching that, you're like, oof, ouch.  A lot of people are saying that you banged Adriana, but you already gave that away that  you don't, I think.  No, I didn't.  I just said I didn't say anything.  Also, I mean, I can't see that happening, because she just kind of doesn't, she's not  interested.  She doesn't seem to be.  No.  Maybe she'll do it to get back at Christopher, because now Christopher's banging the  hose in the cheap motel.  Your guess is as good as mine.  There are these little side things. 
[02:23:00]  You go in?  That's what I like about the Sopranos.  You go either way.  It's just so many possibilities.  Unpredictable show.  That's why it's so great.  Where are you living?  Brooklyn.  You do live in Brooklyn.  Yes.  So am I.  No kidding.  I'm over there, right?  Yeah, me too.  I'm in Bay Ridge.  I'm close by.  Oh, maybe let's see you on the street by the water or something.  I occasionally hit a restaurant over there.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  Would you like to go out for a beer, or is this just kind of a radio thing where, like,  you know.  Hey, man, if you ever see me around, let's go get a beer. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, that's the blow-off.  All right.  You know?  So we'll probably bump into each other.  I don't know what you look like, but you know what I look like.  We get this strange feeling sometimes with the people that call our shows that we're  actually their friends.  You know what?  I'll have a little signal to let you know it's me.  All right.  Do that.  I'll hold a fork.  I'm going to go, you want to try to take a one-effing eye?  And we go, call the police.  Hey, John, what about the big pussy?  Does he come back or what?  He's dead.  Well, you saw his reflection. 
[02:24:00]  Saw his reflection in, what was that, week two?  Yeah.  We saw the talking fish again.  Yeah, we saw the talking fish, which makes me think it was all in Tony's mind.  A lot of people had that theory.  And who else thought the poodle was going to get it this week?  I was, you know something?  It's not in Tony's nature.  No.  He gave in a poodle thing.  I don't know about that.  He gave that poodle look.  I'm like, oh, God.  He'd get you nervous there for a minute, though.  You know, it did for a little while.  He was ready to cave in the big pussy.  I got nervous.  A poodle skull.  Let me tell you something.  Anything's possible after the dancer got the ass beat out of her. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, that's not Tony.  No, I've got to be honest.  No, I know, but at that point, I'm thinking they'll do anything.  I was surprised Tony beat the crap out of the bouncer guy with the talking fish thing on the wall.  I mean, that was a little weird.  That poor bouncer.  What the hell is up with that?  He's getting beaten up every episode now.  Well, he's got the best of both worlds, that guy.  Aaron is back on the line.  Aaron?  Hey, guys.  What's going on today?  How are you doing?  What do you think Artie gave away?  The same thing on it. 
[02:25:00]  This is what I think.  When you guys had that rapist on a couple of weeks ago, he said that he hasn't filmed any  more episodes this season.  Oh, the rapist.  Right.  Yeah, the rapist.  And I don't know if it was really, but Artie just said that...  John.  John has said that all the episodes of the season have been filmed already, so that leads  me to believe that the rapist lives.  Well, we know that.  We figured that out on our own.  Oh, okay.  Wait, what does this have to do with the rapist?  I know.  That's what I don't get.  You mean Jesus Rossi?  Yes.  Jesus Rossi.  Yeah, people really want that guy to get it, man. 
[02:25:30]  When you just dined for him, for her to tell Tony?  I know.  That end of that episode.  That's a beauty.  Where he goes, do you want to tell me something?  A little delay, and she goes, no.  That's why that show is so good.  You're just like, God damn, say yes and have him do some justice.  John, we had the rapist guy on our show in studio, and it was just really weird to look  at him.  To see him, yeah, because he's a fireman here in New York.  He's keeping you out a little bit.  Yeah, because it was just too real.  You're the rapist.  You're the rapist.  We had him take a picture with our really cute young intern.  We thought he was going to throw it down the stairwell. 
[02:26:00]  People really attack that guy on the street.  Yeah, you would think.  You know, he's kind of a disliked character.  How could you do that to that lovely psychiatrist?  Right.  John, do you get frustrated when people come up to you and say, hey, Artie?  No, not at all.  It's cool, right?  It's great, man, you know.  What have you done before this?  I've done a lot of independent films, like The Funeral.  Okay, nothing.  I thought I'd do all girls' town.  All right.  Yeah, nothing.  Nothing.  This was a huge break, huh? 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  I've got to be nice.  Yeah, it's great.  Wow.  I got your bio right here.  You got it.  Anthony, he was in Plan B.  Plan B?  He was also in Woman Found Dead in the Elevator.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Wait a minute.  What is that?  Was I in that?  What is that?  I must have been doing somebody a favor.  Don't worry.  Nobody saw it.  You know what happens, though, John?  All these movies make a comeback, and they put your picture on the video box, the plot  bus, and it's just starring from The Sopranos. 
[02:27:00]  There's big people in those things already.  Yeah.  I got to work with George Plimpton on that other one you said.  What, the Elevator one?  Yeah.  George Plimpton?  No.  Come on.  The guy's fantastic.  Was that in movie theaters there, John?  No.  It was something else.  It was 8mm.  Yeah.  You getting offers now, though, for some films and stuff?  No, really.  No?  Not tons.  Because you got the whole thing going there.  I mean, the kind of thing is really... 
[02:27:30]  Would you like to come in and have some free Sam Adams?  That's tempting.  I got your number.  If you're in Brooklyn, if you live in Brooklyn, you got to come on the show.  We have a lot of fun in here.  Ask Jim.  They do.  Do you like the...  It sounds like a lot of fun.  Yeah, and you won't even have to...  You guys got good hours, too.  Oh, please.  What, 3 to 7?  Yeah, we're...  Like, what are you into?  What do you do?  What kind of music do you like?  I like a lot of stuff.  I got kind of an eclectic taste in music.  Yeah?  I like kind of really Depression-era kind of feel-good music. 
[02:28:00]  You know, like Pennies from Heaven kind of stuff.  Are you kidding me?  No.  April Showers, that kind of stuff.  April Showers, what?  Yeah.  I like Nick Cave a lot.  They should whack you for your music taste.  Jesus.  No, but it varies.  It varies.  But I'm not very contemporary, I've got to tell you, man.  That's all right.  No, Rick.  You said he's married.  My wife's got better taste in music than I do.  Rick was asking if, you know, Fagel. 
[02:28:30]  No.  No, Rick.  Because I'm bald?  No, because you're pennies from Heaven.  My God.  Come on.  That's good stuff.  That's a little rough to swallow there.  Hey, John.  Yeah.  You don't have any Streisand albums, do you?  What can I say?  Who?  Streisand.  You don't have any Streisand albums.  No, that's not the six.  That's totally different.  Okay.  No.  You don't like Liza?  No, no.  All right.  I'm just making sure.  Depression.  These guys are tough, man.  Go pay, John.  Liberace.  Just making sure. 
[02:29:00]  All right, John.  What are we promoting today?  Oh, we are promoting.  This is cool, right?  This is, yeah.  This is for prostate screening awareness.  Madison Sports Inc. is hosting an event at the Vanderbilt Wednesday night.  Tomorrow night.  Good cause.  It's a cigar dinner night.  That's what they tell me.  Hosting Cigar Network 5.  Oh, here we go.  Yeah.  A Soprano's Cigar Dinner Night to Benefit the Prostate Screening Awareness Foundation.  That's right.  Tomorrow night at the Vanderbilt on Long Island in Plainview there, right? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Tickets available now through Ticketmaster or at the Vanderbilt box office.  Cool.  So I didn't crack?  Nope.  Not at all.  You tried.  You did a good job.  You did very well.  Give me credit.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, John.  All right.  I'll see you around.  Later.  Around the neighborhood.  All right.  Sounds good.  And I'll see you around the neighborhood.  Ah, yes.  There we go.  One of my celebrity neighbors, Opie, in Bay Ridge.  Artie from The Sopranos.  Artie from The Sopranos.  He's getting whacked.  I'm telling you.  I live in Bay Ridge, so I was looking for a place. 
[02:30:00]  I see the restaurants that she says she goes to around Bay Ridge.  She commutes from her hopl.  I laugh waiting for this.  All right.  We'll get back to Jim Cook and Sam Adams next.  Yes.  Tim, you've been awfully quiet over there.  I'm just drinking.  You're like the third member of the show today.  You've got to jump in when you can.  Well, you guys are good.  I'm just a designated drinker.  What happened to that lady that needed sex advice?  She's been married for 10 years.  God damn it.  If she's still listening, give us a call back. 
[02:30:30]  We want to talk to you next.  And we've got to ask Jim about the Uck truck.  Yes, we'll do that, Mike.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  If you just tell us, there was bloody child underpants in one of their apartments.  Hope you were worse than cereal.  Yeah, well.  I don't understand what's so bad about team.  Guess what?  They're my pants.  One-oh-two-seven-WNW.  Chrissy.  Hiya.  Real fast because we're in the middle of commercials.  What's up?  I want to know why he's promoting prostate cancer dinner with cigars.  Because you don't want prostate cancer, but you'll get a mouth cancer? 
[02:31:00]  You don't put them there.  I know you don't put them there, but it's still a cancer.  Oh, that mouth cancer is overrated.  It was the promise of a cigar dinner to benefit prostate screening awareness.  You know, that's just a little weird.  A little strange.  Isn't it?  All right.  What did I do?  I didn't even think about that.  It all depends where you put the cigar.  Right.  Well, hey.  You know, Clint.  Let me tell you about the vaginal cancer. 
[02:31:30]  I can't do a cigar now.  All right, Chrissy.  Thank you.  All right.  Later.  Let's all light up.  At least my prostate's okay.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yes, Opie.  Iced coffee just got cool.  It's Planet Java, the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Planet Java.  It ain't no social drink.  It's iced coffee that lets you be yourself.  And, of course, this is only if you want to drink something that isn't Sam Adams beer. 
[02:32:00]  I got some lesser beverage.  I got the tie-in, eh?  Tie-in, you're drinking some Sam Adams.  Next day, you're thinking, you know, I may need a little boost to get me started today.  Uh-huh.  Tremble.  Tremble.  Reach for the Planet Java.  Ixnay on the S-E-R-L-A-E-B-R-I-V-J-P-A-Y.  Is this a sobriety test?  How about Javadelic with a little lager poured on top of it? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, nice.  Now you're talking, right?  That's good.  I like it.  Nice beer buzz and wired.  Tremble.  Or how about Caramoca?  Let's say Caramoca.  Sounds creamy. 
[02:33:00]  Sounds mocha-y.  Chocolate-y.  Chocolate-y.  What would you recommend the mocha pouring on top of that?  Sam Adams Cream Stout.  Cream Stout.  Alabama-mow.  You'll be a real Alabama-mow.  And like Opie said, a little Tremble helps you out if you've maybe had a few too many.  Tremble is the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  And you'd have to maybe bring it down.  How about some of that high-octane... 
[02:33:30]  Triple Bach.  Triple Bach.  It's like a poor man's speedball.  Yeah.  Right?  What do you think, Jim?  Yes?  Yeah, you need some Tremble after that.  Alabama-mow!  Wow!  Jim, comment?  My new favorite damn sound clip.  I love it.  I love it.  And you'll love Planet Java.  Yeah, Planet Java definitely is cool. 
[02:34:00]  Ice coffee just got cool.  That's what they say, Anthony.  Yes.  And they've got sampling trucks all over the tri-state area so you can try out the drinks for yourself.  The Javadelic, the Karamoca, and, of course, the Tremble with the fine Planet Java packaging.  I think he's cocking.  Be yourself with Planet Java.  Ice coffee with an attitude and available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, tell them to get it. 
[02:34:30]  Ice coffee just got cool and it's called Planet Java.  I'm a Mable-mow!  Opie, I'm the dick.  Anthony.  Yeah, well, I'm an ass.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I would have rather watched my grandparents give oral pleasure to each other.  Oh!  1027.  Somebody ready to go here.  I'm hanging with Jim Cook from Sam Adams. 
[02:35:00]  With his beer rocket pack, Anthony.  Yes.  We're hoping that lady calls back.  She's been married for 10 years and needs some sex advice.  I can give her beer.  She's on her own for the sex advice.  I'm going to have to listen to you guys.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to speak to Jim Cook a minute and just confirm... 
[02:35:30]  I think we fired him.  Jim, he's fired.  Yeah, but I'm standing in for him.  Nice, nice.  I just wanted to confirm something I heard on the show a while back.  Is it not true that you drove the Uck truck up at Wellesley?  I never drove the Uck truck.  I'm driving the Uck truck.  No.  Do not believe what you hear.  This is not a place for breaking news.  I don't even think Jim knows what the Uck truck is.  Maybe you should explain it. 
[02:36:00]  And you're from Boston, Jim.  I remember the Uck truck.  You have heard of the Uck truck?  Yeah, it goes from Wellesley to Harvard Square.  Oh, my God.  Sam Adams sponsors it.  No.  No, it is not powered by Sam Adams.  Oh, good God.  Those Wellesley chicks are on there, and we will not associate ourselves with Hillary.  So the Wellesley chicks are wild, right?  They're goers?  Well, Hillary Clinton, make your own assessment, man.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right, freaks. 
[02:36:30]  Bye.  Peace.  Not the Uck truck.  Ron has a question.  Ron?  Yeah, what's up, man?  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  I've been hearing you playing the Alabama Man song.  Alabama Man!  Is that a riot?  You got the whole song?  We should get the whole song.  It is a picture.  It's like the lines are like,  the Trimsy-Bosey-Bosey-Trimsy's Alabama Man!  It is a riot.  What about the disclaimer at the end?  I got off Napster.  People from Alabama beat their wives. 
[02:37:00]  What was it, Rick?  Oh, not all people from Alabama beat their wives.  Oh, sorry, man.  You got to...  Yeah, the women don't.  Ron, you're breaking up bad.  Alabama Man!  It is so friggin' funny, man.  All right.  All right, guys.  Enjoy the show.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Yeah, we'll have to get the whole one, the whole ad.  It's from South Park.  Joe.  Hi.  Hey.  I was wondering, I have a question for Jim Cook.  I'm a big fan of the Golden Pilsner. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, good.  I was wondering when that's available and when I can get some more of it.  Well, you can get it.  Go to, like, Gristini's.  A&P.  You ought to be able to get it.  Where do you live, man?  Little Island.  Where?  Long Island?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can get it out on the island.  Go to a supermarket.  Jim, I like the Golden Shower.  Where can I pick that up?  That's for the cheap beer.  Golden Pilsner.  Yeah, that's a waste of Sam Adams.  That's alcohol abuse.  We don't know how to see it.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Just curious.  Gristini's? 
[02:38:00]  So I go for the Golden Shower?  A&P?  A&P.  Get it?  Thank you.  Enjoy your beer twice?  Yes.  Anthony, I got something really good here.  Yeah.  Where is this from?  Time Out?  Yeah.  This is a sex advice column in the back.  And they get a little funky.  Right.  With the questions and answers.  Yeah, it's the latest issue of Time Out, the one with P.B. Herman on the cover.  Yeah, what's the guy's name?  Because he is really...  His column's really good.  Oh, you don't have the time out there? 
[02:38:30]  I don't have it with me.  No big deal.  I got a career back.  Ha-ha.  Ha-ha.  That'd blow.  Ha-ha.  Blow.  Ha-ha.  That's what I did with my load.  It's a load, I can say, man.  Right?  Sure, why not?  You want me to read this?  Yeah.  Jim, if you have a comment on this, you can jump right in, okay?  All right.  All right.  Question.  This is a girl, I'm assuming?  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  My boyfriend was recently house-cleaning, naked. 
[02:39:00]  Wait.  All right.  Right away.  Stop.  What is that?  How about we hit, uh, hit the bell every time there's something that is just completely  false in this little red flag?  Yeah.  In this little scenario.  Okay, it?  All right.  My boyfriend was recently house-cleaning naked.  On two, on two counts there.  House-cleaning?  No.  And naked?  No.  Yeah.  Now, when you do clean, are you ever naked?  No.  No. 
[02:39:30]  Jim?  No, I wear a little apron.  A little apron.  That's a problem there.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, let's see.  Okay.  Uh, my boyfriend was recently house-cleaning naked when he fell backward onto a flashlight.  Light.  What do you...  How do you fall backward on your flashlight?  I don't get that.  There's another flag.  Okay.  So far, there's a lot of problems with this scenario. 
[02:40:00]  It gets better.  Ow!  My boyfriend was recently house-cleaning naked when he fell backward onto a flashlight.  Yeah.  I came home, there's the lady talking, to find him in the bathroom, sobbing uncontrollably  because it wouldn't come out.  Jim, comment?  I mean, at least it wasn't a Sam Adams bottle.  Happened once with a Sam bottle.  I remember I was cleaning the brewery and I fell on a keg. 
[02:40:30]  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding, Jim.  I got the nickel deposit.  That would be a lot more expensive deposit than that.  All right.  So now he's in the bathroom sobbing.  Sobbing uncontrollably because it wouldn't come out.  When I asked him if it maybe wasn't an accident...  And if he wanted me to dabble in wearing a...  Can we say that, I guess? 
[02:41:00]  Strap-on.  All right.  Dabble in wearing a strap-on.  He told me to check that idea at the door.  That is behind...  That his behind was exit only and he was the one wearing the pants in this relationship.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, ah.  Anyway.  Except when he's house cleaning.  Yeah.  In the news.  Anyway.  This brings me to my question.  How in the world would something get stuck in his...  Right. 
[02:41:30]  Not only...  I mean, look at the whole beginning of this.  She comes home.  If you did...  Let's say the stars are aligned, Opie.  Something is wacky going on.  You're house cleaning naked.  Right.  You fall backwards.  Right.  What luck on a flashlight.  Right.  Are you going to be sobbing in the bathroom with the door open so Sandy can walk in and  go, what happened?  It looks like a morag.  It's in the hole! 
[02:42:00]  Why is that brilliant light coming out your butt?  Like, wouldn't you...  I see your x-ray of your belly.  Wouldn't you just...  If, like I said, miraculous, the stars are aligned in a certain way, that this did happen...  You would yank for all it's worth.  And wouldn't you just be in the bathroom going, hey, it's...  Oh, I have an upset stomach.  I'm going to be in here.  Woo, don't come in here.  Woo, light a match.  Like, there's...  You wouldn't do that.  Virgin.  Well?  You wouldn't wait until your chick comes in and be sitting there sobbing, well, what 
[02:42:30]  do you think I'm crying about?  I got a flashlight there.  Uh, Anthony, we have audio of the guy after he fell on the flashlight.  Yeah.  Ouch.  Yeah, I would say that, too.  We got it right when he fell on, this, uh...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Wouldn't it be marvelous if I turned out to be a homosexual?  That's a winner.  Oh, my God. 
[02:43:00]  Anthony, you know, you could be naked, fall backwards a hundred times, and you wouldn't  be able to get the flashlight to end up there.  Sweet, merciful crap!  What the hell were you thinking?  That's my new baby.  Yeah, you could, uh, practice that move a thousand times.  Go at yourself!  Well, it looks like some of that was going on, Mark.  Yes.  How do you fall and have that happen?  Oh, gay? 
[02:43:30]  Exactly.  Gay, totally gay.  Liberacee gay.  Jim, comment?  No.  Hey, I'm not going there.  All right, so where are we?  Okay, so, uh, blah, blah.  How in the world, uh, would something get stuck in his...  I mean, things come out of there all the time.  Why not the flashlight?  Hmm.  And how can I get my boyfriend over the fear that a straight guy can't enjoy, uh...  Backdoor action.  Thank you.  And that it doesn't make him any less of a man. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, yeah, it does.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  I like that, DJ!  And this is the line that kills me from the whole scenario.  Yeah.  Are there any introduction to...  Can we say that?  No.  Any introduction to...  A.  A-sex books that aren't gay-oriented.  Alabama-man! 
[02:44:30]  He wouldn't know.  He's Alabama-man.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Hey, everybody!  We're all gonna get laid!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  All right.  It's coming right forward!  Yeah, look where it's headed.  Ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wow.  Well, that's a tough question.  Uh, Bob wants in on this. 
[02:45:00]  bob what's up hey guys how's it going hey hey like sam like sam kenniston used to say this  is something you have to make an appointment for it's not something that just happened yeah you  just happen to fall on a flashlight while you're cleaning naked in your house you don't just fall  on flashlights you plan it out that's right couldn't do it by itself no  all right do we need the answer i don't think so right
