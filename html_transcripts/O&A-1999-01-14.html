<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts casually discussing the snowfall outside, their initial unawareness of its intensity quickly giving way to excitement.  They then enthusiastically announce a live broadcast from Manny's Cocktail Lounge in Menachie, New Jersey, the following day â€“ a Jets pep rally culminating in the sledgehammer destruction of a Bronco.  The marketing department receives praise for securing this event.  A caller, Barbara, attempts a Jets chant, failing hilariously and yet winning a Jets prize package.  William Shatner, present in the studio as a Priceline.com spokesperson, delivers a bizarre commercial incorporating time travel and "ignats" as currency.  Opie jokingly cancels all flights for the next two days.

The conversation then turns to a lengthy, humorous dissection of *Mommie Dearest*, focusing on Faye Dunaway's performance and memorable lines.  The show's boss departs early, leading to speculation about his exit and recent changes at the station.  More callers attempt the Jets chant for a chance to win a Denver game trip.  An NYPD caller shares darkly humorous anecdotes from his work experience, sparking a related exchange.  Further promotion of the live broadcast follows, detailing the Bronco demolition and charity fundraising aspects.  A poorly-received Jets-themed song is discussed, and Stephen Lynch is mentioned as a favorite past guest.  The segment ends with Opie's entertaining interaction with a telemarketer.

Following this, the show inexplicably transitions to a nonsensical discussion about forcibly entering a building, involving phrases like "cave the door in... window first."  This swiftly shifts to a discussion of low-budget prison movies, specifically their stereotypical portrayal of female inmates, with the hosts sharing their enjoyment of the genre and referencing vaguely described, suggestive scenes.  This then leads back to clips from *Mommie Dearest*, again focusing on Joan Crawford's furious outbursts at Christina, including audio clips of the infamous wire hanger scene and another described as a "boardroom" scene.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNAW, the Rock of New York, brand new band on the music scene, that's Train with the song Free, some Skinner before that.  That Skinner goes out to a guy that requested it yesterday. I pray he's still listening.  From yesterday? Yeah.  Alright, you never know. That's how lazy we are.  I really hope the guy's listening because he called about ten times yesterday and I said, yeah man, I'll get it on for you.  No really, I'll get it on.  Well you did, finally.  Good afternoon everybody, hope you're making it through with this snow, ice, slate, freezing rain. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, it's snowing out?  Well, I don't think it's doing anything right now, is it?  No.  Oh wow, I didn't know that. I was watching TV and listening to radio all day today.  Yeah, they never broke in with any weather.  Yeah, no one really mentioned it. Wow.  Really? Oh, look at that.  It seems to be a little flake or two.  Oh, it's going to be a tough ride home today, I guess.  I wish someone would have told me. I would have prepared. 
[00:01:00]  I would have ran to the store and got my canned goods just in case the lights go out today.  Batteries.  Put some sand in your trunk, Opie.  Check the elderly.  And be careful.  Make sure you don't leave your pets outdoors.  Yeah, bring your pets in, because they get cold too, even though they have fur.  Hmm.  Alright.  Little tips that we've heard all day long.  Oh, great.  I got to hand it to our marketing department here at NAW. 
[00:01:30]  Yes.  This could be the first nice thing we've said about Roger and the rest of the gang in marketing.  Yes.  We went on the air yesterday and said that we want to have a Jets pep rally.  A little party for the boys.  We also said we need a Bronco.  Yes.  So we can beat the crap out of it with sledgehammers.  We're going to, like, tag it with spray paint.  Mm-hmm.  And then beat the crap out of it.  Anthony, I'm proud to say that we are going to be broadcasting live tomorrow from 3 to 7. 
[00:02:00]  Isn't this great? We're finally getting out.  They're finally letting us out of the studio.  Finally.  I guess we did something right.  Well, I wouldn't push it.  So where are we going to be?  Manny's Cocktail Lounge.  In Menachie.  Menachie, New Jersey.  Yes.  We're going to have a Bronco.  They had to buy a Bronco for us.  Can you believe this?  That's amazing.  I didn't realize we had a budget, but they bought a Bronco.  We're going to spray paint it.  We're going to hand out sledgehammers, and we are going to have a good old time tomorrow.  Pound this thing.  We're going to get ready for the big game on Sunday. 
[00:02:30]  It's going to look uglier than Elway's teeth.  Yes.  When we're done with it.  So we're encouraging.  That's good.  We're encouraging everyone to join us tomorrow if you're a Jets fan, if you're a Giants fan,  if you just want to hang out and party, because the beer will be a flowing.  Right.  All right.  If you need to figure out how to get there, we have the directions right on the website,  the WNEW website.  All right.  Cool.  So I applaud the marketing department.  Bravo.  Earl, were you part of that?  Sort of, yes. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  Well, thanks, black girl.  Job well done.  All right.  We've got lots to do.  We've got the Jets chant ready to go.  When you hear that, that's your cue to try to win the trip to Denver for the game.  Yeah.  We've been doing this for the last few days, and I must say, I was listening to EW today,  and people are finally getting psyched and finally getting into it.  You hear some of these people?  Yeah.  Sound like stark raving lunatic.  That's what we want to hear, though.  Exactly.  We want you to...  You know, we want to feel what you're feeling.  Blood come out.  That's right. 
[00:03:30]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Billy Squire.  Lonely is the night.  Days of the new before that touch peel and stand.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  And we played that, the Jets chant there, Anthony, so we've got to get another qualifier  for the trip to Denver to see the game.  All right.  And we've got Barbara here on line two.  Let's see if Barbara could give us a good shout.  Barbara?  Yep.  How are you?  All right.  You heard the Jets chant?  Yep.  And you're ready to do a chant back? 
[00:04:00]  We're ready to do a chant.  Okay.  Now, if you don't do it well enough, we're going to hang up on you.  We get very upset.  All right.  That's the chance I have to take.  We get very upset.  And not only us, the real hardcore Jets fans go, oh, come on.  I could have done that better.  Yes.  So we need something, like an A effort out of you.  Now, where are you now?  I'm at home.  Okay.  So you have no excuses, no bosses around, nothing.  Right, right.  All right.  Here's Barbara, everyone.  Okay.  J-E-P-S. 
[00:04:30]  Jets, Jets, Jets.  Okay.  That must have been the wind-up.  That dead silence before she started.  Now, Barbara.  Yes.  People are driving off the road right now.  That has nothing to do with the ice.  Well, you know, I can't be responsible for everything.  They're ticked off.  They need you to do it louder.  Louder, huh?  Yeah, like when your voice starts crackling.  Are you married?  Do you have kids?  Married, and I got one on the way. 
[00:05:00]  Oh.  Oh, okay.  All right.  My first new Jets fan is on the way.  All right.  We don't want you to go into premature labor here, so.  All right.  You think you can do it a little louder, though?  Okay.  We'll try.  Okay.  Come on, Barbara.  Push, push.  Push, push.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Almost broke her water with that one.  That's the only reason we're going to let you slide.  All right.  Because you got the kid on the way.  But congratulations.  You got a Jets prize package, which is a Jets sweatshirt and a bunch of other things. 
[00:05:30]  And we're going to be picking the winner of the trip tomorrow during Steve's show.  Okay.  Yeah.  The new morning guy.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Rick's going to get some info from you.  Okay.  Thanks.  There she goes, Barbara.  We're going to do that a few more times today.  So keep listening.  All right.  One of those lucky people whisked off to Denver.  Yes.  Yes.  And don't forget tomorrow is the big pep rally at Manny's in Menachie, New Jersey.  I like to just call it a big, big-ass party.  You don't like the word pep rally? 
[00:06:00]  It reminds me of Skull.  Hate it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, we want to, like, build a bonfire and stuff, but...  Just a party.  It's a Jets party.  Okay.  We're all just going to go out there and have a great time, beat the living crap out of  a Bronco.  Mm-hmm.  That's always fun for getting your frustrations out on a Friday.  How many times are you driving home and you'd like to stop off somewhere and just take a  sledgehammer to a vehicle?  Yeah.  We're giving you that chance tomorrow.  Yeah.  And we're broadcasting live.  We got the Bronco.  We're going to spray paint it. 
[00:06:30]  And Manny's is a sports bar.  Mm-hmm.  So you know what that means, gang.  Yeah.  It's going to be one big party.  Don't let the weather get you down because we'll be partying inside and outside.  It's just going to be a blast.  All right?  Now, a lot of people are calling for the directions to Manny's.  Mm-hmm.  Are they on our website?  Now I'm hearing rumors it might not be on our website, the directions.  Oh.  Well, I'm going to have to pop the website up now and see.  Okay.  My God.  On the way, we got some Lenny Kravitz and David Bowie. 
[00:07:00]  Good.  Hey, it's Faye Dunaway's birthday today.  Oh, we'll get into that next.  Star of my favorite movie.  All right, Anthony.  Of all times, man.  We'll get into that next.  Yeah, yeah.  Cool.  All right.  It's Priceline.com.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And is William Shatner in the studio once again today?  I am the spokesman for Priceline.  I love Priceline.  It's fabulous.  It's how I bought the Enterprise.  Really? 
[00:07:30]  Yes, I called Priceline and said, I need a Starship, and I only want to pay this much for it.  And they got it for me.  Wait a minute.  At the price, I wanted to pay.  Yeah, but Priceline's not into StarCrafts yet.  No, this is in the future.  Oh, I see.  See, I used my time warp to come back.  In the future, Priceline will actually have Starships, too.  It's going to be fabulous.  Well, right now, they're into airline tickets and hotel rooms.  They're pushing the hotel rooms right now, Mr. Shatner. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  I'm so used to dealing with people like the gamesters of Triskelion always trying to rip me off.  But not the fine people at Priceline.  Well, if you're going away in the near future, you need a hotel room, give Priceline a call, 1-800-Priceline, or visit them on the web, Priceline.com, and you set your price for your hotel room, and they're going to take care of you. 
[00:08:30]  And if you use their service, they're going to give you a free hotel night.  You can't beat that.  With a black lube.  And if you need a flight, they're in that business as well.  You primitive people in your aircraft.  Yes, I remember from my history computer.  I understand you still have to travel by aircraft. 
[00:09:00]  But if you must, why not call Priceline?  Priceline.  Well, they saved me $350 on two tickets to Florida right after the holidays.  You and your dollars.  I deal in ignats.  Ignats?  That's my form of currency.  Okay, I see.  They saved me many ignats in the future.  I see that.  Priceline.  Priceline.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. 
[00:09:30]  Lenny Kravitz and Fly Away.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, Opie?  If you're thinking of flying this afternoon, you better check with your carrier.  Oh, there are a lot of cancellations and delays.  Oh, if you're looking to get away, like Lenny was just saying.  Wacky DJ Segway.  Oh, how many of those have you been hearing today?  Every song they come out of has to have something to do with the weather.  Yeah, I have an announcement to make.  Every single flight has been canceled for the next two days. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you.  Really?  Is that an official announcement, Opie?  Wow.  Well, what if someone's driving to the airport right now?  I would suggest you turn around.  I mean, we don't do too well when we broadcast the news, so I think maybe you ought to shut up.  Every single flight has been canceled today.  Go home and drink.  Okay.  That sounds good.  I like the sound of that.  I hope you don't get your news from Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  Listen for the sarcasm, everyone. 
[00:10:30]  We're up to four already today.  Did you hear it?  Yeah, I think I just heard something go by.  Sarcasm.  Hey, happy birthday to Faye Dunaway.  Now, how old is she?  Fifty-seven?  I think it was fifty-seven.  Fifty-seven years young today, huh?  Yeah.  No longer haggers ever!  God, I love that movie.  That movie gives me the creeps.  I saw it just over the weekend.  It was on TV.  And I giggle like an idiot watching that movie when she's just pounding on the kid, Christina, 
[00:11:00]  when she's a little kid.  It's hysterical.  Scrub, Christina!  Scrub!  They're in the bathroom with the comet on the floor.  Scrub!  Scrub!  And she starts hitting the kid with the comet.  Can?  Boom!  Boom!  And the kid's like,  And then the best part,  when she leaves,  Joan Crawford leaves the bathroom,  and she goes, 
[00:11:30]  What am I supposed to do?  And she looks back at the kid and goes,  Clean up this mess!  And the kid just goes,  Jesus Christ.  Now, Anthony,  it's the best movie.  We've been doing this show for about seven months.  Yeah.  And if you surveyed our listeners,  they would swear that I'm the crazy one.  Yeah.  Why is it that you find enjoyment out of dramas on TV?  You laugh at Bill.  The Mickey Rooney movie that's supposed to be a serious drama. 
[00:12:00]  You sit there and laugh like a little girl.  I laugh at the ones that are funny because they're so utterly bad.  Do you think Faye Dunaway's performance in that was good?  Or maybe just a tad over the top in her kabuki makeup.  Standing there with the wire hanger and the white powder on her face  and the big red lipstick going,  I get you nice dresses and you put wire hanger!  I mean, that stuff is great. 
[00:12:30]  We've got to get that clip for our show.  No wire hangers ever!  Ever!  Christina, get the axe!  I like when she cuts her hair.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  She's cutting hair.  And then another great scene when Christina gets a little older  and there's a writer over going to write this whole story on Joan  and the daughter's back from school  and Joan goes to her,  Why can't you give me the respect I get from any stranger on the street? 
[00:13:00]  And Christina goes,  Because I'm not one of your friends!  And they proceed to just beat the crap out of each other.  Oh, it's great.  You see, like, underwear and skirts are flying.  Oh, it's great.  They're choking each other.  You're a mess.  Oh, the movie's a classic.  So you just sit there and laugh.  Like a retard.  Yeah.  You were playing Half-Life last night.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was getting heavy into Half-Life.  The game is extremely bloody, extremely gory. 
[00:13:30]  And there were blood, guts, like organs from other people that were killed, splattered on the wall.  You were playing multiplayer.  Yeah, yeah, big pockmarks in the walls from bazookas and stuff.  And I typed in,  Christina, clean up this mess!  And, like, everyone in the room knew what movie it was from.  So you get the little LOL, you know?  Well, in honor of Fade Down Away,  57 years young today,  One more.  One more, a little.  No more wire hangers! 
[00:14:00]  Never more!  Happy birthday to you, Fade.  Godspeed, Fade.  Up to five.  Five sarcastic.  All right.  We got some bad company on the way.  Some Aerosmith and some Johnny Cougar next.  Little Johnny Cougar.  Let's just start calling him Johnny Cougar,  because everyone has seen the commercial now.  Yeah.  1027 WNEW,  the rock of New York,  Bad Company. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  Sophie and Anthony.  Anthony's struggling to get his headphones.  Well, the boss had his foot on my cord.  I think he was giving you a sign.  Are you going home early, boss?  I'm going home early.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Trying to beat that New Jersey traffic.  Oh, good luck.  He's got his balls in his hands,  and he's ready to go.  What do you got?  You want to elaborate on that?  Titleist?  I see you.  Oh, he stated the obvious.  You got your balls in his hands. 
[00:15:00]  All right.  It's great golfing weather.  I'm getting in my weekend mode.  Oh, yeah.  I may escape a little bit.  Oh, God.  That's got to be nice.  Just to be able to get out of this.  I may just be escaping to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina this week.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  I could be leaving Saturday morning.  It's got to be nice.  Just one of these days.  Well, it's tough.  You know?  I mean, you got to find your way to unwind.  Yeah.  You know?  It can be stressful.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:15:30]  I was just bummed.  But I wasn't deliberately stepping on your court.  Oh, I wouldn't think.  I wouldn't dream that you would do that on purpose, Godfather.  I can never tell when that music is playing or not.  What music?  They never give me headphones.  What music?  There's no music playing.  What are you talking about?  I often just hear music when I'm walking down the street.  Oh, no.  We don't have music in the background.  Just talking to our boss.  That's all.  Dave Herman sleeps with the fishes. 
[00:16:00]  So I was actually asked this morning by Steve Mason if the changes are done.  At the station?  At the station.  Oh, we hope so.  And they ran through the entire lineup.  Right.  The changes are done.  They're done.  So now we got a radio station to promote, finally?  We actually have an entire radio station to promote.  That's incredible.  I have no future whackings in order.  Nothing to be whacked anytime soon.  But do not cross me.  Your baseball bat got a workout the last seven months. 
[00:16:30]  Why isn't he laughing?  I know.  I am laughing.  He's laughing on the inside.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  You want to hear that crescendo that just came up in the music.  It's beautiful.  What did it say?  How did it go?  What music?  There's no music playing.  It doesn't have headphones on.  It doesn't have music, man.  No.  So.  All right, boss.  Thank you.  Well, enjoy the ride.  Thank you.  Are you going to be at our little pep rally tomorrow? 
[00:17:00]  Anthony doesn't like to call it a pep rally.  I just want to call it a big-ass party.  We're just going to have a huge party.  I think I paid for that bronco today.  Did you?  How much did we have to pay for that?  I think we're talking about like $750 to $800.  All right.  Just so we can beat the hell out of it.  I'm not even sure it has an engine.  I think we may have to tow it in.  Good for parts.  That's all right.  That's going to be cool.  Just like John Elway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No engine.  No engine has to be towed in.  That's what we're hoping for.  We've got to get to Elway early Sunday.  Go Jets.  Did you hear our Mike and the Mad Dog impression yesterday? 
[00:17:30]  No.  We'll have to do that a little later.  We'll do it for your ride home.  I'll be in the car for the next three hours.  Okay.  Just take your time.  A lot of people liked it.  I was surprised.  But tomorrow's the big Jet Pep rally at Manny's in Monocity, New Jersey.  You know where that is?  I do.  You do?  Not too far from the Meadowlands.  Exactly.  And it's a sports bar.  And we're going to be inside.  We're going to be outside with the Bronco.  We've got sledgehammers.  And we're going to beat the hell out of this Bronco game Sunday.  Are we going to raise some money for the Marty Lyons Foundation?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right. 
[00:18:00]  I just found out about that.  The former Jet?  Yes.  Very cool.  I think we're charging $2 a whack, and then we're going to turn the money over to charity.  That's fair enough.  That's good.  Sure.  And we're doing our whole show live.  So please come on out and support us.  We haven't been out yet.  It's our first time out.  Be gentle.  We haven't been out since Johnny Cougar.  That was like four months ago.  Johnny Cougar.  That was about four months ago.  It's like our debutante ball.  Yeah.  We want to see if people are actually listening to us.  Do you guys know what you're going to be wearing?  Are you going to lay out your clothes tonight?  Yeah.  I'm going to lay my clothes out.  Make sure I have a nice outfit.  It's like the first day of school. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Get my school bag.  We're kind of excited.  Yeah.  It's going to be fun.  We want to meet the people that are supporting us.  Yes.  The two or three people.  All right, boss.  Have a great day.  Do you want to call us on the road and be our traffic reporter today?  Sure.  All right.  Yeah, you could be a...  Well, I don't want to get it wrong.  No, that's CBS.  The cellmates.  What does Wins have?  The phone force.  The phone force.  The phone force.  Our 1010 Wins phone force calling in.  It's Bill on the Jersey Turnpike. 
[00:19:00]  Says there's traffic.  Thank you, Bill.  I love that.  We were listening to Wins on the way in today.  Yeah.  They got some wacky little street reporting going on.  Woo!  And here we came across Lisa in Times Square who likes this weather.  New York at its finest.  New York loves this weather.  I don't know.  You guys should talk to the people that really hate this weather.  That would be fun to listen to.  I wanted to talk to the guy I saw on the side of a building pumping insulation into a little hole from his truck. 
[00:19:30]  He didn't look like he'd have a happy word about this kind of weather.  Well, my wife is in charge of the class moms.  Yeah.  So, like, we get the call at 5 o'clock in the morning if school's closed.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And the New Jersey phone chain goes into effect.  It's one mom calling the next mom, calling the next mom, calling the next mom.  It's great.  That's what was great about growing up.  You know, the snow day. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Why can't we get snow days?  That would be so exciting.  Every day is a snow day.  Come on.  All right.  You're right.  Our lives are snow days now.  Okay.  You should call up and find out.  Is the station closed today when you have to come in?  It's the station closed.  All right.  We've got some Peter Gabriel on the way.  Some U2, Tom Petty, and Scott Herman, everyone.  1027 WNW.  The Rock of New York.  Peter Gabriel.  U2 before that.  The sweetest thing.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  And everyone's on the highways and byways trying to get home.  Is it still bad out? 
[00:20:30]  I don't even know.  I must say, we had a very easy ride in.  Yeah.  Well, an extremely easy ride.  When you come in in the afternoon like we do, a lot of people get scared.  They take the public transportation.  Opie almost fell for it.  Around noon, I'm like, all right, Opie, I'm coming over.  We're going in.  Are you sure?  You don't want to take the train.  Today's like a train day.  No, no, no.  I don't train.  I don't train. 
[00:21:00]  Because by noon, people have already been frightened into taking the train.  So now the roads are pretty clear, and the train sucks.  You know?  And then we're driving in.  We're listening to 1010 Winds, and what are they saying?  Roads are clear.  20-minute delays in Mineola for equipment problem.  All right.  So you won this battle.  Of course I did.  We've got to take the train every once in a while.  There's a lot of freaky people on the train.  You take the train.  I can see the freaky people from my windshield. 
[00:21:30]  There's a lot of them today.  If you're in the left lane and you're going 15 miles an hour, get the F out of the way.  You know, I'm not going to buy the argument of people calling up going,  hey, these maniacs with their sport utility four-wheel drives.  You know, you guys better come.  No, no, no.  Get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  This is the first year I have ever, ever owned a four-wheel drive.  And I'm behind people going 15, and I know I could do at least, oh, 30, you know? 
[00:22:00]  But they're in the way.  And it's not like they're in the granny lane.  No, they're in the left lane.  They're in the passing lane.  Just move to the right.  How many times do we see this?  Left lane clear, right?  You're buzzing right along.  Out of the middle lane comes somebody into the left lane.  All right, maybe they're passing somebody.  And then they don't go any faster than they were going in the middle lane.  They're not passing the vehicle that was in front of them.  Nothing.  They're just in my way.  And you were freaking out today.  We got to do the road rage thing again. 
[00:22:30]  We haven't done one of those in a while because you were in rare form today.  You're just flashing your high beams at this lady, and she's just like, what am I doing wrong?  You're right.  I was angry.  You were losing it.  And this lady couldn't understand why you were so ticked off behind her with your four-wheel drive car.  And she's in her pinto, I think it was, going 15 miles an hour in the passing lane.  I got the cow catcher thing on the front.  I got lights.  I'm shining.  I'm like, get out of my way.  So then we finally pass her, and she looks at us like, what is your problem, man? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, they give you that quick, like, you maniac look.  And I give them the quick, you asshole look, and we're on our way.  And then everyone moves on.  Move along.  All right.  We were going to talk about the Val Kilmer movie.  We can do that next, I guess.  Yeah.  But everyone is calling for the directions for our live broadcast tomorrow.  I'm getting very excited about this.  We're going to beat the hell out of a Bronco.  We got the Bronco.  We got the Sledgehammers.  We got the location.  It's Manny's Cocktail Lounge, the sports bar over there near the stadium.  And that's in Menachee, New Jersey.  We're going to be there from 3 to 7, beating the heck out of this Bronco and drinking lots 
[00:23:30]  and lots of beers and just having a good old time as we get psyched for the game on Sunday.  All right.  As I pull up the NEW website, Opie, on the front page, right there when you first get to it,  it says, details and directions, Opie and Anthony's Bronco blowout.  There you go.  There you go.  So go to the website, www.wnew.com.  A, T, T, S, Jets, Jets, Jets!  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, the Rock of New York, the Jets chant.  We got to get a winner here. 
[00:24:00]  And before that, REM from the Up CD, a song called Lotus.  Now we're just waiting for the phones to ring.  There they go.  Oh, there they go.  There they go.  All right.  Got that trip to see the game Sunday in Denver?  Mm-hmm.  Hi, N-E-W.  Hi.  J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets.  We've got a live one here.  How long did I win?  Well, you're supposed to wait until we do some of that small talk, right?  Yeah, we want to get to know you a little bit. 
[00:24:30]  And then we set you up and let you go.  You kind of shot your load there.  I'm not the 10th caller?  You're the 10th caller.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm in the running.  Okay, what's your name?  Joyce Clark.  All right, Joyce, where are you calling from?  I'm calling from Midtown.  I'm working?  Yes.  Where do you work?  I work at 685 Third Avenue.  Well, you don't have to give your address.  Just what do you do?  Oh, I'm the secretary.  This is the get-to-know-you portion.  Oh, okay. 
[00:25:00]  What color are your panties?  Well, you don't want to know them.  Yeah, sure.  Why not?  Yeah, why not?  They're white.  Oh, okay.  A conservative gal.  Very nice.  That's nice.  Every so often.  Okay, so you know what we're doing here?  Yes.  Okay.  Now, you're at work.  Yes.  Well, can you scream nice and loud?  I just did.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  I'm the receptionist here.  Oh, my God.  Whew.  Okay, that was great. 
[00:25:30]  What is that?  The booze store?  We're going to the liquor store.  Dipping into the inventory.  All right, answer that phone call.  Okay, hold on.  See what they want.  Go ahead.  Oh, we didn't want to be on hold.  I wanted to see what station they listened to on hold.  Okay, let's see.  Oof.  What is that?  That's got to hurt.  It's like that New Age stuff.  Is this from, like, Madam Butterfly? 
[00:26:00]  It's like from Madam Butterfly.  I guess you didn't realize.  I am back.  Oh, there you are.  That's some great music you got on hold.  I know.  It sucks.  What station is that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Is it?  Okay.  All right, we're going to give you another chance here.  You really got to scream because there are people out there that really want this chance  to go to Denver.  Now, you got to just let it go.  Let it go.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  There you go.  We can handle that one.  All right, hold on the line.  Rooks are going to qualify you.  Okay.  You get a Jets prize package.  We got a Jets sweatshirt.  And you'll be in the running for the trip that we draw tomorrow morning with Steve Mason,  okay?  Okay, good.  All right.  Are you guys coming to our pep rally tomorrow?  I'll try.  Oh, that means no.  No.  I've heard that before.  You're letting us down.  In the past.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, sure you will.  I don't want to try.  And I'm left standing there waiting, looking like the dorky kid that fell off the bridge in 
[00:27:00]  Saturday Night Fever.  All pathetic.  She's going to show up, right, Tony?  She's going to show up, right, Tony?  Right?  Look, Tony, Tony, I'm dancing, Tony.  Look, Tony.  Wait a minute.  I want to see you.  I just called up the other day, and I wanted to hear the B-52s.  Yeah, I'll play it.  Yeah, I'm still waiting.  Whoops.  Okay.  All right.  Touche.  No, we really play requests here, really.  No.  Yeah, when?  If you've got two weeks to wait.  All right.  We're doing the pep rally tomorrow.  We're broadcasting our show live from Manny's Cocktail Lounge in Monaki. 
[00:27:30]  Okay.  And we've got a Bronco, we've got sledgehammers, and everyone's going to come down, drink a  few beers, and beat the heck out of this Bronco.  Okay.  Does it sound like a good idea?  Yes.  Oh.  It's going to be fun.  I'm ready.  All right.  And we'll hopefully see you there.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on the line.  Okay.  Yeah, that's from 3 to 7 tomorrow.  Yeah.  She did a pretty good job.  She did.  They're getting better.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Led Zeppelin.  Metallica, before that, turn the page from Garage Inc. and Golden Earring 2, Twilight Zone, 
[00:28:00]  as you try to make your way home this afternoon.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We definitely appreciate that.  Yes, we do.  We do have our supporters, and we're going to see all you guys tomorrow at Manny's Cocktail  Lounge in Menachie, New Jersey.  Menachie.  We got the Bronco.  If you don't know what's going on by now, we're all very psyched for the game, obviously.  So we're going to do our show live tomorrow from Manny's, right near the stadium, from  3 to 7.  We got a Bronco.  We got sledgehammers.  And you get the chance to beat up the Bronco. 
[00:28:30]  It's fun for a Friday afternoon.  Yeah.  It's great.  And we're also going to raise money for Marty Lyon's foundation there.  For the terminally ill children.  And go figure.  All that fun and a good cause to boot.  Yes.  And you might be saying, yeah, but Opie and Anthony, it's going to stink tomorrow.  The weather's supposed to be bad.  That's why we picked a sports bar.  We're going to have fun inside, outside, all around.  Right.  So please make your plans to join us tomorrow from 3 to 7. 
[00:29:00]  And if you need to get there, you don't have directions, you can go to the  WNW website and they're right on the homepage there.  Just pop on.  Okay.  Easy enough.  All right.  Opie, did you see the view this morning?  I try not to make a habit of watching this.  Jen watches it.  She turns it on.  I'm trying to watch CNBC for my stock updates.  And she's always telling me, put the view on.  I want to see who's on the view.  Oof.  That's a tough watch. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Well, this morning, they have on the actual couple that inspired the movie at first sight.  With Mira Savino.  And Val Kilmer.  So they must look really hot.  No, no, there's no Val Kilmer.  No, no.  What about Mira Savino?  The real?  No, no, no.  Not even close.  You mean they're stretching the truth with this movie? 
[00:30:00]  Unbelievable.  Just heinous.  Now, what's the problem?  At first sight is where Val Kilmer, he regains his sight.  Regains his sight.  Yes, and sees how lovely the world is and how lovely Mira Savino is.  And it's all wonderful.  So it sounds like a great love story.  What's the problem?  Well, Opie, they don't look like Val Kilmer and Mira Savino.  Well, what do they look like, the real couple? 
[00:30:30]  They've got big, fat, goofy people.  I don't think he was all right in the head, either.  He was kind of in a ball, ball.  Basically, this guy's wishing that he didn't regain his sight.  Is that what you're getting at?  Yeah.  Is that what you're getting at, Anthony?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  And I think the wife wanted to gouge her eyes out.  And he was wearing that big wraparound sunglass thing like you see the old people wear in the Terminator. 
[00:31:00]  And he was kind of looking around like he still couldn't see.  So I don't know what it is.  They show Val Kilmer walking around.  He's fine.  Perfectly fine.  Yeah.  He's looking at everything.  I don't know.  Well, we got a picture of the lovely couple in the post today.  On page, what is that, 44?  Page 44, if you want to check it out for yourself.  Could have reunited Ernest Borgnine and Shelley Winters from the Poseidon Adventure if they wanted to really make them look authentic.  That's pretty much what I saw. 
[00:31:30]  That's pretty close.  Isn't it?  Yes.  Not that I got the picture in front of me.  It is.  Ernest Borgnine with the big wraparound sunglasses and Shelley Winters from the Poseidon Adventure.  Wow.  I was a swimmer.  I was a championship swimmer.  I love that movie.  That's a good one.  That's the real Titanic.  Yeah.  Yeah, the 70s Irwin Allen Titanic.  Yes.  None of that stupid storyline thing to get in the way of the action.  When she tries to swim underwater, that's a pretty funny scene. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Big, fat, Shelley Winters.  It looked like a scene out of SeaWorld, like Shamu.  Big, fat, Shelley Winters swimming underwater.  That's one of those movies when it's on TV, you can't pass it by.  You've got to watch for a while.  Yeah, it doesn't matter when you tune in.  No, red buttons and...  15 minutes left, you've got to watch.  Yes.  There's got to be a morning after.  Shut up, Nani. 
[00:32:30]  Is that a name?  Yes.  Oh.  All right.  We've got the Jets chant ready to go here.  That'll be your cue to call in.  212-757-1027 to win the chance to see the game live in Denver.  When are we giving away that trip?  Tomorrow morning at 8.30 with Steve Mason?  Yes.  The new guy?  Yeah, the new guy.  We finally have a lineup here at NEW?  We finally have a new guy.  It's not us.  There's a bunch of people that are...  Yeah, that's true.  Ralph's a new guy still.  Steve Mason's a new guy.  Yeah.  We're veterans now. 
[00:33:00]  The new morning show.  At seven months, we're veterans.  Yo, we certainly are.  This place, to be a veteran, you had to put in 30 years.  But, you know, the times have changed.  The veterans.  Yeah, we are.  We're veterans.  Shell-shocked.  Been on the front lines a little too long.  When do we get to start drinking on the air?  Yeah.  No, really.  That went on for years around here.  All right.  So, stick around for the Jets chant.  Make sure you call in to try to win that.  And we've got some great rock and roll on the way. 
[00:33:30]  We've got that new band, Indigenous.  Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  1027 WNAW, the rock of New York.  That's the band, Indigenous.  And now that you're gone, why are you doing that, Anthony?  I don't get it.  What were you saying about them?  It's a family of musicians.  From?  Three brothers and a sister from the Nakota Nation.  Hi, hi, hi, hi.  From South Dakota.  Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. 
[00:34:00]  They grew up on the Yankton Indian Reservation in South Dakota.  The Yank what?  Yankton.  Oh.  Yankton.  I don't know.  Indigenous.  I get the name now.  Yes.  They are Indigenous to this land, being Native Americans.  Correctamundo.  They are Indigenous.  I don't know.  I used to like, what was that Indian band back?  Blackfoot.  Blackfoot.  Yeah.  Yes.  Ah-woo-woo-woo.  Woo-woo. 
[00:34:30]  I like it.  Okay, cool.  Indigenous.  Sounds a little bit like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Yeah.  They got their roots in the blue.  Sounds a little bit like Buddy Guy, too.  There we go.  We played the Jets chant in there.  We need to get a qualifier for that trip to Denver for the game.  Mm-hmm.  And let's grab a phone line here.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  Who's this?  This is Bob Burke.  How's it going?  All right, Bob.  Where are you calling us from?  I'm calling from the 84th Precinct Detective Squad.  All right.  What's going on?  Hey, you watching MYPD Blue?  Oh, yeah, I do. 
[00:35:00]  What do you think of it?  I think it's pretty good.  Yeah?  Is it accurate?  Yeah, I think Sipwitz took lessons from me, actually.  I love that damn show.  Me, too.  Me, too.  Yeah, I'm glad I got through to you guys.  I really like what you're doing, man.  That's a good show.  Thank you.  We like what you're doing.  Okay, cool.  So we're even.  So you guys walk around with your butts exposed?  Only in the summertime.  We'll pick up that today.  With your butts exposed.  Isn't that an embarrassment to the precinct to see everyone's butt on NYPD Blue?  Yeah, really.  Did you see it on Tuesday?  Uh, I was on NyQuil. 
[00:35:30]  I think I fell asleep at 10.01.  They made a complete asshole out of Metaphy on Tuesday.  Did they?  Yeah, Sipwitz said it was funny.  Yeah, Sipwitz is funny, man.  Yeah.  I like when you're shaking down them skills.  That's right.  That's right.  It doesn't beat them hard enough, I think.  I'm going to beat your ass.  You don't tell me what I want to know.  I like that guy.  Definitely.  Definitely.  All right.  I guess we need you to do the Jets chant.  Absolutely.  All right.  Are you psyched?  I am psyched.  I'll be honest.  We've had some wimpy qualifiers today.  I was driving in. 
[00:36:00]  I heard that one girl driving into work, and I said, you've got to be quiet.  I was the guy that had to drive back on the road when you told everybody driving off the road.  Well, we let her slide because she was pregnant.  Yeah, she was pregnant.  That's right.  We didn't want her to pop a kid or nothing.  No, no, no.  Pop a little nugget out.  No, no.  I don't mean to get it.  Yeah.  I don't mean to get it.  All right.  What are you guys doing on the job tonight?  Anything fun?  Any drug bust or anything?  No, we don't do drugs.  We go out for the other kind of criminals.  You know, we let narcotics do the drugs.  Yeah. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, you guys are...  Which I did myself for four years, but I don't do that anymore.  Have you had any exciting stops lately?  Uh, well, let's see.  We had picked up some 15-year-old kid that was robbing everybody with a gun around here.  We picked him up recently.  Boy, you never heard of that.  Yeah, I didn't.  My two of my buddies caught him in the act with a gun screwed into some guy's ear on  the sidewalk.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they didn't shoot him, no.  I was really pissed off about that.  They just shoved the plunger up his butt when he came back to the basement?  What? 
[00:37:00]  I'm just asking the questions everyone wants to know.  Oh, come on.  We just throw all those things out after that happened.  We're not even...  The toilet's back up.  We're screwed.  We can't even have one in the building anymore.  You've got to roll up a newspaper and shove it down in there.  Exactly.  Use that as a plunger.  Get rid of all the plungers.  Get rid of all of them, man.  They're out.  They're out.  Now the nightstick works better anyway.  That's true.  The rib dents.  Oh, my God.  Jeez.  Oh, man.  You're even harsh for us.  For what?  You're even harsh for us. 
[00:37:30]  I love you guys.  We do.  Well, you know, I've been doing this for a while, so, you know, you get a little hard  over time.  Cool.  How long have you been on the job?  Fifteen years.  Fifteen?  Started out on the streets?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Up in Harlem.  Really?  Yeah, Harlem, East New York.  All the dumps.  All the good garden spots.  The garden spots in New York.  That's right.  I'll tell you, the better the ghetto, the more fun I had.  Just tell it like it is.  Yeah, man.  Keep it in real.  This neighborhood now is a little too soft for me.  You need some action. 
[00:38:00]  That's right.  We're going to get back into the action.  All right.  I guess it's time for your Jets chant.  Okay.  All right.  Whenever you're ready.  Okay.  Hold on.  Let me just adjust the phone proper way.  All right.  Okay.  Hold on.  J-E-T-S.  Jets.  Jets.  Jets.  Jets.  Jets.  Jets.  Yeah.  Now, see, I just got really excited.  Excited.  Awesome.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  All right, man.  There you go.  Very cool.  One of our boys out there. 
[00:38:30]  One of our men in blue.  That's it.  All right.  You had a good instant feedback about the Jets.  Yeah.  I have a couple.  Let's see.  First, I got to get this guy, Jim.  I don't approve or laugh at everything you guys do, but that lamb chop skit was one of  the funniest things I've ever heard.  That had to be one of the most tasteless, cruel things we've ever done.  The lamb chop.  Yeah.  I'd love to know what he doesn't approve of.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  This guy, James, has this whole thing how now the Jets are destined to win, and he proves 
[00:39:00]  his point.  Oh, let's hear this.  The Jets won Super Bowl III.  That was 30 years ago.  This is Super Bowl XXXIII.  Huh?  Huh?  That sounds good.  Come on.  The three thing?  Uh-huh.  That Super Bowl was in Miami.  Oh, yes.  So is this one.  Okay.  Weeb was the coach that season.  He died this season, and the players wear his name on their helmets.  Well, that's a little bit of a stretch, but we'll go with it.  He's going with it. 
[00:39:30]  We'll go with it.  Vinny's number 16.  You know how many points they scored in the game for Super Bowl XXX?  Sixteen, baby.  Sixteen.  Need I go on, he says.  Okay.  So he's proving Jets are destined.  That's it.  To win.  I thought he had a few more.  Well, maybe you've got to come up with more.  Okay.  It's a little, it's not exactly, uh, rocket science.  The grassy knoll.  Yeah, but like Kennedy's secretary.  Her name was Lincoln, and Lincoln's secretary was, um, Kennedy.  It was Kennedy.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  When I read that for the first time, that whole conspiracy thing, it freaked me out.  And, and Lincoln was banging Monroe, Maryland, a guy that was an actor back in, all right.  Hey, don't forget about our, uh, Jets party tomorrow at Manny's, the sports bar near the  stadium there, uh, in Menachie, New Jersey.  We got the directions for this place on the web.  Right.  WNEW.com.  We want everyone to be out there.  We'll be broadcasting live from three to seven.  We got ourselves a Bronco.  Rumor has it the thing's not running anymore. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Hopefully like the, the team.  So they're getting a toad out to this place.  Then we're going to hand all our faithful listeners sledgehammers.  And for $2 a whack, you get to beat the heck out of this Bronco.  But the money raise is going for a great cause.  Uh, proceeds go to the Marty Lyons Fund for terminally ill children.  So we'll raise some money and, and do something nice for once.  Good cause and a good time.  You know, this isn't one of those, you know, stiff, stupid radio guy things.  You know, we, we, we like having fun when we go out, especially to a sports bar. 
[00:41:00]  Damn it.  We're going to have some fun.  It's going to be ugly.  We'd like you to be there.  We're going to be partying indoors, outdoors.  So please try to, uh, make it by.  Right.  Because a lot of you guys have been asking, when are you guys going to leave the studio  and, and hang with us?  Well, we're coming out.  We're coming out tomorrow.  We're going to have a great, great time.  Also.  I just had to wait for my, uh, pistol permit, uh, to clear.  Now I can leave the building.  Also, I think like the first 200 people that, uh, pay to beat up the Bronco.  Yeah.  They win a, um, I beat up the Bronco Opie and Anthony t-shirt or something like that. 
[00:41:30]  Well, there you go.  So.  Worth the price of admission right there.  It's better than our pedophile t-shirts.  I know.  I've made it out there.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Van Halen, Jamie's Crying, and Eve Six before that with  Inside Out.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Appreciate it.  You know, one of our, uh, most popular guests thus far here at NEW.  Yes.  Has been Stephen Lynch.  Oh, yeah.  We get so much email on this guy.  It's incredible. 
[00:42:00]  Came in with his guitar and sang some, uh, very touching songs.  I believe he's going to make his second visit in the very near future.  He was supposed to come tomorrow, but I think we're going to have to reschedule because  we're doing that live broadcast from Manny's in, uh, Manaki tomorrow.  Yes.  The Jets rally thing we're doing.  Yeah.  More details on that if you don't know what's going on.  But, uh, so I think we'll get him in next week.  Good.  He's got a couple new songs that he wants to try out on us.  And I would take it that you have one queued up now. 
[00:42:30]  Yes.  24.  Oh, I see what you're getting at.  Yeah, like 30, well, 40.  Yeah, 36.  So she was 36 years old.  Hey, dude, alive is enough, okay?  Screw the number thing.  If she's even alive.  Wow.  That is pretty bizarre.  Yeah.  Hey, I got a new, um, telemarketer call.  You do?  Yes.  Well, you hate telemarketers.  Well, I think a lot of people hate telemarketers because they call at the stupidest times.  The things you don't need. 
[00:43:00]  And you can't get rid of them.  And you beg them, uh, to take you off their list.  And then no one listens.  And then I continue calling and harassing you.  So I've, uh, turned the tides a little bit.  And I mess with them back.  Yeah.  Um.  This lady.  Pretty good at this.  This lady.  This lady, Miss Williams, called me today.  Miss Williams?  Miss Williams.  Now, you know when you get a telemarketer calling the line and they have to read from a script?  Yeah.  Yeah, they all do that.  It is so obvious it's a script.  Like, hi, my name is Miss Williams and I'm calling from AT&T. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  You can just tell it's a script.  Uh-huh.  So my latest scam is to see how many times I can get them to start over or repeat their script.  This is what I do for fun before we do a radio show, Anthony.  So how successful were you?  Uh, pretty successful this morning.  Check this out.  This is Miss Williams.  I'm a notifying operator with Minimum Rate Pricing Incorporated, Long Distance Service.  This is an important offering notification.  What's your name?  Miss Williams.  Miss Williams.  Hi. 
[00:44:00]  Hi.  Okay, sir.  This is an important offering notification call for Credit Preferred AT&T.  Can you speak up?  I got a call.  It's hard to hear you.  Okay.  Sorry, sir.  This is an important offering notification call for Credit Preferred AT&T, MCI, and Sprint  users.  What?  This is an important offering notification call for Credit Preferred AT&T, MCI, and Sprint  users.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to speak up. 
[00:44:30]  This is an important offering notification call for Credit Preferred AT&T, MCI, and Sprint users.  Can you possibly shout that?  Excuse me?  Can you shout that?  Can I shout that?  Yes.  I am shouting it.  My ears are clogged.  Hello?  This is Miss Williams.  Hi, Miss Williams.  Hi.  I'm a notifying operator with a minimum rate pricing incorporated non-distance service. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, boy.  It's really hard to hear you.  Okay, sir.  Bye.  Hello?  Hello?  You have a fan in the ass.  That's great.  Fun with telemarketers.  Taunt her.  I like my meteorite call.  We can end the show with a meteorite call.  Dave Matthews Band on the Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW. 
[00:45:30]  What would you say?  Sorry about that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Just about out the dope.  Yeah.  Had a lot of fun today.  Thanks for checking us out once again.  Have some fun tomorrow.  Yeah.  We can't wait for tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the emails coming in.  My buddy, John, is writing, saying, hey, Opie and Anthony, I plan to attend the party  at Manny's on Friday.  Cool.  Thank you.  What happens if the weather's really bad and only three people show up?  Oh.  We'll look like complete idiots. 
[00:46:00]  Well, that can't happen.  That can't happen.  It's a sports bar.  We're going to be inside and outside.  He says, I'll bring everyone from work with me for some side-splitting laughs.  Cool.  That you guys are always known for.  See you Friday, John.  Thanks.  We are looking for a big turnout tomorrow.  We're going to have one hell of a party as we root the Jets on us before the damn Sunday.  Exactly.  Speaking of the Jets, we had a few emails about the worst Jets song ever recorded.  The YMCA one?  Wait.  I don't know.  The second one. 
[00:46:30]  They are equally as evil.  Equally?  I don't know.  I think so.  More email coming in about the one done to Jets by Paul McCartney and Wings.  Yeah, that one is really bad.  You want to hear it again?  We don't even know who did this.  Hey, wait a minute.  I smashed this.  Well, the other day.  They sent us another copy.  Oh, come on.  I swear to you.  This is a joke.  No, I'm serious.  They sent another copy. 
[00:47:00]  And a bunch of people said that they heard that there's a song worse than the YMCA one  that we were playing.  They're goofing on.  Well, everyone knows the YMCA one.  Go ahead.  Give them a taste of this, and we'll show you how evil this one is.  All right.  It's bad.  It starts off all right.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I can always remember long-suffering faces. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  With one set and go tight and they go at one and fifteen.  And Jess, you brought the tuna.  Not too soon.  Here comes the breeze.  Jess.  Jess.  Jess.  Just how you turned it around in a couple of seasons. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:48:30]  Melmore's a storybook here. 
[00:49:00]  He hands off to Martin.  The chief's on.  He gets the damn ball.  And Jess.  They won't stop eating labor.  Oh, Miami.  Till they win it all.  Oh, my God.  All right.  That could be worse than the YMCA.  That was definitely worse than the YMCA song. 
[00:49:30]  I'm flabbergasted.  I'm stunned.  Hey, people are trying to contribute to our show, Anthony.  Okay?  That's a toughie.  That's a tough one to sit through.  All right.  Tomorrow, please show up.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  It's Manny's in Menachie, New Jersey.  Three to seven.  Broadcasting live.  We've got a Bronco.  We're going to pass out some sledgehammers, and you get a chance to whack the Bronco.  Yeah.  There's going to be lots of drinking inside Manny's as well.  So, please stop on by and say hi. 
[00:50:00]  You know, aside from the whole Jets-Broncos thing, this is just a great FU Friday thing.  Mm-hmm.  You know, you're driving.  People piss you off.  What a better thing to do than to pull in, take a sledgehammer, and bash the crap out of a vehicle.  Oh.  I like it.  I want to do that every day driving home.  I like it.  I'm going to take a few stabs tomorrow.  I wish we could have sledgehammers in our car while we're driving.  I am going to pummel.  The Bronco.  Who gets the first shot? 
[00:50:30]  Because you know the first shot is going to be right to the windshield.  Oh, the coveted first shot.  I know.  Who gets the first shot?  Yeah.  How are we going to determine that?  I don't know if I would hit the windshield, though.  First shot?  No.  With a sledgehammer hitting a Bronco?  No.  Where would you go?  Because that's just the windshield.  That's glass or something.  That's something that would really make noise and dance.  Maybe just the fender.  Or the door.  Just cave the door in.  Wham!  Come on.  Come on.  It's good.  You've got to go window first.  Got to go window. 
[00:51:00]  Grill?  Headlights is, you know, like the 10th guy in gets the headlights.  The headlights is a good thing where you go, well, it looks like you got a couple of  violations here, boy.  What movie was that in?  It's like every bad southern Macon County line.  I mean, yeah.  They end up in jail for a year for wiper blades.  Yeah.  That's all how those prison chick films always start.  Oh, yeah.  They're all dirty girls in those prison movies. 
[00:51:30]  God, I love those movies.  They've got to make more from that genre.  Linda Blair broomstick.  That's all I had to say.  That movie was great.  Wow.  How do we get off of that subject?  I don't even know where we are.  Yeah, tomorrow.  Yeah, we'll see you down there.  And if you don't have directions, they are on the NEW website.  Yes.  Anthony, could you leave us with another clip from Mommy Dearest, you think?  Yes, yes.  That real good one you were playing in the middle of the jet zone that no one got to hear?  Yeah, I'm sorry. 
[00:52:00]  I should have done it during the break.  But, yeah, this is a cute one.  This was when she found the wire hangers in the closet, and she started bitching out Christina  about her dress.  That's a very lovely one.  Okay, please hold it.  I bought you beautiful dresses.  Oh, you'd treat them like a fish rod.  Happy birthday to you.  And what was the other one you played really fast? 
[00:52:30]  Right after that.  Was that the boardroom one?  No, this is just the classic.  No!  Oh, okay.  Wire!  Hi, guys! </pre>
