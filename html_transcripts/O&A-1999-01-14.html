<pre> I'm going to be a  W. A. W. The  New York brand new band on the music scene that's trained with the song free some skinner  before that.  That skinner goes out to a guy that requested it yesterday.  I pray he's still listening from yesterday.  Yeah.  All right.  You never know.  That's how lazy we are.  I really hope the guys listening because he called about 10 times yesterday.  I said, yeah, man, I'll get it on for you.  No, really.  I'll get it on.  Well, you did.  Finally.  Good afternoon, everybody.  I hope you're making it through with this snow ice, sleet, freezing rain. 
[00:30]
 Oh, it's snowing out.  Well, I don't think it's doing anything right now, is it?  No.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  I was watching TV and listen to radio all day today.  Yeah, they never broke in with any weather.  Yeah, no one really mentioned it.  I'm wow.  Really?  Oh, look at that.  It seems to be a little flake or two.  Huh.  Oh, it's going to be a tough ride home today, I guess.  I wish someone would have told me.  I would have prepared. 
[01:00]
 I would have ran to the store and got my canned goods just in case the lights go out today.  Batteries.  Put some sand in your trunk, Opie.  Check the elderly.  And be careful.  Make sure you don't leave your pets outdoors.  Yeah.  Bring your pets in because they get cold too, even though they have fur.  All right.  Well, look at that.  Little tips that we've heard all day long.  Oh, great.  I got to hand it to our marketing department here at NAW. 
[01:30]
 Yes.  This could be the first nice thing we've said about Roger and the rest of the gang in marketing.  Yes.  We went on the air yesterday and said that we want to have a Jets Pep rally.  We'll party for the boys.  We also said we need a Bronco.  Yes.  So we can beat the crap out of it with sledgehammers.  We're going to like tag it with spray paint.  Mm-hmm.  And then beat the crap out of it.  Anthony, I'm proud to say that we are going to be broadcasting live tomorrow from 3 to 7. 
[02:00]
 Isn't this great?  We're finally getting out.  They're finally letting us out of the studio.  Finally.  I guess we did something right.  Well, I wouldn't push it.  So where are we going to be?  Manny's Cocktail Lounge in Monocay, New Jersey.  Yes.  We're going to have a Bronco.  They had to buy a Bronco for us.  Can you believe this?  That's amazing.  I didn't realize we had a budget, but they bought a Bronco.  We're going to spray paint it.  We're going to hand out sledgehammers, and we are going to have a good old time.  We're going to get ready for the big game on Sunday. 
[02:30]
 It's going to look uglier than Elway's teeth.  Yes.  When we're done with it.  So we're encouraging everyone to join us tomorrow if you're a Jets fan, if you're a Giants fan,  if you just want to hang out and party, because the beer will be a-flowing.  Right.  All right.  If you need to figure out how to get there, we have the directions right on the website,  the WNEW website.  All right.  Cool.  So I applaud the marketing department.  Bravo.  Earl, were you part of that?  Sort of, yes.  All right. 
[03:00]
 Well, thanks, Black Girl.  Job well done.  All right.  We got lots to do.  We got the Jets chant ready to go.  When you hear that, that's your cue to try to win the trip to Denver for the game.  Yeah.  We've been doing this for the last few days, and I must say, I was listening to the W today,  and people are finally getting psyched and finally getting into it.  You hear some of these people?  Yeah.  They sound like stock-raving lunatics.  That's what we want to hear, though.  Exactly.  We want you to...  You know, we want to feel what you're feeling.  Blood come out.  That's right. 
[03:30]
 The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, Billy Squire.  Lonely as the night.  Days of the New Before That Touched Peel, and Stan.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hello.  And we played the Jets chant there, Anthony, so we've got to get another qualifier for  the trip to Denver to see the game.  All right.  We've got Barbara here online, too.  Let's see if Barbara can give us a good shout.  Barbara?  Yep.  How are you?  All right.  You heard the Jets chant?  Yep. 
[04:00]
 And you're ready to do a chant back?  We're ready to do a chant, okay.  Now, if you don't do it well enough, we're going to hang up on you.  We get very upset.  That's the chance I have to take.  We get very upset, and not only us, the real hardcore Jets fans go, oh, come on, I could  have done that better.  Yes.  So we need something like an A effort out of you.  Now, where are you now?  I'm at home.  Okay.  So you have no excuses, no losses around, nothing.  Right, right.  All right.  Here's Barbara, everyone.  Okay.  J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets. 
[04:30]
 Okay.  That must have been the wind up, that dead silence before she started.  Now, Barbara, people are driving off the road right now.  That has nothing to do with the ice.  Wow.  I can't be responsible for everything.  They're ticked off.  They need you to do it louder.  Louder, huh?  Yeah, like when your voice starts crackling.  Are you married?  Do you have kids?  I'm married and I got one on the way.  Oh, okay. 
[05:00]
 All right.  Our first new Jets fan is on the way.  All right.  We don't want you to go into premature labor here.  All right.  You think you could do it a little louder, though?  Okay, we'll try.  Okay.  Come on, Barbara.  Push, push, push, push, push, push.  J-E-T-S, Jets, Jets, Jets.  All right.  All right.  Very good.  Almost broke her water with that one.  That's the only reason we're going to let you slide.  All right.  Because you got the kid on the way.  But congratulations.  You got a Jets prize package, which is a Jets sweatshirt and a bunch of other things. 
[05:30]
 And we're going to be picking the winner of the trip tomorrow during Steve's show.  Okay.  New morning guy.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on the line.  Rick's going to get some info from you.  Okay, thanks.  There she goes, Barbara.  We're going to do that a few more times today, so keep listening, all right?  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.

Oh I see. I use my time warp to come back. In the future priceline will actually  have starships too. It's going to be fabulous. Well right now they're into airline tickets  and hotel rooms. They're pushing the hotel rooms right now. Mr. Shatner. Yes I'm so used

And if you need a flight they're in that business as well. You primitive people  in your aircraft. Yes I remember from my history computer. I understand you still have to travel 
[09:00]

That's my form of. Farency. OK I see. They saved me many Ignats in the future. I see  that. Priceline. Priceline. The Rock of New York one or two seven W.A.W. Lenny Kravitz 
[09:30]
 and fly away. Hey hey Anthony. Yes. All right. If you're thinking of flying this afternoon  you better check with your carrier. A lot of cancellations and delays. If you're looking  to get away like Lenny was just saying. Wacky DJ segue. Oh how many of those you've been  hearing today. Every song they come out of has to have something to do with the weather.  I have an announcement to make. Every single flight has been canceled for the next two 
[10:00]
 days. Thank you. Really. Is that an official announcement. Oh wow. Well what if someone's  driving to the airport right now. I would suggest you turn around. And we don't do too  well when we broadcast the news. So I think maybe you ought to shut up. Every single flight  has been canceled today. Go home and drink. OK. That sounds good. I like the sound of  that. I hope you don't get your news from Opie and Anthony. Yeah. Listen for the sarcasm  everyone. We're up to four already today. Did you hear it. Yeah I think I just heard 
[10:30]
 something go by sarcasm. Hey happy birthday to Faye Dunaway. Now how old is she. 57. I  think it was 57. 57 years young today huh. Yeah. No. I love that movie. That movie gives  me the creeps. I saw it just over the weekend. It was on TV. And I giggle like an idiot watching 
[11:00]
 that movie. When she's just pounding on the kid Christina when she's a little kid. It's  hysterical. Scrub Christina scrub. They're in the bathroom with the like comet on the  floor. Scrub. Scrub. And she starts hitting the kid with the comet. And the kid's like  baby. And then the best part when she leaves Joan Crawford leaves the bathroom and she 
[11:30]
 goes what am I supposed to do. And she looks back and the kid goes clean up this mess.  The kid just goes. Jesus Christ. Now Anthony it's the best movie. We've been doing this  show for about seven months. Yeah. And if you surveyed our listeners they would swear  that I'm the crazy one. Yeah. Why is it that you find enjoyment out of dramas on TV. You  laugh at Bill. The Mickey. The Mickey Rooney movie that's supposed to be a serious drama. 
[12:00]
 I sit there and laugh like a little girl. I laugh at the ones that are funny because  they're so utterly bad. Like you think Faye Dunaway's performance in that was good or  maybe just a tad over the top in our kabuki makeup. Standing there with the wire hanger  and the white powder on her face and the big red lipstick. Going I got you nice dresses  and the wire hanger. That stuff is great. We've got to get that clip for our show. 
[12:30]
 No wire hangers ever. Ever. Christina gets the axe. I like when she cuts her hair. Yeah.  What are you doing? She's got an air. And then another great scene when Christina gets  a little older and there's a writer over going to write this whole story on Joan and the  daughter's back from school and Joan goes to her. Why can't you give me the respect  I get from any stranger on the street? And Christina goes, because I'm not one of your 
[13:00]
 fans. And they proceed to just beat the crap out of each other. Oh it's great. You see  like underwear and skirts are flying in. Oh it's great. They're choking each other. You're  a mess. Oh the movie is a classic. So you just sit there and laugh. Like a retard. Yeah.  You were playing Half Life last night. Yeah. Oh yeah yeah. I was getting heavy into Half  Life. The game is extremely bloody, extremely gory. And there were blood, guts, like organs 
[13:30]
 from other people that were killed splattered on the wall. You were playing multiplayer.  Yeah. Big pock marks in the walls from bazookas and stuff. And I typed in Christina clean  up this mess. And like everyone in the room knew what movie it was from. You get the little  LOL you know. Well in honor of Faye Dunaway. 57 years young today. One more. One more little.  No more wire hangers ever! Happy birthday to you Faye. Godspeed Faye. Up to five. Five 
[14:00]

[14:30]
 Sophie and Anthony. Anthony is struggling to get his headphones. And the boss had his foot  on my cord. I think he was giving you a sign. Are you going home early boss? I'm going home  early. I'm trying to beat that New Jersey traffic. Oh good luck. He's got his balls  in his hands and he's ready to go. What do you got? You want to elaborate on that? Titleist?  I see ya. Oh he's stated the obvious. You got your balls in his hands. Alright. It's 
[15:00]

Look at you. Because you're leaving Saturday morning. It's got to be nice. It's one of  these days. Well it's tough. You know you've got to find a way to unwind. Yeah. You know  it can be stressful. Yeah. Alright. I was just bombed. But I wasn't deliberately stepping 
[15:30]
 on your cord. Oh I wouldn't think, I wouldn't dream that you would do that on purpose God  Father. I can never tell what that music is playing. What music? You never give me  headphones. What music? There's no music playing. I often just hear music when I'm walking down  the street. No we don't have music in the background. Just talking to our boss. That's  all. Dave Herman sleeps with the fishes. I was actually asked this morning by Steve Mason 
[16:00]
 if the changes are done. At the station? At the station. Oh we hope so. And they ran through  the entire line up. Right. The changes are done. They're done. So now we've got a radio  station to promote finally. We actually have an entire radio station to promote. That's  incredible. I have no future wackings in order for me to be whacked anytime soon. Yeah your  baseball bat. Do not cross me. Your baseball bat got a workout the last seven months. Why 
[16:30]
 isn't he laughing? I know. I am laughing. He's laughing on the inside. Oh okay. Yeah.  Wow you ought to hear that crescendo that just came up in the music. It's beautiful.  What did it say? What music? There's no music playing. Oh H-MAY on the music may. No. No  alright boss thank you. We'll enjoy the ride. Thank you. Are you going to be at our little 
[17:00]
 pep rally tomorrow? Anthony doesn't like to call it a pep rally. I just want to call it  a big ass party. We're just going to have a huge party. I think I paid for that Bronco  today. Did you? How much do we have to pay for that? I think we're talking about like  seven fifty to eight hundred dollars. Alright. Just so we can beat the hell out of it with  that. I'm not even sure it has an engine. I think we may have to tow it in. Good for  parts. That's alright. That's going to be fun. Just like John Elway. Yeah. No engine.  No engine has to be towed in. That's what we're hoping for. We've got to get to Elway  early Sunday. Go Jets. Did you hear our Mike and the Mad Dog impression yesterday? No. 
[17:30]
 We'll have to do that a little later. We'll do it for your ride home. I'll be at the car  for the next three hours so just take your time. A lot of people liked it. I was surprised.  But tomorrow is the big jet pep rally at Manny's in Monockey, New Jersey. Do you know where  that is? I do. Not too far from the metal lines. Exactly. And it's a sports bar. We're  going to be inside. We're going to be outside with the Bronco. We've got sledgehammers and  we're going to beat the hell out of this Bronco. Are you going to raise some money for the  Marty Lyons Foundation? Yeah. Oh, that's right. I just found out about that. The former jet? 
[18:00]
 Yes. Very cool. I think we're charging two dollars a whack and then we're going to turn  the money over to charity. That's fair enough. That's good. Sure. And we're doing our whole  show live so please come on out and support us. We haven't been out yet. It's our first  time out. We haven't been out since Johnny Cougar. That was like four months ago. Johnny  Cougar. That was about four months ago. It's like our debutante ball. We want to see if  people are actually listening. Do you know what you're going to be wearing? Are you going  to lay out your clothes tonight? Yeah, I'm going to lay my clothes out. Make sure I have  a nice outfit. It's like the first day of school. Get my school bag. We're kind of excited. 
[18:30]
 Yeah, it's going to be fun. We want to meet the people that are supporting us. Yes. The  All right, boss. Do you want to call from the road and be our traffic reporter today?  Sure. All right. Yeah, you could be a... I don't want to get it wrong. No, that's CBS,  the cellmates. What does WINS have? The phone force. The phone force. The phone force. Our  1010 WINS phone force calling in. It's Bill on the Jersey turnpike. Says there's traffic. 
[19:00]
 Thank you, Bill. I love that. We're going to listen to WINS on the way in today. They  got some wacky little street reporting going on. And here we came across Lisa in Times  Square who likes this weather. New York had its fun. New York loves this weather. I don't  know. You guys should talk to the people that really hate this weather. That would be fun  to listen to. I wanted to talk to the guy I saw on the side of a building pumping insulation 
[19:30]
 into a little hole from his truck. He didn't look like he'd have a happy word about this  kind of weather. My wife is in charge of the class moms. So we get the call at five o'clock  in the morning that school is closed. And the New Jersey phone chain goes into effect.  To one mom calling the next mom calling the next mom calling the next mom is great. That's  what was great about growing up. The snow day. Why can't we get snow days? That would 
[20:00]
 be so exciting. Every day is a snow day. Our lives are snow days now. Is the station closed  today? We've got some Peter Gabriel on the way. Some U2, Tom Petty and Scott Herman  everyone. 1027 WNW, The Rock of New York, Peter Gabriel, YouTube before that, The Sweetest  Thing. It's Opie and Anthony. And everyone is on the highways and byways trying to get  home. Is it still bad out? I don't even know. I must say we had a very easy ride in. Yeah, 
[20:30]
 well, an extremely easy ride. When you're coming in the afternoon like we do, a lot  of people get scared. They take the public transportation. Opie almost fell for it. Around  noon I'm like, all right, I'm coming over. We're going in. Are you sure? You don't want  to take the train. Today is like a train day. No, no, no. I don't train. I don't train 
[21:00]
 because by noon people have already been frightened into taking the train. So now the roads are  pretty clear and the train sucks. You know? And then we're driving in. We're listening  to 1010 WNW. What are they saying? Roads are clear. 20 minute delays in Mineola for equipment  problem. All right, so you won this battle. Of course I did. We've got to take the train  every once in a while. There's a lot of freaky people on the train. You take the train. I  can see the freaky people from my windshield. That's all I need today. If you're in the 
[21:30]
 left lane and you're going 15 miles an hour, get the F out of the way. You know, I'm not  going to buy the argument of people calling up going, hey, these maniacs are doing sport  utility four wheel drives. You know, you guys better come. No, no, no. Get out of the way.  I, this is the first year I have ever, ever owned a four wheel drive and I'm behind people  going 15 and I know I could do at least Oh, 30, you know, but they're in the way and it's 
[22:00]
 not like they're in the granny lane. No, they're in the left lane. They're in the passing lane.  Just move to the right. How many times do we see this left lane clear, right? You're  buzzing right along out of the middle lane. Come somebody into the left lane. All right.  Maybe they're passing somebody and then they don't go any faster than they were going in  the middle lane. They're not passing the vehicle that was in front of them. Nothing. They're  just in my way. And you were freaking out today. We got to do the road rage thing again. 
[22:30]
 We haven't done one of those in a while because you were in rare form today. You're just flashing  your high beams at this lady and she's just like, what am I doing? I was, I was angry.  You were losing it. And this lady couldn't understand why you're so ticked off behind  her with your four wheel drive car as she's in her pinto. I think it was going 15 miles  an hour in the casting lane. I got the cow catcher thing on the front. I got lights.  I'm shining. I'm like, get out of my way. So then we finally pass her and she looks  at us like, what is your problem? We got to give you that quick like you maniac look and 
[23:00]
 I give them the quick you asshole look and we're on our way. Then everyone moves on.  Move along. All right. We're going to talk about the Val Kilmer movie. We can do that  next I guess. Yeah. But everyone is calling for the directions for our live broadcast  tomorrow. I'm getting very excited about this. We're going to beat the hell out of a Bronco.  We got the Bronco. We got the sledgehammers. We got the location. It's a Manny's cocktail  lounge, the sports bar over there near the stadium and that's in a Minnaki, New Jersey. 
[23:30]
 We're going to be there from three to seven, beating the heck out of this Bronco and drinking  lots and lots of beers and just having a good old time as we get psyched for the game on  Sunday. All right. As I pull up the N.E.W. website, Opie on the front page right there,  when you first get to it, it says details and directions. Opie and Anthony's Bronco  blowout. There you go.

We do have our supporters and we're going to see all you guys tomorrow at Manny's Cocktail  Lounge in Wenaki.  New Jersey.  Wenaki.  We got the Bronco.  I don't know what's going on by now.  We're all very psyched for the game, obviously.  So we're going to do our show live tomorrow from Manny's, right near the stadium.  From three to seven.  We got a Bronco.  We got Sledgehammers.  And you get the chance to beat up the Bronco. 
[28:30]
 It's fun for a Friday afternoon.  Yeah.  It's great.  And we're also going to raise money for Marty Lyon's foundation there for the Terminal  of the Yale Children.  And go cause.  All that fun and a good cause to boot.  Yes.  I might be saying, yeah, but Opie and Anthony, it's going to, it's going to be stinking  tomorrow.  The weather is supposed to be bad.  That's why we picked a sports bar.  We're going to have fun inside, outside, all around.  So please make your plans to join us tomorrow from three to seven. 
[29:00]
 And if you need to get there and you don't have directions, you can go to the WODW website  and they're right on the home page there.  Just pop on.  Okay.  Easy enough.  All right.  Opie, did you see the view this morning?  I try not to make a habit of watching this.  Uh, Jen watches it.  She turns it on.  I'm trying to watch CNBC for my stock updates.  And she's always telling me, put the view on.  I want to see who's on the view.  That's a tough watch. 
[29:30]
 Yeah.  Well, this morning, uh, they have on the actual couple that inspired the movie at first  sight with Marissa Vino and Val Kilmer.  So they must look really hot.  No, no, there's no Val Kilmer.  No, no.  What about Marissa Vino?  The real, no, no, no, no, not even close.  You mean they're stretching the truth with this movie? 
[30:00]
 Unbelievable.  Just heinous.  Now, big fat.  Now, what's the problem?  That first site is where Val Kilmer, he regains his sight, regains his sight.  Yes.  And sees how lovely the world is and how lovely Marissa Vino is and it's all wonderful.  So it sounds like a great love story.  What's the problem?  Well, Opie, uh, they don't look like Val Kilmer and Marissa Vino.  Well, what do they look like, the real couple? 
[30:30]
 They've got big fat goofy people.  I don't think he was all right in the head either.  It's kind of, you know, a ball of all words.  Basically, this guy's wishing that he didn't regain his sight.  Is that what you're getting at?  Yeah.  Is that what you're getting at, Anthony?  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  And I think the wife wanted to gouge her eyes out.  And he was wearing that big wraparound sunglass thing like you see the old people wear in 
[31:00]
 The Terminator.  So, and he was kind of looking around like he still couldn't see.  So I don't know what it is.  They show Val Kilmer walking around.  He's fine.  Perfectly fine.  Yeah, he's looking at everything.  I don't know.  Well, we got a page, a picture of the lovely couple in the post today on page, what is that?  44?  Page 44, if you want to check it out for yourself.  Could have reunited, uh, Ernest Borgnein and Shelly Winters from the Poseidon Adventure  if they wanted to really, uh, make them look authentic.  That's pretty much what I saw. 
[31:30]
 That's pretty close.  Isn't it?  Not that I got the picture in front of me.  It is Ernest Borgnein with the big wraparound sunglasses and Shelly Winters from the Poseidon  Adventure.  Wow.  I was a swimmer.  I was a championship swimmer.  I love that movie.  That's a good one.  That's the real Titanic.  Yeah.  Yeah, the 70s Erwin Allen Titanic.  Yes.  None of that stupid storyline thing to get in the way of the action.  When, uh, when, when she tries to swim underwater, that's pretty funny. 
[32:00]
 Yeah.  Big fat Shelly Winters like a way.  It looked like a scene out of Sea World, like Shamu.  Big fat Shelly Winters swimming underwater.  That's one of those movies when it's on TV.  You can't pass it by.  You got to watch for a while.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter when, when you tune in.  No red buttons and 15 minutes left.  You got to watch.  Yes.  It's got to be a morning after.  Shut up. 
[32:30]
 Nani.  Is that a name?  Yes.  Oh, all right.  We got the jet stand ready to go here.  That'll be your cue to call in.  Two one two seven five seven one oh two seven to win the chance to see the game live in Denver.  When are we giving away that trip?  Tomorrow morning at eight thirty with Seamason.  Yes.  The new guy?  Yeah, the new guy.  We finally have a lineup here at N.E.W.  We finally have a new guy.  It's not us.  We're not.  There's a bunch of people that are, are.  Yeah, that's true.  Ralph's a new guy still.  Steve Mason's a new guy.  Yeah.  We're veterans now. 
[33:00]
 The new morning show.  At seven months, we're veterans.  Yo, you certainly are.  This place to be a veteran, you had to put in 30 years.  But you know, the times have changed.  The veterans.  Yeah, we are.  We're veterans.  Shell shocked.  Get on the front lines a little too long.  When do we get to start drinking on the air?  I know, really.  That went on for years around here.  All right.  We're going to have to get a little bit of a break.  We're going to have to get a little bit of a break.  We're going to have to get a little bit of a break.  We got some great rock and roll on the way. 
[33:30]
 We got that new band, Indigenous.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,  say, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah 
[34:00]
 yeah yeah the yankton indian life  korean riot  being Native Americans.  Correctamundo.  They are indigenous.  I used to like, what was that engine band?  Back at Blackfoot.  Blackfoot, yeah.  I like it.  Okay, cool.  Indigenous. 
[34:30]
 Sounds a little bit like Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Yeah.  They got their roots in the blues.  Sounds a little bit like Buddy Guy too.  We played the Jets Chan in there.  I think we need to get a qualifier for that trip to Denver for the game.  And let's grab a phone line here.  Hi, N-E-W.  Hey, how are you doing?  All right, who's this?  This is Bob Buck.  How's it going?  All right, Bob, where are you calling us from?  I'm calling from the 84th Precinct Detective Squad down in Denver.  All right.  What's going on?  Hey, you watching my PD Blue?  Oh, yeah, I do.  What do you think of it? 
[35:00]
 I think it's pretty good.  Yeah?  Is it accurate?  Yeah, I think, yeah, I think it's a question for me actually.  I love that damn show.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm glad I got 3D guys.  I really like what you're doing, man.  That's a good show.  We like what you're doing.  Okay, cool.  So we're even.  Do you guys walk around with your butts exposed?  Only in the summertime.  We'll have to tell that today.  With your butts exposed.  Isn't that an embarrassment to the precinct to see everyone's butt on NYPD Blue?  Yeah, really.  Did you see it on Tuesday?  I was on NyQuil. 
[35:30]
 I think I fell asleep at 10-0-1.  You gave me a complete asshole out of MetaVoy on Tuesday.  Did they?  Yeah, Sipowicz said it was funny.  Yeah, Sipowicz is funny, man.  I like when you're shaking down him scales.  That's right.  I'm going to beat him hard enough, I think.  I'm going to beat your ass.  You don't tell me what I want to know.  I like that guy.  Definitely.  I guess we need you to do the Jets chant.  Absolutely.  Are you psyched?  I am psyched.  I'll be honest.  We've had some wimpy qualifiers today.  I was driving in. 
[36:00]
 I heard that one girl driving into work and I said, you've got to be driving.  I was the guy who had to drive back on the road when you told everybody to drive off  the road.  We let her slide because she was pregnant.  Yeah, she was pregnant.  We didn't want her to pop a kid or nothing.  No, no, no.  Pop a little nugget out.  Yeah, that would be pretty good.  All right.  What are you guys doing on the job tonight?  Anything fun?  Any drug busts or anything?  No, we don't do drugs.  We go out for the other kind of criminals.  We let narcotics do the drugs. 
[36:30]
 Which I did myself for four years, but I don't do that anymore.  Have you had any exciting stops lately?  Well, let's see.  We had picked up some 15-year-old kid that was robbing everybody with a gun around here.  We picked him up recently.  Boy, you never heard of that.  I did too.  My buddies caught him in the act with a gun screwed into some guy's ear on the sidewalk.  Really?  Yeah, they didn't shoot him though.  I was really pissed off about that.  Did he shove the plunger up his butt when he came back to the prison?  What?  I'm just asking the questions everyone wants to know. 
[37:00]
 Come on.  We got all those things out after that happened.  When that even the toilets back up, we're screwed.  We can't even have one in the building anymore.  You've got to roll up a newspaper and shove it down in there.  That is a plunger.  Get rid of all the plungers.  All of them, man.  They're out.  They're out.  Now the nightstick works better anyway.  That's true.  You're ripped in.  Oh my God.  Geez.  You're even harsh for us.  You're what?  You're even harsh for us.  I love you guys. 
[37:30]
 We do.  I've been doing this for a while, so you know you get a little hard over time.  How long have you been on the job?  15 years.  15 started out on the streets?  Oh yeah.  I've been up in Harlem.  Really?  Yeah, Harlem, East New York.  All the dumps.  All the good garden spots.  All the good garden spots in New York.  That's right.  I'll tell you, the better the ghetto, the more fun I had out there.  Just tell it like it is.  Keeping it real.  This neighborhood now is a little too soft for me.  You need some action. 
[38:00]
 That's right.  We're going to get back into the action.  All right.  I guess it's time for your Jets chant.  Okay.  All right.  Whenever you're ready.  Okay.  Hold on.  Let me just adjust the phone properly.  There you go.  All right.  Hold on.  J-E-T-S.  Jets, Jets, Jets.  Kick those asses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  I just got really excited.  Awesome.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  All right, man.  There you go.  Very cool.  One of our boys out there.  One of our men in blue. 
[38:30]
 That's this.  All right.  You had a good instant feedback about the Jets.  Yeah.  I have a couple.  Let's see.  First, I got to get this guy Jim.  I don't approve or laugh at everything you guys do, but that lamb chop skit was one of  the funniest things I've ever heard.  That had to be one of the most tasteless, cruel things we've ever done.  The lamb chop, yes.  I'd love to know what he doesn't approve of.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So, he's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things. 
[39:00]
 He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  He's got a couple of things.  Oh, yeah.  So is this one.  Okay.  Wee was the coach that season.  He died this season and the players wear his name on their helmets.  So, that's a little bit of a stretch.  We'll go with it. 
[39:30]
 We'll go with it.  Vinny is number sixteen.  You know how many points they scored in game three?  Sixteen, baby.  Sixteen.  Need I go on, he says.  Okay.  So, he's proving Jets are destined.  That's it.  To win.  I thought he had a few more.  Maybe you've got to come up with more.  Okay.  It's a little...  It's not exactly rocket science.  The grassy knoll.  Yeah, but like Kennedy's secretary.  Her name was Lincoln and Lincoln's secretary was Kennedy.  Kennedy.  Yeah. 
[40:00]
 When I read that for the first time, that whole conspiracy thing, it freaked me out.  And Lincoln was banging Monroe Maryland, a guy that was an actor back in...  Hey, don't forget about our Jets party tomorrow at Manny's, the sports bar near the stadium  in Monocay, New Jersey.  We got the directions for this place on the web.  W-A-W.com.  We want everyone to be out there.  We'll be broadcasting live from three to seven.  We got ourselves a Bronco.  Rumor has it the thing's not running anymore. 
[40:30]
 Yeah.  Hopefully like the team.  So they're getting a toad out to this place.  Then we're going to hand all our faithful listeners sledgehammers.  And for two dollars a whack, you get to beat the heck out of this Bronco.  But the money raised is going for a great cause.  Proceeds go to the Marty Lyons fund for terminally ill children.  So we'll raise some money and do something nice for once.  Good cause and a good time.  This isn't one of those stiff, stupid radio guy things.  We like having fun.  When we go out, especially to a sports bar, damn it, we're going to have some fun. 
[41:00]
 It's going to be ugly.  We'd like you to be there.  We're going to be partying indoors, outdoors.  So please try to make it by.  Right.  Because a lot of you guys have been asking, when are you guys going to leave the studio  and hang with us?  Well, we're coming out.  We're coming out tomorrow.  We're going to have a great, great time.  Also, I'm going to wait for my pistol permit to clear.  Now I can leave the building.  Also, I think the first 200 people that pay to beat up the Bronco, they win a I beat up  the Bronco, Opium Anthony t-shirt or something like that. 
[41:30]
 Well, there you go.  So.  It's worth the price of admission right there.  It's better than our pedophile t-shirt.  I know.  I made it out there.  One of the seven W and W the rock of New York, Van Halen, Jamie's crying and Eve six before  that with inside out.  It's opium Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Appreciate it.  You know, one of our most popular guests thus far here at any W has been Steven Lynch.  Oh yeah.  We get so much email on this guy.  It's incredible. 
[42:00]
 And then with his guitar and sang some very touching songs.  I believe he's going to make his second visit in the very near future.  He was supposed to come tomorrow, but I think we're going to have to reschedule because  we're doing that live broadcast from Manny's in Manaki tomorrow.  Yes.  The Jets rally thing we're doing.  Yeah.  More details on that if you don't know what's going on.  But so I think we'll get him in next week.  Good.  He's got a couple new songs that he wants to try out on us.  And I would take it that you have one queued up now. 
[42:30]
 Yes.  24.  Oh, I see what you're getting at.  Yeah, like third.  Well, 30.  Yeah, 36.  He was 36 years old.  Dude, alive is enough.  Screw the number thing.  If she's even alive.  Wow.  That is pretty bizarre.  Yeah.  Hey, I got a new telemarketer call.  You do.  Yes.  Well, you hate telemarketers.  Well, I think a lot of people hate telemarketers because they call at the stupidest times.  The things you don't need.  And you can't get rid of them and you beg them to take you off their list and no one 
[43:00]
 listens.  And then they continue calling and harassing you.  So I've turned the tides a little bit and I mess with them back.  Yeah.  This lady.  Pretty good at this.  This lady.  This lady, Miss Williams called me today.  Miss Williams.  Miss Williams.  Now, you know, when you get a telemarketer call on the line and they have to read from  a script, they all do that.  It is so obvious.  It's a script like, Hi, my name is Miss Williams and I'm calling from AT&T. 
[43:30]
 Right.  You can just tell it's a script.  So my latest game is to see how many times I could get them to start over or repeat their  script.  This is what I do for fun before we do a radio show.  Anthony, how successful are you?  Pretty successful this morning.  Check this out.  I'm a notifying operator with minimum rate pricing, long distance service.  This is an important offering notification.  What's your name?  Miss Williams.  Miss Williams.  Hi. 
[44:00]
 Hi.  This is an important offering notification call for credit preferred AT&T.  Can you speak up?  I got a call.  It's hard to hear you.  OK, sorry.  This is an important offering notification call for credit preferred AT&T MCI and Sprint  users.  What?  This is an important offering notification call for credit preferred AT&T MCI and Sprint  users.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, you guys speak up.  This is an important offering notification call for credit preferred AT&T MCI and Sprint 
[44:30]
 users.  Can you possibly shout that?  Excuse me?  Can you shout that?  Can I shout that?  Yes.  I am shouting it.  My ears are clogged.  Hello?  This is Miss Williams.  Hi, Miss Williams.  Hi.  I'm Miss Williams.  Hi.  I'm Miss Williams.  Hi.  This is Miss Williams.  Hi, Miss Williams.  Hi.  I'm a notifying operator with Minimum Rate Casing Incorporated Non-Distance Service. 
[45:00]
 Oh boy, it's really hard to hear you.  OK, sir, bye.  Hello?  That's a pain in the ass, that's great.  Son of a telemarketer, it's on her.  I like my media right call.  We can end the show with a meteorite call.  J Matthews Band on the Rock of New York 1027 WNEW. 
[45:30]
 What would you say?  Sorry about that.  Soapy and Anthony.  Just about out of the dope.  Yeah.  Had a lot of fun today.  Thanks for checking us out once again.  We'll have some fun tomorrow.  Yeah we can't wait for tomorrow.  Oh yeah look at the emails coming in.  My buddy John is writing saying, hey, I hope Anthony, I plan to attend the party at Manny's  on Friday.  Well thank you.  What happens if the weather is really bad and only three people show up?  Oh we'll look like complete idiots. 
[46:00]
 Well that can't happen.  That can't happen as a sports bar.  We're going to be inside and outside.  He says I'll bring everyone from work with me for some side splitting laughs.  Cool.  That you guys are always known for.  See you Friday John.  Thanks.  We are looking for a big turnout tomorrow.  We're going to have one hell of a party as we route the Jets on us before the game Sunday.  Exactly.  Speaking of the Jets, we had a few emails about the worst Jets song ever recorded.  The YMCA one?  Wait, I don't know the second one. 
[46:30]
 No they are equally as evil.  Equally?  I don't know.  I think so.  More email coming in about the one done to Jets by Paul McCartney and Wings.  Yeah that one is really bad.  Do you want to hear it again?  We don't even know who did this.  Wait a minute, I smashed this.  Well, they sent us another copy.  Come on.  I swear this is a joke.  No, I'm serious.  They sent another copy. 
[47:00]
 And a bunch of people said that they heard that there is a song worse than the YMCA one  that we were playing.  They goofed it on.  Everyone knows the YMCA one.  Go ahead, give them a taste of this and we'll show you how evil this one is.  Alright.  It's bad.  Alright.  Starts off alright.  Oh.  Yeah.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright. 
[47:30]
 Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Alright.  Uh.  Not too soon.  Here comes Bill Greene!  Yes!  Yeah.  Tap.  Uh. 
[48:00]
 Is he being real?  Uh.  Uh.  And Jack-  Oh.  Hey, San Marcos! It's time to win!  Oh!  And then suffer the death!  What?  Yes!  It's only half over.  Oh my god.  God damn it!  I am God Will Miss Slap Hill with! 
[48:30]
 God damn it!  Oh my god, you killed me!  You're a fucking ball-killer!  I was beaten like a fucking ball!  Oh my god!  Oh, the jam. 
[49:00]
 They won't stop in Denver!  On Miami!  Till they win it all!  Alright, that could be worse than the YMCA.  It was definitely worse than the YMCA song. 
[49:30]
 I'm flabbergasted. I'm stunned.  Hey, people are trying to contribute to our show, Anthony.  Okay?  That's a toughie.  That's a tough one to sit through.  Alright, tomorrow, please show up.  We're going to have a lot of fun.  It's Manny's in Monocay, New Jersey.  Three to seven, broadcasting live.  We got a Bronco.  We're going to pass out some sledgehammers  and you get a chance to whack the Bronco.  And there's going to be lots of drinking inside Manny's as well.  So please stop on by and say hi. 
[50:00]
 You know, aside from the whole Jets, Broncos thing,  this is just a great FU Friday thing.  You know, you're driving.  You drive in, people piss you off.  What a better thing to do than to pull in,  take a sledgehammer and bash the crap out of a vehicle.  Oh, I like it.  I want to do that every day driving home.  I like it.  I'm going to take a few stabs tomorrow.  I wish we could have sledgehammers in our car.  I am going to pummel the Bronco.  Who gets the first shot? 
[50:30]
 Because you know the first shot is going to be right to the windshield.  Oh, the coveted first shot.  I know. Who gets the first shot?  How are we going to determine that?  I don't know if I would hit the windshield though.  First shot?  No.  With a sledgehammer hitting a Bronco?  No.  Where would you go?  Because that's just the windshield.  That's glass or something.  Something that would really make noise and dent.  Maybe just the fender.  Or the door.  Just cave the door in.  Come on.  Come on. It's good.  You've got to go window first.  Got to go window.  Headlights? 
[51:00]
 Grill?  Headlights is like the tenth guy in against the headlights.  The headlights is a good thing the way you go.  Well, it looks like you've got a couple of violations here, boy.  What movie was that in?  It's like every bad southern...  Southern county line.  Yeah.  They end up in jail for a year for wiper blades.  Yeah.  That's how those prison chick films always start.  Oh yeah.  They're all dirty girls in those prison movies. 
[51:30]
 God, I love those movies.  They've got to make more from that genre.  Linda Blair Broomstick.  That's all I have to say.  That movie was great.  Wow.  How do we get off of that?  I don't even know where we are.  Tomorrow.  Yeah, we'll see you down there.  And if you don't have directions, they are on the N.E.W. website.  Yes.  Anthony, could you leave us with another clip from Mommy Dears, you think?  Yes, yes.  That real good one you were playing in the middle of the jet song that no one got to hear?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I should have done it during the break. 
[52:00]
 But yeah, this is a cute one.  This was when she found the wire hangers in the closet and she started bitching out Christina  about her dress.  Yes, very lovely one.  Okay, please hold.  I bought you beautiful dresses.  I'm a traitor like I got down there.  Fish Rod.  Happy birthday to you.  What was the other one you played really fast? 
[52:30]
 Right after that.  Was that the boardroom one?  This is just the classic.  No wire hangers! </pre>
