<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast extensively covered the Don Imus controversy following his remarks about the Rutgers women's basketball team.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, vehemently criticized Imus's suspension, deeming it disproportionate and a violation of free speech. They repeatedly attacked Reverend Al Sharpton, calling him a "media whore" and accusing him of exploiting the situation for personal gain, drawing parallels to the Tawana Brawley case.  The show heavily debated the racism inherent in Imus's "nappy-headed hoe" comment, comparing it to other controversial statements by comedians like Michael Richards and exploring a perceived double standard regarding racially charged language on black radio.  Technical difficulties with the phone lines provided recurring comedic fodder.  Audio clips from Imus's appearances on Sharpton's show and the Today Show were played, along with commentary from figures like Whoopi Goldberg and Jesse Jackson.  A recurring comedic bit involved a parody song about Sharpton.  A caller, Andy, supported the hosts' stance, arguing comedians shouldn't face the same scrutiny as network news.  The hosts also discussed the potential repercussions for their own show, including cancellation.  They encouraged listeners to submit examples of racially charged comments from black radio to highlight the perceived double standard.

The broadcast included extensive analysis of Imus's appearances on Sharpton's show and the Today Show, featuring audio clips of his apologies.  The hosts debated the appropriateness of Imus's "you people" comment and the public's response.  They noted that some basketball players celebrated Imus's suspension. Cal Ripken Jr.'s cancelled appearance on Imus's show was also discussed.  The show featured frequent use of offensive language, including racial slurs and misogynistic terms.  The hosts speculated on Imus's potential consequences, from suspension to termination.  A call from Whoopi Goldberg ensued, where she debated the hosts' views on free speech in comedy. The hosts mentioned upcoming events, including a Las Vegas show and an HBO special.

A subsequent segment focused on Whoopi Goldberg's condemnation of Imus, with the hosts challenging her hypocrisy by referencing her past defense of Ted Danson's blackface incident.  Goldberg repeatedly hung up on them.  The hosts continued their mockery of Goldberg and Sharpton.  The discussion then shifted to an interview with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost promoting *Hot Fuzz*.  While initially touching on the Imus situation and contrasting American and British sensitivities regarding race and comedy, the conversation broadened to include comedy, cultural differences, and the film's production.  Numerous callers contributed to the conversation, and the segment was punctuated by crude and sexually suggestive remarks.

Another segment speculated on the reasons behind Imus's relatively lenient two-week suspension, citing his charitable work, political connections, and the show's high advertising revenue.  The hosts played various audio clips, including Imus's interviews on the Today Show, where he expressed contrition, and Sharpton's comments criticizing the insufficient suspension.  The hosts interjected with sarcastic remarks and jokes, often targeting Imus's weight and using offensive language.  They discussed Imus's past controversial statements, stretching back twenty years, and compared his situation to other public figures.  They also made jokes about Al Roker's weight. A caller, Shruggy, questioned the hosts' past controversial behavior and their right to comment on Imus given their history.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the Imus controversy and offensive jokes.

The final segment discussed the differing reactions to Imus's comments compared to similar incidents involving Jesse Jackson and his use of "Hymietown."  They questioned the double standard, emphasizing Imus's comedic context versus Jackson's presidential candidacy.  A clip from Meredith Vieira was played. The hosts then boasted about their low ratings in some markets as a defiant gesture against Howard Stern, whom they accused of jealousy and hypocrisy.  Clips of Stern were played, along with disparaging comments about Tim Sabean.  A tense phone call with Whoopi Goldberg ensued, ending with her hanging up.  The segment included numerous instances of highly offensive language, concluding with a humorous, and inappropriate, attempt to have two staff members touch butts on camera.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  What? What is this?  Garbage!  You know what? I can't take this anymore. It's an awful, awful radio show.  We're really, really mean-spirited, evil people who can't see the good in anything.  I think we've done a good job so far of being open-minded and broad-minded.  You know, like when you try to call the police when I touch you.  I don't call the police. I just pretend because it makes you touch me a little harder. 
[00:00:30]  Oh, God.  Excellence in broadcasting.  It's too bad you've got to have some form of intelligence to listen to the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's be honest, you probably didn't graduate high school.  You probably have three or four kids, and you're probably a grandma at the age of 32.  So I guess we have to give that much to you.  Tanya, I'd like to apologize if I were here.  Apologize. Go away.  Jail is better than this misery I'm in. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony.  I just think Nazi, and I can't get it out of my head.  Jim Norton.  Hilarious! Hilarious people!  You guys ready to laugh?  It's got to be the greatest thing ever.  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Barrier! Barrier! Barrier! Barrier! Barrier! Barrier! Barrier! 
[00:01:30]  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, man. You rock.  Wasn't queued up today.  Had to play it from another machine.  Yeah.  That's the kind of day we're going to have today.  Let's say hi to Dan in the Poconos.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Dan, what's going on today?  Hey, boys.  Long time for...  Hey there, Dan.  What's up, Dan?  I like calling him Dan the Man whenever a Dan calls. 
[00:02:00]  It's funny that way.  Dan the Man.  Is Dan there?  Do we have phones that work today?  Oh.  I'm right here.  That's a good question.  Anything?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I almost hear something.  Hello?  How about we have effing phones that work today?  Hmm.  That would be important.  Dan in the Poconos.  Yes? 
[00:02:30]  I won't hear him.  I'm right here.  Did you try John?  Just to see if a phone works?  Or if it was Dan?  What button needed to be pushed down?  John?  Hello?  Yeah, there you are.  And now we lost Dan.  We lost Dan.  Everyone's going to eff themselves.  Can we get a studio that is set to go for it?  Apparently, no.  Oh, it's this button.  Oh, great.  That's wonderful.  Dan was going to set up the whole show.  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thanks for nothing.  Well, thanks for nothing.  Why don't you try calling back, Dan?  God.  Oh, it's this button.  Well, great.  How about you see that it's that button before we get in here?  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We're fired up today, obviously.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  And we want to make it perfectly clear that we completely support Don Imus.  I am outraged.  Completely support Don Imus.  You're waking up to the news that he's been suspended for two weeks. 
[00:03:30]  Two weeks.  Two weeks for a dumb comment on a comedy show.  Starting what?  Next Monday.  Monday?  Yeah, next Monday.  And everyone's like, wow, why is the suspension starting next Monday?  Well, because it was scheduled that Mr. Imus would be raising money for sick kids all this week.  For sick kids.  Because, you know, what a scumbag that he is.  Right.  He's going to be raising money for sick kids like he does every year. 
[00:04:00]  This is one of his big charities that he works on every year.  And this whole situation is disgraceful.  And I don't mean what Imus did.  Obviously, he's apologized for it.  And I even think a lot of people you see apologize and they don't care.  They're not sincere.  I really think Imus is sincere as far as his apology goes.  I think he's going too far with it.  It's like Imus.  Apologize and then shut up. 
[00:04:30]  Leave it alone.  But I think he was absolutely sincere.  And they are just not letting off on this.  Oh, what do you mean by they?  They?  What do you mean by they, Anthony?  What do you mean by they?  I mean those people.  What do you mean by those people?  Well, I mean exactly what Imus should have said when he was asked the same question.  The black people that are upset with him.  Because that's what it is.  Reverend Al is a media whore.  And let me tell you, this is not news to anybody. 
[00:05:00]  He has been for years.  How in the past few years this guy has shoveled up an ounce of credibility where he now has some kind of platform and a voice where when he talks people actually listen to him and don't go,  Oh, this fat idiot again is on the news exploiting somebody for his own advancement?  When did that happen?  When did Reverend Al get an ounce of credibility in this country and especially in the city of New York? 
[00:05:30]  Well, Imus gave him some credibility yesterday by going on his show.  That was a mistake.  Who told Imus to go on Reverend Al Sharpton's radio show?  Nothing good was going to come of that no matter what.  And then Reverend Al marching his daughter out.  What does his daughter have to do with anything?  It was like I was watching an old McCarthy communist hearing. 
[00:06:00]  Imus, I guess, for some reason, like I said, again, he came off as very sincere, which I think he was,  and decided, hey, let me go on Reverend Al's show.  I'll apologize.  It'll be the audience that I want to see me apologize.  You know, he wants to get his word out to as many black people as possible that are angry with him.  And doing it on Reverend Al's show, I guess you figured it would be a good idea.  Well, he's taking a page from Michael Richards' book.  Michael Richards went on Jesse Jackson's radio show. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And this is what's said.  The media is making this into a Michael Richards incident.  Michael Richards, you know, there was a lot of hate when he's screaming the N-word.  At those patrons, at the comedy club.  And to just lump this into the same type of media frenzy is insane.  Yeah, it really is.  It was a throwaway comment on a comedy show.  Don Imus would consider himself a comedian.  Yeah.  His radio show, a comedy show.  And who knew the new N-word would be nappy?  Who knew that would be the new N-word that people are going to be afraid to say? 
[00:07:00]  That memos are going to be passed around radio and television stations.  That this is another word that is off limits.  Nappy.  Remember, Opie, how you used to say when you were sleepy?  What did you used to say?  That you have to go home and take a...  Nappy.  Nappy.  No, now you've got to say, I've got to go home and go to sleep.  Because a nappy is out of the question now.  Yeah, Imus was rolling off the cuff.  He got caught up in that moment.  Said that.  Anyone with brain knows. 
[00:07:30]  You can just tell by how he said it.  There was no hate involved.  People got upset about it.  He apologized.  End of story.  The guy wasn't, you know, he wasn't telling people that let's gather weapons for the race war.  You know?  The guy blurted out a comment in a moment that he thought was comedy.  It upset people.  He apologized.  And that should have been the end of it.  Why did Reverend Al have him on his show when he knew damn well that he wasn't going to listen to his apology or listen to anything Mr. Imus had to say? 
[00:08:00]  He was showboating.  Like Opie said before, at one point he talks about the Rutgers girls, the basketball team, and says that he had insulted all of them.  And then out of nowhere, this young black woman comes up.  He goes, where is she?  Reverend Al goes.  And then instructs a young black woman to come up and face Imus.  So she's glaring down at Imus. 
[00:08:30]  And he goes, this is my daughter.  It's Reverend Al's daughter, Dominique.  I got the clip if you want.  I'll set it up with the clip.  This is from Reverend Al Sharpton's radio show.  No one even knew he had a radio show until yesterday.  We're all trying to get the live feed to be informed.  Just in the nick of time, I was going to have to go to podcast.  No kidding.  This is from his show yesterday with Mr. Imus.  How reads?  This is not about whether you're a good man. 
[00:09:00]  This is about setting a precedent that allows racist language to be used in mainstream, federally regulated television and radio.  All right.  I want to comment right there.  Setting a precedent racially.  You know something?  First of all, Reverend Al, you're allowed to do that.  There is no rule in place that says you can't say things that will racially charge up people.  It's freedom of speech, dummy. 
[00:09:30]  And if you're now doing a radio show, maybe you should understand what the rules and regulations are.  And how about...  And how about it's a double-edged sword?  Because like I said, I used to listen to M-Hotep Gary Bird on W-L-I-B here in New York and hear some of the most racist hate speech against white people I've ever heard in my life.  And I'm not kidding.  And Reverend Al Sharpton's old enough.  He heard the same damn broadcast. 
[00:10:00]  He used to be a guest on his show.  There you go.  The guy, this Gary Bird would get on and he'd have guests come on that would just preach of hatred of white people, hatred of the white race, talking about how science has proven that melanin in the skin also affects the brain and makes it superior to people without melanin in their skin.  Dude, this is the crap I used to listen to. 
[00:10:30]  And it would outrage me.  Did I run to the media?  No.  I was busy working.  Did I do...  Did I try to get the press involved in this?  No.  It would outrage me.  But one thing I recognized, they had the freedom and right to say that and to piss me off.  It's a freedom of speech.  That's what you have in this country.  And that's why people should be really outraged today.  Completely.  Black, white, purple, green.  Who gives a crap?  You should be outraged.  This is such a freedom of speech thing. 
[00:11:00]  I bet people better wake up and understand that.  If they are practicing mob tactics, believe me, it's a minority of black people too.  Most of the black people don't care about this.  It's the ones that want the press, that have a history.  Him, Jesse Jackson.  They have a history of whoring.  Whoring to the press.  That's what they do.  That's been their job over the years. 
[00:11:30]  You tell me one goddamn thing that Reverend Al Sharpton's done but whore himself out for the press.  An exploitive jackass that finds any situation that's racially charged and jumps in the middle of it.  That's what Reverend Al does.  That's his goddamn job.  And it's disgusting that he comes out against free speech and says a line like that, like he just said in that clip we played, which is completely against the Constitution and freedom of speech. 
[00:12:00]  And like I said, it's a double-edged sword, jackass.  When I would listen to those shows, it was outrageous.  People just saying that we are in a war.  Black people getting on the air saying we are in a war with white people right now.  We are in a war.  They would take these militant stance.  Remember Sister Soldier?  Remember her years ago?  Sure, yeah.  She came on Gary Bird's show.  M-O-T-E-P, Gary Bird, L-I-B.  And she would come on and it was nothing but hate speech. 
[00:12:30]  Just a tirade of hate speech.  And what did whitey do about it?  What did stupid let's sit here on our ass and do nothing whitey do about it?  Went to college.  Right.  It's outrageous that white people are completely castrated in these situations.  We don't do anything.  We hear it.  We're outraged by it.  But, you know, we just kind of go, eh.  And then situations like this happen and you sit back and let me explain to anybody that, like Reverend Al or Jesse Jackson or anybody of that mindset that's listening. 
[00:13:00]  This does nothing for race relations but to set it back years because white people don't look at this and go, yeah, that's great.  I like how you're using terrorist tactics and threats against people's livelihood to get your point across for an issue that is meaningless. 
[00:13:30]  It's words.  It's the context of the words.  It's meaningless.  And it makes white people look and go, Jesus Christ, can't you focus on something more serious like black on black prime, which is wiping out your young men population?  The fact that your young men are in prison.  Or rap music that sings about nappy-headed hoes.  Nappy-headed hoes constantly.  And Reverend Al goes, well, you know, I spoke out against that.  Well, Reverend Al, why don't you get rap people on your station and treat them like you did Imus yesterday? 
[00:14:00]  Let me see your balls when it comes to getting a couple of hardcore rap guys on your station.  Let's see how brave you are.  Bring your daughter out when that's happening and ask them to sing a few of their song lyrics to her.  You know what?  They will.  And you know what you'll do?  Back down.  Because you're a chicken crap ass.  The guy has done nothing.  I have been infuriated all night long.  I listened to the entire broadcast of Imus on his show and was, first of all, embarrassed for Imus. 
[00:14:30]  I felt bad for the guy.  He was in a no-win situation sitting there.  Reverend Al was an opportunistic jackass like he always is.  And it was infuriating to watch.  Infuriating.  Imus could do nothing right.  And then when he said, what was his quote about you people?  He said, I can't get anywhere.  I can't get any place with you people.  I can't get any place with you people.  And Reverend Al jumped on it.  He goes, what do you mean by you people?  And Imus should have said, the black people that are against me. 
[00:15:00]  Who do you think we're talking about here?  He thinks you people means the end.  Right.  The ends.  Saying you people is equal to using the N word.  It's usually you say, I can't get anywhere with you people.  It means people that are against you or have something against you.  You people, the collective of the black people that are trying to crucify me.  Right.  That's what he should have said.  Well, the papers have made a big deal out of the you people comments.  Jesus Christ.  I mean.  It's just ridiculous. 
[00:15:30]  This is being blown out of proportion.  And now I think Imus is going on the Today Show with Reverend Al again.  And stop giving this guy credibility.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Here's the rest of the audio.  Tawana Brawley case.  Tawana Brawley case.  Please, please just go to the Internet.  Look it up.  Read everything that Reverend Al did with the Tawana Brawley case.  And Mason and Maddox, those two jerk-off attorneys that got disbarred because of that.  Read what they did to innocent people. 
[00:16:00]  Pagonis.  Stim Pagonis, yeah.  Stim Pagonis.  Read what they did to this guy.  And see what type of opportunistic, race-baiting, jerk-off Reverend Al Sharpton is.  I don't fault Sharpton because Sharpton is doing –  Oh, Jimmy, stop it.  I fault because he's just doing what he can do.  I fault the corporate douchebags that constantly buckle to the pressure.  If he didn't get what he wanted, he wouldn't do it.  He's just doing what he can.  He's just grabbing what he can.  Why would they suspect that? 
[00:16:30]  Because the media loves it.  It's a show.  This is a show for them.  So they suck it up.  They look at Reverend Al and Imus.  It's black against white.  The media loves it.  They love it.  I mean the suspension and the fact that – you know, as Blasher's came, you've got to apologize.  Yeah.  MSNBC and CBS are being pussies for suspending Don Imus.  They are, but they're also just trying to save his radio show because here's the problem.  If the advertisers start boycotting, then Don Imus is worth nothing. 
[00:17:00]  How many times have I said – do you know how many people –  I'm just saying that's their thinking in this whole thing, whether it's right or wrong.  I know, but let me give you some reality here, CBS Corporate and MSNBC.  You listening?  The boycott garbage is just that garbage.  It's not going to affect your bottom line, which I know is the most important thing.  Do you know how many people showed up at Jesse Jackson's protest in Chicago yesterday?  It had to be thousands.  I think even when he just announces he's going to go to a restaurant, thousands show up, right? 
[00:17:30]  Thousands?  A little short of that.  It was 50 people.  50 people.  50 people showed up.  When Jesse Jackson shows up somewhere, more than 50 people should show up just because Jesse Jackson's there.  He's a celebrity.  He showed up for a cause, and 50 people showed up.  Do you think 50 people are going to affect your bottom line?  Do you think people have the energy and time to waste on a boycott?  You're looking at such a small number of people that are making a huge noise about this. 
[00:18:00]  It's not going to affect your sponsors.  More would have shown up, but they couldn't get out of work.  Yeah.  There you go.  Because it was a last-minute rally he put together.  Here's more of Sharpton and Imus from yesterday.  This is where Sharpton dregs out his daughter because she had everything to do with the Rutgers women's basketball team.  She's showboating.  I didn't know she was a guard on the team.  I had no idea that she went to Rutgers.  He's showboating.  That's right.  She didn't.  She's setting a precedent that allows racist language to be used in mainstream, federally regulated television and radio. 
[00:18:30]  What you said was racist.  You see this young lady here?  Where she is?  You see this young lady?  See, when he said, see this young lady here, I'm like, well, that's kind of interesting.  He actually got one of the Rutgers women's basketball.  No, I know.  Yeah, I know.  But he's being dramatic.  Yeah.  And Imus is looking like, well, I guess I'm going to have to apologize.  This is one of the women I said was a nappy-headed hoe.  And then it has nothing to do with it.  He didn't say, where's my daughter?  Where is she?  Right, right, right.  He goes, where's that lady? 
[00:19:00]  Where, where?  Right, right.  Because he wants to make the big reveal.  Right.  It's all showbiz for this guy.  What he should have done was point at his daughter, and then he should have said, now,  I defended the four guys that attacked Bernard Goetz, one of them who raped a pregnant woman  on a rooftop.  Right.  Afterward.  Maybe he should have mentioned that.  Yeah, yeah.  Mention that.  I think there are more important things to worry about than Don Imus.  Were you playing the game I was playing at home?  I was watching the broadcast going, right about here, I would have been fired.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, please.  That's why Mr. Imus is much better than us, because I'm looking there going, all right,  this is right about the point I personally would have taken it too far and gone.  You know what?  Screw everything.  I ain't taking this crap.  Here's the rest of it.  Yes, sir.  This young lady has graduated Hamda, went to Temple.  She is not a nappy-headed hoe.  She's my daughter.  Who cares?  And when I heard what you said, I've got to defend my daughter.  This is not about whether you're a good man. 
[00:20:00]  It's about how you devalue how my daughter's in the...  How does he bring his daughter into this?  You close-minded F.  You know why?  Imus didn't call every single black woman in America a nappy-headed hoe.  When Imus says, you people, and he goes, what do you mean by that?  Because you're covering a vast majority of black people and lumping them into one category.  What did he just do?  He lumped in his daughter with black women that Imus was talking about.  A number of black women, specific black women. 
[00:20:30]  He wasn't talking about all black women.  But then, when it's handy and convenient for him, he then brings his daughter out and says, well, you were talking about all of us because we're all the same.  One way or the other, people, you can't have it both ways.  Well, Reverend Al can.  Reverend Al absolutely can.  He always has.  And these race-baiting black, and I'm using my finger quotation marks, leaders.  Because black people really have to step up and get leadership that is leadership and not showboating, self-serving, self-centered asses like Reverend Al. 
[00:21:00]  Let's get to this clip because we've got to take a break.  I mean, and to the dope, where's the funny, don't kill your own show for the sake of this jerk, Metcalf in Tampa.  Metcalf, go listen to a two-for-Tuesday radio station.  You don't have a brain for this today.  It's not always about the funny.  It's about what's affecting the world and us personally, the radio industry. 
[00:21:30]  This is all, it's all over the news today, every station.  And you know what?  We're not going to talk about it.  If Reverend Al has his way, this show will be affected drastically.  Another castration.  I've got to defend my daughter.  This is not about whether you're a good man.  It's about how you devalue how my daughters and the daughters of a lot of people listening are going to be looked at in this world.  You have anchormen from news, network news.  You have senators.  You have presidential candidates that come on your show. 
[00:22:00]  Are we now saying it's acceptable in the middle of these kind of candidates and these anchormen for you to sit up and call my daughter a hoe?  That's what we do.  My daughter.  You didn't call your daughter a hoe!  When did he do that?  When did we miss that?  How the hell does he get away with this?  I'm sure he's spoken up right there and go, when did I call your daughter a hoe?  Why would he?  That's the way Sharpton does it.  It's white people who are afraid of him who are the problem.  He's not the problem.  It's white guys in suits who walk in and go, I guess we should feel guilty.  I guess we don't want them upset. 
[00:22:30]  That's who the problem is.  That's who the problem is.  Tawana Brawley case.  Look it up.  Get the Reverend Al.  See what this guy's all about.  Candidates and these anchormen for you to sit up and call my daughter a hoe?  That's what we're talking about here?  I'm sure you're not.  Well, then, you didn't say the answer to that is I'm a good guy.  Why isn't there the same kind of outrage, let me ask you, in the black community, when  rappers and other people in the black community, athletes in the black community, defame and  demean black women?  I am one of them that is outrageous.  I call them more times than I ever did.  And I am absolutely outraged by it. 
[00:23:00]  I attack it.  I disagree with it.  I've had friends of mine that use bad raps on radio that was fine.  And I do not think that there ought to be two standards.  I think you ought to join them.  But what friends of his were fired?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Please.  Let me know.  Yeah.  Let me know.  He had no name.  He had no names there.  Yeah.  You're a bunch of crap.  He's just a showboating, zero credibility, opportunistic jackass. 
[00:23:30]  That's why Rudy would never meet with him.  Giuliani would never meet with him.  Good.  That's the beauty of it.  Because he didn't want to give him any credibility.  All right.  We're fired up today.  Trust me.  Trust me.  We're just beginning.  And we look at all the jocks in New York, and we'll see what they said.  Oh, what a surprise.  Whoopi Goldberg said that Iams' comment pissed her off.  Oh.  Oh, we'll get into that in a little bit.  Yeah.  Maybe Whoopi's got a past that she should address. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Her hair.  We go to break with this.  Hey, watch what you say, Jimmy.  Don't talk about her hair.  It's true.  The boss may walk in and go, he should apologize.  Really?  Shitty.  White guy.  Didn't she make her whole career on a character that was based on a nappy-headed hoe?  I think so.  Isn't that how Whoopi started?  Of course she did.  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  On a one-woman show.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the Reverend Al song.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in a cool club's clan? 
[00:24:30]  Yelling and a-screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's staffing off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace. 
[00:25:00]  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an act just like a buzzy.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bernie Getz and the Brawley case?  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face. 
[00:25:30]  He's speeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming right.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge me. 
[00:26:00]  Not as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  Well, he's your pal.  That's right, Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's a raised, fainting white, hating bag of baloney.  Now, why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[00:26:30]  O&A Uncut and live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  Oh, welcome back.  6.35.  I'm us in the morning program.  Uh, just want to apologize for my apologies. 
[00:27:00]  Stop apologizing.  You apologized enough, Mr. Imer.  Okay, I apologize for that then, too.  I'm, uh, I'm sorry about that.  Stop!  Enough!  No more apologizing.  Okay, I, I'm sorry.  No!  You don't have to say sorry.  Just leave it at that.  Leave it at that.  Don't say anymore.  I'm going to do a, um, a blanket apology for all the apologies I did that you didn't want  me apologizing for.  No.  I'll apologize for, uh, the, uh, apology. 
[00:27:30]  Apology accepted?  No, it's not.  I'm sorry.  Because we don't want you apologizing anymore.  Then I want to apologize.  And you know what we mean by we, don't you, Mr. Imer?  I, I just can't, uh, I can't win with you people.  And by you people, I mean the people I'm apologizing to, and I'm sorry.  Stop with the sorry, please.  That I, uh.  Stop.  Stop.  Okay, I'm.  Stop.  I'm sorry.  Stop.  I apologize.  Stop.  Look, I'm, I'm sorry. 
[00:28:00]  I miss it in the morning program.  By the way, I, uh, not, you know, we have you on the show here.  You know how, like, you go on MSNBC and you goof around and say that Opie could be my son?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  You just stop that.  Oh, you don't want me to, uh, we, uh, we, uh, we took a picture, uh, together.  No, no, no.  And you look like my, uh, my son.  Not anymore.  That bit's over, okay?  It was funny for a while, but it's getting old, and I think we should maybe just move  on from that.  Okay, I'm sorry about the picture. 
[00:28:30]  What did I say about the sorry thing?  All right, I apologize for that.  No apologies, no sorries.  You did it all yesterday.  Stop.  I actually want to apologize that I brought a midget, Mark Chernoff, to, uh, the show yesterday.  So I'm in the corner.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  He's trying to distract the black people.  Yeah, yeah.  He thought it was a leprechaun, brilliant.  Good luck.  Uh, let's go to Grand Rapids. 
[00:29:00]  There's a couple of things I didn't apologize for.  I don't know if you guys caught it, but, um, he's also taking responsibility for slavery,  South Africa, high blood pressure, Katrina, and the watch riots.  Yeah, I want to apologize for all that.  All right, uh, we got to get Patrice's audio from last night's, uh, Hannity and Combs.  Hannity!  And Combs.  Uh, Andy and Grand Rapids, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Uh, we're doing all right.  Andy, what do you got?  Well, I just wanted to say how important your views are to me, man.  I've been listening to you for a while, and, I mean, you guys tell how it is. 
[00:29:30]  I'm glad to hear it from something.  You know, we think that you should be able to say whatever the hell you want on the radio,  especially if you're doing a show based on comedy.  Yeah.  We should not be held to these high standards that they hold, like, network news to.  Yeah, it's a comedy show.  In the end, this is a bunch of dopes on the radio that we don't have responsibilities.  That's why we went into radio.  Just hanging out, having a good time, joking around, and when you do that, 
[00:30:00]  you're going to say things that are inappropriate, that are offensive to certain groups,  or this one or that one, and it's just the way people talk in regular life with their friends, by the way.  No secret there.  But there's a freedom.  There is freedom of speech that, you know, and people say, well, along with it comes consequences.  Well, it's got to work both ways then because, like I said earlier, I've just heard the most awful racism on black talk radio, 
[00:30:30]  worse than I've ever heard.  You know why?  They don't have fear.  There's no fear that there's going to be repercussions like there is with white people doing radio.  When you sit there as a white person doing radio, you're constantly walking on eggshells and having to check yourself,  not just for FCC violations.  You know, we're trained for that.  See, that's easy.  We're trained for FCC violations.  When it comes to offending a race or someone's sexual preference,  the area is so gray and it's so personal that you don't know what you can or can't get away with. 
[00:31:00]  So when you say something off the cuff like I just did and you find yourself in trouble,  you're sitting there going, what the hell happened?  Your head's spinning.  But black talk radio, you can pretty much get away with whatever the hell you want to say as far as white people go.  Now, when you start affecting other minorities, there could be a problem.  When you make a tsunami song, you're going to get your ass thrown out the door,  although I don't think the host did.  No, of course not.  Yeah, she didn't. 
[00:31:30]  So profound.  So profound.  You guys are amazing, man.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, you know, and this is the thing.  This could be our last broadcast.  And I know that sounds really dramatic, but every day we walk into this studio thinking that this could be our last broadcast.  It takes one lousy two seconds of airtime to blow up your entire career.  It's no way to live.  But we live it.  We live it as long as we can.  And eventually they'll come after us for some dopey thing.  And then it'll be up to the corporate people whether we're worth that much to the company or not. 
[00:32:00]  It will happen to us eventually.  Yeah.  It's happened to so many other jocks when they were just trying to entertain their audience.  And they say something that might be stupid.  They didn't mean any.  There was no hate behind it.  Next thing you know, they're showing the door like that because they weren't making enough money for the company.  Imus, they're trying to save him.  He means a lot to this company.  Yeah.  But who knows if they're going to be able to save him in the end.  Who knows?  What did Whoopi say?  Didn't she come out and...  Oh, yeah.  Whoopi... 
[00:32:30]  A comic.  Whoopi's a comedian.  Whoopi and...  What was?  It's very interesting.  David Hinckley did a whole article on, like, New York radio shows and how they handled this yesterday.  And he points out that J.B. and Elvis, heard on our station here in New York, were already making nappy-headed hoe jokes yesterday.  Good.  And J.B. said it's almost impossible to draw strict content lines outside of FCC-prohibited areas like Curson.  You're going 100 miles an hour on radio, he said.  You want to have fun, you're just making observations, how someone looks, how they talk. 
[00:33:00]  Almost anything said in that kind of free-range context, he suggested, will offend somebody.  And that is the truth.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  We're all together on this today.  And then, of course, he adds, what's the big deal?  It's a joke.  Bob Grant famously fired from ABC in 1995 over a comment about the late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said yesterday,  the freedom to say controversial things is essential, but also inevitable leads to verbal missteps. 
[00:33:30]  Everything doesn't come out the way you want, he said.  There were many times when I'd be going home and say to myself, what the hell did I say that for?  God, does he speak the truth.  We think the same thing.  But that's the pace you work at.  That's what people don't take into account.  Yeah, we don't have scripts where we can go over our words and go, oh, well, maybe we should change this.  This is the, that line right there could get us fired today.  This is all off the cuff every single morning.  Howard Stern on Sirius had a, well, why bother? 
[00:34:00]  No one heard what he had to say.  And then Whoopi Goldberg.  We get to Whoopi.  She wasn't laughing yesterday.  No.  What I said, piffed me off, she said.  Well, when you talk like he does, it comes back to bite you in the butt.  How do you explain you're not a racist?  Whoopi.  Whoopi.  Whoopi.  Whoopi.  How do you explain you're not a racist?  Well, maybe you could say that you're a comedy show.  And, um, uh, in the, uh, context of what you were doing, you blurted out, uh, something 
[00:34:30]  that, uh, people found offensive, but it was under the context of comedy, you know, remember  that situation, uh, with, uh, Ted Danson when he, what did he dress in blackface, put  on blackface and, uh, went into some kind of Al Jolson, uh, act and, and, and it drew outrage  from people.  And who came to his defense, Whoopi Goldberg, because she was effing him at the time. 
[00:35:00]  Hey, what kind of double standard crap is that, Whoopi?  Let's get Whoopi on the phone today.  Let's ask her to her face.  How come that wasn't offensive?  Uh, when he was joking, cause she just, she kept saying, oh, he was just joking.  He does that.  Oh, he was joking.  Really?  What's the difference?  Seems pretty similar to me, doesn't it now?  The only guy that's come out in his defense black is a star.  That's the only black guy that's come out in his defense.  Yeah.  Uh, star says Don Imus is a national treasure and people better get over it. 
[00:35:30]  Morning host Amy Goodman and Deepa Fernandez on WBAI both featured segments condemning  Imus' comments.  Ew.  And the Jeff Fox show urged listeners all morning to flood Imus' bosses with complaints.  Stop it.  You're a douche, Jeff Fox.  Do you even understand how to do a morning radio show?  Who is Jeff Fox?  Do you understand they're going to come after you next when you make fun of Asians or Puerto  Puerto Ricans or whoever the hell you make fun of? 
[00:36:00]  Not even make fun of.  You could just be talking about something and get in trouble.  This doesn't even have to be in a joking context.  It could be something you're talking about the news somewhere and you mention something  and get in trouble.  Just watch what you say.  Eggshells.  Tread lightly.  Don't these people understand they come for you next?  This is a freedom of speech thing, not a black and white thing?  What's the problem is people don't have honest relationships with black people.  True.  That's why all these corporate dullards that are yelling, he's terrible. 
[00:36:30]  He should say, he's sorry.  They don't interact with black people on a daily basis.  They don't have real friendships where they tease each other and they have honest exchanges.  Me and Patrice or me and Keith, all we do is argue about race.  Sometimes I'm right, sometimes they're right.  They're honest.  We never pull punches.  So I'm comfortable enough around those guys to be honest.  Other people who don't interact with black people like that, they have no comfort level  whatsoever.  So as soon as a black guy gets upset, they think it's going to turn into do the right  thing and a garbage can is going to get thrown through the window. 
[00:37:00]  They're like, oh my God, oh my God, the animals are mad.  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Instead of just realizing you're wrong, stupid.  Be mad, but you're wrong.  And then there's a guy named Bob Pickett.  He spent the morning.  Listen to what Bob Pickett did.  What did Bob Pickett do?  We're in the business with these asses.  Who's Bob Pickett?  Bob Pickett spent the morning outside MSNBC studios in New Jersey urging workers at MSNBC  to support Imus' dismissal.  What a douche. 
[00:37:30]  Why?  Who's Bob Pickett?  Who is he?  The hell is Bob Pickett?  He took his name literally.  Who is he?  And he started to pick it.  Wait, there's a comma in there.  It was just an order.  Oh, he's a one-man picket line.  What a, what a, what a, what a, what a, oh, I don't know what I could say.  What a goose.  There you go.  We'll say that.  What a goose.  Actually, a G.  You can't say goose anymore.  It's a G.  The goose Americans are very angry.  And then it finishes with us.  On the other end, Opie and Anthony, who have a friendly rapport with Imus, mostly joked 
[00:38:00]  about the case.  God, he listens to a different show, I think.  I think we kind of commented on a lot of what was going on.  Or he might listen to, like, five minutes and then think, that's all we did yesterday.  We got pretty serious yesterday, Mr. Hinkley.  Whatever.  He sees it that way.  Anthony said a black host could have said what Imus did, criticizing what he called a double  standard.  Yep.  There you go.  Huge double standard.  And a lot of black people just say, well, yeah, there's a double standard.  Get over it.  No. 
[00:38:30]  No.  No.  Not when people's livelihood are on the line, not when black leadership, again, using the  term very loosely, is using terror tactics.  They're using mob tactics to threaten people with their livelihood to keep them from expressing  their freedom of speech.  And the statement, nappy-headed hoes, just doesn't have power if you're using nappy in  music, in titles of books. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, there are books out right now.  I believe titles of movies.  We actually read this book on the air because there was kind of a to-do about it a few years  ago.  It was a book that had nappy in the title, I think, nappy-headed girl or something like  that.  And it was about a young black girl who didn't like her hair because it was...  What was the name of that book?  Nappy.  Was it nappy hair?  Yeah, nappy hair.  I believe.  And she was upset about it.  And the whole book was kind of about how they wanted her to feel good about her natural 
[00:39:30]  hair.  And it was called nappy hair.  And of course, it was a black author.  So that was okay.  Now, you know, what's the difference?  Is the word as a whole bad?  Like, I don't understand, is using the word bad, is using it in a certain context bad?  Is it always bad for a white person to say nappy like it is to use the other N-word that  no one can use?  Starting today, this is the new N-word.  I don't know the rules anymore. 
[00:40:00]  Can black people put out a rule book that whitey can get every month that updates what  we can and can't friggin' say anymore?  And I can't accept that they're allowed to say a certain word and we're not.  No, I don't like that at all.  I just don't see it that way in America.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  It's called nappy hair.  And I got a song about Fugees, nappy heads.  We can do this all morning.  It's all over entertainment.  You know what?  Imus doesn't know.  No, Imus probably heard nappy-headed hoe from the black community in a song, reading 
[00:40:30]  it in a book.  Nick, he's not in touch with mainstream America enough to know that he would come up with  this on his own.  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Look at Wycliffe.  The nappy heads are coming out.  Happy to be nappy, another book.  I mean.  Happy to be nappy.  Happy to be nappy.  I need a nappy.  I'm happy to be nappy after the show.  I go home.  I can't wait to nappy.  Oh, I love a good nappy.  Oh, be careful.  David Hinckley's going to think a joke in the morning. 
[00:41:00]  That was just a quick joke, Mr. Hinckley.  I, uh, Sharpton forgave, quote unquote, uh, Jerry Brown, I guess, because politically  he does what Sharpton wants.  And, and Jerry Brown said nigger in some type of context.  It wasn't very vicious, but he said it like, uh, I don't know what context to use, but  like, you know, that's what I am, like comparing like how he's treated.  And, uh, you know, the people that we didn't hear much about, of course, I think Nader did  that.  Um, was it Nader?  Ralph Nader?  Maybe I'm wrong.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  Did that.  And, and yeah, he was forgiven because, uh, Nader is just a, a screaming liberal. 
[00:41:30]  And Sharpton said, well, he's not a racist.  I know he's not a racist.  Yeah.  That's why he didn't make it be.  And I've seen it.  Well, then you're talking context.  Yeah.  Let me get Vicki in.  She's been waiting an hour.  Uh, unbelievable.  The phones were just lit from, uh, from the first minute of today's show.  Uh, Vicki in Michigan, what's up?  Hey, you guys are hot.  Thank you, Vicki.  Thank you, Vicki.  Hey, listen, um, two things.  First of all, nappy-headed hoe is not a unique word to black people.  I know a lot of nappy-headed hoes that definitely are not black.  So it's definitely, it's definitely. 
[00:42:00]  Well, hold on.  What do you, what do you say?  I, I don't understand what you mean.  What, where, what, when do you refer to your white friends as nappy-headed hoes?  Yeah, I've never heard nappy in the white community.  Well, that's just, that's just, that's just, that's just, that's just, that's just, that's  a semantics playing.  Our own, our own Sam is nappy-headed.  Yeah, but he's candy-headed.  He's 5% white.  I don't know, if it's, if it's, if it's a bad, uh, bed-head, bar-head at night, you  know, if it's all manned up in, in the morning, you know, we'll call each other nappy-headed.  I don't think so.  Maybe rat's nest is kind of something we use.  Bed-head.  Bed-head.  White people never say nappy-headed to each other. 
[00:42:30]  I don't jump in there.  That's just, that's just plain semantics.  You can say, look, it doesn't have anything racial.  It does.  It's fine that it doesn't.  Yeah.  So what do you got, Vicki?  No, okay.  Well, anyway, I, anyway, I disagree with you guys.  I think that nappy is not, is not racial.  I know you don't, because you're from the Midwest, man.  All right.  Well, basically, you want to say, it's about time someone says what you're saying, but  I guess that's not what you wanted to really say, but that's what it said on your comments.  That's right.  It's you and your white friends going, you go, girl, and high-fiving.  All right.  What the hell am I saying?  Let's go to New York.  Tim, what's up?  Morning, guys.  Good morning, Tim.  Yeah, the reason I'm calling this morning is because I know you guys have talked about it 
[00:43:00]  multiple times before, about how a lot of Americans are upset with, like, the Patriot  Act and acts like that, where personal rights are being infringed, you know,  opening of mail, listening to phone calls.  But everybody's so quick to denounce that, yet jump on restricting the First Amendment,  the one that this country was founded on, the freedom of speech.  Just because one person might get upset about it, the rest of the country must suffer and  have to have those basic rights taken away from them, which is the biggest problem I have 
[00:43:30]  with everything, is America itself is being hypocritical right there.  Unpopular speech, and I hate to say it because I'm not a lawyer, but unpopular speech has  to be defended.  That's the bottom line.  He was not inciting people to riot.  It's not like he yelled, Jiggaboo, in a crowded movie house.  He just said something that was a little unpopular.  And there was not even a touch of hate when he said it.  And even if there was, that's not...  Exactly.  We said that earlier.  You know, you should be able to say whatever the hell you want in America on the radio, 
[00:44:00]  and Tom will run down the hall, no, no, whatever.  Stay in your office today, please.  Of course.  All right, Tim.  Thank you so much.  Have a good night.  Have a good day, boys.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll continue.  So, Imus on Reverend Al's show yesterday said, you people.  So, we got that.  Yeah.  And we also got Imus trying to explain that on his show this morning.  It's all about Mr. Al's today.  We completely, completely support him.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's 7.03, Imus in the morning program.  For people that wanted to get up at 7 on the nose, I'm sorry.  I woke up late.  What did I tell you about the sorry thing, Mr. Imus?  I just want to apologize to anybody that wanted to get up at 7.  You did all that yesterday.  I got a little late.  No apologies, no sorries today. 
[00:45:00]  You got a lot of people listening to you today.  Yeah.  Just do your show.  Raise the money for the kids.  All right?  That's what I want to do.  Yeah, I'm a good person.  But I'm sorry if I'm too good.  No more sorry.  Like sometimes I'm too good and I want to apologize for that.  Take...  You know what?  You're not allowed to say nappy anymore.  Also, you're not...  Hey, hey, hey, wait.  Also, you're not allowed to say... 
[00:45:30]  Ixnay, Ixnay, Ixnay on the appy-nay.  All right, listen.  All right.  Listen, it's pretty obvious.  You're not allowed to...  O-nay, appy-nay, N-E-K or may.  Listen.  O-yay, A-k.  Listen to your pal.  You're getting me in trouble.  By the way, remember, I'm not your son.  Yeah, I apologize.  We have no...  Stop with the apology.  I'm sorry.  We have no connection.  Okay, listen to me.  You're not allowed to say nappy anymore.  That's pretty obvious.  Yeah.  If you're allowed to continue with your show after your suspension, I'm sure you'll never say nappy again.  I also don't want you to ever say the word apologize or sorry ever again. 
[00:46:00]  You used up that quota yesterday.  And why'd you go on Reverend Al Sharpton's show, by the way?  Why?  Why would you do that?  Nothing good could come out of that.  I was trying to appease...  Those people.  Those people.  By those people, I mean the e-grownays.  Oh, you couldn't commit now, could you, Mr. Iman?  Oh, I...  See, I'm doing pig Latin. 
[00:46:30]  You're a little gun-shy, though.  And I, uh...  You went with e-grownay.  And why didn't you really go for it?  By pig Latin, I don't want to upset the fat Hispanic women.  So, uh, it's a language, not a people.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  I shouldn't laugh.  I should be very contrite.  I'm sorry.  I guess we all have to be careful today, so you went with e-grownay, huh?  Yeah.  Walking on eggshells.  And I apologize to the chickens that laid them. 
[00:47:00]  Sorry.  All right.  I'm not saying that word.  Rock.  Stop underlining it.  He saw it.  As much as you want, baby.  I'm not saying it.  He saw it.  I saw that.  You can highlight it.  You can put stars all around it.  I don't think I need glasses.  I can't see under this cowboy hat.  You can put it in quotations.  You can get a neon sign.  Trust me.  Mr. Ives is not saying that today.  I'm not stupid yet, idiot. 
[00:47:30]  Jerk.  And if people are coming up with other words that maybe you could use today instead of  sorry, or I apologize, like, I'm remorseful.  Very remorseful.  I'm regretful.  Regretful.  Good.  Good.  Well, I just want to put one dope on the air today.  I just want to say I was just rapping.  Yeah.  And I got into the conversation.  I was just rapping.  Yeah.  You know, being down with it and cool and groovy.  They haven't used groovy in a long time. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, sorry.  I want to apologize to the hippie Americans for misusing their terminology.  All right.  Let's say hi to a dope named Bill from Jersey.  What's up, Bill?  Bill.  Welcome aboard, Bill.  Hi, Bill.  What's up, Bill?  Let's hear your point of view today.  What's going on, guys?  What's up, Bill?  Love you.  Love the show.  I just want...  Here's the thing.  A couple of comments.  I wish you would just stop talking about it.  Okay.  We're not going...  That ain't happening.  All right.  This affects everybody that does a radio show, and if you're too stupid to realize that, 
[00:48:30]  then you, too, should go find a Two for Tuesday station today.  No, no, no, no.  Listen, guys.  Okay.  It's good.  It's got its place.  You know, but here's what you should...  Actually, Bill, I hear he's suspended for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you just have him on your show?  Oh, because he'll come right on our show.  Are you kidding me?  He's going to go into hiding.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what'll happen.  And then my last comment is stop referring to Al as a leader.  Are you stupid?  See, this is what we have to deal with.  This is why America's doomed. 
[00:49:00]  People don't listen.  Do you think we talked...  Do you think...  Who said Al was a leader?  You guys talk about the leadership.  You talk about black leadership.  Okay, hold on, hold on.  Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, did you hear me say it's the black?  And then I said...  And I'm using my fingers as making the quotation marks.  I said, leadership.  Didn't you catch the sarcasm that I was using?  Because I never consider them leaders.  Did you hear that?  Yes, I understand.  Open your goddamn ears, you stupid son of a bitch. 
[00:49:30]  Camo.  Camo.  Ugh.  He did use the air quote.  You're an idiot.  You're an idiot.  You're a jackass.  Bill, go away.  This show isn't for you today.  This is some heavy lifting today.  You need to do some light weights.  Yeah, get something light.  Go to Light FM and listen to La La La music.  You need some Celine Dion today.  You don't need this.  This is too heavy for you.  Holy God.  Holy mother of God.  And by the way, anyone else that wants to call, I'm going to make it perfectly clear.  We are talking about this all the way to 855 today. 
[00:50:00]  So you don't like it?  Lump it.  Maybe tomorrow we'll back off a little bit, but this is kind of important to us.  I'm sorry, but it is.  And it has many facets to it that you can call in with and enjoy.  Because I'll tell you what's going to happen.  We'll fast forward about a month, maybe a month and a half.  I'm just predicting.  All of a sudden, we're going to get the call from the lawyers from this company, and they're  going to have some new little rules that they're going to say are subtle.  Yeah, subtle little things that we're not allowed to say anymore to do. 
[00:50:30]  And then when the Asians and everyone else realize they could get somewhere with this  crap, then they're going to throw their horse crap into the mix.  And then more phone calls and letters are going to come from the lawyers.  And there's going to be some more little subtle changes.  This politically correct garbage is killing entertainment.  Has been going on for years.  And it's all just little subtle changes.  But you know what?  It's starting to add up.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  That's why these black radio hosts are a bunch of dopes out there for not seeing the big  picture.  Oh, it'll be a long time before they get in trouble for things.  Well, this is what I say today.  This is what I say today.  White people's heads are on the chopping block right now.  White people's heads.  If you're a black radio host, you can talk about the white race in any way you want.  You can accuse the white race of wanting to kill black people. 
[00:51:30]  I heard that yesterday.  It was nice.  I was going through a bunch of little websites and speeches and things like that with impunity.  You could just say this as a blanket statement that all white people dislike us.  That's what I heard yesterday also, that white people dislike black people.  Well, that's a nice statement to just throw out, a blanket statement.  Anthony and I were talking last night, and I don't think the pests are getting it completely  yet.  Starting today, it's a call to arms to all the O&A pests. 
[00:52:00]  Yep.  We want you to start listening to black radio shows.  Yeah.  In your city.  Hey, we want you to send in them being racist, them saying things about Whitey, them saying  things about Asians or whatever group.  It's not, I don't even care about the white black thing as much, but I want examples of  them getting away with murder on a regular basis.  Yeah.  I want the pests.  It's a call to arms to start taping these shows and send them to send them to us. 
[00:52:30]  And we'll play the examples on the air to show you that it is completely a double standard.  I'm not kidding.  Starting today.  I know the pests love doing things for this show.  This one is very important.  Extremely important.  Monitor black talk shows.  Music shows, too.  In between songs when they start talking.  And pick out examples.  Believe me, you won't have a problem.  The examples I saw on the message boards were good, but we're talking about radio in general  today. 
[00:53:00]  I mean, as black activists, they could get away with murder.  They could say, kill Whitey all they want on TV, and there's no responsibility.  But supposedly, there's some kind of responsibility when you do a radio show that's based on comedy,  and that's what I really want to focus on.  Yeah.  So, yesterday on Reverend Al's show, Imus said this, and then we got Imus' response from  his show this morning.  The you people comment.  Yeah.  And, of course, that was dragged in like, what do you mean by you people? 
[00:53:30]  You people's been used by everybody.  I meant the letter U.  I meant Ukrainians.  You people.  In case you missed it yesterday.  As they come to play in the final championship, do you know how much strength that has to  take?  Yes, ma'am.  And then somebody come and spray something in two minutes and tears them down.  I know that.  Them specifically.  And it wasn't just about them, sir.  It was about women in general all over this country.  No, it wasn't.  It's appalling that you don't understand that.  No, I do understand it. 
[00:54:00]  How do you assume that I don't understand it?  Of course I understand it.  Well.  But, I mean, you know, it's like the old country song.  And God may forgive you, but I won't.  Jesus may love you, but I don't.  No, no.  We are forgiving you.  So, I can't get any place with you people.  No, no, no.  But I can get someplace with Jesus.  Who is you people, Mr.  You?  And this woman I'm talking to.  No, no, no.  I'm Congresswoman Keo.  Yes, Congresswoman Keo Patrick.  You know what?  He could call you a couple different things.  That is okay.  They jumped on him.  Well, he meant black people.  And he should have just said, I mean black people. 
[00:54:30]  I mean black people.  Yes.  Because I can't get anywhere.  He means black people that disagree.  If they want to make a blanket statement that Imus was talking about all women.  That woman just said it.  You're talking about all women when you said not beheaded hoes.  Which is a lie.  He was talking about members of a basketball team.  If they want to do that, then what's the problem if Imus says you people.  And is using that as a blanket statement of all black people that are calling for his firing. 
[00:55:00]  What's so bad about you people?  It has this negative.  But that's who he was talking about.  It's not like, you know, God damn.  Let me tell you something about you people.  It wasn't made out of hatred or, you know, some type of racist thing talking about how you people do this all the time or that.  It wasn't the context, idiots.  Look at the context.  Because what he's doing is he's trying to do the right thing. 
[00:55:30]  But it kind of comes off as groveling a bit.  And people are picking out things that they're mad about with other people on you.  It's like the guy who comes home and beats his wife because he's pissed off at his boss.  That's what they're doing.  They know what Imus said isn't that bad.  And they know he's sorry for it.  But they're yelling at 50 other people through Imus.  And that's why he's going to sit there and take it.  And look, he's taking it again today.  There he is on the Today Show with Reverend Al Sharpton and Imus.  I'm talking about it loud.  Why are you giving this guy more credibility?  And we tried to get the NAACP on the phone.  Oh, we called everybody. 
[00:56:00]  We don't hide on this radio show.  Nobody would come on the phone.  And they're all a bunch of cowards.  Nobody would come on the phone.  The NAACP doesn't want to talk to anybody if they're not a bunch of groveling, apologetic white people.  That's who they want to talk to.  Hey, give him more credibility.  Oh, get that audio.  And then, of course, Matt Lauer, the pussy that he is, he's not going to ask the hard questions.  The questions you should be asking Reverend Al as he sits right in front of you.  That's right.  Like, how did you lose all that weight?  He looks good.  Here we go.  You want to hear the rest of the you people thing? 
[00:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  I was just saying, like, Reverend Al could threaten people with their jobs and their livelihood.  But no one can threaten him with his job or livelihood because no one knows what the hell he does.  What is his job?  How do you get that gig as an activist?  How does it pay?  Who pays him?  His job is a professional nudge.  He's a nudge.  Uh-oh.  Is that a word?  It's a new N word.  The new N word.  Nudge.  We've got to just stay away from the letter N today. 
[00:57:00]  Apologize, Opie.  I don't apologize.  Uh, apologize.  I don't apologize.  You best apologize.  I don't apologize.  Look, I'll apologize for my son, Opie, for using the N word.  When I told you earlier, I have no connection with you.  Nudge.  No relationship to you, Mr. Imus.  It was cute for a while, but enough of that.  All right, here's the rest of the thing that went down on Reverend Al last night or afternoon, whatever.  I can't get any place with you people, but I can get someplace with Jesus.  Who is you people, Mr. Imus?  You and this woman I'm talking to. 
[00:57:30]  No, no, no.  I'm Congresswoman Keir.  That's Congresswoman Keir.  Oh, don't try to hang out on me.  Thank you, I'm a star.  What's that?  What do you say?  What do you mean by you people?  You know what I meant.  I'm by you two people.  Like I would say you two people.  There were a whole lot of people.  That's not even fair.  I tell you what, I won't let you talk to some.  You said you were going to be fair.  Keep your word.  I'm being very fair.  Well, keep your word.  I'm being very fair.  I'm saying to you, I asked you, what did you mean by you two women?  I'm in charge here.  Yeah, but you know what I meant.  I asked the question. 
[00:58:00]  You know what I meant.  No, I did not know what you mean.  I'm talking to a man that called people nappy holes and I know what you meant.  Well, I would take a break.  We'll be right back.  Don't guess.  Try to be civil now.  Try to be civil now.  This is everywhere.  Let's just jive.  You're a jive turkey.  That's the way I'm just talking.  I'm a hep cat.  What the hell is Imus doing?  Jive?  He's doing like terms.  Sounds like he stepped out of a Beretta episode.  I was going to say, he's doing terms from like 1974. 
[00:58:30]  You know, you and Huggy Bear sitting over there.  He's turned 1973.  I said firework.  Oh, sorry.  This is everywhere.  It's on every TV.  So, Imus on a show this morning.  He just gave up his radio show, by the way.  Now he's just doing interviews on TV.  Yeah.  He had this to say about the you people comment.  This is about a half hour ago.  Anything else?  I appeared with Reverend Sharpton.  Well, I kind of like Reverend Sharpton.  A lot of people think he's sandbagged me.  He didn't sandbagged me.  But I appeared with Reverend Sharpton yesterday for a couple of hours. 
[00:59:00]  And I thought, other than trying to lay this you people thing on me, which he knows was jive.  And I told him not.  I blew up and off the air at him and told him not to do that because that was just bogus.  Because he knew what I meant, of course.  The same of what I'd say to Lou and Bernard and the children are telling me they want me dead.  Right.  But anyway, I thought he was fair.  I thought he was more than fair.  I've listened to a lot of them.  Yeah. 
[00:59:30]  He has a right to demand that I be fired.  The suspension may not be enough for him, but, you know.  It'll be enough for him.  And I obviously think he knows that.  Once they say a two-week suspension, you can finish the league, I think he's going to be okay.  Well, that's how ours started.  So, I don't know, twice they started with a suspension.  It always starts with a suspension.  And then they kind of see what's going on around you to see if that's going to calm everybody down.  They put the feelers out.  By the way, I don't know if this is true or not, but it was just released that Cal Ripken has blown off his appearance on Mr. Imus' show today. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, really?  Really?  Why?  I don't know if that's true yet.  We'll find out, though.  Why?  Are you worried about his image?  You swung a stick and a ball, stupid.  He won't do our show, either.  Who cares?  Enough with him.  Let him rent dances with wolves.  Oops.  Yeah.  I think that might have been what keeps him off of our show, too, these days.  The whole thing with Ripken's wife allegedly having sexual custody years ago, which is apparently a rumor.  We asked him about it, but not in some scumbag accusatory way, but to get it out of the way, just let him say no and get it done with. 
[01:00:30]  We asked him, like, is this not true?  And he said, yeah, it's not true.  And that was it.  You should have seen how that happened, though.  Like, I was reading Instant Feedback.  Opie knew about the story, the rumor.  Me, too.  Jimmy knew about it.  Coward.  It seems everyone in the room knew about it.  I didn't know about this.  I swear, I didn't know that there was allegedly this affair between Kevin Costner and Cal Ripken Jr.'s wife.  So somebody put it up on Instant Feedback, and I said, hey, Cal, what's this about Kevin Costner? 
[01:01:00]  And the looks Opie and Jimmy gave me, they, like, looked at me, their eyes opened real wide, like, oh, my God, you didn't just ask him that.  And he ran through it, though.  He answered it.  No, my eyes got really wide.  I came.  Was that it?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Okay, Al.  First one of the day.  Oh, yeah, Al. 
[01:01:30]  I was so excited that someone joined my world for today.  I was like, yeah.  It was out of complete ignorance.  I had no clue.  I didn't know what he was going to say.  I thought he was going to say, oh, yeah, he wanted me to star in Waterworld or something.  I don't know.  It was presented honestly, and he answered it.  Nobody called him.  It said that's a lie.  He was allowed to say it.  I would love to have that.  There was a rumor going around about me.  Like, I would love to be able to just clear it up and move on.  Yeah.  That's what he did.  But now we don't get him on the air anymore.  All right.  Baseball people are –  Jocks, baseball and football people are dull. 
[01:02:00]  He won't come on the show anymore.  Who's the other one from XM that won't come on?  The other dibble?  Yeah.  What's up with these people?  And now they canceled Imus' appearance.  Why?  All right.  You don't mind playing with people who are sticking needles in their hineys.  The steroids is another lovely thing.  Oh, the steroids.  Oh, you meant something else.  Hey, I got to interrupt.  Guys, guys, you have to be listening to the Today Show interviews.  It's just about over.  We'll get the audio, hopefully.  Imus is giving Sharpton a piece of his mind, and now they're arguing Imus has had enough  from Al Sharpton. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, good.  So we'll hopefully get an update in a little while.  Good.  Go on the attack, I-man.  Baseball star Cal Ripken Jr., who was to appear on Imus' show later this week to promote  a book, has canceled his appearance according to the Washington Times.  Well, good for you, Cal.  Why promote the book on a show that everyone in America is listening to, you jackass?  Oh, what a dope.  What are you going to do, send out a MySpace blast?  Stupid ass.  Why don't people hide?  Why don't you go on the show and say you don't agree with what happened? 
[01:03:00]  Well, why don't you say I'm sorry for your trouble and tie it in with your book and say  I addressed this in Chapter 8.  God almighty, why don't you be smart, Cal?  Cal?  Cal?  Come on, Cal.  Go on the show, Cal.  Arizona Republican.  I'll give you asthma.  Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, whose presidential candidate has been backed by  Imus on the air, said he would still appear on Imus' program.  He has apologized, McCain said.  He said that he's deeply sorry.  I'm a great believer in redemption.  Waddle doodle.  Whether he needs to do more in order to satisfy the concerns of people like the members of 
[01:03:30]  that team, that's something that's between him and them.  But I have made many mistakes in my life, and I have apologized, and most people have  accepted that apology.  Sometimes an apology should be enough.  Steve from Bayshore is saying, ironically, though, Joel Rifkin is still willing to do the  show.  That's cool.  All right, listen.  Rifkin, whatever, Steve.  Yeah, whatever.  Rifkin, Rifkin.  Anything with a fk.  So is Rifki from Midnight Express.  That's Midnight Express.  We'll be there.  He'll bring his lousy tea.  Hey, we got, what do we got? 
[01:04:00]  I'm trying to organize here.  No, okay.  We got O'Reilly's take.  Where's, CNN did a pretty good piece on this whole thing last night.  Do we have that?  Yeah, Paul's on.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah, Paul's on, and we got Patrice on Hennig and Combs.  We got lots to do.  We're going to run out of time, unfortunately.  And when we get back, we got audio.  Members of the basketball team high-fived when told of Imus' suspension.  Well, I don't blame them.  He did trash them.  It was them that he trashed them. 
[01:04:30]  I think they had to be told why it was bad.  I think that, honestly, I think they probably saw it and went, what a dope.  What an old white dope.  And didn't think much of it, but then someone had to tell them how serious it was, I guess.  Yeah.  I really don't think they were outraged.  That's my personal opinion.  Oh, I'm sorry.  But then they got a little huddle, a little basketball huddle, and then it was explained  to them with a chalkboard and some chalk.  They diagrammed why it was a bad thing that happened to them. 
[01:05:00]  Are we going to break before we go?  Okay, just to ask one thing?  Thursday morning, I'll have to give out the email address Thursday morning.  I'm shooting a one-hour HBO special June 2nd in Washington, D.C.  Nice.  Free tickets.  HBO, they do not sell tickets.  It's free.  Thursday morning, I'll give out the email address to get your tickets, but I would suggest getting  them fast because it will probably go quick.  Oh, they will.  It's going to go like that.  This Thursday morning, like that.  It's all very kind of last minute. 
[01:05:30]  And tickets just about sold out for our Vegas O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Ticketmaster.com.  Yeah, there's only a couple hundred tickets left.  All the info is on our website, but we've got eight or nine comedians.  We're doing it this Saturday.  I have to join at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  Very excited.  And then we're going to have a press conference to announce the rest of the dates.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  It's time to get the gay out with the sounds of a petite white girl getting mauled and 
[01:06:00]  devoured by two brothers, just like lions eating a gazelle.  Today's boner is brought to you by Justin Slayer, Black Pipe Slayer's Force.  That's it for today's boner.  And if you like boners, check out Pornotube.com.  It's 7.33. 
[01:06:30]  I'm in the morning program.  It's trying to figure out what to do.  What did you say?  No, I said figure.  Trying to figure out what to do.  They're listening very closely, Mr. Ives.  Yeah, apparently so.  I want to apologize for that.  All ears are on this program today.  A little indiscretion.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Gotta be very careful.  I'm watching!  Shut up, Al.  Of course you are.  You have nothing better to do.  That all sharpens quite a...  Whoa, what?  I got a beep now.  I can say whatever the hell I want.  I say, f*** those.  Iman's got some balls back today.  That's right, Barber.  That's right, baby.  Iman's got his balls back and... 
[01:07:30]  All those f*** can take a flying f***  if I had my way.  I want to apologize to all the f*** out there  that were upset with what I said.  Those f*** headed f***.  Said it again, I don't care.  You're safe.  You're protected by the beef for now,  but I'm sure they'll take that away from us too,  eventually.  Bunch of f*** headed f***.  It's not quicker to just say f*** us, though. 
[01:08:00]  All right, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Barber!  Quicker and a lot more fun.  Just want to make it perfectly clear,  if you're just tuning in,  we completely support Mr. Imus.  And this instant feedback came in from Pat  in Saratoga, New York.  Very interesting instant feedback.  Hey, guys, been a fan for a while now.  I just tuned in this morning.  Have you considered how you guys might react  if Stern had done the same thing?  I'd like to think you'd be able to take the same position.  Love you, love your show.  And I got to tell you, Pat, 
[01:08:30]  absolutely we would have the same position.  This is very, very important to everyone  that does a radio show like ours.  Absolutely we would take the same position.  As much as we hate that douche,  we would certainly take the position  that we're taking today.  By the way, our staff behind the scenes,  they're looking up Napa in entertainment.  Because Imus brought up that point,  like why don't you go after some of the stuff  that's going on in black entertainment  if you really want to get something done.  And this is more fun than anything, I guess. 
[01:09:00]  Under children's books,  we have found the book Nappy Hair,  Nappy, and Happy to be Nappy.  All children's books.  Happy to be Nappy, baby.  Yeah, we got to get that into a promo.  We're happy to be Nappy.  And just the other books,  Nappy is Good,  Sculptured Nails,  and Nappy Hair.  Don't worry, be Nappy.  Don't worry, be Nappy.  And then it's a...  Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom. 
[01:09:30]  How to Grow Dreadlocks in America  and Still Get Everything You Want.  Eclipsing a Nappy New Millennium.  Short, Black, and Nappy Headed.  And Nicky and the Twins,  The Great Nappy Disaster.  These are actual books out there  that you could get.  Under music so far,  we got Nappy Roots, of course,  and Nappy Brown and the Heart Fixes.  And Nappy websites,  there's napturality.com.  Membership website,  including forums like  nappanings and napsnaps. 
[01:10:00]  Ew.  And then you got nappyhair.com.  They sell Napa t-shirts.  And nappyuniversity.com,  dedicated to educating people  on African heritage.  And then you got companies,  so far one company,  the Nappy Nation,  they're a baby cloth diapers company.  I think the English or Australians  or something call them nappies.  Those are diapers.  Oh, really?  Oh, that's why that one?  Well, look.  Yeah, diaper head's different, though.  Those are Arabs.  Right. 
[01:10:30]  Uh-oh.  I apologize to the Arabs.  Because their nappy head  would be diaper head.  So I'm sorry.  At least we could still hate the Arabs.  Oh, God.  What did I say?  The day we can't do that.  Right.  At least we agree on one thing.  Jesus.  See, that's a joke.  But, you know.  But you never know.  That could be the joke  that'd get us fired.  Yeah.  Well, in Canada,  they have very low tolerance  for any type of racial stuff.  I mean, that's what we're headed.  Like, any type of racial offense,  eventually we'll stop allowing it 
[01:11:00]  on commercial radio.  Mm-hmm.  Sickening.  Hey, Alison Stewart just reported  that W, actually,  that MSNBC will be replacing  Imus in the morning  when he's on suspension  with the Ramon and Frunkish show.  Oh, that should be a hot one.  All right, we got lots of audio  still to do here.  This is Fox 5 News.  They got a little story  on the Rutgers women's basketball team.  Ooh.  After hearing the news  that Mr. Imus was suspended.  Both NBC and CBS  have now suspended Imus 
[01:11:30]  for two weeks.  Some members  of the women's basketball team  gave one another a high five  when I told them  about the suspension.  The players, however,  have been told  not to talk to reporters  on camera.  Why?  But other students  who we spoke to on campus  say the suspension  does not go far enough.  I really think  he should be gone.  I think he should have been fired.  He needs to be made  an example of.  Two weeks is nothing.  New Jersey Governor  John Corzine  met privately  with the women's basketball team  and the president  of the university.  Why?  The president says  the players 
[01:12:00]  as well as their parents  are struggling  with the racial slurs.  No, they're not.  I have today  with members of their families,  mainly their moms  and their dads.  I know that they  are feeling parental versions  of the same anguish  that their daughters are.  Why don't they just  get a hold of themselves  and wear hats?  What a friggin'  fag nation  we've turned into.  We are just  the united  fags of America. 
[01:12:30]  Look, the team  and their parents,  yeah, I understand  why they're annoyed.  I mean, it was them  that he trashed.  Yeah.  But that's the way it is.  You know what also,  and this might be  a stretch,  but he trashed them  as a collective team  of people  he doesn't know.  Of course.  It's very hard  to take things  personally  when you're being  bashed  as a team.  You know,  it wasn't like  he named  the girls by name  and said  this one's  a nappy head  ho. 
[01:13:00]  It just showed  the context  of humor  that it was in  regardless of  if people found it  funny or not.  It wasn't like  he was being  personal with it.  It wasn't a  personal thing.  It's a team.  How many professional  ball teams  get yelled at  by fans  and they call them  something collectively?  It's not this  individual  personal vendetta  you have  unless it's  Jimmy and Jeter.  I know you can't stand.  A nappy headed  mean man. 
[01:13:30]  He was mean to you.  Didn't sign  your autograph.  Exactly.  My perfect  alabaster skin.  And then we got this.  All right.  Now,  Imus has asked  to meet with the parents  and the students  here on the basketball  team.  He would like to  actually sit down  and meet one-on-one  with them.  Not known at this  particular time  if they're going  to do that.  However,  the basketball team  along with some  school officials  are going to be  having a news  conference tomorrow  morning at 11 o'clock.  They are expected  to announce then  whether or not  they're willing  to meet with 
[01:14:00]  Imus.  Oh, man.  Look at this.  They're all doing  press conferences.  The power that they  have.  The power base  that these people  are getting.  What do you mean  by these people?  Black people.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just want to  sit down  and have a rap  session.  Maybe a sit-in  with these people.  I'm trying to  talk like the kids.  He's got to stop  the lingo, man.  Groovy.  You know,  don't jive me,  Reverend Al.  Jive turkey.  Don't jive me.  Jive.  Jesus.  You jive turkey.  You think you're  pulling the wool 
[01:14:30]  over this honky's  eyes?  Right, right.  Honky's outdated.  Honky.  Jive is outdated.  Honky, baby.  Our old nappy  head is hanging  strong, thank God.  That's a gem.  This is a gem.  How do you not use  that in bed?  All right, hey,  we got the patrice.  Come on, Reverend Al.  Slip me some skin.  Come on.  Slip me some skin.  Remember, slip me  some skin.  Hey, come on, Al.  I forgot all about  that one, man.  Give me five.  The **** side.  Ha ha, see?  I flipped my hand  over.  Oh, this is a brand 
[01:15:00]  new TV show out.  If we're talking in  jive.  Yeah.  This is the streets of  San Francisco, it's a  new TV show that's  going to be on, I'm  going to guess, I'm  going to guess NBC.  Don't jive me, you  hood.  I'll teach you a thing  or two.  Give me some skin.  Give me some skin.  Here on the streets  of San Francisco.  God damn, look at  all the ****.  The streets of San  Francisco are slippery. 
[01:15:30]  It's like they're  **** off all over  the place.  Tripped on 20  **** those on the  way here.  Hey, cut me some  slack, Jack.  Okay, who pulled a  rod on the heat?  God damn, when he  started going off on  those words.  Jive.  Don't jive me.  Your Imus is 
[01:16:00]  unbelievable.  I love Imus.  I'm like, dude, it's  beyond unbelievable.  It's shilling how  good that is.  I'll close my eyes.  You'd think it was  the real person.  Oh, shut the **** up.  I got a call from  someone associated with  the Iman show and  they really liked the  Imus that you did  yesterday.  Hey, our own  everything Imus wanted  to say.  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, Mr. Imus does  it in character.  I do it in character.  That's the problem.  He should have done it in  character.  All right.  You got to do these 
[01:16:30]  things in characters and  you can skate by.  In character.  Hey, our own Patrice was  on Hannity.  Hannity!  And Combs.  Last night.  And who?  Combs.  Hannity!  And Combs.  Wait, I'll do Hannity.  You do Combs.  Okay.  Who's more important on  that show?  I was watching Hannity!  And Combs.  And Patrice was on.  Right?  And he mostly talked to  Hannity and didn't really  talk to Combs too much  because why would he? 
[01:17:00]  Because why would he?  Guys, I'm here too.  One of my favorite moments  on TV was looking at  Alan Combs after Hannity  interviewed us for 15  straight minutes and  Alan decided I better say  something.  My name's in the title.  And I actually turned to  him and went, wow, you  talk?  He got so bummed out.  Yeah, he knows Hannity's  the star.  When are they going to  just make it the Hannity  show?  Who cares?  You don't need to be 
[01:17:30]  balanced.  Gotta have that posing  view.  Gives a crap about the  balanced part.  It's fair and balanced.  Not even.  It's not.  It's not.  It's what they say.  It's a wide make  believe it is.  Hey, Patrice.  Yeah, here's Patrice on  Hannity!  Or maybe not.  What the hell  happened now?  Maybe you just got the  Combs audio.  Yeah.  I don't know what's  going on with this.  Let's try it again.  And so, no, seriously,  you don't find anything  wrong with those comments?  It's something wrong with 
[01:18:00]  the comments, but you act  like Don Imus and Kramer are  like malignant spots, but the  whole country...  I didn't even give you my  opinion yet.  White people, I know what  your opinion is, John.  White people?  Yes.  And that whole thing you  read was all like abhorrent.  That's what NBC said?  That's because they were.  Black is saying that.  That's because they were.  That's because those  comments were abhorrent.  And the reason why we have  to defend these young  women is because no one  else will.  The reason why we have to  punish Don Imus is because  if we don't stand up and 
[01:18:30]  speak out, no one else  will.  And comments like this  will continue to be  mainstream.  Man, he's saying all that  on Hannity and Combs last  night like there was a hate  speech thing going on.  Are you kidding me?  Like with a Matthew  Shepard beating.  Right.  Are you nuts?  That's outrageous.  I'm outraged.  What is your daughter who  worked so hard, reached the  championship, and some  dopey radio host says  something like that?  You wouldn't like it?  First of all, have you had  any of those girls on? 
[01:19:00]  I wouldn't invite them  on.  What do you think?  I have a comment.  They've commented at NBC  in New York, and they're  furious.  Of course, that ain't the  real.  Those are their words.  What do you think they  really said when they  heard that?  They didn't go, oh, that's  outrageous.  They went, I know he  didn't call me no nappy  headed hoe.  That's what they said.  I know that cracker didn't  say nappy headed hoe.  That's what they said.  That was an outrage.  Yeah, I agree with  Patrice.  That's about.  Yeah.  That's how real people  talk and react to things  like that.  Not with, oh, well, let me 
[01:19:30]  call a press conference.  Right.  They get people that want  to showboat, and then they  get them together and say,  you know, you should have a  press conference.  That's why they won't let  them talk to the media.  They said they've been  barred from talking to the  media because they don't  want them to talk to the  media because people go, oh,  yeah.  So this is their opinion.  We don't want their opinion.  We want their collective  opinion as gone through a  lawyer or something.  Right.  They'll sue, too.  You watch.  They'll sue for a  motion.  Oh, they'll be a big suit.  Yeah.  Believe.  Believe.  Huge suit.  Are you offended? 
[01:20:00]  I'm not.  First of all, nobody except for  me and the good doctors under  60, and none of you know what  funny is.  Like, a doctor, doctor.  Was that funny?  Was it funny?  What funny to me?  To say nappy-headed hoe is  hilarious.  But in context.  Hold on.  Hold on.  By the way, everyone calm down.  That was a black man that said  it.  He's right.  It is hilarious.  It is hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  I say that's a good observation. 
[01:20:30]  Hilarious.  But in context of a comic, you  should be able to explore any  words you want to say.  He messed up.  Would it be different if a  black person said it?  Of course.  I could say nappy-headed hoe all  day.  But I want to be able to call  white girls straight-headed  hoes any time I feel like  that.  Any time.  Would you?  Of course.  And what you should be  punished for?  Of course not.  Patrice lays it out so perfectly 
[01:21:00]  and so simple.  It's like, yeah.  You know what?  The repercussion to saying  nappy-headed hoe should be  the acceptance by white people  of letting black people say  whatever they want about us.  Which, by the way, they can  and do and have impunity.  The thing that's great about  Patrice is that he's not the  typical black guy.  Nope.  He doesn't need white approval.  He's not looking for your pat on  the head or your empathy.  He doesn't care.  He's brutal. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  And that's why, that's the type  of honest interactions you have  with people.  Like, when you deal with guys  like him, you're not going to  offend black people just having  fun and teasing them.  As long as you're not being  vicious and racist, it's not  going to be a problem.  It's white guys in ties, whose  names I won't mention, who  never interact with guys like  him.  Yeah.  Who are the ones that are  guilt ridden and think, oh, he  should apologize and then go  away and be fired.  And he doesn't have, Patrice  doesn't have an agenda.  No.  Besides getting his face on TV  so someone might give him a  part in a movie or something.  Yeah.  But he doesn't have an agenda  like that guy he was talking. 
[01:22:00]  Who was against him?  The other black guy?  Dr. Hill.  Yeah.  We got more.  He has an agenda.  Yeah.  That guy has an agenda.  He needs to get out there and  say these things to pump his name  up, to show himself as an  activist.  And that's his agenda.  So he has to say these things.  Patrice is being, he's about  the only honest guy you're  going to get talking on this  situation.  He has nothing to lose.  He has something to lose if  he doesn't do it the right  way.  Right.  Dr. Hill has something to  lose on TV if he, you know.  Exactly.  So here's more Dr. Hill. 
[01:22:30]  He says Imus was not  contrite in the you people  comments showed his  character flaws.  And not only does Patrice have  nothing to lose, but if  Patrice does gain something,  he'll wreck it.  Of course.  We all know that.  Oh, Patrice.  So, Dr. Hill, are we  overreacting here?  Is that close?  I mean, look, what he said  was inappropriate, it was  wrong, he's apologized.  At what point do we say,  okay, how about a little  forgiveness?  He's, you know, been  contrite, he went on  Reverend Sharpton's show  today, he realized he's  been wrong.  I didn't find him contrite on  Reverend Sharpton's show.  Do we keep punishing the  guy?  He's crying.  Well, first let me say, I  didn't find him contrite on  Reverend Sharpton's show. 
[01:23:00]  I found him arrogant, I  found him somewhat  belligerent.  What do you want?  You want what?  And his you people  comment to me really, really  underscored the fact that  severe character flaw  directly related to racism.  Enough goddamn racism  accusations at every turn,  at every turn.  You know, Imus goes after  everybody.  He doesn't have a black  agenda.  The Paula Zahn stuff was  hilarious last night. 
[01:23:30]  Hopefully we'll get into  it after the break.  You have phonies.  He had, she had Howard  Kurtz on, and Howard  Kurtz, Howard Kurtz has  been on Imus a lot.  Colonel Kurtz on.  It's been fun.  Damn it, why did my mind  work like mud?  Yeah.  And my mind is mud.  I said, he said Kurtz,  I went Kurtz.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, that is one of  my favorite movies.  What an ass.  Good one.  Howard Kurtz was on  Paul Zahn last night,  and he's been on Imus's 
[01:24:00]  show a bunch.  And Paul Zahn goes,  weren't you once called a  boner nose beanie  wearing Jew boy?  Wow, she said that?  Yeah.  Dude, it is hilarious.  She had to say that with a  serious face last night.  I'll tell you that.  Which shows you how  ridiculous Imus is in the  morning and how ridiculous  we are and everyone else  that does this type of  crap.  We're just going for  dumb jokes.  real fast to wrap up.  How did he? 
[01:24:30]  Patrice describes why  nappy-headed hoes is funny.  And I'm just saying,  I know funny.  And I know if he had said  nappy-headed athletes,  nappy-headed young women,  you go, why is,  no, it's not okay  if he had said that.  We'd be just as a  nappy-headed athlete  would have been,  is he using an adjective  to, I don't get that.  But to say nappy-headed hoe  is so ridiculous,  you know he was  trying to be funny.  You know it.  I mean, he didn't intend 
[01:25:00]  to hurt,  and he realizes he was  wrong.  And it went on.  And the guy said he  still would have been  upset with nappy-headed  athlete.  Well, Patrice would say  yeah, because that was,  that would have been a  real thing.  Like, look at these  nappy-headed athletes  is almost a real insult  because that's not,  that's not what you tie  in with a joke.  That sounds like  something mean,  whereas you nappy-headed  hoes, people know.  An old white guy  saying that is funny too.  You know, playing on  something you've heard  black people say,  and everybody knows that.  A nappy-headed athlete  would show, I think, 
[01:25:30]  real disdain.  I think that's a really  good point, Patrice.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, definitely.  That I just kind of  stole and reiterated  as my own.  We all heard him say it  first.  That's why I said Patrice.  I know, but I kind of  never heard him say it.  Hey, let's see how Leno  handled this last night.  Maybe we get a couple  laughs in today.  Or maybe General Kurtz.  This is Leno last night.  When we get back,  Paul is on.  This stuff was really good.  And our boy Michael  Harrison was on.  Who?  He gave us the sixth place  in Talker's Magazine.  Oh. 
[01:26:00]  He was on discussing it.  He's very good when he  needs to discuss this  stuff on TV.  He's not too wordy.  He gets right to the  point.  And he made some very  interesting points last  night.  I hear that.  But let's see what Leno  did last night as far as  Don Imus goes.  Hey, Kev.  What's up, Jay?  What are East Eggs and  Don Imus having in common?  What's that?  They're both white and in  hot water.  Exactly.  Let's feel dry with Don  Imus.  Or as they're calling him  now, a temporary guest  worker.  You know what happened  with him?  Radio personnel.  Don Imus is in trouble  after making, and there's no  excuse for this, racially 
[01:26:30]  insulting remarks about the  rugby, the women's rugby  basketball team.  Did I say rugby?  Rutgers.  Rutgers University basketball  team.  Exactly.  Exactly.  The Rutgers University  basketball team.  Exactly.  What team, Jay?  The Rutgers University.  Oh, that team.  Yes, in New Jersey.  Well, anyway, today he  went on Al Sharpton's  radio show to beg  forgiveness.  And, of course, no one  believes this.  Al Sharpton has a radio  show?  When did that happen? 
[01:27:00]  Actually, he got  suspended.  I just got suspended.  We just heard this five  minutes ago.  He got suspended for two  weeks.  No word yet which rehab  they're going to.  But he has been  suspended.  And he still doesn't  get it.  Like I said, only two  shots, mighty white of  them.  See, that's the wrong  thing.  That is the wrong  thing.  Exactly.

[01:27:30]  It's the O.V.  and Anthony show.  The O.V.  and Anthony virus.  All right, ladies and  germs, I'm going to be  in Seattle.  My first time ever.  April 27th and 28th at  Giggles 206-526-Joke.  206-526-Joke.  April 27th and 28th.  Giggles in Seattle.  Back with the, uh, I miss 
[01:28:00]  in the morning program on  my, uh, apology tour.  Where are we going to  apologize?  I want to, I want to say  I'm sorry for everything.  Not just that I did.  Just everything. 
[01:28:30]  That, um, which call the,  uh, are you sorry for  being white?  The Hindenburg thing.  Yeah.  My fault.  Yeah.  I, uh, rubbed my feet on  a carpet and touched it.  A little spark.  Boom.  My fault.  I want to apologize.  Titanic.  I give up.  I told him.  Sorry.  Apologize.  Stop.  Apologize.  Stop.  What happened on Titanic?  A 23 skidoo, baby.  Nice set of stems. 
[01:29:00]  Not beheaded dame.  Not beheaded ho is the  only current, current  lingo that is used in a  decade.  I'm no kid, you know.  Yeah.  All right, Mr.  Rimas.  A lot of controversy this  morning with you.  Yeah.  Sorry.  We support you.  You know that.  Sorry you have to  support me.  Although it would be  kind of cool if you did  get fired because I think  they might call us up to  take over.  Opie and Anthony on the  fan?  On MSNBC? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, right.  I apologize to all my  listeners.  If that ever came to us,  those two **** holes.  It's the Opie and Anthony  show.  Whoopi Goldberg wants to  talk to us.  She's going to be on in  about five minutes.  That should be fun.  Hey, Paul is on last  night.  This was some fun stuff.  It was comedy.  Because Paul is on how to  say some ridiculous things  and try to keep a straight  face.  It started with Michael  Harrison, who he's the guy 
[01:30:00]  that does Talker's  Magazine.  He's very, very informed as  far as talk radio goes.  He had this to say last  night on CNN.  I think that everybody in  this scenario is a  hypocrite.  From CBS, rather, to NBC,  to Jesse Jackson, Al  Sharpton, Imus himself for  going around apologizing.  That's not Imus speaking,  honestly.  He's under tremendous  pressure.  The fact is, our entire  culture is awash in this  kind of thing.  And every six months to  eight months, for some  unusual reason, somebody  says something or whatever  that is commonly being 
[01:30:30]  said by so many people in  the media, in comedy, in  movies, on television, on  radio, and they're picked  out, they're held up,  they're burned at the  cross.  We blame them.  We don't blame corporate  America.  We don't blame our tastes.  And the cycle begins  again.  He's wrong.  That was great.  Man, he got it down.  He goes right to it.  And he also talks about  how shows like ours, you  never know.  They're just trying to do  a show, trying to entertain  people as they go to work,  trying to be funny.  You say the wrong thing, 
[01:31:00]  the right person is  listening, and they can  make a big to-do about it.  And the next thing you know,  you're fired from what you  love doing.  All of a sudden, your boss  comes up to you and says,  did you say this today?  And you go, I don't even  remember, but I could have,  I guess.  And then, oh man, we're  in trouble for that.  And you're like, what?  Yeah.  You don't even know.  Yeah.  You never know when it's  going to happen.  Here's Howard Kurtz.  I want to disagree with the  notion this is not I'm  misspeaking honestly.  I mean, you know, beat up  him all you want from  making these horribly  insensitive remarks. 
[01:31:30]  But I've watched him for  several hours today, not  just on his show, but with  two hours getting grilled  by Al Sharpton, who has a  history of saying some  racially inflammatory things  as well.  And this looked like a  chastened man to me.  This looked like a man  who got it.  This looked like a man who  was talking about  changing the tone of his  show.  Now, that's not going to  be enough for some  critics.  I understand that.  But I don't think that he  was putting it on just to  try to make this go.  Because he's surrounded by  the politicians and stuff.  So he knows that this is  not good for his his radio  show.  So I do believe he's he's 
[01:32:00]  going to change.  Yeah, because he would  lose half his people.  Yeah, he's going to tone it  down.  And he enjoys being in that  circle, being able to talk  to.  I mean, God, John Curry, you  know, is on that show all  the time and all these  other politicians and all  these big wigs in the media.  He likes that and he gets  good stuff out of those  people.  So, yeah, I do believe he is  going to change.  He knows he can't go back  to throwing these type of  lines out there and be  under the microscope.  Oh, absolutely.  This is this made me laugh  openly last night when  Paul is on how to say  this. 
[01:32:30]  You said you've been  victimized by him as well,  but you and public  officials have to put up  with it.  You were called by him a  boner nosed, beanie  wearing Jew boy.  This is fun.  Then you get CNN and they  have to say this on CNN.  And the best part was she  said that to Barack Obama.  I'm going to hear that  again.  By him as well, but you and  public officials have to put  up with it.  You were called by him a 
[01:33:00]  boner nosed, beanie  wearing Jew boy.  And going back to what  Patrice said, that's  obviously said to try to be  funny.  Yeah.  It is so ridiculous.  It conjures up an image.  He's trying to be funny.  I mean, it would be great  if the camera then went to  the guy and he was indeed  a boner nosed, beanie  wearing Jew boy.  And by the way, Paul is  on CNN, who has a big  interest in MSNBC taking a  beating on this one.  Yeah.  Stupid Paul is on who  lives in that apartment  building that wanted to  kill the birds.  You bird killing whore. 
[01:33:30]  She said public officials  have to put up with it.  No, they don't, stupid.  They don't have to go on  his show.  I didn't like that little  subtle thing she threw in  there, like Imus is  victimizing all these  people.  Why don't you just be  honest about the agenda  of your stupid network  and covering this like  it's the war?  Yeah, the people that go  on his show understand  what he's all about.  Of course they do.  And there's no hate  behind it.  He beats everybody.  He wouldn't get the  guess he gets if he was  hateful and racist.  Of course.  Did you find that funny?  I didn't find it funny,  but I wasn't terribly  offended because this was 
[01:34:00]  nine years ago.  He was beating up on me  during one of his rants.  Do I seriously think  as a result of saying  that, that he's  prejudiced against Jews,  that he doesn't like  Jewish people?  No, we're talking here  about a guy who does  comedy for a living.  But the problem is,  as in many of those  quotes you just put up  on the screen, his  comedy too often strays  into the offensive.  Yeah.  Paula Zahn gets it.  I'm sure she understands  what funny is as she's  sitting there being  railed by her husband  with her face pressed  out the window.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, 
[01:34:30]  ah, ah.  New man getting  divorced.  Oh, really?  Mm-hmm.  Well, maybe she wants  some, maybe she wants  a man who's  compassionate about  birds.  A little Jimmy  Noitner.  You have been calling  for him to be fired.  Do these two  corporations get any  credit for suspending  him for two weeks?  No.  I think it's a baby  step in the right  direction, but it's  clearly not far enough.  Now, I think to say that his statements were racist, as they've said, then that means they should not allow him to come back.  We hope to meet with all of them and make that case. 
[01:35:00]  Two immediate things is we want to meet with those at CBS and NBC to clearly lay out why he should not be returned after the suspension.  We're in charge of this meeting with CBS.  We want to go to Rutgers University to really stand with these young ladies that have been so disparaged in this.  Yeah, of course, get behind them with the cameras rolling and Reverend Al is going to be – this guy will get behind anything as long as those TV cameras are rolling.  Because it's black and there's cameras. 
[01:35:30]  Right.  And he should be fired based on what?  The apology in this case should be good enough.  It should be good enough.  This is just opportunistic guys like Sharpton grabbing for whatever they can.  And again, that's what he does because he's a contributor of nothing.  Yeah.  The problem is not him.  It is the people who allow him to do it, which is these corporate faggots and these cowards who are afraid of 50 people in Chicago.  When people don't apologize, they're like, see, look, no remorse.  He's not showing remorse. 
[01:36:00]  And then when they do apologize, it's, ah, it's not good enough.  It does – he's not sincere.  There's no winning with you people.  Just like I said.  I beg this company that we work for to hang in there.  Do not fold.  For once, do not fold.  Don't worry so much.  Whoopi Goldberg, everyone.  Oh, good.  Whoopi.  Yeah, baby.  Hi, Whoopi.  Hi, Whoopi.  What's your take on your show this morning on this whole thing?  Well, you know what?  As I said yesterday, you know, he didn't do anything illegal.  But we can't be surprised that people are calling for his resignation. 
[01:36:30]  They did it to Trent Lott.  They did it to Jimmy the Greek.  You know, there are four or five other people.  And I think at some point, I think people just got to the point where they said it was enough.  You know, it's not the first time that Armis has made some remarks like this.  Exactly, because he's based, really, and has based his whole career on comedy.  And you being a comic should know that that includes offending people.  Well, this is my take on it. 
[01:37:00]  I didn't know he was a comic, and that's the God's honest truth.  I know him only as a DJ from when I was a little kid.  So I don't know him as a comic.  Well, he's not as funny as we are, but he's in the comedy genre.  It's one of those things that if you're going to make comments like that,  you have to know somebody's going to get pissed off, and that's okay.  But, Whoopi, as a stand-up, it's like we have this thing where we know we're going to...  I'm not talking about being hateful, but people being offended should not cost you your job.  I mean, you did your first HBO special.  It was a great thing you did about going to the Anne Frank house. 
[01:37:30]  And even though your tone was different than Imus's,  that could have offended people that you were somehow using the Holocaust.  I mean, there's any way to twist something a comedian says,  and you can't lose your job for it, especially when he's laughing when he says it.  We know the tone of what he meant.  Well, here's the thing.  When I did the Anne Frank piece, it was a theater piece,  and everybody knew they were in seeing theater.  When you're listening to Don Imus, and he goes ahead and calls some black girls,  some black girls athletes who had just worked their behinds off 
[01:38:00]  and called some nappy-headed hoes, you've got to stop.  I completely disagree.  Completely.  The tone was he was making a joke.  And his show is based on comedy.  There was no hate behind what Mr. Imus said.  That is your take on it?  I don't know what his take on it was.  He says he wouldn't make it.  You're looking at it.  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  You're looking at it like, well, these are girls who worked really hard.  Whenever you take something that we make fun of,  and you look at it seriously for what it is,  well, then it's going to be tough to make fun of it. 
[01:38:30]  People make fun of the war.  Well, let me ask you this.  Why didn't he make fun of the Tennessee girls, too?  I think that was what Bernard's point about the wannabes and the jiggaboos  was with the Spike Lee thing was.  Yeah, but Spike Lee, he didn't call them little white trash jumpers or something.  I'm sure he wouldn't.  You know what I'm saying?  If you're going to make the joke, then you've got to know what you're talking about.  You've got to really be careful.  So he's got to make sure he jokes about every single person equally?  Are you kidding me?  I didn't hear you, baby.  He just went after that visual the other day. 
[01:39:00]  So he's supposed to make fun of, oh, if I'm going to make fun of the Rutgers women's  basketball team, now I better make fun of the Tennessee women's basketball team?  That's not how comedy works.  Maybe the next day he would have.  I'm sorry.  I heard you talking.  I didn't hear a thing you said.  He was basically...  Go down so I understand what you're saying to me.  Well, but he was saying that Imus made fun of the one team doesn't mean he has to make  fun of the other team.  That was just where the joke went.  Well, the joke fell flat.  Okay, it happens, but look at what happened with you and Ted Danson.  I'm sorry, listen.  This is not the first time Imus has stepped in it with race. 
[01:39:30]  Now, let's be honest.  He talked about a PBS reporter, Gwen Eiffel, as the cleaning.  He said, oh, it's nice to see the cleaning lady covering the Washington beat or whatever  that phrase is.  He also went after the interracial couple.  What is their name?  I don't have it in front of me.  They just put out a book.  But that's...  Okay, so it's a little tasteless.  Wait a minute.  Now, I listened really patiently.  All right.  So I think people are at the point, particularly people of color, and I think a lot of women 
[01:40:00]  are offended because this is, you know, it's hard enough being a female athlete for him  to have just sort of stepped in.  I think people are saying, you know what?  You got to deal with this.  And I, as I said yesterday, what he said was not illegal.  What he said was not, I think, definable.  But it was wrong.  It was morally wrong.  All right.  So you say it's wrong.  Should he be fired for that?  Do I think he should be fired?  He should be fired as much as Trent Lott was fired, as much as Jimmy the Greek was fired. 
[01:40:30]  Well, you're insane.  These are the consequences.  It's a Rush Limbaugh guy.  Jimmy the Greek wasn't a comedian when he said what he said.  The bottom line is...  I can't hear you.  When you look at something like Cheryl Underwood, look at the type of material she does and the  things she goes after.  Why is it...  I don't know who you're talking about.  Cheryl Underwood, she's a black female comic.  Uh-huh.  And she goes after race pretty hard.  She drops N-bombs.  Do we have a radio show?  Doesn't matter.  We're talking about the right...  No, no.  Excuse me.  Hold on.  No, no.  I'll answer you.  I don't know who...  Why should radio shows that do a comedy show be held to higher standards? 
[01:41:00]  Okay.  As like network news.  Are you crazy?  Listen...  We should be able to say whatever the hell we want when we do our program.  Excuse me.  God bless you.  Now, I'm willing to listen to you, but you know what?  If you're going to talk over me, I don't know who Cheryl Norton is, so I can't comment  on what she does.  No, Cheryl Underwood.  Not Cheryl Norton.  Cheryl Underwood.  No, Underwood.  You're Norton.  Yes.  Oh, sorry.  Please.  Hey, what about Ted Danson?  I don't want to talk about her because I don't know what she does.  I'm having a conversation with...  Whoopi, what about the Ted Danson incident?  You guys caught...  You were making a racial point. 
[01:41:30]  No, no, no.  Hang up.  But I'm saying...  Oh, see?  Hang up.  See?  See?  See?  Because you said the Ted Danson thing.  Why would she hang up on that?  Oh, another pussy.  Why would she hang up on that?  Holy cow.  Why would she hang up on the Ted Danson thing?  Another knockout punch for the boys!  But why would she hang up on that?  That was a very legitimate question.  That is an absolute valid point.  It's like...  How come it was okay when Ted Danson got in blackface and she came to his defense and that  was considered very offensive, very racist, and she came to his defense on that, but she 
[01:42:00]  will say that Imus should be fired for doing what he did, which was a bad joke and unbelievable.  And I wasn't even attacking her with that.  No.  My point was how can you defend one aspect of racial parody, but not another aspect of it.  Like when you're involved with it because you're black, it's okay.  Hang up.  Hang up.  You hear her?  Hang up Ted Danson.  Hang up.  Why?  Repeat after me.  Down goes Whoopi! 
[01:42:30]  Down goes Whoopi!  Wow.  People...  And we were just going to discuss it?  That was not even an attack.  That was a real question.  No.  It was honestly...  I just wanted to have a dialogue with the woman.  That's all.  What's your...  The Ted Danson thing offended a lot of people.  You've been on the other end of this and you know from your point of view how ridiculous  it was that people reacted that way.  So why is that acceptable and understandable and yet Imus' racial stuff is not?  That's phony.  Wow.  Why did she hang up?  She panicked. 
[01:43:00]  I didn't expect that.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Because we were cyborgasted there.  She doesn't want to go down that road.  They're calling from inside the building.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Hang up.  Oh wait a minute.  We were on their show too?  Yeah.  I would gather.  Why would they hang up on that?  Because a little pussy boy has to agree with everything Whoopi says.  But I don't...  I heard him in the background helping her along with her facts.  Chubby Cubby.  Is that his name?  No.  I swear to God.  Is it Cubby?  Cubby, yeah.  Why would they hang up on that?  A little cubby.  Oh, bravo.  Still undefeated.  So far, Dice, Man Queer, and Whoopi have hung up on us when confronted with anything. 
[01:43:30]  Only in the last two weeks, by the way.  Oh, God.  By the way.  What is wrong with her?  He has a radio show.  It's not legitimate because we're talking about the right to parody race and do things like  that without the consequences of losing your job.  Yeah.  Don't throw out he's got a show, but I did it here.  We're not talking about FCC violations.  How can a comedian that has been known over the years for doing very irreverent, very racially  based comedy like her, how could she call for the firing of somebody for doing that? 
[01:44:00]  And that's stupid.  And that Anne Frank question, here's my point with that.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Well, why are you as an artist allowed to use race or horrible things in your art and yet  he's not?  As much as you don't like it, as much as you think it's unpleasant as an artist, you  have that right?  Because she thinks it's unpleasant.  And so does he.  A lot of Jews might think, I don't care how you use it, the Holocaust is not appropriate  on a comedy spectrum.  For any kind of joking, right. 
[01:44:30]  By the way, very good observation from Wilkes-Barre, Chris Kaye, through the whole interview, whoopies,  I can't hear you, I can't hear you, I can't hear you, right?  She always said that to you, like your mic might not have been feeding to her, I don't  get that.  Well, Chris Kaye writes, of course she heard you guys that time.  Yeah, she heard that Ted Danson line.  But she couldn't hear every other line?  If someone gets her the audio, I would love to.  That's surprising.  I gotta hear that again.  Whoopi, why would you...  Hang up, hang up, hang up, hang up.  Hang up, hang up.  Hang up, hang up.  Hang up, hang up.  Hang up.  You know what?  Ted Danson, hang up. 
[01:45:00]  You've been on the end of this firestorm when it shouldn't have happened and you know  how stupid it is.  Whoopi, a little message to Whoopi, you're out of your league.  Go back to doing cute little things for women on your show.  Play it safe.  You can't hang with the big boys.  That was a legitimate question by Jimmy.  If they go for the Ted Danson thing, hang up.  But it was a real question.  Yeah, it was a real question.  And that was my point.  It wasn't to Sandbagger.  It was like, that's pretty common knowledge.  How can you say that when you stood in the firing squad and you knew how stupid it was?  When a white man is wearing blackface. 
[01:45:30]  You knew what he meant.  Yeah, and telling offensive jokes and you came to his defense.  On the surface, that looks racist and horrible, but in context, you knew what it was.  Yeah.  And you heard Imus laughing and it's against women.  Everybody wants to be victimized.  Whoopi, what a phony.  That really bugs me.  Hang up, hang up.  Why would you hang up?  I got to hear that again.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  Prank caller.  So then Sharpton goes on.  This is Paul Azan.  Getting back to that because Whoopi had a chicken out. 
[01:46:00]  She just played into her hands.  What can I tell you?  Look, I understand she was trying to make a point.  She didn't want to be talked over.  Okay, fine.  That was a very legitimate question.  That's going to annoy me all day.  Sharpton says he's done shows against Flavor Flav.  This is not about just him.  I've done, on my radio shows, whole shows condemning Flavor Flav and others that I disagreed with.  So I think that we must be clear here that we're not just talking about Imus, but that the defense of Imus is not, I'm not the only one.  Yeah, well, did you fight to have Flavor Flav's show removed? 
[01:46:30]  Did you scream as loudly about Flavor Flav?  Did you organize protests against Flavor Flav?  You phony?  No.  You fat fraud?  You did a whole show on nappy-headed hoes.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, that's the whole series.  That's what the whole show is based on.  You know what happens when there's a black artist or genre, rap music that degrades women or uses bad words?  They don't have a protest. 
[01:47:00]  They don't call for firings.  They have a summit.  Yes.  They word it differently.  Meetings.  They have meetings.  They have a rap summit.  They get together and discuss what can be done about this.  The second white people do something offensive, it's a protest, demonstrations, calls for firing.  It's treated differently.  So no matter what he says about how he disagrees with what Flavor Flav and other rap artists are doing, it's treated differently because they're black and the other artists are white. 
[01:47:30]  And instead of having a meeting or a summit or something that sounds nice, they want firings and protests.  Bravo.  By the way, Kevin from Marblehead, Massachusetts, according to official scores, Whoopi's hang up after hearing Ted Danson was timed at 2.4 seconds, not breaking the record held by Opie.  Dice, 1.4 seconds after hearing Opie.  They keep trying everything out there. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, Reverend Al Sharpton says he will continue trying to get Imus fired.  At the end of the day, do you think this guy's going to get fired or not?  At the end of the day, I think we're going to keep mobilizing to stop him and anyone else.  You didn't answer the question.  Anyone else?  See, this is why we, that people will mobilize and he will be fired.  Focus on his kid.  All right, Reverend Al Sharpton, thank you for your time tonight.  I appreciate your scurrying over him.  In a year, so of course everybody's talking about this race is a very sensitive issue.  Anyone else?  That's why we're talking about this today because they're going to come for us next.  Anyone else?  Anyone else that's just trying to do a comedy show that might slip? 
[01:48:30]  I can't believe a stand-up comic of that veteran status would take that kind of, it's not like they overheard him dropping an N-bomb and the mics were on where it was real.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know what he was doing.  And you know what?  Her audience did not hear that whatsoever because I guarantee they dumped out of that.  I just hope FMQB is listening.  Oh, whoopee.  Why?  Oh, we'll send the audio to FMQB.  We want everyone to know that she just wimped out.  Hang up, hang up, hang up.  You heard it on our end.  With a legitimate question. 
[01:49:00]  That had everything to do with the IMA situation.  That was absolutely related to this situation.  Hey, speaking of Reverend Al, we got to play a song once again.  Who knew that this song that we recorded, or Anthony recorded, God, it has to be eight years ago.  Eight years ago.  It's now popular again.  Because he hasn't changed in years.  Are you singing on this?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's Anthony.  It's Anthony.  This is the Reverend Al song.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the Ku Klux Klan? 
[01:49:30]  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob.  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's sapping off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his hair's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace. 
[01:50:00]  The man with a plan who you know you can trust.  The party little reverend with an ass just like a buzz.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Remember Bernie Getz and the brawly case.  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face. 
[01:50:30]  He's speeding in his limo to another homicide.  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  On the never-ending search for some good publicity.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's coming round.  I'm hungry.  He's Reverend Al.  Reverend Al. 
[01:51:00]  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee.  Now as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  Well, he's your pal.  That's right.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's a raised, faith-in' white, hatin' bag of full on me.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's Reverend Al.  I'm Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al. 
[01:51:30]  Reverend Al.  Now.  Well, we'll get the update in a minute.  All right.  Go.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Wow.  Across America.  True tales from the road.  Real people.  Real stories.  Real who?  She's on Arizona, baby.  Right by the U of A.  She is beautiful.  22-year-old blonde.  And the cans were fine. 
[01:52:00]  I just got wowed by the biggest fucking titties in Philadelphia.  Oh, Opie and Anthony.  Tommy from Jersey yesterday got wowed.  Had my 14-year-old son with me.  She also is nice enough to wow him, which means I'll probably never get in the bathroom again.  Thanks, guys.  Probably got my first wow down in Dallas the other day.  A young lady come on the CB radio asking if anybody out there had a wow sticker. 
[01:52:30]  I told her.  Pulled up beside her.  And she flashed them big old fun bags at me.  And she said she's a faithful listener for Darnham.  If you're listening, thank you very much.  That was very, very nice.  If you get wowed, call the Opie and Anthony wow line.  866-WOW-ME-05.  And if you need a wow sticker, go to opieandanthony.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202. 
[01:53:00]  Opie and Anthony.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Whoopie called off air to try to discuss it further.  I don't know what that does, but I don't know.  Her remarks on the Ted Danson thing was that I dealt with that X amount of years ago.  And I didn't want to talk about it.  She doesn't want to bring it up.  Hey, if you're going to comment in the papers about a racial thing that's happening and you've been there before. 
[01:53:30]  That is so similar, yeah.  Then you've got to stay out of this one.  Just keep your mouth shut.  People are going to bring up something that you were involved with that's similar.  Yeah.  I mean, look, here's the bottom line.  She gets what we're saying.  We get what she's saying.  We all just disagree on it.  That's the bottom line.  Yeah.  But I like the way she hung up like that.  I think that was like...  What bothers me is she's like, I had no idea that I'm instead of a comedy show.  I mean, come on.  Everyone knows that I'm as bases of a show on getting some laughs.  It sounds a little out of touch.  You think?  Just a tad. 
[01:54:00]  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  We've got famous people in our studio.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.  Hello.  Oh, God.  Look at you guys.  How are you?  Good.  Very well.  I'm going to put these on.  Very well, yeah.  Look, you don't want to be here.  Relax, man.  It's all right.  We've just been listening to the tirade that's going on in this place.  We've had a little episode on radio here.  Yeah, we heard.  In the U.S.  And you know how us Americans are very oversensitive about things.  Why can't we just take whatever crap is being said and just forget about it? 
[01:54:30]  Well, you guys have the racial tension in England, right?  Isn't it more with Muslims?  That's kind of like the black-white tension here.  I think there's racial tension everywhere.  We've just got to think carefully about what we say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's not.  I mean, I think if you go, if you launch into some racial tirade and then say, I'm only  kidding, it doesn't make it okay.  But I mean, you heard what I said, one little off-color thing.  Do you know what?  I don't even know who Imas is.  Oh, he's a big radio morning guy here.  Right.  And he just made like a tasteless joke about black people, which is a sin in this country, 
[01:55:00]  you know, because we're paying for 400 years of naughtiness.  Naughtiness?  Of naughtiness.  I think, you know, but we all kind of are.  We shouldn't, you know, we should kind of accept that, I think.  Yeah, but we can.  I mean, I know it's not your fault, personally.  Yeah.  But you can understand why people get sick of it, do you know what I mean?  Yeah, yes and no.  I think there's that kind of white, angry guilt where, hey, it's not our fault.  But I mean, you know.  Yeah.  Suck it up, do you know what I mean?  But then there's the other side, too, where you kind of sit there and go, all right, you 
[01:55:30]  know, you guys are joking about it.  Why can't we?  Yeah, but was he joking about it?  Was he?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Was it comedy?  Yes.  Yeah.  He was trying to.  Who laughed?  I think it kind of, you know, it didn't go over well.  It wasn't a hysterical, gut-buster joke.  It was a throwaway line, and then people in studio laughed.  I think we're just pissed off because kind of black people are kind of, I think they're  allowed to be a little bit annoyed.  Do you know what I mean?  I don't mind being.  I love Dave Chappelle. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  And I love when he kind of, like, hacks on us a little bit, and I think, oh, well, whatever.  Yeah, that's hysterical.  It's not racism.  It's just kind of like, it's kind of comedy pissed-offness.  Yeah.  No one goes crazy, though.  No one goes, oh, my God, Dave Chappelle's making fun of white people.  He needs to be pissed off at black people, does he?  Well, he's not pissed off at black people.  It wasn't based out of anger.  It was just a funny line.  It was just a line meant to be funny.  The intent was not to be, they didn't catch him off air dropping n-bombs.  He just said something on air.  He was kind of, like, tagging a line that somebody else had used.  It was, like, a natural flow of conversation.  Do you think he does drop n-bombs off air?  I hope so. 
[01:56:30]  Off air?  Conflict.  How can you not?  It's the comedy again.  I'm only kidding.  I'm only kidding.  Well, these guys aren't here to talk about racism and the state of the world today.  We're here to talk about our film Hot Fuzz.  Hot Fuzz, yes.  I saw it.  Did you?  Yes.  You saw Hot Fuzz already?  It's a little advanced screening.  Nice.  I did.  I thought it was hysterical.  Totally different from Shaun of the Dead. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Your character, very different.  You play, like, one of these real kind of...  Super cop.  Super cop cop guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And meanwhile, you know, you're kind of a fun-loving, kind of innocent guy in Shaun of the Dead.  I figured I had to play somebody a bit different in this, do you know what I mean?  Because I played a couple of slackers, and I thought, right, let's play a super cop.  Badass.  Yeah, yeah, badass.  And I've got to say, I won't give away, of course, the end of the movie, but there is a gun sequence in there that I was not expecting.  I was like, wow, these guys, like, spent some money on this movie or something. 
[01:57:30]  Well, we're kind of...  We're massive fans of, like, American action films and, you know, the kind of cop genre,  and we thought, wouldn't it be funny if we took that and we stuck it into a little English village?  Yeah.  And had things blow up there instead of the streets of L.A. or New York.  Yeah, because usually there's huge cities and the cops running around and things are blowing up and car chases and gunfights.  And it's just this small, quaint little English village.  Yeah, we don't have any, like, a tradition of cop films in the U.K.  because our cops aren't armed, right?  They just...  Yeah.  They have sticks. 
[01:58:00]  Kind of silly.  You guys laugh at that, but it takes a lot of balls to walk into a bad neighborhood with a stick.  Yeah.  Right?  And not with a gun on your hip.  But it means that, filmically, it's not so good for kind of, like, you know, action and adventure.  Yeah.  Because hitting each other with sticks...  It doesn't give the same...  You can't have a slow motion.  No!  And the guy gets hit with a little stick.  You know, it kind of takes away from the climax of the whole thing.  Ow, my shoulder.  Yeah.  So...  The, uh, Shaun of the Dead, of course, uh, you, you, you had done movies before that?  Uh, no, we've done it. 
[01:58:30]  We had a sitcom on British television.  Yeah.  That was it.  I'd done a couple of movies, but not, like, the scale of Shaun of the Dead.  Yeah, that could, that one really hit a nerve.  I mean, total cult following here in the States.  That's great, yeah.  And people watch it, like, ten times.  It's one of those movies you just watch over and over again and still laugh your ass off.  Uh, a fan of, of the zombie genre, obviously.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, there were so many little, uh, homages to, uh, to all the, uh, old zombie movies.  Where'd that come from?  We're just, I mean, we're a huge zombie.  I remember I made Nick up here. 
[01:59:00]  Say hi.  Hey.  Nick Frost.  Hello.  Hi.  As a zombie in 1994 for Halloween.  And ten years later, we were here promoting our big zombie film, which was quite a nice little  circular journey, wasn't it?  Yeah, I still got the mic up on.  You guys stand-ups, too?  Uh, do you start as stand-ups?  I was a stand-up, yeah.  I was a stand-up for about, uh, ten years and then got back into, uh, I got into acting  through that, got the sitcom, you know.  And I, I still love doing stand-up, but it's just, you can't do both, do you know what 
[01:59:30]  I mean?  Because your whole weekends take, you work Thursday to Sunday and you gotta spend, basically  when you're a stand-up, you spend all weekend in a pub and not drink.  Yeah.  Unless, unless you're a drinking stand-up.  It's a grunt.  It would dull my edge if I drunk, do you know what I mean?  You have two types of stand-ups, guys that have no alcohol at all or the guys that you're  peeling off the floor every night at three o'clock in the morning.  But I think the guys that drink, stand-ups that drink, think they're funnier than they  are, do you know what I mean?  You know when you get a bit drunk and you think, ah, I said something really funny last  night and you read what you wrote, scrawled down and you think, no, that's rubbish.  And it's the same as, you know, I think it's always better to stay a little sharp. 
[02:00:00]  Also, you've got to be on the balls, you know, with the audience, because if they're coming  back at you, you need to be sharp, so.  You can't just go, ah.  Yeah.  Leave it at that.  Because they're the worst, the worst hecklers are drunk people.  Yeah, get off you, idiot.  And you come back with someone lying, no, I didn't hear you.  You know, it's kind of like.  Yeah, it's not going to work.  It's even worse with the audience when somebody heckles you and you destroy them, but the audience  didn't quite hear what they said and the audience hides with them.  You just blow towards the entire room.  Absolutely.  How'd you get, how'd you get the, like, idea for Shaun of the Dead and, like, get the cat, 
[02:00:30]  like, because it's one of those things where, oh, I want to make a movie.  And then.  Well, we were doing our show Spaced and there was a little scene in it when I was kind of  lost on, in a video game.  My character had been up all night on speed and kind of was playing Resident Evil and  sort of got sucked into the game.  And we had such fun shooting the zombie bit.  Me and Edgar Wright, who's the director and co-writer, said, let's make a film.  Let's see if we can make a film.  So we took the idea around.  Eventually it got picked up by work in title and universal and we got it made.  And it was, it was luck. 
[02:01:00]  It was, you know, a lot of luck involved, but we, we got there.  And the writing of it.  Now you wrote it, uh, with, uh, with, uh, Edgar, uh, cause I noticed it wasn't like just  a traditional little comedy on zombie thing.  It was actually like, you know, your character is very sensitive and there was some like touching  moments that were like sad.  It's like to decide to bring that into a comedy zombie movie I thought was a little, uh, odd,  but it definitely worked.  Yeah.  I, you know what, you know, when you have those films that are like, that are just, I don't 
[02:01:30]  know, this sort of spoof movies, like epic movie or whatever, they, they, they really  do exist joke to joke, right?  So if one joke fails, the whole thing fails.  Whereas if you have, I think if you have like some, some story underneath and some characters  and something to invest yourself in, you can, you know, you can go off joke a little  while and actually get things a little bit emotional.  And then, so when I have to shoot my mom, it's pretty sad, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  It was like, he's sitting there going, Oh my God, the guy's got to shoot his mother.  She's a zombie.  And you know, he's yelling at the other guy not to shoot her and he's crying and everything. 
[02:02:00]  It's just good to keep people on their toes, you know, a good dynamic.  There's no moment, like the naked guns have no moments like that.  Cause it's all just boom, boom, boom.  They're the best.  I mean, they're the kind of best examples of those.  Like the Zucker brothers, like airplane, Mel Brooks, Frank, young Frankenstein, blazing  styles.  Brilliant.  Because they are all the jokes pretty much hit.  Whereas, you know, because as the, as that sort of, that kind of movie gets a bit diluted,  it gets, you know, less and less of a hit rate.  Uh huh.  So, uh, so anyway, so with hot flowers, it was, we kind of try and do the same thing, make 
[02:02:30]  something that could actually exist without the jokes.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  And you definitely pull it off.  Even though there's like, but there's loads of jokes in there.  Don't get me wrong.  It's really funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if you took it out of that, it could just be like a genuine action movie.  Well, it's like planes, trains, and automobiles.  I think it's a great comedy with Steve Martin, who I think sucks now, but back then he was  great with John Candy.  And there's some like really weird, kind of depressing moments.  Hey, John Candy really tugs the heartstrings in that movie.  Great.  Yeah.  Just a big, fat, sad man.  Yeah.  You can, you can make fun of me. 
[02:03:00]  A little eyes filled with tears.  Go on, I'm an easy target.  He has that head and mustache, the greatest.  He was fantastic.  Now, what about direction?  Who directed Edgar?  Edgar Wright is my sort of co-writer.  And we always, Nick is always the kind of the first guy that gets the script.  And we write for Nick in mind, for me and Nick to be in it together.  And then, and then we bring everyone else in.  So with Shaun of the Dead, we had a kind of, you know, it was a group of about six survivors  in that.  But with Hot Fuzz, there's like 50 speaking parts. 
[02:03:30]  And, you know, Timothy Dalton's in it.  And Jim Broadbent.  And Edward Woodward.  And Billy Whitelaw.  And, you know, these kind of, these kind of legends of the British sort of screen industry.  Yeah, there's, there's just like, it's a very unique look to the movies too, the direction.  Yeah.  You know, some of those, you know, the way the camera pushes in, a lot of quick cuts.  Yeah.  Like that.  And it makes it work.  Definitely.  I got 6,000 cuts in this film.  It is 6,000 cuts.  Wow.  Epileptics beware.  I got to see it.  Yeah, you get a Pokemon seizure. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Hey, Nick, did you, I'm sorry, did you start out like as an actor or as a sketch guy?  No, I was just a waiter and he made me do it.  How great is that?  He was.  I found him working in a restaurant.  Really?  I said, I can take you away from all this.  What was it about him when you, when you saw him?  I was just, I was just.  Just look at him.  A lot of sexual chemistry.  I get you in movies.  I was, yeah, I was a stand-up comic and he was the funniest guy I knew and I was hanging  out with stand-up comics and, you know, he was just the guy that worked in a restaurant  and I kind of introduced him to stand-up thinking, I mean, you kind of want 
[02:04:30]  to do it a little bit, didn't you?  You sort of, as a way out of working.  I didn't really want to be a waiter forever.  I didn't really know what to do apart from that, but it was, I did ten gigs and five  were amazing where I was hailed as the new Christ and the other five were the, that was  the lowest points of my career, of your life, of my life.  So, when we came to do our sitcom, I said, look, well, do it this way, be in it and I  wrote him a part of a character that he kind of came up with and it took off from there 
[02:05:00]  and, you know, it's like ten years later and he's got his own show and everything.  How long were you guys on in England for?  How long were you on for, yeah?  How many years?  Oh, the show?  Yeah, yeah.  It ran for two seasons and then we did, and then we did Shaun of the Dead and then we kind  of had to leave it behind in a way.  And it's the question we get asked the most, is they're going to do a third season of Space?  Because people have found it here.  You can't get it region one DVD here, but people can import it and they, you know, have  regionalist DVDs and stuff, but I think it's going to get released here on DVD. 
[02:05:30]  You know what I saw which is pretty funny in England I really enjoyed was Alan Partridge.  Yeah, I was in that.  Were you in that?  Yeah, yeah, I was in an episode of Alan Partridge.  I like season two better because the first season was just, he's just on his show.  That's right.  And then season two, what an ass he was.  He was just really a funny guy.  I was pretty in character.  I don't know if you remember the episode where they drop a cow on him from a bridge.  Some farmers are protesting because he said, weirdly enough, he said some controversial  things about farming, about, what was it, genetically modified swans, hens, whose necks have been 
[02:06:00]  bred to be fit in a baguette, wasn't it?  Big-eyed boy.  Fit in a baguette.  And so these farmers drop a cow on him from a bridge, but I was in that episode.  And I was only like 27 and it was one of my first TV shows and it was with Coogan, who's  an amazing sort of comedy actor.  And he's in Hot Fuzz.  Is he really?  Yeah, yeah.  He's a funny dude.  He's very funny.  When does Hot Fuzz open?  420.  I think you know what we're saying.  420.  Enjoy the day.  Gotcha.  This is how stupid I am.  You said 420 and I'm such a nerd. 
[02:06:30]  I didn't catch it.  You looked at your watch.  Yeah.  What a boy to say April.  What a jolt.  I didn't catch him saying that.  And I apologize to Nick because I asked for a picture, but I looked at you and I looked  at the other guy who you were with that fell on the back.  So my apologies.  Vijay the Bone.  Vijay the Bone Carbone.  He's looking after us.  Shout out to Vijay.  So yeah, go see because it'll be a great day.  It will.  Yeah.  Like I said, I saw it.  It was really funny.  What's been weird?  I can't do it to some marijuana.  Head out.  You guys get stoned and write. 
[02:07:00]  A lot of people do it.  They'll just...  I wouldn't like to say, really.  It's definitely not a nut.  A lot of mystery.  You know what's weird is that we've been doing this tour of the U.S. showing the film and  stuff.  And the film did great in the...  I mean, it did amazing.  We broke records in the U.K.  It's kind of like the sixth biggest opening ever in the U.K.  Wow.  And yet the audiences here seem to get it more than the British audiences.  Yeah.  Because I think they get what we've adopted more.  Do you know what I mean?  Because it's like an American sort of format.  The whole action thing.  Right. 
[02:07:30]  The action thing.  It becomes an American film.  Yeah.  And they've been getting it so...  It's been crazy.  It's been great.  It's like being in a rock band.  Did I have to go through gun training and stuff?  Yeah, we did.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not that we need to.  Hey, is he pulling out again?  He's gone for a while.  He's back in.  He's back in.  That's that question.  He goes in.  Pulls out a phone.  Yeah, because you're pretty proficient with the guns in that movie.  You could usually just have a little revolver in him.  He keeps a revolver in his sock anyway.  Yeah.  Don't want to mess up the line or the cut of him.  You know what somebody to rob you for?  You get a polo jacket in the seat. 
[02:08:00]  Exactly.  It's nice to be able to come over here and pack heat.  You know, we don't get that privilege in the U.K.  You don't get that in the U.K.  No, they don't let you.  Given them on the plane.  Yeah.  I don't really sign your declaration form.  You pick them up at immigration.  You get given that in your little green thing in your passport.  Hey, in England, I've never worked over there.  Is there any, like, here we know, like, there's certain things in comedy, whether it's in films.  Here's mostly racial stuff that people panic about.  Is there anything with you guys that's more cultural for you that is just a no-no in comedy  or something that people are really going to give you a problem with?  I think it's the same. 
[02:08:30]  I think pretty much it's just, you know, it's just taking responsibility for what you say.  Do you know what I mean?  It depends on what you're trying to.  I think it's always good to make people think.  I think it's always good to sort of inspire debate as well.  I think if, you know, if this fellow on the radio, if he was saying that to kind of try  and get a big debate going and make something good happen, then great.  Do you know what I mean?  Comedy is a great way of sort of rehearsing real ideas.  But ultimately, you know, I don't know.  Let's agree to disagree on that one. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, what's your line?  I like that.  I love that line.  It gets you out of anything.  Yeah.  Hey, guys, 420.  420.  Big plug.  Hot fuzz will change your life.  And I guarantee if you go with somebody on a date, they will have sex with you afterwards.  They'll be that amped up.  You can tell me to take Jimmy.  It's funny.  You stole the joke that, of course, my brain didn't think of.  But I was going to point at Kenny and say I was going to take him.  But you pointed at me because I'm here, which worked.  Kenny actually was a cop.  Oh, really? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, and believe me.  My PD?  No, he was Jersey.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Jersey.  We've seen Copland.  He got thrown off.  What did you get thrown off for?  For getting on stage and telling dirty jokes.  No shit.  Naughty.  Oh, I just cursed.  I thought I was on XM for a second.  I dropped the S-bomb.  Now you're in trouble.  I know.  You're fired.  Somebody with a button in the back that just dumps out of that.  Because God forbid the children hear that.  I know.  They're all saying that.  We heard some CBS guys talking. 
[02:10:00]  They're thinking of releasing some gas in here to purge your sins.  You guys picked a weird day to come in.  I mean, we're big fans, but we're pretty heated about what's going on.  Oh, my God.  Huge.  Because it affects everyone that does this type of radio.  The radio.  You guys get down all over it all day.  Recognized everywhere now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  A bit.  Especially together.  It must just be insane.  Yeah, I think it kind of completes a little sort of jigsaw.  It's nice, though.  You know, everyone that sort of comes up is always really friendly.  And, you know, comedy fans are always sort of good people, I think. 
[02:10:30]  They kind of want to laugh, so they're nice folks.  Yeah.  You guys get, like, there's the little catchphrases and stuff that Americans love using.  Because all the time now, I just, whenever the phone's busy, I'll be, it's engaged.  Engaged.  Because we never use that.  It's like, it's busy.  Oh, really?  Or something like that.  Or, you know, I'll pick up a bit of wood.  Chase you around with a bit of wood.  Those are fun things to say.  If you're American.  Queue up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's funny, isn't it?  We kind of speak the same language, but we don't, in a way.  But we don't, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fun to imitate.  Do English people just imitate stupid American words and accents?  Hell yeah!  Do you go up doing American accents all the time?  Because Americans seem to just want to go around and go, oh, where are you going?  Yeah.  There's a funny thing with the British.  You know, so many people here, and often girls will, oh, I just love your accent.  Yeah.  It's great.  And you're like, why?  Because they think you sound like a prince or something.  That's what it is.  It puts you on this little higher plateau.  It doesn't matter.  You could be a homeless English guy and just be like, oh, it's a titan.  We do lay on quite thick.  Yes, we do walk a bit. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Hello, ladies.  Welcome.  Good morning, madam.  Great.  We have, we are leaving.  That's why the music is.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Sure, sure.  With Simon Pegg and Nick Frost in theaters Friday, April the 20th, which is a week from Friday.  It's called Hot Fuzz.  Yeah.  So go see it.  And start already.  Love it.  You're like Sean the Dead, man.  It's going to be another hit for these guys.  Love it.  Thank you guys for coming in.  You guys go have a lie down.  Okay.  Calm down.  All right.  Have a lie down.  See ya.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, thank you so much. 
[02:12:00]  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:12:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  I dropped the S-bomb over there.  You're a potty mouth.  I was on a dump sheet today.  There were two dumps today.  Anthony at 851, no shit.  And 719, I said I came.  And who was on their best behavior?  Jimmy Norton.  That's right.  Mr. Clean Mouth.  That's right.  I understand you don't have to be vulgar to be funny, but apparently that lesson is lost. 
[02:16:00]  Excuse me.  We got to say hi to Jim M.  He did the intro, and I love it.  That was Jim M.  You will be hearing that the rest of the week.  That was very funny.  You guys, it's been my coffee.  That's too funny.  Jen from Virginia.  Ha ha.  Goopiest thing I've ever heard.  Don't like that one.  Don't like that one.  I like it.  It was a cappella ecstasy of gold.  One person said it's so bad.  It's great.  You should play it every day.  Best yet.  Retarded Bobby McFerrin. 
[02:16:30]  This is the best theme yet.  Kick brother Joe's to the curb.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  It just goes on and on.  Oh, wow, guys.  Bobby McFerrin really has gone downhill since Don't Worry Be Happy.  Someone said it sounded like the Muppets on acid.  That was horrible.  That sucked.  That was great.  There you go.  That's what we want to do with this show is make you react.  What's going on with Al Roker?  Al Roker has gone from just jolly fat man who stands by Matt Lauer to militant, militant black guy. 
[02:17:00]  Are you kidding me?  Everyone's jumping on the bandwagon now.  Here's what Al Roker is.  Al Roker has been tap dancing with white people for the last 20 years on television,  and now this is his first chance to make a quote-unquote poignant statement about race.  Make a stand because everyone is jumping on it.  Where have you been all these years, Al, while you're fucking running around like a little bitch 
[02:17:30]  on a morning show under an umbrella?  Where's all this fucking racial poignancy and pride been?  So all of a sudden, he's the voice of a black man.  Well, let me read this, and you guys, you know, let's comment a little bit.  Rocker.  Rocker.  Jesus.  Roker.  Jesus.  Al Roker.  Holy shit.  Roker says, time for Imas to go.  From Al Roker.  Rocker, I cannot tell you how many.  I have to jump in there.  He can tell us.  Go ahead, Park.  I cannot tell you how many people have asked me about my.  Another one about Ecstasy of Gold. 
[02:18:00]  They're starting to use Jimmy's.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  I said that the first time at a wake.  I knew there was another one I wanted to get out there, but someone just wrote.  Hilarious.  Hilarious, people.  All right.  I cannot tell you how many people have asked me about my thoughts on Don Imus as a student  of broadcasting.  Are you?  Student.  You're a fat man under an umbrella.  You're a weather dude.  That's like the worst job you could get in broadcasting.  I don't give a shit you do it for a national morning show. 
[02:18:30]  You're fucking Mary Poppa into the stapled stomach.  You'll fuck yourself.  Fucking fat pig.  You couldn't control yourself.  So you had to have a glimmer and staple everything up, didn't you, Al?  Very full of shit.  I couldn't stop eating that sweet potato pie.  I think Al Roker wanted to be a little bigger than a weatherman.  Fat cut with an umbrella.  I mean, the deal in broadcasting, fellow broadcasters laugh at the weatherman.  That's the lowest job you could get where you're actually on camera or on a microphone.  He's a stupid umbrella.  Oh, no.  Traffic girl's worse. 
[02:19:00]  Traffic girl than what you do.  You're the drummer of the news band.  We're the bassist.  No, no, no.  The tambourine player.  Mary Poppins fatso.  You should be singing just a spoonful of sugar makes those toes come off.  Those toes come off.  Fuck you and your fucking stitched-up belly, fat boy with no control.  The nerve of you to try to be poignant at age 59.  Where were you all these years while fucking Katie and her camel toe were running around  tee-hee-hee and everything?  Fucking, you've meant nothing, stupid. 
[02:19:30]  CNN has a poll.  60% of the people think that it's good enough and Imus should not be fired.  As a student of broadcasting, I know Don Imus was one of the original shock jocks.  I listened to him growing up in New York City in the late 60s and early 70s.  So, what's different?  You know how bad he used to be?  This is tame compared to what Imus used to do.  He's a radio icon.  That said, it is time for him to go.  Ah, thank you.  I, for one, am really tired of the diatribes, the humor at others' expense, the cruelty 
[02:20:00]  that passes for funny.  Don Imus isn't the only one doing this, but today he is the one in the hot seat.  See, the cruelty is funny.  His diatribes are funny.  He's a master of the language.  That's the beauty of Imus.  When he was trashing Mark Chernoff on time and he goes, hey, he sent me a mousy little  email.  Mousy.  A mousy little email.  Imus' language has made me laugh for 25 years.  It's the way he speaks.  He's brilliant.  What he said was violent and disgusting.  It denigrated an entire team and, by extension, a community and its pride in a group that has 
[02:20:30]  excelled.  Excuse me.  Can I request something here?  Again, this is, by making fun of the team, you've somehow included the whole community.  Yeah.  Yet, if one of those, say that was a male basketball team and one of them committed a  rape, if you, by proxy, why wouldn't they consider that, including the whole community?  Right.  Why?  The whole community, oh, so you're all rapists?  Because, why?  Black people are the first ones yelling, how could you judge everyone by one person?  Everyone's an individual, yet he makes fun of a team and that's the whole community. 
[02:21:00]  Just another phony statement by a black guy who wants to get his face in the media these  days by fucking jumping on some cornball bandwagon because he doesn't have any balls to make  a real statement about race.  Big California raisin head.  Oh, he's awful with his stupid glasses.  Why don't you get your eyes fixed, fatso?  Why don't you staple your awful corneas like you did your stomach?  This controversy started and grew during the week.  Staple your corneas.  At first.  That's very good.  At first, under the radar, we even had Don's wife, Deidre, on the program talking about 
[02:21:30]  green cleaning.  I thought she was so good, I wanted to talk to her about a television program from my production  company.  Did you?  At first, under the radar, we had Don and his wife have done a lot of good things, raising  money for charity, including a ranch for children suffering from cancer and blood disorders.  Can I, can I, again, right there, is that pretty much everything?  They fucking have a ranch for children with cancer and blood disorders and he's passing  it over.  Like, it's just one of a few things.  I think it shows, you know, Imus' character.  I think your actions should definitely take precedent over your words that you say when 
[02:22:00]  you're a comedian on the radio.  And this isn't a whole fucking sermon he was giving.  It was a line that flew out of his mouth during a bit.  And then his actions are so much bigger than that one circumstance.  But they want to take the actions that he does and toss him away.  Oh, yeah, he does this and it's all great and good.  But look what he said.  Shut up.  Yet, then, Imus needs to be fired for what he said. 
[02:22:30]  And while we're at it, his producer, Bernard McGurk, needs to be canned as well.  McGurk is just as guilty, often egging Imus on.  He had to mention food, didn't he?  He just couldn't not talk without mentioning food of some sort.  Egging.  Scrambled egging him on.  Oh, he's fucking rotten.  I like to drop a penny inside of his little belly and listen to it plink.  A little shrink-change person.  Inside the dollop of stew he had last night for dinner.  Just a dollop of stew, honey, because I couldn't control myself. 
[02:23:00]  I didn't know how to say no.  I'm standing under an umbrella like a little fat Mary Poppins.  I hope he has a spoonful of sickle cell.  Fucking makes me sick, fat boy.  The, I'm a good person who said a bad thing, apology doesn't cut it.  Well, at least he didn't try to weasel out of this by hiding behind alcohol or drug abuse.  Or compulsive overeating that he needed his stomach stapled for.  Oops.  Fucking nervy you.  Still, he said it in a two-week suspension, doesn't cut it. 
[02:23:30]  It is, at best, a slap on the wrist.  A vacation.  Nothing.  Speaking of slap on the wrist, you think Al ever got one while reaching into a cookie jar before dinner?  Plenty.  Probably not, that's why.  Fatso, keep your hand off the cookies alone, tubby.  But I was molested.  I wanted to cover it or something.  Oh, shut up, fatso.  The general manager of Cartoon Network resigned after a publicity stunt went wrong and caused a panic in Boston.  He did the right thing.  Don Imus should do the right thing and resign.  Not talking about taking a two-week suspension with dignity.  I don't think Don Imus gets it. 
[02:24:00]  After watching and listening to him this morning during an interview with Matt Lauer.  I gotta hear that.  Yeah, we got it right here.  Where is it?  Right here, I got it.  Don Imus doesn't get it.  Maybe it's being stuck in a studio for 35 years or being stuck in the 1980s.  Either way, it's obvious that he needs to move on.  Citing context without a, sorry, citing context within a comedy show is not an excuse.  Oh, it's not?  Really?  Then how about Dave Chappelle when Chappelle was doing his show on Comedy Central? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  That was in the context of comedy.  If he did the bits that he did, Dave Chappelle, in any other context but comedy, it would have been a crime, I believe.  Yeah.  But under the context of comedy, it's very funny.  Chris Rock, under the context of comedy, does his act, which he gets down on black people, a lot of the black stereotypes.  If Chris Rock was a politician, he would be called an Uncle Tom for some of the shit he says. 
[02:25:00]  But it's under the context of comedy.  A stupid Al Roker, it means everything, the context.  Of course it does.  That's why, that's what comedy is.  You take painful things and you somehow talk about them.  That's what comedy is supposed to be.  Let's see the context of your weather broadcast.  When it's on the show, people watch and wonder if they have to take an umbrella.  When you're at a party talking and they're bored fuckless walking away from you,  because that's all you have to offer to a cocktail party. 
[02:25:30]  The context, so shove those little wieners in your mouth.  Shove those little fucking pigs in a blanket in your little piggy belly.  I bet his stomach can handle, I can handle one half of a cocktail weenie.  One cocktail weenie and no blanket.  I gotta strip the blanket off of the piggy.  I know, he like...  One cold piggy.  A little fridge frost on it.  Have a cold piggy, you big one.  What the hell does he know?  He's a weatherman.  He knows nothing.  Weatherman is getting in on this. 
[02:26:00]  He knows about cold fronts.  Yeah.  And warm fat fronts.  And big rears.  And nor'easters.  Yeah, what is he getting involved in this sport?  A clipper system.  He's awful.  Shut up.  He's standing there with Matt and Katie for the last 20 years.  Don't try to be poignant now, stupid.  It's too late.  He has to take his punishment and start over.  Guess what?  He'll get rehired and we'll go on like nothing happened.  Oh, really?  CBS Radio and NBC News need to remove Don Imus from the airwaves.  That is what needs to happen.  Otherwise, it just looks like profits and ratings rule over decency and justice. 
[02:26:30]  Decency and justice.  What the fuck kind of justice is...  You know something?  Wraith war!  It's just irritating.  It's just irritating.  That a guy like Al...  Don't make me play my blazing saddles, Cliff.  He's never said anything poignant before.  I've never heard of him making any kind of...  Any type of editorial comment on the news...  On the show he's on.  Well, Al's getting a little risque.  Here's a line from the Today Show. 
[02:27:00]  Hey, where are the white women at?  Ah, see?  Well, there.  See?  Josh from...  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Josh from Connecticut.  Al wouldn't know comedy if he ate it and it split his stomach staples.  And people are saying, come on, leave Roker alone.  Oh, stop.  Leave him alone.  I heard talking outside, so I figured it was the listeners.  But can we have the mics on outside?  The listeners are quiet.  It's our guys.  Can you tell them just to have the mics on?  Is it?  Yeah, of course it is.  Mics are on. 
[02:27:30]  No, no, no, no.  But I'm saying I can hear them chatting.  But it's our dopey staff.  That's yapping and we can hear them.  I kind of like hearing that.  I don't.  It just makes it all busy like we're actually like working.  We're not.  I know.  Shut up!  Shut up!  We like the perception.  That sounded just like the clip.  I know.  It was a live version.  Hilarious!  Hilarious!  Hilarious people!  Hilarious people!  That's my new one.  Get that as my fucking ringtone.  Love that one.  I'm going right to hilarious.  Hilarious!  Hilarious!  Hilarious people! 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Imus and Sharpton.  This is the brand new audio.  You know, maybe tomorrow we'll back off a little bit, but it's all about this today.  Oh, it's got to be.  Come on.  But remind me about my seats for Shea Stadium.  Oh, yeah.  Is it online?  It's online.  All right.  You know what?  There it is.  We'll save that, though.  Oh, that's great.  So people, you know what?  I think I look good finally today.  Yeah, this could have.  I think this bailed you out.  I think this finally bails me out because I was bitching that XM didn't give me good  seats for the home opener.  And people were ragging it because it's free seats, home opener. 
[02:28:30]  They're like, you know, fucking Opie.  Why is he such an ingrate?  Hey, you wanted better seats.  And I didn't ask for the seats.  Wow.  Is I was really talking to Jesse?  Now he's like has to listen to what Jesse Jackson is going to tell him.  I don't know.  Is that live?  I guess it is.  Yeah, just.  I don't know.  It looked like they were talking at the same time.  So it's probably Jesse babbling.  Let's get a little Jesse.  Maybe MSNBC.  You should just leave IMAS on all day.  It'll be the biggest ratings in TV history.  The IMAS network. 
[02:29:00]  IMAS in the morning network.  It gets down to just some dude in Alabama.  At 11 a.m., the Rutgers team is going to talk about controversy.  Oh, wow.  And I'll bet they're going to talk about healing in the community.  MSNBC.  And you know what the N stands for?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nappy.  Nappy, of course, yes.  Or.  Or nappy.  Whoa, hey, hey, hey.  Anyway, go to opianathlete.com, and I sent Danny to the game.  I didn't ask for these seats for the home opener. 
[02:29:30]  No.  And I looked really bad.  What can I tell you?  I just speak my mind.  Certainly.  And Danny went to the game with a couple buddies, and he sat in my actual seat that XM Satellite  Radio gave me.  You look at that picture on opianathlete.com, and even if you hate me as a person, you can't  disagree with me anymore.  And that's all I'll say, and we'll get into why.  Why everyone should agree.  Look.  Danny sent this.  Turn around to me.  Danny sent this picture.  Look at that.  That's my seat.  Last night, and we were laughing. 
[02:30:00]  Me and my girlfriend were laughing our asses off, going, you've got to be shitting me.  He got an obstructed view seat in Shea Stadium.  Yeah, he's behind the foul pole.  Literally behind the foul pole.  But that's good, though, because it was the umpire for a day program.  Fucking stupid Elo.  Jesus.  Where you're just yelling, fair ball.  You guys saw that?  Yeah, they saw it out there.  Oh, it's horrid.  Now what do you have to say?  That could be the worst seat in the entire stadium.  Could be.  No, that is the worst seat. 
[02:30:30]  I'm keeping an open mind.  Adam, how many seats did you check?  There might be a worst seat.  How many seats?  400.  About 56,000 seats.  56,000?  What did you say?  400?  Yeah.  Perhaps a few more than that, Jim.  Perhaps a few more than that, Jim.  Chop, chop, karate.  The biggest home opener for the Mets ever, and I believe that Elo gave me the worst seat  possible.  All right.  Well, no, there's one other that's just as bad, and that would be the left field foul pole.  The other one, yeah.  The other side.  Right.  Me and some other dude.  Worst seats in the house.  Go see it for yourself.  VopeAndAnthony.com. 
[02:31:00]  It's on PalTalk right now.  They're laughing their balls off.  See?  Is I'm just going to be fired?  What do you think, man?  I don't know.  I don't know.  We've been there.  Right now, I'm really going to try to picture myself and our show in that situation.  Right now, too close to call.  This was at the point where we would have been like, dude, if we slide this, we're in  good shape.  We got a lot of press, but we'd be really nervous.  And it does come down to how much money it makes for the company.  And his ratings are kind of shaky across the board, but he does well in the demos that 
[02:31:30]  they need to sell advertising.  It makes a lot of money, yeah.  And the advertising for that show is through the roof.  So I think they're going to try to hang on to him.  If it was anybody else that wasn't doing that great, they would just get rid of him immediately  and make this go away.  What I think might help him is, A, all the good things he's done charity-wise.  You cannot deny that.  The fact that he has a lot of friends in politics who use his show to say what they want.  And also, the fact that he is getting...  They publicly said two-week suspension, so that will give it time to die down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'll see. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, here's Imus and Sharpton on the Today Show.  This is the latest audio.  Although now there's even latest, latest audio because Jesse Jackson is talking to this right  now.  It's actually Imus and Idi Amin.  Another clip of me on that.  No.  Hold on.  Maybe my mic didn't work.  Idi Amin.  Yeah.  It worked.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  It takes for nothing.  That was for you, Jimmy, because you liked that shame on you. 
[02:32:30]  I love that shame on you.  That's what the doctors said to Al when they took their shirt off and they realized they  had to operate on that.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  He actually went into the emergency room holding an umbrella and they're like, you can  let this go.  And he's like, but it might rain on my head.  You have to scoop my fat out with a spatula.  With an ice cream scoop.  By the way, people are begging you to stop at the umbrella.  I can't stop.  You're killing people.  I don't care.  They're dying.  Oh, I thought they hated it.  No, they love it.  Oh, tough titty, Alan. 
[02:33:00]  Umbrella.  That's actually what he shits into.  He doesn't have a toilet.  He actually just balances on an umbrella.  It's actually a hard toboggan with a stick.  And he calls it, this is my umbrella toilet.  Fuck you, fat boy.  All right, here we go.  This is from this morning.  Matt, S. Imus, what do you think of the suspension?  And here we go.  How are you, Matt?  I'm all right, thanks.  What do you think of the suspension?  Two weeks from CBS, two weeks of the simulcast from MSNBC.  What do you think of the nature and the scope of the punishment?  I think it's appropriate. 
[02:33:30]  And I am going to try to serve it with some dignity and a lot of dignity if I can.  I've had a long relationship going back to 1971 with the people at NBC.  And a long relationship with CBS.  And when I talked to Phil Griffin last evening and he told me that they were suspending me,  I expressed to him how I felt about that and accepted it in the spirit in which it was rendered. 
[02:34:00]  Is it a slap in the wrist, Don?  Or do you think it goes a long way to putting this chapter behind you?  Where do you think you stand now?  I don't think it's a slap on the wrist.  I think it's significant.  And I think because I've tried to, and I've been on some PR campaign, by the way,  to try to make up for these repugnant comments I made because I don't have a PR agent.  I'm not represented by Rubenstein.  I apologized to these young women on my program yesterday morning.  And Reverend Al Sharpton asked me to appear on his program,  and I was grateful that he allowed me to do that. 
[02:34:30]  And spent two hours with Reverend Sharpton, who, in spite of his position,  I mean, I thought it was an important dialogue,  and I was grateful that he let me speak to him and his audience and his audience called.  And I think it surprised Reverend Sharpton that a number of people in his audience supported me.  What do they expect from Imus?  How much more can try can a guy be?  The fucking black community, take out your anger on the people that deserve it.  Not some guy that made a stupid remark. 
[02:35:00]  God Almighty, focus the anger.  All right, you were annoyed at this guy.  He couldn't be more contrite.  Let it go.  Be mad at people who are really the problem.  Focus your anger on the drug dealers that are gunning down innocent children in playgrounds during gang wars  or walking up to bodega owners and blowing their faces off for $20 and shooting each other.  Or the Jews.  Right.  For controlling the weather.  No. 
[02:35:30]  Shame on you.  Oh, my God.  But I mean, all this stuff is pouring in on him.  And I didn't mean pouring.  Get the umbrella out.  It's pouring tomorrow.  No, no.  Stop with the umbrella.  I am obsessed with Fat Boy and his umbrella.  No more umbrella.  Fat umbrella.  I bet he has a good one.  He probably holds, no matter how big his umbrella is, his belt still gets wet.  He's trying to hold it.  It's still just his belt. 
[02:36:00]  Couldn't stop eating, could you?  Just couldn't stop shoveling it in.  Fatty.  All right.  This is what is amazing.  Matt brings up another comment that Don Imus made.  Ready?  Yeah.  You want to guess how long ago?  Eight months.  Eight months.  Has to be.  That's good.  That's good.  Could be more than that, Jim.  I'm saying this is probably an eight-year-old clip.  Oh, that's very good, too, Anthony.  No?  No, it's something he said 20 years ago.  Holy shit.  Fucking, what about Hymeetown? 
[02:36:30]  Huh?  20 years ago.  What about fucking Jesse Jackson saying Hymeetown ago?  Was it 87?  That would be 87, Jimmy.  Wow.  What about Reverend Al with the Tarawana Brawley debacle?  Things were different 20 years ago, first of all.  They certainly were.  Can we get the fucking clip of a sharp and sane white interlopers about the people that  were in Harlem with a store and the store was burned down?  No.  That would make him look bad.  Thank you, Kenny.  That would make him look bad, Jimmy.  We can't do that.  You're right.  My apologies.  Yep.  Here it is.  Matt brings up another comment that was made 20 years ago. 
[02:37:00]  This isn't the first time that racially insensitive comments have been made by you  or members of your staff.  There was an incident with Gwen Ifill, a highly regarded.  He has to go back 20 years.  20 years to find a big incident.  You know what?  Listen, I miss from time to time.  You go back maybe a week or two.  A week?  I mean...  He probably said something bad.  You're not really making your point if you're going back 20 years.  Who's Glenn Ifill?  I don't even know.  I think fucking the guy does one tower.  Maybe a tower.  Uh-huh. 
[02:37:30]  Fucker.  I know.  Got me.  I know.  No, no, no.  He has a tower and maybe a Corporal Kurtz will sit in this.  Corporal Kurtz.  Fucking back-hitted shitbag.  You were almost there.  Make the O-Tag.  It's going to be out there.  Fuck me.  Who cares?  What a bust that'll be.  An hour of mediocrity, I should call it.  Nah, muggy face.  Celebrity story.  We get it.  That's who I'm going to have a funny story for.  Hopefully the Grim Reaper. 
[02:38:00]  Wow.  I love it.  He's getting down on himself.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little camper.  Let's learn about this Eiffel guy.  There was an incident with Gwen Eiffel, a highly regarded African-American journalist  who was referred to as a cleaning lady.  We heard about...  Well, no, no, no, no, you're not going to do that to me.  You are not going to cite that, Mark, and not give me an opportunity to respond to that.  I will give you an opportunity in a second, but there have been other apologies in the  past, and there have been pledges taken by you in the past to curb your behavior, and 
[02:38:30]  yet here we are, different year, same problem.  Okay.  What the fuck is Matt Lauer scared of?  He's a balding liberal.  What do you expect from Matt Lauer?  He has to go back 20 years.  Are you...  20 fucking years.  What did he call her?  A cleaning woman.  Cleaning woman?  Big deal.  Remember Bob Grant?  Yes.  We were called Dinkins?  The washroom attendant posing as the mayor.  I love stuff like that. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, is he great.  20 years ago.  Bob Grant.  Try to hang the Gwen Eiffel thing on him, which I discussed with Reverend Sharpton yesterday.  That happened back during the Reagan administration, and it was a...  This is a comedy show.  I'm not a newsman.  This is not meet the press.  Anything we say is not an excuse, but context is important.  There's a difference between premeditated murder and the gun going off accidentally.  I mean, somebody still gets shot, but the charges are dramatically different. 
[02:39:30]  I never said anything about Gwen Eiffel.  This was a comedy routine called, where we make up the news, which we've been doing since 1968 on the radio.  Jesus, God bless you.  Good for him to have an answer.  How fucking old are you?  Jesus Christ.  How about that Woodstock?  Wow, that's something.  Bunch of hippies.  Speaking of nappy.  Don't eat the, well, I don't want to say the color, acid.  Don't eat the acid.  That's my idea.  Don't eat the nappy acid. 
[02:40:00]  Stay off the towers.  By the way, when I do...  I can't even do the, you put a man on the moon and we can't do this joke yet.  Still got a year to go.  It's only 68.  Come on, it's a moon landing joke.  Fuck.  No, no.  Well, you know what side he avoids on the moon?  I'm just a racist.  What's the weather like on the moon?  There's no oxygen here yet.  I'm holding an umbrella, but I'm floating away.  You fucking, you fat tap dancer. 
[02:40:30]  Rob from Long Island is going to challenge me.  Any blacks out there?  All right, good.  Jimmy, how far did you go back with a dancing reference to Whoopi?  See, he's going to challenge you.  Oh, the Ted dancing?  Yeah.  How many years did you go back?  I'll tell you what the difference is.  Whoopi is kind of coming out.  Whoopi is kind of coming out.  And she's been in this position before where she was attacked falsely.  That's what I meant.  And I actually didn't know how many years ago it was.  Oh, okay.  No problem.  I know you guys are up in the white broadcaster's bandstand, waving the flag against Al on the  other side. 
[02:41:00]  Yes.  I just want to know, what did Imus exactly say and how did he mean?  And I'm missing the whole beginning of this.  Are you serious?  Could you explain that?  Imus said...  Are you kidding?  Imus said that blacks are basically, should be slaves.  And then he elbowed somebody's ribs.  And there was a bunch of white people that clapped and went, we hear you, Mr. Imus.  And then all of a sudden people are taking that out of context.  People are mad.  And then they went to commercial.  Yeah.  Okay, that explains it all.  Guys.  Live your show.  Thanks, man.  Absolutely live your show.  Thanks, dude. 
[02:41:30]  But you don't live the show, because we played that clip a bunch of times.  No, you're kidding.  He shit on the Emancipation Proclamation.  That's right.  And wiped his ass with it.  And then he looked at a picture of Abe Lincoln, and he spit on it.  And he went, thanks for nothing, meddler.  I love you guys.  Have a great time.  All right, bye.  Very good.  And he had like a black statue.  He was just whipping and insulting.  It was like, that's a little much, Don.  Dude, it was all in fun.  You can be infuriated by the end of this Today Show interview.  By the end.  Well, the next one is, Matt asked how Imus can be trusted in the future.  Ew.  Exactly. 
[02:42:00]  Fuck you, Matt.  Are we all fucking five years old?  Fuck you and your bad marriage.  Trusted?  You shouldn't even be trusted in your own marriage.  Oh, what a tool he is.  He's not a rapist.  How can we trust you?  They are not coming after Joel Rifkin as hard.  Joel Rifkin, who, let's be honest, little Lisa was very poorly behaved.  Jesus, they're not giving this guy as hard a time.  Hey, for Rob on Long Island, this is what Imus said. 
[02:42:30]  It's a montage.  Evening.  Montage!  Joel Steinberg, by the way.  Yeah.  What did I say?  Joel Rifkin.  The guy that murdered the hookers.  I like both of their work.  It's like confusing Spielberg and Kubrick.  Who hasn't done that?  Both geniuses in their own right.  Absolutely. 
[02:43:00]  Al Roker's a fat pig.  All right, here's...  I hope his stomach blows up.  I hope he coughs and his little stomach bursts and he shits fucking green liquid into his trousers.  All right.  As long as you didn't mention the umbrella, that's okay.  No, why would I?  All right.  Why would I?  I'm just a spoon full of sugar.  No, sellout.  Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.  Hey, what?  If I eat more than two beans, I get a little nauseous.  I don't know why he's suddenly British. 
[02:43:30]  One good thing is that Anna Nicole Smith's story goes away, finally.  I know.  It's all about us.  Who?  Exactly.  Here's the montage of what Imus said.  Mickey!  That's a nappy-headed hoes there.  A nappy-headed ho.  Nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  Some nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho. 
[02:44:00]  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  A nappy-headed ho.  Boner-nosed, beanie-wearing Jew boy.  i need that clip in my system by tomorrow that's the greatest wow do you see how the news people  are using this because they love saying it yeah they can't get away with nigger but this one they  can get away with and they love the naughtiness of it they love that they could say it nappy  headed hoes nappy headed hoes nappy headed hoes nappy headed hoes nappy headed hoes new by rumco

[02:45:30]  you didn't immediately understand how deplorable the comments were of last week how can you be  trusted to clean up your own act or censor yourself is there something wrong with us seriously yes i just  don't see it that way on any level not even coming close to seeing close right their point on this it's a  chance for people to be self-righteous people love to be heard and they love to be self-righteous  and i like matt lauer even though i don't agree with him on this i do like him because i like the 
[02:46:00]  way he fucking went after tom cruise like he's at least honest with his opinions he's being glib  yeah he's just a cunt but then i do like but there's not a cell in my body that agrees with what  he just said not not even they want to do this so that black people can look at them and go wow man  that is cool look see this guy's sticking up he's on our side it's also a chance to influence something  people want to be a part of influencing something um they want to change something and to feel like 
[02:46:30]  you were in on it and part of imus getting booted means you the fact that people are offended by this  is just it's phony i don't believe it except for the team and their families all right i can i can  i can i can dig that that's on a personal level yeah well that's coming up at 11 why am i not  offended by things black comics say i just don't get it i did i i got i may get outraged but not to  the point how about those white people to stop saying when they when they do the white voice like  this and go hey darling we're going to the store and then they do their white impression dude the way 
[02:47:00]  fucking paul moody oh you white motherfucker i'm never never would not want him to be able to say  that well i guess uh they're just weaker all right they can't take it or the leaders can't take it and  they're telling their people that uh they're weaker it's white people too this is a fucking phony  matt lauer yeah i mean even if he's being real maybe but it's like no this is that groveling  just goody two-shoes how could you be expected to clean up your act shut up well thank god al roker  put out a statement of course god alice didn't even have to fucking clean up his plate other than 
[02:47:30]  licking it al roker is never thanks and mike's out there must be busted can someone get me  sorry that was up to par oh eat it motherfuckers oh no  yes did um someone get me al roker's statement he made after the oj verdict could someone find me  al roker's tape oh that's right there isn't one no he was too busy cheering i have never heard al

[02:49:00]  how deplorable the comments were of last week how can you be trusted to clean up your own act or  censor yourself down the road in the future well perhaps i can't then i but we'll have to over  a 35 year uh career uh and i've kept my word to millions of people i've raised over a hundred  million dollars for various things i kept my word on this uh on this marvelous facility we have out  in nexica which is a cattle ranch for kids with cancer and various blood disorders and so on 
[02:49:30]  so uh i've kept my words to the soldiers of this country and to everyone else i have i have a history  of keeping my word i what i did is made a stupid idiotic mistake you know in a comedy context i didn't  open the microphone and say this is what i think of these rutgers women let me put it this way i  should be excused for the remark absolutely not how can you be this shows you that apologizing is  bullshit yep how can you be more on point with what you're saying uh more honest about what you're 
[02:50:00]  saying and these motherfuckers will don't want to let them go they will not let it go that's why  you're right apologizing doesn't fucking help well now we get to hear if you want to apologize do it  once on your show like you did and then don't acknowledge it and and the people get angry  they do fuck them they'll go away they'll fucking go away because it's a fucking it's a piranha  mentality yep piranha mentality you didn't do anything wrong michael richards had to apologize 
[02:50:30]  because he said nigger to people he said it to people he said out of anger and even his apology  he was horrid and it was out of anger and there's a lot of hate behind that yeah but but i miss come  on police all right sharpton is he was only joking here's sharpton uh from this morning says suspension  not a good enough of course of course it does reverend sharpen good morning to you good morning  what do you think of the punishment i think it is not uh nearly enough i think it's a little too  too little too late i think the fact of the matter is that the gravity of this kind of use of the 
[02:51:00]  airways must be stopped you're talking about a show that leading political figures presidential  candidates news anchors go on these young women uh have excelled academically they'd yet rutgers  university being called now is that exactly an anomaly a black girls accelerating at basketball  come on stop it stop it it's a sport they're throwing a ball through a fucking hole 
[02:51:30]  you're no sports are that important you actually they all got together and and fucking cured cured  disease yeah i miss had been raising money for diseases for sick kids and he's like wow these  young women accomplished something no they didn't good for them they're great ball players that'll  help you that'll help society no one gives a fuck i miss is actually helping sick children  and they're fucking ragging them because women who put a ball in a hoop uh were offended they've 
[02:52:00]  accomplished something uh yes they threw a ball in a hole better than other people threw a ball in a  hole yeah you asshole you  uh have excelled academically then rutgers university being called nappy head hoes what precedent are we  setting now that you can apologize every 10 years when you go over the line 10 years imagine only  making a mistake 10 years i think that this is something that is unhealthy for everyone in america 
[02:52:30]  and he should be fighting can this fucking idiot imus attack sharkkin for his record please  why are you not attacking his record al charlatan he used to call him bob grant the reverend al  charlatan once again in the news you're also a minister and in in that role you preach the  teachings of the bible and one of the teachings of the bible is forgiveness how does forgiveness  apply to don imus i think that forgiveness is in order i think that if he meets with those young 
[02:53:00]  ladies and they want to forgive him that is their moral choice to do and maybe the right  thing to do a man stand for me once for leading a march that he disagreed with a man of another  race i went to jail and met with him instead i forgave him but i didn't say he shouldn't do time for  what he did we're talking now about penalty we didn't forgive him for missing but can he be forgiven  he's unemployed they're coming for us next i couldn't even swallow my food together oh yeah god damn 
[02:53:30]  mouthful on that one i have a picture with that guy he's a fan yep he came to the signing that we did  and we all treated him like it was a celebrity royalty we love him and bernie getz we are racist what  dirt bags we are oh my god we all met that guy he rules talking about forgiveness okay but can  he be forgiven if he's unemployed no he must serve the penalty that is commensurate with what he did 
[02:54:00]  and you're saying that is firing and he can be as you use the term two uh uh not necessarily  exclusive of each other serving the penalty does not mean he's not forgiving the penalty of saying you  can no longer continue to abuse the airways since you have a record does not mean you're not forgiven  it means that you have put yourself in a position where this punishment is measured by what you did  god they should fire him and then hire him back on monday oh that would be hysterical imagine hey we 
[02:54:30]  fired him all right and he's back and he's back what what what reverend al why isn't anyone bringing up  his fucking record of of of bullshit and and the tawana brawley why doesn't anyone bring up tawana  brawley they're bringing up 20 year old fucking instances that imis uh uh said on the air bring  up tawana brawley well how about the footage of him in that hotel room doing that dirty shit whatever 
[02:55:00]  it was that weird weird transaction uh or how about again i keep mentioning that white interlopers clip  how about all of that shit he has been involved with all of the stupid things he has said and when  he said why didn't you contradict bernard uh bernie for saying that did he ever contradict farrakhan  i want one instance where sharpton contradicted a black guy while he was talking he said hey that's  a little too racially charged you fucking phony let me bring don imus back in on this don first of  all you said you're going to meet you would like to meet with the rutgers university players what 
[02:55:30]  exactly would you say to them well we've made extraordinary efforts both uh... uh...  all over over the air and and and and officially through members of the uh... religious community  in new jersey and uh... the academic community at rutgers and through uh... privately through people  who know people who uh... who are trying to uh... to to see if these young women will allow me to come  out and apologize to them and i am going to apologize to them and uh... ask them for their 
[02:56:00]  forgiveness i don't expect that and i don't think they have any obligation to either forgive me or to uh...  accept my apology but i uh... have a responsibility to uh... and i think it's important and uh...  everybody can say that context is not important but uh... in every aspect of our lives it is and i want  these young women to know that i didn't say this out of anger and that i didn't say this out of meanness  and i didn't this well i didn't turn my microphone on and say this is what i think of the young women 
[02:56:30]  the rutgers and believe me i know  that that phrase didn't originate in the white community that phrase originated in the black  community and i i'm not stupid uh... i may be a white man but i know  that these young women and young black women and all through that society  are demeaned and disparaged and disrespected by that by their own black men and that they are called  that name and i know that the and that that doesn't give me obviously any right to say it  but it doesn't give them any right to say it 
[02:57:00]  there you go what is he saying that's wrong  how is anybody siding against the guy after he's willing to go everywhere and talk  yeah oh look at this they're very solemn of course they are the rutgers is this the rutgers is  this the uh... their uh... little press conference rutgers reaction live  11 a.m msnbc at least they're being loyal to imus  fucking douches it's all imus all day  i know oh they'll they'll ride uh the ratings of this story and then possibly just say all right  so long i'm gonna love to see uh imus's little uh monthly i bet he gets a nice little pop 
[02:57:30]  in the ratings if he still has a job you know go to cnn.com and go to the videos under entertainment  the one titled imus sorry but won't resign some black guy calls you guys grown folks  acting like a 12 year old fair enough okay try to find out what finally an accurate  fucking statement from one of these guys oh acting like i thought you said fucking 
[02:58:00]  imus explains to matt that he invited sharpton on his show and he said no  well we made it well let me just say we kind of agreed here that we wouldn't make this a debate back  and forth down but you would you would you mind if i allowed reverend sharpton to comment on that  because i talked to reverend sharpton yesterday for two hours matt and i told uh... phil griffin  and uh... everybody else i didn't intend so i invited reverend sharpton to appear on my program  and uh... he didn't have the courage that i had no i thought that i'm not talking about  i'm not trying to do i want to know i'm talking about you know i'm walking and i walked in his 
[02:58:30]  studio yesterday and there were hundreds of people there and my hands weren't shaken and uh... i  didn't get up and run out of the studio uh... every five minutes when the mic's went off i  sat there and i talked to reverend hargus like a man uh... reverend uh... shopping like a man  and he uh... and he did not he say reverend hargus did he say reverend hargus that's his old  that's his old bit reverend bill is all hargus berber baby yeah praise jesus he said i  spoke to reverend hargus he's losing his fucking mind wouldn't you with this 
[02:59:00]  spot he said before i miss he hasn't slept i'm sure god damn i i spoke with mobi worm  uh... when i went in there yeah it was uh... coming down the road to your high school  reverend hargus  hey can we play our al roker bit going into break  when we saw him at the sushi joint i love that bit oh is that  fucking too much he said hargus let me see if he's finally getting angry yep good  yeah let me see if i can find that part again uh... every five minutes when the mic's went off i 
[02:59:30]  sat there and i talked to reverend hargus like a man uh... reverend uh... shopping like a man  and he uh... and he did not keep his word i asked him to appear on my program he said he  didn't want to appear to the scene of the crime so i happen to like reverend sharkin and that's  not patronizing he knows that i've been around a long time so uh... and i dealt fairly with him  and he tried to hang a couple things on me and he knew that that wasn't gonna fly but if he  didn't have the same kind of courage that i had i walked in that studio by myself he did too man 
[03:00:00]  well it was an intimidating turn off with him yeah turn off yeah it's almost like by yourself  that's like walking in with a gay men's magazine  look at this these two men fucking in the ass that's my why did i have to elaborate he got it  conjures up a nice image jimmy he's a nice guy but he doesn't like controversy that turn off  isn't that funny he went over to the fan and it was pretty much  i think so we didn't have to deal with the controversy that our show brings over there at cbs 
[03:00:30]  because he was our uh program director yeah and then he went over to the fan where it's nice and  easy and there's no pressure and no controversy and boom he's got to deal with this and  finally this i would say that uh that there's a world of difference between what mel gibson did  and michael richards did and whoever and the guy from grace anatomy we we have to understand that  i'm that i have a record of a of a relationship with the african-american community whether reverend 
[03:01:00]  sharpman likes it or not that i'm i am a good uh and decent person and uh i've been conducting a  comedy show for uh 30 years i can come back and uh and serves it to hopefully serve this to the  suspension with dignity and come back and create a dialogue one of the things that we're going to that  we're going to do that we've been talking about for you if you can don i'm running out of time  there ought to be a black person on this show every single day to add some perspective and  that when we ought to have more black guests and uh and me and the rest of white america ought to 
[03:01:30]  understand what's going on in the black community and i'll make an effort to do that we do why do you  need a black guy every day why you know you don't he's doing anything to save his gig but you don't  need that you know unless he's saying he's saying all that stuff to protect all the guests that he  wants to make sure the guests aren't scared to go on his show look how earl screws up the ron and  fest show you think we need that you think imus needs that absolutely wow it is everywhere man i know  cnn msnbc all doing stories i don't like imus's stupid upturned color 
[03:02:00]  i don't like it shooby-dooby shooby-dooby let's uh  let's uh let's uh take a break jesse jackson talks about imus and uh he thinks the uh the women's  basketball team they need psychoanalysis what oh yeah it's just you know jesse jackson for how  much of a scumbag opportunistic douche fuck uh reverend al is jesse jackson is retarded he is 
[03:02:30]  fucking retarded i can't wait to listen to this drivel how you listen to this guy how the black  community looks at him as a leader when he can't even speak and what it does come out of his mouth  that you can understand is like that of a mongoloid hey uh very good uh shruggy what's up  of course what's going on i was distracted just out of curiosity what is howard's taking all this  obviously i listen to you but i would like to think he's supporting imus even though they hate each  other well uh nobody uh can really hear what howard is saying yeah we have a little audio from uh 
[03:03:00]  howard and for some reason he takes shots at us uh through this whole thing hey guys also real  quickly he's not supporting him though he's not he said he didn't like it because he said he invented  black people hey guys one other thing uh let's assume this was you now i go back way back to you  guys and you guys are talking a good game now but i remember and i'm not throwing stones here but the  day after the sex for sam you guys were muzzled yeah now if you were to do the same to say if you  were guys were to say something along the same lines as um imus said when you have that same muzzle 
[03:03:30]  long dude the difference oh my god hold on i've said in an article since then that i regret that  we didn't uh speak up the day after uh what the sex were saying yeah but i completely here and you  could say what you think you would say and i can i jump in and just say what i think the difference  between the two things is it's a valid question the difference between somebody saying something  that is just a little politically incorrect in a politically correct climate is different  than when you know you've had arrests it's like there was actually like in our mind like 
[03:04:00]  like look look technically something illegal went on or possibly went on  fucking in a church is a little hard to defend there's no way to defend that on the fact of  it's free speech let me use something that was let's use that little bit you did with muhammad  ali and all the jokes that anthony did um impersonating muhammad ali uh-huh that bit right  yes absolutely hilarious bit you know i use those jokes today sir absolutely hilarious let's assume the  wrong person heard that and started the whole firestorm yeah and it grew and it grew 
[03:04:30]  yeah we and you guys are being bombarded by all all the media and you have politicians coming down  on you are you guys going to say it's a joke relax when you have xm management breathing down your  neck i think that's a very valid question of course of course that would be the response from everybody  i'm sure anthony would say that oh but of course not that's your only defense that's how we would  have if we were allowed to speak which a lot of times you're not but if we were allowed to speak yeah i  i would say obviously it's a joke it's in the context of humor and uh it's yeah it's a parody of 
[03:05:00]  my point is though you guys are saying you would be doing this you'd be doing that do you really  think imus has the authority or for lack of a better term to come out and say everybody relax do  you think he has the authority to say what about tawana brawley what about yes i do yes in sharpton  studio he absolutely does he should he should he should bring that up you know what it looks like  though that it would look like to other people that he's trying to distract from the issue if if 
[03:05:30]  if he wasn't so magnanimous the guy is apologizing like no one i've ever seen before he's setting an  apology record the fucking guy i agree with you 100 percent i think this is what they have to do with  the story hold on a second we're watching we're watching our jefferson's upstairs neighbors are on  television i just wish that someone had the balls to come out and do this as an aside when this all  clears up you guys are ready to yuck it up again i gave travis a cheap duck for you guys to listen to  something i think you'll enjoy oh hey all right hey shruggy by the way why don't we agree that um 
[03:06:00]  to disagree open no that oh triple h did indeed wreck wwe later why did shruggy not like the ones  that's that's what i don't know i don't know why he doesn't like me i think you like no he doesn't  i've talked to him really yeah not like how does anyone not like little jimmy jimmy as cute as a  button and he's hilarious hilarious people i can't do the people part yet hilarious people there you go 
[03:06:30]  hey uh al roker making that statement we got a little al roker it's a quick bit as we go to break  correct and uh jesse jackson when we come back and uh wow and more uh audio coming in  chew from philadelphia who gives a fuck about imus oh i don't know pretty much the whole country yeah  um it's the top news story but it's it's not even close they've pretty much blown off everything  including the speeches from bush uh yesterday to turn on any appliance in your house the imus story 
[03:07:00]  comes out of it he writes it's a real bummer you guys devoted pretty much your entire show to this guy  he's he is as old as dirt to this guy and dresses up in a fucking cowboy costume who gives a  fuck about him move on yeah because it's only about imus it's not about the situation racial tensions  uh opportunistic ass bags you're not getting the uh big picture on this one tune away you're not  you're not fucking educated enough to listen to this show and that's a sorry state of affairs 
[03:07:30]  are you kidding we're dummies our phones are lit they've been lit all morning uh pointy hat on in  the corner we've crashed once so far here at xm because too many people are trying to call the show  yes yeah who cares you're right you're right we'll we'll tell dick jokes next oh i'm i had the image  in my head again of uh al roker eating sushi yeah yeah we we had some sushi today before the show  went to lunch had some sushi go to the little sushi place yeah and uh al roker comes walking in

[03:09:00]  play with their food yeah until they just swallow it whole swallow it whole swallow it whole everything  go right down that's what it looked like it looked like when uh when the shark ate quint out of the  boat al was tipping up the big sushi train he's just a little tenderizing  swallow your whole i'm watching al roker eat sushi all of a sudden his eyes roll back white 
[03:09:30]  lifeless eyes like a doll's eyes and then you hear the horrible high-pitched screaming and hollering  damn was that funny man al roker eating sushi today night time comes al roker comes cruising  you hear the horrible high-pitched screaming and they just keep going down and al roker just keeps  pounding and pounding and pounding water turns red with blood al roker comes back

[03:12:30]  is there anything you won't do for ratings we are publicity whore bags publicity sluts we're  artists this is all about money that's what it comes down to but you're mercenaries i mean  aren't you mercenaries we're radio mercenaries dickhead we're artists we're entertainers we're not  psychologists we're not doctors we're not daycare workers we're artists so it's all on the parents  none on you none on us we're artists none on us  came out on the paper today that the police tried to like uh do some new material

[03:13:30]  that have heard the new police ten bucks yeah about ten fifteen dollars a seat sending out an sos  what are they really wait oh let me turn on the bucks let me turn the mic on it oh it is on outside  oh oh that hurt  i just thought the mic wasn't on because i thought it's funny too wait wait wait hold on 
[03:14:00]  you got him back that's what happens when i'm humiliated and pride comes in it pushes the  humiliation out it pushes all that low self-esteem away just don't say umbrella anymore that's all i  think it's umbrella don't don't do it don't you uh we made uh the story cnn uh had a little little 
[03:14:30]  guy on named roland martin i saw him last night on ronan martin roland i thought you were talking  about ronan martin's laughing it's a groovy show love it and he has a rap and this guy this guy  betcher bippy let's talk about the uh fickled finger of fate award you're all laughing things  holy shit gonna run that check again i'm doing 50 year old jokes here 
[03:15:00]  i hated what was his name yeah it's on out there oh which one the guy who did  did jimmy duranti oh what a cunt i had to bite his fat nose alcoholic fucking nose he just sucked  a big risk to take jimmy duranti jokes  roland martin he'll come after you roland martin he has a round head like our own oh he's awful  he really seen him right yeah he should be painted yellow and just be a fucking smiley face he makes 
[03:15:30]  an interesting point here he's a black chicago talk show host well something that's been talked  about a little bit now uh... and you tell me if if a black radio host had said the exact same thing  would the story be the same today would this even be a story today if a black radio host who was like  opium anthony or man cow one of these grown folks acting like a twelve-year-old the answer would be no  but if tom joiner if tom joiner who speaks to eight million people a week who has similar 
[03:16:00]  politicians on his show if he had made such a comment you would indeed see criticism i was is  in a different place tom joiner's show is a 120 stations across the country i must is on 70 stations  but also he's on a cable news network again it's a different standard we're twelve-year-old that's  actually not a bad point though about a cable news network like there's a news angle to it even though  it is on all right okay i at least that's a we're grown men that act like 12 year olds yeah we do 
[03:16:30]  jokes that's all we do that's accurate uh jesse jackson talks to talks about imus i thought they  talked uh to each other i'm not really sure now but uh and then uh hymie town was brought up on the  today's show we got the audio my reaction was is this a new standard for n bc if if uh brian  williams does this or chris matthews does this is to get up again they said refer to women as 
[03:17:00]  holes uh... and get a two-week suspension is this the new standard uh... i think the context of the  statement is not just i must i must add his producer says these are hardcore holes referring  these young women remember them first generation college no damp-headed hoes no they look more like  the toronto raptors the men's basketball team no the memphis missus this was a a depiction of racial  degradation that's very harmful and right now there's more focus on i must his future and these the  impact upon these girls if you will there's no oh impact upon the first of all who could understand 
[03:17:30]  every fucking third word that's about it he's a mush mouthed jizz bucket oh all right we are  sir we've been following the story very closely as a radio show right name one one name from the  rutgers women's basketball team do you know one name do me a favor hit that bell  nine times off one for every member of the team 
[03:18:00]  that boy and he counted nine too jesus what's wrong with you i know no one was counting along  with you they all have the same name  i have decided to be the judge today i'm keeping track of all laughs and bombs  why because i was hoping to get a laugh out of that were you really  it just sounded like you just made your statement that didn't tell you a bad joke that's the problem 
[03:18:30]  with me half of these things are jokes but people think they're a statement just statements  all right jesse thinks these women who are degraded need to be looked at by psychoanalysts oh no  what is the impact of jackson on these players these young women and that's why maybe we should have  some psychoanalysts a psychologist should i say to talk about what does it mean when young women are  degraded the other game from being called inward to beat up to be worth what is it what did he just 
[03:19:00]  say what the fuck did he just say yen word is that was it yeah you're right good call yen word  the yen replay that whole fucking statement because i couldn't even understand the second he started  talking i didn't understand one word jesus why couldn't he be on the balcony that morning looking at  the sunshine what do you want i got to hear that statement i don't know what the fuck he said i 
[03:19:30]  don't want to play it again please no please gh no sugar honey baby no no all right thank you  you're welcome yes you got it what is the impact jackson uh on these players these are really trying  now and that's why maybe we should have some psychoanalysts a psychologist should i say to  talk about what does it mean when young women are degraded the other game from being called inward  to beat up to be worth what is it what is the end the beaver in the dell what there's something 
[03:20:00]  that i have no idea the you know what the union was that n-word because something they  even warm on the b-word the b-word the guy is a marble mouth hey by the way big duties j is good  for one every day imus has a show where a drunk brian wilson stumbles into a weather forecast how is  that a new show all right mm-hmm imus looks hot under the collar right now well that's from uh earlier  that was earlier all right yeah yeah all right again from being called inward to beat up to be worth 
[03:20:30]  what is it what is the impact it's degrading and it's hurtful it may be the first step toward  domestic violence if women can accept the degrading term of being called a hoe that's the next step  toward having a person who are neutralized so it has profound ramifications i submit to you  i submit to you shut up he only knows how to talk in rhyme he wanted to go into rhyme mode it's so  amazing that black people can never just say that's not a big deal no never when is the last time 
[03:21:00]  you heard something like silly like this they just it's not a big deal they're just piling on  because he represents what they don't like he's just an old white guy most of them don't know what  he does yep and jackson doesn't sort of shopped him but most black people really don't listen  i know they just know he's an old white guy who said something inappropriate about blacks let's get  him can't just let it go media saying this could be the first step toward domestic violence so now 
[03:21:30]  well yeah he's in a way blaming what imus said on on women that get beaten it's it's and then the  real point is the reason they're gonna get beaten is not because i am it's because they lost that game  right hold on the jury has spoken  tough ones out there aren't they they are a tough crowd i gotta tell you i think they  want to see tits let's be honest i don't give a shit about this i don't like the 
[03:22:00]  fucking three same coat wearing rapists in the back  why do they all have the same coats on you get we can hear you go ahead why someone yell it out  because he told me to wear it i don't know what's the patch mean what is it yeah what are you guys  hold on dog catchers dog catchers yeah where's he going oh boy he's in connecticut oh in connecticut 
[03:22:30]  oh emt okay oh my god i've stubbed my toe getting out of the beamer  no no we're from 9-1-1 we're emts chris's dog they're so snooty in connecticut catches them and  eats them that they don't uh speaking of eating they don't eat uh they're so snooty in connecticut  they don't eat uh chunky monkey they call it obese primate  oh no i'm not going to let him get away with that 
[03:23:00]  or is it no it's off the wall my mistake you don't get it because they're rich they  obese primate yeah obese primate speaking of which classic tv joke you don't get to see it  uh hey president bush talking about our wreck is spinning oh it's about time they blew off  something else yesterday for this all right here we go uh just talked about whether or not imus is  sincere reverend jackson when you hear don imus apologize he went on al sharpton's radio show 
[03:23:30]  yesterday for two hours and apologized do you believe he's sincere well you know he's apologized  before to uh clarence page so this is repetition i think he's sincere because the thing right now he  has really been uh hurt politically and maybe economically by this but the question is but is  he going to go and get some treatment or just take a two-week break today and tomorrow he'll have eight 
[03:24:00]  more hours to bring all of his friends to kind of create a kind of uh sympathy movement for imus  the more focus on his future than it is on the plight of these and other women in similar situations  i hope that they get some real concern as well what's wrong with that imus gets to fight back on  his show because they didn't take him off the air how about they didn't take him off the air  because he's got a charity to raise money for children where's the hymie town comment oh it's  coming yeah where's that okay oh i'm i'm well organized over here maybe they didn't put on there 
[03:24:30]  down the boys are talking about hammertown when i said the hammertown i was talking about the jew  and then we got uh whoopee uh in case you missed it whoopee you want to hear that i  fucked up whoopity too all right murdith murdith asked jesse about hymie town here it is from the  today show good but people do say stupid things sometimes and on reverend jackson i apologize but  some of your critics reminded me why do you have to apologize you stupid guilty white hole why the

[03:25:30]  a fucking racist anti-semitic uh uh little thing he threw out years ago it goes beyond what i hate  these fucking assholes it's guilt but it is based do you understand that that is the way you talk  to an uh a fucking a cornered animal that you're afraid of yeah that is not the way you have an  intelligent discussion with a guy whose intellect and integrity you respect that is the way you talk  to a wolverine hey i'm sorry i i just like i hate to upset you hey it's that fucking there's no honesty 
[03:26:00]  in that at all talk to a wolverine yes but it was actually when he was uh i forget the guy's name  before he turned into the wolverine oh oh i got you yeah  talking about the x-men i do you're too wordy i do talk about i talk to wolverines all the time  yes too yes i actually did a play called dances with wolverines check out these calves boys  i'm like i miss an n-double-a-c-p don't use props to get laughs what props you're you're you're nice

[03:27:00]  when you go into some ridiculous story from the past and use the person's real name that you're  hanging with do you know it's just something about that that makes it even fun to annoy my ex-girlfriend  uh not from 10 years ago i used to characters and one of them like it's kind of like uncle paul  but the original uncle paul was uncle larry who um who had like a little teeny mouth and he was  a molester and um like one of the kids he molested his name was chet and chet was a character who was  a burn victim and he had his entire body was burned except for his legs below the knees so he always 
[03:27:30]  wore knickers to show off his his unburned skin like he was proud of his unburned calves  oh henry winkler psa from 1984 are you kidding me i thought we did that already maybe tomorrow  okay all right here's uh jamie town can we hear groveler apologize again or apologize for  bringing people do say stupid things sometimes and on reverend jackson i apologize but some of your 
[03:28:00]  critics reminded me of 1984 and i remembered as well can you keep running the president did you hear  again what this phony bitch said yeah not only i apologize some of your critics reminded me not  why did you say that and god forbid i should be thought of as a critic of a black person yeah some  of your critics critics reminded me like those bad people that would criticize you kind of threw this  at me so i got i apologize in phony bitch she couldn't have prefaced this better if she 
[03:28:30]  holy shit blew the guy beforehand reverend jackson i apologize for my my my awful skin and the  guilt of my forefathers but did you insult well fuck you yes some of your critics did you guys how  about uh this is what you did i shouldn't have to apologize for what you fucking did and you're  gonna tell me this bitch didn't remember that you're gonna tell me a news person didn't remember  that i know pick up your uh worksheets all i want to say is uh didn't yeah i i have i don't know 
[03:29:00]  if i have the same thing you do but i do think that sigourney weaver did a movie with some of these  gals oh my god wow holy mother of christ that's holy crap you ugly son of a bitch  this is the worst looking group of women i've ever seen whoa look at page two horrible look at the 
[03:29:30]  first one on page two oh they're awful is that a beard no i'm not even kidding look under and then  what is that what what is this this right here look at that one um looks like wesley snipes no i  no don't don't i swear doesn't this girl look like al roker with a wig the one chick looks like 
[03:30:00]  fucking al roker that's al oh she awful all right the one isn't bad maya mccurdy's okay yeah she  really yeah she was not bad i don't know oh my god i i did this the top of page two is like  like earl douglas falling asleep no you know she looks like she looks like  fucking edie ameen i don't know why when it bombs once i tried edie again sometimes you gotta bring  it back wow uh here here here let's get through this so uh meredith again we're trying to get it's 
[03:30:30]  just two quick clips here and then you referred to new york city as hymy town and you were raked  over the coals for that a lot of people said you're anti-semitic gentleman and it took you several  days to apologize and then you begged for forgiveness so what's the difference between that and this  is well if it is repetitions and if it's a pattern that is one question but the broader context here 
[03:31:00]  i must say is that one week is chicago cotton being sent to jeff for seven years to pushing a hall  monitor to come on the march madness and all the blacks on the basketball court ucla have 132 freshmen  admitted last year and the and the final four twenty six thousand freshmen in those four schools two  two thousand were black uh last year that more young black men in jail than college in every  state that's a context this in substance this fall kids say dry field we'll go to school and don't 
[03:31:30]  fucking commit crimes to racial justice did he address that and generally quality and fairness is  really the bigger picture here did i miss the did i miss where he addressed hymy town  and did you call him on it and say you didn't answer the question i'm i'm really sorry i took two  seconds to read something and he was going off on why he basically said uh it was a one-time thing  but he didn't say that he goes well if this is about a pattern of behavioral right uh a pal because  i miss has a power of behavioral this is a guy who's a presidential candidate who slammed new york 
[03:32:00]  saying it's all jews hymy presidential candidate took him a week to apologize and she nailed that  motherfucker despite the fact that she is a groveling twat maybe she groveled because she knew she was  about to level him uh but uh you know can we hear that again yeah please i gotta hear that and pay  attention listen to this fucking this is this is the fucking leader of the black community yeah but  people do say stupid things sometimes and on reverend jackson i apologize but some of your  critics reminded me of nineteen eighty four and i remembered as well you were running for president 
[03:32:30]  and you referred to new york city as hymy town and you were raked over the coals for that a lot of  people said you're anti-semitic gentlemen and it took you several days to apologize and then you beg  for forgiveness so what's the difference between that and this well if it is repetitions and if  it's a pattern that is one question but the broader context here i must say is that one week is should  come the cotton being sent to jeff for seven years to push him a whole monitor they come out of a march 
[03:33:00]  madness and all the blacks on the basketball court ucl they have a hundred or two freshmen admitted last  year and the and the final four twenty six thousand freshmen in those four schools two thousand were  black uh last year that more young black men in jail than college in every state that's a context  this in substance this far kids say dry field that's why michelle's point about a broader commitment to  racial justice and generally quality and fairness is really the bigger picture here 
[03:33:30]  holy fucking you you just it's so hard that's fucking phony did you see the way he sidestepped  that question sidestepped the entire fucking question what about hymy town what about a week  to apologize what about groveling uh and and how is that any different than imus's situation and he  just didn't even fucking address can we get jesse jackson audio of him apologizing for that i know it's  out there i would love to hit that tomorrow uh and today uh because these are the guys that are 
[03:34:00]  attacking imus and the way he just it's a pattern of behavior you dude maybe so maybe he has a pattern  and you didn't but here's the difference he's doing a comedy show he's doing a comedy show jesse  jackson was a viable presidential candidate dude he was a he was running yeah for the highest office  in this country and getting home town wow and then uh this from meredith the last clip from her 
[03:34:30]  just wanted to clarify for a minute because uh reverend you thought that nobody works with imus is  is african-american but his executive producer is so it's not on msnbc well no well his point was on  on the shows that from now from now on he's going to have a broader variety of black guests he's going to  have a broader point of view but between mcgrick and it's i mean it's not just imus rosenberg and  mcgrick it is a team of this kind of of offensive language over a long period of time he apologized 
[03:35:00]  before to uh columnist clarence pace so he's mad he's not recycling his apology over a long period of  time where was he when uh he you know imus might have said something bad about another group yeah but  even though again that pattern there is part of a comedy show jesse jackson is a serious spokesman and  he sidestepped that fucking coward sidestepped that question and then tried to uh get her mind off of 
[03:35:30]  it by talking about uh more blacks are uh you know in jail than in college and she didn't uh she didn't  address it she should have hit him again i understand that reverend jackson but explain to me as a viable  presidential candidate how did that why am i pretending on her how about going to fucking uh  finishing school uh and then going to college instead of um not finishing school and uh selling  drugs or uh shooting each other that might get more of you into college than in prison 
[03:36:00]  what the fuck kind of excuse is that i'm sick of it i'm so fucking sick of it disgusted  uh disgusted sure you asked what howard had to say this is pretty much all he had to say  as this involved me you can see how gutless and desperate uh media companies are now i mean  i when imus is your only asset you can't afford to lose i don't want to go into like crowing and 
[03:36:30]  tooting my own you know i've kind of avoided that but like opie and anthony in las vegas just had a  0.0 rating okay i'm only telling you this thank you save the situation i'm only telling you this to  make and he also has a 0.0 in vegas and a 0.0 in new york and philly and boston and washington  because he's not on the radio right exactly but why would he like attack imus and say corporates 
[03:37:00]  is the reason he's staying on when he knows better corporate is the reason he might get booted yeah  and uh you know corporate did the same thing for him back in the day from time to time  i'm only telling you this to make a point they had a you you cannot david i've never heard of a  rating like it's almost impossible to have a 0.0 it's probably a first in radio it's what um  blutarski's grade point average wasn't i get that joke already zero point the only other time i've 
[03:37:30]  ever heard that was as a joke zero point zero but getting getting back to my that's not a bit  it's not one person listening yeah i've heard of 0.1 and you never get 0.0 see he's crowing he found  the one market we suck in now and he's crowing and what did the station change or something yeah i  don't know to be something i don't even know it's it's too early to tell i mean he's crowing the  reality is with uh without our regular radio stations we're talking to more people than howard 
[03:38:00]  right at this very moment yeah and then you add on the 25 radio stations we get to talk to  from uh six to nine every morning he's fucking beyond jealous so he's finding the one place that  we truly suck yeah and he's gonna you know yeah he's gonna crow go ahead crow exploit us and if we  suck so bad why did uh cbs uh uh keep us they could get rid of us any day they want any day they  could they could fire us tomorrow they haven't though any other personality would be fired yeah for his 
[03:38:30]  comments but the fact of the matter is nobody listens to imus this might be the first interesting  thing he's ever said the only time i would be behind now sharpen right take his job yeah oh  yeah but anyway so it just shows you though media companies like msnbc puts his television you know  blake makes a television show of his radio show i wonder where they got that idea um but from you 
[03:39:00]  howard of course you're desperate for it you invented fucking everything god damn is there one  fucking clip that we've ever played where he hasn't taken credit for something holy  shit yeah i wonder where he got that idea i don't know from the box that shows pictures on it the  television set did you invent the tv what a psychopath the guy's a lunatic wonder where he got that idea  putting something on the television set you know they're desperate for ratings and they stayed away 
[03:39:30]  from it they're totally like hey look yeah yeah they're pretending that they don't know anything  about it they're going well cbs uh they're in charge of cbs radio is in charge of the show we  have nothing to do with it no it's on your air you can't say you're not in charge of it all of a  sudden they don't know what to do yeah they don't know what to do somebody punish him jesus  somebody punish him why are they for like imus getting punished because they can't see past  themselves they can't see the big picture why this is really bad for everybody 
[03:40:00]  and then this is uh beyond disappointing this next clip well the fact of the matter is that  he won't be punished when i told you that the the saviors of morning radio have a 0.0 in fact  a radio consultant called me i would never even know about this this is looking good against you  don't know about this stuff you're following it very closely this guy's the biggest  fucking phony goal another load of shit it's always somebody else happens to bump into him 
[03:40:30]  in the hall to tell him something that that he he found out himself and why don't you  fucking talk about our uh boston numbers or our buffalo numbers or our new york numbers or any like  what wait you know oh they the saviors of radio have a 0.0 like we're in one fucking market  boston was very good we just had a great meeting with joel hollander he's uh he's beyond  psyched and said uh the people above him are beyond psyched uh with the results they know  it's a slow build and uh like and said we're doing just fine in new york just fine in philly just fine 
[03:41:00]  in boston just fine in washington just fine in buffalo and believe it or not just fine in chicago  even that's uh even though that's still early on uh tim sabian who used to be a friend of the show  uh this is going to be beyond disappointing when you hear this clip he has to help uh fucking howard out  here and he says that we had a 0.0 in chicago which is not true we took over for rover what is  0.0 who had a 0.0 which is which is a horrendous place to start and since then uh we've done quite  well yeah we're building it up it started at a 0.0 nothing to brag about but it's it's way past the 
[03:41:30]  0.0 at this point yeah but nothing uh to the point where they're going to start writing about it but our  cume is uh pushing a hundred thousand in chicago and trust me that's that's nothing to brag about but  it's still a hundred thousand people were broadcasting to in chicago where there were none when we stepped in  that howard doesn't broadcast to yeah it was a 0.0 when we stepped in it's gone up since then it's  like wait what the fuck they don't have the fact the cume's just under a hundred thousand and who 
[03:42:00]  gives them that little tidbit of information tim sabian douchebag something called me i would  never even know about this this is looking good against the 0.0 which is unbelievable in two markets  they had a 0.0 too much tim do you know man so what i'm saying is the company is so desperate for  people uh they lost hundreds of millions of dollars when i left yeah that imus will survive this yeah 
[03:42:30]  jesse jackson once again it's all your fault oh shut up yeah it's my fault because if i was there  they'd have enough money to you know they could get rid of him shut up but how in the world do you pull a  zero point zero but where what was the other market with a zero point zero uh chicago was  zero point zero right there's nothing there vegas is zero point in vegas uh and then they're flat  everywhere else i know i mean there's like nothing but my point everywhere else i'm not sitting  putting the guys down they're in a tough position okay what i'm being a gentleman the fact the position  are they in i don't know none there's no competition i don't know i don't know i just so don't 
[03:43:00]  want to robin i just so don't want to be um this isn't about you you don't want to make it about  you i'm making it about the the corporate environment that allows imus to stay on the air  imus he's a lucky man is a lucky lucky man  exactly tim sabian can suck a fucking hairy man  asshole so you've fucking accepted howard's dick in your mouth hey tim  all the things you used to say to us over at ysp you finally decided to 
[03:43:30]  fucking pull down how he's fly pull his cock out and suck it  ugh everyone that goes over there drinks the kool-aid  even tim who was supposed to be our friend his stupid tight slacks his dopey tight slacks  that seam going up his ass as he's taking us on a tour of where ben franklin's house used to be  way to get my cock moving sorry jim 
[03:44:00]  what an ass  oh  fuck off real fucking brave that was tim's uh cell number what a douchebag what a  fucking douchebag this business stinks everywhere else flat really that's not true take a look  ass that's not true dc was good dc was fine dallas was up again good absolutely the books that are 
[03:44:30]  gonna come out at the end of the month you decide boston was great come on shut the fuck up but see  this is what drives my brother nuts because he goes these radio guys you know they could say whatever  they want and there's no there's no accountability they're all phony they could just say whatever the  fuck they want tim sabian what a douchebag that's right no one heard it it was on  fucking howard's show he's preaching to the converted anyway sorry to bum out the studio audience look at 
[03:45:00]  them i don't know i think my eighth edmin joke did the job i liked it and then we got an email  coming in what a day man from dave the uh program director of wbcn forward an email about whoopie  goldberg you guys are unbelievably rude disrespectful immature and unprofessional i was listening to your  conversation if you could call it that with whoopie goldberg a few minutes ago i was surprised that 
[03:45:30]  she didn't hang up sooner than she did you were rudely talking over her over her you talk about  al sharpton enjoying the limelight i guess it takes one to know one you guys are obnoxious i'm sure  that you are pleased with yourselves and actually think that this email is a compliment shame on you  how old are you anyways well and then she writes i remember when bcn was a great radio station what  happened debbie s well i think she thought it was a great station until today right way back yeah  until we got under her skin i guess so is debbie s's email address huh we never yes debbie shithead 
[03:46:00]  yeah debbie suck a baby cock and then die and now that you know it's a tough audience when suck a  baby cock and then die gets a two a titter you want to hear the whoopie thing real fast before you leave  sure yeah so just don't be rude we decided we need to talk to whoopie because uh she she said uh  what'd she say in the paper today i'm we're tired that uh i'm she said that basically it was very  offensive and you should be fired and the people are sick of it and we were pretty surprised uh  uh that coming from her yeah coming from a comedian what he said was not uh illegal what he said was 
[03:46:30]  not uh i think definable but it was wrong it was morally wrong all right so you say it's wrong  should he be fired for that do i think he should be fired he should be fired as much as print lot  was fired as much as jimmy the greek was fired well you're insane i'm not a comedian jimmy the greek  wasn't a comedian when he said what he said the bottom line is i can't hear you when you when you  look at something like like cheryl underwood look at the type of materials she does and the thing she 
[03:47:00]  goes after why is it i don't know who you're talking about cheryl underwood she's a black uh  female comic and uh she goes after race pretty harsh she drops n-bombs have a radio doesn't matter  we're talking about the right no no i'm answering i don't know why should radio show hosts that do  a comedy show be held to higher standards okay as like network news are you crazy listen we should  we should be able to say whatever the hell we want when we do our program excuse me god bless you 
[03:47:30]  now i'm willing to listen to you but you know what if you're going to talk over me i don't know  who cheryl norton is so i can't comment on what she does no cheryl underwood not cheryl  norton cheryl underwood you're norton yes oh please hey what about uh ted dancing i don't want  to comment on her because i don't know what the conversation with whoopee what about the ted  dancing is i mean you guys caught you were making a racial point no no but i'm saying oh oh come on  hang up hang up i just stopped it because a lot of people trying to defend whoopee like uh on the 
[03:48:00]  way over here and then the instant feedback and email saying that she hung up because she couldn't  hear us no she said oh come on she even said oh come on like she goes oh it was clear as day you  said how about the ted dancing incident and she went oh come on hang up i'm like you guys it was  so not a conflict it was like you guys we got a fire you know what i was gonna say yeah it was  really i was shocked that she hung up i figured she'd have some kind of an answer that separated  her from imus prepared or whatever because she had to know she's gonna be asked about it yeah i mean  when you've been in this situation and you're running your mouth about almost the same thing a 
[03:48:30]  racial conflict come on don't be self-righteous you got to uh definitely look back at what you've done  and make sure you're prepared uh because they're gonna ask you about it like jesse they're gonna  ask him about heinie town that's like me he obviously was prepared by saying yeah that's  like me railing against prostitution yeah trashing guys who pick up hookers and saying it's disgusting  and and not killing them hold on hold it no no i don't need it that was actually um hold it  let it sink in let me enjoy 
[03:49:00]  and we did talk to whoopie on the phone in the office she called for hope i i do like whoopie  because even though i don't agree with her on this one i don't think she she's certainly not a  pussy i mean she will pick up the phone and call you i mean she didn't want to answer that question  but she called us i mean i do like her but uh on in the uh office of course uh we asked about ted  dancing and she said uh topi oh 
[03:49:30]  he must be making excuses  a little bit  tim why did you why did you suck howard's cock yesterday when he was talking about the ratings 
[03:50:00]  he asked me a question i told him a question do it do it wait wait wait do we have a 0.0 in chicago  what do you have it's way more than a 0.0 but you had to agree with howard why we came in at a 0.0  we came in we came in uh with a 0.0 when rover was there he called you in and you and you sat there  and kissed his ass what the fuck is that about when he asked me a question he goes what other  station has not got ratings and i tell them the fact tell him you don't fucking know we did we used 
[03:50:30]  to have a relationship what the fuck's wrong with you you have to suck his cock now that you worked for  him dude you know damn well we don't have a 0.0 in chicago you flat out lied to to help his  fucking point it's bullshit have you been following the ratings in chicago have you seen that the cume  is up every month for the last four months in a row we're just under a hundred thousand in cume  which is nothing to brag about but it's way better than when we've uh first started there 
[03:51:00]  i don't know what the overall station is it's still in the toilet but it's getting better every  fucking month look i understand you work for him and you work for the competition but you don't  have to sit there and suck his cock with misinformation we used to be fucking friends  what's your fucking deal man and then you're saying we're flat everywhere else is that true  tell me that's true tim you don't follow the fucking ratings you've seen that we went up the  last two months in new york you've seen that we have gone up in chicago you saw the last trend in boston 
[03:51:30]  i know you dude we used to hang out you follow radio like the back of your hand the  fucking trend in boston was way the fuck up did you see the buffalo fucking numbers you said flat across  the board so why couldn't you say that on a show you're too scared you're gonna lose your  fucking job you have enough money to retire don't don't take his shit yeah bye-bye oh wow  what bravo opie holy shit holy shit that's how we deal with shit we deal with facts on this 
[03:52:00]  fucking show right from his mouth he knows he's like what what were the ratings it's like well  don't ask don't ask opie what the fucking ratings are he's the one said telling uh howard what they are  and apparently obviously through that you could tell he didn't know what the fucking ratings were  so he was sucking how he's dick to fucking uh uh bolster his position over there and you hear 
[03:52:30]  how fuck him and you hear hi hope like we're still friends yeah hey how you doing because that's the  you know that's a phone call that's not like playing a fucking role on a radio station yeah  he knew why you were on a radio show bunch of phonies there you go take that to howard and he  he knew the show 0.0 he knew that fucking asshole we have a long ways to go in chicago but  every month it's gone up they showed us that i i don't know the exact numbers are given to you  i'll i'll get them for tomorrow if you really need to know but it's uh if the queue was 97 000 last 
[03:53:00]  month we started it was literally like 10 000 something like that and let me say something  that's completely honest with the people that aren't familiar with the inner workings of radio  our names aren't howard stern howard stern had a pretty nationally known fucking name we're opie and  anthony and in a lot of markets uh our name is known we go in new york boston things like that  but there are cities where people don't know us from a fucking hole in the wall and the truth of 
[03:53:30]  the matter is when we go into those cities it's not going to be like wait uh howard stern now on in  chicago people from chicago know the name so they would tune in you got to give the guy that you know  he's got the name recognition we go in we have to build an audience from nothing based on our  the quality of our show and that takes a while it doesn't just happen over fucking night  and what's been happening is we've been building that audience building we're not at a 0.0 when we 
[03:54:00]  first got to chicago when they took rover off the station our our time slot was at a 0.0 absolutely we  we started nowhere and then i remember went up to like a 0.1 and like oh yeah jesus that's like a  0.0 then it went up to like a 0.4 it's over a one now now you that's nothing to brag about i know  and and we're willing to admit that on our show with the way we are and the name recognition the  opian anthony show has uh around the country and in certain markets we don't that's what it takes 
[03:54:30]  it takes people listening to the show going fuck i like this and that alone takes time then it takes  that them to tell friends like holy shit did you hear this show i've been listening to it for a couple  of months oh let me check it out and they got to turn friends onto it they like it it's just the  way it's the nature of the beast when you're in a new market so it's not going to happen like that  it doesn't fucking happen maybe in fantasy movies like private parts it fucking happens like that  but in real life it takes time and howard and and his cronies having a huge laugh over that like 
[03:55:00]  i said right now as we're just doing our satellite show we have a bigger audience than howard that  is a fact and again like you were saying he's got a 0.0 in every every market in america right  because he's not on the air and we do try to keep it honest here's the deal we're on 23 regular  radio stations right now uh we're not going to make it in a bunch of those cities we're just not  yeah and one of them may be vegas i know they're excited about the only traveling virus this saturday  and they're pushing it like crazy and they're getting a response which uh just proves we don't 
[03:55:30]  have a 0.0 but once again it's nothing to brag about but we're gonna we're gonna kill in a bunch  of cities and we're gonna we're gonna be dropped in a bunch of cities that's how it works when howard  was at the top of his game he was getting dumped out of cities all the time picking up cities and  being dropped by cities that's how it's gonna happen so i know like he hates us and we hate him so it's  obvious to take the take the one market we completely blow and just blow it out of proportion and  everyone's laughing like that whole robin and arty lang who had one of the biggest fucking bombs at 
[03:56:00]  the box office ever but he's gonna laugh at us are you kidding me bro oof he did but there you go  you heard the real timid hey old how's it going and then oh what are the ratings he didn't even  know he was like a puppet wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow  it's like did you see boston he goes yeah yeah that was up oh so why'd you say we were flat and  everything he knows exactly what our ratings are of course he does he looks at him every  fucking time they come out and this guy used to say horrific things about howard and how howard  was done years ago blah blah blah you guys are great love you guys he's kissing his ass it's so 
[03:56:30]  fucking pathetic i can't even tell you it's one thing if you want to kiss his ass it's one thing  if you want to you know that's your gig now and you want to talk up your personalities i got no  problem with that that's business but then to turn around and and you know bash us because it's a  whole nother fucking it helps you in howard's world because you could get in on the laughs i slept in  this fucking guy's house oh it's not good do you fuck him no he's not my type he's too fat  i like a chubbier boy yeah but dude i i i i've been in his house it's not like he was just another 
[03:57:00]  program director we were friends and it's like you look i understand you're part of the competition  but to go that far and have to drink the kool-aid and suck his cock i didn't that is a pathetic human  being i didn't hear the very end of that how did that end he he kind of went like you're oh you're  you're what you're ridiculous you're ridiculous goodbye yeah listen on the replay and see how  ridiculous ridiculous we don't hide we'll take it right to you anyone that's what we say 
[03:57:30]  did you guys hear that on the air because that was a little bit a little bit because i was just uh  i was just talking to him yeah i know all right i was able to hear a little why didn't you put him  on the air he would i he wouldn't have gone on the air he wouldn't have gone on the air it's  competition you know were you able to hear maybe we could transcribe the phone calls yeah maybe i  i can hear like it's a little irritating yeah please all right good

[03:58:30]  the difference between his 0.0 and your 0.0 is that you're on the radio there and he isn't  quit using that shitty argument opie that's kind of a joke exactly that was the joke oh my god the  guy actually thought we were stating like ratings facts yeah and now if i look he's got a 0.0 yes  well see he isn't on tech oh well technically we're bombing in england i'm gonna have to recalculate  fucking idiots thank god that guy wrote in we'll have to recalculate hey look at that 
[03:59:00]  what joel makes love to the camera doesn't he like a fucking dead person  definitely fucking joel doesn't move on camera he's got the best timing ever though he he's he's  pretty much out at cbs goodbye so long so long goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye he's shaking  hands got the suitcase with the clothes hanging out the side of it goodbye goodbye goodbye the  fucking the conan photographs where the mouth is animated are are more believable looking than he is 
[03:59:30]  he's not alive right there that's a photo of joel hollander that was blown up  with mccord's hand behind i'm like that whore in lamb chop  who's that cunt with lamb chop dead she's dead she was very badly raped you see  sherry lewis oh sherry lewis we should bury my footner pussy oh didn't we used to do sherry lewis  yeah we used to do a pork chop bit oh my god it was awful get your hand out of my ass you  fucking cunt why couldn't we have a 0.0 when you were doing the lunch yeah the pork chop my it's 
[04:00:00]  fucking it was lamb chop wasn't it i don't know yeah lamb chop it was the dead chicken lamp was  that just your hand oh no that's senior wensa yeah he said she just took a sock and put like  fucking buttons on it and then she would hide her arm mint like you couldn't tell with the yeah she  twists her arm around like this isn't my arm it's a real talking sock you idiots meanwhile she's  always holding from the same angle and it looks like just like a sock and her other arm is hidden  hey you liar where's your other arm pull it out that's right hey the whoopee thing they just won't 
[04:00:30]  believe us dave in pittsburgh it was opie's insane comment did whoopee calls back during the break  and wanted to talk to where to god will be well she called for op first she goes she wanted to speak to  opie then opie goes and he puts her on speaker phone and then her and aunt are uh are talking all  of them are and i walk in and we all talk and uh mentioned the ted dancing thing and she goes look  that happened 13 years ago i didn't want to get into it i've explained that and she admitted that's  what it was yeah she didn't want to talk about that so she she says it's something that happened  13 years ago whatever tell us what we know we're not going to out and out lie to you about that 
[04:01:00]  we're not going to create that that happened i mean i'll lie about a lot of things i'll lie about hiv  status the age of that girl i fingered the movie theater but i am not going to lie listen she  comments uh about and then quickly goes hang up hang up listen you can hear it for yourself and then  we'll play it out she goes oh come on i don't know the conversation with whoopee what about the ted  dancing is i mean you guys caught you were making a racial point no no but i'm saying oh hang up hang 
[04:01:30]  how could you say who didn't hear that you said the ted dancing thing why would you hang up oh  another why would she hang up on that why would she hang up with the ted dancing another knockout  punch for the boys why would you hang up on that that was a very legitimate question that is an  absolute valid point it's like how come it was okay when ted dancing got in blackface and she came to  his defense and that was considered very offensive very racist and uh she came to his defense on that 
[04:02:00]  um but she will uh say that uh imus should be fired for doing what he did was a bad joke and  and i wasn't even attacking her with that my point was how can you defend one aspect of of racial  parody but not another aspect of it like when you're involved with it because you're black it's okay hang up  hang up you hear it yeah hang up ted dancing hang up incidentally uh is anybody else not surprised  that the press conference is starting late oh oops oh wow hey line of the day brought to you by
