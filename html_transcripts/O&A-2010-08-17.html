<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts reacting negatively to an off-air event before pivoting to a discussion about Muslim leaders potentially abandoning a community center near Ground Zero and a news story detailing a Taliban stoning of a couple.  Opie then launched into a furious rant about a city employee aggressively removing sturdy umbrellas from a Barnes & Noble parklet during a rainstorm, viewing it as an unnecessary power play. He described the incident, mentioning he filmed it but deleted the footage.  He heavily criticized the bystanders’ inaction.  This led to a broader discussion about arbitrary rule enforcement in New York City, with anecdotes from Opie, Kenny, and callers sharing similar experiences with overly zealous ticketing by park workers and traffic agents.  The hosts expressed their shared contempt for such situations.  The segment concluded with discussion of K-Rod's season-ending injury resulting from punching his girlfriend's father, the financial consequences, Opie's appearance on Red Eye with Buzzy from the Melvins, a giveaway of his old digital camera (containing a surprise photo), and the failing BlackBerry Torch, leading to Opie’s switch to Android.

The next segment heavily focused on the BlackBerry Torch's failure, with the hosts and caller Brian from Chicago using highly offensive language to criticize the phone and BlackBerry's management.  Android alternatives were briefly debated.  The second major topic was the public exposure of professional wrestler "Mr. Ass" (Billy Gunn)'s affair via Facebook and YouTube. Sam Roberts, the wrestling correspondent, detailed how a Canadian woman posted pictures and recordings of their affair, leading to its discovery by his wife.  The hosts and callers reacted with shock, amusement, and highly offensive commentary, dissecting the recordings and the woman's actions, including speculation about her motivations and Mr. Ass' future.  The discussion included sexually explicit and offensive language, along with misogynistic comments. A caller provided a YouTube link, and the segment included mention of WFX Wrestling and former guest Bushwhacker Luke.

The following segment started with a discussion of celebrities and their publicists downplaying client deaths, shifting to a German pop star on trial for concealing her HIV status.  Graphic speculation about transmission followed, with the hosts and Danny rating women's attractiveness relative to AIDS risk.  The conversation then turned to a plane crash in Columbia and a video of a plane being struck by lightning, with a caller, an air traffic controller, explaining the phenomenon.  This led to a discussion of the reopened Gulf shrimping season after the oil spill and the safety of Gulf seafood.  Further calls involved shark videos and a debate on catch-and-release fishing ethics.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a blog post criticizing Jim Norton's comedic review of "Eat, Pray, Love," with the blogger joining the show.  Norton defended his review as satire.


A subsequent segment focused on the blog post criticizing Jim Norton’s movie review, which he admitted he wrote without seeing the film.  The female blogger, Sarah, argued against Norton's arguably misogynistic language.  The conversation explored common tropes in female-led films, with Norton and the hosts expressing their dislike for certain portrayals while acknowledging biases.  Sarah initially defended her critique but later apologized for misinterpreting Norton's intent, admitting shared criticisms and clarifying her blog’s scope.  The discussion broadened to feminism, comedy, and societal attitudes toward women, including whether feminist critiques apply to comedy.  The conversation shifted to cover songs, with many listener calls suggesting various artists' interpretations (including bluegrass "Gin and Juice" and a James Taylor-esque "X Gon' Give It to Ya").  Personal anecdotes and tangents, including a humorous discussion of a news report about Anthony Cumia's ex-girlfriend, were interspersed. The hosts also commented humorously on a picture of Sarah.


The final segment centered around a Twitter game, "Best Cover Ever."  Opie, Anthony, and guest Jimmy discussed numerous song covers, including Shinedown's "Simple Man," Hendrix's "All Along the Watchtower," Ram Jam's and Spiderbait's "Black Betty," and Chris Cornell's "Thank You."  The conversation included expletives and mentions of Metallica, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, and Pearl Jam.  Listener Madonna Mike misidentified a Van Morrison performance as a Pink Floyd cover.  Opie shared a childhood anecdote about a Charlie Daniels Band concert. The segment concluded with listener suggestions and banter, including discussion of Billy Corgan and his perceived "whining."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:00:30]  Shut up. Shut your fucking mouth. This is terrible. We just suck all around.  I hope you show restraint in fucking my girlfriend. This stinks.  Fucking shut the fuck up. We get it. We get it. We get it.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  What happened?  I actually said wow. I didn't realize it.  Oh, I heard that just as I was turning on the mics.  Oh, good. Excellent. Muslim leaders abandon Ground Zero Community Center plans. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, is that breaking news?  It's right here, yeah. Muslim leaders to abandon.  This is a possibility. This might have been as good as I thought.  After weeks of heated debate over plans for an Islamic community center near Ground Zero,  the site of the 9-11 attacks on New York, it seems Muslim leaders will soon back down,  agreeing to move to a new site.  So far, that's in the future. It seems and agreeing. Hopefully that will happen. 
[00:01:30]  Okay, so it's not official, but it looks like we're leaning that way, which, you know, seems to be the thing to do,  because there are a lot of people very upset about this.  Although someone pointed out yesterday that there's a lot of debauchery around Ground Zero.  Yeah.  Strip clubs and OTBs and fast food joints.  Well, strippers didn't fly planes into the buildings.  No, I know.  They didn't be the problem.  Good point, good point.  But that's good. You know what?  If they do, and if they move somewhere, because they legally don't have to, 
[00:02:00]  I think most people look at Muslims like, you know what?  Hey, that's kind of appreciated. That was reasonable.  Yeah.  That's a nice thing.  Oh, absolutely. It's a good PR move for the Muslim community.  Wow.  And they could use some positive PR, right?  They very rarely, especially with now the, again, the Taliban extreme,  they stoned this couple to death.  They just ran away and wanted to be with each other,  and I guess their families had other plans with other people.  Right.  And they were just stoned together in the town square.  Over love.  It's like Romeo and Juliet and rocks were thrown at them. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, imagine Romeo and Juliet being buried up to their heads and then stoned to death.  They really don't. They frown on romance.  Yeah, they don't like romance too much.  No.  Because the families want to get something out of it.  You know, a few sheep, a few fucking goats, whatever they trade for the love of the other.  It's amazing how they say things like it's an honor killing,  but it's like you're throwing rocks at somebody that you spent your whole life with.  Right.  How are you doing that?  Yeah, that's kind of twisted.  You gave birth to this person because the families do it, right? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, I think so.  So you're killing your own daughter or your own son with rocks?  Is that what you're trying to tell me?  It doesn't make sense.  Or does the town people decide?  I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know either.  It might have been the Taliban who did it in this case,  but the family weighs in on it and they're a part of it and they understand it's a...  But Jesus Christ, doesn't anybody just get yelled at?  I know.  Don't Muslims just yell at you ever?  That's just not strong enough for them.  They keep everyone in line, though. 
[00:03:30]  Something to be said about that.  I'm not saying I would like to throw rocks at a lot of people in this building, actually.  There's a lot of people you come across you would like to throw rocks at.  For example, yesterday I was...  You know where Barnes and Noble is?  Barnes and Noble is?  Yes.  A lot of people say Nobles.  Barnes and Nobles.  I was hanging out there drinking a little fucking vegetable drink after working out.  Sitting under an umbrella, people watching, checking my Twitter, just kind of hanging out.  Texting people, just enjoying myself, just me. 
[00:04:00]  Just hanging out before I go back home, right?  And all of a sudden, you know that rainstorm that came in, those thunderstorms?  I didn't...  Horrible rain here in New York for about, what, 15, 20 minutes?  No big deal.  I'm under this huge umbrella.  Nice.  Starts pouring.  It's...  I have a perfect spot.  Everyone's getting soaked, running like lunatics for cover.  And I'm under this umbrella, just enjoying a nice summer rain.  This fucking douchebag.  And I did get it on video.  And then I had to...  I had to delete the video. 
[00:04:30]  Because I'm like, people are going to think...  Well, they already think I'm insane.  But they're going to really know I'm insane.  So I had to actually delete a video yesterday instead of posting it.  This guy comes up and goes,  These umbrellas are for shade, not to protect you from the rain.  I have to pull the umbrellas down.  I'm like, if you do that, I'm going to get completely soaked.  You understand that?  I don't care.  I've got to do it.  And starts just aggressively taking the umbrellas down.  And I wasn't the only one. 
[00:05:00]  Now people are getting completely soaked because this asshole has to have some kind of power trip.  He worked at Barnes & Noble?  No.  It's that little park outside there.  There's a little strip of land right outside Barnes & Noble.  That Bloomberg set up?  Is that one of the ones in the middle of the lane that Bloomberg set up?  Probably.  It has a few tables, a bunch of pigeons, and fucking umbrellas to make sure you don't get wet.  Who did it?  A guy that works for who?  I guess he's a park guy or something.  I don't know.  I guess his whole job is that little area.  To make sure he cleans up the fucking pigeon poop and make sure people get wet. 
[00:05:30]  Who takes an umbrella down in the rain?  Yeah, and I'm like, are you kidding me?  How about we wait?  Because it was obviously this storm was flying through.  So I'm just motherfuckering him to his face.  I almost pushed him down.  I was enraged yesterday.  Yeah, that's irritating.  And other people were enraged.  Like, seriously?  Seriously?  What good are you doing by taking these umbrellas down in the middle of a torrential downpour?  So then I'm out there in the middle of the fucking room. 
[00:06:00]  I'm just getting soaked.  I'm like, really?  This had to happen, right?  For what reason?  For what good reason?  And he works for the city, obviously.  So what good did he do for the people yesterday?  Why would they spend all that money and put umbrellas up and when it rains, remove them?  Yeah, because everyone ran under him because, you know, you're trying to get cover immediately.  It's one of those fucking storms that come out of nowhere, right?  So people are under him fucking just waiting it out.  And there are these heavy-duty fucking umbrellas. 
[00:06:30]  Nothing's going to happen to them.  It's not flimsy umbrellas that are going to get destroyed by the rain.  It's amazing.  These umbrellas were completely handling the fucking water.  That's bureaucracy.  That's what this country is for.  It's just bureaucracy and red tape.  And you don't know why you're doing things, but you do them.  Someone told me I got to do it.  It's not even a somebody.  This is a guy that got just a ton.  This is a – we've talked about this a bunch of times.  A guy that got just a little power through his job and thinks he's like this fucking world leader, I guess. 
[00:07:00]  You know, he's protecting that little piece of land for who and for what reason.  Sorry.  I was out of my fucking mind, and I filmed the whole thing.  And then I'm walking home.  I'm like, I can't post this.  I have to delete this video, you know?  I have to delete this.  I was amazed what was coming out of my mouth.  And I came close to pushing the guy down because now I'm just getting completely drenched.  Where did he take the umbrellas?  He just knocked them down. 
[00:07:30]  He just made them fold in?  Yeah.  One at a time.  So – and then people – because, I mean, we were stranded.  You know, it was that bad of a rainstorm that people were moving from the umbrella that he was knocking down to the other ones.  So – and then eventually he got to the last one where there was about six or seven of us still, you know, hanging in there because we didn't feel like getting wet.  And then he knocked that one down.  And now we're just all standing in the rain, and we're all looking at him like, really?  You had to do this?  If everybody would have just surrounded it and said, you're not doing this, you're not taking this umbrella down, he would have had no choice but to walk away. 
[00:08:00]  That's what confuses me because everyone else – and then I'm thinking, wow, I must be a complete lunatic because everyone else is like, oh, okay, they just accept the rules or accept what this guy's doing.  I'm like, no, this is ridiculous what he's doing.  Don't you understand?  That's why there will never be a revolution in this country.  No.  Because there's a bunch of lemmings that, you know, there's a lot of shit that happens that doesn't make sense, but they just go along with it.  I was the only guy yelling and screaming like, seriously, this is ridiculous.  You do realize that?  And everyone else is like, oh, well, I guess we got to, like, get wet now. 
[00:08:30]  So it's amazing how they accept it.  I couldn't rally anyone to, you know, yell at this guy like, stop, stop, your umbrella's going to be okay.  So someone was asking if it was windy.  It wasn't windy at all.  It was just rain coming in really, really fucking fast.  That's just a guy being a complete fuck.  And look, I could handle getting wet.  It wasn't about that because I know people now beat me up.  I could get wet.  Getting wet stinks, though, if you don't have to.  But it wasn't about that.  It was more that this guy has some kind of tiny little power and had to use it at that moment. 
[00:09:00]  There's no reason.  So he'd rather protect umbrellas than human beings, I guess.  Again, somebody probably told him one time, that's what you're supposed to do.  And he just does it.  And he probably secretly loves it.  Of course, because you know what?  I couldn't phase the guy.  And, you know, and I was I was so enraged.  I was thinking of getting fucking racist because I want to hurt him and everything I was throwing at him, man.  He was fucking ducking and he didn't take any of them. 
[00:09:30]  So he must get yelled at a lot.  It probably makes him even happier.  Anyone whose job is like that and they get yelled at a lot, then your job sucks.  Right.  If you're if you're working with the people and your job is always getting you yelled at, then you just suck.  Right.  And what you do sucks and it's not important.  Maybe I should have brought the video in.  Absolutely.  Or at least the audio.  Do you still have it?  I didn't put it on.  No, I completely deleted it on the way home because I was I was out of my mind and I'm watching it back going. 
[00:10:00]  You sound like a fucking mental patient.  No, you should have kept that.  I know.  I probably should have.  That's a good one.  But then I was I was just thinking, you know what?  No, just fucking I'll bitch and scream about it on the radio and that'll be it.  But you're justified.  Fucking asshole.  Fucking.  I'm still mad.  You know how happy he was to make a bunch of fucking Upper West Side white people stand in a rain?  You should see how I walk around.  I don't look like an Upper West.  I look like I really needed to be under that umbrella.  Which parts of Noble do you mean?  Is it on? 
[00:10:30]  Well, now we go real local.  It's on Broadway in like sixty seven five sixty six.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know exactly.  There's a tiny little park out there outside the subway.  Oh, right, right, right.  Station.  So you just kind of sit.  There's tables and chairs and umbrellas.  Why don't you run into the bookstore?  Well, I ran under the the awning of Barnes and Noble.  That's how I mean, that's how the story ends.  I waited out with a bunch of people.  But I was completely soaked because even just running that, it could have been more than 30 feet.  I got completely soaked.  That's how bad it was raining. 
[00:11:00]  Did they take the awning down at Barnes and Noble?  That would have been great.  Yeah, no kidding.  They started just taking things down.  Everywhere you went in the city, they just take down the cover.  Fucking asshole.  I will see him again.  And now I'm going to make his life a living hell.  I will see him again.  You should film him every day.  Well, that's what I'm going to do now.  Now I'm going to just film him being an asshole, you know.  But the last time I filmed a park person being an asshole, YouTube yanked my fucking video.  When they were just, you know, giving people tickets in Central Park for no reason. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, it was funny.  Yeah, it was a very funny video.  A fat lady was slurping up some kind of delicious fatty drink.  And I said, you know, that's why you're fat.  And YouTube had a problem with that.  They leave bum fights up.  Yeah, no kidding.  YouTube is weird, man.  And guys getting hit by buses and stuff.  But if you comment to a lady that that's why you're fat because she's, you know, sucking down a high-calorie drink,  YouTube had a problem with that.  But who at YouTube saw that? 
[00:12:00]  Considering what they do leave up, it's not a copyright infringement.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And I was asking some hard-hitting fucking questions.  I was doing some journalism before that.  And then I decided to make it hurt a little bit to this woman because she wouldn't answer any of my questions.  Yeah, she sucked.  That's what the video was about.  And then a mere week or two weeks later, you got the guy in Seattle, the police officer, you know,  dealing with a couple people with punching and slapping going on.  Why is that okay to leave up?  But mine isn't. 
[00:12:30]  Wouldn't you love to find one person who makes those decisions at YouTube?  I tried because I got connections at YouTube.  I tried.  But, you know, you go into some mass email fucking system.  You can't just fucking call somebody.  They suck.  No, and then they sort of get back to you, and boy, they just throw the rules at you,  and then you have to read pages of rules to figure out which rule you might have broke.  You can't get a human being to actually go, well, this is why it was yanked.  Facebook's the same way.  It's like both of these, and again, I know that Facebook has 200 million people, 
[00:13:00]  and they can't be taking all those calls.  Right.  But it's just this anonymous system.  You can't get a real answer.  Well, if you go online, it's like, I don't want to go online.  Just walk me through it.  It'll take me two minutes.  Yeah, I need an answer.  Hire more people to give answers.  You know, you're obviously very successful, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter.  You've got to hire more people to explain some shit, you know?  YouTube should absolutely give you an explanation as to why that was yanked or who yanked it,  but there's no accountability. 
[00:13:30]  No.  It's just somebody in an office who might have gotten one complaint.  Someone might have complained, a hater.  Oh, I don't.  That's me.  You can't show me.  I'll sue you, and then they pull it.  I don't know, man.  This was completely acceptable.  You know, I was asking some park workers why they were giving out bullshit tickets,  because that's the one thing about living in New York City that drives me nuts,  the people that just go around giving out bullshit tickets.  You see it all the fucking time.  And I don't know why I'm bothered by that, because it's not me usually,  although I've been hit over the years, you know?  It's irritating.  It's irritating because they're small people in the sense that they're not. 
[00:14:00]  They want to be cops.  Right.  They want to have authority and power.  They want to traffic, whatever they're called.  Yeah, I'm not talking NYPD.  I mean, you know, they've got to do what they've got to do.  Although some of the delivery trucks, I think, although that's not really NYPD,  even though those idiots are wearing the NYPD uniform.  No, they're not really NYPD.  They're not real fucking cops, you know, carrying guns and shit.  Kenny got stopped by one of those guys.  Yes, maybe he should tell the story, but it was so enraging, this little wannabe. 
[00:14:30]  He was not a cop.  Yeah.  He wants to be a cop.  He's such a little person, and you can see he wants to have a real cop  who will a lot of times let you do something.  Yeah.  Ah, go ahead, because he doesn't have to prove anything.  He's a cop.  You could talk your way out of a speeding ticket easier  than talking your way out of a parking ticket.  That's ridiculous.  Now, a lot of times, of course, the cops are going to give you the speeding ticket.  They're doing their jobs, whatever.  You know, I'm not happy, but, you know, they're doing their jobs.  These parking people will not listen to shit. 
[00:15:00]  I've seen pregnant women with strollers running back to their car  because their meter just literally ran out begging and pleading,  and the guy just doesn't even see them, just continues writing the ticket.  Although they've made that easy, too, because now it's just scanning shit.  So they only have to be at your car for seconds at this point now.  Jimmy Justice, that guy who would annoy them on video, was the greatest.  Rules.  He tortured them.  Yeah.  And they should be because most of them are not nice.  Most of them are not very competent.  They're not qualified to do real police work. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  They're just fucking ticket.  You know what they are?  They're like street sweepers.  They're like little animals that go around and gobble up mistakes and spit it out for money for the city.  Yeah.  They're not doing a valuable service.  Not at all.  Not at all.  It's just annoying people and making money for the city because the city's fucked up their budget.  So now they have to go out there and, you know, try to help out the city by giving out dumb, ridiculous tickets to people.  So, but this guy with the umbrella yesterday, God, I, I, and I was so enraged. 
[00:16:00]  I couldn't even film the video.  Right.  I was like, I was shooting the umbrella, the ground because I was shaking.  I'm like, you're really going to, uh, you know, force us all out in the rain for what reason?  Give me a reason.  And then when he said the umbrellas are for the sun, not rain.  What?  What are you talking about?  It's like, they're trying to save money here in the city.  Right.  First of all, building those was ridiculous.  Not the one you're talking about. 
[00:16:30]  The little parks.  Okay.  I'm talking about the ones in the street.  Yeah.  And to have a guy whose job is to stand there like a twat.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  I guess he was waiting to finally have something to do with his job.  And I guess when he saw the rain, it was, it was time for him to do his job.  He's got to pick up gum wrappers and rap shit and rat rat shit.  Right.  He sweeps up dirt.  That's what he does.  Yeah.  He probably had a giant garbage bag.  And was he wearing orange?  No.  Does he wear orange?  No.  No.  No.  No.  Sure he worked for the park.  He wasn't just a psychopath.  He could have been just a homeless guy. 
[00:17:00]  And that's his territory.  Yeah.  He's just some bum.  Some guy who doesn't like a bunch of people enjoying the fucking.  Right.  Protection of the umbrellas.  Ah, very good.  Let me say hi to Cassius in Brooklyn.  What's up, Cassius?  Hello.  Amen.  How you doing?  Good, brother.  Yeah, I just totally know this rage you're talking about.  This summer, I went down to Rockaway Beach here, obviously in the city.  And unbeknownst to me, I hadn't been there to this beach in a few years. 
[00:17:30]  And all of a sudden, I noticed there's these parks department guys standing literally on  the sand right where the water's coming up.  And they've got books on them so they can give people tickets.  And I got into a huge yelling match with one of them because there's a part of the beach  where only surfers are allowed to go.  But there's not a single sign posted.  And they wait until you go into the water. 
[00:18:00]  And then they start yelling at you.  Yeah.  And it's just so unbelievable.  Like, keeping you from standing underneath an umbrella for like, what the fuck are you  talking about?  Like, it just makes no sense whatsoever.  And he was black, right?  This guy?  Well, you know, I really try not to go down that road.  But yes, he was black.  Yeah.  But I don't think it was a black thing.  I think it was more of a, I see it.  I see it.  It doesn't matter what color you are. 
[00:18:30]  People get these jobs with a tiny bit of power.  And they fucking just get huge.  They get power hungry over the most ridiculous thing.  I mean, I got a ticket once because I rode my bike on a pier where Jimmy and I live.  I mean, somehow, I guess the city came up with this fucking law.  You ride your bike on a pier.  You get a ticket.  It's not bothering anybody.  These piers that I'm talking about are, I don't know, how wide across. 
[00:19:00]  It's plenty of room for people walking, people with strollers, people on bikes, rollerblading.  It's a huge, wide pier.  But I guess the city decided, well, here's another way to make money.  You know, every time you see a guy on his bike, and usually no one's racing up and down  the pier, you know, you're kind of just on your bike, maybe going the speed of foot traffic.  Seriously.  It's easier just to kind of stay on your bike instead of get off it and walk it.  And I watch these guys give tickets all day long because the little sign they post is 
[00:19:30]  kind of out of the way.  You've got to kind of be looking for it.  And I watch people day after day try to explain, like, well, I didn't see the sign.  And then they're just there with their pad, angrily writing tickets.  Like, what job is that?  What are they protecting?  Yeah.  And not be willing to fucking give people a warning, you know.  Right.  Yeah, because that's what you see is people begging, like.  I don't know this first time and don't do it again.  You know, that's like normal.  That's human.  Yeah.  A lot of people are saying, oh, well, I didn't know. 
[00:20:00]  Now I know.  And they're like, well, I don't know what to tell you.  Here's your ticket.  The instructions are on the back.  Do you know that one of the times I've wanted to commit a homicide the most, it was so needless.  And you're right.  It's not a white black thing.  This guy was a white guy.  And this was when I went to the metal.  It's when Sabbath got back together in 99.  And me and Florence went to the Sabbath.  And after the show, they fired these, like, cannons.  These streamers came down from the ceiling that just said Black Sabbath on them.  They were very small little streamers, maybe, oh, four inches long and maybe a half inch high. 
[00:20:30]  And there was, you know, probably a million of them that fell out of the ceiling.  And they would rain on the audience.  So I was just picking a couple of these teeny little slips of paper up.  And a guy comes over and he goes, hey, you can't, you got to put them back.  And I'm like, you're joking, right?  He goes, no, I'm not joking.  You're not supposed to take them with you.  And he was making an issue.  And now I would take it.  Like, it's 10 years later, I would tell him, you're out of your fucking mind.  But then I was like, oh, all right, I just, like, what am I, what are you doing? 
[00:21:00]  They're little teeny streamers, you fuck.  It's just a guy who wanted to say no.  A lot of these guys, the problem is life tells them no.  Their wives don't fuck them.  Women don't fuck them.  And if they're big, fat women, you know, look at these people.  They're big, fat shows.  Everything is saying no to them.  Yeah, people that have real power know how to use it in general.  But it's these jobs that give them just a tiny bit of power.  They, I don't get it. 
[00:21:30]  Me and Kenny were going.  They become Napoleon or something.  We were going to the Newark airport.  And a lot of times there's traffic at the Lincoln.  Well, Kenny has a badge and maybe he'll shoot up past some of the traffic and make the left where the traffic cops won't let you make the left.  Traffic agents, not traffic cops.  Right.  And they always, if you hold up a badge, always let you go.  They don't even question it.  No.  This one little Filipino guy still tried to wave Kenny on.  Like go straight, even though he held up a badge.  Mm-hmm.  You know, Kenny's not going to make the left. 
[00:22:00]  He made the left anyway.  And the guy came over and started yelling at him, you, pull over, pull over.  I want to see your ID card.  And Kenny's like, well, why can't I show it to you right here?  He's like, but everybody saw you disrespect me.  He, he was complaining about being, it's like, what are you fucking, you, you have that uniform on and you're trying to sound like a fucking, a hip hop video from the early nineties, you asshole.  Right.  A guy, like the fact is he was disrespecting the badge.  The nerve of this little piece of shit. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  To tell a guy, show him a badge to keep, what are you doing?  Unbelievable.  Like if a guy has a badge, that means he is at least at one point carried a gun and was a real cop.  Right.  Who the fuck are you?  Right.  Don't even question it.  Just assume, you know, he's doing the right thing and fucking let him go.  Little twat.  He probably didn't make the height requirements in the police test.  Little fella.  Probably didn't even try.  Half these people don't even try for the real job.  He had braces too.  He had adult braces, which was great.  Which was great. 
[00:23:00]  He's like, you know, he has a little cock.  He's a, he's a small man.  He has a little cock.  A little flea cock.  A little cock.  A little mosquito cock.  A little fucked up teeth.  A little cock guy.  He wants respect.  He wants women to respect him.  And life has just laughed at him.  Yeah.  And he just didn't, didn't like the fact that he wouldn't, he waved Kenny on.  And Kenny, you know, Kenny is not going to fucking listen to that.  No, he don't care.  Unless he was a real cop, then he would listen.  Let's say hi to Sean in Virginia.  Sean.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, uh, one time I was flying into Midway from LAX, you know, I figured I'd stop and get  fucking one of these cappuccinos from Starbucks.  I never had one.  Well, I had a sip and it tasted like ass.  So I went down the escalator and I stopped by this coffee shop, put some sugar and cream  in it.  And I'll try to make it taste less ass-like.  So, uh, I'm mixing it all up and the dude who works there comes up to me.  He's like, hey, if you're going to use our condiments, you could at least buy my coffee.  And there's like these eight other people around me.  And I was, I was like, dude, if I give you a fucking quarter, will you shut up and leave 
[00:24:00]  me alone?  And like, he just looked at me like I did shit in his face and everyone started laughing  at him.  Dude, it was one of the funniest moments of my life.  Yeah, right on.  Good, good for you, man.  I don't know if I, if I could have been there with you, dude, I, in a minute, I would have  been like, get the fuck away from here.  What is wrong with you?  I couldn't rally anyone.  I'm like, really?  You're just going to allow this asshole to, to have a power trip in the middle of a, a torrential  downpour and we're all going to get soaked.  And you're all, I'm looking around like, really?  You're all going to just deal with, you know, go with this. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  I mean, not one of you get a question, this asshole for doing this.  And you nailed it on the head.  You said, that's why there'll never be a revolution.  A bunch of fucking lemons.  They just want to sit there and smile and do, oh yes, I'll do what I'm told.  They just, oh, oh, okay.  I actually heard a guy, we're under the umbrella, right?  So you got a picture.  There's like five or six umbrellas.  And he's, he's the one, I was at the one on the, uh, all the way at the one end.  And I ran, I figured like, all right, I'm going to skip the other umbrellas because he's 
[00:25:00]  going for those.  And by the, if he, if I just keep getting, you know, you know, shut out and pushed out  of an umbrella, I really will strangle this guy.  So I decided to go to the last umbrella.  I'm like, at least that'll give me some fucking time.  And maybe the stupid rain will, will stop.  And I actually heard one guy go, well, I guess we're next.  He goes, I guess we're next because, because this asshole is taking down the umbrella right  next to us.  And then this, all this guy can muster up is, I guess we're next. 
[00:25:30]  And I'm looking, I'm like, really?  How about we stand our fucking ground?  Sometimes in life, you go right ahead, sir.  Good.  All right.  Go ahead.  What happens?  Never be, never be ashamed.  You do not have rage issues.  There's nothing wrong with that.  That is how people.  I don't know.  I've, I've punched fucking, fucking token boots.  I have an issue that I'm working on though.  Thank you, Sean.  Jimmy, what were you saying?  There's times in life where it's like, I know physical violence is wrong, but sometimes 
[00:26:00]  a fucking, a right hook or a jab is the answer.  Yeah.  It's unfortunate.  And this is why I'm not, God gives us what we can handle.  As they say, I'm a funny guy.  I'm not a big dude.  Right.  If I was built like Liddell or Tito or anything, I know I'd be in prison.  I would love to be that big for a week just to knock that guy out in front of everybody.  I came close yesterday.  I really did.  I felt myself actually come out of my own body because I was, I was just that enraged. 
[00:26:30]  I'm like, you're, you're going to allow people just to get soaked because you're an  asshole.  Really?  Because you are on some power chip.  And someone saying they were probably worried that, uh, you know, you guys are going to  get hit by lightning.  No, that's not what the guy said.  He didn't care.  He didn't care.  He said the umbrellas are for fucking sun, not rain.  He actually said that.  He's no one is rooting for you to not get hit by lightning while they go over and handle  the metal object.  Yeah, exactly.  This guy's not trying to protect these Upper West Siders. 
[00:27:00]  He was happy to tell you, get out.  Right.  It was, it was him for striking back at life.  Not to oversimplify it, but that's what it is.  Well, he's in my neighborhood.  Now he's going to get a nice video made.  People are just shit.  Maybe a montage of him just picking his nose over and over again.  I'll do something.  You should just film him doing nothing or film him.  So you took the umbrella down and see if he'll give you an explanation on camera.  They never do.  I don't know why people are so terrified of a camera.  Like it's the fucking business end of a shotgun. 
[00:27:30]  But if you hold the camera up to someone and say, why did you do that?  You know, an honest man would go, look, I didn't want to do it, but it's my job.  I had to, because we've had umbrellas destroyed.  Guaranteed.  Oh, I don't film me.  Right.  I don't film.  Why?  Why?  Charlie in Georgia.  Charlie.  Charlie.  What's up, Charlie?  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Just going to let you all know, a few years back, me and my wife, she's my girl.  My wife and I.  Yes, my wife and I. 
[00:28:00]  High Five Eyes Amphitheater went to the Aerosmith Kiss concert.  It's been raining a little bit all day.  Going in, your usual savages, big fat lady, sitting there to give her a badge, give her a little hat.  She's sitting there tearing tickets, that's all she really does for a living.  We get in there with umbrellas.  She's like, you can't take those in.  I'm like, it's about to storm.  The bottom's about to drop out.  She's stopping everybody.  The same thing, Oprah, like it happened to y'all.  They're just taking the umbrellas from everybody.  They're like, well, okay, here you go. 
[00:28:30]  Here's our tarps.  I was like, look, it's about to fall.  The bottom's about to fall out on these people.  And they're like, doesn't matter.  I opened it up.  I was like, there's nothing in it.  We're not trying to hide anything.  We're just trying to keep dry.  Anyway, to make a long story short, missed the whole damn concert just because we got rained out.  Had to buy a trash bag from one of the vendors for like $20 just to shut my wife up.  Wait, you couldn't?  Hold on.  You had a tarp that you brought with you and they wouldn't let you use it?  No, they wouldn't let you in with it.  Just because this is power trip. 
[00:29:00]  They won't let you bring in umbrellas.  They won't let you bring in anything.  How about, was this 2003 when Kiss and Aerosmith toured together?  Yep, yep, 2003.  That's when I got my photo with Kiss.  Not that that's a bit of a side story.  I just wanted to make it about me and I didn't know exactly how I could.  It would have been a great concert.  We saw a little bit of it, but we just stuck, pretty much had to stick behind the awnings.  It was the original Kiss without Ace, though.  Unfortunately, Ace was not in that tour.  I thought Aerosmith had balls to follow Kiss.  I remember respecting Aerosmith for that.  I'm like, why would you go on after Kiss? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Kiss opened that tour.  That's a little weird.  Oh, what year?  2003.  2003.  Yeah.  But still, to follow that fucking, you know.  2003, though?  Aerosmith at that point.  They've had a couple of hits.  No, they have.  And, you know, Kiss was, you know, I guess hadn't had a hit in a little while.  Yeah.  Just to follow those.  Here's an instant feedback.  You guys should listen to yourselves bitching and whining because you can't break the rules.  Those are the type of people I can't live among, you fucking asshole.  You just accept every rule they give you? 
[00:30:00]  Really?  What is wrong with you?  Half the rules are bullshit in this country.  But that's not even bitching about the rules.  I didn't say we should be able to drive 100.  And Ope didn't say, look, what is it with these pigs telling me I can't take merchandise out of a store?  Right.  These are pointless, pointless little dictations by people who are enjoying dictating to you.  That's all it is.  Right.  It's fraudulent.  You just want somebody to be reasonable sometimes.  Right.  That's all.  Just be reasonable, you asshole.  Obviously, you're fucking going to make a few people miserable here because you're being a dick. 
[00:30:30]  How about you be reasonable?  Down by the Comedy Cellar, there's one block where you can park up to a certain time.  And everyone parks there.  I park there if I have an early spot because I can get out before 11.  But you can't park there all night.  I've literally watched them at 11.02 towing somebody.  It's like, man, what are you?  And they'll sit there and wait at 5 of 11.  It's like you're waiting for just a chance to fuck somebody else.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're not just coming upon it. 
[00:31:00]  You're waiting.  Yeah.  Like a serial killer, you fucking lunatic.  That's what it is with the street cleaning rule people.  They come by and two minutes after the fucking time limit's up, they're ticketing people and towing people.  They're enjoying it.  Or I've had a lot of times when I was living in Brooklyn, the front of my bumper would be,  like, because it's impossible to find parking.  The front of the bumper is just into the crosswalk.  Not even in the crosswalk.  Like on the paint strip that is painting the crosswalk.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  Not interfering with it whatsoever.  And there's a ticket.  It's like, you know, just throw someone a bone once.  Again, there are people who don't feel like they get any breaks and they don't understand what to do.  It's probably the first time any of them have had a say at anything.  No one listens to them in their lives.  They suggest something, their wives go, no.  They're big fat ladies.  They don't have boyfriends.  Or if they do, it's a miserable relationship.  They know he's fucking around.  This is the first time they've ever been able to say, this is how it's going to be and that's how it is. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Let Ant settle in.  You were completely right about the Jets-Giants game, by the way.  Yeah.  Who got hurt?  Your prediction.  I don't know if I said it on the air.  I'm like, I thought it was completely ridiculous to have a Jets-Giants preseason game to open up a brand new stadium  because you knew these animals wanted to get bragging rights over a game that doesn't matter as far as the real season goes.  Yeah, it wasn't just going to be a man.  And I said someone would get really fucking hurt.  Who did? 
[00:32:30]  Manning.  Manning fucking was bleeding out basically yesterday in front of everybody.  His fucking helmet popped off and then his forehead just slammed right into another guy's.  Yeah.  His bare forehead.  Yeah.  Oof.  He laid his head open.  What's the injury?  I don't even know.  I didn't watch the game.  I think it was seven stitches across his forehead.  Twelve stitches.  Twelve across his forehead.  He passed out on the field because of the blood.  Yeah, he was bleeding out in front of everybody last night.  That's exactly what I said was going to happen.  I'm telling you I'm a seer, but no one knows it yet. 
[00:33:00]  It's his fault.  I really am.  He changed the play without telling anyone.  Because they want to beat the shit out of the other fucking team.  It's a preseason game.  It's like a preseason fucking Islanders-Ranger game.  They're going to go for blood.  They're going to fucking hurt each other.  Yeah.  Of course.  And man, was he fucking bleeding.  Seriously, bragging rights over a fucking preseason game for a brand new stadium?  It's our stadium.  And they made it even more important with fireworks and all sorts of shit for a preseason game. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Fireman Ed was in rare form already.  He was in midseason form.  Really?  These guys are still fucking sore from starting to work out again.  The injury you're talking about, by the way, was a torn thumb ligament.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  What?  Ha, ha.  What?  K-Rod.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:34:00]  That's the other story.  He's out for the fucking season for punching his father-in-law.  Dummy.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Holy shit.  You fucking dummy.  What a dummy.  That's pretty fucking stupid.  I'm not saying I don't understand rage.  We all do dumb things.  But when you have a $37 million fucking contract.  Yeah, yeah.  And you throw a punch at your father-in-law at work.  Yeah, that's crazy. 
[00:34:30]  You dummy.  Father-in-law, too.  That's a little weird.  Even though the father...  What is that about?  I really haven't followed that story too closely.  I don't know what their dynamic is.  Maybe the father-in-law is a prick.  I just don't know.  I think you can figure it out.  You've got to treat your hands like a hand model and put oven mitts on.  Yes.  Like a Travis...  Oh, wow.  Damn.  I didn't get that.  He was telling K-Rod to man up and stop being a baby and pitch better.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's the report.  I mean, yeah, there's nothing... 
[00:35:00]  You know, nobody's said anything, but...  Well, the fucking guy is out for the season now for punching his father-in-law.  What a dummy.  Wow.  Is he going to sacrifice his contract?  Oh, I think they're going to take the money from him.  This scumbag.  If this is what happened, they said, if this is the clubhouse clubbering, do you have to  put two C words?  It's started after K-Rod, he launched into his foul mouth after the game tiraded to his  chick.  So people are saying father-in-law.  I think it's his girlfriend.  Her father intervened and stood up to him only to get pummeled by the pitcher as players, 
[00:35:30]  wives, and children looked on.  Aw.  What a role model.  The guy yelled, you can't talk to my daughter that way.  Apparently he could.  How humiliating to get beat up in front of you.  But, again, unless there's something I just don't know about this situation, what a piece  of shit.  Don't come to the stadium and talk to my daughter like that.  Oh, boy.  But he did, I will say that the pitcher did correct the father.  He, in fact, could speak to her that way. 
[00:36:00]  He certainly could, and he did.  How humiliating.  Now his thumb is no good.  That's ridiculous.  Good.  Good shithead.  Was he punching thumb first?  I don't know what he was doing.  What was he doing?  Well, now he's not going to be pitching properly, huh?  No.  That's so gross.  I couldn't be fucking happy.  I could not be happy.  It's not a knock on the Mets.  I want to see the Mets do okay.  You think he's going to put his injured thumb in his daughter's ass now?  You'd hope so.  You'd hope he's going to make some use of it.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Yeah, just the fucking thumb I broke on your father. 
[00:36:30]  Oof.  Right up the old shitter.  Oh, what a dirtbag.  In front of those fucking other people.  What a dirtbag.  Let's say hi to Chris in Ohio.  Chris.  What's up, man?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, just to ask you, when you were on the pier with the bicycle, what's to keep you from  saying just fuck off and ride away?  It's not like many people carry their ID and shit.  So what's the accountability?  Well, that's a very good question, and I learned the hard way, because the first time they  stopped me when I was on my bike on the pier, I just took their bullshit. 
[00:37:00]  And then I talked to a bunch of my NYPD friends, and they're like, you don't have to fucking  listen to those guys.  They're nobody.  Make them fucking chase you or make them get a real cop.  So now I kind of toy with those fuckers, because there's a few areas you're not supposed  to be on your bike, and I ride right by them, and they're yelling and screaming, and  they yell, stop, stop, stop, and I just keep fucking going now.  What are they going to do?  Right.  But I took it the first time.  I mean, I'm embarrassed to say I took it the first time, because I just didn't know. 
[00:37:30]  But now I do know.  Shame on you.  And now I kind of fuck with them when I feel like it, just a little bit.  But do you understand that by you riding away, that's what most people do.  And that's what their day is.  Stop now.  Yeah.  Stop now.  Yeah.  So the first one that stops, they're like, oh, we got a first timer.  Right.  Here's a ticket.  Right.  Most people probably don't get the tickets.  Well, now they've decided that you can't ride your bike down the ramp that leads to the  bike path and the piers where we live.  And there's a guy, a fat slob of a guy, his whole job now, I forgot about this part, he 
[00:38:00]  stands at the bottom of the ramp with his pad, because there's a tiny little sign at the top.  And most people, they're already starting their bike rides, so they're kind of on their  bike, and they're just kind of rolling down this ramp really slowly.  They're not doing a Lance Armstrong or anything.  And the guy is just waiting at the bottom of the ramp.  Really?  Throw his testicle at him.  Yeah, exactly.  His half-empty sack.  Right.  You know, squeeze this.  Your stupid day is done, and now you want to just kind of mellow out on your bike or do 
[00:38:30]  something recreational.  And there's an asshole making sure that's a problem as well.  Unbelievable.  People like to fuck with other people.  It's unbelievable.  It's human nature.  I really think it is.  I'm going to sit out and just film that fucking fat fuck.  He should.  You'll laugh.  Like, really, this is your job?  Do like a quick montage of how many people he fucking nails like that.  Every time we go down there, he's got somebody pulled over.  Pulled over.  Pulled over, yeah.  They're off their bike trying to explain themselves. 
[00:39:00]  Because I guess it was a safety issue.  There are people who wouldn't talk to him in real life.  A lot of them are probably lawyers and bankers.  And in their daily lives, they would look at that fucko and go, just get out of my office.  I charge $400 an hour, pig.  Get out.  Right.  But in that world, he's, might I say, a king shite.  Yes.  Here's someone following the K-Rod story.  Ken in Jersey.  Ken.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, brother. 
[00:39:30]  Hey, I'm not sure if you guys mentioned it, but K-Rod's not going to get paid for the  rest of the season because the injury happened outside of the game.  So he's pretty fucked up there.  That means the father-in-law is going to get a real beating now.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  He's going to get his ass kicked.  Yeah.  How much is he losing for the season?  I'm going to guess it's September, October.  A lot of August, September, October.  I mean, what is the season officially?  Playoff shit.  You know.  There's like one and a half months left.  So he could be losing almost half his salary, right?  Well, it says here that if they void the remainder of his contract for this year, that 
[00:40:00]  would be around $3 million.  Oh.  And if they void his entire contract, they would be getting rid of $18 million that they  owe him.  Good.  And they probably will try to do that now.  Oh.  $18 million.  They probably will just try to get rid of him.  And then I read this morning that unless he pleads guilty or is found guilty, it'll  be hard for them to actually void his contract.  But I can't see him playing for the Mets next year.  What do you mean? 
[00:40:30]  What do I mean?  Like, why would he have to plead guilty or be found guilty in the sense that...  For the Mets to be able probably to legally void his contract for that reason, he would  have to be found guilty of what he did.  So he'd probably go to court and plead down to a lesser charge.  I think he's been charged, yeah.  Right.  Well, yeah, he was definitely charged.  He was arrested.  How could you not guilty?  Yeah, he'll pitch again, but...  Yeah, but he just lost a nice fucking chunk of chain.  Hell yeah.  How dumb.  Like, do you ever...  Like, I've thought of being physically stupid and there's times where I wasn't. 
[00:41:00]  And it's...  Do you not...  With millions of dollars on the line, millions of fucking dollars.  What are you doing?  Right.  Yeah, he's probably going to have to take a lesser contract, too, if he goes to another  team.  Oh, yeah, this was very costly.  Very costly.  Oh, I just hate guys like that.  He sounds like a real bullying cunt.  You don't punch your girlfriend's father in front of other people unless you're a bullying  cunt.  You go into private and dump him in the face. 
[00:41:30]  Well, no, I'm sorry.  Your girlfriend's father.  They're not married, I don't think.  Are they married?  No.  Kenny, quick.  Look it up.  Why do they keep saying father-in-law, then?  I think it's the...  Him and the girlfriend have twins together, so it's actually the grandfather.  Hispanic.  That's father-in-law.  Now it makes sense.  That's father-in-law stuff.  You don't have to be officially married to have a father-in-law.  I told...  Kenny, I told the story, by the way, of your...  That little awful fucking traffic...  The Filipino?  Yeah.  What did he say?  You disrespect me. 
[00:42:00]  You disrespect me with his adult braces.  He should have run over his big toe.  It's an adult brace.  I've never wanted to see Kenny's big, long arm shoot out of the fucking driver's window.  And just...  You know how mad he would have been if you knocked his teeth out and ruined his adult braces?  Yeah.  Just make it look like scrap metal in his mouth.  A little twisted.  Like a guardrail that got hit with a truck.  He'd have to have his teeth put back on and leave the braces where they are.  What a boob.  All right.  Why don't we...  We'll take our first break.  And continue with some other shit, I guess. 
[00:42:30]  Sweet knee.  Let's make love.  The Virus Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Oh, you know who I did Red Eye last night with? 
[00:43:00]  You'll know who he is.  Buzz...  Buzzy...  Aldrin?  Yeah.  Buzzy, yes.  Buzzy, Aldrin, Buzzy.  Yeah, and Neely and Mikey couldn't make it.  It was just Buzzy.  My fraternity brother?  No, Buzzy.  No, Buzzy.  No, Buzzy.  Buzzy.  From the Melvins.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was on remote, but he was cool.  I'll be honest.  Being a huge Nirvana fan, I should know more about the Melvins.  I don't know much about those guys.  How's Buzzy, though?  He was cool.  He had this crazy wig on, but Greg just told me he's like... 
[00:43:30]  Cobain used to be there.  He's basically the guy.  The Melvins basically started that whole fucking thing.  It wasn't for the Melvins, I don't think you get Nirvana, which leads to everything else.  Some people would say, sure.  Yeah, I've heard that...  Smart guy?  I don't know anything about him.  It's hard to say because he was on remote, but he was obviously aware of what's going on.  But had he been...  Probably more conservative than a lot of people would think.  Really?  But had he been in studio, it would have been easier to gauge.  It's hard on remote because you've got that millisecond delay.  That fucks everything up. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  But he seemed like a nice enough guy and he was...  Yeah, I don't even know any Melvin songs.  I don't either.  I would love to hear one.  I've been curious ever since last night.  Oh, by the way, the big giveaway continues today.  Oh!  And I gave away my ACDC thing to Derek because he deserved it and he wanted it.  But I have...  This is the big one.  My Kyocera...  Fuck.  ...digital camera.  Fuck.  And when you turn it, it looks like a credit card, but half of it folds forward or back 
[00:44:30]  so you can aim it like a video camera.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a brand name, too.  And...  ...in the Philippines.  That's right.  And, uh...  Where do you think you got that?  Gift?  I bought it.  Oh, you did?  I did.  I bought it a number of years ago.  I never used it?  No, no.  But it's funny.  There was, like, two little SD cards.  The one that's in it is blank.  And I had another one.  I'm like, let's see what's on this one.  Uh-oh.  And, uh...  Whoa!  Glad we didn't give that one away. 
[00:45:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Picture of a girl pissing in the parking lot.  Uh...  That's how shit gets out there.  Personal...  I know, believe me.  Like, oh, fuck.  I can't give that one away.  Wow.  2003, I got this camera.  Seven years old.  In amazing condition.  I still have the box and everything.  Uh...  I want $3,000 for it.  It's, uh...  Four...  Count them.  Uno, dos, tres, cuatro...  Pixels de mega.  Jesus.  Four megapixels. 
[00:45:30]  Pixels de mega.  Well, thank God technology doesn't really go forward that much from 2003.  It hasn't really advanced.  Oh, no, it has, actually.  Well...  Oh, literal, Jimmy.  Speaking of technology, it's a very, very sad day for me.  Uh-oh.  Droid.  I'm going droid.  You're going droid?  I've made my decision.  Stop.  I've made my decision, Jimmy.  Oh, you're getting away from AT&T, though.  Uh...  Okay, I'll respect that. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, then I'll make an AT&T phone?  I hope not.  You're looking for AT&T.  Because that's such a fucking hassle to change all that shit around, too.  The torch is, um...  A bust.  The iPhone killer's a bust.  Of course it is.  The Gizmodo, uh, is announcing that BlackBerry torch now available at half price after bad  sales.  Holy shit.  Damn.  50%.  Holy shit.  Whoever is running BlackBerry should be fucking fired. 
[00:46:30]  Because they are bums.  50% off after a week?  All us BlackBerry users were really excited that they were finally going to step it up.  They're not.  And now with this news that they're selling them for half price after bad sales, I am  officially done with BlackBerry.  Dude, you gotta be.  They stink.  And I'm in the market for a new fucking smartphone.  And I will go...  I will only go iPhone after I, uh, exhaust all the other possibilities.  Do you know what I found?  I have two...  I have the BlackBerry Storm, and I have the one before that, which is a much smaller BlackBerry, 
[00:47:00]  which has, like, a little screen on it.  Oh, I had that for a while, too.  That was a nightmare.  But, dude, that is actually a great phone.  Yeah.  Like, and I factory reset both of them yesterday, and I forgot how fucking good that BlackBerry  Verizon phone was to make calls on.  Just as a phone, right.  I may get that just as a number.  With the small one?  With the two letters on each, you double-click the text?  Yeah, that was a pain.  To text, it was a nightmare, but to make calls, it was a nightmare.  I had that, actually, and then I had to bail and get the bigger phone.  Was it the Pearl, right? 
[00:47:30]  Was it called the Pearl?  No.  I forgot.  Oh, you know what?  You might be right.  It might be, yeah.  I wore it as a necklace.  And that's the one with the sliding-out keyboard thingy.  Well, the torch, yeah.  No, no, no, the torch.  The one that's half off now.  That's the one with the slider.  No one wants those anymore.  Who the fuck designed that thinking, in this day and age of touchscreens, we're going to  have a phone with a slide-out keyboard like it's five fucking years ago?  When you see 50% off, usually you're very excited, but look at how awful that looks on 
[00:48:00]  the screen.  BlackBerry torched $9,800 at half price after only one week with a big 50% off sticker right  in the middle of the story.  That is horrible news for BlackBerry.  BlackBerry is embarrassing itself.  What an embarrassing company.  Thank God.  Wow.  I actually, for the first time in my life, I sat back because I wanted to be the first  at the cell phone store.  I got a guy, and I was going to run over there and get my torch.  I said, you know what?  Something doesn't sound right about this whole fucking thing.  I'm going to just sit back for a few days, and I'm glad I did now, because a week later, 
[00:48:30]  half off because of bad sales.  I don't see how RIM bounces back from that.  I mean, this is...  That's a tough one.  They're so late to the game already.  In the cell phone world, that is horrible news.  People aren't going to be running to the cell phone stores to get their half off fucking  BlackBerry torch.  Keith, the cop has a storm.  I'm like, what are you doing?  A click, click, click, click, click.  It's like punching a bay window.  A click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  We constantly were ragging him about his stupid phone. 
[00:49:00]  Dude, it makes me angry how lousy BlackBerry has responded to this.  It's like, just make a touchscreen like the iPhone.  Stop trying to be different because you're afraid of being a follower.  What a lousy fucking job.  They think because BlackBerry has always been the phone with the fucking keypad,  with real keys, and that's kind of distinguished them from the multitude of touchscreen phones  out there.  But, fuck, what are you doing?  Yeah.  It's like they're still trying to sell you a tube TV.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, accept it.  Nobody wants that shit anymore.  The Nagel vision.  Nagel Tron.  Nagel Tron, right.  They don't have a droid for AT&T, though?  Yeah, they do.  Someone is saying that it's not their best phone, though, the one they have for AT&T.  Well, that's the thing.  The droid is an operating system, not a piece of hardware.  Yeah, I got it.  So, you know, it's installed on all sorts of different phones.  So you can get a good droid phone and you can get a bad droid phone.  Just because you have a droid doesn't necessarily mean that you have an awesome phone.  And someone said the AT&T isn't their favorite droid phone.  Fuck. 
[00:50:00]  I got to change carriers and all that shit.  And then if you got time left on your...  Do you have contract time left over?  I don't know.  Where it's like, ah, fuck.  It's 200 bucks down the shitter.  I don't even know about that.  Those contracts are sickening, too.  Yes.  Let me say hi to Brian in Chicago.  Brian!  Hey there, Brian.  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Before I start off talking about my droid phone, I want to preempt it with, I'm not bashing  the fucking iPhone, okay? 
[00:50:30]  But?  The only reason why I don't have an iPhone is because I refuse to go to AT&T.  If I had it on Verizon or Sprint, I'd only have one.  That being said, I do agree with the person who said that AT&T's droid phone is not their  best, if Danny would, please, if you would check out the Sprint Samsung Epic 4G and go  ahead and rip on the Epic part of it.  That's fine.  The Sprint Samsung Epic 4G is, hardware-wise, probably, it's been rated the top hardware for 
[00:51:00]  a phone running the droid operating system.  Right.  Well, the Samsung Captivate, that's pretty sweet.  Yeah.  The Samsung Captivate is pretty sweet.  Seriously, or are you just fucking with me?  No, I'm not fucking with you.  So why are people having a problem with the AT&T droid phone?  Well, this person does.  I don't.  Do you want it?  You want a touchscreen, Danny?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like iPhone touchscreen?  You have to be these days.  One of the problems with the droid phone on AT&T is that it's a little bit small, and 
[00:51:30]  it doesn't have a flash for the camera.  It doesn't have a flash for the camera?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Which one are you talking about, dude?  I'm all about a camera with a flash and good video.  That's all I care about in the end.  And, dude, the Storm had that.  Like, they had...  I think they have a camera flash.  First of all, BlackBerry's menus can eat my ass.  A little menus, menu, menu, submenu, menu.  We get it.  Menus.  But their video, they had video. 
[00:52:00]  Well, like, had they done the right thing with the touchscreen and stopped being such  cocksuckers, they could have really hurt the iPhone because they would have had stuff  that the iPhone didn't have.  They're just dummies.  Tried to set themselves apart from the iPhone.  We're not the touchscreen guys.  We're the keypad guys still.  And what do they have?  Like, menu, submenu?  Fucking horrendous.  How fucking old of a concept is that?  You hit an app, you're rocking.  Dude, they're a terrible...  Whoever's running BlackBerry should be absolutely, I would say, assaulted sexually and then fired. 
[00:52:30]  And I heard the rumor that the phones were going half price, but now I see it that, no,  this is happening.  Amazing.  The torch is a bust and now they're selling them at half price.  It sounds to me like the torch is, the flame on the torch is not quite where they thought  it was going to be.  Thank you, Brian.  Thank you, sir.  All right, brother.  All right, everyone's talking phones now, but I mean, that's the headline there.  BlackBerry Torch is a fucking bust.  I'm so glad I didn't run to my store to get this thing. 
[00:53:00]  How fucking embarrassing.  Imagine what that meeting was like when they were all called in thinking like, all right,  what do we do?  So, uh, we got to cut this by 50%.  And then they had the guy that thought up the torch sitting there just knowing his job  is gone.  Heads are going to roll, my friends.  Everyone's talking about their phones now.  Yeah.  Look, it's, you know.  The phone argument is like politics or sports teams.  Yeah, we've done this a million times. 
[00:53:30]  But the headline today, the torch is not looking good for BlackBerry.  I just wish Carlin was alive right now because how much he would hate the country for talking  about their phones so much.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He probably would.  He would have a nice rant on that.  That would drive him nuts.  Uh, Sam brought it to my attention today that Mr. Ass is in a bit of trouble.  What?  Sam is all about the wrestling guys.  And before you change the channel, this is something that I think is pretty fucking good. 
[00:54:00]  Facebook is getting a lot of people in trouble.  You can't be running around cheating with this Facebook and this Twitter and everything  else, man, because these women are just, they can't wait to get on Facebook and say  they sucked your dick.  Well, here's our wrestling correspondent.  And Mr. Ass is in deep trouble because of Facebook.  What?  Had a bit of an affair.  Had an affair.  And the woman decided, I need to be on Facebook telling the world that I've been sleeping with 
[00:54:30]  Mr. Ass.  Well, yeah, I got to.  So this should be a lesson for everybody out there.  Not a lot of people have heard this.  But what about the people that don't really know who he is?  Well, he's always been known as an ass man.  Really?  Yeah.  A what?  I'm a nice man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm an ass man.  Are you?  At least it was a girl.  Yeah.  I just want to hear what he does with some asses. 
[00:55:00]  He's got a whole bunch of stuff that he does.  Does he do a few things?  He likes to.  Oh, he loves to love him.  Yeah.  Kick him.  I love to shove him.  Shove him.  I love to stick him.  Stick him.  Yeah.  Walk him.  I love to watch him.  Take a look, yeah.  Pick him.  Pick him.  I don't know.  Kick him.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's an ass man.  All right.  Yeah.  Very good.  So what the fuck?  Well, yeah.  I got a phone call last night telling me that I should check out this YouTube thing. 
[00:55:30]  A phone call?  Yeah.  This is very cryptic.  Yeah, it's very, it was an inside source because the wrestling websites have a prime  time, Sam Roberts.  I have an anonymous little source.  Yeah.  I bet it was like Andre the Giant calling.  No, it wasn't him.  But anyway.  And yeah, so I guess Mr. Ass, he's married, but he's been seeing this girl who's Canadian, 
[00:56:00]  I think maybe in Montreal or somewhere in Canada.  Uh-oh.  And I guess it's...  She wasn't hiding in a closet, was she?  No.  Inside joke.  Oh, those Canadians.  Yes.  But this girl decided to post pictures on Facebook of the two of them canoodling, just  tons of pictures, some of them very casual, others like kissing on the cheek, very flirty,  like boyfriend-girlfriend type of pictures, tons of them.  Good gosh!  That's right. 
[00:56:30]  And then his wife saw them on Facebook, Mr. Ass' wife, and so Mr. Ass called this girl  to say, what are you doing?  Why would you do this?  Exactly.  And the girl said, oh, I'll record all the phone conversations.  And put them on YouTube.  And then put them on YouTube.  Well, record the wife?  No, no, no, not the wife.  Just, uh...  The girlfriend.  Mr. Ass and the girlfriend.  Oh, my God.  But was the girlfriend having a problem with Mr. Ass?  Well, she...  Why would she do this?  She got a text message that he claims he never sent, thinking that it was over. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, really?  And so she decided, well, if it's over, I'm gonna...  Then I'm gonna do all this.  ...ruin everything.  I'm gonna ruin his fucking life.  Not only that, here's what...  It's the bitches that'll ditches.  Here's what probably also happened.  Mr. Ass probably was talking to this chippy and saying things like, no, I'm leaving her.  Don't worry.  Yeah, no, no, it's over between us.  Don't worry.  You're my girl and stuff.  And then when that doesn't happen, and he gets mad because there's canoodling pictures  up, she probably, you know, the woman scorned. 
[00:57:30]  What a dummy.  She fucking just ruined his life to be a cunt.  And of course she saved all the text messages and sent his wife all their text messages.  It's a big new thing to do.  You record people.  You fucking get the texts.  You keep everything, pictures, and then you just fling it all on the fucking net when  things go south.  That's right.  Ugh.  Women are fucking dirty, man.  They're dirty.  Has there been a case of guys, like, being bitches like this?  No.  In a high profile kind of celebrity thing?  No.  It's the bitches that'll get you.  It's a woman thing to do. 
[00:58:00]  You don't ruin lives.  It's just like fucking yay.  No, it's the...  It's the new thing to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's some of the messages?  Because we live in a world where everybody wants their fucking fame now.  So now this is a way to get famous.  A woman used to have to hire a private dick to go over to the house with big pictures  and a fedora.  Yeah.  Ah, you want to see these pictures?  Nah.  Yeah.  And they want to look.  So let's get into this.  Mr. Ass calls the girl after his wife sees the pictures on Facebook. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, there's really...  Can we see the pictures on Facebook?  No, you go to the YouTube.  If you go to YouTube and type in Kip Part 1, or Kip Part 5 will be the best one.  Yeah.  Kip Part 5?  How many videos did she make?  Oh.  It might be two Ps.  All right.  But there's like six parts.  She posted 40 minutes worth of...  Phone calls?  Yeah.  Oh.  Well, and Sam went through all the phone calls so you don't have to deal with this shit on  YouTube.  Wow.  The best stuff. 
[00:59:00]  And the YouTube videos that she put, the stills that are over the audio are the pictures  that she posted on Facebook.  Jesus Christ.  For whoever this is.  Now there should be a comma in the whole thing.  I'm an ass, man.  Get it?  Rodney Dangerfield said a great joke about that.  Really?  He goes, yeah, some guys are leg man, breast man, ass man.  I'm an ass man.  I walked out to see people like, you're an ass, man.  Oh, you did.  I'm Rodney's voice.  I'll tell you. 
[00:59:30]  Classic.  All right.  It starts with a Mr. S calls a girl after his wife sees the pictures on Facebook.  What's up?  Hi.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You got me divorced.  Thanks.  I appreciate that.  What do you mean?  I didn't get you divorced.  Because I would do that to you.  You're the one who told Mike you never wanted to talk to me again.  No, that's not what I said.  Well.  I would talk to you when I got there.  No.  From what I heard, it's like.  Okay.  Okay.  You're a fucking lunatic. 
[01:00:00]  You're a fucking psycho path.  And now you got me to fucking talk to me for no reason at all.  And then you took all this shit on fucking Facebook.  And you did it the fuck off.  Why?  Who saw it?  What do you mean?  I'm fucking sorry.  What do you mean?  I'm sorry.  Don't be fucking stupid.  Well, I blocked all the wrestlers from seeing it.  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, fuck.  I blocked everybody.  I fucking saw it.  Except who? 
[01:00:30]  Except my fucking wife.  I saw it.  Oh, okay.  Why?  What did she say?  Oh, God damn it.  Oh, I hate this woman.  I hate this fucking girl.  I really hate this woman.  I hate this fucking cunt.  You knew exactly what you were getting into when you decided to fucking sleep with Mr. Ass.  What a vindictive cunt.  Oh, my.  You knew exactly what you were doing with the ass man.  He loves to kick them.  Oh, this guy's in hell.  Stick them.  Stick them.  You find it on YouTube, Denny?  God damn.  Unbelievable.  I love when this happens. 
[01:01:00]  Everyone is searching based on what you said, Sam.  And listen to this.  Kurt in North Carolina.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, what's up, buddy?  Hey.  Hey, I searched for Kip Part 5, and it brought up the first video is the 2010 Michigan Corn Growers Association  and Pioneer Hybrid Kip Colors Part 5.  You cocksucker.  What's wrong with you?  I just said that this is not very viewed.  You have to actually search for it.  Obviously, I found it. 
[01:01:30]  You're not listening to the audio of what you just said.  I cannot believe that you would fucking do that.  You were the last person I thought that ever would fucking do that to me, and you fucking did it.  Well, I was hearing that you're, like, done with me and all that.  Well, what the fuck?  You're acting like a fucking crazy person.  And then I got it in a text message from you, too, saying that we're done. 
[01:02:00]  So I was like, well, why does it matter?  Who the fuck said that?  I just fucking said that.  I have it in a text message from you.  It ain't worth it from me.  Well, you could have called me and let me know that.  Yeah, but goddamn fun.  I can't call you from my fucking phone.  She told me not to fucking call you from my fucking phone.  I told you.  I was fucking talking to you when I got there.  But that wasn't good enough for you.  So now you fucking accomplished what you accomplished.  You fucked up my fucking, fucked my whole fucking life up.  Now I'm fucked. 
[01:02:30]  Why?  I didn't know that.  Thank you for fucking my whole life up.  Thank you for that.  This broad is really sick.  She's a piece of shit.  Because you got to.  She sounds cute.  You got to remember, these phone calls could have been just between, you know, them,  and she decided to put the phone calls on YouTube as well.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  You'd ruin your life for her.  Dude, she is kind of cute, though.  Oh, but look at her dumb fucking.  I mean, it's like a mind-boggling why a chick would just do this and go public with it.  What a cunt.  Right.  Cunt!  What a cunt. 
[01:03:00]  Who's that?  His wife?  Huh?  No, that's her.  She went.  She's one of those chicks who had a hundred different hair colors.  She hates herself as she should, I'm sure.  Look at Billy Gunn, though, man.  Yeah.  Missed her ass.  He's smooching.  Missed her ass.  He's getting some smooches.  That's a damaging picture.  That's not that damaging, though.  She could just be a fan of the signing.  That's a little damaging.  There's a lot.  She must have gone to a lot of the signing.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's not bad looking at all, man.  Yeah, she's cute.  What's the rest of her body look like, though? 
[01:03:30]  She's like a fucking iceberg.  She's probably in good shape.  No, enough for him.  Or it's good all the way down.  Yeah, that looks so far.  Sometimes it's not good all the way down.  So far, it's looking good.  Sometimes you get to the waist, and then all hell breaks loose.  Well, he was dumb to let them be photographed that many times.  A lot of these look like they could just be fan pictures.  Like other people taking pictures.  On one of the videos, one of the pictures is him in his underwear laying on the bed eating  McDonald's.  Almost looking like Hasselhoff, except in his underwear.  Yeah.  Oh, that might not be a fan picture.  Oh, ass man. 
[01:04:00]  What have you done?  Oh, yeah.  And look at this.  This is the picture.  She took pictures of his text messages and put them on YouTube.  I like how she used Microsoft Paint to make a little note.  She wanted to ruin them.  She's a piece of shit.  She's a piece of shit, right?  Yeah.  She knew exactly what she was getting into, man.  What a piece of shit.  Well, the phone calls continue.  I locked myself in the house until the police showed up here, and it was embarrassing.  I guess this needs a setup, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:04:30]  I was going to say.  What was that noise?  Is that a kid?  I think that's her kid.  Of course.  What had happened was, at one point in the phone conversation,  her ex came in and started yelling over the phone,  I'm going to kill you.  And then Billy Gunner was like, you know, shut the fuck up.  Just stop it.  Yeah, bring it.  And so then.  The music started, right?  Yeah, exactly.  And it was a big fucking.  Why is the ex getting involved, though?  Yeah, I guess he's a crazy guy.  I don't know.  He just said, don't talk to my ex like that.  And then she calls up to say that the cops came,  and she's trying to convince him to press charges against her ex. 
[01:05:00]  And he's like, no.  Why would I care?  Or I'm on the plane going home, but wish I was staying with you.  Love ya.  That's from him.  And then she writes, he said it first.  Right, because he said I didn't.  She said you loved me.  And then she goes, yeah, well, I like you more, so I win.  Oh, boy.  No, you're the best.  I win.  I think, you know who loses?  Us.  Reading that.  Horrible texting.  But again, that's not, by the way, 
[01:05:30]  her photographing that is not proof that it's actually him,  because it's his name coming up that she entered.  Right.  Oh, but you know who it is.  Of course it is.  And you got his voice talking to her.  Yeah.  I mean, she's all in.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt that those are his texts.  She's all in as far as destroying his life.  Yeah.  Like, I lost myself in the house until the police showed up here.  And it was embarrassing, because one of the police officers  has already been to my house because of my ex. 
[01:06:00]  Okay, well, I don't care.  I don't know if you know this or not, but I don't care.  Because I fucking wish you to beat your fucking ass.  You what?  I wish you to beat your fucking ass.  You wish you to beat my fucking ass?  Yeah.  Well, because you ruined my fucking life.  That's why.  So domestic violence solves everything?  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.  Why would you fucking ruin my fucking life?  I didn't ruin your life. 
[01:06:30]  Just be deep, goddammit!  What the fuck?  Love this guy.  I didn't ruin your life.  Oh, goddammit.  You are fucking so delusional.  I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.  You think she heard the Mel Gibson tapes and said, you know what?  I got a situation, too.  I'm inspired.  That I could take advantage of.  How new are these?  I mean...  Text messages from May, so...  Yeah, these tapes are pretty new.  I don't know exactly when the phone conversations take place,  but they have not been on YouTube long. 
[01:07:00]  Nobody's picked up on them, man.  I'm so glad that we're helping it along.  Now I feel like a fucking dirtbag.  They're going to.  They're going to anyway?  All the sites are...  Thanks, Sam Roberts.  You ruined my fucking life.  Everything was cool.  I actually got it settled, no problem,  and you put it on this radio show.  I wish Jimmy would kick your fucking ass.  Oh, boy.  What's that picture?  Yeah, see...  See, that's not a fan picture, Jimmy.  Oh, no. 
[01:07:30]  He looks like he's pretty much passed out in bed with her.  Oh, no.  They were eating McDonald's together.  That's very, very...  Who took that picture?  Could you go back a little bit?  Did she take that, or did he?  Is it arm's length?  Yeah, I can't see her arm.  That looks like her.  She took that.  Yeah, she took that.  Of course she did.  Wow.  Oh, fucking horrible.  Oh, boy.  Who do I want to fuck her?  All right, here we go.  Young whore.  Phone calls continue.  I'm sorry, Kip.  No, you're not fucking...  Yes, I am sorry.  I'm saying that, because you're not fucking sorry. 
[01:08:00]  Not sorry.  You're a fucking piece of shit.  Thanks.  Yeah, exactly.  Because I was fucking nothing but fucking nice to you.  No, you turned your fucking back to me.  I always was like, shut the fuck up!  I was always fucking nice to you.  I always treated you with respect.  Everybody in that fucking town fucking hates you.  They think you're the biggest fucking slut and piece of fucking shit on the fucking planet.  And if you don't think that's true, you're really delusional. 
[01:08:30]  But you know what?  I never fucking said nothing about that.  I fucking took you at face value.  I fucking let you fucking do what you want.  I fucking...  You fucking never listened to nothing I say.  And you fucking ruined my life.  I didn't ruin your life.  That's your thing.  That's your thing.  God damn it, fucking Debbie.  Holy shit.  Fucking Debbie.  She sucks.  You did, fucking Debbie.  She does suck.  She sucks because, once again, she knew what she was getting into. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, exactly.  So what are you doing, man?  It was what it was.  And you fucking now decided to destroy the guy's life?  Plus, it's not even like she just sent it to his wife.  He's a public figure.  Yeah.  And she put it on YouTube.  Right.  Like any search of Billy Gunn.  Yeah.  That's the most embarrassing one.  He's wearing a little bunny rabbit or kitty hat.  Kitty hat.  Pink kitty hat.  Almost looks like a hello kitty thing.  And there's a cheese doodle in his mouth or a pretzel or something.  There are a lot of pictures where it's like his eyes are glazed over. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, it looks like the old Billy Gunn likes to toss a few back.  And what, he likes going to Canada a lot?  Does he wrestle in Canada?  Yeah.  On a regular basis or something?  I guess so.  Is he still wrestling?  Yeah, but doing like, you know, shows in gyms and stuff.  Is he as big as he used to be?  No.  Oh.  I'm doing play-by-play first matches.  Do you know him?  No, not really.  Have you met him?  I've met him.  Yeah, his career is on the outs.  Yeah, on the outs there.  One more clip.  You know what?  Don't even fucking trust about what you did because you can. 
[01:10:00]  You're a fucking lunatic and you're fucking bipolar and you're fucked up.  I'm not bipolar.  You are fucking bipolar.  You're fucked up.  Oh, you're the one who loves me one moment and then you hate me the next.  And I even have it in the text messages.  Oh, I know.  Goddamn, you've met every goddamn one of them.  What the fuck?  Then you're the one that's bipolar.  No, I'm still shit.  No, I'm not bipolar.  I'm just fucking fucked up.  On your fucking pills. 
[01:10:30]  Okay.  You already fucking know that.  Oh, I can't even paddle because you'll get another wrestler on pills.  She's just trying to drag.  Yeah.  She dragged him.  Are we going to make it 90 days?  She knew.  Are we going to make it 90 days?  Oh, not Billy Gunn.  No, not the ass man.  He's actually deep into his 40s, so he'll probably make it.  Yeah.  He just got to get out of his 40s.  Yeah.  I can't even paddle because you'll get so fucked up on pills, I threw out my back again 
[01:11:00]  trying to help you walk.  Okay.  So what?  You're so...  You know what?  If you didn't want to fucking do it, walk the fuck away and get the fuck away from me.  No, because I have to help you because when you're up here, it's like...  No, you don't have to fucking help me.  Yeah, it's like you because people are worried.  Like, I have your friends to help you to make sure he's breathing, to make sure he's breathing.  I don't give a fuck.  When you go to bed.  I don't give a fuck.  Wow, this is a great insight to these fucking wrestlers. 
[01:11:30]  They used to be huge.  Make sure you're breathing?  That's good.  And she knew that she was recording.  She was just trying to get him to give as many embarrassing details as he could.  Yeah, totally baited him to talk about the pills.  So she could put it on YouTube.  Great.  Wow.  What a sickening hunt.  She really is horrible.  That is just...  What is that about?  It's funny how YouTube won't take that off.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Hope he's video gets him in trouble because he makes fun of a fat girl.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:12:00]  Doesn't make any sense.  None.  I need a big wig at fucking YouTube.  I need to...  A genuine giant wig.  Yes, yes.  A guy with a big fucking wig.  I want the big wig to have just a big wig.  Let's do that.  Mike in Queens.  Mikey.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to make a comment about this fucking cunt.  It goes back to what Patrice was saying.  No, it's really his fault, man.  It's Billy Gunn's fault.  Pretty much. 
[01:12:30]  He didn't straighten this bitch out before we got that point.  Straighten this bitch out.  I think this is happening a lot now.  Oh, yeah.  Because I think the rules have changed.  Now women are using all this to get a little fame for themselves.  Yeah, pretty much.  She was the second bitch, so come on.  What the fuck?  This is something that's happening, and it's really exposing guys for what they are and  women for what they are.  Guys, if they have this attraction to a woman, it goes beyond just fucking, they will start 
[01:13:00]  trusting a lot and sending texts and pictures, never thinking shit's going to end.  It's almost like a little mini marriage that goes on.  Like, but marriage itself, the guy realizes, oh, everything's great, the honeymoon, this  is wonderful, and then a few years later, you're like, who the fuck is this bitch I'm  married to?  And then you break up.  With this, you have this little relationship going on with pictures and texts and cutie  little things.  And then before you know it, that's over. 
[01:13:30]  And like a mean, nasty divorce that happens in a court, this is played out in front of  fucking people with harsh shit and pictures and all this bullshit and phone calls.  It's amazing what has happened these days.  All it takes is one Facebook update.  That's it.  One Facebook update, and you're fucked.  Right.  That's all it is now.  It's indicative of all cunts.  What?  It's indicative of all cunts.  What?  Dicative.  I don't know if you're making sense.  Indicative of all cunts. 
[01:14:00]  How does that help the discussion?  That doesn't.  Unplug it.  What are you doing?  Unplug that damaging apparatus.  What are you doing, sir?  Oh, sir.  You had some good comments up to that.  Yes, yes.  I think in some of these cases, the guy is to blame, too.  I guess.  Yeah, that was the whole point.  Billy Gunn wanted, he heard the rumors that this hot piece of ass is a slut. 
[01:14:30]  So he said, look, I'm fucking addicted to pills.  My life is a mess.  I don't mind if I get a little peace when I'm in this area.  A little peace on the side.  I wonder what everybody was talking about.  Why does nobody like her?  Yeah, what the fuck?  That's weird.  No one seems to like her, but you know what?  I like her.  Oops.  And that's what happened.  He liked her.  He took advantage of the town slut.  She probably really kind of was into him because he was treating her nicely and shit like that  and not like the rest of the town does because she's a slut. 
[01:15:00]  You think she wanted more?  Oh, God, yeah.  She's a kid.  She doesn't understand that he's making terrible money now.  She knows he's a celebrity.  She wants to walk around town with him.  He's probably some dopey Canuck that dumped his awful Canadian load in her.  Hey.  Hey.  She said something French.  Hey.  Fucking fatten her awful pussy up.  She pumped that thing out.  You're kind of right.  When I was living in Buffalo, the Canadian girls had a little desperation to them.  Was it a little more desperate? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, they kind of wanted to stay over the border.  More desperate than the Buffalo girls?  What?  Yeah.  Wow.  Because at least the Buffalo girls were American.  Yeah, true.  I mean, when you live in Buffalo and some of these other towns and cities near the border,  you feel it.  You see, when you're interacting with the Canadian broads, they know there's a better life  a little south of where they live.  Just a couple of miles away.  I forgot.  Yeah.  There was a bit of desperation to them.  Just a little bit.  Well, just the fact that they were...  And they were a little sluttier, to be honest.  He's also an ex-wrestler.  They were taking up the poop chute a little easier than the Buffalo girls were. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, great as that.  Buffalo Betty's yuck.  Well, he's still a wrestler, right?  He's not even an ex-wrestler.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm sorry.  My fault.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And she's definitely what's referred to as a ring rat.  A ring rat?  Yeah.  Now, what does this mean, Sam?  It's like a wrestling groupie.  Ah, one that will fuck the wrestlers.  Right.  That just hangs around.  Fuck you by posting everything on Facebook.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's why it's called Facebook.  Face. 
[01:16:30]  Ah, come from Connecticut.  Says the ass man sounds like he's going to go Benoit.  Oh, I hope not.  Sounds like he could go Benoit on this girl.  No, he's going to be dead in a sad hotel room.  Oh, there's no reason.  If she's got to help him walk and watch that he's still breathing at night, that's not good.  Maybe he just likes to party.  Is his ass, with all the pills he's taking, is his ass holding up?  Oh, yeah.  He's still an ass man.  Is his ass just holding up, though?  That's great.  Shakes that thing around.  I don't know.  If you're having a problem walking, it doesn't... 
[01:17:00]  Still got to work that ass out.  Every time she called or he called her and she started asking those questions, he should  have just played the music over the phone.  Because I'm an ass man.  Bam, bam.  And she'd just be like, I have useless tapes of the ass man song.  But it's such a great song.  Of course it is.  Let's go to Steve in Jersey.  Steve.  Yes.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Steve?  I'm with a man called Jersey. 
[01:17:30]  Steve in Jersey.  Hi.  Yeah.  I can't hear you, sir.  You just started talking at the end of the laugh.  We didn't hear what you said.  We have an LOS here, sir.  We all right?  Yeah.  What the hell is wrong with this girl that, like, thinks that Mr. Ash is going to treat  her right, and fucking hell, all these girls are going to side with her and start recording  their own boyfriends.  Well, they are. 
[01:18:00]  Or not.  They are going to do that.  It's fucked up.  She's going to be seen as some sort of hero for being a stunt.  Is it a hindsight thing?  Like, when you listen to these recordings and go like, oh, my God, it's so obvious she's  baiting him with questions.  Or is it something that anybody could fall into?  Like, would you know if a girl was trying to bait you?  It didn't sound like she was baiting him, really.  It sounded like they were just having a conversation.  I don't know.  There was a couple of times, but it's hindsight now.  Yeah, I think it's hindsight.  I don't know what's being taped. 
[01:18:30]  But you're like, why did she say it like that?  She wants me to, like, she's trying to make me talk about the pills.  Plus, you get so mad, like, you're only thinking with your emotions.  Yeah, so you don't even.  Yeah, take the pills.  Oh, shit.  Shit, fuck.  You know how easy I would be to bait?  Really?  Oh, boy.  I hope my girlfriend doesn't have a recording device.  Oh, really?  So what?  I was going to let cum out of your pussy.  Well, there'd be no mincing words.  Yes, I prepped the bull for you.  Go ahead, you, sir. 
[01:19:00]  You go right ahead, sir.  And shut up.  This guy's chiming in.  We got rid of him.  Chiming.  We got rid of him.  I know it's hard on the phone, but fucking Christ.  When I backward milked to that gentleman for you.  Yeah.  How many people have jerked guys off into your face and licked it?  Not a lot.  Never happened, by the way.  Really did.  Because this could be recorded.  Yeah, this could be.  I don't know.  It just seems like you, especially if you know someone and have spoken on the phone 
[01:19:30]  with them a few times, you might notice a difference in what they're saying and how  they're saying it and shit.  But again, hindsight, who the fuck knows?  That's right.  You have to.  She probably moved on to another wrestler and said, all right, I'll fuck this guy's life  up.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  Maybe she's looking for the road dog, Jesse James.  X-Pac.  X-Pac, maybe.  X-Pac is around.  I'm thinking Bruno Sammartino.  It's like doing the X-Pac cross over the groin.  Bruno Sammartino.  Wow, that's gone old school.  Brian in Canada, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, dude. 
[01:20:00]  Hey.  Fucking guy wrestles up here in Winnipeg.  I can't believe Sam doesn't know this.  Look up WFX Wrestling.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  It's a little wrestling league up there?  So he's around a lot.  Listen, fucking, he works out at my gym.  My fucking grandfather can fucking, well, you know, the guy's, I guess he's fucking,  I don't know, I guess his body's rejecting him or something, but this WFX Wrestling, it's 
[01:20:30]  run by this fucking knob named Mike Davidson up here.  He's a nab.  A total tool.  Oh, yeah.  It looks Billy Gunn's up prominently.  And that Rupert guy from Survivor and the baggot-looking guy from Big Brother wrestles  in this league, it's just bush league, I'm telling you.  Well, we're looking at the webpage right now and I see, what was his name?  Gangrel.  Gangrel, the vampire-y guy.  And I see Billy Gunn is right up there. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, they come up here once a month or once every couple months.  And, uh, I guess, I guess they get, I guess the audience pops for him or whatever and  they get that rush still that, you know, they're a bit popular or something.  Maybe the girls like that shit.  I don't know, but.  He's still in good shape.  Billy Gunn's in way better shape than most of the older guys.  Yeah, they're, they're okay.  He's in good shape, but, but he's, uh, he's a fucking tool.  I hated Gangrel.  Did you?  Yeah, it wasn't a big Gangrel.  He had the ruffled shirt on and everything.  Yeah, I didn't really like him, that whole vampire thing. 
[01:21:30]  But you guys are passing over the fact that Rupert now wrestles from Survivor?  Well, I don't know if he's a manager or what.  He's the tie-dye guy from Survivor, if you know what I mean.  Yeah, yeah.  He's now a wrestler up in Canada?  Well, I guess they got fair play, so they gotta get Rupert involved.  Right.  Wow.  Do you know any of these other, other guys?  Larry Zabisco.  The former AWA champion, Larry Zabisco.  And how does Billy Gunn look in the gym?  Um, you know, I don't know.  Like, there's no way these guys... 
[01:22:00]  Is that one of the fucking, uh, Bushwhackers?  Yeah, we had him in studio.  Yeah.  Oh, Larry Zabisco, right?  Oh, he was not quite right either.  There's no way these guys are, um, are clean or anything, because the way they lift and  shit like that, like, how do they stay so big?  I can't understand it.  Oh, my God, Luke.  Bushwhacker Luke.  Oh, my God.  With his fucking head that has been cut so many times.  Yeah, he's got one of those old-school heads.  Wow.  He's an old-school head.  He does.  All the razor blade marks.  Look at them all.  I saw him at one of the fucking cons there at, uh, the Javis... 
[01:22:30]  Was it Javis Center?  Yeah, yeah.  And, yeah, you get up close, and his head has been cut thousands of times.  Because they used to wrestle, like, eight or nine matches a week, and they'd bleed every  single match.  Wow.  So those scars add up.  Yeah, Eugene comes up here, too, I think.  Yeah, that's...  Uh, Eugene did more.  He did more.  He's mentally challenged.  Right.  That they called out Linda McMahon for in the old...  Oh, right, right.  Well, now he's at the WFX.  Yeah.  How is he able to still use the name?  No, he'd look at the name closely. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, it's U-Gene.  Whereas in WWE, it was E-U-G-E-A.  I still bet McMahon's, like, working on that.  I bet he's working on getting him to take that fucking Eugene away.  But this guy that runs the league, his name's Mike Davidson, he should be on that roster,  too, somewhere.  But, uh, he considers himself like the, uh, McMahon.  He puts himself in every situation.  Oh, really?  He's trying to be the Canadian Vince?  He's in every picture, and he's just fucking putting himself over all the time. 
[01:23:30]  You know what, though?  Well, he's got a bunch of wrestlers we know, so he's doing something right as far as the  minor leagues of wrestling go.  He's got a pretty slick website there.  Winnipeg's always been a hot spot for wrestling, like Hugh.  Oh, I bet.  Vern Gagne.  Winnipeg.  Honest to God.  You don't have to convince me.  I was being sarcastic, asshole.  No, I know.  But duh.  I know.  But duh.  I know, eh?  Jesus Christ, Anthony.  Oh, wait.  Ass-Man doesn't go as Ass-Man? 
[01:24:00]  No, no, no.  Not allowed.  Billy Gunn, Badass Billy Gunn, Mr. Ass.  All those names are not our own by Vince McMahon.  He can't use Billy Gunn.  So he has to just use Kip?  Yes.  What's his real name?  It's Kip Sop.  Kip Sop?  Monty.  Well, I think Kip is like his nickname, but his name is Monty Sop.  And he goes by Kip.  That is the worst name anyone could ever have.  I'd rather be named Cum-Filled Sock Toes.  Kip Sop is a nicer name.  Cum-Filled Sock Toes. 
[01:24:30]  You're on the phone.  You went from Billy Gunn to Kip?  Monty, Kip, and Sop.  Can't use anything with ass in it?  No.  Not unless he's Ass-Kip.  Well, he should be Ass-Kip.  Yeah, but Kip is.  Ass-Kip.  Your name is Monty.  Monty.  It's better not if your name is fucking Monty.  Your last name is Sop.  That's ridiculous.  Boy, Vince just puts the chokehold on these motherfuckers when they leave.  Smart guy.  Forever.  You're not using it forever.  One more call, then we're going to move on.  Richie. 
[01:25:00]  What's up?  Morning, boys.  Richie.  What up, Richie?  Easy, simple situation.  Don't cheat, asshole.  Wow.  Well, yeah.  Calm down.  Jesus.  Take it easy there, fucking Father Rich.  Yeah, what's the matter?  Hey, Pope Rich.  Yeah, what are you, religious?  Yeah, there's a lot of, you know what?  You grab one of these chicks, let them blow you, and keep them moving.  Well, I would agree with you, but with the court system how it is, where a lot of guys  feel like they're completely fucked and can't fucking leave a marriage, you know, then  they're trying to do the right thing on the side. 
[01:25:30]  Staying with the marriage and then just taking care of fitness on the side.  If getting divorced was easy and the guy didn't get completely fucked in it, then I  would completely agree with you, Richie.  How many situations do you know work out that way?  None.  There's so many fucking, we see it all the time, guys that are in miserable marriages  and they're like, I can't get a divorce, I can't afford to get a divorce, but they  still have needs.  Cheaper to keep her.  Cheaper to keep her.  If you're getting into an argument with your girl you're cheating on, you just can never  get angry with them on the phone. 
[01:26:00]  You have to maintain a level head at all times.  Yeah, but after this Mel Gibson thing, oh, my God.  What?  I don't understand.  Just make me understand.  That's all I want from my fucking career is make me understand.  I listen to a lot of talk radio.  You never hear this on any other show where fucking callers just keep babbling.  Where is the plug?  I'm fucking kicking it out.  Where is it?  You can't do a talk show without the phone.  You can't.  No, you can't. 
[01:26:30]  There's eight of us here.  We can talk.  This fucking guy.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But make me understand.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Make me understand, Rich.  Again, you got it.  Oh, my God.  And then he doesn't even want to fucking.  What happens?  Are we real low in your phone or something?  We encourage it by not being harsh enough.  Holy shit.  Is it the screening process?  No.  Is it the volume?  Is it?  No, I'm just yelling everything out. 
[01:27:00]  All I'm saying is, is it us?  I don't hear it on any other talk show.  I know.  It's amazing.  It's stunning, Kenny.  Could I have tomato juice?  There's like professional radio out there.  It's smooth.  Two, please.  Two, please.  I think it's the screening process.  Get rid of Troy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think when Travis was on the phone.  Troy's got to go.  We didn't have any of these problems.  Yeah.  Sorry, Troy.  Tea Storm could work a fucking bank of phones.  Exactly.  He knew what he was doing.  That's why they call him Tea Storm.  Of course.  Because he stormed up the phone bank.  Telephone storm.  That's what the tea is for, everybody. 
[01:27:30]  Everybody thinks it's Travis.  Not true.  No.  Not the case.  Telephone storm.  He tore it up.  All right.  We'll step aside.  Well, I guess we fucked up ass man's life because no one was talking about this until  today.  A little more.  Way to go, fucking Sam.  We support the ass man in this.  Way to go.  I'm on the ass man's side.  Yes.  As far as this goes.  He's probably sitting around in Canada somewhere going, well, all right, it's on Facebook.  At least media's not picking up on it yet.  Then he tunes into Sirius XM. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, fuck.  Hey, Kip.  Just heard something on the radio.  They're talking about the tapes.  They're just playing them, eh?  Oh, fuck.  Well, this isn't the demo that would know who he is.  No.  And besides that, ass man is a regular talking point on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  So if there's something going on in the life of the ass man, that's the cost of being  a public figure.  I bet you, later on, if you tweet the ass man, or search the ass man, you'll see this conversation 
[01:28:30]  that we have had put in blog form, recordings, everything.  Today, Opie and Anthony show, they were talking about...  We just made it easier for every wrestling website that didn't want to, yes, to access  all of this.  Stay close to this one, Sam.  I don't know.  I will.  I think they'll do the right thing and let Mr. Ass Man, you know, slide on this one.  I hope so.  I don't think the wrestling sites will pick up on the fact that we talked about this. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, no.  You don't think so at all?  Give me a full report tomorrow.  Thank you.  Okay, I will.  I bet they will.  Poor ass man.  Let's go to Richie Boy.  Richie Boy.  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up, Richie Boy?  Hello.  Now, we're going to have a conversation.  Do you understand that much?  Oh, I'm with you guys.  Absolutely.  All right.  Now, you talk.  Yes, sir.  You know, it was said earlier that you've got to stay nice and you've got to be good  to your girl or to your mistress, even when you get bent out of shape. 
[01:29:30]  You've got to just stay nice.  Tiger Woods proved that no matter how nice you stay, you're going to get fucked anyway.  Because he never got angry.  I didn't hear any pissed off voicemails or see any text messages or anything.  They all just took the complete advantage of the guy.  You know, if you remember his voicemail, he was really nice.  Can you please?  Yes.  There was a please and a calm voice.  He also really racked up the numbers.  Yeah.  That's true.  Good point, Sam. 
[01:30:00]  What Tiger did was he didn't give them what they wanted.  That was what Tiger did wrong.  He was, he's one of the, he's not this ass man guy.  He's one of the most prestigious athletes on earth.  What do you mean?  He's worth at least a bit.  Easy on me.  Oh, okay.  Tiger's worth at least a billion.  Yeah.  You know how many times?  Safe to say the ass man might be worth $100,000 at this point.  You know how many times the ass man won the tag team belts and intercontinental title?  How many?  I've got to tell Mick.  Good, let him in Don Morocco, 69 down a water slide. 
[01:30:30]  Give a shit.  Over.  Yeah, I know.  Someone suggested.  K to K1, K to K12.  Vince and Bayonne, we're going to do the over thing.  I like your suggestion.  Some storm coming in, over.  Shut up.  He just can't wait to get that skinny kind off the phone.  Anything else, Mrs. Torrance?  Before your husband tries to kill you with an axe.  Anything else before you enjoy his novel?  I think Tiger, because of Tiger, it's a whole new world, though. 
[01:31:00]  Now the women know they can cash in on this bullshit by being slutty sluts.  First Tiger, then fucking Mel, and now all these chicks don't.  And now the ass man.  Now the ass man.  That's a hell of a drop off.  What do you mean?  Mel keeps it pretty high up, and then, oh boy, the ass man.  The ass man.  Mel doesn't have a song.  Mel's crashing cars now, though.  God bless him.  Oh, he certainly is.  What a mess Mel is.  Yeah.  Creshing his Maserati.  No one hurt. 
[01:31:30]  This is the best.  Peace out.  You didn't say over.  Over.  Over and out, if you're leaving.  All right, over.  Over and out.  All right.  It'll be 10-10-10-8 on the side.  Let's say hi to Devin in Canada.  CB lingo.  Got the Canadians checking in, because ass man is their own, basically.  He's wrestling up there.  What's up, Devin?  Hey, that other dude that called in said that Winnipeg was a big wrestling talent.  Totally.  Totally.  As Vern Gagne used to be up here all the time.  He made it pretty huge. 
[01:32:00]  But anyway, I'm out with my chick probably about six months ago.  And this guy walks up to her.  We used to allow just restaurant lounge or whatever.  Bunch of bunch of muscle heads walk in, kind of goofy looking guys, older looking dudes,  whatever.  And then through the course of the night, I guess, the ass man walked up to my girlfriend  and actually at one point said, I'm the ass man.  I guess he asked her her name or whatever, and she said, what's your name or whatever? 
[01:32:30]  And he says, my name's, I think he said Kip.  I'm not sure.  I don't remember.  But anyway, at some point, she kind of goes, oh, yeah, whatever.  And at some point, he goes, yeah, I'm the ass man.  And my girlfriend doesn't know shit about wrestling.  I love how he says ass man.  Ass man.  Ass man.  Very good.  I'll tell you, though, your phone sounds perfectly fine, by the way. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  Canadians talk a little slower.  Yeah.  They're a little more relaxed.  They talk a little slower, and there's a slight desperation in their voice.  Yeah, yeah.  They want to move south.  I also like that Billy Gunn introduces himself as the ass man instead of bringing up when he  was in the same-sex couple tag team, Billy and Chuck.  Yeah.  Oh, I forgot about that.  That's the one he doesn't bring up.  No, he doesn't bring that up.  Vince made him do that.  Yeah, that's the tag team that ended in a first man-on-man marriage on SmackDown.  Holy shit. 
[01:33:30]  And that was it for him.  Wasn't that how he went out, basically?  Oh.  More known as a homosexual tag team.  A homosexual.  Yeah, then he went over to TNA for a while, yeah.  Puddle of AIDS.  I'm writing.  This is because of you, Sam.  I'm writing a story on my stupid blog, TedWilliamsHead.com, right now as we speak.  Thanks, Samikins.  It's not me.  I'm just here to produce content for this show.  Sam's breaking news, man.  He's breaking the news.  I mean, it was just on YouTube.  It wasn't like somebody gave me these tapes. 
[01:34:00]  I'm a fan of Puddle of AIDS and what he does with that blog.  It's pretty good.  TedWilliamsHead.com.  Should get a plug today.  Writes about sports.  All the big sports stories and wrestling.  What do you mean, and?  So, I look forward to reading what he has to say about this whole thing.  Mentions the show a lot, too, so.  Why don't we go to break with...  Ass man.  Yeah, why not?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah, I'm an ass man!  Keep fucking that chicken. 
[01:34:30]  Keep fucking that chicken.  You had best to un-fuck yourself.  Hey, everybody!  We're all gonna get laid!  Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  He was bagging cocktail wages just two at a time.  Gay. 
[01:35:00]  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had,  and I've had him all over the world.  Oh, oh, oh.  Okay, faggot, what's next?  She was very badly raped, you see.  He said, I can smell your cunt.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  I'm a lover.  Don't you do it!  The best surprises always stick around.  And that's nothing but pure and simple old-fashioned communism. 
[01:35:30]  Happens every time one of those dancers start poontanging around with those show-book fans.  Knockers bouncing all over the junk.  Oh, my God.  The second verse sucks.  Get rid of this.  I know.  Goodbye.  We'll be back.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We love the all beyond you. 
[01:36:00]  Lands are green and skies are blue.  And all in all, we're just like you.  We love the all beyond you.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hola.  Michael Douglas throat tumor.  Full recovery, though, they're saying, for Michael Douglas. 
[01:36:30]  Don't the Hollywood people usually put out those statements like, yeah, it's not a problem.  Don't worry about it because they don't want some stigma on him.  And then like a month later, they're dead.  And then they're dead.  Dead.  Dead.  Yeah, they're saying he'll make a full recovery.  Yeah.  I wonder if he was a smoker.  I would imagine he smoked a few cigars in his day.  He looks like a cigar smoker.  Full recovery.  You know, Quincy made a full recovery, too.  But be tall like this.  Oh, you're thinking maybe it fucks up his voice a little bit. 
[01:37:00]  So it might fuck his voice up.  Jeez.  I'd like to hear a post-op conversation between him and his dad.  Oof.  A wreck.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no.  That's terrible, but...  Also, the Craigslist killer.  Yeah.  Who killed himself in jail in Boston, I guess, right?  Good.  Wrote ex-fian...  I love how this is put.  Wrote ex-fiancé's name in blood, slit wrists, and suffocated himself.  Shouldn't it be slit wrists and then... 
[01:37:30]  Then wrote...  Wrote ex-fiancé's name in blood, and then suffocated himself.  Wow.  He wrote Megan, because her name is Megan McAllister.  Right.  And pocket.  Pocket?  I'm guessing that might mean he had a note in his pocket, but then again, why wouldn't  he just put it on his chest?  I wonder what that means.  Just stab it right to your chest.  Unless that was a private thing for her, like a nickname for her, or...  You didn't have enough blood to write meat pocket?  Yeah.  Megan's a meat pocket.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Or pocketbook.  Yeah.  Why would I say this?  Why not?  I don't know.  He ran out of energy.  He was bleeding out.  He was bleeding and suffocating.  There was probably another word that was going to go with pocket.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  So, uh, we got that going on, which is nice.  Maybe it was, uh...  Oh, no, I fucked up.  Uh-oh.  What?  Hot pocket.  Maybe he wanted her to cook hot...  Her vagina reminded him of a hot pocket.  Hot pocket.  Because it was hot and cheese leaked out of it and broccoli.  Anthony might be on to something, because Cody in Indiana has a little something to add 
[01:38:30]  to the Michael Douglas tumor thing.  Go ahead, Cody.  I was looking through a stack of old entertainment weeklies in one of the articles, and it said,  Bernie Mac, age 50, is hospitalized with pneumonia.  His publicist expects him to make a full recovery.  Oh, and that didn't happen.  They always say that.  The publicist...  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  See, that's why we take phone calls.  Now, that was funny.  See?  I'll give him that.  Very funny, dude.  Yeah, Bernie Mac didn't make a full recovery. 
[01:39:00]  No, he did not do well.  A very talented motherfucker that went way before his time.  No, there's quite a few people that have...  I wish I could remember more, but their publicist said, yeah, no, don't worry.  It's fine.  Yeah, they gotta keep it all positive, right?  Full recovery is gonna be great.  My client has to keep working.  Oh, please.  Yeah, right.  And then they're dead.  Dead.  And then you got the German pop star.  You know anything about this one?  That's chicken.  Admits to hiding her HIV from the men she slept with. 
[01:39:30]  Oops.  Aww.  Oops.  And she's on trial.  Well, if you want to fuck, how do you come out and just say that?  You know, hey, I want to fuck, but, you know, that's something I gotta let you in on.  You might want to...  Huddle, huddle.  You might want to wear a bag.  What would he do in that...  You can get AIDS from a woman, but what kind of sex are they having when they're catching  the virus from her?  The one guy caught it from her.  A guy caught it from her?  Yes, he did.  Must have been very risky sexual activity, like ass sex. 
[01:40:00]  A lot of blood fluids flowing between the two.  A lot of tearing going on.  It's possible, I guess, but maybe she...  Can the AIDS go through the tip of your peepee and give you the AIDS?  Like menstrual blood?  Maybe she bled into his dick hole or something?  Oh, and then he had like maybe a little urinary tract infection, and it went in there.  Oh, that AIDS.  Maybe she'd bounce up and down on his wiener.  Let's see if she's worth having sex with, knowing she has fucking AIDS.  Let's take a look. 
[01:40:30]  A little too ethnic for me.  So not worth it.  A little too ethnic for me.  I would go a little ethnic, but nah.  You know how hot you have to be to be worth AIDS?  That's what I'm saying.  Who's worth AIDS out there?  Worth AIDS.  Scarlett Johansson.  Scarlett Johansson is worth AIDS.  Yeah.  Bury it fucking to the hilt in that ass, right?  I really would.  You're absolutely right.  I'd be mad if I didn't get AIDS.  Danny just found another picture that's brought, and she's not that bad.  That didn't look bad.  The second picture you showed us wasn't bad.  Ooh, third picture, not so much. 
[01:41:00]  Nice little stomach.  Not worth risking the AIDS.  We need a girl that's worth risking AIDS on.  All right.  Fourth picture, not bad.  Back in.  That's chlamydia.  That's worth getting chlamydia.  Right.  Something curable.  Risk chlamydia.  Maybe the herp.  That's all right.  You know what?  She might be worth AIDS.  Well, not worth AIDS, but worth the risk of.  A little nappy right there.  I'm not too happy with that photo. 
[01:41:30]  Did she say how she got the AIDS?  It's from somebody else that had AIDS.  From someone else that had the AIDS.  Thank you, Dr. Hughes.  It's, yeah, some unsafe behaviors.  I think it's pretty hard to get the AIDS through straight vaginal sex if the girl has the AIDS.  But, you know, I'm not saying go out and bang away with AIDS. 
[01:42:00]  But I think it's very difficult to get it that way.  Yeah.  Unless there's a good, this has to be the perfect storm, as they say.  Maybe you have a shanker on your cock.  You have a shanker.  The perfect storm is she has AIDS and the wind blows it into your dick.  That's the perfect storm.  It rains AIDS into your cock hole.  Tsunami of hiv.  Could she go away for life for doing this?  What's her, uh... 
[01:42:30]  I don't know what the penalty is.  I don't think it's life, but she can get yours.  If she ends up dying, she can go to jail for life.  Wow.  Really?  What country?  Germany.  Oh, Germany.  Has she had any hits that we know of?  Not that you guys know of, but apparently they're like the biggest selling girl band in German history.  Oh, wow.  Can we hear one of her songs?  Sure you can.  What is it, like, uh, the Spice Girls of Germany or something?  Yeah, it's pop.  He should have had gypsy tears.  Let's hear their biggest song ever.  It's a little layered. 
[01:43:00]  Check your alibi.  How poignant.  Yeah, the song is called Feel Good Lies.  Uh-oh.  Everybody tells a little story.  Everybody tells a wide lie.  Sometimes you gotta be careful.  If you fuck me, you're gonna die.  Better watch your back.  You gotta say what you say.  You gotta be careful, boy.  Everybody's got a little secret.  And mine is AIDS. 
[01:43:30]  That's really a big secret.  You really get a dear surprise.  Better watch your back.  Better watch her back.  Better run away.  I don't wanna play.  Better run away.  She was telling everybody.  There's a warning.  A lot of warnings in this song.  You gotta lose a lot of weight.  Oof.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Better check your alibi. 
[01:44:00]  When you look me in the eye.  You can't breathe good lies.  Better check your alibi.  When you fuck me in my brown eye.  Because you're gonna die.  I don't really give a damn.  I've been real good lies.  Yeah, that's just kind of saying it right there.  Yeah.  Wow.  And she's got HIV, not the AIDS yet.  Does anyone have AIDS anymore?  I think everyone just is HIV positive. 
[01:44:30]  Everyone's HIV positive?  Yeah, I think everybody's HIV positive.  Wow, that's a fucking bull statement.  It's a great book title.  We should play our...  Yeah, let's do it, Travis.  Come on.  Why not?  We're all thinking it.  Might as well play it.  Of course.  Faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted in a trial.  Everyone has AIDS.  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Goodness gracious. 
[01:45:00]  AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS.  Everyone has AIDS.  Don't stop tweeting a little.  So this is the end of our story.  And everyone is dead from AIDS.  No, she's dead.  Take it from me, my best friend.  My only true pal.  My only bright star.  He's not AIDS.  I'm gonna march on Washington.  Leave the fight and charge the brigades.  There's a hero inside of all of us. 
[01:45:30]  I'll make them see everyone has AIDS.  My father, AIDS.  My sister, AIDS.  My uncle and my cousin and her best friend.  The gays and the straights and the whites and the spades.  Everyone has AIDS.  Razzle-dazzle.  Yes.  That's fucking brilliant, man. 
[01:46:00]  Ah, is that a good one?  Bravo.  So we got that happening with that pop star.  Moving on.  You see the plane crash in Columbia?  Yeah, level one dead.  Fuck, that's amazing.  The whole fucking plane falls apart.  Yeah.  After being hit by lightning as it was landing.  They're lucky that thing was landing.  That fucking plane was in bad shape, man.  Came apart.  Yeah, everyone would have died on that one.  How do planes ever fly in clouds if lightning can do that? 
[01:46:30]  It's not supposed to do that.  It must have been so close to the ground that it fucking went through the plane and then hit the ground.  Oh, maybe.  Is that what they're saying?  It was 100 feet.  Yeah.  200 feet above, actually.  Yeah, that'll fuck you up.  So when it's in the air, you don't get hit by lightning?  No, you get hit by lightning.  You do, but it doesn't take the plane down.  Yeah, it's made so the plane can disperse the energy over its skin.  But if it goes through the plane and then hits the ground, then you're just part of the fucking circuit. 
[01:47:00]  You're like a fucking fuse.  Wow.  That's bad.  What, you got a fucking video of a plane getting hit by lightning?  Oh, look at that.  Wow, that's something.  That's pretty impressive.  Did that fuck the plane up at all or not?  Oh, it doesn't seem to.  It's not supposed to.  They're still watching their movie inside.  Planes have a lot of lightning strikes.  Everyone in that, we just watched a video of it.  Everybody on that plane is going, what the fuck?  They're all freaking out.  Oh, there's a lot of yelling on that plane.  Wow.  Where did they find that, man? 
[01:47:30]  Danny, send that to me.  I'll tweet that fucker.  Yeah, that one's up.  Oh, sorry.  That one's up on YouTube.  Yeah, fucking send that to me.  What a coincidence.  The guy's just videotaping it.  It's like, yeah, let me just watch this plane get hit by lightning.  Yeah, that's a lucky video right there.  They must have had a flyer about a clock tower.  Knew when it was going to happen.  Wow.  What?  You trying to freeze frame it?  Yeah.  But wait, there's a weird place in the back of the plane where the lightning comes out of it.  You see that?  Yep, yep.  Behind the plane, there's actually a spark that flies off.  It's gigantic.  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  What is that?  I don't know.  Why'd the spark fly off?  I have no idea.  What happened?  Pretty cool, though.  Slid off the top of the plane and came out the back.  I don't know, man.  That's impressive.  Is that a piece of the plane falling off?  No.  I don't think so.  What is it?  No, the plane landed safely as far as that goes.  Everybody was fine.  But the one in Columbia, one person died.  130 live in the plane.  Oceanic 815, that plane right there.  Just ripped apart, basically, as it was landing.  Wow.  Damn, that's a great video.  It's, it's, it's, it. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Goddamn, that's creepy shit.  You think they knew when they...  There you go.  Wow.  Danny got a good fucking...  Can you imagine sitting on the wing and that hit you?  Why would you be sitting on the wing?  Why not?  There's a man on the wing.  I swear there's a man on the wing.  Do you think everybody in the plane knew?  How could you not?  Or it was just kind of like, you know, you don't even know.  Just a flub.  Planes get hit by lightning all the time.  We're getting, uh...  Yeah. 
[01:49:00]  ...intel.  So, but I want to know if you feel it if you're in the plane.  That's a good question.  Yeah, if you're in the plane, what happens?  I mean, you're not feeling the actual lightning, but what are you feeling inside?  Or do you smell anything?  Something.  Yeah.  We got any fucking pilots out there?  Where's that lunatic pilot that used to call us?  And he had a pretty good fucking way about him.  Good sense of humor.  Oh, Mohammed A.  Where is he?  Oh, Jesus.  Where is he?  He's a call.  Let's go to Ray in Virginia.  You can call me... 
[01:49:30]  Ray, you can call me.  I'm from VA.  What's up, Ray?  Virginia.  Too bad he's not from B-O with an O.  Hey, Opo, I want to know if you're going to be eating shrimp now that the shrimping season  is back open in the Gulf.  I just heard about this.  Yeah, they're opening up the shrimping season.  People say it's safe, but a lot of shrimp is not going out.  What do you mean?  Do you fucking believe this?  They're saying it's safe?  I think what they're going to do...  Here's what I think, though.  I think a lot of shrimpers aren't going to go out and then sue the government and sue 
[01:50:00]  everyone else, sue the oil company, sue everyone, and try to get as much money as they  can.  If they go out shrimping and bring in shrimp, I think it pretty much negates any chance  of them suing.  Because, hey, look, you shrimped, you sold your shit.  If you don't go out, then I think you have a lot easier of a time suing.  I don't know how you eat the shrimp.  I know there's probably people that listen to this show and they depend on the shrimp  for their livelihood, but I'm not eating no fucking Gulf shrimp anytime soon. 
[01:50:30]  They just capped it a week and a half ago.  I know.  What happened to all the oil?  It went away.  Where are the experts telling us that the shrimp are safe?  And could you boil that shit out of the shrimp?  No fucking way, man.  Yeah, I don't think so.  You know, it's one of these things that the government tells you something and you wonder  who's paying who behind the screen.  Of course.  Are you all clear?  God bless you, Ray, for not just assuming everything they tell us is right.  They tested, I read something online, they tested nine shrimp and one trout. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, really?  They tested one trout.  One enough?  How many do you want them to test?  Ten?  Two trout?  Over the weekend, I had a chance to eat a little fish.  A little, what the fuck was it?  Salmon, even.  It was salmon.  That's right.  I'm on the edge of my seat.  How did it taste?  What a douchebag.  That's great.  Was it a flounder? 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, but go with, but I don't even know if the salmon are safe.  They swim upstream.  Fuck that, man.  I think they're fine.  My point being, I'm a little scared of seafood in general because of the oil spill.  I won't eat it.  What?  I ain't gonna eat that shit.  No?  How can you, how millions of barrels of oil are floating around in the water?  Right.  And these things are breathing, I mean, shit, how the fuck?  Yeah, I don't, I don't know.  I mean, how are we gonna figure out if they're really safe?  How is the mahi-mahi? 
[01:52:00]  Are we okay?  And how do we, how do we trust our government on this one?  King crab legs, you can have that.  What's Sam's dad gonna do about the sardines?  I love this great guy.  He knows everything.  Yeah, let's ask Sam.  Is Sam's dad eating some of the greatest treats of all time?  The buttermilk soaks up the oil, which is good.  He's got the perfect combination.  Are you eating shrimp, Ray?  Not at the moment.  Yeah, I know.  Where are we gonna get our shrimp from?  I love fucking shrimp, too, man. 
[01:52:30]  Literally, I love fucking them.  And then what about that, let's make you lobbying shit that goes on in the background where you  get some gulf shrimp and you put it over as some kind of Canadian shrimp or something.  Well, I think gulf shrimp in general suck.  They don't get the big ones, do they?  Gulf shrimp?  Yeah, aren't they the little fuckers that you get at Red Lobster?  The all-you-can-eat shrimp thing?  What are the big ones?  Black.  The black shrimp.  We should ask your brother, Oak.  I'll ask my fucking brother.  The restaurateur.  Oh, I was like, is the restaurant one or the marine biologist one? 
[01:53:00]  We don't serve a lot of seafood, though, in general, so I'm gonna ask my brother.  I want to know how we know the fucking seafood's safe.  Let's get the whole Hughes family on the floor.  All right, Ray, you fucking asshole.  Enough of you.  Let's just get them all in there.  All right.  Thank you, Ray.  Oh, thank you, boy.  He's so annoying.  I love him, though.  I don't know why.  I love him.  But he didn't know anything about the pilot, the flying.  What?  You asked him about flying and he started talking about gulf shrimp.  Oh, no, I just moved on.  I hope he gets electrocuted. 
[01:53:30]  Well, we can't just sit here and wait for the pilot to call.  We still gotta do a radio show.  And he brought up a good point because it is in the news.  They're going to start catching shrimp again in the Gulf.  And how do we know the shrimp is okay?  Yeah.  Can Fox stop trying to be different, by the way, and saying homicide bomber?  It's not catching on.  I just had to point that out.  It's the worst thing they came up with.  Homicide bomber.  Homicide bomber.  Just put bomber.  Because we want to put the attention on the people that were killed and not the bomber himself.  That's really bad. 
[01:54:00]  It's like, but it doesn't accurately depict what happened.  A homicide bomber is anyone that planted a bomb and fucking blew it up and killed people.  A suicide bomber is somebody that killed themselves while they were doing it.  There's a difference.  It's stupid.  Stop.  Just put bomber.  Yeah.  Bomber kills dozens and self.  That would be fine.  Homicide bomber.  Let's go to James in Canada.  Air traffic controller guy.  Let's do this, man. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  Tell us about the lightning hitting the planes in the air.  Good morning, boys.  How are you doing?  Hi.  Are you the guy that I was looking for?  Yeah, I was the guy that called in when your pilots in Minnesota went a little bit too long.  Yeah, I recognize your voice.  Yeah, you're the guy I like.  Go ahead.  Okay.  The theory is, have you ever drug your foot across the carpet and touched the doorknob?  Oh, it hurts.  Yeah.  Well, when you're in close proximity to the ground, the airplane is going through the atmosphere  and has a lot of static electricity built up to it.  When the lightning hits the ground, it sort of connects the static to the airplane and the 
[01:55:00]  lightning off the ground.  And then all the electromagnetic interference takes out all the instrumentation and boom,  cancel Christmas.  You're just guessing.  Isn't that what I just said?  Amazing.  And then in the air, you don't have anything to ground it to, so it's like birds on a  wire.  Therefore, you don't get any, it just, the electrons just peel off the back of the air.  I said that!  But what is the, but what is the distance between, like, what is the height? 
[01:55:30]  Because is it 100 feet or 500 feet or 1,000 feet where it will no longer be a problem  for you?  Six inches, Jimmy.  Oh, okay.  I was wrong.  Depends on the size of the aircraft and the attitude the aircraft is in.  If you look 20 years ago, there was all kinds of thunderstorms sitting around Dallas and  a Delta airplane.  This was before they had the thunderstorm alerts.  It got into that.  It had a really, really high nose-up attitude, and it made the perfect arc, and that crashed 
[01:56:00]  and broke the tail off.  It's like a lightning rod.  Exactly correct.  Yes.  All right.  Fascinating.  What do you feel in the air, though, when a plane gets hit by lightning?  Do you remember the old movies, like Airplane and that, when they were in and they were  rocking and rolling, and the lights would dim and, you know, go black and come back on  again from the ultromagnetic interference?  Yeah.  That's what used to happen.  Now they have solid state, and, you know, everything is state-of-the-art, so you don't  even feel it.  Up in the front of the cockpit, they would see it because they would see a slight blip on 
[01:56:30]  their instrumentation, but virtually you'd never even notice it now.  But is it possible to blow a hole in the wing or something, or no?  No, it just, you've got nothing to ground it to.  It'll just run through the airplane like shit through a goose.  Oh, wow.  Like shit through a goose, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Shit goes through a goose relatively well.  I hate when I get goose shit on my dick.  Oh, that's terrible.  I had higher hopes for that.  Joke.  I'm being careful not to step on you.  That was my fault. 
[01:57:00]  I know.  Everyone's on edge now.  Yeah.  Everyone's on edge.  All the callers are on edge.  Everyone's on edge.  Good.  Don't step on each other.  They are on notice.  All right, James.  Very good.  Thank you for that.  And yeah, I guess you explained the plane crash in Columbia as well.  Yeah.  And again, when you asked me a question before, like, you know, what's the best planes to  fly on?  I'm thinking Colombian airliners and I'm on the top 100.  No.  Yeah, probably as far as maintenance goes. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  And who knows what they're using for instrumentation.  Like, when you're flying major North American carriers, they're going to have the best on  board for instrumentation.  So they're not going to be acceptable to conditions like this.  So they took all their avionics out just to stash cocaine behind there.  Right.  Yeah.  I once had a Russian aircraft in a place.  I looked and it was broken.  I want to go and see the see the aircraft.  And it had like cathode ray tubes in it.  And the cockpit was like about six miles long. 
[01:58:00]  And on one of the gauges, it had a deckle of the Madonna over the gauge.  And I said, what does that do?  And he says, the gauge is broken.  We don't work it anymore.  We just pray to it.  That's funny.  An old Aeroflot plane.  That's exactly what it was.  Aeroflot.  Wow.  All right, boys.  Have a good day.  Bye, mister.  Good call, James.  Thank you.  Let's go to Crotch Critter.  Crotch Critter.  Oh, V?  Hey.  Good evening. 
[01:58:30]  Hello.  Hello.  ACC.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey, two things.  First of all, down in the Gulf, we have jumbo shrimp that you get about 10 to a pound.  Okay.  We have some of the largest ones, other than the prawns that you get from like New Zealand.  The prawn.  The other thing is, yeah.  The other thing, I hope I hate to shit on you, but salmon doesn't come from the Gulf.  It comes from the West Coast or from a...  Well, that's why I took your phone call to make you look stupid.  I was showing my paranoia by saying I'm even paranoid of salmon, knowing that it doesn't 
[01:59:00]  come from down there, sir.  From the Gulf.  That was about being very, very paranoid in seafood in general right now.  There, Crotch Critter.  Oh, he left.  Oh, wow.  We can still discuss this.  Left an embarrassment.  Because I wanted to ask, why'd you hang up?  We could get past this.  What are the big...  We could get past this.  We could get past this.  Because my point was to show paranoia, not the stupidity.  I mean, I show stupidity in other ways.  I know that.  But I wanted to ask Crotch Critter about if he's worried about the fucking shrimp in the 
[01:59:30]  Gulf.  What are the big...  That's what you do for a living.  The big Gulf seafood.  I know the jumbo shrimp.  We know shrimp.  Gulf shrimp is Gulf shrimp.  What about probably a lot of shellfish.  Crabs.  There.  Yeah.  Got some crab in probably.  Crabs.  Some crabs.  Muscles.  And I would imagine a lot of ugly fish.  Scouts.  Ugly fish.  Like the dog face fish.  All those.  Nurse shark.  No.  Nurse sharks are in the Gulf. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Did I see a video yesterday that will drive you fucking nuts when you just mentioned shark.  Actually, I saw two shark videos yesterday.  One on Vimeo, which was amazing.  I think it was in the news.  A surfer took his camera.  He was surfing and saw sharks, right?  So he goes out there the next day in some kind of, like, paddle boat.  It didn't really show the little fucking vessel he was on.  And then he filmed the sharks just circling underneath his paddle boat to prove that, yeah, I was surfing here with sharks yesterday. 
[02:00:30]  What an asshole.  They're just hanging out in this area.  First of all, that is amazing.  What a dope.  That was on my Twitter yesterday if you want to find it.  And then a guy sent me a video.  It was a 10-minute video of his buddy bringing in a hammerhead shark.  On Rod and Reel?  Oh, yeah.  Right off the beach.  Guy caught it right off the beach and dragging this monster out of the water.  And I'm thinking to myself the whole time, Jimmy would lose his mind.  I would just like to see the guy killed by it.  I've got to find the video now for you.  Huh?  I'd love to see him killed by it. 
[02:01:00]  It's like, what are you doing?  Well, he's not going to get killed by it if he's on the sand and, you know.  Hey, look at me like this!  What?  Well, they were pretty impressed.  Of course they were.  They were grabbing it by the tail, yanking it out of the water.  Yeah, of course they were.  I've got to find this video for Jimmy.  It goes right to you.  Jimmy's quite the animal lover.  It's just unnecessary.  Oh, I understand.  I'm not knocking it at all.  I mean, I agree with you a lot of the times, except with chickens. 
[02:01:30]  I think chickens destroy them.  Keep the chicken holocaust going.  I'm starving.  Dude, I know.  I eat them, too.  I'm not saying I don't.  Yeah, and there's no real economical way to make it better for the chicken to feed so many people.  I got the one.  I don't have the other one.  Danny, go to my Twitter.  The third down is the video of the guy on his little paddle boat or whatever filming the fucking sharks. 
[02:02:00]  Like, three down.  See, that's nice.  The guy just films them.  Look at these guys.  Hey, look.  They're in their natural habitat.  The guy doesn't really talk much, though.  But, I mean, you'll get the idea.  Me, my shark, and I.  So, here he is out.  Oh, man.  This is where he was surfing the day before.  And now, you see, he's trying to put his camera in the water to get a good shot.  He's got, like, a little underwater camera thingy.  Right.  It's done all in fisheye lens kind of a thing.  He's in a little kayak. 
[02:02:30]  Well, it's one of these sports videos.  I actually got the sports video camera.  It's pretty cool.  Looks like he's in the kayak.  He could do some cool shit with him.  Oh, wait, wait.  Is that one coming at him?  Yeah.  So, now the camera is underneath the water.  He's in just a tiny little, like, paddle boat.  This is so creepy.  And there's a great white.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Is it a great white?  Someone's saying it's, like, a baby great white.  How can you really tell?  Because there's nothing to compare it to in this shot.  You measure from the tail to the fin.  So, there he's showing a great white under the water right under him. 
[02:03:00]  Why is he there?  Oh, get on the beach.  And this is where these guys were surfing the day before.  And he's paddling around.  Oh, so he's in, like, a little kayak.  That's it.  He's in the kayak.  Why?  Just a kayak with his little underwater video camera.  I wouldn't want to be there unless I was in a destroyer.  Look at that.  Oh, fuck you.  Right under him.  Look at the size of that.  That's a big fucking gray white.  That's a big fat.  That's a big fat, yo.  How could you say that's a baby gray white?  People are silly.  And then, uh...  And it just keeps coming around him. 
[02:03:30]  It's just circling around.  Look at that fucking...  And it doesn't look too deep out there, right?  No.  It looks like you can see the sand.  That sound's making me have to pee-pee.  I know.  Me, too.  I got a wee-wee.  Oh, boy.  Is he a long swim from shore, too?  Look at that.  Right under the fucking kayak he's in.  And then the fin hit the kayak.  Yeah, and it scared him.  And then it took off.  Yeah.  Oh, the shark took off?  Yeah.  That's a video the guy made.  What a fag the shark is.  Sharks get scared.  Video's doing really well on Vimeo, which is a pretty cool site. 
[02:04:00]  Vimeo?  Yeah, Vimeo's all right.  They put the wrong letter in.  It's supposed to be video, but they put an M.  Vimeo.  It's like Vimeo.  I wish I could find the Hammerhead Shark video for Jimmy, maybe after the break.  Some real man's man reeling it in.  A man's man's guide to shark's shark.  Having a brew.  Hey, what do you want?  Let's go celebrate our big victory.  Clink, clink, clink.  Did you see the cove, Jimmy?  I did.  I hear it's deeply depressing. 
[02:04:30]  It's just enraging.  I haven't seen it yet.  I want to, but.  I want it to, but I'm like, I don't want to be so depressed.  What's this, brother?  Oh, it's just.  I heard it's depressing.  It's an ad before a video starts.  It makes you not want to go to fucking SeaWorld or any of that stuff.  Just somebody catching a Hammerhead Shark.  Oh, it might be the same one.  I don't know.  There's a bunch of them, so.  Off the beach?  I'm not sure.  Oh, the BlackBerry keyboard.  Oh, that's the torch.  Wow.  Oh, you gotta love it.  We talked about that earlier.  50% off.  Not good.  Doing well.  Not good.  50% off already. 
[02:05:00]  A week after it was released.  Because you want keys on your fucking phone.  Yeah.  No, this is a different one.  That's just something.  I want to show Jimmy the one where he's catching it off the beach, because there's no real challenge  there.  I respect.  There's no chance that he's going to fall in the water and have to battle it out.  He's just pulling him onto the beach?  Yeah.  Is this at Ryan catching a Hammerhead?  No, that's different, too.  He's on the beach.  This is fine.  I'm sure it's the same type of video, but.  You might say that shark would have just tipped that kayak upside down.  He could have done that in a second. 
[02:05:30]  He could have grabbed the front of it with his teeth and flipped it, and that guy would  have been upside down staring at a shark.  Oh, and just starts eating his head.  Yeah.  You talk to the surfers, though.  A lot of them are just not scared of the sharks, man.  They understand the sharks better than you and I.  Look at them videotaping it with their phone.  It's a little baby shark.  It's a small one.  This was a big, huge hammerhead.  Look at him with a hook and a little baby shark.  What a douchebag.  I would love to see him bite his foot, though.  Yeah, I would love that, too.  So.  It's just terrible. 
[02:06:00]  Crotch is back.  What?  CC.  I'm back for my beating.  Go ahead.  No, no.  I was just trying to explain why I said salmon, but that's fine.  We're past that.  I mean, you depend on shrimp for your livelihood down there?  Well, I mean, a lot of people do.  I'm a truck driver, so, I mean, we sit there and, you know, we haul that shit all over the place.  Right.  You think the shrimp are safe down there now?  Okay.  Oh, look.  I eat in truck stops.  I eat nasty-ass shitty food in truck stops. 
[02:06:30]  I don't think a bunch of oily-ass shrimp's going to kill me.  All right.  Good point.  Now, that's funny.  See?  You called back with a great fucking line.  All right.  We must have got off on the wrong foot.  No, no.  Not at all, bro.  Half this shit doesn't mean anything in the end.  All right, Crotch.  Thank you.  Here's the hammerhead video, Jimmy.  That is a big one.  Yeah.  Would this drive you nuts?  This guy reeling it in on the beach?  Just dragging this thing in by its face.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Let it be.  Let's just take our time. 
[02:07:00]  Let's just take our time, man.  I'd love to see somebody just hit this guy with a bat and cut the fucking string.  It is a huge hammerhead.  Looks full-grown to me, but I don't know much about fucking hammerhead.  Look at him go, guys.  Look at him go.  Yeah, he's trying to get back to where he can breathe, dummy.  You want me to grab him?  Okay, I'm going to grab his tail, man.  Yeah, grab his tail.  Oh, I wish he would turn around and just bite his arm off.  There's nothing that would make me happier than a hand being bitten off.  Well, this is sport for a lot of people, Jimmy.  Of course it is.  It's a sport. 
[02:07:30]  It is.  Sure.  Sportsman.  Hold up here, guys.  Hold up here.  Hold up here.  It's huge.  This thing is a huge hammerhead shark.  How about you go there and just punch it with your fist and catch it?  Well, he's at least trying to catch it with his bare hands to help his buddy.  Oh, big deal.  It's on the fucking beach.  I think they're on a highway.  And now it's like getting kind of caught in the waves.  Now it can't really fucking swim anymore.  Yeah, now it's kind of beached.  It's sort of beached.  Yeah, they're just humiliating it.  And now he's going to yank it out by the tail.  They got ropes around it now, Jimmy. 
[02:08:00]  It's just flopping around trying to get back in the water.  Now you caught this thing.  What are you going to do with it?  I think they lassoed it.  That is a monster.  Wow.  Yeah, they got a rope around its tail.  And now they're going to pull the big, huge hammerhead.  Oh, and its hammerhead eyeball is in the sand.  It can't breathe.  It's just sitting there.  What fucking cunts?  Now it's on its back.  There you go. 
[02:08:30]  Look at how long it took that fish to get that big.  Oh, I fucking hate these people.  Get down these measurements.  Right down.  Get his measurements.  That's all this is.  Why don't you measure your cock and show each other, you fucking faggots?  How long?  How long?  How long?  About six.  How long are you?  How long?  Four and a half.  Do they let it go?  Eleven feet.  I didn't get to the end of it because they're in a hurry to do things.  They might let it go.  Okay.  If they do, then I will be very happy, and I was wrong.  Overall length is 11 foot two. 
[02:09:00]  Eleven foot two.  Eleven foot two.  Looks like they're going to let it go.  Oh, okay.  I didn't get to the end of it because it bothers me as well, Jimmy.  Hey, what are you doing?  You want to get your leg cut off?  It's not my thing.  You want to get the rat butter?  Although my brother invited me to go fishing this weekend.  Here, here.  Do they have any idea how to put it back in the fucking water now that it's beached?  Well, they're taking the rope off the tail.  It looks like they're going to let it go.  Yeah, it looks like they're trying to get it back in the water.  Oh, the guy got hit by the tail.  It's like the shark just behaved.  They're trying to get rid of you, stupid. 
[02:09:30]  Now you're mad at the shark.  Well, he's not.  No, Jimmy's mad at the shark.  They're trying to help you, dummy.  Well, you don't blame him for being confused.  He just got yanked out of his environment.  He doesn't know what a ruler is.  Why would you assume they're going to now put you back in your comfy hold?  They're putting him back in.  All right.  Well, then I was wrong.  Good.  I'm glad I was wrong.  Yeah, but he's kind of swimming off with a little wobble.  Yeah, he looks a little high.  And I've heard that most of these catch-and-release fish end up dying.  Really?  Are you doing what you did yesterday with the news? 
[02:10:00]  Somebody was telling me offline, they said most of the catch-and-release fish end up dying  because of the shock, I guess, and the damage that was done being real dead.  Is the hook out of its mouth?  Probably not.  They probably just snipped it.  I didn't see him try to get the hook out of its mouth or wherever they hooked him.  He's stuck in the sand, eh?  He's stuck in the sand.  We got to pull him back.  We got to pull him back.  What?  He's stuck in the sand.  Because he doesn't understand the beach.  You got him?  Here we go.  Oh, there's not much fight left in the hammerhead. 
[02:10:30]  No, that thing should be turning around and just biting this guy's stomach out.  Yeah.  Well, I don't hate these people as much because they were just measuring it.  Yeah.  Hopefully it's okay.  Oh, wait.  Is he swimming away?  Yeah.  I'm sure he will.  Oh, by the way, the guy wasn't in a kayak.  He was in a paddle surfer.  That's just kind of like a surfboard that you kind of hang out on with a paddle.  That's a little crazy.  And he went out there to check out the sharks.  Oh, there he goes.  You going good?  All right.  He's not going that good.  You just see him float belly up.  Yeah, he's fine. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  He's coming back.  He's coming back.  Yeah.  There he is right there, guys.  Nice 11-foot-2 hammerhead.  Well, not so nice anymore.  Will.  Will.  You know, the hammerhead.  That's how it's done, buddy.  We got on the camera, right?  Hammerhead's just wondering, what was that about?  Why?  Couldn't he just make up a measurement and lie?  Estimate.  These fishermen are jerks. 
[02:11:30]  Very funny, Kevin.  You jerk.  Let me go to Jeremy in Canada.  Jeremy in Canada.  Oh, fuck that.  I'm all paranoid.  No, go ahead, Jeremy.  Go ahead.  Make it good.  How did you get through this?  I'm telling you.  Right on.  Where I'm from, guys, there's a lot of that going through July through September.  It's called Sharks Unlimited.  It's got its own website.  Okay.  And it's a lot of, like, chest bump and chest pound and stuff.  And they catch mako, port beagles.  There's quite a few whites in the area.  And it's just, it's not that they take the hook so deep into their guts and die. 
[02:12:00]  They bleed out.  A lot of them are mouth hooked, side of the mouth.  But a lot of them, most of them will be released unharmed.  Yeah, unharmed.  But a lot of them, it's all exhaustion and stuff.  So it's really hard for them to recover.  Yeah.  So a lot of these fish do end up dying.  I mean, you feel like you're doing the right thing and you see the thing swim away.  But now it's dealing with the fucking...  Well, can't they sleep?  Yeah.  Damage that it just took on.  How tired is it?  It swims all day.  Struggle for 10 minutes? 
[02:12:30]  You know what?  I've turned the corner.  Massacre sharks.  Faggots.  All right, Jerry.  And Keith in Connecticut.  Keith, go ahead.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Jimmy, I'm a big fan.  I've been to see you three times, Jimmy.  Here comes the butt.  For a minute.  Thank you, man.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  My problem is is that, like, you're calling the fishermen asshole and everything else.  You know what kind of accomplishment it is to catch a shark from the beach?  I mean, anybody that goes fishing knows how hard that is.  Yeah, you need a long string.  Yeah.  A pole. 
[02:13:00]  You eat sushi more than anybody on the show.  They got to catch those fucking fish and kill them for you to eat them.  Dude, I'm not.  That's okay.  What I'm saying is this.  I don't claim to not eat meat.  I'm not coming from a whole.  It's just when it's done just for no reason.  When I see guys just fishing to be dicks, it drives me crazy.  I don't think I'm macho by eating meat.  Like, I'm not being proud holding up a fish, going, hey, hey, hey, and then just being  a cunt about it.  I'd do that.  Understand.  We go fishing.  We throw them back all the time, but sometimes the hooks do get caught in the air, and we 
[02:13:30]  cut the line.  But I don't know.  They always say that the hook falls out.  I don't know how to fuck that hook.  No, it doesn't.  Why don't you do that to a dog?  Like, literally, go in the neighborhood, hang a hot dog on a giant fucking hook, and drag  a beagle by the face into your yard, and watch how mad people get at you.  That sounds fun.  And then take the hook out and release the beagle back to the neighborhood.  No, no, no.  Cut the hook.  And leave the hook in his little mouth.  And watch him and his floppy ears run around in his own shit. 
[02:14:00]  How many guys would stop fishing after they had to do that?  Imagine they said, all right, if you want a fishing license, we got a little exercise  we want you guys to do first.  People have put animals in different categories, and mammals are put in a different category  than our fish.  Not by the Japanese, they're not.  Well, no.  The Japanese are crazy with their...  But no, actually, wait a minute.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they go whaling.  People don't really look at whales like mammals.  Dude, Japanese are not going to be happy until every living thing either has shit on its 
[02:14:30]  face or is dead.  I was going to say every living thing ends up in a pussy.  Yeah, that's what they're about.  See you guys later.  All right.  They like shoving heels in assholes and stuff.  I want to tamp some whale blubber down in your pussy.  Is that okay?  But do they use it like where they could use other stuff?  Like, why are you using whale blubber?  Makes it make a good hat.  It make a good hat rim.  Whale blubber makes awful hats.  No, it doesn't.  It's heavy and wobbly.  It's like wearing a lard hat. 
[02:15:00]  It looks silly and it stinks after a while.  You have to refrigerate your hat.  Yeah, they really are just terrible.  I was watching that Whale Wars show and I always hated Greenpeace and their fucking hippie  attitude and shit like that.  But these guys are just going after these whaling vessels, these Japanese whaling vessels.  And it's pretty fucking cool.  It annoys me how political Greenpeace got, but they are really fucking ballsy to save 
[02:15:30]  these animals the way they do.  There's things that they do that I don't like.  I call it stupid.  But they are ballsy people, man.  Right on.  All right.  I mean, everyone wants to talk about fishing, but we got to take a break because Sarah,  the blogger, took our invitation.  Good.  She's calling the show today.  Oh, that's nice.  From yesterday, remember?  Yes.  She blogged about my review on Red Eye of Eat, Pray, Love.  And my issue with her is not that she didn't think it's funny. 
[02:16:00]  Let me say that right from the get-go.  I have no issue with somebody not thinking something's funny.  That's...  Whatever, right.  Yeah.  Come on.  It's comedy subjective.  You got to understand that the guy is going for some laughs and not serious.  Yeah.  And she seemed to not get that point.  Can we replay the review out of break so it's fresh in everyone's mind?  Yeah.  And then we'll go right to her?  All right.  Okay.  So you'll hear Jimmy's review once again from Red Eye.  It's worth playing again because it was really, really funny.  And right after that, we'll have Sarah on who just tried to, you know, kill you. 
[02:16:30]  She wasn't happy.  Yeah.  She wasn't happy with you being funny for some reason.  She was displeased.  So we'll get to the bottom of that in a few minutes.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show, 866-1212.  That's 866-969-1969.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  Wow.  And I'm not even on that.  That was nice, huh?  It's sensuous, succulent, and life-affirming.  And it opens this Friday. 
[02:17:00]  I speak of that movie, Eat, Pray, Love.  It's a liberating tale of a woman's year-long trip to three far-flung countries of the world.  The character, played by Julia Roberts, finds herself embarking on a search for pleasure.  Spiritual enlightenment as a way to find balance.  In her life.  It's not just a travelogue, really.  It's an empowering story of self-fulfillment.  With me now is Jim Norton, our Eat, Pray, Love correspondent.  Jim, by the way, thank you for becoming our Eat, Pray, Love correspondent.  Thank you for asking me, Greg.  Well, you know what?  You were the first person I thought of.  I should have been.  Yeah, you've been preparing for weeks for this movie, haven't you? 
[02:17:30]  I really have been.  I've been meditating on the toilet and punching my own testicles.  Yeah, really?  Interesting.  Now, then the movie begins.  She's a wreck.  The Julia Roberts character's wreck.  She's bankrupt.  Her wedding's over.  And she just says, you know what?  I'm going to get up and I'm going to leave.  What kind of message does this send to American women?  It's important, Greg, because it says that no matter how lousy a wife you are or how bad  an employee or how horrible you are with money, there's always time for a vacation.  Yes, exactly.  Exactly.  Just get up. 
[02:18:00]  Go to Karachi.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, you know, she goes to Italy.  And you know what she does?  She enjoys the, she savors the simple Italian foods on her first day.  She eats a lot of gelato.  She really does.  And then there's that wonderful scene at the end where she's vomiting gelato and Jägermeister  into a gutter.  Yeah, it's interesting, you know.  A lot of movies wouldn't show that.  No, but they do.  And then Eric Roberts comes over and overacts again.  It's really a nice moment between both of them.  It's unusual because they're related, yet they share a love scene.  Yes.  Which makes no sense.  Yeah, and yet he stayed here and she went way up there. 
[02:18:30]  Really comforting for both of them.  Now, she takes a language course.  She does.  Yes.  Through a series of wacky mishaps.  She has to say, it's an emergency.  Where's the toilet?  With 40 different languages.  Really?  Why, that's so beautiful, though.  It really is.  She does find the toilet.  Oh, thank God.  Half the time she does.  Half the time she has to improvise, right?  Hats, fields, whatever she can.  Steins.  Oh, that Julia.  She's charming no matter what she does.  I know.  A hole in the ice in Alaska.  Incredible.  Oh, God.  No, she discovers yoga. 
[02:19:00]  She goes to meditate and she approaches spirituality with skepticism and then she's won over, isn't  she?  She does.  I was the first one to start clapping what she really did because I didn't know if she  was going to overcome.  Yeah, you had no idea, did you?  Oh, it was heartbreaking.  These yoga scenes and I'm sipping my chamomile tea and I'm lactating and I'm thinking about  my vagina and motherhood and then she finally realized what she was supposed to realize.  I don't want to blow it for everybody, but really, it was important.  What happens at the end of the movie?  I mean, I don't want to spoil it for everybody, but does she finally find her true love? 
[02:19:30]  She really does.  She goes to India and she begins traipsing barefoot through the slums and falls in love  with the smell of garbage and a man with one foot.  Oh.  See, it doesn't matter if you are missing a foot.  Is that the message?  That is the message because she holds up his good one and she goes, this is going to go  too and then she kisses it and the film ends.  She's marvelous.  Did you smell Oscar?  Oh, Greg, this is the finest film I've ever been forced to sit through at gunpoint.  It really was wonderful.  All right.  Well, you know what? 
[02:20:00]  We're going to close things out with a post-game rapper from TV's Andy Levy.  And that's Jim Norton with a very funny review of Eat, Pray, Love.  Thank you.  And it led to Sarah writing a whole blog about it.  Why is Eat, Pray, Love a joke?  It's Sarah Arboleda.  I'm going to guess this is how you say the last name.  Arboleda.  Yeah, we got her on the hotline right here.  Sarah, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, thank you for having me.  Hi.  Now, Jimmy was very confused by your blog.  We got Jim Norton across the way from me here. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, it didn't.  Let me start, Sarah, by saying it wasn't about you thinking it was funny or not funny.  I mean, that's a completely subjective opinion.  So if something didn't strike you as funny, that's, you know, it is what it is.  But my question is, why the reaction?  Like, what didn't you do not understand that I had not seen this film and it was a ludicrous review?  Oh, no, it was the premise that you had not seen the film.  I mean, I haven't seen it either.  And, you know, to be fair, I did find it funny. 
[02:21:00]  It was funny.  But, no, it was going off of the concept that having not seen the film, having only seen the trailers and the awful advertising for it,  that it was coming across as, you know, just another one of those silly movies where women find themselves.  And that was the part I was having the problem with.  Well, I'll be honest.  I mean, that's really not what the intent was.  It was just to be ludicrous.  But self-discovery, I am bored with it.  And it does focus more on women.  But that's even the self-help section of a bookstore. 
[02:21:30]  You know, there's very little.  You know, you may have Male Sexuality by Bernie Zigerfeld and a few other books.  But it's all about women's self-discovery.  And that whole journey thing kind of bores me at this point.  And I agree, but I think that there's a special category where you look at a woman's self-discovery as being somehow less serious or boring or less important.  Because I would argue, and this isn't spoiling the film for anyone, but what is Inception if not a movie about two people finding themselves 
[02:22:00]  and, you know, discovering their bad relationships with their fathers or their kids or their wives or whatever.  And I kind of feel, I mean, I feel the same way that you do about women's films.  If I have to see another movie with a 40-year-old man in a shitty marriage with a shitty wife and shitty kids who's miserable and tired and, you know, he has a bad job or whatever, I'm going to shoot myself.  But you misunderstood where the point I was coming from.  It's almost like because you were looking at, I guess, from a point of view of feminism, you made my agenda what was actually your agenda. 
[02:22:30]  Because you say, like, first there's Norton's, like, why would my comments infuriate you if you knew it was coming from a silly place, a place of ludicrousness, where I had not seen the film?  And at one point in your review, you say, but Norton's criticism seems to have almost nothing to do with the film itself.  Well, that doesn't say to me that you really knew that I was just being absurd. 
[02:23:00]  No, I mean, I recognize the absurdity of the review.  Obviously, the whole thing with the one-legged guy has reached a level of farce that has nothing to do with the movie.  My concern was more from that place of it is funny, but it's still making fun of that concept of a woman's journey of self-discovery.  And I know you're saying it doesn't have anything specifically to do with women.  But that concept of, like, you know, I was thinking about my vagina and I was thinking about motherhood and I was lactating and so forth, 
[02:23:30]  it suggests that it is in some ways partly about the silliness of a woman's self-discovery.  No, it was about the silliness of this film.  It's like, don't you understand that when you start reading into things that are being made fun of and looking for the greater cause or the greater motive,  I mean, you can find any motive in me that you want to if you look hard enough.  And the reality is, I'm telling you because I'm the guy that said it, I really didn't know what the movie was about.  I was kind of going off of Greg's questions. 
[02:24:00]  Like when he said to me, there's one point where you say perhaps the most appalling of all this is Norton's assertion that Robert's character is just a bad, irresponsible person trying to escape from her failures as a woman.  Because I said it's important, Greg, because it says no matter how bad of a wife you are, no matter how horrible of an employee or how bad you are with money.  That was just going off of Greg's question because he said this person was divorced and this person was out of work.  And this person, so the thing for me was just to be funny and say go on a vacation. 
[02:24:30]  It had nothing to do with her failing as a woman.  It didn't even occur to me.  And I see the fairness in that, but then it still doesn't explain the comments about the lactation and the vagina.  I'll tell you the comment.  In all honesty, they were the same as the comments about the man with one foot.  To me, that was a funny thing to say.  To me, it was a joke to think that I was there clapping wildly and lactating because I don't have, well, female breasts. 
[02:25:00]  I kind of have man ones.  That conjure up a funny image.  It's a funny image, just like, so is kissing.  It's like you're accepting the absurdity of kissing a foot in a slum in India and saying, okay, this one's going to go next.  But you're not just accepting that it's absurd, that I was lactating and contemplating being a mother.  Are you saying then that you don't feel that there were any sexist undertones to what you were saying?  No.  First of all, sexism is just like, what does that even mean in humor? 
[02:25:30]  I mean, why not just say that I was classist because I was making fun of poor people in India?  And then you take me for task on saying go to Karachi, which was just an odd place for anyone to want to go on vacation because that's where Daniel Pearl was beheaded.  It's like you're reading into sex and gender issues when I have also attacked cop buddy movies and made fun of every type of movie. 
[02:26:00]  It's like you're going into my motives, which you were incorrect about.  And I accept that.  I think that my underlying problem is that have you seen the box office results for it?  It was probably very good.  I think the Expendables beat it.  But I think that Julia Roberts is a huge box office draw.  What did she do, like, I want to say $30 million, something like that?  I think it did, like, $22 million.  $22 million, $22 million, $22 million, $22 million. 
[02:26:30]  I do think that, in part, although your comments were ridiculous, and I accept that, and I did find them funny. 
[02:27:00]  I'm not saying that I sat there, you know, raging with feminism with Rosie the Riveter behind me.  But I will say that I think it does betray a certain underlying thing of women are less serious or they're boring as main protagonists.  No.  That's honestly, it doesn't betray that at all.  And if you thought it was funny, that's cool.  But there's nowhere in this review where you say, like, oh, look, I thought it was funny, but this. 
[02:27:30]  This seems like it's coming from a place of just this really upset and offended me.  And there's one part where you say about, instead, this seems like a platform for Norton to gripe about the dullness and unimportance of independent female protagonists.  I wasn't even thinking of that.  Like, I mean, it wasn't like I was attacking all women who are the leads in films.  Julia Roberts is a very good actress.  I think Meryl Streep's a great actress.  There's plenty of great actresses.  Kathy Bates, great actress.  I mean, you know, I can go down the list of people who I think are very talented. 
[02:28:00]  Nothing to do with that.  But it was just, to me, another drippy movie.  I don't want to see it.  And I don't want to see one about a guy touching his sensitive side.  And when you thought I was, like, loving the guns and stuff, my favorite movies are Cuckoo's Nest, you know, Clockwork Orange, The Godfather.  There's no tits in any of those movies.  Except maybe Clockwork Orange or one big, nice pair of tits.  And The Godfather.  Well, please, Apollonia for a half a second.  He doesn't even get to touch him.  And then she blows up in the car. 
[02:28:30]  That's not exactly a sexy scene, other than to maybe suicide bombers, which would tie in with a little Karachi reference.  But you see, it's attitudes like this that keep more films with female leads from being made.  That's not true.  What keeps any type of film from being made is box office.  That's what keeps films from being made.  And I'm not saying that that's right.  But that's what keeps fucking ugly people from getting the leads in romantic movies, too.  It's the box office.  Oh, absolutely.  And that was the comment that I was making, that because men do not want to go see these movies, you have fewer people going to see them. 
[02:29:00]  Women have to see them alone or see them with their friends.  And as a result, the box office draw is smaller.  And part of what my blog had been about was that I'm uncomfortable with the fact that that is often my mentality as well, that I have no desire to go see this movie.  I have no desire to go read this book.  My favorite movie is Stand By Me or Reservoir Dogs, all of these male-centric films, because they're well-made. 
[02:29:30]  And I enjoy them, and oftentimes the films with women are sappy or drippy, and it bothers me that I feel this way.  If I see one more movie with four or five women drinking wine, listening to old music, and dancing in their living room, I will throw up.  That, to me, if I see that in a trailer, I actually get angry that someone has done that again. 
[02:30:00]  And I don't think it has anything to do with being misogynistic.  It has to do with me not wanting to see a lousy movie.  It's not a sexist undertone or anything like that.  It just looks like a movie.  And I actually say it aloud to people in the room.  I go, I will never see that movie.  And it really doesn't have anything to do with some grand scheme of misogynistic thinking.  It just looks awful.  Well, I agree.  I mean, that is my opinion as well, that I had to sit through the holiday a couple years back with Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet. 
[02:30:30]  Sorry.  I wanted to shoot myself.  It was awful.  Yeah.  But, Sarah, if you're bothered by the same things, obviously, that Angie said, why wouldn't you like where this review came from then?  If I'm shitting on a genre that has kind of pegged women as just being this, like the fact that I'm mocking that or mocking the film, why wouldn't you go, whether or not you think it's funny, why wouldn't you go, oh, that's cool.  He's mocking what has become the only thing that's acceptable for women to be the lead in. 
[02:31:00]  Well, because I don't think that that's true, first of all.  I mean, Kill Bill obviously did very well.  Great film.  Both of them.  Yeah, and I love them.  And, I mean, but I don't love them because they star women.  However, what I was going to say was I felt that, and clearly I was mistaken, and I do apologize for putting your words out of context.  But I felt that the comment about the vagina or the lactation, that it, again, and, you know, I'm repeating myself here, but that it was suggesting in general, especially because you had not seen the movie, that it was just going to be another one of those silly films. 
[02:31:30]  But I was, not to interrupt you, but I was to a certain point saying that, but it wasn't coming from a place of, just like you didn't like Kill Bill just because it stars women, I didn't want to make fun of this movie just because it was about a woman. 
[02:32:00]  Of course it is about a woman.  I'm not saying I'm not going to bring that into it.  I'd be dishonest not to.  But that was not, this to me was no more make funable than, say, what was the movie about wine, Ope, that you saw with the guys?  Oh, God.  Sideways?  Yeah, like that movie.  Like, if they would have asked me to review that and I knew what it was about, I would have mocked it.  I had no desire to see that movie.  Actually, that was a great movie.  Yeah, I've heard it was good, but I mean, my desire to see that wasn't there.  And you misquoted me on one thing.  You said there's a wonderful scene where she vomits gelato and Jägermeister into a butter. 
[02:32:30]  I said into a gutter because into a butter would be a horrible joke.  Oh, I actually, I stole the quotes from Film Drunk.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Right.  I still.  I link the video.  I'm still confused.  I think you didn't realize that Jimmy was just mocking and joking and having fun with the review of the film.  No, I mean, at the risk of repeating myself again and sounding sort of tedious.  If you repeat yourself again, we hang up on you.  Yes, sir. 
[02:33:00]  I think I understood completely the tenor of the review, what was being said, the fact that Mr. Norton clearly had not seen it.  But I still come back to the word choice that was used.  And again, I understand that, oh, okay, it was a ridiculous thing because clearly he doesn't have a vagina and he doesn't lactate and he doesn't drink chamomile tea or do yoga.  Right.  And these are absurd images, but that, I don't know, that I still felt like it was an image of women that women themselves don't want to project and that I'm aware that it was supposed to be an attack on the film. 
[02:33:30]  I tapped out because, quite frankly, I was a little bored by you, but what do you want from films as far as women go?  What kind of movie would you like Hollywood to make for women?  I'm happy, I mean, I'm happy to see films like Kill Bill.  I had no desire to see Salt because it just looks stupid.  But I don't want necessarily women to be portrayed in a lovely way or a fantastic way at all times. 
[02:34:00]  I want to see more complex characters.  And I want to see something like Stand By Me for Women that isn't now and then, which was fucking awful.  I want to see movies about women that do not necessarily have to do all the goddamn time with them being women.  Oh, like those, like The Traveling Pants.  What was the name of that one?  Yeah, the Sisters of the Yahoo, Yaya, Sisterhood. 
[02:34:30]  So those type of movies drive you nuts, right?  Right, because it's always about your discovery of, you know, tampons or whatever.  Yeah, it is.  And you know what?  Your issue is with Hollywood, and I don't disagree with it.  But what happens is with feminism or any type of quote-unquote special interest, where they go wrong, I think, is they begin to take themselves too seriously.  And to look for, again, that greater good in every single thing, like PETA members who cannot make fun of animal suffering or Black Panther members that cannot make fun of – or Republicans that cannot make fun of religion or whatever the cause is. 
[02:35:00]  It's like, why can't somebody who's a very strong feminist, who believes very much in blue is not for boys, pink is not for girls, think a misogynistic joke is funny?  A misogynistic boss grabbing your ass is not funny because that's a lifestyle thing.  But to think that humor makes life a certain way is completely inaccurate. 
[02:35:30]  Comedy is, to me, taking what we see in life and mocking it.  It's not life imitating art.  It's really not that.  But then you are – I mean, I will say this.  Like, I love Louis C.K., and he is incredibly misogynistic in his humor.  That's great.  And what you just said about how it is often art imitating life, well, then it is – your comments were still a reflection on how most people see these movies or how most people see this kind of movie. 
[02:36:00]  Well, you know what?  You're very similar to us.  I'm starting to think that you might have just been on the rag that day when you wrote that blog.  Jesus.  Because – I'm serious, though, because you're in our wheelhouse.  I mean, you're like Louis and stuff, so you're not this over-the-top feminist.  No, and the site isn't supposed to be about that either.  I'm confused by you there.  Huh?  The site isn't supposed to be about that either.  I came across that a little bit in this particular blog.  Only in this one because you said that Norton's comments infuriated me. 
[02:36:30]  And it's like, if for no other reason than because he seems to suggest that a woman's spiritual journey of self-discovery  is frivolous, irresponsible.  The thing is, though, I was kind of saying the same thing about this movie that you seem to be thinking,  ugh, another one of these.  You didn't want to read it.  You didn't want to see it.  But because there was a guy making fun of it and being ludicrous and even having a misogynistic tone in some of the – of course I would have a misogynistic tone in certain jokes.  But that doesn't mean that I'm a misogynist or I wouldn't make fun of men with the same harshness. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, no.  And that was the one thing that I regret that did not come across in that, that I was not calling you a sexist,  but rather that I thought the comments were sexist.  And as you've already said, they're just reflecting societal attitudes.  So just that – I mean it is hard.  And a big part of the other part that I wish had come across a little bit stronger was that, yes, I feel this way too,  and it makes me uncomfortable as a woman. 
[02:37:30]  I had a feeling that you'd be cool to talk to for some reason.  It's like I wasn't mad at you.  I was like – again, somebody thinking I'm funny or not thinking I'm funny, I totally accept.  But my only suggestion is you write well.  I think – it's like I don't – whatever your opinions are are cool, but I just wish that feminists –  because I agree with a lot of what feminism stands for.  It just seems to me that as a movement, quote-unquote, or as a thought process or an ideology,  as things have gotten better, the arguments cannot be like say what they were in 1971. 
[02:38:00]  So the focus has shifted to a lot of harping on people's humor  or harping on what people say as jokes or portrayed as –  it's almost like it's become about unimportant things and scolding people  as opposed to changing what are real attitudes.  Yeah, I agree.  And I think that the big foci or focuses need to be on the real issues like the wage gap 
[02:38:30]  or what have you or advertising for women.  And I do a lot of – I mean, in my other articles, I do a lot of work calling bullshit feminists out.  So this was perhaps a misstep for me where I was kind of going down the wrong path with being the angry feminist  because that's never how you want to come across because you're always going to come across as a zealot  and someone who can't be reasoned with.  Well, let me give you a plug on the site because there's a lot of stuff on the site.  Before that, Jimmy, I think she owes you an apology. 
[02:39:00]  Sarah, I think it's only right.  Agreed. All right.  No, I want to hear a nice apology.  Please.  That's helping.  Oh, hi.  Am I making you uncomfortable?  Sarah, can you please apologize to Jim Norton?  He's a very sensitive boy.  Well, I do apologize.  It does seem like I took the comments out of context and that I clearly have not offended you  but made it seem as though you were something that you were not  and you were saying something that you were not. 
[02:39:30]  Thank you, Sarah.  That was very nice.  Let me plug this site.  If you were in the office, I'd give you a nice pinch on the hiney.  That's okay.  Give your fanny a pinch.  It's one word.  It's zeldalily.com.  Z-E-L-D-A-L-I-L-Y dot com.  And where are you?  I was reading.  Our producer gave us a little bit of a bio on you.  It said that you want to go to...  Are you in college now?  Do you want to come to the East Coast in the U.S.?  Yeah, I'm up in Vancouver, B.C. in Canada. 
[02:40:00]  Okay.  And I'm hoping to come out to the East Coast for grad school.  All right.  Well, she was very nice.  Yeah, Sarah was all right.  It was nice talking to you, Sarah.  All right.  Thank you for having me on.  Thanks.  All right.  Take care.  Good job.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  That was very uncomfortable.  That was really uncomfortable.  He apologized.  She was nice.  It was an apology.  It's weird, though, because if she likes Louis C.K., then I don't even know why she wrote  that article.  Because people have these weird gut reactions.  And it's like when I read something about myself, sometimes I get very angry. 
[02:40:30]  And this didn't make me angry because it was like, again, it wasn't about me being funny  or not funny, but it was like sometimes when you just talk to people a little bit, it's  not as bad as it...  It's always, you know, if we just talk things out as a society.  And the fact that she was...  How many things we could overcome.  Well, I think the problem is what's infuriating when people don't even get the basics down  of what they're writing about.  You know, it was obvious that you were just goofing.  And I don't think she realized that until she heard it again before she came on the  air and discussed it with you. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  She really thought you were serious.  I don't know what she looked like.  I don't know what she...  Can't find a pic of her, huh?  I don't know.  If Danny can't find a picture, it doesn't exist.  Yes, Dan?  Well, I think I have her Facebook, but it's like a group shot, so...  Oh, you don't know?  It could be like any one of them.  Yeah, I'm not her friend.  I'm not her friend, so I can't see her other pictures.  A lot of girls out there get group shots with their hot friends, and then you just assume  that they're one of the hot...  I'm just going to assume that she's probably not good, because I noticed that group shots  and animals are usually a big fat slob, so... 
[02:41:30]  When all the girls' pictures are animals...  When your profile picture is a cat, you're a fat, ugly bitch.  Goddamn.  That is so fucking true.  And look at all of my pictures, and there's 22 pictures, and there's like the beach, and  a cat, and fucking a car.  You're just like, uh-oh.  I just see it all the time.  Anytime there's a new friend request, and it's just like some dog head, or... 
[02:42:00]  Because it works the same for guys, too.  It's not just women.  It's nice!  Well, no, no.  I'll accept it, but then I'll look at the rest of their pictures and go, oh, of course.  You know?  Well, now it makes sense.  Of course you accept.  You want all the friends as possible.  Well, yeah, but you also got to make sure, and say, because now, because you have a bet  with yourself that this is going to be some ugly fat person, so now you need to just make  sure.  Put them in a special category, that's all.  All right, can we, uh...  I got to take a break, because I want to eat my eggs and ham here.  That smells good, too.  I want some ham.  They're not even green.  Relatively healthy.  I want to see what she looks like now. 
[02:42:30]  She was actually nice.  Yeah.  I liked her.  No, I liked her, man.  She held her up.  Wouldn't that be interesting if you two kind of, you know, got together?  Interesting for me.  Depressing for her.  She's probably this young, hot college student.  I'm in my 40s.  I have a girlfriend.  Yeah, that could be.  I wanted to hang up when I said, what kind of movies you want Hollywood to make for women,  but then I was like, you know, Jimmy's in the middle of this.  I can't do that.  Yeah, no, because she wasn't being...  That was my hang-up.  She didn't merit being crappy.  She was being nice.  All right.  Quick break.  Oh, that's her? 
[02:43:00]  Eyes closed.  Oh, boy.  What is that about?  That's a nice picture.  That means she's got a funny eye.  Which one is she in this picture, then?  She's got to be the frump.  Yeah, right.  The frump.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  The frump dress.  Hang on.  She's got to be.  Let's see.  She's not the fucking ginger.  All right.  Let's pop this up.  Yeah, see, look.  Because if I go back...  Hang on.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh.  All right.  Dark hair, fair skin.  Very fair skin.  So...  Sort of an oval-shaped face.  All right.  So then we go to the Facebook. 
[02:43:30]  That's got to be it.  Right there.  That's her.  With the frump dress.  See?  Oh, yeah.  That's her.  You put your mouse...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Look, look.  That doesn't work like that.  She's the frump with the big rump.  Let me see.  Open up the page.  I can't.  I'm not her friend.  You can't just make it better.  I'm not her friend.  I can do this if you want.  You can do that.  Yeah, she was nice.  I just want to see if she...  Yes, of course she was nice.  But as men, we just want to see what she looks like. 
[02:44:00]  For how shallow we are.  Well, no.  Men are visual.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, we're very visual.  And you hope they have the personality to back up their tits.  Let's see.  Right?  Is that her?  You think?  It's got to be.  She doesn't look like any of these other ones.  Wow.  Hard to say.  Who looks like they write for the feminism blog in this picture?  All right.  You make a good point.  Maybe it's just her sticking out from the... 
[02:44:30]  No.  It's hard to say.  I don't know.  It's probably old boy haircut.  What do you think, fellas?  Old boy haircut.  That dress is atrocious.  Yeah, I'd say the dress is not...  She probably has a nice little chubby hiney under there.  You like the big rump?  I do, yeah.  Underneath there.  You think that's it?  That might just not be a good shot of her.  Because that woman in that photo looks older than like a college age girl.  Yeah, yeah.  What the hell's going on there?  I don't know.  I want to get a Facebook request her.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  I want to be a friend.  I don't want to be a friend to a feminist. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  Let's go wee-wees and eat.  We'll be back.  The Colby and Anthony show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  I don't mind such a time.  The images it shows.  I can taste you on my lips and smell you in my clothes.  Cinnamon and sugary and softly spoken lies. 
[02:45:30]  You never know just how you look through other people's eyes.  Butthole.  Butthole surfers, right, Pepper?  That's a good song.  You know, I was listening to some...  Yeah, I think it was a faggy channel on Sirius XM.  It was a bit on the faggy side.  Out cue?  It wasn't out cue.  I don't go all fag.  That's full fag.  I don't go full fag.  Although I get along with the guys that do the morning show.  They seem like lovely gentlemen.  They seem sweet. 
[02:46:00]  I wonder if they've had Stephen Slater on.  They're all about the gay.  I wonder if they've had the JetBlue guy on.  I was listening to some channel, and they had a remake of that fucking song.  Really?  And it's one of those versions where you're like, how do I know this?  How do I fucking know this?  Because it's so different.  Yeah.  And then that part kicked in.  I'm like, that's a butthole surface remake.  Wow.  Can you find that real fast, Travis?  I know this is out of the blue.  Live version. 
[02:46:30]  Remember those days?  I don't even know what channel.  I listen to the Spectrum every once in a while.  I might have been on the Spectrum.  The Spectrum.  Nothing coming up?  Nah, fuck.  No worries.  Maybe if one of the guys down the hall...  No.  Just throw it on for a second.  I do know this.  We got to give Big Mama Prods a nice plug today.  Of course, that's...  Patrice O'Neal?  Yeah, that's his Twitter account.  He took a picture with Biz Markie yesterday.  Yeah.  And it's getting a lot of publicity. 
[02:47:00]  A lot of comments.  Yeah, a lot of comments.  There's a buzz on this picture.  Why?  What happened?  What's that?  I was looking for the cover of...  Yeah, Travis was fine.  What were you saying?  Big Mama Prods.  Okay.  Because we got to take a look at Patrice O'Neal.  He got a picture with Biz Markie at CVS, of all places.  He was laughing a lot at the comments that were coming.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He kind of looks like he could be Biz Markie's brother.  I don't know if that's racist or not, but they certainly look very similar. 
[02:47:30]  God, I met Biz Markie years ago up in Canada.  Fucking Biz Markie and Patrice O'Neal.  A motherfucking two-shot.  That's a pretty good shot right there.  They're dressed very alike.  I have a photo with Biz Markie as well.  He has his arm around me in the Detroit airport.  Patrice's photo is better.  But the comments supposedly are really, really funny.  Is there anything that we could look at real fast?  Who took the picture?  The security camera? 
[02:48:00]  There you go.  Oh, that comment, of course.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  They really are being nasty.  One, one.  Wow.  Well, how many times was this the last thing seen by a cashier before they were shot dead?  Jesus.  God, that's a good one.  That's a hoot.  Any others?  Jimmy.  CVS Pharmacist.  Like I just said, we don't sell anything to cleanse your system out.  I'm sorry, guys. 
[02:48:30]  I don't have anything to pass your drug test.  Now, please leave and take your lotion and Afro machine with you.  That's a racially biased one.  Getting Accu-Check strips?  Take care of your feet, son.  I got the sweet blood.  Oh, there you go.  You can check out.  Oh, we got the cover, too?  It's like a bluesy, like, rockish type song.  Was I doing a little blues action over the weekend?  I don't know.  Is it Keller Williams?  Yes, it is.  Were you listening to some blues?  Yeah.  I also want to thank Waylon from Georgia.  He came up with it. 
[02:49:00]  But this is the same fucking butthole surfer song.  Just a little taste.  Holy shit.  Exactly.  Who's doing this?  Keller Williams.  Marky got with Sharon.  Sharon got Cherie.  She was sharing Sharon's outlook on the topic of disease.  Mikey had a facial scar.  Tommy was a racist.  All in love with Diane.  They was doing it in Texas.  Tommy played piano like a kid out in the rain. 
[02:49:30]  Lost his leg.  And dad, I'll see you dancing to the train.  All in love with Diane.  They was drinking from a fountain.  That was pouring like an avalanche.  Avalanche coming down the mountain.  And that's when I finally got it.  Finally.  Oh, here's the hook.  As it shows, I can taste you on my lips and smell you in my clothes.  Cinnamon, sugary, and softly spoken lies.  You never know just how you look through other people's eyes. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, that's enough.  There you go.  Have you heard, uh...  There you go.  What was that thing my brother sent, uh, tweeted?  Was it the Beatniks?  That was the Beatles doing the Led Zeppelin song?  Um...  I think it is.  Well, we have those guys on the show, no?  The Beatles, Zeppelin guys?  Yeah, yeah.  It was, uh...  It's like an amazing version, though, of, uh... 
[02:50:30]  What are they doing?  Great show.  Yeah, it was, uh...  They sound exactly like the Beatles, but doing Zeppelin songs, so...  Wasn't that the band we had in?  Was that the one?  Oh, no, that was Beatletalica.  Yeah, yeah, it was Betalica.  Betalica, right.  But that guy was, like, sounding like, uh, uh, Metallica.  Right.  These guys sound exactly like the Beatles, but they're singing Zeppelin.  Oh, fuck.  I would love to hear that.  Yeah, yeah.  Get that fucking thing.  Did Brother Joe tweet it?  Um, I believe he did. 
[02:51:00]  What's all?  Yes, he did.  It was...  Fuck.  Let me see.  Oh, Joe's Twitter name?  I don't know.  It's probably, like, 2U or something.  It's your brother, though.  You don't know your brother's Twitter name?  I just...  All I gotta do is...  But you know what?  I, uh...  I, uh...  I'll look.  I can find it.  It's all right.  Either that or someone will pop it up over here.  If they, uh, are generous and kind, they will pop it up in front of me on the screen. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, you got it?  It's Joseph Cumia.  Twitter.  Yeah, that's a tough one to remember.  Oh, yeah, that is hard.  Jesus.  How do you spell Cumia?  I mean, I would let you off the hook if you had some weird, bizarre fucking Twitter name,  but you don't even know your brother's Twitter name, which is Joseph Cumia.  That is bad.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I don't think it's...  I don't think he tweeted it.  No.  He didn't tweet it?  I don't see it.  You son of a bitch.  Okay, well, just go to YouTube and put in, uh...  We're in a holding...  No! 
[02:52:00]  We're in a holding pattern, because I gotta hear...  I gotta hear them sounding like the Beatles doing Zeppelin songs.  I'll find, uh...  It's because it's exact.  Oh!  I'll find it.  Uh, thank you, Will and Virginia.  I gotta...  I gotta throw a song out for a second while we find that one.  Go ahead, Will.  I heard this for the first time two days ago.  Go ahead.  Yeah, uh...  Brett Michaels doing a Sublime song.  What I Got.  Hey.  I love Sublime.  Yes.  I'm a big Sublime fan.  And, uh...  Brett Michaels is redoing What I Got.  And, uh...  This is what's bizarre. 
[02:52:30]  It was on, uh...  Hits One.  It's a pop fucking song.  Right.  Do you have, uh...  What I Got by Brett Michaels?  I wasn't...  Fuck it out.  Thank you, Will.  I wasn't sure if I'd like this or not.  Yeah.  I was confused because I heard it on the Pop fucking channel.  Stay away.  Tell me if you like this.  Brett Michaels doing some...  Oh, he already started.  I'm rising to the street.  Light me up that cigarette.  And I'll strap shoes on my feet.  I've got to find a reason. 
[02:53:00]  The reason things went wrong.  I've got to find a reason why my money's all gone.  It's good.  It's...  It's just okay.  I'm not even going to give it a good.  I love Brett Michaels, too.  Sublime's version is amazing.  Oh, yeah.  And this thing is being played a lot.  It's not my favorite Sublime song.  I would prefer Date Raid.  That's my favorite Sublime song.  Date Raid!  Great song. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, I do.  Take all your money.  Give it all to charity.  It's got no rain.  He's not really hitting it.  No.  He's just off.  Just below the song.  Yeah.  All right, Travis.  All right, we found the Beatniks.  It was Stairway to Heaven.  And they have a little video, too, if you go to YouTube and put in Beatniks, Stairway to Heaven. 
[02:54:00]  Beatniks, N-I-X at the end.  Yeah.  All right, hit it.  One, two, three.  One, two, three.  There's a lady in the show.  All the glitters is gold.  And she's buying a stairway to heaven.  That's insane.  She gets there, she knows. 
[02:54:30]  If the stores are closed, with the work she can get, what she came for.  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, there'll be a long down.  It's just that spring clean for the May Queen.  Yes, there are two miles you can go by.  And they look like the Beatles. 
[02:55:00]  Sure do.  Wow, yeah.  Or the black and white elves.  Yeah.  It's just time to change the road you're on.  Except for the real righties.  Yes.  They made a big video on everything.  You get the idea. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  That's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Kind of a goofy...  What are they, Australian?  An Australian Beatles tribute band.  Doing Zeppelin.  Figures my brother would know that.  Right on.  Tribute band fucking Meister.  That's everything.  The reviews on Bret Michaels doing Sublime, not good.  Not good?  Not good.  Well, Danny said it, too. 
[02:56:00]  It sounds too similar to the original, but not good.  No, you can't hit this.  It's not different.  It's not different enough, but it's bad.  Like, if you're covering a song, you need to re-imagine it or do it in your own.  And it just sounded a little too...  Vocally, you've got to be there, too.  Yeah, it just sounded...  He's just short of Bradley's vocals.  He can't hit those high notes.  Yeah, not good.  That Bret Michaels cover is an abortion.  Bradley's rolling in his heroin-riddled grave.  Jesus, dude.  Jesus. 
[02:56:30]  Let's say hi to Jeff in Cleveland.  Jeff?  Hey, here.  Jeff?  Hey, yeah.  One cover I really love.  Chupa Motto, Black Hole Sun.  And they also did the cover of Dumb by Nirvana, but I think the Black Hole Sun's a little bit better.  What do they do with it?  They're kind of an indie J-pop band, so they kind of sing it kind of as a J-pop sarcastic thing with Black Hole Sun.  I don't know what J-pop is.  Japanese pop music.  Okay, I'm sorry.  J-pop.  J-pop.  I've never heard that term before. 
[02:57:00]  Well, let's check it out.  Chuba Motto?  Chuba Motto.  Chuba.  Chuba.  Chuba Motto.  Yeah, it's two chicks.  One of the chicks does, she's in Gorillaz.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Gorillaz is kind of super group.  It's a shame.  It's not coming up?  All right.  It's not coming up.  All right.  Well, if we find it, we'll play it.  Thank you, Jeff.  Dred Zeppelin, we've heard of those guys.  Reggae band doing Zeppelin. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, that's come on.  With Elvis as a singer.  Come on, come on.  We've all heard that.  Danzig, all right.  Now everyone's just calm with their covers.  With their wacky covers.  All right.  Your ex brought up you today, Anthony, on the news here in New York City.  Oh, what happened?  What did I do?  Jill was talking about Anthony on the morning news today.  Uh-oh.  I wonder what that is.  I don't know.  I don't think as a guy, I think he'd be really excited if your woman was bringing in some 
[02:58:00]  dough.  I mean, old school guys might feel threatened by it, but I wouldn't care.  Yeah, but I think it's just, you know, role reversal.  Or more for that one.  Yeah, role reversal.  You just have to put it in the other way.  I mean, listen, if the woman still earns the money, she's still cleaning the toilets,  making the dinner, taking care of the kid, and taking care of you.  Really?  That sounds like a good deal.  Sign me up for that one.  Yeah, right.  Let's check out the roads.  No, Sukhani, I don't want to do the roads yet.  I've got to ask Sukhani a question.  Do you think my ex, Anthony, made more money than I did?  I think he did, but he still cheated.  He did.  That's right.  He did cheat on you. 
[02:58:30]  I forgot about that.  Yeah, what do you think?  What do you think that?  Why did you do that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't get in the mind of Anthony.  I don't know.  And I just saw him a few weeks ago.  Anthony, if you're watching, I know you are out there.  So give me a call.  So if you want us to know about this.  We'll have a group panel discussion here on the show.  All right.  It's a Westchester County.  Let's check in.  How big is your cock? 
[02:59:00]  She found a girl in your closet, and she's being playful on television.  She wants another rat.  How good do you fuck?  What do you got, a big, thick, leg dick that you just, what do you, hit bottom every time?  Did you ruin her shirts in the back?  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Hangar marks.  Dude.  On all her shirts.  How?  She's a 10.  You cheated.  She burned your shit.  And now she's like, you know what? 
[02:59:30]  He really did fuck me well.  I'll be playful on the news.  Goddamn, Jimmy.  My fucking hero.  Holy shit.  That's awe-inspiring.  The fact that she would ever acknowledge you again, much less be playful.  She turns out to be very cool, you know?  Yeah, I like you.  I mean, whatever.  Whatever transpired, transpired.  But she happens to have a sense of humor.  And, you know, she's cool with life and things that happen. 
[03:00:00]  So what are you going to do?  You were very badly behaved.  I never denied how horribly behaved I was during that period of my life.  It was very, very bad.  I was naughty, Anthony.  Oh, you were very...  Naughty, naughty, Anthony.  Very mean-spirited.  I know.  Jesus.  I know.  I was completely to blame.  And I just took it out on whoever the fuck was around. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, you're so hard.  It was very bad.  Very, very naughty of you.  You were very fresh.  Yeah, we're here.  That's a nice hiney right there.  That's terrible.  Jill's hiney.  Is that her hiney?  That's her hiney.  Pictures that are just being pulled up everywhere.  Is she playfully opening up her asshole a little bit in that picture?  I just saw that on that picture.  Playfully?  Danny has found a lot of pictures, a lot of photographs.  Let's go back to Nick at Woodstock.  We were talking about cover bands, and Nick's got a good one.  Nick, go ahead. 
[03:01:00]  Zeppelin.  Hey!  That was a joke.  Zeppelin, if you were.  You killed his spot.  You killed his spot.  Ah, Jimmy.  You just killed his whole fucking call.  Oh, man.  He blew up your brilliant fucking line.  I didn't even.  No, I can't even bother.  At least you know a great comedian just fucked you.  What were you going to say, Nick?  I'm sorry.  He was going to say, talking about Zeppelin covers, just play Zeppelin.  Yeah.  Like, aren't they in, like, a new lawsuit every year for...  Yes, yes, yes.  We're on top of the whole lawsuit thing with Zeppelin. 
[03:01:30]  It doesn't make me happy being a huge Zeppelin fan, but it's getting uglier and uglier as  the years go by.  Yep.  Ryan, Nashville.  Hey, guys.  There's a bluegrass band called The Gourds, and they do Snoop Dogg's Gin and Juice.  Man, it's really cool.  Why is everyone fucking calling with this song?  Yeah, what the fuck?  Are you in The Gourds?  Am I in The Gourds?  Yeah, a lot of people call and say the best cover ever.  Country version of Gin and Juice by The Gourd.  Or The Gourds.  Check it out.  Yeah, it's great.  You got it, Travis?  We'll humor this guy. 
[03:02:00]  I have a good cover, too.  You guys know Gin and Juice, right?  I don't know.  So much drama in the LBC.  It's kind of hard being Snoop D-O-W-G.  But I somehow, someway, keep coming up funky as shit.  Maybe every single day.  And I kick a little something for the G's.  I ain't like a few friends as I breeze through. 
[03:02:30]  Don't you know it's two in the morning and our party's still jumping?  Cause my mama ain't home-home.  I got bitches in the living room getting it home.  And they ain't leaving till six in the morning.  So what you want to do, ho?  I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do, too.  Turn off the lights and close the doors. 
[03:03:00]  But, but, what?  We don't have them whores.  And we gonna smoke an ounce to that.  Cheese up, ho, is down like you motherfuckers.  Fast to that.  Ho, ho, ho.  And I'll be rolling down it straight, smoking it home,  sipping on tinny juice, laid back.  On my mind, on my money, on my money, on my mind.  Rolling down it straight, smoking it home,  sipping on tinny juice, laid back. 
[03:03:30]  On my mind, on my money, on my money, on my money, on my mind.  Unique.  Hey, I like that, though.  It's got a little bluegrass feel to it.  Yeah, I like that.  What was the one that Brother Joe did?  Kind of sounded like James Teller.  Oh, that was the James Teller one.  Yeah, it was...  It was DMX, right?  DMX.  Yeah, up in here, right?  Up in here.  Up in here.  Yeah, Brother Joe did a great version of that.  Yeah, listen to this.  James Teller version. 
[03:04:00]  We should be playing this on Sirius XM.  Yeah, right?

[03:05:30]  While you go  Find yourself buried next to someone else  And we all thought you'd love yourself  But that couldn't have been the issue  Or maybe they just saying that  Now cause they may miss you shit  A nigga tried to diss you  That's why you're laying on your back  Looking at the roof of the church  Preacher telling the truth

[03:07:00]  That is fucking funny.  The suck my dick part, something like James Taylor's singing suck my dick.  It is funny, man.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Tool doing Zeppelin's No Quarter.  Yeah, I've heard that before.  That's a good one.  Holy shit, is that good.  I could see how that would probably work.  Alien Ant Farm doing Land of Confusion.  They do a good version of Michael Jackson's Smooth Criminal, too.  Wait, who?  Disturbed cover Land of Confusion.  Yeah, it was, right? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I didn't think that was right.  Disturbed.  Disturbed did a great version of Land of Confusion.  Yeah.  Makes that song cool.  I love this weird...  Also did Shout.  Yes.  Right.  Yeah.  You know who Skiffle Dog is?  Skiffle Dog?  No.  No.  It's an Irish singer, I think.  Did a version of John Lennon's Working Class Hero.  It's really good.  Yeah?  Do we have it?  I don't know.  I like Working Class Hero.  It's one of my favorite Lennon's movies.  Travis, working today, yo! 
[03:08:00]  By the way, on the news, a mother drowned her kids in the lake, and she is a black woman.  So again...  Again!  What is going on?  That's a white fucking crime.  More black people doing white people crimes.  That's three in a row.  I like it.  What's the three now?  You got the black guy shooting up his workplace.  Yes.  That's so a white guy thing.  Yep.  Yep.  The drowning is a white mother thing.  Oh, the guy throwing semen on people.  Right.  That's a white guy crime.  Yeah, that's a white guy crime.  Mothers drowning their kids in a white lady crime, and the blacks are losing their minds. 
[03:08:30]  Yep.  What are they doing?  I'm telling you, that's how you know that we really are becoming one.  One people.  As a society.  Let's go do a drive-by today.  We're all committing the same crimes.  Yeah.  The same heinous crimes.  That's so sweet.  Yeah, she's horrible.  Wow.  She looked like Precious.  Yeah, she's not a pretty lady.  Did you find it, Travis?  Who sang it again?  I'm sorry.  I'm looking up five different things.  Travis fail.  No.  I might have it.  No.  He just denies it. 
[03:09:00]  He goes, no, no, no, no, because I'm looking up other stuff.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's how Travis gets out of things.  No, no, no.  That didn't happen.  No, he might be right.  What else are you looking up?  I was looking up.  No, no.  We've got a full phone.  No, no, no.  Ah, Skiffle Dog.  S-K-I-F-F.  No, I don't have it.  What?  I believe you, but that's weird.  We should have it.  Which cover do you like on the phones, Travis?  I want to hear Sabotage by Cancer Bats, Brian in Detroit.  Cancer Bats? 
[03:09:30]  Because I love the song Sabotage.  What could they possibly have done with that?  See, they're doing Careless Whisper is pretty cool.  Because Careless Whisper is a fake and fake song.  Fake!  You want to talk about Seether making a song on their own?  They certainly did with that Careless Whisper.  Yeah.  How come people don't like my blueberries?  Oh, God.  What a nice sucking sound.  I'm sorry.  Oh, the Scissor Sisters did comfortably know them. 
[03:10:00]  The Scissor Sisters.  The Scissor Sisters?  The Scissor Sisters.  They're a couple of doikes, right?  What do you got, Travis?  The Scissor Sisters.  I have that Cancer Bats doing Sabotage.  Oh.  Yeah, let's hear Sabotage.  This is for Brian in Detroit.  Weird way to start the song.  All right.  Holy shit. 
[03:10:30]  Holy shit.  Oh my God.  You can fade out. 
[03:11:00]  I like it, though.  And that's my line where vocals go.  As far as hardcore goes?  That's as far as I want to hear.  Because after that, it's that throat shit.  Even that's cutting it kind of close.  It's close.  I was at the limit, though.  Because he's still holding some kind of melodic thing going on there.  Then it just turns into...  As far as vocals go, that's the top of my register right there.  That's where, right after that, it gets crazy for me.  And it's a good song for it, too. 
[03:11:30]  Is that a Beastie Boys song, Sabotage?  Oh, yeah, it is.  Sabotage is one of the greatest fucking songs made in the last 20 years.  That is a great Beastie Boys song, man.  That version reminds me of a little band that used to be cool, Limp Bizkit.  And their version of Faith.  Oh, right.  That fucking thing.  That broke that band.  You got Faith?  Yeah, hang on.  Did you hear their new single?  Why would I?  What?  Is it still around?  I'm done with Limp Bizkit.  You sure you don't want to hear it?  No, no.  All right. 
[03:12:00]  Hang on.  Limp Bizkit was never cool.  No desire to hear what they're up to.  They were cool for 10 minutes.  Come on, give it to them.  Let me hear Faith, though.  A little piece of Faith.  I think it's like a two-minute version, too.  He just fucking gets right into it.  You ever hear this, Jimmy?  No, who's this?  Limp Bizkit.  Oh, I heard the original.  Back in the day.  I blew someone in the bushes to this song.  I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body.  He makes it his own song.  Now listen to that.  He's got a body like me.  With a small dick. 
[03:12:30]  Fat.  They're so nasty.  They're so nasty.  Get ready.  Here we go.  Here we go.  This is so spicy.  How was he?  Here we go.  Get ready.  This is so spicy.

But, wow, it's blowing up on Twitter.  Keep it going.  By the way, Mike suggested.  Best cover ever on Twitter.  A lot of people suggesting some great songs.  Mike Cole suggested another one.  It's a cool cover of Mob Rules by a band called Heaven and Hell.
