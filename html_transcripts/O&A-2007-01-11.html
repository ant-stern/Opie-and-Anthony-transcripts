<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts complaining bitterly about a forced, three-day trip to Las Vegas for a three-minute presentation at CES for CBS, orchestrated by Les Moonves,  despite prior commitments and their desire to stay on the air. This was contrasted with a listener's criticism of their infrequent broadcasts. Opie then launched into a bizarre story about a red-eye flight from Vegas where a panicked flight attendant thought his girlfriend had vanished, only to find a different unconscious woman in the galley.  Lindsay, Opie's girlfriend, eventually emerged from the bathroom, resolving the confusion. Anthony claimed to have slept through the whole thing.  Patrice O'Neal filled in for Jim Norton, who was at the AVN Awards.  Several listener calls followed, detailing their own strange airplane experiences, including a mid-flight death and an assault on a flight attendant.  The discussion also covered the perceived decline in flight attendant quality.

The show then shifted to a brief discussion of *The Wire*, followed by a humorous anecdote about a long-winded caller, John from Ozone Park.  Patrice O'Neal's upcoming stand-up shows were promoted.  Further listener calls recounted unusual in-flight events: Mike from the Bronx described a fellow passenger dying mid-flight to Ireland, and another detailed a scorpion repeatedly stinging a passenger. This led to a comedic discussion about the relative dangers of African versus American wildlife, and the incongruity of seeing modern clothing on people in African documentaries.  The hosts then discussed an extravagant XM Radio club night in Vegas, contrasting its lavishness with the company's recent layoffs. They detailed their own experience at the club, noting the high cost and the difficulty of conversation.  A significant portion focused on a YouTube video of David Caruso from *CSI: Miami*, featuring his dramatically delivered one-liners and sunglasses-putting-on habit.  The hosts and callers dissected Caruso's over-the-top acting style.  Several callers also discussed how they listened to the show and one recounted a scheme involving a company credit card and lobsters.  The segment concluded with more Caruso clips and discussion.

Next, the hosts discussed a German comedy about Hitler, debating the appropriateness of Holocaust humor versus jokes about Nazis, referencing *Hogan's Heroes* and Three Stooges shorts.  The conversation switched to a New York City Fire Department controversy regarding locker decorations, sparked by a vandalized picture of a woman.  A retired NYC paramedic, Eddie, called in to express his outrage. Anthony recounted two recent positive interactions with NYPD officers, contrasting his experiences with those of Black individuals, sparking a discussion about racial bias in police interactions with Patrice O'Neal's participation.  The final segment previewed their "Money Snatch" segment, criticizing its degrading promotional announcement and brainstorming alternative approaches.  A call from Steve at the AVN Adult Entertainment Expo in Vegas added discussion about the porn industry, HD filming, and a humorous anecdote about a "bear" at the expo.  The show briefly mentioned Mark McGwire's exclusion from the Baseball Hall of Fame before ending.

The broadcast continued with a brief discussion about a previous segment featuring Kenny's failed celebrity photo attempts, mentioning a Gene Simmons encounter.  This was followed by a bizarre, cryptic call from Steve who, after initially refusing to share gossip, shouted "What are you doing in my fucking house? Get the fuck out. Now!" before hanging up.  The hosts speculated on the reason.  Shwuggy then recommended porn star Sunny Lane, leading to discussion of her appearance, including comments about her weight and a comparison of her facial hair to a Hitler mustache. Eric from Nebraska suggested playing a previous promo featuring Steve's involvement in a money-snatching scheme. A significant portion focused on E-Rock's significant weight gain, with humorous and insulting banter about his appearance. A registered dietician called in to clarify the science of weight gain. A bet was made regarding E-Rock's weight loss, with a $100 wager and the consequence of E-Rock wearing a "I'm a fat fuck" sign if he failed. E-Rock participated in a Chubby Bunny challenge, tying the show record.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the authenticity of "Man vs. Wild" and "Survivor Man."


The show heavily featured vulgar language and offensive topics, with Patrice O'Neal as a guest. A major segment focused on news anchor Jim Cobb, who shouted "fuck off, Buzz" on live television, and his subsequent firing. Another major segment involved a graphic description of the "Money Snatch" contest, featuring naked women scrambling for cash in body orifices; caller Lauren showed initial interest but became hesitant. Further discussions included Opie's lack of deodorant, a story about a rapist targeting the wrong victim, and a highly offensive debate about which holidays the hosts would celebrate, using racial and ethnic slurs, particularly regarding Martin Luther King Jr. Day, culminating in comedic, offensive skits mocking King's "I Have a Dream" speech.  The show concluded with a listener voicemail.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw up with failures, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a whore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee, oh do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Northen, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled, 
[00:00:30]  why are you crying, the virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the Opie and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today, AIDS, I hate you, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road, 
[00:01:00]  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America, our phone number 1-866-313-FREE, I start with this instant feedback from Greg from Aquabog, New York.  And that out east somewhere, I have no idea where Aquabog is, but he writes, I'm a big fan since WNAW days, but what's going on, you guys complain about Stern, you're never on, what, one new show in the past month, great way to build that free FM audience, repeat after repeat after repeat, 
[00:01:30]  All right, I completely agree with Greg, I'll agree with Greg wholeheartedly, I completely agree with Greg, we are live, it's January 11th, in the year, the 007, the 007, yes, and I think this is our third show in the last month and a half, yeah, Christ, 
[00:02:00]  Christ, but behind the scenes, I did bitch, and I did complain, and so did Anthony, that we did not want to go to Vegas for three days to get on the stage and talk for three minutes about the pal talk cameras that we use here on the Opie and Anthony show,  Yeah, coming off going to the show, coming off going to do Jay Leno, where you have to take two or three days off to get that done, and then the scheduled Christmas vacation, we decide we want to take a good week this year, so we did that, 
[00:02:30]  We needed that, and then, uh, uh, they're like, no, we need you in Vegas for the CES, Les Moonves himself invited you guys to talk at his keynote, you guys have to do this, and I'm arguing behind the scenes, like, we're in no position to take any time off,  No. Past, you know, uh, obviously the Christmas time. We rather would have been here doing the program, that's what we do. We flew out to Vegas for three days to talk for three minutes on a stage, 
[00:03:00]  It was a complete waste of time when it comes to our world. A complete waste of time. The keynote would have been just as great without us.  Yeah, if they wanted us for something, we could have done it here, and they could have, like, put it up on the video screen. Something, yeah, like that.  They didn't have to be there.  And we were on, uh, their schedule, uh, corporate schedule. They needed us out there early to practice. Practice for what? I don't know, because we wing everything anyway. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my God, I know. We had to do rehearsal. We had to do rehearsals on Monday, then we had to sit around all day Tuesday for a four-hour dress rehearsal, even though our part was only three minutes.  It was like the Oscars. Yeah.  And this huge room with a big, elaborate stage and lighting and different sections of the stage where different people did their thing.  And we just kind of stroll out and go, hey, this is what we do now.  This is what we do. Let's show you a tape of us, uh, using the Paltalk camera. 
[00:04:00]  Everyone else is, like, standing there looking at the teleprompter.  Well, thank you, Les.  I'm here to talk about the latest, uh, thing.  All reading off the teleprompter.  Me and Op just kind of stumble out.  Hey, what's going on?  By the way, we got, uh, wave, uh, wave, uh, rage reviews, rage, rave.  We got rage reviews, but it's CES, rave.  You got angry reviews?  You got angry reviews.  Well, yeah, from us.  From our listeners, yes, we got angry reviews from our listeners. 
[00:04:30]  Where the hell are you guys?  Where are you?  And I asked that same question in Vegas.  Of course, the CES is the consumer electronic, uh, show, I guess.  Yeah.  And Les Mouvez, you know, who runs CBS.  It's just, like, State of the Union.  Right.  He gets out there and goes, how, and talks about how great everything is in radio and  TV and on the internet and, and we're working on this deal and that deal.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Well, this year, that was the big, uh, technology thing.  How is CBS going to, uh, align itself with all those different technologies that are coming 
[00:05:00]  out?  And one was radio.  And, uh, we were chosen to go out there and talk about how we are using technology  computers and whatnot to, um, get our audience in as a community, a worldwide community  to the Opie and Anthony show through technology of computers.  That's what we were doing.  Yeah.  Pretty much talking about PalTalk and how we, uh, have cameras here and people at home 
[00:05:30]  have cameras and, uh, and that kind of opens up the show to a virtual guests and things  like that based on, uh, what they're doing on PalTalk.  Uh, other things they talk about.  I don't know.  I left when we were done.  Oh yeah.  So I had to leave.  Well, we had to catch a flight back.  Yeah.  And then, so we caught a flight Tuesday night, 11 45 PM, Vegas time.  That would be two 45 New York time.  Okay.  Two 45 in the morning. 
[00:06:00]  How's that work?  I know.  Whatever.  Time travel.  So, uh, so then we had to fly all night.  Uh, and I think, I think we arrived at Newark yesterday morning at 10 AM.  It was 10 o'clock in the morning.  I'm not really sure.  When we got into Newark.  Wednesday did not exist in, in my life.  Cause I remember thinking, okay, if we were doing the show, uh, we'd have an hour left.  Right.  It was like, my God, that took forever.  So I completely agree with Greg.  We had no business taking another three days off to go out to Vegas to do a dumb corporate 
[00:06:30]  thing.  Yeah.  A stupid corporate thing.  We went down to West Palm beach for a stupid corporate thing.  We're in no position with this radio show to be doing these, these things.  We need to settle down in these seats and pump out good radio.  I hate corporate things.  So leave us alone and let us do what we're good at.  Yeah.  Let us just sit and do the show on a daily basis.  No more interruptions with corporate things. 
[00:07:00]  Ooh, too many days off.  He's absolutely right.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not going to hide behind, uh, his instant feedback.  He's a hundred percent right.  What do you think?  We get like a crap load of vacation days every year.  Do you think that's what we're doing?  Taking vacation.  You think we're popping out for sick days on any given day?  We're in here with like the croup.  Yeah.  If we, if we ever had the croup, I don't even know what that is, Opie, but if we had  it, I'd be in here doing this show and we'd all get the croup.  Since coming back to regular radio last April, we really didn't take much time off. 
[00:07:30]  We took us, what?  A summer vacation.  Yeah.  And then the end of the year, we're like, you know what?  We really want to enjoy Christmas this year.  We'll take from Christmas to New Year's off.  And then after we scheduled that time off, Jay Leno came to call, which is, uh, which  is an awesome, great thing for us.  Can't turn that down.  Can't turn that down.  So then all of a sudden you tack on another three days to, uh, your vacation.  And then on top of that, then they're like, well, and we also want you out in Vegas for  this corporate thing.  A few days later.  So that's another three days you tack on to taking off. 
[00:08:00]  Next thing you know, you, you haven't done a show in two, two and a half weeks.  That's right.  But anyways, we're back.  It's live.  Uh, it's, uh, January 11th.  Oh, seven Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's out in Vegas doing the porn awards.  And, uh, we were just talking before the show started that, uh, we had to take the middle  of the night, creepy flight home.  The red eye.  They call it the red eye.  The red eye.  I'm sure a lot of people, uh, know exactly what we're talking about, but I hate flying  in general.  We've flown so much in the last two years. 
[00:08:30]  I'm kind of dealing with it finally, but I'm, I, I'm still really bad.  When it comes to flying in the middle of the night, it's just creepy time.  It's just creepy time.  You try to, you try to doze off and, and, and it, you just feel like you're entering into  a nightmare.  Like you feel every bump.  You're looking out the window.  Everything is just creepy.  Hurtling through the cosmos in the pitch darkness.  And they don't help things because they turn all the lights off in the plane.  Kind of like that.  You know, it ain't the starting team doing the plane. 
[00:09:00]  You know, it's not the AT, right?  God, you know what?  I never even thought of it that way.  You know that like the real dudes don't, don't fly the red eye flight with the, they get the  nice time, you know, they get to pick and choose.  Oh, I'm flying during the day.  I got, I got a life at night.  You know this day that he's a two, he's a two-star guy.  The five-star guys fly to, you know, fly those 10 hour flights in the daytime.  You're trying to think of radio thinking, you know, who's on from like midnight to four  in the morning.  Some drug addict. 
[00:09:30]  It's not, you know, usually it's not like the best show in the world.  The pilot has that voice.  Hey, everybody.  How you doing?  We're on the red eye tonight.  Oh, he's way too excited.  Got to fly, baby.  He's way too excited to be there because he's only done seven flights.  Oh, man.  He's still just excited to be there.  He's long at hours.  It's Dr. Volta.  Yeah, from the flight deck, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to thank you for coming on board.  And everybody from our Cleveland-based crew would also like to say hi. 
[00:10:00]  And let me tell you something.  We're going to give away rock concert tickets to anyone sitting in row 29.  Row 29, give us a call right now in the flight deck, and we'll be giving away those tickets.  Woo!  Dude!  That's me!  Dude!  Patrice, Patrice.  I'll be back on the speaker after these words.  I hate you.  I never thought of it that way.  Basically, you're saying we had day strippers flying the plane.  Yeah, you have day strippers.  Day strippers.  What person that's number one does anything at night? 
[00:10:30]  The worst security guards are doing security at night.  The worst bus drivers.  You ever go to the Port Authority at night sometimes and just go through there?  It's just frightening.  The worst.  You know who works at three in the morning?  Janitors.  That's who flew you back.  Janitors flew the plane.  And it didn't help that we had to fly into Cleveland, so what kind of staff are you getting  out of Cleveland?  Yeah, we had to get...  Because, you know...  Both ways, from New York to Cleveland to Vegas, and then from Vegas to Cleveland to New York. 
[00:11:00]  So you hear that.  Sorry, Cleveland.  And from the entire Cleveland-based crew, we'd like to say Cleveland-based.  Cleveland-based.  Some depressed pilot is like...  Oh, I know.  He's just angry.  Some depressed guy out of Cleveland is like, oh, my girl just left me.  It is a mountain to the left.  I should just...  I could ram right into that lake.  You know they think it every time.  I could just take off and dip it face-first right into the lake.  You know some of these guys think it every time.  Like, you know what?  I could kill Opie and Anthony right now.  And then at the last second, like, all right, well, maybe tomorrow will be a better day. 
[00:11:30]  A man cow fan is flying.  A suicidal man cow fan is flying.  I'm just going to crash this thing.  Screw them.  It's true.  You're just not getting the number one team.  No, no, no.  They ask me when I want to fly.  I go the early morning white businessman flight.  That's what I like.  They want to keep people alive.  You're early.  You get where you want to go early. 
[00:12:00]  I like flying when there's plenty of sunshine.  It takes away all that creepiness.  That creepiness.  Or an overnight flight that's not a red eye.  Like a flight that needs to be overnight.  Because it's so long.  Starts in the day.  You're going to Tokyo.  Exactly, where you're changing times.  I don't mind that, but when you're going from Cleveland to Newark at 4.30 in the morning.  Whatever it was.  That's what it was.  It was just...  Middle of the night.  Middle of the night.  The flight crew couldn't...  Like Ope said, the flight attendants didn't know who was dropping on the floor. 
[00:12:30]  All right.  Yeah.  I got to get into that.  They're tapping other people.  Let me get into that story.  And the pilot wears their own clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not even pilot clothes.  So Patrice, the story I'm about to tell you, now it all makes sense because you explained  it so eloquently.  Better than I'm explaining right now.  They are day strippers.  You're getting not the greatest crew to fly in the middle of the night.  So we fly out of Vegas and I'm out cold because now we've been up close to 24 hours or whatever 
[00:13:00]  it would be.  I don't know.  Figure out the time zone and all that crap, but pretty much we've been up a very long time.  So surprisingly, I was able to, in my world, I was able to fall asleep, which I'm amazed  because every bump I'm waking up and I'm just creeped out.  But I'm out cold.  And the last I remember, I was out cold up against the window.  My girlfriend was right next to me.  She's all bundled in her blanket and she's got a pillow on my shoulder.  So all is well with the world. 
[00:13:30]  Okay.  Flying back to New York.  Love on the red eye.  She's right next to me.  I'm out cold.  She's sleeping.  All is good.  Right?  I am woken up.  I don't know if I was sleeping five minutes or two hours.  I have no clue.  No clue.  All disoriented.  Yeah.  I wake up, I'm completely disoriented and I got a stewardess in my face in a panic.  Obviously, she's part of the B or C team, not the A team, because I think the A team would  have handled this a little differently.  She just, she shakes me awake and she's got this panicked look on her face. 
[00:14:00]  I'm like, oh, you need to fly the plane.  It might as well have been.  Yeah.  You're hoping, you've worked a board at a radio station.  That's the closest we've got to someone that knows how to fly this plane.  You have flying experience?  No.  And then she goes out to the next person, just shaking everyone away.  Just shake them.  So I'm awoken by this stewardess in a complete panic and she's just shaking me and I'm looking  her right in the eye and she goes, was your girlfriend just sitting here? 
[00:14:30]  And I turned and I turned and remember, all I remember was me all snuggled up next to  the window.  So my girl is on my shoulder, all is well with the world.  Now she wakes me up in a complete panic and goes, was your girlfriend sitting right there?  I go, yeah.  Now you're thinking, what?  She's jumping?  That's what I'm going to say.  The first thing you think is you're waiting for the air that's pushing your face against  the back of the chair.  Yeah.  Because the door's open.  Right.  And she's informing you your girl just jumped out of the gut. 
[00:15:00]  Or some kind of Goldfinger thing happened where the window got blown out and she just got  sucked right out.  And the only way we can keep flying is she stays on the window.  Was she here?  So dude, middle of the night, all lights are off except some ass that has to catch up on  his reading at four in the morning.  And so now I see an empty seat start the Twilight Zone moment here.  I'm like, what the F?  She goes, was she taking any medication?  I go, no, not that I know of.  Now you're thinking, yeah, she went crazy and jumped out of the window. 
[00:15:30]  No, I'm thinking right away, where is she?  She's staying.  This is the thing about dramatic people.  Okay, you go, wake up for a second.  Is everything a mystery building up?  Like this thing that is really causing you to actually panic more?  Of course.  Like she's like, oh my God, is your girlfriend there?  It's like, what?  Yeah.  Does she take medication?  Like she's putting things in your head so that you can start imagining your girlfriend's 
[00:16:00]  problem.  Is there any way she could have gotten a gun on the plane?  Like you're waiting for that stuff to start coming out of her mouth.  Right.  What the hell?  Right.  She's seeing men on the wing.  And keep in mind, you know, up almost 24 hours, flying in the middle of the night, which  is a creepy time to begin with.  She's in a complete panic.  The stewardess was she sitting there.  I look, empty seat, just a little pillow askew on the seat.  I'm like, what the F? 
[00:16:30]  Right?  And she goes, was she on any medication?  I said, not that I know of.  What are you doing now?  Are you standing up?  Are you still, I'm still trying to, I'm, I'm trying to like, you know, digest everything  that's going on.  Cause I was, I was out cold.  Got to wrap your mind around it.  It's bad enough to wake up to a, on those flights.  It's bad enough to be nudged, woken up and going, do you want a cookie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like that gets you like, ah, well cookies, what type is a chocolate chip or own meal?  Ah, you know, you freak out at that. 
[00:17:00]  Nevermind.  Did you have a girlfriend sitting here?  She's not turning up on our, uh, uh, roster of passengers.  She never existed.  I just want to let you know, she never existed.  Yeah.  Like I thought, but she was here.  Flight plan.  Flight plan.  Yeah.  My daughter.  I don't know.  No, she was never here.  Sorry.  Did you see my girlfriend?  I don't know.  No.  Everything from thinking, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm realizing my girlfriend's actually  an alien and decided to go back to her home planet.  I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, and you know, that's a viable option at that point. 
[00:17:30]  I know she wrote in her language.  Yeah.  Right.  It's a Stargate map to where she lives.  If you want to come, you just, but that's completely reasonable when you're just shocked  awake at 35,000 feet.  Right.  In the middle of like Idaho or wherever the hell we're over.  She went back to Glorock 12.  Yeah.  Glorock.  So.  It's my minium dad's.  So.  Galaxy, my mouth ain't awake.  So it gets better.  It actually gets better.  So woken up from a, from a, from a, you know, a solid sleep girlfriend, completely gone. 
[00:18:00]  Stewart's in a complete panic.  Her arms are still around me that she used to shake me violently awake.  Shook you awake.  Nice.  Was she on medication?  She's looking me in the eye.  Was she on medication?  I'm like, no, not that I know of.  And then she goes, you better come with me.  Oh no.  I'm like, what?  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  There's only so many places to go on a plane.  And where we're going is going to look exactly like where we are now. 
[00:18:30]  Right.  So there must be a problem somewhere else on this aircraft.  Where the hell is she?  Did she go to the back of the plane?  Is she in the cockpit?  Is she, did she decide if she's a stewardess and went crazy?  I don't know.  Was there ever any moment where you thought anything bad of her?  Like, she's in the back, she's in the back sleeping with a guy in row 12.  Yeah, right.  Oh my God.  Right.  This hoe is kissing somebody in the back.  Yeah, right?  You start thinking all the crap.  Mile high club and you're not even involved.  Sir, is your, is your, is your, is your girlfriend faithful you think? 
[00:19:00]  What?  Oh no.  Wait, wait, wait.  What?  Everything was worried about.  It was nothing where you go.  Yeah.  It was no point where you go, what the, what is she doing?  You can run the gamut of problems and not one of them can be canceled out.  Like anything is open.  And it was, and by the way, it was a 737, relatively small aircraft.  So it's not like, where is she?  Is she up in the lounge of the 747?  One of those double decker air buses, you know?  Just four, um, like, uh, first class seats or something like that. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, there's like four rows up front and then, you know, a few in the back.  And so she can't go anywhere.  So we're up to the point where the stewardess goes, you better come with me.  Now I'm like, wow, wow.  There's something serious going on.  How long would you say from the time you woke up to the time you better come with me had went by?  It couldn't have been more than a second and a half.  That's the panic the stewardess had.  She got all that out.  Shook me, was she sitting here, medication, better come with me, all within, I would say, a second and a half. 
[00:20:00]  So now I stumble up, I'm banging into people, and I go to the front of the plane with the stewardess, right?  And all of a sudden, this is what I see.  And remember, I swear I've only been awake for a matter of seconds.  Still rubbing crusties out of your eyes.  I see a girl completely out cold on her back where they make your coffee and your meals.  The forward galley.  Out cold on her back, arms, like, out to her sides. 
[00:20:30]  Like in the Jesus Christ position.  So it's your girl?  Dude, because I'm barely awake, I have no doubt it's my girlfriend.  I have no doubt your mind ain't working.  Well, my mind's not working, and the stewardess set me up that something horrific happened to your girlfriend.  I see the empty seat, I'm like, oh, my God.  Did she have the basic physical attributes?  That's what I said to you.  Oh, my God, my girl is dead, and she's fat now.  My girlfriend got high cholesterol, had a heart attack. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, and you feed her.  Stealing Twinkies, oh, God, no.  So, this girl is out cold, looks dead, ashen.  Is that a good word to use?  I mean, she is, like, not the color of a human being.  Just zombie, zombie wife.  Completely out on her back.  Completely out on her back.  What color is her hair?  Well, after I woke up, I realized that this girl's hair was kind of a black woman with a big afro. 
[00:21:30]  Kind of reddish with a little brown in it, which is a little different than...  She was a midget with one leg, and...  But, listen...  You don't even think that, though, like, in that situation.  But, Streis, you know what?  You're 100% right.  All you see is a girl on the ground, and you think, uh-oh.  Right.  Dude, my powerful girlfriend died, and then she turned into an ugly wig.  I knew she was from Oz. 
[00:22:00]  But, look, man, the stewardess sent me up, wakes me up.  There's an empty seat where I knew she was.  We're on a plane.  I'm like, what are the odds that this dope doesn't know what she's talking about?  Especially...  We're up to the front of the plane.  Here's a girl completely out, ashen white.  I'm like, maybe I don't recognize her, because she's dead.  Yeah.  Especially dead.  This is what happens when you die.  Seriously.  I've seen dead people, unfortunately, and you don't look the same as you did alive. 
[00:22:30]  Not on a plane, but...  No, not on a plane.  And the whole thing in the front of the plane is where the flight attendants are and stuff.  They should know.  That should be the place that they know everything that's going on.  Right.  That little area where they just hang out.  You can understand if it's, like, halfway through the plane or something happens, you know, they'd be a little confused.  But it's right where they hang out.  That's their office in the sky.  Can I ask you another question?  This is a fascinating story, man.  Was there any other people around this dead body, like, that was doing something as this other woman? 
[00:23:00]  Like, was it like, all right, oh, my God, I think she was sitting in 4B.  Yeah.  Go get the man.  No, no, no, no, no, this girl fell down, like, seconds before the stewardess woke me up.  It all just was happening in the moment.  It was just a dead woman by herself with a cornflakes on her.  With one stewardess already on her knees, like, trying to figure out what to do, and the other stewardess deciding that it was my girlfriend and I need to be on the scene immediately because she might want to say, you know, goodbye to you. 
[00:23:30]  She might have a final message.  I'm not kidding, dude.  That's how, that's the feeling I got.  Buckle your seatbelt.  So now I'm looking at this girl that in my.  Get a refund.  In my mind.  Yeah.  Voucher.  I'm looking at this girl.  Upgrade.  Boom.  So at this point, I'm looking at this girl that looks like she could be on her last breath, could be dead.  They already said it's my girlfriend.  I'm like, I'm ready to go into into holy ass complete panic mode. 
[00:24:00]  Like, start screaming, somebody do something.  We got to land this plane.  I'm ready to go into whatever you have to say and do.  Something's missing from this story, too.  I really wish we could get Opie's real what he really did.  You know a tear was coming.  No, dude, honestly, come on.  We're pretty honest in the show.  It was, it was all just happening and panic.  Yes.  I'm not kidding.  Just when I was about to like drop to my knees and go into holy ass panic mode, the bathroom door opens up and there's Lindsay. 
[00:24:30]  And I'm like, like, hey, what's happening?  And I'm like, my brain cannot, cannot digest what's going on at this point.  Cannot.  I'm like, what the?  And now I swear, because I just woke up.  I mean, it's key to the story that this whole thing went down in less than like five seconds at this point.  Hope you had a nice Arnold.  My stupid brain at this point goes, is that like her spirit? 
[00:25:00]  That's what happens when you die.  You go to an airliner bathroom.  I'm like, is she now like an angel saying goodbye to me or something?  Because this all just happened.  Like she just died.  And here's a spirit lifting out of her body.  And I guess she had to relieve herself before she went to heaven.  Jeff Slice, a Quinn Martin production.  Was there a guy behind her making a clay pot with her? 
[00:25:30]  She walks out of the bathroom at the moment.  I'm ready to go into holy ass panic mode.  Now, immediately, I'm thinking she's an angel and she just stepped out of her body.  And then I finally was able to figure out what's going on.  I'm like, oh, my God, it's not her.  A case of mistaken identity at 35,000 feet.  A Quinn Martin production.  She walks out of the bathroom. 
[00:26:00]  I'm like, what?  Which goes to show you the red-eye staff did not see your girl get up and walk to the bathroom and be in there as a fat woman passed out.  And the stupid tape they play before you take off talking about their highly trained staff or whatever.  You'll be flying with some of the best people in the business.  Really?  This girl didn't peek out the captain's.  Hey, what's up?  What's happening?  I was just chilling up here.  Right.  I don't know.  Pressing some buttons. 
[00:26:30]  Hey, there's a comfortable seat here.  I was just chilling.  And this just goes to show you what we're all about.  I truly believe I'm not the only one that would do this.  So Lindsay walks out of the bathroom.  I realized it's not a ghost or her spirit or her as an angel saying goodbye before she has to now, you know, go off to heaven.  Thanks for, you know, 35,000 feet.  I don't have to go now.  I don't have to go as far.  I don't have to fly that with my new angel wings.  I got a little head start.  You can just drop me off right here. 
[00:27:00]  So I grab her hand.  I go, and I just walk back to my seat, not giving a crap about this person anymore.  Step over the body on the floor.  I absolutely did.  Wait a minute.  But just for still in the air karma purposes, you didn't go, you didn't rub the lady's hair and go, my God, get well and just go away and try to keep it.  No.  Try to keep the plane in the air.  At this point, I didn't want to know her name.  I didn't know what was wrong.  I didn't want to know what was wrong with her.  You're just looking at watching her.  How much more sleep can I get? 
[00:27:30]  Matter of fact, not even in interest enough to find out whatever happened to her.  Couldn't give a flying F.  Go back.  And your girl's like, what happened?  You're like, oh, this lady up here was dead, and I thought it was you.  Go back to my seat, and then the plane's in panic mode.  Did this wake you up, by the way?  Hey, I was just going to say that.  I slept.  You were on the plane during the death of his girl?  I was right next to him.  I was like right across the aisle from this whole thing that was going on. 
[00:28:00]  A little in front of me.  I was so asleep that all I heard, and I remember this.  I just kind of opened one eye, and I heard a flight attendant go, do we have a doctor or an EMT on board the plane?  Please come to the front of the aircraft.  Dude.  And I looked over.  I saw my girl was next to me.  I looked at me.  I was fine.  So I went right back to sleep.  Obi's girl was missing, and you said, ugh.  I didn't care.  I did not care. 
[00:28:30]  And I'm thinking, you know, if you need a doctor or an EMT on an airplane, it's probably something serious.  I'm fine.  My seat's fine.  My little space at 35,000 feet was okay.  Back to sleep.  And now that I saw that Lindsay was all right, I didn't give a – I didn't care.  I'm like, ah, dead girl.  They'll figure it out.  So just like every movie, they're like, is there a doctor on board?  Any nurses, doctors, EMTs?  And then just a sea of doctors.  It's nice to know there's a lot of doctors on the flight. 
[00:29:00]  It's going to suck to be a doctor.  It's like, I just wanted a flight.  And you can see these doctors were woken up.  They're all, like, disheveled.  And all I know is because I honestly didn't care.  She laid on that floor, that woman for – I don't know.  I asked Lindsay later on.  She said at least an hour, two hours, she laid on that floor.  They finally got her up, got her to her seat, and there was an ambulance waiting when we touched down in Cleveland.  When we pulled up to the gate, there were all kinds of flashing lights at the gate.  And then we pulled in, and usually they take the sick person out first. 
[00:29:30]  Just – we're all grabbing our crap out of the overheads and dragging them.  Oh, yeah.  We didn't care.  We got off the plane, and later on we heard something about her stomach.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't know either.  I had a rumor.  Well, I slept through the whole thing.  This is the first time I'm hearing that.  They made the announcement about the doctor.  Oh, you don't even know?  The lady woke me up to bring my seat up because they had to get, like, the medical kit behind my chair.  Yes, behind your seat.  And then they had, like, these big garbage bags, so I guess she got sick on herself, and 
[00:30:00]  she had to change or whatever.  I slept through the whole thing.  You're damn near a U.S. air marshal type of dude.  Yeah, and he's just snoring.  He's snoring away.  So this is the first time I'm hearing of the doctor announcement.  I slept right through it.  Oh, yeah, man.  And then there was, like, this commotion, and I didn't care.  Now I'm just sitting in the seat.  I'm glad she's okay.  And I remember thinking to myself, this woman, because she passed out on this plane, we're  not going to make it to Cleveland.  That's what I was thinking.  They're going to find the nearest airport. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, they're going to have to touch down somewhere else.  Like, son of a...  Inconvenience us.  Is there a man on the plane who can protect us in case someone attacks us?  Uh, no.  Geep, geep, geep, geep, geep.  Geep, geep, geep, geep, geep.  Is there a trained professional bodyguard on the plane?  Geep, geep, geep, geep, geep.  All right, listen.  Geep, geep, geep, geep, geep, geep.  It was an amazing flight.  But, you know, Patrice set it up perfectly because I never thought of it that way.  Yeah.  You're not getting the A crew. 
[00:31:00]  You're getting, like, the day strippers pretty much.  You're pretty lucky when those wheels hit the ground.  Yeah, go to your local strip club at, I don't know, one in the afternoon and see what's dancing  there.  Yeah.  Same crap is going on with the airline industry.  Oh, and just to finish the story, it's a quickie.  So then when everything kind of calms down, the stewardess who just put me in this complete  panic, like I've never panicked before in my life, goes, sorry, hon, I hope I didn't  scare you.  And I go, so I just went, I put both arms up. 
[00:31:30]  I go, don't even effing talk to me.  Didn't want to hear it.  Didn't want to look at her.  Hey, Warriors, sorry about that.  Yeah, sorry, babies.  Sorry, babies.  Hope you got back to Long Island.  Where was I getting back to calling you?  Sorry about that.  Sorry, babies.  That's what Opie got.  Yeah.  Go traveling.  Yeah.  Like she was Ethel, the waitress at the truck stop.  Yeah.  Sorry, honey, wrong pancakes.  I know you asked for blueberry, but I brought you walnuts.  You ain't allergic, are you?  I'm going to bring you the right ones right away.  I ain't even going to charge you more. 
[00:32:00]  Sorry, baby, your girlfriend's dead.  Sorry, Opie.  So obviously, we figured out after the fact, you know, Lindsay got up to go to the bathroom,  and this girl must have pretty much been right behind her, maybe going to the bathroom.  Obviously, she was going to the bathroom as well.  Lindsay goes in.  I guess the stewardess was turning around making coffee or something.  I don't know.  And then, boom, passed it out.  When the old switcheroo happened.  The old switcheroo.  And you're on a plane.  It's not like you're at a, I don't know, a concert or something.  Pretty easy to find.  Where there's a million different possibilities. 
[00:32:30]  There's not many possibilities when you're on a plane and all of a sudden you turn and there's an empty seat.  And especially if there's the occupied thing on the bathroom.  Perhaps the first thing you want to do is knock on that bathroom door, see who's in there, so as not to panic another passenger.  Or a piece like Fan is right now to get some break.  Oh, I know.  He's freaking.  Oh, excuse me, sir.  All right.  Excuse me, sir.  Have you seen our commercial break?  It was sitting right here next to you.  And apparently it's not here. 
[00:33:00]  It was supposed to be here about ten minutes ago.  Oh, my God.  Fan is starting to take my concentration away.  Hovering around because he can't say, hey, look, Opie, throw the break, sucker.  So he's floating around me.  I'm like, break, nigga.  Oh, he's freaking out.  Do they dump out of that?  No, who knows?  Al, don't dump out of that.  A black guy said it.  Black people are still allowed to say that word, Al.

[00:34:00]  Opie and Anthony!  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O and A virus slowly spreading across America.  Boozing across America.  Boozing across America like the blob.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to, well, it could be Daniel or Danielle from Pittsburgh. 
[00:34:30]  Who's this?  It's Dan.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  It's just Dan.  It's just Dan.  Yeah, you guys were talking about somebody getting sick on a plane there.  I was flying back from Vegas in 99, from Vegas to Indianapolis.  And the guy on the seat next to me died.  Just dropped that right there.  And then what do they do?  What do they do when that happens?  Well, there was three seats.  I was on the end.  This guy was sitting by the window.  So they made us all get out of the seat.  There was a nurse on the plane.  They pulled him down, and they gave him compressions and CPR in the middle of the aisle to take the back guy. 
[00:35:00]  So he died of a heart attack?  He died of a heart attack.  But, I mean, did you see him dying, or he just kind of just died?  Well, he was kind of having problems in the seat, and he was kind of shaking.  So the girl that was a nurse got up and started talking to him, and they took us all out of the seats.  And then she realized what was going on, and he basically collapsed there.  And the worst thing was, we were on a three-day banger in Vegas. 
[00:35:30]  I didn't sleep one minute.  There was no seats left on the plane.  And you're right.  In my head, I was thinking to myself, F this guy.  Yeah, at that point, you're like, I don't know the guy.  It sucks for his family.  It sucks for the people that know him.  But, man, I need to get a little shut-eye here.  People get very inconvenienced on planes.  So the guy's dead.  What happens now?  Well, the bad thing was, it took up a bunch of the aisles, like a lot of the aisles.  You really couldn't climb over him to get back to your seat, nor did I want to. 
[00:36:00]  So you had to stand for the rest of the flight?  Exactly.  Me and the other guy that were in the two seats had to sit there and stand for about another 40 minutes.  So, and where did they land the plane?  And we were landing in Indianapolis.  We were only 40 minutes away from, I guess, what I understand.  They didn't want to divert it because he was already dead.  Oh, man, I hope that's what happened.  If he's already dead, why divert the plane?  Why?  You know, the body's going to wait.  It's not going to help anything.  Yeah, so they threw a blanket over him, and I was making no attempts to climb over him. 
[00:36:30]  Were they still trying to, you know, give out refreshments?  Like what's protocol?  Because you don't want to panic.  I mean, the plane's already in a panic, obviously.  But, I mean, do you continue, like, giving out drinks?  Do you continue the movie?  Yeah.  Well, it was a red eye, just like your flight.  I can tell you I had a friend in the front of the plane who had no idea this was going on.  Yeah, man.  I mean, flying in the middle of the night is just creepy.  But, Anthony, I got to tell you something about Anthony.  He looks at flying like it's time travel. 
[00:37:00]  It's a time machine to me these days.  Used to be a very exciting thing.  I would just look out the window.  I'd have my computer.  I'd bring movies.  I'd do everything just to, like, you know, pass the time.  But you're still on there for four, five hours if you're going to L.A., something like that.  And now I'm just tired of it.  Had too much of it, especially lately.  So, quick Bloody Mary when the stewardess comes around at the beginning, when they're boarding. 
[00:37:30]  And then I lay my head down and I'm out the entire flight.  This time, I was out before they pushed back from the gate.  I was asleep.  With no medicine or nothing?  No, just asleep.  And then I woke up when I heard, you know, ladies and gentlemen, we're on our final approach.  Bring the seats to a full upright position.  And I wake up and I'm like, oh.  And to me, a second went by because I was asleep. 
[00:38:00]  So, I consider that my version of time travel.  Not only traveling through space, but time itself.  You are so lucky, man.  Every bump I feel.  You know, the story I just told, it was one of those rare occasions where I was completely out cold.  Who knows how long I was going to, you know, end up sleeping.  But to Anthony, it's, you know, this flight, what, was four hours?  Yeah.  To you, it was less than five minutes.  Yeah.  Less than five minutes.  It was however long we had to wait for the stopover in Cleveland.  You missed all the commotion. 
[00:38:30]  That was only happening, by the way, a couple of rows in front of you.  Yeah.  Well, didn't matter to me.  Good night.  Didn't matter to me.  Dan in Pittsburgh.  So, dead body in the aisle, 40 minutes before the plane lands.  So, what's going through everyone's head?  How did they get the dead body off the plane?  Did they get the body off first?  Yeah.  Who gets the lead?  What point in the flight was it?  Was it the beginning or the middle?  They said, he said there was only 40 minutes left.  Oh, okay.  A little towards Dan, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, but who gets the lead?  They took him out of the back.  They had a crew come up and took him out of the back.  Ah, they got the dead stairway.  I was dead on my feet.  I was dead as that guy.  72 hours in his sleep for myself.  It didn't feel too good.  Put him in overhead.  James Brown.  And don't forget, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Not for that guy.  Not him, no.  Right.  Hey, do they cover his face at least so you don't get to see, so you don't have to look  at his creepy dead face?  Yeah, they put those little blankets over him.  Yeah.  Oh, great.  I was thinking, you don't know where these blankets have been. 
[00:39:30]  Like, they don't destroy the blankets.  You get those little blankets that you cover.  They're about, like, a piece of loose leaf paper thick.  The little blue blanket.  And if God knows, it's new, but they just refold them.  Yeah, it's in some plastic bag that they just have some body sticking in and melting them  shut again.  You call it a blue blanket?  It's like blue tissue paper.  Yeah, it's tissue paper.  But now we know the one you pull over yourself to take a little nappy could have been placed  over a dead guy's head. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  So you don't have to stare at his dead, dumb face.  All right, Dan.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  Hello to Pittsburgh this morning.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Jersey.  Glenn?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, I was on a flight going down to Mexico once.  I'm in the middle of Mexico.  No place big.  But this guy who was Mexican goes crazy on the flight, decides to attack the flight attendant,  throws hot coffee on her.  So a bunch of us jump up and grab him, throw him in the bathroom, and we have to hold him  in the bathroom for the entire flight while he's trying to push his way out the bathroom 
[00:40:30]  door.  Obviously, this happened after 9-11.  No, this is before...  Really?  This is back in probably the late 90s.  Yeah, because the story ends with him being alive after 9-11.  Oh, yeah.  After 9-11, dead.  They would dunk this Mexican in the blue water or whatever that is.  They would have flushed him.  Try to flush him out of the plane.  They would have poisoned him.  They were always waiting there at the end of the flight, pulling out the back of the  plane.  Yeah.  It was pretty exciting.  We had to sit there, and he was trying to pound his way out the door, and there was 
[00:41:00]  two of us sitting there holding the door for like an hour and a half straight.  Now, did the airline give you a little bit of something, a little thank you, sir, here's  some free flights for your help?  Absolutely not.  Exactly.  Nothing.  All right, Glenn.  Thank you.  What airline was it?  I think it was Continental.  Good.  Just so you know.  You didn't give him a dime.  Oh, by the way, the stewardess...  Help me stop a Mexican, an outraged Mexican, and he gets nothing.  Yeah.  By the way, the stewardess that panicked the hell out of me, the story I told, yes,  it was Continental.  It was Continental.  Yeah.  And I had all my miles with Continental. 
[00:41:30]  God.  Yeah.  It was the C team.  Oh, the C team at Continental.  The C team at Continental stinks.  But they seem to be the best airline, though, right?  Well, that's what Jimmy Norton says, but I haven't heard anything.  I bought the Jimmy Norton hype about Continental.  Youngest fleet.  Now, if I'm holding a Mexican, and the thing is, you don't want to go, hey, look, I held  a Mexican in the bathroom.  Can you give me a little something?  You just expect him to go, sir, thank you so much.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He deserves something. 
[00:42:00]  I'm going to give him 100 miles.  Give him a few miles.  A free upgrade for like a year for possibly saving the flight from a Mexican.  You're getting nothing.  Jack.  They wanted us to sit down for landing.  We wouldn't sit down and let him out of the bathroom.  Oh, good.  Good for you.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You don't have to go.  Oh, sorry.  That was good.  Dennis in Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey, Dennis.  Hey, I thought that guy who died on the plane, that reminds me of Arnold throwing a blanket 
[00:42:30]  over that guy.  Don't wake my friend.  He's dead tired.  Oh, from Commando.  Yeah, yeah.  He's dead tired.  And he went into the wheel thing and jumped in a swamp and went to save his daughter.  Day nine.  Don't wake him.  Chaudy.  Wait a minute.  He did the thing I love in the movie.  He did the movie neck break.  Yep.  Which doesn't exist.  But he just goes, da-da-da-da-da.  Crack.  And then put the thing over in it.  I guess they were flying. 
[00:43:00]  They were flying to, like, Thailand to kill somebody.  Yeah.  And it was in 24 hours once he landed in Thailand.  He had to save his daughter in the time of the plane.  The guy with the bloody broken neck nose.  Yeah, that was the scene he actually worked his way to the landing gear and jumped out  of a plane.  Into a swamp.  Into a swamp.  But he was fine.  What about it?  He didn't even leave the state.  He did his thing, man.  The worst move in the movies as far as a plane goes. 
[00:43:30]  Who was it?  Harrison Ford opening up the back of that.  What the hell was the name of that movie?  Air Force One.  Air Force One.  Air Force One.  And then parachuting from 35,000 feet or whatever it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, no.  Actually, Indiana Jones, where they open up that raft.  Oh, yeah.  The raft scene.  And go down the side of the mountain.  Go down the side of the mountain.  Yeah, well.  They hit the ground, and they're okay because they're in a raft.  Good point.  That could be the worst scene.  So what happened then?  Is some guy choked on the plane?  Yeah, it was like two months ago. 
[00:44:00]  I had a glass of oxygen.  Oh, they are a bit big to swallow.  He choked on a plane.  They were serving breakfast.  There were some potato things.  But the worst thing was, I'm used to flying, and there was like hot girls being stewardesses.  They had these gay guys.  They're stewards.  Stop.  You mean to tell me that if a guy is a flight attendant, his sexuality may be in question?  Dude, I got you beat.  And stupid Anthony, and I don't mean to call you stupid Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  I'm sorry about that.  You slept through everything yesterday.  Did you see the flight attendant that we had from Cleveland to Newark?  Please say you did.  No.  Now.  I'm nobody.  I got to go because I got a quick.  This is a quick story.  It was just an amazing day yesterday.  I saw nothing.  So now, after all that commotion from the flight to Vegas to Cleveland, I'm dead tired.  And now I'm on a new plane.  It's now, I'm going to call it the B team because now it's early morning. 
[00:45:00]  So I think.  We land and it's daytime.  Yeah.  It's Cleveland.  And the crew's, I think, a little better from Cleveland to Newark than the crew we had from  Vegas to Cleveland.  Now I'm like falling asleep.  I'm like, all right, all is well with the world.  We'll be home soon.  Now my head's back up against the glass.  And you know how you were saying earlier that sometimes I wake you to ask you if you want  a snack?  Yeah.  So I'm kind of dozing off and this thing, this thing wakes me up and goes, would you 
[00:45:30]  like anything, anything to drink?  Would you like anything to drink?  I can't really do the in between guy, girl voice.  Yeah.  I look up.  It's a thing as a flight attendant.  Like a tranny?  It was like China from the WWE.  A thing.  A thing.  Could you tell?  Was it a guy or was it a masculine girl?  Would you like anything to drink?  What was it?  I saw.  It was bothering me, just that impression.  I know.  That's the best I could do.  You know the voice, though.  It's what I'm saying.  It's creepy. 
[00:46:00]  Do the voice.  You know.  No, I don't.  I really don't.  I'm doing the voice a little better.  I don't know if it's a tranny or a gay guy.  I looked right at the Adam's apple, massive Adam's apple.  Was it dressed as a woman flight attendant?  Yes.  Hair back, makeup, a little librarian glad to hide.  I didn't know.  I assumed because we were talking about guys.  That it was a guy that was really gay.  Would you like something to drink?  Yeah, it was a woman.  Because that's how they look now.  Dude.  Yeah.  What happened to the sexy stews? 
[00:46:30]  In my mind, I turned, saw the thing, and went, ah!  But I don't think I actually did that.  But in my mind, I did.  And I just went, I gulped and went, no, thank you.  You know what?  Somebody should be able to say to, like, as he's talking to you, somebody should be able  to look at him and go, you know, why are you forcing me to be mature about your awful  look?  Like, why is this airline forcing me to pretend that this thing doesn't exist, dude?  I gulped.  I mean, a hell of a way to be woken up the second time. 
[00:47:00]  And that big, painy hand over your diet Sprite cup.  Patrice.  Patrice.  Patrice.  That's exactly what I was doing for the rest of the flight.  I was watching her bring, like, drinks and stuff, and I'm just staring at this hand going,  of course it's a guy.  Look at that hand.  Her hands are so big, her thumb and her index finger are touching around your glass.  Across the top of the...  Why?  And it wants to be known as a woman, so it's growing the nails a little longer, and that  manly hair making it even bigger.  Would you like something to treat? 
[00:47:30]  I don't know what happened.  What happened to, like, I remember seeing the old pictures of the sexy stews with the  big beehive hairdo and their little round bag that they would carry onto there, and they're  banging the pilots, and looking all hot.  Now they protested to the point where they could be 70 years old, so keep their job.  Sissies and hard to look at mongrels.  And gay gentlemen.  Sissies and mongrels.  You're shocked to see, like, a hot stewardess these days. 
[00:48:00]  You go, wow, that girl's pretty.  And she's not hot.  She's just comparatively.  Compared to the other ones.  Right.  And the hottest ones, and no lie, the ones that they do not hire ugly ones of, black stewardesses.  Yeah.  They hire young, sexy, black stewardesses.  They don't take no guff, though, the black ones.  Oh, they're not friendly, but at least they're decent to look at.  And nobody with a butt.  It's a shame.  Nobody with a butt.  It's a shame on the fly.  Except the men.  Would you like something to treat?  Except for Bob with his tight pants.  Yeah, Bob with his butt. 
[00:48:30]  This is getting a workout.  And his efficient picking up dinner after his done regimen.  Listen, we're going to continue.  We've got a lady that died on a flight.  Mike from the Bronx, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Coming up this weekend on the Saturday Night Virus, we're handing over the channel to the Holes.  Saturday from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., it's Dee Dee. 
[00:49:00]  And from 11 p.m. to midnight, it's Storytime with Francine.  Only on XM 202.  Hi, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to John in Long Island.  John.  Hey there, John.  What's up, John?  I'm trying to use John to set up Patrice's club dates, but John doesn't want to play. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, buddy.  All right, what do you want?  What happened?  What happened?  It's not John from Long Island.  Yeah, we know.  What's your name?  From Ozone Park.  What?  John from Ozone Park.  Oh, so it's not John from Long Island.  It's John from Ozone Park.  And you figured, even though I was talking to you on the phone and I got the name right,  I got the wrong place, so you decided it could not possibly be you.  Were you listening into your phone, sir? 
[00:50:00]  Well, you know what happened, man?  I'm online at 7-11.  I'm trying to get some coffee before I get back on my bus and go to work.  Oh, okay.  Are you listening on Free FM?  Uh, yes.  All right.  John from Ozone Park.  What's up?  How you doing, guys?  Great to talk to you.  He starts his call.  The opening shtick.  He goes into his part on the Ozone Park.  Right.  Enthusiastic listener.  John, we're already on the air, you guys.  Just speak like a human being, not like a radio caller. 
[00:50:30]  All right, John, what's up?  Patrice, I seen you a couple weeks ago on Caroline's, man.  You were great.  This is the guy that you thought was Dom from The Wire.  Oh, yeah, okay.  What's happening, man?  Yeah, I remember.  This kid looks just like Dominic.  What's Dom's name from The Wire?  You don't watch.  These guys.  If I start talking The Wire and stuff, it's shut down.  Nah, I got to watch that.  It's a good show with black folks on it, but one of the characters is a white guy named  Dominic. 
[00:51:00]  God, what's Dominic's last name?  Who gives a crap?  No.  I remember.  Thank you, sir.  I remember you very well, man.  I want to take everyone inside the radio show for a second here.  John from Ozone Park was supposed to be on the air for maybe 10 seconds.  Just as a setup.  It was supposed to be a setup where two and a half minutes into this phone call.  But he did what he had to do.  Oh, my God.  He got a job from Ozone Park.  He's the man.  He knows how to sell.  John, all I wanted from you, I like taking people inside the show. 
[00:51:30]  It says, Patrice is hilarious.  Where can I see him?  That's all we wanted from you.  That's all we wanted from you today as you're on 7-Eleven getting your coffee.  And then I was going to go, well, speaking of which, Patrice O'Neal, who's filling in  for Jim Norton, will be at Ohio State on January 18th.  Ohio State, the Ohio State University that lost to listening.  All right.  That's January 18th.  And then for everyone listening to us in Providence.  Providence, Rhode Island.  Catch a rising star in Providence, Rhode Island.  Yeah, January 26th and 27th. 
[00:52:00]  Yes, sir.  That's all we wanted from John.  But we just went on, and he wouldn't shut up.  He's a good guy, though.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in the Bronx.  We're going to try to move on here, but he's got a pretty good story as well.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Okay.  Yeah, I was taking the Aer Lingus flight over to Ireland a couple years ago.  Hey.  It's about a six-hour flight, and we're sitting there having some cocktails, having a good  time.  And you hear some screams and some yelling a couple rows back.  You turn to see what's going on.  You see everybody crowding around from family, and some woman's really shrieking. 
[00:52:30]  So we look, and they make the announcement if there's a doctor on board, all that stuff,  and you see some guy go running back with an oxygen tank.  So whatever.  I go back to my cocktails, and a couple minutes later, they make another announcement, more  urgent.  Please, we need somebody, anybody, a nurse, whatever.  And you turn around, and they're doing compressions on this old lady who's there with her.  It must be her son or her daughter and his wife or husband, whatever.  And you know they're going back to the homeland.  Oh, man, they've been planning this trip for a decade. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, yeah, they're going back to see the old rock house she grew up in 300 years ago.  But it didn't work out for Granny, because they're working on her, working on her.  They clear out the section, but you can still see.  And you just see tears coming down the face of the daughter.  And they put the blanket over her, and they drag old Granny to the back of the plane.  And the next five hours, you sit there wondering, wow, there's a dead old lady about 30 feet  behind me.  Yeah, pop the Heinekens, let's go.  Yeah, because you don't care.  You don't know them.  No, I paid a couple grand for this trip. 
[00:53:30]  I don't care.  Dead or alive, we're going all the way.  So, you know, we landed, and I guess they carted her off after we bolted.  But that was it.  Yeah, people become very self-centered.  I never thought we'd get a few stories of dead people on a plane today.  Yeah, it probably happens a lot.  Screw snakes on a plane.  There's dead people on the plane.  Snakes on a plane.  Story about Scorpion.  Scorpion's on a plane recently.  A guy was on a flight, and apparently the plane had come from Texas.  He didn't get on in Texas, got on somewhere else.  But the Scorpion had gotten on in Texas. 
[00:54:00]  And he's sitting in his seat.  Apparently the Scorpion crawled up his left leg, stung him in his calf, and then continued up his leg.  And then he kind of feels like this numbness in his leg and looks and sees he's been bitten by something.  But he doesn't really do anything about it.  So he's down then by the baggage carousel after the flight's landed.  And the Scorpion hits him again on his right leg and comes out his pan cuff of his right leg. 
[00:54:30]  So apparently it made the round trip through his groin area and everything and fell out the bottom.  Somebody by the carousel stepped on it, and they took him to the hospital.  And it seems that if you're healthy, a Scorpion bite won't kill you.  It'll just give you like a tealy, numbing kind of...  You watch all these shows.  There's some sissy Scorpions that just have sharp teeth. 
[00:55:00]  And then there's some kick-ass ones.  Yeah, there's some...  Like the big ones, they do nothing.  I think if you're in Africa, you get killed like in a second from a Scorpion.  Well, you can get killed by an ant in Africa.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Everything's deadly in Africa.  You get a paper cut on a blade of grass, and you got like 30 minutes to get to a hospital.  Oh, I believe in my name, my leader.  Tee-tee flies.  You can get killed by flies.  Tee-tee flies.  Tee-tee flies.  Flies are gangsta in Africa.  A fly can kill you. 
[00:55:30]  Tee-tee flies and those little baby Scorpions.  You can get really...  I mean, we got things like rattlesnakes and...  Yeah.  Black widows, I think.  We got only like two or three things.  Yeah.  We got rattlesnakes.  They're pretty deadly.  Even though some people are bit by rattlesnakes, they live too.  Yeah, you suck the poison out of them.  I'm certain that somewhere in Africa, there's dinosaurs.  There's just people, they just...  They look at them and...  Dinosaurs that we just don't know, though. 
[00:56:00]  Everything.  They sit cross-legged and smoke cigars.  Yeah.  Have ascots, like...  Just sit there.  Talk about the good old days when it was stegosauruses.  They're still all primitive with their Nike shirts on.  And plaid shorts.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, yeah, we just airdropped lousy clothing over there.  It's a shame.  They're still using a stick to get their dinner, but they got the smoosh on there.  He's shooting at a monkey in a tree with a blowgun.  Booboo! 
[00:56:30]  Booboo!  Booboo!  Booboo!  Booboo!  But they got, like, a Chicago Bulls jersey on.  AK-47, no shoes, and a top hat.  That is so right.  You're taking me out of the game here.  If you're doing these shows, you might want to take off the Nike wear.  Yeah.  It really does ruin it, because I remember as a kid watching shows on National Geographic,  and you'd see these, the Bushmen of the Kalahari, and they were pretty much wearing a piece of bark from a tree covering their most vital. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  And that was it.  You know, they'd be walking around with the blowgun, killing monkeys, and then they would tie the tail of the monkey around the head and carry it back like a purse.  And that was pretty much it.  And they'd feed the village.  They're just eating raw monkey meat in this little tent, talking to each other.  And now you watch these shows, and you see the African people, and, yeah, they're wearing, like, it's like we dropped one of those big deposit clothes for the homeless bins in the middle of Africa, and they just went through it. 
[00:57:30]  They're doing horrible stuff.  They're doing some kind of rain dance, and they're wearing the Portland Trailblazers.  Yeah, it takes you right out of that hole.  Workout jersey.  Reebok pumps in a brass skirt.  It takes you right out of it. 
[00:58:00]  Come on.  Get the natives back to being naked.  That's what I say.  Get them nude.  Naked from the bottom down.  I want to see them nude.  And an Allen Iverson Nuggets jersey.  Right.  An Allen Iverson different Nuggets jersey.  You can't completely make it on the bottom.  You got better sneakers than I do.  What the hell's going on here?  Oh, my God.  Anyway.  Hey, changing gears slightly.  Anthony found something great on the Internet. 
[00:58:30]  We love the Internet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This one, I guess it's making the rounds.  I guess it's up on YouTube?  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, many stories coming out of Vegas.  Monday night, they put together a club night for us, for Anthony and I, at Jet.  Very, very, very, very popular nightclub out there in Vegas.  Apparently it is.  Extremely popular.  Lines outside the place for people trying to get in. 
[00:59:00]  $100 a head just to get into this joint.  Boof, boof, boof, boof, boof.  Just loud music.  XM decided to spend, I don't know, $20,000 on this club night.  For what reason, I still don't know.  Yep.  Just a waste of money.  Ant and I were talking about how corporate people just waste money.  And then you try to get a raise.  You work for this company for, and I'm not talking about myself.  I'm talking about companies in general.  You work your balls off.  You're trying to get a lousy $5 raise from your boss.  They can't afford it.  They tell you all the reasons why they can't give you a raise. 
[00:59:30]  And then Ant and I are lucky enough to be part of this corporate world.  And we watch the spending and how ridiculous it is.  It's slap-on-the-back parties that they hold in various corners of this globe.  That's pretty much what it is.  Let's all get on a plane, fly somewhere posh, and pat each other on the back.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know CBS Radio.  We went down to the manager's meeting down there in West Palm Beach.  Yep.  You know, they're flying managers in from all over the country. 
[01:00:00]  They're putting them up in the Ritz-Carlton, where rooms are as big as a gymnasium.  There's a palace.  And they're playing golf all day, and they're having dinners and entertainment.  And then, you know, and then you read in the corporate pamphlet how they had to, like, let 250 employees go.  And, well, we don't know where this money's gone.  We just don't have the money to keep these people employed.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  Where's my golf clubs?  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah 
[01:00:30]  Me and my chick are in the middle of this place, and, like, the music's just pounding, thumping. 
[01:01:00]  We've already shaken hands with everybody.  You can't have a conversation in those clubs.  You can't have a conversation.  It's not going to happen.  Well, let's preface this, though.  We have to preface this with that you're 59 years old.  I am 64 years old.  We have to preface that.  Don't ever forget.  But, dude, they went old school in the VIP room.  You don't want to be the old guy in the club.  This was one of these things where, yeah, let me tell you, seeing the line going in, it's all, like, chicks dressed in crepe paper. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  You know, they got nothing on.  Beautiful.  Bunch of young Guido guys with their hair all slicked back and young black guys, and they all just want to get in there and make their moves on chicks and stuff like that.  I'm in there with my girlfriend.  I don't want to be there.  I don't want to be there.  Boof, boof, boof.  Can't talk over that. 
[01:02:00]  So me and my girl just kind of grab each other and start doing this retarded little dance toward the door to the music.  Looking around, trying to see if, like, any executives are looking, and slipped right out the door.  I was, oh, I was playing poker in a matter of minutes.  I was just out of there.  Yeah, I'm talking to some of the bigwigs from XM, and it was bottle service, you know, because not only were we in the VIP room, they're giving us some of the seats.  You know, just to sit down in one of these VIP rooms, you guys spend a minimum of $600 on a bottle of vodka. 
[01:02:30]  And they're sitting around pouring the bottle of vodka around the table, talking about how bad of a year XM had.  I'm like, yeah, it really sucks.  Hey, another $600 bottle of vodka over here, please.  Who thought that one up?  Bottle clubs.  Where you go in and you've got to buy bottles, and they cost like $600 each for a bottle of vodka.  And that's just for the bottle, then you've got to tip the waitresses, and the staff, and this and that. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, everything else goes along with it that would go along with any club night, but you're paying $600 for a bottle.  Oh, they just waste money.  But then, you know, one of our guys will need a raise or something and be like, oh, well, I don't know.  Did you see the budget?  Let me show you this graph.  Corporate garbage.  It really is garbage.  So, oh, so really fast.  It's just a quick, dumb thing.  The YouTube guys were there. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Because it was CES, Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, and somehow the YouTube guys were invited to this XM VIP party at Jet.  Mm-hmm.  The owners that just sold the company to Google.  Yeah.  For $2 billion.  They sold YouTube to Google for $2 billion.  Two guys.  Huh?  Was it more than $2 billion?  I think it was $16 billion.  $2 billion.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Stop.  I really think I read something. 
[01:04:00]  Stop.  I don't think it was $16 billion.  I heard $2 billion.  And it was split.  Okay.  It was split between two guys.  So, according to Elo from XM, he figured that these guys, after all was said and done, walked away with between $800 and $900 million each.  Really?  YouTube is, the work is done by, not you.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing.  They just got to make sure the server stays up.  Yeah.  That's pretty much it, because everyone else contributes. 
[01:04:30]  It's not like you got to contribute as the owner any material.  The people do it.  You just got to make sure the hardware works.  So, you hire a tech guy or two to keep the computer running, and the money just rolls in.  The original tech guy made a couple of dollars, $16.82 an hour.  Yeah.  And you make a billion dollars, and what are they, 12 years old?  Because only 12-year-olds make up this year.  They don't even look like they're 30. 
[01:05:00]  And each guy got about $800 to $900 million, and they were hanging in the VIP room at Jet.  And we were hanging with them most of the night.  Really cool guys.  Chad, and I forgot the other guy's name, the Asian gentleman.  $1.65 billion.  $1.65?  $1.65 billion.  They sold it for.  That's your question.  So, that's what I got the 16 from.  Sorry.  I know nothing about it.  So, say I have a company like this.  Uh-huh.  At what point do you know, this is a good deal, $1.6 billion. 
[01:05:30]  Like, I'll be like, hey, man, we want to buy YouTube from you, Patrice, for $30,000.  Sold.  Okay, just sold.  At what point do you know it's worth $1.6 billion?  You know what it is?  When everyone's talking about it, when it's got a buzz, when it's on the news, when people  are showing it on late night talk shows, they're showing clips from it.  Then you go, wow, I could sell this for a billion dollars. 
[01:06:00]  It's not.  It's not.  That's, you know what, that's the Dr. Evil way of doing it.  Yeah.  You just take a guess.  But how do you-  I could sell for a billion dollars.  How does Google know to off which?  Which means that Google did rip them off if that's what they bought it for.  Oh, yeah.  Because Google is versed in this game better than YouTube.  They probably lowballed them.  They lowballed them for $1.6 billion.  Yeah.  Probably.  You mean we could have made $5 billion?  Yep.  God.  I knew I was a dummy.  Completely ripped them off.  I was an ass. 
[01:06:30]  I was one of the first people in my high school into computers.  I said, ah, what is- nothing's going to come of this.  Where's this going?  Where's this going?  I blew it off and went, I'd rather be in communications.  It's just, and it's amazing because the beginning, it was nothing but sex made money on the internet.  Yeah.  Nothing but sex.  And now, all these other, you know, video sites and interactive sites where there's no sex on YouTube.  There's no sex on there. 
[01:07:00]  So-  No.  There's sex on YouTube?  Not really.  Not very, very-  No.  YouTube is very, very, very soft core.  Barely.  Yeah.  You get, like, chicks dancing around in a bikini crap.  If you tab up some stuff, it'll say, these videos are a little funky.  Yeah.  Those are the ones that show people being killed.  Death is fine.  Don't show us any boobies.  Death is fine on YouTube, but boobies got-  No boobies.  But the guys, they ended up really cool.  The original owners of YouTube, they got to hang around for 18 months and then they're 
[01:07:30]  finally-  We'll move on.  They can take their money and run.  Yeah.  But, so, I'm here in 1.65 billion, okay?  So, do the math.  About $800 million each is what these guys took away from me.  And I'm hanging with both the guys and one of the-  The Asian guy asked for a bottle of water and a waitress comes up at Jed and gives him  a bottle of water and goes, that'll be 10 bucks.  The guy turns to me and goes, can you believe it's $10 for water?  Which is pretty outrageous.  But when you just made $800 million. 
[01:08:00]  I'm sitting there going, ass, you're a billionaire.  You're a billionaire.  You should have robbed him.  You could method it.  Right.  I'm thinking, I want to say so bad, you could buy this casino that we're in right now with  your money.  I should have.  You little jerk.  He's bitching because it's a bottle of water for $10.  Everyone says that.  I guess it's the principle.  Yeah.  I guess.  I'm talking about it for the little guy.  If I'm worth a billion, I've been worth a few hundred. 
[01:08:30]  I've been a high hundred there.  And if that'll be $20, I'll be like, hey, man, here's a 30.  Here's 30.  Right.  Now give me my stick of bubble gum.  Over tipping.  So I watched him give the $10, no tip.  I'm like, oh my God, dude, you're a billionaire.  What are you doing?  He hasn't gotten that down yet.  What happened so fast, he doesn't have it down yet.  Most of these waitresses, you give them a little extra, they're going home with you.  Like, he's the nerdiest dude to begin with.  I'm like, not only you should just give $20 and give your car and say, here, I'm the original owner of YouTube. 
[01:09:00]  I'm worth a billion dollars.  Not even $20, $50.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Right.  You have finagled this thing you did.  You should be throwing hundreds in the air as you walk out of the place, leaving your mark.  It's things like, you know, because there are thousands of sites that are exactly like YouTube.  Thousands of sites that were like MySpace.  Things like that.  But for some reason, one of these gets that buzz about it and that becomes the billion dollar site. 
[01:09:30]  And then the other ones, some poor guy is sitting there just trying to figure out how to pay his bandwidth charges every month.  There's no rhyme or reason to it.  It's the same thing.  It's people uploading video.  Does it make it any easier on YouTube than it does on any other site?  I don't think so.  It got to be the ease of it too.  Because, you know, YouTube is a good site because you go on and you type up, I want to see such and such. 
[01:10:00]  And then they give you all the stuff that's in the category.  I mean, it's really an easy site.  99% of it is crap.  Just crap.  It's just a billion dollar crap hole.  Crap.  A billion dollars worth of crap.  Of just videos of teenage girls whining about something.  Old men yelling about something.  Occasionally you'll get something cool like, you know, the David Caruso.  Yeah, that's what we're going to have to play next. 
[01:10:30]  We'll play a little of that.  This is where we were leading, but now we have to kind of step aside.  But Anthony found a David Caruso thing that's up on YouTube.  That's hilarious.  And we'll get into that next.  How's that?  How's that?  Good.  All right.  We'll step aside.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-3.  O'Neill, who's this?  Hi.  I'm Tony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So why'd you call?  The man on the radio said I could call.

Patrice O'Neill in studio.  1-866-313-FREE.  Let's say hi to Sterling in Maine.  Sterling, what's up?  How are you? 
[01:12:00]  All right.  This is Colin.  I listened the first time the other day with the deaf interpreter.  I've been listening ever since, spreading the buzz around here.  We listen.  I'm a lobster man on a lobster boat.  We listen there.  And go ahead.  What station you listen on?  93.9.  Very good.  Well, there you go.  Someone's listening to us.  That's right.  I mean...  That's refreshing.  We got another road laughing my butt off.  It was hilarious.  Thank you, sir.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  So we're on the water, lobstering.  So you guys are listening on land and on sea, so... 
[01:12:30]  Catching lobsters.  Isn't that great?  And they could just...  The second they go through a restaurant door, they become so expensive.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not that bad.  They're like seven bucks a pound.  This is not like the deadliest catch, man.  I mean...  No.  It's a little safer to catch lobsters.  You got to be honest here.  You're not sitting there in the icy waters.  No, that's just true.  It does get cold up here, though.  It's just a bunch of...  A little nippy.  Just a bunch of New England drunks making a living. 
[01:13:00]  Do they let you take them home or they...  They're the world champion patriots, though.  Yeah.  The world champion.  How many do you get to take home?  Yeah, or they treat you like African diamonds.  I take a few home a day.  Three or four.  They let you or you got to sneak them?  I don't know.  Yeah, like the African blood diamonds, the blood lobster.  Catch like four or five hundred pounds a day.  Kill your farm.  Yeah.  You know what I used to do when I was working for a living, doing air conditioning?  I didn't have enough money a lot of times to even eat with.  It was like that bad.  But I had my company vehicle and they gave me a company credit card. 
[01:13:30]  It was a Texaco card.  So, I knew a Texaco station where the guy was a lobster fisherman and he would sell them  right there at the gas station.  So, I'd pull in, get half a tank of gas and then buy about four lobsters.  And half a tank of lobster.  And tell the guy, could you just ring this up as gas?  And he would.  So, I'd be able to hand him my receipt.  And meanwhile, I only paid for half the gas and got to eat.  Oh, wow.  Black person do that desoluting. 
[01:14:00]  White person does it as feeding his family lobster.  Dirty.  Dirty.  Stinking lobster feet.  All those Negroes stealing televisions, but a white man does it.  I know it.  It's entrepreneurship.  Jerry, jeek.  Let's just touch the claws.  That's all they want.  If I told that story, fire him.  Get him out of there.  Get him out of there.  Get him out of there, fireman.  I'll have him arrested.  I want him all brought up on charges.  He's a savage.  Get him out of there.  Grand theft crustacean. 
[01:14:30]  It's got to be a law.  Endangering species.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  Thank you, lobster man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's go to Scott in Massachusetts.  Scott, what's up?  What's up, dude?  What?  What's up, guys?  What's up, Scott?  Nothing much, man.  Just been listening to your show all morning.  Love the stuff.  Oh, thanks.  Thank you.  Now, how do you listen to the radio show?  I come to school every day.  I'm only, like, what, 16 now, so...  Well, do you listen on regular radio? 
[01:15:00]  Do you listen to the satellite?  Regular radio.  Everything else is too much money.  All right.  I pay for, you know, frequencies.  All right.  I'm not really getting an answer here.  I don't know.  16.  Oh, these darn kids.  He loves the show.  He says he's watching to us on Pal Talk.  Oh, hi.  By the way.  So, getting to what Anthony found on the internet overnight there, Dave Caruso.  David Caruso from CSI.  You want to explain this?  It's called David Caruso One-Liners.  It's from CSI, you know. 
[01:15:30]  It's one of those popular shows on television.  It's just amazing how popular these CSI shows are that they decided to just make CSI Miami, right?  And then there's CSI New York, Gary Sinise.  And then the original one with David Caruso.  It's so popular, they're working on CSI Patterson.  CSI Patterson.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Yeah, they're working on CSI Patterson.  A little known fact. 
[01:16:00]  Is that right, Doc?  I used to write for Johnny Carson.  No.  It's a very popular joke.  I'm sure that joke's in the comedy clubs.  Oh, my God.  Very popular.  David Caruso, the star.  And he is such a horrific actor that somebody had sensed it up.  I thought he would be loved.  I thought he was this beloved, edgy guy.  When he was on NYPD Blue and then he left, people were like, oh, my God, the show's going to suck now. 
[01:16:30]  He's an idiot for leaving.  And then he just was in limbo for a while, made a few bad movies.  And then he got this CSI lottery he hit.  And everyone watches it, loves it.  And he is the worst actor ever, ever, ever.  Horrid.  And somebody had sense enough to take a bunch of clips of him delivering these lines, these Caruso one-liners.  And before each line, or in the middle of each line, he will stop and dramatically put on his sunglasses. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, this is what you're going to miss, unfortunately.  It's visual, but go to YouTube and just put in David Caruso.  David Caruso, one-liner.  Or just David Caruso, and it'll pop up.  It'll pop up.  All right.  And he'll put his sunglasses on and deliver this cornball line in the best William Shatner-type delivery I've seen since Shatner.  And the writing is so hokey that the line being delivered is just awful. 
[01:17:30]  And the way he delivers it is awful.  And then he puts his glasses on and does some kind of an exit, stage left even.  And he's gone.  He just delivers a hack line with the sunglasses and then exits stage right even.  And he's gone out of the scene.  We know he's CSI Miami.  Thank you, Pat.  CSI Miami?  Is that where he is?  But it's the one-liner montage.  Montage. 
[01:18:00]  Thank you, Eric.  You got one job, and you blew it.  All we wanted was a montage.  Can't pay attention to the montage line.  All right.  Well, here we go.  We got a little audio of this David Caruso video that's going to be really, really hot in the next few days on YouTube.  Basically, we've got a drive-by.  Drive-by Miami style.  I don't think so.  If you don't spend $1,000 on clothes that you're never going to wear. 
[01:18:30]  A hundred people throwing golf balls at the sight of a death.  Those odds are very slim, aren't they?  So the question becomes, Alex, was the mob sent to draw us to the crime scene?  We're sent to destroy it.  Yeah.  These are actual lines.  Yeah, these are actual lines.  Actual lines from the show.  And his delivery?  Amazingly awful.  Every time he says something, he has a dramatic pause. 
[01:19:00]  And that pause, by the way, is when he is putting on his sunglasses.  Who tells him this is good?  Hey, man.  The ratings speak volumes.  Damn show is huge.  Jimmy on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Jimmy, how do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  I listen on the radio.  I listen on XM.  I listen to both of them.  All over the place.  All right.  So what do you got to add to this discussion?  Well, we watch this show religiously. 
[01:19:30]  And every time I see this guy, I know exactly, exactly when he's going to go to a commercial break.  It's like he stands off to the side.  Every time he does something, he's always at an angle.  He never looks at you directly.  You ever see him stand at that angle and look over his shoulder?  Yeah.  Yeah, he stands out.  Yeah, there's a dramatic angle going on.  Yeah, the stance.  I throw things at the TV, man.  My wife laughs at me.  I want to throw stuff at the TV at this guy. 
[01:20:00]  I want to kill him.  And how about right after he delivers his line, he walks out of frame?  That's it.  He's out of there.  Like, he'll walk or run sometimes.  He'll deliver the dramatic line, and he's out of frame.  Like, I've said my line.  Thank you.  Good night.  What about this one?  What about this one?  You got Delgo, the Spanish guy.  He kneels down in front of a dead body, and then Horatio Cain looks off into the sunset  and goes, what do we got, Delgo?  He doesn't even look at it.  He doesn't look at it.  He looks away. 
[01:20:30]  Just looking up into space.  What do we got?  He's a moron.  He's a horrible actor.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Let's get back to the David Caruso montage.  We only had one week before deliberations.  No need now.  The verdict is in.  What is that?  This is fake.  No need now.  The verdict is in.  This is all actual lines from CSI Miami.  Real lines delivered.  This is exactly how he delivers the lines.  I know y'all are taking this out.  It has to be because, like, whatever he just said, it has to be a continued sentence. 
[01:21:00]  No.  No.  You've got to edit it out.  Let me tell you something.  You have to watch it.  When I seen him, I think I saw him.  But you cut out the butt.  No.  Hey, listen to this, though.  I mean, how can we cut something out when he's running off frame?  Right.  He's exiting stage left.  He's exiting.  Stage right, Ethan.  And someone else is pointing out that he always has his hands on his hips.  Yeah.  Hands on his hips.  He's got to take his sunglasses off, put them back on, take them off.  Let's continue with the montage. 
[01:21:30]  Thanks, E-Rock.  Sorry.  I didn't get a montage from you.  Montage.  Oh, God, forget about it.  In five minutes, they call it speed day.  Only their victim had 15 days.  Well, you know what they say, Frank.  Speed kills.  You don't fall three stories.  Get up and run away.  You do.  You've got something to hide.  You should be a poker, Frank. 
[01:22:00]  Where is Patrick now?  Well, I don't know.  He's missing from the scene.  Maybe he took off.  Or maybe he got taken for a ride.  What is he, Rod Serling?  Or maybe.  You know what they say.  You know there's guys around him going, holy crap.  You know how much they pay this guy?  Or maybe.  Maybe it's a different feel.  I got to watch it.  I'm a horrible actor.  This can't be that bad.  This is the real deal.  Play Gary Sinise. 
[01:22:30]  Play some clips from Gary Sinise's version.  See if he's doing the same thing.  Yeah, maybe Gary Sinise is like, watch out, sucker.  It's like it's worked well for him, for Caruso.  Maybe I need to do this.  You want more or what?  I got to listen to more of this.  Opie, please, play some more clips.  What?  Because if this is such a high-rated show, perhaps we can do the same thing. 
[01:23:00]  Patrice, say something dramatic, will you?  Hey, let me tell you something, baby.  Working here, it's a pleasure.  I got one.  Would you like something to drink?  That was awful.  I'm not thirsty.  I'm thirsty.  I'm thirsty.  I got one. 
[01:23:30]  Was your girlfriend sitting right here?  Well, either she got off the plane,  or the plane got away from being around her.  Awful, dumb lines.  Let's go to Dan on Long Island.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  We're asking that question today.  I'm sorry.  I'm so glad to hear you guys rip around the sky. 
[01:24:00]  I sit in front of the TV and laugh my ass off.  Or you talk about what you want.  Or maybe my pants are too high.  What are you saying there, Dan?  The guy's pants are so high, he's never looking out on the camera.  He's ridiculous.  He's like the worst actor.  I even hated him in NYPD Blue.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying,  because I didn't watch NYPD Blue when he was on,  but a lot of people are saying he had the same acting style. 
[01:24:30]  Not many people change, I guess.  He's just hope to pop his ass.  He's like, he's ridiculous.  He thinks he's delivering these profound,  like, dramatic lines that people are just going like,  this guy, where does he keep the Emmys?  Where does he keep them?  And it's just horrible acting.  Punching out.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Punching out.  Punching out.  Or are we punching in? 
[01:25:00]  If I wasn't diabetic, I'd take a bite out of this big apple.  You want more or what?  This is amazing to me.  All right, here we go.  David Caruso.  How do things look over there?  Either he's dead.  Or he's not alive.  I'm sorry.  I see I did such a long delay.  He's not living.  Oh, my God. 
[01:25:30]  Wait, you can see how long you can pause for.  I was stepped on by a colored guy.  Hey, here's X-Man.  What's up, boys?  Where are you calling from, X-Man?  New Jersey.  How do you listen to the Opie and Anthony show?  I catch free FM in the morning and the X-Men at night on the way home.  All right.  Trying to figure how people are listening to this show.  All right.  So what do you got there?  This guy's like the wannabe Dirty Harry, like in search of a one-liner. 
[01:26:00]  Ah, true.  Wannabe Dirty Harry.  There you go.  Yeah.  He's hoping for that catchphrase that's going to just catch on with all of America.  I think he's been killed, or perhaps murdered.  All right.  Let's go back to David Caruso, CSI.  Give us some.  One-liner montage.  Prince said she came down to drink mojitas and ketchup sun.  Well, it looks like something caught her. 
[01:26:30]  What?  This is, this is, this is, without a doubt.  No.  No, without a doubt, this is Doctored Up, dude.  This is Doctored Up.  Go to YouTube, put in David Caruso or David Caruso One-Liner, and you will see, I can't  get it with the thing.  Yeah, Iraq will put it up there so you can kind of look without the sound, but you'll see  his, the glasses, the pompous attitude. 
[01:27:00]  The camera moving.  The camera moving angle.  The camera moving around him.  Him looking over his shoulder.  Just a drama queen, this guy.  Yeah.  Oh, just watch one CSI Miami.  You'll see it for yourself.  Oh, yeah.  There'll be 20 of these scenes.  He just loves, look at the glasses off.  The glasses come on.  It's a dramatic moment.  Could you play the last one you played for this?  Yeah.  That last one.  There's no way.  Here it is again.  Prince Fitz, you came down to drink mojitas and catch some sun. 
[01:27:30]  But it looks like something caught her.  Something caught her.  That's just so bad that I don't believe this.  It's like he wrote his lines on his hand and he's reading them.  Looks like someone kagu-hats her.  How is that pronounced?  But the style is, all you got to do is just go right with the person.  Like, ask me a question.  I just, Patrice, it's a great jacket. 
[01:28:00]  Where'd you pick that up?  Where I poke you.  Wait, no.  What?  No, it's not a question.  Take two.  Take two.  You got to make a statement.  A statement?  And then I make another statement.  All right.  Let me try that.  It's like, boy, this studio sure has been a place where a lot has happened.  Looks like this place has been a place where a lot has happened.  He just reiterates. 
[01:28:30]  He just reiterates with something clever.  Wait a minute.  If you listen to it, it's just the person makes a garbled statement and then he just.  Anything as innocent as being at the supermarket.  That'll be $49.95.  I bet that's about $49.95.  No, wait, wait.  Make the statement.  Here it is.  Go ahead.  This is because they set him up for like to make some classic statement like speed kills 
[01:29:00]  is a statement.  Right.  But make that statement again, $49.95.  Sure.  That'll be $49.95.  Yeah, that's about five cents from 50.  Yeah.  It's all profound.  But they set him up.  This is why you can't really ad-lib it because we're doing it wrong.  It's like speed kills is a statement.  It's like, okay, ready? 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Look.  Okay.  Say the lady has a yellow.  I'm going to set you up.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, geez, man.  Looks like she has one of those little yellow smiley faces on her shirt.  Doesn't look like she'll be smiling anymore.  No.  Ask me the question.  All right.  All right.  That lady's got a little yellow smiley face on.  Yeah.  But it doesn't look like she'll be having a nice day. 
[01:30:00]  Okay.  All right.  I see.  Let's go back to the actual, let's go back to the actual David Caruso CSI one-liner montage.  All right.  You died hours before this accident ever happened.  So our accident is not an accident at all.  It's not his fault. 
[01:30:30]  I refuse to make this David Caruso's fault.  Come on.  It's the writing's fault.  The writing is horrific.  It's the writing.  It's horrific.  He has nothing to work with.  But he's delivering them like, wait a minute.  Okay.  Try to deliver that without being hexed.  How do you deliver speed kills in Denzel Starr?  You can't.  What was the last line?  I got to hear that one.  I'm sorry.  What was the last one?  An accident wasn't an accident at all.  Yeah.  Maybe the accident wasn't an accident at all. 
[01:31:00]  Is that how he delivered it?  Pretty much.  Not deliver that.  But deliver it like any other actor might.  I'm not an actor, but it seems like you wouldn't put so many pauses in Denzel Starr.  He's over-the-top dramatic.  Yeah.  The writing is bad, but then he adds to it with the over-the-top dramatic.  Scotty, it seems like this accident wasn't an accident at all.  Scotty, beam me up.  Scotty, speed kills, Spock. 
[01:31:30]  Speed kills.  He's horrible.  Oh, is he the worst?  Look.  Can we get back to this?  Wait a minute.  Do something from Jaws.  A couple of lines from Jaws.  I think.  Well, here's to swimming with bow-legged women.  Someone's suggesting, uh, well, this was not a boating accident. 
[01:32:00]  Someone's suggesting Steve's famous lines, Anthony.  Oh, no.  How did your parents die?  That's one for the hardcore listeners. 
[01:32:30]  Steve's awful acting.  This is amazing, man.  Well, it looks like we're going to need a bigger boat.  Let's get, uh, want some more or what?  Actual David Caruso CSI one-liner.  How long is this?  One-liners.  We got, we got hours.  Oh, it doesn't stop.  Oh, my God.  We got hours.  The whole thing goes on and on forever on YouTube.  On YouTube, it's, uh, like a seven and a half minute, uh, bit.  I gotta see this when I get home. 
[01:33:00]  A ham.  Oh, it's, it's a howl, man.  This thing is going to get, uh, viewed like crazy.  You mean IRS?  So that makes this a seizure kit.  And Mr. Whitley, a liar.  Murder multiplied by 15 years.  So we have a victim that started the weekend, big man on campus, and ended it dead on arrival.  The victim of the blast. 
[01:33:30]  Or the cause of it.  It's not looking too good, Horatio.  On the contrary, there's a chance this girl is alive, and we are going to find her.  This is, I, I gotta, I gotta watch the show to believe this.  Yeah.  I can't even watch YouTube, because they could talk to me.  Just look at, look at the video, and look at his, he'll stop, he'll deliver his line, 
[01:34:00]  and then leave the scene, and then anything outside, you'll see him with the, here's sunglasses.  Gotta be.  No, out of the, out of the frame.  So the, the music part, the thing.  There it is.  Dana, yeah.  In this video, the music part.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Whoever, whoever cut this up, keeps putting the picture in Miami,  and the boat with the big fan in the back.  Yeah, yeah.  It's put together brilliantly.  Sunglasses.  Give us the sunglasses.  Sunglasses.  Go on.  Deliver the line.  And exit. 
[01:34:30]  And exit stage left.  Sunglasses.  Deliver the line.  And I'm out of here.  I know it's a visual.  No way.  No way.  There it is again.  And I'm out of here.  We just watched five in a row.  He gets paid top dollar to come in, put the sunglasses on, say something dramatic, and leave.  When does the show come on?  I have to watch it again.  It's on every night of the week at this point.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  How many times can you? 
[01:35:00]  Who knows?  I gotta watch it.  Hey, we got, you know, we got a little more after the break.  A little more David Caruso, CSI, one-liner montage.  Oh, he's great.  A little more after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony.  Shhh.  Oh.  We're on the same page.  That's why I slowed down.  I was trying to point it at him.  Let's do it.  Uh, what, uh, what, uh, what show is this?  The show is the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.

The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're in the middle of, uh, talking about this video that Anthony found overnight and, uh, people 
[01:36:00]  are going to be viewing this like crazy on YouTube.  David Caruso, CSI, one-liner montage.  Montage.  Yeah, David Caruso, uh, on one of the most popular shows on television.  CSI.  CSI Miami.  Miami, right.  I mean, it's highly rated.  People are watching this thing in droves.  And it turns out he's probably the worst actor since, like, Shatner a la Star Trek. 
[01:36:30]  That, that, that cornball over-the-top delivery.  The delay.  The dramatic putting on and removal of the sunglasses.  The guy is, is there, is there a dimension less than one?  Because that's what he is.  He's more than just single-dimensional.  He's worse than, uh, Doug McClure.  Doug McClure.  Yeah, Troy McClure.  It's Doug McClure. 
[01:37:00]  Doug McClure's the real dude.  Yeah, he's the real actor.  Oh.  Oh.  He's great.  Yeah.  All right, want to go back to this?  Hickory dickory dock.  The mouse ran up the clock.  I don't think he knows what time it is.  Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet.  But I don't think she's getting her way. 
[01:37:30]  He's great.  Come on.  Let's go back to it.  I need more.  Wait, we need more.  We need more, Dave Kerr.  Yeah, here we go.  We need it.  Crime change.  Mr. Seaborn, you are about to lose your five-star status.  The last one to see her alive?  That's correct.  And Frank, you better move quickly because right now, I'm your only suspect. 
[01:38:00]  My wife, no matter how you cut it, the war sucks.  Frank, it's a killer.  And this is the purpose of dead bodies everywhere, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This is all over top of a dead body.  Dead body with frozen eyes.  They're constantly discussing these things, and he's delivering these hack lines in front  of dead bodies.  That's his audience.  Alex, Miami has a new breed of criminal. 
[01:38:30]  What are you going to do?  I am going to get to the truth.  Going to get to the line.  How about that?  Yeah, no kidding.  How about just getting to the line?  Forget the truth.  I, I, I'm going to eat.  I'm hungry. 
[01:39:00]  I'm hungry.  He's got quite a little business on his hands.  Yes, he does, Frank.  He also has murdered one.  I'm going to break.  Got caught in the crossfire.  That's what happens when worlds collide.  That's what happens when worlds collide.  Excuse me, I'll have a Whopper with cheese and a French fry. 
[01:39:30]  Want a Coke with that?  By the way, uh, oh.  No.  Exactly.  We're giving it too much.  His answer is like that.  You can't give it any thought.  Would you like to supersize that?  No.  You know, Stan just pointed out, you can say it's, it's a killer after anything.  After anything.  Yeah, well, you know, I, uh, went to the gas station.  Jesus Christ.  It was like $3 a gallon.  Yep.  Filling up. 
[01:40:00]  It's a killer.  Old cabbie leg from whack bag.  These are not cut up, Patrice.  He does a one-liner at the start of every show, and it goes right into the intro.  Yep.  Holy moly.  Yeah, there you go.  Someone's saying, make fun, but it's an awesome show.  Oh, yeah?  Whatever, Tim.  Uh, David.  David?  I thought it was David Caruso, though.  Oh, yeah.  You can make fun, but it's an awesome show.  It would have only been David Caruso called it. 
[01:40:30]  Listen, fellas, I don't care what you say.  They make me do it, but it's a great show.  No one should be defending this.  Right.  Like, that is, like, in the 60s, somebody goes, what is with this Captain Kirk guy?  He goes, listen, you can say all you want, but I'm going to tell you, this guy is, he,  he is Sklansklovsky trained.  Now, what is this?  Sklansklovsky.  I had no idea.  Whatever.  It's like, why?  Can't I kill him?  I don't care what you say.  Yes.  You're classically trained.  You're, uh, in the Sklansky, Sklansky class of acting or whatever. 
[01:41:00]  I find you to be a beautiful woman.  Some dumb, blonde Russian taught you how to act.  Are you serious?  Like, no one can defend this in this way.  Yes.  You're a beautiful woman.  Spark analysis.  Hey, here's David from Sacramento.  David.  What's up, boys?  What's up, David?  Hey, uh, I don't know about you guys, but every time I hear Caruso, Caruso makes that 
[01:41:30]  dramatic pause.  I keep waiting to hear,  Yeah.  Hey, that's really good.  All right, let's get back to it.  We have one more montage.  Um, let me tell you something, Mission Control.  Of course, it's been one small step for a man, but  It's a giant leap for mankind.  Caruso on the moon, thank you.  How about Caruso?  Uh, ick, benign, belinner. 
[01:42:00]  I was going to go with the other JFK, which makes sense in the David Caruso fashion.  Ask not.  Ask not what your country can do for you.  Ask what you can do.  Sunglasses.  For your country.  You know, President's quotes are very David Caruso.  David Caruso.  It's, there's nothing to fear.  But fear itself. 
[01:42:30]  I've been to the mountaintop.  I have a dream.  Four score and 20 years ago.  Read my lips.  No.  New.  Taxes.  Hey, uh, Rich from D.C.  They should play the daltry clip on Dateline. 
[01:43:00]  You came here for snacks.  For snacks.  Caruso.  I have Caruso do it.  It's out Friday wide.  Yeah.  Anything works.  They're coming in like crazy.  I need some feedback now.  I did not have sexual relations with that woman.  Not once.  John from Minnesota.  This is getting boring.  And John, go somewhere else.  Because we're having a blast.  Go after yourself. 
[01:43:30]  I cannot get enough of that.  How bad.  This guy is a millionaire.  Right.  There's, you know how many people out there trying to make a couple of dollars and fool  the public?  And he is just, every week, he's just like, you know, ham is expensive.  Why?  Like, nothing.  Well, let me tell you something.  This is a day that'll live in infamy.  Hey, Chris from Jersey and bingo was his name. 
[01:44:00]  Do we have any more Caruso?  Yeah, we have one more montage.  This thing goes on forever on YouTube.  We just took a few samples.  Someone else is adding, Johnny from Brooklyn, I earned that cake.  Back to David Caruso.  I'm the Mojave of Tarisha.  Yes.  And it's time to head back.  He might be trying to get our attention. 
[01:44:30]  I don't know.  But he just got mine.  Come on.  It's a stab wound.  Alex, that just narrowed us down to one.  What?  You can call an ass.  Yes, Frank.  A dead body can have that effect on you.  The verdict's already in.  The verdict is in, Frank.  But the jury's out. 
[01:45:00]  Real dramatic there.  They found more than that.  All we've got is that phone.  It's your status.  He's either dead or dying.  Yeah.  The day was pretty high.  Looks like Mike didn't have died in there by choice.  So if he didn't die, he's pushed.  She was famous for being famous.  All eyes trained on her every move.  All except her last one. 
[01:45:30]  This, this, they have to be, this really might be genius.  And because, you know, if you watch it every week, now I'm sitting there, okay, somebody prefaces this with this is every week.  Yeah.  This guy does this before the, blah!  Yep.  So you figure, you, as you watch every week, you're waiting for your popcorn.  Everybody's like, Marvel, hurry up, the popcorn.  Quick, here comes the part.  Here comes what I'm waiting for.  And every week they're waiting for, oh, this one.  And then, you know. 
[01:46:00]  His phrase and his sunglasses thing.  Speed killed.  Yeah.  And it's like, yeah!  Speed killed.  So the rest of the 48 minutes of the show, you just don't even care.  No.  You're just high off of speed killed.  You just, did you hear him?  Did you see him?  What an ass.  Oh.  Let's go to East Meadow.  Dan, what's up?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, as Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.  Yeah, you're right.  Presidential speech is just really perfect for this.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right. 
[01:46:30]  Well, there you go.  It's on YouTube, the video.  Yeah, check it out because the video makes it even better.  Makes it even better.  Because the observation Anthony had with him just exiting out of the frame every time.  Out of the frame.  Exit stage right even.  David Caruso.  Man, did he just win the lottery.  Someone that bad of an actor.  That cheesy.  And money hand over fist on the biggest show on television.  Evil Pete from OAXperience.com, New York City. 
[01:47:00]  He's doing a Voss impression.  I owe my daughter money.  And then in parentheses he writes, put glasses on.  And then, and I'm dodging her.  I'm dodging her.  It can't get boring.  It gets boring when it's done.  It's almost like listening to a song 50 times in a row before you even, it starts to get boring.  Because you can't, it was, was, was it fascinating about this is you can't believe this is real.  I cannot believe that this is going out over the public airwaves, television hit show hit. 
[01:47:30]  It's a hit.  It's, we're not talking about something that's been on a week.  It's going to get canceled.  This is the number one show on television week after week.  We're not talking about Armed and Famous.  We're talking about CSI Miami.  What part of the show is that music from?  The beginning.  No, no, no.  Is that how it's the show starts?  That's what someone was saying.  It starts with a dramatic one-liner from David Caruso right into the, and then they roll the credits over the rest of the song. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  You got the boats.  You got Miami.  You got the sunset.  You know.  Oh, yeah.  This just in.  To most Germans, this simply can't be funny.  I really had to liberate, first of all, myself from a certain kind of monster image and oversized, stony image that I had from Hitler.  Danny Levy is the director of Germany's first Hitler comedy, and he's Jewish. 
[01:48:30]  Many in Germany states look at the Jewish.  Yeah, this story needed something.  He's Jewish.  This story needed something.  A Hitler comedy, finally.  Oh, no, no.  Sorry.  The Jewish acting professor already deported to a Nazi concentration camp, is put into service. 
[01:49:00]  out of desperation.  Oh, this is hysterical.  So a concentration camp Jew is helping Hitler kind of fire up his personality again.  Yeah, it's a comedy about Hitler.  Get the people back.  Yeah, it's a comedy about Hitler called Mein Feuer. 
[01:49:30]  And then they ask this question.  Do you think Germany is ready for this?  Because, I mean, obviously people in this country, they learn very early on that there's one thing you don't joke about.  It's the Holocaust.  I don't joke about the Holocaust, and there's no jokes about the victims.  I joke about the Nazis.  Yeah.  But some Jewish leaders in Germany are appalled even at the thought of a comedy about Hitler.  For Hitler and for Auschwitz, there is a burner.  You can't make humor about millions of murder people. 
[01:50:00]  And so the first Hitler comedy in Germany is already something its director never wanted it to be.  A highly political movie.  Well, what about Hogan's Heroes?  Yeah, what about Hogan's Heroes?  That was a comedy.  It didn't star Hitler, but it starred his picture.  And what's his name?  And what about seven of the movie shows of the Three Stooges?  Right.  Where they poke Hitler in the eye with the two fingers.  Yeah, exactly.  But there was actually a... 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah, Three Stooges took on Adolf Hitler.  They took on everything.  Of course, Frankenstein.  Oh, cool.  They gave Hitler a noogie.  Yeah, like, whoop, whoop, whoop, Hitler, watch out.  You know, that fingers in the eyeball thing.  Hitler fell for the old hand waving in front of his face a couple of times.  Pulled his mustache down and it rolled back up like a shade.  Yeah.  Everyone took on Hitler.  Finally, Germany's jumping into the fray, making a little comedy.  Bugs Bunny took on Hitler.  Bugs Bunny.  You're not going to see that on TV anymore. 
[01:51:00]  It's one of those band cartoons.  Oh.  Bunga, bunga, inga, binga, binga, bunga.  No more.  No more.  No more.  The African cooking some guy in a pot.  No more.  That was some great stuff.  Oh, nature boy.  Yeah.  There he was.  Ah, with a spear.  Bunga, bunga, bunga.  Bunga, bunga, bunga.  Bunga, bunga, bunga.  Bunga, bunga, bunga, inga, binga.  And Tom and Jerry stopped all. 
[01:51:30]  They used to do a lot of racial stuff, too.  Yeah.  Questionable.  They took no more black maid Tom and Jerry's.  No.  And no more where Tom would get burned up and he would come out of a pile and he would go,  don't you believe it may be all burned up and fucking, you know.  There used to be an old big black one.  Now you shoo, kitty.  You shoo.  Shoo him out of the house.  Plenty of Hitler stuff.  Hitler is mild compared to some of the stuff they would play on those cartoons. 
[01:52:00]  I guess Germany, you know, still a little sore spot.  The Germans apparently are so guilty about the whole thing that they're doing a comedy about it is a bit much.  And they banned the swastika and everything, right?  I mean, yeah.  Well, they banned any type of thing like this.  Under the form of art, you're able to display the swastika.  Like, this movie's full of swastikas, of course.  But, yeah, they don't put up for any anti-Semitism over there. 
[01:52:30]  Let's say hi to Maria.  Maria?  Yep, it's Marie.  Marie, what's up?  I have another David Caruso line.  Okay.  One time they did an episode on midgets and David Caruso said,  it looks like we have a little murder.  No, we didn't.  Now that would be funny, though.  There you go.  Standing over a dead midget body.  All right, we'll get into some other things after the break.  Yeah.  Some things. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  We'll keep it at that.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-3.  Opie and Anthony.  Yo, this show rocks.  Thanks, buddy.  Where are you calling from?  Thrasherville, USA.  And what do you got for the show?  Pain.  This place is painful enough, buddy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony Show.  At 866-313-FREE. 
[01:53:30]  Rock!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Is it?  That's right.  It is.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  I got to thank.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Start the rumors quick.  I got to thank our NYPD.  Yeah.  New York's finest. 
[01:54:00]  We got a little.  We support the NYPD, and I also want to say, because they don't get along, but we also  support the fire department here in New York City, and there's a big thing going on.  I know I jumped on your story, and I apologize, but it is a big story today.  They're all up in arms because they're not allowed to put things on their lockers.  On their lockers.  Let the fire guys put whatever the hell they want on their lockers.  It's killing me, man.  Yeah, apparently something was a little sexually heated. 
[01:54:30]  That's how it all begins.  And that's how it started.  Right.  Some maybe pin-up picture or something, and one guy.  It was probably a guy, too, believe it or not.  It's obvious to say it was a chick fire department, fire person or whatever.  Why would it be a guy?  It was someone that was offended by something that was on someone's lockers, so now the policy  is pretty much nothing on lockers whatsoever.  Guys put American flags up there, support our troops, and they have prayer cards from funerals 
[01:55:00]  of friends from 9-11 that they put up there, pictures of 9-11, their family, and everything  has to come down.  These guys run into flaming buildings.  Could you let them put some crap on their locker, you idiots?  Just to get them through life.  They make it sound like they sit in cubicles all day, typing on their, you know, typing  out reports.  These guys are risking their lives every day.  Let them put whatever they want on their lockers, you dopes.  It's a huge story here in New York, and you know, they get rid of everything instead of  maybe figuring it out and going, all right, maybe no nude shots. 
[01:55:30]  I don't know.  I think they should be able to have whatever the hell they want.  Hardcore porn if they want.  Whatever they want, sure.  It should be based on the firehouse and what they think.  If somebody has a problem with it, they should discuss it between each other like humans.  Like someone go, hey, dude, I'm a little offended by what you got on your locker.  And then the guy could tell him to go screw himself, and then he could maybe take it up  a notch and say, I'm going to go to the superior or something like that.  Nothing gets handled like that anymore. 
[01:56:00]  It becomes a big controversy where then all of a sudden they go from zero to no tolerance policy.  They go from put whatever you want to nothing.  Oh, my God.  There's no more dialogue.  There's no discussing things anymore.  There's no hammering out a solution, a compromise.  There's just, this happened?  All right, get rid of everything.  It's not fair to the firemen.  No, we got a fireman on the line, Eddie from New York, of course.  Eddie, what's up? 
[01:56:30]  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I'm a retired paramedic with New York City EMS.  And let me tell you, what's going on with the fire department, it's a freaking disgrace.  It's a disgrace.  So you guys go out, okay, they break their asses, they run into a burning building.  Nothing against the cops.  When there's a shooting, they can turn around and run.  But when there's a fire, these guys are going in there, you know?  So you're not allowed to have anything on your lockers, right?  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  And how did this start?  I really don't know, because we were away for a few days. 
[01:57:00]  What's going on is, there was a picture of a woman on a locker.  I think that was in the paper, too.  I think you saw that.  Okay.  And they had a word.  The C word was scratched into it.  You've got to love these guys.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Let's break this down.  It's kind of laughing.  Who is this woman?  Was it someone the fireman knew, or was it just a picture from a magazine?  I'm not sure.  It was probably your next wife, you know?  Okay. 
[01:57:30]  You know what I'm saying?  I just love crap like that.  I've had the C word scratch.  And that's the thing.  It's just a heroin story.  You're with them.  And usually this guy's voice just bothers me, like this type of like, hey, and then this  guy.  And I'm like, hey.  I'm really being like, wow, this is terrible.  And he's like, you know, it's just a C word scratched in it.  It's just like there's a picture of Barack Obama on it.  And they go, it's just an N word scratching through his face, minding his business.  All right.  But the point being, because of that, they're telling these guys they can't have anything 
[01:58:00]  on their lockers.  That's completely ridiculous.  They're treating them like school kids.  Right.  So some guy, you know, has to take down a picture of him and his family from Disney World or whatever.  Because someone scratched the C word over his wife's face.  That is so key.  Hey, man.  The guy has to give up half his pay.  Hey, the least he should be able to do is have a picture of her on his locker with  the word C across her mouth.  Right.  You know, you've got a lot of the fallen brothers.  They want their pictures taken down. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, there's no reason for that.  Come on.  These are the guys that risk their lives every day.  Do you think in the few weeks after 9-11 that if this happened, every citizen in this  city would run over and be protesting in favor of the firemen on this thing?  You would think so.  Yeah.  But it doesn't happen.  That's not true.  What happened to the signs?  Heroes.  Thank you, our heroes.  And then all of a sudden people just go, I don't care. 
[01:59:00]  Whatever.  I shouldn't be able to have it.  Anyway, I don't care.  I don't want any trouble.  Yeah, no trouble.  Don't make any waves.  Let the firemen put whatever they want on there.  Just shut up and leave them alone.  They run into burning buildings.  The second, if you want to run into burning buildings, then you decide what they should  have on their locker.  Thank you.  All right, Eddie.  It's a locker.  Eddie, keep up the fight, all right?  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Yeah, it's a locker.  And keep the C-word out of the story. 
[01:59:30]  Just leave that out.  Because we would have never asked.  We would have never investigated.  Like, wait a minute.  Did she have any C-word, anything, scratched on her face?  You would never ask that.  You just go, it's a naked chick.  I'm glad.  Boy, I sure didn't see that coming.  But I interrupted you, Ann.  I'm sorry.  So I want to thank NYPD once again.  Once again.  I may have been a little overzealous in my driving this morning to get to my job. 
[02:00:00]  By the way, this is...  On time.  This is twice in one week you had an altercation with the NYPD.  Yeah.  And that includes taking three days off to go to Vegas.  Yeah.  Within the last week, including the three days you weren't even in New York, you've been  interrupted by the NYPD.  Yeah.  Twice.  I don't know what's wrong.  I just got to calm down, I guess.  I'm just driving.  And it's the Long Island Expressway.  And it's always a mess, except for when I drive in.  There's no one on it, and it's wonderful. 
[02:00:30]  And I do about 80.  I average about 80 the whole way.  In the left lane.  I'm very attentive to what I'm doing.  And there was a cab, a New York City cab, driving in the left lane with a tractor trailer  in the middle lane, and I didn't want to go all the way over and do the right lane sweep.  So I get behind the cab, and he's not moving.  He's staying.  He's pacing a tractor trailer in the left goddamn lane. 
[02:01:00]  And I'm right behind him.  Now I start moving over a little, so my headlight gets in his side view mirror and reflects right  into his face.  Love that move, by the way.  Right into his face.  It's a great move.  It's a great move to have.  And he's inching just barely a quarter mile an hour faster than the truck.  And I'm just getting so friggin' frustrated that the second it opens up, I, boom, cut in,  and I'm off in the middle lane to pass him.  I don't know where this guy came from. 
[02:01:30]  Man, he was in a black unmarked.  And all of a sudden...  Well, that's where he came from.  Yeah, exactly.  Unmarked.  Exactly.  And it was pure black.  Uh, in my mirror, the darkness behind me turned into close encounters.  It just lit up out of nowhere.  And I was like, oh my God.  Getting pulled over.  So I just, I pulled to the side.  Guy comes over to my passenger side and just starts lambasting me, yelling at me.  Do you know how close you are to that vehicle? 
[02:02:00]  I was like, yeah, I was probably a lot closer than I should have been, officer.  Did you say that?  Yeah.  Okay.  And he goes, how close were you?  I go, I really don't know.  He goes, you were about 15 feet.  And you were going too fast.  Knowing you, you were 15 inches.  Oh, believe me.  And he goes, and you were going too fast.  And I was going, yeah, officer, I understand.  He goes, what if he would have slammed on his brakes?  And meanwhile, in my head, I'm thinking, I'd have slammed on mine.  I wouldn't hit him. 
[02:02:30]  But I go, no, I understand.  You know, I'm in a bit of a rush.  And when a cab is just paced in a tractor trailer like that in the left lane, I got a little frustrated.  License and registration and your insurance.  And he goes back to the car.  And I was so flustered.  I was like, holy Jesus, I didn't hand him any of my cards.  You know, my special cards.  My little cards that kind of say I. 
[02:03:00]  My get out of anything cards.  Yeah.  Other people have get out of maybe a speeding ticket.  Anthony's got get out of anything cards.  Anthony pretty much has a police officer's uniform at this point.  I believe he has a get out of murder card.  He comes back to the window a few minutes later, and I'm thinking he wrote me up.  Finally.  Yeah.  You get out of these all the time.  He comes over.  He hands me my stuff.  He just goes, look, I'm not going to write you up.  But he goes, I know what you drive, and I got your name. 
[02:03:30]  He goes, don't let me see you driving like that again around here.  Like, okay, officer, I'm sorry.  Thank you very much.  And the second, again, the second he pulled me over, two fingers, boom, the lights go on inside the cab.  The windows go down.  My hands go right up on the steering wheel.  Makes them feel comfy.  They don't feel like they got to worry that I'm going to pull something out or it's too dark for them to see.  You got to set it up a little.  Well, you got to make the officer comfortable with the traffic stop. 
[02:04:00]  Don't make him think he's risking his life pulling you over.  So the windows come down.  The lights go on.  He knows that I'm not doing anything, and I have all my information.  I give it to him.  And without using a card or saying who I was or anything like that, he came over and let me off the hook.  Yeah, but.  Nice.  Thank you, Wave.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You said thank the EM.  No, I said thank the NYPD and then open it to the Feynman.  Yeah, yeah.  I completely changed subjects on Anthony by accident there. 
[02:04:30]  But our NYPD friends.  Yeah.  I'm thinking there's something on that master computer now.  Oh, do you think?  Yeah.  They punch on him in a license and he goes, this guy's hysterical.  Just let him go.  There's something that pops up on that screen because you get out of a ticket every single time.  It's something that pops up on my hand of my license.  It's my white hand.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like you just said that with some little pompous, all right, complaining Negroes and Puerto Ricans.  This is what you do to not get a ticket. 
[02:05:00]  He was kind of looking at you.  Yeah.  He was kind of looking at you.  So in this diss, you know, I just want to swear right now.  I know you don't.  But in this story that you're telling, it's like the moral of the story, children, is just do what you're supposed to and you get out of a ticket.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not what happens to me.  I have to pull out all of my get out of murder card just to get out of a ticket.  Yeah.  And they give me a berating with the get out of murder card.  See, but Patrice, I enjoy listening to the stories of the black man having problems with the police. 
[02:05:30]  I love when they're just driving, abiding by the laws and get pulled over and some problem happens.  I adore those stories.  So I figured I would share with you what white people go through when they get pulled over.  Let me tell you something.  We give each other a wink.  I have I have fresh soil with roses growing out of my truck just so I can give one of the flowers to her.  I open all my windows and my back door and I have a child with me. 
[02:06:00]  My girl, my girlfriend's kid just to say, officer, how are you doing?  And I tell her, do a little dance like Shirley Temple.  You put on a little child dance.  And the child is the same color as you.  And same thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And she has a passport that says she's my child today.  You turn off Hot 97 and put on Light FM.  Oh, yeah.  I put on 1,000.8.  As a matter of fact, I put on 1,502 on AM.  And I'm going, I tell you, Bush is a pip. 
[02:06:30]  Is there a problem, officer?  All of that.  All of that crap you just said.  I still get problems.  I still have to pull out.  My friends with officer cards.  Yeah.  And I shouldn't.  You should have gotten a ticket for that.  You're right.  There is a double standard.  Yeah.  It's too bad.  All right, let's move on.  There is a double standard.  Too bad.  Let's move on.  Let's move on, white Gregory and white Anthony.  This boring old stuff.  Because I do the same thing.  Matter of fact, I would get pulled over in my rollerblades. 
[02:07:00]  Why spend time, you know, stating the obvious?  Let's just move on.  Exactly.  It is what it is.  And we're not going to change it with our dumb talk shows.  Let's move on.  It is one of those things that's so obvious.  You live, Patrice.  Why do we?  Oh, disgusting.  White has its privileges.  Poor Patrice just out.  It's probably a nice summer day.  He figures, you know, I'm going to work out a little bit. 
[02:07:30]  I'm going to strap on some rollerblades and just go down the street.  Okay.  This is fun.  I really, you know, I ought to.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What the hell?  Yeah.  All right.  No, I'm pulling over to the curb.  What the?  Oh, officer.  What did I do?  Oh, please take your feet out the roller skates.  They don't have blinkers.  No.  They don't have signals.  I can't take them off this quickly because. 
[02:08:00]  No, no, no.  Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.  Being tased on your rollerblades.  When's it going to stop?  That's just amazing.  Maybe in a couple hundred more years.  If you put your hands on your goofy white little.  You must be nice and visible, especially because it's dark.  That's all?  It's dark, actually.  My side window, I saw that he was coming up on the passenger side. 
[02:08:30]  So my back and front passenger window went down so he can see inside the entire vehicle.  That was a moving violation you did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's going to be points on your license.  Thank God.  Something is going on because, I mean, he gets out of everything.  No, I just want to thank, you know, if the officer or somebody he knows that's patrolling  the LIE at that hour or something.  I just want to thank the guy, you know, for you gave me a shot.  We got friends in high places, and there's something that pops up when they punch in 
[02:09:00]  your info.  I didn't tell him anything.  Something punches up.  I don't know.  I just want to thank him.  That's all.  Unfortunately, we're running out of show, but I want to say poor Mark McGuire.  Poor Mark McGuire.  What happened to him?  All 150 pounds of him.  Oh, because he's just fading away.  He did not make the Hall of Fame.  Can he seesaw with Travis now?  Is that what we're talking?  Poor guy.  He plays golf.  He's about 150 pounds, soaking wet.  He will not be voted into the Hall of Fame. 
[02:09:30]  He'll get in the Hall of Fame when the bums on his back clear up.  Mark McGuire is a skinny old man with spectacles that Ben Franklin, Ben Franklin specs he's  got.  He was a giant monster two days ago.  Huge.  He hit the arms.  He retired, and now he's 150 pounds playing golf.  What happened?  He was whacking baseballs into parking lots.  He looks like Bette Midler now.  Bette Midler.  And someone's going to say, I don't know. 
[02:10:00]  There's no conclusive proof of the steroid use with him.  Yeah, they didn't prove anything with him, but the voters of the Hall of Fame said, no,  you're not going into the Hall of Fame.  Something's going on with you.  The guy pretty much, him and Sosa, the battle, brought baseball back from the strike.  Oh, yeah.  And they were loving him when he was doing it.  They were loving him.  Hitting 70 home runs at 48 years old.  The guy was entertaining as hell to watch.  He'd step up. 
[02:10:30]  The cameras.  Remember that?  Every time he'd swing, you would see the stands just like strobes going on.  Light up like it's a Rolling Stones concert.  He had muscles on his back that they haven't even named yet.  He's growing.  On the muscle chart, it's just like this is the whatever-zoid.  And he had something else.  It's like fighting new planets.  They're fighting new muscles because of him.  Just name it the Maguire-zoid on his neck.  That thing that connects your ears to the tips of your shoulders. 
[02:11:00]  Poor Mark Maguire.  And they're chasing Barry down for this.  Oh, yeah.  They're chasing him down for this.  And now they're like, you know, the report.  Barry Bonds got...  He was tested positive for drinking iced tea.  Yeah.  Aspartame.  He was tested positive for aspartame.  Well, it came out last night.  He got tested for what?  Amphetamines.  I don't even know what that does.  What is that?  It's not even a violation.  The first time, they let you go.  The second time, they suspend you.  The first time, they don't even report it.  Supposedly, they can't report it.  But now it leaked that he did test positive for amphetamines in 06. 
[02:11:30]  What?  The implied criminality doesn't count in this world.  He was part of the generation of baseball where they all did steroids.  But they never caught Mark Maguire.  They didn't catch Mark Maguire.  But it's so obvious now that he shrunk.  They caught Pete Rose.  That's what I'm saying.  I like to see Pete Rose go to the Hall of Fame.  But they caught him.  It's not implied that he gambled.  It's not implied that he did what he did. 
[02:12:00]  They caught him gambling on his own sport.  But these guys haven't been caught.  But his achievements are what they were.  Mm-hmm.  No matter what.  Yeah.  The guy should be in the Hall of Fame based on his achievements in the sport.  Not on, you know, what he did.  Well.  The gambling thing.  Before the show, we were trying to figure out the baseball player that was a card-carrying member of the club.  Ty Cobb.  Was it Ty Cobb?  Ty Cobb?  We're not really sure.  He was a dirty racist.  What?  How do you know Babe Ruth?  What are you saying in the office?  How do you know Babe Ruth didn't take some kind of creepy cocaine back in 1912? 
[02:12:30]  Might have.  To smack home runs.  But we just didn't test for that.  No one cared.  There was no testing.  What was your line about Ty Cobb?  That same bat he was using.  He was beating niggas in the head.  That same bat.  He would hit four runs and then go, you know what?  I'm going to hit a nigga in the head with this one.  With no cork in it.  His batting average after the game was 1,000%.  He didn't miss a thing. 
[02:13:00]  Practice on a black hand.  I got to hit this white ball every day.  I don't like it.  On the way back to the trolley, he hit everything in sight.  Oh, the wrong color.  Oh, man.  I think he made a decree to change the color of the ball to black with little hair on it  so it looked like an afro.  So he could just smack that out of the park every time.  A thousand home runs by Ty Cobb.  Unfortunately, my God, that ball has hit a woman.  We must string it up.  Unfortunately, we have to get the hell out of here. 
[02:13:30]  Hang that ball.  It struck a white woman.  Hey, ball, what you doing looking at that white woman?  Come here.  And Patrice made the point, you know, when you turn 40 in baseball, that's not when you  should have some of your best numbers.  And he pointed out that when Hank Aaron hit his final home run, he had a little pouch.  He was a little fat man.  You see that little fat man, like, limping across with his little fat ouch in his...  You can see he looked like a...  You know he looked like a Haitian cab driver, Hank Aaron, when he was running across when he 
[02:14:00]  hit them home runs.  Ouch, look at how fat they were and out of shape.  Cal Ripken's the same size as when he played.  He's just a skinny little dude, man.  Yeah, yeah.  So you know these guys are doing something.  Of course they were.  You don't peak in athleticism in your 40s.  I'm at 40.  You're not peaking.  Michael Jordan is fat now.  He is.  He's fat.  But Barry Bonds continues to grow muscles where muscles never grew before.  Unbelievable.  And Mark McGuire looks like... 
[02:14:30]  He looks like the skeleton.  He looks like the guy who played the Scarecrow in Batman Returns.  All right.  With that, we got to leave, unfortunately.  A little old guy.  Patrice.  Great job today.  Patrice O'Neal.  PatriceO'Neal.com?  Yes.  PatriceO'Neal.com.  Have you updated that dumb website of yours?  I don't know.  All right.  Well, you got a couple dates here.  Ohio State, January 18th.  And for everyone listening in Providence, it'll be at Catch a Rising Star January 26th and January 27th. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you.  With that, we got to get out of here.  If you're not joining us on XM Satellite Radio, we'll see you tomorrow.  Thanks for listening.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Actually, the walkover's half over.  It's too cold to walk.  Yeah.  Matter of fact, I think we lost Patrice. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, we ditched Patrice.  Is he waiting out there for us?  I walked out.  You know how we normally stop in front of the building, even for a real short period of time?  We kind of just hang out there for a little bit.  Say hi to the fans and stuff.  Say hi to the fans and stuff.  A couple of people that are out there.  Yeah, today, nope.  I didn't stop.  Didn't even look at him.  Kept walking.  It's going to be quicker walks until this weather changes back to, what, spring or whatever.  Yeah.  Next week, I think.  50s.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, really.  I think, yeah, starting tomorrow, it's going to be back in the 50s here. 
[02:16:00]  I'd be happy with a complete lack of winter, believe me.  Well, I saw Patrice flirting with some girl from Free FM in the hallway, and we just walked  past him, and he's nowhere to be found.  Oh.  Anyway.  Oh, good duck.  This is bullshit.  It gets a lot worse than this, too.  And this isn't even that bad.  I know.  This is doable.  I know.  This is about as far as I can go dressed like this. 
[02:16:30]  I would have to be even more layered.  We still want to encourage the fans to join us for the walkover.  We'll bring you upstairs.  Kenny's outside.  He'll bring some people up.  We're heading toward the elevators.  We'll see you upstairs.  Colby and Anthony.  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Thank you. 
[02:20:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:21:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:21:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:22:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[02:22:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Convincing them that they're going to be extra space in my life.  Right.  That's it.  That you're going to be able to spend with them.  Yeah.  That ain't happening.  I was watching Cribs, like MTV Cribs or whatever, and they had like Russell Simmons' house.  And, you know, you sit there and you guys are closer than I am to like living that life.  So I got this.  That's for sure.  It's like a beautiful house.  And I just go, if I get one of those houses and I'm talking to my grandma, I'm going to 
[02:23:00]  definitely have a room with just hoes in it that when you come downstairs, you can  poke them back with a stick.  Get back, bitches.  The whole room.  The whole basement.  I throw meat in there for them to eat.  Meat and a little bit of cash.  And they whack their asses to get out and take them for a walk.  They have maybe a whole door to move and go outside for a minute.  Oh, God, if I get filthy rich.  God just ain't going to make me filthy rich because he just knows I'm going to do.  I'm getting killed. 
[02:23:30]  DJ Ana Lightbulb from posthorrors.net.  What happened?  Ew.  Opie, you did the arm punch.  I don't think it was.  Yeah.  I think it was more of like a tap.  He really did.  And that goes to show you that you do have an honest show because that's what he did.  Hey, good show, man.  Good show.  But it wasn't like.  You killed this morning.  So I just wanted to give you a little help.  It wasn't corny.  You know what it was?  It was just Opie's way of.  Sincere.  It's just Opie's just socially in trouble.  You know, and Opie tries to not socially be fucked up, but you don't. 
[02:24:00]  Like, Opie, you try.  You try to, like, go, hey, man, hey.  Do a couple of tickles.  Like, hey, bro.  Hey, man.  A couple of nipple squeezes.  No, no.  Figure it to nipple squeeze.  I'm not patting you on the fanny.  Hey, a little, you know, a little, like, hey, Coochie Coo, and Anthony's just nothing.  I will tell you when I am the most sociable, fun, and, like, I'm like that when I'm drinking. 
[02:24:30]  I get a few in me.  I'm your pal.  I'll back pat you.  I'm shaking hands.  I'm doing the shake hand, half hug, shoulder bump.  I am the most social creature.  That's the shug.  Yeah.  There's a few beers in me.  There's a sound you hear every morning when Anthony's coming out of his coffin.  There's, and he flies here, and he gets here, and as his overy goes, good night. 
[02:25:00]  That's it.  Good evening.  Good evening.  That is it for fucking Anthony.  Well, I'm done for the day.  But Opie will try.  He will give it a shot.  And then you can see it just pains him, and it makes him uncomfortable to do so.  I don't know if you're reading me right.  Whatever.  For the show, I guess that's fine.  I think I'd be.  Fuck you, nigga.  Don't be trying to be hurt. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, now he's all hurt.  I think I'm hurt.  Now he's all hurt.  For the show.  He just gave a punch, and you know what it is?  You do.  Listen, you do.  I just want to show my appreciation.  It makes the show better.  And that is why that's his way.  It's sincere.  See, what I'm saying to you is that's his way.  That's Opie's way of someone else's.  A punch in the arm from Opie is like a complete, full-fledged leg hump from another person. 
[02:26:00]  And me, you get nothing.  Nothing.  Not even enough.  All right.  Listen.  On the way over, just to change gears here, we were listening to the promo for the Money Snatch.  Oh, my God.  And I did a lot of talking while we were in Vegas for three days.  And, you know, we're in tweak mode.  Just a little tweak mode with the radio show.  We do this from time to time.  We take a good look at things, and we try to tweak things, make them better.  And, you know, we want to start bringing a little more of the edge back to the radio show and things like that. 
[02:26:30]  And we want to do Money Snatch again.  And we don't really understand why the women aren't clamoring to be on the show naked to run around and grab as much cash as humanly possible not using their hands.  It's money.  It's free money for any woman that wants it.  Right.  So we're thinking, my God, they have to be calling like crazy.  I was going to say like hotcakes. 
[02:27:00]  They're calling like hotcakes.  How can a hotcake dial a phone, Opie?  Well, let me put it this way, a little acting here.  After we play the promo for the Money Snatch, you know, it's the promo to get the women interested in doing this contest, this is what we get.  Yeah.  Not one calling.  And why?  Because they're flat out disgusted or scared.  Why? 
[02:27:30]  Again, why?  It's free money.  What could they possibly be getting turned off by?  And then it hit us.  Somebody brought it to our attention that it might be the promo that Steve came up with.  It could be the promo for this very event.  Now, I'm thinking the promo should be this.  Off the top of my head, I'm not going to get into detail, but we have a lot of money.  We would like girls to come up to the studio and win this money. 
[02:28:00]  Right.  Yes, there is a catch, ladies.  You cannot leave with the money in your hands or your mouth.  It has to be put in a certain part of your body that isn't used to carrying money.  Yeah.  Yes, it will be uncomfortable for a very short period of time.  But, hey, you're leaving with free money.  That's, you know, the gist of it.  And during the promo, as we explained Money Snatch, there should be excitement. 
[02:28:30]  There should be maybe girls going, oh, me, me, me, me, me.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, every girl in the world wants to be part of it, but we're only going to pick a select few.  Exciting.  A few lucky few.  Action, like, action music.  Like, that there's a, it's a competition.  Excitement.  Excitement in the air.  Women, yeah, women, like, oh, me.  Like, pick me.  Please, please.  I bet I win.  Right.  Something like that.  Kind of like we're giving out the golden tickets. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Like, everybody wants one.  This isn't something people want to be shunned for.  They want to be involved in this.  But we heard the promo that's playing.  And this could be the problem.  Wow.  This could be the problem.  So, Patrice, listen in to the Money Snatch promo.  We're going to stop this from time to time, Bill.  But instead, this is what we get.  And this could be the reason why the girls aren't clamoring.  Why no girl. 
[02:29:30]  Why they're not knocking at our door.  The hardest core, slut, whore, stripper, fuck anything, bitch isn't even calling because  she feels too degraded by this fucking promo.  And here it is.  We at the Opie and Anthony Show would like to give.  No, I was.  This is a stand by.  I'm going to cue you.  Holy shit.  Opie put his hand up and Bill stopped the whole thing. 
[02:30:00]  It was putting my hand up like, do you see me?  Because I'm going to cue you.  Start.  Oh, my God.  Those less fortunate.  No, no, no.  Now we've got to start over again.  Now we've got to start over.  I think he's very hard on it.  You see his face, Bill's face?  Bill freaks the fuck out.  And his face, he still doesn't even have to understand it as Opie's upset with him.  He's just.  Yeah.  He's just.  What did I do?  I'm sure.  What happened?  Under his breath, he's like, asshole.  I know.  I get it.  I'm an asshole, but we just want things to run a little smooth around here. 
[02:30:30]  So we knew the hand signals.  He'd be the one like, when the soldier does that fist up thing, he would like stand up  or start running.  You know what it means?  Like everybody just stop in place.  Hold it.  Yeah.  Hold position.  Keep your head down a little bit.  He'd be the one stepping.  Bill would be like, well, I thought it meant because your head represented a hand.  I mean, your hand represented a head and your forearm is the body to stand up straight.  And run at the enemy.  We got to demote him back to smelling homeless hooker twats. 
[02:31:00]  Wow.  Remember when you did that?  Yeah.  No problem with hand signals there.  Yeah.  Nose.  Point at nose.  And then we pointed at a trout.  And you knew exactly what to do.  All right.  So here is the money snatch promo.  And this is where the problem is.  I was going to stop you.  Whatever.  I'll do it again.  Here we go.  Bill.  We at the Opie and Anthony Show would like to give those less fortunate a chance to spread  joy to the ones they love. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  So far, so good.  So far, so good.  The music, a little depressing.  Right.  I'll give that.  This should be more of a, you know, we'd like to give a little more up.  A little more action.  The music itself is this dirge.  Right.  But so far, so good.  You're piquing the interest of the females.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, so far, I don't have much of a problem with it.  The promo continues.  And the best way we know how to spread joy is to spread cash.  All right.  Spread cash.  What?  Spread cash. 
[02:32:00]  You're a lady out there.  You're down on your luck.  You might have a few bills you need to pay.  At this point, I think you're even turning up your XF.  Your interest is piqued, let's say.  Right.  And now you're turning it up going, maybe this is something I want to get involved with.  I could use some extra cash.  You got your cell phone out.  You're ready to call.  Yeah.  The music's a little depressing, but I don't think they notice.  The message is, hey, money.  Money.  You got the opportunity.  And then this happens.  All over the floor and blow it around the room with a leaf blower while a bunch of screaming 
[02:32:30]  naked women frantically try to grab as much as they can.  It's the return of The Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're looking for desperate, broke, insecure women to come in studio, get naked, chase around  flying money, and cram as much of it into their holiest of holes, all in an effort to make  someone's life a little brighter.  We know how much you hate picking up clothes at the Goodwill.  And wouldn't it be nice to not have to dig through the garbage to find cigarettes? 
[02:33:00]  And wouldn't you love to take a dump in a functioning toilet and not a spackle bucket?  Of course you would.  So ladies, walk your broke ass down to your local public library.  Use their free internet and go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com for contest details.  Who the fuck is going to go after hearing that?  You're pretty much representing anybody that would come down for this as a homeless horse  skank that is digging through garbage and Goodwill to just eke out a survival. 
[02:33:30]  At this point, you're sick of the taste of cum.  Right, right.  And you need a new way of making money.  Just for a day, you'll get some extra money up your pussy and then go back to your shit life  of rummaging through garbage for food and rummaging through Goodwill for clothing because 
[02:34:00]  you're a skanky piece of shit.  Please come down.  Please.  We're banging you.  What happened?  My God.  I just don't understand why they're not calling.  Why?  Where's the...  The phones should be jammed after playing that.  What's the problem?  What could possibly be the problem, Steve?  But have you never done something where it was so degrading but people still... 
[02:34:30]  I mean, like the big fat fucker contest is kind of like...  You gotta be a...  Yeah.  But dude, the point is, we know it's a degrading contest but you don't wanna, you know, have  it on a freaking billboard.  Yeah.  Blinking and neon.  And fat people know they're fat.  You gotta be pathetic to join this contest.  Yeah.  You gotta trick them.  They know they're coming down.  Maybe Steve was having a burst of consciousness and he was just feeling sad where he had to 
[02:35:00]  go, you know, for you to do this...  Impossible.  For you to do this, you have to be a piece of dog shit to do this.  That would be impossible for Steve.  Impossible.  Conscience, any kind of...  No, no, no.  Well...  Well, how would you promote a contest where they would put money in the pussy?  I think you leave the putting money in the pussy part vague but obvious. 
[02:35:30]  You downplay the pathetic, Nick.  You down...  Yeah.  Pathetic-ness...  Of it.  Of it.  Of the girls involved.  That's what you learn in broadcasting.  The girls involved aren't pathetic messes that need the money or else they'll be sucking  a cock that night.  That's right.  They want to come down and be part of this because it's fun, it's exciting, it's on the  radio.  That's the reasoning.  Not the fact that they're sleeping in a box eating their own snot at night for dinner. 
[02:36:00]  That seems to be what Steve was gunning for here.  Well, if the porn...  Say the porno industry, if I wanted to start porn, I just...  What would I say to the...  How do they get them down?  Do you come on down if you're adventurous or you're fun-loving?  Yeah.  An actress that's into adventure.  But you don't say come down and have strange dicks pumped into every hole in your body,  you dumb cunt.  Uninhibited women needed for a film.  Exciting, adventurous, curious, perhaps.  Things you'd read, keywords that would be like, all right, I kind of know what this 
[02:36:30]  is all about, but not, you know, desperate cocksucker needed for movie, we will fill  your ass and cunt with cock and cum.  Come on down.  You know.  Make your daddy proud.  Right.  You know, shit like that.  Basically, we're looking for women that have had so much cum that they're now allergic to  it.  You always hear about those people.  Yeah, we want what we're calling hive pornography, where girls get cum on them and break out 
[02:37:00]  in hives because so much cum has been punished.  So much.  At this point, the body's saying enough, but the cum's rejecting cum like a bad kid.  It's just rejecting...  Through osmosis, they've gotten so many male hormones, they have balls.  Just from the cum on their skin seeping in.  That's how much jism...  That's who we're looking for, yes.  That's basically what we're saying out there.  There's a way to word these things where women will come down.  Exciting, adventure, curiosity, uninhibited. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Words like that.  Well, here's Steve C. live from Las Vegas, Nevada.  Steve.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm writing down what Ant just said.  That's going to make a good promo.  Oh, is it?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hi, Steve.  Sleep well.  Uh, yeah.  I can't...  I'm never going to get myself on a normal sleep schedule, but...  Is it 6-6-30 over there now?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like 6-30.  6-30.  But, uh...  But I'm sorry you guys don't like the promo. 
[02:38:00]  I'm just...  Well, now, as far as a Steve-type production thing goes, I like it because it's so brutal  and vicious and really captures your personality and hatred toward women, but...  Yeah, well, it's not about capturing my personality.  It's trying to entice people down there.  Entice people down here?  That's not a bad word, Steve.  Enticing is not...  That was a bad word to use.  Entice.  Sorry, Patrice.  We'd have better luck with a van going...  With a couch and a broken arm prop trying to get girls to help us load it in, and then 
[02:38:30]  we just punch them in the face.  Is she a big friend, woman?  Throw them all in a well, and we'll have our contest down there.  I'm going to run the couch and a bang!  Rich from Kansas City makes a great point, by the way.  Put the fucking money in your pussy!  Rich from Kansas City makes a great point.  You're looking for women that can't afford XM, basically.  That's true, too.  Yeah.  You're looking for the poorest of the poor.  We're going to blow around some money. 
[02:39:00]  They consider cum part of the daily requirement of protein.  Apparently, I was the only person with my eyes open the last time we did this money snatch  thing, because we're not exactly supermodel.  Well, we don't want to always state the obvious.  Let me tell you something.  You're not going to get an argument that maybe the girl that came down did fit the bill of  your promo.  They were a bit on the skanky side.  But their self-image is not what you're asking for. 
[02:39:30]  See, they think it's fun, it's for the radio, it's exciting.  It's all of those things for us.  And the second they walk through the room, all right, get naked.  Here's a rubber.  Put money in it.  Go.  Take your clothes off.  Jam some money in you.  There you go.  Hey, how's Vegas there, Steve?  You know what?  It's top notch.  Hot Movies is flying me out here to go to the AVNs and do what I usually do, which is 
[02:40:00]  ask humiliating questions and get called a faggot.  Yeah, you're collecting a lot of audio for the show for next week.  Yeah, well, today's going to be the first forum into the first entry into the expo.  And I'll head down there with Jimmy later on.  Well, one of my favorites from last year was the bear.  Remember the gay gentlemen that are big and hairy and they call themselves bears? 
[02:40:30]  And Steve talked with one of these gentlemen.  And that was where this very clip came from.  Grr.  The bear wanted Steve to growl like a bear.  And grr.  That's what Steve did.  That's him.  Grr.  At the AVN.  Yeah, this is the hardest part of this whole process.  It's not...  Look, this porn thing has gotten bigger and bigger every year.  I mean, this year the AVNs are at the Mandalay Bay Event Center, which is basically an arena. 
[02:41:00]  I mean, it's not in...  Up until then, it's been in a large, large banquet hall, for lack of a minute.  But it's huge this year.  I mean, there's porn people all over the place.  I mean, you know, there's CES people, sure.  But, and then, you know, within five feet of them, of the CES people, is some bleach blonde woman with big fake tits and collagen in her lips.  So, they're really all over the place.  I hate that look.  That collagen has fucked so many women up. 
[02:41:30]  You know who got it recently?  It was hysterical.  It's going through the channels.  And that Smallville was on.  And I guess it's one of these gimmicky, proppy...  Not proppy, but gimmick episodes.  They had Lois Lane from the original Superman movie playing some character.  So, it was...  What the hell is her name?  Kidder?  Kidder?  Yeah, Margot Kidder was on.  She had...  Remember how she had zero lips?  And no lips at all?  She is a duck now. 
[02:42:00]  She...  She...  And she couldn't even talk.  She's trying to...  Her lines, and they're coming out like this.  Like a...  Her mouth is paralyzed.  She couldn't speak.  She's like...  What?  Do these women think that looks good?  Well, they're trying to make you look like a swollen pussy.  We get it.  I would gather...  But it doesn't look good on all the ladies out there.  Like good plastic surgery, you just don't know the people that have had it done.  So, perhaps there are girls with collagen lips that you just walk by and think,  Oh, that's a pretty girl.  Yeah.  But I have not seen many like that. 
[02:42:30]  I don't think I have anyway.  You see big duck build, and the porn stars overdo it like they do everything else.  Their tits, their fucking ass, their lips, the makeup.  They just are disgusting, Steve.  No, I was reading an article recently.  They said high def is ruining a lot of pornos.  Yeah, well...  Because now you can see the pimples on the ass in high def.  You can see the scars.  You can see the stretch marks.  You can see the cellulite.  The same way high def is fucking up the news, and a lot of network television is fucking 
[02:43:00]  up the porn, because all of a sudden, you're seeing all of the imperfections and pockmarks  on the...  Don't fucking film it in high def.  Yeah.  What are they, crazy?  What are you looking at?  Wow, I really enjoy the lines of resolution on this.  You can really see the cum flying into her face.  It's almost like I'm there.  It makes it more appealing to me, really.  You want to see regular...  Well, I enjoy the reality of whatever bump might be there.  Mm-hmm.  I enjoy regular porno, like regular people porno, aside from like the stripper with the 
[02:43:30]  fake tits, and the guy, the huge cock, he's fucking for eight hours straight.  I'll tell you this Asian video I saw that I jerked off to, where I got this new thing  where I enjoy women doing, like, sex stuff, but it's very non-sexual, and I saw this song, 
[02:44:00]  two Asian girls, they were just squirting each other with each other's titty milk, you  know?  And they weren't going, ooh, titty milk.  One would squirt the other one in the face.  Like sorority sisters goofing around.  One would squirt, they were in the bathtub, and one would squirt one in the face, and the  milk would get in her mouth, and she would taste it and go, hey, and then the other  one would squirt the other one in the face, and she would go, hey, and it was just so  creepy, but it just, I couldn't stop jerking off to it, because it was just... 
[02:44:30]  Jack into it.  Because it was so creepy, and just two girls, like, just being dirty and creepy, and that,  so this high-def talk here, it's not turning me off, you know what I mean?  But I think, again, bringing back the racial shit, white guys are very into the perfect,  that perfect, quote-unquote, ten thing you got going with the size two and shit.  I'd rather have girl-next-door shit.  Like, I remember when I would get, like, Hustler, I think it was.  Yeah, nothing beats...  Who did the beaver hunt? 
[02:45:00]  Uh, I want to say Hustler.  Yeah, I think it was Hustler.  Yeah.  I would crank it to the beaver hunt.  Nothing beats girl-next-door stuff.  And girl-next-door, things like that, they'd have those sections.  And then you'd look at the models that they had for the magazine, and I'd be like,  all right, they're all right and stuff, but I'd go right to the beaver hunt,  just find, like, girl-next-door thing, crank away.  Because it's the reality of it.  Shouldn't it be next door?  It's attainable beauty, and that's what...  Door.  I said next door.  I said next door?  You did, too. 
[02:45:30]  It's next door, I guess, whatever.  I've corrected finger.  Fuck yourselves.  All right, hey, we got the clip.  Where the Grr clip came from.  This is from last year's Porn Awards.  Hi, I'm Jim.  Hi, Jim.  How are you doing?  Tiger.  Hi, Tiger.  And this is Steve.  Pleasure to meet you, Steve.  Hey, how are you, man?  Let me ask you a question.  Yes, sir.  I've been taking a poll.  This gentleman, I'm just standing here, would he do well in the adult industry?  People tell him that he should get into films and he's too shy.  Do you think he would do okay? 
[02:46:00]  We've got to check things out first.  Go ahead.  Show us a little something.  His face.  Do you think that his face is good for adult films?  Very handsome gentleman.  Do you think so?  Beautiful eyes.  What?  Thank you.  Oh, he's got this.  A mustache.  He has beautiful eyes?  Yeah.  What market do you think he would do well in?  Like, what niche would he fit?  Is there like a...  Bear.  Can you please say that again?  Bear.  Bear.  You'd be a bear.  Arr.  Yeah, great. 
[02:46:30]  See, he doesn't think he has bear qualities, but everyone tells him the same thing.  You're like the third person to tell him that.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Bear cow.  We'll bring out the bear in you.  And there's where that comes from.  That's the famous grr.  That's where it was born.  Grr.  I was feeling pretty good up until about five seconds ago.  So, hotmovies.com, Steve?  Yeah, hotmovies.com.  Really, really hooked me up for this one.  First class all the way out in the room is great at Mandalay. 
[02:47:00]  And I'm going to hit the expo later on and get more of that wonderful audio.  Has Jimmy been turned down for any photos yet or anything happened?  Any drama?  Any Jimmy stories?  No, no.  Jimmy flies out.  Jimmy's actually on a plane right now.  Oh, okay.  And I'll be hooking up with him in a little bit.  And I'm sure there will be plenty because there's supposed to be a lot more celebrities,  like, you know, regular celebrities at this AVN show.  All right.  It was pretty good.  Kenny was pointing out all the locations that Jimmy got turned down for a photo at. 
[02:47:30]  We saw the actual Gene Simmons location outside that men's room.  We saw the Gene Simmons.  It was like, ooh, that's where it happened.  That's like a famous spot now.  In Oakland Anthony land.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, Gene's going to be here this year.  And I'm very curious.  Is he?  And knows who the hell we are.  Who gives a shit?  I know you don't.  Hey, Steve, before we let you go, any news?  Anything you want to talk about?  No.  All right.  No. 
[02:48:00]  A little gossip.  A little chat.  Razzle-dazzle.  Oh, shit.  No.  All right.  No.  No.  Maybe later on.  This is uncomfortable.  I love it.  What?  Oh, it's just uncomfortable.  Wait, what was he saying?  Maybe what?  Maybe later on today I'll have some.  All right.  What are you doing in my house?  What are you doing in my house?  We're just hearing things.  What are you doing in my house? 
[02:48:30]  We're hearing things.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  No.  Nothing's wrong.  Just stay in the living room.  I'll handle it.  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house.  We're just hearing things.  Why not?  Get the fuck out.  Now.  Get the fuck out.  Now.  A message for Whackbag.  And go.  Grr.  And go.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Who's going to start it?  And go.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:49:00]  Nothing at all, huh, Steve?  No.  What are you doing in my house?  Get the fuck out.  Now.  You've got to play the CSI after that, though.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Not on the same thing.  That's too bad.  That would have been the thing to do.  That's all right.  Just imagine.  What?  Oh, I thought that was done.  Did Steve hang up?  Steve?  Oh, no. 
[02:49:30]  I'm panicking.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  It's Steve's story, man.  Nothing.  Nothing.  We're just hearing things.  I asked and he said...  One of these days, we'll just hear, um, I don't know, a story.  I just want to hear a story.  Yeah.  The beauty of this show...  One of these days, it might just be story time.  The beauty of the show, in the end, uh, everything is revealed. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  Sometimes it takes time.  Sometimes it's not a quick, yes, I do want to say something.  Yeah.  Sometimes it takes a little while.  Exactly.  It keeps you listening longer.  Yep.  Some creepy...  Unless you listen up for FM.  What?  Some creepy...  Yeah, he just hung up.  That is really fucked up right there.  I'm going to...  There was a lot of...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I think we're going to get fired off a nice email.  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  Let's go to Shwuggy.  Shwuggy! 
[02:50:30]  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Love the voice every single time.  It makes me think of Ann's bit.  I know you're not...  I know you're not 7'8 in the 6th grade, but you have the voice of one of those guys.  Oh, pituitary gland, Nick?  Oh.  Yeah, and if you're like the girls next door type look, you got to check out this one chick.  Sunny Lane.  When I was, uh...  I wish I could do the bit, because it's one of my favorites, but...  Oh, come on.  Sunny Lane.  Sunny Lane.  Yeah, Ann would love Sunny Lane. 
[02:51:00]  What's that about, Shwug?  Just a typical girl next door who's in porn.  Nothing whatsoever fake about her.  Sunny Lane.  Get her on the show.  She is a good girl, as Norton would say.  Was that the one that was related to Sunset Thomas?  No.  No.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Just trust me.  Look it up.  All right.  Later, boys.  All right, later.  I will look it up.  Let's go to Eric in Nebraska as Anthony Googles.  Sunny Lane.  Eric.  How's it going?  What's up? 
[02:51:30]  I just thought I'd help throw Steve under the bus.  You ought to play the promo for the money snatch he was doing before Christmas.  I think it's worse than the one you just played a little while ago.  It is worse?  You want to go there, Ann?  I think we made our point with the other one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Sunny Lane's very girl next door-ish.  Bit on the chubby side.  She looked...  Really?  I think she's got a little...  Which one are you looking at?  Well, the picture that Than threw up when she was bent over there.  The bent over one? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  She could lose about five pounds.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't notice.  Look at Patrice is shaking his head.  Oh, there's a nice shot.  All right.  Oh, she does the Hitler mustache and spreads her legs, though.  Ladies, Hitler mustache is fine, as long as you're keeping your legs together.  The second you spread them apart, it looks like a big thing of weeds that aren't supposed  to be there, because everything else is fleshy, and then about an inch or so above anything 
[02:52:30]  is just this tuft of hair that doesn't make any sense.  All right.  Stop it.  You know, Steve has no choice.  He has to call back, because he's sponsored by HotMovies.com.  HotMovies.com.  So he'll be calling back either later today or tomorrow, certainly.  Oh, little gossip, little chat.  Razzle jazzle. 
[02:53:00]  He hung up, though.  That's what's funny.  Yeah, he hung up.  He never has done that before.  Steve has never done that.  You're right.  He went into a Humana, Humana, Humana mode.  I don't know, Mr. Marshall.  Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana, Humana.  All right.  We'll do this, and then we'll come back and do something else.  How about a little variety?  Greg Hughes and Anthony Cumia have announced, we hate women, and we butt-sex each other.  No, we shouldn't be doing that. 
[02:53:30]  I'm going to be an Anthony show.  What's going on?  One of you guys can eat my ass right now.  It's fantastic.  You too.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Music's a little loud, Bill.  Work on the mix just a little bit for us.  That's all right.  We're tweaking, Ann.  Remember, we're tweaking everything.  Tweak here.  A little tweak there.  Where's E-Rock?  Why are you running out of the studio?  All right. 
[02:54:00]  E to the R.  Travis ran in all excited.  Fans whispering to me during the break.  Sam's got his camera.  Got his camera, and he's giggling about something, which means somebody is ready to get fucking chastised.  And to be honest, you and I, we forgot.  What?  But these guys behind the scenes did not forget.  What?  Exactly.  The story goes like this.  We took about, what, a month and a half off for Christmas.  And when we got back, we noticed that E-Rock gained a few LBs.  Oh, true. 
[02:54:30]  A few LBs.  And it turned out, we figured out he was gaining about a pound a day while we were off the air.  Yeah.  It's true.  You said 15 pounds, right?  Yeah, since like the middle of December.  So 15 pounds, and honestly, we were off about 15 days.  So it was a pound a day he gained over the Christmas holiday.  Jimmy had a great line.  He asked him if he had eaten a throw pillow sandwich.  Patrice, you notice that he looks heavier.  No.  Look around the bottom of his neck, like his neck, where his neck meets his chin.  He's lifting his chin up a lot higher. 
[02:55:00]  He always was a mushy looking kid to me, though.  Yeah, but there was one point, maybe it was a day, that he wasn't a...  No, he was thinner than that.  And you have some new relationship or something, right?  So that gets you fat.  You're all comfortable.  I saw him shopping in like Target.  He's too early in the relationship to get comfortable.  You don't fall apart.  You don't fall apart that quick.  He should be at the gym every day doing Taibo or something.  No, he's not.  He's happy.  He's fucking happy.  And I saw her. 
[02:55:30]  She's the type that'll make you gain weight so that no one else likes you.  She's a good cook, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  She's doing it on purpose, absolutely.  Oh, really?  Because E-Rock is...  Considering you got to understand that women are as shallow as we are, they do love you  for who you are and what you do.  So he is a big part of this show.  Yeah, I'll never quite understand that.  So she doesn't want anybody else wanting him.  So now he's just a big, fat, titty face.  Oh, fuck.  Jesus.  Double chin bitch.  Look at you, man. 
[02:56:00]  Come on, E-Rock.  Get your shit together, nigga.  Don't let these people sit around and berate you because you're sitting there swelling up  in love.  Well, he's swelling up in love.  Here's the problem.  He's not supposed to be a fat guy.  No.  You know what he's shaped like?  He was supposed to be a fat guy.  But not the kind you we draw, the actual heart that's in your chest.  An actual heart.  He's shaped like an actual medical heart now.  Some type of organ.  He's shaped like a kidney.  A gallbladder.  E-Rock is like a gallbladder.  That's because you're in love, man. 
[02:56:30]  Stop.  That's all I'm going to say to you.  I'm not going to sit there and fucking give you pointless, non-directional chastising.  And I'm going to tell you why you're fat and why you should stop.  You understand what I'm saying?  Get your shit together.  She wants you to not be sexy for anybody else, E-Rock.  She found you sexy, saw something in you, and she's going to try to cultivate that thing  she sees in you.  But why she's looking at you, the outside of you, is turning into something bad.  What are you eating or what did you eat that made you gain weight? 
[02:57:00]  A lot of steak.  Steak.  Steak don't make you gain weight.  How about the bread that's on the steak?  Yes, it does.  It's dessert and stuff, bro.  Yeah, steak doesn't make you gain weight.  If you're just eating steak, you're not going to gain 15 pounds.  No, but it's steak, it's potatoes.  It's one of those, I don't know.  All steak is, what's that diet?  Joe Blow's, South Beach, Atkins, Slash.  Protein doesn't make you gain your lion.  No.  I'm not a dessert person. 
[02:57:30]  I'm a big food person.  Okay, so what's going on?  It's what you're eating with the steak.  It's what's on the steak.  And let me tell you something.  Potato cheese, is it butter?  There's something on the steak.  No, let me tell you fucking Atkins people something.  But there's a lot of potatoes, too.  It doesn't matter.  If you eat a fucking giant Fred Flintstone tip your car over fucking steak and sit on your ass,  you're going to get fat.  I don't give a fuck what Atkins says.  That is true, yeah.  Because it does come down to calories.  It's not true.  You're giving wrong information.  Are you insane? 
[02:58:00]  Dude, it all does come down to calories.  You could eat vegetables to the point you're going to get fat.  Why would you lie to people like that?  Get it.  Holy shit, how much money?  What do you got?  What do you want to say?  What do you got?  You're not going to gain weight just eating vegetables and sit around.  Dude, you eat enough of anything, you're going to gain weight.  Yes.  I'm going to tell you why you're not going to gain weight with the beef.  It comes down to the total calories.  Okay, with the beef.  I'll tell you why.  All right.  Okay.  First of all, what makes you gain weight is hunger, when you're hungry. 
[02:58:30]  This is why the Atkins diet work.  That's why I work weight-wise, but health-wise, you can die.  But what happens is the protein doesn't fuck with your pancreas.  It doesn't create sugar.  It breaks down very slowly.  That's why you're not as hungry.  This is why he's eating something else.  When you eat starch, it goes to your insulin, your pancreas.  It makes a bunch of fucking insulin, and it shoots a crazy load of insulin, and you get fucking tired. 
[02:59:00]  So you get hungry again.  He's been eating bread.  He's been eating rice.  He's been eating potatoes.  Look, he's nodding.  Yes!  Bread's not steak, E-Rock.  We ask you what you're eating.  Yeah, but that's one of the big things with steak all the time.  But I don't eat, like, I eat a lot of food, but not, like, a huge meal at one time.  Why are you lying, E-Rock?  I'm trying to be on your side.  They just want to call you a fat fuck for an hour.  I'm trying to help you.  You're lying.  You're in bread. 
[02:59:30]  I need a dietician, because I'm not accepting what you're saying.  I'm not either.  You can just gain weight from eating beef.  If you're not doing anything, yes.  If you ate one of those big plates of fucking food.  Not 15 pounds in 15 fucking days.  He's eating potato sandwiches.  But that, yes.  Yes.  You're 100% right.  But you could gain weight by eating healthy, if you're eating too much.  I'm telling you.  How would you even say something like that?  Holy shit, get a doctor on the fucking phone. 
[03:00:00]  I don't want one of these lying-ass ONA doctors who'll just say,  yes, you can gain weight from eating air.  Fuck that.  You can't gain weight from just eating broccoli all day and not move.  You're not going to gain weight.  You eat broccoli all day long.  You're not going to gain weight in the end?  No.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Get a diet.  Your holy shit means nothing to me.  Look, you eat apple pie all day, you're going to gain the weight faster. 
[03:00:30]  But if you're eating broccoli all day long, day after day, you're going to gain weight.  Because you're overeating.  Yes.  I'm looking at Big Kevin.  He's the barometer.  Like, yes, yes.  People have the misconception you eat healthy.  It doesn't matter how much of the healthy stuff you're eating, you're not going to gain weight.  That's bullshit.  You still got to, like, not eat a ton.  You still have to move. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, exercises.  Dude, I'm no dietician.  It's about the portions.  I want a doctor.  Here's a doctor.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Kathy in Virginia.  Kathy?  Yes.  What are your credentials, Kathy?  I have a PhD in endocrinology.  I'm a registered dietician.  Endocrinology.  And I have a PhD in exercise physiology.  All right.  Right there is exactly what we need.  What's your website?  We have to look at it right now.  No.  Endocrinology.  Okay.  I'll go with it. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  And we can get a second opinion, you know.  All right.  All right.  We can get a third opinion.  I don't care.  Kathy, you've been listening to this discussion?  Yes.  All right.  What is your professional opinion?  I'm getting so mad at Patrice because he is wrong.  Absolutely.  It's all about calories.  If you take in more calories than you expend, you will gain weight.  It doesn't matter if the calories come from broccoli, from bread, from steak.  Absolutely.  If you take in more calories.  But the fact that it remains, you would have to eat a shitload of broccoli.  That's.  There you go.  All right.  Preface it with that. 
[03:02:00]  But it is possible.  You have to eat gain weight amount of broccoli.  How much fucking?  It's a tree full of broccoli.  You have to fucking eat to gain it.  Stop.  Stop.  Just.  That's why people don't gain weight when making healthy diets.  Because you're not going to eat 2,000 calories worth of broccoli.  Why wouldn't you say that first instead of?  I'm so mad at you, Patrice.  When you add that you eat two steaks, you will gain the weight.  You have to eat an entire forest full of carrots for you to fucking gain weight eating vegetables. 
[03:02:30]  But it's possible.  Because the initial thing that was brought up was steak.  And the fact is, if you eat a lot of steak, which is a lot different than broccoli, you're going to pack on some pounds.  But don't you get ketosis, ma'am, from eating?  No, ketosis, ketosis.  Doesn't your body eat your own fat when you eat that kind of shit?  No, no, no, no, no.  Your body prefers carbohydrates.  So if you totally deny your body of carbohydrates, then you can go into ketosis, which happens with diabetics. 
[03:03:00]  Because they're not producing insulin and they're not using insulin correctly.  So then the body can only use fat for fuel, so then you go into a state of ketosis.  So what the Atkins diet is touting, which is not true, is that if you limit or completely deny your body of carbohydrates,  then the body is going to be forced to use fat, which will then use the stored fat that you have as fuel, which makes you lose weight. 
[03:03:30]  Exactly.  Now, why is that bad?  Why is that bad?  Because the central nervous system, for instance, your heart, a lot of the organs in your body can only use carbohydrate for fuel.  So the body is then forced to go through a process called gluconeogenesis, where it takes non-glucose products and makes glucose out of them.  And that's really, really hard on the body.  Like what, for instance?  It slows down your metabolism.  So that's why people who go on these fat diets... 
[03:04:00]  You're kind of alchemists inside your body.  That's amazing.  They lose weight initially, but then they don't keep it off.  Does your body know how to...  Because your body slows down the metabolism.  ...rape itself for a certain thing.  So what would Eric...  What would it take for him in 15 days to gain 15 pounds from...  How much meat did he have to eat?  He's eating too many calories, and he's not...  Like Anthony said, he's not doing any exercise.  And, you know, he doesn't want to admit it, but he ate a lot of dessert during the holiday.  It's much cooler to say, oh, I ate a lot of steak. 
[03:04:30]  No.  Yeah.  You don't have any of Mommy's desserts during the holiday.  No, I'm not a dessert person.  But not only is there steak, there's cold cuts and, like, chopped meat and other stuff there, too.  I mean, he's even just alcohol.  He's not a dessert person, but he's certainly deserted.  Excuse me.  He's certainly deserted exercise.  Hey, Opie, would you say this could be...  Make me laugh, you fuck.  Would you say this could actually be a groundbreaking moment if we can get an endocrinologist... 
[03:05:00]  It'd be groundbreaking if Iraq jumps up and down.  That's what I'm going to say.  Can you please, ma'am, could you just please call Iraq a fat fuck?  Just I want to hear a medical person.  Could you say, Iraq, stop eating steak or are you going to be just a fat fuck?  Please, could you do that?  I can't do that.  She's a professional.  You're a fucking dietitian, not a politician.  Say, Iraq, you're fucking fat. 
[03:05:30]  Just do this.  Just don't eat as much or just move more.  You fat fuck, right?  Say you fat fuck.  Or you're going to be a fat fuck.  Absolutely.  It's time to start eating water.  All right, Iraq's been moving to the refrigerator.  Listen, let's say hi to John in Jersey.  John, what's up?  Hey, I just want to say, Iraq, you got a fat guy telling you you're fat.  Listen up. 
[03:06:00]  Frankas!  There you go.  Not the Frankas.  All right, anyway, we forgot about the little thing.  We said we were going to weigh Iraq every day until he loses the 15 pounds he gained over the holiday.  Yeah, and if he puts on a pound, we get to what?  Chubby Bunny.  Punch him in the face.  Do we have marshmallows?  He's got to do Chubby Bunny.  He has to do Chubby Bunny.  Which would be worse because then, you know, even if you don't eat the marshmallow, the sugar and saliva dissolving goes down and you put on some weight that way.  Well, we forgot. 
[03:06:30]  We thought, ha ha, funny for the radio, whatever, we'll move on.  But these guys did not move on.  I wonder why the rest of the staff didn't forget about putting Iraq through hell.  There were emails going back and forth, wagers.  Remember that $50 you ripped up the other day?  Yeah.  It's part of the contest that they have behind the scenes.  I know.  I thought it was going to be for a nice lunch for the boys, and they decided to wager it on Iraq, knowing he would be a complete failure.  Dad, what's going on?  Yeah, we each picked a weight, and whoever's closest to Eric's actual weight wins the $50 from him. 
[03:07:00]  Nice.  We got the scale.  Well, so, Iraq, how much did you weigh before the holidays?  Probably around 200.  19.  No, before the holidays.  No, but you dope.  He was trying to help you out.  You just fucked yourself.  That means you gained 19 pounds during the holidays.  Yeah.  You ass.  You jumped and said, no.  So, if you weighed 200 pounds before the holidays, we did weigh you as soon as you got back, and we got a weight of 219. 
[03:07:30]  You fat fuck.  So, you are now admitting that it's closer to 20 pounds than the 15 we gave you.  So, that seems a little bit, a little bit much.  Excessive.  Well, now we're talking over a pound a day you were gaining while we're all on vacation.  You tub-a-lard motherfucker.  What is all the fat?  All right.  You big, fat fuck.  This is funny just to say that. 
[03:08:00]  Could you take the mic out of the hot dog bun and you just weighed?  And we know 219 is not fat.  It's just that he doesn't look like he should be fat.  Well, he's only 4 foot 10.  219 pounds.  All right.  So, Iraq, you seem to have more upper body fat content than lower.  Is that it?  Am I seeing something there?  It's all distributed in his face. 
[03:08:30]  Like, you got a double chin starting.  Like, when you lift your head up, it goes away.  He looks like typical fat guy.  But when you put your head down, it's so there.  He looks like typical fat guy where, you know, they wear shorts, they got the skinny legs,  but everything else is fat on them.  Right.  Yeah, I agree with you.  I agree with you, Greg.  Like Pat.  Pat Fominaki.  Pat Fominaki's got these skinny legs.  He's got skinnier ankles than I.  A fucking globe.  Yeah, he's like the Grimace. 
[03:09:00]  All right.  He's like a fucking golf ball on two T's.  So, Iraq, you want to get on the scale?  All right.  All right.  So, it was 219 before we took another three days off.  You need help lifting your leg there, butterball?  Look at Danny's jumping in excitement.  All right.  Danny, get the official weight.  Dan's got his arms up in the air.  Shit.  What?  It's 219.  He didn't.  Holy shit.  You didn't lose anything. 
[03:09:30]  All eyes are on you and you couldn't lose a fucking pound.  You knew we've been ragging you for a fucking week on this.  Dude, if I'm you and this guy takes more abuse on this show than anyone.  I couldn't even tell you who's in second place as far as getting beat up on this show.  You would think we took the long weekend, like five, six days between the last time we talked to our fine fans here.  That he'd lose something.  You would think just for the hell of it you'd lose a pound to get these guys off your back.  What happened? 
[03:10:00]  Same weight doesn't get these guys off your back.  Did you honestly try anything?  Your weight says absolutely not.  You didn't do shit different than you've been doing.  Did you try eating less of something?  Yeah.  Did you do what?  No beef but chicken.  Uh-huh.  Switch to that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chicken.  Chicken wings?  Chicken.  No.  Entire chickens.  Buffalo chicken wings?  A chicken stuffed inside of what? 
[03:10:30]  A turd ducking.  A turd ducking.  What did you stuff the chicken inside of?  Nothing.  What did you season it with?  Apple pies?  Apple pies.  I wish.  I wish, but he would never be honest.  I wish he would write down everything he eats and bring it in.  He's not going to be honest because he did not.  First of all, he walks around enough to not have gained 20 pounds.  He walks around enough.  He walks here.  He walks outside to not have gained weight just by eating some fucking chicken. 
[03:11:00]  I know.  I'm a fat guy.  Chicken.  I've been dealing with fat from the rest of my life.  I know that you've been eating wrong, Eric.  What have you been eating?  Pasta?  What's your girl cook?  Rice?  Um.  Biscuits?  A lot of meat, rice.  Condiments.  A lot of mayo.  A lot of condiments.  I'm serious.  He likes mayo.  What do you drink with it?  A mayonnaise.  With your dinner and stuff.  Diet soda.  Diet soda.  Diet Coke.  What flavor shake do we have, sir?  Oh, shit.  Ketchup. 
[03:11:30]  Ketchup shake.  Give me a barbecue shake.  Uh, like a chicken with some cannolis in his beak.  Danny just walked out.  With a chicken carrying fucking cannolis.  Oh, hold on.  He eats the feathers, too.  It has a lot of starch in it.  Hold on.  A little observation.  Danny just walked out punching the wall in disgust.  He was pissed.  Why are you pissed, Danny?  I won.  What did you have?  Yeah, well, I lost 50 bucks.  What did you have?  I had 215.  Oh, you assumed he'd lose. 
[03:12:00]  Well, I thought he would be conscious of his weight because of the beating he took last  week, and he would actually make a conscious effort to not eat like a pig, and I figured  maybe, you know, he took a nice dump since he ate like a pig, and, you know, it's not  that hard to get rid of four pounds.  I think what we've learned here is humiliation does not burn one calorie.  Right.  Not a fucking one.  Here's the deal.  We will weigh E-Rock on Monday.  Anyway, I need the pass to remind us to weigh E-Rock, because we're going to forget.  E-Rock.  I have faith in E-Rock, man.  I have faith in E-Dude. 
[03:12:30]  Do you think you're going to be able to lose any weight over the weekend?  Yeah.  I think I can do that.  Yeah.  They're all shaking their head.  Here's what I'm going to do.  I had a pretty good time in Vegas.  I did very well.  I am putting up...  Holy shit.  Look at that back roll.  No, no.  I'm putting up 100.  Whoa.  So now all you guys, again, do the same fucking bet based on this fucking slouch that can't 
[03:13:00]  lose...  Who's got fucking 219?  Because I would pick 2 fucking 19.  Someone ought to have to pick numbers out so you can pick what weight and pick 219, because  I don't see him losing a pound.  I say they have to pick the weight out of a hat.  There it is.  I have faith in him.  Pick the weight out of a hat.  They'll figure it out behind the scenes.  However you...  But I have spiritual faith and I have money faith.  Wait a minute.  $100.  I mean, it's tough to lose a lot of weight in three or four days.  You want to give it a week. 
[03:13:30]  But whatever...  However they want to work...  One week from today.  One week from today.  They lord of the flied the fucking thing out themselves anyway.  So however they want to arrange it is fine by me.  I say a week.  It's a week.  A week from today.  Next Thursday.  By next Thursday.  Because that gives a little time.  I would still pick 219.  Yeah.  I can't see you losing weight.  $100 up for grabs.  There's nothing in it for you.  For one of the guys.  We weigh you in a week.  We'll find more things to humiliate you with.  There won't be anything in it for you. 
[03:14:00]  Guys, I lost some weight.  Yeah, but you're still stupid.  That's like what this place is all about.  And a little incentive.  If you don't lose anything by next Thursday, you have to walk around with a sign that says,  I'm a fat fuck.  Holy shit.  On Friday.  On Friday.  All day at CBS.  A sandwich board sign.  All day at 3FM and during the walkover.  During the walkover.  Are you going to agree to that?  Yeah, I agree to it.  All right.  How about a big sandwich board.  I'm a fat fuck.  And for the walkover, we make up flyers with pictures of him with I'm a fat fuck. 
[03:14:30]  And he's got to hand them out to people.  And knowing these guys, there's going to be a lot of candy and shit later on.  Oh, I know.  They're just going to tempt him and taunt him.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Well, all the best, D-Rock.  And I really hope that you can.  And not so much for the bit.  But you're a young guy. 
[03:15:00]  Just for your health.  For the love of God.  Yeah.  What do you...  Danny, what do you got?  What does Danny have?  Marshmallows.  Oh, marshmallows.  Marshmallows are tasty.  Well, he didn't lose any weight, so he's got to do Chubby Bunny.  That was the bet.  Oh, no.  That was the bet.  Oh, no.  Let's go to break.  Hold on, Lauren.  I gained five pounds just from doing this.  All right.  Here.  Open up the marshmallows.  Have you seen Chubby Bunny yet?  No, sir.  What are you doing?  All right.  Get a garbage pail.  We read a story while we were in West Palm Beach.  Some lady was doing a Chubby Bunny contest. 
[03:15:30]  I guess these are very popular at the state fairs and stuff.  And a lady at a state fair, she was doing the Chubby Bunny contest.  Like, the Girl Scouts do it, things like that.  Okay.  To kill time.  One of these goofy things when they're having their little pajama parties.  And basically what you do is you put a marshmallow in your mouth and say Chubby Bunny.  And after you say Chubby Bunny, you put another marshmallow in your mouth and say Chubby Bunny.  And you see how many you can do before you have to, like, pretty much gag or puke up the marshmallows.  And then whoever did the most wins the little blue ribbon at the state fair. 
[03:16:00]  Marshmallows are good.  Chubby Bunny.  Uh-oh.  Oh, you want to do it?  Don't chew.  Oh, you're just moving it?  Chubby Bunny.  What's the record?  What's the show record?  17, Craig.  17's the record.  Chubby Bunny.  Is that three?  That's three.  Wow.  And that's nothing.  It's nothing. 
[03:16:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Oh, my God.  That's four.  Chubby Bunny.  Big A had a real problem at that point.  She just has those fucking Dizzy Gillespie cheeks.  No kidding, man.  You're fucking...  Oh, he's putting...  Chubby Bunny.  Now he looks like a fighter with a mouthpiece in.  I'm like...  Leon Sphinx.  Looks like Leon Sphinx teeth.  Chubby Bunny.  Chubby Bunny.  All right, there you go.  Big old choppers that he had. 
[03:17:00]  What?  Who's counting?  That's seven.  This comes...  This is eight, I believe.  This is nine.  Nine?  Nine.  He'll break the record.  I don't think so.  I think he will.  Chubby Bunny.  I never thought Patrice would do this.  Chubby Bunny.  That's ten.  Chubby Bunny.  Wow.  I like his technique, by the way.  Keeping the mouth open. 
[03:17:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Oh, my God.  It does before he lost it.  Couldn't do it.  God damn it.  Shit.  Shit.  I don't even know why I started doing it.  It just seemed interesting, right?  See how many you can do.  Holy shit.  I don't want to go at that again.  You've got a lot of confidence, too. 
[03:18:00]  It catches up on you.  They are delicious.  All right.  Iraq, your punishment for not gaining...  For not losing any weight is...  You have to do the Chubby Bunny going into break here.  Here's you.  He's placing.  Chubby Bunny.  One.  Got to get him a bunny suit, too.  Chubby Bunny.  Two.  Christmas story.  Yeah.  Chubby.  Funny.  Yeah.  Chubby Bunny.  Three. 
[03:18:30]  Chubby Bunny.  Four.  We should make him just do fat fuck.  Chubby Bunny.  Five.  Yeah, let's do fat fuck from now on.  Fat fuck.  Much funnier, Ant.  Fat fuck.  Seven.  This is not right.  Is this eight?  Yeah.  Four.  Four. 
[03:19:00]  Much funnier.  Four.  Four.  That's not right.  Look at him go.  Go ahead, Iraq.  Don't choke.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  This is so dangerous, man.  Ten.  Here's eleven.  Oh, you can hear it mushing.  Four.  Four.  I think I have more than eleven in my mouth.  It's got to be Iraq. 
[03:19:30]  What are we up to, then?  Twelve?  Yeah, that's more than twelve.  There's twelve.  Four.  Four.  Wow, he's good.  Do your thing, buddy.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Four.  Hold on, though.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Don't move.  What?  Make him say chubby bunny, because fat fuck might be an easier thing to say than chubby bunny.  I know, but this is just a...  We don't care about... 
[03:20:00]  Oh, okay.  This is more about...  We want to make sure that he can...  He's doing it.  Fifteen going in.  Oh, my God.  Do not choke.  Go ahead, Iraq.  Four.  Four.  He's still going.  How many got to beat?  Three more to beat the record?  This is sixteen going in.  Next one ties.  Oh, shit.  Big Kev's on it.  Uh-oh.  He's gagging a little.  It's a little drool.  A little drool, a little choking going on.  This is a tie right here. 
[03:20:30]  Wow.  This ties the Opie and Anthony record that Craig set.  He looks like Big A right now.  All right.  Is this for the record, Big Kev?  This is.  This is for the record.  He's turning red.  There's definitely some problems going on.  Holy shit.  There you go.  There you go.  That's what's stuffing him.  Wow. 
[03:21:00]  I bet you beat the record.  Wow.  Nineteen going in.  Nineteen going in.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's gagging.  He's gagging.  Holy shit.  Twenty.  This is an even twenty, E-Rock.  Is him just grunting?  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Come on, E-Rock.  Grunting is enough.  It's not about what you're saying. 
[03:21:30]  It's how many you can get in your mouth.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  He's fuking.  There he goes.  Oh, God.  Jesus.  There he goes.  It's just how many you can get in your mouth is the point.  It's more the point than saying Chubby Bunny, I guess, yeah.  Twenty.  Twenty.  I can beat that.  As long as you're saying noise.  You did twelve or eleven.  But I'm saying I thought it was all about saying something.  Well, you still got to say something.  He was saying something the whole time.  All right, we got to take a break. 
[03:22:00]  Maybe we can try again after the break.  Fuck.  All right.  Unpredictable, unleashed, unruly.  Unwashed, unkempt.  I stink.  Best thing I knew, I had my pants down around my knees and my shirt pulled up to my armpits.  Shut up.  No, who cares?  I can't believe you fell for that again.  Damn you, Hawk.  We're back. 
[03:22:30]  Talking about Man vs. Wild.  Patrice turned me on to the fact that there was a better show called Survivor Man.  Much better.  And then someone from PalTalk, because they were listening in during the break, they told  me that it's on the Science Channel or something like that.  So I'm going to go try to find that, because I love Man vs. Wild.  It used to be more prevalent.  You used to bump into Survivor Man a lot more.  Like, I would turn and always see Survivor Man on the TV guy part of the cable. 
[03:23:00]  And I watched it a couple of times.  He was in the Canadian wilderness.  And evidently, it's fucked up in the Canadian wilderness.  I mean, he'd go out there and he's figuring out how to, you know, he's lighting fires,  of course, and doing all the caveman shit.  He's got to figure out what things to eat for protein.  He has to figure out what things, he's catching snails.  Yeah, the show's great.  Man vs. Wild, they just drop him in the wilderness somewhere, somewhere crazy.  Like, there's been a desert, there's been a volcano area, there's been, you know, the 
[03:23:30]  Alps, the mountains, all that shit.  I don't want to trash the guy, though.  And then he has to find a way out to civilization.  Survivor Man's the same thing.  He's got, like, five days or so.  Survivor Man is the same thing.  But Man vs. Wild, I'm not going to fucking talk that much shit about him, because even  if this was a movie, what he does requires a stuntman, you know?  It requires a professional to even do it if it was fake.  But I was talking to Patrice about Man vs. Wild, and he goes, that's nothing, because 
[03:24:00]  they sent a camera crew with Man vs. Wild, dude.  And that's the problem I had with the show, because all of a sudden they're talking about  this rock face or whatever that he has to get down or survive, and you're like, oh my  God, how is he going to do that?  And then it's time for Man vs. Wild, dude, to do it.  And there's the camera crew, because they got an angle from below as he's doing it, and  you're like, oh, fuck, man.  You're taking me out of this, because I know the camera people got down.  Yeah, they made it.  They made it.  It's not like one of those...  And they don't even have the skills of the other dude. 
[03:24:30]  It's not like a Spike Lee camera where they tie the camera to your chest as you're walking  and it seems like you're floating or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, they're like, he crawls up in a tree to overlook the jungle, and there's  a camera at the same level height in the tree with him on another fucking tree.  Yeah.  Well, he does have a handheld at times that he's holding out in front of him.  Not the one I saw when he was...  Not in another tree.  Yeah, not in another tree, where it's like...  And it's cinematography. 
[03:25:00]  It's done well.  Yeah, well, Man vs. Wild, they took Survivor Man and made a better quote for TV, because  Survivor Man, what you told me, I haven't seen it yet, it was just the dude with his  own camera.  And, you know, he would do things like, okay, it's raining, and then the camera would go  and you'd be like, oh, shit, this thing's going to die.  And then it'll come on tomorrow, where, like, I'm sorry, battery, and something happened.  And who knows, they could have flew in and gave him a new camera. 
[03:25:30]  Exactly.  But the cocksucker is giving off the thing, like, he's by himself, and the whole thing  is, if he doesn't meet them where they're supposed to meet at the end of the week, then  they come looking for him.  He's supposed to get to the highway at the end of the week.  But there's other people with him.  Survivor Man doesn't give the impression that other people with him.  So, Man vs. Wild, you can see at some point, somebody said, and cut.  It's very movie-like. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's very movie-like.  And what sucks with Man vs. Wild, he finds civilization every time, and it's supposed to  be in a five-day period, and it has a happy ending every time.  Someone on the Instant Feedback is telling me that there was one time they had a rescue  Survivor Man.  He's in deep shit!  See, that would be cool, because I'm a big fan of Man vs. Wild.  One damn time, he's like, ah, fuck, I can't figure this out.  Put him in enough shit where he needs help.  And then they show what happens if he can't figure shit out, because you know there's 
[03:26:30]  been a few scenarios where he couldn't figure out shit.  What does he do?  Does he have, like, a satellite phone or whatever?  Exactly, a very special cell phone episode of Man vs. Wild.  Like, I thought this river was going to lead to something, but instead it leads to a 500-foot  fucking waterfall.  I'm screwed.  Guess what, guys?  I got it.  I got it.  Send me on the chopper.  Where you at?  Uh, shit.  Jungle Street and Fire Ant Boulevard, nigga.  I don't know.  Come get me out of this bitch.  Yeah, to the chopper. 
[03:27:00]  I'm Survivor Man.  Survivor Man is, look, Man vs. Wild is more aesthetic.  It's better.  It's more aesthetically pleasing to watch.  The dude is better looking, like it's this young British Secret Service motherfucker.  Special Ops guy.  Special Ops guy.  Special Ops, yeah.  Where fucking Survivor Man looks like Danny, you know?  Little chump to him and stuff.  Yeah, a little short dude, and he's like official.  More regular dude.  You know, he's drinking the pints when he's not filming Survivor Man, right? 
[03:27:30]  He's a mess.  It's like, you know, he's just a messy little dude, and he has this camera, and you feel  like, shit, damn, shit.  But Man vs. Wild, you don't feel like, god damn.  I'm still impressed.  I like watching that show, because it's different, you know?  It's impressive for what it is.  And then the shit he figures out.  Like, he was in, uh, I forgot what location he was in, and he was screwed.  He needed food, and he's trying to catch fish, and he's like, ah, fuck, you know?  It's not working.  I saw that one.  And then he discovers or sees a plant that you and I would be like, yeah, it's a fucking plant. 
[03:28:00]  And he goes, oh my god, this is the plant the Indians used to use to catch fish.  And you're like, what?  So then he takes the leaves of the plant, and he mashes them down with a stupid rock, throws  it in a pool of water, and the fish instantly die.  It's like, how the fuck do you know that shit?  It's a poison to the fish.  The one I saw, he was in, like, uh, shit, Costa Rica, some jungle?  He caught, he ate, he drank the water from a river, and he ate some prey fish.  And, and then he got really sick.  He's like, oh, no shit. 
[03:28:30]  So he woke up in the morning, he goes, oh.  He climbs up two mountains to go to this tree where you go when you got an upset stomach.  Oh, yeah.  It was a milk tree.  He cut it, and he licked the tree, and he's like, oh, I gotta fucking lick the milk tree.  And it soothed his stomach.  He was sucking on the milk tree, and it turns out that's the same tree they use for whatever,  like Pepto or something.  Really?  Yeah, but he knows all this shit.  Oh, he cut the bark.  He's like, oh, better. 
[03:29:00]  His cramps went away.  Now, there's those big piles of shit around that tree, too.  Where people just had a, oh, lick the tree and take a big shit.  We had a dummy on the line.  He hung up.  He goes, man versus wild.  The camera crew's not, can't help him.  Can't help him.  You're trying to tell me.  So they'll just watch him die.  They'll watch him die for TV, right?  Shut up, you go.  We understand he can't give him a fucking tic-tac.  See, that's the scenario of the show, but if he gets into real danger, they're gonna just  film and go, well, we got some great tape when they get back to the States? 
[03:29:30]  No.  They're jumping in.  If he does a first blood fall, and he stabbed himself, and he's bleeding to death, he can't  say, hey, fellas, you know what?  Cancel this film and call the helicopter.  Yeah.  Get me the fuck out of here.  They're helping him.  I'm going to stitch myself up.  And they're not gonna air that episode, obviously.  Tiger's gnawing out his leg, and they're gonna be sitting there going, this is great footage.  I mean, I couldn't even film the movie version of it.  I mean, this guy, I'm not, you can't, for what he does. 
[03:30:00]  I mean, he's climbing up mountaintops with vines.  He's doing shit.  Yeah.  But I'm saying, it's not as dangerous, he's not really by himself, and he's, you know,  he's not doing the whole by himself thing.  Survivor Man is alone in the fucking wilderness, man.  Well, Patrice, I would love to have paid attention to what you said, but I couldn't get past Opie.  What'd I do?  Doing the camera, and actually cranking, you were doing a little pantomime of the camera 
[03:30:30]  crew, taping the guy, and you used your right hand, and you used your left hand to steady  a camera, and your right hand was cranking a crank.  W, W, W, W, W, E, Griffith, what his name?  What the fuck is that?  And now a newsreel from 1930.  How about some 40s music, Phil?  Oh, my God.  Cecil B. DeMille with his camera.  Cecil B. DeMille with his cameraman, Greg Opie Hughes, cranking the camera away.  The new production of Nosferatu will be coming out. 
[03:31:00]  Are you fucking with me?  I am not fucking with him.  I looked and just was like, he's cranking a camera.  In this day, and it's 2007, Opie still has a crank camera.  I can't disrespect the guy because of what he fucking does.  I mean, when you film a movie, motherfuckers got to go cut, and then there's a guy that  comes in and takes your place to do shit.  Right.  He's doing shit.  He's climbing up trees with vines.  He's starting fires.  He's doing...  Yeah, he's really doing this shit.  I mean, he's doing shit, but he's just not by himself, which is... 
[03:31:30]  By the way...  Any one of us would be dead in a day.  Greg from Jersey, they say he's climbing with vines, but you're going to be a  and see the ropes and harness on TiVo.  Really?  I don't know if that's true.  I'm going to look closely for that shit, though.  Hey, Patrick in Chicago is saying Survivor Man's a pussy.  Patrick?  Man, Survivor Man is such a pussy.  He's got, like, all these little cameras.  Like, he's trying to position them like he's trying to make his own little porno for YouTube.  And Man vs. Wild, man, he's like drinking the liquid out of elephant poop, man. 
[03:32:00]  This guy, he's like hardcore.  Yeah, he squeezes the elephant poop to get some refreshment.  Some liquid out of it.  Man, who drank the frickin' liquid out of elephant poop?  The guy's crazy.  And then I went like this to show that he was squeezing.  Yeah, I saw that.  Thank you, thank you.  That was accurate.  You know, he's got Survivor Man.  He's like, oh, he's just seeing his cameras.  Like, oh, is my button shot?  Oh, does this look good?  Does that look good?  Screw that guy.  And then he's always got some fake injury.  Oh, I broke my arm.  Oh, how am I going to get by with a broken arm?  What does he have?  What is he allowed to have besides the camera as far as... 
[03:32:30]  He's always got some prop.  He's always got, like, oh, this is my broke-down snowmobile, so he's got, like, gasoline.  So he's got, like, that...  How does he start a fire?  But this guy's not being fair, though.  Hold on, hold on.  He's got, like, a leftover battery.  In Man vs. Wild, the dude's got a knife.  That's all he got is a knife.  The Man vs. Wild dude's got a knife, and they give him a flint.  Sometimes.  Sometimes they give him a flint.  And other times you do watch him just start a fire.  Hold on, hold on.  He's misrepresenting, too, because the guy... 
[03:33:00]  Here's what Survivor Man does.  He reenacts as if this is how you would really get stuck in this situation.  So when this dude's telling you he has a snowmobile, he's riding this fucking snowmobile somewhere,  and he reenacts, wow, I broke down, how someone is going to...  This fucking Man vs. Wild guy, he puts on a cape, but he flies out of a plane into the fucking jungle.  Like, that's his purpose. 
[03:33:30]  Survivor Man kind of just ends up stuck somewhere.  Ends up stuck.  Like a fucking person.  Like a real person.  Hold on, let me add to that, too.  Yeah, Survivor Man, so it's something that could possibly happen.  You're on your snowmobile way in the wilderness.  You run out of gas or whatever.  You're like, holy shit, I'm fucked.  And then he's basically showing you, well, you know what, maybe you could use some parts of the snowmobile.  Like the fucking Chinese guy that went up when the family got stuck.  That's what Survivor Man does.  That Chinese guy where it's like, oh, my God, we took a wrong turn into Oregon Hills.  He walked up and took his clothes off. 
[03:34:00]  And I fucked up.  I really fucked up.  You know, the whole family didn't jump out of a plane into fucking the goddamn mountains.  A Man vs. Wild, like, he has a flint if he's in a snowy, you know, in snowy terrain,  because you're not going to find dry shit to start a fire.  But then if he's, like, on a desert island or whatever, then he doesn't get the flint,  because it's easier to start a fire.  Sticks.  Sticks and shit.  He doesn't get the stuff that maybe that Asian guy needed to save his fucking family, 
[03:34:30]  because it was snowy Oregon fucking wilderness.  Why'd he leave the car?  Where was his flint?  Why'd he leave the car?  Did he see Man vs. Wild dude among the icebergs in a rowboat?  No.  So he's in, I don't know, Alaska, right?  Icebergs, Alaska.  In the North Atlantic.  This is only a 12% trashing, only because I respect this fucking Man vs. Wild guy.  It's still a good show.  We're just picking it apart.  I'm being an asshole, logistically, a logistic asshole, but that guy is amazing, but it's 
[03:35:00]  like some shit you just go, come on, man.  Well, he's filming, well, my example, he's filming stuff to make good TV, obviously.  So he's in Alaska, he gets down to the water, and there's all the icebergs and floating  ice shit all over the place, and he realizes he has to cross this thing or whatever.  He happens to find a rowboat at an old hunting area that's now closed down, but there's a  rowboat there.  I'm sure that was there. 
[03:35:30]  So then he starts paddling, makes a homemade paddle, and he starts paddling through the  iceberg, saying how dangerous it is, and one of these icebergs could spring a leak in  this, and if it happens, I only have about two minutes in the water before I'm going  to die, right?  So it's like, holy shit, that's pretty fucked up.  He gets about 200 yards from shore, from where he'll be safe, and conveniently, the rowboat  is now filling up with water.  And I turned to Lindsey, I go, did he puncture a hole in the boat in the TV, obviously?  He built his own rat. 
[03:36:00]  Let me tell you something.  One episode, he had a soccer ball named Wilson that he was talking about.  But he punctures the hole to make for dramatic TV, knowing he's going to get out.  He has plenty of time.  Of course he is.  You know?  Because he's not going to take that chance with a leaky rowboat when he starts out on  his journey, knowing that he would be fucked in the middle of this thing.  So he does things like that, obviously, to make it a little more dramatic.  Yeah, see, that's bullshit.  But still a great show.  I don't like that set-up shit. 
[03:36:30]  Someone saw the show where they had a rescue survivor man, Mark in Boston.  Hey, Eric.  Morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hey.  That episode of Survivor Man?  Yeah.  Where they had to rescue him?  He was simulating a boat going down, and so it was just him and that little raft out  in the middle of the ocean.  And they had a crew on standby in another boat a couple miles away or something.  And this huge storm rolled in out of nowhere.  And so they had to get him off the raft, or else he would have gone down. 
[03:37:00]  But at least he admitted that, you know what, I didn't make it this time.  See, I would like to see that with Man vs. Wild.  Well, they put him back on the raft, actually.  Like, the storm passed, and they put him back on the raft.  Yeah.  So he tried his hardest, but...  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Jay in Jersey.  Jay?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, Patrice, I saw you stand up, man.  Fucking hilarious.  Anyway, dude, that guy's a dick.  Let me tell you why.  One time he went over there, and he's like, he's trying to find, like, some bait to go  fishing or whatever.  And he's like, oh, look, I found a dead animal in this avalanche, right? 
[03:37:30]  And he finds these fucking leeches.  He's like, oh, look, you can eat them.  They're a good source of protein.  They were fucking mealworms that somebody planted in that thing.  And it was dog shit, dude.  Totally fake.  And then you could tell there were mealworms.  He's saying they're leeches.  And then another time, he's like, oh, look, we could cross this path by this old bridge.  It's a brand-new friggin' rope that they put on the floor.  Mudworms?  Mealworms, yeah.  I know what they are.  White and maggoty, yellow things that look like you feed them to lizards.  Yeah, we've had them for the 55 Down Drum Challenge. 
[03:38:00]  So, wait, this is Man vs. Wild you don't like or Survivor Man?  Which guy is the skinny guy with the brown hair?  That's Man vs. Wild, special ops, British dude.  Dude, that guy, it's fake, dude.  He's making good TV.  Yeah, he's making good TV.  But, I mean, go out there and do it, you know, on your own.  And I'm having guys prop shit over there and saying, oh, yeah, I just found this goddamn  leech off of this dead animal.  I'd be sucking down mealworms from the pet store.  I got to beat myself up.  Or, actually, I got to go to Ray.  Ray in Virginia, go ahead. 
[03:38:30]  Hey, I wanted to ask you, where is a dessert island?  And is that where E-Rock is?  Damn, you took my line.  I was going to come back strong.  I was going to say, it's an island where E-Rock hangs out on.  Dessert island.  I went to this knowing I could pull a huge comeback, and he took my line.  Some other guy was bashing me.  He goes, Anthony, what's Lard of the Flies?  I said, that's E-Rock's version of the story.  Lard of the Flies.  That motherfucker.  I don't remember saying Lard of the Flies, but perhaps I did. 
[03:39:00]  That motherfucker, like, threw in a nice lofty softball and then ran to home plate and  hit it himself.  You fucker.  Bastard.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to...  Well, yeah, we're going to do...  An anchor guy, he said the F-word, but it's kind of funny why he did it.  Oh, nice.  And then we'll get into line of the day.  This is a very special show.  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison sex.  Give it to me.  We know what guys want to hear on the radio.  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Get those chunks.  They will exercise restraint. 
[03:39:30]  This is going to be an awful show.  Hold on tight, kids.  V.O.B. and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:40:00]  Having a fine time today with Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Always fun when Patrice drops in.  That's right.  Just like it.  Anyway, we got some audio.  We haven't done anything today, really, but...  Anything?  But goof off.  What a great show we've had.  I think it was a fine show.  Just babbling.  Wichita anchor shouts F-word.  Who gives a shit, right? 
[03:40:30]  What did he do?  But it's kind of funny.  How did he get away with that?  KSN-TV Wichita sports director Jim Cobb had become frustrated with technical problems  during the 6 p.m. newscast and shouted the F-word at a technical director as a pre-recorded  feature was being played on the air.  Uh-oh.  And it got thrown behind the...  Well, I guess he's playing maybe a highlight reel or something.  He wants to talk over it, and it probably fucked up, and he was like, ah, I'm not, I'm not.  Fuck.  Fuck.  He got frustrated.  Tomorrow will be their first game of the new year, and Casey Walkup tells us their resolution 
[03:41:00]  is to toughen up.  Cobra, the Thunder enters 2007 with an 11-14-2 record.  That's 20 games out of place.  Hey, fuck off, Buzz.  So their New Year's resolution is to simply win more games.  Hey, fuck off, Buzz.  I guess I was wrong.  Wow, and he yelled that.  He thought they had turned his mic off while the tape piece was playing, and this guy  pissed him off somehow.  But his mic was live. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, that's great.  I gotta hear that again.  Tomorrow will be their first game of the new year, and Casey Walkup tells us their resolution  is to toughen up.  Cobra, the Thunder enters 2007 with an 11-14-2 record.  That's 20 games out of place.  Hey, fuck off, Buzz.  So their New Year's resolution is to simply win more games.  And the reporter heard it.  You can tell, because he pauses.  He hears like, oh.  He pauses and just goes, oh boy.  I better keep going.  Oh. 
[03:42:00]  That's pretty good, huh?  Like, I think when he said, hey, fuck off, Buzz, he then realized what he said and went  like, oh.  All of a sudden, your career flashes before your eyes.  You know that feeling?  All right.  Wow.  What consequences?  Anything?  Fired?  Fired.  Fired.  Bill, you know?  No, Bill doesn't know.  No.  Do you know anything?  Bill doesn't.  Do you know your last name? 
[03:42:30]  Bill knows bangs.  Bill's got some banging bangs now, motherfucker.  What happened to the swoop cut?  My Armenian haircut guy decided to cut my bangs shorter.  Armenian?  Yes.  What does that have to do with the fact that he's a...  I don't know.  He's a slick character.  I really can't direct him when he cuts my hair.  You just go to a barbershop with an Armenian guy there.  Yeah.  And he went straight across and cut him kind of short. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  That's what we call...  The bowl cut.  Yeah, me and my girlfriend call it the retard hair because it's got, like, the retard bangs  that are really kind of short.  It'll grow in.  Your hair grows like weeds.  Yes.  But, uh...  Yeah, that's it.  Take your headphones off for a second.  Okay.  That's great.  What?  You're openly laughing at me.  No, no.  It's just...  I'm not used to seeing him with the bangs like that.  That's all.  It'll grow back.  He was suspended? 
[03:43:30]  Oh.  I'm like, Bill was suspended for having a bad haircut?  What?  Oh, the, uh...  Anchorman.  Yeah.  Was, uh, suspended for the F-word.  Oh, suspended.  All right.  Very good.  Perish the thought.  Perish the thought.  That F-word gets through.  Ooh.  But, uh, uh, make sure you show Saddam, uh, with the noose around his neck 80 times so  two kids can fucking hang themselves directly tied to that.  Show enough violence and fucking killing on the news, but watch out for the F-word or boobies. 
[03:44:00]  Ooh.  Patrice is getting sleepy.  Mm-mm.  You all right?  Yeah, I'm here.  Nah, I hear...  I'm focused.  Yeah, right.  Barely.  Well, I'm here.  Yeah, you're fine.  Yeah.  We all got up so early.  I don't...  Yesterday never existed.  It didn't.  Got home, went right to sleep.  When the history of Greg Opie Hughes is written, it's going to be noted that January 10th, 2007  never existed. 
[03:44:30]  It just shot on by.  You skipped that day.  Somehow I went from Tuesday to Thursday.  Uh, Lauren from New York City.  Yes?  Hi, Lauren.  Hi.  How are you?  I'm tired of the day.  Oh, wow.  Oh, excuse me two seconds.  What's the problem, Opie?  I ran out of deodorant about a month ago.  A month ago?  I said, you know what?  I don't need deodorant.  Fuck that.  And I swear to God, I just smelled an odor, and no offense, Stan.  I'm like, wow, Stan is barking today.  And then I realized it's me. 
[03:45:00]  Wow.  Well, was that shirt laundered?  Why, is it stained?  No, I'm just wondering.  No, it's, I keep my laundry up to date.  It's one of the things I do do.  Oh, okay.  You do do.  You know what?  You know what I've learned to do?  I keep deodorant everywhere.  Yeah?  Everywhere.  I, uh, keep it in my house, so that, that way, there have been some mornings I've been  so groggy, I've walked out of the house and gone, shit, I didn't put on deodorant.  Open up the console, drive down the road. 
[03:45:30]  Wah, wah, putting on deodorant.  I had some here.  I don't know where it went.  Well, I could use it right now.  Didn't we have some of the spray?  No, I'm going.  Here it is.  I'm going home.  Wow.  Wow.  There you go.  Oh, a little refreshing right guard.  Oh, my God.  By the way, um, fucking bad hygiene motherfuckers.  Just, just stink.  You should, you should stink for the punishment of it.  For the punishment.  Put salt under there or something.  That helps out, man.  Salt.  Salt does help. 
[03:46:00]  Salt.  Fucking salt.  It helps the fuck out, man.  What kind of shit is, no, you can't say, I'm just trying to, I'm just, when we call  you out on it, go, man.  If you put salt on your arms, that shit will take, take the smell away.  And for emergency cases, you, you, you know what?  You two cavemen smelling motherfuckers.  I forgot, I use my deodorant every day.  I forgot to tell you, Ant.  I'm washed.  We all went down to Atlantic City for New Year's for Jim Norton's show.  Yeah.  And we were down there, what, two days?  Something like that?  Yeah, three, maybe. 
[03:46:30]  Two and a half.  I forgot to pack underwear, so I had one pair.  And then I was too lazy to go buy it.  Because especially in Atlantic City, you can't just go buy underwear.  You have to leave the casino, go into the projects, or go into, like, the shithole that  is the rest of the area.  Hey, you got a few stores on the strip.  You want to come in, though?  I said, fuck it.  No, I just wore the same pair every day.  I have a shoeshine rag in his pants.  I didn't give a shit.  Oh, God.  You got mealworms in your drawers.  God damn. 
[03:47:00]  Two plane trips?  Two layovers?  Hey.  In the same fucking underwear?  Funky fuck.  Holy shit.  No, Atlantic City.  Put those marshmallows in your mouth.  Oh, oh, I thought you meant Vegas.  I was going to say, no wonder that chick fucking fell on her face.  Put marshmallows in your mouth and say, funky fuck, with 21  marshmallows.  Now people are writing the history of Greg Opie Hughes.  Oh.  Mr. Torrance, he writes, January 10th, 2007, didn't exist.  April 27th, 1985, shoves marshmallows up ass. 
[03:47:30]  Thank you, Mr. Torrance, for remembering.  The history.  All right.  Lauren.  Yes.  Hi.  Thanks for holding.  You're from New York City.  Yep.  And what do you want to do?  Well, I heard about this money snatch thing.  Oh.  Yeah.  Now, how'd you hear about this?  From one of my friends at work.  One of your friends.  And how did they describe the money snatch?  Yeah, we're curious. 
[03:48:00]  They kind of described it as putting money not where your mouth is.  Yeah.  You can't use hands.  You could be pretty graphic.  We're on satellite right now.  I know.  Yeah.  Well, basically, we wanted to know.  Lauren, basically what Anthony is saying, what word do you use for cunt in your life?  Um.  Um.  Coochie.  Coochie.  Okay.  Money coochie.  Yeah.  Coochie.  Anyway.  Does that work for you?  Yeah.  That's fine. 
[03:48:30]  Whatever you like.  Whatever sounds fun for you.  Great.  Now, doesn't this contest have a fun element to it?  It kind of does, but we're just confused about, like, how exactly it worked.  All right.  Should we play the promo for her and then see if she's still interested?  No promo.  Let's just play it.  Lauren, because the promo stinks.  It doesn't put the contest in the proper light, I believe.  Lauren, and I aren't the greatest broadcasters, and we're wordy at times. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  So why not just play a promo, and then we'll see what you think.  Oh, no.  I don't think so.  Here's the promo for Money Snatch.  It explains all the details of this fine contest.  Lauren's busy.  She's probably got to go.  But get her information, and...  Here, of course.  Not her interest.  Lauren, listen closely.  Here is the promo for the Money Snatch contest.  Okay.  We at the Opie and Anthony Show would like to give those less fortunate a chance to spread  joy to the ones they love. 
[03:49:30]  And the best way we know how to spread joy is to spread cash.  All over the floor and blow it around the room with a leaf blower while a bunch of  screaming naked women frantically try to grab as much as they can.  It's the return of the Money Snatch on the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're looking for desperate, broke, insecure women to come in studio, get naked, chase around  flying money, and cram as much of it into their holiest of holes, all in an effort to make 
[03:50:00]  someone's life a little brighter.  We know how much you hate picking up clothes at the Goodwill.  And wouldn't it be nice to not have to dig through the garbage to find cigarettes?  And wouldn't you love to take a dump in a functioning toilet and not a spackle bucket?  Of course you would!  So ladies, walk your broke ass down to your local public library.  Use their free internet and go to opieandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com for contest details.  Lauren? 
[03:50:30]  Lauren?  Yeah?  Uh, Lauren?  See?  Lauren, are you there?  Lauren?  Hello, Lauren?  Okay.  Alright, that just...  See, no, what...  We're sorry, your call did not go through.  Will you please hang up and try your call again? 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  This is a recording.  No shit.  Is it?  Is it?  No, I thought it was a live voice.  Alright, a quickie before we leave.  Quickie before we...  We have one goddamn contestant.  Finally.  Just because a friend told her and didn't describe the promo.  Just proving our point.  That the promo might be a little harsh.  Hmm.  Is she calling back? 
[03:51:30]  I don't...  Lauren?  I don't see her calling.  Back.  No.  Yeah, good.  Miramar looking for a rapist who was out for revenge, but may have chosen the wrong victim.  Police say the victim came home from the grocery store with a child, and the rapist was already  inside the house along Southwest 67th Avenue.  A man said the attack was payback for money owed to him by her husband and called out his  name, but it wasn't the name of the victim's husband.  Oh, wow. 
[03:52:00]  Can you imagine?  Looks like the wrong person got fucked.  By the way, someone's helping you out, Patrice.  CSI Miami is on at 1 p.m. today on A&E.  Oh.  So you can catch up a little bit.  You can just check it out for yourself before you go to sleep there.  Wow.  Raped?  The wrong fucking...  Yeah.  Walked into the house.  Basically, man...  Rapes the woman. 
[03:52:30]  Here's the story.  Man borrowed money from another man, didn't pay it back, and as payback, the man sets  off to rape his wife, only he breaks into the wrong house and rapes the wrong wife.  Oh.  She's just baking cookies and has no clue.  Oh, what the fuck is going on?  Yes, Stan?  And her two-year-old may have seen it.  May have.  May have witnessed it.  But the one hot part in the whole story.  Oh.  How awful is that?  It's like, no, you got the wrong... 
[03:53:00]  What does the poor woman say?  Got the wrong guy.  What the hell is that?  My phone.  Phone, huh?  He's got a radio show now.  He gets calls.  Lauren.  Yeah?  What happened to you?  He laughs at himself.  You guys hung up on me.  We didn't hang up on you.  What happened?  Yeah, you did.  All right.  Hi, Lauren.  I say we did.  This is why you can't get any girls on this.  Exactly.  Now...  You keep up waiting and waiting and waiting.  That promo was ridiculous and you were waiting too long.  Now, you said you had a question.  Yeah, what...  Yeah, exactly.  Like, can you put it under your arms or does it just have to be in your hole? 
[03:53:30]  Did you hear the promo?  I did, but I want...  There has to be other details.  Take a breath.  Take a breath, Opie.  Yeah, relax.  Take a deep breath.  Relax.  You have to roll the dollar bills up and shove them in your...  Let's just...  Now, now, hold on.  What happens is...  Let me give you the scene.  It's very festive, energy-filled day.  Well, the scene is very obvious.  The girls come in and roll up the dollar bills and then what they do is they take the dollar bills and they shove it...  You know, sometimes you describe the end of a movie and it sounds like shit, but if you take it in the context of the entire movie, it's wonderful. 
[03:54:00]  Speaking of shit, you roll up the dollars.  It has nothing to do with the shit.  Unless you want to...  Dollar bill?  Huh?  Here's what we do.  There are ones, there are fives, twenties, fifties, even a few hundreds thrown in there.  And you can use your hands to collect all the dollar bills and roll them up into a nice dildo-shaped thing and then you...  But you're not giving the whole ambiance of the scene of the day. 
[03:54:30]  There's a lot of girls in there and we talk with everybody on air and get everybody's story and we have fun that way.  And then when the game starts, it's very festive and a lot of money's blowing around.  And you girls are laughing because you're picking up money and then you have to put the money in your most intimate of area in any way, shape, or form you want. 
[03:55:00]  It's not just like...  Money's kind of dirty, though.  The handkerchief and the magician's just...  You might get a yeast in it.  Money's kind of dirty.  Money's kind of dirty, that's why you, if you want, you can roll it up, roll a condom on it, and then stick it up there.  That's what we wanted to know.  You could use a condom if you want.  Okay.  I think you'd get less money in there.  Or if you could shove double penetration, maybe, a condom on the front, a condom in the ass. 
[03:55:30]  Than has an idea.  Two condoms in one.  Than just gave me a great idea.  We're also a great idea.  Yes, Than?  Balloon Nut Cash is worth double.  Wow, so if you shove a 20 up your ass, it's worth 40 bucks.  Yeah.  That's worth it.  Now you're bringing in people.  See, but the whole atmosphere, very festive.  Yeah.  And we understand...  Are you a working gal, Lauren?  I am a working gal.  She's a working girl.  You ever been in a dumpster for food or clothes?  No.  See?  That promo is for shit.  Yeah. 
[03:56:00]  That's not really enticing.  Like, you don't want to...  No, thank you.  Are you going to do it or not?  I'm thinking about it.  You're into it?  What about any friends of yours, Lauren?  I have a friend here that would definitely do it.  All right.  Yeah.  I hope it's a she.  She is a she.  Okay.  Yes.  Well, can we hand you off to our crack staff over there and have them get your information  and your friends' info?  Definitely.  All right.  That would be wonderful.  Great.  Now, doesn't it sound like...  Aside from, you know, what's going on and how you have to, you know, pack the cash in. 
[03:56:30]  And for some people, that's a lot of fun, too.  Doesn't the whole day kind of sound fun?  It sounds like tons of fun.  Yeah.  You only keep what you put in?  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  So you just shove as much as you can get in.  You got it.  You got to learn because now there's a whole thing.  You got to work with time and effort.  See, that you can take a lot of time.  Well, you just...  A lot of time to roll the money up tightly and then put it in a condom.  Which is basically what Ant's saying is if you're a size queen, you're going to come 
[03:57:00]  away with a lot more cash.  So that's what I'm saying, Dave.  Like Caligula fists.  The magician in the handkerchief, the magician...  The handkerchief in the magician's fist...  Right.  ...technique is a bad technique or a good technique?  That's probably bad.  If I was a girl, I would roll it up very tight, shove it in condoms in different rolls.  You know, roll up, shove it in the condom, roll up, shove it in the same condom until  you have a condom full of about ten rolls and then, whammo, there it goes. 
[03:57:30]  A little KY.  Yeah.  And then you have to...  Oh, well, this...  Will you shut up?  And then you have to queef chubby pussy as the money is in there.  What if you get one of those condoms, those dildos that have the twist tops?  That's cheap.  That's like a corked bat, Patrice.  You can't use the equipment like that.  All right, listen, Lauren...  That would be like a corked bat.  You could take a fucking...  A goddamn thermos, fill it up with cash, and shove it up there. 
[03:58:00]  We need, you know, the cash to be in a condom and then up there.  And up the ass, double the value of the money.  Brilliant.  All right, Lauren, you think it over, okay?  Who ain't shoving money up their ass?  All right?  Yeah.  All right, there goes Lauren.  Thank you.  All right.  There's something about her I don't like.  Rob, I like...  She's a willing contestant.  Yeah, I hate to rewind there, Rob, but you guys are cheering in the rapist's grandstand.  He's got the wrong house.  That's the crime?  The wrong house?  Hey.  Well, yeah. 
[03:58:30]  Well, if this woman wants to hang out with a guy that ain't paying his fucking debts,  that's her problem.  Dude, I need to be more careful.  Yeah, Rob makes a good point.  The problem we had with the story was that he raped the wrong woman.  Not the fact that he...  Some guy owed him money.  No, that he raped the wrong innocent woman.  Yeah.  Because they were both innocent.  You're right, Rob.  I love you guys.  Bye-bye.  God, thanks for pointing that out.  We're a bunch of dummies.  We're like, geez, that sucks.  He raped the wrong woman.  God, we're terrible.  We are awful.

They're doing that ultimate fighting thing and living in a house and beating each other up.  Russians and Americans, I think.  Some kind of thing like that.  Go to Bowdogfight.com.  A fine sponsor of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[04:00:00]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  He was a giant monster two days ago.  Huge hit arms.  He retired and now he's 150 pounds playing golf.  What happened?  He was whacking baseballs into parking lots.  He looks like Benton Midland now.  He looks like Benton Midland.  Yes, of course.  All right, well.  Everything's more dramatic with that. 
[04:00:30]  Of course.  We talked about Mark McGuire there.  Oh, yeah.  If you're just tuning in.  Poor guy.  He's not going to be in the Hall of Fame.  No.  Skinny.  Skinny.  All those drugs for nothing.  Skinny white golf guy.  Bobby Bigrigger.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Happy New Year.  Yeah, you too.  Yeah, I got what I learned today.  Yeah.  I learned it.  I only got five cans of beer.  One can short of a six-pack.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bobby Bigrigger. 
[04:01:00]  Yeah, he talked over the dramatic music.  The dramatic sting.  One can short.  Patrice, thanks a lot.  Yeah.  Hey, no problem.  Can I give you a...  If you want.  The little punch.  The little, hey, thank you, trooper.  Yeah, I'll take it.  You're a good egg, Noonan.  All right.  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  Ooh.  God, this week's flying by, man.  I can't believe tomorrow's Friday.  Wow.  You know?  But we can feel good because we gave everyone a great week of radio. 
[04:01:30]  I think we gave them a great week of radio.  I think the week was so good that I think we should take Monday off.  Well, it is a holiday.  In honor of that fine black man, Martin Luther King.  And tomorrow is actually Tuesday for you guys, so it's like a midweek show.  Oh, yeah.  The excitement will be amazing for the people.  Actually, because everyone's going to be yelling and screaming.  This is Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  We will be working on Monday because we don't acknowledge the black man. 
[04:02:00]  Well, I wouldn't put it that way.  I would say that for years we have just worked on Martin Luther King Day.  For some reason, we don't get that off.  Pieces of garbage.  I would love it off.  You know what you motherfuckers get?  White people got Kohl's Day.  You know what you get?  You get the day off when the first white man invented the trolley.  You get that day off.  Yeah.  You get that.  You get that.  Yep.  That's a good bit for Monday.  Because they still haven't made an official day off, right? 
[04:02:30]  Martin Luther King?  Yes, it's a fucking holiday.  Yeah, it's a federal holiday.  Oh, really?  It is finally?  But a lot of people don't recognize it.  Not radio stations.  Not the NYPD.  Yeah.  Do you recognize Christmas?  The fire department doesn't recognize it.  Radio stations are on every day.  I'm not on.  Well, you're not on, but they make you work on.  But you know what?  The important people.  First of all, you know what?  I'm fucking leaving because I'm going to tell you why.  What happened?  Why?  First of all.  Are you mad? 
[04:03:00]  No.  Nah.  I just want to leave.  Second of all.  I just want to leave because I'm tired.  You motherfuckers can work or not work any day you want.  And you chose not to work on Christopher Columbus.  I think I worked on Columbus Day.  No, we worked there.  Halloween, you're off.  Yeah.  You do a special fun show on Halloween.  Yeah, we did a show.  We had to get our costumes.  Martin Luther King Day, the guy that tried to uplift the fabric of this fucking country.  You just, you're going to work.  They threw it.  And not even acknowledge the shit. 
[04:03:30]  They threw the black man a bone.  You won't even play James Brown music on Monday.  We'll be on the air acknowledging it.  That's right.  Where will the other stations that get the day off and black men and women be on Martin  Luther King Day?  They'll be home doing what?  Celebrating his fucking bullshit.  They will not even give it a thought.  Listening together with a Yule Log type of feel.  A Yule Log.  Listening to I Have a Dream speech.  That's what I'm going to be doing.  That's what I do on Martin Luther King Day.  And what we'll be doing, we're going to be allowing the listeners to give shootouts on 
[04:04:00]  Monday.  Yeah, we're going to do shootouts.  A lot of Martin Luther King, you know, other stations do shoutouts, we're going to do  shootouts.  Something with a bunch of squigginess in it.  And all he did was help this country to be what it is.  Help this country to let black men know that it's okay to fuck white women.  That was, that was the Scottsboro boys.  They don't get a holiday either.  Hey, I'm not knocking the guy.  Jesus.  That was Nat Turner.  He deserves a holiday. 
[04:04:30]  I mean, Martin Luther King was a beautiful man.  On Monday, I bet we have our biggest audience listening in Boston.  He was like, yes.  He was like Gandhi for black people.  Boston won't even miss a step.  I liked his, uh, I liked his ideology on preaching, uh, nonviolence.  I like that.  Yeah.  That seems to have gone away.  Here's my thing.  I consider him a saint.  And this is true.  Saint Martin Luther King.  Why don't we wear chains with like little balconies or whatever? 
[04:05:00]  Him on the balcony.  Yeah, like with, with Jesse Jackson pointing us just as a, yeah, as a commemorance we do  with, with the Jesus, we have to have some kind of commemorative jewelry for Martin Luther  King.  I like your, uh, your thinking.  You understand what I'm saying to you?  Yeah.  He's, he's, he's considered, well, it's gotta be only five saints and Mother Teresa, him,  Gandhi, Jesus.  I would consider him and put him in the same category.  Maybe it's too soon.  I think his timing was off.  Definitely.  So basically what you're saying is that we should, uh, take a page out of the black 
[04:05:30]  man's book and take a day off Monday.  I didn't even see the black man's book.  But the thing is, black people, taking days off mean nothing.  You have to commemorate the situation.  Not in the black community.  It's called any day of the week.  I'll take KKK day off.  You have to work to actually take a day off.  When's Ty Cobb's birthday?  I'll take that shit off.  I'll take off, uh, David Duke day.  When's his birthday?  I'll take, I don't give a fuck.  I'm looking not to work, but it's commemorating the situation. 
[04:06:00]  Just acknowledge the man.  We will acknowledge it on the air.  People loved each other, man.  In our own special way.  They put a lot of love out there.  Ain't a lot of people that pumped love in this country.  I enjoyed the non-violence of the whole thing.  Andy Garcia or something.  He was able to unite people.  Uh, I said Andy Garcia, whatever the fucking guy is.  That wonderful speech he gave in Washington, D.C.  He didn't even know one or two words from that speech.  I have a dream.  I know that one.  Besides that.  We will see the mountaintop. 
[04:06:30]  Nigga, what's up?  Chilling in the crib.  What's up, B?  Uh, I know it all.  Exactly.  It's a fucking shame.  And we will all get there.  It's a shame.  And climb that mountaintop.  And, and one small step for a nigga, one giant leap for nigger kind.  One giant white ass for me.  I don't know what he said.  What does this mean?  He did not fuck white women.  What is this?  That's what the FBI files say. 
[04:07:00]  That they took him as they tapped his phones illegally.  That's right.  I think they sucked his dick.  I don't think he actually fucked.  Really?  All right.  Then that's it.  And it was against the law of a black man to say no to a white woman sucking his dick in the 60s.  It was.  They could have shot that.  I want to suck your dick, sir.  Uh, I guess you have to.  I don't want to go to jail.  Uh, Patrice, don't read the answer to feedback.  Because, uh, they got suggestions on, uh, what you should wear around your neck for MLK Day.  Pluck these pieces of shit.  These motherfuckers.  Why are we?  You know what?  Oh, my God. 
[04:07:30]  No, they didn't.  You know what?  Pieces of dirt.  For the first time in my career, look at this.  Oh, they didn't.  I am turning off that computer screen.  Wow, that is bad.  No motherfuckers out there.  Hey, you suggested it.  You know what?  I'm going to pay you.  What they should wear around their neck.  All white holidays are now off my list.  I do not celebrate any more white holidays.  What about Groundhog Day?  It's kind of an animal holiday.  What do you think?  That's not a day off.  I'm just thinking because it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  It's very neutral.  We don't get that off, though, right?  Well, y'all treat it like a nigga, too.  What about Fourth of July? 
[04:08:00]  Make him come out and be scared of his own shadow.  That's true.  Make his eyes big.  Fuck y'all.  Everyone loves the Groundhog.  I'm celebrating Martin Luther King Day.  I'm celebrating...  Fourth of July?  Independence Day?  No, because that's the independence of this country.  That's a white holiday.  No.  Yeah.  Christmas is Jesus' birthday.  Yes, I will because he's a Jew.  New Year's Eve.  New Year's Eve.  You celebrate that?  Celebrate the...  Is that whitey holiday?  I might...  That's a whitey holiday.  I might start celebrating just the year of... 
[04:08:30]  The Chinese shit.  Oh, Chinese New Year.  Year of the rat, year of the squirrel, whatever shit is that.  Whatever the shit that is.  What about Easter?  Easter.  Jesus.  More Jesus-y stuff.  More Jesus.  I'm taking Easter, yes.  All right.  Say Patty's Day.  Fuck Snow.  Fuck Snow.  Wow.  Fuck Snow.  Fuck Snow.  I'm not celebrating.  No more St. Patrick's Day.  No.  No.  No Mick holidays.  Kiss me on my Irish.  Fuck that shit.  Everyone's Irish on St. Patrick's Day, don't you know?  St. Patrick's No.  Everyone's Irish.  No, you don't get it. 
[04:09:00]  We don't fucking get it.  No.  I know Snow is white, but why fuck Snow?  Fuck Snow.  Thanksgiving.  Fuck Snow.  It's really fuck Snow, but it all comes together.  Fuck Snow.  So you don't like Snow because it's white?  Uh, celebrate your white folks murdering Indians.  Yeah.  And tricking them out of their land.  I'd ask you about Labor Day, but you don't even know what the word means.  See, that's why I'm not celebrating it.  It's a union holiday.  You guys get one fucking holiday.  You know what, union?  I'll do it.  Martin Luther King. 
[04:09:30]  Labor Day, union, it's union.  And I will, I will, unions represent everybody.  I'm going to do Labor Day.  Memorial Day.  Soldiers.  Only.  A lot of African American soldiers.  Remembering the after World, uh, Korean War up because we had a lot of problems in World  War I, a lot of problems in World War II.  It's Iggy Airman.  And we stopped.  No.  Holy shit.  The heroes.  Fuck you and that one, that one movie we get.  That's all I know.  Niggas get one movie every year to say we was doing something. 
[04:10:00]  The Civil War.  We won the Civil fucking war.  We get that one nigga movie, Glory, where Denzel won the Civil War.  How the fuck did black people win the Civil War?  What the fuck?  We single-handedly won the Civil, uh, Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington, Andre Bauer, and,  and, and, uh, Matthew Broderick.  Yeah.  One.  One.  Would you go up to every union soldier's rifle and shove a piece of cotton in there? 
[04:10:30]  We, we, we fucking helped win the war, the Civil War.  So I will commemorate, uh, Memorial Day.  You will.  Memorial Day will be.  Helped in what way?  Helped meaning our, our bravery, our courage to help fight to get free from the regime of  the South.  I think being used as a tool by the North as threatening that.  What else is new, motherfucker?  That's what you doing now?  Threatening more so than, than, uh, charging a line of black men. 
[04:11:00]  Well, well, I think, according to the end of that movie, we, we tried to help, uh, tackle  that.  There's one for it.  I understand.  Very brave.  Very brave.  They never took that fort.  I know they never took the fort, but we didn't take Vietnam, motherfucker.  So, so all I'm saying is I will commemorate Memorial Day.  Okay.  Because it, it, a lot of black, black people fought hard for a country that didn't fight  and fight hard for it.  So we're going, I'm going to say Memorial.  Let's, let's go over these. 
[04:11:30]  All right.  Memorial.  I will celebrate.  I will celebrate, uh, Labor Day because of unions and, and that represents the work.  Halloween.  You won't.  Fuck Halloween.  Thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving is possible.  I got to have one food holiday.  Oh, that's just for the food.  Not for the fact that it's whitey coming over here.  Because I'm saying no to Independence Day, which is a big foodie day, but it's, it's for  the independence of this country's, uh, from underneath white people, the dirty white people  that took over this country.  Yeah.  They're celebrating their independence from the dirty white people that, that actually 
[04:12:00]  started the country.  But Thanksgiving then should be even more filthy of a holiday.  I have to judge.  You can't take all food holidays from me.  So I have to wait out Thanksgiving.  Now you got to think of this, even though they were lily white, these are people that  were oppressed.  They were leaving oppression to come to a new world.  Matter of fact, to be honest with you, uh, Anthony, if you want to be specific, it does  Independence Day and Thanksgiving are sort of in the same realm of holiday because so 
[04:12:30]  it depends on what part do I want to, do I want to commemorate, um, the, the, the evil  white folks that came here, the prisoners, the criminals that floated here from England  to start this country.  Thanksgiving doesn't celebrate anything.  It's a made up holiday.  It celebrates the, the Indians and the pilgrims who were working together.  You learned this in the third grade.  Get the fuck out of here, nigga!  Shit!  And Columbus, he came over and taught the Indians how to do the cha-cha and salsa too, didn't  he?  Remember in elementary school, we used to make the little things of the Indians and the 
[04:13:00]  pilgrims sitting at the same table working together?  Exactly.  For me.  For me.  Fuck them.  Exactly.  They did work together.  Yeah.  With musket balls right on the top of their fucking head.  Musket balls.  And we learned how they worked on Indian heads in the spirit of cooperation.  Great and pillage.  And then we gave them the old anthrax and the blanket trick.  That was a great gag.  I will thank white people for is, is for, that, that's your, your weak genes.  Yeah.  Your weak DNA helps to just soften some of the, the, like I, I really do enjoy a lot of these 
[04:13:30]  different little, uh, little brown skin, little things, these little yellow girls.  I do enjoy yellow girls.  Yeah.  You like all that.  So without your help, it wouldn't be a lot of these little yellow girls.  Well, oh, oh, you're talking like black and then white getting together.  Let me tell you.  Or Asian mixed up with a little bit of, you know.  You can make instant supermodels if you just take a black guy, white woman, put them  together.  They could be the haggiest looking motherfuckers and the prettiest little kid will come out. 
[04:14:00]  Couple of Tyra Banks is out there.  I don't know how that works.  That's the thing, but I'm, I'm sorry.  Tyra Banks is a fat fuck.  Did you see her on the cover of Star Magazine?  More delicious.  Oh.  And the further her self-esteem goes, the more I was like, I'll fuck up if she's 400 pounds.  They're calling her T-Rock now.  Christmas.  She has to do chubby bunny every time she gains another pound.  If you motherfuckers don't commemorate, and this is, this is based on what you guys are  going to do Monday.  If you guys don't, don't commemorate Martin Luther King in the correct manner, I am not going  to celebrate any more white holidays. 
[04:14:30]  Oh, shit.  Now the correct manner.  If you don't give it the proper reverence, like, hey, man, a proper, a one-minute moment  of silence.  Moment of silence?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Then the station goes off the air.  We have like this thing built in that if the station is too quiet for too long, music  comes out of Washington out of nowhere.  We'll play some type of music.  And it'll probably go to one of those KKK songs we got loaded in there.  Well, here's what I bought.  The house next door to me was sold to next. 
[04:15:00]  That's probably what'll start playing.  Ready?  Okay, here, you do this, and I will celebrate the holidays I've been celebrating.  Okay.  All right, listen, we got to go.  Fuck that.  We got to go.  Play, play two minutes of a speech.  Two minutes of a speech.  And I will celebrate the rest of it.  The big, the highlight.  Just play two minutes of a speech.  Two minutes of it.  Without interruption.  We're talking about how we all get to the promised land.  Oh, without interruption.  Two minutes of it.  Without a fucking, without interruption. 
[04:15:30]  No gunfire.  Fuck.  Without gunfire.  Wait a minute.  I have a dream.  Boring.  I have a dream.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Boring.  You have to do it.  I have a dream.  I have spoken, and it's as simple as that.  It's got to happen.  All right.  That's it.  Can you say, I have a dream again?  I have a dream. 
[04:16:00]  I have a dream.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  Shut up, Billy.  Can you say, I have a dream again?  I have a dream.  I have a dream.  Did you see that jerk?  Boo! 
[04:16:30]  I have a dream.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Let's see.  No, we really should.  It'll be Monday.  May.  If you will.  Yeah.  Do your Martin Luther King impression.  I have a dream.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Yeah.  See, that's not...  So Martin, but not Malcolm? 
[04:17:00]  I'll take Martin.  I like Malcolm, but I would take Martin.  I have a dream.  Sad, sad.  I got.  Anthony, if you will, once again.  I have a dream.  I am protecting myself.  I am scared of you.  Please follow the police.  You're a phony.  Hey, this guy's a great big phony.  Hey, you're a great big phony, you know that?  That's right.  You're a big fat phony. 
[04:17:30]  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  Yeah.  Well, he'll be here tomorrow.  And I might have one more.  Okay.  I have a dream.  Goddamn liar!  I have a dream.  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[04:18:00]  Oh, dear.  That's not right.  I might have one more.  I like the way Fan was so up on that.  I might have another one.  Okay.  I have a dream.  Shut up and sit down, you big bald fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Oh, that's not right.  Yeah, that's...  We, uh...  No, we will commemorate him in the way that we should. 
[04:18:30]  Yeah.  I have a dream.  He stinks and I don't like him.  Uh, Anthony, if you will.  Yeah.  I have a dream!  Shut up!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I have a dream!  Stop whining!  Stop it!  Oh, wow.  I kiss you on the mouth.  Well, someone...  See?  That's somebody that likes him very much.  Wow, we have, uh, audio of, uh, people that were in the audience that day when, when he 
[04:19:00]  yelled, I have a dream.  He's a fag!  Oh, that wasn't true.  Yeah, we don't know that.  I have a dream!  Shut up!  Jimmy.  Not even here.  And ask him if they want to help to save this country from the onslaught of integration.  You know, the system is they want to throw white children and colored children into the  building part of integration, throughout of which will come a conglomerated, the latter, 
[04:19:30]  the Mongol class of people, all of races will be destroyed in such a moment.  I have a dream today!  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  Let's see, that's not right.  Now we've gone way too far.  Too far.  Yeah.  That was, uh, why would a clip from Trading Places, why would Dan Aykroyd say something  so horrible?  Yeah, that's, uh... 
[04:20:00]  Playing all the clips we can't play Monday, by the way.  Let me tell you how upset I am about this bitch.  Yeah, I know.  40 minutes ago, Opie's like, oh, I gotta go.  Now, now his shoulders have gained new strength.  Now it's too much fun.  He can't leave now.  I just, I just gave my lunch order.  Yeah, all of a sudden, all of a sudden, you know, hey man, he's going to my schedule for  the day, he was putting on his little fucking roller skates.  Now is, I have a dream parody.  All of a sudden, a lot of energy for that. 
[04:20:30]  And I love the black man.  You smoke crack, don't you?  You smoke crack, don't you?  Look at me, boy!  Don't you smoke crack!  Marijuana is the bomb.  Yep.  Yeah, it is.  All right.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  I guess we should go.  Uninterrupted.  I have a dream speech.  Is that it?  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Uninterrupted.  That'd be good.  And I'll show you the holidays.  That we can do.  Well, why don't we turn off the phone screen and the instant feedback screen. 
[04:21:00]  Is it true that Monday is also Robert E. Lee's birthday?  Yes.  Patrice.  Thank you so much for coming in.  Peace is a program.  Oh, he's out.  He doesn't want any part of this shit.  I'm out.  He's practicing a non-violent form of protest.  He's just leaving the fucking show.  This is his way of showing he doesn't approve because he gets the air.  Take it easy.  Yeah, fight the power.  Fight the man.  He's got his fist up in the air.  I hope he sees Earl on the way in and they can commiserate. 
[04:21:30]  All right.  Why don't we go in?  Yeah, we ran through all of our sound clips anyway.  Hopefully, we'll be back tomorrow.  Hi.  I just love listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sometimes I laugh so hard, I forget about all the times my Uncle Henry rubbed my special place.  Opie and Anthony!  Line of the Day is brought to you by Bodog.
