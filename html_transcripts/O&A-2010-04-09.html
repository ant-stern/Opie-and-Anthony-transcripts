<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts celebrating new, individually-scented microphone windscreens, a stark improvement over the previously shared, breath-laden ones.  This transitioned into a call from Frank in Jersey, who lambasted the media's focus on Tiger Woods's return to the Masters, arguing that other golfers like Freddie Couples (whose gambling problems Frank discussed) and Tom Watson deserved more attention.  The conversation delved into Woods's public image and the perceived sincerity of his attempts to rehabilitate it after his infidelity scandal.  A suggestion to invite Frank back was rejected.  Patrice O'Neal was noted as a guest (Jimmy was absent due to HBO filming).  The discussion continued, comparing Woods's situation to other athletes' scandals (mentioning Mad Dog Russo's commentary and contrasting the public responses to the scandals of Woods, Kobe Bryant, and Tiki Barber).  The unusually long times of Major League Baseball games were criticized, prompting a caller, Matt from Long Island, to point out the irony given the show's five-hour runtime.  This sparked a discussion on radio show length and the industry's lack of innovation.  The segment concluded with further debate on Tiger Woods, corporate hypocrisy, anticipation of a "big reveal" regarding anonymous banners at the Masters, and a shift towards the new iPhone OS update, its multitasking and iAds features, and Opie's excessive use of the Paper Toss app.  Smartphone market share statistics (iPhone and Blackberry) were shared before the segment concluded.

The show continued with a comparison of smartphones, focusing on the iPhone, HTC HD2, and BlackBerry Storm 2.  Callers contributed their vulgar opinions on each phone's features (screen size, processing power, operating system – with heavy criticism of Windows Mobile – and multitasking).  A rumour regarding Jesse James using Sandra Bullock's credit card for prostitutes and Ian Halpern’s alleged withholding of this information from the show were also discussed.  The conversation then shifted to television viewing habits (DVDs vs. live TV), with the hosts expressing opinions on *Law Abiding Citizen*, *Date Night*, *30 Rock*, *Lost*, and *Seinfeld*, and their dislike for Jamie Foxx and Steve Carell.  A segment debated *Sober House* and Dr. Drew's alleged exploitation of its participants.  The show concluded with a prolonged, sexually explicit segment featuring Bobo, a recurring caller, who agreed to perform a sexual act with his dog on air to return to the show.  The segment also discussed a *Survivor* producer who murdered his wife and a Tiger Woods commercial.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest during part of this section.

A subsequent segment focused on baseball, comparing it to other sports (football, hockey, basketball, soccer).  The length of the baseball season (162 games), the relative excitement levels of different sports, and the perceived lack of intensity in baseball were debated.  The hosts' varying levels of enjoyment of baseball were expressed, along with discussions of baseball's history, traditions (umpires, replay reviews), and legendary players (Willie Mays, Dave Kingman).  The perceived negative aspects of soccer were also discussed, including the frequent changes in the "best player in the world" title and its perceived lack of appeal to American audiences.  The hosts also compared the skill level of American athletes across various sports.  Numerous audio clips were played, including a humorous soccer sideline report, a prank caller interrupting a mine disaster report, Tommy Lasorda's rant about Dave Kingman, Earl Weaver's tirade, and a Chris Rock stand-up routine about David Letterman's infidelity.  Patrice O'Neal, Mike Birbiglia, and Taylor Vixen (Penthouse Pet of the Year) were guests in the studio; a planned "boo-boo Lantern" segment with Vixen was mentioned.

The show then began a discussion about Zero Water filters, followed by a highly offensive commentary on a film depicting nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll, using extremely racist and misogynistic language.  This led to a studio interview with Mike Birbiglia and Taylor Vixen.  The interview was highly sexually explicit, focusing on Vixen's appearance, sexual experiences, preferences, and various sexual acts, using highly offensive and vulgar language.  The hosts and guests discussed dating dynamics and employed offensive language and stereotypes.  A graphic sexual video clip ("Guam" or "booyah" clip) was partially played, prompting further sexually charged commentary.  The interview ended with further discussions of Vixen's career, future plans, and dating opinions.  Jill (a former intern) and Lainey were also mentioned as being present in the studio.

A final segment featured Taylor Vixen, with the hosts and Patrice O'Neal engaging in sexually explicit and offensive conversations about her body (breasts, anus), experiences in the pornography industry, and explicit content from her photos and videos.  Vixen demonstrated "tweeting with her boobs".  Racist and sexist remarks, alongside graphic descriptions and jokes, were prevalent throughout this section. A date between Vixen and Anthony Cumia was arranged, with the suggestion of filming or recording it.  The hosts' behavior towards Vixen ranged from lewd to sexually suggestive, with explicit comments about various body parts, and vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We got to get that Pat Cooper back on the show.  Oh my God, how happy am I today?  Why?  You smell this nice, fresh...  Oh, I know, yes.  What is it called, the windscreen?  Yes, the windscreen is...  For the microphones?  Miraculous.  Oh my God.  I'm going to crash right off the bat.  I don't have to smell someone else's bad breath today.  Like I said, I don't mind smelling my own bad breath on a microphone, but I don't want to smell anyone else's.  That is the best smell ever. 
[00:00:30]  That is good.  Now, Mars, every day after the show, you got to take these things off, put them in a box.  I don't know.  I was like, no.  What?  Let's get an update.  Why can't they just do the right thing one lousy time?  It's a tight fit.  It's like a condom, man.  So what?  You can't take these off every morning?  You're going to rip them up eventually.  So we have to share these with everybody?  So then we didn't need these to begin with.  Well, better than the old ones. 
[00:01:00]  The point is that we want our own windscreen so we don't have to smell anyone else's breath.  I don't want...  I feel sorry for whoever sits in the seat after me and has to smell my bad breath, and I don't want to smell their bad breath.  So what happened?  So just take the whole mic off.  Yeah.  Do you have other mics?  Not these mics, no.  Give the other people another mic.  These are nice mics, too, by the way.  Yeah, they're all right.  All right, so we got new windscreens, but it's just a matter of time before they smell just like the old ones. 
[00:01:30]  Yes, sir.  Absolutely.  So we'll enjoy them for a week or two.  Enjoy them while you can.  I had a dream that we could have our own windscreen.  That's crazy.  No.  Isn't this like a billion-dollar fucking company?  Can't we have our own windscreens?  We should.  Here at SiriusXM?  Satellite radio?  Yeah.  Don't have our own studio.  At least windscreens.  Well, but they said we would have our own studio, Anthony.  This is our own studio.  That is lovely.  What does that smell like?  It's like Febreze. 
[00:02:00]  It smells like a little Febreze.  A little Febreze.  Oh, well, a little hint of Lysol.  Oh, you threw a little Lysol on them, too?  Absolutely.  Right on, Mars.  Thank you.  Why don't you put some of that under your fucking underarms?  Dirty Puerto Rican.  Oh, my God.  Oh, gosh.  Wow.  Oh, the blatant racism.  All right.  So this guy's like, fuck the mic screen. 
[00:02:30]  So I agree with you.  Frank in Jersey, what's going on, Frank?  Hey, we got to talk about this Tiger Woods bullshit.  I mean, it's like everybody's on their knees sucking this guy's dick out on the course.  You know what I mean?  I'm sick of it.  I love the way he plays golf.  I'm a golfer.  I wish I could play like that.  But everything, every announcer, everybody, Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods, Tiger Woods, there's  a 60-year-old that was leading the tournament.  Now there's a 50-year-old, Freddie Couples.  Yes, Freddie.  That's the leader of the tournament.  Let's talk about golf.  Let's show these guys.  You know what I mean?  I'm so sick of this Tiger stuff. 
[00:03:00]  They don't care.  Somebody called it.  They said, look, as soon as he walks back out on the course, they're going to forget  how many cunts he fucking nailed, how many stewardesses or cocktail waitresses.  They're not going to care.  And it showed yesterday.  What do you guys think about that?  Well, you make a lot of great points, actually.  First of all, before the scandal, it was frustrating to a lot of PGA fans that all they did was show  Tiger.  Yeah.  And they would blow.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And they would blow off all these other guys that actually have some skills on the course. 
[00:03:30]  But now after the scandal, I mean, the Tiger coverage is completely ridiculous.  And they are blowing off, you know, some good stories already.  Freddie Couples, this gambling addict.  Freddie is coming out of nowhere.  This Freddie Couples has, well, it's been documented that he might have a problem or two with gambling.  Really?  He's up there on the leaderboard.  Then you've got freaking Tom Watson.  He's 60 years old.  And he's one stroke out of the fucking lead.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  Absolutely.  But all they're doing is showing Tiger, wow, now Tiger is washing his balls in between  holes.  Here's Tiger walking to the next tee.  Here's Tiger eating a little sandwich as he waits the tee off.  Tiger, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger, Tiger.  Absolutely.  And it's just, it's absolutely sickening.  You know, I'm a big Yankees fan.  So I can understand how people hate the Yankees and they don't want to watch when the Yankees  are on TV or whatever.  That's how I feel about golf.  I've been a Freddie Couples fan since I'm a kid.  Okay.  I can watch him at all times.  Cause my game, the way I play is kind of modeled after Freddie, my swing, but I can't 
[00:04:30]  listen to you.  Hold on, Frank.  Hold on, Frank.  I'm going to call you out on your, you model your, your game after Freddie Couples.  What's your handicap?  I'm a seven handicap.  Oh, fuck.  Oh shit.  I'll shut up right now.  A seven's pretty impressive.  I, you know what?  I play a lot of golf.  Okay.  I coach my kids in baseball, basketball, and, uh, and, uh, football.  Okay.  But the thing is when I have time to go out, it's, it's serious to me.  You know, I don't bet. 
[00:05:00]  The only thing I bet on is myself.  Okay.  I'll go out there and bet on some golf.  And you know, if there's times I've shot 72, 71, seventies.  Okay.  Then I go out, I'll shoot an 87 and I'll be like, what the fuck is this?  Well, that's the beauty of golf.  Now, what do you know about Freddie Couples?  Cause you said you followed him.  Didn't he have some kind of gambling problems?  Yeah, he did.  Okay.  And when his, his first marriage dissolved, a lot of it was because of gambling.  Right.  Okay.  But it was, you know, it wasn't gambling on golf.  It wasn't gambling on, you know, he was just a gambler.  He liked college football.  He liked folk football. 
[00:05:30]  A lot of that was Vegas football.  Well, you know, you should be thankful that Tiger's in the hunt because either way, they're  going to show Tiger Woods the entire time.  So if he was really shit in the bed, they would still be showing every stroke that he does  in the masters.  So at least he's in the hunt to make it interesting, you know?  Yeah.  But did you see when he dropped, when he, uh, he had that bad shot and he throws his club  down and stomps like a little fucking girl?  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's the real Tiger.  He's, he's trying to, he's trying to make believe he's not that guy now because he's 
[00:06:00]  changing his image and they're like, and he's acknowledging the crowd more and he's appreciating  the crowd and he's appreciating his day here at Augusta.  And he's screaming when he misses shots.  Tiger Woods is calling us under his breath.  Yeah.  All that's fake, man.  He wants to be throwing clubs every time he makes a bogey.  Every time he misses a putt, he wants to be breaking, uh, sticks.  We used to call him sticks.  All Tiger wants back is that sponsorship money.  Right.  He wants all that advertising money back.  So he's going to do whatever he has to do to smile at everybody.  He's going to kiss some babies. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  He's going to do whatever he's got to do to get Gatorade and all that millions of dollars.  I got to tell you, you're, you're rooting for Freddie Couples.  I am pushing hard for this Tom Watson, man.  Are you kidding me?  Minus five after the first day, he's 60 years old.  And Tom Watson's the type of guy, he's not going to shit the bed.  He's a very steady golfer.  He's going to be, he's going to be up there on the leaderboard the entire time now.  Well, I mean, how great would it be to see Phil Mickelson, Freddie Couples, and Watson, 
[00:07:00]  like, say, one, two, three, the rest of the way.  How exciting would this Masters be without Tiger Woods?  I kind of want, I kind of want Tiger up there just because it's, that's a great story, too.  I mean, he comes back, he hasn't played in 150 days, and he's, he's at minus four right now.  He could have easily been at minus seven.  Easily.  Okay, he hasn't played competitively for 150 days.  Are we still talking about golf?  I know.  People hate Frank, by the way.  He's too abrasive.  Hey, Frank.  They hate him.  Frank, people don't like you.  People hate you, Frank. 
[00:07:30]  I kind of like, I kind of like Frank, because I get to talk a little golf.  Everyone hates Frank.  Guys, I could put my head on the pillow at night and be a happy guy.  All right.  They can hate me all they want, okay?  All right.  I speak for a lot of people that don't have the balls to speak up against Tiger.  Well, it's all fake.  I mean, you've got to realize that it's all bullshit.  Don't have the balls to speak up against Tiger?  To a lot of people, it's not fake.  Huh?  To a lot of people, it's not fake.  Wait.  Anthony's telling you, and I think he's right, people are speaking up about Tiger. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  But not as much.  You know what?  It's like radio that, you know, the conservative radio, the liberal radio, they only speak what  they're speaking.  You know, they speak their viewpoint.  But you know what?  Let's get a free radio that's out there and say, hey, look, you know, Tiger's a scumbag.  Let's treat him as a scumbag.  Hey, you want to invite Frank in?  Oh, my God, no.  Want to continue our new bit where we invite a guy in every once in a while?  No.  Jimmy was filming.  Jimmy's becoming a huge star out there.  He was filming for HBO, so we don't have Jimmy today.  We do have Patrice O'Neill. 
[00:08:30]  Maybe we bring Frank in for a sec.  Frank?  No.  No?  No.  You're putting your foot down?  I am.  For the listeners.  You're not going with this one?  For the listeners.  You get so many guys calling me an asshole because I'm like, I don't know.  That could be the angle at it.  We bring Frank in, and then he takes a beating.  Oh.  He seems very opinionated.  He seems like he knows his stuff.  Where do you live, Frank?  Hey, unfortunately, I'm on my way to work to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.  I'm going to be off.  See, he can't even make it, all right? 
[00:09:00]  You know what?  It's all right.  Monday morning.  Let's see what's happening Monday morning with you.  Oh, God.  All right.  Call us Monday morning early, and we'll make a split-second decision on that, all right?  I'll call you first thing in the morning, and you know what?  If you want me in, I'll call my boss and tell him I got in a car accident or something.  All right.  Right on, Frank.  Yeah, you do that.  All right, guys.  Listen.  Stay strong.  No tiger.  All right.  No tiger.  The tiger story is fascinating.  I was listening to Mad Dog yesterday.  Mad Dog or Just Mad Dog? 
[00:09:30]  Just Mad Dog.  And he was doing a great job with the whole tiger thing.  And he was pretty interesting.  Tiger Buds.  He was pretty interesting.  He said that you don't come back.  Tiger never comes back from this.  But then he said other guys can come back.  How do you think Tiger?  He said the way he was banging broads in his house, in his car, up against cars, pulling  out tampons, having sex next to the crib with the general public.  He doesn't come back to that status he had because of how he did it and how many broads 
[00:10:00]  he did.  He said, but you could cheat and come back from it.  Like a Kobe Bryant came back from it.  Right.  Because he only had one.  He thinks it's all wrong, but he says there's different degrees of it.  He was talking about that president of ours who was married to Eleanor.  And he is looked at as just a freaking great president.  And the fact is he had a girlfriend.  He says you could come back from that depending on what you do and how you did it and what 
[00:10:30]  kind of person you are in your professional life.  I guess you'll always have it hanging over your head.  Right.  But as far as coming back, I think Tiger's doing a pretty good job.  But what he means by coming back is like that whole image thing and all the sponsorships  and everyone like just putting him back up on a pedestal.  He says Tiger never comes back from this and comes close to where he was.  I don't know.  I don't agree with that.  We should get him on the phone.  I don't agree with that one. 
[00:11:00]  We should get him on the phone because it was a pretty good argument he was making yesterday.  And then they were going over all the guys and they're cheating ways like a Tiki Barber.  Yeah.  He says Tiki Barber doesn't come back from it because of the way he did it.  The way he did it was ditching his pregnant wife.  Eight months pregnant with twins.  Eight months pregnant with twins.  Bye bye.  And he's hanging out with a freaking intern.  Yeah.  And Mad Dog says that not only does Tiki Barber not come back from that, he says, I guarantee, 
[00:11:30]  this is Mad Dog talking, NBC is looking at his contract right now for some kind of clause  to get him the fuck out of there.  Oh my God, yeah.  He goes, you really think freaking NBC wants to deal with a Tiki Barber after what he did  to his eight month pregnant wife?  And it was the way he did it is what he's trying to explain.  I think Tiger comes back.  He'll always have that footnote of the time when he fucked around on his wife. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  But in five, ten years.  Well, he only has.  He probably has a solid ten.  He probably has a solid ten.  In five years, are people really going to, we're talking this is just months after it happened.  And he's back for the first time playing golf.  You can't really judge what's going to happen five years from now based on history as it's  being made.  You know, you need some hindsight on it.  But I don't know.  I think he comes back.  I think a lot of his sponsors come back. 
[00:12:30]  I think they market him as the, you know, that Tiger, the concentration, the fucking expertise,  that commitment kind of a thing, even though commitment's kind of an odd word.  But I mean, to the sport.  Right, right.  You know?  Well, then he's saying like the women out there will never forgive him.  He goes, I keep saying Mike.  Were they buying fucking Nikes?  Mad Dog goes.  Were they buying fucking pink clubs?  Or fucking.  Mad Dog goes, my wife will never like him again.  Most wives will never like him again.  But that was part of it, though. 
[00:13:00]  I mean, he did have some, you know, a bunch of females that really dug everything he did as well.  Girls that probably, like the Perkins waitress, would have fucked him anyway.  They just didn't fuck him so they don't like him.  Realizing that he was cheating on his wife.  Yeah.  And they didn't fuck those girls.  Yeah.  So they were all upset.  Yeah.  With him.  You know, did you see the, who is he?  The president of Augusta or the president of the PGA?  Oh, getting a little, giving a little tongue lashing.  Which is hilarious because if you know anything about Augusta, they only allowed blacks to play at that golf course very recently. 
[00:13:30]  And they had the women issue.  I mean, this guy is the biggest hypocrite.  He has his own issues that people are not happy with.  Yeah, why'd that change the rules?  I want to know.  And the guy comes out and he's like fucking beating up tigers.  Like, really?  Yeah.  You've had some problems yourself there, sir.  You need to apologize to the people you are role models to.  And you need to apologize. 
[00:14:00]  No, no.  Use the bathroom that says colored.  Yeah, exactly.  Use the bathroom that says colored over the door, please.  Could you?  That was happening until very recently at Augusta.  And I think the women are still not allowed.  But this guy is going to freaking beat up tiger.  Oh, it's me again.  Me again.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  Listen, with tiger five years from now, it's going to be like A-Rod.  He's on the show.  Okay.  You know, I love doing this to the listeners.  As soon as I know, they hate something.  You've got to keep going with it.  Steroids, steroids, steroids, right? 
[00:14:30]  What, Frank?  Yeah, exactly.  With A-Rod.  Yeah.  Last year, everybody's worried about A-Rod coming out with steroids, crying in the springtime.  Oh, I'm sorry what I did to my family, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Now he wins a championship with the Yankees.  Now everybody forgets about him.  A-Rod's going to be the next home run king, and he's gone again.  Same thing with Tiger Woods.  No, it's not the same thing.  That's what Mad Dog was arguing.  And I would love to get Mad Dog on the show today, because I really thought it was a great discussion he started yesterday.  That's what Mad Dog was trying to explain, that you can do some things, and they're going to forget about you. 
[00:15:00]  And all it takes is winning a championship or winning a big major golf tournament, and they forget about you.  But his whole point was Tiger did it so frequently with so many broads, and the way he did it that people never forget.  And his pre-fuck-up image has a lot to do with how you recover from your post-fuck-up image.  And I'm not saying Mad Dog's right.  I just thought it was a great angle on this whole thing, that you can come back from a lot of these controversies, but other times you can't. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, but guys, think about it.  Who are the main people watching golf?  Men.  Yeah, exactly.  Most of the guys are sitting there saying, man, I wish I could bang as many women as Tiger has.  Okay, so they're sitting there, and they're going to say, hey, look, he's going to come back.  I don't care what he did to his wife.  I don't care what he did with all these cocktail waitresses and everybody else.  I want to watch him playing golf.  True or not true?  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  You know what it would be like if you were sitting here, I'll be every two seconds going, true or not true?  Yeah.  True or not true?  That's why I want him in here. 
[00:16:00]  It's like a lawyer.  I want him in here bad.  Oh, God.  Start making believe you got a bad neck for Tuesday, because you're going to tell your boss on Monday you had a car accident.  No, no, no.  Believe me, bring me in.  I'm telling you.  Now he's taking my job.  That's great.  Now he's honing in on my fucking job.  I love somebody's voices.  There's Frank.  You'll have a lot of fun.  All right.  Get to work, Frank.  Jesus.  Fucking Frank.  You guys have a great day.  All right.  Punching out.  Yeah, but they pretty much did forget about A-Rod and his issues. 
[00:16:30]  That's true, right, Ant?  Being a Yankee fan.  But you never cared either.  I don't give a shit.  I didn't care.  I don't care if my athletes are on steroids.  I just don't give a shit.  Smack the long ball.  That's all I want to see.  That's fucking great.  Although Major League Baseball is scolding the Yankees and the Red Sox for taking so goddamn long with their baseball games.  Yeah.  Major League Baseball is saying, look, man, you can't have five-plus-hour games this early in the season.  But the thing is, those games, there were a lot of pitches being thrown early in the games, too. 
[00:17:00]  I think by the third inning, these pitches were 50 pitches in, some shit like that.  It's like, you know, what are you going to do if a batter is fouling off every other pitch?  You ever see some fucking batters?  They'll be standing up there for 10 minutes.  It's amazing.  Just fucking, hey, he fouled that one off, he fouled that one off, he fouled that one off.  And most of the time...  How do you slow that down?  Most of the time, too, they're just slapping at the ball.  Yeah, just slapping, knowing they're going to foul it off. 
[00:17:30]  So they draw the walk and get the fucking, you know, they get the high and outside pitch and take the walk.  But it's like, so they just try to keep the ball alive.  How do you slow that down?  I mean, speed that up.  I can understand if they were trying, which they were trying to do between the Yankees and Sox was keep down the meetings at the mound, shit like that.  The batter's just stepping out of the box and calling for a timeout.  A lot of time, the fucking home plate wasn't even acknowledging the batter. 
[00:18:00]  It's like, you better get back in there or it's going to be a fucking strike.  See, I keep thinking it's going to be a problem for baseball, but I know I'm in the minority.  I mean, people are coming out in droves already.  A quicker game would be a lot nicer.  I would love to see a quicker game.  It would be nice.  Would love it.  When we were growing up, two hours, two hours and 15 minutes.  When it started pushing two and a half, three hours, you're like, what the fuck is this about?  There are a lot of things they do now as far as commercial timeouts.  You know, they stop the fucking plate just to throw commercials in. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but why don't you get one of those old school announcers that worked those commercials in between pitches?  Yeah, yeah.  Remember that?  I used to love that one, yeah.  Yeah, and then the other thing is, you know, changing pitchers.  They never did that as much as they do now.  Right.  And you've got to get the guy warmed up.  He's got to get out there.  So as far as the game getting longer, there are ways to cut it down, but...  What do I know?  People are loving baseball.  I mean, the popularity...  And the big fans don't care.  Like, I'll sit and watch a fucking five-hour Yankee game. 
[00:19:00]  I don't care.  God bless you, man.  Because I'm doing other shit.  I'm online.  I'm fucking, you know.  Right, right.  All right.  Picture-in-picture if something else is on, like Lost was on when the Yankee game was on the other day.  You pip that motherfucker.  You sit there.  Something happens.  You know, or a commercial comes on on Lost.  Boom!  You flip the pip.  Flip the pip!  Why hasn't pip gotten better?  No one really uses pip, and it's been around a few years now.  I use it for situations like that.  Well, you have a TV that takes up an entire wall, so your pip looks good. 
[00:19:30]  Pip.  Other people's pips look horrible.  Pip.  I love that you said pip.  Let's say hi to Art in Ohio.  Art.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Art.  Hello.  I think that Mad Dog is absolutely wrong, okay?  He's probably influenced a bit by his wife feeling that way, but America loves train wrecks.  They'll follow him, whether it's John Daly making his mistakes.  He'll come back stronger. 
[00:20:00]  America's that way.  If Oswald came back, he'd be the mayor of Boston.  They wouldn't forgive.  But I think I know what Mad Dog was saying is the fact that, yeah, he could come back.  He could be more successful in golf and in endorsements than he ever was, even after the scandal.  But he's never going to come back to be that person that he was before this happened.  Like, he'll always have that scandal over his head.  Well, we live in two different worlds.  We've, I hate to tie ourselves to the story, but there's two things going on. 
[00:20:30]  And obviously, everybody's watching Tiger.  So if you're a sponsor, holy crap, you should be sponsoring Tiger Woods right now.  You're going to get your money's worth.  But then these big corporations, because we have dealt with this.  We've been fired having great ratings because we had some kind of controversy.  Right.  When we would argue to these sponsorships and stuff, hang in there.  We have so many more people listening to us now because of the controversy we did.  You're going to get your money's worth.  But there's an image thing in the corporate world that they deal with. 
[00:21:00]  It is, but they will forget, too.  I'm telling you, in five years, he'll get those sponsors back, or he'll get a new one.  He'll get them back sooner than that.  He wants to get attached to a winner.  He'll get them back sooner than that, believe me.  Yeah.  If he wins this, he'll get back fucking more sponsorships than he had.  But these corporations have to stop with the fake morality and stuff.  Oh, I know.  I mean, the shit they do to make dollars, trust me.  Trust me.  I think Tiger.  What their executives are doing in back rooms and at parties and the sexual harassment. 
[00:21:30]  You know how many of these fucking guys that are looking down on Tiger fucking had prostitutes  when they're flying to these corporate meetings and these corporate get-togethers?  Blowjobs at the Christmas party with the fucking secretary.  You know how many companies fire a lot of people right around Christmas just to make it hurt a little more?  They're scumbags.  But they're going to step in front of the public eye and make believe they've got some kind of morality?  Go fuck yourself. 
[00:22:00]  Tiger has changed.  He will not do that again.  And he will show everybody that he is a different man.  We'll see about that.  You know what?  It's kind of hard to pass up the pussy.  You know what?  My prediction is Elan goes and Tiger starts dating.  We'll just call it starts dating.  He does want to do that.  All the stuff that he did, he's not going to do that again.  He's on medication.  That's bullshit.  Changed the way he feels about that.  Changed the way he feels.  What kind of medication does it make you not want pussy? 
[00:22:30]  Right.  What the fuck?  Right.  A fucking...  Not the pussy.  It's his desire to just...  He needs something.  He needs fed.  I mean, that's what made him such a great player.  It makes anybody who is really, really up on their game, whether it's an artist, whether it's a musician,  you know, these guys aren't like you.  Maybe you guys.  That sex drive has got to be fed, man.  I'm telling you.  He wants pussy.  And he wants a lot of pussy.  And he hasn't changed.  And Elan, I guess, is really pissed because he went back to golf too soon, 
[00:23:00]  proving that he cares about golf way more than his wife.  Way the fuck more.  Which is fine.  Whatever.  If that's what he's into.  But, you know, stop making believe you're trying to work it out with your wife as you quickly go back to golf.  She's probably glad he went back to golf.  For one, you know, he's out of the house.  But secondly, he's back making money.  They don't need money.  Anyhow, I'll check it out, guys.  Thank you.  Why don't you do that?  All right, brother.  Okay, brother.  Let's go to Matt on Long Island.  Matt? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, oh, how come you bash a five-hour baseball game,  but you guys sit around and do a five-hour show every day?  Can you speed it up a little bit?  Whoa, Matt.  Speed it up.  First of all, great phone call.  I like how you're thinking.  I honestly think that this show should be a lot shorter.  It's a different world.  But these talk shows evolved because it was all music guys doing four-hour shifts,  and then all of a sudden the boss is like, well, why don't you start talking a little more?  And then it had to fit into a four-hour shift for Arbitron ratings. 
[00:24:00]  I mean, I could go real deep with this.  That's the only reason you hear four-hour talk shows.  Four-hour talk shows are insane.  It is.  And it's not going to change anytime soon.  I could yell and scream all I want.  This show will always be four-plus hours because that's what they want.  And it's stupid.  It waters down the product.  A good solid talk show would be three hours.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  And now everyone's going to be like, oh, you just want to work less, da-da-da-da-da.  No, man.  No, that's just part of it.  It's not easy filling up a four-and-a-half-hour show every day. 
[00:24:30]  It's just not.  Four-and-a-half hours is really crazy when you think about it for a talk show.  You know, music show, fine.  Jock gets up there.  He could spin some records, talk in between them, whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  But to just sit and talk about stuff for four-and-a-half hours is a little crazy when you really think about it.  And there's no innovators in radio whatsoever.  I mean, there's a bunch of guys down the hall who think they're innovating stuff.  They're really not.  They're too scared to change. 
[00:25:00]  I mean, you need someone to come in here with some new ideas, and they would realize, wow, you know what?  If we cut down these shows, I think we would get a better quality show.  Nope.  No.  Ain't happening.  Thank you, Matt.  See you.  All right.  See you.  Let's go to Brian in Boston.  Brian.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, fellas.  How are you doing?  Good, man.  Listen, some of the things you said before, I think one thing Anthony said, he said something about Tiger's image.  Unfortunately, Tiger's image was a lie to begin with. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, well, of course.  Most people's image is a lie, my friend.  Absolutely.  They're saying, you know, if it's, what's his name?  The Mad Dog.  If Mad Dog's saying that, you know, he can't get his image back or whatever it is, he can't get his image back because it was a lie to begin with.  You know what?  You make a good point because a lot of the media is saying, you know, Tiger tried to get his image back.  And, yeah, you know, if you break it down, he was never that guy.  That was bullshit.  It was always bullshit.  Yes. 
[00:26:00]  From the first time we saw Tiger with his Nike cap, we thought he was like that guy you wanted to tussle his hair, like, oh, come here, Tiger.  But he was a dirty, dirty boy from day one.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  And, you know, Elaine just got, what was it, $80 million from Tiger?  I mean, $80 million.  She should leave and laugh at him when she watches a golf tournament four years from now and says, look, there's my ex-husband who's still paying me every month because, you know, he fucked around.  How nice is that?  The smart one there is really, Elaine, you know.  Yeah.  There you go. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  No, it's not true.  Right on, brother.  I wish I had a pussy and I wish I was Elaine because I'd be laughing all the way to the bank.  Yeah.  She's got it pretty easy.  No, it's not true, really.  And then she'll move on and find true love out there.  She'll have a fine life.  She'll be just fine.  Oh, I'd love to find true love with Elaine, believe you.  Yeah.  That marriage is so done, though.  It's just a matter of time now.  You know about the five-hour radio show?  You know, the nice thing about a five-hour radio show, I can sit and listen to you guys for five hours.  You know, there's all the people out here, they want to sit and listen to just mindless shit sometimes. 
[00:27:00]  And, you know, you guys have a little bit of mindless shit, but it's fun to listen to.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  I mean, you know, I'm not going to bitch.  We have a great job, but it's not.  Certainly do.  It's hard to fill up a four, four-and-a-half-hour show every day.  That's why you don't see a lot of guys doing a talk show, you know?  I mean, even like the, how many hours does Rush Limbaugh do?  Does he do four?  I don't know.  He does too many.  You listen to that fat airbag, you know.  But I don't think it's four, is it?  I don't think it.  I mean, I think the political talk show guys, I don't think they're doing four hours a day. 
[00:27:30]  They are, though, or something?  I'm not even sure.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, Sean Hannity, I think, does three hours, and then he has a show at night.  Yeah, I agree.  And people are just Sean Hannity fans, you know what I mean?  Yeah, but he does, yeah, he does a TV show and writes books.  Yeah.  Well, we would have time.  We would have time to do other things.  I know.  Hey, guys, just to show you the voices, this is Frankie again from Jersey.  You suck.  Is it really?  Yeah, I suck.  Yeah, it is.  You know, I wasn't going to say anything, but no, no, I didn't know it was you. 
[00:28:00]  I wasn't going to say anything like that, but I was going to say that, wow, there really  seems to be a type of caller that is calling today.  And I keep thinking the phones are broken because they keep talking over us, but that's  just Frank.  Yeah.  That's just Frank.  So you're not Brian in Boston, you're Frank from Jersey again?  Frank from Jersey again.  All right, we got to get this guy in.  I hope you work in a fucking steel plant and something falls on you. 
[00:28:30]  We had...  Hey, you know what I do?  I work in a big corporate cafeteria and I get to deal with shitheads all day and I  get to put a facade...  Believe me, I know...  That's what people say when they walk into the cafeteria.  Well, it's a big one.  Nice.  700 people in the building.  So I sit there and I got to smile and, hey, how are you this morning?  And under my breath, you fucking asshole, I hope you get sick on the food.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, fellas, I'm punching out.  Take care.  Have a great day.  All right.  Hopefully that's it for Frank.  It's like Pesci's brother in Casino spitting in the sandwiches.  Yeah.  You fucking prick.  Yeah, well, we can continue with Tiger as the show goes on. 
[00:29:00]  I hope we can get Mad Dog on because I'm not doing his...  Maybe later, yeah.  I'm not doing his thing justice, but...  I want to hear his...  Yeah.  His take on the whole thing.  His take on it because I don't necessarily agree.  You think everybody comes back, all the sponsors, or people on...  All the sponsors come back.  I think...  People will replace the ones that don't want to come back.  Look at the...  It's his first fucking time out of the box, out of the box, playing golf after this controversy.  Right.  And he was fucking, like, adored on the course. 
[00:29:30]  And you know what?  The fans were all there cheering him on.  Just one more thought and we can move on.  So you got corporations that, you know, they want to be moral.  They have this morality, right?  So the ratings have got to be ridiculous.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to watch.  So you got to think a ton of people are advertising to get their spot on the Masters coverage.  Yeah.  Where's the morality? 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  Where's this morality?  The reason everyone's watching is because of Tiger.  Ah, well...  Right?  We can't advertise with Tiger Woods, but...  Someone should make a list of all the sponsorships that we'll be advertising in the next three  days as the Masters continue.  Where's the morality?  Are you saying the corporate world doesn't have morality, man?  They'll make sure they get their commercials because they know that's a great spot to be  this weekend, right?  A couple of planes have flyovers.  So it's all bullshit, yeah.  With the banners, though. 
[00:30:30]  A hack, though.  Chilling behind them.  I know.  Hack.  What's this one?  That one says sex addict?  Yeah, right.  Sure.  Me too.  That one actually is better than...  What was the other one?  Bootylicious?  Yeah, something like...  That was kind of hack.  It was like a Buddha trying to tie in Buddha.  Don't you mean booty-ism?  Yeah, yeah.  Booty-ism.  Oh, booty-ism.  Right, right.  Instead of...  Buddhism.  That's like a joke that somebody would tweet you after you heard it 50 fucking times.  Right.  Like, oh, yeah.  Got that one already.  Who's taking responsibility for the banners? 
[00:31:00]  Anyone know?  Because there was no logo or anything.  Freddy Couples.  Does anyone know?  So you fly a banner, and you don't even...  And there's just nothing.  You just do it so you can go to your friends.  Hey, you see my banner?  It's got to be somebody.  It's got to be...  It's got to...  You know what?  It's probably a dopey radio station.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Somewhere in fucking Georgia.  Hey, just see our...  Although they are big with signage.  They would have been like a...  Yeah, they would have had call letters.  They'd have the call letters on there next time. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Maybe they'll do it every day.  And then the last day of the Masters, they'll fly it with the big call letters, and the jock  will be in the plane.  I'm broadcasting live from the plane, and we're throwing bras with water balloons on.  All right, all right.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  Shut up with the bras.  Yeah, because why wouldn't they take responsibility unless maybe they're going to be doing more?  The big reveal.  They are doing more.  The company that runs the planes, they won't say who did them, but they said that there's 
[00:32:00]  plans to run more all weekend.  So why aren't they telling who it is?  Yeah.  I don't know.  They probably can't.  Yeah.  Confidentiality.  What is there?  Some kind of fucking...  Is there a banner fucking plane client confidentiality?  Yeah, but if it's a company or a sponsor, they're going to want to get their name out because  we're all talking about it.  Yeah.  I bet they'd have the big reveal at the end.  You think?  Yeah, and I bet it is stupid radio station.  You think it's a stupid radio station?  Stupid radio station.  I think it's going to be like GoDaddy or what's the other one? 
[00:32:30]  You think?  Like a dot com?  Golden Palace.  A dot cam?  It's going to be a dot cam.  They'd come up with better fucking jokes or something.  You'd think they could come up with better lines, though.  Well, that's why it leans toward maybe a wacky morning show.  Yeah, it just sounds like horrid morning show stuff.  And then that morning show will get publicity for two days.  And then guess what?  No one listens to the morning show after it's done because they'll pat each other on the  back.  Hey, what a great one.  Did you see the exposure we got?  Right.  Because you still need to have a really good show. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of people will tune in for like a day.  Hey, who are these guys?  These are the guys that flew the banner and stuff.  And I saw them.  Wow, this sucks.  Right.  Oh, someone's saying it's W...  Oh, it's Kevin from Connecticut.  It's W-O-O-D-F-M.  What's going on with your iPhone, Ant?  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  They had the big reveal for their latest, what?  Yeah, Steve Jobs came out. 
[00:33:30]  Their latest upgrade they're going to have in the summer?  Steve Jobs came out, did his little keynote in front of people that are forced to applaud  certain parts.  It's just so funny.  When Steve Jobs comes out there and starts talking about things that the iPhone's going  to get, this is OS 4 coming out for the iPhone.  And he goes, and I'm going to tell you seven important things that are going to be happening  with the new iPhone upgrade.  Tentpoles.  Why? 
[00:34:00]  Tentpoles.  See, there's over a hundred things that are going to be new with the OS 4 for the iPhone.  But he goes, we're just going to concentrate on seven, which we call the tentpoles.  Tentpoles.  The what?  Tentpoles.  Is that some corporate douche talk?  It sounds to me like when I saw it, I was douche chilling at the pure corporate bullshit.  Like, what dumb suit made up like, these are the tentpole additions to OS 4.  And then there's the other ones that, you know, they're under the tent. 
[00:34:30]  Did they blue sky this?  I think they blue sky it.  After they let it bake for a while?  And green lit it.  They green lit, blue skied, and these were the tentpoles.  Didn't Elo also talk about buckets?  Yeah, yeah.  What were the buckets?  B-Lo and his stupid buckets.  Really?  Oh, he's probably over there with Oprah talking about buckets and blue skying.  As Elo's career is taking off.  Oh, I know.  Maybe there's something to be said about fucking corporate douche talk.  That prick.  You got two buckets.  And this bucket you got.  Shit.  Really?  And the bucket is filling up. 
[00:35:00]  And what?  What?  Shut up.  Put your bucket in your corporate bullshit.  Anyway, sorry.  Tentpoles.  Yeah, tentpoles.  Oh, my God.  The biggest thing about the new OS.  But what's a tentpole?  Tentpoles are like the seven real important big items.  The big show items.  I get it.  But why do they have to say tentpole?  What is that based on?  Because I guess those are the poles that hold up the tent, and then all the other hundred  things are in the tent.  So they call them the tentpoles.  That's all I can imagine it is. 
[00:35:30]  Yes, exactly.  Shut up, you dumb corporate fucks.  The big thing?  Multitasking coming to the iPhone.  Now you can fire up Pandora or, you know, hey, SiriusXM.  And then let it run in the background.  And work with other apps.  And check your mail.  And do whatever the fuck else you want to do.  I'm confused by this iPhone.  Because on my BlackBerry, I could do that.  Because yesterday, I had a lot of fucking chores to do. 
[00:36:00]  So I actually was listening to the Masters on my SiriusXM app for the BlackBerry.  And you knocked that in the background.  And then I'm tweeting and fucking emailing.  Let me explain something to you, Opie.  Yeah.  You know, Steve Jobs and Apple and the iPhone, they might be late to the party when it comes  to multitasking.  But they're going to do it better.  And more efficient.  You believe that?  Than BlackBerry or anybody else.  Because they took so much time to work out power management and CPU management. 
[00:36:30]  Now, a lot of people can multitask on their various smartphones.  But at the cost of battery power and at the cost of sluggish performance on the other apps  you're running.  Now, what we've done here at Apple is...  You're not weak.  You're not...  Oh, sorry.  I was just reciting Steve Jobs.  That's exactly what he was saying, though.  See, they've worked on it so long that they figured out a way to maximize battery power and stuff. 
[00:37:00]  He sounds like a czar.  He really does.  Like a Russian czar.  And then he goes, so...  And when he goes, so, this is great.  This is multitasking.  And then everybody's got a...  Oh!  Harumph!  Harumph!  I didn't get a harumph out of you.  Yeah, yeah.  Harumph!  Harumph!  No, harumph!  They have to harumph.  Very good.  So, that's a biggie.  That's a biggie.  And then a lot of new features with email.  A lot of new features with...  There's a lot of personalization you can do with the location features. 
[00:37:30]  I suggest if you have an iPhone and you are interested, you go to Apple.com and just check  out the keynote thing.  Slide through the beginning of it with the iPad stuff.  Who gives a flying fuck?  Apparently half a million people.  Well, they're selling a lot of iPads.  Yeah, they certainly are.  But I'm psyched for it.  So, it's not just a quick, you know, plug it in, update it, and then you walk away and  pretty much have the same thing with a couple of new features.  Whereas, this looks to be a major upgrade to the OS. 
[00:38:00]  Well, I have one very important question.  Yes, sir.  I'm a huge paper toss guy.  Will this help my paper tossing game?  Let me think.  Do I have to buy another phone just to play paper toss?  Now you can run SiriusXM and listen to some music.  You want to put on lithium?  You want to put on whatever channel you like?  Yeah, yeah.  You can listen to that while you're playing paper toss.  Now, you couldn't do that.  That would mean using my iPhone for more than one thing. 
[00:38:30]  See, I have an iPhone.  It's a known fact that I have an iPhone.  You didn't need multitasking.  No.  I have an iPhone that sits.  It's a paperweight.  It does two things.  Oh, okay.  So, you do multitask.  It's paperweight.  I also play paper toss.  And you know what?  This isn't a bit for the radio.  I do exactly that.  Yes.  I turn on my iPhone when I'm feeling the itch to play a little paper toss.  It's a paper toss gaming system.  Well, one thing you will be able to do.  Because SiriusXM gave me an iPhone.  That was very nice of them because they really thought they were going to turn me on to the iPhone.  I would ditch the BlackBerry. 
[00:39:00]  And then I discovered paper toss and it's all over.  I just have a problem with calling it an iPhone.  You should just call it a Game & Watch because that's pretty much what you have.  Nice.  You have a Game & Watch.  It just tells the time.  But I don't even use it for the time thing.  I'm telling you.  I use it for one thing.  Just paper toss and paperweight.  Well, and the paperweight is just because it's there and I put it on something.  It's something called Game & Watch.  That's the Game & Watch, huh?  Yes.  The old Nintendo before the consoles, before Game Boy. 
[00:39:30]  It was the Nintendo Game & Watch.  Stephen S. says now I can multi-toss.  Yes, multi-toss.  All right.  Well, here's something you could do.  If you did find another game, let's say, that you liked playing.  That ain't happening.  Crazy.  That ain't happening.  Let's say somebody out there had two apps.  Okay.  You could drag one app on top of another app and it becomes a folder.  So now where you're going, you're flicking through pages and pages. 
[00:40:00]  If you look at my iPhone here.  Let me demonstrate to Opie here.  If you look at my apps, there's just pages.  Holy shit.  How many apps do you have?  I don't know.  I got like six.  That was four or five pages.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  I have eight pages.  On the eighth page, I have three apps.  So I have eight pages of apps.  Now with the new thing, I'll be able to, let's say, take all my games and drag and drop on top of each other.  Right.  And it will form a folder that is holding my games.  You have 26 apps, by the way.  26 apps? 
[00:40:30]  I'm a rain man.  Really?  Count.  One, two, three, four.  No, I have more than that.  How many pages?  One, two, I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight pages of apps.  And how many on a page?  With four by four, so.  Oh, 16.  16.  Yeah, I was way off.  It's a lot of apps.  I guess you could fit 180 apps now on this.  And it will make, it'll get to the point now with folders where you can fit over 2,000 apps on there.  And in categories, so you could do them by social networking, let's say. 
[00:41:00]  You get your Facebook, you get your Twitter, you put them all in a folder.  Your games, some type of work applications, news applications, sports.  You could put them all in different folders.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Are you excited?  I'm very excited.  And you could put different wallpaper on your, uh, your, uh, back of your apps.  Are you still all in with the iPhone?  Are you drinking the Kool-Aid?  I am totally all in with the iPhone.  Now more than ever. 
[00:41:30]  Now more than ever.  Now it's just going to.  This is all they have to do.  Like, they release an update every year and we all just go stupid over it.  Because now the only thing missing is Flash, which I know, you know, as Travis pointed out in his tweet last night, uh, this isn't going to happen.  He's, uh, during the Q&A after, after the thing, somebody said, is there going to be Flash?  And all Steve Jobs said was, no.  No.  Flash would, Flash would cripple the app store, in my opinion.  You think so, yeah?  Well, I think a lot of the revenue stream comes from things like, you know, like TV shows on iTunes and, you know, casual gaming. 
[00:42:00]  And I think that those are two things that Flash takes care of very well for free.  Well.  When you can go to Hulu and just start watching television shows and, uh, you know, you know, Op has Paper Toss.  He, he, he paid for Paper Toss.  Now, if Flash was enabled on the iPhone, I could just go to a Flash gaming website and I could just play Paper Toss without ever buying the app.  You know something?  Uh, you bring up a good point right there.  Yeah.  And then there's, you know, and then Apple doesn't get revenue from, uh, you know, from buying an app in the app store. 
[00:42:30]  So, it's in their best interest to not ever have Flash.  You're right.  It will never, ever, ever, ever, ever be Flash on the iPhone.  That's a really good point.  God damn, look at Danny.  I like it.  Holy shit.  Uh, by the way, also, they are, uh, doing, uh, something that I didn't like, how they were presenting it like it's something good.  The app ads.  What's that?  These are going to be great.  Yeah, yeah.  The iAds.  There are going to be ads on your apps.  Now, now, let's say you punch up Paper Toss.  Right.  On the bottom, there could be a little ad for the latest, uh, new motion picture that's coming out.  That's fine. 
[00:43:00]  Or something.  And if you click on it, it will take you to that ad.  Sure.  Much like a pop-up ad or a sidebar ad.  I don't mind so far.  Um, and, but one thing good about it is you can click off of it and it will take you exactly back where you were.  You don't have to navigate back.  Right, right.  Like you do with a browser, you take, you take up exactly where you left off on your app.  Uh, but.  What's the bug?  The ads are going to be popping up on the bottom of your apps.  So you're going to be seeing these things and have to X out of them.  It's not, it's not a big hassle, but they're trying to sell it like it was such a good thing for the, uh, for the people that make the apps. 
[00:43:30]  Because now you put out a free app, you're going to get 60% of the revenues, uh, of, of these apps if you're a developer.  What's the number two phone?  Is it the BlackBerry?  Does anyone know?  They had that stat.  Yeah, I think it is the BlackBerry.  Is it the BlackBerry?  Yeah.  But this is now just going to blow.  The multitasking was such a huge thing because people wanted to be able to listen to music while you're, you're doing something. 
[00:44:00]  You plug in your earbuds.  You really couldn't do that?  That's crazy.  Because I've been able to do that for a while with the BlackBerry.  I was able to, I could check mail, can't I?  I was like.  No, there's like, there's ways around it.  I remember I was doing a few things.  I was texting or something.  You got jailbreak that shit.  You were probably listening to your iPod.  I was listening to my iPod is what I was doing.  You're right.  I was listening to my iPod.  I'm bored with my BlackBerry.  I'm hoping we get a new BlackBerry soon.  Yeah, good luck.  With some upgrades.  They try to make it seem cool, the BlackBerry and the fucking Droid and everything else. 
[00:44:30]  And I'm just going, what are you talking about?  What are you doing?  Get a fucking iPhone.  I remember it seemed like yesterday you had that dumb phone that just, you were so excited because you could watch TV as you walked down the sidewalk.  That was my big phone, man.  I remember when I first started working here, Ope couldn't stop talking about his pebble.  And how it was the coolest phone.  And at the time it was.  He's like, I got the pebble, man.  You got to get the pebble.  And all it did was text.  That's all it did.  And that was four years ago.  Maybe some primitive video watching or whatever. 
[00:45:00]  But I remember coming in like, check it out.  Check it out.  Let's take it over the world.  D-Boy started a trend around here.  He came in one day with the Motorola Q when it first came out.  It was like, I mean, in Motorola's credit, like that was really the first mainstream smartphone.  I mean, most people had it for business and stuff.  And that phone was the first time I started seeing smartphones in the hands of just everyday people just hanging out.  And boy, was that one of the worst fucking phones I've ever had in my entire life.  It exploded. 
[00:45:30]  I was looking at some old pictures when we did the press conference for XM when we came back to radio.  Yeah.  And I'm looking at a trio with a big fat antenna.  But it was a short, short, short.  Yeah, yeah.  The little antennas.  And I'm like, oh my God, that seems like yesterday.  They were big like Palm Pilot-y looking things that were too big and bulky.  Now it's, you know, nice and small.  Except for the Q.  The Q was actually thin.  It was small.  It was light.  It just sucked a dick.  But it sucked.  And they're not selling it anymore? 
[00:46:00]  It was on Windows Mobile.  Yeah, oh man.  Windows Mobile is not a fun operating system.  What happened to it?  No, I hate Windows Mobile.  What happened to the Q?  WAP for me.  Are they still selling them?  I'm sure there's some version of it out there that's probably...  Yeah, my buddy still has one.  And I'm just like, what are you doing?  Somebody's saying that BlackBerry is the number one device.  But that's because probably a lot of companies are handing out the BlackBerry.  No, it's...  Well, do we have a stat on this?  What's the number one smartphone?  As of the fourth quarter of 2009, the BlackBerry Curve was still the number one selling smartphone. 
[00:46:30]  In second place was the Apple iPhone 3GS, then the Motorola Droid, and then still the second iPhone 3GS.  Talk about the Droid, man.  More and more talk about the Droid.  Oh, the Droid.  What's going on with the Droid?  Let's say hi to Steve in Philly.  Steve.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I love this conversation because you have Anthony who's trying to explain the versatility of the upgrades in the iPod.  You have Danny and Travis going all deep about why there will never be Flash in the iPod. 
[00:47:00]  I don't know where he's going.  Whatever it is.  And then you have...  They try to tie it all in to keep Opie in the conversation with paper toss.  With what?  Just paper toss game.  I have to keep going back to paper toss to get Opie's attention.  And then also I peek up like, ooh, what?  Paper toss?  So what can I do with the paper toss?  Paper toss?  Look, I never bought into the iPhone thing.  I just didn't.  I've had a couple iPhones that have been handed to me.  I just don't want to change from a BlackBerry.  I don't know one person that has it that doesn't just realize it's an amazing, amazing item. 
[00:47:30]  It's a computer that you put in your fucking pocket.  I was at a crossroads where I could easily win iPhone and the pictures on it sucked.  I know it's gotten better, but when I was at that where I had an iPhone and a BlackBerry  in my hand and I tried them both, I'm like, oh my God, the BlackBerry takes way better  pictures.  I know it's a lot closer now, but that's why I never changed. 
[00:48:00]  And the video on the BlackBerry is almost there.  You were way ahead.  Yeah, about a year ago.  Because I've been keeping track.  A year ago, you were way ahead on the video.  Your video on your iPhone was way better than the video on my BlackBerry than I upgraded,  and now it's definitely comparable again.  Definitely.  Yeah.  So, well, you always get these phone calls.  You got Frank in Brooklyn.  Frank.  Anthony, look up the HTC HD2 from T-Mobile.  That's a cool spot.  It destroys the iPhone.  Yeah.  Real nice.  It's going to destroy the iPhone. 
[00:48:30]  Is this the iPhone killer?  Is it the newest iPhone killer?  It's not going to destroy the iPhone, but it's real nice.  4.3-inch screen.  It's got a one-gigar processor.  The only downside is it's got Windows Mobile, but you can customize that.  You can tweak it, customize it.  Windows Mobile.  I don't care what the fuck.  It sucks a dick.  I don't want to have to tweak something on a phone.  I just want to have a phone and have it do what it's supposed to do well, like it's advertised.  And why is this phone so much better than the iPhone? 
[00:49:00]  Because, like I said, it has a huge 4.3-inch screen, which is way bigger than the iPhone.  Yeah, well, then it's a bigger fucking item.  But it's real thin.  It's, like, thinner than the iPhone, but it's bigger than the iPhone.  It's got the 5-megapixel camera.  It's got the autofocus.  It's got the gigahertz processor.  It's got a gig of RAM.  It's way more powerful than the iPhone is.  And you can do all the stuff that the iPhone can't even do yet, like multi-field. 
[00:49:30]  We're all cheering multitasking, something you should have been able to do years ago.  Well, they figured it out.  They took them time to figure out power management and CPU management.  Look it up.  I see it.  I'm looking at a picture of it right now.  Wow.  Whoop-de-doo.  Doesn't that look like a nice phone?  It looks like a big fucking too big a phone.  Why don't I just get an iPad and carry that around?  It's got great processor, fucking great video on it.  It's amazing.  That's too big, dude.  I'll just carry that in the back of my pants. 
[00:50:00]  It's a great phone that I happen to be talking on to you right now.  Oh, shit.  And it sounds crystal clear.  Frank, it sounds crystal clear, my friend.  Of course it does.  Can I get paper toss?  Yes.  As a matter of fact, yes, it does, Opie.  I'll make sure you get it.  I'm buying one today.  There you go.  See you, boys.  All right.  Thank you, Frank.  Let's say hi to Josh in Boston.  Target smartphones right now.  Josh.  Hello, boys.  Later, Josh.  Droids are screwed. 
[00:50:30]  Apple has about 16 lawsuits against them for patent infringement.  Is that true?  Of all kinds of functionality.  Yikes.  Anyone know that?  Is that true?  Yeah.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it.  You know, fuck that Ian Halpern, by the way.  Let me tell you something.  This guy was on our show two days ago, right?  Yep.  There's a big story coming out today.  Ian Halpern claims that Jesse James used Sandra Bullock's credit card to pay for hookers.  Yeah.  Why didn't he break that on our program? 
[00:51:00]  He breaks all the good stuff after he talks to us.  I know.  We're going to have to have a talking to this Ian Halpern.  Google it.  All right.  So we got, what, 17 patent infringements?  Is he gone?  Yeah.  Something like that.  If you look at some of them are cheesy, like the thumb sliding across.  But they ripped it off, so Apple's going after them.  All right, man.  Thank you.  I don't see any news stories on it.  Let's go to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff? 
[00:51:30]  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, buddy.  Listen, at the end of the day, you take a poll of all the teenage girls out there.  It's going to be iPhones and, like, you know, Palm Pixies.  But for anybody who really wants, like, a real man who wants a BlackBerry, they want the performance of a BlackBerry, and they want all the power that's behind it.  Shut the fuck up, BlackBerry.  BlackBerry's the corporate phone.  That's so they could fucking keep track of your emails and everything else.  You know what?  There wouldn't be that many BlackBerrys out there if companies didn't just hand them out to their employees. 
[00:52:00]  Believe me.  I know people that have BlackBerrys for fucking work and then went out and bought their own iPhones.  Yeah, you see a lot of that in the business world.  What do they say?  This is for work.  This is for pleasure.  Yeah.  I think Elo used to have that line.  My BlackBerry's for work, and this is for pleasure, my iPhone.  Look, all I know is...  Companies aren't handing out the iPhones?  Not as much?  Not as much, no.  Yeah.  Not so much. 
[00:52:30]  Jeff, you get these small, I guess, places with just a few employees that are like,  Yeah, man, we're going to all have iPhones, man.  We work for a groovy company, man.  But, you know, the hardcore corporate, we have 10,000 employees.  Right.  Dole out the fucking BlackBerrys.  That's another thing in the update is they're making a lot of changes to how corporations use it.  Yes, I saw that, too.  Oh, yes.  Empire.  Enterprise, they call it.  Enterprise.  Yes, Enterprise.  Whoa, am I looking at a new BlackBerry?  What?  Come on, Danny.  What do you got? 
[00:53:00]  Well, this is the fantastic Storm 2.  And it should just tell you when the new phones look like the iPhone.  No.  When the new phones look like an iPhone.  No.  How do you say that the iPhone sucks?  See, my cell phone provider, I go to this one guy up there on Columbus Avenue, I try to get the Storm, he goes, don't fucking buy this thing.  So now they got Storm 2, so they're trying to say they've worked out all the bugs?  Storm 2 is a heretic.  Most people hate the Storm.  I told you.  No, I got to tell you, I got the Storm 2, and I absolutely love it. 
[00:53:30]  The Storm 1 was bullshit, but the Storm 2, they really did work out the cakes.  And if you like, you know, the feel of the iPhone, but you want a little more power, the capability with emails, the different productivity, plus the camera, plus the multimedia functions, Storm 2 is awesome.  Well, I'll go to my guy, I'll get the real deal on this, because the guy's never, well, a cell phone guy, not lying to me.  You will play with the Storm 2, and you will hate its guts.  I had the Storm, the first Storm, for about, maybe, I think it lasted about a week. 
[00:54:00]  And then I was trying to take a picture with it, and it would just do, like, the focus and make like it was going to take, and then it wouldn't take the picture.  So I did that about three or four times.  I got so fed up, I just started, I just held it in my hand and just started punching the goddamn thing until the screen flew off, and I was like, I'm done with this fucking phone.  That's great.  Hey, Jeff.  I recommend the Storm 2, fellas, BlackBerry for life.  All right, but Jeff, you missed it.  No, you can't punch it out, because you missed your other point you wanted to make.  You said iPhone is for teenage girls, BlackBerry is for grown men. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, absolutely.  All right?  Well, that's why Anthony's got the iPhone.  Hey, look what I got.  Right.  You want one?  Hey, look what app I have.  Do you have this app?  Check this app.  Oh, wait a minute.  I've somehow ended up in photos.  Look at this one.  Spike cock.  It's all about, like, playing with the new app of the day, and the apps never make any sense.  They're good for, like, the first minute or two, and then you're like, why the hell do I even download the stupid app?  For the shitter. 
[00:55:00]  But you don't do that with your BlackBerry.  You download apps on the BlackBerry app store that you use on a daily basis, right?  No, I do.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't download apps on the BlackBerry.  But I think that, at the end of the day, there's a major difference between what the BlackBerry allows me to do and what the iPhone allows me to do.  Give some real-world examples, because all you've done so far is just say that.  So what are some real examples of how the BlackBerry is a better functionality tool than the iPhone?  I'm a whack job.  I'm real OCD.  So, for example, I have about 11 different email accounts, and I push all 11 to my BlackBerry. 
[00:55:30]  And as you know, from the BlackBerry, the email drops instantaneously.  So as soon as I get an inbound email, it's right there.  And I can integrate it with things like my Gmail and accountants.  And you can do that with the iPhone, too.  Yes, you can do that with the iPhone.  And with the upgrade, you're going to be able to link accounts, and your inbox can be the inbox of multiple accounts.  Yeah, they're calling it a unified inbox.  It's just going to be fantastic. 
[00:56:00]  And they will have that feature where you can click on an email, and then you'll see a number.  Threaded messages.  How many, a threaded message, right, right, where you can now, by subject line, see, follow along with conversations.  To be honest, that's something I used to hate about the goddamn BlackBerry is because if you had an email chain running, you know, back and forth for like a day or two, and you wanted to find the first message, I mean, you either had to scroll, scroll, scroll.  Scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll.  Or, you know, search.  And, you know, threaded messaging is definitely where it's at.  I mean, tell me this.  If the iPhone sucks so much and didn't innovate the mobile device community, tell me why all of the instant messaging apps that you could get for your BlackBerry makes it look like an iPhone. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  No, there's no question the popularity of the iPhone.  No, I'm not talking about the popularity of the iPhone.  I'm talking about the functionality of the iPhone versus the BlackBerry.  No, it's apples and oranges because the BlackBerry.  No, it's apples and BlackBerry.  Yeah, really.  If you're going to use fruit, you might as well just stick with the names.  Yeah, stick with BlackBerry.  We're talking apples and BlackBerry here. 
[00:57:00]  All right.  But think about all the free solutions that come with the BlackBerry through Google, right?  So you have Google Mobile, Google Voice, Google Safe.  I love the passion people have for their smartphones.  All intended for the BlackBerry is amazing.  They take your contacts.  They take your emails.  You know what I mean?  It's not the passion.  It's just I just can't stand when people, they try to make points and they have nothing to back up the points with.  It's a passion.  Just back up a point.  People like what they like.  Yeah.  Because there's 10 phone calls now where everyone's talking about 10 different phones that are the best phones and everyone needs this phone. 
[00:57:30]  I mean, how many iPhone killers?  Everyone needs the droid.  As Steve had already.  Remember when he came in with his iPhone killer that had a stylus?  Yes, it's got a stylus.  Oh, did we make fun of his stylus?  It's great, my stylus.  All right.  The iPhone killer.  Thank you, Jeff.  All right.  We could argue about this all day long, but look at this.  All day long.  Look at this.  Verizon demanded that Apple put all this new stuff on the iPhone.  Apple has blocked everything having to do with Flash.  Yeah.  Windows' new phone is going to blow the iPhone away. 
[00:58:00]  Here they go.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, yeah.  HTC is the one with the lawsuit, not Droid.  iPhone is worried about power management because you can't take the battery out and put a new one in.  You need to check out the new Sprint phone.  It's awesome.  The Droid has 9,000 apps created for it last month alone.  Oh, yeah.  And I worked for Best Buy.  An Apple rep told me that in June, Verizon will have their own iPhone.  You hear that one?  In June, Verizon will have their own iPhone.  Who's the guy who has the scoop that no one else has? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  What is that?  All rumors and speculation.  I love it.  It's no big surprise that Verizon would totally suck dicks for an iPhone.  Yeah.  The guy who worked at the store told me it's coming.  I fucking love it, though, man.  The passion.  All right.  We should take a break.  Hey, are you trying to get Mad Dog on the show?  Mad Dog.  Wake his ass up.  He did.  Tell him if he wants to fucking talk to a real audience to get his ass out of bed and call  our fucking radio show.  I've got to be nice with that.  Look at our phones.  They're lit. 
[00:59:00]  Is his phone's lit?  Let's get him on the phone and promote his ass.  Okay.  Just keep calling him until he wakes up.  And also Ian Halpern so we can yell at that fuck face.  I did actually last night.  What the fuck is wrong with Ian?  I asked him how reliable his source was.  He said very.  And then I said...  When did this info come out?  After he talked to us?  Yeah.  Is that what he's saying?  All he wrote back was very reliable.  And then he wouldn't respond to any of my other messages, which were, are you available?  When can I get you? 
[00:59:30]  Because he's never at the same number.  He's always at a different phone number.  And he never responded.  He gave the scoop to somebody else.  That's terrific.  Thanks.  Everything we're doing for that guy lately.  We've got Patrice O'Neill coming in at 8.  Jimmy was filming for HBO all night long, so he won't be in.  We'll see him Monday, though.  And an old friend, Mike Birbiglia, is stopping by to say hi as well.  Why don't we take a quick break and we'll continue with some other shit.  Right, Ant?  Yes. 
[01:00:00]  There, everybody.  Malcolm McLaren, right?  Dead at the age of 64.  You're kidding me.  The king of punk.  Oh, yeah?  You weren't a big punk guy growing up, were you, Ant?  Nah, nah.  I saw those guys in high school.  I never really hung out with them.  I was a southern rock guy. 
[01:00:30]  And I wasn't into that punk scene.  No, not at all.  Not even like the Ramones or Sex Pistols, obviously.  No, that was for those freaks that wore safety pins in their nose.  They were weirdos.  I didn't like hanging out with them.  They were frightening.  I hung out with my friends in the woods and drank whiskey and smoked pot.  And listened to 38 Special.  Even before 38 Special.  Oh, really?  Listened to Molly Hatchet and Charlie Daniels and fucking... 
[01:01:00]  And the Outlaws and Foghatch.  The Outlaws?  The Outlaws.  Yeah.  You know.  After Greengrass and High Tides Forever, what else you got from them?  I don't know.  If it's the live version, that's the whole night.  Yeah.  You didn't need another song by them.  And you don't have to tell us what else they sang, because I really don't care today.  Don't care.  Don't care about that.  I watched a movie last night. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Law Abiding Citizen.  Who's in that?  That's the one with Jamie Foxx.  And, yeah, I know.  And Gerard Butler.  Wow, there's so many fucking buttons I could play for Jamie Foxx.  Well, I got a few here, too, but I'm in trouble.  I'm not a Jamie Foxx fan.  I am not either.  I really am not a Jamie Foxx fan.  And that's what kept me from watching the movie.  I don't care, but I don't like when he sings. 
[01:02:00]  I don't like when he's trying to be funny.  I just don't.  I don't like him.  Quite frankly, I don't like his radio show.  I think he's overrated in every aspect of his career.  I think he's gotten very lucky with that Charles movie.  I don't want to jump on the Howard thing because he's all about, you know.  He's got his own battle with him right now, I guess.  He's beating up Jamie, but you know what?  I don't really like the Jamie Foxx.  I don't get the big attraction there. 
[01:02:30]  And that's why I didn't watch the movie.  It's on demand, so I figured, ah, I'll watch it.  Gerard Butler's fucking cool as shit.  But you have to tell everybody that you watch everything.  Yes, I do.  Because it's confusing.  It's confusing that you're saying, I don't like Jamie Foxx, but you just watched a movie that he's in.  Yeah, I watch everything.  I just sit there and watch.  I watch a fuckload of television.  A lot of movies and crime shows.  That's my life.  Movies and crime shows. 
[01:03:00]  This was like, eh.  If it wasn't for Jamie Foxx, I would have liked the movie more.  That's what it is because every scene he had, and it was your typical, all right,  Jamie Foxx has the wife and the kid, and that's his vulnerability from the bad guy.  Wow, that story hasn't been done.  Oh, my God, right?  I was waiting, you know, at some point for the bad guy to be holding the wife hostage with a gun to her head.  What are you going to do now? 
[01:03:30]  You know, how about that scene?  It's been done a thousand times.  And then they shoot the hostage.  Shoot the hostage.  And then she goes, I can't believe you took that chance.  Yeah.  I could have been killed.  And then they're hugging.  And as they're hugging, a bad guy that you thought was killed earlier comes out of nowhere.  Right.  And somebody kills them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The end.  The double ending.  Yeah, the double ending.  Oh, I love the double ending.  Die Hard came up with the double ending.  That was definitely the double ending.  Was that the first movie that did the double ending that we know about?  Not the first, but that was like the popular one.  The one that really pushed it forward? 
[01:04:00]  Where, who was it?  Alexander Gudinov comes out of a...  That means that the filmmakers didn't have confidence in their ending.  So like, you know what?  We got to come up with a...  We need two endings.  We need a double ending.  Double ending.  People think it's over.  It's not over.  No.  Double ending.  Especially when they do the first ending 45 minutes into the film.  It's like, oh, really?  This ain't the ending.  Really?  I'm supposed to believe you made a 47-minute film?  I know this isn't the ending.  Right.  But there's a good revenge scene in that movie where I would have liked for them to show 
[01:04:30]  a little more of it, but Gerard Butler, you know, his family gets killed.  You know that.  It's not a spoiler.  That's all the basis of the movie.  Right.  And apparently some legal wrangling gets the guy that did it off the hook with a pretty  short jail term.  And he works out a whole plan, like for over 10 years, to get revenge on everybody.  Oh, that sounds cool.  That's what the movie's about. 
[01:05:00]  And yeah, that was pretty cool.  I'm in the middle of my 10-year plan.  Are you in the middle of your 10-year revenge plan?  Oh, fuck yeah, I am.  10-year revenge.  I got five to go.  Shit.  That sounds like a good concept.  Yeah, yeah, he takes the guy to a warehouse and just does, you know, horrible Dexter-like  things to him.  Yeah.  So I thought that was pretty cool.  And then there's another, I actually at one point went like, holy shit.  Really?  Yeah, there was a holy shit moment. 
[01:05:30]  Maybe I got to check this movie out.  It wasn't bad.  It's on demand.  I figured I'll pop it on.  I was actually thinking of going to see Date Night.  Oh, yeah?  I guess I'm the one that's got to say it.  What?  I hate Steve Carell.  Yeah?  I really do.  I liked him in the first couple seasons of The Office.  I don't like this Steve Carell.  I'm not digging the Steve Carell.  Tina Fey is a funny broad. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah?  That 30 Rock is a great show.  But I don't know.  Whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The unrated version on Blu-ray, much more graphic.  Way more graphic.  The torture scene?  Way more graphic.  You might have to check that out.  Yeah.  Like, you actually, I don't want to give away too much, but you actually see.  See more of the revenge parts.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, great.  Okay.  I'll have to check that out.  Fine.  That's good to know.  Nice.  Although Date Night's getting a good review. 
[01:06:30]  67%.  Oh.  No desire.  Yeah?  No desire.  You don't watch 30 Rock, right?  Uh, no.  Don't watch 30 Rock.  I don't watch a lot of your standard programming.  I watch Lost.  I watch Seinfeld reruns, which I have all of them on DVD, but insist on watching the television.  But it's like, I go like, oh, Seinfeld's on.  But meanwhile, I could grab any fucking episode, any disc I want.  Because it makes you feel better to know if someone else is watching.  Someone else is watching, too.  Is that one?  I think that's what that's about. 
[01:07:00]  Because we were brought up in a world where you know other people are watching the same  show at the exact same time.  And then you have that collective experience the next day where you go, you know, hey,  Seinfeld.  Hey, yeah, he's on.  And when you watch DVD, you're the only one watching that episode at that time, maybe.  These kids coming up today, they don't understand that.  Because they can watch it on demand.  Everything is on demand.  Yes.  You know what else I think of it?  I think that's why we do that.  It's like, you know, just someone else out there is laughing at the same fucking jokes  at the same time.  Sharing an experience. 
[01:07:30]  Yes, Trav?  I think it's also when you put a DVD in, especially like a TV show, you're making that commitment.  Like, this is what I'm watching.  You know?  Yeah, so you're not going to be switching off of it at some point.  No, when it's on TV, it's like, oh, you know, it's on TV.  Because I've watched movies where I know I got the goddamn DVD.  I got it in ultra-fucking-beautiful widescreen, Blu-ray.  I watch Shawshank Redemption every time it's on, you know, AMC.  But I never put the DVD in just to watch it.  And there's commercials on, and you're like, why am I putting myself through this?  You know why?  Because at some point, you could just change the channel if you want to. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  You go, you know, I've seen this.  I'll change around.  Superbad was on the other day.  And I have the DVD.  But I think I wanted that collective experience.  So I was watching it as they're chopping the shit out of the movie to make it friendly for TV audiences.  Which is so stupid, because all the TV, everyone that is watching it on TV saw it in the theater.  What are you proving with that crap at this point?  I like when they would go there.  The movie was huge.  Everyone went and saw it, and now it's on TV.  What, someone has seen that movie for the first time when it's on TV? 
[01:08:30]  No fucking way.  Are stations like the WB and the CW, whatever it's called now and stuff, still doing the world broadcast premiere of, and then a movie that was in the theater two years ago.  Probably.  That you could have seen on 16 different mediums.  That's where it goes back to the point I made about an hour ago about there's no innovators.  They just continue doing the same shit that the guys did before them.  Yeah.  Enough already.  The world broadcast premiere. 
[01:09:00]  Enough already.  What does that mean?  Oh, good.  Edited, commercials, and with the sides cut off of the movie.  Wow.  I can't wait to see it.  Gee, thanks a lot.  Frank in Staten Island.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Frank.  Frank?  Yeah.  Hey.  You're not Frank from Jersey, right?  Hey, Frank.  Yeah, I'm here.  What do you got, Frank?  Hey, Anthony, if you've been watching Feinfeld and High Def Initiate on CBS, it seems like  they upgraded all the shows.  This is him.  How could they? 
[01:09:30]  But what do you mean High Def?  It's...  Well, the show was originally filmed on film, but they've been able to upgrade it to High Def,  and they've been broadcasting it on CBS.  I don't think it was filmed in an aspect ratio of High Def and widescreen.  No?  Well, it wasn't filmed on video, I guess, but it was filmed with film, so they're able  to convert that, just like they convert the old movie to a film, to High Def. 
[01:10:00]  Look, I've watched Seinfeld on DVD, and I think that's about as good as you're going  to get.  It's...  You got your standard television ratio.  It's 4-3.  You don't care about High Def that much.  They need Seinfeld reruns in High Def, right?  No, no.  Sporting events...  And you can't get it.  It's tough to see a sporting event not in High Def when you know it's in High Def.  That's it.  Or, like, when I'm watching Discovery Channel, and I just land on the regular Discovery Channel,  now I've got to find the High Def one. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  That's true, too.  Like, I will only watch High Def things like the Smithsonian Channel and things like that.  Those are great.  Planet Earth?  Earth.  Earth.  You ever see Planet Earth?  You gotta watch Earth and Life.  Planet Earth is ridiculous, but...  Did you catch any of Life yet?  Life is fucking sick.  What's Life?  It's like the sequel, a follow-up to Planet Earth.  When is that on?  Oh, dude, Sundays.  It's been on.  11 episodes, I guess they have.  What the fuck?  What channel?  Oprah narrates it.  Discovery HD Theater. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, I gotta check that out, because I got the box set for Planet Earth.  Planet Earth.  Did you get it on Blu-ray, though?  I do not.  No, I don't think I have it on Blu-ray.  Oh, then you don't have anything.  Yeah, then throw it away.  It's still in the packaging, because I saw all the Planet Earths when they were on Discovery  HD.  That's doing that show a disservice by getting it on standard DVD.  Planet Earth ruled, though.  Dude, Earth's good.  Unbelievable.  There's some shit out there, man.  This Life show is amazing, man.  What's the difference?  It's just more on the animal kingdom, on the Earth, and they are showing shit in super 
[01:11:30]  slow motion that is so clear.  It's just sick.  That's cool.  And, yeah, widescreen, high def.  Some of the shots, I don't even know how they got to those shots.  Really?  I mean, if you thought that some of the footage from Planet Earth was amazing...  Earth.  Earth.  Then, like, I mean, some of the shots that they managed to get, like, they have  a seat, and they followed, like, a, what is it, Travis, a buffalo or something? 
[01:12:00]  For, like, four weeks, where a pack of Komodo dragons, over the course of four weeks, just,  you know, attacked it a little bit here and there, to finally take down a buffalo.  And then, you know, they had their meal for, you know, the...  Four weeks they took to eat this fucking thing?  They just sat there and just stalked him, just waiting for him to die.  And what, just pecked at him every once in a while?  Oh, yeah, because I guess when a Komodo dragon bites you, like, the poison takes a while for  And if you're a buffalo...  Yeah, so they just showed, like, it was one Komodo dragon, and then the next day it was, 
[01:12:30]  like, three, because they can smell it, you know?  Oh, shit, yeah, yeah.  And then the next day it was, like, seven.  How annoying.  And they're just sitting there waiting for him to die.  That's why it's complete lunacy that they're trying to make everyone get along on this earth.  Because we're animals, we're just like that.  Yeah, we've got to fuck with shit.  We're fucking animals when it comes down to it.  Exactly.  It's never going to be like they want it to be.  No.  Might improve a little bit here and there, but...  Animals. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, you know what else I liked watching last night?  New show on The Fugitive Chronicles.  What is that?  They take a story of these guys that have escaped from prison and shit like that,  and they work out like a dramatization, a recreation, if you will.  And it's produced pretty well.  It's not bad.  And it's based on all the actual facts from these cases of escapes and stuff.  So that was kind of a cool show. 
[01:13:30]  I like that.  There was a new First 48 on.  Just a big night for criminals last night on my TV.  Oh, there's criminals on my TV every night.  I was too busy watching Sober.  Sober House.  God.  Sober House?  This Dr. Drew.  When are we going to get him on the show so we can beat the living shit out of him?  Call him out on exploiting everybody?  So, all right.  For the people that don't watch Sober House, so he has celebrity rehab, which is like, 
[01:14:00]  I think, a weekend, a long weekend.  And supposedly they go through their freaking detox, and they're not doing drugs anymore.  So then Dr. Drew needs another show, so he moves him into the Sober House.  And these people aren't ready to attempt to have a sober fucking existence, right?  Yeah.  And just putting them on television isn't the way it's supposed to be done.  So ethically, he's fucked right there.  Of course.  So then you got Tom Sizemore in the house, who's really trying to stay off the dope or 
[01:14:30]  whatever.  And his ex is in the house.  Heidi Fleiss.  How would that make sense in the real world?  Imagine, God forbid, you go into a Sober House, whatever, and your ex-wife is there.  That's how this would be.  That would be impossible.  How would that work?  Wouldn't that make you want to fucking drink and do whatever the fuck you want?  So then she goes...  Not too much.  So she goes away for the weekend, and there's major tension between Tom Sizemore and Heidi 
[01:15:00]  Fleiss in the Sober House.  Major.  They fucking hate each other.  And, you know, supposedly Tom Sizemore slapped her around, and she's still holding a grudge,  but she secretly still loves the guy, it seems like.  And every time she appears, Tom Sizemore's throwing shit.  He can't take her.  And he's trying to, like, get rid of these dumb fucking dope demons, right?  So Heidi Fleiss leaves because she has a court appearance for one of the things she did.  She comes back to the Sober House, and she tests positive for all these drugs. 
[01:15:30]  Now, Dr. Drew has this rule.  You test for drugs, you're out.  But he sits her down, and blah, blah, blah.  You can't stay here tonight.  She goes to, like, a safe...  You have to find a safe friend where you know the friends are going to make sure you don't  do any drugs.  And then he gets the group together and goes, yeah, we're going to bring Heidi back into  the house.  For what reason?  Because the controversy keeps people watching.  It makes the ratings better.  Yeah, because it makes good TV.  It's a bunch of horse shit, does Dr. Drew.  He's not helping anybody.  Who the fuck is he helping? 
[01:16:00]  Does anyone think he's helping?  A lot of people think he's helping.  God, that's so stupid.  He's on TV all the time, every time one of these celebrities fucks up, and he gives his  expert opinion.  But the exploitation he's doing with these people, I don't care because it's great TV.  But what I do care about is that no one calls him out on this, that he's really not helping  anybody, as far as these celebrities go.  Yeah.  Why would you have a Tom Sizemore and a Heidi Fleiss in the same house unless you want 
[01:16:30]  to make good TV?  You're exploiting the situation.  Right.  I mean, hell, we'll exploit anybody on this show, but at least we don't say we're doing  it to help.  No.  At least we admit that.  We're just exploiting people.  Right.  By the way, speaking of exploiting people, Jesus, at some point, I think we've got to  have Bobo on.  I was really starting to worry reading his tweets that he's going to just off himself.  Well, is he going to blow the dog or not?  I think he has.  I do have an update if you guys want to.  Oh, do you?  Great.  It's a voicemail he left me, so let me just get to it real quick. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, you read his tweets and they're so pathetic, and talking about how he'll be back on the  show, he hopes, and it's his whole life.  He's playing us.  Did you think?  I don't think he's smart enough.  I was napping the other day, and my phone rang, and I saw it was Bobo, and I was just  like, what the fuck does he want?  So I didn't pick up, but I did have a voicemail.  So when I woke up, I checked it, and this is what it said.  Oops, hang on.  It would have worked on the BlackBerry.  Oh, shit.  Wait, I keep hitting the wrong thing, so I'm on an angle. 
[01:17:30]  Here we go.  Oh, motherfucker, hang on.  Oh, damn, he's fucking it all up.  What, you didn't have a speaker on?  BlackBerrys have buttons you can push.  That's right.  Let him know.  Let him know.  He said, yes, I'll do it, but I need permission to bring the dog in.  He needs permission to bring the dog in, and he will blow a dog. 
[01:18:00]  Because the word was put out.  It's like, you know, Bobo, you want to come back on the show?  You got to blow a dog.  All right, game on, Bobo.  You're back.  You just got to blow that dog on our show.  You have permission.  Yeah.  There you go.  Find the dog.  You have permission.  You can't.  You have to do it on the show so we can supervise to make sure the dog enjoys it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bobo's in a real bad spot.  Is he?  Yeah.  He's bombing, right?  Yeah, well, because he's also been getting phone calls from our office.  Has he?  Frequently. 
[01:18:30]  Of course.  And so I guess all of a sudden I got an email on my Facebook from him this week because he  got my phone number at some point.  So the last time he was in studio, I asked to borrow his phone and deleted my phone number  out of his phone.  Very smart.  But he still has my Facebook, of course.  So he emailed me and said, Sam, you need to help me get back in the studio.  Danny and Travis are being so mean to me.  They won't let me back.  It means so much to me.  Oh, boy.  And I go, wow, that's rough. 
[01:19:00]  All of a sudden the next day, first Liam, the guest booker, comes up to me and he goes,  what's going on with Bobo?  And I go, why?  And he goes, he's been calling me.  Holy shit.  The guest booker.  And then Garrett, awesome Garrett, comes up to me and he goes, hey, dude, what's up  with Bobo?  Why do you ask?  And Garrett goes, he's been calling me.  He said you guys won't let him back on it.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  He is in a reason. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, my God.  We're going to be stuck with Bobo?  His birthday is coming up at the end of the month and the only thing he wants is to be  back here for his birthday.  I told him he can't come in for his birthday.  When's his birthday?  It's at the end of the month.  I want to come back.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Oh, Bobo.  Is this you?  Wow.  What a surprise.  This is such a surprise.  How are you, Bobo?  I'm doing fine.  Well, the reason he's listening is because he got a wake up call at 5.50 this morning. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, really?  To make sure he was up for the show.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  See, Bobo, you're officially on the show.  See?  You're back.  Congratulations.  Now, Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah?  Will you blow a dog to come back on the show?  If there's possibly a way I could bring one of the two dogs they have at home with me.  Have you been practicing?  No, but I could probably do it with no problem.  Right?  This dog, I catch this dog quite often giving himself a blowjob. 
[01:20:30]  You know why they do that?  Right.  Because they can.  Now, Bobo, we don't want you practicing at home or any of that shit.  We want this to be cold on our show.  You come in with the dog and...  What kind of dog?  Yeah.  It's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  A schnoodle, which would be a schnauzer poodle mix, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how big a cock on this dog there, Bobo? 
[01:21:00]  I'm not sure.  Maybe almost...  Maybe about the size of mine.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Poor dog.  I mean, that's small for you, but fucking huge for the dog.  Not poor for the dog.  Dogs have fucking little lipstick things that pop out.  He's got nothing.  What about your...  Pick a finger on your hand and tell me which one best represents your dog's...  Your schnoodle's dick.  Probably by a pick... 
[01:21:30]  What are my toes?  Oh, really?  That small?  Now, does he have balls or has he been neutered?  He has been neutered.  Oh, so you can't get a money shot.  No, unfortunately.  Oh, see, now we're going to need a dog that isn't neutered.  Maybe if Bobo sticks his finger in the dog's butt, he can get some...  I don't think it's going to come, though, for him. 
[01:22:00]  See, it's got to end somewhere, which is the money shot.  Right.  So you have to suck the dog's dick until he comes in your mouth.  Right.  And then you're back on the show for good.  And once again, we don't want you practicing at home.  We want this on the spot, in the studio.  Right.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  And it's got to be a bigger dog than a schnoodle.  We're thinking like Great Dane.  Do you have access to other dogs? 
[01:22:30]  No.  No, I don't.  No, huh?  I guess we're going to have to go with his...  What is this?  A schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  What's the other dog you have?  The other dog's a female.  Oh, that can't work.  That's sick.  All right.  So you're ready to do this?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll set it all up.  We'll pick a day.  We'll talk amongst ourselves, pick a day.  And in order to get back on the show, you'll come in here with the dog and suck it stick. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you call us when you've got it all figured out, Bobo, okay?  Because it seems like you've got some figuring out to do.  Yeah.  All right?  All right.  We've got to find a way for me to bring this dog into the building, though.  Oh, don't you worry about that.  We've got the freight elevator.  We're good.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  You figure it out with your mom and stuff.  Make sure she says it's okay, okay?  Yeah.  Talk it out amongst your family.  All right?  No.  I'm going to say something entirely different.  Like what?  Because I don't want to creep anybody out. 
[01:23:30]  I'm just going to say...  That you're just going to tongue its ass?  No, they're going to bring this dog.  That this dog has a face that looks like you, Anthony.  Whoa.  Jeez.  Hey, fucking dog-blowing homo cocksucker.  What is that supposed to mean?  I don't know why.  Hey, dickbag.  My sister was saying at the face of this dog.  What is that supposed to mean?  I look like a schnoodle?  No.  Keep me out of this, you dumb fuck. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, Tard.  Keep me out of this.  She's saying that.  Oh, Bobo.  You're not listening to me, you fuck fuck.  Bobo, you're back in the doghouse, my friend.  Keep me out of this.  You're not blowing a fucking dog that you think looks like me.  Don't talk about all the good pussy you get, Anthony.  Exactly.  Anthony gets a lot of fine, quality fucking pussy there, Bobo.  I don't need you fucking making up excuses that the dog looks like me.  Well, I wasn't the one who said it. 
[01:24:30]  Who was?  My sister said it.  The face of this dog.  Oh, your sister said it?  Bring her in here.  Bring her in here.  I'll take care of her.  No, it's the dog, the mustache.  Oh, fuck that sister of yours up the ass.  The dog has a mustache.  Enough with your dog.  Just blow it.  Wait, we're getting more info?  What?  What?  Oh.  Okay.  Bobo left me a voicemail, Anthony.  Really?  Yes. 
[01:25:00]  Let's see what this is all.  All right.  Let's see what this is about.  Wow.  He rocked.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, I noticed that too.  You did?  Mm-hmm.  Dude, your breath is really bad.  Oh, my God.  Really?  I'm sorry, because we haven't talked about your breath in a while.  It's turkey and iced tea.  I'll take care of it.  At least he's honest.  Wow, is that bad?  That's rough.  That was rough, you rocked.  I forgot about your breath a long time ago. 
[01:25:30]  You've been taking care of that.  Yeah, sorry.  Wow.  All right.  Bobo, I hear you.  He's left me a message.  Three saved.  I can't believe Opie what he did.  I can't believe Opie.  The traitor.  I'm going to get him.  End of message.  Whoa.  And Bobo just hung up.  Bobo hung up?  Bobo hung up, huh?  He didn't want to be on the phone when that played?  He's called everybody he has a contact for so upset that he wasn't allowed to come back 
[01:26:00]  on this show.  Yeah.  So as soon as Opie said, oh, he's suspended for a while, that was the voicemail that we  got.  A traitor.  That he was a traitor.  And then he's going to get him.  Oh, shit.  Well, he hung up, man.  So, you know.  Oh, shit.  He's going to get you.  Bobo, you're going to have to figure this out because now you got me pissed and Ant pissed.  That's it.  Blowing a dog might not be enough.  He might have to fuck him in the ass, too.  He's agreed to that in private phone calls.  Of course he has.  Or have the dog fuck him in the ass.  He's agreed to dog bukkake sessions.  Of course he has.  Dog bukkake. 
[01:26:30]  Well, it's going to be up to Bobo to figure out how to get back on the show now, man,  because I'm not helping him out.  Ant's certainly not going to help him out.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Let's take a break.  Let's start fresh with Patrice.  You don't want to, like, start right after the dog blowing segment.  Fucking Bobo talking about blowing a dog.  No.  Don't put me in the middle of your death threats.  Well, fucking Bobo shoots both of you in the top of the dome.  Make you beg for mercy.  Good for you.  Good for you.  We're going to take a quick break, and we're going to continue with Patrice O'Neal. 
[01:27:00]  Stay there.  Goddamn, Patrice's giving us a show already.  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Yeah, we haven't even talked about the Survivor guy yet.  Holy shit.  He killed his wife on vacation in Cancun, and he thought he was going to get away with it.  What a fucking hack.  He doesn't watch Forensic Files.  He's obviously in a miserable marriage, so he goes, you know what?  Let's go on vacation.  So they go out sightseeing for the day, but his intention was to kill her. 
[01:27:30]  Then he throws her in a sewer, goes back to the fucking hotel, all scratched up, and goes,  ah, my wife's missing.  Yeah.  And he expects everyone to believe this.  Yeah, what the fuck?  He doesn't watch Forensic Files.  He doesn't know.  Well, because he's used to all the dick sucking when he's on Survivor set, where his assistant,  he just goes, listen, such and such, do this, do that.  All right.  They do it.  Everybody, hey.  Great idea.  Good.  I said I want grapes, and everybody just, so he figured he'd just kill his wife, and  then somebody would just go.  You're smart.  What was he, a producer or something for Survivor? 
[01:28:00]  He said producer for Survivor.  Yeah, so, and he left Survivor in 2004.  Oh, so he wasn't really, that was his claim.  By the way, we just got back on the radio, and the morning mashup is coming in, because  they were yelling and screaming at each other, this, they were yelling at poor Nicole.  Where's Nicole?  She ain't coming in?  No, I think she's walking down.  No, we're just fighting, because Stan's fucking blind to this Tiger Woods shit.  Is she taking her time?  Is she taking her time?  I think she went to the bathroom.  Sorry, dude.  We're a big fucking radio show.  What's up, boy?  I love the radio show.  What's up, what's happening here?  We heard some screaming out in the hallway. 
[01:28:30]  We're fighting over Tiger Woods.  Huh?  We're fighting about the Tiger Woods commercial.  Make your point.  Make your point.  No, Stanley T doesn't understand.  Now, I understand Tiger was close with his dad.  Yeah.  Stan's like, I don't see the death card he's pulling here.  I'm like, he's pulling the, his fucking dad died.  Playing the death card.  And if Tiger Woods, in a black and white screen, pouting like a little fucking puppy dog,  and he's like, his dad's, his dead dad's voice, no one's going to critique that.  Stan doesn't get the death card.  He's like, no, he just loves his dad.  Spoken like a true prick.  That's why we call him Dick. 
[01:29:00]  Get the fuck out of here, man.  He had a great, close relationship with his father.  I followed his whole career, okay?  Right.  It's a way, it's brilliant marketing.  It's a way to confront an issue.  Damn, I let my wife down.  I let my dad down.  This is what he would have said to me if I was here, if he was alive.  Maybe I wouldn't, I had guidance.  I wouldn't have been in this jackpot in the first place.  It's not a fucking death card.  It ain't because he's black either.  I'm just, no, no.  It has nothing to do with color.  It has nothing to do with color.  Now I'm talking about agreeing with him.  Hold on, hold on.  Let the record state, as Rich was talking, Patrice is shaking his head like, no, I don't agree with that at all. 
[01:29:30]  Then the black guy makes your point.  It's arrogant.  So now people are going to think you're...  You know what it is?  Yeah, right.  But I'm just saying, the idea, I was listening to sports radio yesterday.  White guys are just, they're arrogant of what's supposed to happen and not happen and how dare you-ness.  Yeah.  Really clouds their fucking minds.  The thing is, we know that he took advantage of his dead father, but the idea is that he's looking himself, and what would his dad say? 
[01:30:00]  Now, instead of him going, here's what my dad say, they had clips of his dead dad saying shit that could reflect, even though his dad got side pussy.  It was just Tiger.  Yeah, let's not forget.  It's white guy shit.  Tiger's father did get side pussy.  He was a notorious side pussy guy.  Now, on top of all of that, out of all the coffers, I bet you guaranteed every one of them cheated on their wife.  Like, Tiger got fucking caught.  Okay?  Tiger's numbers might have been huger, but they all got messages. 
[01:30:30]  Well, it was also that image he was trying to portray.  Yeah, the wholesomeness and the family guy.  You're up a little higher, you're going to fall a little further.  They're all cheating.  It's amazing that, you know, he does one dead dad commercial, and everyone's like, well, I guess it's okay now.  And it's to sell sneakers.  It's not genuine.  He's trying to sell sneakers.  Who are you?  Who are you?  That guy again.  I like that Stanley T finally showing some passion.  Holy shit.  Yeah, man.  I don't think he's trying to sell sneakers. 
[01:31:00]  Wait a minute.  Is it golf balls and golf clubs?  What's the sneakers thing about?  I don't think he's trying to sell it.  His existence is to sell things.  Right.  But for that commercial, it was a well-devised, you know, people go at some poor taste, maybe.  But at the end of the day, it was him with a reflection.  That's what he was trying to do.  It's not like, it wasn't, he didn't even have a Nike logo on the fucking commercial.  It's just like, they could have even been douchebags and went like, but Nike just had, they could 
[01:31:30]  have had his dead dad going, and don't forget to wear your comfortable nights.  I'm sure they had that shit.  Now, Nicole, you were yelling and screaming.  I know you guys got to go back on your show, but why were you yelling in the hall?  That's the only reason why we brought you guys in here.  They get so crazy and so fired up.  They fight like they're children, like they have some personal connection to Tiger.  Don't start sounding like a hole.  Huh?  Don't start sounding like a hole.  Yeah.  That they're fighting like children.  Yeah, we like it.  Don't be a hole.  They're fighting like guys that, you know, have passionate discussions about things. 
[01:32:00]  They were acting like they know Tiger or something.  Like, they were acting like, you know, they were personally, like, offended by this whole  thing.  And on-air fights are kind of like the Tiger Woods commercial.  It really is taking advantage of something.  These guys are going to have breakfast at the end of the show.  That's very true.  It's just, it makes life interesting.  We got to go.  All right, Stanley T.  Making a good point today on our show.  Stanley T.  And Patrice agrees.  I just, I just don't.  You do forget that Tiger's fucking father got the side pus. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  He was a notorious side pussy guy.  Part of his genes to do that.  It's just like, it's just, he's trying to, and quite frankly, it's really, look, at the  end of the day, watching this Tiger thing unfold, he was smarter than everybody else.  First of all, he's just a golf prodigy.  He has to take off six, seven months to come down to the same level as these bums he's playing  with, sharp Tiger playing every day. 
[01:33:00]  It's just no, so he, this cheating thing, and he comes back, and he's kind of a little  bit off, and a little bit going through this shit.  He needs all this shit to make golf interesting again for him.  Best first round ever at Augusta for Tiger Woods, so he's not even a little off.  Kicking ass.  He's actually kicking ass.  So he's better.  Because now he's mind.  He's technically better, because that was the best opening round he's had at Augusta.  So now, evidently, his golf game is better, because he now can, he's into golf again. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, he doesn't have to think, imagine all the worry in his head, like, oh my god, this  chick, if my wife finds out about that, oh my god, that Perkins waitress, and he's trying  to fucking golf.  Now if everything's out, he's like, I'm a free man.  You know what this is?  Whack.  It was, I don't, it was when Michael Jordan, I know Michael Jordan's father died, because  it is, but when he took off to play baseball, that, that, that debacle, and when he came  back to basketball, they just destroyed everybody in basketball.  That's this, it's just, he took a, he took his time off. 
[01:34:00]  You think he's gonna be even better now?  He's gonna be brutal!  I loved Michael Jordan playing baseball with that eight foot fucking strike zone he had.  What was he thinking?  It was like watching daddy long legs out there fucking, what the fuck was he thinking?  Was it awful?  That was just awful.  Funny, man.  It was horrendous.  His long basketball legs.  Yes.  The pitchers were like, this is a joke, right?  Look at his strike zone.  It's like hitting the side of a fucking house for strikes. 
[01:34:30]  Oh my god.  He just looked with daddy long legs.  It's even funnier, Ant.  He looked like a big fucking spider up there.  He was.  He was.  He was just giant legs.  I don't know how they even got fucking uniforms for him.  He tried to bend down a little bit to, you know, crush the strike zone down a bit, but that was a lanky motherfucker out there.  We're like, man, he must be hurting.  What is he doing?  What the fuck is he doing?  I know he's bored, but.  Yeah.  He's focused.  It just gave him something to do now.  It gave him something to do.  And it freed his mind from all that worry that he was going to get caught. 
[01:35:00]  He was probably worrying all the time.  What bitch is going to show up at this fucking match and fuck me over?  And now it's just like everything was out, open, in the clear.  What if it's tougher than you think?  Maybe you can't hit this kind of pitchy.  Is that going to disturb you?  No, I think what it does is it really gives credibility to the game of baseball as a whole.  You know, a lot of people view me as a decent athlete, and yet I'm trying to come out here and show that, you know,  I found out that these athletes out here, these professionals are athletes, 
[01:35:30]  and yet it takes a really good talent, accepting a talented player.  Baseball stinks.  No, I really don't have a good time to see the fun, and hopefully I can, you know, get better at it.  If I don't succeed, at least I learn a lot about the game, and I can watch it with a little bit better interest.  You know, Michael, already from reading about what you've done in baseball,  I've instructed that hitting the baseball is your biggest problem.  But let me tell you something.  You're no different than anybody else. 
[01:36:00]  They all have told me the toughest thing to do in baseball is to hit a good fastball.  It's tough, I mean, because you're back there, you're trying to guess with the pitcher, basically.  God bless Will Ferrell, by the way, who does a perfect him.  You are a hot dog.  Hey, hey, Michael Chork.  Jay Moore did a great Harry Carey pick, too.  Are you a baseball fan?  Not really.  You?  Not as much as I used to be.  Can I ask you a quick baseball question, please?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Why not 80 games?  I know.  They really do play a lot of fucking games.  We've been saying that.  The three major sports have got to cut their seasons in half.  And let me tell you something.  See, in Olympic hockey, like, when every fucking possession means something, that'll bring  the excitement to a whole new level.  If you ask me, fucking basketball lasts, is that just played year-round?  Is that fucking playing all fucking, is there even a season?  Do they play the championship and then they fucking just start playing the next day?  Football, 16 games. 
[01:37:00]  You understand why.  Football's easy.  So that means every possession means something.  You only have 16 fucking games.  Hockey's 84 games.  Hockey's too much, too, and that's my sport.  Is it 84?  It's 82-ish.  It's 82?  Basketball, 82, I think.  Why is baseball 162?  Two seasons.  Right.  It really is amazing.  Why is it so long?  Do we really need more baseball?  Because my theory about having shorter games is this.  I want to see, if I'm paying a ticket, I want to see CeCe Sabathia.  Okay?  Right, right.  With 80 games, instead of going, oh, jeez, I got a ticket, but fucking Jerry Maguire's 
[01:37:30]  fucking pitching, I get to see CeCe Sabathia next week.  Yeah.  Like, if he's pitching today, I buy a ticket, he's pitching again next week.  They only need, now they need about three pitchers that are all stars, as opposed to  18 who suck.  So you got to rest them.  Who suck.  But you got to rest the pitchers, so.  Yeah, but you rest them weekly.  Right.  Like, they pitch every, what, five days?  Yeah, that's about right.  So now every home game, you can see CeCe Sabathia if you want to. 
[01:38:00]  But why 162?  It's probably because.  Because there was nothing else to do when they came up with baseball.  Yeah.  We didn't have smartphones.  It is a lot more about the entertainment for the fans than it is about the game, like  football is, or some of these other sports, I think.  I think, like, a day going to the ballpark and watching a game isn't just sitting there  watching the game intently like you would a football game. 
[01:38:30]  Football game.  Every fucking play, you are just fixated on every fucking play when you go to the game.  It's less intense.  It's more of a outing.  You can get up and take a piss during the middle of the game.  You don't give a shit.  Sometimes you miss something.  In football, you lose the first four games of the season.  Your season is basically over already.  It's over.  Yeah, yeah.  You can lose the first four games of the baseball season.  It doesn't even matter.  It doesn't matter.  The first 40.  Right.  It doesn't matter.  20 more games.  All-star break, and then you fucking kick ass, you can win the World Series. 
[01:39:00]  0-40, you're still not 500.  Like, you're still not even in a bad percentage.  You got to turn around a little bit, but you still have a shot.  Oh, my God.  After watching Olympic hockey, I'm thinking, God, these sports have got to just cut their  seasons in half.  Make every game more important.  Like, if they did, then what are we doing in August?  I mean, I'm sad in August anyway, because I'm not a baseball fan.  You know what?  You could spread the season out still. 
[01:39:30]  The other thing with baseball, they play four times in one week.  Five times in one week.  Well, that's just it.  It's another game.  Baseball is a game you can play twice in one day.  Right.  They're like, hey, let's play two games.  Imagine having a double-  A football, a double-header in football.  Can you imagine?  They'd be bleeding, coughing up blood.  I argue with a friend of mine at baseball, you don't even have to actually like your team.  Like, you can just be an asshole and play baseball.  Just do your job.  Like, I catch this thing at shortstop and throw it to first. 
[01:40:00]  After, I'm just, I don't need, there's no teamwork you need.  Like, I argue with people who love baseball.  I'm like, you just don't need what you need out of football.  Like, if I don't do my job in football, someone gets fucked up.  But if I don't, my job is all I have to worry about in baseball, but it's such a, it's such  a boring, I got a friend that wants to turn me on to how good baseball is, and I say, dude,  even the highlights stink.  That's bad. 
[01:40:30]  They don't have, I've seen hockey highlights that, to this day, one of the greatest highlights  I've ever seen in hockey was that Michigan kid picking the puck up from behind and carrying  it, and to this day, I'm going, why don't people do that more?  That spinny move and flipping it in the goal.  You can see some amazing shit, but.  There's a few of those type plays now online.  Here's how big football is.  It's only 16 weeks and one game a week, and you watch the combine.  Like, you watch, they have the combine gets great ratings, where you just watch these college 
[01:41:00]  kids run to be able to play football, to see where they're going to get drafted in football.  That's how great football is.  It's just amazing, man.  Here's the best hockey goals.  Oh, well.  Yeah, this isn't going to help anybody out, but.  All right, whatever.  You can check it out for yourself.  Hockey has great highlights.  Great highlights, man.  You know what it is, though?  It's a fast-moving game.  It's one of those, baseball, you know, you can't go there and expect this fast-moving fucking  game.  It just doesn't happen. 
[01:41:30]  But, you know, when.  Do you enjoy, what's the enjoyment of it?  That's all I'm, okay, let me stop trashing it.  But what is it that makes it watchable?  I don't know.  It's just like anything else.  It's subjective.  I just enjoy, like, watching.  It's something also that I'm not.  I don't have to sit there and fixate on the game.  I could be on my laptop and hear, like, oh, and look up and go, okay, what's happening?  But now that's going on.  Now that baseball is a week into the season, do you feel like your team's in trouble or  anything?  No, come on. 
[01:42:00]  We fucking took two out of three from the Sox.  And I love how the announcers make it sound like it's important, like, oh, God, they  really needed to win that one.  Well, they're rivals, you know.  Yeah, why?  Yeah, because last year, they beat again in game 97.  Last year, the Sox fucking beat the Yankees eight games in a row.  Eight in a row, and they still won the World Series.  And they still kick the shit out of the season.  Who cares?  So who cares, right?  They dominated the Yankees until win.  No one cares.  I love how they try to make game 37 really important to the future of the season. 
[01:42:30]  If we fought eight times, and I won eight times, the ninth time you go, you know what,  let me try this.  That's his weakness.  Now I'm losing eight times in a row.  Oh, he really, he can't see too good out of his left eye.  I didn't notice that until after the 12th fight.  Yeah, let me start tapping that side.  But I think to answer your question, there was no TV.  There were no phones, obviously.  So, you know, baseball was all...  Baseball's an old fucking sport. 
[01:43:00]  You had it on the radio, and that was your entertainment.  You didn't have it on...  Is it the oldest?  I think out of the big four.  I would probably have to say yes, right?  I'm sure people were playing hockey in Canada, you know, on some lake somewhere, but...  Which is just cold soccer.  But fucking baseball's been around since like the 1800s and shit.  Like with people watching it, with those big straw hats, in fast motion.  Taking their hats off, all going to the ballpark with their ties. 
[01:43:30]  But they loved baseball back then, man.  Oh, yeah.  They love it now, but...  Yeah, back then it was just...  That's all they had.  It is a traditional, very traditional sport.  Like, I mean, I understand the people that love it.  I just...  They had that in the middle of the announcers the other night were talking about the fact  that there are some bad calls, and they want to bring replays in, and they said there  will be a fucking replay call by the captain there, by the fucking coach, whatever the  fuck, every night for an out at first. 
[01:44:00]  Like, every fucking night there would be stopping the game and checking to see if the ball got  in the guy's glove first, or if the guy hit the bag first.  Right.  And then they started saying, if you want to go that far, then just set up a fucking  radar zone, some fucking gadget for the strike zone, then take the umps out of the mix,  and you could take the human element out of baseball, but then it's such tradition that, 
[01:44:30]  you know, people would just never...  They would never do that.  And I'm never going to get it, because, you know, I watch anything that does a countdown.  I like any, anything, top ten bugs, I just watch it.  You need to know what the number one bug is.  I just need to know who the baddest bug is.  And they got the number one baseball catch of all time, kind of arguably, is Willie Mays'  Oh, the basket catch?  Over his back.  I watch that and go, really? 
[01:45:00]  I watch that and go, ew, ew.  That's the best?  Ah, there's way better catches than that.  But they have that as the best catch ever.  When someone's jumping up and their fucking glove is behind the wall, taking away someone's  home run, to me, that's like, wow, that is fucking pretty cool.  But that happens three times a year.  Exactly.  I know.  Exactly.  They're few and far between.  A nice diving catch.  You gotta watch 120,000 innings hoping to see that. 
[01:45:30]  But that's just purists.  Because, you know, you watch purists.  Like, Bert Sugar is a boxing purist.  And he'll do the top 20 knockouts.  And it'll be like Cliff Boganovich.  Like, for real, Bert?  Did you just say Jack Johnson knocks out a dinosaur was the greatest?  What an asshole.  All right, we got some info on the hockey thing.  Steve in Pennsylvania.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, guys. 
[01:46:00]  Good morning, Steve.  Hockey actually originated in Canada in 11-23.  Two Canucks decided to pop a beaver skull around on the ice with a pine bough.  Yeah, in 11-20, a beaver skull.  What that was was a scene from King Arthur.  There was a guy with a curve stick who beat another guy's head in during a Viking conflict.  Jesus. 
[01:46:30]  Tom in Cincinnati.  Tom.  Hey, good evening, boys.  Hey, Tom.  Good morning, boys.  Hey.  Yeah, I think you can pretty well sum up baseball.  You got about five minutes of excitement crammed into about two hours.  Wait, didn't they figure that out, how long the baseball is actually in play?  The ball is actually in play, yeah.  I think they figured that out, and it was no time at all.  Yeah, but you can say the same thing about football.  Football's only, they said like 11 minutes of actual thing doing something. 
[01:47:00]  Wow.  Really?  Out of 11 minutes.  But it's really like someone hitting you hard with a boulder for 30 seconds.  Right, right.  Let's be honest, man.  I've talked about it before.  I think basketball's one of the most boring fucking sports there is.  I can't, because the scoring is the big thing in anything.  It's, when it's like, oh, shit, the score, like hockey.  Well, that's why they say, oh, oh, my God.  But that's why they say soccer's so good, because, you know, they don't score.  Well, there's a fine balance. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  But basketball, it's like, oh, what was the score?  A hundred and fucking five?  And it's like, they're just scoring constantly.  It really, there's a way to take out, to take someone's, like, look, Gavin, my buddy likes soccer, man.  Gavin does?  He's a soccer guy.  Of course, he's a hooligan.  So I was playing him in, like, soccer 2009 or some shit.  Oh, God.  And I was beating him, like, 9-0.  9-0.  He starts beating me, because you know what he starts doing?  He starts really playing soccer. 
[01:48:00]  So he starts to kick the ball over to where they kick it, and then he passes it where they pass.  So he starts playing like you really play soccer.  And I go, this is why soccer stinks.  Soccer fucking sucks.  And I got another buddy who loves soccer.  I said, listen, I don't want to watch any sport, right, where the best player is every week there's a new best player in the world.  I said, I just got used to Ronaldinho, right? 
[01:48:30]  Now some douchebag from Argentina is the best in the world.  He's the guy.  Jordan was the best guy for 10 years.  Yeah, yeah.  Before people argued that someone else was the best.  On anything.  It's like this guy in Argentina, last week, Ronaldo or somebody was the guy.  This week, it's another fucking guy.  There's always a new guy.  And no one cares.  I twitted one time, soccer sucks.  I've never got so many threatening twits.  They're like, you fat fucking fool. 
[01:49:00]  Like, soccer stinks.  Well, it fails here miserably any time they try to bring it to the U.S.  No one wants to watch it.  Big reason why, watching this, listen to the sports thing.  One, greatest point ever made about soccer.  Our best athletes go to the big four.  Yeah.  Which, hockey being probably the fourth one.  I would have to agree.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, you're a great athlete.  We got plays for Patrice. 
[01:49:30]  Yes, Danny.  Go ahead.  Make your point.  I'm sorry, Patrice.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I was going to say that the fourth, but soccer, if LeBron James plays soccer, we might like  soccer.  Like, if our best athletes play soccer, I'd watch it.  But our 15th best athletes play against their first best athletes.  Yeah, because they love it.  The world loves soccer.  We fucking hate it.  So we get nobodies that play soccer.  So no stars are playing soccer.  That's why the world hates us.  The rest of the world is playing soccer, and we're like, ah, whatever. 
[01:50:00]  Stinky sport.  We don't want to acknowledge our dumb sport.  We want to play the great sport football that no one else plays and call ourselves the  world champs.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No one else plays it.  The world champions.  I used to laugh at that girl.  Of the United States.  I'm like, but what about the team in, I don't know, Russia?  What football?  But, like, we are...  We're pompous.  Are there any other fucking football teams, like, in...  They try to make Europe.  This is what they try to do.  They try to make a European football league.  But that went nowhere.  I know we got to ship teams over there every so often just to play games. 
[01:50:30]  And we start promoting it now.  It sells out Wembley Stadium.  But that's like this 70 million people in England, and they sell out 50,000 in Wembley.  But it takes up to the time of the game to sell it out.  Even though it's a great...  You know, football is a good sport.  But Canada plays, but no one gives a shit about Canadian football.  No.  Let's be honest.  It is a weird fucking sport, man.  It's just...  Living in Buffalo, you got to peek at the CFL.  It is strange.  Why not just play regular fucking football? 
[01:51:00]  Are they just so fucking fixated on soccer?  Listen, the world...  When I used to travel around, it's...  I used to wonder what it was.  It just...  They love...  I used to sell popcorn and peanuts and shit at the Boston Garden.  I used to run around and do that shit.  You really did that.  I swear to God.  Popcorn here.  Peanut here.  I know you've mentioned it over the years, but you really did.  Ice cream here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pizza here.  So...  Got the pizza here.  So...  I used to go, what this game makes me sick? 
[01:51:30]  But if you know what hockey is and know why they will have a face-off at some point, why  there's a missing goalie, why there's a penalty shot, when you fucking know the rules, hockey's  interesting.  When you know the rules of soccer, it's probably where you go, oh, he fucked up.  The guy should have ran around instead of straight, even without the ball.  So you go, oh, the excitement of almost him getting... 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That's why you get the argument of basketball and soccer, the point scoring.  What if you didn't score points in basketball?  It'd be like, am I really watching these guys try to figure out how to fucking score?  But isn't soccer the one sport where they could just do commercial breaks while the game's  still going on?  And it doesn't stop!  Right.  They come back.  They know most likely you're not going to miss anything.  It's 90 minutes of non-stop action!  So they're like, yeah, we're going to take a five-minute commercial break, and we know 
[01:52:30]  that you know you're not going to miss anything.  Of these fucking dishwashers and cooks running around for 90 minutes!  Have you heard this soccer clip?  No, no, no.  Oh, we played it two days ago.  Yeah, I love this guy.  What's the setup, Dan, for Patrice?  Basically, this sideline reporter is reporting on a soccer game, and when they throw it at him,  he has no idea what's going on.  He's the sideline reporter, like, yeah, Danny said.  So, you know, they're going to him.  Listen to this. 
[01:53:00]  Don't ask themselves who scored against Plymouth.  They're on the brink of the playoffs at the moment, and James Coppinger has got that  goal.  And we're up to Fratton Park, where there's been a red card.  But for who, Chris Kamara?  I don't know, Jeff, has it?  I must have missed that.  It's a red card.  Chris, have you not been watching?  I don't know.  I don't know where that's come from, Chris.  I have no idea what has happened there.  What's happened, Chris? 
[01:53:30]  I don't know, Jeff.  He wasn't even watching.  God bless him.  God bless him for laughing.  Chris, let me tell you, according to our sources, Anthony Van Den Boer has been sent off for  a second bookable offence.  Get your fingers out and count up the number of Portsmouth players who are on the field.  No, you're right.  I saw him go off, and I thought they were bringing a sub on, Jeff.  I thought they were bringing a sub on. 
[01:54:00]  That's professionalism, I can't.  Still nil nil.  That's what he ended up saying.  It's still 0-0.  Who cares?  Oh, how great is that?  Oh, man.  I saw him coming off.  And they were having a good time, at least.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, not all serious.  They were having a good time.  He's a sideline, and he wasn't even watching.  Sometimes laughing will get you out of that.  You see Shepard, what's his name?  Shepard Smith. 
[01:54:30]  When the guy got through on the call?  Oh, yeah.  He's got a couple of instances where Shepard Smith will laugh at something he said.  No, when the guy got through and said, Jamie Foxx is a cunt.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you see that shit?  Yeah, we got it right here.  Oh, my God.  And Shepard Smith was just, oh, my God.  Yeah, one of Howard's guys got through and was able to do this on Shepard.  It was Shepard Smith's show?  That's Foxx, oh, yeah.  Yeah.  New information out of the mine explosion in West Virginia.  It's just come to us from Richard Kandrowski, who is a spokesperson for the energy company 
[01:55:00]  and has new numbers from that mine facility.  Richard, thank you.  What have you learned?  We've learned that Jamie Foxx is a cunt.  Oh, my goodness.  Well, that's unfortunate.  Wow.  It's never happened to us here, but it's always distressing when there are six people killed  in a mine disaster.  And we're waiting for 21 others to find out whether they are alive or dead.  And something like that sneaks by our screeners. 
[01:55:30]  Disgusting.  Stop being dramatic.  Stop being dramatic, because the only reason you're fucking broadcasting this whole thing  is hoping that everyone's dead.  That's what I'm saying.  So you can fucking sensationalize the whole thing.  You're sensationalizing the whole thing.  What are you actually doing by reporting this?  Oh, God, that is too much.  And he's all serious.  And they've got to bring up, you know, it's terrible that during such a tragedy.  It's like, well, that's the only time you get a lot of callers and people watching.  Pussy should have just said, ah, you got me.  We're going to go, let's move on.  Ah, shit.  Ah, shit, fuck.  I guess Jamie Foxx is a cunt. 
[01:56:00]  What are you going to say?  We have to go back to the greatest catch of all time, because Jason has a good point  on that.  Jason in Texas, go ahead.  Hey, boys.  I just want to make the point that most of these spectacular baseball plays are done by  weekend softball players that have had a six-pack, you know, put back.  So, I mean, it happens all the time.  Come on.  Come on.  Baseball.  He's saying that, you know, any miraculous catch you could see.  On a weekend at a softball game when the guys are drinking and stuff. 
[01:56:30]  He's pretty accurate.  Nah.  He's pretty accurate.  He's softball, man.  He's pretty accurate.  I still, to this day, was trying to figure out how to just please tell me how to watch  baseball.  Yeah.  Because there's nothing going on from now till late August when I can watch spring practice  games in college on ESPNU where they'll actually air Florida's inter-team scrimmage.  But until then, I've got to watch baseball.  I'll tell you this much about baseball, though.  When the playoffs hit, holy shit, it's way more exciting. 
[01:57:00]  Everything, though.  It kicks in.  I guess.  But baseball especially, man.  You feel every pitch.  You really do.  Each hit is important.  Each thing is important.  Right.  And that's why, going right back to your point, if you just cut down the season, you would  bring some more of that excitement into the everyday game.  So you're watching, especially when you get a team that's building or there's some new  players on there.  If you watch from the beginning, you kind of see if they're getting better, what the 
[01:57:30]  fucking...  Totally disagree.  What the manager's going to do.  Because those players could be on another team next year.  I mean, when we were growing up...  I mean, year to year.  I'm not talking about...  I'm just talking New Year.  When we grew up, that was important.  You had your players, and they rarely got traded.  So you really were invested in them as...  No, I mean, early in the season, like with the Yankees, all right, we were watching  Granderson.  Granderson, right.  Watching Granderson out there.  New player with the Yankees.  He's been around, but, you know, with the Yankees there this season.  Kind of interesting.  Hits a couple of home runs in the first couple of games. 
[01:58:00]  So now you watch and see what he does.  You know?  See if he fucking...  If he falls apart, if he's good, if Jabba Chamberlain can fucking do more than fucking  three pitches.  That's in hell.  Patrice gave you a little...  I know.  Well, here's one of the innovations.  You can innovate things.  One of the things that baseball did, I don't know when they did it, but was they put the  wild card, I guess.  There's a wild card.  Yeah, yeah.  The game.  So they allowed a few extra teams in. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  Before that, if you didn't win your fucking division, you didn't play in the playoff.  You didn't play.  So the pennant was important, but that meant it took you 100.  You had to fuck...  You knew you sucked at 70 games.  You have another 90 games to play for no reason?  You could suck for six months.  Are you serious?  Like, their playoff system is just not...  It's just... 
[01:59:00]  I just want to know how to watch it.  That's all.  I mean, and I'm being dead serious because there's nothing else to watch but baseball.  I just want to know how to watch baseball and think it's good.  You just can't expect too much out of it, I guess.  I just like having it on, you know.  Like I said, as the season goes on, I'll get a lot more interested in everything that's  going on.  But the beginning of the season, you're right.  There's so many games, it doesn't matter.  But even during a game, just during a game, like even the playoffs, what you're worried 
[01:59:30]  about is, oh, okay, this pitch, this pitch.  But if you're into baseball, maybe you're into guessing the next pitch.  Maybe you're into...  Oh, right, right, right.  Here's how wacky baseball is.  You probably talked about this already, but I guess Xbox 360, if you throw a perfect game  in their game, you win a million dollars.  Is that confident?  Yeah, if you throw a fake perfect game, you win a million fucking dollars on Xbox, man. 
[02:00:00]  Is that true, Danny?  They're that confident?  It's for the 2K Sports baseball game.  Has anyone come close?  It's MLB 2K10.  You know what?  I don't know.  I don't know if anybody's...  It has to be the hardest level, too, I think.  I'll start.  You've got to be playing it on, obviously.  They're still showing commercials for it, so I don't think anybody's done it yet.  But has anyone come close?  I mean, the gaming sites have to be abuzz with someone going, oh, fuck, it was a one-hitter.  Goddamn, it came close.  I don't know how pissed you are.  But that's a marketing tool. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, of course it is, but I'm just saying how fucking hard it is.  Well, because in my opinion and in a lot of people's opinion, that game sucks and nobody  really buys it.  The one for PlayStation is much better.  So they had to do something to make more people buy the game.  PlayStation rules.  Yeah, but still, I tell you what, if your game is not selling...  50 people who have them.  If your game isn't selling, to risk a million dollars for anybody doing something that the 
[02:01:00]  game can do, that's taking a chance even to sell it.  I'd rather not do it and save money.  I disagree.  Because they're doing that, they probably sold a million dollars worth of more...  A million dollars more.  Yeah, it's a way to make a lot of people buy a shitty game.  Right, so...  I gotta say one more thing about Granderson.  When he gets a pop fly to center field, it is frightening.  You're gonna see some fucking errors out of this guy. 
[02:01:30]  Because he's constantly adjusting and looking like, should I be back a little further?  That's great.  That's something that's been scaring the shit out of me with this guy.  That's great.  He's gonna drop some fucking balls out there.  He took Damon's place, right?  Mm-hmm.  He took Damon's place.  That's great.  Is he better than Damon?  So far, so good.  It's only three games.  He's had a good start.  Yeah, yeah.  He's younger.  He's got better range.  His eyes are all fucked up, you think?  Dude, there's something going on when...  I love that.  But then there's a high fly to center field, and he's kind of like, eh, she's going back 
[02:02:00]  with my side.  One of my favorite players...  And by the way, the flags were still at Fenway.  Oh, really?  There was no...  The flags were hanging.  No wind?  Yeah, yeah.  One of my favorite players growing up was Dave Kingman.  Yeah.  Played for the Mets.  And he either would hit a 580-foot home run or strike out horribly.  That was all you got from Kingman.  I love players like that.  But he had...  I think he has the all-time strikeout fucking record or something. 
[02:02:30]  In a season or something like that.  Well, they always have that stat when you talk about Babe Ruth, you know?  Dude, he wouldn't miss the ball by feet.  Not inches.  Feet.  He would fall down.  He would be swinging so hard.  Swinging it fucking...  Can you give me a Dave Kingman...  Into the dirt?  ...highlight?  I don't even know.  I mean, this is going way the fuck back.  I just don't even like their culture.  I don't even like...  I don't even like that Pete Rose is not in the Hall of Fame.  Like, I don't like them.  They do have a holier-than-thou attitude. 
[02:03:00]  Enough with your stupid morality.  Yeah, just...  I don't like that.  Pete Rose entertained a lot of fucking people and was pretty damn impressive.  Put him in there.  If he threw games, he's still one of the best players.  Yeah.  Like, he has like 7,000 hits or some shit.  And it's like, even if he was gambling, he was playing hard.  He was so good at gambling, they're not even really sure if he gambled.  Yeah, exactly.  They had a real tough time trying to figure it out.  Enough of baseball.  It's just enough of it.  Is he fucking blowing games or is he just playing poker?  Play the Lasorda tirade when Kingman blasted a homer. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, do we have that?  Denver Pest?  Yeah.  Kingman was just...  Look it up for yourself if you care.  This guy was just an animal.  Yeah.  He's fourth all-time in strikeouts.  Right.  Oh, really?  Fourth all-time in strikeouts.  But I think he has the record for a single season or something.  Do we have the Tommy Lasorda thing?  That's another thing in baseball.  You can suck and you're a Hall of Famer. 
[02:04:00]  This is how sucky baseball is.  If you're a lifetime 300, you're a great fucking hitter.  Right.  That means you miss seven.  There's no other sport where you can miss seven out of ten and not suck.  And you're great.  Imagine the NBA.  You're missing seven.  You're a 30% free throw shooter?  Imagine you're missing seven out of ten free throws.  How about field goals?  You're missing seven out of ten and they're like, holy shit, we got a Hall of Famer on this team. 
[02:04:30]  What do you think?  That's what baseball...  And then people go, no, that just says how hard it is.  That says how much it sucks.  No, well, okay, field goals.  Then how about somebody throws the fucking ball 90 miles an hour at the guy's foot and  he's then got to kick it through the fucking post.  You know what?  If he missed that, if that's what we're supposed to do in football and you missed it seven out  of ten times, you'd suck.  You'd fucking suck.  You'd fucking suck.  That's fucking funny, man. 
[02:05:00]  I love it.  Fucking love it.  Yeah, seven out of ten, you blow.  And you're great.  When you said nothing, you could be 30%.  You're great.  We should take a break.  Hey, you got the Carlin fucking football thing?  Carlin had a great take on sports.  Oh, the baseball football back and forth thing?  Can you find that really fast?  I don't know how long the bid is.  It's a Saturday Night Live.  Fucking brilliant.  Yeah, it's one of the greatest.  And your old friend Chris Rock.  God damn, I love this Chris Rock. 
[02:05:30]  I wish he would do our show more.  He just beat the shit out of Letterman right in front of his face.  Did he?  This thing is everywhere.  Brings up Letterman's wife.  You know how everyone's been kind of like tiptoeing around the fact that Letterman had  affairs with interns or whatever?  That whole thing?  Chris Rock went right at him.  Was it Deuce Chills?  It's great.  And everyone is talking about it.  It's two and a half minutes.  We can do it after the break.  Carlin bits what?  Five minutes?  Five minutes.  Yeah, I think I might have that sort of Dave King.  Oh, let's listen to that first. 
[02:06:00]  Hopefully this is it.  Hopefully.  Real audio.  Just a few basic comments about your feelings on the game.  Well, naturally, I feel bad about losing a ballgame like that.  There's no way you should lose that ballgame.  But it just doesn't make sense.  What's your opinion of King's performance?  What's my opinion of King's performance?  What the f*** do you think is my opinion of it?  I think it was f***ing f***ing.  Put that in.  I don't f***ing f***ing. 
[02:06:30]  Opinion of his performance?  F***ing f***ing.  He beat us with three f***ing home runs.  What the f***ing do you mean?  What is my opinion of his performance?  Why don't you ask me a question like that?  What is my opinion of his performance?  Fucking Lasorda was good.  Of his performance.  F***ing.  He hit three home runs.  She f***ed.  I'm f***ing f***ed off to lose a f***ing game.  And you ask me my opinion of his performance.  F***ing.  I mean, that's a tough question to ask me, isn't it? 
[02:07:00]  What is my opinion of his performance?  Relax, Tommy.  Yes, it is.  Ask it and you gave me an answer.  Well, I didn't give you a good answer because I'm mad.  That wasn't a good question.  That's a tough question to ask me right now.  What is my opinion of his performance?  I mean, you want me to tell you what my opinion of his performance is, isn't it?  I just did.  That's right.  F***ing.  Guy hits three home runs against us.  F***ing.  F***ing.  He was pissed off. 
[02:07:30]  You know what's great about those press conferences?  When a coach or something starts cursing, the reporters just sit there and take it.  Yeah.  If someone's cursing you out, aren't you going to be like, well, f*** you too?  Lighten up.  I'm just asking a f***ing question.  Really, man?  Well, go f*** yourself.  Asshole.  Good.  Sorry, I pissed you off.  Kingman, Kingman, Kingman.  Good.  But they just sit there and take it.  They can freeze him out or something.  They're so scared of those dudes.  And that was a compliment to Kingman, by the way.  Right?  Yeah.  Him going, that f***ing guy's a beast.  But I'm sure...  He took three home runs against us.  I'm sure the next game he struck out five times. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  So that was...  That's my point with this.  So he was just swinging for the fences.  Every single time.  So where's he at the home run list?  I haven't thought about Kingman in a while.  Travis, what's the stats on him?  I think he ended up getting hurt or something.  He had pretty impressive numbers and then he fell off.  I don't remember how many he ended up with.  He had 442 runs.  400.  I mean, that's really good.  That's respectable.  Have you ever heard the Earl Weaver one?  Yeah, we've played that one a few times.  I don't... 
[02:08:30]  Can we do it for the trees?  I know we play this a lot.  The Earl Weaver one is classic.  You got it, Travis?  Now, the manager's corner.  With the thoughts and opinions of the American League's winning as manager,  the Orioles Earl Weaver.  Today's show is sponsored by Baltimore's Six Best,  your area Oldsmobile dealer.  Anderson Olds,  Schaefer and Storminger Olds,  Lee Oldsmobile,  Metro Olds,  City Olds,  and Stuberger Olds.  And now,  to the manager's corner with Earl Weaver. 
[02:09:00]  Well, Bill Whitehouse, Earl,  that certainly is an answer from Frederick Merrill,  wants to know why you and the Orioles don't go out and get some more team speed.  Team speed, for Christ's sake.  You get fucking goddamn little fleas on a fucking basis,  getting picked off,  trying to steal,  getting thrown out,  taking runs away from you.  You get them big cocksuckers that can hit the fucking ball out of the ballpark,  and you can't make any goddamn mistake.  Well, certainly, this show is going to get out in history, Earl.  Terry Elliott of Washington, D.C., 
[02:09:30]  wants to know why you don't use Terry Crowley  as a designated hitter all the time.  Well, Terry Crowley's lucky he's in fucking baseball, for Christ's sake.  He was released by the Cincinnati Reds.  He was released by the fucking goddamn Atlanta Braves.  We saw that Terry Crowley could sit on his fucking ass for eight innings  and enjoy watching a baseball game, just like any other fan,  and has the ability to get up there and break one open in the fucking night.  So if this cocksucker didn't mind his own business and let me manage the fucking team,  we'd be a lot better off.  Well, certainly, you've made your opinions known on the fans' questions about baseball, Earl, 
[02:10:00]  but let's get to something else.  Alice Sweet from Norfolk wants to know the best time to put in a tomato plant.  Alice Sweet ought to be worried about where the fuck her next lane's coming from,  rather than where her next goddamn tomato plant's coming from.  If she'd get her ass out to fucking bars at night and go hustling around the goddamn street,  she might get a prick stuck in her once in a while.  I don't understand where these questions are coming from, Tom.  That's about it from Manager's Corner.  Go fuck yourself and the fuck with your show coming up next on the Baltimore Oriole Baseball fucking Network. 
[02:10:30]  Like, shut Patrice up.  Could you imagine if a manager said that today?  That's the greatest thing I've ever fucking heard.  Like, today, would he be gone by this afternoon?  Oh my god, gone.  But the thing that would get him in trouble would be that last one.  The other two would be fine if he just, what you call, a cocksucker.  Because the Puerto Rican guy from the White Sox is just as bad. 
[02:11:00]  I mean, he's a motherfucker, man.  He's just a crazy shit.  Wow, is that great?  But did he get fired?  No, he didn't get fired.  He's like the most celebrated manager in Oriole history.  That was the good old days.  Oh my god, is he loved.  Oh yeah.  He's in the whole thing.  Travis also has a clip.  Fuck it, we don't have to break.  Travis also has a clip of Weaver arguing with an umpire.  Oh, nice.  Okay.  Have we played that one?  I think we've played it a long time ago, but we don't.  Let's take a listen to this. 
[02:11:30]  Behind the rubber.  Oh, he's got to go behind.  He didn't have to go behind the rubber.  For me, he didn't.  How are you doing to listen to him?  He did not.  Oh, I ain't listening to him, Eddie.  Oh, that's bullshit.  Behind the rubber.  Oh, bullshit.  Bullshit yourself.  You're here.  And this crew is here just to fuck us.  Ha.  Yeah.  Boom.  That's good.  That's great.  And you shot me.  Ah, you shit.  She's been late to get me out of here.  Ah, Earl.  You run yourself, Earl.  You run yourself.  Get your finger off of me.  You hit me?  Yeah, because you put your finger on me. 
[02:12:00]  I'm glad you hit me.  That's right.  That's right.  You're here for one goddamn specific reason.  What's that, Earl?  To fuck us.  Ah, you're a good shit.  Fuck us.  Fuck you.  Goddamn years and years.  And don't you ever put your finger on me.  You hit me, Earl.  You put your finger on me.  That's okay.  I'm damn right.  I didn't.  You ain't gonna knock nobody on his ass.  You do it again and I'll knock you right in your nose.  I didn't touch it.  You pushed your finger on me.  I did not.  Now you're lying. 
[02:12:30]  You're lying.  No, you are.  You are lying, Earl.  You're a big liar if you can't.  You are a liar, Earl.  You are.  I'm a liar.  You are.  You're here for one reason to fuck us good.  Wrong.  That's the only reason you're here.  You are wrong, Earl.  And you'll have your chance tomorrow.  You got it as quick as you can.  What is wrong with you?  You ain't no good.  No, you aren't either.  You ain't no good.  You're no fucking good either.  Your ass will never have our games.  I hope.  What do I care?  Yeah, what do I care? 
[02:13:00]  What are you doing here now?  Well, why don't you call the league office and ask him?  Yeah, I will.  Oh, good.  Don't think I won't.  Good.  And the quicker you get on it, it'll be better, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  You ain't going nowhere.  You aren't either.  You don't have about five, ten fucking years to know who's in the Hall of Fame.  Well, you're going to be in the Hall of Fame.  You know it.  Why?  You know it.  We're fucking up World Series?  You know it.  You're going to be in the Hall of Fame?  We're fucking up World Series?  You know it.  I've won more than I've lost, kid.  I know you haven't.  Games. 
[02:13:30]  Count games.  You don't even know what I'm saying.  You better get going, Earl.  I better get going.  You better get going.  What the hell are you doing?  That's the truth that you had your hands on.  No, that's wrong, Earl.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Oh, God.  For what?  For fucking up World Series?  God, but oh.  Wow.  And that was just in front of a packed fucking stadium.  That was like two kids.  And how great is it that the ump went with it? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  That he goes, go fuck yourself.  That would never happen now.  No.  There would be all sorts of problems.  That would never happen now.  There would be so many problems if that happened.  He'd throw him out in a second.  Right.  The guy'd get thrown out in a fucking second.  Earl Weaver would be suspended.  I'm sure he wasn't suspended for that.  Then there wasn't?  No, of course not.  No, that's how they used to.  He used to take rule books out to the umpires and just rip them up and throw them in his face.  And he would take his hat and he would turn it around so he could get closer to the ump's face.  Did he win championships?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, he did.  God, is that funny, man. 
[02:14:30]  Earl Weaver rule.  I love all this stuff in sports.  Bring back more of this.  By the way, just so we have the Kingman info, right?  Sean Kelly from Massapequa writes,  Oh, Kingman did not drop off.  He hit 35 home runs his last year at the A's.  Then he was a free agent.  He was such a legendary prick.  He was a prick.  That no one wanted to re-sign him.  Oh, is that why?  So then he had to just fade away.  Wow.  No one wanted him at that point.  All right.  You still want to play the George Carlin thing?  Might as well, right?  It's a great piece.  Patrice, you promoting anything? 
[02:15:00]  Just hanging?  Got your Comedy Central thing down the road?  Yeah.  Which is very exciting.  We're all happy for you.  Trying to get Jack Black and Tracy Morgan's phone number so I can hang out with them.  Really?  I'm fucking with you.  Tracy's everywhere now.  I know.  Tracy's everywhere now.  Fucking assholes.  They need to get that shit.  You only bitch about that forever.  I'm trying to just do that bullshit.  No.  Trying to have to get on a plane ever again.  We're over the Tracy thing.  I mean, you know, he used to do our show and now he doesn't want to do it anymore.  He's a big star.  Acting lesson. 
[02:15:30]  Stancing lesson.  Chris Rock next up.  Yeah, I got to hear that shit.  The Letterman thing is really good audio.  But first this.  Opie and Anthony, busy show.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  We got Mike Verbiglia coming in to say hi.  And Taylor Vixen, Penthouse Pet of the Year in studio. 
[02:16:00]  Yes.  I think we're going to break out one of our old bits.  We'll film it.  We'll throw it up on some fucking website.  Booble Lantern.  Might do a little boo-boo Lantern with her big fucking orbs.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  She got implants?  I do believe.  Because that's the only way that works.  Chris Rock on Letterman.  Let's get right into this.  So everyone's been skating around the Letterman controversy.  Chris Rock goes on the show and wow. 
[02:16:30]  Some good fucking TV.  Simple as that.  He went at him, huh?  Let's take a listen.  I wish I could see it.  Dave.  How you doing?  What the hell happened to your voice, Dave?  I don't know.  It's just gone.  What the hell?  You sound like an old ass man, Dave.  At my age, the warranty begins to run out.  What the hell?  Yeah, I don't know.  Things going bad, huh?  Oh.  And people say, well, do you feel all right otherwise?  No, I feel like hell otherwise. 
[02:17:00]  Damn, man.  And you're still doing the show?  Well, more or less.  Wow.  I don't know that it would hold up in court.  Oh.  You're a rich man.  You could just go home.  Why am I going to drive back to Connecticut to a mean woman? 
[02:17:30]  I might as well just stay here and do the show with no voice.  I love you, honey.  I've been there, Dave.  Is that right?  I've been there.  I've been in the cave, baby.  Now, wow.  That was tastefully, because no one fucks with him, but that was tastefully done there.  That's Chris Rock, man.  He's got a way of doing it, right? 
[02:18:00]  That was done well.  That was done well.  Obviously, Letterman trying to move on gave him his couple shots there.  Said, oh, fuck it.  You know, I got to take it a little bit.  Trying to move on, but, well, that didn't happen at all.  Well, now, tell me about you.  I know the last time you were here, you're just about to go on a world tour or just finished  a world tour.  How do you do that?  How do I tour, Dave?  Do you ever get sick when you're out there on the road?  I do get sick, Dave.  And if my wife is mad at me, I just add on shows.  I just add on. 
[02:18:30]  You're going.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to do Roanoke next week.  What the hell am I coming home to a bad woman for?  I understand.  Well, it's rough, Dave.  Yeah, yeah.  Not much I can say here.  I know.  I went up backstage and fired all the cute girls.  You got a bunch of fat old guys back there.  The whole. 
[02:19:00]  You have great riffs, man.  You have genius.  It's horrible, man.  The vibe is just horrible, man.  The band can't take it no more.  I'll tell you something.  Some of those guys are starting to look pretty good.  God, that's some good TV right now.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:19:30]  And Dave's a dude, man.  He's like, oh, boy.  But he still had to go.  That last one.  He had to run with it.  Yeah, yeah.  He's such a dude, man.  Like, I like Letterman, man, a lot.  Yeah, he couldn't just sit there and take it.  He had to, like, get involved a little bit.  Yeah, they're starting to look good.  Like, that's dude shit, man.  And all the cute girls.  And you know that part was probably shit, because he's probably back there like,  what the fuck?  A fat PA?  PAs are always little cutie pies. 
[02:20:00]  Hi, man.  Hi, Mr. Rock.  Would you like to follow me?  Delicious little whore.  That was like some fucking fat dude.  Fucking, yeah, William Frawley.  But he did that well.  Not one, really, for real, not one uncomfortable moment there.  No, no, it was funny.  Yeah, it was not even perfect.  It was right there.  It was genuinely right there.  Perfect.  It was right there.  It took Letterman to go, ah.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he knew, but at the end of the day, he really didn't take a bash, and it was... 
[02:20:30]  And no audience groans.  No, like, oh.  It was a...  Because it was all based on...  It was inside jokes.  Yeah.  But it was all based on...  It was very well done.  It was very well done, man.  Yeah.  He didn't make an enemy, I don't think.  Nah.  It was smart.  Nah.  Smart move.  Yeah, because no one else does it.  No one else is fucking saying, hey, Dave.  Dave should have every cheater on his show every week.  Jesse James should be on this week.  Tiger Woods should have been on.  Cheat Week.  Yeah.  Cheat Week.  Yeah, just go with it, right?  Yeah, Cheat Week.  I fucking love Chris Rock. 
[02:21:00]  God damn, I love that guy.  That was actually really good, yeah, man.  He hasn't really changed his tune over the years, either.  He's still that same guy, right?  Chris?  Seems like it.  I don't know.  Mom, I'm just saying, seems like it.  I guess I am.  Yeah, I don't know.  Still bummed?  Didn't he tell you what was wrong with you?  Oh, no.  I was never bummed about that.  I actually appreciate him for saying that, because they don't say that.  They wouldn't say that...  To your face.  Yeah, no one would say that.  That was actually a great thing, you know?  That was an amazing moment on our show.  Chris Rock telling Patrice how he's blowing up some spots for himself. 
[02:21:30]  He didn't really say that.  He basically was saying, I've never had a problem with Chris Rock.  No, he wasn't saying that.  No, but he, I didn't get the part because he had a problem.  Like, he, it was, it was perceived that I'm a...  There was a perception.  There's a perception.  And he lets you know that.  Yeah, there's a perception.  But he ran with the perception.  So he needed ball to that motherfucker.  He didn't, he wasn't irreverent enough to stand up and hire me after he told me I was the best  read, that cocksucker. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, right.  There you go.  Fuck that fucking lima bean head motherfucker.  All right, there you go.  But at the end of the day, you know, I appreciate him for, you know, being that honest.  All right.  There it is.  Fucking treat me like a white boy.  Fucking Mr. O'Neal.  But in his Chris Rock voice, you can't get the job.  Because you're crazy.  Shut up, nigga.  Because you're crazy.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Oh, fuck.  Holy shit.  But I, but I never, I never was upset about that.  That was, that was actually, kudos. 
[02:22:30]  I liked him for that.  I actually liked him.  It was a good day of radio.  Wow.  Yeah, I enjoyed him for something like that.  That was pretty good.  Hey, someone on the phone is suggesting we play the Hank, I think his name was Hank Johnson.  The Hank Johnson clip for Patrice about the Guam Island.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Do we have that, E-Rock?  If you could run it down, that would be great.  If you're listening to the show.  Well, just because Patrice is black.  Well, I guess.  And the politician was black.  I guess.  My God.  Well, I don't know what it is, so I don't know.  Can we just be people? 
[02:23:00]  I think, I think just being people is worth playing for Patrice.  I'm kidding, of course.  I'm a fucking raging racist.  One of our fucking representatives saying just some dumb shit about Guam.  Really dumb shit.  I don't even want to say what he said.  I want you to hear it cold.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Now, Guam is Asians.  Isn't Guam Asians?  It's not African, is it?  Guam is South Pacific.  Asian.  It's Asian, like Polynesian type of thing.  Yeah, yeah, shit like that.  Yeah, more like natives. 
[02:23:30]  You know?  More like them.  More like Bikini Island kind of people.  More like a bunch of Jimmy Schnooker.  Superfly.  Ah, Superfly.  The Superfly Jimmy Schnooker.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Back in the fucking 40s and shit, testing out those goddamn bombs, we'd just take a bunch  of people from an island, like Bikini Island, and transfer them to some other island and  go, no, will you get your island back? 
[02:24:00]  You know?  And they've been there for fucking forever.  Since dinosaurs, basically.  Before recorded history.  And they go, yeah, we need your island.  We got to test out some shit.  And they're smiling and giving their native food to the military and everything, and it's  all great.  So they ship them off to another island, they blow up Bikini Island with a fucking hydrogen  bomb, and then bring them all back to just fucking get irradiated, with now a giant chunk  of the island just missing. 
[02:24:30]  It's a big lagoon in the middle.  That explains their faces.  Jesus.  I don't even know what that means.  They were kind of Polynesian looking.  Very nice.  Very peaceful people.  And I'm a big fan of those people ever since I've seen Mel Gibson's...  Dude, how hot are the Tahitians?  Everyone talks about that movie.  Like, I was bringing that up the other day.  It makes me fall in love.  Tahitian girls are just the shit.  What is it, Apopalipto?  No, not Apopalipto.  What are you talking about?  No, that was Mutiny on the Bounty.  Mutiny on the Bounty.  Just Bounty, it was called.  Bounty. 
[02:25:00]  And just those hot girls.  How hot is his fucking girl in there?  Mel Gibson's chick?  It's the only non-porn movie that I just watch in a porn way.  Walk around, they're just all topless.  They're all topless, walking around, looking fucking fantastic.  I'm a big fan of that.  You've never seen Bounty?  I don't think so.  Oh my god.  Yeah, that's a good one.  There's movies I saw so many years ago, I forgot I saw them.  Anthony Hawkins' Captain Blight.  Yeah, I don't think I've seen it. 
[02:25:30]  I'll have to do it.  Let's check that one out.  He's just showing a clip of us blowing their fucking island to shit.  I want to find the clip of the general talking to the natives.  Yeah, and they had to run through a translator, and so the translator is trying to tell them  that we're going to move you to another island while we make nuclear bomb explosions happen here.  But don't worry, because it's for the good of mankind.  What you'll see here at Operation Crossroads is a giant flash, and then a cloud of flame and smoke that will rise up to the heavens. 
[02:26:00]  We will then return you back to your native home completely unharved.  Actually better for the experience.  As your hair falls out, and you grow tumors over every part of your body, and have eight-headed children.  They didn't know, though.  They didn't know.  No one knew.  How does this country historically get away with this?  How do we get away with some great historic shit? 
[02:26:30]  How do we, how do, listen.  And we're all based on morality.  How do you go anywhere?  How does an American go anywhere, or this country go anywhere, where we've done things to people?  And like, even Japan, we go there, and you try to have a conversation with a Japanese person,  and they don't look at you and go, oh, hold up, man.  Hold up.  Really, Hiroshima, for real?  Nakasaka?  He blew our shit.  Adam bombs?  Like, my kids, man.  My son has one ball because of you.  My grandson has one ball because of you. 
[02:27:00]  And then you answer him, going, and then you should have stayed out of Pearl Harbor, motherfucker.  No, but not, but see, not even just Japan.  Like, how do you move on to the next conversation?  Easily.  With the shit we've done to this fucking world.  Easily you go, do you like your new subway system?  Yeah, that's true.  Reconstruction.  We rebuilt that shit.  They got the nicest shit because of all that going on.  Yeah, when we conquer.  Guam?  Well, maybe not Guam.  That's what I mean.  We're talking more Japan stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I should have said somewhere, someone else. 
[02:27:30]  Like, I'm just saying the stuff.  The stuff.  The stuff.  Like South American, some South American countries that we've just inserted people as leaders into.  I mean, the stuff we, look, 9-11 was fucked up.  We know that's fucked up.  But in context of the shit I just saw on TV the other day with that look like Modern Warfare 2, but it was real people in it.  Oh, shit.  Man, was that fucked up?  And it was innocent bystanders at the end of the day?  There were two reporters in there, but they were, you know, something. 
[02:28:00]  Did you just say the word, eh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what?  It was two douchebags just standing around.  You get two fucking reporters, and they're embedded with people with fucking guns.  There's going to be some shit.  It could happen.  They look like they were standing, even if they were insurgents.  They all look like they were standing around telling two Jews in a bar jokes.  Because they can't see our shit coming at them.  They didn't even.  They can't see it coming.  The most they had was those cigarette lighters that looked like a match. 
[02:28:30]  They didn't have anything.  That guy had an RPG.  We do some fucked up shit to people.  And you just watch them all explode.  We do fucked up shit to us.  By the way, I just bought a thing called Zero Water.  Works fantastically, by the way.  What's Zero Water?  It's a, I don't know how new it is, but it takes all the bullshit.  It's like a Brita, but it has a filter that looks like your fucking thing right here. 
[02:29:00]  You have a fucking megaphone?  Take a megaphone.  Absolute fact works.  Takes out all the bullshit out your water.  Your water's crystal deliciously clean.  So I would say, advise.  Did you buy it from Adam Farrar?  No, I bought it from Bath & Beyond sells it.  How do you know it's better water?  It fucking has all the horse shit that's in water.  How do you know?  What do you mean how I know?  How do you know?  Can you see it?  Can you see it?  Does it taste better?  Well, how do you know? 
[02:29:30]  Wait a second, I saw a couple, there's a few things on the internet.  It's called, and here's how great they are to you.  Are they ionizing it?  They give you a monitor, the water tester, the shit in your water tester.  It's called TDS, Total Dissolved Solids, thank you, sir.  And all the shit that you don't see that's just in the water chilling, takes that out till  your water's zero.  And then they say, put this in?  No, to test the water. 
[02:30:00]  To test the water, yeah.  Ask for these poor motherfuckers.  Does it taste better?  Absolutely.  I'm just letting you know.  Zero water.  And that's just for the fact that the shit, that fluoride, they do shit, basically saying  that they do that shit for us, too.  They do fucked up shit to us, whoever they are.  So at least they don't just drop a bomb in Jersey City.  Let's listen to some of this Bikini Island discussion.  Propaganda.  They're talking to a bunch of natives that probably don't even know what fucking, they 
[02:30:30]  just learned fire last week.  They have no clue what nuclear is.  So the translator is Troy Polamalu.  Oh, look at how cute she is.  She's getting blown up.  Beautiful she is.  Jesus.  Although they don't understand the world of nuclear energy.  Now this is before, after the bomb.  This is before.  Okay, this is what they look like before.  Yeah.  Understanding what the test is all about.  And they're just laughing at the white man. 
[02:31:00]  Now he tells them.  Go ahead, James.  I want to tell them that the Commodores explain the atomic bomb.  Explain.  Just go to an anthill and talk to ants.  You can't discuss atomic energy in this language.  They live in huts and he's like, all right, explain the atomic bomb.  Yeah, go ahead.  The United States government now wants to turn this great destructive force into something 
[02:31:30]  good for mankind.  Oh, my God.  These experiments here at Bikini are the first step in that direction.  I'm a military government.  What a bunch of bullshit, this motherfucker.  Run for your life.  Pick up a rock or a stick and beat these people about their heads in their sleep.  Will you take a dismount hostage?  It's our only chance.  For their evacuation, will you ask King Judah to get up and tell us now what his people 
[02:32:00]  think and if they're willing to go?  Yeah.  Do you understand?  Okay.  I come in here.  It seems pretty normal.  You know, I come in.  Motherfuckers are all racing.  This seems normal.  Did you see why no one likes white man?  Now, first of all, he's talking to his, the guy, like a fucking, like he's an idiot monkey.  Like he's like, and then tell them, stupid gorilla, you're fucking as dumb as they are. 
[02:32:30]  Nuclear power.  He's talking to him without any respect for this man's intelligence.  Not at all.  That he's fucking actually talking and he's translating.  He's talking to the translator like a fucking idiot.  He really is.  That's fantastic.  He on the duck fucking.  We are going to turn this around here.  Don't fire in arrogance, man.  For the good of mankind by completely obliterating your atoll. 
[02:33:00]  Why do white people get angry?  And again, not all white people should because there's a trucker, listen here, that I'm not  including in the insidious white man conversation, but he embraces it like I am, right?  At the end of the day, why the fuck, white people should hate motherfuckers like this?  You know why?  I'll tell you why.  Because we figured out how to make the fucking bomb.  Oh, shit.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  So there's an entitlement issue.  Einstein did.  You got him before the Germans. 
[02:33:30]  The Germans fucked up.  They fucking were killing all their Jewish scientists or putting them in slave camps.  And they all came over here.  It's not necessarily with our technology.  More than Einstein.  Einstein just knew it was possible.  You have people like Oppenheimer and shit like that.  Wait, say that name again?  Oppenheimer.  Exactly.  It's all the same.  It's a good fund.  I was part of the Oppenheimer Fund for a while.  But they were the people that actually made it work. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah, the Manhattan Project, right?  Yeah, they made it work.  It was all those Jews.  But at the end of the day, why do people, white people, this is why it's so amazing how  they do, how whoever is out there making us hate each other can put some regular white  guy who's living in a hut like these people here in fucking Kentucky, how he can be as  angry because you don't like white people.  Like, he's this guy.  Like, he's this general.  He should fucking hate this guy. 
[02:34:30]  I know.  But he's on his side because he has white skin.  Right.  He's the same color.  But he has nothing to do with this fucker who is, he's just destroying an island.  And he's talking to one guy like, if I was translating, like, say, hood language, ebonics, for some  niggas sitting there that the police was getting ready to blow up Brooklyn.  And he's just like, nigga, can you tell them that we will be for the betterment?  Yes. 
[02:35:00]  I'll be like, this nigga is going to blow up your house.  And it's all for the better of mankind.  And it's for the better of you.  Suck a dick, motherfucker.  Hey, yo, Chris, grab this nigga.  It looks like.  Oh, is that great?  It's just crazy.  Look, I got to hear more of that.  All right.  I got to hear more of this.  Douchebag, man.  It's hard to hear, but.  He's talking to the king.  Have the king come up and ask. 
[02:35:30]  Now he's asking the people if they want to go.  Everything's in God's hands.  That everything being in God's hands, it cannot be other than good.  Fucking piece of shit.  And that means Patrice can't go more than a minute with this without getting so pissed off. 
[02:36:00]  He's a nothing fucking asshole.  It is a little rough.  To him.  You see all those pictures of those beautiful fucking broads.  Yes.  Right?  Good looking women.  Yeah.  He looks at them with general monkey eyes.  Like, he's like, he's not even looking at these little tenderloins like, God, they're  beautiful.  He's like, we're going to blow all these silly fucking slit-eyed monkeys to goddamn hell.  He doesn't even look at them like, man, these motherfuckers are more delicious looking than 
[02:36:30]  my rotten old white wife at home.  He's fucking looking at all of them like they ain't shit.  You got to think he takes one aside for a snack.  Of course.  He takes one.  Of course there's a fucking raping.  What are you fucking...  What are you fucking homosexual, Taylor?  He fucking...  Of course he's...  They're raping and pillaging, but they're not looking at these...  Like, when I look at Bounty, I go, God damn, look at these women.  Yeah.  Like, in some old, I want to make sure you're fucking not hurt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He went here and nothing deterred him from his mission of God to destroy this island. 
[02:37:00]  You know he gave the king a Zippo and got, like, three of those girls to come to his fucking  little hut at night for a Zippo lighter.  Why not practice, right, on your bombs that you made?  Why not practice on Nagasaki since he was going to bomb them anyway?  Just practice on the places that were going to die anyway.  They needed to know how this was going to affect battleships and whatnot, so what they did  was they tied up a bunch of...  They anchored a bunch of ships around the island and then blew the fucking island up. 
[02:37:30]  And they put live pigs on the boats and on the ships to see what the effect would be  on flesh and organs.  And they show them loading them into trucks, just split open.  Ready?  Jesus.  And they still dropped it on Hiroshima.  Do you understand?  They still did it?  Yeah, this, I think, was after.  They found out that the pigs went in, pigs came out, an absolute dinner.  They came out bacon.  They came out bacon. 
[02:38:00]  And not even bacon.  Worse than bacon.  Bacon.  Just bacon.  Regulatory bacon.  When it's going...  It's going...  It's a good film.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We can continue with this, but we've got to get Mike Birbiglia in and Taylor Vickson  the Penthouse Pet of the Year.  And we still have the Guam clip.  All right.  We want to play the Guam clip for you, Patrice.  We'll do that after the break.  Busy show today. 
[02:38:30]  Patrice O'Neill in studio, killing for us.  So this is that.  Mike.  Talking about the war, the big war.  Hey, been there.  And now Mike Birbiglia has entered the studio.  Hi, Mikey.  What's going on?  I'm looking at a penthouse.  Yeah, apparently we've got a penthouse pet.  Pet of the Year.  Wow.  Ooh.  Mikey's playing Carolines tonight and tomorrow.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  We're a little distracted. 
[02:39:00]  It's Taylor Vickson, right?  Pet of the Year?  Yeah.  Pet of the Year.  That's not her.  She used to work for us.  Where's she going to sit?  Where's she sit here?  What do we got?  Oh, wow.  There I am.  What do you want to shoot?  Hey, I remember you.  What are you doing now?  She works for Carolines, yeah.  Oh, really?  I remember you.  You don't like cotton.  No.  Yeah.  Our old intern, Jill, is in the studio, too, because she works for Carolines.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  And then we got...  Ooh.  Hi, Taylor.  What have we got here?  Yeah.  What's up, Taylor?  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  Pet of the Year, huh?  Yes.  Let's see a little bit so I can get a look-see.  Hi.  She's young.  Hi.  How young are you?  Me, I'm 26.  26?  You look younger than 26.  It's a good thing, right?  It's something right, yes.  She gets proofed everywhere, right?  You get what?  You get proofed everywhere, carded?  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  That's a good thing.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:40:00]  You know, you're young looking.  Taylor Vixen is a real name?  Yeah.  Taylor Vixen?  Taylor Vixen is a real name.  Where, where, what part of our great land do you hail from?  I'm from Dallas, Texas.  Ah, Texas girl.  You got guns?  You carry?  I don't.  No.  No?  Spend some time in Dallas and all the, all the women have, you know, little guns in there.  They have a little gun.  They have a little gun.  They have a little gun.  They have a little gun.  They have little purses and everything.  They usually leave them in the glove box because, you know, they don't want to, everyone's 
[02:40:30]  packing heat.  Well, I moved to L.A. in July.  Oh, there's more guns there.  There are?  Yeah.  Illegally.  Yeah, you got the illegal guns in L.A.  See, Texas, you're allowed to have them.  L.A., there's more, but you're not.  So, gun control really works.  Yeah, I know guns aren't allowed in L.A.  Yeah.  So, now, what, what criteria is there for becoming pet of the year?  What criteria?  Yeah, like, what makes you better than one of the other girls that, like, went, oh,  shit, I missed out?  I think it has to do with, obviously, the first looks.  Yeah.  Whatever they're looking for at the time. 
[02:41:00]  Nice boobs, nice body, and then I think it comes with personality, too.  You think so?  To be able to talk to people.  To be able to communicate with people, yeah.  Yeah, I guess you have to be able to do that.  That is a big requisite, I've heard.  It is.  To simply focus on that.  Yeah, I don't think the personality is as important as a nice snatch.  Agreed.  Wow.  Oh, and you got a little hair down there.  Nice.  Oh, is that coming back a little bit?  I think it is.  I think it is, huh?  I love it.  See, I'm a pioneer in that, by the way.  I was talking about hair coming back years ago.  A couple years ago, Ann. 
[02:41:30]  You're right.  Because everybody just started shaving.  Okay, everyone started shaving their pussies completely bare clean.  They did.  How recently did this happen?  Oh, my God.  This has been happening for years and years.  I'm like, oh, my poor bastard.  Yeah.  It looks like raw chicken thighs.  Yeah, I know.  I like my pussy to be adult.  I need something in the hair.  You need a little hair, Patrice.  I like a lot of hair.  A lot.  Like a problem hair.  Just a lot.  I like it.  Come down the thigh. 
[02:42:00]  It looks like a pussy.  That other shit looks like trying to do something.  That's what I want.  You know, and some pussies are very, very attractive, shaved.  Others, not so much.  Need a little camouflage.  I like a...  I like, you know, the basic natural triangular shape kind of thing.  I don't want a V.  It's got to be like...  I want it to look like fucking Italy on the map.  Just like...  Italy.  Good pussy hair right there.  That is...  Perfect.  Stop, Patrice.  That's perfection.  That is horrendous.  That looks like...  Is that her? 
[02:42:30]  She's never shit.  It looks like an adult.  No, that's not her, Mike.  She's got hairy armpits, too, that girl.  That's fine.  That girl's fine.  That would be too much hair right there.  That's a little much.  Kelly Vixen?  That's a little too much hair.  A little too much?  Is that just kind of a standard vagina sample that you put up on the screen?  Yeah, that's just a random sample of a vagina.  Yeah, just a...  National Geographic.  What is it called?  Yeah, the...  Yeah.  I actually like looking at a girl completely nude with some hair there and doesn't even 
[02:43:00]  have to be doing the spread eagle thing.  Just standing there kind of looks cool, you know?  It's like the girl that got out of the tub before it's turned into the old bitch in  the shining.  You know, a perfect...  I think they should not reverse it.  Because when you think about hair, a lot of women shave the lip part and leave the...  I think they should shave the hump part and have just a hairy lip and clitoris area.  You know, that may be the next trendsetter you're starting at.  You like hair around the asshole, Patrice? 
[02:43:30]  Doesn't bother me one fucking bit.  Nah.  There you go.  I don't know what hair is supposed to represent it.  I mean, it's supposed to be there because it grows.  You are lovely.  Is that you?  Yes.  Well, why are we...  That's a large poster.  That is a big, big centerfoldy poster thingy.  Wow.  All you have to do is put all...  It's like eight pages wide and tall and everything.  You can put this on your bed and then put like...  Oh, my God.  You know what you could do?  Life size.  You could put a pillow...  You could wrap it around a pillow.  Yeah.  You could put a pillow down and then... 
[02:44:00]  Damn.  Yeah.  You could have sex with Taylor Vixen, sort of.  You think about that, guys, what they're doing?  Oh, I bet they're wrapping that around a pillow.  Yeah.  I know.  I know some are.  Spanking it.  Like that.  When did you start taking your clothes off?  Last March.  That's it?  Jesus.  That's it.  Like in the February, March.  What were you doing before that?  I worked for a healthcare company for like a couple years and then I bartended in Dallas.  Probably made some good tips there, I bet, right?  I did.  You've had a hell of a...  Wait.  She's had a hell of a year then. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, really?  I've had a really crazy year.  Take your clothes off just to...  See, ladies, you got to take your clothes off.  Way better than working for a healthcare provider.  They should have had you.  I always said that.  I think that's a smart thing.  If I could go back, come back as a beautiful young woman.  Oh, yeah.  What you do is you have no integrity from the age of 18.  Wait.  No, I'm not saying that.  You just say fuck pride and all that.  You take your clothes off and then you have pride when no one wants to fuck you anymore. 
[02:45:00]  Right, right.  When you're 50.  Then you better yourself.  You do it backwards.  Right.  Go to school.  Fuck him with you.  Yeah, just fucking take your clothes off because in reality, the fact that women are always  trying to force us to not objectify them is really like, yeah, you know.  Yeah.  You're an object anyway.  I'm still trying to figure out what you look like with no clothes on.  Yeah, that is what guys will do at any given moment with an attractive girl is try to figure  out what she looks like with no clothes on.  Yeah, whatever the fuck I want to...  I don't even care if she can read or write or nothing. 
[02:45:30]  Listen, you meet a sexy bitch that goes, you know, I'm clinically and legally dumb.  Good for you, stupid.  Good for you, stupid.  Jesus, Danny.  What picture are you putting up there?  Danny's finding hairy asshole pictures.  Like, look, man.  That's too much.  No, that's too much.  I mean, that's not even...  That's man hair.  Yeah, that's fetish.  I'm talking about like a chick, you know.  Oh, Jesus.  Like, that's too much, but...  All right, well...  Yeah.  What are your responsibilities as Penthouse Pet of the Year? 
[02:46:00]  I do a lot.  Do you have to go to children's hospitals?  I go to children's hospitals.  I donate my toys to Toys R Us.  I don't know.  No.  Oh, that's sweet.  I do a lot of appearances, do some of the Penthouse Key Clubs conventions.  So you're dancing out there as a feature?  I...  No, I'm not.  No, she's too classy.  What do you do at the clubs?  Sign books?  It just depends.  Like, we had a club opening in Philly, so I did that. 
[02:46:30]  And we all go there and just meet people, meet everyone that comes to the club.  Oh, okay.  And yes, I do sign, like...  I have like eight attends, and then we give them out, and we sign them for everybody.  I think this is a genius interview, by the way, because this shows you, like, this is  basically a blind date or first date.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And this is what guys have to go through.  Like, this is where you have to fucking find shit.  Like, so...  Like, so...  Do you like green tea?  Yes, I do.  This is the right thing. 
[02:47:00]  Waiter!  Waiter!  You're so right.  You're so right for drinks.  Can you give me another glass of give a fuck?  You're so right.  With extra help?  You're so right, man.  I'm just trying to have a conversation with a young lady.  No, no, no, but I'm saying, you know, this is just fantastic, because this is what you  have...  As a guy...  It is, absolutely, yeah.  She brings...  No offense.  She brings...  She brings that... 
[02:47:30]  I don't think this is gonna be good.  ...that poster...  No, no, this is all women.  Yeah.  Essentially, you bring that poster to the table.  You just bring delicious little vagina, nice breast, beautiful face.  Yeah.  26 years old.  Mm-hmm.  And I bring the rest.  Yeah.  The rest.  Like, for real, and no offense again, I'm saying...  Every time he says no offense.  That should be...  That should be...  But this is not offensive.  This is just why guys...  Just talking about why motherfucking people hate white people, because of this Guam thing. 
[02:48:00]  Why guys don't like women is like, okay, you are a something-year-old man with pedigree.  Famous!  And you're doing all the groundwork of keeping a conversation.  And that's men in general.  That we have to do all the fucking work.  The scales have to balance out somehow.  What's the balance?  The beautiful vagina and titties.  The fact that... 
[02:48:30]  The fact that this conversation...  The fact that you may have sex.  I mean, not with...  But just in general with the girl.  Oh, it would be...  Right, right.  If you're out...  The fact that all is...  She gets emotionally attached to this.  This isn't always true.  I think that the best woman to date, I find, is someone who...  No offense.  Someone who...  No, it's not.  I'm not trying to be offensive to her.  I'm kidding.  It's just...  I'm talking about just the dynamic.  I mean, you don't think that this is universally true.  I mean, in a lot of cases, women are not attractive as teenagers. 
[02:49:00]  And then they develop personalities.  And then when they're adults...  And we don't give a fuck about them because...  But no, but then they can carry on a conversation.  And then they become very pretty in their 20s and 30s.  Who...  What ugly...  You've never witnessed this?  I mean, but she's...  What ugly...  What ugly...  No fucking girl.  Look, if I was actually precious, if it was a man precious...  Yeah.  I get...  I get pussy because I'm precious.  She don't get dick because she's precious? 
[02:49:30]  She might have somebody go, congratulations on all the precious shit, but I'm going to fuck  somebody that I can look at.  Really?  You're funny?  Die, bitch!  I don't want to know any funny fat bitches!  Good for you!  Oh, shit!  Well, Patrice, we got a whole sheet of stuff to talk to Taylor about.  So you don't have a sheet on a blind date?  Yeah.  You got a whole sheet.  That's what you...  This is great blind date.  It's like...  You just go so... 
[02:50:00]  She wants a man who gets her hot, wet, and desperate to have him inside of her.  See?  Now, wait.  Now, hold on.  That's, like, elaborate.  Yeah, yeah.  Hold on.  Now, as the penthouse pet, I can understand that shit.  As a girl...  Okay.  As a girl, what are you like in a guy, in a, you know, a date, a relationship?  What is that?  She don't know!  You don't know.  You're creating it!  No, she's not that...  Look.  Look at the sheet. 
[02:50:30]  It's everything that's written from everyone.  I, like...  My turn on.  Sorry.  It's like, no, stop.  Anthony, but the sheet says she just wants a boy who can take charge and make her come  quicker and harder than she could do herself.  Basically, she wants a guy...  Someone wrote that.  No!  Someone wrote that.  All women...  She's a real girl that has real, like, emotions and thoughts.  And her name's not Taylor Vickson.  About cumming and fucking being cocked.  Yes, it is!  No, her name is...  There's gotta be something in that girl that's just like, I like fucking watching some dopey 
[02:51:00]  TV show or sitting on the couch and fucking...  No!  Her most exciting place she had sex was in the back of a cab.  She loved seeing the driver watch them.  She came right as the guy was inside of her.  Sometimes the cab ride is just point A to point B.  Not in this case.  She had sex in the back of a cab.  And fucking prog.  Prog.  Okay, that story is true.  It's elaborated.  But true.  Yeah.  Penthouse publishes everything that's true.  Okay.  I'm not saying...  But to answer your question...  That's actually my number one news star. 
[02:51:30]  I'll answer your question.  I just like a guy that's weird.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Weird, cool, normal, funny.  I'm weird, cool, normal.  I'm funny.  Oh.  That's pretty good.  Where do you live now?  Me?  I live in L.A.  L.A.?  Yes.  Shit.  I'm sorry.  Coast to coast.  Yeah.  I could fly you out.  Okay.  Well, that's a five and a half hour flight.  So...  First class.  It'll do it first class.  Okay.  It goes fast.  Just as long as it's Virgin American, I'm good.  Yeah.  Fuck.  You pick the airline.  I don't care. 
[02:52:00]  Come over the house.  I got a really nice house.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What makes a man sexy for her?  Let's see if you got these qualities in it.  When he's totally self-confident.  Yeah.  He got self-confidence.  That's good.  One for one.  I got that.  He's not jealous and cocky for no reason.  Nah.  There he is.  Nah.  Which is actually...  That's very contradictory.  Yeah, that is contradictory.  I want him to be very confident, but not a dick.  But it's like...  It's the same...  They go together.  It's a balancing act.  Okay.  Here's the line with that, and I'll explain it. 
[02:52:30]  Be nice, but when I'm being a bitch, tell me.  Oh, really?  And then I'll straighten up.  Patrice.  Wow.  That's not...  That's something guys don't normally...  Yeah, that's really...  You don't get a nice guy.  Because I'm sassy, so...  That's a trap with punji steaks.  Like, because...  If I'm nice to you, and everything's going good, and I'm like, well, I'll tell you.  You know, yeah, it's all beautiful.  Let's go out to eat.  And you're yapping.  What point in our relationship do I go, please shut the fuck up?  What point?  What point?  Yeah.  Meaning, as I'm being nice. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, because the reality of that doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  You got to have a guy immediately go, sweetie, first of all.  You know, shut the fuck up.  Yeah, shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  You know what I want to listen to.  Tell me that, I'm like...  That's not on the list.  That's not on the list.  I'm so sorry.  Nice looking at the list.  Anthony.  Anthony, look deeply in her eyes, but quietly.  She likes that.  How do you quietly?  Looking deeply and quietly into her eyes.  She's a little creepy.  She's a little creepy.  She's a little creepy.  How about this?  She don't want your...  Look at it.  Yeah. 
[02:53:30]  She's a control freak, man.  You can tell, because it's like, look into my eyes.  Look into my eyes.  But a 40-year-old guy, I'm 40.  If I look into her, it's uncomfortable.  How, when I'm quiet and looking in her eyes, it's like, you know, this is my, like...  Yeah, that's, I want to fuck your eyes, Patrice.  He's probably doing it.  I can't see it.  Yeah, it has nothing to do with just, it's not quiet.  It's not quiet.  It's uncomfortable.  It's creepy.  Be young and creepy. 
[02:54:00]  Be controllably creepy.  Be controllably confident.  Everything is like...  The thing is, no one could be...  Now, I understand your persona here for Penthouse, which is fine.  But no one is sexual 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  I agree, but I believe everyone thinks about sex pretty much 24-7.  I'm not denying that.  But there are some points where you've got to go shopping.  True.  There are some points where you have to, you know...  You're not just in the supermarket going, yeah, let's fuck in the oatmeal. 
[02:54:30]  True.  There's some things that you probably enjoy doing that have nothing to do with...  I do.  Do you want to know those?  Yeah, let me hear a couple of things that you enjoy doing that have nothing to do with...  I like to go to Runyon Canyon.  Wait a minute.  What the fuck's going on here?  A fucking man, her, would get kicked right in his bones.  Right.  What?  If this was a man's thing...  What the fuck's wrong with you, man?  Like, it's a...  It's like I did...  If a guy goes, yeah, you know what I'm saying?  Find out about the girl. 
[02:55:00]  I did two years of community college.  He gets stabbed in his fucking soul.  Right.  Like, you give a shit that she runs canyons.  I...  Oh, my God.  I don't know now.  Why the fuck would you care about...  I'd be very scared of mountain lions.  Don't you know?  Like, do you care?  This is so curious.  I wish I was a beautiful woman for a week.  Just to know.  Do you know...  Do you know that he...  You know he wants a piece right away, right?  Yeah, but he's going the back way.  He's like, so what do you like? 
[02:55:30]  I'm just trying to find out.  So, I'm not trying to cock block.  I'm just trying to...  Yeah.  So, basically, you're like, okay, you know what?  I know he's coming in trying to fuck.  So, at the end of the day, he's doing the right thing.  It's almost like a car salesman.  You know he's trying to sell you a car, but I like him.  I'll buy that car from him.  Reserting trust.  I would show you a very good time, and then some severe fucking.  But, like, like...  With your giant...  Well, you got, like, an 11-inch log.  Don't you sound ridiculous?  It's not 11-inch, for the record. 
[02:56:00]  He's got a hammer.  It's a monster, right?  He's paying me for it.  But you're his best friend.  Have you seen him?  Ha, ha, Danny.  Patrice thinks you saw Anthony Scott.  I mean, I know he does the cop.  I like having fun, too, beforehand.  He's not wearing anything under that desk.  I like going out and having a good time and, you know, talking and laughing.  And then, you know, of course, I would be thinking about fucking, yeah.  Of course, we all do.  What's too big?  Because Anthony is packing a fucking monster. 
[02:56:30]  No, it's not crazy like that.  Don't be silly.  Bigger than eight inches.  Yeah, that's...  See, that's pretty.  Never dated or had sex with a black guy is in the pre-interview.  Also, quote, not fond of them.  You're not fond of black guys?  There you go.  Well, I don't think that...  Oh, shit.  Now I am in love.  Like I said, I don't love you.  You have no idea.  You just hit a nerve with me, boy.  I love you.  You love me.  It hasn't been ruined by black helmets. 
[02:57:00]  Exactly.  You haven't been spoiled.  You're not doing shit.  We're just doing pre-interview on the bottom of page one.  Like I...  Like, okay, eight inches.  I can't take more than eight inches, so I don't know.  So she's...  A backhanded compliment.  But no, but she's...  She's...  This is...  That's the horse shit.  She's from Texas.  Come on.  No one says they're not fond of giant dicks, and that's why.  She doesn't like black guys.  Ask her why she don't like black guys.  Yeah, why don't you like black guys?  I didn't say I didn't.  It says they're not fond of them.  That doesn't...  I'll tell you.  I'll tell you.  Because every black guy she's met has been just a fucking prick trying to fuck her right 
[02:57:30]  off the bat.  Really?  And just like...  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, there you go.  Keep finished.  Yeah, yeah.  And just been an asshole.  Really?  Yeah.  Baby, let me tell you.  No, no.  Get the fuck out of here.  Because she doesn't meet those dudes.  Yeah, they come up to her.  They don't win on first class when she's flying around?  No, they come up to her like a fucking key club.  Yeah, but there black guys who...  I agree with him.  Like, a lot don't come up to me.  No.  No?  Yeah, black guys don't fucking...  She's a rape case. 
[02:58:00]  I'm a rape case.  She's a fucking...  She is a...  Somebody's going to jail.  If they fuck her nigga style on the top of the palms, it ain't going to fucking happen.  What's nigga style?  Exactly.  Just...  Yeah, what is it?  I mean...  It's the exact different style of that question.  Patrice, and the way you asked it...  Explain that, though.  What's the style all about?  I'm trying to be cool and play it off. 
[02:58:30]  Like, yeah, yeah, nigga style.  It's a rough...  I don't know.  It's the reason she don't fuck with black guys.  Where you're not sure if it's a rape or not.  It's because...  Okay, I agree.  It's because...  It's because...  It's three questions ago.  She's controlling...  It's...  She wants danger at her...  Her control.  Right.  She wants controlled danger.  She gets with a certain black guy that won't let her just tell her what to do.  Oh, shit.  Because all he really wants is white pussy, but white guys want her whole soul. 
[02:59:00]  They'll choke their wife in Cancun to be with her.  Black guys just want to smash it.  That's it.  Could you show her a booyah?  Would she be up for a booyah?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, just to see where she's at with black guys.  I'm telling you.  That's what...  It's just...  Black guys, she doesn't...  And, like I said, Texas.  She has a stigma.  There's a stigma.  Yes.  That, you know...  Do you still have a relationship, or do you still have both your parents?  And everything in your life?  They're around, yes.  Okay.  Okay.  And, uh...  Yeah.  That would be... 
[02:59:30]  Which is no...  That would be, you know, a black guy.  Texas.  But the fact that she said, they're around, means there's some issues there.  I would exploit.  It's just not...  Not like...  Are you not in touch with them?  Oh, yeah.  I talk to them all the time.  Yeah.  But it's not...  It's not how a young, white, Texas girl should have a relationship with a parent.  Well, they got divorced.  They got divorced when she was two years old.  She was supposed to be lead head cheerleader, not...  She probably was.  You know... 
[03:00:00]  Was she?  Yeah.  Cheerleader?  I was a cheerleader, but my...  Exactly.  I was not lead head...  I was a...  She disappointed them early.  What is the point of...  What is the point of legitimacy in this field?  Where...  Where...  As a comedian, I feel like you get trashed by your parents for a long time.  I've actually seen this before.  What?  Oh, you saw Booyah?  Well, I've seen something similar.  Yeah, this black guy is putting his balls...  Where's he putting his balls?  He's putting his balls in her ass, which, by the way, would hurt.  How do you put balls in her ass?  Exactly.  We're about to see. 
[03:00:30]  I don't even know.  It's buffering.  It's buffering because everyone else has to see Booyah right now.  Now he shoves them in there.  That's gotta hurt.  Look, he shoves the two balls in her ass.  I'm gonna hurt him.  She's gaping pretty good there.  And that's what I was gonna say.  Who's worse?  Ha ha ha ha!  The guy?  Him or her?  Let's be honest.  Or her.  All right.  Squeezing his balls in her ass.  That, um...  I bet that's right up on the mantle next to her prom picture.  I bet it is.  Your old dad is looking at that before it puts a shotgun in his mouth.  It's her patience.  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Very patience.  Wait, is that her?  Yeah.  That's television.  No, that's not her.  No, it's not.  What?  Oh, my God.  I got confused.  Don't...  Jesus Christ.  All right.  My image.  That's right, bitch.  Ah, fucking buffering.  That should be in the Guinness World Book of Records.  I apologize for the shotty call.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You gotta apologize.  Freak that bitch out, man, Tom.  Freak that bitch out, Tom.  What is it?  Freak that bitch out?  Yeah, freak that bitch out, Tom.  I think he did. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, he's got balls.  She can say she has balls in her ass, though.  Nugget.  Nugget.  Nugget.  Nugget.  Nugget.  You guys are just going,  Nugget.  Nugget.  I don't know what's going on there.  But Taylor, what is it?  Is this the style you're talking about there, Patrice?  Right.  This is what black guys want to do to Taylor.  Oh, my God.  On the top of the palms?  If you got a piece of her,  you would just...  You would always be walking around  with some kind of music  that sounded like angels.  Yeah.  And, you know, everything... 
[03:02:00]  But there's some black guy,  if they got a piece of Taylor,  would try to stick his balls in the ass off.  I'm using nasty, girl.  I ain't trying.  Using nasty, girl.  I ain't trying.  All right.  He's going to town.  He's got his balls up her ass.  He's got his dick in her...  We're close.  It's the first time I've ever seen that.  We're close to the booze.  And having no dick side.  Wait, wait, here.  At home.  Yeah.  I didn't do this at home, man.  Here it comes.  I just saw him on first 48.  Oh, see. 
[03:02:30]  This is what they picked him up for, actually.  Keep in my nuts.  I don't even want to let my nuts out.  Come on.  With the buffers.  I hate this clip.  Sucks.  Come on there, Taylor.  Bear with us.  It's worth it, man.  Fuck yeah.  Fuck you, bitch.  You don't want me to let my nuts out.  There's only so much clip on us.  I like the romantic talk.  Get Taylor some water.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  I don't want to let my nuts out.  Now you got it.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  You getting BP.  Thank you. 
[03:03:00]  Nice.  Oh, come on.  This stupid fucking video is taking forever.  This could be the last one.  You got to do it with me.  I'm thinking of that asshole.  I don't even want to let my nuts out.  Yeah.  No.  No booyah.  Oh, no.  Isn't it even a booyah clip?  Jesus Christ.  They don't even do the booyah, Taylor.  I'm sorry.  I'll have to watch it when I get home.  Anthony, she's not into anal.  Or hardcore fetish.  Or golden showers.  All right.  Whatever.  This is slowly disintegrating.  Nothing too weird.  Nothing too weird with Taylor Vickson. 
[03:03:30]  Just trying to find out what she's all about.  Are you in a relationship?  Or were you?  No, I'm not.  Yeah.  What's the problem?  What happened?  Just work.  What happened?  Too much work?  What's the problem?  I just don't have a relationship right now.  So it says if you want to bang a guy, she'll decide within the first few minutes, and it  won't be based on career or status.  So if you go to, like, Chipotle, for example.  Chipotle?  Yeah.  Chipotle.  I don't know how it is.  Chipotle.  Chipotle? 
[03:04:00]  Chipotle.  Okay.  Chipotle.  So let's say you're at a Mexican fast food restaurant, and are you, do you have any interest  in the guy serving you the food, or is it, is that?  I think it's always like, it doesn't matter who, it's always that, I like that, if I want  to fuck them, I can tell by just looking at them, like, hey, I want to fuck you.  Would you?  No.  Fuck.  That's for you to find out.  That means no.  That means no. 
[03:04:30]  That means no.  It's been a long time.  That means no, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Get out.  Get out.  So keep this blind date going on, what's she already saying.  Yeah.  Want another drink?  Dessert?  Yeah.  Well, it's getting a little late.  I got to work tomorrow.  Fucking 52-year-old with blue balls.  Fuck that with blue balls.  I'll jerk off under the table on her shoe.  You know what I'm saying?  And she'll be like, what are you doing now?  And she'll just be here in the bottom of the fucking table at Plataforma. 
[03:05:00]  So do you eat meat?  No, I don't really like, but I love meat.  Good girl.  I'm Texas.  Good girl.  Yeah, that's good.  Barbecue.  So you've kind of made it, you know, you're a penthouse person, but what's the, like, open  mic equivalent of this kind of modeling?  Like, in a garage somewhere, like, in a basement, sort of, what is the entry level position of  what you do?  I wouldn't know the entry level, because I started out. 
[03:05:30]  You just went straight into the same time.  It's reverse.  They start at the top and then fall.  Oh.  Because, you know, she sees, they see her, she looks good.  It's like, oh, she's young, she's new, she's the boom, bap, and that's what it is.  Because then, in three years, four years, it's basically, you start at the top.  Yeah, you don't start, there's no bottom.  But what's going to happen to Taylor Vixen as the years go by?  When she gets 35, she'll be still trying to limp around and, you know, take advantage 
[03:06:00]  of it, you know?  I will probably shoot for just a couple, two more years or three, and then I'm going to  turn over and work in the business.  I have ideas.  I've never had a dollar for all the times I heard that over the years.  I mean, good luck to you, but Lainey will tell you.  You know what?  I agree with you.  Sunset Thomas said that, and she fucking got her 50-year-old ass in here recently and  showed off her pooter.  I'm not saying, have you talked to Lainey about your future and where it's headed?  She knows.  Oh, yeah.  There is no, there's two things.  There's no Hall of Fame for bitches who strip.  And there's no Dosagis beer woman. 
[03:06:30]  There's no most interesting woman in the world.  Like, once you're old.  But here's what I agree with you.  Listen, I have a lifeline.  I do.  I know that.  Really?  Yes.  Good girl.  There's a lifeline in this.  What's a lifeline?  But has Lainey told you?  You know, your career can go.  Yeah.  There's a lifeline and then it's...  It's like a football player.  Has Lainey told you that every four years, she changes her number?  That's kind of where she lives. 
[03:07:00]  Don't worry.  And you'll be calling her for help.  I'll find her.  Like Roller Girl from Boogie Nights.  And you'll just be living with Burt Reynolds and Marky Mark in a big house with Don Cheadle  selling you stereos.  All right, listen, we got Dan in Ohio.  Dan, we got Taylor Vixen, the Penthouse Pet of the Year in studio.  Yay, Ohio.  Yeah, hello.  Hi.  Hi.  How you doing?  No, I just want to say, and it's kind of complicated to say, but she's... 
[03:07:30]  This girl has been pre-programmed since probably like high school to make guys think they can  fuck her and think that there's an actual real chance of that, but in reality, there's  no possible way that any normal average Joe is fucking her.  Wow.  It's the same ideology behind strippers, behind anyone that works in an industry where the  main thing is to make someone think you're going to fuck them.  Yeah, but that's, we know that, and that's redundant, and also, they know that, and at 
[03:08:00]  the end of the day, that's why a lot of strippers and girls like this get involved with normal  guys to prove that they're not the pieces of shit that everybody thinks they are.  Do you really see her getting with a normal guy?  She's probably been with normal guys.  Oh, yeah.  Who is she?  She would not date a guy, because again, she's controlling.  So a guy that thinks, that fucks girls like her, and thinks they can fuck girls like her,  she wants nothing to do with. 
[03:08:30]  She wants a guy who's pathetic.  But in a cool way, a guy that doesn't believe that, you know, he can really do what she's  afraid that guys will do to it.  Like E-Rock.  Oh, wow.  E-Rock would be, I don't know.  I can't believe that.  I really have a chance to go to a strip club and pick it up, a real stripper, like, and  taking her home.  An average guy?  An average guy could pick up a stripper, because she has all sorts of issues.  No, it's not really.  Not an average guy in a strip club, because they hate him. 
[03:09:00]  You need a lot of money.  They hate him.  Anthony's approach is the best approach to fucking her.  Yes.  And it's probably a month to two month long commitment of not fucking.  I think it's about five days.  It's a journey.  I can't wait for two months.  Fair enough.  That's even better.  Wait, so you'll fuck Anthony next Wednesday?  Next Wednesday.  We'll make an appointment.  I'm here, too.  So, perfect.  See you next Wednesday.  Come on.  Yeah, there we go.  Now, I don't believe it. 
[03:09:30]  Not because it's you, Anthony.  I just don't believe him.  Yeah.  But at the end of the day, I think if you can, because there is a technique to pretend  not to want to fuck, and still want to fuck, and they know that technique, too.  But there's a technique that almost makes them question if you're gay or not.  Like, you've gone past.  You've gone past the sexual.  You've gone past the bullshit.  Where it's just.  Yeah.  Just about the sex part.  Right.  And that's why she probably pops older dudes, just because she believes older dudes,  they have some knowledge to give her. 
[03:10:00]  I mean.  I like her.  I mean, she's doing what she's doing, but she got four more years for the expiration date  because 30 is it.  What are you going to do?  You can't be doing these things at 30.  Tell her.  What are you going to do at 30?  At 30?  Yeah.  What do you think you're going to be doing?  Yeah.  Oh, I think I'm going to be doing.  I know what I'm going to be doing.  I'll be working in the business, probably, but not shooting anymore.  Doing what?  I have ideas.  Lainey's here.  Lainey got her spot.  What's the other parts of the business besides what you do? 
[03:10:30]  You'll see them four years.  Typing the words in the forum?  Yes.  See, this is where she, if I wasn't a nigger, she'd be turned on because if I just continue  to needle her and the anger, see that shit?  She don't even know.  As you're needling and needling and they just get emotional.  See, you are the opposite end of the spectrum from me.  Yes.  You're the opposite end of the spectrum from me and my approach. 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  Absolutely.  We catch animals differently.  Yes, exactly.  He catches them by hitting them on the head so they don't know what's going on.  I'm a bear hunter.  I set a trap.  Yes.  No, you don't set a trap.  No, you lunge out of the woods and bite their throat.  Yes.  I will set an elaborate trap mechanism.  No, you won't.  You are even worse.  What do I do?  You feed them things out of your hand.  Oh, my God.  And then stab them in the back of your neck.  You can't take that.  That sounds accurate. 
[03:11:30]  And then stab them.  You gain their confidence, then you poke them in the neck with a buoy knife.  I come out immediately aggressive.  You're a caveman.  I'm a caveman.  You're a caveman.  Oh, it's not funny.  I just learned how to use tools.  Oh, he fucking is good.  It's a little grain.  That's the German from Saving Private Ryan when he runs into Oppen in the staircase.  Slowly putting the knife in.  That's it.  So, Taylor, how did you get discovered? 
[03:12:00]  I see that someone said nice boobs.  Next thing you know, you're taking your clothes off.  Wow.  I actually was watching a show, and I saw Erica Ellison on it, which was the 2008 Penthouse  Pet of the Year.  And honestly, I was like, oh, I want to do what she's doing.  So I started looking up photographers she shot with, sent my stuff in, flew to L.A., shot,  and then all of a sudden, it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Wow.  You got natural boobs?  Yes.  Yeah, those are natural, buddy.  Those look good.  Shit.  She seemed actually pretty nice.  Oh, now you're going to be nice. 
[03:12:30]  Thank you.  You don't know me that well, nigga.  I disagree.  I was being nice.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  I disagree with you.  You don't know me.  Well, I tell you what.  I got the head going.  I don't know you now.  That's right.  I disagree with Patrice.  I think she seems really smart.  I think she's going to have a career after this.  She seems what?  She seems pretty smart.  Well, tell her, motherfucker.  Don't talk to me, man.  I disagree with you.  I'm looking at this, for example, and it says her favorite movie ever is Idiocracy.  That is my favorite movie. 
[03:13:00]  No one made that up.  No publicist made that up.  You know why that's my favorite movie?  This is why I hate the fact that people think I'm an asshole.  This is my favorite movie because it shows you it's a stupid movie.  Have you seen it?  I love it.  I love that movie.  You watch it, and then you go, oh, my God.  This is what the earth has turned into.  See, now you're hurting your case because you're describing it.  But I agree with Namki.  Well, she's just proving that she saw it.  Wait, wait, wait.  But I just feel that this is it.  Wait a minute.  Let me ask you a question, Taylor.  Did you know he was being a douche since you came in here? 
[03:13:30]  No, I'm being nice.  Since you came in here, he's being nice.  He has been here.  So it's serious.  I am serious.  That should be her favorite movie.  So it says here.  It says here.  What kind of pre-interview?  They have two pages.  Wait, why do you like that movie?  Because people are stupid?  Because it shows you, like, in 50 years, how dumb the earth turns from the way, you know,  because everybody is kind of dumb.  I don't remember.  I haven't seen it in a while.  I'm not sure. 
[03:14:00]  Well, 50 or 500 is a big difference.  I think, I actually think she will, she will have a job.  She'll, she could theoretically, and I don't know this woman.  Lainey, question for Lainey.  But she could knock off this woman's job.  What is, what is the other jobs to have?  Be honest, Lainey.  Besides, besides.  Well, she's not having my job.  Besides.  I think she's knocking off Lainey.  That's all I do.  Besides fucking twat related.  Yeah.  What, what is the other stuff she can do?  She can, a lot of the girls start their own, um, companies, their own websites, or their 
[03:14:30]  own, uh, production companies.  Based on what?  Based on that they start recruiting other girls.  Like, they go from being pimped out to being pimped, basically.  Being pimped.  Oh, they turn into pimps.  Yeah, they turn into pimps, basically.  That's fucking sexy.  Yeah.  Taylor, I like that.  I like that so you're chill.  Well, that's exactly a lot of what I'm doing.  I have, like, uh, three sites I'm doing up in the next, like, year and a half after I'm  done, you know?  Mm-hmm.  But that's just something in the works.  Like, I, you know, right now I'm focused on what I'm doing now, and I'll move on to  the next. 
[03:15:00]  I'm looking at you, too, and you're, a lot of your, um, attractiveness.  Features.  Not attractiveness.  Features.  You look beautifully, you look gettable.  You have a very, um, your thing is.  The girl next door is on her.  Yes, very girl next door.  Really?  Yes.  Yeah, she has.  Those tits, really?  No, no, no.  The girl next door has tits like dough.  I can see her.  It's not fantasy.  It's a fantasy girl.  She's gorgeous.  She's gorgeous, but it's not annoyingly, like, she's not annoyingly gorgeous.  She's, she's, like, regular gorgeous. 
[03:15:30]  It doesn't feel like porcelain or something.  Yeah, she's, she's regular gorgeous.  I like fake.  Right.  That's, that's her fake.  That's her appeal.  I know.  Yeah, no fake.  Yeah, yeah.  Those, like, bleach blonde comes in, and, you know, big fake tits, and it's just, it  looks fake.  Now, how do you like your pussy to smell, Anthony?  Hmm?  I like.  That looks so random.  Such a, I like, but I mean, I like.  That's a very good question.  I like a very pussy smell, like an ocean-y kind of.  I like to know that it's, uh, very clean, but I like to know where I am. 
[03:16:00]  Clean, but pussy.  I like to know where I am.  Right.  Clean, clean, clean.  Yeah.  A clean pussy smell, right?  Clean.  I like that.  And, uh, and, uh, but, but, you know, you don't want, like, cotton candy.  Right.  That's weird.  It's out of place.  Because that's like chewing bubblegum.  Right.  Something's going on.  Right.  But it's like bubblegum flavor at the dentist.  You don't want, like, you know, it's, you know that it's not bubblegum.  There's something going on.  But you don't want anything bad, either.  Like, uh-oh, something's a little off.  Do you want a little gamey?  Not gamey.  Gamey's a weird word. 
[03:16:30]  Gamey's a hard word.  Yeah, gamey's a bad word.  That's a terrible word.  To describe a vagina.  Gamey's never fun.  Do you like a guy being able to, you know, go down on you with a little talent?  Yes.  That's good, yeah.  Yes.  Do you like the entire undercarriage being taken care of?  Yes.  Oh, you like your asshole lick.  Really?  Yeah, but mine's not hairy, so I don't know if you'd like it.  You don't have to always throw a fucking rejection deflection.  Hey, she has a beautiful way to reject.  Is that a...  Do you understand? 
[03:17:00]  Just for you.  There's a fucking...  A rejection deflection, by the way.  Nice.  It's a small poem.  Immediately, she's like, yeah, but am I...  Like, okay.  Like, I'll lick the fucking fat bitch security guard's asshole downstairs.  It don't...  Like, you don't have to do that all the time.  That technique, I caught your technique.  You keep turning people down, but it's beautiful.  Yeah.  That's for you to find out. 
[03:17:30]  Just go with it.  Maybe you like your asshole lick.  Yes, I do.  I mean, like, I'm gonna fucking try to lick it right now.  I'm just fucking...  Well, it's not out of the question.  Well, yeah, no, no, no.  You know?  Well, it says you want to meet sort of a regular guy.  When you meet a regular guy, are you gonna say, I'm Taylor Vixen, or are you gonna say, I'm Sarah Wilson, or whatever your real name is?  No, she's not on the microphone anymore.  She's taking...  I'm sorry.  I hope he's doing a photo shoot over there.  Well, why not? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Nice teeth, everything, man.  Yeah.  And what are you, a 32 double?  Yeah, what are you doing?  There's a mixture of everything.  I got big boobs.  Can we see them?  Like, double Ds.  Yes.  32 double D?  Corn fed.  I actually have a...  Did I hear a yes?  Yeah, and I actually have a talent I'm gonna do with them.  Oh, okay.  I figured something out.

This is the definition of lynching.  Oh, man.  I'll die with a nice smile on my face.  Oh, no.  I don't know if I can like it.  I'm not sure.  You can do anything you want.

[03:24:00]  Oh my god damn it.  Fucking asshole.  The most awful titties ever.  Are you stopping?  No, your girl is an exception to the rule.  The rule basically is the black girl's titties kind of sag a little lower than white girl's.  They're the same titties.  No, no.  They're meaty.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  But wait a minute.  Here's the thing.  Those are very, those are nice.  No offense.  The nipples are sitting in a great spot.  They are hangy.  They're heavy.  But they're not hanging.  Right.

Yeah, a little cellulite.  I saw something that made you more real.  No, not that.  What?  Had a little pimple on the booty.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, a little pimple on the booty.  Oh, man.

[03:27:30]  I like it.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah, yeah.  Look at that.  I see it.  Look at that.  That makes my self-esteem higher.  It makes me more real.  Yeah.  Can we pop that pimple for you?  Jesus Christ.  Wait, where'd you go?  Let me ask you a question.  Would you pop that pimple for her?  Um, no.  No?  Let me ask you.  The actual anus is off limits.  That's where it kind of gets dicey.  I do fingers.  No, no, no.  I mean a view of the anus. 
[03:28:00]  A view of the booty hole.  A view?  Because can I be honest with you?  Yeah.  For a seasoned creep, pussy, a front shot of a vagina doesn't even count.  And I'm going to tell you, the lips don't even count.  Where it gets dirty and you get real and you get like, she's a trooper, is asshole  and the entire system.  The whole undercarriage, right, right.  Yeah, the entire system.  You go, wow, she's a fucking trooper.  So I don't know if that's off limits for you, but that is where I was looking for.  I was getting...  Oh, off limits to like... 
[03:28:30]  To look at.  You can see it in the magazines, though.  Let me...  Where's the magazine at?  Yeah, but that's the anti-pimple one.  I want to see...  Anti-pimple.  I want to see the fucking...  The little bump, nigga.  Is this her here?  We could draw one on for you.  That was cute, baby.  That was fucking cute.  Let me see here.  What page, Lainey?  Oh, here's one.  Oh, you're getting warm?  Okay.  It's because of you.  Oh, there we go.  Do you do like girl-on-girl stuff? 
[03:29:00]  I do girl-on-girl, yes.  All right, Patrice is looking at the picture now.  Let's see.  Cute little...  She's kind of cover-y.  Cover-y?  I want to see an actual dirty little bunghole shot, but it's not...  No dirty...  No little dirty bunghole shot.  Hey, look in that magazine right there.  The forms right there.  Form, okay.  No bungholes with the little dirty...  There's actually a...  There's a girl-girl set in there.  You'll see.  Okay, which page?  A couple pages in.  I have like three pages.  You do girl-girl...  Oh, you've done girl-girl shots? 
[03:29:30]  I do girl-girl video.  Oh, yeah, video, too?  And then solo video.  Mm-hmm.  And solo video?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Did you see it?  Like where you look at the camera, like...  No, not hers.  Good spanking material?  It's all the fucking other girl.  Now, this other girl is on her way down.  Because Taylor, no bunghole shots.  Missed probably 32.  Spread that asshole, bitch, or we have nothing for you.  Why don't you...  Oh, wow.  So she's not at the...  You gotta show your bunghole.  She's on the way.  Taylor's...  She hasn't had to show asshole yet. 
[03:30:00]  I've showed...  No, if you Google it, but...  Yeah.  Come on, Taylor.  See?  You're just all about it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're right.  That doesn't have any...  Look, this other one, asshole, open, spread out.  You, you...  She's not shy.  This one here, asshole.  Patrice.  Open asshole.  Yeah, yeah.  Patrice, how many years is she away from opening asshole shots?  Oh, good five good years.  Yeah.  But maybe, like, because, lookit, I'm gonna tell you...  I'm gonna tell you something, Opie.  Yes. 
[03:30:30]  She comes in the game.  Uh-huh.  She's not pathetic, because she's 26, first of all.  No, that's not a good one.  And 26 is fucking old.  She's in the game at 26.  She might have longer.  She might fucking have about five years.  And then, she might not be showing asshole till she's 40.  Hey.  What if she pulls a hammy or something?  Oh, okay.  Patrice.  If she tears her ACL?  Yeah, if she tears an ACL or something.  Yeah, that could be a career.  That could shorten the career.  No, that would just bump her down to Hustler. 
[03:31:00]  And there's no senior tour for these broads.  She would be demoted to Hustler.  No, there's...  But if she wants to stay penthouse...  Right.  That's true.  There is a senior league called Over 40.  She has a...  Wait, that's you spreading your...  Yeah, she...  You got a little dirt in that asshole.  Yeah, she got...  A little bit.  She got a funky little asshole.  That's what it is.  Wait, she got a little dirt in there.  Is it?  Yeah, her asshole is not white man perfection.  I'm telling you.  She got black shit going on.  She got...  She has a couple of little assholes...  Thank God we can zoom in.  Yeah.  There's a little dirt in there. 
[03:31:30]  Jesus Christ.  A little baby knuckle coming out.  She hasn't had that surgery yet.  That's what it is.  A little something happening.  And there's a little daughter, some that's it right there.  She might have had some Mexican food, though.  We don't know.  No, no, no.  What's going on there?  That's a...  I don't want to get too clinical,  but that is what we call an asshole lover business.  A little hemorrhoid.  A little hemorrhoid.  You got the star of a little roid there.  A little roid.  A little bit.  Because she's from Texas.  She lifts things.  She's got to push out all that...  She's got to push out all that beef. 
[03:32:00]  She's got to fucking...  She's got to pull bulls.  She's got to bail hay.  She's got to shit out a bunch of T-bones in the morning.  She's sitting right there.  I fucked up the asshole a little bit.  Well, she's from Texas.  She eats a lot of beef.  She's pushing out some fucking steak.  Here's where it gets fucked up.  Yeah.  Black man's compliment is a white man's insult.  Now, if I say, man, she got a nice little soft tummy,  little reality asshole here.  For a black guy, she's becoming hotter and hotter. 
[03:32:30]  These super fake bitches do nothing.  She's not super skinny.  She's fucking...  That's why I do well, because I'm real.  Yeah.  Fucking big, big, healthy girl.  She's healthy, man.  I got it.  I got it.  And that's why she don't show the asshole yet.  There you go.  There you go.  In about seven years, we'll be...  Is that it there?  See, that's...  Yeah.  See, that's...  Patrice's like, see, that's...  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:33:00]  See?  Yeah.  And no offense, but...  That is...  She has...  Yeah, see, that's...  See, look at that.  Look at that.  Yeah.  But that's a five-pointed star.  I mean, my face is all...  That's a very...  See, if that was a black woman...  If that was a black woman's asshole,  you'd go get your guns and go,  Oh!  Monkey ass!  Boom!  Bam!  Smash!  I just...  I like white girl.  What can I tell you?  You get a fucking... 
[03:33:30]  You get a grade fucking 10, young lady.  I get a 10 from you?  Yeah, absolutely.  Usually...  These are all pleasantries.  Yeah, that's good.  You're just a little confused.  Doesn't you?  These are pleasantries from Patrice.  I know it sounds arrogant, but it's just...  You see a lot of women naked.  Thank you.  By the way, but this is...  She's actually...  Tale of Vixen.  Yeah.  Tale of Vixen is...  She's one of the best I've ever seen, lady.  I think...  Thank you.  Absolutely.  You're an ass tease, though.  Because she's...  I'm an ass tease?  Yeah, because she doesn't like anal,  but she's really kind of showing it off a lot there. 
[03:34:00]  I like fingers.  I just haven't gotten there yet.  I'm kind of saving it, you know?  Ah.  I know.  Like, as in my...  Even in my personal life,  I just haven't gotten there.  Really?  Yeah?  But you've got a finger in it?  Oh, yeah.  A little digit.  I like a little finger when I'm on top.  A digit.  Oh.  A little finger.  That's nice.  See, when she said...  She was saying you could hold the ass,  and then one of those fingers kind of starts moving.  A little cowgirl, stick it in.  That's what happens.  Guys will do that.  Hey, I like doggy, too.  And a motherfucker tries to go knuckle deep,  and she goes, no.  No.  Guys will do that. 
[03:34:30]  She goes, you only can go first knuckle deep.  Whatever the first knuckle...  Not the full knuckle, but the tip.  The little one.  Where you only get a dirty cuticle.  A little philandia.  Cuticle knuckle.  You only get a dirty cuticle.  She only goes cuticle knuckle.  Like, what the fuck?  Was I doing some gardening?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  There they go.  I'm a big fan now.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you turned us around.  Absolutely.  We thought you were going to just be another broad  that comes in here and is full of themselves  and does nothing.  Well, thank you so much.  But you were really good, I'm thinking. 
[03:35:00]  I don't like your pruneness  and your insecurity about your asshole.  Oh, I never said I wasn't secure about it.  I love it.  It's normal.  It looks natural.  I like her.  See how she called it?  She's a smart girl.  I love it.  She called it normal.  That was my initial fucking thesis.  Now I have to go back.  She used the word normal  to describe the fact that it's a little too assholy.  You know, I give it this.  When I first started in the business,  I was like,  I don't look like any of these girls. 
[03:35:30]  You know what I mean?  I'm opposite end.  And it actually did me a good thing.  Yeah, see?  Because I am a pretty different...  And now you're the penthouse pet of the year.  Yes, I love penthouse.  What else can we do?  I love Lainey.  Anything else?  What else can we do with you?  Who wouldn't, right?  What?  Who wouldn't love Lainey?  She brings nice girls in here.  She does.  She's a cool chick herself.  Most of the girls are nice, Lainey.  Oh, she does.  I haven't forgotten.  Oh, I know.  I haven't forgotten.  That is a real nice, slippery-looking vagina. 
[03:36:00]  Is it true that you're appearing on the Oprah network, sir?  Nice and dirty.  The Oprah network?  No, we're just commenting on pictures.  Just sitting there going, yeah, that's good.  That's great.  Reconnaissance photos.  Yeah.  All right.  That's good.  I think...  Thank you.  Unless you want to do something else for us, we don't know what else to do.  We're shy.  What were we going to do with the flashlight?  What was that?  Well, that was if you had implants.  If you have implants.  It doesn't work, Steve, if she doesn't have implants. 
[03:36:30]  If you turn the lights off and put a flashlight under a girl's boob that has implants and turn  the lights out, the whole boob glows like a booba lantern.  Yeah.  Hey, Patrice, when should she give up the asshole in the business?  That's a good question.  She's saving the asshole, but when should she give it up?  You know...  Patrice is going to have a good answer for this.  That's good advice for you.  At the end of the day, here's the problem.  When did you start saying at the end of the day, by the way? 
[03:37:00]  I don't know.  I like...  I'm pretty sure I will not...  I will not give it up.  I never heard you say that one before.  You're not going to give it up.  Here's what I don't like.  Here's her problem.  She's not a problem, but here's what's going to make her asshole valuable.  Valuable?  She's not a hoe.  That's the thing.  Taylor's not a hoe.  If she was a hoe, it's not a big deal.  But Taylor don't give up asshole.  There's not even...  There's no past guy who goes, yeah, I fucked this straight in an asshole and came in her 
[03:37:30]  ear.  There's no story.  She don't have any of those stories coming out.  So, I would say when life starts getting really bad and she might have to do porn, maybe, or  she has to do filthy stripteases, that's asshole action.  She'll get more money because she can announce never before seen inside a Taylor's asshole.  Bam!  Well, it's got to happen in her personal life first.  True.  That's not her, is it?  You know, that was the first...  And that's like... 
[03:38:00]  That's you?  That was...  As a blonde?  I did something blonde one time and that was the first thing I ever did right there.  You're watching like the first thing I ever did.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  I was blonde and I switched my hair back to normal.  I didn't like it.  You didn't like the blonde hair?  No, I think the brown looks better.  I was too busy watching the finger pop.  Rubbing your ass a little bit.  Yeah, I like the brown hair.  Where was this?  In LA?  That was in Miami.  Miami?  Yeah, that's where Reality Kings...  That's bang-busting them motherfuckers.  No, bang-busting... 
[03:38:30]  You fucking...  You saved her, lady.  She was on the way to sucking dick in the back of a van.  She was heading down the wrong path.  Dude, Reality Kings is the fucking...  I don't know.  Yeah, I did.  No, Reality Kings, they shot me for solo.  Whatever.  What's Reality Kings?  Reality Kings are...  They do hardcore.  They're the...  I'm trying to give up...  This girl wants to do hardcore.  It's the...  It's the minor leagues before porn. 
[03:39:00]  When you start Reality Kings, you move on to Bang Bus and you move on to all of that shit.  She was on the way to being a dirty, dirty girl.  And Lainey saved her.  You bitch.  And made her a classy little filth bag.  Oh, so she's gonna be a dirty girl.  She's just taking a few times.  But Lainey saved her from being finished at 26.  We'll go with that story.  She's starting at 26.  Now she'll be finished at 36 and then she'll go and do Bang Bus between 36 and 42.  Then she can go on and be a MILF. 
[03:39:30]  I would never do Bang Bus.  Oh, shut up.  You did Reality Kings, asshole.  How are you gonna say you're not gonna do Bang Bus?  You did Reality Kings.  Because I did solo with Reality Kings.  I don't know what that means.  That means it's just like a solo by myself.  I told him...  Yeah, it's not sucking dick in the back of a truck.  I don't do, big girl.  You're a fucking asshole.  Listen, Reality Kings have a lot of solo girls.  You're still trying?  You're still trying?  I'm always trying.  Holy shit.  I never commit.  I'm saying...  Reality Kings...  God bless you.  You got...  You were on the way and you know what? 
[03:40:00]  You got a good break.  You got a good break.  King House was a good break for you.  I love them.  Because Reality Kings was on the way because she says, I don't do boy and girl, but I've  seen Belladonna lesbian and you might as well do boy and girl.  It's more degrading.  Patrice, are you saying that she got out of the water just before the sharks grabbed her?  Dude.  Dude.  She has no idea.  She was in Miami sticking fingers in her pussy.  Two weeks later.  Day one.  Two weeks later.  Yeah.  She would have been pretending to get into a van for money. 
[03:40:30]  No, I wouldn't.  Suck a dick.  And then they throw her out and drive away without paying her.  She was a day away from that.  I've seen Bang Boss.  It's all right.  Two weeks later.  I'm saying I would all do love.  She was swimming around and had no idea the sharks were ready to grab her.  Dude, she fucking Lainey.  Oh my God.  Lainey, we bow to you today.  Lainey, you fucking saved somebody.  He gave her some class.  Yes.  Lainey's going to heaven now, man. 
[03:41:00]  Absolutely.  Lainey saved a life.  Lainey saved a life.  A little charity action for Lainey.  As beautiful.  As much as I love Belladonna, who I think is maybe in the top five greatest porn stars ever  lived.  Top five.  Because she's a whore.  And I don't mean she sells, but she's just unbelievable.  She's very much like Vanessa Del Rio, but she looks different.  She's just a great porn star.  She's an amazing person, too.  Oh, she's just great.  But she would never be on the cover of anything classy. 
[03:41:30]  No, no.  So that's what I'm saying.  She got saved.  This finger-popping scene, she's so lucky.  But that's what I do anyways.  I do solos.  I do solos for Penthouse.  I do solos.  I do girls.  Yeah, but you're classy.  But see, solos for Penthouse is different from solo for Reality Kings.  Is that fair enough?  I totally agree with you, yes.  That's fair.  That's it.  I agree.  Get her to do a solo for it.  Because it's more amateur, yes.  Patrice.  Yes.  Look, you can't press her to do that.  The thing is, she controls this, man. 
[03:42:00]  Ask nicely.  I'm not going to ask.  That's her job.  Look, Mike, would you like to ask you to do what you can handle this?  Mike, ask her nicely.  I'm not going to do it.  Let Mike Perbiglia.  If there's anything I would do in this situation, I would show her where the door is so that she  could escape from the situation.  Is that it?  That's all that I can do.  Why?  Is it getting creepy in here?  No, I don't know.  No, no.  Here's Mike's problem that just caught.  Are you recently married, Mike?  Or you've been married?  I got married about a year and a half ago. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, this is recent kind of thing.  I haven't seen Mike since he's been married.  She hasn't married.  Mike is not dealing with this.  Mike is not.  He has not effectively let his woman know that he's a piece of garbage.  A piece of shit, right.  And that he involves himself.  Mike and Mrs. Perbiglia?  No, no.  She didn't take my name.  She didn't take your name?  No.  Wow.  You married a bitch and didn't make her take your fucking name?  She must have a good name and didn't like Perbiglia.  It doesn't bother me.  I'm not even giving the bitch a hyphen.  She don't get to nothing. 
[03:43:00]  She loses her identity if I fucking lose my freedom.  Are you fucking serious?  Yeah, I'm serious.  It doesn't bother me.  Her identity.  It doesn't bother me.  God damn, Patrice.  Mike, that bothers me, man.  Yeah?  Yeah, you fucking...  You're going to give her...  Here's what you're going to do.  That hurts Patrice's soul.  You're going to stop having fun with this woman who is going to eventually give us a little  finger shot.  Yeah, sure.  And you have to pretend to want to read about Tiger Woods just to stay away from the fucking  evil?  That's what that fucking woman did to you, but she doesn't have your fucking last name? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, I don't take a lot of stock in that.  Yeah, you better tell her to get your fucking last name.  All right, all right.  I'll tell her that you said that.  For real, man.  That's the whole fucking point of that.  Because he done canceled all his madness.  He's not even enjoying fucking penthouse fingers in the booty.  He starts harrumphing with the fucking daily news to escape this evil shit. 
[03:44:00]  Don't forget the star of the hemorrhoid, too, man.  Come on, man.  Get her to get your fucking...  Make a deal with it.  She keeps the slash or whatever, man.  You don't fucking marry a woman, she don't take your last name.  All right.  For fucking real, man.  And my girl, she's her last name, Brown.  That bitch ain't keeping Brown.  You might as well flush that down the toilet, motherfucker.  You are O'Neal.  O'Neal now.  You don't have an identity if I can't have fun no more.  Hey, Dan, she's got a lot of stuff on freeones.com, too. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, you found some shit?  Jesus.  That was the stuff we were playing.  Okay.  I fucking like...  I'm not going to lie to you.  I've never said this.  Never.  She is absolutely my favorite.  One of these...  The playmate.  There was one who was a trooper, though.  You brought in.  She was a complete...  He slapped her.  Yeah, slapping her in the ass.  Oh, right, right, right.  Yep.  Tay Parker.  Oh, she was the one that was on VH1.  Yeah, Tay Parker.  She was a trooper, but I like her better. 
[03:45:00]  Whatever happened to her?  She old.  She's old.  She never had the Bret Michaels thing.  She did Bret Michaels thing, and then now it's like...  And then had the fake relationship for two weeks.  Yeah.  And then the media went away, and then she went back to her life.  Yeah, and she was old.  And now I guarantee you there's a lot more her showing her asshole than it was three years ago.  She's gaping at this point.  Oh, my God.  Who's that?  That's Taylor?  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  There's nothing you can do with that age, man.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, you got to get it all in in the next few years, Taylor.  Yeah, there's nothing you can do with it. 
[03:45:30]  Learn from the women that came before you.  Get it all in, man.  Yeah, yeah.  Get it all in.  I'm telling you, but you got a good attitude.  I like her a lot.  Thank you so much.  I wish her well.  Sometimes you go, yeah, really?  You want to catch?  I like to see her.  Usually you want to catch a woman when she's 35 to say, look at you now.  That's why I want to be a vampire so bad.  I just want to be alive when bitches get old.  Bitch is like 50.  Like, what happened to you?  Blah.  Look at you now, bitch.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Blah.  Now you're showing your asshole now, huh? 
[03:46:00]  Blah.  But she, I like to see her and hope that she did her thing and was smart about it.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Are you banking your money?  Yep.  Am I what?  Banking your money.  Oh, yeah.  Saving for a rainy day, you know?  I'm saving every dime.  Yeah, that's good.  For my businesses later.  I'm just saving.  But what is your money fetish?  Like, what do you buy for yourself that you just love buying?  You know what's funny is I'm a very plain, simple girl.  I don't like a lot of things. 
[03:46:30]  What do you spoil yourself with?  You spoil yourself with something.  Food?  I love pedicures and I love going out to eat.  I love sushi.  I love Brazilian food.  Now, do you treat yourself to nice restaurants?  Like, fucking A-list restaurants?  Fogo de Chau is my favorite restaurant.  Patrice likes Brazilian restaurants.  Fucking Brazilian.  This bitch loves Brazilian.  Wait.  Did you take her to Plataforma yet?  No, not yet.  Wait.  Isn't there a Brazilian steakhouse?  Plataforma, man.  Is that the one with the paddle?  Yeah.  You know, I don't think that any steakhouse can compare to Fogo, though.  So that's the problem. 
[03:47:00]  It's a real love connection.  Because, you know, Patrice loves Brazilian food as well.  I love Brazilian everything.  I love a lot of Brazilian stuff in my mouth.  Except Brazilian nuts.  Except Brazilian.  Fogo de Chau.  Sorry, sorry.  On, um.  Cheap shot.  Cheap shot.  On La Brea.  Not La Brea.  On La Cienega.  Yep.  You're right.  On La Cienega.  They're very good.  Get in there.  Plataforma's better.  No, no, no.  Really?  Plataforma.  Plataforma's better.  I'll let them wear her out.  They're Fogo de Chau, I think. 
[03:47:30]  Have you taken them?  Are you doing the rope-a-dope?  Anthony.  I will try it.  Anthony, take it up.  I'll wear it like a jackal off.  I can just drag her.  Anthony, take it up to Plataforma, man.  Could Anthony take you out for a little food?  Plataforma.  No, no.  We don't do, like, fake radio.  Wait, wait.  What are you doing?  If you say absolutely, that means, yeah.  They're on 48th.  You're here until Wednesday?  I'm here until, uh.  Well, I work Wednesday.  But, yeah, I'm here until Wednesday.  I'm here until Thursday.  What if you take her out for Brazilian and then Patrice comes in in the middle of the meal? 
[03:48:00]  Perfect.  I'm not doing anything.  You want to go to dinner Tuesday?  Plataforma.  Absolutely.  All right.  It's on 48th between.  Wait, when are you going out to dinner?  8th and 9th.  Tuesday?  Closer to 8th.  Wait, are you lying, Taylor?  What am I lying about?  Why was she lying?  She just gave Lainey a wink.  Help, Lainey!  No.  Go.  You can't do this.  She knows the look of the help.  Wait, but you can't do this just for the radio.  We're really serious.  Ant's a great guy.  You should at least just have a little meal with him.  I hope he should now.  What I'm going to do right now is not saying a word. 
[03:48:30]  Watch what I do for you, Ant.  Oh, look at that.  What?  For all the people who think that we don't get along, watch what I do.  You're shutting your own mic off.  I'm out!  I'm out!  I'm out!  I'm out because I know I'll just ruin it.  Lainey, for real, to make it for real, though, why don't you set up Plataforma and they  come on, you know, you can be the whatever.  Sounds great.  I'm not doing anything.  Talk some shit.  You know, it's not going to be good.  And then we talk without all this bullshit around.  That's such a good line.  Don't have to sit there talking about finger popping.  We're not going to set these up at the table? 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, we'll set up microphones.  At the table?  And, uh, yeah.  I have one more thing to say.  Hold on, hold on.  I have one more thing.  No, no, no.  No, just shut up.  You can't shut up.  Damn it!  All right.  I'll, uh, what I'll do is...  Have her put a number in your phone with a titty, motherfucker.  Stop playing around.  Use your titty.  The titty number.  Put your number in...  Next time I got asked for my number, I'm going to be like, hold on.  Give me your phone.  Oh, that is great.  I just have one more question. 
[03:49:30]  What are you going to do?  One more question.  What are you going to do?  Can I...  Damn it!  Don't you keep trying to turn that fucking thing off.  You turn that off because you're a cut blocker.  I was just trying to help you out.  I'm just...  Uh...  Okay, there you go.  See?  What, what, are you going to write it down or just remember it?  Jesus.  That's, that's my phone number.  And put, put something, put something in there I can call. 
[03:50:00]  Programming is your phone.  There you go.  Yeah.  iPhone?  Dude.  She's supposed...  Can I talk?  What, what, what, oh?  Can I talk?  What, go ahead.  You can talk.  She's supposed to just call your fucking phone now.  Yeah, so you know it's legit.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Like, she puts that in and then calls it.  Hold on.  And then I could text you.  I think dinner's better there than lunch.  Because dinner has, dinner has sushi and everything else.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dinner's much better.  And then you come in and talk about the date and we give you more, uh, more, like, publicity. 
[03:50:30]  It's just...  That's what we do.  It's just going out and having dinner and talking.  It'll be very nice.  That's nice.  First of all, could you...  Yes, Patrice?  Can I help you out?  Yeah, go ahead, Patrice.  Stop making a I'm-not-gonna-rape-and-murder-you-just-claiming.  Don't rape-and-murder-you-just-fuck, you're done.  Just go with it.  Like, stop, man.  Now you're like, we're just gonna...  Just fucking stop.  Accept the yes.  Accept the yes.  Yes.  Fake it.  Don't get angry.  Just accept the yes.  Fucking motherfucker. 
[03:51:00]  Get the hotel room just in case.  Well, I have to stay in town because I get up early.  Yeah, stay in town.  I know.  Kenny, hook that up.  Yeah, you know.  Thank you.  Anthony's regular penthouse suite.  Kenny's my Lainey.  Please.  Right, Ant?  See what I do?  How cool...  Penthouse suite.  How cool is this as a date?  Some average bum.  You just go, Lainey set it up.  Kenny set it up.  She's like, thank you, Lainey.  It's just an arranged...  It's just that way...  That way we can just concentrate on the fun part of it.  Not all the bullshit that goes along with it.  God, is that great.  Yeah.  Set it up, my friend. 
[03:51:30]  Fuck, we're running out of show.  Damn.  And it's about three minutes left to the whole show.  All right, what did we learn today?  That Taylor Vixen is a good egg.  Yes.  Thank you.  I called it early, by the way.  Yes, you did.  Thank you.  He did.  I attacked him, and I apologize because he did actually call that, and he meant it because  I caught it myself.  We only found two flaws, a pimple on the ass and the start of a hemorrhoid, but if you  change your diet, we can take care of that.  I don't know what was up with that picture, y'all.  Lookit, she's upset that there's a hemorrhoid picture of him out there. 
[03:52:00]  She's got someone's...  You know, buddy, they would not let me shoot with a hemorrhoid, I'm pretty sure.  Of course.  I'm sure they got a guy that just pushes that in before they shoot photos.  Someone, someone's head's going to roll over at Reality Kings.  This guy, his whole job is just to push that back in.  You know the guy that takes care of the set, so it's all...  What is it called?  Yeah, set dresser.  And she hates that shit, too. 
[03:52:30]  She's being a good egg about it, but she's really upset about that little booty diet.  I'm really not.  We have a continuity diet.  I think it's sexy baby.  A little baby knuckle that comes sneaking out of there.  All right, listen, we're running out of show for real.  We got Mike Birbiglia at Caroline's.  Unfortunately, he had to be very quiet to save his very early, very young marriage.  Pussy ass newlywed without her.  Man, don't let me hear your wife.  Don't have your last name next time I see you, Mike.  I'm very serious about that.  I'm confused. 
[03:53:00]  I want to get you on the phone with my wife.  Yeah, man, fuck all that keeping her fucking in debt bullshit, whatever she's trying to  keep.  We should have put her on the phone.  Fuck all that shit.  That would have been good.  That name thing is really got the truth.  Mikey, it's been a while, but a pleasure seeing you, sir.  Caroline's tonight and tomorrow, 212-757-4100, and Patrice O'Neal, who just fucking killed  today.  We love having Patrice on.  I'll see you guys.  I haven't seen you in a while.  Hey, can we be on your show?  I'll see if I can find a spot for you.  Steve, set that up.  I got to get a show. 
[03:53:30]  I'll see if I can fit you guys.  Oh, my God.  Why did I do that to myself?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you really...  Oh, I saw it in every fucking cell of your body.  Oh, my God.  The rejection was just...  Oh, my God.  Why do I bother?  Why the fuck do I bother?  Astounding.  Oh, that wasn't even a joke.  Fuck.  And tell a vixen.  What are we promoting?  Any appearances or anything?  Yes, we have the Cybrite Awards. 
[03:54:00]  It's on Saturday night.  I'm giving out some awards.  Also, I'm promoting my Penthouse Forms magazine that just came out.  You can pretty much find it on newsstands everywhere.  Great scene in here.  Great scene of her.  Pick up every Penthouse magazine.  I'm in them all the time.  Why don't you get some followers, man?  Taylor Vixen with an E on Twitter.  At taylorvixen.com.  I tweet boob pictures and ass shots all the time.  Damn.  That's my big thing.  I do ass shots like every other day.  Same.  And they're natural ones.  They're with my little camera on my Mac.  Let's try to get her to sell... 
[03:54:30]  That's fucking great.  ...her pussy.  I want...  When she gets a pussy, I want it to sell more than Jamie Lynn's.  We are coming out with that this summer, so more to look for.  What?  Your own pussy?  We're coming out with my boobs first and my feet.  Yeah.  Right on.  And hey, wait.  That's a whole other topic.  And here's a good idea.  Maybe for...  She should come out when they do the whole entire thing.  Yeah.  Two versions of the asshole.  Ghetto approved with the little bumps.  The little dirt.  And the white guy.  Just a little dirt.  Perfection one.  Just for you.  Little funky, little thingy happening. 
[03:55:00]  Fantastic.  Just a little bullshit.  A little, you know.  Can we...  I'm telling you.  Can we mold E-Rock's boobs if she's molding Taylor Vixen?  It's just a comparison.  Can you do it just for the show?  Can we...  He'll do it.  E-Rock will do it.  That'd be hilarious.  A fucking life-size fucking...  Did you say Mikey's at Caroline's this weekend?  Hell yeah, I did.  Very funny comic, man.  Go see Mikey if you're in the city.  Mike Birbiglia.  Nice.  I think we did it all, right?  We are out of time here.  Thank you so much for having me on. 
[03:55:30]  Taylor, we thought you'd be on for 10 minutes.  And I'll see you Tuesday.  Hell yeah.  Is that really going down?  Dude, stop.  Stop.  I'm not fucking around.  Take it.  Stop it.  He's not.  Just go.  I know.  No, he'll go, but I don't like this fake radio shit.  We're also...  I'm not believing that she's not, though.  All right, good.  I don't sense...  Patrice.  I don't sense fake.  I buy it.  It's my favorite place.  I'm still...  All right, Patrice.  If he's going to dinner with her on Tuesday, could you do the show with me Wednesday? 
[03:56:00]  Because he ain't coming in.  Why wouldn't I come in?  I'm staying in town.  I'll be...  I'll make it over here.  Yeah.  I'll be...  Do you know...  I'll be...  These niggas are fucking up.  All right, we'll all shut up.  All right, we'll all shut up.  Like, does she even know what that means?  We'll all shut up.  We'll just shut the fuck up.  Look, I'm turning everyone's mics off.  I have no idea.  The next sound you're going to hear is...  No, I don't...  Believe me.  Are we out?  I enjoy a cocktail or two.  Yes.  But I don't get obnoxious or drunken crazy. 
[03:56:30]  That's for sure.  That's not Anthony.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Guys, thanks.  Have a great weekend.  Later.  See you on Twitter over the weekend and on the radio on Monday, whatever.  All right. </pre>
