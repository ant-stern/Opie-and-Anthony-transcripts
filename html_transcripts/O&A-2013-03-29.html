<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about childhood toys, specifically Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, sparked by an Ozzy Osbourne Hot Wheels car.  The hosts reminisced about their childhoods, using vulgar language to describe their experiences with Hot Wheels tracks and storage, and debated the value of vintage cars, referencing *Pawn Stars*.  The conversation shifted to model trains, focusing on Eric's Harry Potter Hogwarts Express set and his general spending habits, prompting jokes about his wife's reaction.  A call with Troy Kwan further explored Eric's purchases and home renovations, including a planned hot tub.  The discussion then unexpectedly jumped to Amy Schumer's career, weight, and tabloid scrutiny, before circling back to memories of Toys R Us and KB Toys, professional wrestling toys, and the current state of *Saturday Night Live*.  Amy Schumer, who was a caller at this point, shared a personal anecdote about her current roommates, one of whom had recently undergone a double mastectomy.

The next segment featured Amy Schumer, Tom Green, and Jim Norton in studio.  The primary focus was Schumer's upcoming show, *Inside Amy*, and the humorous battles with network standards and practices over explicit content.  Several examples of these notes were read, focusing on objections to depictions of sex, specific words (including "dyke," "cunt," and "fuck"), and even a request for clarification on "chuck on the tits."  The conversation frequently digressed, including anecdotes from Schumer about her relationship with a wrestler and her experiences with Howard Stern.  The hosts and guests discussed paranormal experiences, including haunted hotels (specifically relating to Green's film *The Innkeepers*), ghosts, Bigfoot, and UFOs,  with much vulgarity and speculation.  A significant portion debated the plausibility of ghosts.

Judd Apatow then joined the show, primarily discussing his new film, "This is 40," and the awkward timing of its release following a school shooting.  This led to a discussion about media coverage of tragedies and ethical considerations in entertainment news. Apatow shared his approach to sensitive material, and the hosts discussed their own experiences. The conversation then turned to Apatow's autograph collecting, his experiences directing "This is 40" (including casting Graham Parker and using his family), the film's R-rating, directing intimate scenes, and the use of Viagra.  They debated the current state of television comedy, comparing it to past eras and the influence of shows like "All in the Family" and "Louie."  Apatow discussed his parenting approach and the challenges of filtering content for his children in the digital age,  mentioning his daughter's use of "bunny" as code for inappropriate online content. He also mentioned the upcoming Three Stooges movie.

The next segment centered on the Farrelly brothers' Three Stooges movie, its casting (including Snooki and "The Situation"), and the humor of slapstick comedy.  The hosts debated whether women appreciate slapstick, contrasting it with boys' humor, using an anecdote about one host's son putting a goldfish in another's diaper.  A detailed analysis of various Three Stooges routines followed, comparing different Curly actors. The conversation shifted to a YouTube compilation, "Slaps, Smacks, and Pokes," and the differing reactions of men and women. This segued into a lengthy reminiscence about "The Magic Garden," and a plan to heckle its hosts.  A call from Steve-O followed, with anecdotes including ejaculating on a headshot and his True TV show, "Steve-O's Wild Ride."  He also discussed his tattoos, including an ostrich cover-up, and casual mentions of Christina Aguilera's weight and appearance were made.

Steve-O's guest appearance continued with more outrageous anecdotes.  He recounted encounters with Old Dirty Bastard (ODB), including witnessing ODB smoking PCP on stage and later attempting (and failing) to meet him.  He also detailed a drunken, naked acrobatic tribute to ODB at Rock the Bells, resulting in Raekwon's intervention.  He discussed encounters with other Wu-Tang members, including RZA, and Raekwonâ€™s alleged kidnapping of an artist.  He shared stories of partying with Lindsay Lohan, including finding her wallet and getting a video release form from her in rehab.  He also mentioned encounters with Paris Hilton and described dangerous stunts, including jumping without a parachute and injecting vodka intravenously, as well as a bizarre incident with a coked-out private jet pilot.  The segment later shifted to a bizarre gift: a bag of pre-toasted "Bimbo" bread.  The hosts microwaved the bread on air, speculating on its target demographic and the absurdity of the situation.

The final segment began with the hosts and Sal reacting to a microwave fire caused by Sal attempting to microwave toast. This led to a discussion of the ensuing chaos, smoke, smoke detectors, and potential disciplinary consequences, exacerbated by the microwave being borrowed.  The show then played a clip of Jim Norton's first television appearance on "Friday Night Videos" from 1996.  The hosts and Norton commented on his performance, his nervous demeanor, and the material.  Norton discussed his comedic influences, his father, and his insecurities.  The show concluded with further discussion of the Jim Norton clip, additional jokes, and more commentary on the microwave incident.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It looks like an old school, fuck it. What kind of car would you say? It looks like an old milk truck.  It's like a wood panel, yeah, old milk delivery truck.  And what is it, got Ozzy on it?  Remember making car noises when you'd fucking...  Oh, of course. Dude, what does that have to do with Ozzy, though?  It says Ozzy on it.  Yeah, but what does it have to do with Ozzy?  Well, Ozzy's on it. It's got a picture of Ozzy on the top from Blizzard of Oz.  A picture of Ozzy on the side from Blizzard of Oz, and it says Blizzard of Oz on the other side,  and it says Ozzy on the roof. It's Ozzy car.  Did Ozzy ever have a car like that? 
[00:00:30]  I don't believe he did, no.  They just slapped Ozzy on a fucking Hot Wheels car.  It's perfect. That's what Ozzy drives around in.  I've been at his house, remember?  Yes.  There were three of these in the driveway.  Oh, okay. That makes sense, then.  Yeah.  Yeah, you would make sounds.  Plane car stunk.  You didn't do anything.  It wasn't really much to do.  No, you could only do one at a time, or two of them hitting each other.  You couldn't even do two in a row that well.  It just was boring.  Where do you go with it? 
[00:01:00]  Well, you needed the Hot Wheels track, and the, was it the Tower of Power, or was that  Johnny Lightning cars?  Hot Wheels had the powerhouse.  Powerhouse.  So you'd, uh, you'd, you'd, you'd take the track, and you'd put it, connect to the powerhouse, and make an oval.  And then the powerhouse had two, like, spongy, um, discs, or cylinders inside it.  And the Hot Wheels car would go through, and phoom, get shot out the other side, because this disc is spinning real fast. 
[00:01:30]  And then it would go around, and by the time it got to the powerhouse again, it would go real slow, real slow.  It's just about, phoom, and then it would shoot through again, and whip around again.  That was the powerhouse.  Look for Hot Wheels Powerhouse.  What's wrong with you?  This is the new power tower.  No!  This one has the, look, the hood opens up.  Oh, it shows the little Aussie motor.  So when you're playing cars, you can go, I need repairs.  And then just open it.  Then do what?  Then do what, really?  Why do you open the hood?  Why would I want to park my car with the hood open?  Yeah.  The powerhouse is not fun at all. 
[00:02:00]  You just sit there and watch it go in a circle.  There's the powerhouse.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, and then it would always fall off the track.  I had that.  That's terrible.  You don't think it's a fun gift?  No.  I never had any Hot Wheels tracks.  I had a mat that looked like the road and houses and stuff.  Oh, God.  Oh, yuck.  That's terrible.  I'm just remembering now, like, the big part of the game was I used to make all my cars  get in a traffic jam.  What a fucking cocksucker.  What a horrible game to play. 
[00:02:30]  I would play traffic.  I would line up all my cars, one behind the other on the road, and then that way I could  just look at all my cars.  Did you go beep, beep?  Sam's playing Asian driver again.  Like, the lights in the town wouldn't work or something, and then there would be a traffic  jam because one guy was stuck at the red light, and then I would just look at my car collection  all lined up.  Your imagination's stuck.  Mommy, want to play Rush Hour?  Okay.  All right, Sammy.  Look at him.  Kids love cars, though. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Boys or girls, they don't care.  No.  My daughter asks me to play, you know, race.  She can do that for hours.  Okay.  Is that what she meant when she was over the house and said, play race?  I think I taught her some things.  Yes.  She's been in your house too much.  I'm not race.  But it goes nowhere, but, you know.  Yeah.  How do you play cars with your kid?  What do you do?  It's just racing around the rug for... 
[00:03:30]  She gives you some good shit, though.  You got, like, the little garage thing.  She's got...  Yeah, she's got...  What's a newer...  Like, that was what we had when we were children.  Oh, that was old school.  It was that fucking horrible track.  What's a new car garage or whatever for a little Hot Wheels car?  Here's the current Hot Wheels power tower.  Wow.  What does the power tower do?  That's way better.  It looks like it lifts the car up with some kind of an auger-based elevator and then, like,  drops the car out the top and then it goes around and around.  Do you know what was an amazingly cool thing when you were a kid?  When you'd get the new little car storage box, it was plastic and you could... 
[00:04:00]  Oh, yes.  It looked like a little...  You could store, like, 12 or 20 in there.  Yes, in a little suitcase.  You'd drive...  Yes.  You'd take your little briefcase of cars to school, like you're on a business trip.  I have a meeting, mother.  I have a meeting with my friends.  Smelled like really fresh plastic.  Don't wait up for me.  Yeah, and then you'd have a...  Yeah, yeah, all your cars all set up.  That's perfect for OCD kids.  Oh, yeah.  You could look through them and just, like, fucking fix them.  Eh, so all the blue ones are on this row. 
[00:04:30]  Well, how much fun would it be to open it up and then fuck the order up and the direction  of all the cars of a kid with OCD?  Yeah, they had to be...  Oh, my God.  I would love to scratch a few.  Oh, yeah.  And fucking...  And put, like, sardine oil in it so it didn't smell like plastic.  I'd love to do that to a baby.  He'd hate it.  Kid would fucking weep.  Do they still have those?  What?  Matchbox cars aren't worth money, are they?  No, I've seen...  You always think they're going to be worth money, but they're worthless.  I saw on, I guess, Pawn Stars, some guy brought in a giant Hot Wheels collection, and he wanted 
[00:05:00]  some insane amount of money for it, and it turned out, it's like, no, you know...  Well, they've made, like, so many of them and re-released everything, and there's just...  Yeah.  I mean, you know, there's no market for them.  No.  It's just fucking...  They're just fun to have.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  They give you those...  A little nostalgia.  You look and go, oh, I remember that.  And my mom would be like, okay, it's time for the cars to go, and I'd yell, no, the light's  not green, it's broken.  Oh, you wouldn't.  Yes, I would.  Yes, you would.  I would make her...  I'd make all the cars stay in the traffic jam. 
[00:05:30]  That's like a problem you have.  Yeah, there's...  I psychoanalyze that as you not wanting to advance yourself.  You were happy being your age, with your mommy taking care of you, and you didn't want any  forward movement in your life.  I also analyzed his radio performance as the same thing.  Yeah, you just wanted traffic to stand still.  All the lights are broke, no one can move.  Because as long as those cars weren't moving, mommy was still playing cars with me.  Mommy was playing cars with you and taking care of you. 
[00:06:00]  The second those cars moved, it's, you know, go to school, get a job.  We sat there until I was 19 years old.  I was 19 years old.  Yes.  Just staring at those cars.  Staring.  Oh, what is that one?  1969 Redline Hot Wheels original store display.  Sold for $8,000.  Eight grand?  Well, you know what?  It's not a big market for this.  It's going to sit in my shop.  I'll give you $300 for it.  All right.  I'm happy with what I got. 
[00:06:30]  I was hoping for a million dollars.  Yeah, I was hoping for $8,000 for it,  which is what I paid for it.  But I'm happy with $300.  I think I'm just going to go to the casino a little  and maybe go out to dinner with my wife.  You know, instead of sitting in my closet,  I got a little cash in my pocket,  and we're going to be able to get a nice dinner.  You know, it's about time someone else got a chance to enjoy it.  That's another thing they say all the time to rationalize,  that they were just fucking robbed.  And two days later, they're in the pawn store,  and it's like, $8,000 for this Hot Wheels display.  You said, wait a minute. 
[00:07:00]  How many cars did he have in it?  And were they in good condition?  A few of them were.  Like, he got a good price for a very few of them.  But for the most part, they were just, you know,  eh, your collection stinks.  But what's a legitimately...  $2,200?  No.  Legitimately what?  A good Hot Wheels car to have.  Like an expensive one.  Man.  There's probably a couple.  Probably those collectors' items that, like,  the ones that weren't really sold to the masses, perhaps. 
[00:07:30]  Prototypes?  Things like that.  I remember Johnny Lightning cars sucked.  Why?  Like, if you went over Johnny Lightning,  you'd call your friend a fag.  Because Hot Wheels were cool.  It's like having GoBots.  Really?  Yeah.  As opposed to Transformers?  Yeah, Transformers was the shit.  That was my favorite picture Eric ever sent me.  He sent me a picture of him dressed...  Would be him hanging from a beach.  And the floor collapsing.  All right.  Did I have to tag that? 
[00:08:00]  Come on.  Not only is a poor kid killing himself,  but his heaviness...  His heaviness wrecks the house.  Sorry, Eric.  He just walks out of a collapsed house  with an abrasion on his neck.  Yeah, he looks like fucking...  Like Gandolfini's ex-girlfriend in The Sopranos.  He's cooking.  He's got a fucking scarf on.  Now, Travis is looking at a little pink one.  What's that?  I don't know.  Something from 1973.  I was alive.  Sold for $3,100.  I do kind of remember that car. 
[00:08:30]  Well, that was $3,100.  Why?  I don't know.  It's very rare, apparently.  Oh, look.  1968...  What's it say, though?  Why does it say rare?  Is it a reason for it?  No.  He had a very short description.  1968 rare Hot Wheels Redline Custom Fleet Side Orange...  Heiss?  Is that how you pronounce it?  H-E-I-S-S-E?  Raider Special Paint.  $3,000.  Come on.  Let me see.  I probably have it.  $3,000 for a Hot Wheels car.  That one does look familiar. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, it's foreign.  I remember all those...  Oh, it's not on it.  The paints and the fucking...  Like, the colors.  Sometimes you see a color on something and think like, oh, man, I kind of remember a  Hot Wheels car that color.  Very weird with sticks in your head.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is a German...  German.  It's great.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  So your little track, how would that make the car...  Like, the track is just an oval.  Yeah.  What makes them zoom faster at one point?  Oh, it was the powerhouse had those foam things, like wheels in them, like foam wheels that 
[00:09:30]  were spinning, and the car would go through, kind of like a car wash, but the things were  spinning really fast, and it would throw the car out the other side.  Because I remember...  The only thing I never got into when I was a kid, but I could see it being interesting  is trains.  I love trains.  My father had, like, old Lionel trains, a few of them.  Not many, but he was kind of obsessed with them.  So I kind of thought they were cool, but just never...  Yes.  We never had room to have a fucking real Bobby Bacala train set.  Oh, every Christmas I asked for electric trains. 
[00:10:00]  Electric trains.  Electric trains.  That's all I asked for.  Electric trains.  Shut up!  You got them last year!  But I want more electric trains!  And what a dummy I was.  I went to the...  I got brought to the dentist when I was a kid.  And the dentist's ploy for kids was to give them a little, like, charm kind of  toy thingy.  Like a little plastic fucking...  I don't even know what it was.  Like, I don't know.  A plastic soldier. 
[00:10:30]  Suppository?  A suppository.  Anything really small.  Like something from a penny machine or something.  Something that you can win with the least amount of tickets.  Yeah, things like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Just crap in a big drawer.  Like a spider ring.  In his office.  Yeah, yeah.  Shit like that.  And he goes, oh, you know, we have a toy over here if you want to pick from one.  And I go, do you have electric trains?  Like, I thought I was going to get, like, a nice toy.  What?  Dope.  I know! 
[00:11:00]  Ew, you asked a dentist for electric trains?  I asked a dentist if I could have electric trains.  I love how disgusted Jim always is with your childhood.  I'm terrible as a child.  It's not this.  It's the fact that...  What a dumb question.  How the fuck would a dentist have electric trains?  He said toy.  And when I heard toy as a kid, I thought electric trains.  So he said, oh, you want a toy to, you know, like electric trains?  Oh, we don't have those.  You said...  That's adorable, but it also makes me want to just drill my fist into your young chest. 
[00:11:30]  Give you a good sock in the heart.  Oh, was I an asshole?  Do you have electric trains?  Electric trains, yeah.  To the dentist.  Yeah, let me get out of the fucking toy stock room I have in the back.  I hope he said no and then asked you, is it safe?  Is it safe?  And tortured your teeth.  Give me no clove oil.  The Hot Wheels tracks were also good for beating children with.  They were perfect size. 
[00:12:00]  They were about, I don't know, three feet long per section.  And made of a whippy type of plastic.  But the plastic was soft, so you always ended up stepping on the tracks at some point and bending them.  Yeah, they would bend.  Like you couldn't leave them out because you'd step on them.  Or you'd put them away and then they'd get bent anyway.  And you'd lose the tongues, they called them, to snap the tracks together.  They were like little plastic pieces that went on the bottom of the slots of the thing.  And once you lose those, you'd always try to line up the track on the floor without the things that held it together. 
[00:12:30]  And it would last like one time, the car going through.  And then we'd just stop it.  Imminent fucking disaster when the car would hit it.  Well, you can get one in the box for $12.99 on eBay.  $12.99?  That's right, yeah.  For a supercharger.  That's what it was called, the supercharger.  1969.  Toy.  $12.  I bet that person saw that and went, oh my god, we are rich.  I got it.  Just because shit is old doesn't make it fucking worth anything.  So much stuff is worth nothing. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  I can't believe how much stuff is worthless.  I learned that like looking at, I was at my dad's house and I was looking at all my old  like comic books from like, you know, the 80s and 90s and I punched them in on eBay.  They're all worth less than, than, than the price I covered.  Than the family photos.  Oh shit.  Sorry.  Oh no.  Oh.  But you thought like, you know, like, like when Superman died, you know, they had all  these comics and I was like, oh, I'm going to keep these, you know, and they're worth 
[00:13:30]  like $2 each.  Right.  They're worth nothing.  Well, baseball cards were jacked up at one point, like the 80s and 90s.  No, they weren't.  It was legitimate sales of the cards.  I don't know if, uh, if this is true or not, but Roland just texted me that somebody just  got a new train set on the staff.  Well, someone I bet has room in their new house.  Oh no.  For a train set.  I certainly did.  Does someone have a choo-choo?  What do I say?  Someone likes to choo-choo and has one. 
[00:14:00]  That was good.  Thank you.  That is fucking good.  No.  Oh shit.  Now this is probably just like a regular, it's probably just a regular train set, right?  No.  What do you got?  No.  Really?  Correct.  What'd you get, Eric?  What'd you get?  Just pulling it up right there.  There you go.  What game?  Oh no, you didn't.  Jesus Christ.  No, you didn't.  You're a baby.  I didn't, I don't believe that you got the Harry Potter Hogwarts Express. 
[00:14:30]  I certainly did.  What the fuck are you doing?  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you just get a nice fucking HO gauge fucking old classic train?  Because this one has puffing smoke.  Well, how about the LIE?  Colin Ferguson not included.  Puffing smoke.  So does the fork when he's eating.  See, friction.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock, what made you, what made you get the Hogwarts Express instead of a real like fucking 
[00:15:00]  hobby train set?  Well, the real trains are coming later.  This one is for Christmas.  This one goes around the tree.  That doesn't make sense.  Like a regular train should be the one that goes around the tree.  The regular train is going to be in a whole different section.  A section?  Oh, another wing of the Nagel estate.  This is what drives me.  He's picking up all these hobbies now.  Because he has a house, he has room.  Yeah.  Like now he's starting Lego collecting and now he's starting train sets and the Lego 
[00:15:30]  stuff is a little douchey.  This is not a cheap train set.  How much was it?  Eric?  What is it listing there?  How much?  Well, I see a bunch of different versions.  Oh, let's see.  Which version of the Hogwarts Express did you get?  Mine, it's solid metal too.  It's not like cheap plastic or anything.  Lionel train set.  Lionel.  And I think it was like 200.  That's not bad.  200 bucks.  Wait, is it a whole bunch of trains?  Yeah, it's five cars. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, all right.  Five cars?  Yeah.  Is it a caboose?  Yep, it has a caboose.  And how much track?  Enough to go around the tree?  Yeah, it's pretty big.  And a circle or an oval?  A circle.  Oh, I hate a circle.  It's constantly turning.  Oh, here it is.  Just a choo-choo.  Oh, Hogwarts Express coming through.  That's good.  Are you all excited that you're like a fucking warlock?  No.  When you watch it, do you imagine yourself shrinking and going into the fucking train? 
[00:16:30]  You don't have to like jump on the track or something?  Yeah.  How does that work?  Do you ever, like when it comes to the tunnel, do you go, yay!  Like a big retard?  Yay!  Like a big retard.  I haven't bought the tunnel yet.  Like a big retard.  If I'm on my own on this, disregard it.  But I'm interested in what Troy Kwan thinks about the amount of disposable income that  Iraq has that he could just buy a train site.  Well, I mean, it's amazing.  Troy might actually agree with this one.  He might.  Troy's a big train bub.  Hey, let's grab him. 
[00:17:00]  He's a train guy.  My question is...  Is he a train buff?  Yes.  Well, I went to Pennsylvania and was on the train.  He likes to train.  Yeah.  That's true.  He likes pulling trains.  At some point, I want to do it right.  Have a whole landscape set up.  Oh, that whole thing.  A huge train set up is really, my God.  And then blow it up.  Wow.  Oh, fuck yeah.  What is the other Lionel one you're getting?  Like, what's the newer one?  You're getting another one, right?  A Lionel...  More of an old-fashioned one, though.  You know, like the ones that would haul coal and things like that. 
[00:17:30]  Not ones that would take Harry Potter to Hogwarts.  Right, right.  That's just for Christmas.  Oh, for Christmas.  Hey, that's great.  That's pretty cool.  You're going to get an engineer hat?  Yeah, you have to.  And, like, an oil can and just stand there working the little control?  Does the Transformer on train sets still smell like it's ready to burst into flames when  you fucking fire them up?  Yeah, it kind of does.  It's like, are there wires just, you know...  Dude!  You'd think that things just going to go up any second. 
[00:18:00]  Every train set I've ever had when I was a kid, you go to, like, start it up, you plug  in the Transformer, you hear, like, and then you get the throttle going, and you smell  like this fucking ozone-ish, electric, ready-to-burst-into-flame smell.  When I was, like, when you see, like, I mentioned Bobby Bach Club, but when you see an adult  with a real, like, old-school train collection, like, fucking a really nice, that I can kind 
[00:18:30]  of get collecting.  Yeah.  That's, like, a real collector's...  And they, it's very hobby-oriented, because they put together all those scenes, they put  the trees in, and all the little, like, lakes, and, you know, it's kind of a hobby.  You're building it.  But they're, and they're old, you can buy old ones, like the old scenes.  Poor Bobby.  Poor Bobby Bacala.  Oh, it's the best fucking, one of the best murder scenes in the entire fucking...  Could you turn it up?  Yeah.  Oh, here, poor Bobby.  I'm gonna go for it.  I'm gonna go for it.  Your son will like this, too.  He's supposed to be fast.  A nice blue one.  Oh, he's gonna buy the train.  That is nice. 
[00:19:00]  He don't care.  Oh.  They're showing, if you haven't seen this, they're showing a little train car on the tracks,  and a man's coming in to not be nice to Bobby.  Oh, no.  Oh, here they come.  Is Iraq pondering buying the Harry Potter train?  Yeah, the Harry Potter train.  Yes, the two other guys from the staff coming in.  Oh!  Jesus.  What a bad scene.  That's good.  You like it? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, that is good.  Poor Bobby.  They're showing, like, hearing screaming, and you see the little guys on the tracks with  their hands over their mouths.  Damn, did they fucking fill him full of lead.  Oh, jeez.  That was a great fucking kill scene.  Poor Bobby.  Hurry up.  Bobby Bacala.  Wow.  Yeah, that's fucking...  Watching those scenes makes me want to watch the entire thing.  I know!  Yeah.  Right?  Absolutely.  Troy Kwan. 
[00:20:00]  Gentlemen.  Wondering what you think about Iraq's massive amount of disposable income to buy these train  sets, and he has future plans of setting up his own railroad.  Amazing.  The Nagel Express.  The Nagel Express!  The Nagel Express!  He's gonna do cars on people.  It's still happening.  Choo-choo.  Yeah, I mean, he's just got this amazing income coming in, and he's just able to sort  of live this... 
[00:20:30]  Extravagant.  Extravagant, childlike lifestyle.  Yeah.  lifestyle. Yeah. And, uh, you know, he was talking yesterday, he's put in more TVs in  his place. What? Yeah. He did it on the after show yesterday. He mentioned that, uh, he's  got five flat screens in his house now and he's looking at adding at least a sixth. Five  flat screens at the Nagel Estates. Well, he's got a wall that it's actually a really cool  site. He's got a really nice house. It's like a living room and there's a wall there, but  you can walk around either side of it. Okay. And around the back of the wall is like kind 
[00:21:00]  of a porch in the sense that it's all glass. It's indoors, but it's all glass. And he's  got on the one. Is it a Florida room? It's a Florida room. Coming from Florida. Yeah.  Yeah. He just calls it where I grew up room. Right. Right. Um, so he's got the TV on the  one side of the wall where the fireplace is and he's putting a TV right on the other side  on the other side. It's like a two sided TV. Right. In the wall. Right. Wow. And then he's  putting a theater outside as well. A movie theater. Yeah. Yeah. He's going to put a movie theater 
[00:21:30]  in his backyard. Outside. I wouldn't know. I've never been invited over, but I imagine  it's a really. Oh boy. I'm very fond of Eric and very fond of his wife. And I've been  invited. You just couldn't attend. The only reason you did those when I was not there.  So I don't remember being invited. He invited you over once when he specifically knew that  you and I would both be in San Diego. I don't remember getting an invite. You probably never  did. Actually, you said you were coming and then didn't show. Whoops. Right. That could be  true. Oh, Iraq. I'm sorry about that. Where you live? Jersey? Yeah. Maybe. We need that shit. Yeah. 
[00:22:00]  Exactly. You're just going to go to an old intern's pool party, but. Wow. Yeah. Well,  live and learn, right? Yes. Yeah. I lived and learned on that one. Especially now that  Iraq is decorating his house with tchotchkes. What are tchotchkes? It's going to look like  an Applebee's in his room downstairs. Your man can have like trains and road signs on the  walls. License plate. License plate. Yeah. Nice. Just a little something to make it his. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah. Personalize his man cave. Mm-hmm. Man cave. What were you guys talking about  on the after show yesterday that Iraq said his wife wouldn't allow or something? A scale?  I'm sorry. Oh, the hot tub. Oh, right. A hot tub. I was driving home and I'm like, oh, Jesus.  I got to get into this. How do you, why, why? What's wrong with your wife that she doesn't  like a hot tub? I was corrected later on. Oh, you were? To the fact that she would love 
[00:23:00]  to have a hot tub. Well, then why did you say that before? Because I honestly thought she  had said no at one point. Well, can you take out? No. She was commenting on the temperature  in the room to him. It's hot. Hot tub. She called him tub. Hot tub. Oh, wordplay. Was  there a karma? Holy fuck. You like your house? Was your house built new? No. Oh, okay. 
[00:23:30]  It's an old, it's an old, old house. It feels new, though. It doesn't feel like an old house.  It's been renovated. How far from the city are you? Uh, 15 miles. That's not big. That makes  you want a house. It's not bad. It's right by, uh, like, a giant stadium area. Oh, okay.  How bad does traffic come in in the morning? It's nothing. In the morning. In the morning  is nothing, really. It's just jokes galore. Well, it's a giant stadium. Uh-huh. Oh, like 
[00:24:00]  the stadium was named it. Well, you know, something. Something like that. Uh, now, what did she  say about the hot tub? She would love one. So you're gonna get rid of that silly garden of  hers and put a hot tub in there and get some bitches? Garden? Yeah, she, the house had  a huge, like, three-part garden in the backyard. Waste of prime real estate. Yeah. Um, so  this spring we'll get the new fencing put in. The backyard will be remodeled. Oh. Do  a hot tub. This sounds. Must be nice. Troy, man, right? It's gotta feel good. This guy's  just fucking shelling out the money. Boom, boom. But a hot tub makes sense to me. I can 
[00:24:30]  see why you'd want that. Oh, yeah. In the winter. Yeah. Yeah. Sit there, watch the snow  come down. It's awesome. Oh, boy. Yeah, I get that. But he's got plans. I mean, I think  Troy's point is more, all these plans for major renovations and still it's nothing to  drop $200 on a Harry Potter train. May a bag of shells. Right. Just like, he makes it  rain. He's just sitting there firing off. Oh, at the toy store. Oh, yeah. Harry Potter  train's like, yeah, niggas! And he's just fucking flying hundreds off. Yeah. You think Eric just 
[00:25:00]  has a ton of Jeffrey bucks lying around? Yeah, he does. Jeffrey dollars. Jeffrey dollars  from Toys R Us. He's like Scarface, but he doesn't have a lion. He has like little child  things around the house. The fridge is yours. You are very childlike, E-Rock. Yeah. Yeah.  You just got this nice income you can just sort of do as you please, you know? Right? I don't  know why we all don't do that. Well, because we don't have that income. Oh. All right.  Look, I might be guilty of purchasing a few toys myself. Yeah, but. But, you know. You're 
[00:25:30]  a millionaire. What are you going to do? Right. That's well established. Make a little  more money. I understand. Are you saying Anthony's earned it? No, I'm saying Anthony  literally twit pics photos of stacks of cash that make up about four years of my salary.  And then in one minute, one hand, they're gone. Easy come, easy go. Whoops, the dealer  took it. That's a weekend though, right? That sucks. Ah, you know what? Did you see all of  Eric's Simpsons Christmas items? Oh, no. He's got a bunch of those little, like, they 
[00:26:00]  would be, like, collectibles, like Hummels, but they're Simpsons. E-Rock. Things. How many  do you have of those, E-Rock? I think there's 33, 36. Are they in a case? No, they're on  display right now, but. On display. Like it's fucking. Like the museum. Yeah, like a museum  has it for a limited time. Make sure you see this display. How much do one of those run?  Uh, you have to buy them in sets of three. What? And how much is, like, a set of three?  Uh, 30, 35 dollars? Oh, boy. Times 11. Let's do some math. So wait, you buy them at 
[00:26:30]  toy conventions? No, you have to order online. They're special made. What's the fascination  with Simpsons stuff? I understand the show, you know, you get some laughs. But what about,  why so much Simpsons things? Blocks out the pain.  Same fascination with Harry Potter trains. Harry Potter trains. Legos. Anything. Eric likes  childish toys and stuff. Yeah. Yes. What was your favorite toy store as a kid?  Favorite what? Toy store. Toy store? Was it just Toys R Us or, uh, or KB? Do you remember Myers? 
[00:27:00]  KB stunk. Yeah, I do. KB stinks. Like, Toys R Us is cool. You go in there, there's a bunch  of toys. It's really good. KB is, like, a lot of very childish toys. Yeah, you know why a lot  of kids liked KB because they were in a lot of malls. Yeah. So they were really  easy for us to get. Yeah. And Toys R Us was a standalone. Yeah. Especially the ghetto  malls. Yeah. Toys R Us was, like, fucking, ha, ha, ha. Oh, yeah. There was a weird vibe  when you'd walk in there, right? You couldn't believe how many, no, Toys R Us, like, Toys  R Us. Couldn't believe how many toys there were. There were toys everywhere. Eric still 
[00:27:30]  gets that vibe. Oh, E-Rock. It's not the same now, but. I want to go into one. Like, you'd  walk in, it would just be a wall of toys, and then you'd go around, and you were actually  in the store. And really high ceilings made it just seem endless. The smart places  had high ceilings. Let me tell you. Cathedral of toys. It's not what you think. Yeah, it's  not what it used to be. No? No. It's all baby stuff, mostly. There's a big one in the  city I went into recently to kill time, to look at the Legos. Yeah. I mean, that place  is really cool. Poor times family. Poor times family. Went in there to kill time. 
[00:28:00]  Wow. I love giving Jimmy a taste of his own medicine. Yeah. I still go into Toys R Us like  twice a month. For what? Wrestlers. Oh, God. I almost never buy them anymore, but I can't  stop myself. Yeah, I can't stop. In fact, you know that that's happening. You're with 
[00:28:30]  wrestling. You're like edging with wrestling toys. Yes! Yeah, I mean, I don't really sit  there stroking your pud in front of a fucking King Kong Bundy hat. Shut up. The fascination  with wrestling between you and, like, E-Rock and stuff is just astounding. That's where  we meet. Yeah, is that your common bond? That's it. I don't get it when you're almost  30, though. From the skateboarding guy. Well, skateboarding is actually, I'm doing something 
[00:29:00]  that's exercise. You don't do skateboarding for exercise. I do, too. You do skateboarding  because it's cool, man. I do because it's good exercise. You're actually doing something.  You just sit on the couch. Look, we all have our childish things that we're trying to adhere  to youth with. I'm wearing a Walt Disney World shirt. Exactly. And you love Disney. And  I love it. The happiest place on earth. I, of course, with my electronic toys and whatnot,  I love a good toy. I love a good toy. Troy, come on. You can fess up. The skateboarding 
[00:29:30]  thing. It's very juvenile. Well, yeah, but it's still fun. It's not what a normal man of your  age would do. Yeah, but don't you think it's... No, that's not true. No, it isn't. But wrestling,  you're just sitting, and you know it's fake. You know it's completely fake. Yeah. It's  like all television. Yeah, but you're just watching, it's like watching like a soap opera  with like half-naked men. Right. People watch television. There's actually a huge business  for scripted television. No, absolutely. And people, there's millions of people who on a 
[00:30:00]  daily basis will sit down and watch it and enjoy it. Some will even spend money on it.  HBO, for instance. You're saying that many of the shows on television are fake and scripted?  Yeah. And I hate to tell you this, but Homeland, whether he's a terrorist or the vice president,  he's actually just a British dude pretending the whole time. Oh, man. Fucking don't ruin  it. I know. So you're saying it's not entertainment, it's entertainment entertainment. It's entertainment  entertainment. Okay. Good way to spend it. Sam's very good at... Sam is good at fucking, 
[00:30:30]  you know, skirting the issue, as they say. Well, it's like thinking people come in like  scripted television is just like, why would you watch scripted television? Right, right.  Well, I don't. I don't watch television. You're too busy skateboarding and looking for the  latest fall fashion. Yeah. Taking pictures of people I want no part of in lower Manhattan.  Every fucking picture you take of other people in lower Manhattan and stuff when you're hanging  out. The lunatics. I look like I don't even want to get near that motherfucker. Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  There's no part of you that's like, that's where I'd like to hang out. It's like, yeah,  Troy's thing's like, cool, just chilling down here fucking like lower Manhattan and shit.  And I'm like, yeah, get me out of there. If you see the freaky people, the last picture  I posted on my Instagram was there was a guy with a cat walking around with a cat on his  head. And you're like, what the fuck are you doing? That guy, I think I've seen him.  Yeah, he walks around New York City a lot. The cat like sits on his head, right? Yeah. It's  not like laying down on his head like a hat. Yeah. I wish you were on 58th Street the other 
[00:31:30]  day and you snapped a photo of a guy reaching into his pocket behind another guy. Hold  a smile. Oh, shit. Oh, yeah. Is he a beggar? Yeah. Yes. No, no, no. Of course. The ones  with the animals. Yeah. Is that you laying on your back with the slayer thing? Look at  them. What are they doing? No, that's a that I'm getting my chest. Oh, I could go see what  that lady was doing. What the fuck? He's getting a tat and then he's fucking hanging  out and then he's hanging out some more. And now, look, look, there's people. What is 
[00:32:00]  that? That's my girlfriend and another chick. We were hanging out. What's going on there?  Why are you outside? It was just a street sale. I was just like, let's just take a funny picture.  Your girlfriend's very attractive. Thank you. A little graffiti. There you go. There's  a train. Oh, look at your house. That was at Strasburg Railroad in Lancaster. You're a fan of  trains. Love trains. Yeah, I grew up. I do like a good train myself. Have you ever  ridden a steam locomotive like that? Never. You should go and check that out. It's a  lot of fun. Now you're just bragging. And then there's a railroad museum there. They 
[00:32:30]  have all these old steam engines and old trains. Yeah. Very nice. I remember the  Freedom Train out in California when I was a kid. The Freedom Train was an Amtrak train  made its way around the country during, I think, the bicentennial. Me being a child of  the 80s. The bison what? The bicentennial. Bison. In the studio. Oh, you're right. It  never ends. The bicentennial. Oh, I saw a movie about that once. I didn't think it was real. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, it was the 200th birthday of these United States. Like history. Yeah. And the Freedom  Train would go around and everybody was excited for when the Freedom Train was going to be coming.  And it was cool because they had like history inside. You know, it was like a rolling museum  that would go around the country and it stopped in San Juan Capistrano at the world famous Capistrano  Depot. That's what it was? That looks like, I have no idea. I didn't really pay much attention 
[00:33:30]  to it. It's pretty cool. Is it the Freedom Train? 1976? 1976. Yeah, yeah. Most of us weren't  even born yet. I was but a wee lad. What do you mean you born, Troy? 77. Oh, man. You  just missed. Son of a bitch snuck in under the wire. That's right. You just missed the  Freedom Train. Get on the Freedom Train. That was just fucking Amtrak before they were completely  broke, I guess. Are they broke? It's exciting. Amtrak's always running at a loss. Doesn't  the government run it now so it can't make any fucking money? It loses money like everything 
[00:34:00]  else the government runs. What's a really valuable Lionel Train? Like what is, because  those are the things that are worth a lot of money because people couldn't collect them  like you could baseball cards. Well, that's true. And they had to be kept in good shape.  Yeah. Things in the box are always worth a lot of money? Yeah. Because that's most kids  back, especially in the 50s and 60s, did not. Man, did I like opening up a Christmas present  and seeing electric trains. I was like, oh, this is fucking great. I don't know if I ever got 
[00:34:30]  them for Christmas, to be honest with you. Open up it. And that locomotive, you'd just  be like, yeah, that's your locomotive. Had some weight to it. Ah. You like it better  than getting slot cars? Uh, yeah. I wasn't a big fan of the slot. Although, no, you know  what? What was that? The AMX, was it called? There was a slot car set. I remember, um, the  commercial had Jackie Stewart, the race car driver in it. Look at those cars really hug the  road. You would fucking do the commercial for the AMX cars or something. Yeah, there 
[00:35:00]  you go. Oh, if you had the car and train set with that amazing one piece, which is the  railroad crossing. And it would have the car track and the train track over it, and you  put it together. And, uh, amazing. Amazing. Try to have the train hit the cars? Yes. Tyco,  thank you. AMX was slightly larger than Tyco. I had the Tyco cars. Tyco. And you'd, uh, 
[00:35:30]  they were always flying off the track, though. You'd have to, yeah, I hated having a, try to  keep it on the fucking track. You have to pick something to collect. I had Tyco cars.  You had Tycos, right? Yeah. Yeah. Tyco cars. These were great. You need a big house to  collect shit like that. Like, I saw those Mego toys recently. Like, I was fucking, like, I  wanted to buy, I didn't buy any. They're really expensive. Like, when I had them as a kid.  There's a big market for Mego. Because I, the little 12-inch, they're not even good.  I had, like, Hulk and the fucking Fantastic Four, Captain America, all of those when I 
[00:36:00]  was a kid. I loved those things. Yeah. But in the box, like, fucking four grand. No  way. I can't spend that. That expensive? Yeah. That's kind of crazy. Just look at them.  Hey, look at that. To a girl. She's 20. Hey. Want to eat my cock? She's playing with  them. Yeah, they made a lot of stuff. A lot of stuff. They were the first company to, like,  license. I think I see, uh, the Enterprise Bridge up there. Holy shit. That looks like  a good one. I want that. Migos are the shit. I had fucking Yugos. Well, me here. Fuck, 
[00:36:30]  whatever, man. I'll play that game. I'll fucking date you, fucker.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. Mysterious. XM.  Blowin' up, man. Yes.  Yeah. When is your show premiere? That's not nice to say. April 30th.  Wow, really? Yeah. Okay, so until you get some time. No, I'm, you know what, I'm thin  right now. Here's why. I did a photo shoot for Vanity Fair yesterday. Oh, good. So  I didn't eat, like, I ate like you're supposed to eat all week. Yeah. Like, girls eat that are 
[00:37:00]  on television, like how, what I should be doing all the time. It was the worst week. Have you ever  tried to, like, lose weight? It's so awful. I don't know how anyone can live like that  for. It was like, you were conscious of it all the time? It was like. Yeah, you crave  everything. Just vegetables and, like, some protein. Oh, it was, it was a miserable, I was  like, that's why models are such cunts, because they're just starving. They're just always  hungry. Yeah. And then I revenge ate and drank. Yeah. For 24 hours. Nice. Oh, you made  weight. Yeah. I got, I got myself back up. You made weight and then it's like, okay, now 
[00:37:30]  I can eat. I'm ready to fight again. Yeah. All right.  I don't know. When, uh, 4th of July, that party, you were in that fucking bikini there.  Yeah. Pretty goddamn good. Okay. That's nice to hear. Pretty goddamn good. Yeah. Television  adds 90 pounds. Does it? Oh, boy. Yeah. It does. And I, I look like a cabbage patch  anyway, so. Jesus. And I was like, that's right there. You just upset Jimmy. Jimmy's  going to throw up. Yeah. Jimmy's, uh, Jimmy's out of here. Sorry, Jimmy. He left. Jimmy's  Yeah. It was, ugh. Not eating, it's, I mean, it sucks. Yeah. So is that your first fucking 
[00:38:00]  foray into how you're going to turn all Hollywood and shit? No. Oh my God. An eating disorder  would be great. Never. I would love to like. You know, I'm not someone that, I don't think  I'm someone that would look. I, like, you know when girls lose all that weight, you're  like, we didn't need you to do that, Christina Ricci. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Jennifer Goodwin,  like, put, have a sandwich. Nobody needs you to be a wife. I would love to get, I'd love  you to get to the point where you, like, you're checking out at the supermarket and you look  over at the tabloids and there's, like, Amy just emaciated, getting her mail from the  fucking, like, the mailbox looking at the camera, got all mad. With the headline, what 
[00:38:30]  happened to Amy? Yeah, yeah. And I'm just, I thought this is what you wanted. Family's  worried about Amy Schumer. Skeleton. Or, or good, good cellulite picture with, with a whole  bunch of Hollywood babes. Oh, I can give him that right now. I'll take that right now. That  one's always my favorite where they just show you the cellulite and you have to guess whose  ass. Yeah. Whose body it's on. Don't, you know, look, I'm a fucking prick, man. I know  it. But, but like, that is really just, that's gotta kill people. It's like going, oh, whose 
[00:39:00]  ass is this? Who's disgusting ass is in our magazine? And here are the names, the little  key. Right. With the A is, you know, if those people are looking, you gotta be like, oh man.  That sucks. But who, who are the people that buy those magazines mostly? The people I see  on planes, it's these fat chicks from the Midwest who are wearing a sweatshirt over a turtleneck.  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mom haircut, terrible jeans. And they're like, she looks, she looks  stupid in this Gucci dress. And you're like, really? Right. Like you're, you know, you're 
[00:39:30]  going home alone. Yeah. You have a ton of cats to feed. They're cats. Yeah. She's going  home with cats. But you think Brittany has taken a turn for the worse, you know? Everything  she owns is covered with hair and stinks like piss. Yeah. Nice. Nice. Her exposure.  We'll be on hoarders and nothing else. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you're like, I don't know,  you're, you're right on that fucking Hollywood thing there, Amy. We've seen this a lot.  Really? Man. So we just want to like soak you in before you just say those. Soak me in. 
[00:40:00]  God, I remember that. That's what I say. I remember when Amy used to do the show. I just  keep going, soak me in. Soak me in. Guys love it. They're like, that doesn't make any sense.  I'm like, shut up. I mush their face. Soak me in. Are we setting another one free today?  I don't know. I think so. So many people that used to do our show. Remember when they used  to do our show? Who? Like who? Who? Remember when Louis C.K. used to beg to come on?  Remember when Louis C.K. did our show? Doesn't he still do it? Oh, he'll come on at his leisure.  Right. He'll get to us eventually. And, and that, that's it. The eventually is getting further 
[00:40:30]  apart each time. Further apart, yes. Sure. Now hosting SNL and, you know, and him and the tabloids  are taking pictures of him in his stalled out boat. Yeah. In the middle of the, like  he's fucking, uh, goddamn Aristotle Onassis. Well, he loves boating. Oh, yeah, his boat.  Yeah. Yeah, it stalled out. Oh, God, I really want to, it did? Yeah. What happened?  And they have pictures of him, like, beached on the boat, trying to start it. On a cell phone  just waiting for help. Yeah, waiting for help. And they're taking pictures of him like he's  fucking Tom Cruise. He's using his Emmys to try and row back in. 
[00:41:00]  That's great. Yeah, guy, I'm going to throw you this line. Right. I tied my Emmy to it.  Catch. He's using it as an anchor. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, it's too much weight. You have  to throw the Emmys overboard. No. He's like, no, I'm going down with the ship. He's throwing  his children overboard instead. But I could see him, I could see him throwing his Emmys in  the river. Yeah. I really could, I could see that. Yeah, you would do it. That's something  that Louis would do. But then a week later, he would, you'd be, he'd be in scuba gear.  Oh, you think? Yeah. I don't want to get that shit. I don't know why I did that. I shouldn't  have done that. Stupid. I could, I could use this. I think he'll do well on SNL. I 
[00:41:30]  think so. I can't wait to see him on there. I can't wait to see what he does with it.  Cause, uh, SNL is not a show I watch anymore, but knowing Louis is going to be fucking hosting.  I can't wait. Yeah. That's going to be crazy. You still watch SNL? Oh, I watch it. Just  force a habit. I'm sorry. What? Yeah. What? She's, she's defending SNL. So no, I'm not,  I'm not, but I still watch it as forth. Do you like it still? Uh, it, it, my, the laughs  for me are few and far between. Yeah. But yeah, I, it just still makes me excited to 
[00:42:00]  hear somebody say live from New York at Saturday night. That was my favorite growing up. So  I always have that hope that it's going to be good again. No, but I do like a lot of the  people on there. They make me laugh, but just, yeah, it's a, it, I don't know what, like  why it's sort of, it's kind of just a fixture now. It's just there kind of comfort. I think  it's the work schedule that fucks up that show where they have to get all that together  in one week. Those poor people. I just, it doesn't seem appealing to sleep deprived.  Yeah. I don't know. It used to work back in the day, but. Cause everybody was fueled by 
[00:42:30]  like drugs and sex, but they're all just like, and now they got human resources over  there. I'm sure. Totally. Where the lady's like, look, these guys can only work eight  hours at a time, not 28 hours in a row. Yeah. You're right. They work. They're not people  that my friends who've worked there. They just, they do not have lives while they're there.  It's bad. Yeah. Everyone we've talked to that came out of there. So it's a pretty tough  life to do. And there's always like little clicks and fights and infighting. Brewer's  SNL stories. Oh my God. Jim Brewer's hilarious. You get a few beers at him, man. Just let 
[00:43:00]  him talk. Let me tell you about that fucking asshole. But you know, like you think, I remember  you just think somebody's on there. They're just rich. You're like, okay, you're on that show  once you're rich. And then you'll see a lot of these guys that used to be on there, maybe  a year or two. And then they're back out on the road. Yeah. And it's just like, there's  a sadness to it. And there's, I mean, that's great that they got to that level. I haven't  been on that show, but you're just like, oh, we just thought you were rich. Yeah. You 
[00:43:30]  were done and rich. You want, you think that's sad. I used to think Opie was rich when he  was at BAB. He was on the radio at BAB. Yeah. See, he showed me. Me and I got together.  I'm like, hey man, you got to come by my place so we can figure some shit out. I was like, fuck,  because I was still in construction. And all I'm thinking is like, he's fucking iron  gates. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He had a pretty new like blazer at the time and shit. I'm just  like, all right. That's 10 blazer. Green. Cool. Green. Kind of cool. So, uh, wow. He's  inviting me to his house. This is like fucking pretty cool. And he goes to Northport, which 
[00:44:00]  is a pretty nice neighborhood in Long Island. So I'm pulling up and I make the turn away from  the nice part of Northport to the other part. Yeah. Yeah. And, and he pulls up in front  of a house and I'm like, what are we stopping somewhere? We gotta be like, I'm following  him in my shitty car. Yeah. Yeah. This has to be like something. And then all like, I just  kept trying to convince myself. I'm just saying to myself, it's gotta be like his summer place  or something. You just like sitting in Northport, a second home or something. And then I found 
[00:44:30]  out, no, no, no, you don't make any fucking money radio. Yeah. It takes so much money to  live. Well, I'm like, I have some money now and I still live like total dog shit. Everyone  increases that fucking little step though. We're never smart. It's always like, like, Oh,  if I lived the lifestyle I was living with this money, right? I'm golden. But then you always 
[00:45:00]  go, man, I could buy that. I'll step that up a little bit more and that. And, and then  you're like, okay. And then you make a little more money. It's like, Oh, good. I could, I  could kick it up a little more. Yeah. If I was living like I was knocking tin with fucking  three roommates and shit. You'd be wearing a suit with dollar signs all over it. Yeah.  It'd be great. Yeah. Money in the bank. No. Money, money, money. I have two roommates right  now. So you're still a roommate girl. Why? Well, you saw my place. Um, it was like, I wanted  to go badly too. I wanted her to have the baby on my roof. Um, that was cool though. Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  I heard I missed a good one too. It was good. It wound up being crazy. Questlove DJed. Questlove  was fucking DJing. On your roof? On my roof. On the roof. It was really fun. Were the neighbors  pissed? No. I mean, we ran out the roof. Oh, cool. Very cool. Um, but, uh, yeah, but no,  what happened was my friend Tig, uh, Nataro, who Louie just promoted her album on his website. 
[00:46:00]  You can still get her album on Louie's website. Uh, she got, she's one of the writers on my  TV show. She got diagnosed with breast cancer and, uh, was like, lives in LA and was like,  uh, breast cancer. And I was like, yeah, I was like, Oh shit. But, uh, I was like, we'll  still move here. Just like, we'll live together. And, um, and her best friend, Kyle, who's  also a writer on my show. And so they moved in with me and we, and, uh, Tig got both of 
[00:46:30]  her breasts removed. So this is the show, right? This is my, yeah. Oh, see, I thought it was  the show because no way this is reality. This is real. This is real. She got a double mastectomy  and the cancer is now totally gone. She only has a 7% chance of recurrence. So now I have  these two 40 something year old roommates for no reason. Like she's totally healthy.  Like Kyle and I thought, I thought I was going to be like decorating her head scarves and like 
[00:47:00]  holding a bin under her while she, she's healthier than anyone. So now I just live, we just weirdly  all live together.  So how long before you are right? Look, um, well they both live in LA and, uh, their contracts  are kind of up on my show in, uh, November. So I think, you know, a couple of months, like  maybe after the new year, I'll be like, Hey, look, uh, Craigslist has a lot of new friendly  listings. Uh, check this out. Yeah, but it's, it's fun. They have bunk beds. Really? Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  Wow. Yeah. It's fun for some reason. It's like a little fucking like camp over there. I  know. I know. I can have bunk beds as an adult. They're doing it. They almost got one with  a slide to get down. I like being that close to the ceiling for some reason. Do you? Yeah.  I kind of like it. I don't know. I always got the bottom bunk. I was talking to my brother  had the bunk beds and I had the bottom bunk. I liked it cause my father could never get  a good swing with his belt. I was trying to fucking hit me with the belt. It would like  hit the top of the bunk. He'd have to do some weird fucking sidearm pitch with the fucking, 
[00:48:00]  uh, with the belt to try to get in there, but he could never get the leverage. And Joe,  on the other hand was on a top bunk. And when you're swinging top like that, that fucking  thing would come and whip down on him. So Joe is getting the shit beat out of him.  Poor planning, Joe. Ah, yeah. I'm going to build a loft. Yeah? Yeah. Like I'm back in  college. Levels. Put a little couch under it. Levels. I want levels now, man. Fuck this.  Living like an adult crap. Yeah. It really is for shit. What's the show about, by the way? 
[00:48:30]  Um, it's, uh, it's called Inside Amy Schumer and it's just sort of like about-  Oh, God. It's about cabbies. Yeah. It's all, it's all just me interviewing cab drivers.  Do you regret telling that story on our show? No, I don't. They bring it up a lot. I should,  right? Oh, please. Every, every- They bring it up a lot, these people. How about every  interview? Like I'll be getting interviewed in Vegas. Some nice reporters, like what's  the cab story? People ask me to ask me about the cab story. Someone just wrote, matter of 
[00:49:00]  fact, they saw you somewhere. I think it was Charlotte. Were you in Charlotte recently?  I was just in Charlotte. And they're like, Amy was hilarious in Charlotte, but she didn't  tell the cab story. When I say, does anyone have any requests? Nine times out of 10, it's  cab story. I'm like, all right. I tell it. I don't regret it. I don't, I don't regret  anything I've said on here yet. Yet. Yet. Yeah. You gave Howard a lot of good dirt. Yeah.  Yeah, man. I don't hold out any, I would tell you guys anything. I know. We didn't ask 
[00:49:30]  the right questions, I guess. Damn it. When you were, uh, that comes in experience. And  people fucking beat us up for it. Like, why didn't you guys get the scoop on Amy and the  wrestler? Oh. I remember the time. Oh, you knew I was dating him. But I remember, yeah,  at the time, you wanted it on the QT for a little bit. Yes. Thank you. But then you gave  a lot of details on Howard, how the sex was ridiculous. It was athletic. Right. You were, like,  exhausted. And you know me. Were you out of your league? I like, like, I like laying  there. A little mellow, more relaxed. Just laying around. Yeah. I like somebody to have 
[00:50:00]  to hold a mirror under me to see if I'm awake or alive. Uh, yeah, we, yeah, we totally,  there's a lot of crossover. I went to a couple of his events and ONA fans would see me there  and yell to me. Probably something about a cab. Probably. But anyway, what's the show about?  So it's inside Amy. Yeah. It's, uh, it's some standup and me talking to people on the street,  kind of like those real sex interviews and, uh, and some CDs in the pilot. Nice. Yeah. Oh, 
[00:50:30]  you guys didn't see the pilot? No, I have to show it to you. I am. Are you happy with the  pilot? I love it. I love the, it seems like it's going to be an awesome show. Nice. That's,  I hope so. That's pretty goddamn exciting. Yeah. I can't believe that my favorite are the,  the letters from standards and practices. It's a funny thing. Oh, really? It'll be like,  okay, addressing this scene. Um, you, we cannot show Amy being penetrated from behind. We cannot 
[00:51:00]  show, we cannot see the actual hand job. Maybe you could insinuate the motion just like the most  clinical description of the shit we wrote. Been there. Uh, they take all the funny out of shit.  Standards and practices are rough on any network. They're terrible because their whole job  is to, is to, but they always go too far. They know they can help you out a little bit,  but they choose not to ever. And they just don't want to lose their job. Yeah. They just don't want  to lose their job. We had lawyers at CBS radio drove us completely insane with the nonsense they 
[00:51:30]  would give us on our bits and, and, and our show in general. Because it's not necessary.  Especially on cable. It wasn't going to be. Because on cable, there's no FCC. Right. Yeah. Yeah.  In your case. They make it up. Right. But still the, I have to show you these emails. They're  hilarious. You should bring them in and read them. That'd be funny. Yeah. I could pull it up on my  phone. Yeah. I would love to. Yeah. Oh, hell yeah. Talk amongst. Yeah. I want to see that.  Tom Green's here as well. Oh yeah. Tom, Tom Green. No, no. You stay there. You stay right the fuck there.  Put Tom over there. Yeah. Put Tom where Danny is. And then we got Tom, we got Jim, Amy, and Tom. 
[00:52:00]  We got to shove everybody in. Tom, Jim, and Amy. We ran late with, uh, Brandon Steiner.  How long did we talk to him for? Way longer than we thought we would. I think two. How  long did we talk to him for? Two? Long. Oh. Were you bored? No. That wasn't your thing. It's  not my cup of tea. I understand. Jimmy loves collectibles and stuff and you're a sports guy  and, uh, I'm a degenerate piece of shit filth. So, uh, yeah. Okay. I'm that too. Oh, that's 
[00:52:30]  true. But you two collect things. Uh, I have these. Valtrux pills. Okay. I'll read you  some of these notes from Santa's. Okay. Um, Amy, the word dyke is too harsh. Please change  it to something more acceptable, like lesbian. Like damn or. Like lesbian. Oh. You can't say  cunt. You can't say fuck. Um. We know that. We cannot see Amy actually jerking off the naked 
[00:53:00]  actor or any hand movement from behind. Why? It's not even hand movement. No. They can't show it  from behind. They can't show your elbow moving? No. But it's cable TV. No. This  one, a subtle blowjob gesture here may work. If it's too overly graphic, we won't be able  to show. My suggestion is to shoot a couple and send what you want, but also shoot a safety.  For the blowjobs. Safety. Safety. Never shoot the safety. For the blowjobs. Plural. What  a great show this is going to be. We can see the heads go down off camera, but we cannot see 
[00:53:30]  anything. This is my favorite. Also, not sure what a chuck on the tits is, but we should  avoid this, please. Avoid chuck on the tits. Chuck on the tits. What is that? I think that  was in season one of Happy Days. Sounds like coming on the tits. It will need to be, I eat  pussies for breakfast or we will have to bleep pussy or context. I just wish they would let  you guys do your fucking thing. By the way, here's the example. Because this has nothing 
[00:54:00]  to do with cable TV. Louis, this is why Louis works. A Network said, okay, here's a couple  of things you can't say. You do what you do as a funny person and give it to us and we  will stay the fuck out of it. And what you get is the most Emmy nominations that a guy  has ever gotten. Louis. Hilarious, right? It's legendary because Louis said, I'll do a show  for you, but you're not going to be able to see it. I will hand it in to you. And if  that's acceptable with you, then we got a deal. But that's what happens when networks 
[00:54:30]  leave you alone. But I mean, Comedy Central's a lot better than a regular network. Comedy  Central's been very cool, but standards and practices, and even they've been more lenient  than my first experience with them. Okay, good. But yeah, but those emails just made me  like that. Do you feel like you're able to work around this stuff? I don't know. I mean,  we'll have to, but some of the stuff like... Because some of the stuff in your head, you  just know, oh my God, this is what will be funny. I just know it in my bones. Yeah. And 
[00:55:00]  to end, I think some of it won't work if taken out. Like that scene, or like the scene where  the chuck on her tits, that, I think that was the scene. I just, we wrote about like how  when actresses go on late night shows, they're so like precious. And the dynamic of like them  and the host is always like, oh, like, it's like, I have a crush on you. No, I have  crush on you. It's just so awkward. And like the girl's supposed to be like this unbelievably  hot, whatever. And the audience, if the girl's always like, and I'm a nerd, I was a nerd.  And like, I love, I loved Star Wars. And the guys in the crowd are just like, who started 
[00:55:30]  we? Just like jerking off. And so it just ends with like the crowd just like, like throwing  their like, uh, spooge all over this actress.  That's funny. That's hilarious. So what's the problem? Yeah, come on.  So we'll see what we're allowed to do with that. And then, but then after like we see  her get hit with all this cum, they're like, um, they're like, oh, it's yogurt. It's Dan  and yogurt day. And like, it's, we try to make it like they just, there was yogurt under 
[00:56:00]  everyone's seat. Like it was a promotion or something? Yeah, Dan and yogurt. That's funny.  That's fucking funny, man. Come on. You find out it was yogurt. And you can show the blowjob  by the way. Uh, can you use a shadow? A bobbing head shadow. Wait, but what, what is going  to be shown in that scene now? What, what parts do they take out? I think they don't want  to see me get showered with a cum. Who doesn't want to see that? But even though the reveal  I'm like, you haven't seen it. Okay. But even though the reveal is it's yogurt. Well, we'll  see. We're fighting back on that one. So we can fight back on some of these notes. I think 
[00:56:30]  it's better if you think it's yogurt. And then at the end, it turns out it's cum. Yeah.  Yeah. That's what you should write. Here's what you do. You write it as saying, everyone  thinks you're eating yogurt. Then it turns out it's cum. And they're like, no way. How  about this? They think it's cum, but it's yogurt. All right. That we can do. Okay. That's  fine. Yeah. Go over the top just so you can give them something back. That might actually  work. Yeah. Isn't that sad? You got to go over the top. This way it looks like they're  winning on certain battles. Yeah. Yeah. We'll see. I'm going to fight for that. I'm going to fight 
[00:57:00]  for that. This is the worst of Opie and Anthony. Sirius XM.  Hear every pitch of the 2013 baseball season with the Sirius XM app. The Giants have won  the World Series.

It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Ty, you've been going all over the country.  I have.  This guy's been all over the place now. He's a director.  Really?  Bobby, yes.  That's great. That's fantastic.  He's got a movie out called The Innkeepers. It's very scary. Very, also very clever. 
[01:01:30]  Very funny.  Really? It's a funny comedy.  I enjoyed the shit out of it. It's a horror film more than a comedy.  Yeah, yeah. It's scary. And tonight, this is fucking like crazy. This is crazy.  So we filmed the movie in Torrington, Connecticut. And we filmed it at a hotel called The Yankee  Peddler. It's a real hotel. And it's supposed to be haunted. And so I made this sort of ghost  story about this haunted hotel, but I just set it in a real haunted hotel and we made it  there. And so tonight, the town wanted to have a premiere for the movie because they're  in the middle of nowhere and they don't really get an indie movie up in Torrington, Connecticut. 
[01:02:00]  Now it's like this whole craze in the town. So they flew us in and we're going back up  for this premiere there tonight. And so we're going to go see the movie in this old theater  with 1,700 people. And then when it's over, we walk across the street to the actual hotel  where we shot the movie and have a party. But we didn't really change the hotel very  much. So it's going to be like you watch the movie and then you walk across the street  and you're in the movie. You're in the same hotel. And like the people who work there  wear the same clothes as they do in the movie. And it's just, it's going to be very surreal. 
[01:02:30]  That's crazy. And I'm staying there. You're going. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going. Now I'm, I'm  a little, I'm a, I'm a pussy. I'm kind of frightened to stay in this hotel because  it's known to be a haunted hotel. I just hope something happens. No. How great would that  be for your fucking movie to go over there? Now this is what happens. You have the premiere  success. Go over there. Something, Hey, he gets possessed, flies across the room, something  happens. And then that's part two, man. I know. I get an extra day of plugs on the  radio. Part two of the movie right now. And now, now does this hotel have TVs in the 
[01:03:00]  rooms? Yeah. Yeah. You'll be okay. It's a normal hotel. It's just a little bit. Well,  the funny thing is the owner was like, now the peddler has seen better days. And it's  like, how far could it have dropped off since we left? It wasn't so good when we were there  the first time. Um, but, uh, yeah, the Yankee peddler and what ghosts are supposed to be  there? Well, they have a ghost called Miss Connelly and I don't know the whole story,  but there's a chair in the lobby that it's like Miss Connelly's chair and you're not  supposed to sit in it. And, uh, that was a real story then from the movie? Well, the 
[01:03:30]  movie, our story is different, but when you're there, they have their own story. And I hope  that like the real Luke is there. I can't imagine him not being, I don't know where he'd  be. Um, there's a guy at the front desk named Luke who has a ghost hunting website.  And so one of the characters in my movie is sort of, it's not really based on him  because there's nothing like him, but there is a character with a ghost hunting website  and I named him that stuff. It gets me. It's very creepy. That's the shit that I think  about when I'm trying to go to sleep and it's dark and, and I'm like, I got to turn  the TV on because I'm thinking that I'm going to open my eyes and this fucker is going to  be like an inch away from my face. You know, what always stuck with me is when they say, 
[01:04:00]  if you let Satan in, if you say, come in, I allow you in, it can, he can. And that's  what's holding, like, you know, you hear that? Oh, that's it. So sometimes when I, when I see  a horror movie after it, I get so scared and I have to fight because in my, my brain's  like, let, you can come in. Oh, like if you let the, if you let the ghosts, like, let  the ghosts come in. I allow you to be here. Like, I want to say that. And you have trouble  keeping from saying that. You got to be casual. Call him Dev. Have you ever had, is that 
[01:04:30]  why you're into it? Or are you just, no, I don't believe in ghosts. I mean, this is the  closest I've ever come. Really? Staying at that place. Uh, you know, it was, it's not  a scary place. So I think you'll be okay staying there. It's just, it's a kooky place  though. And I know the whole place is, the whole town is obsessed. All they talk about  is it being haunted. And, um, you know, I had, I've seen doors open and closed by themselves.  Really? But I don't know if that's ghosts. What are you talking about? In front of grocery  stores. You ever be in your house and you open one door and the other one closes? Nope. 
[01:05:00]  I have. Come on, Bobby. Never happened. No. You ever have, uh, bacon chips? What's  that? I know. Goddamn shit. Um, you've never, so you've never had, uh, an apparition? I've  never seen a ghost. Heard something? Did you ever do any, like, recordings? Um, we did  a little bit of that. I've seen, like I said, doors. I was, my TV would turn off and on  by itself. Um, my phone would ring in my room and no one would be on the other line. That  never freaked you out? Uh, a little bit, but I was making a movie, so I was too stressed  to be freaked out. That was me, actually. I was just calling to see what's up.  I have AT&T, so it fucking died out of my head. I couldn't hear you. I got a tweet 
[01:05:30]  from somebody that said, uh, Ant's going to be possessed by a liberal. His head's going  to spin as he does philanthropic deeds. No! No! I would love to be able to write that  tweet. I just, I think philanthropic and then I'd have to go, ugh, what's another word?  You think, yeah, you think should I write Philip? How can you agree? I know Phil, but I'm  not, I don't know who thropic is. Your voice sounds stupid when you do that. Do you know  that? I love it. I did a, I did a, uh, I've stayed in Creepy. I love those hotels. I love, 
[01:06:00]  there's one in Salem. Uh, I stayed with Patrice. Me and him both did a college. I forget what  it was called. It's one of those Salem hotels. The irony of the two most uneducated guys in  comedy doing a college together. Patrice? You didn't go out to college? Yeah, he did.  No, he didn't. He played football for college. Oh, fuck. You fucking dumb. Yeah, he did.  All right, well, you're both of them then. I went to college too, stupid. No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did. I went to fine arts, dummy. You didn't go to fine arts. Yeah, I graduated 
[01:06:30]  fine arts, associate's degree. You're the only dummy. You can't even say it. He meant he went  to college too. Stupid. See, there's a comma. I, uh, see, he's, all right. Nice talking  to you. All right. I, uh, I love those old fucking haunted hotels. I can smell ghosts.  All right. Smells like old people farts. Well, the hotel smells like that, so maybe  you're right. Does it? Yeah. Like musty. It's a musty place for sure. That oldie, oldie  smell to it. I always thought it wasn't that clean. I did a college once where they had 
[01:07:00]  one of these old, uh, buildings from the fucking 1600s or 18, whatever the fuck it was. 1800s,  whatever. It's 200 years difference, whatever. I know, 1800s. Um, it was 18-something. Industrial  revolution. I know. One was the witches. Um, we, uh, I, uh, I was, I'm in the, I'm in  the hotel. It's old place, all antique furniture. I'm sitting there. I'm like, fucking this place  is creeping me out. I could smell that musty smell. I hear somebody upstairs walking. I'm  like, oh fuck, I'm sharing this shit fucking place with somebody. And the girl comes to 
[01:07:30]  pick me up. I go, who's, who's staying here? Is the other act staying here? She goes, no,  just you. There's nobody else in there. I was like, somebody's upstairs. She goes, oh,  it's haunted. Yeah. Sometimes I'm like, I'm out. I'm out. I go, go in and grab my bag.  It's in the living room. I'm not coming back here. I'm out. I'm not fucking staying there.  I had that in Vegas. Um, I was working with dice at the old, what was the hotel that they  horseshoe, not the horseshoe casino ranch. No lovers lane. Wayne Newton used to be there 
[01:08:00]  all the way. Newton in desert in no circus circus. Oh,  delay. I'm looking. Kenny. The Mirage. No. Paris. The Stardust. Palms. Stardust. Yeah,  the Stardust. It was in the Stardust. All right, Kelly. Dice had a house out there, so  I got to stay in his suite with, uh, they gave him a giant suite in the building next to  the hotel. It's a small high rollers building. There was, and there'd been murders there,  like mob hits and stuff like that. I heard in this place. And, uh, Kenny and happy face 
[01:08:30]  went out with Andrew. I was really sick. Um, I was, I had like the flu or something. So  I stayed in the room. I'm getting a hooker. And there was, I'm sorry. And there was a  pool table. That's what you say when you're sick guys. I'm not going out. I don't feel  good. Okay. So I was, uh, I was in bed and I could hear the pool balls knocking around  upstairs and I'm like, Oh fucking, uh, Kenny and happy must be back. They're playing. I could  hear the balls rolling across the table and hitting each other. And, uh, and I just got  really, really frightened. And, uh, I went up and I looked and I was alone. It's the 
[01:09:00]  only experience that I've ever had, but it was very, very fucking frightening. And you  saw spooks or something. Spooks. That's what you should be afraid of. Yeah. That was scary.  You've, that was funny. You felt scared before you went up there though. You felt, I just knew  something was wrong. Wait a minute. Am I alone? Are they not here? It just, it just  hit me that I might be okay. I was waking up and I heard. Yeah. It's a weird feeling 
[01:09:30]  because the same thing at this hotel, like I've seen those little things happen, but  it's not enough to know it's a ghost, but it is unsettling. Yeah. Yeah. It's just on  that boundary of like, well, it could be something, but eh. I talked loud, talking  loud. What are there ghosts here? What are you fucking ghosts? Leave me alone. And the  ghosts, you tried to scare, you scared the ghosts? No, but it, it just takes, it's, it's,  it's a time where you think you're supposed to be quiet and creepy. So when you're louder, 
[01:10:00]  it feels like it takes you out of it. Hey, what is this? A ghost? Ah, right, right. Make  it all silly. You know, seeing a ghost be not, I mean, I see why it's scary because I'm  scared of it also, but shouldn't it theoretically just be kind of awesome? Like, wouldn't it  be? It should be, but it's so scary. Like, like it, first of all, it, it's  it confirms like what happens after death. Hi, that might freak out a little bit. And  then it's like, eh, you've always been conditioned to think these things are like fucked up and 
[01:10:30]  are there to fuck with you. Somebody once called into, I did that Saturday night show  where we talked about ghosts one night and the guy called in and he made so much sense.  He goes, so you believe when you die, you turn into a ghost. That's what ghosts are. Dead  people. I go, yeah. He goes, yeah, well there'd be ghost traffic if that was a case because,  because there'd be so many ghosts. And I'm like, yeah, why is there only like one ghost  in each state? Like one, there'd be fucking ghosts right here, right now. I was wondering  about, I wondered about ghost clothes. Like they're always like, there she was wearing 
[01:11:00]  this silk gown and stuff. It's like, what do the clothes turn into a ghost? Well, you  know, what's funny too, is they never have a ghost from the eighties, like a black guy  and roller skates. It's, you know, with a, with a, with a headband, you know, just doing  some disco moves in the corner. I like to not laugh. I want a boogie roller skates. I'm  a disco ride. Oh yeah. It wouldn't like graveyards be like concerts then. It would  they just be packed. Yeah. And it's like a haunted mansion in Disney. It's always old  people from like old white people with white, like freaky old clothes. It's never, sometimes 
[01:11:30]  voodoo movies have black people. That's the only time you get a black ghost is if there's  voodoo involved or a zombie. Yeah. Santa Maria. Santa Maria. Right. Yeah. It's usually crotchety  old white people. There's no Indian ghosts. You never, there's spirits. It's like the extension  of get off my lawn. It's now. Yeah. Yeah. You had a good take on, uh, on the whole, um, ghost  hunters and, and how like with all these shows on, we should see something. Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  And yet they've never shown any. Well, in a, in a similar story, when I just flew in  yesterday, I was on JetBlue and I was watching a thing about Bigfoot and it was like, this  is the documentary that's going to prove that's it. And I was like, if it proved there was  Bigfoot, I would just know, you'd know already before it aired. I would have found out from  somebody not this direct TV on JetBlue. And it goes on and on and they tease it and tease  it and ultimately they have no answers. Yeah. I think that's interesting about the ghost  hunting shows is that there's four of them on TV, excuse me, and they all are really  successful and they all fail every week. Yeah. And it's just like, well, one of them 
[01:12:30]  doesn't. It shows a failure every week. One of them doesn't. No, wait, one of them  ghost, ghost adventures, I think on a travel channel. Yeah. No, it actually is the, it's  the best one because these, because most of these guys, these ghost shows have a huge  camera crew with them. Okay. So how creepy can you get with a sound guy and two camera  guys with lights? These guys go in no crew, just those three. They do all the filming with 
[01:13:00]  just handheld cameras in the dark with night vision camera and they get locked in for the  night. It's not like they, like most of these shows, they go to three in the morning and  then they go, all right, let's wrap it up because they're tired. So they don't want to  step all night. Ghosts might be camera shy. No. What I'm saying is, is that, um, these guys  are in, in the dark, complete darkness and they've, they, it's just them. There's no camera  crew. Uh, and they get locked in for the night until the sun comes up and they, is  that what ends the night? They've caught, not in Alaska, stupid fuckhead. I, uh, I'm 
[01:13:30]  sorry. That came out too mean. Sorry. Clever point about your, I call stressing for the  night. I call not till midnight, not till three for the night until the sun comes up  in case you don't know what the night, when it ends, I call them a fucking, I told you,  I called you a fucking idiot. So I feel bad. I was, I'm not offended. All right. Um, and  these guys actually caught, uh, a brick going across being thrown. I understand the urge 
[01:14:00]  to throw one for the night, dude. He's just mean. He's just attack mode all the time. He's  never, he's always on attack mode. Yeah, you are. You're just mean to the core. Have you  ever seen the, uh, that show Paranormal State? It's like the, the dudes. I watched that one  too. Yeah. It's. Well, I got content on Twitter by that guy, Chip Coffey. What's that? I know.  Oh God. This is the, listen, here's the thing though. I just want you to, before you said 
[01:14:30]  this, Chip Coffey, they always have the psychic guy and they're always gay. Oh really? It's  always a gay psychic. Like Chip Coffey, he walks in, he's like, oh, oh fuck. Oh no.  Chip Coffey's the best. He's like, there's some evil shit in here. So I have is like,  I have his home phone now. I'm hoping to like get a reading with Chip Coffey. Wow.  Chip Coffey is fucking hilarious. But then they have the other chick, the lesbian girl.  Yeah. Very serious. Flat faced. Yeah. Less interested in her. Yeah. Chip comes in with 
[01:15:00]  a scarf, comes in with a scarf, throws it back. Fashionable, huh? I feel something's up,  something's upstairs and it's fucking hating everybody here. Yeah. He's very sassy about his,  his spiritual reality. It's so funny though. I've not seen that. He does prayers, like religious  prayers. Does he? I've noticed him do that. Yeah. Like Catholic prayers. Well, I did  an interview in our sort of press tour with a guy who writes for a paranormal, I don't  know, website or something. And I was talking about Chip Coffey and he was like, Chip's a  very good friend of mine. And I was like, oh, hook it up. And next thing you know, now on 
[01:15:30]  Twitter. And so I hope to, uh, I had a friend who did a reading with him on her birthday.  Her like boyfriend got it for her. And, uh, everything he said came true.  That's weird. Chip, Chip is, uh, Chip is, I fucking hate it. I just, I wish his name  wasn't Chip. Can we call him Bob? Uh, he's good. But the ghost adventure guys, but this  guy, the one, the reason why I like those guys, he's a big muscle, macho alpha male  guy. And he walks out in the middle of the room and he goes, you come on, let's go. 
[01:16:00]  Let's, you want to attack somebody, attack me. In the coast hunters, you're not supposed  to provoke. That's against the rules. Is it? Yeah. Well, most ghosts, you don't  provoke. Who makes these rules up? And they always run out of shit to say too, when  they provoke talking to the ghost. If you're here, could you tap on something?  It's like when a chick tells you to talk dirty and you just run out of shit. Yeah.  Yeah. You fucking like that, don't you? Yeah. You like that fucking shit.  Fucking you. Yeah. You like me fucking you. Plow my cock in. Like that. Yeah. You run out of shit. 
[01:16:30]  And back in again, ad infinitum. I think I'll give tonight as the last day that I make an  attempt to believe in ghosts. So if you come back and you say there's ghosts, I'll believe.  I hope he doesn't come back. Shut up! Hang on. A big moment is that Patrice joke that he  used to have where he would say, like, why are they always doing, like, hack movie ghost  things? Yeah, yeah, true. I was like, I now can't get that out of my head. It makes total  sense. Yes. Why aren't ghosts doing, like, regular just, like, shit? They always creep behind 
[01:17:00]  the door. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They're always like, you turn and look and nothing's there  and then you turn and look in the mirror and they're there. It's like, come on, you  fucking hack. Why doesn't the ghost fucking just come out and start, like, fucking doing  the music from Escape from New York that Ernest Borgnheim was listening to? Like, are you  here? That song? That would be very original. They never, like, open the bathroom door and  it's just like, get out. I'm on the shitter. It's never that. You never see a ghost drop in a 
[01:17:30]  deuce. Never. What was the movie where the Barbara Hershey got sexually, her tit being  mushed by a ghost? Yeah, she's just getting raped by a ghost. That's what ghosts should  be doing. Ghost rape was fucking, I mean, I was sitting there going, why am I being turned  up by ghost rape? When you watch that movie, about 20 minutes in, you realize, like, oof,  this is going to keep happening because there's nothing anyone can do about it. So she gets  thrown around the room and raped and then you're like, they're just going to keep doing it.  No one's going to stop them. And they can just sit there and watch the investigation 
[01:18:00]  like, they have no idea, I'm right here. Cops come in, you're like, ah, and they run  out. I would love to be a ghost rapist. It would fucking rule. Somehow I think that's  how you're going to end up anyway. All I would do is just rape chicks. Right. It does seem  like there would be some great things to do. Norton has the body of Casper. Yeah, well,  you got the eyes. It just sucks. It just stinks. Chip ruins everything. Even when you get  a good one and you can't just laugh because Chip will come in and just smash it. It just 
[01:18:30]  stinks. I was listening the other day. I'm glad that Valley Jimmy has not taken off.  That is, I think, officially the worst one. What the fuck is that? Yeah, I didn't like  Valley Jimmy at all. What is Valley Jimmy? But he kept doing it. It's Valley Jimmy. It's  Jimmy doing old fucking shtick from Valley Girl. He doesn't like to be gagged with utensils.  It's so fucking annoyingly bad. I hope what happens to you, Anthony, I hope that you go there.  Well, I do too. And you meet a ghost. Yeah. An older woman ghost. Yeah. That's mad at 
[01:19:00]  you because you're sleeping with younger, you have a younger girl on the bed. Why would  the ghost give a shit? I hope you get raped by an old lady ghost. Why would the ghost  care? And why wouldn't the ghost just make herself young? Why do you have to be a certain  age as a ghost? That's stupid. When you die, that's what you are as a ghost. Not in Titanic,  motherfucker. What are you talking about? She fucking died, the old broad, and then she  went down to the Titanic, and there was Leonardo DiCaprio waiting for the main stairway. And 
[01:19:30]  they were both all young. Did she die in Titanic? Yeah. What do you think? She jumped off the  boat at the end? No. I don't know. She just kind of threw... She threw that diamond up the  other guy. That's right. She threw the thing in. Fucking stupid twat. Then she went back  to sleep, and she fucking... She just dreamed that she was in a boat. Fucking some... Some millionaire  takes her on a trip, and she fucks a guy who is hitching a ride. I fucking had forgotten  about that. I have to see him 3D when it comes out now. If you're in your room at night,  and all of a sudden, the light goes off, what would you do? Well, did someone turn 
[01:20:00]  it off? No, it just goes off. What are you going to do? Do you mean starts yelling and  talking shit? The bulb. I would assume the bulb burnt out. Blew a fuse. Hang on one second.  What did you say, Jim? I was wondering if when you said the light goes off, do you mean that  it was just talking a lot of shit, like bashing you? Oh, God. At least use the chip voice if  you're going to lay down humor such as that. Nudge yourself, stupid. I would probably get  startled for a second, but that wouldn't be like one of those ghostly moments where I  would freak out. What if you heard somebody whisper in your ear? Are you in my bed? Is 
[01:20:30]  it a real person, or there's no one there? Do you know how many times you've heard that  from bed? Instead of bed, they say crib. Shit, man. I have no doubt that tonight.  No, he's on fire today. He's on fire. The town has certainly seen better days, so I have  no doubt that the fact there's going to be all these people in a one block radius, everyone  who has some scam is going to be out tonight. So I'm very curious to see. Oh, that's pretty  cool. How everyone's going to be trying to make a few bucks. Yeah. Get your ghost pictures 
[01:21:00]  here. Get your ghost pictures. Get your amulets to protect you from the hauntings. I'm going  to buy one. Here's your elixirs. Drink your elixir before you see the haunted movie. Yeah.  I saw a ghost. There's one guy telling ghost stories. No, it'll give a fuck. Holy water.  I get your holy water. Yeah. You think? Just to praise some fat. I have holy water and crucifixes.  The guy like in the business next door trying to alert like the real ghosts are over here.  Don't listen to that shit. Trying to draw the business away from the peddler. All hotels 
[01:21:30]  say they're haunted, but this is, you know, a haunted dry cleaner. That's like crazy.  Do you know where the most haunted is? Yes. How do you say that? I do. Most haunted.  Haunted. There are. There's two spots. One of which is when in my movie, the most haunted  room in the story is the honeymoon suite. And it just is because it's about a woman who killed  herself on her wedding day. And we shot it in this room only because... Was her name Bonnie? 
[01:22:00]  I only picked the room because it was on the third floor at the end of a hallway and it was  big enough to do a dolly shot. So it was just technical reasons so I could, you know, film it  the way I wanted to. And then when we wrapped shooting, I found out that that room is actually  the most haunted room in the hotel. Really? So it's a coincidence that I picked that room.  But when you add all those other things up, like the doors and whatever, it's, you know,  it's weird. And then they say the basement is, is, is pretty haunted. Would you stay in  the basement? No. That's what you want to do. Why don't you go in the basement? I'll walk  down there. You should stay in the basement. Other people go. You should stay in the fucking 
[01:22:30]  basement. No, why would I do that? This is what you do. You go to the basement, have everybody  leave until dawn. Hang out there for a couple of... Until dawn, when the sun comes up. Hang  up there for a couple of... The whole night. Film it. The night. The night. You stay for the night,  dude. Well, I got that. You should film it. My iPhone. From the dusk. Take through the night.  You come down, find you drinking, throwing bricks everywhere. Yeah, the ghosts are all hanging out,  fucking dropping N-bombs. These are all from the 1800s. What do you mean they let those people  vote now, Anthony? He's like, I know! Are you saying I would have a good time hanging out with 
[01:23:00]  those ghosts? Yeah, the ghosts from the 1800s would tell you you're too conservative. Dude,  you gotta lighten up a little bit. You think we're scary? A little heavy-handed, aren't  you, Tony? I think with all the cameras that everybody has, it's like UFOs, you know? All  the cameras. You'd get UFOs and ghosts and Bigfoot if they existed. But they have some...  I mean, I've seen some stuff on YouTube. I'm not saying I don't know what the fuck it 
[01:23:30]  is, but there's some stuff on YouTube that you're like, whoa, that's fucking... That's  pretty weird. How about definitive proof of a ghost, not a fucking lens flare or something?  I've seen some creepy shit on, I mean, that show Ghost Adventures. I mean, there's a brick  flies across the room and a piece of wood, but it goes up and over. It's not like it's  falling down, which you could be, oh, that fell off or something. It gets up and over,  which is... Almost like it was on a string. Yeah, almost. 
[01:24:00]  They had it on the news then. They had... They found ghosts throwing bricks. All of a sudden,  where were they? We had Watts in 1968. They were on the news. It was on the local news  for the show. All of them were hitting Reginald Denny's head. Yeah. It was a ghost that threw  a toilet at a trucker. You guys didn't mock his doors on the get-off. Go ahead, mock the  ghosts. I'm not mocking the ghosts. You are mocking the ghosts. No, I'm not. Ghosts are  cunts. Anthony is mocking the ghosts. Also, watching that Bigfoot show, like the famous Bigfoot  footage, I don't like how he just saunters away. Like, there's two guys with guns on horses 
[01:24:30]  that are humans to this giant creature, and it's just like... And it has that swagger  to its wall. Yeah, that little swagger. He walks away. And, yeah, it's like back in  the 70s. They would have shot him. They would have shot him, those old fucking codgers.  And ate him. I was watching a series of them on the History Channel. It was that, and  there was Champ. They would have sold his pelt. Oh, yeah. This is like the Loctis monster  of Lake Champlain. Yeah, that's not true. Nessie is not real, although there's been some  amazing, but the surgeon's photo, which was the most famous photo of Nessie, was he 
[01:25:00]  sat on his deathbed was a hoax, and he said how he did it. Yeah, when you get a bunch  of... It was his cock, right? No. He was on his back. He bent his dick. A weird piece  of wood that was upside down. It was something that just looked... The shadow of it looked...  Look up Nessie. What is it? Surgeon's photo. What is it? Nessie. Nessie. Was that taken  out in the day or the night? Yeah, it was at dusk, probably. Or it was black and white.  It's hard to tell. What's weird, though, is there's not much difference between, like, if Nessie  was real and, like, a crocodile? Like, if you had never seen a crocodile before, it'd 
[01:25:30]  be the craziest monster you'd ever seen. It'd be a monster. Right. We just got used  to it, so... They're dinosaurs. But, I mean, I'm sure somewhere in, like, the Congo or the  Amazon, like, way in there where no one can go, there's got to be some weird things that  we don't know about. Yeah. Like, you actually walk into a piano bar in Scotland and you see  the Loch Ness Monster, but everybody there is just used to it. He's just... Why would he be  in a piano bar? That's the odd part, and he's just dumping water on himself because  he hates being dry. The waitresses hate him. His area is always sloppy and wet. Warm  water, yeah. He doesn't tip because he has no pockets. He's just a monster. I think with 
[01:26:00]  all the cameras that everybody has now... Now, years ago, we got a bunch of UFO photos, and  the odds that you were going to see one and have a camera on you were astronomical. And  they still found places where there were these UFOs. Now, anything that happens of  any significance, there's fucking video of it somewhere. But there are stuff... How  come there's no UFOs? There is some fucking clusters and weird stuff I've seen. Oh, those  fucking pin lights that no one could see what they are. No, there are some of them that 
[01:26:30]  do move in a weird... When they report it from a bunch of different areas at once, then I  tend to have... I'm sure that the UFO we do, they're not going to have the Jetson sound.  I'm going to go... I want to see that. I want to see a whole fucking... Was that Steve's  Prius? Yeah, that's right. When pilots report them, I find them more credible. Yeah, pilots...  Yes. They have an entire series. They have one in a volcano. This volcano erupted, and  they have a photo of a ship inside of the blast. Inside of the blast, like lights. And it's 
[01:27:00]  like, what the fuck? You know, it's... Where's this photo? It's on the internet. Did you  Google it? You're lying. I swear to God, it was just on... They did a whole show on it,  UFOs, and it was... Yeah, that fucking creeps me out. You see... I mean, volcanoes erupting,  and there's actually lights inside of the volcano, like a ship. The craziest thing is Betty and  Barney Hill. I said ship, not ship. Betty and Barney Hill is probably one of the most outrageous  fucking things that ever happened. Fucking black and white couple back in the 60s. It's crazy. 
[01:27:30]  interracial couple that was taken aboard of how they lost some time. Oh, they were?  Oh, they were?  A ship. And they said that they... They were a fairly believable case, because they came  out of hypnosis. Both of them, I think, had to be hypnotized. And she was describing a needle  in the stomach test that they were giving her. And they said that... Maybe his dick had hurt  her lower abdomen. And she said it was a... They said that we're checking to see if you're 
[01:28:00]  pregnant. But it was a pregnancy test that wasn't done. Oh. Medicine hadn't invented that  yet. So again, it may be nothing. I don't know. Probably bullshit. I just... Was her father  making sure there weren't any problems? It was probably Betty and Barney Hill probably just  hiding from fucking... Oh, look at that. From life. What is that? Oh, my God. What was  the guy's name that they made that Fire in the Sky movie about? Oh, right, yeah.  Travis. Wait. No. Dr. Gay? No, not... Dr. Gay! Oh, my God. Is it... Let me say. Walton? 
[01:28:30]  Travis Walton? Travis Walton. All right. Thank you, Tostito. Travis Bickle. Shut up. By  the way, that's just a fucking flare on the camera lens, Bob. I'm looking at that terrible  video. Who put it out, J.J. Abrams? It really isn't. There's nothing UFO-ish about it. Are  you reading the comments? He loves a lens flare. That's not it. As he was saying,  that he was doing the exact same motions in the video. Oh, wow. That's ghostly.  It was. It was a haunted connection there. Holy shit. I don't like ghosts. What if you 
[01:29:00]  looked on here and it was actually me? And I was a ghost? We'd be much happier.  You would don't mean that, dude. Oh. Yeah. That's just terrible. Wish Bob was a ghost.  Why is he waving to the ghost? Dude, what's wrong? Why would you say that? This could be fun  to see you trying to haunt the place. Then we're going, shut up. Whoa, whoa, dude.  How would I? Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. No, it would be like this. Boom. Dude. You know what, dude?  Dude. Yeah. Dude. Boom. You got your afterlife. You got your haunting. Boom, dude. Dude. I saw a ghost. 
[01:29:30]  His leg was broken. He was bitching about it. Dude. The ITV's coming out. I'm missing it. I walked  to a wall, dude. Dude, the ITV. I snapped my misty knee, dude. My misty knee? Yeah. I hope  you get possessed by a black ghost tonight. Look at you. Oh, like you did when you were  a kid. Yeah. Only it wasn't a ghost. Yeah, it was a gardener. Someone's planting a gardener  on the dead ghost you shot. My family was a millionaire? No. I don't think your family was 
[01:30:00]  a millionaire. I just think your gardener raped your asshole. I didn't say he was employed  by your family. He probably just wandered into your fucking broken screen door. Oh, shit.  How'd you know I had a broken screen door? Because you looked molestable, and everyone  who was molested had a broken screen door. Oh, really? That's true. Sure. I'll go through  raping you to fix it. I didn't know that. I didn't know that. I really hope you get fucking  possessed. I don't want to get possessed. It's gonna happen. I don't want to see a ghost.  I don't want to fucking... You do want to see a ghost. I want to party. It could be party. 
[01:30:30]  It's gonna be a party. It's gonna fucking be a party. It should be a good time. Ghosts don't like parties.  They do. They do like parties. It scares them away like fish. They do like them. And then later,  this is what's gonna happen. When it's all said and done, you go back to your room.  Late at night before the sun comes up, you dummy. Right? Late at night, you're gonna be  in your bed by yourself. For the night. And that's... I like it. Stay for the night.  And that's when it's gonna happen. Yeah. I don't think the ghost shows up at dawn  just to prove the theory wrong. Oh, yeah. Hey, Bobby.  4 p.m. ghost. That is... How come there's no ghosts at fucking... 
[01:31:00]  in the daytime? Ever? Oh. Yeah, ever.  In every movie, there's no ghost that attacks during the day.  Yeah, it wouldn't be as scary.  How come ghosts don't just show up where there's a lot of people?  Like, how come they never show up at a flash mob  and haunt, like, when someone's grabbing a Butterfingers?  Yeah. Some weird place?  Tokyo could be the most haunted place.  Yeah, they're all packed in.  Times Square, right. Ghosts in Times Square.  No. It's always some fucking half-abandoned house.  No one there. What a load of shit.  You know what's the scary movie was that one with John Cusack, who I don't like. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Room whatever. Oh, the ghost is making me...  14... 1408.  That was scary because then all of a sudden you can't leave the room.  Like, that was fucking horrifying.  The short story of that is actually really...  I wasn't a huge fan of the movie because it turns into the weird, like, the painting.  It just kind of goes overboard.  Yeah, yeah.  But the story, there's this thing that keeps happening where he keeps...  The phone keeps ringing and the person on the other line is just like,  Number nine. Number nine.  And then he hangs up and they just keep calling and counting down. 
[01:32:00]  And that's...  Oh, that's...  It's really creepy.  It's just some weird Stephen King stuff.  That's what people keep saying on the phone and they keep counting down numbers.  Yeah.  It's really creepy.  When you're reading it at home, you get really creepy.  Before it went overboard, that was a really creepy movie.  And I liked the initial exchange, too, between him and...  Who was running the hotel?  Samuel Jackson.  Samuel Jackson.  Yeah, that was funny.  I was in, what the fuck, Louisville.  And they put you in this old, old hotel.  Really.  They have Al Capone Room in this restaurant called the Oak Room. 
[01:32:30]  He had his own...  Did they think he'd come back when you walked in?  Well, they...  I want him dead.  I want his family dead.  And I went up to the 10th floor and they said that's where this lady in a blue dress jumped  in the elevator shaft killed herself because her husband or something happened.  Her husband got in a car accident and she was supposed to die.  He didn't die.  It was just a fuck up.  He actually just got hurt real bad. 
[01:33:00]  And then she just said, fuck it and killed herself.  I went up to the 10th floor by myself and I got fucking goose pimples.  Were you like all scared?  Yeah, but I don't know if that was my own...  Of course it was.  Yes, it was.  We know.  It was your own.  Of course it was.  What else is it?  What else is it?  Electricity.  They use electricity.  There was no ghost lady.  Ghost lady in a blue dress.  Ghost lady jumping in a blue dress.  I bet.  I hope you both get haunted.  No.  I'm making a laugh.  I'm so happy.  Ghosts are queers.  I don't want to get haunted. 
[01:33:30]  Ghosts.  You think that?  Oh, please let it happen.  A ghost wouldn't even have to change his form to possess him.  Yeah?  Maybe he'd fall in your mouth or something.  What?  Goddamn, Chip.  It's like, you know, you get a good one in and Chip's got to just step on it.  Damn, man.  He's a fucking party pooper.  Unbelievable.  And it's not Chip, by the way.  Who is it?  Peppy Sinclair.  Yeah, he's calling himself Peppy Sinclair now.  I refuse.  I don't even know where this fucking came from.  I refuse.  What a name.  This is more show busy. 
[01:34:00]  And Chip.  Strange name.  You got an agent.  That's Peppy Sinclair.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Judd.  Hey.  Mr. Apatow.  How are you doing?  How are you doing?  How are you, buddy?  It's been a while.  Nice to see you.  Bye, man.  Nice to see you.  Oh, man.  Promoting, of course.  Take a seat.  Promoting, of course, this is 40.  Yes, sir.  We open the day the world ends.  Yes.  The 21st, apparently, right?  This Friday. 
[01:34:30]  Isn't that when it all happens?  Is that going to affect the receipts, you think?  We don't know what time of day the world will end.  If it's late in the day, we get matinees in.  You can only hope.  And they haven't told us how we're going to die.  I don't know if we have that information.  Like, are we all going to burn up?  Or are souls going to hell?  Does anyone know, like, how we die?  I don't know.  Is it a global explosion, or is it something like, that might take a while?  I'm thinking an earthquake.  Big earthquake.  Yeah?  One of those uber earthquakes.  Are they swallowed up?  The Mayans are going to feel like such dicks on Saturday. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Nothing happens.  It's humiliating.  Dumb Mayans.  Can we find a Mayan?  That's the only reason we've talked about them for 500 years, is that we think they know  when the world's going to end.  We've got to find one and just yell at them.  Well, that's how we know we're old, which is how many times the world hasn't ended.  Yes.  There was the Nostradamus for a few years.  They had the movie.  And, you know, it just...  That guy scared the hell out of me growing up, though.  Oh, that movie was scary.  Without Twitter and stuff, like, how did they used to spread that around, though?  Because I remember growing up, it was like, the world's going to end at noon today. 
[01:35:30]  Like, how did that get around?  A Stanley Segal show.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Are you kidding?  I remember Stanley Segal.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Come on.  That's a deep reference, Stanley Segal.  That's a great reference.  Was he local, though?  Channel 9, I think.  He was kind of the first...  Well, he was around Donnie's time, but he was the first guy that went hardcore, like,  strange people.  He went all in.  Stanley Segal, I haven't thought of that name in decades.  Wow, I've never heard of him.  Yeah, he was a good watch. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, before they went hardcore, those shows were just like, you know, they would talk about  like gardening.  Yeah, and then Stanley Segal would have, like, you know, Renee Richards, the...  Ooh, yes, the transsexual.  Transsexual.  Oh, right.  Look at me, pretending I had to think of who that was.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, right.  I ball-boyed for her when I was a kid.  I was on vacation.  Ironic.  And how was she?  You know, it's funny.  I was ball-boying.  I was like, I don't know, they're like, we need ball boys for this women's tennis tournament. 
[01:36:30]  And so I ball-boyed, I don't know who it was, like Tracy Austin when she was like 15  years old.  But women, they don't hit it hard.  Or back then, there were those little wooden rackets.  So every time they hit back and forth, it took 50 minutes.  And I could see that the game was going to last a really long time, hours.  And so I just went to the judge guy, and I go, I got to go eat lunch.  And I left.  Which I don't think.  Commitment.  Yes.  Your film comes out Friday. 
[01:37:00]  I saw it.  Yes.  I liked it.  I'm very phlegmy right now.  Oh, it's too early.  It's the morning phlegm.  That one scene we were talking about, it's like, are you concerned when you have a film  come out?  Like, they canceled the premiere of Tom Cruise's movie.  Right.  Yes.  Well, can I explain?  Because I saw it.  Yeah.  Are you going to have problems with the Albert Brooks hose kiddie pool scene?  Well, this kind of stuff happens all the time.  There's a scene in the movie, you know, Albert Brooks has triplets. 
[01:37:30]  And so he's broke, and he says, you know, I'm going to have to, what do you want me to  do?  Because I can't afford him.  He's yelling at his son.  What do you want me to do?  You know, get rid of two of them?  Let's go play murder.  We'll pick the best one.  And so, you know, you shoot.  So, yeah.  So you shoot it, you know, a year and a half ago.  Right.  Anything could land on the week when something devastating happens.  I remember when Stiller did Zoolander, it was just filled with shots of the World Trade  Center.  Oh, right.  And, but he had a month or, you know, there's a few weeks before the movie came out. 
[01:38:00]  So he went and he digitally made adjustments.  Spider-Man 2, I think, had that, a shot of the Trade Center and they had to take it out.  It was.  But if you think deeply about almost any piece of entertainment, you can get to an interpretation  of any joke.  Right.  Because I did a bunch of talk shows this week and I'd be going through like my jokes with  the segment producer.  And they were like, oh, dude, you can't talk about that because that kind of seems like  it's about that a little bit.  Oh, really?  On things that are nowhere in the universe.  Like, well, you can't talk about your kids at all. 
[01:38:30]  Don't talk about your kids.  Jesus.  And so I understand it.  I think we all debate like what the line is.  I remember after 9-11, you know, you felt like Saturday Night Live was kind of soft for  a little while.  Like they didn't want to touch Bush, Cheney, because we had to support them because we're  going to go to war and we can't call them morons anymore.  And then suddenly they did a sketch and this is when I knew it was over.  The premise was that Cheney was basically in charge and Bush basically just blows him. 
[01:39:00]  And then it's over.  And it was like, okay, they've completely come back to something else.  So, yeah, it is weird.  And I, what can you do?  It's two days beforehand and it's a joke from a year and a half ago.  Yeah.  It was very uncomfortable in the theater, I'm not going to lie.  Oh, I'm sure.  But it doesn't take away from the movie.  But it was like, wow.  Yeah.  And I think in your head you're like, oh, that joke suddenly has a different context. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, unfortunately, you know, bad timing.  But what are you going to do?  And do you think of that when you, obviously, you know, you hear of a horrible thing like  this and it's not the first thing you think of, but do you, as the day goes by, go, holy  shit, we got that?  Like, eh.  Oh, absolutely.  No.  The second it happens, I'm like, oh, that joke's going to be weird.  Yeah.  But I've seen it happen so many times and it's happened to us so many times.  And I have to say, I kind of avoid in all my work things that I think, like, people will 
[01:40:00]  go like, oh, I feel bad because someone in my family died in a plane crash.  Or, like, there's a certain type of joke I avoid on purpose, which I might even, you know,  be way too sensitive.  Like, yeah, but someone went through that, so I don't want to give up on that.  But, you know, the point of making jokes is to make us feel better and to pop the tension  about how shocked we are that the world makes no sense.  So what are we going to do?  Not talk about things.  Yeah.  So it's tricky. 
[01:40:30]  What do you guys do?  You guys have to talk about it for three hours every day.  Four hours a day.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you try to work your way through it, I guess.  Yeah.  You try to do the right thing at the moment, you know.  Yeah, we've been railing the fucking news pretty much on this one because they're talking  about every other thing that might be responsible for this, but they're not talking about the  fact that they're pretty much making a comic book superhero villain out of these killers.  And, you know, if you're going to cash in your chips, what's that? 
[01:41:00]  If you're going to kill yourself and go out in a blaze of glory, what better way to do  it than get on the news and be an anti-hero?  They should at least add it to the discussion.  Well, I think that's â€“ I couldn't agree with that more.  When Columbine happened, I was immediately disgusted with how it becomes this â€“ it's  a story that you could make hundreds of episodes of entertainment news out of. 
[01:41:30]  Yes.  And so they have â€“ okay, we've got visuals and we have interviews with the survivors  and the parents and the experts.  And so for months on Columbine, they were repackaging it.  And, you know, those shows, they're paid for by advertisers.  It's no different than an episode of Law & Order to a television network.  So on some level, they're thrilled to have something that people are really interested  in.  Yeah, bringing in the viewers.  Yeah.  And if you're nuts and you see something a billion times, you're like, well, what are  my options in my misery right now?  Yeah.  I do believe that it gets in people's head and in the 1800s, you know â€“ I mean, I also 
[01:42:00]  agree you shouldn't be able to get certain weapons that kind of make it way easier.  But I think there's â€“ I don't know what you could do culturally.  You can't stop the idea that there's going to be so much entertainment news about this.  Yeah.  But it becomes a talking point.  Like what it really is is like â€“ but we said the other day both sides use it to strengthen  their argument, that that event, an anti-gun crusader and an NRA member can both use that 
[01:42:30]  event as an amazing jumping off point to strengthen their argument, the exact same event.  So that's all it is.  It's just the thing in the middle of the room that everybody's pointing at and discussing  and it just â€“ it loses any emotional impact completely.  You just don't â€“  I kind of disagree with that.  Yes, go.  I was just going to say that.  David, tell it.  This is so emotional that this is why they're having this discussion and the NRA are on their  heels.  No, no.  I mean the media.  I'm not talking about the NRA.  The media themselves, not the press.  But I think Jada said it, which is like they can say it ad nausea like when they â€“ like 
[01:43:00]  I think it's inappropriate to show funerals.  I think that the people should have their space and that the news should â€“ I think they're  trying to be as respectful as possible, but they're not.  And that that is crossing a line.  Like if you were a comic on stage and you said something and you'd be like, okay, I  know I just took it too far and the crowd's groaning, then you would know like, okay,  crossing a line.  In my mind, I'm watching this.  I want the news.  I want the story.  But I don't want to see that. 
[01:43:30]  I know that as a person who's lost people, that's their moment.  But they're not being â€“ they're not even trying to â€“  It's not helping them.  They're not even trying to be respectful.  They're trying to get as close as they can without sparking a stampede.  Like they don't â€“ if they cared about being respectful, they wouldn't ask kids.  Fucking Dr. Phil.  I know that's â€“  This jizz bucket.  He sits there and asks the kid, were you scared to go back to school?  Like what do you â€“ what do you think?  What do you think she's going to say?  Like how do you go there and ask a kid that?  Well, he's just trying to get some tears going.  Yeah.  Makes for better TV.  We all know that.  Well, you know, when these events come up, you always have to decide how deep are you going 
[01:44:00]  to go into watching the parade of it.  With Columbine, I just â€“ I couldn't stop watching it.  I was devastated.  But I watched â€“ and 9-11, I mean to this day, I've got this stack of documentaries.  And I go back to them all the time and I watch it.  With this one, as soon as it happened, I was like, I'm going to read a teeny bit in the paper.  I'm going to watch zero TV.  I haven't watched any TV.  And I'm going to catch up on it over a month.  But I don't want to fully immerse because it's just â€“ it's too much. 
[01:44:30]  They're embedded.  You've got plenty of time.  They're embedded in that town.  They're not leaving any time soon.  But you make a good point about 9-11.  I watched everything.  My line was the people jumping.  That's when I turned off the TV.  I was like, whoa, I cannot fucking watch that.  Everyone has their line.  I watched it when it happened.  Yeah, that's true.  Now I won't watch it like now.  I won't watch old news footage of that.  No, it's tough to watch.  Yeah, because, I mean, obviously you know what happened.  You know how it ends.  Yeah, I don't want to â€“  Just dwell on it. 
[01:45:00]  It's weird though.  You're like immersing yourself in that.  Yeah, zero dark 30 out this week.  Some people just dive in.  Well, we're part of it.  Like head first and stay in it and like, what are you doing to yourself?  I've done that.  Sounds stupid, but we're part of the problem because as we bitch about it, we're all going  to go watch some more today, right?  No, I â€“  You haven't watched really?  I've really steered clear of it.  I've watched a lot of it.  We're not interviewing family members.  We're just fucking trying to be funny with it and attack the people who are exploiting it.  I'm getting mad at the coverage, but I find myself watching.  So what's that about?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean? 
[01:45:30]  You feel like you have to watch it almost.  Like it's part of the national â€“ it's a national tragedy.  It's like our country's tragedy.  So it's beyond â€“  But they absolutely have a responsibility that they â€“ I feel they, you know, blow off  still.  I don't know.  It's just â€“ I just go also to all the other tragedies in the world, and so it impacts  me differently because I also get angry and think, this happens in Syria like every five  minutes all day.  Right, right, right.  And in the Congo, by the hundreds of thousands of people could care less. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  And what is our lack of interest about â€“ I mean, in Chicago, kids get killed every day  of the week.  There's been 60 shootings.  But in the Congo, there's a kid army, though.  In Chicago since â€“ 60 shootings in Chicago since the massacre.  Since the school shooting.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know, you just kind of â€“ well, whatever.  Something about it.  There's something about like a lot in a day or a â€“ but, you know, there's all sorts  of major violence problems, but they're not â€“ they don't package as well.  Yeah, yeah.  And so people don't â€“ I mean, Chicago, more people die in Chicago than in the Iraq War. 
[01:46:30]  Right, yeah.  And it's all kids.  And so why aren't people flipping out about that in a very serious way?  People have an easier time.  We were talking about Columbine.  The reason it was easier to swallow than this, even though it was awful, was a peer shooting  people they see as peers.  It's terrible, but it's easier to comprehend because we all have peers we don't like.  It's when somebody, like an adult, is shooting somebody weak, like children.  Complete innocence.  Like even when you hear about a fucking workplace massacre, it's always terrible. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  But everybody thinks of that one guy at work that'd like to fucking smash.  It's like â€“ it's not incomprehensible.  You know, it's like, wow, how did you snap like that?  Fucking rough, man.  Real rough.  So you collect autographs right here?  I do.  I do.  Your transitions are so seamless.  Thank you.  Thank you, John.  I'm hoping you would notice.  Yeah.  I do.  I do.  I went to an autograph store yesterday, and I found a Bob and Ray autograph.  Oh, neat.  Bob and Ray?  Who's he?  And I had never seen one of those.  That's two people.  Have you ever heard Bob and Ray?  Well, Chris Elliott's dad, Bob Elliott from Get a Life, was in a radio comedy team, and 
[01:47:30]  their stuff is just insanely funny.  Have you ever heard it?  Absolutely, yeah.  And when he did his show â€“ what was it called again?  Chris's show.  Oh, the new one.  No, no, the old one.  Oh, Get a Life.  Get a Life.  His dad would play his dad.  How do you display â€“ because I'm a collector, too.  I have to get them signed myself, usually, but I love shit like that.  How do you display them in your house? 
[01:48:00]  I don't really display them.  They would just take up too much space, and my wife has zero interest in the idea of me  hanging up Paul Lind autographs.  That's a cool one.  Yeah, so I don't â€“ and I keep buying them because I get a kick out of letters, like  old, pissed-off Groucho Marx letters.  Oh, cool.  I look for weird things like that, and â€“  Do you actually have one of those?  I do, and I have a lot of letters from â€“ I have a lot of letters from writers telling  people they have no time for them because they're busy writing. 
[01:48:30]  I don't know why, but I have all these letters, like Patty Chayefsky, someone saying, like,  will you do this project with us?  And him saying, no, I'm writing a movie.  Leave me alone.  Very busy.  So as a reminder to myself.  But I did this day, like, I'll go get them.  I was on Jimmy Fallon last night, and Tom Cruise was there, and it's very hard for me not to â€“  Don't you?  I always get a picture.  I mean, you're â€“  I get the picture.  I got the picture.  But to get an autograph.  Yeah.  We've got to ask you, what's your prized possession?  Of all of those? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Or one right up there.  Well, you know, some of them are just personal.  Like, my grandfather hated getting autographs, and he lived in Beverly Hills.  He would bump into people.  They got â€“ when I was a kid, they met Ringo Starr.  And this was, like, in 76, and it blew our minds.  Like, you were in the room with Ringo Starr, and he got me Cary Grant when I was a kid.  So, you know, things like that.  You still have them?  Yeah, I still have all of them.  I actually had a Groucho, Marks, autograph.  I met Groucho right before he died. 
[01:49:30]  Everyone goofs on me.  It's like, how old are you?  But it was in the 70s, and he was at some event where, I mean, like, Artie Johnson from  Laughin' was there.  It was, like, one of these weird kind of fucking events.  I don't know.  Ben Gazzaro was there.  Oh, I got a Ben Gazzaro.  You got a Ben Gazzaro?  Oh, that's a good one.  I'll trade you that for an Armand Asante.  You know what?  I like the rejection letters of something that I want to, like, you know, Gorm with the wind,  take this shit out of here.  No one will ever believe a wizard and a tin man. 
[01:50:00]  What kind of porn are you making here?  I haven't talked about the movie yet.  Yeah, right?  This is 40.  This is 40.  By the way, it comes out Friday.  Yes.  I don't know if you've heard about that.  Now, this is technically a sequel.  Would you consider it a sequel?  Well, you know, remember, it's like if they did a movie about Carlton, your doorman.  You know?  Right, right.  It's a spin-off.  We, you know, when I was a kid, they always did, you know, Mary Tyler Moore, then there'd  be Rhoda.  Yeah.  Or there was a Frasier after Cheers, so I... 
[01:50:30]  Or Aftermash, Aftermash.  Yes, Aftermash, exactly.  That's forgettable.  Joni loves Chachi.  Let's not forget.  Exactly.  So we, I always got a kick out of it as a kid.  So when we did Forgetting Sarah Marshall afterwards, we were like, it'd be good to make a whole  movie about Russell.  That character seems kind of fun.  And so then we did Get Him to the Greek, and it felt like, well, if we like any of these  characters from any of these movies, it'd be fun to see where else they go.  So you just had a lot of extra scenes.  So we just had a lot of extra scenes. 
[01:51:00]  Now, why Graham Parker?  Well, Graham Parker's a movie...  Someone we've all forgot about.  Well, Graham Parker is just a great, hilarious guy.  He was, you know, Graham Parker came out in 1974, like, before Elvis Costello and before  The Clash, and he was one of the, you know, the first kind of great rockers of that generation.  He never sold an enormous amount of records, but he was a very influential guy, and I would  buy his records for the last 30 years, and I could just tell, like, I don't think anyone  else is buying these records, but I thought they were great, and they were also like, you 
[01:51:30]  know, he can rock, but he's also, like, funny, and he's pissed off, and I like rockers  like Warren Zeevon who are kind of mad and funny, and so I needed a guy who would be  in the movie Larry Sanders style and admit that they can't sell records.  So then you're like, who could I say that to, to their face?  Everyone in this room.  And so I took Graham out to lunch and told him, and he just laughed his ass off.  He's like, oh, so I'm the loser in the movie.  You're going to shit on me.  I'm like, well, no, you're the king, but it's the record business is somewhat in shambles, 
[01:52:00]  and unless you're Rihanna, you're not selling millions of records.  And there's 200 guys like Graham that we love from the 70s and 80s who don't sell records  and make kind of great records still.  So he was up for it.  So he was getting the band back together.  They hadn't played together in 30 years.  Wow.  The rumor.  The rumor, and he recorded a record with his own money with the rumor, and he was doing  it anyway.  And so then we put, you know, the rumor in the movie, made that part of the premise, 
[01:52:30]  and now the hilarious part is the movie's so much predicated on their failure that as  a result of the movie, they're on a sold-out tour.  They got a great record with rave reviews and Rolling Stone.  And so, you know, which would happen at Larry Sanders.  Anybody who didn't mind you just calling him an asshole on the show looked so funny and  cool.  You're like, that guy can't be an asshole because he's part of this joke.  Right.  But some people would get very, don't say that, I don't want people to think that about  me.  And they never looked as good. 
[01:53:00]  So it's, you know, the self-satire, you've got to go all the way.  Who took the best beating on Larry Sanders?  Like, who was most willing to really get a good smashing?  You know, I'm trying to remember.  I mean, people, by the end of it, would go for it pretty hard.  I remember Bob Goldthwait was on the show.  Oh, shit.  And he was really funny and always one of my favorites.  Sandler was in Shakes the Clown, you know, so he's one of those guys when we were starting  up, you know, was always one of our favorites.  And he didn't realize that in scenes he wasn't in that they were attacking him. 
[01:53:30]  The joke, you know, was continuing outside of his scenes.  And I remember, like, him saying to somebody, he's just like, I didn't know you guys were  doing that.  I guess it hurts because it's true.  But he was great.  And then he's fantastic in the show.  And I remember Stephen Wright was pretty great on the show.  We had him in here.  Yeah, he was good.  And he did, like, in the episode he was slamming Bob Goldthwait, and he goes, I don't like that 
[01:54:00]  guy.  He's got weird energy.  But people are generally pretty cool.  That's a good Stephen Wright.  Yeah, I guess there's a badge of honor about taking a beating.  And like you said, people know you're in on the joke.  And so nobody really is going to say you can't.  Oh, I heard Lohan just did this thing with Charlie Sheen recently, and she, they said  was a much...  She was in on it.  Yeah, she was at first hesitant, but now...  Was that Scary Movie 5?  Yeah, but I think that was after she clogged the toilet and then got back to work.  Five days of production shut down or whatever it was. 
[01:54:30]  Really?  Oh, really?  What happened?  She clogged the toilet, which, of course, made me like her more.  But then she flooded the bathroom or something, or there was some shit that happened.  That's an old rehab trick.  Slow down.  But I kind of feel like even in our movies, it is like Larry Sanders, and you're just doing  it to yourself also.  You could do the same kind of approach to talking about your family and all the problems you're  going through as a person.  And by kind of really being rough on yourself, you're showing how much everybody is struggling 
[01:55:00]  with the same kind of ideas in their life.  And I noticed that with Shandling, where we would do the Larry Sanders show, and something  would happen in his life, and then it would kind of like slowly work its way into the show.  I remember Dana Carvey did a vicious impression of him on Saturday Night Live, like a really  mean one.  And Gary was not pleased about it.  Oh, shit.  It wasn't even like a good joke.  It was just like, he was whining the whole time. 
[01:55:30]  And there was no...  It wasn't even a great sketch.  And so he called Dana, and Dana was like, I'm so sorry, I didn't write it.  I think Robert Smigel wrote it, actually.  And Gary goes, well, we'll just do something on the show about it.  And then he wrote an episode where Dana Carvey was the guest host and just did the vicious  Larry Sanders impression.  And then he's like, I just let him guest host the show, and he just stood on me the whole  time.  So, you know, that kind of was a reminder, like, all right, you can blur that line and 
[01:56:00]  people connect more to it.  You mentioned family.  Your family's in this movie, obviously.  Your daughters are really good actresses, I should say.  And is that your mom in the movie?  I just need to know for my own...  My grandma.  It is your grandma.  My grandma has a cameo where she says to Leslie, you're 40?  You know, don't blink, because you'll blink and you'll be 90, which is what she always  says to me.  And then I saw her sister, who's 86, and she has a variation, which is, don't blink, because  you'll be dead.  Is she the older sister? 
[01:56:30]  My grandma's the older sister.  She's 90.  So she's 90, and she's in the...  Wow.  She's in the movie, and now she's in a nursing home, and she's doing well.  For years, we didn't know if, like, we could get her to go to a nursing home.  She's very independent.  She loves it.  But it is like high school at the nursing home.  Like, people are like, you know, your stuff is immature.  And I always say, look, everyone is immature.  And then you go to this nursing home, they're all 90, somewhere like 100.  And my grandma's like, they won't let you sit with them at the table at lunch. 
[01:57:00]  They're a click.  It's exactly the same.  That lady, she yelled at me because I played the piano in the sitting room.  It never is.  It never is.  Like Pauly's mother in The Sopranos when she went to the old age home, and that's exactly  what it was.  They won't sit with me at the table.  They won't play cards.  You know, she tattles on everybody.  It's like a bunch of children.  I don't know why people want to be mature.  You know, like, that's always like an attack.  Like, you're being immature.  It's always...  Like, it's a goal. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  Yeah.  It's a lot more fun to be immature.  It's always hard to talk about these movies when you guys come in here because you don't want  to give away the jokes and stuff.  But I do want to say this.  You've got to, you know, stay to the credits.  The blooper was amazing.  With Melissa McCarthy.  Well, Melissa McCarthy is really...  Hilarious.  You know, I didn't know who she was.  I guess she's been around a long time, and I just hadn't seen...  We all know her for Bridesmaids, obviously.  Yeah, she was...  Mike and Molly.  And Mike and Molly after that, but that's when we first knew about her.  But she was at Gilmore Girls, I guess, for like seven years.  Yeah, I don't know.  I didn't know.  But she came in...  Yeah, see, I hadn't seen it. 
[01:58:00]  I knew that stuff.  And then she walked in, and you're like, oh, this is like one of the crazy, funny people of  all time.  And then, you know, she's doing two scenes in my movie, and they're the funniest scenes  in the movie, by far.  Yeah, that's right.  And I don't know.  She's just...  You know what?  She has a thing that's like Farley.  She reminds me of Chris Farley a little bit.  And when she like looks you in the eye, and she's like doing this scene, there's a madness  there that makes you laugh that you don't get out of most people, where they're like  truly gone in a way that's... 
[01:58:30]  Oh, wow.  I could tell.  But the blooper scene with the principal is a massive laugh.  Yeah.  I went and saw it.  Wow.  Yeah.  She's...  Good for you, Judd.  I was not gonna...  I don't want to take it off the movie, because I know that's what you're here to talk about,  but I just want to ask your opinion, since you're so well-respected in the comedy world  that...  You're asking me or Judd?  Both of you, actually, but more him.  What...  Do you think that we live in now, like you brought up the Gary Shandling show, you brought  up all these shows.  Do you think that we live in a new golden age of like TV comedy, like with Louie and 
[01:59:00]  like all these shows and stuff like that?  I think so.  I mean, when I look at it...  I mean, your show Girls is like a dramedy, I guess you would call it.  I mean, I guess you could go, we've never beaten the all in the family moment.  And that's society.  Yeah, I mean, that was like part of the whole culture getting behind something.  Like, it's not like people are watching any of these things in mass, where 45 million  people are watching Louie as they should. 
[01:59:30]  And also, I would go as far as to say, probably none of it is as good as all in the family.  I think like there were a couple of things back then, like you couldn't do all in the  family right now.  Absolutely.  I agree with that.  I mean, I guess you could say South Park kind of does it, but in terms of like the whole  world watching it, and I don't think you could do Blazing Saddles right now.  We don't accept commentary from anybody, but real commentary is only accepted from cartoons  now.  We're in a country of dopes.  We won't take real social comedy commentary unless it's done by a cartoon character. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, it's a political requirement.  It's a mob mentality.  It's embarrassing.  But there's way more great comedy, I think.  And I think it is a golden era.  I remember when like Spies Like Us came out, I just thought, this is going wrong.  This is going the wrong way.  It just felt like a lot of people getting big paychecks and doing a lot of drugs, and  it didn't feel like there was a passion behind what they were saying.  It was like, let's do a spy movie.  And that's what we always avoid, like just like the high concept premise.  Like we try to write about something that we care about, even if it's dumb, like something 
[02:00:30]  we're like desperately passionate to talk about.  And Louie has just changed the game, I think, for everybody.  He's like, this is how hard you can work, this is how many times you can turn over your  act, here's how honest you can be, here's how you could write, you could direct, you  can edit.  So, I mean, he's basically laying down the gauntlet to everyone, like, you know, why  are you all so lazy?  Because, you know, you go on the road, how often is the comic on the road writing?  I mean, that's what I know, is I go on the road, and I would never write jokes during 
[02:01:00]  the day, but then you'd be on the road with like Larry Miller or someone, and he's  like, you know, I'm going to go write for a couple hours.  I'm like, what?  Oh, that's why you could do two hours, and I have eight minutes, and four of it is talking  to the crowd.  So I think, don't you think Louie's changed that for people?  That bastard?  Yes, well, it's funny that you brought up All in the Family, because that was like, they  were, they were breaking taboos, and they were breaking, they were doing like, really  like good things, comedically, that are inappropriate, and like SNL did that in the beginning too, and 
[02:01:30]  then there became this whole wave, and these guys, you know, to these guys, they also serve  that purpose of like, pushing the envelope, saying the, saying the inappropriate, appropriate  thing, and I feel like now that people have been so politicized into like saying that,  oh, that word, groan, wrong, whatever, and then a horrific act like the shooting happens,  and people don't know how to react, so they react harshly on the guy saying his joke or 
[02:02:00]  his whatever, or the movie, to like somehow balance the scale, and it never will.  So, I know I'm putting a lot of things together, but I would say that, yes, we will never have  those kind of shows again, because the people don't want them, they don't want that, they  don't want that, the advertisers don't want it, because the people don't want it, and  people pull the ads, like, let's start with the Aflac duck, you know, like, pulling Gilbert  over that, that was ridiculous over a joke, you know?  Special interest groups are what has, the rise of special interest groups is what has ruined 
[02:02:30]  it, because there's so much money at stake, their people are afraid the special interest  group will boycott the product, and that will hurt the networks, so the network just reacts.  And you don't think we can turn that around?  You really don't think we can turn that around eventually?  Not at all.  I mean, people aren't going to get cooler, I know that.  Well, it's related to every industry, there's a great documentary out now called The House  I Live In, and it's all about the drug sentencing, and how we've created this prison system,  where there's private prisons, they give money to politicians, they keep all of the sentencing 
[02:03:00]  really draconian, so for possession, you could be doing 10, 20 years, but they're filling  beds, and filling beds is making them money, and it's very hard to turn that back, only  the state's going bankrupt from having too many people in jail is going to change drug  sentencing, and it's the same with, I guess, probably the NRA, which is gun companies pay  these people a lot of money, they have salaries, so they're fighting for weapons that, it's hard  for anyone to say, you need that, I mean, I guess there's an argument for some of it, 
[02:03:30]  but there's definitely a line, but why don't they go, yeah, I guess maybe we're pushing  it there.  You can't have a, we get all of it, but someone is paying for that position, I think.  Of course.  Well, I think if you take the violence out of these movies, they suck, and honestly,  you know, we're not European, we're not story people, we're not, you know, drama and, you  know, big picture, so, you know, be careful what happens, I think, with the whole, you 
[02:04:00]  know, okay, I'll stop.  You're talking about in terms of the culture, like pulling back violence in movies, yeah,  America will never do that, I mean, if anything, what's fascinating is that there's PG-13 movies  that are crazy violent, but there's like a rule that if you don't show blood, you can do  anything, and so, where in Europe, they, they're totally against the violence in movies, you  have to be much older to see them, and they're okay with the sex, it's like, it's inverted,  we're here, we're weird about sex.  And all our movies are shown over there anyway, I mean, all these major violent films in America  has are shown, it's not, it's not like they're just kept here, they just, I guess, react 
[02:04:30]  differently for different reasons.  And speaking of sex, the movie opens up with a nice sex scene.  That's right.  Judd Apatow, this is 40, I'm going to sell some tickets for you.  Yeah, come on, it's hard to sex.  You have to start a movie with your wife and friend making love, you know, that's my decision,  that's something I want to see.  How do you direct that?  This is cock-holding, that was the other time.  I look away, I just go, you know, do make it look good, and I look away.  Do you really look away?  Obviously, it's all acting, but it's got to be strange on some kind of a lot.  Of course. 
[02:05:00]  They don't like it, so I get a kick out of making them do it.  Unless they're faking it, and they might be faking it, I make them do it, and so the opening  scene is them having sex, and afterwards, Paul admits that he took a Viagra, and they  get into, like, a crazy fight immediately after the sex, and I've never, I actually  took a Viagra once, a friend gave me one, I was wondering, like, what it did, and then  I was literally afraid to pursue my wife, and so I just walked around the house in the 
[02:05:30]  boner all night long.  Why were you afraid?  Because I thought if I told her, she would get mad, I was like, oh, so I can't tell  her that this is needed, and so I just panicked and didn't do anything, and that's how I thought  of the scene, like, oh, what if I told her, and she was just like, what the fuck, why  would you need that for?  Yeah, why do you need that with me?  But you just want to know the power of it, you want to know if it really does turbocharge  you.  It's amazing, amazing, isn't it?  And you use it just in general life.  Constantly.  I constantly take Cialis, and you never tell them, they just touch it, and you're like, well,  look at that, I'm a man. 
[02:06:00]  It's fun to feel like that.  What would happen if you didn't take it?  Like, what's your status without it?  Here's what happens.  I bat about 120, and I'm sitting in the bed going, I took a Dramamine, you know, because  I flew.  It's a nightmare.  It's a nightmare.  So there's no reason not to.  There's no downside, really.  We all should just be on it 24 hours a day.  All the time.  But it does, but yeah, I guess there's that thing, like, when you get older, you don't  want to admit anything's changing.  Right.  But the great thing about the Viagas, those commercials, if you watch them, the guy in the commercial  always is tall and skinny with a perfect gray short haircut, and he looks like the most 
[02:06:30]  awesome dick.  Like, he looks like an erection.  Like, you want to be him, but he looks fantastic.  You want to suck him.  Subliminal advertising.  Exactly, exactly.  Can I say one thing about your wife, who's super, super cool?  She's sexy.  That when I was in your movie, Funny People, that was my favorite part, was after the shooting,  when I was already thinking about, like, you know, this is, like, probably the only  movie I'm ever going to do, because I suck as an actor. 
[02:07:00]  It's all right.  I'm very bad as well.  Okay.  But I didn't say you were.  I thought you were delightful.  You did say as well, though.  Okay, he said as well, yeah.  I know.  I was.  But my favorite part was when we were all going back to the other camp, whatever, and you  said, do you need a ride, Dave?  And I got to ride in the van with you, your wife, and your kids.  Oh, thank you.  And I didn't know I was in there with, like, a group of future thespians.  Yes.  And I was, like, this super hot chick who's really cool, which I was, like, and this guy's,  like, the really funny director.  I'm, like, this is, like, the life I never will have, because this guy's amazing. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, thank you.  It was great.  It was, like, a make-a-wish looking in.  A little face pressed up against the, oh, what's happening there?  They may be available for you soon.  What, your kids?  You know, I get divorced at some point.  You can get the whole package.  The whole package just swings over to you.  You keep banging out these bromances and comedies.  I like them, too.  I'm a talking chimp now and again.  What is this rate in this movie?  It's rated R.  It is.  Whoa.  Good.  It's rated R.  You can't really do anything not rated R comedically. 
[02:08:00]  I mean, I guess.  What makes it an R, really?  I mean, there is a press.  Well, just if you say fuck twice.  If you say fuck twice.  That's all it takes now?  Yeah, which is crazy in America.  You know, my kids.  That's so frustrating.  My kids have seen everything, like just having kids, you see that you could assume that you  can block things, but you can't.  The second they go to a friend's house, they could just stay up and just watch any movie.  They could watch Breaking Bad.  They can watch American Horror Story.  And so I just try to have a relationship with them where they'll talk to me about it. 
[02:08:30]  My daughter, who's 10, she has a funny thing.  She'll like search things like on YouTube all the time.  And then if something shocking comes up, she instantly searches the word bunny and then  it just shows like a bunny.  And so that's how I know she saw something bad because I'll hear her go, bunny!  So like the other day, they were searching, well, they love American girl dolls.  So they like these dolls.  They look up American boy, which is a gay porn site.  And then I just hear, bunny! 
[02:09:00]  Oh, they look up like inflatable, they were looking up like rafts.  They look up inflatable toys.  Oh, no, no.  It's not rafts.  It's not rafts.  The default is always porn.  You're only, yeah.  It's like, what are you, like two clicks away usually, maybe?  I needed for my luggage a strap-on.  Oh, no.  Did you?  No.  It's not.  But they're going to see everything.  So then it becomes a question of will they tell you, will they help you decode it?  And do they just hide in their room and look at it for hours? 
[02:09:30]  Or are they going to do what I did, which is kind of get freaked out and never look again  until college?  But is everything, I don't know, I don't have kids, so is everything your business?  I mean, like, eventually they're going to have their own lives.  I feel like that's the world that we live in.  You seem like a really good parent.  Like, eventually they're going to have to have their own life and we won't be their filter.  Well, I think that it's a joke to think that you're really filtering them.  You're not filtering them.  They're just sneaky.  You're developing a relationship with them where my kids will tell me they looked up American 
[02:10:00]  Boy.  And then if they go like, oh, my God, it was crazy.  What did you see?  And then you could explain, well, I don't know, some people like to have blow-up toys in the  shape of women.  And I guess, I don't know how we feel about that.  You mean you actually do it with the Zelmo puppet?  You actually do parenting.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't think there's anything else you can do because we try to be a little bit  more like the Frank Zappa family.  Like, they're not going to die if they hear the F curse.  I mean, it'll be fine.  It's just language.  I'm more about, like, being cruel. 
[02:10:30]  Like, are you being mean to people?  Are you judgmental?  Well, but, you know, words, they can enjoy Dave's act and have a nice night.  You know what I'm saying?  In your television program.  I don't do any rap.  I want to go back to This is 40 for a second because you mentioned it's R-rated.  To me, that's so ridiculous.  It doesn't feel like an R-rated movie, but obviously it's the language which we're so  uptight with in this country.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  I mean, especially because kids watch everything on the Internet that has language.  There's no filter on the Internet. 
[02:11:00]  Right.  So it is that, like, last thing where, like, oh, my God, Bono said fuck by accident on  the Grammys, and people debated the fine for 10 years while kids are just home watching  everything on Earth.  It's like a remnant of people in the bureaucracy who can't let go and acknowledge, like, no,  it's over.  The line is gone for the most part.  Let me take that point.  John Jackson, the nipple.  It was not even a second.  The outrage was incredible.  But look what we're seeing today with the school shooting. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, they'll show that.  Just so you know, I have a two-and-a-half-year-old.  I would much rather him see a dumb nipple on TV than this horrific 24-hour news cycle on  the school shooting.  Well, it's like saying a kid could suck on a nipple to eat all day long but can't look  up and see it.  Don't look at it.  The hypocrisy drives me nuts.  Well, watch.  That's what I'm getting at.  I mean, pay attention.  You'll notice this as a father.  Watch what happens as you really tune into the amount of dead bodies on the news and 
[02:12:00]  on commercials for the news where I'll be with my kids and, like, there'll be like a  piece.  I mean, there was a piece on, you know, one of the big magazine shows about Syria.  And it was worse than any movie I've ever seen.  And there's no warning about it.  It just goes there.  My example, did you see Ted?  Yes, I did.  Okay.  So we finally saw it this weekend.  And it starts off a lot of cursing, like your movie.  And me and my wife look at each other, our son's in the room. 
[02:12:30]  And we're like, you know what?  We silently said, fuck it.  Let him watch.  I'm not worried about that.  And then later in the movie when they kidnap Ted, it got really dark.  And my son piped up like, this is scary.  I'm like, you know what?  You're right.  That was my line there.  But the language, I don't care.  I'll explain that stuff to him.  Yeah.  When people are like, you know, people are mean or torture each other.  You know, that's kind of what I'm trying to.  It's way worse than a curse.  Yeah.  But my daughter's 15.  And I'll tell you, she loves that Breaking Bad more than anything.  That's right.  She loves it. 
[02:13:00]  It's a good.  So I don't know.  I also started going, she's 15.  Like, I went to college at 17.  Like, you know, where do you let, you know, let them kind of develop their own interests?  That's a great.  Wouldn't you rather have her watch that than, you know, The Bad Girls Club or like one of  these other, like, you know, Shoe Rescue or, you know, like one of these reality stupid  shows, you know.  She watches those as well.  Cupcake Wars.  Well, they love, I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant.  Yes.  That's their favorite.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's like a girl who like twists her ankle, puts on 40 pounds. 
[02:13:30]  And eight months later, you know, goes to the bathroom and a baby comes out.  I thought I got heavy because I twisted my ankle.  I thought your daughter liked Lost.  She did.  Well, that's how we thought of it.  It's in a movie.  This is 40.  She watched all of Lost in six weeks.  Oh, man.  And she was crying like every day as she was so emotional.  And she's like, this is the best show ever.  But like really suffering and going through too many emotions too fast.  And we're like, what episode are you on?  She's like, 85. 
[02:14:00]  And like, okay, well, she's got 25.  Should we just let her get through it to get over this?  Or do we stop it now?  And that's a new thing with kids too, which is they will absorb, you know, a series in  a couple of weeks that we took seven years to watch.  We're just jealous.  Yeah.  What does that do to your brain to do like a season of 24 in the weekend?  It's healthy though.  I think it's healthy to cry through stuff like that because it's like, it's a good,  like I cried through Lost too.  Like it's humiliating.  Like, but I did because it's like a healthy release.  It's like, you should learn that it's okay to, even if it's not, you know, watching the 
[02:14:30]  news is what it kind of probably should happen, but at least you're crying.  It's a healthy thing.  It's not healthy to repress.  You took that real moment and put it in.  This is 40.  So she puts, she used to put the soundtrack on in the car and there's a song on Lost.  It's just like a little piano dirge.  And they would always play it when a character died.  And so in the car, she would just start bawling.  That's the song when Sun died.  Oh, that's right.  She did die in the boat. 
[02:15:00]  Didn't she drown or something?  I don't think it went well for any of them, really.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't think it.  See, I'm jealous because like Breaking Bad, I think is like an old man show.  You know, it's about, you know, mortality, choices, defeat, you know, like what's her,  what is it?  Well, I don't know.  I think it's like seeing the drama of life and then, you know, like you're a kid and you're  not exposed to anything and suddenly you're exposed to all of the dramas of life through  the show. 
[02:15:30]  And so she's fascinated by it.  And she's kind of hilarious and an interesting girl.  So she's, she's deep.  She goes for that stuff.  That's cool.  And so I'd say, you know, I don't know, scary, but we, we allow it because we're also  kind of excited.  They like something good.  Yeah, it's really, you know, when they like kind of stop listening to like some of the  Disney music and they're like put on a Pearl Jam record without you asking, you're like,  oh, this is the best day of my life.  Well, it shows that they're smart because when I was younger, I liked stuff that was  older than me.  I watched the Honeymooners when I was a kid. 
[02:16:00]  I watched MASH when it was, you know, I was, I was eight, nine years old.  I enjoyed MASH or Clockwork or whatever it was, you know, it's like, you don't have  to be from that generation to like it.  Yeah.  No, it's great when your kid's like, you're like, what do you do today?  I just watched The Graduate.  Really?  You just watched The Graduate by yourself?  How do you think to watch The Graduate?  That's great.  So.  What do you own from Shayefsky?  I own just a funny letter with him, just him rejecting someone that wanted him to write  a play for something.  But he's the best. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, Network's still, I mean, when you talk about what's happening now, the movie Network  predicts everything.  That is happening.  I mean, you watch, I mean, literally watch it this week and, and you'd be baffled that  some guy wrote this in 1976.  He saw where reality TV was going.  He saw with the Symbian Liberation Army.  He saw all this stuff coming.  Yeah, we say it every time.  When that movie came out, there was no reality shows.  There were no 24 hour news cycles.  None of it.  None of it.  And corporations owning the networks and how that would change what they would put on  them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a pretty amazing piece of work.  Or the idea of the, uh, the talking head, which is kind of what Peter Finch became at 
[02:17:00]  the end.  Even though we didn't have that.  No.  When that movie came out, they just gave you the news.  That was it.  Yeah.  Did they really do editorials in the seventies?  A little bit at the end of the news.  It was almost a throwaway.  Like, you know, they had 30 seconds left.  So they'd have the station manager would come out and give an editorial.  It was always a funny.  Some guy could give a rebuttal, but it was a big deal.  Like when Walter Cronkite like took eight seconds to go like, maybe Vietnam's a bad idea.  Like the whole country flipped out because no one said their opinion. 
[02:17:30]  No.  It took like forever for that to happen.  You might've been the first.  Uh, they said that changed the feeling of the, in the country of the war.  They said Cronkite saying it was bad, had a tremendous impact on people because he just  didn't do that.  The war was unwinnable.  Yeah.  Is that what he said?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now no one has any impact at all.  No.  There's too many voices.  And they all are giving their opinions on everything.  That's what they're doing.  They're all trying to have impact.  Everyone is trying to have impact, but because we're watching 500 different people, no one  gives a shit what any of them say.  No one cares. 
[02:18:00]  True.  I just, I, you know, people think, uh, I watch Fox because my political affiliations, they  just have the hottest girls.  More so than C-man or anything.  That's a Patty Chayefsky idea, which is that the most conservative place would have the  youngest, hottest, hottest women.  I mean, it does like brainwash you.  Like she thinks this and she was, looks like a sorority girl.  It's a very specific kind of blonde look that you get because Democrats were all like a 
[02:18:30]  little dirty.  It's different.  It's a different kind of feel.  Different feel.  The commentators, you don't get that.  Like, uh, like MSNBC has like roller derby queens on.  You gotta put some fucking hotter women on there.  I mean, I think Rachel Maddow is attractive, even though she's, wow.  I do.  I know she's not, she's slightly masculine, but she's, I think she's, seriously, I think  she's an attractive woman.  She's not an ugly woman at all.  She doesn't want to dress like that on TV.  They dollied her up.  But I'm not unattractive to her.  They softened her up a little bit.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I know she probably wouldn't feel that way about me, but I, she's attractive to her. 
[02:19:00]  Unfortunately, we're getting the wrap up.  Oh boy.  Okay.  Judd Apatow, you don't come around enough.  He's a busy guy.  I might come back.  I might come back.  I might come back, uh, more to New York.  We got a place in New York, so maybe I'll come back.  And you tweet a lot.  I've noticed that too.  You tweet, and you tweet pictures, which is very cool.  Like, you're not, you're not, uh, against, uh, you know, being at an award show or something  and taking pictures backstage and stuff.  That's kind of cool.  Because that's kind of what I would want to see.  Yes.  Like, Tom Cruise was there last night.  I'm like, I'm going to tweet a picture of me and Tom Cruise. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Fuck, I'll tweet a picture.  Judd Apatow.  Come on, let's do it right now.  Has anyone turned you down?  Let's keep this going.  For a photo?  Uh, no.  People are kind of pretty good.  I, I do a funny thing, which is if there's a photographer at an event, I'll just like also stand  near somebody, you know, like, I got a good picture with Brad Pitt in an event recently.  They're like, this is the camera guy.  I'm like, take a picture of me.  And I just like stand like really near him.  You're still from Long Island, man.  Yeah.  That's a long island thing.  That's a better photo to be like lurking in the background of a shot with Angelina Jolie. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  It's like, hey, look who that is back there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, we took a weird picture of me and Cruise and Dr. Oz.  I just, oh, that's a funny people to be in the hallway together.  I love that what they're talking about.  I love that he does that.  I do too.  I do it every time.  You're so famous and he still does it.  I go and get a shot with the other guys.  Yeah.  You got everybody.  I get a lot of them.  Yeah.  I mean, I try to.  I mean, I try.  What's the weirdest one that you got?  We got, we only had Bernard Getz on.  I got Bernie Getz.  That's pretty good. 
[02:20:30]  I got Sharpton.  My best is Sabbath as a band and me, but that's just a personal love.  I have a lot of them.  I just got Pete Townsend the other day.  That'd be a nice one.  I want to see The Who in Brooklyn.  That's a biggie.  That was a great moment to get to Pete Townsend.  It takes balls because it's like, on some level they talk to you like you're a normal  person that they can respect.  And then right at the end, you're like, we're taking pinky pinky.  Ah, you've got to be the fan.  All your coolness just goes out the window.  Do you know what, though?  We're about to do that with you. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  The cycle continues.  It's not like they're going to call you if you don't.  Like, you know what I mean?  I figure it takes two seconds.  Fuck them.  You know, whatever.  I did let him with Ben Affleck once, and he was a really nice guy.  He came into the dressing room.  He's like, hey.  I'm like, hey, man.  And I'm like, do you want to take a picture?  He goes, all right.  Like, he was just coming in to say hi, and I took a picture.  But if I didn't do that, would he have called me and said, look, what are you doing  later?  I want to hang.  He may have.  He may have.  He would have forgot about me the minute we were done anyway, so I'm going to get the  picture.  So you're like ruining the relationship right off the bat.  I acknowledge there never will be a relationship because I respect them enough to know they're 
[02:21:30]  not going to want to talk to me.  Oh, Jim.  Seriously, we're just doing a thing together.  That's it.  All right.  We've got to get Judd out.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Question.  Well, last time I was here, we showed a clip from that ungodly, the three stooges.  Yeah, that's a big.  Yeah, never mind.  The three stooges movie.  Yes.  And did they ever release that?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  No, not yet. 
[02:22:00]  And they're still tweaking it?  That's still being shown to focus groups and edited.  Edited.  They're still working.  It didn't look as bad, though.  Remember, we thought it was going to suck.  Oh.  Because it looked like just stooge gags.  It wasn't like they were.  Yeah, but that shit doesn't go over very well now for some reason.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  How'd the music go?  Why didn't they ask you?  They should have asked you for that.  Then my manager said to me, do you want to audition?  And I said, I'll fire you.  I don't look like Curly.  You don't want to be Curly? 
[02:22:30]  I don't look like him.  There's a million actors.  There was a comic named Smitty years ago.  He used to do Rascal's Open Mic.  I don't know what ever happened to him.  Yeah.  But he looked like Curly.  He was Curly?  Yes.  He was a big guy with a fucking crew cut.  He would always call his wife the Mrs.  He was a really weird, funny guy.  It's like old school.  Yeah, me and the Mrs., but he meant it.  Go home to the Mrs.  Yeah, the Mrs.  You know, baking a cake.  Three Stooges slated for 2012, huh?  Yeah, April 13th.  April.  Oh, it's coming up soon.  Avril. 
[02:23:00]  Well, it is the Farrelly brothers.  Larry Davidson, it is a nun.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, man, I forgot.  Oh, it's going to be a killer.  Who plays the studios?  Nobody's, right?  Will Sasso.  Chris.  Mad TV.  Diamentopolis as Mo.  Will Sasso as Curly.  Sean Hayes as Larry.  They're better off not getting big celebrities.  Nicole Snooki-Polizzi as herself.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  That's all you need to know.  Truth's on your side, Bubba.  Mike in Situation, Sorrentino as himself.  What?  A little Jersey Shore crossover. 
[02:23:30]  Why would you do that in a movie?  Jennifer Hudson.  This is a strong cast.  It ends up looking silly.  You got to bring the kids in.  Yeah.  After a while, though, like, then the movie two years later, if it's on, you're like,  uh, not that that's a classic movie without them in it.  Yeah, but once they pop up, you're like, oh, I was tired of those guys.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I've been hearing some early, early Oscar buzz.  Yeah.  Three Stooges.  What are you talking to?  Did you ever date a girl who said she loved the Three Stooges?  Did you ever have a girl who said... 
[02:24:00]  No.  Actually.  Yeah.  They never do it.  Once they get married to you, they hate them.  But I think girls are told, you know, if you really want to get to the guy, you're telling  them you like the Three Stooges and you like baseball.  It's like, wow, she's perfect, man.  She's hot.  Likes the Stooges.  No.  Women don't like slapstick, those dummies.  They don't like slapstick at all.  They don't appreciate it.  Because they're usually on the receiving end of it.  Call my dinner.  You.  That's true.  You're getting a moe fucking frying pan over the head.  Dude, they don't understand the beauty of Shemp getting a fucking broom driven into his 
[02:24:30]  face.  It's like, do you understand how great that is?  Yeah.  The two by four swinging and hitting both of them.  That was a good one.  I mean, that was fantastic.  It's funny every time.  But it's a male gender thing.  And I tell you, I know this because I got these three little boys all in the age of five.  And the four and a half year old and the two and a half year old, not too long ago, I  came downstairs because the two and a half year old was screaming.  And I was like, well, what the fuck's going on?  And the four and a half year old scooter was over in the corner. 
[02:25:00]  And he was just laughing his ass off.  I couldn't even get him to focus to say, what's wrong?  What happened?  What happened to Sluggo?  And I'm looking at him.  And my wife comes down.  She's saying, so anyway, we're interrogating.  It's been about a minute.  And we finally realize what's happened is the four and a half year old had reached into the  fishbowl, pulled out a goldfish and stuffed it down Sluggo's diaper.  So he's now got a fish down his pants.  That means, what that means is the four and a half year old instinctively understood that  fish down the pants was funny as a thing.  Right?  And my wife didn't get it. 
[02:25:30]  She was chastising.  Well, you know, this fish could have died.  You can imagine the horror of the fish being stuck in there with my two and a half year old unit.  So, but the fish left.  Happy ending.  But I guess my point being is, it's a male thing.  The boys instinctively understood it was funny.  Well, a woman would never do that just because they figured that, you know, it's redundant.  Don't even.  Oh, stop it. 
[02:26:00]  You know, that's where I draw the line with your show.  Yeah, you're really going to do that.  You're going to start alienating the ladies.  That is though, but guys do find that really funny.  And it's just like you said, it's instinctive.  It's inbred in our genes.  There was one scene I saw recently where I guess they were in a mine and they got all the mining tools.  And you know when the mining tools come in that something hilarious is afoot. 
[02:26:30]  And one of them, I think it might have been Curly had the pick.  And he swings back and hooks, I guess, Larry's suspenders.  And instead of looking to see what it's hooked on, turning around, unhooking it, and getting back to work,  he just starts pulling very hard and stretching Larry's suspenders out until he loses the grip on the pick,  which then is rocketed toward Larry's head, making a giant clang, which would have killed any man. 
[02:27:00]  Killed!  So if you can't get to the theater, make sure to get your film on tape where you describe the movie.  Describe it.  His head should have been split open and he would have been instantly killed, but he just goes,  Hey, watch what you're doing over there.  Hey, you, I'm warning you.  To have a fucking, like a pick, just ricochet back into your forehead.  Can you climb a little stooge, Danny, just for a second? 
[02:27:30]  The one where any time there's tools to be used, when they were doing carpentry and Curly did something stupid  and Moe grabbed a handsaw and he goes, stick your tongue out.  And he stuck his tongue out and he just runs, he takes his thumb so he gets a straight line,  puts his thumb on Curly's tongue and then runs the saw blade down the middle of his tongue.  And you hear the sound like, wah!  It's fantastic.  It really was just such brutal, harsh punishment for little infractions. 
[02:28:00]  Terrible.  With those infractions built up.  He deserved every one of them.  I loved Shemp.  A lot of people didn't like Shemp.  Shemp was great.  Shemp was really funny, yeah.  Yeah, Shemp is an acquired taste.  People liked Curly more.  Curly Joe stunk.  Curly Joe Besser, I hated.  It was hateable.  Yeah, that was the later ones.  Yeah, yeah, that was the later ones.  Was he 39 when he died?  How old was Curly when he died?  Curly?  I thought he was older.  Yeah, I can't hear it.  Quite a fat fuck.  Why, I haven't heard that word for years. 
[02:28:30]  You know, Bub, I was once a tramp like you.  Oh, congratulations.  Ah, but it wasn't always thus.  I can look back to the days of y'all when I was a very happy married man.  And one day that rat came and destroyed forever all the happiness that I knew.  It's like a dickhead on his head.  I'll never forget that day.  I just came home from the grave.  Yeah.  There was a note on a pillow.  What did it say?  Oh, it was one of those cold-blooded notes.  Oh, this is like them doing dialogue.  Get one of them hitting each other.  I want to see them hitting each other.  We got the one clip of them talking. 
[02:29:00]  One.  I put in, I put in like the best of Stooges thinking that it would be nothing but like  the best physical getting hit in the face.  No, it's the slowly eyes turn.  There you go.  There's some smack in the face.  It's just a punch in the face.  Punch me in the face.  They were pretty good like stuntmen.  Amazing.  Excuse me, kid.  It didn't look like they were pulling punches.  You know, I'll cut my losses and I'll click on slap, smacks, and pokes.  Yeah.  Larry had a callus on his face from getting slapped so many times. 
[02:29:30]  Larry fine.  No way.  Yes, he did.  Wrestlers get cauliflower ear from wrestling.  For years he did this, yeah.  He didn't do it.  And you did.  It's just.  Get out.  Oh, it's.  They're just smacking each other.  I know this is terrible on the radio.  Just smacking.  Fuck him.  It's all face.  Get their own monitors.  Yeah.  Oh, broom to the fucking head. 
[02:30:00]  Every time.  Can you turn it a little bit, Danny?  That's good.  That's good.  How did this pitch go?  We got three guys who just beat each other up.  It's just all fucking face slaps.  I like the.  Oh.  I like the two fingers in the eyes.  That's a classic.  You can't poke my eye, poking fingers.  Good.  Now you can't poke us in the eye.  How did he do that?  How did he do that?  How did he?  Really hard. 
[02:30:30]  Really hard.  Wow.  I remember they used to present this with a guy called Officer Joe Bolton in New York on the one of the local stations.  And he used to do a little warning beforehand.  Now, kids, remember, don't do what you see the three stooges doing.  You could hurt your playmate or brother and sister.  Because I think kids were taking their two fingers.  That was the one with the pick.  Taking their two fingers and driving them into their friend's eyeballs. 
[02:31:00]  He was the one with these.  You get into it.  He has five.  He has five.  He smacks them in the face.  This could be the greatest fucking YouTube clip ever.  It's only them hitting each other.  No storyline.  No nothing.  You got to tell people where to go for this.  Oh, yeah.  What is it?  YouTube?  Slaps, smacks, and pokes on you. 
[02:31:30]  It's only got 82,000.  It's the best clip ever.  Who the fuck?  Pete, how do you not like this?  I don't know.  Here's the thing.  This is what I should say.  If you have a vagina, you will hate this clip.  Porcupine.  And the Foley guys had to be amazing on this, too.  Oh, my God, yeah.  You had to find the sound of bopping someone in the head with your fist.  Lead pipes.  Oh, that's Curly Besser.  He stunk.  Joe Besser stunk. 
[02:32:00]  Not so hard.  I'll give you such a pinch.  Would he say that?  Yeah.  Oh, the hammer.  Hammer on the head.  Oh, they have the horse kicking him in the face.  Kicked him in the face by a horse.  It's just back kicking them both in the face.  See, he'd go like, I think he was supposed to be a little effeminate.  Was that him?  Yeah.  That was Joe Besser. 
[02:32:30]  Joe Besser.  You're the anesthetist.  Don't call me names.  You okay?  Yeah.  Who thought that would work?  Who thought...  Are you one?  Oh!  He was awful.  But they're showing a lot of the ones with him.  Yeah, get rid of him.  Yeah.  He's like a weird character.  He's like Hitchcock.  Yeah.  Oh, look what you did.  You were able to give you the hot face.  That's what I want to do.  The what?  I don't know.  I don't like him. 
[02:33:00]  I'm spending too much time on him.  I know.  Too much time with Joe Besser.  Boo.  It's almost like they did it in chronological order.  Yeah, yeah.  Boo!  Yeah.  It used to work chronologically.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  These are the last few where it's like they were real wrinkled.  And they were just concerned they were going to really hurt each other after a while.  Oh!  Yeah, they'd show them in New York.  And they actually got...  I remember as a kid, they actually got Moe Howard to do a promo for Officer Joe Bolton's 
[02:33:30]  Three Stooges show that would come on on Channel 11 here in New York.  Or Channel 9, one of the two.  And they got Moe to do a promo.  And all he said was like, you're watching the Three Stooges on WPIX.  And he was so fucking old that as a kid it freaked me out because I'm watching him for  years and years as, you know, that energetic guy that's the one pretty much in charge beating 
[02:34:00]  up the other guys.  And there he was, just all his gray Moe haircut.  Was he making money by all the kids who could come up and smack him?  You know, five bucks a smack?  Yeah, at an appearance, you'd just smack him.  And there was Officer Joe Bolton.  But you could show that slaps, smacks, and pokes clip to a room full of women and be crickets.  They would look at it the way we watched The View.  Yeah.  Just hating it.  Yeah, not understanding it and hating it. 
[02:34:30]  They wouldn't giggle or fucking howl at the...  Because they don't understand.  Because they're too busy making biscuits.  They don't understand how great a fucking wrench to the forehead is.  Wrenching?  Making biscuits?  Yeah, do you know what a wrench to the forehead is?  Oh, put these...  Let me hear this.  That was...  Oh, the Magic Garden, bitches.  Magic Garden.  This is...  Yeah, this is just like a huge compilation of...  Can we hear that song, the Magic Garden song?  Channel 11 here in New York stuff.  Yay!  Oh, and the one girl would skip and... 
[02:35:00]  I don't remember.  Skip behind the show.  I want to hear the Magic Garden song, though.  Oh, find the Magic Garden.  Didn't it go like, this is the Magic Garden?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, here's the opening theme.  Would she skip?  Was one of the chicks hot and one looked like a dyke?  Yeah.  I had a crush on one of these girls.  Yeah, yeah.  Which one?  Oh, man.  The Magic Garden, get it?  It's where the bush is.  Right?  Lesbian?  One big happy family. 
[02:35:30]  And you and us together.  Who'd you like?  Oh, the one on the right.  The one on the left.  It must have been the one on the right.  The one on the right was the cute one.  The one on the left is balding.  Jesus.  The one on the left looks like a skinny Mama Cass.  A big oval head.  She looks like Tom Petty.  Yeah, the other one was hot.  What's this folksy shit?  What happened in the Magic Garden?  I don't know.  They would tell stories. 
[02:36:00]  Would they?  Oh, man.  They had a box with costumes and they would reenact stories.  She's the awful one.  Oh, wait a big...  What's happening?  Birds play tricks and a magic tree grows lollipop sticks.  Oh, yeah.  We know what that means.  They're playing patty cakes, sitting on mushrooms.  Yay.  They're sitting on mushrooms.  Pulling costumes out of their box.  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  Cock-a-doodle-doo.  Get it?  And flap your hands and stamp your shoes.  Oh, that's great stuff.  Wow. 
[02:36:30]  This is...  Flower song out.  So you used to watch this now?  Yeah, a lot.  Jimmy, you're dead?  77.  I was nine.  I was a boy.  What did I know?  I was smoking pot.  She grew in the Magic Garden.  Yeah.  What happened to these girls?  Are they dead?  I hope so.  We should find out where they are.  Get them on the show.  I'd love to talk to them.  Recreate this moment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sit them on a swing.  Find out what happened to the girls from the Magic Garden.  You sit them on a swing and then drive a truck right into them.  By the way, this right now, this is what information is, how fast it is. 
[02:37:00]  Like, we want to know immediately.  Right.  We can watch them, hear the song, and find out if they're alive or dead.  You would have to go to, like, the television, the Museum of Broadcasting.  Yes.  And hope you could pull up a clip from that.  I went to one of these concerts as a little kid at the Nassau Coliseum.  The Magic Garden ladies did big gigs?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  How was it?  I was, like, four or five, but I just remember all the kids' clothes were pink and orange  because they had a squirrel and some other little puppet animal that would come into the 
[02:37:30]  Magic Garden.  Are you sure you didn't just dream this last night?  No, no, no.  He's our little fat boy.  Rung, rung, rung, rung, rung, rung.  They had flowers that would laugh called the Chuckle Patch.  Oh, yeah, the Chuckle Patch sucked.  Fucking boobs.  What the hell is that?  Well, apparently they still promote this shit.  What?  Uh, yeah.  Are they still doing something?  There was some, like, retrospective on PIX, and they just put a, there was a DVD that  contained ten episodes released in 08, and they still, uh, they still go around doing 
[02:38:00]  public appearances and live children shows under the title Carol and Paula, Friends Forever.  I guess they can't do Magic Garden.  Post means shit without pictures.  I want to see pictures of, uh...  Of them?  Of them.  Yeah.  Let's see if you can find a picture of the Chuckle Patch, too.  And what now?  Yeah.  Carol and Paula, there you go.  Fucking go down on your chuckle.  Oh, no.  There you go.  Whoa!  Oh, man!  They don't look as bad as I would have thought 40 years later.  And 35 years later, dude.  Which one's which?  Yeah, which one's fucking which? 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, the big toothy one.  The one's got big, annoying teeth.  Big, giant teeth.  Guys, you, we are in for a fucking treat.  Why?  What?  Because I think we could check these guys out if we want.  What?  Are they hookers now?  All right, updated 3-12-12.  That's like the other day.  That was the hot one, I think.  Carol Demas.  Yeah, I think.  I think it was the hot one.  This is the fucking worst.  Oh, here we go.  Tuesday, March 13th.  Bronx, New York.  Oh, boy.  It was yesterday.  God damn it. 
[02:39:00]  April 1st, Bayshore.  Carol and Paula celebrate the Magic Garden.  40th birthday.  Wow.  This is it.  The big 4-0.  Where is this?  Let's go there and heckle.  In Bayshore.  Bayshore, Long Island?  Yeah!  Let's go.  That's right by you.  Let's go and boo.  Boo!  This show sucks!  Fuck you!  Show us your tit!  Tinker Tailor Soldier Whores!  It's all nonsense.  Oh, my God.  Look.  Time.  That time.  What songs do they sing?  Oh, God.  I want to go see the Magic Garden. 
[02:39:30]  I'm sure they opened with a theme song to the Magic Garden.  Is that the hot one?  I can't tell.  There was never a hot one.  No, that one was kind of hot.  There was one that was more attractive than the other.  Do you think there are a better ones?  Just call it the better one.  The better one.  The less offensive one.  Are they married or no?  Oh, boy.  To each other or other people?  What are you implying?  I mean, other people.  What?  Yeah, it did say that one of them was married with some kids.  Oh, okay.  To a cuck.  Yeah, cuckold.  He likes his wife to sit on a swing. 
[02:40:00]  Sit on another mushroom.  They're available for special events.  Fundraisers, concerts, private parties.  Forty fucking years later, and they're still milking this Magic Garden thing.  That's cool.  You can get them for it.  Private parties.  Private parties.  You just have them come over to your house and nobody else is there.  I should.  Just you.  Just me.  Oh, you're sitting there clanking.  Just jacking it.  Oh, God.  All you have to do is just email them and you could probably get a quote.  I could probably get a quote.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe for the next compound party.  I'm going to get five G's.  You could email them from their webpage.  Say, I'm having a party at my house. 
[02:40:30]  It's a pool party.  Do you know what, dude?  That would be great to get the Magic Garden.  Oh, yeah.  We'd probably all have a good time and clap and shit.  Oh, everyone's drinking and fucking naked in the pool.  And they are, too.  They are, too.  They're fucking.  They love giving oral.  They'd bring the magic swing with a hole drilled in the bottom.  You could do amyl nitrate through it and blow your friend.  Oh, shit.  Wow, well, look at that. 
[02:41:00]  Instant information there.  Oh, lovely.  Oh, that's a series of photos.  Where are the old pictures?  Oh, that's two old pictures of our top.  How much to get these gals at the...  Let's email them.  Say, yo, we're looking to throw a party.  Bunch of men.  We're going to ask you to wear cracker costumes.  We'll stand in a circle and play you little songs.  You know, I remember when I was a kid watching you.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got my first heart on.  Yeah, send a creepy, trying-to-be-friendly email. 
[02:41:30]  And I would get such a tent in my pants, LOL.  How much?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just be a bunch of men standing around.  We would have booked them for a party and then send them to, like, 150th and Malcolm X Boulevard.  Playing that shite music that they play.  Which one you stand in the corner, there'll be a bunch of guys drinking old English.  Eisenhower Park.  They're all over Long Island.  Port Jeff.  What the fuck is going on?  They sell out.  The Magic Gardens are all over Long Island.  How much are they?  I don't know how much they ought to get.  Admission. 
[02:42:00]  Free.  It can't be that much.  How about your 5Gs?  Give me a few thousand, yeah.  I wouldn't even think that much.  No fucking way.  They probably do it for, like, a grand each.  Yeah, that's probably more like it.  Two grand.  Who's going to pay more for them?  Play some shitty 70s folk songs?  Exactly.  I would love to hear those folk songs.  It's memorabilia.  It's walk down memory lane.  It's bringing back your childhood.  Who wouldn't pay a lot of money to bring back you?  Never mind.  I know.  It falls into a weird category of nostalgia.  Like, as you got older, you're not going to want to hear stupid, folky kid songs. 
[02:42:30]  I want to hire fucking Alan Alda to come over and just do caulk-eye lines in my apartment.  Is that what you're thinking?  Caulk-eye.  Caulk-eye.  Yes, caulk-eye.  That's when a doctor fixes your tub.  Caulk-eye.  Jimmy.  Yeah, they're available with the original cast of Grease.  Yeah, that's...  Ew.  Oh, Carol is starring on Broadway. 
[02:43:00]  That happened.  We missed that, folks.  What part did she play?  I bet she played Rizzo.  She was Rizzo.  Sandy.  What?  Yeah.  How old is she?  She can't play Sandy.  It's a different version of Grease.  So they meet in an old age home, and Danny Zuko breaks his hip, and Sandy nurses him back  to health, and then Craterface puts a finger in Danny Zuko's bottom.  Stranded on the toilet, branded a fool.  Tell me more, tell me more.  Like, did he have diabetes? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, shit.  It's Grease Lightning.  It's about a walker or a wheelchair.  Diuretic.  It's got rubber grips and tennis balls on the feet.  Grease Lightning, go, Grease Lightning.  It's got a little thing for you to hang your piss bag off of.  Summer Lovin' is about an orally molesting you. 
[02:44:00]  I had a pillow put over my face.  I smelled cocoa butter all over the place at the home.  I wish I had seen this movie, so I could have more fun. 
[02:44:30]  I got nothing.  I never saw the movie.  I never saw Grease Lightning.  The last song, they're bombittable.  I got cancer cells, they're multiplying.  And I'm losing lots of weight.  And they're divided.  That would have been a good one.  And the chemo you're supplying.  And my bladder's lost control.  My piss is electrified.  Why is this so fucking funny? 
[02:45:00]  Too bad you can't stand up.  Ow, ow, ow.  Ah, shit.  Yeah, that's great.  Picking out tombstones.  You're the one that I want.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That was a fun one.  Yeah.  I wish I could remember more of the songs.  I know.  I should really be looking down at this.  We go together. 
[02:45:30]  How did we go together go?  We go together.  Like sham-a-lam-a-lam-a.  A bunch of noise.  Oh, good.  His iPhone is available.  Oh, you're right.  I hate that part.  Who would?  Oh, God.  See, like when I'm flipping through the channels and this is on, it's instant off.  Yeah, yeah.  Instant off.  Why would you watch it?  I will say, though, that what was Sandy's song that was really good? 
[02:46:00]  When she sang alone.  I'm sorry.  Hopelessly devoted to you.  That's a good song.  Hopelessly devoted.  That was a huge hit.  It was.  Yeah, it's a good tune.  And what year was that a hit?  78.  Like 78, kids.  That was a while ago.  It's a good tune.  Oof.  Yeah, yeah.  Hopelessly devoted.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, see.  Oh, I know.  Oh, I know.  Wow. 
[02:46:30]  I want to say what she's singing to right now, but I won't.  I feel like I could just remove my penis and leave it at the door and turn in my card.  Same thing could apply to You're the One That I Want.  Yeah, yeah.  What a big hit. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  See, a lot of places, what I love about this show is a lot of places would have just played about five seconds of that.  Oh, no.  We keep going.  But we just let it go.  And for the trifecta, we could also do We Go Together.  Yeah, yeah.  Since we're still on that.  I'm looking at this song.  Let me see.  Yeah, let me drop it.  Born to Hand Jive.  Oh, God.  This is the original song, Grease, from the opening.  Oh, I forgot that one.  Why don't you play that? 
[02:47:30]  Frankie Valli, right?  I'm getting upset.  Where's it, Avalon?  Frankie Avalon.  That beauty school dropout?  Who didn't like that one?  Oh, yeah.  Of course I could even finish beauty school.  Fucking worthless.  She just killed herself.  Yeah.  Frenchie.  This is during a prostate exam.  Grease is the word.  Is this still Levy Newton-Johnson?  Yeah.  After the hormones.  There ain't no name you need to call me anymore. 
[02:48:00]  We don't believe in now.  Yeah.  It's a good soundtrack.  Fuck.  Boy.  I wish I could think of more wacky zany song parodies.  But now we're just playing the goddamn songs.  I know.  I'm about to go home and drink heavily.  Yeah.  And watch that slap, smacks, and pokes again.  I'm genuinely enjoying this.  Are you really?  Jimmy's a weird guy.  I like this. 
[02:48:30]  Jimmy's a weird guy when it comes to music.  You like Sabbath.  And then you could listen to this.  That would be good.  Sabbath does the soundtrack from Grease.  So Jimmy's in his glory right there.  Jimmy's in his fucking glory.  Yeah.  Look at me.  I'm Sandra Dee.  Ozzy could do.  We go together.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can we just please turn this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can turn off Iraq.  Who's got control of this right now? 
[02:49:00]  Iraq was digging it.  I was digging it.  Reminding of his Florida days.  Yeah.  Right?  He was a greaser and he would fight with the Sochers.  Oh, yeah.  And he had some Sochers crackers and he would eat those.  Maybe we can play the soundtrack now from Grease 2.  Could we go to that?  Oh, yeah.  Great.  I guess.  Oh, we got into that because the Magic Garden Girl was doing Sandy's role.  What the?  But she was.  It was when she's old.  Like recently she did that?  Yeah.  They were bringing the original cast.  They had like Barry Boswick playing Danny Zuko. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  And I think.  What the fuck?  The original.  Wilford Brimley.  That's good.  I got the diabetes.  Walter Bobby.  If you got a bun in the oven, well, you can do things about it.  I hope you don't just feel sorry for yourself.  Get an abortion.  And, of course, Jeff Conaway not doing well.  Yes.  The dead Jeff Conaway.  Yes.  What part did he play?  He was a.  Knicky.  Knicky.  Get a hickey from Knicky.  Good God.  Get a hickey from Knicky.  I just want. 
[02:50:00]  People should know you pulled that out without looking at anything.  You didn't do any research.  That's not a Knicky Hickey in the old age home.  It's just some angry orderly biting your chest.  What's up?  320 pound orderly.  Yeah.  All your kick and your little white shoes fall off.  This old bag is walking around saying she got a hickey from Knicky and it's just sarcoma.  Bed sores all over.  Really?  Did he give you hickeys only on one side of your body? 
[02:50:30]  Ethel?  Again.  You liar.  Here comes the orderly to slip your grease lightning.  Grease lightning.  Oh, grease lightning's coming again.  Shut up or you get the pillow.  It's not even a nice grease lightning.  It's literally just cooking lard.  It's not the good grease is what he's saying.  No, no.  It's not the good grease.  Not the good grease. 
[02:51:00]  Well, congratulations to her.  She still seems to be eking a career out as Long Island based as it may be.  You should get her on the show.  Oh, man.  I think I could get her.  Do we have to take the people from the electric company first?  Yeah, that's what it would be.  Yeah, other people.  Could you take the count first?  Yeah, we need to.  He's going to count on the show and then we might get the electric company. 
[02:51:30]  But you've got to take the second O in Zoom.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Zoom.  It's the Zoom people.  You've got to take the girl from Zoom that used to talk to the weird talk.  What was the weird talk?  I don't know.  Habba Bubba Wobby Bubby.  Ew, who remembers her?  I don't.  I don't.  And then they did that thing with their arms.  I don't remember Zoom.  I just remember the theme song rolled.  We're going to Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  Yeah, I know that.  We're going to Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.  No?  Yeah, I missed all that shit.  I missed all that shit.  And the address.  Write Zoom Z-O-O-M, Box 350, Boston, Mass O-21-34. 
[02:52:00]  Tell her what it was.  Yeah.  What was this?  Was this like that same time as the Banana Splits and Fraggle Rock and all that?  Yeah, Fraggle Rock.  Fraggle Rock was 80s.  Oh, okay.  Zoom.  Turn us up, Danny.  Or something.  Oh, man.  They're hippie kids.  Yay.  Weren't they Canadian?  All right.  Now your job is to find out where these kids are now.  Oh, man.  Drugs, drugs, drugs.  Prostitution.  Drugs. 
[02:52:30]  And running a tech company.  This show sucks.  Oh, what's she doing?  Yeah, what the fuck is she?  Oh, she's now dancing.  Ew, mora.  What the fuck?  Hey, Luis.  Luis does a little Spanish dance.  Luis probably got sick a bunch of years later and didn't know what it was.  Oh, so did David.  Oh, boy.  There's Bernadette.  That's the one that does the arms.  My name's Jake.  Oh, he's wacky.  Look at his cannon.  Uh-oh.  I know.  Leon.  Leon's doing a 25-year stint. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, got involved with the wrong crowd.  Oh.  Outdoor shots.  What was Zoom?  They all had cool stripes like Waldo shirts.  Yeah.  See that?  They're slapping in.  Dear Zoom.  Oh, this song's terrible.  This is going to be stuck in everyone's head.  Oh, I hope so.  Oh, man.  The truth on your side, Bubba.  Zoom's on your side, Bubba.  Enough with your Zooming. 
[02:53:30]  I know.  Who wrote this?  If any of the original Zoom kids are listening, please call.  Yes.  And if not, Danny, maybe you can see what happened to some of the Zoom kids.  Yeah.  Well, this says here, season two, cast two.  Particularly find the tragic stories.  Oh, yeah.  There were plenty of cast members.  Yeah, like a bunch of rotating kids.  Google Zoom suicides.  Hopefully a bunch.  Come on in.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Boom.  I think that was written by, his name was Chippy OneNote. 
[02:54:00]  Chippy OneNote.  That's a redundant, repetitive song, isn't it?  Zoom-a, Zoom-a, Zoom-a, Zoom-a, Zoom-a.  He's got updated photos of all 32 Zoomers.  Oh, man.  Zoom-a, Zoom-a, Zoom-a, Zoom-a, Zoom-a.  See, I want Sam to just understand technology.  How the internet is supposed to work.  Oh, shit.  Let me see David.  Go back.  Young David is, uh, season one.  Alyssa?  Alyssa.  Let's see.  All right.  Now.  She's a little freckle face, kind of. 
[02:54:30]  Well, she's still a little freckle face.  She's not bad.  She didn't change much.  Yeah.  How old is she?  Oh, boy.  David.  Looks like a fucking aborigin.  Is that his biggest teeth?  Or is he putting fake teeth in?  That's how to be fake teeth.  Yeah.  He just looks like some college bum.  Although, look.  You see?  You get the same teeth.  He chews gravel for a living.  Hey, I got to warm him down.  All right.  And, uh.  What?  David's mom, Mary, worked at WSB and still does.  That's a terrible fact.  Oh, here's Jared.  Oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  Jared, uh.  Jared's wearing it. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, he's with a girl.  He looks like his mom.  Probably a friend.  Yeah.  Could be his mom.  Looks like a thin Dane cook.  Oh, yeah.  What year was this update?  Uh, 2011.  The video was posted in 2010.  How'd they get them all?  I think it was all, like, MySpace.  What else are they doing?  Oh, it's their MySpace.  Oh, shit.  Jared passed away in a car accident.  I'll go back.  Fast Jared fact.  Oh, boy.  That was a terrible Jared fact.  December 28th, 2006.  Oh, man.  Age of 21.  And he was called Fast Jared? 
[02:55:30]  Wow, that's ironic.  Wow, he died in a car wreck.  Oh, he was zooming down the street.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez, that's terrible.  We're going to boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Kiko.  I hope Kiko's doing okay.  We're going to.  Bad stock.  Kiko works in a massage parlor.  Yeah.  Happy ending.  Yes, it will cause lava to flow over her knuckles for 40 more dollars.  Just don't tell the mama son. 
[02:56:00]  Ah.  Ah, shit.  Uh-oh.  We didn't get any fast Kiko.  Let's say.  Oh, no.  She's the first lady of the United States.  Oh, she's a baby mama.  She gave birth to a very wide-eyed child.  Yeah.  All right.  Looks pleasant enough.  Looks pleasant enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Enough pictures of her.  Exactly.  How many?  How mighty.  Nobody else?  Here's the fact.  She's a baby girl named Lila making her first Zoomer apparent.  Oh, wow.  She's the first one who was.  Okay.  So these kids are like 25, 26 years old. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Pablo.  Pablo.  Escobar.  No, he's worth $10 billion.  He became a Colombian overlord with kills in 1991.  He's on the no-fly list.  Yes.  He works for the Zeta cartel.  Uh-oh.  Zoe can't.  Yeah, this has got to be something in clerical work.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, that's funny.  No way.  Look at that.  But Zodie is what we call a three-haler.  Holy shit.  Zoe looked like she was going to be a dud. 
[02:57:00]  Zoe was a school guy.  That's Zoe Fax.  She turned out pretty good.  Holding money, too?  Uh-oh.  Oh, yes.  She probably had a boob job.  Whoa.  Nice.  That's a little risque.  I like that.  Oh, the season two ones.  This is the ones we just saw.  Yeah.  Caroline.  Caroline.  What happened to Caroline?  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait.  She's kind of a mess in a leopard skin fucking awful low-cut top.  She let herself go.  Yeah.  Definitely let herself go.  Fast fact.  Caroline's a fatso. 
[02:57:30]  All right.  That's...  Oh, there it is.  She's currently...  Curse on a YouTube channel.  Oh, no.  Oh, she's a host on a YouTube channel.  Yeah.  That's what happens to this.  Yeah.  Watching her career zoom down the shitter.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, asshole.  You guys suck.  You guys suck.  Stop.  Sirius XM.  Take a seat.  Stay in there.  Get on the phone.  All right.  They do know each other.  Get on the phone, brother. 
[02:58:00]  Holy shit.  Who kid was telling some stories today, Steve-O?  Yeah, me and you.  Who kid?  Pop one over to the right.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, dude.  You guys think I lied, but you know.  Well, you've always been a little bit liberal with the truth.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's cool, man.  I told him about the story with the kid rocking the room.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  That's fucking hilarious, man.  I'll never forget the size of that rubber I found in your bathroom after that. 
[02:58:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Big fucking Max.  Yeah, the serious fucking Magnum.  I looked at him and I was like, man.  I think Steve-O saw my dick.  No homo, but.  Was it all full of jizz?  Yeah.  Jacket.  Steve goes, yeah.  That is correct, man.  Did you eat it like space food?  Why would you use a rubber?  What's wrong with you?  I mean, I don't know.  I wasn't thinking.  What's that shit?  Yeah, have some dignity.  I was trying to be like, I was trying to be on some jackass shit. 
[02:59:00]  There's a difference there.  His kind of, they like to have the kids.  Oh, boy.  That could be a problem, right?  Steve-O pulls out.  I still can't believe all the rawness.  You don't have no children.  Yeah.  You're like the king.  You're like a pull-out king, son.  Pulling out is important.  Perfect timing.  You know how to time it perfectly?  Yeah.  I even like to be a little early.  You know?  Yeah, I'd be able to give myself some time to aim.  You know?  If you bang the girl, I swear to God. 
[02:59:30]  I timed you, right?  I timed him.  It was like four minutes and like 20 seconds.  Beverly Hills Hotel.  I timed you.  You banged her in my room.  Four minutes and 20 seconds.  God, you guys really do know each other.  Fuck.  I remember one time.  Oh, shit.  Here we go.  It was just kind of funny.  We were in Orlando filming Jackass No. 2.  And some kid came up to Knoxville and he was like, hey, man, I'm trying to get into acting.  Here's my idea.  I don't know.  He says, you just never do know. 
[03:00:00]  And so I want to give this to you.  And it was his headshot, this black and white headshot of this young kid, this dude.  And so we pulled that back to the hotel and I was like, hey, Knoxville, let me get that fucking headshot.  And I go, start timing.  I go, start timing.  And I went hauling ass, running up to my room, just so fucking fast.  Running up in the room, open up the door, ran, fucking jacked off, cummed all over this kid's face on his headshot.  And then came running back down to the lobby and slapped it onto the window of the hotel lobby. 
[03:00:30]  And it stuck there.  And I was like, what's my timing?  Because they were timing and it was less than two minutes.  I think it was more like a minute and a half.  And we were in that hotel for a good two weeks, I think.  And the burrito never came down.  That comes like wallpaper paste.  That shit's going to stay on that window. 
[03:01:00]  He's not making this up either.  I lied, but this guy's the truth.  Did he ever get into acting, the kid?  If I saw that kid, I'd recognize him.  He has not done shit.  Oh, fuck, man.  Now, Steve-O, you got a show.  Look at this.  We're seeing Steve-O on TV.  Yep.  Not hurting himself.  Right, not hurting himself.  Yeah.  Wow.  Regular old funny guy. 
[03:01:30]  Now, you've managed to combine.  Karaoke.  Karaoke.  That's right.  With fucking with people.  Sure.  People are singing karaoke while horrible shit happens to them.  Right.  And now, what's the object of this?  Like, you've got to continue singing?  It seems to be hilarious.  Oh, okay.  Like, just people are singing and they're getting electrocuted and, you know, they keep singing,  you know.  And whoever the audience likes from each round, there's six contestants per show, three rounds 
[03:02:00]  of competition, audience votes.  God, I'm boring.  I'm boring myself.  So, no, no.  Do they like audience votes and whatever?  Does the audience tend to like people that sing better or people that can go through the  shit and keep going?  Hey, I think that the audience is looking for commitment.  Commitment.  Commitment to song.  Commitment to performance.  Right.  Which is just like the voice.  So, if you can plow through.  He's killing, what's-a-day, Christina Aguilera. 
[03:02:30]  I don't know why he hates her.  I don't hate her.  I don't hate her.  She's just a fucking rude.  She's kind of cunty on that show, right?  Absolutely.  I can't remember because it was years ago, but I seem to recall her being kind of rude  and cunty to me.  Really?  But who wouldn't be?  When she was hot.  I'm an asshole.  When she was hot.  When she was hot.  When she was hot, probably.  She was fucking crazy.  She was hot.  She looks more and more like Snooki.  Oh, man.  That's the same person.  She's kind of getting fucking fireplug looking. 
[03:03:00]  I mean, the Texans you gave me yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a good time, man.  It was a good time.  What is that about?  You know what I know.  He just hints to everything.  Well, he texted me.  And I wasn't the one attacking X-Dina.  I texted who could yesterday.  I said, yeah, dude, I'm psyched to hang out tomorrow.  And he said, oh, I'm coming home.  I'm flying home right now.  Just got done doing the voice.  And I just wrote, how fat is Christina? 
[03:03:30]  Can't make this up, man.  She is.  And then he wrote, we texted each other simultaneously.  I wrote fatter than shit.  He wrote unbelievably fat.  But the thing is that we're not saying that.  I mean, she's like, she's rocking it now, you know?  She's wearing some, like, skin-tight fat shit, you know?  She's got some tit hanging out.  When she was doing that fucking video in the boxing ring. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, God.  Wow.  Fuck, that was hot.  I can't believe it's the same person.  It's hot.  It's amazing it's the same person.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well, whatever, man.  You feel bad about it?  No, I'm feeling bad about saying all that.  Yeah.  Don't feel bad.  But it's cool, you know, like, at a certain point, there's got to be some separation between  Steve-O and the other guy.  And you.  Steve-O's a wild asshole.  Right.  But entertaining.  Steve-O's entertaining.  Do you change your fuck tattoo to, say, rock when you're on TV?  Yeah, yeah.  Did I see that? 
[03:04:30]  Right, right, right.  It says, uh.  Or did I dream that?  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, rock.  I thought your knuckle said fuck, and I saw you recently.  I saw the show, actually.  Well, thanks, man.  I saw the one with the wheel where they're spinning around real fast.  Yeah.  And I'm like, wait, he turned his tattoo into rock for TV.  Oh, yeah.  So you can easily make that into an R and a R.  What does your shit say?  I save.  See, the H I make into an A, and that I turn into a V.  That's real shit right there.  Save rock.  Yeah, I did pick up on that.  I said a shit fuck.  Because I thought it was weird that you would just have rock on your knuckles.  I'm like, no, I think it was fucked. 
[03:05:00]  Right, right.  I thought that getting shit fucked tattooed on my knuckles would make me a legend.  Yeah.  And nobody fucking knows about it, man.  Oh, man.  When did you do it?  He got a dick on his arm.  Look at that.  October 2003.  That's gangster.  That's some real shit.  Why are you a gangster?  Yeah, what's the dick one?  Let me see.  Oh, yeah, you got the blood and the Crips tattoo.  Holy shit.  Yo, that's some two-part shit.  And I got Christina Aguilera.  Outline of a fat broad.  There's a silhouette of a fat broad sitting down tattooed on your side. 
[03:05:30]  What's the fucking, what's the, what's the idea behind that?  No, the fat broad.  Someone showed me a t-shirt.  It was like an obese mudflap girl.  And I just laughed and ran to the tattoo parlor.  How many you got?  It's only one, Steve-o, I tell you.  How many tattoos you got now?  Holy shit.  You know what?  A number is difficult to gauge.  I'd say maybe 25.  But some have been works in progress.  What's this on your line? 
[03:06:00]  Let's see if it's fading out.  Oh, this one right here.  I had a guy fucking a baby.  Yeah.  Like sodomizing a baby.  Yeah.  And I realized I crossed the line, so I went and I fucking, I blobbed, I would turn into  a black blob.  Okay.  And then it was like, then I turned the black blob into an ostrich.  Ostrich, so now it's a guy fucking an ostrich.  Yeah, you know it's a pretty rad tattoo when, when the cover up is a guy fucking an ostrich.  Who's the guy that we had in here that did that?  What the fuck?  Um, Eric. 
[03:06:30]  No.  The guy, the Miamian guy.  No, there's a, oh, help me out.  Good what?  One of the most famous stories.  He said, uh, fuck, a musician.  It's one of our legendary stories.  The guy said one of his road guys fucked an ostrich.  Really fucked an ostrich?  Oh.  Damn.  Ministry.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Al Jorgensen came in and told that wild story.  What?  I wasn't sure if you were talking about it.  Tattoo, tattoo removal.  No, no, no.  Tattoo or fucking an ostrich.  It was like fucking an ostrich was way down on the list there. 
[03:07:00]  Right?  Did you see that Crips and Bloods again?  Yeah.  Is that a problem, that tattooed, uh, who came?  Wow.  Nah, it's neutral, you know.  That's all right?  If he's a Crips nigga, you know, he's repping him.  If he's a blood nigga, he's repping him.  It's gangster.  Okay.  He was a nigga before.  He's still a nigga, right?  I think you can say that.  We gotta get the basics out.  I don't even know what channel this shows on.  It's a karaoke show, right?  True TV.  It is True TV.  Yeah.  Because we were just flipping around.  I saw it and I stopped.  I was like, I gotta check out what Steve was up to.  Well, thanks, man.  It's Friday nights at 9 p.m. on True TV. 
[03:07:30]  It's a good laugh.  Yeah.  You should have brought the dog collars and tested on Jim.  Ah, no.  I wouldn't do that.  I'm a baby.  I can't do that stuff.  Yeah.  You wouldn't let him shock you?  No.  No.  I would dislike that a lot, actually.  Discovered any real talents on there, the show?  No.  Local talents?  Nobody's getting a record deal.  No.  I guess it is like The Voice.  Oh, man.  You know, 50 was on there yesterday, man. 
[03:08:00]  But 50, it's different.  Road Tech.  All right.  It was Al Jorgensen's Road Tech.  Yeah, okay.  That was a legendary story.  Maybe you played in the 10-hour yard.  Now The Voice is cool, right?  Yeah.  Were you guys on The Voice that we went?  Yeah, we performed.  It was really good.  Oh, okay.  It's incredible.  What song?  There's a new song called My Life with Adam Levine and Eminem and 50.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Was Eminem there?  No, Eminem is going on Saturday Night Live, so I don't know.  All right. 
[03:08:30]  Is he?  When's he on SNL?  What does Emin have coming out?  He's working on it now, so I don't know.  This white bitch I fucked the other day told me I think a lot more.  Oh, man.  Now you're crossing the line like a baby fucking tattoo over here.  Detroit, baby.  Oh, man.  I dig the way you operate here, kid, man.  I really do.  I try to be like you, man.  How was that last time in Vegas? 
[03:09:00]  There was many times in Vegas.  Well, yeah, yeah.  But just recently, like, I had that pack of Canadian chicks.  Yeah, he gave me a bitch, too.  I love you, man.  Wow.  He gave me a bitch.  It was so random.  He said, yeah, you want this bitch?  I was like, wow.  He don't drink, no.  He don't drink, no drugs, nothing.  That's right.  He left the club.  I was shocked, but he still wants pussy.  I had to go home and park in the pink zone.  That was crazy, son.  You still doing all right?  How many did you bang?  I just, I was just one.  He had 10 Canadian bitches with him. 
[03:09:30]  He sent me a, he texted me the photo.  I was like, me as a nigga, I was like, yo, I'm coming there, you know what I mean?  And it was so funny because I had, like, 10 chicks with me.  And who could, he's like, okay, I'll come pick you up.  So he comes to pick me up in this, like, two-seat car.  And we made all the chicks take a cab and go do this.  Holy shit.  That's a real nigga shit.  That really is.  It was real, man.  Yeah, it was hilarious.  Holy fuck.  You doing all right with the drugs and the alcohol?  Yeah, man.  Still doing well?  Coming up on five years.  Jesus Christ.  That's amazing. 
[03:10:00]  That's incredible.  Fuck, man.  I appreciate that.  How about you?  February of 87, however long that is.  Wow.  It's 25.  It's coming up on 26 years.  Yeah.  26 in February, right?  Seriously?  Fuck, yeah.  Wow.  It's in a big team.  Mine's 3 a.m.  Yeah.  I'm too old to start, right?  I'm like 41.  Can I start now?  You'll just fall apart.  You better just keep fucking...  You're not a big partier?  I never did coke ever in my life.  Oh, man.  Just a little drinking.  I saw Steve-O did it and I was excited, but that's it.  Isn't it fun to even watch?  I wasn't exactly making it look good. 
[03:10:30]  Who's that?  Who's that chick?  I think I was...  Who the fuck's that?  I was one of the more effective tools in the war on drugs.  Atlanta?  Oh, it's one of the Housewives of Atlanta.  Atlanta.  I don't watch that one.  I don't even know her.  Who's that?  I watch the Jersey and the Beverly Hills.  I don't watch the fuck in Atlanta.  Oh, that's Tendi.  Her name is Tendi.  Is it Tendi?  No.  What? 
[03:11:00]  Kenya.  Kenya.  Tendi.  Oh, I'm excited.  I made that up.  Kenya.  I'm as glad as you guys.  I don't even watch that show.  No.  I don't know shit.  How you doing stand-up-wise?  It's been good, man.  You still doing it?  Yeah.  I've been doing it like crazy, man.  It's a good time.  I've been actually at the point where I'm going back to places like the second time on the  second loop around.  Right.  And that's kind of stressful because you want to have all new stuff.  I'm going back to places with like, I don't know, maybe 40% new and doing like 60% old. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's cool.  You approve.  I always feel kind of fucking lame about that.  You know?  I mean, you know, the old bits get better.  They genuinely do, you know?  And you shed them.  Once you shoot something, once you film something for a special, then it tends to go away.  Yeah.  Like, once you put it on film, then you're like, all right, I'm done with it.  Some people don't, though, right?  Some don't, yeah, I don't know how they can.  Some just keep fucking doing the same shit.  That's to me.  Once it's not a special, I don't know how you ever do it again. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  It's just tough when you, it's frustrating when you're like, I need to come up with new  shit, you know?  I got all deliberate about it, and I was like, fuck, you know?  And I started writing, like, you know, sort of, what's going on with me?  I'm thinking, oh, I'm fucking getting, like, I'm 38 now, and I think fucking God hates us.  And this is my whole new bit, is God hates us.  As a human race?  Well, no, I think our fucking existence is a cruel prank on us. 
[03:12:30]  Because how can you explain that we have one instinct, which is to survive, and one  guarantee, which is we won't?  Oh, shit.  You know?  That's pretty heavy there, Steve.  Yeah, I know, and it's really dark and fucked up, and I don't know.  That's pretty cool, though.  And we get old, and it's like, I think God hates us because, like, you know, fucking,  he picked humans to be the only living thing that can watch and have an opinion of itself  wilting, you know?  A fucking banana doesn't look in the mirror and think, like, getting some spots, you know? 
[03:13:00]  A fucking banana doesn't say, I'm bruising!  I'm bruising!  A fucking banana skin spot cream, yeah.  Yeah, a carton of milk doesn't look at the calendar and think, oh, my best before date's  creeping up on me.  That's true, but a banana has never had its cock sucked after a gig.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good shit, but anyway, I don't know.  Some real shit right there.  Some real shit right there.  It's so much better when you're talking about, like, three chicks sucking your dick and stuff. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, a little easier.  Yeah.  Damn.  Do you have a steady workout place?  I mean, for material.  Sure, man, I live a block away from the Laugh Factory now.  Oh, cool.  Okay, it helps.  Yeah, that's cool.  That place you just walk into and bomb when you need to, like, when she's good, that's  the way the new shit comes out, is just walk in.  Yeah, walk in there, bomb, or show up at the opening Anthony show.  Oh, are you kidding?  Yeah, dude.  No, but it's a good thing to do.  Walk in a club. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, just walk out at the fucking, you know, half the works, half it's...  It's actually funny.  I saw his first show.  Hilarious.  At Caroline's.  I was on the floor peeing on myself.  All right, Caroline's.  I remember when he did that one.  I appreciate that, who, kid?  I mean, you know.  That was an honor to have you there, man.  I didn't even tell him I was going.  I just, like, brought my mistress and shit, you know?  How did you guys meet?  It's crazy.  How did we...  We met back in...  I don't even remember, son.  It was July of 2004.  You remember that shit?  Yeah, because I remember the night before, I had done a show with Old Dirty Bastard.  Oh, that's when you stuck your dick on me and beat you up. 
[03:14:30]  There's no gainness with Wu-Tang, man.  No, I...  Oh, no, that was later.  That was later when...  That was a whole other story.  But, no, I was doing a show at the Hammersmith Ballroom, if that's what it's called.  Hammerstein.  Hammerstein Ballroom.  And they had, like, all different shows going on.  And I was on the same bill with ODB.  And I wanted to meet him so I could say, dude, I was in your jail cell, you know?  Like, because they told me when I was in protective custody at L.A. County Jail, they're like, yeah, you're on Robert Downey Jr. block. 
[03:15:00]  And, you know, ODB's always in here.  You're in his cell.  So I go into the room that ODB's performing in, and he's fucking smoking PCP on stage, sharing it with the crowd, with his fucking pants down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm not, like, I'm not even exaggerating.  His fucking pants were down.  I'm talking, like, uncircumcised.  Pants down.  You know?  Smoking PCP, sharing it with the crowd.  And I'm just like, I can't even fucking believe this. 
[03:15:30]  So I come, I walk my way up to the stage, and one of the people, like, in the screw, they see me by the stage.  They're like, no way, Steve-O, come on up.  So I get up on the stage, and ODB's on, and I have my little camera, because I wanted to get a picture with him.  And I'm making these little quick-time videos of ODB rapping.  And I made, like, three videos.  The first one, like, he's still rapping.  You know?  The second one, he's really slowing down.  You know?  He's really deteriorating.  And then the third one, the third one, he's just straight sitting on the drum riser, slumped over, still holding the mic and the joint of BCP, 
[03:16:00]  and just motionless.  Just passed out.  Holy shit.  This is like the sequence of videos.  And I just couldn't even believe it.  It was so fucking rad.  And the next morning, I'm still in New York.  The next morning, you know, I come over to be on G-Unit Radio with Who Kid.  Oh, man.  And I was telling the whole story, and I think, God, it was the wildest.  I was bugged out.  I was like, what the fuck?  It was the wildest.  Did you actually meet him that night?  I did not.  No, I didn't.  I was just on the, he was passed out by the time. 
[03:16:30]  And then I took off, so I didn't ever actually get to introduce myself.  What was your next interaction that Hookie was talking about?  I brought weed to the studio.  We rolled a joint.  The next interaction, that's a much juicier story.  This was after ODB passed.  It was summer of 2006.  They had the, what do they call that Wu-Tang tour?  Wu-Tang Forever.  No, no.  It was Rock the Bells.  Yeah.  Rock the Bells.  So Wu-Tang's headlining. 
[03:17:00]  I'm drinking all day.  They're taking forever to get on stage.  By the time we get on, I'm just fucking hammered.  And I've got this thing where, you know, I'm going to do this stunt during the tribute to ODB portion of the show.  Oh, shit.  And I'm telling Method Man, I'm like, I'm telling Method Man, it's going to be great, man.  I'm going to come on stage with you guys when you guys honor ODB.  And I'm going to fucking strip naked.  I'm going to fucking wiggle my balls and dick back and forth and catch them in like a mangina position, you know?  R.P. 
[03:17:30]  I call that the double back, you know?  I fucking thrust back and forth and I fling it all back and I catch it, you know?  And then once I've got it like the mangina, then I'm going to do a standing back flip.  It's called a double back back flip.  And so then, and Method Man, I'm telling this too, he's kind of cracking up.  And then I'm like, oh, okay, so it's going, I'm all drunk.  And then later he comes up to me before they go on.  He goes, dude, you can't do that.  You can't do that, dude.  They're going to fucking kick your ass, dude.  They're not cool with that because you can't do that. 
[03:18:00]  And I said, I said, let them kick my ass.  That's what ODB would want, you know?  Oh, my God.  And so I'm just hammered.  Oh, no, Steve.  So the time comes, they've got ODB's mom on the stage.  Oh, my God.  You know, they're doing the whole thing.  And in my defense, Method Man did hand me the mic.  I don't know if that's in my defense or not. 
[03:18:30]  But he handed me the mic.  And so, you know, I tell the whole story.  I was in jail and I was in his, you know, they said I was in a cell.  Now I'm going to do something for ODB.  You know, I'm going to get naked.  And so I strip off my clothes.  And on the foot, because I had someone filming it, everybody's still laughing.  Everybody had a sense of humor about it.  They're all like, oh, damn, this guy's crazy.  You know, and I flip my balls into my dick back and forth.  I do the back flip.  So everybody's laughing.  Everybody's laughing.  I didn't think you'd get that far.  Yeah, I did. 
[03:19:00]  I got that far.  Then they went into like Shimmy Yeah.  And then they played like Brooklyn Zoo.  Everyone's dancing around.  I'm all dressed.  I even gave ODB's mom a hug after the whole thing.  She said that I was the son that she never had.  It was like a touch and whip.  Where's Dicko?  No, I didn't know how to do that.  But then after like the two ODB songs, almost like as an afterthought, and I'm still out there  on the stage, all of a sudden, Raekwon, the Wu-Tang guy, Raekwon, he grabs me all violent 
[03:19:30]  by my neck and just drags me out to the center stage.  And he says, you know how his brother wasn't there to defend himself from that faggotry and  shit, you know?  Faggotry.  And something like that.  And like, you know, and like, and I'm going to apologize right now or he's going to knock  me out.  And he doesn't care if he goes to jail.  And I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Oh, you said you're sorry quick.  I said I was sorry so fast, man.  And that was about, I really did look like a bitch. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, man.  And Raekwon was like, you know, like the, what do you call it?  The fucking, he was a fucking gangster.  That's a consummate gangster.  He was a consummate gangster.  And then everybody, and then security said, hey, you got to get out of here or you're going  to die.  Wow.  So the, I'm shocked he didn't get his ass killed though.  He had 15 security guards like, I should be into like a car and got in.  He got fucking balls.  So I was really embarrassed about that. 
[03:20:30]  Literally.  Why did he get there?  I was genuinely, genuinely embarrassed about that.  Why did he do that?  Like that, why did he wait?  Why did he wait and do it as an afterthought?  I don't really know.  The part we're in shock.  Because you know, when black people see white balls, it's like a shock.  But you hugged his mom.  That was also Ray Kwan's mom, right?  No, that was.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  You don't think Ray Kwan's mom?  No, no, no.  Did he say, said by brother, he means.  No, no, no.  Right, right, right, right, right.  Oh, he wasn't saying that they're not actual brothers.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe they were actual blood brothers.  No, no, no, no, no.  It wasn't like that.  So it was annoying him while it happened. 
[03:21:00]  They call each other brothers, Jimmy.  I think it was annoying while it happened.  And then it just kind of built up.  And then all of a sudden he snapped.  Did you ever see him ever?  I think he was even extra angry when he got to me.  Because he didn't let it go.  He dragged me back.  He grabbed your neck.  Did you see him walking up to you?  That's the way it does.  Dude, did you see him walking up to you?  I did.  I didn't.  It was out of blue.  Were you laughing for a second because you thought it was a joke?  No, no.  I knew.  I knew that shit was.  He's moving oxygen.  I knew that shit was dead, dead serious. 
[03:21:30]  Wow, that's crazy.  So you apologized.  What was the crowd doing when you did that?  I apologize.  And I mean, I was just like the bitch on stage.  You know, I've had people come up to me and they're like, oh, dude, I was at that show.  Laughing.  Well, whatever.  In prison, that would have been a rape right there.  You know, I guess so.  You'd have been like, oh, yeah, fuck me, fuck me.  Have you seen him since?  Ray Kwan?  I haven't seen Ray Kwan since.  But I've seen him. 
[03:22:00]  I saw RZA since then.  Yeah.  RZA was in here.  Yeah, he was in here.  He's a cool guy.  Yeah, I saw RZA at the VMAs.  And I went up to him and I was like, hey, man, I really owe you an apology for that.  And he said, oh, come on, dude.  We're all cool with you, you know.  Hey, like, I'd love to see Ray Kwan and say something.  He's like the gangster of all Wu-Tang.  Yeah.  He's like the killer.  Ray Kwan is the real deal?  Yeah.  He's like, oh, my God.  He's tied.  I know.  I've known.  Like, he tied an artist.  Like, a famous artist.  Tied them?  Tied them up and held them and filmed them and everything. 
[03:22:30]  Why did he do that?  Why I'm saying it's an ONA, but for the black community out there.  Yeah, right?  I guess there's a certain artist that dissed him and then he kidnapped the artist, tied  him up and filmed him.  Who?  I'm not going to say the name.  Oh, man.  Give us a clue.  Was it Sherman Hemsley?  We're not brave enough to say it.  Write it down.  I'm not brave enough either.  No, just write it.  I just wanted to know.  So he kidnapped the artist who dissed him.  Was it a rap?  Was it an artist that we would be shocked to hear it?  Or was it like an actor who you wouldn't be surprised to hear it got pumped? 
[03:23:00]  You wouldn't be kind of shocked, but you'd be like, damn.  That's fucked up, man.  And he filmed him what?  What did he film him?  Tied up?  Probably.  Yo, man, you pussy.  Bitch-ass motherfucker.  You know, probably going to call me your daddy and stuff like that.  Just don't fuck with Rick Warren.  That's it.  But he did.  And he survived.  He was a survivor here.  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't my intention to.  I mean, like, you know, my heart was in the right place.  I guess my penis is in the wrong place.  Yeah, you're sticking balls in the wrong place. 
[03:23:30]  That makes sense.  Now I want to interview Ray Kwan.  Can you get Ray Kwan on the show?  I could definitely get Ray Kwan up here.  I would love to talk to him.  I would love to make it right.  Gangster.  I'd love to talk to him.  I'd love to make it right.  And I guess, like, as much as, like, it was embarrassing for me, and I definitely,  it hurt my feelings and all that, I got to give myself some props, because that was  a fucking crazy thing to do.  Method Man told me I would get my ass kicked, and I was like, fucking let him. 
[03:24:00]  I was like, let him, and I went through it.  I'm surprised he didn't crack you in the face when he had you.  That goes up there, I think, with one of my gnarlier stunts.  So none of the guys jumped in to help you when Ray Kwan grabbed you?  No, I was on my own.  And they didn't have a, my apology came pretty quick.  You should have filmed a segment for Wild Boys.  It all exists on video.  I want to see that.  It all exists on video.  That'd be great to see, right?  What is the number one stunt?  Oh, man, I don't know.  Like, my favorites, I would say, jumping out of an airplane with no parachute into the 
[03:24:30]  ocean.  What the fuck?  Injecting five ounces of vodka into my arm through an IV.  Right, I remember that one.  And getting strangled unconscious six times in a row.  Wait, what's the no parachute one?  I don't know if I know that.  It was on my first Stevo video.  It was a sea glider airplane, and it took off, and I jumped out with no parachute into  the ocean.  How high up were you?  The higher up, it was the safer. 
[03:25:00]  The lower is where you're going to get real whiplash, you know?  Oh, shit.  Or whatever.  How high were you?  I guess 45 feet, maybe 45 miles an hour or something.  Yeah, yeah.  It was doable, but it knocked the wind out of me.  I was, like, trying to scream for help, but I had no wind.  I'm like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you know?  I couldn't even scream for help.  Just from 45 feet?  Yeah, I mean, the plane's pretty fucking high, and the plane's flying, so when you  hit, your body's going to keep going when you hit the water.  I was flying the whole lane, and I landed on my side.  Did you have people that actually, like, did some math, or did you just go, ah, 45 feet 
[03:25:30]  sounds good?  You know, I don't know.  Like, I don't know.  But earlier that day, I had been car surfing on a car going 30 miles an hour and did a  flip off the car over a bridge while it was moving.  Oh, okay.  And we rented jet skis to film it for you.  So when we returned the jet ski, I told the jet ski guy, I was like, oh, dude, and check  out what we just did.  I pulled out the little screen on the camera and showed it to him.  And the guy looked at my stunt jumping off the car, and he says, dude, you've got to 
[03:26:00]  jump out of my plane.  Oh, no.  Because I've been flying this plane for years, and everybody's all asking me to jump out of  it.  And I haven't let anybody, but secretly, I don't want to fucking see that shit, and you're  the guy.  Wow.  And he was worried about me getting in, going into the, because there's that propeller on  the back, you know, and he was worried about that, and I was like, oh, I'll clear the propeller,  but I was worried about the water, because going that fast and from that high, like, the  water's like fucking concrete, you know?  How did you know you'd clear the propeller? 
[03:26:30]  Who says I'll clear the propeller?  Don't worry about that.  I looked at the plane, and I could just tell that, you know, I could push off, you know?  I knew I had that, but I was worried about hitting the water.  So the fucking pilot is filming this, it's basically a glorified fucking hang glider with  a fucking propeller on the back, you know?  So it's like a bar that he holds to fly.  He's got one hand on the bar, and he's filming with the other hand, with the camera backwards, 
[03:27:00]  filming backwards over his shoulder.  And, uh, my fucking coked-out bros, fucking, we're up for three days before this, right?  You know, they're filming with a VHSC camera from a jet ski.  I had no fucking reason to believe I would actually get the footage, but I couldn't turn  down the opportunity.  Did you get the footage?  Yeah, it came out perfect.  Wow, man.  That's some crazy shit.  I'm gonna go check that out today.  That's some crazy shit, Steve.  Yeah, that was on my first Steve-O video.  Damn.  Steve's done some fucked up shit. 
[03:27:30]  Yo, he fought a pilot one time on a private jet.  Yeah?  I don't know if I fought him.  I was just trying to hug him.  Yeah.  Oh, he's flying.  He's flying.  Yeah, it's probably an issue.  It took like me and, like, two other black dudes to bring him down in the plane.  Wow.  Because he was zeeked out of control.  Where were you going?  We were going from L.A. to Phoenix, right?  Right.  Good.  And he was, first of all, it was 120 in Phoenix.  I don't know.  I was like, I don't know if that was as much the issue, but, uh.  You hugged him while he was like, yo, like, the pilot was like, what's going on here? 
[03:28:00]  What's this white guy hugging me?  Like, it was crazy.  Oh, man.  The plane was like, oh, fuck.  Wait, are you trying to tell me the pilot was black?  No, it was a white pilot.  Oh.  Come on, man.  Let's be real here.  Jeez.  You want a white pilot, too, don't you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who are you doing in L.A. to Phoenix?  He was so zeeked up, I had to fly to L.A. to pick him up from his apartment.  Holy shit.  Because he ain't going to the airport by himself. 
[03:28:30]  I picked him up.  I was always pretty good.  If there was a check involved, I showed up everything.  You got your shit together, right?  Yeah.  I never promised what shape I would be in.  I never didn't get paid.  I'm not adding that he caught, like, you got a fire in the club.  I'm not even adding that.  Like, he's never getting booked at that club again.  What do you mean?  Why?  He did a fire trick.  It was just one of my stunts where I light myself on fire and blow a fire.  It's like a black party.  Like, you know, people popping bottles and then Steve-O wants to start a fire.  Did they love Steve-O's show? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, they loved it, but the promoter was running when the fireman came and all that shit.  I don't think he remembers that, though.  Do black crowds like Steve-O?  I imagine they would think he's...  They love him.  They would love him.  They love him.  They can't...  He walks in, like, the clubs, and they're just like, what the fuck?  Like, Steve-O!  Yeah!  People melting.  People melting like, yeah.  It's like mad black ooze everywhere.  Like, yeah.  It's crazy.  They love him, though.  I don't know.  They just don't understand that he's in front of them because he's bigger than life.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think...  I remember back in the mixtape days, because that was the reason why I first met Who Kid, was because he was doing a G-Unit mixtape, and it was called the Wild Boy Mixtape. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  You know, like Wild N' Out or something.  I had his old crew, bam.  I had everybody on the time.  It was the Wild Boy Mixtape.  He said, we had to get the Wild Boy.  So I didn't even know anything about it.  I just heard about it.  Do I want to be on a G-Unit mixtape?  I'm like, sure.  Who could have no expectations?  I mean, just like to get Steve-O and be like, hey, I'm Steve-O, and this is the Wild Boy Mixtape.  But I walk in there, right, and I just start popping off. 
[03:30:00]  I tricked him to beef with all our enemies.  It wasn't even a trick.  It wasn't even a trick.  I need you to say this right here.  It wasn't a trick.  I said, who do you guys have beef with?  And it was like, oh, you know, like, Joey Button.  And I was like, oh, I'm like, oh, fuck that guy.  You know, he's like, I'm just like, I don't even know who I'm talking about.  He's telling me like, I'm just like, oh, this is how he's a bitch.  I'll kick his ass.  And I'm like, just threatening the lives of all these scary rap people, talking about 
[03:30:30]  I'm a white nigger.  I was like, you need to read this right now.  Oh, man.  Wow.  I was just offering it up.  And I remember, like, I had this, like, this genuinely shady manager at the time.  Because it was early on.  Nobody cared about me.  And I had this, like, rave promoter from Cleveland.  He was like a pretty...  And he was, like, a pretty, like, serious street smart dude. 
[03:31:00]  I remember he's on the other side of the glass from the booth.  And I start saying I'm a nigger.  And, you know, with you, kid.  And I just remember this rave promoter manager guy, his face just turned white.  I was just like, really...  He had the fucking fear of God.  He melted, too.  He's like...  And then I start talking about, I'm going to kill this scary person.  Fuck that scary person.  It was pretty wild.  It definitely... 
[03:31:30]  I had a great relationship with the G-Unit after that.  Oh, yeah.  Sounds like...  How many times after that did you have to go, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Very good question.  Very good.  Oh, that's funny, man.  You were embarrassed in the moment when it was happening, even though you were drunk?  Or was it afterwards?  Oh, at the...  When Ray Kwan choked you, yeah.  It was very embarrassing right away.  Right away?  Yeah, it was embarrassing right away.  Dude, hearing the story, it sounds like it would be embarrassing right away.  Because it was such like, you know, the moment, it had like a good vibe to it. 
[03:32:00]  I kind of felt like, oh, you know, we're all on the...  It was cool, you know, like everyone was laughing.  I felt like it went really well.  And then that was kind of like, you know, it was kind of like giving back the Heisman trophy.  Giving back...  Being stripped of a medal.  Feeling all good.  What a letdown.  Yeah, I felt like a disgrace.  You were up there watching two more tunes, so you're like, God, that went fucking good.  Yeah, I'm part of the crew.  Yeah, I felt part of. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  All of a sudden, I was stripped of that.  And then he tested for roids.  That big fucking hand on your throat.  Is he a big dude?  Yeah, he's huge.  Yeah, Ray Kwan, he's a real pit bull, huh?  Yeah, he's like, yeah, literally.  Yeah, he described it in the right way.  Pit bull.  To be the badass in Wu-Tang.  That's pretty impressive.  He's called Ray Kwan the chef.  The chef.  Yeah, he's a cook coke and niggas.  He cooked the shit out of you, man.  I'm telling you, man. 
[03:33:00]  You're lucky you live, man.  Holy shit.  How do you spell his name?  I don't even know what he looks like.  That is lucky.  It's R-A-E-K-W-O-N.  Okay.  The chef.  They're from Staten Island, man.  All those guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Murderers.  Can you get me in touch with him, man?  I would love to.  I could do that, yeah.  I would love to talk to him.  I got a cell number.  We'd call him.  It'd be funny if he just choked you right off the bat again.  That's what I told you, motherfucker.  Right.  Shit.  You think he'd talk to Steve-O?  What a wild ass story, man.  That's fucking crazy.  I mean, I think that it's with utmost honesty that I'm telling the story. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  And, uh, you know, it is what it is, dude.  It's a cool fucking story.  Don't deny it.  That's the best celebrity story I've ever heard.  You got choked by a member of Wu-Tang at the wake of another member of Wu-Tang?  You're never going to beat that.  And the reason why is even better.  Oh, my God.  Fuck yeah.  Swinging his balls.  I got to say, though, I landed that double back backflip perfectly.  I mean, as a person fucking time. 
[03:34:00]  You were proud.  You were proud.  Lucky for you.  This is him, right?  This is the guy?  Yep.  Very evil guy, man.  Is he?  Still?  The chef.  The cook.  You know what I'm saying?  Rizzo was a nice guy, though.  He seemed nice enough.  He's a cool guy, yeah.  But he's white now.  But Rick Vaughn is like, that's the nigga, man.  That's the nigga.  He never went white.  Throw you in the pot, man.  It's over.  You know what I'm saying?  I got to fuck, man.  Some weird shit right there.  Let's be nice to him.  What's up with Lindsay Lohan?  You always protect her.  You still protect her?  I got fucked, man. 
[03:34:30]  Since I got sober, I haven't heard from her.  You used to protect her.  That was your bitch, man.  What are you talking about?  I don't know if I used to protect her, but she was always cool with me.  Paparazzi.  You were beating up paparazzi for her one time.  That was Paris Hilton.  Oh.  Yeah.  So Paris Hilton, too.  Did you get her new record?  Well, no, but I heard about her.  Sam loves it, man.  Sam.  Yo.  I don't know what's wrong.  White people like this.  Wait, there's too much going on here.  What's going on?  No, I want to know the Lindsay Lohan stuff.  Well, was it Lindsay Lohan?  Did you used to party with her?  Yeah, we partied a bunch of times. 
[03:35:00]  We did, we.  There was a...  You know some shit, right?  Yeah, I had her over in my apartment at one point.  Yeah?  And I was working on this video project where it was like me inundating celebrities with  my stunts and antics, you know?  I went everywhere with a video camera, and I had 50 Cent launch me down all these stairs  at the Palms Casino in a bellhop cart, and he did it three times in a row.  That was fucking fucked up.  Did you get hurt?  No, not when I didn't.  But then I tried to reenact that stunt for Jackass number two, and I was out for half 
[03:35:30]  the fucking movie with a back injury.  Holy shit.  But yeah, so anyways, I'm trying to film celebrities all the time.  I get Lindsay Lohan over to my apartment, and we're just visibly fucked up, you know?  She's on my sofa, and I just kind of pull out my camera, and I'm filming myself, and  I go, I said, well, you know, man, you better not fuck with Lindsay Lohan, because if you  do, I'll tell someone to kick your ass, you know, whatever.  And then I pan over, and I pan over, and there she is on my side, so it was like a reveal. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  And she's like, oh my god, I can't believe you're filming me, you know?  And so I had this video footage.  Well, a couple months went by, and she was actually wound up in rehab, you know?  And I'm in my bathroom, and I look under, like, there was a counter, and the top of  the upper tank of the toilet is hidden under the camera, or under the counter.  And at some point, I don't know why, but I looked under, I was probably looking for  drugs, I look at her, I see this fucking wallet. 
[03:36:30]  Turns out she had left her fucking wallet in my bathroom for like two fucking months.  Jesus.  Right?  Her wallet was in my bathroom for like two fucking months.  So here's what I do, I got this fucking video footage, right?  I fucking call her up, I'm like, hey, I just found your wallet in my bathroom.  Right?  And she's like, oh, thank god.  I'm like, she's like, bring it over to the rehab.  So I go over to this fucking rehab, and I make her sign a release form for the video footage.  I mean, I wouldn't give her a wallet unless she signed on. 
[03:37:00]  I signed so that I could use their fucking video footage.  Holy shit.  What are you shitting?  Did you use it?  I never used it.  I never put out that project, you know?  When you walked up to the rehab, did they hit an alarm like fucking, like a submarine going  down?  Like, get extra people in here.  Steve-O's coming.  It wasn't like that.  It was, she was out shopping for the day, and I met her at the gate as she drove back 
[03:37:30]  into the rehab.  What kind of rehab lets you go shopping for the day?  I don't think it took.  Was she pissed that you were?  She wasn't pissed, and she wrote, she signed her name like really beautifully.  Nice.  You know?  You get a little action?  I got Paris, no, no.  You didn't get anything off her?  I got Paris Hilton to sign a release for him at her house at a party.  She invited me to.  She invited me to her apartment or living room, and I whip out there.  Hey, will you sign this?  Who's the most famous girl you ever fucked? 
[03:38:00]  Oh, I don't know.  He's probably not going to say.  But there has been, right?  Someone?  Wow, we just shut Steve-O on.  That's what it takes to shut him up.  Ixnay on the...  We didn't have a good time with Paris.  You never fucked Precious.  Singer, movie?  Yeah, you never fucked Precious?  I think you did, though.  Fucking Precious.  Yeah, that's what we should be asking, though.  The worst one.  What was the worst one?  You didn't have a black cheek, I'll tell you.  You didn't have a good time in Paris?  No, no, no.  With Paris. 
[03:38:30]  When she came in here?  Yeah, we did not hit it off with her, unfortunately.  Oh, yeah.  She didn't really fuck her.  And we tried.  When was it, though?  When was it?  Not long ago.  I gave her a bit of a talking to her.  And I wasn't that brutal to her because she wasn't being mean.  And she was just being very not revealing and standoffish.  It was when she was doing the reality show.  She's being aloof.  We were on our best behavior, Steve.  We were really nice to her.  The reality show, the one that didn't do very well.  Yeah, not really.  Well, I mean, you got to understand.  We didn't even ask a bad question.  No, not enough.  And nobody was trying to be shitty to her.  We really weren't. 
[03:39:00]  Like, we've been shitty to people.  You got to figure that, you know, like, here's how it is, man.  You know those fucking things where the four balls are hanging.  You pull back one ball and it's like three balls down and it shoots off.  She had something else bothering her.  And it was just you guys that came out.  Oh, we were the fucking...  That's accurate.  I could see that that was...  You know, I mean, she probably wasn't in a good mood, you know.  We could have helped her out, too, man.  Believe it or not.  I mean, think of it this way, man.  We could have made that show a little more interesting than it was, I think.  Think of it this way. 
[03:39:30]  Kim Kardashian used to be...  She used to be fucking, like, Paris Hilton's, like, assistant or something.  Right, yeah.  Kim Kardashian used to organize Paris Hilton's closet for her.  Is that what she did?  Yeah, that was, like, among her duties or something.  And they don't talk anymore, right?  No, no, no.  Because Kim became the thing.  Right, so, I mean...  Push Paris Hilton right out of the way.  It's pretty unbelievable.  Wow, I didn't know she did that.  Oh, yeah, there was a cunt world out there.  Paris...  I know a little bit about this.  Paris Hilton...  I couldn't believe it.  Paris Hilton was the one that introduced Kim Kardashian to the world. 
[03:40:00]  Yeah.  And the paparazzi...  Was it Ray J the one who introduced Kim Kardashian?  Well...  Well...  That's that nigga.  But she came...  Paris...  She started hanging out with Paris Hilton and the paparazzi were like, well, fuck this.  Who's this broad?  Why doesn't she help Paris now?  If Paris was nicer, would she have helped her out?  Or, like, why didn't she...  I don't think Paris Hilton needs the help, really, right?  She's a DJ now.  Yeah, she's just doing her thing.  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  Remember, she runs all those businesses.  She's a businesswoman. 
[03:40:30]  Remember, Jimmy?  She does.  Yeah, I mean, she's doing all right.  But I just think...  She sat here like this.  She goes, I rent businesses now.  She was bad.  Yeah, she really was not pleasant.  And I was trying really hard to be nice to her.  We did try.  By the way, it's not...  They're saying you have to do rock radio.  All right, cool, man.  Well, hey, dude.  It's a fucking pleasure to be here, guys.  Yeah, you're doing great, man.  We're happy for you.  Really happy.  You too, buddy.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I guess we're done, huh?  Yes, and Who Kid, thank you.  Who Kid, what the fuck, man?  Definitely.  Who Kid, always a fucking pisser. 
[03:41:00]  Who Kid with his fucking huge cock?  Is he really packing Who Kid?  He's got a huge fucking cock.  Oh, you missed that part of the story?  How big is it there, Who Kid?  Down there?  What are you packing?  Water bottle?  What do you got?  I don't know.  I didn't see it this morning, but it kind of grew a little more.  I'm like 14.  Be careful, Who Kid.  With his fucking condoms.  Get my dick out of here.  Crazy person.  All right, we're out of here.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Baby gift ever.  Oh, the fuck is that? 
[03:41:30]  So I got home yesterday, and my wife's like, blank.  Her name will be blank.  Our cleaning lady.  Oh, okay.  She goes, hey, I got a gift from blank.  I go, oh, that's nice of her.  And it is nice that she thought of us.  Mm-hmm.  And I go, what'd she give us?  And she showed me, and I had to bring it in today.  It's toasted bread in a bag.  It's a bag of toast.  She gave you a bag of toast. 
[03:42:00]  Now, I've been poor still most of my life.  I've poor.  Done very well.  I've poor.  Last decade or so.  Sure.  But when you really add up the years, I've been poor most of my life still.  More than not.  More than not.  Yeah.  And times got bad.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of macaroni and cheese over the years.  Mac and cheese and trees.  On a hot plate.  That type of shit.  A lot of pasta, because it was cheap. 
[03:42:30]  Uh-huh.  Fucking Pepperidge Farm day-old bread.  Pepperidge Farm remembers what crappy bread tastes like.  Hey, Pepperidge Farm bread.  Margarine and sugar sandwiches.  That is true.  I've been there for more years than not.  I've never seen fucking toast in a bag before.  I didn't even know this existed.  And for some reason, I guess she said this is her favorite thing, so she wanted to kind  of share one of her favorite things with us. 
[03:43:00]  One of her favorite things is...  A few of my favorite things.  Toast in a bag.  What the fuck is toast in a bag?  I stared at this bag, and my brother-in-law is up visiting, and he can back me up.  I stared at this bag for at least 20 minutes yesterday.  I couldn't wrap my head around it.  Trying to figure out.  I don't get it.  I don't either.  You should get your cleaning lady a toaster and blow her fucking world.  Yeah, but I even said last night, when we were just all sitting around talking, 
[03:43:30]  I'm like, even when I was extremely poor, I always had a toaster.  And dude, that is such a Pillsbury knockoff.  Of course it is.  It looks like the Pillsbury Doughboy on there, but it's a bear with a cook hat on,  a white, like a polar bear baby cartoony thing.  You can poke its belly.  Definitely poke the belly.  And the colors on the package and the font and everything is all...  Well, yeah, that...  And the problem is, I'm handling this bag very carefully.  I really have been.  Gingerly.  And it's just crumbling inside. 
[03:44:00]  That is a crummy gift, both literally and figuratively.  The company's called Bimbo.  Bimbo.  B-I-M-B-O.  So when I tweeted this picture on my Instagram last night, that's why I love doing what we  do, because you learn.  So many people said Bimbo is a company that sells to, I guess, Mexicans.  Oh, really?  It's a Mexican company.  I did not know this.  That's the Mexican Pillsbury.  Yeah.  So I'm looking at the toasted bread.  The bread born toasted is their slogan by the company Bimbo. 
[03:44:30]  It's a new product, Anthony.  Oh, it's a new product.  It says new.  New.  Toast.  It's original.  I don't know if you could claim originality on toast, but they are.  I invented toast.  Before toast.  Bimbo toast.  That was me.  Hoo-hoo.  What else can I say about this?  There's a serving suggestion.  Put on plate.  Eat.  No, the serving suggestion is peanut butter and jelly on top of your... 
[03:45:00]  Jelly or jam?  Toasted bread.  E-Rock, comment.  It looks like jelly in this case.  Oh.  There's 14 slices per package, and the expiration date is December 12th.  What kind of bread are they using that it's going to survive until December 12th?  Wow.  She just got it.  So they're basically saying you could have this laying around your house for two months  before you got to throw it away.  And they say caution.  It's a big caution thing at the bottom here. 
[03:45:30]  It says caution.  What could be dangerous about toast?  Ready?  Yeah.  Do not microwave.  Why not?  Why?  Well, we're going to find out, because I think I got my viral video.  It's...  I'm going to fucking toast.  I'm going to microwave the toasted bread.  What could possibly...  It says...  Wait, wait.  Read that exactly how it's written.  It says, like, caution.  What does it say?  Caution.  Do not microwave.  Caution.  Do we have a microwave here?  Yeah.  What could be dangerous about microwaving toast? 
[03:46:00]  I bet it catches on fire real quick.  Yeah, there's no moisture.  Let's do this.  There's no moisture whatsoever.  Yeah, but is that...  Yeah?  You think it starts on fire?  It's like microwaving paper.  Well, I don't think that would do anything, would it?  No.  E-Rock, you're like...  You are America.  You are a consumer.  Oh, he's the consumer.  Have you ever heard of toasted bread in a bag?  I saw it a couple months ago.  They have a huge display of it.  Like, it's the best thing ever at some supermarkets. 
[03:46:30]  Nobody buys it.  It's never empty.  Is it down on that bottom Mexican shelf in the fucking supermarket?  You know how all the Mexican shit's down at the bottom shelf?  Those Goya beans.  The big fucking...  Like, the sack that you see over a burrow's fucking back of beans.  Pre-cut pitas.  Yeah.  And that fucking Goya juice shit.  They don't get good placement on the...  Horrible placement.  It's...  Every bit of it is by your wheels.  When you're fucking wheeling down the aisle. 
[03:47:00]  I'm not trashing this lady.  Because we do love her.  Well...  But I had to bring it in.  Good cleaning lady.  Horrible gift giver.  Yeah, terrible gifts.  I had to bring it in.  Bimbo bread.  I don't really understand this.  Are you going to microwave it here?  What does bimbo mean in fucking Spanish?  Does it mean anything?  Toasted bread.  Is it?  I doubt it.  Anything?  No.  G?  G?  What does it mean?  Type it in.  You're half fucking Mexican or something, aren't you?  Half black, half Mexican?  What are you?  It doesn't mean anything. 
[03:47:30]  Serving size.  It means nothing.  Nothing.  It apparently means eat my ass.  Either that or she's just telling me to eat my ass.  Ready for this?  Yeah, why?  The serving size, one slice is a serving.  Oh.  One piece of toast.  I'm full.  Well, fucking call me full.  I've had a slice of toast.  Don't microwave.  No.  And the percentages of daily value, there's a lot of zeros. 
[03:48:00]  It's just...  Yeah, that could be nothing.  There's a lot of nothing here.  So I had to share this.  I don't know what else to do with it.  What are we doing in the microwave?  Bimbo owns Wonder Bread.  Yeah, they also own Thomas' English Muffins.  What?  Bimbo?  Yeah.  No way.  They do not own English Muffins.  No.  It's the same company.  They do not.  Arnold's Bread and Thomas' English Muffins are owned by Bimbo?  Mm-hmm.  Or, you know, the same company owns Bimbo and Thomas' English Muffins. 
[03:48:30]  All right, look, look.  That's a big difference.  And Arnold's Bread.  The same company that owns Bimbo owns Thomas' English Muffins.  You're not saying Bimbo owns Thomas' English Muffins.  Not necessarily.  It's just under the same corporate umbrella.  Yeah, correct.  Stop it.  Is there a big tie on it?  Big controversy.  I don't know.  People are asking.  They also make Entenmann's Cakes and Sara Lee.  No, they don't.  It's under the same corporate umbrella.  Yes.  Are you going to put it in a microwave here?  Yeah, we can.  I hope so.  Do we have a microwave we can bring in the studio? 
[03:49:00]  No, but Obi can get on a phone.  What do you mean, no?  I'm not getting on a phone.  What is this?  Fucking Jacktober?  Yeah, what do you?  We could send Sal down to unplug the microwave in the kitchen and walk it in here.  That's what I'm saying.  Let's bring a microwave in here.  Who cares?  It's still early.  Sal might start using it as a wallet.  You know, to just be ironic.  They're pronouncing it wrong.  Now, what do you mean?  What?  It spells Bimbo.  How the fuck do I...  How do you pronounce Bimbo wrong?  Yeah, how do you pronounce it wrong?  If it's spelled Bimbo, I'm American, goddammit. 
[03:49:30]  Sarah.  Sarah.  Hi, hi.  It's pronounced Bimbo, and there's a whole commercial.  You should play the theme song.  It's ridiculous.  There's a commercial?  Oh, yeah.  Bimbo.  Bimbo.  But it's spelled Bimbo.  But they say it like, hey, this is a Bimbo.  Everyone's saying it's Bimbo.  I'm sorry.  I've never heard of this company before.  They don't spell it like Bimbo.  Wait, does Bimbo make Nutella chocolate?  Do they?  I don't know.  Jamie from Puerto Rico checking in. 
[03:50:00]  He's a regular.  He would know.  I don't like that Nutella shit.  I tried it.  Not a fan.  Not a fan.  Yeah.  Not a fan.  But I do like that chocolate stuff you fucking pour on ice cream, and it makes a chocolate  shell.  The shell.  How the fuck did they figure that out?  That's got to be some evil chemicals.  That's like fucking Carvel used to do that.  You'd get the cone, and then they'd put the chocolate shit on it, and it would crack.  It's amazing, though.  How does it fucking do that?  I know the ice cream's cold.  I get it, but. 
[03:50:30]  They called it chocolate bonnet and a cherry bonnet.  I remember the cherry bonnet.  Could I have a cherry bonnet, and it was like ice cream cone with that cherry chocolate  shit on it?  We just saw it from afar growing up.  Oh.  We were too poor to go to Carvel.  Did you have a knockoff?  Like, we just buy some generic cones and bad ice cream.  We had knockoffs.  Oh, did you have ice milk?  You'd buy ice milk and put it in a fucking knockoff cone.  It's just like Carvel.  Nothing worse than a knockoff of something you love when your parents would just tell 
[03:51:00]  you it's just as good, and it never was just as good.  Nothing beat fucking Carvel.  Fucking nice, big, large cone with some sprinkles on it.  Carvel ice cream was just the creamiest shit.  It was great.  You like creamy ice cream?  I love a good creamy soft serve.  Um, I...  Oh, it's great.  I'm not a fan of the soft serve for the most part.  Oh, Mr. Softy Truck would come around?  Yeah.  Oh, you'd fucking sit...  You'd walk behind the Mr. Softy Truck?  Are you being a hipster, or are you helping us out? 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, what is that?  Now I'm confused.  Is that like a fucking accessory?  You walk around with a microwave?  A microwave and a headband.  Go to Williamsburg.  You'll fit right in.  She's just walking around with a microwave.  Oh, by the way, Sam, we learned it's beanbow.  It's beanbow.  Beanbow.  And apparently there's a commercial if you can find it.  Yes.  I'm being told they bought Thomas' English muffins and all that stuff.  No, they didn't.  So they do, in fact, own it.  So what?  They're going to have...  I don't believe it.  So they're going to have toasted English muffins in a bag soon?  I hope so.  Let's go to the beanbow commercial, Sam, please. 
[03:52:00]  Yeah, beanbow.  B-I-M-B-E-R.  Look for the beanbow bear.  Look for the beanbow bear.  Never heard of this company before.  This is making a nice sandwich.  Putting it in a...  Lunchbox?  Hold on.  Pause.  Fact for goodness, Sam.  I like the song.  Not for me.  People are saying the toasted bread will melt in the microwave.  Yeah, right.  Melt.  I don't believe it.  We got a microwave here.  Do I really have to open up my toasted fucking bread? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Look, it's one of those bags.  It's like the egg noodle bag.  Yeah.  Can we talk about the egg noodle bag for a second?  All right.  Do you cook egg noodles ever?  I don't cook them, but I have, and I've seen them.  And you try to open it up carefully, and the whole bag...  Rips down the side, and all the noodles fall out.  Thank you.  Yeah, been there.  People know what I'm talking about.  Absolutely.  Why can't they fucking make the egg noodle bag better?  Come on, Bimbo. 
[03:53:00]  But Bimbo is using the same type of bag, because, look, I barely opened it, and it's ripped  halfway on the side.  Well, you're opening the toast.  Can I hear the Bimbo song?  Oh, sure.  All right.  Let me hear the Bimbo song.  In love, that's what Bimbo bread is made of.  Isn't it nice to know, slice by slice, that something nutritious can be so delicious, too?  It's...  It's...  What?  Oh, wow.  Smell this.  B-I-M-B...  It's horrible. 
[03:53:30]  Ew!  Dude, it smells like cardboard.  That's terrible.  I don't think you could have a dryer thing in your hands.  This is so dry.  Dude, it's crumbing.  Look at your heads.  I'm just holding it.  This is terrible.  All right, where's the microwave?  Hold on.  Over here.  Oh, wow.  You break it.  It's just dust.  Holy shit, I'm covered in dust.  This is insane.  You got asbestos on you.  Fuck, I got mesothelioma from this bimbo toast. 
[03:54:00]  You got to call that lawyer.  He's looking for cases, that ghoul.  Have you been in contact with bimbo bread?  Beanbo?  Wow, that's bad.  People are saying I'm stealing Fezzy's brown paper bag story.  I thought he took that one from you.  I remember that from many years ago.  So what do we do?  This shit's terrible.  Let's put it in the microwave, Sam.  Yeah, microwave it like it says not to.  And Sam, if you could give us a blow-by-blow description when it's microwaving. 
[03:54:30]  Who wants to star in my viral video?  Just bimbo.  You're the face of Apple 5.  I don't know if I want to use you.  Yeah, I'm already an established.  It depends.  Are you looking to build a new star, or are you looking to take my brain and hopefully  further your video around?  Cock.  Oh, man.  We took some bimbo bread, and I put it in a microwave, and I don't know what it did.  Let me move over to Jimmy's mic. 
[03:55:00]  Jimmy's in where, Vegas today?  Bimbo.  Bimbo.  The dust coming off of that is crazy, right?  Yeah.  You need a dust mask.  Isn't that going to melt the chair or something?  With it being right on there?  Oh, E-Rock.  What do you think?  It heats up?  It's a fucking microwave oven.  It's not going to melt the chair.  It works with microwaves.  That's imitation of it.  It's a oven of the future, they call it.  I think my, uh, don't break it before we do it.  Look at the dust that comes off of it. 
[03:55:30]  I think my brother just got a new car, because he just wrote me, he goes, what channel are  you on, Sirius Radio?  Oh.  Oops.  We're not on a channel on Sirius Radio, right?  Best of Package?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That stinks.  That's the next thing we're going to work on around here.  Exactly.  Dumb idea.  Come on.  Just put us on everything.  Everything.  All right.  Just bimbo.  Are we going to try this?  Put some bimbo bread in the microwave, because-  Wait, do you want to set this up, Ant?  Well, uh- 
[03:56:00]  Hold on, hold on.  One, two, and we're rolling.  Hi.  Uh, if you look over there, there's bimbo toasted bread.  It's toasted-  I don't like how that-  Hold on a minute.  I'm directing.  Oh, okay.  Fuck the radio show.  You've got to be holding the-  All right, I should be holding the toasted bread.  Right.  All right.  Hey, it is Friday.  You're lucky we're even here today.  Exactly.  Shut up.  All right.  All right, wait.  All right, show the camera.  All right, go.  Hi, uh, this is bimbo toasted bread.  It's toast in a bag, which is crazy enough, but, uh, who would think that there's, um, 
[03:56:30]  a caution, do not microwave warning on it?  So, I guess we're going to see what happens when you do, uh, microwave, um, bimbo toasted  bread.  Um, Sam's-  Oh, man, I like how this-  Sam's putting it in.  I hope something happens.  I don't know why it's so dangerous.  Do we have a fire extinguisher?  Um, oh, boy.  The- the- the microwave is precariously perched on, um, on a- a little lounge chair. 
[03:57:00]  A lazy boy recliner.  30 seconds to do it.  30 seconds?  Yeah.  And there it goes.  All right.  Uh, is it rotating?  Is it a rotating microwave?  It's rotating.  It's rotating.  And one of those, uh, yeah, it's rotating.  We're about, um, 10 seconds in.  There are no flames to be seen just yet.  No flames, nothing happening.  It's very dry bread, and microwaves work off of, uh, moisture.  They actually agitate the, uh, molecules.  You're kidding me.  And, uh, and because of the friction between the molecules, it heats up, uh, the- the food. 
[03:57:30]  Um, since there's no moisture in that, I would just think nothing happens.  But a caution is kind of silly.  There's the- the little signal that it's- all right.  What do you got?  Touch it.  Yeah, take it out.  Is it hot?  It's slightly warmer.  It's slightly warm.  Wow, that's dangerous.  Oh, God.  Worst viral video ever!  Back to the drawing board for the opes. 
[03:58:00]  Oh, well, maybe you could put it up as, uh, the viral video, but then put the basketball shot.  I wouldn't do that.  Up there.  That would not be nice to the people out there.  That would work.  What if we just put it in for, like, 10 minutes, and we just continue to do the show?  That's a good idea.  And then if something happens-  That's a great idea.  Should I just throw 10 minutes on the microwave?  Yeah.  Yeah, let it rip with 10 minutes of a high-power nuking of the-  A-beam-bow bread.  A-beam-bow.  A-beam-bow.  Oh, he's putting it on the floor.  Just in case. 
[03:58:30]  Just in case?  Why just in case?  What if the whole thing blows up?  How's the-  Microwaves don't blow up.  I don't think a microwave's ever blown up.  Wow.  Slamming the door.  Sam's a little pissed.  He really is.  What's going on here?  I think he's representing the listeners right now.  He really is.  All right.  There we go.  10 minutes.  10 minutes.  The bimbo bread's in there.  And this mic will be for the mic.  All right.  Jimmy's mic is as close as it could get, which is still 10 feet away.  All right.  But I guess if something happens, we'll know.  You were very good in the video.  Oh, good.  But unfortunately, no one will see it.  I know. 
[03:59:00]  It's not.  You know, I'm on the cutting room floor at the Opie Studios.  At Opie Lou Studios.  Right.  I didn't make that.  Viral video studios.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Shut up, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  I will catch you someday.  I will catch you someday.  Well, why don't you just put a guy from iPhone video microwaves bimbo bread?  Well, that would kind of be good.  And then you could tie it.  You could use his.  That's a bad idea.  Yeah.  And then I write microwaving toast for no reason. 
[03:59:30]  Okay.  It's smoking.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  It's smoking.  Wait.  I can maybe.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  What's it doing?  It's smoking.  Dude, dude.  It smells burnt.  Move.  Dude.  Oh, man.  I can't believe you missed it.  Move.  I'll displace this in.  Dude, that was under a minute.  What happened to the.  Oh, you only did 30 seconds.  Right.  Why don't you turn off the microwave?  Because there's smoke coming out of the back of it.  Turn it back on.  Turn it back on.  You've got to do it.  I'm not doing it.  You've got to push start.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  It's smoking like crazy.  Oh, my God.  Dude, it's going to start on fire. 
[04:00:00]  It's definitely going to start on fire.  Do we have a smoke detector in here?  Yes.  We're going to get in a lot of trouble.  Dude, it's going to start on fire.  All right.  We need a fire extinguisher.  Holy shit.  It's smoking like crazy.  I got some seltzer.  You're right above the smoke detector.  No, I'm touching it.  Don't fucking throw water on it.  Oh.  It's a microwave.  Just open the floor.  Hit stop on the microwave.  Hit stop on it.  Dude, it might flash fire if you open it.  It might flash fire.  Don't open it.  It's going to roll over on you.  Did you ever see fucking those movies?  Don't open it.  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, my God.  It's smoking like crazy.  Oh, my God.  Can you open this?  Oh, my God.  Everyone get on the floor.  Lay low.  Lay low.  Oh, cool.  We got a fire extinguisher just in case.  It burst into flames.  Holy fuck.  Danger.  Do not microwave the bad toast.  See?  They were right. 
[04:01:00]  Holy shit.  It's fucking smoky as hell in here.  And it reeks.  Where does it say that again?  Right there.  Caution.  Oh, God.  Do not microwave.  All right.  I foresee us getting in big trouble now for smoking.  Yes.  Yes.  I foresee this not ending well as far as management goes.  Oh, God.  It stinks in here now.  It smells like a fire.  Well, we probably weren't even supposed to take the microwave down from upstairs.  Oh.  Oh.  That was Salvo.  That was Sal for the record. 
[04:01:30]  Just put the microwave back and make believe it didn't happen.  What happened?  I want to know the science behind that.  Why did it burn?  We're going to get the smell out of here by having Sal bring the microwave back up with  the beanbow still in it.  With the beanbow.  A beanbow.  Oh, Troy from...  Oh, Troy.  Troy's waving his hand.  Troy, what happened?  Troy, we can't be in trouble for this, right?  The whole hallway stinks.  My studio stinks.  Dude, remember that the vent, the air ventilation goes into the other studios? 
[04:02:00]  Yeah.  Oh, are we in trouble?  Yeah, Sal.  Get that fucking out of there.  Oh, my God.  It's so smoky in here.  It's really smoky.  Open the door.  No, it's not.  Don't walk in front of water on it.  Holy shit.  Well.  Oh, boy, am I going to do it.  I'm going to do a splice-a-roo to make believe that's all one video.  Make it one piece, sure.  I'm bringing it to Ron Howard Studios. 
[04:02:30]  People are going to see that we set it for 30 seconds and ask why it's counting down from  eight minutes in the splice.  No one will notice.  Shut up, Sal.  This is terrible in here now.  It's really bad.  Yeah, it is.  I'm going to open the door again.  I don't open it.  Why?  We can't open the door?  Turn the air conditioner down so it stays on, and it'll vent out of here.  Can we microwave all the shit while we have the microwave for a few more minutes?  I don't really think we should push it.  Really?  Yeah.  Microwave.  This can of V8 closed.  Nice. 
[04:03:00]  What would happen?  Man, I don't know, but it wouldn't be good.  I bet it would explode.  You know what a can of V8 going off in a microwave would look like?  This is a bunch of kids who cut school for a day.  Yes.  Come on, man.  We're making viral videos.  Yeah.  We move the microwave to a different room with beambo still in it.  And why didn't we have just a cute kitten walking around as we did our fucking viral video?  Damn it.  Otter's holding hands.  You know what?  Otter's holding hands.  A little kitten.  Just wander around in the background.  Mowee.  Right.  Oh, the kitten would have coughed. 
[04:03:30]  Would have been adorable.  It would have been.  Love a kitten.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  What's this tape about?  We're about to listen to it.  Oh, yes.  It's good.  I hear it's really good.  It's my first TV appearance.  First TV appearance.  And what was the show? 
[04:04:00]  Featuring cunts.  Starring me.  It was Friday Night Videos.  Friday Night Videos.  I remember that show.  Oh, it's fucking embarrassing.  I might have watched this.  I'll put the video up.  I just haven't done it yet.  Oh, you're rubbing your face.  That can only mean that you're really proud of your work.  I wish I had a gun to rub it with.  This is truly embarrassing.  Why?  It just is.  It was good enough for TV.  That's where I get confused.  I know, but a lot of things are good enough.  Charlie Sheen is good enough for TV.  Have you seen some stand-ups on TV? 
[04:04:30]  Yeah, dude, that's...  I'm so...  Yeah, but you see that they're polished and doing something.  Yeah?  It might not be your...  Cup of Joe?  I was going to say that, but I know I say that a lot.  It might not be your taste or whatever.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  All right, let's listen to this from Friday Night Videos.  Friday Night Videos.  Friday Night Videos.  Jimmy.  What year is this, Jimmy?  1996.  Anything we should be looking for?  Yes.  Thank you.  How are you?  Pause the clip. 
[04:05:00]  Oh, oh.  How are you?  How are you?  What are you doing?  Wait a minute.  Your legs are very close and tight together, like you're almost clenching your butt cheeks.  Yes.  And you're rocking on your heels a little and arching backwards and forwards.  Yes, I am.  And clapping your hands like, well, yeah, yeah.  Yes, I am.  All right.  I'm doing all of those things.  I just wanted to make sure I had it correct.  Excellent confirmation job.  I'm doing all of those things.  All right.  I was trying to be likable and comfortable. 
[04:05:30]  Oh, well, it's coming across fine.  I like you.  A quirky character.  A little quirky.  But I was, by this point, like you heard the 93 tape, which is worse.  By this point, three years later, I was getting out of it, but I wasn't out yet.  It takes you a while to find it.  We're still trying to find your voice.  It really is that.  A little character thing.  Not comfortable in your own skin up on stage, was it?  You had to put on a little.  There's got to be a better way to say that.  I hear that so many times, especially with stand-up comics.  I actually was watching a documentary on Bill Hicks last night, and they were explaining 
[04:06:00]  when he finally found his voice.  Do you like when they say that?  I don't like the expression, but I get what it means.  But you understand what it means.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It just seems like there's a better way to say that, but whatever.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  I feel good, man.  I'm in a great mood.  I feel sexy.  I feel sexy.  Wasn't a joke, but thank you for laughing.  I wanted to look sexy, because it's my first TV taping, and there'd be some hot women here,  and I wanted to look good, you know?  So I ran out and spent $15 on a haircut that I could have gotten for free in a mental institution. 
[04:06:30]  This is horrifying, isn't it?  This is awful.  I grew up with a...  She fucked positive for a second.  She fucked positive for a second.  No, she fucked...  She can't even look at it.  Why can't you look at this?  Why can't anybody is the question.  She fucked me up when she went, woo!  Oh, that got you?  Yeah, because the joke would kill.  The opening joke would kill.  $15 on a haircut that I could have gotten for free in a mental institution.  And she went, woo!  And just...  She didn't need to. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was Conan's old studio in New York.  Well, she did.  Was Woody Allen an influence?  Yeah, very much so.  Can you see it in this?  I never saw that, but you might be right.  Slightly, I think.  Maybe.  Might be misreading.  I love Woody.  Not copying, but...  Oh, yeah, it's very possible, dude.  A bit of his cadence.  Oh, I never even noticed.  Hmm.  My father, which is why I got this.  And I hated that, because my father was a drunk, and he was a very embarrassing... 
[04:07:30]  Oh, what happened there?  ...man to be around, and he would take me and my mother out in the street.  Introduce us to people.  It was like, this is my wife, and this is my son.  This is for fighting.  This is for fun.  Oh.  And he was scary.  My father was very scary, because he would have...  He would have Vietnam flashbacks, which was horrifying, because he was never there.  Oh, could you pause for a minute?  One time, he threw me up again.  What's with the little snicker laugh thing?  I like it. 
[04:08:00]  It's kind of...  It lets you know that you're kind of like...  Having as much fun as they are.  This is new to me, too, people.  I don't know what I'm saying.  You know, if he wasn't there...  That's...  I just heard this myself.  You know, it would be great.  I wish...  I wish cum would just shoot out of your mic and into your face.  As do you.  I think that's the Woody Allen thing, though.  Woody Allen would...  Yeah, a little snicker.  Maybe.  It's a nervous energy.  He would trail off after his punchlines, didn't he? 
[04:08:30]  Uh, Woody?  Woody.  Woody?  Woody?  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.  That's a pretty good thing.  The wall, he said, do you know what I went through in 1967?  Canadian customs?  Take your time with that.  Thank you for laughing, those that didn't.  Did we fight Canada?  All right.  I love the high voice thing.  And the problem...  Let's get back to my head.  The...  The problem with it is it doesn't look good on me. 
[04:09:00]  My father looks great.  He has a crew cut, the handsome, sturdy, military face.  Women love my dad.  But they don't.  That's why I screwed up.  I don't have a handsome, sturdy, military type of face.  No?  I have a little fat baby face.  You do, huh?  It sucks.  I am not sexy.  A little crew cut, a little fat baby face.  A little crew cut.  Look at the bastard son of Sinead O'Connor and Uncle Fester.  Pause a minute.  It killed, oh my God.  I love the son of, and then you add two people together. 
[04:09:30]  The combo?  Yeah.  It killed, though.  It killed.  It killed.  It did, it killed.  It did, it killed.  It killed.  At the time, that was...  It's 15 years ago, so I'll forgive myself for that.  Yes, yes.  I was waiting for an on steroids punchline.  Yeah.  On steroids.  On crack.  Well, my baby face and my hair.  The material, I don't mind as much as the voice and the behavior.  Yeah, yeah, that's what it is.  Primitive material is like whatever.  Right.  It was for the, you know, for the time, it was, you know, fine.  But yeah, that high voice thing, it's cute. 
[04:10:00]  I know.  I look young, too, don't I?  I hate that.  I'm 27 years old.  I look like a little boy.  It's just the last woman that took me to bed tucked me in.  That's fine.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I just want to stay home and watch films.  You want to see good movies?  Forget the stuff that's out now.  Watch the stuff from, like, the 1940s. 
[04:10:30]  Best movies ever done.  Why?  Because they couldn't curse on camera.  They couldn't.  So they had to show, like, their anger and annoyance by overacting.  They were great movies.  Watch one of them.  Every time they get aggravated, they wouldn't curse.  They would just go.  That's in the 40s.  It's the 1990s.  That is still the best thing to do in a bar.  If a woman rejects you, it throws her right off track.  Hey, baby, can I buy you a drink? 
[04:11:00]  Oh, hey, baby.  Is that what you do in a bar, by the way?  Is that what you did, Jimmy?  Hey, baby, can I buy you a drink?  Baby, can I buy you a drink?  Good line.  Hey, baby.  Believe it or not, I have had a lot of practice dealing with rejection.  No, I have.  You know why?  And don't pretend you didn't notice.  You're a nice, polite crowd.  I have a tiny little chin, don't I?  Look at this.  I hate it.  I have the profile of a frog.  Absolutely.  I had a commercial audition today.  One line. 
[04:11:30]  Bud.  I just hate my head.  I tried to grow a goatee.  It slid off.  It's not fair, man.  Even the elephant man had a chin.  All right, granted, it was on the back of his head.  I'm proud of that one.  That's funny.  You guys are good.  It's okay to laugh.  He's not here.  And I'm sorry, but when your head is that big and fat, you deserve to stand in a cage while  British children throw pebbles at you.  British kids were great. 
[04:12:00]  They were ruthless.  Look at him.  He's got a big head.  Pow.  Pow.  You're doing characters.  I am not an animal.  Yeah, well, you're not Mel Gibson either.  Pow.  Oh.  You sounded like Catherine Hepburn.  Can you tell?  I am so hyper right now.  I drank like six cups of coffee backstage.  I feel like I'm talking like a Donald Trump.  Yeah, now Mel Gibson either.  Have the loans.  Oh, Jimmy.  I like the accent, which you have lost.  Yeah, what is that?  The accent is creeping me out. 
[04:12:30]  Was it?  Yeah, now Mel Gibson either.  Well, that was because I was doing it in a British children's voice.  No, no, no.  I know.  Just overall, I could hear more of an accent that you don't have anymore.  Oh.  I thought you were from England.  Yeah.  That's what I tried to do.  I tried to make it an organic experience for everybody.  Jimmy's like cringing here.  It's not that bad.  The voice is a little high.  It's not the material that bothers me.  Yeah, yeah.  It's literally.  I actually like the fact that I was talking about making fun of the Elfman.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the voice is pretty odd. 
[04:13:00]  Yeah.  I don't know where that came from.  Your speaking voice wasn't that, you should have put this out.  It wasn't despicable.  I'm going to.  I'll put it on a line or something.  Okay, like a hidden track or something.  Do you like my belt?  Well, it's the outfit of the times.  You were just.  A tucked in mock turtleneck?  That's how people dressed.  You look like Steve Jobs.  You look like Steve Jobs?  Yeah.  He's got the same gene.  No wonder women don't like me. 
[04:13:30]  It is not sexy to be this hyper on a date.  You know, hi, how are you?  Get away from me.  You look like Cousin Ed after chemotherapy.  Oh, God.  I would love to make love to a woman who is just as hyper as I am.  That would be worth filming.  You know, I can't sleep.  Me neither.  I am so lonely.  Any hookers here? 
[04:14:00]  No, I don't get hookers.  I don't understand in this day and age why is prostitution illegal.  What is prostitution?  It's paying somebody for sex.  That's against the law.  Now, pornography is totally legal.  And what is that?  It's paying somebody for sex and then showing it to the world.  What the hell is the difference?  So if you're going to get hookers, take my advice.  Bring a video camera.  This way, if the police kick in your door and yell,  What the hell is going on in there?  You can just jump back and yell, 
[04:14:30]  Cut!  I want to talk about something that's important.  I was almost killed today.  This is true.  I was cut off.  Thank you for laughing at that.  I was almost killed my ribs.  I was cut off by a tractor trailer.  Now, I have an airbag in my car.  A driver's side airbag.  And you are a windbag.  It is such a hazard to have it.  Because when you have an airbag,  Your horn is not where it's supposed to be, is it? 
[04:15:00]  Right?  It's not in the middle of the steering wheel  Where it's been for 80 years.  And that's where you need it when there's a truck coming.  You want the horn right there.  You know, you drive it.  Truck!  Bonk!  Bonk!  You don't have that with an airbag.  You have these little crappy rectangular horns  Up in the corner.  What the hell is that?  It's not a horn.  It's a chicklet.  It's a chicklet.  And it's not the same when there's a truck coming.  It's like,  Truck!  That's funny.  It's so true! 
[04:15:30]  My car has a G-spot and I can't find the damn thing.  Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jim Norton.  Thank you very much.  Is it?  Ladies and gentlemen.  Ladies and gentlemen.  If you enjoyed being here half as much as I've enjoyed performing,  you've enjoyed this twice as much as me.  Thank you.  I liked it.  Did you get an interview after that?  Why is there more time on this tape?  There is an interview,  but I think we played that already at one point.  But that's...  One after.  Oh, yeah.  I remember this.  Yeah, it felt good. 
[04:16:00]  It was just...  It takes a little bit of getting used to,  like looking up at the audience  as opposed to looking straight ahead  like in a comedy club.  I had a hard time.  They were great.  Good.  It wasn't too hard, huh?  No, no.  It was good.  You just can't curse.  So you've got to edit yourself as you...  You're so baby-faced.  Well, how long have you been doing stand-up?  About five years.  You're trying to be very likable.  That's not very long then?  No, I saw him when I was 21.  I was working in a warehouse  and I just...  I always wanted to do comedy.  You know, Richard Pryor, 1980.  I wanted to do...  I have to plug Pryor.  If he's watching...  Which I know he is.  I wanted to do comedy since I saw him.  Oh, even Danny had to look down on that one. 
[04:16:30]  Failing at school.  Getting thrown out  and winning Class Clown  and the whole nine years.  Oh, did you win?  Yeah, I was a failure in school  and I kind of shot there  or something overwhelming  other than Scholastics to work for.  Okay.  Scholastics.  Well, what do you like most about doing stand-up?  What are you doing?  Why are you...  It's like a quick fix, John.  You probably have a quick fix.  You know immediately if you're doing well.  I'm being a cunt.  I'm being a cunt.  Yeah, why are you being like this?  Because I'm an asshole. 
[04:17:00]  And that was my first interview, I think.  Was it?  That might be the first interview I've ever...  Because you could be like...  saying funny things.  Allegedly that happens during interviews.  But I felt it was time to really be smart and likable.  I was thin back then, too.  You are very thin.  We're looking at a very thin Jim Norton.  And you're very fresh-faced.  Who's interviewing you?  Young little whippersnapper.  One of the co-hosts. 
[04:17:30]  And they showed the interviews  from the other guys on the show,  but they never showed mine.  Yeah.  Oh, why?  Oh.  No.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  It was like you're on fucking a political talk show.  It's called  being  a boar.  Barry was my manager.  Barry Katz.  Oh, was it?  Barry.  Someone's saying that  that exact hooker with Cameron versus porno 
[04:18:00]  bit  was just on Family Guy.  Really?  Which obviously you did it  a long time ago.  Or the Cleveland show.  This guy forgot.  I've actually done that joke recently,  but obviously much more subdued.  Ripping you off.  And without all the, you know.  Hoo-hoo.  Ripping you off.  This sounds more like the Jimmy we know,  by the way.  This interview.  Just your voice and stuff.  Well, the voice is that put-on voice.  Let's see the end of this. 
[04:18:30]  Immediately if you're bombing.  Whereas, I guess, with acting or anything else,  which is another type of a skill  you don't know until it's released.  I like that because I want to know now  how I'm doing.  So, fuck acting.  Being judged by an audience.  I don't even mind bombing.  I mean, I don't mind that,  but I hate when, like,  you tell a joke and a cracker goes,  uh...  The heckling and that kind of...  Yeah, or if they're judging a joke.  It's like, if you don't think it's funny,  don't laugh,  but don't groan at me  because you know you're going to go home  and write Scarface anyway.  And it's a tough thing to do,  so they shouldn't be judging you.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if you don't like something,  I can accept that. 
[04:19:00]  I just don't like being, uh...  You got it.  I got what you said.  Say it again.  She goes, I got what you said.  Yeah, right.  Try to get it from my own experience.  If not, I'll just watch Comedy Central and steal.  Don't do that.  I'm kidding.  Now, if you weren't a stand-up comedian,  what do you think you'd be doing for a living?  I was in a warehouse before,  and probably that.  I'm very lucky.  You know, I'm very grateful  to be where I am right now.  Where are you?  I don't know what I've been doing,  to be honest with you.  Talking to someone I wanted to rape.  I don't know I wanted to do this  since I was a kid,  so it's either this or nothing.  Right.  Well, you're on the right track,  so good luck to you. 
[04:19:30]  Thanks.  Very good, Jim.  Thanks.  Okay.  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Can you hear the little sniffle after you?  Yeah, yeah.  Very good, Jim.  Thank you.  Let's do it.  Both of you are under arrest for prostitution.  It's not prostitution.  You paid her to have sex.  No, I paid her to have sex,  and we're filming it.  So technically, it's not prostitution.  It's a porno.  Oh.  Well, as long as you're filming and selling it,  it's legal. 
[04:20:00]  Enjoy your day.  Remember, kids,  she's not a whore  if she's an...  Well, that's the end of the clip.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to thank the other Lizzie on Twitter.  That's great.  Same bitch.  That's the same fucking joke, Jimmy.  Yeah, 15 years earlier.  Which you did 15 years earlier.  So you're on to something.  I love the little voice.  Yeah.  It's just hideous.  Kind of sound like a progeria kid.  Yeah, I sound like...  My name should be Seashell Boy.  Seashell Boy.  Why Seashell Boy?  I don't know,  because I'm talking like a little seashell. 
[04:20:30]  Do you have my...  Wow, that's the same fucking bit, though, huh?  It is, yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, that is the same bit.  Win it, win it, win it, boo.  That's it for the worst of O.P. Anthony.  Well, gentlemen, another show.  Well done.  I knew what to expect.  A douche chill moment.  And boy, did you deliver.  I knew what to expect.
