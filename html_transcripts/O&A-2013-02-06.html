<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with the hosts, along with Jim Norton, relentlessly mocking E-Rock, a co-worker absent due to a self-described car predicament: his Jeep Laredo, with a faulty key, was blocking his Yukon in his driveway.  A protracted, comedic segment ensued, with E-Rock live on air, struggling to follow instructions on moving his vehicles. His attempts culminated in accidentally rolling the Jeep down his icy driveway into the street, requiring a pregnant neighbor's assistance to get it moved.  E-Rock eventually solved the problem by moving his Yukon, then pushing the Jeep across the street.  Norton then shared his own recent car trouble story, involving a dead battery in Manhattan and an encounter with a bread-giving old man.  This was followed by a discussion of Norton's bed-wetting incident, blamed on valerian root.  Crude language and sexual humor permeated this portion.

The show then segued into a tirade about a co-worker's tardiness, immediately followed by a Black History Month segment featuring allegedly real inventions by African Americans (including the curtain rod and keychain) that elicited racially charged jokes and speculation.  Significant airtime was dedicated to the repeated errors in a Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement, with the hosts angrily blaming various employees and departments, demanding accountability and using profuse expletives.  This was followed by listener-submitted "F.U." messages laden with vulgarity, birthday shout-outs (Axl Rose and Zsa Zsa Gabor among them), and a discussion of a teenager flipping off a judge in court, contrasted with Lindsay Lohan's perceived preferential treatment.  A news story about a jail guard impregnated by a death row inmate sparked a discussion on the death penalty, and the show concluded this section with the story of a seven-year-old suspended for playing with imaginary grenades and a humorous news report of a reporter getting punched by an interview subject.  Microphone malfunctions were a recurring complaint throughout this segment.

Later in the show, comedian Pat Cooper was featured, graphically describing his struggles with erectile dysfunction. This transitioned back to E-Rock's automotive misadventures, his wife's reaction, and a digression into cereal preferences.  A substantial portion of the broadcast focused on the contentious relationship between on-air personalities Iraq and Troy, highlighted by Troy's New Year's resolution to curb his complaints about Iraq. Troyâ€™s new show intro, featuring celebrity impersonations, was played and praised.  A woman suing an L.A. Fitness gym for sexually suggestive exercises prompted a crude discussion of the hosts' gym experiences and judgments on the woman's appearance.  The segment ended with another airing of the flawed Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement, further escalating their frustration with the sponsor's repeated mistakes. Troy and Nicole were in-studio guests during this section.

A subsequent segment centered on the continued debacle of the Steven Singer Jewelers commercial, specifically identifying the "Traffic" department's error in copy-pasting.  Sam investigated the delay in correction, and Rob Cross, the responsible employee, offered a formal apology. Steven Singer himself appeared in studio to apologize, explaining his busy schedule. This led to discussions of workplace inefficiencies, comparisons with other radio stations, and tangents including a "slow carb diet" discussion with Joel McHale (a guest throughout much of this segment), McHale's recounting of injuring Chevy Chase, a Pajamagram ad, a humorous "Fishing is Not a Sport" ad narrated by Jim Norton, and a bizarre extended bit about Steven Singer's surprisingly sharp "tin roses."  Further discussions touched upon Joel McHale's Tosh.0 appearance, syndication deals, and various television shows.  Mike Tyson, Dr. Oz, and Brian Williams were mentioned as future guests.

The final segment discussed a canceled and revived female talk show, comparing it to the longevity of Maury Povich and Jerry Springer (mentioning that Maury used some of Opie and Anthony's material and guests, including "Stalker Patty").  Joel McHale, promoting *Community* and his stand-up tour, was a guest and accidentally broke one of Singer's roses.  The conversation moved to reality TV shows like *Alaska's Gold Rush* and the *Real Housewives* franchise, including discussion of a tragic suicide within the *Beverly Hills* cast.  A significant portion featured Jim Norton's advice segment, covering listener questions ranging from increased libido after viewing Norton's uncensored special to bestiality.  The show concluded with live reads for Steven Singer Jewelers and Shari's Berries, featuring Norton's sexually explicit humor.  One final mention made is the phrase "now done dealing with your bullshit,"  though there's no further context provided for its meaning.

[00:00:00]  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  The 
[00:00:30]  The  The  The  The  The  The  The  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  All aboard.  All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker.  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flatulent.  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, all right, the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and ball. 
[00:04:00]  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  Are you guys having a good time?  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it.  I'm on the show.  It's his cock.  With Opie, the destroyer. 
[00:04:30]  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass.  It makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful.  But I just can't take them.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  And this one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:05:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, Jimmy.  Good morning, everybody.  Oi.  Oi.  Might as well continue the discussion right away here.  E-Rock is not here today.  Yeah, apparently.  What, in trouble?  I could speak for myself.  And if others want to jump in, fine.  It's just annoying when he's not here.  Because it's not like everyone else.  Everyone else just tells you what's going on.  They're like, hey, I'm taking a day.  I got a day coming to me.  I'm taking a day.  I'm sick.  But E-Rock, it's always some weird vagary. 
[00:05:30]  It's a problem.  He's not coming in today because he said he's having problems with his car.  Sam?  So he's having problems with his car.  Electrical problems, he said?  He says it's an electrical problem, and he said he won't be in right away.  So is it going?  Oh, wait, wait.  So there's a possibility he's showing up.  He won't say.  That's why it's so frustrating.  He's vague. 
[00:06:00]  Like, we could do the show without him easily, and we'll prove that in a couple hours here.  But here's the other thing that, you know, it's a touchy situation, but safe to say, well,  I guess we have said it, his wife works here.  His wife works here.  And she's coming in early today because her big client, Steven Singer, is going to be here.  Ooh.  So at the very worst, he could be here when she arrives at around 7 o'clock.  Yeah.  There's no reason he can't get on a train at 6.  But why wouldn't he just say, look, I'm having car trouble. 
[00:06:30]  I've decided I'm just going to take the day.  Screw it.  I got a day coming to me.  But it's always just this vague shit.  He might show up.  He might not.  He doesn't want to admit it's a nice little treat vacation for him.  Right.  Is he getting a jump?  Is his car going, or is it going, he said, he has to figure, because Travis goes, well,  when he started getting vague about whether or not he's coming in, because that's the  thing, because he also, he loves to accumulate things, you know? 
[00:07:00]  He loves to collect things.  Oh, he's a collector.  So he doesn't like the idea of not having his days.  So if he can try to pull this off and still have all of his days all piled up, then he's  got more days.  All right.  He loves his days.  He loves his days.  He loves having days.  Yes.  Collect them all.  We all love collecting days.  But he's horrible at it.  He says that he can't come in until he figures out exactly what's wrong with the car. 
[00:07:30]  But, and he won't start figuring that out until he wakes up around nine or 10, right?  It's not like he's up now trying to figure it out.  Or couldn't he figure it out yesterday?  Or he could figure it out at 1130 after the show.  When did the car problems start?  We didn't hear about any car problems until this morning.  And by the way, we found out, he found out he had car problems after the rest of us  were here.  And what about a train option?  I know where he lives. 
[00:08:00]  Of course.  I could get to his house if there's no traffic probably in 15 minutes.  Wouldn't you wake your life up and say, take me to the train immediately?  Yes, of course.  It's not a hobby.  Or go in with her.  She's coming in early.  You can easily either wake her up or call a cab.  And she's up because she's coming in early.  She can drive you to the train and he can get on a six o'clock train.  Travis just made the, do you want me to call him?  Of course.  Oh, yes, of course. 
[00:08:30]  I think we need to see it at the bottom of this.  That's what I live for.  Watching that fucking phone ringing down here.  And then the laughing right before the show.  Because, Jimmy, what did you say?  You want to say it for the audience?  What did he say?  He said something about, hey.  No, I said, well, is he going to go fix his car?  Oh, and I'm like, yeah, I want to buy a sofa, but I'm like, should I do it at eight o'clock  or when I get off the radio?  Because if you do it when you get off the air?  Right.  You do it all day.  He comes in and then you deal with it.  We're done by ten.  And I'm going to say again, it's okay to have days off no matter what you do. 
[00:09:00]  But it's the way he goes about it that drives us nuts.  Just fake his sick day.  Just say, you know what, guys, I'm nauseous.  But we don't even know.  He might show up.  Mighty.  Wow.  Eric, comment.  Hello.  Iraq.  What's going on?  What's going on with you, sir?  I'm having some car issues.  What happened?  What kind of car do you have?  The car that's giving me a problem is Jeep Laredo. 
[00:09:30]  Wait, the car.  So does that mean you could use the other car?  No, that's the problem.  The car that's blocking me is the Jeep, and I can't get my car out.  Can't you just roll your car?  If I knew how to put this thing into neutral, I would gladly try to move it to the street.  Wait, what?  Why can't you put it in neutral?  Because it's having an electrical problem.  It's a damaged key.  As soon as you open up the car, and then you can't get anything to function or slide it into neutral. 
[00:10:00]  Okay, so there's no way to get the other car out.  What kind of car is that?  The one that's having a problem is a Jeep Laredo.  What year?  2010.  All right.  Well, 2010.  We're going to get some mechanics calling in now.  Oh, right.  That would be great.  That would be great.  They'll help you.  Now, does it have a smart key?  I guess that's what you would call it.  There are these electronic keys, but you can also, you have an emergency metal key that you take out of the bottom, 
[00:10:30]  and that doesn't even work.  What does it do when you put it in the ignition?  It just says, the light says damage key, and as soon as you turn it, everything turns off.  And then you can't put it in neutral?  No.  Is that so, like, you know, someone won't just roll your car onto the back of a truck or something?  I don't know.  If someone can tell me how to do it with, you know, if someone can tell me how to do it, 
[00:11:00]  I'll gladly try to push this thing in the street, but I can't get into neutral with no power here.  So you're up for coming to work today, if you can figure all this out.  Yeah, if I can get this car out, I'll be right at work.  Well, how about this?  How about this?  How about, instead of doing that, maybe you do that later, and knowing that this is one of those things,  maybe you just got to hop on the choo-choo.  I don't have a choo-choo near me, but the buses don't, let's see, oh, it's after six,  so I guess the buses start around here. 
[00:11:30]  I'm sure there's buses.  What about, what's the car in front of that car?  The car in front of that car is my car.  And what is that?  That is a Yukon.  A Yukon.  Now, you have no room to finagle that Yukon around that?  No, he's got a tight driveway.  I've been to his house.  I've got a really, it's just a one-lane driveway that goes right next to my neighbor's house.  What about the wife? 
[00:12:00]  Isn't she coming in early?  She's coming in in a while.  We're just probably going to have to take the bus in.  What time might you be taking the bus in?  I don't know.  Let me see what time.  Well, you're doing nothing right now.  So you haven't even looked up bus times yet?  Not yet.  And what time's the bus?  This is why we do this.  Does anyone else hear how frustrating this is?  Rupert, the bus is out front.  I've got to go catch a bus. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, just say goodbye to fucking Liza and Jerry and get on the bus.  He doesn't even looked up bus schedules yet.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  When did you notice the car was having problems?  About 5 o'clock this morning.  Oh, okay.  People are saying there's a button next to the shifter exactly for this reason.  Hold on.  Oh, it's that button thing, so you can do it automatically.  Hold on, hold on. 
[00:13:00]  There's a button.  You see the button?  Nope.  Hang on.  Just in case.  Yeah, that's to set up the next part.  Go ahead.  Okay.  It says dash key, so I'm putting the key in.  You turn it and all the lights go off here.  Nope.  Now, I'm looking at the shifting here.  Is there a button next to the shifter?  There's a plus and minus button. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, no.  That's the move here.  Never mind.  Uh-huh.  Next to the shifter.  Turn the Jeep's neutral safety switch in the off position, you dumb fuck.  I'm reading that verbatim.  Yes.  What does that mean?  I know.  You've got to be a little more specific here.  See, what's the matter, Iraq?  You don't like the vagary of these answers?  Yeah.  We've got so many mechanics calling in now. 
[00:14:00]  We've got Jason on the line with Iraq.  Go ahead, Jason.  Right around the side of the shifter, there should be a hole that you actually stick the  key into, and then you can actually shift it in.  It's meant for cars that are hard working.  Iraq?  You can actually put it in as a neutral.  By the shifter.  Around the shifter.  It should just look just like a keyhole.  Every single car has it.  Looks like a keyhole.  Just a little slot. 
[00:14:30]  Little slot.  I'm looking.  I don't.  On the shifter?  Anywhere around the shifter.  Near the e-brake if it's next to the shifter.  Iraq e-brake.  Pretty cool.  Anything?  Iraq, comment?  I'm looking here.  Someone said you might have to dig the cake frosting out of the keyhole.  That's very funny.  Oh, that's Steve from Bayshore, of course. 
[00:15:00]  You eating pizza, too?  What do you got, Iraq?  You're figuring this out.  It's nothing.  I'm looking here.  It's still sitting in park, and there's no...  But are you doing what Jason's telling you to do?  There's no keyhole in the shifter here.  There has to be.  It's a neutral safety switch.  Every car has them.  Every car.  Where is this thing, Jason?  I'm a little confused.  I mean, each car is in a different area, but most of the time it should be somewhere right around there. 
[00:15:30]  All right, hold on.  I'm going to move on to someone else.  Thank you, Jason.  Let me say hi to Steve.  Steve, you're on with E-Rock.  Yeah, that's a real, real easy solution.  Take that Yukon, put it in four-wheel low, and push that piece of shit out into the street.  There you go.  What do you think?  Yeah.  Would you do that?  No, I'm not doing that.  All right, here's another guy saying there's some kind of button or something.  Dom in Texas.  Dom.  Okay, look, there's going to be like a little, it's either like what the other guy was saying, 
[00:16:00]  a keyhole or a little small, black button.  And what you do is you push, you put on the brake, you push on that button, push your, you know,  there's a little button on your shifter, and put it in neutral.  It's fucking easy.  It's either a button or the little slot where you stick your key in, and it disengages,  and you can move it into neutral.  Yeah, everyone keeps saying this, and I'm not seeing this. 
[00:16:30]  Put your fucking glasses on.  Sorry, man, man.  I don't know how to use a car.  What?  Yeah, but he's giving you, I guess, a very easy solution.  A lot of people say it's an easy solution.  On the right side.  There might be a cover over the slot, which is now coming in, from Matt.  I'm seeing on the right side of the transmission or shifter.  Shifter.  Somewhere.  You see a little cover.  What is this thing here? 
[00:17:00]  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  What is this thing here?  Oh, it's a treadmill.  What do you think?  Okay.  Yeah, really.  You and Governor Christie could be workout buddies.  Yeah.  There's something.  Gym buddies.  Something here looks like a little plastic cap.  I'm trying to...  Oh, okay.  All right.  Now.  Comment.  All right.  Can you do something with that? 
[00:17:30]  Uh, yeah.  I got to get a knife or something to try to pop it open.  What?  Well, can't you just...  E-Rock, when I had car trouble, I just called 911.  So that's also an option.  Sam, you should really stay out of this discussion.  You really should, bro.  You really should stay out of this fucking discussion.  Fruit.  Yeah.  Cover over the slot.  I lost my Chrysler guy.  Oh, I hope he's okay.  Use the other key.  Disconnect the battery.  Look in the fucking manual someone's writing. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, my God.  I looked at the manual.  All right.  Hold on.  This guy has the exact same car as you.  So this should be it right here.  Oh, okay.  This will do it.  Vic, you have the exact same car as E-Rock, right?  Yes.  All right.  There's a small square plastic cover that's right to the right of the ship.  You remove that cover, the button's underneath it.  All right.  I think that's what this is.  I'm trying to get the cap off of here.  Come on.  Just imagine it's salad dressing.  Oh. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  E-Rock?  Punch it out, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Vic.  All right.  E-Rock?  Okay.  Well, whatever this was is broken off of it now.  He did it.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Driving his hoof into it.  Now, what's there?  Looking inside, it's red with a little white thing on the side here.  All right. 
[00:19:00]  Do you push it in, or are you putting the key in there?  What are you doing?  Right now, I'm sticking a knife in it, trying to see if that unlocks anything.  That's what he's used to doing.  He's going to get electrocuted.  And a fork.  Right.  Uh, it should just be a switch.  Hey, there we go.  All right.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  How, uh...  Neutral.  No.  Yeah, you're going to roll it backwards?  Yeah, I'll roll it out into the street, and then, uh... 
[00:19:30]  Then I'll come in.  Well, let's hear you do that.  Yeah, we might as well.  Yeah, we might as well, you know, take this one right to the end here.  Whoa, shit!  Oh, my God.  What?  All right.  Iraq?  Yes.  What happened?  I wasn't paying attention, and the car was sliding into the street.  Well, that's what you're...  That's what you're trying to make it do. 
[00:20:00]  You're just not used to motion, are you?  Jesus.  I just went down.  You didn't have your foot on the brake when you put it in neutral on an incline?  No.  Yeah, yeah.  I know his driveway.  It's like on an incline.  It's a pretty good incline, too.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock?  Are you okay?  You live, you learn.  So what happened?  You almost hit the wall or something?  Why have you not...  No, I'm sitting here with my foot on the brake. 
[00:20:30]  All right, well...  And I'm going to have to figure out how to...  See, the wheel won't turn.  It's going down the driveway,  the driveway,  but I can't get the wheel to turn.  What if you put the key in  and turn the key  to unlock the steering wheel?  Hang on.  No.  I'm in neutral.  I have the brake on.  It still says damage key,  and as soon as you turn it,  everything goes off  and the wheel doesn't move.  The wheel doesn't unlock. 
[00:21:00]  Wheel's pretty straight, though,  I would assume.  The wheel's not unlocking.  So if anyone knows how to unlock the wheel...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, please.  All right, but we do have the car in neutral,  so now we just need to unlock this.  The car's in neutral, yes.  I just can't get the wheel to turn now.  Oh, my God.  Well, put it in...  Just turn it harder.  Yeah, that'll do it.  Nothing.  All right, how does Eric turn the wheel?  Have you used the other key?  Yeah, I've used both keys.  Both keys, okay. 
[00:21:30]  All right, because that's coming in already.  Another...  Yeah, another suggestion coming in.  Tell him to go get a real man.  That would be lovely.  All right, we're on a delay,  so now we're waiting for the mechanics  to call back in.  The phones were lit with this dumb thing.  Is it locked, locked, the steering wheel,  or is it just that the power steering's off?  No, it's locked, locked.  It's not like I could really pull the wheel  and make the turn. 
[00:22:00]  It's just not going left or right at all.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  All right, I think we're going back to the phones.  All right.  Let's see if...  Who's answering the phone's incredibly slow?  Sal is.  Jason in Cleveland.  Jason.  Hey, C-Rock,  the wheel's not going to turn easily  because there's no power steering  because the motor's not running.  You're going to have to put some cake power into it,  fat boy.  Yeah, how about a little elbow grease, E-Rock? 
[00:22:30]  Now, E-Rock, if you put the key in  and turn the key like you're trying to start the vehicle,  you've done that.  Yeah.  It says damaged key and all that shit.  And it doesn't unlock the steering wheel.  No, it says...  There's a light on the dashboard here  that says damaged key  even before you put the key in.  So once you have the key in here  and you turn it to the right,  the power goes off.  But...  E-Rock, E-Rock,  what's the...  But your steering wheel lock  is a mechanical lock  that locks the steering wheel in place  to keep it from an anti-cell. 
[00:23:00]  The problem with your car right now  is the anti-cell has gone off  and it's not recognizing the key to the vehicle.  That's an electrical problem.  But as soon as the key turns forward,  the steering wheel will unlock.  The reason it doesn't turn like it does  when the engine's running  because there's no power steering from the motor  is that the motor's not driving from running.  So you're going to have to really put some elbow grease into it  like it was an old-school car with no power steering.  Yeah, it'll move, right? 
[00:23:30]  You're a wimp, E-Rock.  He's saying you're a wimp.  It'll just be tougher to turn.  Oh.  Oh, God.  Do you have, like, an extra key in the house  that might work?  No, we have two keys for this car  and both of them don't do anything.  All right.  Plus, they're electronic keys,  but inside the electronic keys  have actual regular metal keys  and those don't do anything either.  All right, are you going to try what he said,  a little elbow grease?  Yeah, I'm going to have to push the car out.  All right, let's do this. 
[00:24:00]  All right, E-Rock.  I can't push the car and turn it  while sitting on the phone.  Oh, well, then just put the phone in your lap  and we'll listen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Speaker phone that shit.  That's why speaker phone was invented.  Yeah, bitch.  All right, all right.  Hang on.  All right, you're on speaker phone.  You there?  Yeah, right here.  Okay, just making sure.  All right.  All right. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, fuck.  What is that knife?  Oh, God.  I love E-Rock.  Just a blithering idiot.  I'm in neutral.  And the ice isn't helping.  Oh, fuck.  E-Rock?  All right.  All right.  Well, the neighbor's garbage cans  are laying in the middle of the road.  Ah, all right. 
[00:25:00]  Now, I got to move this thing  into the side of the street.  Do you hear that noise?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the door opened.  I see E-Rock just backing up.  So the car moved down your driveway nicely.  Sort of, yeah.  Now, you got to kind of maneuver it  into a parking spot.  Trying to push it across the street. 
[00:25:30]  He's out there pushing his car.  Does the steering wheel turn?  Yeah, he's already down the driveway.  It's in the street now.  Just barely.  Well, it's because it's got no power steering.  You got to put some muscle in that.  Remember the whole power steering discussion we had?  Yeah.  And the street is icy.  Oh, I hope he slips and runs himself over. 
[00:26:00]  How many people are out there  just waiting for a crash sound?  Oh, I know.  No kidding.  All right, this thing ain't moving.  I'm stuck in the middle of the street.  What do you mean it's not moving?  Is it blocking the middle of the street?  E-Rock, you're a big fan of the Twitter.  You got to tweet a couple pictures  of your car in the middle of the street.  All right, I'll do one right now. 
[00:26:30]  Hold on.  Okay.  E-Rock.  Hang on.  So now the car's in the middle of the street.  Yeah, hold on.  How come he can't push it to the side of the road?  That's a good question, man.  That's a really good question.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Why can't you push it?  Why can't you push it to the side of the street?  Because I'm horribly out of shape.  Is your car stuck in the middle of the street? 
[00:27:00]  Yes, it is.  Now you're going to have to, like, knock on your neighbor's door.  You're going to need a little more muscle.  At 6.30 in the morning.  You told me your neighbor likes helping you out,  so this is a perfect day for him to step up.  Why don't you just push it back up the driveway with your other vehicle?  Oh, boy, no.  E-Rock?  Yeah.  Why don't you just push it up the driveway with your other vehicle? 
[00:27:30]  Are you trying to kill me?  Maybe your wife should just push it to the side of the road for you.  Yeah, maybe she can steer and you can push.  Hold on a minute.  Let's say hi to Brent in D.C.  Brent.  Oh, what's up, guys?  How is E-Rock's wife, like, even with her?  This is just so fucking embarrassing.  Embarrassing.  People are saying this is embarrassing, E-Rock.  You want to comment on that?  Sure is.  A lot of people are saying if you disconnect the battery,  it might reset the computer. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, it got disconnected for, like, ten minutes,  but it's kind of a pain in the ass.  Not really.  You lift in the hood.  I don't know how to put it in neutral.  You don't know how to disconnect the battery on your car?  That's true.  He just knows how to put batteries in and take them out of toys.  Right.  Yeah.  E-Rock.  Did you...  A lot of people are saying, take the brake off.  Did you take the brake off?  Because the car will move much better.  Oh.  It's the emergency brake on. 
[00:28:30]  He's coughing.  I love his coughing.  E-Rock.  Yeah, I know.  He's been coughing for three straight years.  He's like Don Corleone going through the garden.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  All right.  The guy's going to explain to you how to turn the wheel now,  because you're in the middle of the street in front of your house.  I don't understand, but my street also is partially on an incline,  so I'm trying to keep it from going down into the other street  while the street is icy here.  But the incline should help you move the car. 
[00:29:00]  Oh.  It helped me get out of the driveway, and then I cut the wheel,  and now it's going backwards past my house.  Yeah.  Well, unless I wanted to go over the edge into a park,  I'm trying to pick it up.  Yeah.  Well, I know where his house is situated.  This could be a...  This could turn into a big issue.  It really can't.  It's a neighborhood to-do.  Oh, my God.  So what are you going to do now? 
[00:29:30]  Hey.  Hi.  Who's that?  Somebody's walking a dog.  So tell them you need help pushing the damn car.  Yeah.  He's not going to be able to help me.  Hold on.  Tracy's going to help you.  Oh, cool.  Tracy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You're on with E-Rock.  He's got to put the damn thing in park.  It's not going to start.  It's not going to...  The steering wheel's not going to turn until the damn thing's in park. 
[00:30:00]  So if he puts it in park, what happens?  That doesn't make any sense.  It was in park to begin with.  Yeah, it was in park to begin with there, silly.  Shut the fuck up.  Give it to someone with half a girl's name.  Mm-hmm.  Well, the steering wheel won't unlock until it's in park.  You know, E-Rock, you got that really nice Yukon in the driveway.  Why don't you take the Yukon out now?  It's a two-man job.  And maybe you can lightly push that Laredo of yours into a spot. 
[00:30:30]  I'm definitely thinking of doing that.  Now, you're going to need the wife and the other vehicle to steer.  Yeah.  Has she had enough of your bungling?  She's tired of his bungling.  His bungling.  His constant bungling.  Where is she right now?  He's getting ready to go to work.  Oh, wow.  What a novel thing to happen in the Nagel house. 
[00:31:00]  She's not amused by his comedy of errors anymore?  No.  No, not really.  No.  Is she sick and tired of your follies?  My husband's follies.  This is now a problem.  Now, what's going on now?  Right now, my car is in the middle of the street where it intersects with the street that goes  to the side of my house.  And I can't push the car up any further. 
[00:31:30]  So it's blocking the road?  How many roads is it blocking now?  It's blocking one, but potentially two.  Why don't you just let it go in reverse then and go down that little incline?  Because if it goes in reverse, it's going to go...  Oh, wait a minute.  Now, if it goes in reverse, it's going to go off the side into the park that's near my house.  Well, why don't you turn the wheel?  Remember, he can't.  No, he can turn it.  It just takes some muscle. 
[00:32:00]  And once it's rolling, the steering works a lot easier.  If it's just sitting there, it's very difficult.  But once it's rolling, then you can turn that wheel easier.  Okay, but where the car needs to go on the side of the street,  not down the end of the street into a park.  So you're just going to leave your car there?  Yeah, leave it there.  Jump on a bus.  I'm going to try to wave someone down to push my car. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, God.  I'm going to push my car.  Eric Gumm.  He's the best.  He rock, man.  He's out there on the ice trying to push his truck up a little hill.  A slight hill.  Oh, boy.  You might need a tow truck.  Have you considered calling AAA?  Well, I am now.  I didn't. 
[00:33:00]  I was in the driveway.  I was trying to get out of the driveway.  All right, hold on a minute.  We got Chuck on the line.  Chuck, you're on with E-Rock.  Chuck.  Hello?  Hey.  What's up, Chuck?  Oh, it's John.  Oh, John, what's up?  Oh, it was probably about 10 minutes away from E-Rock if you want some assistance.  What are you?  A murderer?  No.  No.  He has to be.  E-Rock, do you want a complete stranger to know where you live?  But he will help you out. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I challenged him to his WWE belt.  Oh, my God.  Years ago.  People aren't very helpful at this hour.  Wait, you'll help him, though?  I'd help him.  I'd have no problem with that.  What do you do that qualifies you?  I am a mechanic, but I work for public works now.  He works for public works.  Public works.  That's great.  I do that thing.  Nice.  You guys all day.  E-Rock, do you want this stranger to come to your house? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, I'm good.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, John.  Oh, Jimmy.  All right, so we don't have a solution here for E-Rock.  Now he's just in the middle of the street on some ice.  How come you didn't call the tow truck when it was in the driveway?  Could the tow truck not have gotten to it?  Well, you know the way my driveway is.  As far up as the car was, I don't think they'd been able to get to it until I got it off the actual driveway.  And now where is it?  Sitting in the middle of the street.  Oh, boy. 
[00:34:30]  You want to try that disconnecting of the battery thing?  Not in the middle of the street, I don't.  All right.  Well, I mean, if it's not moving, it's not moving.  You might as well disconnect the battery.  Should we send Troy Kwan to go help him?  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to flag somebody down.  All right.  Flag somebody.  They're not going to stop.  No one stops.  Unless it's a skateboard.  Troy Kwan can't fix it.  It's fine.  Not at this hour.  We're just a serial killer?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  A cannibal. 
[00:35:00]  A Prius slow down, looked at me, and then kept going.  That's good.  Of course.  It's 6 in the morning.  Yeah.  They're all rushing to work.  They don't know who you are, what you want.  Right.  Imagine if it was a cannibal who sees you rock and thinks he hits the lottery.  Is it cold outside?  Yeah, just a bit.  I don't have any gloves.  You don't even have, like, the basics on for this?  I have a WrestleMania hoodie. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Ooh.  That's about it.  It still won't start, huh?  Bad key.  No pants.  Damaged key.  Damaged.  I think you disconnect the battery.  Let it sit for a few minutes.  Might restart that whole fucking computer of yours in there.  I think that's the option, right?  Yeah.  Damaged key.  Hmm.  Key problem.  Yeah.  Pop that hood. 
[00:36:00]  It says damaged key.  Hmm.  Oh, problems and solutions.  Just doing a little reading here.  Oh.  Because, you know, it's pretty easy to just...  Everything I was looking online says that for a damage key thing, it may have to be reprogrammed.  So I don't know what that means.  Oh.  That means disconnect the battery.  That might reset everything.  That's coming in a lot.  Can somebody walk him through disconnecting the battery? 
[00:36:30]  All right.  Hold on.  We got Patrick.  Oh.  Yo, Patrick.  Yeah.  All right.  You're on with E-Rod.  He doesn't have to let it sit after he unhooks that battery.  He can just touch the positive and the negative cables together.  That'll dissipate the charge, and it'll reset the computer.  But what kind of idiot has a truck and doesn't have any kind of chain or rope that he could  hook to the other one and just tow it himself back into his driveway?  Oh, man.  Wow.  The one who lives in a civilized society. 
[00:37:00]  E-Rock.  Civilized.  Fucking E-Rock.  One with a broke truck.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  That's true, Patrick.  All right.  Well, look, guys.  All right, man.  I don't know.  I mean, we'd like to wrap everything up nice, but we don't have a solution here.  E-Rock is going to have to leave him in the middle of the road with no gloves.  And a WrestleMania hoodie.  And a WrestleMania hoodie. 
[00:37:30]  WrestleMania hoodie.  Why don't you get to disconnect the battery?  If I didn't know how to put it in neutral, I'm not going to fuck with electronics.  All right, E-Rock.  What's your next move?  As a human being, everyone needs their next move.  What do you got?  Yeah.  The next move is I'm probably going to have to ask my wife to come sit in the car while  I get my car out, circle the block, and then push her car off to the side of the street.  Okay.  Can we be on the radio for this?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Sure.  All right.  Finally, I can't tweet photos while I'm on the phone, so at some point, if you want  to see this, I'm going to have to get off and call you right back.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We'll let you go, but we're going to call you right back.  It's E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  Now, you're going to get some followers today because everyone's going to want to see your  dopey car in the middle of the icy road.  Okay.  All right.  We'll call you back in a few.  All right.  All right.  He never disappoints.  No, he's the best.  I am here to say he never disappoints.  It's like, yeah, yeah. 
[00:38:30]  When he was even hinting, when it went into neutral and that he was going to hang up before  he rolled his car backwards, I'm like, there's no way.  Right.  He's got to stay on.  That was almost disaster.  And I was hoping that it would just roll across the street and hit something.  Of course, it could have a park, yes.  Yeah.  It sucks having car trouble and not knowing the first thing about cars.  Well, people are saying Sam's giving him shit and you couldn't change a fucking tire.  I mean, I'm the one who brought that up.  But actually, I had major car trouble this past weekend on Saturday. 
[00:39:00]  I had to head down to Philly for the Super Bowl and I had to get cupcakes on Columbus Avenue.  And I get back to the car.  Huh?  Who's she?  Cupcakes.  Yeah.  I had to go get cupcakes.  Got to get cupcakes.  And then I had to go pick up the family.  I jump in the car all nice.  They're ready to go.  I just have to pick them up and I turn the key and battery problems.  Wait, it was on Columbus?  Columbus Avenue, right in front of Magnolia's, if people need to know.  Did it just click or nothing?  It just literally clicked. 
[00:39:30]  And I was having sort of on and off battery problems, but I thought it was my stupid garage leaving shit on and stuff.  But it turns out that I had no charge left in the battery, which I learned a day later.  Maybe a dead battery.  So now I'm on Columbus Avenue, no fucking gloves, with a dead battery.  That sucks.  And I don't know anybody.  We don't know anyone in Manhattan that could just come over easy like you have in the suburbs, like a brother or somebody.  Go, hey, could you come over here and give me a jump?  And I don't have fucking jumper cables.  So then I'm like, I pop the hood assuming that'll make people at least come and, you know. 
[00:40:00]  No.  No shit.  Never.  I learned the hard way.  Not only did they not come over, I watched people make sure they didn't make eye contact with me over and over again.  And I'm fucking freezing.  I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do?  So then I start hailing cabs.  Were you in a spot at least?  I was in a spot.  It happened to be a spot.  You were in a terrible spot.  It's now.  So now I'm hailing cabs.  And I'm like, look, $20.  Give me a fucking jump.  Because this was happening a little bit, but a jump got it going again. 
[00:40:30]  Okay?  So I knew a jump would take care of it.  Not one cabbie has jumper cables.  You should always have them if you can.  And I'm like, look, I'll fucking pay you.  And then they're getting insulted.  No cable.  But they're getting insulted.  Like, I would just do it for you.  I'm like, yeah, but I'm just saying I would pay you because it's a nice thing for you to do for me.  Oh, boy.  And you're out here trying to make money, so why not?  Oh, boy.  So I hailed like five or six cabs and realized none of those guys fucking carry jumper cables, which seems to be strange to me.  Don't be too sure, Ralph. 
[00:41:00]  I ain't got no hairpin.  They put the hairpin in the car.  So then my next move, and I'm sad to say that, actually, my wife came up with it because, remember, I just said you have to always have that next move.  I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do?  There's nowhere around to even get jumper cables in that neighborhood.  Oh, man.  She goes, look, every parking garage has to have jumper cables.  I'm like, holy shit.  Good fucking call.  That's true.  So then I go into the â€“ that's Iraq's car?  Yeah.  That is in the middle of the street.  Oh, right.  Wow.  Wait, wait.  Is that his driveway to the right?  I'm trying to figure out. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  So he went down.  No.  No, it's not.  No?  No.  His driveway would be this way.  Yeah?  So that's the one to the left, his driveway.  I think that's his driveway up ahead to the left, I believe.  To the left.  So he rolled out.  He was able to cut the wheel.  Right.  But he wasn't able to cut it.  Yeah.  He was able to cut the wheel, but he couldn't cut it to get into a spot.  Like, all he needs to do is go that way.  He's on a 90 â€“ right now he's on a 90-degree angle from where he started.  Where he started.  So he obviously was able to cut the wheel.  So what the fuck? 
[00:42:00]  How much room is there behind him?  Not much at this point, I would have to assume.  That's getting close to where he wouldn't be able to park.  But â€“  He missed his opportunity, basically.  But where does that road go?  That's more of a main road.  But, like, behind him, what happens?  Is it a T?  Yeah.  Then why can't he keep going backwards, just cut around the T until he â€“  He probably can't park this front of the main road.  Yeah, it's a main road.  There's no real parking there.  He probably could, but it would be facing the wrong direction, too.  Hey, your car's fucked up.  It's not going to get a ticket there, really? 
[00:42:30]  In the middle of the street it would.  Well, in the middle of the street, better to put it next to the curb.  How the fuck didn't he get into a spot?  He was able to get it â€“ it's 90 degrees from where it started.  He should have been able to cut it more and get it right next to that curb.  So, anyway, I go to the parking garage, and I go to the guy â€“ you got jumper cables.  And I thought they had those â€“ you know, the portable with the thing where you hook it up.  You know what?  You don't need the other car.  Old school.  They hand me jumper cables.  I'll go, I'll fucking return these, no problem.  I have not returned them yet. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, shit.  You stole their fucking jumper cables.  I had to.  Because when I did eventually get the car started, I needed to get to Philly, and I didn't know if it was going to happen again.  Oh, boy.  I fixed the car in Philly, which I said yesterday.  But, anyway, so I go back.  Now I'm in the same situation.  I got the hood up, but now I'm showing everyone jumper cables.  I just need one stupid fucking car to stop.  Oh, man.  I would never, ever stop.  No one stopped.  No.  Not one fucking person.  People were pulling in in front of me because that spot opened up, and they're ignoring me like, oh, I might have to get involved. 
[00:43:30]  You know what a pain in the ass it is to jump somebody?  It's a pain in the ass.  You got to turn your car the wrong way on a one-way street.  Which side's your battery on?  Oh, it's the other way.  All right.  Let me turn.  Oh, let me see.  All right.  It's hooked up.  Go try it.  All right.  It's not working.  Let me jiggle it.  Let me jiggle it.  Yeah, hit the gas a little.  It's still not working.  Now you're obligated to sit there.  So then there's a horrendous white van with a rattling engine.  Drives by me.  Beeping, and he stops about a little further up. 
[00:44:00]  He missed me by a little bit.  So now he wants to back up on Columbus Avenue.  That's a crazy fucking move.  He's going to help me.  I'm like, this fucking rock's finally got somebody.  Then there's a lady trying to get back up into the spot in front of me.  And this guy's just trying to move.  And he was going to use that spot to kind of help a little bit.  But, of course, she has to make it all about herself.  And she slowly backs in and out of the spot until she gets her car perfect.  While this van is trying to back up to help me, she gets out.  Of course, another one that doesn't even look at me. 
[00:44:30]  Obviously, hood up.  Cable's in my hand.  Oh, boy.  And then he finally pulls up.  He's an old black guy in an old white van that's ready to fucking be junked.  Lord.  Couldn't have been nicer to me.  Have mercy.  Jump.  He gets my car started and then gives me fucking a whole bag of bread that he's been delivering to all the shelters in the area.  Oof.  But he couldn't have been nicer.  Didn't want the money.  I said, just take the fucking money. 
[00:45:00]  And that's my story.  So, wait, now did you bring, because it's bad karma, you've got to bring those jumper cables back.  I will.  Yeah, you sure.  But I was worried, you know, going down to Philly.  Just tell them you forgot.  Tell them I was busy.  Yeah, yeah.  They'll understand when I finally give them back.  Because now I've got a nice new battery because I took care of the situation down in Philly.  It turned out the charge on the battery is absolutely down to almost nothing.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  In a car that's three years old, although the new battery guy said, yeah, that's about it nowadays.  Yeah, that's all you get. 
[00:45:30]  I think the fucking batteries only do three or four in a lot of cases.  Yeah.  Why is that?  I don't know.  It's pretty fucking...  My car's not that old.  It's a little over three, I think.  Three and a half, maybe, at this point.  Should last longer than that.  I think so.  Yeah.  But the guy was cool.  His bread I had to throw away.  I couldn't trust the bread he gave me for the shelters.  I hope he refuses to eat the bread of a Negro.  I will not eat the Negro's bread.  Let the record show that it was the Negro that helped me, though. 
[00:46:00]  All those white fucking assholes that I live among.  Yeah, they're busy going to work.  It was a Saturday.  Oh, see how fucking motivated?  Exactly.  They were helping people in need.  Your racism has no bounds.  It was a Saturday.  But all these fucking white assholes, not one would even acknowledge I was there.  Pieces of shit.  I'm not sure.  Am I too old for this to be happening?  What is it?  Can you see that on my sheets?  You got cum all of them? 
[00:46:30]  No.  All over them?  Duty?  Did you make wee-wees?  I can't see the picture.  You made wee-wees in your bed overnight?  You wet the bed?  You wet your bed?  I wet my bed.  No, you did.  Yes, I did.  Were you dreaming that you were peeing?  No, look, it's a good close-up of the bed.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  That's a lot of wee-wee.  You made pee-pees.  Did you wake up?  Yeah, you're too old for that.  No, when Kenny called, I woke up and I realized, oh, I'm wet.  Has this happened recently?  Not in a few years. 
[00:47:00]  What the fuck is going on?  Jimmy made wet.  Did he take a sleeping pill or anything in that shit?  No, I took a valerian root, which are dirty.  That's organic sleeping shit.  Yeah, but those are totally...  But it might have knocked you down enough where, you know, you didn't know what the  fuck you were doing.  Oh, Jimmy.  You just started taking that shit?  I've been taking it for a little while.  I mean, it helps me sleep.  That with my mouth guard.  Like, if I lay down and I use that, my mouth guard and my chin strap...  You use a dick guard.  ...so my fucking mouth doesn't open, I can usually lay sleep through the night. 
[00:47:30]  You've got to clamp around your cock when you're sleeping.  Valerian root is a totally organic, natural root.  Yes, it is.  Okay.  I was on it, and I'm allergic to trees and grass, and for some reason that thing didn't  help me.  It made me sweat like a motherfucker.  It doesn't affect me negatively at all.  I had to get off that shit.  But it put me down.  I was able to sleep.  But it's not any type of a sleeping pill.  No, I don't think so.  I think it's the basic shit that they might use in sleeping pills or something.  I don't know.  So Dr. Steve would be able to explain it better.  Oh, oh.  It'll make you at the bed. 
[00:48:00]  Some fluids on your sheet.  Yeah, it loosens up your bladder.  So you've got a mask, a chin strap, and you're peeing yourself.  I can't get used to the mask, dude, because the doctors won't listen to me.  I told them I need a different machine, and they're not listening.  No one listens.  They don't listen.  The BiPAP is not working.  I can't get used to it.  And even when I do doze off, I wake up gasping.  This is a mouth guard, which pushes my jaw out.  And then I put a chin strap on to keep my mouth from opening. 
[00:48:30]  And when I do that, if your mouth opens, that's when my tongue will usually slide back.  So I keep it.  It's actually not nearly as bad.  It's a single strap around, like a retard fucking mumps thing.  But it does.  When I have that on, I'm tired.  I can fall asleep like that.  Yeah.  And then days like this, sometimes the shin strap is gone.  But I wake up a lot of times six, seven hours later.  But we've heard all that before.  I'm still tired.  I want to know about you peeing your bed. 
[00:49:00]  I guess I had to go.  And when you woke up.  But that's a lot of pee.  Yes, it is.  That's a full pee.  No, no, no, no.  I woke up having to piss, too.  It probably just a lot of it leaked out of my fucking, my impressive boner.  Did you clean it up before you left?  No, I just was like, oh, great.  I was actually happy when I saw it because it meant that I fucking slept through the night.  I was happy when I saw piss on the bed.  You were?  Yeah.  Because it meant that I wasn't up and down all night.  Are the sheets still on the bed?  Yeah.  Fuck do I care?  Is our cleaning lady going to have to deal with that today? 
[00:49:30]  No, she came yesterday.  Next week, she'll take them off.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding, right?  No.  You can't leave pissy sheets in a pissy mattress.  Watch me.  Really?  Yeah.  Of course.  Why wouldn't you just take the sheets off?  For what?  Well, because.  It'll dry and I'll just go to bed.  I don't care.  Are you being serious?  100%.  You don't want it to be pissy, though.  What kind of pee is it, though?  I mean, if you're drinking a lot of water.  Water piss.  It's not.  Water piss is easy.  It's not asparagus.  Yeah, I'll lay around in water piss.  That's easy.  Like a cat? 
[00:50:00]  No.  Lay around in water piss?  Yeah, it's easy because it's clear and shit.  No, you've got to clean that up.  When it's that pee that is yellow to that almost orange-y color, I wouldn't lay around  in that shit.  Oh, my God.  Dude, it didn't even occur.  Water piss is easy.  I just took a picture of it.  I'm like, oh, cool.  You've got to sop that shit up.  No, it wasn't that much.  It was damp.  Yeah?  I actually laid over on it and rolled over and went back to sleep for a few minutes.  Did he put a towel over it at least?  No.  For what?  Oh, my God.  That I don't understand.  I had to get to work.  No, for what?  Can we get E-Rock on the phone for an update before we go to break? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, my God.  Please?  That is a nice picture there, Jimmy.  You learn, you know.  But then I was thinking how many times I've passed someone over that needed a little help.  Of course.  But I've helped the people that it's so obvious they're a little more desperate than usual.  Yeah.  You know.  I'll fucking...  Because I was getting so mad, but I'm thinking, would I have stopped for that for me?  I don't know.  No.  If it was a girl that needed help, she needed cum in her mouth, had stopped. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Well, you know what, if she's a hot broad, I think you stop every time.  Yeah, then you stop.  Perhaps.  I was just trying to figure that out.  Like, would I?  I think if it was a mom with a kid on the side of the road, yes.  Definitely not.  Oh.  I guess it depends on who the person is, right?  I don't know.  But then there are people that will stop every fucking time.  You guys are heroes.  Not in a second.  Not at all.  I probably wouldn't even notice.  Dude, I was out there over an hour with not one person stopping or not one person even 
[00:51:30]  acknowledging that I was having an issue.  And it's very rare on Columbus Avenue to see someone with their hood up and jumper cables  in their hands.  Like, look how...  It's the easiest thing you could do for me.  Yeah, no one wants to help.  A jump takes, what, 10 seconds?  Maybe.  As long as there's no fucking problems.  That's the worst thing.  But that's why I was holding the jumper cables.  Like, look, I'm telling all you people, none of you fuckers that are looking at me, it's  the easiest thing you could do for a human being.  Even your friends don't want to help you jump your car. 
[00:52:00]  Never mind strangers.  Yeah.  I just pressed that fucking OnStar button.  Hello.  How you doing?  Yep.  Here's where I am.  Hey, how you doing?  True.  Or AAA.  Something like that.  Let me say hi to E-Rock again.  E-Rock.  So we see the picture you tweeted.  E-Rock Radio.  Your car is...  You're right.  It's in the middle of the street.  But we're really mad at you because the car is now at a 90-degree angle from where it  was in your driveway.  So you obviously were able to turn the steering wheel. 
[00:52:30]  Why couldn't you keep turning it to get it into that spot?  I missed your opportunity.  Yeah.  You're about five feet off the curb.  E-Rock?  No, I mean, where the car was was in the center of the street.  Yeah, I know, but...  I was trying to angle it for across the street, and it didn't go that way.  So where is it now?  Right now, I have the car moved, and it's across the street.  How'd you do it?  Well, I got a neighbor who was about eight or nine months pregnant to come out. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, my God.  She sat in the car and steered it while I got my car out and pushed it across the street.  What about the wife?  Why wouldn't the wife do that job instead of the nine-month pregnant woman?  Well, the neighbor I wanted to help isn't answering, and she came out and saw me out  here and said, do you need any help?  And I said, sure.  And I explained the situation, and she helped out.  But why wouldn't you ask your wife?  Why wouldn't you ask your wife?  What kind of marriage is this? 
[00:53:30]  What kind of what?  Why wouldn't you ask your wife to help?  Why wouldn't you ask your wife?  I did, and she said, I'm busy getting ready to go to work.  Wait, she left you with your car in the middle of the street?  Doesn't that trump everything?  Like, all right, well, I got to get our family car out of the street.  Well, she's an important person.  She's got things to do.  Oh, man.  She is a very important person.  Man.  She's certainly a VIP.  You know, there's blasting on Route 3 today, too. 
[00:54:00]  You know that, right?  Blasting?  Yeah, there were blasting from 4.30 in the morning.  Maybe they stopped by now.  I don't know.  Iraq, any damage from the vehicle contact?  Well.  There has to be.  That's never good.  Those bumpers, bumpers, we don't even have bumpers anymore, really.  They never match up.  Anything?  So you just scrape the shit out of the back of your car.  It'll need some detailing.  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  A little bit. 
[00:54:30]  What are you going to do?  Why don't you just fold up a towel and put it in between there?  Because I would never think of that.  Holy shit.  So, are you coming to work now?  That's great.  Yep.  I'm going to...  Do you think you officially saved your day?  Oh.  Because Sam pointed out to everyone, you love saving your days.  You collect things.  You collect your days. 
[00:55:00]  No.  The Opie and Anthony show saved my day.  Oh.  Wow.  Just get to work, cocksucker.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  I told him.  Stop fucking...  Fuck you too, cocksucker, leaving your car in the street.  I hope a fucking milk truck kills you.  Milk truck.  Why am I a milk truck?  Here is this.  Iraq?  Yeah.  You get the final word.  Iraq?  Come on.  I will see you guys soon.  All right.  Iraq!  Iraq!  I love how we have to waste an hour of our show just to get him to come to work. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Because he would not have come to work.  Got to talk him in like a fucking passenger with a pilot guy.  Right.  It's always some weird little thing with that guy.  Black History Month.  We're going to go to break with another invention.  Oh, I want to hear this.  I was talking to some people yesterday, Sam Roberts.  A lot of people are thinking that these inventions are just made up for black history.  Absolutely not.  We are here to say these are actual inventions made by black guys. 
[00:56:00]  Really?  The curtain rod?  Yes.  I wanted to make sure that these were...  They don't have to be entertaining as long as they're informative.  It's true.  All the information.  All these inventions are true.  Absolutely.  And the guy...  I mean, what am I making up names?  The inventors are in there.  So you can Google this shit?  Absolutely.  I bet it was out of necessity, the curtain rod.  I bet like the plantation owner, as it was, was beating him with something, and he just  decided to hang curtains with everything he could possibly hit him with. 
[00:56:30]  I mean...  It's like, yeah, that's good.  Give me that.  You heard this scenario.  Well, yeah.  Well, I did.  Yeah.  The guy had a broomstick.  He couldn't keep his velvet curtains up.  Uh-huh.  And people are loving that you're using DJ Who Kid.  Did they tell it was him?  Oh, I thought that was really, like, historical audio.  So here's today's black invention for Black History Month.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of the  great African-American inventors.  Today, we honor F.J. 
[00:57:00]  Loudon, inventor of the keychain.  Yo, what are your pockets?  What?  Give me the shit.  It's in your pockets, nigga.  Eh, excuse me?  People get mugged in 1894?  What the fuck up?  Give me that money, nigga.  I don't have any.  I hear that shit jingling, jingle jangle.  Those are my keys, loose and strewn about in my pockets.  Loose?  You need to get one of these.  Get your shit tight.  That's brilliant.  A ring that keeps all your keys together?  Well, you ain't got no guap. 
[00:57:30]  Your wife is coming with me, kid.  Absolutely not.  I...  Nah, it's okay.  I'll go.  What?  Yeah, homie.  The Keychain.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whoa, shit!  The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  That's pretty goddamn good, man.  Everyone knows Steven Singer.  It's the best place in the country to buy a diamond. 
[00:58:00]  But a lot of people forget that Steven's also the best place to go for Valentine's Day.  Steven's got...  He's always coming up with good, great actual gift ideas for Valentine's Day.  You know what's going to blow her away this Valentine's Day?  Something special.  No one else has it.  Something's going to make her friends go, wow!  Sky Blue Diamonds.  Yes, that's right.  Sky Blue Diamonds.  Steven's new Sky Blue Diamond collection.  It's not only unique and beautiful, but it's affordable, too.  How much do you think a Blue Diamond would cost you?  One hundred? 
[00:58:30]  Two hundred?  Three hundred?  Eighty hundred?  A thousand?  Twelve hundred?  A million?  Billion dollars?  Well, our best-selling Sky Blue Diamonds at the heart is just $299.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to check it out.  You don't have to move.  Go online.  Go to IhateStevenSinger.com.  Check out the brand-new collection of...  That's where the copy ends, by the way.  Check out the brand new collection of 
[00:59:00]  It doesn't say anything about the other corner  Ethan Walnut  Why isn't it fixed today?  Why isn't it fixed?  What happened?  Check out his brand new collection of Sky Blue Diamonds  I'm just going to wing it now  Why wouldn't it be fixed?  This was the same problem we had yesterday  Oh, Steven Singer Jewelers  It's just $299  By the way, Steven offers free shipping  And it's a 100% money back guarantee  And like I said, you don't have to move  Just go to IHateStevenSinger.com  On the phone, it's 888-IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER 
[00:59:30]  I just want to ask  Do we have to officially tell the radio wizard  He has to fix the copy?  Maybe that's it  We got an email yesterday  From Rob  Just informing us that the copy was not fixed  What do you mean?  Just a heads up  Tomorrow, the copy is not fixed  Why would he just fucking fix it?  Isn't it?  I don't know  And I didn't get a chance to write copy this morning  While I was doing work for the show 
[01:00:00]  Jimmy has finally fucking described this place  We are stuck in the mud  Why would you send out an email to warn everyone  That the copy is not officially fixed?  Why wouldn't you just fix it?  Yeah  I don't know  What is missing from that copy?  A phone number maybe?  A website?  The last sentence and a half  It's like the brand new collection of  But what would be there?  Sky Blue Diamonds  Talk about his money back guarantee  100% free delivery  Other eight corners of Walnut  Time for Valentine's Day  Yeah, other corners of eight and Walnut  In all fairness to Rob 
[01:00:30]  And the rest of the dummies down the hall  This is a new sponsor  And no one has a real feel  For what Steven Singer  Is selling  Right, right  Or how to get his shit  So fair enough  Fair enough  He's the only guy  Who supports our show  And they can't get the copy right  And they send out a thing  Saying hey the copy's not right  I don't know what machine  We might fix it on  Perhaps the one I'm sending  The email on  How fucking hard is that?  Fix the fucking copy  Cocksucker  That's why  Nothing moves here 
[01:01:00]  Exactly  Nothing  That's why we have to  Bring it up every day  It's mind boggling  We have this middle management shit  That sends out emails  To say that the copy's  Still not fair  It's like doing radio  In the La Brea fucking tar pits  Why would you send out an email?  Why wouldn't you just fix it?  Fix it  Right  Even if it's a temporary solution  Where you use your stupid brain  And go well I must have heard  Steven Singer's commercials  Probably about a thousand times  Right 
[01:01:30]  So I think I could do this for bottom  Yes  What time did that email go out Sam?  Last night sometime  What time?  I saw it this morning  Was it 5.50 in the morning this morning?  When I saw it?  Meaning did he send it out that late?  So whenever he sent it out  There were still hours to fix it  Right  He sent it about 6 o'clock last night  So that's 12 hours ago  Oh my god  To add a paragraph  No one fixed it  Let me see that  It's  He's saying  I just got a word  I got a word from Travis  Yeah  He's suggesting 
[01:02:00]  That you stop reading after .com  So just kill the  And view the brand new collection of  Well  Why would I do that?  That's what Steven paid for  But wait a minute  You can't just make his copy shorter  Like they do pay for  Like a read of a certain length  And it's not mentioning  The other corner of 8th and Walnut  Everyone knows  It's the other corner of 8th and Walnut  It's IHateStevenSinger.com  It doesn't mention  His money back guarantee  Or his free shipping  And everyone knows  The phone number by now  Yes  888-IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER  So all he had to do 
[01:02:30]  Was add all that  And then we wouldn't have  To discuss this  And we wouldn't have to discuss  How useless these guys are  Again  And the other part  His prices are  Insane  Exactly  That should be on the bottom  Exactly  Crazy Steven  And why doesn't  Or why didn't he just go to  The fucking lump in sales  That did this  And then had a mini stroke  And handed it in  And say fucking finish it  Finish it  This says a lot about this place  Someone actually typed this out  And went  Ah good enough  Yeah  Do they even proofread their shit?  No  I mean it's two days in a row 
[01:03:00]  Of multiple  Two days in a row  It's our only sponsor  Of course we don't have  Any other sponsors  Of course  It just ends right there  I wouldn't fucking advertise  With this shithole  If this is how  Clients are taken care of  Oh my god  Man  And you'll never get an answer  As to who it was  Never  No  How about we get an answer today  Who was it?  How about we get an answer today  Ah these things  They come from sales  What is sales?  Is sales a floating thing?  Yes  Like that fucking  That circles the planet 
[01:03:30]  That fucking Marshall White Apple  Wanted to go to  What is it?  Can you imagine  You're a business  And you decide  I'm gonna  I'm gonna advertise  With the Super Bowl  And then their spot  Just fucking ends  It ends  You think that would  Ever happen?  They're all sitting there  And then all of a sudden  It just ends  And then there's no one  To figure it out  And it's a sponsor  That we've heard  So many times  And we're sick of them  So it's obvious  What is missing here  And you can't take  Responsibility yourself  And go  I know what's missing here  So I will write 
[01:04:00]  The rest of the copy  And then I will  Check with sales  When I get to work  Whenever the fuck  I get to work  To make sure everything's set  We couldn't have just  Called someone last night  It's called a temporary solution  Not a  I'll send an email  To tell everyone  It's still not fixed  But why at 6pm  Wasn't it fixed?  Like we read it yesterday  It went 7am  Why wasn't it fixed  In 11 hours  Now 24 hours later  24 hours  How hard is it  To finish a fucking paragraph?  Yeah  You know  You know the basic  Gist of the 
[01:04:30]  Steven Singer commercials  And if you don't  You listen back  I would listen back  Dude  To a read that we did yesterday  And go  Okay that's what's missing  From this  Just a little effort  I bet you  Yeah  We could get  One of our listeners  On the phone right now  Oh yeah  We'd read this copy  And just go  What do you think's missing?  Yeah  And they would tell you  They'd be like  Oh the other corner  They would tell you  Yeah  The other corner thing  They don't even need  To know exactly  They're like  Well I think you mentioned  Something about the other corner  Corner in Philly  And obviously 
[01:05:00]  There's no phone number  So you'd probably add that  He's got a money back guarantee  I've heard that  And if he's saying  View the brand new collection of  It's probably what you've been talking about  Which is the Sky Blue Diamonds  What is the last sentence?  What is the last sentence?  I don't know this copy  Okay  I can't read it  Because you might fucking  No no no  How does it end?  I can probably see if I can finish it  Remember  Go online to  IHateStevenSinger.com  And view the brand new collection of  Of Steven Singer's great stuff  You can see them  Steven Singer's got all of his stuff  In Las Vegas 
[01:05:30]  At the MGM  He'll be selling it with  Jim Morton  And Dave Attell  February 22nd and 23rd  Oh that makes sense  That's what they left out  And I know those guys  Walk around all mopey  Because they get such a beating  From us  But this is why you get a beating  You can't even do  The basic shit  Does anybody  In this place  Have fucking passion  For making the product  No  Good  No  It's like working at Bradley's  Or fucking Corvette's  Oh you did that  Yes I did  No one had passion 
[01:06:00]  Did you like going in every day  Because you knew it was going to  I didn't give a shit  That's the point  I didn't give a shit  Right  About product  Or whether the fucking  The pants were folded properly  If no one was looking  I'd take a sweater  And ball it up  And throw it under the fucking  Under the display  Of course  Why wouldn't you  These guys literally have  One of ten radio jobs

[01:17:00]  It's your birthday.  It's your birthday.  Axl Rose, 51.  Rick Ashley, 47.  The only reason I'm mentioning birthdays today.  Zsa Zsa Gabor?  Yeah.  Last we checked, wasn't she down to just a head?  Didn't they cut off most of her limbs?  Yeah, yeah.  She's not alive, right?  It's your birthday.  96 today.  Zsa Zsa Gabor.  Chopped her fucking leg off.  I don't know.  They've been chopping. 
[01:17:30]  They've been lopping off body parts for a while.  Man.  It's your birthday.  I thought she was a goner.  So you went down the hall, Sam.  People love when you go down the hall to talk to the radio wizard.  We have a copy here from I Hate Steven Singer, and it's very embarrassing because he's here  today, and his copy just ends.  Yeah.  And there was an email that was sent out last night saying that the copy is still a problem.  I just want to bring that to your attention.  Here, it's not fixed yet.  And we're under the assumption that it probably should have been fixed by today's show, considering 
[01:18:00]  it was about 22 hours ago that we brought it up to everybody.  Yeah.  You know what that actually is?  It's as if there's a broken window at your house.  Right.  And he wrote a message about how the window is still broken on a brand new window.  Right.  And brought that to your house.  Right.  Here.  Here's the problem.  But you could have fixed it with the email.  So we were ready to move on, but certainly Sam has an update because we told him to go 
[01:18:30]  talk to the radio wizard.  Yeah.  Because at this point, we refused to talk to the guy.  Why would we?  We'll have little chit chats and a little light conversation with the guy after the show,  but I'm not fucking talking to him about anything anymore.  No.  So what happened, Sam?  He doesn't know why the copy was still messed up because Rob Cross handles the copy.  But he handles, he oversees everybody.  Oh.  So wouldn't he like follow up and go, Rob, so is that copy thing fixed?  Oh.  I mean, I guess.  I don't know.  And why wouldn't he fix it? 
[01:19:00]  Why wouldn't Gary fix it?  Yeah.  Oh, that's way above, below him.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, he said it's a Rob Cross.  So he's saying Rob Cross fucked this up.  That's the name?  When I said I wanted a name to this, so I could go on record by saying Rob Cross fucked up.  Rob Cross is the go-to guy when it comes to dealing with sales and live reads.  And what was the thing where, you know, it was mentioned just cut it off at, you know, right before that sentence that is not finished, which means we would leave out the phone number where the damn place is located. 
[01:19:30]  What was his answer to that?  He said he could only assume because he doesn't know this, but he could, but based on his previous dealings, that the way that you guys said you can't cut off the copy because the client wouldn't be happy, they, the sales department would operate under the same assumption that if you added to the copy without the client's approval, they would be equally.  It's Stephen fucking Singer.  And the sales department is the one that wrote this copy. 
[01:20:00]  It's Stephen Singer.  Do they only write it to of?  Is that where Stephen said?  Stop it on of.  We've basically have called him a cunt during his live reads.  I think he would be fine if we just kind of willy-nilly made it up for him.  Holy fuck.  Oh, well.  We got Jimmy Fallon checking in today.  He's going to be calling in about 20 minutes, Mr. Fallon.  He never forgot us, man.  He's still right there with us, and we appreciate that. 
[01:20:30]  Kurt Metzger's on his show tonight.  Kurt?  Yeah, he's funny.  Kurt Metzger is very funny.  I did Bobby's podcast with him.  We got to get him back on the show.  He's done our show.  Kurt Metzger on Jimmy Fallon tonight.  Make sure you check that out.  Very cool.  Ooh.  Are we supposed to get snow?  I don't know.  It's winter.  I just saw a weird weather map that looked bad.  It looked like really a lot of snow.  We better shut down this fucking show and get home to our loved ones. 
[01:21:00]  Well, not today, but we'll see.  A foot of snow.  Really?  For the northeast, but where?  Yeah, that northeast is a big area.  It is.  But it did kind of.  I think it was the weekend, like Friday or something, right?  Friday's weather.  Right.  Friday.  Rain, snow.  Oh, forget it.  That's Friday, Sunday, Tuesday, Monday, Wednesday.  That means north and west of the city will have accumulations.  Oh, yeah.  That's what that says right there.  And that's all you need to know.  There's your weather.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, fuckers.  Oh, we got Joel McHale coming in today.  Very nice.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Another guy that has never forgotten about us.  That's good.  We like that a lot.  Yeah.  I don't hear about the teen and the judge.  The one that was flipping the bird?  Fucking classic.  Yeah.  Do you have the video, or should I play it from here?  There is video.  I want to see the video.  Oh, it's classic.  They've been playing it on the news this morning, but I haven't heard the audio.  I saw the video.  Right.  She's a little bitch that decides she's going to flip the judge off. 
[01:22:00]  Right.  He doesn't take kindly to that.  But, Lindsay, this is amazing to me.  Like, this girl's obviously snotty.  But Lindsay Lohan has fucking been such a pig for so long, and she never goes to jail.  No.  How is this the same system?  I think they're giving this little girl, because she flipped the finger, 30 days.  Yeah.  Yeah.  30 days in the hole.  And Lindsay Lohan is, yeah, Jimmy's right, has done all sorts of shit.  She should easily be doing 30 days, if not a lot more. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, it doesn't make sense.  Let's see.  Oh, could you pull that?  Dot com.  Good morning, Minnesota.  You'll be in charge of possession of Xanax.  Xanax.  B-A-R-S.  I don't know what that is.  What is it?  Xanax.  Xanax bar.  She's laughing.  Pause.  Xanax bar.  Oh, boy.  The judge doesn't know what Xanax is?  Xanax.  He's old.  Xanax bars.  Huh?  Xanax bars.  Those are the big three milligram ones.  He didn't know what Xanax bars were. 
[01:23:00]  Where is this?  Florida.  Wait, what's a Xanax bar?  I don't know that either.  That's the big three milligram ones that you snap, get one, get two, or you could just take  the whole three.  And what happens with the whole three?  Woo-hoo.  Rock and roll?  Woo-hoo.  Rock and roll.  You'll be like all fucked up and shit.  She's smiling, too.  Yeah, she'd be laughing.  She's having a good time in court.  All right.  I understand you have a candy.  Do you look for $2,000 service?  Yes.  You're in the lead.  No objection.  She has no priors. 
[01:23:30]  She's being charged per pill, which is improper.  It should just be one count.  Ms. Soto, are you working?  Yes.  How much money are you making a week, approximately?  Approximately about $200 a week.  Okay.  And do you own any property of value, a house, a car, a bank account, significant amounts  of jewelry?  Yes.  What do you own?  I own a lot of jewelry, all right.  A lot of jewelry.  As well as a car.  How much would you say your jewelry is worth? 
[01:24:00]  It's not a joke, you know.  Oh, my gosh.  She's just saying.  We are not in a club.  Be serious about it.  I'm serious about it.  You just say me laugh.  I can see you're serious, all right.  You just made me laugh.  I apologize.  It's all right.  How much is your jewelry worth?  It's worth a lot of money.  Like what?  Like Rick Ross.  Huh?  She's like Rick Ross?  Yeah.  She is a dummy. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, wow.  Is she stupid?  Nice.  It's worth money.  Have you had any kind of drugs in the last 24 hours?  Oh, my gosh.  Actually, no.  Actually, no?  Judge, I'll make it easy for the court respectfully.  I'll accept the appointment at this time.  No, no.  I'm going to appoint you because you own a lot of substantial amounts of jewelry.  You can go and sell your jewelry.  Jewelry for a private attorney.  What is the standard bond? 
[01:25:00]  It's going to be no PTS.  Okay, $5,000 on count one, and then the rest should be our own.  Wait, pause that real quick.  Did he say you can go sell your jewelry for a private attorney?  For a private attorney.  So he won't give her a...  They won't give her a public defender.  She's got a real case here.  He's trying to help her out a little bit.  He's fucking her by doing that.  He's fucking her.  Yeah.  He's fucking her because he's saying we're not going to give you a free lawyer.  He goes, you got a car?  You got jewelry?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, so this is a hearing to get some... 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, but she's handling this terribly.  I apologize.  Oh, is she ever.  Oh, boy.  Because this judge, you know, he's not trying to...  She's just fucking this up.  She really is fucking this up.  If she was cool, he probably would have said,  oh, fuck, we'll get you an attorney.  Maybe, yeah.  Or she said, that's not worth that much.  Right.  Okay.  But if she has Rick Ross-level jewelry, she'll be able to afford to turn buying now.  What is Rick Ross-level jewelry?  I mean, Rick Ross is a boss, so he's got, like, a lot of jewelry. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, he's got, like, fucking $500 worth of rings and stuff.  Oh, hell yeah.  Fucking money.  Somewhat more than that.  Oh, hell yeah.  Bye-bye.  Adios.  Uh-oh.  He's laughing.  Come back, man.  Come back.  Oh, shit.  See?  Pause.  Come back.  Give me his paper.  She was done.  She was done.  And he laughed.  Uh-oh.  But then he's thinking, wait, I'm laughing.  I'm laughing, but I am the judge's guy.  He hates her.  Now I gotta fucking do something.  Oh, boy.  Is he like... 
[01:26:30]  But he was laughing.  He sounds like an accent.  Is he like an old Cuban or a Spanish guy?  Yeah.  He is.  He's a guy that doesn't fuck around.  He's definitely a Spanish dude.  And what is she?  She's Hispanic.  Hispanic-ish.  They both seem maybe Cuban.  All right.  Let's go.  Judge brings her back.  Do it again.  Now she's got her hands up like, oh, my God.  Count one would be 10,000.  Oh, shit.  Wait, pause.  What?  Count one.  $10,000 bail.  Yeah.  He just bumped the bail up way high. 
[01:27:00]  What was it originally?  Five.  Five grand.  Now it's 10 grand.  Oh, now she's like, what the fuck?  Now she's all serious and shit.  I guess he didn't like her kind of laughing going, adios.  Right.  She's being a little cunt.  Right.  Go back slightly.  Oh, man.  We'll let it roll out.  Oh, man.  Come back, man.  Come back.  Come back.  Oh, shit.  Here comes the hammer.  Give me the paper again.  Hammer.  Count one would be 10,000. 
[01:27:30]  People laughing.  Are you serious?  I am serious.  Adios.  And he just gave her the pause.  Come back again.  Oh, shit.  This is why everyone's talking about the video as a visual.  So he says adios, you know, mocking her adios.  And as she walks away, she gives the fucking finger.  Flips him the bird and says, fuck you. 
[01:28:00]  Did she say fuck you?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  And why is this all beeped out?  It's on media.  All the news stuff.  Yeah, I checked around.  They may get it that way from the court.  It's either beeped or completely dumped out.  Wow.  So now he's like, come back again.  Oh, he's not going to be happy now.  Nope.  If he wasn't happy with adios.  Nope.  He is not going to be happy with flipping the bird and the fuck you.  Oh.  Come back again.  Everyone's laughing.  Bring her back again. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now she's not smiling.  What's up?  I believe I heard you saying to.  Yes, I did.  I'm not going to.  I believe you.  Did you say.  Yes, sir.  F*** me.  Actually, I did.  Did you say that?  Yes, sir.  I did.  Oh, you did say that?  I find you in direct criminal contempt.  30 days in the county jail.  Okay.  That's fine.  30 days in the county jail.  I believe that she's represented by the public.  It's not being represented by the public.  Big defender.  Okay.  And no public defender?  Mm-hmm.  You said no public defender. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Gotta use some of that Rick Ross fucking jewelry money.  You say fuck you to a judge.  Like she, she couldn't, she couldn't have dug her hole any deeper by being a cunt.  You know what?  When you, when you're in those situations in court, believe me, you don't want to fucking,  you don't want to sit there and fucking have to eat shit, but that's the position you're  in.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  Yes, your honor.  You fucking sit there.  You smile.  Thank you for fucking me over.  Wow.  She really fucking dropped the ball there. 
[01:29:30]  Wouldn't she have been out with $5,000 in bail and, and, uh, or $5,000 bail and, and  fucking, uh, a public defender if she wasn't so stupid.  She wasn't a dummy.  Um, is there anything else left on that?  Not.  Whatever.  That was pretty much it.  Yeah.  Damn.  Uh.  That judge, uh, he didn't want any of her shit.  I don't want any of your fucking shit.  You think that attitude is going to serve her well in jail for 30 days?  Mm-hmm.  She'll probably do okay in jail with that attitude. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Probably fight.  So what would it have been?  No jail time.  No jail time.  I mean, she would have been in.  $5,000 to get, uh, bail.  Now, then it went to $10,000 and now 30 days in jail.  And $10,000.  Yeah.  And no more.  $10,000.  $10,000.  It was about $1,000 cash she'd been out with.  Yeah.  Did she do the 30 days, though?  Oh, yeah.  She'll do all 30, you think?  Sure.  Yeah, and they said.  A month.  A month.  He wasn't giving her time served.  Wow. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, he said that?  Mm-hmm.  He, uh, didn't like her.  Oh, wow.  No, she was being a little snot, and he fucking smashed her.  She's going to have her fucking face buried in some big fat bitch's pussy.  They'll like her, huh?  Oh, yeah.  You like that, don't you?  You like that?  Fucking lick me, you fool.  How about this piece of shit guard?  This woman in New York.  Oh, yeah.  Who fucked this guy.  What was his name?  I'm going by Ronnell Wilson.  I said, I want to think this fucking animal, this savage who shot two undercover cops during 
[01:31:00]  a drug buy in Staten Island, or a gun buy, I'm sorry.  And he knew they were cops, and he killed them anyway.  Yeah.  And he's got, they're fighting the death penalty.  He got the death penalty, but of course, there's a technicality that overturned it, so now he's  back in Brooklyn.  Nolan, I'm sorry, let me get to his name.  Well, the death penalty is never going to be used in New York State anytime soon.  Right now, Wilson.  Right now, Wilson.  So this fucking, this animal is in jail, and hopefully he'll be killed.  Jail guard Nancy Gonzalez is eight months pregnant with this guy's kid. 
[01:31:30]  She fucked him in jail because he wanted a baby.  She's facing 15 years.  For doing that?  Yeah.  And she won't get it, of course, but she should get something.  I remember that piece of shit.  Let me see.  I remember that story.  God.  Yeah.  She wants some dick.  I can't, I literally can't get a fucking girl to call me back.  This guy shoots two cops, and he can knock a girl up in jail.  How the fuck, what kind of rap does he have?  That's pretty amazing.  Doesn't she just back her ass up against the bars? 
[01:32:00]  How is that done?  She probably opens the doors.  Yeah, it's sexy if you think she's fucking backing up to the bars like a fucking cat in heat.  Unbelievable.  She has a $53,000, $54,000 a year job, and she's been doing it since 2009.  What a dummy.  Mm-hmm.  What is that supposed to mean?  He's retarded.  What?  Jimmy.  This, oh, it's Adam from the UK, this guy, yeah. 
[01:32:30]  Jimmy's little Disneyland world must be a fun place to live.  Why is my world Disneyland?  I don't know.  Let's see.  He knew they were, ha-ha, Jimmy.  He knew they were cops, and he killed them anyway.  No, Jimmy, because.  I guess because they were cops?  No, it was, um, I don't know if he killed them because they were cops.  He was in the car, meaning it was a drug by, uh, I don't know all the details whether he knew before he got in the car. 
[01:33:00]  But the point I'm making is, uh-huh.  Uh, I wasn't being naive, stupid.  Of course.  What I was saying was it wasn't like this was an undercover who came to buy something and he just shot him and it was an undercover.  Yeah.  He was aware that he was dealing with two cops.  Right.  So whether it's because they were cops is irrelevant.  He knew they were cops when he killed them.  Yeah, yeah.  So to me that makes him very eligible for the death penalty.  That's kind of the point.  But we don't use the death penalty in New York.  Never.  We've had it for a very fucking long time.  No, it's ridiculous.  Used it once.  It's a joke. 
[01:33:30]  It is.  It was just to calm everyone down.  They knew when they passed that legislation they would actually not use it.  Fuckies.  I don't know what you have to do for them to actually use the death penalty in New York State.  We've had some horrific shit go down and we haven't used it once.  And we do this every time.  It's been how long?  Well over 10 years.  15 years, I think.  Please.  I think it's been about 15 years.  Long ass time.  Maybe you can look that up, Sam.  How long the New York State has had the death penalty we haven't used it once.  Since Pataki was elected.  It's a joke.  When Pataki was elected. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  Why pass the legislation if you know damn well you're never going to use it?  Yeah.  It's a joke.  Either we have it and you use it or let's all be honest with each other and say,  well, this state doesn't want it.  It's so politicians can say, look, we're tough on crime.  Meanwhile, they're not because they don't do anything.  Yeah.  Yeah, 95.  95.  All right.  So that's pushing 18 years.  Gee.  And we haven't used it once.  No.  Stupid.  In 1963 was the last time capital punishment went down in New York. 
[01:34:30]  Was used in New York State?  Who was that guy?  When Eddie Mays was electrocuted at Sing Sing.  Imagine being the last guy.  That's 50 years ago.  We haven't used it in 50 years.  I know a bunch of years there we didn't have it at all.  But we've now had it on the books for 18 years.  Close to 18 years.  Depending on what month, obviously.  And haven't used it once.  Eddie Mays was arrested during a robbery of a bartender and several customers in a bar in Harlem.  Mays shot and killed one of the customers. 
[01:35:00]  Well, that's it.  Just one.  A 31-year-old woman.  We've had horrific shit go down in the last 18 years that beats that.  And he got the chair.  So why haven't we used it?  The chair.  You don't even have to answer that question.  We don't know.  Sweet friends.  Jesus.  Our politicians are a fucking joke.  And now we have today's story of a kid being suspended from school.  He's seven years old.  He's a Colorado.  Colorado boy.  Faces suspension for tossing imaginary grenades.  An imaginary grenade.  You can't even play like that. 
[01:35:30]  It's fucking amazing.  It really is.  Should be a case-by-case basis, obviously.  Of course.  A Colorado second grader may be suspended from his elementary school after he disobeyed a key rule of no weapons,  real or imaginary, when he tossed an imaginary grenade Friday during recess.  And went to indicate that the imaginary device detonated.  He's seven.  Well, you can't allow kids to do that.  He was playing the game Rescue the World.  He plays the role of a heroic soldier out to rid the world of an evil threat.  What a little loser. 
[01:36:00]  You're not a hero.  Shut up.  No, you're not.  You're just throwing an air ball and going, you dumb mouth.  That's saving anyone.  Fuck.  He's a weird kid, but...  Yeah, he's a punk.  It's going to be trouble.  It says his duties let him...  Duties.  Let him to the bathroom.  Let him to throw the imaginary grenade into a box he pretended contained evil forces.  He said he didn't make any threats and was playing by himself.  What a child's game that is.  Oh, my God, right?  A box of evil forces?  What is that?  Just jam.  Why don't you throw the box out?  It's my ex-wife. 
[01:36:30]  A box of evil forces.  Well, they got that absolute law.  So states no weapons, even if they're imaginary.  That's great.  No, no, no.  That's you, it is.  And, of course, then they fucking hide.  They're a bunch of pussies because Fox News called the school and...  Yeah, but then we hate when they do do this stuff.  So we're being hypocritical, or I am today.  Why?  Asking a news question is one thing.  Sometimes I feel like it is, you know, the job of the newsman to fucking ask some questions. 
[01:37:00]  And other times I think it's not.  Yeah, that's my answer.  A phone call Tuesday morning from Fox News to the school is not immediately returned.  Yeah, because that's not vulturous in that situation to call the school.  No, you want more information about what their policy is as to why a child using his imagination is being suspended.  That's retarded.  That's her grenades at everybody when I was a kid.  Oh, fucking grenades and everything.  Oh, yeah.  We did dirt bombs. 
[01:37:30]  No, fake grenades.  I didn't actually throw anything.  We had claymores in the mine and in the lockers.  We used to put little notes in the lock and said, you just set off a claymore.  Boom, you're dead.  Whoa.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking, we'd be fucking expelled for that.  I think you'd get in trouble now if you walked in with a fake machine gun and went, rat-ta-ta-ta, you're on my list.  Oh, boy.  Oh, I think so.  And gunned everybody down, pretend.  Oh, I think you'd be in trouble.  We had water balloons that looked like grenades.  Really?  Like they were literally in the shape and textured like a grenade. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, that sounds fun.  That sounds cool.  It was fun.  They were throwing at each other's head.  Yeah, I just threw a grenade at you and it blew up.  You're all wet now, man.  No one could use their brains or they're too scared to use their brains because then they get fired because they thought they were doing the right thing.  It's just, it's a madhouse out there.  It makes no sense.  After Christmas, we'd get our toys, which would include toy guns and stuff, and you'd bring them into school.  Right.  You'd bring like a toy little dart gun.  You know, those fucking little suction cup dart guns.  You'd bring those to school, water pistols and, you know, in the spring shit like that. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  Why would Jimmy Fallon cancel all press?  He got a bunch of stuff to do.  He's not calling.  No.  He's not calling anybody, though.  Why?  He canceled all his press.  Maybe he has a thing to do in the, uh, maybe there's something in production that had to be redone.  Maybe you're sick.  A thing.  All right.  He's been good.  Fair enough.  Let's go to New Paltz and say hi to Bruce.  Bruce.  Hello.  I'm in New Paltz.  It's not that Bruce.  Oh. 
[01:39:00]  Just getting info on the death penalty.  Go ahead, Bruce.  Yeah, I believe the death penalty is no longer valid in New York.  Spitzer got rid of it.  Yeah, he did.  That's true.  I forgot about that.  How long ago?  Uh, not right, right.  Uh, first day, I think.  It's one of the things he was on his campaign.  Get rid of the death penalty.  Yeah, yeah.  Which is so weird because it was a death penalty where you weren't, ah, just mad at him.  We weren't using it anyway.  So I guess, I guess that in a way is good because why have it if you're not going to use it?  Yeah, what a guy.  That's what I say about my dick. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  What's so bad?  What's so bad about killing these fucking animals that do these horrific things?  There's plenty of people that are more than willing to fucking pull the trigger or fucking  pull the switch.  Right.  And don't give a fuck about their morals.  The criminal didn't give a fuck about their morals.  Oh, whatever.  So stupid.  Doomed.  Doomed destination.  Um.  Hmm. 
[01:40:00]  I guess we got a break anyway.  Oh, man.  Got a lot of live reads to do.  Did you see that fucking news guy that got punched in the face?  I have not seen that.  Oh, by the old guy?  It's fucking beautiful.  I popped that up on all my shit over the weekend.  Yeah, but I keep for some reason on Twitter.  I need to do the other Twitter.  Can I see that?  Because I don't have volume.  So I don't have videos.  Yeah.  I popped that shit up over the weekend now.  But people are saying that old guy is a bad dude.  Well, he probably is.  But I'm like, I don't give a fuck.  I don't care what he did previously or something.  This reporter asked to be punched in the fucking face by doing what he did. 
[01:40:30]  Right.  Wasn't the old guy the guy that the reporter was investigating his father?  Perhaps.  That's who I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, the old guy has a father that's still alive?  No, no.  The old guy who punched the reporter is the father of the guy that was being investigated.  Oh, he's investigating his son.  Wait, wait, wait.  Go backwards.  Oh, my God.  Go back.  Go back.  Hold on.  The video starts with the old man.  He's grabbing the reporter with his left hand by the collar.  He's a big old guy.  He's grabbing Patton Oswalt. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  Looks like Patton Oswalt.  He's at least a fucking head taller than the reporter.  Yeah, this guy is a problem, obviously, but the reporter doesn't realize that, fuck you  and your microphone, I can hit you.  Well, he's got that thing where he thinks he can do whatever he wants, so he's a journalist.  Yeah.  The reporters think the microphone gets him out of problems, I guess.  But they are legit.  Like, it's hard to say until it's a case-by-case, because, again, this might be the guy who needs  to be questioned by the press.  Well, maybe, but watch the circumstance. 
[01:41:30]  Maybe.  Here's the circumstance.  Hit it.  You got your camera on?  Oh, he's balled his fist up.  Don't touch me, sir.  It only cost $25 to bust his man in the mouth.  Sir, who are you?  None of your business.  Then what do you have?  Why are you talking to him?  Don't touch me.  This is assault right now, and we'll call the police if you don't let go.  Let's get him down here.  Your son's facing some pretty serious...  Oh, it's continuing.  The old guy let him go.  The old guy let him go, because he was holding him by his shirt tight, and he had his right  fucking fist all balled up, ready to punch him in the mouth. 
[01:42:00]  And then, yeah, the second the old guy thinks he's got justification,  that's when he lays into it.  Right.  So then he let the guy go, but the reporter, still being ballsy, now follows him back into  his shop or wherever the fuck we're going.  Yeah.  Can't really tell if it's a workplace or not.  Yeah, it's his business.  Okay.  Yeah.  So now the reporter continues to follow.  That's why I love this video.  That's me, too.  Because at that point, he should have just left and figured something else out.  Go ahead, Sam.  Sorry.  In a new place where people don't know you. 
[01:42:30]  Now it looks like he's going to go inside.  We'd like to...  Nope.  Right on his fucking ass, he knocks him.  He's literally...  The old man goes in to, I guess, like Ant said, his business, and the reporter, it's pretty  obvious he's going to follow him inside.  He's going to follow him now inside.  He's not welcome.  And that, then, is entering this guy's fucking property.  And that's when the old guy said, well...  That's it.  Take this.  Take this, motherfucker.  Charges, and you seem to be back in business now.  In a new place where people don't know you. 
[01:43:00]  I'm good.  Would you like to...  Would you like to...  Don't you dare attempt to go in my business.  Don't you dare.  Now you better get your shit and get it gone for that man.  Get here.  Well, we'll be calling police, and you'll be arrested for assault, sir.  You just punched me in the face.  You're trying to get in.  Sir, you were holding the door.  No one invited you in there.  And you didn't tell us not to go in, either.  And you just punched me in the face. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, and I'm going to punch you again.  And then he reaches for his glove.  But that's where the video ends, unfortunately.  That old guy is kind of a...  He'd probably rip people off or something.  I don't know.  He's probably a fucking prick on wheels.  But you know what?  Fuck it.  I love seeing a reporter get a belt in the fucking face every so often.  Absolutely.  That was beautiful.  Good punch by the old codger.  Not bad, right?  Knocked it right on his ass.  That was a strong punch.  Yeah, good for him.  Oh. 
[01:44:00]  I bitched about this mic months ago.  What are you going to do?  It's just...  It's ridiculous.  Your mic fell.  I know.  It falls every day.  You need it.  It literally falls every day.  A stronger mic clip.  I did bitch about it.  It's barely in there.  Nope.  It's barely in there.  I just tap it.  It falls every time.  Oh.  That's ridiculous.  That was something I lost in the war years ago.  Ah.  Gave up on that one years ago.  Look at mine.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I also bitched that the mic just doesn't sound good either, but... 
[01:44:30]  I suggested those for the guest mics, because the guests were constantly pulling the fucking  mic out of the thingy, but they didn't do one to the other guest mic.  Just mine.  Just yours.  I can't be trusted.  You can't be trusted.  But Sam's not the guest.  I know.  That's not the guest spot.  Exactly.  So why...  Can we go to break?  Let's do that.  All right.  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you. 
[01:45:00]  In today's episode, Uncle Paul writes the FCC about MIA's performance during the Super  Bowl halftime show.  To whom it may concern, I would like to see the fuck fine.  The Willie B. Jeepers added her.  That wannabe star Mia.  Her little stunt was not cute. 
[01:45:30]  If she wants to challenge authority, then show her some authority, fuck dudes.  The city of Minneapolis did a great job, as did the Newfoundland, Maddener, and the other  guests who had class.  But this wannabe star that none of us have ever heard of has the gal to come over our home  and enjoy the celebrity of being a star at the Super Bowl just to fly like a bird.  What a disrespectful wrench. 
[01:46:00]  Please show this woman that her cunt was not appreciated.  Eat a B-A-N or F-I-N-E, her.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, cause here comes Uncle Paul.  It's not the same like it was. 
[01:46:30]  Erectile dysfunction has become a serious epidemic.  Pussy is over.  Don't mean nothing no more.  I can't get a hard on.  Take it from legendary comedian and ED sufferer, Pat Cooper.  It's no joke.  I'm not making this shit up.  You're with that gorgeous muffa.  And you're in bed and it don't happen.  Happened to me.  And she goes, what's the matter?  I said, I think it's erectional dysfunction.  She goes, what's that?  I'm fucking dead.  She goes, you mean you can't get it up?  Medication isn't the only option.  I tried Cialis. 
[01:47:00]  I tried Viagra.  I tried everything.  I'm fucking dead.  If you or someone you know is suffering from erectile dysfunction, contact your physician  to explore alternative medical treatments.  I swear to you, I went to a urologist.  He says, how do you feel?  I said, my big thrill is peeing.  I said, when I was getting laid, I said, go, ah, ah.  Now that I pee, I go, ah, ah, ah.  It's the same fucking thing.  It wouldn't have cost me a dime.  Just take it from Pat Cooper.  Don't buy into the erectile dysfunction hype.  Fuck all the bullshit. 
[01:47:30]  Your penis no longer works.  Life as you know it is over.  The doctor said to me, you're fucking dead.  I'm fucking dead.  Series XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Breaking news.  E-Rock Radio has made it to work.  Oh, he did.  8-15.  Why did it take so long?  Where is he? 
[01:48:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why did it take so long?  Uh-oh.  Where is E-Rock?  Because he's a lump.  Wait a minute.  And then I see.  Here he comes.  I see the missus.  Yes.  E-Rock Radio.  All right.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's in.  What happened?  How'd it go?  We were about to get an update from you, but you walked down the hall.  We were hoping that you were still stuck in traffic or something.  Oh, yeah.  What happened after we last left you?  Yeah.  I had pushed the car across the street.  I had met the pregnant lady, right? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Someone pointed out it was two pregnant people pushing the car.  Oh, that's just hurtful.  Somebody said that.  Somebody.  You don't agree.  People are saying.  People are saying.  It was two pregnant people.  And pushed the car there.  Waited for the wife.  We drove in together.  Oh, waited for the wife.  We drove in together.  Waited for the wife.  Nice.  And then just.  I mean, what?  What?  Nice.  Waiting for the wife. 
[01:49:00]  It's already late.  Might as well wait for the wife.  Was she proud of you that you actually resolved the problem?  She was a bit upset.  She was a bit upset that I was saying that she was refusing to help me with the car.  Well, was she?  Oh, yeah.  She was getting ready for work.  Why was she upset?  Well, she didn't really want that known.  What do you do as you waited for your wife to go to work?  Did you get anything done in the house?  Maybe some Lego building?  What do you do?  Yeah.  What do you do?  Make a model?  No.  It didn't take that long.  And then Route 3 and the tunnel was a lot of traffic.  I warned you about Route 3. 
[01:49:30]  I told you there was some blasting today.  Yeah, we told you.  I'm in the know with this shit.  They're taking out a bridge or something.  Enjoyed a bowl of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios.  They make Apple Cinnamon Cheerios.  You've never had them?  He loves them.  Do we have them in the high-yous?  They're so good.  Do we have them in the high-yous?  I don't eat those.  Yeah, you do.  I had Apple Cinnamon Cheerios, really?  No.  I had...  He's making it up.  He loves that.  You love that.  I have a cereal, but I've got like Honey Nut Cheerios and Chex.  Chex?  Rice Chex? 
[01:50:00]  Chex are good, man.  Gotta go Rice Chex every time.  Yeah, Chex are fucking good.  I think they're Rice Chex, but they're Honey Nut Chex.  Of course.  There has to be a little extra.  A little treat?  A little treat.  Sorry, I don't want to...  A little extra.  I don't need to be bland in punishing myself.  Exactly.  I don't punish myself, but...  I agree with Iraq on this one.  But he always has to go that extra little fucking bit.  That's what I mean.  Because that's what life is.  If I'm going to take the time and energy to pour out cereal, get the milk, fucking spoon,  I want it to be like fucking Fruit Loops.  Or Apple Cinnamon Cheerios.  I had one fucking... 
[01:50:30]  The girl down from the mashup had some cereal.  They're called Cinnabon.  Cinnabon cereal?  They taste like little cinnamon buns.  And I had three individual...  They're tiny.  And it could be the best thing I've ever eaten.  I said, I can't touch these anymore.  Yeah, they're good.  That's too sweet.  Troy, are you surprised that Iraq likes to have a sweet treat?  Oh, my...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Troy's in the studio.  Troy, Iraq made it in at 8.15 today.  I know, it's great.  Glad he made it in. 
[01:51:00]  Do you think he was waiting for his wife to get ready on the couch with his feet up eating  a ball of Apple Cinnamon Cheerios?  Oh, he was taking it easy today.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Taking your time?  No.  The winter beer is going to be nice.  You had to push a car into the street.  It wasn't exactly taking it easy, was it?  No.  It's a fucking car.  It's all icy.  You can't get anything back.  Was that the most exercise you've gotten in a long time?  A long time.  Ever.  That was not fun.  No, huh?  Were you a triple A?  Oh, it was triple X.  Yeah, but that was not fun. 
[01:51:30]  Sorry, I stepped on that.  I stepped on that.  Yeah.  Why would you just call it triple A?  Because where it was on my driveway, you can't really get to it, so I had to get it  out into the street.  What's the update on you two?  Are you friends again?  Yeah, we're good.  We've been good for a while, right?  Oh.  Can I tell you what happened?  Yeah.  Of course you can, Sam.  Troy made a New Year's resolution to not publicly complain about Iraq as much.  Oh, wow.  How's that work?  I'm trying.  Yeah.  It's hard, though, right?  It's tough for him.  It's really hard, right? 
[01:52:00]  It is, yeah.  Because he just pushes those buttons.  Iraq, isn't it insulting enough to realize that someone had to make a resolution to not  complain about you?  Yeah, like their resolution is, I won't hate Eric as much.  Yeah, that just seems to be as insulting as insulting him.  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, that's not nice to hear.  No, no, that someone needs to make a resolution.  You understand you push people's buttons, though, right?  Well, I understand everything I do, you're obsessed with and drives you crazy, so.  I don't think I'm obsessed with you.  Oh, no. 
[01:52:30]  I just think I have to work with you.  And there's, I mean, everybody in this room, I don't think anybody would disagree with me  that sometimes you do get an asshole.  You're an asshole.  You're saying it's a little single white female-ish.  Oh, man.  A little bit, right?  I didn't think of that, but yeah, sure, why not?  The New Year's resolution go right out the window.  Yeah.  We're good.  We're good.  You are?  Yeah.  Are there things that you notice that you just don't say?  Well, of course.  I think everybody does.  I think everybody in this room, if you asked everybody, it's like, is there things that  are annoying about Eric that Eric needs to say? 
[01:53:00]  All about me.  I love him.  I mean, I don't spend that much time thinking about him.  I don't either, but you do have to deal with him, and there are things that bother you.  I do, because you made a resolution to not speak more publicly about having issues with  me, so you think about me all the time.  What issues do you have with Troy?  That he thinks about me all the time and complains.  Other than that, I never...  It's kind of sweet.  I wouldn't flatter yourself like that.  Eric has no problem living his life like he does. 
[01:53:30]  Right.  No, he doesn't.  A whole slow and shit.  And that's all.  But when you have to deal with him, you know, it gets, it's like a whole slow and shit.  All he needs is a cool ball of apple cinnamon Cheerios and a tasty Coke float.  We've been trying for years.  I don't have either one of those.  And he's totally cool with it.  We've been trying to shake him for years.  He don't give a shit when you think of him.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  More importantly, let's see our cereal choices today.  Let's line them all up.  What do we got?  Want some of mine?  I got them in the other room. 
[01:54:00]  I want you to find cereal from all over the fucking place.  See what the morning mashup has today?  That apple cinnamon Cheerios is pretty good.  Of course, it's just apple chips.  Why don't you just go apple?  All right.  Yeah.  Why don't you go apple jacks?  I would.  Definitely.  Did you like the apple jacks song?  Apple jacks.  Apple jacks.  No, it's A is for apple.  A is for apple.  J is for jacks.  Real nutritious.  Cinnamon toasty apple jacks.  One minute.  I think we only have a minute.  Nicole's in.  One minute.  How was the Super Bowl?  It was amazing.  God damn it! 
[01:54:30]  We wouldn't know.  I know.  I heard.  And you know what?  Your fans, your listeners really love you because they just did everything in their power to  say mean things to me whenever I posted a picture.  Right.  But they do that to us too.  They were sending us all those pictures because they know it was pissing us off as well.  Well, one guy, when I was hosting something at the NFL Experience, was like, yo, Nicole,  let me get a picture of you.  I'm going to send it to O&A and tell them they're not here.  Yeah.  Quickly, who did you meet and who did you interview?  Real fast.  Run down the list.  Oh, dear.  Sofia Vergara, Tracy Morgan, Victor Cruz. 
[01:55:00]  A-listers.  Not one B-lister yet.  Jesus.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Guy Fieri.  Guy Fieri.  Yeah.  Are you attracted to Nicole?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  Who's the black guy you fucked?  Oh, my God.  Good day.  Who's the black guy you fucked?  When did she fuck a black guy?  Back when she, about six years ago.  That's fine.  Seven.  What?  She talked about it on the after show.  She talked about it on the after show.  I wouldn't mind that.  What?  If I were her husband, all I would do is make her tell me that while I bang her.  Her husband texted something very horrible. 
[01:55:30]  What did he say?  You fucked a coon?  Yeah, he used the coon word.  And then he said, I'm packing.  Yeah, he said he's packing.  So was that guy, I bet.  She said he had an intimidatingly big one.  The black guy?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I would fucking, I bet you she told Stanley that story and he hasn't forgotten it yet.  He just keeps following her around.  He's hoping she cracks again.  You rock his snack.  He got his checks while he's waiting for you to get to the shipping.  Oh, look at that.  What kind of checks you got?  Cinnamon?  I don't. 
[01:56:00]  Honey nut.  I'm not a honey.  Honey nut Cheerios, I guess I do eat, though.  It's got to be something besides just fucking straw.  Honey nut is the best.  I don't want, I don't want.  Let me try some honey nut Cheerios.  I need a tasty, sweet cereal.  Well, honey nut's all right.  And what do you got?  Honey nut Cheerios, too?  I want the milk to look like a Peter Max painting when I'm done.  Get the cereal milk.  See, it's groovy.  Peter Max.  Those 60s groovy, colorful paintings.  You don't eat cereal, Troy?  Oh, no, thanks.  Maybe I went a little far back.  Not bad.  I like rice checks.  Really? 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, I really do.  Just plain?  Huh?  Just plain rice checks?  Yeah, maybe a little sugar on top.  Like it captures the milk right there inside?  That's all right.  No, thank you, Eric.  I'm trying to take care of myself.  I like paychecks.  Oh, Ant.  You've got a million off of them.  I know.  Literally.  Not on this subject, though.  He didn't even have one, actually.  All right, you're out.  I want to hear what they've prepared for us.  I did.  What?  The intro. 
[01:57:00]  Oh!  I knew there was something we were going to do here.  Troy, I heard you got a new intro for the show.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Yeah, well, I was going to try to play it for you guys during the break, but I guess you  guys don't want to do that.  No, let's do it live.  Fuck that shit.  Let's go live.  Sam says, you guys have been at this for a year.  Well, you've been harvesting clips for a year for this?  Yeah, you could say that.  We've had the opportunity to record with somebody last year, and then it wasn't so recently  until we...  There are actually no clips of you guys in the new intro.  Oh, nice.  That's great.  It's part of the intro.  What do you mean it's part? 
[01:57:30]  Where's the whole intro?  Well, like I said, I was just waiting to see if you guys wanted this as your intro.  So I just had a part of it prepared.  Because I was going to do it during the break, but...  I didn't realize...  Should we wait, or is this good enough?  It's really good.  Let's hear it.  So play this?  Yeah, and I think you guys will love this personally.  Stink.  Stink.  Yeah.  Check.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  With Opie Anthony.  Yeah.  Jimmy Tranny pointing. 
[01:58:00]  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working the other hand.  Turn my headphones up.  There are horrible people to say in this old.  Objectible human beings.  And I want you to look unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King.  Opie and Anthony show.  Go.  Go.  I know you're building the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking.  Jimmy's trying to get blown.  Then we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Bored you'll never be. 
[01:58:30]  And don't worry about getting a shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah.  On the edge of you.  Yeah.  Because you really want to hear.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now Mike Tyson up in this bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Booga, booga.  Booga, booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road. 
[01:59:00]  Holy fuck.  That's great.  Damn.  That star studded right there.  Larry King, 50 Cent, and Mike Tyson.  Damn.  Doing the intro to the show.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Wrapping the intro to the show.  No kidding.  Yeah.  And he did ooga, booga, booga, booga.  Yeah.  That was pretty good right there.  That rocks.  That's some fucking.  Excellent.  And it goes longer than that?  No, no.  Because I was thinking about doing the 2001 Space Odyssey.  Right.  And then throw some clips of the show in there for the intro, and then it would go into that.  Oh, man.  Holy fuck.  That definitely star studded. 
[01:59:30]  Great job.  I like it.  I'm glad you guys like it.  No, it's great.  You ought to get some metal in there, too.  We're good with the music chip.  We handled the music part.  Because that gives us some cred.  Sure does.  There's Fiddy in there?  Yeah.  Larry King.  Tyson.  Larry King.  He's known for his rapping.  An old school broadcaster, too.  He didn't do bad, though, rapping.  He didn't do bad at all.  Larry killed it.  Larry was a professional.  For an old white dude.  He literally got in there and was just like, give me the lyrics, give me the beat, and he  just went for it.  Yeah.  It was like one take with him, and he had the rhythm and everything. 
[02:00:00]  He was very impressive in there.  Oh, nice.  That was his shit.  Thank you, Troy.  That's great.  50 Cent, what a trooper he was to do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was a little hesitant.  But then, once he got into it, he got into it.  Why was he hesitant?  Oh, because of the lyrics?  Because he just doesn't like rapping other people's lyrics.  Of course.  Why would you?  Yes.  But once he kind of got it and understood it was a goof on the show and stuff like that,  it was...  He knew it wasn't for real.  It's just silly.  Okay.  Yeah, he didn't object when he was rapping the lyrics, Ant wants to join the Klan.  He probably thought, he probably thought, like, I'm such a liberal that that's such 
[02:00:30]  a weird, ironic thing, not ironic, but thing to say about me.  It couldn't be less true.  Yeah.  He wasn't thinking literally.  It's like calling the fat guy Tiny.  Right.  Something like that.  Tiny!  It's like, oh, he wants to join the Klan.  It's like, Anthony, the guy that gives, like, so much money to black causes?  Right.  Yeah.  That's probably what he thought.  But the truth is, you want to join the Ku Klux Klan.  No, he probably was going...  Want to?  He probably said, who's Anthony? 
[02:01:00]  You know, that's...  Yeah, let's be honest here.  Hey, we have the news story.  I want to hear the news people talk about this lady from the gym that is suing the trainers.  Do we have the actual story?  What happened?  That there's lawsuits for everything.  Oh, yeah.  Well, the Texas woman is suing a gym over sexually suggestive exercises.  What?  Yeah.  By the way, dude, the one that we love, or that I love in our gym, you know, she was...  I was doing my ab thing yesterday, and she was on the mat across. 
[02:01:30]  Her fucking ass...  It's like...  My perspective on life is different.  Wow.  Really?  It's...  It's perfect.  Really?  She's so twatty, though.  You know what?  That's the dilemma, man.  I've talked...  She won't say hi first ever.  I know who he's talking about, and she's so fucking twatty, though.  She never says hi first.  Doesn't that cancel that shit out sometimes?  No, because I have talked to her, and she was pleasant when I talked to her.  Here's what...  And she never looks and says hi.  Here's what it is. 
[02:02:00]  She has by far the best body in there, or in the top two.  Is she the small one?  There's a couple.  There's two of them.  I know which one you mean there, too.  But the one we're talking about, the same one.  Every guy in there wants to fuck her.  So you probably learn just to zone out.  Otherwise, you'd be fucking having dumb guys flirt with you all day when you're trying to do business.  I gotta stop you.  Not every guy in that place, because you got the creep in our locker room that hangs out.  Naked guy?  Oh, fuck it.  Oh, I see him all the time.  The judge?  The judge? 
[02:02:30]  You're calling him the judge now?  Yeah, he looks like a judge.  Or the fucking black guy finally says hi to me in the locker room, because I threw him 50 for Christmas.  He can't say hi to me fast enough.  Oh, really?  I made a friend.  I saw the whole setup with, we'll call him the judge and the black guy.  The black guy loves talking basketball, and the judge loves getting naked.  They got a perfect relationship.  Because no one else will listen to this guy talk basketball at length like this guy wants to talk about it.  But the judge is like, look, I'll listen to you, but you're going to have to look at my horrendous old man body naked. 
[02:03:00]  But the guy fumbles with his own zipper while they talk.  Really?  I swear to God.  What, the black guy?  Yeah, his zipper's always exposed.  You know how your pants have a little flap that covers your zipper?  Oh, my God.  His zipper's always showing.  It's so weird.  That is just something going on there.  And then the other guy that scrolls through the phone.  I hate him.  That was last week, I think.  I got changed, and I was walking by Jimmy's area, and the guy is hanging out in Jimmy's little cubicle area.  Not a cubicle.  What would you call it?  Like a row?  A little bank of lockers.  A little bank. 
[02:03:30]  Like a court.  Is he naked?  No, he's the guy that wears a horrendous wife beater.  And he's a hoarder.  His fucking locker's a disaster.  It's fucking horrendous.  Usually he's in the common area, like sort of, you know, there's TVs and whatnot.  He usually sits in one of the chairs that is around to do his dirty work, which is scrolling and catching cock.  But this time, as I'm walking by, the scrolling and catching cock usually does in the common area.  But as I'm walking by to see, you know, where Jimmy's at, because I figure if he's close, I'll walk out to the gym with him. 
[02:04:00]  And I just looked at Jimmy, and there he is just sitting there making believe he needs to be in that area, because Jimmy is, you know, changing.  And Jimmy gives me this look of disgust.  He never gets to see me, though.  I fucking time it.  As soon as he turns around, that's when my fucking delicious cock and balls pop out.  I never give that fucking, I never give Alan Arkin a peek at my fucking.  He's already changed for the gym, but I've never seen him in the actual gym area.  He's always changed for the gym, but never goes to the actual gym. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, you know what he does?  He goes into the area, he lollygags on the fucking treadmill, or he lollygags on the fucking bicycle.  So what is he just there to fucking.  He's just there to fake scroll so he can look at delicious cock.  And he lazily pedals.  He was on the bike yesterday, lollygagging and pedaling lazily.  But I just love the fact that he was a mere couple feet away from Jimmy, hoping to get a close-up.  But that girl's ass, dude, I saw it yesterday.  And I know the one you mean. 
[02:05:00]  I don't see her as much.  But the one I mean, it's like Roger.  She's blonde, right?  It's like Roger Rabbit's out.  It's fucking.  There's two or three blondes.  They're all twatty.  They're all trainers there.  I just think it's because every fucking guy tries to fuck them.  And it's like, I mean, as a hot chick, you get used to that.  Do you?  I'm sure, yeah.  But it's like when you're in the gym and it's like after a while, because you're surrounded by people all the time, it's probably annoying.  Every guy going, hey, what are you doing later?  So they just.  But I talked to her before New Year's Eve online for food.  And she still never says hello first. 
[02:05:30]  But she was pleasant.  You know, she was fine.  She was like a little flighty.  But she wasn't content.  Well, the juice girl wants Jimmy.  So now she treats me properly.  Yeah.  She hated my guts for whatever reason.  It's weird how these relate these things like you feel it from these people, right?  Sometimes.  And then she saw me with Jimmy.  And all of a sudden, she fucking treats me like a rock star.  She calls me honey now and stuff.  Well, I haven't.  She like I know why she hated me because she hates making the juice drinks because you got to get all the fucking vegetables.  You got to make the juice drink.  Then you got to clean out that shit. 
[02:06:00]  It obviously is a pain in the ass.  So it got to the point where she would slam down the metal bowl as she's throwing the fruit in.  She's basically trying to tell me, please don't order juice for me.  Right, right.  But I ignore that because I want my juice.  Of course.  And she's in the service industry.  What am I going to do?  And then finally, she saw me with Jimmy.  And her whole attitude changed.  She's like, now she looks at me and goes, the regular, sweetie?  Because she knows exactly what kind of vegetable drink.  She likes Jimmy?  Completely changed her tune, not because she wants me or any of that shit, because she wants me. 
[02:06:30]  Would you fuck her, Jim?  No, I don't know.  I mean, the way it happened was I went over there and I expect, because Ope told me she hates making juice.  So I'm like, okay, I'm only going to ask her to make juice out.  Of course.  I'm like, we're going to have an issue.  Right.  But then she couldn't have been nicer.  And we all have membership numbers and she memorized mine.  Oh.  So she just does it from memory.  Wow.  And then I'm like, wow, she's really nice to me.  Ah.  So I don't know if she wants to or not.  But when I wasn't there for a while, she's like, where you been?  You're waving hiding.  Yeah.  And she's telling me she's going to get me to run on the track. 
[02:07:00]  And she's like, a lot of times I'll go in and get water.  Yeah.  And she'll go, okay, I'll get you later.  Like, my first, I usually have to just pay at the end.  How does she look?  She's not bad.  Her face is okay.  She's great.  Give her about a six and a half.  Yeah.  Not bad.  I don't know.  Nice little body.  But Jimmy used to rub it in, like, because I go, that's the one that hates me.  And then he would get the whole thing going with her and then give me the look like.  And I'm like, fuck you.  Yeah, she loved me.  Why won't you try to get in there?  I'm not attracted to her enough.  And the gym, there's a couple there. 
[02:07:30]  That one, I'm telling you, I want to make that one with my girlfriend.  So I'm going to take a class with her.  I emailed her.  That's not how you make her your girlfriend.  He's like junior high Jimmy.  I love it.  No, but she's a trainer.  So the way to talk to her is to get her to train you.  And she's actually, I emailed with her about it because I wanted to know if she did yoga.  Because yoga I could do.  But I'm afraid, like, I'm so tired all the time, a cardio thing won't.  But she's fucking, I've watched her train people.  She's unbelievable. 
[02:08:00]  She an animal?  Yeah.  And they're always doing something weird and different than everybody else is doing.  Right.  Yeah.  So I would definitely, I wanted to, but I'm afraid I'd be too tired, like, to keep up.  So I'll have to just tell, like, we've got to go slow.  And I want to tone.  Mm-hmm.  That's it.  And that's your pickup line?  Nah, I don't see it going anywhere.  Let's go slow.  But a lot of times, stuff like that, like when I rap with somebody like that or talk to them,  for lack of a better 1970s expression, it takes away my desire because, like, I see a flaw in them. 
[02:08:30]  And then I'm like, okay, good, fuck.  Right, right.  Oh, boy.  I just laugh at the guys in the locker room.  Scrolling guy just makes me laugh my balls off.  I didn't even notice.  Jimmy was the one who pointed him out.  And now, since he's pointing him out, it's just hilarious because you know exactly what he's up to.  Man, I pick up on that energy immediately.  Oh, my God.  Guy is in my cock.  And the old judge with the black guy.  That is hilarious, too.  It's like clockwork.  He can't get naked fast enough, and the other guy can't wait to talk about the NBA.  It's so creepy. 
[02:09:00]  That's a very odd thing, man.  Yeah.  I think the old guy's obviously a nudist or something.  A cuck?  I don't know what he is.  Like an exhibitionist or a fucking...  I don't know.  And then there's the guy next to me in my locker room.  Another guy, he wears, like, a fucking Elmer Fudd hat all the time.  And he fucking babbles.  He's really nice.  So I don't hate him.  Right.  But he'll walk in.  I heard him the other day.  He goes, I'm in my locker room.  He goes, ah, this looks like the weather's about to get bad.  And I pretend that I didn't hear it. 
[02:09:30]  So a minute later, I turn around, he goes, looks like the weather's about to get bad.  I'm like, all right, you rehearsing cunt.  I heard you.  I fucking heard you the first time.  Is that some kind of pickup line, you think?  No.  There's no weird sexual vibe from him.  He's just a babbler.  Because I tweet about a guy in the locker room that was talking about cufflinks.  And then some guy goes, he was trying to pick you up.  I'm like, no, I don't think so.  He was just fucking talking about his dopey cufflinks.  That might be a fucking signal word.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know.  He was completely dressed.  And all of a sudden, he looks at me like, ah, God, I don't have any cufflinks. 
[02:10:00]  Now I'm going to have to go to Century 21 and get cufflinks.  I'm looking at him like, I can't relate to you.  I'm sorry.  That's like a gay catchphrase, cufflinks.  Yeah.  Meet me in the bathroom at Century 21.  That means, come get your ass eaten.  Yeah, I need cufflinks probably means you want your ass eaten.  And if you go, oh, yeah, that store is good, that's probably the gay way of going, like,  I'll be in the locker room in five minutes with my cheeks spread.  Right.  So now you owe that guy an ass.  You owe him a cufflink.  Anyway, this woman at the gym, so she gets a trainer that gives her exercises that are sexually suggestive. 
[02:10:30]  You got the actual news story?  Yeah.  All right, I think that'll be way better.  Oh, yeah.  Let's hit it.  Going in to get fit, leaving, feeling harassed.  A woman has filed a suit against L.A. Fitness for exercises she says her trainer made her  do.  Exercises, she feels, were sexually suggestive.  CBS 11's Carol Kovacis is at the Plano L.A. Fitness, where this is said to have happened.  Carol.  Karen, you would think the suit filed would be for sexual harassment, but the attorney 
[02:11:00]  said no, that would be for the workplace.  Instead, he filed a suit for deceptive trade practices, saying, as a consumer, she signed  a contract.  They didn't live up to their end of the bargain, providing a safe workout place.  All right, pause.  He's like a fucking three.  The judge should throw this case out.  Go to Curves, you fucking fatty.  That ain't happening.  Stop it.  Trainers aren't going to risk their fucking livelihood over a pig. 
[02:11:30]  All the hotties they see in there that are actually in shape.  Get the fuck out of here.  This piggish fucking broad.  It's amazing how fast we all judged her because she's not attracted.  I'll tell you why.  I'll tell you why, as much as we're having fun with this.  The lawsuit, which we're going to get to here, obviously, there's two trainers that are in  trouble.  She got a new trainer, and the second trainer did the same shit to her.  That's why I don't fucking buy it.  Okay.  She's looking for excuses not to work out. 
[02:12:00]  I can't go to the gym anymore.  They keep sexually harassing me.  She's pulling an E-Rock.  Can't leave.  My car is, yeah.  Speaking of which, it looks like E-Rock in a fucking wig and a flower dress.  Sorry about that, E-Rock.  Sorry, E-Rock.  I thought you were still in route.  I don't like doing this in front of your face anymore.  Sexually suggestive exercise center of LA fitness lawsuit.  Okay.  Because it's going to be too trained.  Get the...  What happened?  She's decided to refresh.  Hang on.  Turn the sound down.  Let's see what Piggy looks like.  Oh, she's... 
[02:12:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  She looks like, um...  I want to hear Piggy.  She's a fuck out of here.  Sexual harassment.  Be for sexual harassment.  Make me do strange exercises from time to time.  Jamie Johnson went to LA fitness to get fit.  She's a beast.  But she says her personal trainer talked to her in a way that was unfit for anyone.  Oh, really?  She says when she asked why he made her do certain exercises.  And he would answer bluntly, so that I can see your chest move while you do it. 
[02:13:00]  And not in a exercising kind of way.  More in a sexual way.  She said nothing.  Just stop going.  Only to return for a new trainer.  But she says the new trainer also made sexually suggestive comments.  Pause.  She just stopped going.  She's such a piece of ass that these trainers can't fucking keep themselves calm.  Oh, fuck yourself.  You know what?  We were in the same area.  I was watching a trainer at our place. 
[02:13:30]  A guy.  A little dumpy guy training an attractive woman.  And I'm watching him.  Take liberties?  Yes.  But not...  Just like my ex used to always talk about how much she fucking hates when men touch you  and they don't have to.  She's like when they walk by and they got to put their hand in the small of your back  to guide themselves by you.  Or the dick.  Yeah.  And her fucking face.  But it's like I understand that.  She's like it's just fucking annoying because guys think you don't know what they're doing. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  So I'm watching this guy train this woman.  So I'm aware of that now.  I think of that.  And the guy just keeps touching her.  And I'm like it's absolutely...  I was getting annoyed watching it.  But she didn't seem to care or notice.  But it was unnecessary.  Like as she's doing the arms over the thing on her back.  He's got his hand like on her stomach like showing her where the...  And it's like...  Oh that's a bunch of shit.  I'm like I know exactly what he's doing.  He just wants to touch her.  Yes.  And as a woman either A she didn't mind or B you get so used to that fucking incidental touching 
[02:14:30]  that if it's not threatening you don't notice it.  This fatty though.  She ain't being touched by anybody.  But I mean I can definitely see a trainer.  I never would have believed that if I didn't see that and go like ugh.  Like I guess trainers can be just...  Maybe that's why half of them do it.  They put their fucking hand on the girl's stomach.  What are you doing?  Yeah you feel that contracting.  But this pig?  Two separate trainers?  No this pig is lying.  Her tits may look pretty good in fucking certain outfits.  I doubt it.  Yeah.  By the way getting more info on what we see in the locker room at our gym. 
[02:15:00]  This guy writes it's called meat gazing.  Yeah.  There's a word for it?  Meat gazing?  Meat gazing.  Hey could we go back to his lawsuit please?  He's teasing.  ...her a vulgar text.  Her five year old son had the phone when that text came in.  That's extremely inappropriate and I just felt embarrassed and...  Wasn't for you.  Pause.  It was for the kid.  Yeah.  God damn it. 
[02:15:30]  What are you doing reading other people's texts?  Mind your business.  I sent the boy a little hello in a picture.  I'm like would you want to kiss the candy machine?  It's not for her.  Yeah.  What are you doing reading our texts?  He's got the right to privacy.  Privacy of course.  I sent him a text message picture. 
[02:16:00]  So a vulgar.  He's rubbing his dick.  I know.  We all know Sam.  We all know.  I don't know why he does it.  Because he has multiple personalities but we don't want to talk about openly.  Yeah.  Rubbing his dick.  Shut up.  I love your business.  You're just jealous.  Nickel flicker.  He doesn't do impressions.  It's part of his thing.  Multiple personalities.  Sent the boy.  I said I'd like to kiss you where the dirty comes out.  LOL.  LOL.  I was laughing out loud. 
[02:16:30]  LOL.  Yes.  Well what's up with this vulgar text?  Wouldn't she have the vulgar text?  Maybe she does.  Or are we just assuming it's vulgar?  She said it's vulgar.  Wouldn't it be funny if it was a really vulgar one?  Like hey you were late today.  I'd like to fuck your pig tits.  Like if it's something so over the top.  So bad.  That even we have to acknowledge she's right?  Oh god. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Hey cunt where are you?  I'd like to stick in your shitter.  LOL.  L-U-L-Z.  A lot of trainers checking in.  They could have been just giving her compliments to motivate her.  There you go.  She should know LA Fitness is only for attractive people.  Maybe they were trying to get her to quit.  Yeah.  What's the vulgar text?  Did she show the news?  She didn't say what the text was.  Let's see.  Let's see the rest.  Anyone could say they got a vulgar text.  Yeah maybe she has it.  Let me go back a little bit just in case.  Yeah. 
[02:17:30]  Okay.  Return for a new trainer.  But she says the new trainer also made sexually suggestive comments.  Even sending her a vulgar text.  Her five year old son had the phone when that text came in.  That's extremely inappropriate and I just felt embarrassed and ashamed and violated.  More of those words that will get you money in a courtroom.  Obviously.  Obviously.  Johnson contacted LA Fitness corporate offices and complained.  They offered her $400. 
[02:18:00]  She contacted Chase Laws.  Of course.  An attorney.  Of course.  And this was probably an effort for them just to try and move this along.  Like any other claim that may perhaps come through their door.  He filed suit saying Jamie Johnson suffered traumatic emotional distress.  Couldn't function through her daily activities.  Oh shut up.  She tried going back to a gym but hasn't been able to.  What a fat fuck.  She wants what she thinks is proper compensation and to send a message.  It's all bullshit.  I'd like to have these guys realize they can't treat people this way. 
[02:18:30]  They can't treat them this way.  Even though I kind of believe what she's saying.  There's some suspicions there but to really pump it up and say you can't go back to a gym.  Oh she is so full of shit.  And cake.  You're full of cookies.  Fucking ham.  She has a body like a ham hock.  She's a big mess.  And saying you know that she can't function. 
[02:19:00]  Can't do that.  Stop it.  There are people that underwent a little more emotional stress than that and fucking are  able to pull it together on a daily basis.  You fatty.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Turn this thing around.  We got a break because we got the great Steven Singer outside the studio.  Oh my god.  What about the one that we advertise with?  Damn it.  We couldn't get him today.  I did.  Yes.  I was all sleepy.  How did you say advertise?  It was like the one that advertised with advertising. 
[02:19:30]  I couldn't even spit it out.  I couldn't fashion the thought.  Yeah well.  The Steven Singer improvs are few and far between.  It'll be 30 seconds before we have a chance to do another one.  You know that shooting in Arizona?  Which one?  Last week.  With the guy.  Chris Kyle?  No it was Texas.  No.  I think it was Arizona.  There was another one.  Some guy walked into an office or something.  I don't remember that.  Oh yeah.  The office.  The guy that died was named Steven Singer. 
[02:20:00]  Oh I did see that.  A little trivia for you.  What about the hostage where the guy had the kid?  What the fuck was that?  Was he sexually abusing the kid or was it irrelevant?  Supposedly not.  He kidnapped the kid off a bus.  Killed the bus driver and brought him into this underground.  For what reason?  Because he's crazy.  That's why.  Crazy old curmudgeon.  They were talking to his neighbors and stuff and they all said the guy was nuts.  He had an underground bunker.  I don't understand how they were able to save the kid and kill him.  Did they?  He had all the advantage in that situation, didn't he?  But were they, let me ask you.  In an underground bunker? 
[02:20:30]  How the fuck do they get?  That's how damn good these guys are, huh?  Yeah.  What do they want the kid for?  No.  No logical reason.  Was he hurting the kid or no?  Supposedly not.  Supposedly the kid's alright.  You know, he was down there for five or how many days?  Like five or six days.  But he had to take medication and they sent down the medication for the kid and he was  giving the kid the medication and shit like that.  And supposedly he didn't fucking, you know, fondle him or anything.  He wasn't fucking him or nothing.  Ah, he need a bunker.  That didn't work out too well for him, Uncle Paul. 
[02:21:00]  But they were able to get a camera down there to see where the fuck the guy was and the  kid was before they made their move.  Yeah.  How did they get the camera down there?  Does anyone know?  Dude, they put them under doors.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Those little teeny...  But it's an underground bunker.  Did they put it in the pipe that the guy had set up so he could hear traffic coming down  his driveway?  A vent.  Did he have a pipe set up?  He had a pipe that went all the way to the beginning of, I guess, his road to his house  or his driveway.  It seems like it was a long driveway so he could hear cars and people approaching. 
[02:21:30]  I bet he was a fucking pedo.  Why else do you need that much notice?  People are coming.  I don't know.  I don't know.  He shot a bus driver and took it, kid?  Come on, man.  That's weird.  Yeah, the whole thing's weird.  But I'm just amazed they were able to...  I said to everyone around me, I'm like, man, this is just not going to be good.  This one's going to end horribly.  Yeah.  But they were able to take him out and save the fucking kid.  That's amazing to me.  Yeah, they opened that fucking thing up, stunned him, and just fucking shot him. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Have you seen any more of those videos of that guy in Atlanta?  There's a whole fucking YouTube thing.  Some of them are pretty basic, but there's some funny shit on there.  He's talking shit to everybody outside the door.  There's one where he's like, you know, oh, yeah, yeah, you're tough.  Yeah, come over here.  Come over here, motherfucker.  Come over here.  And the guy's like, yeah, put your shit down.  He goes, no.  He goes, I don't got to be tough.  I just got to win. 
[02:22:30]  That's all I need.  I don't got to be...  The security guy.  The guy's going, put that shit down.  Put down your thing and your taser and come after me.  He goes, I'm going to put that down, dog.  You come after me.  He goes, this is what I got.  He goes, you want to come?  But he goes, what?  I'm supposed to be a tough guy?  He goes, you can be a tough guy.  I'm going to be the guy that wins.  Can we get a message to the guy?  Yeah.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, he's going to get so killed.  You're pushing it.  Stop.  And then the funny part was the guy, like, he's, like, presenting to the security guard.  Of course.  He's all pissed.  So the security guard pulls the taser out and points it. 
[02:23:00]  Like, this guy ran so fucking fast, everyone outside the place is just laughing their asses off.  But someone's going to do a drive-by or something.  Man, the guy's pushing it.  Or someone's just going to walk up and just knock him out.  He's getting threatened.  Like, they're standing in front saying, I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to shoot you.  And he goes, where's your gun?  He goes, show me your gun.  He goes, you come to tell me you're going to shoot me?  You don't bring your gun?  That's crazy.  Oh, he's taunting the shit out of him.  You think he's at least got a bulletproof vest on?  Oh, he does.  He absolutely does.  Oh, he has the Kevlar, right?  He does have a Kevlar. 
[02:23:30]  He's got that.  Somebody's going to get him, though.  He's constantly fucking with the people outside there, the drug dealers and shit.  Can we get maybe some highlight clips instead of going through all of them?  There really is a lot of videos.  There's a few, though, right?  Maybe find one after the break that works.  That'd be great.  Stevie Singer's coming in and then Joel McHale.  Joel McHale at 9.30.  What is Joel promoting?  Just a soup?  Community.  Is that still happening?  Oh, yeah.  It's back on Thursdays now.  Okay.  Season four starts.  Fuck.  All right.  8 p.m. 
[02:24:00]  I'm a little behind on my TV while watching.  Great.  Good show.  Good for him.  Is Chevy Chase out?  He is, but I think he's in the first part of the season.  And then they had to fucking throw his ass out of there, right?  So will we finally talk about how much of a shithead Chevy Chase is, or do we have to wait another  year?  I love talking to people from community and watching them roll their eyes and say Chevy  Chase is a good guy.  I know.  Wow.  I saw the biography of Chevy Chase on the Biography Channel, and he's just fucking hateable.  He's just a hateable fucking douchebag. 
[02:24:30]  God.  They showed his talk show, his failed talk show, and him still making excuses about what  it was supposed to be.  It was supposed to be more of a variety show, but they made me do a talk show.  I didn't want to do a talk show.  Then don't do the talk show.  I know.  He's such a fucking...  He had a few hits.  Yeah.  He could have waited it out.  Yeah, I'm not a fan.  Fan of his movies, though?  No, I'm not a fan.  I don't blow air across the room with...  It's Black History Month. 
[02:25:00]  Yes, it is.  This is worth replaying.  Sam has put together a very good bit for this year's Black History Month.  It's inventions.  Are you sure these inventions are real?  100%.  Black and black inventions.  Even though I explained it earlier, they're still saying there's no fucking way these  are real inventions.  You guys are making it up.  Well, that's because obviously they're racist.  Yes, a black man invented the curtain rod and the ice cream scoop, and today we find  out he invented the keychain. 
[02:25:30]  Wow, that was something else.  That was nice.  Could have been.  Something else.  That's the thing we played.  That was a real nice setup.  Tyson and Larry King.  That was a beautiful setup, Sam.  Yeah.  I was so amazed by that setup, I fucked it all up.  That's okay.  Don't worry about it.  This year, to honor Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show recognizes some of  the great African-American inventors.  Today we honor F.J.  Lawton, inventor of the keychain.  Yo, what's in your pockets?  What? 
[02:26:00]  Give me that shit that's in your pockets, nigga.  Eh, excuse me?  People get mugged in 1894?  Shut the fuck up.  You don't have money, nigga.  I don't have any.  I hear that shit jingling.  Jingle jangle.  Those are my keys, loose and strewn about in my pockets.  Loose?  You need to get one of these.  Get your shit tight.  That's brilliant.  A ring that keeps all your keys together?  Well, if you ain't got no guap, your wife is coming with me, kid.  Absolutely not.  I...  Nah, it's okay.  I'll go.  What? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, homie.  The keychain.  Another African-American contribution to enrich our lives.  For Black History Month, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Ah, Steven Singer.  Oh, no.  We love him.  Everyone knows Steven Singer's the best place in the country to buy a diamond.  Singer!  But what a lot of people forget is Steven Singer's also the best place to go for Valentine's Day.  You know Steven's always coming up with something new that's going to blow her away. 
[02:27:00]  Cool.  Well, this Valentine's Day, give her something really special.  Something no one else has.  Something that'll make her friends say, wow.  I'm talking Sky Blue Diamonds.  Yes.  Blue Diamonds.  They needed the money.  Sky Blue Diamonds.  Steven's new Sky Blue Diamond Collection.  It's not only unique and beautiful, but it's affordable.  How much do you think Blue Diamonds cost?  I bet they sound expensive, right?  Well, Steven's best-selling Sky Blue Diamond Cynthia Hart is only $299. 
[02:27:30]  You have to check it out.  How?  Well, you don't even have to move.  Go online to IHateStevenSinger.com and view the brand new collection of...  Of what?  Once again...  Of what?  The copy is...  They had...  Now...  It's 9 a.m.  We went through this.  Eastern Standard Time.  Wait, what did we just pitch about this, Sam? 
[02:28:00]  Two hours ago?  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, it was two hours ago.  How long does it take?  Wait, they had two hours to not look like idiots.  The sponsor is here.  He's here.  He's outside the studio.  He's sitting outside our studio.  You guys got time for me to print something?  What?  I literally, and this is not a joke, just right now, got some revised copies.  Why did it take so long?  And why is it in your inbox?  Why isn't it printed out and brought into the studio? 
[02:28:30]  Why would that be fucking emailed to you?  Why is there an extra step?  Hold it, hold it.  That isn't a complete copy.  Nope.  Look, check it out.  You don't even have to move.  Go online to IHateStevenSinger.com and view the brand new collection of, and he just put  Sky Blue Diamonds.  What about the phone number?  There's no other corner, 8th and Walnut.  That is not what we needed. 
[02:29:00]  Other corner, 8th and Walnut.  888-I-HATE-Steven-Singer.  Money back guarantee.  Free shipping.  In time for Valentine's Day.  Steven, I have got to apologize to you.  I just called the lawyer from L.A. Fitness.  I wanted to know if I could start a lawsuit.  I don't think I'm ever going to be able to advertise again.  Emotional distress.  I have emotional distress.  My spots have been cut off.  The wall's still up.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  Yesterday, I had a double read at the same time. 
[02:29:30]  I had a read with no inflection from Sam.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's just the way he does it.  Nobody knows my address.  Nobody knows where I'm located.  I have to sue for emotional distress.  Plus, it's Black History Month.  And I think you're prejudiced against me because I'm black.  I know.  Most people don't know that.  Do you see that?  Now, is that the way that was supposed to end?  Or is that just a sloppy?  Yeah, we decided, you know what?  These guys are so good at selling our product.  Fuck it.  We're going to cut the spot off in the middle.  We're going to get rid of our address, rid of our phone number, rid of everything.  And if they can sell that, they're really good. 
[02:30:00]  Well, two hours ago, we brought it to the dummies' attention that there's an issue.  Two hours later, they finally sent...  Oh, well, it did start yesterday.  Finally sent Sam an email with the advised copy, but the advised copy is still not good enough.  Revised.  Dude, it took them two hours to add three words.  Sky blue diamonds.  There's still no phone number, and there's still no location for your beautiful fucking shop.  Well, we closed our shop, and we shut off our phone, so it's fucking good.  Oh, perfect.  That's the way it should have been, man. 
[02:30:30]  And I guess, what, did you stop doing free shipping?  Yes.  Did you stop your 100% money-back guarantees?  Over.  Done.  Oh, my God.  See, then we're in the wrong.  Yes.  Sam's going to go down the hall once again and talk to these middle management assholes.  I want a name, because right now, the name...  Right now, the name is fucking...  Rob Cross.  Well, we figured it this way.  When they call for the check, you know, can we get paid for these spots?  I'm going to say, we couldn't find the phone number.  We couldn't find the address. 
[02:31:00]  We couldn't ship it.  We couldn't get anything together.  But write the number out wrong.  I'll just stop.  All right.  100 and...  And then stop.  And then stop.  That's it.  Halfway through your signature.  That's it.  Don't put the whole date in.  Right.  And they don't know you as a sponsor, because they said that it would be just as bad if we just  made up the copy ourselves.  Oh, yes.  Like, you would have a problem with that.  You'd have a problem with the address going in and the phone number that we've all said  a million fucking times.  Now it's printed up.  Listen...  But the...  If you're going to put the address and the phone number, I don't even want the spots anymore. 
[02:31:30]  I mean, that's crazy.  What is that, Ant?  The revised spot isn't good enough.  It doesn't have the phone number or the address.  They all end the same way with the other corner of Ethan Walnut and 1-888-I-Hate-Steven-Singer,  I-Hate-Steven-Singer.com.  They all end the same way.  Everyone knows that.  So if that's not ending the spot, then it's a fucking...  It's a shoddily put-together piece.  And my point, which has been made so many times, it's ridiculous.  They don't pay attention, so they don't know this.  So why are they, like, in charge... 
[02:32:00]  Quote in charge.  Why are they babysitting this channel?  I mean, if he wants to get good reads, you've got to go on my show at 10 o'clock to 11 today.  Oh, right.  I am on your show.  I know.  Oh.  You're going on the show?  I was whoring myself.  No, I mean...  We're a sponsor.  Yes.  You're the only sponsor, and they don't take care of you.  We have other sponsors that come and go for the holidays, all that crap, but you're with us all year long.  You know what's funny?  I was talking to Roland.  I got here around 7, 7.30, and we're talking.  Matter of fact, I saw Sam go down the hall to find out where the copy was for the stuff. 
[02:32:30]  But we were talking about it.  I said, you know, in 2000, I think it's 2006, something like that, when we first started with Sirius and all this crap was going on, we said, you know what?  We'd love to give gift bags out.  When you get a big guest in, have a real nice gift bag of all cool products, maybe get some stuff like from Apple or, you know, all the different sponsors that do it.  And we got shot down.  Wait, why?  You came up with the idea?  It was my idea.  That's a nice idea.  And I figured it would entice people to come in. 
[02:33:00]  It would be a nice thing, you know, we could do, you know, from all the different sponsors.  And not just myself, but, you know, all sponsors on the channel.  They said no.  Why'd they say no?  You were thinking of others.  It's because it's too much work.  No one around here wants to work.  I don't know.  Nobody wanted to coordinate it.  I don't know.  They don't have enough advertising, maybe.  It would have just been you and, like, one Vermont teddy bear.  You and stuff that makes your cum taste like fucking watermelon.  Nice.  Yeah, exactly.  Would you like a teddy bear, a gold-dipped rose, or something to take the cum taste out of your mouth? 
[02:33:30]  Sam's back.  Sam?  He did some recon for us.  Yes, Sam?  And?  Now, of course, this is hearsay, but that's what I specialize in.  You're very good at hearsay.  Yes, Sam.  I talk to a lot of people.  How many people?  How many people did I talk to just now?  Yes, about this issue.  I spoke to two people.  However, I did not speak to Rob Cross.  Oh, why?  Why?  Because I got information that I thought I would share with you first.  Oh, okay.  Is Rob in, like, a closet somewhere thinking it's the bathroom? 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  He just can't figure it out?  I don't know where he is right now.  Was he there for another reason?  All right, guys.  My understanding is, the way this process works.  You didn't talk to Chuck Roast.  No, I didn't get a chance.  Chuck Roast.  Talk to Chuck Roast.  The way the process works is, copy comes from Steven Singer and his company.  Sure.  And then it gets vetted through our sales department.  Okay.  It gets sent to a department that's called Traffic. 
[02:34:30]  Now, these are not Traffic Reporters.  Right.  It's just what the department's called.  Traffic copy and pastes the copy into a format for us.  Uh-huh.  That format is then emailed to the representatives for the show.  Uh-huh.  The error happened in the copy-paste traffic step.  Some stupid asshole, not paying attention to their job, copy and fucking just dragged it  without realizing that words were missing. 
[02:35:00]  Now, the story thickens.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Because-  The plot thickens.  The plot thickens.  The story thickens.  It's a thick story.  Oh, okay.  Because it appears that Traffic was informed of this, or Sales was informed of this.  Yesterday or today?  At 8.09 a.m.  Today.  Today.  That means 24 hours after we brought it to their attention.  Now, why weren't they informed yesterday? 
[02:35:30]  Right.  They were informed by Rob Cross this morning.  Why weren't they informed yesterday?  At fucking 7-something.  So I'm still saying it's Rob Cross' fault.  So there's a-  Should I go check Rob Cross?  Yes.  Yes.  Because right now, his name is on this error.  Go right over-  His name.  Go over there and say, look, I want to know-  I'm over here.  No, why did this happen?  No.  You know, it makes me feel so good about me when I come in here and I see how screwed up  everything is.  Exactly.  I feel like my life is just peachy.  Everything is great. 
[02:36:00]  Isn't it?  Last time you were in, you gave us a whole laundry list of problems with this place.  Well-  And you're an outsider.  I have a meeting.  And I'm here to tell you, nothing has changed.  I see the studio behind us is empty.  And I heard that she's going to broadcast from our house after the 19th.  That's my understanding.  Wow.  You know more than we do.  So there's no reason not to have that wall knocked down and taken over.  And I said, listen, I just was curious as a sponsor. 
[02:36:30]  Can I know why that's not, you know, why isn't it?  I was told when you guys came here that you were going to have a nicer, bigger studio with  a place for an audience or a band or somebody.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  Because I said it reflects on me because if they have a band or, like, you know, really  great A-list celebrities, and they've done some unbelievably great interviews with A-list  celebrities, I said, it boosts the listenership, right?  Then it makes my spots more prominent and more important.  Please stop using logic. 
[02:37:00]  And then I'm going to be happy with it right now.  How was the green room?  We made sure we got a green room since the last time you pitched about it, three, four  months ago.  There's a refrigerator that doesn't work with, that's inside the office with a fan with  about three, four inches of dust on it.  There's old pictures and things that are coming off the wall.  And then they have you cloaked so that nobody can kind of see in there.  Yeah.  There's a chair with one armrest.  That's where A-list guests go, by the way.  Do you know how unprofessional that looks?  And you're almost, the way it's situated, you're almost in the hallway. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  You're about seven, eight inches away from the hallway.  And if you have a coat or if there's two people, you're in the hallway because there's  nowhere else to go.  That's where our A-list guests go.  Now, I know you do a lot of local radio down there in Philly, right?  We do.  Do they have better?  Local and national, yes.  But I'm just going with the local because they're below us.  Right.  Because they're just one market guys.  Right.  And I'm not trash.  I'm just saying what it is.  Are you treated better there?  And do you have a green room and all that crap?  There's a green room.  There's usually a little breakfast set out.  There's a place to sit. 
[02:38:00]  They usually have somebody welcome you.  And it's very, very nice.  Then they have it so you could actually hear the show.  Oh.  So that when you get on, you would be in the rhythm.  We don't want that.  You would know what they were talking about and what was going on.  We never want that.  And sometimes they even have it with a monitor so you can see it if it's not a window situation.  Yeah, we don't have visual elements.  And I go to shows that are â€“ I don't want to be demeaning to anyone â€“ that are much further down the ladder of this.  This is in the upper stratosphere, right?  You would think.  This is the top few percent of shows nationally. 
[02:38:30]  You would think.  We don't even believe that.  So when I go to these other shows and they treat you like a king, I'm going to another show after this.  I have an appointment.  And I can tell you that that setup is like a military operation.  Oh, man.  What show?  Elvis Duran.  Oh, right.  Of course.  And he just plays dumb music.  And very nice, but that is run like a military operation.  Look, I would love to continue this, but Rob Cross is here sitting in the studio. 
[02:39:00]  I had the answer for my crime.  Stephen is our only sponsor, and I feel horrible about it.  Your name is on this now.  You are owning this.  I know.  You know, and I mistakenly thought that because Sam pops video up for you guys, he could just pop a copy up and you could read off the screen.  But that would have worked if it was this morning.  Why wasn't this yesterday?  See, we understand that it was remedied.  And by the way, that isn't even remedied.  That's not a good remedy.  That's not my remedy.  Singer's still...  Oh, oh, oh. 
[02:39:30]  Whose remedy is that?  Pass the fuck a little bit.  No, man, you guys had it right.  There's a traffic department that cut and paste it.  But Stephen's running a couple of different spots, so I didn't want to just complete this copy.  It's the slug line.  I know, but there's sometimes different slug lines.  No, no, no, no.  The slug line is basically the basic info, and every Stephen Singer spot ends with that.  It's a phone number, where he's located, and the website.  But do we have, on the very top of the copy, I don't know if they do it, but does it say, is there a message from, does it say you can feel free to say whatever you like?  On the very top of every page, when we send it, for you guys specifically, it says, on the top, there's a yellow thing that's highlighted. 
[02:40:00]  If you look at the original copy, it says, please feel free to say whatever you want or insert whatever you like.  Nothing.  Oh, my goodness.  It's Chuck Roast?  That's pretty good.  That's the old days.  Yeah, that's terrific.  That's old school.  So now, why wasn't this addressed today?  Yes, today.  First read.  Yeah, yeah, because yesterday this came up.  Around 8, yesterday morning. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah, and this seems like an easy solution.  Especially considering Stephen's our only sponsor, you'd think that I could have done that.  But yesterday, I did not do that.  Oh.  That's why I came in to say I'm sorry.  Why didn't you do it yesterday?  You were busy?  Yeah, I was busy.  Doing what?  Just doing some other stuff.  For what?  On-demand stuff.  For what?  For both XMU and this channel.  Oh.  Well, I guess that's a little more important.  No, it's not more important.  Oh, well, listen.  Listen, I'm thrilled with whatever these boys do, whatever spots they read for me, any endorsement they do, I'm thrilled. 
[02:41:00]  They do such a great job.  They so overcompensate for anything else that's going on.  We try.  Anything that any of them say, Sam, Jimmy, Anthony, Opie, Anthony throws in his impressions, the greatest ever.  Let's try.  And it's, so they can do no wrong in my eyes.  See, I...  But just because Stephen is very lenient and loves us doesn't mean that he doesn't deserve professionalism in his reads.  Uh-oh.  Here comes the boss.  Uh-oh.  Here comes Platter.  Uh-oh. 
[02:41:30]  He might come on the air.  Oh, shit.  What's he doing?  Oh, no.  Now, Rob, that's very good of you to jump on that grenade.  Well, he's doing it.  Like you did.  But what kind of repercussions are there for you because of this?  Now, we know, let me just preface this by saying we know when young Samuel, our rotund E-Rock, or our gay Travis do things that, you know, we address on the air, you guys lay into them.  And they absolutely know they fucked up. 
[02:42:00]  What will happen to you?  What repercussions are there for your complete inability to have remedied this problem in a timely fashion?  I don't know.  Unknown at this point.  Unknown.  Do you think Steve Blatter?  There could be a lambasting from Steve.  There could be one from the sales department.  Who knows?  Maybe there's two lambastings.  I don't know.  That doesn't sound like a man afraid of a lamb.  No, it doesn't.  It doesn't really sound like he is afraid that this will affect his career.  I don't think it's necessarily that.  I mean, the ship kind of sailed. 
[02:42:30]  So, you know what it is.  What do you mean the ship kind of sailed?  Yeah, what do you mean?  I mean, like, you know, the mistake was made.  So all I can do is apologize to Steven.  Well, you have to be held accountable.  You're right.  In some way, shape, or form.  I could issue an apology.  Upper management.  But what I would mean, though.  You know what?  But I think an issued formal apology is better than just some...  Yeah, yeah.  Not everything off the cuff.  What was that guy, Mo, the other day that had to do the apology?  I would like a formal apology like that.  Was that terrible?  Well, you said, we want a good five-minute-long fucking monologue. 
[02:43:00]  From Chuck Roast.  I will draft a formal apology.  With sensitive music behind it.  And what do you have to do?  You have to go to a woman's place of work or something like that?  And apologize in person.  And apologize in person.  And place she ate pennies.  Attend meetings.  A whole list of shit, right?  He brought a dip for our paint chips.  Right.  All right, well...  So, anyway...  Tim, I'm sorry.  Well, listen.  As far as I'm concerned, don't give it a second thought.  Yeah?  Don't give it a second thought.  Just do me a favor. 
[02:43:30]  What about a first one?  Would have been nice.  As a sponsor, just take care of my boys here.  You know what?  If they're happy...  We're not.  Right.  Can you talk to them?  I will have such a great success.  It will affect my success exponentially.  Yeah, because we'll just look at...  See, Steven Singer's spot is coming up.  And we'll just go off in a good, fun mood and...  Exactly.  Fantastic.  Exactly.  You got a meeting with Scott Greenstein today?  Next...  After, I think, the 19th...  The day that... 
[02:44:00]  Are we still partying down there?  The day that they're done there, we have a meeting.  I think it's set up for the 19th.  It's after Valentine's Day.  Oh.  Because they have some corporate earnings or something going on today.  Oh.  I wonder what that looks like.  I'll tell you one thing about Sirius.  The Sirius stock was very good.  Was it?  It was $3.20.  Wow.  $3.20.  It was going up.  Fuck yeah.  $3.20.  A lot more.  Malone just bought Virgin Media for $23.3 billion.  What's Virgin Media?  It's media over there. 
[02:44:30]  Some media.  I got to piss.  We're still in a break, by the way.  I guess.  Are we?  But Malone's the guy that now owns this place, and he just turned around and made another  deal for $23.3 billion.  Nice.  Isn't he the largest landowner in the United States?  Is he?  I believe.  The largest real estate owner in the United States.  I like that.  Go get her.  That guy's probably worth $200,000, $300,000.  Oh, perhaps.  That's about right.  Where are we at?  I think we're all good.  So could Rob Cross leave?  Yeah.  Yeah, he left.  Rob.  A formal apology to Steven Singer, I think, is what is needed. 
[02:45:00]  I want something written up.  Nice.  We're going to talk about fantasies.  All right.  I'm going to pay.  Do they have all their copy?  Huh?  Do they have all the copy there?  They got all their copies, Steven Singer.  I'm doing something wrong.  Phone numbers, websites, a good description of the product.

[02:46:30]  Attention anglers, still convinced that fishing is a sport?  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion.  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  It's not a sport.  It's not a sport.  Go in the water with your fists and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger.  This collection is presented on nine full-length high-fidelity audio cassettes 
[02:47:00]  and will thoroughly convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders and a big gut standing there in 10-degree water  strinking Pabst Blue Ribbon trying to hook some asshole fish.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  Despite what you may think, fishing is not a battle of wits.  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish  who has been doing the same thing since dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan.  Do you understand?  That fish was no smarter when a Tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street and Broadway. 
[02:47:30]  Put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of Fishing is Not a Sport, you douche.  Narrated by James Norton.  I'm just letting you know, you're not a sportsman.  Series XM.  Series XM.  The opening of the show.  We try. 
[02:48:00]  Steven Singer in studio.  From the other corner of 8th and Walnut down there in Philly.  In Philadelphia.  He's got to take care of some things for me.  I'll tell you right now.  Oh yeah, I gotta fucking fix some shit.  What's up?  I had to cut rings off my wife.  That's what's up.  I still haven't fixed it.  Oh, that's right.  When she was pregnant.  She liked her stuff so much she refused to take it off her fingers until the last minute. 
[02:48:30]  But she's back in shape.  Back in shape.  Alright.  Rockin' and rollin'.  We'll put them back together for her.  Alright.  I have no one to buy jewelry for.  Yeah, you do.  Who?  I should buy it for that trainer.  Just give her gold dip, bros.  Hi.  Hi there.  Really creep her out.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Did I say it wrong?  Times.  Valentine's.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Is that thing rolling?  He's rolling, baby.  We're going to get some info from fucking Joel McHale today.  Yes, we are.  And 10 o'clock is the Jim Norton show. 
[02:49:00]  Jim Norton, yes.  How are you, sir?  Hi, Joel.  There's Joel McHale.  How you doing, man?  Has been a while.  Look at you.  You look so much more Hollywood every time you come in.  You really do.  Thanks, buddy.  You do, man.  When you were just doing that cute little clip show.  He still does the cute little clip show.  I know.  But when he was just doing that.  That's my favorite thing he does.  I'm anorexic now.  When you get a, yeah.  Manorexic, I like to call it.  Manorexic.  And he recognized my beet juice.  You bet.  Oh, really?  Yes, he did. 
[02:49:30]  He knew I was drinking some beet juice with some other vegetables in there.  Are you juicing?  I don't.  I'm on the slow carb diet.  I am not joking when I'm now being.  Really?  What is a slow carb diet?  Well, this guy should be paying me, by the way.  There's this book called The 4-Hour Body, and it's got all these theories in it, but one  of them is this slow carb thing where it basically is like, during the week, it's basically you're  carb-free other than beans and lentils. 
[02:50:00]  Delightful.  You lose all your weight through gas.  Right.  Oh, shit.  Beans and lentils.  Beans and lentils, but you can have as much meat, fish, and, you know, no fruits.  What about pretzels?  No fruits.  No fruits.  No dairy.  Fruits have carbs in them, but that's it.  Yeah, but fruits are healthy, though.  I mean, fruits are, I think the good outweighs the bad in fruits.  But then there's a cheat day where you can eat like you're 14 years old, and I will have  a 12-pack of Coke.  I will go crazy. 
[02:50:30]  And the theory is, is that you trick your body, like once your body realizes, oh, we  are not getting any sugar, your body goes into a slight starvation mode, and then you  hit it with this huge amount of sugar, and it goes, oh, we're fine, so your metabolism  keeps going fast, and then you hit it back with the...  Is it working?  I lost 20 pounds.  Yeah, but Joe was always thin, though.  I mean, I never thought you needed to lose weight.  It looks all holly.  I am always in a desperate, because when I have to take my shirt off for community, I'm constantly  insanely, so very self-conscious. 
[02:51:00]  That would be a little crazy, right?  Did you punch Chevy Chase in the face?  Not in the face.  You punched him?  I punched him in the hand.  Oh, you did?  What happened was, was we were, we were shooting our first year Christmas episode, and he  was teaching my character how to box, and he was wearing those pads on his hands, and  he, he, we were shooting the scene, and then he would be like, come on, hit me!  And I'm, I'm hitting him, and he's like, you're not really hitting me!  And I was like, you're right, because we are shooting a TV show that we are, this is 
[02:51:30]  pretend.  It's called acting, yes, yes.  I am playing a character named Jeff, and you're playing Pierce.  We are not here for me to hit you.  Oh, man.  And he was like, you pussy, you can't hit me!  And I was like, all right.  So, after we kind of got through most of the scene, I was like, fine, I'll give you a  left.  I will throw a left into your left hand, and, uh, and then I separated his shoulder.  Did you really?  And I swear to you, it wasn't, it wasn't like, I was like, you motherfucker.  I wasn't like, I was like, here I go. 
[02:52:00]  It was more, it was kind of like, I'll just give him a, I'll give him a good pop, and  then he was like, ah!  And then, of course, the crew was like, why did you do that?  I'm like, he was begging me to hit him.  Then they meant, why didn't you go for the joy?  So, now, you are, do you have any boxing, uh, history at all?  No.  No.  No.  I played a lot of football, but there was not as many punches.  He just, you know.  Do you have a boxing history?  I don't know.  My dad, my dad was a boxer, and he, uh, went to the doctor when he was like 65, and the  doctor went, when did you break your nose? 
[02:52:30]  And he goes, I never broke my nose.  And he goes, no, you have a, you have a fracture right here, it healed.  And then he figured out, like, he was a freshman in high school, he had broken his nose and  never knew about it.  He probably had bad breathing for his entire life.  He did.  That was what, one of his nostrils was slightly bigger, because the other one wasn't getting  anything.  Damn.  Yeah.  Did he have bad sleep problems and stuff like that?  Did he snore?  Yeah, he snored a ton.  I love how Jimmy brings up the fact that you separate a 70-year-old man's shoulder,  and he's like, a boxing experience?  Like that? 
[02:53:00]  It's like, my fucking sister could have done that to Chevy.  No, but I was just curious if he did, though, because he was taking it easy.  That's what made me, I'm like, maybe Joel knows he throws a really good punch, and he  doesn't want to hurt Chevy Chase.  Yeah, but I did make it look like it was fucking Foreman you knocked out.  I did, I must have, I wasn't expecting him to, that to happen.  Right, right.  How good did it feel to hear him go like, oh, even though he's old, it's like, yeah.  I first thought he was kidding.  I was like, oh, you asshole, and he was like, no, you really hurt me.  I'm like, oh.  It's like, you asked me to.  And then I look like the dick. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, of course.  He used to do all those pratfalls, damn you.  We all know who the dick is, though.  He suffers from, does he?  He suffers from, well, great pain from those days.  Yeah, from the old pratfalls.  Is that true, you think?  He was peeing blood after he fell down one of them.  Really?  He fell down a set of stairs.  Man.  So, that's a good time.  Yeah, and I guess that got him on some of the painkillers and stuff like that.  Yeah.  You always come in here, we only talk about Chevy.  We're obsessed with someone trashing him.  It's so ridiculous.  It is the, it's the blast radius of him. 
[02:54:00]  Yes.  It consumes a lot of confidence.  Is he finally out of your life?  Is he finally out of your hair?  He's off the show.  I know, I know, I know season four starts and he's in a couple episodes.  He's in all the episodes.  Oh, he is in all of them.  He made it in all of them.  No, and believe me, and I want, the man, I want to shake him and go, I mean, for a long  time, I'm just like, dude, everyone loves you.  Loved.  You are loved.  You won.  You won.  Right, right.  And, but he's just not, he just didn't want to be there.  Uh-huh.  It's amazing.  Why wouldn't you want to be on a TV set doing a gig? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, man.  It's a good gig, too.  What else are you doing?  It's a great gig.  I think he's a very funny comic actor.  I think he's great.  Community's a great show, too, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He would say in articles that he didn't want to be there, he was doing it for the money,  and he didn't like the writing.  What a fucking self-destructive guy.  What do you think his problem is, overall?  Because so many people have stories.  I don't, I think he is just not that happy.  And he's got a really great family.  Yeah, yeah.  I've gotten to know them, and it's just, he's just not that happy. 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  And there's nothing you can do about it.  Do you ever have sex with any of them daughters?  Yeah, just group.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Just making sure.  I heard tell rumors, yeah.  You heard rumors?  I did not.  That's weird, because we broadcast it.  I didn't hear it.  I saw you on Tosh.  Yes.  I was watching the new Tosh.  I was, I didn't even, I didn't, I was, we were preparing the soup when it, so then my  Twitter went nuts.  Because he tweeted it, and then I go, oh, well, when a guy with six million Twitter followers 
[02:55:30]  tweets something.  It really does kind of impact.  It was so cool, though, because I'm watching, I like Tosh's show, and he goes to a clip,  and he comes back, and you know, he does the green screen thing, and then he comes back,  and fucking Joel's standing there.  It freaked me out for a second.  I was like, wait a minute, what am I watching?  Yeah, yeah.  And then it just went to the next, went to the next clip, and then I was back.  Oh, it was a clip.  Well, it was, I just was.  No, it was him.  It was in between, I set, I hit the, I did the joke, and then set up the next. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, so, yeah.  Were you acting like you were, Tosh?  No, I just, it was doing my thing.  He was doing his thing.  That's so cool.  It was on my set, and it was just, yeah.  Oh, wow.  It was the oddest fucking thing.  That's great, though.  It was really cool.  That would get people talking for a loop.  We wanted it to be, yeah, we didn't know, we didn't let anybody know, and we just, it  just happened.  Yeah, right.  We just wanted it to be smart.  Do you like Tosh?  I have never met the man.  Really?  In my life.  That's hilarious.  No one has met him.  It's weird.  Have you met him?  Where the hell is this guy?  Yeah, I met him once.  He interviewed me for Comedy Central in Florida.  I was doing a festival. 
[02:56:30]  I don't think he's been doing that anymore.  No, it seems like he's gone on to bigger and better things.  I had a half-sold room while Cheech and Chong sold out across the street.  He's got fucking six million Twitter followers.  When was it?  Probably five years ago or something.  I was in, I remember my girlfriend and I were fucking arguing at the time, so I'm guessing  2009.  You know, by the arguments.  Through 2013.  No, because I think we were arguing because she worked at a fucking clothing store, and  there was a guy in the dressing room, and she noticed how big his cock was through  his underpants, and she kept going back in and giving him pants, and I'm like, you were 
[02:57:00]  fucking looking.  And then it bothered me, and then she goes, what did you not, like she said to me, did you  not know that you're not an Abercrombie model?  She said that to me.  Holy shit, what a fucker.  You have a good girlfriend.  That's great.  The ex-girlfriend.  But then I wound up, but that was a turning point for me, because then I wound up getting  turned on by the fact that she was staring at this big bulge, and it changed our relationship  for the better.  But that was the weekend I was in Florida.  Wow.  So did you have to, then, every time to get turned on, would she be like, let's go?  All I would do is talk to her about it. 
[02:57:30]  To the beach.  No, I would just make her tell me about it.  Was he a nice guy to you?  I never met him.  No, Tosh.  Oh, he was great.  Yeah, well, he just, he interviewed me for this, he was doing wraparound interviews  for Comedy Central.  Yeah, he was very cool.  We reached out to him.  We just went to our show, or acknowledged that we're asking, so.  Oh, really?  Who are you asking?  Our fans have got a hold of him as well.  He has a lower level of desperation than I do.  Oh, man.  Also, dude, also on at mentions, though, when you got six million, we had Mike Tyson in  here last week, Joel.  You're in good company.  That's pretty good. 
[02:58:00]  All right?  How's his face?  He looks good.  He looks great.  That tattoo on his face.  It really is.  You get used to it.  It's weird.  Because it's a famous tattoo now.  That's why it doesn't matter.  Yeah, you are used to it.  You're just kind of like, no, it's that guy.  If someone you worked with came in with that tattoo, it would be really creepy and awkward.  Forever.  And now it's the famous tattoo.  Yeah, yeah.  Does he still get paid?  I heard he got paid a million.  He was paying a million.  In that documentary, he gets paid a million bucks just to work out in the casino.  Really?  Oh, all year long.  We got the...  Does he really?  That's how he looks. 
[02:58:30]  He looks terrific.  He looks great.  He looks thinner.  And we got the low-key version this time around.  We've talked to him twice.  The first time, he was out of his mind.  It was hilarious.  And the second time, he was chill.  A million years to work out in a casino?  As his gym?  I think it's in the middle of the casino.  And people are doing their slot machines and playing cards.  And he's boxing in the middle of the thing.  Oh, and they give him a million.  I think they give him a million a year to do it.  I wish we knew this so we could ask him.  How often?  I think it's daily.  Just keep down on the flash photography, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:59:00]  Look it up. I might be totally wrong.  But I think that's how it was.  Daily? That would add up quick.  That's a million a shot.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  A million dollars a year.  Oh, okay, okay.  Just to work out in a fucking price stadium?  And those boxers are used to working out in front of people.  They're used to the press being there in public.  They don't give a fuck.  And they want to just work out.  And he has a bird collection.  Yeah, he always liked homie pigeons and stuff.  Yeah.  I just want to acknowledge you were great in Ted.  Thank you, man.  I don't really have a question there.  I just liked you in Ted.  Is that getting you more movies? 
[02:59:30]  Not yet.  But maybe.  Because you were also good in that movie that unfortunately no one saw with Anna Faris.  The numbers.  Yeah, what's your number?  Yeah, that was good times.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good time.  Did I see that?  You should see the deleted scenes of Ted because I'm naked with a female bodybuilder.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't know why I once again passed over for an Oscar.  Damn it.  And now look at Seth.  He's hosting the freaking Oscar.  No kids?  Right.  Seth MacFarlane.  Yep.  Oh, right, right.  And that show was canceled for a while. 
[03:00:00]  That was one of the shows the fans brought back, right?  Yeah.  Talk about a comeback.  An amazing comeback.  He, yeah.  I mean, that guy, yeah.  And I still love Family Guy.  Yeah, and it's still going.  Yeah.  I love it.  And he wrote and directed.  I mean, he was, Ted was entirely him.  Right.  And there was all these, like, people had passed on it and were like, they just don't get it.  Why would anybody want to watch this movie?  Yeah, yeah.  And it obviously worked out.  Very well.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You have another season? 
[03:00:30]  Starting tomorrow night.  Starting tomorrow?  Season four.  I mean, did they pick you up for another?  Not for the fifth season.  They haven't picked up anything yet.  No.  Oh, okay.  We'll know pretty quickly after these next few weeks of ratings.  Yeah, yeah.  Isn't it great living and dying by these fucking ratings?  Yeah, it's the high seas.  You got enough shows for syndication?  Because that's where the money...  No.  Well, excuse me.  We are syndicated.  We're syndicated through Hulu, and now we're syndicated on Comedy Central.  So that's already started.  Okay.  But we will be up to 84. 
[03:01:00]  The magic number is 100.  You need one more season.  You need half a season.  That's the only shit.  If you get within 95 to 100, you're gold.  And without exact numbers, how much more money would that be for you a year?  Oh, my God.  I think I'll make $35 million.  Starting...  But that money, you know, it starts...  Syndication money is a lot.  That's what I hear.  I've already picked out an island.  See?  It's going to be great.  By the way, non-showbiz dummy throws in, syndication money is a lot. 
[03:01:30]  Yes.  That's what I answer.  That's what I add to the discussion.  Unless you're fucking Gilligan.  Oh, my gosh.  I added nothing there.  That...  Really?  I mean, those people...  They got screwed.  So...  Hey, by the way...  Tremendous grasp of the obvious.  Do you think when they were filming things like the Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island and  stuff that they were like, yeah, in fucking 30 years, they're still going to be rolling  this crap, and you're not going to see Dime One...  They got to want to kill themselves.  Yes.  The amount of money that would have made?  Crazy.  Yeah. 
[03:02:00]  It is one of the most rerun shows in history.  Amazing.  What is?  Yeah.  Brady Bunch.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Gilligan's Island.  Who doesn't like to just sit down and have some laughs to Gilligan's Island?  I hate that show.  You know, you look what, like, Seinfeld or Drew Carey or any of those guys, and they were  creators of the show, but people who are, like, on Star Trek Next Generation, which is the  biggest syndication deal of all time.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Biggest...  Huge.  Drama, definitely.  And then, I think Seinfeld now.  Seinfeld or Friends is the biggest comedy.  Seinfeld...  Do they get money, the Star Trek guys? 
[03:02:30]  They do get money.  Oh, so they, by that point...  Because the only honeymoonist person that got money was Joyce Randolph, because her brother  was a lawyer.  Because she was the funniest one on the show.  Absolutely.  She stole it.  Stole the show.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  When did the syndication monies become official?  It's been a while now.  It didn't take...  You mean, when did that really start getting together?  For everybody.  I don't think until the 80s.  Maybe MASH?  Yeah, MASH must have been...  Around MASH?  All the family?  Before that, everyone got screwed.  Everyone got screwed.  Oh, man.  But then not as...  I mean, think about all the musicians in the 50s and 60s. 
[03:03:00]  Like, the guy who wrote...  Remember Earth Angel?  The one that was in...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He sold that song for, like, 300 bucks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Probably feeling all good about it.  B.B. King's, like, famous for bringing a pistol to when he gets paid.  He just sets it down, and he goes, I'm being paid now.  Because they would always do, like, hey, thanks for the concert.  You'd pay him, like, ah, see you later.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you haven't counted the receipts yet, and...  We'll have a printing press for money that they have to get to warm it up. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, it's a good...  I mean, but they...  They did make...  Well, I don't know if they made great money, but...  In conventions and things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it wasn't...  Nothing like dedication money.  It wasn't what they should have made.  They, um...  That's kind of the thing to do, is get a little bit part in a sci-fi show.  Because then you could just ride that convention shit for the rest of your life.  You could ride it forever.  I've seen who goes to some of those cons, and they're...  It's hilarious.  It's like, that was the girl that was, like, the little sister in a Twilight Zone episode. 
[03:04:00]  Right.  And there she is.  Hello, honey.  You might remember...  And she's got a picture of her when she was three.  She's still signing shit, though.  How much could they make, though?  It's like, just standing there.  There's nothing sadder at a convention in an empty booth.  It's like, how much could they make, man?  Cat food and some water.  I wonder how much they make.  It's got...  Some of them are by autograph.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you rockin' Sam.  They go to those things all the time.  I can tell you all about it.  I love those things.  You like Comic-Con in San Diego, right?  They're fucking great.  Because you're a crazy person that loves pictures with anyone that had any celebrity 
[03:04:30]  at any time in history.  It's the craziest fun.  But you can't really walk around it and check it out.  And I'm on the spectrum of that show.  You're very recognizable, though.  But the Big Bang people, they will be killed.  Oh, right, right.  They will be like, we want to sacrifice you.  God, that's amazing.  They...  But, yeah, no, it's...  Have you been there?  I've been to a few of them, yeah, yeah.  They're very entertaining.  I like the sci-fi ones and the horror ones, yeah.  It's funny how they launch some movies thinking this... 
[03:05:00]  Like, the buzz will be...  Like, when Avatar was being launched, people were like, oh, I don't know.  And it was...  But then, like, Jonah Hex gets launched there.  Yeah, yeah.  And everyone's like, this is the...  Like, so much buzz, and then it doesn't do anything.  What's Jonah Hex?  Nothing.  That was Josh Brolin's big...  That was the...  It's a comic book.  And at least at Comic-Con, it was the kind of thing that was promoted.  It got a ton of people at the forums, and...  They just don't know...  They don't know crap over there.  But it didn't work out for Josh Brolin at all. 
[03:05:30]  Did they lose money on it?  Yeah.  Probably.  But Josh Brolin's going to be...  Oh, I think Josh Brolin will continue to work.  He'll be all right, you think?  Yeah, he'll be just fine.  You've got to tell us what season four is going to be all about.  Well...  Community starting up tomorrow, you said, right?  Yeah.  We all...  This is...  Everyone dies.  Everyone dies.  That would be a really funny way to end the series.  Why not?  Great.  The...  We will have a lot of holidays, which is going to...  Our Halloween episode is going to be awesome when it airs on Valentine's Day. 
[03:06:00]  It's going to be very, very confusing.  We have Thanksgiving and Christmas, so it's going to be...  Yeah, you threw in a lot of holiday episodes.  We were supposed to air on October 19th.  Uh-huh.  And then they moved our date four months.  Oh, my gosh.  You're not even kidding.  So you are screwed as far as that goes.  Yeah, so we...  It doesn't make any sense.  That is the oddest thing.  But for community fans, thank God, they...  Yeah, they'll be all right with it.  I always thought it was weird when you're watching a show in syndication, you're watching  a rerun of something, and there's like a Christmas episode, and it's, you know, April. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  You just kind of, uh-oh, I'm out of it.  Oh, they got...  Just took me out of it.  They also got lazy middle management.  Yeah, they don't even realize it.  Or when you watch it, like, Seinfeld would do this, because they play a lot of syndicated  episodes of popular shows back-to-back.  They'll do like an hour, an hour and a half of some things, and they'll play the first  part of a show in the first half hour, and then they'll just willy-nilly throw something  else in the second.  Yeah, they assume, like, bah, you probably saw the second half anyway. 
[03:07:00]  We're just going to mix it up.  They do that with The Simpsons, too.  Yeah, they just don't...  Where they shave off five or ten minutes off of it.  And I was like, this is not how this ended.  Yeah, yeah.  This isn't the ending.  They left out a middle part.  Because they've got to fit more commercials in now.  Yeah.  Simpsons have been around so long that they had more room back then.  That's what that's all about.  When Dick Van Dyke was on, they had 29 and a half minute shows.  It's like...  29 and a half minute shows.  That's amazing, right?  A 30-second commercial.  That's it.  That'd be one 30-second commercial. 
[03:07:30]  What do they do now, though?  What do they do now?  21 and a half minutes.  Oh.  I get a terrible.  21 and a half minutes, that's it.  It goes...  Like, the first act is, like, 11 or 12 minutes long.  It's the long...  You're there, or 14 minutes.  And then the second act is, like, it's, like, eight or seven minutes.  And then the third act is usually nothing.  So it's usually just...  They already got you by that point, so you're going to stay playing under the fucking credits.  Jim, don't bitch about commercials too much.  You've got to get right as a big commercial guy.  Coming up now.  He's a big sponsor of our show. 
[03:08:00]  He loves commercials.  You know what we want to give you?  You guys are going to sell a lot of these...  Tin roses.  Tin roses.  We want to give you our first celebrity gift bag.  Oh, is there a tin rose and gold?  With a 24-carat gold dip rose.  Those are 24-carat gold, my friend.  Speaking of Valentine's Day and shows being out of order.  Ah, there are wonderful, numerous Thai restaurants these are featured in.  Oh, yes.  Where do you think we get them?  Give them to your friends.  Don't put them in your suitcase.  Oh, my God.  Tin roses. 
[03:08:30]  Tin roses.  Unfortunately, take that, singer.  That's what they're going to be called in every read now.  And his damn tin roses.  You've got a celebrity endorsement, though.  You've got to choose a copy.  They come in pink, red, and tin.  Tin-colored rose.  Tin roses.  If you would like to injure your girlfriend, you can slash her face, her neck, or her chest  with tin roses.  There is a cutting implement there, a stabbing part. 
[03:09:00]  Look, I would like to show the usefulness of tin roses.  Put the mic down there.  Oh, my God.  He's cutting through the box with it.  Cutting through the box.  Wow.  Through the genuine gold box.  It's tin rose.  Yes.  And it's working.  He is.  He cut through a box.  Oh, my God.  You could do some damage.  You could split your wrist with it.  That's how much gold is on those.  I remember one time I was...  Oh, there goes a leaf.  He just pulled the leaf off.  They don't necessarily...  You can't break the sponsor.  Oh, my God.  He is cutting right through it. 
[03:09:30]  He's slicing through a box with a rose leaf.  One time I was stranded in the woods.  It's like a box cutter.  I ran after a deer for two hours.  I jumped out of a tree and used my tin rose leaf to slash...  You disembowel him.  Yes.  That fucking thing is sharp.  This thing works, guys.  That is.  Look at it.  He's literally cutting the box in half.  Wow.  If you're ever stuck out in the wilderness, grab a rose, a leaf, find some tin, melt it,  or you need a smelting plant there.  There. 
[03:10:00]  Look.  There it is.  He cut.  He did it.  If you'd like to...  Look at that.  You can get your tin rose out of...  If you cut the box out.  I'm cutting the box with the tin rose.  Ah, yes.  I think this company will...  If you want to kill your fiancÃ©.  Yes.  Where are these made?  I remember tin rose.  Are these made in Switzerland?  Or are they made in Italy?  Which one?  These are made in the United States of America.  The very fine...  How do you spell United?  C-H-I-N-A. 
[03:10:30]  C-H-I-N-A.  I literally cut myself with the tin rose.  Did you?  Yeah.  Oh.  You better get to a doctor.  Ah.  The smell of tin.  The smell of tin.  Processed metals.  My wife will love this.  Yes.  What a great commercial.  Nothing else says I love you like slitting somebody's wrist with a ring.  If you sharpen the stem, it's also a stabbing tool.  That is a dagger.  I'll go right through the ribs.  Is this really one of your sponsors?  He's right there. 
[03:11:00]  Believe it or not.  You're doing it right in front of him.  What's happened to you guys?  I'm the best they could get.  I know.  I'm kidding.  He's our best sponsor.  He's our only sponsor.  I really want to say, buy tin roses.  There you go.  Thank you.  Joel, it is Valentine's Day coming up.  And that hints the roses to show your love for your woman.  That's how I would present it.  There's a real rose in there before he broke it.  Yes.  It's like you're knighting her.  This thing.  He broke it.  Joel's just destroying the roses.  I know.  The little rose. 
[03:11:30]  That's okay.  He's doing the quality test right now.  We get to see what they're made of.  You can see that they're real rose.  There's wood and styrofoam in the middle, as you can see.  There is real wood.  Gold.  There's evidence of wood.  You put real.  You have a.  Where do you get the gold?  They're real roses.  This is a real rose?  Dipped in real 24-karat gold, yes.  This was a real rose.  In there, there's petals, and you peel that apart, and there's a stem and leaves.  This will take forever for my wife to get through this.  Wait.  This was a real rose?  Yes.  It was.  It's been petrified. 
[03:12:00]  It looks like a shoe heel.  Well, sometimes a shoe heel and an aluminum chair gets inside the mold.  Are you sure you didn't just get a box of plastic and write rose on it?  I've been found out.  How long does the process take?  It takes several weeks, actually.  Really?  Really.  They've got to dry them.  You've got to call the guy in China.  We've got to get all the tinfoil together.  It's going to be shipped over.  Giant shipping container.  I feel terrible.  No.  No, don't feel bad.  For those of you out there that are listening, I was screwing around with it. 
[03:12:30]  It actually is very nice looking.  No.  It's real rose.  Praise the big crate with the gold rose on top of a rubber dog shit.  Have Joel shocked as he walks out of the building.  Next to a lead-painted children toy.  This is great.  The singer loves it, Joel.  Don't even worry about it.  This is great.  He absolutely loves the fact that he just made it.  Don't let the asbestos out of the rose.  The asbestos, that's what keeps you fresh.  If you breathe in the asbestos, it will stay with you forever when you breathe in the asbestos from the tin rose. 
[03:13:00]  Joel, I've got to ask you about, of course, the soup, or soup, or whatever the hell they're calling it these days.  Oh, Jesus.  Some of the opinion on some of the recent videos, have you seen that gentleman that cracked that guy in the head with the hatchet?  That will be in the show tonight.  That will be in the show tonight.  It's one of the best videos ever.  He was looking for a gold rose to crack his head over.  Yeah, he had to use the hatchet.  That guy rules.  So lame.  We'll have taken one swipe with the gold rose. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah.  Could have slid his wrist or hit him over the head.  What do you think of that guy?  It seems like it's out of a stoner movie.  It seems like it's out of Biodome.  Or Undercover Brother or something.  Where you're like, this is too good to be, this is too real.  Too many good things in there.  It's a crazy guy, the car, hitting someone, people coming to the rescue, and then a guy grabbing a girl, and then the stoner guy hitting him with an axe.  Where do you get the hatchet? 
[03:14:00]  He was traveling with it because he was homeless.  He probably had that with him all the time to protect himself.  He was a homeless hitchhiker, so you're going to have some kind of weapon.  Well, when I need to eat, I just kill someone.  Yeah, with a hatchet or a tin rose.  It's amazing.  Loved again.  Because I think on the soup, because I know it's in the show, but we checked, I think two days ago, or whenever it went up, it was like 5,000 views.  And now it's...  Now it's millions.  A million.  Now it's up there.  That guy's the best.  That will be an all-time...  That's going to be a biggie.  It hit the news today.  They're that far behind, so now people are really going to start viewing it. 
[03:14:30]  It's got to be, though, weird for the news people, because it's not exactly a kicker story because someone's dead.  Right.  So it's not all fun and games.  So it won't be...  Yeah.  Look at this cat skateboarding.  Right.  Now what about Atlanta security guard?  Have you indulged in him at all?  That tased that woman?  That had all the little kids around and was giving him crap and they got in a little fight?  There's apparently this security guard in Atlanta.  Can you call it up?  Yeah, yeah, right.  And he's running security at this mall and he's got a couple of batons and a taser, but 
[03:15:00]  he wears a GoPro camera on his chest and catches all the action.  So he recorded the crime he was committing.  Well, apparently the cops give him carte blanche in this place because they don't want to deal  with it.  It's some very, very rowdy mall in downtown Atlanta.  He tases the mall.  Yeah.  Check that out.  She deserved it.  She was spitting on him.  She was hitting him.  I really might.  We really might put that in the show.  Oh, you should.  You got to see this guy's hilarious.  It might be as good as Dr. Oz's 12 or 15 foot erection that we're going to show. 
[03:15:30]  What is that about?  As an inflated erection that we're very excited about.  Dr. Oz.  He's coming on the program.  So is Brian Williams.  He is.  Brian Williams and Dr. Oz.  And Brian Williams.  Yeah.  They're walking on.  You get a lot of guys walking on now that normally you would think wouldn't be very happy  with what goes on on the program.  Well, with Brian Williams, we're always complimenting what he says.  Oh, okay.  Did you ever see his comment on the Apple commercial?  No.  It's incredible. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  You'll have to just...  I'm going to have to...  Yeah, I'll punch that one.  We'll check it out there.  What he said.  It's the Zooey Dachanel one who is delightful and cute.  She is.  But he has some pretty incredible jokes in it.  But with Dr. Oz, we call him Old Memet Head.  That's his fucking...  And he's like, hey, that's okay.  I'm the richest man in the world.  You don't give a fuck.  Oprah is on my money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's produced by Oprah.  Have you checked out Jeff Probst's show? 
[03:16:30]  It's canceled.  Oh.  Still on, though.  So they're just running some episodes.  What a showbiz name like that.  I watched a couple of episodes.  I could not turn away.  I...  He's engaging.  He's very...  I like the guy.  Do you like him?  I don't mind him.  Was it a bad show?  It was very awkward.  It was an awkward show.  He seemed out of his element.  And his guests were...  I mean, on our worst day, we've had better guests than he had coming on.  They were just terrible. 
[03:17:00]  I need a lot of money behind him.  Who cares guests?  Yeah, they didn't help him out too well.  I mean, we used to...  I like that.  But he...  But we used to make fun of the Tony Danza show.  One of my favorites.  I love...  And what happens with those syndicated shows is they pick...  They guarantee them a certain amount of time.  Then they cancel it, but they still have to fulfill their order while they...  Because when Danza went down, Rachel Ray was the next one up, and it clearly worked out.  Danza, his...  I loved his monologue.  He had no clue what to do with, like, segues. 
[03:17:30]  That's what we called the Danzitions.  Oh, the Danzitions.  That was it.  Danzitions.  Because he would be like, yeah, well, you know, the horrible accident.  And thoughts and prayers go out to the families and stuff.  Isn't a banjo a great instrument?  And I was in...  It was horrifying watching him.  Because it was so uncomfortable.  Like, something so bad is going to happen, I'm just going to be embarrassed for everyone involved.  But it's Danza.  So there's something so, like, enduring about it. 
[03:18:00]  Where he was just like, hey, Jets won again.  Sad news.  Two little girls will kill you.  Yes!  Danzitions, I forgot that's what he called them, yeah.  We called it, and he had me on the show, and he was very good to me.  Yeah?  Did you see the Spider-Man outfit that he had on for Halloween?  No.  For Halloween?  That was a giant cock.  He had a bulge in his...  It got to the point where the guests were uncomfortable, and he had to tie something around his waist.  They made him cover up.  It was really fun.  It's a pretty good show. 
[03:18:30]  That's pretty good.  A great show.  I miss Tony.  He is missed.  And now Rachel Ray's show just got canceled.  Did it?  Why?  Who's the big up-and-comers?  No, Rachel, excuse me.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  No, no.  Wow.  How long was she on for?  That seems quick.  Yeah, that seems very quick.  They finally brought her back after all these years, and she fell.  Because there's no value in it anymore, because it's not surprising anymore.  I mean, there's nothing she can cover anymore that's not being covered already, or hasn't  been covered 500 times.  If she had stuck with, it was one of those, she left a working gig. 
[03:19:00]  I mean, it was going well.  And if you were to, I feel like if you stick with one of those things, then you get all  those people that started from the beginning.  You can't come back.  You can't recapture that.  You have to Springer and Maury, and there's just no desire for her.  Yeah, Springer and Maury's still going.  Maury's still going strong.  How long was she off?  10 years or more?  Yeah, yeah.  He still goes to, and good.  I don't know how Springer keeps his eyes open during a show.  I'm sorry, he just doesn't ring a bell and just go for it.  He jokes about it on our show. 
[03:19:30]  He jokes about it.  He knows.  He knows.  Mayor of Cincinnati.  He does know.  One, the mayor of Cincinnati.  Yes, becomes the...  He's going to talk about politics, too.  The trashiest talk show guy.  He is not dumb at all.  He's smart.  Never thought that.  And then Maury was like, oh, he's a legitimate guy.  Oh, he was a news guy.  20 years ago, I was like, oh, this is...  And then it just has got...  Here come the primordial dwarfs.  Let's bring them on.  He started taking our people and putting them on his show. 
[03:20:00]  Did he really?  Yeah, stalker Patty.  She's now 60, I think.  How much money do you have?  She went on the show as a 50-year-old virgin.  Yeah, yeah.  As for real?  Oh, yeah.  Did they give you any credit?  Oh, yeah, man.  We were all over the fucking place.  Yeah, that was funny.  It was great.  We were pretty excited about it.  We had this woman saying chicken tetrazzini on our show.  And it became one of our most popular clips of all time.  It's just weird what clicks.  Very strange.  The phobia shows were great with Maury.  Does he still do the phobia shows? 
[03:20:30]  I feel like it's almost all paternity.  No, I know.  He went with the phobia for a while.  That was great.  Scaling shit on those poor people.  Not the father.  And everybody loses their mind.  They must tape, what, 10 of those a day or something?  They have to.  Bang them out.  It would be the easiest thing.  You just do paternity shows.  Crank them out.  Who are the big up-and-comers there?  Some of the shows you're featuring on there.  Are you doing that hillbilly shit that MTV's doing?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we always, like Alaska's Gold Rush has been great for us. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, right, right.  They say glory hole every two seconds.  Yes, the glory hole.  It's so weird.  And I came on the show, and the old guy was so sweet.  He's like, how come you aren't making fun of us?  I'm like, well, you do say glory hole, which is, and then you're like, oh, I'm going to  explain what a glory hole is to this guy.  I got to explain this now.  I hope you get a lot of gold.  And Duck Dynasty has been pretty good to us.  And they came on.  They were very nice.  You do the Housewives.  We always do the Housewives, but those go, because there's so many of those, we try to 
[03:21:30]  wait for a great clip.  But those shows, to me, they get insanely boring.  Yeah.  Because it's all setups, where they're like, Linda says, she wants me to meet her down  at the recording studio.  I can't believe I have to go down there.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,  and then the driving music.  It's terrible.  Linda's like, oh, my gosh, Josh Groban's going to be there.  Josh Groban's a terrible example, because he would never do it.  But then it's to promote the Friends song. 
[03:22:00]  And it's all just all, you know, it's all organized.  It's all, it's all setups, and it's really, it gets really vapid.  Yeah.  There was, remember that guy?  It was for the Beverly Hills one.  So that one husband committed suicide.  Yeah, he killed himself.  And.  Thoughts and prayers.  That would be Taylor's husband.  That, look at you, see?  You might know a little bit.  People, see?  But people will, and they treat it like they're not even people, almost.  They treat them like they're characters. 
[03:22:30]  Uh-huh.  And so I'd be getting asked on Red Carp, he's like, so what do you think?  Is it Taylor?  He's like Taylor's husband.  Yeah.  I was like, maybe they should have invited cameras into their home.  Maybe they shouldn't have done that.  I was like, it's terribly sad, obviously.  He didn't, he sounded like he had some, a lot of problems.  Maybe you stop.  Deal with those problems in private.  That something's gone horribly wrong.  Yeah.  But they're more, but they were like, oh, oh, okay.  Instead of being like, so his character's dead.  What do you think they can replace him?  It's really awful. 
[03:23:00]  What's he moving on to?  Yeah.  I understand.  We got to wrap up.  Is that true, E-Rock?  Jimmy's got his show.  And I got to piss.  Oh.  And E-Rock is telling us.  Well, E-Rock's saying Joel's got to go.  You got to press against him.  Joel's got a lot of press today.  Yes.  Community starts tomorrow, Thursday, 8 o'clock, NBC, Season 4.  Yes.  Please.  Very cool.  Dear God, watch.  8 o'clock.  We need everyone to watch on time for this first one.  Yes.  Joel McHale on Twitter.  And also, you're doing gigs.  Lots of gigs.  Carnegie.  Where are you doing? 
[03:23:30]  Where can one place people can go for your gigs?  What's your site?  Go to JoelMcHale.com.  JoelMcHale.com, because he's got a gig March 9th in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and a gig March  8th in Homestead, Pennsylvania.  So if you're in either one of those towns, go to Joel McHale, the Carnegie Library Music  Hall.  This is in Pittsburgh, the Homestead one.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Pittsburgh, right.  And GRCC Ford Fieldhouse.  It's just too confusing.  The GRCC Ford Fieldhouse.  Ah, rolls right up the tongue.  That's for the, yeah, that's in Grand Rapids, the, I'm making sure I'm not in trouble.  That would be Michigan.  Well, okay. 
[03:24:00]  Well, thank you for having me.  You're very welcome.  Thanks for coming in, Joel.  Always fun.  Sorry about the small, small penis compared to that guy.  Man, the dressing room really got you.  How long did you break up with him?  Man.  What happened?  A year and a half ago.  All right.  We have to read this.  Oh, right.  Anyway, Joel McHale here for Tin Roses.  Can you read our...  Masked Sexual Flavors.  You might not want to read it.  You're too big.  You're too big of a snark.  See, look.  He goes, no, you're right.  Yeah, yeah.  He goes, no, you're right.  Masked.  Tin Rose. 
[03:24:30]  I'm going to take these to my wife.  I love Tin Rose.  Thank you.  Masked Sexual Flavors is the new way for foreplay.  Available in four tantalizing flavors.

[03:25:00]  Community, my friend.  Tomorrow night, NBC, 8 o'clock.  Let's do this.  Absolutely.  Promoting the fifth season someday.  Yes, absolutely.  Get that syndication cash.  Thank you.  Take it easy, man.  Thanks.  Jim Norton is a moderately successful comedian, an average author, and a terrible actor.  And you're a chance to speak directly with him.  Call 866-969-1969.  The phone lines are open.  And the Jim Norton Show starts now. 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  We normally start on time today, but a few minutes late, we had Joel McHale, who is, you know,  he's an A-list guest on the Opie and Anthony Show and Steven Sinker, which, you know, just  wound up chatting a bit longer than normal.  And Joel wound up breaking one of Steven's gold-dipped roses.  But now my advice show is starting.  So if you need advice, feel free to call in and I'll be happy to help you. 
[03:26:00]  No one has called yet because we're on a little bit of a delay.  So I actually have to fill the time.  How bad of a radio guy would I look like if I couldn't fill the time between now and when  the phones ring?  I would really look incompetent.  Like everyone else.  If I just blanked right now and I was like, the roses are gold.  How many are you taking?  I don't know.  I have no one to give them to.  I'm on such a bad run with women.  Like I've met women and I'm not obsessive text guy, but then you text them and they  just don't get back to you.  I'm on a fucking, a treacherous run with women. 
[03:26:30]  Just terrible.  Is it by choice?  Like, no, just being like, I'm nice.  Like I'll, you know, I'll say, Hey, like, you know, a few days later I'll text like,  Hey, we'll grab some food or something.  Nothing.  It's amazing how many women have not gotten back to me and I don't write creepy texts  or it's nothing sexually suggestive.  Just like literally, Hey, how are you?  Nothing.  So fuck them.  Who we got?  The phones are now lit.  Yeah.  We have.  Go to whichever one you should.  The first one here.  Eric in Oklahoma. 
[03:27:00]  Eric.  Hi, Eric.  Hi, Jimmy.  I was just calling to thank you for making my wife a freak.  Okay.  Oh, good.  I made your wife a freak.  How?  Oh, well, last week she was watching Comedy Central and one of your specials came on like  at two o'clock in the morning and it was uncensored.  And I got a call this weekend when I got home on my way to the house that she wanted to lick  my ass off.  Really?  Yes.  And I mean, right out of the blue, I just wanted to thank you for making my wife a little freaky 
[03:27:30]  this weekend.  Well, you're very welcome and my apologies to her.  So I'm happy you got your ass eaten, my friend.  Thank you very much, Jimmy.  Good show.  You're welcome.  Thank you.  And continue to enjoy.  I certainly hope so.  Bye-bye.  I just farted in honor of ass eating.  Who's next?  This is an unusual question.  Jared in Connecticut.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Hello, Jared. 
[03:28:00]  How are you?  Sweet boy.  Thank you.  So my reason for calling, and I've been dying to get through to ask you this question.  So my girlfriend, when we're messing around, she's a 10.  She's unbelievably attractively hot.  Yes.  The issue is when we're messing around, she has toilet paper clumps around her ass and  around her badge.  I don't know if...  Toilet paper clumps?  Yes.  I don't know how to bring this up to her in a way of like, hey, can you maybe... 
[03:28:30]  I don't know what to say.  I don't know what to do.  Well, I've had that happen a lot of times when I'm eating ass or eating pussy.  You see like a little toilet paper clump.  And, you know, you got to pick it off a little bit, but you can just ask her, not in a sexual  moment, but you know, because you don't want to be just like, yeah, I'm going to make  you come.  Oh, hold on.  You know, you don't want to spit out a toilet paper clump or...  The worst is when you're trying to pick it off and you actually have to use the nail  to scrape it off.  Sometimes you can just pick it off and do that little frrrt move with your thumb and 
[03:29:00]  forefinger.  Frrrt.  But there's times when you actually have to scrape it off with your nail a little bit,  and that's really terrible.  So I would just ask her in a non-sexual moment so it's not uncomfortable.  Here's the thing.  She's ridiculously self-conscious.  I think if I bring this up, anything that I was able to accomplish with her would be  a year's step back.  Well, how many pieces of paper do you normally find?  What's weird is when it's on the front.  I mean, on the front is almost every time. 
[03:29:30]  In the back, I don't go back there as much as you probably do, but...  Right, which is every time.  I go back there every time.  Naturally.  Probably once a week.  Well, you might want to ask her in a non-sexual moment because you have two choices now.  Her being self-conscious, she's obviously not that self-conscious because she's leaving  paper in her box and anus.  So her being self-conscious, is that what's more important?  Making her slightly uncomfortable or you having to pick paper off her, which is obviously  grossing you out?  So ask her nicely. 
[03:30:00]  That's all.  Just say, hey, look, because you have a really wet pussy, there's a little bit of paper on  it.  I just wanted to let you know.  That's all.  All right.  Thank you, James.  I appreciate your help.  You're adorable.  Good luck, my friend.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir.  Corey in New York has a question about your show in Syracuse.  Oh, hello, Corey.  Hey, good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Huge fan, man.  Thank you.  Big lucky Louie fan.  Thank you.  And I never see you come local and you're coming to Syracuse.  I looked at Ticketmaster.  Can't find the ticket.  So where would you think I should go?  So I looked at Funnybone, the site, and it doesn't appear as though you can purchase 
[03:30:30]  them there either.  I don't know.  March 21, 22, 23, I'm there.  I'm not sure if they're on sale yet.  They might not be on sale yet.  And that's the week right before.  How far are you from Boston and Syracuse?  I'm in Bigginton, New York.  I'm about 45 minutes from Syracuse, probably about two and a half, three hours from Boston.  I was going to come see you in Buffalo.  That was like a three, four hour drive, you know, with a kid.  It's tough.  But right here, it's close.  It's still opportunity.  Is that too close to Boston for me to be doing back-to-back weeks? 
[03:31:00]  No, not at all.  No?  No.  You're good.  Syracuse and Boston are not that close?  No.  Okay.  I don't want people seeing me.  Oh yeah, it's like, even in the middle, it's 90 minutes each way.  Okay, it's totally different, Marcus.  Eventually, they are going to be on sale at Ticketmaster?  I don't know.  Call the club.  You should actually just call the club.  I think it's the Funny Bones in Syracuse.  I would just say call the club.  Yeah, that's what I was going to do.  Okay, thanks, Jim.  All right, buddy.  Hope you come.  Bye-bye.  You're welcome.  Louie in PA has a question about sleep apnea.  Okay.  Hello, Louie. 
[03:31:30]  How's it going, Jim?  Big sound, brother.  Thank you.  Hey, I recently, I've been testing now for several years for sleep apnea.  How many sleep studies have you gone to?  How many sleep studies?  Four to five.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  My last one, I just had done a week ago.  Out of seven hours, I slept for two minutes and 34 seconds.  It's the worst, dude.  So wait, wait.  So do they have you on a CPAP or an APAP machine?  It was on a CPAP, and I couldn't do it anymore, and now we're going the surgery route and 
[03:32:00]  get a little nervous about it, just wondering if it's worth it.  What they want to do is cut the front of my throat and go in and surgically stitch my hyoid  bone and then screw it to the front of my jaw so my throat can't close during the sleep  and then do the same thing with my tongue.  Wow.  It's to the point now where, like, my oxygen saturation when I sleep goes down below 80% 
[03:32:30]  and they're afraid I'm going to have a stroke in my sleep.  Oh, wow.  I'm only 21 years old, man.  It's getting rough.  Yeah, my oxygen dipped into the 80s during my sleep, too.  That's really bad.  I need to fuck you.  Have you tried an ASV machine or AVS?  I always fuck that up.  Oh, ASV.  They had me on quite a few machines.  I couldn't sleep with any of them on.  And I guess this last sleep study I had, it was like 362 times I obstructed my own airway  and 62 times I stopped breathing for over a minute. 
[03:33:00]  Oh, wow.  Wait, are you heavy?  What's that?  Are you heavy?  Uh, not really.  About 500, 200 pounds.  Have you tried, sorry to interrupt you, but have you tried a mouth guard?  Yeah.  Yeah, I tried mouth guard.  Uh, tried, uh, the noodle strips to open them up.  No, but a mouth guard with, like, not one you buy in the store, but I mean one that you  go to a dentist for. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I had a prescription one they gave me, and it just didn't work.  It's like, uh, my hyoid bone, everything in my throat is just sliding back.  And it can't, nothing else is working at their last resort.  How about the ones that, uh, hold your tongue down?  I didn't try one of those, no.  You should investigate.  Uh, Rogan turned me on to it.  I didn't get one because I have central apnea and obstructive.  So the dentist did not think it would help me because it might stop my, um, obstructive 
[03:34:00]  apneas, but it wouldn't stop my centrals.  So I would suggest trying the, uh, although sometimes I think that my obstructives cause  a lot of the centrals, but whatever, I'm babbling.  I would say, take one more shot and see if you can find a mouth guard that also has something  in it that can hold your tongue down.  You might find success with that.  Okay.  All right.  Try that before surgery.  I would suggest.  Good luck, buddy.  Thank you.  Take care.  It really is torture, not sleeping. 
[03:34:30]  And I apologize.  I talk about it so much, but anyone who doesn't deal with it, you don't understand.  It's fucking horrendous.  And I know I need an ASV machine and I just, I, I, I'm so fucking frustrated with this situation.  It's unbelievable.  So if you're dealing with it, you're not alone.  Who's next?  If you don't have the machine, are you just using the mouthpiece right now?  Yeah, I'm using the mouthpiece and it does help.  I can now, I, I now sleep through the night, even though I'm constantly having a, a pop  me, a hypopneas and apneas, I'm still waking up, I'm sure, but it's not as bad as it was  when I do nothing, but it's not as good as it would be if I had the proper fucking machine 
[03:35:00]  because my central apneas are just, you know, fucking me up.  Who's next?  Uh, this is Tony in Kentucky.  Hi, Tony.  Hey, Jimmy.  Love you.  Thank you, buddy.  Say, uh, for the first time ever, I shaved my ball bag and my bush the other day.  I went completely bald and then this shit is fucking burning.  Do you have any recommendations?  Is there a lotion?  What, what, what do I do?  Well, did you use shaving cream or did you dry shave like Stallone and fucking first blood?  I use my, my, uh, my beard trimmer first and then like right above my pecker, you know, 
[03:35:30]  where my fat is, my bush fat, I use shaving cream, but I'm getting red bumps and it just  fucking burns.  Yeah.  You know, I haven't had that.  I would just put lotion on it.  Um, I never used a trimmer cause I don't have that much hair.  Um, I actually cut with scissors to get it down.  I'm wondering if the beard trimmer, did you put the beard trimmer against your skin too?  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't actually snagged my, my sack a couple of times and I drew blood.  It was not a good experience.  Well, that's probably what the problem is.  I would suggest cut the hair with the scissors so you're not putting anything on your skin 
[03:36:00]  and then try a brand new, like Mach 3 razor.  Use a good one.  Um, and maybe you have to shave in a certain direction.  Like if I shave coming back up towards me, it's more likely to be uncomfortable.  Um, but maybe, or maybe your skin's too sensitive.  It's your first time.  I would give it a couple of times.  Just put some lotion on it.  It's worth it though.  So your balls don't stink.  All right.  All right.  Thank you very much, Jimmy.  All right.  Good luck.  Yep.  Thanks.  Bye.  I don't want to give this guy bad advice.  Have his fucking scrotum hurting.  Nothing worse than a painful scrotum.  Who's next? 
[03:36:30]  Uh, Kurt in Florida.  Hello, Kurt.  Hey, Jim.  What's happening?  Happy birthday.  Thank you, buddy.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Sure.  I've recently been diagnosed, I guess you could say, with the whole sexual addiction thing.  What, what, what was your diagnosis, what official diagnosis did you get?  Like you pulled your dick out in a peep booth from a hole in the wall and you're like, I  think the fucking verdict is in.  Uh, were you there?  Yeah, please.  I've been there.  I was, you know, I'm married.  I've been married for 10 years and, uh, you know, I was doing a lot of phone sex, cyber 
[03:37:00]  sex, porn, all that kind of shit.  But the wife, uh, the wife busted me and we went and saw a counselor and, you know,  I never thought, but, uh, you know, I always thought the whole sex addiction thing was just  a cop out.  Oh, yeah.  And, uh, you know, the, uh, you know, the therapist brought a lot of, a lot of good points  up and things that I just thought about through basically my whole life.  And it's just like, it's really weird.  And, uh, you know, just kind of like, what kind of things did you do to try to, you know,  I know, I know you're not over it, but like, what kind of things have you done to 
[03:37:30]  kind of curb it a little bit?  Well, I still battle it.  Um, you know, there's, there's 12 step programs you can go to.  You can go online and look up a different 12 step programs for sexual addiction.  Fine.  I'm not going to any, and I wouldn't say publicly anyway, but not because I don't want to tell  you, but because most 12 step programs have traditions of anonymity, they request that their  members be anonymous at the level of press radio and film.  So I wouldn't say publicly, but it's not because I don't want to tell you. 
[03:38:00]  Um, it is simply to respect the traditions of these programs.  Um, but you can find them online.  Um, and this, the, the, the reason behind that, like just say it's a drinking program.  And if you're publicly going, Hey, I go to such and such, if you relapse, all of a sudden  it makes that program look bad, like these programs don't want to be associated with  any person.  So that's my reasoning, but online you'll find plenty of, of information and, uh, you  know what you can find like bottom line behavior.  They call it like say, uh, for you, uh, certain things are okay, but jerking off is deadly or, 
[03:38:30]  or, or, you know, or it's obsessive or prostitutes are obsessive.  You could make prostitutes and jerking off bottom line behavior.  You don't do them, uh, fantasy, maybe not so bad for you.  You know, you'll find your own way.  I think, uh, I still struggle with it though.  So I'm certainly in no expert position to give you advice.  Um, but it's good that you feel fresh.  Yeah.  But it's good that you, you, you realize this.  It absolutely is an addiction.  It's not just a bunch of boys being boys. 
[03:39:00]  You have to look at what I'm sorry.  What, what, what is it doing to me?  Like you're risking, you're standing in the community.  It's more than just jerking off.  It's, it's, uh, or watching a little porn.  Are you risking being arrested?  Are you risking your marriage?  Are you risking catching this?  Like you're taking unnaturally unhealthy risks.  Then it's addictive behavior.  It's not healthy.  Absolutely.  And that, you know, that's the thing is I just, I always, I always looked at it as,  you know, like you said, just guys being guys, but you know, the therapist has definitely 
[03:39:30]  made me, uh, look at it in a different, different light for sure.  And, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, I was, I was damn near, uh, you know, lost my  wife, which, you know, and, and tail, I would have lost everything and, you know, it, uh, you  know, it's, it's definitely a pain in the ass, you know, but, uh, it's, it's not, it's  not a, a sham.  I will say that for sure.  I mean, it's, it's, it is the real deal.  Absolutely.  Like if you're a guy, you go to a strip club once in a while, like, yeah, I go to a dude, 
[03:40:00]  I go to a strip club once a month and I spend like 150 bucks.  To me, that's not really a sex addict.  That's more boys being boys.  I went out with my friends or I'm looking at this girl, I can't stop looking at this  girl's ass at work.  But when it comes down to, I go to the strip club and I have to come home and I fucking  just jerk off and I edge and I do it every night and I, you know, it, where it's interfering  with my daily comings and goings or my daily, you know, so to speak, or my daily living  or my peace of mind, then it's a problem.  So good luck, man. 
[03:40:30]  Go online, find a 12-step program, there's plenty of them, and I'm happy that you found  out.  All right, well, I have one more quick question for you.  Sure.  Any chance I could get one of those Steven Singer roses to try to make my wife happy now?  Do we have any off air?  We might.  We'll get you one, buddy.  Give your information to Sal and we will get you a rose.  Yes.  You're the best, Jimmy, and I love you.  Love your comedy, brother.  Thank you very much.  And give Sal your information.  All right, thanks.  Bye-bye, buddy.  Put them on hold.  Yes.  Sal, that's Curt in Florida. 
[03:41:00]  Going back to sleep apnea, Brian in PA has a question about mouthpieces.  Oh, hi, Brian.  What's going on, Jimmy?  Hi.  Question.  I got sleep apnea, but the mask is a real pain in hand.  That sucks.  I've been using it for a couple years, but right now it's just like I can't even use it.  But the mouthpiece, is that for, is that for like if you have an overbite, it like shifts  your jaw or something, something like that?  Well, what this does, this, they make a mold of your teeth in the dentist, and it pushes 
[03:41:30]  your jaw forward so you have an underbite.  So your bottom part of your jaw is sticking out a lot further.  You look ridiculous.  You look like you're talking like that.  It pushes your jaw out from your neck, which opens your throat a little bit, which gives  the air a little bit more room.  Now, you could still have the problem of your tongue falling back into your throat, which  is why I wear a chin strap like a complete dildo, but the chin strap keeps my mouth closed. 
[03:42:00]  So my mouth is still open, like because my lower jaw is pushed forward, I'm still getting  air in my mouth, and my chin is closed so my tongue doesn't fall back.  That helps a lot.  It does not solve my problem.  But again, I have fucking cunty complex apnea, of course.  Of course, jizzbag fucking Norton has to have complex apnea.  But go to a dentist who understands this stuff and see what they can do for you.  It is uncomfortable, but you get used to it.  I got used to it like the first or second night, as opposed to these masks, which fucking 
[03:42:30]  blow.  I might go to Dallas and be specially fitted for a mask once I find the proper machine, because  I know this fucking BiPAP is not working.  I don't care what the tests say.  I don't care what the fucking doctors say.  It's not working.  So try it, Dallas, my friend.  Yeah, because I have an overbite, and I can just feel it.  I can just feel my airwaves closing up on my throat.  Yeah, I think if you push your lower jaw out, it might help you.  One thing I do, I don't sleep on my back.  Oh, me neither.  I can't, dude.  I can't. 
[03:43:00]  I kind of sleep sideways.  Yeah.  Every time I sleep on my back, I just, I find myself waking up in the middle of the night  just choking.  Yeah, on my side, too, but on my back, it's horrible.  I work out like that, because my fucking stupid Down Syndrome tongue just lolls to the  back of my throat.  That sucks, brother.  All right, Jimmy.  Thanks, brother.  Good luck, man.  Later.  Who's next, young era?  That was Rashida Jones, who was just looking in.  Who's Rashida Jones?  Quincy Jones' daughter.  She's on Parks and Recreation.  Oh, okay.  Brian in New Mexico has a dominatrix question. 
[03:43:30]  Okay, Brian.  Hello.  Hey, Jim.  How's it going?  Good, buddy.  I want to see a pro-dom, as they're called online.  Yes.  I've seen some who claim to be, but they didn't really have, like, the chops or the...  Sure.  The...  Not quite arrogant, but, like, the confidence of being a dom.  Yeah, they weren't real doms.  They might have been escorts who just can do a little bit of domination.  Right.  Right, right.  And so, I heard you years ago mention a girl in my part of the country named Karen, Karen 
[03:44:00]  Von...  Oh, Dominic.  Karen Von Croft is a German mistress, and I've never met her.  I've only jerked off to her videos like an animal.  She's...  I want to say she's in Arizona.  She's in...  What's the big city in Arizona?  Not Phoenix?  It's Tucson.  Tucson, yes.  I have...  Watch her stuff on...  What's your fetish?  Why?  What are you looking for?  Peggy.  Huh?  Peggy.  Oh, you want to be fucked with a strap on?  Oh, yeah.  She does that, at least in the videos.  She's really sexy. 
[03:44:30]  She has a big pussy.  Like, I would love to see Karen Von Croft, but she's just too far away, and I haven't  seen a dominatrix in years, so...  You should come do a...  Come do a gig in this part of the country.  I did one, but I just couldn't bring myself to go see her.  I was just like, eh, you know, I like the videos, and, you know...  But I would suggest...  What do you think is a good race?  I mean, like, you know, if she's as renowned, you know, if she's getting an audience as far  as, you know, New York, what do you think she's going to charge?  I don't know.  Just go online and find out.  She's probably on Eros Guide. 
[03:45:00]  I don't know.  I don't even know if she does it professionally anymore, if she's just doing videos.  I really don't know much about her other than the fact that she's hot.  But she's a little older.  She's probably 35.  You know, she's been around for a while.  She really knows what she's doing, though.  Like, she's a great dominatrix.  She's fucking great.  And for a strap-on, there's a lot of girls that can do it.  But try ErosGuide.com, or maybe go to the Erotic Review, and look up reviews of people  you might want to see.  If you're going to go to, like, Backpage or Craig's, you might have more amateurs. 
[03:45:30]  But I think you have a better shot on Eros Guide.  But in that part of the country, I don't know.  I mean, I live in New York, so I know if I ever want to do a dominatrix, there's so many  choices, like here and Philly and the whole Northeast, you know?  Right, right.  Well, I'm going to try to get there this weekend, and I'll email you with how things went.  Yeah, please do, man, because I think she's terrific.  Cool.  All right.  I appreciate it.  All right, buddy.  Take care.  Let's go to Nicole in Michigan.  Hi, Nicole. 
[03:46:00]  Hi.  I work for a sleep center, so I know a little bit about the treatment for sleep apnea.  Okay.  And with the mouthpiece, it only cuts the AHI in half.  The AHI is how many events you have per hour.  Right.  So anyone that has 15 or more, it won't work for them.  Oh.  So that guy, you know, so he knows if he's more severe, he can't do that.  But also with the ASV, you should be able to prove that you can't use the CPAP or BiPAP or 
[03:46:30]  any other treatment and be able to get one.  You know what, though?  I'm having issues with my insurance, of course.  And the doctor is saying in the study it worked.  But I don't know, because I knew, like, maybe it did, but I wake up gasping when I do fall  asleep, and I wake up, like, I feel like I can't get air in the mask.  And I know that means that my central apnea has kicked in, and my fucking mouth is just  hanging there dumbly, like a fucking flesh cave with teeth, and nothing is happening.  So the, like, I've actually stopped breathing in it. 
[03:47:00]  Like, I'll breathe for a minute, and then I'll just stop on purpose when I'm awake, and  it doesn't push air in, like an ASV should, right?  Well, I don't know that much about it.  I just know that it's treated for central, like you say.  But if that's what you need, you can also even look online and just purchase one.  Yeah, they're like $5,000.  They're really expensive.  Are you kidding me?  Holy crap.  No, I would spend $1,000.  I would spend even $2,000.  But the reason I won't spend $5,000 or $6,000 is, A, I'm not 100% sure, and B, you have  to have it titrated. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Well, you could find a doctor that would do that for you.  Can you?  I mean, you need to go, well, you just need to go to a private doctor.  I don't know, do you go to a sleep center that's associated with a hospital?  Not a hospital, no.  This was a sleep center, but, like, the tests are $6,000.  The fucking overnight is $6,000.  You need to come to Michigan.  Yeah, it's terrible.  We charge $1,300 for our studies.  That I would pay.  $6,000 I can't.  Thank you very much for your call on the call.  I appreciate it.  Okay, bye-bye.  Bye.  Apnea is a big one.  So those of you that are sick of hearing it, please accept my apology, but it's a big one for 
[03:48:00]  a lot of people.  Well, we're still with that, because Gabrielle on Long Island has a question about it as  well.  Okay, hello?  Hi, Jim.  How are you?  Hi, Gabrielle.  So, quick question.  I know you're on the topic of apnea, and I know my problem's going to seem miniscule compared  to yours, but basically, no problem sleeping, but like clockwork.  I have been waking up an hour or two hours now before my alarm is going off.  I'm going to bed earlier.  I mean, nothing is really fucking changing, so it's just getting really frustrating. 
[03:48:30]  And considering you're the sleep guru or sleep problem guru, do you have any advice whatsoever?  No, I don't know what that is, because it reminds me of a book by Stephen King called  Insomnia, where he was talking about a guy who's like, what is it, melatonin that we  don't release anymore as we get older?  That's why old people sleep less and have trouble sleeping, because that chemical, and  again, I'm completely going off a Stephen King book.  Like, you know, Dr. Steve would give you a real, you know, tactically, it's your body's  not, and I don't know why you'd be waking up. 
[03:49:00]  Are you sure there's nothing happening?  There's no noise happening that's waking you up?  I mean, it's pretty dead in my house.  I mean, and if my dog was to be the one to wake me up, I would hear her jingling, so it's  definitely not her.  I mean, I don't know.  That's just kind of...  I don't know.  Could you try, like, maybe staying up one night, and then the next night you'll be exhausted  and see if you can sleep later?  But then again, you might wake up early.  I don't know.  But you might want to try that one night on a weekend, because your internal clock, for  some reason, is just fucking douching you two hours early. 
[03:49:30]  You know what I think's fucking me up, too, is I'm a teacher, so I usually am accustomed  to a five-day work week, but now I'm doing a six-day work week, so I guess that's what's  just fucking me up now, but it's so frustrating.  Sure.  I thought of you this morning, bizarrely enough, because you were...  I had a dream about you before I woke up.  Oh, it was an ooh type of dream.  No, what was I doing?  Well, long story short, I had no idea who you were until my boyfriend turned me on to  you, an O&A, and we have all these inside jokes now, Chippa, everything else. 
[03:50:00]  I mean, I'm obsessed.  And I actually met you once before, and I did a little, I guess, turn, and you saw my  backside, and you gave me a little, oh, madam.  So ever since then, I think it was at the Hard Rock when you were in New York City, you're  just...  Now, you've flooded our relationship, and in some weird ways, our sex life.  Oh, good.  So, funny enough, yeah, I had a dream about you, hanging out with him, you came out of 
[03:50:30]  nowhere, and then you somehow convinced me to provide oral services for you.  Wow, that's a great dream.  Why wouldn't I go, ooh, with that dream?  Me and your boyfriend are palling around, and I trick you into blowing me?  That's a great dream.  That's the same dream I had about you.  It wasn't a trick, and he didn't have to do much convincing, so...  Oh, thank you.  Did you have a nice backside?  I complimented your backside.  It must be very nice.  Well, I will say this.  I'm coming to see you with him at the Borgata, so maybe you'll have an opportunity again. 
[03:51:00]  Yes, come up.  Introduce him.  I'll apologize for getting ahead from you in the dream, and I'll look at your hiney, and  I'll give you a good, nice, live old madam.  That sounds great to me.  I'm going to hold you to it.  All right, sweetheart.  Thank you very much, and thank him, too.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right, bye, Gabrielle.  But, you know, the problem with the sleep is it's just, you know, here's the inside  scoop.  I mean, you know, on Steven Singer and Steven Singer Jewelers, because speaking of sleeping,  he was in today, and the man's a bore, so he helps you sleep. 
[03:51:30]  I mean, look, I don't even want to do a live read.  I'm just going to talk about Steven, because the guy's a genius when it comes to helping  you find the right gift.  Dude, I don't know what to get.  You know, like, it was my, it was like Valentine's Day a couple years ago, right?  But, so I went outside, and I picked up a handful of dog duty, and I handed it to my  girl.  I'm like, here!  And she's like, that's not a good gift.  I've messed up on gifts in the past.  So this Valentine's Day, like, if I had a girl, it would be my chance to make it up to  her.  I wish I had a girl, because, I don't know, Steven was talking about this really perfect 
[03:52:00]  gift he's got for Valentine's Day.  And, like, I'm like, dude, I ain't spending more than 70 bucks, fucko.  And he said, well, this one starts at $69.  So he kind of, you know, he undercut me.  He knew what I was doing.  And, uh, according to Steven, it was a real long stem rose.  And I'm like, I want a short rose.  He's like, I only have real long stem roses.  I'm like, all right.  And I'm like, I don't like 12 carat gold.  He said, well, this is dipped in 24 carat pure gold.  He fucking aced me at every, every turn.  And, uh, I'm like, look, I don't want some hunk of shit that's going to die in 70 or 80 years. 
[03:52:30]  And he said, my friend, these last forever.  He said, you're going to get credit for this gift for a lifetime.  And I'm like, what if I dump this whore?  And he goes, well, so what?  She'll be fucking a new guy still giving you credit for that rose.  That's the beauty of giving one of these.  Even if the girl, like, let's just say the girl you're with catches you cheating.  Let's say she comes home and you're fucking the dog and she breaks up with you.  She'll find the new guy in 10 years from now.  She'll be looking at this long stem rose with her dumb fat feet in the air.  And she'll go, ugh, the guy that fucked the dog gave me that. 
[03:53:00]  So she'll have to think of that while her new husband is fucking her and her dumb children are playing.  Hopefully eating poisonous things in the next room.  Because you never want to see a woman who leaves you have kids that live.  So what are you waiting for, my friends?  Order yours today.  Steven Singer sells out of roses every year.  In fact, some colors are already gone.  The, uh, he has one called, um, a scrotal pale, which sold out immediately, unfortunately.  That's a really hot one.  It's got like a, it's kind of a ball bag cover.  It's got like a shadowing to mimic two-day pubes. 
[03:53:30]  Steven still has a few of his most popular, uh, premium colors left, but not for long.  Limited qualities are available, so reserve yours today.  You have nothing else to do.  Uh, he makes it very, very easy.  I hate stevensinger.com.  There's a real long stem rose.  Click on that and choose your color.  Actually, don't click on it.  Just choose your color.  Each rose comes with your own personalized message.  And, uh, so whatever you want to say.  Hey!  Nice clitto!  That's a good one.  Nice clitto!  This guy, uh, you can trust. 
[03:54:00]  We, uh, we really genuinely do like Steven.  I mean, we, we fuck with him, but we do love this guy.  You can go to Philadelphia and visit him.  If you don't trust the online thing, if you're one of these paranoid, uh, paranoid doomsday prepper  idiots, uh, just go to the other corner of 8th and Walnut or call 1-88-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.  Or if you do trust computers like everyone else on the planet, go to IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER.com.  But I just, I don't feel like doing a read today, so I just wanted to talk about him naturally.  Who's next, E-Roc?  Well, tying into the dog fucking, uh, Bob in Texas has an animal porn question.  Okay, hello, Bob in Texas. 
[03:54:30]  Hi, Jimmy.  Love you.  Love the show.  Thank you, Bob.  I got a question for you, Jimmy.  Sure.  I've been getting into, uh, you know, really weird, freaked out shit on, uh, uh, one of  these animal sex websites.  And, uh, in just general conversation, my girl, you know, was kind of hinted to it in the past  that maybe, possibly, she may have done something.  How do I sit there and get her to fuck a dog for me?  Well, uh, are you, are you, are you honestly kidding or are you serious?  No, I'm dead serious.  On, to be, that's a tough one, uh, because I've never, bestiality is not my thing. 
[03:55:00]  Now, what, do you know that a dog did something to her or no?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She was talking about she was drunk at a party and somebody else had brought it up and, uh,  there may have been some, uh, tongue to clit action going on.  See, now, I've had girls tell me that, believe it or not.  And I had one girl tell me she got turned on by a certain animal fuck video.  And I had a one woman one time confess that she fucked a dog.  And animal porn is not my thing.  It's never been my thing. 
[03:55:30]  Um, I don't think it's mean if a dog fucks you.  Oh, I don't, I don't mean I like to see, you know, I don't think a guy should fuck a  small hen, you know, an angrily donkey punching a hen.  I think you have major emotional problems.  But, um, you know, if a woman wants to lay there and fucking, you know, think and do  her taxes while a dog sticks his dick in her, fucking shoots up her fucking stupid hips.  That's her business.  I don't, I don't know what the answer to that is because it's such a bizarre thing. 
[03:56:00]  It turned me on that these women were so devious.  The aspect of that turned me on while we're, we're thinking about animal porn or seeing animal  porn would not.  How do you get a girl to do that?  I don't know.  And you better be aware or you better be ready to actually never be able to unsee that.  Like they say when you, you see something, you can't unsee it.  So why don't you do something, uh, you know, watch animal porn while you fuck her maybe. 
[03:56:30]  Um, or do things, I'll go down on her while she's watching a dog eat pussy in a, in a movie.  Try to bridge the real activity from the fetish and see if you get weirded out along the way.  Like don't just bring home a fucking, you know, drug dealer's pit bull and let it bite  her pussy out.  Uh, I would very slowly, I would very slowly bridge that one.  And you might want to keep that one just as fantasy.  Sometimes things dude are better left as fantasy because it happens and it may not turn you 
[03:57:00]  on as much as you think.  So be very, very sure that you're both ready for that.  Yeah.  Well, the thing that I'm worried about is, you know, the, the aftermath, you know, it's  just like when you're sitting there and you're watching, you know, some freaky, you know,  blood porn or something like that.  And you know, that two seconds of guilt afterwards and when you're cleaning up, I mean, that's,  that's the only thing that I worry about.  Yeah.  And where do you go from there?  Like what happens is if you, cause that sounds to me, if you're talking, if you and your  wife are talking about fucking a dog, you both have probably sexually addictive behavior.  Uh, I mean, normal people have kink, but when it comes to bringing in other species, I would 
[03:57:30]  say that goes into sexually addictive behavior.  So what's going to happen is eventually that won't be enough.  And then how do you top that?  Where do you go?  Like you don't want to put yourself in such a corner that the only word place to go is  horse or child or like you never want to be there.  So I would suggest, uh, keep this one as fantasy as long as you can and then just enjoy talking  about it and being kinky, uh, and maybe make lateral movements, but you don't want to have 
[03:58:00]  to progress beyond this.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't want to come home from work and, you know, find a pack of dogs in the living  room.  You know what I mean?  Of course not.  And you also don't want to be that replaceable where if all of a sudden, you know, you're  fucking, you have to stay late at work.  She can just go out to the fucking, you know, throw her feet up and, you know, let Snoopy  eat her box.  I mean, you know, you want, you want to, you want to be special in her life.  You don't want to be replaced by a dog.  All right, my friend.  He left.  Oh, he left.  Okay.  Good luck.  Uh, Steve in Virginia Beach has a question about your movie career.  Oh God.  Yeah.  Well, this will be a very obviously fast, fast, uh, answering question. 
[03:58:30]  Jesus, I suck.  Good improv.  Fucking turd tits.  Hi, Steve.  Yes.  What's up, buddy?  Yes, sir.  I watched your special on Netflix.  Thank you.  And when you go to your name.  Yeah, it was great, by the way.  Thank you very much.  And, um, you're credited to being some different movies.  I scanned through a couple of them, but I couldn't find you in them.  I don't know if it was a mistake or what.  Oh, there's a guy named Jim Norton.  He's an older guy. 
[03:59:00]  He's a, he's like a real Irish actor.  Yeah.  He's been in some, yeah, there's some Irish films in there.  And there's one I definitely knew you weren't it, but I was wondering, the boy in the striped  pajamas.  Not me.  No.  It's funny.  I want to meet this guy because I'm sure he Googles himself and the things that he, like,  for me, I'm seeing legitimate films come up.  He's got to see Jim Norton died of AIDS and fucking got blown into reports by friends.  He must hate when he Googles my name.  And I think with AFTRA and stuff, you're supposed to use different names or SAG. 
[03:59:30]  Like, I think my technical name is Jim J. Norton, like Jim J. Bullock or J. I forget  how I did it, but I, my legitimate work name is Jim Norton and my professional name is Jim  Norton.  So I use that.  So, um, you know, he and I just get crossed up in the mix every once in a while.  It happens.  So.  All right, buddy.  Thanks.  You're very welcome.  Do you want to do the last one or do you want to?  Let's do another call.  Another call.  Yeah, man.  Um, Scott in Pennsylvania has questions about prostitutes. 
[04:00:00]  Oh, good.  I'll have answers.  Scott.  What's up, Scott?  Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, uh, I just kind of got the same issue as you as I'm like addicted to prostitutes.  Sure.  And I don't know how the hell to get away from it.  Well, the same thing like any other addiction.  If you really want to get away from it because you know that you're not doing it because you're  horny, you're doing it because you're lonely or because you want love.  Go to try therapy or a 12 step program. 
[04:00:30]  To me, those are the best ways because the prostitution is it's like the drinking for  an alcoholic.  It's not just the hookers.  That's there's there's underlying stuff which is causing that like the hooker is the symptom,  but the real problem is underneath that.  So if you just kind of cold turkey and don't go to hookers, you're probably going to replace  it with something else unhealthy.  So I would suggest going to a 12 step or therapy and getting to the root of what's underneath  that stuff.  And like maybe you feel that's all you deserve or maybe you have a trouble connecting emotionally 
[04:01:00]  or maybe you have a trouble with intimacy.  So like those are the things you should fix.  And again, I know that I'm pot calling the kettle black because I have a hard time too.  So I'm not coming off better than you or holier than now.  I get how hard it is, but I do know what to do and that's what you should do.  Yeah, that's kind of what I'm trying to do, but I don't know.  I almost like just, you know, I have somebody come over, do your duty and get the fuck out, 
[04:01:30]  you know?  Yeah, I know.  Believe me, you know, I understand the the fun of prostitution.  I understand the upswing and then the good part of it.  But I'm only saying it's obviously bothering you and you're trying to stop.  So the way to stop, like I know that I'm continuing to behave like with porn and stuff  in an addictive way, but I make that dumb choice a lot.  But I know I'm making a dumb choice.  You know, I would suggest trying to try the meetings because then it really wrecks a lot  of your sexual acting out because a lot of times I jerk off. 
[04:02:00]  I'm like, I should be at a meeting or I should be talking to somebody or I should be picking  up the phone.  And, you know, you start to think like, fuck, I should be doing this better and healthier.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Good luck, buddy.  Do you want a problem?  You know, you have this really weird thing with with with with prostitutes.  And it's like it's not necessarily sexy.
