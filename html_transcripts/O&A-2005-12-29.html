<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show began with Drew Boogie in studio.  The hosts discussed their upcoming long weekend, plans for adding studio cameras, and their Paltalk experiences, noting significant Arab male participation and subsequent moderator efforts to remove them, leading to humorous, inaccurate speculation about the Arabic meaning of "Opie." They also talked about paid models in adult Paltalk rooms, Tommy Chong's appearance, and Paltalk sign-up issues.  The conversation shifted to their comedy tours, listener Paltalk navigation problems (including passwords and anti-harassment warnings), and their "real" highlights of 2005: Tara Reid's disastrous TV show and boob job, Pat O'Brien's sex tapes, the Runaway Bride's mugshot, Ashley Simpson's lip-syncing incident, and the trend of teacher-student sexual relationships.  The show featured many listener calls, including one from a frequent caller recognized by Opie despite a name change. An audio clip of a loud orgasm was played, along with other listener-submitted audio, and the hosts discussed an upcoming Best Bits compilation. Iron Sheik made a brief guest appearance.  The show ended with plans to find Jimmy Norton a girlfriend using a Sean Lennon-esque method.

The next segment started with a happy birthday for Jimmy Norton, followed by a discussion of a "horse fuck snuff film" involving a man's death during sex with a horse on a Washington State farm.  Drew Boogie promoted an upcoming Tower Theater event.  Bodog.net was advertised, with Anthony discussing his use of the site.  A segment on 2006 technology predictions covered broadband wireless, Wi-Fi expansion, in-flight internet, cell phone anxieties on planes and trains, and video-on-demand on phones. Opie expressed his dislike for Queen Latifah. A highly offensive phone call with a Geico representative ensued.  A brief, sarcastic interaction with Ted Nugent occurred. Conan O'Brien's observation about large cell phones in older movies was discussed.  A significant portion focused on the decline of traditional radio versus satellite radio (XM), criticizing traditional radio's advertising and outdated technology. Anti-satellite radio commercials were played and mocked. A lengthy critique of Lou Reed's music followed. Video blogs were discussed, along with Drew Boogie's difficulties collaborating with Gray Wolf on a song (including sexually explicit and offensive language).  A segment on hidden messages in gifts failed due to audio issues.  A call with Bob Kelly concluded the segment.

A following segment started with a discussion of airline frequent flyer program abuse, featuring anecdotes about Bob Kelly and Patrice's flights.  This transitioned into a discussion about the hidden meanings of gifts, with guest Nicole Belan from Women's Health Magazine analyzing the psychological implications of gift choices, sparking vulgar jokes and comments. Greg the Trucker briefly called in. The discussion focused on shoes and other household appliances. Singapore's strict laws, especially concerning drug smuggling (referenced with *Midnight Express*), were discussed. The gift-giving discussion resumed, followed by Gary Glitter's alleged payments to victims' families. Two news stories followed: a hotel near Kennedy Airport operating as a brothel and a drunken two-year-old under a drunk babysitter's care, leading to a humorous bit.  A drunken Steve-O appearance on Adam Carolla's show, where Steve-O tried to strangle Carolla, was discussed with audio and video clips. An EMT caller recounted his experience at the drunken toddler's home.  The segment concluded with new audio and video pieces featuring recurring characters like "Silly Danny" and "Dry Nathaniel."

Another segment featured a "Guess What's in My Pants" segment on Paltalk with Hootie McBoob, involving sexually explicit comments and technical difficulties. Donkey Sausage also called in. Eddie K. Thomas, actor from *American Pie* and *Freddy Got Fingered*, joined the studio, discussing his career, his play *Dog Sees God*, interactions with Natasha Lyonne, and the hosts' past encounters with him. The show concluded with an interview with a Long Island Press reporter about the show's role in increasing XM's subscriber base.

The final excerpt discussed Amy Fisher and her relationship with Joey Buttafuoco, her current life, and her proximity to one of the hosts' mothers. A New Year's Eve show at the Tower Theater with Drew Boogie, Colin, and Voss was promoted. The show ended with thank-yous and promotions for upcoming content.

[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Please use them. 
[00:05:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hello, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  Hello, exactly.  I stink and I don't like it. 
[00:05:30]  I stink and I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Pardon my friends, but you're an asshole.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:06:00]  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  I don't want to wait a bit.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  Those guys are mad. 
[00:06:30]  I don't play it.  I don't play it.  You need to shut the fuck up.  I don't play it.  I don't believe it.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The O and A virus spreading across America. 
[00:07:00]  Drew Boogie in studio.  That means it's the last day before we take a little break.  A little break ski.  Hi.  Actually, well, we're just taking tomorrow off.  We'll be back Monday.  Don't you worry about it.  Just going to take a long weekend.  And Drew Boogie comes in here the day before, like, before we take a vacation or a couple days off or before a holiday or something.  He's now waving to the webcam.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  Hello, fellow county.  Obviously a newbie.  Eventually you just kind of not wave at it. 
[00:07:30]  Forget it.  Well, Opie's been pretty lucky.  You've been off cam pretty much the entire time.  Start from your creepy peaks around the video monitors that I'm looking at.  But that's all I give them.  Monday.  That's all I'm going to give them is the creepy peaks.  Doesn't matter.  Monday, we're getting office cam and another studio cam in here with a different angle.  So we'll be, I don't know, maybe up there. 
[00:08:00]  You thinking?  Maybe.  Maybe over on that side so you can get the two sides of the room kind of thing.  And then you can pop up three different cameras.  Watch us doing the show in here from two different angles.  And, I don't know, can cameras pick up Ben if he's in the office?  Do they have something that could pick up something moving so quickly?  Well, you were just looking at the Zapruder film where they took out the shakes.  Yeah, they took out the shakes.  They stabilized it.  So we need to get that technology for the office cam when they're taking a peek at Ben. 
[00:08:30]  The borders will really be moving around because that's how you'd have to stabilize Ben in the office to check him out.  And see what he does all day.  You'll see him at his email highlighting text and then unhighlighting it.  And then highlighting it and unhighlighting it.  Scroll, highlight.  Yeah.  That's what you'll see.  Action packed.  Good old Ben.  But, yeah, everybody's peering in today.  Hello to everybody. 
[00:09:00]  Checking out the show on Pal Talk.  Pal Talk.  It's going to be taking off even at night.  There are various Opie and Anthony rooms that are consistently number one as far as how many people are in there.  Last night I popped in.  By the way, people, by the way, I popped in last night under my pseudonym.  Pseudonym?  Which will not be given out to anybody.  No one knows this pseudonym.  I just peek in every so often to see what's going on. 
[00:09:30]  See what they're yapping about when I'm not in the room.  Are you one of the guys jerking when you're in your pseudonym?  Well, Opie, I pan the camera down and pull my little pants down and just start jacking off.  Because that seems to be what every guy is doing on Pal Talk.  There are the adult rooms, and people are jacking in those.  No, I don't really frequent those.  Some of the names of the adult rooms, you know, while the hubby's away, the wives will play. 
[00:10:00]  Things like that.  Hot chicks.  Things like that.  But when you go there, it's guys jacking.  Where are the girls there when the hubby's are away and the hot chicks?  There's a couple of them thrown in there.  Yeah, but Drew Boogie made a point just before the show started.  He thinks some of those girls are ringers.  You think they're ringers?  Some of those girls are like pros. 
[00:10:30]  Some of those girls are...  What do you have to back this up?  They may have been hired just to kind of hang out all day in their little rooms.  Hmm.  There's a couple of women on there.  They've got like three, four kids.  And they're on there for probably the entire day.  Really?  Tweaking their nipples.  Tweaking their twats.  This could be just women that are hanging out a little horned up.  What a great part-time job for some of these ladies.  Exactly.  The kids go to school.  She wants to make a few extra bucks, maybe for Christmas shopping or something. 
[00:11:00]  She just hangs out naked all day.  Helps sell some subscriptions.  Those girls are paid some of them, right?  You think so?  Yeah, I think so.  Do you think?  Absolutely.  You've got to think.  I've seen a lot of regular-looking girls on there.  Oh, there's some disasters, but I think he's right.  Disasters.  And a celebrity was on last night in one of the rooms.  Tommy Chong was on.  In one of our rooms?  Or just in general?  I don't know if it was one of our rooms, but there were a lot of whack-bag people  and a lot of show people in the room with them. 
[00:11:30]  I was just listening, and I heard them yapping.  Hey, man.  Hey.  I like what she's doing with her tits, man.  Like, you guys just a waste.  He's not a waste.  He did our show.  We had a great time with him.  Oh, someone researched what Opie means in Arabic.  Do you want to explain that?  Thank God.  Well, we have this problem.  Every time we log on in the morning here for the program, the room is Opie and Anthony live.  It's the name of the room. 
[00:12:00]  You could peer in and watch us do the show.  And then we're noticing when we log on for the first time that Arabs, just a shitload of Arab men are logging into this site.  And I'm like, what is, is this just some common practice?  But no, it's not happening in any of the other rooms, except for the Arab rooms.  So we're kicking them out, you know, booting them left and right.  That's how you start this whole thing.  You kick out all the Arabs.  Yeah, all the Arabs just get kicked out. 
[00:12:30]  Symbolic, isn't it?  It is symbolic, but it's more so like, let's make room for the people that appreciate the Opie and Anthony program.  And maybe appreciate America.  America.  And don't fly planes into buildings.  Right.  God, I hope I'm some Arabian, like, king or something.  I don't know, because, well, we found out the name Opie has something to do with this Arab thing.  And they saw Opie in the name and just flocked to it like the sheep they are. 
[00:13:00]  Just flocked.  And half of the moderators and admins that I've personally appointed for this room spend most of the time kicking out Arabs.  That's their job.  Well, this guy did some research.  Eric in Montana.  Eric.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey.  You know, I got online yesterday and I just typed in Opie comma Arabic into MSN and Google searches.  And the only thing I can find on it is out of the University of Akron, something to do with an English as a second language type program. 
[00:13:30]  The only thing I could find, it only pulled up like 1,500 references.  And I went through it and that was all I could find.  Someone else found something, though.  I'm very surprised.  But the other question I have is I have a real problem with PalTalk.  I have been trying to sign up for a PalTalk account for a week.  All I'm getting are error messages that tells me to contact PalTalk, administration, and then does not give me a way to contact them. 
[00:14:00]  Huh.  Maybe a problem with your computer or they're busy or something.  I don't know.  I know we're bringing a lot of people on board for them for, you know, whatever that's worth.  Yeah, I don't know.  I tried all Christmas weekend.  It keeps giving me these error messages.  Yeah.  So I don't know what the deal is with it.  But that's the only reference I could find to Opie in Arabic.  Like, I even talked to some friends of mine who are from the Middle East, and none of them can think of any other references.  I actually looked it up, sir. 
[00:14:30]  It's not easy to find if you do a shirt.  But Opie, it's an Arabic god who's a blonde-haired Arabic god with a chiseled body.  Nice try, Jimmy.  Hey, Jimmy, I got a question for you.  All right.  Click.  What is the problem with getting you or Bill Burr or Voss or any of those guys out here in the West, like Colorado or any place like that?  The comedy clubs out here keep saying that they have been turned down when trying to get you guys out here. 
[00:15:00]  That's probably not true.  I just think that we have to wait until an audience is built up.  And I haven't really done much road work because I didn't know what the Louis schedule was.  But I'll get out there soon.  I want to get out to Colorado to the comedy works.  Eric, it's good that you mentioned that because in the new year we're going to start an Opie and Anthony comedy tour with some of these guys.  So we're going to see who's available, and we're going to throw them on the road for a certain amount of dates.  We'll probably start in some of the bigger cities that we're popular in and then start branching out to places like Montana.  All right?  I'm a trucker, and I live in Colorado. 
[00:15:30]  So I checked with the comedy club down there the other day, and I keep trying to get you guys in there, and they keep saying all they –  Oh, who knows?  All right.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Hold on.  Someone wants to talk to you around here for some reason.  He hung up.  I was trying to keep him on hold.  Steve needed him for some reason.  Apparently the reference is something like Opus Dei or something.  Like they're just getting confused is what it is.  It's not quite Opie, but it's close enough where a few of them come over.  A lot of them come over. 
[00:16:00]  Do I need to go in the room and make a statement to my people?  To your Arabic people?  To my Arabic people?  Don't be surprised if I come to work on Monday with, like, a turban.  Oh, you're going to be a raghead?  Well, I think I might have to.  I got some followers.  Keep your people in check.  That's how it starts.  I got some followers.  I got to start growing the really bad beard, and I'm going to have some kind of turban.  Big, bushy beard.  I think I'm going to start growing, like, what is it, the sideburns to the point where you have to roll them? 
[00:16:30]  Is that – they do that?  I don't know.  I'll take a little bit from everybody.  The big, bushy, Iraqi mustache is what you need.  That's good.  And just say my friend all the time.  My friend.  Big, bushy, Iraqi mustache.  They all love those.  Coke Logic from whackbag.com.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on?  I know what Opie means in Arabic.  Yeah.  It's a holy marshmallow smuggler.  All right.  Holy marshmallows.  The marshmallow, a very holy and sacred item in the Arabic world.  Why do you have to bring me down? 
[00:17:00]  I'm feeling pretty good that I might be some Arabian prince or something, and you have to bring it right down to the gutter.  You are the furthest thing from an Arabian anything.  It's a man who saved his family from the bitings of a dog by kicking it.  In ancient Arabic.  Dog liver, very sacred.  We're going to have to all kneel mid-show to pray.  Yes.  Get your praying rugs out.  Pray to the mix. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, well, we're still trying to figure out what that's about, but Anthony, kicking out Arabs every morning before.  Yeah, they all get kicked out.  Before the real listeners pop into the room.  They're pretty worthless in the room, to tell you the truth.  Yeah.  You don't want to see a big, uncut, hairy mess jacking off, do you?  What do you use this for?  Jacking off?  You don't want to see that.  Hey, where's our pal, Iron Sheik?  Iron Sheik.  Maybe he can address some of the Arabs.  Yeah, give me a little Iron Sheik there.  Iron Sheik.  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation, three-time champion, All-American AAU champion. 
[00:18:00]  It's a pleasure for me today.  Anthony and I hope you bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans.  And everybody know I'm the real Middle Easter man.  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison, Suri Garden. 
[00:18:30]  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American and also my Iranian friend.  I want to say hello to all the world, Iron Sheik, and I want to say hello to all the world, Iron Sheik, and I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to talk to the Opion and Anthony, and pleasure for me always.  All right, that might have made the problem worse. 
[00:19:00]  Especially with his little code word, whatever the hell that was, that little sentence.  Ooh, that could have made things a little worse.  It was something, something wrestling, get your pilot's license.  Wrestling, wrestling, something.  Let's go to Matt in New Jersey.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Matt.  How come you guys don't put, like, a disclaimer across when you first enter the room?  You know how, like, all the other rooms have that disclaimer that says, hey, it's not an Arab room or whatever?  No, the message up there, the non-jacking room is what it says.  Actually, I believe we have a message up there that's supposed to be don't harass the ladies because that's what people are getting booted for. 
[00:19:30]  A lot of people, I read instant feedback, then I get emails every day from people that are saying, dude, I sign up, I go on, and I'm immediately booted out.  You know, which I'm thinking kind of sucks.  So I start talking to some of the admins and saying, why are these people being booted?  The first thing they do when they get up there is just any girl in the room, show me your cunt, bitch.  I want to see your fucking tits.  And then, boom, you're fucking out. 
[00:20:00]  You get bounced from the room for 24 hours.  You're out of it.  For misbehaving.  Misbehaving.  I've told them to be a little more tolerant than people with names because some people are getting kicked just for their names, but they don't know.  They sign up.  They think it's funny to have a, you know, show me your clit as their name, and they pop in the room, and they get thrown out.  But they should be warned, like, change your fucking name or something, because it's not a room about our fucking listeners getting tit shots. 
[00:20:30]  It happens.  The girls do flash when they feel like it, but it's not just all about guys fucking, show me your tits, let me see your clit, I've got to jerk off, I want to see.  That's for us to do here in the studio.  That's actually my first name.  Is it?  Yeah, show me your tits, show me your clit, I want to jerk off.  That must be tough to write on a check there, Jimmy.  4-0-1-1-9, because a few other people had that name.  All right.  Ooh, Tech Trends for 2006. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  What's going to be the hot items?  We're going to see.  We're going to see later on today, hopefully.  Dan in Philly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Opie, you were saying yesterday to call in about the real highlights of 2005.  Yes.  I got one.  How about after Tara Patrick's boob falling out after her horrendous tit job?  Oh, see, that was a great highlight of 2005.  Absolutely.  Tara Reid.  Oh, Tara Reid.  It's okay.  You ass hat.  I understood what you meant, though. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  And one of the highlights for me was Tara Reid's TV show.  Yeah, why didn't that make any of the great lists?  Did that make a bad TV list or something?  Because I know that one of those are out today.  Oh, yeah.  Where's the bad TV list?  They're calling it terrible.  I think it did make that.  I think it's in the post.  Yeah, well, that tit job was just absolutely horrendous that she had.  All right.  Yeah, one of the things we're doing on the show today is doing the real highlights of 2005,  not these cute little lists that all the papers and magazines are doing. 
[00:22:00]  But you're right, Anthony.  Tara Reid's show was one of the worst TV shows of the year.  We loved the Tara.  Loved it.  It was one of those bad shows that were so bad, she was so horrifically bad, that it  was so entertaining to watch her and listen to every bit of babble that poured out of  her mouth.  It was a sad day when we found out that that show got canceled.  Yes.  Do we have a little taste of Tara Dice maybe we could give the people today?  A little taste of Tara.  Tara.  For all the new listeners that are just finding the program for the first time because they 
[00:22:30]  got their XM for Christmas and they got it all hooked up and ready to go here.  Someone says I'm wrong.  About what?  I don't know.  I like calling out people that I think I'm wrong.  Sometimes they're right.  Matt, was I in error?  You fucked up, Professor.  What did I do?  Opus Dei.  It's a hyper-conservative Catholic organization where they actually punish themselves physically  as part of their penance.  Yeah?  No Arabs in that?  No Arabs whatsoever.  I also just wanted to throw in about the Pound Talk. 
[00:23:00]  The guy tried to boot me off if I didn't have an Opie and Anthony reference.  He's like, do you know the show?  If you're not, we're going to kick you out.  A reference?  Yeah.  I threw in Java log and jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep in order to stay up the room.  They're like passwords.  That's funny.  That you need.  Well, what if somebody just wants to check it out and that's how they were turned on  to the show?  Shit out of luck, man.  We're going to need some kind of protocol here in this room.  Yeah, we're figuring it all out.  I think you let the people in.  When they fuck up, then you throw them out.  Yeah.  But you've got to give them the benefit of the doubt because it's turning new people 
[00:23:30]  onto the show.  I've got to tell you, we're building our own society slowly but surely.  That's what we have to do, Opie.  I hear from people that got married because of this radio show.  That's got to be a disaster right there.  And they've had kids because of this radio show.  Man on man.  You know what she's saying about the wedding with a black eye in the hospital?  I believe this is the first radio show that doesn't end.  Gary Glitter decided to go to Southeast Asia because of this show.  Yeah, we understand.  It makes an impact. 
[00:24:00]  But this show doesn't end.  We go off the air at, what, 11 on the East Coast here?  But they continue all day, all night, message boards, fan sites, webcams, what have you.  You cannot believe how late.  Gatherings.  These things go on.  And local bars in their area.  I know.  I pop on the sites every so often at night.  And I'm like, I've got to go.  And then they yell at me.  Get to bed.  You're not going to be able to do a show tomorrow, asshole.  Right.  Like I've got listeners yelling at me to go to bed, that it's my beddy buy time. 
[00:24:30]  And that they don't want me fucking up the next day.  Up a little late?  Yeah.  All the time, though.  Up a little late, aren't you?  Got to be up early.  Someone gave me that last week when we had a day off and I typed back like that.  I was like, day off tomorrow, ass fuck.  Showed him.  Sure did.  That kind of language isn't necessary.  Yeah, why the language?  That's what I do.  Why the language, Anthony?  Because it's typed.  The F's there.  You.  See?  It's right there on the keyboard.  You might as well use them.  Now I want to see the list of the worst TV shows of the year.  Paradise made it.  And one of our favorite shows we talked about during the year. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  Who's Your Daddy?  Who's Your Daddy?  Oh, what did they pick?  Like the tasteless shows?  The ones that are a fan.  Yeah.  They got to bring back Who's Your Daddy?  Remember that.  Was that politically incorrect?  Remember that blonde bimbo with the breast implants trying to find her father?  Crying.  They brought out a bunch of guys.  Do we have any of that audio, Hawk?  That might be hard to find.  Especially the one where she's just crying when she finds her daddy.  Dude, it was one of those shows that are like the dating shows where they get one chick,  they put a bunch of guys in a house, and they live together, 
[00:25:30]  and they go on dates with the chick and stuff like that.  It was like that.  The twist was there were older men, and one of them was her long-lost father  that gave her up when she was a kid.  And she had all these father issues and everything,  and that was the show that was going to reintroduce her to Daddy.  And she's crying, and the father's crying.  That show brought back for Pat from Munaki.  It was great, though.  He could hook up.  It was the cruelest show ever. 
[00:26:00]  It was the cruelest show.  Oh, yeah.  She's just standing in front of these older men,  and one of them is her daddy, and they're not telling her.  What if one guy, like, she really got in her head like,  oh, I hope that's my father.  He's really like the nice guy.  And then this guy's a real asshole, and the asshole turns out to be the dad.  Yeah.  The guy that copped the feel and they hugged.  Whoa.  Scrabbed a big hunk of ass.  Technically, it's his.  Oh.  Hey, they're calling intervention.  It's not A&E, one of the worst shows of 2005.  Why?  That's entertaining. 
[00:26:30]  The real Gilligan's Island made the list.  Yeah, that's horrible.  A show called The Will.  I didn't.  The what?  The Will.  The Will.  I guess a dude dies, and then what?  They got to figure out.  Jesus.  Who we left the money to?  How to divvy the will up?  CBS unveiled this series the first week of January  and yanked it after a single telecast.  That's why no one saw it.  As a result, we never did learn which of Bill Long's family members and hangar-ons impressed  him enough to win the ranch he was offering as this reality show's prize.  Ah.  To viewers, though, the only impressive thing here was the utter inhumanity of the entire 
[00:27:00]  enterprise.  Inhumanity.  Stop.  Ah, real Gilligan's Island, yes.  Martha behind bars.  Blech.  But Can They Sing?  I like But Can They Sing.  That was really funny.  Battle of the Network, Reality Stars was a bomb, and of course, Britney and Kevin doing  Chaotic was a huge disaster.  Dude, he's a good rapper on that.  I love his music.  That guy's fantastic.  All right.  See, and I got to give this warning, also every morning. 
[00:27:30]  Huh.  The instant messages.  I am a busy, busy, busy man here on this program.  You're a star.  I'm a star.  I'm fancy.  I don't have time for a couple of hundred people I-eming me on this goddamn pal talk every  day.  You will be banned.  What'd that bum say to you?  Look at this fucking I-em that popped up.  I don't like it.  It says, when will there be a new Prof Anthony? 
[00:28:00]  What does that mean?  What does it even fucking mean?  He's losing his mind.  What's his name?  Who said that?  His name?  The future Mr. Bounce from the room in three seconds when I say his fucking name?  Is hacked by Twitchy.  Hacked by Twitchy.  Yeah.  Eep, eep, eep.  Go ahead.  I am me.  Right up until they bounce you in two seconds.  I would say, don't I-em Anthony again and you won't get bounced. 
[00:28:30]  How about that?  No, he already did three times.  Oh, did he really?  Three times.  Oh, okay.  Bye.  And I rule with an iron fist.  You sure do.  I don't give a warning.  I give a warning to the rest of the people by executing one person.  Maybe this guy didn't know the rules.  Now he knows.  And now everyone else knows how really serious.  Because if you don't do this, you know what happens?  I warn him.  Everyone I-ems me as a joke.  Now, one guy off with his head.  He's gone.  And now who's going to, who dare I am again?  I bet you there's some funny ones that come up, though.  You guys should I-em. 
[00:29:00]  Ah, someone just I-ems.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Let's make them famous.  All right.  Let's see.  Nuisance 777.  Lucci and Papa Goulash love the penis, is what he's saying.  Oh.  To you?  Yeah.  He wanted me to know that.  Oh.  He wanted me to know that.  Cool.  All right.  I am blocking everybody.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  I dare people to I-em you.  Oh, fuck.  You're spelled, Jimmy Norton. 
[00:29:30]  See, we're not, we're going to try not to do a radio show for 150 people in a webcam room.  Right.  Because the rest of the country's like, who cares?  Rob on Long Island, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Good morning, Fuzzy Nipples.  Hello.  Yeah.  I just wanted to know, are you guys going to be bringing the webcams?  Is there any way to set them up there?  Yes, there is absolutely a way to set them up.  Yeah, we're going to be at CES in Vegas, what, doing shows Thursday and Friday, I guess. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, as long as we got a laptop.  Wednesday, we're taking off to fly, and then Thursday and Friday, we do two-hour shows.  It's the biggest joke.  A lot of pressure, those two hours, Opie, and, you know, got to stay well-rested for the late nights of gambling.  And then, of course, we're there for the weekend.  Yeah.  Just for the fuck of it.  Oh, yeah, and then we have to take Monday off because we're flying back Monday.  What is that?  Even though we're done with the shows Friday.  Right.  Three days to recover and just, what, get the radio heads back together?  Right.  I'm not used to this new way of doing radio.  In commercial radio, they fucking just work you to the bone. 
[00:30:30]  This satellite radio is a breeze, man.  Like an animal.  We're taking tomorrow off.  We work two full days, Monday and Tuesday.  Then we take Wednesday off to fly.  Then we do Thursday and Friday, but we're only doing two hours each of those days.  And then we spend the weekend in Vegas and then have to take Monday off because we're flying back.  Yeah.  What's up, Rob?  Yeah.  For one of the highlights of 05, do you think that the perverted justice date line was on  them?  Oh, my God.  Dude, you crapped out right at the punchline there. 
[00:31:00]  Perverted justice or something like that?  The perverted justice date line.  You think that would be one of them?  That was definitely a highlight of 2005.  That's one of the real highlights of 2005.  Have a good day, guys.  See you later.  All right.  One of the real highlights of 2005?  Yeah.  The Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Oh, my God.  That's a real highlight of 2005.  Was that brought up in any list?  Nope.  That was huge.  It was?  Than is saying yes.  Well, fantastic.  Well, the Post kind of, it's a coincidence, obviously. 
[00:31:30]  I'm not going to claim a hoo-hoo, you're ripping me off.  Tell them, Fred.  But, uh, yesterday we were on the show and said, give us the real highlights of 2005.  The New York Post made it very easy for us.  75 things to love about 2005.  75?  Yeah.  We're not going to read all of them, obviously.  But Pat O'Brien's voicemail messages obviously made the list.  The best.  Stuff like Robot Chicken made the list.  Mm-hmm.  I hear that's a great thing.  I haven't checked that out yet.  Yeah.  The Runaway Bride's mugshot. 
[00:32:00]  Remember her?  Runaway Bride.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The chick that made a break for it left the altar.  Oh, right.  The big googly eyes.  I claim that she got banged by Mexicans in a van or whatever it was.  Right.  Had a little fantasy in Vegas.  And then they found an old mugshot of her with her googly eyes.  Her googly eyes.  Paris Hilton's pets made the list.  Yeah.  She was walking around with this endangered species.  No, it wasn't the puppy, Anthony.  It was the...  Oh, that cankachu?  Yeah, it was that half monkey, half whatever the hell it was. 
[00:32:30]  Half monkey, half raccoon, or I don't know.  What the fuck that was.  The Puggles made the list.  Puggles.  Ashley Simpson fucking up.  Do we have Ashley Simpson getting booed at the Rose Bowl?  One of my favorites.  Eric, you should break out some of these quick highlights from 2005.  Oh, you got it right here?  This is a huge highlight of 2005.  Ashley Simpson got caught lip syncing on SNL.  And then, I don't know, a month or two later, she went to the Rose Bowl to sing. 
[00:33:00]  And they booed her.  Listen to this.  Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya.  You made me want...  Oh, oh, oh, oh, you made me want...  Ya, ya, ya, ya.  You made me want...  R Estados!  Kelly Clarkson, Trace Adkins, Ashley Simpson, part of our halftime show at the FedEx Orange Bowl. 
[00:33:30]  Kelly Clarkson.  And that announcer's a fraud.  Ashley Simpson.  How do you not address that?  How do you not address the fact that the whole stadium just booed Ashley Simpson?  Holy shit, she is getting fucking booed.  It's almost like Mohamed Atta has walked into the stadium.  Stradio.  Stradio.  You know the three of them are probably backstage after singing and they all knew that she was the one they were booing? 
[00:34:00]  She probably told herself that Kelly Clarkson, they don't like her, but you know, it's you.  No, it was you, stupid.  That was some horrible singing, too.  I mean, oh my god.  Well, here we go.  The real highlights of 2005, we can get right into it.  Prozac from Whack Bag.  You got one?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  One of my true highlights of 05 were the teachers banging the underage students.  Hot shit.  Oh, man, was that a trend?  Hey.  Let's talk about trends in 2005, too.  That was a trend. 
[00:34:30]  Hot teachers banging their students.  That, uh, who was the real hottie?  The blonde.  What was her name?  The blonde.  From Florida, right?  Yeah.  The one from Albany was pretty hot, too.  The one from Florida.  Yeah, but nothing, like, the one from Albany would have been hot if it wasn't for that  other one.  She was just, like, model fucking hot.  Yeah.  Banging some kid.  Very good.  Some lucky little guy.  Sucking on his Twizzler cock.  That's a very good one, Prozac.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Bye.  Well, let's go to Puggle Kicker.  Puggle Kicker. 
[00:35:00]  Hey.  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  I don't like that name one bit.  By the way, if you're a new listener to this show, you can't call in with your real name.  It's just not about that.  No one gives a fuck there's a Keith in Virginia or a John in Utah.  Puggle Kicker.  Right.  Puggle Kicker is calling our program.  What's up?  Hey, Jimmy, you remind me of that gecko in the Geico commercial.  I don't know why, but you just...  All right.  Hold on.  Hey, now.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I recognize the voice.  You're familiar.  What?  This is...  What's your name? 
[00:35:30]  You're the trucker that's all over the place.  You call from a different city every other day.  Max from Dallas.  This is Max from Dallas.  He has changed his name to Puggle Kicker.  You know something?  You...  Fuck...  You stun me on a daily basis with stuff like that.  How did you recognize anyone's voice?  Know their names?  I guarantee...  Know who the...  I guarantee there's a bunch of people out there that go, I recognize that voice.  There's some...  No, they're not.  They're just another person on the phone.  No, it's...  To you, maybe. 
[00:36:00]  I pay attention.  I pay attention, too.  That's weird.  I get a lot of crap, but I have passion for what I do, and I listen very closely.  Hey, hey.  Now I'm taking offense at the fact that you're saying I don't have passion because I don't  identify one guy on a phone full of people.  Yes, I am.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  You should have recognized Max from Dallas.  No.  It's crazy.  How about this?  No, I'm going to go with this one.  You should have recognized his voice.  No.  Max, how many times have you called the show since we started?  Seriously.  Oh, God.  Probably about... 
[00:36:30]  I don't know.  I want to say probably close to 100 times.  This guy has been on our show easily 25, 30 times.  That is just another fucking voice coming out of a box.  Listen to it.  No, it's not.  And he always goes...  And he always has something to say about Jimmy.  It's always, Jimmy, you remind me of this.  Jimmy this.  Jimmy that.  I do recognize this.  The whole pattern of his whole fucking call is the same.  No, that's weird that you know that.  All right, maybe...  That's an obsession.  I know I'm...  It's not an obsession.  It's some kind of OCD thing.  No, it's a Rain Man. 
[00:37:00]  A Rain Man thing.  It's a Rain Man thing.  What?  I think Goofy's just psychic.  No, I'm not psychic.  Pick up the it part and put iconic on.  All right, Max from Dallas, who's now Puggle Kicker.  What's up?  2005 highlight.  The guy that got his fucking mule cheat off by the monkey.  Yeah, that's...  Oh, hey.  Guys, have a good one.  Huge highlight.  That is a massive highlight from 2005.  Huge highlight.  The guy that got his junk foot, hands, nose, face, fingers individual. 
[00:37:30]  Eaten off by a monkey.  Were they chimp?  By a chimp.  Nasty chimpanzee just ripped him apart.  One was going for his face and one for his balls.  Because, yeah, one bit off his wife's thumb and then just started ripping him apart when  he tried to rescue the wife.  And the real tragedy is, like, people say that he was messed up, but she had, like, a whole  career going.  She would do, like, go to parties as a Fonzie impersonator.  We'll direct their career, that chimp bastard. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Now I feel, like, uncomfortable, like I'm some kind of freak.  So now Rich is going to help me out.  Rich in Pennsylvania.  What's up, man?  Anthony's making me feel like a freak today.  Yeah, man, he's always on here.  Wait a minute, Rich.  Rich.  What's up?  You used to go by the name of Bob back in 56.  You used to request songs on American Hot Wax.  That's me, man.  Wolfman Jack used to take your calls.  Yep.  Dude, that guy calls all the time, man. 
[00:38:30]  He's the one that gave Nugent a hard time.  He's telling me about he had all these guns.  I'm telling you, I don't doubt he calls all the time.  There's all the ones I would recognize, and then you would have a point, to be honest  with you, but that guy probably called our show more than anyone else.  I don't doubt he does, and if his name was up there, I wouldn't be amazed.  The fact is, he had a brand new name.  He said three words, and Oop's like, wait a minute, I know who this is.  All right.  Meanwhile, I go to, like, appearances or something, and there's people that show up at every single 
[00:39:00]  one, and I'm like, what's that guy's name?  Who's that?  Like, I can't remember anybody.  Our own interns, until they were hired, I couldn't tell Than from the other guy.  Our brains are wired differently.  Mine is filled with this dumb shit instead of knowledge of the Nazis.  I don't know.  Hey, important stuff there.  I was waiting for him to say something about Jimmy there, but he didn't, man.  I interrupted him, but he usually does something with Jimmy, too. 
[00:39:30]  So, you were going to say something, Jimmy, or something?  I'm just enjoying watching the battle of the mental illness.  It's like the fucking both of you are just trying to convince yourselves that you're not,  you're both hanging on to fucking some kind of sanity by your fingernails.  At least I don't put on German clothes.  At least I don't remember people's names when they call.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Coming from a man whose nails ripped out years ago.  Oh, dude.  I'm filth in shoes.  I know I'm garbage.  All right, let's get a wheel in New Jersey. 
[00:40:00]  Wheel, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you doing?  All right.  Yeah, what about good old Wolf Blitzer?  They're so poor, and they're so black.  That was a real...  And it's such a shame.  That's one of the best highlights of 2005.  That was a good one.  A lot of people watched that.  Here it is.  As much as you see that picture, though, you simply get chills every time you see these poor individuals.  As Jack Capri just pointed out, so tragically, so many of these people, almost all of them that we see are so poor, 
[00:40:30]  and they are so black, and this is going to raise lots of questions for people who are watching this story unfold.  We'll take a quick break.  More of our special comments right after this.  See, that's why I like Drew, because you're kind of black.  Like, they're so black.  They are so black.  I'm moderately white.  Everyone knew what Wolf was trying to...  Like, the point he was trying to get across is there are so many that are black.  Right.  It's not...  They're so poor, and they're just so black. 
[00:41:00]  So black, yes.  That's funny.  That's funny.  If you say, like, a blind date shows up, and you're so black.  But you're so black.  Remember, Lethal Weapon 2?  Drew is so, so black.  Ah, but Drew does a lot of mixing.  That's not a white guy thing.  Ah, Dave in New Jersey.  Musical Gentleman.  Another real highlight of 2005.  Dave.  Oh, hey, it's Scott from Tom Sizemore's Orgasm.  Tom Sizemore's Orgasm.  Of course.  God, now I've got to find that one, because that is great. 
[00:41:30]  Of course.  We're going to find it in a second for you, but that was another real highlight of 2005.  All right, keep it up, guys.  Of 2005.  Well, I can never, um...  And I got it over here.  I can't hide away.  Is it on nine?  I got it.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah.  Tom Sizemore's Orgasm.  One of the highlights of 2005.  This is great.  Oh!  Oh!  Motherfucker!  Yeah!  That's his sex tape, and he really...  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:42:00]  Motherfucker!  But, he just doesn't beat this guy.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  One of our new things we're doing on the show is compiling a bunch of loud orgasms.  Loud orgasms.  And Steve just handed this in, matter of fact.  It's called Loud Orgasm, and it's a hand job. 
[00:42:30]  Maybe Steve could come in here and explain it.  A handy?  From him, his claws got caught in the pibs.  Let's take a listen to this real fast.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:43:00]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Wow!  Yeah!  Yeah!  That was a handy?  Yeah!  That was an aggressive, double-fisted handy.  Oh!  Yeah!  That little guy was packing.  That guy was packing!  That guy was packing!  He was packing!  He needed the two-fister!  Yeah!  Incidentally, I have audio of me having an orgasm.  It's real.  It wasn't put on.  Ew!  It's video.  I will bring it in.  I keep forgetting to go!  God damn it.  But I won't show the video.  I'll just bring in the audio.  Why? 
[00:43:30]  Some years ago.  I forgot I even had it on a videotape.  What's the back history of this?  I videotaped a girl blowing me.  She knew it.  I was holding a video camera.  Yeah.  I forgot that I had this, and I found it, and I heard the orgasm recently.  Is it, um, is it, do a little impression of it.  All right.  E-Rock, good add to the show.  Hold on.  Let me do my impression of Hawk being fired.  Travis, hysterical laughing in the other room. 
[00:44:00]  Certainly is.  Fan running in so he can point and laugh.  He ran in the room just so he can point and laugh at Hawk.  Nice.  We needed the news ticker during that.  It was very nice.  A little impression?  Yeah.  A little impression of what Jimmy's orgasm might have.  That's hungry baby bird.  You do not make that.  No. 
[00:44:30]  You don't do that.  No.  I think I actually, someone told me I remind them of Steve when I come.  That's what this girl said, because I go, oh my God, quickly navigate my cock.  Up and down harder.  Extremely accurate.  Thank you so much, Jimmy.  Can't get over that.  But it's not a game thing.  Your load is being served.  A little soundry joke.  I love that Steve does his impression of Jimmy doing him now.  Because Steve's impression is barely containing himself from planting his Lebanese fist into my cheek. 
[00:45:00]  Because Steve is going, I know you think I sound gay.  How do you like the shit beat that at you?  But it's not that I think he sounds gay.  It's the enunciation of every syllable.  It's the absolute perfect thing.  The gay thing is an offshoot.  That he happens to have that lifestyle.  That's not what I'm trying to get through.  Thank you so much, Jim.  2006 is going to be the year that Steve finally snaps and punches one of us.  Is that a resolution?  Ah, yeah.  No doubt my mind.  He probably has to make a resolution every year, like, not to kill somebody. 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  And like, wow, I did it.  Another year, I didn't kill somebody.  It's part of the 12-step philosophy.  One day at a time.  One week at a time.  One life at a time, not taking it.  Exactly.  And incidentally, my idea did get ripped off about, remember I said that I wanted to do a New  Year's Resolutions.  Well, I've heard the paper stuff doing New Year's Resolutions.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  And probably other radio shows jumping on that bandwagon, too.  Are they in the paper today?  I don't know.  New Year's Resolutions?  No, no, no.  But I just heard that they were doing it.  I know the Sean Lennon crap is in the paper today. 
[00:46:00]  He's looking for a girl.  Do you have to?  I don't know.  You get the whole John Lennon thing going.  Do you have to put an ad on page six?  And of course, he gets a lot of responses.  How could you be Sean Lennon and not just walk out with your checkbook and go, hey,  Sean Lennon, and not just get all the girls you want?  All right, let's try the same thing that Sean did.  He put out an ad that he needs a girl, and he got some responses.  If you've seen the girls, he got responding.  Lovely.  Well, I'd like a girlfriend. 
[00:46:30]  I've been single for a while.  It's been a while.  I'm a little lonely.  I'm a little depressed.  I'd like a gal, pal.  Yeah, let's do what Sean Lennon's doing.  How are we going to do this?  They can email you directly, and then you've got to be fair.  I would say on MySpace, maybe because the picture's right there.  Yeah, if you don't know the story, if it's not in your paper, Sean Lennon, like we just  pretty much said, I'm just going to set it up again.  What do you want to say?  He's lonely.  He hasn't had a girlfriend in a while, and it was in the paper yesterday requesting  that page six, the gossip column of the New York Post, help him find a chick. 
[00:47:00]  And he was dead serious, and he had all these parameters.  He had to be between 18 and 45.  You had to be smart with a high IQ of an IQ of a certain amount, blah, blah, blah.  You've got to be beautiful inside and out.  Why throw in the inside lie?  Just admit it.  Here's my criteria.  You've got to look good.  You've got to be between the ages of 18 and anything under, and your vagina should bulge 
[00:47:30]  like it's covering a gargoyle.  That's what I want your underwear to look like, a gargoyle hat.  So, he wants something hot that he can go to the clubs with.  Exactly.  That was yesterday, and there's already responses in today's paper.  Oh, good for him.  Uh, let's see, like, this girl, Betsy Head, 27, IQ unknown but graduated college cum laude.  She's a theater person, producer, director, bartender. 
[00:48:00]  Likes art, films, travel, running, and theater.  Her quote, I lead a full life and would love to share it with someone.  Oh.  Ugh.  Lisa was socky, 35, 5, 8.  Ah, another, uh, Jap.  Uh.  Like mom.  Ah, fake Jap, though.  Just a little squint.  Little.  Just a slight squint.  Slight squint.  Um, she likes, uh, movies and art, dislikes mushrooms, yicky bugs, and people who don't appreciate 
[00:48:30]  a hug.  She ate.  This was also bad, though.  Favorite book, Catcher in the Rye.  Yeah.  Not a good sign.  And Lisa's quote for Sean Lennon as he looks for a girlfriend, I can't name any of Sean's  songs off the top of my head, but that might be refreshing.  But he could rest a beer on top of mine as I suck his cock.  That's what he wants to hear.  She really thinks she's going to be the girl who's like, hey, man, I don't know who you  are, but I'll still answer and add in the paper anonymously?  Stop trying to be aloof, stupid.  You're sending him your picture and fucking including your IQ. 
[00:49:00]  That's how Yoko did it.  I saw, um.  Told John she didn't know who the Beatles were.  That's bullshit.  I know.  I saw Sean Lennon open up for the Strokes in Central Park about a year ago, a year and  a half ago.  And the guy has unbelievable talent, but he's got to get away from that, Yoko.  She's ruining his career.  This guy could put out some great music if he wasn't influenced by her ridiculous art.  Two generations of destroying music.  Isn't that wonderful?  She scream?  His voice is amazing and at times sounds exactly like John Lennon. 
[00:49:30]  Really?  So you hear the potential and the structures of the songs are pretty good and all that.  And then it's just a mess.  Just a mess.  Musically.  It's that Yoko just squirming and all over the place.  That was groovy in the 60s when you were on LSD.  Who enjoys her?  I've never met one person that thought she was a talented, good singer.  I've never met one person that goes, fucking Yoko, man.  What did she put out a CD? 
[00:50:00]  Never.  She's not talented.  Hey, there's Alexandra Jaxtus, 31, but feels like she's in her 20s.  She's 31.  She's out.  Of course you feel like you're in your 20s.  She doesn't fit his criteria.  Likes music, theater, and dogs.  Attitude reserved, yet wild and fabulous, humble and funny.  Good performances give me the ultimate high, she says.  Wow, there's two more real fast.  Cinnamon Ray, 25.  IQ, no idea.  Perfect.  Profession club promoter. 
[00:50:30]  Likes chicken fried steak, dislikes sweaty hands.  Her quote, you don't know me, but you want to.  Ooh, she's sassy.  She's a dirty girl.  And then there's Natalie Wisney Whiskey.  No shot, you Pollock.  21, 5'4", 125 pounds.  No shot.  Profession, head of international shipping for a Milwaukee company.  Ugh.  Ugh.  She loads trucks for old Milwaukee.  Yeah.  Likes the Beatles. 
[00:51:00]  John specifically dislikes Paul.  Oh, that's perfect.  Playing right into the mama's hands.  And then the quote, they'd make a great couple.  Mm-hmm.  And that's a quote from Natalie's mom.  So we want to do the same thing with Jim Norton?  Yeah, and Steve is actually really, I think the MySpace account's the best idea because I can get pictures immediately.  Yeah.  And I can save all responses.  And then you bring in the really good ones on Monday and Tuesday?  Of course.  But there's some really, Steve said maybe I can make an email address to you at Foundry.  But the names are really good that he came up with all the cuff. 
[00:51:30]  There's a datejim at foundrymusic.com or gethiv at foundrymusic.com or trannylover, L-U-V-R.  Yeah, that's practical, L-U-V-R.  Why not L-O-V-E-R?  Why just spell it L-U-V-R?  Because it was probably taken by someone else over at Foundry.  No, we'll just do jimnortonatmyspace.com.  Yes.  And I need more friends.  All right.  Yeah, see, this is a good way for him to get more friends.  And you're welcome, by the way.  The people that have gotten their checks have thanked me. 
[00:52:00]  You're not sending money to anyone.  Shut up.  You've got to be over $10,000 now, right?  Very close.  I think I am, but it's been a few days since I did it.  I'm close to $10,000.  They're very close to $10,000.  Both of you guys are close to $10,000.  We're very close to each other, as we should be.  Just two men close.  We'll see if we can find you a real girlfriend there, Jimmy.  A lovely girlfriend who would like to go on dates and handhold and do a little look at this in the cheek.  And do just like the Sean Leonard thing.  You know, what you look like, a picture, obviously, your likes, dislikes, and a quote or something.  And your insides, irrelevant to me. 
[00:52:30]  I don't care if you've had an emotional hysterectomy.  Just look good on the outside.  You really do want a girlfriend?  I don't know.  Yeah.  In a way, I would.  But you'd have to be, you know.  You're not lonely when, like, the hooker leaves?  Yeah.  You know, and you're alone in that apartment of yours.  Yeah.  Crib, I call it.  Crib.  It is your place.  Co-op, whatever you want to call it.  Pet.  All right.  One more real highlight of 2005 before we take a break. 
[00:53:00]  Inbred from Pennsylvania.  Inbred.  Yo.  Hey.  Highlight of 2005.  Apparently, every time Max from Dallas calls the show.  Yeah.  All right.  I get it.  I'm an ass.  All right.  Here's the deal.  This is what's happening, okay?  Tomorrow, we take the day off.  For the new listeners, especially, for the people just turning on their XM satellite radios,  we put together a 12-hour Best Bits Since Coming to Satellite Radio Show. 
[00:53:30]  We ran it last weekend.  We're going to run it this weekend as well, starting Friday at midnight.  For the new people.  For the new people.  Here's the very interesting thing.  We're taking tomorrow off.  There was a bunch of bits we couldn't fit in because of time restraints.  Yep.  So tomorrow's show is going to be four hours of stuff that should have made that special.  We're doing you a favor.  By taking the day off.  Does that make sense to everybody?  Yeah.  So it's more of the Best Bits Since Coming to Satellite Radio tomorrow that most people  haven't heard yet.  And then we rerun the big special all weekend long.  Great way to catch up if you're a new listener. 
[00:54:00]  It's a 12-hour show that just repeats all weekend long, okay?  Fantastic.  So that's what's going on.  And we have Drew Boogie in the studio kind of mixing and fucking around with us today.  The day before we take the long weekend.  So, Drew, why don't you kick it up here?  We'll be right back. 
[00:54:30]  Tell him, Fred!  Tell him, Fred!  Fred!  Fred!  Tell him, Fred!  Tell him, Fred!  Fred!  Fred! 
[00:55:00]  Fred!  I invented everything!  XM202  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now! 
[00:55:30]  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  Here comes up, ready and now!  We'll be right back. 
[00:56:00]  Come on, give it up to Grubo Gay.  Wow.  Mixed it live in studio today.  That is fantastic.  That rocks.  He's mixing vomit. 
[00:56:30]  It's great.  Absolutely love it.  Hi, Sam.  That one could be as good as the hybrid car sound one you do.  Maybe you'll have to do that to break.  For the people that haven't heard that one yet, but Drew Boogie in studio, yes, doing a great job.  How many guys can mix in the sounds of vomit like that and make it completely work?  I dare anybody.  Oh, sorry.  Go again.  I challenge anybody to come and do that.  Absolutely not. 
[00:57:00]  I'm bringing up challenges.  Fuck it.  Mix wars.  I can't see anybody else making sense of vomit like you do.  That's fantastic.  It's a beautiful thing.  It wasn't a backhanded compliment either, my friend.  Thank you.  My thought is the truckers out there, do they get it on any level?  Oh, yeah.  In the south, they're just driving around.  They enjoy the tune and the vomit.  You should do a little country mix sometime down the road.  Oh, I'm going to really fuck them up.  I'm going to do some hip-hop mix later and really drive them away today.  That's all right. 
[00:57:30]  We can handle that.  Let's go to Lil' Connor who's on the line.  We're looking for some of the real highlights of 2005.  Lil' Connor, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks, Connor.  Hey, wasn't Ben's hog pretty big in 2005?  Yes, it certainly was.  And four in 2003.  When was he born?  Incidentally, that's another highlight that people are missing.  It was a big part of this year.  What?  My birthday.  Yeah, your birthday.  I'm sure it's today.  I don't expect people to get all crazy about it. 
[00:58:00]  No.  No.  You had birthdays like a progeria kid should have birthdays this year.  Every day is another year.  Go ahead.  How old are you?  Well, how do you mean that?  Do you mean theoretically or?  87.  Greg in Ohio.  Greg?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Happy birthday, Lil' Tim.  What?  Hey, a highlight for you.  First Fox Snuff film. 
[00:58:30]  The what?  The horse fuck snuff film.  Oh, horse fuck snuff film.  Yeah, the guy that was having sex with the horse and the horse drove it home and messed up his insides.  Killed the guy.  What was that? 
[00:59:00]  That's a girl getting nailed by a horse, right?  Yeah, well, the story was that farm in Seattle or outside Seattle, somewhere there in Washington State.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And guys mostly paid to have sex with animals on this farm. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, and some guy was having sex with a horse.  And he died, right?  Yeah.  He died.  The horse put a little bit in.  And I guess they have handlers there that are supposed to keep it that way.  But that horse wanted nothing of that.  He wanted to bury it.  Yeah, and he did.  He certainly did.  Can't blame the horse.  Quite a little bottom like that.  How do you not?  Let's go to Knuckle Fart.  Knuckle Fart.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, Drew, you got a mixtape out or anything that we can pick up? 
[01:00:00]  Not yet.  I'm working on something, though.  You really should.  You know how many of those we could sell for you?  Even if you just did the remixes really quick through 10 or 12 on a CD?  I have a better idea, actually.  Uh-oh.  But I'm not going to divulge it on the air.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Secrets.  Oh, that's smart.  I know what the idea is.  What?  It's to give these away for free at my Tower Theater.  Oh, Tower.  Yeah.  You should not be allowed to finish that plug right now.  Tower.  Sure.  Jimmy, I'll look at you again in an hour. 
[01:00:30]  That was just...  I really am a cocksucker.  Pug-leater.  Jeez.  That's hard.  Pug-leater.  Yes, sir.  Just a little quick update, buddy.  I went on to your one sponsor, Fodog.net, and it is an excellent site.  I emailed...  I think his name is Mr. Ayer.  Yes.  And immediately wrote me right back and thanked me for writing to him.  I told him I heard it on your show and everything.  They're very nice people, and that is one hell of a site. 
[01:01:00]  Keep up the good work.  Bodog.net to learn how to play poker.  Yes.  B-O-D-O-G.net.  Yeah.  Learn everything you need to know.  Anthony checks it out on a weekly basis.  I'm on there.  I'll talk.  I got a lot of computer things going on.  Looking up stuff on eBay.  Guns that he may need for his collection.  His growing collection.  It's very nice.  Huh?  All right.  Whatever there.  I don't know what he said at the end.  Found a nice rifle sight for my Enfield.  I was doing a little research on it. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Seeing, you know, where it came from, when, when it was built.  I got the serial numbers.  Everything matches, which is good.  A lot of times you get the bolt and receivers don't match up, but everything matches.  My brother did a great job.  All right.  The hot tech of 06, 2006.  This is some of the stuff we can look forward to.  Yes.  Let's go to this clip.  Is there one device, is there one form of technology that's going to have the most impact this year?  Well, in the last few years, we've seen broadband internet to the home as a really big trend. 
[01:02:00]  And I think in 2006 and beyond, the really big trend, the thing that's really going to have a major impact on our lives, is broadband wireless.  So you're seeing technologies like Wi-Fi, which are in homes or in offices, really being deployed across cities.  So cities like Philadelphia, San Francisco, are being lit up in what are called mesh networks, where you get broadband wireless internet, you know, to your laptop, to your phone, but throughout the city.  And there are even other technologies, like Verizon has a broadband wireless that uses a cellular network that's called Edge or EVDO. 
[01:02:30]  Those are others that allow you basically to get really high-speed internet on the go.  That's great.  You think 2006 will be the year of Wi-Fi?  Yeah.  It's been kind of popping up here and there, but it looks like it's really going to explode in 2006.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, all the big cities will have it at first, and then, yeah, it'll be all over the place.  That way, you're with your laptop.  You don't have to find a connection anywhere you are.  Boom.  Open it up.  You're online.  How about planes?  That'd be nice to finally have internet on the planes. 
[01:03:00]  It'll crash.  Oh, yeah.  You insane?  I don't know.  Turn off all those devices when they're in the air.  It's amazing.  It doesn't interfere.  It does nothing.  No.  Because that's true.  The terrorists would just get out on a little laptop and open it up.  It doesn't interfere with anything.  Guarantee that was just a room full of people like flight attendants and other people that work in the cabin saying, look, we just don't want to listen to that shit for fucking hours on end.  Because they're talking about letting people use their cell phones during flights. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, they just want everyone to pay attention.  Just don't be tough.  When it's time to land and when it's time to take off.  That's all that's about.  You don't want the guy talking loudly.  I hate it on trains, down the sidewalk, it annoys me.  I don't think anyone's ever heard a conversation I've had on a cell phone.  You keep it at a normal level.  I'm embarrassed when I have to use my cell phone on a train.  But some people, yeah.  The guy that hovers into the window, like I turn sideways and then I cut my hands like, yeah, yeah, I'm on the train. 
[01:04:00]  No, yeah, yeah, I'll...  Keep it quick.  Yeah, I'll be getting it in an hour.  Yeah, I'm going through that file right now.  Let me open up my briefcase.  The guy's office is now the seat next to you.  Nah, shut up.  You should be able to take out a hammer and just hit him over the head once.  Nice and hard.  Great.  Press the cheek.  Oof.  It's unbelievable that people are just not shy with their phones on the trains and the planes and stuff.  Annoying, and that's what you'd need on a fucking plane.  But with the plane thing, if it was really a danger, don't you think they would collect them all? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Seriously.  They're just going to leave it up to you that you're turning it off?  Right.  People don't do it in a fucking movie theater when the worst thing that's going to happen is you're going to miss what's said on the screen.  What about some stupid rube that wasn't listening and just happens to turn the cell phone on in the middle of the flight?  What danger is there really?  Dude.  If it was a danger, they would be collecting it into a big box and saying, hey, we'll give  it back at the end of the flight.  Nothing happens.  Stop.  Cell phones at the gas pump.  Shut up. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, that don't work either.  No blowing up cars from a cell phone.  It did happen once.  It was a freak thing with some static electricity.  Yeah, but it wasn't a cell phone.  It was a static charge from touching the truck.  Oh.  Yeah.  I saw that on Mythbusters.  I think there was a ring.  One had a ring or something.  And they did it.  They actually filled a room up.  That's why I love Mythbusters.  They filled a plexiglass room up with a gas vapor and put a cell phone in it and called it, 
[01:05:30]  answered it, had it go.  Set off a spark in the room.  I mean, they really had to work to make this blow up.  I don't know.  I think that's one of those things.  Myth, as they say on Mythbusters.  There you go.  All right.  Cell phones in 2006.  Everyone wants to know.  Yeah.  Should they get a new cell phone?  Should they wait?  It's a game you can never win, obviously.  No, but right now, very big video on demand.  Video on demand on the cell phone?  Yeah, that's very big on the phone.  I use it.  I was sitting there in a doctor's office waiting room. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, it just takes forever.  You sit there and wait, what are you, an hour?  And what are you going to do?  Read the magazines?  Talk to the wonderful people that are in there?  No.  I pulled out my phone.  It popped up.  And now every week it seems like they're adding more channels to it.  I was watching Discovery Channel live on my telephone.  Then Fox News.  You can watch MTV.  And then they keep adding new shows. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  To that whole package.  It's all about the MP3 players, too, with the phones.  That's the new thing as well.  Download the music right to your phone.  Well, let's see what they have to say about the phones in 2006.  Well, if you're a power user, you love all the new features and functions coming into cell phones.  But most folks, I think, are a little intimidated by all of the additional features.  So two phones that are examples of kind of what's to come are the Motorola Pebble here and the Motorola Silver.  This is, you know, the sort of similar form factor to the Razer, which is popular. 
[01:07:00]  The Razer, right.  And what they've got in these phones, what you're seeing with, like, lots of phones, is just more and more features being added.  So, for example, these both have MPEG-4 video capture and playback so you can show video on them.  They've got something called Screen 3, which is a push technology that delivers news and entertainment to the phone without zero clicks.  So you've got a lot of things like that, but also, you know, really what you've got is a convergence of cell phones and computers.  So people doing e-mail, you know, watching videos.  There is a term mobisode, which is like a mobile episode of watching video on your cell phone. 
[01:07:30]  People using phones to swipe credit cards, you know, use GPS technology.  So it's really more and more functions being embedded in the phone.  Question.  Do these actually make phone calls?  They do make phone calls.  It doesn't drop three times.  Oh, my God.  Make phone calls.  I was getting some big laughs at the Christmas party because what I was doing, everyone had digital cameras, and I was picking that up and talking into it. 
[01:08:00]  Hello?  Yeah, just making a call on my camera.  See, because a lot of people now are taking pictures with the phone.  I'd have seen that.  I know what I've been able to do.  I know, Jimmy.  And all I can think of is you when you put your glasses on upside down and the room just loses their mind.  For those on PalTalk, I know you can't see this at home, but you know what?  You're missing out on some big laughs.  I walk in like this, the whole place goes crazy.  It's upside down.  Look at that.  Upside down.  His glasses were upside down. 
[01:08:30]  Unbelievable.  And it's a scream, people.  Does he know it?  Does he not know it?  The mystery continues.  That's why we're brilliant broadcasters.  Of course.  I've got to keep repeating that one.  And by the way, I was watching the commercial.  Can I say it for the country?  Enough with fucking Queen Latifah.  Enough with this fucking woman.  But Jimmy, she's so sassy.  Oh.  And she's just full of energy.  And she'll, you don't get one past her.  Let me tell you.  But you know, she's got the safe energy.  She's got the sassy black gal thing, but she's not threatening at all. 
[01:09:00]  And she kind of puts her hair the way we like it.  That's why she's in every movie.  Oh.  Oh.  You're not enjoying her?  No.  I have not seen one movie she has been in.  Well, the cab movie with Jimmy Fallon, I didn't watch.  No.  But, uh...  I refuse to watch that.  Jimmy Fallon's career just taken off after leaving SNL.  A lot of those SNL guys have problems with the movies except Will Ferrell.  There's only a couple.  Will Ferrell's in every movie, though.  I would say, well, yeah, but he's at least having a successful career. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, did he say, but Will Ferrell, or...  Oh, yeah, but he's doing great.  He's had a few bombs, but...  He's had bombs, but they continue to give him roles.  All of them that have gone on to do films have had their share of bombs.  Yeah.  But there are the guys that just can get through it, and they make other films, and that's it.  Someone's calling me.  Who would call such a star of your magnitude on the radio?  Why would someone call me?  Ahem.  Let me answer.  It's from Virginia.  Ooh. 
[01:10:00]  Hello?  Hello?  This is Anthony.  Who are you?  You're calling from Geico.  Geico sure knows how to interrupt my radio show.  You certainly do.  Every time you talk to me before.  Yeah.  It's between 7 and 11.  Am I getting money?  I heard...  Maybe. 
[01:10:30]  Maybe.  Maybe.  I did.  I got my $500 deductible back, everybody, because I'm a fancy man.  They never saw you drinking and driving, did they?  Yeah.  I drink and drive a lot.  You might want to add that to the insurance.  All right.  One quick question.  Maybe...  Ah, quick question.  We're doing a national talk show, you bitch!  Holy shit, you fucking...  Could I call you back, um, later?  Did she say one quick question?  When, uh...  He's on the radio, stupid! 
[01:11:00]  He's on the radio, you whore!  It's what?  You're a puppy!  Guy!  Guy!  Guy, you whore!  Guy in a car crash, you whore!  That's fantastic.  The Geico lizard has AIDS.  She did not say one quick question after you said you're in the middle of doing a talk  show.  Yes.  That's like...  Ugh.  I'm...  I hate you all.  I'm on the air.  And she's asked me if I...  One quick question.  That would only be acceptable if the question was, why am I such a dumb cunt? 
[01:11:30]  That's what...  And the question was, if I used a rental car during that period.  That's not a quick question, because now I have to tell her what rental agency, how  much, all the...  Typical fuck that answers the phones, has no concept of anything going on outside their  office.  One quick question.  I'm on...  I'm on...  How about this?  No, bitch.  I'm on the air.  I'm really tough with your insurance people. 
[01:12:00]  Geico.  Ramon.  Ramon!  You should ban Geico from your life.  Just drive around without car insurance.  Yes.  That's what I would do.  Like the Puerto Ricans.  That's right.  You get hit by a Puerto Rican, just write it off.  Just...  Just fucking write it off.  You will not see an insurance card in there.  Just go to Starbucks and start crying.  That's all.  Just...  You ain't seeing dime one.  Sir, do you have insurance?  I didn't think you did.  Insurance?  Of course you don't. 
[01:12:30]  You don't have insurance.  I'll get back in the car.  Let Uncle Ted take over.  Thank you very much.  All right.  We know, Ted.  We're a real American and we're not.  You're going to help us all out, Ted.  We get it.  Yes.  Build a wall at the border.  I understand.  Al, that's what Sharpton said.  Don't do this.  You sit back.  I'll put my feet up.  I'm Uncle Ted.  I'll take you...  All right.  We know.  Guns are good and we're all commie fags.  We get it, Ted.  God, I hope someone's laughing out there because that is Ted Nugent.  Of course.  To a key.  Every time he's on our show.  He's great.  He gives us good radio, but...  We get with the catchphrases. 
[01:13:00]  We get it.  We're stupid and you know all.  Yeah.  And Saddam Hussein.  All right.  The name's kind of like Saddam, but it's Saddam.  Wow.  Saddam Hussein.  Right, I guess.  Hey, getting back to cell phones really fast.  Conan O'Brien had an unbelievable observation about cell phones.  Yes.  He talks about cell phones and how the technology takes you out of old movies where you can't  even watch some of these old movies anymore because the cell phones are so gigantic.  Yeah.  And he brought up an example and it really pissed me off if it wasn't something that 
[01:13:30]  we thought of, you know, these obvious things.  He was watching Wall Street.  Yes.  Yeah.  And Michael Douglas is in the Hamptons on the beach and talking about how like money's  good and greed's good and all this.  And he had like this massive fucking, you have to use two hands to use a cell phone.  And you're talking on the beach.  And it takes you right out of the movie because, you know, obviously the phones are beyond  small at this point.  What a brilliant observation from Conan O'Brien, who's still doing edgy, edgy topical humor 
[01:14:00]  like Mr. Letterman.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  I wouldn't want that triumph on my bad side.  Oh, he lets you have it.  Well, I'm going to poop on you.  Get away from me, you.  Don't poop on me.  I give up.  I give up.  You're a man who talks through a puppet.  The next time you watch an old movie, though, you know, watch for the old cell phone.  Yes.  Gone with the wind.  Gone with the wind.  Well, yeah, sure.  Well, that one.  That wasn't a cell phone.  They would just punch a black person and say, now go give that message. 
[01:14:30]  All right.  More, uh...  Oh, that would have been hysterical.  What happened, sweetie?  It wasn't out.  What happened?  Who didn't put that out?  My phone bullhorn wasn't out.  There's plenty of time.  I was going to do a whole, you know, frankly...  Oh, look at him.  He's losing his mind.  See what happens?  The Jews did it.  The Jews did it.  Quick, put on your costume.  Now this is what you get.  Now look what I do. 
[01:15:00]  Now look what I do.  Hawk.  Where's your chicken?  You haven't used your new chicken toy.  He's got a new chicken toy.  He's a fucking lunatic.  Yeah.  Lycan.  Lycan chicken.  Lycan.  Yeah, yeah, good.  Good.  Lycan.  Lycan does chicken.  Yeah, you're a chicken fucker.  Yeah.  Nothing's turning into like a Nazi caratop.  He's got all his fucking... 
[01:15:30]  Nazi caratop.  He's got his fucking whacked out bells and whistles and fucking noisemakers over there.  He's like Gallagher, but he picks up a thing and he smashes out gold teeth instead of a watermelon.  I expect Anthony to come in here as the one-man band soon.  Just walks in with the bass drum on my back.  Cymbals inside his knees.  Why not?  Where are we?  All right.  So, more tech talk for 2006, Anthony.  Uh-huh. 
[01:16:00]  Yes, video on demand they talk about here.  Well, we've talked in the past about, you know, football widows.  Now you're going to have video on demand widows.  So that, you know, there's so much good video content that's available now to an iPod, to, you know, over cable, to your devices like TiVo or your computer.  There's all of this kind of instant access, really top-notch television programming that it may begin to have some ripple effects where people spend a little bit less time in their relationships and a little more time watching TV. 
[01:16:30]  I've got to tell you, this DVR has taken over my world.  I just tape everything.  And then when I have, like, a slow day like yesterday, I was tired and didn't feel like doing anything.  I spent three hours in front of the TV going through.  Going through, well, you do the marathon thing, but I jump around.  Like, all of a sudden, Conan O'Brien had our friend Mark Maron on.  So I watched his set with Conan.  It was great.  Then I went to David Letterman.  He had Andy Kindler, who's a pretty funny dude.  I like Andy, man.  He's, like, really fucking bombs a lot because he's really out there.  He's very funny. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, very sarcastic and dry.  You don't have to sit through all the rest of the shit of the show, though.  I even look at the, yeah, who was on each show.  Like, oh, Jack Black.  Well, I saw Kong.  Let me see what he had to say about the movie.  I just jump around.  I make my own fucking programming real fast.  Yeah, you don't have to watch the entire show anymore.  You can watch it whenever you want.  I can't get enough of this DVR.  That's what we're coming to.  You know what I did?  My problem with TiVo, I had the same thing, but I wound up saving so much, I keep running  out of room on it, and I don't watch anything.  You don't watch anything?  Nah, so I'm like, I can just save it.  And all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, yeah, that's eight months ago. 
[01:17:30]  I should watch it.  You have to watch it.  I don't save anything.  I just let it go away on its own, and, you know, I'll catch up and go to the bottom.  You know what I mean?  And then work it forward, and it's unbelievable.  I can't.  When I have to sit there and watch a show and sit through commercials, I can't imagine.  I like it for the few reality shows that were pretty fun to watch.  You just record them all.  Don't watch one fucking episode.  And then one lazy Sunday.  And then one day, boom, you watch the entire thing. 
[01:18:00]  And you can fast forward through every commercial.  You can fast forward through the recaps.  So the entire series only takes a few hours to actually sit down and watch the meat of it.  You know, if commercials were funny and interesting that they are in England and Europe, people  would watch them.  But there's such faggoty nonsense that you can't do anything edgy, anything really ballsy.  That's why people go right through them.  People then protest, and the companies buckle under because they're afraid.  Right.  Yeah, so you get nothing.  It was like if I was reading this stupid New York radio message board, and they're talking 
[01:18:30]  about how satellite radio and other mediums are cutting into regular radio because apparently  this is the worst financial year radio has had.  Regular radio.  Regular radio in history.  Ever.  We had a little something to do with that.  We had a little something to do with that.  No, no.  Not according to anybody on that fucking board.  Of course not.  Oh, fuck themselves.  They are still laughing at things like satellite radio, at things like the iPod, any other type 
[01:19:00]  of downloadable medium for your phones, gaming systems, the portable, the PSP.  Think about it.  Let's say you're on a trip going with your fucking kids.  You're in the car going somewhere.  Your kids are now playing PSP in the back seat instead of listening.  You know, I want to listen to any PLJ or something.  Right, right.  You know, they're now playing video games. 
[01:19:30]  That is cutting in on radio listenership.  The ratings aren't as high.  The revenue for commercials aren't as high.  They lose money.  And they're wondering why this year was the worst, as far as radio revenue goes, ever  in radio history.  The worst year they've ever had.  And there were a few posts that made sense.  Some that were saying things like, there's so many other options out there.  Satellite radio.  Gaming systems.  iPods.  Other ways to get your entertainment in your car, walking, jogging at your home. 
[01:20:00]  But people consistently answer back to these threads like,  no, radio's been there.  It's always going to be there.  And it has nothing to do with it.  It'll always be there.  180 million listeners.  Satellites only got this many million.  And games.  What is that going to do to radio?  Just keep saying it.  Keep saying it.  They're out of touch.  And it's a lot of that same mentality.  You're the problem.  On the New York Radio Message Board, a lot of them are so out of touch with anything that's 
[01:20:30]  not fucking some half-DJ bullshit.  Yeah, no, it's not to be a satellite radio.  It's not.  Alan Snippen really bugs me, even though he's a smart dentist.  Alan has dropped the ball as far as his...  He's very knowledgeable as far as old-school radio goes.  As far as new stuff, he's the guy that runs the New York Radio Message Board.  We have a relationship with the guy.  He's a nice enough guy and everything.  But he really is not up on this new technology, satellite radio, and other forms of entertainment 
[01:21:00]  that used to only be available to you through radio.  These aren't little things.  These aren't fads.  They aren't going away.  They're growing so quickly that they are taking listeners away from free radio, as they  like to call it.  And they've got to stop saying satellite radio, and we have to stop saying satellite radio  eventually, because this is so much more than radio, traditional radio, what XM is doing.  You know, you can't compare this to regular radio.  And that's what they're trying to do. 
[01:21:30]  It's actually bad to just call this radio.  I really think XM has to come up with a whole new slogan, satellite radio and more, satellite  radio entertainment.  Satellite entertainment.  Because there's just so much that satellite gives you that you just can't and will not  get on your regular radio channels there.  And they've done it to themselves, not just by censoring and buckling to the FCC, but by  being such fucking run-of-the-mill jingle faggots.  You all do the same thing with your phony fucking voices, and you stink, and people are tired 
[01:22:00]  of it.  Well, what happened, because I've been around a while, and I'm just throwing a little of my  knowledge on the table here.  There was a point in radio where programming ruled the station.  It was all about programming, and if you want to advertise, okay, you know, yeah, we'll  squeeze in a little advertising for this or that.  Somewhere along the line, I couldn't tell you exactly when, but actually when Ant and I  were doing it, somewhere in the 90s, late 90s.  All of a sudden, it was all about advertising and programming was secondary, and that's  where it all began to change, and that's when Satellite Radio was able to, you know, 
[01:22:30]  to develop and become what it is and what it's going to become, because they gave up on  programming years ago, and now it's too late to catch up.  And they took the ads for Satellite.  That's how greedy they were.  They took the ads.  Now, dudes, I asked Iran, I don't think he has it today, there was a rant when Anthony  and I was on WNAW.  We had to do XM Satellite Radio ads, and people have called us out on that, and I openly admit  it.  When we were doing commercial radio, we had to play the XM spots, and everyone was like, 
[01:23:00]  ah, it's no big deal.  XM is nothing.  Oh, yeah.  We're pretty much taking their money.  They're giving us a boatload of money to advertise their service.  It's like IATA, like that internet radio, don't worry about it.  And I was like, fuck that.  I talked over the entire spot, and Anthony and I went on like a 10-minute rant why this  is not good for regular radio.  I would love to replay that maybe next week.  I remember on the show one time, you sighed, you went, this is the competition!  Yeah.  And you smashed the console because you had to read that live read. 
[01:23:30]  I remember that.  But the greed, they took it because they're like, eh, why aren't they still taking the ads?  Yeah, they're not taking them out.  Why aren't they still just, hey, take the ads, go ahead.  Well, now they're doing the anti-ads.  They're not a threat.  Satellite radio's not a threat, but we don't want to take the ads.  Why are they pushing to have satellite regulated if it's not a threat?  Ah, not a threat, but we just want to do that.  But that goes to the point I was making.  It got so bad with the advertising over-programming thing that they started accepting ads for the 
[01:24:00]  competition because it was all about making as much money right there instead of getting  some good programming on the air first and then try to get revenue in.  And it's such unlistenable shit.  Like, if I listen to the 70s or 80s channel or whatever on here, I cannot listen to regular  radio.  They fucking talk over the beginning of the song.  Shut your fucking mouth.  They have to reinvent themselves.  And the people that are talented enough to do that have left years ago, years ago to  go into some kind of other entertainment business, into satellite radio. 
[01:24:30]  The people left in commercial radio, they stink.  Here's how out of touch they are, too, over there, traditional radio guys over on the New  York radio message board.  They talk about how it's a jukebox.  Like, there's no feel of anything.  If you go to the decades channels, the 60s, 70s, 80s, there are jocks on there that are  giving you, like, when I listen to the 60s channel sometimes, you feel like you're back 
[01:25:00]  in the backseat of the Rambler with dad driving.  Like, there's jocks that sound like the old 60s jocks.  They play old jingles from the time period, commercials.  They talk about things that are going on in the news in, like, 1963, and then, boom,  they're into a 60s song.  Same thing with the 70s.  They're giving you, like, that kind of info where it's almost like a fucking audio time  machine that you're listening to while you're driving.  You're not getting that, and you weren't getting that from CBS FM, the oldies station that was 
[01:25:30]  here in New York that changed format.  They have no clue what it's about.  Alan is one of the most guilty motherfuckers over there, Alan Sniffen.  He doesn't have satellite radio.  He doesn't listen to it, yet he comments on it constantly and bashes it.  And by the way, yes, it does sound like a jukebox, you dumb motherfuckers.  That's what a radio should be.  It's a jukebox in your car.  You don't want to hear the guy talking over the beginning of the song so you can't tape 
[01:26:00]  it and enjoy it later.  It's supposed to be like a jukebox.  And XM is going to hit, I guess, $6 million any day now.  Yes.  Right?  And just to give the people out there a taste of reality, Anthony and I and Jim Norton came  to XM.  Ten people.  It was like a little over two.  Could have been a couple of more than that, Jimmy.  Yeah, about two.  About two.  By the time I think we started our first broadcast, there was like 2.2 million subscribers, give  or take. 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  Joe Shareholder, you know, don't make my numbers.  I'm misrepresenting the numbers again.  Shut up, Dick.  Give or take, it was about 2.2 when we did our first show at XM, I believe.  Okay?  Just a mere year and three months later, now we're going to be at $6 million any day.  $6 million.  Any day.  What do you think?  And it just goes from there.  What do you think?  That's going to stop car deals?  That growth is just going to stop dead in its tracks.  No one else is going to get it.  As it gets easier to get, as it is put in more cars that people are buying, that number 
[01:27:00]  is going to go down?  Right.  They're insane.  They don't know what they're talking about.  And now they're running the anti-satellite radio ads.  Have you heard these yet, or were you in Hollywood?  Oh, my God.  We had like two hours of fun with these.  I've not heard them.  Listen to how unimaginable and uncreative they are now with this fight that they have on their  hands.  They had to come up with anti-satellite radio commercials.  This is the best they could do.  We have no problem playing them.  Two outlasts in the ninth.  Bases loaded. 
[01:27:30]  Here's Santos.  He's 0 for 4 today.  2.69 hitter for the year.  We could be going into extra innings here.  I agree.  Here's the pitch to Santos.  Fastball hit in the air.  Deep down the left field line.  It's headed toward the pole.  That ball is...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some  things were just meant to be free.  Wow. 
[01:28:00]  Can you believe the desperation there?  They had this whole campaign against satellite radio and they're using old technology to  fight it just like their old ways on commercial radio.  Who the fuck uses a payphone at this day and age?  Sorry.  No, no, no.  I'm saying who the fuck talks like that?  Right.  And why don't they show you something else about satellite radio?  Like when that home run is hit and it's a foul ball and they go to commercial.  Yeah.  They make you want XM and flip to any other game in the fucking country.  I know.  Instead of listening to the same shit that you've been stuck listening to. 
[01:28:30]  They picked one of the worst examples ever, a baseball game.  Fucking assholes.  Where you're going to get the entire game, no matter what city you're in, you could listen  to your team.  Isn't that amazing?  What dopes.  What dopes.  Way to be relatable to the people you're trying to hit by using payphone technology in your  spot.  25 cents for the next three minutes.  Three minutes.  Yeah.  We'll figure that out.  I think it's a little cheaper than that.  Shocking news in the world of heavy metal.  One of the hardest bands on the planet is about to release a children's record. 
[01:29:00]  Songs slated to appear on the album include A Tisket A Tasket, Hey Diddle Diddle, and  The Hokey Pokey.  Let's listen to a sneak preview.  Here's Rear on the Rosie performed by the one and only...  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes.  Radio.  You shouldn't have to pay for it.  You shouldn't have to.  This message brought to you by America's 13,000 local radio stations who believe some  things were just meant to be free.  At least he says you shouldn't have to pay for it, but you do. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You shouldn't have to.  We understand that.  But we did such a horrible job, you do have to pay for it.  But, yeah, you do have to because we stink on ice.  That's right.  And they get a guy in the phoniest radio voice.  Yeah.  That's right.  Radio.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Radio.  Put a corner into Robert Reed's asshole.  Ramone.  Oh, give me the next 20 minutes of commercial.  Ramone, ring around the Rosie jokes are never funny.  Ramone, where's my two for Tuesday? 
[01:30:00]  Ramone, talk over the beginning of the song.  Ramone.  Ramone.  Alan's sniffing as a tooth fixing jizz bucket.  Ramone, bring me my get the lead out.  Ramone, thank you, Kevin H. Seeley.  Ramone.  Ramone, it's Alan sniffing. 
[01:30:30]  Ramone, stairway to heaven's going to be number one again.  Ramone, Mel Carmisen ruined radio.  Ramone, bring me the firecracker 500.  Ramone, Mel Carmisen didn't have the balls to stick up for Opie and Anthony.  You cock.  You fucking cock. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, you're real brave in the boardroom.  Oh, fucking asshole.  Ramone, the Jersey guys have a funny echo.  Radio stocks.  Ramone, bring me my echo.  I got to talk about this Holly song.  Fuck.  Ramone, get drunk and throw a female DJ out of the studio. 
[01:31:30]  Ramone, RuPaul has man hands.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing a lewd act.  Gee, what's going to happen?  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal. 
[01:32:00]  This is the best commercial.  They're trying to do an anti-satellite radio commercial, and they played right into our hands with this commercial right here.  Yeah, listen to what she just said.  Listen closely to what she said.  In music news, you'll never believe who was arrested on stage last night for performing a lewd act.  It was so outrageous, we can't even describe it on the radio.  You might expect this behavior from heavy metal or rap stars,  but this time, the guilty party is none other than the easy listening sensation.  Please deposit 25 cents for the next three minutes. 
[01:32:30]  Radio, you shouldn't have to pay for it.  This message brought to you by America's 13th and local radio stations who believe something.  Not only will we tell you the lewd act, if we have audio, we'll play it.  Yeah.  I actually hear that voice in my head, and instead of radio, it says pussy.  Do you know what she did wrong here?  If you play the beginning, how about, let's just say you fucking whore,  instead of teasing it, because you have to keep people listening,  how about if you just said the name of the person, the three minutes wouldn't have run out?  Yeah.  Like, Iggy Pop was arrested today. 
[01:33:00]  You'll never guess.  Why should we have to?  You have it in front of you.  We can't even describe it on the radio.  Boo-doo-doo.  25 cents.  Okay, I'll pay.  Yeah, a guy went on stage, pulled his cock out, and shoved it up this chick's ass.  That's right.  There you go.  That's what you get from satellite radio.  No tease, no nothing.  You can listen to whatever you want here.  I got to tell you one thing about coming to satellite radio.  I am so glad I don't have to spend half my fucking time on commercial radio setting shit up  and teasing shit to make you listen longer.  We barely give you a tease. 
[01:33:30]  We barely do it.  If it's something really big and we want to make sure you're around, we'll go,  oh my god, Jimmy's got some unbelievable announcement after this break.  Really quick.  But man, commercial radio, we would tease something all afternoon long  and finally play it the last five minutes of the show just to make sure people were listening longer  through those god-awful commercial breaks that went on forever.  What a doodle, bone dry, yeah.  They really are out of touch if that's the best thing.  None of those are funny.  It's so lewd that we can't even tell you. 
[01:34:00]  Played right into satellite radio.  Yeah, satellite can tell you.  It's not like you can play the audio.  That's the beauty of it.  Right.  Ramon, lick Betsy's tits.  How fucking great was that?  Yeah, we were playing that for a week.  Oh, fantastic, the Pat O'Brien audio.  Absolutely.  Did that make the countdown that's going to run this weekend, the Pat O'Brien stuff?  It did make it?  All right, good.  We're doing the best bits since coming to satellite radio all weekend long on this channel.  And tomorrow, we're taking the day off.  It's all the bits that we didn't have time to fit into the huge special we put together. 
[01:34:30]  So tomorrow and Saturday and Sunday are going to be some great radio on 202.  Should we take a break?  Pat in Boston, what's up?  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Ramon!  Nothing.  Oh, that was a radio sound?  Oh, the pew, pew, pew.  Hey, I got a big enough fog.  Yeah.  That guy got his helmet scraped on TV with the fireman on the bridge. 
[01:35:00]  Again, nothing.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait.  It might be just us, though.  The guy that got the helmet scraped fire on the bridge.  Oh, wait.  I think his van knows.  Yeah, his Johnson got scraped, right?  Yeah, he was in some sort of water that was carrying him down, and he got caught on a  bridge or something.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  And they pulled him out, and his junk scraped up against the whole wall as they're pulling  him out?  Yeah, something like that.  Something like that.  Oh, he was naked?  Yeah.  He had good cheeks?  That was pretty funny.  He lost some of his penis. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  Did he really?  I don't know.  Just trying to make it sound better.  Oh, well, I'm Gary Gullible.  Really?  He's a run of a microphone.  It's got to be true.  Not like everyone's going to go look it up to see if it was accurate.  I was just giving them a little something, something.  Hey, more tech for 2006.  This is the last one.  Video blogs are going to be hot, Anthony.  Video blogs.  Explain what a blog is.  A blog is a video blog, a blog being kind of an online diary or journal where people  are posting their opinions.  Well, now people are using video on a site like rocketboom.com to do daily commentary 
[01:36:00]  and share their thoughts about what's going on in the world.  But it's not the professionals on TV.  It's folks, everyone from amateurs to more experts.  Anybody can be a broadcaster in their garage.  It's frightening.  We don't need that.  We don't need the competition.  But intriguing, exciting, and always informational.  Thank you, Omar.  I appreciate it.  I don't need the competition from some guy in his garage.  It's more entertaining to watch some of that stuff. 
[01:36:30]  It certainly is.  Get ready to get the news.  Bring in the new guard.  From some fat loads sitting in his garage than you.  Video blog, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Might have to get into that.  Yeah.  It'd be fun.  You know who did one?  It's like what Phil from Pantera did.  Yeah.  That type of thing where you just kind of, you know what I mean?  After Dimebag got shot, he did this whole thing for his website where he just kind of  talked into a video camera.  Yeah.  I guess that's what it's going to be like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know why I had to explain that like people don't understand what video log is.  You get a video camera and do you put it on the web? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  I have one.  If I could explain it even more.  I've done something like a video blog, except it looks like a hand wrapped around a cock  going up and down on a fat stomach.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We've got Drew Boogie in studio.  Play us out of here for a little bit there, Drew.  We'll be right back. 
[01:37:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:38:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[01:38:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[01:39:00]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. 
[01:39:30]  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  I love when Drew stops by.  Drew Boogie, everybody, in-house. 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  Checking out the last Opie and Anthony show for 2005.  And I'm going to tell you to see you next year.  See you next year.  Hey, hey.  See you next year.  See, because it's only a couple of days.  I can't wait to see Dick Clark.  I cannot wait to see Dick Clark.  I have a picture of him in the paper today.  Yes.  Not looking too good.  Updated picture.  Not one of those Photoshopped ones that they were promoting the New Year's Rockin' Eve with.  Yeah.  And, uh-oh, it doesn't look that good. 
[01:40:30]  Got a cane.  He's hunched over.  Something going on with, I think his left side.  I don't know what side it was.  What side looked a little saggy?  I don't know.  Does it matter?  Does it matter?  I mean, really.  Sure to him it does.  It sucks no matter what side it is.  Certainly.  Let's go to Rob in Minnesota real fast.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know what real radio is afraid to tell you.  Okay.  About satellite radio. 
[01:41:00]  All right.  One hundred thousandths of a penny for the next three minutes is what it would cost anybody  that has satellite radio.  You actually did the math.  Did the math.  Eight?  So it would hundred thousandths of a penny for the next three minutes or 25 cents for the  next eight hours.  Or actually, it's just over seven hours.  That doesn't sound right.  I don't know.  It's really cheap.  Let's just put it that way.  It's really cheap.  And now the units are coming way down. 
[01:41:30]  Thousandths of a penny.  I think when we started on satellite radio, the units were still like close to $200 a pop.  And now they're like way down there.  Giving them away.  They're pretty much giving them away.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Thank you.  All right.  Tim in St. Louis has a comment about Drew Boogie.  Tim, what's up?  Not much.  I was just saying, y'all need to have Drew Boogie on my offer, man.  He's awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he told us that he wants to cut back because he's running out of material.  He just told us that.  Like bleeding blood from a stone. 
[01:42:00]  Shit.  No.  You got the puke thing we heard.  I like the dice thing right there.  The dice gay thing was great.  That's great stuff.  And you can pull stuff out you did months ago.  All right.  Speaking of Drew Boogie, we got instant feedback from Bodog from WackBag.com.  Hey, guys.  I've been listening off and on today here at work.  Can you ask Drew Boogie when the full Tippi Tom song is coming out?  It's actually the Gray Wolf song.  And Drew was talking about that during one of the breaks. 
[01:42:30]  It's not going to happen?  It can't happen.  Now, why?  Gray Wolf is, I don't really want to ruin the image of Gray Wolf on the air.  He's a bum, Drew.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, of the song.  But, you know, unfortunately, I tried to do some vocals with Gray Wolf, and he could not  pull off the song at all.  He couldn't even pull off the hook.  He couldn't hit the shelter me note.  But he was kind of doing it at the shopping spree a mere week ago. 
[01:43:00]  He was kind of doing it.  But, you know, that was on the phone.  You put him in front of a mic, he was missing all the notes.  He couldn't.  Was he just nervous, maybe?  Yes.  A 51-year-old guy nervous?  Yes.  I don't know.  I'm thinking if we can drag him in here.  Get him drunk.  Get him drunk a little bit.  Get him to do it again on the mic like he did.  And then have you, you know, work your magic.  Well, it's not only that.  I mean, I have to work on getting him.  What I was going to do was have him, you know, work with him to put more singing in the 
[01:43:30]  second verse.  He's talking through most of the whole second verse.  Yeah.  I don't want to hear him talking.  Goddamn.  I don't want to hear him sing.  Yeah.  Just give him fire water.  That's what you want.  Fire water.  He was nervous.  He probably, no one's ever done anything legitimate with him before.  He's usually probably had to sing to get out of a beating.  Don't hit me, officer.  Well, he's going to have to again if he doesn't fucking do that song.  Two hours of trying to do the Shelter Me note, he could have gotten over a little bit 
[01:44:00]  of nervousness.  Really?  You know.  It was a disaster.  It was a disaster.  The mucus was popping in his throat and everything.  It was awful.  Well, would you have the audio?  No, because it would have just completely ruined his image.  Yeah.  It's not like we do that on a daily basis here on this show.  I didn't want to do that.  I mean, you know.  Should have pulled an Ike Turner on him.  He sleeps in his own urine.  Yeah, you should have raped him on a console and beat him.  That's a good song, Gray Wolf.  I thought he worked with Phil Spector to rape him.  If I had brought in the audio of him singing and fucking up the singing, it would have 
[01:44:30]  really ruined the original song.  But it would have made for a great hour of radio.  What's wrong with you?  Can we do a Milli Vanilli?  We'll get some young Indian fella.  Shelter me from the funny rain.  All confident and just sober.  Get some studio guy in to sing it.  That's not a bad idea.  I'm sure some people would be happy to do their own renditions of Shelter Me and parodies  and what have you.  Oh, brother.  Anthony's got to...  Yeah.  All right.  Let's do that.  Thank you, Drew.  The update on Gray Wolf. 
[01:45:00]  We'll have a man to do the whole song.  We'll see what happens, because he does have the second half written, finally.  No, he doesn't write.  That's another thing.  Well, he talks through it.  But there's been some great artists over the years that talk through their songs.  Alice's Restaurant.  Alice's Restaurant.  Come on.  Lou Reed.  Lou Reed does a little bit of talking.  God, can I not fucking stand?  I don't know what the hell it was.  I don't have XM in the bathroom, so I usually just put on a news station or something.  But I think Jack was on, and some Lou Reed song comes on, and I'm in the shower, so I 
[01:45:30]  can't even get out to change the fucking station and not get electrocuted, reaching on and grabbing  the radio.  It was so God awful.  Anything that piece of shit has put out has just been awful.  I'm sorry.  I don't get it.  I don't get Lou Reed.  What about Walk on the Wild Side?  The worst ever.  The worst ever.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Wild side.  You can't sing out of note. 
[01:46:00]  And the colored girls go, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  I just like that.  I like that.  No, it's awful.  You picture just black women going doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.  It's just silly.  No.  What's wrong with this song?  Listen to him.  He can't sing.  Listen to it.  I've played this about a thousand times on the radio.  He's got this career, and he's all off keys.  And with every fucking thing that comes out of his mouth isn't even on any kind of a key.  And he's a dick.  But Anthony, the colored girl sing.  I came from Miami, FLA. 
[01:46:30]  I like this.  It strikes away across the USA.  Horrid.  Plugged her eyebrows on the way.  Shaved her legs, and then he was a she.  She says he'd be.  Oh.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Too hip for the fucking room, man.  God, I can't stand this guy.  And the fact that he has any type of career at all still annoys me.  Does he have other songs?  Sweet Jane.  No.  Another awful song.  Well, how does that go? 
[01:47:00]  Sweet Jane.  Sweet Jane.  50 times.  Sweet Jane.  And they just play it.  The second I hear that song come on, I risked electrocution to turn it off.  I don't know Sweet Jane.  Do we have that?  I don't know.  I know the colored girl goes.  You know Sweet Jane.  Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.  Horrid.  What the hell is that?  Is this Sweet Jane?  No.  Not the Sweet Jane I know.  I'd get the Sweet Jane.  Oh, you rocked version. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  You rocked.  You rocked.  Oh, you rocked.  Is that the Paul Abdul version that you enjoy?  Nathaniel's raising his hand.  He has it.  They're all laughing in there.  Nathaniel?  Yes, Dan?  No, sorry.  I was laughing at Anne's impression real quick.  All right.  E-Rock's got the real Sweet Jane.  No, this is live.  Sweet Jane. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, so you have to hit the stage there and all those filthy hippies are fucking applauding.  Yeah, man.  Jam it out.  The beginning of this.  Go on for eight minutes before his awful vocals kick in.  Blue Reed.  My ass.  Listen to this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What is he doing?  He's not singing.  He does sing.  Gray Wolf would be much better.  No, he wouldn't.  Let's hear the chorus.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[01:49:00]  All right.  Anthony made his point.  Thank you.  Anthony made his point.  We don't need a half hour of talk on Lou Reed.  I'd rather listen to some Santana.  God awful.  TV just did something that was a little crazy.  Danny picked this up for us.  Hidden messages behind the gifts you gave this holiday season.  Hmm.  Psychologically, you were telling your spouse something by the gift you gave her or him.  What's it mean if you gave her a shotgun with a toe attachment? 
[01:49:30]  So, here we go.  Or not.  Or we don't.  But.  Press the button.  Hit the button.  It's playing.  It sure is.  What happened, Hawk?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  E-Rock.  Oh, boy.  It's my fault.  It is your fault.  You didn't test it and re-listen to it before.  That's right.  Yeah, there's nothing on here. 
[01:50:00]  Nothing.  We will prove, once again, that we're brilliant broadcasters because now we have to make shit up.  Well, that's no problem.  No.  I'd like to know what happened with this.  So, maybe we could get a better copy of that.  Or a copy of that.  As we move forward with our fine radio program.  Look at you and get her a subtle gift.  Panties with, like, a stick-up in the front.  Is that subtly saying something?  Hidden message.  A bra with toilet tissue in it. 
[01:50:30]  Hidden messages in your gift?  Or a fucking porno movie called Girlfriends Who Fuck Their Boyfriends With Their Girlfriends  and Then Kill Themselves.  All right, we could do a quick news story.  Eternity, clothes, and a Hoover vacuum?  Hidden, subliminal, something there?  Yeah.  Yeah, like a little baby on board shirt with a nice footprint in the middle.  Wow. 
[01:51:00]  I'm getting a communique from Than.  Urgent communique from Than.  Bob Kelly on Than.  Yeah, I knew.  Okay.  Sorry.  Oh, we apologize, too, but that sounded like a little, hey.  Sarcastic.  Sorry.  Hey, fuck off.  Wasn't it?  Dude, what's with that?  That was a don't kill the messenger.  Yeah.  It's like, all right.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Sorry, motherfucker.  Hope you had a nice piss, Opie.  Yeah.  That was exactly what Than was saying.  Uh, Than wants me to go to Bob Kelly, so we'll go to Bob Kelly.  That's right.  Fans call. 
[01:51:30]  Ah.  Let's see how good this works out for everybody.  It's going to be fantastic.  Uh, Bob Kelly?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  What's up, buddy?  Hi, Bob.  How you guys doing?  Happy, uh, happy one-year anniversary.  Thank you so much, Bob.  What the fuck?  It's not...  Whatever.  Even though, yeah.  We've been on a year and three months.  Yeah.  Happy one-year and three-month anniversary.  Hello?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Than, you want to ask Bob a question, or...?  Once again, I want to thank Than for the post that he gave me. 
[01:52:00]  Two minutes ago.  What's going on, Bob?  Dude, I'm in, uh, Buffalo, New York.  Oh.  Trying to get my, trying to get my Continental Elite miles.  I had to fly to Buffalo.  So you flew...  I flew to Buffalo, and I'm jumping right back on the plane.  Yeah, I hear this is a thing that a lot of people do at the end of the year.  They have to get their miles in, in order to qualify for elite status.  So they take flights to nowhere. 
[01:52:30]  And back.  And back.  Patrice did it.  Patrice did the same thing?  He's in L.A. right now because he needed 5,000 miles.  So he just flew to L.A. and back.  Oh, I don't know if he came back yet.  I imagine he will.  But Bob, you flew to Buffalo, and you're not even leaving the airport?  No, I didn't even leave.  I left the plane for two seconds.  I'm jumping back on the same plane.  They're going to think I'm a freaking creep.  Patrice just went one way.  The other way, they have to throw ether in his face and put him on a boat through the Panama Canal. 
[01:53:00]  Patrice flew to Skull Island, but he's not coming back the same way.  He's going to have a nice long boat ride.  Well, are you in the Buffalo airport now?  Yeah, I'm getting right back on this plane.  That is the weirdest thing when people have to do this to get their miles up.  So your whole day is going to Buffalo and back.  Do you choose where to go?  Do you decide, like, I won't just go to Buffalo airport?  Yeah, why wouldn't you make something of it?  I know, because I'm a loser.  And why would you pick a place that could have snow delays and all that bullshit? 
[01:53:30]  Pick fucking, why don't you go to, like, Daytona or something?  Yeah, go to Florida and back.  At least you're guaranteed that there's going to be no delays.  Warm weather.  And you don't have to white-knuckle it as you're wondering if the plane's going to crash because of the icing and all that.  Maybe somewhere, yeah, where they might have to de-ice your plane.  Fuck that.  I hate flying to begin with.  Why would you ever fly to Buffalo and back in the middle of winter?  Be my wingman, man.  Thank you, sir.  I don't know.  I just stupid Jason Steinberg told me I had to do this because I need to be elite. 
[01:54:00]  Norton got me addicted to Norton Nental.  What do I know about that?  Norton Nental.  Norton Nental.  He did the same thing to me.  And me.  I only fly Continental now.  Jimmy's a spokesperson for them now.  They're going to give you free airfare anywhere you want to go, Jimmy.  I don't want nothing.  Maybe the occasional upgrade.  But, you know, I'm already platinum again, so whatever.  I had an extra flight I took to L.A.  I actually used miles last time, so I didn't have to ask XM or HBO to pay for it.  Didn't even have to pay. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, just your miles.  Just my miles.  $90,000 until I left.  But I'm still early, which is pretty much nothing.  The same as not being elite.  So when do you get back on the plane?  I just got off, but I'm getting right back on right now.  That is the weirdest.  And he picked Buffalo.  I know.  That's Bob Kelly.  But that's a cheap flight, too, though.  That's probably a cheap flight, right?  Is it cheap to go to Buffalo?  Yeah, of course.  I'm sure it's cheap to fly to Pittsburgh.  It's slightly warmer in Pittsburgh than Buffalo.  Huh?  How you doing?  I just got off.  I'm getting back on.  I did it. 
[01:55:00]  She's looking at me.  I did it to get my elite miles.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She doesn't care.  Uh-oh.  Telling you how it's bombed.  You know about me?  Yeah, just yell bomb real loud so they might hear it through the phone.  Bomb!  Hey, Bob, strap your Carson Daly set to your chest and run on the plane.  Hey, Bob, let me talk to the students.  No.  Why?  No.  You will absolutely have the fucking feds here fucking with you.  Let me talk to the students.  Don't do it, Bob.  No. 
[01:55:30]  Let me talk to the students.  Do not give them a phone.  Let me talk to the students.  I'm bit-blocking.  The feds will be here.  I swear I will hit the dumb button.  Put me here.  The fucking FAA and the fucking FBI and the NSA and everyone else doesn't take that  as a joke.  And the NBA.  They'll all be here.  Ladies and gentlemen, any of you authorities that were listening, that was satire you were  just hearing.  That's right.  Complete and total satire.  I don't even know where Bob is.  I don't know where Bob is.  He's probably not even in an airport. 
[01:56:00]  No, I think he is.  No, he's not.  That's a sound effect.  What happened?  What happened, Anthony?  Anthony's, uh...  Anthony's...  Oh, my God.  Anthony's trying to use one of his...  Anthony's trying to use one of his noisemakers.  It's the end of the year.  All the batteries are dead.  We're going to have to...  We're going to have to get new batteries for you. 
[01:56:30]  My God.  Someone's going to hang.  Bob.  I could have you shot for that.  Bob.  Yeah.  There's a lot of talking going on.  I was just kidding, Bob.  What's going on?  Yeah, that was really fantastic.  Everything's fine now.  Everything's fine?  Yeah, they upgraded me.  Oh, you got up class.  Very nice.  First class to Buffalo.  For a 15-minute flight.  That's like eating shit off Pam Anderson's tits.  All right, Bob. 
[01:57:00]  Have a great return flight to New York City.  All right, guys.  God bless.  Bye, sweetie.  God bless.  Look at him.  If he ever gives a fucking 50-year-old Italian man sign off like that again, I'm going to spit in his face.  God bless.  Get home safe.  God bless to you and yours.  God bless.  God bless.  God bless.  Hey, Fez.  I'll see you, God willing.  All right, they're going to try to get batteries for you there, Anthony.  Please.  For your noisemakers.  Something's happened.  Your box of noisemakers.  They weren't put out in the first place, and then they're broke. 
[01:57:30]  I understand.  Thanks there, Hawk.  Yeah.  Maybe toying around those wrestling sites.  All day on the wrestling sites.  Yeah.  I want to thank Van.  That was a good pickup.  I want to thank you for the post-it.  I'm very glad that you helped out the show there.  It was very good.  You're being sarcastic as he was when he said.  It turned out good.  It turned out good.  He made the right call.  Thank you.  Much to the chagrin of everyone else.  Right.  No one likes when any of these guys do something good.  Hidden messages behind the gifts you gave this holiday season, all right? 
[01:58:00]  I think we got a good copy of this.  We got a good copy?  Yes.  You're not just giving a gift.  You're trying to tell this person something with your gift.  We're talking about your relationships, and you doubtless dropped a few hints for your partner this year about what you wanted for the holidays and probably didn't get any of it.  But depending on what he did get you, there's a message in there.  There's a hidden message in that present.  And Nicole Belan from Women's Health Magazine is here to help us break that code. 
[01:58:30]  Hi.  Tell him what his gifts mean.  Hello.  Hi.  There's always a hidden message, no matter what it is.  Always.  Always.  Nothing is by accident.  Whether it's conscious or subconscious, there's a message.  Right.  Because my wife loved the circular saw I got her.  I bet she did.  She loved it.  Wow.  This is...  See, because he probably wanted the circular saw.  Right.  So...  Oh.  That was some good humor. 
[01:59:00]  That was...  They're always funny, the other news.  That was some fantastic off-the-coming entertainment.  But let's talk about particulars, starting with clothes.  Now, that's an interesting choice for a man to buy a woman because the size thing is a...  It's a trap.  Well, not just the size thing.  There's the style thing, which you probably wouldn't even think of when you're shopping  for your wife.  But take these outfits, for example, are a complete disaster.  Come on.  But the good news is, if your guy gets you clothes, it's because, you know, they're warm, 
[01:59:30]  they're fuzzy, they're going to be next to your body all the time.  Every time you wear it, you're going to think of him.  So, even if he blows the style completely and his two sides is off, you still...  There's a message there.  The intention was good.  Of course, if the clothes are completely unlike anything you would ever wear, it could be a  hint that he wants you to be a little bit sexier or less so in the case of that one.  Thinner.  Sexier getting the sweater.  Naturally.  And the ankle-length skirt.  But still, it's a very romantic thing. 
[02:00:00]  You're going to wear it all the time.  Think of him.  Okay.  That was just babbled.  How about if he buys himself a shirt that says, I'm with the fat cunt, it has an arrow  on it.  It could have a hidden message in it.  That's right.  Yeah, what psycho babble was she spouting?  It's warm and fuzzy.  How about this?  I want thigh highs because your slacks are making me physically ill.  That's why.  Very simple.  This is very popular on TV, getting the women from these women's magazines to throw their  two cents into this.  Why'd you get her that sweat?  Well, it's all warm and fuzzy. 
[02:00:30]  He likes me to think of them.  Sir, why'd you get that?  It makes your tits look great.  Right.  There's no messages.  You're running around the mall going, I think she might like this.  You have no idea what you're buying.  You're last minute shopping.  You're getting other mom jeans with a big room for the bunt in the front.  There's no real thought behind it.  Let's go to Greg the Trucker.  Greg?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Greg.  Hey, Greg.  Happy birthday to you, little Jimmy.  Is this the last birthday for this year? 
[02:01:00]  No.  Well, it's the last live birthday.  There might be one that's a repeat tomorrow.  Oh, God.  What's up there, Greg?  Hey, all I've got to say is I think Opie missed it.  It sounded like that was fantastic.  Punch it out, guys.  Thanks for the great show.  You know what, fan?  You can't punch out.  That was fantastic.  I give him the thumbs up with the halo and the angel wings.  Now, shoes, completely different message, you think?  Yeah, kind of a sexy message. 
[02:01:30]  Really?  Actually, psychologists compare shoe shopping with foreplay because shoes are such an intimate  thing.  No, they don't.  You would never get anyone's shoes unless they were your best friend or your significant other  because you have to know a lot about their body, the shape of their feet, their shoe size,  in order to get them shoes.  So, shoes is a very intimate, sexy gift.  Ain't even the same motherfucking ballpark.  It's ridiculous.  You can't find it.  How do you find shoes?  Hey, will these shoes let me come in their mouth?  Yeah, foreplay.  A message to all psychologists out there, stop making shit up.  Yeah, stop. 
[02:02:00]  That's the same thing as licking box.  Going shoe shopping.  Yeah, right.  That's foreplay.  Dr. Scholl's in your vagina.  Would that be?  An odory.  Psychologists say.  No, they don't.  Yeah, one guy is a lying bitch at a party.  One guy that was bored decided to come up with a new theory.  Shut up.  You know, shoe shopping.  Yeah, he's probably standing at some party with her.  And it was a psychologist.  And he goes.  And they were talking about something.  And he's just trying to get laid.  Yeah.  And she brings up shoes.  And he goes, you know, shoe shopping. 
[02:02:30]  Not like foreplay for a couple to go into a shoe store.  It's, you know, a very sensuous portion of the body.  And it's a very...  Can I fuck you?  This is what I'm working on.  Boston Ryder from Boston, of course, on the S&P Back.  I bought my wife a gym membership in a case of Weight Watchers.  Shakes.  Do you think there was a hidden message there?  It might be too subtle, guy.  I don't know.  Drop a treadmill on her head.  Plus, that's all women talk about is their fucking shoes.  They complain about shoes.  So we don't know what else to get you.  We're like, all right, all she talks about is shoes. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Have some shoes.  Because I would never attempt to buy a girl's shoes.  What would you possibly...  They're so...  They don't know what the hell they want as far as shoes go.  Like, you're going to pick something out that they want, that they're going to like?  You're not going to take back?  Roman, those fucking Roman-esque high-boot shoes that look sexy on a chick?  I want the Arab curly-toed ones.  Yeah.  Or the court jester ones with the bells on them. 
[02:03:30]  You like these, baby?  Here's his theory on buying a blender for a woman.  Now, the appliance, the kitchen appliance in particular.  Not good.  Not really a crowd favorite.  Well, we don't get excited when we open up the blender, you know, or the knife set.  Because we think it's not romantic, it's not flashy.  But, in fact, it's a really nice gift.  Because what he's thinking of is, what does she do every day?  What does she complain about around the house?  What does she need?  So when he gets you the blender, it's because I'm paying attention.  It's a really down-to-earth way to show that he cares. 
[02:04:00]  And it's a tool, it's a gadget.  It's a tool.  Who's buying this shit?  It actually says that he cares.  That's right.  He's sick of blackening your eye for fucking up his orange juice.  So he decided to get you a blender to make it easier.  He's not thinking of you.  He's trying to free you up so you do stuff to him.  He's in Walmart, fuck it, December 23rd going, I've got a day and a half to get this shit done.  That's what it is.  Blender whore. 
[02:04:30]  Blender, you can buy a blender at a Duane Reade drugstore.  That's how romantic that gift is.  He's thinking about you.  No, he's not.  You know what shows it cares?  It shows that he's not thinking.  If you buy, like, a little necklace with a heart.  A little heart.  A heart, because heart means love.  A lot of people did that, Jimmy.  Heart.  Well, we're going to do the jewelry thing right here.  The jewelry thing comes up.  Here's what they say about jewelry.  Well, every woman wants jewelry, and the reason why is because it's a symbol of commitment.  Even if you've been dating for a couple of weeks and it gets you a little pair of earrings, 
[02:05:00]  it still means I think our relationship could go far.  Because we all know diamonds, of course, are a symbol of marriage.  Right.  And anything like diamonds and jewelry is a symbol of love.  It's a symbol of commitment.  What's the most innocuous, like, innocent jewelry product?  Copper bracelet.  The bracelet?  Well, the bracelet is a great starter jewelry gift, you know?  And you kind of can't go wrong with a bracelet.  So if you get, like, a little silver bracelet.  Handcuffs.  I buy girl diamonds, but I don't give them to her. 
[02:05:30]  She has to eat them, like Olivia, at the end of the marathon, man.  Jewelry isn't commitment, necessarily.  No.  It's if someone's got money and wants to get laid.  Exactly.  That's what it is.  Flashy.  Here you go.  Flash.  Keep your eyes on this while I'm fingering it.  Jesus.  Well, Kevin from Connecticut, my wife asked me for a new watch, and I said, there's a clock  on the stove, bitch. 
[02:06:00]  Oh!  And Pat from Minaki writes, if I buy her a vacuum, will she suck it?  Oh.  Oh.  Oof.  Comment on the shoe thing from Teresa in Indiana.  Teresa.  Yeah.  We love when the bitches call.  What's up, Teresa?  Love when the bitches call, huh?  She loves you bitches.  We love the bitches.  What's up?  Shoe shopping gets me excited.  Yeah. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, you're saying you don't think it's true, I think.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying it doesn't get the woman excited, but it's not like a foreplay thing like they're  saying, like the guy going in there and shopping for shoes with the girl is nothing  like foreplay.  And you girls are buying shoes, so other girls look at your shoes.  Guys don't look at shoes.  We can care less.  If when you're trying the shoes on, you're sitting on an overturned high heel shoe, perhaps  that's a little sexy.  Maybe we just want to look up your skirt while you try them on. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Shoes do nothing for almost all guys out there.  We don't get the shoe thing.  Do you think the same is true for Paul McCartney when he's out there looking for a left only?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, what do you do with the extra shoe?  Exactly.  Charity.  What do you do?  A whole closet full of pristine right shoes.  Perfect tread in them.  Can't sell them on eBay.  Right shoe for sale. 
[02:07:30]  But we have the other one.  We'd like the other one.  No, I don't.  No.  It's not available.  I'm using that one.  Me wife is using that one.  Do you use the other one to grow herbs?  I mean, what are you doing?  A little planter.  A little planter.  Yeah, there's probably all kinds of decorative things.  Their Christmas tree is all just shoes.  Hanging from the rear view mirror, there's two full-size right shoes.  What's the protocol?  You give her the one shoe and then you have a ceremony and throw the other one out.  Do you find someone that only has a left leg? 
[02:08:00]  What do you do?  You put them in the same place as where all the other half of the pantyhose are hanging.  Oh.  Yeah, there's a lot of hemming on the old pantyhose.  Teresa?  Do some pantyhose hemming.  Anything else about shoes?  It's been fascinating so far.  Who said?  Huh?  What'd you say?  Anything else about shoes?  Left shoe.  We don't need you.  Buy a right shoe and make it better. 
[02:08:30]  John in New York.  I don't even know which leg is missing.  I don't either.  Hey, baby, what do you want from Victoria's Secret?  I'd like a thigh high.  John.  Okay, Jimmy.  I tried to give a hint to my wife.  I bought her a necklace with pearls on it and she didn't get it.  She didn't get the pearl necklace.  No.  That's too bad.  I bought my girlfriend one year a really long necklace and a stool.  Rich on Long Island.  Rich.  Hey, Rich. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, man.  You guys are slowing down on us.  Let's go.  What's up, Rich?  I got a little comment to make about OJ.  Jimmy, you make orange juice on a blender?  Well, you probably know, but you can because it would mush up all the seeds.  Sorry.  Yeah, that was a little.  I got the whole concept of the joke, sir.  He could have said a smoothie.  I mean, I wouldn't have said a smoothie.  I don't know.  I didn't know.  Messing up the smoothies, right.  A milkshake.  Probably would have been better.  A daiquiri. 
[02:09:30]  Ooh, daiquiri's a funnier word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would have worked better.  At least I didn't say messing up is milk.  Yeah.  At least orange juice has to be blended.  You can, sir.  Let's just say you're married to a toothless cancer patient, and they have to just sip orange  juice that has had all the pulp mushed in a blender.  You need applesauce fucking orange juice.  Blender mushed.  That's good stuff.  Let's go to Bob in Pittsburgh.  Bob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to know, next year for Christmas, I'd like to buy my wife a rock 
[02:10:00]  coat, but I don't know if she'd get the right message.  A rock coat.  A rock coat.  Yeah.  If cruise tickets and a rock coat are under the tree, it could say something.  He bought me a vacation to Karachi by myself.  Karachi.  Mike, it's Karachi.  It's the most dangerous city for Westerners in the world.  It's Karachi.  That's where Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and murdered.  All right.  Let's go.  I hear Singapore is not a good place to go either, just because there are laws. 
[02:10:30]  Very strict over there.  Oh, crazy.  Are they?  And if you fuck up, you go to jail, you get beaten, and sometimes put to death.  For what, though?  For anything.  Do you know if you take, if you have drugs on you, the death penalty?  They don't want to fucking hear shit.  You are dying.  Where'd the kid get the caning?  That was Singapore.  That was Singapore.  Yeah, Singapore.  He was vandalizing some cars with a few buddies and whacked with a cane.  But he didn't do that again, though.  No. 
[02:11:00]  Taught him.  But he fucked with a Saturn and got caught.  He had some guy who was trying to smuggle, I guess, hashish out of there just recently,  a couple weeks back.  And they were all, you know, people coming out saying, don't put him to death, you know,  pleading for him.  He was trying to make money to give to his brother who needed money or some shit.  And, no, death penalty.  They killed him?  And they had the head muckety-muck of Singapore.  I don't know what they call him.  Premier?  President?  What is he?  I don't know.  But he was up there on TV going, look, these are our laws.  You adhere to them or you pay the price. 
[02:11:30]  He goes, and the crime rate there is ridiculously low.  They have the cleanest streets.  You're not allowed to spit or litter.  Like, littering?  You go to fucking jail.  You go to jail.  Was he, wait, was the guy executed?  Oh, yeah.  Was he an American or a Singaporean?  No, he was, uh, he was Chinese.  Why would you smuggle hash out of Singapore?  Why?  Go to Turkey.  Go to Turkey.  Fly to Turkey.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  What do they do there, though?  They make turkey noises.  You gotta, uh, you gotta hang the warden up by a hook by the back of his neck and run away. 
[02:12:00]  There's two little fat children come in.  Two little fat children.  Not unlike Ben Sparks at that age.  Even though Ben's not fat, they look like two little Steve C's.  Hello, our father's the warden here.  They absolutely did.  Was that Midnight Express?  Midnight Express.  Don't try to smuggle hash or Papa will hit you.  It's going to beat your feet.  It's going to beat your feet.  It's very painful.  And then have a homoerotic experience with you before you put his head on the hook and sneak out. 
[02:12:30]  All right, we got one more hidden message in GIFs audio clip here.  Well, most women probably wouldn't, unless you just started dating.  We don't really fake the GIFs response.  I mean, we'll say, thank you so much.  I really like it.  But if she's over the moon and loves it, you'll know because she'll gush.  You know, and she'll go, she'll say, oh, I like it so much.  And she'll use it all the time.  But if she's just like, oh, that's so nice.  I mean, you know that she doesn't like it.  What does it mean when my wife gave me a restraining order?  What does that mean?  Thank you so much for you.  And Angie. 
[02:13:00]  I kind of like that.  That was a domestic violence joke.  Yeah, domestic violence joke.  That's a real scream.  He's a card.  That guy is a panic.  What a douche.  We were talking about Gary Glitter yesterday.  Yes.  There was rumors about him paying off families.  Well, it's true.  Rocker Shocker.  Oh, shocker rocker.  That rhymes, Ope.  Glam Perv pays two families in sex case. 
[02:13:30]  Hanoi.  Pervy former glam rocker Gary Glitter has paid $2,000 each to two Vietnamese families of girls he is accused of sexually abusing to get them to ask cops to drop the case against him.  That is cheap.  That is unbelievably cheap.  Yeah.  If we pay the money for the two families, when this case goes to court, maybe Mr. Gary will receive a lighter penalty, said his lawyer.  Let's answer.  Miss Gary, I just picture a guy with real thick glasses smoking cigarette after cigarette, little thin mustache, Vietnamese lawyer. 
[02:14:00]  Pulls up on one of those scooters with a whore on the back.  Nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang, nang.  He'll love you a long time.  Rape charges involving the two girls ages 11 and 12.  Oh.  Jesus, were recently dropped, but Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gad, still is under  suspicion of committing lewd acts with children.  And this is regular radio, so we can't tell you what the lewd acts are. 
[02:14:30]  Please put in a quarter for three more Vietnamese children.  He's 61, faces up to 12 years in jail.  Hey.  In Vietnam, that's a bit scary.  Vietnamese jail.  Well, uh, prosecutors said the money paid would have no bearing on whether the case goes  to trial.  Yeah, but the case for the lower charge.  And Glitter was convicted in Britain in 1999 of possessing child porn and served half of  a four-month jail term. 
[02:15:00]  Four months?  Half of that.  So he did two months for child pornography in Britain.  He's a fucking kitty toucher.  They should just fucking shoot him.  This guy's a predator.  Just shoot him.  He's not going to reform.  He got caught, so he goes to another place to do it, another country.  You know how bad you have to want to fuck kids to get a fucking passport to do it?  Ask Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  Where he is, off in some faraway land where the American laws can't touch him.  Vietnam.  We got two other great stories today. 
[02:15:30]  Listen to this one.  Welcome back.  A hotel near Kennedy Airport that investigators served as a brothel is now closed.  Cops padlocked the executive motor in last week.  The Queens D.A. says he received a number of complaints about it in the past few months.  Police raided it and arrested two people.  The undercover operation disclosed the night manager allowing prostitutes and pimps to congregate there. 
[02:16:00]  The D.A. says some of the prostitutes included runaways as young as 13.  This guy was just trying to make a little extra cash in with his night job.  Yeah.  You know, when a hotel has executive in the title, it's far from executive.  There's no executive, Jerry.  The executive is one of those false words used to make a piece of shit look better.  Yeah, I'm going to be checking in to the executive.  You can catch me there before our business dinner. 
[02:16:30]  The executive by the airport.  No.  Nothing executive about it.  13-year-old runaways at the executive.  The executive.  Yeah, closed down.  All right.  So that was going on down there.  Good.  One less hellhole.  And then you've got to hear this one.  This is zero.  The babysitter, Chris, on Long Island in trouble with the law this morning.  It's not good.  Sheriff's deputies found a two-year-old in his care drunk at a house in Patchogue.  Two years old.  They say 37-year-old Juan Reyes was babysitting the boy and his four-year-old sister and that Reyes was passed out drunk. 
[02:17:00]  The deputies had arrived on an unrelated matter.  The boy's alcohol level was .094.  You see a two-year-old child like that, obviously in distress.  It really hits home and it was just a very disturbing image.  It's undetermined whether the child got into the alcohol by himself or it was given to him.  Reyes faces charges of endangering the child's welfare. 
[02:17:30]  The boy's parents were in the hospital for the birth of their third child.  No kid's going to drink on his own.  No?  It tastes too shitty.  They should prosecute that kid for underage drinking.  Yes.  That's what the story's about.  What could be funnier than a drunken two-year-old?  Exactly.  How fun would that be to watch?  Just stumbling around the house, falling down.  You can laugh at him and point.  Where's my rattle, motherfucker?  And you know it's just ending in a vomit fest.  Dizzy and confused.  He doesn't know. 
[02:18:00]  A little head spinning.  Doesn't know why he's all fucked up.  A little fat feet kicking.  He wants his toys one minute.  He wants to eat.  He's throwing up.  He wants to watch Bob the Builder and Dora the Explorer.  That whole effort.  Starts confessing shit about Uncle Jesse.  Let me tell you about that, motherfucker.  I don't think he's supposed to go coochie, coochie, coo on my taints, is he? 
[02:18:30]  He touched me where my bathing suit covers.  Fucking asshole.  I'm going to open up my mind for this bit because I can't come up with it,  but I'm thinking it'd be three rights make a left baby joke,  but I just don't have it.  I want to go crib.  There you go.  I want to go crib.  There it is.  I was playing with my blocks, and I got hammered.  I don't understand how it happened. 
[02:19:00]  I was playing with my blocks.  I thought it was my sippy cup full of Coke, Coca-Cola,  and it turned out to be Bacardi, and now I'm hammered.  Didn't you crawl to the wrong house?  I once crawled to the wrong house and ended up in somebody else's playpen.  I fell asleep there, and there was a party going on. 
[02:19:30]  And they had to carry me back to my own crib because I was hammered.  I want a box of juice.  I want a box of juice.  Juice box.  Ah, banana-ma.  R.I.P.  Rest in peace, Judy. 
[02:20:00]  She died?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When?  My ex-mother-in-law.  During the summer, was it?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah.  She was a good old leg.  Oh, wow.  I like to party, that woman.  Definitely.  Anyway, that was funny for the old-school listeners  that understand the old mother-in-law bit.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, what's up?  I was talking about the drunken baby.  I wanted to ask you if it was like Steve-O. 
[02:20:30]  He was saying, I don't play.  I don't play.  I don't play.  Oh, another highlight from 2005  that everyone is not bringing up  in their countdown list.  Drunken Steve-O on awful Adam Carolla.  I love the show.  Punch it out.  All right, thanks.  We're going to try to find that clip for you.  All right, great.  All right.  Someone was saying that the kid  may have gotten drunk on the breast milk.  Matt from Largo.  Yeah, they had a story down here recently 
[02:21:00]  where they prosecuted the parents  for giving the kid liquor  and it wound up she was just a lush  and the kid was drinking spiked foot milk.  Yeah, well, since a guy was watching the kid  and the mother was giving birth in a hospital,  I don't think he was drunk on breast milk  and he was two years old.  Jesus.  All right.  Did you listen to the story?  Yes, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, could have been.  Here's Steve-O.  He was trying to strangle Adam Carolla.  Who wouldn't want to do that?  That good times. 
[02:21:30]  This was his moment of clarity  when he tried to choke Adam.  This is the Steve-O clip.  Another highlight from 2005.  I'm about to strangle you  out of your own consciousness.  We don't have the whole clip somewhere?  Oh, you do?  All right.  Listen to this.  Steve-O and Adam Carolla completely hammers.  What?  What?  Yeah, welcome back.  It's too late on that.  What?  I like that, bitch. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Bitch.  Tonight, the studio guest is Malcolm McClure,  the great author.  No.  Steve-O.  Eh, eh, eh.  Steve-O in studio tonight.  I like that, bitch.  Yeah.  That was Steve-O.  Must get his ass finished.  All right.  Steve has had a couple of glasses of shot in there.  Eh, I will tell you, bitch.  All right.  Steve, Steve, Steve, focus, baby.  Hey, hey, Steve.  Here's the thing.  All right.  We thought it'd be fun if you had a few drinks and then came out here and did a stunt. 
[02:22:30]  I would love that.  All right.  We're going to do that.  We're going to reel it in just a little bit.  I would love that.  We're going to get a focus now.  Going to focus on a couple of questions, take a few phone calls, then you do the stunt.  If I did not love Adam Carolla, then I would not love my business being here.  Right.  All right.  And I'm just saying, I'm saying tonight, Steve, it's important that you love Adam Carolla. 
[02:23:00]  Just don't love him.  Oh, my God.  Don't love him.  Don't love on him.  I love Adam Carolla so hard.  Yeah.  Over here, buddy.  Yeah, I will literally love Adam Carolla.  Yeah.  Into the ground.  Yeah.  Let me, what about, I want to see a couple of your tattoos for, we take some phone calls.  Hey, ask me for a tattoo, brother, man.  I know you got one of Angelina Jolie or Billy Bob Thornton or something like that.  You got the Billy, that's your Billy Bob one. 
[02:23:30]  What is, yeah.  What is this one down here that looks like it's a fan ball?  Oh, dear, I'm about to strangle you out of your own consciousness.  I thought you loved me.  I will kill you.  Oh, it's not going to go, you love me.  I love you.  No humping, no humping.  Easy, easy, buddy.  We got to finish the segment.  All right.  Hold on, hold on.  Steve, Steve, Steve.  Steve, Steve, Steve, I'm all right. 
[02:24:00]  Just fighting.  Steve was trying to choke him.  I don't know if I'm calling him.  All right, Steve, let's call the phone.  You ready to take some phone calls?  Come on.  No, no, no.  No, no, let's take some phone calls.  Oh, okay.  My mic flew off, so I got to use this thing.  All right, this is great.  I'm like, I feel like a Geraldo.  Oh, oh, oh, no, Steve, Steve. 
[02:24:30]  Steve, Steve, don't break me.  All right.  Steve, that was a rental.  I don't like that.  That was a rental, Steve.  I don't like that.  That was a rental.  All right, Steve.  Yeah, bitch.  Steve, hold on a second.  I'll tell you what I think we should do.  Yeah.  I was going to take some phone calls, Steve, but you're not playing.  I don't play.  You're not playing along.  I don't play.  If you can mind your P's and Q's.  I don't play.  We can take a couple phone calls and do a TV show. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah, I don't play.  Otherwise, you're just going to take a break and call security.  Yeah, I don't play.  All right.  All right.  I don't play.  All right.  So we'll get security.  Yeah.  What up?  We'll run the rest of the Jimmy Kimmel show.  And we'll be right back after this.  Oh, watch out, Steve.  Steve, watch out.  How great is that?  Dude, he sounds drunk.  That guy was a little tipsy.  How great is that? 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  I want to see that.  Oh, the video is awesome.  Completely drunk.  We had it up on the websites for a while.  It might be around.  Didn't the chair go over?  Like, the chair fell backwards?  He's trying to choke Adam Corolla?  I don't know.  Fantastic stuff.  Backing up slightly.  Paul in New York, what do you got?  Hey, buddy.  I'm one of the EMTs.  I was at that house in Patchogue yesterday.  Yeah.  With that kid that was drunk.  I'm freaking believable, man.  This guy that was sleeping in the apartment, they had to, like, put smelling salts under his nose just to wake him up. 
[02:26:00]  He was so whacked out drunk.  They didn't know if the kid.  We got contacted by poison control, actually, because they didn't know the kid, the two-year-old, what was wrong with him.  Because, you know, he was classy.  He smelled, like, beer and stuff or whatever.  Thought he was retarded or something, maybe.  Yeah.  They didn't know because they didn't know if he was trying to talk to the four-year-old girl.  And they asked her, did he take some chemicals?  Did he drink something, add it onto the sink or something?  And she didn't know.  And so they called us, and we took the kid.  The kid was blotto. 
[02:26:30]  Nothing would have happened.  Go ahead.  I think what's going to end up happening here, they're going to find out that the guy's a raging alcoholic.  He was babysitting.  He passed out, had beers laying around, and the kid got into the beers.  And it probably wouldn't take much to get the alcohol way up there.  No.  No, no.  Don't take much at all.  Actually, the guy that owned the apartment, he said he has no hard feelings against the cousin clothes.  He was drunk.  He was drinking.  And the kid just probably picked the bottle up and took a swig out of it.  Or the kid was crying, and he wanted to shut it up, so he gave it a drink, and he figured that would quiet it down. 
[02:27:00]  That'll do it.  Every time.  Well, happy birthday, Jimmy.  And guys, love you.  Have a great year, and keep on rocking, man.  Bye.  Talk to you next year.  Have a great year.  We have two days to have a great year.  Gee, thanks.  I know.  It hasn't started yet.  No, have a next year.  A good new year.  Have a good year.  What do you mean, have a next year?  Hey, dude.  XM is the best investment, I've got to admit.  Hey, Paul?  Your name's Paul?  Shit.  Your name's Paul?  Yeah.  Where are you, an ambulance driver?  It's a private ambulance company, AMR. 
[02:27:30]  Why?  I always thought they hated being called an ambulance driver.  Oh, well, an EMT, I said.  EMT.  Yeah, whatever.  Much more important.  They all hate that, though.  What, ambulance driver?  Yeah, if you're called an EMT, an ambulance driver.  Why?  Yeah, I know.  They're more than that.  Why?  Plumbers like being called maintenance engineers, too.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  All right.  Hey, we've got a bunch of things happening on this channel through the weekend.  All weekend, it's a 12-hour show that's going to happen. 
[02:28:00]  Yes.  It's going to replay all weekend long.  It's the best bits we've done since coming to XM Satellite Radio, okay?  Yeah.  And then tomorrow we're taking the day off, and it's four hours of bits we couldn't fit into the big special.  Right.  Extras.  So it's like, yeah, bonus material, what have you.  So it's going to be some really, really good stuff tomorrow as well.  So Friday through the weekend, just nothing but the best stuff we've done on Satellite Radio, okay?  Right.  With that said, Steve was in production, and he made all sorts of sweepers.  Yeah.  And he's trying out new characters, a theme where Travis is gay. 
[02:28:30]  Hey, will anything top Ramon?  No.  No.  No, that's like his big Oscar winner, and he's always going to be chasing that.  Absolutely.  He's like Timothy Hutton of production.  Yeah.  Ramon is brilliant, though, man.  It gave us some great fodder this year.  Mm-hmm.  But I want to go through some of the production pieces that Steve came up with here.  So do I.  It's Opie and Anthony's bonus bits, moments from the O&A show that we wanted to fit into 
[02:29:00]  the end-of-the-year special but didn't have room for.  Rituals jumping.  Bilber's Ozzfest PSAs.  Big A reads to Krista the blind girl.  Wheelchair Fred takes it in the dumper.  1950s sex ed films.  The sex offender game.  The fellatio game.  Except we never played that.  Not while you were awake.  I need to wash.  I like the acting was good.  Was it character work?  Right. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, character work.  Good job, Nathaniel.  Wonderful.  It was believable.  It was what I liked about it.  It was a little too natural.  Yeah.  Acting.  You can say acting.  You should put it on your acting reel, Sam, and just put, like, queer number three.  That was like fucking vaudeville.  So this is, how was that?  This is one of your new themes, though, right, Steve?  Yeah, Travis will interrupt.  Interrupt promos and sweepers to be gay, basically.  And here's another example of that.  And then on the way is Silly Danny and Dry Nathaniel. 
[02:30:00]  Two other concepts you're going with?  Yep.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Holy retarded.  Here we go.  It's Opie and Anthony's bonus bits.  It's kind of like all that extra material you get on a DVD.  Yeah, like all those extra fight scenes from The Matrix.  Or all those deleted cock scenes from Oz. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, or more like what I said.  Well, you say potato.  That's funny.  Excellent.  These guys are having fun.  I like it.  That is funny.  Definitely.  So far, so good.  And then it moves on to Silly Danny.  Yeah, Silly Danny is...  What's Silly Danny all about?  Silly Danny is a special child who tries to...  Oh, no!  Bless you, Ant.  Bless you, Ant.  Bless you.  Great.  I'm sick, too, now.  Thanks, everybody that works here.  Take some emergency. 
[02:31:00]  We decided they needed to come to work sick.  Welcome.  Are you sick?  Very.  Yeah.  He's extremely sick.  Yeah.  Can you pass out the emergency?  He's got like the typhus or something.  He's got some 1800s disease.  Somebody mix up some emergency for the boys.  What is that?  It doesn't.  It works.  It's got 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C.  Lemon, lime.  Have I had one, sweetie?  I've had three of them.  Get some water.  Who's not sick?  I got water.  Just throw me one.  There you go, Jimmy.  I am not taking any of that.  Dude, it's fantastic.  It's really good. 
[02:31:30]  Let me see a packet.  Lemon, lime, emergency for everybody.  It's really good.  More shit that doesn't help you when you're sick.  No, but it helps prevent you from getting sick.  Vitamins.  I haven't been sick yet.  I take this every day.  You're immune.  I'm on planes.  You eat hooker ass.  Yeah, exactly.  By the way, I have an idea for a new theme.  That's why you don't get sick.  They say if you want to go to Mexico and stuff, or if you travel a lot, you should drink the water.  Because eventually you get immune to the foreign water and you don't get the liquid shits.  You've got to go back every six months. 
[02:32:00]  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  My new character idea is how about a guy that sweats through his shirt in the middle of winter.  I'd love to make that one, you animal.  Wow.  Lift up.  Lift up.  Wow.  Now, Steve, can I defend myself slightly?  Sure, I want to photograph you.  You're fine.  Yeah, what powder are you on, too?  That's why I love Steve.  90 fucking degrees in that production room, because I'm surrounded by equipment that's  blowing hot air.  Yeah.  Can you turn this way, please? 
[02:32:30]  What's his name?  Master Poe?  Yeah, what supplement are you on that's making you sweat that much?  A couple of them.  I got one that's called Redline right now.  And I got another one that's called...  Steve is the king of the supplements.  I got another one called T-Bomb.  It's just a testosterone booster.  I don't think it's normal to sweat that much.  Testosterone booster?  Yeah, it just helps because I work out all the time.  I go to the gym and it, just because you tear a lot of muscle fibers, it helps the muscles  to regenerate faster.  Steve, it's just creepy that you're sweating through that shirt.  It's nice and...  Without a doubt.  It's so cold.  Jimmy's wearing a sweatshirt. 
[02:33:00]  And I'm all comfy and relaxed.  Yeah.  I came in here, it was freezing this morning.  I'm finally feeling like I'm not cold anymore, and he's sweating.  It's comfortable in here, but in my studio, I'm surrounded by equipment that's blowing  hot air on me, so it's whatever.  We heard.  I'm going to have a nice surprise in a few minutes.  Nobody wants that.  I like surprises.  All right, so we go to make sure line one doesn't go anywhere.  So Silly Danny's about what?  But Silly Danny is a character that Danny and I developed, and he's, you know, a special  boy.  A special boy that tries to segue, tries to promo the show. 
[02:33:30]  Uh-oh.  It's O.B. and Anthony's bonus balloons.  If I go a whole day without making a boom on the rug, I get a balloon.  I have safety scissors.  Jimmy?  I think...  Why don't you take this one?  I think that, first of all, we're missing something.  I think it's important to actually watch Danny do that.  Maybe Danny can come in and do that character.  Do it live.  You know what? 
[02:34:00]  I think that would help.  It is kind of a treat to watch him get into character.  I think that would be really nice.  Let's get Danny here to get into character and do Silly Danny.  Yeah, I think you can do...  I got another example as we get Danny.  Oh, okay.  Here's Silly Danny 2.  Or is there?  It's O.B. and Anthony's bonus bits.  I told you that there would be more bits that it would come back, and it was true.  It is back, and it is bonus bits of all time ever.  And when I go to the mall, I have to be on a leash.  Was that some kind of... 
[02:34:30]  Okay, terrific.  It's like a retarded thing, right?  Well, yeah.  I'll let you know more about it.  That was the direction that I received.  Ah.  I see.  Blame the book.  I like it.  Blame the director.  So you weren't really feeling it, were you?  I was told we needed a special character.  And who told you this?  The person that ran out of the studio because he doesn't want to deal with this? 
[02:35:00]  I told him to go get his camera.  I told Steve to go get his camera.  Oh, okay.  Here comes Steve back into the studio.  I told him.  I asked him.  Well, we're going to get video of Danny doing Silly Danny?  Well, I don't know.  Apparently it has nothing to do with him.  Apparently it's all my fault.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Maybe we just don't know.  Chris from Missouri.  Go ahead, Chris.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Good morning.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hey.  I was calling to let you guys know.  I've been trying to get through for a few days to say that Special Danny is probably the most hilarious promo I've heard on XM202. 
[02:35:30]  Seriously.  Wow.  Others than the Ramones did, I would say Special Danny was a really close second.  It's Silly Danny.  Excellent.  Retards are always funny.  Always.  Silly Danny.  Thanks for the call, Danny's father.  Really fast, Kevin in Connecticut.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You didn't say what time the 12-hour best-of thing starts.  All weekend long.  So that would be Friday at midnight starts the weekend.  Okay.  East Coast time, so then you do your math for wherever you live. 
[02:36:00]  Okay?  Thanks.  All right.  Danny's going to do Silly Danny, if that's what you guys want, I suppose.  We're getting video of this for the websites.  We should see it.  I think that probably helps the character.  No.  Not really, but I'll do it if you'd like.  Hold on.  Before you do it, just to give you some inspiration here, Birthday Boy is checking in.  Birthday Boy.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is Birthday Boy.  Silly Danny sucks.  Bring back Toby.  Oh, no.  See?  Toby's better than that.  No, not Toby.  I think Silly Danny's better than Toby. 
[02:36:30]  Not Toby.  I don't know.  I think they should do it maybe back and forth.  I think that would be a fun idea.  This is probably a combo that features maybe Silly Danny.  I think that's an excellent idea.  Here's the problem.  Silly Danny is Toby.  See, Steve did not want to give up on the Toby thing.  Yeah.  So he changed the name and then made it a little different with a new character, thinking  it's going to get past us.  Nah.  I don't know if I agree with that.  I don't know if I agree with that.  All right.  All right.  Sweaty Steve thinks that Silly Danny and Toby are completely different.  About to be punched.  Norton disagrees, apparently.  Oh. 
[02:37:00]  Wait.  That's what he's getting there.  All right.  Well, what's my line?  What should I...  I think Silly Danny can improv.  Just be...  Oh, can he?  Just let's revisit one of the ones that he just played.  The Bonus Balloons one.  Bonus Balloons.  Yes.  That's what you want today?  Yes.  All right.  Let's see you get into it.  Here we go.  I have to flail about because that's what I'm going to do.  Yeah.  Yeah, he does.  He flails about in the studio when he does this.  No, he doesn't.  All right.  Yes, he does. 
[02:37:30]  That sucks.  Why don't you listen to the mic up so we can hear Silly Danny?  Okay.  Get silly.  I'm getting silly.  It's OPN Anthony's Bonus Balloons.  Oh, my God.  I can't even look at him.  Oh, my God.  I got fly sweat.  There is a window.  You can jump out of it at any time.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I should do it again because all the people are pounding.  Oh, so they can see it.  Yeah.  Yeah, stand over that way a little more by Drew's stuff and do it so the pal talk cameras 
[02:38:00]  can see you.  Don't forget to flail and get in character.  No, you've got to get between Drew and Jimmy would be the best spot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, use my mic, silly.  There you are.  Yeah, just use my mic.  There we go.  There you go, people.  A little treat for pal talk.  Here's Danny doing Silly Danny.  It's OPN Anthony's Bonus Blues.  Get out.  Get the fuck out. 
[02:38:30]  Put the headphones down and leave the room.  All right.  Very nice.  Oh, wow.  Moving on.  Now we have Dry Nathaniel.  Yeah.  This is actually done.  The initial appearance of Dry Nathaniel was done in response to the Toby promos.  It was sort of the complete antithesis to the over-the-top promos.  It's very monotone with a funeral dirge in the background.  Antithesis?  Opposite.  Oh, thank you.  You're welcome. 
[02:39:00]  Trust me, I wasn't alone on that one.  Oh, antithesis?  Yeah, thank you, Jimmy.  Yes.  All right.  Here's Dry Nathaniel.  Greetings.  I am Nathaniel.  It has come to my attention that you are in the midst of listening to Opie and Anthony's  Bonus Bits, a collection of humorous anecdotes and amusing stories from the Opie and Anthony  radio program.  These bits will accelerate your understanding of the various characters and personalities  associated with said radio serial.  Good day. 
[02:39:30]  Did somebody say penis?  You know, actually, Travis, I didn't.  All right.  I'll be back.  It's got potential.  You could get typecast real easy there, Travis.  You understand that.  It's a character called Hidden Camera.  All right.  And one more from Nathaniel.  Salutations, friend.  This is Nathaniel.  If I may be so bold, I must commend you on your decision to indulge in O&A's Bonus Bits. 
[02:40:00]  Not only will they broaden the breadth and scope of your knowledge of the casted characters  of the Opie and Anthony radio program, they will also brighten your spirit.  Hey, guys, which looks better, shaved or unshaved?  Seriously, what the fuck is your problem?  I hear ya.  Shame.  I like it, Steve.  Thank you.  I really do like it.  Dad, it's not bad.  Thank you.  Excellent.  A lot of thinking goes behind your production, which is really creepy to think about. 
[02:40:30]  I like it.  A lot of thought goes into it.  Now, Nathaniel handed in something.  E-Rock's rebuttal.  Remember last week everyone was making fun of E-Rock's over-the-top delivery?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were all doing the E-Rock.  Anyone have an E-Rock impression from last week for the new listeners?  It was just that, Danny, do you do an E-Rock impression?  Anyone in the studio do the E-Rock there?  Well, I think they do some voice tracks as E-Rock. 
[02:41:00]  I don't think I did one, but I could pull one off probably.  Do you do silly E-Rock?  Well, you get the hint.  You get the point.  They made fun of E-Rock and his delivery on some of this production.  So there was one from Travis.  Was Travis committing there a little bit?  The best bits of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, it's the best bits of Opie and Anthony.  It's E-Rock Radio on XM Satellite Radio.  Radio.  That's right.  It was radio and karaoke.  Radio.  Karaoke. 
[02:41:30]  That's right.  So E-Rock said, you know what?  I'm sick of taking it, so I'm going to fight back a little bit.  So E-Rock did some rebuttal voice tracks.  Oh, boy.  Where he makes fun of Nathaniel.  And how are you making fun of him here?  Just doing the dry, yeah, Nathaniel.  So do it now on the mic and ruin what's actually in the CD player.  Hey, did you get a haircut?  Another one?  You know what?  Your nickname should be Timmy Telegraph. 
[02:42:00]  I just want to point out how poorly E-Rock explains the joke here, because it's really  hard to pick up exactly what he's trying to get across.  All right.  All right.  Here's...  And jumping in for a little joke blocking.  Here's E-Rock doing Nathaniel.  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Nathaniel, and this is where Robert Kelly fucks a sink, and you can tell how enthusiastic  I am about this bit by the tone of my voice.  It's ONA's best bits.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  There are so many douche chills going on in this studio.  Now, you know what?  Maybe we need to give another track a listen.  All right.  Well, now here's E-Rock doing Travis.  Travis does the gay thing.  Are you doing a gay thing here?  No.  Oh, you didn't do a gay...  So how are you making fun of him?  Just that Travis didn't take a chance, so I didn't take a chance introducing the next  bit.  Oh.  Oh.  Working off of that whole don't take a chance, Travis thing. 
[02:43:00]  Hi, this is Travis, and I'm not going to take a chance telling you about what's coming  up in Stalker Patty.  Hey, let's make a deal part two, because I might just screw it up, so I'm not going  to take a chance.  It's ONA's best bits.  You do understand that the whole don't take a chance thing was Nathaniel's brainchild,  so you're almost giving Nathaniel a compliment by...  After you just trashed him.  By doing that.  Secondly, don't take a chance Travis is playing the most risky character ever on this program, 
[02:43:30]  this side of Brokeback Mountain.  Very hard to pull off the gay character when you're straight.  I believe you're straight.  Are you straight?  He puts a thumb up.  Says, oh, no, up Nathaniel's ass.  Now I'm still confused.  All right, well...  All right.  I'm digging that you're fighting back.  That we rock.  There's things going on after we go home that we can't even understand. 
[02:44:00]  No.  No.  But I like the way he doesn't do the impression.  This is what I like about it.  He doesn't do the voices.  He just kind of says what they do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is my impression of Anthony.  Hi, I'm Anthony, and I drive an SUV and live in Long Island.  Here's the next bit.  All right.  All right.  We'll move on to Hootie McBoob.  I just love...  What's wrong?  Completely unamused by any of this, Hawk is.  He's dissociating.  He won't look at anybody's eyes.  He doesn't look at anyone.  He just reads the computer screen, doesn't smile, but doesn't frown. 
[02:44:30]  Don't look him in the eyes, but don't look away.  Drop the gun.  Walk out.  I want my brother walking out of that radio studio with just his dignity in his hands.  Tune it out.  Happy place.  Happy place.  Yes.  I thought the fan one was pretty good, though.  Eh.  Not bad.  I'd love to hear that again.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know where it went from.  Let's say hi to Hootie McBoob. 
[02:45:00]  Hi.  Hootie McBoob, why are you calling the show?  I am the Sacrifice for Donkey Sausage for What's in My Pants.  Now, she wants to play Guess What's in My Pants.  Wait, I think I see you on Pal Talk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're on the cell phone.  On the phone.  I'm on the phone with you guys.  And you're Hootie McBoob in the Opie and Anthony room right now.  Yes, sir.  That has almost 200 people in it.  Yes.  It's got more than two.  It does today?  Yeah, it was at 210 just a little while ago.  It'll make 300 very soon.  Now, she has been flashing her boobs the entire time we've been watching. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, here she goes again.  A little wowage for everybody there.  That's very nice.  Very nice indeed.  But this is going to be what could be our first ever video Guess What's in My Pants.  Yeah.  Where she will play Guess What's in My Pants.  You know, some things are best left to the radio.  But, uh...  And then...  And then we can actually see what she has in her pants. 
[02:46:00]  No guesswork.  Sometimes this technology thing is a bad thing.  What was, um...  Who's next to her?  Is that a porno, Anthony?  That's just a porno that's been running for about two hours.  Cool.  She's really hot, though.  Hardcore pornography.  She's really hot.  Get that fat one off.  Yeah, I know.  I'm clicking that one off.  Click that fat one off.  No, that's, uh...  Let's see.  Huh?  The one next to it.  Right there.  Well, uh...  That one.  All right, Hootie McBoob. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  Hootie McBoob.  Hootie McBoob.  Um...  Could you just completely lose the shirt?  Um...  I guess.  Or are you...  Where?  Are you home?  Yeah, I'm home.  It's not a big deal.  I, uh...  Good.  Hold on a second.  Lose the shirt.  It'll make it more fun.  Hold on.  Oh, we're waiting.  Am I going to get, uh...  Am I going to get bounced for harassing the girls?  Who knows?  I'll probably get...  All right.  Take the bra off, too?  Yeah, very nice black bra we're looking at.  Hold on.  Yeah, might as well. 
[02:47:00]  All right.  This is going on live in the Opie and Anthony PalTalk room.  See, everybody now in the PalTalk is understanding how fun it is to be in the studio.  All right.  Because it's one of those things where you just go, ah, you know, just lose the shirt.  All right.  So far, so good, by the way.  And there, uh...  There we go.  Could you make her bigger?  Hootie McBoob.  Yes, I will, uh, make that a little bigger.  There we go.  Okay.  Now, um, we...  You have the phone, of course.  You're on the phone with us.  What you can't do, what you cannot do, is show us what you have in your pants before we guess. 
[02:47:30]  Okay.  Okay?  So, uh, you know how the game is played.  You'll rub the phone up and down, side to side, and in circles.  I don't know why.  On, uh, on your most intimate of, of areas.  Uh, hold, hold on, um, just a second.  Now, open her window.  Take that Discovery Channel window down.  Let me, uh, uh, uh, uh, I think, I think I saw something.  Were they panties?  Okay.  Yeah, she just ran away. 
[02:48:00]  Why'd she run away?  I hear people going, ugh, I'm fat, I'm not skinny.  No, no, we were looking at another camera.  No, there's, there's like five, we have five cameras up.  Get back on camera.  In five different rooms.  Yeah, sit down.  Sit down.  Why is Jimmy on this camp?  Oh, okay, no, I was looking at, uh, Jimmy Norton's camp.  Sit down, man.  We were talking about this disgusting porno that's also, uh, being played.  Yeah, don't worry.  No, you, you're wonderful.  You're fine.  There's a porno of a chick who just took her shirt off, which is awful.  We got, like, three different rooms open in here. 
[02:48:30]  There's video monitors.  That's right.  I got four of them open with different girls.  And we're constantly commenting on them.  Exactly.  Jesus, when does the baby do?  That's all.  See, there's a, uh.  You're fine.  No, see, there's a pregnant girl, uh, she's over there, so.  Right, there's Donkey Sausage, and then there's Lil.  Don't worry about it so much.  That's right.  Stop patting your belly.  You're very self-conscious, and you shouldn't be.  Not at all.  Don't you worry about it.  You're, uh. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, we're actually waiting for Opie to say something?  Yeah.  Let's not.  No, wait, let's just.  Uh, now, do you know how the game is played, Hootie?  Yes.  All right, you'll take the phone, rub it up and down.  Rub it against the fringe.  And then side to side, and then in a circular fashion on your pubic area.  But you can't let us see.  Is she gonna, but then she's gonna have to prove that, uh, she has what she said she has?  Yes, yes, by showing it.  Oh, that's just gonna be terrific.  So, what, can somebody maybe shut, uh, Opie's mic off?  Uh, and then we will, uh, see what you have and reveal it for everybody. 
[02:49:30]  That's gonna be fantastic.  Now, what we need you to do is rub up and down with the phone on your pubic area.  What about the jingle?  What about the jingle?  The guess what's in my pants jingle?  Steve worked really hard on that one.  Press that button down.  Which one?  You know the button I'm talking about.  This one?  Yeah.  All right.  The jingle leaves more time for you to fucking ruin this.  Okay, mister? 
[02:50:00]  I'm sorry.  Okay.  I'm not feeling too good about myself right now.  And, well, you shouldn't.  All right, back to the show.  It's time to play Who Guess What's In My Pants.  Okay, there's the jingle.  Oh, no, let's play the jingle.  I'll shut up.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  It's time to play.  No!  It's time to play.  No!  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my fridge?  No!  It's time to play.  Receiver.  Upon your Xbox. 
[02:50:30]  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my fridge?  Ah!  Ah!  What's in my fridge?  Ah!  My fridge.  Ah!  All right, we're ready to play.  I see the camera there is just about at belly level.  So that's good.  We won't see what you're doing.  And let's take the phone now and rub it up and down on your area.  If you would, please, Hootie McBoob.  All right. 
[02:51:00]  No, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Listen.  You're, um...  See, we...  You're cheating.  Ah!  You're rubbing on the outside of your pants.  How could that be helpful?  See, what we need...  What we need you to do...  See, we're watching this on Pal Talk right now.  Yeah.  What we...  How many girls have done this to us in the past, Ovi?  You don't rub it on...  What we need you to do is...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  What?  Another call coming in?  Oh, you're shit...  Is it Geico?  Domino's.  She's got a call waiting.  She took another call. 
[02:51:30]  Holy shit.  Can you answer the door?  We have eight pies.  All right.  Shut up.  All right.  That's okay.  Who was that, by the way, Hootie McBoob?  None of your business, Ovi.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Now, what we need you to do...  Wasn't Elaine Bryant.  Here's what we...  There's enough of my friends listening to this right now.  I'm going to get shit next week.  Don't worry about it.  No, you won't.  Now, you're cool.  You're lovely.  I need to explain to her exactly what she needs to do.  Hootie.  Why are you giving me the finger?  I said you're lovely.  Okay. 
[02:52:00]  I know.  I'm going to stick the phone in my pants.  No, no, no.  Here's what we need you to do, really.  This is going to be rough.  Is there a light on in your room?  No.  Oh.  Here's what we need you to do.  You actually have to move closer to the camera.  Move closer.  There we go.  Now, pull...  Yeah, so we can't even see anything but, like, your chest.  Now, pull your pants down.  That's so.  Pull your pants and panties down completely.  We won't see anything. 
[02:52:30]  Don't back up during this process.  Stay exactly where you are.  Just pull everything down.  Okay.  All right.  Now, take the phone and rub it on your nether region down there, up and down.  But don't back up.  Whatever you do.  I don't want to hear that beeping noise.  All right.  That's good.  See, that told us a little more.  Could you do that again?  I was laughing.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  Very good.  Very good.  Now, if you would take the phone and...  What happened?  Why are you bending over?  Twinkie down there.  If you would take the phone and move it side to side on the same region.  Side to side.  What are you putting on?  I'm putting...  I have to go to work.  I'm putting my clothes back on.  No, no.  You need the clothes off because we have to see...  Holy Jesus Christ.  Wait.  You have...  All right.  I'll do it again.  Hold on.  All right.  Wait.  All right.  Now, you got to do it in a...  A circular motion?  Yeah.  Now, do it in a circular motion. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  Now, don't put your clothes on yet.  Stay exactly where you are.  Don't get dressed.  Don't get dressed.  I see you getting dressed.  Don't get dressed yet.  Now, what you have...  We have to guess what she has in her pants.  Don't move.  Hold on.  You never gave the choices.  The choices...  I am giving the choices.  Okay.  Well, the first one is the Pavarotti.  That's where it's like a full lot of hair.  Like a beard.  It would be the Pavarotti.  Right.  And the second one is the Oliver Hardy mustache.  Right.  We call it the Oliver Hardy mustache, which is very thin. 
[02:54:00]  Yes.  Small.  Almost like a Hitler mustache, but only like Oliver Hardy.  And the last is our favorite, the Brando from Apocalypse Now, which is completely bald.  The Brando would be completely bald.  But we also have the entire Mohegan tribe, which is the little landing strip.  Or actually, what's the airport in Chicago?  O'Hare.  O'Hare.  Or the O'Hare, which is the landing strip at the busiest and largest of all airports that 
[02:54:30]  we love.  So, I'm going to guess full triangle.  Now, Opie, what's your guess?  Don't do anything yet there, Hootie.  Uh, your guess, Opie?  Uh, completely shaved.  All right.  He's saying, uh, uh, the, uh, completely shaved wood floor.  Uh, Jimmy, your guess?  I'm going to go with the full triangle because she put her thumb up after you said it.  All right.  Yeah, way to go.  Full triangle.  Oh, wait, I'm on delay.  Now, why are you getting dressed, letter? 
[02:55:00]  Okay, listen.  Now, what you have to do, Hootie.  Hootie, are you listening?  I'm listening to you, Anthony.  What you have to do now, I, and I hope for your sake, you did not put your pants back  on.  No, I did not.  All right, slowly back up and reveal to us what you have in your pants.  We've got to see Bush.  Keep it in.  Keep going.  Oh, no.  Well, you've got to put the camera down below that sack of, uh, what happened?  What happened?  No, I don't know what happened. 
[02:55:30]  It just cracked out on me.  Your camera threw up?  Your camera's crashed.  My camera threw up because I'm a fat fucking bitch.  No, no.  We're having technical glitches.  Don't worry.  Oh, I thought my internal thoughts just spook out.  I'm sorry.  The camera didn't have enough bites.  Hold on.  Shut up.  Quick, do a memory upgrade on your laptop.  Fuck, what's her name?  I can't get her camera.  Where'd she go?  She's not on. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, she should have picked the cuter girl.  It's okay.  No, she's terrific.  No, no, it's fine.  I've been here, you guys, since the very beginning.  You look good.  Did Doug bounce her right before she showed her gas?  No, you gotta, hey, listen, body like Ben Sparks, you gotta pull back and let us see  the whole thing.  Let us see the veg.  Doug bounced her.  I can't get back in the room.  The room is bogged.  That son of a fucking bitch.  I have to go to work, so.  Oh.  Where do you work?  What kind of place?  I cook for a living. 
[02:56:30]  I have to go.  You cook?  All right, now I gotta tell you what's going on here.  Doug, uh, dug out Doug is writing over and over again in the pal talk room.  Fuck you, Opie, for hanging up on my, uh, phone call or hanging up on me earlier.  He wanted in on the show and what he had for the program sucked so bad that I just hung  up on him.  So he's getting us back by doing that today.  Thank you, Doug.  That was a nice one.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Hootie McBoob.  Yes.  All right.  Good job.  And what did you, yeah, what did you have in your pants? 
[02:57:00]  I have a landing strip.  Oh, a landing strip.  Yeah, which I had, they had showed last night.  All right.  Wow, usually we're really excited at this.  Well, thank you very much, Hootie.  Hootie, no, don't, like, don't be discouraged to nature.  Hootie, yeah.  You knew what Norton was saying?  I didn't hear a word Norton was saying.  You know, the camera adds some pounds.  Hey, I'm not skinny and I don't pretend to be.  That's true.  We love you, Hootie.  The camera does add pounds.  Apparently you have nine cameras on you. 
[02:57:30]  You're so funny.  Hootie.  I didn't say it.  No, no, no.  I get in enough trouble for the stuff I say.  That was Jim Norton.  That's okay.  Jimmy Norton.  Who did it hurt when Comet Shoemaker-Levy hit you?  I'll take me out, gentlemen.  Have a great day.  Have a great day.  All right.  Thank you very much, Hootie.  Thank you.  And thanks for playing Guess What's in My Pants.  He's time to play.  He's time to play.  He's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants? 
[02:58:00]  Place the receiver upon your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess what's in my pants?  My pants.  Can I say I'd like to thank Donkey Sausage for that contribution?  And I'd also like to thank Liberace for the semen sample.  We're now getting the reason she had to leave so quickly.  Why?  She did have a landing strip, and a 747 was coming in. 
[02:58:30]  That or a canned ham.  Donkey Sausage.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  I swear to God, I'm sorry.  I had no idea that it was going to be awful from the breast down.  I thought that was a fine first installment of video.  Guess what's in my pants?  That was a great body.  She should have been moving her hands and singing Cece Ryder.  Oh, Jesus.  We had a couple other girls, but she was the first one that bit. 
[02:59:00]  Of course.  Good terminology.  Donkey Sausage is like the madam of the Pal Talk room.  Yes, you can call me the Inge Fisher of Pal Talk.  Right now she's outside her apartment helping some creep load a couch into his van.  Wait, are you about a size 37?  All right, we've got to take a break.  Thank you, Donkey Sausage.  You're welcome.  Have a happy new year.  You too, man.  Okay.  We've got to get Eddie K. Thomas in here. 
[02:59:30]  We've got to take a break.  We've been on the air for like an hour.  Drew Boogie, can you play us out for a little bit, and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  We'll be right back. 
[03:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:01:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, that's strong.  Lance of California, what's up?  It's chilling out here. It's cold.  Hey, Lance, start over. I know what happened to you.  I ain't doing nothing much, bro. It's just out here in Haywood. It's cold as hell.  It's cold as hell?  Yeah.  In Haywood?  Yeah, Haywood.  Not outside Jablomi?  Ha-ha. 
[03:02:30]  See, that's the old...  So what do you got for the show, Lance?  I dig the show. I just got my XM radio.  Lance!  Just a flair!  Just a flair!  You just got the XM?  Yeah.  Why don't you put this pontoon up her ass?  Well, listen to 202 tomorrow and all weekend long to do a little catch-up as far as the Opie and Anthony show goes, okay?  Okay.  All right, thanks, Lance.  All right, right on.  All I wanted to say was he just got his XM for Christmas, and he loves the show already. That's pretty nice. 
[03:03:00]  Mm-hmm.  We got to say hi to Eddie K. Thomas, man. He's in studio.  Hello.  What's up, Eddie?  Oh, there's a voice.  You were enjoying the pal talk, the boobs, the...  Is that what that was? That was pal talk?  Yeah, we got...  I just saw breasts.  We got webcams all over the place now. We got one in the studio, and then, like, listeners have theirs at home, and we're looking at them, they're looking at us.  I hope I didn't stop that.  No, not at all.  No, you're kind of, like, on it now.  I'm not that interesting as it was before. 
[03:03:30]  Nah.  Nah.  It's fine.  Nah.  It's the future. It's the internet. You know, you ever hear of that thing?  I love the future.  The internet.  I love the future.  It's this new thing all the kids are talking about.  Seems like it works.  I just did the stupidest thing, by the way. I met Eddie for the first time, and I go, I loved you in American Pie.  Why is that stupid?  Because you've... I honestly, I'll be...  What the hell am I doing here? Isn't that why I'm sitting here?  I thought that was the only movie you did, right?  Ah, well, you know.  You've been doing movies a really long... How old are you?  I'm now 25 years old. 
[03:04:00]  But look at his... Look at how many films he's been in.  People don't watch those movies.  No one saw Sweet Freaking Daisies?  Well, that was a short film.  There's other ones that people were supposed to see that they just didn't go see.  Freddy Got Fingered?  Some people saw that.  What were you in Freddy Got Fingered?  I was Freddy.  Oh.  Hello.  Maybe if I saw the movie, I wouldn't have known it.  That's one person who didn't see it.  You got me so bad.  I was making believe I saw the movie and it was some obscure character where I go,  Oh, I don't remember you in that film. 
[03:04:30]  I was Freddy, but I was only in like four or five scenes.  Yeah.  I got Fingered.  More Dogs Than Bones.  That was with Whoopi Goldberg and Chaz Palminteri.  Oh, Jimmy's good friend, Chaz Palminteri.  And still no one saw it.  I was going to say, see, when you got that offer, you're thinking, huge hit, right?  Yeah.  Well, no.  No?  I mean, it was a small film.  I'm a dog catcher in that. 
[03:05:00]  I don't know if it's even possible to see that.  Some of those movies you can go see, people just choose not to.  Not to?  How about like Brutally Normal?  That was a television series.  Oh, what?  Who was in that?  That no one saw.  Me.  And who else?  Mike Davis and Leah Moreno.  I don't know those people.  I like that you're having fun with this because there are guys that come in here and we see  some of this stuff and we're like, wow, man.  There's some stuff you know about.  Come on.  One of our jobs is to be up on pop culture and general movies, TV and stuff. 
[03:05:30]  Right.  So we'll see some of these bios and we'll go, what the hell was...  What else you got?  And they get mad at us.  No.  No, you were in black and white.  Some people saw that.  That was a good movie.  I saw that one.  That was a real good movie.  I actually saw that one.  What else was important in here?  You were in Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle.  I was Rosenberg.  That's right.  That's right.  Okay.  He's the Jew.  Now that's a funny movie.  There you go.  I like that movie. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  So some people see some things.  You know, you make 10 films and hopefully one of them...  But 50 Pills.  What was that about?  That hasn't come out yet.  Oh, okay.  That's a movie with Lou Taylor Pucci from that wonderful movie Thumbsucker.  No.  That's a movie about a kid who needs to sell 50 hits of ecstasy in order to pay his tuition.  And I'm one of his customers and I'm obsessed with different strokes and I take five hits ecstasy and... 
[03:06:30]  Different strokes, the TV show.  There's only one different strokes.  Well, there are different strokes for different folks.  Three bars.  But, yeah.  You know.  Obsessed with it.  In what way?  Do you just have to...  Can't miss an episode?  Yeah.  I mean, you know, some people are obsessed with the Opie and Anthony show and some with different strokes.  And some people are obsessed with American Pie because there's...  Some are obsessed with American Pie.  American Pie, American Pie 2, then it was the American Wedding or whatever.  And now they're doing Bandcamp, right? 
[03:07:00]  They did it.  It's out.  Are you in that one?  No.  Smart move.  I didn't know.  They didn't ask me.  Smart.  Yeah.  It was a career decision.  Is that the rest of the video?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Smart move.  Yeah, I wasn't going to be involved.  No, they didn't...  It was time to get off that train.  I...  You did well.  I wasn't offered a token to that train.  It was...  No, I wasn't offered a token.  They just...  They made it and, you know, they...  You know, people were saying, oh, there's American Pie 4 and I was like, no, there's not.  I mean, they would have told me about it. 
[03:07:30]  And then I found out they weren't lying and it was real.  They're just trying to keep the budget down, right?  Uh, yeah, because I'm real expensive to be...  Well, you probably would have been there to get a little more money to put me in front  of the camera.  It wasn't in any movie and wasn't in any of the American Pie movies.  They got, uh, Eugene Levy in that one, I believe.  Yeah.  But...  Yeah.  Eugene Levy.  Jesus Christ, he's in every fucking movie that's coming out now.  It's, uh, it's amazing.  It's annoying is what it is.  And then what about Natasha Lyonne?  Have you heard from her? 
[03:08:00]  No, I just read the gossip columns.  That's all I do, too.  We had, uh...  All day.  It's, I buy the paper.  We had her landlord on and she didn't, uh, she...  Did you really have her landlord?  Uh, yeah.  Oh, right.  And he didn't want to talk about it.  But it sounds like she, uh, has fallen on something.  It's the curse of the American Pie movie now.  That's what they're saying.  Are we getting to that point already?  Well, it's only one person.  I'm doing it all right.  But she's like...  I'm doing obscure films that no one sees.  I'm trying to start that whole thing going, though.  Like the curse of the American Pie movie, just based on one person.  Uh, was there any signs when you were doing the movies with her? 
[03:08:30]  Because she, like, ended up living on the street and...  No, not at all, man.  I mean, she, uh...  I always thought she would do great playing Janis Joplin.  Yeah.  Um, but I don't know about living.  No, not at all.  I was, I was really shocked.  Not that I'm that, you know, I don't usually catch those things too quickly, you know.  Yeah.  Friends in high school that turned into junkies.  I didn't see that coming either.  You just saw them as fun people to hang out with.  Yeah, exactly.  Like they sleep standing up.  Exactly.  Um, but no, that's, that was crazy. 
[03:09:00]  I, how's she doing?  I haven't read anything.  Supposedly she's doing better.  Are you really?  Supposedly.  Where'd you hear that?  Wasn't she on the verge of death?  It was, that was the last thing I heard.  She was in a hospital bed, verge of death, didn't look like her.  Everyone that walked by looked in the door and gasped.  Like, you heard just these horrible stories, so, and, you know, it's the news, so they're sensationalizing everything.  Yeah.  Tara Reid?  Uh, see Tara?  I, I, I see her television show.  We love Tara Dice.  Terrible.  They canceled it, though.  You know, it was originally called Wild on Tara. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah.  They should have kept that.  They should have kept that show, because we had, uh, hours of fun with that one.  Is she really as knowledgeable as she comes off on the show?  Um, yeah, she's, that's Tara.  That's not an act.  Because, wow.  Because, wow.  When she would be, like, on, uh, uh, somewhere in Greece, uh, just waxing fantastic about the ruins.  Beautiful.  I, I never got that from a Discovery Channel show or anything. 
[03:10:00]  Only Tara could put Greece in that perspective.  It's, it's that network's, you know, gift to you.  It's just like, man, it's like old and stuff and the rocks are falling down.  It's just like, they didn't even try to put these buildings back up or nothing.  Another cigarette in a drink, please.  Notice she's got the, uh, Lucille Ball voice at, like, 25.  All right, let's go to the phone and say hi to John the Trucker.  John?  Yeah.  What's up, John?  Oh, not too much.  I just wanted to ask your guest there how it was working with Tom Green.  Oh, good old Tom Green. 
[03:10:30]  Uh, did, did you see the movie?  Were you one of the, one of the few?  I saw the movie.  Beautiful.  Uh, a lot of people saw that.  I think on cable.  Uh, Tom is, uh, you know,  Tom's, Tom's Tom Green.  He's actually, for as much of a lunatic as he is, he's, uh, he's that much of a chill guy.  And he wrote,  Roman, Tom Green has one testicle.  Wow, he couldn't really commit to that.  Roman, Tom Green's testicle was in Drew Barrymore's mouth. 
[03:11:00]  What?  Watch it now.  You are an asshole.  It's a bit that usually kills, uh.  Yeah, it worked too well this time.  The guy's delivery was so bad.  He couldn't really commit to the bit.  You need confidence doing the Ramone bit.  He didn't have it at all.  He's trying to know Ramone, he sounds like fucking Peter Brady singing.  Yeah.  Time to change.  Uh, Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  I saw Eddie in his play last night.  Dog sees God.  Holla.  Dog sees God is the play that we're promoting today?  That's what we're promoting.  All right. 
[03:11:30]  All right.  Screw the American pie crap, right?  That wasn't a planted collar?  That's real?  That's real.  Wow.  Wait, did you really see it?  Hold on, Mike.  We're going to call you out.  Did you see this play last night?  Absolutely did.  Uh, prove it.  Prove it?  All right, Eddie.  Tell me what kind of a kisser Martian logo green...  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I was only going to hint at that.  Oh, boy.  See?  Uh-oh.  And he, like, blows the load right there.  So that's the...  He saw it.  He saw it.  I really saw it.  He saw it.  Sounds hot.  Thanks for coming down, man.  All right.  Well, what's this play about? 
[03:12:00]  Dog Sees God.  Dog Sees God.  Um, the play opens.  The lights come up.  Uh...  By the way, the title is one of those things.  It's a palindrome.  That's right.  Yes.  I didn't know the name, but I knew it was something.  Palindrome.  It sure is.  Dog Sees God.  Everyone take a moment.  Picture it.  I'm spelling it with my fingertip.  Yeah.  Uh, I knew it was one of those things that you could do.  Uh, I'm Charlie Brown.  Uh, America's beloved, uh, character.  Um...  What the hell is that?  A cell phone is off in the room. 
[03:12:30]  Whose phone is that?  This is a professional show.  Who's calling you?  The gay men's health crisis?  You want to promote my play here.  This is so unprofessional.  Jeez, I know.  You really think this is a professional show?  I thought it was.  No.  These microphones look nice.  You might want to lower your expectations.  We're not even on the air.  Right.  Okay.  Well, let me feel like I'm promoting my show.  We're just going to make a video blog later.  Just humor me.  I hope that people download it.  All right.  Lights come up.  Lights come up.  That's what we should have done when we were fired for two years and couldn't do anything.  Just do it.  Make believe we were really on the air. 
[03:13:00]  A video blog?  Right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Dog sees God.  Dog sees God, which our friend the caller saw last night.  Charlie Brown, ten years later.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Snoopy's dead.  Snoopy's dead.  He got rabies.  Um, that's pretty funny.  And you're Charlie Brown.  Uh, and I'm Charlie Brown.  And I'm, uh, you know, my dog is gone, which is a damn shame.  How old is Charlie Brown ten years later?  Uh, he's like 16, 17.  He's in high school. 
[03:13:30]  Um, and, uh, he, uh, you know, we're just visiting these characters, uh, again, and everybody's,  uh, pretty fucked up, you know?  Uh, uh, you know.  Lucy, whore, slut.  Uh, Lucy's in, uh, uh, in a mental institution.  Uh, me and, me and her wanted to do, uh, Linus a favor, so we, we burnt her blanket.  Burned, uh, Linus's blanket.  Uh-huh.  Uh, and she got obsessed with fire and, uh, then, uh, got angry at the little red-headed  girl and set her hair on fire. 
[03:14:00]  Peppermint Patty?  Dyke?  Uh, Peppermint Patty is a hooah, uh, played by the very, very talented Kelly Garner.  You guys know who she is?  She's...  I know that name.  I know the name.  I'm sure you got internet.  If you load her up, she's, uh, incredibly...  If you load her up, we'll say, oh, that girl.  Um, she's actually, uh, she's worth to come see the show to see this girl perform.  She's, you know, never did a play before.  And she's just blowing audiences away every night.  And, uh, and she's gorgeous.  And, um...  Was she in, uh, The Aviator?  She was in The Aviator. 
[03:14:30]  Wow.  Bully, and, uh...  I saw her in Hometown Legend, I believe.  Oh, Bully.  Holy smoke.  Who was she in Bully?  She was the blue-haired girl.  Okay.  Super hot.  Super hot.  Yeah, she's beautiful.  Yeah, yeah.  Very, very nice.  You could see her in person at 111 East 15th Street at 8 o'clock every night.  What's the name of the theater?  Uh, the Century Center for the Performing Arts.  Um, but it's actually a really cool show.  We also got, uh, Eliza Dushku, uh, in there.  Uh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  She's, she's not ugly.  No. 
[03:15:00]  No.  And we've heard of her.  Uh, yes.  That's true.  She's in movies that people see.  Uh, and, uh...  What does she do?  She's Lucy.  She's Lucy?  She's, she's, she's a perfect Lucy.  She's a genius.  Um, and, uh, yeah, it's, it's a really fun show, man.  People are really digging it.  It's a great concept.  The whole gang ten years later.  That's, I like that idea.  Yeah, and you know, the writer did it really smart.  What is Eliza Dushku doing right now?  Right now?  I'd say she's sleeping.  Uh, she could have been here. 
[03:15:30]  She could have been here.  Helping promote the show.  Well, I'm doing this.  I'm doing pictures with all of us.  But she got me.  Making us look that much taller.  Nothing against you, my friend.  I'm young.  Nothing at all.  I'm in dog sees gods.  Right?  Who's Eliza Dushku?  But she get, shut up, turn around, she's made our wall, you fucking idiots.  Which one is she?  She's over there.  Hello.  That's her.  She's cute.  Uh, come to the Century Center.  She's in a very short blue dress and fishnets.  They wear the same type of clothing?  Does Charlie Brown still wear the... 
[03:16:00]  I'm the only one who's, uh, still in the same exact clothing.  In the sweater?  Uh, it's, it's actually a polo shirt.  It's a polo shirt.  It's a polo shirt.  With the zigzags.  The zigzags turned into an EKG.  Uh, and, uh, Eliza's, her blue dress is now like a blue slip with fishnet stockings.  Holla.  Holla.  Nice.  All right, let's go to, uh, Photoshop Mike.  Mike, what's going on today?  Hey, guys.  I saw this show a few weeks ago.  Yeah.  It's a really, really good show.  I mean, I was, I was, I enjoyed it a lot.  And it actually brought a lump to my throat at certain points in the, in the show. 
[03:16:30]  I mean...  Thanks, man.  No, no, I mean, it was, it was, it was moving.  It was very touching.  And Anthony, you know who's in the show also?  The girl from, uh, the Comfy Pants show, the movie there.  Uh, Comfy Pants?  Well, the girl...  Considering no one saw that movie in studio, you might want to help us out.  It looks like you see all the, uh, tearjerkers.  The, the traveling pants...  Oh, America Ferreira.  That's it, America Ferreira.  You saw the Comfy Pants movie?  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  Where'd you get Comfy Pants? 
[03:17:00]  We called it the Comfy Pants.  The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.  We called it the Comfy Pants movie.  Which seems like the ultimate dopey chick flick.  But it was a great performance, so I...  Wait, why did you see the Comfy Pants movie?  Well, you guys were talking about it a few weeks ago.  I said, I got...  Your girlfriend made you, right?  I still, I listen, all right?  It was...  Boyfriend.  Great, great, great.  Is it a good movie?  It was all right.  It was pretty good.  I mean, this show was better, though.  Why is the Comfy Pants movie a good movie?  It's the Traveling Pants movie.  Tell us why it's a good movie.  I see lots and lots of movies, and just one of the ones that came, you know, along. 
[03:17:30]  So, you know, I didn't go out looking for it.  It just happened to come on, and that was it.  All the movies that are...  You're lying, sick of the shit.  Well, you guys apparently have seen this Comfy Pants movie, too, because they were talking about it.  Never saw it.  All I saw were the trailers for it, and it was like...  Yeah, I thought it was ridiculous.  Do you ever see a trailer for a movie and go, maybe not, because you're, you know, in the business?  Sure.  I look at...  Sometimes I look at a trailer and go, I am never, ever, ever seeing this movie.  It turns to the person you're going to the movie theater with and just go, skip it. 
[03:18:00]  It's just, you know, but not even like 20 years down the road, on cable, in flying cars, whatever we're doing, I still will not have seen that movie.  I just couldn't get past the...  Joy Luck Club, same thing.  I couldn't get past the fact that one of the girls was fat.  I'm like, how is she going to get into the pants?  Is it that they all have the same pants?  Don't look at me.  I haven't seen the Comfy Pants.  I don't know about these Comfy Pants.  He knows!  I know America Ferreira is now in Dog Seas God, though. 
[03:18:30]  And she was in the pants, but now she's in Dog Seas God.  And she's very good in that.  She's great.  She plays Sally, my beautiful sister.  Sally.  Yeah, Sally.  It's nice to, like, talk about these characters, right?  You remember them in a brief morph.  I remember them all in a smoking pot and having sex.  He got rabies.  He got rabies.  And he ate Woodstock.  He ate Woodstock after getting rabies.  Yeah.  So that's it.  Oh.  And now, you know, it's...  And it's sad.  You know, like the guy said, Wonderful Caller, it's a very, very funny play, but it's actually... 
[03:19:00]  Because Charlie Brown, it's very tragic.  Like, I didn't read him that much, but you go back and read these things.  Yeah, he was a sad guy.  He was sad, and, like, Schultz was putting in all this really profound stuff into these strips.  He was a pill popper.  Was he really?  I think so.  Pill popper.  He was depressed.  That's 1950s lingo.  What?  But he was a pill popper.  He was, probably.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But he was...  I just think so.  He's just making that up.  He was a real, like, sick...  He was putting all this crazy shit into these strips, though, you know?  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  And it's in the show, you know?  It's, you know...  I never see, because I just read Marmaduke.  It's a scream.  The family circus.  Jimmy loves it.  The family circus.  Yeah, Marmaduke.  He's always clumsy.  And he's so big.  And what are you going to do?  You'll love him.  Do you guys work in the kicking of the football?  It's mentioned quickly.  I can kick a football now.  That would be funny if she was holding it, pulled it away as usual, and you just kicked  they're in the cunt. 
[03:20:00]  No?  I'll pitch it tonight.  End scene.  Maybe for the director's cunt.  Fantastic.  Well, when is that now?  Every night?  Yeah, that's...  Every night?  Eight times a week.  Eight times a week.  I'm going to do it tonight.  I did it last night.  You show people.  How does someone like myself go?  I want to go to...  You give me a call.  Honestly, please come.  It's a very entertaining show.  Can I have your cell phone?  No.  I need more Hollywood fans.  I got people. 
[03:20:30]  You know, people that handle these movies.  That's where the line is drawn in show business, Opie.  We found it right there.  No.  And it's like an XM rap, like we're pretending to be friends.  No, I thought we were going to ask.  But this time I was feeling it, and I was thinking, all right, I'm, you know, cell phone,  maybe a burger after the show.  No.  Yeah, I was pretending now, but I had no intentions of really...  No, I don't think it at all.  It was fun, though, because you know, you're on a show, and you're like, oh, yeah, we're  all buddies, we're chatting.  Isn't it the weirdest thing, though, when you do these things?  It's so dumb. 
[03:21:00]  Well, I got to act like I really know the show and these guys for 15, 20 minutes, and then  who the fuck cares about it?  The weirdest thing in the world is, I was so surprised, the first time I did a talk  show, and it was Conan, and he actually does talk.  Like, you know when they pan back, and they're going to commercial, and they lean in and say  something?  Yeah.  He actually, like, said something.  I'm like, this is real.  They actually, like, and apparently he makes up something to say every time.  What did he say to you?  I have no idea.  It was something completely obscure, but I was so shocked.  I was like, you could just pretend to talk to me. 
[03:21:30]  All you would have to do to every single guest is lean over and go, uh, the camera's backing  away, and we just have to make it look like we're having a conversation.  That's what I thought he was going to do, but they actually, you know, play it for real.  I love Conan, but he's got to lower his seat.  It's getting ridiculous.  He's just a large man.  He is very tall.  He's like 7'4".  They all do it.  Where the hosts, you know, Letterman, Leno, O'Brien, they have to be a lot higher than  the guests.  So you feel below them.  But the Conan thing is ridiculous.  You're looking straight up at him like a little kid when you're on that show, it seems. 
[03:22:00]  Well, Letterman's also 6' something, isn't he?  He's like over 6 feet.  Yeah.  I haven't been on Letterman.  I mean, either.  No?  12, 30 shows.  He's been on Leno.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A few times.  He kills.  We hate him, though.  He's a big star.  He's down inside.  Big star?  He's going to point him back out to L.A. to do his HBO show.  Holla.  Stand-up comedy?  No, that's old hat for him.  Oh.  Now it's a TV series.  Oh, the stand-up's turned into sitcom.  He's still doing comedy for now.  Have you heard of a little show called Deadwood? 
[03:22:30]  Oh, hello.  He's not on that, but he's on that one.  He's going to be on the same network.  Right, right, right.  Sopranos?  Yeah.  I heard of that, same HBO that runs those programs.  Actually, right after Entourage, my friend.  Beautiful.  He's got a good spot and everything.  The little show got a big buzz.  It was called Rome.  Okay.  And I've been watching that and stuff, and that I'm sure will be around the time your show  is on.  You're not on Rome, either.  No.  No.  It might be part of the Rome sandwich that they do to promote the new HBO show.  Yeah, maybe they'll have a new thing connected. 
[03:23:00]  I'd love to see some kind of Caligula-like lard fist go up his ass.  You and me both.  All right.  The big plug, Eddie.  The big plug.  Dog Sees God.  Liza Dushku.  Eddie K.  Thomas.  Ian Somerhalder from Lost.  I don't know if you guys know that.  Yes, of course.  He's gorgeous.  Is he?  And, yeah, please come down.  It's a really, really fun show.  People are digging it.  How do you get tickets?  Do you show up? 
[03:23:30]  You go online, dogseesgod.com.  I think Ticketmaster handles it.  You can spell that backwards, too, if you want.  How did you get that one?  How did I get what?  That website.  I didn't do anything.  Oh.  I just say the lines that tell me to say.  By you, I mean the collective you people that are even on this show.  Like, I would say that to the lighting guy.  How did you get that one knowing he didn't, he wasn't typing domain name, fuck it, take it.  And then after asking it and your response, I realized, it's a dumbass question anyway.  I have nothing to offer.  I could just make up some complete bullshit right now, and it would mean absolutely nothing. 
[03:24:00]  We ought to buy it from a guy.  But I'll say it again, dogseesgod.com.  Or Ticketmaster, you know, we're a real show.  We're involved with these big companies.  How about this number?  212-239-6200.  Holla.  That's 212-239-6200.  I really want to go see it.  You sound like a real radio announcer.  When I have to, I can do the radio thing, yes.  I think you guys might be professionals.  I tend to feel real professionalism for a couple of minutes a day.  And then we go back to poopy jokes. 
[03:24:30]  Are you going to see more breasts today?  There's a porno going on right here.  Right now, it's, what the hell is going on?  It's a porno.  It's a guy, he's railing a girl in the ass.  But it looks like a garbage pail is between them.  I don't know what's going on.  That's a shame.  Yeah.  There's stuff.  It's love.  There's some craziness going on on Pal Talk.  I wish one of the girls would, we have a celebrity guest.  Oh, anal beads.  Sorry.  It's anal beads. 
[03:25:00]  I've just been informed.  Thank you.  Who would enjoy that?  Yeah, show Eddie that mess.  Here you go.  This is what happens when I show you.  There's Pal Talk, and that's what it's all about right there.  Is that happening right now?  Oh, my God.  Those are click clacks.  She's pulling bowling balls out of her ass.  Are all these girls friends of ours?  Enjoy, Eddie.  Three left off.  Wow.  Hi, ladies.  Yeah, the ones that are live right now, wave to Eddie.  See?  There you go.  That's live.  Hello.  Good morning. 
[03:25:30]  This is fun.  What do you like?  Do you see anything?  Is that going on there?  I'm seeing plenty.  They'll show you something.  Could somebody flash our celebrity guest?  It's embarrassing.  I think the brunette was the one I wanted to flash.  Isn't that great?  Thank you, ladies.  There you go.  The blonde's fantastic, too.  This is what you do?  This is it.  Isn't this ridiculous?  Keep it quiet.  Don't tell our bosses.  I do the same stupid play every night.  This is great.  Wow.  All right.  It's Eddie K. Thomas.  We're going to take a break.  Eddie, thank you. 
[03:26:00]  Thanks for having me, guys.  Continues to success there.  Please come down and check it out.  It's a wonderful play.  All right.  And we'll go to break with some Drew Boogie.  You ready, Drew, or no?  No, I ain't ready.  You ain't ready.  Drew, what are you doing?  Oh, my God.  Take it, man.  Talk about unprofessional.  XM2 on town.  The OPN Anthony Show. 
[03:26:30]  Drew Boogie, everyone. 
[03:27:00]  Bravo.  Drew, thanks for stopping by again.  Greatly appreciate that.  We're on our best behavior because Long Island Press is here.  They're going to do an interview after the show, right?  Yep.  You seem real excited to be interviewing us.  I'm very excited, actually.  Yeah.  Get on mic for a second.  A little mic.  We'll do a little pre-interview interview.  We haven't done an interview in, God, it has to be five days.  At least. 
[03:27:30]  I am excited.  I was a big fan of the show before you guys went off to satellite.  What's the big question you're going to ask us today?  Well, just say it.  The big one.  You guys did this first.  And, you know, the other guy's yelling and screaming that he's going to change the world.  So.  That's true.  So the angle is that we're the first to satellite radio.  We've been here.  This is old hat to us already.  This is old hat to you.  We know this satellite thing.  He says he's going to change the world.  We've been with the company a year and a half already.  Yep. 
[03:28:00]  Yep.  There you go.  And, yeah, we're the pioneers.  You know how many subscribers there were when we first got here?  No.  Probably, what, a little over 2 million?  Call it 2 to 2.2 million.  2.2.  You know how many there are now?  About 6 million.  We're working on about 6 million.  And all of those additions, by the way, are directly related to us being here.  That's right.  Make sure that's a radio.  Because that's what Howard's people are saying.  Right.  Because everybody that's bought a radio for the other company from the time Howard announced  like 14 months ago until now is directly because of Howard. 
[03:28:30]  Of course.  And that's the way they're spinning it.  So we brought in, I don't know, 4 million people.  Yeah, let's call it 4 million.  4 million.  I'd say all that because people assumed you were going there first.  Right.  So I think they were about 1 million.  People heard rumors.  So it's actually 5.2 million.  Yeah.  When he announced, I think they were about, they were less than a million.  Yeah.  It was like 600,000.  600,000.  Yeah.  And, you know, now they say they're at about 3 million.  Right.  But that's because the company was growing just like our company was growing. 
[03:29:00]  Just like satellite radio.  You know, and I heard, I downloaded off, I guess, Foundry.  Oh, that must have been tough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's real tough to find you guys on the internet still.  You guys going off.  He played that tape about how he would never hurt anybody, never take money out of their pocket.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And I could hear your head exploding.  I could hear you.  My head exploded because he did some real nasty shit that we'll get into for you, my friend.  For the Long Island Press. 
[03:29:30]  Especially if you put us on the cover.  You made him change headphones?  Yeah, I don't know why.  Did you give him the homeless guy headphones?  Was that the reason?  No, that's just so if there's a communique, he doesn't get all flustered.  Oh, okay.  He's being split from the same genre.  He's comfortable, I can tell.  I'm all right with it.  And he's got one of those voices.  You do radio or something?  I have done radio, yes.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I have done radio.  And we had one of those for a couple of years.  My friend and I had one of those brokered shows out on the island for a while, too.  At the BAB place?  Well, not at BAB, actually.  We did LIE, and then we actually were broadcasting it. 
[03:30:00]  We did an FM simulcast on 98.5 The Bone.  What was your show?  It was music.  We did a lot of original.  We focused on the original bands from the island.  You know who another Bone alumni is?  Who's that?  Our own Than.  Than worked there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  There you go, man.  You did a show about Long Island bands?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That list dries up fast, though.  Real fast.  Yeah.  Zebra.  No, no, no.  We didn't do it.  Yeah, we...  Joan Jett.  Believe it or not.  Billy Joel, Twisted Sister, the... 
[03:30:30]  We never mentioned the Good Rats.  We never mentioned any of those clowns, no.  It was more like, you know, the guys who are doing what they do now, you know?  Who's that?  There's a lot of, like, you'd be surprised.  There's a tremendous amount of original music out on the island.  What's the biggest band right now on Long Island?  There's a guy named, what's his name, Rory Lowe.  He's done a hell of a lot of work.  He's doing good stuff.  I know.  You know what?  Actually, I'll tell this story while I'm on the air.  You guys jerked me off on the air so bad once.  I was on the...  Nice.  Welcome.  I was in PR for a long time. 
[03:31:00]  Puerto Rico?  Yeah.  And I somehow got the assignment of trying to put Steve Guttenberg on your air.  Oh, man.  So I called up Rick, and I got passed around and passed around, and then after five minutes  realized, you guys have me on the air jerking me off so bad.  Oh, really?  Oh, that was awesome.  Oh, Guttenberg.  Didn't he die?  You know, all this shit.  And then I recognized Ant's voice, and I said, oh, man.  Yikes.  Yeah. 
[03:31:30]  We've got to play some of those.  Remember the porno runaround?  Oh, man.  I don't know if I have any of those right now.  I was a big fan of the show, guys, before you guys got yanked off.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Well, we're back doing it.  You got the satellite radio?  No, not yet.  I haven't made a...  I haven't gone either way yet.  Haven't gone either way yet.  See, now you got it.  Now we're only going to give you about five minutes after the show.  There was one bit that I laughed so hard.  You had the guy, the girl with the knives.  Remember the guy was putting the knives?  Oh, yeah.  And then you broke in.  You're listening to the sound.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:32:00]  Holy shit, that was hilarious.  She got off by having knives dragged on her.  Dragged on her, yes.  And I've been on your...  I just can never get over those pictures of you and the celebrities on your website.  Oh, thank you.  I've been on it a hundred times.  There's so many.  It just cracks me up, man.  Every day there's a new one.  New at Anna does today.  Now, what is the Long Island Press?  Long Island Press is a weekly now.  It started out...  What was it originally called?  It was the...  They actually bought the Island Year, turned into the New Island Year, and then two, three  years ago they changed it to the Long Island Press.  I remember that.  They bought that old... 
[03:32:30]  Amy Fisher was riding for that.  Yeah, she just stopped riding.  She stopped riding, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, she just stopped riding.  Oh, really?  She would do a cute column.  I read the Long Island Press.  Yeah.  Is she seeing anyone?  Yeah, she's married.  Married.  Married with a couple of kids.  Married to a Joey Buttafuoco lookalike.  Yeah, kind of.  She lives a couple of doors down from my mom.  Really?  Yeah.  A little frightening.  Yeah, I'm a Long Island guy.  A lot of the stories you guys told, it was always very familiar.  Of course.  I'm sure they're enjoying this in Alabama right now.  I'm sure they are.  So we're going to do the interview with the Long Island Press right after the show.  We've got to wrap up. 
[03:33:00]  It's 30 seconds left here.  Drew Boogie, thanks.  Are you promoting anything?  No.  Yes.  Tower Theater, New Year's Eve.  Come.  Ticketmaster.  Jimmy, I will be at your show.  Thank you, Will.  Steve, at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia.  Me, Colin, and Voss.  We're going to have a lot of fun down there, okay?  Yes.  And I guess that's it.  We had a great year.  We've got some really, really good bits to play the next three days, so make sure you're  listening to 202.  All right?  Right.  With that, hey, man, thanks for everything.  It was a great year.
