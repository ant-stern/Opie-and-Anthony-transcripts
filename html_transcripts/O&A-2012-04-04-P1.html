<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The show began with a detailed, graphically descriptive viewing and discussion of the 1960s exploitation film *Mondo Topless*, featuring explicit commentary on the actresses' nudity and physical attributes, including named actresses like Babat and Darlene Gray.  Audio clips from the film and interviews with some of the actresses were played.  The discussion then veered towards the Republican presidential primary, with speculation on Mitt Romney and criticism of Rick Santorum.  The show returned to *Mondo Topless* with more clips and narration.  A segment comparing a "cheesy" scene from *Twister* ("Finger of God") with amateur tornado footage from Texas, featuring panicked exclamations like "Oh my god" and "Holy moly," followed.  The show then briefly revisited their "wrestler death clock," mentioning wrestlers like the Polish Hammer and Honky Tonk Man, interspersed with a humorous Elvis Presley clip and a mention of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination anniversary, including a call from a Steve from Bayshore known for his Elvis impersonations.

The next segment opened with a discussion of Hank Aaron's home run record, transitioning into a recounting of past controversial moments, including the "Nappy Headed Ho" incident and a conflict with a CBS executive.  A lengthy segment followed on the death of Chief Jay Strongbow, expanding into their running bit tracking wrestler deaths, including graphic anecdotes about Andre the Giant, Blackjack Mulligan, and Bobby Heenan, along with audio clips of wrestling matches and a caller detailing a controversial Chief Jay Strongbow match.  The conversation then shifted to Nicki Minaj's Sirius XM visit, featuring graphic and crude jokes about her physique.  Finally, the segment discussed a McDonald's employee's alleged Mega Millions lottery win and her hiding the ticket at work, concluding with further commentary on the story and a brief mention of Dr. Drew's "Celebrity Rehab."

The following segment began with discussions of Shifty Shellshock's coma and Dennis Rodman's drinking problem, referencing "Celebrity Rehab."  This led to a scathing critique of a Queen Latifah and Common movie,  featuring a humorous exchange with a physical therapist in the studio.  A caller, Roland, described his Bruce Springsteen concert experience, sparking discussions about photoshopping Roland with Springsteen, NFL jersey changes, Tim Tebow merchandise, and the WWE's casting of Randy Orton in a Marine movie. A cute video of a child and a Spider-Man piñata was briefly shown.  The segment included sexually explicit jokes about The Rock, commentary on a poorly made Tim Tebow jersey,  and a news story about an Irish priest accidentally playing gay porn during a children's event.  A Seinfeld gum clip was played.  Plans for a Cleveland show were mentioned, along with further discussion of the previously mentioned movie and Yoko Ono’s art.  James McCartney called in as a guest; Julian and Sean Lennon's careers were also discussed. The segment concluded with more sexually explicit jokes.

The final segment began with a profane anecdote about a chance encounter with Moe Howard.  The conversation transitioned to the Beatles' children, playing audio clips of their music (or lack thereof) and making disparaging remarks about their talent and Yoko Ono, accompanied by discussions of photos, including one allegedly showing someone at a Barry Manilow concert. A caller won a SiriusXM contest.  The show then moved to 911 calls about bad fast food, featuring a call about unsatisfactory Hardee's burgers.  Discussions about the hosts’ preferred ages and past relationships, interspersed with crude humor, followed.  A lengthy, vulgar discussion about hover-round commercials and the age of the Earth using the Grand Canyon as an example ensued. Videos and photos, including one of the Titanic and an exploding iceberg, were shown. The segment concluded with a recurring bit featuring "Bobo," who left increasingly bizarre and profane messages begging to be on the show, with the hosts interacting frequently with their sound engineers, E-Rock and Z-Rock, making fun of their work habits.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank you, sir.  That's the Mondo Topless guy. We haven't mentioned that in a while, huh?  Mondo Topless, one of the greatest films of all time.  If you like tits.  Tits.  What a... I gotta watch that again now.  Yeah.  Can we have a...  Could we watch the whole movie one day?  Mondo Topless. Do like a mystery science theater with Mondo Topless. 
[00:00:30]  You know one of those days when we know we're gonna take off, we'll just come in anyway and go,  Look, we weren't supposed to be here, and all we're gonna do is watch Mondo Topless,  and you could listen in if you feel like it.  Listen to us watching a movie.  And maybe we could even sync it up.  Exactly.  We could sync with the listeners, they could be watching at home, and we'll do some commentary.  Exactly.  Because Mondo Topless fucking ruled.  I don't even know why it ruled.  I don't see Favis Bardol.  Uh-huh.  Favis.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts. 
[00:01:00]  Speak to us, Babat, baby.  I try to project a childlike to a woman quality.  Jeez.  Because I do believe that men doesn't...  They're not like so much odd sex.  They like softness also.  Trained old bias.  She's half naked on the side.  Sexuality and also...  I love it.  She's dancing around with giant tits.  Giant tits.  Do you know how many guys have jerked off to this video?  Oh, my God.  Before 1970.  Oh.  Yeah, groovy.  She's just dancing in the desert next to a choo-choo. 
[00:01:30]  There's no point to this film.  No.  It was the way to show porn back then.  Wow.  Now she's taking off her...  And look at these torpedoes.  Fucking all natural, too.  Wow.  Look at these torpedoes.  Oh, my God.  Now she's wiggling them.  They are giant tits.  Those are giant natural Nordic tits.  Oh, Babat is lovely.  Babat.  Babat.  Babat, baby.  Babat, boy, go rules.  This was 1966?  Really?  She's sucking her thumb.  And then a little transistor radio. 
[00:02:00]  Is that the only clip?  Can we do one more clip?  I promise we won't do the whole fucking movie.  I promise the people.  Let's meet Lorna.  Lorna.  Without artistic surrender.  Without compromise.  Without question or apology.  An important motion picture was produced.  Lorna.  A woman too much for one man.  She's just walking a donkey.  Yeah.  The star was an incredibly voluptuous young actress.  The embodiment of physical allure.  Her name? 
[00:02:30]  Lorna Maitland.  She was chosen with the aid of the film you are now viewing from 132 applicants who responded  to an advertisement in daily variety.  Why is he saying this?  The film was completed and the film Lorna was released to the motion picture theaters.  Miss Maitland had reason to be proud of the results and is now looking forward to a long  and successful career as an actress.  An actress that she's walking away naked.  In the desert.  In the desert.  Conduction tape recorded comments from Lorna Maitland. 
[00:03:00]  Of course I didn't feel as though I was right for the part when we went for the interview.  I was dressed with a rather secretarial look to me I felt.  And I didn't get too much reaction from you.  I guess you see quite a few lovely girls.  Holy tits.  My manager is very persistent and he felt that I had a good chance in getting the picture.  So he insists on taking some pictures of me.  Isn't that lovely?  Fat nipples.  It feels a little bit more of my physical attributes you might say. 
[00:03:30]  In fact I think that was the reason for me being so relaxed and walking around.  Yes Lorna you cunt.  Modesty I guess you might say.  These are all the broads that want to be the next Marilyn Monroe.  Yeah yeah.  And instead they had to just be naked.  Lay naked in the desert.  They literally brought them out in the middle of the Mojave Desert.  That audio quality is sexy though.  Oh yeah.  It sounds old school right?  Oh yes.  I love it.  The way it's recorded.  It's fucking hot.  Good thing that the listeners can't see this with us. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah right.  Why would that be good?  Why would that be nice too?  I'm just thinking how much fun this should be to watch when we comment on.  Oh I know.  I'd be willing to take a rare visit live at the compound to watch this shit.  Why don't we do a Mondo Topless.  Mondo Topless live from the compound.  Why don't we do that?  Let's get Babette down there.  Let's find her.  Yeah.  How old is she?  Exactly.  Can you give us a good clip?  That clip was boring.  Babette just shit her pants. 
[00:04:30]  She's 103 years old baby.  Still sexy in her Depend undergarment.  Hair flattened by a satin pillow.  Wow.  This girl's just running around topless.  Darlene Gray.  Right.  They just found a lot of mud.  She's just running like a retard with her big tits bobbling.  Yeah she's doing like a 60's wacky Woodstock dance.  Trying to dance.  It's great.  They're giant.  They're giant.  At least.  Oh they're lovely tits. 
[00:05:00]  Natural double D's.  Jeans on.  Nothing up top with a little transistor radio.  She's holding a transistor.  They just did a cheap cutaway shot to the transistor.  It's terrible.  Oh the production sucks on this movie.  Oh man.  And there's no point.  They're just dancing and showing off their tits.  A little transistor.  This is before cassettes.  Oh yeah.  Before cassettes.  Before 8-tracks.  Yeah.  This is 1966.  Holy shit.  This must have been near where they did the blast. 
[00:05:30]  They're just fucking nuclear tits.  These girls got these fucking mutant tits.  This is Darlene Gray.  Darlene Gray.  I remember Darlene Gray.  I mean.  That's what.  That's porno back then.  Oh yeah.  Fucking chicks just shaking their giant tits.  There's an innocence to it.  Yeah there really is.  No big huge hairy muffs.  They're not shitting.  Right.  No dogs licking them.  Oh the good old days. 
[00:06:00]  Darlene Gray.  We did promise we wouldn't do too much of this.  We certainly did.  We break our promises a lot.  It's so tough not to play another clip though.  No.  No.  They're all right there.  Sam if you find a really good clip.  They're wonderful.  The best part of it is the announcer just loses his fucking mind.  Right right.  You know hearing bam bam bam bam as they're dancing doesn't really do much.  And he literally loses his mind describing the girls.  Oh he loves it.  And this was San Francisco right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah because at one point in the movie they're just driving around to all the landmarks topless. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah yeah.  All the San Francisco landmarks.  But then there's some double entendre.  Oh yeah.  That he discusses.  Bank of America.  Wow.  Oh god.  Like Koi Tower is all of a sudden a big fucking hard cock.  A cock.  And the tunnels.  Well you know what they are.  Rising.  All right.  Turgeon above the streets.  Oh yeah.  Can you get the opening and then we will go.  Yeah because this is just music.  Yeah the opening is great because it goes and shows all the landmarks in San Francisco. 
[00:07:00]  Talks about them as sexual objects.  No.  If you can Sam.  If not that's fine.  So Mitt Romney is going to be your nominee.  Yeah.  It's obvious.  I think it's been obvious.  Santorum and Gingrich and Ron Paul refuse to acknowledge that.  But Ron Paul is going to be in there to the end because he's got a message that is beyond  being president.  But Santorum refuses to drop and so does Gingrich.  Yeah.  They're kind of.  Everyone at this point is saying you got to just stop.  It's Romney's.  It's Romney's.  But they'll drop eventually and then they'll they'll they'll praise him. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah I know.  And that's why I hate all this shit.  What happened to you beating the shit out of them for the last year?  They're they're going to stick to it until they actually pick the candidate which is  stupid at this point.  It's unusual right.  I don't.  This doesn't happen that often though.  Yeah I mean you'll get a much better gauge of how he's going to do against Obama if  these two get out of the way and all of their people that you know vote for them in the  polls start voting for for Romney because that's what's going to happen in the polls. 
[00:08:00]  You're not going to get a lot of these Gingrich people going well I'm going to go Obama.  Right.  You know consolidation of the peeps man.  Yeah.  You're all home.  Who do you think he's going to pick as his running mate?  Is it Rubio?  I'll go Rubio.  It could be a few.  A little I know.  Options there.  Yeah you get a little of the minority vote and all that.  Oh wow.  You know the report and stuff.  Hey New York is a Democrat Democratic state. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  But the Republican people out there who do they like in New York you think because that's  next.  They're not going to put up with Santorum bullshit I would assume.  No.  I think Romney easily wins New York as far as the primary.  As far as primary.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Easily.  You're not going to get Santorum winning any.  We don't put up with Santorum shit in this state.  No.  I think people ought to really kind of get off his shit and just fucking really send him  a message that he's got to go.  Who's voting for this fucking guy?  I don't know man. 
[00:09:00]  I know one thing.  I don't like that guy.  No.  Right.  I don't like him.  I mean in the end if it's Romney whatever.  Whatever.  It's going to be Romney.  I mean.  He's the least douche at all.  No I mean if he wins the whole thing I'm like whatever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not a big supporter of either side.  Trust me.  But if it turns out to be Romney I'll be like whatever.  But Santorum he's scary.  That fucking guy's scary.  I don't like that religious.  Fuck that guy.  Yeah.  That heavy religious background as far as the candidate goes.  It's just not. 
[00:09:30]  Not good for the country.  No.  No.  Nah.  Nah.  People saying find the Pat Barrington clip.  Sam.  That's the one right.  Because we feel like we need just a little more.  Just need a little more of ham.  Just a little bit.  Fuck the music.  We got the Pat Barrington.  What don't I like about Obama?  Just taxes.  That really is all I don't like about him.  Just taxes.  He's pulling a lot of shenanigans.  I was talking to my guys.  Howard Grabs.  Obama gets reelected.  Let's get our ducks in order he's saying.  Why?  And that comment.  Taxes and stuff. 
[00:10:00]  That fucking under the breath Russian comment there.  I love it.  It's a little message.  I love it.  Because it shows they all bullshit in the end.  Well, you know what?  Keep your mouth shut.  And they're having these conversations when the mics are off.  You could have been lying to the Russian.  Right.  It's all bullshit.  Yeah.  I mean, it's his turn.  It beat him up for it.  Granted.  But, I mean, you got to acknowledge that they all do that shit.  Yeah.  They tell the public one thing and behind the scenes they're doing other shit.  Well, you know what?  That's fine.  I understand that. 
[00:10:30]  But what he's saying is pretty fucking outrageous.  Like, what kind of deal is he making with the Russians that he can't present until he  has no accountability anymore as president because he can't be reelected?  So, what is this thing he's presenting to the Russians where he's like, ah, I don't  want to do this until I'm reelected because they, you know.  Well, word on the street is the vodka supply is a little low in America right now.  Wodka?  It's something about the vodka? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, the vodka is a little low.  I thought strippers.  Russian strippers.  And, yeah, we could use a few more.  Well, I don't like the Russian strippers.  Yeah, they're all business is what it is.  It's very hard to get one that just wants to dance for the art.  For the art.  For the art of dancing.  I bet Pat Barrington would make you believe.  Pat Barrington.  Oh, boy.  You're just playing the music, E-Rock?  Yep.  Yeah.  I want the clip, though.  I like the guy's voice. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Pat Meyer.  You got Pat Barrington?  What do you got there?  Where's Pat Barrington?  Sam.  Sam, what do you got?  Who doesn't have Pat Barrington?  Sam.  Pat Barrington's not on here.  I see you're ready to click play.  What do you got there?  It's just his voice.  It's an intro.  Google Pat Barrington.  Is this the intro?  Is this the intro?  I think so.  This is the intro to Mondo Topless.  And then I promise, I personally promise we'll move on.  On with the way out craze of the Topless, formed and nurtured by staid and stolid San Francisco, 
[00:12:00]  and cut loose to rampage across the USA and even Europe.  National publications such as Life, Playboy, and Esquire have documented the Topless.  The phrase and the craze that is changing the mood and the mores of people everywhere.  Mondo Topless captures the basic quintessence of the movement.  With movement.  Way out wild movement.  Here, go-go girls, in and out of their environment, will be revealed to you in scenes that can only be summarized 
[00:12:30]  as a swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Mondo Topless is believably real in Eastman color.  But unbelievable just barely describes all of Russ Meyer's discotheque discoveries.  Fantastic women.  Fantastic dancers.  Featuring the world's loveliest Buxotics.  Buxotics.  Buxotics, right.  You would have dreamed there were women like these until now.  But they're real.  Unbelievably real in Mondo Topless. 
[00:13:00]  I love this guy.  Face your eyes on Fumptious Pat Barrington.  Buxotic Darlene Gray.  Luscious Cinlenae.  Delicious Dollar Paris.  Yummy Diane Young.  Exciting Donna X.  And bouncy Bavit Bardot.  Bavit.  Yes, for the very first time, you will hear actual on-the-spot recorded tapes consisting of sensitive comments and opinions  by the very topless dancers wildly gyrating before your eyes. 
[00:13:30]  That guy is so excited.  The world's wisdom based upon guarded personal experiences all played against a backdrop of  compestuous soul-stirring rock-and-roll music.  My best friend gives me a problem where I can't find a bathing suit to fit me.  When I'm doing the tablets, you have to have one custom made.  I feel I am alluring to a man with or without clothes, and I try to be, this is my main purpose in life.  I want at least four or five more children. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I think they come to layer at the dancers.  Even if it does excite them, this is good.  Certain dances they say aren't sexy, and I don't know how they can say that.  It's ridiculous.  And I have no bad thoughts.  It's a rule in my mind.  At least I don't think I do.  My dolls like to sleep in the raw.  It's more comfortable.  What do you need clothes for when you have covers to cover you anyway?  A big hairy pussy all over her sheets.  Yes, I guess you could say I'm sort of an exhibitionist.  And I enjoy being looked at and appreciated. 
[00:14:30]  You're a place like a horse.  More than most men.  It's a very strange thing.  Girls talked weird back then.  It was sexy though, man.  I've never had a problem.  You don't just say that sex is only for a man because now that's perfectly ridiculous.  I don't believe a woman should tease a man unless she's going to give him something.  Otherwise she shouldn't even bother to.  Exactly.  Don't even bother strip-teasing.  They're sexy girls, man.  The whole time it was nothing but a montage of topless girls. 
[00:15:00]  Shaking their tits.  With huge natural boobs.  To that rock and roll music.  Heck, put that on our Facebook page.  Oh no, you probably can't, right?  You get a little weird with that shit.  No, no, you can't.  Yeah, Sam, where do we go with this for the people out there?  It's on dailymotion.com.  If you just search Mondo Topless, you can find all the clips.  Fuck yeah.  Well, when I'm doing the topless.  The topless.  The topless.  I remember her.  That sounds like a time of fucking the 60s.  Oh, yes.  That's three years before Woodstock.  Doesn't that just sound like fucking and juiciness?  Fucking and socking. 
[00:15:30]  Where the fuck was this woman growing up?  This is all I would have needed.  Dude, if you saw those tits shaking like that.  Fuck trying to get Playboy magazines.  Come in your pants.  I would have had this for 10 years.  No problem.  Of course.  Where was it?  Oh, then again, we assume we forget.  No video.  You couldn't just put this on anywhere.  Oh.  This had to be like 8mm shit.  Had to be 8mm film.  You weren't getting sound.  What are you, in a fucking movie theater?  For a moment there, I thought we grew up with a computer.  I forgot. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I just forgot that we did not grow up with a computer.  Child of the 80s.  You had the Commodore 64, but you can't play those videos on it.  That's right.  So, wow.  You had to go to a theater to see this.  I'll tell you who was enjoying it.  It's Sammy.  Sammy.  Oh, boy, Sam.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'd pick up my big bell telephone, and I'd grab the handset, and ahead of my time, I would  literally take my finger and try to swipe it all over the receiver and try to move things 
[00:16:30]  around.  I didn't have any apps.  Jeez.  I was like, Mom, where can I get some apps?  And she gave me a shrimp cocktail.  We got chipped out of life, I'm thinking.  Well.  Because, man, the kids today.  The kids today.  Look what they got.  We didn't have this shit.  I used to have a little fantasy as a child that I would have a wristwatch with a television  in it so I could sit in class, in school, and watch cartoons and stuff and TV in, like, 
[00:17:00]  first grade, second grade, things like that.  Fantasy?  Why didn't you, like, write that down?  That's what ended up happening, basically.  You would have been a billionaire.  Oh, I should have patented that.  To you, it was like, oh, look at this dumb idea.  But guess what?  We're basically doing that.  Yeah, it's kind of Dick Tracy, though.  Strap your phone to your fucking wrist.  It's your idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  But now, you know, obviously the wristwatch thing, too small to view.  I thought it would be cool, but really too small to see. 
[00:17:30]  So you've got to go with an iPhone-type thing, at least, for size.  And I wasn't thinking of that.  When I thought of communication device that's handheld, I thought, you know, Star Trek communicator.  Right.  No real picture.  That was outrageous.  And that's what the tricorder was for.  Right.  And that was pretty big.  Boy, you'd think they just would have had an iPad or something like that in the Enterprise.  Not that big box that he carried around for the tricorder.  It sucked.  That does suck. 
[00:18:00]  I have my tricorder.  Captain.  My dentures are falling.  I have to go to McCoy and put my dentures back in.  I'm looking at the pic of the fucking track of trailers blowing through the sky.  Is that amazing?  Wow!  Whoa, Jimmy!  Yeah, that is amazing.  Some major fucking tornadoes.  Um, I don't know.  Were they, uh, F5s? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, shit.  Were they F5s?  Oh, shit.  Finger of God.  Finger of God.  Was that really a dramatic moment when he said that?  Oh, my God.  Oh, an F4.  I'll relocate your house pretty efficiently.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Is there such a thing as like an F5?  You bitch!  You mention an F5?  What's the Laquishie that I've seen?  Yes, that's a good one.  I've only seen it 300 times.  I know, but I have to see it now.  It's so terrible. 
[00:19:00]  Because it's so douchey.  Finger of God.  Ew.  Finger of God.  Ugh.  God's like, hey, what are you even asking for?  Is that Seymour Hoffman and Bill Paxton?  Yeah, but he's not the one that says it.  It's some other douchebag.  That was part of their, part of their big fucking tornado chase, storm chaser thing.  Was he douchey in it, Seymour Hoffman, too?  Everyone was douchey.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was a great actor, was the biggest douche.  It's why they called him the extreme! 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  He wasn't considered a great actor yet, was he?  No, this was fucking, he was just a...  This was before it all happened.  Yeah, yeah.  This was pre-Boogie Nights.  Even though that movie was a huge blockbuster success.  Oh, please.  The movie twisters about one of the most primordial forces on the face of the...  Ugh.  One of the most primordial forces on the face of the earth.  Watch but are in charge!  Bill Paxton.  We're doomed.  We might not find a good copy.  We're in some real pretty shit now! 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it looks like the only thing that comes up on YouTube for Finger of God is life in the compounds.  Oh, well, yeah.  Version of it.  I might have done a...  Okay!  Okay.  I want to hang out with him.  I want to hang out with him.  Yeah!  How'd you guys get in the movie?  I don't know.  It's amazing.  Bill's the extreme!  I'm an idiot.  No, it's okay, man.  It's a good house.  That is cool.  Dry your tears, man.  Dry your tears.  I'm an idiot, Jesus. 
[00:20:30]  Look at how much fun it is with the visual element.  I know.  I'm partying with the extreme people.  It's on the background on the green screen behind me.  And we're just having fun.  Yeah.  I don't know where the Finger of God...  Could take a while.  It's the entire movie.  Yeah, yeah.  But how much fun is that with the...  We've got to make some decisions.  Oh, that is where they went to dinner.  We've got to make decisions.  All right, okay, all right, I think you're there.  Your speech is coming up.  Yeah.  Green? 
[00:21:00]  It's my commentary.  And the Finger of Motherfucking God.  You're pumped.  I was pumped.  You've got a lot of beef.  Where's your logo backwards?  They put everything backwards when they post it on YouTube.  So, digitally, they can't detect it and say that you're infringing on someone's copyright.  Yes, that's why a lot of times we'll see NBC shows and whatnot reversed.  It's true.  All backwards.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, because you actually get a digital imprint of the movie, and that's how they catch you. 
[00:21:30]  It's not one guy that's just watching everything and screening everything.  So, you're just playing soccer.  Oh, I'm taking my shirt off and I bumped the idiot.  Let's see.  Play soccer.  How was he?  Is that Laura Dern?  No, that's the other one.  What's her name?  She's terrible.  Helen Hunt?  Helen Hunt with a giant forehead.  What?  No, she's terrible.  Go for hands.  She had a good run, but she's gone now.  Yeah, yeah.  She's awful.  Let's do this.  Come on. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, come on.  You gotta go forward.  Look at what we're going through to do this.  We haven't done anything yet on the show.  Keep going.  We gotta see extreme.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm talking imminent ruage.  Imminent ruage.  Why does he say that?  Because he's extreme.  What's ruage?  Did you hear that?  To rue the day.  They'll rue the day.  And he goes, imminent ruage.  I can't watch this.  It's so bad.  It's so bad.  Imminent ruage.  Keep going.  Keep going.  I've seen the extreme in high gear. 
[00:22:30]  You guys gotta get some new stories.  They're gonna boo the day.  Extreme booage.  Oh my God.  10 minutes.  That's good.  Oh my God.  It's way too close and Joe's got the vid on it.  She's filming it, right?  She's got the vid out of nowhere.  This shitty looking green valiant comes pulling up.  Oh boy, she has to get herself together.  Yeah.  How many times did she tell this?  She's gotta go upstairs.  She's got to go upstairs.  She stumbles out of the car.  She's got like a bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand.  Oh, it's extreme.  He is butt naked.  That's why it's extreme.  He's naked.  Not naked. 
[00:23:00]  He's naked with a bottle of Jack.  And there's a tornado coming.  Oh, I know how it's moving.  Forget this.  Half naked.  Uh, Cameron Frye.  So Joe's yelling at him to get out of the way, right?  Float in a parade.  Yeah.  He just, he strolls up to the twister.  That's it.  Oh, shit.  It's somewhere.  It's just terrible.  It's horrible.  Keep going.  It's freeze-framed, I guess.  I don't know where it is.  Evil Bill.  Evil Bill.  I killed him.  Let my kid.  Ah! 
[00:23:30]  Yeah!  Keep going.  I'm loving this.  It is really.  It's just so awful.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Float is good.  Float will relocate your house fairly efficiently.  Is there an F5?  Oh, shit.  The finger of God.  Shut up!  Shut the fuck up!  I'm all upset about it, I guess.  Oh, it's terrible.  Yeah.  You know how that should go?  Um, is there an F5?  Yeah, that one's really fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, uh, stronger.  Oh, just stop.  The fork falls. 
[00:24:00]  Someone couldn't even hold their fucking fork.  That's how crazy it was.  She mentioned an F5?  I lost all fucking muscular strength in my hands.  I can't even hold a fork.  An N5 would scare me more.  Oh, 5N.  Jay from Huntington on the Twitter.  The Twister ride at Universal Studios is more believable than that shit movie.  Very good.  Well, we had some tornadoes down there in Texas.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  All over Dallas, right?  Yeah, Dallas.  Near the airport, near where the Mavericks were practicing. 
[00:24:30]  Good old Dirk tweeted yesterday that...  Diggler?  Dirk Diggler.  He plays for the Mavs.  He tweeted that they couldn't leave the gym because tornadoes were all around the damn place.  How many people commented that it sounded like a freight train?  A lot, Ant.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Here's apparently what a tornado sounds like.  A lot.  Sounded like a train came up.  No, the one that goes around Disneyland.  Not a real one.  What kind of damage?  Do we know yet? 
[00:25:00]  Finger of God.  Yeah.  We all saw the video of, what, the tractor trailer?  I did not see it.  You haven't seen it yet?  I did not see it.  And they were explaining those things weigh a shitload, obviously.  Gotta be 30, 40 pounds.  Oh, no.  Thar!  Well, the problem is you're going to have to listen to Chad.  Chad?  We have played Chad on our show over the years.  Oh, Chad is the guy that got yelled at.  Chad loves weather.  He loves when a weather-related thing happens because he's the star.  Can we find the Chad clip where he had to scold the woman? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, that guy.  Was that Katrina?  I've never forgotten about Chad because he loves weather.  Dude, that is great.  I want to hear that really well.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  And, man, you've got to stay out of his fucking way because he'll scold you when he's talking about his weather.  And then he got scolded and looked like a bitch.  Yeah, so the clip we're about to play from the Tornadoes yesterday in Dallas, you have to listen to Chad.  Chad!  I fucking hate Chad.  We don't have a better version of that? 
[00:26:00]  I mean, not the...  We used to play a much better version of that, no?  I don't know if Eric has one.  Eric, you got one?  Eric's looking for it really quickly?  Yeah, CNN, right?  CNN, Chad.  I have the audio.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Let's give it a listen.  Oh, Iraq, my name.  But the storm was 902 billabars.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, Iraq.  Hold on a minute.  You've got to pause a lot.  This is...  What he's doing is he's explaining barometric pressure.  Right.  Which I know is exciting as fuck. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, it's a hoot.  It's great.  So they're on CNN.  Katrina's happening.  They want to fucking get, like, the drama and excitement.  It's the fucking news.  They don't want the weatherman talking about barometric pressure ad nauseum.  So he starts talking about it, and the anchor legitimately starts, like, this sucks.  Right.  So she gets involved.  But the storm was 902 billabars.  902 was the lowest that you had with this storm a couple of hours ago. 
[00:27:00]  So it has filled in a little bit, filled in with some air.  Sure.  That is lower pressure.  But Camille...  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  Why don't you translate that for us?  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk...  Achoo!  Camille...  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as strong as Camille, but not really as strong as it's been.  908.  I'm walking over here because you're...  I can have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  He lost it, too. 
[00:27:30]  908 millibars is 26.81 inches of mercury.  This storm got down to 26.61.  No one cares.  And right now it's 26.98.  Now, if you would go to your home barometer that you have, it's probably a big circle hanging  on your wall that you got from an uncle somewhere.  No one.  If you go look at that, that is completely off the screen.  She was totally just.  Does it ever have to have a barometer that would go that low in the northern hemisphere  unless you're obviously trying to get under a hurricane?  All right.  Thank you, Chad. 
[00:28:00]  All right.  Just having fun with you this morning.  You're not having fun with you.  No, no, that's right.  That was the one.  Just having fun with you.  No, you're fucking pissed off at Carol.  You were fucking pissed because she called you out on your borefest barometric pressure  diatribe.  And I hate to say it.  A lot of times the females are wrong in that situation.  Yeah.  But she was absolutely fucking correct.  Chad!  Hey, geek.  No one talks about millibars.  Fucking put your dick in your pants and your barometer away and fucking get some excitement  here.  Wind speed.  Whenever you're talking about hurricanes, how about some wind speeds, you motherfucker? 
[00:28:30]  That's all we need to know.  Where's the eye?  What's the storm track?  That's right.  But he also was saying that it's not as bad.  Like, he was actually giving news that she didn't want to hear.  Oh, that it wasn't as bad.  It was bad, but not as bad.  They don't want to hear that shit.  They want to hear it as good.  No, they want to hear the end of the world.  But the point being, you don't need to say it in millibars.  Oh, it's millibars.  Do you want to hear her part again?  Yeah.  Quickly.  That is lower frequency.  But Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean? 
[00:29:00]  If you would let me talk.  If you would let me talk.  Let me talk, Carol.  Carol.  Chad.  She's like, Chad, Chad, Chad.  She talked to him like a child.  Like, if she has a child at home, that's exactly how she addresses the kid.  We might have to play the L.A. clip now.  See what we do?  I know we've done this a million times.  Clip show.  But man, according to my Twitter, we've got new fucking people coming aboard all the time.  And it's fucking hilarious.  The L.A. clip is classic.  When you go home and have a few shooters.  Yeah, shooters. 
[00:29:30]  And she didn't even deny it.  She was mad at him.  But she's like, oh, well.  You're calling out on my drinking in between newscasts?  Yeah, you fuck.  How dare you, you big fuck.  All right.  Well, we can move forward to the tornadoes.  And I guess you're going to hear.  Oh, you want to play it?  Paul and Ann.  Should we play it?  Yeah, might as well.  It's right there.  All right.  Paul and Ann Martin.  I've just seen this one.  Oh, you have.  Of course you have.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Well, then we better talk about it.  Do you hear me complaining about it?  Go back.  Sure I have.  You missed something.  Yeah, come on.  Hey, it starts before the graphic. 
[00:30:00]  All the time.  It frequently is.  It frequently is.  Do you hear me complaining about it?  Then we better talk about it.  Because tonight I sent you.  Then we better talk about it.  Because I think you've got a problem.  I think we've got a problem.  All right?  If that's what you think, then we'll talk about it after the show.  And we'll talk about it with Roger Bell.  Because I'm not going to sit here night after night and put up with this shit.  Okay?  Night after night?  You got it.  Night after night?  Well, it looks to me like that's the way it's going to go, Ann.  I'll take the ante up a little higher than that, even. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, boy.  You're not only wrong.  You're way out of line.  Let me tell you something.  You started it, pal.  If you want Harold Green, you might get him.  It's fine with me.  Fine with me.  Good old Harold Green.  Okay.  You want to start dealing with shit?  Go ahead.  That's what you want.  You just might get him.  Slamming the papers.  You know, you go home and have a couple of shooters, and I don't know what the fuck happens,  but when you come back, you're not the same lady.  That's not true.  Some nights it is, Ann. 
[00:31:00]  Some nights it is, Ann.  What, does Ann come back a little soused?  He got her so good, because she just stopped talking when he's like, Roger Bell.  You want Roger Bell?  I don't know what that means.  He must be the news director or something.  But she didn't want it, even though she said she didn't care.  Yeah.  And the shooters.  That's not true.  I've never heard anybody so unconvincingly defend themselves.  Yes.  The best part of that clip, which that version doesn't have, then they go right into the  newscast.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember?  The phony hello. 
[00:31:30]  The fan fire or something?  Someone had a live, someone recorded a live mic just before they were going on air.  Yep.  And then they had to be fucking normal news douches after that.  Anyway, back to, oh, you rocks tell me that's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  How about you give us a few likes?  That'd be nice.  It's all about likes in this world.  Like me.  Tornado sucks up truck trailers.  Yeah.  So we're going to have to, unfortunately, another visual.  What?  You haven't seen this yet, Jimmy? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, you're not going to believe this.  Oh, Jimmy's looking at the white eyed.  Yes.  Very white eyed.  Loves it.  Yeah.  This is the beginning.  The first two start to go.  Keep your eyes on the chain.  You see the flashes.  This is power, power sources.  And in a moment, you will see several of these fly through the air, do 360s before landing back on the ground.  Hundreds of feet in the sky.  That's Chad.  And this is the storm that's moving into the eastern parts of Dallas. 
[00:32:30]  Dallas County.  We're talking about Piedmont edition and eventually Turd Mesquite.  If you're in this area, you need to take cover now.  I believe those are firestone retreads on the trail.  It's called a debris ball, which is literally a ball on the radar created by debris in the sky.  And that storm is moving into Arlington, Texas.  We've all heard of Arlington.  We know the Texas Rangers.  We know all the...  Look at this.  That.  There you go.  And this is just the beginning. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, my God.  No, don't do that.  Oh, my God.  I cannot believe.  Again, not the same ones, different ones.  Oh, my God.  I've lifted into the sky.  Hundreds of feet.  There it goes.  There it goes in the middle of the screen.  Oh, my God.  It's like a Lionel train that someone threw a bus.  It's just flying around there, hitting people?  Oh, no.  Whoa.  What the?  Oh, my God.  And then it just smashes down.  It's just one tornado.  And where exactly is, as we look at these unbelievable pictures here, where exactly is the tornado?  Because, obviously, that's the wind carrying it.  It's very visualized. 
[00:33:30]  You see those fucking trailers?  Just spinning up in the air like that.  That's fucked up.  Oh, my God.  That's movie shit.  That would stink to be walking by.  Oh, my God.  Big tractor trailer fucking...  You know you're next.  Yeah.  Empty tractor trailer weighs about 15,000 pounds.  A bunch of truckers checking in.  How do they know?  They could be up to 40,000 pounds.  When they're loaded.  So, that's fucked up, man.  They were just spinning.  Like, they were made out of paper.  Unbelievable.  But that's not the clip of the morning. 
[00:34:00]  You want to play it now, or you want to...  I want to see the video where E-Rock's standing there, and they're just flying over his head.  That's because you're fat.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, that was a fat joke.  Oh, look at that.  He's taking it in strike.  Oh, God.  Sammy's all white.  Come on.  That's because he's fat.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, God.  We hate acknowledging that.  It's standing there.  It happens, though.  That's great.  He's flying over his head. 
[00:34:30]  15,000 pounds.  And he's out of his face.  No.  He's just enjoying his day.  Yeah, enjoying the day.  It's sights.  Walking to a Carvel or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Find a hot dog.  Why would he be getting Carvel?  Because fat people love ice cream.  Oh, Eric.  Oh, God.  They love it.  Why am I saying, oh, God, that you're saying he eats ice cream?  I just call him heavier than 15,000.  I know.  But my Carvel is out of line.  Just so literal.  So, it leads us today to, oh, my, no, oh, my. 
[00:35:00]  God?  Oh, man.  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  No.  No, what was the shoot?  Holy shoot.  Holy shoot.  Ew.  Holy shoot.  You've got to see this.  This is raw footage of Tornado in Lancaster, Texas.  We'll put this on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony.  Could be the best fucking announcer of a home video during a tornado ever.  This Filipino, it looks like.  Yeah, I think he's Filipino. 
[00:35:30]  Watching a tornado come right toward his house.  This fucking guy is classic.  This guy, and predicted before the show, might be the new double rainbow guy.  This is the next double rainbow guy.  He will, absolutely, they will remix this audio and stuff because it's just too goddamn good.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Tornado right on the top of my house.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Please.  Avoid my house.  Please. 
[00:36:00]  Please.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at the debris fly.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, Buddhist place, America.  Buddhist place, America.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Buddhist.  Please.  Look at that.  Someone roof flying up about two, three hundred feet.  Oh, my Lord. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, oh, my God.  God.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Holy, holy smug is about.  It's about a block or two away from my house.  Missile McGlue.  Missile McGlue.  Oh, shoot.  Oh, holy shit.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  That's full footage.  Oh, my God.  Look at that. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Right on time that I grabbed the camera and run out to my house.  The fact that you're out of my house, I recorded.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  I'm shaking.  Is that sound?  I'm shaking.  Yeah, it's the sirens.  Oh.  The emergency sirens.  Holy.  Holy moly.  Holy moly.  Holy moly.  Hopefully nobody hurts.  Hopefully nobody hurts.  Everybody hurts. 
[00:37:30]  Holy moly.  Look at that.  We got good rental cars.  Holy moly.  Holy moly.  Would a plane fly through that well?  Oh, I don't think so.  Helicopter.  Oh.  Look at the breeze flying.  The breeze.  Holy moly.  Oh, my God.  Holy moly.  It's like Hop Singh from Bonanza.  Holy moly. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy moly.  Oh, my God.  Hopefully nobody get hurt.  Oh, my God.  I got to run.  I got to run.  I got to run.  I got to run.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Now it's just.  Is it going away from him?  Hailing.  Oh, my God.  I think it's actually getting closer.  But.  Or maybe skirting him.  Vincent Tang, his name is. 
[00:38:30]  I, Vincent Tang.  Holy moly.  I think that was about it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it keeps going for a little longer.  You get a couple more holy molys, but he's pretty much done.  It's classic.  That's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  I'll tweet it and whatever.  Oh, my God.  Hey, people saying that we're wrong with the weight of the trailer.  Well, we weren't wrong.  We were told by.  Now they're saying it's 33,000 empty and 80,000 loaded.  How?  33,000.  That's your whole rig?  Is that like the fucking tractor?  Because this is just the trailer part that was being lifted in the air, right? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  So maybe we were right the first time.  Come on, motherfucker.  Fuck.  Now where we're at.  Just assume.  We got us a convoy.  Just assume it's really heavy.  Yeah.  And it picks.  The tornado picks it up like it's nothing.  Oh, my God.  The breeze.  So people fly like that.  Man.  And some of them survive sometimes.  Oh, that's fucked up.  If you find you're half a mile away, then you're alive.  I don't know how that happens.  Could you imagine being picked up by a tornado and tossed a mile or two? 
[00:39:30]  I read a good account by a guy who was.  He survived?  No, he didn't get picked up, but he was holding onto a tree.  Right.  Or I heard him talk about it.  But how does that not.  You have to lose your grip.  No, he held on.  How, though?  And he could look up and see into it.  He could see the stuff going above him.  Wow.  No way.  Yeah.  But he held on.  So why didn't he rip up the tree?  He said there was like three or four trees around him that got ripped up.  And his just got lucky.  His didn't get ripped up.  That's what they did in Twister.  They hold onto a pipe with a leather strap.  And they were right in the middle of the tornado. 
[00:40:00]  And they looked up and saw like the eye of the tornado.  They saw sunshine?  It was extreme.  Oh, no.  That's hurricanes.  Sorry.  Extreme.  Is there an eyewitness account of being tossed by one of these things?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Obviously hard to survive that.  But there had to be one or two that did survive that.  I guess the wind would have to do something to let you down easy, too.  Or relatively easy.  You can't just fling you 200 feet in the air and then you fall 200 feet and you're okay.  What if it throws you into a pond?  A pond? 
[00:40:30]  A poodipond.  A soft pond.  I don't know.  And what about all the debris?  Debris?  Debris.  Debris.  Debris.  Oh, Buddhas.  Buddhas bless America.  Well, and we have to acknowledge if we were on regular radio and did that accent,  there's a very good chance we would be fired.  You will fire.  Yeah.  Because why?  We're making fun?  Because we're imitating that guy's voice.  Are we making fun by imitating that?  No.  Of course we are.  That's just him.  Of course we are. 
[00:41:00]  I'm a minor bird.  Oh, it's amazing.  Just like the Wizard of Oz.  I know we got a lot of Texas people.  Where are you?  Are you sweeping up today?  Yeah, they're very good.  How about you call in?  This is your day.  This is your day to call in.  I would think the ones that are there.  One guy that just annoys the shit out of me on Twitter had to write a million fucking  tweets about it.  Where are you today?  But not much cell service to call in.  You think?  For the people that are there.  Yeah, maybe a cell tower or two might have taken a hit.  Yeah.  How many people died yesterday? 
[00:41:30]  Like, what do we know?  We got any stats yet?  It's all about stats.  How did your parents die?  Nothing?  I guess not.  Yeah, what's the count?  Anything?  Anything?  Hello?  No?  We might have to go back to Mondo Topless.  No stats yet.  No stats yet?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll break.  We're going to reset the old wrestling death clock.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Or should we call it the wrestler dead clock? 
[00:42:00]  I think either way, people kind of know.  We got to reset it.  I believe Sam, he's been keeping track for a while.  We've gone a couple years now?  Yeah.  A couple of years.  Probably been over two years at this point.  Yep.  All right.  We've gone over two years without going 100 days without a dead wrestler.  Can't go 100 days without a wrestler dying.  And I guess that's last night?  Yeah, we got one last night.  Oh, boy.  One we all love on this show.  Oh, it was... 
[00:42:30]  It was my go-to wrestler.  Your go-to wrestler.  My go-to wrestler.  When you talk about wrestlers that have died, you always bring this guy up.  Old school.  And Sam informs everybody that he is indeed still alive.  And now, Sam, not so much able to do that.  I had two go-to wrestlers.  This guy, which we'll talk about next, and Ivan Putzky, the Polish Hammer.  The Polish Hammer still alive?  He's alive, right?  Eating raw onions?  Oh, yeah.  What?  He used to eat raw onions, Ivan Putzky.  I guess that's what keeps him alive.  He's a Polish Hammer.  Like an apple, he would eat an onion.  How does the Polish Hammer look these days? 
[00:43:00]  Like a screwdriver.  I know what you're...  Your go-to wrestler is...  Cherry Shepard.  No, wait.  What was his name?  Sherbert.  Cherry Sherbert.  You don't even remember your own character.  That's not my character.  It's just a guy.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, I'm scooping all over you.  All right.  We'll figure all this out next.  We're falling apart here.  Is it Backlund, you mean?  Bob Backlund?  Is that the Polish Hammer in the middle? 
[00:43:30]  With the bitch tits?  Oh, well, he's 80 years old or something.  Oh, my God.  Maybe he's storing his raw onions in his shirt.  He's got two.  Yeah.  In case he gets hungry.  Jimmy Valiant.  I used to do comedy with one of those guys.  Boogie Woogie Man.  Really?  One of those Valiant brothers.  Really?  Used to do stand-up, yeah.  Is the Honky Tonk Man alive?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Talking shit.  What?  He's still talking shit somewhere?  Honky Tonk Man talks shit.  All the time.  Well, the Honky Tonk Man is going to come. 
[00:44:00]  At least I like the Honky Tonk Man.  Is anyone listening, though, Sam?  Wait, let me see.  Which one's Ivan Putsky?  Go down.  Right there in the middle with the white shirt.  Is that him?  Oh, yeah.  God damn.  He's got that barrel chest.  His boobs are a little low.  His pants are pulled up way too high.  It'd still kick your ass.  Oh, yeah.  He's got that old guy strength.  Yeah.  He's definitely, yeah.  It's something with the ligaments, I think, because your muscles go away, but I think those  ligaments...  Ligaments kind of kick in.  Oh, yeah, man.  Like a blind person's hearing.  You ever fight an old person?  No.  Yeah, me neither.  What did I?  I never did.  Except a woman or two with a pillow. 
[00:44:30]  They're strong as fuck.  They can never get out from under it.  Nice.  Smothering the old.  Of course.  Yeah, I gotta eat.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Are you lonesome tonight?  Do you miss me tonight?  Get in topical.  Hold up. 
[00:45:00]  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Best to get out of the way early.  What are you talking about?  This topical thing.  Oh.  I hear some Elvis Presley.  Yeah.  Oh, when I kissed you and called you.  Is this Are You Lonesome Tonight, I think?  Are you lonesome tonight?  Why didn't you play Laughing Elvis?  Because wasn't that the song he was singing?  Yeah.  Well, if he would listen, here it is. 
[00:45:30]  I'm going to shut up, because this is really good.  And wish you were lonesome.  Yeah, that was the line I got on.  Oh.  Filled with pain.  Shall I come back?  That's great.  Tell me, dear.  Are you lonesome?  Oh, lord, lord.  I want pills and shit.  Oh, Elvis would have been a blast to hang with. 
[00:46:00]  All this fucked up.  The world's a stage, and he's supposed to play a part.  I can't.  Is that how much fun Elvis must have been?  Oh, god.  Oh, man.  Dude.  Chick's just singing in the background still.  I had no calls to dodge. 
[00:46:30]  It's just so fun.  Oh.  I'm going to go.  Sing it, baby.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear.  Are you lonesome?  Ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:47:00]  Is your heart filled with pain?  Shall I come back again?  Tell me, dear.  Ha, ha, ha.  Are you lonesome tonight?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Right on.  Fucking fantastic.  Thank you, Yorick.  I love that fucking thing.  Oh, just fucking high.  Pills and alcohol.  Oh, he loved it.  And his peanut butter and banana sandwiches.  Just laughing his balls off. 
[00:47:30]  Laughing and laughing.  That was Are You Lonesome Tonight 52 years ago that was recorded.  What?  The actual song, yeah.  Oh.  Steve from Bayshore telling us that version's from 1969, he believes.  Steve from Bayshore does a very good Elvis.  Elvis, I've had him actually perform at the compound as Mr. Elvis Presley, and he always  pleases that crowd.  He's an entertainer.  When you open up the pool, will Steven S. from Bayshore be there for opening day?  Steven S. from Bayshore has, like, season tickets to my house. 
[00:48:00]  Season tickets?  He's got season tickets to my house.  Steve always knows he's cordial.  Would you like some Steve from Bayshore singing Elvis?  Yeah.  Oh, do we have a little?  Yeah, we do.  Oh, Steve, hold on to your hats.  And if you want that laughing reaction, you have to show World War II footage.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know that him is near.  This is Steven S.  This is not him.  And so I face the viral hurtin'.  This is about AIDS. 
[00:48:30]  My friend, I'm not a queen.  I love those girls with thick meat curtains.  I've lived life as a fool.  I've traveled down that Hershey Highway.  I'm sure it's things like this that gave me my AIDS. 
[00:49:00]  My AIDS.  That's right.  Oh, pets.  I've banged a few.  But then again, most of them females have paid for sex with youths and one or two large organ  She-mails, my glands, feel scraped and coarse.  My little lungs are clogged with mucus, robed up like Robert Reed. 
[00:49:30]  I think it's my AIDS.  I've had some pain.  Steven S.  from Bayshore could sing.  He can make a living as an Elf.  That is a good one.  That's a funny parody, too, obviously.  Steve from Bayshore.  Iraq, why didn't you go with the MLK guy getting assassinated 44 years ago today?  The MLK guy? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, the MLK guy.  Did you play that song instead of Martin Luther King?  Mm-mm.  Yes.  Why?  What's more important?  I told him.  Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated 44 years ago today, but he went with the Elvis  thing.  Sorry, I couldn't find a fun song to celebrate his assassination.  You could have played U2.  Wow.  Look at that.  The chemistry's still there after all these years.  It didn't have to be a funny song.  It was just an important day in history.  Yeah.  Give me a little U2, MLK.  I don't even know if that song's good.  I know I like it from Unforgettable Fire. 
[00:50:30]  Could have played the other one.  What is that other one about?  Does Brother Joe play MLK?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They play that one.  He plays that one.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What about that other one?  The one about Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King?  Pleased to meet you.  Is anybody here seen my old friend Martin?  What about Sympathy for the Devil?  You tell me where he...  Oh, yeah?  Sympathy for the Devil does a little MLK reference, doesn't it?  I don't know.  I know that they talk about Anastasia, who is the bogus Russian heiress. 
[00:51:00]  The heiress.  I'll sleep tonight.  Fuck.  Oh, Unforgettable Fire.  I know this is pissing people off, though, I'll be honest.  Why?  Why?  They probably don't like U2.  U2 is one of those bands people love, love, or hate, hate.  It's very odd to get somebody that's just kind of, eh, yeah.  I just think Bono's a tool.  Well, I'm not going to argue with that.  You're right.  Yeah.  When I go to U2 shows, it's like, shut up. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  Shut up about Africa.  You could be playing Red Hill Mining Town right now.  Ooh.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I don't want to hear that shit when I go to concerts.  Right.  All right.  That's a fucking intro.  It's a little low, bye.  And also...  It's actually good.  Uh, E-Rock chose not to acknowledge, which is getting topical, uh, segment, uh, that Hank  Errant tied Babe Ruth's home run record 38 years ago today.  Here's what this little racist did. 
[00:52:00]  He ignored the two black accomplishments and he went with all this.  What a racist.  End person.  End person.  The Negro.  The Negro.  Oh.  Uh, wait a minute.  E-Rocks are racist.  Is this also true?  What happened?  John Imus?  Yes, we're getting to that.  All right.  He blew up all the black people.  But I didn't know that happened on Martin Luther King's, uh, assassination day.  So?  Probably no time.  Two different things.  Well, I know, but...  Uh, Nappy Headed Ho is five years old today.  Five years ago.  Nappy Headed Ho is five years old today. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, that's when we had to deal with Nate and all those assholes.  And that's five years ago already.  And also that nonsense on CBS.  It was terrible.  Whoa, whoa.  With, with just race or anything, you know?  Stupid Tom Chiasano in the background.  I said, we shouldn't talk like that because there's parrots all over.  Good point.  What?  If we shouldn't talk like that because there's parrots, there's dumb birds.  And he would list.  Oh.  Jesus.  What's your parrots?  Really?  Catoos. 
[00:53:00]  Shut up.  All right.  That lists.  Shut up.  No one knows what you're talking about.  Oh, God.  Yeah, it's a robin.  So just circle it around right where he heard you.  Beautiful animals.  Holy shit.  That came out of nowhere.  Not beautiful animals.  Stupid.  You wouldn't get a great parrot?  No.  I'd go great parrot.  Nope.  Great parrots know how to talk.  What's that?  Great parrots know how to talk.  Exactly.  I can't even fuck it.  Why do I want to listen to it? 
[00:53:30]  Back to the Hank Aaron thing.  I want to know what those two douches are doing that ran around the bases with Hank Aaron.  Spoiling his big moment.  Remember the two douches?  I thought that kind of made it in a weird way.  Like, it just made it such a madness type of an event.  Like, I guess.  Yeah, but what do those guys do?  I don't know.  Nothing.  I heard that they were Mark McGuire's.  You can see.  They hired them to run.  They're all old.  Great tradition. 
[00:54:00]  So, yeah.  Nappy Head of Ho is five years old.  That caught me.  Huh?  That caught me.  It said Johnny Carson quits The Tonight Show 45 years ago.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  Right.  He didn't leave The Tonight Show 45 years ago.  That seemed like not that long ago.  No, it's when he left and then returned three weeks later after getting a raise of $30,000 a week.  Wow.  40 years ago?  So he was pissed off.  So he walked.  And then they said, all right, all right, all right, all right.  What do you need?  What do you need?  What do you need?  Yeah.  Speaking of which, Letterman extends his deal. 
[00:54:30]  So he's going to be on TV through 2014.  So he can surpass Johnny Carson, his longest running late night host in TV history.  Oh, he wants that little record, huh?  Sure.  Well.  But more importantly, we lost another wrestler.  Oh, right.  Man, when I was growing up in the 80s, I used to watch this guy wrestling.  I liked this guy.  You liked Chief J. Strongbow.  I did.  Aw.  You kicked me.  Remember, he would always do the circle thing in the middle of the fucking thing.  Boy, if that didn't annoy fucking Native Americans. 
[00:55:00]  What do you know about Chief J. Strongbow, Sam?  Didn't he wrestle, like, you had Andre the Giant when he was basically in his prime.  You had Bruno San Martino, I think was that era.  Just those big bruiser guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean.  With their pants pulled up too high.  There weren't many guys that were really in shape, were there?  No.  And, like, slim guys that could really move and flip off the ropes.  Like, these were just big barrel-chested guys, yeah, bouncing into each other. 
[00:55:30]  What was the bit we did?  Dropping legs.  Out of shape, in-shape guy.  Yeah, out of shape, in-shape guys.  That's like any time you see Heston with his shirt off in one of those movies, he's like,  Oh, stop.  Right.  He's trying to suck it.  And you see him trying to suck it in when they take their shirts off back then.  Family guy.  Robert Mitchum.  The Roxane family guy took that from us.  Yeah, yeah.  We did it first, right?  Yeah, we did.  We did it first.  Let me see the Chief Chief Strongbow video of him wrestling.  Because he used to be like, hi, hi, hi, in the middle of the circle.  And who was his wrestling partner there? 
[00:56:00]  His tag team partner?  Well, you probably, Billy White Wolf.  Nope.  I don't remember that.  Billy White Wolf?  I really don't remember that.  Sonny King?  Nope.  I don't remember that.  What the hell are these people you're talking about?  Backland?  Nope.  Backland.  Maybe, oh, oh, oh, when he was on with Jules Strongbow.  That was later on.  I remember it.  Yeah, he was like the fan of Charlie Joe.  Jules, I remember.  So he wasn't a tag teamer?  No, I mean, he became...  For the most part?  Later on in his career, he was.  But he was first famous as a singles guy.  Oh.  I used to watch wrestling when they made Andre the Giant wrestle three midgets. 
[00:56:30]  You ever see that match?  Oh, man.  You ever see that match?  I don't know.  Look at what wrestling used to look like.  Oh, my God.  The bad graphic.  The awful kick.  Really quickly.  So Andre the Giant would wrestle three midgets, and by the end of the match, he would stack  them up and sit on top of them like it was a throne.  They're not going to be doing that shit anymore.  It's a compact, 275 pounds.  They'd always grab each other by the back of the head and shoulder like a real wrestling 
[00:57:00]  move.  Oh, I love these back.  I love the fucking way they cross each other in the ropes.  Look how small the ring was.  Yeah, why is the ring so small?  I think it's like 12 by 12?  Wow, that's a small ring.  It's probably like twice the size now.  Yeah, and they're pumping in crowd noise because it looks like they're only wrestling  a hundred feet crowd noise in here.  Yeah, you're pumping in a different style of wrestling, where you'll see opponents maintain  holes for much longer periods of time.  Yeah, there's like maybe one row of people.  73.  So something very rare happened. 
[00:57:30]  Chief Jay Strongbow died of old age.  This is extremely rare.  Who's the last guy to die of old age in your wrestling death clock bit?  I guess...  Little Tokyo.  Little Tokyo.  He was 70, but he was a midget, so midgets died quicker.  What happened?  What fell on him?  You think he got tussled a lot?  He had a heart attack.  Through his life?  And tongue cancer.  So he had both. 
[00:58:00]  But he probably kept walking in the crotches by accident.  Plenty of people like to get that fucking disease.  You know, shut the fuck up.  I got it.  I got it.  I agree with you, too.  Shit.  I want to see more Chief Jay Strongbow.  Chief Jay was 83.  So how many days did we go without a dead wrestler?  The count is now we are resetting the clock at 29 days.  So we only went 29 days this time around?  Yeah.  That's not good at all.  Wait.  Now, Sam.  Yeah.  Because people get a hold of me all the time. 
[00:58:30]  They don't believe this bit.  They think we're fucking around with it.  Doug Furnace died on March 4th.  Doug Furnace.  Doug Furnace.  But these are all, like, legitimate wrestlers.  I saw Doug Furnace, Wrestler Survivor Series 96, Madison Square Garden.  So, I mean, that's legit.  So when did we start this bit?  I don't have, I, I, over two years ago, though.  We haven't gone 100 days, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I have a, well over two years, I think.  Well over.  Yeah.  That's unbelievable. 
[00:59:00]  I mean, yeah.  All right.  So you just go back, Doug Furnace, a guy named Savannah Jack, Bison Smith, Little Tokyo,  Rod Steele, Macho Man Randy Savage, Larry Sweeney, Oliver Humperdinck, Sean Osborne, all this year.  Wow.  Suicide.  That's amazing.  Not this year.  No, that was 2011.  Not today.  You're a liar.  Dave in Connecticut has some Chief J Strongbow info.  Wow.  Dave.  Yeah, hey, how's it going, guys?  Do you guys remember the classic match? 
[00:59:30]  Chief J Strongbow got tied up by Blackjack Mulligan, tied him up in the ropes, then he took his own  Indian headdraft, stuffed it in his mouth.  While I think it was Fred Blass, he was, like, beating him over the head with a cane.  Classy?  Yeah.  And it was, like, the Indian tribes for weeks were up in arms saying that the wrestling  was fake and that it was prejudice.  Well, how about they mind their own business and clean up the garbage on the side of the  highways?  Oh, man.  And leave this shit to us.  We enjoyed it, right? 
[01:00:00]  You asked Dan Grossman, he'll tell you.  Yeah.  He'll tell you.  Very good.  Dan Grossman.  What a lackey.  Ah, Mr. Fuji.  Yeah.  He's dead, right?  Mr. Fuji.  He's not dead.  He's not in good shape, though.  Oh, no.  Why?  Met him at a signing.  He was not exactly there.  Did you get a picture with him?  There.  Yeah, I did.  This is 82.  And he got more people than Virgil.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Amazing.  Way more people than Virgil.  Yeah.  Blackjack Mulligan's grandson is now wrestling.  Oh, that's amazing. 
[01:00:30]  That's who?  There's a guy named Husky Harris.  He's a big-armed guy.  That's his, uh...  Who gives a shit?  Blackjack Mulligan's a big dude, man.  Blackjack Mulligan is not compared to Andre the Giant, there.  Blackjack Mulligan.  Chief J. Jules, the Strongbow brother.  I love the little leg kick there.  And he's got a full-engine headdress on.  In the French Alps, at 492 pounds, the eighth wonder of the world, Andre the Giant. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Old Gene Simmons hair.  Yeah.  Andre is wearing a black glove, very similar to the one Mr. Mulligan has on his hand.  I can't fuck with that.  Oh, man.  And that's Vince McMahon.  Yep.  Didn't he only lose one match, Andre?  Who's the only person to body slam Andre the Giant?  Oh, of course.  No, he lost a lot more at the end of his career.  He started putting people over. 
[01:01:30]  People are really mad at the Ultimate Warrior that, uh...  What?  Andre the Giant put him over.  What's that mean, put him over?  Like, let him beat him.  So then, you know, your stock goes way up.  Right, and then the Ultimate Warrior was just like, fuck you guys and left.  Ah, the Warrior.  He wasn't a team player after Andre put him over.  What are they all talking about in the corner?  They're strategizing.  They're strategizing for the match.  He's going...  Yeah.  I did not get the guy, throw him out the ring, and then I hit him on the head while you 
[01:02:00]  could tag me and let me hit the man in the face.  What?  We have audio of Andre the Giant talking, because I think he nailed it.  He's asking...  I think he nailed it.  He's asking if any of them want a peanut.  Ah!  Oh, please.  Blackjack Mulligan.  Blackjack.  They would all run outside the ring when Andre came.  Well, he's a veteran.  He knows what he's doing in there.  Let me see the...  Fast forward a little bit, dude.  I want to see the strongholds.  This match...  These matches used to take forever. 
[01:02:30]  The turnbuckle ones were awful.  They would bounce back and forth across the ring.  Oh, right.  It was terrible.  Boing, boing.  I think an average match lasted well over a half hour, right?  And nowadays, it's ten minutes top, Sam.  You're terrible.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know if the average match lasted...  Like a main event match would last over a half hour.  Why are they all ganging up on Andre in the corner,  and the Strongbow brothers are just staying on the other side watching?  Yeah, what the fuck?  They're cowards.  Someone, please help me.  I'm here with a lot of other wrestlers on top of me.  Someone get the Strongbow brothers to help me. 
[01:03:00]  Fucking freak of nature.  People are saying that Chief J was Italian.  Zoidberg.  Chief J Strongbow was Italian.  I've heard that.  You've heard that.  Dr. Zoidberg.  A vicious headbutt.  Yes.  Oh, that is vicious.  Big, fat feet.  Giant head.  Look at the Strongbow's over there, chilling.  Doing nothing with their great asses showing.  Oh, God.  They're dumb guys.  All right, J Strongbow. 
[01:03:30]  J's in.  Oh, why would you tag J when you're Andre?  J looks like Danny Aiello.  That is really bad.  His dumb fucking Indian boots.  He, gee.  Ooh.  Buckle up shop.  They've come a long way.  Oh, there you go.  A little Indian run.  Oh, that was good.  A knee in the face.  That was pretty brutal.  Watch out for Mulligan on the outside.  Yeah, he Mulligan.  Blackjack tags in.  Oh, he does all these Indian things.  Yeah, yeah.  He's going, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Trying to corner J Strongbow.  You can't corner J Strongbow.  It's too quick.  Oh, damn.  How did it happen to you?  Oh, the chop.  This is before Vince actually deemed this sports entertainment.  Yes.  And people really thought it was real.  Yes.  Like, I remember old grandpas and shit sitting there watching going, ah, come on.  You know, being a child of the 80s.  I thought it was real.  82.  Wow.  This is 82.  Wow, TV sucked in 82.  I wasn't alive yet.  What is that, 4-3?  You can watch that shit. 
[01:04:30]  1982.  What?  I was alive about a year.  Hopefully it won't be by the end of 2012.  Wow.  Nice.  Let him get married.  Jesus.  Let him get married.  No, no, no.  Because Jess is a grieving widow.  It would be very hot.  Oh, I like that.  Needing the shoulder to cry on.  Oh, my God.  You understood him, Jim.  Like, ah, no, no.  It's a horrible thing to say.  Then you'd have to stop because I'd be texting her.  How are you doing, Jess?  Condolences.  Why would you have to send me this picture?  Is that helpful?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:05:00]  He just thinks you need to move on.  It's just not nice to say.  Oh, Chief J.  He's doing like, you ever go to one of those Indian powwows and they dance around the fire  and they put one foot first and do a skip move?  Yeah.  And they do the right foot and then left foot and shit like that?  It's, uh, that's what it looks like.  And then he's putting his chest out proud.  He came back in the 90s as the mentor to Tatanka.  No way.  Really?  Not to wrestle, but yeah.  Buffalo?  Tatanka.  Tatanka?  He was age three.  I know what that means. 
[01:05:30]  I speak Indian.  He was born in 19, uh, 29.  29?  I believe.  Wow.  That's like, uh, black and white fast emotion time.  Yeah.  So wait, when he was doing this in...  He was already 53 in 82.  Yeah, you know, he's not young there.  This is not the beginning of his career.  What's that?  This is not the beginning of his career.  He started tagging with, uh, Jewel Strongbow because he wasn't going to do those singles  matches anymore.  Somebody tag me.  Tag me.  I could win the match if you just tag me. 
[01:06:00]  That's a great Andre.  All the resonance he gets out of those big fucking...  That big neck.  It's like a Bose bass speaker.  He had a lot of skin tags.  I saw him up close once.  Oh, did he?  Oh, God.  Where did you see Andre up close?  In Rochester, New York.  I've told the story many times, but when he went in and out of the ring, I swear to  you, flies were following him.  They weren't just in the air.  They were following Andre the Giant.  Like, when you see a horse and you always see the flies that just stay close to the  horse...  Get the fuck out of here, really?  I swear, when Andre the Giant... 
[01:06:30]  That's all I was, like, focused on was, like, are these flies actually following him  around?  Wow.  He must have stunk.  And they were.  Apparently, he used to...  And he had a lot of skin tags.  Well, he's French, right?  Yeah.  He was?  Yeah.  Just being that big and being French, the smell...  Think he was uncut?  I think I got a video of Andre the Giant going into the ring in Rochester, New York.  My friend Buzzy taped us because we were ringside.  Wow.  I gotta find that.  Like, E-Rock was at WrestleMania ringside or really ringside?  We were fucking ringside. 
[01:07:00]  E-Rock was on a two-yard line.  Asshole.  E-Rock's shaking his head.  Fucking asshole.  There's no reason.  Andre used to sit in the locker room, apparently, playing checkers and drinking beer.  Blech.  Oh, boy.  Drinking beer completely naked.  Really?  Like, he just used to sit around nude.  Wow.  He just didn't care.  No, he didn't give a fuck.  It was like Saturday at the compound.  You think he had a big donger?  I would hope so.  Andre, you think he had a big donger?  But anything on him would have looked tiny, right? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He had to have a big fucking...  If it was 20 feet, I mean, or 20 inches, it would probably look good, but...  Yeah.  He probably had, like, seven.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little seven inches.  Andre the average.  I'd say little, because the guy was, what, 7'4", or whatever it was.  Oh, that'd be hilarious.  Thanks.  Can we get him talking for real?  Yeah.  Is there any audio?  Yeah, I want to hear Andre.  Oh, there's a famous promo of him and Vince online, I believe.  And Vince McMahon was really smart, because Vince McMahon is six...  Oh, right.  Six what, would you say?  Three or four easy? 
[01:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  And what Vince would do is, he would put Andre the Giant on a crate to make him even look  taller.  Or he would stand in some kind of...  Yeah.  So it looked ridiculous when Vince stood next to Andre.  He's a smart guy, Vince.  Yeah.  He was really...  He was an...  He still is an incredible promoter, but there was a famous interview online where Vince looks  like he's only five foot tall.  Is Mean Gene Oakland still alive?  Yeah, he's alive.  Mean Gene.  Eric and me got to party with him one time.  Let's play that one so we can hear his, his lemon pie. 
[01:08:30]  You're not above celebrating St. Paddy's Day, are you?  I will.  I will do it.  I'm sure you will.  Yeah.  Wearing of the green.  That's in good taste.  Mask superstar, you have made the comment to me, if the opportunity should avail itself,  you'll go for the mask in a minute.  By the chance, I go.  But first, I want to make myself out of a wrestling fan, Sophie.  I want to stay on the field.  Sounds like Arnold.  Later, after I got his shoulder, I'll count on one, two, three, and Matt.  I'm really afraid to go for that. 
[01:09:00]  What is that?  That sound that comes out of these people.  That kind of sounds like this.  That's his tongue.  His head.  How big his head is?  The resonance.  Massive.  Do you think he was a good Mike guy?  Andre, you couldn't say anything bad about him.  No, he wasn't a good Mike guy.  Do wrestlers respect him?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Hulk Hogan says that he was, the one match he was terrified for was the one where he beat  Andre, because nobody knew for sure if Andre would let him win, even in the ring.  Really?  He said it wasn't above. 
[01:09:30]  Even though they had it planned out ahead of time.  Right, like Andre would be like, no.  No.  Good Andre could have pinned him if he wanted to.  Absolutely.  He could destroy anybody.  How old was Andre when he died?  I think he was less than 50, if I'm not mistaken.  He always looked old.  Happy birthday to me.  Happy.  He was in bad shape at the end.  He couldn't even walk around.  Why did Andre let him pin him?  Was he just ending his career?  Yeah, because Andre knew his time was done and it was better for the business to let him.  Because Vince told him. 
[01:10:00]  Hogan went.  In the end, Vince told him.  Vince makes all the moves.  No.  Vince makes all the moves.  But was Andre kind of beyond being fired?  Yeah, yeah.  Andre wouldn't have been fired and even if he had been fired, he would have gone to  a competitive promotion and, you know, made money against him.  He was massive.  But his head, you can't fake the head size.  Yeah.  It's just like a buffalo head.  Giant.  That's good.  We're pointing out that Andre the Giant was big.  Was big.  The giant.  He was legendary for his beer drinking.  How much was it again?  I heard 119.  In a sitting. 
[01:10:30]  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  Miller.  What's some of that mother pituitary glands we got?  Abnormal.  Oh, what a fucking.  Oh, when his hair got, when he had the short hairdo and the singlet.  I like that one.  Yeah.  And he couldn't, I remember, he couldn't move around at all.  You're right.  No, it's just.  It was getting rougher.  A skeleton isn't supposed to hold up all that shit. 
[01:11:00]  Geez, Louise.  A lot of shit to hold up.  I wonder if his skeleton looks different, like big and bulky, or if it's regular sized  skeleton and big body.  His skull's got to be huge.  Yeah.  Thank you.  What do you think?  It's all just meat and muscle?  It's a lot of big bones.  Fat.  It's big boned.  Cartilage.  Oh, look at that.  Who is that guy?  Bobby.  Bobby the Brain Heenan.  Bobby the Brain Heenan.  Oh, he, I didn't remember.  How's he doing?  How did he die?  Bobby the Brain Heenan is alive.  No way.  But he's probably the best talker there's, one of the best talkers there's ever been.  Yeah.  He got cancer of the jaw and had to have it removed. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Was he a smoker?  I don't know.  Oh, Bobby the Brain.  I've met him and he, yeah, go ahead, sorry.  I've met him and he has no, he still does signings and stuff.  Holy shit.  He talked to me a little bit, but he like, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr, rawr.  You got a picture of him?  Yeah.  I'd get an erector set and just build a fucking Terminator jaw.  That's scary.  You're about to depress the shit out of me.  I'm not going to look at that.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:00]  That's him?  Yeah.  Oh, it'll depress me.  That's a long finger, for fuck's sake.  He must have fucking pointed a lot at you.  Pointed out his finger.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Bobby the Brain.  I'm fucking depressed.  That's fucking horrible.  Oh, Bobby the Brain.  Can I hear him talking?  I don't know what he sounded like.  It's horrible.  It looks like he's going, ooh.  Is that Hannity?  No.  No.  It's Sean Mooney.  Oh, Mooney.  Oh, I remember Sean Mooney, sure.  Different Irish Sean.  Bobby Heenan got so many guys over.  I know in the absence of John Studd and King Kong Bundy. 
[01:12:30]  John Studd.  How do you get yourself in this kind of a mess?  A handicap match with Till Billy Jim and Andre the Giant.  Two men facing three.  Big John Studd, King Kong Bundy, and yourself.  You aren't nervous, aren't you?  No, I'm not nervous.  I just want to collect my thoughts and make sure everything I say is understood properly.  Because it's obvious the World Wrestling Federation here doesn't listen to me, and they don't care about me.  Yes, I am a gifted athlete and a wrestler, but I don't particularly care to wrestle, and they know that. 
[01:13:00]  The whole thing is between Andre and the Hellbilly and Studd and Bundy.  Wow.  And just because some dude is 7'4 and 500 pounds, some dude is 7'4 and 500 pounds, and some dude from Mudrex put their two heads together with an IQ of 10, they want me in the ring.  At least they took care of his list, I guess, right?  He doesn't have to worry about that.  It's kind of extreme, but you've got to, you know, make lemonade.  And they want to get rid of me because they're jealous of me.  My wife, everybody's been jealous of me.  Everybody's been worried about me my whole life.  Take tumors and make tumor rage. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, my God.  That was horrible.  I know.  It's just not even right.  How do I sleep at night?  Jesus.  You know what?  You pass it on.  Collapse in mid-sentence.  Oh, jeez.  All right, enough.  Enough of the wrestling shit.  The time I was trying to, I was knocking on Anthony's back window, and he's fucking just sitting there holding a wine glass fucking fast asleep. 
[01:14:00]  And I finally just walked in.  I'm like, even with all your guns, you're still attackable.  Hey, I remember that.  I was kind of asleep with the wine in my hand.  Yeah.  Real quick Andre story.  Oh.  He was in a six-man tag in Mexico with Bad News Brown in it, and Bad News Brown had done something to piss him off.  So in the middle of the match, he shit on him.  No.  What?  Absolutely.  Who's telling you that?  Oh, he shit on you.  Huh? 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, one of the guys who knows this shit.  Yeah.  He's just an animal.  Jesus.  So what do you mean?  Did he pull his wrestling bottoms to the side and just shit?  No, he probably sat on top of it.  I don't know how he did it.  Shat his pants?  He probably shat his pants just to teach him a lesson.  Shat his pants.  Is there a video of this?  I doubt it.  This would be the greatest video ever.  Yeah.  But I wouldn't think so.  I mean, it was the 70s in Mexico.  Yeah.  So you think that there was...  They're iPhones.  Right.  Yeah.  There was...  So what, did Rondae just run out of that and put on new shorts or no?  I know.  He probably finished the match and kept giving him line drops and stuff. 
[01:15:00]  Remember when I told you about the flies?  I told you about the flies.  You don't give a fuck.  You don't think he smelled?  No.  Do you think his ass stunk?  Oh, God.  Probably took pride in it.  Oh, with that fucking hairy ass just all stinky.  I'm sure he didn't wipe.  And then he would go...  He couldn't.  Probably couldn't.  And just rub his ass in people's faces that he didn't like.  He probably couldn't wipe.  Yeah.  You don't think he could wipe, huh?  No.  You don't think he cared if he stunk?  No.  Definitely not.  I can't reach my asshole.  I can't wipe.  There's a story about him fighting the Ultimate Warrior and he thought the Ultimate Warrior's 
[01:15:30]  clotheslines were too stiff.  And so he's like, ease up on the clotheslines.  The Ultimate Warrior didn't.  Oh, boy.  So the next time Ultimate Warrior ran towards him, Andre stuck his fist down and punched  the Warrior directly in the face.  And the Warrior's clotheslines were light after that.  Was Warrior angry?  Oh, yeah.  He learned.  Warrior.  Yeah.  Good old warrior.  He learned.  Even though Andre, I guess he just was so strong being that big.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Hulk, I think a guy like Hulk Hogan, how big is Hulk?  He's big. 
[01:16:00]  He's like 6'8".  Pretty big brother.  But he's all solid.  He could beat Andre.  Renna Center, heck.  Why would he be scared of fucking Andre the Giant when you're that big and solid muscle?  He probably could beat the shit out of Andre.  Everybody was scared of Andre.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Probably because he didn't give a shit.  He didn't shower and would punch you in the face.  And he was 500 pounds.  So I guess that's kind of hard to move on.  Giant.  So what?  When he walked by, you couldn't even wrap your head around it.  What?  How big this guy was.  Yeah.  You know how big Shaq was?  7'4".  But I'm just saying, Andre was bigger. 
[01:16:30]  Holy shit.  Andre was about the same height, maybe slightly shorter, but way wider.  Oh, Andre meant taller.  Yeah.  Way wider.  That would be unbelievable to just watch him walk in a room.  Andre?  Yeah.  How tall did they say he was back then?  7'4".  I think he was built at 7'4".  He's probably about 7'4".  Yeah.  Because the afro, that's probably what Vince said.  Fucking grow your hair.  Pump your hair up.  Because you'll make him look even taller, right?  I mean, 7'1", 7'2".  But I mean, he was a legit, you know, 400 pounds.  His head is too big to have faked that, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  His skull is massive.  He was fucking...  God, I gotta find this video now.  I haven't thought about this video in a while.  He told him his clothes.  He's like this fucking space jockey in Alien.  You know that fucking big thing that was petrified on the ship in Alien?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what Andre looks like.  Bob Uecker.  Wow.  Yeah.  He's interviewing Andre.  Let's hear it.  That's why you paid me for, to keep you out of the tournament, Hogan.  And you are. 
[01:17:30]  And I know one thing, and that's why the people go to know, too.  And that's why they go to remember.  Remember?  You are the X-Chunk.  His hand is covering Uecker's shoulder.  Oh, man.  Oh, there you have it.  I still haven't found...  He is the X-Champion.  Don't worry about Fanta White.  What?  Now, Hogan, Hogan, it's over.  Oh, man.  Look at his big teeth.  Oh, he's got like...  He had big gums and little chiclet teeth. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, he's choking Uecker.  Look at his hand.  Oh, man.  Look at the size of that.  Well, they can't, Jimmy.  That looks hilarious.  Oh, you're right.  Choking Uecker.  That's a great fucking picture.  Oh, man.  His hands are the size of his head.  It sounds like he has a phase shifter in his throat.  Like, it's this weird thing where, like, it feels like it's out of phase.  That's a great shot.  I'm being told Andre was drunk and he beer shit on Bad News Brown.  Was he beer shit on him?  Who's giving you this info? 
[01:18:30]  A guy in a business.  How much beer did he have to drink to get fucking drunk?  That's crazy.  A hundred.  I guess.  You got to think he went for the hard stuff.  Yeah, well, maybe if you just like beer, though.  Who has time to drink a hundred beers?  Just so he can have a buzz.  He's just fucking sitting naked.  Exactly.  He's shitting on guys.  Yeah, what else can he do?  Look for fucking sewing two pairs of shoes together?  Sewing shoes together.  That was for his hobbies.  I like to drink beer, bump my head, and sew shoes together. 
[01:19:00]  Jesus, Jimmy.  That's what he did for fun.  Bump his head.  Yes, breaking chandeliers.  What did he die of?  I guess his heart gave out.  I mean, you know, he was just too big.  Yeah, people like that don't.  That's too bad.  Yeah.  He was a poor guy.  He used to make all the young guys go out and drink with him and just make them consume 
[01:19:30]  far too much alcohol than their bodies could take.  And he'd ass rape them?  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah.  Shit on them.  That's what Andre would do.  Shit on them, for sure.  We know that.  All right.  Well, Chief Jay Strongbow has died at 83, so we reset the wrestler death clock again.  A-ba-na-na-ma.  A-ba-na-na-ma, Chief Jay Strongbow.  We're back to one.  Back to day one.  Back to one.  All right.  Now this.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:20:00]  Mear, mear, mear, mear, mear, mear, mear, mear.  What else is going on in the world today?  Oh, man.  Hey, I know Nicki Minaj was here at Sirius XM yesterday.  Nicki Minaj.  Yeah.  I hear she's a cunt.  How'd that work out?  Yeah, cunt?  Oh, boy, I hear.  What happened?  I've heard she's awful, too.  I hear she's nice yesterday.  She is a diva that pisses off a lot of people.  She annoys the piss out of...  Is that an act?  No.  No?  Some women do that to keep that diva fucking mystique. 
[01:20:30]  I talked to the girl from Mashup, and she said that she was actually really nice, but  her people were very panicky.  Well, what do you know about the Nicki Minaj there, Sam?  Sam's your go-to guy.  She was in here.  I looked at her a whole bunch of times, but that's about as much as...  Is she good to look at?  I mean, she looks like a caricature, kind of.  Yeah?  She does, really.  Like fake?  Yeah, I mean, she had like a green wig on and a fluffy rainbow jacket.  That's a real hair color, though.  Is it green?  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Envious!  Right.  Oh, boy.  Forgot about the green thing.  Green thing. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  What a green thing.  She had that giant ass, but I think it was fake.  Have that look.  What do you mean?  You think it was fake ass?  You think it's surgery?  Yeah, I think she had ass implants.  I think she also uses padding when she wears pants and stuff.  I mean, there are...  You know, she has...  So broads really get butt bags?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That's got to be weird to sit on.  That's crazy.  How do you sit on a butt bag?  I don't know.  Wouldn't you be afraid it's going to pop?  Fuck yeah.  It's going to pop and it's fucking silicone comes out of your asshole like fucking Play-Doh  through the fun factory. 
[01:21:30]  You could caulk your tub with your asshole.  I understand the booby thing, but who invented the butt bags and said, look, man, I think we  can make money off this.  This big ass has got attractive.  To who?  Really?  Thank you, Anthony.  Let's fucking be real here and honest.  You don't like a nice big ass?  Look, man, we've had him on the show.  This cocoa broad, I don't get it.  Well, that's like a little bit too extreme.  And I know that's going to piss off Danny because I think Danny likes the cocoa, but...  What?  Really?  But there are pictures of her in South Beach with a string bikini. 
[01:22:00]  She looks like she has a huge man ass.  Let me see.  It's big and muscular.  She's got man ass.  Well, Mars and I have talked about this before, and we both agree that she looks much better  with a little airbrushing.  Oh, really?  When you're touching some of the...  Oh, God.  Tell me.  You like that, Ant?  No.  Let me see.  I like that, though.  No.  Why do you like...  It looks like a...  Yeah, I like that.  It's like a rhinoceros.  Yeah.  Why?  That's fucking...  It is a little big.  God, I don't get this one.  But I would rub my fucking dick on those deep fucking cheeks. 
[01:22:30]  No.  Absolutely.  It looks like a man's ass.  No, it doesn't.  Look at...  Find the one where she's kind of bending down to get her, like, beach chair back together.  Yeah, yeah.  And you tell me that doesn't look like a man's ass.  Nice, deep cheeks.  You like it, huh, Jimmy?  I do, yeah.  It's a little big for my taste, but it's still nice enough where I would...  Absolutely...  Look at that.  And the fucking...  Nah, that's fucking...  Come on, guys.  Come on.  It's long and just too...  Oh, but that's a man's ass.  No, it's not.  Look at my ass. 
[01:23:00]  That's a woman's ass.  Look at it.  That's a man's ass that does a lot of squats.  Look at the size of her foot compared to the ass.  That's huge.  Put your foot up there.  Would you fuck that, Tim?  Yeah, I'm down.  Ice-T is all about it.  Well, we know where you've been.  We know where you've been.  You're down with that, huh, Sam?  Yeah.  Man, I don't get it.  I know Mars is all about it.  I know Danny likes it a bit.  Mm-hmm.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  There's too much...  Sam Exxon.  There's too much muscle going on, I think.  Exxon Sam.  Yeah.  I ain't saying.  Oh.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  So, Nicki Minaj, what did we learn about her yesterday?  Yeah, I mean, Jim asked me earlier if I'd gotten a photo with her, but...  Because Jimmy wanted a photo with her.  Yeah.  I didn't care that much, though.  No.  Honestly, I would have tried if she was here.  She's a real piece of shit if Jimmy doesn't want to.  But I don't give...  I've heard that she's such a bitch that she annoys me more than I almost want to meet her.  And I'm not a fan.  Like, I liked her at one point, and then she just started to annoy me.  Of course you're not a fan.  You're a person.  That's a good point.  Sometimes people would go, what are you a fan? 
[01:24:00]  I'd get a head blow on me, because I could use some cooling down, hon.  Oh, good God.  Yeah, I mean, I would have...  I guess I would have liked to get a photo, but I didn't even really attempt, because...  No.  She was here with 20 people.  What's with the fucking posse shit?  Like, literally 20.  Get out of here with your hangers on.  Yeah.  Why do they need such recognition?  God, I love when they go broke because of that shit.  Broke?  She would go into interviews, and her people would go in and tell everybody associated with  the show to put all cameras, video cameras, and cell phones. 
[01:24:30]  No cell phones out.  No cameras out.  No nothing.  It was like when you go to a movie screening.  What about a bird that chisels her image in stone?  They weren't checking for it.  I've seen that.  I've seen that song.  Hey, let me ask you something about that.  So, she was all made up with the green hair and the...  Right.  So, she was ready for pictures and video.  Absolutely.  So, what is the move there?  I don't know.  Like, the person is so special that you're just not allowed to take a picture of her?  Yeah.  No, I'll tell you what happened.  And then the mashup girl said that they did take pictures with her, but they only wanted 
[01:25:00]  them from the waist up.  I guess she was only made up from the waist up.  What?  Oh, my God.  She was wearing nice pants.  Oh, my God.  That was just what...  I think it was...  And I think everything needed to be...  I think she probably didn't want any candids.  Yeah.  Like, she needs to be posing for the pictures.  Oh, right.  So, don't just snap a picture that'll end up online of her not looking.  Go F yourself.  Right.  Fuck her.  Yeah, they said I couldn't even...  I tried to get a one question, which takes five seconds, but...  They said no?  Yeah.  Is there anything more annoying when you go to work here at SiriusXM and they stop all 
[01:25:30]  work for some of these celebrities and you're not allowed to go down certain hallways and  stuff?  Yeah.  And then...  That fucking drives me nuts, man.  She left through the back way instead of through the lobby.  Right.  So that, you know...  Well, that's because...  Was there a...  They do have rules here, you know.  Was there a paparazzi?  I don't know if there...  I wasn't outside.  But I know...  Glitterati?  No, I mean, like, upstairs, she didn't go through the lobby because, like, sometimes  people go in the lobby and try to get pictures with people on their way out.  Yeah.  But she went through the back to avoid all that... 
[01:26:00]  But wouldn't there be people in the back?  No, here.  Like, on this floor.  Where's the back?  Like, you know, there's a back entrance there by the offices to the elevators?  Oh, yeah.  She didn't go for the lobby up here.  Oh.  So, how are you doing?  How do we get out of here that way?  A little wooden door over there.  They still catch us.  Are you trying to tell us there's another way out of here?  There's no way out.  That you haven't told us about yet so we can avoid the bosses?  It's right by your offices.  We've been here for three years.  I haven't been in my office.  Office?  We have an office?  It's not a secret exit.  Wow.  When was the last time I was in my office? 
[01:26:30]  When did this happen?  Why wasn't I told?  I bet you it's been four months since I even seen the office.  Really?  Pop my head in.  Yeah, I'm not joking.  Say hi to the guys.  I always go in there just to check up on the computers.  Oh, you do you?  No.  No.  I'm sure everything's up to date.  Yeah.  The antivirus.  Iraq, do I officially have a desk and a computer or you guys gave up on that a while ago?  No, that was gone day one.  We replaced it with a couch.  Good.  Good for you guys, man.  Yeah, they fucking made it their own.  So that's what she looked like?  Yeah.  There's the Nicki Minaj with her dumb green hair. 
[01:27:00]  That looks like a pretty good fucking shot right there.  It's a good shot.  Yeah, good for Sway getting his picture of Nicki Minaj.  Sway's on there with a t-shirt with a big picture of Africa on it.  She's ugly, huh?  She looks ugly.  I'm serious.  That's why they make her up so much.  I mean, I don't know.  She has a witch's nose.  Her eyes are horrendous.  She has thin lips.  She sucks.  I don't think she's ugly.  No, I'd fuck her.  I'd put it in there good, swish it around like I'm making butter.  Would you get it in? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  Green hair's like from the future with something.  Oh, would you?  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy.  She's making fucking noises.  In other news, NBC apologizes for editing Trayvon 911 call.  The worst apology.  Was it the worst apology?  Why isn't everybody killing him?  Yeah, come on.  Where is all these other...  Why is every network not fucking murdering them for this?  Why are you not stomping NBC's guts out?  Because they all do it.  That's exactly it.  NBC really fucked up, but they all do it. 
[01:28:00]  They all edit their shit to shape the story.  Of course.  So they apologize for enhancing or editing that audio in such a way that made it worse  than what it is.  And one of the best stories, and we haven't really touched on it since Monday,  there's a Maryland woman who claims to have won the Mega Millions.  Maryland.  Oh, Maryland.  Maryland.  What do we know about her before we give the latest info?  Lunatic. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  She was working on a McDonald's.  Don't want her buying a house in parts of Nassau County.  And she was part of an office pool where they all went out and went in on the tickets for  the Mega Millions?  Yes, yes.  And she says she bought the group's tickets and then bought one for herself.  And the one for herself, she said, is the one that won.  Right.  And, yeah.  So there's a lot of controversy there.  But then here is even more controversy.  No one's seen the ticket.  She perhaps doesn't even have this ticket. 
[01:29:00]  She said she hid it in the McDonald's where she works.  Now she's saying she hid the ticket somewhere in the McDonald's that she works and hasn't  told anybody where it is, which leads me to believe this McDonald's will be broken  into and swarmed.  Well, I told that before the show.  I mean, the building ain't worth that much.  I'd be outside there with a wrecking ball right now.  The old wrecking ball?  Yeah, because the ticket's worth well over $100 million.  If you don't find it, then you've still got to buy the place.  I'll take out that building. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  So she's saying she hid it in McDonald's.  Where could you hide a lottery ticket in McDonald's?  Probably under a school book.  Well, maybe that's, yeah, under a diploma.  What happened to McDonald's?  That's all I want to say.  Well, I used to be proud when I was growing up and you see McDonald's in your neighborhood.  I got one close to where I live and wow, it's nothing but riffraff.  It's crazy.  It's nothing but riffraff at McDonald's. 
[01:30:00]  Remember, you deserve a break today, so get up and get away to McDonald's.  Oh, wow.  That would be nice to see that commercial.  But now it's like, McDonald's.  Well, we got to stop in for your McDonald's.  Burn.  We got a homeless guy that's the doorman at McDonald's in my neighborhood.  We're lucky to have him.  Oh, that's good.  So he holds you up for your change and whatever else he can.  Just open the door for you to go into McDonald's.  Oh, that's what it is now. 
[01:30:30]  I'm loving it.  Are you?  I remember Whitey McDonald's, man, where it was squeaky fucking clean.  You deserve a break today.  Whitey used to own the Red Lobsters, too.  Let's not forget.  I remember a time when Red Lobster was all white.  Yeah.  Their commercials are still white.  It's all white people off the docks pulling in lobsters, selling them.  The restaurants filled with white people.  For what?  Red Lobster?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no hint of black people in the commercial.  Oh, no.  Red Lobster is... 
[01:31:00]  They're fighting it.  Red Lobster is like...  The black people like the Red Lobster.  Oh, they love going to Red Lobster.  Are we allowed to say that or is that going to be a problem?  No, I think if any Red Lobster do your own research.  No, you shouldn't gender stereotype racial is true.  Yes, that's true.  Maybe we should apologize now.  Oh, by the way, I don't care if black people go to Red Lobster or McDonald's.  I'm just saying things have changed.  That's all I'm saying.  It's a little different now.  Is this You Deserve a Break Today?  Oh, where's the McDonald's story with this lady?  Oh, you want to hear this?  Yeah.  Yeah, let's hear it. 
[01:31:30]  It's nostalgic.  Did you watch the one from...  This is from 1982.  There's also one from 1971.  Which one do you think you watch?  71!  I thought you were a child of the 80s.  No, I want to see something that I didn't ever see.  Yeah, we know the 82 one.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah, being a child of the 80s.  It's just going up in the 80s.  Oh, my God.  It's just the audio.  What?  Whoa.  This sounds a little...  Maybe it was always this way.  Oh, moving on up. 
[01:32:00]  It's being introduced.  Oh, God.  Does that look good?  Yeah.  Let's get some comments.  What the fuck?  No, that isn't it.  Go to the 82 one, Sam.  You deserve a break.  Go to the 82.  Epic fail.  That's terrible.  Never heard of this.  Epic fail.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Right?  Yay.  Yay!  Yay!  Sometimes you can't slow down. 
[01:32:30]  That's that.  Oh, my goodness.  I was a little too young.  I was a little too young.  I was a little too young.  I was a little too young.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  I was a teenager.  I was a little too young.  He's an asshole.  It's all people doing athletic things.  They're going to McDonald's.  Yeah.  Instead of just laying there alone playing War of Warcraft.  The world of Warcraft.  Or ice in War of Warcraft.  We got it.  Oh, yeah.  From 74?  I'm trying to see the boys and girls at McDonald's.  Oh, God.  I remember this. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, wait.  Wait, what?  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Ronald and who?  Hey.  Oh, that was like Professor fucking, what's his name?  Oh.  This commercial stunk.  Don't forget your seatbelt, Ronald.  Oh, Ronald.  Oh, Ronald's drunk.  His name was Professor Cuntin.  He's a big controversy.  Ronald's just driving a steering wheel in a suitcase.  Yeah, this kid.  Yay!  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yay!  He's got the red hair, too.  Yay!  Do you know how big it used to be when Ronald McDonald would show up at your local McDonald's? 
[01:33:30]  Sure.  Like, there was a big thing that would happen, and they would promote it, and it's like,  Ronald McDonald is going to be at the McDonald's in Elwood on Jericho Turnpike in Huntington,  Long Island.  And you'd be like, oh, and then everyone would go there and watch that.  Oh, this is the one I was talking about.  There's a lot of people in this that you recognize.  I think a guy from MASH is in it.  Who?  The guy that used to take care of the motor pool.  Rizzo?  I think Rizzo.  Yes.  It might be.  He was also in police academies.  Oh, right.  Let's find out.  Let's see.  This is Henry Blake. 
[01:34:00]  The 70s.  I have no idea what this is about.  No, this is...  They're mopping.  Scrub the bottom and top.  Yeah, that was him.  Yeah.  There is nothing so clean.  That guy?  That's my burger machine.  Oh, I bet.  Oh.  Looks like John Amos, but it's not.  Clean it up for the rush.  Oh.  Yeah?  Before you open the door.  Whoa.  What a shine on the floor. 
[01:34:30]  Oh.  They should play this again now.  I know.  Oh, that guy.  That guy.  A lot of those.  A lot of those guys.  They should.  They're just walking around like in a chorus line.  I remember this.  They should show this.  Like some more Sunday?  It's like a big fucking production number. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  I think I might remember some hint of that.  I'm sure you do.  I remember seeing that commercial and driving to McDonald's to buy a burger.  Oh, my God.  I'm kidding.  Let's get back to today.  Mega winner.  $105 million ticket stashed in this Mickey D's.  The wacky Baltimore woman.  They're starting to call her wacky.  Who clean to have one of the three winning Mega Millions.  Tickets now says it's hidden somewhere in the McDonald's restaurant where she works.  Oh. 
[01:35:30]  Scavenger hunt.  Wow.  Marlinde.  M-A-R-L-I-N-D-E.  What?  All right.  Wilson, coyly, wouldn't reveal whether she had stashed the slip of paper behind the McFlurry machine or under the all-beef patties.  And she's apparently not worried about the Hamburglar or any of the employees who say she's trying to stiff them out of a pool jackpot,  making off with her one-third share of the record $656 million multi-state payout. 
[01:36:00]  So she doesn't have this ticket.  I hope she's McKilled in a McDrunk driving accident and then her fucking McSkull is removed.  So why is the media continuing to follow her?  No one would hide a winning lottery ticket at a McDonald's.  No.  What?  She doesn't want to be bothered at home, I guess.  She doesn't want people breaking into her house.  Oh, right.  Well, she doesn't have it, I bet.  She goes, I left my ticket there and it's somewhere safe that only I know about.  That's how you know she's lying.  Only a dummy says that only I know about.  How would you fucking take a ticket worth over $100 million and put it in a McDonald's and then go home and be like, 
[01:36:30]  well, it's safe.  Shut up.  She's a lying sack of shite.  You think a lot of people are in that McDonald's today?  Looking around?  Looking around a little bit.  I hid it in the garbage.  Whoops.  Well, she says, she's the single mom of seven, by the way.  Of course she is.  I'm waiting for things to calm down so I can go back to McDonald's and get it.  Like, people aren't going to look at her and go, hey, there's the lady.  Let's see where she goes. 
[01:37:00]  Right, of course.  The people at McDonald's are too excited.  I want their heads to cool down before I go back.  Yeah, they're excited because they want to kill you.  She stole their money.  She's just lying, I think.  I think she's a liar, liar.  Or she's just too afraid to go cash it because she's getting a lawyer.  I mean, she's getting a lawyer.  I bet she doesn't have it.  No, the manager, who identified herself only as Layla, scoffed at Wilson's claim that the  winning ticket was hidden in McDonald's.  That's impossible.  She didn't come back here after she purchased the ticket. 
[01:37:30]  So she's never come back to work.  Oh, see?  So she's a liar.  Yeah, but why would you blow off your job if you're a single mom of seven kids, unless  you're a whack job?  Yeah.  She might have the ticket.  I hope not.  Or if she does, I hope she loses in court.  I bet she doesn't.  I hate this woman.  I know.  She is despicable.  I hate her.  She says she bought the lucky ticket, the winning ticket, with a lucky dollar she found  on the floor at McDonald's.  It's just one horseshit.  All she's doing is making the fucking case. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  To lose.  She's a compulsive liar.  We'll see what happens tomorrow with her.  Fuck her in the ace.  Love to.  That's what I say.  I'll say.  She's pretty.  Oh, Dr. Drew has another success story.  That's right.  Oh, man.  Another success story for Dr. Drew.  Congratulations.  I used to watch Celebrity Rehab.  Is that show on anymore?  It's not on right now.  Right now, it's couples therapy. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, so he's trying to fade out of that show because he knows it's nothing but problems.  Right?  Yeah.  I mean, another member of the home of fame is certainly there.  So we got Crazy Town.  Shifty.  Come my lady.  Shifty's in a coma.  Yeah.  Come my lady.  You know that song, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  Come my lady.  Right.  Come my lady.  Oh, that guy?  He's in a coma?  He was a classic on Celebrity Rehab.  They used to find him on rooftops and shit.  Really?  He used to go up to the roof to try to do crack.  Yeah.  Oh, that's a good place to go. 
[01:39:00]  Possibly maybe jump.  I think he just wanted a lot of attention.  Oh, yeah.  And the last I knew, he was getting his shit together because they brought him back for  one of the Celebrity Rehabs.  They were all just getting their shit together when the news hits.  Well, he's in a coma.  Wow.  So congratulations to Dr. Drew.  Dr. Drew, another success story.  Fuck that wrestling storyline we got going.  We got to do a Celebrity Rehab storyline.  He does have quite a few people that he took care of that won't ever, ever do drugs again.  That's right.  And they all graduate.  Very successful. 
[01:39:30]  I see the graduation ceremony.  Yes.  They graduate, meaning they're okay.  Yeah.  But in the last week or so, Dennis Rodman admitting he has a massive drinking problem.  He was on those shows.  Oh, is that what it was?  And now we got the shifty.  The shifty.  Another graduate.  Another graduate.  Yep.  Graduate.  Was he in Sober House, too?  I'm not sure if he was or not.  I know he did at least two seasons of Celebrity Rehab.  He may have been in Sober House, but I'm not positive.  Yeah, because when you go from Celebrity Rehab to Sober House... 
[01:40:00]  Yes.  But Shifty may have thought that he had his demons under control.  Yeah.  Dr. Drew gave him all the lessons he needed.  How bad is the coma?  Bad enough that he ain't awake.  Well, is it medically induced?  Bad enough that he ain't awake.  But there's medical...  Is that your professional diagnosis, doctor?  Yeah.  I concur.  Sam.  Sometimes they do the coma medically.  I don't think it's medically induced.  All right.  No, I think they found...  They don't know why he's in a coma.  They thought he might be in a semi-coma. 
[01:40:30]  There's medically induced and there's after-show induced comas.  Because people...  Because everybody's fucking bored by your dumb show.  Oh, shit.  Cocksucker.  Oh, Chip.  Only when you're on it, Chip, you asshole.  Oh, man.  Only when your fucking pussy is on it.  Oh, he got you there.  Why don't you suck another dick, Chip?  Oh.  I never sucked a bunch of dicks a few times. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, God.  And by the way, I don't think that the after-show induces comas.  All right.  Sorry.  No problem.  You seem to get home without falling asleep.  Oh, shit.  Behind the wheel.  Maybe I punch out and have to go to some other station.  Like soft jazz.  Soft jazz.  I hate that shit.  I love soft jazz.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Finger towards my buttocks.  Do-do-da-da-da.  Quash my nipples.  I saw a movie. 
[01:41:30]  Now, say what you want.  Say what you want.  Oh, boy.  I was not watching this movie.  It was on...  Like you don't listen to the after-show.  Right.  No.  No.  Because I kind of do.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You guys are right.  The movie was on the television.  Yeah?  And I was doing computer stuff.  And I went through the channels.  Couldn't find anything through the guide.  So I just put the movie on. 
[01:42:00]  And I left it on.  Because I'm not watching it anyway.  Which movie?  Right?  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  No, it was that horrible Queen Latifah and the basketball player movie.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with you?  Look, I wasn't watching it.  You're going through menopause.  No, no, no.  I wasn't watching it.  It just happened to be on.  I watched it enough to see this lunacy to think that this guy would pick Queen Latifah over 
[01:42:30]  anybody.  It's the dumbest fucking premise ever.  It's so...  It was so bad.  And the reason I thought of it was I thought of soft jazz and stuff.  And at the end, they're at a jazz club just digging the jazz together.  What was the name of it?  What was it called?  Something right?  Just right.  Just right.  Because her last name was right.  Right.  And Common played the basketball player.  Right.  Oh, and wow, you see the poster?  They made Queen Latifah look thin.  They're trying to make her look thin.  When she gets all gussied up at one point, and she walks down the stairs, and it's one 
[01:43:00]  of these typical, you see it in these movies, the entrance that the girl or woman makes on  the staircase to come down the stairs, and the guy looks and is like, just taken by her  beauty.  She fucking comes down those stairs.  Like, it looks like when I remember, I remember when we used to take our horses out of the trailer.  It was the same kind of hooves on wood.  We're supposed to believe, though, there's some beauty there going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's falling for it. 
[01:43:30]  And he's looking like, mm, yeah.  And she's like, you look beautiful.  Is she a carbon moncier in real life?  I have no fucking idea.  I don't know either.  Because I could not get past the fact that.  I've heard rumors, but I don't know if it's true.  She's terrible.  Let's look at the trailer.  More visual shit for our show today.  No, but we don't have a visual element.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  You know who's paying attention to that right now.  Down the hall.  Hello, Donzel.  What do you do?  I am physical therapist at a rehabilitation center.  She's a giant.  Me, too. 
[01:44:00]  You know, next time maybe we can catch a movie.  Her dresses are giant.  She's kind of a relationship, you know?  She's not emotionally ready.  Exactly.  I mean, you know, we can still hang out.  Yeah.  The music stops.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Because you're a fat bitch.  And that's the chick right there that he gave up for Queen Latifah.  Oh, yeah, okay.  That's going to happen.  A very light-skinned, dark woman with long, luxurious locks of hair.  Nice long neck.  Yes.  Very thin.  She's beautiful.  Very lovely.  She's a nice long neck. 
[01:44:30]  And the guy's like, you know what?  No.  She's a beautiful negro.  I need Latifah because she helped me with my knee injury.  And she's just so much fun to hang out with.  And she's sassy.  And the material for her dress is giant.  It really is a giant dress.  I want to go out to play basketball.  I want to see you play basketball.  Nice big long neck.  Yeah, yeah.  She's perfect for sucking your dick in lockness.  You're obsessed with her long neck.  That's all I can do.  Look at it.  It's like fucking four necks piled on top of each other. 
[01:45:00]  That is long.  Let's have an open mind, though.  All right.  Maybe Queen Latifah is the one for right.  Just right.  I don't think so.  All right.  Let's see.  I'm a regular self.  You are not supposed to show him your regular self until you've been married for five years.  Now this is how you get married.  I told you to wear a dress to a basketball game.  Yeah.  She's the sassy one at the game, too.  She yells shit out.  And that's what's her name.  Who's been in here, isn't it?  Who?  From Mission Impossible.  What? 
[01:45:30]  Paula Patton.  Is that her?  Is that her?  Is that her?  Go back.  Nobody is going to give up that fucking chick.  No.  Is that her?  That's not Paula.  What?  Paula looks way hotter in person.  Who?  Basketball game?  She's wearing a neck jersey.  Pause.  Oh.  That's the same long neck chick.  Right.  Yeah, but I want to see if it's the chick that we have in here.  From Mission Impossible?  No.  No.  That's Queen Latifah.  To a basketball game?  Yeah.  The people here want to see Scott McKnight.  Scott McKnight. 
[01:46:00]  Of course.  What a fake movie name.  Yeah.  He can't even open up the gas tank until I hook him up.  That's her.  That is her.  That is her.  Saturday night.  Oh, it is.  What kind of car do you drive?  Girl.  That's definitely her.  She's all fat.  Oh, she's huge.  This is Morgan.  Hey.  Morgan.  A girl doesn't just become the wife of a franchise player by accident.  Uh-huh.  Oh, this is terrible shit.  See, he gets into a relationship.  His luck couldn't get any worse.  But now he has a knee injury.  Yeah, he's got a knee injury.  And now the hot chick is like, I can't be with you if you're not a basketball player anymore. 
[01:46:30]  His luck couldn't get any worse until Fat Queen Latifah shows up.  Right.  And Fat, see, because the skinny chick, the hot one, she leaves him when he blows his leg out  and thinks it's a career-ending injury.  And no chick fucking leaves a guy because he still has a contract.  Right, right, right.  But she wants to be-  He's still got a bank.  She wants the excitement of being at the games and that, but then he finds out Latifah now.  She likes him for who he is.  Well, she's a physical therapist.  Right.  And she just so happens to be the one that helps his leg. 
[01:47:00]  But what about the slob part?  Exactly.  Exactly.  What about the part that she's a fucking pig?  What about the slob part?  Yeah.  All that other shit is nice.  Yeah, yeah.  But you're still looking at a slob.  Exactly.  Who's just pretty?  The elephant man was very polite, too.  The job is yours.  I have an NBA player's career in my hands.  You really think you can give me that?  It's well as a burger.  Fatso.  You're going to hate me by the time I'm through with you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she's going to work him out.  I love his name, Scott McKnight. 
[01:47:30]  Scott McKnight.  I can't take some player off the bench.  You're not staying?  Have you lost your damn mind?  Oh, she leaves.  She leaves.  Now, Latifah's sassy.  Get up.  You get to work.  Okay, okay.  Oh, ha, ha.  She dumped ice on him.  Yeah.  Here's the workout montage.  She's motivating.  Yay!  She motivates him.  He comes back.  Yay!  Three points.  Yay!  They just told you the whole fucking movie.  Exactly.  This is the whole movie being shown.  And now they're getting close together. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  They might be kissing there.  I'm so sorry I left you.  Please give us a chance.  See, he's back.  And then she comes back.  After the work she did with you, she's become a hot commodity.  Five teams offered her a training position.  This is the entire movie they're showing.  What a terrible job.  Queen Latifah.  Hot common.  Just right.  They just...  Oh, there she is.  Coming down the stairs.  Packing something in that wallet.  I'm not one of those salad-eating chicks.  No shit.  Unless it's grazing in a field.  That literally, they showed you the whole movie. 
[01:48:30]  They showed the entire movie.  The only thing they left out is the very, very last part where...  Where it happens.  Yeah, where she actually, you know, Latifah wins him.  That means you never turned off the TV.  Well, no, it was on the whole time.  I was computing.  He tried.  I liked the movie.  I was computing.  And then it got to a point, no, it got to a point where I hated it so much I couldn't turn it off.  Are you sure?  I couldn't deal with fat Queen Latifah being the fucking love interest.  Are you giving up that you like chick flicks today? 
[01:49:00]  Black chick flicks.  Black chick flicks.  Ah, I want to watch how Stella got her groove back.  Where they all have glasses of wine and they talk about how awful men are and then they dance to Motown music.  Right.  Yeah.  I want to see that.  That's probably ten different movies.  Did anyone see Just Friends?  I heard that was really funny.  Just Friends.  You're in the...  Colin actually told me it was a funny movie.  I saw Just Friends.  Was it good?  No, I'm not going to go see Joanna Mann.  Yeah, that was a movie.  Joanna Mann.  Just show me for a minute because I don't want to see the whole movie. 
[01:49:30]  Which one was Just Friends with Ryan Reynolds?  God, I love my life.  Oh, man.  Awesome.  Blues are awesome.  Uh-oh.  I'm not serious.  Chris Brander has it all.  Chris Brander?  I saw you flirting with me out there.  How did you do that to your boyfriend?  We were just friends.  But in high school, things were a little different.  Oh, yeah.  This movie's great.  He's in the fat suit.  This movie's with Amy Smart.  Really?  Yeah, this is a really good movie.  What a horrible fat suit they put him in.  I know. 
[01:50:00]  It doesn't quite look...  It looks very cartoony.  We're friends, right?  Just leave it on.  It's a good movie.  Oh, boy.  Yeah?  I didn't mind this one.  All right.  In a fat suit, he looks like somebody.  But why do they have to fuck Eric?  Why do they have to...  Oh, jeez.  Why do they have to get fucking good-looking people to play flat people?  Flat people?  Because they can't then make him good-looking.  But that's how bad fat people are.  Like, they have to get good-looking people to play you just so he can feel something for  you.  Oh, man. 
[01:50:30]  That's a terrible view of Hollywood.  It's a great view of life, though.  Shut up, fatty.  Yeah, I like just friends.  Just friends.  You're among friends, Ricky.  Just friends.  You're among friends, Sam.  Let me see your wrists.  Roland is here.  Roland has a ride.  Oh, good.  I wish I was...  What?  What?  He's wearing his Tebow jersey.  Jesus.  He is?  Why didn't he wear Bruce?  Didn't he go to Bruce again or something?  He was out of Bruce last night, yeah.  Fucking Bruce.  And he's going tonight, too.  How is Bruce Springsteen, Roland? 
[01:51:00]  Amazing.  How is it amazing when it's the same thing you've seen?  And how many times have you seen Bruce Springsteen now?  Um...  Four.  Four.  Three times.  Three times.  It's over the 250 mark.  Did he do any hits?  He did a lot of hits.  And a lot of...  Oh, wow.  You were close.  Was that from last night?  Yeah.  Again?  Yeah.  How did you get that close?  Um, you guys have a lot of fans who are Bruce Springsteen fans.  You got hooked up?  Wait, that looks photoshopped.  I know.  That's what everybody said.  It looks like you're in front of a Bruce Springsteen poster. 
[01:51:30]  Is that?  Come on.  Where was it?  I have video, though, too, to prove that was there.  Yeah, the lighting looks kind of right.  Doesn't that look like it's, uh...  How close are you?  It does, but look at the big white light to the upper right, and you can see the shiny  spot on his head from it.  What were you in the second row?  The front row.  He had backstage passes, too.  Yeah.  Did you meet him?  No, no.  Got a picture with Bruce?  We met him, though.  No, no.  But, uh...  He was so nice, though.  Why did you get to meet him?  He was with other...  You still don't have a picture with Bruce?  Oh, that's almost a picture with Bruce Springsteen.  Yeah, that's how you figure.  Like, you know what?  I was so happy last night.  It was an amazing show.  By the way, do you know how many photoshops Travis and me were just talking about this 
[01:52:00]  in the office with his picture?  Oh, man.  How much photoshopping is going to be done, Roland, in front of various...  Oh, yo, man.  Oh, yeah.  That is a great shot you can roto out of Roland.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You should put him in front of a train like it's going to fucking kill him.  Why?  Wow.  That is a great fucking picture to take out and put him in front of things.  Yeah, have a rape happening behind him.  Oh, please do that, people.  It's up on our Facebook.  It's up on Facebook.  Start photoshopping now, people. 
[01:52:30]  You have a homework assignment.  Dare I say, this could be a new...  Oh, wow.  It could be.  Let me see, Roland.  That's close.  What do you got?  How did you get so close?  Where was it, first of all?  At the iZod.  The iZod?  Front row?  Yeah, right there.  You guys have great fans and this person...  What, somebody gave you front row tickets?  How long did it play for?  Yeah.  For what?  For what?  That is dick taste.  For what?  Scrumptious.  That was busy.  How long did he play for?  Three hours and ten minutes.  Wow.  Non-stop, no encore. 
[01:53:00]  What was the last song?  That's like a job.  10th Avenue, Freeze Out.  Oh, the only fucking hit I heard him play at fucking...  But he did Born to Run.  He did everything else.  Oh, of course he did.  Why wouldn't he when I saw him?  What else did he do?  I've seen him again tonight...  I've seen him again tonight and have an extra ticket, too.  Did he do Youngstown?  No.  Hey, Youngstown!  What about Dunder Road?  He did that.  What about the hitter?  He did Thunder Road, Because of Night.  Did he do Into This Tunnel of Love?  Philadelphia? 
[01:53:30]  What?  No, no.  That's only in Philadelphia.  What?  He only plays that in Philadelphia.  Really?  I'll just play it elsewhere.  How about Pink Cadillac?  I mean, come on.  No, that'll be the second leg of the tour.  He'll do that.  Pink Cadillac!  Turn down the street.  It was a ton of fun.  What about Candy's Room?  A ton of fun.  Iraq was there.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  But it was good.  He did Jungle Land.  Did you say that one?  No, he didn't do that one.  Oh.  I don't know.  Probably tonight, though.  Did he do Bourne in the USA?  No.  Why didn't he do Bourne in the USA? 
[01:54:00]  Because he might do it tonight, because he does a wholesale list tonight.  Oh, great.  And they tell everybody, I'm on New Jersey's.  I'll see you tomorrow.  And we're like, yes!  But they already got the tickets.  It's already a sold-out show.  So how about you play the hits for everybody?  Same place?  Stop mixing them all.  Yeah.  How was the IZOT?  I left...  How many people?  Like 18,000-something.  What?  Yeah, it took me two hours on the bus line to get home.  Oh, I don't care.  Why not the subways?  You can't get it from IZOT.  What?  Take the bus.  Why?  Is that in Newark?  Fix that. 
[01:54:30]  No.  Were you late for the show?  No, I left at 5.30.  I got there at 7.20, the traffic.  Yeah.  That was awesome, though.  I thought they had trains running down there now.  Ross was there.  Ross was rocking out.  How long did it take you to get out of there?  He said already.  Oh, he did?  Oh, I thought it was how long it took him to get there.  No, it took me two minutes to get out, but the line was, like, huge for buses back  to New York.  Yeah.  They're not too swift on that.  Yeah.  They got to figure that out.  How long did you have to wait for the bus?  An hour and 45 minutes.  Oh, my God.  I would have fucking went crazy. 
[01:55:00]  I would have went bananas and not in the split way.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  I had a great time, though.  Good for you rolling.  I'm glad you went.  I'm off again tonight.  Bruce.  When will you have had enough Bruce where you don't have to go to every show?  When he's off tour.  Huh.  Well, you'll go to every single show that he comes to in this area.  Why?  Haven't you?  That's his thing.  But isn't it...  We all have our thing.  Isn't it a weird obsession?  Are you in love with Bruce? 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  Are you in love with Bruce?  He did say yesterday that he would blow him.  Yeah, but I respect that.  If he is loving.  Are you...  And let him fuck him in the air.  He said he would let Bruce fuck him in the air.  And did Sam say he would let The Rock fuck him for free?  I said blow.  I said blow.  I said I'd blow.  Would you be embarrassed if Bruce was fucking in your shit all over his dick?  Ah, man.  And left.  I said, yeah, that's a risk you take.  Roland can't handle my cock in his ass.  Yeah.  What's the matter, Roland?  I'm tired.  Yeah?  It's a long night for Roland.  Did you... 
[01:56:00]  All right.  I'm not getting past the point where Sam said he would blow fucking The Rock.  I wouldn't if he wanted.  If he said The Rock says blow The Rock.  The Rock says blow The Rock, and then you'd fight him.  Well, what part of that isn't gay?  Which is a favor to The Rock.  All right.  I'm just asking.  Favor.  How about if you were blowing him, and you felt like his dick swallowing, you're going  to make me blow too quick, and he pulled it out and just started tapping your lips with  this?  Oh, God.  The Rock's going to do what The Rock's going to do.  He says, if you smell...  La, la, la, la. 
[01:56:30]  La, la, la.  La, la, la.  La, la, la.  Oh, yeah.  What The Rock is cooking.  La, la, la, la, la.  He was cooking in his ball bag.  Yeah.  Which is worse.  He'd be blown by The Rock or seen his tooth fairy move.  Although, although Roland said that he would also blow The Rock.  Yeah, I would.  I don't know why.  Why would he blow The Rock?  Yeah, he's a rock.  Double teamed by The Rock and Bruce.  Hey, you guys want him to see you?  I'll do sacrifices.  Oh, they're high-fiving.  I would blow a rock in there.  When do we get him in?  Well, we have to blow him probably first. 
[01:57:00]  What happened to get in The Rock in the studio?  I thought that was a done deal.  No.  No?  Check the emails out.  He's a big fan of mine.  Geez.  He's not a fan of Jimmy's?  He is a fan of Jimmy's.  I've talked to him.  I haven't blown him, though.  I haven't blown him.  Yet.  What the hell?  You're still hoping.  You're still hoping.  Depends on whether me or Roland get to him first.  All right.  And The Rock has...  Running at him with open mouths.  The Rock has no choice in this?  No, it's if he wants.  I bet The Rock has a few other people on his list to give him blowjobs before you guys show up. 
[01:57:30]  Who, E-Rock?  E-Rock, are you down to blow The Rock?  E-Rock, you blowing The Rock?  You gotta do what you gotta do.  Yes!  Three people on this show would blow The Rock.  People's dick.  Right in your mouth.  Jesus.  That's a little crazy.  You wouldn't blow The Rock?  No.  I don't think I'd blow The Rock.  No.  I don't really have any feelings for The Rock like that.  What do we get out of it?  Me and him are just friends.  Nice load.  Oh, God.  Great story. 
[01:58:00]  A great story, really.  Yeah.  Bragging rights.  Roland, why the Jets shirt today?  We're still about five months out, aren't we?  Yeah, I just woke up late.  Is that your Tim Tebow shirt?  Tebow.  Yeah.  Let me see the back.  It's all fucked up, right?  Yeah.  Why is it fucked up?  Is that what they're going with?  That's the little bastard who made the t-shirt made by quality.  Let me see.  The little bastard.  Well, it actually looks a little worn now.  But everybody knows that he just fucking signed us.  So it's not like, yeah, see, I'm the original guy.  I've had the shirt when he was fucking first signed ten years ago. 
[01:58:30]  It's my old Roger Orsky shirt.  It's my Emerson Boozer shirt.  Yes, Tebow.  He hasn't thrown one fucking pass for the organization.  And rolled shirts where he worn out.  Where the fuck did you go to get that?  It was at the Jet store.  It was brand new.  I washed it.  I pulled it out.  And, like, white flakes were everywhere.  I'm like, ah.  Big news in the NFL.  They blew off Reebok.  And they're going with Nike for their jerseys.  That's why they got mad.  Because Tebow jerseys on Reebok were $100.  Nike's like $300. 
[01:59:00]  Really?  Oh, hell.  So what?  A Reebok's deal with the NFL was up?  Yeah.  Anyone know this?  So they just made all Tebow stuff for, like, 50% off.  And people are bitching because the jerseys look exactly the same.  They were hoping Nike was going to, like, do something a little different with them.  It's a big sports story.  WWE admits major Marine mistake.  Wrestler who went AWOL twice.  They cast a wrestler who went AWOL.  Well, Randy Orton, yeah.  He was dishonorably discharged from the Marines.  Randy Orton was?  Yeah.  And then the WWE cast him in their third Marine movie. 
[01:59:30]  Oh.  But now they've taken him out of the movie.  Oh, boy.  Why?  It's a movie.  Wait, there's a third.  Because the Marines got upset.  Wait, there's a third Marine movie?  Yeah, I don't know.  The first two sucked.  Doesn't matter.  Make another one.  John Cena was the first one.  And then Ted DiBiase Jr. was the second one.  And then they go with a third one.  Was Virgil Jr. with him?  Wow.  Did he sign E-Rock's belt?  This is a very cute video.  The kid's hitting a Spider-Man pinata, and then he goes and hugs it.  Aw.  Did you see that? 
[02:00:00]  No.  Get in on the video.  He's going to grow up to be a fine interior decorator.  Yeah.  That's actually very cute.  Look at Lolo.  Here it is on TV.  Looks like Little Ricky.  Look, he's hitting the thing.  He doesn't want to.  There's an episode of Fred Claus when his older brother Santa was the one showing the  compassion for other people.  Sure.  It's a shame that didn't win the Academy Award.  It's fixed.  Your favorite next time.  Yeah, it happened to me in my Spider-Man outfit.  Right.  The villagers and the parents were hitting me with sticks.  The parents were hitting me with sticks.  And he came over and hugged me.  It was marvelous. 
[02:00:30]  Here's your candy.  Take that.  Should we take a little break?  I'm game for that one.  Roland, you got anything else?  Bruce was good.  Tebow's good.  Would you blow Tebow?  For Jesus, yes.  For Jesus.  For Jesus.  Not for a Super Bowl?  Really goes hand in hand with the whole religion.  You got to blow up for the Super Bowl before Jesus.  For nachos.  For nachos.  You're a whore.  Is Springsteen going to D.C. at all?  He just came back.  He just came from D.C. 
[02:01:00]  Not Roland.  Where was he?  Last week.  Was he at the Improv April 12th, 13th, and 14th?  Roland, Roland, Roland.  You walked right into that one.  Roland.  Jimmy's going to be down there.  Selling very well.  Next week.  No.  Oh, yes.  Next Thursday through Sunday?  Yeah, not this coming weekend, but the weekend after.  Or you do a Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  30, Friday, Saturday only.  Yes, next week in Washington.  I should plug April 19th through 21, the Funny Bone in Cincinnati.  That's my last gig before Cleveland.  Nice.  And we all go to Cleveland.  We are going, right? 
[02:01:30]  When are we going to announce that?  It's the Hard Rock Cafe or whatever the fuck.  Or House of Blues.  Where are we going again?  How long is this not announcing it?  Because we don't fucking know yet.  What's wrong with these people?  Come on.  We're 99% sure, but we're not announcing it yet.  But we were 99% sure.  What are we not sure of?  What are we not sure of?  We're not 100% sure that we're going to be at the Hard Rock.  Why?  I thought it was House of Blues.  Shouldn't we know right now so we can stop promoting this?  People are trying to make their plans.  Come on.  Make your plans to be.  What's wrong with these people?  What's the problem with this one?  In Cleveland on that Friday afternoon.  Why are we not announcing it?  What else do they have to do down the hall? 
[02:02:00]  The paper hasn't.  They haven't signed the paper yet.  Who hasn't?  What's going on?  Kenny!  Oh, is the Hard Rock's held up?  Kenny, do you know anything about this?  The agreement has yet to be signed.  By us?  No, no, no.  By the Hard Rock.  Okay, this is the Hard Rock.  Why?  Why is it taking so long?  Are they scared of us and our fans?  No, we're going to do it at the Hard Rock.  We're just waiting for them to sign the paper.  Well, how about they sign the paper?  That's a good call.  Kenny?  Anything.  That's true.  But yeah, just be in Cleveland on that Friday afternoon. 
[02:02:30]  It'll be an afternoon show.  Because people are driving from faraway lawns to join us.  Right, well, it's in Cleveland.  And then we've got to come up with some kind of hashtag so everybody on Twitter can get together  because they're trying to figure out where they could all hang and stuff.  There's a whole thing going on.  Hashtag ONA in Cleveland.  Why do we have to have in Cleveland?  So people know what you're talking about.  How about OACleveland?  What's wrong with saying in?  Because it's two words.  How about Open Ant, west of PA?  I like that.  I like that, yeah.  Perfect.  Print it.  It's a good one. 
[02:03:00]  Maybe if you weren't blowing the fucking rock, you'd get the shit straightened out.  I said I would.  Not that I am.  What are we eating?  It smells good.  I'm having a piece of probiotic gum.  Would you like one?  It's like Razzle's.  It tastes like Razzle's.  The flavor goes away quickly.  The flavor's gone.  I'm chewing wax.  Does it make your shit good?  No, but it's good.  It's like I blew the rock.  It's good for you.  Is that what it's like?  It's better than fucking what you want to call it?  It's better than sugar.  It's better than aspartame.  I'll try it then.  I like sugar.  My food pocket is working off.  The gum is officially...  I swear, I've been chewing this gum probably... 
[02:03:30]  30 seconds.  Not even 30 seconds.  The flavor is completely gone.  Completely gone.  But it makes your mouth nice and moist.  Which I could use.  Okay.  So is the rock's cock, right, Sam?  I could only imagine.  Yeah, I bet.  Have some probiotic gum as shit.  Why don't you get some amateur biotics along with it?  Because that's not what it's called.  You're making fun of their name.  They get sued for that.  That ain't me.  What do you guys want to do in Cleveland?  20 seconds, Sam.  Oh, it's gone? 
[02:04:00]  Gone, right?  Yeah, I was keeping track.  There's nothing left.  Because I didn't believe you.  20 seconds.  I'm enjoying this.  The flavor's completely gone.  No, it's not.  Completely.  Where did the flavor go?  What do you guys want to do in Cleveland?  It's hard to chew, too.  But it makes your mouth nice and moist.  Yeah.  Be there.  You're not going to plan anything?  For what?  Why do it now?  The show?  Yeah.  Why start a new fucking trend?  That's crazy.  Why don't we plan something?  You're going to do some bits?  We don't know where we're going to be.  It'll probably be the hard rock.  If it's not the hard rock, someplace similar to the hard rock.  What happened now?  What kind of event should we do? 
[02:04:30]  We should do something.  Some kind of...  Oh, this gum's horrible.  This is terrible.  I love this gum.  Why don't you get dentine?  What do you fuck?  It's got aspartame.  What am I going to do?  Get fucking mouth cancer?  Have no jaw like fucking Arnold DiBiase?  Bobby the Brain.  I don't think it was fucking gum.  I don't think it was a stick of fucking trident.  Every so often.  Wow, that gum sucks.  I love it.  Still nothing for Cleveland.  It doesn't taste bad.  It just...  Fuck Cleveland.  It tastes like nothing.  What do you mean fuck Cleveland?  I want flavor.  I like juicy fruit.  You want to fuck the whole city?  It's going to move you. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, really?  Good stuff.  Yeah.  Yes, that's what I am.  Yes, I'm juicy and a fruit.  We better go to break.  Figure some shit out.  We're going to go with the...  I'm not a lot.  We're going to go with the church porn slideshow next.  I like that.  And maybe the cheerleader that was banging the kid.  Oh, right.  Yeah, that's a good story.  It is.  Well, it's hot.  It is hot.  Always hot.  All right.  All right.  Well, that gum sucked. 
[02:05:30]  That was...  Careless Whisper.  Which version is this?  This is Seether.  Seether it is, right?  She makes lousy gum.  Yeah, why don't we all enjoy a chew, huh?  Seinfeld.  Yeah, Lloyd Braun's gum was a lot better.  Should we play this clip?  Get like a hundred bucks.  Yeah, play the clip because any time we have a gum discussion, all I think of is the Seinfeld  gum episode and this scene. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, Jerry, look who's here.  Oh, Lloyd.  Hi, Jerry.  Got some more of that gum.  Oh, the gum.  Yeah.  Let's all enjoy a chew, huh?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Now, see, this is what the holidays are all about.  Three buddies sitting around chewing gum, huh?  So, you know, Lloyd, he thinks he can get more of this. 
[02:06:30]  Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow.  Not sure he can accomplish anything he sets his mind to.  I love the chew.  That's such a weird...  It's all enjoy a chew.  What a weird scene.  It's so fucking strange.  What was it about?  Yeah, Lloyd Braun and his gum.  You've got a connection in Chinatown to buy gum.  Cheap?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, a hundred bucks will get you like fucking six big boxes of gum.  Oh, are they going to just resell it?  Well, no.  Jerry just wanted...  Jerry didn't want any gum. 
[02:07:00]  Kramer talked him into buying gum from Lloyd because Lloyd was in a mental hospital and  you don't...  He didn't want to upset Lloyd in any way.  So, when Lloyd asked if Jerry wanted gum, Kramer was like, yeah, of course he does.  And then Jerry was wearing glasses because, again, not to upset Lloyd Braun, Lloyd thought  Jerry wore glasses.  So, then he gave Lloyd a hundred dollar bill by accident and Lloyd bought a hundred dollars  worth of the gum instead of just, you know, a pack of gum. 
[02:07:30]  Fucking hilarious.  Is that Lloyd?  Yeah, Lloyd Braun.  Lloyd Braun, by the way, is the father in hand that rocks the cradle.  Yes.  Really?  That is Lloyd Braun.  He said three buddies just chewing gum?  Yeah.  Let's all have a chew.  Let's all enjoy a chew.  Just sit down and they're just sitting on the couch looking stupid, chewing gum together.  Like it's a thing to do.  This is what it's about.  All three buddies just chewing gum.  Just chewing gum.  Just enjoying a chew.  All he's trying to do is keep Lloyd Braun happy and not, like, to make Lloyd not think 
[02:08:00]  he's going crazy again.  Gotcha.  That's pretty funny.  It's a perfectly sane food.  So, we got a church that played some porn.  Pornography?  Catholic Church launched an investigation after an Irish priest inadvertently played a slideshow  of gay porn.  Ah.  Inadvertently.  To a group of parents who had come for a meeting about their children's first communion.  Oh, boy.  Well, he obviously had it on his fucking computer. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  How did it get on there, first of all?  Well, Father Martin McVie was setting up a PowerPoint presentation.  Oh, boy.  When the sexual images popped up on the computer.  Ah.  Just by accident, right?  There were plenty of shocked faces, one person in the meeting told the paper.  There's a lot of parents very, very angry about this.  He'll say somebody else did it, a prankster.  Let's find out.  A prankster?  I don't know.  Let's see.  I didn't read this one yet.  You've got to watch when you have other pictures on your computer, when you're doing 
[02:09:00]  a PowerPoint from said computer.  Oh, that's a great line.  Parents said in a statement that McVie quickly removed the offending memory card from the computer  and bolted from the room.  You know when you have to do something quickly, it never works out?  You're always fumbling.  Just fumbling, trying to get it out of there.  It's just showing horrific gay porn on the screen.  A couple extra pumps.  Ah!  It's like, ah!  Trying to pull the memory card out and flee the room.  Oh, boy.  Because I guarantee you he knew there was other stuff on there.  Oh, man.  You would just grab your card and run, right?  I would actually break the computer. 
[02:09:30]  I would call it the sprint for freedom.  You just run, run, and don't look back.  Come on.  He was visibly, um, you want to guess?  Want to play Mad Libs?  Shaken.  Shaken.  Or, uh...  Visibly excited.  Distressed.  He was visibly blank and blank.  Turgid.  Yeah.  Turgid.  He was visibly blank and blank.  Angry and upset?  Uh, visibly upset?  Is that one word?  Shaken?  Shaken and upset.  Good with shaken.  Visibly shaken and queer. 
[02:10:00]  And disturbed.  Gay.  Homosexual.  Pedophilic.  That's why I'm playing this dumb game.  Not for the real answer.  He was...  Flustered.  Flustered?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  Should have gotten that one.  The statement said, according to the Associated Press, he gave no explanation or apology to  the group and bolted out of the room.  Oh, boy.  That's not good.  If it wasn't his...  If it was his, if it wasn't his, you would go, what is this?  Yeah, what is this?  I want to apologize to everybody.  I don't know where this came from.  He grabbed it up, ran back to his room. 
[02:10:30]  I think you're bolted no matter what.  There's no way you could explain this, even if it wasn't yours.  No, not if it's...  You would be equally outraged if...  Right.  Think about it.  If you were somewhere and you put it in a memory card for something, let's just say  they were showing World War II footage instead of the comedy, you'd be like, what the...  What is this?  What the fuck is this?  Right.  You would react angrily.  The coordinator and the teachers then continued with the presentation.  So he ran, and then they continued with their first communion thing.  McVie returned to the meeting 20 minutes later, of course, and told parents that 
[02:11:00]  children get lots of money for their holy communion and should consider some of it to  the church.  What a scum.  Consider giving some of it to the church.  Of course.  Parents present at the meeting were understandably furious, and many of them pulled their children  from the first communion program.  I bet.  That whole organization is enough already with that whole fucking organization.  You don't enjoy the Catholic church?  I don't care if the guy watches gay porn.  I just hate the fact that most of them watch gay porn, and they're so anti-gay.  And they're very anti-gay.  You fucking can't stomach them. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  So that happened, and that was awkward for the guy that had to run away real fast and  far.  Ah.  Sorry, I'm just ordering.  What?  I love how you can just order.  What, his memory card?  Well, look.  Look, the Roland Photoshop's are coming in already from the Springsteen photo.  Of course, the first one I see, Roland with a big, fat...  Well, you've got to start there.  You've got to start there.  A thin, hard cock in front of him.  That's Bruce.  Yeah, you've got to get that out of the way.  Oh, it's Bruce?  It's Bruce.  Bruce wearing a Bruce t-shirt. 
[02:12:00]  And the funny is that there's a shadow across Roland from the cock.  How great would this be if the people out there could see what we're seeing?  Well, they can't be.  How come they can't?  This would be amazing.  Oh, they did add the shadow.  That's very good.  Good work.  Yeah, it's a good photo show.  Why can't they just watch us like this and get it?  I don't know.  Yeah, come on.  Maybe the new people will...  Star Trek, they didn't need a camera on the view screen.  They could just say, let me see what's going on down on the planet,  and it would be right on the view screen without cameras.  Why can't they do that now?  There's rumors out there, Sam. 
[02:12:30]  It's funny they had walkie-talkies and no cell phones.  Yeah.  Stupid.  You should do some Googling today.  There's rumors out there.  Am I in danger?  There's rumors in the air.  Rumors?  This is where Earl would have been great.  Remember him and his word on the street?  Oh, Earl.  What's the word on the street, Earl?  Earl now just spends his time on Twitter promoting black artists that no one ever fucking heard of.  Does he have a lot of Twitter followers?  You like that E-Rock picture?  That's E-Rock's butt crack.  E-Rock's ass crack.  Me and E-Rock almost got you two days ago, Jimmy. 
[02:13:00]  Almost.  We had that exact picture.  Oh, really?  You're a fucking crack, and E-Rock took it a little too late, unfortunately.  Why, he's too busy fighting his heart on?  Yeah.  You were wrecked.  It was delicious.  What?  Well, that was funny.  Oh.  Hey, we might have a Beatles 2.0.  What?  This is, see, this is why you need us.  What happened?  One of the dumb fucking sons of one of the dumb Beatles was doing a dumb interview, and 
[02:13:30]  the dumb interviewer probably presented this question, so now it's being taken like this  might be in the works.  Oh.  James McCartney says he and other Beatles children would be open to Beatles 2.0.  So it'd be the sons of the Beatles getting together.  Sons of Beatles?  And they're all, uh...  Oh, you sons of Beatles.  Oh, that's what I say instead of cursing.  Oh, he's a real son of Beatles.  Son of a gun is always my favorite, but then again, I didn't think a gun had a cock and 
[02:14:00]  balls or a cunt.  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, she'll language you.  I think the gun is much too violent an image.  I don't like it at all, and I won't say it.  Son of a Beatle.  You know who that voice reminds me of?  I finally figured it out.  It's the woman in Jaws at the town meeting where she goes, that's not funny.  I don't find that funny at all.  That's not funny.  That's who that reminds me of.  Very good.  Here's the thing with the Beatles.  The sons there, yeah, they're musicians in their own right, but I don't know. 
[02:14:30]  I don't, I don't, this isn't in the works.  We should listen to their songs.  Do we have any?  What is James McCartney's biggest song?  And we might need help from your people over there, and maybe the Twitter people, so we  can figure this out.  Let's play a little taste of...  I think it's Water Dance, his biggest song.  Really?  James McCartney.  Is what?  Water Dance.  Are you, are you...  I made that up, yeah.  I think it was, uh, Day Before Yesterday.  Oh, yeah, it's fine. 
[02:15:00]  Day Before Yesterday.  Yeah.  All my troubles were just a little further on then.  I wish we worked it out.  I wish we worked it out.  Yeah, they're all just Beatles songs slightly changed.  Pepper and Patty in the basement with fucking rubies.  That would be great, man.  I'm going to try James McCartney first to see if this Beatles 2.0 has anything.  This is Angel? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  This was one of his big songs?  Corporal Paprikas.  Not tonight.  When?  Going to take us higher.  Got to.  Got to.  Got to.  Our next guest is a talented singer, a songwriter, who bears a striking resemblance to his father.  His new, uh, double CD.  Look at that.  Nice, Mr. Ketchup.  Nice, Mr. Ketchup works.  It's his head of the Complete Peace Collection.  Please welcome, now making his network television debut, James McCartney. 
[02:16:00]  Aw, shit.  Paul's son.  Yay!  Hey, it looks like Ringo playing drums.  Maybe I'm an angel.  He's got a good, um, tone to his voice.  He's got, like, a range thing going on there, unless he can't go down.  Oh, my God.  It looks like Paul.  Wow.  Yeah, he's got the same fucking eyeballs. 
[02:16:30]  It looks like his hair, dude.  He's terrible.  Yeah, his hair is, uh...  It looks like Paul McCartney.  Paul McCartney had, like, a food allergy in his face.  Yeah, yeah.  No, that guy really kind of looks like Paul.  It's weird.  Oh, he must get bugged all the time.  He looks as old as his father, too.  Yeah.  Looks like an old guy.  Is he doing a comb-over?  I can't figure that out.  He plays like his dad, too.  Yeah.  Well, there's a drop-off, obviously. 
[02:17:00]  There's nothing special.  But he's not bad, though.  There's nothing special about the song, though.  What's going on there?  All right, that's Paul McCartney's kid, James.  Paul McCartney's kid.  So you take that, you add it to old Puddin' Heads kid.  Well, let's go with Sean Lennon, first of all.  Oh, jeez.  Would they go Sean or Julian?  Well, you've got to go Julian.  You've got to go Julian.  He's a little more...  I'd go Sean.  Oh, why?  So he could add...  Fucking Yoko in there?  You know Yoko would have to be part of...  Julian.  ...to point out...  But it's much too late for goodbye. 
[02:17:30]  Who sang that?  Julian Lennon.  It's about the design of the place.  He actually had a hit.  Yeah, he had a hit.  He's a one-hit wonder.  So is Chapman.  Well, what is the paper saying?  I think the paper's saying Sean, so this isn't fair.  Oh, that stinks, then.  Sean's an idiot.  I think the paper said Sean.  It's like, ah, that didn't just happen.  Oh, what happened?  You want me to kiss it?  Oh, Lord, that didn't just happen.  Are you okay?  See, you put your balls up on the console here.  That's going to happen.  No?  Oh.  Knee cap! 
[02:18:00]  Oh, you got knee capped?  Pay your fucking debts.  Then pay the fucking man.  Today!  I want it today!  You want us to hold your hand, man?  See your balls?  You got it, kid.  Holy fuck corner of this fucking thing.  Right into the kneecap.  Did the foot thing fall on your foot?  Oh, fuck, that didn't just happen.  All right, back to this shit.  Help me.  I don't want to sound like a pussy, so I'll stop.  Sean Lennon, Dead Meat. 
[02:18:30]  Dead meat.  Don't you know you're dead meat?  He sounds just like he's dead.  Yes.  He's going for it.  Don't think better not trying.  He's going for the look, too.  What a rip-off.  Got the round glasses.  Come on.  You better run.  As long as Yoko stays out of it.  But he's just ripping on his father.  Yeah, yeah.  You have an orchestral background to it.  Violins and whatnot. 
[02:19:00]  Where does it kick in?  It doesn't.  That's a problem.  It's got to be a chorus, does it?  Get what you deserve.  Gonna get what you deserve.  This isn't bad.  It's just wispy and stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm telling you.  I saw Sean Lennon.  That song's five years old already.  I'm not going like, fuck.  No, but there's another drop-off.  But I saw Sean Lennon in the park a few years back opening up for, I forgot what band. 
[02:19:30]  The New York band.  Help me out.  Rockers.  Fucking.  Oh, the New York Dolls?  No.  SFPs?  No.  Rock and Rollins?  Fuck, help me out.  Help me out.  New Idol?  Elton John?  Pat Benatar?  Pat Benatar.  Eddie Money?  You, too.  White Stripes?  Portem Baldies?  It's like.  The Furies?  The Furies.  A stripped-down rock-and-roll band from New York.  Help me out.  A stripped-down rock-and-roll band from New York?  Tom Petty? 
[02:20:00]  Bunch of privileged kids.  Foundry music?  The Strokes?  The Strokes!  The Strokes is the winner!  The Strokes.  Are they New Yorkers?  Yeah.  And Sean Lennon sounds just like his father, and he's extremely talented, but he just doesn't  want to live in that John Lennon slash Beatles pop world.  So he refuses to make anything that would really catch on for some reason.  How does he think he's going to make any money?  He doesn't need to.  He's got his father's money.  The Beatles' money.  And his name.  So he's like a true artist.  He don't give a fuck.  He could be...  I'm telling you, I felt like Sean Lennon could be giving the world a lot of music that the 
[02:20:30]  masses would be digging.  The masses are asses.  But he's been heavily influenced by his dumb mom.  Because, you know, John leaves and he's left with Yoko.  Can we see a Yoko clip of her doing something?  Oh, God, no.  Please.  Go rock-and-roll circus.  Please.  Rock-and-roll circus.  Yoko.  It's so bad, dude.  Rock-and-roll circus.  Yeah, I...  Oh, God.  I want to hear one of her...  Oh, you just want to hear one of her songs?  Well, no, that's a pretty good one.  Yeah, go with one of her...  She is rambling and rambling.  Yeah, you scream.  You don't have to go rock-and-roll circus. 
[02:21:00]  Horrible.  She was on Letterman or somebody doing one of her horrendous songs.  And Sean had to sit there and just play the piano for her mom, for his mom.  Look at her.  It's so annoying.  Look what she does at an art show.  Oh, this is the voice piece.  Voice piece?  This is in a museum.  It's got Tourette's. 
[02:21:30]  People are standing around going, this is brilliant.  There's like ten people there.  With her stupid hat.  And she's...  She is a fucking no talent.  She's so annoying.  What the fuck is she doing?  She's an indulged fucking brat because she banged a fucking genius.  Stinks.  We can make this shit up. 
[02:22:00]  Why is this considered brilliant in a museum?  It's not her dumb hat.  Some people would say this is brilliant.  I'm telling you right now.  No one.  No one's enjoying it.  Talk to the art community.  They would fucking argue with you.  Nah, they just want to be...  Look at her hat.  It's enraging.  It's so contrived.  Are you kidding me?  She's doing the John is fucking me in the ass sound? 
[02:22:30]  You think she's like pissed because she forgot one?  Go to the end.  I don't want to hear the applause while this stinks.  She, uh...  No, no.  People are applauding stuff.  Yeah, of course they are.  Look at her terrible boy outfit.  By the way...  Why are they clapping?  They didn't know when to applaud, by the way.  She stopped and then they weren't sure if she was done. 
[02:23:00]  She's going to go, ah!  That's good.  And then she walks out.  What a piece of dick.  She's awful.  She doesn't stop to talk to anybody or thank anybody, of course.  No, she's a genius.  How could she...  Here again are the Lennons, John and Yoko.  And the number, as soon as we get the buzz out of the speaker...  Dick Cavett.  ...will be the flight of the bumblebee if we're not careful.  There's all the dislikes in this video.  Can't be good.  Uh-oh.  John had to sit there and deal with this shit.  Oh, wow.  She really looks fucking like she should be on an anti-aircraft gun in Hanoi. 
[02:23:30]  This is called, uh, We're All Water.  This is called We're All Water.  Great.  How about you drown in it?  Oh.  Oh, man.  She makes it tough to like John Lennon.  He's as pussy-whipped as he was.  Oh, God.  She must have been amazing.  Uh, we all water.  Uh, we all water. 
[02:24:00]  If you're thirsty, you drink us.  If you're thirsty, you put us on you.  Oh.  We are everybody.  You are everybody.  If you are every age, you put your babies in us.  We are water.  Natalie Wood don't like us.  The Titanic don't like us.  We are water.  Good if you're thirsty.  Bad if you can swim.  You are everybody. 
[02:24:30]  You are everybody.  We check that coffee.  Thank you, sir.  Horrible.  That's terrible.  Could you do me a favor?  I'm hoping Mike in Albany is correct with this.  He says there's a clip from Mike Douglas where Yoko's playing on stage with Chuck Berry, a legend.  And supposedly Chuck Berry's face is hysterical.  Oh, he fucking can't take it.  Because he can't take it, right?  He's not going to fake that shit.  He fucking let chicks shit on tables above his face.  He can't fake that.  Let's see if we can see the Chuck Berry face in this clip. 
[02:25:00]  Johnny, be good.  You're going to be bad.  I'm telling you that.  He was a cool motherfucker, man.  Fuck yeah.  And they looked up to him.  Yeah.  Stones, big time, too.  All those guys did.  Stones loved Chuck Berry.  He's still alive.  Was he really?  Wow.  Is his cousin?  Marvin?  Marvin Berry?  You know, he introduced him to, well. 
[02:25:30]  Well, you've got to get to the Yoko part.  He's not going to make faces and sing with Lennon.  That's for sure.  I'm sure she has some dumb solo.  Oh, boy.  She was on the bongo drum.  I know everything.  Do you remember which one you did?  Ah, forget it.  Well, me wife, Yoko.  Yoko, she's going to warble into the microphone for a while.  We know John, you pussy whip asshole.  He really was a fucking worm.  Why don't we let Yoko sing? 
[02:26:00]  Is that Moe Howard?  Oh, my God.  Moe Howard.  With a completely silver Moe haircut.  I happen to go back to say hello to him.  He was with his wife.  Wait a minute.  Brooklyn got a little murmur.  He had to have his hair like that his entire life.  His whole life.  He has the Moe.  It's the exact hair you remember him having, but it's completely gray.  To wig, obviously.  What year is that?  It does look like a wig.  He says, my alphabet left me.  Can you help me out until I get a new one?  You can still do the back flip, can't you?  I said, back flip where? 
[02:26:30]  The aristocrat?  I used to do it on the sand on the beach.  He's telling the joke is Moe.  So I said, but under the stage, there's concrete.  If I make a fall, the vulvular goes and disappears.  I think we just lost you.  Fucking Moe.  Oh, man.  Ten night.  All right.  Okay, Moe.  All right, Moe.  Woo-woo.  Woo-woo, Moe.  Okay.  Well, Healy started that.  He smacked the hell out of us to begin with.  Hand me the rake, Moe.  He hit me in the head with it.  Oh, Moe.  When did the other two guys come into the act? 
[02:27:00]  Curly and...  Well, let me tell you.  I was with Ted first.  Yeah.  Then my older brother Shemp.  Oh, yeah.  In 1923.  Jesus.  We were on the stage and I heard somebody laugh.  And I said, Ted, Shemp's out there.  So he walks to the front right and says,  I'd like to have a young man from Brooklyn preferred to come up here.  Why?  With a pair of rubbers in his pocket.  Of course, no matter any city he went to,  they had a pair of rubbers stashed away in a checkroom  in case it rained when he was there.  A pair of rubbers.  Now he comes up on the stage eating a pair with a rub and thing. 
[02:27:30]  And he asked Ted if he wanted a bite.  Ted says, no, I don't want no bite.  And finally the pair wound up in one of their faces.  Moe.  It became Ted, Moe, and Shemp.  In 1925...  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  We were off a couple of days from Schubert's show a night in Spain.  Look at me nodding like I know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Schubert's show a night in Spain.  I'm fine.  Holy shit.  But Moe Howard is such...  He's such fucking royalty.  Oh, yeah.  No kidding.  One of the stooges.  But he had to keep his hair like that? 
[02:28:00]  And sharp as a tack right there.  Tell him old stories.  How old was he then?  Not 25.  I don't know.  He just didn't look good.  Aged, really.  Bullshit.  He was older.  All right.  Are we done with the Beatles 2.0?  These are the...  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Do we need to see Harrison's Kid?  Yeah, we should have him.  Harrison's Kid might as well.  Yeah, sure.  These are one of the kind of things that I would spend hours watching old Mike Douglas clips like  that.  I'd watch this shit.  It's a fucking fascinating show.  There's a prior one I really want to see, but it's not online.  I'm so fucking pissed.  I've seen a moment of it, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Mike Douglas did all right.  The show was good.  It was good.  Stupid Yoko.  Now I'm in a bad mood.  Mike Douglas.  Fucking Yoko.  What was that about?  It wasn't music.  It wasn't nice.  It wasn't pleasant.  It was nothing.  It wasn't art.  And I, you know, anything could be deemed art, I guess, but I have a hard time putting  that in a category of art.  Yeah.  That's stunk.  Stop going so fast, Sam.  We're trying to enjoy pictures.  Is that fucking... 
[02:29:00]  Wow.  That's Harrison's Kid?  Yeah.  Good on McCartney.  James up a little bit to McCartney.  Oh, that do.  Whoa.  Oh, my God.  He looks like Corky from Life Goes On.  Damn.  Oh, man.  He has some Eastman in him, I think.  That's a problem.  That's a problem.  Wow.  Yeah.  Not so much McCartney, a little Eastman.  Yeah.  I interviewed him.  Who?  James McCartney.  No, you didn't.  I did, actually.  No, you didn't.  Bet you a kiss. 
[02:29:30]  Nope.  You don't want a better kiss?  For what?  Someone doesn't want a better kiss.  I don't want to.  What happened?  Ravi.  Look, George Harrison with Ravi.  So I went to India to try to see what Ravi would say.  He said, oh, take your puddin' head back to the clinic.  Poor guy.  Why would Ravi say that?  His hat with gutter.  That one killed me.  Can you imagine back then being a huge Beatles fan and your band that you just loved breaks up? 
[02:30:00]  And one of the guys goes and is hanging out with some Japanese bitch that just is screaming and yelling the whole time, saying that's art.  Yeah.  Then you got George Harrison with the Ravi shit in India.  Although he kind of brought that back to the Beatles, I guess.  Yeah.  But afterwards, he certainly kept with the Ravi thing.  Mm-hmm.  A little, maybe a little too long.  Oh, he loved Ravi.  Couldn't get enough of the Ravi.  I love Ravi.  He's taught me quite a bit.  From a lovely little lad from Liverpool. 
[02:30:30]  Get it.  Four little mop tops.  Do we have George Harrison's kid's, his kid's song?  I don't know if he's kid.  All right.  So then it's going to be George Harrison's kid, and then you got the, then Ringo's kid, right?  And Donnie, Donnie, or it's D-H-A-N-Y Harrison.  Went out the other door, this Englishman said fab, as I pulled up to the hot dog stand,  and there's something, something, something.  I love that.  I ran right outside, I hopped inside the cab.  More like Arlo Guthrie.  I went out the other door.  You know, like the Beatles, so they go in one side, and then get out the other side. 
[02:31:00]  No one thinks they're in the cab, and I don't know.  And this Englishman said fab, and Bob Dylan's 115th dream.  You know the one?  Yeah, wait, what?  I don't know.  Huh.  If you were a Beatles kid, why don't you just go around singing Beatles songs?  Of course.  And go, fuck it.  Why am I going to try to, like...  Beatles cover band.  ...be better than that?  Yeah.  Hit play.  Let's see what...  This is one me dad wrote.  Donnie Harrison.  Is he playing in a mall? 
[02:31:30]  What the fuck is this?  Like a...  Music store.  Yeah.  A guitar shop.  Wow.  This is a really posh guitar.  He can be bothered to keep it...  He's not even singing stuff.  No.  He looks like his dad, though.  He does, yeah.  A little bit.  A lot like his dad.  Yeah, a lot, really.  He's trying to look like his dad.  They kind of all do.  He's trying to look like his dad.  He's growing his hair out a little bit.  Donnie Harris. 
[02:32:00]  Isn't Ringo's Kid horrible on the drums?  No.  Starsky or whatever the...  Is it Starsky?  All right.  Starsky Star.  Starsky and Hutch.  Yeah.  He's good.  His name is Starsky Star?  Something like that, right?  That's terrible.  I don't know.  No way.  Ringo's Starsky.  Bitch, it's Starkey.  He's gotten work over the years.  I wish his first name was Jim Norton.  Zach Starkey.  Zach Starsky.  Starkey?  Starkey.  Starkey.  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, shit.  Back to Jimmy. 
[02:32:30]  Rewind.  You got one?  Rewind.  Did he bomb?  Oh.  Here's a rough one.  Open Bombay doors.  We are here over Hiroshima.  The big one.  In the belly of the Enola Gay.  Let's hear it.  Do you have it, E-Rock?  E-Rock?  To the R.  Were you even looking for it, E-Rock?  Really?  He wasn't.  He wasn't paying attention.  Oh, my God.  He didn't hear that one.  Oh, boy.  You got it, E-Rock?  It was a minute ago.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing? 
[02:33:00]  You can't find something that happened a minute ago.  Stop looking at fucking pictures of Sundays.  E-Rock.  He's looking at pictures of Sundays.  He has Sundays collection cards.  We're not asking for a clip from 2008.  It happened one minute ago.  Find it.  Holy shit.  Spit my gum on you.  Writing his fantasy WrestleMania lineup.  Was he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you got it?  You didn't need to find it.  Okay.  You got it?  All right.  Let's listen to this.  He's gotten work over the years.  I wish his first name was Jim Norton's-  It's Zach Starkey. 
[02:33:30]  Zach Starkey.  Jim Norton's-  What?  Star.  Oh, Jim Norton's star.  Jim-  No, no.  Jim Norton's a star.  Oh, Jim Norton's a-  Oh, God.  I couldn't even get it.  It's horrible.  My face is hot.  Wow.  That's terrible.  Don't you hate that feeling?  That's the worst feeling ever.  You think that was a terrible joke?  It would have to be a joke to qualify as a terrible joke. 
[02:34:00]  Wow.  That was a fucking statement.  Yeah, it wasn't a good one.  No.  Let me say hi to Andy in Cleveland.  We're going to be in Cleveland.  Oh, Andy.  That's an undisclosed location.  Three weeks from, what, Friday, we'll be broadcast live from Cleveland somewhere.  We don't know where yet.  We just don't want to plug where we're going to be.  Yeah.  We'll tell you where.  You can just ride around our hotel and yell at us in the window.  Secret.  I was told it's no one's fault around here.  Maybe not.  Right.  Of course not.  Andy. 
[02:34:30]  I heard Sean's latest cut from the new album.  It's, oh, I tell you something.  I think someone shot my dad.  Somebody shot my dad.  Anyway, see you in Cleveland, Jim.  So have we figured out what we're doing for Cleveland?  No, we're not going to.  We're just going to.  We're going to have that guy.  We're just going to. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a.  Do some parody songs?  He's a guest.  We're going to just stand in front of everyone and let them admire us for two hours.  Three hours.  Oh.  So we might have to do something for one hour, then.  That's why I'm thinking we should plan something.  Larry in Connecticut.  Larry.  Larry.  Going to find your dog dead in Hartford, Larry.  Boy, I'm glad to get to follow that last phone call.  Yeah, huh?  You played that Moe clip, and I saw a documentary on it.  Shut up.  And two things. 
[02:35:30]  They worked for 24 years.  Two things.  I don't want one thing from you.  Exactly.  Fuck.  No, I really don't.  Well, asshole.  It's a Moe Howard story.  Oh, okay.  Go ahead, Larry.  I like Moe.  One more chance.  I want to know if this is true, because I always feel like it's a new phenomenon that  they treat talent like shit.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Tell us, Larry.  Well, two things.  The guy that owned Columbia or whatever was a real dick. 
[02:36:00]  He renewed their contract every year, and he never told them how popular they were, and  he kept telling them, ah, you know, I guess they'll give me, they never got a raise in  24 years.  How would they not know that they were popular?  When Moe Howard walked out of his house with that dumb Moe Howard haircut, I think he knew  he was fucking famous.  Yeah, come on.  Who else walked around like that?  Well, they didn't know.  Down syndrome.  And then the other thing is, you know, they obviously had this long career, 24 years, and  then they determined that, you know, they couldn't do their thing anymore, so they let 
[02:36:30]  him out of their contract.  He came back to the studio a week later with his past, and they didn't let him on the lot.  How would they not let Moe Howard on the lot?  Why was he there?  Well, they said goodbye to some of the crew, you know?  Oh, that's how he's spinning it?  Yeah.  Maybe he was coming back to kill everybody.  That's true.  Happy day, boys.  All right.  All right.  When they're done with you, they're done with you, though.  We all know that.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  The Photoshop's coming in for Roland.  That's with, what, Barry Manilow?  Mm-hmm.  Roland was at a Barry Manilow concert.  Nice.  This isn't a Barry Manilow concert.  Oh.  What do you think this is?  Yeah.  Come on, everybody.  Where?  Barry Manilow concert?  Where are these pictures being posted?  Right now, they're just on Twitter.  The Twitter?  So you can tweet them to us, or we'll put them up on the Facebook page.  We'll make a whole album.  That would be nice.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  That would be nice.  I'm not very impressed. 
[02:37:30]  Not yet, right?  This one you don't like.  No, I'm just not impressed with it.  The dick one's like, all right, get the dick thing out of the way.  And then Barry Manilow, like, eh, eh.  It's still a concert.  It's not really out in the realm of, you know.  Make sure it's a Hall of Fame photo album.  Only the best of the best.  Yeah, only the best.  Okay.  Don't get all.  Yeah.  All whatever.  All something.  A woman calls 911 over Bad Burgers.  We like these 911 calls.  Oh, man.  We like these.  Fast food restaurants get so many of these.  I don't know why.  People are dumb.  These are legendary. 
[02:38:00]  We've had a few over the years.  What's your favorite one?  There was a lady out there in California, some kind of sucker mom that had a problem.  A sucker mom.  You got any of those, Z-Rock?  What?  Z-Rock?  Z-Rock?  He was working on his WrestleMania thing.  Oh, my God.  Did he stop working on his WrestleMania thing?  What WrestleMania thing?  Z-Rock, what did I just ask you?  You're asking about soccer moms.  He just picks up on a word.  On a word.  What was the question, though?  What was the question?  I don't know. 
[02:38:30]  We're writing shit down.  How are you not listening?  What are you looking at when you're not listening to the show?  He's writing his fantasy WrestleMania.  What were you writing down?  Be honest.  I was writing down stuff on the show log.  Like what?  What did you just write?  Be honest.  I was writing The Beatles Kids, Yoko Ono, Moe Howard on Mike Douglas.  Why?  Z-Rock, why?  You keep tabs on it.  Keep it tabs.  So what did I want to know about soccer moms?  How is he going to write down what you just talked about?  He doesn't pay attention to it.  You don't think he was paying attention? 
[02:39:00]  No.  He was thinking about WrestleMania.  What about soccer moms?  Again, I don't know.  Will he write down his fantasy WrestleMania?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's literally in the nerve center of the whole show, by the way.  He'll think about what could happen next year.  It's all right if we don't listen to each other once in a while.  No, but his whole job, he's got to be like.  He's to listen.  Sharp.  He's got to listen.  The whole time.  Get it.  Whatever.  How come you're not listening to A-Rock?  A-Rock, comment.  Are we boring today? 
[02:39:30]  Oh.  Just saying.  A-Rock?  I was writing stuff down.  That's why I wasn't listening.  Oh, yeah?  Do you think he was writing show log stuff, Sam?  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It might have been fantasy SummerSlam lineup.  I don't know.  It was one of the two.  Oh, A-Rock.  We just had a celebrity on the line and we didn't even know it.  Who?  That other guy that was really a dullard.  Bill in Georgia.  How do you know what you're about to see?  Because he was on Ron and Fez and they introduced him to that. 
[02:40:00]  What happened?  He was on Ron and Fez and he sings the news to Joe Jackson song.  And they turned him on to that contest that Raw Dog was having to win the $5,000 for staying  on the phone and he won the $5,000 and then he sung again and won the $30,000.  He won $35,000 this year from Sirius XM for singing the Joe Jackson song.  What?  And you guys hung up on him.  Oh, wow.  We're so stupid.  Wow, we idiots.  We got a huge celebrity on the phone.  Shut up! 
[02:40:30]  Fucking idiot.  Oh, blow me.  Blow the rock.  Go blow the rock.  I think he's a celebrity because he was able to get $35,000 from Sirius.  Is it Ron and Fez?  Exactly.  That's true.  He is a celebrity.  Did he win the money from Ron and Fez?  No, he won the money from the phone show.  So let's hear what is worth $35,000.  You rock?  God, they throw around money around here.  Oh, they certainly do.  But in the weirdest places.  So some dummy sings the news, they give him $35,000?  $35,000.  And you guys haven't had a respectable raise in years? 
[02:41:00]  There's a good phone call, I guess.  Can we find that, Iraq, if you're listening?  That's one of my pictures.  You think Iraq's listening?  Yes, I heard you.  Oh, whoa.  Excuse me that you're finally listening.  A little color balance on your Photoshop, asshole.  You can't just put Roland in the picture and not color balance the background with the foreground.  No.  If that were a real picture, would you have shot him?  I might have.  It's much too late for bye-bye. 
[02:41:30]  That's stuck in my head, too.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's George Harrison.  Weak voice.  I think I tried doing this once. 
[02:42:00]  It's too low.  It's too low.  It's too low.  Now I know where it feels good.  I'm going to cry.  It's too late for the cry.  What year is this, 85, 84?  I think 87. 
[02:42:30]  I need a better slidey whistle at a different octave.  We don't have access to the phone show stuff.  Oh.  Oh, well, sorry.  Andy in Cleveland is back.  Thank God.  He's a celebrity we hung up on.  Big celebrity.  Hung up on.  Andy.  Sorry, buddy.  We didn't know.  God, we didn't know you won $35,000.  Yeah.  You're like fucking SiriusXM royalty.  Oh, it's $31,000, and believe me, I know I'm on like the triple Z list.  It was fun.  The Z list? 
[02:43:00]  He's putting himself on a list at all.  He actually thinks he is like someone.  Yeah.  He thinks he's somebody now.  He is.  He's just a low level.  All right.  Walk us through the story, because we're very, very curious.  We really are.  Okay.  I'll make it quick.  I won't.  There you go.  Do we have him sing in the news?  No, we can't get to the raw dog stuff.  Why?  Why can't we?  We don't have permission.  Why do we have to have permission?  What do you mean we don't have permission?  No, like permissions on a computer.  Yeah.  Oh, that's different.  When you sign in, I can only access our channel. 
[02:43:30]  I can't access other channels.  Why don't you access somebody?  All right.  So we got a lady.  She called 911 over burgers.  Oh, yeah.  Maybe we get the guy back, and he could sing the news for us.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, why do you hang up?  We should hang up on it.  I don't know what happened to his phone.  Something happened.  Hopefully he calls back.  He must have a pebble or something.  Oh.  If there's an agent, they won't give me my money back.  Yes, ma'am.  I need to see if I can get an officer to come to the family dollar and the liquor store  and the IGA store up here so I can talk to them about that. 
[02:44:00]  Right about now.  Why?  Is there a shooting?  Is there an armed robbery?  Must be an emergency.  Okay, start CPR.  We'll be there immediately.  Wait, what?  Right.  Oh, God.  Stay on the line, please.  We're in the IGA store up here so I can talk to them about something that's going on.  In Rockwood?  Yes.  You're at Family Dollar?  Yes, ma'am, but I'll be standing outside.  Ma'am.  Ma'am? 
[02:44:30]  What's going on?  I had ordered some food from Hardee's over here and the food is no good and the girl  told me when I called her back that I could bring it back and get my money on it.  Now she's telling me she can't do anything until tomorrow.  Well, you know, I had to work for seven hours today to get that money just to eat a sandwich  and I just got out of the hospital yesterday and they can give me my money back.  I only took a small bite out of the burger and it's nasty.  You realize, I'd be like, hello, yeah, do you realize you didn't just call your dumb fucking 
[02:45:00]  friend to tell her this?  Right.  I'm assuming you misdialed your dumb fucking friend that you were going to tell this fascinating  burger story to and you inadvertently hit the emergency button.  I have to assume this because there's no way you're calling 911 for this fucking story.  Am I right, miss?  Am I right?  And then, you know, it would go from there.  She'd say something.  I would say something.  I improv.  She'd be a 911 operator. 
[02:45:30]  I would say that.  You'd be the best.  I would be the bomb.  Bitches.  Cece Hamburglar.  Yeah, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  That is stuck in my head because it's much too.  Do we have other calls?  You want to guess the happiest age in your life?  It sure wasn't the happiest age for me.  I would say 33.  Bingo.  I heard it already. 
[02:46:00]  Why 33?  33.  I don't know, but a bunch of, then there was a list of people that probably didn't think  33 was very good.  Why 33?  Jesus.  Why 33?  Yeah, fucking John.  John Belushi.  Fucking Belushi.  Fucking Chris Farley.  A whole bunch of fucking people.  33.  What was your favorite age?  Well, 33, I was stuck in a relationship I certainly did not want to be in.  Not a good one?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I could attest to the fact that I was perhaps also in a relationship that was a living fuck 
[02:46:30]  hell that I was in.  When you were 33?  Oh, I wasn't going nowhere.  I was in a relationship that was going, the express elevator to hell.  Fucking habit.  So you wasted 33.  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  I wasted 33.  I enjoyed, let me tell you, a year I really enjoyed.  I had a pisser, um, like, like maybe last year.  Last year?  Last year?  Nah, I'm kidding.  54?  No. 
[02:47:00]  54?  Wow.  No, I love those commercials that way.  You got these two old bats that are through menopause and they're fucking taking medicine  for liver spots and everything and they go, these are the best years of our lives.  Really?  Yeah, let's slow down.  Better than when you had your fucking legs hiked up in the old Hudson?  Yeah, let's slow down a little bit.  In the old, uh, rumble seat?  Getting fucking slammed?  You might be doing okay, but let's relax a little bit.  Never the best years of your life when your fucking uterus has to be held up with a fishing  net, sewed inside you. 
[02:47:30]  You know what?  You're a prolapsing bitch.  It might be the hovercraft.  Yeah?  The hovercraft are making people very happy.  Oh, the hover-round.  I thought I would like to see a hover-round.  Oh, the hover-round, right.  The hover-round.  Hover-round takes me where I want to go.  Where will it send me?  Right over the rim.  Right over the rim.  Yeah, how do they get the hover-rounds to the, uh, edge of the Grand Canyon?  Ah, that's horse shit.  They were placed there nicely, right?  Of course.  That shit doesn't go over rocks and cactuses.  You see the hover-round commercials there, Sam?  Hover-round. 
[02:48:00]  They're horrendous.  They're terrible.  I love my hover-rounds.  Like, fucking horrible.  Oh, you gotta use a fucking...  Look at Bernice Fitzgerald.  Bernice Fitzgerald.  Enjoy.  They're right by the Grand Canyon drop.  Oh, please.  Let's start out a transmission problem and have that fucking thing fly off the canyon rim.  E-Rock, have we done the hover-round commercials?  No, I don't think we've actually done.  Oh, we've never done this bit?  No.  Oh, these commercials are classic.  The hover-round.  The hover-round.  Oh.  Hey, Bernice and Joy, tell everyone which...  Joy's 94. 
[02:48:30]  ...got you to the Grand Canyon.  Hover-round.  Hover-round.  The old voice.  Now he didn't want to get us back because we're stuck.  Yeah, battery's dead.  Vultures are eating them.  Coyotes are nibbling at their useless legs.  Makes it the most maneuverable power chair in the world.  The old battle axe.  He's pulling a van through the parking lot.  Hover-round gives you the freedom to go almost anywhere.  Almost. 
[02:49:00]  Except the town called Dignity.  Yes, in the toilet by yourself.  Hover-round's licensed nurses will work with you to determine if you bought a van.  They'll fucking suffocate you.  Their licensed orderlies will brutally rape you and club you with your own hover-round.  I'll call you a white bitch.  They'll pick up the wheels of your hover-round and fucking smash your head with them.  Oh, look, Roland's at the Oswald shooting.  He sure is. 
[02:49:30]  When Oswald got shot.  No, I like the E-Rock lobster.  E-Rock lobster in the lobster suit is fantastic.  My favorite thing, too.  I love this mosh girl fucking picture.  Oh, mosh girl was a good one.  Did anyone ever figure out who she was?  No.  Some pig.  Just fucking, yeah.  I like the moshing puke guy with the puke coming out of his nostrils and shit.  Pretty good, too.  Hey, I think we can prove the age of the earth.  It just hit me.  Oh, yeah?  It just fucking hit me.  Yeah.  So how old is the earth for some of these religious people, right?  Eh, it's really good. 
[02:50:00]  Mosh girl playing basketball.  She's slamming down somebody's attempt at a dunk.  I think they think it's 5,000 years old.  5,000 years old.  We just saw the Grand Canyon, right?  Yes, we did.  Most people at least believe that the Grand Canyon was carved out.  Carved out of a river?  Yeah, but in their world it took 5,000 years?  Probably, yeah.  So don't we have video at this point of the Grand Canyon from maybe 100 years ago?  Oh, okay.  I see where you're going here.  And then you can see that pretty much nothing has changed in 100 years of the Grand Canyon? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Now multiply that by 5,000.  Yeah, wouldn't that wake some people up?  I think they are their excuse whenever you come up with any fact-based thing as well.  God could have made that in one day.  Oh, fuck.  God could have just dug the Grand Canyon in a day.  They fucking got me.  She's walking across Abbey Road.  Mosh girl's, yeah.  Wow.  Following the Beatles on Abbey Road.  That's amazing.  I didn't know that happened.  Mosh girl.  Fucking mosh girl.  What year is this?  She's famous.  She is famous.  What year was she?  I'd say that's 2000, maybe. 
[02:51:00]  Show the picture where her head's on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  Oh, yeah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's body.  Oh, that is such the biggest douche chill moment ever, isn't it?  That fucking awful face.  That was classic.  Oh, man.  All right, so the Grand Canyon, I thought I was on to something.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, they always say that shit, but.  Yeah.  Hover rounds.  Hover rounds.  At the Grand Canyon.  Oh, man.  See Leon Klinghoffer and his wife go flying off the edge of a cruise ship with a hover round. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, it's a Palestinian with a remote control.  Getting back to that burger club.  Driving around like a fucking model car.  And off you go.  Can we get back to the burger club for a second?  Ah.  Did you hear in that clip that she said she worked seven hours so she could afford a burger?  So she could afford a hardy's burger.  What kind of fucking job does she have?  Hardy's burgers.  How much is a hardy's burger?  Iraq?  Iraq, do you know how much a hardy's burger is?  I've never been to a hardy's.  He doesn't know what one costs.  If I'm in bulk. 
[02:52:00]  Have you ever bought less than a pallet full?  By the way, you know, we were trying to figure out how heavy those trailers were in the tornado.  Ten pounds?  Well, someone said it's half a year.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Well, we're just trying to put it in perspective.  Because that was a lot of weight that was hoisted in the air by that tornado.  I mean, he's heavy, but I don't think he's that heavy.  Are you?  Oh, no shit.  Now, Ant, I need your help.  This guy's calling me out on Grand Canyon video from 100 years ago.  That's kind of possible. 
[02:52:30]  Video?  You could get still pictures.  19...  Why?  We've seen some shit.  100 years ago?  1912.  1912?  You see video of New York City in the turn of the century, so why not at the Grand Canyon?  Maybe some film.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Come on.  Grand Canyon.  I think it must have taken a lot to get a...  That's some Titanic footage from 1912, right?  Yeah, but that's not video.  But that's some still pics.  We need video from the Grand Canyon from the turn of the century. 
[02:53:00]  There is film of the Titanic, though.  A little tugboat pushing it.  I know.  And that's 1912.  All right.  Come on.  That's not impossible.  It's not impossible to have had film from the Grand Canyon.  I know there's a bunch of assholes out there like calling me out and shit, but this  was possible.  Ah, the Titanic.  1912.  Look, there's video of the Titanic from 1912.  Here it is.  This Titanic ship crossing the Atlantic in wreck of time.  Whoops.  Oh.  Wow, that is fucking video of the Titanic. 
[02:53:30]  That's pretty crazy.  Titanic 3D coming out.  Getting good reviews, by the way.  Really?  What happens?  3D.  You saw it right?  I saw Titanic.  I know.  The movie's like...  Bombayage!  Thousands badly cheering as the giant vessel begins to move from a dock.  Bombayage, suckers.  Oh, these people all are dead.  Well, maybe not all, but a lot of them, yeah.  Everyone now is dead.  Well, everyone now is dead, but I mean, all these people on this fucking ship are going  to die.  Oh, man. 
[02:54:00]  They have no idea.  No ship.  I said ship.  What's that?  Although I wish ship would go down like a Titanic.  They just have no idea what's going to happen.  That's crazy.  I've never seen this.  What is this pushing them out?  Tug boats.  Would they do that?  Oh, they're tugging them out?  Yeah, they push them.  That's what a tugboat does.  They're pushing them.  Oh, look at those poor fucking people.  They have no idea the fun that's going to happen around North Atlantic.  They're all waving in England.  Yay!  Can't wait until we get to New York.  That whole big boat's just going to go underwater in the middle of the ocean.  Oh, boy.  Look how fucking big that boat is from 1912. 
[02:54:30]  Unsinkable.  How big are the cruise ships today?  Compared to that.  I believe, how much is the Titanic called?  Dump smokestacks like that.  Oh, man.  That's a dumb idea.  That's fucking cool looking, though.  I love the way old fucking ocean liners looked.  Yeah, that's badass.  Yeah.  Sink you, motherfucker.  Why the nice piano music?  It's very somber.  Very somber music.  Boy, there's a lot of film with the dumb Titanic, huh?  How about you fast forward?  Ah, there's a captain. 
[02:55:00]  Captain Asshole.  Captain doesn't keep his eyes open.  Yeah.  Captain naps a lot.  Captain naps a lot.  Captain, go to bed or something.  Oh, shit.  God, shit.  Asshole.  Ah, the Carpathia.  The rescue ship.  Coming into part with the survivors of the Titanic disaster.  They just sent it.  Wait, what happened in between?  Yeah, I know.  Why don't they have some fucking...  Fuck!  No one pulled out their iPhone back then. 
[02:55:30]  No.  They just released, sold a photo, an original photo, from the rescue ship of the Titanic,  the iceberg that actually sank it.  There's a photo of that.  No way.  You can't see it happening because the rest...  Google ice...  Or don't stop this, but there's a photo of the actual iceberg.  Really?  No, I don't believe it.  I don't believe it.  How do they know that was the real one?  It was taken from the fucking...  The Carpathia?  Really?  From the ship right after the fucking thing went down.  You see the video recently of the guy who filmed an iceberg collapsing into the water? 
[02:56:00]  Ooh, no.  Oh, that went viral.  That was pretty impressive, too, man.  This is, um...  Sam, you got a lot of stuff to do.  We're done with this.  The Titanic...  Go to that.  Find that picture.  The Titanic was 46,000 tons.  The epic, Norwegian Koons Alliance epic, is 120,000 tons.  Spelled iceberg wrong, you dope.  We'll find it anyway.  That's a lot of tons.  I would think the Titanic was heavier.  Is that it?  That's it?  That's the size of the iceberg.  No.  The actual one is taken from a ship.  Oh, Titanic's iceberg. 
[02:56:30]  There it is, with the red circle.  Down.  Oh, my goodness.  That's it.  That's an original photo.  That looks dangerous.  Let's see.  What happened?  That's all it was?  That's the same one.  Well, you know...  Go back.  That tip of the iceberg is just the tip of the iceberg.  I understand.  That's a shitty iceberg.  Yeah, that is a shitty iceberg.  Go back.  It's not impressive.  They speculate if the Titanic had not tried to turn away and hit the iceberg head-on, that 
[02:57:00]  it would not have sank.  Why?  Because it wouldn't have flooded as many compartments.  It just would have flooded the front compartment.  But the fact that it slid by the iceberg and tore open the side, it opened up, I think,  more than three compartments.  But if it went over, it wouldn't have just ripped the whole bottom of the boat?  No, it wouldn't have gone over it.  It would have just smashed into it and completely crumbled the front of the ship, but it wouldn't  have sunk, so they say.  Oh, it would have stopped?  Yeah, it just would have stopped, like, clunk, oh boy.  You could have just said it because of the pointy part of the... 
[02:57:30]  The pointy part.  Of the Titanic.  Of course, the pointy part.  The pointy part would have hit first.  Yeah.  I'd be afraid the rescue boat was going to sink.  Man, imagine that shit.  I'd be like, oh, fuck, I gotta do this again.  Get to the lifeboat.  Could you get the video of the iceberg that was filmed recently?  A bunch of guys and gals on a little boat checking out icebergs in Alaska.  Yeah, people are calling you out on the video thing.  Why?  It would be film, because video... 
[02:58:00]  Oh, yeah, but we all know just video now.  Why do they have to be so technical?  It's very relatively new, I believe, in the 60s.  All right, film.  Oh, is that why maybe that guy was laughing at me?  Maybe.  All right, but I was...  Oh, man, they're going to get a wave, I bet, huh?  I don't know if this is the one.  The glacier.  So that guy is right, film.  I just got to film for the great kind of thing.  I wish the audience could see this.  Oh, that's right.  This isn't the one I saw.  This might be another one.  Fucking glaciers.  There ain't no stopping them.  No, look, Sam, look at all the dislikes. 
[02:58:30]  Obviously, this isn't the good one.  There's two dislikes on it.  It's a piece of snow.  No, this isn't the one.  Does it fall?  The boat took off, man.  It was in the distance as the boat was trying to get the fuck away.  Holy shoot.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  I don't know.  Do you have anything else about the iceberg video?  What happened?  Where's the iceberg falling?  I don't know.  Where's the boat speeding?  I don't know.  Let me check my phone.  Oh, my goodness.  Come on.  There's something tweeted by now.  Hold on.  Where is it? 
[02:59:00]  There you go.  Right there.  Glacier.  Glacier.  That's not it, either.  That looks like a pretty good-sized glacier right there.  All right.  That could be good, though.  Glacier.  Wow.  I'm nodding off at these glacier fucking videos.  Glaciers are boring.  They suck.  They slow.  Glacier.  They don't move fast.  Rock's nickname.  Oh, man.  That doesn't even make sense.  I'm sorry, sir.  No.  Not a glacier.  He's heavier.  He's heavier.  He's heavier than a glacier? 
[02:59:30]  Shit.  All right.  Here it is.  Which one is it?  Is this it?  Yeah.  That's the one?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's not it.  Oh.  The glacier's got all cracks in it.  It's broken.  I don't remember now.  We're actually watching glaciers crack on the radio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The listeners can't see any of it?  It's great.  We did a very visual show today.  Someone should notice that down the hall.  It's a good element.  I don't know where it is.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  I do.  You do know?  No, I care, though. 
[03:00:00]  Oh.  Find it.  I gotta go act.  I gotta go act today.  Go act.  With Joe DeRosa.  I'm not saying where.  What are you, silly?  What's the project?  Project Joe DeRosa.  We gotta, um...  It's called Two Queers.  Yeah.  It might as well be me and Joe DeRosa.  I'm lying to a Phil Collins concert.  That's like the bit.  And then we gotta do it.  But there's like a bunch of extras.  You would never go to a Phil Collins show.  I know.  That's why I'm acting.  Exploding Iceberg.  What do I do with my hands, Jimmy?  What should I do with my hands? 
[03:00:30]  One hand around your neck, the other around your cock, and then just come all over.  Come on, Sam.  You're ruining the bit.  Sam, you are the worst.  You really are.  There you go.  You guys want to...  Yes.  Exploding Iceberg in Antarctica.  Exploding Iceberg in Antarctica.  Yes.  Hey, I got it on my phone.  You want to look at it on my phone?  I'm going to...  Oh, great.  Oh, what is this now?  A commercial, too?  I'll be ready.  There's a rabbit in a title.  I'm going to skip the ad, if that's okay.  Yes, please.  Or a tortoise and a hare.  Is this it?  Oh, this might be it.  Yeah, this might be it.  Exploding Iceberg in Antarctica on YouTube. 
[03:01:00]  Imagine if you were standing under that thing.  Watch.  Why is it taking so long?  The middle.  The middle is like kind of collapsing.  Like, oh, look.  We get to see something cool today.  Oh, it's like an arch in the middle.  Yep.  An arch has been carved.  Yep.  And some of the pieces are falling.  A little bit.  From the arch.  Going under that would suck.  It's been there forever.  If it fell on, tell you.  Whoa.  Whoa, that's pretty wild.  Whoa, and they're getting pummeled with ice bricks.  And they just take off like, fuck that. 
[03:01:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Fucking ice blocks were flying at them.  You don't see that every day.  See, wasn't that worth it?  I've seen that once.  Even though we do a radio show.  No, you didn't see that shit.  I got a video.  I got a video.  Oh, I've seen that.  Yeah.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Icebergs and shit.  On the YouTube.  All right.  Where are they going?  It's not chasing them.  It's not a swarm of bees, you assholes.  They're fucking zipping away like it's following them.  Yeah, they really are frightened. 
[03:02:00]  Maybe it made a big wave that they're trying to get away from.  I would think that would make a giant wave.  Oh, there is a wave coming, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's like a tsunami.  Is that a wave coming?  Oh, that is a wave.  Are they outrunning the wave?  It's like the Genesis wave and the Enterprise trying to get away from it.  All right.  Turn around.  Get your bow into the wave.  That was pretty cool, right?  I don't know.  That's what they say.  They don't say face the wave?  Well, yeah.  You bow.  Get your nose in there.  Get a bow to a wave.  No, I wouldn't. 
[03:02:30]  I got on my phone now.  Oh, good.  Same video we just watched.  I got on my phone now.  Now we're playing the phone version.  I got on my phone now.  Ah.  You already watched it.  Yeah, that is on the phone.  Thanks to Puddle of AIDS, I'll be tweeting this shit right the fuck now.  I already Twittered it.  No, you didn't.  It's on our Facebook.  No, I want to be the one.  Go to Facebook.  Oh, boy.  You're slow.  Fuck.  Get some more Photoshop.  I'm going to take Not Sam out of this tweet, though.  Why?  Where's Roland?  Show me the Photoshop of Roland.  Display this. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, it's Bruce and Roland.  He's sticking out of Bruce's back pocket from Born in the USA.  Just talking.  And now we got...  Oh, it's Roland with his head sewn on the fat E-Rock picture.  Are there a lot of those fat E-Rock pictures?  Where'd they get the naked picture of you?  Oh, man.  E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Why would you pose naked like that?  He's saying it's real.  It really is a good question.  He's saying it's real.  What was the other thing we had to tweet today?  Crazy.  Oh, the holy shoot guy. 
[03:03:30]  Holy shoot.  Where do I find holy shoot guy?  Holy moly.  It's up on our face.  Holy moly.  Bobo's standing there.  That's a great one.  That is a good one.  Look at his European underwear.  Why was he wearing me that?  All right.  It's plug time.  Plug time, everyone.  Plug time.  What are we plugging?  Because we go now.  It's plug time.  Well, my plugs are as follows.  Oh.  April 12th through 14th.  Yep.  A young day.  I will be appearing. 
[03:04:00]  In the nation's capital.  It's exhausting.  In Washington, D.C.  I will be performing at the Improvisation Comedy Club.  April 12th, 13th.  Oh, my God.  Please.  Please.  Please. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Breathe.  And 14th.  Wow.  We're watching sleep at me in front of our own eyes.  In April 19th through 21, the Cincinnati Funny Bone.  Nice.  That's all I got, motherfuckers.  All right.  If that's it, then that's it.  We go home now.  We could do another five.  No, because with commercials, that means we did overtime ready.  Yeah, get the fuck out of here, see him.  We'll play some club music or something.  No, we did that yesterday.  What do we look like?  We're going to milk this thing?  No.  Today was TV day. 
[03:05:00]  We did TV day today.  Oh, and of course.  A lot of visual bits.  Who do you think's the guy who posted the picture, the Photoshop with Bobo in his underwear?  Who?  Kurt Love, Bobo's boyfriend.  Oh, his boyfriend.  Right.  I don't know if they're still dating, but they were for a while.  Cute couple, really.  They are a good couple.  Yeah.  I'm officially blocking Bobo.  Why is that?  Right about now.  Why would he do?  He's been blocked for a while, right?  No.  I let him slide, but the guy just...  Is he still tweeting you? 
[03:05:30]  He's personally blaming me because he hasn't been on the show lately.  I'm not putting up with that shit.  I don't understand something, though.  Right.  We quote the Bobo.  Bobo Man.  Somebody probably has his password.  We play a lot of bits from the Bobo, yet we don't want to have the Bobo on.  Why is that?  I feel like his pride is passed.  When we play the bits, it's stuff we know worked.  Yeah.  You know, he's...  Yeah.  And the last bunch of times he's come in here, it's been bad.  Has it? 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, it's been bad.  It's been really shitty.  There was like an overexposure thing happening.  Well, there's always...  I think there's always a...  Always like this thing that...  It's like, oh, bring Bobo in so we can talk about that.  Well, you don't have to just let Bobo be Bobo.  Should we bring him in on Friday?  Right, Bobo?  You want to do an old-fashioned Friday, Bobo?  No.  Yeah.  Come in and...  Yeah.  Does that mean we get to go home?  No.  Damn it.  What's the matter?  Iraqi's shaking his head like, no, no, no.  I don't think we need that.  No?  You know what I was annoyed about?  Bobo, last time he was here, Troy didn't let Bobo in his studio, and I wanted the tape 
[03:06:30]  of Bobo having to work with Paul and Troy at the same time, because Troy would get so  mad.  Oh.  But Troy didn't let Bobo in.  Why would Troy get mad?  Why would Troy be Bobo?  Because Troy hates Bobo and he hates Paul.  Bobo be Bobo.  Bobo be Bobo.  Sam, I know what you're doing.  What?  You're trying to get us to 10.  I'm just bringing up...  You son of a bitch.  I'm just bringing up...  You son of a bitch.  Compelling conversation.  You son of a bitch.  I'm packing my bags, bitch. 
[03:07:00]  It is a compelling conversation point.  Would you like to end with some Bobo?  Bobo Man?  I think so.  I think that's annoying.  All right, fine.  I don't give a fuck.  Bobo Man to O-N-N-O.  Bobo Man to O-N-N-A.  Let me on the show. 
[03:07:30]  Just let me right back on.  10.  Bobo Man to O-N-N-A.  7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3.  This is Bobo Man to O-N-N-A. 
[03:08:00]  I swear that I'm not dead.  Won't you let me just do something on the air?  My dog's named Mr. Maloonigan's, I swear. 
[03:08:30]  This is O-N-A to Bobo Man.  We think you're really great.  Even though your dick is small and you seem gay.  You fucked your brother once, but that's okay.  But they won't let me come back on their damn show. 
[03:09:00]  I'm not lying.  Sorry about that.  Bobo Man's not dead.  No matter what the haters said.  No matter what the haters said. 
[03:09:30]  I blow my IQ's in a double digits.  I'm smart enough to know.  It's okay to do things when it's for the show. 
[03:10:00]  Mr. Maloonigan's, I love you very much.  I blow him.  Bobo Man to O-N-A.  Your show needs help.  There's something wrong.  Why am I banned?  Why are you mean?  Can you hear me, O-N-A?  Can you hear me, O-N-A?  Can you hear me, O-N-A? 
[03:10:30]  What, can you hear me or not, right?  Fuck, the O-P and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  But if you feel like sticking around after one day live is next.  Next.  Next.  Hit me! </pre>
