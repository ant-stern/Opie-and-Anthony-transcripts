<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts and Jim Norton complaining about their perceived lack of appreciation from XM Satellite Radio, likening their situation to a superior, overlooked product (like a Twinkie) overshadowed by inferior competitors.  They then recounted a humorous, albeit violent, altercation they witnessed between two cab drivers.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the fallout from a listener holding up an Opie and Anthony sign during a live WCBS-TV news segment, resulting in reporter Arthur Chien's firing for using profanity on air. Opie and Anthony sarcastically dissected news coverage of the incident, particularly lambasting the New York Times for perceived bias and inaccuracies, using highly offensive language to describe the reporters and their articles.  They vehemently denied instructing the listener to provoke Chien.  This led to a heated exchange with a caller, Mitch from Montreal, and other Canadian callers, involving numerous insults and name-calling.  The segment concluded with a song and a discussion about the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and finalist Pat from Minaki.

The next segment began with Robert, a Canadian listener, explaining his illegal access to XM radio.  The hosts then shifted to Christian Slater's arrest, offering vulgar speculation about the incident and the alleged victim's appearance.  They moved on to another listener stunt, this time involving a highly offensive sign displayed during a Fox 25 news segment.  "Whackbag," the responsible listener, was interviewed, giving a rambling, intoxicated account of his actions and a subsequent car chase.  A brief audio clip from the news segment was played.  The conversation included a listener's accidental groping, a digression on oatmeal, and further discussion of Arthur Chien's firing. The hosts detailed the guidelines for their "assault on the media" campaign, emphasizing the discouragement of profanity and physical contact, and showed listener-submitted videos of media disruptions.  A substantial portion featured Jim Ryan's retirement from Fox 5, including a clip of his farewell.  The segment concluded with discussion of a "Honeymooners" remake, box office numbers for "The Longest Yard" and "Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith," and a rushed goodbye to Ricky, a departing staff member.  Throughout, numerous callers contributed to the chaotic, comedic conversation, including audio from Bob Kelly discussing his knee injury on Jimmy Kimmel.

A considerable portion of the following segment was dedicated to a negative review of Adam Sandler's "The Longest Yard" remake, with listeners calling in to express their disdain.  Other films like "50 First Dates," "Spanglish," "Monster-in-Law," "Kicking & Screaming," and "Bewitched" were also criticized.  Rotten Tomatoes was referenced frequently.  This transitioned into a graphic discussion, involving a caller's detailed description of the erotic scenes in "Swimming Pool," including explicit details of nudity and sexual acts.  The conversation shifted to friendships and therapy, including a host's reluctance to make new friends and an awkward encounter with Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly called in, discussing his knee injury and the South Beach diet.  The segment ended with more movie reviews and continued discussion of friendship and therapy; audio of Bob Kelly's knee injury was mentioned.

Opie's struggles with friendship and a recent move dominated the next segment. He recounted experiences with a cheap housekeeper, declining a ride on Fareed Zakaria's Learjet, and an awkward encounter with Barry Williams, suggesting a possible romantic advance.  Listener calls, including crude jokes from Dane and a moving crew horror story from Jimmy, added to the chaos.  The conversation revisited Opie's strained friendship with Bob Kelly and included numerous anecdotes about his past moving experiences, cat-related mishaps (including cats falling from windows and one covered in maggots), his ex-wife's love of cats versus his hatred, and several stories of lost or damaged possessions.  Bob Kelly, scheduled for a later in-studio appearance, called in, as did Judy, who recounted Opie's destructive behavior at her mother-in-law's house.  The segment concluded with a live studio guest appearance by Pat, the hot dog eating contest competitor, discussing his strategies and the competitive eating world, along with advertisements for Gamefly.com and OAVirus.com.

The final segment heavily featured Pat, the hot dog eating competitor, discussing his Philadelphia qualifier, mentioning a CBS news crew that only focused on him once he was winning.  He described the contest as intense and speculated on Kobayashi's winning strategy (jokingly suggesting radiation).  Pat suggested possible nicknames and joked about eating his competitor.  He then delivered a news segment about a 9-year-old girl arrested for stabbing another girl, a Long Island man who beat and chained his wife while keeping leopards in his basement, and the announcement of new Live Aid concerts. The hosts interjected with comments and jokes.  The show ended with a goodbye to intern Ricky.

[00:03:30]  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us. 
[00:04:00]  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that back.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down syndrome children.  Down syndrome children.  Down syndrome children.  Down syndrome children.  Down syndrome children.  Down syndrome children.  It's terrible.  The opening and the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I want to ask you a bunch of questions. 
[00:04:30]  I want to ask you a bunch of questions.  I want to have them answered immediately.  Okay, terrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:05:00]  The O and A virus spreading across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  There we are.  We're back.  The show that the company's trying to hide.  That's it.  Huck it away somewhere in a dark corner.  Never to acknowledge it anywhere.  But we're here.  Hey.  We're here.  Doing very well.  People coming on board every day.  Getting bigger every day.  Happy with the program.  The listeners.  We're hearing from people all over the country. 
[00:05:30]  And, I don't know.  Tuck it away.  Keep it quiet.  Mum's the word.  Unbelievable.  Yes.  Keep it on the QT.  Ropey and Anthony on XM.  Keep it under your hat.  Keep it under your hat.  Mum's the word.  Mum's the word.  Ixnay on the O-yay, A-yay. 
[00:06:00]  That's kind of disheartening.  I've got to be honest with you.  A little bit.  When there's big stockholder meetings going on.  And CEOs making appearances all over TV.  And you're not acknowledged at all.  It's kind of disheartening.  When CEOs are asked questions about the company.  Maybe asked about another company.  And what they have.  And then what we have to counter. 
[00:06:30]  And, I don't know.  We're not brought up.  Not even a mention.  It's like a comparison thing.  You know.  If one company has something.  You know.  If you have the Twinkie.  And you want to combat the Twinkie.  If you're Little Debbie.  You say, you know.  The cream filled snack cake.  You bring that up.  We're like the cream filled snack cake.  That no one knows about.  Bring it up.  You don't counter a Twinkie with a yodel.  You don't say, well, we have the yodel. 
[00:07:00]  That's not a Twinkie.  That's like a chocolate cakey creamy swirl.  Why not bring up O&A?  Another thing you don't counter the Twinkie with is Bob Edwards.  Right.  We have Bob Edwards.  What about Howard Stern?  Aha.  Bob Edwards.  We have him.  What are you going to do?  We're used to this position.  Oh, man.  Are we used to this.  We're used to working for companies that just don't want us around.  So we'll continue doing our job.  And we'll be very successful.  And then we'll still get no credit. 
[00:07:30]  Over the years, I've noticed we tend to hook ourselves up with companies that would rather not have us around.  But through some reason, they have to have us around.  It's one of those things.  Oh, boy.  Well, why don't we just not hire him?  No, no.  We have to have him here.  Because, God forbid, they're somewhere else.  Yeah, we are the show that they hire to keep away from the competition.  Keep away from the competition.  But then they hire us, and then they're not proud to have us. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, they're not proud to have us.  That's what it is.  It's so fucked up.  It's amazing.  They kind of want us.  They like having us because we're not somewhere else bashing them.  But they're not very proud.  And, boy, if we were somewhere else, would we be bashing them?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Would we be bashing?  Yeah, well, what are you going to do?  A room full of awful piranhas.  Whoever the fucking logo is behind us, that's who we love. 
[00:08:30]  Our loyalty stinks.  Well, no one has loyalty to us.  No, I know.  You know?  It's so funny.  They want us down in Washington once a month, and then we go down there.  And I was walking around going, why are we here?  Management fled the compound.  Why are we here?  We didn't take one meeting.  No.  Thank God.  You know, a lot of the guys in big positions down there, they all had excuses why they couldn't meet with us.  So I'm sitting there going, well, couldn't we have just done this in New York, our radio show? 
[00:09:00]  Yes.  I mean, logically, I think we go down to Washington, D.C. to kind of connect with the people down there, right?  Maybe take a few meetings.  Not a lot, because Anthony hates that.  I hate it.  Maybe get some FaceTime.  We got absolutely no FaceTime.  No one cared we were there.  So then I'm thinking, well, why are we bothering even going down there?  I was out like 11, 10 on a daily basis.  We get done, boom, out.  I don't know.  I just don't see the pride in the program that I see, you know, for other programs. 
[00:09:30]  It's a situation we're used to, though.  We've been here before.  It is conscious.  It's not a mistake.  All right.  Well, we're back here in New York City.  And we have lots to do today on the program.  We got to start, though.  We're all in the office just kind of hanging out, getting ready for another fine program.  I was downstairs.  I was walking in.  Yeah, you got to see the thing live, right?  I got to see it at street level.  Well, and why is Anthony's mic off? 
[00:10:00]  Your mic is really low today.  Why is it low?  I don't know.  And I got you cranked.  Well, who was using the studio during our absence?  I have your mic as high as it could be, and you're still low in the mix.  Why is Anthony's mic off?  We could barely hear Anthony.  Motherfucker.  Come on.  You can't be doing this like this.  I have you completely cranked, so someone was in here messing with buttons again.  Someone was screwing around with something.  Why are people screwing with this shit?  Mars. 
[00:10:30]  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, Mars.  What happened?  You sound fine.  On the air.  Not according to the listeners.  I got two of them.  Three.  One from San Francisco, one from Jersey.  Why is Ant's mic off?  Can barely hear Anthony.  Yeah, you can't take the guy from San Francisco's word, but you can take the guy from New Jersey's word.  The guy in San Francisco has two dicks in his ears.  I was going to say, he's filled with sperm.  Hard to hear when you're face first in a comforter. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  Now I'm cranked all the way up.  Yeah, well, I can't get you any higher in the mix.  That's it.  I'll just yell.  We'll forge ahead.  I don't understand.  We leave the studio for a few days, and we come back, and there's always something.  There's always something.  I noticed right away, so I cranked you all the way up, and I can't.  Look, I can't move you any higher, Anthony.  I'm at the top of the board.  I will move it higher in a second. 
[00:11:30]  Get one of Martini Steve's ridiculous knives, and I'll get you higher.  I'll make the slit for the pot even higher and push it up.  I'll cut the groove higher for you.  Push it all the way to Jimmy.  I don't know what that's going to do, but why is Mars walking around with wire?  Uh-oh.  You scare us when you just walk around with wire.  Why don't I asphyxiate?  All right, now Ellis from Philly is saying they hear you fine.  And I'm getting somebody saying, Ant, I hear you fine, sir.  And then Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station can't hear Jimmy at all.  Well, he hasn't talked yet. 
[00:12:00]  Jimmy hasn't really been talking.  Jimmy's tired.  He's moving into his new place today, so he's not going to talk much today.  Oh, it's moving day.  It is.  Isn't that cute?  I've been in and out of my apartment every night, riding to the other place, bringing  stuff just to cut down on what the movers can possibly do.  Little Saturn fulls?  Yes.  Of stuff?  How much can you haul in that, though?  Not a lot.  No?  But you have furniture you have to bring.  Which they'll do today.  Bedroom set?  No.  A bed and two awful pieces of beige furniture. 
[00:12:30]  That's it?  Yeah, a couple of things.  You don't have a big dresser?  No, I saw, by the way, thank you to the gentleman who bought all my stuff.  He came Friday, picked it all up.  TV, both couches and the table.  Yeah, Jimmy had an online garage sale.  Yeah, huh?  And this strapping buck showed up.  Oh.  And I didn't even have, I'm such white trash, I didn't even have the TV booklet for him.  Here's the remote stupid, figure it out.  Figure it out.  Just sell on and off.  Save all the literature?  I actually, I found it, though, so if he's listening, I got it for you.  But that was, so I just kind of spent the weekend going back and forth, just doing all 
[00:13:00]  this stuff.  Was he a fan of the program?  I don't know, except he asked me to sign the TV.  Yeah, that would say fan.  Yeah, that's going to be on eBay.  Yeah, he's going to make his money back and then some.  I only hope to God he gets less than he paid for.  You know how happy that made me if my signature crashed it, like $3.50 for it?  That'll be on eBay, with your signature proving it was yours.  That's fine.  And the guy's going to have to get a new TV.  Yeah.  Ooh.  And a buddy of mine helped me, because I'm looking at plasmas now, but I hear that they're  not good, that they burn out in six years if you leave it paused for more than 30 seconds. 
[00:13:30]  I'm just mad at you.  Yeah, they burn.  I hear the LCD's the way to go.  Yeah.  I hear the LCD's the way to go.  But they're too expensive.  I can't afford the LCD.  I look at the LCD.  I'm like, I've been hearing about them, too.  And I'm like, let me take a look and see how much that is.  Oh, 50-inch.  $10,000.  Yeah.  Oh, that's affordable.  You get a good rear projection.  You know, it's still just projection, but they make them now where they're amazing.  But they're too big, though.  Aren't they too big in the back? 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, they're bigger in the back, you know, than the flat screen or the...  Is that why you sold your other TV?  It was just too big.  I love that other TV.  Yeah, it was fantastic, but it was just too large for my place.  It was my new crib, as I call it.  Oh, well.  Crib.  You are moving on up.  So, anyway, we were in the back office and getting ready for the show.  And all of a sudden, Mars, I think, runs in and goes, you guys want to see a fight?  So, of course, everyone just jumps up and runs to the windows.  We're, like, on the fifth floor here.  And we're peering out the window and looking to our right.  And I didn't get to see much of it. 
[00:14:30]  So, whoever saw a lot of the fight has to come in here and help us out with this.  I saw the whole thing.  Actually, Anthony saw the whole thing.  I forgot.  You just said that.  I'm sorry.  I was right there.  You were walking down the sidewalk when it all went down.  But basically, two cabbies went at it, right?  Yeah.  I'm walking down the street.  I hear a ruckus, a scuffle, some voices.  It was two black gentlemen.  They seemed to be African, yelling at each other.  And two cabs are parked on the side of the road.  So, I put two and two together and figured they're the cabbies. 
[00:15:00]  And they're yelling at each other and very close to each other.  One guy's jacket, he throws it on the ground.  And they start swinging.  They just start swinging at each other.  Roundhouse punches.  Some of the worst fighting I've ever seen in my life.  No structure to it at all.  These winding roundhouses that are missing completely.  Maybe hitting off the shoulder.  Not one face shot.  Like, you see a good fight, and they're usually pretty quick. 
[00:15:30]  One guy gets that face shot in.  The guy goes down.  You bam, bam, bam a couple of times, and you're off and running.  These two both seemed like they really didn't want to commit to the fight.  It was like I was watching Hotel Rwanda.  I was waiting for the machetes to come out.  Looked like Hootoo and Tootsie fighting on the streets of New York.  But really didn't want to commit to the brawl.  And one of the guys, the one who wanted to commit even less, kept going back to his vehicle. 
[00:16:00]  They're yelling.  They're going back to the vehicle.  What was the fight over?  Affair, obviously?  Or did one cut off another guy?  Idiots probably cut each other off, something.  You know, cabbies.  They're animals.  And the one guy, even though he went back to his car, the other guy walks back to the car and opens the guy's door and just starts yelling at him in some African tongue.  And the guy kept, he was staying in his car, kind of trying to shut the door and end the whole thing.  And then finally he just lost his mind. 
[00:16:30]  And back out, pushes the other guy and starts punching again.  And again, just laying punches.  We were waiting for the money shot.  I'm standing there with Master Poe on the sidewalk.  And he's just like, oh, the guy doesn't even have a good jab.  You know, he's definitely critiquing the fight.  Didn't have a good jab.  You see the way he's standing where his shoulders aren't the right way?  I'm like, yeah.  Of course.  Of course the shoulders are all wrong.  I can see that, Poe. 
[00:17:00]  You didn't have to tell me.  Nothing.  It was more yelling and just bad punches.  And I'm figuring they're black guys.  So they're probably pretty good at the fight.  You know, I watch them boxing.  Two black guys going at it.  It's pretty good.  Nothing.  These guys are the lamest black guys I've ever seen fight ever, ever, ever.  See, from above it looked like a much better fight.  Because every once in a while the whole gang would be like, oh!  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  From above it looked like the fight was really good. 
[00:17:30]  And some of those punches were connecting.  Wasn't doing it.  Was it?  Because any time you watch that fight,  there's that moment where someone starts winning.  Where they just, one guy gets that punch in and it's over, Johnny.  Hey, we just weren't getting it with this one.  Right.  A little disappointed.  Well, it was a great way to start the morning, though.  Oh, yeah.  Because we're all just sticking our heads out the window,  stretching our necks, trying to get a view.  And it looked, like I said, it looked a lot better from above.  But it looked good.  It just didn't have the payoff. 
[00:18:00]  You know, the fight was good.  You get to see two guys just that hate each other throwing punches.  But I was hoping one would land on the face.  Right.  All cabbie fights you in, like a Tarantino film,  with, like, two guns pulled and they're both dead.  Just both fired at the same time.  Every cabbie fights you down like reservoir dogs.  All right.  Well, moving on to some other things that happened  while we were off doing whatever we were doing, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  This assault on the media is taking on a life of its own, I've got to tell you.  A life of its own. 
[00:18:30]  And the media is pretty much playing into our hands at this point  because they're starting to write articles about it.  It's one of the top videos on MSN.com, I noticed last night.  Ooh.  You know, the New York Times in the Metro section,  I don't know what day this is from.  I guess it was over the weekend, maybe Friday or Saturday.  Front page of the Metro section,  they did a whole column on the assault on the media  that went down with Arthur Chien.  Yeah.  And the headline in the article is 
[00:19:00]  Your Pound Sign, At Sign, End Sign, Money Sign, Percent Sign, Fired.  That's a curse in newspaper talk.  You're fucking fired, it means.  You're fucking fired, I guess, yeah.  But it's Pound Sign, At Sign, End Sign, Money Sign, Percent Sign.  They've got to use cartoon words.  Right, that's by Clyde Haberman. 
[00:19:30]  Clyde's a little pissed off at you and I, Anthony.  A little pissed off.  What did we do?  Arthur Chien.  What did we do?  We didn't do nothing.  Well...  Shut up.  All of yous.  Wait till we get to the second article.  By the way, can I point one thing...  When you're reading, I've got to point something out with this revolting newspaper.  I'll point out everything.  I mean, once again, it's, you know, another reporter, another columnist getting the facts wrong.  Once again.  I mean, that's the obvious thing right off the bat.  Well, Clyde doesn't like us, Anthony.  New York Times. 
[00:20:00]  This was huge exposure for the show, by the way.  Arthur Chien did a foolish thing one morning last week.  He acted human.  Where he went wrong was to do it in front of a television camera.  Everyone knows the story by now, right?  Our own Nathaniel did a little assault on the media.  Held up a big, huge Opie and Anthony sign that said XM Satellite Radio.  And then Cabby from Howard Stern Show, these are the facts, just happened to be walking home and joined Nathaniel.  Some say he was saying sucks.  Some say he said rocks.  Yeah.  But what is definite, he held up his curse finger. 
[00:20:30]  His middle finger.  His middle finger.  It had nothing to do with Nathaniel, who was doing a peaceful little sign holding and saying Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio.  Once again, a perfect assault on the media.  Of course it was.  Just stood there with a sign, nothing menacing, said Opie and Anthony XM.  And the video is up on opieandanthony.com, and it's everywhere at this point.  It's being spread all over the damn place.  Did Clyde get that right, Opie, or no?  Wait, we haven't gotten to that point yet.  So, okay, where he went wrong was to do it in front of a television camera. 
[00:21:00]  A reporter for WCBS-TV, Mr. Chien was on a Midtown Street doing a live stand-up on MetroCard Swindles.  This was for the benefit of however many New Yorkers happened to be awake at 6 a.m. and tuned to Channel 2.  Behind him stood two dolts who taunted him on camera, gesturing vulgarly and holding up a sign for the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Oh, so apparently he didn't get it right.  Scumbag! You're a scumbag! You're a scumbag! 
[00:21:30]  That's all you have?  No, I have a lot more than that, but you didn't get to the part yet.  Oh, okay.  I just wanted to point something out.  This is why the Times building, I hope somebody runs into that building with a bomb strapped to their chest.  I really cannot stomach that newspaper.  Well, you expect, like, I guess the New York Post to get everything wrong.  But, I mean, you know, the New York Times, they have this, you know, dog shit crap paper.  Here we go. 
[00:22:00]  Holding up a sign for the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Opie, is everyone sitting down for this next one?  Yeah.  You're sitting down? Yeah, you're sitting down.  Everyone's sitting down. Okay, here we go.  Opie and Dopey.  Opie and Dopey.  I bet he was so proud typing that one in. 
[00:22:30]  Sure was.  Opie and and...  Wait a minute.  Opie and Dopey.  Oh, I'm a genius.  Haven't seen that one before.  I think you were scooped on that one by the New York Post, my friend,  and you're late by a couple of years.  Opie and...  What rhymes with Opie?  Why doesn't this...  Opie and Shmopey?  Why doesn't this Clyde Haberman call the radio show?  He's so brave and prince.  He is a bucket of jism, and this is why I hate this newspaper. 
[00:23:00]  What they do is they'll typically, Arthur Cheyenne, they'll mention the name,  and then what they do is, for the rest of the article,  Mr. Cheyenne, Mr. Cheyenne.  That is the way the Times does things.  Yes.  And yet, of course, it's just one fucking reporter defending another one.  We know what you're doing, stupid.  When Osama bin Laden is talked about, he is referred to as Mr. Bin Laden.  Where's Mr. Hughes and Mr. Kumiya?  This jerk-off...  Why don't they try to be snide and funny or snide and cutting 
[00:23:30]  when talking about a guy that killed 3,000 New Yorkers?  How about the chimp with the turban?  Why don't you refer to him like that?  No.  Mr. Bin Laden, all due respect, sir.  Why not potty-mouth reporter, Mr. Cheyenne?  Yeah.  He acted human.  Did he really?  I don't think Janet Jackson acted human when her tit popped out.  You didn't see the media defending that.  No.  You didn't see the media defending that.  They're defending one of their own.  It's incestuous.  Of course it is. 
[00:24:00]  Mr. Cheyenne acted human for Pete's sake.  How do you know how he acted?  He's Asian.  There's no facial expressions whatsoever.  Like that.  Mr. Norton's racist.  Shit-head.  Mr. Haberman should have two balls on his chin.  He has an open invite to call the program.  He won't.  He won't.  Of course he won't.  These faggots.  They always hide behind their typewriters.  None of them have any moral courage whatsoever.  No.  None of them can just talk to you man-to-man.  They can't do it.  Opie and Dopey, you may recall, are the geniuses who once broadcast a live account of a couple 
[00:24:30]  supposedly having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I like how they always refer to us as geniuses and rocket scientists.  Isn't that nice?  That kind of makes me feel a little good.  Well, I guarantee my IQ is higher than Clyde Haberman.  Ooh.  Is it Haberman or Haberman?  I think if it was Haberman, there would be two Bs to make it a softer A.  Haberman?  I would say it's a Haberman.  Haberman.  Yes.  You know what I say?  Who cares? 
[00:25:00]  I know, but I'd like to know.  Clyde Haberman?  Clyde.  Clyde.  Hey, Clyde.  You know that wasn't a tortured childhood?  Ugh.  A little fruitcake wearing a fucking suit jacket when he was six?  Opie and Dopey, you may recall, are the geniuses who once broadcast a live account of a couple  supposedly having sex inside St. Patrick's Cathedral.  They're still around.  Heaven save us on satellite radio.  Thank you.  So, their idea of fun now includes sending dolts to torment hardworking reporters.  Shut up.  You fucker.  And first of all, it's not sending dolts to torment hardworking reporters. 
[00:25:30]  It's people, whoever the hell wants to do it, hold up a sign behind a reporter.  Just like it's done every day, you ass.  Every day when there's a live shot somewhere in this country, people are holding up signs.  How many times a reporter's fired a day for saying fuck?  Huh?  Uh, one in the past couple of weeks?  What?  Uh, this happens all the time. 
[00:26:00]  We're not telling people to taunt the reporter.  Get our name behind the reporter.  Make a sign that says Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio and hold it behind a reporter.  There you go.  Oh, that's, whoa, whoa, that's crazy.  You're tormenting the reporter.  He's going to act human and curse and get fired.  The guy had no self-control.  Just the fact that these scumbags cannot self-analyze enough or cannot have the honesty to just say, 
[00:26:30]  this guy really fucked up.  And stop putting the asterisk, he was acting a human.  We know that.  We want attention.  Isn't that human too?  There you go.  You shithead.  This is a quest for attention for us.  This is a way to get our name out there where people see it and recognize it, know where we are,  subscribe to the service, listen to our program.  And then eventually, the CEO of the company will acknowledge us.  We're just looking for his love. 
[00:27:00]  Just looking for daddy's love.  And Fred Reynolds, by the way, who's the president of Viacom Television, said that he thinks that Mr. Chien...  Wait, we're getting there, man.  There's a lot more to have fun with here, old Jimmy.  Okay.  Mr. Chien, acting a human, lost his cool.  After finishing his report, he turned to his harassers and yelled something on the order of,  what is your problem, man?  He left a word out there.  That last sentence is sanitized here.  The reporter's outbursts included a well-worn expletive, one of the seven dirty words deemed no-nos by the FCC. 
[00:27:30]  You hear it on New York streets only, oh, three dozen times a day.  That was Mr. Chien's foolish thing.  He thought he was off the air, he says, but he knew right away that he had gone too far.  He knew he was still on the air.  He couldn't take it.  When he went back live moments later, he apologized, but to no avail.  Before the morning was out, CBS had fired him.  No question, he behaved poorly.  Mr. Chien said the other day, I'm a professional and I know I'm not supposed to use those words, he said.  I thought the station had switched to tape, but I'm not making any excuses. 
[00:28:00]  I should have known better.  Still, under the circumstances, was his sin so great that he deserved a career beheading?  Yeah.  Well, how about us, you asshole?  We're stupid shock jocks and two years ago we did something that got us thrown off the air.  And was that worth actually getting thrown off the air?  No description of sex was given on our show at St. Pat's.  Forget about what you read in the paper.  What you've read in the paper. 
[00:28:30]  What you've written in the paper.  What you've written in the paper.  There was no sex description on live radio.  Didn't happen.  Did not happen.  No sex description.  No graphic description of a sex act happening at St. Pat's.  It did not happen.  We never broadcast that.  But every article has us broadcasting sex from St. Pat's.  Why?  Because your reporters are fucking douchebags.  I felt bad for five minutes for this guy getting fired. 
[00:29:00]  I did.  Until I started reading the articles from this collection of ass fuck reporters.  Now, I don't care.  I hope our listeners go out there and get 20 more of you fuckheads fired.  I could care less.  You're all liars.  You're all hypocrites.  You're all douchebags.  Thank you.  You are completely correct.  I don't think a politician uses those words.  It's benign a reporter and I'm a douchebag. 
[00:29:30]  I think by the end of this decade, we should fire all reporters and do the other things.  What other things was he talking about?  I don't know.  Go to the moon and do the other things.  And I can't remember.  Fuck beautiful women.  Mr. Chien 36.  And wear a hat in Dallas.  Wear a bulletproof hat.  Mr. Chien 36 does not believe so.  I definitely deserved disciplinary action. 
[00:30:00]  He said, I wasn't expecting to be fired.  Some of his colleagues were dismayed.  So were people whom he covered for Channel 2 and before that for NY1 News.  Mr. Chien, a respected reporter.  We're specialized in transportation news.  I can't believe that talent is off the air.  Wow.  Transportation news.  Get on the train.  The doors close.  You can offer your destination.  Back to you, Frank.  Jerk off.  And you know what?  Transportation news. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  An expert.  If it wasn't for all the sensationalism and outright bullshit lying, we would never have  gotten fired for the same thing.  Absolutely not.  Never would have gotten fired for the same path thing if it wasn't for these grubby, grubbing  reporters trying to make a better story than was really the story.  The story, we didn't broadcast.  We took a call from St. Pat's.  There was a couple allegedly having sex there. 
[00:31:00]  And the actual broadcast, what went out over the air, what we got fired for, was nothing.  We never reported.  We never described sex at St. Pat's.  But, that's not a good story.  Right.  So the reporters had to write things like, a blow-by-blow description of pew-rocking sex  at St. Pat's was given on their radio show.  They lied because they're liars to make good stories because it's an entertainment business, 
[00:31:30]  not news.  Their primary goal isn't to inform the people.  It's to entertain, to titillate, to get ratings and viewers and listeners.  That's their job.  And when we do the same thing to get people to listen to our show, we're scumbags because  it interferes with them being scumbags and liars.  And now one of them is gone.  Oh, well.  Sorry.  He blew his cool.  He lost it. 
[00:32:00]  He used words he wasn't supposed to use on the air.  There you go.  More than we ever did on radio.  Ever, ever.  That's right.  You guys never said fuck on commercial radio.  We know how to.  We know the rules.  We know you're not supposed to say that or you're going to get your ass thrown off.  And we're stupid shock jocks, opie and dopey.  Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.  So, Mr. Chan, a respected reporter specialized in transportation news.  Transportation news. 
[00:32:30]  Well, there's a coveted gig you really want to hold on to.  I could be a specialist, too.  So, I walk to the end of the platform and go, train's coming.  Train's coming.  I'm an expert now.  The train is coming.  And if it isn't, turn and say, what's your fucking problem, man?  Some of Mr. Chan's allies sense a climate of fear in the FCC's pumped-up campaign against indecency.  In parts of the country, television stations have refused to broadcast the film Saving Private Ryan  because it shows soldiers at war being, of all things, violent and foul-mouthed. 
[00:33:00]  Some stations have rejected Schindler's List for showing naked female prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp  being herded to the showers.  Never mind that any viewer sexually titillated by that scene probably needs a therapist.  Let me interject for a second.  You know, it's real easy for some reporter to make a statement like that,  but there's one, fifth in line, I believe.  Wow.  Wow.  I'm not saying it wasn't an incredible movie or an awful thing.  Just take it out of context.  When you pause on that one check. 
[00:33:30]  Just pause.  I don't know what's coming next.  I don't know what came before, but just that scene.  That's right.  Yeah, ample.  All sexy and luggage-less.  Let's go to Jerry in West Palm Beach.  Jerry.  Hey, Opie.  What's up?  Yeah, I just want to let you guys know that there's this radio talk show host, Ed Schultz.  He was blowing you guys off on Friday.  He was calling you Opie and Dopey.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  He was calling you guys FM idiots.  This jerk-off, he still thinks you guys are an FM. 
[00:34:00]  What an idiot.  I love these guys that just play into our hands.  They're all mentioning our names.  We need all the help we can get with this XM thing right now.  Have fun.  Have fun calling us Opie and Dopey.  Just make sure you're saying something about us.  Yeah, well, he missed the XM part, but I just thought, I don't know if the OMA Army wanted to attack.  He's on Air America at 3 o'clock every day.  His phone number is 1-877-WE-GOT-ED, so this jerk-off can get what he deserves. 
[00:34:30]  What's his name?  Ed Schultz.  I would love to.  Never heard of him.  Yeah, I never heard of him either.  I would love to hear the audio of what he said.  That would be kind of cool.  He calls himself the Limbaugh of the left.  Oh, that's funny.  I love Air America just because the bottom line is most liberal radio shows were getting  the shit beaten out of them in the ratings, so they had to kind of create their own radio  place where they could all hang out and be comfortable.  It's like alternative comedy on a radio station.  Yeah.  You can't make it in the big world, so you can all crowd together on one station. 
[00:35:00]  Make your own little world.  Absolutely, where everyone accepts you and laughs and agrees.  Yeah.  But you know, guys.  I think Rush is a very bright guy.  I disagree with a lot of what he says.  I think he's a pompous asshole.  But the bottom line is, like him or hate him, the guy's a huge success and he's entertaining.  Yeah, for some reason they're able to get that together.  Him, Hannity.  Yeah.  You know, they put on entertaining shows.  Regardless if you agree with them or not, you know, they put on entertaining shows.  The liberal shows are just, you want to just put a drill bit through your temple. 
[00:35:30]  Most of them are, yeah.  It's a little smug and boring.  It's not political views.  All right, moving on with this New York Times article.  It is in this climate that Mr. Chen lost his job, his supporters say.  It's a gross overreaction, said Al O'Leary, a spokesman for the police officers' union who used to speak for New York City Transit.  To sacrifice Arthur Chen's career on the altar of political correctness is just wrong.  And by the way, I do agree with that.  I don't think he should have been fired either.  I don't think the guy should have been fired.  I don't really care that he did, but I don't think he should have.  I don't think he should give a crap. 
[00:36:00]  Although I don't think that was for political correctness.  I think they're misusing it.  Political correctness is when you have some stupid social sensibility.  This is more of a conservative movement.  The FCC cracked down.  Such a fear of the FCC fining them or removing licenses that they are now doing these knee-jerk reactions using this, what I love, the zero-tolerance policy,  which now everyone has, radio stations, TVs, schools as far as weapons go. 
[00:36:30]  After Columbine, all the schools enacted this zero-tolerance policy.  So now you have kids getting suspended for bringing in things like nail clippers or if you take a donut and hold it like a gun and shoot it at someone in the cafeteria.  The zero-tolerance policy, which is insane, forces the teachers and stuff to suspend the kids  and now forces networks to fire people without giving any thought to the context, the reason, why they said it, how it was said. 
[00:37:00]  If he turned around and said, you know, fuck Viacom, it's the same result as if he just did what he did, which was lose his cool, think the cameras off, whatever.  You know, that's the zero-tolerance policy, which is ridiculous.  Why can't we take things on case-by-case basis anymore? 
[00:37:30]  Guess who did say fuck Viacom?  Old cabbie.  That was pretty much, that was your own company, stupid, that you were jamming your middle finger up at.  That's right.  You dope.  And can one asshole reporter get that right?  No.  He's not a member of the Opie and Anthony show.  He was not sent by the Opie and Anthony show.  He does not like the Opie and Anthony show, according to him.  Wow, that's bullshit.  Of course it is.  Because when he sees us on the street, he kisses our asses.  That's like someone bursting into Mohammed Atta's cockpit and maybe flipping him the bird and going, 
[00:38:00]  well, there's another terrorist in the cockpit looking at me, he's flipping off the towers.  Good example.  Anyway, not as extreme.  Not surprisingly, WCBS and its parent company, Viacom, disagree.  As far as, you know, Mr. Chen shouldn't have been fired, okay?  Mr. Chen is a terrific young talent, said Fred Reynolds, president and chief executive of the Viacom television stations group. 
[00:38:30]  Such a good talent, we fired him.  All the same, Arthur committed the most...  Uh-oh.  I knew this was going to happen.  Go ahead.  No, I can't say it.  You can't, actually.  I think you had it right and you second-guessed yourself.  No, I'm not even going to attempt it because I don't feel like people laughing at me.  I'm going to laugh at you, dude.  The only dumb question is the one not asked.  Am I right or wrong, guys?  Arthur committed the most horrendous incident on air that I've ever seen.  No, help me.  Agregius.  Agregius.  Arthur committed the most despicable incident on air that I've ever seen. 
[00:39:00]  Agragios.  It's agragios.  Shut up, I ain't even going to attempt it.  Arthur committed the most agragios incident on air.  Agragios.  Arthur committed the most E-G-R-E-G-I-O-U-S incident on air that I've ever seen.  It's got your name in it.  That's right.  E-G-E-G-E-O-S.  Yeah.  Station managers are not running scared, Mr. Reynolds said, but there is zero tolerance for this breach of the rules.  To him, the punishment fits the crime which he likened to road rage. 
[00:39:30]  On air, you just can't lose your cool, he said, which is the truth.  It will probably not surprise you that Opie and Dopey, having created this mess, get to keep on broadcasting and to chortle over how they provoked a reporter into erupting.  I'm creating this mess.  Yeah.  Mr. Bin Laden.  We're holding up a sign.  Someone was holding up a sign with our names on it behind a live reporter on the street. 
[00:40:00]  We caused him to say fuck and get fired?  Eat me!  Mr. Atta.  Mr. Atta.  Mr. Bin Laden.  Yeah.  That's how they refer to these people.  Right.  Mr. Zarqawi.  Mr.  Where's the fucking witty banter and the little funny things like that on somebody who you should have some kind of emotion about, you detached scumbag?  So we're worse than Osama Bin Laden?  You understand?  That's how revolting...  They can't say Mr. Opie and Mr. Dopey? 
[00:40:30]  It should be Mr. Hughes and Mr. Kumia.  Let's go to Mitch in Montreal, who has a problem with us talking about this again.  Mitch, go ahead.  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  Hi, Mitch.  Hi, okay.  Are you from Mitch and Murray?  Yeah, you asked me that last time.  I don't know what you're talking about, Jimmy.  All right, well, you didn't answer.  Let's go.  Let's go, Mitch.  Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  Okay, first of all, you guys are dragging the show like hell, man, with this stuff.  You keep rehashing it.  It's like a Lenny Bruce bit where you guys are just going over the transcripts, you know? 
[00:41:00]  And first of all, you guys say you don't care.  You guys are the guiltiest motherfuckers I've ever heard.  Dude, it's in the New York Times.  How do you not talk about it?  We haven't been here.  We're so fucking guilty for this asshole.  The guy's an asshole.  Who cares about him?  Let's move on.  We want to hear like...  Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.  No, no, hold on.  Shut up, Mitch.  This isn't what...  This is...  What I want to say to you guys, we want to...  Hi, stupid.  That's what happens if you don't shut up.  Then we just hang up on you, you asshole.  Look at what we do now.  Just shut up and let us get in on the conversation with you. 
[00:41:30]  We'll let you talk, but if you're going to...  You know, the reality is this just came out.  And there's some interesting things in this article.  This isn't like we're reading, you know, old newspaper clippings from our Sex for Sam thing.  It was in the Times.  The New York Times.  It's supposed to be the most respected newspaper in America, supposedly.  Sorry you don't have a big paper like that in Michigan.  It's only on the front page of the Metro section, so let's not even acknowledge that this guy  completely went off on us.  And I don't really...  Honestly, I don't... 
[00:42:00]  You know, Mitch isn't hearing me because I don't really care if the guy went off on us.  I really don't.  I expect this all the time.  I do.  It annoys me.  These reporters, it just...  Time after time, it never ceases to amaze me what just scumbags they really are.  And this guy's name is Clyde Haberman.  There may be a way to email him.  I mean, if people think that the way he writes...  I don't know.  If I could email him comments, Clyde Haberman, I don't know what his email is at the Times,  I would certainly do that.  All right.  And finally, as for Mr. Chien, his focus is on what comes next. 
[00:42:30]  He is talented and in all likelihood will land on his feet.  He has wanted to be a reporter, he says, since the fifth grade at Public School 59 on the  east side of Manhattan, where he grew up, the son of Chinese immigrants.  I love what I do, he said.  He immediately corrected himself and said, what I did.  What I did.  I love what I did.  I love what I do.  And he said, I love what I did.  What I did.  So there you have it.  The latest on our assault on the media from the New York Times.  Hey. 
[00:43:00]  That's a small little newspaper.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Have fun.  Have fun, reporters.  Because you know something?  We're still going to be out there.  Oh, we're coming to get you.  Still going to be out there.  Isn't it kind of funny, though, that they didn't defend the Hot 97 crew?  What they did was very poor taste.  But they didn't curse.  There was not one FCC violation of that whole song.  And not one law broken or anything. 
[00:43:30]  And yet, the media, where was the empathy for them?  Even though what they did was stupid.  They acted human.  They went for a laugh.  They went for a laugh and it missed.  It was over the line.  They offended a group of people.  And that group of people went to the press.  The press blew it up.  And they got fired.  And that's what happened.  No rules were broken.  No laws were broken.  A freedom of speech issue.  Sure.  You know, whatever they said.  But then, the station gets so scared. 
[00:44:00]  So scared of the negative press.  That they fired those people.  Where's the media defending that?  Where's the media?  They were clamoring to get them fired.  So what I'm saying, why are they not just acting human?  They went for a laugh and it was over the line and tasteless and it missed.  Well, how come he's acting human because he's one of you?  Why is that?  It's one of their own.  God, I wish one of them would have the fucking, which one of them would have courage as a man to call it and just talk. 
[00:44:30]  They can't do it.  All right, let's go to Mitch again.  Mitch?  Yeah, sorry about that, guys.  I was rattling off and I cut you off.  It's your turn.  Sorry about that.  Well, I said what I had to say after we hung up on you.  I mean, this is not an old article.  This is something that happened two, three days ago while we were off the air in the New York Times.  It's not a tiny little local paper, Mitch.  Mitch, let me tell you the difference.  I know what you're saying about Lenny Bruce.  Lenny did lose his mind and did start reading court transcripts.  But this is something that's happening.  This is a four-hour radio show. 
[00:45:00]  This is not like a 45-minute stand-up set where it's got to be boom, boom, boom, punchline, boom, boom, punchline.  This is what we do.  This falls in line with what we do.  When Lenny was reading transcripts, it went against what he did because he wasn't trying to be funny.  This is what we do.  We weave in and out of being funny.  We talk about what's going on.  We try to riff on it.  And we are riffing on it.  That's pretty much what we do.  Right.  This is just a hot topic right now.  It will go away, but we're getting a lot more attention as far as this goes.  So, I mean, we had a huge hit in Boston over the weekend we're going to talk about next.  Should we not talk about this one, Mitch? 
[00:45:30]  No, no.  Come on, guys.  You know, I love you guys.  Salt on the media.  I don't know.  We've been talking a little too much about that.  So, why should we talk about this next one?  I feel that you guys feel that you feel guilty for this guy.  You know, that's what it's coming up.  No, no.  Mitch, Mitch, Mitch, Mitch.  All right, look, Freud.  Sit there and psychoanalyze someone else, okay?  Don't tell him.  Oh, we feel guilty.  That's why we're talking about it so much.  I could give a fuck that this guy, I don't care if he's on a soup fucking line.  I don't care.  Reporters have fucked my life up for two years. 
[00:46:00]  Huh?  No, but there's...  If it wasn't for them reporting lies, I wouldn't have been out of work for two years.  Stop saying you don't care.  You keep saying, I don't care.  You sound like that fucking douchebag Stern.  You do care.  So, stop saying, I don't care.  I care that he's fired.  Is that what you're saying, Mitch?  Mitch, Mitch.  I care that this guy was fired.  Is that what you're saying?  No, I'm also saying, you always say, I don't care.  Could you go outside and freeze to death in Canada, you fucking asshole? 
[00:46:30]  Just freeze to death.  I hate you.  Come on, Anthony.  Go get your copy of Decades, Neil Young, and listen to that, because we're going to talk about this for a little longer after the break.  June 1st.  Ooh, what is it, a balmy 12 out in your stupid country?  I hate you.  Why aren't you at work?  Don't warm up the dog sled and go to work.  You should feel guilty because you're stealing XM.  Satellite thief.  Thief.  I'm a silly man, I'm paying.  One of our nice, shiny American satellites. 
[00:47:00]  That's right.  Mind you.  I paid for you guys on premium the whole two fucking dollars, man.  You guys are great.  I don't care.  I don't care.  My hooks don't go over.  I don't care.  What is Canada launching a hockey puck next year?  Putting it in orbit?  Their first rocket ever.  Have you guys launched a rocket?  Hey, Canada.  You want to hear something next?  Hey, Canada.  Shut up, Mitch.  Have you launched a rocket yet?  You mean one of those things that flies up in the sky?  Yeah.  Have you done anything with the space program and launched your own rocket? 
[00:47:30]  Do you have like a launch pad up there?  We're still working on snowmobiles.  That's our newest thing.  Mitch, could you give your address out over the air?  Because a lot of people want to drive all the way up to Montreal just to punch you in the face.  I swear to God.  There's a guy in West Palm Beach who's like, please give me his address.  I won't even fly.  I'll drive all the way there just to punch him in the face.  Can I just tell you something about Canada and satellite radio?  Yeah, you just sound annoying, man.  What, Mitch?  Go ahead, Mitch.  I'm with you, Mitch.  I am.  I am an annoying guy. 
[00:48:00]  But let me tell you something about Canada and satellite radio.  I was just looking with a friend of mine who was in communications, and we were just wondering,  can XM be brought to Canada?  This was our big thing.  And we started doing a search on it, and Canada bans XM or any kind of transmission from satellite  because they're going on an old European system where they're broadcasting digital radio from satellite, from towers.  All right, we got Ian from Nova Scotia.  God, did you hear that drivel that just came out of his mouth?  C-word alert. 
[00:48:30]  What?  C-word alert.  C-word alert.  All right, C-word alert.  C-word alert.  There you go.  You're on with Mitch from Montreal.  Go ahead.  See, I told you last week.  Remember I called last week about this guy?  Yeah.  He's a typical Montreal.  I don't care if he's French or not.  They're all cocksuckers.  They're all cunts.  They have no idea at all.  They turned their back on you within a second.  Hey, I'm the Canadian that stayed in Montreal when every other chicken...  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  What I was saying last week, you called in. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, we love you.  Oh, I love you.  I get you illegally.  And then one topic doesn't fit your bill, and suddenly, oh, Jesus, you guys are going  on too long.  What the hell is the matter with you?  Why can't you just enjoy the show?  It's good radio, man.  Come on.  You've got to call in.  You've got to spread the virus.  You've got to wake up the people.  If something's happening on the show, now I get to fight with some new feet.  Where are you from?  Newfoundland?  Or Nova Scotia?  I'm from Nova Scotia.  And this topic is funny as hell.  This is why we don't need a fence or a moat or an army on the north border of the United 
[00:49:30]  States of America.  They just hate each other.  No, I'm just saying they sound so wimpy.  They ain't coming down to get us ever.  And you feet.  I have no idea about it.  You're new feet from Nova Scotia or wherever you are, man. 
[00:50:00]  You drive us nuts here.  You're so fucking stupid.  Oh, yeah.  That sounds pretty intelligent.  What a fucking dude.  Yeah, you're full of cheese.  You're fucking geography, do you?  Don't even have a fucking clue.  Do I have a new feet accent, you dumbass?  You're a new feet, man.  Come on.  I don't know.  That's all you got.  That's all you got, you fucking pussy.  You're a new feet.  I don't even have a new feet accent.  I don't even fucking go to new feet.  You're a fucking dumbass.  And new feet, they're twice the fucking guys you are.  They have a lot.  I don't care.  I don't care. 
[00:50:30]  I don't care.  Ding, ding, ding.  Zoom, zoom, zoom.  Is that French?  I don't care.  You fucking new feet.  Stop wasting their fucking time.  All right.  Will you guys hang out, please?  And don't call them.  I'll be quiet.  I'll be quiet if the new feet will be quiet.  Not you, you fucking scumbag.  Cunt.  You know how you break a new feet finger?  You kick them in the fucking nose.  And they're out.  Oh, Canada.  Can you believe that country is sitting right up there? 
[00:51:00]  Just a mere few miles away from us.  Yeah.  It is a whole nother world going on over there.  Wow.  Newfie, cook.  Why don't we play this little...  Please, God, I pray for another Ice Age.  I would love just a sweeping glacier to just cleanse that continent of any life whatsoever.  Bring back the mastodon.  All right, Ann, we're going to take a break.  That was kind of fun to listen to, though. 
[00:51:30]  Can you tell the difference between those accents, by the way, at all?  No!  Shut up, you new feet.  You sound like a hoser.  When we come back, Anthony, the headline reads,  Perils of live TV from the Boston Herald.  Yeah.  I heard about this one.  This is...  This one is really ugly.  I heard about this one.  The Enola Gay took off and...  This one's really ugly.  Drop the big one.  I guarantee Mitch will be listening, no matter what. 
[00:52:00]  Shortly.  We'll go to break with this.  Times have changed.  Our kids are getting worse.  They won't obey their parents.  They just want to fart and curse.  Should we blame the government?  Or blame society?  Or should we blame the images on TV?  No!  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  With all their beady little eyes,  a-flapping head so full of lies.  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada! 
[00:52:30]  We need to form a full assault.  It's a-flapping head so full.  Don't blame me for my son Stan.  He saw the darn cartoon,  and now he's off to join the clan.  And my boy Eric once had my picture on his shelf.  But now when I see him,  he tells me to fuck myself.  Well, blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  It seems that everything's gone wrong  since Canada came along.  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  They're not even a real country anyway.  My son could have been a doctor 
[00:53:00]  or a lawyer, Richard Drew.  He said he burned a black-a-piggy on a barbecue.  Should we blame the matches?  Should we blame the fire?  Or have the doctors who allow it to expire?  Heck no!  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  With all their husky, hummer, balloon,  and that bitch, and Mary, too.  Blame Canada!  Blame Canada!  She was Canada!  She was Canada!  Her...  Let's see how this comes out. 
[00:53:30]  Hey, hey, Bernadette!  All right.  They're right there.  All right, here we go.  This is a story about a man  And he always was so lonely at night  But his voice was rowdy  You could hear it all through his train station 
[00:54:00]  And I'm gonna sing this one  This is about Tippy Toe Tommy  Let's go while we're young  You slayed that night  And now you have nowhere to go  My money's gone and off  For all my friends  And the cop says to me  Hey, you smell bad, get out of here 
[00:54:30]  And he says, you don't have an angel  And he said, that ain't you  Shelter me from the falling rain  You have bombs  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  Shelter me  Shelter me from the falling rain 
[00:55:00]  You have bombs  This is my life  This is my life  I'm living with so much pain  There's just a little peace  Coffey and Anthony  XM202  Every night out  She's my mom, mom, mom 
[00:55:30]  With a rebel yell  She's my mom, mom, mom  Ah, fat idiot with rosacea  He's coming in today, right?  Yeah  All right, we got Pat from Minaki  Coming in at nine to do the news  And we just found out that  What, he's in the finals  Of the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?  Oh, this is a national event  People around the country  Know of this thing  Nathan's, of course 
[00:56:00]  The famous Nathan's  On Coney Island  Has a hot dog eating contest  Every year  And our own  Pat from Minaki  Is qualified  And he's going to be in it  I guess he won  The qualifying match  In Philly  He outdid all those  Philly people, I guess  And now he's going to Coney  He's going to be  In the hot dog eating contest  Yeah, we'll get the details  At nine o'clock  When he comes in  But basically  That's going to be  Another assault on the media  I do believe 
[00:56:30]  This could cost him  Another tow  Well, there you have it  Well, he's a tow truck  Then  Let's go to Robert  In Western Canada  Robert  Hello  Hey, Robert  I'd just like to defend  Western Canada  From Eastern Canada  We're not at all  The same  No?  We're not  They're like a boil  On the ass of Canada  Eastern Canada  You know  Yeah, but what does  Western Canada have?  I know Montreal 
[00:57:00]  It's all in Toronto  That's about it  Oh, you guys got that  Vancouver  That's supposed to be  Really nice  Well, it is  It is very nice  Western Canada  Is a beautiful part  Of the country  Eastern Canada  Always  Everyone looks at  Eastern Canada  And seems to  Think that  Everything comes  From the east  There's actually  A western part  Of Canada  Which actually  Their views  You know  Our views  In Western Canada  Are a lot like yours  You know  You know 
[00:57:30]  We're not dumb  We're not dumb  Oh, okay  Why is Canada  Taking over this program?  That's what I want to know  We're not trying to  But  I would love to know  How many of you Canadians  Are listening to XM illegally  I am listening to you illegally  I can't say I'm not  I love you guys though  And to be able to get you  I've got to get you illegally  It's just the way it is  How did you get your XM?  Do you really want to know?  No  No one's going to  No one's going to  Track you down  Jesus  Well, my brother actually 
[00:58:00]  Wintered in Portland  In the winters  And I used his address  Wait, he went all the way  South to Portland  To get away from the cold weather?  Yeah  Jesus  Wintered  Yeah, it's pretty cold up here  Most people in the states  We winter down in Miami  You know  Florida in general  But you stupid Western Canadians  You winter in Portland  Because you think it's warmer  It's kind of cold  It's better  Alright, well  Alright  So he was down in Portland 
[00:58:30]  Wintering  And what happened?  He picked up a unit  Obviously  And smuggled it back  In a Speedo  At the beach  No, no  I bought one  And just used his address  And they could have cared less  Like, I mean  They just want subscribers  You know  I don't think they care  Where it comes from  Or how they get it  You know  I pay my ten bucks a month  And away we go  Oh yeah, yeah  You still have to pay  The ten bucks a month  That's right  Okay  Well, thank you, Robert 
[00:59:00]  Thanks, man  There he goes  Western Canada checking in, Anthony  Hey, what's going on  With Christian Slater  Is this story just breaking?  Oh yeah  He's had a couple of problems  In the past  You remember  He was drunk one day  And he had a gun  At the airport  They went to arrest him  Another time  That old gag  That old gag  He was scumpled with the cops  And tried to  The cops say  He tried to grab  The cop's gun  I was saying  That old gag  With the celebrities  Trying to get a gun  Through security  At the airport  That's such an old gag 
[00:59:30]  I didn't know  Who doesn't know  They have a gun on them  I didn't know  I backed it  But it's like  You know  It's a publicity stunt  Basically  You know  You think that's  A publicity stunt  I think a publicist  A long time ago  Figured out  Look  You know  You smuggle a gun  They catch you  This was before 9-11  Obviously  Of course  They catch you  It's a no-no  You get slapped on the wrist  Eventually  But you get headlines  All over the country  There's Kristen Slater  Getting arrested this morning  They're throwing him  In the cop car  All handcuffed  Well  This morning 
[01:00:00]  His problems  Were  He was  Apparently  Drunk  And  He was walking down  The sidewalk  Here in  Manhattan  And he grabbed  A girl's ass  Reached  Over  And grabbed  Her ass  It was probably  One of those  Situations  You're drunk  And you know  You look at  That ass  The fine ass  I gotta grab  That ass  I gotta grab  It  The perf switch  Went off  On  On Kristen Slater  Kristen Slater 
[01:00:30]  The switch  It happens  To us  We walk down  The street  And you look  And go  That's a great ass  I wonder what  That ass feels like  But most of us  Never will know  You undress her  With your mind  Perhaps  You know  You fantasize  But you don't  Grab the ass  He was probably  Doing the same thing  That's a fine ass  On that girl  I wonder what  That looks like  Without any  Dress on it  Or maybe the  Panties down  I need the ass  I gotta grab  Before he knew it  His hands on the ass  And then he's 
[01:01:00]  Christian Slater  It was just a stranger  He didn't know this girl  I don't think  He did know the girl  He just grabbed her ass  And then he's  Christian Slater  So the girl spins around  And goes  It's Christian Slater  So it doesn't matter  Where he goes  It looked like  They were arresting him  From his apartment  So he probably went home  Yeah  Cha  Cha hing  He's uh  You know  She probably then said  Christian Slater  Grab my ass  The cops go to his house  And arrest him  Which is  You know 
[01:01:30]  God  She could have just  Seen Christian Slater  On the street  And said  He grabbed my ass  And they go to your house  And arrest you like that  It's gonna be his word  Against hers  Yeah  Well according to  Clyde Haberman  And the rest of these  Reporters mentality  I think that she should  Be in trouble  For provoking that situation  Right  If she didn't walk  With that delicious hiney  Nobody would have been  Hard pressed to grab it  He wouldn't have  Grabbed her ass  If she had a horrible ass  Or it kept it covered up  I think it's a compliment  When you grab a 
[01:02:00]  An ass like that  Anthony  Yeah  You're not grabbing the hot  You know  The fat asses  Uh huh  Oh boy  Wow they're doing a live shot  Outside  Shh  Anyway  I'm a little distracted  Shh  Nothing yet  Please keep quiet  Good luck  Anyway  So he  He was arrested this morning  And it's a developing story  This is not  I'm just looking at it  It looks like  I'm looking at a  An injured gazelle 
[01:02:30]  With a pride of hungry lions  Around it  Just  Just waiting to get  Oh  Just waiting to get  It's throat ripped out  Anyway Anthony  I'm sorry  Sorry for that  Oh boy  Oh no  Anyway  I was just watching  I was just watching  Ah yeah  Well  Hmm  Oh no  Very interesting  You're kidding  Let's go to Buffalo  Which is pretty much 
[01:03:00]  Like being in Canada  Tom what's up  Oh come on now  It ain't anything like Canada  It just snows up here  Yeah  Anyway  Anyway  One thing that you guys  Are missing about this  Story about Christian Slater  How much you want to bet  That she's going to come up  With a multi-million dollar  Lockview  Saying that he created  Some type of mental illness  Because he grabbed her ass  Yep  I don't know  Alright well  He shouldn't grab her ass though  Right  It's kind of like Arthur Chen  You know  Crying  But he shouldn't turn around  And curse  The 
[01:03:30]  You know  Nathaniel there  Did he brush her ass  I wonder  Oh  Have you ever had that happen  Oh many times  On the street  And you know  It's crowded  Maybe in a crosswalk  A lot of people  And then your arm swings  And somebody's  Like coming up  Behind you  You don't see them right away  I've gotten knocked  In the nuts that way  Somebody's swinging their arms  Like they're  Doing that stupid walk thing  Yeah  And their arm goes swinging  As you're trying to pass  Next to them

[01:17:00]  God we never get  Anything done  It was on the air  For several seconds  Said one viewer  It was on a black sign  With white letters  Plain as day  The shock jocks  Who were fired  From WNEW  In New York  After they urged  A couple to have sex  In St. Patrick's Cathedral  Landed on  XM Satellite Radio  Which is free  From FCC  Mandated obscenity standards  Their latest campaign  A so called  Assault on the media  Has already claimed  One victim  Former Channel 25 
[01:17:30]  Reporter  Arthur Chien  Arthur used to work  For this  Oh he used to work  I was going to say  Former  He used to work  At this Channel 25  That just got hit  Over the weekend  Oh  Well  Give him his job back  Chien was fired  Last week  After ONA Minions  Interrupted a live shot  He was doing  For CBS 2  And the Big Apple  The Radio Idiots  Well I never  The Radio Idiots  Were waving a poster 
[01:18:00]  Oh we're not the idiots  Okay  The Radio Idiots  Were waving a poster  Giving Chien the finger  And muttering curses  While he was trying  To deliver a report  Bam  Once again  We don't need to rehash it  This scumbag  Wrong wrong  Wrong wrong wrong  When he finished his story  Chien turned to the morons  And thinking he was off the air  Asked  What the bleep  Is your problem man  He was promptly  Canned  Yeah  God it just seems so easy  To just do some quick  You know  Fact checking here  Some fact finding  How about talk to us

[01:19:00]  The whole object  Of the assault  On the media  Is just to get  Our names out there  And you know  And the fact  That we're back  On radio  On XM satellite radio  So we have  Our suggested guidelines  That you adhere to  And then  There's also people  Out there  That are going to do  Whatever they want  To do on their own  And you know  We have no control  Over that  Sorry  Sorry to say  We have no control  Over that  But we suggest  People just hold up  A sign  Maybe just say  Opie and Anthony 
[01:19:30]  XM satellite radio  And that's it  There's no touching  The reporter  Don't curse  You don't have to  It makes the point  Without cursing  And that's it  That's the assault  On the media  If some nut  Wants to put the  C word on television  What are we going to say  Don't do that  Don't  No we suggest  You don't  But if you're going to do that  Makes me laugh my ass off  I'll be honest with you  I will giggle  I think it's funny  As all hell  When that happens

[01:21:30]  Yeah  I got my silk  You know  Piece of black poster board  The word is huge  And then there's a tiny  Tiny  If you have a microscope  You can see the Opie and Anthony  That's kind of good  No I had a good  Wow sticker  Slept on  Oh no  Oh no my stomach  Oh hold on sir  Hold on one second sweetie  Hold on sir  Oh no  Oh Jesus  Run run run  Get in there  Get in there  Get in there  Get in there you dope  Where is he  Son of a  Oh there he is 
[01:22:00]  Get in there  Get in front of him  The camera keeps moving  The camera keeps moving  Come on get in there  Hold on we have someone  He's jumping in on a  Oh boy the camera moved  The camera moved  The reporter looked over like  What the hell is going on  Wow there was a whole like  There was  There was a whole  Oh poor Danny  Oh god  He had a hard time  Danny had a really tough time  I think we saw  Infamy 
[01:22:30]  Infamy  Like T-H-Y I think we saw  Wait a minute  What  Huh  Oh I thought they were going back somewhere else  No no no no no  Oh man he had a hard time  Getting that sign in there  How did he get thrown all the way to the back  I don't know  He was getting moved and pushed all over the place  Can we get him on the phone  You look like a Jane Goodall documentary  Everyone is throwing their  Everyone is throwing their  Everyone is throwing their hands in the air around here  Like oh man 
[01:23:00]  I think they were doing a story on unemployment  And then  He was in the back of that crowd  Birthday shout out  All right  Wow  Wow  Danny  Danny's on 10  Oh my god  We should have told him to take some Samsonite luggage with him  And throw it to the side  Danny 
[01:23:30]  You know  What happened  What happened  Well you sort of got it on  I couldn't tell it was a crowd  And at first when I put it on  Some black producer or whatever  Like actually physically grabbed the sign  And shot it  Just like  Wrangle it out of my hands  Oh he did  Yeah  Get out of there  Get out of there  And the camera guy had already seen it at that point  So I started moving around to the other side  But they were already on to me  Well basically Fox 5 here in New York 
[01:24:00]  Good Day New York  Is doing this whole thing  Because Jim Ryan is  Norton is still losing it over there  This car is kind of driving off the road as we speak  Jim Ryan is retiring from Fox 5  Good Day New York Anthony  And they have this  Jesus  He can't even breathe  Should we take a break? 
[01:24:30]  We're okay  And they're doing a live shot outside  Where is it?  Outside Madison Square Garden?  Yeah  Right on the corner of 3037  They're going to be there until 9 o'clock by the way  Hint hint  Yes  Yes  So we sent Danny down there  And all of a sudden they went to the live shot  And we saw I think the right third of the poster board  That has Opie and Anthony XM satellite radio  And then immediately the camera swung over  And got the poster out of frame 
[01:25:00]  There was a little dance going on between Danny and the camera guy  Yeah and the security guy I guess  Because the reporter that was there  Was staring over at the side  Where the scuffle was happening  But it was off camera  So then I guess Danny  What did you do then?  Grab the sign away from him  And make your way to the back of the crowd?  Yeah basically I grabbed  Like she had her hand on it  It was like a little tug of war thing  So I just yanked it back from her  And I figured  Oh they're not going to come back to that side  So I figured I'd try and drape it  Over that dumb board that they had there  Right 
[01:25:30]  So I was just kind of holding the sign  Like totally covering that board  But I had no idea  If they were keeping that in the shot or not  It was sort of on TV I guess  Yeah you got a quickie  We'll have to go back to the tape and see  But basically Danny went down there  To try to disrupt the shot  And it sort of worked I guess  What do you think?  If they go live again  Any chance of getting a run through right in front?  Oh I already ran like a block and a half away  Oh you're a block and a half away 
[01:26:00]  Really?  Yeah I'm about to get back on the train  And head over  And then the reporter was distracted  Started looking at the sign  Trying to figure out what was going on  Yeah  I haven't heard the audio yet  Maybe we can get the audio  To see what went down with that  We're getting that audio?  Alright we're getting the audio  We got Nathaniel in the studio  Nathaniel?  Jimmy's still losing it  No I just wanted to say congratulations to Danny  Alright 
[01:26:30]  For a big home run  Oh there you go  Thank you mister  Almost saw at least 60% of the sign there  What a scumbag  Wow  The guy's in the trenches  Take the rest of the minute off Danny  You've deserved it  Alright Danny  Thank you  I want to hear the audio  Because the reporter was saying something  Like what the hell is that?  Oh he did?  Yeah  Yeah he was definitely distracted  The camera guy was really good  He like got off that shot immediately 
[01:27:00]  You got to jump in front  It seems  In some circumstances  Behind the reporter  Is not good enough  You got to get in front  One of the best ever  Another one that we had  Was where  They took the wow sign or whatever  I think it was Big Kevin's  Right right yeah  And just  Walked right behind the reporter  And just reached over the reporter's  Wow  And it covered the reporter's face  Completely covered his face  As he's trying to do a serious report  About some kind of nuclear reactor leak  That was a nuclear reactor story 
[01:27:30]  And he didn't say the F word or anything  No  No  And he didn't touch the reporter  So  Alright  Yeah  Where were we?  Oh we were talking to  Premaritalsexfromwhackbag.com  Alright buddy  Sure  So uh  So you went out to Sandwich?  Yes sir  Are you  Did you fall asleep?  Are you drunk?

[01:34:30]  The O and A virus spreading across America  Thank you XM Satellite Radio  Thank you  We're trying to get Bob Kelly on the phone  Yeah  But he's not answering his phone  It went right to voicemail  We finally got the audio of him  Breaking his knee  Yeah I was listening in the office  Ouch  And I guess Dane Cook was on Jimmy Kimmel 
[01:35:00]  Discussing the whole thing  No he was kind of  I guess they got into that  But he also played a clip of  Of him Dane  Taking a spill off his scooter  Okay  He was having a scooter race  And he fell off  And cracked a couple of his ribs  Like two or three ribs  I think huh  Yeah  Sounds like it was quite the tour  Quite the tour for these guys  Yeah they went on tour  What was it called  Tourgasm  Tourgasm  And Dane Cook  A fine comedian  He was taping the whole thing  For a future DVD 
[01:35:30]  And he breaks three ribs  And Bob Kelly breaks his knee  It's great  He's actually racing Bob  On these little scooters  And Bob was winning  So Dane tries to  Use his foot  To like  Push yourself like you would  On a scooter  They're motorized scooters  But he's trying to push himself  To get a little more  And he gets a little closer  To a Bob's scooter  And then Bob tries to do  The same thing  So he pushes himself  With his foot  Bob's foot  Hits Dane's front wheel 
[01:36:00]  Of the scooter  And sends him in an endo  And he just goes  Sprawled out on the pavement  Right on his  His left side  Right  So I want to thank  Dane Cook  He gave us a little mention  On Jimmy Kimmel  So that was very cool  Very cool  It's funny  I'm looking into the office  Which is you know  What 30 feet  40 feet away  Big huge class office  That we prepare the show  In the morning  And Ben is looking at Danny  Danny's looking at the TV  They're kind of looking at  The latest assault on the media  And Danny just kind of 
[01:36:30]  Has his hands up in the air  He's itching his head  Like oh god  I was so close  I was so close  To getting the job done  Almost  He looks very bothered  As he should  Almost had it  They're kind of  Studying the game film  Ben's like  Well see what you did  Wrong here  He's like  John Madden in there  What you needed to do  You see where the reporter is  Oh Nathaniel's  Making his way in  Hey wait  Is the Buffalo Bills  Of interns coming in  And Nathaniel's now  Gonna  Yeah he's walking  Into the office  To give his advice 
[01:37:00]  And his two cents  And now Danny's  Giving him the finger  Now they're fighting  They're punching each  No  Yeah it was  I don't think this assault  Is gonna make any of the papers  No  Yeah this isn't gonna be  A big one  No  No this will get about  Ten hits on  OpianAnthony.com  Later today  Oh  Oh  I hope no one's filming  Danny giving the finger  His thumb might make it  Onto the camera  I wanna get Danny in here  Now that he's seen the tape  But Ben's like  Ben's like  You have to shock and jive 
[01:37:30]  I just could see  What Ben is saying  By his movements  It's like  Dude  You gotta move over  You can never tell  Ben can be saying anything  Like dude  When I put a tattoo  I just gotta stand still  Danny  What happened Danny  Now that you've seen  The tape Danny  No I didn't see it yet  They're still queuing it up  Oh it looked like  You guys were looking  At the big screen in there  Yeah they're queuing it up  Cause I didn't see it  Oh okay  Danny  What happened  Now we  We're the armchair  Quarterbacks over here  Obviously we're not  In the trenches 
[01:38:00]  As it's happening  We're watching on TV  But we're looking  Thinking  It probably  Could have gone better  Probably  If it wasn't for that  That chubby newfie  That grabbed the sign  And tried to  Force it out of my hand  Yeah but  Like she shouldn't  Even have that opportunity  While  While you make  Your first strike  The first strike  Is the most important  Oh yeah  No I agree  And that's why  I tried to just  Get the sign  Directly in front  Of the camera  Like in front of everybody  I just tried to 
[01:38:30]  Shove it in there  And the camera guy  Immediately saw it  And tried to  The camera guy  Was really good  He moved fast  He moved out of the way  Real fast  She tried grabbing it  I knew that I couldn't  Get back to that side  Because she'd be  Sitting there waiting for me  So I tried to  Make my way around  And I tried to  Drape the sign  Over their sign  But I guess by that point  Cause I didn't even know  What they were on  At that point  So cause there was  A few people in front of it  And there was a sign  So I didn't even know  Where the camera was focused  And I just tried  I figured they gotta be  Looking at that sign  So I just tried  Draping it over  Go ahead  Jimmy you asked 
[01:39:00]  It's a good visual  But we're doing radio  I gotta go  See you guys  Oh moving day  I gotta be dead by nine  So  Alright Jimmy  Alright give us a call  On the cell phone though  Let us know how it's going  Alright  Let us know if they're  Annoying you  Yeah  Or if they're breaking anything  Look at that  Look at that now  The live shot  Look at that  Perfect opportunity  For assault on the media  You gotta run right behind  The sign of his face  That would have been huge  Oh boy  Oh well  Alright  Oh boy 
[01:39:30]  Now it's too late  Bye boys  Alright  Good luck Jimmy  Thanks guys  Give us a call  Looking and thinking  You know maybe  You gotta  I think  You gotta like  Get in there  Like right in front of everything  Maybe  Well I tried  I mean there was people  That were kind of in my way  So without actually  Physically touching anybody  It would have been a little  A little difficult to do  That's a crowd of people  You kind of just  You know  Muscle your way in there  Well I still didn't see the tape yet  So I don't know  How awful it was  Look at the tape 
[01:40:00]  And then come back in  And tell us what  You think went wrong  I will do that  Alright  They have it queued up  In the office  Alright  We got Eric  Queuing up the audio  From Jimmy Kimmel  Dane Cook talking about  His scooter accident  Also  We have the Bob Kelly stuff  We can go to  Yeah let's do that first  We can't get Bob Kelly  On the air  Maybe we'll just give  Give the audience  A little piece of the tape  Anthony  And then we'll  You know  Do this the right way  With Bob Kelly  And then of course  I did see Pat  From Munaki outside  Yeah we're going to do 
[01:40:30]  Some news with Pat  From Munaki  And find out what's going on  With the hot dog eating contest  Hot dog eating contest  Lots going on  As far as this radio show goes  Alright so Bob Kelly  By now  We've talked about this  A lot  Unless you're a brand new listener  He helps out the show  From time to time  A good friend of Jim Norton  And he was on tour  With Dane Cook  With this  This tourgasm thing  And they were doing  A little touch football  Anthony  Touch football  And he went up in the air  To get a  I don't know  To catch a pass  And he came down wrong  On somebody  Or somebody landed on him  I forgot the exact details  And he pretty much 
[01:41:00]  Just destroyed his knee  His knee popped out  I guess what he said was  What holds your knee  Where it's supposed to be  All just ripped  Right  And his knee went  Sliding around  To the side of his leg  And he still hasn't  Gotten it fixed by the way  He's limping around  And he's doing comedy again  Oh Danny's back here  He said he was going  To a doctor  Danny's back here  I've seen it  Danny has seen his  Latest attempt  At the assault  On the media  Yes  I gotta  I gotta  Give props to that  Camera guy  He was really good 
[01:41:30]  That was really good  The second that  That sign was in the frame  He immediately pulled away  And then got so tight  On just nothing  Yeah  It was so impossible  No the guy  The cameraman  Was uh  He was prepared  He's on to the assault  I think he was on  To the assault  And went  Oh no  It's us today  It's us  They must be  Telling them what to do  Like the camera guy  If you see anything  Get off of it  And then get in tight  Yeah I don't really  Blame Danny  Cause I mean  The sign is making  It's way into the  Into frame fast  And the camera guy  Was just slightly quicker  Yeah I gotta 
[01:42:00]  I gotta defend myself  On that one  That guy was good  And then what they did  Is they faded it in  You know to where  They have  It's like cropped  And they have another  Screen kind of next to it  So that just made  The shot even smaller  Yeah  Man  Tough  Yeah it was a tough one  But I think this shows  That we're gonna need  To be a little more aggressive  You know  Obviously still no  You know  No touching or anything  Like that  But you gotta get in there  Get right in there  Oh look  They're giving him  A fond farewell 
[01:42:30]  What's this guy's name  Jim Ryan  Jim Ryan  From Fox  Good day New York  Been there forever  Yeah I guess he's  I don't know  I think he's gotta be up  In his upper 60's  Right  He looks the same  As he did when he started  Though doesn't he  Right  So he's had the white hair  And this is his last day  On the air  And I was telling Anthony  God you never want  To do this show  No  He's just sitting there  And they're bringing  Bringing back all his  Old colleagues  And they're shaking  Hands with him  And they're showing  Tape of him  When he was the  Young go getter 
[01:43:00]  Reporter  And now he's just  That guy  That you know  He's got his big day  On TV  And then tomorrow  All his tapes  Will be in the dumpster  Out back  Oh out back  As the new reporter  Starts you know  Getting his office together  You could keep your office  For a couple of weeks  Maybe you know  Show the new guy  Coming in  Give him some of your experience  It's very valuable  And then  That's it  That is it  He's gone  All of his  Big reports  And all of his  Huge stories  He did over the years  On those 
[01:43:30]  VHS tapes  Or in the dumpster  In the back  As he walks out  To his car  He looks  And sees him  Bringing just  All his stuff  And throwing it away  You're retired  This is what  It comes down to  Some confetti  A big ridiculous cake  With your picture on it  The vacuum's running  At home  And his wife  Is laying on the floor  With his shoe off  Now they bring out  His family  To take part  In the celebration  Is that his daughter?  Yeah he has like  A seven year old  A seven year old daughter?  I was reading about him  Over the weekend 
[01:44:00]  He has like a seven year  Seven year old  And he's like  Sixty  I don't know  Seven  Sixty eight  Something like that  I think  He's up there  This is what  It comes down to though  Your colleagues  Clapping  Confetti  Being thrown in the air  And they slice a cake  For you  And then tomorrow  It's like  Jim who?  What?  What happened?  Who?  Move along  Move along people  Nothing to see here  Well good luck  To Jim Ryan  Real send off  They didn't get him  To cry though  He looks a little teary  A little misty  And that's it  Then there's a commercial 
[01:44:30]  For Breyers  All that emotion  And then  Breyers yogurt  Breyers yogurt  Show him what's really important  Look we'd like to show him  On camera a little longer  Because he is starting to cry  But hey  We got a Breyers commercial  To get to  Breyers paid for this  And you know  And a stupid commercial  For the Black Honeymooners  My god  Does this just look awful?  It's going to be another bomb  They got him doing some  Ralph Cramden lines  And oh boy  They play so well  Coming out of him  Can we get this commercial 
[01:45:00]  For the Black Honeymooners?  This is the first time  I'm seeing the actual commercial  For the Black Honeymooners  They might as well  Have just called it  Something else  And made the characters  Name something different  Because it has nothing  To do with the Honeymooners  He's a bus driver  I guess all their names  Are the same  You know  Ralph Cramden  And stuff  Ed Norton  But the way they interact  With each other  And you know  Black people  Just act different  Than white people  White people  Act different  Than black people  We don't have  The same language 
[01:45:30]  There's different  Language things  Going on  You know  Different ways  Of celebrating  And dancing  And expressions  So how are you  Going to take that  And incorporate it  Into a 1950's  White bus driver guy  It doesn't work  No  There's shows  They should just  Not remake  And movies  They should just  Not remake  No  I mean the biggest  Example obviously  The In-Laws  With Michael Douglas  Was just a disaster  And the original 
[01:46:00]  Was a great movie  I'm hearing  The Longest Yard  Is a piece of crap  That looked like garbage  Right when I saw  They were doing it  And the original  Was such a great movie  Yeah it was fun  You know  For the time  You know they're  Going to like  Make it more  Politically correct  And stuff  And supposedly  Burt Reynolds  Like actually  Suits up  And plays football  Are you kidding  He's like 68 years old  Thinking he can still play  So he's got the old  22 on  And he goes out there  For what  A play or something  It just looks like 
[01:46:30]  A disaster  And now the  Black Honeymooners  What are you doing  That just  I don't see it  Sorry  I wouldn't see it either  If you cast  A white cast  Into black characters  That would be ridiculous  Not only would I not see it  But you'd see  Some kind of outrage  That they weren't being cast  As black guys  But yeah  Just call it something else  Make it a Black Buddy movie  Oh they're back to Jim Ryan  For the final farewell  Ah the final farewell  This is it  One teleprompter 
[01:47:00]  This is what it comes down to  You ever needed it  Anchorman humor  I'm going to admit  I was a little nervous  Before this today  Because I almost feel  Unworthy  Because you are  It's an overused word  But you are a legend  In broadcasting  And I watched you  For a long time  Before I ever came  To work with you  And I'm sort of jealous  Of the people  Who worked with you  For so many years  Because I only got to work  For about seven and a half months  And I wish I could have known you longer 
[01:47:30]  Because in a business  Where people aren't always  Necessarily that welcoming  You want to know me longer  Well because everybody's  Got their egos  And whatever  It's human nature  You've been terrific to me  You really rolled out the welcome mat  And you helped me so much  And I'm really  She's his replacement basically  And I want to thank you so much  For everything  You've been terrific  Thank you very much  Thank you so much  This is what your career  Comes down to  After many many years  Being on TV  All right love it 
[01:48:00]  Now you're in the hot seat  My friend  On a cheap  All right here he goes  His final words  No one will care  After today  This is a little  As I said before  This little  Bold venture  In early morning television  Began  Almost 17 years ago  And it was begun  By a fellow named  Peter Brennan  Who was our founding producer  Who is now  Producer of A Current Affair  And it was  Peter Brennan's leadership  To begin with  That was  That was absolutely terrific  His place  Was  His very big shoes 
[01:48:30]  Were filled by  Another man named  J.B. Blunk  Who did a great deal  To improve this program  Took it over  Looked it over  From top to bottom  And changed a whole bunch  Of things  And he was followed  By Gail Yankosek  Who was our producer  For the longest time  Nice  And it was under  Gail's leadership  That this little  This little  Country store  This little tiny program  Went from 
[01:49:00]  Went from  Went from  Just a dot  On the horizon  To the most watched  Program  In the mornings  In New York  By none  So it was under  To her leadership  That this program  Made its bones  If you will  And thanks also  To Dave Shenfeld  Who was our producer  Just until  A few days ago  He also  Was terrific  Having started here  As a kid out of college  And coming back  As our executive producer  He did a fine job too  We got it 
[01:49:30]  We got it  Thanks Derek  I don't want to mention  Any more names  Because if I mention  Some and don't mention  Others  There are so many people  I'd leave out somebody  I know  So I just want to thank  Everybody  For all their help  Over the 17 years  That we've been doing this show  And for the last time  Have a good day New York  There's one more name  We have to mention  Andy Cooney  Irish Kenner  Andy  Oh  And they just cut him off  Oh they cut him off  That's it  Oh one more name 
[01:50:00]  Andy  Andy  Cut  Click  And that's the last thing  Cut off  He'll say on  On New York TV  There you have it  Over Johnny  Because they had to  Fit the commercials in  Yep  What a bunch of phonies  We really care  Quick  Spots  Yeah it's not a bad idea  B from Cincinnati  Could you all give Ricky  A surprise send off  Just like the one  You just described  For Jim Ryan  And then cut him off  What is that kid 
[01:50:30]  Going to do  Big duties  From Jersey  That means  You're fucking old  The movie made  70 million  This weekend  What movie  Which one  Star Wars  Made 70 million  Yeah not  The Longest Yard  Didn't make 70 million  Shut up  Jesus  Ass heads  God now I gotta  Look that up  Look it up  What's up Steve  No you're asking about the  I think Longest Yard 
[01:51:00]  Did make 70 million  This weekend  Stop it  No I'm serious  No way  Because Star Wars  Blew everything away  By making like 100  Or something like that  Because it's up to  Half a billion internationally  Oh boy do I look like  An idiot today  Today always  Here it is Anthony  Box office returns  For the weekend  You ready for this  Revenge of the Sith  Made another 71 million  Over the weekend  I got it bro  Madagascar  61 million  The Longest Yard  60 million  60 not 70  60  Guys it's 70 
[01:51:30]  And I knew Star Wars  Made 70  And it was in first place  Whoops  Well there you go  It's a huge hit  Are you kidding me  Did anyone see it though  Is it a good movie  Go to Rotten Tomatoes  Steve saw it  You saw The Longest Yard  Yeah  And what do you think  Well I don't really  Have a point of reference  You never saw the original  I think I might have  Caught a few minutes  Of it on like you know  PIX when they were  Airing it like on  Sunday afternoons  But I never  I don't really have  A point of reference  So with that said  It's cute  I mean I wouldn't  See it again  But I mean the  Burt Reynolds thing  Is totally unbelievable  He's feeble 
[01:52:00]  He's sitting there  Even been in the movie  His facelift looks horrible  He's not  He's got some massive work done  Seventy year old men  Don't suit up  And play full contact football  That's unbelievable  As hell  Oh is he like  Seventy  Sixty eight  Sixty eight years old  Alright  So I mean  But it's all  But he suits up  For a play or something  Yeah he suits up  For one play  It's full of  It's an Adam Sandler  Produced movie  And they stick  Some Sandlerisms  In there  And that's  That's a little forced  Like you know  Those awkward characters  Wait Sandler's barely  In the movie  What  No no no no  Like those Adam 
[01:52:30]  Those weird characters  I'm sorry  Sandler's in the movie  But they stick in  Those awkward appearances  By like Rob Schneider  At one point  Oh does he say  You can do it  Yeah  Well Rob Schneider  Has to be in every  Adam Sandler movie  For some reason  You can do it  Alright here it is Anthony  This is the only place  I go for movie reviews  Ah  It's Rotten Tomatoes  Rotten Tomatoes dot com  Is great  Because what they do  Is they take all the reviews  From all over the country  Yeah  And all the big papers  And then they throw them together  And give it a percentage  Nice  A fresh tomato is what  60% 
[01:53:00]  So 60% of the reviews  Have to be good  For this site  To call it a fresh tomato  Meaning it's a movie  Worth seeing  Uh huh  And then  And then they go from there  And basically  They're giving  The Longest Yard  A rotten reading  Rotten  32%  Positive reviews  That means 68%  Of all reviewers  Hate this movie  If only the ethnic  Reassigned Burt Reynolds  Had stayed naked  On that bare rug  Plagued with product placement  Sandler is trying to 
[01:53:30]  Outrun his  Clownish boy man past  But since everything  About yard  Is transparently fake  It loses him  Career yardage  The Longest Yarn  I like the  I like the football analogy  Yeah  They put in  The Longest Yarn  A terrible remake  Of a great  Dramedy  Sets a record  Of some sort  For meaningless  Celebrity  Cameos  When Adam Sandler  Isn't interesting enough  To hold your attention  In an Adam Sandler movie  Something is certainly  Amiss 
[01:54:00]  Easy  Formula stuff  Fine tuned  With sure fire  Gags  Just remember kids  As fun as it all seems  Fast food  Soda  Candy  Binge drinking  Reckless driving  Steroids  Dirty ball  And well yes  Adam Sandler movies  Are bad for you  Wow  They're killing this  If you like Adam Sandler  Goofy comedy  And football  I suggest seeing  The Waterboy instead  Watching this remake  Of the 1974 classic  Is like watching  A high school production  Of your favorite musical  Oof  Ow  Hollywood has once again 
[01:54:30]  Demonstrated  It's lack of originality  As if we need  Further proof  By serving up  Another lackluster remake  Of a sparkling original  It just goes on and on  A misguided  Miscast remake  Of the 1974  Robert Aldrich classic  You know what was really good  Adam Sandler movie  Spanglish  You're kidding  Of course I'm kidding  You scared the shit out of me  I almost wanted that  On demand  Because I was bored  What  I almost did  Because I needed a movie  To watch  I would pick any other movie  On except for that 
[01:55:00]  There are certain movies  I see advertisements  Come on  And I go  There is no way  I'm ever ever  Going to see that  I will never see that movie  And  I never see him  That's it  Alright it goes on and on  So Rotten Tomato  Just killing this movie  I did end up watching  Father of the Bride  Oh  Faggot  You saw Father of the Bride  I know  That was one of those movies  I said  You know I gotta  I gotta admit  I saw part of that  Just because HBO  Is showing that  Around the clock  Pretty much  Every time you go to HBO  It's Father of the Bride 
[01:55:30]  Or stupid  Sex of the City  That's all they have  These days  I was in the hotel  And  Slept with the TV on  Wake up  It's on  And  You're kinda like  Too lazy  And tired to even  Grab the remote  So I'm watching it  You know  Steve Martin  Mildly  Mildly entertaining  But what a  Sappy  Ugh  Like  Oh  God  Shut up  Ugh  Chick flick  Alright let's go to 
[01:56:00]  Ricky in Florida  Ricky what's up  Hey man what's going on  So you saw  The Longest Yard  It was the biggest  Piece of shit  I've ever seen  In my entire life  What was wrong with it  It got totally  Sammarized  Like there was  Like funny jokes  In there  And then it got  Really serious  For a couple moments  With Chris Rock  And then it got  Funny again  Hold on hold on  Can I interrupt you  For a second  Hugh  Hugh Direction  From Long Island  Yes I did say  The Longest Yarn  That's exactly  How the review  Read  You ass  Somebody's  Giving you crap  Yes I did say 
[01:56:30]  The Longest Yarn  Go to  RottenTomatoes.com  And see it for yourself  If I read it correctly  Alright go ahead  Ricky  Yeah the movie  It's like  It starts out  Pretty much with  Sammar just doing  Like all his  Funny jokes and shit  In the beginning  With like Courtney Cox  But as the movie  Gets going along  With the prison guards  And stuff  The only funny part  I thought about it  Was the wrestlers  That were in it  Like Steve Austin  And Kevin Nash  And Goldberg  Other than that  All the Sammar's jokes  And stuff  Were just like  Really cheesy  And like  You pretty much 
[01:57:00]  Watch the water bottle  And you get  Everything that you would have  How many more movies  Is he allowed to make  In Hollywood  Before people realize  That he's over  And I know  A big part of our audience  Are huge Adam Sandler fans  But I mean  He's had a ton of bombs now  Did you see that mess  With Drew Barrymore  Where she can't remember anything  She has a short term memory problem  Or long term memory problem  50 first dates  It was awful  Yeah that was really bad  And then you got Spanglish  Now you got the longest yard  Spanglish  And then there were  I believe there was  A couple more in there  That just were awful  He's uh 
[01:57:30]  You know what it is  He's getting too old  For those little cutesy roles  And he's trying  I think with that Spanglish thing  Trying to branch out  Into uh  You know  Regular acting  And it didn't work  You know  It's not working  So  But he's still getting  Huge amounts of money  Per movie  Right  Alright Ricky  So you hated it huh  Yeah  I pretty much hated it  Well you know what  I hope he never  Never does another remake  Ever again  Well there's a bunch  Of dummies out there  That thought  It was worth seeing 
[01:58:00]  60 million dollars  At the box office  Over the weekend  Jesus  And in fourth place  Right behind the longest yard  Monsters  Monster in Law  And what's sad  Is it'll be  It'll come to rental  In about three months  Well I mean  I guess I would take a peek  If it was on HBO  Or something  Monster in Law  It's worth  Monster in Law  Made 11.1 million  I don't want to see  Anything with any  Of these friggin  Actors or actresses  In it  Like Jane Fonda  I don't want to see  A movie  With Dustin Hoffman 
[01:58:30]  In it  Like the Falkers  With what's her face  There  Barbara Streisand  I don't want to see  These are movies  That ancient people  Go to and laugh  Because they don't  Know that it's not funny  That's what it is  Don't want to see it  Monster in Law  And then Kicking  J-Lo and Jane Fonda  Stop it  I will find the remote  If that's on  And I woke up  And it's on TV  And then Kicking and Screaming  Kicking and Screaming 
[01:59:00]  Made 6.6 million  Over the weekend  Which one's that?  Will Farrell  Which is pretty much  Another bomb for him  Yeah  Anchorman was a strange movie  It had it's moments  But a really weird  You know movie  And now he's got this  Kicking and Screaming  Have you seen the preview  For Bewitched  Bewitched?  Oh my god  Does that look awful  It doesn't even look awful  It's just  Like I could care less  I'll watch an episode  Of Bewitched  Love story  Is it like a love story?  Mmhmm  Well the problem  With that movie  Is he's like an actor 
[01:59:30]  Playing Darren  And they're trying to  What cast?  Samantha  Or they're trying to  Cast a new Darren  It's awful  Wait  Wait  So they're taking you  Out of the whole concept  That it was an actual  You know  Husband and wife  It's just the remake  But here's the spin  She actually is  Oh I get it  So she's going to be  Playing Samantha  Or something like that  And she's a real  It just looks awful  But Major Nilsson  Yeah exactly  And then I saw  But she  And then a movie like Crash 
[02:00:00]  I heard Crash was a pretty cool movie  That made  Like 6 million over the weekend  Alright well whatever  There you have it  Let's go to Guy in Oklahoma  Try sitting through  Punch Drunk Love  With Adam Sandler  And not wanting to  Stab your eyes out with knives  Worst movie ever  It's G-Man  And that is the absolute truth  I saw that one  And I was like  What?  What?  What was Punch Drunk Love about?  So that's  I don't know 
[02:00:30]  That was like the fourth movie  In a row that was a bomb for him  I honestly couldn't even tell you  What it was about  Let's go to Guy in Oklahoma  Guy turn down your XM  And start talking  Hey what's up ONA?  Hey man  Hey the only way  To make this movie any worse  Is to put Voss in there  Let people smell behind his ear  And put Norton in there  And let him run the ball at the last  So I guess you're trying to say  That it was a really bad movie  And a waste of your hard earned money  Oh man  You could follow the movie  Step by step 
[02:01:00]  It was ridiculous  Right okay  And it was a big joke  Watching Burt Reynolds  At the last  I mean this guy  Has no business  Being in movies anymore  He totally sucks  Alright thank you bro  He's in a lot of  What other movies  Is he going to pop up in now?  Dukes of Hazzard  Dukes of Hazzard  Playing Boss Hog  Which is  Why cast this guy in anything?  You can think of other people  To cast as Boss Hog  Dukes of Hazzard  The movie is going to be  Just another disaster  You think so?  Jessica Simpson is going to look great  She looked really hot in there  With her little short shorts  I don't know  She's going to look awesome 
[02:01:30]  But the movie is going to stink  The show stunk  Why should the movie be any different  But at least  You know  At least make the casting fun  Burt Reynolds  You can't even  Like he was good in  In Boogie Nights  Burt Reynolds  Yeah he had it  That was really good in Boogie Nights  Because he was playing like  A real sleaze  You know  Scumbag kind of guy  You know  There's a lot of people  Calling us out on this stuff  Going  Hey man  50 First Dates  Made a ton of money  That's great  But it was  It was an awful movie  Yeah it was 
[02:02:00]  If you can't  You know  Acknowledge that  You're crazy  There's a lot of dopes out there  A lot of sheep  That'll just go  Oh  I saw the commercials  For The Longest Yard  Let's go see  The Longest Yard  Yeah  When I saw the previews  I said  Skip  No way am I going to go  See that piece of crap  I don't care if Chris Rock's in it  I don't care if Adam Sandler's in it  You know  I don't care if the wrestlers are in it  Am I being too bitter today?  Bob in North Carolina  Why?  Dan  You guys are great man  Hey what's up?  I just wanted to let you know 
[02:02:30]  I was like Anthony  And I had nothing to watch yesterday  And I did rent Spanglish  With my wife  And that movie  It was good  It didn't feel like an Adam Sandler movie  Thankfully  Did you see Spanglish?  No  The Girl in it is hot  I would never ever sit through that  I'm just making sure  I'm just making sure  The Girl in it is super hot  Yeah a lot of people are saying  That The Girl in it is just really hot  Yeah but that's what the internet's for  Thanks guys  Yeah that's what Mr. Skin's all about  So you don't have to sit through the actual movie  To see the piece of ass 
[02:03:00]  Has review on Monster in Law  John on Long Island  Go ahead John  Hey good morning guys  Hey  What's up  Funny face  No Jimmy's moving  He's going to call into the program in a few minutes here  Go ahead John  I'm looking for him  You know I was going to want to catch hell for this  To see episode 3  I had to take my wife to see Monster in Law  I've never wanted to choke myself  Just so I would pass out during the movie  That bad?  Yeah  Predictable 
[02:03:30]  Just  Jane Fonda was way over the top  And she looks like this  See  That's what all those movies are about  They're all predictable  The jokes are such  Formula  You know the punchline kind of joke  And then you get like  Jane Fonda doing her  Older person acting  Like from years ago  Where it was good acting  Like in the 60's  But now it just comes across  As over the top  It's horrible to watch  Dan says I'm bitter  Hey 
[02:04:00]  Hey Dan  Hey what's going on  Hi Dan  It's me  What movie do you like recently  You haven't said a good thing about anything  I liked  I liked episode 3  In episode 3  You were like  It was okay  No  No no  I liked it  I thought they needed more  Darth Vader  Well  You know  I mean they  You know they wrap up everything nice  The last five minutes  In the movie  It would have been nice  If they did the transition  A little  You know  A little earlier in the film  So you got a little more Darth  I liked Saw 
[02:04:30]  But I  Morgan Freeman  If Morgan Freeman wasn't in it  I think it would have been a better movie  Was he the one that was in it  Morgan Freeman was in Saw  Or the other black guy  Danny Glover  Danny Glover  The other guy that can't get a cab  Yeah  I thought Saw was  A cool movie  I'm sorry  What Dan  I'm just trying to make sure  The divorce hasn't made Anthony  Better  Because it seems like recently  Anthony got divorced  Like I think three or four years ago now  Five years ago  Five years ago  You know what though 
[02:05:00]  I'm with Anthony  I haven't  Star Wars was great  I really enjoyed that movie  But besides that  I haven't seen a good movie  In a long time  I'm really trying to think  I walk by my movie theater  All the time  I want to go see a flick  So bad  We had a bunch of days off in a row  And I was kind of bored  I'm like  Alright I'm going to go  There's nothing to watch  I want to go see that  Layer Cake  Or whatever  That looks pretty good  And it's getting great reviews  Even though Francine  Didn't like the movie  Francine didn't like Layer Cake  And Crash is supposedly  Is a pretty good movie 
[02:05:30]  But besides that  I don't want to go see  The Longest Yard  Or any of this other crap  That's out  Monster Long  Kicking and Screaming  Please  I like movies that  Aren't the big movies  That come out  Because those are  Usually the ones  That appeal to the mass audience  Of just jackasses  And they're so  Like  The mass holes  Mass holes  And I'm sorry  I don't find them funny  I don't find them interesting  I like movies like  You go around the video store  And pick up something like  Boondock Saints  You see that one 
[02:06:00]  It's a good  Friggin movie right there  Things like that  Right  The Cooler  That was a fun little flick  That was  A few months back  Or probably about  A half a year now  Kevin from Brooklyn  Yeah  I really can't trust you  As a movie critic  Because I wasted  Two hours of my life  This weekend  Watching the swimming pool  Alright listen to me  If you  It says on the screen  Wasted two hours  Watching swimming pool  You have to be a fag  No I'm not a fag  Dude trust me  There was one scene  Wait wait wait  Kevin Kevin Kevin  Kevin  Because obviously  You heard Anthony 
[02:06:30]  And I talking about  Swimming pool  What did we say  About the movie  Swimming pool  I'm going to challenge you now  That it was hot  That you could jack to it  Yeah  Uh huh  Dude she was giving head  To one guy for two seconds  That's all I saw  Dude stop  Holy crap  She's naked  Looking through a lot of the movie  That sex scene  She gets up and straddles the guy  She has at least  At least four or five nude scenes  That are unbelievable  Great tit shots  Wait wait wait  Kevin I can barely tell you  What the movie was about  I told Anthony about this film  I'm like Anthony  You gotta see Swimming Pool 
[02:07:00]  Because this girl  She's like 19 in it  She's got a perfect body  And she's just loose  With her sexuality  Right  She doesn't get banged  With this thing  You said it was hotter  Than that movie  With Selma Blair  Where she was saying  Fuck me harder nigga  Remember that one  Yeah  Well that scene was pretty hot  But I'm  The girl in Swimming Pool  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know  It was amazing  I don't know if the movie was good  The movie was too weird  And it's too much  Of that old bag in it  And it didn't help  That the old bag got naked  Near the end of the movie  I'll give you that much  And they're like 
[02:07:30]  Well she looks  She has the body  Of a 28 year old  No she doesn't  We didn't say  It was a good movie  We said it's hot  Alright  Alright  That's too bad  You must be a faggot  You must be a faggot  Look at the picture  Stop it  How do you not look  At that picture  And go oh my god  Oh my god  I'm MrSkin.com right now  Looking at this  And just stop it  Look at the cans on her  She has a perfect body  That guy was a homo  That just called  He had to be  You're a homo  You're a mo 
[02:08:00]  You don't like hot  19 year olds naked  You're a faggot  Look at this  Look at this picture  Stop it  I know this is radio  But god damn  And these are pictures  Not quick flash scenes  In the movie  These are scenes  Remember when I called you  And turned you on  To Swimming Pool  I'm like dude  I've seen a flick  You gotta see  Well first you did that  And then I found it  On cable  So I call up Opie  Yeah  And I was like  Dude Swimming Pool's on  Should I watch it  Oh no you gotta watch it  And then I'm like  Call me back 
[02:08:30]  When she's naked  For the first time  Look at that  Stop  Yeah this girl  Is just ridiculous  Stop  Ridiculous  Guy's out of his mind  Let's go to Jeff  Oh we lost Jeff  Alright  Under a movie  Things to do in Denver  What is it  Oh yeah  I remember that one  What was that one about again  Things to do in Denver  When you're dead  Tom in West Virginia  Yeah I mean  Things to do in Denver  When you're dead  It's a great movie  That a lot of these idiots  Don't go out  Or never saw  Or never rent  And it's excellent  Yeah that was a good one  What was that movie about  Andy Garcia was in it 
[02:09:00]  Treat Williams  It was kind of  Spoof on a  Mafia guy  Pulling a caper  Yeah it was pretty good  Alright I'm going to  Search that one out  Because I'm so sick  Of the crap they're  Throwing in these theaters  Lately  Hotel Rwanda  Was pretty good  I thought  I actually thought  They kind of  Tamed down the violence  A little bit  I thought it could have  Been a little more graphic  As far as the  Machete hackings  And stuff went  But that was  A pretty good movie  Don Cheadle's  A really good actor  Alright  So I like that  And that's a recent movie 
[02:09:30]  I like Downfall  Downfall  The  The Hitler Bunker movie  Oh that's right  You talked about that  Recently  That one I liked  I liked that very much  How about  Madagascar  Madagascar  It looks like a funny  Animated movie  I like the animated movies  Let's go to Mike in New York  Mike what's up  Hey what's up fellas  Hey  Hey the worst movie  Of all time  Is fucking  House of Wax  You saw that  With Paris Hilton  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah we just 
[02:10:00]  Paris Hilton's like  Yeah whatever  She got  She got engaged  Over the weekend  And I say  Who cares  What a horrible  Fucking actor  She is  Paris Hilton  Does not deserve  To be in any movie  We knew that  But it's  House of Wax  Ever  It's not like  She's in Shakespeare  Right  No it was  Fucking horrible  With her and the  That other hot chick  Eliza  No not Elijah  Dooshku  Elizabeth  Dooshku  Okay well  I don't know her name  Well that's obvious  House of Wax  Don't go see it  It was fucking 
[02:10:30]  A waste of five dollars  Alright thank you  Five bucks  Where's he left  Let's go to Carl  In Jersey  Five dollars  To see a movie  No doubt  Carl what's up  Yo what's up guys  Hey  I just wanted to make the point  That you know  There's always crappy movies out  You know even in the days of like  When Casablanca was out  You know like  There's always some  Shitty tap dance movie out  Or something  Which is like  Carl I agree with you  But it just seems lately  And I'm saying within the last  I don't give it like  The last couple of years  It seems like there's nothing  But crap out 
[02:11:00]  I always would be able  To go to a  You know a multiplex  And find something  That wasn't the  The mass release type movie  Something that got good reviews  That you just know  A lot of people aren't going to see  And I just can't find  Those movies anymore  It's almost like  Hollywood has given up  It's like here's the formula  If we advertise a movie a lot  People will come and see it  It doesn't even really matter  You know if the movie's that great  If the quality's up there  You just throw a few stars at you  You know a couple  Cute scenes that look good  In a preview 
[02:11:30]  And people are going to go  Run to the theaters and see it  Yeah  Alright love you guys  Alright  Bye  Now people are saying  What about Willy Wonka  With Johnny Depp  Now that looks like  It has potential right  Yeah  It's not on the same story  Oh it isn't?  No  It's not like a remake  No  Johnny Depp's really good too  Like that guy could play anything  Yeah  Pretty versatile  Alright  Why don't we  We have Bob Kelly finally  Bobby  Yo  We're going to talk to you next  Okay  Could you hold

[02:12:30]  Like uh  Yeah they've been  They've been  My own reference  It was pretty funny  Well they've been doing that  For a while now  With the animated movies  They make it so  You know  They know the parents  Have to drag their  Their little brats  To the movie theater  So they're like  Well might as well  Entertain the parents as well  Yeah and the  I think that guy  Didn't see the unrated version  Of Swimming Pool  He probably saw like  The candy coat on  Because the unrated version  Was kicked ass  What's different in the unrated version  Because I don't know  If I saw that version  Well you get it on DVD  And it's totally uncut  I don't know  I didn't see the regular  Because they offer a regular 
[02:13:00]  And an unrated version  You know  And the unrated versions  Are usually hotter  Right  But the uh  But there was definitely like  Five or six scenes in there  Which she was just going crazy  Yeah Swimming Pool  I actually only saw one  It is just amazing  It just plays right into  Your fantasy world  I'm telling you  Alright  Alright  And  Love to meet the Fockers  Rich  Rich  Yeah  Hey  Hey  How's it going  Hey  Hey  I'm already  After he was ripping  On Meet the Fockers  All y'all feel like  I thought that shit 
[02:13:30]  Was hilarious  See I loved  Meet the Parents  And I still haven't seen  Meet the Fockers  Oh you gotta see  I mean  Especially since  They all tied all  Into the first movie  I mean  I was rolling  The whole time  I was watching  I thought that was  You know  One of the funniest movies  I've seen  Because I like  Meet the Parents also  So it  You know  They all just kept  The thing  I loved  Meet the Parents  I've seen that movie  Probably a dozen times  At this point  Alright  I'm gonna watch  Meet the Fockers  This week  And I'll give you  And I'll let you know  Later on this week  What I thought of it  Right on 
[02:14:00]  Right on  Alright  Huh  Well that's a different movie  That she was in  The chick from Swimming Pool  She's now riding some guy  In another movie  Wow  This is all on  Mr. Skin  Some effing going on  Look at those cones  They're just cones  Flapping up and down  Just perfect cones  Cones  Alright  I gotta take a leak  We got Bob Kelly next  We got Pat from Menachie  He's gonna do the news  And talk about his

[02:15:00]  So is the O&A virus  I'd like some more free time  To relate to the listeners  Because I have no time  In my Saturn  To relate to them at all  Oh I'm punching around town  Trying to find whores  In a family sedan  Fucking loser  Do you lease or did you buy  I bought  It paid off  First time I ever owned a car  It's all paid off  Yeah yeah  Three years  And what are you gonna  Are you gonna keep it  Or are you gonna upgrade it  I have like 30,000 on it dude  But it's having some problems  It's running a little bit sluggish  And it's kind of  I brought it into the same  Saturn dealership  Like 30 times 
[02:15:30]  And I'm still having  Like these weird little problems  It's like just make it run better  My fucking engine light  Will stop coming on  It's running sluggish  Because it's a Saturn  It's a three year old Saturn  Who are you kidding  Well my other Saturn  I've had this one  I got 160,000 out of my other one  You're trying  Really  Dude I've never  This one has only not started one time  I've had great success with these cars  That's why I buy it  Only not started one time  That's one time too many  No but it was a  But this is why I like Saturn  It was a battery  It was like some kind of  What'd you do  Did you hit your OnStar  And go  My car won't start  And they send somebody  And fix it  Yeah yeah yeah  But my OnStar 
[02:16:00]  Is even better than yours  Because it comes in my pocket  And Sprint does it  So I just  I pick it up  No actually it's twice  It didn't start  Once it actually just broke down  Yeah  I've really had enough  Of this fucking Saturn  Three years  And you already have it  Breaking down on you  Yeah  This one's not as good  As the other ones man  I've had some good luck  I don't know though dude  You beat the crap  Out of your cars  Not really dude  I got less than  30,000 on it  In three years  I used to do 30,000  A year when I was  Living in Jersey  Yeah  90,000 by this point  Is what I would have on it  And it was still going good  It's tough city miles though  Yeah that's true 
[02:16:30]  How many brake jobs  Have you had?  I think only one  30 miles driving in the city  Yeah  30,000 miles  Don't forget  Sometimes I'll go out  Do gigs or whatever  But most of us  Is your door all scratched up  From Tranny's fake nails  Hitting the side of it  Yeah like  Well like  Two feet down  From the big mules  Banging into the side  Right  You're denting your door  Yeah  You got a mule dent  Hi daddy  Sometimes I only crack the window  So I get  This is happening  I get lipstick prints  On the very top of my window  Which I won't open it  Because they'll put  They're heaving hands in  What could I do for you daddy 
[02:17:00]  That big lips  Dance  What are you doing daddy  Oh  Lipstick marks on your window  Yeah because  You open the window like an inch  Just so they can chat into it  Like an old lady's coffee cup  Opie and Anthony  The virus is spreading  All right 
[02:17:30]  Lots still to do today  Are we trying to get  Jim Norton on the phone  Jim Norton is moving  We got Bob Kelly on the phone  We have Pat from Minaki  Getting his news together  And he's got his  Hot dog eating contest trophy  He does  He brought that in  We'll get some pictures of that  And get it up on the websites  I guess we'll start with Bob Kelly then  I don't know where Jimmy is 
[02:18:00]  Robert  Yo  How's the knee first of all  It's still fucked up  But I can walk around now  But I was talking to Jimmy this weekend  You're back on stage  And doing your thing  But you still haven't fixed it  Nah I can't fix it yet  Because my whole knee  Hang on  Hang on  Okay go ahead  Sounds like you might have a problem there  Came out like a big clump  Oh  Hold on  I had my cock hole 
[02:18:30]  I  I  Yeah man  It's all  It's better now  I just  My leg  All my muscle  And my quadricep  Bob can I interrupt you  Yes sir  You sat around all morning thinking  This would be really clever  If I just took a leak  Live on the air  Didn't you  I'm going to piss on the radio  No  You had me on hold  I didn't know when you were coming back  And  I have to piss and shit  At the same time  Every morning  Are you  Are you what  You're sitting down  As soon as I have a cigarette  As soon as I take a first  Sip of coffee 
[02:19:00]  I either have to piss or shit  Every single morning  Like clockwork  My fucking bowels  And my pee hole  My urinary track work  Are you taking a dump right now  No I don't have to take a dump yet  But I've been on the  South Beach diet  So that might not happen  The South Beach diet  What is the South Beach diet  Which one is that  I always see that book  In the bookstore  It's uh  Just  It's all that  No carb shit  I haven't had a carb  In like two weeks  And I want to stab  Somebody's eye out  With a fucking potato  Is it working for you 
[02:19:30]  Uh  Well I don't feel as bloated  Oh  Well see  The problem with all these diets  I mean  As soon as you lose the weight  You just go back to eating  Like a slob  You got to change your lifestyle  That's what people don't understand  They go  Ah I'll do the South Beach diet  It's all the rage  And then they lose their 30 pounds  And they're like  Ah  Lost the weight  It'll never come back  Might as well go back to cheeseburgers  And french fries  And  And what have you  It's all genetics  Huh  It's all genetics  Nah  So it's  It has something to do with willpower  Just changing the way you eat  That's all  I just want a body like you Opie 
[02:20:00]  That's all  Slowly but surely  You just find foods you enjoy  That aren't fatty  That's it  That's it  Uh yeah  Well that's it  Slowly but surely  You go to therapy  And you get out of your depression  And you  Find out who molested you  When you were a kid  And you stop wanting to  Shovel cake down your throat  To make the hole in your stomach  Go away  You really are  You're still in therapy  What do you mean ugh  We all had problems growing up  Get over it  Really  That's what I say  I'm going to write a  Get over it  I'm going to write a book called  Get over it  By Dr. Opie 
[02:20:30]  How many cocks did you suck  Get over it  Alright I'm done  You're right  That's what the name of my new book  Is going to be called  Get over it  It's going to be one page  And it's going to cost you $14.95  Because I'm a good guy  I'm not going to take too much money from you  Get me a copy god damn it  I'll get over it  I just don't get that therapy thing  I just don't  My mom's been in and out of therapy  Her whole life  And I don't really see  Anything different  Get over it  Suck it up  My new book 
[02:21:00]  Suck it up  They follow up to get over it  Walk it off dick  In my old relationship  The last ditch effort was  Why don't we go to couple counseling  Bye bye  So long  Adios  Adios amigos  So long  Yeah I would never do that  When you have to go to couple counseling  It's over Johnny  You're never getting back  To where you were  You're going to sit there  With some lady  That doesn't even know you  And in an hour  She's going to give you advice 
[02:21:30]  Because of what you choose  To tell her  Fuck that  You have to make rules  For your arguments  That way  You're not offending each other  And  Like when you're in an argument  You're thinking rationally  And not just yelling obscenities  And trying to drudge out  Something somebody did to you  Hey I'm just saying  You know  I'm sure I'll get the email later  And the phone calls  Look  Couple counseling  Helped us  I'm fine  Then congratulations  My whole theory  Is when you have to  Bring a therapist  Into your 
[02:22:00]  Into your relationship  The relationship is over  Completely over  Why  Why did I turn  Your therapist  About therapy  What  Why did I turn  Into your therapist  Because I forgot  That you're always  Doing the therapy thing  I don't get the therapy thing  I gotta tell you  I don't get it  You pay some lady  Because it's mostly ladies  Right  Yeah  And you pay them  You pay them  To sit there  And listen to your  Bullshit crap  For an hour  Right  And then they're like  They're so concerned  But as soon as the hour's up  They're not concerned anymore  Because they got another  Schlepp in the waiting room 
[02:22:30]  Waiting with their problems  I'll tell you why  It's good for a guy like me  Because most people  I would agree with  You probably don't need therapy  Because you have good friends  Hold on a minute  Someone's saying  That I'm ripping off  Dennis Leary  And I'll give this guy  The time of day  I have no idea  I'm ripping off Dennis Leary  Tim go ahead  Hey how's it going  I just wanted to say  That that whole  Knock it off  With whatever you're saying  I punch it out  What a fucking moron  No if he had something  That's cool  I swear to you  He's saying 
[02:23:00]  Stop hacking off Dennis Leary  Dennis Leary does a bit  On therapists or something  Really  You can say that  About any comedian  You ask  In a conversation  Alright well  Someone else is saying  And I swear to you guys  I have no idea  A bunch of people  Holy crap  Muttbone from over here  Ope's book  Get Over  It sounds a lot like  Dennis Leary's book  Shut the fuck up  Next  You're ripping him off  Hoo hoo  And then Sean from Connecticut  Careful Ope  You're stealing an old  Dennis Leary bitch  Shut the fuck up  By Dr. Dennis Leary  What album was that off 
[02:23:30]  Cause after the  You're ripping him off  Cause after the first CD  Where he ripped off  All of Bill Hicks' material  I haven't really  Bought a Dennis Leary CD  That old argument  I swear to God  I had no idea  That I was doing  Dennis Leary material  It just seems very  Very logical  That  You know  I think a lot of people  Would agree  With this therapist  Crap  And it is true  We all had problems  Growing up  Yeah but Ope  What I'm trying to say  To you is  I have no friends  None of my friends  Jim, Patrice  Keith Robinson 
[02:24:00]  If I call any one of them  Up to say  Hey dude  I'm having a hard time  They hang up  On my face  Right  Those are the worst  Collection of friends  They're the worst  So I'm paying for a friend  Once a week Ope  Just to listen to me  That's all  I'm paying for it  But do you realize  That person doesn't really care  I know he doesn't care  He wants my money  And they're only giving you  Advice  Based on what you decide  To tell them  So I think if you do  Go to a therapist  You have to be  Completely honest  I am  And how many  Maybe you are the guy 
[02:24:30]  Bob  Maybe you're the guy  But I think everyone  That goes to a therapist  They're holding back stuff  That is going to fuck up  The advice that's coming back at you  I don't like the little sarcasm  You had when you said  Maybe you're the guy  I caught that little  Fucking sarcasm  Maybe you're the guy  In other words  He meant  You're not the guy  I don't know  Hold on  Hold on  I will defend you Bob  Because you've probably  I'm going to give you the title  I'm going to give you a title right now  I think you have been  The most honest person  We've ever had on this show  Even more than Jim Norton 
[02:25:00]  This guy has said stuff  Where I know  When I'm going home  And stuff  I'm like  I cannot believe  He's openly talking about  This stuff on the radio  So although you heard sarcasm  I'm telling you  Maybe you are the guy  Because you are  Pretty damn open  About what has happened  To you in the past  I am very open  And you know what  Actually  I actually have gone to the show  And been  And done therapy  All right  Hold on  Hold on  It was off  Dennis Leary's  Lock and Load album  I did not listen  To that piece of crap 
[02:25:30]  I'm sorry  I heard that  It was an awful album  And I never listened  To the Dennis Leary  Lock and Load album  Okay  Are you talking about  My CD or his  Huh  I haven't listened  To yours yet either  Even though you gave it to me  About six months ago  I'm sorry  Thanks a lot  Appreciate it  All right  Continue Bob  Listen man  I just pay for a friend  If you want to be my friend  I'd call you  Oh he just paid  No we really tried  To be friends  And we both knew  It just wasn't working  Now wait a minute  Oh  We were at a Starbucks  And he  He went down the friend road 
[02:26:00]  And I'm like  You know  I don't know Bob  I got all my friends  I don't know  I don't know  I don't know if I have room  For another friend  I'm pretty much done  Bob you remember  That day too  I was like  Why don't we exchange numbers  And I'm like  You can get a hold of me  Through Jim  Yeah  He had a whole conversation  In his own head though  He didn't even involve me  I'm done with friends  And then out of nowhere  We're just sitting in there  In silence  And he goes  Nah we can't be friends  I'm like  What the fuck  Are you talking about  Oh my god  I forgot 
[02:26:30]  This happened  When we were on hiatus  And I was hanging out  With Norton and Bob  And I like Bob  I think he's cool  And stuff  And we're sitting at Starbucks  And we went from  Like you know  That uncomfortable  Don't know each other  That he's trying to like  You know  Squeeze in some personal stuff  That you do  When you're trying  To make friends  And I'm thinking to myself  Nah this is  This just ain't gonna work  I'm just gonna cut my losses  But Bob  Could you  And so I  Friend  So I openly  Just told him in Starbucks  You know Bob  I'm just not feeling  The friend thing  But I go  What are you  I'm sitting there  I'm eating my  French french fries 
[02:27:00]  I go  What the fuck  Are you talking about  He goes  Nah we're just  I don't think  We can be friends  I don't think  It's gonna work  I'm like  This guy  In my head  I'm going  This guy  Is fucking out of his mind  Like right away  You just get that  Out of the way  Yeah I just said  One time in my life  And this is it  And he's already decided  We can't be friends  He's already had  The whole fucking thing  You need therapy  Well I know I do  But I don't believe in it  I just told you that  I just told you  My whole thing  Well when Bob  Rattles off his friends  Jim Norton  And Patrice  Yeah  It's 
[02:27:30]  He needs friends  He needs real friends  Not these  These uh  Clowns  Yeah  At least I'm not out there  Trying to make  Girls my friend  Why  Nothing  Nice talking to you  Jim Norton  Nothing  Yeah I'll listen to you  If you suck my asshole  Um  You're right Opie  We can't be friends  Yeah I don't know  I don't even  You're too honest  The last friend I made  I don't have  I was through  Making friends  Years ago  I have co-workers 
[02:28:00]  I have acquaintances  That you know  I'll talk to things  About like  Gaming  Or  Or  The news  Things like that  But as far as  Real friends  That I would  Call up and say  Hey you know  What are you doing  Let's hang out  Or  You know  I can't remember  The last friend I made  It's probably  Somewhere back in the 90's  I would like to make  A new friend  Would you  Yeah  A lot goes into that  It's a big responsibility  It sure is  And if it  If something  If you realize 
[02:28:30]  You don't want to be friends  After you pass  The friend point  Now you're really fucked  But Opie would never  Get there  Because he has that  Conversation in his head  The first time  He puts it  I like that Opie  That gets it out of the way  It gets it out of the way  You have to hit me fast man  You gotta get  You gotta get my interest  Immediately  No delusion  I didn't know  I didn't know  There was an audition  Of course it is  I was sitting there  And I wasn't feeling  What you were saying  I'm like  You know what  I don't feel like  I don't feel like  You know  Putting in the effort 
[02:29:00]  To be your friend  You brought up  You're not worth  My efforts  Anthony  He brought up  The conversation  Yeah  This like  Real  We were just fucking around  Joking  Norton leaves  Then he throws some  Serious shit in my face  To see how I'd respond  And of course  It was uncomfortable  It was like  You know  My dad talking to me  About sex  And I don't even know Opie  And then he's like  You know what  We can't be friends  I didn't feel like  Putting in the effort  That's all  I kind of like that approach  I just wanted to 
[02:29:30]  Throw that on the table  Because I didn't want  The awkward  Like let's exchange  Numbers  You know  I don't know  I actually agree with you  You were right on the money  You shouldn't be my friend  I'm a lousy human being  The last friend I made  Was Jim Norton  Because you were just saying  You know  The last friend  And that's five years ago  I haven't made a new friend  In five, six years now  But I don't even go out  Like with Jimmy  I don't call Jim  And go  Hey Jim  What are you doing  Let's go out  I consider him a friend  In that  You know  We have things in common

[02:40:30]  I still consider him a friend  Fareed  Nah  You were becoming friends  You took a Learjet with him to Arizona  I blew off the Learjet  Because I decided to be a nomad  There's this whole friendship  Bob  Our agent Bob Eatman  You're friends with Bob  I stayed at his house a few times  You stayed at his house  I make friends  You tipped his maid  I make  I do tip his maid  Because Bob's so cheap  He doesn't tip his own maid  He asked her for a receipt  Yeah  Pretty much  She works like an extra like five or six hours 
[02:41:00]  And he's like  Oh god  Here's ten bucks  I'm mortified when I stay there  What a cheapo  So she cleans out my dirty  She does my laundry  And I get  And Bob's like  Don't tip her  And I leave money on the dresser for her  Like five, ten bucks a day  Oh my god  To do my laundry  That's just disgusting  I'm out there  I could not stay with people  And as far as Fareed  I had a ride back to New York from Phoenix  Because I went out there to talk at a stupid radio conference  Yeah  For uh  What stock did we on? 
[02:41:30]  Citadel  Oh yeah, Citadel  Shitadel I call it  And uh  And uh  I had a ride back on his Learjet  And I blew it off  Because I wanted to just  You know  Just roam around  The country  Really  Looking for friends  Searching for friends  See this is  This is the other side of me being an asshole  The reality is I have no friends  No  Like I had two years off  And I spent most of that time  Wandering around America  Alone  By myself  Like Kane from Kung Fu  You would think I could have called up somebody and said 
[02:42:00]  Hey  Let's go  Nothing  Let's go have some fun  And they'd say sorry  Not only am I not your friend  But I work for a living  Right  But Elo is trying to be friends  And he says I love you buddy  And things like that  Don't do it  He uses the word love  Maybe he should learn Kung Fu or something  Kung Fu  That's not a bad idea  Learn Kung Fu  Become like a master  And then just walk around roaming  Wander the earth  Get in adventures  Yeah  Get a stick  Blind yourself  Alright let's uh  Let's do a quick thing with the phones here  Go ahead Dane  Real fast  Hey hi Opie 
[02:42:30]  Hi Anthony  Fuck you Bob Kelly  I got one  I got a boatload of friends for Opie  Yeah  I got a bunch of pregnant girls over here in Jersey  With their thick areola nipples  And that dark line running up their belly for you  How about that  Oh god  You want that  You want that  With the milk  With that sweet sugary milk running out  See Bob  That's how we could have connected  If we were at a Starbucks  And all of a sudden you pointed out a pregnant woman  And said wow  That's hot 
[02:43:00]  And I would have said  You know Bob  I think that's hot too  Wow  Then we would have had a little something in common  And we could have went from there  I didn't know there was friggin a script  To friggin become your friend  Maybe next time you should fax it over to me  And I'll rehearse  Alright Mike  Mike from Long Island  Brings up a good point about Opie and friendship  How about Barry Williams Opie  You were seeking the friendship  Oh my god  Of Barry Williams  Anthony had to remind me that he was married  Because  Did we tell this story on the air  Yeah 
[02:43:30]  I remember where I was too  I actually called Anthony  For advice  I was out in LA  I was actually  Doing some inline skating  Around Santa Monica Pier  It's just amazing  You can you know  Skate on the beach  Or whatever  A bike path  And my phone rings  Because you know  Barry Williams  Greg Brady  He was on our show a lot  And he said  You know  Next time you're out to LA  Give me a call  We'll hang  And we hear this  From a lot of our  Quote celebrity  Friends slash guests  I don't consider them friends  Right  And they always blow us off 
[02:44:00]  But I called up  Like yeah  What the hell  You know  And once again  I'm by myself  Out in LA  Trying to kill time  And Barry actually says this  He goes  Dude I live at the top  Of Beverly Hills  Or somewhere  Bel Air or something  At the top of one  Of the mountains  He goes  Why don't you come over  Around 6  6.30  He actually said this  I'm going to throw myself  Under the bus  And then I will save myself  With my pal Anthony  He goes  Come up around 6 
[02:44:30]  6.30  We'll smoke some cigars  We'll have a couple  Apple martinis  Apple martinis  And we'll watch  The sunset  Watch the sunset  And then we'll have  A barbecue  And I'm like  That's exactly  What it was like  I was just like  Stupefied  I'm like  Because that sounds like  The gayest thing  Two guys  I think Barry wants  To suck my dick  Oh  Apple martinis  Left on your bag 
[02:45:00]  But you have to  Because it's Greg Brady  I mean come on  So then  I'm going through it  In my head  I'm like  If I go up there  And all of a sudden  He makes a move on me  I obviously got to tell him  Hey look  Barry  Hey  Hey  And all of a sudden  That sad  Brady Bunch music  Has to play  Because I'm rejecting  Greg Brady  You could have  Took your rollerblades  Up there  And rollerblade home  Hold on  Norton's on the line  And then we'll get back  To the Greg Brady thing  Hey Jimmy  Hey what's up boys 
[02:45:30]  How's the move going  It's cool man  It kind of reminds me  Watching your stuff  Be taken  You ever see like  As soon as  Saddam Hussein fell  The way Baghdad looked  The way they were  Running into stores  That's the way my shit  Is being lugged out  Of this apartment  Really  They treat other people's stuff  The way I would treat  Other people's stuff  Just like shit  Dude  We've talked about this  On the air  The last time I bought a TV  Now they're nice and flat  And stuff  My TV  I'm not kidding you  Weighed about 500 pounds  It's one of the last  Picture tube TVs 
[02:46:00]  You get 45 inch  Massive cool  And these gorillas  Actually rolled the TV  Into my apartment  They didn't care  They couldn't lift it  Because it's so heavy  So they rolled it  End over end over end  And these guys  Looked like they just  Got out of prison  I was scared  I didn't say shit  I was just hoping it worked  And I even tipped them  Of course  They bashed my walls  And everything  They rolled it in  Like a boulder  Well I  The guy made sure  Beforehand  He made sure  I was going to tip  Which I certainly am  And it's just  I'm glad I did as much  Stuff as I did 
[02:46:30]  Beforehand  Because I'm talking  A lot of people  Echoing here  I'm glad I did so much  Shit beforehand  Because it's just  Amazing to watch  All your stuff  Just get thrown  Into large boxes  White comforter  With black dirty  Candle stuff  Thrown on them  It's awful  Oh yeah  They have like  Five or six moves  Today  I mean your move  Is one of many  They have to get  It done immediately  Jimmy they're boxing  Things up too  Yeah just like  Most of my stuff  Is done  But there's some  Loose stuff  They just take  These giant boxes  Like for your comforter  Your candle hold  Anything you have  That little 
[02:47:00]  Leg thing I have  Under my toilet  Is now on top  Of my comforter  You know everything  Yeah they just  Throw it in a box  And move it out  Yeah yeah  It's brutal  Hey Jimmy  I'm going to bring up  A memory  We got Bob Kelly  On the line  We're going to  Eventually play his audio  Hi Jimmy  Hi Bobby  Do you remember the time  When we were off the air  And we all hung out  At Starbucks  Near your old place  There that you're  Moving out of  Me you and Kelly  And I turned to him  And told him  He couldn't be my friend  It was a cosmic diner  Oh was it the diner 
[02:47:30]  It was a diner  Jimmy went to take a pee  And then me and you  Were talking  And me and we were talking  And you brought up  Some serious relationship issue  Well Opie was almost  Like pulling you in  I was trying  I was trying you out  And I'm like  Ah forget it  He can't relate  He ain't going to work  And then again  I get you know  It's like some  Uncomfortable thing  Where I don't know dude  You know  I guess you just  You know try  You know one day at a time  I don't know  And then he was like  You know what  We can't be friends  That was his  That was his like line 
[02:48:00]  To see if you could  Audition  To be his friend  And you just  Flunked the audition  I really did  I got nervous  I was holding my script  In my hand  Looking at the lines  Do you remember that Jimmy  Where I just openly  Told him you know  It's just not going to work  And he  I remember some  Awkward exchange  Between you two  Which I had to sit  In the middle of a court  Yeah I told Anthony  That you were the last  Friend I ever made Jimmy  Five six years ago  I haven't made a friend since  And because you're friends  With Bob Kelly  I think we all had a feeling  That maybe Bob will join  This little crew of ours  Our separate little crew 
[02:48:30]  And I just told Bob  Eh you know  It's just not happening  Yeah I do remember that  And it was  You know  It was kind of  Heartbreaking for everyone  Involved  Because I didn't realize  I have to choose sides  And you know  I love you Bob  But until you get a radio show  Go fuck yourself  Well we've talked about that  If this show goes away again  None of us will keep in touch  I mean who are we kidding  I don't know  We hung out  We kept in touch  I mean  And Anthony  I called a few times  And I'm sure he heard my messages  So I mean  Yeah 
[02:49:00]  I don't have friends  I don't have friends either  I have guys I work with  That I'm you know  Some of them I'm closer with  Than others  And that's it  I don't have friends  Don't need them  Alright  We're a bunch of friendless asses  That's it  Look at what we've grown into  I used to have friends  When I was younger  I'd go out with them  Call up and go  Hey let's go down to the bar  Let's go to the Artful Dodger  Down there in Huntington  I was going to say  Build tree forts together  Yeah  Sleep in the tree fort 
[02:49:30]  And you can try to suck my dick  And I'll be asleep  You know  Fun nights out  Jeep jeep jeep jeep jeep  Let me roll this up for you  Okay  Well I'm in my bedroom now  They're taking my bed out  Uh oh  Or they're undoing the bed  Are they in  Are they in the outbreak suits  They should be  Is that the stuff right there  Oh my god  Of course  The best is when you move  And you see the stuff  That is under your bed  Yeah 
[02:50:00]  Yeah  Oh my god  The stuff I found  Under my bed  The last time I moved  They're finding fake  Lee press on nails  From strannies  Alright  Alright Jimmy  We'll let you be  Yeah  No I believe you  I figured that was  I heard all the laughs  And everybody's having fun  And I'm here in my  Echoey apartment  Contributing  Wait can you guys  Can you guys hear him  Yelling in the background  And groaning  No  Oh he's  We're just trying to get the bed done 
[02:50:30]  He's human  What nationality are your movers  Um yeah  Well  Let me think  Do they golf  What's that  No no  Almost  They play the game of the foot  They get along with people  Who golf  They tend to live in the same  Neighborhood  Those golfers  Oh oh  Are they um  Do they make good pitchers  Good what  Do they make good ball players  Yes they do  Yes  Normally they do  They're good with a knife  And they're good with a knife  Do their young  Do their young children 
[02:51:00]  Always fall out the windows  Here in the city  Yeah  And choke on little pieces of candy  Yeah  It's not that I don't have window guards  It's just they chew through them  Yeah  But you're not talking about like  Type of people  Who's nine year old  Might stab an eleven year old  Girl pal  Maybe that type of person  Yeah  Oh  That's really awful  Alright  I know  I'll let myself be  I can't  Contributing nothing  I'm standing here  In a dusty empty apartment  Depressed  I can't believe you got  A Polish moving company 
[02:51:30]  Bunch of newfies  Alright  Thank you  Bye Jimmy  It was nice being your friend  Hey Bob  Why don't you help me  You're on the floor  You're out of your friggin mind  He's right up there  Jesus  That's what a friend does  A friend helps you move  Moving is the ultimate  Friend commitment  I offered my duffel bag yesterday  He wouldn't take it  We've all seen signs  I was going to do more  But then people would say  I'm ripping off Seinfeld  But that is the ultimate  I stopped myself  Buddy commitment  Where's Keith Hernandez  When you need him 
[02:52:00]  Alright  And you were actually  Very funny last night  No  Who  Who  Me  Hello  What are you talking about  What's that  Oh no my phone  My phone dropped out  Nice talking to you  Alright everyone  Jimmy thank you  Bye Jimmy  Alright we're going to let Jimmy be  We're going to go back to Bob Kelly  Oh Jesus  Where the hell were we  Oh the Barry Williams thing  So  So I'm thinking  Alright this sounds a little weird  You know  And I'm thinking like  He's got this whole thing in his head 
[02:52:30]  And then I reject him  And then you know  The Brady Bunch music is going to play  Really sad in the background  You know  Now know what we need  That's not it though  We need the Barry  We need the Brady Bunch  Instrumental music Anthony  Yeah  Where it's different versions  Depending on what they do  Remember  Well we do  We have like  Here's a happy little one  It's not quite the theme 
[02:53:00]  But  I was happy  Or this one  It's like happy stuff  Mixing the martini  Yeah but the show  Used to play  Different versions of the  You know  The theme  Depending on what was going on  This is just filler music  Yeah see  That's happy  They're all happy  They're coming home from school  La da da da da  La da da da  See  This is a  That's what I mean  Depending on what they were doing 
[02:53:30]  But then they had  They did have the sad one  That they would break down  Every once in a while  Like a  The old xylophone  We don't have the 
[02:54:00]  Yeah we don't  No  We need that one  We need the sad version  Because that's what I  It was always the one where  Like  Mrs. Brady would come into  Marsha's room  And she's having a problem  And it was that theme  Right  Very  Very subdued  You know  We need that one  And I was thinking  When I  I told Barry  Barry  Yeah I don't want you  To suck my cock  I was thinking  There it is 
[02:54:30]  This would be playing  In Barry's head  Like  Oh man  Why is he happy then  I don't know  It doesn't work  Oh yeah  We know what that's about  And the tiki came out  And his cock fell off  That's where he brought out  The gimp  Gimp's leaping  Anyway  So  Yeah that was the scenario  And I'm like  God  What do you do  So I called up Anthony  For advice  See 
[02:55:00]  I'm like Anthony  Here's the deal man  He wants me to go up  Way up into the  The hills of Bel Air  Or Beverly Hills  Wherever the hell he is  Right  And he wants me to sip  Apple martini  Smoke a cigar  And watch the sunset  And then  And then we'd have a barbecue  What do you think  Is going on up there  And then you remind me  Thank God  That he was married  With a kid  He was married  But it could  I even said  It could be a beard  That sounds a little odd  I said it sounds a little odd  For a guy  To invite another guy  Like that  Up to the  The hills 
[02:55:30]  Yeah  To watch a sunset  While you drink martinis  And smoke cigars  So you have to go  Because you can always say no  Yeah but that's  A pretty awkward no  To be in this situation  But then  Because then  He's probably thinking  Well what the fuck  Did you come up here for  Right  But then I'm thinking  Good radio  I have to say no  And then obviously  Two years later  I'll get to tell it on the air  That's true  But then I get there  And his best friend  A doctor was there  And it turned out  You know  To be  You know  A safe situation  Thank God 
[02:56:00]  And  And  I forgot to tell you  This part  The doctor  Who is  Probably Barry Williams age  Probably upper 40s  Whatever  Maybe 50  Whatever Barry is  These days  The guy swears  He never saw  The Brady Bunch  I'm like  How do you go through life  Growing up  Never seen one episode  Of the Brady Bunch  He swears  At least one episode  All around the world  He basically didn't really know  Barry  What Barry  You know  Did or used to do  When they became  Quote friends  Here's this friend thing again  I think it was like  His way to get into 
[02:56:30]  Barry's life  Like look  You know  Barry's probably sick  Talking about the Brady Bunch  I'll tell him  I never saw an episode  I don't even know  Who he is  That I might have seen him  On TV  You know  Doing something else  That's a little weird  For a guy to do that  Alright  That's kind of the  That's the thing  A girl does  Oh I don't know  Like isn't that how  Yoko got John Lennon  By saying  Oh I don't know  Who you are  Or what you do  Maybe I should have  Tried that with Opie  When we met  Yeah there you go  I don't know who you are  I never heard your radio show  Maybe we can be friends 
[02:57:00]  That's fascinating  You do radio  Huh  Alright well we gotta  Take a break  And then I guess  We'll play your audio next  Finally  Yeah  I had an awful experience  Moving down from Boston  Kind of reminded me  Listening to Jimmy  They just broke shit  Left and right  Lost stuff  Left stuff there  Because I had  I had  I had to go  Too bad they couldn't  Leave your  Leave your wife up there  To my wife  It would have saved  A lot of time  And trouble 
[02:57:30]  Forgot something here  I seem to be  Missing something  Where the hell  Boy  Sure is quiet  Around here  Jesus  Wouldn't that be great  Why couldn't they  Remember my vacuum  And my WAF jacket  And leave her there  Yeah  Oh they remembered  To bring her  Back home with you  Oh  Certainly did  What a nightmare  That was  You know what  Had happened also  I had to go back  I had to come down  To New York  She had to stay up there 
[02:58:00]  And supervise the move  And you know  I guess supervising the move  In between shots  Of Jack Daniels  Might have been a little  Stressful  While we're looking  Through binoculars  At girls changing  Yeah  Hey  At least make sure  Everything's out of the apartment  For God's sake  Open up the hall closet  Brand new vacuum cleaner  My AAF jacket  Remember that ski jacket  I was so proud of  It was the first radio station  I ever worked at  First colors  Of the radio station  You're very proud of that  Oh yeah  You know  Guy brand new in radio 
[02:58:30]  First yogurt cup  That I ever scraped  I had kept in there  We just gotta get  The rest of the goodness out  Wonder why you have  No friends  You annoying son of a bitch  I really know  I'm an ass  Don't get confused  And think that I'm  I'm a catch  Trust me  I stink  You aren't a catch  As a friend  You really aren't  I'll be the first  To admit  I stink  Anyway  Go ahead  Ant  Yeah  I'm just done  I just remembered  How awful that was  And 
[02:59:00]  They broke so many things  And just lost things  And they drop it off  And leave it  And there's no way  You can actually go  Through the boxes  While they're there  And go  Oh you broke this  So you have to wait  And fill out a claim form  And then I sent it up there  And the company was like  Gone or something  And it didn't  Didn't even acknowledge  The complaint form  That I wrote  Just to pay a bunch  Of crooks  The movers  But it does beat  Loading it up  With your friend  In a U-Haul  I did that 
[02:59:30]  I went back  Everyone has gone  That route  When you're younger  And you can't afford anything  You load your shitty furniture  Up in a U-Haul  I had to sell stuff  I had to fill the U-Haul  And as I was filling it  Sell shit that didn't fit  Oh I just break it out front  I don't even  This is  How long you're in LA  And you got a bunch of Mexicans  That will buy anything  For five dollars  Bob  This is how much  Of a dirt bag I am  In every aspect of life  I was moving out  Of my Northport place  To move to Boston  With Anthony  Anthony pulls up 
[03:00:00]  In the U-Haul truck  Most people will leave  The stuff they don't want  Or can't fit in the U-Haul truck  Nicely on the side of the road  And maybe other people  Drive by  Pick through it  And get a nice  Nice little treat  Yeah  On their Sunday drive  I smash things  So no one could take  Any of my stuff  Off the curb  You really are  Well you  For God's sake  Opie  We  AAF was paying  For the move  Now I could kick myself  In the ass  Because I could have  Hired a god damn mover  And had AAF pay for it  But I was so much 
[03:00:30]  In the mindset  Of what my life was  Which was  You're moving  Get a U-Haul  And move it yourself  So I thought  I was ahead of the game  Because AAF was paying  For the U-Haul  Which  They would have paid  For one for Opie also  But Opie goes  Dude  Just leave a little room  On the back of yours  And I'll just throw  My shit on there  Well I didn't know  You know how much  I had  There was no room  I was trying to  Pack this thing  It was like a puzzle  Where there was  About a foot and a half 
[03:01:00]  Of room left  In the back of this thing  So I pull up  In front of Opie's  And he starts  Berating me  For using too much  Of the U-Haul  Dude  That the company  Was paying for anyway  You used easily  80% of the truck  Of course I did  Easily  I would have used 90%  If I could have  Packed it like a human  And I'm not even  Exaggerating  At least 80%  I mean I'm talking  You should have gotten  Your own U-Haul  I'm talking maybe  You gave me three feet  You should have gotten  Your own U-Haul  Yeah your own U-Haul  But it's funny  So Anthony 
[03:01:30]  Anthony pulls up  And we don't know  Each other that well  At all actually  We're only doing radio  A few months  And he pulls up  To see me  Taking my VCR  By the cord  And I'm like  Spinning it  Like a cowboy  Over his head  And throwing it  And I'm smashing tables  And old TVs  This won't fit  This isn't going to fit  And then I had to  Drive up to Boston  In a full U-Haul  With the cats  With the frigging cats  Three  Four cats  In cat carriers 
[03:02:00]  Shitting and pissing  The whole way up  Where the cab of the truck  Just smelt like cat shit  And piss  The entire way up  And I was drinking  Like  And I'm stuck in traffic  The drive that normally  Takes about  I would say  With a U-Haul  It would probably take  A little over four hours  It took eight hours  To get from New York  To Boston  I was drinking  Jack Daniels  And beer  The whole way up  Where I'm driving  Down the Mass Pike  With a truck  Full of stuff  Completely intoxicated 
[03:02:30]  Why do you have  Four cats?  Do you have a  Freaking lesbian roommate?  Oh please  And the ex-wife  Love the goddamn cats  I fucking hate cats  Four cats  We started with one cat  And this is how it works  This is how it works  We started with one cat  And then she saw a kitten  Next door  And was like  Oh can't we have this  And if I said no  It would have been like  Forget about it  Another  World war  18  So I'm like  Okay  We have a male cat 
[03:03:00]  Yeah let's get a female cat  Alright  We get the female cat  And within  You know  A week  That cat's pregnant  Has kittens  Which she decides  To keep two of  Now I'm the crazy  Cat person of Huntington  I got four cats  Just  You know what it was like  To go through  A laundry bag  Like I used to  Just take my dirty clothes  And throw them in big  Garbage bags  And then go down  To the laundromat  Next to the bar  And sit there and drink  While your laundry  Is being done  And then  Half ass version 
[03:03:30]  Of folding it  So you'd wear  Wrinkled clothes  All the time  Do you understand now  Why I like dressing  A little nicer  I went my entire life  Dressing like shit  In shit clothing  That  And here's the point  You would open up  The bag  Of clothes  Because I would  Never have a dresser  Or put it away  They'd be folded  In the plastic bag  On the floor  You go to pull  A shirt out  You put it on  And go  What's  What's that smell  Oh I know  Right  That's cat piss  That's what it is  It's cat piss 
[03:04:00]  On my clothes  And you just see  This big streak  Of yellow  Down the whole  Pile of clothes  And it's just  And thank god  The smell of cat piss  Is so easy  To wash out  That you never  Notice it again  Oh  That's great  Nightmare  I moved a cat  From Buffalo  This was before  I met you  When I was doing  Buffalo radio  Making a whopping  14,000 a year  That's Buffalo  I had no money 
[03:04:30]  Whatsoever  And I rented  A U-Haul  To get my stuff  And my Honda  At the time  Back to New York  And I had a cat  That I had to  Bring back to New York  And the cat  I didn't have  A cat carrier  I just said  Ah fuck it  Let him go  Let him go  It's an 8 hour  Ride or whatever  Especially in a U-Haul  It's a long ride  The cat decided  It was scared shitless  That it had to hide  Under the brake pedal  Under the brake pedal  Under the brake  Where its nails  Were dug into the 
[03:05:00]  Whatever  The mat or whatever  What have you  Whatever it was  The carpeting that's down  You can't stop  Oh dude  The whole way  From Buffalo  I could not  Break  Not really an exaggeration  There were times  I had to break  You know  Slightly  And try to kick the cat  It was a nightmare  The cat would not move  So then  I had no money  I came home  From Buffalo  No money  No bank account  I had a few dollars  In my pocket  That I bought  Some dinner for myself  For the long haul  And I thought  I had enough money  For the tolls 
[03:05:30]  I had it figured out  To the penny right  Don't forget  No friends  Oh yeah  No friends  Of course not  And I get  That bridge  So  And I have to pay  The toll  And  Throw a cat  At his face  This goes back  About 11  Well shit man  Maybe 12  13 years now  Yeah  And because  Extra axles  I had to pay extra  That I wasn't thinking about  Uh oh  So now I'm like  Two or three dollars short  And I'm telling you  I have no money  It wasn't me being cheap  I just didn't have it  Yeah  I was so poor 
[03:06:00]  That I brought  All my empties  Because those were the days  That I was doing  Some good drinking  Nickel each  So I had all my empties  That I was going to cash in  When I got back to New York  To maybe get me started  I don't know  I mean I had tons  I mean thousands of beer cans  That I just collected  Like everyone does  They rarely bring them home  Right  So I  I had to pull over  Because they won't let me  You know  They were going to turn me around  I'm like  Look man  You know  I'm like  Well sorry  Turn you around  You hump  Let me over your stupid bridge  I don't think it was  Where you could just fill out  The paperwork back then  For some reason 
[03:06:30]  Because I remember  A discussion like  Well we're going to have  To turn you around  I'm like  What  So then I remember  That I had  In the back  I did have one other thing  That's right  I had a penny thing  Like it was a big  Oversized like  Beer bottle  Filled with pennies  And I was the only  There you go  Motherfucker  One  Two  Three  I think the dimes  Could fit in this thing too  But nickels couldn't  You know  The mouth of this  Oversized bottle  Can only fit pennies  And dimes  So I'm like  Oh my god  I have that back there  Okay  So I open the back 
[03:07:00]  With one of the transit cops  Or whatever they are  I open up the U-Haul  And all my beer cans  Start spilling out  All over the road  And then my cat  Jumps out  And starts running  All over the place  Oh great  The cat would be gone  Oh yeah  Bye bye  Somehow I was able to  You know  Get the cat back  But the guy  Actually reached for a weapon  Because all the beer bottles  Were spilling out  He thought I was like  Smuggling people  Into what  Long Island  Like he didn't know  What the hell was going on  Because I guess  I was parked on a slight incline 
[03:07:30]  So the  You know  The beer cans and bottles  Just start spilling out  Of the back of this thing  You can't take cores  East of the Mississippi  Yeah exactly  And I remember  He went for like  His weapon  Like what the hell  Is going on here  And I actually made  A dumb joke  That got nothing  I'm like  You don't think  I drank all these  Do you  Because there were just  Hundreds just  You know  Spilling out  Of the dumb thing  But whatever  At least  You reminded me  Something quickly  About the cat  Just running around  The cab  In the carriers 
[03:08:00]  The entire  Eight hour drive  Up  The entire  Eight hour drive  Four  Picture this  Four times  Making sounds  That you could only figure  Are belched up  From the bowels  Of hell  The cats  The cats  Hated the carriers  And let you know  The entire way  And then the  The ax 
[03:08:30]  Pad along  What's up  Yo  My wife  She wanted a cat  And I'm like  No I don't want  A fucking cat  She's like  No they take care  Of themselves  You don't have to  Walk on the  You know  Kitty little box  And all that shit  So I was like  Alright they take care  Of themselves  Like two months later  The cat got bit  By another cat  And it caused a boil  Right and the boil  Popped  And you could actually  Move the skin  And see the muscle  And shit underneath it  It was disgusting  Holy Jesus  Yeah  And so she's like  Oh we have to take it 
[03:09:00]  To the vet  It was like two o'clock  In the morning  When I noticed this  I'm like fuck you  The cat take care  Of themselves  Tell him to get in the car  Drive himself  To the fucking bed  Take care of himself  Take care of himself  My ass  You know I hate cats  I was brought up  A dog person  And it turns out  I went to an allergist  And I'm definitely  Allergic to cats  And this cat  I got in Buffalo  Was infested with fleas  If you look close  At my arms  There are scars  From flea bites  From fleas  Like you wouldn't  I could not  Get the fleas  Out of my tiny  Little crappy apartment  In Buffalo  I tried everything  I bombed the shit 
[03:09:30]  Out of it  And every time  You get bit by a flea  It's  I mean people out there  Know  It's like five days  Of just agony  I don't know  What is in a flea  Bite but it'll  Drive you nuts  It'll drive you  Almost a suicide  Same thing with my  And then they just  Start healing slowly  And then you'll  Get another one  And you can't  Get the damn fleas  Off your body  Or out of your apartment  Put on white socks  And they were just  Speckled with black  Speckled with black  And you're like  What is  Holy shit  There are fleas  All over the place  You lay down  Or I would  Go to get out of bed 
[03:10:00]  You put your feet  Down on the carpet  And they start  Jumping on you  My ankles are covered  In fleas  And I'm like  Oh this is great  Thank god the love  Of these cats  More than makes up  For the pain in the ass  That they were  And every bite  Takes forever to go away  And it's just agony  And fleas  And pissing on stuff  There was one time  Up in Ashland  When I lived up in Massachusetts  We lived on the second  Or third  Third story  Of the apartment building  And the cats 
[03:10:30]  Used to fight each other  Constantly  Running around the apartment  And the two  Smaller ones  The ones that were  The kittens  That were kind of  Growing up  One was on the windowsill  And one was stalking it  From the floor  Jumped at them  From the floor  Onto the windowsill  They both went  Through the screen  And fell out the window  And I'm just sitting there  Going  Maybe they're dead  And I really  I was really hoping  That they'd be dead  But those friggin cats  Three stories up  I looked down  There was a bush 
[03:11:00]  There was a hedge  Under the window  That was flattened  Dude it was flattened  And both of them  Were sitting there  Shaken  Looking up at the window  Like what happened  And the ex-wife  Is like  Run downstairs  I go downstairs  And there they are  Fine as ever  Not a problem  Not even a bruise  I was so hoping  I used to have a cat  That used to jump  Out on the third floor porch  And I used to make him  Jump from the middle window  And he used to have to  Like leap out  So one day  I was like 
[03:11:30]  Let me open the other window  That's right out to the porch  And I shut the middle window  But this dumb cat  Was so used to  Jumping to the middle window  I'm sitting there  With a girl  On a date  I let the cat out  And I jumped back  Through the middle window  And just smashed  Into the window  And fell three stories down  I looked out  And the son of a bitch  Was just lying there  Like a fucking asshole  Just lying  I was like  It scared the shit of him  I said bang  On the third floor  I thought somebody  Was trying to break in  And this friggin' cat  Just fell three stories  And it was fine  They're amazing 
[03:12:00]  I hate cats  Oh another thing about cats  Hey Bob  Yeah  I think we could be friends  That's a good one  I don't want to be a friend now  How about this one  When they're hacking up the hairball  And then it's like a grenade  That's ready to go off  You gotta pick it up  And try to move it somewhere  Where it's not gonna ruin a carpet  Or the furniture  They're up on your couch  Going  They start doing that heave thing 
[03:12:30]  You pick them up  Like a hot potato  And you gotta throw them  On tile  Or something  That when they finally  Hack up that  That wet  Dribble  It's not gonna ruin something  Hey  A couple things  Really fast  Big duties from Jersey  Big duties Jay  Sorry Jay  Anthony doesn't have friends  Because they have germs  Yes  Friends are full of germs  This coming in from Judy  From Boston  Judy  Opie  I still consider you a friend  Even if you did break  My hummels  And my dog  You clumsy ox 
[03:13:00]  Opie  Opie's gone  Opie lived at my mother-in-law's house  For like nine months  I was out of there  In two weeks  We both lived there  Because we had to move up to Boston  On such short notice  And my mother-in-law lived there  She had some room  So we figured we'd live there  Me, my ex  And Opie  Had his own room  And everything  And me and my ex  Are like  Alright  I can't take  Living with your mom  And she was like  I can't take 
[03:13:30]  Living with my mom  So we found a place  Immediately  Opie stayed there  For nine more months  Living with my mother-in-law  Breaking her shit  Like  He'd walk with the phone  And the phone cord  Would be knocking over  Alright, hold on  Hummels  That she had for years  Hold on  Explain the phone cord though  Oh god  You don't see phone cords  Like this ever  It was like  Am I lying  If I tell you  It's thirty to forty feet  It could get you  From one end of the house  To the other  And it was all rolled up 
[03:14:00]  Like when you hung it up  It had rolled itself up  Into a beach ball  Size tangle  So as he walks away  This wrecking ball  Is swinging  Just knocking down  Everything  Yeah, because  Half the telephone cord  Was in a knot  You know  So it was a perfect  Wrecking ball  You're right  As part of the knot  Like springs out  The wrecking ball  Would fly back  Toward the phone  And break anything  On the table  So it's like  Ah, one of my  Hummels  Seems to be broken  Where  I had the  Where  You're kidding  Oh no

[03:20:30]  At her own apartment  And it turned out  It was a condo complex  So you know  You got the condo  And then you have  The left condo  And the right condo  And you go up the stairs  If you're on the right side  Of the building  Those are your stairs  The left side  Is someone else's  And all of a sudden  You're in an apartment  That is yours  But completely reversed  She walked up the stairs  And walked in  And what was going on  Was like some teen  Their parents were gone  So it was like  A kegger going on  So here comes  This old woman 
[03:21:00]  Just hammered  Walks in the door  And passes out  On the couch  In the middle  Of a kegger  And you know  Hopefully everything  Was fine and dandy  And they left her alone  But I think  The daughter  Of the guy  That lived there  Had to wake her up  And send her back  Next door  She woke up  With I love cock  On her forehead  Jesus  She used to love  The grandma yay  I want grandma yay  We used to go  We told this story  Before quickly  We used to go out  Me and Opie

[03:22:30]  I didn't want to have  Too much fun  So let me get in the car  And I'd be like  Okay a few more minutes  And the torture thing was  I knew if I stretched it  A few more minutes  It would be more  Of a hell ride home  It would be more  I want to go home  And before I was  Familiar with the area  I'd have to have  Judy give me the directions  So it was like  Take a left  Over here  And then  I'd be completely lost  Go around the rotary  Go around the rotary
