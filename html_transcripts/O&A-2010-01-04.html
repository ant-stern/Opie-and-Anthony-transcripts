<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing review of Dick Clark's performance on New Year's Rockin' Eve, described as a "train wreck" and compared to "Weekend at Bernie's" due to his apparent cognitive decline and slurred speech.  The hosts also criticized the show's overall lack of energy and engaging content, contrasting it with their own envisioned, superior New Year's Eve broadcast.  They then moved on to a humorous discussion of the various New Year's Eve glasses trends, finding no clear "winner" among the designs.  The show touched upon the overly regimented nature of the Times Square celebration, contrasting it with past, more chaotic celebrations, and briefly mentioned Kathy Griffin's near-curse on CNN's New Year's Eve coverage and the "Balloon Boy" hoax.

The conversation shifted to the NFL playoffs and the controversial decision by the Indianapolis Colts to bench Peyton Manning. The hosts speculated on the impact of this decision on gambling odds and the overall fairness of the playoffs, with several callers offering their opinions. Bob Costas's attire and broadcasting style also came under fire.  Throughout this segment,  the hosts frequently used offensive language and made crude jokes, punctuated by a recurring bit about a past-due "instant feedback" bill.

A subsequent segment focused heavily on the Indianapolis Colts' decision to rest players, speculating about the impact of potential injuries on their playoff performance.  This transitioned into a lengthy discussion on the attempted underwear bomb terrorist attack, prompting debate on airport security, profiling, and the effectiveness of current security measures.  Callers contributed their thoughts, with many advocating for increased use of full-body scanners.  The hosts also reminisced about People's Express airline, highlighting its low fares and unconventional practices.  Jim Norton then recounted a humorous, exaggerated story about leading people out of a smoky movie theatre, followed by a discussion about the Burj Dubai building and the website "FastForwardBlowJobs.com".  The segment concluded with a discussion of Norton's movie roles, including a humorous anecdote about his audition for "Furry Vengeance."  Several callers participated throughout this segment.

A segment featuring guest Jimmy Norton focused on recent movie viewings and gambling experiences in Atlantic City.  The hosts and Norton criticized John Travolta's post-*Pulp Fiction* career, discussed films like *The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus* (highlighting its technical issues), *The Hangover* (deemed overrated), and the Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings series (with Norton expressing his dislike for fantasy).  Anthony Cumia detailed his luxurious stay at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, recounting his gambling experiences, interactions with casino staff and fellow gamblers, and a humorous encounter with female escorts.  The conversation included anecdotes about chaotic Christmas family gatherings, the merits of therapy, and speculation on Tiger Woods's future. Norton shared a story about a disastrous Christmas at his home, which led to his escape to Atlantic City.  The hosts engaged in various side conversations, including humorous descriptions of bowel movements and a discussion about overly revealing movie trailers.

The final segment consisted of loosely connected comedic anecdotes.  The hosts discussed the hypothetical cost of sex with prostitutes, followed by a joke about a man getting a massage to avoid cheating on his wife, only to cheat anyway.  Bad jokes about Obama's healthcare plan and awkward public proposals at sporting events were also shared.  A significant portion featured a YouTube video of Kenny's reaction to a Zamboni kid waving at the crowd, with the hosts commenting on Kenny’s perceived callous indifference.  A caller revealed that these kids often participate in a Make-A-Wish program, adding a layer to the humor.  Further comedic material included stories about a limo ride with Norton and Florentine, Norton’s disastrous New Year’s Eve, a negative experience with Atlantic City prostitutes, and a host’s girlfriend’s humiliation due to Chip’s awkward behavior.  The hosts also discussed video game experiences (Call of Duty and Borderlands), featuring a caller, Laszlo, and a video of a child’s disappointing Christmas Xbox gift, which sparked increasingly dark and morbid jokes.  The show concluded with a promotion for Jimmy Norton's stand-up performance.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Hi, I'm the Opie and Anthony Virus, and I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Good morning.  They sound a little different. 
[00:04:30]  They sound a little different, but that's okay.  They sound a little sharper, a little nicer.  A little crisper.  I kind of like that.  What were they doing in here?  Tinkling?  Tinkling or tinkering?  I hope they weren't tinkling.  I think they were tinkling on all the electronics.  Tinkling.  Tinkling.  Hi, everybody.  Happy New Year.  Happy New Year to you.  Actually, my New Year's resolution isn't to bitch, but I want to bitch because...  I don't really like the sound of this.  No?  Is there...  Maybe a shark kind of a... 
[00:05:00]  La, la, la, la.  Don't worry about it.  We'll have Mars figured out during the break.  It sounds very different.  Or maybe we're just not used to doing radio.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  We're just not used to the sound.  Good morning, everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We are live.  What day is it to prove we're live?  Fresh back.  Because I thought we were live when I was listening to us during the break.  Yeah, were we good?  I'm like, wow.  Opie and Anthony are...  Wait, I'm Opie.  Oh, that's right.  You get confused a little bit.  I believe it's 1-4-2010. 
[00:05:30]  You're one of those guys?  No, I just looked at my computer.  Is it an alt year?  We're out of the alt years?  Alt.  Yes, and boy, if you noticed, a lot of people were twittering and everything.  The glasses.  I think we were definitely onto something with the 2010 glasses.  The glasses.  Because it was just anarchy when it came to the glasses.  There were so many different types of glasses, and some people were wearing like hats, like  tiara-like hat things. 
[00:06:00]  They just gave up on looking through it with their eyes.  They're all fighting for the design, I noticed.  There wasn't one design that everyone went with.  Right.  Exactly.  And that was our point when we brought this to everyone's attention.  Yeah.  I guess the one I saw a little more than the others was the one I thought was stupid.  With the exclamation point.  Yeah.  That's the one I saw too.  Because now it's the year 20,101.  20,101.  Yeah.  Because that's what it looked like to me. 
[00:06:30]  But that's the one a lot of people went with.  Yeah, they had to even it out.  To balance out the zeros so you could look through the damn zeros.  Yeah, so you could still look through the zeros, but they had to balance out so the  two wasn't hanging off your head.  So they did put the exclamation point on the other side.  And the other one I saw was the one where you look through the one.  Yeah, well they made a fat one.  They made a fat one.  So you could have a little circle in the middle of the one.  And I saw the one where the one was completely clear.  It was just an outline of a one, like a glasses frame of a one, and then covered with 
[00:07:00]  some type of cellophane.  Yeah.  But yeah, not really a clear standout winner when it came to the 2010 silly glasses.  Who gives a shit?  It's a new year.  There you go.  Danny's got them.  Was that Travis's Twitter when it's like, hey, did anybody see the Nivea hat?  The Nivea hat.  The what?  Nivea.  Apparently the only guy with the blue Nivea hat bouncing together the thunder sticks. 
[00:07:30]  It was everybody in Times Square.  Apparently that was like the thing this year was just for them to hand it out.  So everyone that was standing there for 15 hours could be shills.  Well, what I like about the whole Times Square situation, I was that I was down there about  five, six hours before the big celebration when people were starting to gather or actually  people were there for some of these people were there for for hours.  They put them in pens is what I love about New York City. 
[00:08:00]  They they allow you to go down to Times Square to celebrate the new year.  And then they they get you the fuck out of there almost immediately.  You got to go.  They got to clean up.  Right.  And for most people, the party's just beginning because, you know, now it's the new year.  But they know they want you out of there immediately.  Immediately.  I mean, it's like a ghost town within a half hour, half hour, 40 minutes.  It's a ghost town.  There is no one there.  And they locked down the area.  So sanitation could clean up the joint.  It's become this very regimented thing that they like I said, they pen off areas. 
[00:08:30]  So there's a certain amount of people in each pen.  You got to get there early.  There's no leaving to go to the bathroom.  There's no drinking.  And then you look years ago.  Dude, it was just you showed up.  Oh, I know.  You showed up.  You squeezed into the crowd.  You're drinking.  You're pissing on the street.  And they didn't know how to breathe.  They didn't know how to get you out of there.  So those celebrations, you know, lasted pretty much the whole night.  They went all night.  It was just garbage all over.  They had to deal with for days. 
[00:09:00]  There's nothing fun about going down.  Now it's just this regimented military kind of.  All right.  And people want a good seat for what?  Yeah, you're not for a little ball that you can barely see.  You know, a little ball.  Do you know that's water for crystal?  And it's all kinds of LEDs.  I believe there's a million LEDs that are programmed to bloody bloody shut up.  You know, you can't even see the fucking thing.  No, they make it nice and big on TV.  See, we're looking at the CNN's coverage because Kathy Griffin. 
[00:09:30]  Watch out for her.  Oh, she's a mad.  She's a live one.  Look out.  Look out.  You can't see this fucking ball unless the camera zooms in on it and makes it nice and  big for you.  Yeah.  It's there right now.  Yeah, yeah.  It's there.  I saw it this morning and it's a tiny little speck on the top of a building.  But, oh, the revelers out there.  It's so great to watch the coverage on the, well, I chose to watch the New Year's Rockin' 
[00:10:00]  Eve, of course.  Well, we're going to get into that within a few minutes here.  Indeed.  When you get down to just a few minutes left before midnight, they are at a total loss  as of what to say.  And I mean, during the whole program they are.  They just seem to be at a loss.  So what's it like on the street down there?  And then they get some chick down there.  It's amazing.  The revelers are out here.  Yeah.  Just waiting to ring in 2010.  And you watch and go, they have nothing to say. 
[00:10:30]  Nothing.  Nothing.  And then three minutes left.  It's like, okay, we're counting down now.  Three minutes.  Yeah.  And let's go to Dick.  Yikes.  I tweeted this and I meant it.  I had a few people over.  Nothing crazy for New Year's.  Just a few friends and stuff and family.  And after Dick Clark did what he did, and we're going to get into it here, everyone  started going for their coats.  They were depressed and bummed out. 
[00:11:00]  For real.  Dude.  For real.  I'm not even making a joke.  Ah, come on.  All of a sudden I'm looking around and everyone's grabbing their coats.  Oh, we're going to go home.  I'm like, what's wrong?  Ah, we're just going to leave.  I believe.  And people needed about 15 to 20 minutes.  I was trying to explain this on Twitter.  15 or 20 minutes to get back into it.  Yeah, yeah.  They were so depressed and bummed out watching Dick Clark that they wanted to leave.  You know what New Year's Eve is about? 
[00:11:30]  It's about like, look, whether the year was good or bad, it's over.  I guess we had our ups, we had our downs, things like that.  And you just, it's hope.  Mope.  It's one of those things that's like, it's a new year, anything can happen, I know.  Don't go home with...  Mope.  Mope.  Right.  Let's not forget.  But New Year's Eve is something where you're like, there's hope there.  And then you just, Dick Clark's got to be the first thing you see and then you think, 
[00:12:00]  oh my God, I'm a mortal.  I'm a mortal person with this thing there, but for the grace of God.  I don't understand why they don't state the obvious.  Maybe because then they wouldn't have a gig next year like Ryan Seacrest.  Oh, Ryan.  How do you make believe that there's nothing wrong with this guy?  And then the next day or two days later, they're saying, oh, the ratings for Dick Clark's  Rockin', whatever the fuck he calls it.  It's New Year's Rockin' Eve.  Is up another 20% from last year and blah, blah, blah. 
[00:12:30]  Dick Clark did it again.  And I'm sitting there reading this shit going, no, people are watching because it's a train wreck.  And why doesn't anyone say that except us?  I know.  It's a fucking train wreck.  I think everybody does say it, but not in the media.  They're just like, oh, the bravery, the this.  You see him kissing his wife and everything was just kind of like, oh.  You can't wonder why Ryan Seacrest doesn't mention the stroke.  I don't blame him for not.  We did this radio show.  You can't go, why doesn't Ryan talk about the stroke? 
[00:13:00]  You know what?  But you know what?  At this point, Ryan is as big as Dick Clark.  So I would be, if I was Ryan, I'm like, look, let's get rid of the old man.  This is my show.  We all know it.  This is it.  It really is Ryan Seacrest Rockin' Eve.  They needed a couple of years as a transition, but at this point, it's obviously his.  I was counting how much Dick Clark was on camera, and it was like less than two minutes total time.  Something like that. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  Something like that.  Maybe close to three minutes total time he was on for that whole fucking broadcast.  And can they just drop the rockin' part?  No one's rockin'.  There was not a bit of rockin' going on when they had Fergie hosting the rockin' portion from Vegas.  Right.  And all I saw was horrid drivel that was nothing that was rockin'. 
[00:14:00]  I think next year we got to do some kind of something something.  Yeah.  Some kind of live broadcast.  Oh, and A Rockin' Eve.  Oh, yeah.  We would get huge ratings for that.  And we'll sound just like Dick Clark for everybody.  Of course.  Yeah.  I said that Dick Clark and Ryan Seacrest was like watching Weekend at Bernie's.  It really was awful.  And who had J-Lo?  Just prop him up.  Who had J-Lo?  Yeah, that was New Year's Rockin' Eve.  Because J-Lo...  J-Lo on stage outside.  Well, did you guys see the picture that was all over the internet of her looking like... 
[00:14:30]  Fucking what's his name?  From Silence of the Lambs.  Jame Gum?  Yeah.  You haven't seen that yet?  No.  Oh, no.  People were like comparing that to James...  Oh, no.  Jame Gum doing the tuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Doing the tuck.  Oh, you haven't seen that yet?  No.  Oh, it's classic.  Doing the tuck.  Because at one point she puts her arms up in the air like J-Lo did in Silence of the  the Lambs.  Fuck me.  Fuck me.  Dirty mechanics fingernails.  Oh, clicking his nipples. 
[00:15:00]  Before we do the Dick Clark...  Because Kathy Griffin, she's just...  She's just terrific.  Oh, wow.  She's just crazy.  crazy you don't know what she's gonna do he's a mad woman i guess they said if she cursed that she  would have to give her money back it was in her contract or something so oh wow so the big buzz  was is kathy griffin gonna curse again on cnn was that the big buzz that was the big buzz out there  and uh this is how it went down i want to show you some of the the news makers from this past  year just get your take on them okay uh let's not do him no let's not do him okay let's do this 
[00:15:30]  do you remember all right oh that's richard heaney of course and uh i admire their stick to it in this  yeah i admit that i followed the balloon boy scandal did you watch it when it was happening  oh of course i did my favorite moment was when here when balloon boy falcon said who the hell is  i'm sorry to interrupt who is that guy interviewing her that's anderson cooper who should who should 
[00:16:00]  be the 2010 should be the year anderson cooper takes over for larry king yeah and dick clark is  out and ryan seacrest is in but do you hear what's happening there like he's we're talking about  something they have her on because she's a comic she's trying to get to a joke and this dummy just  keeps jumping he has no idea that she's trying to get to a joke she's he's just stomping he's  trotting upon us it's funny because she's like yeah and then she actually said to anderson did you  watch it and his thing should have been uh yeah i did and then she would have went to it but he's  like yes i did and my favorite part oh no no what are you doing your favorite no no my favorite part 
[00:16:30]  is my punchline dummy i'm trying to get to here yeah it was happening oh of course i did my favorite  moment was when here when balloon boy falcon said who the hell is wolf falcon heaney  well that was it that was our big uh that was just forced but it's all over the internet because  she's crazy it drove me nuts well that is not uh that wasn't even a creative way to fit it in oh 
[00:17:00]  it's not even you like it to me no no no can i speculate that what that was you're scaring me over  there what that was oh oh was that she was was a moment of i her joke was probably the same uh  thing of she was probably gonna make fun of the kid for blowing it or something and then when cooper  stepped on what she was gonna punchline i think that was just a move like uh like she didn't know  what to say i think she just got caught out there and improv something no i don't even know if it was 
[00:17:30]  mad or fucking falcon like she just tried to improv something i think because she kind of got caught  out there with a punchline blown should have left her alone i don't know if that's i don't know  that's anger or just a bad a bad improv well she she had a curse because that's the big thing with  her she's gonna be cursing on cnn even though cnn is a cable outlet and it doesn't matter by the  way it's allowed so as you fucking go to youtube and watch the video because you can't believe it  just keep in mind it's a cable fucking outlet and you could curse on there because she was going 
[00:18:00]  to a joke about did you did you watch it and cooper's like yeah like if he had just said yeah i did  i don't think she would have said what was the kid's name fucking falcon yeah yeah she would  have done something and but i think that it was probably along the same thing that his is now  danny oh my god now danny can't find the actual internet posting of this but he did his own there  you go j-lo looking like james come from that's funny silence wow she does look like she's doing  the talk doesn't she god damn stupid j-lo when they're freezing outside is she yeah in her body

[00:21:00]  clark's thing for doing this is is it it's i want to be i don't know whether to be annoyed at him or  not like it's like sometimes you got to go time to move on i'm annoyed at the network because you  know there's there's there's young and young younger people in media that deserve a nice shot you think  he's under contract and i think he owns the show or it'll look so but yeah or he owns no i think he  owns the show it's dick clark's new year's rock and he refuses to to step aside i mean he could it  could still be his show see him in a meeting suck my dick motherfucker like he's just real angry and 
[00:21:30]  yelling in that voice i think we have a situation here where he owns the show the ratings are great  every year at this point they're great because we're watching a stroke victim yeah yeah for real  i i don't i have i don't get any warm feelings when i watch dick clark i i like i keep saying i you get  depressed yes and he refuses to step aside and just be the behind the scenes guy that owns the  show and you think they're afraid if they just go look we're going to go to someone else then it 
[00:22:00]  would then people wouldn't just go there automatically maybe they just go there just a it's a it's a fun  it's a mess to watch and b it's where you go dude most people are tuning in dick clark because he  sounds like that there's no way around it would i mean maybe maybe before the stroke there was  something about dick clark that you had to watch it was like tradition or something but now  it's because he has the stroke would you tune in if it was just ryan seacrest and they're  rocking eve well then it would just be him doing it there then you got the mtv coverage and then 
[00:22:30]  you got cnn's coverage so you know it would be up for grabs right who would be the big winner  but you wouldn't just tune in ryan seacrest doing it right no i'm tuning in because dick clark  right but the problem is most people will not admit that in mainstream media that that all these  people are watching because he yeah it's a fucking train wreck that's why i tuned in right i just  wanted to see dick clark so what i would suggest is the rest of the network cnn and mtv get fucking  oh god fucking people with horrendous speech impediments and start competing with dick clark

[00:26:00]  communicate to do that just because of the nature of the gig yeah if you're a golfer and you lose  both arms uh you could hold the club in your mouth and try to swing but you're really going to be  distracting and not very good at it of course but and that's kind of his job is to convey the  festivities what's happening intros it's an announcer yeah and if you can't really you know  jibba jabba it's amazing i mean we got a bunch of these guys out there larry king has no business

[00:40:30]  not by a long shot uh we put together a look back  a dick clark yes yes kind of less we forget for the old for the old schoolers remember the buddy  epson thing we're doing with dick clark yeah yeah we'll start with um when did he have his stroke  first do you know around two or two oh six maybe i think you'll be able to tell yeah yeah 
[00:41:00]  exactly i don't think there's any doubt well we'll go we'll start with uh 2004 countdown  2004 yes countdown yes nice this is dick clark a mere five six years ago  yes indeed it's getting closer and closer count it down 20 19 18 17 etc etc we're gonna get there  yes indeed  in 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 happy 2004 
[00:41:30]  a little slow though he was but that was just a guy who's a little older he got etc etc etc etc like  even he understands counting from 20 is silly he was smooth though yeah and then he got 10 you go  you're good and then it's happy 2004 not just happy new year he was smooth there yeah then we move 
[00:42:00]  on to uh 2006 i guess i guess he had the stroke in 2005 oh so he didn't do it at all right i think  he was gone in 2005 he came back in 2006 that's true because it was right before new year's eve i  think and they were all speculating will he be able to do it and uh the boy we realized later on oh stop  it and if you remember we all thought it was over for dick clark he's never going to be doing this  again he's he's done five now or four for these six doctors were counting down his pulse yeah at that 
[00:42:30]  point right so he skipped 2005 and here he is in 2006 counting it down 50 40 13 12  one eight seven six five four three two one happy 2006  better if he says the date better if he says the day yeah yeah yeah better than happy do year do  year but now it's happy do year but he's fucked up the count also who didn't say happy do year and 
[00:43:00]  who did not write happy do you everyone was running texts and uh twits especially this radio show but  then elsewhere i saw people were doing it that have nothing to do with this radio show it's just  that's what you do now in honor of dick clark it's happy do year poor dick then we get to uh 2007 here  he has a problem with 10 i think or something and then he just can't get all the numbers out 
[00:43:30]  but he kind of had a comeback there yeah but i mean he was the second off number yeah he was the  second off but i was expecting it to be worse and then uh 2008 we're getting there folks we're getting 
[00:44:00]  there 2008 what do you got it just see from a short you know it's several several numbers  20 19 18 70 60 50 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 happy do year 
[00:44:30]  that was the famous happy do year he got the count there he was a little behind but  he didn't miss any numbers and then he finishes it off with the famous wow it wasn't happy do year and  i remember when that happened we were like whoa what's up with dick clark that wasn't that bad  that wasn't happy do year exactly i mean there's a major drop off starting with uh last year 2009 
[00:45:00]  oh this is  better it was actually better like every other year is uh is good yeah man miss this year was just  and then finally this year where it gets real sad all right let's count it down 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 12 10 
[00:45:30]  11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 happy new year  yeah that was the worst one yeah that was the worst one i gotta say that yeah that was the worst

[00:46:30]  you know i think i want to think of dick clark is in that scene in forrest gump when jenny is walking  out of the hotel and he's in the back doing the rock what was that 79 going into 80 i think  where's that 69 going into 70 it's like he's been doing that fucking for a long time  i think that's what he said 37 years so early 70s he started this uh what what's the 2010 so 73 i  guess yeah 73 come on yeah i mean blood sweat and tears played i think something like that three dog 
[00:47:00]  night i like blood sweat and tears you like blood sweat and tears of course what goes up must come  down spinning wheels round and round let's take our first break we're back it's uh monday january  4th and then yeah but we're back 2010 oh by the way i was watching a van halen video with sammy  hagar it was on and i forget the song but there was the moment where michael anthony and sammy  just kind of making like funny eyes at each other and i'm like we're back video it really was yeah 
[00:47:30]  cheese dicks they stink i'm sorry to say it van halen fans i can't listen to him  could have a little respect for sammy hagar one of the coolest guys great voice one of the coolest  fucking guys you'll ever meet dude even with david the band was just i'm sorry they were overrated i  know people hate me for saying that jamie's crying really  uh what it more shenanigans from steve from bay short along the same lines as the other ones 
[00:48:00]  blood sweat and tears is what's found in big a's trunk  but it just sounded certain someone's pillow yeah i thought it was his underpants  sure glad big a is eating better jesus fucking christ is he really jesus i got involved with his  medical problems i don't know how that happened but i wrote a couple checks to make sure big a  fucking lives this year and he's tweeting pictures of chicken wings fuck big a you should pay the  goddamn instant feedback yeah it's more important to the show hey you know what big a fuck you and

[00:52:30]  really connected in the sports world to really get the facts out there for us on that story i got  a gangster yo he is he doesn't give a shit about being in the nba all he wants to do is play poker  he's holding up his own fucking teammates with guns and shit just amazing have you heard this  story jimmy i've only heard about the guns found in the locker there's latest info the more info in  today's paper it's unbelievable what's his name uh arenas uh uh gilbert arenas right yeah we'll get 
[00:53:00]  into that and everything else that happened during the break uh we did dick clark i said i'll go  fuck yourself uh yeah you're doing well it's officially not worth shit exploding underpants guy  oh my god we need to talk about the uh  all right why don't we do a quick break we'll throw the ball around a little more  opie and anthony it's good to be back stay there  opie and anthony a lot of people uh talking about the jets on the phone lines j-e-t-s jets jets jets 
[00:53:30]  yeah we backed into the playoffs oh sounds sexy i mean i'm happy i'm a jets fan  but uh the last two games for the jets both teams pretty much laid down for them and that's why  they're in the playoffs so it's a little weird you were talking about this uh earlier and i really  didn't uh what the hell i didn't realize this was going on but this is what happens every year at the 
[00:54:00]  end of the season it's like you're watching pre preseason football because you got teams out  there they don't want any of their big stars hurt for the playoffs so they're sitting a lot of their  guys and then teams are walking into the playoffs without even having a challenge without deserving  it so i don't know i mean i'm happy for rex ryan and sanchez and the rest of the boys that they're  in the playoffs but the colts lay down i i'm amazed that the colts did that i i swear i told anthony 
[00:54:30]  here's my next prediction by the way oh uh by the way aha by the way you said you were going to bet  the farm when i said that the jets would beat the colts i said that before we went on break i know  because i knew what was going to happen i mean i'm not no fucking kreskin i i knew that the colts would  probably sit their boys because they didn't really need to win anymore i saw the schedule it's the only  reason i said the jets were going to beat the colts by the way i'm not that smart i didn't think that  was going to happen and they did exactly that they they sat everyone after what the first half or 
[00:55:00]  something and let the jets beat them ruining their perfect season ruining their momentum  fucking with the football gods and i'm telling you right now the colts will not win the super  bowl they will not win the super bowl they fought everything up was it a blowout i don't even remember  anymore because it was uh it was you know a couple weeks ago now i don't even remember but the colts uh  lost to the jets and then they lost to the bills yesterday they haven't played competitively in two 
[00:55:30]  weeks then they have a bye week and then they're going to finally play by the time they play an  actual football game again with everybody in their positions doing what they do it's it's close to a  month they fucked it up i'm telling you the colts aren't winning shit sorry to the colts fans out  there but you fucked with the football gods because you got everybody just arguing well should they have  sat payton should they have done this blah blah blah there's a major distraction everyone's still  talking about it and then the jets uh walk into the playoffs because of that and yesterday i mean 
[00:56:00]  the bengals uh laid down for the jets yeah they laid down it was uh i was watching the game it was uh  the bengals uh third and 16 what do you do when it's third and 16 anthony i would say put that ball in  the air they ran the ball i'm like okay i see what's going on here yeah i see what's going on here  what what the fuck is that that's a new intern i love they put signs on them and everything and 
[00:56:30]  then they just walk in  a new intern what are you gonna do what do they do wrong with the crickling bag  well yeah well they all do that that's like a rookie uh uh intern thing to do but he's got signs  all over i love how they walk in they don't realize that we might be trying to actually do something i  i know i know i guess we just look like a show that you just kind of pop in and do things here's  your change tony thanks a lot what's the matter dude yeah we'll talk to the new intern later in 
[00:57:00]  the week we have too much other shit to talk about uh sean and georgia hey over hey buddy before i get  to my point a little fact you're talking about the cult losing to the jet no team that ever has lost to  the jets in the regular season has won the super bowl but also the uh with the bangles last night  they absolutely they helped the bangles team to one yard the first half and they were playing their  starters the whole time yeah but it just it was i i i i understand i understand the jets looked very 
[00:57:30]  very good defensively uh last night that i didn't watch the whole game so i gotta i gotta i gotta at least  tell you that but it just seemed like the bangles were kind of kind of kind of kind of being a  little soft the entire game no the third and 16 you were talking about is if you're backed up far  enough to your end zone what you do is you run it to try to get a little extra space so your punter  isn't no i know i know i know the basics of football but i understand that too but it just seemed like the 
[00:58:00]  bangles were just kind of saying look you know this is how it's going to be we let them win we let  them win i don't know what do i know it's i'm just trying to fill up time you're literally monday  morning quarterbacking ocho cinco what did what did the paper say the paper called it's so funny ocho  stinko thank you go i'm happy for the jets what the hell we'll see what happens yeah be happy for 
[00:58:30]  um couple weeks ago that their chances that at a playoff berth were not looking good and now  they're in eddie in st louis what's up eddie well i think i think that the colts really had an  obligation uh to history and you know to people who are real fans of the game to leave manning in  there i think that uh no someone made a hell of a lot of money on that decision to pull him out i  think it was bullshit and it's like it's like a glitch in the matrix i couldn't believe it i'm  sitting there watching it and it it really shocked me it makes me not want to watch football anymore 
[00:59:00]  and in case i think you i think you don't have a choice if you have a perfect season going it's  late in the season yeah i understand the injury thing but i don't think you have a choice i think  you got to keep your guys in there and try to get that perfect season done i really do game in in  this last decade it's going to be up there with like bush v gore as one of the most controversial  things that happened no you're wrong dude no one is thinking about it and people are talking about  it now but no one will be thinking about it i'll tell you why because the patriots already did  another undefeated season and they went through the playoffs and you know what they lost the 
[00:59:30]  super bowl all anybody remembers is that they lost the super bowl but they had a shot at it jimmy  all we have is to be haunted with the undefeated season doesn't mean what it would have had the  patriots not done it a couple years ago the patriots just did it but and they blew the super  but they lost the super bowl yeah we want an undefeated season with the team and the super  and the team winning the super bowl i say they right i look i understand as a fan but now see  they kept they should have they should have rested because he got hurt you'd be complaining he got 
[01:00:00]  hurt but if they didn't arrest him then they should have arrested the guy before the game and been  classy about it announced it yeah this proves my point this is what's going on though everyone's  discussing this instead of saying hey let's uh focus on the playoffs they're still discussing this  in indianapolis isn't this a kind of a thing where it can affect uh your sports betting  fucking like that guy said someone made a lot of money a lot of money exactly because i mean the  colts losing to the jets please that's not supposed to happen yeah so i mean if you're a 
[01:00:30]  gambling man and you were smart enough to go wait a minute they might sit you know peyton manning  here yeah there's some people that made a lot of money uh uh doing that sports betting what was  absolutely what was the score after the first half can we look it up danny and see what the  square of the jets and and and colts were after the first half but this does prove my point because  they're still disc i'm telling you there's they were discussing it yesterday still yesterday  now they got a bye week peyton manning hasn't been in a competitive game in in two weeks i just  think those guys are good enough where a month's rest is going to be seen as a month's rest and not 
[01:01:00]  they're not going to get rusty they're even arguing this uh point within the organization by  the way yeah that you know mafia oh oh and hates football football organization you hate  football don't you know no i don't hate football i hate basketball it was not but uh football i  like football you know what's going on in the nba you should appreciate and love basketball why should  i love that it's uh some type of illegal uh illegalities going on i don't like that at all 
[01:01:30]  the culture winning nine three at half at the half yeah it was a game and then what was the final  score again uh i was 29 15 29 15 mba's full of thugs yeah thugs yeah let me say hi to tattoos we  can't see stop it already why don't black guys just get get really really like light color tattoos i  don't understand yeah that would look white ink doesn't work go to the lighting doesn't work it's  so they get the dark ink and it just looks silly i'm sorry doesn't work rape kit 
[01:02:00]  yeah opie you're fucking wrong the jets had every intention of destroying the cincinnati bangles  the only person in the cincinnati bangles who decided not to play he was arrested was their  running back who's a good running back granted but the bangles tried their hardest to win that  game so they could get the three seed and they did nothing thanks for bouncing me by the way from 
[01:02:30]  pal talk again you dick why'd you bounce them i dare why don't you what'd you do i don't know i  i said i'm on the phone i was being a silly goose oh what's your uh what's your name on there  ray p kit all right i'll put you back on just don't be a shithead  it's hard for me apparently we're just done with people being shitheads in general  we're just done with it all right rape kit what can i tell you i only watched the first half  what you know that's all i know and yeah after the first half you didn't think that the bangles 
[01:03:00]  were trying i mean they would they they had seven yards in total offense carson palmer went one for  eleven i understand the jets the jets shut them down you're absolutely right but you know what you  can't look into it for the next game because you know the bangles at home they're going to try  harder they're going to have their star running back you know i mean the only thing the jets have to look  forward to is that they're going to roll from this victory on to the next one okay but it's a  bigger point i mean the end of the nfl season like i said it's pre-season games the bangles 
[01:03:30]  yeah they would have liked to be the the third seed but they're in the playoffs so they are also  playing from from a point of view where they don't want their guys hurt you know what i mean so maybe  they're not trying as hard in general yeah maybe not but you know that's all i'm saying and and it  happened but you got darrell revis who's going to shut down chad johnson no matter what chad johnson  who's that who's chad johnson well he has to apparently he has to change his name back because  he told bob costas that if darrell revis shuts him down to no catches he'll change his name back 
[01:04:00]  to johnson you know what from that stupid ocho cinco shit did you see bob costas and his stupid  hat last night no oh and and his uh soy sauce fucking uh die job you think liam neeson dies uh  with soy sauce you got to see but what bob costas is doing bob costas was wearing a blue uh uh nivia  hat it was one of those fucking it's like a danny hat it looks good on danny but bob costas was 
[01:04:30]  wearing your hat last night looks good on you though right oh wow it was a black or dark uh real dark  blue one last night and it was freezing so you know his ears were still exposed so why are you  wearing the hat it's not a head warmer no he was trying to make some kind of fucking statement with  his dumb hat last night i fucking hate bob costas do you i hate him with all my heart wow i'll tell  you why i am a sports fan in general maybe uh rape kid you know a little more than i as far as this 
[01:05:00]  jets game goes but bob costas if you watch the winter classic for for the hockey fans out there he's  trying to make moments he's a guy he's trying to be he's trying to be al michael doing the next you  know the miracle yeah even miracle bob costas is all about forcing these moments upon the viewer  the winter classic at fenway park you got the flyers the bruins you don't really have to say much it's  just fucking cool but bob costas is fucking trying to make these moments with these like pre-produced 
[01:05:30]  packages and just just pushing these moments down your throat it's like bob will you relax and just  fucking call it how you see it you don't really need to do much more here it's just cool all right  rapey kit yeah oh quick quick quick prediction of the uh playoffs yeah and shut up the uh bangles  bangles go down to the jets and then the jets face indianapolis in the following week and they  destroy indianapolis that all depends if they played a two three defense dog they're gonna run the nickel 
[01:06:00]  the giants don't have a chance dog that it all depends uh they're gonna and i talked to the  coach he said he's healthy but if they're gonna run the three four in the slot then i don't want to  know the defense shut up you're not a sports talk radio fan no i am actually but when they get too  crazy russo i like because he's an interesting guy he's out of his mind but he's fun he's to me he's a  fun guy to listen to benningo's a fun guy to listen to because they're real fans but you know 
[01:06:30]  francesa just drives me nuts because he's just a boring dude russo has questionable sexual preferences  what what are you implying stop looking at the outline in my slacks dog  his slacks are a little too tight and a little too high something's going on with that russo i'm  talking right now he's a chris is a weird dude i'm telling you right now that's the problem  someone my cock is showing what's up with russo you can see the male camel toe 
[01:07:00]  tried to do a show and i'm looking at that big delicious treat dog fantastic  you look down at my pants what are you going to see you're going to see a big  i keep my balls on one side i keep my penis on the other i can see the shadow of the cap across your  thigh  someone's saying i'm not a jet fan if i didn't watch the colts game i watched the  fucking game it was a couple weeks ago i don't remember you know the final score i'm sorry on 
[01:07:30]  that let's go to dustin dustin how are you buddy doing all right happy new year yeah you too brother  yeah all right uh all i wanted to say is on that uh right kid or whatever i'm pretty sure cincinnati did  go to lose it because i get to play the jets again which is an easier game because sanchez is a  rookie quarterback and i've never been in the playoffs so should be an easier game for them  if they would have won they would have had a tougher schedule coming up through the playoffs i think you're  right about that you know the jets really backed into the playoffs i mean you gotta you gotta at least 
[01:08:00]  admit that the colts the colts gave him a christmas gift and it's gonna i'm telling you it's gonna hurt  the colts in the end pull this tape colts do not win the super bowl oh boy they do not win the super  bowl no i don't think that dude it's a new year and i'm telling you it's a new year this sports curse  is off it's over that was that's so 2009 thank you sir i worry about your cowboys they well they  were great i mean and and then they left romo in too long like in the last five minutes the fourth 
[01:08:30]  quarter there was up i think it was 24 nothing he should have been fucking out but they said that  he's just they're kind of exercising the demons from last year like they've beaten philadelphia  earlier this year they were just trying to kind of like really crush them completely i think because  uh you know and they have to play him again next week too which kind of worries me because i don't  think you're gonna beat the philadelphia three times who the fuck made this schedule where they're  playing the same team two weeks in a row it was just no i know it's i know it's  if philadelphia won though they would have won the division and had a bye week so philadelphia 
[01:09:00]  did not lay down they don't know it was a big game for the eagles absolutely and then the  fucking giants what what was the final there 44 7 i turned it off at 44 zip like a smash a  little smashing down there so all right uh let's go to rick and rocklin rick hey there rick  just a little little fact about the cults every time they've been that far ahead and they've gotten  the bye week and they have sat their players they have never won the super bowl they've never even 
[01:09:30]  gotten to the super bowl the last time that they won the super bowl they were a wild card team  and had to keep their players fresh and play every game because every game mattered  yeah huh this ought to be said for momentum but i also think if you got guys that are  they may have had some guys who were kind of banged up and they didn't talk about  who uh who they sat maybe manny had an injury they didn't talk about or somebody else did and they're  like no way i'm sorry yeah you're right why would that be a possibility you're right yeah you're  right 100 no way that was crazy of me to say that and maybe towards the end of the year players 
[01:10:00]  banged up what a crazy speculation i'm fucking a sucker all day without a cell on sunday believing  i had to listen to no no you're right dude i don't know why i would think that maybe an athlete  had some sort of an injury after game 14. yeah you're right that was crazy of me not counting all  the hard practices they do you would think i just said maybe manning was wearing a dildo hat  the way he reacted but then no way it would be hey man people yeah people are passionate about  their sports talk jimmy but if he would have said no i don't think that's it that's an appropriate 
[01:10:30]  response sir to me manager said earlier that he was not interested in the 16 and 0 season  he even went against the coach and if you see the post-game interview from that game  made the look on manning's face with a look of disgust and he took the high road and he said  well i have to do with no i don't run the team i don't run the team the fans and that whole entire  team wanted to go 16 and 0 so they could stick it to the fucking patriots yeah yeah i'm telling  you man it was a horrible move definitely and it does hurt them in the end fuck them but maybe here's 
[01:11:00]  the thing how do you know in the first half of that game somebody didn't pull something or feel a  little banged up and they're like fuck it this is ridiculous plus there's there's plays you could be  calling with peyton in there that's a little safer too so you you kind of hedge your bet as  far as injuries go i'm telling you it was a hard maybe he had a train over the night before he was  a little tired i feel i feel bad for the calls because they that now they just go down as having  a pretty good year and they do not win the super bowl sorry culture and the cowboys are 13 and three 
[01:11:30]  i think 13 and three uh last year and they got the dog shit kicked out of him in the playoffs  nope the regular season to me as far as what how well did they do is not nearly as important as  to what happens in the playoffs um and this guy i'm like yeah maybe uh manny had an injury you  fucking lunatic how do you not oh that's a hundred percent impossible  thank you bye uh yeah enough on the colts i'm sure well we made our point whatever whatever your 
[01:12:00]  point i yeah what the fuck do we really know i um yes anthony i just quickly want to do that we  don't even have to get into the whole uh uh thing but the listeners that have been listening to this  program for a while might remember back in i think it was even the wnew days i had an argument uh with  the man named uh lew black oh and i pointed out that yemen was a problem i was laughed at by lew 
[01:12:30]  black is there any way to pull that clip laughed at by lewis black who who who who was stunned that  i was so crazy to insinuate that yemen what was the quote what i believe i said fuck yemen or no i  think it said what about yemen what about yemen was the famous like it was like what about yemen and  he goes yeah talking about yemen sometimes louis doesn't have a point to make so he'll just go to  yemen what are you crazy no it wasn't even that it was because then it got into a conversation 
[01:13:00]  about yemen and how i was saying this is a a place where they're terrorists they're harboring  terrorism and now it seems to be you know the new hot spot the new velvet rope place for fucking uh  al-qaeda and uh i yeah it only took 15 years to make hand right yes thank you i don't think it was  that long but yeah yes yemen yeah yemen seems to be a problem i have yemen yeah that's uh you know  another place where all these assholes are coming out of like that fucking skinny that got on the 
[01:13:30]  plane dude christ on a pony how do we fight against guys that are willing to fucking set fires to their  fucking balls underwear well game over i'm sorry someone has to say it game fucking over there's  not an american alive willing to fucking blow up their balls for the cause can i ask how silly you  feel how silly do you feel as your dick and balls are are roasting and you notice uh-oh no plane  blowing up yeah i'm actually we're descending i'm actually being told to put down my put my trade table 
[01:14:00]  up as my cock and balls are on fire having a perfect landing yes and my balls are burning and this is  to remind you to prepare the cabin for landing and sir could you put out your cock and balls which are no  longer functional holy shit are you right but how do you fight against that war when guys are willing  to do that the way we beat the japanese the japanese were willing to do it the japanese were willing to  give up their lives they would have parties before they know i understand the giving up your life nuke 
[01:14:30]  them yeah giving up your life but uh to fucking fucking do it by blowing up your own balls that is  that is a mentality that we don't understand he had explosive underwear that he had the you know the  whatever the explosive was and then and then he had a little syringe with the accelerant in there  is this too inside but did anyone else see the the picture of the underwear that was on the front  page of the paper and think tippy tom's underwear to be tom might have been a terrorist i'm not a 
[01:15:00]  terrorist right that's it be tom this fucking guy i've been now and now i just hate how we react to  now everybody not there's now you're not allowed to use the bathroom on planes stop about some at  least they're starting to talk about profiling in some way shape or form where uh people that are  getting on these planes in foreign countries that are getting on planes from countries that are known  sponsors of terrorism are going to be searched more than other people that to me is a good start 
[01:15:30]  because it's profiling the people that are doing this why right after this happened you had to  listen to interviews from the local airports wherever you are in the country i'm sure they they have the  same story of uh men and women gone the delays were crazy they searched my daughter they and meanwhile  you know it's it's it's a friggin uh uh a little white kid not it wasn't like no reason no no i mean 
[01:16:00]  they're searching oh yeah they're searching like a little white kid i'm sorry you're right and a  grandma and they just would just stop already the only answer is fucking body scanners for everybody  and they say they don't pick everything up but they can make you know there's there's different  kinds there's a body scan that sees everything and then they air puffs we walk through that with a  poof it's like an eye test yeah and it tests you for chemicals real quick yes it takes no time to walk  through that what airport was i in newark has them i don't know they're random i was on mars uh total 
[01:16:30]  recall they have a great one you see right through the person every half the fucking passenger should  walk through that and for the extra people that you're not sure of you have a dog sniffing because  there's nothing that they're going to do because eventually i've said this for years they're going  to surgically implant stuff the night before eventually they're going to surgically implant  explosives into their stomach or put them up their assholes there's no other way  no why down nothing you don't have to put it up the asshole if you could just fucking do a  little surgery like you're saying so you get a dog to sniff that right put it under the 
[01:17:00]  fucking guy's ribs yeah yeah if these guys are willing to fucking die absolutely they have no  choice at this point they're they're lunatic fanatic and somebody i was i was watching the news uh last  night and someone said he goes you know this is this is a war against islamic fanaticism  it's not a war on terror it's not a war you know war on terror would be uh i don't know a bunch of 
[01:17:30]  stuff going on hey remember the old hijackings to go fly me to cuba oh that old gag okay that's like  terror and shit like that this is a war on uh islamic extremists period that's the only people doing this  stop already stop wasting time and resources checking fucking uh you know mr and mrs john q  public if i may say i think you gotta have everybody walk through though because like first of all 
[01:18:00]  nobody would have profiled a nigerian like you wouldn't have thought like a just a black guy to  search him oh nah i mean like if you were looking we would look more like arabic looking guys how about  the fact that uh he again was on the radar he was he was on the radar people knew about this  fucking guy his father his own father turned him in and again what why what and how many  fucking different kind of lists are there this will piss me off too all right god was he on the  no fly list no he was on the must watch list he was on the watch list but not the no fly list and 
[01:18:30]  then there's a separate watch list that isn't as big as the other watches it's bureaucratic  bullshit you're either on the no fly list or not this motherfucker should have been on the  no fly list they said he was on a list with 500 000 other people like i guess there's levels they  have to go to oh my god if you're just suspected uh and it's i don't i don't know what classifies  the list databases are very easy to set up on a computer it sounds like a lot of people but you  know something when you put your fucking name in there and punch it in and it says no fly then you 
[01:19:00]  know fly that's it if you're yeah if you're on any list that they should be pulling you aside and  really at least put your side and fucking yeah drill up search whatever your ass exactly  i might want that the problem with you need the fucking body scans because they'll just get a  chechnyan or a chechnyan muslim who looks white and it's like they'll get it through somehow they'll  find some guy that doesn't look like the profile they got everyone through a fucking body scanner so 
[01:19:30]  no matter who they get it gets picked up but somebody also said uh on the news last night  uh uh it's got to start before the airport it's got to you know the intelligence and everything  it can't just be at the fucking security checkpoint at the airport right this should have to start  sooner and you got to look into who these people are where they're coming from what they've been up  to shenanigans that's what they've been up to and this motherfucker uh could have easily brought  that plane down well like when jesse venturer when i said to him how would you stop terrorism he said 
[01:20:00]  good police work and my point to him which of course you know none of these 9-11 conspiracy  assholes heard when they were giving me hate mail in my email yes was what what you say good police  work but a lot of times when cops and the fbi try to do that privacy privacy advocacy groups say no  no that's an invasion that's a violation it's like what what you would say is good police work a lot  of people say no that's uh not giving them their constitutional rights or that's profiling so that all 
[01:20:30]  these attempts a good police work are fucking stopped by people saying that it's profiling  or it's inappropriate i still think the agencies won't work with each other like they should be  also and they they make it sound like everybody's one big happy fucking family there's no problems it  wasn't the obama administration has no idea how to even comment on this fucking thing the homeland  security bitch is a dummy she's fucking i don't know that wasn't everything worked the way it was  supposed to really there was a guy in a plane with exploding underwear it didn't work well 
[01:21:00]  wasn't he allowed on without a fucking passport that's another thing yeah because uh he was  supposedly they thought he was from the sudan or or somewhere those poor people that don't have  passports and shit like that and you don't fly to the us then yeah stay away stay away there you go  not welcome not welcome uh is it true he had no passport yeah that's what jimmy was just saying yeah  that was what i heard but again that might have been false i was trying to try to verify that and  some guy get like vouched for him that he did have one yeah okay no some guy vouched for someone he 
[01:21:30]  was from sudan and he was too poor to have a passport someone was pleading his case yeah to get on that  plane i heard someone in a suit yep and there's some guy this is m.com which i don't know why that's  popular whatever it's called m something one of the passengers is saying that there was somebody else  arrested and that's being covered up yeah yeah it's being covered up you don't know why m.com is  popular i know nothing about m.com no it's short for marmalade marmalade well of course 
[01:22:00]  they're always on top of it yeah this is uh something where um you know even the political correct  assholes are gonna have to realize look there's a certain type of person doing this and even though  this guy was from uh nigeria uh it it they're ex muslim extremists and uh is it yeah we we gotta 
[01:22:30]  figure out how to fucking is it true it was a one-way ticket that he paid with cash really less  than a week or something they said most of them buy it less than two weeks before they go these  tourists are really stupid oh and he had like no why would you why would you do any carry-on or something  why would you do a one-way ticket if you know you're pretty much gonna die and money doesn't really  mean anything at that point why the one-way ticket i've never understood that only gives you a one-way  ticket your yemen fucking sponsor that uh paid for the red flag though isn't it and paying in cash 
[01:23:00]  cash for an airline ticket these days dude the last time i paid this let me tell you the last time i  paid cash for a uh a ticket and i'm gonna date myself right now does anyone remember uh people's  airline oh did you ever fly people's in did you buy smoking or non-smoking that's how long ago it  was oh no kidding smoking or non-smoking people's airline when i was going to school in western new  york they had a deal i forgot i swear to you i think it was less than twenty dollars to fly from new 
[01:23:30]  york to like buffalo or roger on this people's people's airline you paid on the plane yeah it was  like a bus or a train they rolled that's right down the aisle it was a cashier yeah you didn't  even have to pay until you got on the plane can you imagine and they would go from row to row does  anyone remember this yeah is this a dream i had or did i really live uh this sometimes i wonder that  it was like it was the same dream as when you were going to go be friends with obama that's my 
[01:24:00]  favorite moment that was such a child's dream me and the president were friends i blew it too and i  was so fucking needy you're gonna call right you're gonna call right you're gonna call me  i'm gonna call you fucking weirdo i just blew it that is such a little child but it was really funny  people's airline if someone has info on that i'm telling you i think it's just called people's  air or okay people's there did you ever fly it in people's there fuck no why petrified of that 
[01:24:30]  you were poor one time yeah i know i didn't go anywhere you don't worry about your safety  i don't think i flew anywhere i used to put a steak knife in my uh sock and i would fucking uh  i would hitchhike to the airport i was for real that's what i did and then i would throw the knife  this was before security was you know obviously insane and i would throw the knife right in front  of the airport in the garbage and go inside really every fucking time because you don't know who the  fuck's gonna pick you up jeez for real i had a knife people express people express i don't remember it's 
[01:25:00]  been so long people express what info you got on people's express or people express oh my god  look at that 47 47 holy shit oh shit not much but i mean it only operated between certain times  that are probably accurate for you did it fly to to buffalo western new york it did okay yeah it had  to be that people express guy had no luggage too they're saying oh it was operated by braniff 
[01:25:30]  braniff really i flew that once to florida did you yep he had no luggage well again that's a foreign  uh foreign uh carrier but how are uh no but i mean he's good he's going all the way to detroit with  no fucking of course i'm just a foreign gate agent but how the fuck are we allowing these are all red  flags yeah they're trying to tell me the uh it's very tough to defend against look we've all seen  uh i don't want to say splitting underwear fuck we've all been to the airport do you really feel 
[01:26:00]  safe when you're going through security that's all i have to say that's all i have to say and i'm not  talking about all of you because a bunch of you are fans and some of you i do feel safe but there's  all there's a majority where i'm like what the hell is this about well the other day and uh well  yesterday in newark uh terminal c somebody got that's continental by the way got through uh got  through security went in the out you know that thing that says this is not an entrance you got to go 
[01:26:30]  through security and there's usually a person sitting there stationed to make sure people do not do  it's where the people come out once they've completed their flight they leave right and you're  not allowed to go in that way some guy walked through there right and i don't know what was the  person doing that was sitting in the chair fucking sleeping well she got her hair did and she was  taking a look at i just got my her did her did i was looking at my nails and uh the guy apparently  got through and then they there's this big search for them they review all the security tapes they 
[01:27:00]  can't find them so now they got an empty terminal c terminal c is giant all the planes that had boarded  had to get the fuck off and go back through security again you're sitting on the plane imagine that  and then they're like uh well sorry grab your shit and go back through security why the people  on the plane already they didn't know who the guy was they couldn't find him that guy's not on a  plane yet might have been oh you think he might have been able to get might have been i guess you're  right my question is this was that just a fucking uh drill i'll tell you why because they never 
[01:27:30]  found the guy with the security cameras in the airport everywhere how could they not have found the  guy how do they have a drill that fucks the airport for eight hours maybe because that's all that's  all it did was fuck the airport for eight hours well i i sure as shit hope some union cunt doesn't  fucking defend the shithead that was supposed to be great watching that fucking uh entrance and and  use some kind of psycho babble and just throws their ass out fired goodbye why why aren't you following 
[01:28:00]  the guy who walks through a security breach let them stop not my job they just have to sit there  i don't know what the fuck it is i you know all serious stuff but i want to know more about people  express and we got linda in great neck linda what do you got on this people express listen listen to this  one it we were leaving we had taken it from new york to bangor maine uh last minute you know trip we  wanted to take i don't remember why and uh then on the way back there was a snowstorm in maine so we 
[01:28:30]  had to go on the plane on the tarmac forget you know going from the airport to the plane we're  sitting on the front row my friends and i the snow's blowing on our skirts and our stock days and our  shoes and they're taking the money from us and the door's still open and snow's blowing into the plane  yes yes that's wonderful i'm sorry they're apologizing i'm sorry i'm sorry but they wouldn't 
[01:29:00]  close the damn door yeah and someone's saying they flew people express for 40 bucks at bill and  virgin oh thank you uh linda let me go to bill real fast just somebody pouring like windshield  washer fluid on the wings it was there you go she's right though no frills they didn't have a spot  in the actual de-icing isn't a frill yeah exactly that's not a luxury item the wings not falling off  extra when they come around taking your money it's like yeah icing or de-icing oh they didn't have a 
[01:29:30]  spot in the terminal it was like so no frills that you just kind of showed up at the airport like your  people express or i follow me there was a weird gate you went through you walked down a taxiway and  walked onto the plane they didn't have a gate uh bill in virginia bill oh bill yeah how you doing  guys hey i used to be stationed a poor mama and i had recently got married my mother or my wife used  to call her mother all the time so i made a deal with her if she didn't call her mother i'd send her 
[01:30:00]  home once a month it cost me forty dollars one way and it was cheaper for her to take that flight  than it was for her for me to pay the phone bill for her to talk to her damn mother now someone is  telling me they had a student uh uh fair or whatever because i couldn't afford forty dollars  to fly no i'm telling you it was a lot cheaper than forty dollars for me to go from new york to uh  buffalo or rochester they may have had a student fair but i'll tell you right they didn't have a  military fair because i remember very distinctly it was forty dollars and going back to uh just showing

[01:33:30]  what uh the boat go home with mope he needs that in the white house happy the sign is still here in  the new year it really is uh and now i mean we all we all thought he had weird lips to begin with  and now with the fucking white hair yeah he really looks like he's frozen mr freeze it's mr freeze oh  travis has the yemen clip this goes way back it's one minute that's fine this uh amazing the setup is 
[01:34:00]  this this this was after the bombing of uh coal uss coal it was right the coal the no i think this  had to be what this was pre-9-11 oh yeah get out of town i think i don't know wait 2000 yeah because  we didn't we were fired like no the show was off august 2002 so it was well over what is it almost a  year after that it's after 9-11 okay so we were discussing all the uh but this was all the bad nasty 
[01:34:30]  countries but in all fairness this was like shortly after 9-11 when not many people knew what the  fuck was going on anywhere there was certain countries that are are and still you know weren't  still are sponsoring terrorism and yemen's been one and i mentioned it in lewis lewis who does keep tabs  on what's going on in the world uh he just fucking um oh i don't know what's going on with the tv  screen okay i looked at imus i'm like why is he wearing oxygen but there's something wrong with 
[01:35:00]  lewis is on tv above there's lewis yeah look at him talking to the kid oh he's doing it's one of  those aruba commercials that he does i love the aruba commercials he's a pisser all right so i was i  was uh bashing uh yemen and he um made fun of me here we go i'm thinking uh yemen has to be devastated  why not yemen i'm thinking really just you were just unbelievable i'm thinking syria you blow my  mind i think uh iraq why not yemen why not yemen there'll be 20 people calling why not yemen we 
[01:35:30]  couldn't even refuel a goddamn ship in yemen because uh they they have a terrorist running around  there free free rain let's call it operation why not yemen why not yemen i could point to 20 countries  that i'd say we should bomb i am uh there we go lewis i think this is a great time to break out that 
[01:36:00]  old favorite of 45 the atomic bomb oh no no no no absolutely you you know i think a low yield tactical  nuclear device a low yield what is low yield low yield these days is exactly what we dropped on  hiroshima and nagasaki that's it just proves that anthony's always been crazy by the way why why not  yemen i'll say it again why not yemen we pulled our uh diplomats out of there closed the embassy down 
[01:36:30]  see yeah yeah man yeah man all right why don't we take another break rightio when we get back one  thing i would like to discuss if possible is no giant building opening up in uh dubai dubai i'm  obsessed with this fucking building yeah i want to go to do i actually want to go to dubai i want to  take a trip let's talk about you want to go to the top of that thing look down there's video of some  guy on the top he's at the top of the radio tower really and uh it's and then you obviously can't go  to the top this guy has is in the top like i think the top part it's like twice the size of the 
[01:37:00]  trade center it's twice it's twenty six hundred twenty six hundred feet this fucking the trade  center is zero floors well yeah now yes it's my apartment but back then i think the trade center  was like uh what was it like it was 110 stories this one is like 230 stories i think what look at  the we'll show you the dubai tower and there's a fucking video of a guy in the very very top portion  of the fucking radio tower american airlines plane right behind him ready to hit it's not one of those 
[01:37:30]  fake pictures oh that was a fake remember that guy yeah he showed up everywhere now i don't know  he got overtaken by the uh the looter from katrina and uh 230 stories i believe it look it up it's  called burj dubai b-u-r-j d-u-b-a-i wow holy shit look at it that's some kind of star wars uh building  it's fucking massive there's footage from a helicopter where they i was watching and like 
[01:38:00]  there's footage of the guy inside the thing but then there's separate footage of these people in  a helicopter taking a video of it it's a fucking it's beautiful why are we connecting uh buildings  by now probably because the wind resistance at the top from connecting them for real i don't know  connecting buildings and make them just these massive things that so it's a it's a city like  the future like the future said you know what i mean like whole blocks yeah that way you don't  have to walk outside and you could be upstairs right and still be walking around i think it's the wind 
[01:38:30]  obviously i think it's the wind at that height because when when the video it would make the  buildings stronger is what i'm saying if you connect all the buildings and then build on top of that  and then you can make these massive structures that are two three hundred you know stories high  dude that absolutely looks like something from star wars yeah but wait dude just just i didn't see  this one these guys in the elevator oh you guys gonna be working on there go to oh okay go do  me just just google real quick really big thing by uh top uh tallest building at top  well can we talk about it after the break because i i don't want to rush through this let's get it 
[01:39:00]  and then we'll uh we'll talk about it after the break and after my lovely sandwich where's my  sandwich i'm hungry i'm starving too i'm hungry too let's take a kiss let's take a break i don't  think three men just imagine that all small fucking six lips three awkward tongues no it would just be  like this as our lips touched because you'd have that space in the middle where the tongues had to  meet let's just do it yeah let's do it and just harp on everybody 
[01:39:30]  all right we did the security thing so all right we have so much  shit to do i don't even know we'll do the dubai thing and other things in a minute here stay there  a little later i want to tell you guys that i'm officially a hero i forgot to tell you this one  before the show a hero it's a big sandwich yes no 
[01:40:00]  wow that hurt let's go like that oh chip  i led uh 50 people to safety yesterday yes i did yes i did and i followed the poseidon adventure  rules wait you led 50 people to safety yes i did following poseidon adventure rules yeah  what did they do in the poseidon adventure old school they all fuck shelly winters in the face  and then climbed over her fat body well uh they come on man you're come on no there's a couple of 
[01:40:30]  things uh the ship was upside down i don't think it was upside down but there were two two uh yes  two groups two groups one one group went the wrong way that's right and you went the right way i went  the right way ah where could you possibly have saved i'm truly a hero today by the way i was  people on a sunday i was watching a movie at the smoked salmon theater all right right i've told you  about this artsy theater where they offer smoked salmon sandwiches and popcorn by the way if you 
[01:41:00]  want to go old school they do have the popcorn but they also uh serve uh smoked salmon sandwiches  oh that's wonderful an artsy movie called uh an education which by the way i didn't see the end of  because of the situation i was in a situation yesterday oh no it's amazing because i'm sitting in  in the theater and i swear to god a guy comes running in and says there's a fire and we all  have fire in a crowded movie theater yes you're not supposed not covered by uh the first amendment 
[01:41:30]  you're not allowed to say that right of course not but this guy said it and thank god he did i  guess unless there is a fire and you know what as soon as the guy yelled fire that's when i smelled  the smoke like yeah what the fuck there is a fire but i needed a guy to tell me so how did you lead  people out knowing that everyone could see the exit signs well there was an exit sign but no we started 
[01:42:00]  to uh leave the way we came in the back of the theater uh-huh and it was it was some bad smoke to be  honest with you i don't i i want to know what the fuck was the deal because there were no fire trucks  outside it wasn't that dramatic jesus but it was a pretty someone burnt some popcorn i think that's all  it was i think that's all it was but this fucking asshole yells fire so he should have probably said  a lot of smoke no fire it's it's it's under control the guy that worked there i don't even 
[01:42:30]  know because it was dark and then then all of a sudden you're in that group mentality and i'm like  fuck the group mentality let's get the fuck out of here fuck everybody else exactly but we all had  to leave as a group i'm like fuck the leaving as a group shit so we go to the front of the theater  exit sign and now we have a decision to make do we go down or do we go up everyone started going  down and i should have let those fuckers go down what why what happened i said down go i said and  this is why i'm a hero today my friend i said hey everybody and i didn't make this hey everybody 
[01:43:00]  announcement i said we went down to get to the theater we have to go up you dummies oh because  this is a theater that you actually go down from street level street level you go down and the hull  is thinnest by the propeller shaft that's right anthony besides adventure rules exactly so see you do  remember of course but everyone started going down i'm like why are you fucking going down you idiots  we got to go back up we got to go back up and then they just assume down is safe down is safe why 
[01:43:30]  would you assume down is safe that's down is to the ground right up is to the sky so then everyone  starts rushing upstairs because now we're in group mentality and there is smoke in the stairwell too  it was a pretty fucking smoky situation and then there's a fucking old lady that's holding everybody  up and now we're all like now we're all trying to figure out how much time do we give the old  lady before we trample her to death right there man got out of the way he runs through her but it was 
[01:44:00]  very interesting yesterday because everyone had patience but you could see their patience was like  yeah because no one really knew what the fuck was going on there was smoke in the stairwell and there  was a lot of smoke in the theater now why didn't you pull out your phone or something and start videoing  i want you know what and i'm videoing all the time i know and i fucking did it see that's those are the  moments i know and and especially with the old lady holding everyone up and she goes like i'm really 
[01:44:30]  sorry with her old lady voice get the fuck out and it was a small stairwell so you couldn't really  squeeze by anyone oh you watch and and she's like i'm oh i feel so bad that i'm holding everybody  why would she go like first and they're slowly helping her and i'm like i'm i'm seconds away from  trampling this old bitch to make sure me and my loved one are out of this theater and then i'll  and then i'll figure out the situation i'll go back for the old lady yeah but i'm not burning in a 
[01:45:00]  stairwell because you're slow exactly and you had your time on this earth i'm only halfway done  hopefully let her get fried by the flash fire that's not me but you start thinking you're like  how much time am i going to give this old lady before i have to make a move yep and then look like a  complete asshole when you find out that it was just a smoky popcorn making machine so did you finally  jump up and start turning the steam valve and cursing god there you go did you do that and 
[01:45:30]  and save the people beside adventure rules and knows and knows and i should have let those dummies  go you should have be the group of dummies that go the wrong way wow and then we were out and then  you never really figured out what the fire was though i'd have been uh we're out on the street  and there's no fucking fire trucks and then everyone rushes to the ticket booth to get their money back  and now everyone's pissed off that's weird too because you're in a situation where like  fuck am i gonna get out of this fucking theater alive it goes through your mind a little bit 
[01:46:00]  then you want your and now all of a sudden you go from thank god i'm alive to where the  fuck is my money give it back to me and then this lady in front of me as we're getting our money back  i'm like fuck i'll get my fucking what was it 20 bucks back what the hell right the lady in front  of me is arguing over a surcharge or a service charge or something and like sorry we can't give back  the service charge as well we could give you the money you know for the ticket and she's arguing  like how much is the fucking service charge because now the um the ticket windows outside 
[01:46:30]  it's one of these theaters outside so we're freezing our asses off move move out of our way you stupid  service charge lady why can't they give you the service charge back i don't know what the  fuck's the service charge but but the point is what is it a dollar 75 or something on a ticket  what how much could this the surcharge or the service charge be if there's a fire in the theater the  theater should take the hit not you guys i'll never go back to a movie theater again 
[01:47:00]  but you know what maybe maybe it's uh uh maybe it's a topic for conversation today on the show i'm  sure people have been in that situation where you're sitting there like i was pissed that i was in the  group mentality thing i'm like why do we have to do this as a group fuck that it should be every  man for themselves nope and then how much patience do you have before you make a dumb move where you  look like you might look like an asshole when you're all out on the sidewalk judge  judge coming through that was great she's like i'm sorry i'm holding everybody up and she is taking 
[01:47:30]  these stairs so fucking slow and and the smoke is getting a little i'm not gonna over exaggerate here  but there were like i said they were smoking the stairwell and it was getting a little little  more as the time was going by yeah yeah you know when do you make that move and you push the old lady  aside immediately you would you immediately do it yes i'm talking immediately and by the way i'm not  waiting to to to burn i i was never like panicked i figured it was you know but there were people that 
[01:48:00]  were panicking they really were oh my goodness all right okay this is just a gig it's not my life  i don't know what was it was what is he a clown is he a club what are you everybody  or what is he i think i smell some smoke back here all right so what's the big deal  what's that the audio is all yeah there were two 
[01:48:30]  blind sides that old bag it's funny but i really was kind of in that situation yesterday it was an  old lady that was in front of us why is she first yeah exactly she lived her fucking life that's like  when shelly winters had to crawl into the thing and the uh the hooker lady went you know i'm not  getting stuck behind this fat ass side adventure i'm going first by the way why is it at an airport  people in wheelchairs have to be pushed ahead of you uh online they always bring them to the front 
[01:49:00]  of the security line why i don't like that there's no reason that you can't wait like the rest you're  in a fucking wheelchair and there's no reason you can't wait you're in the best position you  already have a seat exactly the rest of us are standing i can see boarding the plane  first i'm not even i'm not even making jokes i'm laughing because that makes perfect sense  why would you have to be the first to board an airplane you're comfortable the plane i can  understand because they have to bring the chairs off it's a pain in the ass i'm talking about the  security line to get to why they have to wheel and cut everybody yeah right stop i don't even 
[01:49:30]  like that they board the plane first tell you the truth now to me it's easier once a bunch of  people on the plane last so anthony you go last i don't mind them doing that i say this today i  know ronnie b's a hero but you want you know what i'm also on that list apparently so and and i was  the one that said we have to go up and you know what aunt people were thanking me on the sidewalk  were they they sure were they served smoked salmon there smoked salmon so maybe it was the smoked 
[01:50:00]  salmon it's got smoke in the name and you know what i do have a heart because you asked why i didn't  videotape there was a panic in the stairwell i'm like i know we're fine but if i pull my luggage  like very now people can be like what the fuck is wrong with you i pull out a camera i really  should anything happen i should have i really should have yeah i'm kind of mad i don't have  that footage especially with the old lady going i'm sorry i'm holding everyone up i can't believe 
[01:50:30]  you're all waiting for me move your wrinkled ass out of the way i am i'm not burning for anybody  it's creepy being in a stairwell though yeah one of those and and it was a stairwell that went up  like it was how how do i explain this it was you know between floors was a lot of fucking oh yeah  a lot of stairs a lot of whacking whacking a lot of walking all right enough of that uh jimmy  wanted to talk about the big building it just um we were talking i'm by the way it's it's i was wrong 
[01:51:00]  about the 234 it's 169 floors but it's it's so much i think it's 2684 feet that's what the radio  part of it but uh they have a comparison next to the willis building which is the sears tower  this what you're talking about  this thing dwarfs anything else yeah any other building it dwarfs any other building and there's a  video where's uh anybody can wait the computer it looks like a building that goes into the clouds 
[01:51:30]  because it does oh yeah and uh you know you can't you can't quite see the top of it because of the  haze it's uh every every futuristic space movie uh building the footage of the guy at the top  in the fucking top of the radio tower yeah is chilling it really is anthony said it looks like  just scared i wouldn't do it because he said it sways the audio only works on it for like the first  minute but you it the the tower sways a little bit because it's so high up and he's in the very 
[01:52:00]  very tip top he's as high as you can go he's where the lights are wow and it's horrifying footage i want  to go there it's a hotel in there too there's a high-end hotel let's get a gig what do they do  on the upper floors what's that what do they do on the upper floors they have uh i'm sure they have  they have apartments they have uh luxury penthouses and stuff like that yeah for all those rich  i looked at apartments that were that high it's creepy 150 stories well i looked at it i looked  at a an apartment in your building that was like on one of the top floors it was creepy being 
[01:52:30]  i'm pretty high but it was like 50 stories up i'd love stories up is pretty creepy man i love being  that high i'm up there but 50 looked weird they said in this building some palestinian guy paid  uh some businessman paid three million dollars for a one-bedroom on the 80th floor oh that's  and real estate has dropped a lot so he's probably taking a fucking beating you think yeah  dubai is a good place to go right now because they're in financial troubles they probably have  good deals oh good deals yeah look i'm i'm a 25 foot off the ground kind of guy that's that's 
[01:53:00]  where i like to sleep 25 feet off the ground second floor that's all oh listen just what if you live  in a ranch house and he's just sleeping on the roof and your math skills suck why you're not 25 feet  off the floor on the second floor i think i am out of your house you're like 12 or 13 feet  let me think your ceiling would be maybe 25 feet on the second um sleeping on the ceiling  what i know let's see eight ten you're probably no more than you do have high ceilings though you're 
[01:53:30]  probably 15 feet yeah yeah those ceilings are pretty high anything yeah you're probably right i thought it  was like 25 that's if you're on the roof god now i'm scared people could climb right up there  uh yeah that building is insane but it dwarfs everything that came before it it's  fucking 165 169 serviceable floors wow so that's 1600 that's probably 1700 feet and the rest might be um 
[01:54:00]  and the towers were 110 110 this is 70 stories higher than the tower and i think with the radio antenna they  might have been 1500 feet i'm not sure 1200 feet this one is uh that's ridiculous  fucking 2600 feet look at the helicopter footage it's amazing up there after you jerk off  you splooge off the roof i bet you are just rocking back and forth too yeah like i bet that thing moves 
[01:54:30]  pretty far i want to know how it's the highest floor for the hotel there's a big there's like roof  there's like a rooftop uh i'm sure pool somewhere up there it's gotta be a great hotel just sloshing  around with waves in it buildings moving back and forth i don't know yeah i mean not much conversation  there but but i want i want i would have to segue at one point into the new travolta movie what brought  to you by the director of taken oh no i didn't see this stunk taken was terrible yeah but there's a 
[01:55:00]  lot of people that liked it oh i don't care if everyone liked it but me i mean there are movies  out there that everyone could agree sucked that taken there's they're still arguing that one jimmy  that's okay they really are i'm right and they're wrong it's stuck they really are still arguing it  what travolta movie yeah what look at the new whatever the new one is there's only like one  line or something but it's so hacky that's that's the view from the top of this fucking building in 
[01:55:30]  dubai go to yeah the top of uh burj b-u-r-j dubai tower can you play from the beginning because the  guy the guy there's only audio for a minute oh yeah okay well now the top of the bus goodbye  this is the highest point in the world it's a very small little circled area he's in  nothing around me all we can do is look down i just got that feeling looking at look at  his wobbles dreadfully so if my hands are shaking it's not just me 
[01:56:00]  standing in the oh my god  if if you took the building away that looks like about a minute into a space launch yeah  let those cameras that look down at the earth look at these guys they're showing these like  window washers or whatever they're probably fucking uh i wouldn't wash over two thousand  feet in the air i'd let the windows get dirty yeah who's gonna tell come on 
[01:56:30]  i would just make believe i did my job is that fucking chilling that view yeah i cleaned all the  windows on the 160 story you go up there and check to see if i did it dude the area he's in  is probably the size of a large barrel a little crow's nest yeah and it's where the lights are to  warn planes sure it's the very top of the radio tower it's so wow shadow that thing cast oh  i want to know how do you get up like i want to know like what happened to the top floor 
[01:57:00]  what what goes above that like how do you get to the top of the radio tower is there a ladder  or an internal ladder how do you get up to climb up that thing  would you parachute off there no i wouldn't parachute anywhere crazy person my hands are sweating  looking at this i know it's very frightening yeah yeah i got that fucking weird feeling when  i saw that video when he was looking over the side i twitter can i tell you how funny somebody  somebody is on twitter i twittered something about how i want to uh i want to stand on the top of  this building and and preach loudly about felching and somebody and somebody wrote uh some funny guy 
[01:57:30]  wrote i want to lay next to it with a hard-on and compare  come up short  can i share with you guys uh my tweet of the day from yesterday yes speaking of uh hard-ons is it from  being a hero no i'm done with the hero thing oh i lived uh i lived like a hero yesterday and though  i certainly did and nothing in the paper about a fire in a movie theater no i i didn't i that i'm 
[01:58:00]  telling you i didn't i didn't over exaggerate i told you when i got outside there were no fire trucks  in the end it was no big fucking deal i'm pissed off at the guy that ran in in a fucking panic  because i even i even told my girl i'm like i should have went out into the lobby and assessed the  situation because why am i trusting this dummy's fucking opinion on what's going on for real  because i mean everyone was in a panic in the stairwell and shit and it turns out it was probably  some popcorn machine that was just uh you know got smoked out how deep in the movie 
[01:58:30]  fucking when the whole plot was being revealed and now you you haven't seen it was an artsy film  so whatever so who cares no i went on and and and read what happened oh you did i went to a spoiler  site and said all right now i finally need a spoiler site was it to parish with love it was  called the education or from parish or something i don't know education it's an education uh  fuck there was something oh my tweet of the day can you go here  danny probably already knows about that can you play for these guys

I like that.  Very funny.  Want to take a break?  Yeah, I got a tingle. 
[02:03:00]  Pee-pee time.  Did our food get here?  Oh, yeah.  That's how I do it.  What?  I just got the only line on the Travolta Cliff.  It was so fucking corny and awful.  Do you have it?  Do we have it?  I don't know how it'll play on the radio.  It's on the fucking, on TV.  I saw it yesterday.  It was, he's bald now.  And he plays like a renegade.  It fucking stinks.  A renegade.  Did you see you made the trailer for fucking fuzzy?  Oh, Furry Vengeance.  Furry Vengeance, whatever.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, I understand that, you know, they're killing it on Whack Bag, which is fine. 
[02:03:30]  I understand why they're not going to like the movie.  But they're like, some of these fans, I don't mind getting shit on and teased.  But some of you who try to figure it out are just douchebags.  Is he really good enough?  You can't trash other movies.  Look, I'm going to continue to trash The Pink Panther and Steve Martin.  This is a kid's movie.  Now, I'm not saying I would go see it.  Don't even explain yourself.  No, I'm going to.  It's about...  But those guys are in a place that... 
[02:04:00]  I looked at the script and I realized when they said that there was going to be a squirrel  driving, squirrel driving.  If this was not exactly the type of comedy I would have written, but it's a child's movie.  Squirrel driving, okay.  But I went...  It's funny.  I went for the audition.  I had the worst audition I ever had.  It was that Meryl Streep, Alec Baller movie that's out now.  The worst audition I ever had.  And then my manager goes, look, they're doing an audition for this... 
[02:04:30]  For Avengers.  Do you want to do it?  And I said, no.  I didn't want to do it because I had gone to that place already and I was terrible.  And he goes, look.  He goes, I think Patrice did an audition and they like him a lot and the casting director  is a fan.  She loves you.  And look, Brooke Shields in a Brendan...  Do you want to...  I'm like, yeah, all right.  I guess I'll go.  And I gave a bad audition.  What I thought was a bad audition.  And I even fucking...  I gave a say now message.  I really did.  And I left a say now message about how you suck.  I can't act.  And the scene was actually pretty cool between me and Patrice, which actually I think they wound up  not shooting.  And I got it. 
[02:05:00]  So I don't mind being teased for it, but don't get carried away.  Slow down.  Some of them are just fucking...  I don't mind.  It's the fucking ones that are like, and Jimmy always does it.  It's like, stop your obsession.  Do you want to suck my big dick?  Is that what you guys want?  Probably it.  A couple of you, do you really want that?  Probably it, Jimmy.  Do you want to suck it?  Is that what you want?  You fucking obsessed little bitch.  Is that what you want to do?  You want to pop it in your mouth and fucking service me?  Ha, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  It's not the kind of comedy I would go see. 
[02:05:30]  We should have played Guess the Sound.  Fuck.  We should have played Guess the Sound.  That was a good one.  Yeah, I did make the trailer.  I'm very happy.  Yeah.  Honestly, it wasn't bad.  It ends the trailer.  It wasn't bad.  I don't feel bad about it.  I was excited to see.  I'm like, holy shit.  That's fucking cool.  Jim Norton's in a trailer for a movie that's obviously going to do very well.  Maybe not with our demo, but it's going to do very well out there.  It's not meant for fucking 35-year-old fucking white guys, which is my target demo. 
[02:06:00]  We're not going for the same group of people.  And another movie that you're in the final cut, Cop Out, it's now called.  It used to be called, what, Two Dicks?  A couple of dicks.  But he had to change that because they wouldn't have showed that.  The Kevin Smith movie?  Yeah.  That fucking trailer looked great.  Yeah, I saw it once.  A lot of funny lines in that trailer.  Pat Van Norton says, I'm in a trailer.  And true, he is.  Yeah, wow.  Poor Pat.  Well, Jimmy always does that. 
[02:06:30]  Does he?  How do you know?  Why do you go there, then?  Because they know Jimmy.  It's just odd.  I don't understand.  But don't go there anymore until they figure their shit out.  They really need to figure their shit out.  Most of them are cool.  Yeah, well, that's the point I made, but they forgot about that.  Yeah, most of them are cool, but they got to figure their shit out.  And I don't mind, like I said, I don't mind getting fucking teased.  I don't mind, you know, because I deserve it.  I talk a lot of shit.  But it's the ones who think they're in the know.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  You're not in the know.  Someone let me know when they figure their shit out, and fuck, I'll be there.  I'll be there for them.  Because there are, most of them are cool.  Yeah, and they were very supportive of the radio show.  Most of them are cool.  But they got to figure their shit out.  That's what you got to do with message boards and radio shows.  From time to time, you got to figure your shit out.  And adjust.  I got to see this from Paris with love.  From the guy who brought you Taken, which isn't a surprise.  No.  Yeah.  I just got to see what this is all about.  Is it the whole trailer here?  It's not that long, I don't think. 
[02:07:30]  A lot of shooting.  I'm moving pretty quick.  From Paris with love.  Yeah.  I'm a man short, Reese.  I need your help.  Sir, you do realize that I am not special off certified.  We've got you working with our company, Charlie Wax.  Charlie Wax.  Besides, it's mostly driving wax around.  Go closer.  Close up.  Nail this job, and consider yourself a member of the club.  I don't know.  Lion's Gate.  Lion's Gate.  This is time. 
[02:08:00]  Travolta shooting and running.  Yeah.  My friends are all over that car.  You want to stop in the middle of our getaway so you can wipe your friends and grab some files.  I'll be quiet.  Quicker than this.  Yeah.  Action packed.  What the?  Work for you?  I'm the director of Taken and the producer of The Transporter.  Sir, Wax's methods aren't exactly regulation.  Let's order off the menu. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, damn.  Travolta.  About a billion.  John Travolta.  Jonathan Rees-Meyers.  Who the hell is he?  This crazy partner they got me working.  Ah!  Tell me that wasn't so impressive.  This looks dreadful.  Welcome to Paris, baby.  This time from Paris with love.  That's what he said to that guy when he kissed him on the fucking steps. 
[02:09:00]  Of the airplane.  Only you knew, Caroline.  All right, look.  Someone has to say it.  It's about time we all admit that Pulp Fiction was a fucking fluke.  It was a fluke.  It was a fucking fluke.  Travolta.  Tell me one movie he's done since then that was worthy of seeing.  Not a one.  People will say, like, people will say that stupid one where it was the fucking angel or  some shit.  Well, look who's talking, which might have been before that.  It was before. 
[02:09:30]  That was before it.  It stunk.  That was the start of his comeback and then Pulp Fiction and then what?  For real.  And then what?  Future review from Papamonaki.  This movie is Travolting.  Someone will use that.  Well, you know when you search on the IMDb for a celebrity, it'll give you, like, their  most known work next to their name to confirm, is this the guy you're looking for?  Yeah.  And for Travolta, it is Pulp Fiction when you go to search.  Was it 94?  That was 94.  Which was a fluke. 
[02:10:00]  It was a fluke.  Absolute fluke.  He happened to hit everything right.  Quentin Tarantino knew he was making a comeback, so he actually listened, I guess.  Oh, where's Pulp Fiction now?  Oh, my God.  It's way down there now, right?  Oh, my God.  That's already 16 years ago.  Michael's the one that people go, oh, or Phenomenon.  Get Shorty.  No.  Face Off.  Phenomenon.  Face Off you even say no to? 
[02:10:30]  No.  I'll watch it, but he's just terrible.  Wow.  And then it just gets, just, there's nothing.  There really is nothing that is a standout since Pulp Fiction.  Welcome back, Cotter.  Grease.  And Saturday Night Fever.  Stayin' Alive.  Stayin' Alive, where he played a Broadway musical dancer guy.  There's not one movie, though, we'd all agree was another, like, standout performance.  What about Wild Hogs?  Go ahead.  Shit on my career. 
[02:11:00]  Old Dogs.  Old, oh, that, just stop.  That came and went, huh?  Fucking Avatar up to a billion dollars made.  Holy shit.  Yeah, I'm a motherfucker.  Have you seen The Avatar?  No.  It's not a movie I'm like, oh, I gotta see this.  You'll see it eventually.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Know what movie I saw?  And what the fuck was wrong with our screener copies?  Jimmy mentioned this.  What?  That fucking Heath Ledger thing.  All right.  I like it.  Don't fucking blow it for me. 
[02:11:30]  I saw half the goddamn fucking movie.  And my screener copy fucked up again.  Did it freeze?  Yeah.  No.  It just went, no, it went, yeah, it just froze.  You get past that, and then what happens is, I think they were scared we were gonna sell  it to the Asians or something.  It freezes, the second half of the movie, it freezes, like, every ten minutes for five  seconds.  And you wait out the five seconds, and then it pops back on.  Are you shitting me?  And I'm like, what are they worried about?  That we're gonna fucking, like, start duping copies? 
[02:12:00]  Maybe it was just burned badly.  Huh?  Maybe it was just burned badly.  So it freezes.  It freezes when it's starting to get really good, right?  Yeah.  I got past that.  I forgot what I did, but I either waited it out, or I kind of, like, did a fast-forward  thing, and I finally got out of that fucking cycle.  And then the rest of the movie, every ten minutes, or every seven to eight minutes,  it would freeze for five seconds.  It got to a point where I started counting, and go, one, two, three, four, five.  So they did it on purpose.  So we had a fucked-up copy. 
[02:12:30]  It's good, though, right?  It was good.  I liked it.  Yeah.  That's where we had Terry Gilliam in front of us.  I'm so fucking bummed Heath Ledger died, because it got a little fucked up, because they  had to bring in everybody else to finish the movie, and they made it kind of make sense.  I don't want to blow it for anything.  Well, Terry Gilliam kind of said what happened.  Yeah, yeah.  Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell.  Colin Farrell, and who was the other guy?  Jude Law.  And Jude Law.  And, but, you start thinking, man, if Heath Ledger was able to play this all the way to 
[02:13:00]  the end, he had a fucking hit on his hands.  No one really is seeing this movie, unfortunately.  Visually, it's great.  I thought it was really interesting.  Yeah, it looks really cool.  It looks really cool.  But that little fucking fidget guy?  Yeah.  He's a horrendous actor.  Vern Troy?  Isn't that?  That's Vern Troy.  That's a fucking, yeah.  He's a little horrible.  He's pissed himself in his, I mean, he's doing lines with Heath Ledger, and I'm like,  oh, brother.  Oh, man.  Who else was in that was, Tom Waits was very good in that.  Tom Waits ruled in that movie.  He plays the devil. 
[02:13:30]  Did you see the whole thing, Jimmy?  Yes.  You finally saw the whole thing?  I did, yeah.  Tom Waits is amazing.  Yeah, I gots to see the riff of that.  No, Ed, you got a copy that'll work.  Yeah, I'll pop it in there.  If you get past that part, that was a little complicated.  They were trying to throw me off there.  Yeah.  But I got past that, and then, like I said, you gotta, then you don't have to do anything.  You just have to wait as it freezes for five seconds and then pops back on.  I'm an asshole.  How much has it made?  It didn't, unfortunately, it didn't do well.  I really liked it. 
[02:14:00]  I definitely liked it.  Can we see what it made, Dan?  Is there a way to check where it's at in...  You know what else I saw over the break?  The latest Harry Potter movie?  I know it's a little old now.  Harry Potter?  Because I was kind of into that Harry Potter thing.  That last movie where Dumbledore is killed by a fucking snake or whatever, snakes?  Yeah, snake.  That movie fucking sucked.  I never saw any of the Harry Potter's...  There was no wizardry.  You watch Harry Potter for wizardry.  Where's the wizardry?  There was a lot less wizardry. 
[02:14:30]  Really?  I hated it.  I never saw any of them.  And I didn't mind the Harry Potter movies.  I saw a couple of them.  I never saw Lord of the Rings either.  I never seen those fantasy movies.  Lord of the Rings?  Lord of the Rings.  What's wrong with you, James?  It's not my style.  Fantasy shit does nothing for me.  Dude, Lord of the Rings.  That's pretty accurate.  You got a good system at home?  Oh, yeah.  Crank up your good system and sit down and watch the trilogy.  It's action-packed.  That fucking movie is amazing.  What's it about?  Bunch of guys is selling rings?  Lord of the Rings is...  I can't believe you haven't seen it yet.  It stinks. 
[02:15:00]  How good is Lord of the Rings?  It's fucking great.  I love the whole thing.  You watch the trilogy.  It takes forever.  It's fantastic.  You should sit through it.  It's an amazing series.  I believe on my 16th viewing of the new Star Trek, though.  I cannot watch that enough.  Should I watch it?  I'm obsessed with that fucking movie.  It's on demand, and I keep blowing past it.  It's fucking great.  All right.  I got to sit through it.  Oh, my God.  And you don't have to be a Star Trek...  Only four?  What?  Is that good or bad, though? 
[02:15:30]  It's only four screens.  Why is it only...  Why is it only on four screens?  350,000?  Dr. Parnassus movie or whatever?  It's only made 300...  That movie's worth more than 350,000 made.  I'm telling you.  Well, it's only got fucking four screens, though.  Limited release.  That's really limited.  Four screens.  Why?  Maybe they're holding off until Avatar blows over.  Maybe they planned on releasing it on more, but Avatar's killing, so they're holding it?  I don't know.  Dude, if I would have gotten a good copy, they could have said five screens.  Right. 
[02:16:00]  Jesus Christ.  That movie should do way better than that.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Heath Ledger dying really fucked it up, huh?  Yeah, perhaps.  All right.  And Star Trek's good?  I got a...  Oh, it's great.  The last one, it's on...  Yeah.  I'm not a Trekkie, though.  I mean...  I'm not.  You really don't have to be.  It's pretty cool.  If you are, then the inside...  Is it even better?  ...jokes and stuff are pretty cool, funny shit.  The effects are great.  The story's good.  Fucking good movie. 
[02:16:30]  Ant ruined it for me, though, because when you started doing Spock and his dentures, I can't  not think of that.  Spock talking over his dentures.  James T. Kirk.  What?  I am Spock.  Spock.  His dentures, his big Spock dentures.  Dude, that may...  Talk over.  I can't not laugh at Spock's dentures.  I know.  He just can't talk with them in his mouth.  You see Sherlock Holmes?  No, I hear...  It's good. 
[02:17:00]  It's homoerotic.  What?  That's what I said.  Good.  Dude.  Is it really?  Dude Law's character, I guess, Watson?  Yeah.  And Sherlock?  What the fuck is going on there?  Do they imply that maybe there was a little love interest between the two homos?  I don't know.  Sherlock Homo?  It was homoerotic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something was going on.  There was some kind of love thing between those two.  Well, they're partners in crime there.  Well, they didn't act it out like that fucking Brokeback Mountain thing, but... 
[02:17:30]  No spitting on the hand?  They're letting her loose?  There was something going on.  There was a jealousy and a...  I don't know what the fuck that movie was about.  Oh, we're being asked here, was there a docking?  Was Sherlock...  There was a docking scene.  A docking scene?  I went and got popcorn, but there was a docking scene.  Oh, okay.  That's a little...  That's from Sherlock Holmes.  I'll see that.  What is that?  He's tied up to his bed pose.  He's well built.  Jesus Christ.  And he's got a pillow covering his cock.  But that's where the key is.  We've seen... 
[02:18:00]  We all saw that in the fucking preview.  That fucking Robert Downey...  What a comeback that guy...  Dude, he's a great...  How many comebacks does that fucking guy have in him?  He's a great actor.  He's amazing in Sherlock Holmes.  The homoerotic angle was a little weird.  But in the movie theater, they showed the trailer for Iron Man 2?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  What's good?  Mickey fucking Rourke is in it.  Oh, really?  Giving him a little extra...  Looking like a badass.  But they gave away the whole fucking movie.  Of course they did.  I'm done with trailers. 
[02:18:30]  I hate when they do that.  I gotta get that app where they tell you exactly when the movie starts.  I'm done with trailers.  They give away the entire movie now.  Yeah, I...  So fucking done.  Does it have to tell you when the movie starts?  How much trailers are shown?  You know Iron Man 2?  You know the whole plot of the movie?  You know that Mickey Rourke makes an appearance and he's gonna be...  You don't have to do that, dude.  Why do they...  You don't have to fucking show the whole movie.  On pay-per-view at home, right?  Yeah.  Or on demand.  Right.  They have the option to look at the trailer.  Right.  And sometimes I wanna know a little bit of what's going on. 
[02:19:00]  Well, if it's a movie you've never heard of, you're like, alright, I gotta watch the trailer  to see if I even wanna sit through this shit.  So I'll sit and watch the trailer right up until I go, looks good to me, boom, shut  that fucker off and start watching the movie.  Like, but if you...  Iron Man 2, the trailer was in sequence.  You don't have to show it in sequence.  Just throw a few fucking whacked out scenes together.  You know, and don't make a story in the trailer.  The worst thing they ever do in trailers, and they do it all the time, is when a good  guy turns into a bad guy, and they show it in the trailer. 
[02:19:30]  Right.  So that at the beginning of the movie, you're watching it going, I know he turns into a  bad guy, so...  I get so mad.  You wreck the fucking movie.  I used to love seeing the trailers before the, you know, the feature.  Not anymore.  It's not worth it.  It's not worth it.  Hmm?  Huh?  Do they show Iron Man dying?  Hmm?  Iron Man can't die.  He's on Iron Man.  Oh, yes he can.  But he doesn't.  They need more sequels.  Yeah.  Maybe they'll do a prequel.  Does he die in this? 
[02:20:00]  Does he die in this?  Oh, that's a spoiler.  How do you know he dies?  Because I know people in the business.  You don't know anyone in the business.  I do.  I have show biz friends, I call them.  Prove it.  Prove, you know, people in the biz.  The biz.  Well, perhaps my furry vengeance connections are being forgotten.  Oh.  Oh.  Are you in that movie a lot?  I don't know, actually.  We had a good amount of lines.  I don't know.  I missed one day of shooting, too, because I was doing a gig. 
[02:20:30]  So I just don't know.  Oh, that was smart.  Well, you know, I'll tell you why.  We had preplanned that for a while.  Either play the chuckle hut or get more lines in a movie.  That's going to be huge.  Well, they weren't supposed to shoot that day with our characters.  It probably would have been a couple.  I'm just fucking with you, Jimmy.  You know that.  All right.  Enough about movies.  Yes, that's our movie break.  Any other movies you see over the break?  Oh, God.  Harry Potter's movie, which is old.  Sucked.  I'm trying to think, because I sat in a hotel, and it's still in theaters.  Oh, I want to know about the hotel. 
[02:21:00]  Still in theaters.  Let me think.  Oh, I watched The Hangover.  How was it?  You never saw The Hangover?  You know what?  It's all right.  It got like this, wow, it's the best movie ever, but Tanny kept making fun of it.  Keith was getting all mad.  Is it overrated?  It's like, it's sexual, because Keith was like, oh, I'll do The Hangover.  Oh, watch this part.  Watch this part.  And the parts kept coming, and I'm just like, that wasn't that great.  Maybe he's talking about the next part.  Yeah.  And the part just never comes.  And then I walk in, and then I go, oh, The Hangover, and then he goes, yeah, these guys 
[02:21:30]  are just wild.  It's crazy.  Out of control.  These guys are Vegas.  Oh, this is crazy.  This guy's in Vegas.  And I knew.  Throwing mattresses out the window.  I knew in a second what Danny meant as I'm watching it.  I'm like, that's exactly it.  Wow, they're crazy.  You know that The Hangover made a lot of lists as the most overrated movie of the year.  Yeah, yeah.  Most overrated movie of the decade.  It really was.  It definitely has to be.  I mean, I liked it.  I don't think it was a bad movie.  It was fun. 
[02:22:00]  It was.  It was fun.  I mean, I had a couple of laughs here and there and stuff, but it wasn't like.  It didn't live up to what my mind had made it to be at that point.  If they didn't.  It was no super bad.  If they didn't end the movie with all the pictures, that movie, that brought the whole  fucking movie together.  Yeah, but.  I think that movie was in trouble without that ending.  At that point, he was like.  And how great was Mike Tyson as an actor?  Oh, yeah.  Tyson.  It was funny when he punched the guy.  I mean.  You weren't into it?  No.  What about the small dick guy? 
[02:22:30]  We had him in.  Now you know who we're talking about.  I know, but that whole character was a little weird over the top.  Like I said, I laughed a couple of times and shit.  Where'd you laugh at?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Anyway.  Stuff with the little, like the baby was kind of funny.  I don't remember anymore.  He was wearing the baby.  Oh, like when the baby was.  When he was making the baby jerk off.  All right.  He's holding the baby's hand.  He goes, hey, check this out.  Like that was funny because it was just so fucking twisted.  But you know, it's a chuckle and then you move on. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's not any wild fucking, holy shit, I got to see what happens next.  And maybe you had maybe four or five of those kinds of chuckle.  Right, right.  And then the movie's over.  Then that's it.  All right.  Heather Graham's looking beat up, huh?  Wow.  What?  You know, I like Heather Graham a lot.  They don't have to always use that natural lighting.  But geez, man.  They were using that bright, you know, fucking Vegas sun.  They should have probably filmed a few of those scenes indoors with her.  Yeah.  She looked a little beat up, right? 
[02:23:30]  I know.  A little long in the tooth, I dare say.  But hey, there's always Roller Girl.  You could always pop in Boogie Nights and fucking spank away.  Why does Alan Alda insist on doing Picks 11?  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Why won't he go?  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, look at Alan.  What a great suit he has, though.  He's a fucking classy guy.  He's doing the comb forward.  You should never do the comb.  He's doing the comb forward.  Just let it go.  Not even the comb over.  Let it go.  Oh, I do a little bit of a... 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I'm doing a little of a comb over.  No, he's got like the...  I do a slight comb over.  Look at the sides.  Those should be either gone or down or up.  I don't know.  He looks good, though.  He looks like Alan Alda with like...  Look, he's doing Jimmy.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Look, look, look.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  What, we can't punch up audio?  I'd love to hear him right there.  Kelly?  See what he's saying.  I don't know.  It's directed by the same guy who helmed the Dark Knight.  Oh, he sounds different.  You know, it's going to be a big event movie.  People online are already buzzing about this trip. 
[02:24:30]  Inception.  Oh, what's...  Leonardo...  Put on the Obama...  All right.  You know, that's...  That's a different channel.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's...  I thought it was the other one.  That's all right.  We've got to eat anyway, Jimmy.  I know.  I just want to see...  I just wish he would come in.  I want to know about Anthony.  He said something about staying indoors for a week straight.  Oh, yeah.  Book series by Rick Riordan.  My seven-year-old son has read this book, so...  You stink.  I thought it was the top one.  So did I.  No.  It never works.  Lie after lie.  Yes! 
[02:25:00]  Look at him.  Look at him.  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  He's very...  His hands are always moving.  He knows what to do with his hands.  Why can't he just do our show?  Yes.  I got Michael Jackson's unreleased song, Another Day in Front of Me.  Is it called Another Day in Front of Me or Another...  All right.  You had it.  Done with that bit.  Who gives a shit?  Why don't we take a break and we'll continue.  I want to find out about Anthony indoors for a week.  Yeah.  That sounds kind of Howard Hughes-ish.  I love it.  Howard Hughes-ish. 
[02:25:30]  Loved it.  All right.  We'll find out next.  Outdoors.  Shmoutdoors.  Shmoutdoors.  Shmoutdoors.  Shmoutdoors.  That's a good joke.  Thank you, Jimmy.  We save our best jokes for the break.  Oh, of course we do.  That's smart.  We were all four dicks in a row at the pisser today in the bathroom.  That's nice.  Dude, is there anything better than eating an egg sandwich and taking a leak at the same time? 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm thinking about $35,000.  At one point, though, my mouth was full.  So I had to put my egg sandwich down on the top of the urinal.  No, you didn't.  Yes, because I didn't want fucking dripping in my pants.  You then threw this sandwich away.  No.  There was one last tasty bite left.  There's no way you put one bite of a sandwich on the top of the urinal, then ate it. 
[02:26:30]  I absolutely did.  What the hell, man?  It's all right.  Got to throw a little germs in your body.  It makes you healthier.  A little?  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  Then there was some savage in the stall taking some fucking ridiculous diarrhea dump.  It's called an old man's.  Oh, I just heard.  It's an old man dump.  It was loosey.  Loosey goosey. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, I missed that.  I wish I would have stayed.  Oh, you didn't hear the loosey.  No.  I love hearing a good watery dump.  It's like music to my ears.  It was an old man dump.  That's just an old man dump.  When I hear a watery dump, I sometimes go, listen to the children of the night.  The children of the night.  Like Dracula likes the wolves.  You know that guy was like wiping shit off his old ball bag because it's hanging in the  fucking water?  What's better than a great watery shit when you have to actually fucking towel off the 
[02:27:30]  back of your thighs?  I love taking watery shit.  His balls were steeping in the toilet.  A good soupy evacuation.  Those dumps rule.  The type of dump where you go, oh boy, toilet paper isn't going to do the job.  I'm going right into the shower.  I'm showering off.  You know when you actually have a stomach ache that goes from your kneecaps to your  fucking breastbone and you know it's just all pain from dumpage. 
[02:28:00]  Every part of your digestive system is being affected by it.  It's aching.  Until it comes out.  And why doesn't your ass just want to get rid of it immediately?  It's got to go up, up, up, up, up, up, here we go, a little bit.  Right, right.  Why?  It doesn't want to release the whole damn right away.  Anthony?  Well, it didn't take long for us to get into some shit talk, but I see somebody's hand 
[02:28:30]  to do a disc.  Yeah.  Michael Jackson, another day.  This is a unreleased song that has hit the internet today.  Ah.  Enough about Michael Jackson gives a shit.  Anthony, what?  A week inside?  Let's get into this.  What happened?  I spent a week indoors and I didn't even realize until I got home from a little vacation and  I stepped out of the vehicle and it was freezing fucking cold out.  We've had some cold weather here in New York. 
[02:29:00]  So, so, um, well, I wasn't far.  I was in Atlantic City.  So, yeah, I'm talking basically the same weather, a few degrees different.  Did some of that gambling?  Yeah.  Did some of that gambling.  Borgata?  Stay with the Borgata.  They treat me like, like a king.  Like a gatta.  I love it.  Are you going back to the Borgata when Jimmy's down there?  I think so.  What's that, MLK weekend?  15, 16 only, Friday, Saturday.  Jimmy, can I go?  I would like you to come, actually, but you never do.  I would love you to come.  No, I'm officially going. 
[02:29:30]  So, how do I get this done?  Um, we'll have Kenny arrange all the arrangements.  I will be there, Jimmy.  Tickets are, I think, on Ticketmaster or the Borgata website.  You can grab some tickets.  I saw little Jimmy's picture up there.  Because they got the screens and they change for the entertainers and they're all over the place.  And every so often I'd look over and there's my pal, little Jimmy Norton.  Just there, saying, you know, that he's going to be there at the Borgata.  Yes.  Nice.  Friday, Saturday.  Yeah.  Some jokes. 
[02:30:00]  I'm going to do my once a year gambling.  Ah.  I'm up to, I'm a twice a year gambler now, Andy.  Twice a year?  You'd be proud.  I haven't been.  Twice a year now.  Dude, I don't remember the last time I went to a casino.  It's been a while.  It's been a long ass while.  I'm glad you brought that up so now I can say this.  I was thinking that same thing.  Like, Ant doesn't go to the casino as much as he used to.  So in my stupid mind, when he gets thinking, I'm like, ooh, what happened at the casino that he hasn't been back? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, what happened?  Did he take a hit?  Oh, no, no.  You didn't take a hit?  You just took a break?  Like, there wasn't really a reason.  Most of the times I went to a casino was because we were probably doing a show-related thing close to a casino.  Made it easy.  Yeah, made it easy.  Or I was taking a vacation and didn't have plans to go away.  Right.  So Atlantic City or Mohegan is close?  I just thought you took a major hit and had to, like, kind of rest.  No, I've taken some hits, that's for sure. 
[02:31:00]  But nothing to the point where I'm like, oh, my God, I've got to stop gambling.  Can I correct you, Anthony?  By the way, Anthony goes, most of the times I go to a casino, let me insert the reason, there's an emotional, unspiritual vacuum that needs to be filled.  So instead of doing it with love and friendship, I go and I gamble.  All right.  That's one way to do it.  Somebody has been to therapy.  No, not in a month.  Whatever pumps you through the day, that's what I say.  I fucking realize I need another cycle.  God damn it.  Yes, of course you do. 
[02:31:30]  I thought I was cured.  You don't get cured.  There's no end to it.  I go in cycles.  I go in cycles.  But it doesn't work to go in cycles.  Yeah, and when it gets to a point where you're making up shit to pass the time, you realize, okay, I can take a break from this.  Then you have to go deeper.  You have to go, look, I'm making up shit to pass time.  What am I not doing right?  And you have to get your own therapist.  I'm not going, I'm not going to be a regular.  I do cycles, but I'm going to do another cycle.  Every time, what happens is you get close to hitting something uncomfortable, and then sometimes, not you. 
[02:32:00]  No, no, not you.  No, no, I got some shit out.  Therapy has to be continuous.  I got some good, no.  I think that's where people make a mistake.  Yeah.  I really do, because then you depend on it, and then you're fucking, and then you start, like, talking about the time your dad didn't buy you a bike when you were 10 or some dumb thing.  By the way.  It just happens to people who gives a shit.  Let me nip this in the bud.  Lydia, don't call.  Put the phone down.  No one cares.  She's dialing right now.  Yeah, she's dialing.  Put the phone down.  But anyway, it's not about me, because Ant was at a casino for a week. 
[02:32:30]  Yes, he was.  I want to hear all about it.  I was just going to go for a couple of days, because, you know, the first week of vacation was spent with a lot of Christmas festivities and stuff, and I do a whole big family thing, Christmas Eve, and then Christmas Day over the house.  Little rugrats now all over the goddamn place.  It's ridiculous.  And all I did, like, the next day was look around and go, there's kid handprints everywhere.  You don't like your little nephew and niece?  I love them. 
[02:33:00]  They're adorable.  But they're at that age where they can smear shit, right?  I looked at, like, the bottom window in one of my rooms looked like that last scene in Blair Witch with the little handprints all over the place.  I'm like, what?  They've got to touch everything?  And what, are they working a friolator?  What are the kids doing that their hands are the greasiest things I've ever freaking seen leaf prints?  Enough!  Kids rule until they start moving around. 
[02:33:30]  I had kids over for my Christmas, too.  Yeah.  And at one point, they were taking turns just kicking my walls.  Oh, that's good.  That's good.  That's a great time for a kid.  And jumping off a, and most people know I don't really give a shit about fucking, like, nice things, but I do have a nice leather chair.  Ah, not to them.  No.  It was a place to stand to jump from there to the windowsill.  I, uh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  I, I can't.  And then I, I noticed...  How do you compete with a kid just kicking your wall?  Kicking your wall is ridiculous.  I don't understand.  Because I get freaked out just by the greasy little fingerprints.  I have a nice round, like, glass and wood table and stuff like that.  Mm-hmm.  And around the entire perimeter was just like, because they hold on to it, and then they go around and around and around.  And it was just smeared with...  Put a little Windex and that's done.  Yeah, I understand.  It's all the, all the smear marks you can't see that you're never going to clean because you just, you just don't see it. 
[02:34:30]  But here's, here was my dilemma.  Huh.  I had, uh, shindigs, uh, um, uh, for Christmas, and, and the maids had already come over.  So once the Christmas thing was done, I'm stuck there, like, looking around going, I can't, I can't, the, the fingerprints freak me out.  That's why you left for a week.  I couldn't, so I just, I actually think I did, oh, wait, I fled the house.  You're right. 
[02:35:00]  See, I'm, I'm, I'm kind of, I'm kind of getting recollections of what happened.  I fled the house to the point where Ange, Keith's wife, takes care of my business and stuff like that, walked into a disaster.  I left everything just, and then ran.  Food, food was left, like, laying out.  Food in the oven, you're just like, fuck it.  Oven, on the table, still, like, set.  I just ran, ran out of the house.  I forgot, I, uh, before we get into your, uh, AC story, I had a kid. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Who doesn't like wearing clothes.  Huh?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  I know that, rascal.  And, uh.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  And had, uh, explosive diarrhea in my vestibule.  Oh, shit.  Okay, see, if that would be.  See, but if the kid likes clothes, it's all contained, but because the kid doesn't like  clothes, you can only imagine what explosive diarrhea is like coming from a kid that's not  wearing clothes. 
[02:36:00]  First of all, can I, can I explain something to you?  Yes.  Who is letting their kid run around with no clothes on in somebody else's house?  Um, it's my brother's kid.  All right.  My brother, I would, I would say, hey, Joe, clothes, clothes on the kid.  I don't want naked baby ass marks on my tables.  And this year, I had a no shoes, uh, policy, but one of the kids can't live without his  shoes on.  No.  And the parents said, and let the kid have his shoes on, and he was one of the kids that 
[02:36:30]  decided he needed to kick my wall a lot with his shoes on.  That's why he needs the shoes.  What?  Oh, my God.  I didn't hear that.  That's why he needs the shoes, or else he'd break his little toesies.  He can't kick the walls without shoes on.  Oh, my God.  You ever kick a wall with no shoe?  It hurts.  Can I tell you another thing?  I'm sorry that I'm, I'm taking, because I, I do want to hear about AC, but you're bringing  back all these memories.  But this year, I planned, because I have, I do a little Christmas thing after Christmas 
[02:37:00]  for my family now, and there's about 10 under the age of 11.  10 kids under the age of 11 running around my house, which I haven't seen yet, still  at, in the new year, you should.  Oh, I know.  But it's a small place.  It's not like your big, huge, fucking compound.  Now, so I, I got the idea, you know what, I'm going to fucking power up that Wii, I'm  going to buy every fucking game known to kids, they will be distracted, and I'll be  fine this year, a lot less stress.  So they're starting to kick the walls and jump off the leather fucking chair, and this 
[02:37:30]  and that.  I'm like, all right, it's time to fire up the Wii.  Yeah.  You know, the fucking thing burnt out.  I couldn't turn on the fucking Wii.  Your Wii broke?  That was my go-to fucking solution.  No Wii.  So another two to three hours of walls being kicked, and a full hockey game in my vestibule.  That's why you need no less than five gaming systems in your house at any given moment.  Dude, I had the PS3, but I don't think they wanted to play Tiger Woods. 
[02:38:00]  No, huh?  That's the only game I have for my PS3.  Yeah, the, uh.  Sorry, but back to it.  The kids over the house, it was just like, okay, all right, well, whatever.  What is that about?  It was a little rough.  It's a little rough.  A little rough.  They, you know.  A little rough.  I love them, but a little rough.  Yeah.  And they're standing on chairs that are more expensive than the houses they live in.  It's a little rough.  Yeah, yeah.  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, you just try to have nice things. 
[02:38:30]  See, that's the thing.  It's like.  But they look at you like, hey, I'm like, yeah, but I, I'm lucky enough to have nice  things.  That doesn't mean that.  That's why.  We should just blow off the fact that I have nice things.  I count my blessings.  Of course.  That I have nice things.  That's all.  And, and, and then when animals or, or people ruin them, I get like, why bother?  Then I'll just go to Ikea.  One kid brought one of those Super Bowls that picks up all the dirt. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, that's Timothy.  I like to make him chase it with butter on him.  One kid brought a Super Bowl ball that picks up all the dirt and decided he was bored that  he needed to bounce some off my wall.  Your walls must.  There was, there was no less than 40 to 50 ball marks on this one wall.  You need a painter to come in now?  Yeah.  I couldn't, I can't scrub it off or whatever. 
[02:39:30]  How many kids were there?  About 10 or 11.  How, for how long?  For six days.  Oh, my God.  About six hours.  That's fine.  One day.  Damn, that's right.  Marshmallow.  Oh, who's brilliant idea was that?  What's this?  I don't know.  That was Christmas Day?  What's this?  Everything's, my whole vacation's a blur, by the way.  Oh, by the way, Lydia's saying a lot of people do therapy in cycles, Jimmy. 
[02:40:00]  I can't what she said.  It doesn't work in cycles.  It works for me.  It doesn't work.  It works.  No, it's progressive.  You saw some improvements.  What happens is when you do something, and it's not you, you as the collective you, you  do something in cycles, there's X amount of progress, and then all of a sudden, ah, it  stops, and then it just kind of plateaus, and then you just talk about the mistakes you  made while plateauing instead of delving further in.  Well, there was an understanding, though, with the lady I talked to.  She knew that it was time for me to just kind of, you know, walk in. 
[02:40:30]  Just walk away.  And take what I learned, and then do something with it.  Yeah.  There was an understanding, actually.  She was like, yeah, you're good for now.  And she's an idiot.  And I don't, again, any therapist that would say you're good for now, after less than a  year of therapy, for anybody.  She didn't officially say you're good for now.  It was just an understanding, like, yeah, you should go and...  She probably went, you should go and find another therapist.  And work the lessons that we learned here. 
[02:41:00]  What's a marshmallow gun, eh?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  In someone's infinite wisdom, they decided to buy two marshmallow guns.  They shoot those little mini marshmallows that you put in hot chocolate.  Where?  All over my house.  Who the fuck invented...  This is a guy that hates kids.  Are you fucking kidding me?  It was in my basement.  Thank God they didn't know about the marshmallow guns when they came to my house. 
[02:41:30]  And, yeah, marshmallows are being shot all over, and I'm trying to pick them up.  And the worst offender was my drunken Aunt Yvonne.  Oh, my God, was she hammered.  And she's just shooting them into Danny's face, and little kids, and she's just like, wah.  And then somebody...  God damn, what a bunch of fucking drunks.  Somebody decided, let me grab a beer, and, you know, pulled the tap handle, filled up their glass, and then walked away. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, good.  And about, I don't know how many gallons of beer just spilt out all over the floor of the  board.  Wow.  Are you serious?  So we're down there, and my Aunt Fran is a saint.  She's able to, you know, clean very well and everything like that, so everything got cleaned up.  But Yvonne, at that point, is looking around, and we're all...  Like, this is a big thing.  We're all just, like, grabbing paper towels, anything we can, and kind of a little panicky  that so much beer spilt on the floor, I don't want the place to smell like a brewery and stuff 
[02:42:30]  like that.  And Yvonne just leans over at one point and goes, why are you doing so many dishes back  there?  Thinking like we're washing dishes behind the bar.  Just not a clue of what was going on.  She's probably the one that did the fucking tap.  I was thinking maybe hit it for something with a marshmallow gun.  I don't know.  It was just...  Dude, I want to know about this marshmallow.  This sounds like the worst kid toy ever.  You pull the thing back and forth.  There can't be a worst kid toy.  It goes, dunk, dunk, dunk, dunk, and just rapid fire pumps out little tiny Swiss Miss-sized 
[02:43:00]  marshmallows.  All over the house?  Yes.  Were people stepping on them?  Yeah, a couple of people stepped on them.  And then now you're just walking on rugs and whatever.  Stepping on a freshly fired marshmallow.  It wasn't that bad.  It's after the marshmallows have been reloaded like three or four times that now they're  like soft and mushy.  Mushy.  Then they get sticky.  Why would you allow that in your house?  I shouldn't have.  Hey, look, he's got a marshmallow.  Put it in the fucking car. 
[02:43:30]  It's not really Anthony's house at this point.  He just lives there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's everybody else's house.  Yeah, whatever.  But all the marshmallows did come up.  I think Danny had to scrape the floor at one point.  But that's insane that they even have something like that.  Oh, I know.  That's insane.  There's no need to have that.  A marshmallow gun.  Christ almighty.  No.  Enough.  How'd you do with the thing?  Oh, then, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so then you fleed.  So I fled.  Went there.  I was going to stay for a few days. 
[02:44:00]  You should be on Jersey Shore.  Anthony fleed.  I fleed.  I fleed.  Oh, Jesus.  I was doing good today, too.  Went, me, Danny, and Keith went down to the Borgata.  Hung out down there.  They just hooked up.  Big, sweet, and butler.  Whole thing.  Oh, wow.  Oh, you just call up and go like, yeah, I need reservations at this restaurant for this  time. 
[02:44:30]  Okay.  There's no like, whoa, we don't have that.  Well, that's because of, you know, your action.  Well, yeah.  You got to explain that to them.  The entertainers don't get treated like that, believe me.  It was.  That's because of the action.  Nice.  I mean, fucking nice.  Hung out there and wound up, I was going to come home, I guess, Wednesday or something  like that.  And my brother was down, too.  That's right.  My brother came down, too.  So we're all just gambling, having a fun time and everything.  And then Wednesday rolled around like, what the?  Where am I going? 
[02:45:00]  Why?  So I called up and I said, I'd like the room till Sunday.  All right.  You got back yesterday?  Yeah, I got back yesterday.  Good afternoon.  Wow.  They were just like, all righty, no problem.  So I stayed there, did some power gambling, just power gambling.  A few listeners, too, hanging out.  Had a good time.  And must say, without being specific, I did okay. 
[02:45:30]  You tweeted a picture.  That was early.  That picture was pretty impressive.  Oh, no, that was way early.  Let me tell you.  But wasn't that?  No, that was.  That's it?  Yeah.  It looked like that.  Yeah.  No.  That was.  Man.  Wow.  It was a good time was had.  Wow.  Wow.  And yeah, I will be going back.  And believe me, they will be welcoming me with open arms. 
[02:46:00]  Let me take you to the back room and just fucking knock you out.  Hey, no.  You know what's happening.  You know what's happening.  It's all out.  Yeah.  Take the hammer or the money.  You can't have both.  Yeah.  See?  That's.  I thought it was twice that.  No, because each one of those is eh.  I thought each one of those was eh.  Uh-uh.  Why not?  No.  No, the ehs are a different color.  Yeah.  Can you see that picture, Dan? 
[02:46:30]  That's.  That could be.  That could be the room.  Jesus.  But then it was.  Wow.  Take that and triple it.  That's your room now.  Part of it.  Holy fucking shit.  It was a huge two-bedroom suite.  So Danny and Keith got to share the room with the two queen beds in it.  As they should have been queens.  And no lock on the bathroom door.  Oh, yeah.  So Keith, Danny's showering and Keith just walks in with the flip cam and starts videotaping 
[02:47:00]  naked Danny in the shower.  I'm gay.  I covered my cock.  I got shampoo in my hair.  And then, you know, he's got the shot and he's just standing there.  And I'm just cupping my dick and balls.  And I'm like, what do you want?  You got it.  What are you doing?  Just go away now.  Oh, dude.  You should lock the door.  I was like, yeah, I should.  Okay, now leave.  Just lock.  Just fucking leave.  Hey.  Hey, just because I don't want it to fly by.  They're now reporting that Tiger Woods, we'll do your Tiger Woods news in a little while,  that he gave his wife $300 million for Christmas. 
[02:47:30]  No.  That's what they're saying, though.  It was.  The quote was from her, I believe.  She was over her, apparently her friends.  And they said, what did Ty give you for Christmas?  And she said $300 million and left.  Meaning.  Meaning his fuck up.  Meaning that's what.  Meaning his fuck up.  It's going to cost him $300 million.  Oh, boy.  Why is the news, by the way?  This is the media.  Why are they standing outside the hotel where Tiger Woods is in New York? 
[02:48:00]  Opening up.  How is that fucking news?  I'm fucking going there with my flip today.  How is that news, though?  I'm going to race holy hell.  No, I'm going to fuck with these guys.  How is that news?  Yeah.  Well, the Tiger thing.  Big story.  But where is that newsworthy?  Why is that fucking news?  Rumor has it he's going into sex rehab or whatever.  Why would he be a Trump?  Why would he be a Trump?  And Anthony said, yeah, this is the worst time to.  Why do that after your wife leaves and it's over?  Right.  You go to sex addict. 
[02:48:30]  Because that's for sponsors.  That means you're going to get better.  That you're learning from what happened.  People love a good comeback.  You should just be fucking like even more so now.  At this point, what do you have to lose?  Out in the open.  Just hit some of the bars with chicks on each arm.  Just fucking going into the bathroom.  I'm a big golf fan.  I want Tiger Woods to come back.  This is what I wish.  Tiger Woods comes back just looking gnarly.  Long fucking maybe a big dreads or afro.  Big poof afro or dreads is good. 
[02:49:00]  Goatee.  An evil goatee.  The evil.  Horrible bangs under his eyes and still just kicks everyone's ass on the tour.  No more good guys.  No, I don't want to see the good guy anymore.  Yeah, he's done.  Now I want to see him just reinvent himself.  Yeah, reinvent yourself into a heel.  Do a heel turn.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tiger does a heel turn.  Just no sportsmanship anymore.  Yeah.  No shaking of hands or taking that cap off.  None of that shit.  He's yelling like fuck you to the other guys. 
[02:49:30]  He's just throwing clubs when he's missing shots and yelling and screaming.  Oh, would that be great?  Oh, that would rule.  So what else?  What about AC?  What about?  Blackjack was your poison?  Yeah, played a little poker.  I do good in poker until I don't do good.  I was up.  I was doing very well.  And then you make that move.  You need a lot of patience to play poker.  Yeah, a lot of it's just fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold.  You've got to hang in there and be very patient.  I don't like that. 
[02:50:00]  That was good.  But just playing is fun, poker.  And it's not like you're losing a shitload of money like you can at blackjack.  But you can also make a lot of money at blackjack.  You do some three-card?  Me and Danny played a little three-card for a little while.  And I hit like the biggest hand possible.  Straight flush?  No.  I mean a royal flush?  Now that it's called the mini-royal.  The mini-royal.  Which is the ace, king, and queen suited. 
[02:50:30]  And it pays $100 to one.  I know it does.  I hit that bitch.  You know, all the years I've played a three-card, I've never hit for anything big.  Really?  I've only done, I think, the 10 to one.  You've got to play long enough and keep your ass in the seat, and hopefully you hit something.  My whole thing is, though, when you do hit, because that's a luck game, you've got to walk.  Did you walk after the royal?  Fuck no.  Hung out for a little while.  I wound up leaving with more money than I sat down with at that table.  But I don't look at three-card, I don't look at the three-card table thinking, here's where I'm going to make, you know, some money. 
[02:51:00]  I like three-card.  That's just relaxing.  Yeah, three-card is just a social, social good time.  Yeah, a lot of people at the table yapping and shit like that.  You've got to play three-card with people, you know, or a cool table.  It's just fun, and you don't even care, you know, your odds suck.  Me and Danny were laughing, just playing.  It was funny, because that's exactly how that table was.  It was just like six guys there.  Because blackjacks, you're hitting at the wrong time, and the whole table hates you, and  you're like, I'm just down here having fun.  I didn't read no fucking book.  We kept hearing other tables wooing, you know, because it happens occasionally. 
[02:51:30]  So then our table decided that we were just going to be the most obnoxious pricks in the  whole place.  And just like, no matter what came out, it could have been a low pair.  Everybody was like, woo!  Woo!  We're making noise.  Every deal.  There was some old fuck that was at a table across from us that just kept, like, quickly  turning his head and looking over, like, he was so annoyed that we were wooing.  Tough shit.  And Sandy the dealer, who was giving the same fucking four jokes over and over again.  Oh, God, that's right.  I forgot about Sandy the dealer. 
[02:52:00]  Hi, Sandy.  No, he.  No, he.  He had jokes?  Oh, he had a whole rep.  Because he was a comedian, and he's also on the radio.  So, yeah.  What's his name?  Sandy Beaches?  Good one, Chip.  Chip, can I tell you something about that?  There was a Sandy Beach that did moorings in Buffalo.  For real?  Oh, really?  For real?  I know you're doing shit, but I have to bring that to the table. 
[02:52:30]  So many Sandy Beaches.  That there was actually a Sandy Beach that did moorings in Buffalo when I was up there.  Sandy Beach.  So you've got to know when to walk away.  Like, I did some gambling this week at the Hard Rock in Fort Lauderdale.  Oh, did you?  And I was up, dropped down to 20 on the video poker.  Oh.  Went up to 70.  Jesus Christ.  Stopped.  Then I wound up losing some more.  So I walked away with $10.  Hey, see?  You walked away a winner.  Bet.  I didn't gamble at all on Saturday.  And it was my last night there. 
[02:53:00]  I had a great Friday night.  And then I just decided, you know something?  I'm not even going back downstairs.  I'm not giving them one more dime back.  So I sat and watched crappy movies in the room.  And Sunday morning, I got up and left.  You want to take this one or should I?  Why?  Why?  How bad was the hang of it?  That's exactly it.  It was vomiting.  I said to myself, I'm just going to lay here and throw up on myself with a cold cloth on my head.  Let me think.  You were taking a sink shower.  All right, Saturday morning was pretty bad. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  But no, Saturday night was fine.  Went out to dinner.  You just didn't feel like gambling anymore?  I was done.  And I was like, my brother came down again at that point.  And I was just like, you know something?  I already did everything I could possibly do here as far as gambling goes.  So why don't I just say, you know what?  I'm not going to give him back any money.  If I make more money, it'll rule.  But I've pretty much done okay here this week. 
[02:54:00]  You're in a good spot.  Let me leave.  And again, when I got home, that was the time that, because the car comes in through the carport area, which is heated.  You walk in, drive out.  So the first air that I actually got from outside from the time I left Monday was yesterday.  You were down there a week?  A week without seeing outside.  I did not see or feel the weather. 
[02:54:30]  Like, everybody was like, oh, yeah, it's cold.  It's cold.  I'm like, I have no idea.  I did not leave a building for a week.  You missed a week of winter.  I know.  It was great.  It was fan-fucking-tastic.  Did you take in a show while you were down there?  No, I didn't.  What horrendous show is happening down there.  There's always one bad one.  There's like Lady Gaga is going to be down there.  She's there the night I'm there.  Jimmy Norton.  Yes, Jimmy Norton. 
[02:55:00]  Maybe she'll go to your show.  Is going to be down there.  Yes, her and her giant shark fin clit.  Yes.  And then they maybe, like, there's a red card and a black card.  The red card, you know, when you get rated and stuff, they rate you, you give them the  red card.  Or the black card is like, oh, okay, I've been playing.  They gave me a titanium card.  And of all the tables I was sitting in, I had not even seen one the whole time.  You're a whale.  I didn't have, I have a titanium.  What's that mean?  I don't know. 
[02:55:30]  That means that there will be a backroom situation eventually with Anthony.  I don't know what the titanium is.  What does the card enable you to do?  Well, you get rated with the card.  So you give your card when you get money, when you win money, as you're playing, for  how long you're playing, how much you're betting, things like that.  Basically, they know he bets a lot.  And then you get the dollars.  So they take care of that person, hoping that he's going to come back and lose all his money.  You get dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You get comp dollars with that, that you can buy things with and stuff. 
[02:56:00]  And all I know is I had, and this is not through winning or this is just comp dollars.  It's in the thousands of dollars, in comp dollars.  And that, I don't even have to use them to pay for the room or anything.  Like, they just toss me the room.  It's amazing.  It's like, here's a suite for a week.  Amazing.  Gee, thanks.  You go to the spa?  No.  Why would I do that?  Massage?  The spa's great, actually.  No.  I've been to the Borgata spa.  Why would I go to the spa for a massage when in the suite itself is a massage room? 
[02:56:30]  Is there really?  Yes.  I swear to you.  Table, massage table, separate room, everything.  And you could have, you know.  Did you get your ball bag rubbed?  I could have when three hookers, which we had hookers?  Nice.  Me and Keith were calling the Charlie's Angels hookers.  Yeah.  Because there was a black one, an Asian one, and a white one.  Oh, you know.  And they came up to me at the table, one of the tables when I was playing.  And it was, you know, a high stakes table.  And they come up and just start talking. 
[02:57:00]  And I'm just like, wow, these girls really must like us.  I just thought I was doing great with you.  You're a hooker.  Yeah.  And they come up.  And the Asian girl, like, had a tulip or something in her hand.  Yeah.  And she puts it under my nose and goes, I just want you to smell my flower.  I'm like, oh, you mean your pussy.  You mean your sideways pussy.  And then they're hanging out. 
[02:57:30]  She gives me her phone number or some shit.  And I'm like, yeah, okay, well, you know, I'm here.  She goes, well, you know where to get us.  And they walk away.  And then Keith goes, I've got to see how much they're even charging.  This is ridiculous.  So he goes up, and they wouldn't talk price in the building, they said.  Did he find out, though?  No.  He goes, ah, fuck.  Where would they talk price?  In the room?  I guess in the room.  And they already got you.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, honey, for me to come up for my time, it's $300. 
[02:58:00]  I ain't fucking.  But if you want, it's a fucking scam.  First of all, Jimmy, how much would it be?  They know how much money he's betting.  They see his room.  They're probably going to want $1,000.  Oh, yeah.  They want $1,000?  They would want a lot of money.  Would you get the fucking, you know, the ass?  I would never go with those.  Would you get the ass for $1,000?  I don't know.  I would call Jimmy like an agent to negotiate my deal.  Right.  Hi, yeah, no, that's not going to wash, honey.  Who do you think you're dealing with?  This isn't my first time at the rodeo.  Exactly.  You don't even have a dick under that skirt. 
[02:58:30]  What do you mean you want $800?  Club soda, Kenny?  Do you want something to add?  But, Jimmy, it would be a thou?  I'm guessing because they know how much he's making.  But whenever they won't talk pry, get the fuck out of here.  You brought up massages, and I just wanted to say, me and Jimmy were in a fancy hotel for New Year's weekend.  Yes.  And we went to the spa, and he treated me to a massage.  Oh, he did?  Does he do a good job?  No, he bought me one, and I requested a male masseuse because I didn't want to feel like I was cheating on my wife. 
[02:59:00]  And I ended up cheating on my wife anyway.  If you only knew as he was talking, I wish that microphone would have exploded like a fucking, like one of those Civil War guns, like a musket.  I had to hear that fucking joke.  He emailed Amy Schumer.  I saw her at the Comedy Cellar.  She goes, why is Kenny emailing me jokes or texting me jokes? 
[02:59:30]  He's been trying that fucking joke.  Well, hold on a minute.  Hold on a minute.  I'm sure you got it.  Oh, my God.  You have the jokes.  This is off of Opie's email.  I got a massage today.  I asked for a male masseuse because I didn't want to feel like I was cheating on my wife.  And ended up cheating on my wife anyway.  LOL.  No, that was me.  Oh, no.  Because that's what it deserved.  LOL.  I'm an LOL. 
[03:00:00]  But let me, while we're talking about it, while we're talking about it.  Oh, I had a joke that worked once and then just bombed every time.  And I tried it every single new table I went to.  What a joke.  See, when you're playing blackjack and the dealer pulls that fucking ace out, they go, insurance, insurance.  You know, and that way you could put up a little bet and you win the bet back if the deal has blackjack.  That way you don't lose your entire bet.  So I would go, I hear Obama's plan is covering that too, so I'm set. 
[03:00:30]  Did it work?  It worked once and bombed every other table I did it at.  To the point where Danny's just going, didn't work out, didn't it?  I just knew I was bombing.  Well, you should have said this is the best way.  Yes, Chip?  Is when I go to insurance, I would always yell, yeah, call Allstate for their good hands.  I fucking hate you.  I just, I can't do this.  Chip is the worst.  I hate you.  I can't wait for Chip's birthday message on the news. 
[03:01:00]  Chip needs a last name.  Yes.  He has one.  Oh.  Oh, what is it?  Chip Chipison.  No, it isn't.  Yes, it is.  The TMZ kid just BBM'd me.  I got that stupid joke on BBM as well.  I don't know how.  You sent it to Mike?  Yeah.  You just fucking.  You loved your own joke.  Mass text him.  See, I feel like I'm special when I get an email from Kenny, but I'm just fucking. 
[03:01:30]  No.  He sends to all.  He blind CCs everybody.  That's all he does.  Yes.  Yeah, he doesn't even write it over and over again.  Don't you notice when he goes, dear friend?  Right.  Kenny.  Besides Dick Clark, Kenny made me depressed on New Year's as well.  Really?  Dick Clark and Kenny.  Because Kenny wrote about his New Year's.  Where were you?  You were eating a dry?  Listen, this is what he did for New Year's.  For real.  I had a great New Year's Eve.  My friend Jimmy did two terrific shows that evening. 
[03:02:00]  We rang in the New Year with some salutations.  Good.  And then, you know, Jimmy, he was a little busy.  And I was all alone.  So I went down to the coffee shop all by my lonesome and sat at the counter and had a hot  open turkey sandwich and a ginger ale.  He's the worst.  He doesn't know how to.  Wow. 
[03:02:30]  I made him get the massage.  He didn't want to.  He doesn't know how to have a good time.  I'm like, get the massage.  That is horrid.  I took him, during the break, I took Kenny to one of my Islanders games there, Islander  game, whatever.  He just didn't even know where he was.  It was one of the best games of the year and he's just sitting there.  You don't have a good time or you're just like, you're simple and you have a simple good  time.  There's no reason to pay attention to me.  Although, all right.  We were making videos at the Coliseum and he didn't make me laugh really hard because 
[03:03:00]  there was a kid on a Zamboni.  You know, the Zamboni goes through and there's that.  Don't tell me he yelled at the kid on the Zamboni because that's our joke together that  he did when we were out in the fucking mall.  No, it's different.  Okay.  What?  Wait, show the video there, Danny.  On my dumb chat.  That was a different thing.  Okay.  Wait, I'm hoping it's very similar now.  Just the fact that he's yelling at the Zamboni guy.  I'm hoping it's similar.  But basically, before the game, they do the Zamboni thing. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, no.  Go to YouTube.  Oh, it's YouTube.  Sorry.  Yeah.  They do the Zamboni thing and what they do is they have a kid with the guy.  Yeah.  It's a really, it's a nice, thrilling thing for the kid.  I bet it is.  You probably got to win it.  It's a big deal.  Like your birthday.  You know, it's a big deal.  Go down to the right.  It's, yeah, it's, it's right about, a little further down.  It's, you, you, yeah, right.  One more down.  Right there.  And speaking of Mustard's picture.  Look at the Zamboni kid's waving and nobody gives a shit. 
[03:04:00]  Look at the Zamboni kid's waving and nobody gives a shit.  What a fucking asshole.  This is the most.  Time of the kid's life.  Yeah.  It's literally the most exciting thing to ever happen to this seven-year-old.  And it's just not so often.  Look at his Zamboni kid's waving and nobody gives a shit.  He was right, though.  The kid's waving like he's the president and no one has paid attention.  For like 15 minutes while that thing's doing the whole ice.  They fucking get liability insurance for that. 
[03:04:30]  Loop after loop.  Get to sign something.  Fuck, sign it.  You can sign anything you want.  If your little seven-year-old busts his head, it doesn't matter what you sign.  Your kid falls off and winds up like the kid in the Omen, part two.  Does your kid have any problem with Damien?  Loop after loop, this fucking kid's waving and no one gave a shit.  Is that similar to what he does with you in the mall?  No, no, no.  We were in the mall and there was a Zamboni, it was a giant mall in Houston.  And he was just yelling questions to the Zamboni guy as he drove. 
[03:05:00]  It was very funny.  I may have one.  I don't remember.  He was just shouting at the Asian Zamboni guy.  Yeah.  Because he can't, I don't know how often he comes out, but he backs out into the thing.  And me and Jimmy just happened to stop for a minute.  As he's backing out, as he's backing out, Kenny yells, careful.  And that's what started.  Now, every lap around, I was like yelling at him.  That careful made me laugh so hard.  Oh, great, Ken. 
[03:05:30]  You know how I must have annoyed that guy?  I don't want to lose this call.  We're learning more about the Zamboni kids.  Go ahead, Ken.  Oh, no.  Hello, Davey.  Hey, buddy.  Oh, no.  The freaking, at the hockey games, the Zamboni kids are like the Garden of Dreams Foundation.  They're the dying kids.  That's why that wave is, that little pitiful wave is like that last cast.  Oh, my God.  It's their moment, you asshole.  Okay.  Wait, now I've got to hear you again.  All right.  Now it makes sense. 
[03:06:00]  Make-a-wish kids.  The liability insurance and everything.  You know.  Look at the Zamboni kids waving and nobody gives a shit.  Oh, the poor little kid.  Look at him.  His hair's falling out onto the ice.  Oh, shit.  And you're making fun of him.  Oh, that's terrible.  It's on my YouTube channel, OP Radio, if you want to check it out.  I made a lot of dumb videos.  Oh.  Oh, do the other one above Zamboni kid. 
[03:06:30]  Some dope guy to engage.  I hate when people get engaged at sporting events.  I'm probably talking to a few people that have done this.  And I didn't catch the actual moment, but then I wanted to get Kenny's reaction.  Kenny!  Someone just proposed here at the hockey game.  How awful is that?  What a schmuck.  Why is he a schmuck?  Because I said so.  Well, all right.  Schmuck.  You can't hear it on mine.  Oh, really?  As the guy's driving by. 
[03:07:00]  I taped one of them.  Yeah.  And the guy's driving by and Kenny yells,  Mister, can I take a picture with you?  Every time it was Mister something.  Mister.  He's just the worst.  Mister, can I take a picture with you?  Careful.  Careful.  That was my favorite.  Because the guy backed up.  Careful.  You know, it's a good story.  We were coming home from Kansas City.  Yeah, exactly.  Real quick. 
[03:07:30]  Me, Norton, and Florentine were coming home from Kansas City.  And we get picked up like four in the morning because we get the first flight out, 6 a.m.  So we don't sleep.  Everybody's tired.  And this poor, like, limo driver, you know, he's used to dealing with, like, nice, cordial people.  And we get in the truck, and it's just Mister, a million stupid questions about Kansas City.  Yeah.  How big is this city, Mister?  It was three men asking, like, fucking childlike questions.  How fast do you drive, Mister? 
[03:08:00]  Like, that type of stuff.  Everything, Mister.  Mister is a true hallmark.  You know, is the home of, you know, Kansas City, you know.  And then he finally asked one question.  What are you guys, so what are you guys, what are you doing in town?  And it was just dead silence by us.  It's called being insufferable pricks.  That's what you are.  But I got so uncomfortable, I had to break the joke, and I go, hey, we were in town to sing Christmas carols. 
[03:08:30]  Wow, you got uncomfortable.  Yeah, that's how uncomfortable.  I didn't hear it.  I had my headphones on by that time.  I got so sick of doing Mister.  I just put my headphones on, and Jim's like, you missed it.  Fuck, that's funny, dude.  Oh, shit.  Trying to think of what else.  Goddamn.  That was something else in there.  Whatever.  So the AC was good to you.  Yeah, AC was good.  Had a good time.  Lots of money.  Well, the hookers were, it was more of a, just curious to see what they ran, because to tell you the truth, wasn't into the black chick, wasn't into the Asian, and the white chick was ridden hard and put up wet. 
[03:09:00]  If I was going to go to Atlantic City and take a stray whore up into my luxury suite, it ain't going to be one of them.  That's for sure.  That's for sure.  Does anybody have any lip balm?  Yeah, I do.  You might not like the dispenser, though.  My lips are really chapped, and I don't know how it happened inside.  Like I said, I was inside for a week.  Mine are dry as fuck. 
[03:09:30]  Maybe because my room was like, I guess I kept it at 53 degrees.  Oh, that's what I want to say.  Everyone is requesting that Ken to get a Twitter account.  Why won't he get Twitter?  You can't spell it?  What's the matter?  Mr.  Don't you use fucking Chip to cover up your bombs, motherfucker.  I hear a Jimmy voice, and then he goes, what's the matter? 
[03:10:00]  Chip Chipperson.  It's his name.  We want a story from you.  Me and Ann have told our stories today.  We want a story from the break.  Jimmy works.  Yeah, but he might have a story.  He didn't even take a vacation.  He works.  Oh, I did have some work to do.  Hey, you were over my house.  Yes, I was.  Oh, I was intoxicated.  Yes, you were.  Yes, you were.  Yes, you were.  It was fun.  It was like being on the Enterprise with Captain Drunk Hard. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, Chip.  Believe me, that wasn't Chip.  Careful.  Sounds like static.  Oh, you got it with that one.  Yeah.  My girlfriend is humiliated by Chip.  Yeah.  She's humiliated by him.  She despises Chip.  Because on elevators, it's like, it's just me, her, and him.  And then somebody will say something.  I'll be like, yeah, it's kind of windy, right?  Blew my hat right off.  I'm like, where's that hat going?  It's humiliating.  Where's that hat going? 
[03:11:00]  And he always asks her when there's a waiter comes over.  And he goes, what would you like?  She'll order a salad.  And Chip will go to the waiter.  How much does that cost?  Is that pricey?  Oh, no.  She said, people think I fucked that guy.  Your girl rules.  I like her.  She's all right.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah.  Hey, we have some birthday pranks that happened over the break.  Yeah.  What?  We got two more, believe it or not. 
[03:11:30]  No way.  Got an awkward moment from Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Penguins announced they're dropping the F-bomb.  That was no big deal.  It's just hard to say puck sometimes.  Yeah.  That's an easy one.  Retards.  And other things.  I don't know what we'll do next.  I like just hanging.  Yeah.  Let's just do that.  Stay there. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  First day back.  Feels good.  Feels good.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do this.  Let's put a couple quickies and we're going to get the fuck out of here.  We're going to start slow.  What is it?  Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Ah.  On The View.  All right.  She's the chick on The Voo. 
[03:12:30]  Stanley Tucci.  What about him?  He's in The Lovely Bones.  How's that?  The Lovely Bones.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, right.  It's that movie with the girl.  And she's dead.  I'm embarrassed to make that.  I read the fucking book.  For real.  Yeah.  You read books?  Dude, when we were off for two years, I read everything.  I mean, everything.  But there are movies to see and games to play.  Are you reading books movies?  I played some games.  Well, I read something.  They'll make a movie out of it if it's good. 
[03:13:00]  I just picked up some NHL action for the PS3.  I'm doing some NHL stuff.  Are you?  Yeah.  How's that?  It's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tweeted a picture.  And it's the last time I played Call of Duty.  Oh, with the remote?  The controller.  Yeah.  And the earphones.  Hanging in my Christmas tree.  With broken Christmas ornaments.  I threw that thing at the floor so hard it bounced up and into the Christmas tree. 
[03:13:30]  Why?  I was very angry because I suck so badly at the game.  Just because you're using the controller, right?  No.  Now I just suck.  I broke one of my controllers, too.  So, I mean, I can't even front.  But I think I might have found someone who's actually worse at Call of Duty than you.  Keith?  No.  Stephen Hawking?  I played Special Ops with Laszlo.  No way!  Laszlo's sucks?  Oh, that's great. 
[03:14:00]  Oh, that's embarrassing.  He sucks.  Oh, he's terrible.  The king has no clothes.  That rules.  How bad is he?  The wizard's just a man behind the curtain.  Holy shit.  How bad is the king of GTA?  Well, it's funny because, like...  The GTA king.  Me and him, you know, he wanted to play.  He had only been playing for, like, a day or whatever.  So we go on.  And, you know, I had a few in me, right?  So we're playing.  And I'm like, man, I think...  I was like, I think I'm so fucking drunk that I can't even play.  And I'm thinking to myself, I must be holding him back because he seems kind of annoyed. 
[03:14:30]  But it turns out it was completely the opposite way because we played again the next day.  And I was straight as an arrow.  And, boy, does he...  He stinks.  That's so good, man.  I didn't know that.  I'm at, like, one end of the board.  And, like, you know, some of those things, you have to use some kind of strategy.  You just can't, you know, weigh it.  Yeah, yeah, running gun, yeah.  You can't do that.  So, you know, I'm trying to get him to come with me.  And it's like, we have to do this now.  And I'm like, yeah, so I'm going to throw some flashes.  And, like, I look up the map. 
[03:15:00]  And, like, he's on, like, the other side of, like, where you start.  Just, like, looking around, going the wrong way.  And it's like, man, this isn't going well for me today.  You know, he always...  Is he calling already?  I knew it.  Laszlo.  Get my ass in here now.  Fuck you, Danny.  You suck at video games.  I was so hoping he wasn't listening.  What happened?  I had two bottles of wine in me.  Of course I can't speak to you.  Ah, Laszlo.  Oh, no.  There was a few.  Because, like, when you play special apps on Call of Duty, Modern Warfare 2, 
[03:15:30]  it shows you, like, how many kills you have versus how many kills your partner has.  Yeah.  And there was a few times that we had failed out where I had, like, 54 kills,  and he had, like, zero or one.  You had a helicopter.  What?  That was the one with the helicopter.  All right, so.  We're fucking going.  We had an entire Christmas vacation finishing the two games that I'd worked on before I  would allow myself to play other games.  And I fired the game up, and I shot a text to Danny, and I fucking knew. 
[03:16:00]  Because every time I sucked, I was getting so mad, I was like, this is going to be on  the fucking air in the moment.  That Laszlo sucks.  Ah, that's terrible.  You know, I just, it was great, because, you know, obviously you work for Rockstar,  you make video games for a living, so just the fact that you weren't doing as good as  me, like, I really enjoyed that, I must say.  Dude, you've been playing it for a month, I played it for a day, and I had two bottles  of wine in me.  I'm allowed to enjoy myself.  Wow, you suck, I love it.  I'm really bad.  I think I should play Anthony, because it sounds like he might be as shitty as I am. 
[03:16:30]  I'm terrible.  We were playing this one special up, where, like, you kind of need to, you need to ration  your rocket launchers and shit, because you've got to take down, like, you know, helicopters  and these trucks and stuff, and Laszlo's running around like it actually is GTA, and just shooting  rocket launchers at, like, one guy.  Yeah, you've got to take out, like, all of them.  And I'm trying to be nice, because I know he hasn't played before, so I'm trying to be  nice, so I'll be like, oh, hey, you should switch to something else, we might need that  for later.  Yeah, and then we're doing this one mission where you're supposed to be stealthy, he got so 
[03:17:00]  angry at me, because I'm like, fuck this, why am I hiding in the snow, let's go get  these motherfuckers, and he's like, I hope that one shot was worth it, because now they're  all coming out.  They're yelling at each other.  Oh, no.  You guys sound like a bad cop movie.  New name from Pat from Unaki, Laszlo's score.  Thank you.  I'm sorry, Lasz, you know I love you.  All right, Laszlo.  By the way, for all those that want to come decimate me, I am Radio Laszlo on Xbox Live. 
[03:17:30]  All right, very cool.  Yes, Radio Laszlo.  We'll play more Spec Ops later.  All right, man, later.  All right, brother.  Pop on.  Hey, that was so funny.  Fuck you, Danny.  I knew it was kind of it.  Speaking of video games, I think it's called Borderland.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is it good?  I've been hearing a lot of good things about Borderlands.  I've been hearing a buzz about it.  I thought, Travis, you playing Borderlands?  No, I wanted to.  What is it, Borderlands?  Yeah, Borderlands.  It looks, I think the people that were in charge of Half-Life had something to do with it, 
[03:18:00]  because the graphics look the same.  That's good.  But I heard it was a little too, like, RPG-ish.  Really?  For what I like, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I hear you almost had a crisis moment with Modern Warfare, where you were ready to break  something, break your controller.  No, I can't play Modern Warfare on my Xbox.  Oh, well, no, it was before.  I remember you were telling me that you had to turn your Xbox off, because you were getting  very close to throwing your controller through something.  Oh, there's always times like that.  I don't remember.  And then, you know who the biggest fucking, like, hero, killer, kick-ass fucking player 
[03:18:30]  is?  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  D-Boy.  Yeah, D-Boy poems, man.  Fucking D-Boy is the shit.  He sends me text messages, like, picture messages of what he's doing while he's playing.  How do you do that?  It's unbelievable.  I don't know how he does it.  He gloats.  He gloats, because he wants to show you how good he is.  So he'll picture message me, like, how many, like, you know, like, he's completed this  many on this difficulty.  And I'm like, dude, like, you're just being a dick now.  He is being a dick.  Why do you look at that? 
[03:19:00]  Who would look at that picture?  I know.  Show me a, how about, here's a girl's asshole I just came in.  That's a, text me that.  Here's my Donkey Kong, really?  Here's your score?  He could probably do that.  You know, it's very, yeah.  It's so great that you actually said Donkey Kong, because Derek has actually pictured,  messaged me, uh, uh, a picture of, uh, original Donkey Kong cabinet, you know?  And the accompanying text is just, now I know where there's two.  Of course.  Well, there's two what?  Donkey Kong machines. 
[03:19:30]  What he ought to do is fucking text a picture of his liver and the sign it hung up that said  gone fishing.  Uh, let me go to Eric in Boston.  By the way, the volume coming out of your studio sucks, Travis.  I don't know if they hear it out there or not.  I think it's just, I think it's just in our headphones.  Huh?  I think it's just us.  Yeah, well, Mars got to fix that, because that's, uh, distracting.  Sorry.  That was inside shit.  Uh, Eric, what do you got, buddy?  Borderlands is a fantastic game.  Yeah?  I played Modern Warfare 2 and Borderlands, and it's kind of like the perfect amount of RPG 
[03:20:00]  for a first-person shooter, you know?  You don't have to do every single mission that they give you in the game.  Fucking awesome.  I want to, I want to know how it compares to, uh, Modern, uh, Warfare.  Mm.  Uh, I actually, I'm playing that more.  I played Modern Warfare 2 hardcore for a month or three weeks, and then I got into this.  It's awesome because there's checks in the game, and the guns in the game are randomly  made up.  So you can have a different sniper rifle with a different scope, fire rates, and whatnot. 
[03:20:30]  Every single gun in the game is different, so it's like, uh, hitting the lottery when  you pick a good gun.  Ah, very cool.  Cool.  Yeah, very, very great game.  Did you?  I love you guys.  Love the show.  Thank you.  Did you, uh, did you go to the Winter Classic?  No, I did not.  I wanted to fucking go in, in Sirius XM, uh, they, they, pfft.  Oh, you want to watch hockey in Fenway, uh, with, at two degrees?  No, no, no.  It was perfect.  See, you were in a casino.  It was like 34 degrees.  Oh.  No way. 
[03:21:00]  It was perfect.  It was nice.  It was nice.  It was a nice winter day to check out outdoor hockey.  Right.  Come on in.  You wouldn't check out outdoor hockey if you had a good seat?  No.  Too cold.  It's like regular hockey, but with no roof.  Yeah.  That's why I don't go to football games.  No different.  Freezing.  Well, Bob Costas made it, uh, very different.  Did he?  Yes.  Punch it out, guys.  Going for the moments, once again, yeah.  Uh, Borderlands is better than Modern Warfare 2, Ant.  That's what's coming in a little bit.  Oh, wow.  A little bit here and there.  So back to Elizabeth Hasselbeck.  Yeah, so I read the fucking book when we were off the air for two years. 
[03:21:30]  And it's the, it's the most, it's horrendous.  Is it really?  This, this girl dies a horrible death by a stalker dude.  Yeah.  And then she's in a basement or in a, in a cellar or something.  They find, I don't know, I'm not sure if they find the body.  It's been too long.  I saw the trailer for the movie.  And then she fucking solves her own, her own murder from, from beyond.  Yeah.  Using like his father or something.  It's a horrible, it's, it's a horribly depressing book.  And I can't imagine the movie's any better.  Is she a little girl?  Did you say that?  I'm sorry.  I heard by some part of that. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I don't kill him.  In the book, I think she's, uh, I want to say.  She's like 11 in the movie.  I think she's about that.  Maybe 12 or 13 in the book.  Oh, is that in the trailer?  It says, Daddy needed help or something?  Yes.  Oh yeah, I saw it, I saw a trailer for it.  Is Alan all in it?  Is Marky Mark in there?  Yeah, Marky Mark.  I think Marky Mark in the Funky Punch.  Yeah.  He pretty much takes you out of every movie.  Does he?  I know he calls the show, but he's Marky Mark as soon as you see him.  I kind of like, uh, the Mark Wahlberg. 
[03:22:30]  Which one did you like?  I liked, uh, the, uh, one with the, uh, Leonardo DiCaprio.  That was, uh, the, uh, oh my God, the Scorsese finally won the Oscar.  That was his brother though, wasn't it?  The Departed?  I have no idea.  Was he in that one?  I don't know.  It was a Wahlberg.  That was Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg.  No, it was not Don, it was Mark, you're right.  No, it was Mark Wahlberg.  Mark Sheen was the best thing in that movie.  So anyway, um, Elizabeth, uh, Hasselbeck asked Stanley Tucci if his wife has seen The Lovely  Bones. 
[03:23:00]  Innocent enough, right?  Uh-huh.  This is a major fail here.  Oh.  Did you read, had you read the book?  No.  No.  I hadn't read the book.  You read the book?  Yeah.  I had not read the book.  I read the script for, my wife had read the book.  Right.  And she said, the first thing she said was, you can't do that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And she might have been right.  I don't know.  No.  But, but it, no, I, then I read the script.  And then later I read the book.  But I couldn't, I couldn't almost focus on the entire book in its entirety.  It's too painful.  Has she seen, has she seen any parts of it?  No. 
[03:23:30]  No.  Well, you know, can I just ask something?  See, what you don't get to hear there, Elizabeth, uh, dumbass, asked Stanley Tucci if his wife  has seen The Lovely Bones.  Well, she didn't see the, the movie The Lovely Bones because she's dead.  She died of cancer.  Holy shit.  You stupid whore.  Oh, wow.  Okay, let me hear that again because now in context, I want to hear how he, how he reacts  to that.  You want the whole clip?  Yeah, well, enough of it. 
[03:24:00]  I don't want to give it away, but yeah, his wife died of cancer last spring.  Did you read, had you read the book?  No.  No.  I hadn't read the book.  I had not.  You read the, you read the book?  Yeah.  I had not read the book.  I read the script for, my wife had read the book.  Right.  And she said, the first thing she said was, you can't do that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And she might have been right.  I don't know, but, but it, no, I, then I read the script and then later I read the  book, but I couldn't, I couldn't almost focus on the entire book in its entirety.  It's too painful.  Has she seen it?  Has she seen any parts of it? 
[03:24:30]  No.  No, no, no.  Well, you know, can I just say.  No, uh, uh, no.  Well, he kind of brought up the wife first.  I was just going to say, unless you knew that, he did make it seem like I wouldn't have  known his wife was dead either from the way he said it.  No, he should have said, you know, before she passed on, she said blah, blah, blah.  And that would have been like.  A clue?  Yeah.  So, did she see it?  No, dummy, she's dead.  She died.  You're kidding.  How did it happen?  Oh, see.  What happened?  Stanley told she.  She had, uh, cancer.  What happened? 
[03:25:00]  She had cancer.  Oh, my God.  Died.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, that's, uh.  Well, you know, we were just talking about, um.  That's watch box and games.  Someone's searching for something.  Who's watching this?  So, Stanley, did she see the movie or any part of it?  No, she's dead.  What happened?  What happened?  Victim of the modern age. 
[03:25:30]  Pull, pull.  Oh, yes.  Victim of the modern age.  Let's start with the first clip.  I got the second clip.  You go with the third clip.  Okay.  Uh, so did your wife see the movie or any part of it?  No, she's dead.  What happened?  Victim of the modern age.  Pull, pull, girl.  Yeah.  And scene.  We were just doing a scene there.  I know it didn't work. 
[03:26:00]  I'm not that stupid.  Uh, we have a kid, uh, freaking out because he got an Xbox.  Call me off for what?  For Christmas.  Xbox 360!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  I thought you'd never come! 
[03:26:30]  Sounds like me introing Ozzy.  Please, right when he turns it on, Red Ring of Death.  Would that be great?  You little fucker!  Is there a video of that?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Let's see.  How old is he?  He's a little tyke.  He's like...  Of about seven.  He's kind of like Potsy Webber.  Oh, my God! 
[03:27:00]  Oh, my God!  Kids are so stupid.  Oh, my God!  I thought you'd never come!  Oh, my God!  Yeah, you're going crazy.  That's why I say to girls and I'm going down on them.  Oh, my God.  I thought you'd never come.  That's the best way to react to when a girl shows you her tits.  Just scream and yell at them. 
[03:27:30]  Get on the floor and do the curly run.  That dog's freaking out.  Yeah.  Goes on and on.  It lost his little fucking mind.  That's great.  And then the obligatory, you know, the second half of the video is the entire first half,  but just in slow motion.  It's not exactly David at the dentist.  I don't know.  Some kid's family, they have a shitty TV in the back. 
[03:28:00]  Like, what year is this, 1986?  Yeah, he's going to play it on that piece of TV.  He's going to play it on a 13-inch tube TV.  Like Sam's house.  Even his dog is hacky and old.  I hate this fucking family.  I hope right after that, the fucking, like, right after, as he's plugging his Xbox,  old Rex ran out and was struck by a delivery truck.  Like, I hope the fucking, I hope, I hope the golden-haired dog in that video now has  a fucking tire print to his back.  And the dog did the little half-curly run, except his innards and shit were coming out 
[03:28:30]  of his stomach.  Christmas is spoiled!  Why can't you just be happy for the kid?  They have to use the Xbox to pick up the dog by the hind legs and put his fucking, his  lower half, his tendrils, in the fucking box that his toy came in.  His tendrils.  Just spies that dog, barking happily.  Right after that, I hope it ran through the fucking dog door to alert the neighbors that 
[03:29:00]  his master had gotten the Xbox.  And a fucking, like, a delivery truck just fucking plowed into him.  One tire over the ears and one over the back of the legs.  Holy shit.  The kid's horror, as he just hears from outside.  Every time he plays that Xbox, he'll have to think of brains and shit on the fucking tip  of his white shell-toed divas.  He scooped up Rex's fucking most private areas. 
[03:29:30]  That little pink lipstick they found two days later.  Because the dog's dick was hard.  The dog was so happy that he got the Xbox.  He ran out of the house with a hard dick.  So when the truck ran it over, that little lipstick went and shot off the front of his  body.  The neighbor found it stuck to the mailbox.  I think this might belong to you.  I don't know what to do with it. 
[03:30:00]  My cat was knocking it around laughing.  My cat was twittering pictures of this.  You have a wild imagination, my friend.  Holy shit.  Fucking dog dick stuck to the frozen fucking mailbox.  Bet you thought they had a letter because...  Because...  Jesus.  Jesus. 
[03:30:30]  Holy shit.  You're despicable.  You're just not a good person.  I am.  Holy shit.  Oh my god.  Jesus, Jimmy.  The flag is on. 
[03:31:00]  Little wrist.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Oh fuck, man.  Bravo.  You know what?  He knew that Dave was going to fire up like that too.  Because it was so hard.  He was so happy.  When the dog saw the Xbox, you'd hear him getting excited.  His little paws were going.  His weenie stood up and he didn't know why.  Holy shit. 
[03:31:30]  Oh fuck, man.  You know what?  Let's call it.  Yeah, that was a...  There's no way we're beating that.  That's a great out, motherfucker.  Let's call it.  Fuck it.  Jimmy, are you promoting anything?  Oh, God.  Addison Improv.  My return to the Dallas area.  It's been like well over a year and a half, I think.  Oh, fuck.  I used to love going there with you.  Love that gig, man.  This Thursday, Friday, Saturday, I will be at the Addison Improv in Addison, Texas.  Fuck.  I love Dallas.  Go see Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[03:32:00]  Go see me.  It kills me.  I'm going to fucking be laughing at all fucking things.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  The neighbor calls the father.  We have something we think is yours.  He's so distracted, he's like holding it, and then the phone rings, and he puts it behind  his ear.  And he forgets his dad until it thaws out.  His dog pre-cum on his ear.  He's like, oh no.  I don't know why my glasses have been slipping off.  What?  What a bad boy that kid is. 
[03:32:30]  It's horrible.  Oh, shit.  Alright.  Alright, man.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Later.  I'm going to be back.  Hit it. </pre>
