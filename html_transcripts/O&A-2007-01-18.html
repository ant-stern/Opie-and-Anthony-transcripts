<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting rapidly between segments.  It began with a discussion of a New York City antique shop owner suing a homeless man for $1 million for allegedly deterring customers.  The hosts described the homeless man's behavior as erratic and unsanitary, sharing their own anecdotes about encounters with homeless individuals near their apartment, including one memorable individual wearing women's lingerie.  This segment transitioned into a lengthy discussion of the "Hold Your Wee for a Wii" contest, which resulted in a contestant's death from water intoxication.  The hosts played audio recordings from the contest, revealing moments where the potential dangers were discussed and dismissed.  The fallout, including the firing of ten employees and the possibility of manslaughter charges, was also extensively covered.

The show then delved into a discussion of a different radio contest, "The Morning Rave," which also involved excessive water consumption and resulted in the death of a contestant, Jennifer.  Audio clips from the contest were played, featuring Jennifer's voice as her condition worsened.  Trish the Dish, Manny (or possibly a different Manny), Lucas, and Fester (who was present in the studio) were mentioned as being involved.  Listeners and lawyers, Jonathan and Steve, called in to discuss the legal ramifications, focusing on potential charges of criminal negligence and involuntary manslaughter, with Steve clarifying that waivers do not protect against criminal prosecution.  The hosts also discussed previous controversial stunts from the show.

A significant portion of the broadcast featured commentary on American Idol auditions, with the hosts making numerous offensive remarks about the contestants' appearances.  One segment involved a listener-submitted video of a contestant they referred to as "The Hotness."  A story about a midget sighting at an Atlantic City craps table was also shared.  Bill Burr's upcoming stand-up shows were advertised. The hosts interacted with their online PalTalk audience, including an incident involving a user, "baby girl," engaging in exhibitionism. A disastrous audition from a 27-year-old singer performing "Unchained Melody" was played, followed by a segment where E-Rock, a show employee, was forced to participate in a “Chubby Bunny” challenge, extensively documented on video.  The hosts interspersed this with a “CSI: David Caruso” parody and discussion of the cold weather affecting their XM broadcast.

The show included a phone interview on MSNBC concerning the death of the contestant from another radio show’s stunt. Opie and Anthony deflected blame, used offensive language, and repeatedly mentioned the "Frunkus incident."  The conversation transitioned to their past controversies and current success.  The band Octane performed two songs, "Enemy" and "Confessions," live in the studio.  The hosts frequently used vulgar and inappropriate language throughout.

A later segment featured a discussion about a fictional "Fluke Guy" in a Southern rock band, followed by an in-studio interview with Buck Angel, a transsexual porn performer.  The interview included graphic details about Buck's transition, career in pornography, AVN award, and personal life, including his marriage.  Jimmy Norton was mentioned as having met Buck.  The latter part of this segment returned to regular content, including weighing E-Rock and promoting Jimmy Norton's upcoming appearances.  Octane performed two more songs during the broadcast.  Finally,  the show also included commentary on rival radio host Ron Valeri and his boastful email, interspersed with insults; commentary on Barack Obama's presidential campaign and racial dynamics; and a humorous bit about Larry King confusing President Bush with President Kennedy, as well as Roseanne Barr's explanation of the internet to Larry King.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  If this doesn't make you want to throw out a failure, the most annoying thing on two legs, what a bore fest, who cares about the funny, just bring me the porn, aren't we dumb, hee hee, oh, do you want to play, Anthony, I will beat children about the head, Jim Northen, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore, it's indescribable, I'm trying, it's like a rape that's covered by insurance, some of the comments they make are uncalled, 
[00:00:30]  why are you crying, the virus finally hit a boat with Jimmy, you never know, it could be AIDS, no, yes, yes, it's the Opie and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A, and, I hate you, but enough of this palaver, let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Thud, thud, thud, I love that drum, thud, thud, thud.  I used to love this intro music, now I just realize, why so dramatic, why so dramatic?  Everything's so dramatic, wow, this is the music that says we're on, alert everybody, the Opie and Anthony show's about to broadcast, alert, good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, self important, I see a bunch of pal talkers just waking up for their day, that's it, good morning pal talkers. 
[00:01:30]  I gotta get the E-Rock cam up, there we go.  Isn't it weigh in day for him later?  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  I think the bit's over though. 
[00:02:00]  I think he lost a little weight, you can see it in his face or something.  He's also wearing black, that makes you look thinner.  He knows what he's doing.  He's all over this one.  He's not gonna be made the fool.  Yeah, we'll weigh him later though.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number's 1-866-313-3.  That's 1-866-313-3.  It is kind of cool to check out pal talk because you can tell people are setting their alarms to start their day with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  They're all right now just stretching and getting their morning coffee and...  Oh, and morning cigarette.  Jesus.  A morning cigarette.  You get to see the first glimpse of nudity.  Wow, my voice just changed like I'm 15 years old.  Can I point out how great it is that poor Eric loses a little weight and you go, alright, bit over.  He's actually starting to look good again.  Oh, it stinks.  Yeah, why give him acknowledgement of that?  We're not doing the bit to try to help him with his plight.  We're praying that he's gaining weight. 
[00:03:00]  Loses weight, who cares?  The fun is in the fact that he steps on the scale and he gained a pound or two and then we just point and laugh at him.  Yeah.  Then he lost some weight and bit over.  Yeah, we got lots to do this.  We really do.  Whoa.  You want to start with the front page of the paper?  Yeah, sure.  That annoys me.  Well, we were talking about how this annoys us and then we realized we were annoyed at the opposite ends of the spectrum on this one. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, but then people are going to think I'm like real liberal or something, but that's not what I'm getting at.  Basically, the front page of the New York Post is there's a hoity-toity antique shop.  Yes.  Carl Kemp and Associates Limited Anticues.  On the Upper East Side, a place that I would never hang out in.  Dude, it's called antiques.  Did you say Anticues?  I'm just heading the idiot off at the pass that writes that one in. 
[00:04:00]  So it's a hoity-toity.  You go in there and you pay $2,000 for something that some dead person used to own.  Lampshade made of skin, perhaps.  Some type of antique.  It's on the Upper East Side, which is just an area of New York City.  Carl Kemp.  And yeah, yeah.  What's his name?  Zell.  White Angel.  Carl Kemp.  Yeah, Carl Kemp.  Carl Kemp. 
[00:04:30]  Antiques.  He owns an antique store in a very, very rich Upper East Side neighborhood, I guess.  Yeah.  And, well, here's the deal.  Like I said, it's a hoity-toity shop.  People go in there and they spend a ridiculous amount of money on crap.  Old crap.  And, oh, they're doing the story on the news right now.  So, unfortunately for him, they show the front of the store.  Gold lettering.  Carl Kemp Antiques.  Huge picture window that shows the goods inside. 
[00:05:00]  And, unfortunately for him, centered right on his picture window is a grate in the street.  You see it there?  Yeah.  On the sidewalk.  Yeah.  And out of these grates usually pour heat.  And where there's heat, you will find the homeless.  Well, they've got to keep warm.  They try to keep warm over these grates that go down to the subway or wherever.  Con Ed access.  And there's a homeless guy.  And, obviously, the homeless guy has been hanging out there every night for a really long time. 
[00:05:30]  They stake their claim, these homeless people in New York City.  They have, like, territorial.  They're very territorial.  They get a spot that's good.  And they stay there until someone bigger and badder kicks them out of there.  And then, you know, that person gets a spot.  It's the law of the jungle out there.  Yeah, we've learned all this because we know more about the homeless than Mayor Menino.  Oh, we know everything about the homeless.  I know for a fact that they smell very bad.  I just know this through experience. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  By the way, Mayor Menino counted the homeless.  Has he done anything else since then?  Of course, we're talking about the mayor in Boston that had a big, huge problem with our homeless shopping spree.  Yeah, we took the homeless out shopping for Christmas.  We're going to be counting the homeless.  On a day where we count the homeless, they are taking them to a store and buying them.  All right, now what?  Now what?  You counted the homeless.  Now what?  Now what?  Now what?  Now what do you do?  They are counted.  So anyway, on this day that you count the homeless, I hope you count masculine homeless. 
[00:06:30]  Big tongue jerk.  I'd like to put a garret around his neck or garrot.  And remind me to talk about Ron Valeri, our old friend.  Why even bother?  Up there in Boston, showing his true colors.  What a dick.  Yeah, keep supporting Mantown.  Exactly.  And see where that gets you.  What a dick.  Oh, we got a little mission for the Pess. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  Hey.  Sounds like a little paranoia.  Our ratings are going up, up, up, up, up, up, up in Boston, right?  Mm-hmm.  But I'll be completely honest, Mantown's still kind of beating us here and there.  They have a little bit, just a tad bit of a head start on us, let's say.  How many years?  About 15?  Something like that, yeah.  Yeah.  A little bit of a head start.  And, you know, to the Boston listeners, you want to listen to the Mantown show, there's nothing we could do.  No. 
[00:07:30]  There's nothing we could do.  It's an awful, awful radio show.  Mm-hmm.  Ron Valeri knows it.  And so the latest ratings come out, and they're beating us in some demos.  So Ron Valeri's all excited.  He sends out a mass email to pretty much everybody that's ever worked in radio, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  Uh-huh.  And then at the end of the emails, just bragging about his stupid morning show beating us still in some demos.  It smells of paranoia.  It smells of paranoia. 
[00:08:00]  Keep your eyes open.  We're right behind you.  And he knows it.  He tried to hire us.  The guy tried to hire us.  He was the first guy.  Didn't he?  That, uh, well, no, I'm talking.  At one point?  Well, he did hire us back in the day.  Yeah.  When we moved out to Boston.  But when we were on Just Satellite Radio, he was the first guy that came our way trying to hire us.  Mm-hmm.  To work again at AAF.  And due afternoon.  Oh, no, it was going to be mornings. 
[00:08:30]  That's right.  They were going to boot, uh.  They were going to boot the Hillman.  They were going to boot him out and put us in there.  And I guess give them, you know, afternoons.  I don't know.  But, uh, yeah, that didn't happen.  We were, uh, contractually not allowed to do that at the time.  And, uh, he, now he's bashing us.  Yeah.  So, uh, Ron Valeri, who used to be a friend, he's now an enemy of the show.  Enemy of the show.  Uh, to the ONA pest, why don't you call the Hillman this morning and just, just ask him politely, 
[00:09:00]  is it true that, uh, Ron Valeri tried to hire Opie and Anthony to take your slot in mornings?  Right.  And see if, uh, see if he's going to be honest with you today.  So, Ron Valeri sends out this mass email and it just smells of paranoia.  Smells of paranoia.  Reeks.  We're right behind you, buddy.  We're right behind you.  Oh, I want to be behind Mantown.  Better there than in front of them bent over.  That's true.  If we can't...  Good point, sir.  Good point.  If we can't beat a radio show that their biggest bid is Mantown, you know what? 
[00:09:30]  Time to retire.  We can hang out and just be men.  Because you're so whipped.  Time to retire.  You've got to find a closet.  If we can't take care of this.  They do Looney Tunes Tuesday.  Ech!  Looney Tunes Tuesday!  I'd sooner have a water drinking contest.  No kidding.  I'll lose my job that way.  But anyway, Ron, got your email. 
[00:10:00]  It's kind of sad that your true colors are coming out, you dick.  And you want to play?  We're going to play in the coming weeks and months.  Trust me on that.  Trust me on that.  And your email just smelled of paranoia.  And why don't you go tell Hillman that, yes, you did give me a call and said,  I would like to hire you and Anthony.  How do we make this work?  We want to bring you back to WAF to do mornings.  Why don't you go march down the hall and tell Hillman that it's true?  Because that's going to create a little friction between you two. 
[00:10:30]  I don't think he'll do that.  Of course not.  Even though you're asking.  Well, the listeners will be calling up to Hillman today and ask.  You guys ask him.  Ask him.  And get a hold of Ron Valeri and ask him.  You want to be honest.  You want to be sending out these emails to everybody.  Well, let's play then.  Send him email.  Now we start playing.  Call him.  Anyway, backing up to the homeless situation.  So this guy, Carl Kemp and his antique shop up there on the Upper East Side. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, like Ann said, a grate that keeps the homeless warm.  A guy, I guess he's been hanging out.  That's his spot.  Yeah.  His little piece of New York.  That's it.  He's just grate in front of this hoity-toity antique shop.  And before you start wondering what type of homeless guy this is, this isn't the type that people like.  This isn't the type of homeless guy that he was working, had his family, and through losing his job and health benefits, he lost this, ended up in a shelter. 
[00:11:30]  And this guy is a lunatic.  Look at his face.  He's a crazy person.  He's adorable.  Adorable.  He looks like he can play Santa Claus.  Who are you kidding?  He looks like Tippy Tom.  He's the third Tippy Tom we've seen so far.  He looks like a cleaner Tippy Tom.  He looks like you put a red suit on, he can play Santa Claus at Macy's.  No.  Yes, look at him.  Look into those eyes.  I'll show you creepy, scary homeless guys. 
[00:12:00]  Just come to my apartment at four in the morning.  Well, you know something?  If he was sane and a sweet guy, maybe he wouldn't have this quote in the paper.  All right.  Let me get my...  Is this a real quote?  This is a real quote.  All right.  Go ahead.  Now, if he was sane, he might have been able to explain himself and say, you know, why he was homeless and why he's here and maybe garner a little sympathy with people.  But when asked about this situation, he said, leave me the **** alone, he grumbled. 
[00:12:30]  I don't want to be **** involved.  All right.  And later, the same man walked up to Kemp's store window after closing at about 6.20 and placed two bags of miscellaneous garbage on either side of the warm grate.  He got down in the fetal position and did not respond to further questioning.  He's crazy. 
[00:13:00]  He's one of these crazy New York homeless guys.  And apparently, Carl Kemp is upset with this.  So he's decided to take a unique little tack in this whole thing.  And finally, we get to the punchline here.  This guy, Carl Kemp, is suing the homeless guy, the homeless guy, for $1 million.  He's suing him for a million bucks for a driving customer.  He says the whole thing is because he drives customers away. 
[00:13:30]  Customers don't want to visit his store because they're intimidated or the bad smell coming off the homeless guy.  Not true.  It's so not true.  How is it not true?  Because when you live in New York, this is just part of what it is.  You're walking by homeless people all the time.  They're sleeping in front of stores.  You step over them to go into nice restaurants.  All this is going on in New York City all the time.  Well, he must not like him.  You live in New York.  You're used to this.  And he's suing for a million dollars, knowing that, you know, this guy, this homeless guy, 
[00:14:00]  ain't going to be able to defend against a million-dollar lawsuit.  And you're taking the side of Carl Kemp.  I just think that Giuliani tried to do this years ago.  They're crazy people roaming the streets.  They're not.  There's different types of homeless.  And people are mistaking these hard luck stories, people down on their luck, with the lunatic homeless. 
[00:14:30]  This guy is lunatic homeless.  This is a guy that perhaps will just take a cobblestone and smash someone on the back of the head someday for no apparent reason.  He's a crazy person.  Yeah.  So you like – you've commented in the past about homeless people outside your window keeping you awake when you used to sleep in the bedroom party.  Yeah, for the new listeners, I'm not an advocate of the homeless.  You know, if I see a homeless person, if I'm in a good mood, I'll give a few dollars. 
[00:15:00]  But I'm not, like, chasing down homeless people to try to take care of them or give them money every single time.  Some people, I basically look at them and go, get lost, get a job.  I am like that as well.  And other times, I'll give money.  It just depends on my mood that day.  But, yes, homeless guys sleep right outside my apartment.  Yeah.  And you said when you used to sleep in that room upstairs instead of downstairs in the rat basement.  Right, right.  You said you heard them rummaging through the garbage, getting in fights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it kept you up. 
[00:15:30]  It was annoying.  Well, I'm sorry, Kenny sees the homeless guy because he warns me every morning.  He's like, oh, he's out there today.  And he lays down a mattress and everything.  Isn't it annoying?  I just kind of walked past him, to be honest with you.  He's kind of creepy because he's a black, older homeless guy that wears women's lingerie.  Oh, the story turns sexy.  He wears women's lingerie?  Yeah.  That has been warm.  And for some bizarre reason, even though he's right outside my apartment, he doesn't really bother me. 
[00:16:00]  So I'm like, whatever.  I don't care.  Yeah, until one day.  Until one day.  Yeah, but I guess this homeless guy is leaving bodily functions behind.  Yeah, he's like doing his business in front of the guy.  This is this.  The guy's homeless, yet he has made this little space, this open air space in front of Carl Kemp's Antiques, his home.  And his home must include a bathroom.  So he uses the sidewalk in front of the place as a bathroom. 
[00:16:30]  But Carl Kemp doesn't own the sidewalk in front of his joint, does he?  Yeah, but I believe, you know, when the guy relieves himself in the little vestibule doorway there, that's probably a problem.  People go and you take a little sniff when you walk in and it smells like the subway.  So you have no problem with this ass suing the homeless guy for $1 million.  No, I think it's a unique, original solution. 
[00:17:00]  But this is what I hate about New York, these snobs.  These snobs who think they're better than everybody else.  You know, the Kemp family may have come to this country years ago with nothing but the change in their pocket when they came to Ellis Island.  And they've built this little empire, little antique store in a nice neighborhood.  But shouldn't he have the freedom to run a business without a stinky homeless man taking dumps in front of his business? 
[00:17:30]  Well, in the article, he says that he calls the police.  The police come by.  They remove the homeless guy.  And then, unfortunately, the homeless guy comes back 10 minutes later.  So if you're Carl Kemp, just keep calling the police over and over again.  And then, you know what?  The police will do something.  But to sue this guy for $1 million is just ridiculous.  And I think one of our listeners should go down there and take a dump in front of Carl Kemp's store.  Oh, no.  I'll tell you what the police do.  You call the police and keep calling them to take the homeless away?  The police get mad at you. 
[00:18:00]  Believe me, I've been on some ride-alongs.  And the police get mad at the person making the call 20 times to do the same thing, to remove the homeless guy.  So they finally say, look, there's nothing we can do about this.  And if you make a call again, I'm going to take you in.  Well, I hope the homeless get together.  And that was almost verbatim.  Well, I hope the homeless get together.  Now you get five or six guys sleeping in front of this store every night.  Oh, you think they might organize?  I hope so.  How about you organize with some two-by-fours and a hammer and make a house, you lazy bastards? 
[00:18:30]  They don't want a house.  They're happy.  They don't.  Some of these guys are happy living on the streets.  We've learned that, too.  They're not happy.  They're crazy.  And if there was a single moment of clarity, they would realize that they just don't want to be in the situation they're in.  So, Jimmy, where are you at on this?  I kind of agree with both of you.  You're both right.  Oh, thanks.  Middle-of-the-road ass.  I do, but it's like he's right that there are snooty people like this Kemp guy who is an ass. 
[00:19:00]  And then again, I just think it's kind of funny that there's an old man.  He's old, and he's in front of an antique store.  And we're like, beat it, bum.  This lamp is more important than you are.  Yeah, see?  The sad truth.  See, Jimmy lives in New York.  He understands.  There's so many of these snobs in this city.  How is it snobby to want to run a business?  Who thinks their crap doesn't stink?  No, but the homeless guys does, and that's the problem.  True.  How is it snobby to want to run a business without having that? 
[00:19:30]  Hold on.  The snobby part, I get it, that maybe this is hurting business to a point, and something has to be done.  I get that part.  But the snobby part is having the nerve to actually sue a homeless guy for a million dollars.  The final recourse, I think.  It's his last little thing that he could think of.  It's like, what am I going to do?  I can't sue the guy.  Oh, wait.  I can.  As he jumps in his Mercedes and goes back to his really nice freaking...  I earned that Mercedes! 
[00:20:00]  Whatever.  Let's see.  I don't know about Carl Kemp, but I don't know if his money was given to him or he earned it.  Let's say hi to Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Yeah, by the way, that Kemp lives near Anthony, but when this bum starts pissing up F.H. Raleigh's front door, how are you going to feel then?  All right, there you go.  Well, how about F.H. Raleigh's in Huntington, right there on Main Street?  By the way, it's a fine restaurant.  Of course it is.  Owned by myself and my brothers.  Right.  400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington. 
[00:20:30]  The drinks will be flowing on Friday and Saturday night.  Of course.  You see me in there, I will buy you a drink.  And nary a homeless to be found out in front.  Although you might think they are because a lot of pests go down there.  Yeah, man.  You guys are wrecking the business.  Could you dress a little nicer, please?  We're trying to sell some meals in there.  Well, if there was a homeless guy in front of F.H. Raleigh's, I would kick him in the head.  You have to get rid of him.  Throw ice water on him. 
[00:21:00]  Now, I don't know if this guy has a personal vendetta against this homeless guy or if he truly is in some way, shape, or form through his excrement chasing away business.  Right.  But, you know, as a business owner, if there was a homeless person and you felt he was interfering with your business.  Right.  And there was nothing you could really do about it, I think you'd probably be a little pissed at him.  Could be.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't imagine that it's actually hurting business. 
[00:21:30]  It's more of a nuisance for this guy personally.  San Francisco has the worst homeless problem.  Oh, wow.  They're very liberal.  They're so liberal that it's getting the best of them.  There's homeless people outside all these really nice restaurants and people, I've watched them.  That's why I said this earlier.  They actually step over these really, really down and out homeless guys to get into these fancy, fancy restaurants.  When you're a city that really caters to and takes care of the homeless, you are destined to become a destination for the homeless. 
[00:22:00]  When I say take care of the homeless, again, I don't mean taking care of the family man that was down on his luck or the single mother who's got kids and is in a shelter and had a job and really wants to pull herself out of that.  It's a different story.  Those people can be helped and should be helped because eventually they'll be productive members of society.  These people are mental patients. 
[00:22:30]  It is like you open the door to Bellevue or any other mental institution in any big city and let the craziest of crazy people out on the street.  Well, they actually did that back in the day.  That's what they are.  They closed down a lot of those facilities and those people ended up on the streets.  Those are homeless people, too.  They have the same label, homeless, as the person that's in a shelter trying to get their life together.  But they are two completely different things.  And this type of homeless, I really don't have much sympathy for. 
[00:23:00]  This guy, he's not hurting anyone.  He's not going to hurt a soul, this guy.  This guy, out of nowhere, pushed people in front of subway trains.  Out of nowhere, they pick up a cobblestone or a Belgian block and clobber some dumb tourist over their head.  You're seeing it happen.  It doesn't happen a lot.  I'm not saying it's an epidemic.  But it's this type of crazy person that does it.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  We've got lots to do, by the way.  We have in our possession audio. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  From the Hold Your We for a We contest.  We've been talking about this for the last few days.  This is fantastic.  It's telling.  It's haunting.  It's like a – it's grotesque almost to listen to.  I haven't heard it.  We have actual audio of the woman that ended up dying.  Foreshadowing is going on during it.  From this radio contest in Sacramento.  Brutal.  When you know – obviously, you know what happened.  They had a contest.  People drank a lot of water to win a wee. 
[00:24:00]  You've got to hold your wee for a wee was the name of the contest.  And a woman died of water – apparent water intoxication.  They're still doing autopsies and stuff.  But you listen to this audio and knowing what happened, everything they're saying is like,  oh, oh, God, that's brutal.  Oh, no.  Oh, you shouldn't have said that.  Oh, what are you doing?  Oh, you knew this.  Oh, someone called and said that.  So it's really painful.  And what about Carter and Fester? 
[00:24:30]  I don't see what they had to do with it.  Justice for Carter and Fester.  All right.  Very good.  Apparently they were involved.  The Opie and Anthony show, you've got to listen a little longer than most radio shows.  Linger longer.  You've got to linger longer because –  Water doodle.  We start all sorts of subjects and stories, and we go back to this story.  We start a new one, then we go back to the – you know.  We're going to do a contest where people drink water, drink water, and then we drag them behind trucks.  Hello.  Hey, what?  It's on.  I'm fired. 
[00:25:00]  Ten people fired.  All right.  So we got that.  The Grise.  We got that audio we'll play very, very soon.  Her brain's not bone dry, bone dry.  Swelled up.  It is haunting audio.  Haunting.  In honor of the homeless guy who's being sued for a million dollars, let's play Gray Wolf.  This is one of our homeless friends.  Someone that pulled himself up by his bootstrap – by his moccasin straps. 
[00:25:30]  Well, he was definitely very homeless when he wrote this little song for his homeless friend, Tippi Tom.  Off the cuff, he came up with this on the spot.  This is called Shelter Me on the Opie and Anthony show.  See how this comes out.  All right.  They're right there.  All right.  Here we go.  This is a story about a man. 
[00:26:00]  And he always was so lonely at night.  But his voice is rowdy.  You can hear it all through this train station.  And I'm going to sing this one.  This is about Tippi Toe Tommy.  Let's go.  While we're young.  While we're young.  It's late at night.  And I have nowhere to go. 
[00:26:30]  My money's gone and off for all my friends.  And the cop says to me,  Hey, you smell bad.  Get out of here.  And he says,  And you know I have an angel.  And he says,  That ain't you.  Shelter me from the falling rain.  Wait, you have bones.  This is my life. 
[00:27:00]  I'm living with so much pain.  That's just a little piece.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[00:27:30]  O&A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio.  Starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:28:00]  Good morning.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We got instant feedback.  You go to OpieandAnthony.com.  There's a little thing you can click on.  Comment about what we're talking about on the show.  And some of your comments make the air.  And what the hell.  We'll give some air time to Carl from New Jersey.  Carl.  One of my many haters, by the way.  Oh.  Opie, don't try to sympathize with what homeless people have to go through, a-hole. 
[00:28:30]  You're the dick that stomped on that homeless dude's cake and thought it was the funniest thing ever.  What?  You're an effing douchebag.  Do I have to explain that again?  Yeah, I did think it was funny.  I laughed my ass off.  These guys laughed their asses off.  Andrew is amongst the luckiest homeless around.  He's a blithering idiot that he didn't show up for the homeless shopping spree.  But when crowds of 50 people at a clip walk past him. 
[00:29:00]  Every day.  When we do the walk.  And throw at least $5, $10.  And a lot of people throw $20 in his cup.  He's getting a day's, probably a week's worth of homeless guy begging money in five minutes.  Is it safe to say that he was getting about $100 a day at the height of his popularity with this radio show?  At least.  See, he wasn't just some homeless guy on the street, Carl. 
[00:29:30]  Pouring gas on him and lighting him on fire, you dick.  He became part of our show.  Yeah.  And he was paid handsomely as far as a homeless guy goes for it.  Handsomely.  He got more money than some of the guys that work for us, matter of fact.  The squishing of his cake was of entertainment value and it was paid for.  Don't worry about him so much, Carl.  By the way, the video's up on YouTube.  Yeah, check it out.  It's disgusting.  Throw Cake Stomp Opie and Anthony into the search and enjoy the hilarity. 
[00:30:00]  Is there another Cake Stomp?  I don't know.  You never know with YouTube, though.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe it's confused.  Can you imagine there's a hundred of them out there like, damn, I thought I was being original.  What the hell?  All right.  Really fast.  Listen to this.  It's all about Obama.  We all know it's all about Obama.  Obama, yes!  All right.  Get on the Obama train, will you?  I can't.  Why?  Because it ain't going to happen.  It's a useless vote. 
[00:30:30]  It is a useless vote.  And again, if I have to vote Republican because the Democrats can't come up with a real non-comedy ticket,  I'll vote Republican again.  What if Obama had an entire white staff?  Who are they?  See, well, he has an entire black staff, and I think that's what's going to hurt him a little bit as well.  Because you've got to warm up whitey a little bit to the idea that we might have a black president. 
[00:31:00]  He better start warming up middle America.  What is it going to take?  It's going to be a problem.  We discussed this yesterday.  What is it going to take?  A white man.  A white man that is kind of middle of the road, not liberal, not a crazy liberal, not a crazy conservative,  but a Democrat that isn't completely liberal on everything, that follows that Democratic friggin' line right down. 
[00:31:30]  And just like the Republicans follow that stupid conservative line on everything.  You can't make up your own mind on individual issues.  You've got to buy the whole ticket.  Enough.  So if, you know, there's some guy like that, he'll be voted in.  Well, he was on Larry King recently.  Yeah.  And by the way, this clip's not about Obama.  No.  Larry King asks Obama a question.  Uh-huh.  It's the question or the statement that Larry King makes that is very interesting.  I was just saying it in a little Obama talk. 
[00:32:00]  Of course.  It doesn't mean crap to it as far as what we're about to play here.  I do have the answer, by the way, for the type of black man that would win presidency.  It's not an all-black staff, but he should be forced to address all white people the way Morgan Freeman addressed Jessica Tandy in driving the station.  With that same reverence and love.  That could help.  I don't think his middle name of Hussein helps either, to tell you the truth.  I know what's in a name.  A rose by any other name.  A f*** by any other. 
[00:32:30]  You can't have the name Hussein in this day and age and become president.  We can't have a president where the name Hussein comes into play.  Why couldn't Barack Obama be a candidate for the 1984 presidency?  Why did it have to be this one with Osama still out there?  Osama Bin Laden's out there, so his name sounds like Osama.  Saddam Hussein.  His middle name is Hussein.  Who the hell am I voting for?  It's ridiculous. 
[00:33:00]  His last name should be Hitler.  Yeah.  Pete Hitler.  Pete Hitler would win.  And we all know.  We all know, including the people listening to us right now, that America in general is filled with a bunch of dummies.  For the most part.  They're going to get very confused, and they're going to really believe that they're voting for Osama.  Osama Bin Laden Hussein is running for what?  I'm not pulling that lever.  It probably releases anthrax.  Right.  All right.  Listen to this from Larry King. 
[00:33:30]  Just another classic, classic soundbite from Larry King.  Ben, we will be with them as partners, but this is not something in which we can simply impose a military solution.  President Kennedy wants congressional consent for this troop increase.  You support that?  Well, my office is looking at a variety of options to place some conditions on the president's actions.  Who? 
[00:34:00]  President Kennedy.  Did he refer to President Bush as President Kennedy?  Yeah.  And unfortunately, Obama didn't even.  Obama should have picked up on Larry.  Didn't even pause.  You doddering old fool.  It's time to retire.  President Kennedy.  What do you think about his troop increase in the NAMM?  Larry.  Larry, hello.  It's 2007.  2007, Larry. 
[00:34:30]  What are you talking about?  The New Deal.  Are you for it?  Or again it?  What about it?  The New Deal.  That Woody Wilson.  He's a madman.  Obama, your comments.  Right.  Obama, how do you feel about the Whig Party?  You think you can hold them off in this upcoming election?  Sarah, connect me to Chicago. 
[00:35:00]  We have a caller.  Let me climb the telephone pole and talk to him.  We have another call coming in over the humming wires.  Stupid Larry King.  President Kennedy.  Obama, what's going to be done with all that land now that we've made the Louisiana Purchase?  Got a good deal on that from what I hear. 
[00:35:30]  Right.  President Kennedy.  Do you think he could win all 32 states?  What a dope.  He was off by one party in 45 years.  What an S.  Let's go to a Western Union from Bill in Texas.  Larry, stop.  What do you think about the railroads meeting coast-to-coast stop? 
[00:36:00]  Golden spike.  A waste of money?  What do you think, Obama?  Wow.  Remember to post your letters to Larry King so the Pony Express could pick it up and deliver it to me.  We were writing that one down.  Ben had that one for you.  Someone is writing on the instant feedback. 
[00:36:30]  Big Duties, Jay.  He's a faithful listener from Jersey.  Holy ass, Larry King can speak with the dead.  Yeah, that's what he's doing.  Man, I was speaking with President Lincoln the other day.  But why President?  You know, he needs this crap like he needs a hole in the head.  Why President Kennedy?  What slip-up was that?  How do you slip that bad?  It's not even in the ballpark.  In even a ballpark. 
[00:37:00]  You want to hear that again real fast?  Yeah, I got to hear it.  All right.  How naturally he says it and doesn't even realize he said it.  Obama didn't realize.  Or maybe he did and he didn't.  And he's just being polite.  Don't be polite.  Point him out.  That's probably it.  He was being polite.  He knew what he meant.  But man, I mean, you and I would just be like...  Oh.  What?  It's like you meant six presidents later or something like that?  Yeah.  This is not something in which we can simply impose a military solution.  President Kennedy wants congressional consent for this troop increase. 
[00:37:30]  You support that?  So matter of fact, too.  Oh, my God.  Wait, Obama.  Sad news just in.  He's been shot in Dallas.  This...  Oh, my goodness.  Kennedy's been shot.  What a tool.  Obama, do you get cable in that cave?  He doesn't even know who he's talking to.  Obama. 
[00:38:00]  Maybe he meant Senator Kennedy?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Did he even end?  No, he said President Kennedy, didn't he?  Oh, yeah.  He said President Kennedy.  I just started heating up like, oh, boy, we're going to be looked like idiots.  No.  No, he screwed up.  President Kennedy.  Well, all right.  Well, that's just a little quickie.  And, of course, if we're talking about Larry King, we've got to just play this really fast.  It's a quickie, but it's one of our faves of all time.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles. 
[00:38:30]  They're back together, their first live get-together in five years.  The Motley crew.  The Motley crew are back.  I didn't even know they were gone.  The Motley crew.  Ladies and gentlemen, the Benny Goodman.  We got a phone call here from Mr. Jack Ruby.  Jack Ruby, you're on.  Oh, no. 
[00:39:00]  The Motley crew.  And then, yeah, this is a good one, too.  We haven't played in a while.  Roseanne Barr explains the Internet to Larry King.  I still call her Roseanne Barr, by the way.  The Internet as a political medium.  Viable?  Oh, yeah, it's like the only one left.  Idiot.  Absolutely, and that's not just me saying it.  That's everybody saying it.  Well, there's 80 billion things on it.  Yeah, but if you know where to look, you know, it all can come together.  When you're looking for the particular information that you're looking for, 
[00:39:30]  after you do the big search, this is what I found out by going on there,  it just takes your mind and then you live in there forever.  You can never come out.  Never gone searching.  Oh, my God, it just opens up the whole universe.  It's so awesome.  You would love it.  Anything you want to know.  The wife loves it.  I wouldn't love it.  What do you punch the little buttons and things?  You just click on this thing, but then you've got to be able to read.  So you have to have strong glasses when you're over 50.  And then you just scroll down and click. 
[00:40:00]  Scroll?  It's not that hard.  I can show you how to do it.  Like the Dead Sea Scrolls?  I'll be reading those tomorrow.  They're relevant.  How are you on CNN every night?  What is the Internet?  You push some buttons and pull levers?  It sounds like an episode of Lost in Space.  Right.  What is he talking about?  You push buttons and levers, and I hear these tapes go spinning and spinning.  How does he get his job done without using the Internet? 
[00:40:30]  Flashing lights and blooping sounds.  It's the Internet.  You get information.  The information you can pull off the Internet is better than any you can get anywhere,  as long as, like Roseanne was saying, you know where to look, how to decipher the real stuff from the bull crap,  and then you can form your own opinion based on a lot of other people's input.  And shouldn't he know about that?  Not even if he could say, no, I don't use it.  I know about it.  I've tried. 
[00:41:00]  I've used it.  But I don't want to push buttons.  Yeah, he's scared of the Internet.  Ah, frightened of it.  We, uh.  Someone sent me something once, and it looked like a car commercial.  So I watched it, and then a scary face went, ah!  And I had my volume up loud, and I refused to open another one of those emails.  I haven't slept since.  By the way, those scare the crap out of me.  I'm a sap for those things.  Oh, do I hate those?  I was in my office, and it said, cute kittens.  So I turned it up real loud. 
[00:41:30]  And I love kittens, so.  Back in the day, as Ted Turner was walking through.  Right.  So I turned up the volume, because it said, turn up the volume, you're going to see some  cute kittens.  And they were adorable.  They really were.  Right up until the loud volume started yelling, the boss is the C word.  The boss is the C word.  And I didn't know how to turn it off.  The boss is the C word.  One of my favorites of all time, by the way.  You know, we'll be talking about the internet and Rutherford B. Hayes tomorrow on my show. 
[00:42:00]  Ever since I saw Tub Girl.  Tub Girl.  I haven't turned my computer on.  You push buttons.  My wife loves it.  She was talking about something called horse gag the other day.  She just watches it over and over.  Whenever I come over to take a look, though, she closes something.  I can't see it.  Oh, what an idiot. 
[00:42:30]  How could you be in media?  I don't care how old you are.  Stop it, old people.  Especially in the media.  This guy should be internet savvy.  Just for this show alone, I try to read about ten papers.  You know, all the basics like Chicago Sun-Times.  I get into the Philly papers, the Boston papers, the Washington papers, the New York papers.  I could go on.  Cleveland, Dallas.  All within a half hour, I could read about ten papers because it's on the internet.  What is he?  He's got to get all those papers delivered and thumb through it trying to find stuff. 
[00:43:00]  Not only that, yeah, you've got to go through all kinds of garbage in the newspapers, too, to get to the juicy stories.  There are many websites you could go to that just list, you know, a bunch of the top stories, the interesting things that people want to talk about, things like that.  He knows nothing of this?  Right.  The Motley Crue.  All right, let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  A lot of calls coming from Long Island today.  We love seeing that.  Hey there, Greg.  What's up, Greg?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Larry King, you've just got to ease up on him. 
[00:43:30]  He's just a little confused because both presidents don't have a brain in their head.  Both presidents.  Your call had potential, man, but you just didn't have any confidence.  What?  I get it because Kennedy had no brain because it was shot out of his head.  And Bush seems to have no brain.  And Bush because he's silly.  All right, Greg.  That's okay.  We'll let you slide.  My favorite part of that Larry King Motley Crue intro, I love the fact he calls him the Motley Crue,  but I also love the fact he goes, it's their first get-together.  Get-together. 
[00:44:00]  Get-together.  Get-together.  Larry, you know what these guys used to do?  Playing a concerto for you, a get-together.  They used to bang broads and then take tacos and let's just say wash so they wouldn't get caught for cheating by the women they were going on at the time.  They would wash themselves with burritos and tacos and Mexican food that was available around the corner from the house they all lived in.  Get-together.  These guys used to, like, do heroin together.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  You know, one of them died with a needle in his arm and was brought back to life.  Right.  Get-together.  A little coffee clutch.  Steven asks from Bayshore, Larry wants to know what's with that lonely girl 15.  Now I do dig her on the YouTube.  She's adorable.  It would be great if we found out Larry was an internet predator. 
[00:45:00]  Larry King, you've come to this house for sex.  Hi, it's LK1065.  How are you?  13.  Here are some pictures of me.  I know how to send pictures.  Nude.  Maybe that's why he's going on a show claiming he has no clue about the internet.  I know nothing about this, and please don't look at my hard drive.  Loaded with pictures of that cute Dakota fanning. 
[00:45:30]  I've got mail.  I know what that means.  Oh, boy, they're coming in.  Will trade pics of same.  Oh, whoa, whoa.  There's a house in the suburbs.  You want me to come over and visit?  Bring some Zima and condoms?  Okay.  I'm in.  See you there. 
[00:46:00]  I'm 28 years old.  I know you.  You're Chris Hansen from Dateline.  What are you doing here?  I'm banging this broad.  You won't believe who came into our house next.  Larry King.  He thought we were having a get-together.  All right, Chris.  You know, the whole thing.  We work like the cops.  You know, that blue wall. 
[00:46:30]  Don't say anything, okay?  I'm leaving now.  You're free to go.  Get on the floor.  Get on the floor.  Oh, no.  The Keystone cops are after me.  Maybe if I run, they'll run in fast motion and I could give them a slip.  That's it.  Hey, sweetie, you want some garlic?  Here, drink some of this Welch's grape juice.  I spiked it with vodka. 
[00:47:00]  Just let me finish my cookie, Chris, and iced tea that the young lady poured me before you arrest me.  By the way, everyone's saying that he meant Senator Kennedy.  Oh, whatever.  We just, we got, you got 20 minutes of hilarity because of that.  I don't care if he meant Senator.  He said President.  Yeah.  You guys are jackass.  I was hoping he got the president wrong, too, but all right, whatever. 
[00:47:30]  When we return, and by the way, I've been saying for days that we would be dragged into the story.  The first article coming from the Mercury News, famous radio stunts gone bad.  Of course.  And we're under the category of death and churches.  Oof.  We'll get into that.  Of course, we're talking about the hold your we for a we contest that the morning rave did.  Uh, we got the actual audio of the contest, and I'm telling you right now, we are playing it next. 
[00:48:00]  I know at this point you don't believe me anymore, but I'm telling you, we will play it next.  Is this the clip where the radio show says aliens landed?  I heard that made quite a stir the other day.  We will play the audio from the actual contest that killed the listener next on the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony virus. 
[00:48:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Festivities.  What is this?  I like it.  Yeah, this is pretty cool.  I don't know.  I'll find out.  Other things people are talking about this morning.  Lindsay Lohan goes into rehab.  Whatever.  This was after, well, we had talked about crap like this, where the celebrity publicists always say it's exhaustion. 
[00:49:00]  She's like the poster girl for that.  The publicist saying it was exhaustion.  No, she'd been working very hard.  There were rumors in the paper a couple weeks back that she was drinking cranberry juice or something at a bar,  and they saw her pouring some clear liquid out of a flask into the cranberry juice.  Right, right, right.  And her publicist again was like, no, no, no.  She's, you know, on the straightened hour.  She's not drinking.  She's not doing anything.  And then all of a sudden, boom, they're in rehab. 
[00:49:30]  What happened?  Yeah, they just are professional liars, most of these publicists.  Yeah.  By the way, we got to send flowers to somebody.  Remind me.  We got to talk about that later.  A publicist?  Ah, we got to make good on something big time because of Jay Moore.  We'll get into it a little later this morning, but Jay Moore really, really effed us over bad.  I don't think he really meant to.  No, he didn't mean to.  He was going for a little shock, and it's hurt us to this day.  He was being Jay.  And I think we might have to have the Pest do a nice mission, a really nice mission, 
[00:50:00]  which is very rare for the ONA Pest.  I know it's rare.  I understand the mentality of the ONA Pest, but every once in a while,  they do the right thing, and I think we might ask them to do a nice mission.  A nice mission.  Have the cobra help the mongoose, is what you're saying.  It can't be done.  We'll get into it a little later because we promised the audio from the morning rave.  Also, cancer on the run.  Deaths from dreaded disease fall second year in a row. 
[00:50:30]  These people are smoking less, they're saying.  I think there's murders up.  I'm not a comedy thing.  I'm just commenting.  Murders up.  Yeah.  Killing people that might have gotten cancer.  But smoking is down as far as older people go, but I think it's making a comeback with  the youth.  Do you?  Of America.  Yeah.  What do the studies say?  Are you just saying that because you have a microphone?  It's the Greg O.B.  Hughes study.  Let me tell you another show that was doing a study and blurting out what they thought 
[00:51:00]  were facts.  Yeah.  The morning rave.  True.  All right.  Let's get into the morning rave.  You want to explain this once again, Anthony, for the people that maybe are listening to  us for the first time.  Under a rock?  Yeah.  This is a show in Sacramento called The Morning Rave.  They were on a station called The End and they had a contest.  Win a Wii.  Hold your Wii for a Wii.  It was one of these things where a bunch of contestants came in.  They had to drink a lot of water and hold it.  They weren't able to use the restroom. 
[00:51:30]  And the person that could hold it for the longest won a Wii, one of the very popular gaming  systems.  So it sounds innocent enough until you realize that people die from this, water intoxication.  It just throws off your body chemistry so badly that your brain cells start swelling and  you die.  I hear it's a really tough thing to do, though.  Every once in a while you get a fraternity guy dropping, but...  I think it really depends on your size.  It's like alcohol. 
[00:52:00]  It depends on your size, what you have in your body.  Did you eat?  Do you have enough sodium in your body, enough electrolytes in your body at the time?  Were you fasting to make more room for the water so now your defenses are down as far  as having the right chemicals in your body at that time?  And it sounds like maybe that's what happened to her.  So she drank a bunch of water.  She died.  Ten heads rolled over there at the station.  Ten people got fired.  The whole show got fired. 
[00:52:30]  Production staff, all the producers got fired.  And my God, Carter and Fester.  Poor Carter and Fester.  Poor Carter and Fester.  They're not even part of the morning game.  I don't even know who they are.  But I love their names.  I think they're another show on the station or were another show on the station.  If we ever, ever have to change our radio names, Opie, Carter and Fester, we're just  stealing those names.  Oh, because Opie and Anthony is just the coolest thing.  Ugh, I hate my name. 
[00:53:00]  Carter and Fester.  It's a nickname I got when I was 12, by the way.  Yeah.  And Anthony and I didn't get together and go, wow, here's a great radio name.  No.  But I'm stuck with it now that I'm 32.  To have your bank account, I wouldn't care if they called it the Edie Amin and Anthony  show.  I like Edie.  Did you see Last King of Scotland?  No, I was watching the English versions of The Office last night.  Very funny.  Laughing my ass off.  Hey, can we get the website for the morning, Ray? 
[00:53:30]  I want to see what the number one song is today.  Yesterday it was How to Save a Life by The Fray.  Well, because of what happened, obviously they weren't taking their own warnings.  And now there's audio of the show that this woman died doing.  And the jocks, there's a lot of foreshadowing, a lot of things that's said.  And in hindsight, you look back and go, oh boy, maybe you shouldn't have said that or 
[00:54:00]  done that.  Or there was this warning.  And that was like warnings were coming in.  Callers were calling with warnings about this.  So it's almost like when I listen to the St. Pat's audio, I'll think like, oh God,  don't go to the floor.  Yeah, here it comes.  Yeah, true.  You hope it'll change at some point and you'll wake up and things will be okay.  Hey, I'm on The End's website out there in Sacramento.  And they have a section called What's Hot.  What's Hot.  Well, we know what's hot as far as your station goes.  And then the last 10 songs played, they just got to stop. 
[00:54:30]  They just got to stop.  Number five, Where'd You Go?  Where'd You Go?  You can't write better stuff than this.  Number four, This Is How We Do It.  Number three, My Love by Justin Timberlake.  Number two, Blurry by Puddle of Mud.  Justin Timberlake inadvertently involved in this.  Oh, really?  Yeah, listen to the audio.  All right.  Number two is Blurry by Puddle of Mud.  And, well, number one is Call Me When You're Sober. 
[00:55:00]  So, maybe they should just get rid of that section of their website for a while.  Let's say hi to Steve in New York City.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up?  Well, you know, I thought it was interesting.  I had heard on the internet the radio.  On the what?  You heard on the what?  Exactly.  You know, one of the callers had called and said, you know, this might be a bad thing.  You could have water intoxication and you can die.  And both radio hosts laughed hysterically. 
[00:55:30]  Well, they kind of blew it off and didn't pay attention to it.  But Sacramento County Sheriff John McGinnis assigned to Homicide Detective Wednesday to investigate the apparent water intoxication death of this woman.  So, they might be brought up on manslaughter charges.  Wednesday morning, the time slot that had been filled by the morning rave was taken by a disc jockey known as Chris K.  He usually does the afternoon shift.  You know, that's a bittersweet thing. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  He jumped right in there.  Yeah, I'm the new morning guy.  Chris K with you in the mornings.  You'll be playing a lot of music because they don't want me to do anything.  They don't even want me talking.  They don't want me saying.  Actually, I'm a robot programmed by the PD.  Don't say a word.  As the investigation ramps up, McGinnis said detectives will explore whether charges are merited for involuntary manslaughter due to failure to render aid. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, you'll hear a little about that on the tape, too, where you think like, well, maybe at some point they should have, could have.  But again, hindsight, you don't know.  You don't think someone's going to die from it.  As I was reading some of this and listening to the audio last night at home, I was thinking, Jesus Christ, you know, you're just going into work to do a dopey show and manslaughter charges.  All of a sudden you have to worry that you might end up.  I doubt they're going to go through this and end up in jail.  I really do.  But just that whole thing of having to go through that, you know, you're just at work one day having a goofy radio show, especially that show. 
[00:57:00]  That show.  It sounds goofy.  Whoa, everybody.  Whoa.  How you doing?  What?  Uh, 10 years?  What?  I, but we were just doing a gag.  What happened?  Your Honor, I, what?  Like, how the hell does it go from that, you're having all kinds of fun, to they're investigating you on murder charges?  They have to feel like they've been hit with a sledgehammer. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  You got no job.  You could go to jail.  It's bad enough to just get fired.  We know that.  Just to get fired is bad enough.  And we've been talking to one of the, uh, Morning Rave, uh, people.  And, uh, we're getting close.  We might get him on our show.  I'd love to have that person on.  We're getting close.  We're getting close.  We'll see what happens.  We really want to know exactly what, what went on in that studio that, uh, that day.  And, um, a lot of people bring up the fact that they do sign waivers when they do this, but, uh, that doesn't necessarily protect you. 
[00:58:00]  You can't have somebody sign a waiver and then shoot them in the head and say, hey, they signed a waiver.  So I'm fine.  All right.  Want to get into this now?  Yes.  All right.  So here's the audio from the Morning Rave.  Uh, they're getting ready to do their, you know, hold your wee for a week.  Contest.  The first track, no one's shown up yet.  Fester will be drinking with the contestants.  Yeah.  So he was part of the contest as the goof factor.  He was the goofy guy involved.  Is he a fat guy?  Oh, yeah.  Fester's fat. 
[00:58:30]  Of course he is.  He's Fester.  Yeah.  Is he their stunt boy?  Could be.  Every Wacky Morning Show has to have stunt boy.  Fester's a mystery.  He's a mystery.  I, I don't know much about Fester.  I want to learn more about Fester.  And Carter, no clue about him.  And by the way, Carter and Fester weren't the guys, uh, that were,  were actually on the Morning Rave.  They were just helping out the Morning Rave.  Yeah.  Because you had Trish the Dish.  You had Manny, or Manny.  Manny, I think.  And Lucas.  Lucas.  All right.  So, uh, Fester will be drinking with the contestants. 
[00:59:00]  The Hole makes a joke about dying of water intoxication.  Yeah, this is really creepy to listen to, knowing what happened.  All right.  Has anybody showed up yet for the contest?  I'm not sure.  They should be arrested for the radio voices.  What?  They should be arrested for the radio voices.  Wow.  Bring them in.  Wow.  Has anybody showed up yet for the contest?  I'm not sure.  We told them to be here by 6 a.m.  And then at 6 a.m., we're going to rally them all together.  Starting at 6.15, they're going to start drinking their water.  Yes, the water's here. 
[00:59:30]  Fester's here.  He's going to drink with them.  Oh, good.  Fester, you, did you drink?  And there's Fester at the webcam.  How much water do you think you can drink before you have to wee?  We're going to be drinking, like.  When I do that, I do, like, two gallons.  Two gallons?  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and, like, die?  No water.  Your body is 98%.  Wait, what?  She's like, can't you get water poisoning and die?  That was Trish.  Trish the dish kind of knew.  Trish does not go to jail. 
[01:00:00]  No, Trish should go to jail because she's the one that knew  and should have known you don't, you could die from it.  And she is an expert because she has a microphone in front of her.  Of course.  I'll wait until you hear some of the expert lines that come out  just because they have microphones in front of them.  Wait.  Allen?  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and, like, die?  No water.  I can't believe that was said.  I'm hearing this for the first time, by the way.  Yeah, me too.  And that is exactly what happened.  Oh, wow. 
[01:00:30]  Wow.  Oh, dude.  Can't you get water poisoning and, like, die?  No water.  Your body is 98% water.  Why can't you take in as much water as you want?  I don't know.  Because that poor kid is at college.  I know.  That's what I was thinking.  Yeah, well, he was doing other things.  Maybe we should have researched this.  I don't know.  I think what they were touching on.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they were touching on one of those fraternity hazings where a kid died from water intoxication,  and they kind of brought that up and said, well, he was doing other things. 
[01:01:00]  Drinking.  Yeah, drinking water.  Right, right.  Yes, and dying.  And dying, yes, of course.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  This is really interesting.  A little eerie.  I know.  That's what I was thinking.  Yeah, well, he was doing other things.  Maybe we should have researched this before.  I don't know.  I mean, yeah, we never do this before I start doing something.  Once you know I break out in hives, I'm in an ambulance.  If it gets dangerous for somebody, their body will automatically throw it up.  And if you throw up the water, you're out of the contest.  Ah, he knows. 
[01:01:30]  All right, well, there you go.  See, was that Dr. Maney or Dr. Fester, Dr. Carter?  Which doctor was that?  I have a feeling that they saw the baby bird video, by the way.  I have a feeling we're indirectly involved with this.  Absolutely.  With him saying, you know, if you puke the water up, you're out.  Kind of like our eggnog drinking contest.  I don't want to do a hoo-hoo here.  Hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  I invented a vomiting.  But I have a feeling, because our baby bird video was just viewed by millions and millions 
[01:02:00]  of people.  That went viral all over the world.  I'm starting to think that we're indirectly involved with this.  I'm glad.  Just indirectly.  I'm glad that's never happened with one of our wonderful contests that we've had where  people have had to consume stuff.  That eggnog thing.  Because people have brought that up.  Yeah.  They drank a lot of eggnog.  Yeah.  But throwing it up, I guess, what, save them?  Or can you get the same thing from eggnog as you can from water? 
[01:02:30]  I don't know.  We don't do any research.  Stuff in eggnog?  I don't know.  I know.  Again, we don't do any research like that.  I don't know.  Jesus.  All right.  Listen.  We have to take a break.  That's the beginning, though.  All right.  You won't be hearing any more of that.  What?  No.  Let's go on to...  What?  I thought you were teasing.  Sorry.  I'm not teasing.  Like the good old days.  Look at the time.  Do we have to break or not?  We have to break.  Of course we do.  We have another one, two, three, four, five tracks to go. 
[01:03:00]  But there you go.  There's the taste.  Gets creepy.  That's the beginning of the contest.  They're waiting for the contestants to show up.  They basically brought to the table that, don't people die from this?  And you get to hear the actual dead woman speak.  Well, you know.  That's a little creepy.  That's a little creepy.  Yeah, it is really kind of creepy.  She sounds very fun, energetic.  Really?  Yeah.  Right up until her last appearance.  The last segment, she kind of sounds a little like... 
[01:03:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Maybe they...  Can we hurry up through this break?  We've got to get right back to this.  We'll get right back to this after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, what's up?  This is Bill Burr.  Just letting you know I'm going to be at the Improv in Washington, D.C., District of Columbia,  January 18th through the 21st.  You can call 202-296-7008 for tickets or go to improvclubs.com. 
[01:04:00]  Thank you.  Jack, relax.  Get busy.  The facts.  Those zodiacs are all the next.  All right.  Now we've got plenty of time.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Why don't you explain what's going on, PalTalk, this morning, Anthony?  Well, everyone's waking up.  Waking up with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:04:30]  It's wonderful.  This is a very interactive radio show to the new listeners.  Very interactive.  We've got PalTalk cameras in the studio.  We've got, what, two in here?  Yeah, we've got two in here.  What happened to the office cam?  Because people kind of enjoyed that as well.  Yeah, I don't know what happened to that.  And the PalTalk cameras are on and the audio's on, so you can kind of hear what we're doing  while you guys are listening to commercials on the radio.  Yeah, we carry on our discussions, have fun, watch other people's cameras, or one other 
[01:05:00]  person's camera, depending on what's happening at any given moment.  Baby girl this morning.  Yeah, baby girl this morning has been very entertaining.  Just decided I'm just going to be naked in bed giving little shows.  And then Jimmy asked to see her hiney.  He actually used the word hiney.  And, uh, she showed her hiney.  She certainly did.  And she's smoking away. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  She loves smoking cigarettes.  There's a lot of other things going on, but, uh, we've got to keep it friendly over  here.  All right, uh, Morning Rave Audio.  So where were we?  We, uh, we just played the first clip of this fine, uh, morning show that's no longer going  to be heard ever, ever, ever again.  The Morning Rave.  Yeah.  And, uh, they're gearing up for the big contest that wound up, um, uh, allegedly killing a  woman from water intoxication.  And they're discussing, uh, the dangers. 
[01:06:00]  And they're not quite sure of it.  One of the jocks seems to think he has the information that you would throw up before you  die of anything.  Like, wouldn't that mean you could take as much poison as, uh, you wanted?  You could drink like, uh, a Drano.  But as long as you throw up, you're okay.  You would not throw up from drinking water.  There's nothing in water to make you want to throw up.  People would throw up just from, some people do, uh, just, your stomach can't take that 
[01:06:30]  much being in it.  So, uh, you throw it up.  But once you start absorbing it, it's over, Johnny.  Okay.  Well, we're up to the next track.  Caller calls in to tell the show that the contestants can die.  Yeah.  There were a lot of signs.  Forewarning.  Even the hosts were, like, wondering if someone could die.  I heard you could die from this.  Die, die, die.  And then one of them just said, nah, I don't, I don't think that's possible.  Nah, you throw up first.  Let's move on.  Uh, so, yeah.  Caller calls up, goes, look, you could die from this. 
[01:07:00]  The hosts already know that.  More jokes about dying.  Here we go from the morning rave doing the hold your wee for a wee contest.  Eva.  Eva.  All right, enough with the music in the back.  They do that at AAF.  You got to talk over music.  Because what you have to say is not important.  That's what that says.  And, yes, we had to do that back in the day.  We weren't happy about it. 
[01:07:30]  And we, thank God, moved on.  Eva.  Eva.  Yes.  What do you want to say?  I want to say that, um, that those people that are drinking all that water can get sick  and possibly die from water intoxication.  Yeah, we're aware of that.  We're the sort of way to get it.  They sign releases, so we're not responsible.  It's okay.  And if they get to the point where they have to throw up, then they're going to throw up  and they're out of the contest before they die.  So that's good, right?  Oh, that's mean.  I suppose so.  Did you hear the hole?  Did you hear the hole? 
[01:08:00]  Oh, that's mean.  Oh, gosh, guys.  The hole is just doing what holes do.  Now.  Guys.  Oh, you killed her, guys.  Now, come on.  That's mean.  That is mean.  Mean.  That's good, right?  Oh, that's mean. 
[01:08:30]  I suppose so.  Yeah.  All right.  How come you guys didn't do it?  Thanks for looking out, though.  We don't want to die.  Oh, okay.  Let me ask Carter if anybody's dying.  We ain't dying.  Hey, Carter, is anybody dying in there?  We got a guy that's just about to die.  Oh, good.  Make sure you sign that.  I like that we laugh at that.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  Yeah, we got a guy that's about to die.  Oh, my God.  The signs were everywhere.  I guarantee you none of these people involved in this show can listen to this. 
[01:09:00]  They cannot.  I have not brought themselves to be able to listen to this yet.  No, of course not.  Because it's just the foreshadowing is creepy.  Although the criminal action now, they might have to go, what did I say that could get me in jail?  They might have listened to this out of necessity, like, did I say anything to get me thrown in jail?  Like, they're kind of showing knowledge of this.  Now, with my limited knowledge of the law, I would think this hurts them more than helps them because this takes away the pleading ignorance factor. 
[01:09:30]  Like, we had no idea that water could be dangerous to anybody.  We had no warnings or anything.  Obviously, they had some warnings, and instead of heating them, decided to loft them off.  So not only are they so fired, I'm starting to think they're so guilty.  So in jail.  Not just guilty, so guilty.  Oh.  Want to hear the next track?  Ow!  Oh, look at me.  My dumper hurts. 
[01:10:00]  I've been in prison for a day.  Bill from Waterford, I love it.  They signed releases, so we'll be okay.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, you'll be okay.  All right, here we go.  The host talked to the last two contestants, including Jennifer.  So now, what you're about to hear, the contest has been going on for a while.  They're getting close to two gallons of water.  Jennifer, you're going to hear her voice for the first time here.  She ended up dying after she left the studio.  A mere hours later, but this is beyond creepy, this next clip. 
[01:10:30]  Carter.  Yeah?  It's down to two people?  Yes.  Let's talk to the final two people.  Okay, hang on a sec.  Yes.  Come over here, lady.  We'll try to entice them with this.  Yes, I got something big.  We made it two women left.  Two chicks.  Hang on a sec.  All right.  There you go.  Hello?  Hi, who's this?  Jennifer.  Who?  Oh, my God, I can't listen to this.  Jennifer, you know, the dead girl.  She sounds kind of cute.  She sounds cute.  Yeah.  But she's not. 
[01:11:00]  She's back from the dead.  It's creepy.  Did you hear the whole two go, ha, ha, ha, two women left.  Two women left.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  See, the girls can do it.  You go, girl.  I mean, go, die.  Hi, who's this?  Jennifer.  Who?  Jennifer.  Jennifer?  Yeah.  Congratulations on making it to the final two.  Thank you.  How are you feeling?  I don't have to go pee, but my stomach is, like, really, really full. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is it all the way back up to your neck?  It looks like I'm pregnant again.  It's pretty funny.  I'm kind of entertained.  How much longer do you think you could go, Jennifer?  As long as my stomach will continue to let me, I don't know, maybe a couple more.  Yeah.  She had about 10 hours left in her life at this point.  Amazing.  She had 10 hours left to live.  We're listening to someone that ends up dying.  That's creepy.  Yeah.  Let's talk to a lawyer.  We got Jonathan.  Jonathan, what's up? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, man, Anthony.  How are you doing, guys?  All right.  What do you got on this case?  I practice both in California and Jersey, and this is a definite criminal negligence case.  If it's not an involuntary manslaughter, they can get them on criminal negligence almost 100%.  Because they show the necessity that the context is more important than human life.  And since they have prior knowledge of it being a case that even if somebody had died of water intoxication,  they signed a waiver, the waiver still wouldn't protect them because they know the consequences,  especially in California, the precedent of death when it comes to in the state. 
[01:12:30]  If somebody dies, regardless of a waiver or not, they're still held liable based on criminal negligence.  Then what's the use of a waiver?  Hello?  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear you.  What's the use of a waiver, then?  Unfortunately, I'm not really sure what the hell was going on with them.  But if their lawyers should have researched a little bit better, they'd realize that in California law,  any kind of homicide or even manslaughter, there's nothing that can really even prevent it or stop anybody from being prosecuted as such.  Yeah, there's no waiver for that.  If they can sign 20,000 waivers and have a pad full of lawyers, it still wouldn't stop them because the prosecution can get them on that negligence charge, 
[01:13:00]  which in turn can land them at least 10 to 15 years in jail minimum.  I think waivers are if something happens that the person giving you the waiver really doesn't have anything to do with  or any negligence is involved, then you're protected.  But the second you kind of boost it up by being negligent and stuff, then people can file suit against you. 
[01:13:30]  Thank you.  That's my legal knowledge.  I watch court TV occasionally.  Trying to help out.  All right, well, we get to hear more of Jennifer here in this next clip.  The dead girl.  The dead girl, yeah.  They're trying to get her to drop out of the contest.  This now might save them.  No, I don't think it has anything to do with them trying to get her to drop out to save her life.  I think they're trying to get her to drop out because the bit's running long. 
[01:14:00]  They just want to end this.  And they have to get back to music.  They want a winner.  That's it.  Who is this, Jennifer?  This is Jennifer.  Jennifer, what's the situation about Justin Timberlake tonight?  I don't want to.  I want the we.  You do want the we.  I was tempted.  I was really, really tempted.  And everyone's going to hate me forever.  I got a parent to you.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah, they are.  Yeah, they'll hate you.  She sounds nice, too.  She really does.  What a shame.  It's all silly and fun.  Just having a good time. 
[01:14:30]  Having some water.  Tea.  She wants to be the talk of the office.  You know, just remember when you did that contest.  Well, wow.  I'm tempted and everyone's going to hate me forever.  I got a pair of tickets.  Lower level.  Justin Timberlake, 2007 Future Sex Love Show Live, Arco Arena tonight.  And I will throw them away if you do not want to take them.  Or Lucy.  You can't throw them away.  Take the tickets and live.  We're not.  Trust me.  We're not going to throw them away.  Don't and die.  Take the tickets.  Take the tickets. 
[01:15:00]  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  Take them.  No deal.  No deal.  If she just would have taken the ticket, she probably would have lived because she sounded  okay at that point.  Where's our time machine?  And apparently after that, her not taking the tickets, they increased the size of the  water bottles.  Really?  And now made them drink even more water.  Yeah.  So if she would have taken the tickets, perhaps things would be a little different for them 
[01:15:30]  right now.  Say no to the tickets and you open the other curtain and it's a satin pillow.  Satin pillow.  Grim Reaper standing there showing it like a game show.  Like the girls at the game show, how they show off the prizes.  Yeah.  It's a satin pillow.  Oh, I'm going to have to say, God, this chili sucks.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal.  No deal. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  No deal.  Wow.  It was that close.  It was that close.  She was really thinking about it.  She was thinking about it.  That could have been the difference right there because she ended up drinking more water.  She could have went right to the bathroom and got a lot of that water out of her.  It would have been done deal.  Just like that.  She had a decision to make.  Wouldn't have heard about it.  And she wasn't sure.  She was like, it was like kind of a toss up for a while.  In that moment, she will now, her kids will not have her at their graduation. 
[01:16:30]  She'll never see grandchildren.  Yeah.  In that moment.  Just a split second.  That was the fork in the road of life right there.  One of the big ones.  That was a big interchange.  And just, you took the wrong one.  Yeah.  She went to a show and had fun.  That would be it.  Tony makes a great point in Cleveland.  Tony.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, Tony.  Hey, I guess me and Jennifer both have something in common.  We'd rather die than see Justin Timberlake.  Right. 
[01:17:00]  Doesn't say much for Justin Timberlake.  Let's go to Steve at Boston.  Is he another lawyer?  Steve, what's up?  You guys were asking about how the waiver helps or does not help.  Yeah.  The waiver is only going to help you if, for a civil case.  In other words, you can go ahead and have somebody sign a waiver saying, hey, I won't  sue you or my family won't sue you if something happens.  But there's absolutely no way you can waive your way out of a criminal prosecution.  Okay.  That's how it makes sense.  So what do you think is going to happen to the morning show? 
[01:17:30]  It's going to be tough.  It's going to be a rough time for these guys.  Really?  Yes.  They're in trouble.  I would not recommend doing this if I was you guys.  No, no.  We actually did this contest back in the day.  It's kind of hacked anyway.  Hey, listen.  Do you guys still listen to the little people stories, sightings, or whatever?  Is that going to go with?  Major stories.  Oh, jeez.  Wow.  All right.  Hold on.  We don't like to do it in this fashion, but hold on.  Got to find something here.  So anyway, Anthony, we're going to play the next track from the morning rave copy. 
[01:18:00]  We interrupt this program.  What?  Huh?  What?  Ozone midget sighting of the day.  Who saw this coming?  Certainly not me.  Steve in Boston, what's up?  You want me to start from the beginning, or do you want to hear my little people story?  Beginning of what?  Beginning of what?  I don't understand what you're even talking about.  We have no idea what you're talking about.  We're talking about this morning rave thing, and we interrupted the program because it looks  like you have a midget sighting.  Well, I had a fantastic midget sighting. 
[01:18:30]  I'm going to picture this.  I'm in Atlantic City.  I'm at the craps table.  I'm going on a pretty good roll.  All of a sudden, my turn is over, and what do I see but just this little white pair of  knuckles on the other side of the craps table launching these dice up in the air?  Now I'm thinking, what is going on over there?  There is a little person, if you will, launching the dice at this craps table.  You can imagine, if you will, nothing but little knuckles coming up from the bottom of  the craps table in the air, and I see dice flying out of them, and this little person 
[01:19:00]  went on one hell of a roll.  Won me a lot of money, but these knuckles come out of nowhere.  Pretty funny.  Little puffy knuckles, just with those big dice.  They look huge in his hand.  It looked like someone was throwing a baseball with a bunch of slugs hanging off of it.  Looks like someone's rolling the dice that hangs from your mirror.  Come on, seven.  Come on, seven.  It was great.  There was a little person friend with him, and losing money, so he's sitting here trying 
[01:19:30]  to get the little person to stop throwing.  The little person wants to keep throwing, and all you see every once in a while is a little  fat hand every once in a while jumping up.  Oh, wow.  That's a good one.  That's a good one, sir.  Looks good.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, bud.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Let's say hi to Josh in D.C.  Hey, Josh, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  You know, this woman's an idiot.  She could have just taken a ticket, scalped them, and probably bought two or three weeks  for herself. 
[01:20:00]  She wanted bragging rights, though, man.  Yeah.  We get into these situations with our show.  You know, the listeners, they want bragging rights.  They want to be the one that says, hey, I won the eggnog drinking contest.  I won the whatever contest, you know?  Yeah, but anything's better than dying.  Come on.  True, but she didn't know she was going to die.  She was just living in the moment.  Like, no, I want to have bragging rights.  They're going to be talking about me on the show for a while.  I'd be thinking about the cash the whole time.  I could care less about the system because you could just go buy it.  I mean, what difference does it make? 
[01:20:30]  Right.  Yeah, she's screwed up, obviously.  All right, guys.  The whole collection of them screwed up.  Yeah, let's say hi to Max in Dallas.  Max.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Max.  Hey, Anthony.  See, chicks named Jennifer just seem to cause all kinds of problems, don't they?  Yeah, I've noticed a trend, perhaps.  All right.  Well, let's say hi to Greg on Long Island.  Greg, what's up?  I've got to try it again.  Okay.  Do you think Jennifer is the talk of the water cooler? 
[01:21:00]  Well, you know, when you do a radio show, you're looking for water cooler talk.  Yeah.  So Greg might be onto something there.  Here's a law student before we get back to the remaining audio.  Yeah, I know.  Ron in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  I'm a long-time fan, first-time caller.  All right.  Quack, quack.  I'm a Harvard law student.  And technically, if the thing that they sign encompasses death in there, there's not a whole 
[01:21:30]  lot that they can pursue against the TV person, I mean, the radio personalities, but they can  really go after the person who's signed off on the contest because everything has to be  signed off by somebody.  Uh, uh, what?  I think you just talked over our heads.  Uh, yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to the audio.  Here we go.  Uh, Jennifer complains about being in pain.  The host says that's what it feels like when one is drowning. 
[01:22:00]  She said drowning.  Oh, drowning, they said?  Yeah.  Now you've got to give him a break.  Well, he's very not.  I can understand.  You've got to give him a break.  Uh, Jennifer drops out of the contest.  So it's just so...  And life.  Yeah.  She does not win the contest in the end.  Jennifer, I heard that it's not, you're not doing too well.  My head hurts.  Oh my God.  Her voice is...  Dude, I just got chills.  She's, uh, she's dying right now.  She just went from cute girl, you know, cute sounding girl to that is, that's the real 
[01:22:30]  deal happening right now.  See, she is dying right now.  Her brain is swelling, uh, to the point where she will die.  And this is what is happening to her right now.  You are listening to a woman who is dying.  Now, if she went right to the hospital...  It's snuff audio.  If she went right to the hospital, she would have been fine coming.  Maybe.  Yeah.  They could do something for you, right?  Apparently, we heard yesterday, they give you some kind of IV or some crap that the water  diluted out of you.  Uh, but, uh, I don't know. 
[01:23:00]  They go, here, eat this.  It's a sponge.  Quick.  Quick.  The timpani sound effect as she's dying.  Dying.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I know.  It's always good to have the nice, wacky, friggin' radio sound effects when a dying woman  is talking.  Jennifer, I heard that it's not, you're not doing too well.  My head hurts.  They keep telling me that it's the water that it's my, it'll tell my head to hurt and then  it'll make me puke, but...  Who told you that?  The intern? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She's getting advice from an intern.  An intern.  Oh, my God.  Who told you that?  That, uh, uh, it's the intern, uh, uh, the intern told ya?  The intern was smarter than anyone else on the show, though.  Knew a little bit about this water intoxication.  Puke, but...  Who told you that?  The intern?  Yeah.  That's one of those over there?  It kind of, it makes you, it hurts, but it makes you feel lightheaded, so I'm not sure  if I'm just, like...  This is what it feels like when you're drowning.  There's a lot of water inside of you.  Oh, it hurts. 
[01:24:00]  This is like deep blue sea.  So, we want to get you out of your misery.  We would like to offer you again, one more time.  And the last time.  The last time we're going to offer you this.  Justin Timberlake tickets for tonight.  Lower level.  Because it seems like Lucy has a big bladder and she's not going anywhere.  You know, they laughed at me for turning them down the first time, so I'm not going to  turn them down again.  I'll take them.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right, bring them in!  Hey, bring everybody in! 
[01:24:30]  Come on, bring them in, everybody!  Bring them in!  How creepy was that concert?  Two empty seats?  Lower level?  Just, just creepy empty seats.  Oh, wonder where those people are.  Why didn't they show up?  Huh?  Oh, well, anyway, I like this song.  She just got caught in traffic.  Yeah.  Wow.  And now, finally, the host comment on how sick Jennifer looks.  She can't stand up.  Yeah, she can't stand up. 
[01:25:00]  Uh-oh!  She looks sick.  Jennifer, you look pregnant.  Oh, my gosh, look at her belly!  Are you pregnant?  No, she said it looks like her belly, like, when she was pregnant.  Look, it's totally sticking out.  Oh, my gosh.  Look at that belly.  That is so funny.  That's full of water.  You're ready to...  You look probably three months pregnant.  Come on over.  She's a mother of three.  I know.  She's a little tiny thing, too.  That's so funny.  Come on over, Jennifer.  You okay?  You want to lay down?  What do you...  She can't even walk.  You're going to pass out right now?  Too much water?  I could probably drink more if you guys could pick me up when I... 
[01:25:30]  Do you want me to?  No.  What can I get for another?  What can I get?  Well, you're going to Justin Timberlake tonight.  You got tickets for that.  Thank you.  I don't think Lucy was going to give up, so...  Oh.  And no problem with Lucy, I guess, huh?  No.  The eventual winner of the contest.  No, I guess she went in and did her business.  Got rid of it.  Wow.  I don't know if Jennifer did.  Wow.  That is...  I've got to be honest.  That's really, really creepy. 
[01:26:00]  And I don't know what, you know, implications for the show this audio holds, but that's something.  You think it'll come up in court?  You think that'll be played a thousand times in a courtroom?  Of course it will.  Of course it will.  You can see that they obviously have knowledge of this water intoxication.  Did nothing.  They're laughing as a woman is dying.  Looks like a family's going to own a few radio stations.  Yep.  This is going to get ugly.  They won't go to jail, though. 
[01:26:30]  Huh?  They won't go to jail, because you could hear there was no intent there.  I mean, I know it's negligent, but they're all having fun.  She's saying she sounds fine in the first two clips.  Like, there's no way anyone's going to jail.  Yeah, I think it's a civil suit.  Big civil suit.  I think what kind of saves them is asking her if she wants to drop out, and she said no.  Yeah, I think that helps a little bit.  I'm no lawyer, but I think that helps a little bit.  Like, look, we offered.  We offered.  We said, look, you can leave right now.  Only you know your body.  Only you know what you can take. 
[01:27:00]  Here's some concert tickets.  What do you say?  And at that point, she said no.  That's true, Frank, but I don't think this case is that cut and dry.  There's not much else to say.  That's, uh, there you go.  This story has legs, and, uh, we've made the story.  Because now they're talking about famous radio stunts.  I've used to have legs.  I couldn't get the mic fast enough to go, no, you mean fins. 
[01:27:30]  Uh, whatever.  We made the Mercury News.  Famous radio stunts.  We're under the death and churches category.  Shock jocks Opie and Anthony were fired in 1998 from Boston.  We were.  For an April Fool's prank, uh, in which they alleged that Mayor Thomas Menino had died in a car crash.  In August 2002, they were fired from New York's NEW for a stunt involving a couple allegedly having sex in the vestibule of St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Why I never.  The duo is back on the air, both on XM Satellite Radio and CBS Radio. 
[01:28:00]  Hold on.  All right, well, uh, I guess we'll, well, a lot of calls coming in, though.  Let's say hi to Tom in Jersey.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Yikes.  Just want to congratulate you on broadcasting your first snuff film.  Well, how did it feel?  How did it feel listening to her voice?  Not good.  Whew.  Yeah, that's, that's, uh, creepy.  I mean, she.  That's eerie.  There, fellas.  I don't know exactly, but she died less than ten hours later, right? 
[01:28:30]  I think five hours later.  Five hours later.  Yeah, I went home.  Did she die in her sleep?  Laid down, and, uh, I don't think you have a choice.  I think, like, you just kind of nodded out.  Her brain got all swollen, and she just nodded out.  That was it.  A lot of people saying she was an adult.  She knew what she was doing.  Uh, and here's a doctor.  We'll end with this.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Uh, listen, uh, you guys were talking about, uh, basically how they could have prevented  this real easy.  If she had gotten to a doctor, gotten to a hospital right after that show, she would have been 
[01:29:00]  fine.  They put an IV with salt, concentrated more than that's in your blood, pulls the water out  of your brain, you're good to go.  Simple as that?  It's simple as that.  Anyway, um, one more thing.  Yeah, why wouldn't she go to the hospital?  Why doesn't he say saline?  Yeah, I could have just said saline, yes.  I forgot Professor Anthony was on the line.  Well, he was trying to dumb it down for him.  No, it just makes me think he's not a doctor, and he would, uh, just say that to get on the 
[01:29:30]  air.  Are you a doctor, Mike?  Be honest.  I'm actually in training to become a urologist.  Ew.  Yeah, it was right.  What can I say?  You see, Jimmy, some people go in this direction.  They're fixated on certain things.  I always found that you just gargle and make a diagnosis.  All right, Mike, thank you.  You've seen what I've seen.  Hey, one more thing, you guys.  Yeah.  Um, I'm going to have to invoke the R. Kelly defense here.  She, you know, maybe should have researched this on her own before she went into a contest 
[01:30:00]  drinking tons of water.  Similar to what I mean by R. Kelly is, you know.  Well, the scary part is when you, uh, participate in some of these contests, you think the radio  hosts are experts, and you just assume they did all the research.  Yeah, don't assume that ever.  Kind of with our Sex for Sam thing, if you look at it now, how ridiculous was that?  Who in their right mind would agree to that contest?  Yeah.  You know, but you're, you're just, uh, Joe Listener going, ah, they must have done all  their research.  Oh, sure.  We'll, we'll have sex all over the city, and I'm sure it won't be a problem. 
[01:30:30]  They obviously talk to the authorities.  Yeah, yeah.  It can't be illegal.  They talk to the lawyers.  They ran it past the lawyers.  Oops.  I guess we, uh, should announce that, uh, you know, we're just, we're just dummies.  Yeah.  We're just dummies trying to get ratings up.  That's all.  And by us, we mean all radio people.  Yeah, we're not experts in anything.  It's time to admit that.  We have a mic.  Just because it's coming out of some electronic device that's in front of you doesn't mean  we know what we're talking about. 
[01:31:00]  Right.  We're stupid.  Hey, E-Rock, any, uh, communique from, from one of the members of the morning rave that  they're thinking about coming on our show?  Nothing yet.  Nothing yet.  That means they are, uh...  I'd like to hear from, uh, them.  They're lawyering, they're lawyering up.  How about Fester, at least?  Can we get Fester or Carter?  What about Fester?  Yeah, all right, well...  Get Carter.  Uh, they're lawyering up and, uh, they're not gonna be talking anytime soon.  What if they do?  I think we have a shot at them.  Yeah.  All right, uh...  My baby is black? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, it could be the day.  American Idol?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Same old crap from the night before.  Yeah, it's kind of cool, though.  They had some really, really bad people.  All right, we'll figure out what we're gonna do next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:32:00]  Opie and Anthony!  Ah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning, Buffalo!  Oh, Buffalo.  How many people are, like, just...  What?  Looking at their radios.  Yes.  Good morning, Buffalo.  Hi, Buffalo.  They know how to support a radio show.  They certainly do.  They know what's going on.  They're telling friends.  They're spreading the virus in Buffalo.  Kickin' ass in Buffalo. 
[01:32:30]  Totally.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, because, you know, they moved some shows around up there in Buffalo.  We moved into Shred and Reagan's slot, and we're like, oh boy, they can revolt easily.  Easily, because, you know, Shred and Reagan were in the seats for like 10 years.  Yep.  They moved to afternoons, and we're doing very well in mornings in Buffalo, and guess what?  Shred and Reagan kickin' ass in afternoons.  Lucky basket gets to sleep in.  Good morning, Buffalo!  Yeah, no kidding.  We would trade you. 
[01:33:00]  We would trade you.  That'd be nice.  We'll take the afternoon slot again.  No worries there.  Imagine what it would be like to be, like, doing morning radio for years, and then you  do afternoons where it's like, oh my God, this is what a life is like.  This is what it's like to have a real life.  Yeah.  I look better like this, man.  When the week we were off, my girlfriend, this is the way I live.  Like, normally, I would go to bed at 6 and get up at 4 in the afternoon.  She's like, this is the way you used to do it.  I'm like, I'm the worst.  Yeah, yeah.  I like getting up in the morning, because I live like a human being. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I don't mind it at all.  Let's say hi to Kristen in Connecticut.  Kristen.  Good afternoon, Guy.  Yes.  Hi.  Guys, thanks for the buzzkill this morning.  Seriously.  But you couldn't turn off the radio, right?  I know.  It was like watching a train wreck.  I felt really guilty.  Like, I was vicariously listening and just really bummed out about it.  And now I'm on my way to my clients.  I drive an hour and a half.  You need to play something.  Do something happy.  Please, I'm begging you.  All right.  We'll do something happy.  Thank you.  I mean, how did it feel listening to that, though? 
[01:34:00]  It was incredibly creepy.  Very, very creepy.  Like, just hearing her voice, she seemed so sweet.  But what I was thinking is, her poor kids are probably, like, feeling guilty,  because she's probably trying to win it for them.  Did they get a wee?  Yeah.  And the kid's probably like, Mom, I want a wee.  And she's like, I don't have the money for it.  So she tries to win it for them.  And the kids probably have to live with feeling like they, you know,  had something to do with it.  Well, that's what they get for being such bad boys and girls.  Boy, a little brat.  Don't worry.  They're going to get plenty of gifts in the coming weeks. 
[01:34:30]  That's true.  No, honestly, there's no real jokes there.  I was listening to that.  And for the first time in a while, I was getting, like, just the douche chills.  Like, ugh, this is a little rough.  I almost started crying, honestly.  I'm not that much of a wuss.  Oh, don't cry.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do something happy, Kristen.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks for not turning it off.  And Anthony and I were talking during the break.  Could you see if she just wrapped around a telephone pole and is dead now?  That last caller?  I'm just saying how eerie that would be.  But we would never know because we don't know who she is. 
[01:35:00]  How many times has that happened?  Hopefully a lot.  Just trying to diffuse the death audio we heard from the woman.  We just heard death audio.  You never know.  That's what I'm saying.  Death audio.  A death dedication.  I'm Casey Casey.  I'm sort of going there, yeah.  Well, we were talking during the break.  Good Morning American now just played the audio that we just played.  Yep.  Or, well, you know, it's TV, so they can't go long form at all.  So they played, like, ten seconds of it. 
[01:35:30]  A couple of snippets.  A couple of quick clips of it.  And I'm thinking to myself, how did this audio get out?  And stupid me, I'm thinking back in the old days.  Anthony and I, I can't tell you how many times we were doing some crazy thing on the radio.  And a general manager would come running in all sweaty, sweaty in his suit.  His hair is all just out of place because he's been rubbing his hair like, oh, my God, what to do?  And general managers would run in and go, if anyone calls and says that they need a tape of this show, just tell them we don't tape your show. 
[01:36:00]  And then would run back out.  No tapes, no tapes.  There's no tapes, right?  I mean, well, everything was taped.  Yeah, our policy is we don't tape anything around here, okay?  Understood.  Just in a panic.  But you can't use that defense anymore.  Radio stations would use that defense with the FCC.  Look, you know, because the FCC would get a complaint or something like, really, they did what?  We need to hear this.  Yeah, we need tape of it.  To see if there were any violations.  And then, of course, the company would, you know, would get back to the FCC and go, we don't tape anything. 
[01:36:30]  We don't have any copies of that.  Occasionally we've taped stuff, but not that day.  No, we.  What day were you looking for?  No, no, not that day.  No.  And, you know, but now it's different.  Everybody's taping all the freaking time.  Everything is recorded.  Listeners.  So that defense doesn't work anymore.  I remember Bruce Mittman back up in Boston just running in in a panic on so many afternoons going, ah, ah, if there's a tape of what you just did, destroy it. 
[01:37:00]  Are we, you understand me, right?  The homosexuals are angry, boys, so destroy any tapes that you might have.  Wink, wink.  Love that guy.  All right.  How about American Idol?  Yeah.  Saw it.  I don't think we need to spend too much time on it today.  It's getting torturous.  It's pretty much the same as the first night.  It was from Seattle.  Dude, 37.3 million viewers.  Huge. 
[01:37:30]  First night of American Idol.  It was from Seattle, and it just reinforced that whole Seattle, too cool for their own good, think they are so hip, and meanwhile, they just sucked.  A bunch of artsy, fartsy people, you know, the tree hugger variety type that just want to, like, piss their parents off.  So they spike their hair and dye it a wacky color and pierce everything and think that's new. 
[01:38:00]  And then they come up on stage and proceed to make total asses of themselves, which is pretty much what they did.  I think they got a total of seven usable bulls in Seattle.  Yeah.  About 16,000.  Even when the bad singers weren't really good enough to really find like this.  It was full of bad singers and retarded people.  There seems to be a lot of retarded people in Seattle.  Like, really, there's something wrong with them mental, physically.  They're getting too much water. 
[01:38:30]  Is that what it is?  It's a rainy city.  It is really.  I'm making a rain joke.  The first day was rain.  The first day they had the auditions, it was raining.  And then the second day was nice and sunny.  Too much water on the brain.  Water on the brain.  They're saturated.  They stunk.  They can't think quite right.  And they had the cute little retards that they like to exploit sometimes.  There's, you know, where they team up two freak show people and make them look like they're the best of friends for their time that they're auditioning together. 
[01:39:00]  They did it last year with a couple of retards.  They did it this year, too.  And everybody, Simon is like really nasty to a lot of the people that come in.  But these two retards came in like not at the same time, one after the other.  And they were being very, very nice to them because they even knew, oh, my God, we will be killed if we goof on the retarded.  And they are so obviously retarded.  Really?  Like for real retarded? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Like definitely something.  That fat kid was retarded.  There's some inbreding in his past.  Inbreding.  We put a little inbreding on the turkey and paste it and it'll be wallah.  It's wonderful.  Yeah, there was some kind of inbreding going on.  That's my new thing.  Inbred crumbs.  And by the way, did I call it with the security guards?  It kind of takes away from how tough Simon really is.  Oh, and that hairdresser guy. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, we were talking about this yesterday.  We're like, of course they're all real brave.  They got muscle right to the right, right off camera.  Yeah.  That's what I was saying yesterday.  And sure enough, one of the contestants tried to moose up Simon's hair or something.  Yeah, they.  Or whatever in his hair.  They were goofing on him.  And you saw these two big, huge security guys come running into the frame.  To escort him out of the...  I think that takes away from Simon's meanness.  Really?  Yeah.  I thought he was kind of all alone there.  You got to know, he's kind of an asset, kind of a commodity for the program. 
[01:40:30]  They don't want some guy coming over there and punching him square in the face, putting  him in a coma.  And the other door gag is just great.  Yeah.  I noticed it the first night I was watching it.  I'm like, this is a gag.  It's a bit.  They have double doors to go in and out of the place.  There's no reason to have one door locked.  Right.  It's double doors going in and out of the audition room.  They lock one of them and leave one open.  So that when somebody's all dejected, they hit the wrong door and Simon just goes, other 
[01:41:00]  door.  Other door.  All disgusted.  You hear...  Sometimes they don't even show the person leaving.  You just hear that...  And Simon's face going...  Other door.  It's a great bit.  And they probably tell them before they go in, you come in through the right door, you  leave through the left door.  Yeah, leave through the left.  Other door.  But you tell me...  Shut up.  So you want to hear Kenneth and Jonathan or you want to hear the psycho guy, Nicholas,  the software guy?  Any of these that we have clips of would be fine. 
[01:41:30]  The psycho guy was, again, another guy that's just crazy.  They say you can really tell if someone's crazy if you can see the whites of their eyes  underneath and above the color part of your eye.  And you absolutely could on this guy.  The girl I used to date told me that.  There's a term for it because every one of our listeners had it at F.H. Reilly's.  F.H. Reilly's?  Did you say F.H. Reilly's? 
[01:42:00]  I did.  It was, I believe, in Huntington Avenue in Huntington, New York.  400.  400, of course.  I meant to say that.  Part of Huntington on Long Island.  Yeah.  Our restaurant.  Yes, sir.  It's a fine restaurant owned by the O.P. Hughes and his brother.  And we went out there and had some good cheesecake.  But the listeners showed up and they all had that three-quarters white thing showing.  Yeah.  There's a term for that.  And she told me the term and I forgot what it was.  Crazy.  Yeah.  Nuts.  It's called crazy.  And this guy had it.  His eyes are just wide open. 
[01:42:30]  And he sang one of Simon's favorite songs.  Unchained Melody.  Unchained Melody.  I guess this would be the hit of the show last night.  It was all right.  It wasn't as good as the first night.  I don't think we need to play Kenneth and Jonathan.  It goes on forever.  What, the two retarded guys?  Yeah.  If we could get a little of the fat kid singing.  That's all I want.  Which one would he?  I think.  Was he the one that looked like a monkey?  Because Simon, one of these guys was deformed. 
[01:43:00]  He had some kind of deformity where he was half midget.  That's the fat guy.  All right.  We got the fat guy singing.  God bless America.  He had a lift, too.  Land that I love.  There you go.  Take it down.  Stand beside her and guide her.  It's like if Cartman was a human being.  A real human.  Oh, my God.  It is.  He is the living Cartman. 
[01:43:30]  Listen, he's the living Cartman.  You can kind of hear it in his voice.  You guys.  Yeah, I'm really the prefer.  He's the living Cartman.  God bless America.  You guys.  Land that I love.  Stand beside her.  Hey.  And guide her.  Sounds real good.  Unless you're a stupid Jew. 
[01:44:00]  He's been practicing a lot upstairs in the holding room, so he sounds like he's ready.  That's his simian friend.  Yeah, listen through the door.  To the oceans, white with foam.  God bless America.  God bless America.  My home sweet home.  Oh, nice. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, Simon just says beautiful.  What did the judges say to him?  Wow.  It was, they were being nice to him.  They really, like, were overly nice to this kid because he was obviously, he had some type  of mental problems.  Do we have more of his singing?  Because I think he sang another song.  Yeah, well, they weren't sure if he was going to go to Hollywood or not.  So they said, hey, you've got to sing another one. 
[01:45:00]  So I believe it was Sticks.  Yeah.  Come sail away.  Wow, they seem to like the music that isn't there for the auditions.  Well, I figured they'd help them along a little more than the other contestants.  I'm sailing away.  This ain't bad.  Set an open card for the virgin, see, see, see, see, cause I've got to be free. 
[01:45:30]  Free to face the life that's ahead of me.  Fantastic.  I'm burned and you're kicking, so let me breathe.  We search for to marry on every ship I would say, oh, Lord, I'll trade. 
[01:46:00]  Here it comes.  Take care of you.  That must have hurt so bad to sing like that.  No kidding.  There you go.  A little pace.  It goes on for six minutes.  Trust me, I would love to listen to the whole thing right now.  Hey, Carrie from New York.  Actually, Jersey knows the term for the white eyes thing.  Carrie, what's up?  Hi.  Hey, Carrie.  I'm not sure that this is the same thing we're talking about, but there's a book about it. 
[01:46:30]  That's called San Picou.  San Picou.  I don't know what language that comes from.  Maybe French.  San what?  San Picou.  Yeah, I think it is right.  What?  San Picou or something.  I forget what it is.  Yeah, when you can see the white around the color part.  Like, they said that about the runaway bride.  Remember the runaway bride?  Right.  You could see the white surrounding the color part of her eyes.  But, yeah, that's just ringing a bell.  Look, it's like from...  Getting your medical knowledge.  Why does that mean you're nuts?  Runaway bride. 
[01:47:00]  It just means you don't have, you know, proper eyelids.  Maybe because your psychos always open their eyes a certain amount, or maybe that's just  nature's way of letting the rest of us know you're an ass.  Yeah, but you would get tired trying to keep your eyes open that long.  But, dude, you could always tell a googly-eyed kook, like, someone whose eyes are always  bugged out wide, is normally a problem.  There's never a subtle, gentle person with their eyes bugged out wide.  No.  No.  No.  All right, let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Mike.  What's going on, gentlemen?  Do you have the clip of Simon telling the kid with Agent Orange that he looked like a 
[01:47:30]  monkey or a lemur or something like that?  Yeah, he said he looked like a bush baby.  But he was trying to...  Yeah, I think he did look like a lemur or something.  All right, do you want to hear that?  He had some kind of physical deformity.  All right, yeah, so that other guy, his friend with the googly eyes performed, and then I  guess this is what Simon had to say.  I hope this is the right track.  Well, Simon said that my dancing was horrendous, my singing was terrible, and I was...  And he compared me to a monkey. 
[01:48:00]  Okay, so you've gone.  You didn't make it.  All right, so that's after he left.  Yeah.  I got to find it.  Hold on a minute.  He was really bad, but again, they were nice to him because he was deformed.  Kenneth, you and I need to have a conversation, I think.  I love it.  First of all, you are aware this is a singing competition.  Yeah.  Right.  So why do you think you could win?  Because I have a good voice, and I believe that I am the next American Idol.  In fact, I know I am.  Right.  Well, you look a little odd. 
[01:48:30]  Your dancing is terrible.  The singing was horrendous.  And you look like one of those creatures that live in the jungle with those massive eyes.  What are they called?  Bush baby.  Simon, you are sick.  Simon, you're crazy.  He's sick.  No, Randy.  He's crazy.  He's crazy.  No, but I'm just being sick.  Randy, it's okay.  He's sick.  Simon, you're going to say what you're going to say.  But you know what?  Yep.  That's your opinion.  You're entitled to it.  But it's a pretty good opinion.  Yeah.  It really is a pretty good opinion in the end.  And his opinion.  Whether you like him or hate him, it's a pretty good opinion. 
[01:49:00]  And his opinion is pretty much what makes or breaks you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Kirk in Jersey.  Kirk.  Yeah.  Hey, this kid was a spitting image of Gollum from Lord of the Rings.  That's it.  That's it.  Looked like Gollum.  There you go.  That's what your defense is, though, when you have no answer to somebody.  Get that.  That's your opinion.  Your opinion.  And let me tell you, buddy boy, pally.  All right.  This is what they said to the fat kid.  Are we going back to this?  All right. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, the fat kid.  Jimmy asked, what did they say after that?  God bless America thing.  Live action Cartman.  Look, Jonathan.  Look, you're a nice guy, right?  I like you.  But this is not the career path for you.  It's enough.  Okay.  Thank you, Jonathan.  Thanks for coming out, dude.  Always believe in yourself because...  And then they play the music and have them walk off together.  Two freaks of nature. 
[01:50:00]  East paced.  I think we have time to do Psycho Nicholas.  I think this was the highlight of the show.  This guy was very creepy.  Uncomfortable in his own skin.  Doesn't really know how to socialize.  He does software and has no business, obviously, trying out for American Idol.  A real creep.  What is it about yourself that makes you the next American Idol?  I am a leader.  You're a leader.  Yes.  I can project myself real well.  I can...  Army of none.  L-I-T-E. 
[01:50:30]  Choir situations that I've been in before, I've been kind of the leader voice of choirs that I've been in.  That's good.  And how old are you?  27.  27.  27.  What makes you unique, apart from being a good leader?  What makes me unique?  I don't really have a good answer for that.  But I just like to think I'm a lot different than a lot of other people.  Would you say your voice sets you apart from everyone else?  I would say so, yes. 
[01:51:00]  That's a...  Yeah.  You know, why don't you show us what you're talking about?  What are you going to sing?  Okay.  I am going to sing Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers.  That's Sonny's favorite song.  That's what I've been told.  I want to know when Nicolas Cage went out for America.  He sounds exactly like stupid Nicolas Cage.  Wow, I didn't notice that because I've seen him.  So I could just pick care of that lunatic.  But you hear a...  Oh, he's like pasty mouth and can't talk. 
[01:51:30]  Well, this is what he's saying.  Listen to this.  Oh, my love, oh, my darling, I hunger for your touch.  And all that lonely time. 
[01:52:00]  And time goes by so slowly.  Wait for the good part.  Oh, yeah.  And time can do so much.  There's a big payoff coming up.  Are you still mine?  I need your love. 
[01:52:30]  I need your love.  I need your love.  Godspeed, your love to me, to me.  Lonely rivers run to the sea, to the sea, to the open hearts of the sea. 
[01:53:00]  He's feeling comfy.  Wait for me.  I'll be coming home.  Wait for me.  Oh, my love.  Oh, my darling.  I hung up for your touch. 
[01:53:30]  A long and lonely tonight.  Thank you, Nicholas.  They let him go because they know he was just making an ass of them.  Stephen from Bayshore, that sounded more like unbrained melody.  She should have been on. 
[01:54:00]  She should have been a star.  She would have been the star of American Idol.  I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[01:54:30]  The part is here, you belong.  Hey.  And then someone else is saying, that guy, it sounds like he's about to go, ta-da.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  I play the lute, Simon.  The lute.  I'm a luteist.  Just call Andy.  It's time.  You stink.  Just call him.  Get it done.  Stop teasing it.  Get it done.  I love the signs. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, I know.  All right.  This is what they said to Psycho Nicholas.  They just, they just, they just were as honest as possible with this one.  What the bloody hell was that?  It was me.  It's honest.  Is that not good enough?  No.  Not even close.  Okay.  So, that would be a yes or a no, Simon. 
[01:55:30]  One of the worst I've ever heard.  So, that would be a no?  It was almost non-human.  It was really, really bad, dude.  Out of tune, bad tone, weird tone, actually.  Not pleasant.  None of the things you want singing to be.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  All right.  Good looking out, man.  So, when will you sing again?  I don't really know.  Maybe next year, or maybe, I don't know.  That's pretty much all I have to say about that. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  We'll go as far as the gunpoint.  Guess I gotta go.  Guess I gotta go.  Yeah, caster Troy.  All right.  People are asking for the first one.  Hotness.  Oh, the hotness.  Yeah, maybe we'll play it when we get back.  We really gotta step aside for a little bit.  I don't know.  The hotness was a slob.  A slob.  She should call herself the ugliness.  There was nothing hot about the hotness. 
[01:56:30]  Her mouth looked like a...  It looked like the opposite end of your mouth.  Like, you know when you eat, you put the food in your mouth?  Yeah.  Looks like the opposite end of that.  Especially...  That whole process.  Especially if you eat Taco Bell a lot.  Yeah.  That's what it looked like.  Like she had a lip transplant.  Old cinnamon lips.  Yeah.  Do you think she's hot, Jimmy?  There's a picture of her. 
[01:57:00]  That's the hotness.  No, not really.  She goes by the hotness, by the way.  And they asked her why she's called the hotness, and apparently it was because in high school  she was kind of wild and popular, and I was laying there in bed watching, and I go,  oh, okay, she was the whore in high school.  She was just the whore.  She looks like Fred Gwynn, but she's like...  I'm the hotness, Lily.  Lily.  I'm the hotness.  Looks like she worked out those lips a little too much.  Grandpa, I need a singing potion, Grandpa. 
[01:57:30]  Okay, Eamon.  She does look like Fred Gwynn.  If you're the hotness, you should not even resemble anything of Fred Gwynn.  You better make sure you're hot if you're going to call yourself the hotness.  The hotness?  There should never, ever be a question.  Not a hint of Fred Gwynn should be in you if you're the hotness.  Jessica Biel.  Do you look at Jessica Biel and think anything of Fred Gwynn?  No.  Of course not.  Jessica Biel could call herself the hotness.  The hotness. 
[01:58:00]  Not this broad.  Of course.  With puffy lips.  Not even good puffy lips.  Puffy cinnamon lips.  Sometimes you see a puffy lip.  You know, lips are nice.  Shut up.  Double chin.  Scarlett Johansson.  The hotness.  The hotness.  You could call her the hotness.  Oh, yeah.  Stalker Patty.  Exactly.  All right.  We'll give you a taste of the hotness.  What's going on, Jennifer? 
[01:58:30]  Not a lot.  Ready to get my sang on.  You know you can't.  Get my sang on.  By the way, listen very closely.  They did something a little different with the hotness here.  Yeah?  Yeah.  A little different.  They ended her audition a little differently.  What's going on, Jennifer?  Not a lot.  Ready to get my sang on.  You know you can't sing with gum in your mouth.  Oh, gum.  Can I throw this away somewhere?  Stick it on Taylor's face or something.  No.  Oh, Simon.  I got it.  No, it's cool.  I got it.  Today, I'm going to be singing Tenderoni. 
[01:59:00]  I want your love.  Okay.  Baby, I think of you.  I think of you a million times a day.  Baby, I cannot.  I cannot get you outside my head.  And, baby, I'm crazy and it's always about you.  All that I know is I belong to you.  Oh, baby, I want your love. 
[01:59:30]  Yes, she was tasered right there.  Newer addition to American Idol.  The first contestant to be tased on American Idol.  It happened last night with the hotness.  Are we weighing E-Rock next?  Yes.  Great.  Sam's alarms went up.  You're so happy about that.  I know.  Any time E-Rock is being goofed on, Sam is happy.  E-Rock, we're going to make a deal with you today. 
[02:00:00]  Do you feel adventurous?  Ooh.  Are you willing to be adventurous?  Yes or no?  Yes.  Wow.  That means you will do what we say next.  Yes or no?  You won't die.  Drink two gallons?  No, you won't die.  And you won't be naked.  Yes. 
[02:00:30]  That's it.  Or no?  Yes.  He said yes.  Wow.  Montage!  Montage!  We weigh E-Rock next.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And he said he would be adventurous.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's the Opie and Anthony virus.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Ooh, Jimmy's dancing. 
[02:01:00]  Hope you know that by now.  Swim walking.  Swim walking.  Jimmy's off to Chicago.  Yes, tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  Three different zanies in Chicago.  I'm doing Steve Dahl's show tomorrow, which I'm very psyched about.  Very cool.  So make sure you check out Jim on WCKG in the Chicago area tomorrow in the afternoon there.  I'm going to have a staff lunch.  A lunch with the staff, the sales staff.  Ooh.  It's going to be a barn burner.  They're really into the show in Chicago.  WCKG, yeah.  They're really into it.  Nothing really happening with the ratings yet in Chicago. 
[02:01:30]  But they're into the show.  They're believing in the show.  So we'll see what happens in the coming months.  But Jimmy's going up there to do his comedy and also kind of take a look and see what Chicago's all about for us.  And hopefully we'll be up there very, very soon.  Well, not very soon.  It's winter.  We're not stupid.  Yeah.  When it gets nice and warm, we'll visit your fine city and take a look around.  Because I'd like to look around.  Yeah.  I don't want to go to a city and have to stay in a hotel room because it's five degrees out.  Correct. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you.  It'd be funny if they pushed me in the conference room and then just raped me while making me read the numbers out loud.  This is what you're doing to us.  Strangely sexy.  Anyway, are we ready yet?  Kind of?  E-Rock.  E-Rock gained a lot of weight during the holiday. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, tons.  And packed it on.  What was it?  19 pounds, we figured?  You said 15, but then you openly admitted you weighed 200 pounds before Christmas.  And we weighed you at 219.  So you gained about 20 pounds.  How tall are you, E-Rock?  5'11".  Okay.  He's not a fat guy, but he just looks like he shouldn't be fat.  He's a big boy.  Some people should be fat.  Some people, you know, that's your thing.  You're fat.  You look good.  You look fine.  You look healthy even as a fat guy. 
[02:03:00]  E-Rock, on the other hand, doesn't look like he should be a fat guy or even a little bit chubby.  Because he's not muscular.  Like, he has the body consistency of a cyst.  Danny, are you ready?  It's what they call doughy.  And before the break, you did say that you're going to be adventurous for the show today, right?  Mm-hmm.  Not knowing what we had planned for you, right?  No.  Well, basically, E-Rock, we're not weighing you today.  Or maybe we will later.  I don't know.  Because it's obvious he's losing the weight. 
[02:03:30]  What we have decided instead.  Danny, if you will, come on in.  It's Danny, everyone.  Representing the staff of the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, no.  Where did Danny get that?  I think one of the interns brought it in, right?  One of the new guys?  His closet.  Oh, hold on.  There you go.  No, a faithful listener helped us out with this one.  He came by with this?  Yeah, he dropped it off.  Danny, because it is radio, what are you holding up?  This is a lovely pink bunny suit.  Is that from a shining prop auction? 
[02:04:00]  Hope it's been washed.  It's a pink, yes, bunny costume.  Complete with masks, mittens, and booties.  And booties.  He's got little ears on the little bunny hat.  It looks like a Christmas story.  Yeah.  When he gets his little bunny suit for Christmas morning and opens up his presents.  Little pink mittens.  It's pink mittens.  What is that for?  That's the booty.  Oh, the booty.  Yeah.  So, E-Rock, this is what's going to happen. 
[02:04:30]  You're going to put on the pink bunny suit, and you're going to do chubby bunny today.  We got marshmallows, too.  Marshmallows.  Hurry up.  We're running out of time.  And you will wear the pink bunny suit as we walk over to Texas.  And don't choke to death on the bunny suit.  Although it would be hysterically funny, it would be so ironic.  Yeah.  As E-Rock puts the pink bunny suit on and gets ready to do chubby bunny.  Of course, we're taping this.  The video will be up on opiananthony.com. 
[02:05:00]  All our videos are up on opiananthony.com.  Yeah, a lot of people say, hey, what are you doing?  This is visual.  We can't see the bunny suit on the radio.  Hey, Larry King, you have a computer, right?  We put all these videos up on various websites.  They always end up on YouTube.  Unlike Larry King.  Right.  The rest of America knows exactly how to use it.  We know.  The internet.  About technology.  My girlfriend said I should make phone calls with a Blackberry, but I got juice all over  my face. 
[02:05:30]  I'm a blithering old fool.  E-Rock, you gotta hurry.  We're running out of time here.  Why'd you sniff it and make a face, Eric?  It smells.  It smells like what?  What does it smell like?  It smells like an attic.  It's like golden musty smell.  It's not like it's getting a lot of use.  Grandma.  It's not many uses for a pink bunny suit.  Once a year it comes out, the Easter bunny thing.  And that isn't even like, no one does that anymore.  Anthony, as E-Rock puts on the pink bunny suit, we got your CSI, David Caruso, line of the 
[02:06:00]  day.  All right.  Or a few of them, actually.  I love it.  Here's today's batch.  What about witness statements?  So far, just a lot of confusion.  Jury only had one week before deliberations.  No need now.  The verdict is in.  No need now.  The verdict is in.  All right.  So where's the...  Skip that?  Why?  We've heard it?  Okay.  We'll go to this one.  I can't remember anything.  Okay. 
[02:06:30]  Listen, I don't want you to worry about it.  All right?  Mr. Coleman.  Because I...  I'll be your memory.  All right.  Another one.  Gang shootings usually go down on the streets in their own territories.  This time, I was in a public place.  So they brought the war to us.  Now we are going to take it to them.  It's like an SNL parody sketch. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is not really an actor acting on the number one rated show.  Now everyone is onto this.  Obviously, the video on YouTube, forget about it.  Yeah.  It's getting viewed like crazy.  But I'm surprised it took so long for everyone to realize what was going on with this guy.  He had a ride along.  Four or five babysitting service.  He asked me.  Severeign should be in a patrol car.  Frank, where is Patrick now?  Well, I don't know. 
[02:07:30]  He's missing from the scene.  Maybe he took off.  Or maybe he got taken for a ride.  All right.  Enough.  We could go on with the CSI David Caruso thing.  But E-Rock is in the pink bunny suit.  You look like an adult baby.  You look like an adult baby.  You look like a plushie, yeah.  Oh, is this creepy?  We actually got that from Michael Devlin's basement.  Michael Devlin bit.  Yeah, you really. 
[02:08:00]  Wow.  What a creep.  Oh, my God.  Look at it.  I didn't look at his whole.  Look at his face.  Yeah, it's kind of like a bunny mask.  You kind of really fit that.  You got the perfect face for the pink bunny suit.  It's slightly chubby.  Oh, you are a chubby bunny.  All right, listen.  We only got a couple minutes left on this side of the Opie and Anthony show before we walk over to XM.  So it's time for Chubby Bunny with E-Rock.  Please don't choke.  I need this gig.  It's what they do at county fairs and Girl Scout meetings. 
[02:08:30]  You put a marshmallow in your mouth and you say chubby bunny and then you put another marshmallow in your mouth and you say chubby bunny.  You do not swallow the marshmallows and you keep doing this until you can't anymore and then you spit them out.  What is the record?  What is the ONA record, by the way?  20.  By you, right?  Yeah.  All right.  He's got the current record. 
[02:09:00]  But it's – the Pal Talkers can see this?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A nice close-up of him.  They got a good close-up of his face and the bunny suit.  But he will be walking over to XM dressed like that, right?  Absolutely.  Okay.  I wasn't sure.  And Sam's got his camera.  I'm a camera.  And the videos will be up on opiananthony.com later today.  Here we go.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny. 
[02:09:30]  I hate to have to do the Heimlich on a bunny.  I know.  Don't laugh.  Cut the hole out of the back of the costume.  Chubby bunny.  No laughing.  No laughing.  Make it choke.  There's no laughing at chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  It's five, you goose egg.  Chubby bunny. 
[02:10:00]  Chubby bunny.  How many are we up to?  Seven.  Seven?  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  People want to cut off his feet for good luck.  Don't laugh.  Stop it.  No laughing.  Chubby bunny.  Chubby bunny.  I'm all nervous because some woman choked at a county fair doing this. 
[02:10:30]  And died.  That's how we figured it out.  And this is.  She died.  And that's when we decided we needed to do this on our show.  I guess you're right.  Vroom vroom.  Hey, we got quite an audience, so.  Who wouldn't want to see this?  Vroom vroom.  What if the snake is thrown out with Travis?  How many are we up to?  Anyone counting?  No.  Are they counting on pal talk?  Stop laughing.  I think they're.  10.  I think they're saying 10.  No, someone else just said 12. 
[02:11:00]  What?  There's more than 2.  I give them 10.  He'll give us the count.  He's keeping track.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  He's having problems.  Vroom vroom.  You know he could die from fatness. 
[02:11:30]  This is how he eats his lunch.  Uh-oh.  Problem?  Vroom vroom.  Vroom vroom.  Oh, God.  Careful.  Careful?  We like this gig?  God.  Wow, he looks like he's having a real problem.  Oh, boy.  Breathe through your nose. 
[02:12:00]  I don't want the slippery ones to slip back and.  Yeah.  Who else is really nervous right now?  Yeah, his epiglottis and just like.  Who else is really nervous right now?  I'm nervous slash turned on.  All right, spit it out, you ass.  Spit it out.  Oh, he's saying no.  He said no.  We got it on camera.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to look at it.  You know how well that works.  Get rid of it. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, God.  It came out in a big lump.  He got it out.  All right.  Yeah.  And that's how we end the show today.  E-Rock in a pink bunny suit.  How many?  Doing chubby bunny for the Opie and Anthony show.  The video will be up on opieandanthony.com.  How many, E-Rock?  I lost count.  Good boy.  You lost count?  Yeah.  You have to skip in that outfit.  Why don't you count them in the, uh, so I'm going to say an 18.  Just short of the record.  You know, if he would have died doing that, we wouldn't have been able to take the bunny 
[02:13:00]  suit off because you can't mess with any evidence.  So they'd, like, have to haul him out in that coroner's gurney in a bunny suit.  All right.  Hope you had fun today.  We had a great time.  Sam.  It's a dead rabbit, Sam.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have yourself a great day.  Thanks for listening.  Bye.  Go see Jimmy at Zaney's in Chicago for all you guys in the Chicago area.  And listen to him on WCKG tomorrow afternoon with Steve Dahl. 
[02:13:30]  Thanks, guys.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up?  This is Bill Burr.  Just letting you know, I'm going to be at the, uh, the Improv in Washington, D.C., District  of Columbia, January 18th through the 21st.  You can call 202-296-7008 for tickets or go to improvclubs.com. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you.  Jack, relax, get busy with the facts.  Those Zodiacs are all in action.  The maniacs are on the S display.  Opie and Anthony are taking a break from the XM walkover today because it's too fucking cold.  You can still join the crew of the Opie and Anthony show for the walk to XM, but we're just not going to broadcast it.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy this classic moment from the ONA archives.  What's the temperature today?  50 below my asshole.

[02:20:00]  people commented on my career right and being really pissed off about it well now it's our  turn it's our turn what they did was wrong i am outraged let me get my arrow i'm outraged i'm  outraged this show should never be allowed to do radio ever again this has put a black mark on radio  you know when marconi first invented the radio i told you oh boy i told you they would drag us in 
[02:20:30]  it's it's happening let me practice uh we have on uh phone right now uh shock jocks opie and anthony  you might remember they themselves got into trouble a few years ago uh by having a couple  engage in sexual activity at saint patrick's cathedral which led to their firing but they  are back on the air on xm satellite radio and various fm radio stations across the country  opie and anthony welcome hi thank you uh thanks for having us alice thanks for having us alice 
[02:21:00]  okay guys let's get right into this okay you talk it's um that'll start it was all on the right foot  um guys you're familiar with this story um what what how do you feel about this what happened  well alice it's a tragic day for radio uh yeah yeah i never thought it would get to the point  where listeners would actually die ah yes yes yes we were hoping to be the first show to kill a  listener absolutely and if you looked at our list look at all the press they're getting we really 
[02:21:30]  need a listener to die to get the talk up actually if you look at the new york ratings allison uh you  would assume we had killed all our listeners but uh no that hopefully there's a few still out there  no alison the reality is our dummies don't know how to take care of the opie and anthony show  shows all about allison allison allison you'll be a great answer great if they ask you what you  thought of it go well you know we've done research and jennifer was she was a cunt 
[02:22:00]  well uh we've lost the feed but with no rancor at all no anger just gentle just say it as a matter  of fact yeah i guess we have to tell people that uh why all the naked nakedness today what is all  how many do you have up is there nate is it naked thursday on pow talk today i got what i usually  pop up um i usually make sure our cams are all up first no today i was like popping up a couple of 
[02:22:30]  other cams first um someone's saying we need to say needless to say needless to say needless to say  needless to say oh dude you got to get some phrases in that's what you guys got to do all right what  oh oh that's right that's some phrases i want to say that we're bummed because we've been knocked  down to the second most outrageous radio stunt ever we're gonna get ourselves fucked i'm talking about 
[02:23:00]  a bad thing look you guys put up enough money not that i need the money but just just for the  goof factor you put up enough money when she like asked that first question that's really serious  i'll i'll do obnoxious laugh man no no  she's dead you see yeah you you want to see which what words we can at least get in like i'll i bet i'll  slip in frunkus and make it sound normal you can get if you get a frunkus in there i will get a 
[02:23:30]  frunkus in there this is what we call um a frunkus um i was thinking maybe a name it's like tragically  if you remember years ago this happened to a dj named uh bill frunkus uh but the woman didn't die  so it's uh there has been a precedent in this um frunkus incident well alison we uh recently held 
[02:24:00]  our eggnog drinking contest yes we could have had uh similar results but we were responsible  broadcasters blah blah blah you know uh you have to make sure there are emts on site  so that if uh any of the um contestants get in any kind of medical distress there is somebody there  a professional that can care for them because we are but stupid shock jocks right we know not of  the medical profession uh we're getting help from the instant feedback oh good um alison our thoughts 
[02:24:30]  and prayers go out to jennifer and her family yeah thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers this is a  trying time for the family and i suggest that maybe maybe someone out there should just buy the kids  a wee at this point we would like to offer we you know there's little we can do now  they've lost a parent but we would like to buy a wee for the children someone is suggesting god we got  some old school listeners that we use some psycho mark lines go f yourself no the whole uh 
[02:25:00]  uh they're not gonna be out of work uh too long i picture these guys people showing up for a fact  they're talking with clear channel as we speak and i'll be back on the air shortly  how is it that um a mere couple of years after we are the assholes and everyone in radio is is being  interviewed on our radio demise that we now have to fucking get on a tv show and talk about some other 
[02:25:30]  shows fuck up  yeah i'm i think i have a moral problem with this  i think there's a bit of hypocrisy  if you recall we sat there and just said listen to these motherfuckers judging us  who the fuck is uh a grease man to get on and talk about uh our career well i think uh you know as  you know i got in a little bit of trouble myself here yeah you know and we were talking about other 
[02:26:00]  jocks man douche he got on yapping about us yep yep yep yep yep all of us though but all of them by  the way said we would never work again right uh we were blackballed yeah black but not the way you  know jimmy was that night in the car in the saturn when you paid good money for what you thought was a  girl reached your hand down and got blackballed long way to go just a tad needless to say needless 
[02:26:30]  to say oh you guys please needless to say needless to say thoughts and prayers thoughts and prayers  needless to say needless to say that's terrible i'm sorry  that's terrible i'm sorry i'm sorry  yeah had she died i mean for the rest of their lives these poor kids people can be going how did  your parents die how did your parents everyone wants right right how did every day lately we're  having uh uh people ask where did frunkers come from it was just a noise that jimmy i get a lot of 
[02:27:00]  emails it's actually it's it's an old danish uh phrase a lot of people remember the whole the  whole front like fan called frunkers incident it's not worth getting into like if you see her ask a  question opie maybe starts answering and i just cut in and go no nothing's wrong  just stay in the living room i'll handle it  so now you guys have you ever done anything where you feared for the uh lives of uh your  contestants no no no no no no no no  how would you feel if you did do something like this that that's terrible i'm sorry sorry 
[02:27:30]  it really is terrible terrible i'm sorry oh my god please say that well good luck bro  get a good luck bro in there remind everyone that radio is theater of the mind  theater of the swollen mind poor poor girl the hell are we gonna say um i think what we stick to  uh i think condemning the show not good we will look silly because we are just as bad 
[02:28:00]  and and believe me over the course of this program over the years we have been doing it  i'm surprised we haven't racked up quite a body count but we can comment on  hmm nothing now we can comment on the fact that you know it was uh things like this happen it's uh  very unexpected uh you're you're there to entertain right and then we just try to fit in as many show 
[02:28:30]  references as is humanly possible while babbling about nothing or be just completely crass about it  well you know i mean we don't kill them we just get in the fuck each other in the ass  high five we just hear in the back high five  by the way um if you're just tuning into the opian anthony show we played the audio from the actual  show yeah that killed the woman uh so listen to the replay today someone wants us to do the 
[02:29:00]  interview in wacky dj voices oh thank you all so thanks for having us on msnbc yeah tragedy  in sacramento we've been reporting this story uh along with you as journalists  and just give her that angle  oh that's the great it's terrible jimmy uh hats from fba remind them that you're artists  all right you asked ah that's a good one we're artists one of the greatest tv moments ever i  actually told bill o'reilly that we're artists anyway you're you're what you're what you're artists

[02:32:30]  guys yeah she knows us damn it she did a whole piece on us once for uh some dumb show she was on  abc or something back then i think she's still there no it's msnbc now well i do a lot of impressions  i do larry king i do i do them all i do steve carr  let's say hi to leroy in baltimore leroy  like to plug  hey morning boy  my band  hey  how about doing nothing but answering questions with questions 
[02:33:00]  uh answering questions with questions like uh she says uh how do you feel  about um what happened do you do you think uh it was justified that they were fired  after uh this woman lost her life so should we be justified should should should we feel it was  justified all right we'll we'll have fun with that i mean we'll uh take it very seriously what  time is it 12 40 is it live or taped i think it's live live no she's not on a 12 40

[02:34:00]  in our ways of doing it and and uh using words that we use on a daily basis yeah well you  know your reputation precedes you enough you don't need to give them ideas of what you're  talking about it's not like we're gonna do silent game all right let's do something i will think  about it uh in the studio or outside the studio we got octane our boys from philly yes these guys uh  we go way back with them when we used to do road shows the first time we went down to philly they  warmed up one of our road shows and just completely kicked ass yep they were doing a lot of covers back 
[02:34:30]  then and but now we're discovering their origin their originals are just as good hell yeah it's  not better how about that if not better played right out on the street yeah the song they play  for us out on the street on the walkover i don't understand why radio is not playing it like crazy  that's uh ysp's playing it right oh cool and who else any other stations can we maybe turn their  mics on how does it go i saw the sign i can't get that out of my head dumb brood 
[02:35:00]  are the mics on uh you got me yeah mmr in philly's playing it as well there's some other stations  scattered throughout the uh country that they're playing it too but it's just a they're starting to  pick it up now and i think a lot of it primarily to do with here i know you guys definitely had a big  impact since since we did the show we've been getting sales from all over the place like places  that it never really yeah oh yeah can places on the other side of the country i mean everywhere  just very very cool stuff because that's how you got to make it these days because rock radio is 
[02:35:30]  going away stinks yep the internet that's the way man that's the way yeah and then you get these  record companies they're saying to you they're like you know if your records aren't in the stores  you're not going to do anything i'm like man people are buying it over the internet anyway they're  not nobody goes to a store anymore and if you sucked ass believe me no one would have been buying it  it's uh it's your guys credit it really sounded good a lot of people heard it and were like you know  where where the hell can i get this thank you so hey you guys on itunes at all yes we are  absolutely that's what drove tower records out of business so i mean people just not going to 
[02:36:00]  store but don't give a fuck about album artwork you know cd baby as well it's the same deal they  just go there and they buy and they don't even think voice about it i buy everything now online as  far as music goes i don't even buy the full the whole the whole cd you know what would have been the  cd boom download it's there it's on the ipod when i look at my cds and my uh my joint there  it looks so like out of date it's old foreign now yeah it's like oh god this clunky thing it's  like when you look at your videotapes like vcr tapes right right right the tower records where 
[02:36:30]  jimmy did the signing yeah for your uh for your hbo special just closed man uh it's creepy it's in  our neighborhood it's just a massive it's a huge empty warehouse don't need it anymore it's there's  not nothing left in this place i used to walk in there on the way home i'd stop in because i knew  they were closing they were going on business just to remember that signing day because they said  that was the biggest signing that they ever had at the store yep we had a line all the way down the  block and uh that was a great day so i kind of just go in there and go oh man fuck that was a 
[02:37:00]  fun day and i know they're gonna close it's depressing done yeah no we should have done we should  have done a bit where we had someone go into tower records every day to see what what crap was  no one was buying like the last few days yeah because they were like i mean because by the end  it was like 70 off 75 off and still people like i don't know man two dollars slim whitman two dollars  for pat benatar's greatest hits uh yeah a dollar i'd buy it a buck you guys want to play something

[02:42:00]  Enemy  Very nice  That was awesome  That's great  Need a little more guitar, they're saying on the instant feedback  Just a little more  Are you fix the, uh  Just slightly lower  Are they self-mixing?  Who's self-mixing?  You guys are self-mixing?  I think it's an important note for you guys to know  That the other, the reason the other two guys showed up today  Is because last time Norton called them Pete Best  Oh, and they're giving you the finger, Jimmy  Fucking Jimmy  I'm glad they're here now, they gotta be here  It's all bent  There you go 
[02:42:30]  Gotta be here, all bent  What do you want to play next?  We'll get another one out before we go to break here  Uh, you want something a little more melodic  Or something kind of along the same lines?  You want us to stretch a little bit for you?  Um  It's melodic  Really?  Whatever you want to play  No, what is melodic?  Melodic's cool  Melodic's laid back  But very, very rock and roll  Very deep  With the big chorus  And the big anthem  Theater  Blah, blah, blah, blah  Let me explain something to you  We're experts at dick jokes  You're experts at music 
[02:43:00]  And your band  So, whatever you feel would work  Alright  Alright, it's Octane from Philly  This one's called Confessions  Everything has changed 
[02:43:30]  The time it slips away so fast  Oh, so fast  Each day seems to be one to the next  Like one big blur lost in a mess  I confess I like it messy  All of my friends 
[02:44:00]  Have left me for dead  And I find myself believing  God's words have all been said  Oh, picture where he's red  Yet I find myself still breathing  But my heart's still beating  Everything around me seems to change 
[02:44:30]  Except for me, I stay insane  I'm to blame when there's a blaming  I tend myself inside of me  I guess it's just too much  So I am obsessed  I confess I like obsessing  All of my friends  All of my friends  Have left me for dead 
[02:45:00]  Yet I find myself believing  God's words have all been said  Oh, picture where he's red  Yet I find myself still breathing  My heart's still beating  And I never know what to expect 
[02:45:30]  Try to live my life without a regret  Having to complain  I must confess  I must confess  Like a blessing  All of my friends  Have left me for dead  And I find myself believing 
[02:46:00]  All of my friends  All of my friends  Have left me for dead  Yet I find myself believing  God's words have all been said  Oh, picture where he's red  Yet I find myself still breathing 
[02:46:30]  My heart's still beating  All of my friends  Have left me for dead  All of my friends  Have left me for dead  All of my friends  Yet I find myself believing  All of my friends  Have left me for dead 
[02:47:00]  My heart's still beating  All of my friends  All of my friends  All of my friends  Art Ting, once again, very, very good  Do you guys have CDs with you?  That's it?  You have CDs with you?  Yeah, yeah  Oh, cool  All right, really?  I'll put that in my iPod  I only have one problem  Why do we have to look at your ass  while you're playing?  Why couldn't you guys be facing us?  Oh, see, my problem is  why didn't the rest of them turn around?  They had a bunch of nice asses to look at  We had this huge, like, window in front of us 
[02:47:30]  where we could see  kind of where the studio audience sits  and that's where they set up  because the whole band is here  and, you know, XM promised us  for a couple years  they were going to build this studio  We gave up on that  Building it out  so we could actually be in the same room  with the bands and stuff  That'll happen  And they set up in such a way  where we get to see your ass  as you're saying  That's lovely  And the other thing  XM contacted you guys?  Are you on XM?  Nope  What the fuck?  The unsigned channel has not contacted us  Do we have one anymore?  I don't know if there's an unsigned channel anymore  That might be a reason 
[02:48:00]  No, but there's a channel that does play  Of course there is  XMU's still not?  Huh?  XMU, right?  XMU, maybe?  They should be added immediately  It's still available  Yeah, let's call them  Don and get their songs on the radio, please  on XM in a nice little rotation  Hell yeah  I deserve it  And what's the plug again?  The plug for the website?  Yeah  OctaneRocks.com is our website  MySpace backslash OctaneRocks  is the MySpace  And tonight we're going to be at  Don Hills at Greenwich and Spring

[02:55:30]  He was looking for a soul to steal  This is  Yeah I remember this  I actually like this  This was never on the fucking radio  How about Long Hair and Country Boy  This one might have been on the radio  I like that  This probably was  Skinner 
[02:56:00]  Yeah no kidding  That's the Skinner sound  I know  You say I'm no good  Oh I've heard this  Yeah  Crazy as a lynching  One of those drinking songs  Cause I get stoned in the morning  And I get drunk in the afternoon  Kinda like my old blue tick hound  I like to lay around  Yeah I remember this  And I ain't got no money  God damn  I'm enjoying Charlie Daniels  You like this  Oh listen 
[02:56:30]  Yeah I know this one  This one's on the radio  If I can't get it on my own  This is nice  Fuckin' my white hillbilly  Don't like the way I'm livin'  You just leave this long-haired country boy long  Half a Hulk face is cool  Oh no  Half a Hulk nut is cool  That's alright  That's nice  Jimmy's getting turned on to some new music 
[02:57:00]  This song's what, 30 years old?  Oh is it old?  Yeah  I'm enjoying this  Reach a man talking on time  He's a no  My chick likes country  Charlie  Oh yeah?  Sucks  Yeah  I'm enjoying it  We'll drive around  And she has awful taste in music  My girlfriend's tasting music  Her ear should be cut off  She likes fuckin' R&B  She loves R&B  Which I hate  Yeah  And that and country  You wanna talk about opposite ends of the spectrum  So I like the country I'll take  No  You'll take the country?  Yeah  Some country's alright  See that wasn't like considered country back when I was growing up 
[02:57:30]  There was southern rock  Right  And that was part of it  Even that song  Southern rock is no country  Like a mellow southern rock thing  And that included Charlie Daniels  Marshall Tucker  Did I mention Charlie Daniels?  What do they sing Marshall Tucker?  Leonard Skinner  Marshall Tucker did  Let's not even go through it  I'm not answering  Look up Marshall Tucker on iTunes when you get home  You really don't know Marshall Tucker Band?  No, I know the name  They probably have songs you'd recognize 
[02:58:00]  Before you would recognize a Charlie Daniels song  Marshall Tucker Band had many more radio hits  Yeah  Which one?  I'm sure I've heard them  I just don't know by name  Give us a Marshall Tucker hit  Alright  I bet for years we'd hear them in school  Like the Marshall Tucker Band  Well let's go with the first 30 years  Jesus  Yeah, exactly  30 years  Exactly  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-bang-a-bang  If I remember this one  Can't You See  Blue Moon  Yeah, Can't You See was a huge hit on the radio 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, Can't You See was a big one  Give us a little Can't You See there, Bill  What else?  Heard it in a love song  Was big on the radio  Oh, the live version  That probably goes on for an hour and a half  Let's see  There's not many others actually  Now that I'm looking at the list here  Another band with a flute  But it was, you know, Southern Rock with a flute  Right, right  One of their mellower  A flute  Yeah 
[02:59:00]  Gets off the tour bus with his little flute case  Jesus  I gotta haul this?  Where's my roadie?  Smuggles his own instrument in his asshole  Probably put it down his pants leg  Hoping that the groupies would think it's just a big cock  The obligatory guitar lead before the vocals come in  They'd give a little riff  No one has attention for this anymore  Back in the day, kids  This was like any other 
[02:59:30]  We had a bigger attention span  Where we would listen to the guitar solo for a while  This was like any other type of music  Hairband music, everything  It had its moment  And then there were a bunch of people  That kind of just kind of  Gonna take a freight train  Picked up the sound  Down at the station  I don't care  I'm just staring at Jimmy  You don't know this song, do you?  I don't know  But I like it  I like this stuff  This has been played on the radio  I'm sure I've heard it  Ad nauseum  Ad nauseum  I always say ad nauseum 
[03:00:00]  What do you think?  Ad  Oh yeah  Sounds like Creedence  They were popular, right?  Marched for years  And is Fluke Guy done?  What happens to Fluke Guy?  At that point, he better pick up something else  Or he's gonna be out of work  A triangle  Pick up something, Fluke Guy  What do you do if you're Fluke Guy? 
[03:00:30]  You do your part  You're on stage  Now what?  You just stand there  You gotta stand there and tap your foot  But how do you look busy?  Rock your head back and forth  With your cowboy hat on  Do you run and fill up everyone's Jack Daniels?  Yeah  You run errands  You run errands?  He's like the Club Soda Kenny for the band  He can just play a little flute  And then he runs off and gets some fruit  Do you think Fluke Guy just walks off?  Gets the smoothie  I hope so  He'd look awkward just standing there  What does Fluke Guy do? 
[03:01:00]  I've heard this  The tail end of Southern Rock  With bands like Molly Hatchet  Yeah  Who started picking up on things like that  And had their  And everyone had a  Had a whistle in the song  A little whistle action  Yeah  Boy, did my flute joke bomb, by the way  Oh, did it?  Wow  Which one?  What happened?  It didn't even laugh  No one responded  That a person had talked  Are you kidding?  Oh, that was okay  I said  You said he was coming off the tour bus  I said he smuggles his own instrument in his asshole 
[03:01:30]  That's funny  We didn't hear it  I was  Sorry  I just fired up  Great visual  I'm sorry  Oh, I just got insecure  Walking off a tour bus with a flute in his ass would be funny  That's right  And speaking of shoving things up your ass  Let's say hi to Buck Angel  Ah, what a segue, Opie  Thank you  Buck Angel  On the Opie and Anthony show  What's up, Buck?  Hey, nothing  How's it going?  Wow  Well, our pal Jimmy Norton  Ran into you at the porn convention  Out there in Las Vegas, Nevada  Hope he didn't run into him 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, I remember actually  And  Nothing  And then he brought back pictures of you  And I gotta be honest  Never heard of you  Never seen a picture of you before  But we're beyond fascinated  Steve came running in all giddy  Yeah  No kidding  I was summoned  Don't lie  You have videos in your house  I'm sure you have one of my videos  Under your bed somewhere  I'd love to see one now  To be honest with you  We  I had heard of you  But I've never seen any of your stuff  And I was the little small guy  And Steve is the guy next to me  That was  We were talking about doing films  Wow  Okay 
[03:02:30]  Yeah  Like he hasn't done a few  How many films have you done, sir?  I've done  Seven films  Seven films  That's it  And basically  Yeah, not very many  I'm actually very picky about what I do  Because everyone wants to put me in all their videos  I want to have total control over what I do  Ah  I know you guys probably think I'm a freak  But I'm not really a freak  And that's why I try to maintain control over what  No, because you know  When I read The Man with the Pussy  The first word that comes to my mind is not freak 
[03:03:00]  Really?  Nah  That's cool  I appreciate that  Nah  We've seen the photographs  I've never seen a movie  But we've seen the photographs  Well, I'll have to send you guys a movie then  And then you can review it and tell me what you think  Yeah, we'll do that right away  Now, the pictures of you  Just to describe to the listeners  Because maybe they didn't hear us talking about you the other day  You look like a biker dude  No hair  Like just rocking the skull 
[03:03:30]  Right  Lots of tattoos  Yeah  And you're missing a penis  I'm missing a penis, yes  But I enjoy my pussy  That's the most important thing  See, it's a complete muscular man's body  Yes  And a man's face  You would think, you know  If this guy pulled up on a Harley  He's another biker guy  The last thing you're thinking is  This guy has a pussy  Right  And he's got a pussy  Right  And now  What are you exactly?  What were you born?  How did you get this way? 
[03:04:00]  Well, I was born female  And I had a sex change  I'm a female to male transsexual  I'm actually the opposite of  I'm sure you know she-males  Which are basically chicks with dick  Jimmy does  I'm the opposite of that  I was born a female  I had a sex change to a man  What do they do to make it  I mean, like  Because, I mean  Some people say that  If you start with a penis  You turn it into a vagina  I mean, that makes you a silly goose  I mean, did you start  Like, how did they make it  It's just like a vagina  With a big clit  Do they stretch your clit a little bit?  No, no, no, no  It's all natural  I have had no surgery 
[03:04:30]  From the waist down  Oh, cool  You do have a very nice vagina  If I may  Thank you  I appreciate that  I work hard at that  Did you feel like  You were a guy growing up?  I don't get this  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Help me out here  You know, come on  You've seen many stories  On Discovery Channel  Or wherever  About people who just  Always feel like  They're in the wrong body  I mean, it's  It's pretty out there now  It's not something like  You know, in the closet anymore  I've always felt like  I was a guy  Growing up  Yeah, we saw a picture  Sorry?  We saw a picture of you  As a woman  Right 
[03:05:00]  And how old were you  Living as a  Completely as a woman?  Oh, I was in my 20s  Before I decided  To have a sex change  And I was actually  A female model  I was doing modeling  As a woman  Which was very difficult  For me to do  Because I felt like  I was a guy  And I was, you know  Putting makeup on my face  And going, you know  To Europe  And doing fashion shows  And all that  I've got to tell you, man  Your face as a woman  Yeah  Right on, man  You're very pretty  You were pretty  I can't believe you'd want to  Change the whole look around  And go from that 
[03:05:30]  To a biker dude  Because you had a beautiful face  I mean, what I see  In your modeling picture  Your old modeling picture  You kind of have like  Manly hands  Yeah, I was  Because I was a manly  Kind of woman  You know, I didn't even have  A very feminine body  But wouldn't  I mean, doesn't that make you  Think that I was that  Desperate to have a sex change  If I was a good looking  Female  You know, why would I go  And change myself  To this kind of looking guy  You're a big clit  Yeah, I had a big clit  I like that  As a woman, I had a big clit too  So it was, you know  The hormones helped that a little bit 
[03:06:00]  No, but your face is a woman  Beautiful  I got, you know  And as a guy  Whatever, people are into that  So what can I tell you  You're a biker dude now  I have a big fan base  Of people  Most of my fan base  Happens to be men, by the way  Gay men  But I do have a pretty large  Women fan base  Gay men  But you grow the beard  And everything, man  It's so weird to know  That you started as that  And now you're a biker dude  With a beard  A biker dude  And how do they  How do they get your  Your chest to look manly  Like, do they just 
[03:06:30]  Suck out your boobs  No, actually they didn't  Because I didn't have  Most boobs are like fat  And I didn't have a lot  I didn't have big boobs  They just did  A really good surgery  And I work out very hard  In the gym  And this is all natural  Yeah, you look like  You have a guy's chest  I mean, you want to look at it  You want to look at it closely  And go, well, I can see  The hint of him being  A female in a past life  Now, you're attracted to  Guys, girls, gay men  Or gay women  All of the above  Everything  I like that  Why should I limit myself? 
[03:07:00]  Ah, there you go  If it has genitals  You'll fuck it  Exactly  What about animals?  No, no, no, no  No animals and kids  We don't go there  And the obvious question  So you go from  A woman to a man  Why not get the penis?  Because  And don't think  I didn't want to have one  But the thing is  The surgery is horrific  It doesn't work  I don't want to have  You know, a dick  That hangs between my legs  And doesn't get a heart on  What's the point of having one?  Well, how do they make a dick?  Pumps  It's really unbelievable  The surgery  They like rip part of your arm off 
[03:07:30]  And take tendons out  And take skin grafts  And they mold it into this penis  That doesn't particularly look  Very nice for me  Some guys like me  Want to get it  Because they feel like  They need to have  The penis to be a man  I don't particularly think  I need to have a penis  That bad to be a man  I have like seven dildos  In my drawer  And it stays hard all night  You know  And I'm married to a woman  And she's totally happy  And I don't have any issues with it  Wow  Wow, you're married?  Yeah, I'm married  Did not know that  Legally?  Legally, I am legally a male 
[03:08:00]  Yes, I had a legal sex change  I had my birth certificate change  My passport change  All my documents change  Wow  But you can pee standing up?  I can pee standing up  Yes, I can  Okay  That's kind of important  You know  Because you go into the bathroom  Well, you know what?  I know guys that go  You know, genetic guys  That go in the bathroom  And go in the stall  And sit down  I mean, you know  Sometimes you want to sit down  Because you're tired  Or whatever  Do you know how popular  You'd be in prison?  You know what?  They would actually stick me  In the woman's prison  Because of my genitals  Even though I'm 
[03:08:30]  Even though I am legally a man  They would stick me  In a woman's prison  You'd be fucked out  In the first week  I wouldn't want to  Go to the men's prison  I think it would be pretty scary  Like, hey, I'll spot you lifting weights  Hey, he's fucking me  Jesus Christ  That is something  Because I've heard about the female to male  And seen a few of them  But never seen the genitalia  And never saw somebody  Who is actually an attractive woman 
[03:09:00]  Turn into a guy  That you would see walking down the street  And wouldn't give a second look at  Because it's just another guy  Walking down the street  Yeah, I mean, I think that's what makes my change  So much more drastic for people  Is like, why the hell would you go  From this hot woman  To this ugly guy  And it's like  Because it was  It was a desperate situation for me  I was not happy living as a woman  It just was really not a good situation  Did you just love the cock as a woman?  Actually, no  You know, I was probably considered  A lesbian as a woman 
[03:09:30]  I was much more into men as a woman  I mean, into women as a woman  Now I'm women  He's even confused  Into women as a woman  I fuck everything now  I don't even know what gender is  What type of guys  Like  I don't get  What type of guy  Wants to fuck you?  Yeah, that's a good question actually  Thank you  Mostly it's gay men  And I think because they  Maybe at some point in their life  Wanted to try to fuck a vagina  But they're not attracted to women  So, you know  Basically what it is now 
[03:10:00]  Is I'm a guy with two holes  I just, you know  It's just a hole  That's all it is  That would kind of be like  Scarlett Johansson  Has a dick  Oh, please  Would you fuck her in the ass?  Yeah  Yeah, you would  Don't lie  I'd let her fuck me  Now here  I think females are so popular  Because they're hot  I mean, some of those girls are amazing  You would never know in a million years  That they had a cock between their legs  I mean  Well  Let me ask  I have two questions for you  One  There was one 
[03:10:30]  One training that was with him  That I wanted to get to walk to car  Because I've never seen  Who were some of the transsexuals  That were standing over in that area with you?  Oh yeah  That was Wendy Williams  Who I've done a movie with  So we did a totally mind fuck movie  Where we fuck each other  And you know  It's like  From the waist up  From men and women  And then from the waist down  It's like  What the hell's going on?  And then the other girl was Holly  She was  Both of those girls were also nominated  For the Avian Award  Like I was  Now which one looked really like  Really  There was one that looked nothing like a woman  I don't even go there with me 
[03:11:00]  I'm not  I'm not answering that question  Okay, let's say  How about this one?  There was one who was  Blonde hair  But kind of rugged looking  She looked kind of rugged  Holly  The one with the huge boobs  I mean  Her boobs were like  Out of control  No, no  This girl had a very  A pink top  Steve is saying  I think that's Wendy Williams  Maybe  Alright  Hey Buck  Shane from Tennessee  Wants to know  If you can get pregnant  Still  Everyone always asks me that question  Nope  Because I have been taking testosterone  For 15 years  So it shut everything down 
[03:11:30]  I don't get my period anymore  Do you still have  We were wondering that too  Because we were seeing  This man's body  Like the upper chest  And the face  And Anthony pointed out  There are ovaries  Inside  There's got to be ovaries  In there  In a womb  Yeah, exactly  But they're all  You know  It's like a haunted house  It's totally a haunted house  It's all like spider webs  And everything  They're dried up like raisins  And nothing  Exactly  No wigs  Hey, congratulations  The AVN 2007  Transsexual performer  Of the year  By the way

[03:19:00]  Oh no  No kids  No kids  I'm actually going to  Probably have a hysterectomy  Here soon  Because like you said  It's all haunted house  Down there  Really  Get rid of it  Yeah  It's going to have it  Yanked out like an old tooth  Yank it out  Tie a string around it  And around the doorknob  And just slam it shut  Wow  That's pretty wild man  That's alright  Maybe we'll see you in New York then  How much can you  How much can you bench  300  Holy shit  Can you really  Oh yeah  That's  Let's have a benching  Science is fucked up  He started as a woman

[03:26:00]  Weigh E-Rock  They got a hundred dollars  Still want to weigh him?  Well you gave a hundred dollars  Right?  Last week?  I believe I did  Was it a hundred?  A hundred  A hundred  Wow  And you guys all guess  What he's going to be down to?  I've been drunk  Yeah we all picked out of a hat  Alright he gained 19 pounds  Over the holiday  He was 200  He was up to 219  We're like you're a fat fuck  You shouldn't be this fat  So we basically put the pressure on him  To lose some weight  So now we're paying attention to what he's looking like  And what he's eating  And we're weighing him on a weekly basis  Unfortunately the bit now sucks 
[03:26:30]  Because the first weigh in he lost 2 to 3 pounds  Right?  Yeah but that could have just been like morning  He didn't eat anything  It was  I don't know  When did we weigh him last Thursday?  Last Thursday?  Officially we did a preliminary  We did another one Monday  Oh yeah we surprised him on Monday  And what was he down to?  216  216 right?  216  See he looks thinner  And he's wearing black  To make himself look thinner  He's very conscious of his  Of his weight gain now unfortunately  Yeah  We got $100 up for grabs  Did you have another marshmallow Sam? 
[03:27:00]  He loves his marshmallows  I like him in cocoa  The mini ones  Just don't grab them  You can't fucking stop  Every time he comes into the studio now  He grabs the chubby bunny marshmallows  And just like starts devouring them  It's open and it's right there  Sam let me tell you a little something  Oh you're entitled to some sweets  You have the same body type that I used to have  But now that I'm 30  My metabolism has changed to the point  I can't just grab in marshmallows anymore  Marshmallows 
[03:27:30]  Well  I only got a few years left till I'm 30 so  Yeah so enjoy them while you can  So enjoy it  Cause your metabolism is still very up there  Or whatever  It's like a little kid  Marshmallows  Where are the cookies?  We hired kids around here  I know we hired a bunch of fucking kids  Half these guys weren't even like born when we started together  Started?  Jesus Christ  Born like when we got fired  Children  I know  They're 3 years old  4 years old  Honestly let's figure this out 
[03:28:00]  How old are you Sam?  I'm 23  23  So when Anthony and I started back in 94  That's a little over 12 years ago  You were 11 years old  Oh my god  He was 11  Eating little marshmallows  Back then it was the mini marshmallows  Mini marshmallows  That's where the marshmallow habit started  He had like one of those  Probably for good grades  Play school  Mommy made cocoa with marshmallows for him  He had a play school camera  That couldn't break  Big heavy plastic thing 
[03:28:30]  A Mr. Microphone  And a plastic camera  Me wanna do radio  Wow  Okay he's 11  Not retarded  Alright so  Someone set up this bit here  We got $100  You guys all guess what  E-Rock would weigh obviously  It's as easy as that  Okay good  Than is handing me the weights  People are playing at home  And on pal talk  And on the instant feedback  E-Rock  Okay wow  Alright so Monday  E-Rock weighed 216 pounds 
[03:29:00]  Than says  He didn't lose another pound this week  He's still at 216  Travis says 214  Oh wow  He went with the dropping  Of a couple of pounds  Sam  Of course Sam  Said that he would gain a pound  Sam says 217  Just hoping  Danny  He lost another pound  I think that's a safe bet right there  I'm gonna go with Danny on this  Losing  One pound  Yeah one pound  I might go with Travis with two  Two  Travis did you give him your AIDS  Is that  And he dropped a few 
[03:29:30]  Derek  Derek says  That he gained two pounds back  Since Monday  And Bill  Says 213  So that means  He lost three pounds  Bill asked  What planet is he being weighed on  Cause it's fucking Bill  He doesn't even get it  No  That's the scary part  He's just  Petrified now  Of hitting the wrong button  That's what we get out of Bill now  Utter  And pure  Fear  He just stared blankly at you  Voted most likely to kill us 
[03:30:00]  Congratulations Bill  I know  Congrats  For a second year running  Second year running  Yes  We're only a few days in  To this year  The guy most likely to go postal  Go postal  And kill the entire staff  Alright Iraq  If you will  It's time to weigh you  Once again here  Step up on the scale  I wish we had some wacky sound effects  Of springs going  Boing  Wouldn't that be funny  How about a drum roll  The morning rave doesn't need it anymore  I don't  To use that one  Do you want it  No I could give a shit  About a drum roll

[03:34:30]  That some people  Are so used to it  And accept it  That they think  Everything they're listening to  Is hack radio  Why can't it just be  You look at your friend  And call him a fat fuck  And say  Get on the scale  I wanna see what you weigh  You asshole  Right  And that  It's not a bit  It's not a fucking  There's no sponsor to it  It's not a thing  See this show  Is about kinda hanging out  And just doing what we do  To our own asshole friends  At home  I don't know what you do

[03:35:30]  We talked to Taylor Hicks  I think it was one of  Jay Moore's last appearances  On our show  Before he decided  That we suck  And that it's all about  Ron and Fez  With excuses like  He's not up at that time  And things like that  He's not up at that hour  He's on set  He's doing this  But he gives us a phone call  For five seconds  And then has to run  Off and shoot something  And then  I tune in Ron and Fez  There he is  In studio  Sitting there for hours on end  Can we pull the audio tomorrow 
[03:36:00]  And find it  Cause it's really  A real problem  We're  We're kind of into  The American Idol thing  And goofing on that  It's getting huge ratings  People are really  Checking out the show  In record numbers  And Stupid Us  We're like  Oh we want to get  Some of these contestants  On when they get booted  Or maybe even some  Of these awful singers  That we've already  Checked out on TV  Yeah  It's sort of a popular show  So we're like  Roland, Steve  Can you call the  American Idol people  And get that done  And that was when  They reminded us 
[03:36:30]  That Jay Moore  Called the publicist  For American Idol  A cunt  Do you think  She took it  The wrong way  I guess when  We were talking  To Taylor Hicks  Yeah  I gotta find the audio  I gotta hear it again  It's been a while  Can we get that  For tomorrow's show  Someone remind us  To play that as well  I believe what happened  Was Taylor Hicks  Was on  We were kind of  Having fun with him  Was he getting a little  Like he had to go  He was beyond cool  To be honest with you  He was really cool 
[03:37:00]  He was beyond cool  We heard a publicist  In the background  Kind of like trying to  Shush him around  Trying to wrap it up  Because we were being  A little blue  Well we were being us  A little blue  Sure we were being us  And that's when  Jay Moore said  You know  The C word  They shouldn't  To these publicists  She's a cunt  They shouldn't  You know  Cut it  And I rarely ask  A favor of the  One pest  But we're thinking  Flowers and lots  Of flowers  So many flowers  That it is obscene  Never happened  Why? 
[03:37:30]  Never happened  Why?  Because it's pest  They'd send  Fucking poison sumac  They could do a nice thing  Every once in a while  No they can't  So we're not gonna  Ask the pest  For help on this one?

[03:47:00]  I tried to break away  It ripped my soul astray  As it took away  The life I know  And I've never forgotten 
[03:47:30]  I've never forgotten  I've never forgotten  You left me this way  I've never forgotten  I've never forgotten  I've never forgotten  You left me this way  I have been there before  You write for the pain I've endured 
[03:48:00]  Never will I push you too far  I have my scars and I need you pure  Catch me, I'm falling apart  Catch me, I've an open mind  Will I ever be, ever see, ever need  Or will I wander blind 
[03:48:30]  And now the dream replays  But I have overgave  The life I know  I have been there before 
[03:49:00]  You write for the pain I've endured  Never will I push you too far  I have my scars and I need you pure  My life 
[03:49:30]  And I've never forgotten  I've never forgotten  I've never forgotten  You left me this way  I've never forgotten 
[03:50:00]  I've never forgotten  I've never forgotten  You left me this way  I have been there before  I have been there before  You write for the pain I've endured  Never will I push you too far  I have my scars and I need you pure
