<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a dramatic, over-the-top introduction about a virus, quickly transitioning into humorous banter between Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal (filling in for Jim Norton).  Anthony blamed a sore throat on plane germs, a claim Opie disputed.  A significant portion of the show focused on graphic details and audio/video of the "Baby Bird" incident – an eggnog drinking contest where Pat Duffy repeatedly vomited into another contestant's mouth.  Joe Rogan, present at the event, also contributed to the description.  Pat Duffy later received an internship with the show.  The hosts then discussed internet search trends, noting the surprisingly low ranking of "Christmas" compared to sexually explicit searches, and debated the merits of various gaming consoles, with Opie favoring PCs.

The show continued with Opie and Patrice sharing contrasting childhood anecdotes: Opie's privileged upbringing versus Patrice's impoverished background, including using a cement bag as a lunchbox and caddying.  Opie challenged some aspects of Patrice's account.  The conversation meandered through various topics, including a DJ who was shot, the upcoming "300" movie trailer (which elicited enthusiastic responses), and the planned "homeless shopping spree."

A substantial segment focused on the cultural appropriation of hip-hop by white artists, with Patrice arguing that white artists often commercialize and dilute genres originating in Black culture.  Specific artists like Will Smith and Eminem were discussed.  The conversation broadened to generational shifts in music preferences, citing rock and alternative rock as examples.  They discussed the decline of alternative rock radio and the rise of personalized music.  Popular internet searches, including those related to Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, a delayed NASA space shuttle launch (attributed to a cricket), and a Bollywood actress facing a lawsuit for an on-screen kiss, were also mentioned.  The hosts briefly touched upon a news story about a four-year-old accused of sexual harassment and upcoming appearances on *The Tonight Show*. Patrice shared anecdotes about his career and opinions on films like *The Exorcist*, *King Kong*, and *Orca*.  The "Homeless Shopping Spree" and "MacBook Karaoke" contest were promoted.

Another segment tackled sexual harassment, expanding into commentary on perceived societal changes affecting men, using pregnancy as a humorous example.  The discussion shifted to the perceived physicality differences in modern and past football. The four-year-old's "inappropriate physical contact" news story was revisited, prompting a humorous call from Frank in Brooklyn.  The hosts then presented their weekly football picks (sponsored by Dish Network), further discussed the four-year-old's case, and presented satirical "scary news teases," including one about crushed beetles in yogurt.

The "homeless shopping spree" segment involved a live interview with Big Red, a homeless man found near Penn Station.  His interview, featuring discussions about his alcoholism and family life, was punctuated by outbursts and interruptions from Big Red, the hosts, and staff.  Additional news teases (about a credit card unlocking ATMs) were presented.  The show concluded with announcements about their *Tonight Show* appearance and the cancellation of their "walk-over" segment due to cold weather. A caller challenged their humor about punching dogs, leading to a discussion about their comedy and Jim Norton's suspension.  A suspected prank caller also interacted with the hosts.


A segment delved into FCC regulations on obscenity and indecency, using examples from radio broadcast transcripts that resulted in fines.  These ranged from explicitly sexual conversations to suggestive comments to underage girls.  They debated the nuances of acceptable language and mentioned significant fines levied against stations.  A humorous anecdote about a misinterpreted Sam Adams beer commercial and a joke from a Jackass guest were also discussed.

The other major topic was Patrice's disastrous appearance on the Tyra Banks Show.  Patrice recounted his disruptive behavior, including making a guest cry.  Clips were played, showcasing his appearances.  The conversation became sexually explicit and offensive, focusing on Patrice's comments about Tyra Banks.  The self-centered nature of Tyra and her show was discussed, along with a rapper's use of racial slurs on a live broadcast.

Another segment featured a caller’s story about witnessing bullying and not intervening.  The conversation included racist and homophobic slurs.  A lengthy phone call with Bob Saget discussed his career, views on Hollywood, and his game show "1 vs. 100".  A significant portion focused on Big Red, with numerous callers making offensive and sexually suggestive comments.  Big Red eventually joined the broadcast, engaging in a conversation filled with insults and vulgarity.

Finally, a segment relentlessly teased Roland, a past television personality, about his weight, lack of confidence, and past appearances, using crude and offensive humor.  Speculation about a traumatic childhood was fueled by the hosts' mocking and sexually suggestive comments.  A tape of Roland's appearances was mentioned.  The hosts briefly touched upon one host's past relationship ("Heather") and an upcoming *300* screening, ending with a non-sequitur about a Russian worker at a Fruit Roll-Up factory and show promotions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.B., Anthony, and James Norton.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  Virus.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying.  Searching for the next victim until there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection.  It's already done pretty much all the damage it can.  It fills their veins and blood with their pure rage. 
[00:00:30]  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failures.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a war fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  Hee hee.  O.B.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton.  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. 
[00:01:00]  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  Well, with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's kind of funny.  The dramatic open to start this horse crap.  Yeah.  How dumb.  It's so dramatic and so important. 
[00:02:00]  And then it leads to nothing.  It just leads to disappointment.  Yeah.  Morning after morning.  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm ill.  Yeah, I got a goddamn sore throat from traveling, flying, flying germ factories.  It's amazing.  We invented flight.  And it's just, it's just a big illness tube that you sit in.  You sit in a big sick tube with sick people. 
[00:02:30]  The miracle of flight.  But isn't it, but isn't it possible you got sick of just being in West Palm Beach by somebody else?  I didn't see anyone coughing or sneezing on the plane.  I didn't have contact with anybody.  It doesn't matter.  And you're the only one that got sick on the plane.  Animals on the plane.  You and Jimmy.  Animals.  That's what flies these days.  Eh.  That's what gets on the planes.  You ever hear that?  It happens all the time.  Oh, uh, 20 people were sickened by some, uh, un-gaga-goo-goo disease because somebody in India got on, uh, with it. 
[00:03:00]  Wait a minute, dude.  Why?  Are you delusional?  Are you on, like, some kind of cold medicine?  I took the same flight with you and I didn't see any, any goo-goo people on our flight.  He just made up, he just made up a group that was on there.  The apocalypto people.  I saw, yeah.  I saw nothing but white people coming back from West Palm Beach.  I'm not talking about my flight in particular.  I'm just, I'm just talking about, it's like.  Oh, you're saying someone goo-goo people left something for you on the white people flight. 
[00:03:30]  They left it.  But what does that have to do with.  Maintenance couldn't vacuum it up.  But what, what does that have to do with you being sick today?  Because there's always sick people on the planes.  Yeah.  There's always just sick people.  Coughing.  You blech.  I'm just, uh, uh, hate them.  You really, you really do sound vulnerable.  I just try.  He's all trying.  It's best to be up with a soldier.  I'm the same way I'm sick too.  I'm going to the bathroom.  I wash my hands. 
[00:04:00]  I try to be, you know, courteous to people.  And they're just hacking in your face and coughing in their hand and grabbing doorknobs.  And what a bunch of frigging animals.  You didn't, you didn't get sick on the plane though.  Yes, I did.  No, you were getting, so you're.  On the way there.  On the way there.  All right.  Because I know you were starting to feel the, uh, sore throat and stuff when we were broadcasting  from West Palm Beach.  You sound like a jazz DJ.  Yeah.  Can you dig it?  I knew that you could.  Shut up, Billy Crystal. 
[00:04:30]  Oh yeah, baby bird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Patrice goes, uh, by the way, let's set the, let's set the table here.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's out there in LA getting ready for the porn awards.  I guess he's got some rehearsals or something.  I don't know.  I don't know how they prepare for the porn awards, but he's doing that today.  And, uh, and this, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  And Patrice sits down and goes, uh, what's this baby bird all about?  I'm like, ah, thanks.  Thanks for the support.  It's only the biggest thing we've done in the last two years.  You know, we think you're kind of close to the radio show, but I guess not. 
[00:05:00]  Dude, you up at, if I don't have to get up at six, it ain't going to happen, man.  It ain't going to happen.  I can't get up.  I understand, but there is like, uh, websites.  This thing is all over the place.  Somebody, that's why, well, at least I asked you.  At least there's, there's enough people that, that, that, uh, love you guys to tell me.  There you go.  Just keep an eye on that monitor.  Well, I wanted to set it up.  So could you pause before he sees what he sees?  Because we still got to try to do this, uh, and make this, uh, make sense for radio.  And there's maybe a few people out there that still haven't heard about this. 
[00:05:30]  What?  I'm trying to figure out, I'm trying to.  Patrice, we do the eggnog drinking contest every year.  Right.  Okay.  There you are looking at Pat from Minaki.  The champion.  He won again.  And I think he was, uh, attempting his 76 shot.  I'm not sure, but he set the record.  It's double shots of eggnog.  He did at least 75.  Okay.  And then it was, he was ready to just get rid of all the eggnog.  And he's, he's a diabetic.  So he's got to get the sugar out of him.  Oh no.  Uh, and by the way, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a professional because he doesn't stick 
[00:06:00]  his fingers down his throat, by the way.  He just, he just drinks until his stomach can't even hold any more liquid.  Okay.  So we had Joe Rogan in here and, uh, and then is important to this as well.  Joe Rogan goes, I got an idea.  Cause people were puking like crazy during the contest.  We had this guy, Pat Duffy.  Uh, Joe Rogan suggested that we get one of the contestants to lay back, have his head over  a garbage, uh, pal.  With his mouth open.  With his mouth open.  He's sitting in a chair, kind of picture how, you know, you get your hair washed before a  haircut.  Right. 
[00:06:30]  And then, uh, Pat would, uh, would start, you know, would puke to get rid of all the  eggnog right onto this kid's, uh, head, his hair and in his mouth.  So Joe Rogan comes up with the idea.  With then goes, uh, why don't we call it the baby bird, baby bird, you know, how they're  fed by their mommies.  Oh man.  And he actually agreed to it.  Yeah.  And here we go here.  Uh, here's the video.  We're kind of screening it here.  It's going on his last shot.  He doesn't quite make this one.  Look.  And here's the first. 
[00:07:00]  That's nothing.  That's just that he's just getting started.  Just getting started.  It becomes a fire hose.  Yeah.  So, so far.  Look at his mouth is open and there it goes.  No, that's nothing.  That's a, that's a, that's some good volume right there, Patrice.  That's the third puke.  Oh my God.  Third puke's still nothing.  Oh man.  This is where it starts getting good.  Now it starts getting good.  Here's the fourth puke.  Oh.  Yeah.  The fourth puke.  That's a good one.  Completely destroys his face.  There's the fifth puke.  All without sticking fingers down his throat.  No.  He's a professional. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Patrice, he's not done yet.  He's puked five.  There's six.  Look at the volume on the, on the sixth puke.  Just amazing.  Almost looking like a bucket of eggnog just being poured on the guy's head.  Oh my God.  Just covered.  I think he's got one more in him.  And he's got the seventh and I think final puke to get rid of the eggnog for the eggnog drinking contest.  Yes.  Yes.  There it is, Patrice.  The baby bird.  There it is.  Seven pukes.  That beat the mousetraps. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, please.  Oh, yeah.  Please.  This is the.  I've never seen throw up like that before.  No.  Yeah.  Just projectile fire hose.  And there he is, a close up.  And look at this idiot.  It.  Yep.  You know, it almost looks like it could be.  No idiot, my friend.  That's Pat Duffy.  It.  That's Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Say his last name, too, to help his.  Well, Pat Duffy, the idiot.  Well, the kid was a real trooper and now he's going to intern for the show in January.  So, you want to hear the audio from the baby bird?  You said that was such lucky him. 
[00:08:30]  He got thrown up on his face.  Well, you know.  Now he gets to have throw up, you know, as his existence.  Now he gets to clean it up.  He's going to be known as a throw up guy, yes.  You know, he's trying to get into broadcasting and he won an internship with the show.  And we just happened to have this eggnog jerking contest.  So, we just threw it all in a bowl and mixed it up and came up with something.  The video's up on Break.com, GorillaMask.net, OpenAnthony.com, YouTube. 
[00:09:00]  It's everywhere.  Break.com alone, 1.2 million views.  That's what I was looking at.  1.2 million views.  Here's the audio because the audio is just terrific, too.  He's just drinking now.  He's up to 76.  Uh-oh.  Here we go.  Here it goes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The baby bird is going down.  The baby bird is happening.  The baby bird is happening.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It's so loud.  It sounds like a shooting.  It was right in here?  Yeah.  It was so stark.  No way did that happen.  With each wave, he got more enthusiastic.  No way did that just happen. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, we were just stunned.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my stomach and eggnog.  I almost wet myself.  I swear to you.  I'm laughing so hard.  I have never.  We lost Jimmy.  He's laughing so hard.  He went into the corner.  Yeah.  He's got the current race.  A thunderous round of applause. 
[00:10:30]  Down goes Pat.  Down goes Pat.  He's wearing puke blackface.  That was the greatest moment in radio history, period.  Yeah.  It's impossible to top that.  Yeah.  It's impossible.  That's going to be really tough to top.  We had, Patrice, at least 30 people in this room, maybe more.  It sounds like a lot of people.  I started looking around again in this empty studio, just picturing.  I mean, we had like 10 or 15 guys only back here alone, and then we had like 10 contestants  and guys with cameras over here and people on the couch. 
[00:11:00]  And Rogan was there?  Yeah, Joe Rogan.  He brought all his mass murders with him, too?  No, no.  Didn't have the hit squad with him this time around.  No.  But, you know, he's done the fear factory.  He said he's never seen anything like that in his life.  So we impressed Joe Rogan, which is pretty cool.  Yeah.  Can I get a password for this?  Does somebody have a password so I don't have to stare at a blank screen?  Yeah, can somebody get Nancy Grace her password, please?  It's some goddamn...  I know.  Oh, no, Rita and Rita Cosby. 
[00:11:30]  Rita Cosby.  Oh, my God.  I need a password.  Jesus, Scatman Crawlers.  Somebody get him a password.  It's Scatman.  Yeah.  Actually, I was a jazz player in New Orleans.  I was a jazz artist in New Orleans.  Just relax, dude.  I got my saxophone.  Be awful.  Yeah, let's be honest here, man.  Ant's miserable.  He's got a sore throat.  I'm so miserable. 
[00:12:00]  He's convinced some goo-goo people or whatever got him sick on a plane somewhere.  Yeah, it's always something.  He wants to not look at a blank screen, and he's not going to take his coat off today to  do a radio show.  Because it was cold.  I get cold, and I'm sick.  It's getting a little warmer in here, actually.  Yeah, I'll take it off.  I take it off, like, after an hour of the show.  All right.  I do that.  All right.  There's somebody.  Somebody's going to crash their car this morning.  Can I get my password, please? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, I just need my password.  He's just miserable.  Aw, yeah.  Give me my password.  It's that funky time of the year.  Suck it up, soldier.  I do.  I show up.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's all I got to do.  Is it getting better or worse?  It's worse today than it was yesterday.  What kind you got?  Like a sniffer one?  It's sore throat, where you wake up in the morning, and it feels like a porcupine is in  your throat. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, just sore throat?  No stuffy.  Sore throat.  Not really stuffy.  You all right, then.  It's just like, yeah, but I do radio.  Talking helps.  Hey, don't get sarcastic with me, man.  The ability to speak.  I'm just trying to care a little bit.  I know.  He's miserable.  He's going to take that out of us.  He's like, I do radio, fat boy.  Jeez, I'm trying to just be friendly, no password.  Sit there with your fire throat and burn.  I can care less about your inflamed Adam's apple. 
[00:13:30]  You're right.  He was just trying to be a nice guy and feel for you a little bit.  I've got my own problems.  Yeah, we all do, right?  I'm still living in a one-bedroom place with mice running around.  I haven't smelled anything in three weeks.  I was just bringing up the fact that you said it wasn't too bad, and I'm saying my job is  talking on the radio, and I can't talk.  So perhaps that is worse than it.  I mean, I got it.  You speculated.  What I'm talking about, here's what I'm talking about.  It was just the way you told them, though.  The bigger picture is the suffering we're talking about. 
[00:14:00]  I understand you talk on the radio, but I'm talking about the suffering as a human being.  I was trying to actually care about you as a human being to say, oh, it ain't that bad.  At least you don't have it all stopped up.  You understand?  I got you.  But I'm sure some dude driving a dumpster truck right now cares about poor boobie boobie  with his sore throat.  Oh, he's telling me to go F off.  I know.  He's out with somebody throwing out Pat from Unaki's garbage right now. 
[00:14:30]  And I don't know how long.  In 20-degree weather, by the way, here in New York City today.  And you're like, where's the heat in my password?  Somebody ought to beat you with a shovel.  You entitled, elitist bum.  You used to be one of the people.  I know.  No calluses left on your fingers.  You and your soft, manicured knuckles talking about where's my password?  I have a sore throat.  I do the radio.  You should have said hello at the end.  Hello, radio guy. 
[00:15:00]  Wearing the biggest and heaviest coat that you could buy, even though it's 60 degrees in  the studio.  Arctic, it's very cold out today, though.  He's got an Arctic coat on.  I've seen a guy out there right now in front of Dwayne Reeves washing the sidewalk.  That's what his job was today.  Washing the sidewalk in 20-degree weather.  And trying to figure out how to wash it before it freezes up.  Well, he is an ass.  I've got to get this water just right.  It's got to be at least 75 degrees because as soon as it hits the sidewalk, it's going  to start freezing.  My blue-collar story from 12 years ago ain't washing anymore. 
[00:15:30]  It's done.  Man, you really are, you just, you're a rich man.  You don't, just, just don't forget where you came from there.  You used to, your knuckles used to bleed.  You used to.  I remember I visited my old shop back about a month ago.  So I drove by and-  Did you go in?  Yeah, I talked to my old bosses and stuff.  Oh, just to rub it in?  Just like a man with a chip on his shoulder.  Not only did he go back to his old job site, he made sure he arrived in his Shelby. 
[00:16:00]  Well, I had to drive up in my Shelby.  Which was voted car of the year, by the way.  And that's why you're sick.  It's karma, you bum.  It's karma.  Patrice, he drives up in the Shelby.  They only made 22 this year.  He's got one of them.  He's got a few more.  He's got one of the 22 that have rolled off the assembly line.  You can drive all day and you're not going to see another one on the road.  He should have drove up with an air conditioner in the back and just thrown it right in the front of him. 
[00:16:30]  Just pulls up to say hi to the guys.  Oh, what a bum you are.  You've got to admit, part of that whole thing was you wanting to rub it in just a little bit.  Make it hurt just a little bit.  Maybe a little bit.  All right.  Maybe a little bit.  I know they listen to the show, they're hardcore fans, but you've got to be honest.  From some of your stories, I know that there's somebody out there that said to you many times,  you're a mountain nothing.  Oh, yeah.  I was one of those guys.  I know Opie's not one of those guys. 
[00:17:00]  No one's ever said you're a mountain nothing in Opie's life.  I can just tell.  I had my own problems.  Trust me.  We all got a problem, but never that one where you're just not going to mountain.  Get up and go to work.  Get yourself a trade because you're done.  You're going to be a construction guy your whole life.  Pick that up.  Bring it over there.  With the black stuff under the fingernails where something smashed it.  With a hammer smashed your nail and it's black.  And the blood has to grow out.  You've got to wait for the nail to fall off. 
[00:17:30]  Big Band-Aid around it that doesn't stay on for more than two minutes because your hands  are in water.  I had a teacher in high school that gave me an F-.  F-.  F-.  F-.  F-.  Wow.  Mr. I forgot that piece of garbage name.  Mr. Racist.  Yeah.  He just gave me an F- just because he's like, you're going to fail anyway.  So he thought it was funny to give me an F- for my piece of garbage.  I was really, really poor growing up.  I think where I lucked out.  No, where I lucked out though.  I'm not even just-  I'm not even-  I'm going to bet you on this one.  I don't believe you were poor.  I swear to God. 
[00:18:00]  We've told the stories over the years.  What kind of poor?  In the slums of Cinnaport.  Trust me.  Trust me.  Patrice, for the people that have been with us a long time, it'll take a ton of stories.  Poor enough for somebody to relate to your awareness.  How about poor enough where I didn't see a brand name label growing up?  It was all white boxes.  You don't see that now.  How about-  You dress just like you dressed when you was poor.  Yeah, because this is how I feel comfortable.  I don't give a crap.  That's what I'm saying.  That's not-  I don't give a crap. 
[00:18:30]  Name brand.  I just have-  I just don't have to worry about paying bills anymore and stuff like that.  But I dress how I feel comfortable.  How about poor enough where I had powdered milk growing up?  You ever have powdered milk?  I used to put milk in my- water in my cereal.  He wished he had powdered milk.  Are you serious?  I don't know powdered milk in the hood when you're poor.  You wasn't powdered milk poor.  Dude.  Powdered milk.  Poor people could even afford powdered milk.  It went for like two cents a box or something. 
[00:19:00]  I never had no powdered milk.  Where you had to like pour out the powder and then throw the water in it.  It was the most disgusting stuff on earth.  I think you were poor just without luxuries.  The luxury of regular milk.  Nah.  I was one of seven kids.  I took-  Thank you.  I took my lunch to school in a cement bag once because we wouldn't even buy like lunch bags.  So we-  Dude, the stories are endless.  How many-  Endless.  How many black people were in your school?  No, I was-  That's the gauge.  Honestly, I was in a really good school district, which made it worse because these people lived 
[00:19:30]  way above how we lived.  They were driving to school in these ridiculous cars and I, you know, I think I finally got  a car when I was a senior, but it wasn't a brand new one or anything like that.  It was a Dodge Aspen wagon that was about 20 years old or something like that.  Dude, the stories are endless.  But the point I'm making, where I lucked out was I went and caddied and made like ridiculous  money as a kid. 
[00:20:00]  Caddied, golf caddied.  Yeah.  And I was able to, you know, get, you know, enough money to pay for my own college and  then, you know, got into broadcasting all that.  Oh, poor baby.  No, I'm not crying.  I'm not-  Sound like you beat the Nazi concentration camp.  No, dude, I'm not-  I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me today.  The point I'm making is like, and I probably grew up about the same, you know, level, but  he went into it like, you had to do all these crappy jobs and I lucked out because I probably  would have had to done the same type of jobs, but there was a golf course close and I took 
[00:20:30]  a shot and went up there and I just lucked out because I lived close to a golf course.  Well, as a kid-  That's all I'm saying.  As a kid, my mom was able to bring us up.  We only had the three of us, you know, three kids and her.  So she was able to bring us up with, you know, name brand, Del Monte, you know, Del Monte  cans in there, not the regular labels that just say beets.  Oh, no, mine-  The white label, you know.  Ours said peaches.  We had green giant stuff.  Peaches and-  And Elio's pizza and all kinds of good stuff like that. 
[00:21:00]  Mine said peaches and black lettering and the rest of it was-  Yeah, the white label.  No, my mother would never buy that.  It was a big thing growing up.  She was yelling for you outside the window for the spaghetti commercial.  Anthony, always Ranzoni sonoboni.  Always Ranzoni spaghetti.  She was-  She always made sure, like, we had the best Christmas.  I don't know how the hell, you know, what the hell she was doing.  Yeah, we had two Christmases.  To make the money, but boy, we had great Christmas- 
[00:21:30]  Christmases.  Yeah, we asked how she made ends meet?  No, she was a waitress at a disco out in Long Island.  Cocktail waitress.  She looked-  That's how she did it?  My mother used to be hot.  She still is hot.  She made her big tips.  It was all on tips.  Oh, yeah.  Aunt's mom is still hot at her age.  She was doing-  I've seen his mom.  His mom is a cutie pie.  She was doing the cocktail waitress thing back in, like, the disco days.  So it was all just, like, these coked-out businessmen and everything. 
[00:22:00]  And, hey, Rosie, you know, and they'd slip a hundred.  She wasn't doing no, like, drug mules stuff or nothing?  I don't think any drug mules.  I don't think any prostitution or nothing like that.  Jesus.  I wasn't-  No, I wasn't-  Prostitute.  Aunt's mom has an unbelievable personality.  She has an unbelievable personality.  And, you know, it was probably known she's got some kids at home she's trying to raise,  and then these guys did the right thing.  They just, you know, trying to get in her little cocktail waitress outfit.  You think they were working it that way?  Oh, they were working it that way. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  What did your father do?  That's how they did it.  My father went out to California and got away from all of us.  Yeah, he went out there when he was, I guess, in his 30s.  He just left the family.  Yeah, he wanted to be a cowboy.  Yeah.  I think I like, I think I'm-  It's like family.  I didn't know about him.  Went out to be a cowboy.  But I went out there and lived with him for a while, too.  Oh, well, that's, that's, I was almost with you.  Yeah.  Nah, I went out there.  I actually grew up 10 blocks from my father and never met him.  Yeah?  Wow.  I found out some dude that I didn't like growing up was like half brother. 
[00:23:00]  Are you kidding?  Whoa.  Yeah.  Just a guy you hated?  Just some dude that I hated, right?  How bummed out were you when you were like, oh, I'm related to this guy?  I almost did some old white soap opera stuff.  Yeah.  My mother, you know, my mother was, she was young, you know, 21.  And I think my father was way older than my mom.  And she was like, I saw your dad today.  And I go, who, who's this person?  You know, I don't know no dads, you know?  So she goes, yeah, you know, a guy named, you know, Wiz. 
[00:23:30]  I got to change his name.  You know, a guy named Wiz.  I go, they call him Fat Wiz.  I go, yeah, I know Fat Wiz.  I don't really like him that much.  Well, he's your half brother.  So my father's living with the family of Wiz older than me and doesn't know that my mother was, like, side,  that he was cheating on his family and my mom's.  So I looked at him in the face and I almost was like, hey, man, you know, we're brothers, you know, 
[00:24:00]  on some old goofy stuff.  And then I was like, wait a minute.  Now, if I tell him, I'm going to have to tell him, too, that his father was cheating on his mom.  And I was like, I don't like you anyway.  And he's probably going to take it out on you.  Yeah, like, I'm like, what are you going to do now?  Extra, extra jerk-offs in my life.  Hey, hold that thought right there.  We're running a little late here.  We've got to step aside.  We have to.  We have lots to do today.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton.

[00:25:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  We've got Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton today.  Good morning.  Good morning.  And I was looking at this thing.  It's like the top internet searches.  And the top ten is a little weird,  but it also shows that the entire nation just loves sex. 
[00:25:30]  We just love sex.  Oh, yeah.  We love sex on the internet.  We love sex on the radio.  We love sex on TV.  We love sex in the office.  We love sex everywhere and anywhere.  I love that number one.  I don't know if you...  Number one.  Yeah, we'll get into that really fast.  I just want to quickly do the list.  I don't want to...  Number ten.  Top internet searches.  The word Christmas.  Of course.  Holiday season.  But what would you look up as far as Christmas goes on the internet? 
[00:26:00]  This has to be like all the...  I don't know.  The housewives or something?  Just Christmas?  Yeah.  That's like one of the top internet searches today.  Probably, you know, recipes, Christmas...  Anything that, you know, Christmas, holiday cooking, holiday ideas for decorating probably  just covers an entire...  But I guess what I'm getting at is like dudes are not throwing Christmas into a search engine  on the internet.  Well, what do dudes search...  That's why...  Read the rest and you'll see what dudes are looking... 
[00:26:30]  Well, I know.  I understand that.  That's why Christmas is number ten because look at what's number one.  All right, so Christmas is number ten.  Then you got the Nintendo Wii.  Do you got a Wii yet?  I didn't...  I haven't been able to...  The Wii.  I want to get it just to get it.  You know what I mean?  That was pretty good.  I don't want the Wii.  You don't want the Wii?  Nah.  PS3.  Some type of exercise going on with it.  What?  The Wii?  Yeah.  You got to do that with the hand thing.  You actually box.  You box them with the silly hand thing.  Yeah, you burn some calories, man.  Dan's got the Wii. 
[00:27:00]  I want it just to have it.  Yeah.  Just to know I can have it.  Well, that's...  And never use it.  By the way, PlayStation 3, only the 20th word thrown into the old search engine.  I think people have to be getting shot outside of Target and Walmart.  It's just kind of...  Yeah.  People are just like, it's not worth it.  People are going crazy over those things.  They just want it bad.  And Xbox 360 still hasn't worn out as welcome, and it's still a great game.  And we all enjoy that.  I mean, what does PS3 do? 
[00:27:30]  I guess that's a Laszlo question, but what does it actually do to make me want to buy  it over 360?  You know what I mean?  It does the same thing.  Yeah.  It is better, though, isn't it?  Just a little bit better than the Xbox 360?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not a console gamer.  I'm a computer gamer.  Excuse me.  Take your consoles and throw them out the window for all I care.  You use the Y button for run.  We may have an answer.  Yes, Dan.  Well, yeah, it came out a year later, so it is a slightly more powerful console, but  nobody can get them, so that's unpopular. 
[00:28:00]  But in terms of the power, it's slightly better.  But a lot of the games are on both systems now anyway, so.  Yeah.  I was looking at something.  They said they have to sell, they have to sell like 80 million for it to be a success.  What?  Like some ridiculous amount.  How is that possible?  Because they lost something.  Something happened with the computer chips, you know, I'm just, whatever.  And something happened, they lost like 300 million or something, and they spent like a  zillion dollars to do research for the PS3, and it's like they have to sell, they have 
[00:28:30]  to sell like 80 million consoles for it to mean anything.  Well, plus they lose money on every console they sell.  Because there's some technology that costs as much as the console.  They make all their money off the games.  The games themselves?  Yeah.  Ah, well, they'll be profitable.  I hope not.  They will.  Because I heard what they did to, you know, you heard what they did to 360 one time, is  like, or Xbox, when Xbox first came out, it was more powerful than the regular PlayStation. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  And they muscled all the, they muscled, I heard they muscled all the software people.  Yeah, to make it exclusive to Xbox.  But not even exclusive, but make it, like, don't make the games as good as you can.  That's why Microsoft games and Bungie games were so much better, like Halo was a Bungie  game, was so much better, because PlayStation was like, all right, look, if we let you have  same titles and all that, you can't make it better, as good as you can make it.  And since I heard that, it could be an urban legend, I was like, good, I'll PlayStation flops. 
[00:29:30]  That reminds me of the biggest disappointments when you used to, you know, play Pac-Man when  you're out, or Asteroids, and then, like, Activision came out, and they offered those  games, and you'd pop them in at home, and it was the worst version of, like, Pac-Man,  like this big, dopey Pac-Man, and it wouldn't work the same with this stupid controller, it  looked different, it moved different. 
[00:30:00]  Was that a copyright thing, because Atari did the same thing?  No, they just couldn't put that kind of software in a home system.  And, you know, your home television was pieces of crap back then, so you didn't get the resolution,  and you see the big, dopey screen, this slow-moving, wah-wah-wah-wah, Pac-Man.  How come they can't make, you're talking about the console, how come they can't make what  you play on, why don't they just, how come they just can't just put a joystick on that,  and then that's what we play with, call it PlayStation 4? 
[00:30:30]  PlayStation 4.  Like, why can't they just do that in a console?  It's the upgradability of computers that are great.  Like, if new games come out that use new technology, and you need a new video card, you know,  instead of having to go out and buy a new gaming system, you open up your computer, you pull  out the old video card, you throw it away, or if you need more memory, you go out and  you buy more memory, and your game runs smoother.  You can just update your own system.  And you do that up until the point where your computer can't take it anymore, then you 
[00:31:00]  throw that away, and you buy a brand new computer, and start the whole system over again.  You should, you know, Anthony, his system is so ridiculous, he's got these massive fans  and stuff that are cooling down the thing.  He's got a cooling room.  Sounds like a power plant in my house when I kick off my computer.  It's like turbo fans.  Anthony loves his computer.  I love that about, that's one of the things I like about being a dude, like, the one thing  is that we have so many void fillers. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's like, my birthday was yesterday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  So, I'm 37.  In white years, I'm 90.  I was going to say.  I'm 99.  I'm glad you did it to yourself, because I was going right for it.  Oh, man.  That's horrible.  I'm a 99-year-old white man.  It's in the life expectancy for you guys, like 33.  It's like, I really am.  I should have a cane right now.  You're an OG.  I really did live, you know, past where, you know, whatever. 
[00:32:00]  I don't want to die yet, too.  No, no, no.  It's not credit.  Two years ago, I'm like, baby, I'm ready to go out, baby.  You know, I'm standing on the thing with two guns, like, come on, kill me, baby.  But it's like, I still sit there, and, you know, you figure, you know how you, you know,  you're immature, grow up.  I'm just sitting there on my little chair playing, you know, Fear, or, you know, Rainbow 
[00:32:30]  Six.  Exactly.  It's just sitting there.  I was talking about how, you know, I was talking about on stage how guys, one of the good things  about guys that people just don't understand is that we just, we have no shame.  We have so much fun that means nothing.  Like, I daydreamed I was a Hall of Fame running back the other day for four hours, like, for  four hours, and I wasn't asleep.  It was a daydream. 
[00:33:00]  I was completely up.  Oh, is that great?  And I just was looking in the air, and I was shaking people, and I dripped.  I was this dude named, remember the dude from Role Warrior, the villain from the Role  Warrior?  Humongous?  The Humongous!  Humongous.  Lord of the Wasteland, Humongous.  The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller.  And so, I'm thinking I'm this dude named Humongous, right?  Playing football.  I don't talk.  No one knows.  I don't speak.  Someone found me, and they just unleashed me on football. 
[00:33:30]  Right, right.  I was this football player named Humongous, and I'm putting people in the hospital, and  people were, they trying to interview me, and I don't talk, and I wear a mask, just like  the Humongous.  And it's just a daydream.  For four hours, man.  And I just woke up out of that daydream, you know, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., and I didn't  go, what did I do with my life?  I just was like, ah, man.  You're like, hey, that's really good.  Man, I wish I could be the Humongous for real.  God, that is something, because in my old working days, I used to have to work in the 
[00:34:00]  shop sometimes.  Sometimes when you're not out on a job site, you'd have to work in the shop, and you'd  have to make the stuff that you would install the next day.  Right.  And there were these things called clinch collars.  They're little round things that you cut into the ducts that you then connect pipes onto.  Right.  It's like a little branch line.  So to make these things, they're flat.  And you've got to take them and roll them through a roller to curl them.  And then you stand by a stapler, this huge Bosch stapler that we work with, your foot, 
[00:34:30]  and all day staple these round tubes together.  Oh, man.  Your mind does not have to be there.  It doesn't even have to be there.  You know, it's purely a part of your brain that is like breathing or a heartbeat or something.  There's no way to staple your hand.  There's no way to do nothing wrong with you.  No, you really have to work at it to screw yourself up, because the space that the metal  goes in is very thin.  And the thing loads up with like a day's worth of staples.  You don't even have to change staples. 
[00:35:00]  And you've got a pile of this crap next to you, and you know what your entire day is  going to be.  So I would stand there and just do exactly what you would do.  I would daydream.  And mine was that some alien race came down to Earth and gave me all this really cool  alien technology, because there was this war going on.  And these other aliens were going to take over the Earth.  Right.  But these other aliens couldn't get involved with the aliens that were going to take over 
[00:35:30]  the Earth, because they didn't want to war with them.  Like Russians.  They gave us all this.  It was a Cold War.  Right.  Cold War.  Right.  Okay.  Exactly.  So they gave me all this good, like, space crap.  Like the Koreans.  And I got my buddies, and we would, like, go up in our spaceships and, you know, kick  some alien ants.  And there I am.  Cha-cook, cha-cook, cha-chook.  Cha-chook.  Stapling.  But I'm saving the Earth at the same time.  I'm in my spaceship. 
[00:36:00]  Anthony Rogers in the 21st and a half century.  Click, click.  Stapling away metal.  You know, you got to do what you got to do to get through the day, bro.  And I think a girl would shoot us over the head if she really knew what was going on in our heads.  If she had to do that.  Like, everything that they do is based on, like, actually having something tangible to do.  Dude, eight hours.  Four hours.  I was humongous, the non-talking football player, that the NFL had to figure out what to do with me because everyone would get hurt. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  So they got to change the rules because they're that damn good.  I was not only good, like, any time I hit you.  Yeah.  A stretcher had to come out.  The helmet and the shoes would fly off.  And they announced, ladies and gentlemen, you humongous, it's another one.  Like, just flashes going off in the stands.  And then one game I was playing a team, and I was the captain. 
[00:37:00]  I would just go out.  And they had a bunch of guys, and this guy was psyching himself up, really like, yeah, you think we're scared of you, humongous?  And he slapped me in the face and spit on me.  And I looked back at the team, and his team was like, oh, my God.  And my team was like, oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Oh, you messed up.  Oh, you didn't.  Thank God you're on our side.  Not humongous.  Oh, you just slapped me in the face.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Hey, Bert from Philly on the instant feedback.  Anthony and Space Hitler building the Fourth Reich. 
[00:37:30]  Like, and you had so much time that you'd have to get every detail in your head right.  Like, every, the smallest detail had to actually have some type of realism to it.  No matter how weird these fantasies were, this, this was back probably 10, 12, 13 years ago.  That's exactly what it was.  Oh, it had to be all the details.  Like, like, everybody couldn't be on to it.  That's Buck Rogers. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  Aunt Rogers, baby.  Like, I had to keep all this secret.  You know, I couldn't tell everybody.  You know, so everything was in my.  You said you had.  Yeah.  You said you had.  Just my closest buddies.  It was you and, like, about three dudes.  Yeah, five, eight, you know, just people I knew, like, buddies that I could trust.  And that's all you needed for the mission.  But everyone else, you know, it had to be a secret.  So I'd have to go about my daily business.  But, you know, when the crap would hit the fan, we'd have to hit some secret tunnels and get to the ships and, you know, launch and kick some ass. 
[00:38:30]  And you play this out in your mind.  All afternoon, lol.  He had to, but this is a 10-year-old daydream.  This would go for hours and hours on end in my head as I just chikung, chikung, staple.  Chikung, chikung.  And I'd be annoyed, like, when lunchtime would come around and I'd have to stop stapling and talk to people because I'm like, dude, I'm kicking aliens.  Wait a minute.  What do the aliens look like?  You already know what they look like. 
[00:39:00]  They look like your typical kind of hack aliens.  They're like your typical.  The long, big-eyed dudes.  They call them the grays, you know, with the big eyes and stuff.  The close encounters face?  Yeah, that kind of stuff.  And they had some kick-ass, you know, equipment.  And they would, like, hide, you know, on the other side of the moon and stuff like that.  And, you know, I got to go zip out and kick ass and come back in time for dinner.  Wait, who were you in your daydream?  Did you become better than you were?  I was a Timknocker.  No.  By day, I still had to go to work. 
[00:39:30]  I had to keep my cover.  It looks like you had, like, a Superman thing going on.  Yeah, I had to keep my cover.  You were kind of like a Clark Kent, uh, Timknocker type dude.  Not only was there a spaceship.  But if you exposed the aliens.  Yeah.  I mean, if you exposed, why didn't you expose this to planet Earth?  That would destroy our whole way of life.  And how did you build?  And how did you build?  Where did you get the materials for the laser beams and everything else?  I don't.  The aliens, the Cold War aliens that were against the aliens that were attacking Earth, they gave me all this stuff. 
[00:40:00]  They built all these underground bases.  I'd have to.  See, eat the details.  Oh, yeah.  Underground bases that were, like, deep below the Earth and take elevators.  Wait a minute.  So when you was thinking, right, so when you're doing the stapling, right, you're, like, in your head rationalizing how to make this logical.  Like, okay, where would I?  So you were saying, so where would I hide the ship?  Yeah.  He goes, ah, underground. 
[00:40:30]  Underground.  But they built the underground thing for you.  Oh, they did everything for us.  They're the coolest guys, those aliens.  And they built everything.  And they told you we can't get involved.  Yeah, we can't get involved.  Why couldn't they get involved again?  Because then it would make war between the two, you know, and they didn't want that.  It was like, it was Cold War.  It was Cold War.  That's what we did with the Russians for a long time.  Korea, Vietnam, all that kind of stuff.  Is that what it was based on, that ideology?  I guess so, yeah, in a way.  It was based more on.  It was based more on. 
[00:41:00]  I was a tin knocker.  Jesus, I'm just a humongous.  Hitting people in football.  You're trying to save the universe.  It was based more on I was a tin knocker with absolutely no future who wanted to be a guy that saved the world.  Ant Vader.  That's right.  That's amazing.  Oh, man.  Hey, we're going to get back to the internet.  I haven't thought of that in years, though.  That's very funny.  You bring up humongous.  We're going to get back to the internet search list here after the break.  So, so far, we've got fag. 
[00:41:30]  How old are you, 10?  You've got to get your imagination rolling.  Come on.  Ant has an unbelievable imagination.  We know that by now.  Top 10 searches.  So, so far in 10th place, we've got Christmas, and we only got to nine Nintendo Wii.  It's the Blu-ray technology that's screwing up the profitability of the PSA.  No one knows which way it's going to go yet.  Yeah.  Sony's got the Blu-ray.  But that's, you know, that came in a million times, and that is correct. 
[00:42:00]  That is why that's, it's going to be tough to make a profit anytime soon.  By the way, I can't upgrade PalTalk because I need an administrator permission.  Which, these computers are, you know, come on.  I flew spaceships against alien races.  I can't get into this computer.  Where they at?  Maybe they can help.  Maybe that password's underground.  Oh, Cold War aliens, please come down and help me log in so I can run PalTalk.  That's hilarious.  So I can see boobies. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I got a headache laughing at how detailed that is.  You should make up your own video game, man.  Oh.  You really should.  I already thought about it.  But that's the imagination of yours.  All right.  Yeah.  God, we got so much today.  We got to get into some Tyra.  We got to get into the DJ that got shot from Power 105.  And he's not dead.  Well.  Wow.  He took, like, 13 shots.  They're saying gravely ill.  He gets shot 13 times.  I don't care if it's in, like, each finger. 
[00:43:00]  And the palms of your hand and maybe a foot.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  You're in serious condition.  That's crazy, man.  We'll get into that because Dan and I just don't understand something.  Maybe you can explain it to the white man because that's why we'll never get along.  You guys do things that we have no concept of and probably vice versa, I'm sure.  Yeah, I'll tell you what.  And they just want everyone to get along out there.  It's just never going to happen on a mass level because we think so differently.  Yes, we do.  The black man thinks so differently than the white man who thinks differently than the 
[00:43:30]  Asian man who thinks differently than the Latino man.  Not really.  I mean, there's some general things we all overlap.  There's a war going on between how black people think and how white people think.  And everyone else is picking sides on which one to think like.  And no one else thinks like anybody else.  Well, you won the war over music.  I'll tell you that much.  That's right.  Asians and Indians want to be white people.  Yeah.  They want to oppress and they're not good at it. 
[00:44:00]  You guys won the war.  It's docile.  You won the war over music.  I mean, in New York City, we do not have an alternative rock station.  Why should we?  Well, because the alternative rock used to be huge.  Rock in general used to be huge.  Like Free Bird and all that stuff.  But now, like the hot music for the 18 and 34 year old males out there is the good old  hip hop.  To dress hip hop.  To listen to hip hop.  Because it's a music that you can actually, you can do something to in terms of dance. 
[00:44:30]  You can't really, like I love the song.  Stop thinking too deeply into it.  It's a trend that is happening.  It's all going to hip hop for now.  A trend?  A 25 year old trend?  A trend is a fad.  All right.  We'll get into it after the break.  This is what I'm talking about.  To me, yes, it's a trend because it's just starting to happen the last five years or so.  You're talking 25 years.  I'm talking about, you know, as a white male in America.  As a white male in America, it's all about hip hop now. 
[00:45:00]  I'm going to tell you something about hip hop, why it's still around.  After we come back, I'm going to tell you it's not around because it's great.  I'm going to tell you why it's around.  But see, that's why we think differently.  You're saying 25 years.  Yeah, 25 years.  In my world, hip hop has been around for five years.  As far as the, as far as.  And you know what?  In that five years, if it was up to white people, hip hop would be, would be dead right now.  And I'm going to, I'll tell you why.  All right, we'll get into it.  I'll tell you why.  And I know people are going to go, are you nuts, hip hop, five years? 
[00:45:30]  I know it goes all the way back.  But as far as.  I know what you're saying.  As far as the white male goes, it's, it's the last about five years where it's just completely taken over.  To the point where there's not an alternative rock station here in New York City, which, in my world, seems beyond crazy.  It shouldn't be.  All right, we'll get into it.  Who does alternative rock anyway anymore?  And what's an alternative to?  Honestly, honestly, there's not a lot of great bands out there these days, but, you know, as far as the rock bands.  But, but I don't know.  I don't know.  We'll get into that.  We'll get into the, the internet search list.  Because there's some really, really good things on here. 
[00:46:00]  A lot of hot pieces of asses are being searched.  And as I want to, I know about why a couple of them, but I'm, you know.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jimmy Norton.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree.  Only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  What?  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents. 
[00:46:30]  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden funds is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Bye.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Show.  Yeah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're looking at the trailer for this new movie, 300, that's coming out soon. 
[00:47:00]  And Patrice is losing his mind.  Anthony's losing his mind.  Sodom Fark this morning.  That could be the best trailer I've ever seen.  It's amazing.  Sodom Fark it said, you know, best trailer you're going to see.  It's amazing.  Clicked on it and was like, watched it five times already, the trailer.  It just looks really cool.  It's the guy that did Sin City.  Frank Miller.  He wrote it.  Yeah.  Look, he didn't write it.  He wrote it.  He wrote it?  I know he directed it.  Dude, if this movie is bad, I won't go to movies anymore. 
[00:47:30]  I'm telling you right now.  You'll retire?  Never go to another movie.  Because the trailer looks so damn good that if the movie is bad, I'll be pissed.  I have to see it right now.  Yeah.  I have to see it right now.  Where's the print?  When's the movie coming out?  Yeah, when is it coming out?  November of 2018.  Actually, March 9th, 2007.  All right.  We got, what, four months?  Yeah.  Oh, it has beautiful women that it's magical and it's real. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  When you were saying it was Spartan, I was like, oh, some Spartan thing 300.  I'm like, oh, yippee.  But it's like ogres.  But yeah, there's some of that weird kind of, yeah, ogre.  It's like Sinbaddy.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness, dude.  But then there's these Spartans, 300 Spartans that are doing some ass-kicking battle.  A giant rhino?  Battle rhinos.  Battle rhino.  Look at this, dude.  This is exciting.  Some great battle sequences.  Hey, can I ask you?  It just looks fantastic. 
[00:48:30]  Can I ask the obvious question?  What is the movie about 300?  Who even cares?  A bunch of Spartans.  I think it's 300 Spartans against, like, a million just ass-kickers.  Against the aliens, Ant.  Well, no.  That's my gig.  Don't hone in on my gig.  I'm saving the world in space.  I thought maybe they stole your idea.  They twisted a little bit and made a different type of movie here.  Directed by Zack Snyder, who directed Dawn of the Dead.  Okay.  All right. 
[00:49:00]  What's Dawn of the Dead?  The last one with Ving.  2004.  2004 version?  The 2000.  I like the one with Ving.  That wasn't bad.  That was a good one.  But still.  That just looks great.  Why don't we move on?  Where can we see this trailer?  Fark.com, you said it?  Yeah, Fark's got it up there.  It's called 300.  300.  I'm sure if you go to Apple.com also, they got a whole trailer section.  You see it in high def, full screen.  All right.  We got to talk about hip-hop.  We got to get back to this internet search list.  Y'all should have never showed me 300. 
[00:49:30]  Now you just want to go right now.  I don't want to know about hip-hop at all.  I don't want to know about it.  Get me that movie.  You just want to talk movies now, right?  I need the 300.  I need 300 in my life right now.  I got to have it.  I kind of said to Patrice during the break that, you know, you're kind of a geek.  You don't like to lead on that you're kind of geeky.  No, I'm very – my childhood or growing up, I'm very hood, but I'm just – I'm very –  You're hood geek.  I guess – 
[00:50:00]  There it is.  Like, when you're in the hood, are you allowed to show your geekness or is that a sign of weakness?  Like, I don't know.  You can now.  That's the resentment you have because you can now when you – after you get close to being 40 and, you know, you just pay a pressure, you know, when you do things.  But I love everything that just – that I like.  Like, I have a visceral reaction to things, and I don't let it stop me from enjoying it anymore.  I don't – you know, it's like the Kramer thing.  Like, you ask me.  It's like, I tell you exactly what I feel.  Right.  I'm not going to figure out a way to not tell you how I feel, you know? 
[00:50:30]  So, I'm very into a lot of stuff, man.  Yeah.  And I'm not ashamed.  I like knowledge.  I like to know.  Pop culture is my strength.  I just like a lot about a lot of things, dude.  Useless things and just –  Yeah.  That's fun stuff.  So, when I see something like this, man, it just – you know, I just get mad and happy to say I just wish I could have been a part – like, I'm in show business.  Why didn't I know this existed?  Yeah, how did you not know until right now? 
[00:51:00]  Someone's making maybe the greatest movie I've ever seen?  It kind of just hit the internet, though.  I mean, if it's on FARC, FARC is usually on top of things.  I'm sure Roland will offer us the gaffer on the movie.  Oh, where's Roland?  No kidding.  Where's Roland?  He'll offer us best boy or one of the lighting techs.  Dude.  No kidding.  We've got to do movie reviews with Roland today because you've got the Mel Gibson movie coming out and a couple other –  Apocalypto.  A couple other just – they just look like bombs.  Abominable movie.  Hey, so, hip-hop.  Yeah.  Been around for 25 years. 
[00:51:30]  Yes.  As far as the white man goes in general, because we talk in general terms here, I say four or five years.  Four or five years.  I know what you're saying.  To the point where now there's no alternative rock station in New York.  And someone on Instant Feedback said, well, the reason for that is because all the white boys are buying iPods.  Ah.  What does that mean?  They're buying the iPods and they're programming their own freaking radio stations.  The iPods.  Music's got to come from somewhere, though, right?  I don't think that's affecting – I mean, white people always try to figure out a way why they're ahead of black folks, but no. 
[00:52:00]  Nobody – grassroots stuff never dies.  You know what I'm saying?  That's like saying no one listens to talk radio because blah, blah, blah.  It's like why aren't you guys dead?  Alternative Rock is dead, but you guys ain't dead.  Yeah.  White people can do this magical pod stuff.  Forget about it.  Well, we keep reinventing ourselves.  You got to kind of –  You don't.  Yeah, we do.  White people – this is what white people do.  We keep – as far as a talk show we do, as the white man, we don't reinvent ourselves?  No, white people don't reinvent ourselves. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  But as a talk show, we certainly do.  You talking about you guys – yes.  In general, I'm not arguing with that.  If you keep doing the same radio show day after day, eventually it's going to catch up with you  and you're going to be pushed out the door.  I thought you were just talking culturally.  I was about to say, get over yourself.  But in terms of the show –  I get it.  We steal from the black man.  I don't know.  You guys come up with all the good stuff and then we take it from you.  Well, I mean, look, hip-hop –  I know.  Hip-hop would be destroyed.  I'm going to tell you something.  The only reason hip-hop – because if you notice, hip-hop really – there's five elements 
[00:53:00]  or four elements.  One, graffiti, breakdancing, DJing, and rap.  Right.  Three of those is almost – you don't really see anybody breakdancing anymore.  Extinct.  And graffiti not anymore.  DJing is not what it used to be.  You don't see guys – rappers don't have a DJ like they used to.  No.  Rap was on his way out too, but the only thing that keeps rap going – and no offense to the guy.  He's a big star, but say like a Will Smith, right? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  When Will Smith makes music where white people think that they know black people now,  like when he makes music, he goes, getting jiggy with it, you know?  Yeah.  And it's like some of the white people go, oh, we don't need black folks no more because  we now know it.  So we don't need to have you around.  So we're going to take it and we're going to commercialize it and we're going to destroy  it because now we like it.  But that's why people – as long as young black angry kids are growing up, man, and that's 
[00:54:00]  the only way you'll destroy hip-hop is if young black kids become happy and we tap  into our happy part.  But as long as –  And there is a happy part.  You guys just –  There is a happy part.  You guys just ignore that.  As long as there's anger and there's – as long as there's somebody where a white person  goes, I don't understand.  As long as there's a kid that's angrier than white people's understanding where you go,  yeah, jiggy, I get it.  Yeah, and then some kid just, you know, some new violence they invent. 
[00:54:30]  New violence.  This new anger.  And that's why rap still lives because there's constantly some kid who's just under the gutter  who just is hungry and angry and that's the way – so I'm going to tell you, rap would  have been gone.  But five years ago when you heard it is because getting jiggy with it.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  That works both – but that works both ways.  I can't touch this.  That crosses – that crosses racial boundaries too because –  Yeah, you're kind of insulting the white man with the Will Smith thing.  I mean, we understand – we understand that is completely commercialized hip-hop. 
[00:55:00]  Not stupid.  So what about, you know, R.D. or Young Jeezy?  You know Young Jeezy is?  No, I – exactly.  But to use Will Smith as ambles to me, I mean –  Only I use Memphis is the song.  You're so intelligent if I say we love rap by – uh, the Donald Carter.  We're hip-hopping through the commercial.  Okay, five years ago.  I'm talking like Eminem and stuff at least.  That's a – that's a little better than Will Smith.  Eminem, you know – you don't know his music.  You just know he's a white guy who has – who has respect in the – in the hip-hop world.  No, I bought – I bought a few of his earlier CDs, absolutely. 
[00:55:30]  You can't say one of his lines.  Besides, um, uh, I'm the – some shady as I'm – he has some real ghetto stuff.  He has some angry stuff.  Well, the rest of his albums are great.  He threw those out there as – as the – as the, uh, commercial for what he's, uh – he's all about, to get people hooked.  But what –  He even hates those songs.  I get it.  Exactly.  I understand that.  Those are songs you know.  No, I –  But Patrice, what you described is exactly what happens in any music, in rock music, like, uh, when all those hair bands were – were popular. 
[00:56:00]  And all you saw were the guys with the bleached blonde, long hair, looking like chicks on stage, and in a garage somewhere, you know, that no one knew about, uh, when everyone thought they knew what rock was, uh, was some guy playing some, you know –  Nirvana.  Nirvana.  Now.  Yeah.  Here's – here's what I'm talking about in terms of culturally.  Culturally.  Mm-hmm.  Don't be insulted.  Now, when I said what I said because to you – okay, now, I was talking, um, over at VH1 one day. 
[00:56:30]  I was like, hey, one of the best guitarists, man, to a white guy.  One of the best guitarists is, uh, the one – and I'm only talking from what I know –  Right.  Is the Eagles, man, Hotel California.  I love that guitar.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  And as a white guy who knows knows, he's like, I will stab you in your face if you say something I don't know about something.  Now, trust me.  There's some white people out there.  You might be a little hipper. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not saying I'm hipper.  I'm just defending, you know, pretty much my – pretty much the white man.  But the Will Smith thing is ridiculous.  It's not ridiculous because –  That's pop crap.  Because I used to – you know, if you –  That's bubblegum pop, they call it.  Rock.  Do-do-do-do.  I'm sitting there going, okay, I know that.  I want to rock.  Yeah.  And that is cheeseball to y'all.  Right.  But I didn't know it was cheeseball to, you know, um – my boy – until Kurt Cobain comes out and smashed it in the head. 
[00:57:30]  And I go, wait a minute, this stuff that I knew as rock and roll, there's white boys because I wasn't talking to white boys at the time for them to tell me what the real stuff is.  Yeah.  I'm into the stuff that y'all hate.  So, of course, there's some white people out there that hip-hop to them was getting jiggy with it.  Getting jiggy with it.  It was.  Yeah.  But meanwhile, there's some angry guy somewhere, you know, doing his own thing and making new rhymes and new – like you said, making up new violence. 
[00:58:00]  New violence.  Like 50, what 50 did was take authentic, authentic street.  Like authentic – like he was validated as a gangster.  Got shot nine times.  Right.  He sat in the third.  Black people validated 50, and he got so famous that white people – like so it gave that – but now that thug thing is getting old.  And then you got guys like Jeezy who lyrically ain't – he ain't, you know, these – on the top level, but it's something about him that's real grimy. 
[00:58:30]  Jeezy.  Young Jeezy.  Young Jeezy.  No clue.  Exactly.  No clue.  He just says things.  I'm not playing around with you.  I don't know the young Jeezy.  Exactly, dude.  All right.  Here's the question I have for you.  So now that – now that the white man and – well, white in general has discovered hip-hop to the point where it's probably the number one music with like, you know, kids 18 to 34. 
[00:59:00]  Not – you can't go as high as 34.  But whatever.  The youth of America is now really, really into hip-hop.  What is the black community going to do next?  Are they going to come up with something different?  I told you what they do.  Or they're going to go deeper?  Because these white kids seem like they're really educated about the hip-hop.  It's – they're not – because they may be educated about hip-hop, but they're not educated about where it's coming from.  Like, they can't – you can't really – you have to kind of breathe it and be there and live it for it to mean something. 
[00:59:30]  But they feel like they're living it.  They're not.  They feel like they are.  There's some white boys out there that are very tough and very –  They're dressing hip-hop now and they're talking hip-hop and they're feeling like they're living it themselves.  Just like Elvis.  He took what he liked from the blues and then made it his thing and made it accessible to white people.  White people take what they need.  And then that's it.  Always have. 
[01:00:00]  You are cultural looters.  Leave the rest.  Burn the rest.  Pillage.  You have the flat-screen TVs of everyone's culture floating down a riverbank.  I love it.  It's a scorched-earth policy we have.  Take what we need and just leave a swath of destruction behind.  I love it.  Just come on out and do your thing.  But I'm telling you, if you don't know – I mean, there's some white guys.  Again, I'm generalizing because Eminem is really like a redneck kid, but he just – 
[01:00:30]  He got accepted by the – he got accepted by the white community, though.  Because he could really rap.  Because he was really good.  Not many white rappers getting accepted by the white community.  I can't think of another one.  Bubba Sparks got accepted.  Paul Wall is accepted.  Paul Wall, a southern guy.  I couldn't tell you.  Vanilla Ice was.  Not for 10 minutes.  For 10 seconds.  Before Suge got a hold of him and hung him over a balcony and said, hey up.  Hey up, white boy.  That's how you know Eminem probably is legitimate because no one's really hanging Eminem. 
[01:01:00]  Or a balcony.  No, it's sad.  The top 10 songs in America.  I'm looking at the list.  And I like to think I'm hip when it comes to music.  I've been doing this freaking DJ thing for a while now.  We Fly High by Jim Jones, No Clue.  Shorty Like Mine, Bow Wow featuring Chris Brown and Jonta Austin, No Clue.  These are the hottest songs in America.  Lips of an Angel by Hinder, No Clue. 
[01:01:30]  How to Save a Life by The Fray.  I've heard that song.  Wait, isn't Hot 100 something like different?  This is like pop songs.  Different than?  No, these are the pop songs, eh?  And even the pop songs.  This is pop songs.  Wow.  Winded Up by Gwen Stefani.  I heard that on the Billboard Music Awards.  My Love by Justin Timberlake featuring T.I.  That's a black song.  I haven't heard that.  Fergalicious.  Unfortunately, I've heard that by Fergie.  And that's a complete rip-off from Supersonic from J.J. Fad.  Who?  Exactly. 
[01:02:00]  Get me a little rascal.  Get me a little rascal scooter.  Exactly.  Smack That by Akon featuring Eminem.  But this goes to show you're not reaching out.  You're not reaching out.  I want to love you.  Akon featuring Snoop Dogg.  And then Beyonce with Irreplaceable.  You're not reaching out?  I got to change some of my presets.  No kidding, man.  And the reason, and I will say this.  Growing up, when I was a teenager, I knew a lot about white music because they used to 
[01:02:30]  play it.  Where do you go to find white music?  It's gone.  Yeah.  It's like, I don't know what station it's on.  Like, you know, because MTV used to play, like, yo, MTV raps.  I got all the raps.  And then I would see what white guys was out there.  We could talk for New York.  New York, you're not going to find it on the radio.  They're finding their white music on their iPods because they're downloading the stuff  themselves.  And of course, you know, you got the satellite radio that's taking care of that as well.  I downloaded Rod Stewart's That's What Friends Are For, because I think it's a better version 
[01:03:00]  than the...  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a better version.  Maybe you shouldn't have admitted to that.  I don't care.  That's what friends are for.  There's a lot of different versions, and I like Rod's.  What are you going to do?  Call me whatever you want.  I guess so.  Oh, well.  Anything?  Well, whatever.  Besides what you call me.  All right, Micah Richards.  No, I see.  That's what you get.  That's your mind at work.  I wasn't going to say that.  White people don't know nothing until it's brought to you on a silver platter. 
[01:03:30]  Why?  A culture.  Hmm.  Let me taste this.  All right.  Bring that to me.  Bring that culture to me.  Bring this culture.  What is this?  Beatboxing?  Before me.  Oh, please.  So you like the Eagles, huh?  I enjoyed it.  And the dude, and the dude, and I said, I like that guitar riff.  And the guy goes, I try to learn.  Like, there's this guy.  Oh, man.  Dennis Leary, the drum.  I'm sorry.  Adam Roth.  You know Adam Roth?  Well, Adam Roth is a well-respected guitarist.  He's, you know, and he's down with Dennis Leary. 
[01:04:00]  And I was just talking to him about who's who and who's what.  And I'm like, all right, Rush.  Rush does a song.  Because I remember, I'll tell you where most of my rock, alternative rock knowledge came from.  Wrestling.  Because that's when they used to have old school wrestling.  That used to be, they didn't have original wrestling music.  Iron Man, Roll Wars used to come out too.  Yeah.  Freebirds.  The Freebirds used to, if I see the lead here. 
[01:04:30]  Rush, modern day, Tom Sawyer.  Kerry Von Erick used to come out to Tom Sawyer.  And I'm like, yeah.  And I knew it from that.  So I started trying to reach out a little bit.  That's hysterical.  I'm just serious, man.  So, you know, a lot of the guys came out to the old school.  It used to be songs they used to come out to and not, like, produced.  Yeah.  You know, this is your music.  Original music just for them, right?  So I knew a lot about it from that, man.  So it's like, you know.  Phone's lit.  Oh, man.  Dave in Jersey. 
[01:05:00]  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Good morning.  What's up?  Hey, Opie.  I agree with you, man.  Keep the faith.  Let's keep it real.  Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana.  Black Hole, son.  Won't you come.  Well, I got it.  And wash away the rain.  Those songs are all 10 years old now.  But that's when they used to play white guy music.  But now there's a resurgence.  Now, did you see the MTV Awards?  Wait, were you making fun of that, by the way?  No, it's a great song.  Chris Cornell, one of the greatest voices in rock history.  That was a great song, dude. 
[01:05:30]  How do you think I know it?  How do you think I make fun of a song that I know?  So what happened is, white people making a comeback in terms of that.  Because if you saw the MTV Awards this past, they were rising up against hip-hop.  Why are they?  Because, yeah, for the past few years, it's just been hip-hop.  Some old-school legend dude that might have been Rock Petty or something, he got up and  he goes, hey, listen, thank you, everybody.  And, hey, listen, man, keep playing that rock and roll all night long. 
[01:06:00]  It was just these unknown, known rock and roll dudes who are sort of famous, but not famous  because hip-hop took over, and now they got this new super anger, and they ready to pop.  You know what I mean?  So it has been 10 years, but it should have been 10 years.  You know why?  Because I knew Soundgarden.  So if I know Soundgarden, that means it ain't, it need to take a break.  Hip-hop will probably take a break.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, that's not a bad thought.  It brings up a good point.  I'm just saying, I know Black Hole, so I shouldn't. 
[01:06:30]  When you say Soundgarden, that should be for white people.  Look.  Soundgarden.  When I say Young Jeezy, it should be just for black folks.  And it is.  You know what's funny?  When Grunge hit, I thought it would last forever because it was so different, and you know what  I mean?  So good.  Yeah, but then you had to look at the hair bands as an example.  I mean, at the end of the hair band run, you knew it was just a matter of time that the  House of Cards or whatever was going to just completely collapse.  Everyone knew.  You know, you start seeing it on commercials for Campbell's Soup. 
[01:07:00]  Right, right, right.  You know, whenever they start using the music for commercials, it's over.  Yeah, it just gets watered down to the point, you know, it's just sitting there waiting  to be taken over by something new.  I said the Eagles.  I go, man, the guitar riff at the end of the Eagles, man.  Hotel California, right, dude?  And it's like, what?  I'll have you killed.  First of all, it's 30 years old.  Second of all, who doesn't know that riff is great?  It's just one of those. 
[01:07:30]  Certainly, there's five guitars doing it at the same time.  That's why it sounds so cool.  Not only five guitars.  Every guitarist has two necks.  Yeah.  So it's kind of like 10 guitars.  No, I mean, it's one of those timeless pieces, you know?  Yeah, man, it's like it's time.  I mean, Nirvana, I mean, Kurt did his thing, and then it was a couple of Kurt Cobain guys  type of, I'm going to be dirty on purpose.  Right, right.  And then now it's...  You know what, though?  Amazingly, because I'm a huge Nirvana fan, there wasn't a lot of copycat Nirvana bands 
[01:08:00]  that happened during when Kurt was alive and after Kurt was alive.  Couldn't pull that off, but the whole grunge thing.  There were a few.  A lot of bad grunge.  A little mud, you know, they say is a Nirvana ripoff.  But in general, I thought the music market would be just flooded with Nirvana sounding  like bands.  And there were a few, but not as many as I thought.  Why try to hit that mark when you could, you know, do subpar and still make it in that  whole grunge time? 
[01:08:30]  Because that's what happened.  A lot of bad bands came out.  What's your music now, though?  Now there really isn't a...  It's emo.  A lot of whining guys.  It's whining emo guys.  Oh, baby.  That's what it is.  Love is a wah-hoo.  A lot of crying.  A lot of white boys are crying.  Oh, they're just crying their eyes out.  I'm not too happy with it.  It is just the wimpiest...  I'm not too happy with the white rock music team.  Wussy music.  You're right.  I'm not too happy with all the makeup coming back.  Here I walk up this morning. 
[01:09:00]  Ha-hoo, ha-hoo.  And a guy in the video, he's always walking slow and everybody's moving fast and he's like  bop-a-boo.  Bop-a-boo.  It's short hair and makeup.  Oh, God damn.  What's that guy's name?  If you're going to wear the makeup, you might as well grow the hair out because...  Oh, James?  James Blunt?  James Blunt.  What's the song?  Well, Coldplay's got a song.  We're walking through the walls.  That love...  What's the...  It's so famous.  By my lover! 
[01:09:30]  No, just...  That's the other one.  You're beautiful.  You're beautiful.  We were just talking about this with Jimmy.  Ant and I were talking in the office.  We were talking about James Blunt and Norton gets...  Norton gets angry on such a level.  Like, we were talking about James Blunt.  He was so angry, like, 9-11 happened again.  I'm like, dude, it's just James Blunt, man.  Because that is representative of white music now.  That's what I know.  So if I know that, then that means that you're in deep trouble.  We're a bit wimpy these days.  Yeah, beautiful. 
[01:10:00]  You got James Blunt, you got Coldplay, you got Snow Patrol all taking over the world with  their emotions.  Yeah, my Chemical Romance is on the cover of Blender this month.  It's called Emo.  It's Emo.  Well, they're wearing a lot of makeup.  A lot of makeup.  But, yeah, they're all right.  They're all right.  You're beautiful.  That's true.  That's so funny. 
[01:10:30]  They're moving in slow motion.  Everyone's moving fast around them.  I just can't keep up, man.  I can't keep up with the world, man.  Everything's going so fast, and I just want to live my life back.  I just want to slow down a bit and think about myself and my emotions, man.  Just cry a little bit.  It was all yellow.  What?  The whole world is moving past me, man.  It's so fast.  And look how they were kind of in black and white, and I'm the only one in color.  No one's paying attention to anyone else. 
[01:11:00]  The beach tide is going in and out real fast.  Yeah, it's the light.  It's light as dark.  It's light as dark.  Because no one understands me, man.  I got to slow down a little bit.  Shut up.  From this hectic world.  It was all yellow.  What?  Oh, do I want to reach in and smack him in the head.  I like that.  Get a job.  It was all beautiful.  Beautiful.  All the same song.  It was all yellow.  Oh, is that funny?  White people finished.  Y'all will be back in another five years. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, man.  We'll be back.  It's tough to argue that point today.  We are a little wimpy, but we'll figure it out there, Patrice.  I mean, your music and white guilt, I will be leading soon.  I will be your leader.  That's stupid white guilt.  We did a whole show on that yesterday.  White guilt and beautiful will be the downfall of white people.  That downfall of whitey.  That's stupid white guilt.  You're so right, man.  Uh-huh.  All right.  We got to do something.  I don't know.  We got too much to do.  I don't know. 
[01:12:00]  All right.  We got to do the internet search list because there's some interesting ones on there.  Here, got off on a music tangent.  Tyra.  Oh, God.  John Lennon.  How many years ago today was it?  Do the math.  20, 26 maybe?  20 years ago today.  No, that was so different.  Today?  No, it was 20.  It was 1980, right?  The big anniversary was last year.  26 years ago today, John Lennon was shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  So the rock station here in New York. 
[01:12:30]  Wow.  This is just terrific.  The headline is, imagine there's a day of John Lennon's music.  Oh, I see.  They got to fit in.  Q104 here in New York City.  We'll give them a plug.  We'll mark the anniversary of John Lennon's death today with a heavy dose of his solo and Beatles music.  Maria Melito will feature Lennon on her noontime workforce block.  Oh.  You're so not important.  All the jocks over there should do an ultimate tribute and just go out like him.  If the paper has to write that you're doing a workforce block, that's the best they can come up with after they say your name, you're just not important in this business. 
[01:13:00]  Sorry, state.  Wow.  You mean you're going to play three Lennon songs in a row today?  Wow.  Wow.  Setting the radio world on fire.  Poor people.  Unbelievable.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:13:30]  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtime.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, good morning.  Hope you're enjoying the festivities today.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in for Jim Norton.  Jimmy's out in L.A. getting ready for the porn awards. 
[01:14:00]  Can I tell them I'm going to be this weekend?  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead, Patrice.  I'm going to be at Caroline's The Late Shows tonight, tomorrow, and Sunday.  So, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, one show, late show.  12.30 Friday, 12.30 Saturday, and like 10 o'clock Sunday.  I might bring Brother Weez and the gang down there tonight.  It's late.  It's late for me.  Even on Fridays, if I nap, though, maybe.  I'm a wimp. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, my fans come out late, you know.  All right.  Hey, we want to move on, but Angela has something to say about pop culture and music and all that.  Go ahead, Angela.  Hey.  Hey.  I'm 20 years old.  My father grew up with Janice Joplin and ACDC.  I'm growing up with my chemical romance and the peppers.  I feel raped out of good music for my age, and it's not fair.  I'm jealous.  Well, why don't you just download that music?  Make your own music.  I mean, Martha, you know, when you guys grew up, you had new music coming out, and it was good music. 
[01:15:00]  Now, if you want something new and different, it doesn't exist.  See, all right, yeah, this is where I got to stop you, because I read in a book once, but it made it all make sense to me.  Every generation, it was a simple quote.  It said, every generation wants to be the last generation.  It doesn't really help, because Angela is part of the new generation.  I thought Angela was going to be older.  Older people in general go, ah, the movies were better when I was younger, the music was better when I was younger, TV was better when I was younger. 
[01:15:30]  Think about what movie...  Yeah, but if you get a kid on the line, he would argue, no, today's music is better.  No, well, he can't.  Okay.  All I'm saying is, you know, yeah, to me it was better, but you can't say overall that our generation had the best stuff.  You just can't say it.  You ever see the movie Deep Blue Sea with Sam Jackson?  No.  Yeah.  All right, there was Deep Blue Sea, and then there was Jaws.  There was Night of the Living, whatever, whatever, and there was The Exorcist. 
[01:16:00]  The Exorcist was in 1973, and anyone who sees The Exorcist, like my girl, never seen this, we watched it together, and they have a scene that they cut out The Exorcist that's the weirdest scene ever in the history of a movie, and they cut it out the movie because it disturbed people so much.  It's called The Spider Walk, which came down backwards, and then blood came out of her mouth on her face, and it was shocking.  You understand what I'm saying? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, that was some scary stuff.  And it still is. It lives up to that.  So what I was going to say, though, during the time, the 70s, it was a creative time, though.  And do you see any artists? Do you see Picassos?  All right.  All those artists were all in the same area.  I could get some young people on the phone right now, and they could tell you they not only saw The Exorcist, they would give you an example of a movie that came out in the last couple of years that blows The Exorcist away.  Not at never.  In their world.  Ever. 
[01:17:00]  I'm telling you, that's just how it goes.  If it's in their world, Opie, then you should tell them it doesn't exist.  There's no movie that comes out that's scarier than The Exorcist that goes into your soul.  What, The Grudge?  Get out of here.  And the girl's crawling, and the little kid, which is now becoming corny.  Yeah.  Well, now it's becoming corny.  The little kid thing is corny.  All right, but when it first hit, it wasn't corny.  It was like, holy crap, they updated the horror movie.  Yeah, because The Ring was scary.  Because the little kid, that was Lyndon, it wasn't scary. 
[01:17:30]  Well, that was pretty scary, that black and white picture kind of moving in creepily.  Flash.  Yeah, flash.  That's scary.  But for what they did, you know what they did?  Linda Blair, to this day, can't walk straight.  Because they tore that little girl's back to shreds, and she was a soul, did not sue, busted  up her back, because they don't do that anymore.  Yeah.  That's why...  Wait, wait, wait, how does that story go again? 
[01:18:00]  She, all the convulsions and stuff that they were doing, messed her back up, all that flipping,  and people were getting pneumonia because the dude, William Freakin, would actually make  the place as cold as it had to be.  Yeah, so the steam would come out of their mouth.  It was no CGI, they CGI cold breath now.  Yeah.  So now you're actually in Hawaii on the beach with CGI cold breath, and okay, the ring comes  out, and it's like, oh, it's squiggly lines, and she's limping, and she comes out the TV, 
[01:18:30]  but in The Exorcist, man, it was real, and you felt it.  You know what she did?  That, that, that, that, that, that, it's like, oh, man, nothing is that scary, dude.  It's, it's, it's love in these movies, Jaws, they had to figure out how to make the shark  exist because it was broke, and what he made up was even better was the barrels.  Yeah, that is a great story.  Nobody does that now, man.  You were supposed to see that shark throughout the whole movie, and the damn mechanical shark 
[01:19:00]  broke down, and they're like, oh, well, we're out here, we got the crews, let's figure  something out.  Hopefully it'll work.  You're right.  It won't show it that much.  It's nothing great like that, you know?  But they didn't have that vision, like, it would be really scary if you didn't see the  shark.  They did it because they couldn't, they'd get the shark to work.  Fair enough, man.  But in the end, it, it, it, now they look brilliant for doing it that way.  Yep.  But the backstory is, you were supposed to see the shark to the whole movie.  Look at, I mean, look at, like, E.T., how, how better is E.T. than, than Waterworlds? 
[01:19:30]  Like, when, even.  Oh, my God, that's a dumb example.  No, no, I'm saying, and I, and I'm gonna tell you why.  E.T., Waterworld, hmm.  Did you see, did you see E.T. that, just, you could see it was a puppet.  You could see it was a little midget in there.  But it has some soul.  But, like, Waterworlds, what I'm saying is when the aliens came out, the things you can  do now almost makes movies bad.  I don't like CGI.  I mean, I, I, it's no, I just enjoy Clash of the Titans, man.  Just, just some dude.  And a claymation. 
[01:20:00]  All right, listen.  I just enjoy it.  You don't like CGI, but, eventually, you're gonna love CGI, because they're figuring that  out every day, too, in every movie.  Like, that 300 trailer we just saw.  Oh, Lord.  That was CGI'd up the, you know what.  And it looked a lot better than some of the CGI from only a year or two ago.  This sounds like I'm backpedaling, but I, I agree with you.  Because the computers are getting better, and the, you know.  But that has something to it.  Yep.  There are some CGI situations that it's love.  The CGI is, is love there. 
[01:20:30]  Like, then somebody sits there, and it's like, this is love.  Yep.  Like, um, uh, the dude from, uh, Lord of the Rings.  Right, right.  Gollum.  What they did to create Gollum.  You don't like the CGI in Lord of the Rings?  No, I was gonna say, that had some soul.  Right.  It did.  They used it.  The guy became a character.  You know.  You know what happens, though?  Like, when there's a new technology, probably, in, in filmmaking in general, it's like, oh,  wow, this is cool.  New technology, but you don't really think about it having a soul or a personality.  You know what I mean?  Right.  It's just cool to go, wow, we can make a, a million aliens and, and, and, and not hire all 
[01:21:00]  these actors.  We can just do it on a computer.  Cool.  But then what happens, the technology, people aren't impressed with the actual technology anymore,  and now you gotta give it, you gotta give it a life of its own.  And, and that's what I think is starting to happen with, like, that trailer 300.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all CGI, but like you said, it has soul, it has a life, it has personality.  Look what Star Wars did when they got a hold of CGI, like, this is what we can do with it,  and you go, oh, really?  You made Jabba the Hutt move.  Who cares?  Wow.  Right, right. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  But, but, if you're living.  Look, there's a bunch of ships out the window behind you.  Right.  Fantastic.  But if you're living back in that time, when that first hits, and you've seen it for the  first time, and they're little models, you didn't care, because you're like, wow, this  is so different, it's cool.  But you, you know, then you had to make, you had to make the models look better, you had  to give them, like, make them look more realistic, and, and, and, you know, it keeps moving forward.  I'm not disagreeing with you about what it is, I'm just saying, like, of course, like,  okay, this argument's almost like saying, you know, Pac-Man, it's like, boy, I like Pac-Man 
[01:22:00]  better than I like, uh, uh, uh, Dead Rising, or, it's amazing to watch these things, but  I'm saying, some of those games that you, have less heart, when it has some heart, when  somebody takes advantage, and they go, man, I can make something really good, and they  make something really good with that, their, their situation, it's like, that 300 looks,  it looks like somebody said, I am gonna do something special.  Yeah.  But then you get, well, it's just showing that it's developing, you know, the CGI, it's getting  better, and people are using it, uh, more effectively. 
[01:22:30]  The remake of, um, Godzilla was horrific, like, that new Godzilla, and you go, ugh, but  then, like, Independence Day, where you watch it now, and you see the flaws, you see how  bad, much better CGI is, but it was, it's still good.  And then move forward to, you know, we talked about it one time when you were on the show,  King Kong was just amazing, they, that, you fell for that damn ape.  It was ridiculous.  Ten years ago, you wouldn't feel for that ape if they did the movie ten years ago, because  it would, it would obviously look like a, an overgrown robot or something. 
[01:23:00]  Exactly, man.  Yeah, it would look cartoony.  Right.  But now they're figuring out how to get the facial expressions, uh, in such a way, like,  damn, that is, that, that's a real fucking...  But these, what do they call these people now?  Generation what's, what do they call these people now?  The 20 year olds?  What are they?  I think I'm Generation X.  Used to be X.  You're, um...  I'm...  Wait a minute, you're, um...  Generation A.  Baby boomer.  I'm...  Are you a baby boomer?  I'm the tail end of the baby boomer.  You're a tail end baby boomer.  I'm a Generation X, you're a tail end, what are you, baby boomer?  You're an end about the same age?  Tail end baby boomer.  Tail end.  So these people now, what are these, these things now? 
[01:23:30]  What are these...  We're the last of the post-war people that were screwing.  Generation YZ.  I don't know, I think there's a Y in there somewhere, who knows?  Hey, uh...  You, uh, you, I don't know if it's ruined Kong for me or enlightened me in it, but I was  watching it, uh, just last night it was on.  And that whole scene where he fights that, uh, T-Rex that is trying to kill her, and then  he snaps the jaw and just, boof, boof, and turns his back on her, and he's like, oof. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Like, you know, and I'm thinking, and I turn to my girl and I'm like, that is exactly what  Patrice said.  Like, he is now saying to her, look, that's the monster.  I'm not the monster here.  And then he just bounces.  And then he just, yeah, throws her on his back, goes, yeah, come with me, let me show  you something.  I said, I don't need, and when I first got, when I first, you know, because I heard, what's  that, the guy, uh, that guy?  Peter, uh, Peter Jackson.  Peter Jackson, yeah.  When he was explaining how he couldn't edit his, the end of the movie, because it just 
[01:24:30]  hurt him too much.  Yeah, yeah.  I said, oh, man, so I, and when I finally got the DVD, I was fast-forwarding so I don't  really get connected.  Don't get all connected to him.  And I'm like, I don't ever want my monsters to be this, I don't want to care about my  monsters.  I don't want to like a monster like that.  I don't want to ever.  The top of the Empire State Building, when he takes her and puts her inside, and they,  after she, you know, waves the planes off, and, and, you know, they all, they turn because 
[01:25:00]  they don't want to shoot her, and Kong just knows, you know, how this is going to end.  Yeah.  So he takes her, puts her inside, and they kind of look at each other, and it's like,  no, it's over.  No.  It's over, baby.  And the 33 version didn't do that.  Let me, the 33 version?  Yeah.  It wasn't, in this one, it was like, I'm going to, I'm going to destroy New York because I'm  a scared animal.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yep.  I don't want that to happen.  In the 33 version, he's looking for the white woman, and he, he looks at this white woman  and goes, that's not you, and he bites her face off. 
[01:25:30]  I need that.  For him to die, he has to say, this ain't my white woman, I'm going to bite her face  off.  I'm going to kill everybody in sight.  In sight.  In my way, right.  In my way.  He didn't kill anybody.  It was like, he was just some scared animal.  I don't need that.  How sad did he look when he's sitting there in the chains, like in the original ones, in  the 30s.  The curtain went up, he's standing up, and he's all, with the big stupid smile, and the  claymation moving and everything.  In this one, they opened it up, Jack Black is standing there, and Kong's just kind of 
[01:26:00]  going, like, he's like, how the hell did I get myself into this mess?  I'm the man.  Yeah.  He was all scarred up.  They explained what a great animal he, I don't need that.  I don't need that.  And they crank the chains up, so he stands up, and then he's like, and then he looks  down, and that ain't his chick, and the flash is gone, and he's just pissed.  That's why I love the movie Orca, and people hate Orca.  I love Orca. 
[01:26:30]  Jaws rip off.  I don't care.  It's just...  Stupid Jaws rip off.  He got revenge.  Orca's baby flopped out all day.  He got his revenge, and he swam away.  I need that in my life.  Hey, no killing.  Don't hurt bad monsters we care about.  Hey, let's go to...  Makes us sad, dammit.  Let's go to Patrick in East Rockaway.  Patrick, what's up?  What do you have for the show today?  Hey, guys, Patrice said that Linda Blair can't walk straight anymore because of The Exorcist,  and that's not true.  It's actually because she dated Rick James in the 80s. 
[01:27:00]  There you go.  I saw that coming a mile away, dude.  There you go.  Hey, so we started the show with top searches on the internet.  Right.  And this is where we...  And this started this whole pop culture run we're doing on today's show.  Top 10, like, internet searches.  Number 10 was Christmas.  Number 9 was Nintendo, the Wii.  Number 8 is WWE.  That's a surprise.  It must be something specific, though.  Just W...  No, that's what you're throwing in the search engine.  WWE. 
[01:27:30]  Just...  And then push...  Yeah.  And then push...  And push enter.  Yeah.  You sure there's no extra context to this?  No.  This is it.  This is what you're, you know, popping in your search engine.  The top 10 today.  There must be a big match going on or something.  I don't know.  There has to be a reason, you know.  I used to...  We talked about it.  We used to love the wrestling.  It's coming back a little bit.  I'm starting to take a peek again.  It had its complete...  Well, all his big stars...  It was huge.  Like, what?  Seven years ago?  Eight years ago?  Three years ago when Rock left it was... 
[01:28:00]  Well, no.  I mean, Vince McMahon was feeling the pressure as far as being PC and stuff.  Because his storylines were beyond ridiculous and over the top, which we loved.  But then, you know, the PC police got their grubby little hands involved.  And he had to kind of...  He kind of had to, I don't know, change things up a little bit, unfortunately.  And it hurt him.  And he knew it was going to hurt him.  But it looked like he was losing advertisers at the time and stuff.  He had no choice.  It sucks. 
[01:28:30]  We know what we like.  The rating should mean something.  You know?  Well, I think I said this before.  At some point, I don't understand.  It's like...  And maybe you can tell me.  I mean, you're a little closer to, like, that kind of money than I am.  It's like, if I'm Coca-Cola or if I'm Pepsi, and some white lady writes a letter about how she's offended by me,  why do I not write a letter back and go, kiss my ass? 
[01:29:00]  We've been saying it for years.  I'm Coca-Cola.  We've been saying it for years, Anthony and I.  How does Coke feel the pressure of some group?  Coca-Cola, I forgot what the name is, but it's like, what do they call it when, like, something so big that the name of the product actually represents what it is?  Like, Q-tip is a cotton swab, but people call cotton swabs Q-tips.  Zerox is a good one.  It's the biggest one, yeah.  It's just, so how can people ban against Coca-Cola? 
[01:29:30]  Say if Coca-Cola is WWE's sponsor, and some group goes, we don't like you, why not go, get out of my face?  We've been saying it for years.  We're waiting for these corporations to go, you know what?  Kiss my ass.  Because the customer's always right.  Who can ban?  Who could boycott Coca-Cola?  And here's the problem.  The people that enjoy something, they're not writing their letters.  So these letters that come in where they're hating something, you know, they look that much more impressive because it's not followed up by millions of letters from people going, hey, I just want to let you know, I love, you know, your advertising on the WWE or what have you. 
[01:30:00]  At what point can mothers against tickling say, I don't, you know, I am, you are not to put, we're going to boycott Sprite.  Really?  Are you?  Yeah, just name one boycott that worked.  But these companies, they fold, I understand, we've been saying this, fold.  One time, why don't you play it out, see what happens.  Tide is not big enough to go, you know what?  Yeah, they're going to go broke because of a boycott. 
[01:30:30]  Everyone's going to stop buying their product.  I don't understand, but what is it, though?  That's what I'm asking.  Like, what is it?  It bums me out.  It really does because it's affected us in our careers and stuff.  It's like, at one time, just stand up to these asses and tell them to go F themselves.  I don't want to say the wrong thing.  This is what gets, like, the Mel Gibson situation.  Yeah.  I'm like saying, I'm like, he's worth something like half a billion dollars from the Passion of the Christ. 
[01:31:00]  It was all his money.  And he said what somebody calls anti-Semitic.  He doesn't have enough money to be anti-Semitic if he feels like it.  A half a billion doesn't do it for you.  Like, if he goes, I don't like Jews and I think they start wars.  What?  He doesn't have enough money to go, ah, shut up.  Yeah.  I'm going to make Apocalypto.  There's nothing you can do about it.  Yeah, I got enough money now to finance my own movies.  Go screw.  Coca-Cola doesn't have enough money to say, you know what, we don't need any more.  It's mind-boggling. 
[01:31:30]  Maybe we could get, like, some kind of marketing expert to explain it because I don't get it.  All right.  Hey, moving on.  So the list continues.  WWE, eighth place.  Lindsay Lohan in seventh place.  This is where all the hot chicks.  People are just searching out hot chicks all day long on their computers.  All day long.  Lindsay Lohan.  What did Lindsay Lohan do?  She does what she does.  The recent thing is she talked to Al Gore and wants Al Gore to help her as far as the media goes.  She talked to Hillary Clinton, thinks Hillary Clinton could help her with her drinking problem. 
[01:32:00]  She's nuts.  What is she again?  Oh, she's the one that's deconstructed in front of her face.  She's nuts.  Yeah, she's completely falling apart in front of our faces.  Paris Hilton is in sixth place.  People just can't get enough of the Paris Hilton on the Internet search.  Oh, no.  Beyonce is up there, number five.  Most searched out today.  NASA is in fourth place.  NASA.  NASA.  What?  The Bahamas.  NASA to Bahamas.  NASA.  It's NASA.  NASA, sorry. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah, of course.  NASA.  Well, we got a space shuttle that's being delayed.  It's sitting on a launch pad.  Hey, you know what?  It was interesting about this.  This is why I really like white people for certain reasons, is that just the things y'all do that no one else cares about.  Do you know why they didn't launch?  Why?  The launch was going.  They found a cricket in the...  No.  They found a cricket a mile away from the launch pad, so they had to shut down the whole operation.  No, it was...  You ever see the stuff they shut it down for?  This is why they shut it down.  They would... 
[01:33:00]  Five, four, three, and then they go, can't do it.  If they didn't launch exactly when they were supposed to, it was to meet the space station.  Oh, right.  And if they didn't launch right then, they wouldn't have...  They didn't have enough gas to get to the space station.  You can't just launch whenever you want and go to where you want to go.  You can't just leave?  I know.  Like people say...  I thought you could just leave.  Yeah.  People say all the time when the shuttle burnt up on re-entry, it's like, why couldn't they, 
[01:33:30]  you know, look, saw there was a problem, and then dock with the space station?  It's like, what do you think?  It's like driving to the corner gas station or something like that.  They go, they are nowhere near the space station.  They don't have enough fuel to get there.  Everything's all figured out.  Did you know that already?  You can't just go there.  Ed knows all this stuff.  Yes.  I mean, you knew that.  Yeah, yeah.  I knew that.  That's why, you know, you can't do that.  That's amazing to me.  The window of opportunity closed.  You know, it's all figured out in advance.  Yes.  Kenny knows something about this. 
[01:34:00]  That's not what I heard, not for nothing.  I heard it was too cloudy.  So, like, if they took off and something went wrong, they couldn't land manually because  it was too cloudy.  Right.  That's what I heard, not for nothing.  But then they have to delay it a certain amount of times until they get back in a position  where they can meet up with the space station again.  You're absolutely right.  It's the window of opportunity.  All right, listen.  I see Keith the cops here.  That means he might have some homeless people for the homeless shopping spree. 
[01:34:30]  We'll talk to Keith after we take a break.  Homeless shopping spree is a week from tomorrow, by the way.  To finish up the searches for today on the Internet, some broad name, Aishwarya Ray?  What?  She's part of Bollywood.  What is that?  She looks like Christy Alley if Christy Alley had a little Indian blood in her. 
[01:35:00]  I don't know.  She's the top, she's number three on the top searched.  Wow, she does look like a.  On the Internet there.  Don't be surprised.  It's like.  She's part of the Bollywood.  There's 18 million Indians, man, so.  A lawyer in India has actually filed a lawsuit because an actress, Aishwarya Ray, kissed a man in a movie?  Oh, boy.  Well.  We're on the same planet with these people.  Stone her.  A lawyer in India has actually filed a lawsuit because an actress kissed a man in a movie.  Bollywood actress Ray, said to be one of the world's most beautiful women, kissed actor 
[01:35:30]  in a scene that severely upset the man.  He claimed that women felt offended after watching the scene and it promoted vulgarity in society.  Holy crap.  We think we're like really uptight sexually and stuff like that.  This was killing me about.  It kills me about Indians and like Chinese people.  Yeah.  There's.  Between them is 18 billion of them.  Yeah.  They do a lot of sex.  Yeah.  But what is wrong with them where it's like, what is wrong with them? 
[01:36:00]  They get so crazy like this.  There's tons of them.  All right.  I'm talking tons.  Wow.  He claimed that women felt offended after watching the scene and it promoted vulgarity in society.  Bollywood actors are conveying vulgarity in the society.  These films cannot be watched with our families.  Families, they are so vulgar at times.  So that's why she's on the list.  And then the list ends with Jessica Simpson in second place and Britney Spears.  That's what we're searching for on the Internet today. 
[01:36:30]  Of course, Britney.  It's all about Britney and her lack of underwear.  Britney, it's all about her shot.  Lack of panty.  The shot.  All right.  We got to step aside.  We got Keith.  Homeless shopping spree.  A week from Saturday, he's got some homeless dudes that we're going to say hi to.  Four-year-old kid sexually harasses female school employee.  Ah.  We got Tyra stuff.

Go to 923freefm.com for all the details.  Details.  All right.  Yeah.  Getting into some other things.  We got a four-year-old kid sexually harassing a female school employee. 
[01:38:30]  Is this even possible?  Well, is this even possible?  Maybe he was just hungry.  Four-year-old.  Maybe he was just hungry.  Maybe he was hungry.  Hungry for what, man?  Well, let's just keep it at that.  Maybe it was lunchtime, you know?  Boy.  We read these stories every once in a while.  It's like, hey, I mean, come on.  The kid's 12.  Will you stop?  Four. 
[01:39:00]  Four years old.  Four years old.  Damn.  DeMarcus Blackwell's four-year-old son was lining up to get on the bus after school last month  when he was accused of rubbing his face in the chest of a female employee.  The principal of La Vega Primary School sent a letter to the Blackwells.  It said the pre-kindergardener demonstrated inappropriate physical behavior  interpreted as sexual contact and or sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment.  And did he do it to get a spanking?  Yeah.  I'm going to do it because I like getting spanked, too. 
[01:39:30]  Don't you have to know what sexual harassment is before you do it?  I don't think so.  I really think you need some kind of working knowledge of it.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I think women are running so rampant now that they really believe that now.  That a four-year-old.  They're trying to take our testosterone before it develops.  Before you even have it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  You're not to know.  We'll be gone soon. 
[01:40:00]  Men will be gone.  Yeah.  Men will be gone.  We'll just have nice cups of estrogen.  You're almost close to how you eat egg whites.  This girl's food you eat, the egg whites and whole cherry tomatoes  and all that healthy stuff is a woman trick.  I bet you pork and oil sandwiches keep you alive for years.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, they're getting rid of the trans fats, so.  Yeah, the restaurants, but I mean, I'll probably keep you alive.  But it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just a, I'm telling you, there are women scientists 
[01:40:30]  somewhere trying to, because it's the last thing that they have that we got.  Getting paid less than the men's scientists, by the way.  I'm good.  Good thing.  Good.  Because let me tell you something.  Oh, like Lisa Leslie, and it's kind of the same, Lisa Leslie's not playing in the WNBA this year  because she's pregnant.  Do you understand?  It's absolutely true.  Oh, my God.  She's pregnant, so she's off. 
[01:41:00]  So, so.  I didn't hear that.  It's just like an ACL tear.  Yeah.  Donovan McNabb is out for a year.  Because.  The same nine months.  Know why he's out for a year?  He had to tear his ACL.  Because they had to ask the entire stadium to try to find his kneecap.  Hey, the kneecap is somewhere in the stadium.  Can someone please return it so we can get, so we can put him back together.  Her?  The missionary position put her out for a year.  Right.  For nine months. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  You understand what I'm saying?  So this is just, it's just a plan, a four-year-old.  It's just to get them to go.  It's like, we're going to stop this now.  So that eventually, like I said, like if you watch football, they're taking out what it is.  I mean, did you play sports?  No.  You were sports guy.  Hell yeah.  It's a testosterone thing.  Like, I know you talked about it was the Giants, the Kiwanuka, when he grabbed a guy and then let him go.  And I'm sure you know why. 
[01:42:00]  It's just because you don't want to get a penalty and all that.  But when I played football, when we hit somebody, he didn't move.  When he went into some type of convulsion, we didn't hold the hands of the other team and pray for him to get up.  Like, we would hump over his body, do a dance, and then when they rolled him out, he didn't give a thumbs up to my crowd saying he's okay.  I'm not paralyzed.  We would tip his thing over before I went to the ambulance.  Not only that, you'd throw snowballs at him on the way out.  You played a kill. 
[01:42:30]  Hey, speaking of that, you know, my nephew, Carson, he's playing football.  He's really good for his age.  He's eight.  And it's pretty impressive what eight-year-olds could do on a football field.  I had no clue, okay?  Right, right.  But one of his teammates was injured, and everyone gets down on their knees or one knee, and I'm like, I go to my brother, Scott, and I'm like, what is that about?  They're praying for his health.  They're, like, out of respect for, like, an injured player.  This is the new thing they do is, like, everyone goes down on their knees until they find out how injured the kid is or, you know, or wait for them to... 
[01:43:00]  What the hell?  To, you know, to, God, why can't I talk to them?  To carry the kid off the field.  In 1986, if you had an open shot at somebody, and you hit them, and you fell down and did not move, you were a hero.  That was your nickname, the Paralyzer.  Humongous.  Humongous, the Paralyzer. 
[01:43:30]  You were humongous.  That is what you did playing football.  That's the last bastion of the testosterone to get it out.  Now, when you're running, and they got this new, for the wide receivers called, what do they call it in a position?  You're in a vulnerable position.  So some guy all day long is wanting to get this evil hit in, and you have to use all your ability, your speed, your anger, and then stop because you're worried about his spinal column. 
[01:44:00]  Because he's in a vulnerable position.  There's some paralyzed people out there that's terrible, but that's why you play football.  You play to either not be paralyzed, or to paralyze them.  It's a game of paralysis.  Yeah, you're a...  It used to be you were a gladiator, man.  Yes!  And it went pretty much.  Now you do that, and everyone looks at you like, oh, man, what's wrong with that guy?  It's nothing.  It's good sportsmanship.  Get in some prayer circle with the other team?  Listen, because we've got to move on to a few other things. 
[01:44:30]  We've got the other clip here, but you jumped on football, so let's do this real fast.  The football picks.  We do football picks every week.  Sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  That's 1-888-GET-DISH.  Football picks.  Can you do them for me, Patrice?  I'll do them.  Giants, Panthers.  Giants.  I'm going to say Giants, man.  I'm going to say it.  They got it.  Giants away?  Are you insane?  They got to, man.  They got to.  They just need it.  They need it, and they're going to do it.  Oh, boy. 
[01:45:00]  Are you going to take Carolina?  No.  The one-man team, Carolina?  You're doing my picks.  Giants, man.  Giants.  How about Bill's Jets?  Jets at home.  Jets.  Yeah.  Sorry, Buffalo.  We're being hurt in Buffalo.  Yeah, but the Jets.  They're having a tough winter already, yeah.  Buffalo's not.  They're not bums, though, but I just think the Jets is.  All right.  Genie got them going.  Vikings, Lions, Lions at home.  We're on in Detroit.  Do the right thing, Patrice.  You want Vikings, man. 
[01:45:30]  Vikings.  All right, Vikings.  We're home for Spanish with Detroit.  We got the Titans and the Texans.  All the Titans.  Jesus, dude.  How about one home team?  And then you got the Eagles and Redskins.  Jeff Garcia.  Redskins.  Noah.  Redskins are at home.  What you call out for the rest of them?  Redskins are at home.  At home?  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  RFK.  I don't want to.  No, do what you're feeling. 
[01:46:00]  Jeff Garcia, man.  They're getting it.  You see them play the other day.  We'll go Philly.  Holy.  Well.  We go Philly.  There you go.  One for five for me.  I'll have the results on Monday.  Thank you, Dish Network.  One home team out of five?  Look at the teams.  I understand that to a point.  You know, there's nobody coming to Detroit.  They're going to beat Minnesota.  How?  Who's their quarterback?  I know Brad Johnson is the quarterback for Minnesota. 
[01:46:30]  Who's the quarterback for the Detroit Lions?  Just some truck driver.  That's insane.  All right.  Here's the other clip.  Four-year-old kid sexually harassed a female school employee.  Back to the normal sexual behavior of children centers around curiosity and fun, pleasure.  Blackwell got a response from LaVega administration.  The sexual references on the discipline referral were removed.  But the thing that makes Blackwell most upset, they told him,  your request for an apology by the aide and removal of all paperwork regarding this incident is denied. 
[01:47:00]  Now the young students file will refer to the incident as, quote, inappropriate physical contact.  And Blackwell says he will continue to fight the district.  I'm not going to let no four-year-old child carry this type of weight for his whole life that you can reach back and say,  this activity started when he was four years old.  What if he is, like, a rapist, though?  Then he could say, hey.  Yeah, but that's, come on.  Why would you even stop saying that?  Happened before.  Don't say that.  Because it's a paper trail. 
[01:47:30]  That's your whole life is a paper trail, dude.  Mm-hmm.  And that's how they judge you.  And if this kid never gets in trouble with the law.  But he'll have that.  It'll be, like, when I got in trouble, the first thing they did was go to my paper trail because I never was in trouble before.  And if something would happen.  And so they saw F-minus.  They saw, you know, it was just because it wasn't in a context.  It wasn't like, hey, man, I just like to joke around and I did that and this, that, and the third.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like, this guy, he's a bad student.  They just made a profile based on.  Bad student, no father, half-brother that he hates. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, all that.  And they made me.  Calls himself humongous.  Humongous.  He daydreams about paralyzing people.  And this kid, they're going to do that to him.  But it's not our fault.  I mean, it's not women's fault that this is happening.  It's our fault.  We're missing the observation.  We got Frank in Brooklyn.  Frank, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, you know what's funny?  I was just thinking about it.  A four-year-old kid could only be about maybe three feet high.  Yeah.  Where the hell was the teacher?  And down? 
[01:48:30]  He probably had his own stepladder.  He just carries around his stepladder.  I guarantee she was one of those fat, ugly women and her breasts went down that far.  Yeah.  To a four-year-old's head.  He's climbing up.  I got to get to those boobies.  It's like the Mount Everest for a four-year-old.  The teacher should just rub his head and say, come on, get on the bus, you crazy kid.  Yeah.  Does your jammy get hard at four?  Yeah, they did.  I don't know.  I don't remember.  We might have to ask the mommies out there.  I have no idea. 
[01:49:00]  Four-year-old boys get aroused?  Can it be sexual if it's not sexual?  I think he's just, yeah, being a dopey kid.  I have no idea.  Doing something dopey.  He used to be a dopey kid.  Yeah, the teacher would have like whapped him in the back of the head.  I cannot believe that an adult would do that to a kid like that.  I can't believe it.  And what if he is a damn rapist?  He ought to be shot for that.  Too early to tell.  Yeah.  Maybe not, though.  They say that stuff.  Oh, come on.  I say chemical castration at four. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, they're going to hook him up to that plodismograph?  That's it.  See what turns him on?  I already say the four-year-old was probably trying to wipe his nose.  John Kitna is the answer.  Thank you, booby man.  What, for Detroit?  Yeah, the QB.  Exactly.  Hey, you know what?  Why don't we do this?  We got some news teases.  We got the latest batch of news teases.  I like those.  We absolutely love the news teases.  Are they scary?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, for the new listeners. 
[01:50:00]  News teases are scary.  Can't get enough of the scary news teases that the local news does to you.  And they're there just to make you, yeah, I know.  To make you tune in.  To make you tune in and watch the entire news.  News entertainment.  It's always something they say that you have to stick around.  Like, you know, dangerous toy.  Your kid may be playing with this particular toy, and it could kill him.  Certain car is being recalled for something extremely dangerous.  Could be life-threatening.  We'll tell you which car. 
[01:50:30]  Could you just say it?  I got to drive to work.  Yeah, but they want you just to watch the entire news program.  They don't give a crap about you, your kids, the car you drive.  Just tune in.  They just want you to tune in a little longer than you usually do.  You think the news is doing anything?  There's a woman right now.  I'll just turn and look at the news with a Muppet.  But she's talking.  She has a Muppet.  And the Muppet's sexier.  Is there, excuse me, did 10 U.S. soldiers get killed yesterday? 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  I mean, is the world in turmoil?  Yeah.  Why is there a puppet on the news?  Why do they have a minute to put a puppet on the news?  And then interview the puppet like it's real.  Like there's some importance in this puppet.  I think there's more important things for the news to cover.  But people's attention spans are a split second.  And they can't really get into details on stories. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, I know.  I wasn't paying attention to myself either.  Jackasses.  I'm going to be pontificating.  Why don't I shut up?  Your sickness turns you into a prognosis.  The dog masticator?  So we call out the news from time to time and do scary news teases.  They're just hilarious to us.  They're just beyond hilarious.  And we encourage you to send in your local scary news teases, please.  Please. 
[01:52:00]  Go to opianthony.com.  There's an email address for, I guess, Danny to send in the scary news teases.  Here is the first one for today.  Plus the dairy aisle.  What's really in some of your favorite foods?  Next.  The dairy aisle.  What's really in your favorite foods?  What did you...  What's in your favorite foods?  Mexicans.  Sleeping and going to the bathroom.  And giving you E. coli, apparently.  Yeah.  Not port-a-potties in the spinach. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  What's really...  That's the...  There you go.  What's really in your food?  Mexicans.  Yeah.  They're laying down in the field of spinach because it's soft on their back.  Watch the apocalypto sleeping.  And...  They're rummaging through some carrots at the supermarket and you just see a sombrero pop  out under there.  I'm going to make you laugh all day.  Wiping with a spinach leafy's hand in you.  That's what's wrong with the spinach. 
[01:53:00]  My mother was like...  She just said to my mom, I was talking to my mom, she's like...  She works in...  You know, she knows health care.  She's been in health care a long time.  She's like...  Mm-mm-mm.  Mexicans.  And I'm like, what?  And she just goes, you know, E. coli is a human bacteria from...  And I go, what?  And I was like, what?  The Mexicans are sleeping.  They're sleeping and going to the bathroom in our spinach.  That is really funny.  Getting us back. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, wow.  We're getting some kind of echo.  That's interesting.  We might want to turn that off immediately because it's really distracting.  Where's that coming from?  I have no idea.  Hey, on the instant feedback, we've got to back up a second.  Big Duties Jay from Jersey.  Opie, you asked, by your logic, every team in the NFL would be effing 8-8.  Come on, man.  The reality is home teams win more often than away teams.  That's all I'm getting at.  What was it, on Pal Talk or something?  Yeah, all of a sudden it popped through. 
[01:54:00]  Okay.  Okay.  All right, so what really is in your favorite food?  Patrice says Mexicans.  Mexicans are...  Hard-working Mexicans are in your food.  Was it Mexicans, Danny?  Yeah, Danny, what's the answer to that one?  No, it wasn't Mexicans.  Are you guys done guessing?  Yeah.  Well, what really is in your favorite food?  Dirt.  Well, the dairy aisle?  Yeah, probably some dirt or milk. 
[01:54:30]  You've got to think milk.  Yeah, I'm thinking dairy.  They did say dairy, right?  Yes.  A chopped up four-year-old?  I'll give you a clue.  I'll give you a clue because on the visual of the teas, they showed yogurt.  Oh.  The cultures.  Bacteria.  Bacteria.  No.  Okay, hold on.  Rotten fruit.  Nope.  A finger.  No.  Let me think.  It's yogurt.  It's dairy. 
[01:55:00]  Who gives a crap?  I have no idea.  What is it?  It's actually the artificial flavors in some yogurts.  They actually used crushed beetles to color the artificial flavoring.  And, of course, on the ingredients, it just says artificial flavors, so you have no idea  that you're eating crushed beetles.  Who cares?  Did they actually use crushed beetles?  Yeah.  Why would they do that?  I don't know.  Insects are...  They get a bad rap.  I'm sure there's a lot of insects out there that taste good. 
[01:55:30]  Why don't we eat more insects?  That's what I'm saying.  We eat a lot of stuff in this world.  There's enough of those bastards around.  Flies look delicious.  Plenty of them.  Bring some insects in.  I'll eat some insects.  I'm going to try some insects.  You're like, why do I have no problem eating those king crab legs?  Right.  But I won't.  You're a septic, sir.  Dude, those are giant insects.  Those are big, giant bug-like things.  Yeah, they're giant bugs.  I'm sure some fries.  Not literally, but...  Yeah, something like that.  A praying mantis sandwich.  Dan's going to beat you over the head with the break sign. 
[01:56:00]  I know.  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll continue with news teases.  And we've got to talk to this homeless dude.  Homeless shopping spree right around the corner.  A week from tomorrow.  Are we going to announce the mall soon, or what?  Or are we going to announce the mall day of the homeless shopping spree?  I think we've got to announce or get the word out to maybe the ONA Pest where we're going to be  so we get some people showing up at the mall.  Maybe we'll...  What?  How about the day before?  All right, the day before?  All right, next Friday we'll announce what mall we're going to for the homeless shopping spree. 
[01:56:30]  And we'll get into all the details about the homeless shopping spree next week on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  That's your cue, but you're too busy eating.  Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle home spree.  Whoa, hey.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along. 
[01:57:00]  Golden buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony show.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Coming Saturday, December 9th at midnight, the Fan and Sam show.  One's a comic genius.  The other has no concept of what works on radio.  Wait, so which one is?  It's a meeting of the minds as extreme intelligence meets mental retardation. 
[01:57:30]  Who's the retard?  Our phone screener?  One is reasonable looking.  The other is a dog-faced freak.  I thought we were both pretty handsome.  One is on the tall side.  The other is average, if not slightly below.  What, you mean in height?  Than, am I the...  Just let the man finish.  The Fan and Sam show, Saturday, December 9th at midnight.  Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows, everything that's wonderful is what I feel when we're... 
[01:58:00]  Nothing gets you motivated to do a radio show like seeing the guys you're doing the show with  lounged out on couches, completely tired and sick.  I'm just...  And then they slowly make their way back to the microphones.  Oh, what a buzzkill.  This is the O.P. and Anthony show.  I gotta tell you, really good show today.  Really good show.  They don't see that crap out there, but I gotta...  No.  I gotta be the eyes of the people sometimes. 
[01:58:30]  Man.  Bring them into what's going on in studio.  We got Keith the Cop.  He's here.  You got someone for the homeless shopping spree?  We want to get another news tease in here, but tell us real fast who you got.  Yeah, we have...  He's kind of like Pizarro Tippy Tom, this guy.  Yeah?  He's a guy I've been mistaken for Tippy Tom.  Oh, really?  A few times when I'm out there picking him up.  He looks like him?  Yeah, he gets pissed when you call him Tippy Tom, too.  Oh, he knows Tippy.  Oh, he knows Tippy Tom.  They go at it.  So, I tried to get Tippy Tom today, too, but I think the homeless outreach was out there 
[01:59:00]  picking these guys up.  It's pretty cold here in New York.  What do they do?  Take them to shelters?  Take them to shelters.  They force them to go to shelters.  Most of these guys don't even want to go to the shelters when it gets cold out, so...  Yeah, so I think they were one step ahead of me this morning wherever I was going because  every place I went, damn.  All right.  All the details for the homeless shopping spree next week.  Bogart the homeless.  Next week on the show.  We'll tell you the mall.  We'll tell you what we're doing.  And usually, well, last year we were only on XM and we still had close to a thousand  people, I think it was, show up at the mall. 
[01:59:30]  This year, I can't even imagine the numbers.  It could get a little crazy this year.  Well, you know...  Because we encourage listeners to go to the mall as we do the homeless shopping spree.  Help out the homeless.  Help out the show.  Tell us what's going on.  Videotape it.  Whatever you do.  What is it going to be?  We're going to announce it next week.  Okay.  So, we don't want them pre-planning out there.  We usually surprise the mall at the last minute because they don't want us there.  They don't want our listeners there.  They don't want the homeless there.  They just want their peaceful shopping.  And nothing to disrupt that. 
[02:00:00]  All their snobbery.  They want snobs to come in and spend a lot of money.  What's wrong with the homeless coming in?  Their money's just as good.  Just smells a little bad.  What's the cash limit this year?  I don't know.  I don't know what they figured out.  I think we're doing $200 American Express.  And you gave the look, but let me tell you what happened.  So, each homeless guy gets $200, but the listeners, it's unbelievable what they end up doing.  Some of these guys will spend $1,000 on the homeless.  Yeah, they'll pick a guy and then shop with him and buy shoes for him and everything. 
[02:00:30]  Andrew, our buddy Andrew, he needs glasses.  Yeah.  So, I'm sure there's some kind of a vision center or one of those kind of places.  Take him in there and buy him some glasses.  But, I insist, the listeners get to pick the frames.  See, a lot of people think, I'm the cruel bastard, man.  This guy is brutal.  I just love the fact that he'll be able to see perfectly clear, but have the worst big, awful glasses on his head. 
[02:01:00]  Really big frames that make him look like he's a frog.  Yeah.  Something horrible.  I earned his glasses.  But, some advice to the listeners that are going to help out the homeless this year.  Can you buy them stuff that can fit in pockets so they're not easy targets when we throw them back on the street?  Because then we get the update.  Because we all feel happy about ourselves that we did something for the homeless.  We're so good.  And they come back from the mall with brand new coats and shoes.  And they're all just styling, some of these guys.  And we get a report from Keith a few days later.  Oh, yeah.  The next day, the guy we had last year, Jose, remember the little Spanish guy with the beard? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  The next day, he had all beat-up clothes on again.  He was missing his new sneakers.  He was just a mess.  Just got rolled.  How about a homeless home spree?  Why don't you guys, what's wrong with you dudes, man?  They pull him apart like he's a cricket all of a sudden.  They're like, I'll take that.  I'll take that.  So, the advice would be maybe stuff they could kind of hide a little bit better when they're back on the streets.  All right.  Go get the homeless dude.  Let's do another news tease here.  Scary news tease is, you know, hopefully you don't need the setup. 
[02:02:00]  We just think they're hilarious and we play them and goof on them.  Here's the next one.  Think you're safe when the ATM door locks behind you?  Think again.  The thing a thief could use to open it up.  And you probably have one in your purse or wallet.  Yes, behind you.  It's probably a credit card.  It's any credit card with a magnetic strip.  With a magnetic strip or the old school of opening up a door with a credit card? 
[02:02:30]  A popsicle stick when it's getting ready to close.  Yeah.  How about a hold that door, please?  Yeah, excuse me.  I want to do some banking after I bash your head in.  Hey, it's Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  I think we're...  Wow!  Oh, all right.  Yeah, there is a tippy-toe look.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  So let's get the answer to this and then we'll move on to what's going on over there.  So, wait. 
[02:03:00]  And you're saying another credit card with a magnetic strip is all you need?  Yeah, well, I know that in the past I have used like a credit card or something that, you know, I don't use in the ATM machine.  And it opens the doors?  Something with a magnetic strip, yeah.  I had no idea.  Yeah.  Who cares?  Who cares, though?  Who's stupid enough to like go into one of those, you know, ATMs late at night by themselves anyway?  Aren't you mostly...  A lot of people.  Really?  Yeah.  With no one around?  People are really stupid.  No one around, only one in one of those things. 
[02:03:30]  Apparently, some guy just got shot doing that.  He was uptown.  Yeah.  Took some money out.  Yeah.  Walked out.  Yeah.  And got shot and killed right there.  Took his money.  All right.  Is that what it is, Danny?  Well, yeah.  The obvious answer is going to be the credit card ATM cards because everybody has one.  So, of course, you can get into any bank with that.  But the one thing that they were pushing was driver's licenses, too, because they have a magnetic strip on them.  And apparently, anything with a magnetic strip will get you into a bank. 
[02:04:00]  I had no clue.  I learned something new today.  I'm going to try that.  It's easy.  Yeah.  Just to walk in very close to them.  Yeah.  Just follow someone in there.  Just go right in.  Or you sit there and wait until they finish getting their money out and rob them.  And you wait until they come out.  Yeah.  We'll try to get...  There's no cameras.  We'll try to get one more scary news tease on before we head over to XM.  But who is this guy again, Keith?  What's his name?  You.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  I'm not no fucking Tippy Tom. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, Keith was right.  How about Greg Allman?  Hey, Al just dumped that out.  He had to.  He had to keep it clean.  But I said, hey, Tippy Tom.  And the guy cursed and said, I don't know.  Hi, sir.  What's your name?  Big Red.  Big what?  Big Red.  Oh, Big Red.  Hey, Big Red.  What's going on, bro?  He's got some red hair there.  So he's Big Red.  There you go.  All over my body. 
[02:05:00]  All right.  And Big Red lives out on the street?  Yep.  Yeah.  What happened?  Where did...  I'd like to know a little background story.  Where did it go wrong for you?  What happened?  Came to be an alcoholic.  Ah, damn.  Came to be an alcoholic, but not like functioning, where you could go to work or something like  that.  You just want to sit, drink, and hang out, right?  That's all I do.  Yeah.  When did you know you were an alcoholic? 
[02:05:30]  Ten years ago.  How old are you, sir?  Me?  Thirty-six.  No way.  Oh.  You know what went wrong after you lost that match against Coco Beware in WrestleMania 2.  Coco Beware.  Coco stole his two-by-four, hit him in his stomach, and did the bird dance.  So what did you lose because of your drinking?  What point were you up to? 
[02:06:00]  You had a home?  I had a home.  What about family?  I had a family.  Wife and kids?  Family?  Yep.  And then what happened?  You must have been drinking back then, but you were able to hold it together?  Yeah, but then I just gave it up.  You gave it up.  Did you have a job or a career or something?  Yeah.  What did you have?  I'm doing mechanic work.  You were doing mechanic work.  Yeah.  And then, like, what set you off to finally say, that's it, I've had it?  Liquor.  I just started drinking scotch. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, scotch.  What is the top bum juice that, like, the top liquor that creates bums?  Like, if you start drinking that, you shouldn't because it automatically makes you a bum.  Wine.  Wine?  Wine.  Uh-oh.  I'm in trouble.  Dunford, port.  So, like, vodka doesn't make you a bum?  Oh, yeah, it does.  Like, is there a different kind of...  When I leave here and he gets me back by Penn Station, I'm going to buy me a bottle.  A vodka? 
[02:07:00]  A vodka.  Yeah.  How do you get the money for the vodka?  Eh, you know.  A little panhandling.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  Oh, he's got some bucks.  Oh, well...  What's your, uh...  He just got that.  I do side jobs for people.  Oh, what do you do?  Whatever I can do.  Yeah?  To help people with two cases, whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  And then they toss you a few bucks.  And all the cops in Penn Station know me.  Yeah?  And I don't bother nobody.  You're a nice guy.  You're not, like, uh...  Ask him where he found me.  You never arrested him, Pete?  He's a pretty good guy. 
[02:07:30]  He's...  Penn Station.  We never had Penn Station guys before.  This is the first one.  Yeah?  Aren't they a little rougher?  Yeah, yeah.  The Penn Station guys are a little rougher as far as the homeless guy.  I know them all.  Homeless guy.  Yeah.  A lot of people say you look like Tippi Tom, though.  You look like Tippi Tom.  I think you suck dick up.  Wow.  They're dumping out.  You really don't like when someone says you look like...  You do look like him, though.  You gotta admit that.  I know everybody does.  It doesn't mean you do what he does. 
[02:08:00]  What?  It doesn't mean you do what he does, but you look like him.  That's all.  No, no.  I don't do that shit.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  You might as well just keep dumping him, because this is passion.  He's like, man...  Al's having a field day now.  Al.  It's all right, Al.  We understand you gotta do your job.  How do you...  How do you know Tippi Tom?  Because he used to hang around Penn Station.  He used to hang around Penn, and then what? 
[02:08:30]  He got thrown out?  Because he's not a lot around there.  He's...  That guy is...  Because the bad guys don't do that.  I'm a dick in the bathroom.  So where do the sissy bums go?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Down 14th Street.  14th is where the sissy homeless go.  So the sissy bums are on 14th Street.  And you guys don't...  You don't stand for that sissy homeless crap at Penn Station, right?  No, no, no.  You ain't drinking out of my fucking beer.  Oh, there's gonna be no dump left.  Oh, boy.  See?  Al's sweating in the back room. 
[02:09:00]  It's okay, Al.  Let's see how much we have left.  Someone get Al at Al.  Yeah, we might want to just stall a little bit.  Do you get to see any of your family, or do you...  No, I don't bother with them.  You don't bother with them?  They don't bother with you?  Why don't you bother with them?  I don't know where I'm at.  They don't know where I'm at.  They don't know where you're at?  Kids?  What state?  Jersey.  Jersey?  So you have...  How old would your kids be now, you think?  They're all married.  Oh, they're all married?  So they're older and...  Wait.  You don't have any curiosity as to how their life's going? 
[02:09:30]  They don't care about you?  Nope.  I don't...  They don't know where I'm at.  I never let them know where I was.  No, huh?  Wait, they're married?  Because you're only 36, right?  Yeah.  You had kids young?  I was 36.  Huh?  I wish I was 36 again.  I look like you, Tippi Tom.  I don't look like Tippi Tom, you freak.  Well, you told him the same thing, so...  He looks more like Tippi Tom than I do.  Yes, you do.  All you got to do is grow your fucking beard. 
[02:10:00]  I'll grow a beard.  Maybe...  And then I'll bring him up here.  Maybe if Tippi Tom...  He's a little angry.  I'm sorry that I made the comparison.  Thanks, Keith, for this radio gold, by the way, by telling us to do that.  If he ever fucking took a shower with Tippi Tom, there'd be a blizzard out here.  What?  I got it.  I understand.  Excuse me.  I understand.  At least you got a shower here.  When you pick him up again, you give him a shower.  Tippi rarely, rarely showers. 
[02:10:30]  Rarely, rarely smells badly.  He's a stinking sissy bone.  He's a smelly sissy bone.  Yeah, where do you get to take care of yourself?  Don't curse.  Where do I...  Yeah, where do you get to take care of yourself?  Like showers or...  Go down to Bleecker Street.  They go to the church twice a week.  You get different clothes.  Yeah?  Take a shower.  You just need a little motivation.  You know, Tippi Tom doesn't do anything.  See, I take the train down there.  Oh, you do?  You're very coherent.  Like, if you stop drinking, wouldn't you be... 
[02:11:00]  You can straighten it all out, but you just don't want to stop drinking.  I'll never stop drinking.  You don't want to?  Is there something in you that makes you want to stop?  Nope.  What is the drinking...  What does the drinking do?  It just makes you feel better?  You don't...  You don't pay no mind to people.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You forget about your problems.  Yeah, you forget about your problems.  Like me, I was being friendly to you.  I was being friendly, too.  I just made an observation.  Oh, you were calling him Tippi Tom.  I was really interested in it.  I just made an observation.  That's all.  I didn't say he did what Tippi Tom did.  I'm just very...  I'm jealous of his finishing move that he did on the Iron Street. 
[02:11:30]  Brad just came out of the hospital, actually, and he found out the other day that he has  cancer, and the doctor told him to stop drinking, and he's like, I'm not...  What?  Liver?  Pancreas?  Lung?  Lung cancer?  Did you smoke?  I still smoke and drink.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die with a drink.  You smoke still, right?  I'm going to still smoke.  With the lung cancer.  Wow.  You're a trooper.  Screw that cancer, right?  Just keep smoking. 
[02:12:00]  How...  Did he give you any time?  How much time you got left?  Oh, I got time.  It's not bad, but they already clipped it off my lung.  Hey, good luck, bro.  That's what I say.  I take a lot of medication at night.  That's what I like to say.  Oh, medication?  Does it give you a little buzz or interact with the booze at all?  I don't take it in the daytime.  Oh, you don't?  At night, does it put you out?  Where do you sleep?  Where do I sleep?  Yeah.  On 30th Street.  Okay.  Got a little place for...  I got a little room.  The owner gave me a refrigerator, gave me a bed, gave me a TV, gave me a stereo. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, right on, man.  Got new clothes.  Very cool.  All right.  Been there for last year.  You're living pretty good, then?  I just like hanging out in Penn Station and bust people's chops.  Doing some jobs.  You got a little cash in your pocket.  You got your beers.  This is almost...  You're doing all right.  It almost seems like I want to...  He has a fun life.  Yeah.  Would you guys let me hang out there?  Like, you don't have to do anything.  I'm too fat.  Oh, Dan.  No, he did it. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Tippi Tzu just called me too fat.  Hey, are we going to have a problem if you go on the homeless shopping spree with Tippi  Tom?  Oh, no.  Huh?  I ain't going with him.  Huh?  I ain't going with him.  Well, not with him.  Not with him, but we're going to have a whole bus, and you're going to be on the bus with  Tippi Tom as we send you to a mall to do some shopping, or you're going to have a problem  with that.  We'll give you some money.  As long as he stays on one end, I'll say on the other end.  Yeah, that's all.  All right.  He'll...  Because he might try to suck somebody's dick on him. 
[02:13:30]  He's homeless phobic.  I like Big Red.  He's homeless phobic.  He's homeless phobic.  All right.  All right, Big Red.  All right.  Big Red rules.  We've talked about enough, but I...  Big Red rules.  He basically said, as long as Tippi Tom stays on his side of the bus, because he would  most likely to another homeless guy, and we had to dump out.  But hey, Big Red, we like you.  Yeah, you're all right, Big Red.  You're all right.  I speak to you.  All right.  We're going to see you on the homeless shopping spree a week from tomorrow, all right? 
[02:14:00]  Keith will give you all the details.  All right.  Keith knows where to find you.  Keith is great at getting you guys all together for the homeless shopping spree.  Can I say I'm a Caroline Snutt?  All right.  Yeah, what?  Real quick.  Something new this year since we're back on Terrestrial Radio.  I've been in negotiation with WYSP down in Philadelphia, and we're actually  importing a homeless man from Philadelphia to participate on the homeless shopping spree.  Wow.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  A Philly homeless guy.  Yeah.  Nice.  That's very cool.  If he wants to stay here in New York, he can stay.  Yeah.  If Big Red, you want to go down to Philly? 
[02:14:30]  We got to...  Oh, no, no, no.  All right.  Can I plug a show, being that I'm a guy that has a house?  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neal needs to pay his mortgage, so go to Caroline's.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Late shows.  Late shows.  212-757-4100.  1230 tonight?  Yeah.  I'm going to try to make it there, Patrice.  Just shut up.  I'm going to try.  It's been a while.  I've been to your gigs.  Yeah, back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  I'll think about you.  Good point.  When I'm laying in my infirm bed.  Back when y'all had a little extra time.  Oh, I know.  Hey, the gang from MafiaLife.com taking over my brother's restaurant this weekend, and I 
[02:15:00]  think Pal Talkers are going, and One Pess are going, so it's going to be another Opie  and Anthony night out at FH Riley's, my bro's joint, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington  Village.  Which, I guess, tomorrow night, that's all going down?  Right.  Just wanted to give that a quick plug, so.  All right.  Today's football pick, sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Patrice O'Neill, thank you so much.  Thank you.  We ran out of our music, so we're just heading to Ex-M. 
[02:15:30]  Have a great day.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December  21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Ex-M walkover begins now.  Holy shit.  Okay, fuck this.  The walk is officially over.  This is the last walk ever. 
[02:16:00]  Fuck this shit.  Come on.  It is really cold today.  Come on.  Let's go.  I got to at least, I got to even admit it today.  Come on.  Now, this is stupid.  Let's get out of here.  All right, we're going to make a-  All right, we're going to make a-  These poor guys moving drywall.  Let's go.  We're making a decision right now.  Come on.  This is it.  When we go on vacation-  The fucking walkover.  The walkover is over within-  All right, enough of this walkover shit.  Within like two weeks tops. 
[02:16:30]  Two weeks.  Fuck that.  Are you shitting me?  What is this?  A job we're giving two weeks notice for?  Nigga, turn this into the motherfucking drive-over, bitches.  Yeah, this is going to be the drive-over.  Nigga, the motherfucking fly-over.  I don't even know how we can do a drive-over every day.  Motherfucking fucking-  We talking about let's do a get the fuck out the cold over.  I'll still walk, but it's just stupid to broadcast it.  Just over, period.  It's so fucking cold.  Yeah, no, we're going to-  Look at your fucking Haralo's dumb face on the-  We're going to be parking the walkover in the very near future, so- 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  So you got to come out and check it out before we park.  All right, I don't know where you're going.  All right.  I'm crossing the fucking street.  Fucking okay, we get it.  Just let's go.  Let's discuss it inside, nigga.  Oh, enough with this fucking walk.  Oh.  What's the temperature today?  50 below my asshole.  Holy shit.  With a fucking wind chill factor of my dick in your head.  That didn't even make sense.  I don't know, but fuck that.  But that's cold.  It's too cold for me to even say this girl looks fine. 
[02:17:30]  It's got to be cold if you're not making any sense.  Oh, man.  With a slight chance of my ass on a porch.  What a guy's beeping.  He's got a wow sticker.  He's beeping.  He almost hit somebody.  He almost did a little rear end.  That would have been good.  It's even cold for white people.  He almost pulled a clippy tom.  What is she taking a picture of?  Oh.  It's just a building, man.  The fucking building, lady.  It's cold.  Get out of here.  Oh, okay. 
[02:18:00]  I've had it.  Oh.  What?  I'm bundled up like I'm climbing fucking Everest and I'm freezing.  It's 18 degrees.  Shit.  18 fucking degrees.  We also got a little wind chill happening today, though, too.  Yeah.  The real feel.  There's young Jeezy right there, by the way.  Which one?  Where is that?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Really fast.  Good for you.  All right.  Wow.  Continue.  You know, Cameron, it's too cold to give a shit about other cultures.  I don't think I'd care if it was 85.  Yeah, fuck other cultures right now. 
[02:18:30]  If it was 85 degrees, I wouldn't give a fuck about Jeezy.  If it was 100 degrees.  Young motherfucking Jeezy.  If it was 100 and he was bringing the drinks in the Caribbean, then maybe I'd care.  All right, everybody.  Thank you for joining us for the walk.  We're going inside.  And go fuck yourself.  I'm done.  Oh, warmth.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM 202.  O.P. and Anthony.  XM 202. 
[02:19:00]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  It creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. 
[02:19:30]  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:20:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  And we'll start with Dave from Long Island.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  That was the funniest walkover I think I've ever heard in my entire life.  Did you hear how miserable you guys were in that cold?  For a smile on my face.  It was really, really cold.  It's so cold, it's still cold.  If you know what I mean.  Because we're now indoors, but we still feel cold to the bone. 
[02:20:30]  It's 18 degrees in New York City, but there's a wind chill that's dropping that down to single digits, I believe, today.  Yeah, well, I fucking hope global warming comes sooner than I'm tired of waiting for it.  What was Patrice's line?  I don't know.  50 below my asshole.  50 below my asshole.  That's not the line of the day.  Well, we'll see what line of the day is a little later on.  No, that's got to be up there.  And we had a real clean show until Big Red showed up.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight dumps today. 
[02:21:00]  All Big Red.  And one in his pants.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't feel like talking about that today.  Stupid.  Ah, yes.  Let's go to John in Missouri.  John, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  How are you doing?  Good morning.  I really like listening to your show.  I just got my XM receiver lately.  Can I just ask you a quick question, if you don't mind?  You had a promotional thing you were running earlier this morning for one of your past shows this week. 
[02:21:30]  And Jim Norton was on there talking about punching little dogs in the stomach and stuff like that.  Do you remember that?  Yeah, it was hilarious.  Yeah, I mean, I don't mean to be a jerk and don't be mad at me, but I just thought that was a little distasteful that he'd say something like that.  I know you're trying to drive into a targeted audience on that from a broadcasting major myself.  Let me tell you something, sir.  That is why you're not hearing James Norton on the show today.  Yeah.  He got suspended for that exact thing. 
[02:22:00]  Patrice O'Neill is in today.  He was called in.  If you remember, Eric Logan was here yesterday, if you were listening yesterday, and they had a talk, a meeting after the show.  And Jimmy is suspended because we don't put up with that kind of talk.  I just kind of just, it made you feel a little hurt when you heard that, you know?  Yeah, I know what you mean, and so does the rest of the staff.  And you won't be hearing Jimmy on this show saying stuff like that.  I know you guys like animals a lot, so I didn't think it would, you know, so. 
[02:22:30]  But, all right, well, thanks, you guys.  You're doing a good job.  No problem.  Thank you.  John, I've got to ask you something.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Are you for real?  Please.  Yeah, of course I'm for real.  Broadcasting major here at UNKC in Missouri.  I just heard it on my XM receiver this morning.  And so I do a lot of volunteering at the local ASPCA.  And I just, I like animals a lot when I hear that.  You know, it kind of just makes your heart feel a little broken.  So, I mean, I guess I'm not your typical listener on the radio, but I do like listening to some 
[02:23:00]  of the stuff you guys say.  And most of it's really cool and funny and kind of gets you in the mood and all that.  But to hear something like that abusing animals is just sort of.  Kicking an animal, a doggie, in the stomach so hard that his asshole pops out.  You ever have a doggie?  That's what Jimmy was saying.  Yeah.  His little pink asshole pops out.  Was so distasteful that he had to be suspended for the week. 
[02:23:30]  John, let me teach you something about broadcasting because you're going down the wrong road.  Do you understand that that was so ridiculous that it was funny?  I just didn't think it was that funny.  Do you understand there was no real hate there?  The graphic description was so ridiculous.  That it makes it really funny to listen to.  That it makes it funny.  It's called dark comedy.  It's so ridiculous and out there and so, oh my God, that you feel compelled to be disgusted 
[02:24:00]  yet laugh at the same time.  And then you feel a little guilty because you're like in your car going, I can't believe I would  actually laugh at this.  But it's funny.  Hey, John, you're heading toward doing weather or farm reports for the rest of your life.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  Do farm reports because you like animals.  You don't really understand what an audience is looking for from a broadcaster.  You could talk about the cows that are going in to get the bolts shot through their head  and they get hacked up so we could have steak.  Well, I know you guys are trying to get a target audience. 
[02:24:30]  It's just that, John, here's the difference.  If we actually invited dogs in and had a kick the dog contest, then maybe you might be onto  something.  Yeah, but just talking about it.  But to realize, you got to realize how ridiculous, you got to realize how ridiculous Jimmy was  with his description of that.  No, we're not.  And that's what made it really funny.  We're not promoting cruelty to animals.  This is promoting cruelty to animals.  People, if you see a dog on the street, kick it if you enjoy the show.  There.  That's promoting. 
[02:25:00]  How can you say that?  XM ought to take notice of what you guys are saying.  You shouldn't say that on the radio like that.  I'm not buying this guy.  His acting is so bad.  What are you doing with your hands right now?  I bet they're dangling by your side.  I'm a college student in Kansas City.  I just happen to be listening to you guys.  That's all.  You're also a homosexual, aren't you?  A what?  A homosexual.  I can hear it in your voice.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I'm married.  I just got married last year.  Hey, Big Red, we got a cocksucker on the phone.  You want to talk to him?  Yeah, get him a mic.  Big Red, we'll talk to you. 
[02:25:30]  Why do you guys have to be so negative like this?  You already got kicked off the air once.  We're not negative, you fucking cunt.  Look at what you did in my Catholic church there.  We're in New York City.  Maybe that should happen again, you guys.  John.  John.  John.  He's just.  John.  John.  John.  Anthony and I have been at this a very long time.  You're acting.  You're acting.  You're trying to maybe come up with a character.  We're not buying into this.  You're didn't like the bit guy. 
[02:26:00]  This is more like morning zoo type stuff.  They would eat this shit up, but we could see right through it.  You're acting.  College students.  So why don't you at least admit you were trying to pull on over on us.  He just got married and he's in college.  I'm just a college student and full-time student in school.  I mean, I.  John.  I.  John.  We're going to hang up on you.  It's up to you.  Admit it.  We don't need you to do a good show today, but at least you can.  I just called to leave a comment with you guys.  That's all I can do, so.  Admit it. 
[02:26:30]  John.  John, be honest.  Admit what?  That this is a big thing, a goof, and you didn't really care about the dog thing.  It's not a goof.  I do care that you were talking about punching the little dogs in the stomach.  I think that's extremely mean.  Until their assholes popped out.  Come on.  Until their assholes popped out.  Right.  Their little tight pink little doggy assholes.  How can you be mean like that to a little dog?  John, are you a hairdresser?  No, I'm not.  I told you.  I'm a student in college.  John, we're not buying it.  Will you just let us off the hook now and go, all right, you got me? 
[02:27:00]  You got me.  Because we got to hang up.  Just say it.  Okay, I'm just telling you how I feel.  That's all.  It's no big deal.  Is that your final?  I mean, it is a big deal, but whatever.  Is that your final statement?  Because.  It'll have to live with your conscience.  That's all I can say.  God bless you guys.  Have a good day.  See you.  There's no way that's real, right?  Liar, liar, pants on fire, I say.  All right, let's go to Anthony in Connecticut.  Anthony.  Hey, guys, I'm a little disappointed you're not going to do the walkover, because I wanted  to see what it's going to be like when it snowed, seeing you guys throw snowballs at 
[02:27:30]  cabbies and stuff.  No, I shan't be walking in the cold like this.  Anthony, I got a question for you.  Did you see Christmas Vacation yet?  Because Opie's right.  That's one of the funniest movies of all time.  You have to see that.  Give us a review.  Yeah, you said you were going to see it, Ant.  I did.  I've been busy.  You have to see that movie, Ant.  All right.  I have no problem doing the walkover, because I think it would add to some silly conversations,  but we'll figure it out.  But I think it's going to end soon anyway.  How can you talk when you're just shivering? 
[02:28:00]  I don't know.  I wear long johns.  I'd prepare for the weather.  Isn't getting dressed in the morning just a big pain in the ass in the winter?  Isn't it so nice to throw a t-shirt on, jeans, and you're out the door?  Now it's layers and bundling up.  And then before you leave the studio, the jacket, the gloves, the hats, the...  What a pain in the ass.  You should move to Colorado.  Colorado's cold, too.  I mean, not Colorado.  Where did you want to go?  I would go to Arizona. 
[02:28:30]  That's right.  Arizona.  Maybe.  No, I think maybe I stay on the east coast.  Probably Florida.  I don't mind the heat.  What a...  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Hope.  You were talking...  You asked a question earlier.  Did a boycott ever work?  Yeah.  A little bus company down in Birmingham, Alabama.  Kind of worked out pretty well.  I was...  I was talking about that troublemaker.  No, no, no, no.  Whoa, whoa.  Patrice, stop right there.  The only reason...  Fuck you, nigga.  What I look like.  You just said...  You just said 19...  You just said boycott, motherfucker. 
[02:29:00]  That happens so that motherfucker's like, you can't say, whoa, whoa, hold up the trees.  We're talking about big companies.  The context is different, man.  Ease up.  I know.  I know.  All right.  We really are talking...  The only reason that they were allowed not to ride in the front of the bus was economic.  They were going to go out of business because they were being boycotted.  Yeah.  All right.  But I know your point.  It affects...  Now, we're talking more about like...  I know.  I'm busting.  Put it down.  All right.  Look at me trying to get serious with him.  Did you hear him?  Yeah.  A little...  A little bus company.  A little thing that happened in a little town called... 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Bless you.  Bless you.  Thank you.  All right.  Boy, Patrice is a sick motherfucker too, huh?  Yeah, because you were supposed to come in yesterday and you weren't ready, huh?  You look like you just watched Ghost.  You're all crying and shit.  Oh, it's just horrible.  And I got something in my left nostril that just won't...  Oh, it's tickling?  It won't dislodge or...  It's itching?  It's just making me even want to sneeze every five seconds. 
[02:30:00]  You should probably go to the bathroom and really blow your fucking schnoz.  Oh.  Before you start dripping.  I hate being sick, though.  You look miserable.  Being sick sucks.  Oh.  Hey, uh, this could be...  This could be kind of fun today.  We just got our latest packet from CBS.  We did the whole show on, uh...  We did it yesterday.  That...  The Words of Hate pamphlet or whatever it's called.  Being racially sensitive yesterday.  Today, we got...  They followed up today with...  Yeah, go ahead.  Sorry, yeah.  They got this FCC stuff. 
[02:30:30]  Policy Statement on Obscenity, Indecency, and Profanity.  This is handed out to everybody that works at CBS.  It is pretty thick.  And it is the same shit we have been given for years and years and years.  I've read the transcripts in here over and over again.  Are there any new ones?  I haven't seen one fucking new one in here.  And it's an insult.  It is an insult to be sent this to read these transcripts that were fined by the FCC to think 
[02:31:00]  that we don't know that this is not acceptable.  We always knew what to do on the radio.  We really did.  Because even the Sex for Sam thing was a legal broadcast.  Yes.  They had to actually come up with new rules to fine us because it was such an outrageous  and over-the-top thing we did.  But as far as a radio broadcast goes, we didn't break any rules.  We didn't break any of the current rules at the time.  No.  So the stupid lawyers in Washington, they send all their personalities examples of shows 
[02:31:30]  going too far and breaking FCC rules.  And like Anne said, we read the same examples five years ago.  They're insulting us by throwing this at us, thinking that we're actually going to learn  something from these examples.  Yeah.  You know?  But they're kind of fun to read through because it just shows you how ridiculous radio in general  has gotten.  When I first got this pamphlet years ago, I expected to read some really obscure gray 
[02:32:00]  area things where I'm like, wow, I'm glad I read that because I thought you could get  away with that.  Right.  There's that gray area, double entendre thing.  But these transcripts are so blatant that any idiot would know you cannot say this on the  air without getting fined if somebody wanted to turn you in.  Well, they're just justifying their big salaries and trying to show the company they work  for, which is CBS Radio, that they're doing something behind the scenes. 
[02:32:30]  Yep.  Like this first example, let's see.  All right.  Following segment discussing adult film actor Ron Jeremy, which the FCC determined to include  graphic and explicit references to sexual activity.  No shit.  Who wants to do the female voice?  What page?  What page are we on?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Page four.  Sorry about that.  Page four. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Well, we don't need to talk about, because they explain what's indecent.  Yeah.  We don't need to explain that to people.  They'll be bored to death.  Oh, page four of the actual...  With this lawyer jargon.  ...transcript thing?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there it is.  Well, I see four...  What?  You got to go to page...  Another page four.  There's another page four.  There's four pages of explaining, you know, the rules of the FCC, which are so fucking  boring to read through.  I can't even tell you.  Okay.  You want to start with female voice?  Yeah. 
[02:33:30]  So the female voice goes, I masturbate with Jeremy's video every day.  Not every day, but every other weekend.  So there is a conversation going on on the air.  So the female says that.  And then whoever the fuck Craig is says, wow, what is that you like about him so much?  And then the female goes, the way he licks pussy.  The way he licks pussy.  Now, to enjoy this segment, remember what Anthony said.  We're thinking by these examples, we're going to get some gray area stuff. 
[02:34:00]  Gray area, like saying...  But this is so over the top and obvious that you can't say this.  Like saying, wow, dude, come on, don't be a pussy.  Just do it.  That is using pussy in the proper context.  And even in some situations, they don't let you do that.  Right.  You could say, I have a pussy cat, but you can't do it in a way that is so obvious you're  talking about a girl's twat, even though you're using double entendre.  But you can't say, the tip of my dick hurts. 
[02:34:30]  No.  You can't say that.  Of course not.  No.  But you could say, you know, don't be a dick about this.  All right.  You know, they allow you a certain latitude with the words.  But you can't say, the way he licks pussy.  Yeah.  She continues, the way he licks pussy.  I want to do a threesome with him.  See who's the best.  If I can lick better or he can lick better.  Bam.  $27,500.  $27,500.  $27,500.  For each of nine broadcasts. 
[02:35:00]  Each of nine broadcasts.  Or re-broadcasts of the following.  So it was nine times $27,500.  By the way, that would now cost you $275,000 times nine.  Mm-hmm.  So you can't say, I haven't had enough vegetables lately, so my shit is coming out like boxing  gloves.  Right.  Boxing gloves.  Ow.  My shit is clunky.  No.  How about, I'm fucking a girl and her pussy stinks horribly. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Can you say that?  I don't think you can.  Why would I even put that?  I was like, that's so weird.  And I was like.  You could say, don't be a pussy.  Fuck that stinky cunt.  You can say that.  Yeah.  Okay, good.  Brother.  Lots of fines.  Which one do you want to go to next?  You can't say, I like to etch a sketch of my girl by coming in her face and when she 
[02:36:00]  complains, I just try to shake it off.  Yeah.  You can't say that.  All right, let's see.  A lot of unintelligible in that, but I guess it was good enough.  That's about shaving.  Then there's, why did they find that one?  Which one?  Two female high school students.  Where's that one?  Called Elliot.  Where's that one?  Page six. 
[02:36:30]  Okay.  The opportunity to audition to dance in a cage at a rock music concert.  During an on-air interview, the students were asked provocative sexual related questions.  As a consequence of the interview, the students were suspended from their high school the following  day, which prompted the show to conduct on-air discussion that same day, which repeated  references to the students' sexual activities and which included telephone calls with several  other high school students, the FCC concluded, two broadcasts targeted the very segment of  the population, the children, including teens under 18 whom the government had recognized 
[02:37:00]  and compelled interest to shield from indecent material.  So that's where you better watch your ass what you say to people under age.  What's a forfeiture notice?  I don't know.  It's all lawyer shit.  That's where you are obligated, not obligated, but yeah, yeah, obligated to pay that fine.  You must forfeit $55,000.  Out of whose pocket?  The station. 
[02:37:30]  The company.  The company that owns the station.  When was the last time you guys got fined?  Nah, we got fined for the sex with Sam thing.  Wasn't really a fine.  Yeah, true.  It was part of a settlement.  Settlement.  It was a lot, though.  It was so they can, you know, conduct business.  We made the top five.  We made the top five.  I don't know, it was like a half a million or something.  You've never lined like four or five guys up against a locker, have you?  No, not four or five.  One or two?  Two or three.  Let me ask you, you better looking than Lauren? 
[02:38:00]  And Bridget says, I don't know.  I think we're both pretty hot.  Right.  Have you ever hooked up?  And Bridget says, no, but we've been known to do our little show at parties and whatnot.  What do you mean, your little show?  Like we dance together, you know.  Like with your boobies out?  And that's why they got fined.  I think this is a scene from the OC.  Yeah.  On the latest OC.  It's because he's talking to, like, teenage girls, underage, and said, like, with your boobies out. 
[02:38:30]  That's what got him fined.  I want to get to the really good ones.  We should do it during the breaks instead of searching and searching for it here on the air live.  Because there are some really, really good ones.  Yeah.  Are you guys in there somewhere?  Blatant.  I don't think we're in here, are we?  I don't think so.  Maybe.  I'm not reading through all this shit.  And then we have to sign a paper to say we read this?  We got in trouble once because of a remix that was put together by Drew Boogie.  We had nothing to do with it.  It was some girl, and she was talking to Jim Cook from Sam Adams about beer. 
[02:39:00]  And talking about the nice, creamy head on the beer.  And how she wants to put it in her mouth.  Stick a long neck in my mouth.  A long neck bottle.  It was very, very close to the edge.  But when it was taken completely out of context and just cut into a song,  it sounded like she wanted to suck her father's cock.  We got so screwed.  And we really kind of got in trouble for that one there. 
[02:39:30]  He took out all the Jim Cook stuff that kind of made it sound loosely that they were talking about beer.  Yeah.  And then it was just beyond explicit.  Yeah.  They got really, really mad at us on that one.  I think we got fined for $37,000 on that one.  How about this quickie?  The FCC found actionable indecency a brief joke delivered on air by an in-studio guest from MTV's show Jackass.  The FCC was not persuaded by the license claim that the host was unaware of the joke's sexual import and noted that in any event, a license is responsible for the programming of the station. 
[02:40:00]  So the guest said this.  But it doesn't matter if a guest says it.  You're still responsible.  Boy, this one sure hits the gray area.  Guest, I've got a joke.  What do you do when you stick a butcher knife up a baby's ass?  Host, I don't know. 
[02:40:30]  What do you get?  A mean hard-on.  I would have thought that would have skated right through.  Yeah, I thought that was in the gray area.  That sounds like dummies.  All right, enough.  Who gives a shit?  We'll get some better.  Maybe someone can go through that and highlight the really over-the-top ones.  Her box had some cheese, so I nicknamed her Swiss.  Her box.  Smell my finger.  Smell my finger. 
[02:41:00]  Come on.  Smell that stank finger.  You can't say that.  Stop it.  I mean, you can on XM, obviously.  All right, here's an interesting story about what's going on with the good old war there.  And you're not going to believe what they're using.  And what they need us to donate to the troops in Iraq.  Right. 
[02:41:30]  In New Jersey, a woman says that you can help the troops in Iraq by donating Silly String.  Well, it turns out the soldiers actually use Silly String to detect wires that may be connected to explosive booby traps.  And it sprays up to 12 feet of a foam-like substance.  Silly String, of course, formations and cash are being collected.  St. Luke's on Warwick Road in Stratford, New Jersey.  That's interesting.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Listen, we know what.  If it helps them.  Easy to find and not expensive.  Yeah.  And certainly worthy when you consider it could save the lives. 
[02:42:00]  No doubt.  Coming right back.  Can someone explain that?  What?  Silly String?  I guess Silly String, yeah, being used for what?  Crime fighting?  What was that?  I don't know what the Silly String's being used for.  Wait a minute.  I've got to hear the first part again.  Silly String, they're spraying it on what?  Mines or something?  In New Jersey, a woman says that you can help the troops in Iraq by donating Silly String. 
[02:42:30]  Well, it turns out the soldiers actually use Silly String to detect wires that may be connected to explosive booby traps.  And it sprays up to 12 feet of a foam-like substance.  Silly String, coarse donations, and cash are being collected at St. Luke's on Warwick Road in Stratford, New Jersey.  That's interesting.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  Listen, we know what.  If it helps them.  Easy to find and not expensive.  It's certainly worthy when you consider it could save the lives.  No doubt.  Coming right back.  I guess the trip wires that are laid out, the Silly String hits it. 
[02:43:00]  It's too light to detonate it.  But you can see that it's over something, the string, the Silly String.  You could see like it's laying over a wire instead of walking and tripping over the trip wire and setting off a bomb.  You spray the Silly String in front of you.  And when you see that it's over a trip wire, you know not to step on it.  Oh, wow.  Silly String.  That's silly. 
[02:43:30]  For one can of Silly String, you can walk what?  20 feet?  You better have a few cans with that.  You're going to look ridiculous out there.  A whole backpack full of Silly String?  Silly String.  I got another FCC thing.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  It's a case involving a live broadcast of a major rap concert.  The FCC rejected the licensee's position that, get this, the cultural significance of the concert precluded the FCC from drawing a distinction between the concert and material beliefs may be of greater artistic merit. 
[02:44:00]  So they actually, the station was trying to say, because they have a cultural significance, they're black.  Yeah.  That should exclude them from paying a fine because this is art that the FCC probably doesn't understand.  Here's what went out over the air.  The GM was fired immediately.  This was a CBS GM. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  I remember this story.  Go ahead.  God damn, where are my pussy-eating niggers?  Any of my niggers into eating pussy?  Y'all make some noise.  Hey, where are my girls?  If you're eating pussy, where you at?  That's it.  Oh, they all like it.  I ain't eating no pussy tonight.  If y'all don't like it, fuck it.  I ain't gonna beg you.  You like it?  Where's the problem? 
[02:45:00]  And then we're trying to say, look, excuse me, these are black gentlemen, and this is a whole cultural thing.  This is somebody talking to the community.  And this is art.  So could you, okay, get my checkbook.  I'll just write that.  Actually, what they're trying to say, you can see the lawyers behind the scenes, what they're really discussing there is the potential merger between XM Satellite Radio and Sirius.  What pussy means is...  Oh, my God, there's another one.  But really fast, how stupid are you if you're, like, the GM or whatever of a hip-hop station, and you decide that it's okay to broadcast a live hip-hop show? 
[02:45:30]  Live hip-hop show.  You gotta be insane to think that would fly with the FCC.  That's, yeah, that's insanity.  Well, this, too.  This is during a time when silly radio people thought that just because you had a sex therapist on, you could discuss sex.  That didn't work.  Sex therapist. 
[02:46:00]  She should go up and down the shaft about five times, licking and sucking, and on the fifth, swirl her tongue around the head before going back down.  And then the show host, show us how it's done.  Evidently, the guest had some sort of prop.  Yeah.  Well, if it was a real penis, it would have a, and then it says blank ridge, I guess a head ridge or dick ridge. 
[02:46:30]  I would lick around the ridge like this laughter and comments such as, oh, yeah, babe.  They put that in parentheses.  What a dope.  And they got, fine.  You can't do that on regular radio.  Let's say hi to Fatty in Oceanside.  Fatty.  Hey, Fatty.  What up?  Yeah, I can't say what field of work I'm in, but my job title is the same as Brian Cashman's. 
[02:47:00]  I was wondering if you'd do me a favor and tell me the end of the story where the girls, if the girls danced with their boobies out.  Yeah, I think they would dance with their boobies out.  Stupid FCC.  They give that example and they take the hotness out of it.  Come on.  The question is, do you dance with your boobs out?  And we don't get the answer.  The high school girls.  The lawyers, the buzzkillers, they decide, all right, enough.  Off of the example, you don't need the answer at this point.  Yes, we do.  We need the answer. 
[02:47:30]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Lot16.com.  That's right.  All right.  Very good.  Yeah.  So when we see these, we get infuriated.  Oops.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  What happened?  You got another good one?  Yeah.  I'll skip the old.  You got this one in?  I meant 12.  Oh, page 12.  Oh, you silly.  Here's another one that got a radio station fined.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm good.  Two fingers on each side. 
[02:48:00]  Wow.  Oh, wait.  We should play the parts here.  Okay.  All right.  I'll be MC.  Yeah, I'm good.  Two fingers on each side.  Wow.  With both hands.  Yeah.  You got two fingers from each hand.  Right.  On both sides.  Give it the old stroke.  Uh-huh.  And what kind of lubrication?  Oh, I won't be explicit.  Okay, go for it.  Uh, uh, well, I, uh, I eat my ejaculate.  Really? 
[02:48:30]  You fuckers.  Yeah.  That's kind of gross.  Have you heard of any other guys doing that?  Well, what I've heard is, you know, after having sex with a girl on, with a girl on, you know, straight intercourse, uh, what I've heard of guys like then, you know, having oral sex with the girl without cleaning first.  I mean, I never thought that was, uh, particularly weird.  I just think that, you know, as an appetizer or some, uh, something to actually be nutritioning. 
[02:49:00]  What?  This woman should be fined for her fucking grammar.  No kidding.  I don't know if it really works.  I mean, it's pure protein from what I understand.  Ah.  Eating your own ejaculate.  Yeah, that could be a no-no.  But someone has to be told you can't say that on regular radio.  Gotta be told.  This shit the lawyers said to us is just amazing.  I'm still laughing at, God, yo, where are my pussy eating niggas at? 
[02:49:30]  Yo.  Put my pussy eating niggas.  I ain't pussy.  Who's eating pussy?  Yo, make some noise.  Yo.  Yeah.  Yo, where are my girls at that's eating pussy?  Where y'all at?  That's it?  Aw, nigga, fuck y'all, nigga.  I ain't no pussy tonight.  I'm just laughing at you reading that and just going over it like, you know, goddamn it.  Then there's the bleeping problem that they went through. 
[02:50:00]  A lot of people were just bleeping.  Oh, they got upset with that?  Yeah, like you have to bleep the whole word.  It used to be you could take the word, split it in half, and put a bleep in the middle.  Right.  So it was like, fuck bleep.  You know, you get like, shit bleeped.  Yeah, there it is.  It was like, don't give me your fucking shit. 
[02:50:30]  And I said shit.  What an asshole.  You're in an asshole.  But that's what they would do.  Right.  You're a fucking idiot.  And apparently they had somebody say, douchebag, hey, what's up, fuck head?  What is your fuck hoe?  Yeah, that's what happened.  You his fuck hoe?  What?  You his fuck bitch man? 
[02:51:00]  Where you suck his dick every night?  Suck some dick.  Make some money.  That's how.  Yeah.  But you said fuck though.  Yeah.  They said they missed some words completely.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Like just missed some words completely.  Like suck, boop, my dick.  Suck my dick.  You fucking.  That's what they would do.  So you were fucking him? 
[02:51:30]  You were fucking him last night.  You're a fucking cunt rag.  We got any other examples?  That's the only copy.  Huh?  Oh, that's the only copy?  Yeah, go through.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We got some Mark David Chapman audio talking about how he, you know, how he shot Lennon  and all that crap.  I see this Tyra Banks thing with my name on it.  What is going on there?  Oh, you got like cut out of the whole show, but.  Oh, they just banned you.  Oh, dude.  Oh, my God.  They cut my mic off and everything, dude.  They cut you out of that show. 
[02:52:00]  Made some white girl fucking cry in that show.  There's not much here, but you were on Tyra Banks' show.  We love Tyra.  We can't get enough of Tyra.  Yeah.  They threw me right out of there.  By that, we mean we can't stand her.  But she makes for great radio because she makes everything about herself.  Oh, Jesus.  She's sexy, though.  Self-centered.  She's beyond sexy.  She's like fucking.  Who can deny that?  She's flawless.  Who's going to deny that?  But she needs a lot of attention, though.  I'd go straight for the asshole.  Straight for it.  Really?  Like, the dirtiest place on her body.  I'd go for it.  Fuck pussy and just, man. 
[02:52:30]  You'd lick her asshole?  I would lick her.  Would you fuck her?  Be careful how you say it, Patrice.  Oh, hike it right up.  Yeah?  And then what?  And just sit there and I would rub my chin.  Yeah.  You know, back and forth as if I was studying it.  And then I would just go right in.  Where?  To the asshole.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Right in that asshole.  Right in the asshole.  Yeah.  And then work my way to the pussy.  And then would you fuck her?  I would fuck her. 
[02:53:00]  I don't know if I would.  I'm not into asshole fucking.  Right.  Oh, two.  Two beefsmen.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I'm not into asshole fucking.  No?  But asshole licking is almost dirtier.  And the tyros is just, you know.  And right after she had a hard day's work, I'd lick her asshole.  So her whole pussy area would be wet with a lot of sweat?  I would hope so.  I would hope that it would be dripping with pussy juice.  Yeah.  And, you know, and just taste like, you know, just like no other pussy I've ever done before. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  What about her asshole, though?  What if there's shit back there?  Dude, I would hope.  I would lick her asshole.  Yeah.  I don't care if another guy had licked her asshole and fucked her in her pussy and came in her asshole and her eyeball.  And I don't care if she sucks seven dicks.  As.  Oh.  I thought you said ass.  No.  As.  I don't care how many guys had fucked her in her asshole before I had got to lick it. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  I would go straight for Tyra Banks' asshole.  Right.  And then pussy.  Okay.  I hope the people out there got that.  Then I would fuck her between her tits.  Yeah.  And I would try to shoot a hot load right in her asshole-y puss hole.  Well, we kept it clean for regular age. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Well, you might as well.  That's what some of these dopes try to do.  Grab that tape and we'll play it tomorrow on CBS.  So, Patrice, this could be funny, actually.  Did you see your appearance on the Tyra show?  Mine?  Yeah.  No.  All right.  So, why don't you explain?  You went on Tyra's show to do, like, kind of a web junk thing, like a video, a viral video  contest you was doing?  I was just disruptive.  And they just, I don't know what happened.  You were on the whole hour.  I just sat, yeah, I was somewhere there.  And how much did you talk during the hour?  I think I said a couple of things, but by the end of the show, they figured out a way 
[02:55:00]  to not have me say anything.  Oh, they just edited all your shit out.  We usually edit down clips.  We have your appearance on Tyra's show.  The whole thing?  Yeah.  It adds up to just over a minute of our time.  Oh, that's awful.  This girl cried.  They had to stop.  It was just like the DJ going, rawr.  I said, give it up for fat white girls everywhere or something.  I don't remember what I said, but she started bawling.  They had to stop the show.  I was digging in the popcorn bag.  They gave us popcorn.  I was just squishing it while everybody was talking. 
[02:55:30]  It was just like, it just took me back to high school.  Why did you make someone cry?  Oh, is that good?  She was going to cry anyway.  She was like, yeah.  You said, what the hell is that?  So we're on the verge.  Yeah.  I'm like, you know, growing up, it just reminded me like, there's no, I'm praying one day I  could just have a show that just focuses on destroying that kind of fun.  Yeah.  That, come on, girls, that girl power shit, that shit's fucking sick.  Yeah, because you're beautiful, girls, no matter what you.  That shit was in the background growing up, man.  Guys would destroy it. 
[02:56:00]  We would take, you got to have a quiet meeting in the back, bitches, and have your fucking  empowerment.  You can't be on TV having a motherfucker.  In front of people and expect us to put up with that shit.  Yeah, suck my dick with that bullshit.  Suck my dick, bitch.  I don't know if I can fuck you, your asshole, and pussy.  That shit is corny.  They gave us popcorn and we were supposed to sit there and comment on these dumb videos  because all of a sudden I was the web junk guy and I was like, I got to get out of this. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, I got to get out of it.  She just cried her little dumb eyes out.  You got your appearance.  Here it is.  It starts with this.  Our third and final judge is the star of VH1 and iFilm's web junk 20.  Comedian, Patrice O'Neil.  Good to see you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  So, Patrice, tell us about web junk.  It's just a goofy show.  It talks mostly about Japanese videos.  I talk about that and I make fun of it. 
[02:57:00]  That's what the show is.  Okay.  So does web junk mean a good thing or a bad thing?  It means a bad, I think it means, I don't know.  It's so bad it's good.  Yeah.  It's so bad it's good.  All right.  That's like top model sometimes.  So that was a-  So she brought it back to herself also.  Brought it right back to her show.  Always brings it back to herself.  That was 38 seconds.  And I was watching the countdown.  You talked for less than half of that 30 seconds.  So let's give it, we'll give you 18 seconds.  They cut me, you don't understand how much they had to do. 
[02:57:30]  Right.  I think they filmed a different show with one of those, with the judge.  I think they made one of those kids because he's like some, he hosts a G4 show.  He was actually pretty cool.  I liked him.  But he was like, he's so, you know how you meet somebody that could be cool, but he's  just such a fucking schmuck, like he just won't say fuck the system ever.  He drank the Kool-Aid.  Yeah.  He just won't do it.  And he just, he was, he said all the right things. 
[02:58:00]  And even in the break, he said to me, because I talked about this fat girl, he goes, my mom  is fat.  I said, where do you think I come from, motherfucker?  Two midgets, you fucking idiot.  My mom is fat.  My mother would laugh in fat jokes.  My mother always laughs and shit like that.  Right.  And he's all just extra corporate, but I actually liked him because he had that evil shit.  And that's motherfuckers that get on my nerves.  He was at, you know, he had a little evil in him, but, uh, I was, I mean, I know how  to destroy women fun and they gave us popcorn, right?  And in bags to watch the films. 
[02:58:30]  So anytime somebody would talk, I would just get the popcorn and they'd be like, well, I,  it took me a long time to figure out how to, and everybody's looking like this guy's  a dick, right?  And so she says, Patrice, what do you think?  I go, you know what?  Cause the girl's like, I used to be fat.  It's one of those things where she was, she would blink on a roof and then say, I used  to be, and then blink on a, on a field somewhere. 
[02:59:00]  And then fat, but boom.  And then she was on the moon.  I used to be fat, but now I love myself.  And I go, they go, Patrice, what do you think?  I go, you know what?  I say you, it's courageous for any fat white woman to be on TV announcing that she's fat.  Give it up for fat white women.  Give it up for this pig.  Oh shit.  And she just started crying.  And I go, what?  She said she was fat.  Oh shit.  And why did the audience just turn on you?  Just turn, but you know who was laughing?  All the black women in the audience. 
[02:59:30]  Cause you know why?  Cause fat is a white girl's phenomenon.  They just don't know how to be fat.  And she wasn't even that fat.  She was like a size 10 or a size eight.  And she's like, I'm so fat.  And all the black women were like, I'm so happy.  That black woman don't care.  They're like, I look good.  Exactly.  They were like, that fat bitch.  And Ty was just like, and then Ty started doing the whole, you go girl.  You did the do.  And I said, what the fuck?  And then the warmup guy, what's that nigga name?  He's like, you know, oh, he says, he says, we don't like to point out any different creeds 
[03:00:00]  or color or a thing like that.  I said, I go like this.  I go, oh really, nigga?  I really was just really disruptive and unruly on this show.  Well, let's get back to the tape.  So just sabotage your entire appearance.  We got more Patrice on Tyra.  The first clip you talked maybe 18 seconds.  Let's, let's call it.  Here's the second Patrice clip from Tyra's show. 
[03:00:30]  And then that brings us to Ginger, who we spoke about before.  And I don't know, Patrice, what'd you think?  You thought courageous?  Oh, courageous.  Brooke?  Courageous.  And you lost Wade.  That was good.  I think, I think, I think we have to hand it to Ginger.  I think she cleared it.  This was, that was, the reason they did that, that was, that's courageous for sarcasm.  Yeah.  Cause, what do you think, Patrice?  Courageous.  Courageous.  Cause everybody kept saying how courageous this fat bitch was. 
[03:01:00]  Courageous for what?  What's, what, courage?  So I would, I stood up and go, give it up for this fat white girl.  She's courageous.  And they were just like, what the fuck is going on?  So they asked me again, I said, courageous.  Courageous.  It was courageous.  Oh, they, they hustled me out of there.  You've never seen anybody get hustled out of a place that fast.  That was two seconds.  Dude.  Two seconds.  And you sat there for an hour and I'm sure you gave her some good stuff.  That's the sad part, but.  But that's like Ellen cut me out.  They had a, I had a good conversation with Ellen on her show.  Uh, she came out and, uh, I said, Ellen, you got a great, um, you got a great, uh, room 
[03:01:30]  or whatever.  Your guest room is great.  It's the best guest room I've ever been in.  You know, great fucking stuff in the refrigerator and pretty good.  She goes, I said, but you got the, the second best gift basket, right?  And she goes, well, who was the first?  I said, DL Hewley had the best gift basket.  I've ever seen in a, in a show.  She goes, what was it?  And I said, wine, cigars.  It was fantastic.  And then she goes, well, maybe he should have used all his, some of his money on his 
[03:02:00]  show instead of his gift basket.  And I said, wow, that was a good one, Ellen.  I didn't expect that from you.  And they cut that all out.  They cut it all out because of the nature of these, these fucking bitches that come  on girl and do the dance and all that fucking girl power shit.  And girls don't even know how to really have fun.  They're really useless at it.  It's like, what the, go girl.  Women are supposed to be watching men have fun and be jealous.  That's what their job is.  And finally, this clip from Tyra.  Preach on Tyra. 
[03:02:30]  It's the one that the judges like best, but it's not over yet.  Unfortunately, Ginger, it's very like American idols because the final vote is in your hands.  All you have to do is log on to TyraShow.com and you can see all five videos again.  I want to remind you of what the prizes are again.  The winner will get the opportunity to submit ideas for consideration for the Tyra Show's  promo campaign for next season.  And I'm involved in those meetings and stuff too.  So I'd be hearing those ideas and possibly taking them into consideration.  Do you understand why I have to be disruptive?  And the next is you get to shoot a video of me. 
[03:03:00]  Whatever you want to do, we'll figure it out and we'll post it on the website and do all  kind of fun things with it.  And so it'll be good.  We'll be right back.  Oh God, it is all about her.  It is all about her.  Can you picture?  Can you just understand?  I guarantee you.  I couldn't imagine you sitting there through that drivel.  But I guarantee he gave some great stuff.  They ended up cutting your appearance down at 20 seconds.  They just would not have you.  You can see the scramble going on. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  And I think they cut my mic off too.  I had a lapel mic.  And they cut that, they just was nothing, no talking for you.  No part of you.  God forbid you brought some funny.  God forbid.  Everything has to be serious.  I had to disrupt that stupid show.  And what are they doing now?  Like you get to the film Tyra?  Film Tyra.  Are they doing like a green screen or something?  I don't know.  And they had a band on, by the way, I remember that show.  They had a band on who never met.  I think it was a YouTube band. 
[03:04:00]  And they never met.  Like they used to, they did music on YouTube and they didn't know each other.  Really?  Whatever that means.  And so they got together the first time on that show.  Like, but before they were just like, I'm a guitarist.  Yeah, they would play.  I've seen these virtual bands.  Yeah.  And then they got together.  That was what they, it was all internet stuff.  It was all.  Did they suck?  Of course they did.  Some guy that was, you know, he, he, he was a frustrated guy that thought it was too 
[03:04:30]  good to be there.  Yeah.  But this is what he's been boiled down to.  Cause he's a guy like me who I'm trying to straighten that out.  But this anti-system motherfucker.  And you can just say, you know, you're not even good enough to be anti-system fuck face.  It's just like being happy with your whole shit.  I can barely listen to what you're saying.  Are you all right?  I think I'm dying.  Your eyes, there is water pouring out of your eyes and you're like, and you got a massive  runny nose.  You look like a basset hound. 
[03:05:00]  I really, what happened between all the show and this show?  I caught it, I brought it back on.  There is water pouring out of your eyes.  I'm just trying to be a trooper.  You really are.  And I really.  You're losing the battle.  I know.  I feel your pain.  I just, I'm just over medicated.  I got a different cold in you.  My shit is here somewhere.  You got sinus.  Did you take anything for it?  I'm, I'm drinking diabetic tussin. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  As if it's, as if it's apple juice.  I'm diabetic tussin.  Well, it's coming out of your eyeballs.  And that useless airborne, that airborne can suck my dick.  That stuff stinks.  Take it before you get sick.  How, how the fuck, what, what side of that?  What the fuck are you talking about?  Take it before what?  Take, take it before I'm ill?  You have to guess.  I have to guess when I'm going to get sick, you hunk of shit.  That is so right.  You have to guess like, all right, well.  Get out of my face.  You know what?  I haven't been, I haven't had a cold. 
[03:06:00]  You know what?  I'm going to start taking it today.  Yeah.  I think tomorrow or next week or sometime I might get sick.  It's like Alka-Salsa candy.  Dude.  That's what it is.  It's candy Alka-Salsa.  It tastes like Jell-O and it's tasty.  Dude, the people that came up with that are brilliant though, man.  Brilliant.  Because of the little kids thing, they have spoils.  It's nothing but a vitamin C tablet.  Yeah.  And it just doesn't, I mean, my immune system is not bad.  You know what I'm saying?  I usually like to not take anything, but I'm working.  I got to do shows.  I got to come to the radio. 
[03:06:30]  I'm trying, so I'm like gulping.  I ain't going to the tonight show.  Oh, God.  There's nothing worse than last night.  I'm sitting there sniffling and any joke I did, it was a slight bit of snot would fly  out and people in the front, sometimes I'll spit a little bit on something fly out and  they just, they just won't move.  And I just go, I said, did that hit you?  I go, look at you just sitting there letting me spit all over you.  Just wipe it off.  Wipe it off.  And so I'm fucking like wiping, you know what I'm like?  Sam Jackson in Kiss of Death. 
[03:07:00]  You ever see that movie when he got shot in the face and he just had a thing where he's  wiping his eye for the whole movie.  He just got a runny eye.  So I'm just sitting there with a runny nose and an eye and I'm trying, you know, I'm a  soldier.  Hold on.  Back to the answer to feedback.  Michael from Brooklyn writes, you guys worked, you guys passed over that way too quickly.  Here's the deal.  Tyra's having a contest where first prize is that you get to take video of Tyra.  Yeah.  A whole contest and if you win, you get to videotape Tyra. 
[03:07:30]  That's the first prize.  It's all about her, man.  What a self-centered scene.  I think I can get Tyra.  Huh?  Yeah.  I think I can get her.  Really?  Yeah.  You have to just, you have to just take her up to an emotional level of just dismiss her  and be arrogant.  Like if she's talking, walk us through how you get Tyra.  You have to get her, you have to get her to be emotional because she's about as dumb as  a, as a, as a unlit candle.  So it's like, if you just, if you dismiss Tyra, she's the type of girl that is, she thinks  she has something to say and, and, and she has emotions and it just goes straight for 
[03:08:00]  her mind.  But she doesn't have a plan to, you know, I'll plan B.  So all you got to do, like when she's talking, you just go, if you shush Tyra, she will get  livid.  And if she keeps screaming, you just go, you just, Tyra, just keep going.  Yeah.  You just go, Tyra, you're not saying anything you never have.  And you know it.  You're just an idiot.  Listen, let me talk.  Let me, let me, let me run this for you.  And she was screaming, getting mad.  And all you got to do is take that passion of the hatred.  It's easy to take passion, hate women's hate and turn it right into love. 
[03:08:30]  I'm telling you, because an emotion is an emotion for a girl.  I'm telling you, I can get time.  As long as it's strong.  The emotion is strong.  I believe you're serious about it.  I tell my girl all the time.  Don't you ever let a fucking guy get you mad because that means you have passion to spare.  That means you got some, you got passion that you could be using with me to spare.  You don't, you don't fucking let some guy say something to you. 
[03:09:00]  That means that I'm not giving you enough, you know, enough emotional fucking shit to feed  on and she has no emotion.  No one says anything to her that challenges her.  She's an idiot.  If she called in, I would say, Tyra, you know, let's be honest.  You are a fucking idiot.  And she would scream and she would be emotional.  And I would laugh at her because she really wouldn't have any logic behind her emotions.  No.  I'd be like, Tyra, look, sweetie.  If you was a fat, ugly girl, you wouldn't exist.  You know? 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  And you're lucky that for some reason modeling has made tall, goofy, big head girls like you  to be pretty.  I'm not going for it.  There's this African model.  Wow, you're good.  She's the worst looking person I've ever seen in my life.  She's a little short hair, crispy little mess.  And I'm like, I refuse to let you tell me that this bitch is a model.  Tyra in high school got teased.  Her head is big.  She's tall.  She's not needed.  She's probably skinny, skinny.  Somebody decided that a girl like that is cute. 
[03:10:00]  But Tyra was a big, long-headed idiot in high school.  And now her whole life has been pampered.  Naomi Campbell's another one.  She's got beluga, whale, forehead.  Idiot.  Just dismiss her.  Dismiss her existence because it's never been dismissed.  It's that simple.  I like that.  Wow.  I'll get her.  You know what the hell?  You want to continue with Tyra then?  Goddamn.  He's got a great point though about that whole thing.  I'm telling you, dude.  She has no options in her life.  Oprah would be harder to get because Oprah had to have options. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah.  She had to work through her fatness.  Yeah.  She had to have plan B's in her life.  She had to have plan B, C, and D.  Yes.  And no bullshit.  But Tyra.  Tyra all about her looks.  Yep.  And she is, dude, she is legitimately amazing looking.  Yeah.  Like you stand next to her, man.  She's about six foot tall and she's gained a little weight.  So she just got all the meat in the right place and these sexy dress.  These wear, I mean, fat ass.  I would just, oh. 
[03:11:00]  Really going out on a limb there.  Oh, I'm picturing what I would.  But I'm not saying, nah, just fuck her.  You know, I would rap as shit.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  I'd lick her underarms.  I'd do something creepy.  It's the only creepy place you're going to do.  Lick her underarms.  Come here.  Let me lick the corner of your nose between your cheek and your...  Mmm, let me lick.  Mmm, yeah.  Smell underarms.  Behind the ear where the ear meets the skull.  Oh, the skull.  Come on, let me lick that meat where your ear.  Just all kind of creepy places. 
[03:11:30]  Give me those elbows.  Give me those rough elbows.  Give me those rough elbows.  Oh, no, no, no, don't lotion them.  Don't lotion them.  Don't lotion them.  Don't lotion them.  Mm-mm.  I like it.  I like it all cracky.  Yeah, man.  Oh, she's...  Woof.  Tyra, well, she did a show recently called Tyra Helps Sick Kids.  What's great about this, Sam, one of Sam's jobs is to just watch Tyra every day and  get clips of her making it about herself.  Right?  Right there, Sam?  Yeah.  And she always turns around no matter what the topic is and makes it about herself somehow, 
[03:12:00]  some way.  So she does a show on sick kids and this first clip, Tyra has good advice for a girl being  picked on for having cancer because Tyra was a cruel kid and was picked on.  Yeah.  Of course.  Excuse me.  I think having a big fat forehead in school and having cancer are very similar.  Ah, she can relate?  Yeah.  You just don't know. 
[03:12:30]  What a self-centered ass.  Once again, Tyra has good advice for a girl being picked on for having cancer because  Tyra was a cruel kid and was picked on.  How bad was Sam picked on being this crispy niggery...  Black, white guy.  You was picked on bad in high school, right?  Yeah, but I'm...  Come on, Coon.  Say it.  Cool.  I've had a good sense of humor.  I can dish it back.  Dish it...  Yes.  I can dish it back.  We got him to talk like that.  With a deep voice yesterday.  You want to hear it?  Go ahead.  Yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Go ahead.  What should I say?  Oh, my God.  You know, something about your camera.  Oh, my God.  Or Tyra.  Oh, man.  Tyra.  Come on, fucking soul man.  This next clip from Tyra.  What about...  I ran out of air already.  I don't know what to say.  Damn.  You just need a hair transplant.  He's got...  It's that...  We're getting you a straightener for Christmas.  Yeah, do something to this. 
[03:13:30]  Come on, Afro eyes.  Look at this motherfucker.  The makeover's almost complete.  If he just thinned out his eyebrows a little bit.  Thin them out and do something with that hair.  That fucking nappy...  Whatever hair it is.  I like my hair.  Oh, my God.  That's how they wear it in Wisconsin.  That's where you're from, right?  No, I'm from New York.  You're from New York?  Yes.  Sam's a little retarded, too.  You know he's not well, too, right?  There's something going on.  Yeah, he's a little...  He's a little, like, mental. 
[03:14:00]  You know that, right?  He has that look.  He looks down.  His face is down, but his eyes are up thing.  And that's a sure sign of psychotic.  He looks down.  Retarded or psychotic?  I'll give you psychotic.  Everybody mistakes him as being this innocent guy that walks around here, but he's the biggest  prick out of everybody that works here.  And he has the Knight Rider eyes.  He has the...  He has those fucking creepy back and forth eyes.  They keep going back and forth.  Something's wrong with Sam. 
[03:14:30]  Something is wrong with Sam.  That's why we love him.  Here's the first track from Tyra helping sick kids, but turning around and making it about  herself.  I have a very rare type of cancer called polycythemia vera, and the thing I'm struggling with is  I don't get blood to the main veins that need it, and so I have really extreme pain that's  really horrible.  And another thing that I'm struggling with is the kids at school are really horrible about  accepting me with my cancer and things like that.  What do they say?  Do they say stuff to you at school? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, like in the sixth grade when I was diagnosed on April Fool's Day, a couple kids in my class  wrote, cancer can kill you on the wall and stuff like that, and like scream cancer in  my face and things like that.  You know what I would do?  Holy shit.  Oh yeah, kids are cool.  Are you fucking serious?  Kids are the worst.  Cancer, cancer, ha ha ha ha ha ha.  You got cancer.  Oh. 
[03:15:30]  Cirrhosis.  Cirrhosis on the liver.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Kids are the worst.  I missed my pussy waxing appointment on Wednesday, you fucking idiots.  Yeah, well, we're about to find out.  Let's go.  She went through the same thing.  A couple kids in my class wrote, cancer can kill you on the wall and stuff like that,  and like scream cancer in my face and things like that.  You know what I would do?  Because kids are so cruel. 
[03:16:00]  I've been a cruel kid, and I've been made fun of.  I've been on both sides.  And I think it's important to tell them that this really hurts me.  All right?  Okay.  What about you?  You hear the kid?  Yeah.  Yeah, thanks, bitch.  Original.  Yeah, great idea.  You know what happens?  Don't give me some money to go to the hospital and kill this shit.  You know what happens?  Boy, why couldn't Oprah get me so I could get some real advice?  When a kid is in your face.  I went on the show with her stupid hair falling out hoping to get some advice,  and she gets that horse shit.  When some kid's in your face going, cancer, cancer, ha ha, and you go, 
[03:16:30]  you know, that really hurts me.  They go, ha ha, good cancer.  They don't stop and think about it.  They don't be kids.  That little kid.  Like they have emotions.  They give a shit about anybody.  Her reaction was genius.  It was exactly like, okay.  She had an editing system as a young lady.  Uh-huh.  It was, uh-huh.  It was really, that spoke volumes.  That, she said, in that simple, uh-huh, she said, you stupid fucking asshole.  My mother didn't even give me that advice. 
[03:17:00]  She thought it was so hack.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, super.  I've been on both sides.  I've been made fun of, and I've made fun of people.  Actually, I just stood in the mirror and made fun of myself.  Oh, my God.  So, I know what it's like.  All right.  So, tell them it hurts.  Great.  Yeah, that'll stop them.  If you go up to somebody in high school or middle school and go, that hurts my feelings.  That really hurts.  Really?  You think those kids are open to psychology?  They probably would then punch you in the stomach.  Because that was always fun.  There was this kid in school. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, boy.  Here he comes again.  His name, I can't even remember.  But he was like, no, no, he's a fat kid.  Oh, it wasn't Dooley?  No, no, it wasn't Dally Dooley.  Oh, okay.  Dally Dooley.  It was this Patrick Fullan.  Where is it?  Patrick Fullan.  Jesus, just say his name.  He probably got over whatever his problem was.  Fuck him now.  He was Fullan with food.  He was.  He was the fat kid.  And a gang, I mean a gang every day. 
[03:18:00]  And I was one of those people because I was, of course, I wasn't going to do it alone.  But it's a mob.  Mob mentality.  Would walk up to him.  And we would all, as hard as we could, punch him in the stomach because we loved the funny face he made.  He made the fun.  We would belt him.  And he'd do this thing where his cheeks would puff out.  His eyes would roll around.  And he'd kind of go like, oof.  Like a blowfish with a blowfish with twirly eyes. 
[03:18:30]  And it was so funny, we would just repeatedly punch him in the stomach every day.  You know what he probably did?  He probably shot his drill instructor and then shot himself on a torch.  Oh, yeah.  Joker.  Dude, let me tell you.  I'm fucking 37 now.  Yeah.  And I got a MySpace from a motherfucker that said, I see you doing your thing.  And I remember he used to fuck with me.  The thing about when you're an asshole, you don't remember all the people you fuck with. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  And this motherfucker, and he reminded me.  It used to be this guy who just had a big nose.  And we would just stand in the hallway when he walked by and just go, Birdman.  That's all we would do.  Birdman.  And he was like, remember me?  He used to call me Birdman.  And I'm like, holy shit.  Motherfucker, we have gray hair and have to go to get prostate checks.  And you're fucking still upset about Birdman.  Did he grow into the nose? 
[03:19:30]  His nose was atrocious.  Holy shit.  That went out instead of down.  It was just like a cartoon nose.  But that you sang it is the best.  He would walk by.  You could see him take a gulp.  And he would just wait.  And he'd wait until he got a little fart.  And just, Birdman.  And that motherfucker wrote me a MySpace.  He still heard about that, dude.  He still heard. 
[03:20:00]  Fucking get over it, motherfuckers.  Jesus Christ.  Do you want to hear the next clip?  There's another kid.  In high school, we used to throw his jacket in the mud.  That would big, big mud puddle would form behind the school.  And we'd throw his jacket in there.  And then make him low crawl into the mud.  Because we had just seen Apocalypse Now.  And make him low crawl.  And if he tried to get up, we'd stomp down on his back and make him low crawl. 
[03:20:30]  Was you one of the leaders in this evil?  No, I was one of the middle guys.  Not the head bully, but not one of the guys that are ready to back out.  How can anybody believe in karma?  You're on your head of the top.  His parents probably said something like, don't worry.  You know, God will get them all back.  And it's like, you're a successful radio guy.  It's like, karma stinks.  Please with the karma.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  You are a horrible person.  And this guy's life probably fucked up because of that. 
[03:21:00]  I think I equaled it out because I was nice to other people.  What, the stronger ones?  Yeah.  That could defend themselves?  You fucking piece of shit.  People that were like me.  And the positive karma outdoes the karma.  And then there were things like, I was just, it was part of being like, with the in crowd.  But I wasn't even with the in crowd.  I was with the dirtbags that would, like as a group, be goofed on.  But we were the guys with the stupid, you know, army jackets and the private stripes smoking pot in the back hall.  Look how cool we are. 
[03:21:30]  I was alone, dude.  But we were completely dominated by the jocks.  Like the jocks could come over and kick our asses.  So they couldn't stand us.  So we had to shit on somebody.  So we would shit on like the AV squad and all those nerdy, geeky people.  And who did the AV squad like?  They couldn't really shit on each other.  They had a little hierarchy.  The swim team.  The swim team.  The fucking band.  Did you have a waterhead section in your high school?  Retards, not in high school.  And everyone left the Crips alone.  You know, the crippled people, not the gangs or anything.  Not the Crips. 
[03:22:00]  You know, they're like, we have Crips in Elwood.  Everyone left the Bloods alone, not the Bloods.  The motherfuckers used to have.  Sickle cell.  The motherfuckers used to have.  Hemophilia.  Hemophilia.  The blood.  Of a blooded thing.  What's the one in Africa?  The fuck's up, what I'm going to say.  Ebola.  Ebola.  Ebola kids we leave alone.  The ones that had Ebola.  But there was always that, you know, you got to shit on that.  But solo, like alone, I would talk to certain people that would be bullied by the same group 
[03:22:30]  I was in.  Like, but I would never let my friends see me talking to that person.  I was never, I was never a bully.  I was, I always attacked beautiful girls and motherfuckers that beautiful girls fuck.  The top people I would attack.  That's how I was, I was in the in crowd because people were so afraid of me that I was just  good at making somebody feel bad.  There was, there was, there was one time I felt, I feel, and I feel guilty to this day 
[03:23:00]  that I didn't do something.  And there was this girl and she was, uh, she, she was kind of goofy, cute, you know, funny  looking cute kind of thing.  And she was new in school and everyone was making fun of her for some reason.  And she was in her locker getting her books, like kneeling down, getting her books.  And a bunch of guys came over and kicked the locker and, and I guess they wanted to shut  it on her or something, but her head was in the way and it slammed smack into her head 
[03:23:30]  as I was standing right there.  And she just, she didn't move, but she just kind of was still kneeling down there and just  started crying hysterical.  And I, I wanted to go up and say, wow, that really sucked.  You know, can I help you up?  May take you to the nurse or something.  I would have fucked your status.  And I didn't fucking do it.  You fucked up now as a man.  I didn't do it.  You go, Ooh, pussy time.  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  What did it do with your head?  Let me help you with your books.  Yeah.  Oh, that had to hurt.  Let me walk you to the wall.  Let me walk you.  Yeah.  You guys are assholes.  But it wasn't even about getting laid or anything.  I think it was probably eighth, seventh grade, maybe somewhere around there, eighth grade.  So, but it wasn't about even getting laid at that point or something.  Right, right.  It was just like, ah, this poor girl, you know, she's new in school, no friends, and  these fucking assholes kick a lock a door in her head. 
[03:24:30]  And I can't even have the balls to go up and say, you know, are you okay?  Can I do anything?  You know what?  So I just looked at her crying and fucking walked away.  You're pouring your little heart out, and that must have really bothered you.  It did.  It bothered me.  So this day, you're 57, and you still remember that fucking story.  How does that even happen?  From Gen D.  How does that even fucking happen?  From Generation D.  Is that what I'm saying?  There's a 57-year-old woman just hurt with a lump on her head. 
[03:25:00]  She's like, with a little dent on her head.  She's like, you know what happened one day?  Let me tell you a story.  Anthony, I apologize ahead of time, but I can't help myself.  Dean in South Dakota, go ahead.  Hey, Anthony, you know Karma.  You know its name.  Yeah?  Its name's Jennifer.  Ah, true.  Okay.  The ex-wife.  All right, right, right.  There's where the Karma came into play.  All right, we got to take a break.  I got a leak, man.  More tire clips, and then, like, we got a guy on the line.  He said that he used to dangle Twinkies in front of fat people at school.  You know what? 
[03:25:30]  I'm really seeing how Sam is enjoying every one of these bullying stories more than anyone else.  He's laughing.  No, not really.  But he loves people's misery.  He is a fucking prick.  He's some type of nigga, half-breed, mutated.  That's his X-Men power.  Englomerated mongrel.  Almost nigger man.  Almost nigger man.  His X-Men power.  His X-Men power.  I'm almost a nigga.  I'm sorry. 
[03:26:00]  We confuse you.  Matt Nino, I can almost get credit.  Can I?  His mutant.  His mutant.  He has a .0 rating in his mutant powers.  All right, listen.  I can grow a small afro.  You can get halfway through the application at the country club.  I can sit on Juggernaut's shoulders while he's running and just go,  Almost a nigga coming.  Almost a nigga.  Oh, they're going to Photoshop that one. 
[03:26:30]  And we got more examples of dopey radio guys not knowing the rules.  Yeah.  And more bullying.  I like that.  Yeah.  Leak time.  All right, go take a leak.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony MQ line.  Fuck everyone.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I just want to get a big old fuck you to that Schneider driver.  It wouldn't move our truck off the damn fuel line.  Apparently your cell phone only works at Fuel Island. 
[03:27:00]  Fuck you, you fat bitch.  Pick up an apple instead of a Twinkie once in a while.  Yeah, this is a big F you to my fucking dispatcher.  What a tool.  I don't want any wild mugs left.  I don't want any of those on my truck.  What a fucking jack off.  Oh, hey, sexually harass me.  Sexually harass my cock, you faggot.  Ugh, what an asshole.  Go fuck yourself.  This fuck you goes out to Isaiah Thomas.  Isaiah, I like you, man. 
[03:27:30]  But come on, make some fucking trade, you soft-spoken motherfucker.  Hey, I'm trying.  I'm trying to do real good.  We'll try to make a trade for Iverson or something, you motherfucker.  Isaiah Thomas, fuck you.  Fuck you, you fucking fucker, faggot.  Fuck.  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, fuck him.  XM202.  Hey, Keith wants to take Big Red home.  Are we done with him?  Big Red's been hanging all morning.  He's going to be part of the homeless shopping spree a week from tomorrow.  He's a tippy-tom look-alike, but if you say that to him, he gets really, really pissed off.  Yeah, he gets pissed.  Because he doesn't want people to think that he sucks cock.  Yeah, we ought to get him in here so he can...  Say goodbye, at least.  Say goodbye, and, you know, he's not going to get dumped out of. 
[03:28:30]  All right.  We got a mic for him?  Yeah.  What's up, Big Red?  Yeah, that's what you better say.  I can hear you outside.  Oh, really?  Oh, I know he can hear us.  He really wants to try you, nigga.  What's up?  I'm just staying in the office.  He wants to try you.  He wants to try you.  You're digging the Guinness, my friend.  You like the Guinness?  Yeah, it ain't good.  Yeah, Guinness is good stuff.  What's your favorite beer, Big Red?  What?  Bud.  King of beers?  What?  Bud, why is it King of beers? 
[03:29:00]  What do you think that nigga knows the fucking...  You think he's seen the commercial?  He knows what King of beers is.  He don't know what no fucking King of beers is.  Hey, Big Red, he's insulting you.  Nope.  I didn't say he looked like Tippy Tone.  What?  When I catch him outside being a bully, I hit him with a two-by-four.  Oh.  Yeah, you know.  He's going back to Hacksaw Jim Duggan reference.  This guy...  Yeah, he's with him.  He's only one not drink from being good again.  It's like, why don't you just stop fucking drinking, man?  Why don't you stop gaining fucking weight? 
[03:29:30]  I'm trying, you motherfucker.  But you ain't trying...  All right, let's do this.  You ain't fucking trying nothing.  Let's go to McDonald's, I guarantee you.  And first of all, I don't appreciate how a homeless man can cross his legs with such  dignifying elegance.  Yeah, because you're here, because...  You know why?  Hold on, hold on.  I want to hear this guy.  Go ahead.  You know why?  What?  Because I bet you your asshole is as open as a motherfucking tippy-tom.  No, nigga.  What's up?  You got your mouth?  How do you know?  Pull your pants down.  We can play. 
[03:30:00]  Uh-oh.  I do know.  Why don't you pull his pants down?  He's really good.  I'm just saying, dude, you're only a second from being not who you are.  I'm a good guy.  I know you're a good guy, but it's like...  We're down at Penn Station.  Every cop will tell you, don't fuck with me, because I'll knock you right down the escalator.  But you don't...  If I knocked you down the escalator, you'd bounce and break the fucking escalator.  See, he's giving you a compliment, though, bro.  Yeah, I mean...  He's saying you are, like, so close to not being a homeless guy. 
[03:30:30]  You're this close to, like, having a life and a family and a house and, you know...  I don't call that shit.  I don't need it.  You don't need it?  I need the drink.  Nah, man.  You don't need that shit, man.  Is that drink going to be there bedside with you?  Yeah, come on, dude.  When maybe, you know, the lung cancer really kicks in, you know, saying goodbye?  Yeah, the boys are going to bring up the vodka and the beer.  Oh, okay.  Then fuck it.  The boys?  How are you going to find them?  Everybody got cell phones.  You got family playing on your fucking sprint?  That's what I'm saying, man. 
[03:31:00]  You're living a life that...  He's not no motherfucker.  He don't have all that bullshit mental disease.  He's just choosing...  You're just choosing a drink.  You're just choosing it, man.  It's like, you're a sharp dude.  You ever try to not drink?  Nope.  You never try to go through AA or nothing like that?  Why are you so defiantly...  Like, when you say I'm a fat motherfucker...  You tell me to go to AA, I'll stay there one day till I get the shakes off and I sign out.  And then back to more drinking.  What, in the first bodega or liquor store?  Hacksaw, why, though? 
[03:31:30]  Hacksaw?  You look a little bit like Hacksaw Jim Duggan.  No, no, no.  Listen, why, though?  Like, when you say you're a fat guy to me, right?  I don't...  Like, it's hard.  If you say, listen, don't eat pork and shit...  I don't want to eat pork.  It's hard not to, but I'm not just going to go suck my dick.  I'm eating pork.  I'm going to kill myself.  Why do you want to kill yourself?  What happened?  I didn't die yet.  You ready for...  Who the fuck says I got lung cancer?  Yippee!  I don't care.  As long as I die with a cigarette in my hand and a bottle. 
[03:32:00]  Why do you want to do that, though?  I really live my...  And a matter of fact, why...  So if you...  Why do you continue to just, like, struggle on if you want to die?  I'm not struggling.  Well, the homeless life seems a little tough.  And he's smart enough.  He's smart enough to have double-talking answers, too.  Yeah, yeah.  That's just...  You know what I'm saying?  Like, he's the double-talker.  You know, when the psychiatrist starts to get in his head, he's like...  And then it's like, they just go, fuck it, dude. 
[03:32:30]  You can see it.  He's a fucking smart dude.  But you just accepted this beer shit.  Like, why?  Why is all I'm asking?  Why?  Why is a crooked letter that can't be straight?  See?  Why?  Why is a crooked letter that can't be straight?  He's saying what he is is what he is.  It is what it is.  It's like asking an alligator, why'd you bite that fucking warthog to the head off?  Fair enough.  The guy is what he is.  It is what it is.  I'll go with that.  You don't have a story or anything.  You just decide you like drinking and that's it.  You're not hiding anything.  You're not, like, trying to drink away some pain from the past. 
[03:33:00]  Of course it's fucking pain.  Every time I put that fucking...  I enjoy myself.  ...that powdered donut near my mouth, what do you think?  There's no pain here?  I want to start fighting.  You're covering up something.  Something's going on?  I enjoy myself by myself.  When you see me this morning, who was with me?  Nobody but the garbage can and my bottle of my can of beer.  You had a good life growing up with the folks and all that?  Hey, could you get that guy?  Oh, yeah.  I had good lives, but...  Is that a guy?  The garbage can?  Can we get him for the homeless shopping spree? 
[03:33:30]  Oh, I thought that was a buddy of yours calling the garbage can.  That's what I said.  He does look a little like Oscar the Grouch, too.  A little bit.  Like, doesn't he just come out?  He'll pop out.  He'll pop out.  Just all...  He'll pop out.  You sound a little like Quint.  I'm like Big Quint.  Fuck you.  Here's the swimming with bow-legged women.  Yeah, hey, you got a little of that.  There you go, Chief.  That's all right.  Some of this made it myself.  Pretty good stuff.  Show me the way he has...  Don't forget your rubbers.  He has yellow eyes.  Like...  Okie Bar, Boston, celebrating my third wife's demise. 
[03:34:00]  Yellow eyes, like jaundice eyes.  That's good, right, Big Red?  That's a good impression, right?  Well, Big Red...  Hey, we got Bob Saget on the line.  A good friend of ours.  Fucking Bob.  You know who Bob Saget?  You know Bob Saget?  I love a pig, woman.  Hey, Big Red, you know who Bob Saget is?  No.  You ever see America's Funniest Home Videos?  Oh, here we go.  Can I say to Bob...  No.  This is Patrice, Bob.  Can I please say this before it doesn't get in?  I've been...  I wanted to try to find your number somehow to say that 1 vs. 100 is the best game show 
[03:34:30]  I've ever seen.  Oh, my God.  Thank you very much.  It really is great.  It's fucking...  I'm so happy for you, dude.  It's the...  It's fantastic.  I love 1 vs. 100.  That is a crazy night.  I really thought they were going to call it 1 fucking vs. 100.  I just wanted to say that, man.  I fucking...  I love that, man.  I love that show.  I'm addicted to it.  That's really nice.  I can put you in the mob if you play for charity.  I fucking would do it. 
[03:35:00]  I mean, I don't think I'm...  I'm really a C-list, maybe D-list.  I don't...  I need that money.  If I see a charity, yeah.  If I see 60 G's, nigga, let me...  Let me play that.  Let me get my tennis.  Can I get some money?  Let me get my tennis.  I had actually two people that are in the mob that have been convicted.  They were in the mob.  Oh, the real mob.  Real mob.  He had Kevin Fiddle line on the other day.  Hey, yeah.  This is this real hardcore mob dude.  And this guy, Kevin's just, you know, a nice guy that likes to take a pee by himself. 
[03:35:30]  But I think he sits to pee, too.  I was in the bathroom.  I felt bad.  But are you guys still there?  Barely.  Barely, Bob, if you need to know.  Yes, Bob.  Bob, I got to ask you a question.  Ovi, is it your birthday?  No, it was Patrice's birthday yesterday.  Hi.  I'm getting all this misinformation.  I don't know.  I thought on some girl's back in Sharpie, I think that it was your birthday today.  Jesus, Bob.  Hey, Bob, you've been seeing the commercials for a movie with your buddy John Stamos? 
[03:36:00]  Yes, sir.  About him playing a gay gentleman?  Yes, sir.  And there's a scene, even in the commercial, where he kisses another man.  And you could see the look.  I said to my girlfriend, I go, John Stamos has to be so heterosexual because it must have  been, like, take 80, and he is wincing as he's kissing this guy.  Wincing.  Tell yourself that I had my tongue up his ass once and he hated it. 
[03:36:30]  See?  He's hetero.  You know, we talk about this with actors from time to time.  I don't get it.  Why would you ever play, like, a gay guy in a movie or TV show?  It's a thing.  You think it's going to get you a fucking Emmy?  Yeah, it's like playing a retard.  Retard?  But you need the statue that bad up your ass for them to go, wow, this guy's a  fucking...  It put Will Smith on him, man.  Bob, explain this to us, please.  You're obviously Hollywood there.  I think the trifecta is a special ed gay guy. 
[03:37:00]  That's why you win.  Oh, wow.  That's a win-win because you don't even know where the guy's putting it.  And you go, I'm sorry, that's not my ass.  And it is.  You know, the guy has a feeling in his ass because he's a special kid.  And you're automatically drooling when you're giving a blowjob.  It's just foaming.  With that big tongue.  It's probably, if you have a seizure while you're blowing a guy, that's a multiple orgasm  for that guy.  It's going to feel great.  And the problem is when you win the Oscar, you don't know who to thank.  You're so fucked up.  Yeah, but you could talk with both hands because you could just stick the Oscar up your ass. 
[03:37:30]  Believe it or not, don't you think a lot of guys or women who have won that have done  that?  How can you not take something so sleek?  Do you think there's been an Oscar up someone's ass?  Did Rock Hudson ever win one?  That's got to be there.  Robert Reed?  Yeah, you had to be there, right?  I think it is actually named, it is named, a wiener was named Oscar as well.  Oscar, fire, wiener.  I got nothing this morning. 
[03:38:00]  Bob, did Stamos, did Stamos, have you spoken to him since he did this movie?  Yes, yes.  I talked to him while he was doing the movie.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, he was like in Greenland or something.  Nova Scotia is where he did the thing.  He says there's nobody there and he was in character.  Your show's much better than Deal and No Deal.  Wow, look at that.  Look at that.  That is the most on track I've ever heard a conversation.  So you're saying it's the best suitcase show on television? 
[03:38:30]  It is.  We have no briefcase.  I was scared of terrorism, you know?  I was scared of it.  And the questions are like hard, easy questions.  Like they're hard and easy and they're fun the way they do it.  And the whole idea of this fucking mob thing just erasing as you go along.  It's fucking, it really is good.  I'm happy for Bob Saget.  He's like, you can tell Bob has been in the game so long that he doesn't want to get into,  because he's into probably fucking bad luck and don't want to fucking jinx himself. 
[03:39:00]  Well, you know, we all have, everybody has, whatever bad luck is, you know, things happen.  I got a dad who's kind of, this is sick this year, you know, you can't.  He doesn't want to go talk about how good the show might be.  Right.  I'm going to say it should get off, that dumb bald Howie Mandel that shouldn't be bald head.  He has the head that he should have the I went bald hair on the side.  Stop with your fucking...  Paul Schaefer's got that too. 
[03:39:30]  Paul Schaefer, don't.  Paul Schaefer should have the horseshoe hair.  He should have a horseshoe bald head.  Right.  So you could just like take his head and throw it for luck, is that what you're saying?  That'd be interesting.  I love Howie.  Howie's a friend of mine.  And Howie, you know, doesn't like to touch you on the hands, because there's a lot of  jerks.  Yeah, he's jerks.  But he will do full frontal cock on cock nudity with him.  Little known, little known about Howie.  Thanks, Paul.  He shaves his head, but the end of his penis is like a chia pet. 
[03:40:00]  He's got hair there.  It's like a bonsai plant.  It's beautiful.  Hey, Bob, they ordered a bunch of new shows, right?  One versus 100.  You're going to be doing it for a while?  Yeah, that's true.  I think we got some more.  They just put some more on the schedule.  And we even have one like Christmas night.  You'll like this, because you guys have been...  I've got to thank you, Open Anthony.  You really supported this thing.  At first, you went like, well, what the fuck is this going to be?  And then all of a sudden, you watched it.  And I dig it.  I'm sorry.  I like it.  Which, that's what I said.  But I go to work. 
[03:40:30]  They don't like to tell me too much what's going on.  I'm like a ferret-sensing danger, you know?  So I get there, and they say, oh, the night show is going to be a Christmas show.  It's going to be on the night of Christmas Day, the 25th, which is a Monday.  Already, I know that we're more than Fridays now.  They're just starting that thing.  And they say, it's on at 10 o'clock, so try to go a little bluer.  Oh.  I was like, oh, okay.  All right, I'll try.  I think I could do it.  I started by shooting a load of a contestant, and then it was uphill from there.  Hey, someone is suggesting a show, Dog Shit Sniffer from Woodside, a new show called Squeal or Don't Squeal? 
[03:41:00]  I think it's a great idea.  I'm going to pitch that today, and that's a question of, I guess the question is cornholing, right?  Yeah, that would have to be on real late.  Is that your show, you came up with that show, Bob?  I would still be down with that.  No, one versus a hundred, that's not your idea, right?  Is that your, are you an EP on that?  No, no, no.  You don't get the idea money, do you?  No, no, the idea came from the Deutsch.  It came from Germany about seven years ago. 
[03:41:30]  They started this show there, and I think on that version, it's not as big a set.  You could actually probably parody it on Saturday Night Live with the size of their set.  I'm working on a show from Germany.  They did it, it aired about 63 years ago or so, and I'm trying to bring that back.  What's it called?  Thank you.  That's my self.  Is that the deal with Scheiser?  Well, good.  I hear what you're saying. 
[03:42:00]  Seven years old, this damn thing.  It came out of Endemol, which is also a pain reliever, but that's the Dutch company that makes it.  And they put it on, and then, you know.  I think, you know what, Bob sounds like he just finished jerking off like four times.  He's trying to.  I've had phone things that's like, you're trying to be on, and it's just, Bob, are you fucking or jerking off or doing some type of heroin?  It's like five in the morning there, and he's. 
[03:42:30]  I'm on heroin.  I'm getting blown by a pig.  I'm actually on the way to shoot a one versus 100 in my car, and I got my kids off to school, and then I realized that you guys mean more to me than my own children.  So, I just wanted to raise you guys and breastfeed you both.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  I sound like a crackle with diarrhea.  How many comics wish for one show that would last like a year?  You know, just one show. 
[03:43:00]  This guy, the goddamn video show, and then where he plays the faggot father, and then.  And one versus 100, it can't get old.  You know what I mean?  And don't you forget I was a faggot father.  How could you not?  You could take that to the bank.  How many times are you sitting with those cute little girls on the side of the bed, and you didn't even lean over for a kiss?  I got video of Bob Saget calling somebody a nigger's name.  Oh, really?  Yeah, dirty nigger.  What, is it a laugh factory?  Back in 80, he didn't even say back in 1950. 
[03:43:30]  He said back in 90, we'd have you with a forky.  A forky.  I was on a press tour the other day, and I was trying to talk to you guys, and I was compelled to listen.  I was holding for like 10 minutes, and it wasn't appropriate for me to come in, and Joe Rogan was talking about comedy.  And I love Joe, and then Jamie Masada comes in, and you say it to him, and he's like, buddy, be nice.  Be nice, buddy.  I think the only solution right now, actually, is, and I've always known Michael Richards, and to me, it's just, you know, everything is just bizarre in the world happening wrong at the wrong moment, obviously. 
[03:44:00]  I think he needs to give a liver, one of his organs, to a black guy.  To a black baby.  A black baby needs his liver.  David Wayans got suspended from the thing.  Yeah, it's just dumb.  Ridiculous.  If you can do that, then there will be peace and love.  That's just dumb.  Just one lobe of a liver.  I say all you comedians go to the life factory and say the word and get banned. 
[03:44:30]  And then what is Jamie going to do?  Are you fucking kidding?  And then what is Jamie going to do?  Are you joking about the camaraderie of these fucking pussy-ass comics?  Oh, really?  You guys get together, well, you get together when it comes down to money.  You get together in a room without beating on each other.  I got a problem because I was like 22, so I met everybody, and I came out to LA, and I don't know.  I was there when Michael did his first spot at the improv.  I gave him a piece of my colon, I remember.  What a guy.  I believe you're only as good as your last organ donation. 
[03:45:00]  Hey, Bob, what are we promoting today?  One versus the hundred.  Oh, he doesn't need to promote that.  It's another hit.  Right, his third hit.  I've opened my own tap smear business.  All right.  It's going good, man.  I'm not kidding.  I'm in it.  I'm tapping it.  I'm Q-tipping.  I'm putting it on us.  Is your show beating that bald germaphobe show?  Not yet.  You guys are wordsmiths.  You guys are wordsmiths. 
[03:45:30]  I am, yeah, One Versus 100 is on tonight with an all-new thing, right?  And then it keeps going.  I got a Christmas episode, and I got some other thing that promotes that.  They have some NBC grease thing, which I've got dripping out of my ass right now.  So, and then the other thing is I'm coming to Philly.  I'm doing a show January 19th at Tower Theater.  Oh, very cool.  Cool place.  Yeah, I've always wanted to play there.  And then January 20th, the next day, I'm at the Borgata in Atlantic City.  I'm headlining that place. 
[03:46:00]  So, I'm excited about that.  Jesus Christ.  Hey, Bob, has anyone ever asked you what your biggest bomb in entertainment was?  I mean, we all know about the hits.  You know, a long time ago, about seven years ago, I went through, like, a whole thing where  I wasn't working as much, and I was, like, really pissed off and feeling sad.  I had a sitcom on the WB for a year, which was, like, ten minutes in a hummingbird.  Oh, I remember that shit.  Right.  I remember that.  I do remember that shit, man.  It was, like, fucking horrendous.  You should do Hallmark cards. 
[03:46:30]  I really believe that.  We call them sag-  What is it, sag-isms?  Bob is, like, the most positive fucking guy in the world.  Can't get him talking about it.  You're very nice.  And I haven't always been, but I'm saying, like, seven years ago, I just said, I'm going  to start trying to hit over the fence, no matter what I do.  So, the last time I bombed was yesterday.  No, the last time I bombed was probably about seven, eight years ago, like a bomb-bomb, where  I went, what the fuck am I doing here?  And I don't go and attack the audience back. 
[03:47:00]  I just start talking about my dick or something, you know?  And then I scream at my dick for everything that's happened to me, you know?  I'm a self-blamer.  Tells his dick it would be hanging in a tree with a fork in it.  That was some kind of tricky way to fuck with Kramer.  And something about Kramer, because no one came to his fucking-  You hear this?  That guy was an asshole.  I'm smelling it.  Too many guys who are from the-  Like, you started, what, 60-what, Bob? 
[03:47:30]  Like, too many fucking old-school motherfuckers that were started with Michael Richards didn't  come-  They fucking-  It was personal.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, no comic should have fucking been on him about that word.  Mel Gibson's the only guy.  It was just people fucking hated him.  Mel Gibson's the only guy that came through the day.  He was an asshole.  I guarantee Michael Richards was an asshole.  I don't know him, but you can hear it.  And that's why they got you.  I do know him, but, you know, it's just, it fucked up, right? 
[03:48:00]  But, and you don't have that kind of anger on stage.  The bottom line is, and I'm not-  It is a passing judge.  Did you like him, Bob?  Was he friends?  If you got a lot of hatred on you, or having a rough time at the moment, you just don't  go on stage.  You stay away, and you go get the help before you-  Man, fuck that.  Did you like Kramer as a person?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's convincing.  He was always-  Let me tell you something, that was true romance.  You would have got shot in the head.  That was a bad pantomime. 
[03:48:30]  You would have got shot before I checked the bill, nigga.  By the way, shot in the head is highly underrated.  I mean, one of my favorite movies, one of my favorite movies is the Bruder film.  So, I mean, we gotta stop and take a breath here, and really think about what we're saying.  All right, Bob.  Once you start saying getting shot in the head is wrong, everything's gone to hell.  Bob, we gotta let you go, because we're wrapping up.  Bob, I do want to promote something else.  Everyone's talking about your YouTube video, Rolling with Saget. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, that was my friend Jamie Kennedy, and we went and shot that thing, and MTV spent  like a quarter of a million bucks on it.  And they shot this thing, and it looks like I'm pissing on the street, but it's actually  a water bottle with a real thick stream.  If my dickhead was that big, I would probably bleed all my internal organs out, you know?  Yeah, well, you can check it out on YouTube.  People are enjoying that.  All right, Bob.  You guys are great.  You know why?  You never, ever fake laugh, and it gives me time to think.  Yeah. 
[03:49:30]  All right.  No, you guys are fucking awesome.  Happy birthday, whenever it happens.  All right.  Thank you, Bob.  Thank you.  Catch you guys later.  All right.  Thanks for all the props.  Bob Saget, everyone.  One versus a hundred.  Check it out.  All right.  We're just about out of here, but Danielle from Florida has something.  Danielle.  Yeah, it's Daniel, but hey.  Oh, Daniel.  All right.  What's up, Daniel?  Hey, not much.  I just wanted to ask Tippi Tom what he plans on getting during the homeless shopping spree.  Oh, hold on.  Can we turn on his mic?  Oh, my dear sweet Lord. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, my God.  Daniel, he did not hear that, so you want to say it again?  Yeah.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  What's up, man?  I'm not fucking Tippi Tom.  Who the fuck are you?  I'm Daniel.  Hey, Tippi Tom.  What are you getting during the homeless shopping spree?  I'm going to get you a fucking dildo to stick up your ass.  Thanks, but what are you planning on getting?  Come on.  I know there's one thing you got your eye on.  Not you.  That's for damn sure.  Hey, look.  Like I said, for the people calling in to talk to Big Red, this is serious. 
[03:50:30]  He doesn't want to be called Tippi Tom.  Yeah, he doesn't want to be called Tippi Tom.  He's not Tippi Tom.  He's not Tippi Tom.  So if you're calling in to ask him questions and serious questions only, he's not Tippi Tom.  He's not Tippi Tom, all right?  So please, you know, we're starting to promote the homeless shopping spree with Big Red, and  he does not want to be confused for Tippi.  Big Red, you know what that's about?  The whole shopping spree thing?  Yeah.  We take you to the mall. 
[03:51:00]  Yeah.  We toss you some cash, and you go shopping and get yourself some good stuff.  Yeah, and Tippi Tom better be on the other side.  Yeah, you don't worry about that.  You don't want him too close to you, right?  I don't blame you, sir.  What do you got, the hospital wristband on?  I see you got the hospital wristband on.  Yeah, what's up?  Yeah, it's got to stay there.  Oh, you got to go back?  Yeah.  Yeah?  What are they going to do about that?  Are they going to operate on you?  I don't know yet.  Oh, they did tests?  Yeah, I got to go.  See how bad it is?  I got to go back to 28. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  You got to go back?  Yeah.  That's a drag.  What are you going to do?  Speaking of drag, how about a cigarette?  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  What do you smoke?  Non-filters?  Lucky.  Anything.  You got a cigarette?  I'm dying for one.  Yeah, you certainly are, huh?  Yeah.  You know, Big Red, you look like Santa Claus that just came out the chimney.  Hey, Big Red.  Big Red.  I'm going to tell you something, you fat fuck.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  What the fuck you think you look like with that fuck nose over there? 
[03:52:00]  Oh, shit.  Feisty.  Wow.  You look like you got a pug nose.  Oh, shit.  Hey, Michael Richards.  Jesus.  Hey, uh.  That's a mean.  Look, a lot of people want to talk to Big Red about the homeless shopping spree, which  is going down a week from Saturday.  All right.  The phones have exploded.  We want to get to know Big Red.  Dave from Georgia.  Go ahead.  Hey, uh, Tippy Tom.  I'm going to be up there.  I got your Tippy Tom between my legs.  So, uh, just wondering.  Maybe you want to, like, run off to the bathroom. 
[03:52:30]  Maybe you can earn a few extra bucks.  Why don't you come over to New York and I'll see you.  All right.  Uh, wow.  That was obviously a prank.  Uh, Mike in Jersey.  You got a question for, for Big Red.  Hey there, Big Tippy Tom.  How you doing, sweet sugar?  I got your fucking Tippy Tom.  Come on in.  I wonder if you'd like me to, uh, you want me to buy you some lunch today?  You sound like you're kind of hungry.  I always like buying, uh, Tippy Tom some lunch.  You hungry?  No, I'm not hungry.  You go buy Tippy Tom.  I judge like a mouthful of real human food.  I'll give you some fucking, I wouldn't trust none of you fucks.  Come on.  All right.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey. 
[03:53:00]  Uh, Mike, got a question for, uh, our, our homeless guy here?  Uh, more a statement.  I just think it's great that, you know, Tippy Tom comes out of the closet and he's really  representing all the gay homeless out there.  I mean, you're fucking gay.  You're just, you're just a strong man, Tippy Tom, and, you know.  You sound fucking gay.  You should go see Tippy Tom.  Tippy Tom, you know, just, I just want to see you at the homeless hopping spree, you  know, sucking some cock for all gay men.  You come, you come.  Be proud.  Be proud.  You come where I can have that fucking butcher knife waiting for you. 
[03:53:30]  All right, Ron in New Jersey.  Ron?  Hey, I heard Tippy Tom was in there.  No, your sister is.  Hey, hey, remember that time I gave you the dollar in the corner?  You didn't give me no dollar in the corner.  I want that back.  Come over and get it.  All right, let's say hi to Will in Pennsylvania.  Will?  Yes?  Hey, I want to ask Tippy Tom.  That's a great Collin Quinn impression.  You sound like a Puerto Rican.  He said it's a great Collin Quinn impression.  He said he sounds like a Puerto Rican.  God damn. 
[03:54:00]  The fucking whitest guy you ever met, you ass.  Why don't you come over here and show me what you look like when I beat your ass?  All right, well, a lot of people calling in.  Big Red's a tough bastard.  He ain't fucking around.  You're a tough old bastard.  I like that.  He ain't fucking around.  Why don't we say hi to Pat in Boston?  Pat, what's up?  Hey, Golden Bands.  What do you think about that Grey Wolf song?  Nothing.  Nothing on that.  You got nothing.  You're the first one to fail, by the way.  He goes, yeah, fuck off.  Adam in Jersey, what's up? 
[03:54:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Tippy, why don't you do the fucking world a favor and go fucking kill yourself?  Why don't you come over and try to do it, you fucking faggot?  I'm a fucker.  Come over and try to do it, faggot.  Oh, shit.  All right.  All right.  He's like an angry, dirty Kris Kringle.  Why don't we go to Don the Trucker?  There's a theme here.  It's a little strange.  Yes, Don.  What's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  I just wanted to ask Tippy. 
[03:55:00]  Good morning.  I just wanted to ask Tippy Tom.  Is he going to buy any gifts for his family?  I'm going to buy you a fucking dildo, you cocksucker.  All right.  Well, let's go to Steve in Connecticut, Steve.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  Hey, how's your mother?  This guy's great.  Hold on.  Let's get it.  Steve has a question.  Steve, go ahead.  Start over there.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  Who's left?  How's your mother?  Stick in your mouth.  How's your mother?

Fucking big redhead fucking around.  He's got your mother.  My mom.  Let's go to Chris in Boston.  Chris.  Hey, Tippy Tom.  How's your mother?  I want to know where you got the name Golden Buns.  You should know.  You get fucked into buns.  Ramone.  All right.  Well, we're wrapping up here.  Terry in Georgia.  Yes, Terry. 
[03:56:00]  Hey, I'm going to get a little tippy to sing for us this morning.  Come and suck my dick and I'll sing.  Not a bummer or a singer.  Let's go to Creepy Cold Guy.  Creepy Cold Guy.  Good morning, shit dicks.  Hey.  Does Tippy Tom like syrup or jelly when he's tossing that salad?  Why don't you come over here and find out?  And when you bend over, you get something nice up your ass.  Ooh.  You must like it if you know how to do that good. 
[03:56:30]  All right.  Ah, Big Red.  Big Red.  We'll see you next Saturday for the homeless shopping.  Next Saturday.  We'll take you guys shopping.  Anything you need?  That's enough.  Yeah, that's enough.  Big Red.  Anything you need that you're going to get when you go shopping?  I'm going to get pants and like...  Pants, just some clothes.  Yeah, just clothes.  Maybe a jacket, nice warm jacket or something.  All right.  That's cool.  All right.  Good deal.  All right.  No problem.  We'll see you then.  You're a good guy.  All right.  You're a pretty funny motherfucker, I got to tell you. 
[03:57:00]  Yeah, you're all right.  Take care of him.  Make sure he loses weight.  All right.  Next time I come back, I don't want to see him that big.  Because, you know, I don't want to call him the bully, the fat boy.  Call him A, man.  You look skinny now.  You look like a human being instead of a pit bull.  Jesus Christ.  You can't call him a German Shepherd.  He's a little bigger than a German Shepherd.  Don't call him a pit bull.  You're starting to be shaped like a can of beer. 
[03:57:30]  I got them out there.  I got six of them.  I'm going to have a drink on the way back.  I'll have one for you, too.  Oh, man.  All right, big red.  I drink a lot of beer and I don't have a bully like that.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at you.  Do you wear a girl?  You are Santa Claus and Rudolph because your nose is just red.  I know we'll stay right.  Hey, I put a little shoe polish on me.  I look like you.  I knew he'd get there.  I knew it would take long. 
[03:58:00]  Don't you have any homeless black friends in?  I've got a bunch of them.  I work with them.  You work for them?  I mean, you work.  Yeah, we do the papers at night.  We drop them off.  Oh, that's right.  Jesus.  Okay.  Wow.  We don't get no money to him on Saturday.  We're going to have to ban him from the station with that kind of Michael Richards.  He's a renaissance boy.  I've got to go to the newsstand when they drop me up, and I've got to ask them for a bottle  of black shoe polish.  All right.  He really is a...  Big right.  We're going to see you in a week, man. 
[03:58:30]  He really is a part of all seasons.  He's like, hey, I'm going to play Santa Claus the 24th.  Oh, you're going to play Santa Claus?  Yeah, for Macy's.  Oh, yeah?  I do it every year.  You play Santa every year?  No, they dye my hair.  They dye my beard.  Are you kidding?  No.  No, I don't think he is kidding.  And you play Santa Claus.  I go to Macy's all the time.  I walk through the building all the time.  They know who I am.  I don't rob him.  Chris Tinkle.  Wait.  No, when I go, like, if it's too cold, I'll say.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm pissed at you. 
[03:59:00]  Instead of staying in Penn Station, I take a walk to Macy's.  I walk around the building, look at the clothes.  I don't rob him.  They don't know me.  This guy plays Santa?  That's great.  Yeah, I'll be going down.  I'll be going down.  All right, Big Red.  We'll see you next Saturday.  All right, Big Red.  Good job.  And Keith the Cop, thank you.  Another gem.  Keith knows how to pick him.  Never disappoint.  Oh, Big Red's an animal.  He really is an animal.  Take care of that, Big Red.  We never got to the...  Have a good day, and I'll buy the black shoe power.  Take care. 
[03:59:30]  You can't stop with that.  We get it.  Take care there, Big Red.  I know.  When I come back here, we'll be lost.  All right.  Buy some...  Homeless bigot.  Buy some non-filter cigarettes.  That's great.  Who knows?  By the 16th, he might not be around.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  We didn't do the rest of the tire clips.  We didn't do...  Yeah, it's all right.  We didn't do the Mark David Chapman audio.  Eh, we'll save it for Monday.  Eh, he shot, man.  What can I tell you?  Save it for Monday when it's completely irrelevant.  All right, here we go. 
[04:00:00]  Line of the day.  We got a runner-up and then the winner.  I guess Dan's doing something.  Either a prostate exam, or he's cleaning up the area where Big Red was because he's putting  on the gloves.  Bowdogfight.com, yeah, sponsors the line of the day.  Bowdogfight.com.  Check that out.  Check out that website.  Yes.  They're doing something with Russians, I think, and Americans.  Americans fighting.  Russians fighting.  DocuReality.  Martial arts. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you turn into Roland.  Martial arts.  Martial arts.  It says, um, Russian, American, but-a-da-da-net.  It's on but-a-da-da-net.  We didn't even get rolling on today.  God, there was so much we didn't get to, and we still had a fine show.  Someone was suggesting we get Big Red in a Santa suit for the homeless shopping spree.  That's a pretty good idea right there.  That would be pretty good.  And someone's going, you're going to take that shit, Humongous?  Yeah, he was fucking with Humongous. 
[04:01:00]  He was fucking with Humongous.  Motherfucker.  You should have stepped back into your daydream.  Oh, he was genius.  All right.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  What's the temperature today?  50 below my asshole.  Holy shit.  With a fucking windshield factor of my dick in your head, nigga.  Dick in your head.  That's cold.  It's that cold.  You know, I never see that on any of the weather forecasts.  I never say how much colder it's going to be than your asshole.  All right. 
[04:01:30]  And finally, so we should go home.  Or the bottom of it.  And enjoy our weekend.  Here is today's.  Oh, Patrice.  Caroline's.  All weekend.  Late shows.  Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday?  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  Here is today's line of the day.  Here comes.  The light of the day.  The light of the day.  The light of the day. 
[04:02:00]  The dairy aisle.  What's really in your favorite foods?  What did you...  What's in your favorite foods?  Mexicans.  Sleeping and going to the bathroom.  And giving you E. coli, apparently.  Yeah.  Ah, Patrice.  The light of the day.  Mexicans in your food.  That was great, by the way.  That was terrific.  Hey, by the way, a couple other plugs real fast.  Brother Wheeze is doing a show on this fine channel tomorrow night at 9 o'clock.  Is he coming all the way down to be in here?  Yeah, he is.  Flying from Rochester for the opportunity. 
[04:02:30]  A guy I respect greatly.  The opportunity.  He has a show, right?  Yeah, but he wants to be bigger than Rochester.  He doesn't have the fucking credentials to just say, hey, give me a job right fucking now?  He has to audition?  No, he's been stuck in a contract, and, you know, I don't know if XM's going to hire him  full-time or what the future holds.  He wants to do a show, though, so he's coming down to do a show.  Tomorrow night from 9 to midnight, you know, check out his show and show him some love,  okay?  And then we got Than and Sam doing their first show for XM, midnight. 
[04:03:00]  Right after Brother Wheeze?  Is that how it's going to work?  Okay.  So we got a lot of live programming tomorrow night from 9 to, what are you doing, 2, 3 hours?  So from 9 to, what, 3 in the morning?  Yep.  We'll be live on this channel tomorrow night.  What are you guys doing, playing music or talk?  No, those fuckers are going to do some talk radio.  Yep.  Patrice, have a little faith.  No, I have faith in Thane.  You're staring at him like, what?  You can talk?  I'm going to listen.  I'm going to listen just to fucking see what happens. 
[04:03:30]  Yeah, it's going to be interesting, so.  All right, guys.  Thanks, man.  It is.  I'm just tired.  It is going to be interesting.  Tune in.  All right.  I'm supporting you guys.  I'll be there.  Elo's not supporting you.  You know that from the lunch yesterday.  What?  I had the lunch go.  Did I miss anything?  It was all right.  I missed nothing, right?  I knew it.  You missed hanging with a group and showing them some love for a fine job they did this  year?  Yeah, just being a fucking human being for once in your life.  I was hanging with a group.  A social creature, which is what human beings are.  I was hanging with a group of almost 1,000 people in PalTalk last night as I was being interviewed 
[04:04:00]  for their new launch of PalTalk 9.0.  You sneezed right into the inside of your jacket?  It's not that bad?  That's good, though.  You keep the germs away.  We didn't even talk about your PalTalk.  I know.  My PalTalk.  People were making fun of me.  I wore an argyle sweater and a corduroy jacket next to a fire in my fireplace in a chair.  Did you have a real fire going?  Yeah.  It was a fireside chat. 
[04:04:30]  And people were like, dude, did Anthony get dressed up just for PalTalk?  I was like, don't you get...  It's a fireside chat.  Like, I'm doing a goof on a fireside chat.  But a lot of people.  And they just were being pests.  And then who came on after me?  The real Kramer.  Kenny Kramer.  Kenny Kramer.  Ugh.  And the room of pests didn't leave.  They were not able to get one question in without Ramon. 
[04:05:00]  Plenty of Ramones.  A lot of Big A references.  Chubby bunnies.  They would not...  The guy couldn't ask him a question.  And then they were calling him, like, racist and saying, why did you say nigger?  And he was like, it's not me.  He was trying to defend himself to these people.  Even though it's not him, that's great.  And then I actually changed my name and called up.  And I called up. 
[04:05:30]  Well, I, you know, hit the talk button.  And I said, I said, I just want to say, I live in New Orleans.  I said, it says jazz guy that came on next.  And my name is Bill.  I'm from Crystal, New Orleans.  And I lost everything.  And I just want to tell you your inspiration.  I did that whole thing.  And, of course, the people hollering, just laughing and laughing.  Did you do the catchphrase, too?  Of course I did. 
[04:06:00]  All right, good.  I have it right.  Where did it go?  Damn it.  I want to hear the real one.  Here it is.  Can you dig that?  I knew that you could.  I knew that you could.  All right.  So it went well.  That's awesome.  Fucking Crystal.  Yeah, it went very well.  Good.  We set the record for the amount of people that were in PalTalk for that whole two days worth  of celebrities that were on.  Scooter?  Hi.  How are you doing today?  All right.  Hey, I'm a big fan of y'all.  I really do enjoy the show, even though I'm a reasonably new listener. 
[04:06:30]  I was thinking it might be fun to have Patrice, by the way, happy birthday, and Roland do bonus  time today.  Patrice has to go home.  He's sneezing on the inside of his coat at this point.  He's done.  But how about we do Roland radio?  Roland!  Roland radio sounds awesome, guys.  I got to go.  Punch it out.  Because we didn't get to talk about the movies that are out today, and maybe he's in touch  with what's going on out there in the entertainment world. 
[04:07:00]  So Roland, you want to do a few more minutes for us?  Roland radio?  What?  What?  What?  You what?  What?  We're going to a meeting at 11.30.  I got it.  Downtown.  Oh.  Yeah.  There's not too many movies out this week.  Just Blood Diamond.  It was really good.  Go see it.  Why is Blood Diamond really good?  It was an action with Leo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly.  It's about diamonds, the pink diamond that's worth a lot of money. 
[04:07:30]  Yeah.  To save the village.  I've just never seen anybody so uncomfortable.  Oh, right?  Jesus Christ, Roland.  Roland.  Yeah.  We were talking earlier.  We saw the trailer for this movie called 300.  Know anything about it?  I haven't seen the trailer yet.  No.  What about Mel Gibson's flick?  Apocalypto.  About the Mayans.  What is it called?  Apocalypto.  It's about the what?  The Mayans.  Yeah.  Running around with stuff in their noses.  Going, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Did you have a throat transplant from a small girl? 
[04:08:00]  No.  Hey, Full Blown Aids has your entire interview, by the way.  Should give them a phone.  Oh.  Anthony on Pal Talk.  They got the entire interview.  It wasn't an interview.  It was like a little Q&A.  It was an interview with the guy from Pal Talk was interviewing.  And then we took questions from the audience.  Fullblownaids.com.  What, Roland?  The Mayans and the...  The Mayans.  Mayans.  Yeah.  It's all subtitled just from their Mayan language, whatever Mel Gibson created. 
[04:08:30]  Mel put a movie in English, again, just leave it.  It's two and a half hours of reading, so you're like, oh.  Reading, yeah.  Are you kidding?  No.  There's no English?  I thought it was just some of that crap going on.  No.  In the man, na capa camila.  Yeah, then...  Wow.  ...y pafula hamaat.  Wow.  They got to run to the wire here, and then they keep on running.  Did you see the passion in his eyes?  No, I didn't.  I was reading.  Yeah, I know.  He's acting.  That's what I hate.  You got to read quickly enough where you can look up to see the scene.  Right.  Like, I was watching Das Boot. 
[04:09:00]  You know?  Great movie.  Of course you are.  But it's a pain in his eyes.  You got to read, and then you got to read real quick, and then look up and see what the  scene is.  But they said the most violent movie ever made is Apocalypto.  Was it?  Ever made.  You saw it.  I haven't seen it.  More violent than Braveheart.  I fell asleep.  More violent than Pride.  Wait, you said it was a good movie.  I said her was good, but I fell asleep.  I was tired.  Oh, you were tired?  Yeah, so.  I didn't have popcorn or anything, so I didn't have it.  More violent than Halloween.  Halloween 6 return of Michael Myers. 
[04:09:30]  That's what they say.  More violent.  The people who are there are like, oh, it's violent, and then the papers.  You really have a PBS voice.  And, you know, sending a donation.  Yeah.  You really do have a sending donation voice.  You get a tote bag for a $50 donation, a tote bag.  I don't know.  You could tote things.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  They're saying it's the most violent Disney movie ever made, which compared to, you know, 
[04:10:00]  I don't know, Toy Story.  It doesn't really.  Days of Thunder.  Make it.  Was that a joke?  Wow.  He goes, Days of Thunder.  Is it more violent than any Tom Savini movie?  Yeah.  Yeah, something like that.  His old school version of horror and blood.  Remember Tom Savini?  Of course.  He was the guy.  The master of the special effect.  He was the guy.  You can't take questions for like 10 minutes.  I know you don't have a meeting.  I mean, we can see right through that. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  I do have to go downtown.  It's so easy to say you have a meeting.  Where downtown?  Hudson Street.  Where are you going?  You're not going to make it there in 15 minutes.  Where are you going to the helium factory where your voice was born?  He's got to get enough helium so he can talk this weekend.  His helium pill.  He's got to go read up on his helium factory.  Oh, my shit.  By the way, yeah, you did miss something at lunch yesterday.  We learned that Roland did a little TV work. 
[04:11:00]  And Sam's got the tape.  Wait a minute.  You were on television?  Yeah, I was on a few times in a different show.  On what?  Carson Daly's show.  And I was on TRL.  But that tape you guys will probably never find.  T-R-L?  Well, but this one he has is a Carson Daly one.  Wait, you said TRL?  You just said TRL.  T-R-L.  You were on TRL?  What?  No.  T-R-L.  Oh, my God.  TRL.  TRL.  He's just like a... 
[04:11:30]  What do you do on TRL?  A little baby bunny.  Yeah.  Exactly.  What do you do on TRL?  You want to carry him around in a basket?  By the way, to really enjoy Roland, watch when his whole face just collapsed.  The whole forehead collapses.  Yeah.  When he gets really like...  The whole forehead just goes...  You have to find out what happened to Roland.  It's something terrible happened to Roland.  Yeah.  Something bad.  What happened, Roland?  You've got to tell me.  Nothing.  Some moment.  Somebody snuck in a room at some point that you was in when you was about eight. 
[04:12:00]  All cherub-like and pudgy.  Yes, something.  Just a sweet kid that was...  Somebody abused a sweet kid.  What happened?  Someone spanked your bottom a little too hard.  Like, Roland is so sweet that, like, if you was a man and kissed him, you wouldn't be gay.  Jesus.  He's almost heterosexually gay.  Like, he's such a sweetie puss. 
[04:12:30]  Oh, Roland.  God bless you.  So, what did you do on TRL?  On TRL.  TRL.  It was during...  Carson hosts the MTV Beach, and he sent me around.  What's going on with Carson, too?  He looks like he has AIDS.  And you had to, what?  That's a little too much weight, right?  It was Timberlake and myself.  We go around just talking to people.  He did.  And I was uncomfortable.  He thought it was funny.  And he goes...  He handed me the mic.  He's right.  So, once I did that, then we came back to New York, and Carson, for his late-night show,  said, we've got to send him away to a trip to Aspen. 
[04:13:00]  And a lot of people wanted it.  He goes, no, we're going to send Roland.  Because he'll fall apart on camera.  Wow.  Yeah.  And Roland has...  And he has to go...  You know where he has to go?  Refill his self-esteem.  Yeah.  As he talks, you can see the self-esteem meter going lower.  And he just...  He probably has an inhaler that he thinks is for animals.  Self-esteem.  But it's a self-esteem inhaler.  Just to get a little...  He's just like, and then I'm talking.  Oh, God.  I'm still talking.  Everybody's looking at me. 
[04:13:30]  Oh, boy.  No confidence in anything he says.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Sam, you saw this tape?  Yes, I did.  And?  Is it gold?  Please say it's gold.  There's some really interesting clips that we'll have fun listening to.  We'll do it on Monday?  Yeah.  Roland also...  I want to see.  He weighed about 120 pounds in 2003.  Well, how much did he weigh now?  Well, he looked like he had my body in 2003.  Oh, sexy.  What happened?  How much weight did he gain since being on TV, you think? 
[04:14:00]  Probably at least 35 pounds, 40.  Because it was different, though.  Because over there, I worked a lot more.  Yeah, probably.  I was doing a remake of Blues Brothers.  Thank you.  Sorry.  I was playing...  I think it was my self-esteem.  Dear Diary.  Yeah.  Roland Belushi.  All of a sudden, he just started shoving food down your mouth, huh?  Oh, sis.  Gained a little weight.  Yeah.  I can't wait to see this.  Yeah, it'll be interesting.  You just want to protect Roland. 
[04:14:30]  Yeah.  Like an endangered species.  You know.  He's the last of his kind.  Just a sweet guy.  Yeah, you'll see me interview celebrities on the tape, too.  You have a significant other?  Who do you have?  Mike Myers, Kevin Smith, Michael McKeon.  Oh, okay.  You have a significant other?  A brother?  Significant other.  Oh, no.  We broke up a while ago.  What was their name?  I'm trying not to insinuate.  Oh, no.  Her name. 
[04:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Good.  Whew.  Heather.  Okay.  Her name was Heather.  Heather.  Just asking.  Graham.  What?  Graham.  No.  No?  Okay.  I just thought if you were going to make up a girl, you might as well make up a real  hot one.  Heather Graham.  It was Graham Heather.  I'm playing Roland.  I don't remember how Roland's feeling.  Yeah.  Everyone knows Don Wicklund's the gay one.  Not you.  Wow.  How did that pan out?  That was hilarious.  Wow.  All right, listen. 
[04:15:30]  We got to go.  All right, Roland.  We should have had you at the beginning of the show when we had her.  Yeah, it's getting late.  Find out more about this 300.  That's fucking...  Yeah.  We want a full report.  That's a good mission.  Find out about the movie.  There's a screening coming up soon for that.  Can we go?  What?  Well, you said you didn't know anything about it.  Well, I got the email for 300.  I haven't seen it.  I haven't read it.  I asked you...  I asked you...  I said, we saw a trailer for the movie 300.  Do you know anything about it?  And you said no.  No.  I don't.  And now you know that there's a screening.  There's all kinds of shit. 
[04:16:00]  It's a...  What do you know about this?  No, I got an invite to go see like a special like half hour clip of it.  Half hour clip?  That'd piss me off.  To see the whole thing.  How's that?  Is that my phone?  Oh, okay.  It's like a special thing.  Oh, your car's probably getting tickets.  All right.  We got to go.  Have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys Monday.  For to listen to Opie and Anthony is more good than to work in the Fruit Roll-Up Factory.  Making the Fruit Roll-Up. 
[04:16:30]  When I was in Russia, we work and make things that are so much better than your American...  Because I...  You know...  What do you...  Let me just...  Well, you already know, but...  You don't want to work.  Work good for you.  Right.  Why you don't want to work?  I was farting so bad, and it stunk so bad.  You fat American.  Right.  Russia is so much better than you, my friend.  I think that would be something that maybe people should need to know.  Okay.  Back to work.
