<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about male fantasies, focusing on the unrealistic aspects of idealized female partners and the comedic impossibility of them ever experiencing weight gain or PMS.  This transitioned into a conversation about women's hairstyles, specifically the "dyke cut," and how women's appearances change over the course of long-term relationships, with numerous callers sharing anecdotes.  The segment included a bizarre story about an elderly woman's unintentionally exposed genitalia while gardening.  A lengthy and highly offensive story about a submarine incident involving civilians and a Japanese trawler, filled with racist and sexist language and stereotypes, followed. Callers shared their own military experiences, further contributing to the offensive tone. The segment concluded with a discussion of Tom Brokaw's supposed interest in *Sex and the City* and a graphic, sexually explicit phone call with a caller named Marco discussing *Queer as Folk*.

The show continued with a detailed review of *Queer as Folk* by guest Marco, who graphically described sex scenes and shared anecdotes about watching the show with friends.  He also discussed his own experiences with assumptions about his sexuality.  Technical difficulties led to a segment featuring Natalie and Dana from the New York Center for Advanced Hair Removal, who performed live laser hair removal on a woman called "Stalker Patty," with Opie and Anthony providing crude and sexually suggestive commentary throughout the graphic procedure.

The broadcast then shifted to a discussion of controversial commercials, focusing on car loan ads and a Delta Airlines ad, perceived as racially stereotypical by some listeners, with several callers offering their opinions.  Comedian Carlos Mencia joined the show, and the conversation covered his comedy, racial stereotypes in his career, and the changing landscape of comedy and political correctness.  Mencia discussed the difficulties of making jokes about different racial groups and the controversies that can arise.

Mencia's appearance continued into the next segment, beginning with a discussion about the dynamics of being a wingman. Mencia then shared humorous anecdotes about his large family, including his father's explanation for having eighteen children and a story about being caught in gunfire as a child.  The conversation explored cultural stereotypes and differences in reactions to perceived injustices across various ethnic groups.  This was followed by a caller making several racially insensitive comments, which were unfiltered.  The show then played a lullaby written by a caller about his divorce, featuring extremely vulgar and sexually explicit lyrics.  A commercial for "Mujan" hair removal followed, with a painful live demonstration. The hosts then engaged in a highly offensive and graphic rant about Regis Philbin's pregnant new co-host, using sexually suggestive and violent language. The segment ended with a caller describing a bizarre injury involving a toilet seat and a plunger.

The final segment started with a "Guess the Substance" game, where callers tried to identify a food product, with the prize being either a *Ben-Hur* DVD or WWF Raw tickets. Opie and Anthony engaged in vulgar banter, with Anthony adopting a dramatic persona.  The show then moved on to a comedic portrayal of a news story about Star Jones's Hamptons barbecue, focusing on the lack of indoor restrooms and the disparity in the menu provided to guests, with the hosts using exaggerated impressions and vulgar jokes about Jones's perceived diva-like behavior.  The segment culminated in a repetitive chant of "I'm a diva."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't stick to.  Who's the bottom?  Please stop.  1-0-2-7-W-N-W.  God, does that booger-eating spas make me want to puke? 
[00:00:30]  I'm pissed off, Rick. How are you?  Hey, bada-bada-bada-bada-bada-sau-whee-tada.  Hey, bada-bada-bada-sau-wing-tada.  You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it.  So, you can get it.  Now we're having fun.  Oh, no.  Be quiet, sir. 
[00:01:00]  There's no crying in face  Is she happy with her large boobs?  It's coming right for us  That's right, the O&A show coming right at you  Good afternoon everybody  Hello  212-757-1027 is our phone number  We should continue our discussion on the air, Anthony 
[00:01:30]  About fantasies  Yes, it came up today at lunch  This all stems from the guy that wanted to bring his wife to his fantasy  Yeah, we talked to him the other day  Had some girls in the studio  And they were asking this guy on the phone some questions  About what he would do in this house with all these naked girls  And he goes, oh 
[00:02:00]  Can I bring my wife?  And we just started lambasting the guy  Because it's your fantasy  It's a fantasy  And this guy is so pussy whipped  That he felt he had to include his wife  Even in his fantasy  We got ourselves a pretty little faggot  We were just amazed  Yeah  Because that's why it's called a fantasy  You can do whatever you want in your fantasy  Right  You don't have to worry about your girlfriend or your wife  Or for you ladies out there  Your boyfriend or husband  That's why they call it a fantasy 
[00:02:30]  You can go wherever you want with it  And he felt compelled to have to ask permission  To take his wife with him  Because she would probably be very pissed off  If she wasn't there for his fantasy  Which just, it leveled me  Yeah, exactly  I couldn't believe somebody could be so pussy whipped  So then today  Well, I don't want to say where we were  Well, it wasn't  I could say this  He wanted me to take  One of my fantasy women 
[00:03:00]  Yeah  Gained a little weight  Put on a couple  And I said, you know what?  That can't happen  Can't happen to a fantasy girl  Right, and everyone's laughing at the table  I'm like, in your fantasy world  Yeah  You can't allow a girl to gain a couple pounds  No  Maybe in real life  Your wife or girlfriend  You know  You give them a little slack  A little fantasy girl  A little leeway, if you will  But in the fantasy world, no  She's got to be perfect 
[00:03:30]  She's got to be perfect  So like  Well  Because you were saying  We all see women  About our daily day  That we consider  You know  Someone we'd like to just  Rail  And you think about that  As your fantasy girl, right?  That is a fantasy girl  Right  And then  She can't have anything  Happening to her  As far as weight  Or a blemish  You know what?  The fantasy girl  She can't even get PMS 
[00:04:00]  No PMS  She doesn't get her period  She doesn't even get bloated  But she's just this perfect  No acne on her face  Nothing  Nothing  She's got to be perfect 24-7  She's just  Because she is your fantasy girl  So you were a little disappointed today  And she can't have that butt that goes  How do we figure that out today?  Okay  Hold your hands  Don't do this if you're driving  Hold your hands  Anthony came up with something that's just brilliant  Well, because we were looking at your fantasy girl 
[00:04:30]  Right  And this is where  And this is what was happening  This is where the problem is  This is where the couple of pounds tacked on  She gained a little weight  On the sides of her butt  Right  The sides of the butt  So I went  Okay, it went from this  What's this, Rick?  Well, show Rick  I know it's a visual  But just by the reaction that Rick makes  You'll understand that this is really, really funny  Okay, try it at home  Okay  Hold your hands out in front of you  And bend at the elbow  So they're up  In front of you  And make like the shape of the sides of an ass 
[00:05:00]  You know  Of a fantasy ass  Where it's kind of like  It has a nice slight curve to it  Like that, right, Rick?  See the curve  Your hands are slightly cupped  As if you were just brushing the sides from her  You know, you get her waist  And then  Almost like your hands are on the side of an hourglass  Right  And you're just a little bit fat  Fingers are pointing up now, people  Oh, yeah  Not straight out  They're pointing up  Watch this  So, and your hands are cupped  You've got that ass  You're going to die  Right  Now, a couple of pounds on the fantasy girl  It does this  Slowly make your hand even more cupped 
[00:05:30]  See?  See what happens?  Yeah, but you do it in such a way  Where you jam your fingers straight down  And it makes a sharp point  It goes like this  See?  You don't want that  You don't want that  Not that  I know it's a visual  But, Rick, how funny is that?  You go from a gentle cup  To almost bending at your knuckles  At almost a 90 degree angle  Because you see these girls in the mall all the time  They've got the jeans on 
[00:06:00]  And all of a sudden their ass gets to a point  Yeah, they're two points  That's sticking out  That's pretty much what Anthony's doing  With his little visual  Making the ass  All of a sudden it's pointed on the side  Pointed  He was doing this  He was doing this at lunch today, though  He had the perfect, you know  Ass with the curve  And then he would go  Then he would  Make the point  Let's go to Adam  Adam, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to know  You're saying that the perfect girl doesn't get PMS 
[00:06:30]  I want to know  Does she go to the bathroom at all either?  Oh, no  No, because the perfect girl doesn't do anything disgusting  She doesn't burp  She doesn't fart  Adam  And no bodily questions either  Unless you're into that  You know, as far as fantasy goes  Well, I'm not  So mine doesn't  See, that's why it's a fantasy  Because, you know, anything goes that you want  Well, she's a perfect 105 pounds  34 C  And not a hair below her head  Does your fantasy girl gain weight  When you're having these fantasies? 
[00:07:00]  Never  Thank you  No  I have two  Mary-Kate and Ashley  Tom, you're next on WNEW  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, buddy  I've got a great gauge for the ass thing that you guys are talking about  Yeah  If you put your two thumbs together  And you put your pinkies out  You make like a W  Okay  And if you put your two thumbs right in the middle  You should be able to fit the sides with your pinkies  Sides with your pinkies?  Like that? 
[00:07:30]  Like if you're looking at her straight from behind  She's got to  The butt's got to fit in that gauge  Oh, I got you  That's like your gauge  It's a little check mark  If it hangs outside the end  It's off, it's done  Now, are you spreading your fingers?  Well, yeah  You know, you don't have to be a little tiny thing  But, like, you know  You can get your hands  All right, you're going a little leeway  What if the points of the side cheek  You know  The points of the side cheek stick out  Oh, it's a gauge, man  It's not perfect  It's a gauge  It's a judgment, you know 
[00:08:00]  Like a benchmark  Just something to work off of  Yeah, you know  I mean, if you've got to do that  And you've got to flip your hands over  To get the other cheek in  You know, she's done  Right  All right, thank you, buddy  All right, man  Bye  Oh, brother  So, we were pretty much discussing  How this girl is no longer part of my fantasy lineup  Because she gained a couple pounds  So, you just throw her to the wayside?  Well, yeah  It's a fantasy  Well, yeah  But what about her  The way you remember her?  No, because I got the last visual of her  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah  So, now she's got the pointy butt 
[00:08:30]  That jets out on the sides  Did she have a freckle behind her knee, brother?  Speaking of him  Calville Bill  He called me at home today  Yeah  He has a story  He said he's going to try to call in today  He's down in Florida for a couple weeks  Yeah  He saw an 80-year-old taint  Oh  Brother, I was ready to  Javier  80-year-old taint 
[00:09:00]  Hey, Jill does  So, I go, come on  How do you see 80-year-old taint?  Right  What is the circumstance  Where you see that area  Between the two  You know what?  Eh, eh, eh  He says that  When the old ladies down in Florida  Yeah  Like gardening and weeding and stuff  Uh-huh  They don't bend at the knees  Oh  They don't bend at the knees?  So, basically  So, they just bend over? 
[00:09:30]  And what was he  And they wear the big muumus to begin with?  Oh, like the house coat with nothing underneath?  Well, I guess there's panties and stuff  But now with the bend  Without bending the knees  Stuff just starts, you know, popping out  Oh  So, he saw an 80-year-old taint  Wow, that's harsh  And he told me today  I was spitting up coffee  I was laughing so hard  That is  Gotta call the show  And tell us about 80-year-old taint  Colin, what's going on? 
[00:10:00]  How you doing?  You're hilarious  Cool  Listen, that guy stuck your thumb  So you got to put his biggies up  It's called the ass caliper  Ass caliper  The ass caliper  Like a caliper for measures  It's called the ass caliper  So, you put your thumbs together  Spread your hands out  Oh, Rick  Like, I'm going to use the ass caliper on you  And then  That's hilarious  It doesn't vary based on how you hold your hand  Yes  It varies on how you hold your hand  How long you  How big your fingers are 
[00:10:30]  It's a gauge for guys  It's a gauge  Yeah, but see  I think you're missing the point  We're just talking about, like, you know  Regular women and fantasy women  And there's no leeway with the fantasy women  They can't be gaining weight on us  And having the PMS  And the bloating and stuff  No  But, like, your lady  You'll give her a little leeway  You understand  Just a little bit  But, you know  No, thank you  I got to get going  Thank you  This guy said he broke his finger  Trying your little trick  Eric, what's up?  Hey, guys  Hey  I just did what you told me to do  You know, with the fingers 
[00:11:00]  Yeah  My hands are locked  I'm very injured  It's kind of hard  You know, you got to go like this  Then you go  Because we're not going for the  You can't really  You said the fingers are pointing upward  Yeah  I'm doing that  I can't unlock my fingers  Slightly cupped  So you make the edges of the ass  Right  Like the hip area  Type below there  And the fingers go straight down  So then it makes that point  The fingers go down  Now you make a point  You're not bending at the fingers  Because that's too easy  You just  There it is  Get your fingers straight  And you bend at your knuckles 
[00:11:30]  Why don't you put it on the  Not this bad  Maybe we'll have to take some digital pictures  And show people how it's done  On that 80 year old taint  Yeah  I'm sure she was wearing a sundress  With nothing on it  There'll be a better way to describe it  Thank you, bro  If her ass looks like the Joker's smile  Because that's kind of what I'm doing  With my fingers here  Wait till they get a load of meat  Then there's a problem  Well, you broke that out at lunch today, man  That's classic 
[00:12:00]  Lewis  Because the fantasy girl was there  Lewis  Oh, thanks a lot, guys  You know, only 10 minutes to show  And let's see  I've broken my wrist  Trying to do that trick with the fingers  And I just heaved into the dumpster  Thanks to the taint  That's 106 years old  80 years old  80 years old  Oh, well, 80 years old  Big difference  Lewis, very popular on the message board  Yeah, I know  Thank you, Lewis  Take care, dude  All right  Bye  They hate him  It's hysterical  The difference between 80-year-old taint  And 106-year-old taint  There's still some elaticity to the taint 
[00:12:30]  Elaticity to the 80-year-old taint  106  There's none left  Hell no  No, I think in both cases  It's kind of like that rubber band  You find behind your car seat  It just kind of goes  Crumbles  Yeah, and you stretch it out  It just breaks  There's nothing left  Nothing  It's just dust  Knocks out  Done  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, old  Yeah  The fantasy girl  Yeah  Would you rather give up a little bit of the body  Over the ears or the face?  No, man  Fantasy girl is what it is 
[00:13:00]  They're like the Sports Illustrated swimsuit models  Yeah, but  They don't give up anything  They got everything's perfect  But if you had to give up something  Would you give up the body a little bit  Or the face?  That's his point  That's his point  You don't have to  You don't have to  Do you guys have fantasies?  Yeah  Are you bringing my wife?  Are you bringing your wife to your fantasy?  Oh, no  What am I, a moron?  Can I bring my lawyer to my fantasy?  No  I understand what you're saying  Doug, when you're having one of those moments  And your fantasy girl is in your dreams  All of a sudden  She's getting uglier? 
[00:13:30]  No, I understand what you're saying  Now, okay  Now, relax  Take it easy  All right  I'm just asking  Imagine you're sitting there just like  I gotta get out of this fantasy  What's it gonna take?  This girl turned into a raving bitch  Thank God  She doesn't shut up  She doesn't shut up  She cut her hair all short in the dyke cut  What are they doing that for?  We gotta get Jay on the phone  He has a whole bit on that  On the girls that cut their hair into the dyke cut  After you hook up with them  Pretty much what Jay says  Our good friend from Boston 
[00:14:00]  He goes  There are couples that are married for a while  When they met  You know, they both were thin and in shape or whatever  They look better, let's say  And then the years go by  And let's say your wife  She's now your wife  You know, she kept her hair nice and long  How you met her and stuff  Or that nice hairstyle  But slowly but surely  The hairstyle changes  And gets shorter and shorter and shorter  And, you know, one morning  You wake up  And your wife looks like your buddy Bob  Right  Like a man  He's got  Yeah, he  Might as well call him a he at this point 
[00:14:30]  She's got a guy's haircut  She just gave up  And somewhere in there  You're like, where did it all go wrong?  When did you give up?  I was married to a woman  Now she looks like my friend Pete  You ever see that?  What the hell is  They just cut it off  And it's really short on the sides  Short on top  And then their explanation sometimes is  Well, it's just easier this way  Right  I didn't hook up with easy  No  Well, yeah, kind of  Kind of did  I didn't hook up with easy 
[00:15:00]  Like maintenance  With a chick like that, you know  Yeah  As the guy  You would say  What the hell are you doing?  Right  It's not like all of a sudden  But see, it's the guy's fault though  Because you saw the signs coming  I mean, she was cutting it  And it's shorter every year  Oh, and what are you going to do?  Say something bad about the girl's appearance?  Well  You got to like step in  Before it's too late  It's a new can of worms, Hopi  What's worse?  Cutting it short on top  Or letting it go down below?  That probably goes hand in hand  Because a girl that would cut her hair on her head  Because it's easier to deal with 
[00:15:30]  Yeah  Isn't cutting down below  Because it's easier to just let it rock and roll down there  Let it ride  So before you know it  You're with a wookie down below  Let your freak flag fly  Tony, what's going on?  What's up, O&A?  Hey  Thanks, Wild Bill Hilcock  For that friggin' taint story  Wild Bill Hilcock  Yeah, Wild Bill Hilcock's not even here  And he's grossing everyone out  Hey, brother  I saw 80-year-old taint  I think what he said was  He'll tell the story when he gets back  And I'm like, you know what? 
[00:16:00]  It's too good  We got to go on the radio with it  Yeah  He's coming back in like two weeks  We got the visual  We need the story  Yeah  All right, dude  Quick story for you  My ex-girlfriend goes away to Cancun  I'm with her  Longhead down to her ace  Comes back home  She has the effin' Dorothy Hamill  Bullhead head cut  I said, what's next?  You gonna grow a mustache  And get tattoos?  You friggin' gas gobbler?  The Dorothy Hamill cut  It happened  She went from supermodel to super dyke 
[00:16:30]  You see those couples around all over the place  Where all of a sudden the woman has like really short hair  I'm sitting there like, how is that attractive?  And all the girls that she gets together with  That all have the same haircut  They just compliment each other  So that they think it's good  Because it's good in their little circle  But believe me, no guy is looking at that going  Yeah, that's the cut  That's the one I like  No-name guy  After ten years  Wife cut her hair like a guy  See?  Yeah  Alright, what's up, buddy?  Anthony  Hopi 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  Out of ten years  It's one thing if it's your girlfriend  Because you could always dump her  But ten years with kids  One day it's good  The next day, bobs  Like a bob cut  You know what I mean?  Like right behind  You know the back of the neck?  The back?  Yeah  It goes up on an angle a little bit  Yeah  That's what I got to contend with now  Oh, you got like  It's like a little weird wedgie thing happening  Exactly  He recently diked out  Nothing better than the DA on a girl  Exactly  That's good  You're tagging her from behind  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da 
[00:17:30]  Thank you very much for that  What am I going to do?  Now she looks like  She could be one of your friends from behind, right?  Thank you very much  Well  All right, man  All right, thanks  I'm telling you  We hit on a nerve  Fred, what's up  Hey, guys  What's going on?  Hey  I used to go away  Like for three weeks at a time  But I was married  And so, you know  Call home and check in  And say, what's going on  She's like  Yeah, I want to get my hair cut.  Like, okay, you know, it was down below her shoulders.  It was kind of nice.  I came back.  I thought I was married to a dyke.  It was just awful. 
[00:18:00]  Anne went behind her.  I called her Bob.  She might as well be in prison, but she couldn't have the sense of humor.  She used to anymore.  No, they love it.  It's easy.  It's so easy to take care of now.  It only takes five minutes to shampoo and condition.  Well, but it's nice and flowing, but now it's like, yo, Butchie, what's up?  Let's go play some cuts.  There you go.  All right, Fred, thanks.  Have a good day, guys.  Ladies, if you learn anything today, keep your hair nice and long.  You know what's even worse?  When they do get it cut and they get it buzzed in the back, and then you go and touch it,  it feels like a crew cut. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, that's what you want.  When you're running your fingers through your chick's hair so it feels like a crew cut.  Believe me, girls, there's plenty of times.  If you live long enough, you're all going to end up with that big, puffy, white cotton head.  Like every, every old lady out there.  So why blow it early by getting your hair cut short?  You know grandmas.  Either that, because there's only two hairdos for old women.  There's the big, puffy, cotton one, and then the scary, witch, gray, long, straight hair.  That looks so great on old women. 
[00:19:00]  You have a, whatever, I wouldn't say.  What?  There's something like, I don't know, attractive about that.  About what?  The straggly, gray, long hair?  You know they're old, but you're like, okay, at least, you know, she's still trying.  She's a goer, right?  Oh, she goes because she's got the long hair?  Hell, man.  I don't know.  I think you guys are looking at this from one angle.  But think about it this way.  When a girl cuts her hair that short, you don't have to worry about holding the hair out of the way anymore? 
[00:19:30]  Oh, please.  Like, that's a problem?  Well, you know, I mean, no.  And now you're nitpicking.  It's a little more convenient.  It's a little more convenient.  Yeah, that's a problem.  Let's put it or it's crunchy and let's rock.  You know?  I mean, but cut my hair off.  I would rather she looks like it's my friend going down on me.  Joe, there's not...  Oh, my God.  God.  Well, Joe, think about it.  You don't get hair in the way in a glory hole either.  It also depends on the girl.  I mean, if you're thinking about, like, Giselle Bündchen with, you know, with a real short haircut, who cares? 
[00:20:00]  Is that why you cut your hair, Joe, to keep the hair out of the way?  John, what's going on?  Yeah, listen.  By the time they get their hair cut that short, you don't have to hold it out of the way no more because they ain't doing that no more.  So your equation, short hair equals no more and.  Remember that equation for what did we learn today.  Thank you.  Okay.  All right, let's get a few ladies on the air.  Veronica.  Veronica, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  Hi.  I'm working on a ladder and you guys are, like, making me nearly fall off this thing.  I'm laughing so hard. 
[00:20:30]  A ladder.  One way for guys to make sure that ladies groom downstairs is to keep ladies happy downstairs.  That way that doesn't get too long.  And, you know, if you're happy, you're going to do what your husband wants.  So that's another equation.  Keep your hair longer and pretty and, you know, pay attention to the ladies.  So keep the lady happy downstairs and she'll keep it nice and trim.  Yeah, yeah, big whoop.  No one cares.  No one cares.  I thought you guys were just complaining. 
[00:21:00]  You're a girl.  I love that one.  Thank you, Veronica.  That's a whole new argument there.  We're not talking about girls that aren't being sexually satisfied or guys that aren't or couples.  It's just, this is plain and simple.  What about when you're dating and stuff and, like, you bring, like, that girl home from the bar and stuff and it's like unwrapping a package.  You don't know what you're going to get down below and sometimes you're horrified.  You look like a food rack full of afro hair. 
[00:21:30]  You know what I'm saying, though?  Because, I mean, you like it one, maybe a couple different ways.  And if it's not one of those ways and you unwrap the present, you're like, good God.  What's that, Fidel Castro spitting out some Hubba Bubba?  Oh, it's not even that.  It's the couple of beers.  All of a sudden, you know, the jeans come off and you're like, oh, a penis.  Right, Rick?  Oh, very good. 
[00:22:00]  Oh.  All right, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  We leave you.  Now with the sounds of Montana.  And me making my face look like a glazed donut.  Before I get back to my wife.  The sounds of the elusive bearded clam. 
[00:22:30]  Me trying to shuck the hell out of that bearded clam.  I usually don't say things like that, but I'll leave you this Sunday morning with the sounds of me giving her the old pile trial.  So now, pictures and sounds of me and the pile trial.  On my mistress in Montana. 
[00:23:00]  On the road.  The road I prefer.  Pictures now of the Hershey Highway.  Visited that in Montana.  Launched the Hershey Highway.  My wife often thought I was fishing on my trips to Montana.  And it's true I was.  Here's the sound of the trouser trunk.  Coming out of my trousers as I pound some ass. 
[00:23:30]  And now the sounds of me pounding ass with my Montana crotch rat.  We leave you now.  The sounds of me and my mistress and me shooting a tray up in that piece.  And now, finally, the sounds of my mistress hobbing my knob. 
[00:24:00]  We don't often leave you with the sounds of knob-hobbing.  I figure this is a good time to leave.  And now the sounds of me and my knob being hob.  Charles Kuralt on the road.  Hob-knock.  Now the sounds of the Purple Helmet Warrior.  Going into battle again.  Against the dreaded bearded clan. 
[00:24:30]  Montana crotch rat.  There's the Montana crotch rat.  God, I wish she shaved.  A little personal hygiene in the groin area.  So it wouldn't look so much like a possum.  That woman looks like roadkill.  Looks like the last time I saw a woodchuck caught in a combine.  Red and brown and whatnot. 
[00:25:00]  Now the sounds of a woodchuck being caught in a combine.  Leave you.  I mentioned she looks like she had Einstein's head in a leg lock.  It's a trim nut.  First time I've made love to her.  Pulled those panties down and looked like Fidel Castro eating a London broil.  I used to have a lot of sex in my car. 
[00:25:30]  I gave her a Spanish fly once.  I found her on the gear shift.  Now the sounds of my girlfriend on the gear shift.  We'll leave you.  Yes.  I just wish she was a little better with the hygiene.  It sort of looked like when you take two big pieces of silly putty, slap them together and throw them in the floor of a barbershop.  All pink and hairy. 
[00:26:00]  Something crazy is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play with some of my fans?  Something very, very wrong with us.  What's a little confusion with the delinquency of a minor.  The Olfee and Anthony show.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  1027 WNEW is...  1027 WNEW is...  The Sports Guys at 5 a.m. 
[00:26:30]  The Radio Chick at 9.  Ron and Fez at noon.  Opie and Anthony at 3.  Don and Mike at 7.  Next time, on a very special Ron and Fez, where we're looking for the ultimate New Yorker.  It's your chance to win $10,000 by listening to Ron and Fez.  Fez, did you know that before its renovation, the landmark ceiling at Grand Central Station hadn't been cleaned since 1944?  Gee, Ron, that reminds me.  What?  My underwear's due for a renovation.  You disgusting pig.  I said landmark, not skidmark. 
[00:27:00]  Listen for details on how you can become the ultimate New Yorker and win $10,000, courtesy of jackpot.com and Ron and Fez, now in midday.  Ron and Fez, middays, noon to 3, 1027 WNEW.  She was on the news.  Huh.  The submarine thing.  That's the...  That's a pretty... 
[00:27:30]  That's a pretty wacky story.  It's getting better and better every day, too.  Well, like I said, new details come out every day.  They just trickle a few things out.  I'm sure the military would love to just keep everything quiet with this thing, but they can't.  There were civilians on board the sub, and they were off of Hawaii, somewhere in the Pacific,  and they did one of those power surface maneuvers they do,  where they just blow the ballast tanks, and the thing comes up like a fish, doing that, like a dolphin. 
[00:28:00]  And, uh, oops, Jap Trawler was right above him.  You could say Jap, uh, Rick.  It was an acceptable term back in the 40s.  So was colored, but I guess we can't use Jap.  You can use Jap.  Jap Trawler.  I hate political...  In the water.  It wasn't Chinese.  It was...  Rick, they were Japs.  Rick writes Chinese.  Look at how politically incorrect you are.  I don't care.  They're just chinks.  They have slanty eyes.  They have slanty eyes. 
[00:28:30]  It's all the same.  That was a Jap Trawler.  And the sub comes up, and, uh...  What luck?  The sub came up right underneath the boat.  Oh!  Sunk it in, like, nine minutes.  Now, it just sounded at first, like, oh, that's tragic, you know?  The sub comes up.  Then, it turns out, there were some civilians on board.  The sub.  But they said...  Yeah, on board the sub.  Yeah.  But they said they weren't near any of the controls or anything.  Then it comes out that one guy is at the helmsman's station, but there were, like, soldiers or, uh, the seamen behind them. 
[00:29:00]  You said seamen.  Then both posts up by the helm were taken by civilians.  Then it turns out, it seems, every post was manned by a civilian, but there were, uh, one of the guys that was supposed to be stationed there, right behind him watching.  The guy that actually did the, uh, ballast blow maneuver was a civilian.  He, he pulled the lever.  So, they said they checked.  They looked through the periscope.  They did their sonar check. 
[00:29:30]  The sonar check, an hour before, showed the boat.  It was there.  They knew it was there.  Then the sonar guy left.  They're saying he was distracted by, oh, a civilian on board.  Whoops.  Yeah.  Oops.  Oops.  Uh, here's my theory.  Uh, they're having a little fun.  They've got some civilians on board they want to show.  Does your theory have anything to do with O.J. killing anyone?  Yes.  O.J. was working the captain's head because he had cut it off like a puppet.  Of course, reverting back to the... 
[00:30:00]  Stop it, this ship.  Who cares about the slanty-eyed bastard?  It's O.J. and Joel.  Reverting back to the beginning of the show.  Okay.  Go ahead.  So, uh, I'm thinking some civilians on board.  You want to show off a little bit?  You're commanding a sub.  You got all the guys in there.  Wouldn't it sound close to like, hey, watch this.  We are going to pop up in front of this trawler and scare the bejesus out of these, uh, Japs.  Just watch.  It's going to be great.  For a goof.  For a goof.  Imagine that.  You're sitting in a trolley.  You're like, oh, very good.  We learned our fish. 
[00:30:30]  We learned our put net in water.  Bring up a flipper.  And a flipper, seers, and other things that Americans find cute and don't want cute.  Bring up a net.  And then, uh...  So for a chuckle, why not?  Imagine that though.  You're just out in the water.  And for a goof.  And you would S your pants on the spot.  Oh, my God.  You're just sitting there.  All of a sudden, this huge submarine comes flying out of the water in front of you.  Godzilla!  Oh, no!  Godzilla!  Oh, no!  Oh, no! 
[00:31:00]  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  Run!  All right.  Sorry.  Continue.  You know, just scare the hell out of him.  Be a goof. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  But, uh, since the sonar guy wasn't right there, I guess they figured, well, it's got to be close  by.  It can't be right over us.  Oops!  Wrong, no!  Right over him!  And, uh, took a big chunk out of it and it sunk in like nine minutes.  A bunch of people have died.  A bunch of people have died.  A lot of people lived though.  No.  There were some survivors.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Water is so cold!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  I'm your Hordan! 
[00:32:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  I'm your Hordan to you!  Chang!  Hordan Chang!  You would've been the last afternoon!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Um!  Little tiny wrist.  What, what said I hear.  It's it my third, which of the icy waters have put me in their daze.  Is that serene D'Ande?  That huge camera toe in the side of our boat.  That huge camera toe in the side of our boat.  When we get to America,  you will be in the Yankee Cranky shop, 
[00:32:30]  or in their surrounds,  or work at sushi restaurants.  What the hell was that?  It was so nice when you draw me on the ship.  You like a naked drawing I do of you?  You like a naked picture? 
[00:33:00]  Yes, but why do you make a rag so short and ass so frat?  That's how you look.  You all look that way.  Ring there.  I am the emperor of the world.  This is a short movie.  Nine minutes wrong, and we stop.  Crap.  Not even time to send up a frat. 
[00:33:30]  Not even time to whip up a frat around.  Yoshi on board.  Yoshi on board.  Yoshi go both ways.  Chinese and Japanese.  Oh, we all went in the water.  Boat went down nine minutes.  That's when sharks come cruising.  I guess about seven o'clock first ones came.  They start there pounding and pounding. 
[00:34:00]  You hear high-pitched screaming and harrowing.  Horroring.  But they just keep pounding and pounding.  Riferous eyes like a geisha girl's eyes.  Whoever you are, I believe that's the heart of the world.  So I need a rocking chair once.  I will not stand by as you perform something out of a half-half-half autopsy on a piece. 
[00:34:30]  I won't stand here while you cut that thing open and watch that little tongue whang, boy, fall out all over the dock.  A rice bird dead ahead.  What a tragedy.  Uh-oh.  Shots come cruising.  I'll never put on a rife jacket again. 
[00:35:00]  Are you ready to go back?  Shots come cruising.  Shots come cruising.  Jigsaw.  Look like a big hand roll.  Compose.  Caves go in the water.  Can't sign go in the cage.  Farewell in the door.  Do you fear? 
[00:35:30]  Can't sign my lady.  And amazing.  As the ship went down, the band kept praying and praying.  The band prayed on.  Many died that day.  But there were some far-fiveers.  I dedicate this song to the brave men and women of the S.S. Chang-Fan. 
[00:36:00]  Swang Yintze.  Swang Yintze 1.  Swang Yintze 1.  Swang Yintze 1.  King shang Yintze 1.  Chang Yintze 1.  A mission of the S.S.A.  Very dishonorable.  Sub came out of the water, I crapped myself  Very dishonorable  Let's go to the phone side 
[00:36:30]  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey  Every time we had civilians on board, we used to go crazy showing off  Wait, you were on one of those subs?  Yeah, I did eight years on a ballistic missile sub  So you would show off on the civilian  This one's great  So you would show off for the civilians, what would you do?  Well, we used to do what they called angles and dangles  We used to go down really fast and go deep and then pull it back up  And one time we had such an upward angle that we lost all our navigations 
[00:37:00]  Everything went offline because we had too steep of an angle  Ah, who cares?  All right  It's like, ah, what a ride  Who cares? We need navigation  It's the sea, there's nothing out here  Watch the civilians arrest themselves  They used to be crazy  Oh, that's funny  You horarius  Very funny  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Crack the fourth open right fortune cookie  What up?  Hey, man, I was in here for four years  And when you come back from Hawaii, it's like San Francisco  It's called a Tiger Cruise 
[00:37:30]  And you can bring like three of your family members to ride on board  And you got little kids driving the ship  You got the old Sheriatrics  Oh, my God, it's great  This is great  What did you do?  Oh, no!  How long is Don Wesker the way before we start selling pieces of the trawler on the home shopping?  Yeah  All right, buddy  Let's go to Chuck  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, I was in the military for four years  They let my father drive an aircraft carrier  He's a phone man  A phone man 
[00:38:00]  Come on, is that true, though, Brian?  Yeah, man  They, like the guy said, man  They take you from Hawaii to San Diego, where I was stationed  And on the way back, they do a bunch of tours  They took him up to the bridge  The guy watched him  And there he is  He's got pictures and everything  Him steering a thousand-foot, billion-dollar aircraft  Look, I'm driving  What's that?  All right, guys, you rule  All right  Later  Tragedy 
[00:38:30]  I see  Who?  Who's driving both?  Who's driving submarines?  It's Eric Cartman  Rudy, what's going on?  1982, I was running a 148-foot supercruiser off Montauk Point  About 100 people on board  We had a submarine come up right in front of us  That's great  And I know I shit myself 
[00:39:00]  Oh, hey, oh, hey, oh, hey  Hold on, hold on  So a submarine came up in front of your boat  And you crapped yourself  Yeah  That's got to be intense looking  We're doing about 26, 28 knots on a 148-footer  I do believe we have audio from that day  It's got to run for us  No  How close was it?  Came up about within 100 yards  Had my feet up  You've got to think they do that crap on purpose 
[00:39:30]  Because they're bored out there  That's not  They're supposed to put up a warning before they come up  All right, thank you  All right  All right  Japsub, slam two torpedoes into our side  Pay back a bitch  If I knew that would happen  I'd turn around  Chief, what's going on?  You guys make me rock so hard  I'm going to drop crouching tiger in my kimono  Let's go to Marianne  Marianne, what's going on?  Hey guys, how are you?  Good  I just called because I knew I kept my mouth shut long enough 
[00:40:00]  About wanting to hear some Yoshi bits  That he'd eventually turn up somewhere  And there he was on the fishing ship  Who knew?  Yeah, Yoshi on the Titanic  I was just delivering some time  My little bicycle on the deck of boats  I was going to peddle back to Manhattan  Oh, that's my thing  I love you, Jack  Yes, I know you rubbed me 
[00:40:30]  Just printing up room on that door you're floating on  I never understand why you won't rent me on  And then when we all die  We end up back on Japanese trara  All young again  Waiting for another submarine  Very good 
[00:41:00]  Very touching tribute to those people  God damn  Oh, the sugar stayed down to the race  Oh, they were hit with a boatload of semen too  Well, they was  They're all as skinny as olives  Look at the chinks  That's what he is  Rob, what's up?  Hey guys, how's it going? 
[00:41:30]  Good, man  Anyhow, I was in Coronado  I was coming back on a tiger cruise on Destroyer  About 400 guys or so  We let somebody's  The captain's father actually drive the ship  So we're coming through underneath the Coronado bridge  And this other boat was coming right for us  Coming right for us?  It's coming right for us  So anyhow, we're coming right through it  And the captain goes  You know, we're telling the captain  He's getting a little close  And he says, no, he'll move  This guy's coming right for us  And sure enough, they hit us  The whole thing goes all the way down  So now we stop the ship 
[00:42:00]  Now we stop the ship  And then we stop  Everything comes in  Everybody comes over  Trying to get this guy out  But it is a true fact  They do let people  Drive the ships on a tiger cruise  That's just amazing  Yeah  I guess it happens every time  But when they come up  And nail a Japanese trawler  It's pretty bad  All they would have had to do  Is feed some spinach to the ship  Right in the engine  Would have kicked the sub's ass  Wait a minute  Hey Stinkski, load up my bowl 
[00:42:30]  Wayne, what's up?  Hey man, listen  I was in the Navy  During Nam  And I remember  Being at sea  In the North Atlantic  And firing salvo rounds  Over top of a rushing  Fishing ship  Just for the hell of it  Because, you know  They were out there  And we were firing rounds  Over top of them  They were on the radio  Talking back to us  In Russia  We had no idea  What they were doing  I was on the quarter deck  Listening to this  Were you on the weed?  Were you on the weed? 
[00:43:00]  Listening to Jimi Hendrix music  Blasting and firing rounds  Hendrix a little bit  You know  Hendrix a little bit  Of deep purple  You know  You take away  All the death and destruction  Nam just looked like  One big party  It was under  Some cool equipment  And plenty of drugs  And nice rock music  I swear to God  You know  And you know  As long as you still talk  Like you live in the 70s  People leave you alone  I swear to God, man  All right, Wayne  Thank you  All right  Let's take a break  Bye  212-757-1027

[01:35:00]  And I'm like, oh, my God  Who the hell would go there?  You know, it's funny to me  The sauce  Just like Aunt Millie made  It's funny to me  Because through the whole commercial  They said, how do you keep your man?

[01:38:00]  She's getting rid of Cox?  She's getting rid of Cox, yes  Huh  She doesn't like Cox anymore  Why?  Well, she wants to use her husband's name  She's married to David Arquette  Right  Courtney Arquette  So she wants to be called Courtney  Yeah, Arquette  She wants to drop Cox  Well, she liked Cox  Well, I guess she liked it for a while  Yeah  They were  It was very good for her  And her career  But  Yeah, for her career  I would think she would  You know 
[01:38:30]  Hold on to Cox  I wouldn't think  She would just  I'm just not  I think you're right  If her professional  Cast Cox to the wayside like that  Sure  Well, she's moving on with her career  Without Cox  Hmm  So  All right  Sans Cox  Mm-hmm  Why?  Why?  I don't know why everyone's giggling  I don't know either  Something  If a girl wants to change her name  It's fine  I just  Sure  Find it a little odd  That  She's been treated well by Cox  For so many years 
[01:39:00]  Mm-hmm  That she would just  Dump it like that  She's brave enough  To live her life without Cox  I guess so  So  Arquette  Arquette  Courtney Arquette  Courtney Arquette  For now on  Not a hyphen  Cox no more  Right  Huh  That old gag  You know  I actually felt the downward spiral  In that bit  Oh, sure  Of course  Of course you did  That's what you're supposed to feel  There's no lifeboat  Oh, the other thing 
[01:39:30]  We have to mention  Is the book  That's coming out on Reagan  Really?  Mm-hmm  And it looks like  President Reagan  Didn't like Bush  Really?  Right  Reagan didn't like Bush  Really?  Did he like Cox?  Or did he drop Cox?  Courtney?  I mean  Well, would he know  About Cox  Back in 81?  Um, sure  I think at that point  During his presidency  She was on that  Bruce Springsteen video 
[01:40:00]  Right?  So he was  Dancing in the Dark  So he was well aware of Cox  At that point  Cox was on the stage  Just shaking  And, you know  Remember?  Gyrating Cox  Sure  We saw her  She was dancing  He forgot all about the Cox  But the Bruce  Alright, so  Yeah, this book is claiming that  Yeah, you figure it doesn't work  The first time  It's like putting sour milk in the fridge  You go  Nope, still bad  It's the O&A show 
[01:40:30]  212-757-1027  I am so psyched  To have Carlos Mencia  On our radio show, Anthony  Yeah  I've been jamming to your CD  Jamming  Whatever  But, you know  Listening to the latest  Carlos Mencia CD  Is hilarious  That's pretty cool, man  Alright, so be funny  It's cool that 
[01:41:00]  Believe it or not, man  It's cool that it's like  White guys saying that  You know  I swear to God, man  I'm in Texas so much  It's always, you know  Some Spanish  Half English  You know what I mean?  Stay  You've got to go see him, man  And he's one of our people  You know what I mean?  It's like not even  It's not even he's funny at this point  It's just, you know  Out of loyalty toward the cause  Support the cause  Support the beaner  Yeah  If you don't go out  To see the beaner  Then people aren't going to eat beans  And then the people  Who plant beans 
[01:41:30]  Aren't going to make any money  And then what's going to happen  To us?  You know what I mean?  It's like the whole circle of life  For the beaners, man  Oh, right on  I must say  He came in here  And he figured it out  Who's Opie  And who's Anthony  Yeah, most brain surgeons  Can't figure that out  Most people can't figure it out  Well, I had a friend with my friends  You know, I'd go  Opie and Anthony  I'd go, you know  It's a white guy, an Italian guy  My stupid friend from Miss Deli  Oh, come on, dude  Anthony doesn't  Like, it doesn't really have to be  An Italian guy  Like, Julio doesn't have to be a beaner  Shut up, stupid 
[01:42:00]  If it was a white guy  It'd be like Tony  Not Anthony  Anthony is like Italian, man  Yeah, true  Yeah, you're right  If it's Tony, maybe  But Anthony  When you think  When you hear a guy say  Hey, my name's Anthony  It always comes  See, I can't even say Anthony  Like, it's got  Hey, I'm Anthony  You know, it's got to come out like that  Of course, of course  So, you know  I never liked the Tony name, though  Because it always came off like  Tony was always the  Tony's like the retarded brother  Jindo friggin', you know  Hey, hey, come on, huh? 
[01:42:30]  We're going to go out tonight  Hey, he's the retarded one  Have a good time, Mom  Tony, you mother  And I'm like  I don't want to be  I'll be Anthony  He's a little more refined  Yeah, Tony's the one that says  Words like  Doot-doot  And everybody  Doot-doot  You know what I mean?  Yeah, that guy's a  Doot-doot  What is that?  You know, it made me feel like  I'm not an American  You know what?  Is that some new word  In the Western?  Doot-doot  Yeah  No clue, man  Yeah  It's fun  It's fun to go out, though, man 
[01:43:00]  I mean, it's like  It's been such a long  It's been such a long journey for me  Just to be considered  Like, funny  You know what I mean?  We saw you years ago  You're hilarious  Yeah, but it's always like  The Beener thing first  Not with you guys  I'm just saying like  Wherever I go  It's always like  Well, you don't see many  Beener comics  Well, you know  I agree  But you know what it is?  It's just that  There's black comics  And white comics  And this and that  But not many Mexican comics 
[01:43:30]  I think they cling  Or Puerto Ricans  Or whatever  But they cling to it  Is what it is  You know what I mean?  They cling to that whole  You know  Puerto Ricans this  And Mexicans this  And white people that  And they just do that  Yeah  Over and over again  You know what I mean?  It's like that movie  What's that new movie  Where the white girls  Dating the black guy?  Ah, yeah  The black friends  Are hating on her  And, you know  And I'm just like  Does that s***  Really happen anymore?  Wait, wait, wait, wait  No, but I mean  Does it really happen? 
[01:44:00]  Like, do I  Dude, my chick  Is like from Oregon  She is the whitest thing  Like, my chick  Should be going out  With you  Okay, that's why  Do you know what I mean?  Like, when you see my chick  You know  That dude is successful  In something  You know what I'm saying?  Or he's a pimp  Because this chick  Is just  Carlos, the funny thing is  We should swap  Because my girl  Is the girl from Puerto Rican  She's going out  With a Puerto Rican girl  Do they ever look  At you weird, though?  I never get it  The family does  Her family? 
[01:44:30]  A little bit  Maybe  But, you know  What's funny  Is that I've encountered that  Like, you know  What I mean?  That white people  Are usually much more  Willing to be like  It's cool  You know what I mean?  It's like the ethnic side  That's usually a little  You know  Hey, man  I'll come here  They didn't  But, you know  My girl  So, like  My father  Was just like  You know  Does she have a  How does her mother look?  You know  My dad was in with that, man  It's just  I don't see it  I go everywhere  Dude, I've been in Birmingham, Alabama  In the middle of the night  At this place called 
[01:45:00]  The Waffle House  With a bunch of rednecks  Yeah, the old Waffle House  And I walk in  And I've never ever  Like, had that look like  What the hell  Is that Bainer doing  With our people?  You know  I've never seen it  All of a sudden  There's a movie about it  And they're trying to make it  Like, it's America  You know  The struggles  And the white  And the black  You know  We're bringing the racial issue  And I'm  I was like  Didn't I see that  Like, back in  Like, 1970  Although the sisters  Do get upset  When they see a brother  With a white chick  Yeah, but that's only because 
[01:45:30]  That's only because  Like, political correctness  Has gone to the point where  You know what?  You turn on Oprah, right?  And then you see a black guy  Dating a white girl  And all the audience  Was like, oh  And LaQuisha was like  Damn  Why you gotta be leaving us?  Why you gotta be going with a white girl?  It has nothing to do with the fact  That you got two  And each breast that you have  Weighs 300 pounds  It has nothing to do with the fact  That your fat ass  Looks the way it does  Nothing to do with that, of course  While the white girl is hot  You know  It's not like she's so fat 
[01:46:00]  I want my Tyrone  Every night  It's not like that  You know  She's a hot chick  They're dancing her  But then fat ass LaQuisha  Comes out  A retarded white dude  With, you know  With one tooth  And a polio hat  You go, LaQuisha  You go, girl  That's right  That's right, girl  You bring on that  Black love magic  Bring it on, girl  You know  It's so  Like you can say  As long as you're dissing  White people  In America 
[01:46:30]  You're cool  You know what I mean?  Same thing you want  About white people  It's cool  You say black  All of a sudden  You know what I mean?  We go through that  On our show  I know you do  We make fun of everything  But as soon as you make fun of  You know  A Puerto Rican  Or a black guy  Or something  The phones explode  We were just talking  We opened up the show today  Talking about Jesse Jackson  And we got calls  From people going  Why do you have to  Make this a race issue?  We didn't even bring  I think people know 
[01:47:00]  Jesse's black  We brought up the fact  That he couldn't keep  His ding in his pants  And he got a chick pregnant  But then all of a sudden  It's like  Well, now you're talking  About Jesse  So we're going to get  Flack from that  Because he's a black guy  Right  No  Can't talk about Jesse  Because he's a hit  Stay out the bushes  That's what you should have done  Stay out the bushes  I think it's hilarious  Man  It really is great  People love this  But it's funny  Because here's a guy  Who's like walking around  Telling everybody  How to be righteous 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah  You know what I mean?  Well, the whole time  And the only reason  Why he got it  He put the story out  Is because they caught him  And they were going to  Put it on like  The Enquirer  Yeah  So it's not like  The guy actually came out  And said, you know  Whatever  Like Jesse, we got you  Yeah, he was forced  To say something  He was forced to do it  And this guy was  Counseling Clinton  When Clinton was  Going through his thing  This chick was  Four months pregnant  In the picture  There's a picture  Of her next time  She's four months pregnant  While he's counseling him  But I think what he's  Telling him is  Is the bitch pregnant?  I think that's 
[01:48:00]  What he was talking about  I don't think  He was counseling him  Well, he was telling him  Listen, this is what you do  Give him $10,000  Keep him quiet, man  He did say  Clinton said he felt better  After Jesse left  After the talk  Because Jesse probably  Did go  Hey, man  You could be me  Look  Yeah, exactly  This bitch is pregnant  Yeah, exactly  And I brought her  Just so you could look at her  Yeah, that's probably  What he did, man  I want you to know  I got her pregnant  I'm not in a  Circumstance  Is I  I want to hear

[01:49:00]  Right now at work  Who have their radios  Really, really low  Yeah  Especially right now  Because, you know  We're talking about race  Sure  Well, whatever happened  To freedom of speech, man  Whatever happened  Like, my dad  Came to this country  So he could make  A little more money  And he could say  You suck  Do you know what I'm saying  All of a sudden  You go to work  And you can't say anything, man  You do a chick joke  You're a woman basher  You do a gay joke  Yeah  You know  And of all the people  Of all the people  To complain about jokes  Fags are the worst  I mean, completely 
[01:49:30]  Because if you can take a  You can take a joke  That's, you know  That's not even a joke  That's just my motto, man  Seriously  That's not like  You know  Like, how could you say  You hurt me  You, I hurt, dude  Last night  You had a  A big one  In your front  I hurt you  Dude, how old  I either  Dude, man  You gotta look at life  A little different, man  And, you know  It's just like people 
[01:50:00]  You can't  You can't go there, you know  Hey  And any time  There's a conflict  Between people  Of different races  Like, a white guy  Punches a black guy  In the face  Is a hate crime  Maybe the guy  Was just an a-hole  You know  Maybe they just got  Into a fight  And he punched  The guy in the face  But everyone's  Gotta label everything  Hate crimes  And what not  But the truth of the matter is  Maybe he was just an a-hole  But why can't you just  Call somebody an a-hole  You can't  You know what I mean  Why can't you  You're an a-hole  You can 
[01:50:30]  If you're black  And you call a black guy  That, it's fine  If you're white  You call a white guy  That, it's fine  But once you mix it up  Oh, now you're  A racist  It's horrible  But you know what  White people  It's your fault  Alright  I want you to know that  No, because you made it  All politically correct  To the point where  Like, you know what I mean  Nobody can  Nobody can say anything anymore  I used to go on stage  A long time ago  And tell white people  And tell Hispanics  And blacks too  Listen man  Stop telling white people  Not to do these jokes  Alright  Because I knew  What was going to happen 
[01:51:00]  And I swear to God  It happened  Last month  I went on a radio show  And they told me  You can't do jokes  Oh no, no  That's not what it was  I'll say it  The Tonight Show  They called me  And they said  I'm the only guy  To get a standing ovation  In The Tonight Show  Since Jay Leno took over  But this was like  A year and a half  Or two years ago  And they never had me on  You see  So they called me  The other day  And they said  We'd love to have you  On the show  But you can't do  Any ethnic jokes  Only jokes that are ethnic  Like against you  You can do any kind of  Spanish  You know 
[01:51:30]  Jokes that you want  But you can't say black  You can't do anything at all  That's sad  And I swear  I knew that day  Was going to happen  You know what I mean  And now that day's come  Where like  Even I can't do jokes  About other people now  Because people are sensitive  You know what I mean  And you hear my feelings  So they told you  Not to do it  And you  No, I said I can't do it  And you said  I said then I won't do it  Because then  It doesn't represent  What I do  You know what I mean  Because I pick on everybody  I don't care if you're white  Or you're black  You know  To me it doesn't matter  Because the way I look at it

[01:56:30]  And we were doing this  Economics class  And we were studying  About social security  Right  My mom was born in Mexico  My dad was born in Honduras  So they had a lot of kids  Because you know  Where they come from  There's no social security  So they have a lot of kids  Hoping we make money  Eventually taking care of them  In the end  That's pretty much  Everybody from an old country  That's their state of mind  So I go up to my dad  I say we're discussing this dad  And blah blah blah  And I need to do a report on it  So you're kind of the guy 
[01:57:00]  That we need to ask  Because you have so many kids  And you know  This was the theory  Behind what we thought  Blah blah blah  So I need to ask you  Why so many though  Why 18  Was it because of  What was the reason  And my dad goes  Oh it's not that complicated  Your mother just doesn't like to suck  Wait a minute  I swear to God dude  And my jaw drops to the floor dude  I swear to God  So then I go  So then I look at him 
[01:57:30]  Seriously I go  Dad  You know  Thanks for  Thanks for like sharing a moment  Of like  You know I'm trying to be like serious  I want to get an A in the report  Yeah thanks for helping out  You know  I'm not going to put that in the report  And then my dad goes  No now you got to put it in  If you ask me  You got to put it in  I'm going to read it  And if it's not in there  I'm going to rip it up  You got to put it in  If you ask me  You got to put it in there  I'm like  What why do you want me  To put it in there for  You're sick man  He's sick  And then he's like  Because I want people to know  Then they may be  Tell her and she changes  Like all of a sudden 
[01:58:00]  People at school  Are going to be saying  You know  Mrs. Mencia doesn't  For her  Like that's going to happen  Dad  And then she's going to  Hear it someday  And eventually  She's going to change  Dude  Why don't you just ask her bro  You know  God man  Dude I have the funniest  My family is so cool  I mean in that  We're just so funny  Everything was always funny 
[01:58:30]  There was never  You know  A moment where  Like when I was  Four years old  I got caught in gunfire  Outside my house  And  It's really funny right  Stereotype bell  Going off like  Hey bro  It's true man  I got caught  I'm like four years old  I got caught  Outside  And I couldn't move  But I could hear the bullets  You can hear bullets  By the way  Whiz in the air  Yeah  They make like a little  And really they do  So I'm there  So I'm there  And I'm facing  The opposite direction  Of my house  I'm about 30 feet 
[01:59:00]  From my house  I slowly roll over  And look at my mom  And she's like  Out in the door  But she doesn't come out  Because the bullets  Are flying  And then anyway  The moment comes to pass  And blah blah blah  And then one day  Like later on  You know  I was like  Mom  I remember that day  That I was out there  I'm cool with it  But you know  Why don't you come out  And like  Save me man  And my mom goes  Hey  You're one of 18  You're not special  Oh god  And then she goes  And Manuel 
[01:59:30]  Looks a lot like you  And I look over  To my dad  Like a puppy  With like a tear  In his eye  And he goes  Well why'd you ask  You know what  She's gonna say  Oh that's awful  Dude it's so  Like you know  My family  Is just  Everything was always  You know  Make it funny man  Make it funny  And the stereotypes  That's to me  Like where a lot  Of this stuff  Comes from  You know what I mean 
[02:00:00]  Where the basis  Of it is stereotypes  Like here's a stereotype  White people  Hate to truly complain  Except in New York  When you know  You're Jewish  But like this  Normal everyday  Average white Americans  Hate to complain  Yeah  Right  And it's like  I don't know  Where it came from  But it did  And that's why  This whole election  Got screwed up  Because those  Old white people  You know what I mean  Didn't want to complain  Even though they knew  When they left  Because I was there  In Miami 
[02:00:30]  And I heard an interview  On the radio  Where they asked  An older Jewish guy  Who did you vote for  And he actually said  I don't know  It was confusing  I hope I voted for Gore  God damn  I swear to God  Right  But they didn't complain  That day  And see I don't understand  That  Because in my culture  You complain  Black people  Man if there was a ballot  In the black part of  Dade County  That they didn't understand  There would be a black guy  Still right now  Going  Hell no  You can't close this 
[02:01:00]  Man  Explain this to a nigga  One more time  In a barnish  This is a  He's hiding  That's a  West side  Let the ballot  Know what's up man  You know  But the white people  It's like  We're going to send a fax  And email  Our dissatisfaction  To get some of the service  You know  And like  These old people  You know  We couldn't understand  The ballot  Yeah  But when you go  Play bingo  Your ass has 20 cards  And you keep track  Of every single one  Oh and it's bingo time  He can see us 
[02:01:30]  Through his ass  You know what I mean  All of a sudden  It's voting time  Two times  Retard  So anyway  That foundation  Right  Of that  Comes from this  I'm with my friends  At this place  Called Jack in the Box  Which I don't think  You guys have out here  You used to have  Jack in the Box  Do we still have  One or two left  Alright so  Jack in the Box  We ran through  Jack in the Box  And four of us  We order  Whatever  Burgers and the fries  We're about  Two minutes away  From the drive-thru  I go 
[02:02:00]  Hey where's my fries  And my wife  Oh dude  They forgot  Don't worry about it  Just have some of our fries  I'm like  Dude no  I want my fries  I want your fries  I paid for fries  I want my fries  Let's go back  And get my fries  Oh dude  We're not gonna go back  Dude  Whatever  You can have some of our fries  And I'm like  Listen  A-hole  I want my fries  I want your fries  See I paid for my fries  So then my wife  Alright you know what  They forgot my fries  No we already established  They were my fries  They forgot  So you can't go back 
[02:02:30]  And pretend they're yours  See I want my fries  And so anyway  Like anyway  I got pissed  They didn't go back  And I realized that  For me  It was the opposite extreme  When I was a kid  We used to go to  Kentucky Fried Chicken  Once a month  Or two months  Whatever  It was like our big  Family outing  And we would drive  Twenty minutes  To go get food  For twenty people  Right  Now nobody liked  Macaroni and cheese  Except for my dad  So he would order  The little small thing  The macaroni and cheese  I remember one time  Drove there  Got our food 
[02:03:00]  Went back  Put everything on the table  Pati and my dad  Go hold up  Where's the macaroni and cheese  And my mom goes  Ay mijo  I think they forgot it  Put everything back  In the back  Right now  We wanna go back  For the macaroni and cheese  I swear to God  Dude  He made us put  The whole  Two buckets  Of twenty  The whole thing  For twenty people  For a little  Macaroni and cheese  Dude  And we're in the car  Looking at each other  Like dude  Our dad is a  Stone cold 
[02:03:30]  Wet back immigrant  This is not even  Cool man  We speak English  Bro  I gotta go to school  With some of the people  That work at this place  Unbelievable  And my dad goes in  Like throws the thing  And goes  Where's the macaroni and cheese  That's the first words  Out of his mouth  And people looking at him  Funny  He's like  You got a camera  Go look at the camera  I paid for the macaroni and cheese  I drove twenty minutes  And now  You gotta give me more chicken  You gotta give me more chicken  Cause you forgot  Get more chicken  Dude  And we're in the back  Going oh man  Our dad is 
[02:04:00]  Oh my god  And you know  He fulfilled that stereotype  Man I don't have a problem  With that  That's who he was man  And part  Of that  Is me too  I just don't go  That far  With it  You know what I mean  That's funny  There's someone  Anthony what's up  Hey  If you want to play stereotypes  The reason why us white folks  Don't complain  Cause we're too busy working  That's funny  But actually  You know what  You guys don't  Stereotype like  You guys don't work as hard  As like immigrants 
[02:04:30]  Cause immigrants  I mean  Believe it or not  You can say white people work hard  But  Wherever you go in America  It doesn't matter now  It really  Like there used to be a day  And people who travel  Will tell you  There used to be a day  When you traveled  You would probably  Like kind of know  Where you were going  You know  If you were going to Miami  New York or LA  It would be ethnic  You know Chicago  But if you were going  Like Birmingham  Alabama  It's pretty much white people  Today  You can catch a flight  To Birmingham  Alabama  And it looks like  You're going to New York  You know what I mean  There's no like  That thing is gone 
[02:05:00]  Man  There's ethnicities  Are just everywhere  And you don't realize it  Until like  You know  Birmingham  Is probably the  Whitest city in the world  The most denoted  Racist city in the world  But at 9 o'clock  In the morning  Bro  At my hotel  Bueno  Es husky  She was there dude  I don't know  How she got there bro  I was talking to her  And she couldn't even  Say Birmingham  I was like  You can't even say Birmingham  She was just like  I can  I said  It was the funniest thing man  You know what I mean 
[02:05:30]  So  They work really hard  But see  I like the fact that the guy  Had the balls to call in  And do that  That's cool man  It's funny  We encourage that  We encourage that on our show  Dude  I love when people  Acknowledge that  It's cool enough  To tell jokes about each other  Yeah  We like to think that  Yeah  Unfortunately  Some people can't take a joke  Yeah but here's the thing  Not that it affects us  We don't care  But here's the thing  Here's like  This is the way I break it down  Very simplistically  If somebody were to drop a bomb  Let's just name a country 
[02:06:00]  Let's just name Russia  Or China  Let's say China  If China tomorrow  Were to drop a bomb in Denver  Alright  Is there anybody  Is there anybody  In the city of New York  Whatever ethnicity you are  That will not be willing  To go to war  Against China  No  So you're willing  To die for each other  Basically  You're willing  Everybody out there  That's willing  To fight for America  Is willing to preserve  My right  Carlos Muncie is right  As an American  To do and say  Whatever is constitutionally upheld  So  If you're willing  To die for me  Don't you think  It would be nice  If I let you tell a joke  About my ass 
[02:06:30]  Do you know what I'm saying  I mean it's just like  That simple  I'm willing to die for you  Tell a joke  It's that simple for me  So if everybody  Gets a hair up their ass  I really don't care  Because when push comes to shove  I'm there for you dude  We're family  And so  The reason why I do stereotypes  Is because they're not a big deal  Now if Mexico  Goes to war  Oh dude  I'll kill Mexicans  In a heartbeat bro  Because I ain't  I ain't a real Mexican bro  I mean I'm only like  You can call me a Mexican  If you want 
[02:07:00]  Just because  So you know  That I like  A Mexican  A Mexican American  I'm not even a Mexican American  I wish I was half  And then I only pay half my taxes  But that doesn't work out that way  I'm a Mexican American  And then on April 15th  You're all American  You know what I mean  I'm going to do that  They don't give you that half rebate  For the other half  You know which  I've totally been asking for  But they don't hook me up with that  No I mean  You know  I don't like that term  African American  You know  Anybody who thinks  They're African American  I mean unless you came from Africa  And even if you did  You left there  Because it sucks  So right there  You're not African anymore  But like people that grew up here 
[02:07:30]  Like I'm African American  No you're not dude  And I'm not Mexican  And I speak Spanish  Fluently  And I'm telling you  I'm not a real Mexican  I will buy any black person  That grew up here  Alright  African American  A ticket  A ticket  To Rwanda  When you get off the plane  And they look at your black ass  And go  What are you going to get a flashback  What are you going to remember  That ain't going to happen bro  You're going to be like  He's sorry  That's what you're going to be like  You know what I'm saying  The Bronx is in the house 
[02:08:00]  That's what you're going to say  I mean  Let's just be honest  You know what I mean  Nobody wants to like admit  Like everybody wants to hate America now  Everybody  You know what I mean  Nobody wants to love it  Black people want to hate it  The Bronx want to hate it  White people want to  Like they changed it too much  They changed it too much  You know  Like if you look at the voting patterns  Of America  It's like everybody who voted for Gore  The little blue specks  Were like all surrounding  The coastline  Right  Yeah  Because everybody  All the white people  Are like moving to the middle  You know what I mean 
[02:08:30]  And they think that  That's a smart thing to do  But then every year  They come out  And get hit by tornadoes  And they go  We need help  We got hit  The tarniter again  And these are the people  That say  You know  Black people don't even know  How to spoke did rats  You know  If I'm not mistaken  There is no R  At the end of tornado  Bubba  You know what I'm saying  What did that happen  You see  Like that stuff  Everybody  Everybody screws up English  You know what I mean 
[02:09:00]  Like people that pick on black people  For ebonics  Everybody does it  Hispanics do it  You know what I mean  We make up words  That aren't English  Or Spanish  You know what I mean  Like we'll take the word push  And take the word empujar  Right  And make  Puchar  You know  And only if you live here  Do you understand  What that means  But you think  That's why we get bad grades  In Spanish  Because we think  I'm no Spanish  And then we take it in high school  A D  How did I get a D  You know what I mean  And then your parents  Are like  How come you get a D 
[02:09:30]  Because you told me  Puchar was a word  It's your fault  Not my fault  You know what I mean  You're pissed  You know  And all of a sudden  They're the ones  That taught you the heritage  And they taught it  To you screwed up  And you're the retard  You know what I mean  Everybody screws up  Asians have  Have the highest  The highest GPA in America  But you go to one of their  You know their liquor stores  And you still have to buy  A lottery ticket  Dude what did  What did you get in English  Oh in English  A press  A press  Can I get a lottery ticket

[02:20:00]  And he'll sing you a soft lullaby  Tonight  Why can't it all be like it was before?  How can I explain  Why mommy's not here  Anymore  Cause daddy likes porno and ten dollar hoards 
[02:20:30]  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores  Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus  I think that's why your mommy left us  Pretty  Hush little girl  There is no reason to fret 
[02:21:00]  Tonight  Don't mind the smoke  Daddy just wants to forget  The microphone  Soon  Soon  It will all  Be like it was  Before  Any minute  She will walk through  That front door

[02:22:30]  Light  Lady Day.  Look at me.  Oh, Megan.  Look at me.  I'm all teared up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Hey, even Dice is tearing up over there.  Yeah, you got me. 
[02:23:00]  You got my sensitive side.  Yeah.  Jack is.  Who cares?  We can't play chocolate salty balls anymore.  We got some new songs.  That's Stephen Lynch.  His CD's called Half a Man.  You can order it by emailing him at pusshead at aol.com.  That marketing's really taking off, isn't it?  That's not my forte.  And it's pusshead, P-U-S, not pusshead, which is P-U-S-S, obviously.  What did everybody do before the Internet? 
[02:23:30]  Like, you know, send me a postcard or something.  P-O-5.  You know?  Is that what you did?  I don't know.  All right.  It's not as funny as a sinking school bus.  I have a strong stomach.  You guys made me poach.  I'm great.  The grossest thing I've ever heard in my life.  O-N-A, my two new favorite whores.  You guys are really horrible.  Opie and Anthony.  What a couple of ass wipes.  1027.  WNEW.  Uh-oh.  I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial. 
[02:24:00]  Anthony?  Yes.  Mujan.  Mujan.  You want to explain to George the Puppet what Mujan is?  Mujan is a wonderful way for women to get rid of unwanted body hair.  Bikini line, legs, even mustaches, facial hair that girls might have.  And it's so much better than shaving.  Nipple hair, whatever.  It leaves the body very smooth.  Mujan.  Is that like electrolysis? 
[02:24:30]  No.  It's a strip that comes in a package of the Mujan 2000.  You press it on and peel it off.  And completely smooth.  Wonderful, smooth, sexy skin.  The name is smooth.  It's basically yanking pubic hairs out.  I remove it.  Mujan.  It should be cold.  Ah!  Oh!  You know, we just spoke at the people from Mujan.  Yeah.  We had a demonstration in our office.  It is quick, painful, and completely removes hair. 
[02:25:00]  Do you have a hairy knish?  Try Mujan.  Here's you.  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this.  Yanking my t*** hairs out by the roof, so I look good in a sundress.  Ah!  It should be cold.  Ah!  Oh, sorry.  Yankee?  Wait, wait.  That line has to be on the radio. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, it's great.  Thank you.  It's easy.  Peel, press it off.  Press it on and pull it off.  Unwanted hair.  Gone.  Almost painless.  No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate the skin.  Mujan.  Gentle.  Has botanicals.  Hypoallergenic.  Removes hair completely.  It's slow to grow back.  Lighter, thinner.  Skin is softer, sexier than before.  Mujan.  It's wonderful.  You always throw that aloe in there.  There's aloe in there? 
[02:26:00]  What is that?  I'm bleeding.  I'm going to go to a hospital.  There's aloe in there.  There will be no blood from Mujan.  It's wonderful.  It's so gentle.  We saw a demonstration.  The hair comes off.  You don't even feel it.  I know it's fine.  It's the most desirable way to remove hair.  You know what else is good?  Closing a storm window on your testicle is also good.  It's not, you know, for the hot weather.  All right.  Just drop a storm window on your teabag. 
[02:26:30]  There's aloe in that window.  You want some aloe in your testicle?  Mujan.  The most comfortable way to remove hair at home.  Why pay those salon prices?  Mujan removes hair completely.  It's available at Dwayne Reed, Harmon Cosmetics, Genevieve's Drugs, and Cosmetics Plus.  If you don't see Mujan, go to the store manager and say,  Hey, my girl's got a poodle in her lap. 
[02:27:00]  I need Mujan.  And I got actual audio of a girl?  Yes.  After she, you know, waxed her hair.  Okay.  Let's hear it.  It's so smooth.  She's so sexy.  She doesn't even need a brain anymore.  It's amazing.  So to get hair off of that...  Cousin! 
[02:27:30]  No one even heard this spot, but it's hilarious.  I don't even give a crap.  Ten people on hold are enjoying this.  Yeah, they hear the unadded version.  Oh, yeah.  Not anymore, Otto.  There's aloe in there.  Thanks for asking ahead of time.  You get hit by a truck that's carrying aloe.  Does it still hurt?  Ponder that one for a while.  Mujan. 
[02:28:00]  The best way to remove that unwanted body hair.  All right.  Ask for it at a cosmetics store near you.  Hour, hour, hour, hour, hour.  By O.P. and Anthony.  Perfect, New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  Uh, Regis. 
[02:28:30]  Yes.  Regis has a new co-host.  A new co-host for Live with Regis and who?  Uh, it's now going to be called Live with Regis and Kelly.  Regis and Kelly.  Kelly's from...  Well, who's this hot whore?  Kelly's from All My Children.  I love it.  Some hot number on my show, finally.  I dumped that, uh, Kathy Lee.  And now this one.  Ooh, I want to get my F on with her.  Let me tell you. 
[02:29:00]  Uh...  I'll slam that A.  Uh, C.  Uh, Regis.  Everything.  Gelman, get me a rubber.  Uh, I don't know where she's been.  Uh, uh, Regis.  Who wants to F Regis?  Uh, uh, Regis.  I'll punch her in the teeth.  Regis, before you think that...  Yes.  Please.  Uh-huh.  She's from, uh, All My Children.  All My Children.  You know, those, uh, soap girls.  Very hot.  I like that.  I'll get my F on.  Uh, uh...  I've cheated on my wife one time, according to the star, allegedly.  I gotta say that, you know.  He has sold the wine.  All right, Mike Tyson. 
[02:29:30]  Uh, Regis.  Yes.  She's four months pregnant.  Four months pregnant?  What?  Your new co-host is four months pregnant.  It's gonna be Regis...  Four months...  If this bitch calls it Cody or Cassidy, I'm killing her.  Killing her!  I gotta get Mike Tyson on the phone.  Perhaps he could punch her in the gut a few times.  Gelman, come here.  Gelman!  First show with, live with, uh, Regis and Kelly.  It's an abortion show.  Hangar abortion show.  Four months?  That's not bad.  Gelman, get over here. 
[02:30:00]  Regis.  Help me out with this thing.  Get me some gloves and a hanger.  Regis, you're outrageous.  I'm gonna pull the fetus out, Gelman.  You're outrageous.  Do you, uh, do you honestly believe I want another woman here that's having a baby?  I, I was tired of the stories all day with the, the, the, the Cassidy and the Cody.  Now I'm gonna have a Kelly, uh, talking about children?  Get the hanger, Gelman.  Get me a Flobie.  We'll suck it out.  Jesus.  I don't care. 
[02:30:30]  You know, we sit on those, uh, high stools on the set.  Perhaps she could just fall and a spontaneous miscarriage.  Help me, Gelman.  Grease the stool.  Do something.  What do you do, Gelman?  It's not that bad.  I thought, I, uh.  She's young.  She could bounce back.  I, I thought you wanted to, to do her, though, Regis.  Uh, fine.  But she doesn't have to get pregnant.  What's the matter?  You don't do it in the dumper?  Do it in the dumper, Kelly.  Just suck it, you bitch.  Unbelievable.  Now she'll be babbling about children. 
[02:31:00]  I finally got rid of that, that twat, Kathy Lee.  Now I have to deal with this.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  That's what Regis and the president say.  Eatin' ain't cheatin'.  Well, congratulations, Regis.  Well, I did know about this pregnancy thing.  It's Regis and Kelly.  For God's sake.  Starting next Monday.  Regis and Kelly Lee?  No, no, no, no.  Kelly Ripa or something like that.  Perhaps I could spike her food with some kind of a spontaneous abortion pill. 
[02:31:30]  Well, think of the ratings, Kelly.  Think of the ratings.  Well, she's propped up in the stirrups.  Me, with gloves and a hanger on.  Maybe we could have a guest help me.  We'll have Wayne Newton come on and assist.  He's always good on the show.  And the fetus will look just like GIF.  Dig in here.  Let me dig in.  Hold on, Gellman.  Okay, I got an arm.  I'm gonna puke. 
[02:32:00]  Cut it out.  Look at the ratings go up.  Cut it out.  This bitch better take it in the dumper.  Let's, uh...  Perhaps if she drives home in the snow, she'll hit an abutment.  No, who uses that word?  No, Regis.  You picked her.  You wanted her.  Look, the fetus looks more like Gellman.  You had all those women.  You wanted Kelly.  I didn't know about the pregnancy.  I thought she had a bunt.  I find out it's a baby.  I thought she had a fat upper, you know, Regis. 
[02:32:30]  Not a baby.  I spent years with that Kathy Lee bitch talking about her children.  What, and now I have to look forward to Kelly doing Christmas albums with another little kid?  Hell no.  Hell no.  Get the phobia.  This isn't right.  For the love of God, here it comes.  Give me that baby.  Give me the baby.  Give it to me.  There it goes.  In the toilet.  I swear, Gellman, if she brings that little bastard in, I'm going to kill myself. 
[02:33:00]  I'll kill myself.  There will be ratings.  Or I'll kill it myself.  Right clear the next time, Rick.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Yeah, what's up?  What's the matter with you guys?  What?  What's your problem?  What do you mean, what's my problem?  Regis.  Come on, stop talking about ripping the kids' arm off.  What's the matter with you guys?  Okay, I'll try to get it all in one piece. 
[02:33:30]  Seems to be the problem.  I can understand his outrage.  I'll go in and get the whole thing.  Sam, what's up?  Regis, why are you hitting on Kelly so bad?  Girls are hot.  I don't like the idea of a child, but I'll tell you one thing I'm going to do, Gellman.  I'll leave some prints in that kid's soft head.  Oh, my God.  I'll do it.  Good night, everyone.  You know about doing pregnant women, right?  Of course, Gellman.  Check.  I'm a madman now.  Check.  Madman.  Check, please.  I had it going. 
[02:34:00]  I was having fun with Kelly, and something bit my junk.  I didn't even think they had teeth.  I'll bend her over that tall stool, Gellman.  I'll bend her right over the tall stool.  And speaking of stools.  What?  God damn it, I thought we were all having fun.  Why is everyone so upset on the phone?  I won't have her bringing children in. 
[02:34:30]  Doug, what's going on?  Enough, guys.  Come on.  What's the problem, Doug?  Enough.  Be, be, son.  Doug, talk to me.  What's the problem?  Use your brains.  Use your brains.  Come on.  I'm turning you guys off, but I'll listen to you guys tomorrow.  Doug, what's the problem?  Enough.  Enough with what?  Think about what you're doing.  I'm talking about Kelly, my new co-host.  She's pregnant, Doug.  What am I supposed to do?  She's pretty hot, though.  What am I supposed to do?  Now she's going to bring children on like that Kathy Lee whore. 
[02:35:00]  Enough.  Pull the plug.  Punch out, man.  Pull the plug on the baby.  Oh, Jesus.  I said, Gelman, you bite this umbilical cord.  You bite it.  What's your problem with kids?  Rick, what?  It's always time to stop when Rick writes that one.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Why doesn't O.J. just take care of the whole thing?  That's what I'm worried about here.  I mean, the whole Regis thing.  O.J., O.J., hello?  Regis Philbin, O.J.  From live with Regis and some other whore.  Kelly.  Regis and Kelly.  Kelly, whatever.  Big day for you, Regis. 
[02:35:30]  O.J., I need your help.  Come on the show.  And I swear to God, could you just slit someone's throat again?  You've done it once before.  What's the problem?  She's blonde and white.  Kill her.  Kill the bitch.  If she only liked it up the old dirt road.  She wouldn't be pregnant.  I wouldn't have to worry about these things.  I love it.  You know something?  If only she was a crumpet muncher.  If she was a crumpet muncher, there wouldn't be this problem. 
[02:36:00]  Well, doggie.  The baby from her stomach is checking in.  Yes, little one.  Yeah, why don't you come try it, you little bitch?  Come on, I swear to God, I'm going to stick my hand in the elbow deep and pull you out.  I can't take these kids anymore.  Yeah, he tried it with a wire, son of a bitch.  I'll get you next time.  You're bobbing and weaving, but I'll get you.  I'll hook you like a trout.  Smart-ass fetuses, I guess.  I'm trying to do a program. 
[02:36:30]  I'm trying.  Regis, it's your problem, though.  You picked her.  I didn't know.  I swear to God.  You had a lot of other pieces of asses.  I thought she was hitting the Danish a little too hard and had the fat up a P, Regis.  I've seen it before.  And then before you know it, they're parading them on the show singing Christmas songs.  Jay, what's up?  Ed, you are a sick cat.  This brings you to a new low, man.  Why don't you have Mike Tyson come in there and take care of her?  Perhaps I should call Mike Tyson. 
[02:37:00]  A couple of body blows the baby's got.  Maybe we could get her familiar with the surroundings of the set.  Bring her up on the catwalk for the lighting and push her off.  Gelman, book it.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, Regis, can we poll the audience and see if we can ask them if we can tickle a placenta?  Maybe put it in a jar?  Now, you're that confident that the audience can help you?  Well, how cocky he gets.  You're that confident you're going to phone a friend. 
[02:37:30]  How about you phone the fetus and tell him get the hell out of it?  Let's go to Carol.  Carol, what's up?  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Hello?  Hey.  Regis, I have bad news for you.  What now?  Miss Ripa already has a child.  You're kidding.  No, I watch all my children and this is her second child, yeah.  It doesn't sing, does it?  I don't believe so.  Perhaps I could beat the child with the fetus.  Take two birds with one stout, Gelman.  What a c**t.  Oh, whoa, Regis.  What's the problem? 
[02:38:00]  Hello?  You can't say that.  I say it on my show all the time, the sea work.  You can't say that.  See you next Tuesday.  You can't say that, John.  But what if she is, John?  Yeah.  What's up?  I want to know if Regis can bang Kelly so hard that he gets a hummer from the fetus.  Oh, my God.  All right, look at the time.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, and I'm sick.  All right, let's change the subject.  Thank you, Regis.  Good luck with the new show, Regis and Kelly. 
[02:38:30]  Thank you, thank you.  A week from Monday.  It's going to be Regis and a pile of placenta.  Live with Regis and a pile of placenta.  I love it.  All right.  Uh, 2-1-2.  Bitch.  7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Right, Matt Dumper.  We'll, uh, we'll take a break and, uh, hopefully we'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're going to talk to the guy that was injured at a fast food restaurant.  Very similar story, like the one that appears in the papers today. 
[02:39:00]  Uh, hello.  Hello.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  Oh, God.  I was very injured.  Where were you injured?  At a fancy coffee shop.  Okay.  Oh, I was drinking coffee.  You know how it makes you have to pinch a loaf.  Sure.  When you drink too much.  Yeah.  I went to the bathroom.  Okay.  And I was very nervous.  Uh-huh.  And I had a loose stool.  Wow.  Very messy.  Yeah.  And I couldn't find the toilet paper. 
[02:39:30]  Okay.  Like the gentleman, uh, you read about.  Yeah, in the paper today.  All right.  And I went to reach back and, like him, the toilet seat shifted.  Okay.  And snapped down on my penis like a bear trap.  Now it's all flattened like a fruit roll-up.  I was screaming in pain.  Uh-huh.  And one of the workers came in and started laughing at me.  Why was he...  And my ass was still soiled.  And I'm suing.  It was... 
[02:40:00]  I was degraded.  You were very degraded, huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  And now I can't have coital relationships with my wife no more.  Well, were you having sex before the, uh, the mishap?  Well, no.  Oh, I see.  But now it's very embarrassing.  I see.  Because we tried.  Yeah.  And, uh, she was laughing at me because when I got excited, it looked like one of those  party favors.  It unrolled.  You ever see the kids' parties?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  My schlong was passed apart. 
[02:40:30]  And I lost my glasses.  You...  What is...  And my shoes.  You lost your glasses and shoes when you were in there.  And I spilled a hot coffee latte on my testicles.  Oh.  I got off the boat screaming, help me.  Yeah.  And I slipped in my own feces and fell on a toilet plunger.  And it impaled me in my back door.  Oh.  We didn't need to hear that.  All the while, they were laughing at me.  Uh-huh. 
[02:41:00]  They just said they'd get me a new coffee latte.  Right.  But I couldn't drink in the establishment with a plunger lodged in my rear end.  No, I don't think that would work.  My penis was damaged, damaged.  I know.  That's what you said.  I hear you're suing for like $2 million.  $2 million.  Yeah.  I can only make love to a coin slot now.  Slat and damaged.  Horrible.  I went to the hospital.  They laughed at me.  Yeah.  They wanted to hook it up to some kind of air pump.  It's a gas pump. 
[02:41:30]  Pump some new life.  I got a fancy inflate.  Sure.  It's like a basketball pump.  Right.  And I said, oh, so you're hurting me.  And they all laughed at my broiled testicles.  No, I must say you're a mess.  I'm suing.  Okay.  Oh.  For $2 million over an injured pee-pee.  Oh.  Hey, could I speak to Anthony?  Um.  Pull that one off, smart ass.  Oh, look.  Well, Anthony's smoking a cigarette, sir. 
[02:42:00]  Stop it.  His mother doesn't want to hear that.  He'll be very angry.  Oh, boy.  If he learns he's even smoking.  Are you related to Anthony?  No, but I know his mother.  She'll be pissed.  She'll be pissed if she knows that you're smoking a past day?  Shut up.  He's not smoking anymore.  He was smoking for a couple of weeks during a trying period in his life.  I see.  Shut the ass up.  I also have heard that Anthony may be freebasing at this point.  Don't even start those rumors. 
[02:42:30]  All right.  I'll give in to the cigarette smoke.  This is getting too real.  Shut up.  So there's no truth to the freebasing rumors?  None.  Okay.  I don't know where that came from.  All right.  Tell me your stupid brother.  All right.  Your mom wanted to know.  That's all.  I figured we'd bring it up on the air today.  Who's mom?  Mine?  Anthony's mom.  Oh, Anthony.  Yeah.  Put him on the phone.  Well, he's still busy smoking that cigarette. 
[02:43:00]  Remember?  He's not smoking.  Shut up.  Oh, he's going to sue you.  Anthony will, my pal?  He doesn't smoke.  Okay.  It was for a couple of weeks.  Okay.  But he quit again.  Well, whose cigarettes are these in the studio then?  Shut up.  He's not smoking.  There are no cigarettes in there.  If his mother hears, he's very angry.  Okay.  Oh, he's screwed.  You really should, you know, if you are, if Anthony's going to be smoking again, he really 
[02:43:30]  should buy the ones with filters.  They are.  They were.  They were filtered cigarettes.  I'm going to kick your ass.  All right.  Well, thank you for calling in with this exclusive story.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Thank you.  I'm suing.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  We got our buddy Nick from Penthouse on the hotline. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Because we were thumbing through the latest issue of Penthouse, the April issue of Penthouse,  and I came up with a little observation.  Yeah.  We need a little clarification.  How do we say this without saying too much?  Call it the money shot or the byproduct of a romantic physical contact. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  Well, there you go.  Very good, Anthony.  First of all, first observation, there's too much junk in Penthouse.  Well, there's a whole spread that you're looking at there of a girl giving a Hummer.  Giving a Hummer.  Okay.  And then this is the shot I have a problem with.  The money shot.  The money shot.  You know, the last page of the Hummer pictorial.  Let me read, Anthony. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  And I think we can get this on the air.  Let's give it a whirl.  Just so everyone has that fine visual in their head before we get to Nick.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  Blank in my mouth, Lisa pleads.  Oh.  You could say that, right?  Blank?  They said it all the time on Match Game.  You could say that, right?  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, ho, ho.  How's that for a popper?  Oh, ho.  Get that Match Game.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  All right.  So it says, blank in my mouth.  Right.  I don't know what that means. 
[02:45:30]  Blank.  Lisa pleads.  Blanking more passionately on Tony's blank.  Ah.  Mm.  Richard Dawson says, chicken.  Then her finger inches toward his blank blank.  Blank blank.  Wow.  Uh, she, she blanks just the tip.  Oh.  And it is enough to make his blank.  Um, hmm.  What? 
[02:46:00]  His blank erupts all over her blank.  Yeah.  Glazing her blank and blank with his blank blank.  Thank you.  Brett Summers says, Brett, what's your answer?  I say it's gotta be a Buick.  Ha, ha, ha.  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Okay.  Looking up with a smile, Lisa asks, are you up for working late tonight?  Uh, what?  Bringing back Tony answers, whatever you need boss. 
[02:46:30]  Ah, it's the boss, and the guy is the worker.  Right.  All right.  All right, so now everyone has the visual.  Money shot.  Money shot right there.  Mouth agape.  Oh, how's that for a topper?  That's a topper.  And there is a byproduct just streaming down.  But this is the observation Ant and I made.  Well, like, we've been through one of these penthouse shoots, 
[02:47:00]  and you don't do anything without them studying the shot,  making sure the lighting's perfect.  Everything's calculated.  Everything is set up.  They don't leave things to chance when they're taking these pictures.  So how could they possibly leave a money shot to chance  that it's going to look like that when they're done?  The perfect.  That's the perfect money shot.  That is perfect.  See down on her chin?  Right.  How do you make sure that's going to happen?  Right.  That little globule is going to happen. 
[02:47:30]  Because if it was a messy money shot, I think you could say that.  Or maybe sometimes, what if there wasn't enough?  Or it ended up somewhere a little awkward.  Quite frankly, if it was messy,  it would mess up this fine makeup job that the makeup artist had to do.  Right.  For this particular shot.  You're right.  So we were thinking.  The perfect lipstick, the mascara, the pancake makeup.  Oh, well, that could be it too.  So Ed and I have decided that, wow, we're going out on a limb here. 
[02:48:00]  But we're thinking that this is some other substance.  It's not real.  It's not real.  It's got to be some type of formula, some type of concoction.  Right.  That they whip up and apply, and it looks just like the byproduct.  Now, we can make a game out of this.  Nick.  Yeah.  All right.  A couple things.  Mm-hmm.  Listen very carefully, because we might make a game out of this.  Okay.  Don't say what it is, but are we right to assume that that's not actual you-know-what? 
[02:48:30]  Uh, on occasion, that is a correct assumption.  All right.  What about on page 123 of the latest issue of Penthouse?  Of the pictorial in question?  Yes.  That is a correct assumption.  That is not real, right?  Right.  All right.  Nick, can we play a game, guess the substance?  Sure.  All right.  Now, what do we got, Ben?  Do you want Ben-Hur DVDs?  What do we got?  Ben-Hur DVDs.  Damn you!  I can't believe you're giving away my greatest movie ever. 
[02:49:00]  In conjunction with such a disgusting contest.  I remember when I gave a money shot to Nova.  It was wonderful.  All over my loincloth.  Damn it!  I gave a bath to that red manger last, too.  On Zira.  She loved it.  And Cornelia saw it just dripping down her leg.  Unbelievable.  I taught you to gargle.  Damn you, all the hell! 
[02:49:30]  You're giving away my Ben-Hur DVD?  But people have to ask, what is emerging from this junk?  I'm disgusted.  I was most servant of the Lord God.  And you're bringing me into this disgusting contest.  Yes!  Damn you!  A plague upon your city. 
[02:50:00]  A plague of spew on your city.  Try to walk through that.  Screw the flaming hell and frogs.  Splooch!  A storm of splooch.  Will come upon you, Ramses.  Ramses, what a coincidence.  Wait a minute.  It was Ramses.  Okay, now it makes sense.  Go ahead.  Everything's fine.  By the way, that's how you do Charlton Heston. 
[02:50:30]  Nick.  You can hear my walking.  Nick.  Yeah, I'm just sitting here enjoying Anthony.  All right.  So we have either a Ben-Hur DVD for the winner or tickets to see Raw's War at Nassau Coliseum on Monday, May 7th for the WWF coming back to town.  Okay?  All right.  Let's go to the phones and see if we can get a winner.  I hope this doesn't take too long.  Will it take long, you think?  Hey, where's my bell for the correct answer?  God damn it. 
[02:51:00]  Get the bell.  All right.  We'll start with Sal.  Sal?  Yeah.  It's Queen Rinse.  No.  Oh, sorry.  Sorry, Sal.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Can we ask Nick?  Can I ask Nick a question?  Yeah.  All right, Nick.  Yeah.  Is it something common?  Let's just say that.  Very, yes.  All right.  It's something very common.  That's the only clue that we'll give right now.  All right.  Let's go to Reed. 
[02:51:30]  Reed, what's going on?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  Can I ask a question?  Yeah.  One question.  Wait a minute.  One question.  It's got to be yes or no.  If you get a no answer, you're out.  You can't even guess.  You can't even guess.  All right.  Is it a food product?  Yes.  All right.  It's a food product.  Now you get to ask another question or guess.  All right.  I'll take a guess.  All right.  Egg whites.  No.  Thank you.  Wait.  Let me take a look.  Egg whites?  That don't look like egg whites. 
[02:52:00]  You don't want to get salmonella.  All right.  Hold on.  I've got to keep hanging up and then going here.  Okay.  Let's.  Wow.  No one's guessing.  All right.  Let's try Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey.  This is Steve.  How you doing?  All right.  You're talking to me from Penthouse.  I think it's dishwashing liquid.  You jackass.  You're not paying attention.  Thank you, Andy.  You've got to pay attention.  What is he?  Stupid.  It's a food product.  It's a food product. 
[02:52:30]  Some type of food product.  And, Opie, I want you to remember what my guess was in the office.  What was your guess?  I said.  No.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Write it down.  Okay.  I'll write it down because I believe this is it.  Right?  Let me see.  No way is that it.  All right.  Let me write down my answer.  And you are so off.  Okay.  That's what I think it is.  Let me see the picture again.  Let me see the picture.  Okay.  There you go.  I'm going to take a good look.  Let me get Steve to guess while you look at it.  Steve, what's up? 
[02:53:00]  What's up?  Hey.  I think it's the milk mustache stuff.  Milk mustache stuff?  Yeah.  The stuff you use in the milk mustache commercials?  Well, you've got to come up with something.  And what is that?  Ah, it's a good kind of milk.  Would that be milk?  Some kind of milk.  Some milk.  Some kind of milk.  All right.  I'm surprised we don't have an answer yet.  Hmm.  Wait a minute.  Let me go to Dan.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  All right.  I haven't seen it yet, so I want to ask a question.  Okay.  Is it opaque or translucent? 
[02:53:30]  Oh.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  That's kind of an odd question.  It's a little of both.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like product.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to say mayonnaise.  No, no.  Not mayonnaise.  Not mayonnaise.  No.  All right.  Let's see.  This could take a while.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Is it jello pudding?  No.  Nick, is it...  Get on yourself.  What did he say?  Vanilla pudding.  Vanilla pudding.  No, it is not. 
[02:54:00]  Shelby pudding!  All right.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Man, this is taking way too long.  Rich, what's up?  Yeah.  I think that it's at Coco Lopez.  Cream of coconut?  No, but...  You ever see that stuff?  You idiot.  All right.  Let's...  This guy guessed what you guessed, sort of.  Well, not...  Well, kind of.  All right.  Ken, what's going on?  What's up?  Is it vanilla icing, like strudel icing?  That's pretty close, but no. 
[02:54:30]  Oh!  That's pretty close.  Oh!  All right.  All right.  A bell and a buzzer, because that, by the way, was my guess.  Yes.  I thought that's what it was.  All right.  So it's close to icing.  Very close in makeup.  All right.  Let's go to David.  David, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Okay.  It's definitely...  It's a mixture with sugar, and you said it's close to makeup or whipped cream.  Or, why don't you try that cool whip? 
[02:55:00]  Sugar and cool whip.  Yes on the sugar, no on the cool whip.  Oh, so it is a sugar product.  All right.  It's a sugar product.  I'm going to write another guess.  Okay.  Over here, quickly.  All right.  Here we go.  It's not sugar water, right?  Do you want an answer?  No.  Oh.  That's what I'm saying.  Ah.  Okay.  All right.  We'll take a couple more guesses, and then we'll have Nick give the answer.  Jesse, what's up? 
[02:55:30]  It's sugar water.  Sugar and water.  Yeah.  And there's one more element.  There's one more element?  Honey.  There's one more element.  But that's...  Yes.  But there is one more element.  Is it honey?  You know, I'll give it to you.  Who's this?  Jesse?  Yes, Jesse.  I'll give it to Jesse.  It's carot syrup.  Ah.  That was my last thing I wrote down.  Powdered sugar and Cairo syrup.  That's it.  That's it.  Sick, man. 
[02:56:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Do you want to have some DVD?  You want the Ben-Hur DVD?  What did I get?  You get the Ben-Hur DVD.  Wonderful.  Damn you.  Damn you.  Jesse.  Yeah.  You want the Ben-Hur DVD or you want the WWF Raw's war tickets?  Oh, WWF Raw's war tickets.  Damn you, the hell.  What's wrong with my DVD?  It's a homoerotic F-fest, Ben-Hur.  All right.  So, the time of the year it should be different, but it's a little great for me.  The whole chariot sequence is a metaphor for man-on-man anal. 
[02:56:30]  All right, Jesse.  I'm not into that.  You got the WWF Raw's war tickets for the Coliseum, NASA Coliseum, for Monday, May 7th.  Hold on the line, all right?  All right, thanks.  And thanks for playing Guess the Substance.  Nice.  Who knew?  Hey, Nick.  Yo, guys.  So, who applies that stuff to make it look just right?  As you guys remember, when we did our photo shoot, the entire afternoon is a very controlled environment. 
[02:57:00]  Right, see?  And we are very much professionals, and everything is done with everyone being very comfortable.  And usually when we are dealing with women, most of the crew are female.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, you want to keep everybody relaxed, everybody comfortable, and you want to get the  best performance from each person.  But you guys put this stuff on where it looks, look, this looks like the final gasp that's  exiting over here. 
[02:57:30]  Right.  And then what's coming down the chin is amazing.  Yeah.  Amazingly realistic.  There's a perfect drip.  That, I guess, would be what separates us from other publications.  From your swanks.  Very good.  There you go.  Thank you, Nick.  Anytime, gentlemen.  That was fun.  And then guess the substance.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  1027. 
[02:58:00]  WNEW.  Anthony has a great story on your favorite TV host.  Who would that be?  Star Jones.  From The View.  Ah, yes.  I love Star.  She's a diva, you know, Opie.  Whether you think she is or not, she says it.  So I guess it's true.  Diva.  Anyway, the headline reads, cranky view of Star Jones bash.  All right.  This is unbelievable.  Star Jones was nice enough to invite 60 friends to a barbecue at her summer place in the Hamptons, 
[02:58:30]  but not all her guests were so nice.  One ingrate called up MSNBC to complain that guests weren't allowed in the house to use the bathroom, Anthony.  Instead, they were relegated to rented portable toilets on the lawn.  She wouldn't let the guests in her house to use the toilet?  No, she didn't want guests using her bathroom.  Well, I've got a reason for that, honey.  See, my ass is so big, I've got a custom-built toilet bowl. 
[02:59:00]  It's as big as a jacuzzi.  And I was fearful they would fall in with their skinny, narrow asses.  I'm a diva.  Oh, you're a diva, all right.  Also, there were complaints from people that were at this party about the menu that Star Jones selected.  The menu?  What could be wrong with the menu?  Well, Star Jones provided hamburgers and hot dogs for a guest.  Very nice for a barbecue, right?  Uh-huh.  But she reserved the lobster for herself, prepared by her personal chef, which she washed down with some champagne. 
[02:59:30]  Washed down.  You can just picture eating a shell and everything.  Someone goes to the lobster.  What a witch.  Oh, it gets better.  So she sits there. 
[03:00:00]  She sits there.  She's eating lobster and champagne.  Right.  And she's giving her guests.  Well, everyone else has weenies.  And burgers and hot dogs.  Burgers and weenies.  Yeah.  And she gets the champagne.  I don't think she had champagne for everyone, Anthony.  No, probably haven't.  Just mix up some Kool-Aid for them ingrates.  Get the great Kool-Aid.  And then at one point, she told the chef to make sure that no one else got her lobster.  Oh.  That that was for her and not the guests, said a spy.  That's for me. 
[03:00:30]  Diva.  It's star stock.  Get in the portable toilet.  You mud people.  I'm a diva.  I use the bathroom in the house.  Star stock?  Yeah.  Star stock.  Star stock.  I don't know no limp biscuit, but I got budded biscuits and they're all mine.  Keep your hands off them.  I'm hungry.  Why do I sound like Vivian now?  I love the red-eyed chili peppers.  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  Not the band.  I'm just eating red-eyed chili peppers.  Yeah.  It's star stock.  Pass the corn.  Take a hand off if it even got close to her lobster and champagne.  I'm a diva.  And who would want to use that toilet? 
[03:01:30]  Imagine going into Star's bathroom because you know the first image you would get is of  her on that bowl.  With her big old hair.  Big hair.  Yeah.  It's hard for me to line up.  It's like AIM.  I got to use one of them, uh, one of those Norton bomb sites like they use on a bomber plane  just to line up so I don't hit the seat.  There's a lot of ass over here.  I'm a lawyer. 
[03:02:00]  Here we go.  Let me line up.  Yeah, here we go.  Stay out of the bathroom.  Star, I have to use the bathroom.  Use the tree out back.  It's Star's bathroom.  I'm a diva.  There's another one.  Ooh, that was a whole claw from my lobster. 
[03:02:30]  That hurt coming out.  Ooh, that's lobster tail.  Look, it's hanging out.  Look, I look like a lobster.  Look at that.  Star, I really need the bathroom.  Use the pool.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[03:03:00]  Damn, that's a tasty crustacean.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This one's working out pretty good.  Try to...  Ooh.  See?  Stay out in the bathroom. 
[03:03:30]  I'm in here.  Ah, I'm a diva.  This is debauchery mania.  I'm a diva.  Prostate exams for everyone.  I'm a diva.  1-1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva. 
[03:04:00]  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva.  I'm a diva. </pre>
