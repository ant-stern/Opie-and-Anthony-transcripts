<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a live performance of Stephen Lynch’s song "FBA," featuring co-writer Mike DiNicolò, who improvised new lyrics and a spoken-word section. The show then heavily focused on the fallout from a caller, "Eddie," claiming to have committed a double murder in 1977.  Opie and Anthony vehemently denied any involvement in orchestrating this apparent hoax, emphasizing the NYPD’s investigation and Eddie’s subsequent retraction.  News clips from Channel 9 were played, along with discussion of articles criticizing the hosts for allegedly staging the event, and interviews they'd given regarding the incident.

A lengthy and explicit segment followed, involving Opie and Anthony guessing the content of pornographic audio tracks, filled with comedic commentary and innuendo.  Studio guest Mario Cantone then appeared, promoting his Broadway show.  Cantone expressed outrage over a hidden camera recording of Paul Mercurio and a female performer engaging in sexual activity during a previous Broadway performance.  Audio clips of the incident were played repeatedly, fueling Cantone's anger and disgust, and prompting him to scold Opie and Anthony for their behavior.

The conversation with Cantone shifted through various topics: his musical tastes (liking Ja Rule and Nelly, disliking contemporary R&B), a call from Kathleen Turner's sister expressing anger over the earlier incident, the hosts' "Sex for Sam" project, Cantone's *Sex and the City* appearances, a listener criticizing the show's tonal shifts, Cantone’s impressions (including a detailed Shelley Winters impersonation), listener calls, discussions of the O.J. Simpson and Robert Blake murder trials (including a caller's commentary on victims' culpability), the hosts’ "Money Snatch" game (involving naked women grabbing money), a caller attempting a fake orgasm, and mentions of Cher, Mike Tyson, and Sugar Shane Mosley.  Cantone repeatedly promoted his Broadway show.

The show also delved into a discussion sparked by Iamannoying.com, a website listing reasons why Opie and Anthony were (or weren't) annoying.  This led to a discussion of past controversies and their career.  Stephen Lynch later joined, sharing a highly inappropriate and humorous anecdote about his parents, a priest, and a nun defying the Catholic Church to marry.  A significant portion featured an Ann Landers column about a teenage nude slumber party, prompting highly suggestive commentary from the hosts and guests.  Numerous phone calls, including those on the "F.U. Line," were interspersed.  The hosts also repeatedly promoted their upcoming celebrity softball game, discussing sponsors, ticket sales, and the participation of various guests and callers, including Blind Dave.  Throughout the broadcast, crude humor, sexually explicit jokes, and offensive language were prevalent.

A rapid-fire segment featuring listener-submitted "I learned" statements followed, containing crude humor and non-sequiturs, referencing a "sheep lover," musical dildo chairs, Brenda Starr, the XFL, Eddie's double homicide confession, Mario Cantone’s perceived lack of interest in women, and a listener’s fear of grabbing another man's genitals.  A near heart attack caused a brief interruption.  Finally, the hosts promoted a show in Springfield, Virginia, featuring a Neil Diamond tribute act and a Stephen Lynch stand-up performance.  Ben was mentioned as reacting to some of the show's content.  The entire broadcast was punctuated by numerous phone calls from listeners.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I believe Stephen Lynch is coming into the show today, Anthony.  Hanging out.  FBA, we haven't played that in a while.  We should play the live version of that song.  Oh, yeah, that song's got the live version, studio cuts, disco remix.  Can we get the live version?  I don't think we're ready to broadcast.  We'll waste a couple more minutes here.  Wow.  Same song, Stephen Lynch did. 
[00:00:30]  at a road show in front of 3,000 people.  Yeah, it was insane with Mike DiNicola  doing his spoken word part.  They added a bunch of new lyrics,  a spoken word section.  Yes.  As Rick gets that, a couple phone numbers  in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Wow.  Right after the Stephen Lynch thing here,  yes, we're going to wrap up this whole 
[00:01:00]  Eddie the murderer thing.  Please.  Now it's getting ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  A lot of people are convinced that you and I,  Anthony, we're in on it.  Well, that's what I'm hearing.  Go F yourselves.  I got a pile of newspaper articles  about the last couple days of radio.  Yeah.  And I picked out some of the ridiculous articles  that were written about this.  Yeah, some people are hinting that  maybe we were behind this.  Oh, stop it.  Well, we are the masters of hoaxes. 
[00:01:30]  Yes, we are.  You know what?  This one just fell on our laps.  Right.  Laps.  And the news media,  they can't deal with that for some reason.  And we're doing pretty good  as far as our career goes, Opie.  So it's not like we did up in Boston  where we did the mayor gag on purpose  to get fired up there.  Right.  And get the job here in New York.  Correct.  Because we did plan that.  Oh, yeah.  As has been reported in so many publications 
[00:02:00]  over the years.  Of course we did.  If people are going to give us credit  for being that smart,  God damn it,  I'm taking credit for it now.  People have been calling all day.  They're still writing articles.  Uh-huh.  They're trying to get us to crack.  I know.  Like we were trying to get Eddie to crack  the last two days.  And he finally cracked on us.  They keep pounding,  like the waves pounding against the beach, Opie.  They're trying to erode away.  Erode away.  It's not going to work.  Because, you know something?  We didn't plan this one. 
[00:02:30]  Right.  And if Dean Johnson has the balls,  he would call our radio show right now.  Right.  Because I'm going to call him out today.  I know.  I was misquoted.  I'm sick of being misquoted in the papers.  You know,  we had bashed him so many times,  Dean.  Didn't we?  Yeah.  And this one time,  we do it every time.  We bend over the chair,  we spread him,  and when we get the big C and the A,  we wonder,  what happened? 
[00:03:00]  What happened?  What happened this time?  We know he screws us every time.  All right.  Here's Stephen Lynch in front of,  actually,  I think it was about 2,000 people  singing that same song  that started the show today.  And then we'll get into this whole  Eddie the Murderer thing.  I don't usually do cover songs,  but this one,  this one's very special to me.  So I brought the,  one of the co-authors of FBA,  Mike DiNicolo.  Mike DiNicolo!  Mike DiNicolo!  Mike has been kind enough  to write a little extension to the song,  so if you listen closely, 
[00:03:30]  you might hear some things  you haven't heard before.  Down to my target weight  Sarcoma popped out  all over my face  I lost three teeth  and all of my friends  Looks like this song  I'm nearing the end  of your name  No need to lie,  no reason to fear  When you're flat on your back 
[00:04:00]  counting all your ribs  I went to give blood  They just showed me the door  I stood up to leave  And I fell on the floor  full-blown  Everybody now!  Damn that whore!  Damn that whore!  I said, damn that whore!  Yeah!  Damn that whore!  Let's break it down now. 
[00:04:30]  Mike DiNicolo's gonna do  a little spoken word.  A little poetry.  Cause I know you guys  can appreciate some good poetry, right?  Well, the FBA has sent in  and he's left feeling a little low.  Here you go, Mike.  Well, now I've got AIDS.  I don't feel so good.  So I'm gonna go out  and share it  with my neighborhood.  Bartender, waitress,  here's your tip. 
[00:05:00]  That ain't acne  above my lip.  Oh, you have to leave?  No?  That's okay.  I've got time to kill.  Maybe two or three days.  I'm sitting alone  humming this song.  I start to think about  everyone who's done me wrong.  Who's done you wrong?  My fifth grade teacher.  Yeah?  Mr. Beck.  You're gonna find a hypodermic  in your neck.  Hey, it's in my restaurant. 
[00:05:30]  What about him?  The tip's blue.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But I ain't half and half  in your stew.  Oh!  And Wendy,  you remember me.  Wendy?  Yeah.  She stood me up for prom.  But I won't infect her.  You won't infect her?  I'm gonna infect her mom.  Her mom?  Still blown AIDS.  Damn that whore!  Damn that whore! 
[00:06:00]  You little fucking whore!  You little mother fucking whore!  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  F-b-a.  F-b-a.  F-b-a.  F-b-a-t.  I try!  F-b-a-t.  Alright, now we can start the show.  That was a close F word there.  Yeah.  You barely got rid of the F.  Top notch, top notch 
[00:06:30]  Oh, thank you  Somebody is sending me all these spoilers to Star Wars  There we go  Let me read him here  He didn't do a good job of it, first of all  Because I knew what happened in the movie anyway  But he, like, numbers them all  So I know, like, by the first sentence that it's going to be a spoiler  So he thought he was ruining it for me, but he didn't 
[00:07:00]  No  And I really don't care  It's not, it's a prequel to a movie that we've seen a million times  It's not like there's these secrets that are going to  Uh-oh, Anakin is who?  We already know how this is going to end  Yeah, it doesn't matter  He's telling me who, like, gets killed and whose head gets chopped  Who cares?  One of the New York papers giving it only two stars, by the way  Really?  Saying way too much action and not much substance as far as the story goes  Who cares?  Yeah, that's what you'll want is the action  I just want action 
[00:07:30]  Well, Star Wars fans are bitching, they're bitching a little bit  They're geeks  All right, Anthony, so let's get back to the Eddie the murderer thing  So we can wrap that up  Please  Uh, we also have a, uh, a news clip  Another news clip  Channel 9 decided to run with the story, Adam  Channel 9, the only, uh, station that actually went with the goddamn story  I think they were so happy we gave them a plug for their, um  Son of Sam thing  Did you watch some of that?  That was great  It was pretty cool  You know, I was talking the other day about how some people, uh, turn into completely different people 
[00:08:00]  Than they were when they were younger  He's one of those guys  Like, he doesn't even look like the same guy  And, uh, he, the way he speaks  You just don't think it's the same guy  Son of Sam  And then they have the split screen  They show, uh, the picture of when he was arrested  Yeah  And he just looks like a raving lunatic  Yeah  And then the guy they're talking to  Like they said last night  It could be any guy walking down the streets of Manhattan  Absolutely  You could bump into a guy like this  Very soft-spoken  And he's one of those cases  I, I believe  Now, now, don't get me wrong  I think the guy should spend the rest of his life in prison 
[00:08:30]  And it should be horrible  He killed people  There's no taking that back  But he's the kind of guy that I guess went through a, a time in his life  Where he just lost his effing mind  And decided to kill people  But now, I bet you, if you let him out  He would just be another ordinary guy on the street  Living an ordinary life somewhere  And never again do any, uh, anybody harm  Doesn't he just seem like that?  I'm sure there are crazier people on the streets of Manhattan  Oh, right  Right now  Millions  You kidding? 
[00:09:00]  But he just doesn't look like  Son of Sam, David Berkowitz  You see that nasty scar?  Ah, yeah  On the neck  You stab someone in the neck  You kill them  Come on  Right to the jugular  Yeah  And the guy lives  How do you screw that one up?  That scar's really old now  And it looks, it looks fresh like it was done a month ago  All puffy and pink  Mmm  You could tell that was a deep, deep cause  Oh, yeah  Anyway, so Channel 9 helped us out  Because they promoted this, uh, Son of Sam  Exclusive interview like crazy for their May Sweeps  Right, so I guess they felt they owed it to us 
[00:09:30]  Felt I owed it to them  And right after that, they had our, uh, they had our little Eddie the murderer thing  Yes  All wrapped up nicely  All wrapped up  News likes things that are all wrapped up nicely  No loose ends, right?  Sure  Cause, you know, I went home yesterday going, you know what?  God  We had all these TV crews  Mm-hmm  And they all buried it  No one else ran with the story  Well, you know what?  If we were, um, trying to pull a fast one on people 
[00:10:00]  We would have handled it differently  If, if this was something we had planned  The smart move, if you want to get the most exposure out of this  Would have been  To not mention how kooky Eddie was  And not put him on the air  Not put him back on the air to confess that he was, uh, uh, he's a kook on, uh, what drug did he say he was on?  Uh, Zola  The Zola  You know, and let the, uh, news run with the stories  And then today expose it  And have it work that way 
[00:10:30]  You know, unfortunately, uh, unfortunately we didn't plan this  Could have gotten more mileage out of it  As the radio whores that we are  Yeah, we did a lot of interviews yesterday too, man  I know  But Channel 9, they ran with it because they got the exclusive  Because, uh, Bob O'Brien was in the studio  When Eddie decided to let everyone in on the fact that he really is a nut  And I, I should explain  The detectives pressured Eddie big time  And said, look, stop messing or we're bringing you downtown 
[00:11:00]  You get back on that show  And you tell him you're a nutcase and you're on the Zola  Yep  Not making any lies  Because that, that turned out to be what the case, you know, what it was  Right, exactly  And that's why he called up all sweating, you know, sweating and stuff  And said what he said  Live, uh, while Channel 9 was rolling  Yeah, called up, uh, live with that one  So, uh, you want  And the post actually ran something too  They had a follow-up that they had to run  Yeah, well, we'll start with the Channel 9 thing  Because we started with that  Mm-hmm  Um, if you saw the Channel 9 piece  Stinky, uh, didn't get credit for being the phone man 
[00:11:30]  No, uh  And Stinky's okay with that  Stinky's fine with it  I didn't want to be on television  You know, he has Club Stinky to run  He doesn't want people, uh, asking him for  Backstairs passes  Uh, out on the street  You know what it would be like?  Who was that guy?  Remember the guy that owned Studio 54?  Steve Rebell  Steve Rebell  He couldn't go out  People always bugging him to get in  I understand Stinky's point of view there  If he walks the street 
[00:12:00]  If he's on the news  Oh, you're awesome, Garrett  Please  Club awesome  I gotta get in  I gotta bring my people there  Can I get past the velvet ropes  And the firehose  So you saw John answering the phones last night  Yes, that is who you saw  John  Had his big line  You want to do it for us live  Here on the air, John?  O&A, what's your name?  Hey, that's it  You're the guy  You're the guy  You're the guy  Wow  I only answer phones with live TV coverage  Right  You absolutely did  And, uh, you were on TV  Dude, you were so playing up to the camera, too 
[00:12:30]  Isn't that great?  You knew that camera was over your shoulder  Absolutely  He's sitting up all, you know, straight and happy  Yes  O&A  May I help you?  So this is, uh, the report that Channel 9 did last night  Right after the Son of Sam interview  Yes  The Opie and Anthony radio show took a very serious turn this week  A caller made a chilling confession to murder  But, was it real?  Bob O'Brien is here with the story for us  Bob  Brenda, Opie and Anthony have parlayed outrageous banter 
[00:13:00]  Into one of radio's biggest success stories  On the air, live, in 21 cities, from coast to coast  But, for the last two days  One of their callers wasted an outrageous amount of the NYPD's time  By claiming he'd murdered two men with a high-powered rifle back in 1977  And never got caught  All calls to the Opie and Anthony show are screened as they come in  But neither Greg, Opie Hughes, nor Anthony Cumia  Were prepared to have a caller claim he shot two men to death back in 1977 
[00:13:30]  During a drug deal gone bad  Listen to the tape of yesterday's conversation with a man calling himself Eddie  You shot two drug dealer guys  I shot the other two animals  And, and, uh, did you hit, and did you kill them both?  Yes  You know, we're not used to, uh, people admitting to murders on this program  And, uh, he sounded crazy enough that he might have done it  He also sounded, uh, crazy enough that he might be delusional in believing that, uh, he did it  I gotta say, I think the guy's just a kook 
[00:14:00]  You don't believe he did it?  Ah, I'm not buying it anymore  After three detectives from the NYPD Cold Case Squad visited Eddie at his Ridgewood Queens home  They weren't buying his story either  But throughout the Opie and Anthony show today, Eddie kept calling  Trying to get himself out of the mess he'd created  Bob O'Brien, I'm gonna give you an exclusive  Eddie is calling us right now  Eddie is here  Let's see what he has to say  Eddie!  Hey, what's up?  You got, uh, Channel 9 News listening to you right now  Alright, I'm a kook  I'm a, and I'm on Zoloft 
[00:14:30]  That's all I got to say  Okay?  Bye  As far as NYPD spokesman, Michael O'Looney is concerned  There was nothing okay about Eddie's radio hoax  O'Looney calls it a waste of valuable police resources  That needlessly had three Cold Case Squad detectives working two days on a total hoax  That's great  Classic, right?  Yeah  Alright  Yeah, they had the standard shots  I mean, do they have to come in and tape the meters again on the board? 
[00:15:00]  Just flipping  When they play the audio from the show  All you see are the meters on the board  Moving  With the little needles flopping around  And the on-the-air light  We need the on-the-air  Can't you just go to your own studios there?  That they run your news in and tape the on-the-air light there?  Who's gonna know?  Hey, that's the Channel 9 on the air light  That isn't the, uh, Opie and Anthony on the air light  Same shots 
[00:15:30]  So today  Nothing new there  Today a lot of the media outlets are trying to spin it another way  Now they're convinced you and I were in on it  Yeah  The whole time  That's what they're saying now  A lot of people saying, uh, we were in on this  Prove it  You're gonna find nothing  No  We burnt the preparation for this gag  And buried it in a marsh somewhere  You know, I think we said this on the air yesterday  We found out the detectives when they went over to Eddie's place yesterday  Yeah  Finally  Uh, that Eddie, uh, welcomed them at the door with just a Giants jersey on 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, just a Giants jersey  Pretty much his yam bag and his junk just hanging out for the detectives  He's nutty as a fruitcake  And, uh, from what I hear, there was just a shrine to the station here in New York  To us  And, yeah, well, he had wows all over the place  And, uh, the phone number to, uh, reach us here at the station  Written on every wall  Like, so that if he ever needed to call and he was facing the kitchen wall  He wouldn't have to turn  He could just do it right there and then  Right 
[00:16:30]  So, uh, an article ran in the New York Post, Anthony  Uh, the headline  Radio killer confesses to lie  A day after confessing to a double murder on the Opie and Anthony radio show  A Queens man returned to the air to recant saying he lied  The caller identified by, uh, N.E.W. as Eddie  Told Opie and Anthony  Uh, three detectives quizzed him on his claim to have killed two people in Brooklyn 25 years ago  I didn't kill nobody, Eddie said yesterday  When he called the show 
[00:17:00]  I lied  Eddie said the cold case cops who paid him a visit were nice guys asking a whole bunch of questions  Of course they asked a whole bunch of questions, you doof  Their advice to Eddie, they told me to stay off the radio  And he didn't follow that advice yesterday either  Well, how did we find that out?  He called us here and told us live on the radio  Yeah  That they told him not to call and talk on the radio  After doing another 20 or 30 minutes with us yesterday  He said, well, they told me to stay off the radio  Yeah  Detectives, uh, previously went to N.E.W. Midtown Studio 
[00:17:30]  And pulled the tape of Eddie's confession and paperwork relating to his call  Yeah, it turns out, I guess, that he ended up a contest with another show here in New York  Yeah, and so we had all his info  And we gave the info to the detective  And they went over there  Proper thought  I'm not a kook, Eddie insisted on the air yesterday  Co-host, uh, Kumia disagreed  I think you're completely nuts, he told Eddie  The Ridgewood man told Opie and Anthony on Tuesday  He shot two men in an East New York warehouse in 1977 during a drug deal  Used gasoline to burn the bodies in a marsh 
[00:18:00]  And then threw some of the remains into garbage trucks in Manhattan's meatpacking district  Police said they had no record of a double homicide  Fitting that description, but checked out Eddie's claim anyway  Uh, Eddie refused to speak with a Post reporter  But his mother  My favorite quote of the whole article  Said her son is disabled and doesn't go out much  Adding, who's he supposed to murder?  Who is he supposed to murder?  He got his mom  Oh, you want to hear another twist of this? 
[00:18:30]  Poor old woman  You know we're on in, uh, 21 cities?  Yeah  One of our program directors  Uh-huh  Is convinced  Convinced  That Eddie really did it  Really?  Hmm, I wonder which one that is  And he's a bigwig  I would have said it was, uh, Tom from New Orleans  And I said, and I, I had to go, stop, stop  Just stop it  Stop it now  Just, now you're talking crazy  Yeah  He's convinced, though  Now he thinks that, uh, because of the heat that the detectives put on this, this guy  Uh-huh  He decided, you know, he got panicky and said, okay, look, I'm a kook 
[00:19:00]  And I'm on the solo  But he really didn't  He's convinced, dude  I'm not going to say who it is, but is he convinced the bodies are in a secret room?  No?  Maybe?  Perhaps?  Yeah?  All right  So then I picked out a couple more articles on this thing  We're wrapping this up finally  Where people are, uh, accusing us, hope  Now, uh, the Boston Herald decided right on this  Uh-huh  We did an interview with Dean Johnson before the show yesterday 
[00:19:30]  Uh, I, I noticed Dean, uh, doesn't have the balls to call our show  Dean, what did you do?  Like we said, uh, 15 minutes ago  How many times do we have to just repeat that to him?  Which we did, because he asked us time and time again  Come on, guys, is this a hoax?  Are you pulling a fast one?  He didn't get the answer he wanted, so he, see, he kind of  Yeah  Made up some stuff in his little article  Uh-huh  We said many times  We said it from the beginning  And I want to make this perfectly clear  We said this guy is, uh, either telling the truth 
[00:20:00]  Or believes he's telling the truth  Or he's absolutely out of his effing mind  We used the word delusional many, many times  Yes  Okay  Pull the tape if you don't believe us  Actually, we're going to replay it, I think, Saturday  During our best of here in New York  So, uh, and Dean kept pressing and pressing  And we're like, Dean, you know what?  It's what it is  This thing fell on our lap and we ran with it  Right  You know  Uh, so his headline  Opie and Anthony fend off charges of killer hoax  Ooh  We're not fending it off to anyone 
[00:20:30]  Fend off charges of killer hoax  Who are we fending off there, Dean?  We're fending off stupid, uh, journalists  That are making up, uh, lies  There you go  And then he writes, uh, did a caller admit to it, uh, committing a double murder  On Opie and Anthony's nationally syndicated show  Heard locally on BCN  Or did the pair stage an elaborate prank  In the middle of radio's most important rating season  Oh, oh  What the hell was that? 
[00:21:00]  That's me going, oh, oh, did we, oh  You can make up conspiracy theories for anything, I'm convinced now  Now, he really didn't, uh, do I have that story here anywhere?  No  Did he give the other option?  No  That perhaps the guy is a kook  And it wasn't true, but  Not  It wasn't us that  Not really  No  Not really  Like it's either the guy murdered somebody  Or we did a hoax 
[00:21:30]  No, here's his  This is what he says, Anthony, okay?  Opie and Anthony say no  The New York police disagree  Yeah  Huh?  The police have not come to us once and said  Look, you guys, you know  We're in on this  Yeah  So where did he get that from?  The New York police disagree  Come on, Dean  That means the Dean is saying that the police think that we're in on this  Yeah  That's wrong, Dean  Tuesday, about 5.30, a caller named Eddie 
[00:22:00]  Meticulously described the way he allegedly murdered, dismembered, and disposed of the bodies of two Colombian drug dealers in 1977  Doesn't it sound more ridiculous when you say it now than it did when he said it?  Yeah  Two Colombian drug dealers  Ugh, please  Like something out of Grand Theft Auto 3  Exactly  And then he has to add this, of course  Because they can't write an article in Boston, I should say, without mentioning this, Anthony  Back in 1998, Opie and Anthony were fired for making a prank April Fool's Day announcement that Boston Bayer Tom Benito had been killed in a Florida car accident 
[00:22:30]  Oh  And then he writes, was it deja vu all over again?  Don't you, and then this is Anthony's quote  Don't you think we've learned our lesson about faking deaths on the radio?  Anthony told the Herald yesterday, shortly before going on the air  I add, I think we've done enough radio by now to know when some guy is pulling our leg  Yeah, that was part of a very long explanation after I said, look, Dean, I'm going to say it again 
[00:23:00]  The guy either did this or believes he did this  And he's a kook  Or he's absolutely delusional and he's a kook  But he just throws that in like, you know, this guy pulled a fast one on us, possibly  And NYPD spokesman said detectives investigated the caller  And his claim was a complete hoax  Eddie was back on the air yesterday and denied everything, he said Tuesday  Just to keep everybody off my back  Is what Eddie is being quoted as saying  Yeah  After that conversation, Opie and Anthony dismissed him as a kook, a crazy person  And then he writes, were they in on the scam? 
[00:23:30]  They played the innocent victims yesterday, but if they weren't, there could be trouble  Oh, now he has to speculate  There could be trouble for us, Anthony  And then he ends the article with, the FCC takes these things very seriously  And they could be disciplined by both the FCC and the station if they were aware  It was a hoax, said attorney and local talk show host Stephen Weissman  Who?  Who the F is he?  Who?  Attorney  He's an attorney and a talk show host?  And a talk show host, all in love 
[00:24:00]  But I believe they're both perfect gentlemen  So Dean's pretty much making up his own story  Yeah  There's that line, he goes  Did a caller admit to committing a double murder on Opie and Anthony's show?  Or did they stage a prank?  So either he admitted to the murder, which really happened  Or it's a prank that we staged  Right  There's no other option there  And the other option we gave him  That the guy is delusional  Yeah  Said it a million times to cover our asses 
[00:24:30]  Nah, that doesn't make a good enough story for Dean, I guess  I see  And then, uh  This one's quick and then we'll finally move on to other things  There's something that goes to pretty much every radio station in America, Anthony  Yeah  It's called M Street Daily  And they're writing on it  And these guys are in the radio business  This is embarrassing  Did Opie and Anthony get scammed by a phony murder confession?  Hopefully they did, because things could get ugly if they were in on it 
[00:25:00]  Oh  It could, could it?  To all these idiot journalists  Give us a call  We'll give you Eddie's address  You go over there  And then you'll be convinced the guy is just a kook, you idiot  Yeah, quiz him  And see how we all got together to plan this  You'll be sitting there going  Just, oh boy, okay  Just make sure he puts all his clothes on before you get there  You might be a little shocked  Bring an ice cream cone for him before you go in 
[00:25:30]  Maybe that'll calm him down  Maybe take him on a ride on the first wheel  Yeah  And then, uh, the M Street rides  A decade ago, an L.A. station endured a famous murder phone call hoax that involved station personnel  And that did happen in L.A. with, I believe, Kevin and Bean  Yeah  They were in on something like this, big time  Yeah, they made up a huge story about a crime that was committed  And a murder, and, uh, and, uh, the guy, uh, was on the phone with them  And, uh, and it turned out that they put the whole thing together  And the case was on America's Most Wanted 
[00:26:00]  It was a really big deal  Yeah, they really  For this radio station  We need your help to catch this scumbag  For that, I should say, for that radio station and for that, uh, morning show  Yeah  And it, uh, you know, the company was not happy in the end  And it's pretty serious, uh, business when you mess around with these fake hoaxes, Anthony  All right  How come it's Greg Opie Hughes and not Anthony Anthony Cumia?  You know?  When I was doing radio in Rochester, that was my name 
[00:26:30]  Greg Opie Hughes  Yeah, and then my PD's like, look, dude  Greg Hughes is a pretty good radio name  And Opie's not bad, you know  Crap, but get off the pod  Pick one  So figure one out  So I went with the one that I shouldn't have went with  Because now I hate my name  You went with Opie  Oh, it made sense when you're 22  All right, uh, here's the case file on the Opie and Anthony  Homicide, Anthony  Homicide  During Total Truth Tuesday  Did we do a bit called Total Truth Tuesday?  Wait a minute  What? 
[00:27:00]  It says that?  And this is a publication that goes to every radio station in America  Where did he get his info?  We, we do a bit like that?  No, we don't do a bit like that  I, I don't remember that  Total Truth Tuesday  Hey, shut up, that's a great bit  I'm gonna start it  You would think these guys, you know, they're so connected to the radio business  They would do a little more research than someone like Dean Johnson from the Boston Herald  We don't do a Total Truth Tuesday 
[00:27:30]  What a lame sounding gag that is  Here's the case file on the Opie and Anthony homicide  During Total Truth Tuesday  Someone out there in Radioland remember that for Tuesday  Because now we're gonna goof on it  We gotta do it now  A caller named Eddie spun a lurid tale about killing two Colombian drug dealers in 1977  ONA quizzed him about the grisly details of how he disposed of the bodies  It involved grinding up body parts  And Eddie had all the answers  The press went nuts  The story hit the New York Post  And Cable's New York One 
[00:28:00]  NYPD detectives visited N.E.W. to listen to a tape of the show  Anthony Comey had told the Post  We're not making this up and it's not a bit  When he said murder, my head spun around  Which is the truth  Yeah, we were like, whoa  Yeah, a little shot  But on yesterday's show, Eddie claimed everything he'd said was a lie  It's an uncomfortable spot for him  Getting police attention and Opie and Anthony and all  Their 1999 April Fools hoax was about Boston Mayor Menino dying in a car accident  Still hangs over Beantown 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, well, they don't want to check facts  Yeah, don't let facts get in the way of a good story  It really was 98  M Street thinks it's 99  But they also think we do a bit called Total Truth Tuesday  A fabricated story  The one thing I've learned doing radio this long, Anthony  You cannot believe everything you read  No, I read the paper now  Or see  I go, I don't believe it  Just because of the crap they have done to us over the years  And we're just dopey radio 
[00:29:00]  Imagine like the real stories  When they want to get the story out before they have all the facts  Right  A little scary  So, you know what?  We have to put an end to Eddie the murderer  Yep  That's it  There's going to be a bunch of media outlets out there  Trying to find something on us  That we were involved  That we were connected to Eddie the murderer  Well, you got the idea  You got the best idea  I wish you a lot of luck  Just go over to Eddie's house  Any news organization that wants 
[00:29:30]  You go there  And look him in those cuckoo eyes  That I'm sure he has  That spin like pinwheels in the wind  And you ask him  You interview him  Try to break this wide open  And have him crack about how we all are in on this  And go through the planning phase with Eddie and everything  Good luck  You'll be running out of the house going  Cuckoo, cuckoo  I did another interview with the Friday morning quarterback today  Yeah  They're trying to pick apart our story 
[00:30:00]  You're going to find nothing  Good luck to you  That's right  That's what it was, man  A kook  That told a really good story  And we bought it  Definitely in the beginning  Uh-huh  We definitely bought it  But we said from the beginning  And I'm going to say it again  The guy is either telling the truth  Or he's delusional  Uh-huh  We covered our asses  So go ahead  Find something  All right  We have lots to do today, Ant  Yeah  Uh, Mario Cantone, uh, checking in today 
[00:30:30]  He is  Steven Lynch, uh, checking in today, I believe, right?  Yes  We got to talk about the softball game  It's just about sold out  Another meeting today about it  Look at us  Actually planning something  This thing looks like it's going to be organized for once  Yeah  And we're really excited  Because it's the first time we've, uh, done a big event  In, uh, you know what?  In almost a year  Yeah, quite a while  In New York  We've done some benefits here and there  And little things, you know  Support Dice, support Jimmy when he was doing his thing  Yeah  And Jay, uh, Jay Moore  Well, we haven't really  And then we've had some beers with the listeners 
[00:31:00]  But nothing really big  How come Dice isn't part of our celebrity softball game?  Because it's all about him  I thought because it's about celebrities  Oh  Do you see the list of celebrities we got?  I know  That's even worse  I wish we had a Dice  Who would have thunk?  No, but it's all about him, Anthony  I know  It's always been about him  I mean, we love  We love the guy  But, you know, when it comes down to actually doing something for us  Right  You know  You gave him a call, right? 
[00:31:30]  I didn't even bother  Because we already  We already know how he is  Yeah  You know  We're there for him  I can't make it  We're there for him  I'm busy that day  Doing what?  I'm gardening  Right  He's got plans  We'll talk about that  Also, I think when we get back in  We've got to get right into it  Nude  Teen  Slumber Party  Nude  Teen  Slumber Party  And Ann Landers' shocking answer

No one's having nude  Teen  Slumber Parties  Can we just think about it  Oh, for a few fleeting moments  We've had some new teen parties  New teen slumber parties  But they're not doing this in the real world  I don't know  Maybe we should hold one

Be quiet  I had one when I was a little girl  I love it  What's with that marriage?  What do you mean?  He's my husband  And I love him  It seems more like  Some kind of  He might be a beard there, Liza  Yeah  No, he's not a beard 
[00:56:00]  He doesn't have a beard  He's clean-shaven  No, you know, beard  He's beautiful  Woody, I shave too  Just because I'm part Italian  I don't have a beard  We hear he should have  His mouth open  Oh, that's not true  It just doesn't seem  Like a traditional marriage  In the traditional sense  Of the word  It seems like there's  An ulterior motive there  Oh, Larry  Let's talk about my father  Vincent Minnelli  I saw the Larry King  Oh, Larry  You're Larry King  Oh, Larry  You know, Larry  You had a great party for  Larry  We were in London 
[00:56:30]  And I was in my limousine  It was right after  We did your show  And this beautiful urbanite  Came up to the window  And I rolled down the window  Because I thought  He wanted an autograph  And he stole the ice  Off my chest  Right  That's what the kids  Call diamonds ice  He stole the ice  I said, David  That beautiful ice cross  He stole it  So David got out of the car  And he ran after him  And he kept running  And running  And running  And then he ran out of breath  And he came back  And he said  I didn't get your ice  He said  Someone's walking around  Right now

[01:10:00]  I don't think  Anybody's ticked off  Really  Look you know what  You're not going to get  That type of information  And I'm telling you the truth  I don't think  I don't think any of them  Are upset  I think that they're  You know  They're doing what  They have to do  Is it Matthews  Of course it's Matthews  I'm just asking  I saw the other night  She looks beautiful  She looks great  Is she glowing  With pregnancy  She's glowing  She's beautiful  Oh by the way  I was at the movies yesterday  And I saw Jim Norton  In Spider-Man  In Spider-Man  Spider-Man  How funny is that  Where are you coming from  Spider-Man  Nobody knows who you are 
[01:10:30]  Okay have you seen  Cheers  Is M2 playing that one  I've seen the video  It's the buildings  The video's beautiful  The buildings are all  Constructed in front of 
[01:11:00]  Your very eyes  But she's like  Her face is tight  The licks are full  The face is tight  Is it good though  Or like when she was  Doing those infomercials  And she looked like  The Sphinx  She was like  You know what  She's on David Letterman  That's all David Letterman  Is ever said to her  Was like  You look great  And it's like  You look like  A wax figure  Out of Adam Tussauds  One more facelift  And she's going to have  That goatee  The goatee  And bad breath  But I've got to say  She sounds pretty good  I'm not a fan of her  But she sounds good  In that song  Yeah  You're not a fan of Cher 
[01:11:30]  No I'm not  I don't  Give me your card  I'm ripping it up  They hate me for it  Your card to the gay community  They hate me for it  Because you know  Mario's gay  First of all  I love lesbian audience  You guys  I love lesbian audience  Please bring more  More more  I want to smell the air  I remember that day  I remember that day  We had girls  In this studio  I don't even know  How many  Talk about being  Just brushed aside  Never mind  Vanilla ice  But a lesbian audience  It was a daisy chain 
[01:12:00]  Of naked women  Just going at each other  People going at it  Yeah  And there were contraptions  We put you in  The most uncomfortable position  Oh it was  Because also one of the girls  Would go  Mario can you pass the dildo  And he's like  Oh my gosh  He's like  But the room  The room filled up  With a wafting scent  Of womanly fragrances  Hold on one second  Wait  Can I get some water  It was womanly aromas  And fragrances  Were just filling this room 
[01:12:30]  To where  If you walked out  Of the studio  To go to the bathroom  And you come back in  So you've had some  Fresh air to breathe  And you came back  And it was like  Whoa  It was a nice potpourri  That was a potpourri  Of a  A potpourri  Low tide on Fire Island  Yeah  That was like  Ouch  It doesn't smell like  Any potpourri  I had before  But Mario's just  Completely disgusted  Picture walking into  A room  Of steaming man-ass  Opie  And just  Getting a  Whiff  What would you do 
[01:13:00]  Nothing  Because you smell  Your man-ass  Every day  Shut up  I'm just  I'm trying to  Give it to Opie  In a way  That he would understand  I mean you're not  A dog or anything  But you know  No  But I'm just saying  You try  You gotta keep that clean  Yeah that would be  A little wrong  Can I tell you my theory  On the whole thing  Yes Mario Cantone  I'm gonna tell you  On lesbians or  No on the whole  Sexuality thing  I'm gonna tell you  Finally enlighten us  We're ignorant  When it comes to that  No I was saying  Really  I don't think you're funny  I just love that catchphrase  I don't think you're funny you guys 
[01:13:30]  I just look at it this way  Look  This is the thing  You know  I mean  If you're a gay man  Right  And you've never been with a woman  You've never had sex with a woman  That  The female body  Is a completely foreign thing  To you  Like alien  It's like  No it's not  Like alien  I thought so  You ever see when that thing  Opened up  The egg  And the thing jumped out  It kind of looks like that  The first time  You're scared of it  You sound like a gay guy  Grabs you by the face  So anyway  But you have a male organ  So it's not foreign to you 
[01:14:00]  Not that you want to do anything  With someone else  But I'm saying  But it's not foreign  It's not foreign to you  Do you get my point  I'm trying to get your point  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  So you're saying  If you crank  If you crank it  Yeah  As a guy  Yeah  And you do that thing  You know what it is  It's a little  You might as well  It's more familiar to you  Than to someone  Who is completely  Homosexual  But you had your mom's boobs  When you were younger  Yeah  I had the formula bottle  Thank you very much  My mother was like 
[01:14:30]  No  My mother was like  You are not  Stucking on my breath  Forget it  She's like  Get out of here  I'm giving you the formula  You're getting the formula  That's not normal  Breast speed  It is not normal  This is killing  In Boston right now  That's not normal  That's not normal  To breast speed  Hey  In the 1940s  50s and 60s  We did not breast speed  It was not normal  What we did  When we burnt houses down  For the insurance money  That was normal  I don't understand 
[01:15:00]  Your point on this though  Just because  You have  The male anatomy  As a male  Whether you're  Homosexual  Heterosexual  And you have it  That doesn't mean  You know  Or you're familiar  With what it would be  To be with another man  With the same anatomy  I agree with you there  That's an insane prospect  My point is  Is that it's not  As foreign to you  As it is to someone  That has never been  With a woman  I'm trying to 
[01:15:30]  Concentrate on it  What I'm saying  Is you're more likely  To put your hand  Down a guy's pants  Than for some  Gay guy  To put the hand  Down a woman's pants  That's what I'm saying  Oh what  See we're  No not  Oh I'm  Wait wait wait  Not you  I'm just saying  That I don't think  We're trying to  Have to be the right guy  Is it as fearful  And it has to be hung  Alright this is too serious  See  Huge time queen  Look at us  Trying to understand each other  It never works  Why do we go down this road  It's alright  I love you guys 
[01:16:00]  And it doesn't matter  We understand each other  That's all  That's all  Needs to happen  That's right  Hey look you know what  I'm not going to try  To figure you out  No and I have  Figured you out  You and your  Riveting theater etiquette  Alright look  Nothing like theater etiquette  We got to take a break  This is fun today  Yes  You're killing today  I'm having a good time today  Because the last time  I was depressed when I left  Save some stuff  For after the break  I'm going to say something  And knowing you  You're going to jump right into it  No I won't  But save it  Someone wants to hear  Your Shelly Winters  Alright  You do it after the break  Alright  We have another guy

[01:24:30]  I gotta get Mario's reaction  Ah Jim  I really gotta get Mario's reaction  You'll get my reaction Jim  Alright guys I'm gonna go listen to myself twice  Alright and explain  This was our great new idea  Now it's a pretty conventional idea  Make it quick  It's a pretty conventional idea in this business  One of the hottest things  But you might have heard something like this in the past  As a matter of fact  You ever hear the radio giveaways  Where they put a lucky contestant 
[01:25:00]  In a vault with money  And they have a limited time  To grab as much as they can  Yeah  Or they have them in that big plexiglass tube  And the wind blows  And they gotta grab as much money as they can  You gotta do that with change prices?  We did that with ten girls  So you grab as many women as you can?  No no no  We threw money all over this studio  And the women have to catch this money  No no no  They didn't have to catch it  They could pick it up with their hands  And they were  Oh they were completely nude girls by the way  Not a stitch of clothing on them  And they ran around 
[01:25:30]  Grabbing up this money  Oh how original  You don't think that's cool?  I think that's so original  Well the  Oh god I forgot one thing  What?  Sorry I had to dump out of that  He just said the C word in front of me  He said the C word in front of me  And I don't mean canto  I just wanted to see your face  I can't believe  I can't believe you said  That was like  That was like a cannonball  Coming at my face  I know  It shocks people  It shocks me  Well you said it was no big deal  So we threw in the twist  Yeah that's the twist 
[01:26:00]  Well don't  Don't describe it  Don't even describe it  Alright god alright  You know what it is  It's not like you're having an orgasm  You know what I mean  You're like Speed Racer over there  Oh Trixie  Oh oh oh  Oh chip chip  We want to be able  We want to be able to do this  We want to be able to do this game  To do it again  So we can never say that the twist is  But that's it  How about that huh?  What do you think?  Hot right?  Doesn't that make sense now  That your parents always told you  Don't put that money in your mouth  You don't know where it's been  Yeah  Yes  I don't think I'd be putting that money in my mouth 
[01:26:30]  No  No  No  No  No  No  No  Oh Trixie  Oh  Show Speed  You hurt yourself  Trixie  Get me the Ace bandage  Oh  I don't know how he used to do that  Okay Speed  Your car is ready  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  Oh  You know what Mario would say  If he put that money in his mouth?  What?  What is this?  Foreign money?  Oh  Well that was quite witty of you  Thank you for coming up with that  Have one a day 
[01:27:00]  You too  That was very good  There you go  There's my line for today  Someone asked me to do Shelley Winters  So I have to do it  Oh yeah  Shelley Winters  Shelley Winters of course  We loved her in  The Poseidon Adventure  Did you see  I was inside the actor's studio  And with James Lipton  And I was telling them  I had Thanksgiving with Al Pacino and Bobby De Niro  And Al got there for  And he ate all the damn turkey 
[01:27:30]  And then Bobby De Niro came over  And he said  Did you  Did you eat my turkey?  Did you eat my turkey?  But  But  But  But  But  I said  That was Al  That  He said  Shelly  Could you please  Give us the honor  Of doing some of the dialogue  From that great movie  The Poseidon Adventure  You know  I  I  I  I  I gained a lot of weight  From that picture  I was sitting before  I  I used to look like Marilyn  I used to look like Marilyn 
[01:28:00]  Right  You were definitely a looker  Marilyn got her looking for me  Marilyn  Marilyn got her looking for me  Marilyn  And I was fat  Yeah I have a sculpture  Of my torso  Before that picture  I was kidding  I used to look like Marilyn  I'm a fat  I'm a fat  Shakespearean  Actors  Wanted me  Who plowed every leading man  I've ever been with  She was a goer  I did them all  I did Kurt  Burt Lancaster  Kurt Douglas  Laura McCall  I did them all 
[01:28:30]  Do just one line  From the Poseidon Adventure  Mrs. Peter Pan  I'm not  Manny  Manny  Give this medal  To the kids  Manny  I can swim  I can swim  I got a medal  I can  I can get  And then here's the heart attack scene  Big splash  You rock  I love her in that  Man  Did you ever see her in a place in the sun  When she was like younger and thinner 
[01:29:00]  She played the very dowdy looking woman  Who was in love with Montgomery Clift  She was quite the hottie  I just look like Marilyn  Let me go to Samantha  She has a question for her  Mario Cantone  Samantha what's up  I just want to ask Mario a question  What dear  Were you ever with a woman  Ever with a woman  Like sexually  In the biblical sense  You mean like  Was I ever like actually  With a woman  Yeah in there  Like you know  Let me answer it by  Just saying this  Samantha  Uh huh 
[01:29:30]  I have another question  I've made out with many a woman  My friend  Oh yeah  My friend Kim C  I make out with her all the time  Yeah gay guys love to make out  With this great girlfriend  Yeah I love  I love making out with women  And my friend Kim C  Her breasts are beautiful  I mean they're amazing  She's got beautiful breasts  Did you get turned on by the boobs  No  Not really  But she  No  Not really  No they're beautiful  Aesthetically  I mean they're beautiful  But you make out with girls 
[01:30:00]  And is that a turn on  No  I made out with her  At an Eric Benet concert  And we were just like making out  It was just fun  Well we were drunk  We were making out  You know  Can I ask one more question  You can't ask  I just want to know  When you're going to talk  About cheating at work  I think that was from  Tuesday's show  Oh my god  That's right  Oh yeah  Cheating at work  Cheating at work  What does that mean  We have  We have ADD I think  You should do that  We start so many subjects  And never get to the end  Well you know what  The whole point is  We're supposed to do  The teen slumber party  We're supposed to talk about 
[01:30:30]  Me modeling in Rochester  Oh the modeling  We're supposed to talk about  Cheating at work  Feeling hot hot hot  Smiley me  Smiley me  That's all I want to do  Is general  You know what I want to ask  How's your sister doing Mario  Camille  No she's fine  She's very politically  Outspoken lately  I called her up the other day  First of all  This is her thing about  I asked her about  She was like  I go they got  You know they got  Robin Blake  She goes I knew  They were going to get  Robin Blake  I knew that was going to happen  But you know who  They didn't get  They did not get  William Shatner  I'm like I don't think 
[01:31:00]  He killed his wife  He killed his wife  I'm like how did he kill his wife  I'm going to tell you  How he killed his wife  She's hanging on to the pool  And he's above her  Stomping on her hands  Going  You are not getting my  Star Trek residuals  That's how he killed his wife  And I'm going to tell you  Something else  You know  This George W. Bush  You know  You can be sure of one thing  No one's doing him at all  So we're secure about 
[01:31:30]  That part of him  But I'm going to tell you  Something  What does the W stand for  That's what I want to know  I'm going to tell you  What the W stands for  What the hell  Is he doing it all  That's what the W stands for  How did he win  That's what the W stands for  That son of a bitch  She honestly does believe  That William Shatner  Yeah  Oh yeah  She's like  That did get skated right over  But you know  Who knows  I mean the Robert Blake thing 
[01:32:00]  Is kind of weird and obvious  It's like  It looks like she deserved it  Who  The wife  Really  Robert Blake's wife  Oh yeah  I absolutely believe that  Yeah  She did deserve it  She was a conniving worm  I swear  That's what I'm totally believing  And she probably  You know something  If you're going to kill  Your wife or whatever it is  She probably pushed you  To kill her  You don't just wake up  And go  You know  I'm so in love  I'm going to kill this bitch 
[01:32:30]  You've got to be pushed  And shoved  To the point  That you go to  Some Italian restaurant  Hallelujah  Shooter in the head  And come up with some  If I may say  Cockamamie story  About the gun  This is Barretta  For God's sake  I know he's done  All those brilliant plots  On Barretta  He couldn't come up  With someone else  He couldn't come up  With something  You can't come up  With like  I left my gun  Oh it was really here  So I didn't have it on me  And I  There are powder burns  On your hands  Scum  Oh alright 
[01:33:00]  Watch Law and Order  For Christ's sake  Anything  You know something  Anything  He broke all the rules  He had powder burns  On his hand  He filed off  The serial number  Of the gun  Which I think  A three year old  Knows that they have  Ways of getting  Raising back up  The serial number  No matter how much  You file it down  And oh lo and behold  They trace the gun  Back to him  He has that wacky story  About leaving his gun  In the restaurant  That's ridiculous  Coming back  And she's gone  You know  He tried to burn her  With an unlit cigarette  I said  It's ridiculous  These people are stupid 
[01:33:30]  Because he should have just  He was licensed  To carry a gun  Right  So you get in the car  With her  You go  Boom  You shoot her in the head  And you go  Oh my god  The gun went off  You run into the restaurant  Crying your eyes out  Going  It was an accident  Oh my god  I can't believe this  You know what happens  You have a trial  Perhaps  You get off  There's a shadow of doubt there  Right  There's that element of doubt  You don't try to  Cover it up  Like the OJ  Is another one  But how he got away  With that  I don't know how he got away 
[01:34:00]  See Robert Blake  Was too clean  You just gotta kill him  And go home  No story  No nothing  Jason Williams  With the change in the clothes  And then trying to say that  What did he say  That the guy shot himself  Or something  Oh please  Yeah you drive Jason Williams around  And decide to commit suicide  At his house  How do you shoot yourself  With a rifle  With a god damn shotgun  It's not that easy  I know they do it  But it's not that easy  Unbelievable  Who has arms that long  William Shatner though  Said his wife  Had battled with alcohol  And she drowned in the pool  Well that could be  You know 
[01:34:30]  Do you think  When he found her  If she was still  Flapping a little  He might not have  Just looked at his watch  For a few minutes  Until she stopped moving  I'm not saying maybe  I'm not saying he killed her  But I'm saying perhaps  If he saw some bubbles  Coming up from her mouth  Okay let me ask you a question  He didn't want to get himself  Quite that wet  In his Star Trek jammies  Is that murder  Is it  Is it  Is it  I don't know  Is it  I don't know  I think  I think it's probably  Negligence  It's probably 
[01:35:00]  One of those things  Montgomery Clifton  A Place in the Sun  Went to  Went to  The chair  At the end of that movie  For killing  Murdering  Shelley Witness  But actually  She fell out of the boat  Because they were arguing  And he  He never saved her  Mrs. Rosen  Mrs. Rosen  Oh  Mrs. Rosen  Ernest Borgnine  Remember that  When he saw her dead body  From Poseidon  Oh Poseidon  And she's laying there  They all loved her so much  I used to look like Marilyn  They loved her so much  Oh Mrs. Rosen  Mrs. Rosen  Mrs. Rosen  I can't climb up this street

No I'm not the real Cartman voice  Trey Parker is the one  That does the real Cartman voice  Oh oh  Can you say  Hey you guys  I'm going home  Hey you guys  I love  I live for that show 
[01:42:30]  It's all  It's so hilarious  Trey Parker  One of my favorite bits  Mario has done for our show  And we're not going to make you do it live  We'll play it as you leave  I don't remember it  No it's  It's Cartman getting high  Yeah  I love  Love that  Laurie have you ever heard that?  No I don't recall that specific episode  No no no  It's something  Mr. Hankey  Yeah it's something that Mario did for us  It's something that I did for them on the show  Right  We're going to play just for you Laurie  They're a little slow over the border  It's okay we got Toronto  It's Toronto 
[01:43:00]  A little flap head  Thank you  Thank you Laurie  Thank you Laurie  Laurie  Laurie  God I cannot get this horror view out of my face  Well you have to look at that thing  Bonnie Lee  Backley  You know my brother goes out with women like that  Really?  Not like that much beautiful  Bonnie Blake snitch  My brother went out with  I told you my brother went out with the Penthouse Pet of the Year  Yeah  Did I tell you that?  Your brother went out with  Penthouse Pet of the Year a few years back 
[01:43:30]  And she was like from the south  Did you talk like this?  And she like had big plump plump  And her mouth was like  Like big lips and big lips  Nice right?  Beautiful girl  But she was like  I had them over  I made chicken cutlets  She was like  Oh chicken cutlets  These are delicious  I love these  I've never heard of them before  You know what?  They're like chicken  Only flat  I was like  And your breasts are like boobs  Only fake  It was so ridiculous 
[01:44:00]  Oh my god  Look at me  We were looking at this during a commercial break  Somebody  Somebody sent us the link  And as we're looking  Mario looks at this shot here  Which we'll put these up on Foundry  You'll get a good look at them  But it's Bonnie Lee  Holding herself  She's laying on her back  Her knees are very very separated from each other  And she is holding stuff 
[01:44:30]  So far apart  That  I mean  Robert Blake was a small guy  And I'm surprised he didn't just fall  Right in  That's what it looks like  And it's very  Very discolored  As I look here  It's very  Wait a minute  It's like that  That one bad  Clam you get  Right  Right  You ever get a bad clam  In the whole bunch  And it's  I'm from Boston  I've had many bad clams  I love clams 
[01:45:00]  You know you get the dozen clams  But there's that one  With the old meat  Hanging off the side  Right  It's discolored  Right  Purple  You know what  Exactly  It's so bad  That it's making  I'm talking about clams  Yeah I know  Filet  Take a filet mignon  Right  It's a lovely filet mignon  Filet mignon  And that's what we're ready to do  Take a knife and butterflies  I think that's a good  The butterflies  The filet  Yes  And then  What are we going to do  Then throw it on a barbershop floor  And then what  And it looks just like Bonnie Lee 
[01:45:30]  But if you take that  And you mix it with some flour  Or cornstarch  And then perhaps some  Some gelatin  You can make a nice  Shaky mold  That you can  You can make some jello  Jello  Jello  You take that  Chop it up  Put it in the gelatin mold  And you can have a nice  Mold of that  Stuff  Whatever the hell  You know what Mario says to us though  We're looking at this picture  And we're all going  Ugh  Disgusting  It's  But it does  It is such a huge  She looks like she's wearing  Bikini underwear 
[01:46:00]  Yeah it's horrific  It is so  Well the picture's a little distorted  That it looks like  No  No  No  That's just no shame  No I'm talking there  It looks like she's got something else  No  No she's holding things  In a certain way  Where you leave nothing to the imagination  Yeah  Now we're looking at  Ugh  And Mario goes  More power to you guys  You know like we're the brave guys  That have to deal with that  I was like thanks for procreating guys  See you later  You know you can't base it on that  No you can't  There are very beautiful ones  And I suggested Mario  There's probably some ugly seas that you've looked at  Some ugly mules of gentlemen 
[01:46:30]  That you probably thought  Ugh  They're not all pretty  That is an ugly one  So you can't base it all on what you're seeing  On Bonnie Lee  No that's true  That actually looks like the gunshot wound  That Robert Blake probably gave her  You know what that song  You know what that whole thing represents to me  You know that picture  People that really love that picture look at it  What that  It's for the lonely  Who makes you feel around  That's what it's for  It looks like the face on Mars  Ah  Something 
[01:47:00]  Oh it looks like some hot dog or something  I don't know  Ah Maria  Maria  Or Marla  Marla  Maria  Hello  Yeah hello  Yes  What's your name there  Marla  What  What  Marla  What  Marla  Marla  Are you okay  Yes  Do you have a cold  No  My voice is just like this  You're not a man are you  You sound like  No  You sound like Ben snoring  No  What's the matter with you

[01:48:30]  Sound of the pleasure  Moment  Okay  All right  Let her rip  Okay  Let her rip  I'm  Take care  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm 
[01:49:00]  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  Help me get hurt.  Help me get hurt. 
[01:49:30]  Let me tell you, fine acting.  I thought she was indicating, playing for results.  She was speaking, but I couldn't understand what you were saying.  Yeah.  I heard it.  Hi, Marla.  Very good.  Very good, Marla. 
[01:50:00]  That's what I'm doing here in French.  No, we don't need to hear it in French.  You're done.  Thank you, Marla.  Good job.  There was something missing in there, though.  She didn't get to the peak.  Well, some girls are a little more quiet.  No, she didn't get to the peak.  If you've got to do it, you've got to get to the peak.  Otherwise, you're not pleasing the audience.  Although her phone's in like a real audio circa 1992.  Yeah.  You know?  Low bandwidth.  A real audio.  She missed one beat in the scene there.  Hey, Ben, what's going on?  Ben, what's up?  What's up, bro? 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, you guys still do the six o'clock queen for what?  We haven't done one in about a month.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe a fine lady will bring that back for us today.  Yeah, man.  That's the stuff there.  All right, Ben.  We'll try to make it happen today, okay?  All right, dude.  Calling from Maryland, man.  All right.  Thanks for the support down there.  We greatly appreciate it.  Yeah, dude.  Listen in on YSP.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  Bye.  Hey, man.  Is Rick out of his mind here?  Why, why?  Did we ever give Robert Blake the benefit of the doubt? 
[01:51:00]  Is that what he's saying?  Rick.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, ONA.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  What are you saying here?  No, I was just hearing briefly what you guys were saying about Robert Blake.  Just saying that I understand, you know, because she is a scumbag and all that stuff.  Yeah.  I was just saying, because sometimes, not that I support OJ anyway or anything.  I was just curious, Tony, you know, what you were saying about, you know, that you guys  were like, really trash OJ.  Okay, I got your point.  Don't get me wrong.  OJ's bitch deserved to die, too. 
[01:51:30]  You don't get the guy's car and drive it around and give guys hummers in OJ's house,  in the car.  Right.  The guy paid for it.  I mean, you hooked up with OJ.  You know the guy was a volatile man.  He had beaten you before.  And if you stick around in that situation, you're stupid.  And, you know, she was asking for something like that.  Right.  But, you know, guilty is sin, the OJ.  I'm not saying he's innocent.  Just like Robert Blake.  There you go.  Definitely. 
[01:52:00]  No, I just wanted to clear that up, guys.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I'm Ron Goldman, just a, you know, stupid bastard that decided to go along for the ride.  Hey, let's get married.  Pretty bad, right?  You know, I got things to do.  Okay.  Mario killed for us today.  I had a great time today.  And we had a lot of fun.  And he's doing the thing, man.  I'm doing two nights on Broadway.  May 19th and 20th, Roundabout Theater.  That's Sunday and Monday.  I'll be at the Sunday show.  Come, 212-719-1390.  I know this is a big deal for you, Tom.  It is a big deal.  So I'm going to go down and support you, Mario.  I'm so glad you're going to come. 
[01:52:30]  And he's going to kill.  So we highly recommend you go see Mario Sunday or Monday.  All right?  Yes.  All right.  So, Anthony?  Yes.  Opie?  Opie?  Yes.  Anthony?  Yes.  I love you more than words can say.  Can you just say like?  No.  I...  No.  You're not funny.  No.  You're not funny.  Oh, you said it before I did.  Yeah, you pissed me off.  You said it before I did.  I'm going to steal that one.  I'll accept lust.  Lust?  Lust, yeah.  Because you know what?  Let me tell you something.  Wow.  It would be an animalistic thing.  I'm an okay-looking guy.  It's not like I'm some fucking dog saying he's a good-looking guy. 
[01:53:00]  You know, it's a flattering thing.  It's like, you know, hey.  Let me tell you something.  I have plenty of straight guys like the attention.  If you're a good-looking gay man and you're complimenting the straight guys,  even if you're a fat gay man and you compliment the straight guy,  let me tell you something.  If the gay guys aren't liking you, you're in trouble.  Really?  Yeah.  Is that it?  Yeah, I think so.  So you should be thrilled if a gay guy finds you attractive?  Look, if they're coming on to you, you know, that's one thing.  But if a guy comes up to you and says, you know what? 
[01:53:30]  You're a really attractive guy.  You're a good-looking guy.  Boom, that's it.  Goodbye.  Wow.  How about that?  You're not going to, like, try kissing me or anything, right?  No, but you know what?  I don't even want to hear.  What?  What, Maria?  What?  I would never...  Hey, look at this time.  I'm out of here because I don't want to hear.  I don't want to hear those who know what.  I was not going to say anything.  Go ahead.  I was just going to say, there's a bubble all the way.  I'll make you feel all right.  Mario, it's always a pleasure.  You're going to be on The View tomorrow morning?  I'll be on The View tomorrow morning.  So check it out on Mario on TV.  All right.  Goodbye.  I'm going to leave...  Well, Mario's leaving as we play one of my favorite things he's done for our radio show. 
[01:54:00]  Yes.  Because I can't do it live.  Cartman smoking weed.  Sweet.  And Anthony, I swear, no one's going to believe us when we come back.  Teen nude slumber party.  That's right.  Enjoy it.  That sounds like smoking pot.  You guys, I am so relaxed right now. 
[01:54:30]  Can I get a cookie, please, man?  Man, can I get a cookie?  I want a student party.  Man, can I get some pancakes and some food?  Oh, sweet.  Everything looks so carnivore.  Look, you guys.  Pass your eating potatoes.  I'm so happy.  I feel like I'm floating. 
[01:55:00]  The current it boys of FM talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.  Show your hairy pork chop.  My mother smokes crack rocks.  I'm for drunk teens.  What are you kidding?  How about I lay down and give you a little bukkake?  We laugh.  We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Game porn.  Bow.  Hey, could you soap up your bad place? 
[01:55:30]  The bloodier the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Cake.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Distance.  These guys performed this song on our show once, man.  Yeah.  Love the cake.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:56:00]  Write that stupid number down so we don't have to give it out all the time.  Yeah.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City.  Write it down.  You're going to need it sometime.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Have you seen a website that we're on?  It's Iamannoying.com.  It lists the reasons why celebrities are annoying. 
[01:56:30]  And we're on this list.  And what does it say?  And they also list why they might not be annoying.  Oh, oh, oh.  Um, Opie and Anthony, why they might be annoying.  They were fired in Boston after they pulled April Fool's prank, saying the mayor of Boston died.  That's annoying.  Can I interrupt you, Ant?  Yes.  My sister's going to kill you.  No, she's not.  Uh-oh.  My brother-in-law's been hanging with us today, and that's like his 12th Sam Adams. 
[01:57:00]  This is my 10th, maybe.  10th, maybe.  Not 12th.  He's hammered.  Come on.  He was still able to play foosball during break.  And a very good foosball player.  Thank you.  And so are yourself.  Thank you.  I wasn't sure.  When I heard all the talk on the radio, I wasn't sure.  But now playing with you, you're very good.  I don't like bragging about many things.  You know, but as far as foosball goes, that's, you know, pretty much nice.  So when you came in and said you play foosball, I was really looking forward to a good game,  and that's exactly what I got.  Yeah, that's pretty good. 
[01:57:30]  Yep.  Look at Fish.  Come on.  Come on.  This is one of the star softball players, too.  We had to get him on the air for two minutes to make it official that he could play in a  celebrity softball game.  Because he was pretty much a co-MVP with my brother last time he played.  All right, all right, Fish.  We'll introduce you as my drunken brother-in-law.  Very good.  My sister's going to have your...  All right.  Let's see if some of these things are true.  Well, that I don't think is an annoying thing.  Can you start over, Ryan? 
[01:58:00]  I apologize.  It's why they might be annoying.  This is Iamannoying.com, and there's celebrities that they list as if they're annoying.  They were fired in Boston after the April Fool's prank.  I don't know if that's annoying.  They were hosts of a short-lived XFL pregame show.  Oh, man.  All right.  That was pretty annoying.  Why was it annoying, though?  I don't know.  It just wasn't the proper vehicle for you and I and our talents.  They laugh too much at their own jokes.  Well, I just laughed at one.  All right. 
[01:58:30]  That might be annoying to people if we do that.  They do not come up with many of their own ideas.  Oh, that is bad.  No, see, that's wrong.  That's not good.  They are obsessed with insulting their old station in Boston.  All right.  Well, we are obsessed with insulting them.  We haven't insulted them in a while.  Yeah.  All right.  They don't like the fact that we've been syndicated.  That's annoying to them.  But that syndication brought us, like, Drunken Tom from New Orleans. 
[01:59:00]  They love to reuse certain words and sound effects repeatedly.  We've backed off on that a little bit.  Don't say ding to that.  No.  Anthony never attended college.  That's why you're annoying?  That's annoying?  Opie has a very short fuse.  I've been under control lately.  Anthony has been divorced.  That's annoying?  That's annoying?  This is the dumbest sight ever.  Why is it annoying?  Because you're divorced. 
[01:59:30]  They took over the number one slot held by Don and Mike,  and within a few months, they were in 17th place.  Well, that's true.  It's not annoying, though.  But now we're maybe to some people.  Now we're number one, men, 18 to 49.  Right.  In the D.C. area.  Thank you for the support.  And then they say why they might not be annoying.  All right.  Let's hear some of these.  They've become very popular in New York without any promotion.  All right.  I'll give them that.  They are on a station that has low ratings outside of their show. 
[02:00:00]  They've become so popular within three years of New York debut  that they've signed a lucrative syndication deal.  All right.  They quickly became popular in Philly, Cleveland, Buffalo, Boston.  These aren't really annoying, not annoying things, though.  Our listeners could come up with a better list of why we're annoying.  I know.  But they have a bunch of things.  And then they have links to people that have been on our show,  which I just clicked on Jay Moore,  and I can't get to it because I guess people are slamming the site. 
[02:00:30]  But I'd love to see what they say about that.  Andrew Dice Clay, Jim Brewer is in there.  And I guess you're going to have to go there yourself and read it.  All right.  I am annoying dot com.  Eric, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I got my reason why you guys are annoying.  Yeah.  Because you spend entire days teasing bits.  Get to the slumber party already.  All right.  People get so upset.  Add that to the list, okay?  Yeah, that I'll give them.  Can we get Stephen Lynch in here, at least?  Where's Stephen?  Lynch, hey! 
[02:01:00]  What's up, Stephen?  What's up?  How you doing, man?  Look at Lynch.  You know, Lynch, I heard you played a good cover song today,  that Jay Moore, Mike DiNicola song.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Full-blown AIDS.  Full-blown AIDS.  We started the show with FBA, yeah.  We love that thing.  Are you backing away from that now?  No.  You're backing away from the classics.  Some of the classics.  No.  That's my favorite song.  No, I have a career.  I think this isn't the Total Truth Tuesday.  I have a career.  Total Truth Tuesday. 
[02:01:30]  I'd have to admit how much I hate that damn song.  Hey, um.  No, it's fine.  You know, whatever.  It's not yours.  It's not mine.  Anthony, the teen slumber party thing is going to have to wait just a couple more minutes,  and I'll tell you why.  But it's going to be worth it, and I'll tell you why.  We were talking about the whole pre-scandal thing, right?  Yeah.  And we said the next time Lynch comes in, he's got to tell the story about how his parents  got together.  Oh, yeah.  Because we haven't...  Can you talk about that still?  Or is that in the FBA category of things that...  No? 
[02:02:00]  That's cool.  The Pope forbade me to talk about it.  Because this is...  I got those sealed envelopes with a wax stamp on it.  This is really a great story.  The Vatican.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't remember how much of the story you know, but my dad was a Roman Catholic priest.  Real-life priest, collar-wearing.  Oh, yeah.  Until he was 38 or 39.  38, 39.  What year is this?  My mammy was a...  Mammy.  My mammy watched Floa.  Mammy.  She was a nun.  Yeah.  A real-life...  A real-life...  Habit-wearing...  Flying nun. 
[02:02:30]  Not flying.  Not flying variety.  She was restricted to the ground most of the time.  Was she a hot nun?  I've never seen pictures of her.  You've never seen pictures of her?  And I probably wouldn't be able to form an opinion anyway.  Yeah.  You've never seen a picture of her in the penguin suit there?  No.  I never have, actually.  Really?  Yeah.  And where was this going on?  Back in Michigan.  In Michigan.  Yeah.  They were teachers.  Teachers in Michigan.  Catholic school, obviously.  Just two young religious people.  I see where you're going with this, man. 
[02:03:00]  Fighting those urges.  I know.  Fighting those urges.  Fighting those urges for a long time.  And for a long time, they were fighting us.  Yeah.  My dad was...  What's this, Enigma?  Oh, you know what?  The damn thing's skipping on me.  Of course it is.  I had it all nice for you.  Do you think I'm sexy?  So they...  Do you think I'm sexy?  Well, listen.  It's a good version.  Yeah.  Nothing works around here.  Nothing works.  I hate this place.  Today, Anthony.  Today, Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  CD 3, jammed.  All right.  Not A or B.  Not A or B today.  Just yell at the CD player.  Power of Christ compels you!  It's the story of Lynch's parents.  I don't even have to tell the story.  The song kind of tells it all.  We'll let you know the question. 
[02:04:00]  The ultimate taboo.  The ultimate taboo.  His lips are dry, but our heart is checking out.  All right.  This is gross, man.  It's like creeping out.  I'm thinking about my parents.  What's threatening?  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  The power of Christ compels you!  Let the power of Christ compels you.  If you really need it, just reach out to me and come on. 
[02:04:30]  Do I make you?  I trust you all and clean spirits in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
[02:05:00]  It is he who commands you, he who blund you, and shall have a limit of his death in hell.  Give to God from this creature of God.  The courtship.  That sounds a little intense.  Now we're having fun.  God the Father commands you.  God the Son commands you. 
[02:05:30]  God the Holy Son of it commands you.  The Holy Son of the cross commands you.  The blood of the martyrs commands you.  Wow, that was intense.  That's amazing.  That's exactly the way my dad tells that story.  Is that the conception?  That was their first date.  All right, back to Lynch.  So there they are in Michigan.  Priest and a nun.  Young, hot priest, young, hot nun. 
[02:06:00]  Well, so fantasy porno, isn't it, Opie?  They enter the world of the Roman Catholic religion, right?  Giving up their life.  Don't play porno music.  Oh, this is the music to when the priest comes in and the nun is there, right?  Yeah.  All right, sorry. 
[02:06:30]  I couldn't make a habit of this.  Go ahead, Lynch.  Hey, what are you doing here?  Anyone else have to feel this story is going to take a half hour?  I don't know what to say, you know.  Well, I'll just say, okay, so they're working together?  No, they weren't working together.  They had mutual friends.  Other priests and nuns?  Yes.  Who also met and decided to fix them up?  They got married.  My dad was the priest marrying the couple, and my mom was a guest at the wedding.  You understand?  Now, how could they be getting married if they were priests? 
[02:07:00]  Well, they did essentially the same thing my parents did.  Somehow they met and decided to disobey the...  Yeah, it happened a lot back in the late 60s, early 70s, so...  Did it groovy.  It was far out, man.  It was all that acid directory.  It was the cool priest.  So, did they...  A little Spanish fly in the...  The priest and nun that your father had married...  Right. 
[02:07:30]  ...as a priest...  Right.  Were they already heave-hoed out of the...  I don't know.  I don't know their story.  Because it doesn't seem like...  Theirs is a different story.  It doesn't seem like you could get married first, and then get kicked out.  Well, that's what my parents did.  They did?  They did it in defiance of Ken-in-law.  Wow.  Yeah.  So they got married?  Yeah.  They secretly got married?  No, they weren't secret about it.  How?  Did they wear their traditional stuff at the wedding?  I think at that point, they weren't wearing that stuff anyway.  Really?  Yeah, they were the...  They quit first, and then they got married. 
[02:08:00]  Well, they didn't quit.  They were, you know...  I guess priests could wear layman's clothing.  Especially back then, in those groovy days.  Yeah, in those groovy days, you know, when everybody was kind of radical.  Isn't that a great story, though?  Yeah.  That's a little wild.  And then the church turned...  They were excommunicated?  Yeah, they were excommunicated.  Excommunicated.  Excommunicated.  And they love what's going on, by the way.  Oh, I bet.  Not the pedophilia, but the fact that it's all coming out into the open there, like, see?  It's like, hey, you thought we were weird.  Yeah.  You know, getting that... 
[02:08:30]  A man and woman falling in love is weird.  Right.  Maybe priests marrying women is not such a bad idea.  Well, at least we weren't two knuckles deep in Junior.  You know?  Absolutely.  Now, that's weird.  Just my mom.  You know, you have to take it too far, Stephen.  Well, that's not where we were going.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to...  You're right.  Flaming Arrow from Staten Island.  I assume they used the missionary position.  Oh, hey.  Blackie. 
[02:09:00]  So.  All right.  Hmm.  That is some...  They didn't really like that, my priest song, when I first wrote it.  No?  No, because they were concerned that I was making fun of the issue of pedophilia.  And now...  That's Eddie the Not Murderer.  Yeah.  Ah.  Yeah.  His little laugh.  Now I think they like the song.  They thought you...  Yeah, well, it's very, you know, it's very topical now.  It's very timely, yeah.  You know, you wrote that how long ago? 
[02:09:30]  Six years ago.  See?  And I think if people had only listened to me...  If people...  None of this would have happened.  Didn't you write...  This is trying to save some kids.  Didn't you write full-blown AIDS in 72?  You should have seen that coming, too.  Exactly.  Right?  I know it.  I was on a trip to Africa, and I saw some goings-on.  I saw some...  Saw some guides.  I went, I'm no scientist, but railing a monkey.  There's going to be an outbreak of some sort in about 11 years.  Hey, man, Dingo, stop tooling that chimp.  So I called my ghostwriters, Mikey Nicola and Jay Moore. 
[02:10:00]  Of course.  And they wrote the song.  Yeah.  All right, and nude teen slumber party, please.  Ah, you know something?  I don't know why you're delaying this.  Me?  What?  No, I'm not praising you.  Stop it, Rick.  This is so hot.  Teen daughter wants to attend Friends' nude slumber party.  That's the headline in Ann Landers' column.  Dear Ann Landers, I hope you can help me with an unusual problem.  My teenage daughter was recently invited to a nude slumber party. 
[02:10:30]  She assured me there would be no boys there.  I called the mother of the girl and talked to her about this party.  While the mother admitted the idea was strange, she said that she would be present during the party to supervise.  She also said her husband and teenage son would be away for the weekend so there would be no males present in the house.  I've got to say right now, if I'm the kid in this house, that thing would be wired up like a cell block at prison with cameras.  I would have every type of camera possible hidden in every device taping this. 
[02:11:00]  Nude teen slumber party.  She assured me that the nude slumber parties are all the rage these days.  Anybody?  Aren't they?  Have you heard of nude slumber parties?  We're in 21 cities.  We will not get one person admitting to this.  If any parent out there has heard of their kid coming up to them and suggesting this nude slumber party, 
[02:11:30]  the mother says, I've never heard of such a thing.  And cannot imagine why.  Hold on to your hats now, people.  And cannot imagine why a bunch of 15 and 16-year-old girls would want to spend 12 hours together stark naked.  Do I have to repeat that?  Yeah.  Did you all get it?  No, I didn't.  I cannot imagine why a bunch of 15 and 16-year-old girls would want to spend 12 hours together stark naked. 
[02:12:00]  Baffled mom in Burlingame, California.  Now, I've been reading Ann Landers off and on for many years.  And I thought, you know, she was going to say, no, don't, don't do this.  You skipped over to the answer.  And you gasped.  Doesn't this sound like not an Ann Landers answer?  I think Ann was on the crack that day.  Dear mom, I'm as baffled as you are. 
[02:12:30]  While walking around nude may be an interesting experiment, and sleeping nude has long been popular, I cannot imagine the appeal of doing either with a bunch of other girls in close quarters.  Now, here's the kicker.  As long as you trust the mother of these girls to supervise for the duration of the party, I see no harm in it.  She's condoning teen nude slumber party.  Condoning it.  Meanwhile, ask your daughter why she finds this such an attractive idea. 
[02:13:00]  You might learn something.  Ann is for this.  I didn't think she was for any type of teen nudity.  This would lead to experimentation with each other, perhaps.  Perhaps an opening of sexuality and bisexuality.  Ann's a closet dike.  Could be.  This idea made her a little hot.  Or she's very senile.  Yeah, maybe she just lost her effing mind, because I'll tell you something. 
[02:13:30]  Is she still answering these letters?  Probably not.  They got a lot of ghostwriters.  They just have the Ann Landers, like, isn't Dear Abby her granddaughter or something now?  Is Dear Abby?  No, Dear Abby now gets the letters answered.  When you mail them into Dear Abby, it's her daughter.  Oh, okay.  Who looks just like her.  The big beehive hairdo from the 50s holdover.  Yeah.  George.  Anthony, George wanted you to read that a little slower.  Really?  Yes.  Fabio, what's up?  Hey, guys. 
[02:14:00]  I wanted to ask Ann if Ann Landers is related to George Glass.  George Glass.  Mother, I want to have a nude sleepover party.  Oh, Jan, I guess that's okay.  The boys and Dad will be gone for a while.  And not like Dad would mind anyway.  He's a flaming faggot.  But you know what that leads to?  Come on, picture it.  Oh, yeah, picture it.  15, 16-year-old girls completely naked hanging out with each other. 
[02:14:30]  You know, a whole gaggle of them.  In a room?  What do you think's going on there?  There's touching, Opie.  Touching.  Know what it leads to?  Experimentation.  Looking.  And what?  It leads to this.  Hot soup.  That's what I say.  Hot soup.  Hot soup.  Exactly.  Hot soup, guys.  Because you know what happens?  Girls are very free like that.  And open.  And they start touching.  Comparing.  Please tell me more.  Pairing each other.  They're little buds.  Little nubs.  No, by that age, it ain't nubs no more. 
[02:15:00]  Come on.  Those are some well-developed chippies at that age, right?  These days, especially like right around that age, they're always like, you know, if they're bi, they're like hip.  You know what I'm saying?  Uh-huh.  It's like, it's really.  It's the in thing to do.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I always thought they did it to get boys' attention, though.  You know, they make out with their little girlfriends.  Yeah, that's my attention.  Of course it does, doesn't it?  They're just sitting there. 
[02:15:30]  Because it's kind of, you know, sexy enough when they're in their PJs having a pillow fight, right?  Right.  Remember Dawn?  My sister Dawn used to have like little slumber parties and sleepover parties.  And I would make the girls do things, headstands, for my enjoyment.  I remember this.  I remember this girl.  Her name was, it was one of the girls in East Islip.  The old redhead?  The Kelly girl.  Oh, no.  That little Kelly girl.  Miller.  No, it was the Kelly girl.  She was doing, we had her all, they were all in little nightgowns, right? 
[02:16:00]  And we had, I had them do headstands because their nightgowns would flip right up over their heads.  And I'd be looking going, this is great.  We're having a contest.  Yes, how long you could do a headstand for.  And I'm just, I'm just standing there timing them.  Keep going.  Don't back out now.  And Dawn would get up and go, it's my turn.  We're like, no, no, no.  No, no.  You sit.  You're a judge.  You're judging for how well they do it.  We'll time it.  You go make the lemonade. 
[02:16:30]  And one girl did a headstand.  Brother's busy.  And she was wearing these big bloomers.  She was wearing these big bloomers.  And they pulled away at the leg.  And I saw the gold mine.  At that early age, I knew that was my quest for the rest of my life.  I found like, it was like when they got the message, the divine message to search for the Holy Grail.  I looked and said, this is my mission in life.  Well, the phones have exploded. 
[02:17:00]  We'll go to the phones next, Ant.  Wrong.  And Stephen Lynch is here.  We'll play some Stephen Lynch songs when we get back as well.  Absolutely.  Lynch, where are you playing?  Get a plug in.  I'm playing tonight at Gotham and tomorrow at Center Stage in New Rochelle.  Nice.  More with Stephen Lynch.  And we'll go to the phones over this new teen slumber party.  Right.

Oh, yeah, my pleasure  Very nice  I figure you guys play my songs enough on this station  I might as well give you a plug where I can  A frequent guest on the O.P. and Anthony show  I hear they edited my performance, though  I didn't see it, but I heard they cut out a few things  Oh, the reviews were great  People were calling us like crazy, yeah  And don't think that we play the songs, you know  I'm sure it works well for you, but it's not for you 
[02:19:30]  It's a few less minutes we have to come up with anything  It's the FU Liner, it's one of my songs  I understand  We got things that we do, it's called filler  You know?  You gotta defend yourself to the bosses talking about the teen slumber party  I know, the teen slumber party  We're reading Ann Landers' columns and getting in trouble for it  Why do you think we went with that stupid Eddie phone call?  Yeah  We didn't have anything planned  I'm like, ah, this will kill two days  It worked up  Maybe a guy will fess up to murder today 
[02:20:00]  Maybe we'll get lucky  We sit back, instead of doing show prep  We go, I hope some guy comes and fesses up to murdering two people  Because we have nothing  I did say that to Anthony  That day, I go, we're in the back office  I go, wait, man, I'm not feeling good about today  I don't think we have a lot of stuff for the show  He goes, ah, these are usually the best days  So these are the best ones  So we come in and we're like, you know  We're making believe we're having a killer show  And next thing you know  Next thing you know, this guy, you know, says what he said  And we're off to the races for two days 
[02:20:30]  Yeah  Two days  Thank you  Thank you, Eddie  Giddy up  Great times  I did a few rapes in college, if that'll help  Want to fess up to those, maybe?  Yeah  Were roofies involved?  No, no, roofies, come on  That's the pussy way out  Pure overpowering  Oh, yes  Pure overpowering  This is what you get when you mix a priest and a nun, eh?  That's the real  The devil's child  The real way to do it  Hey, I'm kidding  Where's Ken to yell about that?  I'm kidding, there were roofies involved 
[02:21:00]  Pete saw you at a college  Pete?  Yo, what's up, guys?  You got a story about Stephen Lynch?  Yo, Lynch, you, man  You absolutely screwed us forever at Molloy College  I don't know if you remember the show  It was you, Italian, and Louis Black  Yeah  That's a great lineup  Do you remember the little, uh  Well, do you remember the little, uh  Charade you played with the nun puppet?  Yeah  What?  That wasn't a very smart thing to do at a Catholic college  Oh, come on  Oh, boy 
[02:21:30]  What's the story?  Somebody gave me one of those boxing nuns  Oh, yeah  With a, yeah, yeah  Push a little thing  I did this little thing where it, you know  Snakes its way down my body  And uses its hand  And it looks like it's, you know  Crankin'  Crankin' me  Nice  No, but he's the kicker  Like, they, first of all  They screwed everybody  Like, we can never have, like, a comedian again  Oh, come on  Yeah, you can  No, I swear to God  We had dollar beers  But here's the absolute worst part  Then we didn't fall for it  Yeah  See, you're supposed to wait for us to say, well, what? 
[02:22:00]  What?  Yeah, the guy just  Oh, then you hang up  Like, if you're just telling a story and hang up  It's like ridiculous  Yeah, so then I, um  I went to McDonald's  We were driving out of the drive-thru click  I got him  We were just waiting for the next line  If you would have even said something like  And then you know what happened?  What?  Click  Good  Very good  Dude, you were a tool  You totally bastardized the meaning of getting somebody  You stink 
[02:22:30]  You suck  You have nothing  Brett, what's going on?  Uh, my 14-year-old daughter went to one of them slumber parties  Are you insane?  You know what?  Hold on  Your mother called us up and said that  That everything is fine  You know, we let her go  Everything was fine  And so a couple weeks later  We find out that my daughter  And three of the other girls  Have naked pictures going around on the internet  Of course they do  They take their little pictures with the cameras  Wait, wait, you know what? 
[02:23:00]  No, it's the brother with the hidden cameras  No, no  It was one of the other girls at the party  The girls would do that  Brett, are you pulling our leg?  No  This really went on  Your daughter went to one of these new teen slumber parties  Yeah, my son came home to me a couple weeks later  And said, you know  There's a naked picture of her  Oh my God  I gotta ask you  Yeah, why were you  It was kind of sick  Did you look?  No  Well, actually  We had taken the girl's parents to court  Yeah  And those pictures had to come out in court 
[02:23:30]  Wow  See?  Why would you let your daughter go to a nude slumber party?  Because Ann Landers says it's okay  Yeah, because Ann Landers says it's okay  How about the fact that, yes  There won't be a guy there  As the woman has said in this Ann Landers article  Having a  15 and 16 year old girls  Having a nude slumber party  The mother says that there's going to be no boys there  Her husband and son are going away  On a vacation that weekend  It's going to be completely supervised  And Ann Landers says 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, why not have a nude teenage girl slumber party?  They can't  Make sure there's no cameras  See, this is how  Archaic Ann Landers is  She doesn't understand in the digital age  You could have a camera  The size of a credit card  And snap out about  $500,000 worth of kiddie porn  In one of these parties  Are you acting like you're outraged?  I am so goddamn outraged  Ken Stevens, our general manager  Do you hear our outrage right now?  Do you hear the outrage now? 
[02:24:30]  Meanwhile, he's fashioning a pen-sized camera  And a teddy bear's eye  Yes  The mother's name?  Paula Poundstone  Yeah, exactly  Why would anybody let their kid go?  How does the parent pitch this?  You open up your little envelope  Oh, you got an invitation  It's your first one  We're having a party  A naked party  You're cordially invited  Do you want square envelopes  Or vulva-shaped envelopes? 
[02:25:00]  Open up  There's a party inside  Little short pubes fall out of the envelope  When you open it  Like those little sparkles and stuff  Well, don't say it  Oh, I'm sorry  I know, awful stuff  Actually, there's all kinds of  Horrid, horrific stuff on the internet  We all know that  All right  Let's get back to Steven  Someone wanted to hear the  Could someone set up a live internet feed  At the party? 
[02:25:30]  No, that's not happening either  Jackasses  Enough  We're going to get in trouble  Because Ken Stevens gets titillated at this stuff  And he comes in and yells at us  Hey, what's the deal with the softball game?  Are we...  Oh, I'm a great way to get off this subject  Team softball  I mean, celebrity softball  Just about sold out  This is going to be close to 8,000 people there  Just about sold out  I think they have standing room tickets left  Great  It's sponsored by Coors Light 
[02:26:00]  Lynchie  We're going to have the draft either tomorrow or Monday  I just need to ask you one question  Yeah  How long will you stay sober?  I might need you in the early innings  Well, I can give you four solid innings before I...  Because you were pretty solid last year  But then you start falling apart later  No, I didn't  What are you talking about?  Unlimited supply of Coors Light  I didn't even drink last year  I'm just messing with you  I'm going to quote him  What?  Steven earlier said  Yeah, that'll be really cool 
[02:26:30]  Coming down to Mulcahy's afterwards  After a day of drinking and getting ripped  See, there's unlimited supply of Coors Light in the dugout  Joe, are you trying to work in some plug?  No, I said nothing  That was pretty much a plug  That was a plug  But then people are going to assume  Because now everyone out there is like  Well, what's going on in Mulcahy's after the softball game?  Wow  Oh, you brought it up  That was probably...  That was a half-assed whore move  A whore would have committed and gone for the whole plug  No, it was just too long  Of course, Mulcahy's after the softball game 
[02:27:00]  Which is June 1st, of course  Mulcahy's Evolution is playing...  Look, Hugo's here, by the way  Lead singer of Evolution  I was the biggest journey...  Well, I still am a huge journey fan  You know how I know this, Steven?  I know this because every time that we go out to a gig  And maybe we all get up on stage and start singing  We degenerate into starting to play journey tunes at about 2 in the morning  Drunk off our asses  Thinking how great our harmonies sound  I can do love and touch and squeeze it 
[02:27:30]  Dude, I'll do the two harmonies that are here  You do the other three  We could do them, two of us, five-part harmonies  I'm going to sing from my balloon knot  Give me a mic  We've done some really good harmonies every other Tuesday night  Dude, do you understand how drunk we are when we're doing harmonies?  Alright, you know what?  Someone's got to tape it now  Yeah  I'll challenge you guys  You say you sound good?  Sure do  The harmonies all out  That late in the night?  Roll tape, my friend, and you bring it in if you have balls 
[02:28:00]  We do  If we got a bar nine on Tuesday  I've seen you guys  The first five sets are brilliant  Five sets?  These guys play like nine sets at one gig  Give me sets six, seven, and eight  And we'll have a hell of a radio show  When you look out the front window of the place  And the sky is that deep blue and birds are tweeting  We're like, wow, this has been a long set  Something's wrong with my voice  I can't hit them high notes anymore  Hey, this is great  Have a good night, everybody  I think I streamed my voice on that last song 
[02:28:30]  Come on, knock it on heaven's door one more time  Joe, you bring a tape  We'll have a show for the ages  I'll tape it  That's true  We should do that  Because at the end of the night  It's a hell of a lot of fun  And no one notices  Because the whole  Everyone's tanked  What's worse than not hitting the notes  Is the slurring that goes on  The slurring that goes on  Na, na, na, na, na, na  The lights goes on  The city  Want to be there 
[02:29:00]  The city  Whoa, whoa  Whoa, whoa  You've got to bring it to the table  Yeah, we should do that  Please do that  We could go on  But these guys  Just give them the first set  Tell them it's the last set  These guys do Journey  Like, unbelievable  I heard  I am  You go, of course  A front man  Unbelievable  A singer  And the look itself  Is the Steve Perry experience  You're killing me, dude  It's still the way it is  Where's the website  So they can go and check out a picture 
[02:29:30]  Double-double-double-almostjourney.com  Almostjourney.com  Check it out  It really is  It's Journey without the millions, man  There you go  That's exactly what it is  Sounds great  Looks great  And they'll be at Mulcahy's  Right after the softball game  Can we get back  We've got to talk about the softball  Yes, we do  Indeed  Blind Dave wants to play  I mean, is there  Stop it  We don't have beeping softball  What a ridiculous sport that is  Blind Dave  There's no way you could be blind  And catch a ball coming at you  That's beeping  If you could do that  No, you can't 
[02:30:00]  I can  We've got to get blind, Dave  At least at bat  And then just have the whole crowd yell swing  Swing!  Oh, thousands of people yell  All right, you're in  You're in  All right  And we should make some side bet with you, man  Because I'll come down to Connecticut  Because I have friends and family  Where I can live  Well, he don't know the difference  Yeah, that's true  What does he know from Connecticut and Jersey?  I like the mountains in Connecticut  The big Rockies  Come on, now  I used to drive trucks 
[02:30:30]  Dave, you won't be the drunkest guy there either  Dave, you're in Boston?  Yeah  I'm up in  I'm actually way past Boston  Yeah, they just drive him around the neighborhood for an hour  A couple hours and tell him he's in California  Put a sun lamp on him  What matter if I'm sober for the game?  I can tell you  I'll be sober  I'll stay away from the beers  Well, it's not the beers that do it  It's that Jack Daniels you slipped down  I haven't touched it  Haven't touched it like since your last show  Since we bruised your spleen, your kidney and broke three of your ribs? 
[02:31:00]  No, since the time I was there after that  See, people don't believe us  But he did a blind boxing with us  Got his ass  And I had a horrible hospital bill  And had back surgery  And your spleen was  What happened to your spleen?  You know why? Because I chose to do it  What happened to your spleen in that altercation?  I had to have a CAT scan  My spleen and my kidney were bruised 
[02:31:30]  It's not even a CAT scan  They put him near a Carvel ice cream machine  And tell him he's getting one  Just makes a noise  Oh yeah, we're looking at your innards  Yeah, just pay the bill  Sign the check  No, I've been in a couple of them last year  How do you know?  What did you look at?  No, but I would guarantee you  If I have someone near my ear  That could tell me  Near your ear?  You know what I mean  Alright  I just want him to swing  So I can go  Good eye, good eye  Aww  What? 
[02:32:00]  If someone tells me  Now  When the guy throws the ball  I will hit it  We'll have close to 8,000 people saying that  Well, that'll be  From the time it leaves the guy's hand  Until it's in the catch  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no  Aww  No, because like  The egg catcher thing  No  Everyone yelled at the  You know, all different times  If I just have someone  Standing next to me  And says  Now  You think so  No way  There is no way  It was the egg, didn't I?  Where's the egg shooting clip? 
[02:32:30]  Huh?  We just got to get past  The first two seconds  That's the part the  The nerd down the hall  Has a problem with  Oh, really? We can't replay that either?  No, but we set it up in a way that totally gives it away.  Oh, we did?  Yeah, because that was our stupid years.  We pretty much say, well, we say something that they'll dump out of you.  Well, this woman is actually firing an egg.  That's all you've got to say.  No one else elaborate.  That's all you've got to say.  But I guess we got a little too detailed.  But we had Blind Dave catching him in a basket. 
[02:33:00]  That was after we did some batting practice.  Yeah.  We were smashing raw eggs all over the place.  After Opie was throwing paper balls at me.  Well, yeah.  All right, Dave, we're going to have to prove he was blind.  So he's sitting here, and he's just talking into the mic,  and he's just kind of staring off into a space.  Because we didn't believe him.  In that Jose Feliciano kind of way.  And we rolled up a paper ball and threw it right at his face, 
[02:33:30]  and he didn't flinch until it hit him.  And Opie goes, okay, you're blind.  Like he passed the Opie blind test.  On Anthony from the other day, I'm not completely blind.  I see light and shadows.  And I catch little glimpses of things.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Well, how about that?  Congrats.  Whoopie doopie for me.  No, but I would love to play and smack the ball if I got someone to run for me.  All right, Dave, hold on.  All right.  We've got to get him involved in the game. 
[02:34:00]  Tom from New Orleans.  What's up?  How you guys doing?  What's up, Tom?  Here's his catchphrase.  Hey, Tommy.  What's going on, man?  I'm ready for the softball game.  Yeah, Tommy got fired.  Tom, what you doing now that you ain't working at our station in New Orleans?  I'm hoping I'm starting a new station, Radio for the Deaf.  Very funny.  Do you still listen to the old station?  Absolutely, man.  Cool.  Look, dude, when's the draft?  I don't know if you're playing.  I think you're just throwing out the first place. 
[02:34:30]  Why?  I'm good.  I'm telling you.  If I come all the way up there, I want to play.  No, it's great.  I can play.  I can bring a cooler to first base.  No, it's great, too.  You get to meet Frenchie for the first time face to face.  Oh.  I'm going to whip his French ass.  You know what, Ant?  I think they should meet for the first time on the pitcher's mound in front of 8,000 people.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  Make sure these two are separated until we introduce both of them.  Tom, what are you doing with yourself?  Come on.  I'm talking to you guys.  No, you know what I mean.  What are you doing as far as the job goes? 
[02:35:00]  We care.  Radio for the Deaf.  Stop it.  That joke didn't work the first time.  Come on.  What are you doing?  You should never repeat a joke if it didn't work the first time.  Are you sitting out for a little bit?  You okay financially?  Yeah, I'm fine.  Send you a few bucks?  I'm fine.  Why?  Are you going to give me a couple?  No.  Beer money.  Lynch will.  I'll give you a little beer money.  I'm ready, man.  All the cores you can drink?  Ooh, I'm there.  All right.  Cool.  I'm there.  All right, Tom.  You have nothing today.  But look.  No, no, no.  I don't have anything, but I'm telling you. 
[02:35:30]  Can we play a Steven Lynch song?  He is looking at that phone right now going, you mother effer.  They did it again to me.  I can't believe I look like a buffoon again.  All right.

People have been requesting Superhero from Stephen Lynch.  And pick one. 
[02:36:30]  Here you go.  Do I have the whole catalog?  Most of them.  Let me say.  The box set.  God, you've done 24 songs on our show.  And there's probably even more than that.  That's not even the updated one, right?  Yeah.  I've got a new album coming out pretty soon, by the way.  Stop it.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  It's an all-live album of all new material.  Well, all new meaning not on my last album, but give me a couple months and I'll come in  and tell you about it.  Rock.  Just mixed it yesterday, but it's good.  Good.  Several chants.  Some O&A references on it.  You'll enjoy it.  Oh! 
[02:37:00]  Nice!  You know, you're in an audience full of people and rascals in New Jersey.  You're going to get some people going, O&A!  You know.  Now, leave it on the record.  How about I like Down at the Old Pub?  That's a good one.  We play it a lot, though.  Do we?  Yeah.  Let's give them a taste of something else.  How about the duet that I sang with Tyke last time I was here?  Remember that one?  We play that one a lot.  We have a C-blocking song.  Oh, yeah.  You play that one too much?  That's a good one.  No, that is a pretty good one.  Do you want to go old school?  Let's go old school. 
[02:37:30]  Old school?  Oh, look.  Need to edit.  We can't play.  A lot of the old ones we can't play anymore.  Let me see.  I've got to give you new versions of those or something.  Let me see.  I know.  Edited versions.  How about, hmm, did FBA?  I don't really like any of these.  Just play FBA again.  I'm so kidding.  Hold on.  Look at Haywood from Yonkers' bowling song.  We play Thanks, Mom.  That's hilarious. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we play the C-blocker one, then?  I'm just trying to find one we haven't played.  It's a newer one, so I figured you haven't played it as much, probably.  Is this it, Rick?  All right.  It's the C-block song from Stephen Lynch and his friend Tyke.  Yeah.  Who's in that freaking commercial.  I was dying.  The Latrell Sprewell commercial?  I was like, how the hell did he get that?  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I haven't seen it.  He's acting like a crazy director.  Wait a minute.  That is him?  Yeah.  I said, that guy looks just like Tyke.  That's Tyke.  I was like, that guy looks just like him.  He rocked on that car. 
[02:38:30]  So I'm like, that's Tyke.  Wow.  He'll be performing with me tonight.  Cool.  And tomorrow.  Very cool.  Not bad.  He's in a commercial with Latrell Sprewell.  He's doing something right.  Yeah.  That's funny.  That's funny.  All right.  Here's Stephen.  Here.  She got a smile.  And she's flashing it right at me.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar. 
[02:39:00]  And I know that it's meant to be.  She got a walk.  Oh, she's walking over and I think it could be my day.  She got a friend.  Oh, she got a friend.  Now, while she's standing in her way.  It's a big fat friend.  Oh, God.  There's always one.  Big fat friend.  To wreck my f***ing fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby.  If it's boots, you want to knock.  Leave your chubby friend at home because she's going to block the cat. 
[02:39:30]  Now, I'm afraid of no man.  With any I'll contend.  But I cannot compete with your big fat friend.  Big fat friend.  So, big fat friend.  Ah, we meet again.  You will not leave her alone.  You roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments while you're sucking on a chicken bone. 
[02:40:00]  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you and your Achilles heel and he's sitting next to me.  It's my non-discriminating friend.  So, what's that your account?  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll nail you anyhow.  Yeah, I know he smells like whiskey and he's had a couple rounds.  With every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds. 
[02:40:30]  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal.  And your big fat friend.  Hey, that's all right, man.  Yeah.  Steven Lynch.  Thank you very much.  One, two, three, four, hit it.  Oh, it's naked girls.  Oh, it's naked girls.  Turn, turn, turn it off.  Turn, turn, turn it off.  Oh, it's porno. 
[02:41:00]  Oh, it's porno.  It's not good for you.  It's not good for you.  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Show.  Do Haas.  Do Haas.  Yeah.  Well, we got to wrap up the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, hey, hey.  Quickly, quickly.  We must, we kind of screwed up today, Opie.  We never brought up the fact that we need, we need girls for the softball game.  We need cheerleaders, sideline, pep up the crowd in your beautiful bikini. 
[02:41:30]  Girls, let's be honest, if you have a hot bod, we want you in your little tiny bikini  to help us out.  And ladies, this isn't like one of those things that you have to do things like those girls  with the money snatch.  This is just come on down in your bikini, strut around a little here in the studio, and, you  know, if we think you're the type of gal that would excite the crowd a bit, you're in. 
[02:42:00]  You know, and then you'll be on the sidelines cheering and helping out with the game on  the field.  And we'll make you very famous.  We'll put your, you know, your pictures up on the website.  Yeah.  And before you know it, maybe you're going out on appearances.  Who knows what transpires during this.  There you go.  So bikini tryouts start tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just show up between now and the softball game.  Just show up.  If you got one of those hot balls.  We assure you, you just show up.  Don't call.  Don't have to do anything.  Just show up with your bikini and you're in. 
[02:42:30]  If you wanted tickets but you couldn't get them and you want to see the game and you're  a hot chick, this is the way to do it.  Off, off, off.  You'll be on the field.  On the field.  By the dugouts.  In the action.  So, ladies, show up tomorrow.  We'd love to see, okay?  You know, I hope the girls from the money snatch don't show up.  All of them?  No.  A couple of them would be fine.  Like a couple of them, I hope, and they know who they are.  Show up.  Well, which ones, eh?  They know.  That could save us a lot of time.  The hot ones.  Instead of all of them coming down.  The hot ones.  Which ones, though?  They know who they are.  I know who he's talking about.  Right. 
[02:43:00]  See?  Lynch, he knows.  That old gag.  Todd from Buffalo.  I learned today O&A have ADD.  Wacky.  Ken from Columbus.  I learned I wish I was a teenage girl.  Yes.  Jerry from Medicine.  I learned Bonnie Lully had a gunshot.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  You lost him all that time, John.  Why couldn't they get that on Channel 9 News?  No, they show them answering phones.  Why don't they get him  on his daily dropping of everything he carries? 
[02:43:30]  Holy Christ.  Wasn't that the same dude  that dropped the Sam Adams out?  He dropped everything.  The guy cannot carry anything.  He dropped the six of Sam Adams.  He can't carry anything.  All right, listen.  Hey, Opie.  Center fielder right there.  Anthony, you could draft him.  Jerry from Madison.  I learned Bonnie Lee had a gunshot wound even before she met Robert Blake.  Al Mack from Clifton.  Today I learned it wasn't A or B.  It was CD3.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, musical dildo chairs next Friday. 
[02:44:00]  Look at that.  He's crying.  He's going to have a heart attack.  I jumped.  I thought I was getting shot at.  What the hell was that?  What did he trip on?  That was fantastic.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, Brenda Starr is still trying to make it.  Right.  Dave from D.C.  I learned today that the XFL show just wasn't the right vehicle for Opie and Anthony's talents.  Jersey Gary.  I learned not going to college is annoying.  Yeah.  He also learned to get away with the 25-year-old double homicide, confess on a wacky radio station,  and then pretend to be delusional.  He also learned all it took was a flaming Broadway star for Ant to remember his wedding anniversary. 
[02:44:30]  Greg from Philly.  I learned that Mario doesn't like the foreign money.  Right.  Someone got that cool.  Stewie from Staten Island.  I learned that if I did, what did I learn like you guys do bits, you wouldn't know what  I learned until next week.  Bro, I'll give him that one.  And finally, another one from Stewie.  I learned I'm more likely to grab another man's junk than Mario Cantone will grab a chick's  gold mine.  Yeah.  And that scares me.  I didn't quite get that.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  For those of you in Washington, D.C., tomorrow at Jack's in Springfield, Virginia?  That's correct.  You can get a little preview and see Evolution down there.  It's going on right after the Neil Diamond tribute.  Are you kidding?  No, I'm serious.  There's a Neil Diamond tribute opening for it.  It's tribute night at Jack's in Springfield.  Until the night became a brand new day.  Love on the rocks.  Yeah.  No, Jack's is in Springfield.  It's like one of the biggest clubs in Springfield.  You don't have to sell it to me, Joe.  I'll be there.  Oh, that's right. 
[02:45:30]  I'm selling that to the people listening on WJFK.  All right.  Cool.  We got to go.  Ben's freaking.  Ben's freaking and laughing at the same time tonight.  Ben almost woof.  Lynch.  Gotham tonight?  Gotham tonight.  Center stage.  Two shows tomorrow in New Rochelle.  Another guy that kills, man.  Yes.  So if you're in the area, go see Stephen Lynch, okay?  Thanks.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Very busy show tomorrow as well.  Ladies, show up in your bikinis starting tomorrow.  Right. </pre>
