<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts recounting their hangover from a party with Sammy Hagar the previous night, which continued at the Hard Rock Cafe.  They then read a critical letter from Kenneth Walker of Jamaica condemning their parody song mocking Reverend Al Sharpton, calling it disrespectful to minorities and biased against Sharpton compared to their treatment of Mayor Giuliani.  Opie and Anthony defended the song, arguing its accuracy and highlighting their frequent criticism of Giuliani, while criticizing Sharpton's lack of response to a local crime.

The show then hosted a disastrous interview with "The Greaseman," who promoted a new line of crayons with offensively named colors like "Chink Yellow," "Homo Pink," "Polish Purple," and "Wetback Brown." This led to his immediate removal from the studio by CBS executives. The hosts also discussed their positive experience at Sammy Hagar's show and a previous caller's comments about Hagar's contributions to Van Halen. A moment of silence was observed for another previous caller.

The conversation shifted to Joe Torre's prostate cancer diagnosis and the high number of Yankees who have been ill, prompting jokes about the stadium being built on nuclear waste.  They then played an audio clip of a sleepy Ted Williams being interviewed by Tom Brokaw.  The show received a call from someone claiming to be Babe Ruth calling from hell, filled with vulgar and offensive language, rambling anecdotes, and jokes.  They discussed car insurance costs, with Anthony complaining about a significant increase due to an old speeding ticket.  The show concluded with discussions of newly released tapes containing Nixon's racist remarks, more jokes about the Babe Ruth call, Barbie's 40th birthday, childhood memories and toys, and a listener-submitted video of Ken and Barbie dolls.

A subsequent segment began with a discussion of George Steinbrenner's emotional displays, contrasting his current tearfulness with his past combative nature. They reminisced about his feuds, particularly with Billy Martin, before transitioning to discussions of Joe Torre and Babe Ruth.  An audio clip of a speech Ruth gave to Little Leaguers shortly before his death was played.  This was followed by a mention of a (presumably prank) phone call from Babe Ruth from "hell," described as containing "salty" language and details about his womanizing, drinking, and Joe DiMaggio's afterlife.

The segment's latter half focused on a listener's email accusing Opie of dressing up his cats and photographing them. Opie vehemently denied this, leading to humorous banter and a discussion of the word "cunk," a word they had previously invented and used on a different show. They recounted the resulting controversy, including angry letters and calls, playfully repeating the word and emphasizing its absence from the dictionary. A caller used a similar-sounding word, causing a frantic, humorous moment as the hosts tried to avoid saying a censored word before their commercial break. The show ended with promotions for Stephen Lynch's performances at Caroline's.

[00:00:00]  the rock of new york 1027 wnew now that's a song that gets us in the mood for our show  anthony you're out of your mind ted nugent cat scratch fever metallica before that whiskey  in the jar from garage inc good afternoon what's up hey what up what up what up how you holding  up i'm a little tired we gotta thank uh sammy hagar for uh getting the entire new w staff  hung over today him and his tequila you walk around the halls and everyone's feeling the  effects of uh the tequila we all were drinking yesterday had a good time with sammy yesterday 
[00:00:30]  yes we did and then the party continued at the hard rock cafe sammy sounded great it was a lot  of fun yeah want to say hi to everyone we met good time very good time so then we move on from here i  guess yeah yeah on this hump day hump day yes well you want to start with a complaint letter or what  do you want to start with yeah yeah let's read this all right well once again uh our spies at  anyw uh got another one of the complaint letters in our hand intercepted we intercept these things 
[00:01:00]  from time to time to scott sherman yeah well kenneth walker walker from jamaica jamaica uh he wrote a  complaint letter to uh scott sherman vice president and general manager of wnew all right uh kenneth that  would be uh scott herman herman yeah drop the s drop the s and wow he sent it to the chief  financial financial officer of infinity broadcasting as well whoa all right kenneth means business here 
[00:01:30]  anthony he must be serious he must have a really really good uh complaint well let's read on here  dear gentlemen i am contacting you to voice my disapproval at the reworking of the song charlie  brown to insult reverend al sharpton oh come on while i understand that most of your listeners might not  care many minority listeners take exception at disparaging comments towards anyone of any ethnic group  who attempts to address the issue of police brutality and discrimination i sincerely doubt such a song 
[00:02:00]  would be made to ridicule the work of mayor rudolph giuliani who is a media whore if i've ever seen  one and who also asks on occasion why is everyone always picking on me it looks looks like you've just  lost about 12 listeners and 104.3 just gained them first scott muni now us with great disappointment  kenneth walker please kenneth come back  you know kenneth just hears what he wants to hear first of all because uh i believe that we have made 
[00:02:30]  fun of uh mayor giuliani probably two to three times more than we've made fun of reverend al sharpton  yes it's not equal by any mean you know what i think i think i'll write a rudy giuliani song  just to prove our point okay come up with one of those and uh me and joe will throw it together and uh  and we'll play that one all right we'll see if uh kenny uh calls back and says okay all right we are  equal opportunity offenders here but i mean kenneth has decided to you know you know close up his ears 
[00:03:00]  when we're talking about uh the mayor in bad light and as far as the reverend al song goes  there's nothing in that song that isn't uh true it hasn't been in the news it's based on fact  guy turns up every everywhere uh to get his mug on on camera everyone forgets about the tawana  brawley debacle this guy latched himself onto like a leech and that was just a bunch of bull  well where's uh where's reverend al sharpton's uh outrage over what happened in his community uh last  night yeah with that poor lady that's uh is trying to help the the needy in the neighborhood over 
[00:03:30]  there and she gets a 10 inch knife in the back hmm let's see opie what could be the reason he's not  doing anything oh yeah she's white that must be it yeah well there's no outrage or anything he's a  hypocrite where's reverend al he doesn't care about people he cares about black people which is all fine  and well but don't go under the guise that you're just you care about people and you're not a racist  oh please and kenneth uh you say we we lost 12 listeners well actually we only have three to begin

[00:09:30]  singer and a pretty decent guitar player you forget that we were saying we were saying that at the  hard rock all of a sudden he picked up his guitars like he did most of the soloing yeah most of the  soloing i forgot because it was like for 11 years he didn't really get to play a lead guitar  anyway you joined van halen you don't exactly think about going against eddie yeah i mean come  on but you forget that he was a good uh guitar player in his own right so absolutely so he had  all that and brought it to van halen which is why they did go to go to an unbelievable level and again 
[00:10:00]  nothing against gary chiron which sammy said yesterday you guys said because of uh the boston  connection yeah you know nothing against him at all but it's just it didn't work it didn't work on  that album like sammy explained too a lot of the uh guitar work on van halen three was not uh friendly  for vocals for any vocal work so he's absolutely right so yeah hats off to that caller yesterday  very insightful uh and then of course we had that moment of silence yesterday too with that other  phone caller wasn't a dry eye in the room which was it i don't remember he was just saying something

[00:14:00]  dimaggio subject who else saw the great picture in the post of ted williams falling asleep on today's  show you know that's the downside about dragging some of these people into the limelight after they've  uh been living a private life for a few years you know there's a reason for that there's a reason  they're not really in the public eye it's because they're uh falling asleep falling asleep and we  mentioned a couple days ago i just don't want to see ted williams all old and stuff nope a great  baseball player you want to remember him young yeah and vile yeah vile vile virile whatever

[00:39:30]  wnew  ever last what it's like  on the way we got hole  and zeppelin  from zeppelin 2  it's opie and anthony  phones are a little slow today  we like getting you guys on the air with stuff  mm-hmm  but no one has anything worthwhile  not today huh  no  it happens  212-757-1027  if you want to get into the show today  mm-hmm  if you uh  want to comment on anything we've discussed thus far  that's cool  or if you got something brand new  that's all right too  all right  those uh  nixon tapes that they released 
[00:40:00]  showing nixon was a racist  i haven't seen those yet  oh my god opie  he was saying things about the jews  he called uh  one  one jewish guy on  on a tape  a kike  he was using that kind of language  the president of the united states  can you believe that  that was back in the 70s  yeah  yeah  you were kind of allowed to  use those words still  no i don't think the president  could have uh  said something like that  it was it was on tape though  of course nixon uh  taping everything  well  was he at a  a press conference or something 
[00:40:30]  or is this like  no this is a private  inside the white house  he  he had tapes all hooked up uh  in in the oval office and everything  mm-hmm  that's what got him in trouble  with the water gate  right  because everything was taped  but um  now they're releasing tapes  that he was calling  you know  people that had that  who's the  who's that black boy  wow  yeah yeah  stuff like that  just really rank stuff  but um  i'm convinced at this point  that you gotta be  a complete scumbag  to be the president  of the united states  of america  you think  i know that's a pretty  heavy statement  like in what way 
[00:41:00]  i don't  after just  you know  reading more and more  about clinton  and now  nixon  it just seems like  it's just a job  for someone  that's a scumbag  that has just  the biggest  hugest ego  i think it just proves  that the  you can't just put them  up there  just because they're  the president  it's like  hey look at this guy  he's like a god  or something  nah they're just  regular uh  jerk offs  you know  with all  all the weaknesses  inherent in all of us  open  but um  i don't understand  uh  nixon stuff comes out

[00:58:00]  coming down  with prostate  cancer  yeah  hopefully they  caught it early  and everything  will be okay  it's just very  tragic  no joke here  i'm being serious  my dad's suffering  through a little bit  of that  so it's not  it's not a fun  thing  i guess not  but uh  it just puts  everything in  perspective  joe torrey  the most liked  sports figure  in new york  these days  just riding a  wave of success  the last few  years  yeah  and then out of  nowhere  boom  he has to deal  with this  it's just amazing  how that works  did you see uh 
[00:58:30]  steinbrenner  yeah  well you know  for the first time  in steinbrenner's  uh career  he has the right  to cry  he has the right  to cry  i don't know  why  come on dude  he just looks so  goofy  well they interviewed  him at spring  training today  yeah yeah  about the whole thing  and he was kind of  getting a little  choked up again  i mean i'm sick  of seeing george  steinbrenner cry  i don't care if it's  a good reason or not  or whatever  i'm just tired  of seeing  what happened  what happened  to george 
[00:59:00]  the george  that's always fighting  remember him  and billy martin  that was great stuff  just always  bashing each other  and he was the  ruled with an iron fist  the tough guy  and now it's  every time you see him  he's  the yankees  are the best team  in baseball  he's had a lot  to cry about lately  joe  you are the best  manager 
[00:59:30]  in baseball  and he cried  over joe  dimaggio  you are the greatest  yankee ever  that's what we get now 
[01:00:00]  the whole team  is behind him  and he's gonna come back  to the greatest team  in baseball  that's what we get now  out of george  where's the 70s george  who wanted to crack  some skulls  now he's got the  crazy eddie outfit on  yeah  remember his big brawls  you know him  getting pissed off  reggie jackson 
[01:00:30]  i mean it was great  yeah  well he's getting up  there in years  and take it  joe  we'll be waiting  for you to come back  greatest manager  in baseball  god  you're right  well we just hope  they caught the cancer  early anthony  well of course  you know  no ill will 
[01:01:00]  toward joe tory  not at all  just sometimes  when you're a public  guy like that  and you have that  image  that steinbrenner image  it's kind of hard  to just see him  deteriorating  before your eyes  so we got  so we got on the subject  of joe tory  yeah  and then we started  talking about babe ruth  and how the final  days of his life  were not pretty  no  no  no  and i have  actual audio  of babe ruth 
[01:01:30]  giving a speech  to some little leaguers  this was pretty much  weeks before he died  i believe  yeah  and this is as real  as it comes  so you want  let me play the audio  again  right  and then we'll get  into the whole  babe ruth calling us  today from hell  okay let's hear babe  but this is the  the babe  yeah  thank you very much  ladies and gentlemen  you know how bad  my voice sounds  well it feels  just as bad  you know this baseball  game of ours  comes up 
[01:02:00]  from the  the only real game  i think in the world  baseball  you gotta start  from way down the bottom  when you're six  or seven years  of age  you gotta let it  grow up with you  and if you're successful  and you try hard enough  you're bound to come out  on top  just like these boys  that come to the top 
[01:02:30]  now  thank you  give it away  if that isn't a  anti-smoking commercial  right there  right there  that's not  fun  yeah  he's just chugging  anyway  so we played that  and then out of nowhere  because we got  caller id here  at the station  so we can prove  that it was  a phone call  from hell  we had babe ruth  on the line earlier  from hell  his language 
[01:03:00]  a little salty  but you must remember  back in his day  he was quite the womanizer  bad language  drinking  just kind of  nasty guy  pouring around  yeah  playing hungover  oh there he goes  babe ruth everyone  our exclusive interview  with babe  oh that is just so wrong  it kind of stinks  that he poured a beer  in his voice box  because we wanted to talk  about Joe DiMaggio  yeah  see if he made it  to hell or heaven  or not 
[01:03:30]  well maybe we could  recontact him  who knows  the rock of new york  1027  WNEW  Neil Young  and slide before that  from the Goo Goo Dolls  it's Opie and Anthony  closing up another show  I guess  wow look at that  the time flew today  and you guys got to get  to Johnny Lang  Johnny Lang  that's right  Opie's not going  read the little email  from Keith  yeah you know  it's hard to take  on the whole world  when your girlfriend 
[01:04:00]  calls and tells  the whole city  that you know  supposedly I dress up  the cats  and we take pictures  I can't even hear you  say that  wait Ant  come on  I know I take  a lot of abuse  on this show  and that's okay  because we all do  right  we all do  do I  dress up my cats  Anthony  and take cute  little pictures  look I'm going  to say this  one more time  Opie does not  dress up his cats  no can't you do  it in your regular voice  no one's going to  believe Clinton  come on 
[01:04:30]  to the best of my  knowledge  no  you don't  dress up your cats  to the best of my  knowledge  that was just a  horrible mistake  to take that phone  call live last  Friday right  I'm getting killed  that was so funny  how are we supposed  to take on  the entire world  with people thinking  that I'm that much  of a puss  Sandy calls up  sweetie  I got the pictures  back  you want to see  Bono and Dave  with the sunglasses  on it's so cute  and I was just like  oh my god  why did I hit  this phone 
[01:05:00]  why  I remember  it was the last  call too  we were thinking  should we go to  the phones  and then  does it in there  no  no  there's just abuse  about how  all of a sudden  it turned into  obviously  from what I see  Sandy put some  glasses on your cats  snapped a couple  of pics  she thinks they're  really cute  and she called you  to tell you  how cute they were  while we're trying  to do a radio show  right  so  but  it gets twisted  around into  now Opie's  dressing his cats  in ballerina costumes 
[01:05:30]  and having sex  with them  well look  Keith  I just added  the having sex  well Keith  from Manhattan  Keith from Manhattan  writes on the  instant feedback  I guess Opie  is not going to  see Giant Light  tonight because  it's dress up  night with the  cats  what a pussy  I'd rather you  guys like abuse  me for the whole  James thing  than this  James  is it a  dress up  night  no  shut up  no  no  okay  just making sure  I had a really  good joke but  I'm not allowed  to say that word  on the radio 
[01:06:00]  anymore  which one  think  cats  dress up  fun with cats  whoa what  pusky  thank you  it was a pretty  good joke too  but it's not  going to happen  oh oh in that  context  yeah we're allowed  to use the word  pussy if we're  going you're like  a pussy man  yeah yeah  because it means  like wimp  but if we  describe a lady's  private area  using that  right  say that word  then the boss  upstairs has a  real problem with  it so  that's why we  used the word  cunk  scared you there 
[01:06:30]  didn't I  scared you  didn't I  that was my  invention  of course  oh wow  that brings up  the nice  memories  yeah  working at  another station  we invented  the word  cunk  right  c-u-n-k  cunk  cunk  it's not a  word  you will not  find it in  the dictionary  don't send  in c-o-n-k  which is a  word  there is no  word  c-u-n-k 
[01:07:00]  look it up in  the dictionary  for yourself  the women  wanted us  dead  they were  protesting  writing  you know  hate mail  and they  wanted us  off the radio  for using a  word that  doesn't exist  that's how  uptight a lot  of people are  sometimes we'd  get a call  from an  irate woman  about something  we did  and we'd  just turn  around and  go  shut up  you  cunk  and  silence  oh my god  we get  letters  and our  bosses  would have  to come  to us  and say  did you  call a  woman 
[01:07:30]  a  cunk  like yeah  it's not a  word  look it up  so I guess  we gotta debut  the word  cunk  in New York  now  use it  in your  language  to show  what kind  of a  person  you are  use the  word  cunk  use it  it's a  fun word  use it to  someone you  know  and they'll  lose their  ass  and then you  go look  look it up  it's not a  word  mary's  being a  real  cunk  yeah
