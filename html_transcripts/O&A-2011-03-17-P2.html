<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with Andrew Dice Clay, in studio, performing several Elvis impersonations.  His performances were met with a mixture of amusement and critique from Opie, Anthony, and other on-air personalities, who commented on his vocal abilities and song selections.  Technical difficulties with both audio and lighting were also discussed throughout this segment.  The show then transitioned to a recurring segment featuring the persistently irritating caller/guest Bobo, who was repeatedly asked, then essentially forced, to leave the studio due to his disruptive behavior and perceived entitlement to free things and excessive airtime.  The hosts and staff expressed considerable frustration with his presence.

Following this, a segment played clips from a past show, specifically a 2006 St. Patrick's Day broadcast, featuring comedian Louis Twitchell, who has Tourette's Syndrome. The clip showcased Twitchell's performance and the reactions of Opie, Anthony, and Patrice O'Neal (heard in the background).  The show's closing moments featured a discussion about the heavy workload of producer Pepper Hicks, along with mentions of upcoming appearances at an Imus event and the upcoming Ron and Fez show. The show ended with a bizarre incident involving a drunken listener, Chris, who won a MiFi by urinating in his pants on air, a feat that elicited both amusement and disgust from Opie and Anthony.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  After ONA Live.  Bobo, we appreciate you doing this, and I mean, you have added such a wealth of content to the show today that I can't thank you enough.  But it wasn't just you that we were talking about today.  If you remember, and the people, quite frankly, can't take any more of you.  Yeah, they really hate you.  I mean, Derek, are you done with Bobo? You're totally.  I'm totally done with it.  Yeah, I thought so.  Bobo, we have a lot of other stuff to get to. You understand that. We were talking about Dice today.  Yeah, I understand that. I heard the first two hours of the show. 
[00:00:30]  Well, that's good to know. There was two other ones that were great, too.  But what happened with Dice was he was wearing an eye patch, and that led to Ant doing pirate Dice. Did you hear that?  Yeah, I heard that.  How was that? You think that was funny?  I was laughing, and so was my mother was.  Well, that's great to know.  I bet Bobo could do better. I mean, look, not for nothing, Ant's good, and he's really good at combo stuff.  Bobo has some real skills.  Let's see bunny rabbit Dice.  You're Dice, yeah! I'm out being like a bunny rabbit! 
[00:01:00]  That's terrific.  See?  If you want to hear a taste of what Dice really sounds like, this is Dice singing Elvis Presley.  Bobo won't be here when we get back.  Thank you.

[00:13:30]  Now you know how we feel  We had Ron Howard on before you came in  After O&A  Live  After O&A  I'm Sam Roberts  That was the great Andrew Dice Clay  Who, by the way  Was trying to call in yesterday  He was the mystery guest  In the Ian Halbrin situation  But he hung up  Before we got to him  He was the secret weapon  That we referenced  But we talked about him earlier  Bobo's still here  Why the fuck are you still here?  Oh jeez  Derek's back 
[00:14:00]  Bobo  You were supposed to go home  Or go to your fucking parade  But why the fuck are you still here?  We kind of ended the segment  Remember?  Yeah  And then I played the bit  I said alright Bobo  It was great for you to stop by  And everybody's kind of done with you  Yeah that's right  It was a good segment  It was a solid but  Why is he here?  I mean I don't know  I  Cause now Derek's getting pissed at me  Cause he doesn't  He thinks that I'm keeping you here  I told you to  You know  Kind of hit the brakes right?  Right  So get up  There you go  Put down the headphones  And go to your parade 
[00:14:30]  Wow  And hopefully get run over by a float  Oh Derek  You don't mean that do you?  No I really do  Oh shit  Bobo  It was great for you to stop by  Again it was great  I wish that this had ended  The way the last segment ended  That was more pleasant  You know  But I mean maybe you wanna  If you wanna grab some audio  Or something at the parade  You know  Leave  Leave  Alright  Yeah just  Leave  Derek will hook you up with a recorder  Holy shit man  It really pisses you  He really  He really makes me upset 
[00:15:00]  Just looking at him  Like your mood changed  When he got here  Yes  He just got here for the last 10 minutes  Of the show  And you completely  Like I feel for him  As like a human being  Right  But just seeing him  And just listening to him  Fucking really irritates me  Wait is it cause you know  Nothing productive or good  Is gonna come out of it  Nothing will ever come out of him  No  Nothing at all  And so you just feel like  You're looking at him  You're wasting your time  Exactly  Like he's just  A walking waste of time  He's a walking waste of time  Absolutely  We've tried to get him  To get his act together  And he won't  Because he wants to be on the show 
[00:15:30]  That's the thing  Like  He won't get his act together  Because he thinks  He's gonna be on the radio  So you think  He wouldn't get a daytime job  Because it would mean  That he would not be available  In the mornings anymore  He actually admitted that  I think at one point  Where he said  That he wouldn't get a job  Because he wanted to be on the radio  E-Rock  You're in here  You also get pissed  About Bobo  Yeah  Bobo just assumes  He's entitled to everything  That  You know  That we have  If stuff comes into the studio  From sponsors or whatever  He just goes  I'll take one of those 
[00:16:00]  I'm gonna get it  Yeah  That's what he says  He just calls up  And he just assumes  That he's fucking  A part of the show  And that he can get free shit  And he did that for  For Car Crash Comedy  He wanted fucking  Free seats and shit too  It's like  You could sign up  On the email list  Like everybody else did  And get a fair shot  Like everybody else did  We're not gonna give you  Free shit dude  Because he called in  The day before Car Crash  And when we told him  There were no more seats  Unfortunately  He didn't understand  He got all upset  Like  How dare we not  Let him know  That there was an event  That he was not going  To be a part of  Yeah exactly  So I fucked the guy 
[00:16:30]  I don't  You know  He annoys the shit  He better not be  I see eyes moving behind me  Yeah I mean  He might be being guided  By somebody  I mean there's  A couple things  I was gonna throw to  Go yell at him out the door  He'll just waltz in here  Cause he's fucking  Danny's now opening the door  What are you doing here?  Why are you back?  No listen to me  Listen to me  You're doing the show  I mean who's  Who's  Is it  It's  After Obi-Nanthony live  I'm Sam Roberts  That's how they all start  Right? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  Remember when I said  Alright see you later  And it was nice and pleasant  And you know  The host kind of said goodbye  Yeah  Well now you're making it unpleasant  And it's like  The people at home  Are gonna be like  Why do they have to bully him?  But  We tried to say goodbye  What the fuck was that?  What is that?  What was that?  Your cell phone?  No I accidentally turned my phone off  Like I was about to leave  Okay  Turn it off now?  She sounds like a pacemaker  It's a stupid fucking 24 fucking clock countdown  Look  I wish there was a fucking bomb on him 
[00:17:30]  Bobo's here to celebrate St. Patrick's Day  And if there's one thing  Yeah Danny?  Well I was just gonna say  This is how stupid Bobo is  Because on the  The reason I had paraded Bobo back down here again  To the delight of all the fans out there  Of course  I was trying  He came into the back office where we were working  And he was really down  He was really depressed  And I said what happened Bobo  And he told me to leave  His segment was over  Yeah he's done  We started listening  But it wasn't over  Because you guys were still trashing him  So I was like  Bobo you can't let them do that to you  Oh  Thank you for that  You gotta get back in there  And I was like  You're Charlie Sheen 
[00:18:00]  You're winning  You got tiger blood in you  So get in there  And go and show them  How you're a motherfucking warlock  So he did that right?  He's paying attention  He's taking his phone apart  He's taking his phone apart  Why are you taking the battery  Out of your phone?  Can't you just turn it off  Like a normal person?  There's no answers to these questions  Talking to a microphone  Mike  Mike  You've been on the air before  I think this phone freezes  That's why  Obviously  Obviously  Yeah okay  Well I think we're gonna have to save  The Danny and Mars thing  For tomorrow then  Unfortunately  Because that's some more juicy stuff  Going on  But Bobo is here to celebrate
