<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast detailed a whirlwind of topics, primarily centered around the burgeoning relationship between co-host Anthony Cumia and traffic reporter Jill Nicolini. The show opened by revisiting a previous broadcast where Mick Foley relayed a message from Nicolini expressing romantic interest in Cumia, culminating in a live phone call where she directly asked him out.  This sparked a flurry of sexually suggestive jokes and speculation from Opie, the staff, and numerous callers, fueled by Nicolini’s subsequent subtle “secret messages” on-air – a hair flip, nose scratch, ear touch, and a wink.  Unexpectedly, guest Bill Shatner offered dating advice amidst the crude humor.  The hosts played a self-produced advertisement promoting the developing romance and later shared suggestive text messages from Cumia detailing his date with Nicolini. Jill Nicolini's father even called in, adding to the chaotic atmosphere.

The following segment dealt with the absence of both Cumia and Nicolini, who called in sick after their date.  Opie and the show, with Colin Quinn filling in for Cumia, engaged in highly suggestive and offensive speculation about their date, playing an unconvincing phone message from Anthony feigning illness.  Listener calls continued the humorous and often vulgar theories.  Jill Nicolini's father was expected but didn't call in.  This segment also included clips of news anchors, particularly weathermen, making on-air mistakes.  A rumor about Jill Nicolini gluing body parts to a hockey player's thigh was also briefly discussed.

The broadcast then shifted to a harsh critique of the *Sex and the City* movie. Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and others relentlessly mocked the actresses, particularly Sarah Jessica Parker's appearance, using derogatory terms like "hags." They dissected a Rolling Stone review, finding it equally absurd.  The discussion veered into various tangents, including a bizarre weather report segment featuring a cockroach, a listener's flatulence, and a "Gas for Gas" giveaway promoting on-air flatulence.  The segment included listener calls, clips from the *Sex and the City* trailer met with intense negativity, and snippets of other audio, including a Family Guy joke about Sarah Jessica Parker and a purported sex tape of Kristen Davis. Bill Burr contributed a brief recorded message. The overall tone remained highly vulgar, irreverent, and sexually charged throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN, North Las Vegas, the home of the Dan Patrick Show.  All sports, all the time. No excuses.  Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Some people don't like you to mention certain things.  Some people don't want you to say this.  Some people don't want you to say that.  Some people think if you mention some things, they might happen.  Some people are really f***ing stupid. 
[00:00:30]  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  You are listening to the worst.  Not the best.  The absolute worst.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's absolutely awful.  It's one of my favorite Metallica songs.  Hey, hey, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.  That horrible drummer Lars does a good job in this.  But if you ask Danny, you know, he just sucks and he's overrated. 
[00:01:00]  Lars is ridiculous.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We have to go back to yesterday's show because we got all sorts of updates.  We got newspapers interested in this story.  Really?  The fans are very interested in this story.  Are they, though?  I think your mommy's very interested in this possibility.  I haven't spoken to my mommy.  I know your sister, Rochin, said, don't blow this one, Anthony. 
[00:01:30]  Why?  A lot of pressure on you.  I understand that.  Yes, there is.  Is there really?  Ah, the message board's going nuts with the news that there might be some love in the air.  I was steering clear of any message boards.  Oh, you don't want to go there, right?  I don't want to look.  No, it's a little ugly right now.  But basically, how do we begin this?  I guess we had Mick Foley on the show yesterday. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  One of our good friends.  And he just did an interview with Channel 11 here in New York.  And then he had a message from Jill Nicolini.  Which was odd.  I thought it was going to just be, you know, hey, tell the guys I said hi.  Right.  It was a bombshell.  Are you dubbing this a bombshell?  Oh, yeah.  It came out of nowhere.  Out of nowhere?  A bombshell?  A bombshell.  Wow.  Okay.  So what we did, because it was going on all morning yesterday, we kind of condensed it down to a quick, like, minute and a half here. 
[00:02:30]  You got the Mick Foley telling us what Jill Nicolini said.  And then I think we got a phone call from Jill Nicolini.  And then I think we finished it up with dating advice from Bill Shatner.  Is that what we're about to hear?  That's not in there yet.  Oh, that's not in there yet.  Okay.  Because then it took on a life of its own.  And Bill Shatner, who was scheduled to do an interview, now is giving you dating advice.  Yeah.  So this is how it went down yesterday.  It's the condensed version. 
[00:03:00]  Swimmies.  She said she is a single.  Sorry, Bill.  I don't know if he would give that version or a pair of a bikini made out of lead.  No one knows what really happened.  Oh, no, the news is doing another grape stomping event.  Uh-oh.  Not how the last one turned out.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  So this starts with Mick Foley with the message from Jill Nicolini. 
[00:03:30]  She said she is A, single, and B, interested.  What?  Well, I'm newly single, by the way.  As she told me.  And I got to go.  I got to go.  Let's get Jill Nicolini on before she does her next traffic.  Oh, Jesus.  She has nothing to do between traffic reports.  Let's see if we did.  I want to get to the bottom of this crush that she might have on it. 
[00:04:00]  I want to watch Anthony fall apart.  Oh, yeah.  Jill.  Yes, hello.  Let's understand.  Hi, Jill.  We got Mick Foley in studio.  And you guys just had him on TV.  Jill, I...  Hello, Mick.  Hi, guys.  It's okay that I quoted you directly, right?  Yes.  My quote directly to Mick was that I'm single these days.  I heard Anthony's single.  And single and?  And is he available?  Uh, yeah.  Well, you see, there's a lot of girls here at the CW who want dibs on Anthony.  And I said, well, hey, I'm recently single. 
[00:04:30]  Why can't I get him?  So I'm calling to ask if maybe Anthony wants to go out.  And we're both out on Long Island, right?  Yeah, we're close by, practically neighbors.  And grew up, you know, similar areas, neighborhoods, same friends, same people.  We have a lot in common, I think.  And you enjoy maybe going out and having a drink or something?  I would love to.  But don't take me out, like, on Thursday, Thursday or anything.  No, no, no.  I wouldn't do that.  Is this a bit, or would you really go out on a date with Anthony? 
[00:05:00]  I really would go out on a date with Anthony.  Oh, you guys really should go out.  What day?  You want to go have a drink?  What day are you going to do this?  Let's do it.  You tell me.  Next week I'm available.  Next week I'll call Jill.  You're available at noon today?  Well, I'll stop by on the way home and grab you.  I'll call Jill and we'll set something up.  Give it a few days.  We'll look desperate.  And that was what went on yesterday.  Just watching dumb Anthony try to end that before it got something bad happening.  Is that what I was doing? 
[00:05:30]  I'll email you.  I'll call you.  I'll call you.  Hang up.  Now, immediately.  Yeah.  There's too many tools on the phone.  Oh, we're going to read it.  I'm going to fast forward a year into this relationship.  Anthony will just come in like staring straight ahead.  What happened?  She didn't come home again last night.  She'll ruin him.  She's going to ruin Anthony.  Hey, I hope you should take care of this.  We haven't even had our first phone call. 
[00:06:00]  We've been killing.  Would you just stop with the predictions of the future?  We've been killing Anthony ever since that went down yesterday.  And then after the show yesterday, we had to go into Tim's studio and we kind of like just, you know, we kind of riff into the microphones and try to come up with a promo that they can run here in New York City.  And here's just some of the audio.  This was supposed to be just a quick, like five seconds.  Opie here.  My pal Anthony is deeply in love with Jill Nicolini.  Wait a minute. 
[00:06:30]  That doesn't mean...  What?  To be a little more subtle.  Why?  Because it's not a love or anything.  We're going to just go out for a couple of drinks.  Like I said, Anthony is deeply in love with Jill Nicolini.  Why does this have to turn into like fifth grade?  There's a love thing happening.  Yeah, yeah.  You and Jill Nicolini, the traffic girl from Channel...  Are we sitting in a tree?  K-I-S-S-I-N-G?  I don't know. 
[00:07:00]  Are you?  What?  Why can't two adults just go out and have a drink or something and talk without you guys just being total jackasses about it?  Are you going to stupor?  Shut up.  There's not one moment that I could just have on the show without it having to turn into some goddamn fifth grade event with you juveniles. 
[00:07:30]  What base are you hoping to get to?  See?  Exactly.  Exactly.  I'm thinking third base.  What do you think?  Shut up.  So that was right after the show yesterday.  And as we do this, I see Anthony staring at the TV.  I'm all distracted now.  At his future wife.  Future wife.  Look at all those green cars.  The traffic looks good today.  Yeah, does it?  Doesn't it?  Look at...  Oh, there's an accident in Jersey.  Point it out, Jill.  Oh. 
[00:08:00]  That's it.  Oh, that's roadways.  I thought that was...  Oh, there was the hair flip.  Oh, no.  Oh, there's a little ear scratch.  Is that for Anthony?  Yeah, there...  Hold on, hold on.  What?  There may have actually been a coded message in that when I had the guys watching in the office.  Did she...  No, she didn't say it in that?  Oh, wait.  Well, now we've got to give you the update.  That was a message, by the way.  We're...  Yeah, yeah.  Of course it was.  I don't know.  We got it.  We got...  So around 5 o'clock, 5.30, we're all in the office.  And Steve pops his head out and he goes, watch Jill's traffic. 
[00:08:30]  She's going to have a secret message for Anthony.  I swear to God.  Is that true?  Very true.  Thank you.  And what was the secret message, the first secret message she did today on TV for Anthony?  When you see the...  Yeah, she said something like, it's a secret message.  That means call me.  It was a hair flip and a nose scratch, I believe.  Yeah.  Right.  Secret message.  So Steve runs out and goes, Jill's going to give Anthony a secret message.  It's going to be a hair flip and an itch of the nose.  And we're like, shut up.  So then she pops on and we're watching her traffic and she flips her hair. 
[00:09:00]  And then at the end, she like just, you know, scratches her nose real fast.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like she's giving secret messages to Anthony instead of doing the traffic.  She does the traffic.  What's the signal?  She's going to wiggle her bosoms after announcing a truck fire.  And then there was, um, then there was a wink.  Well, then, oh, my God, that was funny, but she's not going to, like, continue this.  She's got a job to do.  Uh-oh.  So then there was another text that said... 
[00:09:30]  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm sorry for interrupting.  There was a coded message in that last one.  Yes.  As well?  Yes.  Jimmy caught it.  It was the ear touch.  The ear.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like Carol Burnett at the end of this joke.  She's been writing, Steve, in between traffic reports, going, this is what I'm going to  do next for Anthony.  This is the real deal.  What was the second secret message?  Because that one was really funny.  It was at the very end of her report.  She winked at the camera.  Yeah, she goes, I'm going to wink at the camera.  That's a message for Anthony.  What was the message?  Does that make sure he calls me?  That was a call me, Anthony. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  She's got a pretty good wink.  She's, like, pretty...  Yeah.  It didn't look like...  You know, some people can't wink.  It looks like they've got a bug in their eye or something.  Yeah.  She gets a real quick wink there.  Right at the end of the traffic, she gave probably the most seductive wink I've ever  seen in my life.  With her big eyes.  She just gave a big blink.  Oh, they're big, aren't they, Anthony?  Of course.  She's starting to notice everything, huh?  Watch her become obsessed.  And then, like, Anthony's like, it's not going to work out.  And then she gives little signals like she hangs an Anthony doll by the way.  She's still in the traffic. 
[00:10:30]  And I hope an escalator's on fire on the expressway.  So if you're stuck in traffic, we apologize.  But, you know, the traffic girl's too busy giving secret messages to Anthony today.  She's doing the traffic.  What the hell's going on?  She's doing her job very fine.  Now, a girl like Jill Nicolini, right?  It's Friday.  You've got to call, like, right now.  She's booked by noon for the weekend.  I can't call right now.  We're both working.  It's very unprofessional. 
[00:11:00]  She obviously isn't.  She's delivering the traffic.  Do you have a secret message for her, Anthony?  Uh, yeah.  Come over my house.  Everywhere I look around.  What the hell is this?  Love is in the air.  All right.  Every sound, every sound.  And I don't know if I'm being a fool. 
[00:11:30]  Don't know if I'm being wise.  But it's something that I must believe in.  Right.  All right.  All right.  Love is in the air.  Oh.  Yeah, baby.  Whisper of the trees.  All right.  All right.  How long is this going to go?  Yes, love is in the air.  Right.  I'm trying to find some sound effects.  Chill.  Haven't that one phone call yet?  Huh?  It hasn't been a phone call yet. 
[00:12:00]  Well, she's waiting.  You guys are every douche friend at the bar when one guy tries to, like, maybe strike up  a conversation with a girl.  Because all the guys went out, and they're looking to, like, score with a chick.  And one guy happens to get a conversation going with a girl.  And every other guy that's there with him has to be douche.  Now, this is one guy who just got, like, kind of thrown out of baseball. 
[00:12:30]  All of a sudden, got called up by the Yankees.  Someone from their cell phone writes, Ant's just sitting there all smiley with butterflies  in his tummy.  This is like high school, man.  Yeah.  We're too old.  The humor, everything.  He ran in this morning making little, like, little gun fingers, and he was going, TGIF.  Oof.  Wow.  Boo!  TGIF for that joke.  Thank God it's finished.  Whoa. 
[00:13:00]  Oof.  Oh, wow.  Any more secret messages?  Can we get her on the phone?  Sure.  Jesus, why are you guys going to just ruin, you guys will ruin everything.  She's not doing her job.  Mike, New York City, what's up?  She's not doing her job.  She's giving you secret messages.  Yeah, we have to talk about it.  She's got a very important job, you know.  She gave the message to a man with no ear or teeth to give you.  The last time I saw a pair of jugs, that big two hillbillies were blowing on them. 
[00:13:30]  Whip them out Wednesday.  Get a wow sticker.  Get flashed.  Get happy.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, here's your future wife.  What did you say?  Jill.  Jill, call me.  Jill Nicolini, everyone, from Channel 11 here in New York City.  Hi, Anthony.  I'll let you guys talk in.  Oh, thank you, Opie.  Jimmy and I will be over here.  Yeah, well, I've been watching your traffic, Jill, and your secret messages are very cute. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, thank you.  They're just signals because I want you to know I'm thinking about you, and I'm waiting for you to call.  Hey, Jill.  Sorry, Anthony.  Sorry to jump in.  Of course, he jumps in.  Why wouldn't he?  No, because a lot of listeners, I know how they are, they're not going to believe us until they hear it from Jill herself.  Jill, is it true you've been sending secret messages to Anthony all morning long during your traffic?  Yes, that is 100% true.  I think I started with a little hair flip, a little nose scratch, a little winky wink. 
[00:14:30]  Winky wink.  And, wait, I made a reference about calling us, Ross, a tip line, and I really meant for Anthony to call me.  That was for you.  That was a call.  Well, Jill, you will absolutely get a call.  As long as you don't call me restricted, I don't pick up a restricted call, so you've got to call.  I'll call you restricted.  I'm a full week, please.  It's a restraining order.  No, faxes bank account numbers if you want to. 
[00:15:00]  So, Anthony, I heard some of the show yesterday, and I heard that I'm moving in, and you're going to be driving a Honda?  Yeah, apparently people think things are going to change.  I'll ask you this.  You don't like kids.  I've been hearing that you're having a hard time with children these days.  Are you looking for a relationship, maybe, that ends with marriage and children at some point? 
[00:15:30]  I want a lot of kids, like five.  You want five kids?  I do.  I really do.  It's a matter of finding the right person, though, and then, yeah.  Well, yeah, see, it's a matter of finding the right person, and that's, I think, you know, something that can be dealt with over time.  Oh, my God, you're crazy.  Where we can hang out.  You want to be?  You want to be?  Yeah, if anybody don't.  Yeah, exactly.  We can, you know, hang out, talk a little.  At some point, if things are going well, I'm sure that discussion will come up. 
[00:16:00]  Well, the discussion's here now.  Don't avoid it.  Do you or do you not want kids, Anthony?  You know, people know me off the air as really loving children.  Oh, my God.  What is up?  I have a soft spot for kids.  Yeah, I love kids.  The more, the merrier.  I say.  She's going to ruin them.  Oh, yeah.  You are done.  Done, my friend. 
[00:16:30]  More the merrier, so five is okay with you.  Five is a good.  If that's enough for you, I mean, five is fine.  But you have said in the, should I talk here?  I don't want to pull up your spot, but you have said that kids ruin a girl's body.  No.  Girls, if girls are in shape, they snap right back is what it is.  And Jill's in very good shape.  That's that.  And also, we could, if there was a problem with that, we could always have a surrogate mother. 
[00:17:00]  So, you know, it could be my egg, your sperm, and someone else could carry it, and then my body would still remain perfect.  You know, if you're up for that, and they could take it with them, and take care of it, and raise it.  I wouldn't mind that either.  Thank you.  So, and I also heard some of William Shatner's comments, and when we do go out, are you really going to record me, or?  No.  I would never do that, Vader, our little private moment.  You promise? 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, I really swear I would never do something like that.  That would be an awful intrusion.  You know what?  Make believe we're not here, and just, like, set it up for the weekend.  This doesn't count with your phone call, just to let you know.  This is a group phone call.  Yeah.  So, I'm expecting a private phone call later, but we can pretend.  No, I will absolutely call you, and we will set something up for next week, during the week.  I'm excited.  Yeah.  I think she wants to, uh...  Why not the weekend?  Why not a Saturday, maybe, or a Sunday? 
[00:18:00]  Because it's short notice, and I don't want to put her in an awkward position, where she already has plans.  I do have some family obligations on Saturday.  See?  I know things like this.  Yeah.  So, we'll talk, and we'll start out, maybe, with something, an early dinner during the week,  because I know we're both morning people with work.  Yeah, that kind of works, you know, to our advantage.  We both have the same hours.  Yeah.  It's kind of nice to find someone who wants to go to sleep early, you know, and...  Well, wrong guy.  Yeah, no. 
[00:18:30]  What time do you go to bed, usually?  Uh, anywhere between ten and two in the morning.  That's exactly what I do.  See?  It all depends on, you know, what's going on, so...  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, maybe if we're out having a good time, it'll be one of those later nights, uh, and,  uh, you know, if we're, you know, we're going to have a busy day the next day, we could cut  it short a little early, and, uh, you know, do it again.  Oh, good.  I can't wait.  And, uh, yeah, I can't either.  I think it'll be a lot of fun, Jill. 
[00:19:00]  Me too.  Is there anything else that you'd like me to signal to you?  I mean, I did an ear pull.  I think your improv is fantastic, and I, uh, I wouldn't want to taint that.  But in all fairness, we've got a lot of listeners now.  They want to see the secret message, so maybe you could give us what the secret message is  going to be for the next traffic report.  Oh, well, you have some already, right?  I believe that we sent them over to you, so they should be on...  Yeah.  No, but you've got to, like, announce it on the air, because I'm telling you, everyone's  going to turn off our show to watch your next traffic. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, is there going to be another one?  You're going to see a rating spike, but you've got to tell us what the message is ahead of  time.  Then they're going to see it and go, oh, my God, this is real.  I will keep texting Cece, and I'll give him all the details, and I'll think of something,  whether it's a touch, a pull, a tug, or a hello.  Maybe I could just do a general hello to Anthony, who lives out on Long Island.  Well, that would be nice.  I don't want to speak for Anthony, but I think he's home for a tug and a pull.  Hey, don't be...  Shut up!  You are just...  You are the destroyer. 
[00:20:00]  God, he's...  Are you getting a little shy?  Well, I work with very immature people.  Oh, okay.  And it's very difficult to...  It's time for me to go.  We have the top of the show.  He's calling us immature.  He plays video games with 12-year-olds all night long.  Okay, would you let Jill go?  She's working.  When's the next traffic?  Well, quickly, no, but then about 6...  What is it?  I guess 7-09-ish.  All right.  Our 7-09-ish, there will be a secret message to Anthony, but you've got to text Steve beforehand 
[00:20:30]  so we can tell everybody what that message is going to be.  Let's go.  Bye, Jill.  Bye.  Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.  Say goodbye to your girlfriend.  She's working.  Now she's going to pop on real quick.  I want to say goodbye to Yoko Ono.  Shut up!  Oh, Anthony's fair.  His glasses are asses.  That was good while it lasted.  She's going to be all happy and fun.  She likes Obama.  He'll be like, you know what?  I think he's all right.  Right, right. 
[00:21:00]  God.  You're a bit smitten there, my friend.  I'm just talking.  You know what?  Why can't we talk?  I'll step out of character.  You know, come on.  What?  She's beautiful.  She's a very attractive girl.  Yes, who's going to deny that?  Huh?  No one's going to deny that.  That kid thing was interesting, huh?  Look.  She's not on the phone anymore.  So, what do you really think of kids?  I know if she's on the air, she's not listening.  What do you really think of kids? 
[00:21:30]  Is she on the air?  Oh, no.  There she is in front of the camera.  I thought Linda Church would snitch.  You know, you have to, you know, say, yeah, yeah, I like that.  She has people listening for her.  They're going to blow it.  Yeah, what do you think?  Now I've got to help you out.  Are you dumb?  Oh, kids are great.  All that stuff she said, she didn't hear the show.  She got reports.  Yeah.  About the taping of the day and everything.  What are the rats?  There's a lot of rats out there.  I'm so naive. 
[00:22:00]  Let me say hi to Tommy in New York.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Hey, what's up there, Ro?  I feel like I just watched the World Trade Center crash for the second time.  Yeah, the whole show is going to be destroyed within an hour.  I'm going to go hang a red ribbon around my tree now for Anthony.  Yeah, way to pick a fun reference.  Way to keep it light.  Having a light, silly time.  Tsunami happening.  All right.  It's just a train wreck.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  After the break. 
[00:22:30]  After the break.  Thank you, Tim.  Everyone helping you out with your potential.  Oh, great.  Because that's what I want.  Your guys' help.  With your potential romance with Jill Nicolini.  We got Anthony compares having a kid like being attacked by bean pod people.  Did I say that?  Must have been in my youth.  And we got the Bill Shatner dating advice for you as you go on this date with Jill Nicolini.  Why not tonight or tomorrow?  She's got family things going on this weekend. 
[00:23:00]  She said you were busy, too.  Bad mistake.  Yeah.  Well, here it is.  By saying, look, I'm not going to call this weekend because I'm sure she has something to do.  That's implying that I had something to do and wasn't being rude.  No, here's what that is.  It comes off, and I understand.  It doesn't come off like that.  It comes off like, nah, she's busy, aren't you?  No, no.  It comes off as, look, I'll call you next week because I have stuff to do this weekend.  All right.  And I say you have stuff, I'm sure, with such short notice, that you have plans, which means I'm sure, with such short notice, I have plans. 
[00:23:30]  I don't, but are you hoping?  It comes off that way.  Are you hoping to squeeze her boobies?  Would you stop?  There's no reason for this.  There's no reason for this.  What?  For you to say stuff like that.  Oh.  Donna wants to know. 
[00:24:00]  You know how people screw things up, too.  Like her reports will get back to her and go, Anthony said, and we want something Opie said.  What?  They always get everybody wrong.  Are we reliving high school today?  Bob, Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Long time, first time.  Yes.  Quank, quank.  You know what I kind of feel like?  I kind of feel like we're all dating Jill Nicolette.  Everyone's involved now. 
[00:24:30]  It's just like the sweetest thing until the knucklehead screws it up.  But it's a lot of fun.  Knucklehead?  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Between 10 and 2.  That's funny.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, this one goes out to Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, does it?  I really didn't pick up on that.  Oh, wait.  Yeah, this is one of the normal ones.  I didn't even catch that.  Man, he's got it.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, the next secret message Jill's going to be doing for you, Ant, is the goose step.  Oh, cool.  So we're going to be watching for that.  Sigheil salute.  She just did an okay terrific, although she kind of messed it up, but that was for you.  She just did it about two minutes ago.  She has to do it that way, though.  Yeah.  There are people saying that Channel 11 is syndicated, so they're watching the traffic all over the country now. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, really?  Thank you for the secret messages to you, my friend.  Bert and Philly.  Anthony plus Nicolini equals Antolini.  Antolini.  You know what that is, right?  What?  Think, think, think.  Well, Antolini was from The Godfather.  Yeah.  Antolini.  Okay, well, that's what they were getting into.  The real name of the Corleone family.  This is meant to be, Bert and Philly is saying. 
[00:26:00]  And Spike in New Hampshire.  How long before sitting in the car in the driveway?  How long before Anthony's sitting in the car in the driveway looking at the lit candles through the windows?  Somebody had a very funny line on Palton.  Yeah.  Did they?  They said they said, Anthony, just don't cry in front of her.  Which is really funny.  Oh, yeah.  That was actually Josh from Atlanta on the phone that we were going to go to.  Yeah, Josh.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Jumping the gun.  I'm sorry.  Jimmy stole your line, Josh. 
[00:26:30]  I apologize, dude.  I didn't realize that.  Josh, what's up?  Hey, no, that's fine, Jimmy.  You just go ahead and talk.  I'll sit here.  I'll accept that.  No, I'm sorry, dude.  We all laughed about it in the break, but I didn't realize it was up on the phone screen or thing.  Yeah.  I'm sorry, Josh.  All right.  No, that's okay, Jimmy.  I love you.  What were you going to say?  Just say it.  I don't want to steal it.  Just say it.  What I was going to say, Anthony, is when you take her out, if it's raining and you happen  to get a flat tire, please don't sit in the car crying. 
[00:27:00]  Cry at a flat tire?  I know.  So you meant something like, you know, sitting watching the movie Ghost.  Sure.  You can't start weeping openly.  Would that turn a girl off on the first date?  If, like, you were going to the restaurant, but you pulled off, like, into, like, a residential  area and you parked somewhere dark and you turned the car off, and she's like, what  are you doing?  If you had both hands on the wheel and you just looked at her with tears on your face  and went, so beautiful.  Oh, God damn.  Oh, how creepy.  Wow. 
[00:27:30]  Just bawling.  Crying so hard, you had, like, that white thing, that white piece of spit from top lip  to lower lip with your mouth wide open.  Just snot running down your nose and spit bubbles.  Steve got a message from her that she was going to work in a OK Terrific during her  traffic report, and this is how it went down.  All right.  Checking with our trains.  Everything is running on time.  L-I-R-R, New Jersey Transit, Metro North.  Okay.  That's terrific, isn't it?  Alternate sides are in effect today citywide.  Unfortunately, not so terrific is the weather, right, Linda? 
[00:28:00]  No, it's certainly...  OK Terrific.  Yeah, she was attempting a OK Terrific for you.  She's probably figuring, how do I get the words OK Terrific out, like, on a news show?  Yeah, yeah.  Where it makes any kind of sense.  You had to put the vaccine.  Yeah.  It works.  Sure.  Let's say hi to Mike in Babylon.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, uh, Murphy, how long do you think it is before, uh, Jill says something like those  whiskers are a little rough and Anthony comes in completely clean shaven?  Well, he's already changing right in front of our eyes because he had a different take 
[00:28:30]  on kids.  He's been bitching and complaining about kids forever.  Did I?  And on the phone, uh, we're getting that audio, on the phone with Jill, you had a different  take on kids.  I really didn't realize it was any more of a different take than, uh, than I've had  in the past.  Well, I got two examples of you talking about kids that we're going to compare to what you  said about kids today.  You need evidence?  All right.  Get that out of there, you jackass.  You suck.  That's you?  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Clean shaved. 
[00:29:00]  Ugh.  Where is that?  I don't know.  That was a while ago.  It's not the wrong with you, clean shaved.  Yeah, right.  All right.  You leave that up there one more second.  I'm going to punch you in the face.  That was a nice smile.  Someone was happy that day.  Shut it.  Uh, Bill Shatner called the show yesterday.  Yeah.  And he pretty much blew off talking about his, uh, his book to give you dating advice.  Great.  As, uh, we all patiently wait for the big day.  You going out with Jill Nicolini.  This is what Bill Shatner had to say. 
[00:29:30]  We got to excuse Anthony.  He fell in love, uh, today.  And, uh, he's a little distracted.  So, uh.  Jesus.  He fell in love today?  Yeah.  When they, uh.  When I woke up on the elevator, he saw the one.  Uh, and I came over with a direct quote.  And I said, Anthony, Jill Nicolini wants you to know two things.  She is A, available.  And B, interested.  Wow.  And, uh, they got her on the horn and we set up a little, uh, love connection.  Live.  Live.  She's hot.  Yes. 
[00:30:00]  Exactly.  You didn't think of me in that moment?  I don't know.  What do you think, Bill?  Uh, how do I handle something like that?  I think you've handled it exactly right.  Well, what does it say about Anthony when getting a date with Jill Nicolini is the second best thing that happens to him on the show?  Hey, you know, I, I have my priorities.  I have to, I'll have to tune into Channel 11 and take a look at what, uh, your next date.  Yes, certainly.  Where are you going to go?  Certainly will.  I think there's a nice place, uh, around. 
[00:30:30]  What do you think of this, Bill?  I, I, I suggested a nice restaurant that's kind of near my house.  Because we both live on Long Island.  Oh, really?  Uh, but Long Island is long.  It's an island that's long.  Yeah, but, but, uh, it's close enough.  We're within proximity of each other there.  So I suggest something near the house and then.  That's so good.  And we'll go out and then, and then, hey, how about, you know, I show you, uh, because I'm having some work done on the house, having a pool put in the back.  Uh-huh.  And, you know.  And here's the side benefit of all that. 
[00:31:00]  You can go on a date and the weather will be nice.  See?  Yeah.  When should we go?  Well, let's see.  The sun will be out, uh, on Thursday.  So let's go and sit outside and dine al fresco.  Yeah.  A little advice from Bill Shatner, Ian.  Yes.  Right.  Now, um, we got what you said about kids today.  Uh-huh.  We got two examples, two.  I mean, we could have pulled ten.  Yeah.  Uh, how about we, we start with what you have said about kids in the past? 
[00:31:30]  Uh, I don't think it's any, why not just play what I said just before?  Because I don't, there's no real difference.  Why not just read what he's been charged with?  In the past, you said this about kids.  I have nothing to say to kids.  I don't know how to talk to them.  What do you say?  They come up and show you something.  Uh, Uncle Anthony, look at the, oh, neat.  Get out of here.  I don't remember saying that. 
[00:32:00]  And that's sad because, uh, your brother, uh, became a father yesterday.  See, I said, we haven't told this.  That's neat.  We haven't told this side of the show, by the way.  Uh, brother Joe is now a father.  He's a daddy.  And, uh, you're now an uncle.  Yeah.  I'm an uncle.  For whatever that means, you know.  It's a good thing.  I don't feel any different.  You also said this about, uh, kids in the past.  Here's what it is.  I've got it.  Okay.  Having a baby seems to be like when you fell asleep next to the bean pod in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
[00:32:30]  When, before it happens, you're fighting it tooth and nail.  You hate it.  You look at the people that have changed and go, oh my God, look at him.  He's pointing out everybody.  What is he doing?  I don't want to live this life of, of post-bean pod.  And, and you fight it tooth and nail.  And, and the bean pod people look evil and horrible and nasty.  And it's a terrible way to go through life.  There's, there's no, uh, you're, you're lacking some of the things that you would have had, uh, prior to the bean pods. 
[00:33:00]  Pre-pod.  Then you go to sleep next to the pod.  You wake up and all of a sudden, you're one of them.  Everything's fine.  You're not sad.  You don't miss what you had because you're really, you're in another phase of, of your, your life.  Yeah.  I don't want to fall asleep next to the bean pod ever.  I like pre-bean pod.  So, you know, I, I said that.  Yeah.  You make it very obvious. 
[00:33:30]  Just moments ago, we had Jill Nicolini on the phone.  And this is what you had to say about, uh, kids today.  Yeah.  Do you or do you don't want kids, Anthony?  You know, uh, people know me off the air as really loving children.  Oh my God, what is up?  I, uh, I have a very, a soft spot, uh, for kids.  Um, yeah, I, I, I love kids.  The more, the merrier, I say.  She's going to ruin them.  Oh yeah.  You are done. 
[00:34:00]  Done, my friend.  More, the merrier.  So five is okay with you.  Five is, uh, good.  If, if that's, if that's enough for you, I mean, five is fine.  Help me out here, Henry.  Wait till this makes the papers.  Probably as soon as tomorrow, by the way.  Oh no.  This whole thing is, uh, taking on a life of its own, my friend.  Let's say hi to, uh, Mike in Jersey. 
[00:34:30]  Mike, what's up?  Anthony.  Yeah.  I know it's, I know it's supercar weekend, but could you please pick up a case of long,  thin maxis with wings?  Yes, Kevin.  Hey boys, what's happening?  Hey.  Uh, want to know if Anthony's going to park the car and give her the old, what are we going  to do with this?  Hey, good lucker!  Uh, Jay Moore's strategy.  What are we going to do with this?  When you just park the car, you, uh, expose everything and just go, what are we going to do about this? 
[00:35:00]  One of the greatest Jay Moore moments on our show ever.  Uh, Marine Joe, New York, what's up?  Hey guys, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony, in all seriousness, man, a couple days ago you were talking about sometimes you're  wondering what the end game is and you don't know what, what, uh, it's going to be at the  end of the road.  Well, I think you've got your answer now, buddy.  See, no, no reason to be depressed anymore, my friend.  Why do you think I said that on the air?  Makes people go like, aw.  Aw, maybe he needs a little company.  Let's go to Frank in New York. 
[00:35:30]  Frank.  Hey, okay, I got, I got a, I got a great signal that you can get to Anthony on the air.  Okay.  Basically, basically a tongue on the inside of her cheek with her hands going back and forth  toward her face.  We kind of made that same joke in the office.  They're like, it's going to get to the point where these, uh, the secret messages are going  to get obnoxious.  Very good, Frank.  Uh, let's see how to build the trucker.  Bill.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, Ann.  I think, uh, Joe Michelini's a size queen because she heard about that luscious house. 
[00:36:00]  Why?  Why?  Hey, we did you.  Why does it have to go there?  We did you a service by, uh, you know, telling everyone about what you've got going on.  Thanks, Ann.  I got to live up to it.  That's right.  You do.  Just set up a mirror in the bed.  Ah, you go right ahead, sir.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to try to participate.  We didn't know it was Bill the Truckers, man.  So, go right ahead, Bill.  Sorry.  Participating in.  Yeah, sorry, Bill.  Yes, Bill.  What? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, boy.  Ah, let's go to Jimmy in East Meadow.  Jimmy.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, uh, Ann, maybe you can, uh, take you to a, uh, No Doubt concert.  Needy.  Wow, that, that, that wouldn't be a good thing.  No.  Uh, let's say how to Clint in Utah.  Clint.  Anthony, your biological clock is obviously ticking, man, with Brother Joe having a kid.  Oh, you think that's it with my brother having one?  My sister is having one? 
[00:37:00]  Yep.  And, uh...  Yeah, man, East Side Days, it's Anthony's next.  The clock's ticking, Anthony.  You're done, man.  The clock's ticking, all right.  Well, uh, are we sending this next song out to Keith the Cop?  Keith, pack your stuff.  Get the hell out.  You're leaving the Cumia compound.  Like, obviously, you know, there's nothing going on with you and Keith, but it's going 
[00:37:30]  to look a little creepy when you give her the tour of the house and go, oh, well, this  is where Keith's room.  She's going to ask too many questions.  Get them out now.  He demanded on the sound system.  Yeah.  Because they have a sound system where you have this remote and you're able to turn on music  in each individual room in the house.  It could be a different song playing in every room or the same song playing in the whole  house.  It could adjust the volumes up and down in each individual rooms or the whole package  link rooms together.  But he wanted his on this remote control labeled Keith's Suite. 
[00:38:00]  And he told the people that installed it to do that and they did it.  So now one of the bedrooms actually is labeled as Keith's Suite on it.  And I think that's going to have to be changed.  When Jill gets to tour of the house, she'll probably look at all the pillows and wonder  whether they have like teeth marks in them.  There's no teeth marks in the pillows.  When is the mansion going to be called Jill's house?  I can't wait until she owns it.  Oh, shut up! 
[00:38:30]  He's going to be ruined.  Get out of here.  This ends with Anthony in a tiny, tiny little apartment in Brentwood.  Knockington.  Yeah, just back at Apollo air conditioning in Brentwood.  Yeah.  Ah, very nice.  Well, you're getting some good feedback here from Jack in Long Beach.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  I just wanted to say, I don't think it's very fair how Anthony's being depleted right now.  All right, yes.  You guys are making him out to be a real female. 
[00:39:00]  He's a man's man.  I mean, cars and guns, he can handle a hot chick.  Thank you, sir.  Finally, a reasonable man on the phone.  That's the only thing that's missing.  You got the guns, the fast cars.  Now you just need the hot chick.  Yeah.  You guys got me weeping openly.  You got me getting my house taken away from me.  Oh, well, you know.  Thank you, Jack.  Awful me from Whackbag writes, I think her last signal was for Ant to steal third. 
[00:39:30]  Very funny.  Ah, wow.  Jeff, Atlanta, this is all they want to talk about is you and Jill Nicolini.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  Anthony, you need to ask her mom if she can make left-hand turns.  That should be a prerequisite.  It really should.  The mothers have to be able to make left-hand turns.  I can't wait until Jill's family comes in from out of town and they want to stay at  Anthony's place.  Oh, it's going to be, this is going to be fantastic.  What?  Look at Jimmy's just basking in this.  Yeah, I'm happy for you.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Or maybe I'll have to fly halfway across the country to see her family.  Oh, that's right.  That was you.  Where?  All the way across the country.  Yeah.  Oh, it was all the way.  All the way.  Sorry.  Damn, I screwed that up.  That's all right.  I tried to jab him and I did nothing.  That's all right.  It was actually true.  I did fly across the country.  You did?  Yeah, well.  How was that?  Better than having him over.  All right, we've got to take another break.  We're going to keep this on the back burner. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, are we?  Oh, yeah.  I thought it would just go away.  There's seven phone lines lit for this.  I know.  People can't stop commenting.  We just need a little time to get more audio on the air.  The audio caught up and, you know, waiting for the next secret message from Jill to you.  Does Steve know what the next one's going to be yet?  No?  All right.  Kevin the trucker.  We can't screen the calls fast enough.  Kevin, what's up? 
[00:41:00]  Hey, buddy.  I just wanted to ask Anthony.  How many years is it going to be before he's sitting around here screaming because she's  taking 28% of his paycheck for those five kids she wants?  Mike in Tennessee.  Mike?  Yeah, I just wanted to ask Anthony.  Ain't she just a little too old for you?  Ant, comment?  No, not at all.  Why would you even say something like that? 
[00:41:30]  Let's see.  Ant, do you need to play poker this weekend?  And I was thinking of going antiquing.  That's some comic genius on Tal Talk.  I don't really go antiquing.  And Jill doesn't seem like the type of poker that goes antiquing.  Todd in Pennsylvania.  Todd?  Yeah, I was just wondering how Anthony's going to cross that emotional hurdle of unleashing  his magnificent hog.  You know, Todd, I'm beside myself here. 
[00:42:00]  I just can't.  How will you be presenting the goodness?  Shut up.  There's no presentation.  You can't just flop it.  You've got to flop it.  There's got to be a presentation of the goodness.  Could you stop?  I bet I know how Anthony, when he first shows anyone, he probably just unbuckles the belt.  Like, he undoes it, and then he just kind of lets his pants shimmy naturally down.  The damn thing takes on a life of its own. 
[00:42:30]  Just the way it presents itself there, and he just probably, like, looks down like there's  nothing that needs to be said here.  God damn.  Am I going to have to take her to the premiere of Sex and the City?  You know what's going to suck?  You know what's going to suck?  If this becomes a real relationship, man, we're going to have a lot of apologizing to do.  You are.  I mean, I'm polite.  Don't we.  Charlie, Philly, what's up? 
[00:43:00]  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Anthony, you're going to be just like Rich Voss, 50 years old, having kids.  Wow, yeah.  Not.  Yes.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, man?  I just wanted to know if you took care of business last night thinking about Jill Nicolini.  That's a good question.  All right.  I don't think this conversation is, I don't think we have to get into things like this  when there hasn't even been a one-on-one phone call yet.  I mean, really. 
[00:43:30]  I got to tell you, me and my friends had this thing when we were kids.  If you took care of business with that particular one woman you were thinking about, it would  never work out.  I disagree.  I think it's just the opposite.  I really do.  You think so?  Yeah, man.  Good luck, pal.  If you don't have any kind of a, yeah, falling in love with a beautiful girl is easy, but  if you fall in lust and love, that's good.  It's healthy.  Oh, I could see Ann holding her purse as she shops for onesies for the baby.  What's a onesie?  You don't know what a onesie is?  No. 
[00:44:00]  It's kind of like a, it's a onesie.  Oh, it's just that one thing that babies wear?  It's the clothes, yeah.  Stupid baby clothes.  How did we ever get out of wearing those?  I'd like to wear one of those one day.  No kidding.  Come in in a onesie.  A onesie.  I thought that's how much sleep E-Rock got last night.  Oh!  Let's have onesie day.  We all come in wearing a onesie.  I have Anthony presenting music when he presents the goodness.  All right, let's see if E-Rock's awake.  It's fanfare for the common man. 
[00:44:30]  There's a waist-high spotlight.  You've got to stop it.  Oh, my God.  It's so goddamn embarrassing to be with you people.  There it was.  Is that the moment?  Yes, it was, my son.  Oh, great.  That's the sound that makes me hit the floor.  Yeah.  All right, just got to roll it back up. 
[00:45:00]  Lighting changes.  Sure.  Great.  Keith in the background crying.  Lasers.  A little fanballing.  Fanballing.  Who?  I got to say this. 
[00:45:30]  No, you don't.  I thought it was a bit until we took the Jill phone call today.  Really?  I was hoping that we would get the asking out on the date thing on our show.  No, that's not.  And she's like, no, that will happen in private.  That's going to be.  That's going to be.  It calls me.  What am I going to do, make plans and tell where we're going so all the fans can show up?  They wouldn't.  No, but.  Oh, of course they wouldn't.  Someone's suggesting you present the goodness with ecstasy of gold play.  Oh, well. 
[00:46:00]  I feel like I have to go to work.  He told me a movie that I liked him.  Whip him out Wednesday.  Jimmy, comment?  Oh, yeah.  I'm very happy.  Oh, and by the way, they're real?  In this big package.  All sports all the time.  No excuses.  Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Advil.  No more need to search all over the dial for sports.  You've found it.  Dan Patrick is back in Las Vegas at 9.  Sports Radio 1140 KSFN. 
[00:46:30]  Okay, here we go.  Hey, this is Brett Michaels of Poison, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess somewhere around 4, 4.30 in the morning, we all got text messages and emails from Anthony.  A besotted Anthony Cumia.  I'll tell you this much.  He was still on his date at 4, 4.30 in the morning.  I didn't know many of your golf in South Hall stayed open that late.  And I got unbelievable text messages. 
[00:47:00]  Let's start the bidding at $1.  $1, $1, $1, $1, $1.  I think yours are better than mine.  I got one text.  And I'll read it.  It's not...  I could so blow up his spot right now.  I got four text messages that will destroy him.  Right here, my friends.  Well, just the idea that FruitFly was texting me on his date.  Like he's Charlotte from Sex and the City.  That in itself blows up his spot, in my opinion. 
[00:47:30]  Well, oh, my God, I can't believe it.  Let's just put it this way.  OMG, Anthony.  Let's just put it this way.  Anthony, the first text from Anthony was when she decided to, like, freshen up and go to the bathroom.  And Anthony decided he needed to text me.  Oh, you got a text from Jill?  Yeah.  All right, Steve's got a text from Jill Nicolini, who, by the way, also called in sick today.  The traffic vixen is not on Channel 11 this morning.  And the shock jock is not on his radio show this morning. 
[00:48:00]  He's probably holding her hostage.  I'm going to read this one with some blanks in it.  Okay.  So mine came in at 9 o'clock.  We're blanking like animals right at the table.  She just went to the ladies' room.  The grandma?  She's a blank.  Wow.  Wait, hold on.  Fill in the blanks yourself.  I know.  Have fun filling in the blanks.  Wait.  Holy crap. 
[00:48:30]  We're arm wrestling at the table.  And Adam, like crazy, she's a man.  Steve, and then you got one at what?  I got one at 9.37 p.m. from Jill that reads,  Hi, Steve.  Might take off tomorrow.  Ann and I having an incredible time.  Don't expect him in tomorrow.  Smiley face.  Smiley face.  All right.  And then after that, I got a text.  I don't even know if I can read these three.  Dude, this is some serious blank. 
[00:49:00]  I'm going blank to blank blank in my pants.  I don't know if either of us will be in tomorrow.  If she's not on and I'm not in, it will make for ridiculous radio.  I think I can say that.  And then it continues.  We are so blanking tonight.  That can mean anything.  Yeah.  I'll try to make it.  I'm in. 
[00:49:30]  Wow.  I'm in blank.  So it's close.  I just may be late, but I'll try to suck it up.  And get there on time.  History in the making.  She's.  Wow.  Really?  She's.  History in the making.  What?  Two dumb Italians meeting and fornicating like leavens?  What an event.  Mark this day in your calendar. 
[00:50:00]  I'm sure Anthony likes some of his privacy, so I cannot read the rest of that final text.  Oh, that's funny.  At a later date.  Let's just put it that way.  So what?  What time was that?  That's a good question.  The last one.  I don't know because there's a, there's, there's at least six hours that we had no communication  with Anthony.  Oh, wow.  At least six.  My last text came in at, that he sent me at 10, 10 o'clock.  Maybe 11 o'clock because I never changed my phone. 
[00:50:30]  Okay.  So I think it's 11 o'clock actually.  So he possibly had a drink by then.  Yeah, very possibly.  You think Anthony could just go out and have a, one glass of wine and a little, little steak  and go home by 10, 11 o'clock.  What do you got there, Steve?  And I have one in addition to what you have in front of you.  I have a 424 AM text message that says not coming in.  Jill says hi.  Ooh.  But it's brazen. 
[00:51:00]  What do you think that means?  They're, they're insane.  This is, this is, uh, she's going to ruin them.  You know that, right?  He's finished.  He's, he's so finished.  For her, it's probably like one good fun story.  Like, you know, he really, he's in love.  She's just, she's using him as a dumb notch in her belt.  You know, like, you know, the voice guy from Opie and Anthony.  Well, the father was rattling off all the guys she went out with yesterday, right?  There was hockey players.  There were what?  There were actors. 
[00:51:30]  Jill.  Her dad called in.  Yeah.  Oh, that was after you left.  Did you hear the dad phone call?  No.  Do we have the dad?  We got to get all this stuff for Colin because Colin was right in the middle of this yesterday.  Uh, I was just talking about my daughter.  Dude, his name is Anthony.  Anthony.  Oh, no.  That's weird.  No, listen to this.  Uh, Jill's grandfather, Anthony.  Jill's father, Anthony.  Jill's brother, Anthony.  Uh, Jill's nephew, Anthony.  Now Jill's stalker, Anthony. 
[00:52:00]  And, and Jill's father called in.  Yeah.  And, uh, he likes to be called Speedo Man.  He can't wait to go for a swim at Anthony's house when the pool's, uh, done.  Oh.  And, uh, what else did he say?  Oh, he just started rattling off all the guys that Jill has gone out with.  Not actual names, but what they do.  Hockey players, actors, Wall Street guys, regular guys.  Yeah, it's quite a list.  Yeah.  It was, uh, quite a list.  Very impressive.  I mean, they're all, uh, obviously guys that make money.  She's, she shouldn't date broke guys.  She probably didn't talk like guys that, theater acts that work, uh, in his club. 
[00:52:30]  Well, you know what?  No, this is probably.  That kind of big.  It's probably like a scavenger hunt, and she just didn't have radio hosts.  That was it.  It's like a bachelorette party.  Yeah.  Just, uh, checking them off as I go.  Let's say hi to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, Paul.  I got a text from Anthony, too.  It says, my blank accidentally went off.  How do I clean up all this blank off the walls of the pool?  Nice.  Thank you.  Colin, you're killing it, Colin.  How's it going?  Oh, man. 
[00:53:00]  I guess everyone's going to be calling with their text messages that they got from Anthony.  Oh, is that a good one?  God, Anthony couldn't keep it to himself.  He's just texting like crazy every moment he got, every chance he got.  Uh, Coke Logic came up with this, uh, overnight.  This whole thing taking on a life of its own.  To the point now they're not even doing their jobs anymore.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Look at this thing on Channel 11 instead of Jill Nicolini today.  Because she called in sick as well.  Uh, Coke Logic.  What happens in Long Island?  Anthony Cuglia is a radio nerd. 
[00:53:30]  He thought he had it all.  Fucking guns, whores, gay guys.  It was insane.  Until one day, she could stun this shock job with a message.  I come up with a message for Anthony.  Oh, from Jill?  She said she is A, single, and B, interested.  Sent from a traffic girl.  They probably network in Nicolini.  With Giant King.  I'm actually single.  Why can't I get him?  I'm calling to, um, ask if maybe Anthony wants to go out. 
[00:54:00]  Now Anthony's on cloud now.  My pal Anthony is deeply in love with Jill Nicolini.  He's changing his way.  I've been hearing that you're having a hard time with children these days.  And he's ready to betray his beliefs for a piece of ass.  Uh, people know me off the air as really loving children.  I have a very, uh, soft spot for kids.  Yeah, I, I, I love kids.  The more the merrier.  Anthony Cuglia. 
[00:54:30]  Can I point out how great it is that this whole time Anthony was just trying to wrap it up before one of us wrecked it down?  Jill Nicolini.  Also debris spill.  Lots of delays here.  Taking out the left lane.  Traffic is definitely going to linger longer.  And Keith the Cop is the jilted lover.  Another disgruntled employee.  I forgot.  All disgruntled.  The disgruntled ONA Pictures presents  What Happens in Long Island  Stays in Long Island  Coming to a theater  Oh, man. 
[00:55:00]  We needed Anthony here today that, uh, you know, so we could kill him.  Hopefully we can get him on the phone at least.  You think that's going to happen?  No.  I think he's in crash mode by now.  Yeah.  He doesn't have it.  You got him on the phone?  Yeah, well, yeah, of course try to get him on the phone.  Oh, yeah, I don't think he's coming in.  That's great.  One more minute before we get Jill's, uh...  Yeah, it's a ten minute call, but it's fabulous.  All right, we can do it after the break.  Yeah, the father called in and, uh, it was actually, uh, Ant was pretty good with him. 
[00:55:30]  He handled it well.  He didn't panic.  But he really was worried that we were going to blow it and say something stupid.  Of course.  He really is in love and she, like you said,  this relationship has the connection of, like, you know, Scarface and Michelle Pfeiffer.  He's like, you like kids?  She's like, I don't know, I guess if there's a nanny.  I want to have a lot of kids.  He's going to be hearing her.  Oh.  What a heartbreaker.  Yeah, I think she'll ruin him in a second.  Yeah, this is a little different.  He's texting her like, there's a backup on my heart.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  Traffic girl.  I had a five-car pileup in the left lane of my love.  Do you know where they went for dinner?  No, uh, he actually did tell me where they were going and what time.  I forget, though, which doesn't help at all.  I think it was, yeah, it was the Ruby Tuesdays in, uh, in Bohemia, I think.  In Icelandia.  Icelandia.  Some fancy place.  You know, some place around, I think, where she lived.  Correction, some place that he thinks is fancy.  Yeah, you're probably right.  He thinks it's fancy, but, like, the trendy New Yorkers would be like, oh, no, that's 
[00:56:30]  from 1998.  Yeah.  It's probably the big thing is they bring you all the bread you want.  You don't even have to ask them.  And they both comment, this is good bread, though.  Yeah, it's warm.  I find a lot of places, you know, the bread's hard.  Let's say hi to Rob on, uh, well, actually, from Rhode Island.  Rob, what's up?  How much, boys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Isn't Jill too big and too old for Anthony?  Well, that's what's weird about this, because Anthony has gone, uh, a bit younger than Jill. 
[00:57:00]  Really?  How big is she?  Not that Jill's old, but Jill's 30.  That's, that's, that's old for Anthony.  Yeah.  And how big is she?  What do you mean big?  He, this kid said, isn't she too big for him?  He probably means adult, grown-up-wise.  I think he means also big, like, no, no, she's beefy.  She's a tiny little thing with, uh, with, with two giant things up here.  Yes.  Very chesty gal.  Extremely chesty.  Do you have a picture of Jill for Colin?  You know, you haven't seen a picture of Jill yet?  I've seen her on the news, and I've seen her in, uh, Playboy Images, but I wasn't sure 
[00:57:30]  if that was her.  It was one of your fans that, uh, put it up there.  I wasn't sure if he was giving people the business.  When do we get to sit down from Anthony?  Yeah.  Where, where he goes, uh, guys, uh, you know, it's been fun, and it was a good radio bit,  but, you know, she's my, she's my girl.  Yeah.  You know, we really can't talk about this anymore on the air and stuff.  It's a, it's kind of real and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  It's because she's going to be like the Long Island Yoko.  You got to tell Opie to lay off.  You're the one that does the voices. 
[00:58:00]  And, uh, yeah, well, certain things we can't do anymore on the show because she doesn't like it.  Yeah.  Nothing to do with sex.  Yeah, nothing to do with sex and, you know, stop slamming the Democrats.  That guy, Jim's disgust.  Yeah, he does go over the line, honey, as far as sex, but a lot of it's made up, but some  of it's true, exactly, and that's what I find offensive.  This is what we're doing.  Uh, we're just warming up, getting the show together.  Uh, no Anthony today.  The date went very well with, uh, Jill Nicolini, the traffic vixen from Channel 11 here in New  York City. 
[00:58:30]  Uh, after the break, I want to thank Colin.  We woke him up to just come in here and help us out today.  Uh, we got Jill's dad calling into the show.  You got to hear this.  You got to hear this one.  We'll do that next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Wow.  Awesome dude, bitch.  For the people out there, uh, whipping my Wednesday, you know the deal, I hope.  Get a wow sticker, get splashed, get happy.  The color of Christ compels you!  This is Sports Radio 1140 KSFN.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan. 
[00:59:00]  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Uh, we just woke up Jill's dad.  Oh, no.  Jill's dad will be calling the show, uh, within 15 or 20 minutes.  Uh, we're going to give him the news that, uh, it looks like Jill never went home last night.  Or, uh, actually I'm thinking Ant never went home last night.  I think she's, I think she's, uh, the leader in that, uh. 
[00:59:30]  She didn't need to see the Luftwaffe, uh, you know, wall paintings on the first date.  Uh, we got a phone call from Anthony.  Mm.  Anthony went out with the, the lovely Jill Nicolini last night and he called in sick and, uh, Jill called in sick.  And this is what, this is the only thing we got from Anthony so far.  Hi, Steve.  I'm really sick.  Um, I'm not going to be able to make it in today.  Uh, I don't know if, like, Hope wants to do the show with Jimmy. 
[01:00:00]  But I'm really ill.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, I don't think I'm going to make it in.  Um, yeah, give me a call if you have any questions.  But, uh, I don't know if they want to do the show.  That's, that's okay.  It's not.  We're on a best of, but, um, yeah, I'm really sick.  I think I got, like, a 24-hour bug.  What? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I'm throwing up.  Yeah, I'm throwing up and stuff.  That's good.  Uh, so I don't think I'm going to make it in.  All right.  Bye.  Okay.  Was that really him today?  Yeah.  He sounded like a flaming homosex.  He did, right?  I was going to say that.  Yeah.  I didn't want to blow up his spot, but.  Wow.  What is, what is she doing to him?  Yeah, something, like, uh, what's his name in Sopranos?  Yeah.  I'm really sick.  Did you hear her coaching him in the background? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I heard a, I heard a voice in the background.  And I'm really, I'm so terrible, and I can't commit.  Yeah.  I like the fact that he tries to act like he cares.  I mean, if they want to put on Best Of, you're not the program director.  Just shut up and admit you're not in.  Yeah.  If they want to put on Best Of, I'll do the show without me.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Stop giving the obvious options.  Yeah.  He listed the only two things we could do.  That was just not a helpful suggestion.  Yeah.  Thanks for your help.  Yeah.  Listen to the two, two options.  And then he goes, uh, tell us, you can call me if you have any questions. 
[01:01:30]  All right.  Well, we have a few questions.  Yeah.  We do have a few questions.  I'm trying to call you.  Get him on the phone.  And, uh, because of that, we got this now.  And now for an update on Anthelini Gate 08.  The two apparently went on a hot Long Island date last night that was so steamy, it kept  them away from work this morning.  After Anthony left a series of text messages for his coworkers, we can only speculate on 
[01:02:00]  exactly what went on last night.  But what we can say is that there was a whole lot of blanking going on.  Dude, this is some serious blank.  I'm, uh, I'm going blank to blank, blank.  We'll keep you updated as the Anthelini saga continues. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  On a Tuesday.  On a Tuesday.  But I don't, here's my favorite part, is them thinking they're being funny.  Oh, I'm really sick.  And they're, like, laughing.  Obviously, we're joking with you guys.  I'm not sick.  And it's like, oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah, and he's got, like, that slow, awful cadence.  Like, yeah, that satisfied cat.  Idiot.  So, uh, we'll have Jill's father on the show in a, in a, in a few minutes here. 
[01:03:00]  Let's say hi to John in D.C.  John.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, John.  Oh, please don't do an impression.  It's this morning.  I don't need to be drunk before I go to work.  Did I do an impression?  The drinking game?  Yeah, no, he knows, but he's saying.  I know.  What impression did I do?  No, please don't.  I don't need to be drunk before work.  What do you mean, sir?  Ah.  Thank you, sir.  Quick, use that one button, you hack. 
[01:03:30]  Even the buttons are a hack.  Use a different one once in a while.  Sweep it up a little.  All right, this is how you make me feel.  Now, that's funny.  How's that one?  Is that true?  Yeah.  Is that true?  I just got that message.  This is how you make me feel.  Oh, my God.  This is how you make me feel.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Well, breaking news.  Well, Rush and Malloy, they write the gossip column for the Daily News,  and they had a little piece on the Anthony, Jill, Nicolini thing yesterday. 
[01:04:00]  Just wrote Coach Mike with this.  Anthony better watch out.  I heard that the hockey player she went out with ended up with his Johnson crazy glued to his thigh.  What did Anthony get himself?  I love her even more now.  I know.  Especially knowing Anthony's Johnson.  She's probably got, like, a paint roller with glue on it.  Oh, is that a monster?  Oh, yeah.  It's awful.  Well, yeah, we're speculating that.  It's got to be just ridiculous. 
[01:04:30]  Once again, get rid of that stupid IM screen, please.  Thank you.  Anthony better watch out.  I heard that the hockey player she went out with ended up with his Johnson crazy glued to his thigh.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Yeah, something is not right here.  Yeah.  I really hope that Anthony has something unpleasant happening to him.  As much as I love Anthony, but I'm jealous.  You think he's, like, just nude and chained to a wall somewhere?  We got to go find him now?  Yeah.  Yeah, she probably put on that special belt that real submissives like. 
[01:05:00]  And, you know, they gave him the business with his face in the video.  And old pillowbiter Anthony.  Well, we predicted this yesterday on the show.  I said this.  Are we taking tomorrow off?  Why would we take tomorrow off?  Well, the only thing we've never been known to indulge a little too much?  A little drink?  You were supposed to, were you hoping for us to, like, support you on that? 
[01:05:30]  No.  You're right, Anthony.  You've never done that before.  Oh, that was yesterday.  Of course he was going to take today off.  We knew that.  Yeah.  I'm just bummed that I got a massive allergy attack happening.  Yeah.  All this amazing stuff is going on.  Oh, we have to hear about what this, what happened.  How can he not pick up the phone?  Maybe he's just, he's, are you kidding me?  She wrecked him.  You think they're banging?  Yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Colin?  Yeah, maybe.  Either that or they're playing, like, I don't know, like, some kind of board game.  Well, maybe the hockey player came over, he didn't get glued, and he's just like a psychopath.  And right now, Anthony's being checked into, like, a high-rise window in Long Island City.  Just getting checked into every wall.  Yeah, he looks like a, he looks like a bug smashed against the window.  And she's like, get off, get off, I'm serious.  Oh, God.  I just don't think this is going to end well.  Now, let's say hi to Rich in the Bronx. 
[01:06:30]  Rich.  Yo, what's going on, y'all?  Hey, buddy.  Y'all are terrible.  How y'all going to hate on the man?  He's got a nice little sweet piece there.  He's having a good time.  Y'all just destroying him.  Y'all are terrible.  No, we're not destroying him, but we want to know what happened.  He kind of teased everybody.  He leaves a message.  He doesn't tell us what's going on, and he doesn't come in.  We want to hear.  It's like, how do you leave a setup like that with no conclusion?  And we warned him yesterday that he better get his ass in here, or it's going to just  be us piling on and making fun of him, and he's not going to be able to defend himself. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  And that's exactly what's going on today.  Oh, look.  That new traffic girl's doing a great job, too.  Look at that traffic.  I bet Jill misses.  She's not in the middle of that.  Look at that thing.  Yeah, look at that.  Let's say hi to Kevin the Trucker.  Kevin.  Hey, Hope.  Hey, E.  Hello, sir.  Hey, you've been teasing us for the last two weeks, and somebody's leaving the show at the  end of the month, now we know who it is.  It's Anthony, you think?  I think so.  I think he's in Vegas right now, probably getting married. 
[01:07:30]  Yep.  There'd be nothing that made me happier if he just eloped and got married in a drunken  stupor, and then had to try to tell him, like, all right, thanks, I forget it.  If this was like a Thursday, I think he would have been done for the week, and by Monday  or Tuesday, whenever we do the next show, because I think we're taking Monday off, there'd  be a whole crazy story.  We went to Atlantic City, we were gambling, we, uh...  Yeah, they're going to end up married.  Something crazy.  Let's...  Go ahead, Kyle.  No, I'm saying so far, the dynamic is definitely Anthony in love, and this girl not realizing 
[01:08:00]  what she's got.  She probably had a crush on him, and now she sees his amorous, needy look, and she's  disgusted.  Yeah, that turns a woman off when they look up to you in a way, or they like you, and  they own you all of a sudden that easily.  That's right, yeah.  But this guy wasn't hard to get.  And he was primed for it, yeah.  Just like a schlep.  He's got those big, sick cow eyes looking at her right now.  Where are you going for breakfast?  I don't know.  She's looking at the traffic, like, oh, I wish I was pointing on that.  Yeah.  I should just be doing the traffic today. 
[01:08:30]  He's talking a little...  He's like, you hungry, baby?  She's just like, yuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Sweet little boy's voice.  It was fun, but I'm just going to go shopping for the rest of the day.  Do you think the doe eyes are turning her off?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hank in Connecticut, what's up?  Hey, I just wonder if Anthony's tied up in a basement somewhere and Jill's got the radio  show on.  Linger longer.  Linger longer, my friend.  Has anybody tried to call her? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, can we call her?  She's up.  She's young, man.  She's...  She's still in the prime of her party and, you know, life.  I don't like the way Jim said that like a detective in a movie of the week.  Has anyone tried to call her?  That's the real angle.  You solve the case, shut up.  You solve the case.  I'll use that button on you.  What button?  Just push one, Colin.  Open your mouth!  And stand for it, you eat it!  Steve C is calling no answer. 
[01:09:30]  Steve C is calling Jill no answer?  We're all moaning now.  That was a good call.  Because you're a disgusting fat body, brother Kyle.  Yeah, but you just didn't even know what you were putting in.  I know.  And it kind of worked out, right?  They thought you are a disgusting fat body, brother Kyle!  He tries to pass it off because I'm too happy, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love the soft language he gives himself.  Like it's just a little incidental thing I've put on a few pounds. 
[01:10:00]  Someone is suggesting that Jill is having Anthony do the Silence of the Lambs dance right now.  He sounded like...  What's his name when he called in just now?  Hello, um, could you please?  His voice went a little...  Yeah.  A little...  He sounded like the guy.  Remember, yes.  I love it.  Why are we playing?  Oh, we're just playing the song.  This is the Silence of the Lambs and the Water, right?  Yeah.  It's called, uh...  Horses something, right?  I think it's just...  What is it?  Goodbye, Horses.  Oh, goodbye, Horses.  Sure. 
[01:10:30]  All right.  Let's go to Jason in Carolina.  Jason, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, boys.  I was wondering what's worse.  Anthony having to deal with her dad or Jill having to deal with the millions of fans and pests?  How is she dealing with all the pests?  Just our little...  How nosy we are and how we want to know and it's just killing us.  It's just...  It's sad.  Yeah.  It's just mad.  Someone said it.  I mean, we all feel like we're dating Jill Nicolini.  So, you know, Anthony owes us...  He owes us some information now. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, it was killing me.  I had to know.  I got four text messages.  I read them this morning, but I had to put a lot of blanks in there.  I think the suffocation she feels is not based on the pests yet.  It's just on Anthony and his lovesick look.  She's probably laying in bed.  She's probably wide awake looking at the ceiling, looking at his dumb arm across her chest and  just wanting him to be gone.  He probably likes to cuddle when he sleeps.  And she just wants to be untouched and left alone.  God, what is going on right now? 
[01:11:30]  He's waking up with morning breath, probably trying to...  Can you...  Baby?  You hungry, baby?  He's like, ugh, no.  Jill's voicemail is full.  Can't leave any more moments.  Oh, that's great.  Something bad happened last night.  She left.  He took it out.  She freaked out and left, and he kept calling her to apologize.  I'm calling her.  And she promised she'd call.  I promised her I'd call.  And her friend's like, you didn't call back.  Please call.  Now we're starting to get worried.  You're a doorman.  She's not in.  Something really bad happened. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Jared, Connecticut.  All set.  Yeah.  I didn't realize you were upside down.  Jared.  Hey.  Hey.  The question isn't if they did it.  The question is, does Anthony have the stamina, and how many times did they do it?  Hopefully once, and it was over in about, I'd say, 15 seconds or less.  I think they did it.  I think she enjoyed it last night, but then this morning, he's like, how about a little morning thing?  She's like, oh, I can't believe this is my pattern. 
[01:12:30]  I talk about this with my friends.  I get some guy involved in me, he likes me, I'm disgusted by him, and I want him out.  I think.  She's at that stage.  I think Anthony was proud of himself, because he went maybe three, four times.  Yeah.  And she said, oh, that's adorable.  That's cute.  Like, you know, she was expecting a lot more than that.  I like, I think Jimmy really hit the nail on the head.  She was expecting Opie.  Yeah.  I mean, let's face it, Mick Foley is the guy, right?  He's the one that put them together.  Yeah.  You know, he may give the wrong message.  Yeah, well, no, well, she talked, and she asked for Anthony, but she probably doesn't 
[01:13:00]  listen to the show much.  She probably heard it a couple of times, and her friends always, you know, say, oh, I hope  he's cute, or Anthony's, whatever.  Yeah.  She mixed them up in her head.  Yeah.  Let's see how to Mark.  And then he walked in, and she was like, uh-huh.  Who is it?  Come on.  Cousa blank, a white slavery ringleader.  Let's see how to Mark in New York.  Mark.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Anthony, if you can hear me, please don't wash your fingers until you get back to the show.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  When does this stop being a bitch? 
[01:13:30]  I don't think so.  It's either going to be Jill's father, like, gives us the, quote, warning.  Right.  Or Ann goes, ah, dude, this is really becoming something real, so we're going to have to  somehow figure out how to get out of this.  I just like the fact that he says, Anthony, if you're listening, like, Anthony is a little  too ill to make it in, but he's awake and concerned with the radio show and listening  and jotting down suggestions maybe for tomorrow.  Well, are you all concerned?  Hey, if you guys need to, do a best of.  Yeah.  Or you can go in and do the show yourself. 
[01:14:00]  Can we?  Thanks, Anthony.  What a creep.  Are you calling Anthony and Jill, and where are we at with this whole thing?  Um, well, you heard that Jill's mailbox is full on her phone, correct?  Right.  All right, well.  You heard it on the show that you work on.  Yeah.  Oh.  Forgive me for just clarifying something.  I will never do it again, Colin.  I almost missed what seat you were in.  Um, the, uh, I've been calling both of them dozens of times, sending dozens of text messages. 
[01:14:30]  They're out cold.  You think they're just passed out at this point?  Yeah.  Did you call Anthony's home number?  Uh, do you have it?  Did you call the Chelsea Hotel?  Well, I think they were going to sit in Nancy's state.  No, Anthony!  Yeah, no one will notice your ear is missing.  Just brush your hair over it.  Well, we got, the last message we got was what?  4.30 in the morning?  4.20 something in the morning.  4.20, so they probably stayed up another hour.  Probably right when Ecstasy of Gold, uh, was starting our radio show, they passed out.  Wait a minute.  You don't think that Anthony woke up to come in and then realized he had a 24-hour bug? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I guess not.  I think that's what happened.  I think that they probably went to bed early, you know, and, uh, maybe 10 o'clock and they  woke up at 4 and Anne goes, I'm not feeling too well.  She said, well, you better call in.  And maybe she has it too.  And then went home.  Oh, and right now he's like, let's get married at the Taj.  Yeah.  And they're driving down AC.  Oh.  She's sobering up and realizing, oh God, I just want to be at work away from this obsessed  creep.  He's prattling on. 
[01:15:30]  You know, actually, the Jersey Shore is the New Hamptons, huh?  Let's say hi to somebody in Texas.  Uh, what's up, buddy?  Hi, this is Mark.  Hey, Mark.  How are you?  Hey, I know what happened.  Anthony moaned her all night long and stuff.  And the morning when he woke up, she woke up, he was staring right at her and he said,  I love you.  And she said, all right, then.  And now he's like 10 years old crying with spitballs falling out of his mouth.  Mm-hmm.  I think that's what happened. 
[01:16:00]  What'd you say?  I think he told me I love you.  Yes, yes.  I heard well.  Obviously, it's time to take a break.  He loved you a long time.  Yeah.  There's David Tell here, too, man.  David Tell will be joining the show next.  Jill's dad will be on next segment.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to your radio, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Gee, that's a low blow.  You know I was really trying to get that job.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:16:30]  It's a clusterfp today, but that's okay.  We got Colin Quinn sitting in for Anthony.  Yeah, where's Anthony?  What happened?  Hi-oh.  David Tell asking where Anthony is while Anthony went out with Jill Nicolini.  Do you watch Channel 11 here in New York?  Who doesn't?  The traffic of Vixen with the big boobies.  All right, yeah.  He's a hotter.  Mick Foley came in with a message from Jill.  Brother.  Peter, what, only a few days ago, saying that Jill was single and interested in Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  It quickly developed. 
[01:17:00]  They went out on a date last night.  Right.  And, uh...  Look at that picture, Dave.  See you.  I know, yeah, wow.  And Jill called in sick, and so did Anthony.  Well, that's the magic of Fleet Week.  You know?  You know, maybe they're a little upset over Ted Kennedy's condition.  Oh-ho.  Dave, you don't want to go there.  Saying a novena or whatnot.  We have Jill...  Oh, I don't realize.  So they just, uh...  What did they meet at?  The upfront radio thingy?  They, uh...  At the radio-ease? 
[01:17:30]  They just...  Wow.  Yeah, there's another naked picture of it.  You know, we're not going to be allowed to be...  We're not going to be allowed to look at these very, very soon.  It's very soon.  We got to get them out, yeah.  She looks a little Latino.  Is she Latino?  Oh, she's Italian.  Don't say that, because her father's on the phone.  She's a proud Italian.  Her father's a real old-school gindaloon.  I don't believe he was on yesterday.  Very old school.  Well, that explains it.  She's shaving.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's helping her wax it.  Travis, what happened?  Uh-oh, he hung up the phone.  Oh, no.  Did we say something? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, no, no.  He's a great guy.  Where is he?  He would rather talk to her first before he goes on the air, and he can't get in touch with her.  He spoke to her at 3.20 this morning.  Okay.  Uh, and he pretty much knows just as much as you guys know, but he would rather talk to  her before he gives what he says.  Translation.  That means you've got the Louisville Slug.  He's looking for Anthony right now.  Translation.  She writes his lines for him.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I'm thinking.  Translation.  Iron Man rocks. 
[01:18:30]  Am I right?  Yeah.  I hate to change the subject.  Come on, Dave.  Where are my nerds?  Come on.  Let's go.  Dave, you hit it the nail on the head.  Maybe that's what they did.  They went to see a late-night Iron Man screening.  Sure.  We're talking about it.  David.  Yeah?  I went to see Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Oh, you did?  I heard that's the new Juno.  I like that smart comedy, too.  Let's say hi to Travis in New Hampshire.  Travis, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  What's up, boys? 
[01:19:00]  Greg Audio.  Hey, listen.  I just want to know, are you guys going to sell tickets so that we can all line up?  I speak for all listeners, by the way, about where we can line up and smell Ant's fingers?  Well, we did tell Anthony he has to come in with her panties.  Kind of like Revenge of the Nerds.  Pretty in Pink.  Oh, she doesn't wear panties?  That's a give up.  She's a radio woman.  No, she does TV.  She's a TV girl.  Oh, really?  She's very attractive.  Yeah.  I really hope that we're building this up, and maybe they kiss at the end of the night,  and Anthony is just hung over and alone, and she's just depressed because she can't 
[01:19:30]  believe she kissed that zero.  Did you hear her next room?  He goes, what do I say?  I was kidding, yes.  That was at 4.30 in the morning.  They were still hanging out together.  Wow.  We know that much so far.  Let's go to Mongo the Trucker.  Mongo.  Hey, do you think Jill uses traffic terms in the middle of sex?  It's like, oh my God, the tunnel is full, and there's a hazmat spilled by the sewage  treatment plant.  You're ready for morning zoo radio, my friend.  You're right there.  You got me. 
[01:20:00]  I see on the phone, Anthony.  I'm thinking it's the Anthony, but it's Jill's brother, Anthony.  The whole film is named Anthony.  Yeah.  Anthony, what's going on?  Yeah, well, I'm with my sister.  I hope she's missing out work.  Hey, don't blame us, my friend.  We had nothing to do with this.  Nothing to do with it.  You didn't hear anything from either of them?  Well, Anthony called in sick.  Anthony is known to get cold this time of year.  He called in.  He said he wasn't feeling too well.  He had a bit of a 24-hour bug.  And, you know, maybe they were drinking a bit. 
[01:20:30]  Who knows?  Yeah, they might have a little handy.  Yeah, I hope he didn't put his hands on it to break his fingers.  Nah.  That's the spirit.  Get the fungal back and get over there.  I don't know.  I'm going to have to call my sister.  Is he over at our house?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, whoa.  No, I don't think he would be at our house.  He's not that stupid.  Just go over there and knock on the door.  She might be over there.  She's stupid.  Just knock on the door.  Yeah, so.  Then knock him out.  Jill called in sick.  Anthony called in sick.  What do you think there, Anthony? 
[01:21:00]  I don't know.  I think something's up.  You think something's up?  Yeah, I think my sister might have been doing something.  You got to watch out for her.  Anthony, I'm in a five-bedroom house.  She probably fell asleep in another bedroom.  It's nothing sexual.  Is she going to break his heart?  Is he going to break her heart?  No.  Is she going to break his heart, I said.  Oh, I don't know.  You see Jill's track record?  What am I talking about?  I think he's in love.  What do you think of her track record?  She goes behind one guy per year, so. 
[01:21:30]  They might have a good year with her.  Wow.  A couple months.  And did they end up stalking her at the end?  Is he or is she?  No, did they end up stalking her?  No, they get over it.  They get over it?  Yeah.  What's the story of a hockey player possibly having something glued to his thigh?  Garth Snow?  Was it Garth?  I don't know.  She dated Garth Snow, yeah.  Well, no.  I don't know if that's true, by the way.  Did you get tickets?  Coach Mike, what was the Russian Malloy thing that came in?  They said they heard a rumor alleging that the hockey player had something glued to his thigh by Jill. 
[01:22:00]  Wow.  Did you hear anything?  I don't know.  I've never heard of that.  No.  That's new to me.  Any other girls at home?  The other girls?  Do you have any other sisters?  I have one of her sisters.  She's married with a baby boy.  Named Anthony, right?  Yes.  John Anthony, yes.  See, there's a lot of Anthony's in this Nicolini family, so this is perfect.  So, any advice to Anthony, because he might be in deep now there. 
[01:22:30]  Any advice?  Yeah.  I think he's a grown man.  He can handle himself.  Just go up alone.  I don't know.  I don't know if he should be settled in a bumper pool in a basement.  That's no news to me.  I heard all this yesterday.  It's the first time I heard about this, so.  Right.  All right.  Well, we're patiently waiting for somebody to check in, either Anthony or Jill.  We want your father to call in, but she's trying to hunt down Jill right now.  Does she drink a lot?  Anthony, does she drink a lot?  She don't drink a lot, but when she drinks, she can keep up with me, so. 
[01:23:00]  All right, cool.  We call it a periodic.  Yeah.  Occasionally, they drink for three or four days.  A tear.  Yeah.  I try to get in touch with her.  I'll call my boss.  I try to get in touch with Jill.  Yeah, we want to hear from one of them before the show ends.  The whole city's shut down.  We've got to find this guy.  This kid's not going to work.  She's not going to work.  How are they doing traffic without her?  Exactly.  People do the tie-up over on the something and something.  Yeah, everyone has to suffer because she stayed out late with Anthony last night.  I don't know, man.  All right, yeah, I'll keep in touch, and hopefully someone will hear from one of us. 
[01:23:30]  All right, thank you, Anthony.  Sounds like a job for Bill Curtis.  Bill's brother.  Yeah.  Bill Curtis.  Where is Anthony?  All right, we'll start with this.  This might lead to something.  We're hoping.  Keep your fingers crossed.  We might get Anthony on the phone before we leave this side of the show.  We're going to start with Anthony calling in sick.  Everyone must know what's going on.  Jill has a crush on Anthony.  I think Anthony's a bit smitten. 
[01:24:00]  They decided to go out last night, and we all knew Anthony, you know, he doesn't have any type of restraint in his body.  So we knew that today would be the day we do a show without Anthony.  Jill Nicolini, of course, the traffic vixen from Channel 11 here in New York City.  And this is the phone call.  We got text messages all night long.  And at 4.30 in the morning, Anthony left this message for Steve.  Hi, Steve.  I'm really sick.  I'm not going to be able to make it in. 
[01:24:30]  I'm creeped out by how he's talking.  Colin brought it up earlier.  I don't think you're going to make it in.  Pacino sounded more masculine, giving his last will and testament in Dog Day Afternoon.  How?  Nothing?  I can't believe that guy got nothing.  I'm so happy with that one.  No.  Colin?  Eric, what do you think?  You didn't sound that gay in Dog Day Afternoon, Pacino.  Really?  I love you more than any man has ever loved another man?  Dear Leon.  That was a bad impression.  But it wasn't feminine the way he said it. 
[01:25:00]  Of course it was.  The words might have been feminine.  Well, whatever it was, you know what I meant.  How good is Jill Nicolini that she effed the man right out of him?  Not only that, but how about Nicolini Carding of Massapequa Park, her father and her brother,  and they're like these two Italian dudes.  I don't think I'm going to beat Anthony Senseless if he doesn't make an honest woman out of her.  All right, back to the Anthony Folk.  Send him more masculine.  Tom Hanks.  Hi, Steve.  I'm really sick. 
[01:25:30]  I'm not going to be able to make it in today.  Sounds like Leonard one.  Today.  I don't know if, like, Hope wants to do the show with Jimmy, but I'm really ill.  I don't think I'm going to make it in.  Yeah.  Give me a call if you have any questions, but I don't know.  If they want to do the show, that's okay.  We know that, stupid. 
[01:26:00]  Permission from you.  Yeah.  Where's the other part where it looks like she feeds him?  I don't think she feeds him.  I caught what happened.  What?  Watch.  Want me to go back?  No, no, no, no.  Let it play through.  Okay.  That's all I'm the best of, but I'm, yeah, I'm really sick.  I think I got, like, a 24-hour bug.  What?  Yeah, I'm throwing up.  Yeah, I'm throwing up and stuff.  Right there.  What she said to Anthony was, you make me want to throw up.  And he misunderstood. 
[01:26:30]  And what he heard was.  Yeah, I'm throwing up.  He thought it was part of the cute game.  I'm throwing up and stuff.  That's good.  So I don't think I'm going to make it in.  All right.  Bye.  A lot of people on Pal Talk, they're screaming, bit, bit, bit.  No, no bit.  Anthony knew he had at least, like, you know, call Steve and let everyone know that he's  not coming in because he's obviously still partying.  And so he's playing the sick thing, you know, in a very awful way. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Awfully.  Yeah.  All right.  So then we took Anthony's phone call.  We've been doing these, like, TMZ-type promos.  Are you trying to get Anthony?  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, he went back to sleep.  What are you talking about?  The least he can do is call the effing radio show.  What a creep.  I'm going to have to go to the emergency room in, like, 15 minutes here to get some  one of those shots to make sure I don't die.  I had him. 
[01:27:30]  I had him.  He sounded very tired, very crackly.  I said, just stay conscious for 10 minutes so we can get you on the phone.  He said, all right.  Were we in commercial when he got him?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  And he said, okay.  And I called him.  I just started calling him.  Bad Travis was calling him, and that's going right to voicemail.  And I'm just nonstop redialing both their numbers.  Just keep doing that.  Yep.  When we went back to sleep, boy, Jill said, hey, what are you doing?  I thought I'd call in.  Are they, uh, are they, uh, it's all right, honey.  Are they together?  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  So they actually went their separate ways, got up, and met for breakfast?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Uh, we took, uh, Anthony's sick call and did this.  And now for an update on Anthelini Gate 08.  The two apparently went on a hot Long Island date last night that was so steamy it kept them away from work this morning.  Hi, Steve.  I'm really sick.  Um, I'm not going to be able to make it in, but, yeah, I'm throwing up. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, I'm throwing up and stuff.  Really?  I think I got, like, a 24-hour bug.  After Anthony left a series of text messages for his co-workers, we can only speculate on exactly what went on last night.  But what we can say is that there was a whole lot of blanking going on.  Dude, this is some serious blank.  I'm, uh, I'm going blank to blank blank.  We'll keep you updated as the Anthelini saga continues. 
[01:29:00]  And, and, and Anthony went back to sleep?  He turned his phone off.  How do you turn your phone off?  When it dumps right into voicemail, that means his phone's off.  Right.  Well, maybe he fell asleep on the line.  No.  Okay.  She told him, turn your phone off and stop the nonsense, and he did what he was told.  Of course.  Of course.  This is turning into a real thing now.  Yeah.  This is going to be the last day of the, uh, Anthelini thing.  Yeah.  We're all going to get the calls later, dudes, you know, uh, it would have been nice to end 
[01:29:30]  the show with a phone call from Anthony.  Yeah.  I thought he could hold on for five minutes.  Guys, it's Opie.  I know what you're thinking.  A big effing letdown.  That's how we ended it.  Hopefully, we'll get more info on the next Opie and Anthony show.  We'll see you next time.  It's amazing.  It's spectacular.  It's...  Whip about Wednesday.  Wow.  Opie.  What do they like anyway?  They look pretty good.  Are they real?  What do you do with them? 
[01:30:00]  Motorboat?  You play the motorboat?  Wow.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m.  Eastern.

The Nevada Department of Public Safety, Office of Traffic Safety, says that cops are enforcing seatbelt laws.  Buckle up unless you want to see how much a ticket can cost.  Click it or ticket.  The Las Vegas home of the boys in blue. 
[01:30:30]  Dodgers baseball.  Hi, this is Chris Cornell, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  We're talking about Sue Simmons.  She dropped the F-bomb on the news the other night, and we thought it was hilarious, and she's back on the air, and that's where she should be.  She made a dumb mistake.  And everyone should move on.  But we broke out some of our favorite clips of when anchors go bad.  We were discussing the weatherman fight.  Yep.  And then we got distracted by the robot that was conducting the orchestra. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah, if we could, shiny things really get us.  Why would you want a robot to do that?  Like, who figured that out?  You should never know that.  That he can actually do that.  What's his name?  It's a waste of resources.  What's that robot's name?  We've seen him.  It's Osmo or something like that.  Osmo.  We saw him at...  I am Osmo.  We saw him at CES, kicking a soccer ball and walking in a circle.  It is freaky to watch it.  And walking upstairs.  Yeah, it could go upstairs.  It ran.  It was really...  It was like running across the stage. 
[01:31:30]  Do you know eventually people will be fighting for robot rights?  Maybe within a hundred years.  You'll beat a robot with a stick and people will get upset with you.  I guarantee because they look human.  It'll be too realistic looking.  That would be hysterical.  Yeah.  Because I would just make a point of like raping the robot in the parking lot.  Just robot rape?  The future.  The crimes of the future.  Teaching your robot a lesson?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just smack it around like this.  It'll push your shopping cart. 
[01:32:00]  I think Jimmy's right.  It'll push your shopping cart around in the store.  And then if it keeps going, you just like smack in the head.  Hey, stupid.  Stop.  Yeah.  Then you get people all mad at you.  His little legs would kick as you're raising the robot.  Here's Osmo.  That's me.  The Detroit Symphony Orchestra was led by an unlikely conductor last night.  Check this out.  A shiny four-foot-tall white robot called Asimo, I guess.  No, it's not Asimo, you dummy. 
[01:32:30]  Asimo.  Do your research.  It's at least Asimo.  Asimo.  Or Asimo.  But it's not Asimo.  Asimo, I guess.  Careful.  Okay.  Took the stain.  Careful.  Led the symphony in a performance of Impossible Dream from the musical, of course, Man of La  Mancha.  Asimo.  He thinks these musicians are going to pay attention to a robot like they need.  That just goes to show you what the conductor does.  Right.  I think they know how to play their instruments.  The conductor was the guy that, like, couldn't play anything, I think. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  And he just shows up.  It's just a gym.  I want to play, too.  All right, grab a stick.  He's a gym teacher.  Wave it.  He really is worthless.  It's Michael J. Fox's future job.  Watch.  Too much.  But he can only do Flight of the Bumblebee.  That little culture joke for you.  It'd be all over the place trying to follow the horse.  Oh, God.  Man of La Mancha.  Asimo stands for Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility. 
[01:33:30]  It was designed by Honda Motor Company.  The robot even took a bow.  That's pretty neat.  It looks like there's somebody in there.  Yeah, I bet.  What, a midget?  C-3PO or something.  No one's hiding out in there.  C-3PO's in there?  Wait a minute.  Who's hiding out in there?  Asimo.  These anchor people are the dumbest people on earth.  They truly are.  It's based totally on their look. 
[01:34:00]  And how they read.  And if they can read.  That's it.  Without tripping up.  All right, when anchors go bad.  So the CNN weatherman, it was Hurricane Katrina, we think.  I'm pretty sure.  So this was his big moment, and he really wanted to over-explain the weather.  And the anchor lady wanted nothing to do with this.  Had to cut him off.  He was getting a little over-sealous.  It's like, will you just give us the basics here?  No one cares about your weather jargon.  This is how it went down.  A couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit.  Filled in with some air.  Not as low of pressure. 
[01:34:30]  Chad.  But Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  You know, we should add a little more of what he was saying before that.  Really?  Because it shows like, it shows how stupid he was.  Yeah.  Like, that doesn't really, it shows her jumping in, but doesn't really show like, he was just babbling.  Yeah, we could help it along.  Obviously, he was going on, he was long-winded.  And it was about barometric pressure.  Yeah.  And she was just completely fed up with it.  Chad's a bore, and Carol is a castrating C. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, what a bitch.  Chad got wedgies in school when he was growing up.  Yep.  Chad's garbage.  A couple of hours ago, so it has filled in a little bit.  Filled in with some air, not as low of pressure.  But Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would, let me talk.  Okay.  Oh.  Come on.  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as strong as Camille, but not really as strong as it's been. 
[01:35:30]  Now he's all tripped up.  As it's been.  908.  I'm walking over here.  She broke his rhythm.  I have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  See, she broke, she totally took him out.  She dismembered him.  That was it.  He didn't know.  This was 8, 3, 9, 2.  How mad is Chad?  This was his big moment.  And she just.  She blew up his spot.  She whizzed on it.  Yeah, but she actually.  He thought she was going to tell him to shut up.  But she just wanted him to dumb it down for us. 
[01:36:00]  She was just like, hey, can you tell us what that.  Yeah.  So he snapped.  He snapped for the wrong reason.  But the way she did it, though.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad now.  You dumb it down for our stupid audience.  Then he tried to dumb it down, but he couldn't.  No.  I had a chart here.  Oh, good gravy.  But he said something like gravy.  He just lost it.  It's not as bad as Camille, but it is worse than it has been.  He said.  Yeah, yeah.  She ruined him.  Some non-point he made.  She was every, like, attractive girl to him in school. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  That he would just start sweating profusely when they came near him.  That was what she did.  Yeah.  She talked to him like that, and he just became a child.  In high school, he had, you want a movie?  It's me to the take you.  What?  You know, most weathermen are gay.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, that's it.  I used to have a gay roommate who was becoming a weatherman.  Oh, really?  He used to practice his blue screen on me.  Oh, really? 
[01:37:00]  Techniques.  How did he spell it?  But, yeah, he told me.  Okay, thank you, Jimmy.  Wow.  Oof.  Oof.  That's a good one.  But that doesn't make him gay, because you know one gay guy who has wanted to be a weatherman,  and they're all fruits?  Yeah, I know.  You know one guy.  Now that you know that, now that you know that, because he did it to me, too, now that  you know that, watch All Weathermen.  You're going to be like, wow, that guy is gay.  I didn't even know he was gay.  Watch.  All right, we're going to do that.  I know a couple that have been pretty prominent here in New York that have been a little swishy.  You know, watch it now. 
[01:37:30]  It's going to be on your mind.  I'm not going to say their names, because, you know, you don't want to make allegations  like that.  We met a weatherman recently on the streets.  All man.  This guy was all man.  All man.  And made sure he told us.  So maybe he's heard the chattering.  And he wanted to make sure that we knew that he was all man.  All man.  Creeped us out, this guy.  He leaned in within three minutes of knowing him.  Yeah.  And bragged telling us about sexploits.  And bragged that he's banging a bra that's 25, 26 years younger than him. 
[01:38:00]  And then, oh, wow.  He was just all man.  Oh, yeah.  Let's get back to this clip.  It's weird, too.  You never see any big, fat pigs that are like anchors.  Hold on.  Bill from Waterford.  You are correct, sir.  He was naming the weatherman.  That's all man.  Yeah.  All man.  Bragging about his age.  Bragging about his sexploits.  I'm like, dude, we just met you.  Relax.  How about a, hey, how are you doing?  The only people that are fat are weathermen, too. 
[01:38:30]  There's never any fat anchors.  It's really weird when you look at all the anchors.  You can be husky if you're a sports guy.  You can be husky.  Yeah.  Like a linebacker.  Yeah.  Can be fat, though.  Never a big, fat, morbidly obese anchor.  I guess if nobody wants to listen to you in life, you don't get any respect anywhere.  I want to leave radio.  I want to be a news director, and I want to just do the fat news.  Two huge fat anchors, a huge fat weatherman, a huge fat reporter on the street.  Who wouldn't watch that?  I would watch every night, and I would advertise that it's the fat news. 
[01:39:00]  Fat news.  And it's all about just awful, like, you know, food stories, and just over-the-top fat.  You can just hear them breathing into their microphone.  Yeah.  Oh, the wheezing.  Oh, yeah.  The weatherman is a burn victim.  Oh, it's going to be really hot today.  So I'll be in the house.  My face sure could use some rain.  And I know heat.  It's going to be windy, so hold on to your wings. 
[01:39:30]  And wear sunglasses because your eyes can't shut.  It's going to be a dry day.  Bring plenty of visine.  It's going to be windy today, so I'm going to have to stay indoors because I can't close my eyes.  Too much dust gets in them.  It's going to be a balmy 40, so put a lot of sunblock on it.  It's going to be very windy, so make sure you dip your head in Vaseline.  Horrible. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, God, that's horrible.  All right, can we get back to the weather guy losing it here, Chad?  Chad.  Not really as strong as it's been.  908.  I'm walking over here because I have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  908 millibars is 26.81 inches of mercury.  All right.  Thank you, Chad.  All right.  Just having fun with you this morning.  No.  He can't even be honest.  He can't even be honest for a second.  Just having fun with you.  No, it wasn't fun. 
[01:40:30]  You were just thinking C-word in your head.  Yeah, he hates Carl.  By the way, Struff writes, play the gay weatherman who freaked out at a cockroach.  See, that's what we should be playing today because Bob's talking about how every weatherman's gay.  We've got the ultimate gay guy doing the weather and freaking out over a cockroach.  The third clip from when anchors go bad.  This happened here in New York.  Not many people have this clip.  We were lucky to get this one.  Steve Bartlestein and Bill Evans going at it. 
[01:41:00]  Yep.  When Trump was getting married.  Trump was getting married and Bartlestein attempted to say her name.  I can't even say her name.  It's Melania Nouse, I think.  Melania, whatever.  Right.  Sure.  Yeah, right.  Good.  What you say.  And number four.  And Bartlestein tried to say the name and Bill Evans just started laughing at him.  Because he's having a real moment.  I like when these guys have real moments.  Yeah.  He starts laughing like, you dummy, you really messed that name up.  And they just went at it. 
[01:41:30]  Listen to this.  Have you seen this?  This is a new dress.  It's something old, something new, and something that costs about 100 grand.  Here's a look at the wedding dress made for a supermodel.  Melania Nouse, the former or the future, Mr.  Why don't I go over that name again, Steve?  What was that?  You know what?  Why don't you do it, Bill?  No, I'm not the anchor, Steve.  Melania, right?  Why don't you go over it?  Why don't you do it?  I'm not the anchor.  Well, you know what?  Then I'll pipe down over there during the video.  What then, Steve?  Go ahead.  Do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin. 
[01:42:00]  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I would just, I wouldn't have known what you said.  If you're not the anchor, then don't.  Go, baby, go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano for Christian York.  See, Noah is great.  Listen to him just laughing at him.  That is the best part of the clip.  He's not going to let it go.  He just keeps laughing right in his face.  I got to read this one.  Yeah.  We'll go back.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  It says here on PalTalk, burn victim weatherman equals surprising forecast.  What is that? 
[01:42:30]  Ice take fan?  Thank you.  Very funny.  Surprising forecast.  I think there's a...  Vaseline.  I think there's a hurricane coming.  The weatherman is very surprised.  It's going to be high winds, so leave those wigs and wax lips at home.  Or I'll get blown into a puddle.  What do you want, Steve?  Go ahead and do it, Bill.  It has 300 feet of satin.  If you're not the anchor, then don't interrupt me.  I just...  I wanted to know what you said. 
[01:43:00]  If you're not the anchor, then don't...  Go, baby.  Go.  Go.  The guy was designed by John Galliano for Christian New York.  And the bride finds another dress of her wing design after the couple's first dance.  Wedding is set for Saturday.  Why don't you give it a shot there, Bill?  Hey.  I'm just representing the audience.  I'm just representing...  I heard...  And I'm just saying...  My bad.  My bad.  I'm sorry, Bill.  I'm not looking for an apology, sir.  I'm just saying, would you like to take another shot?  No, I wouldn't.  I don't know.  I can't take a shot at it.  That's why I do the weather.  I don't read that stuff. 
[01:43:30]  It is so cold outside.  It is cold outside.  It's cold in here, too.  Take a shot at the weather if you want.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm good with that.  Hey, dude.  Okay.  I get paid either way.  Oh, you know, you know, you know.  It's such cold for the weather to start today.  And it will be a day where it will be a cold day.  What a baby.  Barb Osteen is.  What a baby.  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the world of Astoria. 
[01:44:00]  ESPY's got one, too.  Today's forecast, pain and embarrassment.  Oh.  Oh.  That's right.  Today is going to be called for some taped-on sunglasses.  Oh, God.  And half of my thigh placed on my cheek.  Oh, my God.  What?  Now you've got too far.  You can't keep it fun and light, can you?  I'm sorry.  They turn their head into the wind.  Wee! 
[01:44:30]  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Wee!  Old flute ears.  Fuck.  What did you call it?  Old flute ears.  Old flute ears.  This is horrible.  This is so horrible.  Oh, my God.  Those two little weird drains on the side of your head.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky. 
[01:45:00]  Today's weather is brought to you by Chapstick and a Leaf.  You want to hear the gay weatherman freaking out over the cockroach?  Yeah.  Sure.  Sounds great.  This comes from Sarasota, Florida.  We'll be pushing across central Florida.  So places like Orlando, Daytona Beach, the Cape Canaveral area, Vero Beach will be getting in on the heavier rainfall.  And eventually, I should can...  I am so sorry, Bill. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God!  What the hell just happened?  Oh, my God!  This is what just happened.  That thing was crawling on my leg.  Mmm.  Go from weatherman to Grand Marshal to the gay parade.  You can look down, it's a woman.  Oh, this thing!  They've taken it off and put a hole where it should be! 
[01:46:00]  There's another part to this.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Oh, no!  Right at the wall for me!  What did he see?  His father?  Woo!  Oh, I'm going to prove my theory.  All right.  And, well, yeah, it really is backing up your theory.  All he needs is a cockroach. 
[01:46:30]  You know, we're talking about weather.  We've got to find out what the weather is in Haiti, if you don't mind there, Robert.  I've been whatsoever wearing.  It's going to be hot.  Is that it?  And I don't need a jacket.  Thanks, Arthur.  Why did he laugh like that over that line?  He's still trying to figure it out.  I don't know.  If I remember him putting a tarantula on someone's face while they were still awake in a coffin.  Stupid Haiti, right? 
[01:47:00]  Just remembering that Bill Paxton face, looking up at him, blinking, yet not moving his head.  Dr. Allen!  Lovely.  God.  Just want to play this for everybody because we've got a lot of Sex and the City stuff to do today.  Jim Norton, no reference past 1990, someone just wrote.  It is amazing.  Today, so far, we've got Peter Finch, the serpent and the rainbow.  Yeah.  You're right.  Finished.  18 years. 
[01:47:30]  18 years or more.  Over.  Oh, God.  It's the official Opie and Anthony Sex and the City U.S. premiere countdown.  16 days.  Wah-ha.  Wah-ha.  Opie and Anthony.  Guess how many boobs I've done today.  Whip them out Wednesday.  They've got these stickers all over New York and it's called Whip them out Wednesday.  You drive around.  Yeah.  The lovely ladies see it.  They pull up next to you and maybe give it a little lift. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, what's going on?  This is Bill Burr.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, boy, I haven't heard this song in a while.  Yeah, I do like this song, though.  I love this song.  They performed it live on our show.  Yes.  The station here in New York really loves this song because they play it every hour.  I don't change the station when this song comes on. 
[01:48:30]  It's a guilty pleasure.  Yeah, I like it.  No, it's more than a guilty pleasure.  It's a cool riff.  It's just short of being a rock song.  What?  Do you know what I mean?  Just short of?  Yeah, it's like pop rock.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm not trashing Finger Eleven.  No, I'm saying like...  These guys are friends of ours, actually.  They've done the show a few times.  Rock doesn't have to all be thrash or hardcore or something.  Music lovers know what I'm talking about.  It's just short of being a legit rock song. 
[01:49:00]  This isn't Matchbox 20.  No.  No.  Open Anthony on your radio dial.  All right.  We don't know what to do with this.  It's a bit in progress.  We're brave enough to tell you that.  Other radio stations would not go on the air with things until they got it all figured out.  But that's the beauty of our show.  We like to try to just throw this stuff on the air and see where it goes.  Anthony and I are obsessed with the fact that Sex and the City, the movie, is coming out soon. 
[01:49:30]  We're not going to go see this movie.  No.  We don't understand why there's such a buzz on this movie.  Yeah, I'm obsessed with the phenomenon.  The whole thing around it.  The way the media is covering this.  And no one's bringing up the fact that these are four or at least three and a half hags.  I'll go three out of four.  The dark-haired one.  The dark-haired one you're talking about is like, okay.  Kristen Davis. 
[01:50:00]  Now, listen.  I saw the trailer for Sex and the City for the first time in the office because we're really trying to get our Sex and the City knowledge.  Well, yes.  So three out of the four are cougars at best.  They're hags, okay?  The fourth one, Kristen Davis, is the hot one.  She's the brunette.  Yeah.  They have her knocked up in the movie.  She's not even, yeah.  So you can't even see her looking all sexy and stuff.  She's very pregnant in the trailer I was watching.  Opie, let me ask you something.  As somebody, I'm talking about you, who has watched the show. 
[01:50:30]  Somebody who has watched Sex and the City.  I'm the only one.  As I know you have.  I'm the only one.  Was she, it's not going to make any difference whatsoever, but it was on back in the day when I was living in hell.  That's fine.  That's fine.  I understand.  As somebody who watched the show faithfully.  You watched it faithfully?  Did, uh, was the dark-haired one, uh, sexual on the show?  Was she one that, like, would, would have the sex? 
[01:51:00]  Because I know Samantha was quite the animal.  That's why men and women will never truly get along.  Because Kristen Davis would, would be the one you'd want to see, uh, having all the sex.  Right.  Because she was pretty hot.  But guess what?  She had to be more the prudish one.  Was she the prude?  And the innocent one.  And the, uh, the, uh, the, she can't believe what the others, gals are doing.  Exactly.  So, so lucky us, we get the, the oldest of all of them being the one that's, you know, having all the sex.  And talking about it.  Kim Cattrall with that chocolate chip on her face. 
[01:51:30]  Ugh.  Speaking of chocolate chip.  Chocolate chip.  I was with this guy Chip and his black friend last night.  The Atlanta, the Atlanta Hawks came to town.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Are you having more sex, are you?  I think I washed the blouse with one of my sweat socks.  Oh, I shouldn't use sock.  Because I can't say pink sock.  See, it's okay to be a whore.  Yeah, see, because you can't go sock, sock.  I understand, Jim.  It's just another, but you can try it.  That's okay, no, no, hold on.  I'm just going to crash and bail. 
[01:52:00]  I washed my thing with my black sweat socks, and then I got a pink sock.  You can use socks in a row.  Yeah.  If you're making a point to use socks.  Damn.  Comedy's so hard.  Black sock, and then I got a pink sock.  What are you guys doing?  We're just running through it here.  Like, if you say Anthony was mad at himself because he said black sock, but if you would  have said a black sock, and then I got a pink sock, it would have been like, no.  Yeah.  But you'd have said black sock and pink sock.  Pink sock.  Are you teaching a course at, like, stand-up?  No, but I know what he means.  He's awful.  Anthony's very smart.  The annex.  Anthony was always the annex. 
[01:52:30]  The annex.  The learning annex.  Yeah, hey.  Rave equals polarity.  We used to do fart equals funny.  Speaking of which, coming up on this radio show, we're doing Gas for Gas.  We finally figured out what kind of gas promotion we want to do.  Oh, we're going to give out free gas, and the media should run with this.  We really are going to be giving out free gas.  They'll run.  And I think in two or three different locations, we're going all out.  Free gas for our listeners, but the catch is you got to, like, give some gas to get some gas. 
[01:53:00]  So if you can't, like, fart on the spot, you don't get our free gas.  Ah!  Gas for gas.  Is there any way of measuring, like, how good or dense a fart is?  I don't know.  You have to have people's faces right next to everything.  Yeah, of course.  So back to Sex and the City, 16 days and counting before the movie.  Very excited.  Hits the theaters.  And today we start with our Sex and the City coverage by just trashing Rolling Stone magazine. 
[01:53:30]  We've talked about how much they have lost it, and they just suck them out.  By the way, if you want guys to see the Sex and the City movie, you would have casted the chicks from The Hills.  The Hills.  Oh, my God.  There's a cover of Rolling Stone with the girls from The Hills.  Some show I've never seen in my life.  You're going to start watching immediately, though, right?  Wow.  Look at the ass.  See, you cast these girls for the Sex and the City movie, guess what?  Now you're going to do some numbers because every guy's going to go see it with their broad. 
[01:54:00]  Their broad.  The word of the day, once again, is broad.  They had Sarah's hands on TMZ yesterday.  They just showed her hand.  They didn't tell you who it was.  They showed her hand.  They guess who this is.  And it looks like a guy hand.  Whose hands were they?  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Her hand is atrocious.  Yeah, pretty bad.  They were calling it Frankenstein hand.  And then they just pull back and it's her mole witch face attached to that zombie hand.  It looked like they got her out of Raiders of the Lost Ark. 
[01:54:30]  You're obsessed with the mole, too, right, Robert?  Oh, that mole.  It's not sexy.  I had a few moles.  Guess what?  You go to a dermatologist, they snip those effers right off.  I had 18 down where you shouldn't have them.  I had all 18.  Oh, Jesus.  Those aren't moles.  They look like mushrooms.  Oh, God.  But those aren't moles?  No.  One bad sexual experience, you get a bunch of shikakis.  Shikakis.  It looked like tree hands, that kid from India. 
[01:55:00]  All right, if I didn't know any better, I went to TMZ here, and I'm looking at the picture  that Bobby just described.  Go to TMZ.com.  I'm looking at that hand.  And if you didn't know Sarah Jessica Parker's hand, you would think it was the old lady  from the Titanic movie.  No exaggeration.  You would say that lady's, that's a hand of an 80-year-old lady.  It's disgusting.  Easy.  Wow.  Did you see Madonna's arms, by the way?  Yeah, they showed those in the Daily News.  Her man arms? 
[01:55:30]  She's 50 now with man arms?  Yeah, definitely yoga arms.  They have more than yoga arms.  She needs a little bit of body fat, I think.  Wow.  She needs a little bit of whole milk and ice cream in her diet.  But there you go.  She's got Iggy pop arms.  There you go.  The chicks from the hills, they're on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.  That's what, you know, these girls should have been in Sex and the City.  What is the hills, though?  Is it a TV show?  Yeah.  It's probably the hottest show ever.  I've never seen it, don't know anything about it, but based on the cover of Rolling  Stones, it's got to be the hottest show ever. 
[01:56:00]  Unbelievable.  All right, so, Rolling Stone magazine.  So they review Sex and the City.  Listen to this.  It's a couple paragraphs.  Macho men fear this movie.  As the one summer chick flick they will be dragged to no matter how hard they protest.  Really?  And then this reviewer writes, relax.  It's the ladies and the metrosexuals who will make or break the film version of Sex and  the City.  Must viewing for everyone who ever cared about shoes, hair, nails, and men. 
[01:56:30]  In that order.  All right.  We will never get along with the opposite sex.  Is that a guy writing that?  Women eat this crap up.  A guy or a woman?  It has to.  Well, I don't know.  That's a good question, Jimmy.  Peter Travers, I think.  It is Peter?  Yeah, it's Peter Travers.  It's a guy.  In that order.  The trailer for Sex and the City seems to hard sell the comedy when the show always 
[01:57:00]  took its time, letting the humor and even the drama subtly seep in.  Oh, really?  Only a fool would question Sarah Jessica Parker's fashion superhero status as Carrie Bradshaw.  Parker's back along with Cynthia Nixon, Kristen Davis, and Kim Cattrall as her cohorts in  negotiating the shifting definitions of womanhood in a big, bad city.  I can't even listen to you read this.  This is upsetting.  Sounds good.  In a big, bad city. 
[01:57:30]  How long have they been off the air?  How many years to kill?  I don't know.  Four years.  Four years.  Redefining womanhood.  Guys, maybe you should stop resisting the movie.  You just might learn something.  Sorry, Iraq distracted me with an oral picture.  Iraq has the timing of teeth cancer.  Is there such a thing?  Is there such a thing?  No, I don't want to get it.  I certainly wouldn't want it.  That means he has no timing whatsoever. 
[01:58:00]  What is that?  It was funny.  Oh, all right.  Is that her?  Yeah, it's confirmed.  Is it confirmed?  Kristen Davis in a sex thing?  It's never a definite answer, but supposedly this is her sex tape.  That's pretty hot.  Yeah.  So once again, because no one heard the last line, because you like to pop up pornography at  the worst time ever, guys, maybe you should stop resisting the movie.  You just might learn something.  Learn something. 
[01:58:30]  So Peter Travis is like, you know, chill out and go see the movie.  It's educational.  No.  That's realistic, too.  It's women who never have to worry about paying bills or anything.  They just have money, the best jobs.  They can buy $12,000 shoes.  Yeah.  All the women that watch this, yeah, that's real realistic to you.  They're hags.  Yeah.  They're getting guys, they're getting like young guys that are really into them.  It's all these fat housewives eating fig newtons, trying to lose weight, watching this stupid  show. 
[01:59:00]  Why don't they make a show of reality just for fat housewives who don't have sex anymore?  They're all on like weight watchers, counting points.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Lucky Leo.  Lucky Leo.  Oh, hi.  Oh, Leo.  Leo.  All right.  Oh, he's saying that Maxim named Sarah Jessica Parker, the ugliest woman alive.  The ugliest woman alive is quite a title.  Did you hear a family guy?  I was talking to a family guy.  He goes, they put Sarah Jessica Parker on TV and her face looks like a foot. 
[01:59:30]  That's right.  We were talking earlier.  She accessorizes.  Yes.  She rotates her accessories.  The reason why she had an acorn on her head for the London premiere and she used to wear  huge flowers and stuff is to get your attention off her face.  She could put a B-29 on her head and you're definitely still going to notice.  She could put a chopped other head on her breastplate and you'd still notice that ugly mole face. 
[02:00:00]  I'm obsessed with the mole, too.  Get rid of that dumb thing.  I made my wife get rid of hers.  We said it yesterday.  Good man.  It looks like the face on Mars.  Yeah.  You know that face on Mars picture?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what a mole looks like if you zoom in.  Anything risen.  Anything.  If you got a razor and went across it and it sliced it off.  Just slice it off.  Yeah.  It needs to be cut off.  How did you mention getting a mole gone?  What is that?  And then I touched it.  What is that? 
[02:00:30]  I go, ugh.  That's all you have to say to a woman is, what is that?  What is that?  And then go, ugh.  And guess what?  That what is that thing is gone tomorrow.  Whether it's a dumb shirt, a mole, a fetus.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  All right, we got the Sex in the City trailer now.  The only reason we're playing this is because it made Anthony physically ill. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I couldn't take it.  Physically ill.  Listen to this garbage.  The music stinks immediately.  I can't take this.  It's like an old movie.  Jazz.  I can't take it.  It's this too hip for the room crap that they try to pull off of this awful movie.  They're old ladies.  Of course this is what they like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there any hip, like, music? 
[02:01:30]  Any music real people listen to at any time?  That's a motorhead, whores.  Yeah.  How about that?  Oh, Samantha.  Does she want to put on a little jazz when she gets busy with a guy?  Ugh.  Get this off, slob.  I want to listen to Metallica if I'm going to have to pound you.  Yeesh.  Let's go to Freehold.  Laura.  The Four Horsemen?  Yeah.  The one who's banging them?  Laura, go ahead.  Hey, Anthony.  Like, ten years ago, you called her the prettiest of the ugly girls. 
[02:02:00]  It's still true.  So don't give Max a minute.  All right.  So she's the prettiest of the ugly girls.  That's a great way to look at it.  Sarah Jessica Parker?  She's the prettiest of the ugly girls.  Because now I think the dark-haired girl is better than her on the show.  Now she's the...  I think you're explaining her as far as all women go.  Like, there's a category.  There's a lot of ugly women out there, and she's the prettiest of the ugly women category.  Oh.  I like that.  That's perfect.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  Or anything I said back then.  Bill, what's up? 
[02:02:30]  Hey, I thought I'd help you guys out about the hills.  My girlfriend watches this crap all the time.  Yeah.  It's a scripted show.  They try to pass off at the reality show.  Oh, one of those.  Like Laguna Beach.  Yeah.  It's about all these empty-headed Southern California teenage girls that just talk about nonsense.  Why are you on the cover of Rolling Stone?  It's a huge show.  It's big with the kids.  It's a massive show.  Okay.  Thanks, Iraq.  More porno.  Yeah.  What is that?  That's one of the girls from the hills. 
[02:03:00]  Get out of here.  Yeah.  Audrina Partridge?  All right.  We need to know more about the hills.  It's about time.  But, yeah, I think we have to kind of get into knowing what the hills are about.  Oh, yeah.  There's a...  Wow.  Wow.  She's a little...  She's just at the upper limit on the bottom half.  What do you mean?  Just at the upper...  Like, the upper limit of...  Like, it's any wider and there'd be a problem.  So...  But it's good.  You don't like...  If they can bear children, it's not good.  At all. 
[02:03:30]  You know what, though?  She's throwing a hip to the side.  Yeah, she is.  That would be a little distorted.  Don't believe me.  I am not complaining about that picture.  Sounds like you are.  No.  Sounds like you are.  Sounds like you are.  Yeah, you fruit.  All right.  I'm bad.  Is that bad, too?  No.  What's going with that picture, huh?  It's good.  She's in the water with half her ass.  Because they'll never get the smell out of all the fish.  That old gag.  Thank you.  Take my wife, please.  All right, can we get through this dumb trailer?  Yes, please. 
[02:04:00]  Ultimate kiss, goodnight.  It's the last single girl kiss.  Ew.  Ultimate single gal, Carrie Bradshaw, will be married to John James.  It's about time.  Should we get you a diamond?  No, just get me a really big closet.  That's because girls like big closets.  It helps when you have a lot of room in there.  Yes.  Perhaps I'll step out.  Oh, how hacky. 
[02:04:30]  Just give me a really big closet.  A big closet.  And all the girls go, oh, God, that's funny because she loves clothes.  For all her shoes, I bet.  Girl in the closet.  After years of living in the city, I assumed that if my friends and I ever got our fairytale endings, that would be the end of the story.  AIDS?  Hello.  Welcome home, baby.  I always knew she'd marry big.  You thought that after the second breakup?  Yep. 
[02:05:00]  After the 15th?  Uh-huh.  We broke up a lot.  But real life?  200 people?  Don't we want?  I want you.  That's what I want.  Always has a twist.  Uh-oh.  What's the twist?  Cancer?  What is it?  We've got a problem.  I got the call today.  Oh, I got the call today.  What's the...  What?  What?  What's the problem?  And why the depressing Starbucks music?  I just want a cup of coffee.  I don't need to listen to chicks singing about how sad their lives are. 
[02:05:30]  This trailer...  What happened?  ...and Starbucks and their dumb music is repulsive.  I got the call today.  I didn't want to hear.  I can't believe I was running around New York thinking I'm finally getting my happy ending.  I let the wedding get bigger than big.  What are all these voices?  Oh, boy.  Oh, I get it.  There's a problem.  Bigger than big.  Bigger than her guy.  There's a problem.  See, because she wants this big wedding.  What, like she's 22?  She's 40-something.  Stop it.  You're not a kid. 
[02:06:00]  Go to a justice of the peace.  Yeah.  Enough.  With your old haggy friends as your bridesmaids.  Just write an X on a paper as a witness.  There's no reason this woman should be talking about a wedding like she's a kid.  Some people are getting mad that we're just talking about this movie.  Oh, shut up.  It's all I want to talk about.  I'm obsessed with it.  I can't stop talking about this awful movie.  You want to hear the second part of the trailer?  Of course I do.  Can I tell you something?  Honestly, I swear to God, I like that song that we're just playing. 
[02:06:30]  I got to.  No, you don't.  I swear to God, I like that.  It's Starbucks crap.  It's not bad.  I get depressed when I go to Starbucks.  I have to hear another broad singing about how her life sucks.  That's true.  She's going to get it all together, though.  Oh, I've got it all herself.  Because she's a strong woman.  Ugh.  I've been trying to get down.  It didn't mean anything.  Oh, that's Heart of the Matter.  That's Don Henley.  A remake of Don Henley's Heart of the Matter. 
[02:07:00]  Don Henley did it fine.  India, Ari.  Leave it alone.  All right.  India, Ari.  It didn't mean anything.  It just happened once.  Oh, the guy cheated.  I'm pregnant.  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's just pregnant.  The hot one has to be pregnant.  Thanks.  Oh, they're all back together again.  You know me.  I don't really believe in marriage. 
[02:07:30]  Now, Botox, on the other hand, that works every time.  Oh, that's Samantha.  Oh, is she something?  How many pricks does this girl need?  Don't dump Botox.  You know, they use a needle.  They prick you.  Oh, right.  I get you.  I've got to explain my joke before they dump out.  Boy, is she something.  Oh, she's just unbelievable.  She's too much.  Now, Botox.  Ugh.  She's a whore, and she's okay with it, guys.  She's fine with it. 
[02:08:00]  You know, because that's kind of taboo.  You know, in the real world, they don't want to be known as a whore.  But this Samantha, she's figured out how to make it okay for everybody.  It works.  And the ladies love it.  Oh, they sit at home going, hey, I could do this, too.  And they go out and realize, no, you're going to sit at the bar, and no one's going to come up to you.  And nobody will.  Until the end of the night.  I want to see, like...  And then he'll probably kill you.  Yeah, that's what I was getting at.  I want to see someone that takes a cue from Samantha, like, I could be a whore, too.  Yeah.  Gets online. 
[02:08:30]  Beats the guy.  I'm just going to throw myself out there and be a sex object like Samantha.  Typing away in a chat room.  The next thing you know, you're in a shallow grave somewhere.  Inside of a taconic.  The college kid is backing you as a part of his frat pledge.  The lacrosse team is having their way with you.  It's not as fun as you first thought it might be.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Spoiler, Mr. Big dies in the movie.  I read it yesterday. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I did not just say that.  Oh, OB.  Oh, OB.  Oh, there's a problem.  Oh, does Mr. Big have something wrong with him?  Oh.  Oh, how wonderful.  Oh, that would be great.  Sure would be.  See, Mr. Big putting a gun in his mouth like Jack Wharton in Injustice for All.  He's sitting on the toilet.  What year did that movie come out?  1719.  What about a few good men?  Oh, my God.  Who doesn't love Jimmy?  79. 
[02:09:30]  79.  Well, that really makes me want to go see that movie.  Hey, we're not done yet.  Oh, damn it.  It's all me.  I don't really believe in marriage.  Now, Botox, on the other hand, that works every time.  Oh, you.  I can't believe you're even dressing up.  The only two choices for women, rich and sexy kitten.  Oh, and you just said a mouthful there, sister. 
[02:10:00]  Don't you say that to Kim Kardashian?  Honey, wax much?  When you're married, you have a different set of priorities.  This one's married, and she's not growing a national forest.  Oh, I got it.  You didn't let yourself go after the marriage.  Oh, that's hysterical.  She's got a big, hairy c**t.  I get it.  But it smells like Einstein's scalp.  Jesus. 
[02:10:30]  Oh, my God.  What the hell?  Forest?  Life doesn't always turn out to be your fantasy.  Oh, what happened?  That's why you need friendships that are real to get you through it all.  And Cinderella and the Prince lived happily ever after.  You know, things don't always happen like this in real life.  I just think you should know that now.  I bet you Mr. Big's a pedo, and he has to go upstate for a few years. 
[02:11:00]  They found questionable photographs on his computer.  That's the problem.  Mr. Big was his news group's name.  Mr. Big is your screen name.  Why don't you sit down over there?  Have something to drink.  You know that six years in Attica?  That's beautiful.  We found the Family Guy clip about her face looking like a foot.  The audio's coming in like crazy for this. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you, Danny.  TMZ calls Parker Frankenstein.  This is all we want to talk about for the next 16 days.  Yeah, 16 days.  Frankenstein made a rare appearance in London on Sunday.  Wait a second.  That's not Frankenstein.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  What a bitch.  Wow.  A little catty there.  Oh, that rolls.  Sarah Jessica Parker. 
[02:12:00]  She had man hands.  SJP hit the GB this weekend to promote the Sex and the City movie, where she flashed her  90-year-old hands.  What the hell?  They let Sarah Jessica Parker's face on TV, and she looks like a foot.  What in God's name has she been doing with those hands?  Building an art?  Actually, she was probably doing some gardening in order to make that hat.  You know, I think we all thought a lot about what we were going to wear.  And the best you came up with was a friggin' acorn?  Maybe I'm delusional. 
[02:12:30]  Maybe I'm delusional.  We're hoping she loses the acorn for the premiere in The Big Apple, where she'll be getting  50 tickets.  Add the 25 tickets each of the other girls are getting, and these broads are taking up  half the theater.  Read it and weep, my friends.  Maybe that's where the veins are coming from, stacking up the audience with skinny-ass people  who are actually going to laugh at the film, even if it sucks.  Oh, you just said a mouthful there, sister.  Then again, would Sarah Jessica Parker ever do a movie that sucks? 
[02:13:00]  I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up, I'm up.  For sucky movies, I guess.  I know what you want.  Bip, bip, bip.  Look at that boom.  My God, they're giant.  That turn you on?  Whip-a-bill Wednesday.  All sports all the time.  No excuses. </pre>
