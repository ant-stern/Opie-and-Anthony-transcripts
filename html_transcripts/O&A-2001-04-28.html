<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with in-studio guests Jim Norton, Jim Florentine, and Devin (Buzz from *Home Alone*).  The show was dominated by listener calls, many claiming (often falsely) to be celebrities or actors from various films and television shows.  Callers falsely claimed to be Sean Brody from *Jaws*,  "Seven" from *Married...with Children*, and various other minor characters from different productions.  Some callers did have legitimate minor roles in films like *Home Alone* and *Who's the Boss*. The hosts attempted (with varying degrees of success) to verify these claims amidst a barrage of sexually explicit and vulgar jokes, including discussions of Macaulay Culkin and allegations of child abuse.  The hosts also discussed their dislike of *The Clumps*, and a caller recounted a power outage during a *The Perfect Storm* screening.  Haywood Nelson (from *What's Happening!!) unexpectedly called in.  Extended comedic bits, impersonations, and sexually suggestive anecdotes from the hosts punctuated the show.

Rodney Dangerfield made a surprise appearance, discussing his daughter's labor. The conversation with Dangerfield was highly informal and vulgar, covering his career, friendships with other comedians (Andrew Dice Clay and Sam Kinison), films (*Caddyshack*, *Back to School*), and personal life.  The discussion frequently involved explicit descriptions of women's bodies and crude jokes about sex and drug use (using code words like "balloon knot").  Mendy, described as "big," was brought into the studio and became the subject of explicit commentary.  Otto and George, two puppet comedians, made a surprise appearance for Anthony's birthday, adding to the already chaotic and offensive atmosphere with their extremely vulgar language and interruptions.  A call from Congressman Gary Ackerman was met with highly inappropriate remarks from the puppets.  More callers, some legitimate celebrities, others not, engaged in vulgar exchanges.

A segment focused on Liz, a caller claiming to have been in Macaulay Culkin's apartment around 1999-2000, refusing to divulge details, prompting much speculation and ribald jokes.  Psycho Mark, Calvin Q. Farts (and his imposter), and several self-proclaimed celebrities (including a supposed *Sopranos* extra) also called in.  The conversation continued its trajectory into sexually suggestive and offensive territory, discussing drugs, underage encounters, and other inappropriate topics. There were numerous references to *Home Alone*, *The Sopranos*, and other popular culture.  A significant portion was dedicated to a Long Island band's experiences playing in small venues.

Jim Brewer was a guest, recounting a prank call he and a coworker made while working at Sears, impersonating Muammar Gaddafi to threaten a bomb attack on the Sears hardware department.  This prank call escalated into a real bomb threat scare, leading to a police and fire department response and a meeting with Sears management.  The story was punctuated by the hosts' crude humor, references to bodily functions, and sexually suggestive comments, contrasting Brewer's nonchalant attitude with the seriousness of the situation.  The show concluded with advertisements and station promotions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by Opie and Anthony, serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Sucks, man, from wall to wall.  1027 WNEW.  Lincoln Park, Anthony, one step closer. 
[00:00:30]  We just played the hooks on our show.  All the hooks, so we can get back to the fun.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Lots going on.  We got Jim Norton in the studio.  Jim Florentine, which is Jim Norton's roommate, also a great comic.  And a new guy, Dan, right?  Devin.  Don.  Don, I'm sorry, Don.  Just met him and screwed up his name.  That's good.  No big deal, Frank.  Good.  And we got Devin.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Who played Buzz on Home Alone. 
[00:01:00]  On Home Alone.  It was just over the weekend, I think.  I wouldn't let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass.  That's the guy.  That's the guy.  He's walking down the hall.  And I'm like, of course, that's Buzz.  He's a little older.  He's walking in or down the hallway and opens out the window and just goes,  It's the guy.  That's funny, because I walked in here and I said,  Who the hell is who?  Because I've never seen your faces before.  Well, this is all you get.  And Norton to boot.  And Norton.  You just made Stinky's day, because all of a sudden Devin goes, 
[00:01:30]  You're Stinky?  All right.  I was psyched, man.  Wait, get Stinked.  Did he make your year or what?  I've already told everyone about it.  Yeah.  The guy's in one of the top grossing movies of all time.  And he's psyched to meet Stinky.  I was psyched to meet him, man.  I was totally psyched about it, man.  I see you're still keeping your hair short.  Good.  That's the buzz.  I'm now shagged.  Right.  Hair down to his shoulders.  I'm looking at everything else here that you've done.  You have Dennis the Menace. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  Who were you in that?  I was Dennis' babysitter's boyfriend, but it's a lot bigger part than it sounds.  Mickey?  Yeah, Mickey.  Do you remember?  Okay, did any of you see the movie?  Dennis the Menace?  Yeah, you'd all be lying if you said yes.  So you can tell me no right now.  Yeah, I might have tuned in to a moment or two of them.  I saw the sequel that was straight to video release.  Did you see Macaulay's penis?  I read the comic book.  Did I dump out when I was on the phone and I talked about Macaulay with the hand? 
[00:02:30]  I don't know.  Possibly.  We'll have to look at the dump sheet.  I really want to see if I got dumped right.  Can I try and get dumped on this?  It's pretty easy, actually.  Did he get dumped when he was talking about Macaulay doing hand at the Port Authority?  You can say that.  I know you can say that.  All right, I want to try and get dumped.  Really?  That got dumped?  That didn't get dumped.  How long did it get dumped?  Handy.  Handy.  It's our hand release.  Macaulay Culkin tried tongue-tickling my yam bags.  Did I get tickled? 
[00:03:00]  Did I get dumped?  Do you get along with Macaulay?  I like to squirt my d*** on his face.  Did I get dumped yet?  Come on.  Did I get dumped?  That got dumped.  Son of an F.  I don't even know what that means.  Well, that might have got dumped.  Ah, heck.  I didn't know you were doing children's films.  Let's see.  Little Monsters.  I did Little Monsters with Hally Mandel.  Fred Savage.  Fred Savage.  Yes, indeed.  I'm just looking at the body of work here on the Internet Movie Database. 
[00:03:30]  Wonderful thing.  It lets all of our listeners lie along at home and say that they've been in movies.  We got Chip from Kate and Alley stopping by.  Nice.  Yeah.  That's cool, right?  And look at it.  Liar right there.  Which one?  Played Sean Brody in Jaws.  Hello?  Jay.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's going on?  You played Sean Brody in Jaws, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  What's your last name?  Mello. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  Any of this you could get on the movie database.  Sure.  All right.  What could you possibly tell us that isn't on the Internet Movie Database?  Let's see.  They kept me in the cage to protect me from Dreyfus.  He was a kid toucher.  All right.  All right.  I believe him.  What was the name of the shark in Jaws?  What was the name of the actual mechanical shark?  Oh, it was, uh...  Oh, Devin.  Good. 
[00:04:30]  Good.  Good.  Look at this.  Don't ask with me.  I want to go to school, buddy.  That's a good one.  Jay?  Yeah.  Are you going to admit that you're not Sean Brody?  Yeah.  Okay.  I have no idea what the name of the shark was.  It was Bruce, actually.  It wasn't Percy.  No, it was Bruce.  I'll tell you that.  It was named after Spielberg's lawyer.  After his lawyer.  Shark.  There you go.  That's Spielberg's humor.  Kills me every time.  They figured you would be inappropriate.  You can get that from the Universal Studios tour. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, Rick.  That's right.  Hey, you were a tour guide, weren't you?  I heard that, too.  As we get towards the tiny village of Amity, here's...  Uh-oh.  We're having a little trouble with the tram.  And, look, you can see the track under the water, two feet under the water.  I believe a mechanical shark is going to come up.  And scare you.  And this would be a good photo.  And as we drive behind to the Cleaver's house, you'll realize this is just a facade.  Facade means false front. 
[00:05:30]  Someone shoot me in the effing head.  That was Rick, man.  This sucks.  Our listeners are wrecking our little party we wanted to do.  I know.  I just came and showed up.  Just show up.  We kind of didn't believe him.  He says, all right, I'll come down.  And he came down and it's definitely Buzz from Home Alone.  Somebody getting a beer?  Going on a beer run?  Oh, for God's sake, sorry.  We ran out five minutes again?  How about Starbucks?  You're Irish, right?  I'm half Irish, half Scottish.  Yeah, well, you like to drink.  You like to drink.  That's a lot of hate.  I like to drink and you're buying. 
[00:06:00]  I loved you.  I always have.  I like this guy, man.  If you don't get him a beer soon, he's going to try to drink for my mule.  You're too old for him.  My God, man.  Is it mango or papaya?  Is it mango or papaya?  Can you picture him kicking Marky Mark and boogie knife?  Oh, my God.  Wow, yeah.  I love you.  I'm an effing idiot.  That's a great scene. 
[00:06:30]  Do you want to kiss me?  Hey, that's good.  Good visual, Jim.  You know, I'm going to go out and get my hair cut just like you.  And the 50th caller gets a picture of Cindy Williams' hood.  That ain't making the radio.  That's not making the radio.  That was iffy.  She was a whore.  You can't say that on the radio.  Get the pistol.  It's all right.  This radio show is a lot of fun for the people on hold.  Yeah.  You're getting jumped out a lot.  I'm really tired, but I apologize. 
[00:07:00]  That's all right.  Bill got a stiff neck.  Somebody's asking if you ever saw Macaulay's father beat the crap out of him on the set.  No, his dad liked me, actually.  His dad hated everyone else on the set, but he liked me.  Really?  Probably because I'm skoosh.  Yeah.  Yeah, he got me a tie of my family tartan.  It was my family plaid tartan, and he got me a tie of it.  With Macaulay's money.  Great.  Good guy.  I sent him back a whopping 12 bucks.  There's a gift.  And in return, I set his apartment on fire. 
[00:07:30]  I was at that apartment.  I'm so not surprised that apartment was party.  It was party.  The election, wasn't it?  He had to step over mattresses and empty 40 bottles.  Nice.  There's graffiti on the wall.  I mean, I dug the place.  I mean, I would have done the same thing if I had my own place.  There was really graffiti on the wall?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was big mosaics and stuff.  Well, I don't know.  It wasn't like, you know, Jackson Pollock or anything.  But, you know, it was, yeah, it was actual mosaics and stuff.  And you walked in, there's constant, look, the wall smelled of smoke. 
[00:08:00]  The good smoke, I should say.  Wow.  Party house.  Yeah.  Is there a picture of Macaulay trying to touch a hairy banana?  I'm calling for the biggest celebrity.  Hey, did you ever see Ford Bailey?  I was Ford Bailey.  I can take you.  Danny.  Hi.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Hi.  Hi.  And who are you? 
[00:08:30]  I used to be, well, I'll give you a hint.  I used to be on Who's the Boss?  Oh, you must have been a long time.  Were you the gay one?  Well, I wasn't back then.  But, you know, you grow up and you find new things out.  And after you're molested by Judith for a few years, you know.  Oh, very good.  Well, yeah.  I'm Danny Pintaro.  Yeah, the people are picking up pure celebrities to try to trick us.  Thank you.  Danny Pintaro.  Later, Hammer. 
[00:09:00]  Later, Hammer.  Danny Pintaro.  Wait a minute, he must have been in Homo Alone.  Yeah, hey, look at that, Devin.  That goddamn, people are effing with us now.  Just the weirdest, I played Robert Shaw's ball bag and the chicken to tell him what he's  made.  And then we'd ask him questions to try to confirm it.  All right, if you're a real celebrity and you're listening to our show or you're a listener  of the show, please give us a call like Devin did from Homo Alone.  Yeah, come on.  Thank you.  Be cool.  We're having fun. 
[00:09:30]  This guy's claiming to be seven from Marriage with Children.  What?  Who?  Hey, Shane.  Yeah.  Shane.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  How you doing?  You were seven?  Yes, I was.  How can you prove it?  I can tell you other stuff I was in.  I know I was on the show for only one year, one season before it dumped out of my head.  What was Ed O'Neill packing?  Ed O'Neill packing?  Yeah.  Not much, I'll tell you that much.  So you were the kid that came in at the end when it was pretty much ruined, married,  ruined the show like Oliver did for the Brady's.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  More or less, that was me.  I was the loser.  And what was the name of the shark?  Bruce.  It is him.  Oh, my God.  Seven, look out.  Oliver.  Yeah, this is kind of hard to confirm.  This game just sucks now.  Because now everybody has a computer.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  All right, name a film you were in.  I did a voice for Toy Story.  It wasn't a main voice.  I did an extra voice.  What voice? 
[00:10:30]  Well, it was just an extra character in the background.  It didn't actually have a part.  But I was in a Rockford Files episode.  You were what?  I played a boy named Zeke.  You could be looking this up when you were in Rockford Files.  He's got everything and only everything.  What did you do on the Rockford Files as Zeke?  I gave the main guy.  The main guy.  I have a question.  The main guy.  I love that.  Well, I don't think Shane's for real, Anthony. 
[00:11:00]  You know James Gandolfini.  You know the guy from the Rockford Files.  I did the voice of a guy with cancer on the Bruckner Expressway into the Bronx.  What's your question, Shane?  I was wondering if you can get Gary Coleman to stay on the line for a long time today.  He's still on hold.  We're going to get to him after commercials.  Of course.  All right, Shane.  What are you talking about, Opie?  This sucks.  I know.  People were right when we started.  We could get more cool people in like Devin from Hollywood. 
[00:11:30]  If you guys wouldn't F with us.  Is this a guy on line, too?  What is it?  Is this a little story that was happening?  Yeah, did you happen?  You went to high school with Sarah Michelle Gellar?  She went to the school.  Not my year.  Jennifer Aniston also went and Wesley Snipes.  These were my brothers here.  That's what I hear.  You get in any of their, you know,  anything else you get Wesley Snipes.  Just Wesley in the boys' locker room.  He recorded me during Freshman Friday because he's older than me.  That's funny.  He loves his pooey.  My forehead. 
[00:12:00]  He's a pooey.  Beto in black.  Look, Haywood Nelson's calling in from what's happening.  Oh, you got it?  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Please put him on.  Haywood Nelson.  Haywood.  Hello.  This is Haywood Nelson.  How y'all doing?  Hello.  Hello.  What's the lion's ass?  I ain't lying.  This sounds real.  Hey, Haywood, what happened to Mabel King's legs  after they cut them off because of diabetes?  Oh.  Yeah, pretty funny.  Pretty funny. 
[00:12:30]  Pretty funny.  Haywood.  Haywood.  That's what it sounds like.  Hey, man.  Take care, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  God damn it.  I like how he was black and had to put a black voice on.  I know exactly.  Yeah, he was a black guy.  And he's like, hello.  Hello now.  I'm a black guy.  All right, man.  All right, not really me.  Take it easy, man.  We have the kid that was Jeremy in the Pearl Jam video checking out.  Yeah.  Yeah, sure we do.  It sucks.  You guys get a job. 
[00:13:00]  You guys are ruining it.  That's bluff.  Mary Kate Olsen from Full House.  Oh, God.  I don't care.  Put her on anyway.  Please, for the love of God.  Yeah, we can pretend.  Just make believe.  Liz, though, is calling in.  She was at McCall Culkin's apartment.  Yeah.  Dude, did he have a poster of himself hanging on his bedroom door like he did a couple years ago?  I was not aware of any poster of himself.  So he didn't have it back then?  No, but, you know, he could have put it on.  Could you step out of the wind tunnel that you're in? 
[00:13:30]  All right, I'm on a K-phone.  It's really, really windy.  It's a volcano.  Hey, Liz.  Yeah.  Where are you?  Where am I?  Yeah.  I'm on Houston and Broadway.  I'm on the peak of K-2.  It's really windy down there.  Take off your pants and let's hear a whistle.  So what were you doing in Macaulay's apartment, Liz?  I actually cannot say.  Sorry.  All right.  Come on.  All right.  I'm his big brother. 
[00:14:00]  Come on.  You can tell me anything.  Can we play what?  No, I really cannot say how I have been in the apartment.  Can we play what was?  It's pretty crazy.  The bathroom, there's like no last face.  Well, before it burnt down.  Can we play what was Liz doing in Macaulay Culkin's apartment?  Oh, can we play that?  No.  You were either selling him dope or bobbing for dignity.  I was going to say something similar, but that was so much more creative. 
[00:14:30]  That was almost sanctuary.  They're awful.  Hilarious.  Is she still on the line?  Liz.  Yeah, I'm here.  All right.  I'm just trying to cover up the phone so I can actually hear you.  Okay.  What year were you there?  Was it around like 97, 98?  It was 99, 2000.  Okay.  Those were the lame years.  97, 98.  It was happening at that apartment.  Yeah.  That's what I was doing.  It wasn't my money.  99, 2000.  He was just into wrestling then. 
[00:15:00]  Did he still have video games in his apartment?  Yeah.  He had like one pinball machine.  And one regular video game?  I think he just had a pinball machine at that point.  Okay.  He only saw the pinball machine.  He was straddled on that.  Oh, wait.  That wasn't his camera.  That was being cute.  No.  That deaf, dumb, and blonde kid sure plays a mean pinball.  Liz?  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we'll let you go if you're not going to share with us. 
[00:15:30]  You've got to tell us.  Tell us what happened.  Yeah.  What were you doing there?  It was nothing that you guys are thinking about.  It was totally innocent.  But no one knows you, and you're probably using a fake name anyway.  Yeah.  Come on.  What did you do?  I did nothing.  Maybe.  Maybe she was there for Kieran.  I am a medically wreck.  Maybe you were there to meet with Kieran Culkin.  Because he's kind of a hottie now, I hear.  Oh, really?  I didn't meet him yet.  I liked him back then when he was eight.  I know him, and I've just been there.  Come on, Liz.  Tell us.  It's nothing bad. 
[00:16:00]  It's totally innocent.  So tell us.  It's not even anything important.  So let's just say it.  Then make up something important by this point, for God's sake.  All right.  We're going to let you go.  All right.  Sorry, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Oh, she was horrible.  Windy call with melting wine.  She's a filthy whore.  I was just trying to say that.  I'm sorry.  She was a whore.  She was a whore.  Well, you're trying to imitate Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Oh, fuck.  It's a whore appointment. 
[00:16:30]  Look at the Home Alone guy doing Psycho Mark.  You're a filthy whore.  You're a filthy whore.  You know, we found a new friend.  Kevin, you come by every time.  Oh, man.  That makes me so happy.  Do you still get recognized?  All the time.  Yeah.  Even with the hair and a little older.  How many of those, though, are for Boogie Nights?  Oh, my God.  Do people actually think you're the guy?  I was in the theater seeing Twister.  Memorial Day weekend a couple years ago.  Lady stands up from behind me. 
[00:17:00]  She's like, you was in a movie.  I was like, yeah.  Yeah, I was.  What color was she?  The same color as the guy on the phone.  He was from, you was in a movie.  You spit in Miss Kizzy's bathroom.  I was like, yeah, yeah.  So, yes, I was in a movie.  Yes, you are.  You are correct, man.  She's like, you was in Twister.  I was like, no, I was not in Twister.  And she's like, Boogie Nights.  Yes, he was.  This is before Boogie Nights came out. 
[00:17:30]  She's like, yes, he was.  And even my mom leaned over.  She's like, you do look like him.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  He's correct.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, did you almost say it?  And then she said, no, I'm kidding, man.  No, man.  It was a joke, man.  I was in good times, man.  I do want to say it.  I don't mind.  And it's like a Mark's checking in.  I think he's flattered.  He's ripped off by a celebrity.  You got nothing, baby.  I'm taking your show to Broadway.  What a ball is.  I'm just sitting here listening. 
[00:18:00]  This is a trip.  It's fun.  I've been sitting in my bathroom listening to you for years, Psycho Mark.  I just want to let you know.  I was so sad they let you go, man.  Were your pants around your ankles?  Jesus Christ.  That's good.  That's funny.  I'll have to pull some tubes.  I'll have to come by.  We'll get to take you to roll up a fatty.  Yes.  Come on by, man.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Marky.  Marky, come on by.  Yeah, I'll stop by.  I wish I was a celebrity.  I could come by. 
[00:18:30]  All right, man.  I'm afraid.  I'm playing him.  Take it easy, Mark.  You just made his day and made his head even bigger.  Oh, man.  That's good.  That's all right, John.  Let's go to Q Farts Calvin.  Calvin.  Hello.  What's up, Calvin?  Yes, it's Calvin Q Farts.  He's brother.  Yeah.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Hey, Buzz, I just want to tell you, man.  Honestly, you've been my favorite actor since I was a kid.  You're kidding.  Yeah.  All my friends are like, you know, why isn't Mel Gibson your favorite actor?  You know, someone else, Kurt Russell or someone gay like that. 
[00:19:00]  But honestly, you're the best.  That's awesome.  Thank you very much.  That's so weird to hear.  Yeah, well, really, though.  I don't know about the name Bevin.  You're really a Buzz.  There's no Bevin in this.  All right.  Well, people have been calling me that for a while.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  You know, I have an imposter.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I have somebody who walks around saying they're me.  Is it you?  No.  Oh, you're kidding.  Definitely not.  I really do.  No.  Somebody came up, this hot girl came up to me.  She was like, you were at Dangerfields last week.  I was like, no, I've never been in that club before in my life.  It was a couple years ago. 
[00:19:30]  And she was like, oh, I thought you were in there.  Later on, I see her talking to her boyfriend.  She's like, that's the guy who came up and said, I was in Home Alone.  He was all over me.  He was like, he is nasty.  I've never been in there.  I've never seen it before in my life.  Wait a minute.  Are you sure?  Was he also a guy from Chicago where they found 33 bodies under his house?  And he painted clowns?  No, it was not John Wayne.  Oh, my goodness.  A John Wayne Gacy reference?  Always appropriate.  Wow.  All right, Calvin.  We've got to let you go, okay?  All right.  Thanks a lot. 
[00:20:00]  I appreciate it.  You guys take care.  All right.  Look at all these celebrities calling in.  Me.  Someone claiming to be Wilson from Castaway.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  No one showed up for the whipped cream bikini contest today.  We're pathetic.  Are you kidding?  You guys have not asked me yet once.  I just want to let you know.  No one has showed up.  Ladies, do you want to kiss me?  Martin, get undressed.  You're way too old for me.  I'm sorry.  I didn't even wait for them to take the rubber band off their retainers anymore. 
[00:20:30]  I swear to God.  Oh, God.  I come from young.  If they're not lisping, they're not sexy.  Exactly.  Yeah.  We've got that snap mouth action.  Hey, where's Chip from Kate and Alley?  I don't know.  Where is he?  Hey, Rick.  Did it sound like he was going to stop down?  Rick is so much better looking than I thought he would be.  Oh, Rick.  That's a good shot, right?  I don't know, you know.  Rick is now backing out of the door. 
[00:21:00]  Backing out of the room, Rick.  Well, you know, we're in the film business.  We're very liberal, you know, this whole...  You can do that.  Yeah, you can do stuff like that.  Sure enough with your masculinity where you can say another man is attractive and still  be a flaming faggot.  Yeah, exactly.  Did I say that?  Yeah, don't.  How's that for a chopper?  The immortal.  Charles Nelson, right.  Well, I don't say anything about you guys.  I just said about me.  Well, because you haven't seen him stand up yet. 
[00:21:30]  Rick's feet do look nice tonight.  I'm just saying.  We're going into the gay zone.  I mean, he does have a wedding ring, but, you know, a lot of gay guys wear the wedding  ring.  The beard.  The deterrent.  The beard.  Take it off in the clubs, down in the village, in front of the glory halls, wherever.  Got to take it off.  Now, some places don't have the glory halls.  They just have the window.  No, no.  Look, don't touch. 
[00:22:00]  Now, were you going to say the Port Authority?  I was going to bring that up.  I heard you mentioned it.  I quite got to look at my mule in Port Authority.  Absolutely true.  I'm sorry.  I said I'm sorry.  How many times do you want me to apologize for that?  You got to bring the shopping bag with you into the Port Authority bathroom so the  eight-year-old kid could stand in the shopping bag so that when the cops look underneath,  it's just you sitting on the ball and they see a shopping bag.  The eight-year-old kid is in there.  And they wonder.  Right.  Just some helpful hints.  Why?  Well, I thought we were all having fun.  Does anyone have a pen?  I got to write that down.  And then you can carry them out. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  The shopping bag.  Then you explain, why is your blood leaking out of the bottom of the bag?  Yeah.  Thank you.  Who's getting hurt?  Get one of those Bloomingdale big brown bags.  Give that kid a lifetime of memories.  Because I like them plump.  A lifetime of memories.  The backsides are so soft and pink.  I know.  Second course.  Is somebody getting burped in the fall?  You want paper or plastic?  Whatever holds an eight-year-old.  Just give it to me. 
[00:23:00]  That's funny.  Oh, this is horrible.  Plastic for the mouth.  I can't yell.  Turn blue.  You're going to need the plastic anyway.  So just go straight to it, you know?  And some duct tape.  Oh, my God.  And they make you feel so big when they're that young.  Damn, I can't.  Punch out, man.  Punch out.  A lifetime of memories.  I just realized how out of my league I am with these professionals. 
[00:23:30]  You have to be just as horrible as anyone else.  I've got so much more to learn, though.  I mean, you guys really...  No.  You have to sweat on your forehead.  You're built to be a pedophile.  Norton is truly the Yoda of pedophilia.  He will teach you.  That's funny.  Screw or screw not.  There is no track.  The perversion is strong in this one.  Dissociate.  You will. 
[00:24:00]  You're a son of a bitch.  You're up in mind.  You've got to pull a diaper off in no time.  I'm not afraid.  You will be.  That's funny.  Come into the store.  You will be.  You must put him in this bag, you must.  Yoda, how's this?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no. 
[00:24:30]  Suck it.  I was at home alone, little boy.  I can get you the DVD copy.  These are not the children you're looking for.  Oh, my God.  I can't take my head down.  All right.  You're going to be killing me.  Luke, I am your father who touched you.  Luke, I am your father.  I know, Dad.  What are you doing?  No, Luke, I am your father.  Just a little fellow with a mouthful of confusion. 
[00:25:00]  And then even if it made the air.  Some of it made the air.  It probably did.  Wow.  Mouthful of a gene pool.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  All right.  Oh, why?  I don't get it.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Opie.  I feel a scene in the media.  And Anthony.  I like the illiterate, ignorant type type.  You're definitely brain damage.  You have no idea. 
[00:25:30]  It's all in theory.  Survival of a finish.  You should not be alive.  Anyone else getting dumber in here?  Oh.  1027-WNEW.  The Sports Guys.  You give us sports with a twist.  Yeah.  Like hanging out with the boys.  Like you're hanging with us at the bar or on the corner.  It's very intimate.  You know what I mean?  Not in a faggy way.  Right.  We're talking sports.  We're busting jobs.  It's a great show.  Wayne, your brother's never been more right.  By the way, what did that cost us?  Just an O.A. t-shirt. 
[00:26:00]  The Sports Guys.  Mornings.  5 to 9.  1027-WNEW.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027-WNEW.  Fat boy play.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  Boop, boop.  We were checking out Liquid Todd. 
[00:26:30]  Ben threw a little birthday party for himself.  You threw a birthday party for yourself, right, Ben?  Because no one else was going to.  Ben turned the big 2-5, what, a week ago now?  Whoa, whoa.  And he got Liquid Todd to spin at his...  Whoa, whoa.  The guy's got some skills.  Yeah.  He's got some skills.  Whoa, whoa.  All right, you got some...  Whoa, whoa.  Are you making your own mix over the Fat Boy Slim mix? 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  There hasn't been there.  Whoa, whoa.  I'm gay.  Whoa, whoa.  I'm gay.  I'm gay.  I'm gay.  In bifacto.  Yeah, shut up, Ted.  In bifacto.  Yeah.  But you did see the clumps this weekend. 
[00:27:30]  Yes, unfortunately, I went to see the clumps.  Oh, this is...  Now, from the commercials, it looks vaguely amusing, didn't it?  Didn't it look somewhat amusing?  Well, the clumps in the first movie were very entertaining.  Yeah, and there wasn't really a lot of them in the first one.  No, they were just in the film enough...  Right.  ...to get some laughs.  Well, now Eddie Murphy's decided to do everything.  Everything.  He's like every part in this thing, except for Janet Jackson, which is, you know... 
[00:28:00]  Boy, any reality factor at all is blown away.  I'll sooner accept that a big fat guy made a life...  The Fountain of Youth formula than I will this big fat slob going out with Janet Jackson.  Unbelievable.  But it was horrible.  And you ever been to a movie where the first three minutes of the movie, you're watching it,  and you go, uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Everyone can name the film.  Deuce Bigelow. 
[00:28:30]  Oh, you saw that?  Yes, I did.  Deuce Bigelow, male gigolo.  You know, and you paid the $8.50, $9, whatever, and within the first three minutes, you're like,  Oh, no.  This is going to be a long evening.  Oh, I've made a grave error.  You don't have the ball to just walk out, because you're convinced that it's just going to get better.  Well, the beginning of the clumps, some kind of wedding scene, you know.  Oh, and there's the big fat guy.  And Eddie Murphy, as Buddy Love, comes popping out of his fly, like his head, and going, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:29:00]  And it just wasn't funny.  Uh-oh.  And I'm like, okay, this is the opening gag, and it blows.  And the movie just went downhill from there.  One funny scene in the whole movie, and that's when the entire clump family goes to an all-you-can-eat buffet,  and they just clean it out.  And it's, you know, the jokes back and forth.  The professor guy, whatever his name is, his brother character is really funny. 
[00:29:30]  But there's, you know, not too much of him.  And the story is stupid.  The jokes are really, like, lame.  They go for, like, really obvious fart jokes and stuff that are stupid.  It was a bad effing movie.  You just described our show.  Oh, yeah, I did.  I did.  That's right.  You just described our show.  I'm getting scared.  Oh, no. 
[00:30:00]  It made $43 million over the weekend?  What, did everyone go see it?  Oh, man.  It sucked.  It sucked.  It sucked.  It was really bad.  Yeah.  It just wasn't really funny.  My review, two thumbs down.  Two thumbs down.  Didn't like the clumps.  Waste of money.  Waste of time.  And from the first three minutes, you know.  It's over.  It's over, Johnny.  Well, Ann, I almost went to see the clumps last night. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  And I wish I did.  Oh, really?  I wish I did.  Why?  What did you see?  I went and saw The Perfect Storm.  No.  Wait.  I liked The Perfect Storm.  Oh, I'd love to know what happened.  Mm-hmm.  No effing idea.  I read the book, so I know, but I would like to see it in movie form.  Mm-hmm.  The movie stopped four times.  Why did it stop?  So I wish I was seeing The Clumps, because it would have gave me a reason to get out of  my seat and finally leave. 
[00:31:00]  But I was interested in this movie.  So what happens?  You're watching it.  I'm going to need you.  And what did it just go?  I'm going to need your impressions, Anthony.  Movies going on.  You know the shark scene?  Yeah.  Awesome.  Yeah.  Right after that, the movie.  It doesn't stop.  It slows down.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And then also there's an advertisement on the screen for laser eye surgery.  I'm like, what the F is going on? 
[00:31:30]  So a guy comes running in and said, hey, there's a storm on the way, which he was serious  about, as we're watching the perfect storm.  And I guess they had a power surge down there in Huntington at the movie theater, Anthony.  A power surge.  So it screwed up the movie.  So then they started up again.  Did everyone applaud?  Yeah.  And it took like five minutes and stuff.  Do you want to smack people in the head that applaud at the movie theater for anything?  Oh, yeah.  I like when a movie ends and they're all, just one by one. 
[00:32:00]  The best is because I like going to movies, you know, late night, no one's around and  stuff, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Because unlike you, I can't handle people in the theater.  Yeah.  I don't even want to be, you know, in that situation.  So the movie stops the first time.  You hear a lady in the hallway, because there's like six to eight theaters going, oh, my God,  all the movies stopped.  And we're all yelling in our theater like, no, S, you're allowed.  Ah.  So then they start the movie up again.  And then it's the scene where the guy gets dragged into the water in the middle of the 
[00:32:30]  ocean with a hook.  Yeah.  What an awesome scene.  Swear to God, in the middle of that scene.  And now the people are going like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Ah.  Now we're getting irritated.  Then on the screen, oh, your jujeebies up at the projectionist booth.  And all of a sudden on the screen pops up an ad for a Cadillac dealership on Long Island.  I'm like, Jesus.  Coca-Cola standards.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  That's Forrest Gump.  He said it's a big Coke bottle sitting on the park bench.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Coca-Cola standards.  Do you have everyone memorized?  Did they make one set of those and just distribute them around?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Working titles.  Yeah.  And then it starts up again.  And now it only went another five minutes and boom.  Friday the 13th, part five was filmed in the summer. 
[00:33:30]  In order to make it look like autumn, leaves were painted different colors and scattered around  the yard.  A little movie trivia for you.  Don't forget, Century 21 real estate, there's that old hag's effing face I'm going to look  at 15 more times before I see the movie.  So the thing I want to say about this, Anthony, so finally we gave up.  It stopped three times, not four.  They finally come in and say, hey, there's power surges all over the area. 
[00:34:00]  Unfortunately, we're just going to call it quits.  You could get, this is the funny thing.  You could get your free pass as you exit the door.  Free pass?  So you're made out.  What are you complaining?  No, it's not a free pass.  I saw not even half of Perfect Storm.  So I've been inconvenienced, right?  Right.  So the movie theater is trying to make good, right?  Oh, it's a replacement pass.  All it is is a pass so you can come back and see the other half of the movie, which is  going to be an inconvenience because then you've got to sit through the first hour of 
[00:34:30]  the Perfect Storm, which is kind of slow because they're setting up the story.  I thought you meant they gave you, like, a free admission to another movie after you  finished seeing the movie you paid for.  What they should have done, yes, Anthony, is give us two free passes.  One, because we were inconvenienced and we still want to see the end of Perfect Storm.  Yeah.  And then another pass to enjoy another fine movie at their fine movie theater for being  inconvenienced.  That would be stopped three times.  Yeah, that would be a free pass.  Right.  You're not getting anything free.  You're getting what you paid for on the first place.  Right. 
[00:35:00]  Which was one big cluster F.  But see, if it was the clumps, I would have said, thank God.  Yeah.  And I wouldn't even have taken the free pass.  I would have said, you were doing me a favor.  Thank you.  I'm out of here.  Evan, on line four, we have a bunch of tools that listen to us some days.  Evan, don't ruin Perfect Storm ending.  Evan, I didn't see the end of the movie.  That's the whole point of this break. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, you ruined the end of the OPC in the movie movie.  I didn't know he didn't see the end of the movie.  Let's go to Rich on line two.  Rich, what's going on?  You know, the same thing happened to me when I went to go see Gladiator.  We got an hour and a half into the movie theater, into the movie, and the fire alarms went off.  After the fire alarms go off, the guy comes in and he tells us, don't anyone go anywhere.  It's been happening all day.  He forgets to stop the movie and it burnt on us. 
[00:36:00]  Really?  An hour and a half into the movie and the thing burnt.  Wow.  I got an even better story.  Independence Day.  We went there to the Comac movie theater.  And there was a fire, Anthony.  The theater was packed.  I mean, every seat was taken.  It was the first weekend of Independence Day, okay?  You have the worst time, man.  Oh, no, I got three stories.  I have never been, I tell you, aside from certain ethnic groups being very loud and interrupting 
[00:36:30]  my movie experience, I've never had movies like peter out on me for an equipment problem.  Man on the Moon petered out on us as well.  What?  Swear to you.  Swear to you.  That was frustrating because then I'm thinking, all right, they're doing this on purpose.  They're doing an Andy Kaufman type thing where the movie stops.  Ah.  They're just playing with the audience.  I was convinced they were doing it on purpose because it stopped so many times when I saw it.  But listen, so I'm seeing Independence Day a couple summers ago.  Yeah.  Packed theater, first weekend, every seat taken, even the ones where you have to go, you know,  look way up like this to see the theater, okay?  Right. 
[00:37:00]  There is a full-fledged fire going on in the lobby.  One of the popcorn machines is completely engulfed in flames.  You can hear the fire trucks coming.  You can hear the fire trucks coming.  Engine 51, squad 51.  We've got a fire in the movie theater.  Yeah, where did Alfie go?  There's a big problem.  I don't get it either. 
[00:37:30]  Engine 51, squad 51, respond to the movie theater.  The popcorn machine is fully involved.  I'm with my brother-in-law Fish.  He can back me up on this one.  So, we're in the theater.  Full-fledged fire, popcorn machine, in flames, engulfed.  There is smoke coming into our theater during Independence Day.  A guy runs into the theater to tell us there's a fire. 
[00:38:00]  They open the exit doors to the left and the right of the screen, and there it is.  There's freedom right there.  No one got up.  They didn't want to lose their place in the movie, and they didn't want to lose their fine seat, Anthony.  No one got up.  It takes a lot to get people out of the movie theater when it's crowded and you found a good seat.  Right.  You really don't want to give it up.  Smoke billowing into the theater.  A shitty exit gets hairy.  I'll run.  And you hear the engines in the background. 
[00:38:30]  I think everyone was hoping that, you know, the fire trucks would come, put out the fire quickly enough, and we could enjoy the rest of the movie.  But then, finally, people got the hit when they turned the lights on, even though the movie was still playing.  The popcorn machine's on fire.  I'm not getting up.  No one got up. 
[00:39:00]  It was hilarious.  No one got up.  Buddy, did you yell fire?  No.  See, now you would have been able to do that.  Tim, what's going on?  Yeah, one time I went to the movies.  Remember that movie Uncommon Valor?  Of course.  All right, so I'm watching the movie, and the sound goes off on the movie.  So the projectionist sticks his head out the little hole up on the wall, and starts saying the lines.  The people are mouthed on the lines on the movie.  He's saying the lines on the movie.  Thinking that would be good enough, right? 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, you know, so there, you're done.  Don't worry.  You don't have to worry about it.  All right, man.  I'll talk to you later.  That's funny, man.  Remember this?  Emergency, right?  Follow Opie to the movie theater.  We have a problem.  There's molten jujubes going down the counter.  There's a poor, retarded person working the concession trying to put it out with a Coke tap. 
[00:40:00]  Boy, they are the slowest mother effers in the world at the movie theater.  That has got to be the absolute bottom rung of service ever, ever, anywhere, ever, ever, ever.  It is like, you could stand there with three people online and wait a half hour.  I beg to differ.  No, I will go with movie concession person as being the slowest possible service you can ever get in your life. 
[00:40:30]  It's insane.  I'm talking, you've got two people in front of you, you're sitting there a half hour, and they're not done with the first person.  Give them the effing popcorn.  Give them their huge vat of soda.  Give them the giant thing.  Yeah, and they can't make change, and they're all stupid.  They disappear.  I've seen them disappear on that magic little door.  The popcorn's right here.  The soda's here.  They disappear.  The magic little door.  They're all cross-eyed looking.  Oh, my God, what are you? 
[00:41:00]  What are you?  And they're trying to ring it up, and the cat registers in hieroglyphics because they can't even press numbers.  It's a picture of popcorn where the popcorn is.  You see that?  Popcorn.  That popcorn.  Condog.  Condog.  Effer.  Effer.  That's a word.  That's 10R3.  You're like, oh, no, an 03.  Oh, this is a problem.  This is a problem.  I'm giving them a 20.  10R3.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Let me give you three cents, but now that's three cents more.  Now it's 10R6.  No, no, no. 
[00:41:30]  You don't.  They're absolute retards.  Let me call the manager.  I'm going to call the manager.  No, no, it's easy.  Look, just.  Okay, look.  Look.  Just give me.  Here's 10.  Okay?  And I'll give you the three cents, and you just give me.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Metro car lady.  Slower, I'm telling you.  No.  You haven't ridden the subways in a while, Anthony.  No.  You know something?  But when I have.  Are we spoiling your day?  When I have ridden the subways.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  I've gotten a prompt service.  This has never happened in the movie theater.  I can walk up, and then you see, you see the line next to you doing the dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  The conga line?  You're like, oh, that guy that's getting served now got online like half hour after me.  Now I'm going to jump ship  I'm leaving my line  I'm leaving my line  I'm leaving my line  No, no, you never leave the line  What happened?  No, the other one  Rick's got a funny story about that 
[00:42:30]  What, jumping ship?  Before I discovered  You never jumped ship  Before I discovered the monthly pass for the Long Island Railroad  I decided that I needed to buy my ticket  Every night on the way home  I had some weird strategy  I don't know what it is to this day  But I don't know  I didn't want to be half  I don't know what it was  But I decided to buy my ticket on the way home  Every night at Penn Station  Rick watched me play the conga line game 
[00:43:00]  To the point where I started pulling out my hair  And I screamed in front of about 200 people  And he became the cursing guy  Shut up!  Shut up!  He was the cursing guy  Oh, no, you're not the cursing guy  There's only one guy  Oh, the upset cursing guy  Just like you  There's like five or six people in front of me  Getting their tickets or whatever  And the other one  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun  I'm like, okay, I'm going to go over here  You ever lose ground jumping ship? 
[00:43:30]  Yes!  You lose ground  Hey, wait!  I have three people  Now there's five!  I lost ground!  How did it happen?  So I moved to the conga line  And now there's a lady  Oh, she was overcharged for her trip to Mineola  She needs a validation for 75 cents  This could take 10 minutes  Yeah, when you see them pull out paperwork  Oh, no  Oh, no  It's going to be a problem  Paperwork!  Yeah  So then I moved over to the other line 
[00:44:00]  But the thing is  This has been going on  It was going on for about nine months  The day Ope started taking the train  I go, hey  If you're going to be doing this  You know, a few times a week  Over the course of the month  You're going to save yourself some cash  Pick up your monthly ticket  He goes, ah, no  You know, I don't  So if he doesn't get it online  I see him pulling out his wad of cash  Because he's in the action  He's always borrowing money from me  Shut up!  So he could  Yeah, he doesn't buy those either  So he could  He could buy a ticket online 
[00:44:30]  I just got his mic off  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh  Shut your mic off  There you go  This guy's got a point  How do you get to the good part?  What's the good part?  So he's  Cursing guy  He's got one person in front of him  And he figures  This is going to be quick  We've got ten minutes until the train  The train is on its last call  Nine minutes later  Ope is standing 
[00:45:00]  Still waiting  As this  This large  Large woman  Is in front  Filling out her paperwork  For her 75 cent credit  Oh, no  Dude, he was out of his  Effing mind  You were a screaming guy  He was screaming  Cursing guy  Oh, you were a cursing guy  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  I'm a loud, obnoxious guy  When I have to be  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  The last month  You know what he does?  He goes  He goes, Rick  Look what I got  He pulls out his ticket 
[00:45:30]  Like it's this major thing  I was like  It was so easy  I got it from a machine  I was like, look, Rick  Look what I discovered  You could get a monthly pass  Ah  The monthly  Saved you a lot of hassle  This guy  Wait, not only did I  Buy my ticket every night  For the train  I would also buy  A token every night  Right  Oh, no  MetroCard  Duh  But, you know  I finally  You know  I finally got an easy pass  I had been  At the battery tunnel 
[00:46:00]  Every day  With just, like, morons  That can't figure out  How to put money  Into something  Or a guy's hand  Or get change  They're trying to pay  With Drachma  Or something  And I'm behind him  Every time  It's like, yeah  Oh, I love the guy  That rolls the window down  And you see  From the back window  He does that little  Lean up  That he's going  In his pocket  What the hell  Were you doing  You were online  For ten minutes  You've been on  Straight away  To the tunnel  Plenty of time 
[00:46:30]  To dig into your pocket  And he's like  Oh, is that change  I got that right here  Somewhere under my  Left testicle  Let me dig deep  So I finally  Got the easy pass  Or the better one  Is when he gives  The guy the money  And then you realize  Oh, he didn't give him enough  Oh, no, he doesn't have it  Oh, look, he dropped it  Now he's opening his door  And looking under his car  Please, Carl  Roll ahead and crush his head  Right  Please crush his head  Blockbuster on Saturday nights  Yep  That's another one  I gotta get  Because I think  The same people  Work together  Work in the movie  Theater concessions

To hear she's in Cum Laude, through the voice of the flag,  and in the back of the mountain category. 
[02:06:30]  That's what she's going to do.  She ain't've ever been dead.  Her body's so amazing.  I know she còn all along.  It's the O&A show.  That was nice.  That was real nice, right?  It loves Rob Zombie.  I love this whole concept now.  Just play the hooks, the song.  Man, why waste time playing the whole song? 
[02:07:00]  Right.  You give everyone a little taste, they get into a bit, into it, and then we get back to the silliness.  It's like just watching the last 20 minutes of Home Alone.  Only the funny stuff, you know?  Right.  Why not?  We're in the studio with Jim Norton and also Devin, who played Buzz on Home Alone.  Home Alone.  We put the word out today.  We wanted celebrities to call up, be called up, and we invited them down.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  Just with you guys, and I heard everything. 
[02:07:30]  It was beautiful.  Loved it.  Oh, they didn't dump out of much of that?  No.  Nice.  We got hold?  Excellent.  Yeah, were you on hold?  Because that's different.  No.  All right.

Okay.  I mouth-f***ed Macaulay Culkin.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  You can't say you mouth-assed Macaulay Culkin.  What?  What?  What are these new FAA rules? 
[02:08:00]  They're ridiculous.  I don't think they have one.  Dang it.  The FAA rules have something.  The goddamn German's got nothing to do with it.  Hey, boy, where's Sheriff Brantford?  Nice.  That's an attention-getter.  You sound a little taller on radio.  Excuse me, nice lady.  Nice ass.  I want a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pep and make it snappy. 
[02:08:30]  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Diablo sandwich.  Robert Downey Jr. arrested again.  They call him troubled actor.  Isn't this just like mother-effing effed-up actor?  Troubled maybe the first time.  He's back in jail, or he's at a rehab now.  But this could be three strikes against him in California, which means, as Jay Moore says,  because I wouldn't want to steal anything he does.  Why? 
[02:09:00]  He says, do not underestimate the psycho factor in my head, right?  No, no, no, Jay told me he said that.  What are you talking about?  He blew my one line on Conan.  Robert Downey Jr. is going to be backing into big black rolls of tar paper.  Ah, that is a Jay Moore original.  What's the story?  Arrested Tuesday, early Tuesday, on charges of being under the influence of controlled substance.  Yeah.  So he spent the night in jail, got out, went into a rehab, 
[02:09:30]  and now I guess he's going to have to answer those charges.  Holy cow.  What is this guy doing?  He's high, and he's always getting busted.  Yeah.  He's getting high and banging Ali McBeal.  Yeah.  But the thing is, he's got a great gig on that show.  I don't know who watches it, but obviously people do.  Rick.  I don't know.  I can't even sit through the goddamn promo.  I'm trying to watch The X-Files or something, and the next Ali McBeal.  Get in a coffin.  Goddamn scarecrow.  Hey, Lucy Liu is hot, dude. 
[02:10:00]  Lucy Liu, the black chick with the lips.  That really sums it up.  What?  I hate those mouthless black girls where all you see teeth and gum.  You know, the black girl with the big lips, aren't that now?  Oh, my God.  14 billion.  The black chick with the lips, though.  Hey, did you see the New York Jew who was a doctor?  No.  He was talking to that Puerto Rican car thief. 
[02:10:30]  What was his name?  Oh, he was right next to the alcoholic Irishman.  That's how he is.  Trying to make a deal with the Italian monster.  And the Asian guy with AIDS.  No, but that's true.  It's funny because it's true.  Wow, that's good.  Damn.  Was that you?  Yeah.  That was real good.  Yeah, I can't.  You watch that, Rick?  Yeah.  I can't even sit through the promos.  That is...  If a guy watches that, Ali McBeal. 
[02:11:00]  Daryl Strawberry is going to be on next year.  They love going on a ton of show.  OGB is making guest appearances next season.  Tune in.  They've got Robert Downey Sr. coming on.  Ali McBeal pretty soon.  All right.  We have Devin's brother, Luke, on.  Yeah.  Hey, Luke.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Luke, hey.  What's up, Luke?  Devin, I've never been prouder of you.  Oh, thank you.  That means a lot. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you.  He's in the big time.  Weren't you proud of him when he was on Home Alone 1 and 2?  No, he was a little brat then.  What about when he was in the stall at Macaulay?  Weren't you proud of him then?  Oh, that was one of our finest moments together, actually.  I was ashamed to dig up a picture.  Wait, say that again?  Luke and I went to Macaulay Culkin's surprise 18th birthday party.  Yeah?  That's right.  Were you in a shopping bag?  I couldn't fit by then.  I made a mistake.  I brought a clear bag.  What the hell is that kid doing in the bag? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, Kieran was about that age then, though.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Hey, where does Macaulay live?  Is he in New York?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did he listen to the show?  You know, it's very possible he could.  Wow, that's cool.  I'd like to meet him.  Yeah, he doesn't do things like this.  He's opposed to having fun.  He's always looking depressed, smoking his cigarettes.  We see him outside on 57 sometimes.  And he's got his head down, the hair's in front of his eyes, and he doesn't look like he wants  to have fun.  He's trying to hide the c*** stains in his face.  Now, wait. 
[02:12:30]  Now, wait a minute.  Now, wait a minute.  I meant, like, the arrival stains.  Yes.  The arrival stains.  Right, right.  When you get stained from arriving somewhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Luke, aren't you...  I'm still there on hold right now.  Luke, you turned me on to this show.  You were the one who told me to listen to this show.  There you go.  I turn it on, and I hear O.J. talking about...  Yeah, it's our first bed together.  It's a little O.A. moment we had together.  And now he's on the show.  What do you know?  I'm correct.  I've come pretty far, Luke.  I'd kick an ass, I might.  You've arrived pretty far, Devin? 
[02:13:00]  Arrive pretty far?  Yes.  See?  See where I get my chops?  All right, Luke.  We're going to have to let you go.  Yeah, man.  Take care of him, though.  Yeah, definitely.  Can he come down if he's finished with one?  Without a doubt.  Luke, where are you?  I'm in the city.  Just come on down now, anytime, all right?  Thanks, guys.  All right, Luke.  Love you guys.  I love you, Luke.  Later, Dev.  Love you, too.  All right.  You know what's really funny?  Their biggest bond as brothers is from two serial rapists with a radio show.  No, it was just another bonding in a long series of bondage between my brother and I. 
[02:13:30]  A.J.?  Yeah?  What's up?  I was once Mr. Met.  Mr. Met?  The Mr. Met.  The Kid with Down Syndrome.  You were Mr. Met.  I've never heard your show before in my life.  Yeah, wow.  Yes, indeed.  I was Mr. Met from 1994 to 1997.  Who was Mr. Met?  Mr. Met, the guy with the big baseball head.  Yes, the big effing baseball head. 
[02:14:00]  He's the mascot for the New York Mets.  And the Met hat was too small for his head.  Is that what that...  I thought that was testicular cancer with a hat.  And what pee booth do you clean now?  I'm a Yankee fan.  Um, all right, A.J., that's cool, I guess.  A.J.?  Yeah.  All right, you didn't qualify to...  It's not really a celebrity.  You sound kind of depressed about it.  I mean, is it difficult talking about it?  Is your head really that big?  Yeah, I still have flashbacks to Bat Day in the upper deck. 
[02:14:30]  Oh.  Are you now playing the colon of the Philly fanatic?  What'd you have to do?  Just kind of run around and wave or something?  Run around and wave and do stupid little gay dances.  Did you touch any little boys?  No.  Who doesn't?  I mean, come on, let's not ask the audience.  A.J., we've got to go because we've got a celebrity colony.  Oh, you sounded so sad.  Oh, A.J.?  Let's go, Rich. Rich, what's going on?  Hey, what's up? 
[02:15:00]  Hey, man.  I don't know.  I'm afraid to say now.  I'm afraid to say what I want.  No, go ahead.  Who are you?  Okay, I was the, about three, four weeks ago, I was the cop in The Sopranos.  Yeah.  In the back room with Ralphie.  No way.  Get out of here.  No way.  That's me, baby.  Seriously?  In the BJ scene?  Yeah, yeah, that's me, man.  That was my sickest BJ scene ever.  So Ralphie is plowing the girl and you were getting a hummer.  That's me, man.  Oh, my.  No way.  That was me, bro.  And you're like, watch the braces, honey.  That's my line right there. 
[02:15:30]  Do your line.  Do your line, man.  All right.  I'm going to need quiet.  Do you have a drum roll or something?  No, just do the line.  Yeah, we'll be quiet.  Just say it, bitch.  Yeah.  Watch the braces, honey.  She was a ho-a.  Yeah, that was so evil, though, because Ralphie was like, are you crying?  I'll give you something to cry about.  That was a sick thing.  Because you know it was hurting, because you knew where he was going with it.  And then when Tony gets a BJ interruptus, and he's getting one.  And by the way, I'm glad we brought this up. 
[02:16:00]  Last week's episode, how many times do we have to see Tony getting off?  Oh, didn't see it.  Oh, my God.  It was the most sex Tony's had in one episode.  And every two seconds, yeah, take it.  And he's got the face on, and he's just...  You've got the little lisp when you do the Gandolfini.  You've got to have that.  Son of a bitch.  Yeah, he does have that kind of little...  Son of a...  Have you heard Gay Junior yet?  No.  Gay Junior.  Tony, I swear to God, I'm not a faggot.  Dr. Kennedy's attractive.  I like him. 
[02:16:30]  I've got the ass cancer, stomach cancer, whatever it is.  And now I'm a fag.  Tony, I've got to talk to Dr. Kennedy.  Dr. Kennedy.  Dr. Kennedy.  There's a rumor he was all happy that he could have talked to Dr. Kennedy.  He was.  Don't touch the thermostat.  There's a rumor he's gay.  It made the rag magazine.  No.  Yeah, the actor.  No way.  I forgot his name, the actor that played...  No, he was in Godfather 2.  I know.  Greatest movie ever.  I know.  Donnyola showed me.  Hey, he showed me.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:17:00]  Donnyola, we come here.  Oh, what?  Is the cops going on?  Yeah, I'm still there.  What's your name?  Rich.  Rich?  Now, come on.  No effing around.  That was really you?  That was me, bro.  That was me.  I believe him.  Really?  Yeah, because he emailed us and stuff.  How was it being on The Sopranos?  It was a little contest.  What's that?  How was it being on The Sopranos?  Oh, it was great.  It was great.  Because one line on The Sopranos is better than, like, two Christmas holiday comedies.  In my humble opinion.  Yeah, like, even if you got on The Sopranos for one line... 
[02:17:30]  That is great.  We had The Rapist on.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We got on The Rapist.  Jose, uh...  Yeah, Employee of the Month.  Yeah.  We had the Russian mobster.  The Russian mob guy.  The Tony's sister with the fake leg.  Oh, nice.  We get them all.  Hey, come on.  I'm small potatoes.  We get them all.  I heard you on the phone with the chef.  Yeah.  Right.  I forgot about it.  Yeah.  We had him on there.  Why do I know your show better than you?  I know.  We're trying to think.  We had Meadow on.  Meadow was cool a while ago.  She was cool.  But now, I think it would be hard to get her. 
[02:18:00]  It was first season.  Or second season.  Now she's getting in the second.  She's actually too old for me.  She's in college, is it?  Yeah.  She's looking so good.  So good.  She's kind of looking good.  When she was laying on the bed, and Richie is taking a peek at her shirt, like, and he  pulled her shirt up and took a peek.  Oh, come on.  How about the previous episode where she's doing it with the half-Jewish, half-black guy?  Oh, yeah.  And she's got, like, her arms wrapped around.  She's got her arms.  You're right.  It's on.  Pulling on.  Also, we talked to Big Pussy's dog, Devin. 
[02:18:30]  Dog?  Yeah, we got the audio.  Big Pussy's dog.  We get them all.  Big Pussy's wife.  I am so concerned, Dragon.  Big Pussy's sea wife.  What are you doing to that dog?  What are you doing to him?  The dog is in a bag in the other corner.  Pull it down.  Pull it down.  You're going to make him pop.  I'll tell you, when you rub Alpo on certain spots, that lick in there, you're sure you're 
[02:19:00]  on.  But you've got to take off that darn bell.  It tingles.  Oh.  Oh.  Add new meaning to kibbles and bits.  Rich.  Yeah, yes, sir.  That's pretty cool.  Have you been in anything else?  What else?  How'd you get the gig?  I'm friends with the big guy there, Jim Gandolfini.  Oh, really?  Oh, so you're friends and he gets you on the show.  Yeah, that's right.  You can't call him Jim.  Everybody calls him James.  Oh, he's Jim.  Jim Cool, like De Niro.  I call him Bob.  Bobby De Niro. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, Bobby's big.  You must be his friend because he gave you a great scene.  Yeah, good scene, right?  Did you have your junk out?  Well, I kept pulling it out.  They would yell at me, put it back, put it back.  Now, I've always kind of wondered about that because I've never really had any, well, you  know, I'm a method actor.  I'm a method actor, I've got to tell you.  Now, in Dennis the Minutes, I had a make-out scene with Natasha Lyonne.  And I got to make out with her and that was kind of cool.  She was freaked out.  She'd never kissed a boy before.  So, you know, we were just...  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  Beautiful.  13.  Oh, you should have just told her to tell her. 
[02:20:00]  And how old were you?  I was 16 by that.  And she was 13?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  So, but, you know, I've always kind of wanted to know, like, during scenes like that, I mean,  she's on, I mean, in your case, she's on all fours.  She's, you know, how do I say this?  Supposed to be giving you a hummer.  Yeah.  And she's also, you know, getting a lot of attention to the...  Ploud.  Ploud.  Ploud on the...  Yeah.  We call it 40.  We call it being on the rotisserie.  You know, that's why my...  That's why my...  They worked it in and my hand was on the head because she was on all fours and she kept 
[02:20:30]  complaining she couldn't keep the rhythm.  It's true.  Yeah, because your hand is on the back of her head and you're just pulling on it.  I'm keeping the rhythm.  She kept on complaining she couldn't keep the rhythm.  See, I'm picturing this because I know how long these scenes take.  They take hours.  Yeah, just because they won't seem like that.  So, there's hours of this hot girl on her hands and knees...  Making them believe she's...  Crying because she's getting off the keister.  Oh, let me tell you.  Number one, she was a hoo-er. 
[02:21:00]  She was a nice hoo-er.  I liked her.  She seemed like a lovely girl.  Was she studying...  Well, I need an effing drink.  Hold on.  Let me touch the hand in the champagne.  Vinny from the...  Vinny the Racist is saying that Rich is a phony.  What?  Vinny.  Hey, yeah.  Is Rich still on the phone?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Rich.  Let me ask you.  Who's the casting director for The Sopranos?  Uh, Georgia and Walken.  Okay?  Now, shut up.  Who's the record?  Now, shut up.  Now, shut up. 
[02:21:30]  No, but he could have read the credits.  Yeah, what?  Oh, come on.  That's Christopher Walken's wife.  Yes, it is.  Yeah, yeah.  This is book.  A friend of my mom's.  Really?  Yeah.  You ever meet Christopher?  No, no.  The, uh, the, the, the, the Walken, Miss Walken.  I don't know her.  Christopher Walken's wife is a friend of your mom.  She calls up my mom and asks her to help cast, uh, cast films.  My mom's an acting teacher.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  There's nothing funny in that, so make up your own jokes.  Do you ever meet Chris or anything?  I have never met the, Chris, I've never, uh, the closest I've come is listening to Jay Moore.  Jay Moore's impression.  Oh, let me tell you, Miss Walken is not happy about that, my friend. 
[02:22:00]  Jay was on the line, uh, as, uh, Walken.  What do you mean, not happy?  Uh, she don't like it.  She don't, wait, wait.  Let me tell you, I swear on my life, I, when I was, I was in the room speaking to her and I said,  you know, there's a guy who does, uh, Christopher Walken perfect.  I mean, it makes me laugh every time.  And she gave me a look, man.  She was not happy about it.  Uh-oh.  Maybe she's seen the rest of his act.  Oh, my God.  Now, I saw Jay on Thursday and Friday of last week, and it was hysterical. 
[02:22:30]  I worked with him Saturday night.  He was great.  I did a Saturday night.  Yeah, look at you.  I love Jay.  See, they do that.  They do that, and I think it's personal.  Comedians do that.  No, but I do.  Yeah, we just mess around.  You're allowed to trash each other as long as you say.  As long as you go, no, I love the guy.  I love the guy, you know.  Then you're off the hook.  Then you're off the hook.  The guy's a kid toucher.  Great.  Yeah, he's responsible.  Well, then he's really great.  Hey, uh, Rich, that's pretty cool.  Hey, thanks, Bill.  I want to come by and say hello to you guys.  Macaulay Culkin is a dope-eyed midget dwarf faggot. 
[02:23:00]  But I love the guy.  But I love the guy.  That's how you do it.  Whoa.  Rich, come on by anytime.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  All right, people don't believe it when we say that.  But, I mean, that's Norton and the rest of them.  Oh, let me tell you.  I'm taking you up on it, bud.  All right, call again.  All right, brother.  All right, brother.  Take care.  Bye.  All right, let's take a break.  All right.  No ladies today.  Very disappointed.  We have an hour left.  It's all time.  Norton's got d***.  I got dumped. 
[02:23:30]  You have to say bosoms.  Or boobs.  But just the fact that somewhere tonight, someone's going to read, Norton has teeth.  That's a dumb sheet.  Right on.  Norton has bosoms.  I just want to hate.  I want to bosom eff them.  That's funny.  There's radio.  There's edgy.  There's psychotic.  And then there's ONA.  1027 WNEW.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Vinny.  Serving New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island. 
[02:24:00]  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  The worst of Opie and Excellency.  That doesn't sound so bad.  Sucks, man.  From wall to wall.  1027 WNEW.  This is for Brewer.  Yeah.  Brewer hanging out with us.  He's as loose as mine.  Here he goes. 
[02:24:30]  Played a little air guitar for us in the studio.  Best Angus Young.  This would be very, very funny if it was TV, Jim.  Very funny if it was TV.  Turning it up and he's wailing away.  I'm just hoping he's going to scream along to us.  I will sing the whole thing.  All right, here we go.  He's been singing the whole thing.  Hey, this will kill four minutes without.  Jim Bruin, I'm singing this ACD thing.  Whenever it comes in. 
[02:25:00]  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Here he goes.  Here he is.  Thank you. 
[02:25:30]  He's not going to be able to talk. 
[02:26:00]  That's a good part.  We're going to talk to you.  We're going to talk to you.  We're going to talk to you.  We're going to talk to you.  We're going to talk to you.  We're going to talk to you. 
[02:26:30]  He doesn't know the part.  He doesn't know the part.  We're going to talk to you.  That's what's cool about the guy because if you don't know what he's singing,  he's going to talk to you, because no one knows what he's singing anyway.  Did one time, I was like 18, I stayed over the night before to get tickets for ACDC. 
[02:27:00]  Wow, look at you, a huge fan.  NASCAR Coliseum, I was in my hiatus.  I would say I was peaking in Knuckleheadville.  Dude, ACDC was coming to college here and we were sleeping over for tickets or what?  Don't fag out on me, we're doing it, we're doing it, let's fag out on you, man.  And then you're like third on line, and you're right. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, you're right.  I've done it myself, you wait all night, you expect front row tickets, where were you?  I think it was like 17, everyone was like going, hey man, you wearing masculine?  You know what I mean, masculine?  They're like, oh God, no, that's horrible.  Dude, where are the seats?  Yo man, 319.  No, 319 sucks, man.  I was like, I was third on line, I got 319.  You know what happens is the box office opens, let's say 10, about 945, about 20 black guys 
[02:28:00]  come up.  And you go, wait a minute, black guys aren't in the ACDC?  What's going on?  They're all like, yeah man, we've been here since Friday.  Yo, back off white boy.  Yeah, ACDC, yo.  Piled the tickets.  I was about to rock.  We have something left in the limited sight seating for you, Brewer.  I have to sign the stage here, young man.  Since I've been here, okay, I'm still tripping on masculine. 
[02:28:30]  Okay, in the middle of the night, my friend made me walk to the Aussie Pole, and I never  even knew, I felt the story because I was tripping, okay?  And I go walking out, and in the middle, my friend goes, yo, don't step in the darkness.  Now, for an hour and a half, I didn't know what he was talking about.  He said, see the grease stains?  That's the darkness.  And I started looking, and I thought it was the darkness, bitch. 
[02:29:00]  Now, I spent three hours looking for an Aussie Pole, running away from the darkness.  Don't tell me I'm sitting behind the effing mother effing effing behind the black dudes.  Behind the stage.  Do you understand me, whore?  I was urine in a Nazi thigh on your forehead.  You brought the demon out of me, woman.  Wow, where'd I go?  You were somewhere, man, in the darkness.  I'm back.  It's already me. 
[02:29:30]  Let's keep crying.  Ah, I'm back, yeah.  Let's get so busy.  Tim Brewer and ACDC. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, man, I've got to head back.  Coming to a stadium near you.  Do you have the limited view seats?  The seats are in the parking lot outside the arena.  Very limited view.  You hear a muffled sound of a sound check.  We've got a guy that used to work with you.  That's what he has to say.  Bill.  Jim.  Bill.  What's going on?  Who is this?  I used to hang out with you.  One of the first places that you used to play was Febbs. 
[02:30:30]  Febbs in Elmont.  Remember Rob's Band, Accelerate.  Rob, um...  Cis.  Cis?  Yeah.  Cisleano.  Steve.  Wow.  That's like you were just starting out.  Dude, I was like 17 in high school.  You know when you go to, like, the local...  Tonight!  That's a rocker!  And he'd come in like, oh, my friend Jerry's sedacist.  Do I need to pay the $3 cover? 
[02:31:00]  You and the girlfriend.  And only one guy was able to get alcohol.  He was drinking a parking lot for the diner across the street in February.  Yeah, Febbs in Elmont.  And I was doing stand-up.  I was the only guy doing stand-up before a band.  At a rock club.  At a rock club.  I remember my friend.  Do you remember the bit I used to do?  Live Aid came out.  Guys, you were doing an Okanazi bit.  Yes!  That's what I'm talking about.  It was a Live Aid just came out, and I said, um...  This was my big joke.  I'm like 17. 
[02:31:30]  I'm like, have you guys seen Live Aid?  You're three people.  Woo!  Do-ah!  Do-ah!  You're three people.  Go ahead, Jimmy!  Yay!  Mommy's there, right there.  The one drunk.  No, that was like the one guy...  No, I had this one chick that used to be dating.  I didn't even know she was banging the lead singer.  I had no clue.  I'm opening for the band.  Meanwhile, you're three weeks later.  No, no, no.  Different band.  Remember the Warshallocs?  Yeah, it's a Long Island band. 
[02:32:00]  Anyway, so my bit was, uh, I thought I was a genius.  I went out and was like, yeah, did you guys see Live Aid from Ethiopia?  The funniest part is when they threw an Ethiopian up there and Ozzy bit his head off.  Good night, here comes Rockalola!  Rockalola.  Who knows about to lie?  You know, my two friends, all right, bro!  You're going to be so one.  Remember when I walked like a pigeon? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Bill.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  All right, syndication out.  Hey, Bill, how's it going?  You too.  I played Feb's.  I think everybody did at one point.  Yeah.  Played there, man, years ago with an assortment of bands at Feb's.  And you'd leave.  Like you said, there'd be five people in the place, all your buds.  You'd leave, and the guy would tell you, you know, you owed money for the beer and stuff.  Yeah, but you know, this is called paying the dues, guys.  You've got to stick it out.  You've got to stay together and do this.  You know, load in, load out. 
[02:33:00]  What time are we on?  All right, we're on at 11 o'clock, one in the morning.  All right, man.  Any minute now, we're on stage.  They've got bands up there just finishing up their last song.  They're doing the live version of Free Bird.  It could be any minute now.  We'll be on frigging stage.  And then you get bands, especially Long Island bands, were notorious for this.  No matter how small the club was, they wanted like a pyrotechnic show that the Coliseum couldn't hold.  And there was a band called Rough Cut that was playing around the island.  I can't remember them.  They set off these charges and like maimed six people in the front row. 
[02:33:30]  And they'd shoot them and everything.  It was amazing.  But they used to blow these things up where you would feel a concussion.  You'd leave there like you just came back from the knob.  You'd have like shell shock.  I was at the Rough Cut show.  I don't even know where I am anymore.  The horror.  The horror.  Do you remember Night Ranger?  No, not Night Ranger.  It was like night.  How many local Long Island bands are at night in there?  We're Night's Fire.  Night something. 
[02:34:00]  We'll take Night and then just pick another name.  Motley Crue, did you hear Home Sweet Home?  Dude, it's the same dude that talked to a producer.  We wrote that song and we're in total arrangement to sue them.  Because that was our song.  You know, Poison's Every Rose.  Dude, don't you remember last year we had the rose song?  They stole it.  We're going to L.A. and we're going to start some crap.  It ain't funny, Dick.  I really wrote it.  Me and Tommy wrote it.  We were high out of our bearings.  And you know, my brother, you know, he works at the record store. 
[02:34:30]  A guy came in the other day that talked to a guy that worked as a cleaning crew for the record company.  You're lying.  So now we have an in.  So we're getting our tape together.  Dude, I don't believe you.  I'm glad to God.  Two years.  I'm glad to God, man.  This time it's going to happen.  This time it's going to happen.  Let me see it.  Let me see it.  You know, people like you that...  You know, I'm sure Nirvana at some point had the same deal.  Oh, I'm going to get my transmits. 
[02:35:00]  I'm going to jam through the streets, Dick.  Let me see it, Dick.  Until you stay the last three weeks, Dick.  And when am I going to jam with you?  It's like a spinal tap.  It was just that constantly went on.  You hump equipment in the winter.  Yep.  You play for 20 minutes.  You run no one.  And then you go across the street to the diner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  And you shout out, like, eggs with ketchup.  Dude, how killer.  Dude, we rocked, man.  Oh, shit. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  Freaking, oh.  Dude, but the rigging...  You know something?  The mistake you made during Driven, you know, man?  Put down Tommy's mistake.  He misassembled.  That wasn't me.  No, I heard a bass...  That wasn't me.  I heard a bass eff up, man.  It was a bass eff up.  Tommy was just trying to help you out and compensate for you.  You're off time.  If you showed up at every rehearsal instead of banging that damn shit that you with now,  because she's screwing up.  Your head hasn't been into the band since you hooked up with that chick.  Dude, you wouldn't even be in a band.  How many times you... 
[02:36:00]  All right, name a song you wrote.  Name a song you wrote.  Okay, okay.  What about Desire?  What about Driven?  I wrote at least the vocals on Driven.  What about...  What about Touch?  What about Stand?  I wrote them all.  Where were you?  Whatever, dick.  She's driving your life, man.  And, you know, we'll go on to stardom, and you're just going to be working in the Sears  Paint Department.  So you just stay there.  Okay?  It's having a...  We're flying.  You're dying.  It's too real for you.  As you take the hand truck, load it into the equipment through the snow, walk away two 
[02:36:30]  minutes, and your amp is gone.  Because the great local band's spirit of togetherness, if you left something without a pair of eyes  on it for two seconds, the other local band would steal it.  Mother...  I swear to God.  Dude, I can't tell you.  Who stole the freaking hand truck?  I can't tell you.  Every time I pull up late, you see, like, one of my friend's bags, and you see...  And everyone had their hair down in here.  Yeah, yeah.  And you see the one kid's smoking cigarettes.  Not good, man. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, man.  Not good, dude.  It's not.  This took his freaking Marshall head, man.  I can't work overtime in stock.  I'm already working in Sears and Stern.  I can't afford a Marshall.  You know what that is?  God, man.  This is bloody, man.  It was that bag from White Fire.  White Bag.  It's his name.  Flashback for Anthony. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, believe me.  I was there, man.  We've got to take a break.  We are so late.  We are so late.  Jim Brewer making us all laugh today.  Our phone number, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.

Okay, anybody here know what a street smart tune-up costs at your Toyota dealer?  $59.  I'm not finished.  I'm talking about a street smart tune-up using genuine Toyota spark plugs.  $59.  Hold on, I'm still not finished.  It also includes installation of genuine Toyota air filters. 
[02:41:30]  Same $59.  Wait, there's more.  What if we also included checking the belts and hoses?  $59.  Perform system diagnostic checks?  $59.  Plus all the labor?  $59.  Hey, you're right.  For $59, your Toyota dealer offers you a street smart tune-up using genuine Toyota parts installed by Toyota train technicians.  That's a whole lot better than paying $75 to $100 at an off-brand place.  I know.  How did you know?  I just had my Camry tune.  My kid sister, her RAV4.  My father-in-law, his Parola.  Prices for six-cylinder, eight-cylinder, and platinum plugs are higher. 
[02:42:00]  Barely.  Come in for a street smart oil change.  It's only $19.95 plus tax.  Prices may vary.  It's a lot of money.  Press lube dealers, Tundra, Previa, and Land Cruiser may be higher, but hey, it's still cheap.  Homeowners, how many times have you painted your house?  Need to paint again this spring?

[02:47:00]  New York.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  All right, we're hanging with Jim Brewer today.  Okay.  Yeah, okay, Scott.  We're ready to go here.  Joe, what's up?  What's happening, guys?  All right, we're hanging with Brewer.  He's making us laugh.  Yeah, he's awesome.  He's awesome.  I'm a huge fan.  I actually started listening to you guys in November of 99, and I'm just totally hooked. 
[02:47:30]  You guys are absolutely awesome.  All right.  Did you like Jim?  All right.  Yeah.  Jim, you totally rocked, too, man.  There's a story I heard you tell that is absolutely awesome.  I was hoping you could share with us again.  I think you used to work against Sears or something.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The bomb threat?  The bomb threat?  You got it, man.  Oh, yeah.  Talk to me.  No, talk to me.  What happened was I was 17, 18.  First of all, you're 17, 18.  I'm working at Sears in Valley Street.  Oh, boy.  And I worked with this hardcore stoner.  And we would take, like, 40, we'd do tag team 45-minute breaks. 
[02:48:00]  I'd come in, like, my turn.  I'd leave in 45 minutes, talk to, like, some ice cream shakes.  Well, your boobies grew a lot this summer.  I'm sure.  So, anyway, you know, I'd call up.  There was this fat dude in a toy, Scott, Scott something.  Every day I'd watch his balls.  I'd call up.  Hi, I read in the paper there, Sal.  Can you go in the back and check if the spalding balls are there? 
[02:48:30]  And I'd watch this fat dude go in the back.  And I don't want any damn rain checks.  Do you understand me?  Because I've been in there three times.  And if I come in with a rain check, I'm stomping a mud hole in your pooper.  All right, fat so?  And they'd be like, Drew, this is you.  Actually, you call me fat.  Let's go to you.  How do you know I'm fat?  So, anyway, so we'd have fun, right?  So, one day, this guy's very serious. 
[02:49:00]  Had to have been about almost 40 years old.  And he comes walking.  And he's the only one.  You know, when you're wearing serious, they tell you, you must wear appropriate clothes.  And so, you know, we'd wear, like, black jeans.  And a Chet King shirt, three for $99.  Remember, you had the one purple suit?  You are from Long Island, man.  $99.  You know, like Chet King with the black and look leather tie.  $99, Spaggy. 
[02:49:30]  Those suits and appliances take the real stuff.  $99.  I got three of them.  Anyway, this guy bought one of his real suits from, like, Stearns or whatever.  Loser places.  Oh, do we?  That doesn't matter.  Like we carry that.  Wallach.  And he walks in the hardware.  And we had a big rivalry because I was in the paint department.  And paint was next to hardware.  And we never crawled.  It was like Rosedale Valley Stream. 
[02:50:00]  You guys stay on that side.  We'll stay here.  It'll be no trouble.  Hardware fairy.  And we played it seriously.  So anyway, this dude comes walking.  I'm looking at him, looking at him.  It's me and a stoner guy.  And I go, and he comes back from hardware.  And he goes, you know, that guy in hardware is really serious.  He just yelled at me for hanging there.  I went, really?  He went and yelled at me.  He said, yeah, he's very serious.  He's a dick.  So I go, all right.  So I call up.  And at the time, it was, I think it was 1985 or 84. 
[02:50:30]  Do you remember when we had the big thing going on with Libya?  Oh, yeah.  And we shot six missiles.  I bombed him.  After that, I hit his tent and killed his daughter.  And on the way, we bombed the goddamn French for not letting us use their airspace.  Did you hear me?  Now, instead of launching missiles, I have to wake up next to a big-headed Nancy Mardi Gras float-head-looking Pez dispenser. 
[02:51:00]  Goddamn.  Finger on the button one day, and a little rascal crapping my diapers.  What happened?  Are you guys a Kinnison fan?  Oh, yeah.  You're a Kinnison fan.  He bombed the liver.  He goes, so we bombed Lydia.  And he goes, but we made one mistake.  We accidentally bombed the French embassy.  And he goes, oh, well, I guess it must have been all those. 
[02:51:30]  Where do you keep the little girl?  Oh, dear.  Say it.  Qaddafi, 84.  Yeah.  What started that whole thing was he shot, Qaddafi shot six Libyan missiles at a U.S. plane. 
[02:52:00]  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  Anyway, where do you remember?  That's the history of the story.  Here's a history backup story.  Those are you SNL people.  Everything in SNL is like, what's the back story?  Who cares?  It's three minutes.  All right.  The gold was invented.  I don't know.  It's just a guy that walks into his head.  What is so good?  She's very, she's very.  Oh, yeah.  The guy who grew up in Mexico.  Yeah.  That sketch would have never worked without a backup story. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  You're right.  Sorry.  Let's get a backup story here.  So, I get on the phone, and I swear, I swear to God, I get on, and I go, hello, this is  Muammar Qaddafi.  Okay?  He's calling personally.  I'm calling you guys.  Muammar Qaddafi.  I am Muammar Qaddafi.  You know, the stone is behind me.  He goes, he told me he's listening.  He told me he's listening.  This is Muammar Qaddafi, and I have just sent six Libyan missiles to hit your hardware department. 
[02:53:00]  And Sears Valley streams, you ugly, rude, gloving bosset.  I hate the twos, the twos are supposed to faggot.  I am Muammar Qaddafi.  The missiles will hit your department.  You must run, you hardware faggot.  Pants department rules.  Sears Valley streams.  Oh, I'm rude.  Oh, I'm rude.  Now, I swear to God, me and my friend walk, I swear to God.  I'm ready for those guys. 
[02:53:30]  The guy I was working with, I just worked in Miami, and this kid I went to school.  I used to get all the high school kids, oh, you've got to come to Sears, man.  You charge a freaking brush for $8, you walk out with a paint machine.  Don't tell anyone.  Yeah, Sears is what I always had to say, yo, it's my father's birthday.  Dude, can you hook me up, man?  You know, can you bring a little paintbrush up, you know, put a little stick on?  You know what I'm saying?  All right, go ahead, help us touch my way here.  So now, we're laughing our asses off. 
[02:54:00]  Me and this kid, Scott, we walk out of the room.  We go into the Sears break room.  I'm cracking up.  I'm like, ah, what a dick that guy is.  Oh, Qaddafi.  He's sitting, and I could see him writing everything down.  He's like, he asked me three times, who is this?  I said, it's Muammar Qaddafi.  Can you say it again?  This guy's retarded.  Muammar Qaddafi.  So we leave.  A sweater comes walking back in, and there's like, nobody around. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  So I'm looking around, and all of a sudden, you know the fake security guys?  Reticops.  Yeah, the reticops.  They're mall security guys.  They always have the little paper bags.  What the hell is that?  They're like the one of the undercover guys.  So he comes walking out from the back, and he goes, Brewer, and this guy hated me.  He hated me.  He was so into it, I'd always go, nice head.  What's in the bag? 
[02:55:00]  All my cover.  Yeah, you give me that little, oh, take your down, Brewer.  So the guy comes out.  I'm being in security, God damn it.  I'm undercover.  Undercover is the other thing.  You're right, Anthony.  It's a very different.  Here's undercover.  I'm undercover.  We've got a 321 near the screwdrivers, a 321.  Please, I need backup.  Where the hell is the practical place?  They said, and next thing you know, I'm here in fear, that I don't know where the hell  I'm at here. 
[02:55:30]  Oh.  So I come out.  There's nobody there.  I'm looking around.  And all of a sudden, this undercover guy comes out, and he goes, Brewer, what are you doing?  You've got to get out of the building.  We've got to get out of the building.  We've got to get out of the building.  And like a dick, I thought he was screwing with me.  And I went, what are you talking about?  There's no bomb threat.  And so the guy from Hardware, Jerry, the new guy in Hardware, some guy he couldn't understand,  called.  And I went, oh my God. 
[02:56:00]  I go, no.  What is he, a dick?  That was me.  You got to it right there.  You only got to it.  And his face went from, I hope you're lying to me, because, you know, the fire department  and the police are on the way.  This is like serious stuff.  Okay, here's what happened, all right? 
[02:56:30]  This is you guys, okay?  Tuck me down from that thing.  Brewer, please, come out.  It's okay, we got your mom here.  We're going to talk you out of here.  No, because I know.  You're going to rip me, man.  We understand.  No one's going to hurt you.  We understand it was a joke.  You're going to shake a pink hand in my ass.  It's not funny, I know.  All right, everybody.  Drop the pink hands, guys.  Drop the pink hands.  We're going to go with plan B.  Listen, listen.  Here's what happened. 
[02:57:00]  Here's what happened, okay?  First of all...  Tell us the location of Muammar Gaddafi.  You're a counterpart.  There's no Muammar Gaddafi, dick.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, here comes Muammar Gaddafi.  He's coming to Valley Stream.  And he's coming to Sears Valley Stream.  And he wants to bomb hardware.  Are you guys all dicks or not?  You heard it.  That's the conclusion, guys.  Hey.  Nice.  Hey.  So what the hell happened, man?  So what happened?  I got down there. 
[02:57:30]  Thank God the cops didn't come yet.  And I have one of them PBA guys.  Yeah, those were.  Here's what happened.  For bomb threats.  Hey, look.  I'm with you guys.  You know what I'm saying?  I called in a bomb threat, but here's my PBA guy.  What are you nuts?  I shot a guy down the road.  But look, I got the plan.  It might work if you run a red light, but I don't know about this.  Listen, guys, we're cool.  Back off.  I hear OJ handed them on a hook.  Hey, it's okay. 
[02:58:00]  I got a PBA card from the last time the police were here when I was beating her.  Cards get all blood on it.  I'm with you, man.  I'm with you, baby.  I'm with you, baby.  Blood sucks.  PBA card.  Yeah, I know.  I got friends.  On the floor.  They're on the job.  Bloody PBA card.  Yo, Randy Lach, show me off.  Show me off.  So what happened was eventually, and true story, the guys, I had to meet with the district 
[02:58:30]  president of Sears.  And how it really went down was I went in there, and I met with this guy, and I come walking  in, and he's behind his table.  And I go, walking in there, and I go, listen.  Yeah.  I go, I'm very sorry.  First of all, I've straightened out all the paint cans.  I put all the little yellow for-sale signs up.  All the easy living paints were in order.  Easy living. 
[02:59:00]  Satin coat.  Satin, satin.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  I can't tell you how many houses I've ruined.  They're going to come in like, listen, I'm redoing my exterior.  No matter what, I always say.  Well, then you want to go with satin flat.  It doesn't matter, right? 
[02:59:30]  Well, obviously, you're going to need the satin flat.  And then you guys are kind of like, man, that crap came filling off.  Well, did you prime it?  What do I prime it with?  Well, the satin flat.  The satin flat.  You've got to do four coats.  I'll give you a new one.  You're on the other side.  Get out of here.  That's classic.  Like you cared, you know?  Oh, man.  I can't even tell you how much I didn't care.  You've got to take a break.  We are so late. 
[03:00:00]  We are so late.  It's Jim Brewer making us all laugh today.  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  Stay there.  Opie Anthony.  We have our penises.  We do all of our speaking.  We do all the talking for us.  107-WMW. </pre>
