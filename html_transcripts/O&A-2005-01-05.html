<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a segment featuring a profane rap performance, followed by a discussion with “Old Dirty,” a friend known for his criminal history, and “Master Poe,” a large security guard.  The conversation ranged from the election to scams, drugs, and Old Dirty's criminal exploits, punctuated by jokes about potential violence and Master Poe's imposing presence.  This was followed by a call with a pregnant listener, Diane, who engaged in a humorous and sexually explicit exchange with the hosts, including a game of “Guess What’s in My Pants,” involving guessing her pubic hair style based on sounds.  The discussion also touched on Diane’s sex life with her husband, Kevin Straley's TV appearance, Bill Maher, and a palimony lawsuit.  The segment concluded with XM Radio and sponsor advertisements.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of break-up lines, a nostalgic look at the 1970s, and an email about comedian Rich Voss’s girlfriend, Bonnie, calling him during his stand-up act. Voss called in, recounting the incident and a previous performance after Bob Levy’s extremely dirty act.  The discussion evolved into humorous anecdotes about Voss's relationship with Bonnie, portrayed as him being "whipped," including a phone call during the show where he refused to hang up.  The segment also included discussions about Jim Norton's stand-up performances, a video of Norton with a woman and poker chips, Norton's flatulence, a planned Thanksgiving segment, other listener calls and anecdotes (including Colin Quinn throwing a quarter at a swan and a complaint about Norton's behavior), and concluded with a new Doug Stanhope song, "Monster Rain."

A subsequent segment featured a caller, Jimmy, detailing graphic childhood sexual experiences with older women and a male friend, including mutual masturbation and oral sex with his friend's intellectually disabled brother.  The hosts and Jimmy debated whether these acts were "gay."  Guest Bob Kelly briefly joined the conversation.  The segment also included a phone interview with Bart King, author of "The Big Book of Boy Stuff," excerpts of which were read on air, interrupted by technical difficulties.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Jimmy's experiences, a brief call from Ozzy Osbourne discussing marital issues, and miscellaneous banter.

Ozzy Osbourne's call detailed his consideration of divorcing Sharon Osbourne due to her infidelity (including an affair with Randy Rhoads) and lack of intimacy.  The hosts made crude jokes about Ozzy's marital problems and Sharon's aging appearance.  This was followed by a chaotic in-studio appearance by comedian John Valby, who, lacking his keyboard, performed improvised, vulgar, and politically charged acapella songs.  The hosts attempted to locate his keyboard, eventually sending him to the Steinway building, where they were asked to leave due to his inappropriate singing.  The segment concluded with discussions and audio clips related to O.J. Simpson and hypothetical video games based on the O.J. Simpson trial and Chappaquiddick.

The final segment featured a darkly humorous game inventing outrageous scenarios centered on the Kennedy family's scandals, including death, rape, and drug use.  Specific Kennedys were named.  The conversation shifted to Robert Chambers and a caller's suggestion of a game involving sex in various New York City locations. Another caller, Rob, recounted a skiing trip with Opie, highlighting Opie's reckless behavior. The segment ended with XM radio advertisements and a "Wow sticker stop" event.

[00:03:00]  It's the O&A virus  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:03:30]  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:04:00]  The Opie and Anthony show 
[00:04:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you. 
[00:05:30]  Thank you. 
[00:06:00]  Thank you. 
[00:06:30]  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Damn.  Old Dirty's outside the studio, one of our old friends.  And one of our listeners, quickly, Pat from Jersey, saying, ring of fire, isn't that how  the kids' asses feel after Michael Jackson gets through with them?  Very funny, Pat.  Why is Jim taking a phone call during the radio show?  It's a chick.  Oh, because it's a girl. 
[00:07:30]  What happened?  Bye.  Is it a chick?  No, it's my friend Yoshi.  Oh, Yoshi.  Oh.  The smut puddler.  The smut puddler.  The smut puddler.  You ought to see him put down smut and then put a coat over it so a lady doesn't step in  it.  Ah!  I can blame the granola on that one.  I couldn't get the granola.  So, Old Dirty's outside.  Yeah.  Wasn't he arrested for puddling drugs? 
[00:08:00]  And he was talking to Master Paul.  Does Master Paul, what, taped off an area?  Well, Old Dirty's one of those guys that's kind of on the watch list when he comes in.  Yeah, he's a good friend of ours, but he's been known to steal.  Yeah.  What he does, whenever he walks into anywhere, he's instantly casing the joint.  He looks around, like, I'm sure he's looking at power tools and stuff from construction  going, yeah, I could sell that, yo.  Yeah.  I hate that.  But the funniest, though, was watching him on the security camera outside with Poe, and 
[00:08:30]  Poe's got him up against the wall, and he's searching him and everything.  And he has, Old Dirty has, you know, a two-foot area that he can only be in.  And Poe was watching him.  Yeah, he's restricting him to a two-foot area.  They have it taped off like Les Nesman's office.  There's little duct tape all around the floor.  You know what?  Old Dirty and two fans are just kind of sitting and watching us through the window.  And Poe is out there lecturing.  Why don't we bring Master Poe in real fast?  We have a lot to get to.  Then we might bring Old Dirty in for a little while, then get him back outside the studio  so he can get some radio done. 
[00:09:00]  And then we'll bring Old Dirty back in, all right?  Master Poe, what's the scene out there?  You're the best, oh, wow.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  You're the best, oh, wow.  Yes, that's the problem.  Nothing's going to ever keep you down.  My head is too big for this.  Okay.  I'm sorry, what is the scene?  You have two young men that came here from Brooklyn.  They're diehard fans.  They cannot wait to, well, they couldn't wait to come in.  So Ben was very nice, and he allowed them to come inside.  What a guy.  They look a little scary. 
[00:09:30]  No, they're scared, but they're good kids.  Oh, they are scared, okay.  You know, the young man in the middle, he's...  You'll find him right in there.  Which one do you like, Ope?  I like the kid without the hat.  Well, the one without the hat, he went to a game with, I think, a Yankees hat, it was,  and he got into a fight, so that should be interesting.  Is that why his head is misshaped?  Yeah.  Does he still get residuals from the deliverance scene in the mountains?  Wow, that's it.  You've got to see this mess.  Damn, I was trying to... 
[00:10:00]  Very good.  You got it.  You got it.  No, they're good kids.  That's the one.  Why the towel around your neck?  Just in case I need it.  Why are you looking at me like that?  I haven't done anything to you today.  Why are you even asking him that?  Because you wouldn't ask that unless you thought it was a little odd and strange.  Why are you calling Master Poe odd or strange?  I don't understand why he has to walk around with a towel around his head.  You're working out constantly, right?  During the breaks and stuff?  Yeah.  Yes.  That's all he does.  The video is up on opianthony.com.  So if he works up a little sweaty, he can dab it off a little bit. 
[00:10:30]  And what's the deal with Old Dirty today?  What's your opinion on him?  I think that, first of all, he seems as though that he's sincere.  He enjoys...  He wanted to be here.  He can't wait to come inside.  But, you know, he was a little rough around the edges, and I had to introduce myself.  All right.  Get to Old Dirty in here real fast.  Jim, just move over microphones.  I want these two right next to each other.  Old Dirty!  Yo, what up? 
[00:11:00]  What up, kid?  Cody!  Antonio!  What's happening, bro?  What's good, my nigga?  Hanging out.  Come on, man, Master Poe.  He's serious, dude.  Oh, yeah.  You gotta be careful with this kid.  You can tell, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You don't fuck around.  He is the real deal.  You know, Old Dirty lives on the street, pretty much.  Remember how much we used to have to...  He's street-wise.  We used to have to dump out of Old Dirty's conversations.  Remember how many times you would drop the F-bombs and stuff?  All the time, and they're like, oh, my bad.  It's like, God, we're working under the FCC rules. 
[00:11:30]  Not anymore.  No, it's funny.  Old Dirty didn't like the fact that Poe's first name is Master.  No, you know...  I called him Bastard, actually.  You know what?  I told him, yo, my man, what's your name?  And he goes, I didn't hear him properly.  I go, okay.  So I said, Bastard, can I have a drink of water, please?  Oh, boy.  He got heated, but my bad, Master Poe, I didn't, you know, a little waxy in the morning, you  know what I mean?  He could have snapped your neck like a twig.  And my man Luke Dangerous, got a good grip on him, too, Sean.  Quite frankly, we're all scared of him. 
[00:12:00]  I don't trust motherfuckers because they've got towels on their necks.  Right, exactly.  And he works.  He's part of the team, but we're scared of him.  We don't know when he's going to snap on it, and I...  Yeah, he looks like he commands...  I don't talk about it with the cargo pants either, dude.  What?  He looks like he's ready to assault me.  Like he's ready to fuck a nigga up.  Yeah.  Master Poe.  What?  Motherfucking what?  Dude, don't shadowbox in front of Master Poe.  Are you insane?  I'm not trying to... 
[00:12:30]  Master Poe, did you see that?  Look, he goes into his own.  He saw you out of his peripheral vision.  It looks like you're ready to attack.  Dude, he's trying to calm down.  This isn't...  Are you serious?  This isn't fake crap.  Will you relax?  This guy goes into his zone.  Out of the peripheral.  Now, because you just did that, he's trying to calm down instead of snap your neck, and  now he's going to have to go back into his cubicle and do that whole calming down ritual  that he does, right?  You all right, Master Poe?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I was just...  I'm okay.  I'm back.  See, there was like a little thing there where you're making the moves. 
[00:13:00]  All of a sudden, he goes right into defensive mode.  Dude, he's the real deal, man.  It's like a lion.  You can't parade a zebra in front of a lion and go, hey, well, the lion's got to know  the zebra's just kidding.  You know, it doesn't work.  Like on the plains of the Serengeti, Anthony.  That's exactly what I'm talking about.  You know, this is...  Yo, my bad, Master Poe.  Oh, gave him a little bow?  I like that.  Respect.  Yeah, because he's all done.  The orientated, the pressure points and shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He could take your arms out where you won't even...  Your arms will be at your side as he's pounding your head.  He could take them out instantly to where they're just useless pieces of meat hanging 
[00:13:30]  from your side.  So we're not going to have a problem with him, right, Master Poe?  Well, no.  When I first arrived, I asked him if he had any weapons.  And he said, well, no, but...  And I said, no, no.  I need to know if you have any weapons.  What did he take off you?  I need to know if you have any weapons.  If you have a weapon, we have a problem.  I'm asking you right now.  Take your weapons and place it on the table.  Right.  If you do that...  Your ass bust out my Glock.  Yeah.  And when I went to Annie, though, I'm sorry, Master.  That's quite all right.  Go ahead. 
[00:14:00]  Talk.  When I went to Annie W, I always had something.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I know.  We know.  Trust me, we know.  You had to defend yourself against the likes of Ken Stevens and his poncho.  Well, I had asked him if he had any weapons, and he said no.  And I told him, I said, look, if I find a weapon on you, we have a problem.  We're no longer friends.  We're no longer compadres.  We're no longer familia.  There's been a...  You know, he would have been trying to deceive you, and that's no way to start a friendship. 
[00:14:30]  Exactly.  Yeah.  And once he enters our threshold, he's mine.  Everyone in here...  He's mine.  ...is owned by you.  They are mine.  You guys realize this will be called the Master Poe Show eventually, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's going to just completely take off.  I'm okay with that.  How about you?  Yeah, I'm ready to leave.  I'm just going to start with a little subtle hint.  Anthony, I don't like when you do that impression.  Yeah.  And I'll say, okay, Master Poe.  Yes, Sensei.  I have to tell you a funny story. 
[00:15:00]  Uh-oh.  On my school...  No, no, no.  All right, Master Poe.  It's not about Geraldo, is it?  Everyone laughs.  Oh, no.  No, my students, they know that I don't curse.  Yeah.  I don't, all right?  And what happens is one of my students called up another student of mine, and they said,  well, you know, how is Master Poe going to handle this?  Because Opie and Anthony, they curse all the time.  Is he going to jump in the studio and say, shut up?  And he says, no, you can't do that.  That would be a wrong thing to do.  Uh-huh.  And I told him, I says, you know, why should I do that? 
[00:15:30]  I mean, these guys are fabulous at what they're doing.  That's their act.  Thank you, Master Poe.  And they're not, you know, that's not who they are off the air.  They're actually great people.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Master Poe, if you got any, if you got like some mind skills, you need to.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, God.  I told you you'd laugh.  Keep laughing.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, everyone laughed in front of Master Poe, right? 
[00:16:00]  Yo, dude, I wasn't mean, you know her?  Huh?  I wasn't mean.  Are you laughing?  No, I was not laughing.  Oh, I was just checking.  All right.  All right.  I'm just making sure that you know that I wasn't laughing.  No.  Know that I have their back.  Yo, my man.  That's it.  This guy so has our back.  Okay.  I don't know why.  I don't know what kind of threats have come in to Washington.  This is his job.  To have them hire a guy like him.  He takes his job very seriously, and he will take care of any problems that might arise.  All right.  That's it.  Well, Old Dirty, we're going to get to you in a little while. 
[00:16:30]  It's about respect.  All right.  So go back to your little fenced-in area.  Master Poe can show him out, I guess.  Yeah.  No doubt.  Thank you, gentlemen.  There he goes.  Master Poe.  There he goes.  Escorting Lorenzo out.  You know what?  Old Dirty.  Master Poe would not leave the studio first.  He did not want his back to old Dirty.  No, no, no, no, no. 
[00:17:00]  He makes sure everything is secure.  The best was old Dirty started walking in the wrong direction.  He's like, no, no, no, over here.  He grabbed him.  And what did old Dirty do?  He just, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  It's funny to see old Dirty behave.  It's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  We all laughed, right?  Dude, you give him the hoo-hoo-hoo laugh.  No, we had a laugh.  Crazy.  When he says, I have something funny to say, you make sure there's a laugh at the end of that story.  He could have told that stupid Ben Giraldo story. 
[00:17:30]  I would have doubled over.  What do you mean?  He doesn't use a garage?  Come on.  Ben tells a story.  I want to throw that XM cup in his head, and I know I won't miss him, no matter what direction I fling it in.  And people ding it all the time.  Yeah.  They ding his car.

It's just that sometimes you want to  Yeah, you want to perform I can I can you just want you just want to just  You don't want to just sit there and flounder and please touch my neck  You know you just want to just really be a girl like me and Patrice was stand at the bar in Rio in this whorehouse 
[00:37:30]  And we're both wearing robes and flip-flops and I popped the Viagra and my mule  It's just a huge tent my robe and me and him are just looking at it realizing we're in Sodom and Gomorrah and we're just  We're just laughing at this scene straight out the chicks all know they go Viagra Viagra  They can look at me and understand but it's so hot a girl just rub your leg and you just get this  Pulsating and gorge direction. It's fantastic. That's wow. That's great  In a regular erection is fine, but you can't come again right after you can't get up right after that 
[00:38:00]  That's the beauty of Viagra, but it don't stay hard after like you do the Viagra. Nah, but you're ready to go shortly after  Hey, we also okay, you know we have another story. I look who's on TV  Yeah  Well, he really just is sitting next to him. Oh Kevin's trailer is right on TV. Where's Kevin? He's sitting next to  On ESPN 2 a buddy of mine  Oh, yeah, there's some kind of um doing a thing about talk radio and sports 
[00:38:30]  On the on cold pizza. Where's Kevin? Oh, there's Kevin is this live  Is this a live show? Yeah, Jay Clark and there's the guy that wanted to hire us really bad, but I just see him make the wacky eyes on TV  Oh, and there's Kevin Straley. We're meeting with Kevin in 15 minutes, so you better hurry up  Kevin should lean over and just start choking Jay. Yeah, we're making out with him  Oh, that'd be really better with that little gray beard on him. That's stupid. See every coop face makes me sick  ESPN 2 if uh, you're listening to us live cold pizza 
[00:39:00]  So he's gonna come from this yeah, he's coming from this? Yeah, he's downtown then  Oh, we better not have to wait too long for a meeting  Well, you'll wait as long as it takes until he gets here because you guys have really been annoying watching  I thought elo was supposed to be on this too. Well elo would have been a much better choice than Kevin  I mean nothing against Kevin, but he looks too nice on that on this show and he probably won't shut up about the goddamn red side  There's michael harrison who loves uh talking about us and talker magazine 
[00:39:30]  Why he hates you guys or he's actually been pretty cool to us all right over the years  Uh, I know I hope so it looks like jeffrey tamborn with  We're watching I'm wig on yeah  We're watching TV that it's just whatever. Well, maybe we'll get the audio played on monday or something  Uh one more story old dirty. What do you think of our our buddy bill maher?  With the african princess  I didn't see that  Ex-accuses hbo star of physical abuse degrading racial comments  A comedian bill maher was slapped yesterday with a nine million dollar palimony suit 
[00:40:00]  By an ex-girlfriend who alleges that the hbo star subjected her to physical and verbal abuse  including insulting humiliating and degrading racial comments kevin looks like he's got his back-to-school haircut as a kid  You know, he got that haircut because he's just for tv. He's gonna be on tv today. Wow. How long has mcgreevy been working for xm radio?  Jesus, what a sissy  Oh, you're terrible 
[00:40:30]  Oh, wow. That was really funny. I would love to know what he's saying right now  But you know just the same way that um, I mean going back to opie story just a quick comment um the same way uh uh  For for a black man a white woman  Was like oh, that's the prize I guess for a white man a woman of color  Yeah, it was also a prize because of the thickness involved and  The thickness  No, I could repeat and when you went to brazil my man this thickness there. I'll be honest 
[00:41:00]  There was a lot of really nice dumpers  You gotta be careful down there because the tranny operations is so good. You gotta watch are you kidding  Number one place in the world for for sexual reassignment surgery. Maybe it's applied to john hopkins and been refused  So they go to brazil and make a million dollars  Yeah, they do that's what they do all the surgery down there because there's no regulations down there  They just you know you take a needle off the street and just shoot into someone's tits with silicone in it  There's no medical regulations  So the sexual reassignment surgery is very good down there right here and and it'll look like a regular badge and then 
[00:41:30]  I'm so paranoid about that though. I pointed to a bunch of my that's a that's a used to be a guy  I mean they're all like no it you didn't I mean yo the good way to do it  It's like take a sniff do it if it smells like fish we're in there  If it don't we out yeah, one thing I know you gotta smell pussy right a pussy smell  Pussy got a certain maybe the girls you're with yeah, I mean all right  It's not gonna smell like a fuck like a fish market, but  I have a certain 
[00:42:00]  That gets a brother funky like I smell it, and I'm like oh, I want to hit that you know  Oh, yeah, baby, you know what I'm talking about no  I do I mean, I I like the armpit smell on certain girls. I'm a I'm a real part of serious certain girls  Only chemically it has to hit me, but there are some girls. I'll lick their armpits if they're sexy  Yo, no, and a couple of days ago this girl was like, oh, um, you know  I was I was banging on shit and she was like, oh put it in my armpit  That's in your actualism  That's what is that axolism? What's that when you don't show up for your gigs in philadelphia? 
[00:42:30]  Three hours late your wig fell off  Psychotic has-been fuck  That's great so lost me on that one wow  Axel oh, Jesus wow  Sorry licking armpits, but he won't eat out of that fucking bowl that someone I won't I won't put my mule in an armpit  That's disgusting. It's silly and there's gonna be stubble  Yeah, actualism is when you have the fetish of having sex with armpits  Yeah, so she was like I'll put it in my armpits. I'm like I'm behind though. She really wanted that dude. I was all up in the armpits 
[00:43:00]  Was she doing this all up in the armpit was she doing this?  Razor elbow up and down it went so  That's a little laugh a little chuckle  Oh  That's funny  I was bugging out  I guess very freaky son  Do you mind hairy armpits? 
[00:43:30]  There's one dominatrix I know has hairy armpits and I'll actually that she doesn't wear deodorant  Oh, I swear to God. I'll smell and lick her armpits  Holy Jesus stop it. Wait a minute. Wait wait wait  Holy Jesus palomino  You're kidding. No, you're kidding. No a girl with unshaven armpits that doesn't wear deodorant  You lick her hairy armpits. This is an extraordinarily rare thing for me to like  There's maybe three or four women in my life I've met that turn me on like that  There has to be a certain chemistry on most people. I would find it as revolting as you do 
[00:44:00]  chemistry  Yeah, and for me it chemically if that body scent hits me like that  It's very rare that it does but if it does I can do it, but on most women I can't you are an animal  You are like an animal with these smells  I can just see you like putting your nose up a chick's ass when she comes in before you pay her  And then doing that dog  Lick thing that they do and the other one will turn around and look like hey, what are you doing back there? 
[00:44:30]  And like put their hindquarters down a little bit  And then they do this  Oh, you creature it's the pheromones  Of course it is  Exactly  Yeah, kids  There you go  You know what I mean  It's edumacation  Well, good doctor old dirty  It's enlightening us  It's the pheromones  That is really twisted  The armpit  But again, that's such a  It has to hit me chemically 
[00:45:00]  It's not like some chicken just show up like that  Because most of them smell awful  It's like, ugh  But occasionally you'll get one that just really hits you  Oh, the ass smell can be really hot  See, he likes the  Only on certain girls  Sometimes it reeks and it's disgusting  I just hate the smells in general though, man  When a girl's been peeing all day  Girls been peeing all day  Yeah, yeah  It's trapped in there  That smell  That's funky right there  That urine smell  You lost me  Smells like bicycle seats  That's the funk, baby  Oh, yeah 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah  Anything else you want to get off your mind there?  Wow, Odie  Damn, bro  Not really  Nothing  Nothing coming to mind  Yeah, my man Ben is the best, dude  He's just feeding the Jaeger  Pretty good first appearance, I must say  Very nice  Am I getting positive reviews?

[00:46:00]  About licking him armpits  Well, that's  That is number one on the list  And it's a precursor to licking ass  I'm  It's just  It's unbelievable  As long as she hadn't  Used deodorant  And then you get that  Nasty ass aluminum  Yes  Aluminum taste in your mouth  That lasts for  Lasts for like  Three, four days  But it is  Yeah, you don't want to pull a little white ball  Off the armpit hair  Like a little deodorant buildup  It's got to be nice and natural  Yeah  I mean, she's got to be clean, too 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, yeah  It's a body smell  Not dirt  Yeah, exactly  It is  It's just wonderful, man  It is  It can be very hot  It's wonderful  It's wonderful  Then right before  Then right afterwards  Is whenever you go around  And then you  And you start from the ass  To the pussy  And then the ass  To the pussy  And then  Oh, man  That's right  You just drag that bacteria  All over  Back and forth  Like a mop  It turns like a mop  All right  Thank you, Jim  There he goes

[00:54:30]  Yeah, he is  Man, maybe you guys should just bang on the show today  Oh, not eight and a half months pregnant  Yeah  Why not?  Are you guys still having sex?  I'm saying we should just bang  Yeah, we had sex last night  He's gotta leave for work  He's saying, I can't bang her  I gotta go to work  You had sex last night?  Yeah, we did  How does an eight and a half month pregnant woman have sex?  You have to be very creative  Really?  Well, it can't be the normal missionary  No, it's definitely not the normal missionary  What are you, on all fours? 
[00:55:00]  On all fours, on top, on the side  On top?  Yeah  Backward cowgirl?  Not backward cowgirl  Don't you worry about damaging the child?  It's gonna come out with dents in his forehead  Oh, that old gag  No, we don't worry about that  No?  No  Doctor said it's okay  Yeah, it's cool for now  So you're horny all the way up to the end, huh? 
[00:55:30]  Apparently  Who knew?  So, alright, so you guys did a doggy style?  A little bit of that, a little bit on the side  A little on the side  What?  Your spoon?  Yeah, a little bit of spooning  A little spooning?  Big fat spoon?  Yeah  And you hear, ah, not there, not there, not there  Okay, alright  Yeah, that's kind of like it, not like that  Oh my god  Oh, alright, and it was, um, and you had, alright, okay  Sure, they had sex last night, Anthony  That's, you know, that's not right  Why? 
[00:56:00]  Why is that not right?  The kid doesn't need to be splashed with that  You know?  It's kind of rude  It's rude  Why not?  Prepare him for grammar school  Yeah, we're not sending him to Catholic school  Wow, alright  Well, I say we play Guess What's in My Pants with the pregnant lady  Sure, why not?  Sure  Alright, so how much do you weigh now?  Way too much  Well, how much?  Probably about 180 pounds  5'6", 180 pounds 
[00:56:30]  I have a humongous belly  I have a big kid inside me  And be honest, how much do you weigh without the kid inside?  Like 138  Alright, not bad  Well, 138 when she's not pregnant, Anthony  5'6", yes  Okay  And are you a brunette?  Yes, I am  And brown eyes?  Green eyes  Damn  Alright, green eyes  Um, I was trying to be Kreskin here  And I'm assuming really big boobs, right? 
[00:57:00]  Double day before pregnancy  Whoa  Holy crap  Those must be a mess right now  I'm awed by your power  She's pregnant  Wow, you must have big breasts  You can see the future, man  It's like he's gazing through her telephone  That's exactly what Kreskin does  That's exactly how Kreskin does  Well, yeah, that's what I was saying  I understand  You have no respect for Kreskin  You should know that if you listen to the show  Stupid Kreskin  Hey, is it your first kid? 
[00:57:30]  Yes, it is  Oh  How old is she?  I'm 37  37?  Career girl, are you?  I'm a career girl  And you guys finally decide what the hell?  Time to have a kid?  Well, we just got married a year ago  So we got busy right away  My career is putting jelly in the jelly donut  Alright, Anthony  I guess you've got to explain the rules of  Guess what's in my pants?  We weren't going to play this today  But, I mean, pregnant lady  You've got to do it  We've got to do it, right?  Yeah, we can't pass this up  It might add some kind of sound  That we have no clue what it is  It could throw us off 
[00:58:00]  It could throw off Jim's fine record he has  Yeah, the game is easy  We'll ask you to rub the phone on that area  Okay  In various directions  Up and down  Side to side  And then the circular motion  And then based solely on the sound it makes  We will try to guess  What hairstyle you're sporting  Okay  The choices  The standard triangle  Which is the standard issue for all women  Okay  The mohawk  Which is like a little mohawk 
[00:58:30]  On an engine's head  Okay  You know, a strip  And then the Hitler mustache  Which is just a little tuft of hair  Okay  In the area  And then all the rage these days  Very popular  The clean-shaved wood floor  JonBenet Ramsey  Or Jim, if you would please  What else is used to describe this type of style  The underside of Connor Peterson's chin  Smooth, sleek, clean  Nary a hair to be found 
[00:59:00]  Okay  And then after we do this  We will ask you what's in your pants  And you will tell us  But don't tell us  Don't give us any clues  No hints  No reaction to our guesses  Until we ask you indeed  What is in your pants  Okay  All right  But first  The theme song  Oh, it's a theme song  It's time to play  It's time to play  It's time to play  Hey, guess what's in my pants 
[00:59:30]  Place the receiver  I'll hum your beaver  It's time to play  Hey, guess what's in my pants  It's time  To guess  What's in my pants  My pants  Shut up  You don't like the song yet?  No, I like the song  Okay  I hit the wrong button  It's supposed to be this one  Stay out the bushes  Yeah, it's going to be a hairy mess down there  You think?  Ah, yeah  She doesn't have time to worry about  Keeping that area clean  I was kind of thinking 
[01:00:00]  What a pregnant woman might do  Yeah  Yeah  All right  If you would please  Take the telephone  Okay  And rub it in an up and down fashion  Up and down  Straight up and down?  Oh, yeah  Okay  Okay  Was that the welcome mat  To your house?  Jesus  Could you do side to side, ma'am?  Yes  Okay 
[01:00:30]  All right  Circular  Circular  Okay  Oh, boy  She wants off the phone so bad at this point  It's tough  I'm just giving a Christmas present to my husband  This is a Christmas present to your husband?  I'm being a pig for him  He's a good egg  Yeah, guys like when their women are pigs for them 
[01:01:00]  Maybe he just wanted a Mi-Fi, though  He would love a Mi-Fi  Of course he would  I'm in a dilemma because I'm thinking that  Well, once you hear one more  Yeah, you know what  You're basing it more on what you're thinking than the sound, though  Yeah, that's true  Just close your eyes, Luke  Use the force  You want to hear up and down or side to side again?  I want to hear side to side again if I could miss  Sure  Ah, very telling  Okay 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, side to side  But I'm distracted by up and down  Up and down doesn't match side to side  Let me hear up and down, please  Okay  See?  Up and down tells me one thing  Side to side tells me another  Which leads me to believe  Okay, I got my guess  There's definitely hair down there  Yeah  Don't tell us yet  I'm going to go with the obvious  She decided just to let it  Let it rock and roll for eight months  Eight and a half months  So it's going to be like  You know, kind of like a natural triangle 
[01:02:00]  All right  I'm going to guess  Mohawk because  I think the fact that they're still banging  She puts some kind of care into it  But the fact she's pregnant is probably a little harder to care for  Just because of the logistics of having the 180 pounds  That's true  So I'm going to guess Mohawk  I, too, because of the consistency of the up and down sound  And then the difference in the side to side sound  Leads me to believe that it is a Mohawk, too  So my guess is Mohawk 
[01:02:30]  Diane, if you would please tell us  What is in your pants?  It is a standard issue  Wow  Opie's got it  Finally  I haven't won one of these in a long time  Why the hell was the sound so different side to side?  That's odd  I don't know  It's very soft  Very soft  So when was the last time you shaved?  About three days ago  I thought you were going to say three years ago  Wow  Wait, what do you mean three days ago?  What did you do three days ago?  Three days ago I trimmed it  And about three weeks ago I had it waxed 
[01:03:00]  Totally bald or no?  No  Oh, okay  Not now  Yeah, pregnancy  Pregnant should have told me that  Because it's too hard to maintain  It's like hell  And what style are you going back to after the kid's born?  Mohawk  Mohawk  Very nice  Mohawk  We don't get any credit for at least seeing that coming?  Nope  All right  Nothing  All right, are we done with her?  Yeah  Thank you  Thank you very much  All right, Diane, thank you  Thank your husband for listening  And happy holidays  Hey, do you know if you have a  Is it a boy or a girl?  It's a boy  Well, good luck  Yeah  Thank you  Enjoy, okay? 
[01:03:30]  Thank you  Name him Connor  Bye  All right, Diane  Bye, guys  Bye  Chubby gals need love, too

[01:07:30]  Starring little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss  Norton killed as usual, but that's besides the point  Effing Voss, he's so whipped he took a call from Bonnie in the middle of his act  It went something like this  During his act, he checked his phone once  And as a cover, he had to make a little hacky cell phone joke  So he says, fucking sprint?  They call it that because you have to run to find service  Waka waka  Ah, there you go  A little while later, someone yelled out  How's Bonnie?  She's okay, she'll be here later  Wait, who said that? 
[01:08:00]  Why am I answering you?  Who's Bonnie?  Near the end of his set, he couldn't grab the phone  Hanging from his pocket to get it to his ear fast enough  Where are you?  You're in New Brunswick?  No, I'm not bombing  You're at the train station?  Turns to the crowd and says  How far is the train station from here?  Yeah  So then the people in the front row were all trying to give him directions for Bonnie  It was a giant clusterfuck  As people were naming the wrong streets and turns  And Bonnie would have ended up a statistic in the paper 
[01:08:30]  So some dude from the crowd had to get up  Go to the train station  And escort her to the club  Are you kidding me?  How effing whipped do you have to be to take a call in the middle of your set from your chick?  Anyway, just wanted to share that with you guys  Aside from that dignity-destroying moment  He had a great set as well  Maybe you could get him on the phone today and see how he defends himself  This is from Lauren  Did you see this last night?  No, I decided I wanted to be responsible and come home and sleep  So you did your set and left?  Had my car jump-started for the second time that night 
[01:09:00]  Because the battery is dead  And then I drove home and backed in  And the stupid PR who works in my thing doesn't understand English  So I'm like, look, just leave it running until you back it in  Oh, no  So I had to stay in the garage while this little failure backs my car in  And then I went upstairs and tossed and turned  And dreamed of Black Sabbath at my birthday party  Yeah  Like a faggot  That's cute  Were you wearing a little party hat?  It was awful  Happy birthday, Jim  Where's the band?  They left  Maybe I can dream next time that's my birthday  And I'm kneeling in a bathroom  And you put your swamp ass in my face 
[01:09:30]  All right, well, we got Rich Voss on the phone  Rich  What's going on?  What happened last night, buddy?  First of all, Norton goes on, he kills  Right  He just destroys  And he does it all the time  He's such a weasel  Yeah  Whenever  Oh, I gotta go on in the middle  Because I gotta get back home, you know  Never  Like the extra half an hour is gonna kill him, you know  I always close those shows  He takes a pride  I mean, he kills  He's funny  He's got a lot of funny stuff  Don't talk about me like I'm not here, stupid 
[01:10:00]  But I'm right here  All right  And the only thing worse than your cell count is your battery  So, okay, 0 for 1  And  Well, but I don't always go on in the middle  I just, I actually, I had a legitimate reason last night  We did a fundraiser at the Stress Factory a couple months ago for Levy  Bob Levy  Yeah, you know what  And I wanna  Shut up and listen  One of our B-comic friends  Right  His wife is leaving him  Because he brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream out of their answers  Wait, who does that?  Bob Levy  Bob Levy  Oh, my God  He brings girls on stage and eats whipped cream 
[01:10:30]  Blue cheese  Oh, blue cheese  And his wife is divorcing him  And he can't imagine why  That's gonna be fun in court when that comes up  I know, with no pictures, right?  So we do a fundraiser  And Levy goes on  And he kills, but he's filthy  And Norah's like  I don't wanna go on after him  Can you follow him?  Yeah  And then I'll go, okay  You know, he's too dirty  And Norah, you know  I didn't say he was too dirty  No, I didn't  What would you say?  I never could follow Levy historically in my career  He's the one guy  I was always  Never wanted to go on after 
[01:11:00]  Well, you know what?  To get over your fears  You have to do things like that  Well, sorry  I can't host every show like you do  I'll host  Oh, you fucking Bob Eubanks  Every show you do  You wanna host  You're right  I wanna host  Because I know how to  Shut up  Shut up  So last time he goes on  And he destroys  It's just really funny fluid comedy  A lot of stuff about his fluids  And different diseases  Sure  Destroys, right?  So I go on after him  Sure  Right  And, you know  I do an hour  No problem 
[01:11:30]  You know, you can follow him  You can follow that kind of humor  You just do stuff with punchlines  Yeah  So, where are you from?  Yeah  I didn't work  Stuff with punchlines  What are you drinking?  So during this  Well, I'm not to interrupt you  But I'm sorry  I had to get out of there  But I was running late  My cell phone wasn't working  So I had to sprint for service  Or did you have to check your RSVP list  To see if Black Sabbath is coming to the party  That's a true story  I had a little dream 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, you had a little dream  Black Sabbath must have been really upset  That they were all wet on in the face  I can see upset little Jimmy in his dream  That Black Sabbath wasn't at his party  They were at the party  And then he threw me a party  Yeah  And there was a special treat  And then Sabbath left  Did you tell me how to leave the party early  Because you had to get up for work?  Sorry  Anyhow, so  I don't like the fact  That you almost named somebody in Sabbath  And realized you couldn't  I know  I forgot the guy's name  Sorry, guitar player  I can't believe you grabbed that one 
[01:12:30]  Wow  So I'm on stage  You know  And I get a phone  Now  My girlfriend is  Coming from New York  On a train  Which she's never done  Okay, she's from Canada  And she was coming from New York  From her Letterman audition  When she got the show  And  You know  I never took the train  From New York to New Brunswick either  So  You know 
[01:13:00]  I get a call on stage  And I kind of thought  It might be her  You know  You know  New Brunswick is in a place  You want some little white girl  Walking around  And she got off  You know  Off  Off the  Off the train  And I said  Where are you?  You know  I was wondering  Look  I was already at  50 something  This was during your act though  I don't really have an act  Thank God  He's finally admitting it  Okay  Jesus  And  You know  This was right before  You know  I was going to say  You know  You can get my new DVD 
[01:13:30]  To the audience  And  You got a new DVD  At richfoss.com?  Yeah  It's just  Yeah  And I guess  The first people I thank  On the DVD  Is my good friends  Opie and Anthony  Who  You know  I don't call in the morning  Just to thrash them  And trash them  Because  Their girl calls them  So she called  And I said  You know  I try to get her directions  And people got up  From  You know  The audience  And started walking out  To go find her  Not to help me  Because she's hot  You know  And maybe they have a shot  In three blocks  So 
[01:14:00]  You know  One guy  Goes out  And she tells me  Some guy comes up  And goes  I'm a cop  You know  He shows his badge  And  You know  And they walk her over  To the  And this  Sprint joke  Is not a hacky joke  That's a funny joke  I didn't say it was hacky  I don't know  Whoever called  And wrote in  You know  But now  We're getting a lot of people  That's saying  You're kind of  Pussy whipped now  With Bonnie  Well  Do you blame him  Jesus  Well  But what's the  You know  What do you mean  You know  Finally a guy  You know  A guy is happy

[01:15:00]  The phone keeps ringing  Because they're in love  It keeps ringing  And he keeps answering  And I'm like  Could you be a fucking guy  For once  He would just answer  Every time  I'm in the middle of telling  A great Hummer story  And how the guy reacted  When I gave it  And like  As we're driving to Albany  He goes  Can you be a guy  And pull into this rest area  And pull over in the room  Here's the thing  Oh  Hold on  Hold on  Hi poofy  Yes  Nookums  No  Just driving with Jimmy  Okay

[01:24:00]  Is it enough?  Gone!  There it is!  62!  The memories  Unbelievable!  A home run for Gibson  And the Dodgers have won the game  5-4  I don't believe what I just saw  The mental  The passion is renewed this February  As spring training opens for the 2005 season  The hopes and dreams of 30 Major League teams  Are told on XM Satellite Radio

[01:25:30]  Is 70 miles an hour  Unless you're in an 18-wheeler  Then it's 65 miles an hour  Unless it's at night  Then it's 60 miles an hour  Unless you're in a car  Pulling a big trailer  Then it's 55 miles an hour  And they do this, of course  Because having everybody drive  The same speed on the same road  Just doesn't make sense 
[01:26:00]  I'm surprised they make them drive  The same direction  How about you?  I couldn't spell  When I was a little kid  I couldn't spell  So my parents got all concerned  So they went down to the toy store  They bought me a little red box 
[01:26:30]  Called Speak and Spell  You remember that?  Speak and Spell?  They shouldn't have called it Speak and Spell  But they should have called it Speak  Like the Devil  Remember the voice?

Jimmy, did you just fart again?  I thought I heard a  That was hilarious during the video  I thought I heard  You really are a buzzkill though  You ruin everything for everybody  We're kind of getting into it  She's moaning  She's like really getting it 
[01:28:30]  And Jimmy's laughing  Giggling like a retard  And we hit the button  So she can't hear it  So it doesn't completely ruin it  And Jimmy's like  I farted  Kindergarten  The worst farts ever  Oh, he does it in the building  Where he'll be in the elevator  And he'll just crack one out  And then get off  And then the people  Are just sitting there like  Ugh  It's like he went into a funeral home  And ate the ass of a cadaver  And then farted out  Whatever happened inside of him  And what did he do in the elevator?  Was it yesterday or the day before  Where we wanted to freaking disappear? 
[01:29:00]  We were talking  He does it all the time  Yeah, but it was something I said  And then  What the hell was it?  I don't remember  Ugh, whatever  I got in the elevator the other day  And some business guy is in there  And right as the doors are closing  Jimmy comes running towards the door  Wait, sweetie, sweetie  Sweetie  And the door shuts  And now I'm in there  With this business guy  Who's looking at me  Like Jimmy was yelling sweetie at me  And I just kind of glanced  And I'm like  That guy's a kook 
[01:29:30]  Like it doesn't take away  That he was yelling sweetie, sweetie  So Bob  Did you like the gift?  Oh, you rock  I wanted to give you something  That you couldn't throw in my face  Like poker chips  You  Do you know  There's a line  There's no line with me  I know  But that's what I'm saying  Like other people can  Can hold the baby  And not throw it  I wouldn't throw the baby  You're the type of guy  That would just huck a kid  I wouldn't throw the baby  I would just poke at it  You should see Opie's house 
[01:30:00]  At Christmas time  He's just heaving gifts  At people's faces  There's no gifts  He doesn't have chairs  At his house  He doesn't have gifts  No, Santa doesn't stop  At his house  No, he doesn't  That was the worst video  I felt  I cringed  Oh, we haven't talked to you  Since the poker video?  No  Last time I was on here  There was a wiffle ball bat  And a girl's twat  Yeah, that was great  I was in shock for like two days  We're going to do some kind of  Thanksgiving feast  On this calendar next week  We are  Yeah, girls eating Thanksgiving  Crap off each other  I guess  Food and sex 
[01:30:30]  Never mix  It is disgusting  Everyone goes  Oh, you ever see that movie  Nine and a half weeks  It's so hot  No, it's not hot  It's not about  You've been brainwashed  Into thinking it's hot  It's in actuality  Disgusting  We didn't say it was going to be a hot bit  It's going to be a silly bit  It's disgusting  It's silly  Chocolate  And they pour chocolate  And it looks like shit  Shit  Just all over  You're right  There are times where it's cool  But I mean  Most times it's awful  All right, baby  I'm going to wrap a shrimp  Around my cock  Did you hear me?  I just did a show in Tempe 
[01:31:00]  And I did all this  Regular terrestrial radio  As you guys say  Which I love that term  Yeah, you almost stopped saying shit  I almost  I went shit  Shit  That mic's over-modulating  Way too much  Maybe we can bring it down a little bit  What's modulating mean?  It's like over-modulating  Yeah, try it  Modulating  You should be better now  Am I modulating better?  All right, let's get back to the poker chip video  Who's that hot girl out there, by the way?  I don't know  She's from my evil  Oh, that's Yoshi's boss  She's an evil angel  She's bringing us porn  But she's not  Oh, okay  She doesn't do anything  She's not doing anything 
[01:31:30]  I already went back  That is for porn  Really?  She's bringing porn?  Our goal is to get everyone to hum this song over the weekend when they don't want to  So, getting back to the poker chip video, though  Tell me that wasn't one of the funniest things you've ever seen after the uncomfortable moment  I've never felt an uncomfortable moment like that, really  Because, you know, I've seen some pretty atrocious stuff  I mean, I've seen  We've made girls cry at the cellar and just leave  And we all applaud as they leave  I mean, I've seen uncomfortable  That really made me cringe 
[01:32:00]  And made me think about, like, what am I doing?  Am I a nice guy?  You are a nice guy if you cringe  Yeah, but the people I know  It's like, what?  I know, Opie  Is this wrong with me for knowing this guy?  You're right  You get those feelings sometimes  It's like, this is, you know  I didn't have any problem doing it  Sometimes I've got to look at the bigger picture of life  And this is just a bad problem  I didn't have any problem doing it  And it just made me laugh harder than I've ever laughed in my life  And then to see him turn completely red Norton  And he couldn't look at her  And then Anthony was literally looking out the window 
[01:32:30]  Oh, I couldn't take it  Do you understand the sound of the poker chips?  Yeah  It's just, I mean, you know how hard it is to get  That box of poker chips, that's a pretty nice  I've tried to get poker chips  That's a pretty nice gift  That is an awful gift, Bob  Let me see  That is horrid  And look, that's the famous poker chip  You can go online right now  And get real chips like you play with in real casinos  Those are cheap  That cheesy plastic chips  And some wood thing that looks like it was from the 60s  But that's probably worth money  Those are hard to find  No, they're not hard to find 
[01:33:00]  The only thing would have been made that worse  If you made her actually pick up all the poker chips  After you did that to her  And put them back in there  Well, Anthony's screaming lines from the Godfather  No, clean it up  You guinea bread  And she didn't know it was like  Lies from the Godfather  So he's just bad  Yeah, she thought I was really yelling at her  Right  Go show Carlo the trick  The trick  And then she ran out crying  I was going to say the chips  And I almost said the tree like the movie  The trick  Oh, I stink  Well, the video is  I think it's still up on  OpieandAnthony.com  And foundrymusic.com  And next week we're going to take a couple days off 
[01:33:30]  That's definitely one of the bits we're going to replay  Because a lot of new people  Just tuning in the show  That's one you definitely got to check out  I have an uncomfortable bit on my website  When me and Colin Quinn were in Japan  Doing the tour  We went to this Japanese garden  And it was like  You know, so peaceful  And all these little things  You pick up rocks and put them on  And you say a prayer  And tie a thing to a tree  Oh, I knock down those things  When I'm going hiking  So we go over this bridge  And there's a little pond 
[01:34:00]  And there's one beautiful  Like 10 pound swan  With turtles  And, you know  Fish coming up  And this  Spiritual  Yeah, it was just unbelievable  Little Asian ladies  Dressed in the geisha girl  Like clicking across the bridge  And I'm like  Wow, this is amazing  Clicking away with my camera  And I look  And Colin goes on the top of the bridge  And he's like  He's looking at the swan  And he's like  Wow, what a beautiful swan  This lunatic takes a quarter  Out of his pocket  And hums it at the swan's chest  And all you hear is 
[01:34:30]  And then runs like a friggin' nine-year-old  And just takes off  What an ass  I was like in shock  A true ass  I'm like, did you just throw a quarter  At a friggin' swan's  And you just heard it go  And just bury into the swan's chest  Oh, he's a friggin' loser  Could not appreciate a moment like that  Oh, and then you get  And the USO lady  Who's like a total, you know  Fat chick  Peace activist  Who hated us  Day one  Me, Nick DiPaolo, and Colin 
[01:35:00]  Hated our guts  I could see that  Caught us talking shit about her  She's up a window upstairs  And we're just going  That fat moose  This fatso  She's annoying  And then I go like this  I just go upstairs  Her window's wide open  All of a sudden  You hear this fatso  Coming down the stairs  Hey guys  If I've said anything  To offend you  I apologize  And I really didn't mean it  But you know what  You know  You don't have to talk about me  Behind my back  And Nick goes  Well, that apology was nice  Until you said that  Ruined it with the end piece 
[01:35:30]  I was like  Jesus  You're such a dick  Look how comfortable he feels  Because he gave us a girl  He's holding his coffee  All confident  Because he knows  He's got a buy  Listen to me  He's done  He did his job  There's nothing I can do to you  You helped the show  You do make me nervous, Hopi  I know  You do  Because outside  I know that  Outside the studio  It's like  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  But the last time we hung out  For like the year I've known you  The last time we hung out  You started slamming me  About my ankles  And started picking me apart  I was like  Something's changed 
[01:36:00]  Your ankles?  What happened?  Because I knew you were going to be back on the show  Or  Did he  Yeah  Did you  No, he never done the show  I've never done the show  Wow  You locked his ankles?  Yeah  I just had to show him who was boss  Because I knew we were going back on the radio soon  And I didn't want him to get any ideas  That he could  You know something?  What?  I got the same problem  You too?  And I think it's the socks  It's the socks  No, man  Anthony, I love you, man  It's the socks  Not the socks  It's the socks  Because he wears like capri pants  Because you have baby blonde hair, Opie 
[01:36:30]  I don't wear capri pants  No, he does  Do you shave your thing?  No  I don't shave his  I don't shave my ankles  It's because we have man, black, Italian hair  I got it right  And he has baby blonde hair  And sometimes, I don't understand  With the socks  Norton has no hair  You have no hair anyway  You know what's hilarious about Norton?  The only muscle on his body is his calf  I have bully pin calves, ladies  Line up  That's all he's got  That's the only muscle  Ben is very hairy  Ben, where you pull your socks up  Is there hair under it? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, he has hair  Wait, you have that same problem?  I'm a little mangy under my sock  I am too  Why is that?  Because of socks  You wore socks your whole life  It sweats  It kills the poor  And then the socks die off  I mean, the hair dies off  The cirques  So I guess you wore a lot of hats growing up?  I got a little bit  You friggin' douche  I really  I got a little  A few whiskey ones  You have bangs, Opie  Well, yeah  Friggin' hearty boy  Listen 
[01:37:30]  There's a few wispy hairs under my sock  But it looks like a chemo patient's head  Under there  Or the chicken you get in the supermarket  Where there's just a few remaining hairs  The cheap chicken  Where there's some hair still on it  The Chinese chicken  Let's go to Gio in New York  Gio  Hey, what's up, guys?  Norton, you suck  I'm trying to whack one out  You're farting in the studio  I'm sorry, Gio  I didn't mean to  It just slipped out  I got excited  You know what?  Because it has to be about Norton  That's not true  It is true  We were all enjoying a special moment  We were all bonding 
[01:38:00]  And you had a fart  I couldn't help it  You couldn't walk out of the studio  At that point?  Absolutely not  What kind of self-respecting guy  Walks out of a studio and farts?  He does it at my house  I'll invite him over for dinner  Me and my girlfriend  The dogs  And he'll cut one out at the house  In front of my girlfriend  No guy walks out  You can't walk out in a far  You can't do it  All right  You should  Now, what kind of guy would I be?  Glenn and PA, what's up?  Nice one  Oh, not much  I called up to a bitch about Norton  Why, Glenn?  Because you're a scumbag  And you ruin everything  That's fucking sexy on the show  You turn everything gay 
[01:38:30]  Or about you  And you fucking suck  There you go  Now, tell me what you mean  I'm not sure what you mean  Every time something good's going on the show  You don't know when to shut up  And let the professionals  Like Opie and Anthony  Handle the show  You gotta just be in there  And get your shit in there  And it's all about you  And you fuck it all up  Every time  Now, hold on  Now, let me have some examples  Like right now  With the farting  Okay, well I didn't actually say anything  All right  Starting the show two days ago  With the farting  Okay  And during the  Guess what's in my pants  You started with all the questions  Because you want to know 
[01:39:00]  About the girls  Like you're trying to  You know  Talk to a girl  I'm on the internet later  Or something  I will agree  You gotta pick up on these girls  Every time  Absolutely  So you just  But you just said  I did gay stuff  But now you're accusing me  Of hitting on the girls too much  You gotta be consistent, Glenn  Well, I'm just expecting you  To start ragging on my mother  Or something like you did  With the guy last week  That called up bitching about you  No, I don't  Oh, is that what you want?  Yeah, and I don't just  Trip on somebody's mother  Without due cause  All right  If you have a justifiable complaint  I will let you trash me  And I'm actually surprised  Nobody played this for you 
[01:39:30]  I don't know  What is he playing?  I don't know  What is that?  Was he doing a line from a movie?  I don't know  Oh  Are you trying to play sound effects?  No, he's gone now  I feel more uncomfortable  Than the chip thing now  Why?  Isn't that awful?  Just let him bury himself  What an awful caller  Awful  Just let it sit  Let him sit in his unfunniness  You guys want to hear anything  Into break?  Anything we haven't played in a while? 
[01:40:00]  I like that cunt song  You didn't give the warning  We didn't know it was coming  Wow  Why you can't say that?  Battle stations  Battle stations  This whole warning  Oh, you could say it  You could say it  But we have to play the warning first  We're trying to be more female friendly  You gotta raise your hand or something  To give us the sign  That you want to go there  And then we play this silly thing  Warning  Warning  C-word alert  C-word alert  Warning  Warning  Can I say it now?  We're trying to get more women listeners  I want to hear the cunt song 
[01:40:30]  There you go  Trying to be more female friendly  So if they hear the warning  They can shield their eyes  Or ears  I apologize ladies out there  I apologize  Jimmy, you like this one here?  Oh my god, yeah  I like that  There's a clip of a fat puss going around  It's called hamburger  Or it's called cheeseburger  But no, no  This chick is so hot  And the lips are not  It's not dangling  There's a guy just pinching them between his fingers  They're just really fat  But they're very tight and firm  Yeah  I call it muppet mouth  See, that's good  Yeah, it's definitely a muppet mouth 
[01:41:00]  Absolutely  That's exactly  Yeah, exactly  It does look like Curious George's face  I love that  Sideways  You really like it like that?  Fatter even  Yeah  That's not bad  As long as there's nothing hanging out of it  I don't mind that either  I don't like looking like the roast beef exploded on the deli slicer  You know, one of those  He showed me a picture of what he likes  It actually had, the clitoris had a penis head  Did it?  It looked like a penis head  That's the rare exception  Like a little helmet  That's the rare exception of the two inch clip  That's very rare 
[01:41:30]  He showed me one  And it was painted like Kiss  Like the  Had a Paul Stanley  Had a little star over the clip  Star on it  And it beat him  And then cuddled with him  He's sick fuck  I would talk  But I don't want to ruin it for Glenn  Yeah, don't ruin it for Glenn  Real fast  I want to acknowledge Stingray from Whackbag.com  He did a great job yesterday  Stingray, huh?

[01:42:30]  You have like a gambling thing  You wanted to talk about or something?

[01:44:00]  Very obvious  I want a little like extension  Built around his area  A mule hider  Yes  Like a sneeze guard  Exactly  A mule guard  It's perfect height  Where he can just like  Plop it on the table  Like a sparrow  He lays it on there  I do rub it against this thing  It's perfect  I'll have some of the  Norton wiener  You can't out gay Norton though  It's not a gay thing  When I do that  I'm usually turned out by a woman  It's not like I'm just  You can't  If you try to  He'll try to hug me or something  I understand what Bob Kelly's saying though  You know  Out gay  I mean you like to try to get that reaction 
[01:44:30]  By doing something  That would be perceived as gay  No I don't  One time I actually  You know  He does gay things once in a while  And it freaks you out  And one time I was like  You know what  I'm going to out gay him  And I actually  You can't out gay him  I stuck my finger  Right near his butt  And he actually  Stopped and backed up  And my finger went in his asshole  And I  I just  How many knuckles  Did he get in there  It was one and a half  Yeah  It was like a little shrimp  I could actually bend my finger  That did not happen  He just stopped 
[01:45:00]  And then he went like this  Ooh  He tried to put his finger by my ass  And it's like  Look you're going to learn a lesson  The hard way  Why is your pants down at this point  No no no  My pants were on  Easy  Easy  We were just walking out  The hallway of the apartment  I asked how many knuckles you took  You took a knuckle and a half  Through the jeans  I would actually take something real  Enhance it  Exaggerate it  Therein lies the ha ha  Yeah he didn't mean  I didn't mean I stuck my finger in his ass  That would be gay  Wouldn't it  He put it against my ass  I just backed up against it  To teach him who was boss  Well you should have told me  It was exaggerated humor  We don't know  I thought that's what humor was 
[01:45:30]  Not all the time  Really  What's the other type of humor  Dude we've all seen him naked  So it was quite possible  That that actually happened  I've seen him  Don't look at me like I'm an alien  That's an exaggeration too  I've never seen Jimmy Naked  There you go  Alright show him your hug  I don't want him  No I won't show him my hug  I don't want to see Jimmy Naked  I love the face he gets  When he gets  I was actually in  With him one time  And he gets this face  His eyes just open wide  And they turned  His head turns down  And his upper lip goes  Underneath his back tooth  And he just looks like 
[01:46:00]  A little troll  And he just doesn't blink  Like Christopher Walken  In a scene  And he just stares at the girl  Like yeah  Yeah it is nasty  Oh he does  It's just evil  He is his little body  Alright you know  No one's really  Screening the calls today  The behind the scenes  People are very very slow  Everyone's tired today  We're all tired  Hello who's this  Oh  That was good  A hang up  I was on that line  I'm going to do it myself  Hello who's this 
[01:46:30]  Hello  Hey  Oh  What  Hey Opie  Yeah  Oh what's going on  Hi fella  I was going to set up  For what did I learn  But it's a little too early  Yeah  I was going to hold on  Hold for a while  But  You were going to hope  To hold for about  45 minutes  I guess  I'll do one a little early  For some reason  Jimmy Norton plays  Monster Rain just fine  But today  A little sticky banana juice  Got his nerves up  For some reason  Yeah that's true 
[01:47:00]  It is alright  Inconsistent  But it freaked me  I didn't know what it was  It was probably sitting  In the deli or something  And god knows what  Those savages spill  On their fruit  By the way  We did get a brand new  Monster Rain song  How many is that  This is at least  Number four  Oh my god  It's not that  It's  It's  It's bad  Is it bad  Listen we'll all judge  Alright  Another Monster Rain song  We weren't going to go to it  But  The guys are kind of  Asleep behind the scenes today  So  That's right look at them  Look at them  They're not even moving  They all  You know what it is  They want to be punished  They need discipline 
[01:47:30]  This damn rent boys thing  Has backfired  Now everybody's fucking off  Hoping to get a reading  Steve records the thing  In stereo  We need the phone screened  Isn't it obvious  We're suffering here  Yeah we're tired  Get fucking people  On the phones  I'm not even kidding  Get them on the phone Ben  No one is screening  The calls really  It's like  Like slow motion  Get my mother back  On the phone  Have her do that  What's my task thing again  We got  We got six phone lines ringing  We got two guys  That have been sitting  And  It's nothing we want to go to  It's boring shit  Here's the Monster Rain song 
[01:48:00]  Tell me when to stop  Let's give a listen  It really is bad  Let's listen along  Oh  Neil Diamond  Is it done to Neil Diamond  Love on the porch  So far so good  I was surprised  A little drizzle  And out came his lies 
[01:48:30]  What?  Come run with me  Before the dark  Takes the sky  It's getting a little abstract  I think  Real lines  Gave me a little teeth  And played with my own 
[01:49:00]  Innocence gone  But I gave Jimmy  His spot  It's a little rough  Give it like 30 more seconds  Big card  First the skies  They're blocking  Then Jimmy starts his talking  Suddenly you're under the porch 
[01:49:30]  Hiding from the storm  The fear makes him have you  That he wants to have you  Nothing you can do or say  Once he starts  You have to stay  It's the Monster Rain  This guy's all over the place  Did we end it?  End it?  Give me what I need  Yeah  He's breaking all the rules 
[01:50:00]  He's breaking all the parody rules  Yeah  He's really singing  Some of the parody rules  Are like  First of all  You gotta be able to hear  What you're saying  There's a couple of lines there  That were a little  Wuffled  Yeah  You couldn't really hear it  Second one  You don't use that many  Of the lines  From the real song  Right  The guy's using too many  Of the real words to the song  It's like a parody  Slash audition  As a real singer  Yeah  Neil Diamond cover band  Well it's dug out Doug 
[01:50:30]  Did you ever come up with  He does a pretty good  Neil Diamond  I'll say  Did you ever have  A Monster Rain story  Did you come up with one yet?  No  You heard my story right?  No  What was yours?  Oh you weren't listening  The other day  He had the marshmallow  In the frat house  Which people are saying  Is just as bad  As the Monster Rain story  Of course it is  I was out in Arizona  Last week  I missed the whole show  It's one of those things  Where you're hazing  For a fraternity  And one of the things  He had to do  Is pull the pants down  Pick up a marshmallow  Yeah  With his ass  Without using my hands  And drop it on 
[01:51:00]  A little mock  A rivalry  Fraternity house  Frat house  And then no one ate it?  No  No you sick ass  Come on  But it's a room full  Of guys  With their pants down  It's a room full of guys  With their pants down  Picking up things  With their buttholes  Look who said that  The guy that put a finger  In my ass  Well he didn't  Well I guess my cracky did  No you had your pants on  Yeah but I felt  The actual shrimp haul  The actual  Separation  Yeah the separation  I'm guessing there's  A Bob Kelly story  That bombs you? 
[01:51:30]  I thought it was a little odd  That frats do things like that  And have guys in these  Nude circumstances  Doing things  Yeah I think  There's definitely  A Bob Kelly story  Yeah there's definitely  A Bob Kelly story  Now let me just get this straight  Is it like just pure molestation  Does it have to be a guy  Or can it be a girl  Or an aunt  No we all have girl stories  How old would the boy be  And how old would the aunt be  Oh jeez  What the hell is an aunt  I don't like it either  It's from Boston  I'm from aunt 
[01:52:00]  It's an aunt  Aunt  What do you say aunt  Yeah we say aunt  If I say aunt  Then he's going to go what  And then it's going to be  Like a whole back and forth  You know who's on first  Aunt what  Oh marshmallios  Listen  My aunt aunt  What  What  Aunt  I've done a couple things  Yeah  I guess we were talking  About things that could be  Yeah you got to do the gay one  Looked at as  Yeah  A little gee  A little gay  A little gee  Well I used to  I got shards of glass  In my hand  You broke it  You broke a CD  And it just made 
[01:52:30]  Shards  Yeah right  Yeah I'll be right  That's what you get  Alright relax  Easy  And I should settle down  Settle down  Now what do you got  Settle down  Why don't you settle down  Find a girl like Henry  Tell us your gay story  It's not gay  Only the good half  It's not gay because it was young  Settle down every night ma  It was young  You were young  Yeah well that's  That's the whole  Monster ain't excuse  Jimmy gives  Is it's not gay  Because he was young  Well it's true  Everybody  Everybody  Five  Four out of five  Young boys  Have done stuff 
[01:53:00]  With their buddies  Peepees  When they're young  Because you don't know  What sex is yet  That's what my therapist  Told me  Really  Yeah that it's  Pretty natural  Really  So when you were  How old were you  And whatever  So I guess I'm not normal  Oh yeah you are  You're so normal  You probably repressed it  But there's a normal memory  I honestly couldn't  Couldn't give you one though  It's gonna come out someday  I don't know  I forgot all about  The marshmallow story  So I guess we'll see  I'm sure there's more in there  Alright go ahead  How old were you  How old was I  I think I was  I had to be in first grade  First grade  First grade

[01:56:30]  Each other's cocks  And being friends  Well the more  The more I look at it  The more I realize  That there probably  Was no such thing  As monster rain  I've come to that  Conclusion  Oh really  You're backing out  Of stuff now  What are you saying  No I didn't know  I didn't know that  You guys grew up together  No easy  What I was saying  If me and him  Were buddies  When we were a kid  We'd have some  Dude remember that  Time I banged you  In your ass  Alright listen  That wasn't gay  I talked to my therapist  That's not gay  We just didn't know  Any better  We're friends  You know  Alright so  So you and your friend  Would lie on the couch  We'd lie on the couch  Just before I  How old was he 
[01:57:00]  13  No I'm joking  He was  Ah shit  We had to be  We had to be  How old are you  In 5th grade  How old are you  In 5th grade  11  I don't know  Depends what color you are  No not 11  11  No he wasn't 11  What color you are  You were 11 years old  Hang on  I didn't even hear that  That's so bad  That's good  You were 11  I wasn't  Opie it's not 11  Cause I was in  You graduate  6th grade  You're 12 years old right  Yeah  So you're 11  In 5th grade 
[01:57:30]  It must have been  You were 11  4th grade  I wasn't 11  Cause I started drinking  At 11  10 or 11  And I wasn't drinking then  Of course you started drinking  This is my first addiction  This is my first addiction  Then I moved on to booze  So what happened  When you were almost a teenager  Laying on the couch  You lie on the couch  We just lie there  And this is when  Remember when you first  Started jerking off  You used Vaseline  Yes  Remember like petroleum jelly  Sure  Like waterproof your dick  For like 3 days  Just jump in the shower  To wash it off  And it would just beat up 
[01:58:00]  Just looking for anything  Slippery at that age  Didn't matter  Run around like a monkey  Just looking what  Pancake batter  I don't care  Whatever works  I jerked off with anything  Anything  Anything  I used to jerk off  With the Juergens  And I'd fuck the sink  You ever fuck the sink?  I can't say I've ever done that  If you ever want to jerk off  And it feels like  You're fucking somebody  You get on  You know the big long sinks  In the bathroom  The counter  Yeah  Right  You have to have  You can't have like  A pedestal sink  How small is your dick?

[01:59:00]  I swear to god  I'm not going to be able  To look at a sink ever again  No  That is brilliant  Because there's no clean up  You're getting  You're able to use  Your whole body in it  You open your eyes  And you're looking  Right at yourself in the mirror  How fucking creepy is that?  As a fat bald chick  I'm fucking  I got caught in rehab  When I went to rehab  I got caught fucking the sink  I used to fuck the sink  During our group sessions  Because I know everybody  Was in the group  So one time 
[01:59:30]  I guess somebody snapped in group  And they had to end group early  And I'm in the bathroom  Fucking the sink  And there was like a crack in the door  And all of a sudden  I just hear giggling  And like all ten guys  From my rehab house  Oh man  Were in there  They were just watching me  Fuck the sink  It was just awful  So you still do that?  I haven't done it  Because I have a pedestal sink now  You can't do that  Yeah you can't do that  I'm too fat to balance myself  On a pedestal sink  But yeah I've done it  I've done it in hotel rooms  You ever go in the hotels  You have to go in the cheesy hotels 
[02:00:00]  But the suite  In like a cheesy hotel  Yeah  Always has that big long counter  With one sink  Little sink in the middle  Perfect  Just jump up on top  You lube your hand up  Don't  Don't lube your dick up  No?  No because you want  To lube just the inside  Of your hand  Put it on there  And then when you push it in  It's like cracking the seal  Of a real pussy  What the hell is going on?  You want a little resistance  You want a little resistance  Because it cracks it  And you're like  Oh  And it feels like  You're cracking the seal  Of a stink wrinkle  Just as it's going in  Oh it's unbelievable  Right now

[02:10:30]  Would enter my head  And I would get so uncomfortable  It almost came out  Like I just wanted to like tell them  They would throw me out of this  Oh I'd be killed  They'd beat the hell out of me  Alright so you're 13  She's 7  No no no no  She's my age  You freaking lunatic  Stop enhancing the story  That's why there was a question mark  I can't believe he can make the stories worse  But he is  There was a question mark  Was she 7?

[02:12:00]  So  She's a girl  Oh yeah  Sure she is  She's just a little retarded  And she claps like this  With her wrists  But  So I took her in the basement  I made her jerk me off  With that  That old  Really  Harsh soap  With the  Like the little grains of  Lava?  Yeah  Lava soap  That you wash oil off your hands  You love punishing yourself  It's got granules in it  Yeah right  Exactly  How?

[02:16:00]  Where it'll be forever?  The Nody track  Where you see me in the glider  And that thing that goes back and forth like that  I got the idea by smoking a lot of pot  And then I slid across the minoleum floor  To get some Captain Crunch  And that's where I came up with a lazy fuck  My aerobic system  I meant  I meant Billy Blanks  I meant that Billy Blanks guy  Come on, man, let's go  Come on, yeah  Those girls 
[02:16:30]  Come on, yeah  That guy looks like a crook  He should have crime aerobics or some shit  Let's run for the police, everybody  Let's run for the police  There you go  Run for the police  Alright, okay, let's walk  Let's cause no attention  Come on, let's walk  Okay, let's run for the police  Let's climb the fence  Let's climb the fence  Let's grab the purse  Let's grab the purse  Let's stash the dough  Let's stash the dough  I want you to be sweating  Like you got mace in your face, bitch  Come on, let's go  Your system 
[02:17:00]  I can do it  Speaking of animals  Of course, the news, I guess  Of the month  Or maybe even the year now  Is that sheep that they cloned  They're cloning animals  And they're talking about  Maybe they can clone humans  Which I think is a good idea  Because I would like to clone myself  Because I would like to have sex with myself  Hey, I know what I like 
[02:17:30]  I'm going to have a lot of fun  And save a lot of time  It's the O&A virus  XM 202  XM News  Talk  Sports  And information  It's everything  All the time  Say, Jim  What can I feel?  The worst  Of Opie and Anthony 
[02:18:00]  There's some sexual reference  And I know we're not going to talk about this today  But can I just say  Oh, I forgot about that  No, we don't have to talk about it  I just want to say the guy who's  Because I showed Ant the book  And he threw it on the floor  Yeah, that's why we were laughing earlier  I forgot about that  I take it that's an ixnay on the discussion A  But the guy who sent in the big book of boy stuff  Bart King  Yeah  Says FBI approved on the front  Federal Burping Institute  That's funny  Oh, I missed that  Are you kidding?  I threw the book and I missed that line 
[02:18:30]  Let me see that  That is something  Federal Burping Institute  It's the big book of boy stuff  And I guess it's supposed to be  A whole book of things that interest guys  Yeah  Looks like a textbook  The back one's got a funny line on though  Oh, what does it say?  It says  CIA manual 
[02:19:00]  But then it says CIA is craniums in adversity  I don't get it  I don't really get it either  It smells good, the book, right?  It smells like the first day of school  I'm going through the book  And I don't really see anything  I would want to read to anybody  That does smell good  I'd rather read more Cindy Adams stuff  I'll just smell the book  Yep  The writing stinks  But the book smells good  Doodah 
[02:19:30]  Doodah  Indoor games  What is it about a pocket knife that we like?  They have sharp blades  And they fold up and fit in our pocket  They're fun to hold  And to goof around with  And of course the pocket tools  Like the Leatherman Pocket Survival Tool  Are also cool  Folding pocket knives were made  2,000 years ago for Roman soldiers  These old knives had folding blades 
[02:20:00]  And many attachments  Include  What?  Pooping and peeing, Anthony  Some people think that  That you should not poop in the woods  Because there are plenty of logs there already  Hello?  Hello?  Nevertheless  When you have to go  You have to go  And nature calls a lot louder  When you're out in it  A good rule of thumb  For pooping and peeing  Is to take care of your business  At least 100 feet from camp  Peeing 
[02:20:30]  Here are the most important words  You will ever read  Don't pee into the campfire  The smell will be awful  And everyone will hate you  Pee where nobody will be disturbed by you  But don't get lost  Think of how embarrassing that would be  If you got lost while going for a pee  It's as embarrassing as having your name  As author of that book  And then it's  Then he has a scenario  Father says  How did you get lost, Timmy?  Timmy says  I was going to take a pee  And the next thing I knew  I was lost  Father says  Why didn't you let me go with you?  Timmy says 
[02:21:00]  Because the last time we did that  You raped me by a tree  Yeah  Some male campers  Just keep a wide mouth jug  Near their sleeping bag  In case they have to go  During the night  Wide mouth jug  Thank goodness  You were born a boy  Just make sure that  Nobody wants any lemonade  In the morning  I misread it  Wide mouth jig  Jesus  There's a good line here  By the way  About bullies  Yeah  It says  When I was a kid  Everyone was always trying to convince me  That bullies were actually cowards 
[02:21:30]  If you just stood up to the bullies  They would chicken out  And leave you alone  And then he says  What a bunch of baloney  Baloney  Pooping  There we are  Pooping  Taking a good dump  In the wilderness  Requires you to  Hunker down  This means that  Since you don't have  A toilet to sit on  You're just  Going to have to pretend  Now you're hunkering  After you're done  Most good campers  Do a thing called 
[02:22:00]  Cat sanitation  That means they  Bury their poop  Like a cat does  Ah  Uh oh  And to do this  Anthony  You need a small shovel  Dig a hole  At least six to eight inches deep  Hunker down  And poop into it  Toilet paper  Hunker down  If you have ever had to wipe  Using bark or leaves  You'll know it is not very pleasant  It's even worse  If you accidentally  Grab some poison oak  Be sure to clean up well  You don't want to leave  Any dew on the lily  If you know what I mean  This could lead to  Bacon strips in your underwear  Instead of in the frying pan 
[02:22:30]  Where they belong  As for the toilet paper  Be friendly to the environment  Either burn it  Or bring a zipper lock baggie  And pack it out with you  If you will be camping  In the same spot  For a while  Just sprinkle some dirt  Over your poop  So that others  Can use the spot  When you are done  With your poop hole  Cover it up completely  And run away  Wait Opie  There's a section in here  Oh oh gee  Oh my god  He's gonna  No  What  What's the window  Oh  Oh  Now Opie  You may have thrown that too soon 
[02:23:00]  You missed the section marked  Jokes  Exclamation point  Under the caption  School and studies  Father  From this report card son  It looks like you studied  Underwater  Timmy  What do you mean dad  Father  Well all of your grades  Are below sea level  And then Timmy says  Good one dad  Hello  Hello  How about this  To a friend  Who's short  Got some things 
[02:23:30]  For short people here  How's the weather down there  I've heard of half pints  But you must be a quarter pint  I  There's another good one  For people that are short  By the way  How is the gig Voss  Do you know why  You aren't allowed on ships  Because you have to ride  In a shrimp boat  I  I don't trust short people  Their brains are too near their butt  Alright Anthony 
[02:24:00]  We found out who  Brought this to the show  How many more copies  Do we have to destroy  That's it  You've got all four of them  Steve  Who gave you this  Guy in Oregon  Wow  Guy in Oregon  Sent this in  Huh  Bart King  Bart King here 
[02:24:30]  He's just  Ripping the whole boat  Just keep ripping  As I do  One page at a time  Anthony says  Dear Steve  Here are some copies  Of the big book of boy stuff  If you're interested  In specific  Things for the show  Here's  Here's  Here's some I think  That would work  Oh he wrote down  A little list  Of things that'll work  So he likes his  Insults chapter  Which is page 153  In your workbook  Anthony  Hold on  Do you still have  Page 153  You bet I do  Insults  Exclamation point  Alright  It starts off by  153 
[02:25:00]  Wait hold on  I'm on page 140  Let's get to 153 quickly  There we are  Alright it says  Part of being a boy  Is enjoying a good insult  I say enjoying  Because boys know  That when done properly  One of the best parts  Of friendship  Friendship can be  Insulting or dissing  Your buddies  It's an excellent day  When you can hang out  With your buds  And getting some  Good zingers  Which is true  You little scumbag  I got your name  I got your ass  I gotta get up to that page  Hold on  That's 51  152  You are right  Here we are  152  Alright hey  If you can't laugh  At yourself 
[02:25:30]  Make fun  Of your friends  Just remember  That's a good example  Just remember that  You should only enjoy  Insults with friends  And relatives  Who are in a good mood  Like practical jokes  They are not to be used  On strangers  Or people you do not  Get along with  They obviously have not  Hung out with  Club Soda Kenny  Jim Norton  Rich Voss  And the rest of the crew  What side was that  Private file  Sir left side sir  Are you sure  Private file  Sir yes sir  So then the guy has  What  Then you hit him  In the side of the head  Then the guy has  Examples of good insults 
[02:26:00]  That you can use  Wait wait what page  O.B.  154  Oh here I am  You want to read  The insults  Let's practice  This one's really good  I read the short one  That's what I was reading  Alright  To friends who are short  This one's really good  Alright go ahead  To a friend you want  To call ugly  Beginner  You're ugly  Intermediate  You're so ugly  When you were born  They put tinted windows  On your hospital room  Oh  Advanced  Can I borrow your face  For a few days  While my butt  Is on vacation  Wait wait 
[02:26:30]  You gotta read the others  To a chubby friend  Beginner  You are chubby  Intermediate  You are a wonderful  All around person  It just takes a while  To walk all around you  And then the advanced person  That's really good at insults  Anthony  Yeah  You remind me of a map  A globe to be exact  Oh that's funny  To a friend who just got a haircut  Beginner line  Your haircut stinks  Intermediate line  I mean that's the advanced line 
[02:27:00]  That's what you  That's not beginner  Intermediate line  Did a lawnmower attack you  And then the advanced line  Hey nice haircut  Was it half price day  At the barber shop  Wow  I like in the opposite page  There's special feature  Ready made insults  Okay  You take one word  From column one  And one word  From column two  And then one word  From column three  And you call people that  Alright  Like I'll try  You  You silly  Rotten

[02:28:00]  To a friend  You want to call stupid  The beginner line  Would be  You are stupid  Intermediate line  Want to see something stupid  Look in a mirror  The advanced line  Brains aren't everything  In your case  They're nothing  And if you're a genius  At insults  I don't think you're stupid  Stupid  But what is  But what is my opinion  Worth against the thousands  Of people who disagree  With me  It sucks  Well where's that other card  I want to see  What else he thought  Was really good in his book  This guy sure is good  Yeah 
[02:28:30]  Making sounds  The cover's nice though  Oh look at this  You can turn it inside out  The cover  It's it's on the front  It's a pretty funny  Wacky picture  But when you turn it inside out  It's like a composition notebook  Like those black and white  Speckled covers  Oh so you can have that  And it would look like  A regular book  But your teacher  Would probably wonder  Why are you reading that  And laughing  See and then  If you take the cover off  The cover says  Physics  So you just have  A physics book  Your book stinks mister 
[02:29:00]  I say we pile them  In a big pile  And burn them  Yeah  Your book stinks  Yeah I agree  Some books should be burned  How does that think about it  That's the beginner insult  Your book stinks  The intermediate insult is  Hey Steve  If you ever bring this  Horseshit to the show again

I guess I would call it  A combination of 
[02:31:30]  Mad Magazine  And Boy Scout Manual  That's what I was looking for  With it anyway  That hits it right on the head  I think  If you want to ask it  So uh  Kind of have  Have a humorous feature chapter  Maybe a uh  Chapter on um  Yeah explain the book a little better  Because uh  We just got it  And uh  We went through a little bit of it  But um  We haven't really got the gist  For our listeners  You know  Yeah I don't know  We talked about the insults  And we thought the insults  Uh  Chapter was absolutely um 
[02:32:00]  Yeah that was pretty good  Absolutely brilliant  Well I guess uh  If I had uh  One role model  That I was looking towards  When I read it  It was uh  Joseph Pujol  And if you look on page 130  You'll see his mini biography  130  Wait wait 128  Hopefully this book still has  139  Uh  He was uh  His nickname was  The Fartomaniac  Oh yeah yeah  Oh yeah okay  The what  The what  The what  The Fartomaniac  Yeah  Joseph uh  Pujol  Right  There you go  He was kind of a  Moulin Rougeer  Uh performer in Paris  And uh

[02:42:30]  The Ophie and Anthony Show  Ophie  Yes, Anthony  Pat from New Jersey  Asking me if my oral experience with Buzz 
[02:43:00]  Was like Sigourney Weaver in Alien  Coming face to face with that second set of drooling teeth  That was pretty much the image I had in my head  And that's why I was quite fearful  Her name wasn't Buzz because she was shaving  No  No  And Andy from England  This show is all over the world  I don't know what is going on  But a lot of people are listening to this show for free, Anthony  Andy  Andy's checking in from London, England  Maybe we were growing up as cavemen in another era  What the F does that mean, Ophie? 
[02:43:30]  Ease off the NyQuil and learn to speak  Syndication in England, Andy  You know what I was talking about?  He's got to analyze every word  We're thinking on the fly here  People know I have a problem with my language lately  I don't know why  I think it's because we're getting up at 3 in the morning  Sorry, Andy  Are we bastardizing the Queen's English over there, are we?  Are we?  Yes  You're critiquing me?  Listen to some of the listeners when I call in  I'm very articulate compared to them  Yeah  When I'm feeling bad about my language  I go to a call from Georgia 
[02:44:00]  Oh, boy  Yeah, go to one of those chocolate calls, man  Oof  You want to critique me?  My God  Get someone from Alabama  You're a regular Olivier  I look like an English professor  I don't know what it is  My brain's a little fried  All right, let's get to this email from Melanie  Melanie, very concerned, Anthony  Very concerned  Very, very concerned  She loves the show, she writes  Too much sex?  No  Oh, okay  She listens every day 
[02:44:30]  Just one quick question regarding Ozzy on the show  Heard him talking shit about Sharon  But on TV, they look like they're very happy  Like a very happy couple  Yeah  Did something happen between the two of them?  Did she go and cheat on him or something?  Just curious to know what's up to have caused him to say that stuff about her on your show  Ozzy's been calling our show for years, by the way  I wonder if it's the fact that she's, you know, doing other things  Not maybe spending enough time with him  Well, we're going to find out in a few minutes here  It is possible that I am the only one in the world that doesn't keep up with celebrities enough to know 
[02:45:00]  I apologize if this is a stupid question, but I'd really like to know what's up  Thanks so much for your time  Keep up the good work  Making me and the rest of America laugh  Thanks, Melanie  So she's very concerned about Ozzy  Well, there's only one person that can settle this  And if I knew how to get there  No, here we go  Okay  Ozzy!  Hey, guys  How are you, guys?  Very good  Sorry to wake you up at this hour, Ozzy  By the way, before we get down to the story 
[02:45:30]  I stumble over my words to OB  Don't worry about it, you know  See, he's helping you out there, Ozzy  Thank you  Another guy that makes me look like an English professor  I tried to bail you out there and you went all silent on me anyway  No, it was good, it was good  What?  It was good, Ozzy, it was good  Now, what's the deal with you and Sharon? 
[02:46:00]  Actually, Sharon, about a few months ago  She actually came out public and said that  While we were on tour, this is going back years ago  That she had a fling with Randy Rhodes  And it's absolutely true  But, I mean, I thought I'd be able to move on from it, you know  But I was fucking heartbroken, you know 
[02:46:30]  That's quite a few years ago, though, Ozzy  Yeah, Ozzy, you gotta get over that one  You know, it's been a while  But, you know, I have a lot of time to think about things  And, you know, it's been eating me up inside, you know  And now that you're getting older  You just can't get over the fact that she banged Randy?  Oh  Did she actually bang Randy?  Yeah, I'm telling you that God's honest truth 
[02:47:00]  You know, she had sex with Randy Rhodes  Oh  But you were having sex with some of the groupies out there on the road, right?  No, absolutely not  That's the point I wanted to make  On a nightly basis, I've had, you know, the opportunity to, you know, to fuck as many women as I want, you know  I never, I never did it, you know  Right  Wow  That is kind of a drag, but  So what's going on with you and Sharon? 
[02:47:30]  Oh, nothing's decided yet, but  There has been talk of, you know, separation  But I'm not, I'm not sure what's going on yet  Are you going to move out or what?  I don't know, you know  Uh-oh, was she just listening on the other line?  I heard somebody hang up  No, I just switched the phone  Oh, okay  Oh, you want to go talk somewhere that's a little quieter? 
[02:48:00]  A little bit, the other wing of the house, you know  I'm still at home, you know  So I don't want, you know  Yeah  I don't want to stir this shit anymore than it is, you know  Right, well, I mean, the TV show is dying, or is it dead? I don't even know  Are they still running the Ozzy show on MTV? I don't even know  I think at this point, you know, it's reruns  I was totally against, you know, the second season to begin with  But she forced you to do it, right?  Sure, you know 
[02:48:30]  Because it's all about her, right, Ozzy?  I'm sorry, what was that?  It doesn't seem to be all about her  It seems to be all about her  It's all about my kids and her  You hardly see me, you know  Which is fine, you know  She's using your fame and popularity to make herself famous  Sure, she's actually been doing it for years  But I can't complain too much, you know  She made me a rich man, you know  But, I mean, I think there's a couple drawbacks to getting this divorce, you know 
[02:49:00]  First of all, my kids, you know  Yeah  But the other thing, and maybe somebody on this show could relate  I really don't want half my shit gone, you know  Yeah, it's going to be, you know, half your shit  And probably more considering she really had a lot to do with where you are  Or at least it looks that way  You know, you watch the show, you wouldn't have anything if it wasn't for Sharon 
[02:49:30]  That's pretty much the way she presents it  So Ozzy, are you giving us a world exclusive here  And telling us that you're going to divorce Sharon Osbourne?  Absolutely, man  I'm seriously considering it  And the only reason I'm talking to you guys  You know, I've been listening  You know, ever since two years ago  On an alleged, you know, hookup I had in LA  Before you guys were even syndicated 
[02:50:00]  So I figure I go right to, you know  The people who have been talking to me from the beginning, you know  You know she's going to kick your ass if you divorce her, right?  Sure, man  I'm, you know, I'm fucking heartbroken  Ozzy, you've got to get a lawyer first, though  Don't let her make the first move  Or you're really going to get screwed  Do you know any?  And you've got to be petrified  Because, you know, you can't take Sharon  She's going to beat the crap out of you  Oh, no, I'm  If it comes to us making statements in court 
[02:50:30]  I'm fucked, you know  Yeah  But I'm really, you know  Like I said, there's a couple reasons  I'm not moving forward at this time, you know  Alright, well, let's get to the meat of the issue here  Why are you getting a divorce from Sharon?  I just, first of all  It's been bothering me for years  Like I was saying before  I've been faithful, you know 
[02:51:00]  I've had ample opportunity to, you know  Go outside my marriage  But I've never done it, you know  Yeah, yeah  Is she screwing around on you?  Yeah, man  I just said that before  No, I know the Randy Rhoads  But I mean, anything recent?  Not that I know of  But, you know  I'm like a big kid, you know  I can't  Stuff like that really bothers me, you know 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, yeah  Oh, boy  You know, if you're unhappy  Leave the fucking marriage, you know  That's fine  But I'm definitely against, you know  Going outside marriage, I think  Ozzy, you're just not into her  When she gets naked anymore, huh?  I mean, she lost all that weight  There's got to be a lot of hanging skin  Jeez  Going back to what you guys were talking about earlier  About, what was the name, Anthony?  Buzz  Yeah 
[02:52:00]  I'm really, you had it good  Compared to what I'm going through  You should see, you know  A 50-year-old intimate area, you know  So, you're saying Sharon doesn't shave down there?  Not even that, you know  She doesn't, first of all  But what I was really saying is  You thought there were a lot of, you know  Crevices and whatever  Oh, God  You should see one that's had time to age  Jack's big head going through there 
[02:52:30]  Probably made some damage  I don't need to know about Sharon's poo-ha  You just want some young poo-ha, right?  Well, at this point  It's looking like a better alternative, you know  Is there anyone out there that you're interested in banging?  I have to tell you  Some of the friends that Kelly brings around the house, you know  I knew it  Some of them  I mean  I might as well  Of course stay over 18, you know 
[02:53:00]  Wink, wink  But I think  I think that  If I had another chance  I'd go for somebody a lot younger, you know  Yeah, of course  Alright, so  Alright, it looks like Ozzy's going to get divorced, Anthony  That's what it's looking like  That's what we're finding out today on our program  Well, we wish you the best, Oz  But, you know  Whatever makes you happy, Ozzy  When was the last time you had sex with Sharon?  Oh, it's been  Probably about a month, you know  Oh, that's not too bad  It's not too bad 
[02:53:30]  But, I mean  I can't, you know  There's new information for me, you know  You know  I only found out about it recently  So it's kind of  Affecting my sex drive  With her, at least, you know  So I figure  If I move on  I get my  You know  Because I don't have too much time left, you know  Wait, what's the new information?  Well  That she was having sex with Randy Rhodes  I only found out about it, you know 
[02:54:00]  Oh, okay  A few months ago  Oh  And that's the reason?  You're that pissed off about something that happened like 30 years ago?  Absolutely  Well  I hope it  What makes it  What says she's not, you know  Doing it as we speak  If she's doing it, you know  Well, I don't think she's doing Randy as you speak there, Ozzy  But she was unfaithful back then  Maybe she is now  Unless she's got a shovel  I would hope not  Right  I believe 
[02:54:30]  I'm just, you know  Like I said  I'm  Emotionally  I'm a big kid, you know  I don't think you're thinking straight  I mean, if this happened 30 years ago  I think you could get over that  You know, I guess some people deal with things different ways, you know  And it's possible that I might get over it  But I just don't know  I think this is a tip of the iceberg issue, Opie  I think, you know, it's probably been building for a while  And this is just something else that's gotten under Ozzy's skin 
[02:55:00]  I mean, another issue  I mean, let's be honest  I genuinely love my fans, you know  But I have to say  I've been wanting to get out of it and retire for years now  Right  So what are you going to do?  Like, just move to England and let her stay in the States?  I haven't decided yet  I haven't even decided if I'm leaving yet  But if I do leave  I'd like to stay in, you know, in the States 
[02:55:30]  But, you know, Long Island's a nice place  And California's a nice place  So I'm just not sure what I'm going to do yet, you know  Right  All right, Ozzy  Well, you know, keep us informed, okay?  I will do, guys  Like I said, you know  I love you guys' shows  So if anything else happens  I'll, you know, be happy to let you know  All right  All right, Ozzy  Thanks, man  Thank you, Ozzy 
[02:56:00]  All right, you guys take care of yourselves  All right  Bye  Paul from Boston  Hell hath no fury like an Ozzy scorned  Scorned  Wow  There you go  There's a world exclusive  Ozzy's getting a divorce, Anthony  A little dejected  Welcome to the OB and Anthony  Oh, for crying out loud  Yeah, heard you the first time  Can I help you?  Yeah, that's me  Yeah  What do you mean served?

[03:00:30]  Down with the pianos  I'm sure they'd love that  Yeah try to set that up  Set up John Valby  In front of one of those  Really nice Steinways  And see the horror  On everyone's faces  He performed last night  This show stinks  We can't get anything going  Why would we want  John Valby on the air  Without his  We can play his CDs  Yeah we can do that  They're playing him  When we go to breaks  We need him in here  With his keyboard  What's he going to do  Play a CD  And then go yeah that's me  Yeah  You know what he told me  He said he wants to sing  Acapella

Bush  Oh

[03:28:30]  Here's Opie and Anthony  When they're not awful  Okay, terrific  The worst of Opie and Anthony  No more of that, it's bad for you  Alright, Anthony, we got some audio of O.J. Simpson  Oh, the latest O.J.  And you got the story too, right?  Oh yeah  O.J., anytime you see that O.J. dot in any headline  You know it's going to be entertaining  O.J. has now given us over a decade of fun and joy and happiness in the news 
[03:29:00]  Anytime a story about O.J. pops up in the news  You just, I run to it  Right  I'm still fascinated by O.J.  Can I play the clip real fast?  Let's hear it  And then you have more in that article there  Two friends face in debtor hearings  If I have to work to pay them, I won't work  It's that simple  So I'll just play golf every day  Oh, this son of a bitch  You know  What is Fred Goldman waiting for? 
[03:29:30]  Just kill him  Kill him  What is he waiting for?  You have to take one for the team  You have to kill O.J.  You'll go to jail  Probably not for a long time, I don't think  They'll call him a racist  Oh, well, they'll probably pull that card out  You shot the black man who murdered his son  You know something  What is Fred Goldman waiting for at this point?  You have to kill O.J.  Now O.J. is basically saying  O.J. owes Fred Goldman and the family there how much? 
[03:30:00]  $33.5 million  And O.J. has decided he will not pay them a dime  He'd rather play golf all day  Because if he works  Here's O.J.'s situation  Here's what poor O.J.  The situation he's in  Lives down in Florida  He's got a $575,000 house in Florida  Which is pretty good in Florida  Sure  He collects $30,000 a month  From his NFL pension  A month  $30,000 every month  The pension by law 
[03:30:30]  Cannot be touched by the victim's families  So he's got this coming in  For some reason  Why is that?  Why can't you sue this guy?  He's making $30,000 a month  And they can't sap any money out of that  Because of some law  It's probably for old people  Or some people that are making  Obviously $1,500 a month  You can't tap into it  Yeah, but Jesus  In the future  His annuity will pay him as much as $125,000 a month  So I guess that goes up  If he works  If he does any work 
[03:31:00]  Any money he makes from working  A percentage of that  Will go to pay this $33.5 million  To the Goldman family  So he refuses to work  That's brilliant  It is  And he mocks Fred Goldman  In the process  And now  Remember when this first happened  And he was acquitted  He walked around  And he didn't say much about anything  Well, I'm going to find a real killer  And, you know  Play some golf  And get on with my life  And he really didn't talk about the family  Or anything 
[03:31:30]  Now  He's just going on shows  Ah, Fred Goldman  Hey, fuck him  If he can't take a dead son  Ha ha  What does he say about  Come on, kill me  Pussy  What does he say  About Fred Goldman  And how he didn't really like his son that much  Or didn't love his son  Yeah  As much as  Yeah, Simpson also took his cruelest pot shot to date  At Fred Goldman  Saying, quote  He didn't care about his son when he was alive  And accusing the dad of  Trying to  Make money off his son in the grave 
[03:32:00]  What is Fred Goldman waiting for?  And Fred Goldman's got to take this  The accusations rolled off Goldman  Who called Simpson a liar and a murderer  Ooh, revelations  You know how hard that's got to be though  When you're waiting for money  And it's contingent upon a black guy working  Oh my goodness  That's why half the people love you  And half the people hate you  Boy, that was a good line  Perfect example  A great line  It was  There was some  That guy  You know what I'm saying  That guy I called in doesn't hate me  Don't worry about it  I'm just messing with you  No, no, no  I'm saying he doesn't hate me 
[03:32:30]  Anthony, maybe this could be the latest game  Like that JFK thing  We were talking about yesterday  Oh, would that  See?  Everyone's up in arms about the JFK game  Which I was playing yesterday  Unbelievable  I cannot now make the money shot  That third shot  You guys laughed at me yesterday  Because you were taking the wrong shot  I was taking the best shot I had at Kennedy  You know, a lot of new listeners  Because they're turning on their radios every day  So it's the JFK game everyone's talking about  You download the game online  Yeah  A lot of people just outraged  You're in the window 
[03:33:00]  Sixth floor  Book depository building  And the motorcade comes around the corner  It's coming right at you  And then it turns  Kind of in front of you  Outside the window  And now you've got to take the shots  I've been taking the shots  At the front of Kennedy's face  I know  Anyone would have  Of course it's the best shot  That's why Oswald had help  Or didn't do it at all  Everyone's saying  So it now makes the turn  And now you've got to take the shot  Kind of through some leaves  From behind  Why would he wait to take the shot there? 
[03:33:30]  Maybe because he was late  All I could think of  Maybe he got up to the sixth floor a little late  All I could think of  Is if you're hanging out the window  With a rifle  Directly in front of them  Somebody in the car  One of the Secret Service guys  Might get a view of you  See that's why this game is great  Because now you're in the same spot Oswald was  And you're not following the logic  Of the Warren Commission  Let me tell you something  I now agree with the game maker  At first I was like  Kind of yeah  This guy's full of shit  It's just about getting this game out there  It's a little sensationalism  And it's gory 
[03:34:00]  It's morbid  It's  Well the guy's smart  I mean  But  He's making money  And he's also figured out a way  To make it kind of legit  His whole thing on it  Yeah  Is saying that it's like a research tool  It's some kind of research tool  That the common man  Can now put himself in this situation  And see  How difficult it would have been  To make that shot  And I gotta agree  It kinda is interesting  That it's so easy  To take that front shot at Kennedy  And then when they make that turn  And now  You're very high up  Your angle 
[03:34:30]  From the window  Down to the car  Is a very steep angle  And then from the back  With the leaves of the tree in the way  It's a very difficult shot  So now I've been shooting  The first shot  And missing  That's what they say  The first shot did  But you gotta miss  In the right spot  Yeah  You gotta hit the curb  I think  Under the overpass  Yep  Next to that  Next to that dude  Whatever his name was  James Tate  Oh sorry  The second shot  Has to go through Kennedy  And out  And then hit Connelly  Right  Which I've done 
[03:35:00]  That would be the magic bullet  Right  Yep  The magic bullet  I did that  And then the third shot  The money shot  I just cannot pull off  I wind up hitting Jackie  In the throat  I hit Connelly's wife  I cannot get that money shot  The old busting head shot  Very difficult  Does Anthony run out of the building  Where he could have  No  He stops  And has a coke  You keep getting distracted up there  Do you  Sucking David Ferry's cock  All painted in gold 
[03:35:30]  Wow  Oh what if we  Yeah  Cage  Cage from whackbag.com  He photoshopped you as Oswald  In a bunch of shots  Very funny  Hilarious  Go to whackbag.com  For some photoshop  That is a great one  I see a trend happening though  I see a trend  This game is kind of cool  And uh  Why not have an OJ game  You could actually have OJ  At the murder scene  Uh  Killing his ex-wife 
[03:36:00]  And Ron Goldman  That would be interesting  Your OJ  You know  Was it him  Or was it two people  That was selling drugs  To my ex-wife  Was it two people  It was Pedro Guerrero  Was it Pedro Guerrero  In the trunk  With the drugs  Pedro Guerrero  Was it one of the  Guys that was  Banging my ex-wife  And driving around  In my car  That I bought the bitch  Right  Or was it me  After you know  Use your mouse  To circle around the house  And watch my wife  Giving head  To someone on the 
[03:36:30]  On the couch  While I  Hit the outrage button  On my computer  This game is lovely  I love this game  You are OJ  Do you choose  Your Bruno Molly shoes  Like I did that night  To track blood  Up and down my pathway  Do you use your  Heisman trophy  To take care of business  You know  That's the beauty  Of this game  I could either  Cut their throats  Or go way off  The game plan  And beat them  Over the head  With my Heisman trophy  That is so much fun  Look what happens 
[03:37:00]  When I press  The B key  The B key  That's the bell  The limo driver  Keeps ringing  Ding dong  Ding dong  Ding dong  Oh  Ding dong  Hello OJ  OJ  Ding dong  OJ  I'm waiting out here  I'm in the limo  Here to pick you up  Ding dong  OJ  OJ  OJ's not  Picking up  Is he even  Hey  Oh there he goes  Oh OJ's running  Past my limo  Dressed all in black  He's running  Behind the house

[03:44:30]  Jerry what's up  I got a new game for you guys  Okay  It's a Ted Kennedy game  We might as well keep it all in the family  Yeah you know  Why not make the Chappaquiddick game  The Ted Kennedy driving game  1969 Oldsmobile  Try to get across the bridge  Oops  See how long it takes you to get out of the seatbelt  Get out of the car  Tries to pull an evil Knievel  Doesn't quite make it  What does he do  Do I click the mouse and save the broad  Or go home and take a nap 
[03:45:00]  I say sleep it off  Ich bin ein drunk  Wow  I stood there  By the shoreline  Until I saw the bubble stop  Oh jeez  You gotta wonder  You gotta wonder what he did  That would be great  Like GTA  You're driving around  Big Ted head in there  In the back of the car 
[03:45:30]  Oops  Here you come  Simulating being drunk  Yeah  Oh god  Yeah you can't like work the mouse  To have him walk  He's just staggering home  Right  Very hard to work the mouse  Stagger home  Didn't he swam  Across  I keep trying to hit the alibi key  But nothing's coming up  It's not working  He'll get off the hook  Just hit that K key  The Kennedy name  There it is  Out of trouble  Oh brother 
[03:46:00]  Let's say hi to Eric in Jersey  Hey Eric  Hey what's going on man  We're hanging  Last day before a little vacation  Try to catch my game  Where you try to walk your way  Through the kitchen  Oh  Dang  Circumnavigate your way  Through pots and pans  Till you hear the crack  Of a gunshot  Or try my game  Where you play football  Skiing down a mountainside  Or how about mine 
[03:46:30]  Where you fly with a busted leg  Can you land a plane  In Martha's Vineyard  As your new wife  Babbles behind you  She spilt my coffee  Or play my game  Where you beat a broad  About the head  With a golf club  After jacking it  In a tree  Where in the world 
[03:47:00]  Is Martha Moxley  Boy the Kennedys  Could have a bunch of games  What are they outraged  About the first one  I can think of five more  That would be a lot worse  Oh wow  Try my game  Where you give a lobotomy  To your retarded daughter 
[03:47:30]  That only works  That game only kicks in  It's level two  Level one of that game  Is when the hangar fails  In the back room  Of the Kennedy complex  God that was a good reference  Uncle Ted makes an appearance  In the other game too 
[03:48:00]  Where you have to rape a girl  On the front lawn  Of the compound  You're forgetting one  What did you just write?  There's another  Kennedy's son  That died  That would be Joe  Oh what happened to him?  He crashed during what?  World War II  World War II  English Channel  Oh 
[03:48:30]  See  I didn't know the detail  He was supposed to be  The president  He was  They were grooming him  To be the president  Oh  And then they had to go  With their second choice  JFK  Look how that turned out  You pulled out Michael though  That was a great one  Yeah Michael  Michael Kennedy Smith  Was a fantastic one  Michael Kennedy Smith  They love being like  Peripheral Kennedys  And dropping that name in there  Wouldn't you?  Greg Opie Kennedy Hughes  Why not?  I would use that  I want to be  Anthony Kennedy  Kumiya now  Just for the fuck of it 
[03:49:00]  So I can get away with stuff  Yeah I raped the bitch  But I'm Anthony Kennedy  Hughes  We're all related  We're all related somehow  If you believe in  Adam and Eve  Sure  Robert Kennedy Chambers  Poor boy can't shake  That awful girl's legacy  Let him get on with his life  I know  You choke a whore with a sweater  And all of a sudden  Bah bah bah bah bah  You can't get out of jail  And do drugs anymore  Oh yeah?  Yeah  They caught him for drugs  I know  They caught him for 
[03:49:30]  The preppy killer was busted  Isn't it awful to be an older guy now  And be the preppy killer  Yeah  It was cool when you were  The little preppy guy  But now he's like  The old guy killer  He's one of the best looking guys  On earth  He was like a nine and a half  When he went to jail  What a dope  All that ass you were getting  On the Upper West Side  He was nabbed in a traffic stop  And they found powder  In his car Anthony  He was up in Harlem  He was up in the Harlem area  They pulled him over  What?  No inspection sticker  And suspended license 
[03:50:00]  And then they found  All sorts of powder  In his car  You know  I still don't have  My inspection sticker  I picked up my car  I think in August  Or maybe July  And I still  I keep forgetting  Until I get stopped  At like the tunnel  And they  They point it out  Or write me a ticket  And this morning  I got yelled at  At the Midtown Tunnel  It's  It's 4.30 in the morning  I got yelled at  At the Midtown Tunnel  For going too fast  But you know what happened?  There was a van  In front of me  And he took one of the 
[03:50:30]  Easy Pass lanes  And I knew I had to get  Through there  In front of the van  Or I was going to be  Stuck behind him  Yeah  The whole time  Through the tunnel  Which is just ponderous  I like driving through  The tunnel  So it looks like  I like  I like the size of the tunnel  To look like that scene  In Battlestar Galactica  Where they launch  The fighter ship  Like I just like  Watching the walls  Whiz on by  And I wanted to get  In front of the van  So I go through  And I swear  The gate comes up  A second before  It hits my hood 
[03:51:00]  I love that  So I go screaming through  And  Hey hey  And I stop like an idiot  And it's one of the  Port Authority  Tunnel  The Tunnel Authority cops  You know what this  And then they got a quiz  You at 4.30 in the morning  You know what the speed limit is  Through the plaza  I go 15  Why do they have to ask that question?  He goes no  I go 10  No  Seven  Five  Seven and a half  I go five  He goes  Five miles an hour 
[03:51:30]  Those asses  Why do they ask that  When they pull you over  For speeding?  Oh  I go I don't know  The sign's behind me now  Right right right  I was doing just fine  Should have said  50 miles an hour  Yelled at me  Like it should be  Because you know  We got cameras here  And we can tell  How fast you're going  And we'll  Whatever  Yeah what  Whatever  Um Eric  I don't know  If it's going to  Make sense anymore  But you've been on hold  For about 10 minutes here  Oh  What's going on?  No I was just going to say  You guys should make  A Sex for Sam game  Where you have to  Sneak around New York  And have sex  In different places 
[03:52:00]  You get caught  Oh and they get  Thrown off the air  Oh that's a good one  Yeah that'll make us  Very happy  Yeah  Yeah I play that one  Well thank you Eric  It will lead to  The latest newscast  We're on  What happened  Which one are we going  Say the line  Sick puppy  Oh yeah  Sick puppy  What's up  Hey how you guys  Doing today  Hey good  I gotta tell you  First off  You guys are the only reason  Why you even got  XM radio  Oh there you go  Thank you  Well do us a favor

[03:53:00]  I  I had to watch her  Think to the bottom  Again I like Kennedy  Just waited for the bubbles to stop  And I waved a pepper shaker over her  And went  It said she was  Dead  I can't believe it  I called 9-1-1  Hypothermia was setting in  Time was of the essence 
[03:53:30]  Sorry  Every friggin time  I know  Yes  Someone could die in a fire  On rescue 9-1-1  Time was of the essence  Hypothermia was setting in  They  Called 9-1-1  He said  To the host of rescue 9-1-1  And his wife drowns  Right there in the pool  He didn't know what to do  That burdensome wife  No he knew what to do  Oh he knew what to do  He knew what to do  One 1,000  Two  One thousand  Honey 
[03:54:00]  I'll call  After the count of three  One  One thousand  Two  I remember when I  Married you  You were a  Beautiful woman  Now you lay there  At the bottom of a pool  Lifeless like Spock  Behind the glass  When  Gone  Set off the  Genesis divide  Gone  Perhaps I should grab 
[03:54:30]  My communicator  And call Bones  Yeah Bones  Beam down to my pool  My wife seems to be drowning  Enterprise  Hello  Bones  Scotty  I love how it's the future  And he would turn dials  On his communicator  And actually tap it  Yeah  Come on  Bones  Pick up  Hi you reach Bones  No one's home right now  Leave a message

[03:55:30]  Drown in the pool  She was a  Money sucking monster  I'd get my  Bills at the end of the month  And review them  And the  Orified look on my face  Was much like  The look  When I looked out the window  And saw the monster on the wing  There's a man on the wing  There's $5,000 dead on my Amex  Same face  The bubbles seem to be stopping  Alright Bones  Well if you get this 
[03:56:00]  Give me a call back  Hi Spock  Your home pickup  I'm starting to think  Everyone's annoying me  Spock  Hello  Spock  Maybe it's Amok time  Every seven years  Spock gets horny  Gotta go back to Vulcan  Is that what it is  I know the pain  It must be  For a being like you  So logical  To be thrown into  Chaos like this  That's how I felt  Every time my Amex bill came in  Bitch could spend 
[03:56:30]  Spend  Spend  Spend  Spend  Oh  The bubbles did stop  And now she's got that  Glazed over look in her eye  Looking up at me  From the bottom of the pool  Alright Spock  You get in  Give me a call  Oh it was a video game  Just sitting back  And watching you guys  Rocks  God is that funny  Alright we can continue here 
[03:57:00]  There's a million of them  Coming in now  Rob from Long Island  What's up Rob  Hey what's up guys  Hey  How about the  Sonny Bono game  You know  Skiing down the slope  Trying to like  Dodge all those trees  Ah the same one  Trying to avoid the trees  Imagine that two people  Go the same way  Two like famous  Yeah  People go the same way  Hitting a tree  That's why I never liked  Watching Opie ski  Cause me skiing  We went skiing once  And I'm too new  At it  And I'm really bad  So I  You know 
[03:57:30]  Pizza pie wedge  Down the mound  I don't know what I'm doing  When I ski  Opie's just reckless  You and our old pal  Jay though  Scared the crap out of  Everybody else  That went that weekend  It's cause we were  Skiing down a mountain  Very slowly  You decided to go  To the top of the mountain  Just as the ski lifts  Were closing  And it took you  Well over an hour  To get down  It was dark  We walked down a mountain  On skis  It was dark  Yeah  And we're going to  The first aid area  And everything  Trying to find you guys  We were all hammered  Oh you guys were  Drinking all day  Smoking  We're up on the mountain  Yeah one more cigarette 
[03:58:00]  We'll go down  Awful  And then Opie's  Just reckless  Like he comes  You think  He's the guy  That like  As you're just  Struggling to stand up  He comes  Hey guys  See you at the bottom  Thank you  Mother  Son of a  That's how I  Inline skate in the park  He's looking behind  In and out of cars  And everything  He looks behind him  Make sure you're okay  But I always worry 
[03:58:30]  That you're going to  Hit a tree  No I don't do that  Tree skiing  No  No that's what  Sonny Bono was doing  Skiing  Are you using the trees  Yeah  A lot of the  A lot of the kids  Love tree skiing  It's nuts  You really have to  Know what you're doing  You see them skiing  Down those rocks sometimes  They go right over  The big boulders  That's a piece of cake  Compared to when  They go in the woods  Because you know  These trees come  At you fast obviously  Yeah  And if you're not  Turning really really quick  You're going to bite it  Actually I don't think  The trees are coming at you  Well 
[03:59:00]  I could be wrong  Yeah but technically  It feels that way  When you're on skis  And that would be  Really dangerous  Because when you're on skis  You feel like you're  Actually not moving  And everything else  Is coming at you  Coming at you  I think a dolphin  Could ski  I think he could maybe  I think he could snowboard  Before he could ski  Yeah strap the fins in  A lot easier  Than putting two skis  On one fin  But maybe Sonny Bono  Was just like skiing  A little you know  Near the edge of the trail  And then like you know  Hit a rock or something  Right because the trees 
[03:59:30]  Are right on the edge  Of the trail  I see the people do that too  That's nuts  But he was supposed  To be a pretty good skier  Yeah  Yeah  That's it for the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Golly gosh  Catch Opie and Anthony  Live Monday through Friday  6 to 10 a.m. Eastern  3 a.m. to 6 a.m. Pacific  With replays throughout the day  Want more?
