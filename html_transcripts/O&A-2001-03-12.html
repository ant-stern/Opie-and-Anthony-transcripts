<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts joking about pornography before transitioning to listener feedback on a previous segment featuring Ben E.  This led to calls, including one from Kevin criticizing Ben's music choices.  A birthday message for "Psycho Mark" was interspersed with the unexpected arrival of *Big Brother* contestants Brittany and Eddie outside the studio.

Brittany and Eddie joined the show, their arrival prompting banter about Brittany's unusual outfit (a skirt over corduroy pants).  The conversation quickly shifted to *Big Brother* gossip, specifically George's reported separation and move to Los Angeles.  Pressed for details, Brittany revealed she was no longer a virgin.  This sparked a game where listeners guessed Brittany's last masturbation tool via yes/no questions, resulting in increasingly explicit suggestions (vacuum cleaner tube, plunger, toothbrush) before a listener correctly guessed hair dye.  Brittany's explanation led to further sexually charged discussion.  The segment ended with more *Big Brother* gossip, including a website dedicated to Eddie, and general banter with callers, promoting a *Big Brother* cast reunion that evening.

The show then delved into a chaotic mix of calls and in-studio conversations centered on the alleged virginity of "Earl," featuring graphic descriptions of sexual acts and sexually explicit jokes.  Brittany and Eddie, still in studio, promoted an upcoming appearance at a Jewish synagogue, further fueling sexually suggestive conversation and anecdotes about their experiences, including a Las Vegas trip involving strip clubs and a bet involving a kiss.

A substantial portion focused on the veracity of an intern's claim of a motorcycle accident resulting in head and eye injuries.  The visibly bandaged and patched intern detailed the incident, met with skepticism from the hosts and callers who pointed out inconsistencies.  Eventually, the intern removed his bandage, revealing no significant injuries beyond slightly bloodshot eyes, confirming the hosts' suspicions.  This was followed by commentary on the fabricated story. A call from a 13-year-old "Drudge Jr.," claiming insider radio industry information, discussed a potential Opie and Anthony move to Los Angeles.

A further segment extensively detailed the same intern, Brian, and his fabricated motorcycle accident.  The hosts' suspicions grew, culminating in Brian removing his bandage and eye patch to reveal no injuries.  Brian admitted to embellishing the story to get time off.  This led to an on-air vote – initially tied – on whether he should be sent home, ultimately decided by listeners who chose to let him stay, though under strict supervision.  The segment concluded with discussion of Brian's behavior and motivations, utilizing significant profanity and sarcasm.

The show’s final segment covered the fallout from Brian's firing.  A listener pleaded for his reinstatement, highlighting Brian's delicate nature and show fandom.  Opie and Anthony ultimately upheld the firing, acknowledging Brian’s memorable final segment.  Meanwhile, "Matt Drudge Jr." again reported (incorrectly) that Opie and Anthony were moving to L.A. for an internet radio venture, resulting in a heated exchange. Other topics included a listener requesting Opie fire his babysitter; criticism of the station's poor promotional efforts (the promotional guy’s week off and Earl needing a cab due to a van battery leak); an upcoming, entrant-less "Best Ass Contest" with a Vegas trip as a prize; listener calls with crude humor and sexual innuendo; and a discussion of Steve-O's Jackass antics, specifically full-body waxing.

[00:00:00]  Halt, naked girls! Halt, naked girls!  Turn it off! Turn it off!  Oh, porno! Oh, porno!  It's not good for you  It's not good for you  Who else gives you porno and comedy at the same time?  A stupid program called the Opie and Anthony Shelf  1027 WNEW  Mince, Hay, Hay 
[00:00:30]  Oh, Big Jake Black.  How are you?  Good morning.  Now we're having fun.  You son of a bitch.  It's the O-Day Show. 
[00:01:00]  Hello.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  A lot of people not digging the Ben E.W. show today.  I know.  It's Scott's own X with the Beatles block.  That's from Rick and another guy saying zzzz like he's asleep.  Ben, what a dreadful way to start the week.  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  I couldn't believe it.  I'm still here in my ambulance working, and I felt like I needed to have a joiner to start  hitting the North cabinet behind me at the beginning of the Allman Brothers. 
[00:01:30]  Midnight Rider rocks, man.  Allman Brothers coming to town.  Yeah, I believe that, too, man.  But, hey, that cool tune in the beginning when I'm looking for something to perk me up halfway  through the day just wasn't there.  It hurt me.  That's the first time Ben decided to get a little mellow.  The first time?  He's telling him a little.  He's supposed to, like, set the mood for the show with two rockin' tunes.  I don't know.  Was he hitting the H today or what?  Were you hitting the H, Ben?  No.  It was a friend of ours birthday today, and it's stoned at work, so I sent him some stoner.  That was a dedication. 
[00:02:00]  A long-distance stone dedication to Psycho Mark.  Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.  Happy birthday.  Psycho Mark, you effing tool.  Well, we'll bring Mark whatever he needs to get him perked up again.  Just give us a call.  All right, Kevin.  Thanks, bro.  Thank you.  Bye.  A lot of people thinking Stinky was back.  Hey, did you see who was outside the studio?  Eddie from Big Brother and our old friend Brittany. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, yeah?  Brittany's back?  Brittany's back.  Cool.  We had a blast last time.  They're doing some type of what?  They're doing some kind of seminar or something.  Get them in here.  I think they've got to leave right away, so.  Oh, no, they're just stopping in for quick little highs.  Brittany!  Brittany, how you doing?  Eddie!  Eddie, what's up?  What's up?  Wow, look at how funky you are.  She got all fancy.  It was a little summer shirt tonight. 
[00:03:00]  She's going to be in front of some people, so she's got her Brittany wear on.  Yeah.  The Brittany look.  Got all my gear.  What is that?  Let's see.  You're wearing a skirt with pants.  Because they're corduroys.  Anything's a big one.  No wonder you're still a virgin.  Who could get into those albums?  What's that deal, though?  I haven't seen that one yet.  It's like, should I wear the skirt?  Should I wear the pants?  F it.  I'll wear them both.  Yeah, wait.  Get on a chair.  I've got to see what you wear.  Get on a chair.  Get on a chair.  Get on a chair.  Please, stand up.  Don't hurt yourself.  Yeah, what is she wearing at? 
[00:03:30]  Look.  You know, I look at her.  I said, I couldn't wear it.  I couldn't go to the bathroom.  I'd pee on myself.  Look at that.  Look at the ladies.  He's got a skirt and corduroys.  And those big, big shoes.  Why did you decide to go with that outfit?  The corduroys skirt thing.  Is that what they're wearing in California these days?  No, because it's so warm.  I got some fingers out here in New York.  I don't know.  Plus, I actually think it's cute.  Oh, there you go.  You're all you, because I like my outfit.  Talking to the mic.  Oh. 
[00:04:00]  You're all you, because I like my outfit.  So, we're assuming you're still a virgin since the last time we saw you?  No, as a matter of fact, I'm not.  Get out of here.  She's lying.  She's lying.  I'm lying.  Yes, I'm still a virgin.  Like you would tell us, you know.  If you wasn't a virgin, those corduroys wouldn't be on.  Just go with the skirt.  What are you guys doing in town?  Brittany?  We're doing the seminar center.  There's six of us from the show that are getting together.  That would be the Big Brother show. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, the Big Brother show.  Actually, it was funny, because Eddie and I were talking about it this morning.  It was probably going to start out where fans ask us questions.  Probably by the end, we're just all going to be fighting with each other over the front.  Now, who's going to be there?  I can only hope.  Well, Will's going to be there.  Will.  Yes.  And I haven't seen him since the last show.  Yeah.  That's the brother.  The brother from the show.  Yes.  And George.  That Eddie wanted to beat up.  Yeah.  George is going to be there.  I'm hearing things about George.  Is George's wife going to be around?  No.  The one that set up a bunch of people to get thrown out?  I saw George at this after Christmas Christmas party at the end of January. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  A little bit crazy.  A little.  Oh, my God.  Didn't he dump his wife?  That's when I heard that happen.  That's what I heard.  That's what we're hearing today.  Ask him.  Get all the inside scoop when you go here.  You guys are our reconnaissance.  What's going on?  He's going to tell us.  Oh, he'll tell you.  He'll let you friggin' dye his hair blue or whatever the hell it was.  He'll tell you.  Anthony, I think he liked you.  I heard George left his wife.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  He moved out to L.A.  Okay, I'll tell you.  I'll tell you what I know.  These two would get in trouble if they said it.  But I've heard the same thing as I'm sure you guys have heard. 
[00:05:30]  Brittany knows something.  George blew off his wife and went to Cali.  Yeah, he moved to California.  And when I saw him, he was trying to stay out there for a couple of years.  And his wife and kids were staying back in Rockford.  Oh, that's a healthy man.  It's a hell of a community.  But apparently he was staying in a hotel.  Now, this I didn't hear directly from George.  I heard later that he had stayed in a hotel for two months.  Yeah, two months.  And ran out of money.  Go figure.  He was staying in a hotel.  And then he moved back home.  So we don't really know. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  That's good.  I'm going to be leaving the house or moving to L.A.  Because I'm going to be discovered out there.  We're all going to have sex with other people.  But we're still happily married.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  Give us some more gossip from the Big Brother show.  What else have you picked up?  Brittany, what did you think of Josh's appearance on Blind Date the other day?  We talked about that on this show.  I actually missed it.  He looked like a tool.  He was trying to sell it to the chick.  And I would tell it to his face if he was here.  He was working it like, yeah, I was on this really popular show, Big Brother. 
[00:06:30]  And the date, she never even heard of it.  He was like, what?  What show is that?  Oh, oh.  Right.  You're wearing some sparkly stuff on your face there.  I see that.  Yes, I am.  It's sort of a glitter thing.  It's like my Brittany glitter.  Yeah.  We've talked about the glitter on the show.  The dangerous glitter.  Tagging guys with that.  I hope no one goes home with that on.  You guys glow in the dark.  When I'm at the nightclub, it glows.  It's really cool.  I think it's so cool.  Now I go out and I'm out. 
[00:07:00]  Glow in the dark.  Do you have it on now?  No.  We'll turn the lights off and see what happens.  Could I get some glitter on my zipper?  All right.  So there you go.  She'll come in with glitter on her eyes.  You come in with it on your belt.  So who else is going to be at the seminar?  Brittany, Eddie, Will, George.  Yeah, George.  Cassandra.  And Curtis.  And Curtis.  And Curtis.  My roommate.  In L.A.  Yes.  I'm telling all people that Curtis is my roommate.  I wasn't supposed to, but I let it out one day and now I just saw everybody.  Your roomies. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Nothing going on, though.  Please.  No.  Do you guys see each other naked, at least?  No.  It's funny, though, because it's weird because we live together in the Big Brother house,  but we kind of forget.  When I'm with Curtis, just the roommates now, we don't think about the show, really.  So it's kind of weird.  Like, I'll come out of the bathroom and I'll have, like, the towel wrap room and I'll,  like, run in my room and I'm like, what am I doing?  I was walking around on a TV show with this towel wrap, you know, wrap-up.  It's funny, but.  Oh, wait.  So you have a little towel on and sometimes it falls off and you go, ooh.  And then I'm like, ooh.  Can you dry my back since the towel's here? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the lotion comes out and it's crazy sometimes.  No, but, yeah, he's going to be here.  So what are you doing in L.A.?  Anything fun yet?  Yeah.  Life?  Yeah.  Porno?  I actually, okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  Have you approached, do any porno?  No, no, I haven't.  You want to be?  We got it.  We'll make one.  I just did this thing at AOL, though.  It's really cool.  Where I did a celebrity voice for their library.  Technically, I guess I'm considered a celebrity, which is pretty funny.  Technically.  On paper, that is. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, on paper.  But they, you know how they have, hello, welcome, you've got mail.  Yeah.  So I got to do my voice so people can, like, download it.  And so it's pretty funny.  They said that I can change it a little bit.  And so I was like, instead of you've got mail, I have, oh, aren't you popular?  With all your mail.  Like, that's my voice so you can download me.  Now we need that.  You can download me.  I've downloaded Hannibal Lecter on mine.  It's so funny.  It's like, you've got mail.  Good to eat.  No, we want yours.  We'll play it on the show.  Oh, yeah.  We'll play it on the show.  We're now going to have to download yours.  That should be up soon. 
[00:09:00]  That's fun.  Oh, it's not up soon.  They said they're editing it?  Yeah, they're editing it.  Oh, we'll never hear it.  Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Not much.  I hope I don't bring your wonderful program to a crashing halt.  Oh, like we're rocking right now.  Yeah.  I'm sort of mad because I don't have anything that's so interesting to say.  I just saw Eddie over at Comac Middle School today.  Oh, yeah?  And, yeah, he did a thing for us teachers this morning.  And I saw him talking to a girl named Colleen, who I think he went to high school with.  And I said, hello.  I doubt he remembers who I am. 
[00:09:30]  But I just wanted to say what's up and to thank him because I thought it was a great thing to do  to come in there and talk to us.  Oh, cool.  No problem, man.  Give it something back to the town you came from, the community.  Anthony, I'm going to go out on a limb.  It sounds like you don't belong in middle school.  No, I don't think so.  So why were you there?  I just drive around and look at the chicks.  Oh, you're a teacher.  Okay.  There you go.  Yeah, I teach English in that middle school.  All right.  Right on.  Cool.  Thanks, man.  Thanks a lot for giving me two minutes of fame.  And, Eddie, keep it up, man.  I think it's a great thing you're doing.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Okay. 
[00:10:00]  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  I know you're still a virgin or anything, but have we discussed, what do you do to take  care of the pressure?  I masturbate.  You do?  That's good.  I'm like, what do you think of it?  Right out there.  Right out there.  No, no.  Let's just sit on, simmer that.  Yeah, let me think for a while.  Let's just all ponder that.  That's always good material.  That's always good radio material.  There's some people out there, they won't even touch themselves.  Really?  They're lying.  Wow.  What's your technique?  Which hand?  Let's see it.  Slow than fast.  Which hand? 
[00:10:30]  Right or left-handed?  Even though I'm left-handed, I use my right hand.  Oh, yeah?  Wow.  See, I didn't even know that one.  So it feels like someone else touching me.  Yeah.  I do everything with my right hand.  I cut with scissors, everything, but left-handed, I'm right.  Not everything.  Anyway.  So right-handed, the same hand she shakes hands with.  Do you have a toy?  Any toys?  I have used things in the past, but I don't have a specific toy.  No?  Nothing in the night table next to the bed?  No, I don't.  How about this?  What was the last thing you used? 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, that's a good question.  That'll be a good question.  Now, wait.  Do we have to restrict the household items, or can it be like anything?  Anything.  Anything besides that right hand of yours.  I don't want to say it.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Because it's a household item.  It's a household item.  Can we make it a game?  Can we make it a game?  All right.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  It's a household item.  Okay.  Funny questions.  Funny questions.  You come up with the best games when you're on this show. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  All right.  Clear the phones.  Okay.  Don't say it.  Just clear the phones.  Definitely.  It's guess what household item Brittany uses to pleasure herself with.  Game.  And Brittany, if someone guesses, you have to fess out.  Okay.  All right.  It's going to take a lot of skill, I think, to really get there.  Can we get a hint?  A hint.  Tell Sticky to clear the phones.  Wait, wait.  Don't let her give the hint out.  Just in case it's too much of a hint.  All right.  Well, we'll just go.  We'll just ask questions and then let her.  Yeah, ask questions. 
[00:12:00]  All right.  Let's make sure everything's ready.  Okay.  Hey, we're set for a game.  Damn, I love the games.  Brittany, you're the best.  You're going to have to take a piano show more often.  All right.  Are we ready to play?  All right.  All right.  Why don't you set it up?  Okay.  Brittany is a virgin.  She pleasures herself occasionally, which is totally natural and pretty hot.  Uses her right hand, even though she's left-handed, Opie.  And occasionally, she's been known to use items. 
[00:12:30]  And one of these items, the last one she used, is a household item.  Something you just find around the house.  Is it common?  Well, it's not in everybody's house.  Okay.  I was going to say, is it a common item for everyone's house right there?  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  It's not a common item in everyone's house.  All right.  And up for grabs, we've got memberships to MafiaMob.com.  All right.  And a Sopranos prize package in.  Nice.  We'll whack you.  It'll be your choice what you get if you guess the item.  All right.  All these questions, people that you're asking, have to be yes or no answer questions. 
[00:13:00]  And once you get a no, we move on.  Well, they're allowed to ask a question and guess what the item is, right?  Not if they get a no.  Oh, okay.  If they ask a question and it's no, they are gone.  Do they play until they get a no?  Yes.  All right.  Zeke?  Is it a food?  No.  That's it.  You're out.  Bye-bye, Zeke.  All right.  Let's go to Kenny.  It's not a food, Opie.  Kenny, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, is it a, can you bake turkey with it?  No.  He's really getting, you know, he narrowed it down too much there.  He should have said something like, is it an appliance or something.  He's narrowed it right down to the turkey, baser.  No more clues.  No more clues.  No more clues.  This is a game.  All right.  Our listeners are very smart.  All right.  Marty, what's going on?  Yeah, hi.  Hey.  Well, the food kind of took away some guesses, so I'm going to have to go with, we'll go right  to the guests.  How about the tube end of a vacuum cleaner? 
[00:14:00]  What the hell is wrong with you?  Okay, she's a virgin, bro.  No.  Tube end of a vacuum?  What?  Okay, you are serious.  Once I was using the Flowbee in my lap.  All right, let's go to Larry.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, Larry.  Yeah.  Come on, what do you got?  Oh, I want to know if it's a plunger.  A plunger?  Oh, look, people.  You got a guess to narrow it down to help everyone out here. 
[00:14:30]  Don't just make guesses.  Anthony, I thought that was a good guess.  That was a dumb guess.  Dumb.  So far, it's not a food product.  It's not a turkey baser.  It's not a vacuum.  It's not a plunger.  Let's go to Sean.  At least a food product.  I narrowed it down for everyone.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, ONA?  Hey.  How are we doing?  All right.  Would the product be found in the bathroom?  Oh.  It may.  Probably.  That's probably the most likely place to find it.  Okay.  All right.  All right. 
[00:15:00]  Sean gets to continue.  All right.  Here's the deal, Sean.  If you ask another question, she says no, you won't be able to guess on the item.  So it's up to you.  All right.  You can either guess now, based on what you've learned, or try for another question.  If you miss it, though, you are done.  All right.  Well, I'm standing in my bathroom.  I'm looking at the toiletries.  I'm standing in the bathroom.  All right.  I'll go with another question.  Okay.  Is the item made out of plastic?  Yes.  All right.  Oh, this guy's dumbed this before.  I found maybe, yeah, usually in the bathroom. 
[00:15:30]  All right.  Let's see.  I'm going to take a guess.  I'm going to say the back of a brush.  No.  Oh.  That's right.  But he narrowed it down for a lot of people.  Yeah.  We're going to get this very soon.  That was going to be the best so far.  All right.  Chris, what's up?  That's a good idea, though.  Back of a brush.  Just taking notes.  Chris?  Yeah, I got a guess.  Okay.  I would like to, is it a toilet seat?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  A toilet seat?  No, not a toilet seat. 
[00:16:00]  No, not a toilet seat.  He said a toilet seat.  No, he said a toilet seat.  It's not.  No, I said toilet seat.  He said a toilet seat.  Did you say a toilet seat?  He said you sit on the toilet seat and go to town.  No, it's not a toilet seat.  Then he's trying to back them and go, and I said toilet tree.  Tree.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was going to guess, like, she's living with Curtis.  Is it chopsticks?  Would I get a sliver?  Yeah, that would be dangerous.  But for a virgin.  You know, not that small. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, man.  All right, Tom.  Thank you.  Later.  That's funny.  All right.  Dylan, Dylan, what's up?  Dylan.  What's up?  Okay, I was looking around in my bathroom, and I'm going to go right to the guest.  A bottle of shampoo.  A shampoo bottle.  Okay, those are enormous.  No.  A bottle of shampoo.  Yeah, one of those that you buy at, like, those quantity places there, those club shopping  places, the huge fat junk. 
[00:17:00]  Anthony, tell everyone what we're playing and what we're up to at this point.  Well, we are playing, guess what, the last item Brittany used to pleasure herself with.  She is a virgin, Opie, so she does pleasure herself.  And we found out she does use an item, commonly used around the house.  I only used it once.  Only used it once, but it was the last time she used anything.  How long ago was this, Brittany?  Two days ago.  Two days ago.  Getting hotter by the second.  Before I boarded the plane?  Before you boarded the plane? 
[00:17:30]  In your house or at the airport?  Not at my house.  What is it?  All right.  So she's rushing for the plane.  She figures she's got to get her M on.  And it's plastic, and it's something you would find in the bathroom.  Probably fine in the bathroom.  We love these Brittany games.  Oh, yeah.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Before I get, I want to ask a question.  Uh-oh.  Now that she's used something, is her virginal anatomy still intact? 
[00:18:00]  I think so.  Interesting.  The only, you know what?  That's a virginal question.  I don't know.  Wait, let Brittany explain.  Well, because I heard that sometimes when girls start using tampons, you can break it  and it seems like...  Yes, you do.  So...  There you go.  I don't know.  I mean, I think it is.  Because I...  Unless it went in a tampon.  I don't know.  It probably did with a tampon, yeah.  A lot of girls...  Well, it's been my medical record, so I think it must...  I don't know.  I feel too stupid to ask my doctor, Sue, do I still...  You know, it's too weird, but it says in my record... 
[00:18:30]  We could get a doctor up here.  Yeah, let's get a gyno in here and put you up in a stirrup.  All right, Rob, you've got another question.  Um...  I don't know.  Toothbrush?  No.  No.  No.  No, I'm very...  About my teeth.  Toothbrush?  And you just don't mix those things.  No.  What the heck could it be?  I got an idea.  Really?  Yeah, but I'm not...  Brian.  And remember, it's not found in everybody's house.  Right.  Not in everybody's house.  So it's not...  You know, a toothbrush isn't...  Hopefully, it's in everybody's house. 
[00:19:00]  It's in everyone's house.  You know.  Right.  Brian?  Yeah.  It's to you.  Okay.  I'm just going to go straight with the test.  Is it a curling iron?  No.  Is it a curling iron?  No.  There you go.  That's not a bad guess, though, because I thought about it.  I will never look at some of these items the same way again.  No.  I'm not on, of course.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, Jim.  Hello?  Oh, J.M.  Sorry, J.M.  J.M.  Yeah, can you...  Do you plug this in?  No. 
[00:19:30]  Oh.  It's not a plug-in item.  Good question.  I can't believe we haven't got it yet.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing?  Good.  Do you use it as a hair product?  Yes.  Oh.  Nice.  Narrowed down.  Beautiful.  You know what I'm saying?  You guys, Curtis is going to go home and be like,  you have a touch of this.  It's not even yours?  It's mine.  It's mine.  But I just thought about it.  He's going to go home and be like,  you know.  All right.  Right when you got home, 
[00:20:00]  I'd be laying in my bed with whatever it is on me.  He's going to come home then.  Just cranking myself like an animal.  Eddie.  It's a hair product.  All right.  A hair product.  Okay.  Do males and females both use it?  They can.  I would say more females do.  What the heck?  I'll get a little marginal bell.  You just squeaked through to ask another question or guess.  I'll guess.  How about a hairspray bottle?  A hairspray bottle. 
[00:20:30]  As big as a champagne shampoo bottle.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, maybe these guys are thinking of like little travel ones.  Because travel ones would be possible.  Eddie, do you know?  I think I know.  I'm kind of getting a guess here.  I'm kind of thinking.  I know.  Write down what you're thinking.  Do you know, Eddie?  I think you told me.  I have a couple of...  Yeah, I think you told me.  Because I remember I was debating it for a while.  I need a pen.  I think you told me.  I need a pen.  I know one, but you eliminated it already.  Yeah.  One of the items.  One of the...  It's a hair product. 
[00:21:00]  Okay.  All right.  Can you use it mostly by females?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Sorry.  What are you writing?  All right.  Is it a secret?  What is...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't say this.  Don't say it.  Don't say it.  That's not...  Oh, no.  Harry, what's up?  Oh, God.  Hey, John, don't hit me.  I'll give myself...  Harry.  Yo.  I just want to take a guess.  All right.  Is it a brush?  Okay.  They already guessed a brush. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Goodbye.  All right.  Double buzz for that.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mikey.  Hair care product.  Out.  In some people's homes.  In the bathroom.  It's a hair care product used mostly by females.  Mostly by females.  Rob, what's up?  What's up, man?  Hey.  Listen, I'm guessing it's a hair gel tube.  Hair gel tube.  No.  No.  Oh.  Guesses are getting better.  All right. 
[00:22:00]  Smart listener.  Mike, what's going on?  How you doing, O&A?  All right.  What's going on, Brittany?  Hey.  Okay.  Is it an item that could be found in most stores with a hair care product?  Not in most stores.  There's a certain type of store it's found.  Oh.  All right.  Now, you know something?  We got some info out of that, but I'm going to buzz you.  We have to move on.  All right.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's going on?  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  Is it a hair curl?  No.  See?  That was my guess. 
[00:22:30]  She looked at me like I had two hairs.  That's what a hair curl is.  I'm picturing those, like, hot curlers that you stick.  No, I'm thinking, like, the plastic one.  The one that got, like, holes in the side, maybe.  The one that Cassandra used to have in her hair.  Multiple sizes.  No.  No.  That's not long enough.  Is it in your hair?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, boys.  Hey, boys.  Hey, boys.  I didn't think you were, uh...  Hey.  Jeez.  That.  That's some more information.  Is it in your hair right now?  No.  Jimmy, what's up?  I was going to say a toothbrush holder, but since it's a hair care product, I'm guessing blow 
[00:23:00]  dryer.  Oh, God.  You know what?  She's probably going to kill me for telling you this, but...  Blow dryer.  What?  She's used a toothbrush holder.  You know the travel ones with the rig?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You closed up your toothbrush.  Yeah, yeah.  You've used one of those?  Wow.  That's what I was thinking she was going for.  How do you know that?  I know these things, man.  I live with this girl.  You use one of those?  In the house.  Right.  There's two things you find out outside the house.  Do you?  Yeah.  No.  But that isn't it.  That isn't it.  That's one of the best item at the shoes. 
[00:23:30]  But he did guess a blow dryer.  A blow dryer?  That's what he said.  No.  It's okay.  Blow dryer.  What?  I don't think you know the end of the blow dryer.  Okay.  No.  What kind of...  I'm playing buttons on that.  Turn it on and off.  Plus, they're huge.  Right.  Well, you know, after that curler remark, we're trying to find a happy ground here.  Right.  There's a port attached to the handle.  Yes, there is.  Yeah.  It's the snack you with.  And I said you couldn't plug it in.  Right.  Okay.  Scott, what's up? 
[00:24:00]  That was an electric razor.  Okay.  You can't plug it in.  Oh, I thought she said you can.  Sorry.  Something you can't plug in.  A razor?  Oh, my God.  Oh, no way.  We have some sick listeners.  What can I say?  Ezra.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  How about one of those hair clips?  No.  I have...  A loophole?  A loophole.  You can't keep guessing.  Oh, what's up?  All right.  Jackass.  Let's go to Rich.  Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's up, faggot?  Hey.  I say it's a thing of moose. 
[00:24:30]  No.  A thing of moose.  People, people, listen to me.  Now you think you have it and you're just guessing.  Try to narrow it down a little more.  Can I give a hint?  No.  Not yet?  Well, this is what we got.  It's found in the bathroom, but not everyone's bathroom.  It's plastic.  It's inserted.  No plug.  And it's a hair product.  Hair product.  I bet your ass it's inserted.  Well, she could have, you know...  And...  Tim.  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Could it be one of those shampoo nozzle sprayers in the... 
[00:25:00]  You do your hair with the tub?  No.  Uh-uh.  No.  We need people to ask questions.  Ask questions.  Narrow it down more.  Gary, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing?  All right.  Take a guess here.  No, I'm going blank.  All right.  Even if it's a...  Things like, is it consumable?  Is it...  You know what I mean?  Yeah, people aren't asking questions.  They've got no detectives out here.  They're taking stabs.  Hey, Juan, what's going on?  What's going on over there? 
[00:25:30]  We need someone that's smart.  Um, can I ask a question?  Yes, please.  Uh, does it fit in her hand?  One hand or both hands?  One hand.  Uh, well, that wasn't a yes or no question, but he did say first, does it fit in one hand?  So your answer is yes to that.  Okay.  All right.  Now you can continue.  Is it a tube of VO5?  No.  Which is a shampoo.  Oh, VO5.  I was like, what's...  I was thinking Vicks, like the big jar, and I was like, what the hell? 
[00:26:00]  John, what's going on?  Hey, guys, I got a question.  Okay.  Is it a container that holds the hair product?  Yes.  All right.  It's a container that holds the hair product.  That's good.  Okay.  So that makes it now it's not like a brush or something like that.  It's a container that holds the hair product.  Very good.  Very good question.  Okay.  My second question is, is the product something you apply to your hair?  Yes.  All right.  Something applied to the hair.  Very good.  So it's the container.  I'm going to go with a guest and say, is it hair coloring?  Yes. 
[00:26:30]  Oh.  It's hair coloring.  Oh, shit.  That should have been the first guest.  Oh, yeah.  That's a winner.  Not that title.  Mark, let me hear that again, the Marko clip.  That's a winner.  That's a winner.  It's funny, because I purchased it to dye my hair, and the agent said I couldn't color  my hair because it would make it, you know, harder for me to get a job or something.  So I'm like, what am I going to do with this bottle?  Ah, I don't know what you're doing.  I don't know.  Well, what's the shape of the bottle? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  Now we all need to know.  Now you're going to draw it.  It's, um...  Get a pen and paper.  Yeah, there you go.  Hurry up.  Here.  Here.  Here you go.  Throw a pen.  Throw a pen.  And some paper.  And, uh, give a little drawing.  What's the name of the product?  Yeah.  Draw an actual size.  What's the name of the product?  Actual size.  It's, um...  What is it called?  Fudge?  Good fudge packer.  It's so fudge.  Fudge packer.  Hi, it's bright colors.  Yeah.  I can't mention it now.  It looks a long match of hedges.  Okay, it's like...  I can't draw the actual size. 
[00:27:30]  John, very good job.  Hold on.  Are the ones matching the hedges?  It's like this.  Hold on, John.  We're going to give you a membership to MafiaMob.com or a Sopranos prize package.  Very cool.  Hold on.  You can hold it.  Tell Stinky what you want.  Congratulations.  You can hold it with the grip thing.  And then this is what screws off.  Oh, that screws off.  And then it squirts out there, but you hold the thing.  Are you talking about the product?  Are you...  Okay.  Hey.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  So that top screws on.  This...  Okay.  It's like a round up here.  Is it rounded or is it like a flat top? 
[00:28:00]  No, it's a round top.  That is made for pleasuring yourself with.  Dude, look.  It's got like ribs on the bottom.  And it's got little grip things that you hold it.  You hold it.  It's rounded on the bottom where the...  On the opposite end of the screw top.  Yeah.  So it's like a...  A test tube.  A standing test tube.  It's almost like a standing test tube.  And how wide is it?  That wide?  It's a little bit wider.  A little bit wider.  So you'd say maybe an inch and a half in diameter.  And how about how deep? 
[00:28:30]  Maybe.  What?  Eddie.  Sorry.  How...  How...  Yeah.  I'm at Grand Canyon.  Wow.  And what do you do?  Like you just...  You go into your room.  Is it a totally naked thing?  Or is it one of those, I got to catch the plane.  Let me just do it with my shirt on.  That was what it was last night.  Yeah?  Yeah.  If I'm going to be on a plane, I'm going to relax myself.  Normally, I go all out.  You do?  This time, I just did a quick...  Picture that one.  Picture that one.  I see it.  You're right. 
[00:29:00]  It's made for that.  You're naked on the bed with the tube of hair coloring.  That looks just like a...  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good thing it doesn't spring a leak.  And then your hair down there...  Well, when I said I used it once, I forgot.  I was nervous.  That's right before I went to the Grammys.  And I used it.  You used it before the Grammys, too?  Veteran bottle.  Wow.  So good.  The first time you're back for a second.  That bottle's getting a lot of action.  All right.  Hold on.  Imagine you're the bottle sitting in the store going,  Who's going to buy me?  Right.  Who's going to buy me?  Maybe, you know, some old woman or something or some kid wants to buy... 
[00:29:30]  Hey, look at that.  It's Britney.  Brother.  This is great.  Hey, what's she doing with me?  This is great.  Dave the Jew, what's up?  Good afternoon.  I was originally going to get the couch, but being that they already answered the question...  Let me ask you a question.  What's the ounces and the brand name of the product that you use?  It's called Fudge.  Yeah, it's Fudge.  Any amount of ounces, please?  Depends on the girl, man.  I need to know for the size tonight in bed, you know, the whole thing. 
[00:30:00]  No possibility to find that out?  We're going to have a lot of people laughing their bullies off when they go into the store  and see Fudge.  I know.  Thanks for taking my 12, guys.  Thank you.  These are the sizes of dimes, the middle size.  All right, hold on.  Pat's on the line here.  Pat, you're next on WADW.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Just saying, the stock and fudge just went through the roof.  Fudge.  Fudge.  That's classic.  All right, buddy.  You've got to hear about something.  Cool.  Are you on the website?  You don't have to leave them, too.  I'm trying to find my color. 
[00:30:30]  I'm trying to find the bottle.  What color were you using?  Orange Crush, Strawberry Fields, or Hot Chili?  I have Pink Flamingo.  I can't find that one.  And I have...  You got the bottle, though?  No, I'm looking for the bottle.  No?  2.5-ounce bottle.  Sink the pink.  It's not the 2.5.  I think it's the middle size.  Oh.  Because it's 2.5 at this time.  Yeah.  That's hot.  Paul, what's up?  Yeah, can we play...  What was the second-to-last thing, Brittany? 
[00:31:00]  I was playing this all day.  Yeah, because I got some good guesses.  She comes up with the best games for our show.  Yeah, definitely.  All right, Paul.  Thank you.  All right, thanks.  All right.  Well, a lot of people want to talk to you.  So where are you guys going to be?  We'll take a break, and we'll come back with Eddie and Brittany from Big Brother.  Yeah, we're speaking up at the...  We're doing a job for the Seminar Center tonight over on 112 East 75th Street on the Upper East  side.  It starts about 6.30.  It's the little Israel...  I want to say there's a temple up there.  It's 112 East 75th Street. 
[00:31:30]  Are they show up in a good five-day show?  Yeah, they get tickets there at the door.  I think it starts about 6.30.  6.30 is the actual gig.  It'll be Cassandra, Will, Curtis, Brittany, George, and myself.  We might have to go up after the show.  Yeah, you guys come down.  We should, yeah.  We'll put you on the VIP guest list.  Oh, look at you.  You guys have a special.  Look at that.  Yes.  All right, we'll be back with Eddie and Brittany next.  Stay there.  You people never cease to amaze me.  Obi and Anthony.  That's a cat.  It's a radio show.  Relax.  Wonderful.  Tomorrow we're at this. 
[00:32:00]  We can lock up a doobie and watch porn.  That's quality radio.  Damn great.  And we're hanging with Eddie, our buddy, our pal, and Brittany from Big Brother.  Hello.  A show we were really into.  And they're doing a seminar tonight on the Upper East Side.  I forgot where.  Yeah, it's up on 112, 112, 75th, between Park and Lexington.  It's something, Temple of Israel.  It's a little synagogue. 
[00:32:30]  I get tickets at the door between 6.30 and 9 tonight.  So, for all you Big Brother fans, Brittany's going to be there.  Eddie, Cassandra, George.  Will.  Will.  And Curtis.  And Curtis, right.  It should be a lot of fun.  You guys should be doing some fighting tonight.  It's going to be fun.  Trisha, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, Eddie?  Hey, what's up?  Long time no talk, huh?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm doing good.  I told you I was going to call and say hi, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Good, good.  I'm just hanging.  Do you want Eddie?  Huh? 
[00:33:00]  Do you want him?  That's a loaded question.  Maybe.  What would you want to do with him?  Oh, Brittany, come on now.  He's a fudge bottle.  Honey, you saw my face when I met him.  I was a little nervous.  Remember?  I met you, too.  You remember, don't you?  I met you.  Remember?  Trisha.  Oh, my God.  Don't rule.  Hello.  Hi.  How are you, sweetie?  All right.  Hi.  My God, you're creative, darling.  You know, I was thinking when I was listening to that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We've got to let everyone in on this. 
[00:33:30]  There was like a Big Brother reunion in Vegas.  Well, this is what happened when my mom was going to Vegas.  And so I was going to go meet her and my aunt and my cousin.  Aunt?  Yes, my aunt.  In Minnesota, they have aunties.  I have aunties.  Yeah.  And then Eddie was going to happen to be in L.A. that weekend.  So he was going to come with.  And then my friend Jen, who worked on Big Brother, was going to come with.  And then Curtis, and then it just like turned into this big thing, and Jamie came.  And we all, we had a big shindig in Vegas.  Yeah.  That was, woo!  It gets funny.  And Nellie, I was in a different car than Jamie.  And what? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, too bad.  And Trisha, you found out on the Internet they were going, so you decided to show up?  Well, no.  We've been, we have a website for Eddie.  He is Eddie's Angels.  We have a website for him.  Eddie's Angels?  What's Eddie's Angels?  EddieMcGeesAngels.com.  What is it?  It's a website for Eddie.  Are there hot chicks on there?  Oh, I don't know.  I can do a hot chick.  We can do a hot chick.  Ooh!  Ooh, honey.  My goodness.  That's it!  All right, hold on, Trisha.  Oh, wow.  I knew I'd find it. 
[00:34:30]  Hold on.  Ann, explain that to everybody.  Yes.  He just downloaded the bottle that I used.  Nice.  I'm actually saving this.  I will send it to the message board.  You gave him the bottle?  They will post it.  No, he found it on the Internet.  Well, that is totally custom made for a girl to do herself with.  Now, I need to know where this is because, you know, I was thinking, I was actually thinking  maybe it was those hot curlers that have really soft nubs all around them.  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, I never got it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I got to tell everyone because our audience changes fast here.  We were playing a game with Brittany. 
[00:35:00]  What bottle?  Fudge.  It's a hair dye.  Hair dye.  So, Anthony's been, like, combing the Internet for the last 20 minutes and he found the bottle.  And he found the bottle.  It's made for, uh, there it is.  It's made for good times.  Now, I will send it off to the message board so everyone can see it.  It's ribbed and everything.  Oh, Lordy.  Look at it ribbed at the bottom there.  Ribbed.  It is.  Ribbed.  For her pleasure. 
[00:35:30]  Dude, that is totally fit.  Like, they knew when they made this.  I didn't know they did.  This is what it would be used for.  Now, you get more bang for your buck.  Stink, what do you think?  You certainly do.  Look.  Stink, what do you think?  Stink, what do you think?  Hair coloring looks like it can be so in an adult child.  Doesn't it?  How about when you're done with it, you fill it up with hot water?  Wow.  All right.  And then it's warm.  Ladies?  Oh, my goodness. 
[00:36:00]  Comment?  You can fill it with, um, you can fill it, like, with, um, G.Y. jelly and stuff.  And, oh, my, never mind.  Yeah.  Hey, Trish, you got anything else?  Because you're boring me.  I'm sorry.  Well, God.  I'm not that boring.  You're boring me.  You're boring me.  I like making Eddie uncomfortable.  I don't think that makes Eddie uncomfortable.  Well, you have this website, Eddie McGee's Angels.  There's no hot chicks on it, so I don't get what that is about.  Well, how do you know that?  How do you know that?  Because I asked you, and you didn't give me a good answer. 
[00:36:30]  Well, Brittany did.  Yeah, that's hot chicks.  No, she said you're hot.  Well, you got to go look around.  And there are pictures of other girls that want to do Eddie on there or something?  Mm-hmm.  There's naked girls holding fudge bottles.  And, Brittany, by the way, I have, I am going today to get pictures of you and your mom to send to you.  Remember, I told you to do that.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  You're welcome.  All right.  Thanks, Trish.  I love you, Eddie.  Say goodbye, hon.  All right.  Talk to you soon.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Let's move on.  There's love there.  There's lots of love. 
[00:37:00]  Caroline, what's up?  Hi.  Or is it Carolyn?  It's Carolyn.  Care.  Yeah, I know.  Nobody cares.  Caroline.  It's Caroline.  It's Caroline, Brian.  My name is Brian.  Brian Regan.  He's great.  Okay.  Go ahead.  I have a question for Eddie.  Yeah.  I was wondering if he watched The Sopranos last night,  and what he thought of the one-legged nurse woman.  I was, yeah, I was actually doing my mail,  and my father grabbed me.  He said that girl's leg was stolen.  I think that's kind of cool.  I don't know if you guys caught The Sopranos last night.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:37:30]  So he comes running in the room.  Hey, there's a one-legged girl.  Yeah.  He's like, what the?  Dude, come here.  He's in his skivvies running around.  I don't know.  He's looking.  I don't know.  I'm doing that, yeah.  I'm from New York City running around in the underwear.  And he comes running in.  You see my father.  Your father is awesome.  I'm going to get him down here for the next lesbian for a day.  Hi, Mom.  It looks like he would enjoy that.  Oh, it's funny.  It looks like your mom would enjoy that, too.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  And he's got some wild parents.  But anyway, yeah.  So anyway, yeah, he comes running in,  and on The Sopranos last night, 
[00:38:00]  a woman had her legs stolen, her artificial limbs stolen.  She was hopping around all pissed off.  I think that's pretty cool.  I think that's great.  I'm wondering if she's really a one-legged lady.  Yeah.  You know, I feel kind of...  Well, I think it would be sort of hard to fake that.  Yeah, I think so.  Okay, listen.  Listen, they had a dead person on it last episode.  You know, computer graphics are crazy now.  Yeah, but that was a horrible fact.  The lady's been dead in the ground, and they had her on TV.  So you're saying that that's an actress with one leg?  That's what I'm saying.  Okay.  Hope so.  That'd be kind of cool.  I think you're right.  That's cool. 
[00:38:30]  I think you're right.  All right, thank you.  You're welcome.  Thanks, man.  John's got a question for Brittany.  John.  Yes, what's up, man?  We can't get off this masturbation.  I know.  Go ahead, John.  Let's see how to put this.  Bill's Fudge Packet Bottle.  It's just...  How far...  How far did we go?  Can you give us a letter?  Did we get down to the little grips, or...  Yeah, what letter did you get down to?  The U or the E?  I'm kind of busy when I'm doing it. 
[00:39:00]  I don't really look to see the lettering.  I don't know.  She never did lose it, did she?  No.  Oh, my God, no.  Brittany, your pennies are staying pink and green and blue.  Let's work off of the display model.  Now, this being the top...  I can hold the bottom.  It's not like it goes all the way.  You hold the bottom.  Do you hold the ribbed part in your hand?  I think the ribbed part goes in all the way.  Oh, okay.  Are we talking the first rib? 
[00:39:30]  I'm not...  I'm not popping.  Somewhere in between first and second rib?  And I'm going to guess she's a two-ribbed girl.  Two-ribbed?  I'd say two-ribbed.  Doesn't leave much more to hang on to after that.  So you palm the cap is what you're saying.  I don't palm it.  I don't palm the cap.  I do still hold it with my fingers.  Right.  Okay, sure.  You don't want to lose it.  Yeah.  Well, look at that.  Do you have, like, extension?  Can we put an extension on it, maybe, for, like, you know, when you're more advanced?  No, I don't think I want it to go any more in and more. 
[00:40:00]  Get an adapter, screw two bottles together?  Mike, what's going on?  What up, boys?  Hey.  I'd like to preface this comment by saying that I never saw the show.  Big Brother?  Okay.  No, I never saw it.  Based on that, I find Ms. Brittany to be an annoying, stuck-up, obnoxious little Long Island  chap.  I hope, for your sake, she's something to look like.  She's not from Long Island.  I know she's not, but she sounds like it.  Mike, we get this every time Brittany's on. 
[00:40:30]  I'm getting a headache.  And I got...  No, she's...  Don't turn off the radio.  I think she's awesome and she's adorable.  I hope so.  And she talks about her masturbation habits.  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  Why not?  Annoying.  She's annoying.  She's a virgin.  Yeah, but she's a wild virgin.  Yeah.  She's like the wildest virgin we've ever had.  She's a two-ribbed girl.  So, what are you holding out for, did you say?  Was it marriage or just the right guy?  No, just the right guy.  Just the right guy.  You haven't found him yet.  Yeah, just the right guy in love.  Haven't found him yet.  I don't know.  You've never been in love?  I don't think so. 
[00:41:00]  You don't think so?  I think there's a few questions.  Well, I don't know.  Maybe.  What about that longest relationship?  How long about?  A year.  A year?  Yeah.  And then he really needed to start, like, banging and you were like...  Yeah, that was a problem in the relationship.  See, I think it's going to be a disappointment at this point.  It might be, but I don't know.  I guess I'm not...  You think it's going to be this grand thing?  I don't have this big, grandiose idea.  I don't have a big plan or anything.  I just...  I don't know.  It's weird.  It's like, I just didn't.  And then I just keep getting older and older.  See, that's what happens.  Ask our own Earl.  He waited.  He waited longer. 
[00:41:30]  Earl's a virgin here.  Earl, come here.  Virgin.  This guy's a virgin.  Earl's a virgin.  Hey, Earl.  Look at Ben's laughing at him.  Earl's a virgin.  Now, Earl...  Speak for yourself.  Why did you decide to be a virgin for so long?  By the way, just in case anyone's wondering, Earl's a three-ribbed guy.  Oh, God.  That was mean.  That's what they call him, a fudge.  Virgin.  Now, Earl.  Yo.  What made you decide to be a virgin? 
[00:42:00]  Finding the right person?  Pathetic.  Pathetic.  Thank you.  So you're looking for it, but you just haven't found it.  So you are a virgin.  No.  Well, when did that happen?  You were when we first got here.  Well, that's true.  You're...  Shut up.  You're looking at...  I swear to God.  He's a virgin.  I swear to God.  If you weren't a virgin one day, you'd come bopping in here like Billy D. F. and Williams.  Your whole... 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Persona would change.  Yeah.  Black girl is dead.  That mustache would get a little fitter on him.  Right.  Billy D. Williams.  That's right.  Colt 45.  Look at how embarrassed he is.  Look how cute.  Dressed like Lando Calrissian.  Boom.  How can you tell he's embarrassed?  Look at him all smiling.  Can't see the...  He's all shaking his head.  Can't see the red through that.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[00:43:00]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Earl.  That's the girl that she was with and listening, probably.  What?  She's like, he's going to get it.  Earl is still a virgin.  No.  I'm not a virgin.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'm not going to lie about something like that.  No, I'm not.  It's starting to take over.  Hey, we have a 45-year-old virgin that calls our show.  No.  Don't wait until you're 45.  I know.  Earl, you're still technically...  This girl's body is a disaster, and she's still holding down for the right guy. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my gosh.  Stalker patty.  Earl, you're still technically a virgin.  No, I know the instance, and until she hit you with the pepper spray, you weren't really  doing it.  What happened?  Inappropriate, though.  All right, let's go to Robbie.  See, he's not going to admit it, but we know he's a virgin.  I'm telling you the truth.  Proof to us you're not a virgin.  Is this a video? 
[00:44:00]  No, no.  Tell us about your first time.  Everyone knows about my first time.  No.  Exactly.  Case closed.  No.  How old were you?  When you were first?  How old were you?  I'll just say it was within the last couple of years.  Oh, yeah.  You're so full of crap.  Last couple of years.  See, when we first got here, he said he wasn't a virgin.  Now he's fessing up that he was a virgin until two years ago, two, three years ago.  But he said he wasn't when we first got here. 
[00:44:30]  But now he was.  Right.  And now he's saying he is.  Let me tell you.  It's black earth in the future here.  Let me tell you something.  I still ain't late.  I'm 85 years old.  People flying in space cars.  I still ain't late.  Any advice, Terrell?  Brittany?  Should he hold out for the right guy, too?  Oh, leave him alone.  Look at him.  What's the last item you used, Terrell?  Bubba. 
[00:45:00]  Look, Robbie's still on the phone.  Hey, Robbie.  What's up?  Oh, not much.  I'm just trying to gauge the bottle bag.  Go back to Brittany.  Okay, yeah.  Go back to Bubba.  Yeah, because Earl's boring.  He's not going to give a say.  All right.  Well, listen.  Thanks, Terrell.  When you're holding on to the end of the bottle.  Yeah.  Let me just word this correctly.  Do your fingers get moist?  Yes.  Wow.  Hey, you're in a tube.  Hey, there you go.  Hey, look at that.  Well, yeah.  Obviously, you have to screw the top on a little tighter because the bottle's leaking.  Don't you take it out of the box, Ant?  Hey, look at that. 
[00:45:30]  Wow.  You and your puns.  She's using her attachment.  Let me go to Will.  Will, what's up?  Yo, I got a comment for Brittany.  Hold on, Earl.  Someone's going to prove you're still a virgin.  Go ahead, Will.  Yo, I got a comment for Brittany.  Okay.  Yeah, my name, my junk, the right guy.  Do you want it?  She's holding out for the right guy.  There you go.  I think that's old Bertie, man. 
[00:46:00]  He's driving his voice.  I don't know.  There's something about you that I just, I'm drawn to now.  I think, I think, yes.  I do want that.  That's what she's been waiting for.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what's going to put her over the top.  Oh, Lord.  Uncle John, what's going on?  Hey, how you guys?  How you doing?  Good.  Uncle John.  I can kind of prove that Earl's not a virgin.  I know a guy that banged him.  Oh.  He does.  That's so weird.  Dan from Hoboken's name.  The last thing Earl used was a jerry curl.  Is that a problem with jerry curl? 
[00:46:30]  Kevin, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing today, guys?  Brittany, I got a question for you.  Okay.  Is the back door a virgin also?  Oh.  Yeah.  You don't give up the back.  Yeah, no.  That whole don't count.  I don't know.  Back in the old days, they used to give up the back door and still say they were virgin.  Like hopping in an Indy car before you take your driver's test.  I've actually had that question a lot.  Really?  A lot of people think that.  And, of course, a lot of people mention the oral.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, God. 
[00:47:00]  That is wrong.  And the oral.  A lot of people mention that.  If you're a virgin, a lot of the girls, they do the oral to kind of keep the guy there  while he's waiting to be the right guy.  I have done the oral on one person.  Bravo.  One person.  Yes.  Our own Earl.  No.  Can I put in two cents here?  You can say whatever you want after that.  I don't think that you can just go around doing oral sex to everybody and be like, 
[00:47:30]  Oh, but I'm still a virgin.  I'm still blah, blah, blah.  I don't think.  Like, it's still something where he's making that noise.  There's definitely somebody over on that side of the room.  Eating ain't cheating.  That's what I've been trying to say.  Anyway, I'll shut up.  But you can't just do that.  You can't just go around.  I don't think that people, you know, like a lot of people that are really religious are  like total sluts.  They're like, Oh, but I haven't done that.  Right.  And I think that's lame.  You know, my thing is.  All right.  Stop it.  What the hell is that?  It's you.  Oh, no.  It's you. 
[00:48:00]  Come on.  All right.  Hey, we got audio of the guy.  Oh, we do?  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Really?  Wow.  Does that sound like the guy?  No?  No, this is the guy.  I got him.  He's on the phone here.  Hello?  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Bloody.  Where'd that come from?  Oh, man.  We got to take a break.  Brittany and Eddie from Big Brother, they're going to be appearing somewhere. 
[00:48:30]  I don't know.  Earl isn't a virgin.  It's confirmed.  We have tape of his first experience.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Who knew?  You've got some funky-tasting spunk.  We got the girl he was with.  You were with Earl?  I got it from a Negro.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  How did that happen?  Your spunk is funky. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Take it away.  Here's Earl right after they were done.  Do you use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore?  That's so classy.  I love blazing saddles.  More Brittany?  Wow.  I ain't talking, James.  What the hell is that, George?  All right.  We got to take a break. 
[00:49:30]  I don't play it.  Oh, exactly.  Oh.  All right.  Where are you guys appearing again?  Up on 112 East 75th Street between Park and Lexington.  It's the Temple of Israel, I want to say.  It's a Jewish synagogue.  I think that's this ballroom.  Tickets are on sale there tonight between 6 and 9.  1-12.  Kind of like a big brother reunion.  You've got six of us.  Six of us.  Cassandra, Will, George, Curtis.  Brittany and myself.  There you go.  Give clothes. 
[00:50:00]  Give them to me.  Now.  I'm Big Dick Black.  You're a girl.  You guys sticking around?  Yeah, we'll be around for a couple more minutes.  One more and then we're going to get out of here.  All right, cool.  We're going to get ready.  All right, cool.  O-B-N-F-N-E.  It's the kind of show where you can feel up your sister.  Feel up your sister.  Feel up your sister.  O-B-N-F-N-E.  You guys are awesome.  It's like a drug.  1-0-2-7.  That was ready.  That was.  It's O-N-A with a few of our friends.  Brittany and Eddie from Big Brother. 
[00:50:30]  They're heading out in a couple minutes here.  We've got a question.  This guy from Jersey wants to know,  Jamie, how is Giant Jaw?  Brittany, you want to tell you this one?  Jamie went to Las Vegas with us, what, last month?  Yeah.  About three weeks ago.  About three weeks ago.  Brittany, Jamie, Curtis, myself, and some production people from Big Brother.  We tried.  Went to Vegas.  I had a good time.  You had a better time than me, I think.  I was wasted.  She got trash. 
[00:51:00]  I had trash.  But we all went to a strip club, so it was kind of fun to see Jamie in a strip club.  It was pretty hilarious.  Curtis and I bought our lap dance.  You should have seen us squirm, man.  Really?  Did you enjoy the strip club?  Yeah, I've been in them before.  I was in the one that Jordan was in.  I've never seen Jordan.  That would be hilarious.  Is she back stripping?  I guess not.  I don't know.  I haven't talked to her at all.  Jordan, man.  Who the hell would want to pay to show dollars?  She's got no chest, she's got no body, she's disgusting.  She's a bitch.  Jordan, if you listen, you're a bitch and I hate you.  Wow.  Wow, that's pretty brave, considering she lives somewhere else. 
[00:51:30]  No, no, no.  No, no, thanks.  No, I'm a scum, thanks.  That's a little face, though.  I'm just kidding.  I felt bad.  I felt bad because Jamie and I had this big talk afterwards, and I just, you know, I...  Jamie, big jaw.  Well, I just, usually I choose friends that, like, have opinions and say things, you know,  and it's just hard.  I mean, I'm not trying...  She's fine, but it's just...  It's just hard when you...  It's hard to be friends with someone that is...  I'm so stuck up.  Just kidding.  I think she's too scared to say anything about anything, so it's just... 
[00:52:00]  And it's frustrating.  Because she was tedious to watch.  But that's cool, though, and I know what you're talking about.  Like, someone that gets on a show like Big Brother, and then all of a sudden they can't  say anything the least bit out there.  But, I mean, I can even...  Like, you've got to sit there.  I can give a little...  You two are maybe a little too much information.  Well, I think I'll go leeway for on the show.  Look at the rig we are on the bottle.  But, I mean, one thing, on a TV show, like, after the show, I'm like, okay, we'll try  to hang out and stuff, because I thought, okay, she was on TV, but it's no different  in real life.  And it's like, if you can't even tell me if you like fake boobs or real boobs better  than a strip club, when there's no cameras around, I'm like, what the hell? 
[00:52:30]  You know, I'm just like...  They both have their merits.  Shut up.  Do you like the fake ones or the real ones?  I like real better.  Yeah.  There you go.  Bravo.  I think fake look better in clothes.  Hey, there you go.  We were just saying that.  That's exactly what we said.  Fake boobs better when the girl is dressed.  Yeah.  And then once they take it off, you're like, ugh.  Yeah, exactly.  Looks like you're wearing invisible clothes.  Like, they're kind of holding them off and squishing them, but you don't see the clothing.  It's like the T-shirt that you wear with the tuxedo on it, you know? 
[00:53:00]  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Why not just walk around with that?  It's just the T-shirt with boobs on.  There you go.  Yeah, she likes the real boobs.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, real boobs are key.  I think she really likes strip clubs, too.  Oh, I love them.  Do you?  I've got a closet left hand.  You like that?  You never shared that bottle of fudge, did you?  Oh, didn't I?  No.  No.  You ever have any of those experiences?  A lot of girls have grown up or anything.  I've never made up with a girl.  No.  No, never made up.  You ever undressed in the same room?  Kind of look and giggle and touch each other.  I'm like the undressed, yes. 
[00:53:30]  I've looked, yeah.  Oh, yeah?  I've giggled.  Touched each other now.  Where have you been undressed with other girls?  Well, just like in locker rooms or at a friend's house.  You're changing.  Nice.  You're not like getting naked and like playing with you.  You're not going to play with yourself in front of a girl, but like, you know, you  just, you change and you're like.  Yeah.  I hear you.  I mean, boobs actually fascinate me.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Tell us what.  Me too.  I think because I have, I think because I have little boobs.  Yeah.  Like when I see a girl that has like big, real boobs, I'm just like, oh my God.  Like one of my friends has like gigantic boobs.  And I'm like, I just, like I asked her, I'm like, can I just touch it? 
[00:54:00]  Because it's like you.  So you touch them.  Well, not like fun, but just like, oh my God.  That's just like a weird.  Naked?  Nice.  You've touched them naked?  It's like a weird, weird mess.  Do you want to tell them about the little bet that you and Curtis had in Vegas?  No.  No?  Bet in Vegas.  No, because Curtis will kill me.  Who cares?  No.  Give us something.  I am not saying anything.  Leave, leave us with something.  Come on.  If you don't tell us, Eddie will, and then he might get it wrong.  Eddie will tell us.  It's fine with me, but Curtis will kill me.  And if it affects Curtis's job, you're dead. 
[00:54:30]  Eddie, you, go ahead.  Yeah.  Eddie doesn't care.  No.  No.  No.  What happened was, we went to Vegas, and Curtis and Brink, actually, I kind of got into it  because, just for the hell of it, we, we shoot out to Vegas, and in one of our  wild, drunken rants, we came up with the idea that, you know, Brittany's rent would be paid  for if we could get Brittany to make out with Jamie and go to the nipple land.  It wasn't.  Right.  I just had to, I had to, like, barely touch it. 
[00:55:00]  Like, second base kind of thing, but then also, also.  Wait, how much money did you collect for that?  It never happened.  Somebody, somebody dropped the ball.  I dropped the ball.  Oh.  I couldn't do it.  Not that she would do it, but.  You were pretty confident that she would.  Well, I was kind of playing with you guys.  You know.  Oh.  C.T.  The C.T.  Women.  Oh.  Women.  Hey, Bob.  It was a nice idea to not have to take a look.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, guys. 
[00:55:30]  How you doing?  Good.  I just wanted to call in and tell Brittany that I really, really enjoyed watching the show  only because she was always barefoot and she had the cutest toes.  That's it.  I know it's stupid, but.  Are you one of those foot guys?  Yeah, I guess so.  I got one good one.  I don't know.  Well, good for you, Ed.  God bless you.  So, you get a lot of mail about your feet?  I actually do. 
[00:56:00]  Do you?  I get a lot of, I want to suck your toes kind of mail.  Really?  Yeah.  My foot is as big as my hand.  Yeah, my foot's exactly as big as if I put my heel near my toe.  All right, wait.  Let's see your foot.  Don't worry.  It's not going to turn me on.  Okay.  It's small.  Yeah, you can tell by the shoes.  The shoes are pretty small.  I'm probably going to have fuzzy socks.  By the way, she sat on our toilet.  Yeah, that's a nice foot.  That's a small foot.  I know.  It's a little.  It's a nice little foot.  Oh, God.  I don't like my sock fuzzy down.  Oh, yeah.  God, yeah, it's as big as his hand. 
[00:56:30]  Look at that.  Eddie's stretched out hand is as big as her foot.  Now, people are going to say, hey, put your hand up.  I want to see how big, baby's foot is.  It's not like it's my hand.  I might be having grown since sixth grade.  I can still wear shoes that I had in sixth grade.  Isn't that funny?  Freak.  Not that I am.  I'm a male.  Sometimes she just falls over.  Okay, you have one leg.  Are you ready?  Listen, my one leg performs.  You know, I have a size of 13 foot. 
[00:57:00]  Someone is saying, no wonder you're still a virgin.  You want women.  Wow.  No, I don't.  I think the thing is, is that I'm not, like, afraid.  It's weird.  I don't know really why.  You're afraid.  That's a good start.  No, I'm not.  I'm not afraid to talk about stuff and, like, you know, think, maybe.  But I don't know.  It's weird.  People are out.  All right.  Bill, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Nothing, nothing.  Brittany sounds pretty cool.  I never watched the Big Brother show.  I think it was on the wrong night.  But I think the best of both worlds.  We should get Hart and Kimmy from Survivor back together. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah, Kimmy's a huge fan of our show.  Kimmy's cool.  From Survivor.  I don't want to see that.  Get a little couch action going between the two of them.  Yeah, that's reality programming.  Either that or give me a bottle of fudge, too.  Have a night.  The fudge bottle.  We've got to get a bottle of fudge.  Yeah.  And have, you know, maybe work the girls up to the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge with the fudge bottle.  Let's go buy some fudge and have Brittany autograph it, and then we'll just kind of have one.  Oh, my God.  Imagine an autographed bottle of fudge.  You know how much money we can get for that? 
[00:58:00]  eBay.  Or the actual original bottle.  Oh, God.  That's impossible.  We can only dream.  Can we make a substitute today here in the studio?  Brittany, you should bring in that bottle.  No, I'm fine.  Mail it to us.  Mail it to us.  Oh, my God.  It'll make our week.  When you get back to L.A., mail it to us.  We'll laugh so hard.  Oh, that's embarrassing.  In a plastic bag.  Make sure it hasn't been contaminated with anything.  We're still L.A. here.  We're going to clone you from the bottle. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  We should get you guys out of here.  Oh, man.  Well, thanks for coming in.  My God.  Thanks for having us.  Always fun.  Look at that.  We love Brittany.  Yeah.  Thanks, Greg.  I know.  Eddie, always fun to have in.  And Brittany's two for two.  Two for two on our appearances here.  Yes, you are two for two.  And for great radio.  All right, one more time.  You guys are going to be appearing at the seminar at some church or synagogue.  It's a synagogue.  It's the Temple of Israel in the city of New York.  It's 112 East 75th between Park and Lexington. 
[00:59:00]  6.30 tonight.  Between 6.30 and 9.  See, and I thought it was 6.00.  Are you sure it's 6.30?  It's only 6.30.  Look, they're fighting like the house.  Honestly, listen, I wouldn't be surprised if, like, Will and I go at it or Cassandra.  Eddie's kind of bossy.  He makes me stand up on the subway before the door opens.  He's like, you're going to get out in time.  He bosses me.  She goes to walk out in traffic.  I'm like, stop.  He does.  You don't stand at the edge of the platform looking for the train, do you?  No, he told me that.  He, like, I put my toe on the yellow and he's like, eh. 
[00:59:30]  You can't even do that.  You're the perfect candidate.  Out of town.  All bubbly.  That's bubbly.  Life is great.  Life is fine.  This homeless guy is going to push you on the track.  Pretty much it.  Food for the rats.  I look like Kenny.  Just push your head.  You guys are great.  Listen, thank you very much.  Where is that, though?  It's on...  I'll leave the information with you before I...  No, just say it real fast because we get distracted here.  Okay, one more time.  It is the Temple of Israel in the city of New York, 112 East, 75th Street, between Park 
[01:00:00]  and Lexington.  Perfect.  Okay.  6.30.  Six guys from Big Brother.  Yeah.  Well, thanks, man.  Six from the gang.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, guys.  Have a nice day.  Opie.  You guys are God.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something really dumb.  Hi.  This is Louis Black from The Daily Show, and you're listening to two of the most psychotic  human beings I've ever met.  My pals, Opie and Anthony, on 102.7 WNEW.  Thank you, Louis. 
[01:00:30]  Thank you.  Bye, my pals.  Oh, this kid.  212-757-1027.  Lots going on on the show today.  You want them on now?  What, this one?  Yeah.  I guess we could deal with it quickly.  Hello, Drudge Jr.  Hello, Anthony.  Now, you're 13 years old.  Mm-hmm.  You have a little website, and you want to be like Matt Drudge from The Drudge Report. 
[01:01:00]  Kind of, yeah.  Kind of.  So you're scooping, you're getting news like Matt Drudge does.  He scoops a lot of stories.  I'm trying.  So your latest scoop.  Are you wearing a fedora?  What?  Yeah, do you wear that fedora?  I can't find one.  Not one that fits a 13-year-old.  Is Matt Drudge your hero?  Yeah, kind of.  Kind of like your hero.  So you call yourself Drudge Jr.  Yeah, let's just try to get him around, you know?  All right.  Now, let's see. 
[01:01:30]  Wait, before he goes into what he did with us.  All right.  What other scoops have you had?  Oh, good question.  Because Matt Drudge is always ahead of the mainstream media with his stuff.  I'm on The Drudge Report right now.  Let's see what Drudge has.  Most of my stuff comes out of broadcasting because I have some insiders in Infinity and  at this crappy comedy world station.  You're 13.  You have insiders at Infinity Broadcasting?  No, one who claims to be.  He's probably just jerking me around or something. 
[01:02:00]  U.S. warns Russia over arms sales to Iran.  That's on Drudge right there.  Iran, Russia, defy U.S. with pact.  That's pretty big.  Travel to Europe on...  Playing God, human cloning.  There's all kinds of...  Drudge Report has so many stories.  Links to all the major newswire services.  And Drudge Jr., what's your biggest scoop to this day?  Well, nothing really major. 
[01:02:30]  I found something that KKK might have donated some money to Giuliani.  And Donnie might be moving into Imus' slot.  Okay.  Wait, so...  So, Don Imus is retiring and this is coming from a 13-year-old?  Well, he's not retiring, but when he does, it could be soon.  I haven't heard any of this.  I work for Infinity Broadcasting.  I've talked to people.  We usually know everything that's going on for the most part. 
[01:03:00]  But I haven't even heard that.  Hell, Drudge Jr., if you want an inside person, you should strike up a relationship with me.  I hire and fire most of the people around here.  Okay.  So, now, we'll get into what Matt Drudge, what Drudge Jr. has posted about us.  Okay.  On the OpieAnthony.com message report.  All right.  For those of you losers that listen to Lynn Samuels, here's an exclusive from me, Drudge Jr. 
[01:03:30]  That's what he writes.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony have engaged with talks with their agents.  You've got to get a little ground.  I typed that pretty fast.  I had to do it during social studies.  All right.  Drudge Jr. is in social studies writing his reports.  Opie and Anthony have engaged with talks with their agent about moving their popular show  to a new radio, internet radio station in L.A. called Comedy World.  They would replace the Slayton and Murphy show, which, spelt like the scary witch, 
[01:04:00]  which has just been fired.  This is not a joke, and I will have more information on this subject as it develops  from my mole from Comedy World.  Stay tuned to my website as this story develops.  Well, I have to make a retraction.  I know you're not talking to Comedy World.  That guy just made that up for some reason.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, are you retracting the entire story?  No.  What part are you not retracting?  I think that somebody talked to somebody about moving you to L.A. 
[01:04:30]  That was you, or that was one of your agents.  Somebody talked to somebody.  I'm pretty sure about that.  About us moving to L.A.?  Or moving to L.A.  Or syndicating you on L.A. legally.  That's great.  I love this.  I like Drudge Jr.  I was pretty sure that you talked to your agents about it, but, you know, I'm not going 
[01:05:00]  to...  And where does your source come from, Drudge Jr.?  Opie.  I told you, Insider in Infinity, Insider in Comedy World, and now Drudge said it, so I  thought I'd beat him to it.  What Drudge?  The Drudge.  He said that we were going to L.A.?  Yep.  When did Matt Drudge say something about us?  Yesterday on the air, at the beginning of the show, he said something like, uh, um, about  New York radio and how Opie and Anthony are moving to L.A., wink, wink. 
[01:05:30]  Something like that.  Matt Drudge said that about us.  Yeah, and since I've heard something about that, I thought that that was all I needed.  He's like Homer.  You rule, man.  I take back all the bad stuff I said about you.  I like Drudge Jr.  I like Drudge Jr. now.  What else you got, Drudge Jr.?  Now what?  What are the stories you're working on? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, are you working on anything?  You're working on something new.  You know how they go with the stories we're working on for 11 o'clock.  You know, what are you working on?  A couple of stupid things I'm just following around.  Like what?  Give us a little, give us a little something, something.  No, I don't want to say anything.  Give us a little tease.  Why would anyone want to go to your website?  You got to give us a little tease.  A lot of people listen.  Well, my website's pretty much falling apart.  Because my venue was on Lynn Samuels. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  And she's not letting me on the air anymore because she doesn't want me to call myself Drudge Jr.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So you're like a talk radio guy.  You kind of call these shows and you're on a lot of the radio shows.  I'm afraid.  We have another 13-year-old that wants in on this conversation.  Derek?  Hey, Drudge Jr.  Hey, Derek.  I know this kid.  Wait.  Do you go to the same school or are you in the same social media?  Yeah.  I'm my best friend.  He's across the room from me right now. 
[01:07:00]  Hey, Drudge, you good in school?  No.  Kind of.  Yeah.  You good in English?  No.  Hey, Derek.  If you're good in English, spell liable.  Liable.  L-I-B.  No, liable.  Spell slander.  Hey, Derek.  Yeah.  You got some dirt on Drudge Jr.?  Oh, no.  I know your stories, Drudge Jr.  Drudge Jr., why aren't you using your Drudge Jr. voice?  You're talking in your regular voice.  Shut up, Derek.  Yeah, let's hear your Drudge Jr. voice. 
[01:07:30]  Let's hear it.  How do you talk like Drudge Jr.?  This is Drudge Jr.  Kind of like the real Drudge, pretty much.  You're obsessed with Matt Drudge?  He pretty much hates everybody.  You're a damn bleeding heart liberal.  You're not like Drudge.  Shut up, Derek.  Remember this, dude?  Remember the people?  Cool.  All right, Derek.  You don't have anything.  I know a story.  He's working on a...  What?  Some stupid crap about Winsamuels' site.  Yeah?  He went to alldots.com and got, like, the address for the guy who stole Winsamuels with one N. 
[01:08:00]  All right, why don't you go draw some cartoons, Derek?  I draw a lot of cartoons.  You guys are a little...  These are the...  These guys are the future of America, right?  Drudge Jr., I heard you're working on a story.  Milk Lady, is she really an escaped convent?  Okay.  Nothing like that?  No.  Who told you that?  The janitor at school's a kid-toucher?  No big...  We had a kid-toucher teacher that got arrested.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  He got arrested last year.  It was my teacher.  Did he touch you?  No.  What's the story?  What are you, ugly?  He touched...  He wasn't really a kid-toucher.  He was just...  He touched Drudge Jr.  Shut up, Derek.  He touched Drudge Jr.  I didn't even have that teacher.  All right, what's the story?  Now we need to know.  Well, there was some teacher that was accused of molesting a kid.  It's probably not true.  Where did he molest him?  He was tutoring after school or something, and this kid claims that he molested him or  something. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  I hear now he's teaching for a comedy world out in LA.  Is that true?  Drudge Jr.?  All right.  We'll let you guys go.  All right.  All right.  Well, Drudge Jr., if you have any rumors about us or anything you want to comment on, give  a call.  We'll deny or confirm anything for you.  Okay.  We are now one of those.  Deny away, Anthony.  Just deny away.  Waiter, he doesn't sound like he believes me.  So, if Drudge Jr. swears that we're going to LA.  Well, if I don't want to go to LA.  At least you're going to be syndicated in LA or something. 
[01:09:30]  All right.  Well, we've been talking about our want to do that for quite some time now.  But, Drudge Jr., that wouldn't be a big stretch.  Right.  Man, this kid does have more info than, like, a David Hinckley.  Yeah, see, he does.  At least he's trying.  All right, Drudge Jr.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right, Derek.  See ya.  Deny away.  Deny away, Anthony.  That's so funny, man.  Let's go to Tom.  What happened to Lemonade Stands?  Yeah, exactly.  He's got an investigative reporter website. 
[01:10:00]  Tom, what's up?  Do kids play baseball in the front of the house anymore?  It's over, Johnny.  You wonder why they're shooting up schools.  Who listened to talk radio when they were 13?  God, that's scary.  And the one kid's calling the other kid a bleeding heart liberal.  What is it?  I don't even know what that means.  A 23-year-old.  God.  Have a good one, boys.  All right.  That is scary.  Tony.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's going on?  What are you?  Woody, a feverish and butthead on the radio?  Yeah, they did sound like that.  They sounded like that a bit.  Oh, they're ridiculous. 
[01:10:30]  I'm Drudge Jr.  Yeah, yeah.  You're a dumbass.  Fire, fire, fire.  Shut up.  All right.  Opie and Anthony hope to get to L.A. sometime or something.  Yeah, yeah.  They're going to be, like, masturbated there.  All right.  Drudge Jr. reporting pizza day.  Move to Friday or not? 
[01:11:00]  Stay tuned.  Should we talk about Captain Hook?  You guys hire some weird people, man.  Our intern showed up today with a patch on his eye.  Arr!  And then above the patch on his forehead, a huge bandage.  And he swears that he was in, what, a car accident? 
[01:11:30]  A car accident.  A motorcyclist, I guess, hit him.  Arr!  Maybe.  Arr!  Arr!  Arr!  But we think he's, like, faking.  There's been...  Now, there's been some speculation as to the validity of your injuries.  Everyone was speculating during the day that, um, wondering if, if it's real.  Because some people have looked under the patch.  I have not looked under the patch and said there's nothing wrong with the eye. 
[01:12:00]  What happened to you?  Yeah, what happened?  You got hit by a car.  You look completely ridiculous.  You got hit by a motorcycle.  Yes.  But not you personally, your car.  My car.  Okay, so you're driving.  Driving, making a left-hand turn.  You're making a left.  And the motorcycle decides on going left to me.  He decides to do what?  To pass on my left.  Oh, to pass on your left.  Yes.  So, you're making a left.  He's passing you on the left.  And he runs into what?  My driver's side.  Your driver's side door.  Mm-hmm.  So, what happens?  Wait.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  My head goes through my driver's side window.  Oh, it did? 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  How fast does he go?  Uh, I don't know.  22 miles an hour.  Mm-hmm.  And you're making your left.  Yes.  And he hits your door.  Your head goes through the window?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Yes.  So, you hit your head.  And what happened to your eye?  Uh, glass got in it.  Glass in your eye.  And what happened underneath that patch on your head?  That's, that's where my head went through the windshield.  What kind of injury?  Just, just a, just a couple scrapes.  Couple of scrapes.  Yeah.  Hard head.  Anything?  Any, uh, hospital?  Yes.  You went to the hospital?  Did they stitch your head up or anything? 
[01:13:00]  I stitched my head up a little bit.  Yeah.  Washed out my eye.  Washed out your eye.  Why the patch?  Because, uh, I can't really, I can't really open up my eye.  So, it's just.  You can't open it?  No, not, not well, because the glass in the eye kind of hurts.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Can we look at the, uh, scratches on your head?  You've got to see them.  No, I hear they can't take it off.  You can't take it off.  I was, what?  Okay, no, no, I'm still, look, I'm still willing to believe this. 
[01:13:30]  I'm still willing to believe this.  You got scratches, but they had to be stitched.  How many stitches did you get?  Three stitches.  All on one cut or two on one cut?  No, all on one cut.  All on one cut.  Three stitches.  Minor, yes.  Is there any way to lift it up to take a look underneath?  If you really, I'd rather not.  I mean.  All right, Ben.  Ben, see you.  I'm trying to take it off out there and rub your eye.  Well, you were.  No, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the bandage on his head.  Well, lift up the patch of it.  Yeah, let's look at the eye. 
[01:14:00]  I really can't open up.  I've shown Rick before.  I really can't open up my eye.  I always do.  You just, you can't really.  I mean, he's blinking.  That eye's blinking a lot.  I have a question.  Yeah.  All right, Rick, to you.  You said you had glass in your eye.  Yes.  How come you were rubbing your eye before at this glass?  Because it bugs the hell out of me.  Oh.  Didn't they get all the glass out?  Yeah, they did, but it scratches.  It scratches.  It scratches.  It scratches, huh?  Scratches in your eye.  Yes.  Well, that happens.  The cornea gets scratched open. 
[01:14:30]  Yes.  And it takes time to heal.  And that's the only injuries you had was the glass in the eye and the stitches above  your patch?  Yeah.  My driver's in the window shattered.  Let's see the stitches.  I really can't.  I'll come in.  The next time I'm here, I'll show you the skull.  You know, it would be totally...  No, don't do it, Steve.  You know, it would be...  I'm covering my head now.  It's going to hurt.  You know something?  We've all had stitches.  You can take the...  My doctor told me not to.  I don't want to get infected.  I swear... 
[01:15:00]  No, I'm covering my head now because I don't want to close anybody in the studio.  No, no.  Don't worry.  No one's going to pull it off.  Yes, they will.  No, no.  Really, no one pulled it off.  But the thing is, this would totally be resolved just if we saw some stitches.  I must say, everyone has been talking behind your back saying that you're facing it.  It feels very suspicious.  Now, Rick, was there something behind, like, I heard a story that he couldn't make it in  one day.  He couldn't make it in.  Well, last week, he never made it in on Monday, which was the snow day, saying that, you know,  the trains weren't running.  Well, that's fine, but... 
[01:15:30]  But, you know what?  Monday wasn't that bad and trains were running.  I didn't say trains weren't running.  He couldn't get to the train station, but...  Hey, Jeff, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, what's up?  I know for a fact that this guy's story is a bunch of crap.  Why?  Because I know for a fact that when you get glass in your eye, they have to cover both  eyes because your eyes don't move independently.  No.  You move one, the other one's going to move, so the glass is going to scratch your eye  no matter what.  But the glass is out of his eye, so if it's just scratched, they're not going to make  him go around blind.  What hospital is it? 
[01:16:00]  Northern Westchester.  Northern Westchester.  Okay.  Emergency.  I feel sorry.  I feel like I'm kind of...  What?  What?  Like an idiot.  No, no.  Don't ever feel like an idiot.  Everyone's looking at me really funny.  Well, just take the patch off, show us the stitches, and then we all look like idiots.  But I really would rather not because...  Next time I come in, I'll show you the scar.  No, because you might cut yourself.  Right.  That's what I do.  That's pathetic.  Stinky.  When he first came in, he said he didn't want to take the patch off because he still has  glass in it.  Right.  Well, I think there probably is... 
[01:16:30]  That's what he said to me.  There's a glass in it?  This is a little weird, man.  I'm telling you.  He was rubbing your eye.  Because it itches because of the scratch.  I think this kid came in with a fake injury, man.  No, come on.  No, I'm still...  I totally am willing to believe you.  How about we all put...  Now, here's a little more of what happened last week.  All right, Rick.  Wednesday, he was supposed to be in.  Yes.  I never got a phone call.  He knows my number.  He's left me messages before.  Well, Rick, come on.  Nothing...  I don't like calling you either.  No. 
[01:17:00]  When was this accident?  It was about my hometown.  Where?  I went Wednesday.  To my car.  And that's why you didn't call Rick?  Yeah, it really was.  But how come you found the time to call Steve?  All right, hold on.  No, AJ.  All right, here we go.  You didn't really listen to me.  All right, let's...  I'm just trying to figure this out.  I understand.  Did you get me?  It sounds a little...  All you have to do is pull down the bandage.  I will show you...  And then we look like tools.  All right.  On Wednesday...  On Wednesday...  We've all had stitches.  All you have to do is go like this.  Show the edge of the stitch and boom. 
[01:17:30]  What's going to happen?  I'll show you on Wednesday.  This is going to come off.  All right, let him talk.  Now, what happened?  My car...  Steve, you got something on this?  No, let him tell his story.  Your car?  My car...  I left the dome light on in my car, so my car didn't start, so the battery was dead.  Okay.  And when I got it jumped, I was on the way to the station.  That's...  I called when I found out my car was dead.  Okay.  And then on the way to the station, you had the accident?  What did you call?  By accident, I called Steve.  And your whole head went through the windshield?  No, the side window.  The side window. 
[01:18:00]  Because the motorcycle hit him on the side, so it threw his head through the side window.  What was the name of the guy in the motorcycle?  Well, you can't give out names like that, right?  Well, we can always dump it out.  Ben?  No, you know what I love about this, too, is that he can't find to call any of us.  And I love the excuse that our interns all of a sudden have.  I don't know the number.  I'm actually going to be in defense of this, too, because I really...  I have trouble calling, because I don't know anyone but Obie's number.  But, Ant, we fixed that problem weeks ago.  We all gave him phone numbers, said, this is the... 
[01:18:30]  You've got to call us.  Mike has a good point.  I've been hearing from...  All right, all right, all right.  All right, that's boring, but Mike has a good point on line nine.  Well, let me...  We'll go to Mike.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  It's WDNAW.  Dude.  Hey.  What happened to the dude on the motorcycle, and why was he out on Wednesday in the snow and  the rain on a motorcycle?  It makes no sense.  It wasn't raining and snowing on Wednesday.  It was crappy on Wednesday.  It really wasn't.  All right.  What happened to the guy on the bike?  Yeah, what happened to the guy on the bike?  He really just... 
[01:19:00]  My car was more destroyed than his...  But what happened to him?  Wait, the guy had to go flying.  He really didn't.  We weren't going that fast.  But wait, what happened to him?  He came from...  He was just kind of...  And he left?  Yeah.  Wait, wait, he just...  All right.  Hold on.  Okay, all right, all right, all right, all right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I haven't asked you to report outdated this time.  If you guys...  What, you have an accident report, too?  That's fake, too?  Yeah, that's fake, too.  Wow.  I know people have had...  If you guys will...  I think it's a flop for airtime. 
[01:19:30]  Well, it's working.  I mean, tell you, it's working.  Now, he hit the door.  Yes.  It was enough for...  Let me just get this straight.  It's enough force to physically move the vehicle enough that your head...  It moved your car enough.  Yeah.  Because in order for your head to go through the driver's...  Pass the driver's side window, your car has to move to put your head through the window.  It's not your head that moves.  When your head goes through anything, it is the actual vehicle moving into your head.  So, he hits your car with enough force to move the vehicle so your head goes through the window. 
[01:20:00]  Yes.  Basic physics.  But nothing happens, and he rides his motorcycle away?  Swear to God.  I haven't asked her before.  I'll drain it.  It's not fake.  It's nothing fake.  Is your car here?  No.  How did you get here?  It's a train.  How did you get to the train station?  Car.  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, listen.  Hey.  This guy is so full of it, he doesn't want to show you the stitches, because he doesn't have any.  I know.  There's no reason in hell.  I work in the emergency room. 
[01:20:30]  There's no reason in hell why he can't show you those stitches, if he has them.  Hmm.  And that's like a...  Where'd you get that bandage?  Out of your side.  Wayne Reed, right around the corner.  I actually got a four key in here.  He doesn't believe me.  It's barely on your forehead.  With this one, this one's just great.  It's kind of popping up.  You might be able to even look underneath.  Hey, and will you agree that maybe you might see some swelling in that area?  You can't tell, because the bandage is you.  Not even around his eye.  Jerry.  Yeah. 
[01:21:00]  Hey, Jerry.  Hi.  Yeah.  I just got into a car accident, and I got 50 stitches across my eyelids, and they didn't  put any bandages on me.  No, it's not on his eyelids.  Oh, no, because...  No, he's got...  This is what he's got.  He's got a patch over his eye, because he had a little glass in there, and he scratched  up his eye, even though you can't really tell when he lifted up the patch, and then  he has a bandage above the eye, where he has some stitches.  A bandage is above the eye.  What make motorcycle was this, sir?  Let's put it this way. 
[01:21:30]  I just received 50 stitches.  It was a Honda.  No one drives Hondas.  It was a...  I drive a Honda.  People drive the Hondas.  It was a Honda, and he hits the door.  What did he say to you after he hit you?  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  And then he took off.  No.  I mean, he waited around for the police.  He waited for the cops.  All right.  All right.  That's why I have a police report, which I will bring to you next time I'm here, so  you guys don't think about it.  All you have to do is show us the bandage.  I don't...  Everyone is like...  Rachel.  Okay. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  What's up?  People's heads don't go through driver's side windows.  Well, no.  It can happen.  It can happen.  How would a motorcycle driver drive away if it hit him with enough impact to make his  head...  Well, that's what I'm saying.  A lot more damage would be done to the guy.  He turned his head so it was head on.  Don't buy it.  No way.  All right.  I got something for him.  Okay.  It looks like you have nice, poofy, shampooed hair.  Did you take a shower recently? 
[01:22:30]  I washed my head.  I didn't take a shower.  Did you take off the bandage?  No.  I was still not too much.  I swear.  That's a dry bandage.  It's not wet.  It's not wet.  It's soggy.  It would be all messy.  I washed my hair.  That is a brand new bandage.  But wouldn't it come off if it got wet a little?  It has to be good.  How can you keep it from getting wet washing your hair?  Because...  Very good question, Opie.  Thank you.  Okay.  Detective Opie.  Let's see.  Take the bandage.  No, I don't want to.  Anne-Marie.  You've got to take that bandage.  I'm really...  I mean, and considering how much he's touching it and pushing on it... 
[01:23:00]  I don't want this.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  Hi, Brian.  Hi.  You're not getting out of working in the kitchen on Saturday.  Hi, Anne-Marie.  Hi.  Hey, what happened to him?  Well, I don't know about the accident because I wasn't working whenever you got in the accident.  But I can tell you he's very accident prone.  Hang up, Anne-Marie.  Hang up the phone.  Why is that?  What's the matter, Brian?  Keep her on the phone.  I work with her.  Trying to figure this out. 
[01:23:30]  What do you mean he's accident prone?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, fine.  Tell her about...  Tell them about the incident.  The other incident.  How many incidents have you had, Brian?  Oh, my God.  We're on to something.  Tell them about the hot boiling water on my crotch.  You can tell them that.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, that's right.  You can tell them that.  He's a regular over at the Hudson Valley Hospital.  I think he gets like a group rate, you know?  Really?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, he falls...  Well, you know, like a lot of people can fall down the stairs, but Brian can actually fall  up the stairs and get hurt. 
[01:24:00]  It's like that Munchausen by proxy syndrome, only without a child.  He just does it to himself.  All right.  Hold on, Emory.  But he gets tension.  You do that?  What town was this in?  Yorktown.  I live in Yorktown, yeah.  Yorktown.  Okay.  Bill, you work in Yorktown?  No, it's Phil.  Phil, you work in Yorktown?  No, no, no.  I live in Yorktown.  But listen.  Okay.  I got a friend that's a state trooper.  Yeah.  Was it the state trooper that helped this kid?  Yeah.  Yeah?  I got a friend that's a state trooper. 
[01:24:30]  He would have told me.  He just came on a motorcycle to see me.  He would have told me if there was a motorcycle accident.  And besides, there's so much sand on the roads, especially right after the blizzard, there  was no way that anybody's driving a motorcycle right here.  Well, I've seen people drive a motorcycle.  I have the police report, I swear to you.  I'll bring it in next time I see you.  All you have to do is take the bandage off.  I don't want to.  What police department?  Like, what area?  Is there any way we can call right now and verify that there was an accident?  What area?  What road did it happen on? 
[01:25:00]  What road did it happen on?  What road was it?  It was in Pleasantville.  What road?  What road?  Pleasantville Road.  Dude, you came to work taking an accident, man.  Dude, hold on.  Maybe I'm embellishing it a little bit.  That's scary.  Embellishing a little bit.  All right, now we're getting on to it.  What is embellishing a little bit?  We work with a bus.  What's embellishing a little bit?  How much is embellished?  Be honest.  No, I really got hit by a motorcycle, Mike.  Maybe my head didn't go through the window.  Was it glass?  All right. 
[01:25:30]  All right.  Maybe the head didn't go through the window.  So it hit the window.  No, well, I think...  So there's no glass in your eye.  There is glass.  From where?  What broke?  No, my window did break.  But my head might not have went through the window.  It might have been his...  Wait, let me...  Mike.  Mike, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  All right.  I always can't water glass for a living.  Yeah.  All right?  It takes almost a hammer to put go through a side window.  They're not meant to break.  Right.  This guy must have got creamed if he could have even come close to get his head through  a side window.  So you're saying maybe it was the guy?  The motorcycle guy's helmet? 
[01:26:00]  Maybe it was...  Maybe it was...  From across the car?  But he just drove away?  No.  He was fine.  I have the accident report.  I'll give you the guy's number when I get home.  I'll call you.  So then what...  If your head didn't go through, what's on your head?  It was the glass shattered onto my head.  Okay.  All right.  It hits.  Glass shatters on your head.  And there's enough to...  Oh, lift it up.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  You've got to lift that damn thing up.  You've got to.  I'm dying to see this now.  Lift.  It's got to be... 
[01:26:30]  I really don't want it.  I'm feeling really...  That's the purpose here.  We're trying to...  We're working this out.  We're working with...  We're working with single white male.  I'm telling you.  We're working through this.  You effing freak.  Keith, the cop.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We're trying to recreate the accident scene here.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's a cop.  Here's a cop that's been on many...  Yes.  ...details.  Okay.  I've seen many accidents.  So what you're saying is you're in the left-hand lane attempting to make a left-hand turn?  No.  I'm in my right lane making a left-hand turn. 
[01:27:00]  Making an illegal turn.  Okay.  Wait.  You're making an illegal turn there?  No, no.  It's legal.  Are you in the turning lane?  You're going left.  It's a one-way street.  One lane.  I mean, not one lane.  I'm sorry.  One lane each direction.  Yes.  Okay.  So it doesn't matter left or right.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Pleasantville Road.  What university is there?  Quickly.  Quick University.  Okay.  All right.  University.  Pleasantville Road.  And you're at an intersection.  What road are you turning on to?  This is a familiar route because you're on your way to work. 
[01:27:30]  I was on your way to work and school and all that other stuff.  You take this every day.  So Pleasantville, you make a left on?  Manville.  Manville.  Manville.  Okay.  All right.  Approximately how far back is the motorcycle when you make the turn?  All right.  20 feet.  And he passes you over the double yellow.  I think what might have happened was that his foot, what he said was his foot slipped off  the brake pedal and he kept going into my car.  His foot slipped off the brake pedal.  He didn't use the handshake.  He doesn't use that front brake.  So his foot slipped and he went in. 
[01:28:00]  So it was just, so he's almost like next to you.  Yeah.  And he builds up enough speed to fly into your car and even shatter a window and fly off  his motorcycle so his helmet hits the window.  Just.  How fast were you going?  I was stopped because I was making a turn.  But I mean, how fast were you going on that road before you came to a stop?  30?  35?  Maybe.  There's no way.  Okay.  I have a conclusion.  I have a conclusion.  All right, Keith.  All right, Keith.  I have a conclusion. 
[01:28:30]  After being affiliated with the show for almost two years, we have a lack of security.  Because this guy should just not be in.  Who does the screening?  Now, Keith, you've talked to a lot of people that you might be arresting, you might not be,  and you get stories out of them that you can tell right away if they're true or false.  You're a seasoned cop.  This is really, this is shit.  Keith, you ever watch Cops and you see him question in the guy and it's like, this is  so, like, this isn't panning out.  There should be beat the sweat rolling down this guy's forehead. 
[01:29:00]  Is there?  Let me see.  No.  No.  Is there?  No.  I'm fat, so I'm telling you this.  Next time he comes to work, I'd like to see the car.  All right, Keith.  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  A lot of people are saying you'd be in a neck brace.  Yeah, what happened to your neck?  Nothing?  Nothing.  Swear to God.  My head may not have went through the window.  All right.  Might not have went through the window.  I have a police report.  All right, so now, like, your head didn't go through the window, so let's see the stitches.  No.  You have no stitches.  No. 
[01:29:30]  We are, we've drawn the conclusion now that you do not have stitches under those bandages.  No, it's not what we want to believe.  We have drawn the conclusion through questioning and working through this that you cannot possibly  have three stitches on any cut under that bandage.  Okay.  You don't, do you?  No.  Okay, fine.  You have a scratch.  Yeah, right.  What is it?  It's a scratch.  It's a scratch.  Yes, I embellish a little bit.  So you embellish with the stitches.  Then you could take it off.  Maybe it's a cut. 
[01:30:00]  Did you indeed go to the hospital?  Yes, I did.  Take off the bandage.  You can take it off.  It's embarrassing because it's probably not going to be anything there.  Don't even be embarrassed.  Just take it.  Can you see a cut on my finger, too, if you really want to?  You can redeem, you can redeem yourself.  Take the bandage off, we'll laugh at you, and then we'll move on.  We'll laugh and we'll move on.  Let's go.  I want to see a cut on my finger that I got there.  Take the bandage.  No, just the bandage on your head.  Just the one on your head.  Take the bandage.  You've got to take it off now.  Here it comes.  It's going to hurt.  Let's take it off.  Let's take it.  You see that?  Wait a minute. 
[01:30:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Turn your head.  I am scared for my safety.  There's nothing.  Dude, I was honestly expecting maybe a cut.  Yeah, at least a little cut.  A little cut.  There's nothing.  There's nothing.  I mean, nothing there.  Dude, there is nothing there.  Holy ass.  There's absolutely nothing.  I am scared for my safety.  People, I can't stress to you enough, like not even, there's not even an abrasion.  There is nothing under that.  I saw them.  It went from three stitches to the head going to the window, and there's nothing under there. 
[01:31:00]  Because I don't put it in.  That is skin on the same side of each head.  It does not look any different.  There is not even any swelling or anything.  Dude, there's nothing.  Nothing hit.  I haven't seen this before.  Okay.  Give me what they call it.  Was it Earl's Friendly on the motorcycle?  Was that it?  Earl's Friendly on the Man?  Now let's go.  Now let's go phase two.  Dude, take the patch off.  Take the patch off.  You don't need the patch.  Take the patch off.  Obviously, you didn't have that.  Take the patch off.  Open your eye. 
[01:31:30]  No, I really can't open my eye.  Open your eye.  That is true.  It's not tearing.  It's not red.  It's not red.  The whites of your eye are white.  I can't even open my eye.  How many fingers?  I can see that of my right eye.  I can see five.  Close your right eye.  Open the other eye.  You can't.  Open the eye.  Open the goddamn eye.  There's nothing wrong with your eye.  Hey, please don't do this anymore.  I swear.  You're scaring us.  There's nothing wrong with your stupid eye.  Open the eye.  Open the eye.  Single white male.  Open the eye.  There's nothing wrong with it.  You have nothing on your eye. 
[01:32:00]  I swear to you, there's something wrong with my eye.  There's something on your forehead.  You had a huge patch.  There's nothing on your eye.  Saying you couldn't even take the patch off the shower.  There's nothing on your forehead.  Holy S.  That is the best.  Now, look.  All right.  It's opening up.  Yeah, it's opening up a little bit.  All right.  I swear, if you guys...  It's opening.  Yes.  All right.  Open it up.  You embellish it about the eye.  Open it.  No.  Pull the bottom lid down a little.  That really does hurt.  Well, pull it down.  I just want to see if it's red.  Pull the bottom lid down. 
[01:32:30]  Now, open the other eye.  I can't open up my eye.  Hold it open.  That really does hurt.  Take the ping.  Hold it open a little.  Hold your eye open.  Just hold it open.  It's...  I want to see if there's any irritate...  Look, it's totally white.  Dude, do you see any red?  I swear to her.  It looks like his other eye.  There's no red.  There's nothing wrong with you.  I mean, there are a little bloodshot, but his other eye is bloodshot, too, so...  There's nothing wrong with you.  They're both the same. 
[01:33:00]  But please wear the patch.  Feel free to wear the patch.  With my parrot.  Please feel free to wear the patch.  All right.  That's...  Look at Hope.  He's freaking out over here.  Hey, in one...  Hope.  He's freaking out.  Who the hell screams these people?  Not always that.  What's up, bud, Ben?  Brian is a little weird.  Do you remember the first couple days you showed up to work?  He, like, brought in pies and was buying us coffee and was just...  Well, that's nice.  You want to make a good impression.  I'm not going to delve off into any other directions here that don't have any validity with this case that we're working on right here. 
[01:33:30]  The injury case.  The injury case.  I still got to know.  Did you embellish with the motorcycle?  No.  I have the police report.  I will bring it in.  All right.  We will...  We are looking forward to seeing the police report.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for the friggin' half-hour radio.  Steve, you're not going home early today, are you?  No.  Okay.  Not at all.  Steve, we've got to get at least a still picture of the unveiling of the police. 
[01:34:00]  Okay.  What were you working on before we pulled you in?  Talk to me there, Brian.  That's you.  What were you working on before we...  Nothing.  Nothing?  I'm checking out his feedback.  All right.  Okay.  Great.  We'll let you continue ahead on your job.  All right.  You can wear the patch if your eye is hurting a little bit.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  That was great.  Take your bandage with you.  We wouldn't want to get any infections from all the blood on there. 
[01:34:30]  That is great.  What's the matter?  Nothing.  I'm a little hurt.  You're a little hurt?  I feel like an ass.  Well, you know something?  Well, open your eye!  And then we can, like, move on.  You're still, like, faking that you can't open the eye.  The thing is, I understand.  You feel like an ass.  But when you do certain things and they don't pan out and there's consequences, the one  consequence is looking like an ass.  Yeah.  So you did this.  Now you move on and you learn.  That may be embellishing.  You said you had stitches.  There's nothing on your forehead. 
[01:35:00]  Nothing at all.  Next time, you fake a knee injury.  You wrap it up in an ace bandage.  No one could call you on it.  You just say, it hurt.  I hurt my leg.  Okay.  But a head wound is like, wow, that's a tough one because it's right there.  Over my voice, that wound.  And the pad, even, you know something?  If you're just a head wound, maybe that way.  But then you add the patch, it's a little much.  Okay.  A little much.  We might have believed if you just had the patch.  Or the bandage.  Not both, though.  It's a bolt.  Put it over the top.  But next time, a leg injury, back injury, something you can't really, say, take the bandage off. 
[01:35:30]  Jay.  Dude.  I'm talking to this guy.  Call security.  Hide behind something.  You'll never see a freaking accident report.  He's lying.  He's a psycho, bro.  All right?  Thank you.  Wait, wait, wait.  He said he feels like an ass.  That's because he's busted.  Now he's about to strike.  You're not going to strike, are you?  I have a hand.  I feel like you're going to do it.  All right.  Can we check his clothes and stuff?  For real.  You're not going to go crazy, are you?  He's who he is, man.  Get rid of him.  Do you own any guns? 
[01:36:00]  No guns.  Do you have any guns on you?  No.  Do you have any needles in your pocket?  Okay, let's frisk them over.  I'm not going to get stuck in here, am I?  Nice and beans.  Can we check his clothes for weapons?  I don't think he's carrying any weapons, Opie.  You thought he had stitches.  No, we didn't think he had stitches.  But, you know, I would think he was just trying to garner a little sympathy.  Are you the man of a thousand faces?  Excuse for the day off.  All right.  We can move on now.  All right. 
[01:36:30]  Thank you very much.  You can go back to or whatever.  And don't feel too bad, you know.  You pay, you know.  You do something.  It doesn't pan out.  You pay.  And now you'll forever be the eyepatch guy.  What good message board name could it be?  Captain Psycho.  Captain Psycho.  I'm honored.  All right.  All right.  Well, continue with looking at instant feedback.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You can turn around and there you go. 
[01:37:00]  There you go.  There he goes.  Out the door.  Watch, don't hit your head with the door.  That would hurt.  Lock that studio door.  Holy S.  Where the hell are you firing these people?  That was great.  That was great.  People are tuning in halfway through going, what the hell is going on?  It went from an A-team type crash.  Why don't you explain really fast?  Summarize.  I know.  Summarize what happened.  Well, Opie, our intern came in today. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, he...  What's his name?  Brian.  This is Brian.  He came in.  He had a big bandage on his forehead.  Huge.  Huge.  Yeah, very big bandage.  Took up half his forehead.  On his forehead.  And an eye patch over the left eye.  His left eye.  Cleaning.  He had it in an accident.  A car and a motorcycle.  He was making a left.  So he went out to get coffee or something.  And we all started whispering in the back office.  We're like, holy S.  The guy's shaking.  It just didn't seem... 
[01:38:00]  Didn't add up.  Didn't add up.  He was trying to get off of work, I think, or an excuse for not coming in.  Because he didn't show up Wednesday.  Is that it, Rick?  Didn't show up Monday or Wednesday.  Didn't hear from him at all.  Yeah.  So basically...  And Rick's just a prick to work for.  So basically...  So he, like, really rags these guys.  Basically, he should be fired.  But he had an excuse.  And the excuse was that he was in this accident.  Yeah, he...  Hence the patch on his eye and the big, huge bandage on the forehead.  On his head.  And people were calling him on it.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, in the office.  We were talking.  And then we decided we'd just go on the air and hash it out.  Well, he comes in and says...  He was making a left.  The motorcycle was going straight around him.  They crashed.  His head went through the driver's side window.  Cutting his head.  Requiring three stitches in the ER, Opie.  And he had glass in his eye, which scratched the cornea.  And that's what the eye patch was for.  After some questioning about some things that didn't quite pan out... 
[01:39:00]  Everyone is scared now.  Look at everyone's face.  Might have been embellishing.  Don't let you outside.  Everyone's in the studio.  He might have been embellishing.  He's the only one outside the studio now.  And that door's locked.  Freaked out.  So he said he might have been embellishing the story.  Who comes up with this crap?  He wouldn't take the bandage off his eye.  Off his head.  Off his forehead.  He wouldn't take the bandage off.  No one's going outside.  So no work's being done.  He said he didn't want to get infected.  He was lying right there standing in front of us.  Saying, I can't take it off. 
[01:39:30]  It'll get infected.  My doctor said no.  When we finally did get him to take the bandage off, because he said he was embellishing.  And his head did not go through the window.  Just some glass broke from the motorcycle guy's helmet hitting the window.  Or whatever.  He got cut.  But we wanted to see the cuts.  He finally said he was embellishing.  Took the bandage off.  Opie, there was not even a ding.  There wasn't a scratch where if you scratched yourself on your head because you had an itch,  there wasn't even that red that you had.  I have more of a mark on my face, if you've probably noticed today, from a washcloth because 
[01:40:00]  I scrubbed too hard.  Look.  Over here.  Right.  He doesn't even have that on his forehead.  You get more marks just from shaving than he has.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't stress to how much of a mark there was nothing.  Nothing.  And then the eye patch comes off.  He was blinking real hard with that eye, saying that there was glass in it, even though there  wasn't glass.  But the eye started loosening up, and he's not bright.  And he pulled down the bottom of the eye, and there was no red at all. 
[01:40:30]  No red in the eye.  So, obviously...  So it went from a major car accident to...  He made up the story because he missed Monday and Wednesday, and now no one wants to leave  the studio to work.  It was a story.  Let's go back to Anne-Marie.  Anne-Marie.  Yes.  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Well, I could tell you that Brian probably, when he gets hurt, see what happens is he's  kind of afraid that it's going to be worse than it really is. 
[01:41:00]  Anne-Marie, he wasn't hurt at all.  Oh, but I bet you he thinks he was.  I wouldn't put it past him.  I bet you he poked himself in the eye a couple times before he came to work.  No, he didn't do it on purpose.  But he gets, like...  He's very tender.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, if he gets, like, a headache, you know, he's got a brain tumor.  Oh, like a hypochondria kind of thing?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  But that's...  Yeah, and we call him Brian the liar.  Oh, what do you call him? 
[01:41:30]  Brian the liar.  Well, because he exaggerates a lot?  A little bit, yeah.  Jesse?  Yeah.  Do you remember when he said he had to take a day off because he had surgery on his head  or his brain?  No, it was his...  What?  What?  Something like that.  It was his foot.  It was his foot?  Yeah.  He said his brain.  You're right.  He said he had surgery on his head.  Well, maybe his head is...  All right, let's go.  Get Brian...  Brian, what happened?  What happened when?  You had surgery.  On my ankle, yes.  On your ankle.  Yes, that was true. 
[01:42:00]  And that was true.  What happened?  Now nothing I'm going to say.  Well, now you know what it is.  It's the boy that cried wolf thing.  You can't blame us now for not believing certain things.  Earl...  You've set this...  Earl, stay in here.  Steve, stay in here.  Get stinky in here.  Now, what happened to your leg?  To your ankle?  From my leg, I tore a leg.  What happened?  I tore my leg.  I meant playing basketball.  Playing basketball.  And you got an operation done.  That's what looks like you're too active.  Do you have a scar on there?  Is there an operation scar there?  Yeah, on my knee, yeah.  All right, let's see.  He was playing basketball with Michael Jordan. 
[01:42:30]  Brian, you...  All right.  Brian, you told me it was when you tripped.  I thought you said ankle.  I thought you just said ankle.  Wait, I thought you just said ankle.  You said ankle.  I'm just...  All right.  I don't see any surgical scars.  Wait, where's the scar?  How long ago was this done?  My surgery scar was done a while ago.  But my knee...  But what's the recent one?  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Guys, when was this?  When was this?  This was like...  A couple weeks ago.  Do you remember when...  Remember when you guys made a quick comment that someone tripped over the door? 
[01:43:00]  He tripped over the...  Right.  Oh, that was...  Brian, I remember that.  And you said you came in and you said you had to have, like, your ankle...  You, like, tore a ligament.  I didn't tore a ligament from that.  I don't need to be writing you out.  You want to see my...  I'm not trying to write it out.  Where is the surgery scar that you had from this recent operation that was two weeks ago?  It was orthoscopic.  You're not familiar with the...  I swear.  Oh, no.  We have no surgery scars over here. 
[01:43:30]  Wait a minute.  It was orthoscopic.  So...  Okay.  What do you got?  It's a mole.  It's a mole.  It's a mole?  Oh, my God.  I can't believe it.  It's not a mole.  Okay.  Now, Brian, haven't you also been going to physical therapy every Friday?  Yes.  I have been.  For what?  My ankle.  For the ankle.  Yeah.  That you have the orthoscopic surgery. 
[01:44:00]  You have the mole on.  Yeah.  And this therapy is where?  It's in...  Peekstil.  Sorry.  Peekstil.  No, Peekstil.  And what do they do to help you out?  Put me on different machines.  Although I'm not very active, as Opie said, they put me on machines that make me...  On machines?  Yes.  Because your ankle...  What do they say is actually wrong?  Total ligaments.  Total ligaments?  Yes, a lot of them.  Okay.  So now you, like, walk and do things.  Treadmill or something?  Yeah.  Treadmill, like machines. 
[01:44:30]  Okay.  But there's no scar?  No.  There's no scar.  It's amazing.  It's new, sir.  All right.  Where's...  Bring Jesse in here.  We've got a lot of the show members here.  Pathological Brian's a new nickname.  Coming in from Mark from the Bronx.  Can Brian...  Can Brian say, yeah, that's the ticket?  This is groovy. 
[01:45:00]  Can't be seen us while I'm sad.  You said I was home and I know you can dance.  Don't tell me different.  No, it's a lie.  I'm feeling honest.  See how I cry.  Liar, liar by the castaways.  No, where's the other one?  Where's our buddy?  Yeah, give me the other one.  You didn't download that?  By the way, Napster still works like a charm.  Napster working like a charm.  We'll get into that discussion a little later. 
[01:45:30]  Get everyone in here.  Get Sticky in here.  So, okay, you have that surgery.  Yeah.  But it was nothing with your brain or your head?  What was that, Jess?  You said...  See, Ben, I don't remember exactly because it wasn't like a big deal,  but you said you couldn't come in one Friday.  I don't mean...  I feel bad because I'm like...  Oh, whatever.  It's cool.  You said you had like...  You needed surgery on your head.  On your head?  No, no.  That was Rick making a joke about me.  He said I needed a lobotomy.  No, no, no.  You said it to me that you had head surgery. 
[01:46:00]  I never said I had head surgery.  I was getting...  Rick said that.  Brian, Brian, when you make a joke, that means it's not real.  All right.  Well...  Oh, my goodness.  I missed work one day.  All right.  Here's the deal.  There's a lot of people very uncomfortable right now.  So we're going to have a little vote.  What are you going to vote?  I have ripped my ankle up.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Who wants Brian to go home today?  Yeah.  What?  I'm not voting that. 
[01:46:30]  You lied.  Why would face?  Who cares?  I'm fine with it.  I don't care.  I think it made for great radio.  What, you want to toss a diamond in the rough like this out the door?  No.  I said go home today.  Today?  Yeah.  No.  I think he's doing a great job.  Thank you, I think.  All right.  Come on.  You're going to get more stories if we live.  This is great.  If we live.  Hands up.  Who wants him out?  Today.  Today?  No.  I stay off with my handle, too.  Oh, you want to go home today?  Steve, take care of the eye. 
[01:47:00]  You're cool.  Well, you're big, and you don't know how to handle yourself.  I don't know.  He's not going to.  There's only three people that want him to leave?  Everyone's being honest.  Let's be honest.  Why don't we get out of the room?  I'm being honest.  I think it's fine.  I'll turn my back, and I'll put my hands against the wall for you guys.  All right.  Turn your back, because maybe someone doesn't want to see that they're voting.  Oh, a secret ballot?  All right.  Who wants him to leave?  Yeah, look.  Four votes are going up right now.  Four and four.  I had mine up before.  Just didn't see it. 
[01:47:30]  Earl, it's to you.  The deciding vote.  Earl, I like you.  I can't believe you guys wanted to stay today.  Why not?  I feel bad.  Screw feel bad.  I'm still an intern.  I don't want you to vote me out.  Kids, effed up. 
[01:48:00]  Why did you do it?  Can we ask that?  We really haven't asked the why.  Why did you go through this elaborate accident scheme?  Intimidation.  What do you mean?  Everyone had a story on the show, and you figured you needed one?  Yeah, sure.  No, I don't know.  What intimidation?  Wait.  You are intimidated?  I'm intimidated by the show.  You're intimidated.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Before we get into this?  Yeah.  Because it is a tie.  It's four that want him to go, four that want him to stay.  I'm telling you, we're going to the listeners.  I'm sorry. 
[01:48:30]  I'm screwed.  Clear the phone lines.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two, four.  Okay.  We've got nine phones ringing.  And that's what's going to decide it.  I still got to know.  Was there ever an accident?  Yes, there was.  Was it in the last calendar year?  Yes, there was.  See, now I can't even believe that.  I can't.  Now I can't believe.  It was an accident report.  I want you to go.  And I interrupted you.  Go ahead.  Say what you have to say.  You were saying you were getting...  Oh, you're intimidated by the show.  Yes.  Now, why is...  I'm sure anybody... 
[01:49:00]  Jess, when you first came here, it was a little rough, a little intimidating.  Yeah.  All right.  And how did you deal with it?  I'm still dealing with it.  What are you guys talking about?  But you just come in.  You do your job.  You hang out.  You get your barbs in where you can.  You kind of...  You mix it up with us.  No, like you just don't say any...  I would wait until you guys would talk to me.  And I didn't bring food.  Okay.  But that was a nice gesture.  That was a nice gesture.  But now, how did you feel this was going to help you? 
[01:49:30]  Because I felt like if I didn't come up with...  Because if I didn't elaborate on my injuries, that you guys wouldn't believe me, which...  Well, yeah.  You put you over the top there.  But why did you come up with the story at all?  It wasn't a story.  It really...  I mean, what?  But oh, it's a story.  You don't have stitches.  Okay.  That is a story.  But the accident was true.  Take the patch off your stupid eye.  Take the patch off.  God.  I'm not going to play along now.  Take the patch off.  My eye really does bother me. 
[01:50:00]  I really can't take off the patch.  His eye bothers him, Opie.  You guys are all insane.  Don't.  You know.  Cornea.  If you shine a light in the person's eye, it kills.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that, do you?  We're not shining a light in his eye, for Christ.  We're starting the voting.  Okay.  The listeners will decide.  I'm backing up as we speak.  Oh.  Dave.  Yeah.  Have you heard the last hour of radio?  Yeah.  Okay.  What do you think?  I think the guy's a pathological liar. 
[01:50:30]  You've got to get rid of him.  All right.  Get rid of him.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  Take care.  One bell.  Stinky.  Make sure Stinky keeps track.  Okay.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Mike.  I'm sorry, man.  This guy's crazy, but he's funny.  So, no.  That's what I'm saying.  All we want to know is should we, you know, send him home today, right now?  No.  No.  This is way entertaining, man.  I'm listening.  All right.  Stay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to another Mike.  Mike?  Keep him there, because two words. 
[01:51:00]  Ted Kaczynski.  Thank you, Mike.  Have you been known to be violent at any time?  Very sweet guy.  Very sweet.  And he's a liar.  That's what they said about Joel Rifkin.  No.  And so you don't have any aggression or anything?  You guys are insane.  Well, everyone says that.  One day I might just, you know, snap.  Oh, good.  Let's just keep him around.  You're insane, Anthony.  There's no gag anymore.  I can't believe you guys want him here after what we just heard.  Oh, wait.  Earl's raising his hand now. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, but it doesn't matter, because you were a pussy when we needed you.  So now the listener's going to decide.  Troy?  Yeah.  Hey.  He's the guy.  See, everybody.  F you all.  The sympathy vote, I love it.  F you all.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry.  Fire him.  He's a fairy.  Fire him?  Yeah, fairy.  He's a fairy.  Fire him.  All right.  Okay.  We're running out of votes here.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, now I know why my instant feedback's never getting on the air anymore. 
[01:52:00]  Fire his ass.  Fire his ass.  It's 3-3.  All right, guys.  Bye-bye.  Three votes to go.  Mark's on the Bronx saying,  he should have used the Chewbacca defense quickly.  That it's just so ridiculous that you must have quit.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Dom.  Hey.  I say keep him.  I think he's got a fast two on our hands.  F and you guys suck.  No, that was a keep.  Please, no, don't let him leave today.  It's only 5 o'clock.  That leaves in two hours to come back with weapons.  Michael.  Yeah.  Hey, what do you think? 
[01:52:30]  I think he should go.  All right.  He's like the guy at the ski lodge with the fake cast.  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.  It comes down to the one final vote.  Here it is.  Oh, I wish we had a drum roll.  Damn it.  Don't let me down.  Wayne?  Yeah, that's me.  All right.  How you doing, O.A.?  You will decide Brian's fate.  Fate.  Honestly, I know his doctor.  What?  That's where I vote.  What?  I know his doctor. 
[01:53:00]  You knew his doctor?  I know his doctor.  I can verify for it all.  Conflict of interest on the voting, but.  Oh, but it's Bones McCoy.  Bones McCoy.  We have to hold him and he'll do anything that's wrong with him before he comes into work.  All right.  Very funny.  You just saved your ass.  All right.  Wayne, it's.  I say keep the nut.  Keep the nut.  You know, maybe put one of those security bracelets on him so you know where he is all  the time.  Can I take off my patch now?  He stays.  Keep on your patch?  I mean, you got to talk about it, you know, go around. 
[01:53:30]  So now you're going to admit that the patch is fake and you want to take it off now?  That was a joke.  I'm sorry.  Wayne, thank you.  You let me down and I was going to give you something for voting him out.  You're going to give me something to vote him out?  No, now I can't.  You voted to keep him.  Brian, I'd appreciate it if you didn't look me in the eye or even don't even come 20 feet  away from it.  Don't even enter the studio for the rest of the show.  Okay.  Just the show? 
[01:54:00]  Okay.  I can do that.  And do not be in the office after the show's over.  Uh-oh.  Until I leave for the train.  It's like Michael Corleone in Fredo.  You're not to look at me.  You're dead to me.  Wow.  I'm going to slowly back out of the studio.  This is, uh, you guys let me down, man.  What's the matter, Ope?  You don't like that?  You're saying you love the psycho factor.  Every time something happens, you go, I love the psycho factor.  We just got an hour of psycho factor.  Now it's like hit the street. 
[01:54:30]  Oh.  What?  There he comes.  What?  You don't find this very entertaining on a very psychotic level?  You don't have to deal with them.  Look at these guys.  Look at Sticky and Jess.  They don't even want to go outside the studio now.  We're never going to talk to them again.  You're the talent, guys.  You know?  We're not the talent.  No, the problem is it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I wanted them to go and I wanted them to stay.  Then we went to all you guys. 
[01:55:00]  It was four and four.  Then we go to the listeners.  And the listeners let us down.  Or my side, anyway.  Ben, are you happy?  No, this sucks.  Get him out.  You're a friggin' freak.  Thank you.  That is mental.  That whole story we just heard is beyond psycho factor.  That's mental.  All right.  Send him home for the day.  We can't.  And then we will talk about it.  No, we can't.  Why?  We did it the fair way.  Oh, I know we did it the fair way. 
[01:55:30]  I'll accept the results.  I'm just pissed.  I'm pissed at the results.  But I'll accept them.  What?  What?  Let's see.  There's a poll right now.  People want to vote.  Well, the voting should be whether he should be fired or not.  What about kill sauce?  We don't need good radio that bad is all I'm going to say.  Make him wear the patch as long as he still works there, no matter how long it is.  Like, he's always got to come in now with that patch. 
[01:56:00]  If he doesn't, he goes home.  Yeah, tell him that.  No, I'm serious.  He's got to wear the patch always.  No, the day he shows up without the patch, I swear to God, you've got to send him right home.  No joke.  Rick, go tell him.  No, that's got to come from Rick.  Rick hired the lunatic.  Very good.  Michael from Tenton Falls.  He said that.  All right, we're really late, so let's take a break.  Also, Eftar from Newark had the same idea.  Like it or not, this will be the most popular radio show in New York City. 
[01:56:30]  The ONA show beats the hell out of my dad's old pornos.  Yeah, it's the ONA show, 212-757-1027.  Let's talk to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I just wanted to say you guys got the right idea.  You make Bumble the Boy Wonder wear the eye patch all day long.  If he doesn't have any depth perception, it'll be harder for him to plunge a knife into your chest.  Or probably into your back.  Thank you, Mike.  Very good.  You know, you've got to get sticky in here. 
[01:57:00]  I'm proud of Stink.  He's becoming more and more honest as he continues working on our radio show.  He would think he was a little...  What, shy?  Shy at first.  Wouldn't really speak his mind, but he has changed.  Stink, one of our favorite smartasses back in the office after the show, Stink.  Stink, what are you feeling right now with this kid?  I hate him.  I don't want to see him.  Oh, wow.  He lied to me like constantly the whole day before the show. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  I was asking him, you know, what happened.  Oh, I got stitches.  I can't show them.  My eyes got glass in it.  But, you know, what am I going to do?  A little scary.  And you're a little, like, uncomfortable now.  Yeah.  I don't want to talk to him.  See, you guys are like, I'm uncomfortable.  Yeah, you've got to be a little sympathetic.  I mean, there's a reason that he's doing this.  You know, I'm not out here to save the world and stuff, but I kind of know there's some  kind of reason that it's going on. 
[01:58:00]  Anthony.  Yeah.  There was a reason why Joel Rifkin did what he did.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm saying I'm not getting behind him.  There was a reason why that kid shot up the school in San Diego.  Absolutely.  And it was because when he lied one time or something, people just jumped on him, maybe.  Yeah.  Tony, what's up?  Oh, before you start ripping on me, I agree you should have sent him home today.  I tried.  But, dude, this kid has got problems, bro. 
[01:58:30]  And, dude, we've listened to your stories about your family.  Yeah.  Dude, my friend's pregnant wife works with your brother, Quinn.  You think after hearing Friday's show, she didn't look at him in a different way?  Wait a minute.  First of all, first of all.  Dude, I agree, bro.  I've never faked an injury.  I know you have.  No one in my family faked an injury for sympathy.  All right?  Bro, nobody's questioning your integrity, bro.  But this kid has got problems. 
[01:59:00]  He needs a nap scheme.  Maybe a permanent one.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  Not you, Ope, the kid.  Oh, I heard you.  Dude, man, I don't know, Ope.  Nice knowing you, bro.  Oh, this kid's going to whack you in, stinky first.  Jeez.  Man, I tried to warn you with the pizzas, bro, because I got whacked, too, on that game.  Your own guy sent you pizzas.  I got a box of...  They sent me a pizza box with a bunch of crushed tomatoes in it.  Next day, I got whacked.  Ope, you're crazy, Ope.  Boy, this kid's probably scared-ass-less of you anyway, bro. 
[01:59:30]  Who cares?  Keep him away from me.  And Rick could crack him like a Walmart.  Later, dude.  All right, Tony.  Nice knowing you, brother.  Tuttle from New York.  Final test.  Does Brian like Huey Lewis and the news?  Look at my business card.  The color is bone.  Rob, what's going on?  Yo, fire his dumb ass.  You're calling Stinky a rat, though?  No, because I thought the kid was answering the phone.  Oh.  Dude, Stinky rocks, man.  Stinky rolls.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  They can make him a Stinky's personal bitch.  All right.  They can do stupid things.  All right.  All right, guys.  Thank you, Rob.  All right.  Look, Steve, you're all uncomfortable.  No, this isn't going to work.  He's got to go home today.  Oh, because...  No, because it's like Michael...  Here, Michael...  Now you're all uncomfortable.  Michael on line two.  Ope, change your diaper.  Opie.  Yeah.  What's your problem?  We're a grown man.  We're not...  Because the kid is effed up.  Opie.  Not even in a good way.  Not even in a way we could, like, exploit on the radio.  Who cares? 
[02:00:30]  You can take him down, all right?  I saw you on XFL.  I mean, you're not some little small wimp.  Who cares?  He's not going to want to shoot me, buddy.  He doesn't know how to bandage himself.  So what?  See, now Ian wants to send him home.  But you know what?  Man, stick to your words.  Keep him.  He's entertaining.  I'm just saying, if it's going to interfere with the show, then he's got to go home.  No, see, I'm not happy with the decision we made, but we made the decision.  I have to live with that.  That's fine.  Yeah, but you're crying about it.  Who cares?  Michael.  Keep him away.  Michael, you...  Stinky! 
[02:01:00]  God, someone will back me up.  Stinky, talk to Michael.  Everyone is uncomfortable now.  How are you going to look at this guy or, like, at the end of the show, go to the office  and sit down next to him?  What is he going to say to you?  Michael, the guy had a bandage on his forehead claiming he had three stitches.  After about an hour, he finally took the bandage off.  Guess what?  There wasn't even a scratch.  Isn't that a little mental?  Does he have a Jeffrey Dahmer look to him or what?  At least out of one eye, did you see it?  I mean, come on.  You're sitting here whining about this for 20 minutes. 
[02:01:30]  Move on.  All right, we'll move on.  Thank you.  Okay.  Hey, guys, work on the chick show.  I heard that dude telling tales all throughout the halls today about his accident.  See, that's what he was doing.  He was telling everyone.  If I was him, I would leave on my own, out of embarrassment.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's just sitting there now.  I know. 
[02:02:00]  He's just sitting there.  No one's talking to him.  He's afraid to come by the studio door, even.  Hey, tell him to go home.  What?  Tell him to go home.  Oh, you're not going to make me do that.  Oh, I will.  But then the listeners will lash out at me.  Call me a crybaby.  It comes from you.  They'll go, okay, cool.  Tell him to go home.  Mm-hmm.  Tell him to go home.  You can hear this outside.  I know.  I'm not going to tell him to go home.  Why would I tell him to go home? 
[02:02:30]  Tell him to go home.  Ben and I will laugh so hard.  I will die.  We will die.  See, if it comes from me, then I'm a puss and all that, blah, blah, blah.  I can respect that.  But if it comes from you, man, Ben and I will fall on the floor laughing.  Come on.  Tell him to go home.  You want him to go home?  Yes.  I can't do that.  Come on.  What am I?  Tell him to go home.  Tell him to go home and not to go back. 
[02:03:00]  Get out of here.  Come on.  That's not my job.  I don't hire and fire.  Well, that's Rick's job.  Rick should show some backbone.  Oh, see?  Come on.  You're pushing it off onto me?  Well, who's who's, uh...  Hey, the name on the sign says Opie and Anthony, and you're Anthony.  Look.  Yeah, his name's first.  Look.  Oh, you're going to pull that.  That's the first time you ever pulled out.  Well, in this situation, it works. 
[02:03:30]  Just for the record, we've never played that before.  It works, though, in this situation.  Yeah, but you know we've never played that before.  Look, I already spelt out how I feel about this.  Look, if I'm not looked at as a crybaby, I'll do it right now.  No problem.  I'm not saying anything.  What are you thinking?  Send him home.  What are you going to do anyway?  He can't do anything now.  He just has to sit there. 
[02:04:00]  You know what?  I don't really care what people say to me.  Get him in here.  What?  What?  Yeah, make sure he doesn't go in the studio.  You're going to have to get help.  Brian?  Yeah?  You're outside the studio about what?  I'm at least 20 feet from you.  Right.  That's what I asked you.  So, for the first time, you're following rules.  The opiate restraining order.  Can we do the prison visit, though? 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, you want to do it that way?  Yeah, get him on the phone.  All right.  No, because then, no.  No, I can do it this way.  Brian, you're making a lot of people uncomfortable.  I can tell.  I'll leave if you want me to.  That's okay.  I understand.  What?  What?  I understand.  You understand that?  Yeah.  We don't know if we want you back, though.  What?  Are you going to lie?  That would suck. 
[02:05:00]  Well.  Do you understand?  There has been a breach of faith here.  Don't you find it a little weird, the whole thing?  You're still wearing the patch, and you don't even have an eye injury.  You don't have an injury, though.  That's what you don't understand.  It's very injury.  You said you had an injury on your forehead.  There's not even a scratch.  My head was smashed apart, and I lost my shoes.  Jess.  Oh, he's holding the mic?  Yeah.  On the other side.  So, uh, well, what, Opie?  You're about 19 feet away. 
[02:05:30]  Okay.  Yeah, move back a foot.  Thank you.  God damn it.  You're awful.  I'm so mean.  I'm mean.  The guy's...  Shut up.  No, I see what you're...  Shut up, Jess.  I don't pound it, Jess.  Opie, you're 100% right.  Stink, am I right?  You are.  Ben, am I right?  100%.  Thank you.  200%.  You're not going to ask me?  I don't care.  I know you don't care.  That's all right.  These are good cookies. 
[02:06:00]  Who wants them to come back?  Not everyone at once.  Wow.  That hurts.  How's it going to be different any day, you know, tomorrow?  It's awkward.  Yeah, you're calling...  Is the injury going to be healed?  You're calling sick half the time anyway.  Is this going to crush you?  Not that much, but it will.  A little bit, because I like you guys.  Oh.  You can tell me.  I'm here.  Oh.  I mean... 
[02:06:30]  Be tough, be tough.  I'm talking to myself.  Would we have to worry about you coming back here and shooting everybody?  I don't like being blunt with this thing.  Now, is there anything that might happen?  Are you going to shoot everyone?  No, no, no.  No shooting going on.  Stab?  No.  You can still listen to us through the radio and stuff.  And you can visit on, like, Psycho Day.  Bring your favorite psycho to work day. 
[02:07:00]  Let's see how things go.  Oh, you're such a push.  You can step back a little bit.  Hello.  I think he sounds fine to me.  I don't foresee any problems with him coming back.  Should we put him on the Zoloft?  Yeah, can we put him on the Zoloft?  Keep from killing y'all?  You were going to put him on the Zoloft.  Y'all being us.  So, Brian, why don't you...  You're not going to kill anybody, though, right? 
[02:07:30]  No, nobody's going to be dead.  All right, no threats, no threatening emails or anything?  Nothing at all.  What?  Nothing at all.  Nothing at all.  Did you sign something?  Yeah.  When you started working here?  Yeah.  Okay.  That you're not to kill anybody?  Yeah, I didn't read the fine print, but I guess...  I think that was in there.  Brian, I'd feel safer if you weren't around.  Wow.  Heavy duty.  Stay.  Yeah, me too.  You know, it comes from this breach in faith. 
[02:08:00]  We all trust each other here, and we don't lie to each other.  And then when a lie is made like that, we're like, hey, where does it end?  You know what I mean?  Okay.  Oh, I'm the guy.  You just made me the guy.  I just said that.  I've gotten that speech before.  Oh, no, you be the guy.  We're going to go back to my cookies.  And beer.  Hang out.  Cookies and beer.  I'm fine.  We'll leave, like, the door, like, a jar.  I've gotten that old gag, too.  We'll leave the door a jar. 
[02:08:30]  All right, we'll revisit this.  You're not fired.  You're on what we call a permanent layoff.  Oh, I've been laid off.  All right, Rick, why don't you show Brian the door?  Oh.  What?  Jess?  That's terrible.  No, you guys are right, the more I think about it.  He's all right?  No, you guys are right, the more I think about it.  Why?  What were you thinking before, Andrew?  I just felt like it was, like, mean.  Yeah.  I mean, I...  See, I'm so bad, but I mean...  Look, that's kind of elaborate, just to...  Yeah, but we don't...  No, you're right. 
[02:09:00]  And I don't have to...  We don't work with him.  It's someone like Stink.  I can see it in his face.  He's not happy.  Ben's not happy.  You're not happy.  I'm not happy.  Rick's not happy.  Yeah, I see.  That's what I mean.  I see the...  You don't have enough brain cells to figure out that the guy's a psychopath.  Right.  You're working with him thinking everything's fine.  Brian, any final thoughts?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Hey, you want to make a statement? 
[02:09:30]  It's been real.  Oh.  All right.  Sure.  Do you feel...  Sure.  It's been alleged.  Do you feel that...  For me, it's been real.  Do you feel this is justified?  Somewhat.  If I brought in the police report, would you guys still think I'm BS?  Oh.  Well, I have a problem with the stitches that weren't there.  Yeah, even if you were in some kind of an accident, like the stitches not being there 
[02:10:00]  is a little weird.  Okay.  Not only that, if you really had an accident, then fine.  Call us and say you had an accident.  But don't not call us or call other people in this building and then show up the next  day that you're supposed to be here to work with an eye patch, a captain's hook hand,  a freaking bandage on your head.  A parrot.  I'm surprised you didn't wipe off your own leg just so you can limp in here, Christ's sake.  I told him not to do that.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Brian, so thank you.  Well, you know something.  What?  Send him home today. 
[02:10:30]  And then let's really discuss this because, you know, you know what it is.  Come on.  Have a little, you know, compassion.  I have compassion.  I just, I feel bad somewhere inside.  How old the guy are you?  20.  He's 20.  He didn't F up.  Tell a few wacky stories when you were 20.  But I F'd up so many times and Rick's been a lot cooler than that.  I don't know.  You didn't come in with a fake injury.  That's what I mean.  I'm on your side.  I'm saying.  A fake injury is weird.  Rick's need to go to when you screw up. 
[02:11:00]  Single white female territory.  It's weird if I could figure out why you did it.  I really still don't understand why you would do it.  Is there some kind of an issue you got?  Are there other issues?  It's hard to scream across the studio,  but it's a matter of being really afraid of you guys and being intimidated.  Well, but what is that?  I don't understand what the patch does.  So you had to talk it up?  Yeah.  You're 19 feet away.  Is it an attention thing?  No. 
[02:11:30]  You don't crave attention?  No.  Maybe?  No?  Dude, you look ridiculous.  You're standing there with an eye patch that you probably don't need.  Oh, probably.  He's warming up to you.  You are saying it was a definite lie.  Well, I'm being polite.  That's nice to you.  Oh.  All right.  We've got to move on with the show.  Okay.  So, look.  You go home for the rest of the day because he can't think under these circumstances. 
[02:12:00]  And then we'll get back to you on the long term of this.  But have that police report ready.  I'd like to see it.  Wrong.  Try again.  I'd like to see it before any decision is made.  And maybe a report from the hospital or the doctor that said that eye is a little amiss.  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Because if the eye is wrong and there is an accident report, the only thing he's guilty  of is covering up nothing on his head.  So, let's see.  It's kind of a glass company you went to. 
[02:12:30]  Let's see.  In that car.  No.  I want to see the accident report from the cops and the hospital thing that you got in the  emergency room and what the doctor said.  Will you guys, you know.  No, there's no promises being made here.  That's for sure.  I just want to see it.  All right.  That's all.  And it's just letting you off the hook lightly.  No, I'm not.  I'm really interested to see if I'm out.  You'll get the phone call tomorrow.  Oh, man.  You'll get the accident.  Oh.  Thanks.  I don't care.  I want to see it.  That's all.  All right, Rick.  Thank you, Brian. 
[02:13:00]  Thanks.  Thank you, Brian, for your service to this fine radio show.  And thanks for the hour of great radio today.  All right.  It'll be a best of.  We use you for good radio.  It'll be a best of, too.  All right.  So, it'll go on forever.  There they go.  Get that thing together, though, because I want to see that.  Okay.  There they go.  Rick, and there they go.  Stink, why don't you follow Rick to make sure nothing happens?  Let's take a break, regroup, and do something different.  You've got all the tact of a rake. 
[02:13:30]  That's all good.  I haven't fired anyone in a while. 
[02:14:00]  It's been a couple weeks, right, Ben?  They're horrible.  I'm not horrible.  I know that's how it's going to come across, but I'm telling you, everyone is behind me.  Steve, what's going on?  Nothing, man.  You guys should let them go.  Let them be, man.  Without a doubt.  You guys have never been 20 years old and messed up before and wished one of your bosses would give you a chance? 
[02:14:30]  That's what I was saying.  Let them be, man.  Yeah, he's only 20.  He made a mistake.  So what?  His mom didn't hug him enough, and he's got to feel like he needs approval from everybody.  It's all right.  That's a little weird, because you know what?  What?  I don't know.  We're like a fraternity around here.  It's kind of weird that one of the guys that is hanging out on a daily basis is coming in with fake injuries for sympathy from guys.  So the only thing he's guilty of is wanting your approval? 
[02:15:00]  What?  Wanting you guys to like him?  Let's just hang out.  Well, my voice is getting high now.  Let's just hang out.  I know.  I think it stinks, man.  He's 20 years old.  You guys are, you know, much older and much cooler, because you know...  Well, you know what you do.  What?  You take it with you, and you learn from it.  And better you're young when you're learning from it.  What do you want me to say?  Well, I don't know, man.  I think you guys are being harsh on him.  I'd love to sit there and counsel with him for hours on end, but I think I'm busy playing video games. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, yeah.  So maybe somebody else can.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  All right.  Take care, guys.  What are we running here?  A psychiatric center?  I wasn't happy from...  It's a dopey radio.  I have to say it.  I wasn't happy from the start.  There's been a lot of weird little things.  Today was the grand finale.  Who comes in to work with an eye patch?  Captain Hook.  Scott.  Yo.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I think that he, you know, is probably going to go home and end up seeing everybody he knows  and swinging from a rope somewhere.  I think you pushed him over the edge by letting him go. 
[02:16:00]  I hear he's on his way over to a children's.  He's going to go to a cancer hospital to take pictures of him giving them pies.  Trying to get his job.  Thank you, Scott.  All right, guys.  All right.  Bill, what's up?  Yo, guys, man.  I will let him go.  After what Rick did to you guys, you call yourselves a fraternity, you guys don't turn on each other?  What he did with Jay Moore and those guys from that...  They lied to you about that fight?  Hey.  And he's ragging this kid?  Bill?  Yes.  Let it be known. 
[02:16:30]  We take care of our own.  We took care of that problem.  Even Rick will admit that at this point.  I don't know why he's ragging on that.  I mean, the kid's only 20 years old.  That's old business.  Well, you're talking like that never happens.  You remember all the stories?  Rick got so pissed off at us getting back at him that he ripped off a door in the bathroom.  That's because he's just a psycho.  All right.  We take care of our own.  I give the kid a break.  He's only 20.  All right, Bill.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, that's what it is, you know. 
[02:17:00]  He's just a kid.  James, what's up?  I laughed up.  Hey, Anthony, try some horny goat weed, man.  Maybe you can grow some testicles again.  What do you mean?  You are one stop away from the feet of the floor.  Screaming, don't kill me.  I'm the good one.  What are you talking about?  You were backing up, man.  The guy was dead.  He backed into the corner, and you were begging for your life, practically.  What show were you listening to?  You should have just pulled the plug, and the guy, like Opie said, fired him, threw him  out the door, and moved him on.  All right. 
[02:17:30]  And then he went into the back office to collect his stuff, and Rick said it was a little weird.  Why was it weird?  What was weird?  It was weird because he said he needed to go into the office to get his stuff.  I said, do you need to get into the office to get your stuff?  He's like, yeah, I got some stuff down there.  It was like two pages from USA Today.  Uh-huh.  That was like...  So basically, he didn't have any stuff.  He didn't really have any stuff to get.  You know, it was just like... 
[02:18:00]  I'm looking at him, like, what the F is this kid doing?  This just in.  He just got a job interning at the Fox News Channel.  Back, back, back.  Mitch, what's up?  You know, this is the strangest thing I have ever heard in my life.  Why?  Dude, think about in the real world.  If you go into your job and you, like, walk around with a fake cast on or whatever because  you want attention...  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the point everyone is just letting, you know, they're all forgetting about that. 
[02:18:30]  The kid showed up with an eye patch and a huge bandage on his forehead because he was  in this horrible accident.  Turns out, we talked him into taking the bandage off.  There was nothing there, not even a scratch.  That is...  That's freaky weird, man.  That's psychiatry.  Everybody thinks he's wearing the patch and the bandage for attention.  No, he was using it as props to support his case that he was in an accident.  That's not a need for...  That's not starving for attention.  Attention is if you're walking around, like, clutching at somebody.  You don't think it's attention also? 
[02:19:00]  Well, it's definitely attention.  It's definitely attention.  It's definitely attention, but there's, like, deeper issues there.  Dude, this scene.  Because the fact of the matter is, you know, maybe when he was a kid, his parents didn't  believe him about anything.  Yeah, yeah, fine.  That's what we're getting at here, but we're not a psychiatric of work.  Yeah, we're not.  We're trying to do a radio show.  He's distracted us to the point, this is all we're talking about now.  Exactly, and that's why you don't need him there anymore.  Well, the only reason, we didn't have anything else planned, so we're milking it for all.  It's worth it.  Well, yeah.  Thank you, Mitch.  All right, man.  Ben, to you.  Hold on.  He's just been starving for airtime since day one, and that's... 
[02:19:30]  Well, he got his airtime.  Oh, that's good.  That's going out with a bang.  Can you...  Picture this scene, though, dude.  Picture this scene, if you will.  He's standing in front of the mirror with the patch going, where do I put it?  Thank you.  Wait, wait.  Thank you.  Thank you.  No, I'm just getting into the whole details of it.  I'm going to put it here over the patch.  Put it on my temple.  Where do I put it?  Thank you.  You don't find that weird?  Like Morton Downey Jr. with the swastik on his head.  Right. 
[02:20:00]  What do I do with this?  All the sexuals beat me up.  Didn't he write something, too?  No, he put a swastik on his head, but he spelled it backwards.  It was bad.  He wrote it backwards.  I thought he wrote something as well.  Someone maybe can help us, but it was...  Cut his hair off.  But it was backwards, because when he was writing it on his own forehead, he was looking  in a mirror.  I went in the bathroom and was accosted by...  Like, yo, you did not.  You did it yourself.  Okay, I did it myself.  Step up to the big mouth.  Well, everyone's split up.  Dennis, what's up? 
[02:20:30]  On this.  Dennis.  I wanted to call and beg and plead for the life of pathetic, poor little Brian.  I've been friends with his older brother for years, man, and he's a pretty delicate kid.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, you love him.  Hello?  Hey.  I mean, you guys have been like his idols ever since you guys came to New York.  And this was like the greatest thing that ever happened to this kid, you know?  And you fire him now, and like, I don't know, man.  He's, you know, he's a good kid, you know what I mean?  Plus, I think he's going to go eat small animals now.  You're firing him, so...  See, how much longer did he have in his internship here? 
[02:21:00]  About a month and a half, man.  About a month and a half?  Maybe.  So he only had a month and a half left?  I don't know.  You know, a month and a half too long.  Ah, screw it, then.  You know what?  At least he went out with a bang, you know what I mean?  Yeah, he could be proud of his segment.  That was a great segment.  He landed himself a best of, if nothing else.  That segment will be played ten times.  All right, man, I tried.  Put the scout on hold for a second.  All right.  Put him on hold.  Why?  I'm going to ask him something.  You're going to ask him something?  Why?  Do you think it's Brian? 
[02:21:30]  I'm telling you, the more we delve into this, it gets stranger and stranger.  Oh, God.  And, all right, can we move on with the show today?  Yeah, I guess so.  Moving on, though, can we back up?  You want to back up?  I've got to back up to the Drudge Jr. guy.  Oh, okay.  He's, this is a 13-year-old kid.  Go ahead, sorry. 
[02:22:00]  He prides himself on being like Matt Drudge, the internet reporter.  He reported, Opie, that you and I, this guy, Drudge Jr., a 13-year-old kid,  reported.  Well, if Drudge Jr. is listening, please call in.  Yeah.  He reported that we, you and I, are going to L.A. to do a radio show out there for Comedy  World internet radio thing.  Yeah, we'll just leave a huge broadcasting company to go do an internet. 
[02:22:30]  You know who does internet radio?  People that can't do real radio anymore or just couldn't do it in the first place.  You know who does internet radio?  All the jocks that got fired when we got here.  Right.  You know, all the jocks.  No, seriously, that's the only place that'll hire them.  You go to click radio.  And let me tell you something else about internet radio is about to collapse.  Yeah.  It just ain't working.  It is not panning out.  It isn't working.  And this kid claims that we're going over there and he has sources.  So we spoke to them earlier.  He called up. 
[02:23:00]  So cute.  A little kid with a little radio thing, internet drudge thing that he's doing.  And we set him straight.  Oh, so I thought.  Well, now he's writing this.  I know there was some confusion about my motivations on writing about the guys.  Here's some things I want you to understand.  I figure my sources provided me with inside information would be truthful because they had in the past is what he's getting at.  One source.  Now, this is no.  One source in Infinity Broadcasting. 
[02:23:30]  I heard information on Opie and Anthony asking for a greater contract than one of the stars of Infinity Broadcasting.  That are getting a lot, a lot of money.  Very popular morning show guy that just signed for millions of dollars.  And this kid, Drudge Jr., is now saying, we asked for more than that.  We asked for more than.  Or we would go somewhere else.  Right.  That is now what his insider is reporting.  And an insider at Comedy World, this internet radio thing, who has also given him good info, confirmed that Anthony, not Opie, had talked to the station's CEO about signing there. 
[02:24:00]  Opie, I got to fess up to you now.  I'm leaving the Opie and Anthony show.  Thank God, because I've had enough.  It's getting so popular and we're doing so well that I'm going to go to an internet radio station out in L.A.  Talk to the CEO about signing there.  Another clue developed when the midday show at Comedy World was canned. 
[02:24:30]  That made me believe the transfer was imminent.  It was finally all confirmed when Matt Drudge said O and A were moving.  Moving, not syndicating.  Moving to L.A.  I put the pieces together.  Go back to puzzles.  I put the pieces together.  I was ready to write my story, but Anthony himself claimed it was untrue, giving some lame-ass excuse.  You little mother F.  He had pubes.  I'd kick you in him.  I think he's covering something up, but I can't prove it. 
[02:25:00]  I can't prove it.  He's like a little friggin' Jimmy Olsen.  I want to smack this kid in the head.  Well, he's got to call the show again.  Dude, lame-ass excuse.  All I said was Opie and I are going to leave, or I'm going to leave now, Infinity Broadcasting,  one of the biggest broadcasting companies, to go to an internet radio.  Would we leave Infinity?  Hey, maybe another company.  Come along, but it sure as hell ain't an internet radio station.  Two and a half months to go. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, exactly.  What?  Opie, I'm talking with the CEO of Comedy World Internet Radio.  See, I was fooled.  I was fooled.  I thought Opie was the only one doing the high-ass.  No, I am so...  In between playing...  Drudge Jr.  Unreal.  Okay.  Drudge Jr.  You misunderstood me.  You effing little tool.  You're 13.  What are you doing?  Dude, what is it?  My lame-ass excuse.  You wrote Anthony's lame-ass excuse.  Opie and Anthony, but the guy told me... 
[02:26:00]  Can you do it as Drudge?  Yeah.  That is some stupid voice that got some...  All right, just do your Drudge impression.  It was a mixture from the Drudge voice and Joe Jr. from Ron and Anthony.  Just some stupid voice that I did.  Well, let's hear the voice.  Let's hear the voice.  Huh?  This is Drudge Jr.  I have some integrity here.  Integrity?  You're just writing lies. 
[02:26:30]  You're writing outright lies.  You're not writing lies.  You're writing lies.  I know you're not going to leave open hands.  It's just that...  Wait, can I tell you something, Drudge Jr.?  A 13-year-old kid should not have integrity.  Yeah, right.  Screw the integrity.  Listen to me.  I should.  Your source that is telling you this is a bad source.  He's giving you bad information.  I'm just fine.  I believe you, okay?  You have the guy you're talking about here right now on the phone.  I am telling you, I'm not a source.  I'm the guy.  I am telling you, I have never heard of Comedy World, never talked to a CEO. 
[02:27:00]  I believe you, all right?  Well, why did you write lame-ass excuses?  It's not just an internet radio station.  How long are you?  I'm not a kid, Norton.  It's in a lot of different cities, a lot of small market cities.  Okay.  It made sense that they'd sign you for a lot of money because then they'd get all kinds  of publicity and more people would listen.  Listen where?  It's in a few cities.  It's in L.A. and Syracuse and Houston. 
[02:27:30]  Don't you think Infinity Broadcasting has the power to put us in more markets than this  comedy world?  Yeah, but I put some pieces together and it starts to make sense.  Your pieces, your Reese's pieces you're putting together.  Reese's pieces, Ropey.  Judge Jr.  Yes.  There's no money in internet radio.  There's no money there.  Well, it's not just internet radio.  It's also, it's a real radio station.  Yeah, but it's cheese.  It's not like one of the top broadcasting.  Infinity Broadcasting is one of the top broadcasting companies. 
[02:28:00]  Well, they want to be.  Why leave?  New York, the number one market in the country.  Why would we want to leave?  You're not making sense.  You're telling people what your source is saying, but you've got to realize if you put  the pieces together, your source is a dick.  Oh, it kind of makes sense.  It doesn't make any sense.  Do you have a patch on your eye right now?  No.  Did your source have a patch?  You don't own the New York radio message board, do you? 
[02:28:30]  No, I've never been on it.  I can't even find it.  This is Alan Sniffen.  It's Alan Sniffen.  He's been a radio dentist.  He's been sucking in too much of the laughing gas.  Were you in a car that got hit by a motorcycle?  I think you have glass in your head.  Trudge Jr.  You know something?  If you were any older, I'd hate you.  But it's kind of cute that you've got this little site, and you're really trying to do 
[02:29:00]  this investigative journalism thing like Matt Trudge Sr.  But you've got to realize your sources, just because there are sources, it doesn't mean  that they're right.  Well, they gave me some pretty impressive information.  I'm Mr. X.  Yeah, they're going to take me away to the island with Patrick McGooan.  I love Mr. X.  Mr. X.  Did you see his picture real quick before the bag comes out of his head? 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  That was a great one.  He says he has pretty impressive what?  Information?  It's about when everybody was getting fired.  Yeah.  Some insider information about what was going on.  Oh, yeah?  And it was accurate?  Yeah.  All right.  Tell us what happened.  What did they say?  You can't say it on the air.  You can say what they said.  You just can't.  You don't divulge the source.  Uh-huh.  And then you were going to get fired about it.  Uh-huh.  Hey, look at that. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, look at that.  Is that right?  Wow.  Look at the time.  We've got to go.  Wow, you finally got something right.  All right.  You know something, though?  We went on the air and pretty much told that in as much detail as we could.  Right.  We talked about a meeting we were in, and that had nothing to do with anybody else having  problems at this station being fired and then rehired.  Well, he also said about how some producers were in trouble and they need to fire somebody. 
[02:30:30]  You know, they're just firing anybody they could find.  That's right, too.  Wow.  Thank you.  Pretty good.  You're batting a thousand.  You have better info than David Hinkley from the Daily News.  But this same source is the one that's telling you about this comedy world thing?  Yeah.  See, ask him.  No, I don't even want to know who it is, but you have contact with this guy?  Yeah.  Ask him where he got this from because Anthony is vehemently denying this.  It could be just some rumors going around the office or something. 
[02:31:00]  Or maybe you bumped into one of our bosses in the village.  What?  Y'all are kids talking to him.  Are you friends with Psycho Mark?  I don't think I want to be.  Perhaps he's the source.  All right.  Does source work here at NEW?  No.  All right.  Drudge Jr., very good.  Very good reporting.  Good job, Drudge Jr.  All right.  Now go back to the Opie Anthony message board and write how I give more lame excuses. 
[02:31:30]  See you soon.  All right.  Wait, is that your little line you use when you go away?  No, that's what Drudge always says.  Oh, okay.  God, you really love Matt Drudge.  And it's in the zeros.  All right.  It's in the zeros.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Bye-bye, Drudge.  Bye-bye.  All right.  It's hysterical.  The kid gets me all agitated.  He is Mr. X.  I love it.  Mr. X.  Mr. X.  Let's go to Chris. 
[02:32:00]  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  The kid might be on to something because, you know, if you hire Brian back, Opie's bolting  for the West Coast.  Pretty much.  Good job, buddy.  Let me talk into my mouth here.  Kill Flanders.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Opie, I've been trying to fire my babysitter.  I just don't have the heart to do it.  I need you to do it for me, man.  I'll do it right now?  I got to go home and get a number.  I'll call you back.  Please.  Opie's going to fire me.  How far from home are you? 
[02:32:30]  About 15 minutes.  See, let me tell you something.  I will break the bad news to anyone out there for you.  Please.  I've been trying to do it.  I don't have the heart to do it.  You got to do it.  Are you serious or are you just joking?  No, I'm serious.  All right.  When are you going to be home?  In about 20 minutes.  All right.  We'll do it before we get out of here.  Great.  I'll break the bad news for anyone.  Dude, she empties out my refrigerator.  She eats everything.  All right.  Call back.  Great.  I'll be back to you.  All right. 
[02:33:00]  I have no problem.  Jeez, you're awful.  That little bastard.  He's got me all riled.  I hate that.  Is it lies?  It's lies.  He probably had you whacked on mafia.  At least give me a better place to go to than internet radio.  That's what I'm so pissed about.  Say someone from Clear Channel's hiring me or something.  Oh.  My God.  Internet radio, Opie. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, click radio.  Ooh.  Me and Vin Skelsa got a show.  I think it's no secret that we only have two and a half months left on our contract.  Right.  Right.  And they want to keep us here at WNAW.  Hello, Judge Junior.  It's Donna McBavra.  I got another inside.  Anthony's losing half his money and half his power with the politicians.  What he has in his pockets like so many nickels and dimes. 
[02:34:00]  Don't we should tell everyone?  Go ahead, go ahead.  I hear you're signing for aluminum can and string radio.  No, it's taking off.  They string it from tree to tree in all the yards, and we listen to it in the tree board.  While I put the pieces together.  Puzzle pieces, pieces, pieces.  But I...  Pieces.  Judge Junior.  See you later.  See you next time.  Whatever the friggy said. 
[02:34:30]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Chucky Knuckles checking in?  Chucky Knuckles.  Anthony Udique.  Where's your loyalty?  You're going to do a show that will be in direct competition with Scorch in Syracuse?  It's Gorge, Internet Radio.  Revenue, Internet Clip Radio.  Reference of the day right there.  No, I want to tell everyone, yeah, we have two and a half months left on our contract.  We're in the middle of, like, negotiating, and they really want to keep us and stuff.  God, they're not impressing us at all. 
[02:35:00]  Right?  We should tell the story of what happened at Rick's gig on Friday.  Rick, member of the show, obviously, representing.  Tell everyone what happened on Friday.  Well, I had a beer night over in Staten Island at a bar.  I think it's called Neighbors.  And, you know, Earl was going to meet me there.  I went home, got my car to drive there.  So, you know, at the end of the night, I can just drive straight home.  Earl was supposed to show up at the van because he had all the prizes and everything. 
[02:35:30]  Well, get Earl.  Is Earl still here?  Yeah, he's somewhere.  Earl!  So, needless to say, I got there at about a quarter of 11.  Here comes Earl.  And Earl was already there.  But I'm like, hey, Earl, where'd you park the van?  Because when you do a beer night, not to bore everyone, you guys have been to a lot of radio events.  You show up at the venue, there's the van right in front.  Wow, pretty impressive.  Makes an impression. 
[02:36:00]  Usually they have, like, hot chicks, big boobs, handing out free stuff, right?  CDs, bumper stickers.  Making that impression for the radio show on the station.  We have never had that.  Instead, what did we have?  We had Earl.  Who was supposed to be driving the van.  Supposed to be driving the van.  No offense, Earl, that just flat out sucks.  I mean, we should have hot chicks.  You could be driving the hot chicks.  And they jump out and all giggly and stuff with their little, you know, shirts tied, you know, around their waist and stuff.  Hot shorts, you know, handing out the wow stickers because that's all we have to give away around here. 
[02:36:30]  But instead, it's just Earl in a beat-up van.  And what happened Friday?  And never got out the garage.  Never got out the garage.  Not the first time.  Not the first time this has happened.  Of course not.  What was wrong with the van?  The battery died.  How does the battery die?  There's a leak in the van, which we can never find.  And it just drained the battery.  The battery is supposed to die in like a 77 Chevy. 
[02:37:00]  Not a station vehicle.  Earl, why are you wearing an iPad, Earl?  And a bandage on your head.  You couldn't make it to the gig.  What happened?  Is the van wearing an iPad?  That's the truth.  Is the station van faking?  It's still in the garage.  Actually, the station van was hit by a motorcycle guy.  Right.  So, why don't you tell everyone how you got to the gig with all those fine prizes.  What did you have to give away, by the way?  Payboy CDs, some shirts.  Wow T-shirts. 
[02:37:30]  Wow T-shirts.  Okay.  And how did you get to the gig because the van was working?  I took a cab.  Cabbing it to the gigs.  Cabbing it.  Taking a cab.  Yeah.  A $50 cab ride.  $50?  And one way?  No, well what?  The first way it was like $45.  The coming back was like almost $70.  Earl?  I have to go on record and say you're lying like Brian.  Uh-oh.  You're lying like Brian.  That's a new saying.  In the hood. 
[02:38:00]  You're trying to tell me that a black man got in a cab.  What?  In midtown Manhattan.  Hey, let me tell me.  I got someone to drive him all the way to Staten Island.  No, let me re-freeze there.  No, let me re-freeze.  It took me 20 minutes to get a cab.  I swear to God.  Now it's making sense.  It took me 20 minutes.  A couple of guys, they just saw me, kept driving, and I said, hey, I got to go to Staten Island.  He goes, I'm not going to Staten Island.  And then I talked to the last guy in the truck.  He said, I'm not going to Staten Island.  With a black man. 
[02:38:30]  Well, that's how they are.  They don't pick up black guys.  That's just the way it is.  He said, I'm not going to Staten Island?  He goes, I really can't say that.  They're supposed to take you where the...  Ed.  You know that this radio station is like the laughing stock of the whole city?  Yes.  And they want us to re-side.  Yeah.  Like any other station.  They show up.  They take pride in their promotions.  The van's there.  They got a...  It's a big deal.  They got a staff of like four or five.  They got a promotional staff.  Usually the hot ladies. 
[02:39:00]  Because you want to make an impression.  Instead, Earl has to take a cab to an appearance.  And this isn't the first time it's happened.  No.  No.  And our promotion guy decided to take the week off because both of the bosses took it.  Oh, here we go.  Where is out by 4.30?  Out by five?  Three.  Out by five.  He never makes it to five. 
[02:39:30]  No.  Out by three.  Maybe Earl took Reverend Al's black sea cab.  Maybe.  My black sea cab.  Dan the man.  Hop in, Earl.  You're going to Staten Island.  Dan the man.  Our promotion director.  One of our big bosses is in where?  Australia?  Australia.  So Dan figured, you know, there's so much work that needs to be done here at WNAW,  I don't even have to show up at work. 
[02:40:00]  And we got Earl taking cabs with the prizes so we can give you guys stuff.  The little crap we have.  Yeah, the real garbage.  I learned today that the best ass of the day was Brian the intern.  Yeah, we were supposed to start the best ass contest and we kind of got thrown off track.  No, we didn't get thrown off track.  No one showed up.  Let's be honest with ourselves.  We got thrown off track.  No one showed up.  We really didn't pitch it.  Are we going to have a best ass contest or is that over? 
[02:40:30]  No, we're going to...  We do have a great trip, right?  Yeah.  Las Vegas?  Three days and two...  No, three nights in Vegas, yeah.  Three nights in Vegas.  Long weekend.  Ladies, you still have the rest of the week to show up and show us what you got.  Okay?  This is a good friggin' prize, you twats.  Get your asses in here.  I'm teasing, of course.  I'm Drudge Junior.  I'm all wound up.  Come on in here, girls.  Best ass contest.  Yeah, winner of the best ass contest will get their own professional photo shoot and 
[02:41:00]  could become the next Pinnacle Hornet Goatweed spokesperson.  Courtesy of Pinnacle Hornet Goatweed.  Sponsor the best ass contest.  Do the weed and you'll succeed.  Brian is in the lead at this point.  Just to give you an idea.  So, the contest is wide open.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  I used to do some promotional work in New York radio.  Yeah.  And, you know, it goes to all the stations, too, man.  You would imagine that, like, they got tons of money, these other stations, but they don't.  Right.  I've had vans break down on me.  I've had... 
[02:41:30]  I mean, I lost a tire on Garden State Parkway.  I almost got killed.  Jim, you're not going to convince me.  I've been doing radio half my life.  Man, I've been a little...  It's the same.  Any other station in this city, they have amazing vehicles.  Amazing.  More than one.  Yeah, we...  We have one that doesn't start anymore.  Yeah, we've had that, too, man.  I push vehicles in 90-degree weather.  Yeah.  It's a great promotion to the bottom end of the tone in New York radio.  Yeah.  Thank you.  It's no problem. 
[02:42:00]  Well, for how bad it is for all the other stations, it's ten times worse for us.  Right now, we're dying for a giant Pop-Tart in New York.  We would kill to broadcast next to a giant Pop-Tart and a yoo-hoo.  You guys will beg and plead.  You ain't going to get it, man.  Instead...  The way it goes.  By the way, this isn't Jim.  It's Ken Stevens.  Thank you, Ken.  Ah, that's funny.  My God.  Our promotion guy, I haven't seen him in a week. 
[02:42:30]  This place needs serious help.  The promotion job here at WRNAW is not the type of job where you could, like, just take a week off.  Right.  Because the bosses aren't around.  Everyone sneaks around when their bosses aren't around, you know.  Oh, the boss went home early, and I can get out of here a couple hours early.  No one will ever know the difference.  Right.  Can't do it for a week straight.  Can't be in any other offices watching TV.  What?  My God. 
[02:43:00]  I left out the best part about Friday night, though.  First face I see walking into the joint?  Mm-hmm.  Stalker Patty.  Nice.  Wonderful.  And?  And she was there the whole time.  Asked me for a ride home, and I had to turn her down.  See, you're a puss.  I am a puss, too.  I would have drove her home, and I would have went upstairs to see exactly how she lives.  What are you, insane?  We need that info here.  We've only imagined the last two years. 
[02:43:30]  Well, what if somebody sees me coming out of there?  What price to pay if somebody had a picture of you and Patty going into our house?  Oh, you'll never guess what I saw last night.  Rick and Patty going into the house and then coming out?  Oh, well.  Yeah, but just to see what that place was like.  Oh, believe me.  We could have gotten a police artist.  We could have sketched the apartment.  It would have been great.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, I got a buddy who used to be an intern for another radio station in the city. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  And they have two $50,000 Hummers that these guys drive around in.  Really?  And tour around all over the different, all the concerts and everything like that, handing out all kinds of crap.  Does this station have a morning show?  I don't know.  G100?  Yeah, do they have a morning show?  I think so.  Too bad.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Oh, damn. 
[02:44:30]  Oh, well.  There's a few others to choose from.  Let's take a break, Anthony, okay?  All righty.  What?  What?  What'd you say?  Nothing.  What's the problem?  Nothing.  212-757-1027.  We didn't talk about Napster.  We didn't talk about the child porn thing.  That's in the post today.  What's that one?  They didn't catch me.  What? 
[02:45:00]  Where is that one?  Here it is.  All right.  We'll get into that really fast.  So we'll play What Did We Learn Next.  Opie and Anthony.  We have our penises.  They do all of our speaking.  They do all the talking for us.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's beyond comedy.  It's beyond fiction.  It's fabulous.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W. 
[02:45:30]  Steve-O is becoming my favorite jackass.  He's a good one?  He's insane.  The guy...  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Oh, I didn't even know they were singing in this.  I saw that.  Is it in fire, man?  No, Bam is up there.  But Steve-O is starting to do some insane stuff.  We were talking last week about how he pierced his butt cheeks together.  Yeah, pretty sick.  Which was really sick.  You saw it over the weekend, right? 
[02:46:00]  Yes, I watched Jackass.  Steve-O went and got a waxing.  Got waxed.  Waxed his crotch and his nipples.  His chest hair.  And then his eyebrows.  Did you see how the eyebrows came right off?  They put that goop on.  They put this...  It looks like honey.  Real sticky, disgusting.  They smear it on his eyebrows.  And this is after he's just been in pain all over his body. 
[02:46:30]  Here's a reference from the past.  Was it Moujean?  Moujean.  Remember Moujean?  Moujean?  Where did Moujean go?  What?  They didn't like their advertising on our show?  What happened to the Moujean people?  So what?  He put all this...  She put this goop on his eyebrows.  And rubs the paper on it to stick it to it.  And then just against the grain, she pulls the paper off.  You just hear him scream.  I'm in pain thinking about it.  Imagine all your eyebrows at once are being pulled out of your head. 
[02:47:00]  The whole eyebrow went.  One fell.  In a second.  Gone.  And then he's standing there with one eyebrow.  In pain.  And then he shaved his whole head.  Yeah.  And everyone's laughing at him.  He looked like that character from...  What was that movie?  Powder?  Powder, yeah.  Right?  And then he decides to get on some stilts and then jump off a high diving board.  The kid is insane.  They had some funny ones.  Really good.  I love the antiquing. 
[02:47:30]  They were antiquing their friends.  Like they get all their buddies when they're asleep.  In hotel rooms and in their bedrooms.  And they come in with a camera and a big container of flour.  And they take a huge handful of flour and just throw it at the guy's face while he's leaving.  It's hysterical.  It goes...  And the guy gets all pissed off.  Call it antiquing because he'll look real old.  It's hysterical.  Hey, antique. 
[02:48:00]  Wham.  You know, just when you thought they can't come up with any more gags, they continue to surprise you and amaze you.  It's funny.  The show is still really, really good.  All right, Ant.  Why don't we play...  What did we learn on the show today?  Highly educational program today.  I'm going to go on the record and say I don't think we did anything today.  Look at all the stuff we were supposed to talk about.  Well, even though we didn't get to what we were supposed to talk about, I think it was quite educational.  All right.  Let's go to the phones.  Jason, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I learned the three biggest lies told me at NAWR, yeah, we have the best sales staff in the city. 
[02:48:30]  A black girl is not a virgin anymore.  And, guys, no, really.  Seriously.  It's not a...  It's three stitches.  I need a cut.  I need a bruise.  I mean, it's got something under my bandage.  It's a mole.  No, there wasn't even a mole.  The mole was on his knee where he had the orthoscopic surgery on his ankle that left no scar from two weeks ago.  Which was supposed to be, what, brain surgery, though?  Head surgery?  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  Thank you, Jason.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Woody, what's going on?  Isn't that terrible?  Your name's Brian, so they could call you Lion Brian, like his friends would call him Lion Brian.  If his name was like Tommy, hey, it's Lion Tom.  That doesn't sound good.  But Lion Brian is just too easy.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  I learned today that the XFL nickname for the scary intern would be He Scared Me.  He's scared me.  Hey, very good, buddy.  Later.  Thank you, Mike. 
[02:49:30]  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Today I learned a black girl's still waiting for the right guy.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, buddy.  Where am I going to put this bandage?  Put it on the...  That was all I was picturing was him in front of the mirror when he's going, and he has no injuries on his head.  He's got the bandage.  He pulled this part off.  Now it's sticky, and he goes, all right, where?  Here, a little closer to the front?  Where do I put it?  See, he went overboard.  He should have just had the patch. 
[02:50:00]  He would have been all right.  Dude, you fake a knee injury.  You put the ace bandage around your knee.  You walk with a limp for the day.  That's it.  And you make sure you don't start screwing up and limping on the wrong leg.  You don't fake head things, because then people can look and say, wait a minute.  What's under there?  Let me look.  If you got stitches, if you got stitches, I would say, dude, let me see.  Oh, yeah, and I would be like, check it out.  Whenever I was, especially in sheet metal work, everyone was always getting cut. 
[02:50:30]  It was like a thing you had to show everybody.  I got my hand laid open really bad one day, and the second I was back on the job, dude, let me see.  You got to let me see.  Ah, it's a pushy one.  That had nothing.  And guys always show each other the stitches.  Right.  All right, we got to get to the what did we learn, because they're insane today.  Bonnie, what's up?  Hi.  I learned that you guys are out of touch with anyone under 20.  You picked on a 20-year-old and a 13-year-old.  Yeah, that was our show today. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I know it was, and that was really bad.  All right, Bonnie.  Bye.  And again, though, we also date them.  Vinny.  Hey.  Anyone under 20, 13 preferably.  Vinny, go.  I learned Brittany likes to play with fudge.  Yeah, she loves fudge.  Later.  Brittany and her fudge.  You forgot about that.  That happened hours ago.  Eye patch.  Check it in from Brian's Eye.  I learned that Brittany from Big Brothers are CTs and a two-ribber.  A two-ribber is eye patch.  Just tricky dick from Brick. 
[02:51:30]  I learned that Opie washed his face too hard this morning.  Al Mack from The Cliff.  Today I learned that in a couple days, Brian will be good-eaten for some seagulls after  his bloated body is pulled from the Hudson River following his suicide.  Oh, man.  Anthony from West Orange.  I learned Earl doesn't know how to steal another van to you.  Rain Man from Yonkers.  Dudes, a question off the subject.  What happened to the best ass contest? 
[02:52:00]  No girls showed up.  We really, we got off track, though, and didn't push it today.  But tomorrow we are expecting lovely young ladies to come into the studio for the best  ass contest.  We got a legit prize for this one.  What is it, Vegas?  Vegas.  Vegas.  We haven't even had a girl call to say she's on her way.  No.  Any girl, even if you were in the best boob contest.  Here's your second chance.  Get your ass in here. 
[02:52:30]  Today I learned that gauze amazingly cures head wounds and serious eye damage after one  day.  I'm going to invest in Johnson & Johnson.  That's Ray from New Brunswick.  Charles Manson.  I learned where to send my resume.  Today I learned that Brian lasted in the studio as long as Gray Wolf.  Wow.  Please.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Today I learned that horny goat weeds still won't make you hornier than a brass section  at a Sousa convention.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  I learned Earl is a three-inch guy.  Casino from hell.  Let's go to Tom.  Jesus, Tom.  Tom, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Go ahead, man.  Today I learned that all Brittany's babies are going to be born with pink hair.  That's good, buddy.  That's wrong.  Later, guys.  That's good.  Let's go to EJ.  EJ, what's up?  Hey, this is EJ.  EJ the DJ.  This is EJ from Rosedale. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  And I learned that ONA might have to buy some new alarm clocks because they might be waking  up early to go to work soon.  Is this Matt Drudge, Jr.?  Thank you for that.  Let's go to Jack.  Jack, what's up?  Hey, what I learned on the ONA show today is that although I thought the Best Dance in  New York contest was going to be won by a woman, it looks like it's going to be won by 
[02:54:00]  the Invisible Man.  Oh, no.  Ladies, please show up.  Have a good one, guys.  We're going to look really stupid.  Let's go to Joey Big Arms.  Joey Big Arms.  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that Brian lasted longer than the XFL pregame.  True.  Hey, there you go.  He did.  XFL game day.  Back to you, Russ.  Thank you, Joey.  Mike from Elizabeth.  I learned that when my girlfriend says she has to dye her hair, I'm not doing my job.  Hey, what happened to the babysitter's thing?  Yeah, he was supposed to call back. 
[02:54:30]  You're firing people now.  That's going to be your gig.  Oh.  Or telling them that they...  I'll break the bad news tomorrow.  I hear one guy wanted you to tell his wife he wants a divorce.  You're going to be the bad news guy?  That guy hung up, though.  Big Al.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned tomorrow we're going to play Guess What's Under My Bandage.  Hey, that's a good game.  We ought to do that.  We'll get bandages. 
[02:55:00]  We'll stick them on various interns' heads and have something underneath.  And we got to play, like, questions, and then we tear it off, and it's always nothing.  Way to have yet.  All right.  Nick, what's going on?  Yeah, I learned you guys are going to do an internet radio show in the middle of the ocean on the island of California.  Earl, comment.  What's up, man?  Syndication.  Syndication with Psycho Brian, his fake-ass eyes, stops at the lies, because one of you is going to die, and Brian's going to commit suicide. 
[02:55:30]  Wow, look at you.  Look at that.  Eminem.  I learned that Drudge Jr. is the only teen that Anthony can't stand.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Today, I learned that it took longer to fire Psycho Mark than it did Brian.  Attack, attack.  Yeah.  You mess in.  All right.  I think we're done.  That's right.  It is his birthday.  I learned if I went to the same school as Brian, I would stay home tomorrow. 
[02:56:00]  Mr. X is real.  And that's all for today.  Right.  What a day.  My God, man.  It was a mini soap opera.  Who knew?  And we got to talk about masturbation with Britney from Big Brother.  Yeah, that was hot.  That was really hot.  Pretty hot.  She uses a hair dye bottle from Fudge. 
[02:56:30]  And she can take it up to the second rib.  Nice.  Nice.  Let me go to Joe.  Got to get this in.  Hey, guys.  For an obvious reason.  Yes, Joe?  I learned that Ant's more obsessed with Mafia Mob than he is with the Olsen Twins.  Hey, Olsen Twin reference.  Hey, the President Joyce on the message board, man.  All right, Joe.  You almost didn't get one today.  I know.  See how distracted I was?  All right.  I'm going to mention them until they appear on our show. 
[02:57:00]  Craig, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Today on the air, I learned you don't actually need to get a head wound to have brain damage.  Yeah.  You guys talk to be good.  Bye.  All right, buddy.  Let's get out of here, okay?  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Look what I do now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting. 
[02:57:30]  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
