<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a mention of "Whip Em Out Wednesday," followed by celebratory discussion of good ratings and a subsequent lunch with their boss, Ken Stevens.  Opie recounted his attempt to escape the lunch early for video games.  Anthony then shared an uncomfortable anecdote about an overly affectionate encounter with Stevens, which segued into a discussion of previous, sexually explicit incidents involving Stevens in his office, specifically mentioning two instances of anal sex.

The show then featured a highly offensive and mocking critique of Hillary Clinton and Jesse Jackson's speeches at the Democratic National Convention, punctuated by the accidental playing of a sound clip from *Conquest of the Planet of the Apes* instead of Jackson. This led to a humorous segment attempting to decipher the meaning of the phrase "Stay out the bushes."

Next, the hosts found humor in Evel Knievel endorsing mobility scooters, playing and commenting on the commercial.  This was followed by a segment heavily criticizing Anthony for a poorly received joke about tampons, with numerous irate callers expressing their displeasure.  The show concluded this section with a discussion and listener-assisted pronunciation of the Vietnamese name "Phuc," leading to more humorous commentary.

The pronunciation of "Phuc" continued into the next segment, with callers debating the correct pronunciation and potential legal implications. A caller who served in Vietnam and a caller with a Vietnamese mother offered clarifications, including the meaning ("happiness") and variations in pronunciation.  The hosts then incorporated the name into their on-air patter.

The show then focused on Opie's attempts to avoid recording commercials, detailing his past evasion tactics and ultimately playing a recently recorded commercial showcasing his intentionally poor delivery, earning him the nickname "Slappy." Listeners called in with varied opinions on his performance.  A game segment, "King Gimp," followed, where callers guessed what a character from an HBO documentary was saying, sparking a discussion about the tastelessness of making fun of someone's medical condition.  Commercial breaks for a gym, t-shirts, a spa, and car audio were also included, along with a brief mention of Ron Reagan.

The next segment featured a scathing review of the MTV Movie Awards, targeting Sarah Jessica Parker's hosting, and criticizing other celebrities including Samuel L. Jackson, Mel Gibson, and Adam Sandler. A surprise call from Sarah Jessica Parker herself ensued, resulting in a heated exchange challenging the hosts' claims and insults, culminating in an invitation to the *Sex and the City* set.

Following the call, the show abruptly shifted to a segment filled with listener advice on anal sex, featuring crude humor and sexually explicit suggestions from both the hosts and callers.  The show then returned briefly to the MTV Movie Awards, playing audio of Scott Muni broadcasting during the 1977 New York City blackout.  Anthony concluded this segment by discussing a test drive of a Lexus IS300, followed by a highly offensive and crudely edited Mike Tyson impersonation.

The final segment featured a caller, "Mike," launching into a profanity-laced, misogynistic rant against the British Royal Family, specifically Prince Charles, Princess Diana, and Sarah Ferguson, filled with violent and sexually suggestive statements.  Another caller, Tom, joined in the attack on Princess Diana.  The hosts' reactions were interspersed with laughter, though they made some attempts to rein Mike in, resulting in an unrestrained and offensive segment. The segment ended with Mike hanging up, followed by more insults towards Princess Diana from the hosts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Whip Em Out Wednesday!  What is that? Like some kind of guy name?  Like some kind of sexist guy name?  Yeah! You will not get away with it!  I wish you could just shut your bitch up!  It's Whip Em Out Wednesday!  Oubala!  Obi and Anthony. N.E.W.  All right, let's go to the phones. If you have something, give us a call. 
[00:00:30]  Joe, what's going on?  What's up? You're on the air, man.  Hey, what's going on? Yeah, I just want to thank you guys for making my birthday that much more enjoy.  Oh, thank you.  Number two, I'd like to thank you guys.  Ah, wow.  Joe, if you're listening, call back. Your cell phone sucks.  And we want to thank you for listening to the show.  We got some ratings today, and we're hearing...  We're hearing good things. Hearing good things.  Good things. Good things. 
[00:01:00]  That's nice. Seems like the boss is very, very happy in the back office.  Well, they took us out to a lunch today, which always means a good thing.  Good job. Old chap went out.  I'm so bad when I go to lunch with them, too.  Mike, we sit down, and I look at the watch, and I go, all right, it's like one o'clock.  If I'm out of here in a few minutes, I could play Age of Empires instead of sitting here with the two bosses.  All right. And then, like, we get the food, and I'm eating, and then I'm just looking like, oh, he's not pulling out the card yet. 
[00:01:30]  The check ain't here yet.  I'm going, oof, got some business to tend to back at the station, some important stuff to do.  And then I just, I leave, and I'm back on.  All right, I'll be the Vikings. I'm against the Persians.  Right. Yeah, we got to work on the show.  Build my army.  We got to go work on the show.  Very important show prep, boss.  But thank you for lunch. Thank you very much.  Okay, I got to build my walls now.  I need more archers. 
[00:02:00]  Anthony?  Yeah.  Did you actually get a hug from Ken Stevens today?  Yeah, it was a little awkward.  It was a little awkward.  And the word love was used.  Uh-oh.  Hi!  No, he goes, I love you guys.  You just weren't around for the hug.  I wasn't there. I don't know.  Let's just put it this way.  I went into the office to ask about this fine ratings thing that just came out. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  And it's very sketchy.  They don't have the whole picture, but they hear things and they pass along to you.  Sure.  And next thing I know, I'm like, you know, kind of at that big round table he has in his office.  In his office, and God knows what goes on there.  And I'm...  Yeah, that's the office where Psycho Mark had a couple have anal sex.  Yeah.  You can't look at that couch without thinking about Psycho Mark and a couple that had anal sex on there.  What a way to get fired from a job.  God damn it.  That's great.  Yeah, first pumpkin picking with Jeremy and now hugs with Tim. 
[00:03:00]  Oh, come on.  Come on.  No, come on.  I'm kidding.  Help me out.  Help me out a little bit.  Dude, if anyone doesn't understand...  I'm trying to tell you how awkward it was...  I understand.  ...and you can be going right for the abuse.  Let me get the story out there and then you can abuse me.  No more signs, Ben.  Whatever, Ben.  See, I hope I'm helping you.  Whatever, Ben.  Alright.  Alright, listen.  So I'm sitting at that round table, looking at the couch where the couple had the anal sex, giggling to myself, and then he's telling me about these ratings things. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  He has, like, just, you know, an overall picture, but he knows you and I did very well.  Right.  He got, uh, filled with emotion and then all of a sudden, like, he's behind me and he kind of gets...  Oh, wait a minute.  Stop.  Stop.  Come on, man.  No, I'm trying to make...  I'm trying to picture the scene.  I'm really not getting into it.  I was sitting in a chair, though.  Oh, okay.  You're in the chair.  Yeah, it wasn't like he was behind me and I'm standing there.  I didn't know where that was.  Ah.  Alright, so you're in the chair.  This never works when you try to explain yourself. 
[00:04:00]  That trick never works.  That trick never works.  Watch me pull a rabbit out of my head.  Do, do, boo, and speak.  I'm sure the listeners don't want to hear the rest of the story, Anthony.  Sorry.  Alright.  Fine.  I was sitting there.  I was, like, looking at whatever he had on this round table and he was explaining what  had been...  Right, because I was...  No, this is Rick.  Did you feel hot man breath?  Yeah, Rick.  And did Ken grab your ass?  Oh, my God.  And look, he's still writing. 
[00:04:30]  Rick loves this.  See...  Is what called...  Is...  Oh, God damn it.  You know what?  Come on, it's very funny.  The people obviously understand the reality, but they love digging in.  I'm trying to tell you how awkward it was and this is what I get.  I understand.  See, we have audio from the office.  Do you like having your background?  God damn it.  Jesus.  No, no.  He was overcome by emotion because... 
[00:05:00]  I know.  Because when you and I do well, that means he keeps his job for three more months.  Absolutely.  Let's be honest here.  I understand.  You're not going to see the station in the top 20.  No.  No.  When the ratings become public knowledge.  No.  But if we do well, he continues to get to play and do his little radio.  He feels very good about our show.  So he was explaining how well we did.  Yeah.  And he was overcome by emotion.  I'm sitting there.  Overcome.  And all of a sudden, there was just this like awkward arm around my shoulder. 
[00:05:30]  And he was like trying to hug me, I think.  Are you my pal, Danny?  How about a French cat?  How about some sushi?  And then he was like, just like, golly gee, I love you guys.  Like, what are you saying when your boss says I love you?  Opie, we're having a ratings party this Saturday.  Are you doing anything this Saturday?  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh? 
[00:06:00]  Now come on.  I think the audience is smart enough to know the reality of the situation.  It just makes for funny imagery.  Oh, sure.  As I look to the left where the instant feedback's coming in.  Fag, fag, fag, fag.  That tape was going in that office?  What else did I, Ken say?  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  This old gag.  Haven't heard this one before.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Come on. 
[00:06:30]  So he was, he was very happy.  How many times?  Sit back in bed, I guess.  The hell's wrong with you guys.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Taylor, what's going on?  Hey, I had a similar experience this week myself.  Yeah?  I'm a trainer at a security firm.  Yeah.  And I had a really big day.  And at the end of the day, my boss came over and he's like, you know what you're doing today?  to my numbers and he pinched me on the cheek not not once but twice and i swear to god i sat there

And Gore's a tool.  And you get Clinton and Hillary.  Why is the wife of the president speaking? 
[00:11:30]  What the hell is she?  She ran the country.  First quat.  She ran the country for the last eight years.  Everyone knows that.  Yeah.  She couldn't even pay attention to what was happening with Bill's crotch.  And she's going to run New York.  And she's addressing the Democratic Convention.  With that phony, phony politician type speech style.  I'm here to tell you that Al Gore is the man to be president of.  What? 
[00:12:00]  Why are you yelling?  With that monotone yell, no personality crap she's got going.  Because that's how aliens speak, Anthony.  Yeah.  Act, act, act, act.  Act, act, act.  You want to hear something?  I want to tell you.  Listen to every line she says.  Guaranteed, it ends up that monotone crescendo crap thing she does.  She builds as she goes.  It's so fake.  It's a put-on.  She can't be honest and sincere.  It's impossible for that big cap bitch.  One thing you've got to give Bill Clinton. 
[00:12:30]  He's a, he's a, I would, I would even say a great public speaker.  He's a good, yeah, I'll give you that.  But his wife.  What he's talking about is coming out of his ass.  Well, yeah.  But he's a, yeah, he is a great speaker.  He's got personality.  He comes off very natural, smooth.  He can lie with the bed.  He puts that thumb up.  I did not ever, not once have sex with that woman.  Yeah, it's great.  But she is just a stick figure that's pumping out written crap for her.  A stick figure?  You better get your eyes checked, Anthony.  Wow.  Well, let's play some of the audio.  Not sincere. 
[00:13:00]  Here she is from the other day.  Last night?  I don't know, because I'm not watching this crap.  Bill and I are closing one chapter of our lives.  And soon we'll be starting a new one.  For me, it will be up to the people of New York to decide whether I'll have the privilege  of serving them in the United States Senate.  Thanks, guys.  I didn't know Bill Clinton was married to China. 
[00:13:30]  Act, act, act, act, act.  Listen to her voice.  Yeah.  She sounds like China from the WWF.  Doesn't she?  Listen for the first, like, three seconds.  Bill and I are closing.  Doesn't that sound like China?  Yeah, a little bit.  How's that kind of female-male voice thing happening?  It's all written for closing a chapter in our lives, and I'll be closing my legs forever.  Yeah.  There ain't no way in hell I'm putting that infected tool in here. 
[00:14:00]  Fitting every hose bag on the beltway.  You think Hillary talked to Bill like that?  Yeah, at home.  I can't believe, Bill, that you put your tool in that piece of trash.  Monica Lewinsky.  And she waits for the applause.  Uh-uh.  Act, act, act.  Here's another clip from Hillary Anthony.  At this moment of great potential, let's not squander our children's futures. 
[00:14:30]  Children again.  Let's elect leaders who will leave no child behind.  Leaders who don't just talk the talk, but walk the walk.  Leaders like Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.  Act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act.  Act, act, act, act.  What a tool, listen to it.  It's not real.  Bang me, bang me.  Stick it in and start the banging. 
[00:15:00]  Once a wrong killer, always a wrong killer.  We got one more clip.  Oh, the crescendo, the phony crescendo.  Hillary sounds like the church lady.  That's good, too.  Yes.  Thank you for supporting my husband, whose visionary leadership and hard work led America into the 21st century. 
[00:15:30]  Which is more annoying?  What?  Hillary?  Thank you for supporting my husband, whose visionary leadership and hard work led America into the 21st century.  Thank you.  Hillary or a dentist drill.  Hmm.  That's a wacky speaking, uh...  I am fake and phony, but you will vote for me. 
[00:16:00]  You are hypnotized.  She's got them big swirly pinwheel eyes as she's looking at you.  Look into my eyes.  Every picture they have of her in the paper.  Yeah, she's got the alien eyes working.  She's too much, man.  And she's turning the convention into, like, this platform for her.  You know, you didn't see Lazio at the Republican convention.  No, but you didn't see him just pawing over himself and getting the exposure she's getting. 
[00:16:30]  She's such a phony, too.  You see the paper today there?  They got a shot of the whole first family coming out of McDonald's.  Yeah.  She doesn't like McDonald's.  Her husband supposedly likes McDonald's.  I love Bubba.  There she is with her little bag of McDonald's food walking out of McDonald's.  Please.  Who's buying that?  I'll like a number three and please supersize it!  Puppets are all clapping.  Ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[00:17:00]  I heard Jesse Jackson was speaking.  And it was just unintelligible.  It was worse than ah, ah, ah, ah.  What was he saying?  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  Stay out the bushes!  Like trying to get a chant going.  Like keep hope alive!  Keep hope alive!  Stay out the bushes is the new big chant.  I guess so you don't go with the George W. Bush camp.  You stay out the bushes.  That could be a nice rap song. 
[00:17:30]  Stay out the bushes!  What do you want on this wall?  Stay out the bushes!  What do you want on this wall?  I gotta hear some of the Jesse clips.  Do we have any?  Yeah, we'll find them, Anthony.  Because I just hear every year, or every four years, he gets up there in front of the convention  and babbles, and the people, the anchors get on the news afterwards and go,  once again, Jesse Jackson, what a fabulous speaker this man is, bringing the crowd to its feet.  And I'm watching, going, did you watch the same speech? 
[00:18:00]  I didn't understand a word this guy said.  He's using these words, and what kind of accent is that?  Well, wow!  What?  That would be the African-American accent.  Nah, it's even worse than that.  I don't know what it is.  I don't know what that is.  It's just a joke.  If he spoke in front of the Apollo, they'd all be going, what?  Say what?  I don't even understand what you're saying.  We have the Jesse Jackson speech?  Let's hear some of Jesse.  You wanted the audio, right, Ed?  Yeah, I have to hear some audio of Jesse Jackson at the Democratic Convention speaking. 
[00:18:30]  Earl's like, what are you talking about?  I read the transcript to the speech, and Jesse sounded amazing.  I'm like, that's reading what he was supposed to be saying.  You can't understand what he's saying when he's just talking.  When you read the transcript of an Ozzy Osbourne interview, it makes sense, too.  He's like, oh, that Jesse, what a fabulous speaker.  It's like, everyone buys the hype.  Let's listen to a little audio.  Does he rhyme?  Jesse Jackson, Ed.  Oh, he does?  Yeah, let's hear him rhyme.  More health care with gore. 
[00:19:00]  More education with gore.  More health with gore.  More wages with gore.  More freedom with gore.  More freedom with gore.  What is that fabulous speaking?  That's amazing speaking that everyone's getting all riled up.  More health care with gore.  Gore?  What is that, an alien that's running? 
[00:19:30]  He's making it very simple, Ed.  We like gore.  We like gore.  Vol.  Vol puts fruit on the trees.  We love gore.  We love gore.  Yeah, you can't be the Star Trek driver.  Vol.  Well, I have some more, Anthony.  Gore.  I got some more.  Gore.  I got some more gore from Jesse Jackson.  No, gore.  Gore.  It's more and gore.  It's more and gore.  She votes a lot. 
[00:20:00]  She votes a lot.  Wow, bitch, man.  She votes a lot.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I got to tell you, I love Jesse.  Keep hope alive.  I like that.  And I have to apologize to all our listeners.  That's not the audio of Jesse Jackson.  That's the audio of Caesar from Planet of the Apes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, crap. 
[00:20:30]  Boy, when Caesar was getting everyone riled up at the end of what movie was that?  The second one, Anthony?  Conquest of the Planet of the Apes.  Conquest, yeah.  Keep holding up.  More health care with Gore.  Gore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's more and gore.  It's more and gore.  She votes a lot.  She votes a lot.  She votes a lot. 
[00:21:00]  Now, she goes.  I got it from the Hebrew.  More health care with Gore.  More education with Gore.  More health with Gore.  More wages with Gore.  More feelings with Gore.  More.  All right, here's the best Jesse Jackson clip of all of them. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Oh, Lordy, Lord, he's desperate.  Do what he says. 
[00:22:00]  Do what he says.  Stay out the bushes.  There it is, Anthony.  Listen to this.  Do you use your tongue, Bertier, and a $20? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, Lordy, whore.  Oh, my God.  Unbelievable.  Stay out the bushes.  What the?  Stay out the bushes.  Gore.  Let me tell you about Gore.  Stay out the bushes.  Live in law.  Live in law.  Tim, I.  Gore from the planet Plutonium.  Gore.  Stay out the bushes.  I need that, man. 
[00:23:00]  I need stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  What is he talking about?  And people buy the myth.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Okay, terrific.  Piece of politics with Robin Williams is the comedy.  Everyone buys the myth, and then you realize, my God, there's nothing going on there.  You know what I mean?  When Robin Williams is rolling off on his tirade, oh, look, look, it's a softball. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, it's a ball, but it's softball.  Oh, he's genius.  Look.  Stream of consciousness.  And you realize he said nothing funny, but everyone's laughing.  Same thing with Jesse.  Like, everyone's, oh, my God, Jesse, what a powerful speaker.  This is great.  He's saying, stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  My friggin' 70-year-old neighbor used to say that when we used to go traipsing through a garden.  Stay out the bushes, you damn kids.  He didn't even say, stay out of the bushes.  No, no, it was stay out the bushes. 
[00:24:00]  Stay out what you want in these bushes.  Let's go to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Stay out the bushes and keep off the grass.  Keep off the grass.  Keep off the grass.  Step on a crack, break your mama's back.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you, Tony.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, I'm over here now.  Here, let's do a boogaloo-googaloo, stay out of the bushes little remake. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  You got a musical background for it?  Let's see.  Now, give us some Fat Boy Slim.  God, that'll be good.  We'll give you a little Fat Boy Slim mix here.  Fat Boy Slim while I'm pounding some quim.  Hot 97 should hire us, man.  We can do mixes on the fly.  Sure.  Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo.  Stay out the bushes.  I'm over here now.  Stay out the bushes. 
[00:25:00]  I'm over here now.  Stay out the bushes.  Boogaloo, boogaloo.  Boogaloo, boogaloo.  Boogaloo, boogaloo.  Stay out the bushes.  I'm over here now.  It's like a wreck.  It's in the hole.  I'm over here now.  Stay out the bushes.  Hootah, hootah.  I'm over here now. 
[00:25:30]  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Yeah.  Stay out the bushes.  Like you, did he stay, I'm trying to analyze this.  Maybe I get a little too deep into these things, but I'm really trying to say, was he sitting  down going, I got to come up with something funny and something good that I could say  at the speech and it'll be very profound and very innocent to people that are listening  on my speech.  Hmm.  What is that?  Bush, Bush, Bush. 
[00:26:00]  Kiss my sackbag.  No, that's not good.  I got to think more on what I should say to the Democratic convention.  So, Anthony, stay off the ground.  In all seriousness, though, what does stay out the bushes mean?  Like, don't go, I'm guessing don't go over to the bush camp.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  But there's only one bush.  It's George W. Bush and he's running. 
[00:26:30]  Stay out the bushes.  It doesn't make sense.  Like, he's addressing the crowd of Democrats, so it's not like they're going to turn around  and go to the bushes.  Don't pee in the bushes.  Don't pee in the bushes.  Keep out.  Keep out the bushes.  Stay out the bushes.  Maybe Earl can translate.  Earl.  Earl.  Hey, Earl.  I'm riding my speed forward to the convention.  I'm trying to come up with something right now real funny.  Entertaining.  Earl, what the hell does stay out the bushes mean? 
[00:27:00]  No, he was talking about the policies of G.W. in Texas and Jeb in Florida.  Oh, so there's the two bushes.  Yes, that you're supposed to stay out of.  What, don't have anal sex with the bushes?  Stay out the bushes.  They got disease there.  My speeches have lost some of the flavor of many of your speeches there.  Why doesn't he just communicate with clicks and clenks? 
[00:27:30]  Oh, that's outrageous, but this isn't.  Stay out the bushes.  Stay out the Heimitown.  Remember that, Jesse, calling New York Heimitown?  And admitting that he spit in white people's food when he's working his way through college.  And still in the political scene.  And for some reason, that's okay.  How could that be okay?  All right, Donna is going to explain, stay out the bushes. 
[00:28:00]  All right, Donna.  Donna?  Hello?  Hi.  Keep out the bushes.  I think he meant keep the bushes out of the White House.  No, stay out the bushes.  Well, what's stay out the bushes?  Stay out the bushes.  Oh, well, then he's just dumb.  Thank you, Donna.  Charles, stay out the bushes.  What does that mean?  He's getting better, right?  Working on him.  Charles.  Yeah, guys.  Go ahead.  You're on the radio.  Like you said, stay out the bushes. 
[00:28:30]  You mean keep the bushes out of the White House.  All right.  Well, that's not that.  Why didn't he say that?  That's keep the bushes out, but it doesn't make sense that way either.  Well, let me ask you this.  Did you notice that the more he yells, the more and more he sounds like Reverend Allen?  Oh, he does.  Yeah.  He sounds like Reverend Allen when he yells.  It's a bigger lack of intelligence.  The more he gets, the more he sounds like Reverend Allen.  You know what it is?  It's like a sequel.  Because you remember years ago when he was at the Democratic Convention and he gave a fiery speech  and people were just like, oh, my God, Jesse is a genius.  I don't understand how anyone can top this speech that Jesse has given. 
[00:29:00]  This is going back a few conventions ago.  And now it's like the sequel.  Every time Jesse's speech is getting more and more lame.  We're up to like Jaws 3D now.  Or Jaws 4.  It's personal.  Where the shark follows you to the Bahamas.  Now it just blows and it's not, it isn't working anymore.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Stay out the bushes, get in the ****.  Stay out the bra. 
[00:29:30]  Stay out the bra.  Stay out the bra.  There you go.  Stay out the bra.  Stay out the bushes.  That's right.  You've got to stay out the bushes.  Eating ain't cheating.  That's what I always say to my wife, George.  Stay out the bushes.  And put it in the mouth, you bitch.  Suck it.  Stay out the bushes.  I love it.  I love it.  Wonderful.  Fantastic.  Terrific.  We've got to take a break, Anthony. 
[00:30:00]  Stay out the bushes.  Jay Moore is gate.  August 17th through the 20th.  Caroline.  Stay out the bushes.  W-N-E-W.  Five shows.  Boys, guys.  Morning.  I'm 10 to 2.  It's me, Lester Gold, the radio chair.  Hey, it's the most fun you can have about using your hands.  It's Presto Panic.  Afternoons, it's Opie and Anthony.  Two to seven.  Ben at seven.  Ben, Ben, and I go. 
[00:30:30]  Ron and Fez.com.  Late night.  1027.  W-N-E-W.  What we can do to Evil Knievel real fast.  Oh.  This was brought to our attention today.  What would Evil Knievel be promoting?  He's lending his image and his endorsement to a product.  So I'm thinking maybe Harley Davidson.  Sure.  Or maybe something that would go along with his daredevil image.  Maybe a line of clothing.  Extreme something. 
[00:31:00]  Maybe a line of Sky Cycle.  The Sky Cycle.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe that's a reality now in the year 2000.  We could all drive on Sky Cycle.  Jump the Snake River Canyon.  Sure.  Even though he's up there in years, he's still known as the daredevil.  Maybe some line of skateboards or anything.  Yeah.  Anything but this.  Yeah.  Opie, Evil Knievel, the proud endorser for Pride Mobility Products.  The Little Rascal. 
[00:31:30]  He's endorsing the Little Rascal.  There he is.  Yeah.  There he is in the advertisement.  There's Evil.  He's got his red, white, and blue jacket on.  Yeah.  With the number one that he used to wear.  Yeah.  On there.  And he's sitting on one of those old people scooters that the old people use.  Getting ready to try to jump a garbage can.  It looks like, I'm going to jump my own colostomy bags.  I'm lining up 20 colostomy bags. 
[00:32:00]  All full.  Yes.  And now he's riding around on one of those little old people scooters.  Oh, is time just a pain in the ass?  This is the same guy that jumped the fountains at Caesars, right?  Right.  He's falling like a rag doll.  Broke every bone in his body.  And now he's, out of my way, please.  Please.  Look out.  This thing gets up to three miles an hour.  Guy used to speed up that ramp. 
[00:32:30]  Remember that?  Oh, it was so cool to watch.  You'd look forward to it on TV.  Oh, on ABC Wide World of Sports.  Evil Knievel's jumping.  He would bang the Hollywood starlets at night.  Boozer.  Boozer.  Insane.  Would tumble during the day.  Now look at him.  Now look at him.  Time just sucks.  Who are you kidding?  He's got his hands on the hand grips.  He's looking straight into, I guess, what the camera was taking this picture.  But his face just looks like, oh, my God, look what I'm doing.  Look what I have become.  Look what I have to do now for the money. 
[00:33:00]  I have to endorse this little scooter.  Well, there's a quote from Evil Knievel, Anthony.  He said, what is it?  I chose my pride legend.  They have fancy names for the little rascal.  The pride legend scooter.  The pride legend.  You'll kick ass on the pride legend scooter.  Pick up babes on the pride legend.  Evil Knievel withers around on his pride legend scooter.  Legend, legend, legend, legend.  You'll get up to three miles per hour. 
[00:33:30]  Pride legend.  It's a little rascal.  Anyway, it says, I chose my pride legend for its outstanding performance style.  Performance for ability and value.  Evil Knievel.  Performance.  It goes.  That's the only performance you're getting.  I can't stand these frigging things, too.  Whenever you get the people in the supermarket, look, I'm sorry you can't walk.  And I'll tell you the truth.  Half of the people riding these things are fine.  Fat people.  They found a way they don't even have to frigging walk anymore. 
[00:34:00]  Remember when fat people used to at least have to walk in the supermarket to get their food to feed their fat bodies?  They'd be walking around.  Sweating by the Twinkies and the soda and everything.  Now they're just going around clogging the aisles up chatting with each other like it's a side street.  The pride legend scooter. 
[00:34:30]  And then you go to a place like Disney.  Oh, my God.  Anybody.  That's a little rascal heaven.  Anybody, I guess, can just hop on one.  Doesn't matter.  Healthy, whatever.  And you're trying to walk.  And you're being, you're almost being hit by these people that don't even know how to control them anymore.  In the background, you just hear beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Excuse me, please.  I want to see the fireworks display at Epcot.  And I'm two miles away, so I only have five hours to get there. 
[00:35:00]  Evel Knievel would be appearing jumping the small fountain in front of the place.  I'm going to jump a puddle on my pride legend.  It's going to be cool.  Remember how I used to take the motorcycle up the ramp?  And I would stop right at the top and overlook the jump before I backed down and made the final run?  Yeah.  I tried it, but my scooter won't even go up the ramp.  It hits the front and goes, sud, and just stopped.  He chose his pride legend. 
[00:35:30]  Evel, have some pride and, like, try to jump the Snake River Canyon in this thing.  Go out, go out in a blaze of glory.  Throw a rocket pack on it.  Yeah, throw a rocket pack on it and see if you can jump that damn Snake River Canyon.  Go out in a blaze of fire.  Come on.  You're our hero from when we grew up.  You're on a little rascal now.  He's probably cranked that thing up to, like, 40, 50 miles an hour.  He's got mechanics organized.  You think he tries to do donuts with it in the park and, like, wheelies and stuff?  He's our goddamn childhood hero, and he's on a little rascal now. 
[00:36:00]  Call now.  Get one of those pairs of old people sunglasses free.  Yeah, the wraparound Terminator sunglasses.  Pride legend.  He's got his blue jeans pulled up to his nipples in the picture, too.  You'll be kicking ass and taking names on your pride legend scooter.  Damn.  That's all.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  I was down at Disney back in December, and I saw one of these old geezers come flying by  doing three miles an hour on one of those things.  Next thing you know, he's checking out a babe walking by, and he smashes into, like, this three-year-old. 
[00:36:30]  Unbelievable.  The guys are picking up the kid that crying, oh, my God, oh, my God.  They pick up the kid to see if he's okay.  The next thing you know, the little guy takes off.  Takes off.  Where's he going?  I think he can catch up.  I felt so bad for the little kid, but when I saw the old guy go, I was like, oh, man,  he's making his getaway.  That's funny.  Now look at him, though.  I know.  He's on a little scooter.  He's got a little basket on the front for his depend undergarments. 
[00:37:00]  You see that little basket?  What's the evil going to carry in there?  A little little bottle of whiskey?  Probably his kidney.  His liver.  His penis pump.  Poor guy.  He's had a kidney transplant already.  Yeah.  Chrome pipes.  You see him try to weld on some chrome pipes?  I want that to sound like my old bike.  Yeah.  Instead of, like, electric motor. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, he's got his blue cowboy boots on.  Oh, my God.  He looks horrible.  Poor evil.  Is this true?  What?  Evil Knievel's next trick on the rascal.  He's going to jump 10 14-inch U-Hauls.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

And I blurt something out. It doesn't quite go over with the audience. And they just  pound me.  And it's just fun because most of your stuff hits the mark. So when you don't hit the mark,  it's kind of fun to watch it squirm.  Who's checking in? Show me crickets. 
[00:39:30]  Captain Cranky Ass from Queens. Today I learned Anthony can bomb just as bad as spaz.  Oh, come on.  Cricket. Hey, Ant, I got it. Yeah, thank you. I guess when you were in the market for tampons,  you watched the commercials, Ant. We all changed the tampons. I couldn't even defend myself.  White shorts. Hey, Ant, you hear the bomb dropping?  Oh, wait, Ant, I got to play something here.  Oh, yeah?  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts, right? 
[00:40:00]  White shorts?  Am I missing some?  Oh, come on. You got to get that one.  Anybody out there would get that one.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts.  White shorts?  Yeah.  It's a reference to maybe a tampon commercial.  Oh, come on.  No one got it. 
[00:40:30]  I'm sure the audience did.  Okay, terrific.  Shout it out, Ant. Shout it out.  Oh, my God.  You trip up once, and that's it, huh?  It's over, Johnny.  When did you start doing this show?  Figure it out.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  You should have shouted out the joke when it didn't work the first time.  As the Joe says, South Orange, hey, Ant, I hear if the joke doesn't work the first time,  you should yell it out the next time. 
[00:41:00]  Is this thing on?  Ping pong, anyone?  Look at this.  I'm being totally hammered.  No, you're not, Ant.  Let's go to the phones.  Everyone's very, very polite here.  Hey, Ant, is that a train?  Our listeners are very understand.  Yeah.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, I just want to say, all of a sudden, Spaz sounds like Milton Berle compared to that  Anthony, what the hell are you thinking about?  All of a sudden, 922 wine sounds brilliant. 
[00:41:30]  Are you ready to laugh?  I said, are you ready to laugh?  Okay, we can stop now.  Tom from Bay Ridge, maybe Wendy took half of Anthony's sense of humor.  Hey, Ant, does your girlfriend even need tampons yet?  Very funny, the listeners, I'll be very funny.  Play Pac-Man sound here.  When do we start Anthony's week in review? 
[00:42:00]  I got a brutal email about you today.  I meant to bring it up.  What?  They want to make sure that your girlfriend is sleeping on her back because they don't want  her to get SIDS.  Would I have a sudden infant death syndrome open?  Yes, it would be.  Very funny.  No, I make sure.  The crap you guys throw at us on a daily basis, man, I make sure. 
[00:42:30]  I crank the little mobile up over the crib and it goes around and jackass.  Wow, you're just getting pounded.  I know, the only thing that went over anyone's head was the Enola Gay over Anthony's head on  that joke.  White shorts.  Everyone's feeling good about themselves because you crack them up every day.  They finally, boy, one slip up and they just, they don't let you sleep.  Just like us, they'll pound something into the ground.  It's over, Johnny. 
[00:43:00]  If you let me, Anthony.  John from Staten Island.  If Ant drops a bomb in the middle of the woods, does it make a sound?  Is Anthony a special guest on Mason and Kalinsky?  Jason from Riverhead.  Please, guys, serious comments for Anthony only.  Hey, Anthony, great line.  I can't wait to see it on the AFI 100 Funniest Lines.  You've been hanging around Spaz too long. 
[00:43:30]  Dice checking in from over here.  You want to open for me at the comedy toilet?  Bill from Jersey.  Tonight a privilege.  One night only.  From the O&A show.  Anthony.  Anthony.  Even the cockroaches didn't survive that bomb.  Holy cow.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you, people.  I understand now.  They're getting violent on the phones now.  Ed.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing.  What are you guys doing? 
[00:44:00]  I'm talking to you.  Hey.  That was one of the worst jokes I've ever heard of mine.  What are you doing listening to a tampon commercial and knowing the lines from it?  What?  I watch a lot of TV and I don't always turn the commercials off.  Sometimes there's, you know, a hot girl on the tampon commercial.  I'm backpedaling.  I know you are.  Totally.  Just like Sarah Jessica Parker.  It doesn't happen often, so it's kind of fun to watch a square, man.  It's not working.  All right, Ed.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Jason from River Edge.  He's just pounding you, man. 
[00:44:30]  Thank you.  At this point, I don't think he's a fan of you, man.  Thank you, Tim.  White shorts.  Is that the in color with all the teenagers this summer?  Thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  All right, I'm trying to help you out, Anthony.  The Enola Gay checking in.  From McDonnell Douglas.  I feel so empty. 
[00:45:00]  Hey, Anthony, do your jokes ever have that not-so-fresh feeling?  Opie may be cooler than Hitler, but Hitler was funnier than Anthony.  Oh, I can't allow my pal to get pounded like this.  The show's not even over, and I already learned that Anthony can stink up a room with jokes  that even Spaz threw away.  Come on.  Give me a break here. 
[00:45:30]  It wasn't even a joke.  It was just an off comment.  All right, let's go to Andrew.  Hey, Andrew, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  What's up, man?  Anthony, next time you do a Paisanos commercial, maybe your girlfriend can come in and talk  about the children's menu.  You're laughing in the hallways, Anthony.  I'm trying to.  Very funny.  You know me.  I'm trying to help you out here.  I will not allow this to go on, Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  Brenda Vaccaro checking in, Anthony, from the 70s.  Give me my joke back.  It's hard for him to ignore those tampon commercials while he's watching his sofa.  Shut up.  God, I hate you, man.  Me?  I'm trying to get out of here.  No, I'm talking to all the listeners.  Yes.  Stay down, Rock.  Just stay down. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  I can't read this one.  I promise you will not hate me if I read this one.  It's from a girl, Heather from Fairfield.  Hey, Anthony, do you watch the tampon commercials with your girlfriend in preparation for her big day?  Yeah, that's exactly it.  I tell her all the time, don't be afraid when it happens.  It's part of becoming a woman.  You F and C word. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, what happened?  Opie's usually the one who always puts his foot in his mouth.  Not you.  That's true.  That's why this is fun.  It happens.  What can I say?  Oh, my God.  Dude, it's just painful on the phone.  I can see.  Let's go to Mark.  Hi, Mark.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Yeah, is it true that Ant brought his girlfriend in for bringing his daughter to work day?  Ant, I'm sorry.  I thought he...  I saw boobs on the highway.  I see.  Yes. 
[00:47:30]  I don't understand.  The guy got wowed on the turnpike.  I know.  They lied.  Just to get through with those hysterical remarks that they're making.  I apologize, Anthony.  Someone wants to know if you're going to be at left of your balls off.  In Poughkeepsie.  Opening for the dice, man, with my funny tampon joke.  Says your girlfriend wears tampons or diapers.  I see.  I see.  The humor is, you know, taking the truth and then exaggerating it so much, Opie, that it 
[00:48:00]  just becomes hysterically funny like the listeners are doing diapers.  See, that's so funny.  All right.  We're done with that, right?  Thank you.  Thank you, listeners.  It was fun.  Oh, man, this just in.  I want to shut them up.  This guy's giving you advice.  Tell them how you traded in your 63 for an 81. 
[00:48:30]  Jesus Christ.  We could take a break if you like, Anthony.  That usually helps things along.  Oh, does it?  Yeah.  Man, you say one thing.  Looks like Jim got wowed on the L.A.E.  Jim.  Yo, listen.  I got two tickets for Sesame Street Live.  We can't go because my daughter's got her adoption taken out.  Maybe Anthony wants them.  Yeah, sure.  I'll go.  Oh, wow. 
[00:49:00]  Daddy up in Westchester.  He just got wowed.  Daddy.  Hello.  Yeah, what's up, Daddy?  Yeah, hey.  I just called to find out if Anthony talks as well.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, Joe.  Ant, was your girlfriend alive during the Bill Buckner incident?  That's Mike from Rockland.  Kenny from Oceanside.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  What's funnier?  Uh, Paul. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, this is a good one.  Paul from Lawrence.  I think I heard someone order a gin and tonic.  Hey, Anthony, the other one is this son.  Bob Hope checking.  Anthony, he's one funny guy.  Uh, Berger from New Rochelle.  Ronnie King didn't take a beating this bad.  It was one lousy line.  That's one friggin' thing.  One lousy line in the middle of commercials.  Give me a break here.  All right.  I'm being hammered. 
[00:50:00]  When Anthony's girlfriend accused him of being a pedophile,  Anthony said,  that's a mighty big word for a 12-year-old.  Can I go on record as saying,  my girlfriend is not 12 years old?  Okay.  Can I at least say that?  Yes, you can.  You're a bunch of frickin' jackassies.  She just had a birthday.  Uh, Howie from New York.  Shut up! 
[00:50:30]  Anthony.  Howie from New York writes,  Anthony, turning comedy into tragedy.  That's funny.  All right.  I think you've taken it off the juice there, huh?  Anthony, how much are your girlfriend's Girl Scout cookies?  I mean, you know.  I apologize, Anthony.  Bill from Jersey.  Anthony, don't be so hard on yourself.  I got it.  I like to dress up as a woman and play with tampons.  They're running them in here really fast, though, Anthony. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, aren't they?  No, Eric.  Eric writes, Anthony.  Oh, she's 11?  No.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts, right?  Okay.  Wait, do the crickets for me, Ant?  Thank you.  You've got to abuse yourself.  That's really funny.  You've got the machine.  One more time.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts, right?  Okay. 
[00:51:30]  Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.  I'll be here all week.  Try the veal.  You could bike, swim, and wear white shorts, right?  All the news you need to know, and boom.

[00:53:30]  Opie?  Yes, Anthony?  Remember, you always refer to the little girl running down the streets of Vietnam.  Remember that picture?  One of the most famous pictures ever.  Nine-year-old Vietnamese girl severely burned by napalm.  Runs down a village road.  Well, she's putting a book out.  She's got a little book out open.  Everyone's putting a book out.  You might ask,  No, Anthony, why are you bringing this up? 
[00:54:00]  Yeah, why, Anthony?  Well, it's her name.  Her name?  Her name.  Does she have one of those wacky names?  She's got a wacky name.  And I want John to lay off the button.  I want John the Dump Guy to lay off the button.  All right, hold on.  Because I'm reading a name out of the page.  Let me see the name.  All right, Opie.  Look right in the box here.  And you can see what her name is.  Okay.  Whoa, really? 
[00:54:30]  There you go.  How the hell do you say that on the air?  It's her name.  Maybe you should spell the last name before you say it,  just to make sure we're safe.  I don't understand how you wouldn't be able to say the girl's name.  It's in USA Today.  Okay.  She's got a book out.  She's the one that ran down the street screaming naked.  She said you spell it first.  Spell it first.  Spell it first.  Well, Kim.  Kim.  K-I-M.  Okay. 
[00:55:00]  Her last name is spelled P-H-U-C.  All right, kids.  Hold on your hats.  That would make her name Kim Fuck.  Well, what?  There's no way that's her name.  Is that really how you pronounce that?  I would say so.  Maybe we could get an Asian person on the air to help us along. 
[00:55:30]  We get somebody on.  I'm just reading it phonetically as I see it written time and time again.  Did they dump out of that?  Well, as it says, Canadian writer Denise Chong begins her accounts of Fuck's life, unusual life, by describing the girl's close-knit family and the turmoil of war-torn Vietnam.  Well, the picture. 
[00:56:00]  I'm reading from the paper.  It says that line?  Yeah.  Show me where it says that line.  Let me see that line.  What's up?  Let me see.  You read word for word.  Let me see.  Look.  You read some.  Because I don't want to dwell on that.  Whoa, look at that.  It does say that.  Okay.  It's her name.  It's in the paper.  You want to see... 
[00:56:30]  What is it?  Page 6D of USA Today.  USA Today.  Kim, P-H-U-C.  Right.  There you go.  Thank you, Anthony.  Now the radio first.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Ike is saying it's pronounced a different way, Anthony.  Let's hear from Ike.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Yeah, it's actually not Phuk.  It's pronounced Phuk.  P-H-U-K.  Oh, please.  I'm not kidding.  There's a place in Thailand.  You know, some of these Southeast Asian places have similar names. 
[00:57:00]  A place in Thailand, and I'm not joking, is called Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Phuket.  Well, this is a C.  I don't know.  It's not, you know, spelt in Thai.  Phuket.  This is spelt in English, guys.  I am going to do something.  I'm going to check on a website, and I know we'll be able to get to the bottom of that.  All right.  I will go to Switchboard.  Right.  And then we may be able to call somebody with this name. 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  All right.  Phuket.  That's it.  No city.  No nothing.  There we go.  The Reverend Anthony.  Bye.  Hang, hang, hang.  Okay.  Dial them up.  Is there anyone with the first name Anita Anthony?  Anita.  I don't want to push it.  You don't have to say the last name.  Name some of the first names.  Just read off some of the first names of the P-H-U-C family. 
[00:58:00]  Funny.  The first one is the Reverend Anthony P-H-U-C.  Okay.  Phuk.  Or, if you want to pronounce it, I don't know.  Din.  Hao.  Lu.  Ma.  Yin.  And...  No Anita.  No Anita.  Big.  Do you want me to call them?  Yeah, call them.  Nying, rang, tai, tai, tai.  Write down some of the numbers.  Let's call them up and find out how it's pronounced. 
[00:58:30]  Go ahead.  Write down some numbers.  Let's get this.  Because the person with the name should know how to pronounce it.  That's right.  Mario, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Listen, I just want to know.  I have a Chinese girlfriend.  And that P-H-U-C is not pronounced like you guys are saying it.  She's Vietnamese, this lady, though.  Well, it's all Oriental.  All the same thing.  It's pronounced Puck.  It's not Puck.  All right.  We will see.  I hate to throw a damper on it.  We will see.  We'll get to the bottom.  I think the best person to tell us how the name is pronounced is someone with that name. 
[00:59:00]  That's right.  Do you concur?  I concur.  Okay.  Rick.  Rick will get to the bottom of it.  Well, get started with a couple of those numbers first.  Let's see if we can dial that right up.  There's no one called some dumb.  I want to go to the phones, but we're just pushing it.  No, I'm just like she'd be, Spencer, like she'd be walking around if she got hit with an effing A-bomb, Mike, you stupid ass. 
[00:59:30]  Brilliant.  Yeah, Mike.  That was Hiroshima.  No, Mike, you were wrong this time around.  Everyone's laughing.  They went out.  We were just pronouncing someone's name.  Of course it has to go out there.  Someone's saying exactly pronounced Puck.  You guys are finished.  We're not finished.  We were saying a name.  Yeah.  Japanese dirty knees.  Look at these.  Remember that one? 
[01:00:00]  That was P-H-U-C-I-N-G funny.  No, she wasn't found in contaminated water.  Why is everyone freaking out?  Because we pronounced someone's last name.  Yeah.  That's how it's spelt in the paper.  Very, very respected periodical.  The USA Today.  Guys, I'm just writing to say goodbye because there's no way you're getting away with that.  Oh, come on. 
[01:00:30]  Wait until the lawyers get wind of this one.  P-H-U-C-U.  Hey, it's P-H-U-C-U Friday tomorrow.  Right.  P-H-U-C is not pronounced.  And then he spells it correctly.  It's pronounced lick my hairy aunt with a shh while I shove my aunt down your mother's throat.  Thank you very much.  Very good.  This guy says he was in Vietnam and he knows how to pronounce the word.  All right.  Nick, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  What were you in the math? 
[01:01:00]  I was in the Mekong Delta and I was in a place called, it's spelled B-I-N-H-P-H-O-U-C.  It was pronounced Binh Phuc.  And the name you're pronouncing, Anthony, has the correct pronunciation.  Yeah, O-U-C would be Phuc.  Right.  I was in Binh Phuc.  And it was a big joke because it was such a ridiculous place that when you got there,  they told you, you've been Phuc.  So Anthony's really pronouncing it the right way, huh? 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Yeah, that's the correct pronunciation, yeah.  That rocks.  There you go.  Let's name someone that on our show so we can use it every day.  Yeah, that would be good.  We've got to hire someone.  O.D. has a new name.  That's it.  Old, dirty, dirty, P-H-U-C.  What's the problem with the phone?  We're waiting for a record to get through to someone.  We should be able to get some Phuc on the phone.  Dial that Phuc-er up. 
[01:02:00]  That's what I was saying.  Every nationality pronounces it differently.  I'm just, I called it as I sees it.  You're right on top of it.  So do I.  I see the hotline is busy, but we're getting no results.  He's getting answering machines.  Answering machines?  They're a bunch of working Phucs.  Is that the sound of the FCC cash register I'm hearing?  I would love to see him get over on that one, you know?  Please.  Name.  How the hell are you supposed to say it?  We're reporting the news as it happens. 
[01:02:30]  Here's a guy that's from, who's Vietnamese?  Hello.  Hey, Cliff, what's up?  Not much.  My mother's Vietnamese.  I actually have a Vietnamese dictionary in front of me.  Yeah.  And it's, I don't know if there's an accent.  I don't have the USA Today article, the paper of record, but Phuc.  There's an accent on the U usually.  And it means happiness.  And you pretty much are pronouncing it right.  In Vietnam, it's just, I think, when I was over there, they pronounced it that way also.  But I can't, as in, I was born here, the inflection, I can't get it right. 
[01:03:00]  So it just comes out like that.  So we're correct, right?  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  See a lot of people saying.  Everybody's getting all over themselves about, you know.  All right.  You're just saying the name.  Thank you.  Yep, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  The girl's close-knit, extended family in, you can look at where she lived, Trang Bang.  She lived in Trang Bang.  Get out of here.  That's it.  That's where the, uh, the hire.  That's where you go for the, uh, PHUC reunion.  As it's pronounced, the Phuc family lived in Trang Bang, Vietnam.

Yes, yes.  I want to hear you admit that that's indeed how you got out of, uh... 
[01:05:30]  Anthony, um, I didn't try to get out of, uh, you know, doing commercials for the fine radio station we've worked for.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I used all my skills that I, that I learned since I was 18 years old when I stepped into radio.  Uh-huh.  And it turns out I just can't cut it as a, as a voice guy.  Just don't have that voice for commercials.  Right, right.  But I did give it, uh, the old college try, and, uh, I, I have found over the years that I get less and less commercial work when I work for a radio station. 
[01:06:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I wonder why.  Not for, not for lack of trying it.  Oh, no.  I know all the skills I learned in college and over the years, I, I, I put to good use, but it turns out, like, the sales department, just, just not into my voice, I guess.  Well, I guess.  So, uh, after the show, I, I could go home right at seven because I have no commercial, uh, yeah, commercials to cut, as they say in the biz.  Now, uh, what, why would you think I get so upset, the numerous outtakes we have of me screwing up, uh, I get so upset because I kind of want to do a good job on some of these. 
[01:06:30]  Even though it's kind of ridiculous and everything, if it is my voice and stuff and I have to do it, I would want to do kind of a good job.  Sure.  At least.  Sure.  Um, the, the last spot you did before the show today.  What?  Is a complete abomination.  What are you talking about?  What are you guys, what are you guys, what are you guys?  What are you telling you, you had to do this spot.  What do you guys got?  For, uh, a week or two.  Right.  You kept saying, no, I'm not going to do it. 
[01:07:00]  Right.  Psycho Mark ratted you out to the boss.  Yeah.  The boss comes in and says, oh, just go in and please do it.  Yeah.  Uh, Psycho Mark did tattle on me.  Yeah.  I wasn't ratting.  You tattled.  F you, jerk.  I wasn't ratting.  I'm going to cover my ass.  How many times did you come to me and say, I need you to do this commercial?  Five or six.  At least.  And each time I said to you.  And he went, I didn't feel good because I didn't feel good.  No, I didn't say I didn't feel good.  But I said, be honest. 
[01:07:30]  I said, I just don't want to do it.  Do it.  You were just like, no, do it.  No, I drove Psycho Mark nuts to the point where he's pulling his hair out of his head and stuff.  And then he went to the boss and told.  So then I had to do the spot.  No, no, no.  I went to the boss and explained to him that the spot will not be on the air because there's a certain air talent at the station that feels too mighty to do it.  It's not that I feel too mighty.  Oh, no.  I just know I just don't have that voice for, you know, doing commercials.  Right it?  Well, you could. 
[01:08:00]  Right it?  You could.  What?  But there's a way he gets out of it.  What?  He does this.  He's done it before.  He does it again.  You know what he does?  He reads the commercial in such a way that no one in their right mind will ever say, I want Opie to do a commercial.  And the spot he just recorded is a perfect example of that.  We'll play it for you.  And then you're just going to hear it in rotation.  Like this will be a commercial.  You will hear it played on this station.  All right. 
[01:08:30]  Until the sponsor pulls it.  And I'm willing to play the commercial I just cut.  Okay.  For you decide.com.  Yes.  You will hear professionalism.  Yeah.  You will hear me trying.  Oh.  Of course.  Oh.  Trying your best.  Right.  He walked out and goes, okay, watch this.  He walks out of the office.  I swear to God he came back.  Shut up.  Wait, you're going to get me in trouble.  Hey, hey.  He came back about a minute and a half later.  All right, all right.  You're back.  A minute and a half later.  You're back. 
[01:09:00]  You're back in the office.  So I left the office in.  I said, hey, I have some business.  I got to cut a spot.  You came back so fast.  One take.  They used to call him Slappy up in Massachusetts.  I swear to God.  They used to call him Slappy.  I would be there to record a commercial.  Let's say it was for a motorcycle company.  Yeah.  I would get CDs of motorcycle sound effects and little other things that would enhance  the spot, some cool driving music behind it, and do a few takes on the read to make it 
[01:09:30]  sound energetic and fun and kind of, you know, kind of spice it up.  Yeah, it had all sorts of motorcycle sounds.  Right.  So after the show, I'd go in and my little box would be full of copy to do spots.  But all of a sudden, I was the production guy.  Because you did such a good job.  And Opie's box was empty.  He might have had, he may have had like, Opie, do this dub.  A dub is when you get a tape, it's already done, and you just have to put it on the cart, 
[01:10:00]  which is the medium we use here to run the commercial.  To play the spot.  Not have to utter a word.  You have to transfer a tape.  You do it at home if you're dubbing a tape off for your friend.  That's what his responsibility was.  And you've got to make it even clearer for the audience.  Because you were so motivated when we first started working together.  Well, it was my first real radio job, so I wanted to make a good impression.  I was learning the equipment.  First, we were doing it on tape, and then I got the digital workstation.  I was really psyched and pumped to learn how to do it and really see what I could do with this stuff. 
[01:10:30]  So I would pour myself into these spots.  And they would give you a spot and say, you know.  I'd do voices on them.  Do your best.  And you would do the spot.  You would spend an hour on a 60-second spot, right?  Yeah, sometimes it would be an hour to really make it sound very good.  And the guy that had to, you know, hand out this work, he loved your work so much  that he just kept giving you more and more and more and more.  And what people got out of the chair is one of my commercials was nominated for an Air Award in Massachusetts. 
[01:11:00]  Remember that?  Yes, I did.  My read for that head shop or whatever it was.  Yeah.  So, and the drag is, because after you do a radio show, you know, when you're off the air at 7,  you want to go right home.  Yeah.  And you would check your production box and see, oh, oh, oh.  Commercial work.  Oh, oh.  So I figured out a long time ago how to get out of it.  You just don't sound good.  Slappy.  They called him Slappy.  Why?  He would slap these together so fast.  And it wasn't just like now. 
[01:11:30]  We walk in and we pick up the tape and we read it.  Mark does all the work.  Psycho Mark.  We just have to read it into the mic.  Yeah.  Back in Massachusetts, we would have to put everything together.  We would record the music separate, all on different tracks and then mix it and bounce  it down onto the cart.  I mean, it was, it was work.  Right.  And they called him Slappy because he would slap it together.  Sometimes the music was so loud you couldn't hear what he was saying.  He would slur through words.  It was the worst thing.  Sometimes the 60, it would only come out to be 45 seconds. 
[01:12:00]  And if it did, you would have to do it again and maybe stretch it.  Maybe like double a few words in a dramatic fashion, using some effect.  Or if we'd just slap it together, write 45 on it and throw it.  He didn't care.  Slappy.  The funny part about it is because at that time, I was in radio a lot longer than you.  Right.  You would bend through that.  So I just learned the loopholes, let's say.  And it was so funny.  Every night at 7 o'clock, when we first got to Boston, they didn't know what was going  on.  So our production boxes would be even.  We both had three or four commercials to do. 
[01:12:30]  And then eventually, your pile would get huge.  It would be like a foot high, two feet high, and I would have nothing in my bin.  Opie would, I swear, would just have one little reel-to-reel tape and a cart.  Put what's on reel-to-reel on cart.  Thank you.  And that's all Opie would do.  And even that, it wasn't queued upright.  Like you'd hit it, you'd hit it, and like there'd be dead air for a second.  Then the commercial would come in.  Or he'd record over the splice.  He'd not even care.  So, but it took you a while to catch on, because we would, the cart would be bulk. 
[01:13:00]  You'd have two commercials running on the same thing.  It wasn't that bad.  But it took you a while to catch on, Anthony.  Right.  You'll be honest about that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  We would leave the show at 7 and check our commercial boxes, and I'd be like, oh, wow,  man, I have nothing to get.  Oh, it looks like you're going to be here until midnight.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it.  No, when we got here, to our N.E.W., we really didn't have to do production anymore. 
[01:13:30]  No.  Which was very nice.  But as more sponsors came on to the Opie and Anthony show and wanted more of the personal  touch of Opie and Anthony added into their spots, we were being brought into production  to do some reads.  Not put the spots together, but just do the live reads.  Right.  Which is fine.  So, Opie starts getting like, hey, screw this.  I'm a busy man tactic that got him the name Slappy. 
[01:14:00]  Wait till you hear them.  Pondering.  I put a lot of effort into this commercial.  Dude, I almost asked myself laughing so hard, I couldn't actually believe that you were reading  it in this particular way.  Oh, yeah.  This is my style.  Do you understand?  Well, it's a new style, man.  Let me tell you.  This is my delivery.  It's the delivery.  Everyone has a very special delivery.  This one's called Quaalude. 
[01:14:30]  Mark, how long did it take from the time you turned on the mic and me leaving your studio?  Ben, what's the time on the card?  Minute nine.  There you go.  That's how long it took.  Minute nine.  Maybe a second more for you to breathe.  I hope he's too busy doing lunch and firing people.  Shut up.  You always know.  Shut up.  It's my secret identity.  Cut it out.  But you should have seen his face when he walked in the studio. 
[01:15:00]  He's like, nope.  Hit record.  Turn it on.  Turn it on.  Give me the mic.  Where's the copy?  He's like, watch this.  Did he?  Now, you know, when I go in there, I like to read through the copy at least once.  Nope.  Nope.  No.  Cold read.  No, for sake.  Boom.  That's it.  He's the Ed Wood of radio.  Right here.  You should have seen his eyes.  Cut.  He has the sickest look on his face.  He's like, watch this.  And he's just got these evil effing eyes.  And he's just like, that's it.  Boom.  Pick something.  Cold copy. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, of course.  All I have to say is my work speaks for itself, Anthony.  It absolutely does.  You can say what you want, but it's very clear after you hear this fine read, I'll be doing  a hell of a lot more cool.  Oh, I'm sure.  I'll be doing reads in the Gonzo style, I believe.  There goes this account.  So, you want to play this?  Yeah.  Let's listen to Opie's fantastic read, foryoudecide.com.  This is a free spot, by the way. 
[01:16:00]  They're not scheduled to run right now.  Oh, of course.  Throwing them a bone, are you, Opie?  And you'll notice, what a guy.  What a bone.  You'll notice my use of sound effects.  Oh, really?  And music to spice up the read, Anthony.  All right?  All right?  Let's hear.  That's why you hear music behind the live reads and the sound effects, just to spice it  up.  Sure.  Keep you interested.  Here it is.  Youdecide.com.  I have a friend who's buying a house.  He asked me if I knew where he should get a loan.

[01:18:00]  Harry, this has been hot.  You only stole my board.  Oh, my God.  Lisa, who works in sales upstairs.  Are you for real with that?  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  You ever read one of my clients' copy like that?  I fear you.  There you go.  It works perfect.  See, look.  It works perfect.  That was terrible.  How many salespeople are going to be asking me to do live reads in the next month, Anthony?  I will do a live read. 
[01:18:30]  Don't you worry.  Listen to this.  Stephen Wright checking in.  Sounds great to me.  Anthony, don't be caught in this crap.  What?  This is how he does it.  Well, let me tell you something.  You ever do that to me, I'll kill you.  And you will do my live read.  All right.  Oh.  If you're into my new style, then bring it on.  Goodbye, guys.  This new style.  Hey, that's your new style?  Yeah.  That's how you're doing every read.  I've been working on it for a while.  That's the debut of my new style. 
[01:19:00]  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, Jeff.  Yeah.  What's up?  I like that new format of commercial you have.  Thank you.  That was on helium.  Unbelievable.  It is unbelievable.  What a professional broadcaster.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Bye.  And we're for real, man.  I mean, the commercial's labeled and everything.  It's in the commercial rack.  Oh, no.  You will hear that one.  Because that's it.  That's what Opie gives.  He gives till he can give no more. 
[01:19:30]  He walked out of that studio wiping his brow.  Woo.  I can't go on.  I'm just waiting for that call to be the movie guy, Anthony.  Yeah.  Oh, like the movie guy?  Yeah, that travels around in a limo.  New from Paramount Pictures.  Yeah, that's that guy?  Yeah.  I'm going to take over it for him soon.  It started in a small town.  The horror of that.  You know what a lot of people are saying you sound like? 
[01:20:00]  Who?  Do you like having your background?  We need a better version of that, by the way.  Send it to us.  Yeah, that was a little too fuzzy.  All right, Anthony.  So that was wonderful.  Thank you.  Very nice.  I'm sure you'll just be flooded now with other sponsors that want the new Opie Gonzo style.  You've got to admit, it worked perfectly, though.  It certainly did.  It took 30 seconds for one of the salesgirls from upstairs to call in and say, you know, 
[01:20:30]  you're not doing hurrieds like that.  Right.  Great.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's going on?  That commercial, I swear, it felt like it took me for an hour off my mic.  That was incredible.  You guys rule.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  People think we're joking.  We're not joking at all.  This is it.  Annie, what's up?  That was the most horrible read that I've ever heard.  You know what?  I agree with the other guy. 
[01:21:00]  I'm surprised you didn't start talking about Beba.  Yeah, but see, everyone, it's working.  BebaDecide.com.  You're not going to forget YouDecide.com now because they'll find new style.  Right?  Of course.  Uh-oh.  We might be in trouble.  Judy, who's in charge of all the sales girls.  Yeah.  And guys upstairs.  Judy?  Yeah?  It's Ope.  How are you?  Hey, Ope.  That was beautiful.  I think you should do your whole show like that, and that way your ratings will match our revenue. 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  It was fabulous.  Thank you.  Do you hear the sarcasm, Ope?  No.  I think it's great, and I think you should do your whole show like that.  You'll have Ben Stein on every day, and we'll find you some other special guests.  The Ope and Anthony show.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, and we'll have ratings and revenue to max like we did a couple years ago.  1-0-2-7.  Thank you, Judy.  Yeah.  And E-W. 
[01:22:00]  Thank you, Judy.  Well, thank you, guys.  Have fun.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Jay, checking in from Wanto, I just had to drink.  Ope just did spaz his voice.  Kind of close.  Paul.  Yeah, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, for those of us playing the O&A drinking game, Ope just did an imitation of James Earl Jones.  You recognize it.  James Earl Jones.  Go down, baby.  Yeah.  Have a good day.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  There you have it.  The debut of my new commercial reel.  New style.  There you go. 
[01:22:30]  You'll be hearing that sweeping the country, probably.  I'm guessing other jocks and voice people are going to start adopting that style and take it.  They're going to steal your voice.  I wouldn't be surprised, Andy.  Elmira.  I just want to say, Ope, you sounded so dead, but that was the funniest thing I've ever heard.  Oh, she liked it.  Oh, thank you, Elmira.  Well, I don't think it was supposed to be funny.  This better not backfire on me, and then all of a sudden I get a ton of commercials now.  Yeah, see?  They're going to start liking that style. 
[01:23:00]  That wouldn't be good.  And then all of a sudden they'll notice YouDecide.com is just getting pounded.  Do you know something, people?  Pound YouDecide.com.  No, no, no, no, no.  And if there's anything on that site that says, how did you find out about us?  Opie from the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie's fantastic live read.  Go right now.  YouDecide.com.  All right.  All of a sudden you'll be going, oh, you've got to do that voice, that read.  It's fabulous. 
[01:23:30]  Did you learn your reads at the Iona School of Broadcasting?  Come on, man.  Hey, I fell asleep a minute.  Did you play the spot?  Tom Brokenjaw is checking in.  He wants me to fill in for him tonight on NBC Nightly News.  He probably should.  Muhammad Ali wants me to do his commercials for him.  Take all fog on.  Float like a cinder block, sting like a marshmallow.  And Matt from Red Bank wants me to do his read for his company. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, see?  Look, they're all coming in.  Was that the HAL 9000 line of commercials?  Tom from Teenick.  Holy S, I just heard Opie's read on Z100.  They're already taking it.  You're going to be like a national guy now.  Very, very flattered.  Thank you.  Wonderful.  All right.  He done abusing me?  No, I can't.  After the sports guys and before Opie and Anthony, Leslie Gold is the radio chick.

All right.  We're talking about King Gimp.  We just saw the automatic door scene.  My God.  Paul.  He's trying to get through an automatic door.  And it opens up.  But he can't get through it before it closes again. 
[01:27:30]  And he's like up against it and just totally freaking out.  His arms and legs will flail in his head.  Oh.  Ron from Jersey.  If he couldn't stay in his chair at the Oscars because he was happy, can you imagine what he would look like rubbing one out?  He would be flying around the room with his junk in his hand like a fire hose going full blast with no one holding it.  Yeah.  And everyone's talking about the popcorn scene.  They're queuing that one up for us there.

An actual quote lifted from the tape in King Gimp's own voice.  And he's actually saying something.  Yes.  We were going to have it where you just had to guess what he said.  Yeah.  But it would be impossible.  It would be impossible.  So we will give you multiple choice.  Correct, Anthony.  Sounds like it's easy, doesn't it?

[01:36:30]  All right.  Let's play the clip.  Of course he said, of course he said they wanted to kill me when I was born, but I was  bouncing so much the doctors couldn't catch me.

[01:53:00]  Ron Reagan, American badass.  Remember that?  When he took over from Carter, who was just like, you know, running the country into the ground?  He's such a pussy.  And then all of a sudden...  But Reagan, he didn't give a flying F what anyone said.  He had his policies.  He enacted them.  And he didn't care what anyone said.  You know what?  These guys are so wishy-washy on both ends.  God damn.  Like him or hate him, I would have to say Reagan was the last real leader in this country.  And who knows how much he actually led, but at least he made a good figurehead. 
[01:53:30]  There you go.  You know, at least you were getting the illusion that this guy was in charge.  I don't care.  Another couple of years go by, and they're going to remember Bill Clinton for a hummer in the white.  A hummer in the white house.  That's all.  Believe me.  All the good stuff.  And yeah, we've had eight years of prosperity.  It's been really nice and everything.  But 20, 30, 40 years down the road, oh yeah, Bill Clinton, the B.J. president.  I remember him.  Remember Reagan, though?  He got in office.  The Iranians gave back all the hostages the next day.  That was it. 
[01:54:00]  It's like, okay, we understand this guy.  That was a big change, whether you liked it or not.  At least there was something changed.  People realized he was out of his mind.  And he didn't have all of his mind.  Remember Reagan's little guffaw on the mic?  The bombing starts in five minutes.  God damn, what a set of nuts on that guy.  He's over a satellite that's beamed everywhere.  And he talks about the Russians.  The bombing starts.  Who is this on?  Just there.  I love that.  He doesn't even joke about that.  He doesn't even joke about it. 
[01:54:30]  He doesn't even joke about it.  All these missiles are sitting there, rumbling, waiting to launch each other.  They rumbled for like eight straight years.  And the Russians, did he just say the bombing starts in five minutes?  You know, they were probably like on the phone or just watching it.  What did he say?  They rocked.  The goddamn guy can take a bullet, too.  Let's not forget.  Cancer, he shot.  Look at that.  That's a leader.  He's got to deal with that wife of his.  The guy now has no brain left, and he still goes around.  He's like Spock.  When they took Spock's brain out, he just walks around. 
[01:55:00]  But goddamn, he's still kicking.  I picture a shield high above the Earth that will protect us from enemy missiles.  We're calling it Star Wars.  And I was like, what?  Wow, Star Wars.  I saw the movie.  It's great.  Now this guy wants to build that stuff.  This man's fantastic.  And you were amazed because at home all you're doing is playing Pong,  and this guy has this vision of Star Wars.  I'm like, goddamn. 
[01:55:30]  That will eliminate incoming missiles.  What?  Wait, let me.  This is great.  Like Missile Command?  It's like Missile Command, Ronnie Reagan, right?  He was just playing.  Whatever.  He was just playing Atari at home.  It was a great grand idea.  Mommy, look at this game.  If we can, well, get this around the world.  Imagine all of a sudden, you know, Russian missiles coming.  Look, Mommy, I got the high score. 
[01:56:00]  Me, one, Russians, nothing.  Yes.  I picture a big yellow ball with a mouth eating the Russians, going whack-a-whack-a-whack-a.  And then, if it gets far from a base, there'll be power pills.  And it will eat inky and binky and binky.  That's what I picture.  I picture.  Yes.  Depending on whatever game he gets. 
[01:56:30]  I picture a missile defense system that hits the missiles back and forth and goes,  bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.  And the first one to win, miss with a paddle.  Who is?  Yes.  Hello?  You just heard the sound from NORAD.  We are victorious.  I picture a defense system where a giant gorilla throws barrels at the Russians as they hop on a conveyor belt. 
[01:57:00]  Our Italian allies will help with Mario.  They will jump around, trying not to get eaten by plants and whatnot.  My defense system is a frog that tries to jump across a crowded street.  Goddamn, is that funny.  Goddamn Reagan. 
[01:57:30]  You've got to love him, though.  Hell yeah.  You know what's great, too, about his idea?  Is that they came up with all the graphics.  Oh, the graphics are great.  You see, like, the missile launch in space.  This big retro rocket with fire and this can-shaped thing with launch a laser beam.  You're like, oh, this is fantastic.  This is effing beautiful, man.  That was 20 years ago.  Yeah.  What do we got now?  Nothing.  If Ronnie was still in, forget it.  With the video games out now? 
[01:58:00]  I picture a defense system where you drive a car through the streets of New York and hit everything and nothing happens.  Our cities will be as indestructible as those games.  I'm appointing Lara Croft, head of our defense system.  Because she's a bad bitch.  Yes.  O.B.  Anthony. 
[01:58:30]  W.N.E.W.  W.N.E.W.  Five shows.  Boys, guys.  Morning.  I'm 10 to 2.  It's me.  Leslie Gold, the radio chair.  Hey, it's the most fun you can have without using your hands.  It's Russell Permanent.  Afternoons.  It's O.B. and Anthony.  Two to seven.  Ben at seven.  I was watching the MTV Movie Award. 
[01:59:00]  That blew it off.  So bad.  So friggin' bad.  They had that Sarah Jessica Parker hosting.  She was horrible.  Ruth Buzzy in a dress.  Her face is looking like Ruth Buzzy.  And she's, like, parading around.  She kept doing costume changes every, like, five minutes, you know?  She'd come out in a new dress.  And she's showing off like she's all hot and everything.  But, you know, you keep those clothes on.  Exactly.  In L.A. Store and a few years after that. 
[01:59:30]  Her boobage were getting, like, all flat.  And, like, it just wasn't working for me.  The last few years have not been kind to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Not working for me.  And then everybody that was there, like all the big celebrities that show up for the MTV Movie Awards,  they're just there to hawk their movies.  That's all.  They had Samuel Jackson talking about Shaft.  He's wearing a Shaft hat.  He's up there Shaft this, Shaft that, MRF-er.  They had to bleep every other word he said.  And then they had, uh, what's-his-facey there?  It's in The Patriot.  Oh, uh, uh, Mel Gibson. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Mel Gibson.  Mel Gibson.  I'm on first-name basis with him, eh?  Mel.  Yeah, Mel.  Mel.  Mel.  Mel-y Mel.  Got him because he's got a movie coming out.  Oh, a bunch of crap.  Anybody that didn't have a movie coming out wasn't going to, uh, do the movie award.  And it was obvious.  They were just there to hawk-hawk their movies.  There were no highlights at all.  Nothing.  It was boring as hell.  Boring.  Adam Sandler came out and read a little acceptance thing, like, uh, that was written from the kid 
[02:00:30]  from, uh, Big Daddy.  Uh-huh.  And that was mildly amusing until it really started going too long.  He always goes too long.  And that was it.  On those award shows.  That was it.  Like, that was the, the highlight, if you could even call it that.  Who do we have on the line?  Hey, you want to talk about the MTV Video Awards?  Dude, this thing sucked.  It was so bad.  I know.  I mean, I thought the South Park skit would save it.  It sucked too.  Yeah.  It was kind of funny when the gladiator killed Kenny.  Um, they're like, wait a minute.  Timmy was in there. 
[02:01:00]  Hey.  And then Timmy was in there.  Eh.  Timmy.  Oh, really?  They really tried to play that Sarah Jessica Parker thing off like it was going to be funny.  But it's just so bad.  She was so bad.  And she can't talk, like, naturally.  It was obvious that she's reading from cue cards.  And all the, the MTV thing was supposed to be, like, the hip alternative to award shows.  And, and they, they all act like they're, uh, like it's the Oscars or something.  They're reading off the teleprompters.  They, they can't, uh, carry on a conversation with each other.  It was ridiculous.  The first few years of the, the MTV Movie Awards were pretty good. 
[02:01:30]  It was cool.  You didn't know it was going to happen.  Now it's structured and it's like every other award show.  It sucks.  They think it's like, oh, we're hip.  Look, the presenters come down on a slide from the back of the thing.  Wow.  That's cool.  That's different than the Oscars.  And then they step up to the podium and start giving the same long-winded, dopey-ass speeches.  It used to be the anti-award show.  Now it's, uh, yeah, it's just another award show.  It's too bad.  It sucks.  Ha ha.  All right, man. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, thanks, bro.  All right, cool.  Sarah Jessica Parker.  Hey.  Hey.  Who's this?  You're not Sarah Jessica Parker.  Oh, these are the fellas that were just, uh, trashing me.  Are these the guys?  Are you Sarah Jessica Parker?  I am indeed.  Now, how do you prove that?  How do I prove it?  I don't know.  How does one prove their, um, identity with the phone?  It does sound a lot like you.  I gotta say that.  Do you listen to our radio show?  No, I don't.  As a matter of fact, my trailer driver had it on and I was fortunate. 
[02:02:30]  The timing was absolutely, absolutely beautifully fortuitous for me.  Sarah Jessica, I gotta say, your performance on the MTV Movie Awards, fantastic.  I thought you did a great job.  I loved the costume changes, especially the one at the end.  You're such a puss, man.  What?  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  You don't have the balls to actually say to me what you said to your maybe limited audience?  Come on, buddy.  Limited audience?  Come on.  We have a...  We get more people listening to this show than watching that Sex and the City. 
[02:03:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Hey, I...  Are you certain of that?  Positive.  I watched the...  What's the...  Hey, guys, listen, listen.  I watched the...  Take it easy.  It's all right.  You're absolutely entitled to an opinion.  I just thought it'd be...  I just thought it...  Maybe I'd put a human face to, uh, you know, some trash talk and I thought it'd be helpful  to you to actually make it less abstract and more of a person.  I thought...  I thought you were really hot in L.A. Story.  Hello?  That means the world to me.  Thank you.  Thanks. 
[02:03:30]  So what do you guys do?  You're DJs on the air in New York City?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Your chat show host?  Yeah, that's all we do.  We're not as famous as you or anything.  No.  You know.  But listen, what I wanted to do, what I actually wanted to do, because I actually don't know  you guys and I don't actually listen to the radio only because I don't have time, not  because I'm an elitist or I think I'm above it.  Why don't you put...  I simply don't listen to the radio that much.  Yeah.  But what I thought I might do, since you've hurt my feelings so terribly, and since I actually  am a person with feelings, and you seem to have an idea about me that I'm sort  of hideous and awful... 
[02:04:00]  What?  Where do I go?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What do I do?  Let me finish.  What does she want to do?  Let me have mine.  What do you want to do?  What I do is I would invite you to the set, if you're interested in comedy, from shooting  in New York City, as you know, with our tiny little audience show called Sex and the  City, which is just bigger than ever.  I saw the season premiere, and I enjoyed the whole Staten Island thing you guys did this  past week.  Thank you.  Well, thanks.  That's big of you.  Thank you.  What I do is, if you guys are brave enough, I thought perhaps you might want to come to  the set and pay a visit and actually see that I'm not a deformed, awful looking person. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, my...  Wait, wait, wait.  And he did it actually, especially, when you forced me to toot my own horn, and I will  say this.  We didn't take a bad part.  I have never been one that has been accused of being stilted in her speaking.  I have made numerous appearances on Letterman for God knows how many years.  Sarah, you seemed a little stiff.  Sarah...  I'd hardly be accused of being a stiff person.  Wait, we're just two...  Let me just...  Let me just...  We're just two schmucks on the radio.  Let her finish.  What does it matter what we say? 
[02:05:00]  Let her finish.  We have personal...  We have personal taste.  That's all.  I think it's a rather daunting experience to be the host of an award show when one has  not made a living, nor practice of doing that.  And I think that perhaps if you met me, you might actually discover that you like me.  You might actually be on my side.  Do you want to come down today?  We're...  No, no, no.  I want 18 hours a day.  I think you have to come here.  I think that's the best you can do with men is to tod your little feet down to my set.  Come visit me and say hello.  Oh, look.  Now she made me feel all bad. 
[02:05:30]  I know.  You should.  You should.  You guys take pot sauce, and you don't realize we're people.  They only got...  You were asked to do something.  Would you turn...  Would you say no to the...  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me tell you something.  Let me tell you something.  We didn't say you were hideous or anything.  Yes, you did.  It's not...  Really?  We just said...  Yes, you absolutely, without question, inferred that, calling me Ruth Buzzy, calling me old.  I thought it was quite flattering when I said you're starting to look like Ruth Buzzy.  You damn people aren't supposed to listen to these goddamn shows.  Do you really think whoever you are, whichever one you are, you really think that calling 
[02:06:00]  somebody Ruth Buzzy is a flattering comment?  You need to get out more often, my friend.  It's called humor.  We're just trying to have fun.  You think people that heard that comment really go, oh, yeah, she's looking like Ruth Buzzy.  What do you look like?  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  We're heinous.  I imagine you are, and so you're still laughing out with rage.  That's what it is.  With rage you are.  Come on, boys.  Come on to the set one day.  We're two just, you know, radio talk show hosts.  You shouldn't...  Don't be scared of me.  You shouldn't...  Don't be scared of me.  I'm not scared.  You're going to have Matthew...  I'm going to have Matthew punch us in the nose. 
[02:06:30]  Matthew is so above punching you two in the nose.  Wow, we got to you.  Who are we?  You're like a big, famous Hollywood star.  You're just two vocal shots.  People actually are real people with feelings, and they work really hard.  And granted, am I a flawless person?  But no, do I go and fix it and become some day else?  I'm not.  That's who I am.  All right.  Can we play What's in Sarah Jessica Parker's Pants right now?  It's a game we play.  I think it would be a good way to break the ice and make peace. 
[02:07:00]  You take the phone and rub it on your most intimate of areas, and we guess how you're groomed.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes.  Let me ask you a question.  I can't believe we got you.  I'm thinking...  You're delighted to know...  You just made my day.  Aren't you guys kind of delighted to know that when you actually trash someone, that there's  actually a person listening and they have to be...  No, I hate that.  I hate that.  We're going to have to reevaluate...  Does it kind of make you feel badly?  We're going to have to reevaluate the entire program now.  It kind of makes you feel like crap, doesn't it?  Honestly, no, it doesn't.  It's so easy to do. 
[02:07:30]  No, Sarah, Sarah, if you'll let us talk, it doesn't change my opinion at all.  I don't care.  We're just trying to have fun and make people laugh.  We're just two local shock jocks.  You're a Hollywood star, and we got to...  I'm not a Hollywood star.  I'm a New Yorker.  I've lived there my whole life.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm a working actress.  That's what I am.  You're not...  But I dig.  I dig that you put me on the air.  Yeah.  I dig that you put me on the air, and I'm not saying you're not entitled to the first  thing I said.  I just want you to know there's a person.  There's a person attached.  Are you going to cry?  No.  You won't cry. 
[02:08:00]  Maybe secretly we think you're really hot, and we're frustrated that we can't get you.  You guys want to come visit me?  Or no?  We can't have sex with you or something.  We'll come visit you as well.  I'm sorry.  Don't go overboard.  You guys want to come visit?  I'll come visit you as long as you don't get us beat up or anything.  No, I just want you to meet the crew, and I want you to meet everybody that I work with  Oh, that's going to just be ugly.  And then we'll get all beat up.  That's going to be ugly.  Why not come and be in my environment?  Come on, fellas.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere?  Mutual territory?  Yes.  Like Sweden?  Man, I'm starting to like you all of a sudden.  Like Sweden?  She's feisty.  You're feisty. 
[02:08:30]  I like that.  Well, unattractive women tend to be feisty.  No, Ruth Fuzzy never gave me a boner.  You do.  Okay?  Oh, please, fellas.  Don't try to backpedal that much.  No, we're not backpedaling.  You're getting on a good side.  I wanted you to know that there's actually a human being connected with you guys.  I know it's funny, and I know it's charming, and it's amusing to the listeners, and I've  laughed at names in the past, too.  But I just want you to know there's a person.  That's all.  Opie's the mean one.  I'm nice.  I don't know which one's which, and I sort of don't care, because you guys sort of did 
[02:09:00]  a tag team thing.  No, you care, because you called in.  I do care.  I do care what you said.  So you just heard our voices in the background in between, you know, filming Sex and the  City, and went, oh, my God, they're talking about me?  Where were you when you heard us trashing you?  We're sitting downtown on Chamber Street in the surrogate court building, which means  I'm surrounded by authority.  Right.  So anyway, I have to go to the set.  They're calling me to the set.  But I just wanted to...  Can we have all our listeners bring down flowers to apologize or something?  I want you to bring down flowers. 
[02:09:30]  They didn't do anything wrong.  They're just happy listeners.  Trust me.  I think...  Right?  Huh?  No, they're on our side.  They all feel the same way.  You feel Jesus.  No, no, no, no.  Someone on line nine is calling us pussies.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You can't win.  Because now we're back, Kyle.  Listen, thank you.  Thank you for letting me call.  You're men for listening.  I appreciate it.  And I'm dead serious when I say come down to the set and visit.  You don't have to come today.  We're shooting until mid-August.  We're here in New York City.  Could you hold on?  Our producer will just get info.  If you could just give it to somebody on that end, we'll try to figure something out.  I look forward to meeting you. 
[02:10:00]  And I secretly do watch Sex and the City, even though I can't admit it on the radio show.  It's kind of a chick show.  No, it's not, man.  And you are the hottest on the show.  The blonde I don't like at all.  She was naked in the firehouse this week.  These are the people I work with.  I dig her.  I dig her.  Yeah, but I...  She's trash talking to me.  I'm not going to jump on your side.  No, but I'm just giving my opinions again.  All right, but don't be careful.  She was naked through that whole first episode, and I wasn't feeling it.  I was hoping you were going to get naked with that politician.  I'll never get naked.  I never have, and I never will.  No?  Yeah, it was pretty close last night on the movie award. 
[02:10:30]  All right, why don't you just get the information so I can go to set and not get fired?  Okay.  All right, thanks, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  There she goes, Sarah Jessica Parker, calling in.  Well, you know, she's got some balls there.  Comes calling up and defending herself.  Man, this show has come a long way.  You know, it used to be safe where we could trash people and it never gets back to them.  Yeah.  I think our audience is getting too big.  Yeah, we got to leave this thing.  Like, if we were in Tallahassee, you know, no one would care. 
[02:11:00]  They go line to Sarah Jessica Parker.  I'm like, there's no way it's Sarah Jessica Parker.  It's Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yelling at us.  Opie.  Yeah.  You should be a little nicer next time.  The scary thing?  I bet you we go down there and we see her and we just go, oh, my God, she's knockout gorgeous.  She's so hot.  Yeah.  You know?  Oh.  She just made us eat crow, practically.  Screw the rat.  Yeah, I know.  It's so hard to just, because everyone can call up and say, you guys are pussies. 
[02:11:30]  Why don't you, you know, it's one thing to say stuff on the air.  It's another when they call up and call you on it to, like, keep going.  I think we held our own, though.  I didn't write down too much.  No, I totally pussied out.  I've got to be honest with you.  I don't know.  Oh, wow.  I totally pussied out.  I do like it when her hair is down.  When she pulls it back, it's not as sexy. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  But we love Sex and the City, right, Ant?  It's one of my favorite shows.  I can't believe you're addressing her.  Hey, are there any other celebrities listening today?  We'd love to hear from you.  And we'll give you our opinion on you.  Yeah, and then you could rub it in our face.  Right.  God, we're just two dopey, like, local talk show guys, and we got to, like, a Hollywood starlet.  Oh.  With our stupid opinions, Anthony.  Made it feel bad.  Yeah, see?  And I'll go on record to say Ant and I are nothing to look at. 
[02:12:30]  We know that.  We never sit here on the radio and say, hey, you know, GQ called, and they want us for a photo shoot.  But I'll tell you one thing.  If MTV Movie Awards called and wanted me to host, I wouldn't be strutting around in clothes,  just trying to look all hot, you know.  You just didn't like the MTV Movie Awards, and she was what, the host?  She was the host, yeah.  And I think, and they still said she came across as a little stiff, I'll be.  Okay.  A little stiff. 
[02:13:00]  Any other celebrities like to call up today?  We'd love to talk to you.  In her defense, she said that she doesn't do that by trade, and she thought it would be  an exciting, fun thing to do, like, in hosting the MTV Movie Awards, so she did it.  And who am I to say that she came off as stiff, both?  I think all next week we dedicate the O&A show to Sarah Jessica Parker.  Yes.  It'll be the We Love You Sarah Jessica all week next week.  Okay.  We can do that.  We'll get a Skyrider, we'll put a heart up over Central Park, we'll get our listeners 
[02:13:30]  to send flowers down to the set, make up some bumpers, saying that this week is the Sarah  Jessica Parker Love Fest Week.  Love Fest Week.  Oh, boy.  I didn't feel bad, though.  If she's listening, I didn't.  We're just trying to have fun and have some, make people laugh.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I heard her voice, I knew that was her right away.  I felt guilty, man, for laughing at what you guys were saying.  I was like, holy mackerel. 
[02:14:00]  I know.  It's very rare someone calls us out on something, and I'm like, there's no way that Sarah Jessica  Parker will take time out of her busy day.  She just hosted the, you know, movie awards, even though they taped that a while ago, but  I'm sure she's doing press, post-press.  Yeah.  She's filming Sex and the City.  I'm like, there's no way she has time to call up because two wacky DJs in New York said  something bad about her.  It's like telling your buddies you're with this chick, and all of a sudden she walks  in a room and goes, oh, we just got smagged is what happened.  We got smagged.  We were called out, and I, for one, folded. 
[02:14:30]  I folded.  Oh, I hate that.  They're not supposed to be real people.  They're just cagged us.  Whatever.  Pete.  Yeah, you guys are such pussies.  You're tripping over your own tampon strings as you're backpedaling, you two little men.  Hey, I've got a good idea.  The next Sex and the City, maybe they can have all the girls bend you guys over and just 
[02:15:00]  rake the hell out of you women.  We'll be violated with strap-on devices on Sex and the City.  Sex and the City has become one of our favorite shows right behind Survivor.  What a mess.  They're not supposed to call.  Like, there's no way a lady's going to, like, imitate Sarah Jessica Parker well.  I could tell by the boy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Rick just had a...  Did you talk to her, or she put you on with someone else?  First, I got an earful from her.  What'd she say to you on the phone after we hung up with her?  She asked if I was proud to be working for you guys. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, God, see?  And I had to admit that, no, I wasn't.  Not at that particular moment.  Oh, you're a pussy girl.  Look at you.  Hey, I learned from you guys.  Oh, we got off on the wrong foot with Sarah Jessica Parker.  Now we're going to have to make it up to her.  I'll be honest, I don't have the balls to go down to the set of Sex and the City and meet  and confront me.  Oh, I'll have a bunch of hot chicks laughing at her.  Yeah, that's not emasculating at all.  Because we never claim to be freaking, you know, models or anything.  Oh, no.  And you know Matthew's going to be there. 
[02:16:00]  He's going to try to punch us in the nose because we trashed this woman.  Dude, can we get a couple of, like, GQ model guys to go down there as Opie and Anthony?  Come on.  Come on.  That's perfect.  We'll pay and they'll be dressed to the nines and stuff.  Right.  Welcome.  Hello.  I'm Opie.  I'm Anthony.  How are you?  Sorry, Jessica.  We've got to take a break, Anthony.  Okay.  All right.  212-757-1027.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Until I'm dancing.  1027-WNEW.  Dawn, what's going on?  You're next on WNEW.  Hey, guys.  What you doing?  Talking to you.  I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me out.  Okay.  I'm here at my boyfriend's house right now.  He's at work.  And he should be home pretty soon.  Yeah.  And what I wanted to do for him was surprise him with a really great night of sex, but also  do anal.  You're taking the big step, huh?  Well, we tried it once and it was a little bit painful for me. 
[02:17:00]  And I didn't know if you guys had any tips that maybe you've used in the past that maybe  I could let him know, because he's probably listening right now.  Or maybe you might be able to.  You've tried it before?  Yeah.  It didn't really work out the entire way.  What was the problem?  It hurt.  Okay.  Terrific.  It hurt.  Yeah.  It was just worth it as.  I just didn't know if there was just some way that you guys knew of just like making  it feel a little bit better.  I know it's going to hurt. 
[02:17:30]  Well, are you lubricating or anything?  Yeah, we use that, but I have a lot myself, so.  Yeah, see, that's, you know, I think you've got to work yourself up into a froth.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  I suggest you drink like a gallon of wine.  Any booze?  Is any booze coming into play?  Get some of that cheap box wine.  Oh, of course.  There's always wine here.  The wine in the box.  The $6 box?  Yeah.  Yeah, the expensive one.  And what is he doing?  Is he just kind of climbing a board and going to town? 
[02:18:00]  Well, you know, it's the whole four-flade business first.  No, I mean, right at the point of, you know, where he's ready to go.  I mean, does he, is he gentle?  Yes, he is.  He doesn't just like, you know, lunge into it or anything.  Have you tried like a shoehorn?  Is he a big man?  Bigger than average.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Maybe you just need different lubricants.  Maybe that could help.  You know.  So what happens?  It's just hurting a lot. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, it was just, it was just, it got to a point where there was just this one part,  like, yo, and, you know, then it was like, okay, I can't do this right now.  Oh, a little resistance?  Yeah.  Maybe you're not relaxing enough.  Maybe you're clenching up.  Yeah, that's why you got to get a little more relaxed, a little more wine.  Yeah.  You pretty much just got to suck it up.  You're almost there.  You're almost there.  Take the pain.  Take the pain.  Hey, are you going to be doing the anal before the end of the show?  Um, probably not.  Probably about seven.  Oh, damn.  I know.  He doesn't get out of work until seven. 
[02:19:00]  Hmm.  He'd love to have him on the phone while he tries.  I would do that.  I wouldn't mind it.  So, guys, I, oh!  Oh, yeah!  Okay, guys, I'm ready.  My boyfriend's going to attend right now.  I don't think we should have a problem.  I'm pretty lubricated.  Well, there's a lot of guys that want to give you advice on how to take it.  Okay.  I don't know.  This could get ugly. 
[02:19:30]  All right, we'll try one and see where it goes, okay?  All right.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, you're on with Don.  Hi, Don.  Hey, Joe.  What's up?  Not bad.  Listen, the only thing, when I introduce my ex-wife to it...  All right, Joe, be careful.  I want as much of this on the radio as possible.  No, I'll be, oh, it's perfect.  All right, yeah.  No problem.  When I introduce my ex-wife to it, instead of being up on all fours, on your back, with  your legs up.  With your legs way up.  Way up. 
[02:20:00]  Behind my ear?  Oh, if you can.  Like you're hanging meat.  I'm serious.  Yeah?  The ankle penetration's a lot better.  Okay.  I'll keep that in mind.  All right?  Well, thank you, Joe.  Oh, and hey, you're the best.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Well, Joe, give him some advice.  Let's see if another guy has some advice here, Anthony.  Let's go to Fred.  Fred, you're on with Dawn.  Hey, Dawn, how are you?  How are you doing all the day?  Hey, Fred, keep it between the lines so we can get this on the radio.  Do you have some advice for Dawn?  We're going to do our best here, guys.  Okay. 
[02:20:30]  Hey, listen, what I've found is the best way is on all fours for her, and what you have  to get her to do...  Dawn, you listening?  I am.  Okay, what you have to do is you've got to get all worked up for this, and then when  you reach the point when you guys are going to initiate the act, you have to keep on going.  You have to keep on touching yourself down there.  Do you follow what I'm saying here?  Yep.  Okay, because that's going to kind of take your mind off of it.  Is that possible? 
[02:21:00]  Okay.  It's going to keep you going where you're not going to mind.  It's going to make you puke.  All right, Fred, thank you.  All right.  Well, look, Dawn's getting all sorts of advice from my list, Anthony.  And you thought it was going to be so bad.  I want another lady to give you advice, though.  I mean, the guy advice thing.  I don't know if you're working as well.  Just lay there.  Hey, Steve, what's up?  Steve?  Hey, what's going on, man?  You're on with Dawn. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, Dawn, I agree with both of those guys.  That's right.  And you can't have it all like, you've got to be worked up, and you've really got to be  into it.  You know what I'm saying?  Mm-hmm.  And I tell you, the best lubrication is like spit your saliva.  I swear to God, if he's you out.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You can't say that, Steve.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  But you're having oral sex, and he just slowly works out a lot better.  And you've really got to just keep it going.  You know, keep yourself into it. 
[02:22:00]  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  All right, man.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Didn't know Sammy was into that.  Hey, Frank.  Yo, what's going on, fellas?  What's going on?  I think you've got to be the last caller.  We're in dangerous territory here.  All right, now I'm going to be real cool, real careful for you, all right?  There's a whole thing on the air, I promise.  All right, you're on with Dawn.  What's your name, Dawn?  Dawn, yeah.  Dawn, check it out.  There's a product on the market, no joke, swear to God, it's called Anal Ease.  Oh, I saw that down in the village.  No joke, it works, Dawn.  Now, I don't know from experience, but what the women told me underneath me, they said 
[02:22:30]  it didn't hurt as much.  Tell your man to take it slow and easy.  Okay, terrific.  Well, Dawn, what do you think?  I think it's going to go good.  Yeah?  Well, now there's a lady calling that wants to give you advice.  We've got to get one lady on to help you out.  Okay.  Vicki.  Vicki.  Yeah.  You got some advice for Dawn?  Yes, I do.  Okay.  Dawn?  Hey, Vic.  Hi, how you doing?  I'm good.  Those guys are giving you some bad advice.  Some of it's good, some of it's bad.  That up in the air, legs up in the air thing? 
[02:23:00]  No, that hurts.  No?  Very painful, that's no good.  As far as, you know, keeping the pleasuring with the finger going, that's good.  Okay.  That works.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The easiest way...  There is, Danny.  Sit down, Danny.  Lots of lubrication.  Yes.  Turn on your side.  How about a butt plug?  No.  I don't think that would work.  Danny?  Turn on your side. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  And that is what I found to be about the most enjoyable for you.  Some of the other ways can be incredibly painful.  All right.  Mary.  Mary, can I give you anal sex?  Please.  Please.  Please.  Mary.  Mary.  I need anal, Mary.  I think you do, Danny.  I've already asked Murr.  And Lou, Lou, Lou won't give me anal.  I'm leaving.  How about I just bend over Spalding? 
[02:24:00]  I'll get my f***ing like it.  Holly, what's up?  Hi, how you doing?  How are you?  Good.  You guys are great.  Hey, thank you.  Yeah.  I want to give Dawn some advice about the anal ease.  Yeah.  Okay.  Great stuff.  Yeah?  That's the only way I can take it.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  You know, you see these girls take it in the movies and stuff, and you're like, there's  no way.  But, yeah, you get it with the anal ease, and you take it like a pro.  Okay. 
[02:24:30]  Terrific.  Definitely got to pick that up.  You can pick that up.  An al ease.  An al ease, yeah.  Wow, popular item.  It is.  It's just great stuff.  Yeah, they have a whole bunch of it down there.  I think it's a little better if the girl goes in and makes the purchase, though.  I'll tell you the truth.  I need anal ease, please.  Mr. Farmer says, can I get some anal ease, please?  It's for me, Murray, and Lou.  I wonder if they have fist ease.  Sorry.  Just have him put a little bit on his finger. 
[02:25:00]  We're like...  All right.  We know how to apply.  A little on the...  No, because if you put it on the guy...  All right, all right, all right.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah, if you put it on the guy, it'll numb him.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, you don't want that.  Oh, is it like a numbing agent, too?  And a lubricant?  It's like the...  That's what you want.  Yeah, that's what you want in lovemaking.  Something that'll numb the pain.  Kind of like novocate.  I know that the few blows to the...  Usually loosens the area up and puts enough blood there to lubricate. 
[02:25:30]  That's what you want.  And then once you're there, and actually in the act of anal sex,  I know that some kidney punches usually make a clinch up, and it feels good.  And not as after-press charges if you punch them hard.  So remember, anal tips, drink a lot.  Don't fight back.  Bite the pillow.  And bleed a lot.  All right.  Thank you, Mike Tyson.  All right, Holly, thank you.  Thanks, Holly. 
[02:26:00]  Good luck, Don.  Thank you so much.  All right, bye.  Good luck.  Wishing each other well in the wonderful world of anal.  It's like a novocate for the butt.  Yeah.  I wonder if you get like, you know when you go to the dentist  and your lips get all numb and droopy?  I think it's just a different type of drilling.  Go ahead, rinse.  Valerie, what's going on?  Don has to lay on her stomach.  On her stomach.  On the side. 
[02:26:30]  You guys have all suggested lay on the stomach, lay on the back, lay on the side.  Do it all fours.  Not on all fours.  She's got her first day on her stomach until it's completely in.  Then get on all fours.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, there's a move when it's, uh...  Yeah, because it's easier to go in when you're on your stomach.  Yeah.  And you enjoy it more when you're on all fours.  All right.  Thank you, Valerie.  Thanks.  Okay.  I think we'll do one more.  Be sure the area's basted in a lot of rubricans.  That's how I like my anal. 
[02:27:00]  Be sure it's plenty of cake of turkey baster.  And just marinades the area.  Be sure it's properly marinades.  The leather Cheerio.  And lay on your stomach, gals, like a big, like a big turkey.  And then get stuffed like a holiday turkey.  And you baste the area of the leather Cheerio in lubricant.  Marinade. 
[02:27:30]  And then take the stuffing made of hot beef.  Stuff that turkey.  Just stuff the big, fat turkey.  That's well lubricated with the lubricant.  Monade.  Bon appétit with your anal.  Bon appétit.  That's right.  Only a properly lubricated monade. 
[02:28:00]  The moon nod will be pleasurable to all the people.  Look at the way I enjoy it with my big, fat, old ass.  It's usually best served with a tossed salad.  Hey, Karen, you guys.  And a fine wine.  Fine wine.  Come on, all juice in the area.  Bon appétit.  Oh, Karen, terrific.  Let me talk.  Hi, guys.  Hey, Karen, you got some advice for Dawn? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, actually, we need to just get KY Jelly from the drugstore.  KY.  Yeah.  That works with us.  KY.  And to be on all the...  KY Jelly or KY Jam.  And honestly, if you could just get her boyfriend hooked up, it'll be so quick that it doesn't  last you long.  Quick and famous is how I like it.  Okay.  Take a deep breath and it'll be over so fast.  All right.  Thank you, Karen.  You're welcome.  Bye, you.  Proper lubricant. 
[02:29:00]  I'll have something in a chicken base.  Or maybe some jam.  All right, Jody.  Strawberry preserved.  Hey, what's up, Jody?  How are you guys?  Very good.  All right, Dawn, I have some advice for you.  Okay, go.  You have to lay completely flat on your stomach.  Mm-hmm.  And stick your butt up in the air.  And actually push like you're trying to...  All right, all right.  All right, listen, listen, listen. 
[02:29:30]  Listen, we had to dump out of that.  You can't say that.  That's a wrong advice.  Maybe Julia Child could, like...  We understand that.  That's a wrong advice.  Julia Child, could you translate what didn't make it up?  Yes, let's say you're stuffing a holiday turkey.  It would help if the turkey felt like it was to push the stuffing back out.  Push.  And remember plenty of more and on. 
[02:30:00]  The only way it works is with more and on.  I know I used to enjoy anal a lot more, but the men seem to roll off of my hunchback these days.  You see my boobs?  Sweat socks full of sand.  Well, I didn't know how else to put it.  That's okay, Joni.  Thank you.  All right, good luck, Dylan.  Bon appétit! 
[02:30:30]  All right.  Melanie, what's up?  I actually just wanted to advise her.  AstroGlide is the thing to use.  AstroGlide?  What the hell is that?  That's the best.  Is that a type of lubricant?  Yeah, it is.  Yeah, okay.  It's like the best.  All right.  Wow.  She's just got to like maneuver her body a certain way.  It's just, it's weird, but.  Like a big holiday ham.  Make her body look like a giant holiday ham.  And you're ready to glaze it. 
[02:31:00]  Glaze it.  Make a little target with a slice of pineapple, perhaps.  Right around the leviteria with plenty of more and on.  You know how you poke the holiday ham with clothes?  In series, just put a big slice of pineapple right around the leviteria.  Drive away, stomp away.  Make a big stuffed pork chop.  But the most important thing is the more and on. 
[02:31:30]  No, guys.  Guys.  Yeah.  The most important thing is to have you go real slow.  Okay.  If it goes in too fast, it'll kill us.  Go and steady when you're ready.  Thanks.  Thank you, Melanie.  All right.  Bye-bye.  You won't let you cook a holiday.  Take it very slowly.  Melanie, it wouldn't be good if you just used a whole fist of germs and stuff it in.  Oh, God.  No, thanks.  I got the sickest visual in my head right now.  Julian Child loves anel.  Can you imagine what that looks like? 
[02:32:00]  It looks just like one of those red-ass monkeys.  My balloon nut.  My 85-year-old balloon nut.  Oh, look.  I'm making my own balloon nut.  No, Julia.  You're making your own brown sauce.  No, it's a brown sauce.  It's almost like a balloon nut.  Okay.  Terrific.  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk. 
[02:32:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  And cut.  O.P.  Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  I remember that remark.  That's the okay, terrific guy, Anthony.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  That's right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:33:00]  Coming.  Coming.  Coming.  Virgin.  I guess Scott Muni commented about us playing his voice on our show.  Virgin.  Yeah.  He said bitch on his show today.  On his little show over there.  That's something like if another radio show wants to use that, he can.  Yeah.  Or he can or whatever.  Feel free.  Bitch.  Feel free.  Bitch.  Unfortunately, Scott, so we can't record you on another station and use you here. 
[02:33:30]  So we have to paw through years of tape and try to find more cuts of Scott's up.  Where's Psycho Mark?  Because they found a tape of Scott Muni.  Remember the big blackout of 77?  19 or 18?  The blackout of 1877.  The blackout of 77.  Remember the city was in just complete turmoil?  Yeah.  It was just a little taut.  I guess they found, like, audio of Scott Muni, like, broadcasting from the Empire State 
[02:34:00]  building?  Scott.  Is that true?  What was the tape saying?  I don't know.  Jimmy found it.  It was in the archives.  Okay.  Yeah.  And, uh...  It was in the archives.  Yeah.  And, uh, remember the big blackout of 1977?  Yeah.  You wouldn't remember that because you were living somewhere else.  I heard about it.  Mm-hmm.  Anyhow, uh, they had to, uh, naturally the whole city was shut down. 
[02:34:30]  I guess they had some backouts.  The whole city was shut down.  There was looting and rioting.  Rioting and raping going on.  And that was before Giuliani had everybody corralled in.  He'd have, he'd have the cops out on the street, like, in two seconds with, uh, automatic  weapons.  That was an opportunity.  Tunity is what that was.  Shopping spree, they call that.  The shopping spree of 77.  God damn.  But the funny thing is, I mean, this place...  I need a TV.  Give me a break.  There we go. 
[02:35:00]  Oh, look at that.  That's a nice thing in Macy's window.  I'll grab that.  This place had its priorities all mixed up, though, because people are looting and raping  and shopping.  I have to get on the air.  So he went to the transmitter on the top of the Empire State Building.  Is that the truth?  And was, and wanted to tell everyone that the rock and roll will continue playing on  any W.  I'm just amazed.  Wait a minute.  If it was a blackout, the elevators didn't work.  You're telling me Scottson walked up 86 flights of sand?  I don't know how, but they got him up there. 
[02:35:30]  Come on.  They had King Kong carry him up.  Climb up the outside.  You know, he's broadcasting from this room.  It just sounds like this big, giant hall.  Really?  And he's going...  And it's got so here.  And I wanted to remind everybody out there that we are still playing music.  Oh, yeah.  You still get the best rock and roll.  Even when society as we know it is crumbling outside.  Blow me.  Even anarchy needs a soundtrack.  Want to thank Patrick Ewing for carrying me to the top of the Empire State Building? 
[02:36:00]  Oh, Samuel.  It's coming.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:30]  Here we are.  It's a total anarchy outside.  But we're here bringing you the best in rock and roll.  Scott Muni, the soundtrack of disaster.  Outside.  We're going to try to get to some Pink Floyd.  Bullets just riddling my studio.  Two for Tuesday must go on. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, go find that.  Here it is.  The Beatles on N.E. Double.  British Biscuits.  Oh, that was a low one.  British Biscuits 
[02:37:30]  Bringing you British Biscuits  Whoa, that was a low one  Blackout down on the street  I mean that in more ways than one  Little racial joke by Scott Bell  Complete chaos, but we had our rock and roll back in 1977 
[02:38:00]  Lights are up from the top of the Scott Muni building  Oh man, is that funny  It ain't, yeah  I gotta get to the Empire State Building  People need their rock and roll  It's Two for Tuesday  On N.E.W.  The Beatles 
[02:38:30]  Revolution N.E.W.  Revolution N.E.W.  Revolution N.E.W.  I remember when John Lennon came into this very studio  And boom, that one came through the window  Excuse me while I return fire 
[02:39:00]  No one's taking Scott Bell out  Yeah, it's gonna be all right  If you listen to Scott Bell on N.E.W.  Let me just pick a few off from high atop the Empire State Building  Let me get my high-powered rifle  Look at that one with the TV 
[02:39:30]  There it goes  Playing your best rock and roll music from the Beatles  And picking off looters from high atop the Empire State Building  Hey, Leroy  Where rock lives  And looters die  Hold on, I think we actually found the  This is the real thing  Oh, it is? 
[02:40:00]  Wait, you got the real thing, really?  All right, we're going into the N.E.W.  Archives  We like to do that from time to time here  On the O.P. and Anthony Show  So this is actual tape of Mr. Muni  Broadcasting live from the top of the Empire State Building  During the blackout, right?  This is it  Okay  1977  77  Let's take it back a few years  It's coming?  All right, here we go  Coming  They just threw the datum  There it is  Whoa  That's Cat Stevens  And we're at our transmitter site 
[02:40:30]  Scott Muni here at WNEWFM in New York  And if you are just with us  You already know what's been going on  For these, whoa, these many hours  You know  We're back on the air  Which is kind of nice  Although many parts of the city  Do not have power  At the moment  We are in a room that is  One we're unaccustomed to  Equipment we're unaccustomed to and all 
[02:41:00]  But we will be doing music  And we will be giving you information  At this moment  There is the possibility  That up until midnight  Many parts of the city  Will not be back to normal  There is a possibility  We may not be with you either  Because if they lose power again  We will disappear  I have a small microphone here  And a small turntable  And just a little set up  Where we are able to talk to you  And tell you we are back on the air 
[02:41:30]  After many hours of absence  Not due to anything else  Other than another historical event  From New York City  That will be written about  And talked about  Motion pictures made about albums  And no doubt  It will be a song  Someone right now  Is writing this song  Or already has written it  About  Twelve years after the first one  Here in 1977  The blackout of 77  Which of course wrote  All the records  Of the previous blackout 
[02:42:00]  And it is warm  And we have music for you  We are WNAWFM in New York  If you would like  I think it might be a nice idea  To tell some of your friends  Since we are sort of a family  If you will talk to your friends  If you have some telephones  You're working  And say  NAWFM's back on the air  And we do intend to give you  All sorts of news  What is going on  What's going on now  A lot of people are talking  About what happened  Or why it happened 
[02:42:30]  And why  You know  Things didn't work out  The way it was  What the hell is that  At any rate  We will have music for you  And we're just  Hello Sarah  Connect me to Mayberry  That's a telephone ring  Wow  That's classic  Now we're back on  Back on the air  77  And we might lose power  Pretty much the whole city  Didn't have electricity  And Scott Muni still had  More of an audience  Than our old morning show  Absolutely 
[02:43:00]  You say we got a revolution  Firetruck  Rolling past  Backup studio here  For NAW  Carnage in the streets  Looked like a butcher truck  Overturned  But we're playing  The Beatles  Because we have to do  What we have to do
