<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of MSNBC's *Morning Joe*, focusing on Mika Brzezinski's perceived incompetence and distracting on-air behavior.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, mocked her appearance and speculated on the reasons for her employment, contrasting her with the seemingly exasperated Joe Scarborough.  Other *Morning Joe* personalities, including a Black man described as “nerdy” and Donnie Deutsch, also became targets of their ridicule.  This transitioned into a discussion of other female news anchors, including Megyn Kelly and Rachel Maddow, with comments on their appearance and one host's admission to masturbating to a picture of Maddow. The segment then veered into a discussion of rumors surrounding a death in Joe Scarborough's office, speculating on a potential cover-up aided by the timing of 9/11, and broadened to include discussions of Gary Condit and Hillary Rosen's criticism of Ann Romney.  The hosts debated the difficulties faced by working mothers and the hypocrisy of politicians.

The show continued with a discussion sparked by Hillary Rosen’s comments on Ann Romney.  Opie, Anthony, and Sam, a show employee, debated Rosen's apology and the economic struggles of women. This led to various tangents, including listener feedback criticizing Sam, Opie's childhood experiences, his mother's work life, a listener call,  an anecdote about a homeless man, Friday the 13th superstitions, Bill Burr's views on motherhood, and upcoming guest appearances by Bill Burr, Joe DeRosa, and Ricky Gervais (Jim Gaffigan having cancelled).  Joe DeRosa, present in studio, discussed his impending move to Pennsylvania to help family and contrasted his actions with a comedian friend who complained about helping his disabled brother.  The hosts also discussed Kurt Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, and Courtney Love’s accusations against Dave Grohl, and compared Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel's public personas.

The next segment focused on Elton John and Billy Joel, analyzing their perceived homosexuality and the incongruence between their public images and their sexual orientations.  The hosts analyzed music videos, speculated on their sexual experiences and referenced Liberace.  The conversation extended to other musicians, including Phil Collins, Van Morrison, and Michael McDonald.  A detailed discussion of what constitutes "flirting" between men, including showering and genital touching, ensued.  A significant portion debated performing oral sex on a transsexual woman (Bailey J) versus a transsexual man (Buck Angel).  Studio guest Roland recounted his story of photographing Governor Chris Christie asleep at a Bruce Springsteen concert, which garnered media attention.  The segment concluded with discussion of an upcoming offensive segment in Cleveland involving Jim Norton's ability to identify menstruating women by smell and personal anecdotes about embarrassing sexual encounters involving menstrual blood.

A subsequent segment heavily featured a hypothetical discussion about oral sex with Buck Angel,  with explicit and vulgar language. This was followed by a news story about a Santa Fe police sergeant caught masturbating in his squad car, with audio of his self-recorded commentary played.

The show culminated in an interview with Ricky Gervais. The conversation ranged from religion (including a listener's call arguing atheists have killed more people than religious believers), the difficulties of comedy in the age of social media, and Gervais's work, particularly *The Ricky Gervais Show* featuring Carl Pilkington.  Gervais discussed upcoming projects, including *Derek*, and his weight loss.  The interview also included a graphic and humorous debate, involving the hosts and Gervais,  on which of Bailey Jay and Buck Angel they would prefer to have sex with, described as a "Kobayashi Maru" scenario, along with plugs for his show and mentions of other comedians.  The segment ended with Gervais promoting his show's premiere.  The entirety of the broadcast employed extensive offensive language and discussed potentially offensive topics throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah, let's do that.  Hello.  I don't even know if we could do justice to what we've been watching for the last 15 minutes.  Every morning, we have that friggin' Morning Joe show on, on MSNBC.  Well, we have everyone represented, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Because now you're going to piss off the Fox people.  We do have Fox, and we've got CNN in the middle, and we've got MSNBC. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, we have all the news channels on.  But we turned the audio on for Morning Joe.  Because Morning Joe, Joe Scarborough, I met him.  I did a little time at MSNBC one day, and he's a really cool guy.  He really is. As a man, he's a good man.  And I'm not talking about his politics and all that.  I'm just saying, as a dude, I like the guy.  Right.  And they teamed him up with his blonde bimbo.  Mika something?  Mika.  And she is the worst thing on TV. 
[00:01:00]  Horrible.  She's horrible.  Right now, Joe Scarborough has his arms folded because he can't stand her.  It's so obvious.  The body language between those two.  It's just, he is so mad.  She is just an interrupting boob.  Right.  She doesn't let him be a guy with the other guys at the table because they've got kind of a round table kind of a thing in the morning with various reporters and political people and sometimes entertainers.  So he's trying to talk to the guys kind of even just as a little intro to the show. 
[00:01:30]  Like, hey, did you see the hockey game last night or something?  And she's just rolling in our eyes and making mouth fucking movements and looking at him and commenting how they should just get right to the news.  She says stuff like, are you guys done?  And it's usually a really big event.  I think, like, they were discussing the Masters, let's say.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden she goes, are you guys done?  Can I get to my news?  Yeah.  And her news is reading. 
[00:02:00]  She just reads off a teleprompter.  She wants everyone to stop what they're doing so she can read something.  Yeah.  Not adding anything to the discussion at hand.  She makes all these weird fucking faces like she's eating her own face.  Yeah.  Her mouth is going like.  She's biting her lips.  She opens her mouth like she's going to say something, but she actually has nothing to say.  She's just extremely uncomfortable on camera.  Extremely.  Yeah.  And you can tell that Joe Scarborough is like, they fucking paired me up with this bimbo. 
[00:02:30]  I want to be doing this show by myself.  Yeah.  So this morning they're talking about this Hillary, what's her name?  Rosen, I guess, right?  Rosen, I guess.  Hillary Rosen and Romney's story.  Right.  Which is big today.  Yeah.  And Joe Scarborough is talking about it.  And she chimes in like, well, you know, you just like going off.  She pretty much said, well, you just like going off on these stories pretty much half cocked. 
[00:03:00]  So let me explain what you're talking about to the people.  Right.  And she explains like the story.  No, she doesn't explain.  She never explains.  She doesn't explain it.  She starts reading.  Yeah.  She starts reading.  She reads the headline in the Wall Street Journal.  That's her explaining.  And she has no thoughts in her own head.  And Joe Scarborough just like he he's so mad and he turns to her and just goes, you know,  you're just being so condescending to our audience.  Like he goes, they're watching a political show at this hour. 
[00:03:30]  I think they know what the story is.  Like he's saying, I think they know.  And he's being smart because with the Internet and everything, if that's your what you're into,  you know this already.  Right.  No one's watching the headlines in the morning and getting surprised anymore.  Of course not.  And between Twitter and everything else, you know what's happening.  Basically, you got to give the headline.  You read a little bit.  And then hopefully you have some thoughts in your brain.  Right.  That's that's where we are in the media.  That's pretty much it.  Like I read.  I think we've said it a few times.  I read three or four newspapers in the morning quickly. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And I think you said one day when we're sitting here, like, you're like, why are you even  reading those?  I'm like, you know what?  You're right.  I think it's just habit.  Yeah, it's pretty much all these years of doing just that to prepare for a radio show.  But, you know, you know everything in that paper.  Everything.  And a lot of this stuff in our papers and, you know, it's Daily News, New York Post, Newsday,  USA Today, The Times is laying around.  A lot of the times it's stories that we did yesterday.  Right.  A lot of times.  Yeah.  So, you know, I mean, if you do a show where you're just reading headlines, that's a waste 
[00:04:30]  of fucking time.  Everyone knows it already.  And especially a political show like that.  So Scarborough is just being condescending.  I think a lot of people know by now, like, I can't help myself on Twitter.  I have to lash out.  And I've written him some tweets about it.  Oh, have you?  And I think I'm going to write him another one today.  Oh, boy.  I wrote him one tweet, like, how is it to do a morning show with a mannequin every morning?  I can't help myself.  Look at her.  She's just staring.  She makes like 20 to 30 weird fucking faces every 15 minutes. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Now her lips are pursed together real tight and her eyes are squinty.  Yeah.  She's looking at him like, but she looks around.  She doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing when Joe Scarborough talks because they  go for the two camera shoot.  Yeah.  You know what?  I don't even know if this makes sense to people.  Yeah.  It's what it is.  But it's it entertains the fuck out of us every morning as we're getting ready to go  on the air yesterday when Joe Scarborough was saying something, she looked into the  camera and made her eyes real wide for a split second. 
[00:05:30]  Right.  I don't know what it was, but it had me cracking up.  She just makes faces.  She opens her mouth like, oh, is she going to say something?  Oh, no.  She never says anything.  That's that's the no.  That's the point we're making.  And I I've I've heard rumors that, like, she's married to someone very powerful and  that's why she's on this show.  And and so Joe's kind of stuck with her.  Oh, God.  I mean, she has absolutely nothing to add to this TV show. 
[00:06:00]  Never.  She's a news reader.  And then they got this black nerd.  He's the nerdiest black guy I've ever seen in my life.  Urkel ass Urkel.  He's he's like a yeah, he's an Urkel clone.  And then you got Donnie Deutsch.  We did a show once and never aired for whatever reason, because he was very unorganized when  he was doing his TV show.  Yeah, we actually that's the time we met Chevy Chevy Chevy Chevy Chevy.  However the fuck I say Chevy and then I people correct me.  But Chevy Chevy.  It's Chevy. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  Yeah.  But that's the day we met him because he was on the same show that never I don't think  his segment aired either because they were they were taping way in advance.  And by the time they were going to run our episode or whatever you want to call it, like  the news was really old already.  Yeah.  And they go, oh, yeah, maybe that wasn't a good idea to talk about, like, like current  topics.  Current topics.  Yeah.  On something that's going to air in three weeks.  And he's a nice guy, but he he dresses kind of like he really cares about his clothes, 
[00:07:00]  but he he wants to make it look like he just threw it on in the morning.  But it's so calculated and that drives me nuts.  Yeah.  Like his hair is sort of messy, but, you know, he made it messy on purpose.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Where it's like, oh, no, man, I just rolled out of bed and I came down to the studio.  Oh, my shirt's on button.  I didn't even realize, you know, those type of guys.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Just rolled out of bed. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ran here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That that look took him two hours to get right in the morning.  Come on.  Yeah.  Let me casual.  Just threw it on.  Look, Ron and Worcester has a little info.  Ron, go ahead.  Yeah, guys.  Yeah.  That's that.  Dizzy bitch is the big new Brzezinski's daughter.  I think he was like Jimmy Carter's secretary of state or something.  So why is she on TV?  Because she's the big new Brzezinski's daughter. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, but that's about her only redeeming quality, I would think.  I really don't know why she's on TV.  She's not.  She's not a bad looking older woman.  You know, she's probably like middle age, I guess.  Yeah, she's.  She's not bad to look at, I guess.  She's over the hump.  But she has absolutely nothing to offer.  And you see Scarborough's like you could tell he's fucking stuck.  He does not like sharing a camera with that woman.  Because she has nothing. 
[00:08:30]  No.  The show is all about a casual kind of atmosphere.  They're hanging out.  It's got a round table thing.  And she is a monkey wrench thrown right at him.  I forgot what it was because we should have done this break a couple weeks ago.  But there was a massive like kind of story that happened that they were all excited about.  Was it Tiger Woods winning?  Oh, it might have been that.  I forgot.  And she's like, are you guys done?  You guys done?  You guys done?  It might have even been the Super Bowl. 
[00:09:00]  Are you guys done?  It might have been.  I think it was the Super Bowl.  It was either the Super Bowl or something Lynn related.  Oh.  It was a sports story.  It was a huge sports story where not only where, you know, you expect, I guess, it's going  to sound shitty, but you expect guys to talk about it.  But it was one of those sports stories that everybody was involved because they're like,  wow, it might have been Jeremy Lynn.  Yeah.  And they're getting excited talking about this and that.  And she just looks at them all and goes, and it's obvious if you're watching, it's working.  The chemistry's there. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  And she goes, are you guys done with your dumb basketball or whatever it was?  And Joe Scarborough looked at her like, oh, this fucking cunt.  She just doesn't.  This fucking cunt.  She doesn't understand.  She doesn't get it.  But we watch every morning.  So if you want to join us, it's terrific.  Six o'clock it comes on.  We have a few minutes as the intro's playing and stuff.  There's just something too masculine about her.  I don't.  Yeah, she looks like a young Glenn Close in that picture. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't find her attractive in the least.  No, but I mean, you can tell she's put together all right.  I mean, I'm not saying like I'm getting chubbies over her or anything.  But it just cracks us up.  I mean, I count the number of weird faces she makes.  It's astounding.  It's just astounding.  Then she'll pick up her coffee sometimes and just like give it a look like.  Look at it and hold it.  Not drink it. 
[00:10:30]  Like hold it and then put it down.  It's like who does that to their own coffee?  Yeah.  She's terrible.  I guess.  I don't know.  I hope we did it justice.  Yeah.  It just fucking entertains the hell out of us.  The whole dynamics of the whole thing.  Because you know Scarborough.  A can handle the show by himself and B wants it.  Oh, yeah.  You can tell he just wants it.  Yeah, they just threw her in his lap and he's got to deal with it.  You need a woman's point of view on that show, Joe.  Do I? 
[00:11:00]  Really?  But she doesn't give any point of view.  No.  All she does is read the news, almost says something the entire time she's on.  Almost says something.  She doesn't add an opinion.  She doesn't add that whole thing of guys hanging out and talking.  Right.  Well, today's a perfect example.  I mean, there's a women's issue with Ann Romney.  Yeah.  So she could throw the woman's kind of opinion in there.  And no, she'd rather just read the story from the news.  Right.  And then let them try to talk about it while she interrupts. 
[00:11:30]  That's the show.  Is she a whole?  She is a whole.  She's the definition of the whole, man.  Because, you know, you've got these other women that are on TV and they do a good job.  They get in there.  They mix it up.  They know what they're doing, you know?  Yeah.  But this one certainly has nothing, I mean nothing, Ted.  I like that, what's her name, that Kelly from Fox?  Kelly, Fox and Friends.  No, she does the afternoon kind of thing on what's happening or happening now or something. 
[00:12:00]  I would have to see her face.  Oh, Megyn Kelly, that's her name.  Megyn Kelly.  Yeah, Megyn Kelly.  Thank you.  Yeah, she's pretty good.  She throws in like a fucking joke every so often.  She goofs on some of the stories.  She comments on them.  Let me see.  Like, she's actually not too shabby.  Oh, yeah, okay.  With the whole thing.  Yeah, she's aight.  She's aight.  And then before her is that redhead.  Fox definitely has the hottest fucking newscasters.  Absolutely.  Out there. 
[00:12:30]  Absolutely.  Well, I mean, let's not count out Rachel Maddow, though.  Come on.  Oh, Jesus.  Let's not count her out.  Oh, God.  She's a looker.  Rachel Maddow and her penis.  Holy shit.  Well, wow, that's a nice picture of Megyn Kelly.  Megyn Kelly picture?  Megyn Kelly.  That was before she had those kids, I think.  Google image that shit.  That's pretty good, though.  She's kind of bending over in a black dress.  Her cans are hanging out.  That's from GQ.  Wow.  Rachel Maddow.  One night, I couldn't help myself with her.  You jerked off to her?  Well, sure.  You have to. 
[00:13:00]  You have to.  Just to, you know.  You have to.  See if you can.  I just want to try it out, you know.  I'm acknowledging I can't help it.  And one day, one night just before her show, I just, I tweeted her.  I just said, hey, Rachel, boxers or briefs tonight?  I can't help it.  It drives me nuts.  And I'll tell you why Rachel Maddow drives me nuts.  Because she doesn't want to dress like that.  She wants to dress like a boy.  Even in the MSNBC dumb commercials that we make fun of, she's in a hoodie. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know, they're like, all right, well, we'll let you wear the hoodie.  Because you're not in studio.  But she wants to say thank you.  She wants to be a fucking boy with how she dresses.  But MSNBC is like, there's no way.  No one's going to listen to you.  You know, they think she's, I guess she's highly intelligent and stuff and whatever.  You could disagree or agree with her, but she kind of is intelligent.  And they're like, they're not going to listen to you because you got to, we got to make you look sort of feminine. 
[00:14:00]  Sort of fem you up a little bit.  So I'm sure that was negotiated with her agent, how feminine she would appear on TV.  Yeah, because there's a picture of her right there that we're looking at now.  You would swear.  Where she's got a leather jacket on, a t-shirt.  Her hair is so short.  Right.  And she's got these round Harry Potter glasses on.  You would swear that's a guy if you didn't know that was Rachel Maddow.  I would swear that's a guy.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yes.  She's got a leather jacket on, a white t-shirt and jeans.  Yeah.  She looks like a dude.  What broad do you know that? 
[00:14:30]  Where's that?  She looks like a dude.  Robin Mead from CNN is a supermodel.  Oh, is that the redhead?  Hey, Scarborough's...  Where's Robin Mead?  Huh?  What?  No, that's her.  Okay.  That's headline news?  I don't know.  She's a little porky.  What are you talking about?  I don't mind a little...  Oh, okay.  That's an older picture.  Yeah, she's got some heft to her these days.  Yeah, but you can tell by the swimsuit bottoms. 
[00:15:00]  That was a while ago.  Boredoms.  Remember when they used to come up the sides?  Very high cut on the hip.  Above the hip?  Yes.  The hip bone would actually stick out the leg hole on the bottom.  Yeah, she's all right, man.  She's got a buxom.  She's a buxotic.  I like buxotics.  50-50 where it counts.  I like buxotics.  You like a good buxotic?  You don't like to throw a buxotic in there every once in a while?  I like a good buxotic.  All right, thank God.  I don't mind a good buxotic.  Buxotic.  Just a little thick? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shapely thick.  Shapely.  Good round figure.  Nice hips and bosom.  A good bosom.  Bosom.  Oh, it was the Super Bowl that brought on MSNBC.  She said, thank you, AJ.  She said she didn't watch it.  She said her family was downstairs watching.  Oh, right.  How do you do any type of show in the media and not watch the Super Bowl?  You're going to be on the morning after the Super Bowl.  How about maybe you just know something?  Just watch it and find some kind of angle. 
[00:16:00]  Just find an angle.  I mean, there's got to be something there you could either goof on or comment about.  Right.  There's a YouTube clip of her putting vodka in her tea before she goes on the air.  Please find that.  She sounded a little soused this morning.  She said something, and it was almost a slur.  I think...  Not a racial slur.  Like a, you know...  There's something going on.  This was that close.  I'm trying to get an audio of her.  There's something going on, man.  She's...  She...  She...  It looks like they can't fire her for whatever reason.  I'm drinking vodka in her tea. 
[00:16:30]  Get a coffee.  What is nice.  She's making coffee.  She's not kidding either, by the way.  Did she get upset at us?  I guess she did.  Oh, I'm such a journalist.  Did you see the little airport bottle of vodka she had there?  Yeah, I did.  What?  I just got my tea.  Dude.  No, we're kidding.  She doesn't have one.  Keep the vodka.  Was that...  Was that real?  What the fuck was that?  Oh, they...  There was a little Sky Vodka bottle from, like, that you get on the airplane.  Yeah.  And she...  Tom, we'll get back to you with any breaking news. 
[00:17:00]  Where's Mika?  Seriously, where's Mika?  I don't know.  She's literally getting coffee.  Isn't it nice?  Oh, she's making coffee.  She's kind of held it up to the camera a little bit.  Yeah, I think...  That's fake.  I think it's kind of a bit.  Yeah, that was a gag.  I think it's kind of a bit.  I'm not buying that.  But I think she might have been kind of a side little player with Joe Scarborough.  Right.  And they put her on as one of the main people.  A main player on the fucking show.  And you can tell it's just not fucking working.  But it's fun to watch, man. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Let's go to Sean in Orlando.  Sean.  Yeah, she may have something on good old Joe there because he was a rising star in the  Republican Party until they found his intern dead in his office.  Is that what happened?  Is that real?  Yeah.  And by the way, check out Fox News.  Andrew Lloyd Webber's daughter.  Yeah.  That's a hot piece of ass there.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen Andrew Lloyd Webber's daughter.  I actually went out with her and a bunch of people once. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  Is she hot?  She's fucking smoking.  I would have to see her picture.  I don't know what we're looking at.  Yeah.  I want to know about Scarborough.  Imogene.  Because Scarborough, he was a rising star in the Republican Party, but he certainly leans more  Democratic at this point.  He's pretty much in the middle.  Yeah, he's in the middle.  You think he's a middle guy?  He's a middle-of-the-road kind of guy.  Well, I guess what I meant was he pushed more to the left since being in the Republican  Party.  Yeah.  But you're right.  You're right.  More of a moderate.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, do you know why the intern was dead in his office? 
[00:18:30]  God.  I don't remember the exact reasons.  Maybe Sammy there can look it up on Wikipedia, but he's like something.  Apparently, she fell, hit her head.  Oh, boy.  That doesn't sound good.  She's dead, and then he's not a representative anymore.  He resigned.  You think that would fuck up your career?  Oh.  You think that would fuck up your career?  He was one of the rising stars under the Newt-led Congress.  Was it a woman or a girl intern? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  It's been 15 years.  I always say political careers are ended by dead girls or live boys.  Dead girls or live boys.  That ends every political career.  Yep.  Oh.  Okay.  Here we go.  I knew there was a connection here somewhere.  Go ahead, Kevin.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  So Mika Brzezinski, her husband, is like a producer on the show.  So he produces the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  So when I see her just staring at the camera, she's almost just like burning a hole, and 
[00:19:30]  I was like, can you believe this shit?  Iraq's shaking his head no.  Iraq, no on that.  Well, according to Wikipedia, he works at ABC here in New York.  Oh.  Oh, ABC now.  Well, maybe.  All right.  Nailed.  I know there's something going on.  To quote Alex Trebek, sorry.  Sorry.  That's a good story.  That was a good out.  All right.  I guess enough of that, huh?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Just take a peek for yourself.  There's a lot going on there.  That's true, though? 
[00:20:00]  I mean, what do you got on that Joe Scarborough intern thing?  Uh, it happened apparently in 2001.  It's very, it's not publicized much.  Somebody got fired from MSNBC for bringing it up on Twitter.  Oh, really?  There's not a lot of information.  Oh, wow.  Fuck.  They try to bury this shit.  Oh.  So we don't know.  I don't feel like going down this road unless we know, man.  Is that a Gary Condit thing?  Yeah.  That caller's saying this. 
[00:20:30]  We haven't found anything yet on that, so.  Oh, wow.  They want to hide some shit.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Well, I think anybody wouldn't want that out and, you know, the big story about you.  Whatever.  So, uh, Hillary Rosen.  Wait, you want this story real quick?  Oh, you got it.  Okay.  This is from this article.  It says, Scarborough got a divorce, then he suddenly resigned from Congress just six months  after re-election. 
[00:21:00]  Uh, then he suddenly resigned as publisher of the Independent Florida Sun, then just as  suddenly, Lori something, 28-year-old staffer to Scarborough was found dead in Scarborough's  district office in Fort Walton Beach, Florida.  Date was July 20th, 2001.  Cause of death, blow to the head.  Conclusion.  Heart condition caused her to collapse, fall, hit head on desk, and die.  Story, barely a blip on the radar. 
[00:21:30]  Lots of people left with lots of questions.  Ooh.  Maybe you shouldn't be talking about this.  Why are we laughing?  Wow.  That's fucked up.  And again, uh, yeah, that's a great point.  Wow.  Um, uh, Sleeping Warrior makes.  So Joe got away with it thanks to 9-11.  Oh, was that a 9-11?  Well, that was July.  July, 2001.  Oh, so they're probably, they start fishing around a little bit. 
[00:22:00]  And then 9-11 happens and, and out of the news.  What I'm about to say, you gotta listen very carefully, please.  He might not have minded 9-11.  Don't twist my words.  You know what I'm trying to say here.  Yes.  Who else got away with 9-11?  Was that Condit?  Yeah.  Gary Condit?  But it turned out that he was, he was clean, I guess.  He was innocent on that whole thing.  Nobody knows, though.  Like, when you bring up Chandra Levy, you're just like, oh, yeah.  Gary Condit, right?  Oh, yeah, Gary Condit, right? 
[00:22:30]  No, it's just some fucking...  Yeah, that played out.  So, in a way, he's pissed off that 9-11 happened because, you know...  He actually was innocent.  Yeah.  Never got to clear his name.  It's a, it's, it's a break we did a while ago and, and people get really mad.  But the fact is, when tragedies do happen, there are people that go, holy fuck, my life  just got way better because that happened.  Yeah.  And I know that's an outrageous statement.  I know that.  But that is a fact of human nature.  Yeah.  It's a horrible thing that happened on 9-11.  Yes.  Yes. 
[00:23:00]  Of course.  July of, uh...  Late July.  2001.  Yes.  And then there's this whole, September 1st, 2001.  Uh-oh.  With this whole theories going around about her medical condition being completely made up.  Oh, shit.  And all this stuff.  And like you said, it takes time to figure things out.  So it was like a week before 9-11.  You think it...  There's people sitting, you know, like, he might have been sitting in his office and went...  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:23:30]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Right?  Yeah, absolutely.  No one's going to give you these angles.  We give you the crazy angles in this show.  Oh, boy.  He might have been in his office going, holy fuck, can you believe my luck today?  I think my story is going to disappear.  And then giant Hulk Hogan leans around the building and says, hey, Joe, I did this for  you.  I did this for you.  Thanks, Hulkster.  Brother, why are you running?  I did this for you. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, thank you, Hulk.  He did it for Joe Scarborough.  He's trying to be a hero.  I'm just saying, being pissed off, but we give you different angles of the show.  Oh, man.  He might have went, oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  Just the idea of his look at the TV, like, when it first happened, going, oh.  Oh.  Hey, what's this story?  This could be a big story.  He's in his office just whistling a happy tune, and people are like, what the fuck?  Dude, why are you whistling?  You know what the fuck just happened? 
[00:24:30]  He starts realizing that it's a big enough story that the news isn't even running commercials.  Right.  And he's like, wow.  Wow.  I mean, you were an asshole back then if you put another story in the newspaper, by the way.  You couldn't.  Oh, you couldn't.  It was cover-to-cover 9-11 stuff.  That was it.  You didn't even have a little tiny square somewhere to go, Joe Scarborough, we're looking into the medical records of the lady that was now dead in his office.  He's just wiping his hands. 
[00:25:00]  That was gone.  Wiped out with the planes and the buildings.  Wiped out with the buildings and everything else was any record of Joe Scarborough's intern staffer, whatever she is.  And how the media and news works.  You don't go back to the old stories.  No.  Because eventually there's new stories you've got to go to.  We move on.  We move on.  We're past all that.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Did he fucking skate.  Wow.  So maybe that's why he's got to shut his fucking mouth because she's ready to go, hey, Joe.  How about the dead girl they found in your office? 
[00:25:30]  Oh, shit.  He's in hell.  He's in hell.  He can't let her bring that up.  That's on his mind every day.  Oh, my God.  Is today the day she brings this up?  Because I got a smile.  Because I want to call her a cunt so bad.  Oh, God.  I said she was condescending to the audience.  Is she going to bring up the dead staffer in my office?  You can't say shit to anyone.  He's got to be nice to everybody.  See, now we made it into something.  See what we do?  Right in front of your eyes, we made something out of this. 
[00:26:00]  It's admirable.  Poor bastard.  He wants.  Oh, wow.  Now I get it.  He's got to be nice to black nerd.  Black nerd Urkel guy.  That guy knows.  He could come out and say it.  Well, stupid, stupid, is it Donnie or Danny?  Donnie Deutsch.  Donnie Deutsch.  I guess it's a whole thing about his clothes, and they make fun of him, and he tries to  be like, nah, man, this was on my floor this morning.  Yeah.  I didn't even shower.  Come on.  Even though he gets up.  That's what I was wearing last night.  He gets up at two in the morning to start primping for the stupid TV show. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, of course he does.  But he makes believe, nah, I rolled out of bed.  That's why my hair looks like this.  I didn't even have time to shower.  Even though he was carefully, you know, placing every hair.  He's just displacing every curl on his head.  Displacing, I should say.  Right.  Yeah.  It's calculated displacement.  Exactly.  And then Donnie Deutsch goes to the black nerd Urkel, who sounds a bit, you know.  Light in the loafers?  Well, you said that.  You could say light in the loafers.  Light in the loafers.  That doesn't mean anything.  And then Donnie Deutsch, all excited, because they're making fun of him, you know, him in 
[00:27:00]  his clothes and his double-breasted suit.  And he turns to the black nerdy guy, who might be light in the loafers, and he goes, well,  you defended me when I wore those pink pants that day.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Of course he's going to defend pink pants.  Well, that's the point I'm making.  Yeah.  You're getting at it.  Oh.  That's not going to help you too much there, Donnie.  And Joe Scarborough's just got to sit there and be quiet.  Can't comment on any of it.  Donnie, your clothes, you know, kind of, you know, I know you're trying to pull it off 
[00:27:30]  like it's very casual, but, you know, we all know it's a very calculated move.  Hey, how about that dead staffer, Joe?  Shit.  Should have shut up about his clothes.  You look good, Donnie.  Yeah.  You look great, Donnie.  That's what he's thinking, is like that.  But he goes, Donnie, you look great this morning, because he doesn't want Donnie mentioning  the cracked-headed fucking staffer in his office.  You think that dumb broad Mika is like, kicks him in the shin every morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And her, like, under the desk, where he can't see it. 
[00:28:00]  That's her move, like, I'm going to kick you.  You know what's next.  If you continue.  First, you get kicked.  You're getting off.  I bring up the dead staffer in your office from 11 years ago.  I got to tell you, Sam doesn't laugh much on this show, but you laugh at the most twisted  shit.  There are times this show is flowing, and you just sit there staring.  And I know it's working, but what you find funny is fucked up.  Yeah.  Because this whole concept, like, his world, it just completely revolves around trying 
[00:28:30]  to make sure nobody brings it up.  No one brings it up.  He's spinning plates.  He's juggling every day of his life.  The noise that he made when the plane hit the tower.  Do you like that?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I said, oh.  Not like, yeah.  There's a difference between, oh, and oh.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, what do we got here?  Oh.  Oh.  This could be my lucky day after all. 
[00:29:00]  Because they figured out all his little loopholes, all his lies had fallen apart.  This chick that died in his office had no bad medical history, and he was about to get  busted.  And then there's, oh.  Yeah.  Let me add to it.  There's literally feds outside his office.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Surrounding the building.  Oh, how about this?  Mr. Scarborough, there's a news crew right outside the door here.  They want to talk to you.  Son of a bitch.  This is the day.  I guess I got to let him in, and we got to.  This is finally coming to a head, and I have to. 
[00:29:30]  Oh.  Oh.  What's that?  All right.  I guess send him in.  I'm sorry, Mr. Scarborough.  They just ran out of here, heading toward the Pentagon.  Yeah.  I, uh, yeah.  He opens his door to see them just fleeing.  Just running away.  A third plane has hit.  It has.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Joe.  You can't make fun of anyone. 
[00:30:00]  Oh.  You can't, though.  Now he's got to just, now he's got lucky.  It got buried.  I just got to spin my plates every day.  But it's.  Whoa.  It's always in the package.  It's always there.  For the last 11 years.  Oh, he's in the back of his head.  He's waking up saying, I'm going to give her a piece of my mind today.  I can't wait.  Oh, shit.  And then in his mind, Stafford dead in your office.  Now she, oh my God.  Cracked her head up.  I can't say anything. 
[00:30:30]  Can't criticize anyone.  I got to be fucking middle of the lot, middle of the road guy.  Yeah.  I can't be a complete Republican.  I can't be a Democrat.  Right.  Even his politics have gotten very just, hey, you, I agree kind of with that.  He's just milk toast guy now because he's just fearful.  That's why he wants to talk about the Super Bowl and the Masters.  Yeah.  Just easy stuff.  Easy stuff.  Nobody really has an opinion on.  Trying to get Billy Bush's job on Access Hollywood.  Oh, that clown. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, wow.  All right.  We made something of it.  Now I feel better because I didn't really feel like we were making our point.  You got there.  We got there, you think?  Yeah, for sure.  I like that.  I got there.  It's rare, but I got tears in my eyes.  I'm laughing.  That's classic.  It's like tears.  Because you're right.  The concept.  The whole, like, just.  Oh.  I love that.  Like, we're all like, when the planes hit, we were all like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  The horror.  What does this mean for the country?  What's going on?  He goes, oh. 
[00:31:30]  What is this?  This looks like a big story.  You don't say.  Oh.  I'm telling you, though, but there were more than Joe Scarborough, possibly.  We don't even know if Joe did that.  There were a few people around that went, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  This might change some things.  Oh.  That I was dreading.  There were some Wall Street guys like, oh, shit.  They're going to find out that I, oh.  Right.  Exactly.  Oh.  That would be a TV show I would love to see, by the way.  Just call it, oh.  Right.  The benefits of 9-11. 
[00:32:00]  Yes.  Oh, people would be outraged.  Yeah.  But it's true.  Us just talking about it can cause problems.  But I'm saying this is, as far as humanity goes, this shit does happen.  Right.  I'm sorry.  That's the world we live in.  And if somebody was brave enough to put a special together of guys and women where their lives  got better because that happened.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would be a sick fucking TV show to watch.  Because they're all horrible people anyway because they're trying to cover up something  horrible.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  Right.  And so it's not like it's crazy that they're benefited from 9-11. 
[00:32:30]  Look, the easy one to say, I bet you there were people, you know, that lost their lives  that day that were going to start just a fucking nasty divorce.  Yeah.  And the person that was left behind that's still living, in a way, was like, holy fuck.  That saved me years of anguish.  And you don't even have to look like the bad guy or anything.  No.  It's like, oh, I loved him.  Right.  Yeah.  You don't even have to look like the bad guy.  You're right.  Yeah.  Everything was so great.  Horrible to say.  I'm going to say it a million times.  Horrible to say.  But I'm telling you, some of that shit absolutely went down. 
[00:33:00]  Wow.  You're not the bad guy.  I didn't benefit you.  I'm the bad guy.  Yeah.  Here's a guy saying probably a number of women who are ready to divorce their husbands  before they died in 9-11.  Yeah.  There's a special coming on, I guess.  It's The Woman Who Wasn't There, I think it's called.  And it's about a woman that said she was in the trade center during 9-11.  Right.  And she met with Giuliani and everything and became this big proponent of the rights of the people. 
[00:33:30]  And she collected money.  And she was never there.  Really?  So they're doing a whole expose on her.  But how did they find out she wasn't there?  I don't know.  But they did.  I've got to watch the show.  It sounds pretty interesting.  That might be a tough one to prove.  I'm sure they proved it.  I think they did prove it.  They wouldn't be doing this, but I would love to know how they figured that out.  Yeah.  They absolutely proved it.  Wow.  I guess other people came forward and said, no, she wasn't anywhere near the fucking place.  Right.  Oh, really?  Lizzie Grubman. 
[00:34:00]  Huh?  Oh, wasn't that when she...  She ran over people.  That's right.  Oh, remember that?  She ran over the publicist.  Hold on.  Lizzie Grubman.  Ed and Yapank.  We forgot about this broad.  She was a very powerful publicist.  I don't even know.  Maybe she's still a publicist, but the media doesn't talk about her as much as they used  to.  Yeah.  She was in the Hamptons, and she ran over fucking people.  Yeah, and they were saying that she did it on purpose.  Right.  And that was starting to be investigating all that as well.  Yeah.  Right, Ed? 
[00:34:30]  Yep.  Wasn't she calling them white trash when she did it, too, or something?  Yeah, there was a whole thing that happened.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah?  That happened?  Yeah.  You should see if we could find what was in the news, like, right before 9-11.  September 10th.  Yeah, like the week of the...  Yeah.  The week before 9-11.  All that stuff went away.  And that stuff just disappeared.  Completely.  Just vanished.  Literally.  Just vanished.  Right.  In thin air.  And some people did say, oh. 
[00:35:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Saul.  Oh, you saw that?  Isn't this great?  Joe Scarborough in his office as the first plane hits.  Saul.  Isn't this great?  We're being shock jocks today.  I love it.  With his clumsy fucking staffer.  Right.  The old klutz. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  We're going back to our roots today.  We're shock jocks.  Oh, shocking.  Shocking.  How shocking.  We're shocking, people.  Shock jocks.  I don't be an Anthony.  Those fucking pigs.  Shut up.  My God, man.  All right.  Yeah.  I guess that's that.  So, uh, this, uh, Hillary Rosen there.  Uh.  She's a pundit.  Yeah.  What the fuck does she do?  Is she connected to Obama?  Is she connected to the Democrats? 
[00:36:00]  Where does she work?  I don't know.  But she's, uh, she goes on CNN a lot, I take it?  Yeah, I've seen her before.  Yeah?  Uh, and, you know, I don't know why we have to be the only ones, but I don't really, I'm  not really outraged by what she said.  By what she said?  Not really.  What is it she says?  She's basically saying that, you know, Ann Romney didn't really have to fucking work,  so what does she know about anything?  And then, Ann Romney had to say, well, my job was raising five kids.  And my problem with that is, I doubt very highly that she actually raised five kids without 
[00:36:30]  a lot of help.  My mom raised seven kids with no help.  Fucking, your mom raised three kids with no help.  That's raising kids.  I can't imagine, uh, uh, and Ann Romney was actually fucking, you know, raising kids like,  like a lot of the working bombs out there.  And I think that's the point she was trying to make.  But let me tell you something.  This Hillary Rosen, fuck her. 
[00:37:00]  Oh yeah, I agree with all that too.  What business?  What did a Stanford die in your office?  Yeah, okay, you're right.  You're Scarborough.  Yeah, you're born at Scarborough.  Did my voices get high?  There's no fucking, this woman has no business saying what someone did or didn't do as far  as work goes around their own fucking private home.  Don't you think she could assume a lot though, considering that there's a lot of money in that  family?  You could assume, but. 
[00:37:30]  I mean, I saw the fucking rich moms when I was growing up.  They didn't raise their kids.  There was always nannies around and all sorts of help.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  And I saw those, I saw those moms dropping their kid.  Their, their job was like, I'm going to drop you off at school today.  And they would jump out of the car to kiss the kid, uh, you know, goodbye for the day.  And she had her tennis outfit on cause she was ready going for her tennis lessons and  all that shit.  I don't know.  That's what I'm saying.  I just don't, uh, I don't, I don't like that this woman just like, it's obviously so 
[00:38:00]  politically motivated.  Would she with the DNC?  Yeah.  But, uh, but Michelle Obama and Obama himself, everyone is like distancing themselves from  what she said.  Yeah.  Because it, it, it will chase women away.  Right.  Like if, if, if, if Ann Romney wants to say she raised kids and that was her job, there's  no way you can refute that.  You can't get on television to go, ah, it's not that tough a job or, ah, you have money.  You didn't raise your kids.  You know, you just, it's a no win right there. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  So that's why we're all talking about it.  Yeah, exactly.  And even Obama got on and said, look, you know, I know that raising a family is a tough  thing to do.  And, uh, he said, uh, being a mom is, uh, one of the toughest jobs there is really.  Yeah.  But the Obama's got a wild cat oil rig worker, but let me make it easy for you.  Cause I don't, I don't really feel like politicizing this thing.  The Obama's didn't raise their fucking kids in the last bunch of years either.  Yeah.  They had all sorts of help.  What are you talking about?  They get to do the fun stuff. 
[00:39:00]  God, I'm a father, right?  If I was able to do just the fun stuff with my kid, it would be the greatest thing ever.  And then someone else takes care of all the, all the bullshit, all the bullshit.  You know, when I say that I'm babysitting and people get mad at me, that's the bullshit  stuff where you're just sitting around babysitting.  If I was able to just do fun shit, throw the ball with the kid, take them to the park, put  them on my bike and go for a ride.  Holy fuck.  That would be fun.  That's what I'm getting at today.  You think that's all that Ann Romney did?  Um, I, uh, the little I know. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  In general, I do.  I do believe that.  And, uh, and I think, you know, to be fair, I do believe that as far as the Obama's go  as well.  It's been definitely the last three and a half years.  They, they, they, they haven't babysat their kid, as I like to say.  Not, you just see Obama with his kids.  It's all the easy stuff.  Oh, let's photo op with the dog.  And, and, uh, oh, we're going to do a little fun Easter, uh, thing here.  We're going to read to children and you guys can hang.  And the secret service does like some of the heavy lifting too, with the kids.  They drive them around. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  They're taking them around.  And you know, I, you know, I, I probably should like talk, uh, about my mom in a good  way.  Sometimes she, she spent half her fucking life just go driving us around, man.  Yeah.  You think that, you think Ann Romney was driving her kids from baseball practice to  band practice, to school, to tennis lessons, to this and that.  She got a few Cadillacs.  Maybe she is driving.  That's all I'm saying.  You know, but for her to politicize and say, well, she shouldn't, uh, discuss what, uh,  women's issues and, and things happening here in the campaign, that's, that's where it's 
[00:40:30]  just ridiculous.  So she could, she could be well-informed and educated on stuff because she didn't have an  actual job.  Yeah.  This Hillary Rosen's comments are a little, I mean, you can't give him any credibility.  I don't know.  No, everyone just, I, I just have a feeling about that woman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she's a fatso, isn't she?  But you lived in the same areas as me on Long Island.  You saw the rich fucking moms.  They didn't do shit.  Their nails were always done. 
[00:41:00]  You can't have your nails done if you're actually raising kids.  They're clinking and clanking their mid-afternoon drinks.  Yeah.  All that shit.  Up by the Pule.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  You want to hear the actual comment?  I certainly do.  Hillary, uh, Rosin.  With, with respect to economic issues.  I think actually that, uh, Mitt Romney's right that ultimately care more about the economic  wealth and the like, but he doesn't connect on that issue.  What you have is, is Mitt Romney's country saying, well, you know, my, what women really care 
[00:41:30]  about are economic issues.  And when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.  Guess what?  His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.  She's, she's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of  the women in this country are facing in terms of how do we feed our kids?  How do we send them to school?  And, and, and how do we worry and why do we worry about their future?  So I think it's, yes, it's about these positions.  I just want to stop. 
[00:42:00]  I don't hate what she said right there.  I believe that.  Yeah, but you're almost chastising someone for being lucky and successful and whatever,  you know?  Well, cause she's going to come, I think she's going to come across in this election like  she's like a regular mom that, you know, how to raise her five boys with no help.  And, and she's going to try to hint that economically sometimes she didn't know where the next meal  was coming from or how to pay bills.  I know that fucking struggle.  I saw it in my own family.  My mom panicking cause we didn't have enough money. 
[00:42:30]  She didn't have to deal with any of that.  That's all I'm saying to politicize it is, you know, I, I, I completely agree with you.  There is an emotional raising of kids that you have to do, you know, perhaps she was very  involved in their, um, their, uh, education.  Perhaps she was very involved in their, uh, you know, mental wellbeing and being raised as  a good people kind of a thing.  I don't know.  I don't know.  And this Hillary Rosen doesn't fucking know either what, what she did, uh, just because 
[00:43:00]  you're well off financially doesn't mean you have no, um, responsibility or that you didn't  work at other things that don't take money.  Right.  You know, there are plenty of people that are broke ass broken, uh, and, and do a great  job, uh, raising their kids mentally.  And then there's, there's other people that suck at it, uh, where the money doesn't really  mean anything.  I don't know.  I think this fucking slob should keep a yap shut.  We worry.  And why do we worry about their future? 
[00:43:30]  So I think it's, yes, it's about these positions.  And yes, I think there will be a, a, a war of words about the positions, but there's something  much more fundamental about Mitt Romney.  He just, he seems so old fashioned when it comes to women and I think that comes across  and I think that that's going to hurt him over the longterm.  He just doesn't really see us as equal.  I guess my point is I, I, I, I hate that he's going to try to like, uh, you know, show 
[00:44:00]  the country that he's a regular guy and had, you know, and had the same struggles as, as  the middle class, you know, and they're going to try to do that shit and that, and that's  going to try me nuts.  Well, by the way, I don't like Obama, you know that.  Yeah.  Cause people think I like Obama.  No, I don't.  Well, I like him and, and, and I don't like him more and more by the day.  They'll, they'll, uh, as far as Obama goes and she's not a reelection campaign, he'll,  he'll go off on Romney and do the same thing that she's doing and try to divide the country 
[00:44:30]  on financial and on economic lines.  It's like, like he's been doing, um, this entire time he's been in office.  Yeah, exactly.  Class warfare, they've called it, but it pretty much is dividing the country, uh, as far as,  uh, economics goes.  There's no honesty.  No, none.  There's no honesty.  But we knew that.  Yeah, I guess, but I'm frustrated that.  It's very frustrating.  This is how it has to be, uh, every time there's an election in this country.  Absolutely no honesty.  You know how much money all these motherfuckers have and shell out for their reelection campaigns 
[00:45:00]  and, and whatnot.  It's, it's like for any of them to point the finger and say one person has more money than  I have when they all are spending literally millions upon millions of dollars just to keep  their fucking jobs, uh, it, it, it's hypocritical and ridiculous and everyone should see right  through it.  No, it's funny over the years when you would say, or people in general, uh, they have millions  upon millions, that doesn't seem like a lot anymore compared to what they're actually 
[00:45:30]  spending.  What they're really spending.  Yeah.  Of millions.  It's probably close to a hundred million.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just, uh, yeah, they're, they're battling each other and trying to name call, but they're  all the same.  Like there's not one politician that could call another one out on something that hasn't  done the exact same thing.  When you see those political ads, he voted for higher taxes.  Right.  He did.  Well, you know, you probably did the same fucking thing.  Right.  With some bill that you signed that had a higher tax thing as an earmark and, you know, 
[00:46:00]  with earmarks and pork bellies, pork and, and fucking pork barrels, pork, I mean, pork  barrels, pork bellies, pork bellies, sorry, Hillary, Oh, Oh, Iraq, a pork belly.  See what happened there?  Sorry.  I saw you rock in the corner of my eye and I got confused.  It's great.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Uh, so then, and Romney said this.  Do you know, this, what's so interesting about this?  My career choice was to be a mother.  And I think all of us need to know that we need to respect choices that women make. 
[00:46:30]  Other women make other choices to have a career and raise family, which I think Hillary Rosen  has actually done herself.  Well, I respect that.  That's wonderful.  But you know, there are other people that have a choice.  We have to respect women and all those choices that they make.  And by the way, let me give a shout out to all the dads that are at home.  Oh, shout out.  That's officially never going to be used again in the black community.  If, if maybe I haven't struggled as much financially as some people have, I can tell you and promise 
[00:47:00]  you that I've had struggles in my life and I would love to have people understand that  Mitt and I have compassion for people that are struggling and that's why we're running.  Yeah, she, I mean, that's a good sound clip.  I mean, she definitely has had, um, you know, her own struggles, you know, that as my point  is the financial thing, cause I grew up pretty fucking poor.  I think there's a big fucking difference.  It makes it a lot easier if you have money. 
[00:47:30]  Well, it does.  I saw the kid.  I saw my friends and families that had money.  Their lives were so much easier.  I'm sorry.  Well, the struggles.  Sure.  They were there.  I, I, I, all right, fine.  I'm not going to argue that point cause I don't know much about her, but on in a general,  just generally, I just knew, man, I was in, I was brought up in an upper middle class  where, uh, we were like lower middle class.  So I saw it all around me, man.  Those parents fucking had no struggles in general.  Let me, let me tell you something though.  I know of a certain family that was very well off when I was growing up and, uh, they, they 
[00:48:00]  just had, they had a son that was adopted that was just a drug addict stealing fucking low  life.  Right.  And that was like a constant, just bad thing for that family.  Didn't have anything to do with money.  There was nothing they could do about it.  Uh, you know, they tried, but that's kind of a struggle and a bad thing that has nothing 
[00:48:30]  to do with money to just say you have money.  You don't have to worry about anything is so untrue.  And, and it seemed like Hillary Rosen was, uh, getting at that a case by case basis.  I think you're right, but I'm, yeah, I'm just generalizing.  Yeah.  It's just easier when you have money.  Uh, yeah, certain things are.  I'll agree with you.  It's, it's nice to not have to worry about bills.  Even if you have a shitty kid, you push all that to somebody else too. 
[00:49:00]  Cause you got the money.  But who knows if she did that?  No, I don't know.  That's, that's why I have to back up a little bit.  That's fair enough.  She may or not have done that.  I don't know.  Fair enough.  She's, you know, her struggles might've been so, you know.  She might've wanted to get right in there and, and raise her kids, uh, hands on, you  know, I don't know.  Maybe I doubt it.  That's all I'm saying.  I doubt it.  Hmm.  I didn't see that from my experience.  I think we all talk from our, our own experience.  That's all. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  That's all.  You're, you could be a hundred percent right where, yeah, she fucking drove those kids  around to everything they needed to be at.  Right.  And sure.  They had money for bills and stuff, but she had, uh, you know, different struggles.  You could be completely right.  I'm just generalizing.  Yeah.  No, I gotcha.  Which I think a lot of us do.  Yes, we do.  Except Joe Scarborough.  Very frightened.  I think there's a final clip here.  Is this, I think then back to Hillary Rosen, Rosen. 
[00:50:00]  I keep seeing Rosen.  A Rosen bag.  A Rosen bag.  Well, she looks like one.  She does look like an old Rosen bag.  They saved that in a step.  People of wealth sometimes take for granted some of the niceties that they have in life.  And the Romneys are people of wealth.  She doesn't just have, she's not just a one mom.  All right, so look into the camera.  If Ann Romney is watching you right now, talk to her.  Well, I, I send a few things this afternoon, but I'll say it again.  Mrs. Romney, I applaud your decision to stay home and raise what are obviously five wonderful 
[00:50:30]  boys.  This is not about stay-at-home moms versus working moms.  I think your husband needs to stand up for women's economic struggles.  And so far, we have not seen how he's going to do that on the campaign trail.  This hasn't come out of his mouth, and maybe it will at some point.  But this is a distraction that his campaign is forcing on the American people to avoid his  record on the issues.  I didn't hear an apology. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, well, I sent out an apology this afternoon.  I didn't hear what you say to her just now.  I'm sorry.  Well, I assumed that Mrs. Romney saw my apology this afternoon.  But if not, I apologize.  Working moms, stay-at-home moms, they're both extremely hard jobs.  I know.  I've shared them both.  And I, I'm sorry if that offended you.  More apologies, too.  Jesus Christ.  Just stand by what you said.  Yeah.  Well, and, and with that, the White House, I saw a story, pays women less than it pays 
[00:51:30]  men that work there.  So, I don't know what, what do you want?  Is that true?  It is true.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They, they, they saw that.  Are you trying to say Obama did that or has it been like that for a while?  I have no idea.  It's just, you know.  No matter who has been in the office.  Well, if, if, if it's been that way, I think Obama should have fixed it.  Women should be treated equally.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure they should.  Going to break, I have Bill Burr talking about mothers having the hardest jobs. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, great.  Yeah.  Oh, that's very cool.  Bill's a funny motherfucker.  Yes.  We did good.  I think so.  Can we go home?  That was like grown up.  No.  Talk.  Should we have, uh.  Big boy talk.  Big boy talk.  Joe DeRose is going to be coming in.  Oh, that's right.  Ricky Gervais is going to be coming in.  Yeah.  Ricky Gervais.  Still a lot to look forward to.  I think Jim Gaffigan today, too.  Jim Gaffigan's coming in.  Is that true?  I'm not sure.  I believe so.  You should know.  What the fuck is wrong with him?  You're right.  I think he, uh, booked Jim Gaffigan last minute. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, maybe not.  Yeah, I think, I think, uh, communications got crossed and we approved him, but then it  turns out that he's not actually in town.  Oh.  Well, you know what?  Then fuck Jim Gaffigan.  Oh.  That's what I say.  Oh.  He's blowing us off.  What the hell's that about Sam?  Oh, no.  He was never in town.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, then I like fucking Gaffigan.  You're like fucking Gaffigan?  Oh, that isn't, oh, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Wow, Sam's getting some hate.  For what?  Uh, you know, it happens anytime anybody, like, talks on our show. 
[00:53:00]  It really does.  It's weird.  If it's, uh, Opie or me or Jimmy Norton talking, people just say, ah, it's the show.  But you remember when Danny sat in that very seat and he'd get on mic?  He got a lot of hate.  And now you, when you chime in, are getting a lot of hate, Sam.  Generally just answering questions and responding to comments.  I understand.  I didn't mind Sam this time.  People don't.  I didn't either this time.  I appreciate it.  I mean, I'll take it.  I actually didn't mind you this time. 
[00:53:30]  I'll take that as a compliment.  I think you kind of added a little something to the first hour.  Fuck Sam's voice.  I miss Danny.  At least he could use Google.  Fuck wrestling talk.  There was no wrestling talk.  People need to get over what my voice sounds like.  I like Sam.  I mentioned Hulk Hogan.  There was wrestling talk.  So they're going to blame you for that.  I liked the Sam whose head was full of candy better.  I used to like that bit.  Fuck his cackle.  I always liked the dumbest bits.  Sam's a cute girl.  That's good.  I mean, that's not a negative thing.  No, we said earlier, I think that was off mic, that Sam's growing up in front of our 
[00:54:00]  eyes.  No, he's becoming a man in front of our eyes.  He's becoming a man right in front of our eyes.  It's creepy to us.  He's becoming a man.  You said I look older every day.  Yeah.  Oh, that's true.  It wasn't nice.  Yeah.  You come in and just a little more haggard than the day before.  I was always jealous of the rich kids.  That's where I'm coming from.  Is that it?  Oh, fuck, dude.  They all had brand new cars.  That did suck.  I almost had a car.  I call it almost because it was sort of the family car.  Oh, no. 
[00:54:30]  You said it was sort of yours.  Like, you could drive it to school.  But I think then they went and got it because they needed it for other chores.  But then maybe they brought it back.  I'm trying to remember this shit now so I could drive home and feel like I have a car.  All that shit.  I was always jealous of the guy at school that had the nice fucking, like, the Trans Am.  Brand new Beamers.  Or the fucking Z28 and shit.  I'm just like, oh, my God.  And they got it for their 16th birthday.  I'm like, what?  Yeah, and I'm driving a fucking 69 Chevy Nova with the engine ready to come out because 
[00:55:00]  the mounts are broke.  Yeah.  No air conditioning.  A window doesn't go up.  You know, because I hope I explain myself.  That's all.  You don't have to agree with me, but I just want you to know where it's coming from.  I would go to their houses and their moms wouldn't even be there because they'd be running  out because they had a lesson or something.  And then the nanny would be feeding us snacks and shit and making sure we're cool.  All that stuff.  I saw it.  Son of a bitch.  They were members of the golf.  They were the they were members of the golf course that I caddied at golf calls.  And sometimes I had a caddy for people I went to school with. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You know how mortifying that is?  That's bad.  That's like you're fucking it'd be family day.  And all sounds like you, you know, you're going to caddy for the blah, blah family today.  I'm like, I go to school with that kid.  Now I got it.  He's throwing his clubs.  Oh, and I got to go chase his clubs.  I'm like, are you fucking serious?  You're like a guy.  Well, yes, that's where it's coming from.  Yeah.  I hear you.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  And I'm still kind of bitter about the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  Kind of.  And then when it was time for, you know, colleges and stuff, because I was lucky enough to, 
[00:56:00]  you know, maybe further my education doesn't show.  I understand.  But I furthered my education.  I had to look at SUNY schools while they were looking at, like, you know, Harvard, Harvard  and studying abroad.  I'm going to study abroad.  I have a fellowship or the last day of fucking school.  They're like, oh, I'm getting, I'm going to be in Europe all summer.  Well, I'm going to be on a hot golf course handing over every dollar I make to my fucking  mom.  Picking up Spalding's clubs. 
[00:56:30]  This is fair.  Yeah.  So that's where it all comes from.  So I don't know.  You know, I, I, I don't know.  I'm very suspicious.  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  I wasn't a latchkey kid at all.  My mom was there.  My mom wasn't getting the fucking tennis lessons and all that.  She was driving us around like a lunatic.  My mom was working like all the time.  You were a latchkey kid, right?  Yeah.  She was a receptionist at like a, a haircutting place during the day.  Yeah.  And then at night on like Thursday, Friday, Saturday nights, she was a cocktail waitress 
[00:57:00]  at a disco, uh, out by the Walt Whitman mall.  Uh, and she was just always working that's not always working.  That's the sacrifices that I understand.  Yeah.  So some of that sacrifice entailed staying out late drinking and doing cocaine.  So I guess she had the fun when she could.  Well, she was trying to find a dad.  Jesus Christ.  She was trying to find a dad for you guys.  Let's not put it out there.  She had to put it out there.  Let's not go down that road. 
[00:57:30]  We were literally threatened by aunt's stepfather one day.  Literally.  I really believe that there was a, yeah, that was a while ago from aunt's stepfather.  Holy shit.  So let's, let's just leave that one alone.  That's, that scares me to this day.  He called up and basically threatened our lives.  Yeah.  Well, that'll happen.  Oh my God.  And you were serious.  Oh boy.  Anyway.  Son of a bitch.  I can't stop doing that now.  Eric in Michigan.  The world needs ditch diggers too, Opie.  You're that guy. 
[00:58:00]  I'm sorry.  You can't come.  Look, and I'll say this.  My life is way the fuck better now.  Yes.  Much better now though.  Thank you.  Yeah.  See, yeah.  There's another cat.  Yes.  No homo.  How does Opie connect with the less fortunate?  Oh yeah.  With his foot in their cake.  Oh, right.  Build a bridge, Opie.  I built a bridge that day.  I gave him a lot of money for his stale cake.  That's true.  That was.  That's why I felt good about that day.  That was the quickest demolishing and reconstruction of a bridge in your life. 
[00:58:30]  Thank you.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  He made out on that whole deal.  Homeless Andrew.  But I didn't want to show that on film, man.  I'm fucking peeling off fucking ones for this guy.  Of course.  He was out there with $13 at the end of the day.  He had a stale cake that he found in the garbage.  People still want to fucking punch me in the face over that one.  But the fact is, when the cameras stop, I'm fucking peeling off ones.  You don't have to explain yourself to these people.  Yeah.  You don't have to explain.  And he was very happy, that Andrew.  I wonder if he's still alive, Andrew.  Joe DeRosa is going to join us next, Andrew. 
[00:59:00]  Yes, he is.  So where are we at?  Fuck Jim Gaffigan or are we cool with him?  No, we like Jim Gaffigan.  No, you like to fuck Jim Gaffigan.  That would be like fucking myself, right?  No.  He's palier than me.  I like Jim Gaffigan.  He's palier.  All right, good.  Wow.  Oh, Friday the 13th.  What is that today?  Is that a problem, you think?  Unless you have Triskaidekaphobia.  Do you have Triskaidekaphobia? 
[00:59:30]  Triskaidekaphobia?  I hate when people would say that.  Do you have Triskaidekaphobia?  What does that mean?  It's Friday the 13th.  It's fear Friday the 13th.  Shut up.  Who cares?  Would you walk under a ladder today, though?  On Triskaidekaphobia Day, no.  Would you walk under a ladder?  No.  I never walk under ladders, by the way, because it's just fucking dangerous.  It has nothing to do with bad luck.  Right.  When I break a mirror, I'm not afraid of that.  I love a black cat.  Yeah.  They're very adorable.  So, no, I really don't have kind of a Friday the 13th. 
[01:00:00]  I do get a little leery if I'm flying on Friday the 13th.  What do you mean?  If you realize, like, I'm on a plane.  Yeah.  Eh.  But I bet, statistically, Friday the 13th is probably one of the safest flying days ever.  I'm talking on my ass here.  I just don't have much of a Triskaidekphobia.  Triskaidekphobia.  You think, you know the, what floor isn't in the building?  Jesus, that's horrifying.  13?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the dumbest thing ever. 
[01:00:30]  The elevator goes 12, 14.  But there is a 13th floor.  It's the 14th floor.  It's the 13th floor.  Right.  So, wouldn't you avoid the 14th floor?  Yeah, you would think, because it really is the 13th floor, but it's 14.  No, it's not.  It's 13.  Yeah.  What are we trying to do as a society?  It's still 13.  It is amazing that a superstition can play such an important part that they leave out the number 13 on a building elevator.  Yeah, they would have to build an entire 13th floor, leave it completely empty, and not make an elevator stop there.  Right.  There you go, Sam. 
[01:01:00]  Sam's a-  A solution to the problem.  Yeah.  That's fucking brilliant.  Even though Sam's a hated asshole, he does come up with the occasion-  Who hates me?  Oh, everybody.  What?  But he just nailed it.  That's what you should do.  But, of course, you know, real estate is so important.  Yeah.  Well, if you're going to go to the silliness of not putting it in the elevator, you need a floor to not have access to.  Yeah, yeah.  Because otherwise, you're right.  It's just the 14th is the 13th floor.  It's just dumb.  You could have one of those little Bing John Malkovich floors.  That's what I was thinking.  Those little tiny ones that you could just put in between. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, make it a tiny floor.  No one could be on it anyway.  It's in between the ceiling and the floor of the next thing.  Yeah.  But you just have the elevator go ding real quick.  At 13.  It's like ding.  Like the ceiling.  Ding, ding, ding.  The ceiling could be seven inches high.  Right.  You don't need-  That's it.  Did you like that movie?  It was weird.  I liked it.  I thought some-  The first time I saw it, I liked it.  Yeah.  It doesn't have much rewatchability.  But I thought it was kind of funny that they just get spit out on the side of the Jersey 
[01:02:00]  turnpike.  Really strange shit.  Yeah, very odd.  That's a pot-smoking movie, huh?  Yeah.  All right.  We're babbling.  We're on babbling.  Joe DeRozan next.  We got the Ricky Gervais at 930.  And no Jim Gaffigan.  And fuck Jim Gaffigan.  Oh, no.  We're good with him.  Oh.  Yes.  Where is he, though?  He's out of town.  We're out of town.  How far?  Some of our guys, they drive all the way back from Philly just to do the show.  That's crazy.  Some of the guys have driven from Boston to do the show and then go back.  Boston. 
[01:02:30]  He's an airplane away.  You sure?  If he's not an airplane away, I say fuck Jim Gaffigan today.  I'm 38% sure.  All right.  Fair enough.  Bill Burklip or no?  I have it there.  Are we still on?  You teased it and then you didn't do anything.  Well, I can't push any buttons from here.  You have my computer on?  Yeah.  You kind of have to.  There you go.  He said Bill Burklip.  Bill Burklip or no?  Bill Burklip.  No, we were watching it the other day. 
[01:03:00]  You know, Oprah's on there.  She's interviewing some clam.  You know.  And, uh, she's giving her this big ridiculous intro.  Like, she's done this.  She's done that.  She's done this.  And she does the most difficult job on the planet.  She's the mother.  And continues on immediately.  I just look at my girlfriend like, pfft.  You know, like, really?  Being a mother is the most difficult job on the planet.  Oh, yeah.  All those mothers who die every year from black lung, from inhaling all that coal dust. 
[01:03:30]  The women are just constantly patting themselves on the back about how difficult their lives  are.  And no one corrects them because they want to f*** them.  Oh, that's what it is.  So there's just this tornado of, like, misinformation.  I had the most difficult job on the planet.  What would you rather be doing? 
[01:04:00]  Drilling to the center of the earth, shaking hands with the devil?  Every time there's a rumble in the ground, you wait for the whole thing to collapse down  on top of you so they can write that folk song about you?  You know?  Would you rather be up in the sunshine running around with a couple of toddlers that you  can send to bed anytime you want on some sort of trumped-up charges?  Because you want to have a drink and watch The Price is Right?  You know what I mean?  I couldn't believe it.  It's the most difficult job on the planet. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  I thought roofing in the middle of July is a redhead.  I thought that that was difficult.  But these mothers are bending over at the waist, putting DVDs into DVD players.  I don't know how they do it.  I don't know how they do it.  Dude, any job that you can do in your pajamas is not a difficult job.  All right?  You break.  This question, 35 years old, playing hide-and-go-seek, you're living the dream. 
[01:05:00]  You're living the dream.  No time card, no taxes.  You're off the f***ing grid.  Making popsicle stick houses.  I mean, I'm...  It's the most difficult job on the planet.  Oprah's not even a mother.  How the f*** would she know?  Unbelievable.  Sirius XM.  And now, The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:05:30]  Wine is fine, but we're scarce work on.  Suicide is...  Oh, my God.  Now, now, now, now, now.  That's insanity.  It's a chore.  There's a show within a show happening.  Oh, yes.  Joe DeRosa in studio.  Hi, guys.  Joe DeRosa, man.  No, no, no.  Hold on.  E-Rock's trying to do something. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, is he?  That's not important.  Continue with what you're doing.  Whoa.  Excuse me.  Whoa.  Well, just why suicide is painless.  We can make it easy today.  It's not.  Suicide solution.  Suicide solution.  Oh, yeah.  Does this have to do with the PMRC?  Exactly.  From years ago?  What's that?  Oh, is that the thing on the records?  Yeah.  The Tipper Gore thing?  Is this the Tipper Gore thing, E-Rock? 
[01:06:30]  No, it's not.  Oh, shit.  Is it something to do with Ozzy?  No, it's not.  Is it something to do with suicide?  Yeah.  Is it the anniversary of the date of the trial, the Judas Priest trial, where the kids killed  themselves?  No.  I know what he's doing.  You know what he's doing?  Yuck.  The Dave Grohl thing?  No.  What?  Oh, excuse me.  Oh, well, fuck you, Opie.  Pretty much what E-Rock just said.  And he should.  I was a little cocky there.  He should. 
[01:07:00]  Really?  Not that.  Because the Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl, Kurt Cobain's daughter thing with the Courtney Love?  No?  No.  Courtney Love's claiming that Dave Grohl's been hitting on Frances Bean.  Oh, man.  What a twisted thing that is.  And Frances Bean is like my biological mother.  That's how she refers to Courtney, because she hates Courtney Love.  It's full of shit.  She was saying they should kick her off Twitter.  Right.  Because she just says dumb things that aren't true.  And then Dave Grohl came out and said it's not true as well.  How old is the Frances Bean?  The Frances Bean is 17 or 18, I think. 
[01:07:30]  Oh.  What's wrong with that?  Maybe 19 at this point.  She's cute, too.  She's got a sexy, like, rock club.  She looks too much like Kurt Cobain.  I didn't think.  I didn't say that.  That's cool.  Have sex with Kurt Cobain without it being weird.  What about the gay part?  What about the gay part?  Well, she's a girl, so it's not even gay.  But she kind of looks like it could be Kurt with some makeup on.  But that's fine.  I disagree.  I don't.  No, I think she looks more like Courtney.  Yeah.  I think she looks more like Courtney.  Come on.  Look at the eyes.  There's some Kurt in there. 
[01:08:00]  It's all about the eyes.  What's wrong with you guys?  Round fucking.  Look at the eyes.  That's not Kurt Cobain.  Oh, she's smoking right there.  That's Courtney.  Yeah, those shots are great.  Her mouth.  She's a mix between the two, but she definitely has Kurt Cobain's eyes.  Come on.  I don't know.  Thank you, Sam.  Jesus.  I never looked into Kurt Cobain's eyes that long.  Dude, everyone knew it.  All dreamy.  All right.  All right.  I know what's going to happen today.  All right.  I'm prepared for this.  All right, Joe.  Here we go. 
[01:08:30]  Here we go.  Fucking hilarious.  Like no one ever talked about Kurt Cobain's eyes before.  Fair enough, though.  No, in all seriousness, though, I really don't see any Kurt Cobain resemblance.  Wow.  I just see, yeah.  I'm not being a dick.  I really don't.  Hey, why the suicide solutions?  Oh, right.  Oh, Kevorkian was sentenced to prison 13 years ago.  He's, that's 13 years already? 
[01:09:00]  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  He's dead, right?  Yeah, he just died.  Yeah.  Yeah, right after they made that movie about him.  Right.  Yeah.  Which was a creepy movie.  Did you see that movie?  Yeah, that was fucking, yeah, very, he was just a creep.  He really was.  Al Pacino is, like, eccentric and weird enough.  I don't like when he plays, like, a weird guy in a movie.  Weird people, yeah.  Because it just, it makes it, it makes me not like Al Pacino.  I'm like, ugh, he's skeeving me out, man. 
[01:09:30]  It's not Michael Corleone here.  I don't like it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dr. Kevorkian, I got the death machine.  I'm trying to help these people kill themselves.  It's their God-given right.  Never gets old.  Oh, two things before we, uh.  But don't touch.  Touch it, but don't taste.  The best line in that movie is, uh, he goes, uh, where does he sleep? 
[01:10:00]  He doesn't sleep.  Where does he fuck?  Everywhere!  Right over the top Pacino guy.  What happened to the Godfather?  It's like, well, my father runs a business that, uh, you know, it's.  It is two different people.  It went from that guy, uh, I don't really think I like what's going on here.  I go, to this guy!  I go, to this guy!  Although, although his, his, one of his biggest overacting moments ever is in Dog Day Afternoon, 
[01:10:30]  when he walks up to the desk and he's got the gun in the rose box.  Yeah.  And he's like, the way he flips that gun out, he struggles with that button.  It's ridiculous.  Right?  There's like a fucking paper ribbon around it.  He's fucking wrestling.  And you know they just said, fuck it.  That's good enough.  Over the top Pacino.  I'll just use that one.  Uh, two things really fast, and then you got that queued up.  Um, there's a guy, cause we were talking about the 13th floor in buildings. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  One guy says that, uh, hold on a minute here, and where the fuck was it?  Oh, the Blakely Hotel on 55th Street has a 13th floor.  Mm-hmm.  It's the smoking floor.  So they did what we did.  We were talking about.  Oh, so no one really used it.  You have to have an actual floor that people don't have to fucking use.  Right.  And he goes, I fuck bitches there.  Oh, right.  Did he write, I fuck bitches there?  I fuck bitches there.  Everywhere!  On the 13th floor! 
[01:11:30]  We're talking about how the elevator, it's stupid that they don't have the 13th floor in  the elevator, but there is an actual 13th floor in a building, so the whole thing's dumb.  All they've changed are the numbers on the rooms, and when you open up the elevator, and  the elevator buttons numbers, but it's still the 13th floor.  This is a dumb question, I'm sure, but it's like, what, what, they just do that now out  of, like, wink-wink tradition, right?  I mean, it's so ridiculous. 
[01:12:00]  It's, yeah, you're twisting around a whole thing based on a superstition.  I mean, Ann said, Ann actually came up with this, and said we should make a 13th floor,  but a tiny little floor.  Make it in between the floors.  Like being John Malkovich?  Yeah, yeah, but even smaller.  Just one that's in between the floors.  So the elevator goes like, ding, ding, ding.  You know, like, it just passes it real quick.  And what would happen?  But no one really uses the 13th floor.  It's just like the joists in between the floors.  The what?  I don't know these terms.  You know, like, in between the ceiling here, and the floor on the next floor, there's like 
[01:12:30]  a little place for machinery and floor joists, and, you know, like, mechanical shit.  That's what that's called?  I never knew what that was called, like, in the movies when they're, like, chasing through  the elevator shaft.  I was like, oh, what's, there's the gears.  We're going to have to put a cubicle on that floor, though, Ann, to make it official.  To make it official?  A cubicle, a desk, maybe something.  Yeah.  One light?  I don't know.  And the other thing is, we're not going to say fuck Jim Gaffigan anymore, because I  guess he's in L.A.  No, he's in L.A. 
[01:13:00]  Or is it fuck Jim Gaffigan?  He didn't cancel.  No fuck Jim Gaffigan?  No.  I think his publicist fucked up by saying he was going to be in town.  And, Joe, what were you saying down the hall?  It was so funny, because when you're waiting to go on air, you sit in a little office space  with Roland.  Yes, what a treat.  It's wonderful.  Yeah.  And the show is piped into the room, but the show's only coming out of the right side  of the room, where the speakers are.  So, in your right ear, you hear the show, and on your left ear, you hear everything 
[01:13:30]  Roland's doing.  So, in my right ear, I hear Opie going, fuck Jim Gaffigan.  Fuck him.  These fucking people have driven from Boston to the show.  Fuck Jim Gaffigan.  And then out of my left ear, I hear Roland pick up the phone and dial up to the studio  and go, he's in L.A.  He's in L.A.  He's in L.A.  There was a misunderstanding.  So fucking funny.  I hear you're in a shit mood today, Joe DeRosa.  That can be good for this show.  It's always good.  I like when people are in shit moods. 
[01:14:00]  It fuels me, man.  It fuels me.  It's been fucking stressful, man.  Why?  A lot of stress.  Are you moving to L.A.?  That was the last I heard from you.  I'm not moving to L.A.  All right, good.  I am going back to Pennsylvania for a little while, because I've got some family stuff  happening, and I've got to help some, I don't want to say too much, but I've got to help  somebody in my family get through some stuff.  So I have to commute from Pennsylvania to New York for a little while for work, and I've  got to move.  It's just so stressful. 
[01:14:30]  That is stressful.  You're moving out of that joint?  Yeah, I'm moving out of my apartment, because I want to be able to be home-based in PA to  help my family.  It's only for two months, but I mean, it's going to be a tough commute.  Yeah.  That sounds selfish.  I'm not saying like, oh, poor me.  I don't mean it like that.  I just mean like, it's just, it's a stressful time.  Yeah, yeah.  Do you have a one-legged brother?  No, what does that mean?  I'm getting at something here.  Oh, okay. 
[01:15:00]  Because there's another friend of ours that is being forced to help a family member, and  he's bitching about the whole fucking thing.  Unlike you, you're doing the right thing, moving back to Philly to make sure you're close  and do the right thing.  Yeah.  Rich Voss, on his last podcast, was bitching and complaining.  I called him up, because it made me fucking howl, because I don't know his brother.  So to me, it's just pure comedy.  He's bitching and complaining, because he has to drive his one-legged brother around for  a while to do chores and shit. 
[01:15:30]  And he was bitching?  And he's bitching, and then Bonnie's like, you're bitching because you have to drive your  one-legged brother around?  It was some fine podcast, and I must admit.  That just means...  It was the last podcast, if you want to check it out.  My wife hates me.  I will side with Bonnie forever now, and every argument they ever had.  I have, after hearing that.  Yeah.  I used to...  The jury used to be out once in a while with me.  I'd be like, yeah, I don't know.  They're both making good points, you know?  Right.  Or, Rich is right this time.  I'm never going to side with him ever again.  He complained about trying to help his crippled fucking brother?  Well, he brought it up, and he made it... 
[01:16:00]  He was talking about it like, oh, God, what a fucking hassle this is, and oh, God.  And Bonnie's like, you're bitching about helping out your one-legged brother?  And Rich is the kind of guy, too, where he'd be like, what a hassle to...  And he'd be like, God, Rich.  And he'd be like, well, no, I don't mean it like that.  Yeah.  Well, how do you mean it then, Rich?  Right.  Wow.  Not what I'm saying.  Right.  And then when he tries to explain shit, it makes it even better.  It made me howl, though.  It's a good listen if you want to check out a podcast. 
[01:16:30]  All right.  I'll check that out.  I'll check that out.  And let me...  If I may say this, gentlemen...  Yes, yes.  Monday is when I officially go back to PA, and just coincidentally, Roland called and  said, can you come in on Friday?  So I feel like this is like...  Oh, man.  This was like Synergy or something.  I was like, oh, I hope I get to do the show again.  Well, this is your last appearance on the show.  Yeah, this is it.  We figured, you know, we'll give you one good one before you move to PA and no one  hears from you.  Joe's become kind of my... 
[01:17:00]  Because PA is a hotbed of comedy...  A New York drinking buddy.  ...comedian activity.  Well, I'm not...  But I'm coming...  I'm going to commute, and I'm coming back.  Oh, my God.  I got it.  We got it.  Name some of those big comics in PA right now.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't stress enough.  This is just a temporary thing.  I'll commute, and then I'll be back in two months.  Don't give up, Joe.  You're too many friends.  Are you giving up?  He's giving up.  I remember Fred said that in sixth grade, too.  No, I'm moving, but we'll, you know...  Yeah, we'll be in touch.  We'll still be able to hang out.  Oh, Jesus.  Last time you saw him, right?  Last time you saw him. 
[01:17:30]  Fred goes to camp.  That was it.  John McCullough.  Yeah, yeah.  I got one.  John McCullough was my best friend.  Hey, we're moving to Michigan, but, you know, we're going to come back to Long Island a lot.  Oh, really?  I've never heard from him again.  Opie.  It's been 20-some-odd years.  There'll be another time.  Anthony, you have to protect him now.  You know what?  Empire Strikes Back?  Come on.  Comedy.  All I'm saying, Joe, is when I think stand-up comic, comedy...  You think Philly?  I think Philly.  Let me talk about the...  It's perfect for you.  Fucking Philly, motherfucker! 
[01:18:00]  Let me talk about the great Philly comedians.  Yeah.  All right?  Keith Robinson.  No, but those guys are living...  But he's sort of a New Yorker.  I know.  He comes up every night, so he's kind of like...  You know what I'm saying.  No, he doesn't live there anymore.  I just thought you...  All I'm saying is make sure it's only the two months.  You scare me.  Also, you need to get comfortable.  Like, you know what?  Funny.  No, no.  I have to...  I like the Amish.  I have to be back in...  Slow lifestyle.  Right.  I have to be back in by late June for work stuff.  Like, I have stuff on the books. 
[01:18:30]  It's like, I cleared out these two months to be able to do this, and...  Why are you standing?  To make the point better?  Because, I don't know.  I just started feeling like my career was falling apart, so I wanted to stand up.  Oh, man!  And I heard what Ant said, because we were sort of like, had two things going on at the  same time.  You know, Ant's going to lose a drinking buddy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm in the city.  It's Joe DeRosa.  Head out to the bar.  Yeah.  This is the beauty of it now, though, is because it's going to be an intense time at home, 
[01:19:00]  like, without question.  So, now it's like, but now I'm going to have a car.  So, what I'll do now is, I'll just drive to Long Island to hang out with you.  Well, you could do that, sure.  Like, I'll get to a point where I'm like, I need to drive five hours or whatever it is  today to just go hang out and blow off some steam.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, it'll...  That eats up 10 hours of time just driving, though.  Yeah, but I'll get up at like 8 a.m. 
[01:19:30]  I'll be well rested because I won't be hanging out at all.  You know?  That's true.  He's basically saying he's going to crash at your place.  Well, of course he will.  Yeah.  Of course.  And, Opie, you know, I'm going to miss you, too.  I mean, we never really drank together, but, you know, we did...  Joe's a good one to drink with.  We would do walkings.  We would do walkings.  That sounds just as cool as drinking all night.  Yeah.  We'd walk.  We'd walk and check out the brutes.  Talks and things.  It was always nice.  Yeah.  Joe, don't fuck this up.  I won't.  I'll be back. 
[01:20:00]  You're too good.  You just need a big break.  I'll come in and do a...  You're so close all the time.  It's...  Listen, there's...  Trust me.  There's stuff on the books.  There's things in the pipe.  This is like...  Yeah, there's things in the pipe.  Things are happening.  This was...  I was...  I feel very lucky that I was able to clear out eight weeks to help my family, you know,  and get through this tough period.  So, it's like, you know, I'm lucky that I was able to do that and not go on, can't make  it home, guys.  I gotta...  Yeah.  You know, I gotta go to... 
[01:20:30]  You're a good egg.  You're a good egg, Noonan.  That's good.  You know, karma will help you.  Then you'll get back, you'll start doing things, and you'll be like, you know what?  He's a good guy.  Nah.  You know.  You're a miserable fuck, but...  Exactly.  I'll come up and do the...  I'll come do the show, too.  Like, it's only a two-hour...  Like, I would get up at 4 a.m. and drive in to do it.  Oh, we'll decide that, Joe.  Oh, Jesus.  What a prick.  You're right.  I deserve that.  Hey, guys, don't worry. 
[01:21:00]  I'm at your disposal.  And, Mr. Faber-Sham, I'll have it put in my contract that I must return here to put  on the play every year.  Let the record stay.  We love Joe on this show.  I, uh...  People take this stuff seriously for whatever reason.  Oh, God.  You guys are the greatest, man.  Are you kidding me?  Do you know how excited I was walking over here today?  You're going to be able to wake up much too early and hang out.  I was just...  I was like, I know I'm going to go laugh my balls off for three hours.  You know, and already...  I feel like we're really off to a good start today. 
[01:21:30]  I know.  We really are, yeah.  Especially during the commercial break.  Whoa.  Wow.  We laugh and laugh.  I can't keep up with that.  It's life.  Yeah.  It's fun.  It's fun.  It sounds like it.  It's fun.  I'm not even joking.  And summer hasn't even started, my friend.  So, is that why you're in a shit mood?  What?  Because of summer?  No, the family stuff and...  Oh, oh.  Yeah, I just...  It's just... 
[01:22:00]  I have movers coming on Monday.  I haven't packed a thing yet.  Oh, man.  And, you know, it's been two weeks.  I had work...  I had to get things done that were time sensitive,  and I had to get them done more quickly because I'm going to be not here.  So, it was like I had to get a lot done over the last two weeks.  I've only been back for two...  I was on the road for three weeks straight, and then I came back.  I had two weeks to, like, get everything in order.  And then also, too, you want to kind of say hi and see everybody and go,  hey, you know, I won't see you for a few weeks. 
[01:22:30]  You know what I mean?  So, uh...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  So, how are you going to move back to New York if you're getting rid of your place?  I'm going to move into a new place, which I wanted to do anyway.  This really...  Do you have a new place?  No.  I'll start looking for a new place about a month out.  Yeah.  What?  I'm worried.  What are you worried about?  No, what are you worried about?  Don't get comfortable.  I'm going to make them stand up again.  No.  All right, you got a plan.  Yeah, trust me.  This is like a concrete plan.  I'm going to... 
[01:23:00]  I don't worry enough to invite you to live with me for a while.  I know.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  I know.  And I do have a few extra rooms.  This is why I don't have a new place yet, is because this is how I'm going to do it.  I always want to do the thing that I see people do in movies.  I'm going to come up for a day with cash in my pocket.  Oh, right.  And I just want to be staring out the window with my arms right back and go, I'll take it.  I always wanted to do that.  A giant loft.  A giant loft where they're just looking up and going, I'll take it. 
[01:23:30]  God, yeah, that's...  Ugh.  That never happens.  You know what always bothers me about that scene?  You know the character can't afford that apartment.  Yeah, that's always the biggest thing, too.  Like, when you see Friends, none of them had a job that could pay for that shit.  I know.  It's really...  It really...  Friends infuriates me to watch.  Actually, you know what?  Friends was a good one, but it happens in...  Sorry.  It happens in a lot of movies, too, where you go, this character is like a cab driver or 
[01:24:00]  whatever the fuck.  They can't afford this place.  Yeah.  He'll make a couple grand, and all of a sudden, it's like they do that, like, moving on up  montage where he gets the new place.  And it's like...  Yeah, just one time, I'd like to see the broker be like, will you take it?  Your credit sucks.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  Your credit sucks.  You were homeless yesterday.  Right.  Do you have six months in advance?  Do you have...  What?  Well, I was telling you the other day that I saw...  I found these apartments. 
[01:24:30]  I almost was ready to just go, I want to rent this now, but I didn't have time to go out  there and look at it, but I found these places in Long Island City that are like, I don't  want to live in Long Island City, but these apartments are so ridiculous that I want to  live in Long Island City.  Roland's living there.  It's up and coming.  You should really look at it.  And it's a quick subway ride.  I'm telling you.  There's a lot of people moving there because it's cheaper.  You get more for your fucking money.  I found these apartments.  They literally look like American psycho apartments. 
[01:25:00]  You know what I mean?  All glass.  Brand new floor-to-ceiling window.  Whole wall is just window.  And it overlooks Manhattan, yeah.  Looking at the city.  Dude, insane.  Just gorgeous.  Everything's brand new.  Doorman, gym in the building.  Laundry on every floor.  Every amenity you could want to live in this.  It's happening.  Awful city.  To live in what amounts to a horrible place in Queens.  Yeah, Roland bailed because he got more for his money. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, great.  Now we have to deal with fucking Instagram pictures of Manhattan skylines every fucking  day from Roland.  Wow, great.  Another one of the statue of the Empire State Building.  Thanks, Roland.  Well, you could just unfollow him.  Well, no.  I like goofing on him.  Well, there you go.  It's that or Bruce.  But it's like...  Oh, go ahead.  Oh, I was just going to say, I don't mind the commute from Long Island City.  It's the neighborhood...  When you...  The boroughs are great in so many ways, but every borough's got the same problem. 
[01:26:00]  It's like, this block is cool, and then the next block, it's like, this looks like  where they shot the fly.  This is fucking creeping me out.  Like, Jesus Christ, warehouses and plywood over a deli with graffiti on it and shit like  that.  It's like, that's the part...  That makes me depressed to see that.  Like, I don't want to...  But that shit is all going to turn around.  Oh, boy.  When?  Yeah, how long?  That's what they said about Harlem, and I lived up there for two and a half years.  The Renaissance.  The Harlem Renaissance. 
[01:26:30]  You were the white guy in Harlem?  No, maybe like where the Apollo Theater is.  I was on 137th and Broadway for a long time.  And they...  It wasn't bad.  It was just like, they kept being like, it's coming, it's coming.  And by like, it's coming, it's coming up, they would mean like, yeah, there's six shithole  99 cent stores in between liquor stores, in between Kennedy Fried Chickens, and then in  the middle of all that, there'd be like a bistro. 
[01:27:00]  A bistro.  Oh, that's great.  Just waiting for the doors to fly open with armed robbers.  Did you ever get hassled up there, Joe?  Never.  I lived in a very...  Like, Harlem's a great place because it's very communal.  Like, if you're in the neighborhood, it's like you're in the neighborhood.  Oh, okay.  If you're not there, if you're not there being like cunty in any way, like clearly trying  to gentrify it, or like, or just being like, ugh, you know, like, if you just, hey, I'm 
[01:27:30]  part of this, like, it's, it's, everybody's cool.  It doesn't matter who you are.  And like, we had crack dealers on my corner, literally, every night.  That's sweet.  And I would literally walk through, like, their crack dealing circle, and they were  always like, hey, man, how you doing?  Like, they never, like...  That's nice.  Yeah, it was always just like, hey, you're doing your job.  Why roust you and make a problem, you know?  It's like, eh, they just...  Yeah, it was never...  They're going about their business.  It's not good for business.  They never offered me crack, either.  Ah, fuckers.  They just... 
[01:28:00]  They were like, yo, man, what you need?  Never, never.  They were just like, yeah.  They never gave you a little free sample?  Wow.  They probably thought you were 5-0, yo.  They probably thought you was 5-0.  Son.  Son.  Did you guys ever...  You guys never did crack, right?  I never did crack.  Jesus.  I never did it.  I mean, it's...  I wonder what it...  I smoked a little Freebase, but not crack.  You smoked Freebase?  Yeah.  Is that the same thing?  No, God, please.  Crack is for those people. 
[01:28:30]  Freebase is for, you know...  Whitey?  That's...  It's not that little fucking rock of thing.  It's a powder.  It's much like...  What is that high like?  Because it always looks like it would be like a heroin high.  People are always like, ugh.  But it's coke.  I don't understand why it's not...  It is odd.  It's very euphoric, is what it is.  And you do get that immediate rush where, I guess, I've never done heroin.  But when you see somebody that does heroin, they get that kind of whoosh, rush over them.  You do kind of get that. 
[01:29:00]  But you are...  But it's not speedy.  No, it's not as speedy as just doing, like, snorting coke.  But it is kind of like...  Because that's all...  Coke is all speedy.  There's never euphoria.  It's just like...  Oh, because it's cut with all sorts of shit, too.  Right, right.  This is pretty...  They stomp on it way too much.  It's the purest thing.  And you don't make it with heat at all.  It's not made with heat.  It's made with ether, ammonia, water, and coke.  You mix it all together in the proper proportions.  You dump in your coke.  You shake it up. 
[01:29:30]  And then it separates.  And then you take the eyedropper and you go into the layer that's just the ether.  And you take some out and you sprinkle it on a slate.  And then you go...  And it dries instantly and evaporates the ether.  And what's left is this residue of white powder.  You scrape that up.  You throw it in your little pipe.  You melt it into the screen.  And then...  Woof.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  How do you know how to do that? 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  I learned it from somewhere.  I would fuck it up, I think.  I would fuck up the steps.  He started that story by like...  I freebased once.  Yeah.  And then by the end of it, he's like, here's what you do.  The ether evaporates.  Yeah, let me tell you exactly what you do.  Well, it was made in the house a few times.  A few times.  Back in the 80s.  It sounds like you have to be a chemist to smoke the shit.  Well, it is.  Yeah, you do.  It was...  You did have to kind of know your chemistry.  That's...  Can we get Roland to come down the hall, by the way? 
[01:30:30]  Because you mentioned Roland and the Springsteen.  Oh, right.  How was that show?  You guys were tweeting about it like crazy.  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't there.  We went to...  I support this company.  Fuck them.  Me and Jimmy.  We went to the...  I was on vacation.  It was good.  You know, I'm not a Bruce fan.  I'm no Bruce fan.  I know, but your tweets, you were like, oh my God, this is unbelievable.  It was great.  It was really good.  The guy's...  He's no spring chicken.  But he was running around like a maniac.  And just... 
[01:31:00]  It sounded great.  When you have a...  You had 17 people on stage with him.  And it was just so full, the sound and everything.  And his voice sounds great.  He was singing songs that I don't fucking know what they were because he's not playing  Thunder Road, cocksucker.  Yeah, he doesn't play like the hits, right?  No.  He plays them when Roland goes, who's seen him 800 times.  And then when I go, I've never going to see him...  I've never seen him before.  I'm never going to see him again.  I have to get these new songs.  What the fuck?  Play Goddamn!  Because that was...  It was like the special event for the album.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop it and play fucking... 
[01:31:30]  No, it wasn't.  It was.  It could have been awesomer.  For a hardcore Bruce fan, it had to be awesome.  Yeah, it was.  How many times have you seen Bruce in the last couple weeks?  Five.  Five so far.  How many times total?  Five.  No.  Oh, total...  257?  Is that a real number?  257 times.  That's a real number.  Yeah.  I mean, I met a guy on the floor.  He was like over a thousand.  I worshipped him.  Wait, 257?  How is that possible?  From Born in the USA on...  I wouldn't see...  How old are you?  33? 
[01:32:00]  So you saw him the first time.  You were like six?  Yeah.  Born in the USA.  My mom took me.  Holy shit.  Wait, how old were you?  Like six.  She took me to see four...  Is that really that long ago?  Yeah.  Born in the USA?  Yeah, I was like 80...  You were six when that came out?  Yeah.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  When was that?  Child of the 80s.  80s.  Child of the 80s.  That's right.  He was a child of the 80s like us.  Back in time.  Wait, Born in the USA.  When did that come out?  Well, the tour was...  84 or something?  Yeah.  I remember that.  Oh, my...  Yeah.  I never liked Springsteen.  I was a big Michael Jackson guy. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Oh.  It's not my fault he stinks.  Oh, shit.  We're going to really miss you, Joe.  Oh, man.  No, I never...  No, I honestly have...  I have a lot of respect for the guy.  I just never...  I've tried over and over.  I can't get into his music.  I love that song.  Because you're gay.  Oh.  I'm gay. 
[01:33:00]  Is that necessary?  I'm not the guy into the guy from Jersey  who wears ripped jeans and a bandana around his leg.  Oh, shit.  Showing his ass with his head turned around.  Looking out.  Like, look at my ass.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, Roland.  Give me a reach around.  What?  Oh, shit.  That's going to hurt.  He did say he would blow Bruce Springsteen.  If Bruce Lee's loving him, I'm there.  And get fucked by him.  And get fucked by Bruce.  And the Rock. 
[01:33:30]  And the Rock.  And the Rock.  The Rock.  Because everybody loves the Rock.  We'll give you the boss, but the Rock, that's not me.  Oh, my God.  There was one Springsteen song.  There was a band I saw once.  They're called Broken Fingers.  And they covered this Springsteen song.  And it fucking...  It was...  Don't remember the song?  If you said the name.  Was it about Jersey?  It was just one of those Springsteen songs of like,  All we got is us and all we're going to do and... 
[01:34:00]  You know.  Blue-collar bullshit.  Blue-collar bullshit.  Yeah.  Why is it blue-collar bullshit for the people in that area?  First of all, Bruce...  Bruce wouldn't know blue-collar if it bit him in his jeaned ass.  When was the last time you understood blue-collar, you think?  Oh, please.  Oh, fuck.  It's just like Billy Joel.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, I'm so blue-collar.  One, two, three, four...  Shut the fuck up.  Destinator Truck and Asshole.  You've been rich since you were 19.  Go fuck yourself. 
[01:34:30]  One, two, one...  What...  Dude, what Billy Joel...  With the whistle going off?  Like he's a working guy.  Allentown.  Clang, da-na, da-na.  The fuck does he know?  Clang, da-na.  It's all right.  Dan-na.  Well, we're living here in Allentown.  Are ya?  There it is, the work whistle.  All right, everyone's getting off for work.  He's a working Joe.  Just like me.  Leaving the fucking factory with his lunchbox.  Oh, he just punched the clock, and he's mad at the foreman.  Exactly. 
[01:35:00]  And he opens the lunchbox, and it's got fucking Chardonnay and caviar in it.  What's fucking Billy Joel's song is that?  That is...  I was talking about this the other day with some of my friends.  I go, if there was one measure of music that pisses me off more than anything,  it's that fucking Billy Joel thing where he goes,  one, two, three, four...  He made our trust.  That's made our trust.  Oh, my God, dude.  It was a summer time.  Some love and what can love the heart.  The core remains to what began with a passionate start. 
[01:35:30]  Accounting's part of rock and roll, Joe.  What's wrong with the counting?  All the neighbors come out to see him.  The way he sings it, I just picture all these fucking, fucking liberal, fucking, you know,  do-gooders in the audience that love Billy Joel just feeling it.  Because you know what it is.  It's that goddamn comic relief audience.  Yeah.  It's the same fucking audience.  Going, oh, sing it to me, Billy. 
[01:36:00]  We're living tonight.  Well, it's just a question of when I've lived long enough to have learned.  Wow.  Oh, g'day.  Happened to us.  Cause it's always been a matter of trust.  Oh, then he went through his doo-wop face.  Oh, God, which one was that?  For the longest time.  Oh, God. 
[01:36:30]  For the longest time.  Whoa.  For the longest I have to.  Oh, Jesus.  How much would you like to see Billy Joel?  Bruce Springsteen just get jumped by a bunch of foremen.  By real men.  Bruce got jumped?  No, they performed together.  Oh, they did?  That must have been a treat for everyone.  It was, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Remember the Billy Joel and John tour where they sat ass to ass with those pianos on stage? 
[01:37:00]  Oh, great.  With a double-don dildo in their assholes.  How bummed was Elton John that they were ass to ass?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  He was hoping, you know.  Can't do anything that way.  That the teener part was next to his ass.  He's another guy that, like, Elton John...  I could never hear another Elton John song.  I wouldn't give a rat's fucking ass.  Really?  Some of those sing-alongs.  Which ones?  You don't like Philadelphia Freedom?  Ugh. 
[01:37:30]  I don't know.  Leave on.  The Crocodile song.  You don't like Goodbye Yellow Brick Road?  Oh, God, no.  He has a lot of sing-alongs.  Oh, God.  I like what Elton John song is.  I like, I'm still standing.  Still standing.  Oh, God.  That's like the worst one you could have picked.  Looking like shoes of art.  Are you still standing, billionaire?  Has the world been tough to you?  Have you had a tough run of it, Elton?  Oh, there you go. 
[01:38:00]  Oh, my God.  What about...  Can you feel the love of it?  Oh, my God.  Lion King.  Maybe he's celebrating because, you know, he lived through the whole...  The test results came back negative.  I'm still standing.  So maybe he's just celebrating the fact that he's still standing.  I got no car-soma.  You got to think that guy saw a lot of ace.  What the fuck am I saying?  Burr told me that he read a quote from Elton John once where he said,  it's literally just a stroke of luck that I made it through. 
[01:38:30]  He's like, I fucked half the free world.  I don't know how I didn't get anything.  How did he miss the AIDS?  Jesus Christ, dude.  Freddie Mercury gets it.  Freddie.  Damn.  Life's not fair.  That's just...  It's not.  We lose Freddie.  You lose...  Well, it...  Look, Queen stunk for that last seven-year stretch.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not saying, like, I don't...  I wish Freddie Mercury was still alive, obviously, but it's like,  Queen...  Do you imagine how shitty they would be now?  But the show must go on.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Jesus. 
[01:39:00]  They were the coolest fucking band ever.  Yeah.  And then in the 80s, all that shit with, you know,  where all the videos, they were just, like, white lit.  Yes.  Super close-ups.  Radio Gaga.  Is that the one?  I like Radio Gaga.  I'm not a big fan of the Radio Gaga.  I'm not a fan of the Radio Gaga.  Look at this.  Look at this video, dude.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  How gay is this video?  It was just men in bikinis.  And he's carrying that cane.  Oh, my God.  What's he doing with a straw hat? 
[01:39:30]  There he is.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's just celebrating that he made it through the 70s and 80s on Skane.  Oh, man.  It's so obvious now that you see the video.  He threw a party for himself.  Jesus Christ.  He basically wanted to say, holy fuck.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  Look at the gayness that's in this video.  Look at this.  This is hilarious.  I want to celebrate.  I'm going to dress up like Colonel Sanders.  Dance down the fucking boardwalk. 
[01:40:00]  I made it.  He made it.  He made it.  This fucking year did this come out?  This has got to be late 80s, probably.  And he's still in the 80s.  Fuck.  Oh, man.  After this video, he still had to make an official statement of going, I'm gay.  That he said, hey, look, everyone.  Who the fuck didn't know that?  I don't want to shake you all up here, but.  He's just prancing through men painted with painted bodies. 
[01:40:30]  Muscle men with painted bodies.  Oh, my God.  Is this gay?  How stupid were we?  We were dummies.  You would look at it like, oh, yeah.  Well, he's just being an artist, I guess.  Yeah.  I guess.  Oh, he's just, you know, the artist.  What's, oh, God, man.  He used women, but not in a sexual way.  They were kind of just peripheral.  Oh, yeah.  They're just there.  So, Elton, any ladies in your life?  When he's on the talk show.  What, Merv?  So, any ladies in your life? 
[01:41:00]  Two closeted queens just fucking pretending they're in the chair.  We always goof about Liberace.  When Liberace used to do Mike Douglas or Merv or something like that, it would be like,  So, Lee, when are you going to settle down?  When are you going to settle down?  Find a young lady for you.  Well, let me tell you, I'm still looking for one who's got his mother.  Yeah, the backstage.  Oh, God.  He's backstage with Merv.  They're doing the pre-interview.  Merv Griffin's got to take Liberace's cock out of his mouth long enough to go, listen, 
[01:41:30]  so I'm going to ask you about chicks when we get out there.  Just fucking be cool.  Just roll with it.  Yeah, you have an answer, right?  You have an answer.  You have an answer, right?  So, yeah, what's worse?  People believing Elton John wasn't gay and Liberace wasn't gay, or people believing Billy  Joel and Bruce Springsteen were actually blue-collar guys?  Working-class heroes.  Which is worse.  Which is, like, dumber, like, you're just dumb.  I'm going to, I mean, the gay thing's obvious, but I think they're both pretty fucking... 
[01:42:00]  It is.  I just can't...  I don't know.  What did he do?  What did they do?  Did Bruce ever hold down a working blue-collar job?  Well, I mean, bar bands, yeah.  No, that's not a job.  He's been famous since how old?  Yeah.  They started at 17.  And Billy Joel was in fucking bars playing his dumb piano the whole time.  Sing us a song, you're the piano man.  Man.  They get it.  Oh, my God.  It's nine o'clock on a Saturday.  Oh, the anthem of the piano bar. 
[01:42:30]  Who gives a shit?  I know.  Piano...  And then you go to a piano bar, and it's like...  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  It's playing ragtime.  It's the shittiest...  It's the shittiest...  Piano bars in the shittiest fucking places.  They're depressing.  Oh, my God.  It's never smoky and cool.  No.  It's never like...  The microphone never smells like a beer.  And the microphone smells like a beer.  And the piano sounds like a carnival.  No, it doesn't.  It probably smells more like puke.  Yeah.  Because these guys are so miserable, they're probably puking in the fucking... 
[01:43:00]  It smells like old ladies' nylons.  Yeah.  Dude, I hate this fucking song.  Why?  It's the...  It brings you back to an innocent time.  Oh, does it?  I hate this song.  A time of innocence.  The only song worse than this is...  Scenes from an Italian restaurant?  Oh, you know, I like that.  Prendering lady with a party with daddy.  And the king and the queen of the prom.  Scenes from an Italian restaurant.  Riding around with the car top down and the radio on.  Dirt, dirt, dirt.  How the fuck do you know that?  I know everything. 
[01:43:30]  But Joe...  Joe knows a lot of Billy Joel songs, I'm noticing.  There's someone that hates the man.  I...  I...  What about Scenes from an Italian restaurant?  I hate that fucking song.  A bottle of red.  A bottle of white.  Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight.  You know what?  What about Captain Jack?  We'll get you hiding.  Oh, my God.  I will throw a bottle of Jack at somebody.  You don't like that one?  Captain Jack, we'll get you by tonight.  Oh, it just sticks.  What about Billy the Kid?  No. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, God.  That shows off his piano playing.  Here's the...  Here are the Billy Joel songs I like.  I like Allentown.  Me, Stray Fire?  No.  I like Allentown.  Yeah, what if I just named...  I like River of Dreams.  I don't like...  Oh, my God.  All the shitty ones.  No, I like Allentown.  I like Movin' Out.  I like...  I like...  How about Only the Good Die Young?  That song's okay.  What about She's Got a Way About Her?  No, fuck that song.  His lovey-dovey songs. 
[01:44:30]  I like...  Fuck.  I like...  Boom.  Wait, how's it go?  Wait, the one that goes...  Boom.  New, new, new, new.  New, new, new, new.  Boom.  New, new, new, new, new.  See, he knows a lot about Billy Joel.  What song is that?  You may be right.  Yeah, yeah.  You may be right.  I love that song.  I think he kind of liked Billy Joel.  He's got a couple of Billy Joel songs he likes.  I like him, but I don't like him enough to not trash him.  You know what I mean?  It's one of those things.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  What's it?  How about it's still rock and roll to me?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no.  I don't like that song.  I was saying yeah like I know.  What about Just the Way You Are?  No.  Oh, God.  You don't like it when he slows it down.  Wasn't that song in Arthur?  No, that's.  Arthur.  How about Christopher Cross?  My life.  When you get caught between the noob and New York City.  How about.  I know it's crazy, but it's true.  What a thin-voiced fat man he was.  How about We Didn't Start the Fire? 
[01:45:30]  That song, there's a few songs shittier.  Is that the one with all the words?  Yeah.  Oh, you know what song I really hate by Billy Joel?  Pressure.  He knows every Billy Joel song.  And you cannot handle pressure.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  I hate that song.  What about Angry Young Man? 
[01:46:00]  How's that going to go?  E-Rock's going nuts trying to, by the time he finds a song, we're on to the third one.  Well, how's that?  What's Angry Young Man?  I never heard that one.  Well, it has a lot of piano in the beginning.  Oh, God.  Is this it?  No, this is pressure.  Pressure.  Pressure.  Pressure.  That awful 80s synth.  Oh, it is bad.  Sounds like horror movie music.  Yeah.  It's fucking horrific.  Oh, well, it's pressure.  Pressure.  Here it comes. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, pressure.  Oh, God, man.  You're just like everybody else.  Oh, I got it for you.  But he's got pressure.  What is it?  How about Big Shot?  Big Shot?  I like Big Shot up until the point where he goes,  You have to be a big shot.  Danger.  You have to be a big shot.  Why does he do that?  Yeah.  How douchey.  The third one where he goes,  I have to shut the song off.  I can't listen to it anymore.  Yeah, that's bad.  He does fuck with the words a little bit.  Because I want to be a big shot. 
[01:47:00]  Danger.  You know which one's good?  Here's a good Billy Joel song.  I really can't remember the names.  I'm sorry.  Danger.  Danger.  What?  Wait.  Turn down the music.  Let's try to guess this.  All those waiters in your...  Yeah, yeah.  You got that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, it's a name that tune.  Zanzibar.  Table where you...  Every dog must have his every day.  Don't ask me why.  Don't ask me why. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, don't ask me why is good.  Oh, and here...  Miami 2012.  Wait, what's Miami 2012?  He's going obscure.  This song's awesome, right?  For this one?  It was 2017, by the way.  2017.  He's had a lot of hits.  I'll tell you that much.  Holy shit.  And I drank a lot of take-home pay.  I thought I was a Duke of Earl.  When I made it with a red-haired girl in a Chevrolet.  Keeping the faith.  What?  Keeping the faith.  Is that keeping the faith?  Keeping the faith. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, God.  God, I love this song.  That song's awesome.  Oh, jeez.  That's another one of his...  Where he thought it was the 50s.  He's like...  Woo!  Same element.  He's dressed up in like a leather jacket in the video.  And he's dancing around.  Remember that video that started with him walking with the guys through like the basketball courts in Queens?  Where they're on their leather jackets.  And it's like, he's such a runty guy. 
[01:48:30]  I know.  You're not a tough guy, Billy.  Yeah.  He did drive his car into a house, though.  Yes.  I'll give him that.  A couple of times he's gone off-roading inadvertently.  He likes a few drinks.  He likes a few drinks.  After some of that old Long Island wine out of the fucking vineyards out east.  A bottle of red.  Another bottle of red.  And another bottle of red.  And another bottle of red.  Wait.  Drive my car through somebody's house tonight. 
[01:49:00]  Ah, shit.  Yeah, dude.  It's...  But even that.  Even like the fucking...  I'm gonna get...  Like, I'm a drunk that drives my car into people's houses.  It's still wine.  Yeah.  It's still not even like a whiskey, beer.  He's not driving around with a case of Pabst in the backseat.  Right.  Fucking just...  Yeah.  Just downing him on the fucking parkway.  Dude, it's fucking Chardonnays.  Yeah.  He drove into your house.  He's drinking fucking $120, $150 bottles of wine and driving into people's houses. 
[01:49:30]  Ah, shit.  Fuck, this is great.  Jesus fucking...  You don't like where he slows it down, huh?  Well, give me some more of the slowdowns.  You gotta sing it, though.  My Life.  My Life.  I like that song.  The Bosom Buddy song.  The Bosom Buddy song.  Yeah, Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari are fucking juggling that fruit in the market.  Remember that?  He's throwing the fucking fruit back.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking great is Tom Hanks.  How he went from that? 
[01:50:00]  Literally, they're like, Tom, just fucking...  It's for the opening montage.  Just...  Yeah.  Just...  Like, you're picking out fruit.  Fucking guys, fucking juggling.  Juggling.  Charisma just off the fucking charts.  Immediately.  That guy is fucking amazing.  Ah, he had something.  I wish he would do comedies again.  Did we do Uptown Girl?  For a second.  Isn't that the one?  But I'd like to trash Uptown Girl. 
[01:50:30]  That was the one his ex was in.  What's her name?  Yeah, yeah.  She was in that.  Christy Brinkley.  Christy Brinkley, sure, yeah.  Uptown Girl.  She's been living in a white bread world.  Well, that's a good one because it shows him being a blue collar.  Oh, he's working at the gas station.  And she's a supermodel.  And she's a supermodel, but he gets her because he's such a cool guy.  Right.  Well...  After they do some choreography together.  Right?  Oh, God.  The garage guys put...  They're twisting nuts on the car to the music. 
[01:51:00]  Twisting nuts to the red singing backup.  Billy Joe.  Oh, my God.  He's got a poster.  He's popping his collar on his work shirt.  There is no fucking way he's not wearing makeup to look more Puerto Rican in this fucking video.  There is no...  Look how fucking tan he is right there.  He's literally dancing.  Yeah.  This is hilarious.  I forgot how bad his videos were.  Jesus Christ.  That makes up her mind. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, here she comes.  When the fuck did mechanics and blue collar guys ever do this?  Where does this, like, this, like, this, like, this, like, this, like, this, like, blue collar man fucking idea come from?  They're singing it to their wrenches.  I've been to a few garages in my day, Joe, and never joined in dancing with the boys with the fucking socket wrenches.  The fucking most homophobic, miserable people in our...  And they're all dancing together and singing. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, he's making his move.  There he goes.  Hey, this is a nice car.  She's in a fucking Rolls Royce.  Oh, yeah.  The uptown girl.  The end of this video should be her peeling out in the limo.  Yeah.  And him just in the parking lot going, you fucking cunt.  Yeah, fucking cunt.  Goddamn rich cunt.  What, you're too good for me?  Now she's out of the car, showing off her games.  Oh, but they're gentlemen.  They're gentlemen. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, yeah.  These guys would be saying the most disgusting shit to her.  Oh, man, she's got fucking blowjob lips.  Look at her fucking ass.  I buried balls deep in that fucking ass.  But, no, they're cutely following her around.  Oh, Jesus.  And he's got the fucking black...  The black chauffeur.  He's the driver, of course.  Jesus Christ.  It was a different time, Joe.  I call it the good old days.  You can still get away with that shit.  Oh, and then they've got to get the black guys in the half-shirts dancing.  Half-shirts? 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  All right.  You going to dance?  Well, he was trying to compete with Elton John in his videos.  Oh, my God.  This is horrible.  What is this?  Grease lightning from Grease?  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.  That's another one.  It's like, when the fuck did gang...  Gorilla.  Ridiculous.  Oh, look.  See, this guy's doing the robot.  Two young black men.  They're popping.  How racist was Hollywood?  Oh, God.  We've got to put black guys in this video about the 50s.  Just make them breakdance.  Let's have breakdance.  Jesus Christ.  Now they do horrible dancing. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, God.  I'd like to see this fall on her face.  She's leaving with him.  Did we just listen to that whole song?  I think we did.  Oh, Jesus.  Holy shit.  Oh, we hate Billy Joel.  We hate him.  We watched the video.  We fucking hate him.  We got a visual medium.  I have a real love-hate with this guy.  I like that.  I can tell.  The songs I love, I love.  And the ones I hate, it piss me off.  They actually anger you, yes.  Yeah.  Unlike a guy like, you know...  I'm that way with Phil Collins, too, man.  There's certain songs that I love and certain songs I hate. 
[01:54:00]  But then there are guys like...  I hate that.  Ha-ha.  Ha.  Ugh.  I like that.  No, I hate that part.  It's Mama.  I like it.  That part, to me, is like the Billy Joel part.  You got to see him do it.  No, I hate that.  You got to see him do it live.  It's awesome.  No, it's not.  He puts a red light on his face.  Of course he does.  It's so creepy.  I saw it in the video.  Let's play Mama.  Ma.  Oh.  Yeah.  I kind of like that song.  I love that song.  I'm not going to download it anytime soon, but I like it.  This is Susudio.  When he started doing fucking, like, the covers, you can't hurry. 
[01:54:30]  It's like, dude, how are you the guy that wrote In the Air Tonight?  Like, how are you the same fucking guy?  He's miserable, too.  Ugh.  He's not a happy man.  We met him.  He still has a little strip of hair in the middle.  He's pissed.  He's shitty.  Is he cool?  No, he sucks.  He looks miserable.  Which I was bummed about, because I kind of liked some Genesis growing up and Phil Collins.  Yeah, his daughter's more famous.  Huh?  His daughter is an actress.  Who's his daughter?  What?  Lily Collins.  His daughter, as I just heard it, his daughter. 
[01:55:00]  Lily Collins?  His daughter's actress.  That's what he said.  His daughter's actress.  His daughter's actress.  It's one word.  Lily Collins.  His daughter's actress.  What's his face doing?  His rolling character today.  Bartlett on iTunes.  Bartlett.  I don't know.  What character is that?  He's doing Ringo Starr.  He's been doing that lately.  It's hilarious.  What's she in, though?  The Blind Side in the new Mirror Mirror movie.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, that's her?  She's the, she plays Cinderella?  Hey, which one is she?  Do we know her?  If we saw her face? 
[01:55:30]  Who is she in The Blind Side?  Bill Collins.  The daughter.  Right.  What?  What?  Who's another good?  Did we know that?  Oh, man.  We know her.  That's Bill Collins' daughter?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  How did we not know that?  Oh, wait.  She looked like 22 in the one picture.  Now she looks like she's 15 in every other 30s.  She's in Problem?  How old is she?  89.  That's good.  Once they're in the 80s, that's fine.  Fair game. 
[01:56:00]  She's 23, I guess.  Who's another good, like, love-hate?  Like, there's so many guys, like, you know who I just hate and I have no good reason to?  Van Morrison just bugs the shit out of me.  Oh, you don't like Van Morrison?  No.  I don't like him.  What's wrong with you?  Brown-Eyed Girl.  I have three...  Well, he probably hates Brown-Eyed Girl.  He goes a lot deeper than that shit.  Do you have some...  Into the Mystic?  You don't like that song?  What's that song?  That one.  That's good one.  What's that one?  Sing it for us.  You know Into the Mystic.  I can't sing.  You have to sing now.  That's why it's fun, though. 
[01:56:30]  And if it's your first time, it's Sing Club.  Into the Mystic.  Let it rip.  What is it, an Irish folk song?  I'm digging it.  Here, turn this up.  This is a great song.  We should go to break with this.  Lay, lay, lay, lay.  You know this song.  Lay across my big breast bed.  Carefree highway.  Exactly.  This is 20 songs.  Who sang that one?  Gordon Lightfoot.  Gordon Lightfoot. 
[01:57:00]  Fucking greatest.  Oh, that's hilarious.  We're sacrilegious.  We can't fucking talk over Into the Mystic.  We can talk over all this shit.  I don't know this.  This is real shit.  I don't know this song.  You know this song.  I don't know this song.  Pause this shit.  The frames covered it.  Huh?  I don't know it.  The frames covered it.  Do they?  That's good.  Wow.  It just sounds like a song you'd make fucking oatmeal to.  I don't know.  If I'm going to listen to shit like this, I'll listen to fucking some kind of southern rock.  Into the Mystic is a strong song.  I would bet he hates Marshall Tucker. 
[01:57:30]  I'd rather listen to Marshall Tucker.  That sounds a little like some of this stuff, but only a little rocky.  More rocking.  I respect Van Morrison.  I know it's me, not him.  You know what I mean?  That's what I was saying.  For some reason, I just can't get into him.  But most musicians really respect Van Morrison.  Yo, yeah.  Well, it's like Dylan.  People love Dylan.  I can't fucking listen to him.  I cannot do it.  Bill Burr had a great Dylan bit on his podcast.  About what?  Just fucking how the songs go on forever. 
[01:58:00]  It's the...  He sings about all the girls he fucked.  And one song.  We should find that clip if you can get it from Bill Burr's podcast.  Patrice.  Patrice called me one time.  What is that?  Marshall Tucker?  Gonna take a freight train.  Down to the station log.  I don't care where it goes.  Who is this?  Marshall Tucker.  Marshall Tucker band.  I don't know this song.  I like that song.  You don't know Marshall Tucker? 
[01:58:30]  I like that song a lot.  I know that one.  I don't know that song.  What other Marshall Tucker songs?  What's some of them other Marshall Tuggers on?  I'm trying to remember.  Um.  Uh.  Yeah.  There goes...  Oh, no.  Was that There Goes Another Love Song?  No, that was The Outlaws, right?  Take the highway.  Oh, please don't wait for me too long.  I'll be down on a...  I'm embarrassed that I don't know this.  Time has finally come for me to pack my bags and walk away.  Give me the songs and we'll figure it out.  Oh, there they are.  Oh, yeah.  Can't you see? 
[01:59:00]  Can't you see?  Yeah, we got Can't You See?  Oh, can't you see?  Heard it in a long time.  Well, that woman, what's she been doing to me?  Do they sing, whoa, whoa, let's do the music?  That's the doobie run.  Let's do this.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I like the doobie run.  All the time.  Yeah.  I like the doobie run.  I like a little Michael McDonald once in a while, too.  Oh, minute, bah, minute, bah, minute, bah, minute, bah, minute.  He's another...  Michael McDonald's another great one.  That's a perfect love-hate guy.  Oh.  The songs that are awesome, you're like, this song is a shit.  And then when it stinks, you want to throw your fucking radio out the window. 
[01:59:30]  Michael McDonald's another great one.  The wild man has the power.  He does that fucking shit.  Is that the real lyric?  That's not what he says.  I don't know what it is.  People say that that's what he says.  Really?  Yeah, but that can't be the lyric.  It might be.  The white man has the power.  No, the wise man.  Oh, oh.  The white man has the power.  The white man has the power.  I like it better that way.  Of course he does. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, people have said to me that they think that's what he says.  I'm like, that can't be what the fuck he's saying.  Let's listen to it real quick.  The reason I wait.  What?  Keep telling me somewhere I've been long ago.  The best Michael McDonald song is the one that Warren G sampled.  The one that goes, I keep forgetting I'm just loving it anymore.  It might be more fun than Michael McDonald impressions.  I keep forgetting I will never be the same again.  He looks like that fucking snowman that Burl Ives plays. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, God damn.  Nice.  Nice.  Horrible.  Holy shit.  We probably should break, unfortunately.  God damn, that's so funny.  We're rolling.  What a fool will you tell me the white man has the power.  I love it.  I love it.  I got it.  I want a break, but a band, because you said that are either really cool or annoy the fuck 
[02:01:00]  out of you.  Steely Dan.  Oh, Steely Dan.  Steely Dan.  Yeah.  Could be one of those bands.  They're a great one.  You don't like Steely Dan?  I like some Steely Dan.  The only song I like by them is, uh, is, uh, What's that song?  No static at all.  Oh, FM.  That's a cool song.  FM, yeah.  Yeah.  They sang about FM.  What?  I know.  Oh, gee.  I'm a fucking retard. 
[02:01:30]  I didn't realize until this fucking minute that they're literally saying there's no static  on FM radio.  No static on FM radio?  Oh, fuck that song.  I changed my mind.  Hey, thank you.  It's a bit simple, isn't it?  I changed my mind.  What, did you think it was like a figurative static?  No, literally static.  They might have ran out of ideas for a while.  I got...  What's the song about, uh, the crystal clear audio quality of FM?  The first time I ever heard that song was this rap group called Third Bass sampled it,  and they did a song called No Static at All, because static in rap means like beef, right? 
[02:02:00]  And it was such a fucking great sample, and it was a really cool song, and I really  liked it.  And then when I heard the Steely Dan thing, I was like, these guys sampled Steely Dan?  That's fucking amazing.  You know, I thought that was so cool, because everybody was, at that time, was sampling,  and it was all like R&B and funk sampled.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought it was cool that somebody sampled a classic rock group.  Steely Dan.  What is this?  This is the song where they sample No Static at All.  They just do it in the hook.  It's a cool song.  Turn it up. 
[02:02:30]  Turn it up.  I don't know if I've ever heard this.  Their bass was cool.  They were white rappers, but they didn't, like, use the white part as a gimmick.  They were just like a rap group.  This almost sounds like there's a part of, I'm your man.  Yes, I am.  And I can't help but love you.  They might have symboled that.  It sounds like that's in there, too, a little bit.  It's coming up in a second.  After this guy raps, it'll do the thing.  This is good. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, I like this song.  This is a great album.  Turn it up.  Here it comes right here.  Well, no, it's not.  There's somewhere in this.  Oh, my God.  Stop now. 
[02:03:30]  Sorry.  Somewhere in the song they play.  It's really cool.  All right.  We'll take your word for it, because I don't think I've ever heard that song.  When we get back quickly, Roland has started up some shit with Governor Christie.  I learned from you.  Oh, yeah.  And it made it to Letterman.  It started out as a picture at a Springsteen show, and it's got legs.  Well.  We'll explain next.  But, oh, Joe, are you promoting anything?  Big move to Pennsylvania. 
[02:04:00]  I'm looking for a U-Haul company.  Give me a good rate.  I do have some shows coming up, and I know the first weekend of May I'll be in Jersey doing  some stuff.  I can't remember where or when right now.  But get my album.  So, you know, go buy my CDs on iTunes, please.  Hear good things about your album.  Thank you.  They're both on there, and the fans have been very supportive.  So, if you guys could check it out.  And if you buy it, write a review.  Obviously, Joe DeRose is broke, and he has to move back in with his parents.  So, go buy his two albums, please. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  I concocted this whole family tragedy story.  Wow.  To save face that you fucking ran out of money.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  There you go.  So, is this this great?  The white man has the power.  Yeah, it's so obviously it's wise. 
[02:05:00]  I think Jay Oakerson pointed that out to me.  I believe that's who pointed that out.  He was like, it sounds like he's saying the white man has the power.  The white man has the power.  Probably what he wanted to say.  Wow, they really were sending some message back then.  Jonah Rose in studio.  Ricky Gervais in about, uh, fuck, half hour or so, man.  Ricky never blew us off.  It's awesome.  This guy's huge.  Oh, yeah.  He still does our fucking radio show.  What is he, nuts? 
[02:05:30]  He only does, like, five interviews when he's in town.  All right.  Why us?  No, he does.  Like, it's a day show.  Good morning, America.  I love you.  Oh, Roland.  You guys are there.  Yeah.  It's in his blog.  It's because of him.  It's because of Roland.  Are you friends with him?  Yeah, I know him since for a while.  I know him since for a while.  I've been hearing him all over radio all week.  Yeah, what are you talking about?  I've been doing radio.  He's just fucking around here, Roland.  Too easy, Roland.  Jesus, come on.  I'm joking.  So, Roland, really fast, went to a Springsteen show.  Bruce.  Goes to all of them. 
[02:06:00]  And at one of the shows recently, Governor Christie was close to you, huh?  Yeah.  My friend took the picture, and then he said, he showed me what he got, and then he didn't  want to tweet it.  So I sent forward it to me.  I tweeted it.  So Roland tweeted a picture of Governor Christie asleep at a Bruce Springsteen show.  That's that fuck.  Was he really sleeping, or was it one of those moments where maybe he closed his eyes and  you sabotaged the fuck?  No, when Bruce was doing this speech about poverty and everything, and his eyes were like  shut.  But then one guy yells, wake up, you fat fuck, Christie. 
[02:06:30]  Wow.  And he jumped up, and all the security looked around.  And my friend, when he got the picture, people were looking, who took it?  Really?  And they wanted it.  So my buddy got scared.  I go, I learned from you guys.  Tweet this shit out of him.  Immediately.  Right now.  In Christie's defense, the concert had entered its fifth hour.  Yes.  Fucking Bruce.  And Bruce talking about some bullshit that he doesn't even believe in anymore.  You know, I remember when industry in Jersey kind of was big, and it was a good, oh, shut 
[02:07:00]  up, with the economic summit up there on stage.  It was during the Rocky Ground song.  Oh, God.  There's people starving out there right now.  People starving out there right now.  Recession.  We got to keep Obama in office.  He said, we're going to do the session and kick ass.  Returned Jersey to be in the great state it once was.  When was that?  1780.  When they first discovered New Jersey, it was just fields. 
[02:07:30]  It was gorgeous here.  You know, rhymes with the boardwalk at Asbury Park.  You know, where the bums shoot up heroin.  People are raped.  Bruce, come on.  So the picture of Christie asleep is, it's got legs, man.  It's making blogs.  And then it made Letterman yesterday.  You got the actual picture that we could check out? 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  Did you see the picture?  Oh, yeah.  He's asleep.  Oh, I saw that.  Are we putting that picture up on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony?  Sure.  Let's do that, E-Rock.  There he is.  He's asleep.  How close were you?  Well, I used to hear my buddy was really close.  Like, you could turn around and go.  Oh, he was right there.  Okay.  Yeah.  So Letterman, I made Letterman last night.  And I'm telling you, this all started with Roland.  Well, you know, you do have the Letterman writers. 
[02:08:30]  And they do follow a lot of people on this show.  The Stengel brothers do follow a lot of people on this show, including, I think, Roland and Sam.  Yeah, we like the Stengels.  So you get that picture and it's like, ah, well, let's go to Red Bull Summit.  Did they credit you with it on Letterman?  No.  It's fine.  And they didn't show the picture.  They didn't show the picture either.  Why?  They're too scared?  Oh, oh, okay.  He could have just been rocking there with his eyes shut.  Like, yeah.  Yeah, man.  Listening to Bruce.  Listening to the music.  Just sitting there.  Feeling it.  Dreaming about cheese hot dogs. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  Loving it.  He was dancing, like, during the other songs like this.  Oh, was he?  Yeah, it made me sick, though.  I'm like, shut up.  It made me sick.  It made me upset because Bruce hates him, so I have to hate him, too.  Oh, he's a Republican.  The Stengels were not even aware of the origin of the picture.  Oh.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, how did you know that?  Did you just communicate for them?  I spoke to some folks yesterday.  High-powered people?  Some high-powered people.  People in high places?  That's right.  Yesterday.  And they didn't even know there was a connection. 
[02:09:30]  Fat fucks dance like they're hula-hooping.  That's all they can do.  No, but it looks like they're, like, they're hula-hooping.  I think because you can't fit in the seats because they remodel the garden into smaller seats.  Yeah.  Here's Letterman on the whole thing that Roland started.  Come after Roland, not us on this one.  You know, the governor of New Jersey, Chris Christie, he went to a Bruce Springsteen concert,  and he's a huge, Governor Christie's a huge, well, he's huge, period.  But he's a huge Bruce Springsteen fan. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  And he fell asleep during the show.  And I thought, oh, well, you folks can relate to that.  But the concert was actually held in the governor's pants.  Were you aware of that, ladies and gentlemen?  That's the ah-shot.  Maybe I buried the lead on that one because I guess the big news is the concert was held in his pants. 
[02:10:30]  Fuck it, Letterman.  Still doing it.  65.  Just turned.  Still has the delivery, man.  That's amazing.  He sure does, Joe.  He sure does.  Love it.  Yeah, he's funny.  Look, you're dropping shit over there.  What?  You're dropping shit all over the place over there.  What happened?  We're in agreement about Letterman.  That's what happened.  Yeah, I think so.  All right, Roland, beat it. 
[02:11:00]  Bye-bye.  There goes Roland.  Thank you so much.  Yesterday Roland cut his underwear off with a pair of scissors in the office.  Why'd you do that?  Sam just fucking, why are you calling, why are you waving Sam off?  That sounds weird.  No, it's not me.  What happened?  He just dared me.  Dared you?  Why would you dare him?  Well, what happened was Roland.  Kind of gay.  Not as gay as showering with a guy, right, Joe?  Oh, boy.  Hey, I'll do that. 
[02:11:30]  You did that.  I know.  I listen to podcasts.  I was going to say, did we talk about that?  Yeah.  I said that.  I said that.  Yeah, Bob, I used to, yeah.  Yeah.  Showered with guys.  He had a hard time getting that out.  I'm trying to think of how to say it, but there's no easy way to say it.  Yeah, it's showered with guys.  But first, Sam, why the cutting of the underwear?  Well, yesterday, Roland was sitting, and he was wearing his Hanes white briefs, tighty-whities,  as he always does.  They were not the last leg of their life. 
[02:12:00]  Well, they definitely were, because they ripped while he was wearing them.  How old were they?  A week old?  Wow.  Tough time.  So not nice.  I know.  But very funny.  Will you make a theme song for Roland?  When he comes in and go, Roland, Roland, Roland.  I think we kind of did it already.  I think we made the one with Limp Bizkit.  Yeah, yeah.  Roland, Roland, Roland, Roland.  Keep rolling.  He's the one that you call.  With happy movie reviews, wears his shirts extra small. 
[02:12:30]  The one you can count on the book, I guess, for a session.  But ends every single sentence, he says in a question.  No pronunciation, soft-spoken, and mumbles.  Just try and put him behind the mic, and he crumbles.  Babbling moron, that's for you to decide.  Bonadeus, Bonadeus, check him out Friday-wide.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  That's funny.  Yeah.  It's rolling, rolling, rolling, rolling.  That's really funny.  My idea was dumb.  See?  Da.  Da.  It wasn't a good job.  Why the cutting the underwear? 
[02:13:00]  Thank you, sir.  Did you explain it and I wasn't listening?  No, I didn't.  Oh, good.  He ripped his underwear.  Yeah.  And it was hanging on by just the elastic waistband.  Yeah.  And I told him if he lifts his arms up again, I'm going to cut his underwear.  And he said, I'll cut it myself.  And I handed him the scissors.  I said, no, you won't.  And he sat down in a chair and with four cuts while he was wearing his pants still, he cut  his underwear off and removed it.  Jesus.  That was a long week.  You had a good week.  I know.  A-listers on this show.  Yeah.  I know, but still. 
[02:13:30]  People praising the Jeff Goldblum.  Why did it take four cuts?  Well, he cut Tuesday first.  I'm all of a sudden, I'm just thinking, I'm doing the math here.  Here's snip, snip.  You think?  I'm not a mathematician.  Pull out.  Well, he stayed sitting down, right?  So he cut the side that he ripped.  So he cut his leg hole.  Uh-huh.  And then he cut the other leg hole.  That right there, you're open.  You think?  Should be it.  He pulled up the front, but it wasn't really coming up.  So he literally just cut part of the front off.  And then pulled the back out?  No.  Then he pulled the back, and he had to just cut part of the back out. 
[02:14:00]  And he left part in his pants?  Then he stood up and stuck his hand down the back of his pants and reached out the part  that was still in his undercarriage.  Please tell me you saved the underwear.  No.  And a listener would have loved that.  Oh, that would have been eBay material.  Oh, of course.  Yes.  I think giving it away in Cleveland.  Yeah, in Cleveland, right?  Jeez.  I'm going to be in Cleveland.  And he walked around with pride going commando for the rest of the day.  Nice.  Shaking his legs as he walked.  That's good.  Sam, I've got a good idea for Cleveland.  We're going to be there two weeks from today at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Afternoon drive, right?  We're doing 4 to 7, I think?  4 to 7.  It's going to be fun.  I have an idea.  Jim Norton admitted on this show that he could tell when a girl is on her period by how she  smells.  Can we do this in Cleveland?  Oh, my God!  And not talking about vaginal smell.  He's talking about just when she's sweating or just there.  Armpits.  Yeah, he can smell and go, yep, that girl's on her period.  We don't even have to ask Jim.  Jim's amazing.  I know he'll be up for this.  So we get, what, like, we get, like, I don't know, 10 girls and we mix them up. 
[02:15:00]  Some have their periods.  The others don't.  And then Jimmy tells the audience who's on their period by their smell.  Let's get 10 girls.  True.  It's crazy.  It's an ONA appearance.  I didn't think that.  It's going to be guys.  More girls lately.  Sausage fest.  More girls lately, Joe.  You got a lot of girls listening, it seems like.  I look at the Twitter things.  Well, we do.  The Twitter things.  I see a lot of broads over there.  So we want to try to get female fans or do you want to try to acquire?  We need bits, right?  Yeah, we do.  No, you don't have to acquire, like, ahead of time, like, during your pre-game show there. 
[02:15:30]  You're going to be on, too, from three to four for the audience, getting everyone pumped.  Yeah, get some girls.  Make sure, girls.  You mix them up.  If you have your period, you have to come, because it would be embarrassing if we show  up.  Yeah, we need girls on their periods.  And there's nobody on their period.  Hey, you bleeding bitches.  Right.  Show up at the fucking...  The odds are a few of their twats will be bleeding when we're against them.  Joe, are you into crime scene sex?  No.  No?  It's disgusting.  No, I'm not either.  You guys are fucking faggots.  I didn't say I wouldn't do it.  I just said I'm not into it. 
[02:16:00]  I had a girl say to me once, she goes, what's the...  I go, it was a girl I met on the road, and we were going to bang.  She goes, yeah, she goes, I go, do you have your period?  She's like, no.  And I'm like, okay.  And she's like, well, if I did, what would be the big deal?  I'm like, because I don't want your fucking blood on me, because I don't know you, you  psycho.  Yeah.  Wow.  No offense if you're listening.  Can I...  I haven't had that argument with a lot of people.  Oh, jeez. 
[02:16:30]  Can I request that my...  I'm jumping right in.  My wife turns on the radio for a minute, so my young son doesn't hear what I'm about  to say.  Oh, oh, oh.  That's more of a joke.  She's cool.  When I was in Geneseo, I dry...  When you were where?  Geneseo.  What the hell is Geneseo?  I like to brag that I was in college.  Oh.  What's Geneseo?  It's a SUNY school in western New York.  I thought it was some Italian bitch he was fucking...  I was in Geneseo, and she was bleeding.  I was working at the Inbetween, and before my shift, I was making time with a girl in my 
[02:17:00]  car, and I was dry-humping her, and then I went into her pants, and I thought I was  just doing really well, because it was nice and moist.  Oh, boy.  And I...  What a pig!  Oh, until you pull your hand up.  And I finger-popped her.  Oh, the finger-popped her.  And it was dark, and I dry-humped some more, because she wasn't going for much else, but  I did get the finger-popper.  And then I went into the Inbetween, and they had the lights for the dancing and stuff.  Uh-huh. 
[02:17:30]  And I had faded jeans on with a massive blood spot on the front of my pants, but I didn't  know until I walked in and everyone started laughing.  The fluorescent lights made it glow?  The fluorescent lights made my fucking...  Just a fucking pig.  Jill DeRose is so angry.  Her, right?  Her, not me.  No, her.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's disgusting.  I thought I was doing well, and she did not tell me.  I guess I should have...  Yeah, well...  I guess I should have known in a way, but I don't remember the circumstances totally.  You were Jim Norton, you would have smelt it. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  But she didn't tell me, and I thought I was just doing really well.  I've been there.  And then everyone's...  I'm fucking the girl, and I'm going, this is fucking...  And then there's blood.  You're like, what the fuck?  How did you not know this was about to happen?  You fucking pig.  I love that, man.  Danny had the best line ever.  He was saying, fucking a girl on a pier, you pull your dick out, it looks like the top  of a Maker's Mark bottle.  Jesus.  That's disgusting.  I've seen it's funny as fuck.  It's great.  It's disgusting.  But it's one of the most embarrassing moments for me, because we're all close to bartenders 
[02:18:30]  and everybody else, and I walk in like a fucking, thinking I'm a rock star, and I got these  big, huge bloodstains on the front of my jeans I didn't know until the lights hit it.  That, uh, I went very similar when I was in college.  I sat next to this girl all semester.  She was fucking beautiful.  She was so out of my league.  And she had a boyfriend.  Oh, boy.  But she was really nice to me, and she would, like, kind of flirt with me.  Oh.  It was one of those things where you're like, is it me, or is this going to happen?  And she broke up with her boyfriend. 
[02:19:00]  I made the move.  She went for it.  Nice!  After class one day, we go back to my apartment.  We go right into my bedroom.  This is sounding amazing.  Yeah, we're fooling around.  I'm like, holy shit, I can't believe I did this.  She's on top of me.  We're grinding.  I'm wearing khakis.  Oh, no.  We're grinding, right?  And she's like, shit, I gotta go.  I gotta get to class, whatever it is.  We walk out of the apartment.  All my buddies that lived in, it was like outdoor balcony.  They're all hanging out outside.  And I'm like, hey, guys, this is... 
[02:19:30]  Oh, no.  My friend, Pat...  Is it bad to say somebody's full name?  I just say his first name.  All right, my friend, Pat, if you're listening, buddy, because I think he listens.  Oh, shit.  He knows.  You know what I'm talking about.  Or you know who you are.  My friend, Pat, he leans in and he goes, you got something on your pants, dude.  And I was like, what?  And I looked down and I got all these spots on the front of my pants.  And I go, what the fuck is that? 
[02:20:00]  And I was trying to figure it out.  And he goes, that looks like blood, dude.  Oh, man.  And I was like, this fucking chick got her fucking, her re-re all over my fucking khakis.  There you go.  You fucking...  Very similar.  Wow.  You know what?  It's so gross.  I don't fucking mind it at all.  I don't care if it fucking...  It's all over the sheets, all over my fucking lap.  I like when it goes all over my thighs, everything.  I don't even give a shit. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my God.  Don't even care.  Bleed away.  Bleed away, young ladies.  Oh, my God.  Does it fulfill some sort of, like, virgin fantasy or something?  No, it's not.  You just don't give a shit.  It doesn't have anything to do with that.  It's just, I don't care.  I don't look forward to it.  I'm like, I'd rather it not be.  But it's not going to ruin your night.  But it would not ruin my night.  I wouldn't miss a beat.  I don't care.  I understand that.  It's fine by me.  To a point.  It just makes...  I just...  My head just goes right to AIDS. 
[02:21:00]  I see blood and I just start thinking about AIDS.  It freaks me out.  Who are you with?  You've met some of them.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm just joking.  Why did you shower with a guy, by the way?  Oh.  Oh, when I was in college, me and my buddy used to do it as a goof.  Like, if we were, you know, like, we had to get ready because the party was starting or whatever the fuck it was.  We'd be like, let's just fucking shower together.  Let's get this done quick.  And we'd drink in the shower and everybody would laugh and go, why are you guys showering together? 
[02:21:30]  And I just, I don't know.  It doesn't bother me.  Like, shit like that doesn't...  I'm very comfortable with my sexuality.  I will get naked in front of guys.  Like, I'll grab a guy's dick.  I don't care.  Like, I just don't give a shit.  I'm very confident with my sexuality.  It's gay, but...  I'm positive I'm gay.  Yeah.  I love how Joe tells a story like it's completely normal and everyone should be doing what I do.  I'll grab a dick.  I'm all man.  It's normal.  I'll pop it in my mouth.  I'll take one in the ass.  I'm all man.  Like, I went to college on an all-guy's floor. 
[02:22:00]  We all goofed around all the time.  Oh, boy.  But it never entailed...  At no point would I have ever showered with a guy.  It never entailed showering with another gentleman.  It's a goof, right?  It's a goof.  It's a goof, right?  Yeah.  I just don't care.  It just...  I can't explain it.  If you were peeing...  Well, others could explain it, Joe.  If you were peeing next to me, you were peeing...  I did this once with my buddy, Mark.  He was peeing next to me.  Yeah.  And we were drunk.  And he goes, look at my nuts, dude.  And I just reached over and went like that to one of his balls. 
[02:22:30]  You just squeezed it?  You just squeezed it?  And we were laughing so fucking hard.  And it was just hilarious.  It's called flirting.  It's like, I don't care.  Flirting.  It's called flirting.  That's how guys flirt with each other.  Yeah.  You can just grab a ball and give it a little squeeze.  Yeah.  I sniffed Bobby's nuts in here two weeks ago.  I do remember that.  But then there's also the tranny thing.  All things considered.  It's getting weird.  Oh, oh, Bailey J.  It's not...  Here's the thing.  Look, I'm not...  Obviously, I'm not embarrassed of anything in any way.  Of course.  But it's not a...  I just need to say this just to define it. 
[02:23:00]  It's not a tranny thing.  I have a thing for one transsexual.  Bailey J.  Bailey.  I think she's smoking.  But I don't have a tranny thing.  Like, I don't see transsexuals that go, ooh.  There is...  The cock thing.  Now, the cock thing...  Yeah.  But there is something about Bailey J that's attractive.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  But it's like...  But then you're like...  But why do you keep saying she?  She's got a dick.  She's...  Because she's...  I look at her as a girl.  I'm just so confused by the whole thing.  Huh?  Confused. 
[02:23:30]  It's...  You think I'm that confused by it?  She, because you said she.  I'm the one working this out.  She, because you said she.  She has a penis.  But the ultimate...  That ultimate question that comes up.  Would you rather bed down with Bailey J or that fucking...  What's his name?  Her name.  Buck Angel.  Or Buck Angel.  Now, Buck Angel is a woman.  Buck Angel has a vagina.  But Buck Angel took hormones to make a man's body and face and everything.  Who would you rather go down on?  I'm not going to chime in on this, because I don't need to get threatened by Buck Angel.  I'm going to go down on this vagina.  Yeah, you got threatened by Buck Angel. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I don't need that again.  Oh, fuck that.  After the last time we were fucking around, he tweeted me, and he goes, he goes, you sound  like a...  You sound like an asshole when you...  I heard you on the radio.  You sound like an asshole.  I'm watching you.  Look, fuck that shit.  You fucking girl.  Shut up, woman.  Who the fuck needs that?  I could give a shit.  Woman.  You got a cunt.  Shut up, woman.  Woman.  Oh, my God.  But now, yeah. 
[02:24:30]  What are you going to do?  Beg down with that.  Buck Angel.  Tattoos.  Man chest.  But has a vagina.  Who do you perform oral sex on?  Oh, God.  You have to...  With the lights on.  With the lights on.  It's not fuck in the ass, like fuck Bailey in the ass, or fuck Buck in the vagina.  I would blow Bailey over fucking that guy in the vagina.  Whoa.  I swear to God.  Wow.  I swear to God.  Look, I'm not saying you're entirely wrong there.  I'm just saying it's the Kobayashi Maru. 
[02:25:00]  It's the fucking no-win scenario that Kirk had to take.  You can't win.  You can't pick Buck Angel, though.  What?  I'll be picked Buck Angel.  I couldn't do it.  So, Ant, what's the tiebreaker?  Because it's like fucking a man.  I said you have to go down on the vagina.  He's the one with the vagina.  All right.  Then you close your eyes and go, it's a vagina.  But it's a man...  If you blew a hot chick with a dick, it would be like, all right, a hot girl's wearing a  strap-on.  Like, you could kind of get into that...  No, not really.  Beside the pulsing life going through it. 
[02:25:30]  And the fucking...  You could pretend it was a strip club that's going to come out of it.  Right, yeah.  Wow.  That's rough.  And all the pre-jizz up until that point.  Aside from any of that stuff.  But I've seen Bailey, like, with the jack-off videos and stuff, and Bailey makes the girly  noises and everything.  It's not like...  Like, if you go down on Buck, you're going to be hearing, oh, oh, yeah, that's good.  That's good.  Like, it just...  There's no...  There's no good answer here, is what it is. 
[02:26:00]  You reach up to grab a tit, and it's just pectoral.  It's just fucking hair and pecs.  No, he didn't say you had to reach up for anything.  No, you gotta fucking work.  He said, what do you go down on?  You gotta work it.  You go down on the vagina.  You gotta sell it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Put your hand...  Put your palm on their stomach.  He looks happy.  He's got like a...  He is a happy-looking guy, man.  As far as oral goes, as far as...  Oral on me, I think I would go with Bailey.  I'm saying Bailey.  Okay.  Yeah, me too.  Because I don't want the man face on me.  Bailey's got a girly face.  That's it.  Now, as far as oral on either one of them... 
[02:26:30]  You have to.  I...  I...  Wait, oral on either one of who?  Like, who would you perform oral on?  The vagina or the penis?  Now, you've already said the penis.  I thought that's what you were just saying.  No, I was saying, as far as them giving me a blowjob, I would go with Bailey, even though...  Of course.  That's a no-brainer.  It's not a no-brainer.  You don't want to feel a goatee on your balls, Ant?  Look.  Of course you'd go with Bailey.  It's not a no-brainer.  There are a lot of guys that would not get a blowjob from what amounts to a person with a penis. 
[02:27:00]  I get that, but what I'm saying is if you had to pick between two people, whether you're for it or against it, obviously you're going to pick the girl.  Not obviously.  Technically, it is a girl.  That Buck Angel is a woman.  But it wouldn't...  Nothing in your head...  Whoa.  Nothing in your head would let you say she's a woman, is my point.  Right.  It's a guy, dude.  It's a guy.  She's a guy.  It's the weirdest fuck guy with a vagina.  If she came up to me and was like, if I ran into her and she was like, motherfucker, you know, remember me? 
[02:27:30]  I'd be fucking intense.  I'd be scared.  It's a fucking dude.  Can't even kick him in the nuts either.  That's all pussy down there.  So you've got to pick which one you perform oral sex on.  I don't want to give a blowjob.  Or you go vagina.  You go vagina.  You go vagina.  You go vagina.  That's the...  As a heterosexual guy, that's the safe answer.  I know that.  But it's very conflicting.  And you put your hands behind your back.  No, he's got to...  So you don't touch pecs by accident. 
[02:28:00]  He's got to get off.  As you're licking the vagina.  He's got to get off.  Who?  Whoever you're performing on it, you have to do it to completion.  Oh, man.  And dare I say it.  All right.  Dare I say it.  And I might be really wrong.  Oh, boy.  But, I mean, it's...  Think before you speak, please.  I would only assume that after you've gone through this transition, the vagina is not going  to taste like a regular vagina.  Oh, you're thinking it's kind of a manly thing?  You're so afraid of Buck Angel, you're scared to say anything.  It's probably like...  You're afraid of a girl. 
[02:28:30]  It's probably like licking an apricot at that point.  Ah!  A dried apricot?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just cut in half.  When he...  When he...  I...  I...  I have a bit about this, so I'm not...  I'm just quoting it, but I don't want to...  I'm not trying to slip material in.  But this is true.  We like when you slip material in.  It's fine.  If it works, it works.  It gives a fuck.  Hey!  Go ahead.  When I got that tweet from him, I got all freaked out, and I called...  But Bailey J knows him, so I called her, and I was like, Buck Angel, he threatened me last 
[02:29:00]  night on Twitter, and I was just...  I just was like freaked out by it, and I told Jay Moore the whole story, and he started laughing  really hard, and I go, what the fuck is so funny?  And he goes, he goes, dude, you were so freaked out about getting beat up by the man with the  pussy that you called the chick as a cock.  Yeah, that's really fucked up.  Listen.  Fucking hilarious.  And as he said, though.  I want to go back to something you said, Ant, because... 
[02:29:30]  What about fucking them in the ass?  Big Doug Brown on the Twitter.  Yeah.  And this is a good point.  I wish we thought of this when we were talking about it.  Ant could screw a girl with her throat cut, meaning a lot of blood all over the fucking  place.  Girl on her period.  Well, that's how he put it.  Oh, okay.  But don't let her have a booger hanging.  Boogers are gross.  Well, that's true.  Boogers are gross.  You're freaked out by boogers, but if a girl's just bleeding a lot while you're having sex  with her, you're fine with that.  Well, I don't want her gushing like fucking, you know, beheading. 
[02:30:00]  But you said you don't care if the blood's down your thighs and all that.  Well, I don't.  It's smeared.  It's not a puddle.  The blood doesn't puddle.  It just smears all over the place.  But I understand this guy's logic.  That's all.  But a booger won't freak you the fuck out.  I'm more grossed out by boogers and snot than I am blood.  But see, what's that, Bailey?  Oh, man.  That's not even a good picture, Bailey, right there.  Well, I still, that's what you would have to suck.  Oh, God.  Okay, you got the cock pick.  So then what?  You reach up and grab the boobs, and then what happens?  Suck that dick.  I'd get all in there. 
[02:30:30]  I'd lick the balls.  It's not gay because you're squeezing the boobs.  Maybe it's a little gay.  You know how fucked up.  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Joe, I got to be honest with you.  Do you know how fucked up you'd be after you did that, and Bailey comes in your fucking mouth?  And you would be like, oh, God, maybe, I don't know if that was cool.  I didn't say I wanted her to come in my mouth and swallow.  And you got to swallow.  And Bailey has to.  And you got to swallow.  Why, you would just give Bailey a blowjob and be like, I hope you liked it.  You're a guy.  You know what that's like. 
[02:31:00]  Bailey's got to come.  I've never had a problem with a girl that doesn't swallow.  No, not swallow, I know.  Or in the mouth.  I've never had a problem with that.  But Bailey's got to come.  So where would you let Bailey come?  Your face?  On my tits?  On your tits.  Oh, my God.  This is just some fucking abstract.  I have no idea who's man, who's woman.  Oh, you know what?  We should play the video of the cop getting caught jerking off in his car.  Hey.  It's a big one today.  It is a tie-in.  It was on his dash cam?  I think so.  I'll be completely honest. 
[02:31:30]  I heard about this.  I have not seen it yet.  But everyone's tweeting about it and talking about it.  And also, we've got to take a quick break before Ricky Gervais.  Not to interrupt the flow, but we've got to do our shoot.  Is this the video?  Trying to find the right one.  Oh, boy.  He's trying to find the right one.  Remember, it's Sam.  This is going to be a big problem.  Yeah, everything's been fine so far today.  Well, you've got to put cop caught jerking off.  Right?  Yeah, or else then it's just like, yeah, this cop was a real jerk off. 
[02:32:00]  Trying to get me a fucking ticket.  Well, we've got the audio.  Where did they grab the audio from?  Someone else know?  I don't know.  No, caught.  Sam, put caught in.  Sam.  Cop caught.  Yeah.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, boy.  Cop caught.  Cop caught.  Oh.  You are the worst.  Cop, there it is.  I got it.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is.  This isn't the video.  While on the job.  Is it?  Where's the video?  Yeah, where's the video? 
[02:32:30]  Where's the video?  Ah!  It sucks, Sam.  Holy shit.  Sam.  I got the audio over here.  Great.  He was hired to protect and serve the citizens of Santa Fe.  But he was serving his penis.  Santa Fe.  Santa Fe news.  It's a whole news story.  You got it.  Here we go.  It has surfaced against a former Santa Fe.  They're not going to show him jerking off,  expected of masturbating in a squad car.  Tonight, we got our hands on yet another police report 
[02:33:00]  accusing former Sergeant Mike Iskand of harassing a woman.  Her gottie Schwartz has been working to figure out  how much the police department knew about Iskand's behavior  and why the department did not take action sooner.  Four on your side.  This latest victim is 18 years old,  and she told...  This isn't the same thing, is it?  What is this?  Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Sam.  What is this?  What is this?  Although, pretty hot story,  and we want the one where he's masturbating.  God damn.  Come on, Sam.  Sam. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  Oh, God.  I didn't program.  The Geico Piggy commercial.  Kind of like the Geico Piggy.  Yeah.  The first one was good.  It freaks me out.  Where it was wee wee all the way home,  but it is freaky.  I don't like it.  It reminds me of Animal Farm.  Anytime I see a talking pig,  so it always freaks me out.  Animal Farm was a good book.  Yeah.  Great book.  Good book.  I didn't mind the movie, either.  I did.  Supposed to be supervising other officers in the field,  but our four on your side team  has obtained some video 
[02:34:00]  that shows a Santa Fe police sergeant  sitting in his vehicle  having a very graphic sexual conversation  with himself.  We've got a short that's reviewed  almost a dozen hours of the video  that's here now with  We saw and heard.  Jesus Christ.  More on your side.  The desire to protect and serve  the citizens of Santa Fe,  but now several women  want police to protect them  from Sergeant Mike Iskant.  Same thing.  It's the middle of the day  on January 24th, 2011,  and Sergeant Mike Iskant 
[02:34:30]  has forgotten his dash cam video  is rolling.  On the video,  we worked for more than a month  to get.  First you hear moans,  then the unmistakable sound  of a zipper.  Iskant is alone in his squad.  Based on what we heard,  it sounds like he's looking at a picture  of a naked woman on his cell phone  or texting someone  and talking to himself.  Here is a sample  of what he is saying.  Oh, you have big,  beautiful breastfed.  Oh, my God. 
[02:35:00]  Eventually, the sergeant breaks away  to respond to a call.  This week, we showed  the chief the video.  He told us he hadn't seen it before.  Do you see anything wrong  with what's in this video?  No.  Well, yeah, again,  I'm not in a position  to comment at this point  until the investigation is concluded.  And if that's the case,  obviously, I have no authority  to discipline Sergeant Iskant  at this point.  He's no longer here.  Even though the chief 
[02:35:30]  and internal affairs  knew about the tape  and knew Iskant  was being investigated  for several crimes,  he was never put on leave  and never suspended.  This week, he was found guilty  of harassing women,  stalking women,  stealing marijuana,  and using a criminal database  to run people's information.  But despite that,  Iskant is being allowed  to collect accumulated leave  until he officially  retires in November.  Right.  Paid for him by taxpayers.  On Monday,  we're going to dig deeper  into this story 
[02:36:00]  and ask questions like,  why was Mike Iskant  given the number 69  as his official badge number  and patrol car number?  How much did the chief  really know  about Mike Iskant's  behavior for six?  Why, with so many  of these red flags  that we dug up,  was Mike Iskant  allowed to continue  working as a cop?  Are you kidding me?  That's coming up  Monday night at 10.  That's correct.  Why 69?  Get it?  I would say  because it was a coincidence.  Yeah, that doesn't seem  like something  they would do on purpose.  I love that they said 
[02:36:30]  that they talked  about internal affairs.  Like, that's...  You're in internal affairs  and this is the fucking  case you get?  That's it.  You think you're going to  blow the roof off  of some city hall thing?  Some big corruption thing?  Yeah.  Fucking Serpico shit?  You gotta fucking  get the jerk off cop?  Yeah, you're busting  the J-O cop.  That sucks.  Too good.  All right, we're going  to break because I think  Ricky Gervais is going  to be here very, very soon.  Have you ever met  Ricky Gervais, Joe?  No, I'm excited to, man. 
[02:37:00]  He's a good guy.  Big fan of his work.  I don't even know  what he's promoting  because he has so much.  He's got...  There's so much going on.  I don't even know  which project he's...  He's working on, yeah.  Which one?  Season three  of the Ricky Gervais show.  On HBO?  Yeah, that starts next week.  Okay.  Because this Sunday  is the season finale  of Life's Too Short.  And then he's got  the thing with Carl  doing the bucket list thing.  Right.  Holy fuck.  He's got three hit shows.  Yeah.  All right. 
[02:37:30]  Ricky Gervais next.  Serious XM.  You're listening  to Opie and Anthony.  Perfect timing.  It's certainly CNN now.  Yeah.  What, you've got to get  your facts right.  Oh, yeah.  We do.  Certainly, yeah.  We got them all represented.  We got MSNBC, CNN, Fox.  Yes, we're not biased here. 
[02:38:00]  No, no.  We're fair and balanced.  We're fair and balanced  across the board.  And we lean forward  and we do all those things  that all the networks say do.  We actually goof on all of them.  Yeah, I don't see  how any of them  are very accurate.  No, no.  Especially with all the news  happening today.  You, uh, you're great  on, uh, the Twitter,  I gotta say.  I follow you on Twitter  and, uh, very good.  Very open and honest  and not a little,  not afraid of a little  controversy with the  religious zealots  out there.  Yeah, I do get into  some arguments  with, uh,  the odd fundamentalists, 
[02:38:30]  you know,  they, they, they say  the Earth's 5,000 years old.  I say it's 4.6 billion.  It's a difference of opinion.  Who knows?  Who knows?  Well, scientists do.  Carbon dating  pretty much tells us,  but yeah, you know,  you can have your own opinions,  but you can't have  your own facts.  It's very hard to argue  with anybody  because you know,  you're not changing  anyone's opinion.  There's no point.  And the other thing is  there's so many spoofs  of fundamentalists like that,  which you literally  cannot tell the difference.  There's nothing you could 
[02:39:00]  make up more ridiculous  than what these people  believe.  I mean, their,  their whole, um, aspect  is, is, I think,  clouded by episodes  of the Flintstones.  That's where they've got  a lot of their  science and nature.  We're dinosaurs  and humans.  We're together  and we use big, uh,  pelicans as garbage  disposal.  Things like that, okay?  So, uh, yeah,  and, um,  I also get things on Twitter  like, uh,  oh, you're just doing  self-promotion.  I go, yep.  Yeah.  No, I want to be  your friend.  Here's my address. 
[02:39:30]  Come round.  You fucking maniac.  Yeah, people have  gotten very,  they, they kind of  lose touch in what  this all really is  because they call it  following and friends  and things like that.  It really isn't  a friendship.  No, it's, um,  well, it's sort of  a friendship, uh,  you have with a film  star when you're  in jail for life.  It's, it's that one  when you write them  saying, right,  are we married yet?  No, we're not. 
[02:40:00]  No, we're not married yet.  No.  We, we, we had spoken  a lot of times, uh,  about, about how  in the past it used  to be very difficult  to communicate with  a celebrity that you,  you like.  You take Clark Gable,  you'd have to write  a letter, uh,  know, know the address  to send it to.  Yeah.  Write it literally  with your hand.  Send it off.  It would maybe  get to a, a publicist  if you were lucky  or the, the company  he was signed under,  the contract, MGM  or something.  You never got to  actually speak  with that person.  But that's true  of everything now.  Now you don't have  to write a letter. 
[02:40:30]  Now you can just sort of  shout it from the streets.  Yeah.  Or, or your toilet wall  gets read by millions  of people.  Yeah.  Everyone's got an opinion  and, um, and, and  things blow up  really quickly.  Yeah.  So controversy  that isn't controversy  is, you know,  now ten times  the controversy  it would have been,  you know, in an open  letter that someone  might have read or not.  And now it's, it's,  it's, it's pretty scary  really, the restrictions,  particularly in comedy,  particularly with, you  know, people like us.  You know, people don't  see it as comedy  a lot of times too. 
[02:41:00]  They, they take you  very literally  in what you're writing,  not understanding  the context  and that you're a comic  and all of a sudden,  you know, another,  another, we're in the,  the decade of the apology.  So another apology  is necessary  for something that  you never meant to be bad.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  Absolutely ridiculous.  It makes me angry  and it's got worse  over the last couple  of years  because people think  just because they're  offended, they're right.  That's, by definition,  they think, well,  I, I don't like it.  Right.  So no one else  should like it.  Some people are offended  by homosexuality.  Some people are offended  by mixed marriage. 
[02:41:30]  What are we meant to do?  Just ban them  because one person  somewhere has got,  you know,  that's their problem.  That's too logical.  It's their problem.  But that's too logical.  Ricky, you're too logical.  That makes too much sense.  Well, that's the thing  about offense as well,  though,  because it's nothing  to do with right and wrong.  It's to do with feelings  and feelings are personal.  You have the right  to be offended in America.  People forget that.  You say it all the time.  You have the right  to be offended,  but I have the right  to offend.  But they don't understand that.  You don't have the right  never to be offended.  But they think  if I'm offended,  then no one should be able  to watch that show,  listen to that radio show. 
[02:42:00]  The Educational Board  of New York,  50 words,  they suggest to be banned  from exam papers.  One of which was dinosaur.  Yeah.  Yes.  Because it might offend someone.  It might offend.  Dinosaurs existed.  They did.  They really did.  Yes.  We know that much.  You could argue  when they existed.  It's crazy that  the people that are  the truly offensive ones  are the ones  that get so angry.  It's like,  it's always funny to me  that a Christian  will yell at you  for going,  I don't believe in God.  They'll go,  you motherfucker. 
[02:42:30]  But like,  an atheist would never  do that to the Christian.  If somebody goes,  I believe in God,  I would never go,  you,  I'll fucking kick  your fucking ass  right now for saying that.  We also get accused  of being smug.  You're right.  But it's so illogical.  And also,  this thing about,  well, forget,  it's not just Christian.  I don't believe in any God.  I don't believe,  and it's nothing really  to do with  what religion you are  or spiritual belief.  It's just whether  you're an arsehole or not.  Right, right.  I've met arsehole atheists.  Right, right.  It's nothing to do with that. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  But there's not many atheists  who kill other people.  That's true.  You don't often kill  in the name of no God.  I think that's the big difference.  It's so hard to refute facts.  I mean,  in ye olde days,  it was easier  for very religious people  to say,  well,  this is what it is  because I have my faith  and beliefs.  But as we went forward  and learned  that these things  did happen  and technology 
[02:43:30]  got better  and we were able  to say,  well,  there were dinosaurs  and they were around  at this time  and the earth  was this old.  they had a harder time  trying to bamboozle everybody  into believing  that it's the way  it was in the Bible.  Well,  that's the thing.  This is the other thing.  It's such a circular argument.  You say,  why do you believe in God?  And they say,  well,  it says so in the Bible.  Yeah,  but why do you believe that?  Because it says so in the Bible.  Yeah,  but why do you believe  what it says in the Bible?  It says so in the Bible.  Oh,  okay.  Let's leave it there then.  It really is an archaic way 
[02:44:00]  of thinking.  Dinosaurs not mentioned  in the Bible?  No.  The earth doesn't say,  by the way,  it's a big sphere.  A sphere with gravity.  It's funny  because all the thoughts  in the Bible  are what they knew then.  That's weird,  isn't it?  Right.  Would you take anything  that was written back then  as fact?  We've proven them  to be wrong  on everything.  Well,  the information around now  is 50% wrong.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's so bad.  It's furious. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  man.  It's lunacy.  It's fucking...  It is.  I just watched this thing  about quantum physics  where they did it.  Braggard.  You're on the wrong  fucking radio show.  Oh,  God.  Why don't you get out of here?  Trying to impress Ricky on it,  really.  He didn't say he understood it.  He just saw flashing.  There were some flashing lights.  Pretty colors.  Yeah,  there was a round thing  and it got bigger  and it got so small  you could hardly see it.  and they reckon  it's the smallest thing ever.  What? 
[02:45:00]  Joe,  what do you know about  quantum physics?  Nothing.  Okay,  so Ricky's right,  right?  You know,  I was...  Ricky,  by the way,  you know,  I was watching something  on the quantum physics.  But to be fair,  there's a phrase  that goes around  quantum physics circles.  This is true.  It says,  if you think you understand  quantum physics,  you don't understand  quantum physics.  Oh,  wow.  So,  there you go.  There we go.  I certainly don't understand  quantum physics.  So he just saved your ass.  The only reason  it was bringing up  was that there was  a part in it  where they talked about 
[02:45:30]  when Columbus  first landed  with the ships  and how the natives  where he landed  couldn't see the ships  because they had never  seen a ship before.  And it took one of them  to go,  no,  it's there.  And then once this one guy  pointed it out,  they all saw it.  And at the beginning  of the story,  I had a reason  for telling it.  I can't remember  how it ties into  what we're talking about.  There was a show  on quantum physics  in England recently  and Carl Pilgerton  called me up after  and said,  I've got a headache. 
[02:46:00]  He said,  okay,  he said,  explain to me  that I'm going to do it.  Sure, sure.  He just watched  an hour program  and suddenly I'm going to...  Right?  And I never know  when to start with it.  I said,  he said,  what happened  before the Big Bang?  I went,  nothing.  He went,  there must have been  something.  I said,  there wasn't.  I said,  all matter that exists  was in an infinitely  small space,  smaller than the size  of an atom,  okay,  and it expanded  and created space.  He went,  what did it expand into?  I said,  nothing.  There wasn't even  space for it to expand.  He was going,  there had... 
[02:46:30]  He said,  there's always been space.  That was it.  That was his statement.  That was his statement.  I can't agree with that.  There had to be something there.  It's tough.  It's tough to wrap your head around it.  Trying to get him  to understand that  is bizarre  because his understanding  of anything in the world  in front of him  is just amazing.  It is amazing.  It's a take on something  that I've never seen.  Just explaining evolution  to him is a joy.  I've tried it many,  many times.  I love his take on animals.  His animals are great.  He,  I remember...  He was talking about the slug. 
[02:47:00]  The slug,  yeah.  He doesn't understand the slug.  Well, I said,  the slug is as evolved as us.  Yeah.  He went rubbish.  He said,  I've coughed up  more complicated creatures.  He's brilliant with what he says.  He really is brilliant.  He's great.  Does Carl do press?  Um, sorry?  We want him to be on the show.  He doesn't do press or nothing.  He's terrified of it.  I've got him to do a couple of things.  Does he realize how famous he is?  Uh,  you made him extremely famous.  No, he doesn't.  He thinks people just point and laugh  because he's got a perfectly round head.  It is.  I've explained that you're on his head now. 
[02:47:30]  I can't get enough of him.  I was explaining,  you know,  everyone uses the model of the giraffe.  A creature like a giraffe  was born with a slightly longer neck.  It could reach more leaves.  It could pass on its genetic material  for longer.  It was more successful.  Then, et cetera.  He went,  but why did they evolve a long neck  to reach the leaves?  He said,  why didn't they just learn  to build a ladder?  And I couldn't answer it.  I went, yeah, good point.  It's a good point.  It's, you know.  Yeah, but why did that animal  feel like it had to have a long neck?  Well, it's got to get the leaves 
[02:48:00]  that the other ones can't get.  The other animals just found leaves  close by to the ground.  Well, they're smaller.  Like, the giraffe is a little big,  so it's got to get...  The other animals  will eat everything.  There's no will to evolution.  Animals aren't sitting around  going, I wish I evolved.  They're either selected  or they're not.  It's a billion years  that's sorted it out for us.  You don't need to worry about it.  Maybe something went wrong, though,  because they're the only animal  with a long neck.  But there's things  where some of the fundamentalists  they send me things like,  well, if we evolved from apes, 
[02:48:30]  I go, we didn't evolve from apes,  we shared an ancestry,  rather like cousins  have the same grandparents.  If we evolved from apes,  why are there still apes around?  I go, well,  if he made us from dust,  why is there still dust around?  You know, there's no...  I mean, it's just...  It's great to watch, though.  Your take on things are great.  And when I watch on Twitter,  when you get into a little spat  with some people,  your take on it is very good.  You come off as somebody  who's very educated  on these things.  And is it from reading a lot 
[02:49:00]  or you watch a lot of TV?  Because nowadays,  you can get a hell of an education  just watching, like,  Smithsonian and Discovery.  I'd say TV,  certainly in my younger years,  was probably 50% of my education.  Really?  Yeah, I mean,  I could read early  and that's sort of  a lost art to me now.  As soon as I finished college,  I thought,  I never have to read again.  Not even that it's a pleasure  in any way, shape or form.  No, I watched...  You know, my world was TV, 
[02:49:30]  sitting behind the TV  and I watched nature programs  and science programs  and those sort of things.  And, you know,  trash TV as well,  which I still do.  Yeah, it's a good balance  and then you find  you're pretty well informed  on a lot of things.  I think TV's great  and particularly things like,  in England we have BBC,  which is government funded,  which means they can make shows  that no one watch  that are brilliant  and that's what's great about it.  You know, they've got BBC4,  which is arts and science  and everything  and I might be the only one 
[02:50:00]  watching it that night,  but do you know what I mean?  I don't want you  to take it away from me.  Right, don't take it away.  It's not all about writings.  It's not all about dumbing down.  It's not all about  seeing another pop star  we don't need.  You know?  Yes.  So I applaud things like that.  Yeah.  You're very well,  you've already stated,  very well educated,  but that's what I like  about your stand-up so much too  is that you do these bits  and you translate it  to a very common audience.  You know what I mean?  You could watch your special  and you go into all these places 
[02:50:30]  with very high concept stuff,  but it never feels like  he's talking down to me  or he's making me feel left out  that I don't know this.  Well, I think that's  you have to take big,  broad brushstrokes  with anything.  If anything,  you're dealing with  anything slightly academic.  It's no good explaining something  and then hoping  you'll get a joke out of it.  You've got to,  it's got to be quite broad  and I think it's important  that you at least know the truth  in any field of comedy.  Even if you're doing something  political or moral  or scientific, 
[02:51:00]  I think you have to know the truth  before you can start  screwing with it.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  We used to have this guy  in England called Les Dawson  who used to play the piano  and he used to put in bum notes.  But you had to know the tune  to know what,  and it was so funny.  Oh, wow,  to know if it was wrong, right?  Exactly, yeah.  So it was just,  I think it's rather like that.  So every time he plays a bad note  that he did it  was sort of quite smugly  thinking that.  Just slightly off.  It would just make you laugh  because you knew it was wrong.  And that's what comedy is,  isn't it? 
[02:51:30]  It's sort of,  you know where they've gone wrong.  You know where the comedian's  gone wrong.  Right, right.  I prefer that to comedy  where you're outwitting the world  and people are swaggering  going out saying  why they're the...  Yeah, yeah.  There's no...  They know a little more  than you do.  Yeah, exactly.  Just a little more than you.  Are you happy with  how busy you are these days?  Because I know  when we've talked to you  in the past,  you were kind of working  on a project  or you'd just come off  of a project or something.  But you're really...  You're all over the place now.  Are you happy with that? 
[02:52:00]  Do you have enough time  still for yourself?  It's all fun.  Winston Churchill said  if you find a job  you really love  you'll never work again.  And that's what it feels like.  This is fun.  I mean, you guys.  You're sitting down.  We pitch every day  but of course  in the end  it's a great gig.  But you know,  my dad was a laborer.  Yeah, I know.  My dad was a laborer  with his wife.  He worked when he was 70.  He used to go up at 5.30  and he carried bricks around.  Right.  We mustn't complain.  Exactly.  You really are not allowed.  I remember working  before radio 
[02:52:30]  I worked in construction.  Cool color jobs.  I did construction.  It sucked.  It was not fun.  Yeah.  I mean,  some of the guys  on the job were fun.  It was, you know,  things like that.  We joked around  but the bottom line was  houses had to be built.  Yeah, exactly.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Coming in here  it's like,  all right,  it's early in the morning.  Can you tell me  what houses you built  so I don't buy one?  Yeah, don't.  Believe me.  I have a nightmare.  I used to put in  air conditioning and heating  in central air  in office buildings  and homes  and I used to take 
[02:53:00]  these powder actuated  fasteners.  It's a bullet  that loads into a gun  where nails  then stick into cement  and I would put  these hangers up  for these giant  air conditioning units  that would be hanging  above hung ceilings  like this.  in offices  and I wasn't sure  if the nail  really caught well.  I'm still waiting  for one of these  to crush somebody  and for me  20 years later  to get sued  because they have  some paperwork  I signed  where I was the guy  that hung this  and someone got crushed.  I swear I still 
[02:53:30]  think about it  because I really  wasn't good.  Everyone listening now  in offices  is just looking up.  Look up right now  there's a lot of machinery  that a drunk  put in at some point.  It's unbelievable.  It's like,  dude, people get mad  like I'll get mad  when the train's late  and be like,  what the fuck?  And then when I step back  and think of all the morons  that are running  all these systems  I'm like,  it's a miracle  the fucking train  comes at all.  That it even runs.  That it comes at all  because they put people  like me and you  in jobs like that  and you're just like  whatever.  I like it as well  when a train's delayed 
[02:54:00]  and it says,  sorry,  we're delayed  a person threw themselves  and died on the train  and people still go,  oh,  just scrape it.  Very self-concerned.  I'm going to be late.  How long is this going to take?  I saw this fox pop  in England.  It was about  how they're going to have  to slow the trains down  for safety.  There's been a few  and they're going to slow them down  and of course  they ask the man on the street,  why do they ask the man  on the street now?  I don't care about  the man on the street.  Who's in charge?  And so they went out 
[02:54:30]  and they were saying,  well,  it's terrible  because it already takes me  an hour and a half  to go to work  and that's like two hours  and that's four hours.  Yeah,  it's awful,  yeah.  And one bloke said,  well,  you know,  it's better to arrive late  than dead.  Who arrives dead?  Where's this guy  that's sitting at his desk  and they're going,  Bob's in early.  I'm in early,  but I'm dead.  And they go,  oh no,  it's much better to arrive.  I'd rather you're a bit late  Bob than dead  because you're no good to me now.  Man on the street.  Don't ask the man on the street. 
[02:55:00]  They are good.  Oh my God.  We have a guy  who's very mad  because he says  atheists have killed  a ton of people.  What?  Oh,  is this the  Hitler was an atheist?  Oh God.  Okay,  Hitler was an atheist.  That's one.  Let's find out.  Okay.  Ben in Virginia.  Ben.  Oh,  I've got my headphones on.  Oh.  Good.  Ben real fast.  Yeah.  Ricky,  man,  atheists have killed  more people  than believers.  Think about the Soviet Union.  Yeah.  Stalin. 
[02:55:30]  No,  my point is  they didn't kill anyone  because they were a  religion.  That's the difference.  There are  killers who are  atheists  and killers who are not  atheists.  There are killers  of all religions  and killers of no religion.  Okay?  But the people  who are atheists  very rarely  kill someone  because there's no God.  And this is what  makes me laugh  when people think  that you can't be  a moralistic person  without God  because there's  no guidance  of good,  right?  Which was mad.  So I say,  you're telling me  that if suddenly  someone said  there is no God,  you'd suddenly start  going out and 
[02:56:00]  raping and killing  because you could.  Right.  I don't believe  in God  and I'm a good  person because  it's the way  I'd want to be  treated and it's  the society  I'd like to live  in.  And a secular  belief based  on intelligence  and logic  and consensus  is so much  better than  an old ghost  said it once.  Fair enough.  But those  atheists out  there are  oftentimes as  belittling as  the Christians  are.  Bill Moller's.  But I wonder,  I don't,  I think it was.  Oh,  I think you can 
[02:56:30]  belittle a belief  but I don't  belittle their  right to believe  it.  I believe you  have the right  to believe  anything you  want,  however illogical  or crazy,  but I have the  right to find  it ridiculous.  Right.  You can't  respect a crazy  belief.  You don't  respect a child  that believes  in Santa.  You don't  respect that  belief but you  respect that  child's right  to believe it  and hopefully  grow out of it.  The problem  with religion  is they don't  grow out of  it because  they don't  get a chance  and a child's  brain is a 
[02:57:00]  sponge.  It will take  in what a  parent tells  it to and  that's a  survival mechanism.  Don't touch  the fire,  don't walk  off the edge,  don't be bad  or you're  burning hell.  That to me  is child abuse  and I just  think it's  okay to have  religion and  spirituality but  I think it has  to be their  choice.  That's all I'm  saying.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow, Ben.  Fair enough.  Thank you, Ben.  Far enough,  far enough.  Hey, Ricky,  why do you think  you have such  a huge fan  base thinking  how you do  as far as  religion goes? 
[02:57:30]  Because that  topic, as you  can see,  pisses off a  lot of people.  By just being  honest with it?  I don't think  what I'm saying  is I don't  believe in God.  I don't believe  in any God.  Right.  You know, there  are about 2,700  deities over the  past 4,000 or  5,000 years of  civilization.  Right.  Okay?  So when a  Christian says I  don't believe in  their God,  basically I believe  in one less God  than them.  That's exactly it. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  And think of how  many people are  wrong.  Even if one  religion's right,  boy, there's a lot  of wrong people  that are praying  to the wrong God.  I think that's  why you,  exactly, yeah.  And there's this,  you know,  Catholics, for  example, they  believe you can't  go to heaven  unless you believe  in this God.  Yeah.  So Hindus are  all going to hell.  Yeah.  They can be the  nicest person in  the world.  They can be the  most peaceful,  righteous person  on the planet.  But because they  believe in the  so-called wrong God,  they're going to  burn in hell  forever.  Yeah.  This is crazy talk. 
[02:58:30]  I just love the  concept, too,  that an all-knowing  God wouldn't,  if you died and  died an atheist  and you wind up  in heaven,  that an all-knowing  God wouldn't say,  I get it, dude.  It's, this is  ridiculous.  Surely an all-knowing  God.  This is ridiculous.  Well, either God,  see, this is by  definition, the God  that, you know,  in this country  worship is all  powerful, he's all  knowing, and he's  good.  One of those  doesn't give.  Because you take 
[02:59:00]  a disaster, he  either couldn't  avoid it, so he's  not all-powerful.  Right.  He either didn't  avoid it, so he's  a bit of a dick,  or there is no  God.  Right.  One of those  three has to be  true logically.  You can't have  all of them.  Are you going to  write a book on  this someday?  No.  That would be a  great read.  I just like  mouthing off on  Twitter.  You know, the  reason Ricky's  here is we got to  make sure people  know the Ricky  Gervais show.  Season three  premieres next  Friday, April  20th.  On HBO. 
[02:59:30]  I mean, I love  the show.  It's just an  amazing thing to  have that animated  like that.  And it gives the  latitude to go into  a complete fantasy  world, but it's  still you guys.  We know you are  your characters.  It was funny just  to be in a room  with Carl, just  to hear him talk  about his world,  but now you animate  his world, and it  goes off to his  flights of fantasies.  His fantasies, his  ideas, his diaries.  When he's young,  yeah, his diaries.  He's quite amazing.  And Merchant does a  good job, obviously.  Oh, yeah, he's 
[03:00:00]  great.  There's three of us,  yeah, exactly.  The chemistry is  great.  What subjects are you  guys talking about  this season?  Well, the first  episode is a doozy.  It's when Carl has  an idea for a movie,  right?  It takes him ages  to explain it, and  he pitches this to us  like we're Hollywood  executives, right?  And then you get to  see the film.  And it's basically  Tom Cruise dies  making Mission  Impossible 7, right?  But production's  already underway.  And there's a guy  called, a bloke  called Brian, who's  played by Ted Danson,  right? 
[03:00:30]  Who decides to take  over Tom Cruise's  body.  So they put his brain  in Tom Cruise's  body.  So Tom Cruise is  finishing the movie,  but it's the brain  of Brian, this bloke.  And that's the movie.  That's the movie.  I'd watch.  I'd watch.  It is.  It's quite brilliant,  actually.  Are you going to  throw him out in the  world again, or is he  done with that?  Yeah, we're doing a  third season.  Well, it's a special.  I'm sending him  around the world with  Warwick Davis, the  dwarf.  Life's too short.  Carl's going to do 
[03:01:00]  the Marco Polo route  of cycling from  Venice to Hong  Kong with  a dwarf in a  basket.  And the first time I  pitched him this idea,  he didn't say, well,  that's ridiculous.  He went, he said, so  I'm doing all the  fucking peddling.  That was his first  thought.  You can never know what  he's going to say.  You can never know.  I told him recently, I  said, I know he's  fascinated with animals,  right?  And I said, there's a  program on it called 
[03:01:30]  The Truth About the  Giant Squid.  And Carl went, who's  been lying about it?  I told him.  Like, this squid has  been sort of aligned in  the press.  Now he's going on CNN to  go, well, it's not true.  I mean, I've never  raped a crab in my  life.  I don't know where  that came from.  I can't get into jars.  It's a fallacy.  It's fucking brilliant,  man, in a way.  It's amazing.  The logic of it.  Well, I was explaining  to him that chimps are 
[03:02:00]  98.6% genetically  identical to human  beings.  I said, think of that,  Carl, 1.4% difference.  And Carl thought  about it and went,  that's got to be the  arse.  I love the idea that  he's thought, these  chimps sitting around  going, if we can sort  this arse out, we're  human.  If we can just get  this arse sorted out.  Not literally a part  of.  Exactly, yeah.  1.4%.  Yeah.  In my house, we're 
[03:02:30]  obsessed with him.  Like, what is his  life entail when he's  not doing projects  for you?  Well, that's one of  the episodes, A Day  in the Life of Carl,  we question him.  Oh, great.  And they've done it  like it's a reality  show, where he's  being filmed, and it's  just fantastic.  Is it just a boring  life?  You'd think it is, but  it's the funniest  thing.  I mean, the things  that gets in the  diary, the things he  does, he gets up  regularly, Suzanne goes  out, and we say,  what, a little peck on  the cheek?  She goes, no, I'll  just tap her on the  back of the head.  Sometimes she tells 
[03:03:00]  me there's ham in  the fridge.  Like, it's some sort  of Pavlovian  conditioning.  I tapped her on  the head once, she  said ham in the  fridge.  He's such an odd  little creature.  Oh, my God.  What does he do?  Can you walk us  through quickly?  DIY.  As soon as his  girlfriend leaves, he  starts fixing things.  They say, oh, that  tile's locked.  So he knocked the  tiles off, and he  knows he's got until  she comes home at  5.30 to put the  tiles back.  He just likes DIY.  Wow.  He wants to work in a  DIY store.  I mean, everyone's  after him to do TV  shows, books, but  he, no, I've got to  do the kitchen. 
[03:03:30]  I've got to do the  kitchen.  Is there some OCD in  there?  I said, right, the  weekend, I came out  the weekend, Easter  weekend, right, and he  was furious.  He had to do some  emergency work because  he's selling his  house, okay?  So he needed a  carpenter, right?  And he said, I  couldn't get anyone.  No one had to come  out, right?  None of them, none  were available.  I went, well, yeah, I  said, but it's Good  Friday.  He went, well, how the  fuck did Jesus ever  get crucified?  Holy shit!  Like, the idea, they  go, have you got  a presentation?  Can you do that? 
[03:04:00]  No, it's Good  Friday.  I don't work Good  Friday.  No, you've got to  do it.  That's hilarious.  It's got to be so  just stressful to be  him.  Like, his mind is  constantly in turmoil.  When he said when he  was born, he said his  mum said he could  frown before he could  talk.  So he learned all the  frowning.  He said I was a sad  baby.  Sad baby!  I was a sad baby!  That's when it's  easy.  Oh, God, that's  fucking hilarious.  You knew you had  gold when you met him  for the first time,  right?  But it's just little 
[03:04:30]  things he says that  you can never predict.  He, um, uh, we  were saying about  the earliest memory  and I was going, um,  oh, I don't know,  four, five, Carl was  going, no, no.  I said, no, seven,  I said, no, you  can remember back to  your four or five.  He went, he said,  my parents don't even  remember me back  then.  What does that  mean?  We were talking  about doppelgangers  once, like the  exact same thing,  look at that, and he  said, I like that.  I said, why?  He said, how would I 
[03:05:00]  know which one I was?  Brilliant.  Absolute genius.  Oh, God.  No one thinks that.  We thought it was  too good to be true,  like he was a, you  know, comedian or an  actor first.  No, I totally  believe it.  Then you realize.  But at first, it was  like, this is too  good.  He's like it 24-7, and  I phone him every day  just to find out what  he's doing, you know,  just to get his  slant on life.  We're jealous, because  you know, doing what  we do, we find some,  you know, some quirky  people.  He'd be amazing.  But you found the 
[03:05:30]  king of all of them.  I think so.  I feel like, honestly,  sometimes I feel like  Anthony Hopkins in  The Elephant Man,  just taking him  around.  Yeah.  Well, that's his  favorite film.  Right, we're watching  that.  Oh, my God.  You know the bit in  The Elephant Man where  he takes his clothes off  behind the screen and  Anthony Hopkins is  presenting it to all  these physicians.  He goes, look at the  deformation of the  skull, the spine, and  ironically, the genitals  are untouched.  They are normal.  Carl went, think of  that, the one thing  you would want like an  elephant, and he gets  the head.  Just the thought. 
[03:06:00]  I was like, The Elephant  Man, he'd like, well,  if it's the Elephant  Man, give me a big  cock.  At least give me a  big cock.  At least give me the  elephant cock.  Please, at least do  that for you.  I know.  Fantastic.  Oh, people want to  know if we ever get to  meet Suzanne.  Yeah, a lot of  Idiot Abroad fans  chugging in.  Well, yeah, she does  exist.  It's not like Columbo.  But that's what we've  done on the animation  as well, just so you  never see her.  Yeah.  She's very nice and  normal, and sometimes 
[03:06:30]  when he's talking, me  and my girlfriend go to  dinner with him, and  here come up one of  these things, and you  just see her looking at  him so affectionately.  You know what I mean?  So proud of him.  Oh, that's kind of  sweet.  It really is.  It's really sweet.  Did you make a concerted  effort to get yourself in  shape?  Because you aren't a  slob or anything, but  you were a little  different person.  You were a little  heftier, let's say.  You did now.  And now, I mean, I've  seen pictures of you  from magazines and 
[03:07:00]  whatnot.  He drastically changed  his look.  He looked, that was  11.  And he's kept it  up.  Anthony going, I  mean, you weren't a  slob or anything.  I wasn't a slob.  He just said it so  long ago, but it was  hilarious.  No, I wasn't a slob.  I ate and drank too  much and didn't do  enough exercise.  That's how you get  fat.  Yeah.  It's simple science.  You get fat if you're  taking more calories  than you burn off.  I've always known  that.  I knew it when I was  fat.  I knew why I was  fat.  No one ever gets fat  behind their own  back.  No one ever starts  eating and goes,  what happened?  If you go up to a  guy and he's surrounded  by pies and you say,  Frank, you know what's  making you fat? 
[03:07:30]  He doesn't say, is it  all the jogging?  He knows.  You know why you're  doing it.  And I just upped the  exercise.  Was there a reason?  Did you have to say,  oh, this is why I'm  eating more than I  should and not  exercising?  Christmas, I was  48, I had 11  sausages and I was in  a sweat and I was  saying to Jane, I'm  going to have a  heart attack.  Oh, Jesus.  And I thought, right,  that's it.  Life's really good at  the moment.  I don't want to  just say it.  Was there a reason  you were eating a  lot, do you think? 
[03:08:00]  Was there any  deep-seated bullshit?  No, just being lazy.  Not stress or  anything like that?  No, I was really  thin and I worked  out.  I got my first job  at 28 and then for  the next 15 years,  they were my eating  years.  I just got heavier  and heavier, just  very slightly, just  eating cheese and  enjoying food and  stuff.  And then you think  enough, which I  still do, but I  don't diet or  anything.  I still eat and  drink too much.  Then I work out  like Rocky the next  day.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  To try to bounce  it out.  Exactly, yeah.  The only reason you  want to live longer 
[03:08:30]  is to eat and  drink more.  Because, like I  was saying, there  are magazine  pictures of you  where it's like,  wow, Ricky actually  is a sex symbol.  Yeah, that's right.  You've got the hair  going and sunglasses  on and stuff and  you're in shape.  It's like, could  you ever imagine  that at your age  now, you'd be,  as far as women  go, more attractive  than you were a few  years ago?  Thank God they  can't see me going  red.  Also, those magazine  articles, I should  say, that they've  superimposed the  elephant penis on me.  Did they do that? 
[03:09:00]  Well, that's good.  That's why it's big,  gray and wrinkly.  Are you going to  make more movies or  what?  Well, I mean, yeah.  I mean, I'm not not  making movies.  I'm just busy at the  moment.  I resisted it for a  while just because I  was making The Office  and extras.  I did a couple.  I did Ghost Town  and The Adventure of  Lying and then I've  just been doing Life  Too Short and now I'm  starting a new thing  called Derek but I'm  not avoiding Hollywood.  I just, I sort of like  to do my own thing so  unless it's right or  unless it's perfect for  me, I'm not running 
[03:09:30]  around being an actor  for hire.  Do you know what I  mean?  Right, right.  Well, it's always work  doing your own thing.  I mean, Jesus.  Can you mention, I saw  you tweeting about  Derek last night.  I'm confused.  You're bringing that  to America?  Well, it's just a pilot  episode that I put out  but if I do a series,  yeah, I'd love it.  But it premiered in  England last night,  it's just a little  one-off, yeah, and it  went down a storm.  It's about a guy, a  group of autograph  hunters.  They're sort of  outsiders, they're sort  of those weird little  nerds.  You might have seen  them, these guys.  But then you sort of get 
[03:10:00]  to know them and you  realise that they're  nice and kind and they  don't hurt anyone and  it's based on, we've got  a show called Secret  Millionaire in England  and I always notice that  the people who, they go  into, you know, the  find who needs money and  the people who are  helping the people have  got nothing themselves.  They've got terrible  lives.  Oh, shit.  You know, but they're  the ones that are  dedicating their life to  helping other people and  I thought that's what  gave me the idea so I  said it in an old  people's home and I 
[03:10:30]  don't know what it's  like here, but in  England, we seem to  forget our elderly a  bit.  It's like where there's  It's the same here.  There's such an  arrogance of youth as  well where they go,  how old?  Well, that's the one  thing that's definitely  going to happen to you.  If you're lucky, you're  definitely going to be  that one.  But that's why we  don't want to look at  it.  That's why we don't  want to look at it.  We're like, yeah.  We want to just  believe that's not  happening.  That's the foundation of  spirituality as well,  isn't it?  We don't want to think  that we won't be around  us, Don.  We need some kind of 
[03:11:00]  That's it, yeah.  Or people say, what's  the point?  Which is strange because  that to me makes life  more precious.  That's why I want to  try everything and be  kind and be, you know.  This is the point.  This is the point.  Animals don't sit  around going, why are  we here?  They just go.  They just go, go, go.  They get on with it.  Yeah, that's the truth.  Got too heavy, didn't  it?  No, I like it.  It's great.  But it is a philosophy  that takes a lot of  discipline.  Well, it's also because  it's such an unpopular  view.  Yeah.  I'm the bringer of bad 
[03:11:30]  news.  You're the grim reaper.  Exactly.  This is Shoot the  Messenger.  What do you mean there's  no afterlife and this is  all I've got?  Fuck you.  Shut up.  That's what, that's,  that's, you know, I  understand that.  You will be shocked as  shit, though, if you're  standing before God and  going, oh, no.  Well, I'm just  Awkward.  I'm just creating a new  show based on that.  Oh, really?  I'm creating a show  with Clyde Phillips.  Stop creating.  Yes.  I know.  Making us all seem  lazy.  You're an overachiever.  I like the creating,  then I get bored with  it quickly.  The creating bit. 
[03:12:00]  Exactly.  I've created over a  thousand shows this year  and I made one of  them.  That's healthy, though.  People want to know if  you're hitting on  Ricky Gervais, Ant.  Well, you know what?  Is that a little bit?  He's an attractive man.  Okay.  And I enjoy his shows.  His philosophy and  personality are very  good.  So it's my mind, mainly.  I guess, yes.  You don't treat me like  a sex object.  It's a combination of  the two.  And, of course, back in  the days when you were  with the band.  Yeah.  Wow.  Very mod look to you. 
[03:12:30]  I couldn't have gone to  prison then, could I?  Oof.  That would have been a  rough time.  Now I think I'd get  away with it.  Rough time.  Now I think I'd be  left alone.  Yeah.  You think you could  just go to the  cafeteria, go to the  laundry room, and  alone with nary  a problem, right?  I'd like to do their  taxes or something.  Sucking your cock is  good, but how about  this?  What if I save you on  your VAT?  We should ask him  the question we were  trying to figure out  earlier.  I just thought of that. 
[03:13:00]  And this would be  perfect for Carl,  actually.  Yeah.  You want to explain  really fast?  So there's a  transsexual...  Oh.  Oh, that question.  Yeah.  There's a transsexual  woman, used to be a  guy.  Now she's a girl with  a cock named  Bailey J.  Hold on.  Sorry, I've got to  get the chronology  right here.  Wait a minute.  Punch up the  picture, Sam.  What was he born?  Born a man.  She was born a man.  Now she's a girl  with a dick.  She still has the  dick.  Okay, right.  And he could  It's a pre-op 
[03:13:30]  transsexual.  Basically, yeah.  She's got tits and  everything.  Yeah, hormones, but  no, nothing.  Not that one.  Yeah, everything  girl except...  Get a hot one.  Get a hot one.  And I'm obsessed  with her.  I think she's...  I don't have a thing  for transsexuals,  but there's something  about her I find  her incredibly  attractive.  In the balls.  I don't know.  Go to the one,  Diana.  There's something  about her.  There's something  about you that's  so different.  It's like... 
[03:14:00]  It's like...  I'm tired of these  girls with vaginas.  I need something  different.  These vagina girls,  as I call them.  But you, honey,  you've got something...  You've got something  special.  It's a challenge.  Can I just say  I'm not laughing  at this person.  Of course not.  I'm laughing at his  obsession and saying...  Well, we've been  laughing at him  for a while about this  thing.  We'll all be apologizing.  And she has a  fully functioning  penis.  Fully functioning  penis. 
[03:14:30]  Now, she's got...  Fully functioning.  What are all the  functions that this  can do?  It's like buying a  car.  Joe, go ahead.  Explain.  You're an  I...  Explain.  Well, that's the  way we talked about  earlier because we...  Well, hold on a  second.  So, she's got a  polar opposite now  named Buck Angel.  See, that's  Bailey.  This is Buck Angel.  Now, this is Buck  Angel.  Hold on.  What's that?  So, hold on.  This is Bailey Jay.  That has a penis.  That has a penis.  That's a boy.  That was a born...  She...  He...  What do I call it? 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  What does it want?  What does it call it?  Chick with a dick.  She's a chick with a dick.  No, she doesn't want to  be called chick with a dick.  Just she.  I think she does.  I think she likes she.  What's her name?  Bailey.  Bailey.  So, she's saying I'm a  woman now.  Yes.  Okay, but I've got a dick.  But has a penis and  testicle.  That works.  To each their own?  Yes.  This is Buck.  Or did she...  That's hers.  She kept it from before.  Okay.  Now, this is Buck Angel.  And he's a man.  Well...  But Buck was born a woman  and still has complete 
[03:15:30]  women parts.  Vagina, everything.  That's a woman.  Okay.  Well...  And tattoos.  Right.  But he still has his vagina.  Yeah.  Okay.  She was born a...  She was a model, even.  Do you have a vagina picture  of Buck Angel?  I know.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to.  It's fine.  Come on.  It's fine.  You shared a lot with us.  We want to share back.  You have your dumb safety on,  I think, on your shirt.  Whose computer is that?  All right.  That's...  Oh, my goodness.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, exactly.  Okay.  Not making fun.  We're just kind of amazed.  Yeah.  Very amazed.  Because Buck Angel threatens people. 
[03:16:00]  Well...  Yeah.  Threaten Joe.  We've discussed this on the show before  about what would you rather do,  have sex with Buck Angel in his vagina  or suck Billy J's dick?  And that's the question for you today, Ricky.  Now, Ricky, it's the nudie-wed game.  Yeah.  So this is the question.  Dan, Dan, Dan.  Dan, Dan, Dan.  Dan, Dan, Dan.  Dan, Dan, Dan.  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.  Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan.  But with questions like this.  This is the question.  How long have you been married?  How long have you been married?  Okay.  Well, this is the first question.  It's very...  I asked your wife.  Well, your husband said...  Look, we understand it's not an easy... 
[03:16:30]  Oh, he definitely suck a dick.  He definitely suck a dick.  The funniest part,  when we first did this discussion,  Jim Florenti was here,  and he goes,  he goes,  come on,  what would you rather do?  And he goes,  and I go,  I guess I'd suck a dick,  but I go,  I couldn't swallow.  And he goes,  he goes,  he goes...  He's too big of a star for this.  I think you might be too big of a star for this.  Hold on.  So the...  So the...  So it's a girl  who's pretending to be a man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what... 
[03:17:00]  It's a man.  It's definitely...  It's a man.  That's a man,  but a woman.  So would you rather...  Would you rather...  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I mean,  I know I'm taking it more seriously than you should.  No.  We all took it very seriously.  No,  we like the serious angle of this.  It's very confusing.  I was saying it is absolutely the Kobayashi Maru.  See,  hold on.  From Star Trek.  Is it the...  Is it the event that's terror  all the rest of your life?  Yeah,  because you do then have to live. 
[03:17:30]  Well,  I have my answer.  I have my answer.  I would...  And this is when I got threatened with...  When I said this about Buck Angel...  Be careful.  Be careful.  The threatening tweet.  I said I could not get an erection  for this man with the vagina.  No,  you're going down on the person.  Yeah,  no,  I would...  No,  I'm going girl cock  all the fucking way.  I go...  I go guy...  Sorry that I felt the need to go like this  as I said it,  too.  I said I go guy with the vagina.  Close your eyes. 
[03:18:00]  Oh,  there you go.  Close your eyes.  But you're going to feel male thighs  around your head.  Oh,  that's a...  Oh,  really?  There's what you're talking.  It is a woman.  All right,  wait,  wait.  All right,  there's what you're talking about.  That's what Joe's talking about.  Now,  Joe,  you would do that.  Oh,  come on.  That's not only a dick,  that's the biggest dick in the world.  That's just ridiculous.  That is...  That's just rubbing salt in the wound.  That's not...  Oh,  God.  There's your choices. 
[03:18:30]  There's your choices,  Rick.  Come on,  Ricky.  Hey,  hey,  hey,  come on.  That is terrible.  Yeah,  A or B,  Ricky,  A or B.  Oh,  that is awful  when you put it like that.  No.  Would you like us to take a picture of this?  Because know what I would really want?  It's a no-win scenario.  I want Carl to answer this question.  Oh,  man.  Yeah.  This is the ultimate question for Carl,  I think.  Do you mind if I don't take a picture of that?  Yeah,  yeah.  You know what?  I'll just describe it to him.  Because I'll tell you now,  I will never forget that as long as I live.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah. 
[03:19:00]  But Joe DeRosa,  you're totally fine with that.  Joe goes with B,  I go with A.  I'm going B.  And what are you going?  Man,  you are going to choke.  I'm going without an answer.  You have to answer.  You have to answer.  You are going to choke on that.  Yeah,  you're really going to have a hard time.  You have to answer it.  When you're eye to eye with that thing,  Joe,  you'd back out.  I think if you really pretended,  it would just be like  she was wearing a strap on. 
[03:19:30]  I love the fact  this started off  with me being an intellectual  and talking about quantum physics.  That's the beauty of the show.  Are you going to ask the same questions  to Stephen fucking Hawking  when he's in?  That's where the question came from.  It came from that physics documentary  that I watched.  Unbelievable.  I would suck the dick.  My universe is expanding.  Good.  Holy shit.  That's terrible.  Another highbrow conversation. 
[03:20:00]  Exactly.  Exactly.  I hope you didn't push it too far with you.  Every day is the end of my career,  but usually it's my own fault.  We really brush right up against it.  I hope we didn't.  And if you're Joe,  you put it in your mouth.  Go too far.  It's Ricky Gervais on Twitter.  Yeah.  Ricky Gervais on Twitter.  Obviously a great one to follow.  Yes.  And he does balance it out  with the plugs  and the good tweets.  He's a great follow.  We talk about how some guys  just all they do is plug  and those suck after a while.  That's a joke I used to do.  Like Louis C.K. 
[03:20:30]  Like Louis fucking C.K.,  a friend of ours.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're right.  Are you going to be on...  I'm going to joke every once in a while.  Are you going to be on Louis' show at all...  Oh, I've done it a couple of times.  Yeah, I've seen the ones you've been on.  No, I love that character, Dr. Ben.  It was great fun  and it was...  I like the way Louis films.  He films like me,  nine to three.  He does it because he has to drop his kids off  and pick them up.  I do it because I just, you know,  I've got things to do.  I spend that much time.  You're a busy man.  Yeah.  Because, yeah, 
[03:21:00]  that doctor character is fantastic.  It's really great fun.  Yeah.  All right, listen,  Ricky Gervais,  God, we love that you still do our show, man.  Yes, thanks.  We really appreciate that.  It was great fun.  The Ricky Gervais show, season three.  I've still got to...  Just before I'm trying to interrupt you  and you're plugging my show,  but I've still got the phrase,  it's girl cock all the way.  I mean,  that's pretty much the t-shirt  that I want to see  around the world.  It's girl cock all the way.  You can have the copyright.  It's girl cock all the way. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  I'll give it a new album.  Please tell...  Please...  Please ask that question to Carl for us.  It's on the Jay Leno.  Welcome to girl cock all the way.  That's fantastic.  No worries, man.  The Ricky Gervais show, season three,  premieres next Friday, April 20th,  on HBO.  Thank you, guys.  It was a pleasure again, man.  That was great fun.  Yeah.  Thanks for coming in.  I guess we're done, too.  I think we're done.  You're going to wash my eyes out.  Yeah, yeah.  Should do that.  Joe DeRosa? 
[03:22:00]  Joe DeRosa comedy on Twitter.  Just make CDs on iTunes, please.  All right.  Cool.  See you Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Ricky Gervais, everyone.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM. </pre>
