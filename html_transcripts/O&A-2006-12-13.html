<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with bizarre sound effects and crude, sexually explicit jokes from Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Norton recounted a drinking incident from rehab.  The hosts discussed a slow news day, focusing on Paris Hilton's alleged cocaine use and other celebrity substance abuse (Nicole Richie and Lindsay Lohan).  They dissected fake viral videos, particularly one of Pauly Shore and a hot tub video, analyzing their fakery.  They also boasted about their own viral video success.

A segment followed about Councilman John Liu's criticism of Rosie O'Donnell, and their failed attempts to have him on the show.  They encouraged Asian listeners to call in with jokes and played audio of the fake Pauly Shore video.  They discussed rejecting Frank Stallone as a guest, contrasting him with Sylvester Stallone. A caller shared a traumatic assault in a rehab shower, leading to further discussion about rehabs, with Norton sharing his own rehab experiences and desire to stay in Ozzy Osbourne's room at the Betty Ford Center.

The broadcast then moved to a Holocaust denial convention in Tehran, speculated on David Duke's involvement, and satirically discussed Auschwitz's potential commercialization.  Norton recounted witnessing a public sex act in Tijuana as a child, and Anthony shared unusual childhood experiences, including his father's erratic behavior.  A story about a child accidentally shot in the Mojave Desert was recounted, followed by a caller describing disturbing remnants of a concentration camp in Germany juxtaposed with nearby vendors.  German video game censorship was briefly discussed. The show concluded with promotion of their "WOW" campaign (women flashing drivers with stickers) and Nortonâ€™s successful confrontation with a laptop company after threatening to destroy the malfunctioning laptop on air.

The show continued with a segment focused on the Holocaust denial conference in Iran, hosted by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, expressing disbelief and anger at his actions.  A clip of a French professor demanding proof of the Holocaust was played and ridiculed.  The hosts compared Holocaust and slavery denial to 9/11 conspiracy theories and delved into anti-Semitic conspiracy theories involving a fictional "Voss."  Extended audio of a rambling, incoherent interview with the Iron Sheik, including a Holocaust denial, was played for comedic effect.

Significant technical difficulties ensued, with Opie spilling water on the mixing board causing microphone malfunctions.  The resulting chaos and humorous reactions formed a large part of the segment.  This led to discussions of their eating habits during commercial breaks.  "MacBook Karaoke," featuring listener-submitted audio recordings, followed, with humorous commentary on the singers.  A purportedly staged photo of Paris Hilton using cocaine was also discussed.  More technical difficulties, banter, and a caller describing an encounter with "Half a Hulk Face," a disfigured homeless man, concluded this section, along with discussion of PalTalk content.

The next segment began with a nonsensical spoken-word piece and an argument between the hosts, escalating into shouting and insults.  A caller, Andrea, attempted to sing "Total Eclipse of the Heart" but was repeatedly interrupted.  More technical difficulties, including spilled water, and frantic attempts by sound engineer Tim to fix the problems dominated.  A "scary news teases" segment satirized local news fear-mongering, discussing real estate agents with criminal records, navigation systems, sex offenders, and a YouTube video of Shred and Reagan pranking sex offenders.  The dangers of the Nintendo Wii were discussed, followed by commentary on internet videos set to Benny Hill music, including an evangelist and a lawyer being shot at by his client. The show continued with discussion of the upcoming homeless shopping spree, and a lengthy criticism of Howard Stern's Letterman appearance, focusing on alleged lies about subscriber numbers, attire, and behavior.  An email from John Minnelli accusing Stern of lying and suggesting an SEC investigation was read.  The chaotic state of the studio and their behavior were joked about. A corporate video shoot disrupted by the hosts and PalTalk users broadcasting explicit content was mentioned.

A heated discussion about Howard Stern, fueled by a recent email and his Letterman appearance, dominated the next segment.  The hosts aggressively criticized Stern, using highly offensive language, focusing on perceived lies, self-importance, exaggerations, and hypocrisy.  They discussed co-worker Elo's desk, speculated about his drinking, and suggested a prank involving a Washington D.C. employee.  They also claimed Stern invented reality TV, MTV Unplugged, and The View, contrasting this with their own success on Letterman.  Numerous crude sexual jokes and references were made throughout.  A combative interaction with long-time employee Patty, including a forceful hair-cutting event, occurred.  The segment ended with further insults toward Stern and promotion of show segments and website content, including "Money Snatch."

The final segment centered on Patty, Danny (a male guest), and the hosts engaging in a prolonged, vulgar and sexually charged interaction.  The conversation revolved around Patty's hair, leading to inappropriate propositions involving shaving her pubic hair, spanking her, and other sexual acts. Crude jokes about Patty's body, age, and bodily functions were made, with repeated references to her genitalia and defecation.  A negotiation where Patty agreed to be spanked by Norton and have Danny shave her pubic hair in exchange for not shaving her head occurred, and the acts were carried out on air.  Discussions about "pests" spreading their content and a Howard Stern rumor were also included.  The segment ended with promotion of their "Wow Stickers" merchandise.  The extremely offensive language continued throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  Like the consequences of a killer epidemic.  One goes in, millions come out. Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied, and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next victim, so there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can. 
[00:00:30]  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up a failure.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a whore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he he.  Ovi.  Ovi, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton. 
[00:01:00]  I'm dancing.  I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Oh!  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Ha!  Ha!  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  But with Jimmy, you never know.  It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Ovi and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. of A.  And...  I hate you. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Fud, fud, fud.  Good morning.  Good morning. 
[00:02:00]  Hello.  What about you, Jimmy?  Jesus.  A good morning from you today?  Oh, I...  Hey, there it is.  Hey, welcome to the Ovi and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  What is America talking about today?  What do you think America's talking about today, Anthony?  What is America talking about today?  What is, like, Philly talking about today?  Philly?  What is Chicago talking about today? 
[00:02:30]  How about Boston?  What are they talking about today?  What about New York?  What are we talking about today?  Well...  How about Cleveland and Buffalo?  What are they talking about today?  What's the big news?  Dallas, what about you?  What about you?  Dallas.  What's the big story in your city?  Give us a call.  Honestly, there's not much going on in New York today.  There really isn't.  One day closer to Christmas.  Yeah.  The front page of the paper is kind of boring today. 
[00:03:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  Pretty much.  John Lou.  You know when they don't have the same headline on both of your local papers that there isn't, like, a huge story going on.  I know it's a slow news day when, on page three of the Post, they got Paris Hilton.  I guess she's in New York City.  Yeah.  And the whole page, pretty much, is Paris Hilton with a close-up of her nose.  And they're basically claiming she did coke during lunch yesterday. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  Good for Paris.  That's it.  Keeps her weight down.  Keeps the girls' weight down.  No sign of what's going on in Iraq.  Do you think these girls are disciplined enough to not eat?  Do you think, like, these, like, Nicole Richie, who weighs 80 pounds and just got busted for driving under the influence of Vicodin and pot?  Do you think that these girls have discipline in any way, shape, or form to go, you know, I don't really want to eat that? 
[00:04:00]  They need something to offset it.  I'm suggesting, perhaps, they might be using some type of appetite suppressant.  You know, cocaine.  There's many things they could be suggesting.  Yeah, they could be, what?  Or, like, Slim Fast or something, or the AIDS diet plan. 
[00:04:30]  Something to get the poopies out faster.  Something.  Something to get the poopies out.  Yeah.  These girls got to be doing it.  Lindsay Lohan, though, is, thank God, a week without a drink.  Oh, wow.  Is what she said.  What can I tell you about that?  God bless.  God bless.  Jimmy, when you got off to drinking, after a week of not drinking, did you go back?  Did you have any stumbles, or did you just say you're not drinking anymore and stop? 
[00:05:00]  I did drink, but it wasn't, I was kind of forced into rehab when I was 17.  Oh.  So I didn't want to be sober.  So I drank in the rehab.  In rehab?  Yeah.  Wait, you could drink in rehab?  No.  Well, how'd you get the booze?  They don't allow it.  I know they don't allow it.  Try the wine.  No, obviously you can't drink in rehab.  That's not what I'm getting at.  I mean, how easy is it to get booze?  I, uh, well, my room, we had been, once a week or twice we would go out for meetings, 
[00:05:30]  outside meetings, outside the rehab.  So, um, my roommate Dwayne, who's a guy from Trenton, and our friend Harvey, who was an  older guy.  Harvey?  Yeah, Harvey was a weird guy with a mustache who would go, brr, and make these weird little  like noises, and, uh, they copped alcohol after a meeting.  And, uh...  Wouldn't they supervise these people so they couldn't...  No, not in a meeting.  They would come get you in a little while.  Yeah, so you could just go to a liquor store and...  Yeah, so Dwayne had a pint of wine, and a half pint of vodka, and we drank them in our  room, and then I bragged about it to someone else, and they ratted me out to the counselor 
[00:06:00]  so I'm going to go to the higher rehab.  They're asking me, like, uh, did you drink?  And I was like, Michael Corleone.  I'm like, no, I did not drink.  I did not.  And, uh, so yeah.  And I got you.  And I got out, too.  And my grandmother, I remember, was holding a plastic cup, and my mother goes, Jimmy's  been drinking.  And my grandmother went, ooh, and knocked her plastic cup over.  It was, like, the worst, it was, like, the worst vaudeville reaction ever.  Oh!  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, cup over.  It's amazing, the little things you remember. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, I know.  The little fumble with the cup.  Ooh!  And then, I guess, uh, so yeah, you stumbled a couple of times then.  Yeah, 10 years later, I...  You realized it's in your own best interest.  Yeah.  And, uh, and to this day, Jimmy doesn't drink or do drugs.  No.  Good boy.  He, uh, tries to be a good boy.  Yes, yes.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  Yesterday, we almost played something, um, and, uh, we probably would have told everyone 
[00:07:00]  it was real, because I think it was Danny came running in here all excited, uh, with  the Pauly Shore audio.  Have you heard about Pauly Shore yet?  No.  Oh, God.  How desperate is this guy for attention?  He was trying to pull off, like, an Andy Kaufman, like, uh, uh, uh, uh,  Who else?  Like, uh...  Uh, Kramer?  Maybe a Kramer.  Just an outrageous thing happening on stage at a comedy club.  This seems to be what, uh, comics, um, that really don't have much going on are doing 
[00:07:30]  now.  Yeah, get up on stage.  You know that there's gonna be some kind of camera rolling, uh, whether it's a, a little  video camera or a cell phone or something, and have something outrageous happen, get  it on YouTube, and you're gonna be a sensation.  Yeah.  So he, um, did it, and, uh, I watched it yesterday.  Um, and right away was like, oh, this is such crap.  As soon as I saw it, too.  Fake, fake, fake. 
[00:08:00]  You can tell.  Fake.  Like, and, and the, the weird thing about YouTube is, it doesn't matter what you see.  You can, you watch the Hindenburg crashing on YouTube, and there'll be, the comment section,  dude, so fake.  Dude, that was so fake.  Could you see the way it burned?  Fake, fake, fake.  Uh, there's always somebody saying that every video on there is fake.  Uh, so I saw a couple of comments saying this is so fake, watched it, and, uh, yeah, fake, 
[00:08:30]  phony, badly acted, like a bad wrestling bit, where this big hick, Paulie's on stage, um,  he's doing his act, he's getting heckled by this big cowboy guy in, uh, Texas, I guess.  In Texas, right?  Houston or whatever?  Odessa.  Odessa, okay, right.  So, uh, this big hillbilly, fat cowboy guy comes up on stage and, uh, starts, uh, mouthing  off to him, and Paulie's, like, saying, hey, I'm doing my thing or whatever, and the guy  comes over and punches him in the face. 
[00:09:00]  But you can see he, like, slips the punch badly.  It's like a horrendous fake punch.  Really bad.  From a 19, late 70s.  Looks like a bad Western punch.  His head goes back and down before the fist even gets close to his face.  They show it in slow motion, like, three times.  I mean, the guy's a big boy.  He's on stage with, uh, Paulie Shore.  We're kind of looking at the video right now.  He's got a cowboy hat on, and Paulie's trying to be tough on stage. 
[00:09:30]  He's like, come on, man, I'm just doing my act.  And then, and then right before the guy punches him out, Paulie's like, all right, all right,  all right, all right.  You know, he doesn't want to get hit.  Yeah.  And then, look, there it is.  And they actually lighten the video up to show that, because it's very dark, they lighten  it up to show that, look at his head, it goes down before the punch ever lands.  They were laughing at him.  Yeah.  It was that bad.  It was so bad, the crowd was laughing at him.  And then he gets up from the punch. 
[00:10:00]  Well, actually, after the cowboy punches him, here comes the cop to pull the cowboy off  the stage.  Then they tend to Paulie, who's on the ground, and Paulie gets up and says something to the  crowd, I don't know exactly what, and marches off stage, and they're kind of laughing like,  you idiot.  How desperate are you?  It was so badly done.  And then the cops, I guess, came out with a statement that said that that officer was  on duty, and he was asked by Paulie beforehand to participate in this little gag, and everything 
[00:10:30]  went fine.  No one was injured.  So it's like, is that the new thing that the comics that have nothing going on are going  to be doing?  No, I think it's just Paulie trying to make a YouTube video.  I think everyone is so aware of the popularity of viral videos and YouTube and stuff, and they're  all out there thinking, what can I do to get one of those videos?  Because we all see it.  You go to these sites, and you see a video that's getting 2 million hits.  We were lucky enough to get one. 
[00:11:00]  You know, our baby bird's up to like 1.3 million views on break.com.  I said it the other day.  Some guy titled his video, Britney Spears, you know, area.  Right, right, right.  That was uncovered, falls out.  That's what it was called.  The video was just the title.  And all it consisted of was the opening credits of the old Martin Landau series Space 1999  with a split-second clip of Britney Spears in the middle of it, and you couldn't see 
[00:11:30]  anything, you know, the good parts.  So it wound up being one of the most viewed videos that day, just from the title.  And people are bashing him and calling him an ass and everything.  But I thought it was pretty funny that just from the title alone, this guy gets the most  popular video.  And it was nothing but the opening credits of a horrible science fiction series from the  70s.  Right.  Hey, the Paulie Shore videos on opianthony.com.  Speaking of fake videos, before we move on, have you guys seen the hot tub video of the 
[00:12:00]  hot chick?  A tub girl?  A tub girl.  I love it.  I've only a photo.  No, a tub girl?  No, no, not tub girl.  Oh, I thought you meant tub girl.  We've all seen tub girl, one of the most disgusting photos ever taken.  Oh, I'll tell you who didn't see it, my girlfriend.  Oh, no.  But the other day, she received an email from me as I was in the same room that said,  I love this pic of us.  And when she opened it, I knew because I heard, oh!  You sent her tub girl? 
[00:12:30]  I sent her tub girl.  If anyone needed to be in a tub at that very moment, it was tub girl.  She certainly did.  Right.  The little guys are of fun.  I'm going to try to keep this clean because, you know, we don't want Al dumping out.  Don't dump out.  Al, help us out here.  We've got to still be edgy.  How's the butt now?  Al.  Oh, okay.  All right, Al.  Listen and press the button.  Maybe he hasn't had his morning coffee yet.  We'll see. 
[00:13:00]  But there's a video.  It's like one of the number.  It's the top video on pretty much all the sites, YouTube, Break.com, and some other places.  It is so fake, it's not even funny.  And it's up to like two million views.  Two million views.  It's basically three or four people in a hot tub outside.  The camera's perfectly placed.  I've seen that, yeah.  There's lighting that lights up the water perfectly and the people.  And there's supposedly just a bunch of people hanging out in a hot tub like we've all done a million effing times. 
[00:13:30]  And all of a sudden a girl panics and stands up real fast and the water turns brown.  And then everyone freaks out and jumps out of the hot tub.  This thing is getting viewed like crazy.  It is so fake.  Yeah, all set up.  But then you read the comments and people are buying it like it's real.  No one knows what's real or fake out there anymore.  How naive people are to believe it.  But then there's, like I said, the cynics that think everything is fake. 
[00:14:00]  So it's just, it's the Wild West of video.  It is.  You just don't know.  I hang people send me the video like YouTube.  Stop sending them to me.  I don't watch them.  I won't download them.  I don't want to open them from my computer.  I won't watch them.  Yeah.  No.  You send me a, you know, tell me what it's about.  I'll go find it.  But if it's popular enough for anyone to send me, I've seen it already.  Hey, here it is.  Look, Jimmy, really fast.  I've seen this one.  Oh, you have seen this one.  It looks like someone throws, like, stew in the tub.  Stew.  Watch, yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, look.  Come on.  Oh, stop it.  Just how they're jumping out of the tub and the girls are.  Badly acted.  And the girls are, like, models.  The guy's a model.  It's, like, not real people in a hot tub.  Why are they videotaping?  That's another thing.  The biggest thing to these fake videos is you've got to ask yourself, why are they videotaping  this in the first place?  Yeah.  Like, I like people that videotape themselves cutting down a tree and the tree falls on a  garage or a car or something.  It's like, why are you setting up a shot of you cutting a tree down? 
[00:15:00]  Just stop it.  Fake.  The best things to watch on YouTube are the fights.  I don't care who's fighting.  Black, white.  Midgets.  Midgets.  The midget fight is getting viewed like crazy from Jerry Springer.  For some reason, kid fights are very fun.  Fat kid fights.  Fat kid fights.  A bunch of chubby little kids.  There's a video of a chubby kid and he's being picked on and then he just beats the crap out 
[00:15:30]  of this other kid.  Kids fighting hysterical.  Absolutely.  Adults fighting hysterical.  Absolutely.  All I like to watch is live concert videos.  That's all I want to see.  Is that what you want?  Yeah, that.  If it's not that, it's right to Ogresh.  I skip all the fun.  If it's not Sabbath, your head's coming off.  I cannot deal with those.  No way.  All right.  We're just getting warmed up.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:16:00]  We got another MacBook to give away.  MacBook karaoke is happening.  Karaoke.  I hope we have some good contestants today.  We also have a report about one out of eight of us is racist.  Only one out of eight.  One of eight?  Well, the rest of that study didn't really show that.  Is John Liu calling today?  We want John Liu.  Where is he?  Do we have a John Liu update?  We're trying to get him on the phone.  Come on.  We want to talk about Ching Chong Ching with John Liu. 
[00:16:30]  But he's kind of dodging us.  And we got news teases.  We got all sorts of stuff.  They're still bringing in all the fine material you're going to hear on the show today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Everyone and I came up with something years ago.  Basically, it says,  Whip them out Wednesday.  Big, luscious, juicy ones.  Wow.  The swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Wow.  It's Whip them out Wednesday. 
[00:17:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Sorry to inform everybody, but we said no to having Frank Stallone on our show. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, that was a tough decision.  Holy crap.  We have a professional booker for this radio show.  The other day, we were offered Frank Stallone because he did what?  The opening song for the new Rocky movie?  How about you get his brother?  Did he?  How about you get his brother?  Sly.  How about you get Sly?  He needs all the promotion he could get.  But no, we're offered Frank Stallone. 
[00:18:00]  Frank did the music.  And that's how it was presented to us.  Hey, you know, Frank Stallone does the opening song in the movie.  Would you like to have him in studio?  I don't think the opening song is like the big song.  I think it's Eye of the Tiger again.  He's dipping into every well possible.  It's just the worst.  The worst.  I'd rather talk to Frank Stallone, and I have more respect for his acting lately than I do for what Sly is doing his age. 
[00:18:30]  But that's how pathetic we are.  That's how pathetic we are as a radio show.  We don't get Sly Stallone.  We get offered Frank Stallone.  That says it all right there.  That's got to be a tough gig, me and Frank Stallone.  Wow.  It's like you're Stallone.  You kind of look like him.  Kind of sound like him a little bit.  But you're not him.  No, you're just a little short there.  People don't really want to meet you.  And the other thing, really fast, John Liu, the councilman that was all over Rosie for doing the ching-chong-ching crap. 
[00:19:00]  He's dodging us.  He's dodging us.  We have left multiple messages for John Liu to call the show, or we'll call him, obviously, to talk about this Asian racism that, you know.  He's obsessed with.  He's obsessed with.  Come on.  You know, we got a huge forum here, but he's dodging us.  Yeah, in fact, he knows that we bash him, and we think that he's a dope, and he's used to people just cowering when he talks because they're afraid he's going to boycott.  Well, we don't have a tremendous amount of Asian listeners, and even if we did, we're just not afraid of you. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  I'm afraid of him.  We have plenty of Asian listeners, and they should call our show and do some ching-chong jokes for us today.  Absolutely.  Right.  Some Asian jokes by Asians.  That's what we should do today.  That's right.  Asian jokes by Asians.  That's right.  And we also need the ONA pest to kind of ask John Liu why he's not coming on our show.  We talk to a lot of people, a lot of people in New York alone where this story is really hot because he's a councilman here in New York City.  Why won't he come on our show for a few minutes? 
[00:20:00]  Stop dodging us.  All right.  And we start the show by talking about Pauly Shore getting, quote, knocked out on stage down there in Odessa.  Fake.  We got the audio.  Here it is.  A few people thought this was real, but now finally the cop is saying, look, man, you know, Pauly talked to me beforehand and said, I'm going to do a little thing.  Can you help me out here?  Oh, this is one for the archives.  Basically.  Great audio.  Basically saying, can you help out my career?  Because no one has been talking about Pauly Shore for many, many years. 
[00:20:30]  No.  Another guest we get offered all the time.  Hey, Pauly Shore.  Pauly Shore.  No.  Start getting us real guests, please.  So this is Pauly Shore setting up the whole thing where I guess someone was heckling.  That was that was a plant.  And then Pauly Shore is like, you know, hey, man, stop heckling, blah, blah, blah.  And then the guy gets up on stage with his big cowboy hat, a big, huge dude.  And and fake knocks out Pauly Shore. 
[00:21:00]  This is how it went down.  It's not in the middle of my shit.  He played to be here just like the rest of us.  Well, first of all, shut up.  Moss.  Come up here.  No, no, no, bro.  What the fuck?  Dude, stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, bro.  I know, but he was fucking talking during my show.  What's everybody else I've been talking to?  Well, you know what?  That's how it is.  Sometimes people got to shut the fuck up. 
[00:21:30]  I'm not saying anything.  I'm not saying anything.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  Laughing.  Holy crap, man.  They're laughing.  They're booing.  It sounds like a bad wrestling event.  How bummed are you if you're Pauly Shore?  You get, you know, fake knocked out, but you want everyone to believe you got knocked out. 
[00:22:00]  And the reaction you get is, it's just kind of.  It's they're laughing.  There's a few laughs.  He hits you.  Right.  Yeah.  And some people are cheering that you just got, you know, knocked out.  A lot of people are just laughing.  There were people yelling, hit him before.  Right, right, right.  Like, it was so badly set up and executed.  I want to know what was going on in his head.  Get Pauly Shore on our show today, Roland, please.  Oh, I'm sure behind the scenes, he was like, this dude, this is going to be great. 
[00:22:30]  Going to get a lot of press.  It's got on the heels of a whole Michael Richards thing.  It's going to make the news.  It's not even about making the news.  I'm telling you.  He's like, this will be one of those hot videos on YouTube and Break.com and GorillaMass.net  and E-Bomb World or E-Bombs World.  All the big vid sites.  That's right.  And it amounted to nothing.  Let's say hi to Tony.  Tony, what's up?  Morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, you're not going to get John Lou on here to talk about what's going on with the 
[00:23:00]  Asian, you know, with Rosie.  Why?  He's against yellow journalism.  He's what?  We practice yellow journalism, so he's not going to come on.  Yeah, I think so.  Wow.  That joke yesterday.  God, where's Frank Stallone when we need him?  Thanks, Tony.  Andy in Brooklyn, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, listen, I just want to say I'm a big fan of the show and also a new fan of Jimmy  Norton.  Jimmy, I think you're excellent.  Thanks, buddy. 
[00:23:30]  But also, I was in rehab pretty recently, and I'm 40 years old.  And I'm in rehab with these, like, hardened, crackhead, junkie guys, and I got into one  of those scenarios where I'm in the shower.  You know, it's like this big communal shower.  I get frigging jumped by these two young kids.  Oh, sexy.  And I'm in, like, my second day.  I'm like this, you know, I was hooked on Percocets and booze.  I'm in my second day of trying to clean, and I'm this shaky, frigging rattled mess. 
[00:24:00]  These guys come in.  They start grabbing all my stuff.  You know, I kept in, like, this little duffel bag they give you.  And one guy goes to attack me.  I'm trying to defend myself.  I'm all soaked up with, you know, on this tile floor, totally naked.  I get lucky, and I catch this guy in the face, and he falls down, and I go scrambling after him.  Here I am, tearing ass through these, trying to get at the other guys.  They're running away from me. 
[00:24:30]  Man, I was never so terrified as I was at that time.  But those frigging, those houses, they're like houses for animals.  I had to call my wife and get the hell out of there.  I don't know how people go through those rehab stints, man.  Well, I went in Jersey and in Princeton, it wasn't like that kind of place.  You know, it was all, like, regular suburban folks.  Suburban white kids.  Yeah, there was one guy who freaked out and jumped on a pool table, and they had to restrain him.  But that was a big boy, too.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I was tired. 
[00:25:00]  But, Jimmy, I'm really interested when you're going to be performing in New York, man.  I'm such a huge fan.  I'm dying to see it.  Not sure, buddy, to be honest with you.  Sooner or later.  I don't have anything yet lined up.  Atlantic City, Borgata, New Year's Eve.  Oh, yeah.  It's close enough.  Oh, is that right?  It's within range, anyway.  We'll all be down there.  I go down there.  Okay.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  Excellent show, man.  Thank you.  Bye, fella.  Yeah, I never thought about that.  I guess when you go into some of these rehab places, you got some just animals that you  got to be really scared of.  Yeah.  I'm sure you got to go to a nice place. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, I picture a rehab facility where, yeah, it's a few housewives that are pill-popping.  And maybe the guy from Wall Street that just had a little too many after work for too  many years.  Yeah, the ones they show on HBO, those specials.  Yeah, you're not thinking you're in there with crackheads.  Teen girls walking around, making phone calls and crying.  Yeah, maybe a cutter.  Yeah.  Yeah, I picture a rehab.  You got the Wall Street guy, too many drinks, too many happy hours.  You got the pill-popping housewife.  It may be a teenage cutter. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Teen cutter.  That's what I picture.  And a bulimic.  No, it's crackheads and heroin addicts.  Honing their craft of robbery on you.  Right, right.  I was such a nerd when I was told I had to go to rehab.  I said I would only go to Betty Ford Clinic if I could stay in the room that Ozzy stayed in.  You didn't say that.  Oh, yes, I did.  Oh, God.  That is not why you go to rehab, my friend.  Dork.  To get well.  Suburban nerd. 
[00:26:30]  And I got the audio of the story you were talking about.  Hold on.  Let me go to Glenn real fast.  Glenn, what's up?  Hey, you can tell the...  First of all, good morning, boys.  Hi.  You can tell the Pauly Shua thing was fake because there were actually people there.  You think it's like he cast the entire audience?  Now, that would be...  That is pretty funny, actually.  That would be funny.  Well, we're going to...  We can't get anyone to show up.  He's got to go to casting.  Well, let's see if we get Pauly Shua on the show.  We're starting something new today, man. 
[00:27:00]  We're calling people out.  John Lewis hiding.  Is Pauly Shua going to hide?  Come on out.  Well, Pauly Shua has been trying to get on our show for months, and we're like, why do  we want to talk to Pauly Shua?  But finally, there's a reason to talk to Pauly Shua, so maybe he'll call in today.  We'll see.  All right.  Anthony, that story you were looking at in the office, Holocaust deniers held a convention.  Oh, boy.  What is this about?  Well, this sounds like a fair and reasonable and unbiased assessment of the Holocaust. 
[00:27:30]  Mm-hmm.  It was in Iran.  It was hosted by the president of Iran.  And there was some very open-minded, very liberal people there.  David Duke, our own David Duke, was our little envoy.  He was our ambassador.  He was our United States ambassador of goodwill.  So he went to Iran for this convention?  Apparently.  Where was it held?  Somewhere in Iran.  Was it actually in Iran? 
[00:28:00]  I thought it was illegal to travel to Iran.  It was in the town of...  No, no, no.  It was in...  It's not illegal to travel there.  It's just no...  Dan, have a little insight on this?  Where this was?  This little summit that they had in Iran?  It was just in Iran.  Like, you're going to stay in the town and people are going to go, oh, really?  Was it Tehran?  Tehran.  Tehran, Iran. 
[00:28:30]  Tehran.  And Iran.  I just think it's...  I thought it was illegal for Americans to travel there.  And David Duke, you know, he's supposedly an American, I gather.  But it was a fact-finding committee, is what they had.  And they were going over the Holocaust.  Yeah.  And whether it really happened.  And if it did, I mean, come on.  How many Jews really died in it? 
[00:29:00]  I think their final assessment at the end of this was four.  They said four?  Oh, okay.  Teasing, of course, but I'm sure it wasn't much more than that.  Yeah.  Actually, what is Iranian for not enough?  Because I believe that was also uttered.  Well...  Yeah, they had all the bigwigs there from...  They had a French guy.  Uh-huh.  And the French, of course, have always been a little anti-Semitic when it comes to the Holocaust. 
[00:29:30]  You think?  Like, he described the Holocaust as a historical lie.  I guess the films we've seen and, you know, all the records that were kept and the liberation of the camps after World War II.  What's all that?  Enough time goes by.  Ah, you forget about it.  It's the old Titanic ride thing.  Before you know it, there'll be like an Auschwitz land. 
[00:30:00]  But you could just go around.  There'll be like roller coasters and stuff, just like the Titanic slide.  Well, you could visit the concentration camps, obviously.  And I'm sure they're starting to kind of maybe sell a little trinket here and there.  You think?  Ah, you know, they've got to be very careful.  But I bet you they've already started selling some trinkets.  A little souvenir stand?  And then, you know, a few more years go by, it's going to be a full-blown freaking souvenir shop.  You know that will happen eventually. 
[00:30:30]  More and more people are visiting places like Auschwitz.  And as a matter of fact, they had to prop up the ovens.  They've been sinking into the ground.  So they're building walls around them to keep them above ground.  Because I guess it is some kind of a tourist attraction.  People go there.  They have some morbid fascination and want to actually be there.  Or I guess, you know, family members of ancestors want to go there for some reason and be miserable. 
[00:31:00]  But the Iranians and a few other people that are very open-minded have said,  that probably didn't happen.  You wouldn't visit concentration camps?  If I was there, if I would ever go to the filthy continent that is Europe, which I have no ambition to do,  everyone, especially my relatives, they're, you know, all Italian, of course,  they're like, oh, you've got to go to Italy.  You've got to go to Italy.  Why? 
[00:31:30]  Why do I want to go?  I don't want to go to Europe.  I would go to England.  You don't even want to go to Suffolk County.  Yeah.  It's too far.  Which, for the rest of America, is the county right next to where Anthony lives.  I would go to England.  He doesn't want to cross the border into Suffolk County on Long Island.  I'd go to England.  I would go to Ireland.  Yeah.  And as far as Europe is concerned.  Why would you go to Ireland?  That's about it.  I don't know.  They seem like they have cool pubs. 
[00:32:00]  I'd want to go into a pub and have a Guinness, real, you know, Irish pub.  And England seems pretty cool.  Speak the language.  That's another thing.  I don't want to go to France and sit there and have to pull out a little book on, you know,  a medium rare.  How do you say that?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  Where's the craziest place you've ever been?  Craziest place?  Probably Tijuana.  Tijuana, Mexico? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is a whole nother.  Donkey show?  Filthier than any place.  No, I was a little too young to see the donkey show, but I saw a lot of stuff just on the street.  A lot of prostitution.  Right there in the open?  Poor little children.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little back alley action going on.  Guy.  I remember seeing a guy just full action.  Not like, you know, little foreplay action.  Full action right next to a dumpster. 
[00:33:00]  And the girl was holding on to the dumpster with one hand.  And, like, turning around and watching the guy.  And how old were you?  Probably 12.  So what, Daddy took you to Tijuana, Mexico?  Yeah.  And we were looking for some bar that he had remembered, maybe remembered going to at some  point when he visited.  And we were walking down some back little alleyway.  And there was just, you heard the little, and I remember hearing the little dumpster wheel 
[00:33:30]  squeaking as it turned a little bit, because this Mexican was just, wow.  And I'm sure your dad, being a responsible father, covered your eyes and got you the  hell out of there, right?  No, it was a big laugh.  And, hey, look at that.  And then I'm sure he made some kind of a Mexican racist joke.  And for the new listeners, I'm convinced Anthony had the greatest dad ever.  Oh, yeah.  Ever.  He got him a girl at what age?  It was my 13th birthday.  13th birthday.  I got a shiny 10-speed bike. 
[00:34:00]  Anthony got a whore.  I got, no, she was a 19-year-old friend of the family.  No, she wasn't.  Friend of the family.  No, we knew her for years.  She was kind of loose.  You know, she was kind of loosey-goosey around the people that we frequented.  I was going to say, how do you think dad knew that she was going to give you a little  action?  She was very popular around the stable, let's say, around the ranch.  Why? 
[00:34:30]  Was she funny?  Yeah.  A load of laughs.  Is that why she was popular?  Without the laughs.  Was she good at Sudoku?  Yeah.  Really popular.  She, yeah.  One time, she dragged me out of a restaurant out there in California because the  original Mexican guy that she wanted to have sex with had passed out in his eggs.  We were all having breakfast after a night of drinking at 13. 
[00:35:00]  And you were 13.  Let's know.  Make sure.  And she was, you know, like rubbing this guy's leg and everything, and he had just  fallen asleep in his eggs.  And she kind of turned around and looked at me.  She goes, all right, I guess it's you.  And he just grabbed my arm and took me out of the place.  And my father went, I'll see you tomorrow.  And that was it.  You know, back to the house.  Your dad was amazing.  For some action.  I wish I could have met him. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, was he a rip?  What a trooper.  You're just hanging out there drinking at 13 in a bar and then going home with one of  the broads.  I get home from junior high with a short walk from Marco Forrester, Marco Forrester junior  high.  And I'd walk down to the stables where we kept our horses and there would be my father  and Uncle Chato, Tio Chato, our Mexican friend, just swilling these huge forties of bud, just 
[00:36:00]  drinking.  And even at that age, I'm just like, why don't they work?  You know?  And they were always just complaining about, ah, unemployment running rampant.  Oh, geez.  It's so hard to.  But it's like, and then he'd get like a job for a week.  I was going to say, let's go look for jobs.  Let's go look for jobs.  No.  Always getting in fights.  He's like 13 years old and we'd pull into this underground parking garage under a place 
[00:36:30]  called the Franciscan, which is a big tourist trap because it was San Juan Capistrano, so  it was just full of tourists.  Right, right.  Obviously, the swallows and the mission.  And we'd get out and they were constantly, like my father and all of his friends and everything,  constantly just drunk and starting fights with the tourists because it's like a goddamn  tourist.  And constantly starting brawls.  And I'd be like the little guy.  So I'm the easiest target to go after for these tourists when the fight would break out. 
[00:37:00]  So like the big guys come running after me and I have to like go bolting up these stairs.  And then one time I turned around and kicked a guy and he kind of fell down the stairs a  little bit.  And one thing I got to say, my father always did look after me during those altercations  because as the guy was trying to catch his balance on the stairs by grabbing the handrail,  my father grabbed it by the hair and pulled him just off balance backwards and then proceeded  to smash his head on one of those parking blocks in the garage that stopped your time. 
[00:37:30]  And then all I know is like cops were everywhere throwing us all against the wall.  And there I am, like my hands against the wall, just a little guy getting frisked.  Took my little buck knife as my father was making faces at me next to me.  It was just that.  What kind of faces?  Like sticking his tongue out and laughing.  It was just a, it was a mad house. 
[00:38:00]  It was a mad house.  And I want to remind people, you were 13 years old.  13.  He'd throw me the keys to the dune buggy.  Yeah.  Because, you know, not a pot to whiz in or a window to throw it out of.  Right.  But we had to have, you know, horses and dune buggies.  Although we moved every six months because, you know, the landlord was banging on the door.  Uh, so he tossed me the keys to the dune buggy and, and, you know, he'd been drinking.  I'd been drinking and just go, ah, have some fun, you know, then I'd get all the girls from  the stable and they were like, you know, 12, 13 years old and they'd pile in and I would 
[00:38:30]  just drive like 60 miles an hour down these riverbeds of, of, uh, Orange County and plowing  into bushes.  I didn't know what I was doing.  Could have killed like a whole carload of kids.  We were constantly shooting guns.  It was just the most dangerous situation for children to be placed in.  Hence.  Ever.  The greatest dad of all time.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  The greatest dad of all time.  It was an adventure.  The, uh, the, the, the biggest thing we did all year was our yearly trips out to the  Mojave desert where we would just go out there and ride dune buggies and shoot big weaponry  and shoot anything that moved until one thing that moved was, of course, I've told that  story before young Charlie Reyes.  Yeah.  Poor Charlie.  Charlie got shot on one of our outings by his father.  His father was loading up a little pistol and, uh, shot him right in the shoulder. 
[00:39:30]  Looked like a heart shot.  Just hold from front of his shirt turned red.  And, uh, oh, were we out in the middle of nowhere?  Had to just load him in a pickup truck and drive him to.  And it was a waterfall of, uh, blood coming out, right?  Yeah.  It looked like a water fountain.  Never saw anyone get shot before or since, but, uh, I was looking right at him and heard  the gun go off and was looking right at little Charlie.  He was nine at the time, by the way.  Nine.  And, and, and when he got shot, he dropped his gun because everyone was armed. 
[00:40:00]  We were just armed to the hilt.  He dropped his gun.  You guys were like a drunk militia.  Looked at his father and just went, oh, and fell to his knees.  And it like came squirting out in a perfect red tube that looked like it was actually red  blood in a tube.  It was perfectly circular and in a perfect arc that just pumped out.  So we were like, oh my God, Charlie's just shot right in the heart. 
[00:40:30]  That's it.  He's going to die any minute.  So all the drunk parents and everybody just grabbed like anything they could and packed  it on the wound and, and, and ice and then threw him in the back of a pickup truck and  had to drive him to, uh, Arizona because that we were closer to Arizona border than, uh,  any city in California.  We were 50 miles in off of a highway.  So we were in the middle of the mountains that were called the old woman mountains.  It was an abandoned silver and turquoise mine.  How cool.  And that's where we used to camp and, you know, drink tequila, shoot guns and ride, drive 
[00:41:00]  doom buggies.  And, uh, that was the last time we ever went out there.  That was kind of ended the Mojave desert trips, but Charlie made it.  He was fine.  Last I heard when I went out to California, when we went out, I visited Capistrano and  asked about everybody and he's fine.  Richard's dead, but he's fine.  Well, yeah, your gay friend's dead.  We'll get into that the other day.  Poor Richard.  All right.  The boy that Anthony was seeing growing up.  He was not. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Well, really fast before we take a break.  Nick in New York.  What's up, Nick?  Hey, yeah.  Sorry enough to distract from Anthony's childhood, but my childhood was taken into Munich by my  parents and they made me tour around Stockholm, which is a concentration camp.  I think it was a death camp and they had big piles of glasses and human hair and it was  just an awful place.  As soon as you got outside the gate, there were fat German people vending balloons and  pretzels and soda and stuff.  It was awful.  Wow.  Right outside the gate? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  I mean...  I guess that's the rule over there.  You know, nothing inside, but right outside the gate, it's fair game.  How were the pretzels shaped, sir?  Were they twisted a little different than a regular pretzel?  No, they were standard pretzels.  Oh, okay.  They weren't actually buying any, but...  So you could see kids walking around with balloons right outside the gate?  You could, in fact, right outside of this place, purchase a balloon.  There were guys selling it there.  Balloons.  All right, Nick.  And there were piles of, you know, teeth and hair and glasses and awful pictures of experiments 
[00:42:30]  done on people inside the gate.  They really have that stuff still?  The teeth and everything?  Uh, piles of hair, piles of glasses, I'm sorry, piles of mattresses made of hair, excuse  me, and piles of eyeglasses.  And where was this?  This was outside of Munich at a place called, I think, called Bacow.  All right.  Because Germany is really sensitive about that whole thing now.  They, uh, I just read something yesterday that banning a lot of video games, um, that  have anything to do with hurting people, which is pretty much every game. 
[00:43:00]  You can't, like, shoot at people.  And they've banned games already that have any images of Nazis or swastikas.  You can't show a swastika in, uh, Germany unless it's for educational purposes or art.  There's some type of art you could get away with, um, using swastikas.  But any other display or use of it is, uh, illegal and you'd be arrested.  Yeah, they kind of have proven they're not too good with the whole, uh, do whatever you  want thing.  No, they're pretty much, look, uh, we can't really control ourselves once we get that ball 
[00:43:30]  rolling.  It's kind of hard to stop it.  We need some tough rules here.  We know how fun it can be.  So it doesn't happen again.  Yeah.  We really get carried away with ourselves.  All right.  Holocaust deniers hold a convention in Iran.  Let's get to that audio.  And everyone's, uh, requesting the Iron Sheik audio.  We'll hear that as well.  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The 2006 Eggnog Challenge will replay on Friday, December 22nd, the day after Opie and  Anthony's appearance on The Tonight Show.  For video of the 2006 Eggnog Challenge, including the infamous Pat Fumunaki's Baby Bird video, 
[00:44:00]  go to opiananthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America on this fine.  Whip them out Wednesday, by the way.  Wait a minute.  It's Wednesday, right?  Yeah, it's Wednesday.  Holy Jesus.  We'll tell you what wow's about in a little bit. 
[00:44:30]  How's that sound?  I swear to you, I thought it was Tuesday.  And every day, every day we got to explain wow to somebody out there.  It's amazing.  I thought at this point people just knew what it was.  No.  Wow.  I am seeing a hell of a lot of wows out there.  Not just stickers also.  Seeing more stickers.  And then I pull up and I see more new stickers.  Used to see the old stickers from the old station we used to work at.  Seeing a lot of new stickers.  And seeing a lot of trucks with the wow just scraped in the dirt, 
[00:45:00]  in the filth on the back of the trucks when I commute.  Well, they're listening to us.  It's really simple.  All right.  We'll get into it.  We do have wow stickers at some of the radio stations we're on.  And then some stations, they don't even bother because they're just lazy.  They want us to do all the heavy lifting for them, which amazes me.  But it's really simple.  The wow stickers that you see out there in the highways, ladies,  that's a sign to you to flash that fine person in that car.  If you feel so inclined.  Right. 
[00:45:30]  We're not expecting every woman that listens to us to flash.  But there are women out there that will do this.  As a matter of fact, we've got the pal talk cameras.  They're all up and lit today.  And the girls, they're flashing us all morning.  All morning long, they just flash us on pal talk.  And it's happening out on the streets as well.  All it is is you need a wow sticker on the back of your car.  Or you need wow written on the dirt in the back of your truck.  Or you need a homemade wow sign if the station's too lazy to print up wow stickers. 
[00:46:00]  And wow stands for whip them out Wednesday or whip them out whenever at this point.  Right.  And there you have it.  Ladies, do your job.  And, of course, the guys know not to harass you or follow you or do any of that stuff.  It's just a quick little, hey, man, this commute sucks.  You got the wow sticker.  I got the boobies.  Here you go.  Makes it a little better.  You clap a little.  You give a little toot-toot and you're on your way.  But it works like a charm.  It's been working for many, many years.  Got a little story when you go home.  Yeah, absolutely.  Jimmy's pretty much enraged. 
[00:46:30]  What else is new?  We can't really ignore the fact that Jimmy is out of his mind.  It's everything that you hate about dealing with people who are not, who are on the business side of it.  It's amazing.  First of all, I was talking to Anthony during the break.  Yeah.  And I was talking about my laptop, which I just got.  And I was complaining because I've had it for a week and it's been crashing.  It's been a nightmare.  Let's just say it's not a Mac.  No, it's not, actually.  Right.  It's a PC. 
[00:47:00]  And I even said it wasn't a Mac yesterday because I know that we talk about Mac all the time.  And I had mentioned it one time that they gave me a laptop, but it had nothing to do with it.  It was not Mac.  My Mac is actually working very well.  This was something that was enraging me because it wasn't working.  It was brand new and it wasn't working.  So I called them and they were giving me bad, whatever.  So I was going to take it and bring it in and take the financial loss and break it with a baseball bat on the radio.  I was so angry.  I wanted to bite it.  If my teeth wouldn't have come out, I would have bitten the laptop. 
[00:47:30]  And you got to let everyone know you're threatening this company.  You said, look, not only will I smash your product on the air, I'm going to tell you what the product was and all that.  I told them, and I would never slander a company.  I would tell the truth about what it was.  This is exactly what happened.  And this is why I'm doing it.  Right.  So I told them that and I meant it.  And they did exactly what part of the service plan was they had a guy come replace the hard drive.  Everything's okay now.  Fine.  They did the right thing.  As soon as I got a supervisor on the phone, once you get a supervisor, oh, yeah, we'll take care of that.  They put the tech guy on who knew what he was doing. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  They're kind of happy to make a problem go away when you get the right people.  Yes.  So I'm telling Anthony, I'm like, yeah, they came to the house and they replaced the hard drive.  It's working good.  And they would have got a good batting.  Yeah.  And I wasn't asking for anything that wasn't do me.  They sold me a product that wasn't â€“ there was something wrong with the hard drive.  Yeah.  And so Tom's there and he overhears it.  And he goes, oh, no, you couldn't have done that.  We do a lot of business with them.  So he goes, that's your personal life.  Yeah.  That's what I â€“ that's what I talk about is my personal life. 
[00:48:30]  I'm not Seinfeld.  I don't just do observational things about on-off switches.  What's with these computers?  Yeah.  What?  What?  What?  That's not what I do.  And he was saying that you can't allow that because we do a lot of business with them.  They don't mind â€“ it's funny how they don't mind your personal life coming into it if you're praising a product that does business with the company.  Yeah.  I've never once heard say, hey, look, stop saying good things about that product.  That's your personal life.  Yeah.  So, I mean, he said, look, I admit it's about the money with that.  I know it's about the money.  But, you know, don't tell me I can't bash a product if they screw me. 
[00:49:00]  I liked your take on it because you said if they would put out a good product and take care of it, if there was a problem initially, then there wouldn't be an issue.  Well, the reality is you got your problem taken care of because you did a lot of â€“  Absolutely.  You did a lot of threatening.  A lot of threats going on.  I'm on a huge radio show and I will bring the product in and smash it.  And break it.  And tell the whole world how bad your company is.  Or how bad my experience is. 
[00:49:30]  Exactly.  Exactly.  Oh, I use this show.  I'm like Al-Qaeda.  I terrorize with threats that I am going to go on the air and just bash the crap out of products if I don't get my way when I'm on the phone.  And this is â€“ and by the way, if people who aren't creative don't â€“ this is the part they don't understand is that people like hearing stuff like that because every person out there gets screwed.  You get stuck to you by these â€“ any major company.  Yeah.  They stick it to you.  They don't care.  You could threaten to cancel or send it back. 
[00:50:00]  They could care less because you can't hurt them.  Yeah, because you're one person.  They don't care.  But if you have a radio show and you can influence thousands of people, then it might affect them.  And it kind of makes them feel good that one of their pals on the air and they're getting to hear a story of a company maybe that have screwed them over getting the old screw.  Yeah, but I didn't want anything for free.  All I wanted was the product to work the way it was supposed to work.  That was it.  And that's all I wanted.  And then he goes, well, I'm like, well, maybe I would have done it at XM. 
[00:50:30]  I didn't know what to say because I was talking to Anthony.  I wasn't â€“ whatever.  And he's like, well, maybe they'd let you do that over there.  Yeah, they would because I had a problem with the company and I blasted them on the air and they were somebody who did business with XM.  And I got a call from Elo.  He's like, look, I'm not going to tell you what to do creatively.  This is the situation with them.  And they put me in touch with somebody who righted the wrong because, again, it was a major company and I was â€“ you're one of you doing that disgusting customer service.  You're dealing with a bunch of people that don't care about you. 
[00:51:00]  They care less whether you cancel or not.  And that's why, by the way, people pick up rifles and start shooting people.  It's not to do with your wife cheating on you.  It's because the effing phone company once again puts you through on that stupid voicemail tree and you can't get to the right person.  That's why people murder each other with rifles.  Yeah.  Does that sound right?  Absolutely.  I remember having my problem with one of my car doors.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  The great car door debacle where I couldn't get a car door. 
[00:51:30]  But my car door got dented in a parking lot and it was a brand new car.  And I went through all the channels to try to get this car door and was told by the company that this car door is unavailable right now.  Sorry.  So I just went on and laid into the company and I wound up getting results.  I shouldn't do that.  Millions of dollars worth of business with that company.  Well, you know what that wound up getting?  It got me on the phone with the head guy in Detroit that handles parts for the company. 
[00:52:00]  And he himself personally shipped a door to the place that I was doing the body work on my vehicle.  That's what happens.  You all right, Jimmy?  I'm just irritated.  Oh, of course you are.  It's almost like if you're going out of your way to hurt a company for no reason, but when a company wrongs you, when it's legitimate, to have to hear that garbage. 
[00:52:30]  Like, first of all, they're not going to stop doing millions of dollars worth of business with CBS because I badmouth them.  Yeah.  They're not.  What are they going to do?  Yeah, millions.  They're not going to do it.  Maybe they'll be forced to remedy a problem and treat people better because you never know who you're talking to and what the customer can do back to you in that sense.  But I was supposed to just roll over and take it.  I should just bite the pillow because CBS does a lot.  Come on.  Stop.  Stop it.  You know what Tom had the gall to do to me? 
[00:53:00]  I wanted to short a stock and then bash it on the air to devalue it and make money.  And Tom actually told me there was some kind of legal issue.  Hey, let's get into this audio.  So the Holocaust deniers hold a convention in Iran to say it just never happened.  Never happened.  And we sent David Duke over there.  He was our ambassador.  Our envoy. 
[00:53:30]  Our ambassador.  Our goodwill ambassador.  There was a French professor there.  Duke.  The French who just, yeah.  What a hell of a crew over there.  Oh, just picked up Mel Gibson showed up.  Yeah, Mel Gibson played a game.  Bobby Fisher was the entertainment, right?  All right.  Here we go.  Imagine a fact-finding conference to determine if the Holocaust ever happened.  Well, it's occurring in Iran and it has many people here very disturbed.  The conference in Iran drew a collection of crackpots and the world's Holocaust deniers, 
[00:54:00]  including David Duke of Ku Klux Klan fame.  The way of blinding the world to the crimes that really is true of the Holocaust has been committed  against the Palestinian people.  Presiding Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, who with a straight face has called the conference  to examine whether the Holocaust of 6 million Jews really happened.  Like he says, with a straight face.  Right.  Like, what is it?  A joke?  And the...  Hold on two seconds.  The Holocaust never happened. 
[00:54:30]  I can't even say it.  Would it be better if he did it with a wry smirk?  Stupid.  With a straight face.  He's truly insane.  The president of Iran is a problem.  Oh, yeah.  He's a big-time problem.  And, well, part of the biggest problem is he's charismatic.  He's well-spoken.  And...  Snappy dresser.  Snappy dresser.  And journalists like him.  Because he looks Western. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  He's as radical in the Middle East as you can get.  He wants Israel exterminated.  He could be dressed exactly like bin Laden.  And people would look at him and go, oh, my God, this guy's a lunatic.  It's, of course, Iran is a crazy, fanatical state.  But he dresses in a suit and tie.  He comes to the United Nations and addresses the U.N.  Well-spoken.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a real human being.  So Americans look and go, wow, he's like a real person, not like those savages. 
[00:55:30]  And it's very dangerous.  It's one of the hostage takers in 79.  Right.  In 79, this was one of the guys that held the American hostages.  And now he's running the country.  Not only that, he comes to, you know, Manhattan and eats in all our restaurants.  Oh, yeah.  He's like, all's forgiven about that silly hostage crisis we had back in the day.  He's got a smile on his face.  There's the guy.  He's right there.  Yeah.  Grab him. 
[00:56:00]  Grab him.  Come on.  He's a criminal.  He really is.  He's got a guy kidnapped.  Instead, he's probably in some sushi joint.  Yeah.  Enjoying himself.  Enjoying a little sushi, maybe.  Trying some different foods while he's in Manhattan.  Unbelievable.  Here's more audio.  The French professor.  We need proof.  We need proof, huh?  You have to provide us with proofs.  Proofs.  And real testimonies.  This French professor says, prove it. 
[00:56:30]  You have to provide proof.  Well, he's an idiot.  I mean, there are a million books on the Holocaust.  You know, this guy who has suffered himself because I guess his mom was in the concentration camp.  So is he.  He's a survivor.  Oh, this guy is?  Yeah, as a child.  Yeah.  He can't even hold back the laughter, how ridiculous it is.  And he was personally affected by the thing.  And this Frenchman.  Right.  Who, you know.  I should have set that part of the clip up.  The guy who says he's an idiot, he was part of the Holocaust. 
[00:57:00]  His mom was part of the Holocaust.  Of course, the French needs proof.  The French would need proof because their backs were facing the entire situation as they ran.  Ran away.  Ran away.  Run away.  Run away.  They couldn't see it because they were too busy fetching tea for the Nazis.  Yeah.  As they trampled all over their arts and their country.  Giving them a baguette.  A big baguette.  A croissant for you, Mr. Wissler.  Croissant.  Here we go.  Back to that.  Right away.  Actually, three Nazis took over France. 
[00:57:30]  It wasn't even the whole German army.  It was three guys that just knocked.  And they went, all right, all right.  You got it.  You got it.  We got hungry.  We'll call everybody.  We'll get everyone together for you.  What do you need to eat?  Well, he's an idiot.  I mean, there are a million books on the Holocaust.  And there are a million picture books.  And I can show him a picture of my mom in a prison dress.  80-year-old Edward Lessing's mother had been shipped off to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during the war.  He hid out from the Nazis in Holland. 
[00:58:00]  They both survived.  He insists Israel will, too, no matter what the propaganda.  These people will disappear in the dust of history, as far as I'm concerned.  I don't think it is worthwhile to pay too much attention to it.  I really don't think so.  Unfortunately, they will have some response, I'm sure, to the world.  Lessing says Iran's president had better figure out that it's Israel which is the superpower in the Middle East.  Superpower.  Yeah.  That whole thing was like a weird little publicity stunt on Iran's part. 
[00:58:30]  It's almost like if you wanted to debate something that happened 150 years ago, before there was video and cameras,  and when there's not people who are alive now that did actually witness it.  Right.  For example, slavery.  Well, I mean, yeah.  Slavery is only written about technically.  It's all hand-me-down stories.  I mean, you know it happened, but to prove it, you can't.  There's no video.  Like video, right? 
[00:59:00]  There's a few still pictures.  A few still pictures.  You know, maybe a couple of stories.  It could have been a wonderful show, though.  I don't know.  A few of those etched plates.  Yeah, right?  But just the fact that they think all these people made this up and kind of came up with  the same story.  They captured records from the Nazis that, you know, talk about it.  Well, it's happened with the 9-11 conspiracy crap.  And we have all the proof we need, but these dummies out there are making a good living trying  to say that, you know, it didn't happen the way we all saw it. 
[00:59:30]  Anything that has anything to do with the Jews being a certain way, people want to say  it's a conspiracy.  Whether it's 9-11, they're going to somehow blame on the Jews, or whether it's the Holocaust,  they're going to say the Jews are lying, you're just going to win.  It's all about Voss.  Unbelievable.  Rich Voss is the problem with Jews everywhere.  If they would just get rid of Voss, or announce that he's not one of them.  People would love the Jews.  Iran would embrace the Jews, but they look at Voss and they're like, if this is what you  are, we can't deal with you.  Because you're dumb and you have little hands. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, speaking of Iran, do we have, what's his name there?  The Iron Sheik?  Iron Sheik.  One of our favorite things to play.  We interviewed the Iron Sheik from the old WWF days of wrestling, and I don't even know  what he said on our show.  He's a hoot.  And then we walked him down the hall and said, hey, could you please do an ID for the Opie  and Anthony show?  Yeah.  And this is what we got out of him.  This is the Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation three-time champion, All-American AAU champion. 
[01:00:30]  A pleasure for me today, Anthony and Opie, bring me here to New York, to I say hello to  all my wrestling fans.  And everybody know, I'm the real Middle Eastern man, come to the greatest wrestling country  and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion, I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially 
[01:01:00]  All-American and also my Iranian friend, Khidmat Hamish and Wendagani, Iranian Aziz, Salam  Azbukaram, Hamid, Dunia, Arun Sheik, Khosrow, Wazir, Mishnistan.  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to I talk today.  Opie and Anthony, and pleasure for me always.  Well, that was clear.  Every time you play that, a sleeper cell wakes up.  Yeah.  Yeah, a sleeper cell just goes, okay.  What?  Oh, it's time? 
[01:01:30]  You heard it.  There was the signal.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Hey, when we get back.  Opie and Anthony.  The funniest part of that, and I've analyzed that many, many times.  By the way, we have like hours of that.  He went on for like 20 minutes or something.  He would not shut up.  That's just their little taste.  He just went on and on and on.  People told him that it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Right.  And he would say my name first to Anthony and Opion. 
[01:02:00]  He thought your name was Opion.  Right.  Opion Anthony.  So he would say my name first, and then your name was Opion.  Yeah.  You want to hear another track?  What a dolt.  Here, play another cut.  Curly, chewed idiot.  This is Aaron Sheik, the World Wrestling Federation champion.  Pleasure for me.  To the Anthony, and Opion, and pleasure to have come here.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, and hello to all people, to the wrestling,  and pleasure to have be here. 
[01:02:30]  Pleasure a lot to be here, where the Holocaust never happened, the Jew lie all the time,  never happened.  Pleasure for me.  The best part, the reason we have so many cuts of this, we go, all right, Iron, Mr. Sheik,  if you will, just say, this is the Iron Sheik, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  That's all we want him to do.  Just, that's it, please.  And we got this gold, so we go, all right, Iron Sheik, you ready?  Just say, I'm the Iron Sheik, and you're listening to Opie and Anthony, and this is 
[01:03:00]  what we got.  I just want to say, hello, this is the Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation champion,  Olympic champion, AAU champion, and to you people, very, very be happy to talk, to listen  to the Opie and Anthony, I want to say again, God bless you all my wrestling fans, and have  a good day.  So we almost got it done there.  Almost.  Almost.  All right.  The guy wouldn't shut up.  No.  All right, when we get back, it's MacBook Karaoke. 
[01:03:30]  We got three great finalists today.  Yeah, I heard a couple.  Take our maze, pretty good.  That's a tough one.  And Pamela, if you're listening, yes, you're a finalist today with I Saw the Sign.  And again, she sounds like the last two-girl entrance from Monday and Tuesday.  Is that that Ace of Base song?  Yeah.  Oh.  Even sung perfectly, that song stinks.  Hey, we'll go to break with another Iron Sheik idea. 
[01:04:00]  Here it is.  I just want to say, pleasure for Iron Sheik to come from all this country in the world,  Tehran, Iran, to the New York City, to I do the interview with the opium and Anthony, and  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons, so I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him. 
[01:04:30]  He was suffocated under two tons of melons.  But mine are still juicy and perky.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the opium and Anthony show.  It's the opium and Anthony show.  I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm out.  What happened?  I'm out.  Oh, boy.  What's the matter?  Hi, welcome back to the opium and Anthony show. 
[01:05:00]  That's going to be a tough sell over there.  Oh, boy.  Oh, wow.  Did your mic peter out?  We had a little bit of a dilemma.  Mine sounds a little bassier than it did.  Oh, this is the worst day for this to happen.  They're filming us for CES.  No, that's all right, because that's not going to come over here.  All right.  And that's yours.  You're not going to stand up over there.  All right, go over there. 
[01:05:30]  Everyone's switching positions.  Yeah, but now I have to lean in like this.  Oh, we're so mad.  Lean in.  Go ahead.  Lean in.  It almost looks like, hey, hey, I'm just kind of leaning here.  All right, we're back with the opium and Anthony show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  We're going to prove we're professional broadcasters.  Yeah.  Here's the deal.  We do five and a half hours of radio a day, okay?  When we go to commercial, we don't even get to take a break during commercials.  And I know people are going to go, oh, stop complaining, guys.  But here's the reality of it. 
[01:06:00]  We need to eat or we're going to pass out.  So I try to eat breakfast during the commercial breaks.  But during the commercial breaks, we have to do about two or three live reads per break for the New York audience.  So I'm panicking.  I'm trying to eat egg whites and a healthy breakfast in between reads and stuff.  I'm basically swallowing food just before I go back on the air.  So in a panic, because we also have a film crew here filming something for CES.  We're going to be doing a little thing out there in Vegas for Les Moonves, the big boss. 
[01:06:30]  Oh.  Summer Electronics Show.  So we're not supposed to talk about that?  Well, now I screwed that up.  Oh, what the hell, man?  Anyway, I'm trying to eat.  I knocked the water over, and it went all over the board.  And my mic is officially out.  So now I'm using Jimmy's mic.  My mic doesn't even turn off anymore.  It won't turn off?  No.  Oh, that'll be good.  When it finally does pop back on, we'll probably say something really bad.  Yeah, so I have to lean way over here to do the radio show. 
[01:07:00]  Now Jimmy's over there.  Now we're, like, in completely different positions.  I don't like this view.  I have to look at Eric.  I normally can just look at open.  Now I have to look beyond you and see E-Rock just zoning out back there.  But the water went in the board.  It's not good.  Tim's becoming impatient with Eric.  Eric's doing something, and Tim just put up his hands like,  All right, fat girl, I'm doing it.  Same button, but go back to your mic.  Go back to my mic, but same button.  Oh, same button.  But same button. 
[01:07:30]  All right, I like that.  Tim, I'm on the fly.  That is a faux fix, is what that's called.  Maybe I can go back a little while?  You can't ever go home again.  He's rewiring the studio as we speak.  You're officially a guest today.  Oh, boy.  I should just start doing, like, material awkwardly.  Funny you talk about the Middle East.  You're like, you're talking about 10 minutes.  You're like an awful comedian trying to get their dumb jokes in.  Oh, what a mess.  I'm sorry, I took this to Bob and Tom.  Get your plugs in. 
[01:08:00]  I haven't seen you do something like that, by the way.  In a long time?  In years.  Years since you've spilled something on the board.  You don't have much room up there.  I mean, as much as I love to see you spill things, there's not a lot of room to operate there.  I hate my space.  I hate my space in this.  It is, by the way, a taboo in Radioland to have any type of beverage by the board.  Yeah.  Usually, PDs and GMs get very angry at that.  I remember one time we were at AAF.  And I think it was Rocco. 
[01:08:30]  It was one of those giant 7-Eleven huge things of Coke.  And it fell onto the board.  And you heard him, like, curse.  And then he's trying to explain what just happened as he slowly starts, like, just sounding like,  Oh, my God.  I just spilled something into the board.  And it's not even work.  Wait a minute.  No.  No, this doesn't work.  It's not work.  It's not work. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Thank God it was water.  You slowly fade away into oblivion.  If it was soda or orange juice or something like that, the sugar would really, really be a problem.  Well, let's not disparage soda or orange juice.  They may do business with CBS.  I don't have problems with any type of beverages.  But I panicked.  I panicked because I got, like, how many inches?  Like, two and a half inches in front of me to balance an egg white omelet and water.  So then when I turned, I elbowed the water right into the board and on all our microphones. 
[01:09:30]  You have all your little CDs laid out there and a notebook.  There's not a lot of room.  So you've got to get yourself, like, a little table area.  Tim.  Have something with a doyling.  We need more space here eventually.  Like, at least another, like, four to five inches.  I don't know how you could get that done.  But we need area in front of me here.  How about on your corner?  There's a little corner to your left there.  Maybe you could put it in the corner.  And maybe they could extend the corner.  You could have, like, a little eating area.  Perhaps a flower.  That would be nice.  Something fragrant.  And by the way, before they tell us, you know, you're not allowed to eat in the studio, shut up. 
[01:10:00]  What are we supposed to eat?  Maybe get us astronaut food that we could suck down quickly in between making more money for this company with the live reads.  Yeah, well, let some astronaut food buy a live read.  You can bet we'll be eating it.  All right.  Hey, MacBook Karaoke.  We're giving away a fine MacBook.  I don't even know where that went because there's water on everything.  Okay.  Yeah, we're giving away the MacBooks all week here.  Yes.  Doing MacBook Karaoke.  We got three more fine finalists today. 
[01:10:30]  Jimmy, is that going to work, though?  I don't know.  Tim?  Pop me up, Tim.  There it is.  That's good?  Which one?  I hear, Jimmy.  Say it again.  Hi.  Yeah, but I had three mics on.  Okay, you're now over here, I guess.  I can't hear anything, though.  Huh?  Oh, now I can.  All right, you're good?  Wait, I don't know.  That mic sounds a little bit better.  Oh.  What do I know?  That is really low.  I got you cranked.  Okay.  Yeah, that'll work.  Just kind of swallow the microphone.  All right.  All right.  Let's give away another MacBook.  We've been doing MacBook Karaoke. 
[01:11:00]  We got three finalists once again today, Anthony.  The first one is this guy, Richard Fabrizio.  Uh-huh.  He sings Take On Me.  We heard a version of Take On Me yesterday, didn't we?  Did we?  I think so.  This is not an easy song to sing.  Right.  Wasn't it the girl that was singing yesterday?  Yes.  Girls naturally have the higher voice.  Yes.  So now, a guy trying to sing this is very hard.  It's got a very high falsetto part in it. 
[01:11:30]  It's kind of a weird, a lot of range in it.  Mm-hmm.  And it's just a lame song.  Well, yesterday, we had Miriam doing it.  Listen to this.  Miriam.  Again.  Give away.  I don't know what I'm saying.  Say it anyway.  I'll be coming home for you, love. 
[01:12:00]  Take on me.  Take me on.  You.  I'll be fine in a day or two.  Take on me.  All right.  Well, that was Miriam trying to take on me.  Well, today we got...  That's actually what Paris Hilton sounds like without any computer work.  Oh, absolutely. 
[01:12:30]  Absolutely.  By the way, a fake photo in the paper today.  Paris knows how to get publicity.  We said it earlier.  Yeah.  We were talking about this during the commercial, too.  We're on page three because it's a slow news day.  They got Paris Hilton here in New York, and they blew up the photo to show some white substance  in her nostril.  Yep.  I guess they're basically saying she was doing coke at lunch.  Yeah.  No, that's Paris getting the media again.  She knows how to do it.  She has invented all this stuff.  She's smart.  I invented it. 
[01:13:00]  She's smarter than people are giving her credit for.  She invented the, you know, getting out of a car without panties on.  Yep.  You know, she's famous for being what?  She's sexy, man.  She's famous for being sexy.  Being photographed.  But she knows how to work the paparazzi and the media, and this new shot with her with  possibly some coke in her nostril.  Yeah.  She put some white powder there, and the paparazzi and the photographers, you know, fell for it.  And guess what? 
[01:13:30]  We're talking about her again today, and it's on page three of the post, a huge picture.  Yep.  I would bet a lot of money it's not coke.  It's Paris just effing with the photographers again.  All right.  Well, here's Richard doing his version of Take On Me, trying to win a MacBook today.  Take On Me, trying to win a MacBook, take on me, take on me, take on me, take on me, take on me, take on me. 
[01:14:00]  And I'll be gone.  Oh, my God.  Frankenfurter. 
[01:14:30]  He's tracking.  Enough of that.  What do you think?  He almost pulls it off.  That actually, I don't know if that is considered actual karaoke, to tell you the truth.  He was able to sing over that last note.  If he's doing it, that sounds like a live band or something.  Yeah.  I don't think that really matters.  I'm being a little technical.  All right.  Well, let's listen to Tracy.  I've got enough of that song.  What do they have, three songs to choose from on the website?  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah.  You can sing Take On Me, this other one, or Monk Chance. 
[01:15:00]  Here's Tracy McDonald doing Right Here Waiting.  So glad we picked songs that everyone could feel for.  How about the classics?  How about songs we've all heard in karaoke bars?  Right Here Waiting is Richard Marks, because someone told me.  I took for granted all the times that I thought would last somehow. 
[01:15:30]  I've never heard anyone sing to a hum before.  It's just a droning buzz.  I taste the tears.  Not by an outlet.  But I can get near you now.  Oh, can't you see it, baby?  He's singing a cappella.  You've got me going crazy.  Wherever you go, whatever you do, I will be right here waiting for you. 
[01:16:00]  That's what he sings to his girlfriend before he stabs her.  Whatever it takes.  Stalker.  Oh, how my heart breaks.  He's singing this as he digs a shallow grave in the woods somewhere.  Yeah.  How does something, you know, of course, the song is pretty lame, but a song that's supposed  to be romantic and stuff turn into something that sounds like a homicidal stalker.  I'll be right here waiting for you. 
[01:16:30]  When you get out of work, I'll be in the bushes with a knife.  He has night vision goggles and there's a moth on his shoulder.  Look, I got my haters out there.  I understand that.  But Justin from Chicago, you're just an ass.  Oh, Justin.  He writes, Opie, could you be any more out of touch with your audience?  Why don't you just eat your breakfast before you come to work like the rest of the world  and stop crying about it?  First of all, I said, first of all, I made it a point that I'm not crying about it. 
[01:17:00]  I'm just relating to the audience what happened and why my mic doesn't work and Anthony's  mic was about to go out as well because I spilled water all over the freaking...  What?  Oh, you hear that?  That was you?  Yeah.  My mic is starting to crap out.  I told you.  Yeah.  So we had to talk about the reason why the water spilled all over the board.  My button is blinking.  Oh, no.  Wait, you weren't kidding?  Wait a minute.  Am I there?  Yeah, now you're back. 
[01:17:30]  The button was blinking.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  That board's screwed.  They're grabbing a wireless mic for you.  Oh, no.  Now Anthony's out.  I'm out.  I got to tap out.  Wait, I can...  You earned that.  I can hold the button down and you can...  I'm done.  Oh, no.  No, you're out.  No, that's wire seepage.  See, Justin, do you understand now why we had to bring this to everyone's attention?  Wait, wait.  Where are you now?  Over here?  I don't know.  Oh, there we go.  Oh, that might sound great. 
[01:18:00]  Tim, can you please put your hand up to Eric again in a disgusted fashion?  Oh, wow, I feel like I just...  Take on me.  I feel like I could sing.  This is like...  I got a boom mic like I'm in a band.  You just need a piano in front of you.  Sing us a song, you're the piano man.  What a mess.  That guy...  What?  What happened?  We used the same mic but where you are.  All right.  Yeah.  Look at Tim.  Man, Tim, you are earning your keep today. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  All right.  We're plugging Anthony back in so he feels more comfortable.  Oh, but I can't use Anthony's button anymore.  He's going to now be over here?  He's connecting wires.  Wait a minute.  There you go.  Oh, am I back?  You're back.  I don't sound as loud as I did, though.  It sounds a little weird.  I'll crank you up a little bit.  Yeah.  Oh, that's better.  That guy did sing Take on Me like he was alone in a room crying.  Breathing like Chuck Liddell.  But getting back, Opie, you couldn't have done more damage if you flew the Enola Gay over  that board and dropped its payload. 
[01:19:00]  What were you drinking?  Molasses?  But getting back to Justin in Chicago, I wasn't bitching and we were explaining why all the  mics are now going out.  Yeah.  And the reality is, yes, we do have to attempt to eat during commercial breaks.  And he goes, why don't you eat like the rest of America before you go to work?  We do.  It's called dinner.  Justin.  Get it?  It's early.  This is what I want you to do.  Set your alarm clock for the middle of the night.  Yeah, at 2 in the morning.  Wake up and go make some omelets.  And eat at 2 in the morning. 
[01:19:30]  And go make some omelets.  Who wants to eat at 4 in the effing morning?  By the way, I've just been handed a song list of what people have to choose from.  Yeah.  I want to thank you for going back to 1986 and grabbing this.  Here's the songs these people have to choose from.  Kiss Forever.  Oh.  Bonnie Tyler, Total Eclipse of the Heart.  I'd like to hear a girl croon that one.  Yeah.  Hey, I'm kind of a big Kiss fan forever.  Never heard of it, dude.  There's a million Kiss songs you can sing before that one. 
[01:20:00]  Why that one?  How about Hard Luck Woman?  All right.  Kajagoogoo, Too Shy.  Now I would like to hear that one done.  Yeah.  As a guy who's doing squat thrusts over a fire plug.  Def Leppard, Love Bites, Queensryche, Queensryche, Silent Lucidity.  Journey, Separate Ways, Counting Crows, Mr. Jones.  Yeah.  The Richard Marks song we just heard right here.  Waiting for you, Extreme, More Than Words.  White Snake, Is This Love? 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  You should be forced to have a rat tail if you sing that.  Foreigner, I want to know.  Foreigner stinks.  No offense if they do business with CBS.  I want to know what love is.  Aha, take on me.  Four and I Blondes, What's Up, and Bon Jovi.  Where are the basic karaoke songs?  I don't know.  What was the reason for not being able to use the basic karaoke songs?  Does anyone know?  God, we stink at doing everything.  We stink at everything.  That should be our promo.  We can't even do a karaoke contest right. 
[01:21:00]  Why?  I think it's going quite well.  Swimmingly.  Oh, because we're making something out of it.  I like it.  I'm sure if Frank Stallone sat on that couch, we'd make something out of it.  But we don't want Frank Stallone on our stupid couch.  We want Sly Stallone.  I think the thinking was to get songs that would be difficult to sing, but that people  like.  Like, Aha.  I have no problem with the song selection.  All right. 
[01:21:30]  Thanks.  I think they are difficult songs to sing.  And most people know them except for that Kiss song.  Oh, my God.  And they're guilty pleasures, some of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Total eclipse of the heart.  Yeah.  If you and your life partner are going to Plato's Retreat, I mean, you might as well enjoy  it.  Hey, Fast Freddy.  Let's retreat.  Fast Freddy, who I love for the most part, he's a faithful listener from Jamaica Station.  Today I learned Opie is the only man in America that gets up at 4.30 to start the day.  That's not what I'm getting at either.  I know a lot of people start their day early, but most people do not attempt to eat as soon 
[01:22:00]  as they wake up at 4, 4.30 in the morning.  That's what I'm getting at.  Those people that get up as early as we do here on the Opie and Anthony show, they too  wait about an hour, hour and a half before they attempt to eat.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the...  I don't eat until we're on the air.  And I get up at 3 o'clock.  I do two and a half hours of calisthenics.  Do not.  Anyone who does calisthenics when they wake up should be shot.  Jack LaLanne is the last person to do a calisthenic. 
[01:22:30]  Do some deep knee bends and some toe touches.  You know what I do?  It's on your mouth.  I wake up my girlfriend and we throw the medicine ball back and forth at 3.30 in the  morning.  Sitting on the bed back to back.  Yeah.  Passing it around.  Yeah.  To get ready for another day of radio.  The eye of the tiger playing in the background.  Right.  And then she gets to go back to bed.  You know what I...  And then I do jumping jacks.  I touch my girlfriend's bare bottom when she's sleeping over and she's wearing her awful  pajama top and I just grope her until she wakes up and then I leave.  It's a goodbye slash assault. 
[01:23:00]  That is terrible.  I actually make that noise.  I'm just grabbing her ass.  All right.  There's nothing better than a good hiney rub on your girl before you leave the house  though.  Like the way Caligula rubbed that girl's stomach before he brutalized her husband.  And you just kind of rub the stomach and you just pat it like she's a chuck of meat.  Well, isn't she?  Of course she is.  All right.  Here we go.  The last finalist.  God, all our mics sound different. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, I know.  And I'm going to get a talking to.  Oh, whatever, dude.  Perhaps a bit more.  I'm not listening.  Well, go back to XM and do the whole show from there.  Give me a space in front of me where we could play some stuff.  And, you know, we're going to continue eating during the breaks.  Either that or my blood sugar level is going to drop and I'll pass out.  Which could make for good radio.  I hope he wants it to be like the scene in Goodfellas.  When he walks in for work, he wants somebody to come with a table and a tablecloth, place  it down, put a little lamp and plug it in and have Frankie Valli sing to him. 
[01:24:00]  We can't get Frankie Valli.  We can have Steve C. belting out Roses Are Red.  Steve Carr will sing Pendulum to you.  That's what we should do.  Make that sissy stand on an apple crate and sing as we walk in in the morning.  Serenade us, stupid.  At least my mic works, idiot.  Third finalist for the MacBook, it's Pamela Hartman singing I Saw the Sign.  Oh, boy. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  I've got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm your person.  I am dreaming of you.  I don't bother.  You're not the one for me.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  Is enough enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding. 
[01:25:00]  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up.  To get into the lights where you belong.  The place where you belong.  It sounds like she's being threatened to sing this song.  Like there's someone with a gun to her head.  Yeah, she's singing this for a taweed in Jihad.  Hands and knees with a rifle pointed at her.  Congratulations to Pamela Hartman.  You have won the MacBook. 
[01:25:30]  Fantastic job.  I like Pamela's version of I Saw the Sign.  We're not voting today.  I give it to Pamela.  It's a soin.  I want that burned, and I want to be able to put it on my iPod.  Yes.  I saw the soin.  I saw the soin.  Soin.  What's a soin?  Soin.  At the soin post up ahead, your next stop, the Twi Luiz Zon.  Yes, MacBook Karaoke.  Congratulations to Pamela.  Definitely another play. 
[01:26:00]  You just won the new MacBook.  Sleek and sexy, and it has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities.  Head to the Apple Store or Apple.com to check it out.  Once again, Pamela Hartman wins today's MacBook.  Here she is again.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  It opened up my eyes. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, she's devoid of talent.  But she's got a MacBook now.  She certainly does.  Breathing into it.  Oh, she's breathing.  She can't sing.  Yeah.  She's over-pronouncing with that affected voice.  Oh.  I can't remember.  That was her song.  I saw the sign.  Oh.  How good is the MacBook for smashing into someone's face? 
[01:27:00]  God, what is she going to use the MacBook for?  Creative possibilities.  What?  See, she's a perfect candidate.  What?  Because she's someone who will never be able to sing anywhere but alone in front of a computer.  Right.  So she might as well enjoy it.  I want to see, when she gets the MacBook, I want her to do that song again on her MacBook.  And I want to hear that version.  But I want her to put her face by the keyboard so we can slam the monitor down on her head.  She's terrible. 
[01:27:30]  You've got to keep that.  Yeah.  We need a new copy.  We need a new copy.  Saw the swines.  Hi.  It started getting good to her.  Yeah, she was really working.  She was a little nervous.  Hi.  And then she kind of cleared her throat mentally and was like, what?  She loosened up.  Oh, was she atrocious?  Oh.  She probably sings happy birthday every year at someone's party.  She's the first one to volunteer to belt it out.  Everybody wants to cut her throat, but they're too polite.  Oh, this just in.  We have a fourth finalist for the MacBook. 
[01:28:00]  Before we give it to Pamela.  Oh, good.  We have to hear this last finalist for today.  How did that happen?  Here it is.  Why don't you just play that there, E-Rock?  Don't.  Not on your goddamn radio.  I never play radio, Mom.  Yeah.  The fourth finalist for the MacBook.  Here it is.  Let's take a listen.  I'm in Cameroon waiting for a train, and I'm feeling nearly as fitted as my jeans.  What?  Oh. 
[01:28:30]  Bobby thumped diesel down just before it rains.  He rode us all the way to New Orleans.  This is my drunk mind.  My poon, my poon.  This is my mother drunk off her ass.  I thought it was Janis Joplin now.  I'm singing so far, Bobby sang the blues.  She had the voice of an angel.  When she a whopper slurping time, I was holding Bobby's hand to mine. 
[01:29:00]  We sang every song that driver knew.  Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  Nothing.  Don't.  Steve from Bajo sounds, yeah, she sounds like an angel.  The angel of death.  Tell Stephen that's why I mentioned it.  Yes.  Yes.  Of course.  Good, our Lord, when he sang to me. 
[01:29:30]  You know, feeling good was good enough for me.  Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.  Is this why Ann's father fled to California?  Donkey, donkey, coal mines to the California sun.  Hey, Bobby, share the secrets of my soul.  Through all kinds of weather.  I believe she had a few spritzers. 
[01:30:00]  Through everything that we've done.  Hey, Bobby, baby, get me from the coast.  The coast.  One day up near Salinas, Lord, let him slip away.  He's looking for that home, and I hope he finds it.  But I'd trade all up for a single yesterday to be holding Bobby's body next to mine. 
[01:30:30]  People are wishing that my father would have hit her with that plate of spaghetti instead  of the wall when they had the big argument.  Nothing left to lose.  Nothing.  That's all that.  Feeling good was good enough, Lord.  Did you tase my mother?  I sure did, Anthony.  Tom Chiasano saying, please don't disparage Drano, because they're a sponsor, even though 
[01:31:00]  your mother gargled with it before she sang.  Hey, man, that's not even a good one.  Mercedes-Benz is better.  Well, the funny part was, as she's singing, she's putting all the inflection in the wrong  places, and the verses are not coming the way they're supposed to.  What do you think?  She was hammered.  One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away.  Slip away, looking for that.  I hope he finds it.  Instead of being in verses, it's like Nicholson wrote, all work and no play makes Jack a dull 
[01:31:30]  boy.  She's just kind of one word, and 30, and then two.  Oh, my father burnt rubber to Route 80.  That's how fast he got out of New York.  Hey, Tim's here with his awesome set of tools.  He's got to fix this place, so he could fix it.  We're going to step aside for a little bit, but can we play Mercedes-Benz going into break?  More of Ant's mom on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz? 
[01:32:00]  My friends all drive Porsche.  I must make a name out with my heart.  All my life with no help from my friends.  Shut your ass.  Oh, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?  Shoot him now.  Shoot him now.  Not on your goddamn radio.  Oh, shut up.  This is retarded. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, stop it.  Get me a mouth.  What the hell is going on?  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Lord.  Shut up, stupid.  Oh, Lord.  God damn, is that funny.  Not on your goddamn radio.  Oh, what a bitch. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my ass.  Son of a bitch.  No.  Opie and Anthony will be appearing on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Jim Norton will be tagging along for no good reason other than to get a free trip to Los Angeles.  That's Opie and Anthony on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno Thursday, December 21st.  Check local listings for showtimes.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[01:33:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  The board has been ripped up.  Tim is in here with hair dryers.  I never saw how that was done.  Wait, I don't know which mic you are anymore, Jimmy.  There's a bunch of...  Oh, wait, that's you. 
[01:34:00]  And talk.  Hi.  Talk again.  Hi.  All right, we're good.  We're good.  A bunch of...  The board is a big...  There's a big board.  I didn't realize it was a lot of pieces.  I thought it was one huge piece.  No, it's very modular.  No, there's a huge hole in the board now.  So, they were in here with, like, hair dryers and stuff.  What a nightmare.  Trying to fix it.  All right.  I like the fact that you took charge and spilled a little liquid.  Show them who's boss.  Absolutely.  Take a nice... 
[01:34:30]  Show them who's boss.  Take a milkshake next time and dump it in there.  That's what I do next time.  Yeah, it's The Opie and Anthony Show.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  All right.  How you doing over there, Anthony?  Good.  Trying to get some cameras up.  You know how it is.  Yeah, I blew that, too.  We have a camera crew in here for something.  I don't know what for, but they're doing something with Pal Talk. 
[01:35:00]  So, Anthony's getting some of the windows up on a big screen so they can film it nice.  Right?  And, you know, of course, it's one of the days where all of the real, you know, sexy, provocative  girls aren't on.  They got, you know, pretty girls on and stuff, but I want to see some action.  Could somebody flash just for a second, please?  No, no, no.  This is a corporate video they're making, Jimmy. 
[01:35:30]  We, you know, we don't want to piss corporate off again.  These aren't the flashing girls.  Oh, no.  Of Pal Talk.  We're not their favorite people today.  Between your rants, me spilling water into the...  I'm the golden child.  You always are.  No one's mad at...  Gumdrops.  No one's mad at me.  You're a goody two-chus.  I need to be loved.  I don't think there's one person mad at Anthony ever.  Oh, yes, there is.  Yeah?  Yes.  Under protest. 
[01:36:00]  No, not even her.  She's not even mad in the end.  Better not be mad.  Oh, she'll be mad at the end.  Yeah?  Once that runs out.  That's it.  Tick, tock, tick, tock.  All right.  I think I'm going to start writing the countdown on it.  I had been writing, like...  We're talking about, of course, your divorce and the...  Yeah, that I got to pay, you know...  And the settlement checks.  Because I'm a guy, and that's what you do.  Right.  So I'm thinking, instead of what I usually write in the little memo section is, you know,  how many I've written and what I'm up to, 
[01:36:30]  I think with this next one, I'm going to start the countdown.  Instead of showing how many I've done, how many are left.  Like a payment book.  And it's like, ah, how many payments left, you know?  Eight left.  Oh, seven left.  Hope you're saving.  Something like that.  And then I think somebody will be mad at me.  Finally.  Let's say hi to Keith and Glenrock.  Keith, what's up? 
[01:37:00]  Guys, I want to know if Hapahulkface is going to be around the next couple of days,  so I can pay to take a photo with him.  Yeah, we talked to Hapahulkface yesterday morning, and he's just terrific.  Jimmy met him for the first time yesterday.  What do you think?  He's a looker.  I never met this guy.  He's a homeless guy who's got a tumor in half his face.  He's just an abomination.  It has completely messed up the right side of his face to the point his ear is at least  six inches lower than where it's supposed to be with a huge hole in the middle of it 
[01:37:30]  where he can stick his finger right through it.  His entire finger fits in.  He can pretty much scratch his brain, it looks like.  And then his whole chin is just completely drooped down like he has a tennis ball in it.  Hey, there you go.  So we're walking over to XM, and Danny, what are you doing, Ed?  This is a corporate video.  Wow, there's two lesbians in Santa hats.  Hey, try that on for size.  Hey, go show the bosses that.  That'll be a hit.  Two girls in, well, they're just wearing Santa hats. 
[01:38:00]  That's about it.  They're wearing little Santa hats.  They're blondes.  And one of the girls looks like she's looking for her present.  Right.  She's being a good girl.  Well, she's not going to get coal in her stocking.  No.  Well, if she spins that gift basket around, she might.  There's a gift in a pretty box, and she's looking for it.  She sure puts the pal in pal talk.  That's right.  That's actually lap talk.  Hey, why are the video guys turning off their cameras, Anthony? 
[01:38:30]  I don't think there's much talking being done in this video.  Pal slurp.  And it's in the Christmas spirit.  That's right.  One girl is wearing that.  They're both wearing the Christmas hats, and they were wearing little Christmas thongs.  Uh-huh.  At least they both wore a minute ago.  Now it seems one is kind of, well.  Well.  Merry Christmas, everybody.  Merry Christmas.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho.  I'm glad none of the listeners embarrassed us by putting up tranny videos or other things 
[01:39:00]  like that.  You know, Jim, how awful would it be if I went to a camera and just saw horrific tranny video,  especially today when they're filming it for corporate.  Right.  That would be awful.  Nobody wants that type of disgusting nonsense.  No.  Keep it clean out there in pal talk land, please.  This is professional.  You know, we're professionals here.  That's right.  Why are they trying to take a shot from way over there?  Like a long shot.  A long shot.  They're like Zapruder. 
[01:39:30]  They're behind a sign right now.  What's going on?  And that looks like the head wound.  She had her thong on, and she went behind the Stemmons freeway sign.  Ooh, looks like someone found their present.  Aw, Merry Christmas.  And the one girl seems happy with what she got for Christmas.  And then right next to that is some guy cleaning his kitchen.  It's just an amazing medium, isn't it? 
[01:40:00]  It sure is, Anthony.  All walks of life.  It sure is.  All walks of life.  That's a really, really good scene.  Some guy cleaning the stink.  Oh, the line.  And it would have been really funny.  You could say it without being.  Some guy cleaning the stink.  Some guy cleaning the stink and some girl cleaning the stink.  Damn it.  That would have been a damn gem.  I ruined it.  I was so eager to get it out.  Stop.  It happened. 
[01:40:30]  You ruined it, and I don't think Al would allow that.  Al.  I might feel a little too lazy for the audience.  I'm going to get through, Al.  How'd you like to mow my lawn?  Well, you established what you were talking about, because back in April, you were discussing  saying, shut up.  Shut up.  We get it.  Shut up.  We get it, Al.  You've got to keep it fair for the bosses.  I hope you got some good post software.  You got some?  You got After Effects?  You could just pixelate that.  Yeah.  Well, now they're filming it for their own private use, obviously. 
[01:41:00]  That is fantastic.  This is for the, well, the gag reel.  Could be two ways to say that.  God, that is sexy, man.  That's a really good scene.  Oh, boy.  More equipment coming into the studio to try to fix the board as we broadcast to the entire  country.  Why don't they just lower Travis in there with a rag?  Yeah, no kidding.  Travis could fit in here.  Little fawn body.  So, anyway, half a Hulk face.  Yes, we want to get photo ops with half a Hulk face.  Oh, hey, hey, hey. 
[01:41:30]  Danny did it over at XM.  Danny did one of the funniest bits ever.  We walked over with half a Hulk face.  The reason I add an F to that word is because I'm still looking at the video.  I saw half of something else fade, so.  That is so distracting.  Oh, my God.  She's just not stopping.  It's really good.  Yeah, well.  Are there any cameras I should be looking at for, you know, I mean, you know, good stuff.  Not anything like tranny porno or anything like that. 
[01:42:00]  Nothing that would embarrass this show.  Right.  That's right, because we've got to get this corporate video done today.  Jimmy, half a Hulk face.  Yes.  What did we do yesterday, and what do we want to do, I think, Friday?  We're going to go for photo ops outside the station?  Yeah, we walked over with him, and, you know, I had never met him, so it was kind of fun  listening to his story, because I was in L.A. when he was first introduced to the show.  So then someone came up with the idea, let's have him take photos with Polaroids with people  and charge them five bucks and then give him the money.  So Danny goes out with a bullhorn and begins asking people to take their photo with old 
[01:42:30]  cancer face for five dollars, and he was insulting everybody.  I listened to the replay last night, and it was hilarious.  He was really ballsy.  It was really, really funny.  And I mean, he told people, like, a woman's like, no, no, thank you, and he would go,  get cancer, like, right to her.  Danny was great yesterday.  What an ass.  Just abusing people.  Three inches from their heads with a bullhorn.  And a poor half of Hulk face is screaming, I am not an animal.  I am not an animal. 
[01:43:00]  I am not an animal.  I am not an animal.  It's so hard to say that when you look like that and have people empathize.  What's that, sir?  What, Keith?  What studio are we going to have to come to?  Wow, the phones are now answering themselves, by the way.  I didn't even know anything there.  You didn't push a button?  Keith just showed up.  Hey, Keith, what's up?  I forgot why I called, like, an hour ago.  You started going off on the peltop.  Oh, you want to know if you can get your photo with half a Hulk face?  Yeah, I just want to know where do I got to go, the free FM or XM?  Either way, the two studios are, what, a block away from each other. 
[01:43:30]  Stand on 57th and 6th, and we'll just get to you.  Yeah, we'll get to you.  But we're thinking half a Hulk face would be a great shot for your MySpace page,  because he's such a freak.  He really is a freak.  That's a good idea.  I should have done that.  What a dope I am.  Well, we're going to do it, I think, Friday, but you've got to pay for your photo.  So, you like $5.  $5.  $5.  $5.  $5.  All right.  Thank you, Keith.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Yeah, he did a really good job. 
[01:44:00]  I'm almost, it's almost mind-boggling how Catherine Hepburn, who's running the board over here,  just took a, thank God, closed bottle of water, and apparently thought it was a loon and swatched  it, and it fell all over the board with the lid on.  Wow.  I love it.  I was lost picking blueberries.  Knock it off.  Jesus, dude.  Maybe we should have the water over there.  Yeah, maybe that.  Or just drink something. 
[01:44:30]  Drink powdered milk.  Maybe there's something in the water I didn't realize, because I'm a little loopy.  All right.  Hey, news teases.  We started this the other day.  Scary news teases.  We did the ATM one, right?  Where you could use any type of car to get into the ATM area?  Yeah.  The ATM.  Even your driver's license.  Even your driver's license.  We learned that.  Really?  Yeah, so that's how criminals are getting in there with you.  Maybe criminals that wouldn't have that particular bank card, and you go in to get money, they 
[01:45:00]  could use their own licenses to unlock that electronic door.  Oh, my God.  We got a brood and tattooed on Pal Talk.  Yeah.  He was displaying a lovely weapon.  Where's that one?  Oh, my God.  This guy looks like he really would hurt somebody.  What do you got there?  That's a lovely piece of equipment.  I hope that's not loaded.  I see a magazine in there. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, my God.  This guy is all tatted up with a tank top on.  Wow.  He's a shaved head.  Yeah.  He's coming back from a big conference in Iran.  Looks like some kind of Russian weapon tree.  I don't know what the heck he's got there.  What is it, Ant?  Do you know?  Do you got a clue?  It's too dark in there to really get a good look.  That guy's a problem.  Yeah.  Definitely a problem.  Now he's pointing it at the camera.  Boy, is that scary.  He looks like the guy that raped Edward Norton in American History X.  I think he is. 
[01:46:00]  Jeez, dude.  Could he turn a light on?  You have to use night vision goggles around your house.  Oh, he's screaming.  Would you?  Would you?  About a size 14.  You know how you know he's frightening?  He has tattoos on the back.  You know how you'll usually get tattoos like you want to hide from the sleeve up?  Yeah.  He has them on the back of his hand.  Like on the back of his hand where you can't hide it unless you're...  And on knuckles too?  Yeah.  You're the real deal if you get tattoos on your hands or your neck.  Anywhere you can't hide with it.  Because now you're not hiding from anybody from corporate America. 
[01:46:30]  With a job interview suit.  Right, right, right.  You can't hide it with a job interview suit.  You can't go in there with gloves on.  I'm going to get a teardrop tattooed on my eye.  Like on my cheek.  Oh, that's good.  That'll get you work.  Yeah.  I don't know what that means.  I think it means you're sad for the world's woes.  You're sad for the starving Africans.  That's what that means.  Hey, Randy.  What's up?  What's up, Randy?  Hey.  Yeah, I just wanted to know about the karaoke in the morning.  Okay.  What would you like to know, Rand?  Go.  How do you get on it? 
[01:47:00]  Well, I think it's too late to get into the MacBook karaoke contest.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Well, hold on.  There might be a way to do it.  Can you sing?  A little bit.  What do you sing, honestly?  Just like I can sing in the car.  Well, how about this?  Sing something.  Sing something, and if it's good, we will find a way to get you in.  Yeah, let's go.  I wish you were singing in the car of that South Carolina couple.  All right, sing.  I couldn't spit it out. 
[01:47:30]  I can't talk today.  I can't sing.  Goodbye, then.  What'd she say?  I can't.  Yeah, she can't sing.  Well, how would she call?  I don't think I can go her.  Andrea, what's up?  What's up, you guys?  Hey.  I just was upset they didn't include the Janis Joplin song for the karaoke picks to enter  this.  Well, that was my mom, and of course, she wouldn't be eligible to win being a family of an employee. 
[01:48:00]  Hey, this is something that's illegal is giving her a matchbook.  This is Cake Girl.  Hi, Andrea.  Hi.  This chick is out of her gourd.  We love Andrea.  She's the worst cook ever.  She brought over, she tries to bake food, and everything she brings, it looks like a mangler  experiment.  I did it because Obie smashed Andrew's cake, so I wanted to make up for it.  Yeah, so she brought a cake that I would have rather eaten the cake that Obie stepped  on.  Let's put it this way. 
[01:48:30]  Really.  If I jumped on Andrea's cake, I would have sprained an ankle.  All right, let's start there.  It's not good, Andrea.  I know, but I can sing much better than I cook.  And who knows what kind of pills you decide to throw into the batter for the hell of it.  Oh, no, I save them for myself.  We don't trust you.  You can sing?  Yeah.  Well, let's hear you sing.  Okay.  Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waiting for a train, and I was feeling nearly as faded as my 
[01:49:00]  gene.  When Bobby thumbed the diesel down, just before it rained.  And drove us all the way to New Orleans.  Well, I pulled my harpoon with my dirty red bandana.  She's improvising.  I think soft while Bobby sang a blue sound.  Wind-tilled rapper, schlepping time, I was holding Bobby's hand in mine.  We sing every song that driver knew. 
[01:49:30]  Well, freedom's just another word.  Stop whining.  For nothing left to lose.  Stop it.  And nothing, ain't nothing.  Stop.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I'm feeling good.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Hello?  Stop it.  Keep saying it.  Stop whining.  What?  Keep going.  I'm feeling good.  From the Kentucky coal mine.  Stop whining.  I can't follow it.  What?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Quiet.  I can't follow it, sir.  Stop it.  You probably share the secrets of my soul.  Stop whining.  All kinds of weather. 
[01:50:00]  Everything that we don't.  My Bobby and baby kept me from the cold.  Marijuana is the bomb.  One day up near Salinas Road.  I let him talk.  He went on the phone and I hope he finds it.  We're going to train all night tomorrow.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  You're going to feel okay.  Next to mine.  Well, now, freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.  I don't care. 
[01:50:30]  Who cares?  That's all I'm loving at me.  Oh, yeah.  I'm feeling good with no way.  Shut your goddamn ass.  When it's saying the blues.  I'm feeling good with no way.  Shut your goddamn ass.  I'm feeling good enough for me.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Please, just shut up.  Yeah?  What happened, Andrew?  I shut up.  It wasn't bad.  It was good.  Why'd you stop? 
[01:51:00]  Because you said to stop.  No, no, we did not.  Continue.  I can assure you.  Shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Do you want to kiss me, or?  Why not?  Why not?  You shut up.  You shut up.  You shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[01:51:30]  I bring nothing to the table.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  A damn rich horse.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is that my...  Can't you dig that? 
[01:52:00]  I'd do the chooker.  Wow.  Wow, that was...  You're good.  You should have sent in a tape.  I did.  I did.  I sent in total clips of the heart.  Oh, really?  Did you really?  Yeah.  Do we have that somewhere?  Yeah, but maybe you're a finalist tomorrow or Friday.  Who knows?  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Huh?  What?  We should make sure that we have that total eclipse of the heart for some more.  I'm sure it's a lovely rendition.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's good when I'm not, you know, half asleep. 
[01:52:30]  What?  It's good when I'm not asleep.  It's pretty early to sing.  Oh, that must have been it.  Oh, wow.  So, I'll talk to you guys later.  Yeah, please.  Bye.  Bye, Andrea.  Bye.  It's good.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I gotta go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line. 
[01:53:00]  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, what a mess. 
[01:53:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Tim's still working on the board.  It's just a mess.  There's hair dryers and tools all over the place.  If you're just tuning in, I spilled water all over the board.  And my mic went out.  Then Anthony's mic went out.  And then Jimmy's mic went out.  The trifecta.  But Tim running around like crazy.  Rewiring the whole place on the fly.  As we attempt to entertain America. 
[01:54:00]  Alright.  News teases, Anthony.  News teases.  Love the news teases.  Scary news teases.  Can't tell.  There we go.  Why'd you just uh-oh, Hawk?  What, Hawk?  I just uh-ohed.  Why are you uh-ohing?  I thought his went out too.  I was going to go get Tim.  Yeah, it didn't sound like I was on for a second.  But I am.  Yeah, you're just a lot lower in the mix.  Yeah.  How he has it wired right now.  It's okay. 
[01:54:30]  And they're checking out, uh...  They're checking out Tim on PalTalk.  That's the beauty of the PalTalk cameras.  They're watching him work during the commercial breaks.  Scary news teases.  It's good that Tim does a little wiring.  His hands like Fred Flintstone.  I'm really...  Could you pick a less delicate-handed individual to do that?  I have smaller and more dexterous toes than he has fingers.  He's got big, meaty hands.  He's trying to get into these small crevices on the board.  He's got to be packing.  You think Tim's packing? 
[01:55:00]  All girth.  Just a massive like...  He's like, no, three by seven.  Three by seven.  All right.  Let's get a couple scary news teases on before we get out of here.  It's a way of life.  We love these things everywhere.  Any city, you watch the news and they try to scare you.  Yeah.  They, you know, toys that can kill your kids.  We got one of those.  They won't tell you what it is.  Oh, boy.  A little bit, a little wacky.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  The water went all the way over there, I guess, huh?  Water will seek its own level. 
[01:55:30]  Why do I feel if I talk louder, it'll fix itself?  There.  I'll talk louder.  There.  It'll push the water out of the electronics.  Yeah.  Oh, there we go.  I'm back.  You're back?  Yeah.  All right.  For the time being.  That must have shaken the water off of it.  Let me just shake this whole thing.  Just bounce around a little bit.  Don't touch it.  Don't even look at it.  Yeah.  Any town, you'll see the news that'll scare you. 
[01:56:00]  Your kids, your car, they'll warn you about a certain vehicle that you might drive could  be deadly.  That's right.  And then you go, wait, I got to go to the store.  Just can't you blurt out the vehicle?  And if it's mine, I'll watch the story later.  If not, screw yourself.  Have we made it perfectly clear that this is a complete cluster F today?  Yeah, but it's fun.  Corporate came in to make a corporate video, and we start popping PalTalk cameras on a  huge screen, and it's nothing but hardcore porn going on.  Well, that was fun. 
[01:56:30]  And then they wanted to film us on the air, but we're rewired now, so we're not in the  normal positions we're usually in.  There's a big hole in the board, so that shot's going to look awful.  Tom's running in and out, panicking, trying to figure out if he should go get hair dryers.  I'm surprised he doesn't have one in his office.  All right, yeah, right?  All right, here we go.  So, yeah, the scary news teases.  They're there, obviously, to make you watch the news longer.  We all know that by now, right?  Right.  They get away with murder. 
[01:57:00]  Here's the next scary news tease from somewhere in the country.  Criminals with the key to your house, a real estate concern at 10.  A real estate concern.  Prisoners?  What did they say?  I'm guessing people who are involved in real estate.  Oh, good one.  No, no, it's just a little intuition pops up when I hear real estate.  I'm like, I bet you that's got something to do with property.  Yeah.  And you give them the keys to your house so they can show it, and some of them probably  have criminal records.  It's just drivel. 
[01:57:30]  That's what it sounds like.  That's all it is, you think?  Yeah, I'm thinking so.  Or like in the movie Crash, they're assuming the key makers are making an extra key for  themselves.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You think they're making an extra key for themselves, or they're just criminals that  happen to have real estate licenses?  Well, if they're making an extra key for themselves, it's the same thing.  I mean, they're still criminals.  It's like the same person as the criminal with your key.  Here's a scary thing, not just a scary news tease, or it could be, all the vehicles now  that have navigation systems.  Right.  When you park in the parking garages here in New York City, or anywhere else, I guess, 
[01:58:00]  you give them your keys.  It's got your house key on there and everything.  For the most part, a lot of people just hand over their keys.  They don't need them while they're parked for an hour or two.  There is a button that just says home on it, and it guides you home.  So anybody can take your keys, push home, drive to your house, have your house keys, open  your door, unload into your own vehicle, by the way, and just take off with some valuables. 
[01:58:30]  A little frightening.  It's like what they used to say, don't have your address on your key chain or something  like that.  Now your car will rat you out pretty much and just drive the crook right to your house.  I have my car key on a separate key.  You do?  I certainly do.  And your nav?  Do you have a home thing for you?  Yeah, I live in a building in New York.  I actually have a street away from where I really live.  See, that's the thing you've got to do.  But people aren't doing this, though.  What?  How do you know? 
[01:59:00]  Could happen.  We'll tell you at 10.  Hey, we have a national radio show.  One person call and say that exact scenario happened.  I'm going to say people are saying this is happening.  People are saying?  Who are these people?  You paranoid freak.  The news just says people are saying, so I'm going to say it.  People are saying there's a huge problem.  You know there's a deeper issue here.  You know Anthony stays up at night just thinking of all these crazy scenarios that might happen.  That's why you've got to put your home.  You don't put it at your home.  See?  You've already figured it out.  You put it like a block and a half away because if you can't get home by then, I'm lost. 
[01:59:30]  I don't know.  A block away.  You've got to do that.  And another thing is the garage door opener.  Right.  If you have a car parked in your driveway, don't have a garage door opener in the vehicle.  And you're actually very smart to put that together.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And then now to blurt it out on the air.  So now a few million people now think what a great idea that is.  Yeah, it is.  A lot of people who have never thought of that before now understand the dynamics of it and will do it.  Just don't rob me because you'll be robbing somebody's house.  My key won't fit and it'll be a block and a half away. 
[02:00:00]  You'll know it's his house if you break into it and you're stealing stuff.  It looks like it's out of a museum from 1945.  Anthony actually has art from World War II that was stolen from people's living rooms.  They'll know it's not me because there's a mezuzah on every other door in my neighborhood.  And my house, we just got it decorated yesterday for Christmas.  And there's huge lights and a big wreath.  And it's like the only thing that screams Catholic in my neighborhood.  There isn't a light to be found.  At night, it's pitch black. 
[02:00:30]  And my house is lit up like Christmas Guinea.  I know.  Dude, you should be the guy because of the neighborhood you live in.  Oh, no.  You should be the guy.  I mean, that really went all out.  See, I didn't go all out.  Where the music goes along with the lights.  Where it's a local tourist attraction.  Yeah.  Where the cars just ride by.  Oh, and just annoy the neighbors.  There's one in every city, one dope that has to, like, you know, be the attention getter. 
[02:01:00]  You should be the attention getter in your neighborhood.  I kept it very subtle for the house, you know.  A few lights up the pathway.  Lights on a tree in the front yard.  And then I have columns.  I have columns on the sides of my door that go up and they're wrapped with, like, Christmas tree type branch things and lights.  Who did this for you, by the way?  You call a company and they come and they have, like, a cherry picker, big rig thing that works on trees. 
[02:01:30]  There's no way you do this to yourself.  And they do it all, yeah, a bunch of Mexicans come over and do it.  You're going to put a Christ on your roof and have him just, like, turn and wave and just go, thanks for nothing, neighborhood.  Thanks for nothing.  You killed me.  You're the people that killed me.  Oh, my God.  That would really be awful.  Actually, last night I was having a conversation with a certain Frenchman, a chef, kind of Frenchie. 
[02:02:00]  And it was suggested that perhaps because I got a giant wreath.  When they pulled this thing out of the truck, I started laughing.  And it's not on the door.  It's over the door because I had, like, a big window that's over the main doorway.  And the wreath is hung there.  This thing has got to be about eight feet across.  And I was thinking how funny it would look to arrange red lights in the middle to light up in a certain pattern at night.  You wouldn't see it in the daytime.  But when you plug it in, bam, there it is. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, it's the symbol of peace.  I would never do it.  Oh, my God.  Many cultures use this as a symbol for peace.  That's right.  The American Indian used it.  And as a matter of fact, many Asian cultures see it as a peaceful emblem of I'll leave the town immediately.  We're getting a look inside his head.  You know that.  No, I would, again.  He stays up at night thinking of these things.  This is one of those things that you think about, but a sane person never does.  You think about the horror it would bring to people, and you never actually go through with it. 
[02:03:00]  Don't be silly now.  All right.  Hey, what's the answer to this dumb thing with the real estate?  I guess criminal records and they got your keys is the obvious answer.  Yeah, it's basically ex-cons becoming real estate agents and then therefore having the key to a potential homeowner's house.  Oh, so they can go back, steal your stuff?  Sounds dangerous.  Oh, Dan, thanks for covering.  You got it.  Thank you, Dan, for that coverage.  You're welcome.  All right.  I've got to do it with the news, you know.  Thank you, Dan. 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  Back to you, Greg.  Well, you can't have scary news teasers without a sex offender's scary news tease.  Scariest things in the news are the sex offenders.  Here we go.  Here's a local daycare center, and here are the locations of six dangerous sex offenders living and working in the area.  Here's a local preschool, and here's where a level three sex offenders working right next door.  I shouldn't be right next to a preschool.  Fox undercover found out it's happening all over the state, and it's completely legal tonight on Fox 25 News at 10. 
[02:04:00]  To calm the drums down in the background.  What the hell is that ominous drumming?  It's not an action picture.  The molester.  He's a regular guy, and then he gets zapped by radiation.  He comes out with a big M on his chest.  Psychic power knows where all the little preschools are.  Able to leave giant cribs in a single bound.  A little creep.  You would think they would have a no-kid-touching zone around the schools. 
[02:04:30]  Well, they're supposed to be.  Like they have no drug zones.  No drug zones.  Yeah.  I guess they're supposed to be, but they can't keep track of these people.  That seems to be the problem.  Speaking of sex offenders, I've got to give Shred and Reagan some props.  Yeah?  I saw a video they did on YouTube.  Halloween.  Remember we were talking about how all the sex offenders had a curfew?  Yeah.  On Halloween, they don't want them out with the children.  They weren't allowed out because, you know, kids are trick-or-treating.  So Shred and Reagan on their show, they started knocking on the doors to see if any of the 
[02:05:00]  sex offenders would open their doors on Halloween.  What a great bit, right?  Because you could look them up right on the net.  Right.  Where they live.  Isn't that a great bit?  Knocking on the door.  Did any come to the door?  Not that I saw.  I didn't watch the whole video, but...  Go away.  I can't answer the door.  Mister...  Believe me, it's killing me, but I can't answer it.  I have a bunch of candy apples here I'd love to give to the kids.  But my ankle bracelet will go off and the cops will show up. 
[02:05:30]  Please just go away.  You're killing me.  I'm a princess.  I know you are.  See the candy in your bag.  See how much you want to eat it.  Now you know how I feel.  I have a princess, trust me.  Those creeps.  That's the bit, though.  That is a good bit.  They got to talk to them.  Knock on the doors.  They get through the little letter slot.  You see two, like, livery pedophile lips.  Please just leave. 
[02:06:00]  Can you just go home?  All right.  A mister.  You're the last house on the block.  I'll do anything for some apples.  That's the cigarette bars.  See his creepy eyes look out the letter slot, side to side.  Like that Scooby-Doo opening.  Just the two eyes with the black behind them.  Oh, dear God.  Ghoul.  Just go away.  Meddling prosecutor.  We have anything else to the story there, Danny? 
[02:06:30]  Well, unfortunately, this is one of those ones that comes in from a listener who neglects  to give me the actual story.  Kill him.  It's just an oversight.  Unfortunately, I don't know.  It's just an oversight, obviously.  Oversight?  Yeah, a little oversight.  He's ruined the bit.  All right.  Let's try to get one more in here.  Scary news teases.  Next on Fox 5 News at 10.  Parents, we have a problem.  Got him in the face.  How a toy topping kids' holiday wish list.  Usually they're the same to the TV anyway, not someone else.  Could leave your child in the emergency room. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  I know what that one is, too.  This is my favorite one of all time.  This is the example we always use.  Yeah.  These bastards that do the local news.  Your kid could already have this toy, but you have to wait to whatever, 10 o'clock to  find out.  They could be playing with the toy in the other room.  It sounded like a pistol.  The hell was it?  How great would it be if it was a brand new pistol slash Pez dispenser, and you have  to put the pistol in your mouth and pull the trigger for a Pez candy to fall onto your  tongue?  Parents are worried. 
[02:07:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  I'd love to create that.  Just the worst toys ever.  If I had won a billion dollars, I would create that toy and then just hand it to kids for  free.  Show this to your mother.  What was it there, Danny?  That's actually the Nintendo Wii.  The Wii?  The Wii.  That's an innocent enough game.  Only little kids would buy it.  Anyone else would get something like a PS3 or something.  Well, if you listened to...  Only immature children would play with a Wii. 
[02:08:00]  What's the problem?  Right, Than?  It's a great, great system.  Yeah.  It's just because Than has it.  And if you listen to the Than and Sam show, you'd know that the straps on the Wii controllers  are, well, not faulty, but they're not as strong as they could be.  And when people are swinging their arms around with these Wii controllers, the straps are failing  and just smashing into walls other people, TVs.  That could be dangerous.  There's a website.  It was in the paper today.  People that have broken windows and gotten black eyes because that strap broke as they're 
[02:08:30]  playing the waves.  You're playing that damn Wii controller around.  Yeah, it's actually...  Well, she says it in a tease, but it doesn't really reference the website.  It's actually, We Have a Problem.  What was it?  We Have a Problem.  Yeah, W-I-I.  W-I-I Have a Problem.  So what?  Is it a website or is it a YouTube video?  Because I didn't get to actually check it out, but they have some stills and they show  one girl with a black eye.  They show another window that's just completely broken.  Yeah, I saw that one with the black eye.  Apparently, from what I was reading, the story behind that was like some guy comes home drunk,  sees his wife playing Zelda, decides he's going to help out, and in like a drunken, you 
[02:09:00]  know, flailing session, just swings back and just smashes her as hard as he possibly could.  Oh, that is great.  Isn't that great?  And what's happening?  They're breaking like in half or something?  Or the one controller's flying off?  What game are you doing where you don't have both of them clenched in each hand?  Than, you're a Wii expert.  The Wii Sports Games.  Wii Sports Games.  Where it's like a tennis racket, I think, is when people get really excited. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, so you're like swinging this imaginary tennis racket is what it comes down to.  Isn't it two things that are kind of held together by some kind of nunchuck cord?  Well, that's the nunchuck attachment, yes.  Oh, that's right.  Certain games use that and certain games don't.  The boxing one uses the two.  Uses the two.  So if you just have one, you're just holding one and there's no wire or anything?  But there's a wrist strap.  A wrist strap.  But that apparently has been failing as well.  Or people aren't using them.  Yes.  I gotcha.  Wait, you're actually playing with that where you move your hands around?  Yes.  Oh, here he goes.  Here goes Jimmy. 
[02:10:00]  He doesn't like any gaming.  They're awful.  And this, he would just think is ridiculous.  I've seen the graphics.  It's like a big giant tennis ball.  Very, very cartoony.  You swing your arm and the little character swings.  Oh, just like I'm playing.  Is it?  Yeah.  I want to see where they come out with the full metal jacket one and you're marching into  a bathroom with a shotgun and a t-shirt.  Look, when I sit down in the toilet, the character does it. 
[02:10:30]  Some people enjoy the Wii.  Some people really like the Wii.  What can I tell you?  I like Dan swinging his arms around.  I'm looking at some of the videos.  There's like dents in the ceiling.  A lot of TVs with busted fronts.  Yeah, it's amazing how many of those things have just flown into the front of the TV sets.  A broken window.  Wow, this Wii is actually stuck in the actual TV, the frame of the TV.  Another one with a broken like beer glass.  That's fantastic.  It's stuck in there like Excalibur. 
[02:11:00]  Where can you find these pictures?  Excalibur.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  No, I think this one's working today.  You can go to wedamage.com.  W-I-I damage.  Thank you, We Rock.  I figured I'd call you that instead of E-Rock today.  Every time he turns around, he ruins something.  There's another video.  There's another video I saw overnight that I want to turn people on to.  I think it might have been on break.com.  I'm going there a lot lately because they took care of us with that baby bird video.  Yeah.  It's one of these evangelists, TV evangelists. 
[02:11:30]  Did you see it?  With the Benny Hill?  No, not the Benny Hill one.  Who did Let the Bodies...  Drowning Pool?  Yeah.  Let the Bodies Hit the Floor?  And you know how they touch their forehead and the people clap?  Oh, and the people drop?  Yeah.  They heal them.  They put a video together using that music.  Let the Bodies Hit the Floor with the evangelist doing his thing.  It is hilarious.  Hilarious.  Maybe we can link that on opianthony.com later today?  Yeah.  It is really funny. 
[02:12:00]  And some of the moves the evangelists are making where they're just swinging their arms and the people are falling,  perfectly synced up to Let the Bodies Hit the Floor by Drowning Pool.  And No Filter Paul has also put together the video of the lawyer being shot at by his client.  Oh, we asked for this yesterday.  Yes.  Yeah.  And the lawyer's hiding behind a tree that is about four inches wide.  And they're exactly on the opposite side of the tree from each other.  And this guy is shooting at the lawyer.  It's an old video.  It's an old video.  Most of us have seen it.  And he put the Benny Hill music to it. 
[02:12:30]  Like we asked.  And it is hysterical.  It really is.  That music makes anything funny.  Except Benny Hill.  Except for some reason Benny Hill.  You're right.  I don't know where that video is.  Opianthony.com?  Yeah, it's on YouTube somewhere.  And YouTube.  Yeah, eventually it'll be on YouTube.  YouTube, you throw a video up on YouTube and then you've got to wait like two days for it to get into the search.  Yeah, it'll be up on YouTube whether it's up there now or later today or tomorrow, whatever.  All right.  Thank you.  It was a cluster F, but we had a good time today. 
[02:13:00]  Sure did.  Now we just leave this studio in shambles and move over to XM.  The rest of the staff have fun with this tsunami Opie put through the board today.  Look at Tim behind you with a brand new hair dryer to try to dry out the board.  Oh, we just stink.  All right.  We'll see you at XM.  If not, have a great day.  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the Opian Anthony Show. 
[02:13:30]  Coming this Saturday, December 16th from 2 to 6 p.m. Eastern.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opian Anthony Show is going to bring a busload of homeless degenerates to a snooty mall,  maybe one in your town, and give them some money and take them shopping. 
[02:14:00]  Golden buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit  as we partake in another homeless shopping spree this Saturday, December 16th on the Opian Anthony Show.  Bye!  It's the Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Hi.  Hey, these mics work.  Outside Free FM.  We left that place in a complete disaster, by the way.  A wreck. 
[02:14:30]  No, we didn't.  David Lee Roth did.  They had to shut the studio down,  and everybody else now has the broadcast from the little studio down the hall.  Are you kidding?  That's what they said.  Oh, that's great.  They have to fix the studio.  Tom was annoyed.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't understand that that makes good radio in the end.  Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy.  That was fun.  It's kind of windy in New York, a little rain, about 56 degrees.  Also doesn't understand that bashing products is sometimes good. 
[02:15:00]  Also doesn't understand that there is a time where you can say nigger on the air and not be a racist pig.  Also doesn't understand that nudity does have a place in the studio.  Whatever.  Fuck.  And in church.  It's just ridiculous.  In the end, we'll be fine.  It's corporate.  You know.  I think they are.  I understand that.  Yes, my friend.  Mark Morgan is also corporate, and you know.  Yeah.  But Eric's usually drunk.  Yeah.  Hello, Andrew. 
[02:15:30]  Hello, Andrew.  How are you all today?  Who are you yelling at?  No, I was talking to the Bangladeshi guy.  I was talking to him of Mukti Bahni.  When they got the freedom in 1971.  You were talking about...  Indians, they got them the freedom.  Indians got freedom, why?  It's called Mukti Bahni, the army of Mujibur Rahman.  What?  An old-timer, you know, Baba.  Yeah.  And they didn't even serve their own army. 
[02:16:00]  The Indians had to go and liberate them to get them the freedom.  Are you saying that India got who their freedom?  Yes, India got them the freedom.  Got who freedom?  The Bangladeshi.  Oh, Bangladesh.  From East Pakistan.  It was called East Pakistan.  East Pakistan.  And the Indians had to go in and save the day.  India had to go there.  Indira Gandhi was the prime minister.  Gandhi?  Indira Gandhi.  Indira Gandhi.  Indira Gandhi. 
[02:16:30]  Right, I remember her.  Right, sure.  We remember that.  Yeah.  Not Mahatma Gandhi.  Not Mahatma Gandhi.  No, he's the skinny guy.  Yeah.  Skinny like me.  Yeah, with a big light bulb head.  The only thing, I don't have no glasses.  Right.  If not, I would look like Mahatma Gandhi.  But he's just like you.  All he ever did was sit down.  That seems to be what he did.  If I had the glasses, I would look like Mahatma Gandhi.  All right, speak a different language for us.  What kind of language do you want me to speak?  The language of the housed.  Huh?  Anything. 
[02:17:00]  What do you got?  Spanish.  Exactly.  Speak from the Necromonicon.  The what?  Cantonese.  What?  What?  I just heard you a whore.  I'm a whore?  What's that?  What language is that?  That's Cantonese.  It's what?  Cantonese.  Cantonese?  Cantonese.  I love that.  The cooking is fantastic. 
[02:17:30]  What are the languages?  What are the languages?  You speak Indian?  From India?  India?  Okay.  And what else?  You're just an A-hole?  I know what it doesn't mean.  Do you sell toothbrushes here?  Let's get out of here.  Andrew, of course we'll see you soon Saturday.  I know what it doesn't mean.  That's good, Ant. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, those fucking teeth are frightening.  Wow.  I understand the homeless basically are worried about shitting in a place where they're not  being piped.  Exactly.  What's up, bro?  Other priorities, but...  Yeah.  His teeth are exceptionally awful.  Wow.  Fucking Zell wouldn't take one of those out.  It does.  His teeth look like every skull that was piled up in Cambodia.  Wow.  Codename The Cleaner.  Lucy Liu, Sedgwick The Entertainer, and Nicolette Sheridan. 
[02:18:30]  That looks really funny.  That, just the picture on the bus there.  You gotta read the slug line.  In a dirty world, he's our only hope.  Well, you have a black man, an Asian girl, and a white girl, which covers all demos.  I hope that movie makes fucking $8 at the box.  By the way, it's called The Cleaner, Codename The Cleaner, and he's holding a vacuum cleaner.  Ah.  So, yeah, that's comedy.  Codename The Maid.  Codename The...  That's not Codename. 
[02:19:00]  That's birth name.  Maybe we shouldn't make fun of The Cleaner, because they may advertise on CBS Properties.  Oh, true.  Good thinking, Jim.  Good thinking.  Boy, am I not gonna let that one go.  You tried to cross the street, Opie, and the light was red.  Yeah.  And you had to turn back.  I had to look all awkward.  You were gonna be crushed by a big truck.  Oh, these traffic people. 
[02:19:30]  You have a useless job.  You wanted to be a cop, but you're not.  So now you stand in the middle of the road and direct traffic.  Did they realize homeless people do that during blackouts in big cities?  They just stand in the middle of the road and direct traffic?  Ah.  Really isn't skilled labor there.  All I want is to see one traffic person just hit by a fast-moving car. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, it's happened.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing.  They ought to get skinnier people for that job, because many a day, I almost hit them with  my mirrors, because they stand in the middle of the road, and they're big and fat.  Fat gorillas.  Oh.  Hello, miss.  All right.  Don't look at me.  Hey, female Jimmy Carter.  He's the guy.  Awful.  She's shitting. 
[02:20:30]  Miserable day.  I missed the one on, though.  It's nice.  Yeah, but...  I got a new bit.  Did it work, though?  What did you do?  You saw it, right?  You rocked.  What was it?  The one that was annoyed on you?  I got in front of her and just stopped short.  She banged right in the back of me.  Oh, beautiful.  Only she had a strap on.  Ooh.  I was walking one time down the street.  I bent over to tie my shoe, and a guy walked into me, and I told him, he's a cock hit between 
[02:21:00]  my ass cheeks.  He was reading.  I just stopped at the time I was...  And I felt his helmet push softly in between my cheeks quickly.  Oh, shit.  It was horrible.  Was he reading honcho?  No, he wasn't.  Would have been a co-winky dink.  Why do you tell him he's trying to look sexy?  Modest Yahoo have a, what, a holiday CD out, or what?  Did you?  It comes out after Christmas.  It comes out after Christmas? 
[02:21:30]  Modest Yahoo?  I know he's singing some kind of festive song.  Of course he is.  He's getting some airplay on XM.  XM has a Hanukkah channel this year.  Ew.  Do they?  What are they?  How many Hanukkah songs are there?  Really?  Three.  There's got to be.  There's the Lightman, the Menorah one, the Dreidel song.  Oh, but they were proud of that one.  They were proud of that idea.  Dreidel, Dreidel.  A Hanukkah station.  Made it out of clay.  And then some, probably, yeah, that and like an Adam Sandler song.  That's all they got. 
[02:22:00]  Ah, right.  All right, we'll see you upstairs.  We have nothing.  O.B. and Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  All day long. 
[02:22:30]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  And we're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:23:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, all right.  Matt from Texas.  Thank you, Matt.  Off the instant feedback right away. 
[02:24:00]  That evangelist video is on the front page of break.com right now.  Where it's put to the music of drowning pool.  Let the bodies hit the floor.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We really left that place a mess today.  An absolute mess.  Good for us.  There was just too much going on there.  Camera crews setting up lights.  One of the corporate people is trying to get my attention.  Like, is it okay to come in now?  And I'm like, you might as well come in because you're distracting already.  They were taping. 
[02:24:30]  They were taping.  And then the pal talkers were terrific because it was just, they were just showing horrific  stuff.  And we're trying to get that, that nice corporate video together where it's a bunch of people  at their keyboards dressed appropriately.  Yeah.  Instead, there was like two lesbians just going at it, eating each other out, and they were  just wearing Santa hats.  Yeah.  I believe they wanted to show some type of, you know, how we use pal talk to interact  with the audience.  There was a gagging video being played on another cam or whatever. 
[02:25:00]  They were just watching despicable videos.  It was great, man.  I love it.  And they were like, kind of like smiling.  Like, oh, it's the guys being the guys.  But they really were getting annoyed in the end.  Oh, those guys.  Oh, that Opie and Anthony.  Who's getting annoyed?  You know them.  I don't know.  I think the film crew, you know, wanted a...  Whatever.  Whatever.  They got enough.  It gave us great fodder for the show today, man.  Tom was annoyed.  You got Tim with hair dryers. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, well.  Where's the homeless shopping spree this year?  Is it going to be Short Hills Mall?  Did we announce?  Mike.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  So it's going to be at the Short Hills Mall.  Start spreading the word.  We want all you guys to show up between 2 and 6 p.m.  I believe so, yeah.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Thanks.  Bye.  Yeah, get the word out there.  We're going to be at Short Hills Mall.  We want a lot of listeners to show up as the homeless do their shopping this holiday. 
[02:26:00]  By the way, not one phone call earlier this morning about Howard being on Letterman.  Not one.  Not one call.  And I got to say it right off the bat.  At this point, you got to think Howard's bisexual.  It's just my opinion.  You think?  He's got to be bisexual.  At least.  He can't wait to put on some kind of like female outfit.  He just can't wait.  Girl clothes.  He wears girls' clothes.  Have you ever worn anything girly in your life? 
[02:26:30]  Out?  Out and about.  I don't know.  Let's just go.  It was a joke.  We've been on TV enough.  Yeah.  Have you ever had the thought of putting on some kind of girly thing?  No, I never even got that for Halloween.  I never even got the dressing like a girl for Halloween thing that some guys do.  I don't have any ambition to dress like a girl or to dress in any type of...  I like to dress in women's clothing.  Any type of women's clothing.  It just does not work for me. 
[02:27:00]  It's my opinion that he has to be bisexual.  Has to.  At any opportunity.  Or at least he thinks about it.  Because last night on Letterman, he came out...  You know, if you go to a strip club around the holiday season, the strippers will be wearing  what Howard wore last night on Letterman.  Right.  Which is like a long, like, Santa suit.  It's almost like a robe.  But it's like a robe.  It's a lot more female than...  It's a dress.  A female looking than what Santa would actually wear.  And they dance to Santa Baby as they diddle their little clit. 
[02:27:30]  The strippers.  Santa Baby.  Santa Baby.  Diddle diddle.  And just because you wear a woman's clothing once doesn't mean anything, by the way.  Oh, no?  No.  Jimmy?  What?  It doesn't mean anything.  Certainly doesn't.  Right.  Well, it's a little creepy when you got a guy pushing 60 on TV in, like, a Santa suit that  a stripper would wear with nothing underneath it, by the way, except his bare legs. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  How much attention do you need, Howard?  And, by the way, was that supposed to be outrageous?  Yeah, I guess.  Well, back in the day, he wore the dress when he was pushing his buck.  I saw a fucking horse launch a wad of horse come into a woman's mouth on the internet.  Yeah.  I'm not really shocked by a guy wearing a little Santa dress and handing out serious satellite 
[02:28:30]  radios the second he hit the stage, hawking, just hawking his goods.  Hey, can we get Eric Logan on the phone?  Because Howard said some crazy stuff on Letterman last night.  Literally crazy stuff.  He's insane.  He basically said that Sirius went from 600,000 subscribers to 6 million listeners in one  year, and he's responsible for all that.  Yeah, yeah.  That was pretty much it. 
[02:29:00]  That was the gist of it.  I'm starving, Kenny.  600,000 to 6 million.  Do we have that serial in, Howard?  It's just a lie.  It is him lying.  He should be held accountable to the Securities and Exchange Commission for lying about subscriptions  like that.  I would love a smoothie. 
[02:29:30]  Let's have a little fun.  Thank you, Kenny.  And he's lying.  He wore a periwinkle shirt.  That's not...  What?  That wasn't gay.  It was colorful and festive.  Yeah.  Wow.  Let's say hi to Nathan in Connecticut.  Nathan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  It's Jason in Connecticut.  Whatever.  What's your name?  Hey, Jason.  Welcome aboard, Jason.  Go.  Hey, I just want to call and say, Howard should have invented some pants. 
[02:30:00]  It was un-fucking-believable last night.  He doesn't do anything shocking on the radio anymore, so he's going to come out with no  pants on?  It's not shocking.  And then he played.  Oh, my God.  That was the best.  This is the best part.  And, yeah, we have no problem.  See, when we were on Letterman, Howard made believe he didn't see it, but then had his  cronies, you know, talk about our appearance, and Howard's like, oh, really?  We all know.  And they talk about what asses we are.  We all know that Howard saw us on Letterman.  And he's just a lying sack of twat.  So this morning in the office, as our own Sam was editing or getting the audio from the 
[02:30:30]  appearance for Stuff We Can Goof On, we were watching it.  And Dave asked him about Howard TV, which is his subscriber-based e-show.  It's pretty much what it was.  Remember what he used to do on E?  Yeah.  Now it's subscriber-based.  He's got to pay.  And really, no one is subscribing to this.  Which shows two things.  He can't get enough money whatsoever. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  And he doesn't give a shit about his fans.  And he's completely out of touch.  Because this is the worst time to start charging for videos in the history of media.  You could get everything for free online.  You just download those for free, I'm sure, somewhere.  Now, believe me, those are available for free.  I'll be honest with you.  Anthony and I and Jimmy, we have, at this point, probably 10-plus years of video.  We've been filming stuff for over 10 years at this point. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  You know, it really got aggressive as far as videotaping everything when we were at WNEW.  But even at AAF, we had a TV show, and we had a crew coming in all the time, a local TV show.  No big deal.  We understand that.  And we were filming our own stuff as well back then.  We were thinking of putting out a DVD of some of the greatest moments in our careers, because we have video of all this stuff.  But with YouTube and Break.com and Google videos, you know, GorillaMass.net, you could go on and on. 
[02:32:00]  This is the worst time to charge someone to see an outrageous video.  You put out one DVD, it would be all over the net, immediately downloadable to anybody and seen on various video sites.  It just happens.  That's the way it is.  Showing he's completely out of touch, and he's very greedy and doesn't give a shit about his fans.  What you do with your videos at this point is you get them out there on the internet and stuff and allow that to market your show. 
[02:32:30]  Just throw it out there.  And maybe make you a little bigger.  And then in the end, maybe you get paid more because you're a bigger radio show.  That's kind of how you should look at this stuff these days in the new media world, which he has no clue about.  And he's trying to...  The king of old media.  He's trying to make it seem like the video thing.  The king of picture tubes.  Pay-per-view.  His pay-per-view.  The king of reel-to-reel.  Is huge.  There's really no one subscribing.  The king of beta.  Beta Max. 
[02:33:00]  There's nothing going on there.  The king of clunky cell phones.  So he went to show a clip on Dave.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we got.  And he goes, yeah, Dave, I got a clip of my Howard Stern TV.  It used to be on E!  Now it's on pay-per-view.  Here's a clip of this drunk guy.  And...  But didn't he say something like...  He goes, we tape about what happens behind the scenes is what we do.  We have video cameras running all the time.  And we tape behind the scenes. 
[02:33:30]  And this is something that happened when we kept the cameras rolling.  Before you give the big reveal and we'll explain further, let's just play the clip.  All right.  And then the reaction, Ant and I looked at each other like...  Oh, my God.  What?  And we'll explain in a second.  I've got my own TV channel, Howard TV.  I'm on a roll.  What is the Howard TV exactly?  What is Howard TV?  Howard TV is great moments from our radio show.  Uncensored.  We're in the studio.  It's wild.  Now, does this cost people?  Is this free?  Yes, it does.  I took my whole operation underground. 
[02:34:00]  This is the longest I've been above ground.  I'm like a barker.  I took my radio show off of regular radio, went to Sirius.  And then I took my TV show off of the E! Network.  What does this cost us?  Do we want to see this?  They canceled it, by the way.  This is probably about $12 or $13 a month.  And you get a huge menu when you sign on.  It's all on demand.  You can watch whatever you want.  We keep our cameras on even behind the scenes.  So not only do you see the show, but you see what goes on behind the scenes.  Oh, hey.  It goes on further.  Unfortunately, we don't have the whole clip, but they didn't know. 
[02:34:30]  Like Dan once said, you know, these guys aren't expected to read my mind.  But unfortunately, the clip continues.  Like, it's just crazy around the halls.  And we got the cameras rolling down the hallways.  Amazing.  And then he sets up this clip.  About this drunk guy who kind of falls over.  And he falls into a wall.  And he's belligerent in the hallways.  So they show him.  And he made it sound like this is happening at Sirius.  Yeah.  Because they're just crazy over there.  So they show him walking down the hallway. 
[02:35:00]  And you see this little black spiral staircase and some doors on the side of the hallway.  And we all look and go and start laughing because we realize it's the hallway we're looking at.  Yeah, that's the walk we do every morning.  He was playing.  We walked right by the spiral staircase.  They walked right by the office that we were watching this clip from.  He's doing such innovative, new, outrageous audio and video on his radio show that the clip he brought to Letterman was something he had done at CBS. 
[02:35:30]  And, you know, he wasn't even smart enough to block out the K-Rock logo.  No.  Out of all the clips, he's been there a year.  Out of all the clips, he could have brought on Letterman to try to entice people to order his services, various services that are on out there.  He chose a clip from when he was on regular radio.  Right.  What does that tell you? 
[02:36:00]  Right.  That nothing is going on.  Right.  On his stupid fucking TV show or radio show.  There was no buzz about.  Remember when there used to be a buzz about him making appearances on talk shows?  No one cares anymore.  No one cares what this guy does anymore.  It's a funny thing.  Now it's satellite radio.  $12 a month.  That's an unbelievable bargain.  But that's not all.  To get that at $12 a month, that's like stealing.  Are you kidding me? 
[02:36:30]  It's very important television.  I got to say, you know, in this day and age of, you know, of Dancing with the Stars, you got to keep up.  Absolutely.  But, you know.  Does anybody remember laughing?  Oh, God.  Oh, please.  See, Dave was making fun of you, Howard, because he even gets it.  Oh, this stuff's great.  That's pretty much what he was saying.  He was pretty much telling you that, you know, people would not pay $12 an hour for that crap. 
[02:37:00]  It is awful.  And the numbers show that they're not paying $12 a month for that crap.  I said to Beth, I said, you know, every year we sent out a Christmas card with our dog.  And then I found other people were sending Christmas cards with their dog, and I wanted to do something original.  So we took this picture, and I said, well, maybe it's obnoxious to take a picture of yourself and send it out like that.  But my girlfriend convinced me we should send this out.  So we sent it to my mother and father.  And my mother is speaking to my girlfriend, and she says, oh, I got the Christmas card. 
[02:37:30]  And beauty and the beast.  I'm like, what?  You know, I get a hold of my mother, and I say to her, I go, Ma, what's this you said?  She says, beauty and the beast.  I said, oh, yeah?  I said, I don't think it's nice that you called Beth a beast.  But that...  Does anybody remember Lassie? 
[02:38:00]  Okay, terrific.  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  Goddamn rich cunt!  Did you see that jerk? 
[02:38:30]  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  See, because Beth is the beast.  I'm Paul R. Nelson.  Hello.  Shame, shame, shame, shame on you.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana fold.  No! 
[02:39:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, no, not really.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, that's funny.  I'm funny.  Yeah.  Well, that's just terrific.  See, beauty and the beast, boy.  You know, I got to tell you, you know, now that I'm on satellite... 
[02:39:30]  How's that going, by the way?  It is going so great.  We started out with 600,000 listeners in one year.  January will be one year.  We now have almost 6 million, I understand.  Oh, God.  We're growing.  Listen to that complete and utter bullshit.  What the fuck?  We had 600,000.  Now we have just about 6 million. 
[02:40:00]  Well, 5.5 million subscribers in a year?  Wow.  Well, you know, when we started at XM, a little over two years ago, they were around 2 to 2.2 million.  Right.  2.2 million.  And we're going to push, I think, I think, close to 8 by the end of the year.  All right.  So if I do the math, well, we're responsible for 5.8 million subs.  We're bringing in just about 6 million subs we've brought in. 
[02:40:30]  So I'm led to understand, as he said, to cover his ass.  Yeah, so they don't come for him.  Did you hear that?  Listen to the way he said it.  Yeah.  Play it again.  Just listen to how he's got to say something at the end to free himself of certain liability.  And that's the only reason he said that.  Where's Elo, by the way?  Because he'll give you the real numbers.  Listen to what he says after he says this statistic.  We're just dopey shark jocks.  Elo will actually give you the real numbers.  You know, I've got to tell you, you know, now that I'm on satellite. 
[02:41:00]  How's that going, by the way?  It is going so great.  We started out with 600,000 listeners in one year.  January will be one year.  We now have almost 6 million.  I understand.  Oh, my God.  We're growing.  I understand.  Now, wait, wait, wait.  You said .002 of a cent.  And I said .002 of a dollar, Dave.  Hey, so that pissed off John Minnelli so bad. 
[02:41:30]  Maybe I shouldn't be reading this on the air, but what the fuck?  Because he's just blatantly lying.  He's lying to people.  That is a lie about subscriptions.  Can I tell you, like, Minnelli, you know, Howard pretty much got Minnelli fired, which  was just such a dick move, I can't even tell you.  And a blessing.  If you give us an hour, we'll tell you why.  Well, you understand why it's a dick move.  But now he's the program director over at Free FM.  But he hasn't forgotten that Howard basically got him fired because he didn't really like 
[02:42:00]  what John Minnelli was writing about him in the paper.  So Minnelli obviously saw the appearance last night.  And at â€“ these are all the CCs, so hold on a minute.  At 2.30 in the morning, he writes this email to pretty much the world.  He writes it to some guy at SiriusRadio.com, P. Riley.  Uh-huh.  Somebody from a financial institution. 
[02:42:30]  Uh-huh.  Actually, it's the securities â€“  Oh, good.  Yeah, he's not going to let this go.  He also wrote it to Richard Johnson, who writes for the Daily News, I guess.  Post.  The Post is Richard Johnson.  Why don't people look into his bullshit?  Right.  Look into it.  He also wrote this to David Hinckley from the Daily News.  He also wrote this to M. Starr at the New York Post.  He also wrote this to Kathy Bachman. 
[02:43:00]  Maybe someone knows who she is out there.  Sean Hannity, Alan Combs, Kit Carson, Tom Taylor, who's also a media dude.  Paul Bell, Nancy Abramson, Paul Colford, Michael Savage, a talk show host.  Yeah, all â€“  Michael Harrison from Talkers Magazine, Harvey Nagler, Chris Rudy, Curtis Sliwa, Frank Bernacco,  Joel Denver, Johnny Donovan, Lionel, Lynn Samuels.  So who's who of an email? 
[02:43:30]  More talk show â€“ well, what I'm getting at, a lot of people in the media.  Mike Thompson, Perry, Michael Simon, Randy Michaels, who's a bigwig.  Scott Lane, Tom Likus even.  Man, fucking Tom Likus.  And it goes on and on from John Minnelli's subject, such desperation.  Patrick.  So I guess this is to the guy at Sirius.  Yeah.  And then he CC'd all the rest of the people.  Riley is Senior Vice President of Communications at Sirius.  So he went pretty much right to the top, as high as he could go. 
[02:44:00]  So Patrick, are you penny anti-serious people so desperate for subs these days that Howard  Stern has to go on David Letterman, as he did last night, and flat out lie brazenly and  shamelessly?  That's what he did.  From 600,000 to 6 million subscribers in one year?  I thought he misspoke himself when I saw that in a Sirius transcript two weeks ago.  But I guess this is how low he, you, and Melvin have sunk.  Melvin.  You're lucky the media, with the wonderful exceptions noted above, and others who were 
[02:44:30]  blindly CC'd, he writes here, are generally gullible as hell.  Naturally, I'm informing them of the truth, starting with this email, that by my frequently  published estimates, Howard attracted little more than a million subs in two plus years,  and with all that hype, no less.  You'd think this blatantly false public dissemination of information at a time when satellite radio  is under severe attack on Wall Street is something the SEC and NASD would look into. 
[02:45:00]  All the best, John Minelli, formerly with the New York Post.  There you go.  See?  That's a good email.  Just flat out lie.  Call him out.  Get some of these friggin' reporters in there and start looking at these numbers, because  he's lying.  That didn't happen.  He had two years to hype it, and guess what?  He was a bust in the end.  He was a bust.  It just didn't happen.  The stock has moved 22 cents in a year.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[02:45:30]  22 lousy cents in a year.  He was supposed to be the savior.  And now they're backing away.  Mel is giving speeches where he's saying, you know, Sirius isn't all about Howard, and  we have a lot of other content, and he gave a speech to some stockholders and mentioned  a couple of other things before Howard.  Like, we have this and this and this, and Howard Stern, where Howard used to be, like,  the thing he would mention. 
[02:46:00]  Now they're kind of trying to steer clear of putting all their eggs in one basket, if  I may use that term from 1910.  Why would you put all your eggs in a basket when you could drop it?  Well, I put them in a carton.  They're safer there.  Fast-fraid from Jamaica Station.  Minnelli is a bad motherfucker.  Shut your mouth.  Oh, yeah.  Minnelli has, you know, he's not going to let it go.  I wonder, I thought Minnelli got fired because he broke into a funeral home and used their  drapes to make a tie for himself.  Stole a suit off the corpse. 
[02:46:30]  I would love to know who else he CC'd on that email, man.  Oh, he is going for the jugular, and he should.  Someone's got to call him out.  Howard's just a liar, and he has to, like, dress as a Santa girl to get some attention.  $600,000 to $6 million in a year.  It's lying.  It's a blatant, impossible lie.  And Elo's away from his desk, but we'll get him on.  Where is Elo?  To talk about the numbers.  Elo loves talking about the numbers when he's not drinking.  I know.  He's probably soused.  Right now he's laying on his own floor, vomiting into the garbage pail. 
[02:47:00]  Driving drunk, right, Van?  No.  I need one brave employee that works in Washington, because Elo, right now as we speak, is not  in his office.  Run in the office with a cell phone, call the Opie and Anthony show, and tell us what's  in his desk.  Because we know he's got some creepy shit in that desk.  Shit on his desk for us.  Could you do that?  That would be good, too.  Yeah.  That's true.  Yeah, yeah.  Open up his pal talk. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  He'd probably make a pie chart out of it.  He wouldn't even notice it was bad.  He'd just smooth it out and draw a graph into it.  Big presentation.  Well, that Stern ran...  Power crap presentation.  The Stern ran might have been a little boring for some, but we can't get enough of that shit.  This is not going to be boring for anybody.  Stern takes credit for the Kelly Ripa-Clay Aiken incident.  What?  What?  What?  You want to explain the Kelly Ripa-Clay Aiken incident? 
[02:48:00]  Oh, apparently...  Clay was, I guess, filling in for Regis.  Regis pretty much takes 20 weeks off a year now.  Yeah, and Kelly was going off about something, and Clay Aiken reached over to put his hand  over Kelly's mouth.  Right.  You know, in a playful, you know, don't say that kind of way.  Right.  And Kelly said, oh, don't do that.  Don't put your hand on my mouth.  I don't know where it's been.  And, of course, there was all kinds of accusations by Rosie O'Donnell that that was homophobic 
[02:48:30]  because she thought that she was insinuating that perhaps there was a big fat cock in that  hand at some point, just to be subtle, just in case you couldn't figure out what I was  talking about.  Or maybe some ass-fiddling.  Maybe ass-fiddling finger.  Fiddling someone's ass.  I'll bet you Clay likes to rub an asshole, but then he just kind of fiddles with it while  he's doing other things.  Just a little fiddle, fiddle, fiddle.  Yeah.  Poking his finger in and out.  Dip-dap. 
[02:49:00]  Dip-dab.  Dip-dab.  Oh, hold on.  How could he possibly take credit for that?  Cigars and Scotch.  Hey, I have a little time-saving clip for John Minnelli.  Yeah.  When you're trying to send something out, like, to all of the media, under CC, all you have  to type is the Jews.  Oh, so you type CC and then the Jews.  Yeah, they got their-  And it goes to all those people.  Yeah, they got a secret mail server.  They probably do, though.  Just the Jews.  Those Christ killers probably do have a secret mail server. 
[02:49:30]  Wonderful people.  I live amongst them.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wonderful people.  I was just trying to be outrageous without wearing a girl's outfit on.  Crazy.  With your legs.  Did he shave his legs?  What?  You gotta think.  This is my opinion that he's bisexual.  Could be.  He's got a little of the bi in him.  Could be.  That's what I've been led to understand.  You gotta think at this point.  He's way too comfortable dressing up in female clothing.  How did he take credit? 
[02:50:00]  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  That's what I want to hear.  Stern says nobody would have gave it a second thought, but Stern thought it was inappropriate.  It wasn't-  Contentious.  It was weird.  And I'm telling you, no one would have ever given it a second thought, but I got worked  up.  And Beth had Kelly Ripa's phone number, so I call her home phone number.  This is how worked up I am.  I said, hi, this is Howard Stern calling you.  And I know this is your home phone number, but I'm going to tell you something.  I was just watching your show.  I never get to see your show because I'm on the air. 
[02:50:30]  But this fucking asshole, Clay Aiken-  You cursed on her machine?  Yeah, I did.  Her kids could have been in the room.  I don't care.  You're no help either.  I said, let me tell you something.  No, this was her voicemail.  All right.  I said, listen, this guy has no right to put his hand over your mouth.  It's disgraceful.  You don't do that to a woman.  And he's really out of line.  I just wanted you to know when you corrected him, you did the right thing and that's it.  Well, she calls us back and on the voicemail again. 
[02:51:00]  I just want to thank you because I thought it was the strangest thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  She gets all worked up in her voicemail.  She goes on Regis.  Regis returns the next day.  Okay.  And she says, I got a call from Howard Stern and I got a call from people and they were all incensed.  And she starts talking about how disgusting it was that Clay Aiken puts his hand up.  Now, I swear to you, she never would have brought this up.  If you hadn't called.  I hadn't called. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, Robin.  Oh, Robin.  Why don't you at least question him a little bit?  He is just the innovator of everything.  Stop lapping his ass.  Howard has an ass cave.  I never would have.  I said it.  He's into gaping.  And I didn't even have to wear a dress.  Look, I can be shocking without having to wear lingerie.  I said it.  He has an ass cave.  That's what I think.  He actually said that he is, if he didn't say any, I've had it with him. 
[02:52:00]  I just didn't like that he said you don't do that to a woman because that's the first person you should do it to.  Some babbling hole on your left.  Shut up.  Shut him up.  Shut her up, you fairy.  By the way, it's also coming in that yesterday he claimed that he invented the view as well.  Yeah, I read something about that on Whack Bag.  Pretty funny.  He invented the view.  And then they had a whole list of things he said he invented.  Do we have that list?  Is it a real list or a list that people are doing? 
[02:52:30]  It's an actual list.  Things he said he invented.  MTV Unplugged.  No one said he invented that.  He invented people playing on the radio.  Right.  MTV Unplugged.  And we went after this and played examples of other people playing on the radio before they went on Hallow's show.  There were shows dedicated to it.  Can we get that list?  Just an ass.  I want the actual list because our listeners are very funny on the message boards and they have fun with something like that. 
[02:53:00]  But I want the actual list of things he swears he invented.  All right.  Wow.  Overnight ratings in New York.  Letterman.  Randy, what's the overnight ratings on Letterman's appearance?  Howie's good old Letterman appearance did a 2.3 and a 6.  We was into The Tonight Show, both Nightline and Jimmy Kimmel, some old episode of The Simpsons, and Scrubs.  Kind of sad.  You know, I don't even think...  In New York, of course, yeah.  I think we even did better in New York.  You did a 2.6 and a 6. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, you did better in the summer.  So we did better than Howard's appearance.  Yeah.  Yeah, I thought so.  Exactly.  And we haven't had, like, what, 20 years for the country to know who we are.  And you didn't have to wear a dress.  You just let Anthony talk all the time.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  What can I tell you about that?  I mean...  I'm a blah, blah, blah.  I wouldn't mind seeing you in, like, a little something.  I mean, not even...  Just...  You want to wear a little ditty?  You want to wear a little number?  Why don't we do that on Leno?  Me and you, I want to wear a sexy little number. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Crotchless chaps.  And then you could wear a dress with a strap on.  Well, you don't even need one.  You got a cock.  And then just...  Just fuck me right in the ass.  All right.  All right.  On national television.  I want to see...  This is what I want to see open.  I'm just thinking out loud.  All right.  Knee-high white socks.  What?  That might work.  Knee-high white socks.  Uh-huh.  And a little plaid Catholic school girl skirt.  Oh.  With, like, the open buttoned shirt. 
[02:54:30]  Right.  I want you to put on...  Uh-oh.  You're throwing up now.  I want you to put on a little pigtail one.  And, you know, I want you to give yourself a pigtail wig.  I want you to give yourself, with a brown pencil, a little mole.  A little...  Like a Cindy Crawford mole.  A little beauty mark.  A little beauty mark.  Better.  That's a good, uh...  And some pad leather shoes.  That's a good idea.  Jim, come here.  A little closer.  A little...  A little closer. 
[02:55:00]  Your voice gets high when you're tased.  Oh, oh, so Stern takes 100%.  All right.  Here it is.  Here's the rest of the taking credit for Kelly Ripa, Clay Aiken incident.  Beth said to me, do you think we got this whole ball rolling?  I said, that's the problem with my vacation.  I'm sitting at home, and everything makes me mental.  And I call people and get them worked up.  I'm telling you, if I'd never made their call...  And I'm sitting there going, I must be the most interesting guy in the world, because...  Yeah, because I didn't hear anything about...  Holy shit, shut the fuck up, you self-centered cunt. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, fucking shut up.  I must be the most interesting person in the world.  You're a nobody.  You're traded in whatever fucking popularity, whatever waning popularity you had for money.  God bless you.  But fucking face reality, you douche fuck.  And he did the ultimate sellout.  He's a Jew dressing as like a Santa character on Letterman. 
[02:56:00]  Dressed as a menorah.  You want to talk about sellouts?  See, he did the ultimate sellout last night on Letterman.  Oh, just a...  Oh, he just annoys the piss out of me.  Self-important, delusional douchebag.  Come on.  I'm sitting there going, I must be the most interesting guy in the world, because...  Yeah, because I didn't hear anything about...  Yeah, Howard.  Yeah.  Oh, you are, Howard.  So interesting.  Yeah.  Yeah, you better chime in. 
[02:56:30]  You better chime in.  Your job...  You'll be out of the house and back out in the field.  You don't chime in.  You know you want to stay in the house.  It's been nice and warm in the house.  Why disagree now?  Yeah.  Yeah, Howard.  I haven't disagreed in 20 years.  I'm not going to start now.  Oh.  Oh, self-important.  When you have to say it yourself, and no one's been talking about you since you went over there. 
[02:57:00]  Yeah, you got big headlines when you left radio.  That was the news.  You were leaving radio.  Not that you were going to satellite.  That wasn't the news.  So now that you're there, no one cares.  There was a time when people used to say how important Howard was.  Absolutely.  But now it's gotten to the point where he now has to tell people how important he is.  How important and how he's the most interesting person in the world.  Who said that?  Hey, did you hear Howard is the most interesting person in the world? 
[02:57:30]  Really?  Who said that?  Howard.  But it was backed up.  Oh, really?  By who?  Uh, Robin.  His house spade backed him up.  By the way, the pen data.  Just stop it.  The pen data says, Howard, ass cave.  Oh, could you just not agree with him once?  Question something.  Oh, your embarrassment.  Call people and get them worked up.  I'm telling you, if I'd never made their call, and I'm sitting there going, I must be the most interesting guy in the world. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, because I didn't hear anything about it until Rosie made a statement.  But I didn't hear initially that Clay Aiken.  Yeah, because that was the news, you dumb fucking cunt.  That was, I didn't hear anything until Rosie said something and made the news about it.  The news was that Rosie was upset because she said it was homophobic.  Do you think it would have made the fucking news if Clay Aiken put his hand over, over, what's her name's mouth?  What's her fucking name? 
[02:58:30]  Kelly Ripper?  I can never remember her fucking name.  And who cares?  Do you think it would have made the news headline?  Clay Aiken puts hand over Kelly Ripper's mouth.  Did that make the news?  Or was it the fact that she was accused of being a homophobe by Rosie O'Donnell on The View?  Or that the most important man in the world fucking made a phone call?  Holy delusional dickbag.  The statement, I didn't hear initially that Clay Aiken had put his hand over Kelly Ripper's mouth. 
[02:59:00]  It all escalated based on this phone call I made.  Because I was upset.  And then she went and complained to Regis about it on the show.  I'm telling you.  Well, well, well.  And I thought, wow, I'm a mastermind behind this.  It's on every television channel.  It's on Entertainment Tonight.  Yeah, I heard it all the way over in London.  That's what I'm saying.  And I was like, whoa, what's going on in America?  I'm not even getting any credit for this.  Clay Aiken is covering Kelly Ripper's mouth?  Well, that was the back story.  It was all, it was Beth pointing it out to me and then me getting into a tirade and calling Kelly Ripper of all people. 
[02:59:30]  At this point, you can't even be mad anymore.  Holy, you gotta just be, he's the man.  The man is insane.  And I'm not even saying allegedly.  Well, we heard this.  He has lost his fucking mind.  We heard the stories from the big boys when we were signing with Free FM.  What happened to him?  What the fuck happened to him?  That he's taking credit.  Oh, my God. 
[03:00:00]  You don't think the Insider, these are shows I do watch when I'm eating dinner.  These dumb gossip shows, the Insider Entertainment Tonight.  You think they're going to pass on a video clip of Clay Aiken covering the mouth of Kelly Ripper?  And they need someone like Howard to point out why that would make great TV and why there's controversy there?  I didn't even hear about the hand over the mouth until Rosie said that it was a homophobic move.  Like, what?  I heard about it in England. 
[03:00:30]  Just stop.  You're a stereotype.  That's what you are.  If you listen to the show, it's not about someone coming in naked or someone being a prostitute or someone going to the bathroom in the middle of a floor.  It's why would somebody do that?  It's the first reality show.  And, you know, there was a TV critic, Marvin Kipman, used to write for Newsday. 
[03:01:00]  Great guy.  And he put an article about our show.  When I syndicated into Los Angeles, into Hollywood, he wrote this article and he said,  Howard Stern's radio show going into Hollywood will change television.  You will start to see more real television because I believe Howard Stern breaks it down.  The language is more real.  It is a more real experience.  And Hollywood needs a dose of that.  And then we saw reality TV.  And I believe we're a reality radio show.  He invented reality TV.  He invented reality TV. 
[03:01:30]  Holy fucking George Washington Carver.  You are an ass.  He just right there said he invented reality television.  Yeah, well.  This guy is certifiably insane.  You've got to be kidding me.  Well, he said he invented the view.  We're trying to get that audio.  And he also said he invented American Idol. 
[03:02:00]  He also invented the Osbournes and Friends and Survivor.  Man on the street interviews, even though What's-His-Name did it with that massive microphone back in the day.  Steve Allen.  Steve Allen did fucking street interviews, you fraud.  And, of course, he invented Unplugged on the radio.  I can't deal with this.  I can't move through existing with him saying shit like this. 
[03:02:30]  It's stunning me that he actually believes it and says it.  Remember we were talking about mental things that you think in your head but never do in real life because it's crazy?  Yeah.  One of those things would be to think that you invented a bunch of stuff.  Yeah.  But never say it because you'd come off like a lunatic.  Yeah.  Well, Howie doesn't have the filter.  No.  He just blurts this shit out. 
[03:03:00]  There is not one thing he didn't invent.  Oh, God.  Is that fun?  Could Howard invent a rock that even he couldn't move?  Question.  What a tool.  Yeah.  And just for an example, the first reality show, yeah, you're right, Snap Man from Whack Bag.  There was a show called The Ludes, I think.  Is that how you pronounce it?  L-O-U-D-S.  An American Family.  It was on P-Louds. 
[03:03:30]  Louds.  I don't know.  L-O-U-D-S.  It was on PBS, and it was pretty â€“ it was a reality show.  They had cameras in their house following them around.  I heard of a little reality show called Candid Fucking Camera.  They'd put cameras in front of people in real-life situations and see how they reacted.  That, to me, was a reality show.  It was in black and fucking white. 
[03:04:00]  Holy Jesus.  The sad part is people have bought into this crap for so long.  Oh, they can't possibly, cannot possibly still be buying into it.  I was going through some old Rolling Stone magazines and was reading the Howard Stern cover story from 1994.  Here's an excerpt I found interesting.  Interviewer, are you Beavis and Butthead's dirty uncle?  Howard, yeah, maybe.  I think Beavis and Butthead is great.  MTV wanted me to do a show for them. 
[03:04:30]  They said, we love when you comment on records.  We want a show where you'll talk over the videos.  I said, okay.  We sat down and talked money.  They had no fucking money.  Interviewer, you're saying MTV stole your idea?  Howard, no.  I think Beavis and Butthead are very original.  I'm not accusing anyone, but I pitched that idea to them.  He said, no.  I think they're very original.  I'm not accusing anyone, but I pitched that idea to them.  Beavis and Butthead.  Okay.  Chalk that one up. 
[03:05:00]  How terrific is that?  Don't be scared when I throw papers over your head, Jimmy.  I would never hit you.  I know, but you might by accident.  Oh, no.  I closed my eyes when Anthony threw papers over me.  I bark one over your face.  I know.  It would have been really embarrassing if instinctively I just jumped up with my mouth open.  I have built a career on being honest with my audience and also being an honest businessman.  I would never do anything dishonest. 
[03:05:30]  Oh, he is so done.  It's just over.  Howard, guess who had better ratings on Letterman than you did last night?  Oh, Howie!  Do you know, did you see that little graph thing about the Howard water cooler talk factor? 
[03:06:00]  It's kind of like a Google search thing.  And who's talking about Howard?  I think it was something like, did you hear what Howard said today?  That was the title.  And how no one's asking that anymore.  And they actually cited us in there and showed a little graph of how the media picked up on what we were doing and how they picked up on what he was doing. 
[03:06:30]  Right.  And how his graph was going down and ours is going up.  Yeah.  The guy has really fallen off the face of the earth.  Can you get the bandana clip?  We haven't played that one in a while.  He is just...  That's my favorite.  He's so secluded and surrounded by yes men that he doesn't really have a grasp on what really is happening.  Reality is, he's making a lot of fucking money.  But he has a minuscule fraction of the listeners he used to have and the type of listeners he used to have. 
[03:07:00]  Now he's got people that pay to hear him.  So he's not going to get the conflict, the people that don't like him, that kind of thing.  The amount of people alone isn't there anymore.  He's not making news by saying or doing anything or being involved in anything, getting behind a cause, talking about a subject, people wanting his opinion on certain subjects. 
[03:07:30]  They just don't ask anymore.  He's irrelevant.  He is not relevant to society like he used to be, where people would want to know, hey, this is an interesting topic.  What does Howard think about this?  It isn't happening anymore.  But he's just surrounded by so many fucking yes men that he can't see it.  So he says things like, I must be the... 
[03:08:00]  Hold on.  I must be the most important guy in the world.  Jesus.  No, most interesting.  Most interesting?  Is that what he said?  Yeah.  Fucking...  Oh, just fucking A.  DJ...  Followed up by a...  Yes!  Yes, Howard!  Yes!  Why should I disagree now?  Go dust the furniture.  And the reason she doesn't disagree is because she wants to take her trips to Europe. 
[03:08:30]  Right.  Uh, DJ Ain't a Lightbulb from Posthores.net.  What a great line.  Back before electricity, the entire world was unplugged.  Unplugged.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wasn't...  Wasn't music unplugged before electricity?  I invented that.  Oh, what a tool.  Let's go to CokeLogic.  CokeLogic, by the way, great video.  Oh, thank you very much.  Thank you for the support.  You're...  Great.  I think you might be the leader in the video contest still. 
[03:09:00]  I hope so.  What do you got today, buddy?  Hey, uh...  Howard Stern is exactly turning into the father from Big Fish, where don't let the truth get  into, uh, the way of, uh, like, a good story.  A good story, right.  Eventually, he starts to believe the bullshit.  Anyone who fucking looks at him just looks at him as this old doddering fool, like his fucking  son did in the movie.  I mean, Howard Stern, he's been such full of shit for so long that he's just completely 
[03:09:30]  oblivious to what people actually fucking look at him.  It is nice to see people catching on, finally.  And the way you see it is the, what I just explained, how he really isn't relevant and  people don't really care about his opinions on anything anymore.  And the fact that his Letterman appearance, which used to be events, when he would go on  Letterman, it was an event, you know?  You made sure you were in front of the TV back in the late 80s, early 90s, that whole  time, uh, when he was really relevant.  Uh, now it just, it just isn't happening.  And that's kind of showing that people aren't buying his bullshit because it's so out there 
[03:10:00]  that even the, I'm sure that the hard, hardcore brainwash fans, they'll still, still be there.  They're, they're, they're, but that, you know, the, the peripheral ones, uh, aren't  believing his bullshit.  And that circle, that circle of peripheral, uh, fans are growing smaller and smaller, where  he's only got those hardcore guys that believe anything he says.  Cause now he's just saying shit that's so outrageous.  You gotta be a lunatic to fucking believe it. 
[03:10:30]  All right, here we go.  Uh, we need the help of the ONA pest cause this will get under his skin and drive him  nuts today.  Alert the media that, uh, Anthony and I had higher ratings on Letterman than Howard did  last night.  That higher rating drive him insane.  And we've had more subscribers subscribe to us since we've been here than he did in the  same amount of time.  I guarantee he quickly looked at the overnight ratings, just assuming it was going to be through  the roof and, and guess what?  Like it used to be.  Guess what?  They weren't. 
[03:11:00]  And that's driving him nuts today.  And someone needs to tell him.  Whoopsie.  Get ahold of Mike from Friday morning quarterback.  Do some research.  Let's go.  Call the post.  People T-voted.  People T-voted.  Inside radio.  Let's go.  I invented the T-vote.  Robin.  Yes.  You did, Howard.  You did.  I remember.  You gotta have people.  I said, wouldn't it be nice to have something that you can record a TV show with?  You gotta have people around you that will tell you to shut your face.  Just to shut up your being a dick. 
[03:11:30]  What?  You need someone in your life who does this.  What?  What?  Right.  What are you talking about?  Looks at you like that.  What?  Yeah.  Kind of squints.  Turns the edges of their mouth down and goes, what?  What?  What?  Stop it.  That's all you need is once in a while a friend to go, what?  Did you hear yourself?  Come on.  Get up.  All right.  Well, let's get the pests on that.  What?  Have some fun with that.  Get through to his stupid show over there.  Hey, by the way, one of our favorite clips is ready to go.  Of course, we came up with this fine concept, Whip Him Out Wednesday. 
[03:12:00]  It is Wednesday.  The wow stickers.  They're on cars.  There's homemade wow signs.  It's written on the dirt in the back of the trucks.  Did we ever say we invented topless women?  No.  No.  Did we ever say we invented topless women on the radio?  No.  No.  Did we ever say?  Supposedly, you know, supposedly there were guys doing the topless women thing before Howard  as well.  Of course.  But the thing is, this wow concept and all we've ever said about it is that when guys  are commuting home, to take the sting out of your nightly commute or morning commute, 
[03:12:30]  it would be lovely to see a set of tits.  And to do that, you slap a wow on your vehicle, a girl sees it, and she'll flash you.  That's it.  That's all we ever claimed to.  I hadn't heard anyone doing this before that.  I'm not saying we invented nudity.  You know?  But that little twist to it was something that was original.  Yeah.  And it worked. 
[03:13:00]  Came up with a great name.  And it still works.  Great logo.  It's a fun thing.  Girl, see the wow?  Yeah.  And they whip them out.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Right.  Right.  Well, then, you know, we got a lot of press on our wow campaign.  Yep.  A lot of press.  Good and bad.  And the cities where we're really big.  Mostly bad.  I mean, there's wow stickers all over the place.  All over the fucking place.  You can't get in a car without seeing one during your drive.  Well, this drove Howard nuts to the point.  He actually said this.  Like sends through the hourglass. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, Howard sounds gay.  So is the ONA virus.  How can I honestly say anybody rips me off?  I mean, when I hear the same exact bits done, that's how I say it.  I mean, what about wow?  That's totally their idea.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  There's something new.  Well, and then.  There's something new.  You know what?  I used to do that in Washington, D.C.  Tell them, Fred.  I used to have people tie bandanas around their cars so that women would take their clothes  off in the cars.  Dude, get with it.  All right.  Well, I mean.  Give me an original idea. 
[03:14:00]  Come on.  I mean, I know.  I know.  I used to have my listeners tie a bandana around their car.  I mean, I've done it all.  What about going off on their car?  I totally know that's you.  All right.  Okay.  Whatever.  I got to go.  Please.  I don't really want to get into a discussion like this.  He's so delusional.  That is really funny.  Someone found the clip.  Yeah, that's something we couldn't play on the old show because of the gag order that  he placed on us.  How do you tie a bandana around your car?  That's a great one.  That's a big bandana.  What's the matter?  My car has cancer.  People throwing Frisbees to their cars. 
[03:14:30]  Jumping, grabbing.  God, just showing your age, man.  You can't even tie bandanas to antennas anymore.  An antenna.  It's all hippied out.  You honk the horn.  Beep.  Beep.  Dude.  Honk, dude.  You're so delusional.  Oh, man.  Just admit it.  My bandana.  Wow is such an original idea.  I invented everything.  I've done it all.  He even said, I've done it all.  Wow. 
[03:15:00]  Even the stuff that's going to be invented.  I did it already.  There's no real idea.  I went into a time machine and I already did it.  I killed himself.  Right.  I've done it all.  I love that.  Woo-hoo-hoo.  I was the first one to do anything.  I cracked it up.  Marconi ripped me off, Robin.  Remember the classic one?  What was that thing called?  Dot, dot, dash, dash, dot Morse code.  It was Howard code earlier.  The guy ripped me off.  I invented SOS.  Woo-hoo-hoo, Robin.  What a complete jackass.  He's the guy.  Wow. 
[03:15:30]  Wow.  He invented wow.  And it had nothing to do with whip him out Wednesday.  Wow.  It was tying a bandana around your car.  Thank you, Howard.  And what were we supposed to do if you saw?  I don't know.  He didn't really explain it very well.  Of course he's not going to explain.  If someone had a bandana tied around their car somehow, girls would get naked in the car?  It wasn't even flat.  Girls would get naked.  They're driving, taking their clothes off, crashing into a button, Mr. Robin.  I invented traffic accidents. 
[03:16:00]  A bandana around an antenna.  That reminds me of something else I've heard.  It's called the fucking flag.  That's not exactly somebody's fucking invention.  I invented that, Robin.  They say Betsy Ross did that.  I sewed the stars on it.  Ooh, it was all me.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I honestly don't care.  I don't care.  I invented that.  That was me.  Obi and Anthony.

We at the Obi and Anthony show would like to give those less fortunate a chance to spread  joy to the ones they love.  And the best way we know how to spread joy is to spread cash. 
[03:17:00]  All over the floor.  And blow it around the room.  With a leaf blower.  While a bunch of screaming naked women frantically try to grab as much as they can.  It's the return of the money snatch on the Obi and Anthony show.  We're looking for desperate, broke, insecure women to come in studio, get naked, chase around flying money, and cram as much of it into their holiest of holes.  All in an effort to make Christmas a little bit merrier. 
[03:17:30]  How's that Christmas tree going to look if the power gets shut off?  You can't cook a turkey if they shut off your gas.  And little Timmy is going to have a bitch of a time getting up in the morning if the heat ain't working.  So ladies, unless you want a Christmas tree with no presents underneath and a house full of crying children, sign up for the money snatch today.  Details on ObiAndAnthony.com.  XM202.  The, the, my, my. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, Rob's on it.  I was doing the money snatch years ago.  Tell him, Fred.  Yes.  Of course you were, Howard.  We're back with the Obi and Anthony show.  Ah, most shots of the year.  We kind of did that bid yesterday.  Yep.  Hey, they're ripping us off.  Hoo-hoo.  MSNBC.  Tell him, Tham.  I'm afraid to talk, because fucking Eric might just walk in and decide to blather over it.  Just, oh.  What happened?  Did he plow over you? 
[03:18:30]  Jimmy was conveying a cute little story, because during a commercial break, what we were talking about, of course, dumps.  Yeah, it's what we do talk about.  We're at that age.  And I was saying how I'm eating some almonds, and almonds tend to cause me to shit in what can only be described as a pile of something that used to be shaped.  It is no longer shaped.  It has no natural shape.  It just accepts the shape of whatever container it's in.  It's mush.  Right.  It really is mush.  That's what I was describing at. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  And I was talking about when I was a kid.  I used to kneel on the side of my bed, and I was telling a story, and then Eric just started blathering about something.  He held up something, and even if it was important show information.  This is a phone number.  We have to do it just like that.  Yeah, right to Opie.  He started talking in the middle of Jim's story.  And Jim just goes, okay, well, you just do whatever you got to do.  And he didn't stop.  He bowled through oblivious just that you were even telling a story. 
[03:19:30]  And I was saying, even if it's important, you could kind of say, Jim, excuse me one second.  I just got to like â€“ but just â€“ and what did you call him?  A bowling ball?  He's a bowling ball on a table full of Hummels.  He's a fucking â€“ a hard, circular, clunky thing just fucking knocking over what is delicate and beautiful.  Just irreparably damaging things that are good. 
[03:20:00]  A fucking bowling ball with a retard hairdo and a child's hat.  Fucking barreling over glass stories, which are contingent upon timing.  Bladder, bladder, bladder, bladder, bladder, bladder.  In the middle of a story.  He could have just said, excuse me.  I mean, we say Jim here, but it's actually Mr. Norton.  Right, right.  He could have just said, excuse me, bro.  I just want to tell him something.  I would have said, sure.  Yeah.  I would have stopped.  I know he's got business to conduct.  Hold the story.  He had no idea.  I know he didn't.  But I mean, why would I â€“ I mean, we're not doing anything important. 
[03:20:30]  I mean, you know, why would I want to tell something that I might decide to tell on the air a minute later?  I mean, why prepare that?  Why?  Great social skills.  Why is Patty here?  Oh, God.  I thought I'd just show up and say heee.  Oh, God.  I thought I'd just show up and say heee.  I want to know.  And Pat Duffy's here from the Baby Bird video.  We all remember Pat Duffy.  Who's the gentleman with you, Patty?  No, I â€“  All right, talking to the microphone.  How about a microphone?  You dummy.  How many years?  How many years have you been associated with this program, Patty? 
[03:21:00]  Eight.  Eight years.  And you don't know when you walk in the studio, before you say anything, you've got to talk into a microphone.  Yes, I know.  Do you know that we wouldn't say boo to you if it wasn't over a microphone and for the show?  What do you think?  There's a conversation.  The mics are off.  And we're socially chatting.  No, I'm just visiting.  It's my day off, so I did the walk over like I do occasionally.  So I just visited today. 
[03:21:30]  What four-year-old did you steal that barrette from?  She got a barrette in her hair.  Oh, it's awful.  Holding it back.  I know.  Just daintily off of her glasses on one side.  It's only September until she can get bobby pins.  You really are an old lady.  I hate bobby pins.  Oh, I hate the bobby pins.  I'm hoping my soldier boy comes back and brings me some nylons.  You old bat.  Who's the guy you went with the... 
[03:22:00]  Who's that guy?  Who's the heavyset gentleman with the glasses?  I didn't come with him.  I just met him during the walkover.  Really?  You just grab any cock you could and brought it up into the studio?  Good for you, Patty.  He's married or something.  You're going to let him take your ass or what?  No, he's married or something.  It doesn't matter.  I was married once, too.  Fucked like an animal.  Yeah.  Would you ever let him hold your ears and straddle your face and just give your mouth a good  cock pummeling?  I'm not trying to be inappropriate.  No disrespect.  I don't know. 
[03:22:30]  I don't do things like that.  No, of course you don't.  No.  I just want to ask Patty the fucking dirtiest questions I've ever had.  I would never ask a girl a question like that.  No.  For some reason with Patty, all I want to do is talk to you about ass-eating.  You're filthy.  You'd never let someone do that to you, would you?  No.  Why?  Wouldn't you think it would feel good?  No.  She'd be all squirming and laughing.  Unless it was my husband or a boyfriend's significant other, it's one thing.  But it's just another person. 
[03:23:00]  Natural sexy speech.  Yeah.  I'm not loose.  Unless it's a boyfriend or a significant other, I might do it.  You're a wreck.  Why is your hair so long?  Yeah.  It really is long.  Yeah, it grew.  How long did that grow and how long did it take?  Have you had a cut recently?  When it started growing?  Patty.  Patty.  Yeah.  Patty.  How long is it?  I'm watching you, O.C. 
[03:23:30]  I was trying to distract her.  He just cut a snippet of her hair.  I wish that was head clippers and you hit the neck.  No.  Head clippers.  It's too long.  No, it's not.  Let me take it into a thing.  No, thank you.  And cut it.  No.  Come on, Crystal Gale.  New.  Yeah, what do you need long hair for?  Because I like it.  It's not like you're using it for anything.  I don't care.  I like it. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, I like that, Patty.  I like that sassy Patty.  I like it, Patty.  Tell him.  I like it.  You like it.  I like it.  I like it.  Why do you keep your hymen?  I like it.  Yeah, where are we at with the virginity thing?  Why don't you cut off that hair and give it to Lox of Love?  You know what that's for?  For you, it would be to stuff a scarecrow.  My hair is growing long, and that is that.  Long and dry.  Leave it alone.  That's right.  You might want to cover up that spot.  Yeah, that part Opie just removed. 
[03:24:30]  Yeah, I have a little bald spot on top of my head.  I don't know what happened.  Turn down so we can see it.  I'll tell you if it's noticeable.  Yeah, it's right there.  Well, can you move your finger?  Yeah, usually.  Oh, please let her go bald.  No.  I hope she goes bald like an accountant.  No.  Like the information.  The horseshoe?  Yeah, yeah.  Like Joseph Goriab, as we will talk about.  When your bank says, that's who I want you to fucking go bald like.  Just the horseshoe.  Like Malkovich.  You should have a Malkovich hairline. 
[03:25:00]  The father on Mork and Mindy.  Conrad Janis.  That's who your fucking head should look like.  Conrad Janis.  I don't even know who he is.  I know you don't.  That's why two people just told you.  We could have another piece for good luck.  No.  Just go ahead.  No.  It's bad luck to just cut one piece of hair.  No.  Come on.  Hold her down.  Get the scissors.  A little piece.  No.  Opie, get away from me.  Yeah, a little piece.  No.  Come on, ass and watch.  Just that piece off the side that's sticking out of the barrette. 
[03:25:30]  Hey, come on.  There's a piece hanging out of the barrette.  The little piece, Patty.  Barrette.  A little piece.  They're going to cut you.  Oh, you're holding most of it.  There you go.  Yeah, let him cut whatever you're not holding.  You want me to cut?  There you go.  What's that?  Just cut that off.  All right.  Go ahead.  There you go.  There's more, Patty.  What are you doing?  No.  I don't know, Opie.  Leave me alone.  On the bottom of the hand.  Go ahead, Patty.  Just hold.  He'll take the split ends off.  He'll take the split ends off.  Oh, yeah.  We've got to cut out the split ends.  There you go. 
[03:26:00]  There you go.  All right.  You had your fun.  Okay.  You had your fun.  Now, go fuck yourself.  A little piece of hair.  Lock my hair.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, no.  There's a little lock of hair.  That guy is very brave, let me tell you.  Very brave?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  What is he, fighting in Iraq?  You idiot.  He ate someone's puke.  That's not brave.  It's stupid.  We call it New York Bravest.  They don't mean firemen.  They mean him.  Yeah, puke eaters of America.  Those are really cool jeans, by the way.  Let me know how the Loverboy concert is. 
[03:26:30]  Fucking.  Oh, shit.  Wow, she's got a fucking potty mouth, too, these days.  What?  No.  What?  Patty, it's time.  It's time, Patty.  No, it's not.  Come on.  Come on, Patty.  It's time.  Leave me alone.  Patty, it's time.  You haven't had your hair cut in a long time.  Can you get out of my way, please?  It's time to shave your head again.  You have no right.  No.  No, you do have a right.  We bought you.  Yes.  You're bought and paid for it. 
[03:27:00]  We invented you.  Oh, she's not going for it.  Don't touch this.  You're going to get, like, a lesson.  You could get hurt.  Yeah.  Look at her pulling the door like she's got any chance of opening it.  You're not doing that.  Here it comes.  Oh, let me do it.  There it is.  That's a good set of clothes.  All right, Patty.  Here it comes.  No.  Take the hair, Opie.  No.  Patty.  Patty, when was the last time?  It's nice.  It's a year.  It's too long.  You look silly.  I don't want you.  No.  It's winter.  You could wear hats.  No. 
[03:27:30]  N-O spells no.  How about a mohawk?  Mohawk.  They got that movie.  Apocalypto.  No.  You get an apocalypto haircut.  No.  Do you mind if he does this?  Yes, I do.  Oh, shit.  All right, so she says, wow, she's going for it.  Patty's got some balls to her these days.  No.  She's not taking any guff anymore.  Opie, get out of here.  Here it comes.  No.  And here comes the airplane landing on Patty's head.  Oh, he's swinging it by the cord over her head.  Oh, come on, Patty.  Don't be shy.  Very precarious.  Patty. 
[03:28:00]  No.  It's all for fun.  No, it's not.  Come on, Patty.  It is fun for you.  You looked good in your wig last time.  Would you stop it?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  Get away from me.  Danny should have scissors.  Yeah.  Get away from me.  Danny should have scissors discreetly.  Give Danny the scissors.  Yeah.  Danny should have scissors.  Oh, now, Patty, why don't you want to...  It's winter.  You could wear a hat.  I don't care.  You could wear a hat.  No.  No.  You don't do that to a lady... 
[03:28:30]  You don't do that to regular women.  Why did you do that to me?  No.  No.  No.  You wouldn't do it to your sister.  You wouldn't do it to your sister.  Yeah, he wouldn't.  That's because they fuck.  No.  No.  Here it comes.  No.  Uh-oh.  Here it comes.  This is like...  No.  Uh-oh.  No.  Get away from me, Opie.  Get away from me. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  No.  This is cool.  It almost sounds like Patty's being raped.  Yeah.  Get away from me.  No.  No.  It's big and black.  I don't...  No.  What would you let us do?  No.  I don't want anything.  Get away.  No.  How about just a little bit, Patty?  No.  Just six inches.  No.  Just the top of your head.  No.  Opie, leave me alone.  How about just the top of the circle part to hide the bald spot? 
[03:29:30]  No.  Yeah.  Thank you.  How about you can leave the back of it?  No.  No.  Wow.  Why?  All right, Danny.  Go for it.  Are you crying?  No crying.  Head shaving?  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  He's got to do it once she's ducking from the thing.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Well.  Just don't stab her.  Don't cry.  No.  She's petrified.  Don't stab her.  No.  Watch out for the scissors above your head. 
[03:30:00]  How about a little...  Danny's going to step a little bit.  I think that's in control.  Oh, that could have been bad.  Oh, my God.  I had nothing to do with that.  What?  What happened?  Yeah, there's a big chunk taken out of the back now.  Uh-huh.  Oh, where?  Yep.  Turn around.  Show the camera.  Let's see it.  Show the camera.  I'll tell you.  Let's see it.  What?  Turn around.  Yeah, turn around.  Let me see what...  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Turn around. 
[03:30:30]  Turn around.  Ah, there's a big chunk taken off.  Danny had the scissors.  Where?  Right in the back.  What?  Oh, my God.  It's totally...  There's a big chunk.  It's like a bite was taken out of your head.  Oh, my!  Oh, my!  Why did you do that?  Why not?  Turn around.  Show the camera.  Show the camera.  Show the camera. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, we'll show you.  We'll tell you how bad it is.  Oh, my God.  It feels thin.  It'll grow back.  It'll grow back, Patty.  Yeah, how long did that take?  Like a few weeks?  That's so wrong.  Don't cry.  Why do you want really long hair all of a sudden?  Yeah.  Go with the bob cut.  No, I don't like the bob cut.  I mean, back of the bob.  I don't know if that mic's working anymore.  It looks like just a few pubes.  Why did you do that?  You're starting to look like Mick Mars.  Why did you do that? 
[03:31:30]  Don't cry.  Don't cry, Patty.  It's okay.  It's okay.  We all love you.  You're all right.  It'll grow back.  It'll grow back.  Take a seat.  Take a seat, okay?  Take a load off.  Take a load off.  I don't believe you did that.  Why don't you sit down?  We want to do an interview.  I don't believe you did that.  Just pile up all the hair we've cut so far in front of us.  That's right.  Are you crazy?  Yeah, I see a lot.  Danny's got the scissors.  Yeah, I see it on the floor.  Aw.  Oh, well. 
[03:32:00]  We didn't mean to actually get that much off, but you moved your head at the last minute.  You were supposed to take a couple inches, didn't you?  You moved your head at the last minute, and it kind of...  Oh, my God.  Take a seat.  Go ahead.  Let's take a seat.  Take a seat.  Let's all calm down.  Acid wash.  It's just hair.  I'd love for her to sit down and take those zip strips.  Why did she do that?  Did she use his handcuffs?  Isn't that the piece on the hair?  That's the one you...  Hold on.  Give her pink belly.  That's the one you allowed me to chop. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, you nut job.  The one on the floor is the one that Danny did.  No, no, no.  Don't be so paranoid.  Yeah.  I am.  I am.  Why are you so paranoid?  Look out behind you.  Do it right behind you.  E-Rock, now.  Knocks her glasses off her head.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  I know.  What did you do?  Punch her in the face?  Yeah, why don't you jam two fingers in her eye?  Punch her.  Or let her talk, and then just fucking rock'em sock'em robot through the story.  I'm going to do things like this. 
[03:33:00]  All right, just pile that off with the rest of that.  Yeah, you could glue that back on, Maddie.  Can we do a little, pre-cut a little bit off, please?  Just a little.  I'll give you money.  Uh-oh.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  No.  You all right?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, good.  You have to understand, as a woman, you don't have the right to say that.  You're still our pals?  Hold that sideways.  Yeah.  I wouldn't put the pointy parts to the back of her neck. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, because then the ear's going to come off.  She throws her head back.  That could be a problem.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to go bust laughing?  It wouldn't help, of course.  Exactly.  Wow, there's hair on your shirt, too.  You might want to pull that part.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow, Patty.  What the hell happened?  You got a hunk out of the back of it.  Yeah, there's a big chunk missing.  You wear a ponytail for about a year.  Yeah.  It's all right.  It took me...  It took me...  It took me years.  It's all right.  It's dry. 
[03:34:00]  It looks good.  It's dry.  You haven't done that for this.  It looks good, Patty.  No offense.  Think how nice that part will look when it grows back if you condition it.  Yeah.  Why don't you look condition it?  Look at the upside.  Why do you always make lemonade or lemons and make stuff that isn't lemonade?  Why do you take lemons?  She takes lemons and she makes an unfucked pussy.  Patty, look what we have.  Yeah, I see.  A wig for someone.  The wig.  Yeah, it's the one I donated. 
[03:34:30]  Remember that?  Yeah.  You want to wear that all winter?  No.  Come on.  Let us just...  It's warm, I bet.  I don't want it shaven.  I'm sorry.  It's Christmas.  I don't care.  I don't want it shaven.  It's Christmas.  It took me a lot of time and effort to grow it.  It's my natural color.  I don't want it to leave me.  Natural color?  I see three or four different colors in a piece I cut.  You do have a lot of gray in there.  Can we shave your snatch?  So what?  I'll use hair color.  You have hair like Ron Cooby.  I don't want to look like a woman and that is that. 
[03:35:00]  I look very ugly with the bald.  I felt...  No, you didn't.  Or as it is.  You look great.  Or with anything.  No, I'm standing my ground.  I have to keep it long.  This time we'll add the tattoo on the arm with the numbers.  No.  I'm sorry.  You look great with a bald head.  No, I don't.  You put a yellow star of David on your shirt.  I don't look good.  You actually look cute with that on you.  You did.  A lot of guys like that.  No, I don't.  I don't like it. 
[03:35:30]  Everyone's saying you should do it for Christmas.  No.  Yeah, they're saying you should do it for Christmas.  Cut their hair.  Everyone is saying you should do it for Christmas.  I'll do it if you do it.  I don't want to.  You're a guy.  Guys can get away with that.  Well, you're a good one.  I'm a woman.  You know?  Debatable.  I want to be a woman.  No.  You have to have had sex to be a woman.  That's right.  That's not true.  You're just a girl.  You're just a girl.  You're just a little girl.  All right.  Why don't you just collect all your hair?  That's right.  Yeah.  Get your hair.  I can't believe you did this.  Pick up your hair. 
[03:36:00]  There's some over there, too, Patty.  Patty.  Why would you do this?  No, in front of you.  Patty, pick up that hair, too.  Wait.  No, over there.  In front of you.  Would you look where I'm pointing, you nitwit?  Right there.  Right there.  Pick up that.  That's the little one I did.  Pick up that little clump.  I don't want people to think I did the big, huge piece, Danny.  Go ahead, Cliff.  Now.  Now behind you.  No.  Stop.  You're paranoid.  I'm not a guy.  Not a guy.  No.  Come on, Danny.  Danny is so enjoying this. 
[03:36:30]  All right.  Stop it.  Please.  Yeah.  Danny, stop.  Come on.  Please.  Don't.  I didn't do anything.  All right, Patty.  All right.  All right.  There you go.  No.  Make it past the clippers and you can leave.  No.  Come on.  Stop it.  Oh, jeez.  We'll give you money.  She's running.  She's losing the will.  She's losing the will.  No.  Did you cut some?  By accident.  Yeah.  He was thrusting it towards the hair she was holding and actually tapped it with the clippers 
[03:37:00]  and more fell out.  No.  Just a little bit.  Just a piece.  I just stopped it.  Just a little piece.  Just a little.  She's staying right beyond the cord range.  This is like a foghorn leghorn and the dog episode.  Oh, stop.  Oh, my God.  Clipped a little with the scissors.  There goes another piece.  Wow, what a great strategy. 
[03:37:30]  You stayed right out of clipper range and he leaned over with the scissors and clipped  off a hunk.  No.  Oh, you fucking animal.  No.  That was funny.  No what?  You're not cutting my hair.  Okay.  I'm not going through that again.  I'm not going through that.  That helped.  That helped for me.  I agree.  That was torture.  It was.  You shouldn't have to go through that.  I didn't deserve that.  No, you didn't.  No.  Can we cut off the ends now just to even it all up?  Just the ends to even it.  I think that, I mean, you figure out. 
[03:38:00]  Let Danny just go rant with the clipper right at the ends.  No, not your scalp, you nut.  Patty.  That's what you're holding.  In all honesty, it's a little too long.  Your hair got really long.  It's uneven.  It's getting like Crystal Gale long.  Like what?  Jimmy said that?  Yeah.  Danny, you cut hair, right?  I wish I had her hair.  I would give anything to have Crystal Gale's long hair.  Yeah.  You really want your hair that long?  It just makes me feel young.  She doesn't look for age either. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, thank God.  Patty, is that what it is?  Are you feeling like a little bit of an older lady and that's making you feel like your  young girl again?  I'm not going to look like those typical ladies my age.  I see women my age.  They wear the long skirts.  Patty, if you think long hair makes you look young, you need Rapunzel's fucking hair.  I wish I had her hair.  Rapunzel's?  So do I.  I'd choke you with it.  Can we shave your box?  I already shaved it this morning. 
[03:39:00]  Oh.  Patty.  The whole thing or did you leave a little Hitler mustache or what did you leave?  I don't know.  I let the little bit.  She shaved all of it.  Not all of it.  I left a little bit.  I bet that makes you feel young.  Can we just shave it completely?  What?  With there?  With the clippers.  Well, that I wouldn't object to, but I object to my hair.  Patty.  Here's what Patty is.  Patty's ready for some dick.  The part that isn't the thing I wouldn't object to.  Yeah, Patty is so in need of cock.  All right.  That's fair, I guess.  We'll let you out of the studio if you let.  Who's going to do it, though? 
[03:39:30]  Yeah, I know.  Danny, what do you say?  I'll shave it.  All right.  You want me to spank you, Patty?  I'll give you a spanking?  Yeah, let's let Jimmy spank you.  All right.  This is what's going to happen.  It'll allow you out of the studio.  We won't touch your hair again.  And that's an Opie and Anthony promise.  Now, you have to.  We rarely give Opie and Anthony promises.  Opie and Anthony promises don't really account for much.  You're going to have to give a promise from Greg Hughes, I think.  That's right.  Greg Hughes here, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  I appreciate that.  I promise, Patty, that no one will cut any more of your hair on your head if you allow 
[03:40:00]  Jimmy to spank you bare ass and to have Danny shave whatever's remaining off your twat.  Okay.  All right.  Back to Opie.  All right.  The only thing is I got to use the bathroom because I got to go really bad.  Oh, nice.  Wait a minute.  Let's clarify this.  Wait.  I'm going to be spanking you.  You're not going in there to fucking drop a fucking yule log, are you?  No.  Oh, you got to go pee pee?  You have to drop a log?  No. 
[03:40:30]  I just have to pee.  You got pee pee?  All right.  So there's going to be a little curled up now?  A piece of hair underneath that you're going to have to.  No.  Sorry, but I don't trust you.  You could use the wastebasket.  No.  I'll bet you she's going to go drop a fucking five pounds of butterscotch pudding, enough  to fill a salad bowl.  She's going to go sit there.  She's going to fucking drop.  It's going to look like a bowl full of tabbouleh.  I'm going to get up to go.  Shut up.  Can I finish, please?  For the love of God, you have the timing of fucking Eric's. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, you're right.  All right.  Listen.  I'm going to go to Spanker, and I'm going to fucking come off with a light, flavorful  looking but not smelling residue.  No, you're not.  Shut up, caramel hiney.  I'm going to look like I have a fucking like, you ever get a sundae with just a little caramel  coating?  That's the type of water dump she's going to get in there and take.  The thank God I have my hair shit.  The system is too nervous to process it, so it's just a fucking watery evacuation like  an animal.  Like the way a fucking animal shits when a tiger's attacking you. 
[03:41:30]  It's like your asshole's just going to open up, and it's going to spill like fucking soup  through a trap door.  Nice fucking stew dump.  All right.  It's obvious we've got a hostage situation here.  But we're willing to, like, negotiate.  You know, if you suck on Danny's hog, we'll let you out right away, or you get the spanking  from Jim Norton and the shaving of the pubis region. 
[03:42:00]  I agreed to number two, but I do have to pee.  All right.  Well, we've got some guards.  Guard the bathroom.  Make sure she doesn't escape.  I'm not going to escape.  I've got to pee, too.  Don't you dare jump out the window.  Can I pee, too?  Because I might want to fluff up and get a rod while I'm spanking her.  All right.  All right.  Jimmy, why don't you pee?  Oh, fuck.  We'll bring her back in, and we'll continue this mess.  He is too fucking funny, man. 
[03:42:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful  bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow stickers have many other uses?  I remove unwanted bottom hair with Wow stickers.  Oh, God.  My sphincter's bleeding.  That's a raw anus.  It's the Opie and Anthony.  Get your official Opie and Anthony Wow stickers at opiananthony.com.  Oh, God.  My poopy hurts.  Don't be such a girl, Travis. 
[03:43:00]  XL 202  Ah, we're back.  I want a pest briefing.  A debriefing.  Where are we at with the Howard thing?  I see we made allaccess.com.  Allaccess picked it up.  I see we're on, is it Orbitcast or one of those other websites?  It's already spreading some of the crap we spewed this morning, thanks to the ONA pest.  The pests are great at taking the news, stuff we say about the news, and running with it 
[03:43:30]  and getting it to the proper channels.  Absolutely.  I need a debriefing from somebody.  What have we accomplished so far?  In the meantime, as they call in, it's Dr. Patty.  Hi, Patty.  Hi.  Okay, listen, we have a hostage situation here, obviously.  We want to shave your head, and you just will not have it, but we've got to do something  with you.  So you have agreed to let Jimmy bear, spank your bear ass.  Yeah.  And then Danny is going to shave the remaining pubes off your body, and then you're allowed 
[03:44:00]  to leave.  Okay.  And if you don't accomplish either one of these things, then we shave your head completely.  And tea bag you.  All right.  All right.  I like tea.  Hey, um...  Our, uh...  I fucking was actually going to ask her.  What happened?  What happened?  I lost my thought.  Aw.  Oh, um...  Go.  I hope you dabbed at that with a tissue, because you're going to be over my knee with your little... 
[03:44:30]  with your little vagina sticking up.  I'm hoping...  Did you wipe good?  My what?  Did you wipe your, uh...  Of course I do.  Your wet spot good?  I'm very hygienic.  Very hygienic.  Would you like a glove, Jimmy?  No.  All right.  You should be all right.  Yeah.  I don't have anything anyway.  You will after this is over.  I can pass my ass on.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, you will.  Oh, that's good.  Dave from West Orange really helping us out.  One of the pests.  He, uh...  He told the Daily News that Howard has an ass cave.  Well, thank you. 
[03:45:00]  That was a quote.  All right.  Well, we want all our quotes out there.  All right.  Are we ready?  What do you want to...  I guess we start with the spanking.  Well, yeah.  I mean, well, let me see.  Look, let's stand up and see how much hair she has to go.  Yeah, Patty, why don't you show us how much hair you got down there?  All right.  I wouldn't mind spanking her once she's sure.  You're an old hat.  Wait, wait.  Let's see your panties.  Pull your...  Pull those up.  They stay sexy on them.  And pull your shirt up a little bit.  You got...  The famous, uh...  Well, uh...  The famous, um... 
[03:45:30]  What's the point?  Harry pair of pants.  That's...  They gave me after you did carry on me.  What's on the back?  What's on the undershore in the back?  It says sexy on them.  I know, but are they boy shorts?  Let me see.  She's wearing superhero pants.  It says sexy around the waistband.  They were given to me.  There are little stars of various colors all over them.  They're like boy shorts.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Her ass looks good in those.  That rump looks good.  I'm going to give you...  Oh, you really are spankable.  It's like a juicy little rump.  Well, I'm not ugly. 
[03:46:00]  What the fuck are you wrestling for a living?  Where do you got so many black and blues on you?  What?  You're all bruised up on your legs.  I don't like your appendix scar either.  You look like me.  Imagine after hours Patty's into like a wrestling fetish club.  Yeah.  I got a fetish.  No, I have a cat.  She's not good with her claws.  A fucking tiger?  And she gets excited and playful and she accidentally scratches me.  Yeah?  But she doesn't do it on purpose.  You ever put some friskies down by your vag and let her...  No.  A little rough tongue? 
[03:46:30]  A little sandy tongue?  No.  Right down on your clitoris?  Watch the cat eat and then throw up?  No.  No, but she likes to lay down with me and put her head on my shoulder.  Oh, that's adorable.  That's adorable.  Well, let's see how much hair you have.  Those little sexy boys, they say sexy around them.  Yeah, it says sexy all over them.  They were picked out to me by Kenny's wife who went clothes shopping to replace the clothes  that were ruined during Carrie.  Yeah.  At the PNC Bank Arts Center.  I ripped those down. 
[03:47:00]  Oh, yeah, you got some left there.  It's like you missed some.  You got some left.  Yeah, I didn't do a great job.  She has a fat little puss.  I just didn't.  You always comment on how much you like her snack.  Fat little puss.  Snatch.  You shave like an old man who's kind of hungover and shaking.  Like you just miss half the beard and then fucking just go to work.  Well, it's because I use a regular shaver.  I don't really have one of those electric ones, you know.  They're too expensive now.  I can't afford them. 
[03:47:30]  Is this legal?  It's like we're making fun of the retarded.  Yeah.  No, it's fine.  You sure?  And it is legal to make fun of the retarded.  Absolutely.  I'm not retarded.  Okay.  Great.  Does it smell?  Tell me if it smells.  Fuck you, Philly.  Philly can go fuck themselves.  Go fuck yourselves.  How about a little support?  Jesus.  How about telling a friend?  Oh, shit.  Sit here.  Fuckers.  The old Flatline Express.  See if we fucking take the virus back to Philly. 
[03:48:00]  Cocksuckers.  Let's you yell at our comic friends like that.  Yeah, fuckers.  Ah.  All right, Patty.  So you shave, but you don't really shave the middle.  No, because I can't get down that way that part.  What do you mean, can't get down that way?  How do you wipe it after you go to the...  You can't get down that way.  No, no.  It's just that the razor that I use...  All right, can we get to the shaving?  She doesn't want to slice off a piece of roast beef.  All right, what are we doing over there? 
[03:48:30]  Let him shave her.  A dry shaver with a bick.  Exactly, like Rambo.  You're going to use the electric clippers?  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah.  You wearing sexy on those underwear, that's like fucking Eric wearing underwear that says  competent.  Adult.  Could you pull your fucking underwear down?  Please.  Yeah.  You're going to be pubes in them.  Yeah.  You're going to itch.  Look inside those underwear. 
[03:49:00]  Are there any stains?  That shit makes you itch.  No.  Danny?  What's going on in there?  It doesn't look like it.  All right.  Nah, it looks all right.  All right.  Yeah, clip that shit off.  Yeah, please.  Roughly.  Just go over both lips.  Get rid of that nasty...  You've got to shave with a razor, you don't...  And by the way, I made a promise.  We can't mess with her hair on her head.  No hair.  If she does this.  Patty, why don't you shave your...  Because I don't know, should you shave her lips with that?  Let her...  You've got to use a regular razor, man.  That won't hurt.  It's a clipper's, right?  All right.  But what if her clit falls off?  I don't think it will.  She doesn't need it anyway.  Unless it cracks off.  It's true.  But just go over it.  I don't care if it looks like Bluto's mouth. 
[03:49:30]  She should probably sit.  I mean, if I do it...  Sit down.  All of the hairs is going to fall into a pen.  Sit down and spread them like you're at the fucking gino's office.  Patty, just take off your shoes and your socks.  Yeah, just throw one leg over the other, the old chair thing.  Can you sex it up a little bit?  Sex it up is impossible.  She looks like an 11-year-old girl getting naked to fool around with a boy.  That's like the method she's using.  11?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Just that stupid, child-like...  What ever happened to those dancers that were supposed to show me how to do something like that? 
[03:50:00]  They ran away.  They were tired.  I'd love to know.  Now, Patty, stop sitting like that.  Yeah.  There you go.  Open up and let's...  Throw your leg over the chair thing.  Yeah, over the chair handle, arm wrap.  Yeah.  Like, show your...  Jesus, this is so awful.  That's not how I do it at home.  No?  What do you do at home?  I just stand over the toilet and I just...  That thing's just yearning for a cock.  That's a fat one, too.  Look at it.  She's a fat little puss. 
[03:50:30]  That thing is yearning.  Yearning.  Yeah.  It needs a helmet in there.  You should let Jimmy tag you.  Yeah?  Should she?  You should give Jimmy more money.  Just offering you up.  Explain that to my cock when it's fucking wilting like fucking nitrous was dumped onto it.  Someone wants us to check her panties for skid marks.  I had Danny do that already.  Yeah.  Oh, you did?  First thing I did when I saw white underpants.  Of course.  I don't have anything. 
[03:51:00]  Well, if you put a dog or something.  Well, you might not wipe good.  Who knows?  You probably should have a lot.  Everyone gets skid marks.  Everyone plays a little game of bingo in their fucking underwear every once in a while.  I like that.  What does that happen?  I prefer it.  A man without skid marks isn't a man, I always say.  Right.  Isn't a true man.  Anything else fun coming in?  All Access quoted me.  All Access quoted me.  I'm very excited.  Yeah.  Are we going to do this? 
[03:51:30]  What?  Yeah, let's go.  There it goes.  All right.  No, Patty.  What do you want me to do?  You got to spread them.  Like?  Yeah.  Like wide.  Like that?  That's a wide shaver.  Yeah, like that.  Lean back more and spread them.  I've never done anything like this before.  Of course you haven't.  I don't know, but you're 50 at a radio station.  Anything that involves that vagina of yours.  What's the matter, Danny?  You ain't got a clue, do you?  He's got gray ones.  Oh, you got some gray fumes in there? 
[03:52:00]  I don't know.  It's not my fault.  Shut up.  I don't make it.  You know what it looks like?  It looks like Nick Nolte's mouth in his mug shot.  That could be one reason why I tried to clear the area.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, because you don't like the gray ones?  No.  Well, all right.  Danny, give it a swath.  See if you can get a good swath out of that.  What did you do?  Just clock Dan in the leg?  That was nice.  All right, here we go.  Let's go. 
[03:52:30]  Here we go.  I think you're supposed to do it the other way.  I don't want to get any caught in the...  Oh, dude, this is going to be a disaster.  All right, I got you.  This is going to end with blood.  Well, I hope so.  Let her rip.  I can't look.  We'll turn it off.  Her lips will be all caught in it.  Like when you get your ankle caught in a chain of a bicycle.  Just be some meat.  There you go.  How does that feel, Patty? 
[03:53:00]  It just feels weird.  A little ticklish?  Not terribly comfortable.  No?  No.  Ew.  Ew.  He just blew the hair out of the blades.  Isn't that the official shaver of this station?  Is that the one that's used for everyone's head?  Because I know Ron and Fez, every other day someone's head's getting shaved because they  lost a fucking bet.  Oh, now they're going to have to worry.  If they nick themselves, they're going to get some kind of a 50-year-old virgin woman 
[03:53:30]  disease.  Menopause.  I'm sorry, sir.  You've got menopause.  Like shaking.  Are you talking over there?  Oh, you're shaking.  Don't know.  You like the way it feels, Patty?  You like that?  Hey, Patty, no one is looking at it.  Did that used to be like closed up more?  What do you mean?  Like you see how it's kind of, you know, hanging out?  Yeah.  Is that gravity over 50 years or is that just...  I don't know. 
[03:54:00]  Everybody says I look good for my age.  They think you're ready.  You know, I don't look like one of those old ladies walking down the street where they  really do...  No, because your fucking legs are spread.  In a radio station.  In a radio station.  Of course you don't.  Yes.  Are you done?  I don't know.  Is that it?  That's as far as I think I should go without getting any of that caught up in the blades.  There's a lot going on down there.  From the side, it looks like Mick Jagger enjoying the tequila worm.  Exactly.  Why don't you slap some high karate on it? 
[03:54:30]  It's itchy.  It's itchy?  Yeah?  So scratch it.  Yeah.  I'd rather shave a cadaver.  He just did.  It's shaking all over.  Yeah, huh?  That's the best you are.  That's an added bonus.  She just brushed all the pubes onto the floor.  Oh, good.  I'm sorry.  It was just the natural reaction.  All right.  It's time for the spanking.  I want to spank.  All right.  A little spank.  You got to spank her now.  Part of the deal. 
[03:55:00]  Jimmy, now you have to, Jim.  Yes, it is.  She's all ready for you.  This is purely not sexual.  This is purely you did something wrong.  Just brutal.  How are we going to do this?  Do you want to come here and bend over, Patty?  Yeah, Patty, go over to Jimmy now and bend over.  Actually, bring the chair with you and hold on to the handrails and bend over.  Horrific.  Horrific.  Here you go.  Yeah.  She is such a, like, Abu Ghraib prison inmate. 
[03:55:30]  Not quite as sexy.  Now, face Jimmy.  Did you shit today?  I mean, no.  With your ass.  You didn't shit today?  Why not?  Because I didn't eat yet.  Oh, God.  Jesus, I didn't eat yet.  Patty, face the chair and grab the armrest on the chair.  Look how long my toenails are.  I swore that.  Grab the fucking armrest.  Now, bend over.  Touch your head.  Touch your head on the back of the chair. 
[03:56:00]  No!  Touch your head on the back of the chair.  I don't want to do this.  Jimmy looks like you just ate a bad fucking...  No, no.  I wish you had a tub of lard.  Jimmy, she's got to be over your fist.  Doesn't she have to be over your knee?  No, she doesn't.  Why don't you bend this way, Patty?  Like, this way.  All right.  I'm scared.  How do you think I feel?  My hand has to go near that thing.  You just get to stand there and feel the pain.  And I have to look at it and touch it.  At least you're you.  I have to get a mic on it.  You want a glove or something?  No, I'm not fucking doing a prostate check. 
[03:56:30]  I wouldn't touch that.  Does she have a prostate check?  She might.  Oh, I thought you did it.  Oh, my God.  You thought I did it already?  What?  No, I thought you were doing it.  No.  Danny's pointing.  Did a long hair hang off your ass?  Is there a hair on your ass?  Jimmy.  I don't know.  No.  Lift your shirt up.  Yeah.  Jimmy, lick your pointer finger and just give her the old wet willy.  Jimmy.  I can't do it.  I can't do it.  Put the glove on.  All right.  Let me put the glove on.  Put the glove on and give her a little spanking. 
[03:57:00]  That'll give you a little more security.  All right, Jimmy's...  We have any...  Yes.  Just to make sure.  Just baby powder.  All right.  Yeah.  Jimmy's got a little glove on or something.  He's cracking his nose.  Let me have two gloves, please.  Just see where...  Why?  Because sometimes I want to hold open the crack.  He's got to be able to touch your thigh and then smack your ass. 
[03:57:30]  Don't you know how ass-smacking is done?  Well, of course you don't.  Oh, it is so itchy.  Yeah, I know.  They'll take care of that, believe me.  You don't know how itchy it is.  Yes, I do.  The little mic gang.  Someone's going to have to mic patty.  It's got to go down below.  The little sting.  Get an intern to help you out there.  There you go.  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Now, first thing I'm going to do...  This mic stay...  How long were they going to fix this?  Maybe like they did in prison.  What?  Nothing.  Now, this is really hard to do with the mic like this.  Is it?  Hold the mic.  Hold the mic.  It's not Eric's fault.  Now, what I'm going to do first, I'm going to place both hands there. 
[03:58:00]  Atta girl.  I got both hands on your backside.  Very sexy when you're hunched over, by the way.  Like you're fucking touching your toes in the gym when you're five.  Jimmy, you're going to take your dick's finger and just jam it up her ass.  Little spanking.  I scared the hell out of me.  I know.  Little spank.  It's okay, little girl.  Little spank.  It's okay.  That's okay.  What are you doing?  Little spanking.  Get that bottom nice and wide.  Wait.  Why did you get it? 
[03:58:30]  Shh.  I've never been so much.  He's going to do it really hard.  No, I'm not.  I'm scared.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you?  Money shot.  It's a little boop.  Shh.  That doesn't hurt, does it? 
[03:59:00]  It just scares me.  Just touch it.  Just touch it.  It scares the hell out of me.  Just touch it.  I'm so scared.  What did you do?  What did you do? 
[03:59:30]  It went right up my...  It went right up my...  My...  No, it didn't.  Believe me.  I just touched the tip of my finger.  I knew it was a surprise.  To the brown eye.  Now smell it.  No.  Have...  Where's our newest intern?  I didn't put it in.  I just touched the hole.  Yeah, I know.  But where's our newest intern?  Yeah, get Pat Duffy.  Oh, no.  Have Pat Duffy lick that finger on the glove. 
[04:00:00]  Well, can I...  Can I...  I didn't do it right.  Can I do it?  I won't hurt you.  I promise you.  Just let him touch it.  Bend over a little bit.  Well, I know.  It was unexpected.  I know.  Bend over.  Bend over.  Bend over.  One more thing to do.  Just let him touch...  Just let him touch it.  All right.  One more thing.  One more thing to do.  Just going to touch.  I'm not going to hurt you.  Holy fucking chimpanzee.  You sounded like a chimp. 
[04:00:30]  I feel like I'm going to pass that.  You and me both.  Oh, no.  You're so lightheaded.  Well, sit down, Patty.  Go ahead.  Take a seat.  All right.  Please get her clothes on before she passes out.  Now, he's going to suck this, but he's not sucking it off my finger.  No, no, no.  Take the glove off.  I got to sit.  All right.  What?  I got to sit.  All right.  Put your pants on.  Put your clothes back on before you pass out.  See, what's that place other than my...  You're an asshole.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Wow.  You went to the other place. 
[04:01:00]  I felt it.  There's the finger.  Pat, would you put that finger of that glove in your mouth?  Sure.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Oh, man.  That's so...  It's a little...  There's an essence on it, if you want to call it that.  Is there?  Dude, I just tickled the...  She screamed because she was surprised.  I wouldn't jam my finger up.  That's like an asshole.  No, of course not.  I just...  I touch the asshole.  Almost like when, like, Sam will come in and I'll go...  I'll just give his head a little touch. 
[04:01:30]  Like, ah, how you doing, buddy?  Yeah, you get a little touch.  It's not nothing sexual.  He just touched your little bunghole.  I'm so lightheaded.  Yeah.  No, I'm lightheaded.  You probably haven't eaten yet and your asshole just got touched.  Get some clothes on.  He didn't just spank me, though.  He did something else.  I know.  We've said it eight times.  It's not a mystery.  I tickled your asshole.  That was so sneaky.  You never had your asshole touched?  No.  By a doctor?  What are you, a communist?  I don't remember.  Who'd you vote for? 
[04:02:00]  Fucking Gormachev?  I've never so much as had a gynecology exam.  All right.  What?  No.  All right.  Because the last time they tried to do it and I almost passed out that they decided  the doctor was too afraid to do it.  Just said, get unerous cancer.  We don't care.  He didn't give you a pap smear?  He went with the instrument inside my vagina and it hurt so bad that I almost passed down.  Did you yell?  Yeah, I did. 
[04:02:30]  What did he put in?  He put that metal thing in?  Yeah, and it hurt so bad.  The spank of him.  Hey, we got some phones here.  Matt in Boston.  What's up, Matt?  Spoken like a true rapist, Obie.  Put your clothes on before you pass out.  Well, that was really, really, and Pat again.  Yeah.  Wow.  Terrific.  He gave it a sniff before he put it in his mouth, too.  What did it smell like?  Vagina.  Did it?  Yes, it was disgusting.  Because it was asshole.  It was like.  It doesn't matter. 
[04:03:00]  Exactly how you would imagine.  Wait, it smelled like vagina.  It was disgusting.  Well, no.  A 50-year-old vagina, as you would imagine, it's a smell.  Steve in South Dakota.  Yeah, you guys are unbelievable.  I forgot something.  I'm heading to work.  I get out of the car.  We're cutting hair.  I go inside.  I come back out.  We're shaving pussies and tringers in the ass.  Yeah, it happens quick.  That's the beauty of this show, sir.  It's all about fun.  Let's go to Doughboy.  Doughboy.  Hey, guys.  Perhaps Uncle Paul is in the studio and would like to do a little spanking. 
[04:03:30]  I know.  Oh, she's 45 years too late.  Thank you, Uncle Paul.  Black bag rules.  It does.  All right.  Well.  Wow, man.  Yeah, well.  Full-blown age is nothing to shake a stickhead either.  Oh.  We're making divisions here in the studio?  No.  I was being inclusive as opposed to exclusive.  All right, Patty, scram.  Bye, Patty. 
[04:04:00]  Patty, you want some raw almonds?  No.  You hungry?  You want to eat?  No, thank you.  You're not hungry?  No.  Go splash some water on your face.  Yeah, exactly.  Go sit in the tub and shake until the water's cold.  Sit on the bottom of a shower.  I'll run on you.  And just so people can see what was going on behind the scenes, everyone in the studio  was signaling to me to jam a finger up her ass.  And these fucking guys actually passed out lube.  Like I was going to lube my finger and sexually assault the virgin.  You guys out of your minds?  I'm not fingering the ass of a fucking unsuspecting virgin. 
[04:04:30]  Not on camera.  Anyway, that's a fucking...  It's awful.  It's called a felony is what you're looking for.  I just tickled it.  Yeah.  Give it a little touch.  Yeah, just as a surpiser.  Yeah.  But no, the finger of someone's ass is kind of fucking bordering on assault.  A little touch.  Bordering on assault?  Yeah, I mean, it's just awful.  Yeah, it really is.  Do you have any finger of a person's ass?  When they don't expect it.  Even when they do, it's not nice.  When they don't...  Imagine that you're at the doctor or at the dentist. 
[04:05:00]  Because then you really wouldn't expect it.  Yeah, sometimes you do, though.  And then you just get a finger jammed up your ass.  As punishment for those cavities.  They'll show you about not brushing those teeth.  The show is fucked up.  She just came by to say hi.  Yeah.  We just assaulted her.  There we go.  Shaved her pubes and cut a bunch of her hair off.  It tickled her asshole.  We all laughed about it.  That was a little tickle.  I have no idea.  Tommy Field looks good, by the way.  All right, listen.  It's Bodog...  I don't know what the fuck this is.  Bodogfight.com.  No, it's a wonderful thing. 
[04:05:30]  It's Bodogfight.com.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Yeah, sponsored by Bodogfight.com.  It's a cool website.  Check it out for yourself.  Here's the runner-up line of the day.  That's as far as I think I should go without getting any of that caught up in the blades.  There's a lot going on down there.  From the side, it looks like Mick Jagger enjoying the tequila worm.  Ooh.  Yes.  Are we going to run a rope?  Exactly.  Why don't you slap some high karate on it?  That was the line. 
[04:06:00]  High karate.  That was a trick.  It looks like Anthony got it.  That's a better line.  He should have.  We were always pulling it out of our ass late in the show.  Well, late in the show.  Slap some high karate on it.  Pling it out of your ass, putting it in.  I like to wear high karate.  We end today's show with Line of the Day, sponsored by Bodogfight.net.  Live from the OPN...  Stop!  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, thank God. 
[04:06:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What were you going to play?  Line of the day.  No, but what did you hit by accident?  The Daily Dump.  The Daily Dump, of course.  Yes.  Oh, look at him.  He just goes...  I don't know.  Obama!  Told you.  Oh.  I was on the Obama thing.  If him and Hillary run the same ticket...  Oh.  Let me see.  50 states to none.  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  Republicans could run a fruit.  It doesn't matter.  All right.  It's Line of the Day.  Bodogfight.com.  A what?  Or a what?  Here comes the Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  That's the type of water dump she's going to be in there and take to thank God I have 
[04:07:30]  my hair shit because the system is too nervous to process it, so it's just a fucking watery  evacuation like an animal.  Like the way a fucking animal shits when a tiger's attacking you.  It's like your asshole's just going to open up and it's going to spill like fucking soup  through a trap door.  Nice fucking stew dump.  All right.  It's obvious we got a hostage situation here.  So, um...  Soup through a trap door.  I got Line of the Day. 
[04:08:00]  Hostage, yep.  Hostage situation here.  That was it.  Line of the Day was so, uh...  All right.  So, uh...  I get a victory today.  Write it down.  Right?  That's how it works.  Last line.  Look at that.  Sure.  Oh, boy.  How are we going to tell him?  All right, guys.  We had fun today.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Who the fuck knows?  I know.  I do think we had a good time.  I had fun.  Who the fuck knows in the end?  Now it's time.  I'm going to take a nap. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  An old napski.  I have to buy my girlfriend a Christmas present, and I don't know what to get her.  You might want to wash your hands first.  Yeah, at least before you give it to her.  And I know what she wants, but there's no way I'm opening my veins in a tub.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wow.  Just get the engagement ring.  Please hold.  Hold on.  There we go.  Boy, can I set...  A fucking old set-up punch boy.  I deliver the set-up, and then conveniently, I have a line to go with it. 
[04:09:00]  What a fucking cunt I am.  Spoiler of the fun.  I finger a chick's ass, and I can't be happy with that.  I got to get greedy with a fucking cornball line.  You know?  My parents moved, and I still can't find them.  Can we just go?  Yeah, I just want to see fucking Steve's ill-fitting shirt and perfectly smooth arms.  Hello.  Can we end one show professionally? 
[04:09:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Nice arms, dick.  Thank you.  Now, we all know that Opie and Anthony Wow Stickers are your tickets to seeing some beautiful bosoms.  Well, yeah.  Did you know that Wow Stickers have many other uses?  I use Wow Stickers around the house to keep raccoons away from my garbage.  Come here, little fella.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, he's biting my balls.  Jesus Christ, my balls.  Ouch, ouch, my balls.  My balls are being bit by a raccoon here, people.  Dude, raccoon eating my balls here. 
[04:10:00]  Raccoon on balls.  Hey, buddy, can you see the raccoon dangling from my crotch?  Opian Anthony!  Get your official Opian Anthony Wow Stickers at opiananthony.com.  Derek, there's something hanging off your balls, man. </pre>
