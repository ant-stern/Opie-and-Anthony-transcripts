<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristic vulgar and comedic banter, punctuated by references to sex and bodily functions, and self-deprecating jokes about the show's absurdity.  A significant portion of the early show revolved around a mistake by board operator Sal, who played the Friday intro music on a non-Friday show. This led to a discussion about Sal's job performance and the hosts' disdain for middle management. E-Rock's absence was explained as a pre-planned day off.  The conversation then shifted to a news story about storm chasers who died in Oklahoma, with the hosts portraying them as thrill-seekers.  They viewed and commented on viral videos of storm chasers facing severe weather, analyzing the inherent dangers and motivations behind storm chasing.  A substantial segment focused on a 60 Minutes piece about a woman who, after a debilitating illness, underwent experimental brain surgery to control a robotic arm with her mind. The hosts expressed wonder at this scientific advancement, discussing its implications and future potential. A caller shared a personal anecdote about a relative using a similar prosthetic arm.  The discussion continued with further exploration of advancements in robotic limbs and their potential for amputees and those with paralysis.  Throughout this section, the hosts continued their use of highly offensive language and crude humor.

The show then transitioned to a discussion, including caller Bob Levy, on robots and artificial intelligence, featuring humorous speculation about humanoid robots and a brief anecdote about a robotic dog.  A promotional segment for a future show featuring E-Rock followed, presented in hyperbolic and comedic fashion.  This was followed by a comedic montage of sounds the hosts made when their microphones activated. A Dollar Shave Club sponsorship led into a bizarre story from Bob Levy about unknowingly having sex with a woman who had a prosthetic arm.  Upcoming guests were announced: Doc Gooden, Ethan Hawke, David Lee Roth, and Jay Mohr. Jim Norton recounted a debate he had with feminist blogger Lindy West about rape jokes, sparking a lengthy discussion on comedy, offense, and free speech, involving Kevin Smith (who was present in the studio) and the hosts, debating the line between offensive humor and harmful commentary.

The broadcast then shifted to Michael Douglas's statement about possibly contracting throat cancer from oral sex, resulting in a humorous and sexually explicit discussion among the hosts and Kevin Smith about oral sex, HPV, and the cultural perspectives on sexual practices.  Anecdotes about Jim Norton's and Anthony Cumia's early sexual experiences were shared, including Anthony's story about his father facilitating his first sexual encounter at age 13.  Further movie discussion and a search for a film starring Sylvia Kristel concluded this segment.

A significant portion of the show involved a movie review segment focusing on *After Earth*, *Oblivion*, the new *Star Trek* reboot, and *Man of Steel*.  The hosts critiqued plot points and special effects, notably criticizing inconsistencies in *Star Trek*'s use of transporters. They also discussed Will Smith's rumored Scientology involvement, reignited by *After Earth*.  *Man of Steel* received enthusiastic praise for a specific scene showcasing Lois Lane's acting and the film's visual effects. A Gillette sponsored segment promoting "How Does He Shave.com,"  asking viewers how Superman shaves, led to a discussion of John Byrne's 1986 explanation from a Superman comic, and various humorous alternative theories from Bill Nye, Mayim Bialik, the Mythbusters, and one of the hosts, who proposed a "rocket theory."  Kevin Smith, again, briefly discussed his animated film. A caller then recounted an incident where he mistakenly reported a malfunctioning bus sign to 911.  Finally, another guest, Jimmy, discussed his experiences with two demanding but effective personal trainers, including detailed descriptions of their appearances, personalities, and training methods, often using vulgar language, and an anecdote involving one trainerâ€™s camel toe. The show concluded with a discussion about Amy's Baking Company from *Kitchen Nightmares* and the owners' bizarre behavior.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, this is insane.  So, flatulent.

But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King.  Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:01:30]  Go!  Go!  I know you feelin' the flow.  But Opie's motherfuckin' things tryin' to get blown.  They would come to play around if you're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothin' like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about gettin' shot when you're with Anthony.  Oh yeah!  On the edge of your chair.  Cause you really wanna hear.  Opie Anthony and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Opie Anthony show.  Yeah!  Check it out. 
[00:02:00]  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  50!  Yeah!  Now Mike Tyson up in this pit.  It's the Opie Anthony show.  Booga booga!  Booga booga!  Booga booga!  Enough of this plava!  Let's get this show on the road.  Way to go Sal.  Alright.  Way to go Sal.  Last show before the weekend.  It's Friday I guess.  It's Friday right?  Because.  That's the Friday song.  We only play that on Friday now I guess. 
[00:02:30]  What happened?  Yo Sal.  What happened?  Sal's comment.  Obviously Iraq's not here today.  Yeah we have this one thing that we load up for the Friday thing and I accidentally put  it into the today.  That's all it was.  You know how easy your job is right?  That's all it was.  That's all.  Don't worry.  There's many many different animals that could do your job.  You realize that right?  And you fucked it up.  I apologize guys.  I'm sorry.  A goat.  A goat could easily do your job.  A goat could do the job if you set up buttons right.  A goat could press a button.  Sure.  A cute kitten. 
[00:03:00]  A kitty.  A little cute kitty.  Could do Sal's job.  Could do Sal's job.  Certainly a monkey.  What about an emu?  An emu.  I think an emu could do it.  What kind of like paws does an emu have?  It's a fucking paw.  What a hoof.  Yeah.  Hoof.  It's a cinema.  Bunch of bees.  Bees.  Bees.  To land on buttons.  To land on buttons.  All right.  Bees.  As long as you put honey on certain buttons.  Honey on certain buttons.  Right, right, right.  Many, many animals could do the job of Sal.  Sam, how hard is that job in there? 
[00:03:30]  To my health.  Break it down.  Break it down for us.  It's not difficult because I don't think working here.  I don't think any of the jobs here are difficult.  Yeah.  Quite frankly.  Because the show itself.  We're only here from 530 to 1005.  Yeah.  And then you guys don't see us for the rest of the day.  So how hard could it be?  Because the guys that babysit the channel, they're not fucking bothering you guys.  Because they don't know what they're doing.  No.  And everything that's on the air.  Yeah.  You guys just do it.  Right.  Like there's not much for us to do.  No, you guys set it up nice for us and then we have to make something out of all this. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  All we have to do is the shell.  And all Sal had to do was put the proper fucking intro in.  That's it.  I think that's all he has to do today.  Sal's job to not screw up for four hours.  That's it.  Right.  In Sal's defense.  Oh.  Whoa.  Wow.  Look who's stepping forward.  Travis is lapping Sal's ass for some reason.  That intro was clearly labeled Friday.  Oh. 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  He spun around.  He spun around.  He spun around.  He spun around.  That was a wrestling move.  Oh, yeah.  Take that, brother.  I was going one way and then went the other way.  I like that.  And you know what's the craziest thing?  Yeah.  Sal spends so much time making fun of E-Rock for being incompetent.  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  And then his first opportunity with E-Rock not here, you make E-Rock look like a superstar.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  You got to make sure to secretly...  Wait.  Where is E-Rock today?  Where is E-Rock? 
[00:05:00]  Where is E-Rock?  He's taking a little personal day for himself.  Can we call him?  Yeah.  See how his personal day's going?  I'm glad to call him right now.  Didn't he have something to do yesterday and that's why he's not here today?  Well, yeah.  He's taking some nagle time.  What did he do?  A sit-up yesterday?  He's a bit achy.  He's a bit achy from his sit-up.  I had to take a day for myself.  I do recall we spoke to him about doing something.  He had some plans.  Oh, he did?  Oh, yeah.  He was going to Baltimore?  Baltimore.  Baltimore.  Baltimore.  For some with his family.  Was he christening or something?  Yes.  A christening on a Sunday and then he couldn't... 
[00:05:30]  I guess he couldn't make it back.  A three-hour drive.  Yeah.  I've gone to Baltimore.  Three-hour drive.  Three-hour drive.  Well, he chose to take Monday off.  We don't take our days.  We certainly do.  We can't get on him for that.  And he looks like a superstar today.  Yeah.  Right out of the gate.  Because all Sal wanted to do was make sure he didn't put the Friday song on.  And Sal stumbles right out of the gate.  Mm-hmm.  Like in a situation like this, you have to work twice as hard.  But pretend like you worked half as hard.  Right.  So that way you can say, E-Rock, I did your job. 
[00:06:00]  It was so easy.  So easy.  Not, E-Rock, I did your job and I screwed it up within one second of the show starting.  Right, right.  Well, what does Sal have to do for the rest of the show now?  Oh, okay.  That's a great question.  Sal?  He's got to answer the phones.  Oh, phones.  We don't really go to the phones a lot.  Phones.  Oh, Derek's phone is off because everyone turns their phone off.  We probably take five phone calls a show tops.  Yeah.  Right.  And they're going to be really good.  Oh.  Right?  As much as people think we take a lot of phone calls, we really don't.  No.  Well, and then I guess he's going to at some point pull Travis off the board to help 
[00:06:30]  him with the phones.  Right.  We always need some help with those phones.  Yeah.  Sal.  Good old Sal.  Yep.  He's probably going to ask for some help thinking of excuses.  That's true too.  Yeah.  I like how Sal had his excuse though.  It's like, I was at the folder and yeah, that's all.  That's all.  Nothing.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  Like trying to diffuse the whole thing.  Like, what was the problem?  It's like, no, but you fucked it up.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  I fucked up.  That's all that was.  Yeah.  That's all.  Don't worry about it.  I can't blame them though.  It's Jedi mind tricks.  There's no one in charge here.  No.  We went to this place and there's no one in charge.  I don't know what it is.  Like, I mean, we wish they were more involved if they were smart enough to be, you know,  to actually push the show forward.  That would be great.  But it is good that we come in here and we don't see any real bosses.  Yeah.  And then we leave and we don't even know if we're doing good, bad, indifferent.  No one cares.  Don't.  I don't pay much attention.  Thank God we have a pretty good work ethic because we can really fucking call this in. 
[00:07:30]  I'm glad they don't pull a babysitting thing where they are here and they're just like  looking and sitting on us but not really doing anything.  I'd rather they just don't show up and don't do anything.  As much as I beat up Steve, Gary, and Rob, I'm so happy they got the positions they have  because we can walk all over them, which is nice.  Imagine if one of those guys actually knew what they were doing and was connected to  the bigger bosses.  That would be fucked up.  Fuck that.  Fuck that. 
[00:08:00]  So, you know, I keep it right on that level where we don't want to get them fired.  I like that Sal's screw up resulted in you directly insulting upper management.  Or middle management, I should say.  But it's beautiful.  I've been doing this since I was 18.  There's so many fucking nightmare bosses out there that we've been through over the  years.  These guys are a cakewalk.  This is easy.  I'm waiting for the day where everything changes.  We're like, oh, fuck.  That was a good run. 
[00:08:30]  Doesn't middle management just have that sound like, ugh.  Yeah.  Unnecessary.  I'm middle management.  Oh, are you?  Completely unnecessary.  And then the big guy just says, I got it a lot.  I got it.  I got it.  I don't know.  Middle management's like, I'm not quite good enough to make it up upstairs.  Right.  But I've bamboozled my way this far.  Are we getting the new rug yet?  Or are they still discussing that?  What was you thinking?  That's such an easy fix.  They were the ones that said, you want a new rug?  We said, yes. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  So put a new rug in here.  It's going to take a while.  They have to get a certain kind of rug acoustically because of the other ones, the fucking,  it doesn't do enough for the sound.  Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Jimmy starts laughing halfway through that line of shite.  But that thing Sal just pulled as a middle management trick.  Was the rug coming?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The rug's coming, but we didn't get it yet.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  They were supposed to cut our console.  And remember you said you didn't want these screens anymore?  I don't use them.  You never use them, do you?  Don't worry about it. 
[00:09:30]  I could have a tiny monitor for the phones.  I do like seeing who's on the phone.  Sure.  And stuff.  Not a giant screen.  Right.  This could go because I have a laptop that I use.  Right.  And we could push all me forward, cut out even more of this.  We said all that, but they're still discussing that, I guess.  Yeah, we're going to leave it this way.  Don't worry about it.  It's fine.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  It's all good.  It's all right.  How surprised would you be if we walked in on a Monday and everything was completely  how we asked it to be?  I would run to the elevator, run downstairs, run out the building, and turn around real 
[00:10:00]  quickly and look at the name on the building.  Apparently, I had aired and I had entered the wrong place.  Right.  You can't even guarantee that the right intro will work.  Right.  Right.  Yeah, you can't even get the right intro.  Yeah.  And if they did fix the studio how we wanted it, they would be scared like, aw, shit.  Who's in charge now?  Uh-oh.  New people are in charge, obviously.  Uh-oh.  New people are in charge, obviously.  I would think the show was fired.  Right.  I would think a new show had moved in and brought their own console.  Right.  Well, we got canned. 
[00:10:30]  They were the ones that said New Rock.  Okay.  So now what?  Now what?  Could you pick out a new rug within seconds online?  Do you want the Opie and Anthony?  We said no already.  No.  We were like, no, we don't need Opie and Anthony on the rug.  We should get something really impractical, like white shag, that we know we're going  to ruin immediately.  Get it right around winter.  Get it around winter, yeah, where it's just going to be mud and fucking rock salt.  All right.  All right.  We weren't going to start out this way, but Sal sent us down this road.  Thank you.  Sal inspired our first break today. 
[00:11:00]  Uh, we were watching the news right before we went on the air and they're talking about  the three storm troopers that died in Oklahoma, I guess.  Storm chasers.  Not storm troopers.  Not storm troopers.  Jesus.  Storm chasers.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yes.  Um, and they were trying to call them scientists.  That's bullshit.  They're not scientists.  They, they, they collect data and I guess they're scientific in a way, but they were,  uh, they were talking about these guys that they were scientists and it's too bad. 
[00:11:30]  And they're surprised that, you know, such a, such an expert of, uh, what he had 20 years  experience and a few of the other guys, uh, we lost three.  It was, uh, died.  Yeah.  And we're yelling at the TV.  We're like, no, they're thrill seekers.  And they're trying to get that video that we all love watching of this fucking monster.  And we called it sky, uh, a sky monster a long time ago.  These are monsters from the sky.  It's a monster.  If there wasn't such things as tornadoes, let's say tornadoes never existed. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  And you made a movie about a tornado.  Right.  You'd be like, holy fuck.  That is the sickest monster I've ever seen in my life.  Sure.  It's just a wind monster that comes along and scoops you up.  Well, that's why it's tough to believe in the Bible.  Right.  Because, uh, you know, back then, I bet you they called those things monsters.  They were wind monsters.  God's monsters.  Sun monsters.  Rain monsters.  Right.  All kinds of monsters.  That's all they are.  The Lord putteth upon thee.  And you're like, no, it's a fucking rainstorm.  Right.  It was lightning.  Lightning struck somebody. 
[00:12:30]  And the Lord smited him with nine fucking lightning.  No, no.  I was a wind monster.  Don't worry about it.  It's lightning.  Fine.  Uh, but they're trying to say that, uh, their main job is to collect, uh, data.  And they're scientists.  And they're trying to help people by collecting.  They're putting themselves in danger to help humanity by collecting.  No.  No.  Some of that is true, but a very small part of it.  Their main reason to go out there and, and chase these fucking monsters is to get  the cool video that could be on, uh, every news channel. 
[00:13:00]  Much like our own.  And all over YouTube.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Thank you.  We're looking for the viral video out there in the, in the fucking tornado.  All right.  Well.  What?  I failed.  Why?  Maybe I can move to Oklahoma.  You go to Oklahoma.  You are set.  Maybe I could do that.  I did capture a lightning strike on the Hudson River once.  Oh.  That was pretty impressive.  That was pretty cool.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah, but you're right.  They're going for the big video that the news is going to pick up. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  What did he invent?  He invented something like Dorothy, some kind of color or whatever that let him film  from inside the, uh, well, no, what happened, what happened was with this, uh, this storm  chasing, they all started in a, you know, a van or whatever the fuck.  Yeah.  And then it wasn't good enough.  Cause they, they're thinking we got to get even closer.  Yeah.  So now they're, a lot of these guys are riding around in tanks.  Yeah.  They're taking these giant vehicles that they build extremely heavy vehicles that could, 
[00:14:00]  they could withstand shit hitting it.  Yeah.  They were described as tanks on TV.  Why?  Because they want even cooler video and they are collected some of the data.  And of course that's use useful to a point, but to call these guys scientists and they  were doing it just in the name of science.  It's bullshit.  They're, they were thrill seekers first.  They want that big fucking video.  And like you said, the closer you get to it, the better the fucking video is going  to be.  Right.  But you can't get close without get blown away.  So they go, Hmm.  Right. 
[00:14:30]  Let's get a super vehicle, some kind of thing that's engineered to take a tornado.  And then they drive pretty close to these fucking.  Or, or right through it sometimes, depending on the size and whatnot.  Yeah.  And they were also explaining that this storm chasing was something that only a few people  used to do.  But now it is such a hot phenomenon that, that when these tornadoes hit, the roads are  really crowded because everyone is now chasing the storm.  Video cameras.  You said some of these, you know, the guys that are more experienced than others, they, 
[00:15:00]  they see families out there chasing the storms.  And so it's become a family thing.  What, uh, they said the truck was mangled to like wherever they were driving.  Were they in the car when they get killed?  Have you seen any of these videos that, uh, of, uh, of, of, of guys that had did survive?  There's one video.  It looks right out of the movie twister of this land of the one that killed the guy flying  across the road.  And they're getting, they're getting hit with, uh, uh, large objects.  Yeah.  Big like, like their windshields are getting fucking shattered. 
[00:15:30]  Oh my God.  It's crazy.  Houses are coming apart on the side of the road and it's launching debris into the road  and they're driving cause they're trying to get away and shit is hitting their vehicle.  Right.  As they're trying to drive around pieces of houses.  Are these storm chasers or just regular people?  Storm chasers.  Storm chasers.  Right.  Oh, that's not it.  We just lost power right there.  You saw the lights go out.  It's too small.  I need bigger.  Oh boy.  That's bigger.  Right over here on the west side of Tinker.  What is it?  This is just helicopter shit, which is cool too.  Helicopter guys are fucking crazy out in that weather.  You could, you'd be so amazed at how far away they are from that. 
[00:16:00]  If they, if they zoomed all the way out, you'd see that they are so fucking far.  The cameras are amazing.  I was reading some of his posts and he was saying.  It's that car that they got video from, uh, rolling.  200 feet while they were in this car.  Wait, are those guys, uh, alive?  Yeah.  They're the Weather Channel guys.  The Weather Channel guys, uh, went for a roll?  Yeah.  They have a car that actually says Tornado Hunt 2013.  Right.  And they drive around and they got fucked.  Anyway, I mean, and we're talking, uh, real scientists aren't in a vehicle called, uh, 
[00:16:30]  Tornado Hunt 2013.  No.  They're in a fucking van blasting out some Van Halen music.  Bad Van Halen.  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, here.  Okay.  Here's the video.  Look at this.  Wow.  This is the real video.  Yeah.  This is the one that went, uh, viral.  Just shit flying all over the place.  You see the car that went flying by on the left?  Yeah.  Wow.  They're just getting pummeled with pieces of houses.  So drive with Kenny cause he never uses the wipers properly.  Right.  Look at this.  Look at this huge object. 
[00:17:00]  Boom.  Right into the car.  I think that was the one that stopped them, right?  Yeah.  Or did they get going again?  What is that, a tree?  It's a huge tree.  Yeah.  It was a mangled, twisted tree.  Right.  And, uh, a little slow motion, right?  I think so.  Bam.  Oh, that's the shit hitting the windshield.  Shattering it.  That could literally go right through and kill you.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  But it's reinforced windshields.  It's all sorts of shit now.  Oh, that's not a regular windshield?  I'm not sure on this one.  That is, yeah. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, that was just like someone's...  Just someone's car?  Okay.  They...  Just...  Just bouncing off stuff.  Yeah, they went out there with, you know, regular...  Oh, okay.  This is the one I was asking you about.  This guy is scared shitless.  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No!  No! 
[00:18:00]  No!  No!  No!  No!  Yes!  He's a complete freakout mode.  Oh, yeah.  They're like, oh, he fucked this up.  Yes!  It's RFE!  Just go!  Are you okay?  Yes!  Just towards go!  Wow!  Why is he yelling at the guy?  Yeah.  It's RFE.  You're fine.  That's fine, dude.  Just go!  Dusty is driving.  Oh.  Dusty.  Dusty.

Yeah, yeah, that's gotta be scary big wind monster  So it sucks. Those guys lost their lives. Obviously. Yeah, but I think they were thrill-seekers first 
[00:19:00]  That was a guy is 20 years  20 years experience out what the fuck's his name and his son it was him and his son the guy  Yeah, yeah, Tim Samaras and son Paul and their helper Carl young  man, they  Like in twister the guys that you know drove the black SUVs right you got too close  They didn't listen to the extreme and get sucked up in the fucking tornado  Is that what they're called the extreme? No, that was the nickname nickname nickname was the extreme not get over 
[00:19:30]  Semis, you know the extreme once just stood out there in front of a tornado  Yeah, but a bottle naked with a bottle Jack Daniels, right and he juice drinking it  Yeah, and he fucking cursed the tornado. I'm really embarrassed. He threw the bottle of Jack Daniels at the tornado  You know it never hit the ground really is that close he was able to throw it into the tornado  That's crazy naked drinking some Jack drinking some  Dude, he's the extreme was that Phil the extreme was that Philip Seymour Hoffman before he went into rehab 
[00:20:00]  10-day heroin addiction  What it was a 10-day heroin addiction he went to heroin no it was a week  It was a week-long heroin or whatever 10-day heroin addiction. Oh, man.

Was it a shooting? No, no, I didn't know  I didn't know we did heroin for a week to 10 days. Yeah, it was a very short one. I think he just said enough 
[00:20:30]  Anyway, it sucks. Those tornadoes were crazy. I was watching the footage on Friday  Yeah, and everyone was stuck on the highway with the tornado coming imagine that  That's like a disaster movie traffic jam because everyone said fuck this we're getting out of here  Yeah, even and they said that was the worst move  But after what happened in you know more  Oklahoma they're like we're we're not taking a chance we're getting out of here, so it clogged up all the highways and they get stuck out in the open 
[00:21:00]  Right road right surrounded by other cars great, right?  Just bumper to bumper and now you got a tornado that's gonna sweep across some of these roadways, which that's exactly what happened  Like cars? No fucking problem for tornadoes. No man  They just see those piles of cars just back. Oh god. Yeah. Yeah, crazy. That's some I don't understand why they can't build  Like shelters in Oklahoma. They say it's really expensive. Don't they don't they have some show?  It probably happens so fast. There's probably no time to get to them. It's probably one of those things you have 20 minutes notice 
[00:21:30]  That's plenty of time to get into this. You know some kind of  Shelter that you have in your backyard good. No good notice is 15 minutes. They say right all right pretty good  But usually it's 10 or even less, but why is it so expensive to build the shelters? I don't know  I guess you know you can't just plop it somewhere you need the land  And it's got to be built nice nice and strong right got it if you could build a public shelter  There's got to be room for a lot of fucking people, right? I would assume it's probably a bit of public shelters don't seem too safe 
[00:22:00]  I don't know. I just seem too safe in war  It seems like if you could get into a basement of a pretty good structure, you're all right right for the most part, you know  Buildings things like that, but why can't they just have nice basements?  Nice strong basements in Oklahoma. I don't know a lot of these places are in these little  Podunk towns that don't look like they a lot of money pouring into that town, but they say like they buy a house with giant  Basements and shit like that is these flat fucking bottom houses with a root cellar a root cellar 
[00:22:30]  And uh, well, you know these people are busted the answer is coming in because they keep saying how it's just expensive  Yeah, I want to know why it's so expensive when you know this shit's gonna happen every year  Hmm, that's a crazy place to live, but then they wouldn't want to be where there's hurricanes and earthquakes  Everyone you know trades off. Where do you want to live?  What do you want to fucking deal with your home invasions or do you want tornadoes? Yeah? 
[00:23:00]  Everyone has their shit. Yeah, New York City. We had 25 shootings  Over the weekend amazing. I don't know how that happened 25 shootings over the weekend. I'm sure just legal gun owners shooting each other like that  That was crazy over all of us. Do you know every single gun that was used was a legally owned by someone? Wow  All of them only had seven rounds in the magazine because that's all that's allowed now with the new laws that passed. Wow, it's quite amazing. That's unbelievable. Yeah, totally unbelievable  25 shootings how many dead six six six dead one 11 year old girl paralyzed from the neck down, right? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, and again, I I would like to I would like an ethnic fucking reading on all of the um  People that uh did the shootings and were shot because I will guarantee you there is a way way  Disproportionate level of minorities that were shooting each other because there is a fucking problem that no one wants to address. Thank you  I won't get into it, but it's the truth. Who's that guy?  Sam Roberts. He's just anthony's talking to a mirror 
[00:24:00]  I'm mental  By the way, uh before you officially move on from the tornadoes for now  Uh, it's so expensive to build a shelter because the ground is so solid. It's hard to dig up in that area. What I guess  Stop it. I don't know. It's fucking  There's bulldozers and but that's probably what makes it expensive. Oh, you gotta  God bring in the heavy shit, right? What would they use hand shovels? I don't know 
[00:24:30]  Like if you're building something in oatmeal or cement, right?  Bulldozer's a bulldozer. Well, that's why I'm confused by that because they keep saying it's expensive. What's the reason?  I mean, not everyone has hard ground is a moron. I don't know if he's um  I say moron yeah, because when you're building someone if you're building a public  Shelter kevin you're an idiot  You're a moron  The hard ground  All right, you call me you call me moron look have your idiot bitch there look up all the 
[00:25:00]  Why are you getting mad at me? That would be you, Sam. Yeah, that would be you, Sam  Are you a moron? Let the record show that's you. Look it up idiot, bitch  You think  And I guarantee you, that's why it says it, bro. Hard ground  Yeah, it's almost like live, so it's like rock  The whole area is rock?  The ground is so hard, it's like rock. That's why it's so expensive 
[00:25:30]  So why do the tornadoes pick that area?  You have to get demolition teams into two holes, dynamite, all right  Dino-mite  It's the weird, it's really the only place on the earth  It's the only place on earth that gets tornadoes like that  I know  Like there are other places that'll get like, you know, an occasional tornado  But that place of the midwest on the entire planet is the only place that's set up 
[00:26:00]  for that type of weather  Oh, I always thought like tornadoes happen elsewhere as well  Like in the province of Chang'e  Chang'e  Chang'e  province in the  Chang'e  Chang'e  Valley of  Wong  Chua  I just assumed  On the other side of the world has a lot of the same shit we have  It's perfect  We just don't give a fuck about them  It's the weather systems  The way they get the air  Chang'e  Doesn't get the tornadoes?  No, the warmer air from the gulf  Yeah  The colder Canadian air when they collide 
[00:26:30]  The openness between the Rockies and like the Appalachians  You get that very flat kind of land like that  It's perfect  It's the bottom of the scoop  For these monsters  Yeah  It's the bottom of the scoop  Yeah  Pretty amazing  I did not know that until today that that's the only area on the entire planet  Yeah  Yeah, it's pretty cold  I saw a tornado once, but I was never actually in one  But I didn't see one  No, you didn't  All right, let's move on  No  My brother was in one once when he was at Fort Sill  Really? 
[00:27:00]  In Oklahoma, I think  And yeah, he said it was just insane  I can't even imagine  Like the most frightening sound ever  And just like it got ridiculous dark out  At least the hurricane  You have to wait, what, five days?  Yeah, you get a pretty good notice with a hurricane  They'll track that fucking thing  You get plenty of time  Tornadoes, like all of a sudden the sun's out  And then ten minutes later your house is flying away  Right, right  That's got to be scary  It's all fucked  This was a cat four?  Was this a four? 
[00:27:30]  I think so  Well, the one and more lean toward a five, right?  Yeah  Four to five  I'm not sure what this was  I don't know  I'm losing track  There's been so many  Supposedly there were more overnight  I don't know  Have the global warming people come in yet  And said the reason that  We're getting this  They sure have  Meanwhile, if you look back in history  It goes in waves  It's very cyclic  As far as tornadoes  And their ferocity  Over the years  But they'll be like  See? 
[00:28:00]  See?  It's because of global warming  I'm not really sure what to believe  For the record  For the record  I'm really not totally sure what to believe on that one  Weather Channel said it cost $2,500 to do a storm shelter  The problem is not that the soil is hard  Oh, that's not much?  You deal with the hate  Hey, you know, maybe for you  Shut it  You deal with the hate  It's a lot of money for a lot of people, sir  Exactly  Yes, Sam  It appears that the problem is not that the ground is hard 
[00:28:30]  Because that would probably be okay structurally  Are you hard?  Right now?  No  Actually, I'm getting hard  Because that guy called me a bitch idiot  And he was wrong  Yeah, he was  He said, you're a bitch idiot  But he said it's because  It says here a lot of the earth is clay, not soil  So structurally, it doesn't absorb weather and all that stuff  So it's bad  You can't build the same structures in clay that you can build in soil  A lot of people saying the guy who said the ground is too hard is an asshole 
[00:29:00]  I just want the record to show  Right  And another listener that might have been wrong, by the way  Might have been wrong  I love it  I love how they go after each other  That's become a nice pleasure  Great  The wrong listener  That last guy that called, he's a fucking asshole  All right  It happens every time like clockwork  Every time  Every time  You were talking about that girl that was paralyzed from the neck down  Did anyone see, what is that Sunday program? 
[00:29:30]  Is it 60 minutes?  Is it  That's one of them  What's the one that comes on that's always creepy after you're watching your fucking  Sunday morning  No, no  Sunday morning's cool  Sunday morning's relaxing  It's nice  No, that creeps me out  Sunday morning does?  That's easy  That when they go to commercial, there's no music usually  Or it's very light, like fucking funeral parlor music  Right  And they got like the weird sun  Yeah  With the weird face on it  It's like  It's scary  No, that's scary  It goes well with your morning coffee  Very scary  I guess it's 60 minutes 
[00:30:00]  You get excited about your team  It's a great sporting event  And then this fucking thing comes on  Yeah, the ticking  And then it's always some horrendous thing  It's all fun until the ticking starts  It just fucks up your mood  Yeah  If you don't change the channel quick enough  Yep  But last night  Oh, there it is  Okay  Last night  Because you were talking about the 11-year-old that's paralyzed from the neck down  Yeah  They have this breakthrough that is so fucked up  The robotic limbs  Did you see this last night?  Man  You can move robotic limbs with your mind 
[00:30:30]  It's called mind control  And they were showing a lady do it  And then the reporter  They allowed him to like try to diffuse a fake bomb by pulling out a wire  By just using his mind with a robotic arm  Really?  It was so fucked up  Limbs on the battlefield  And that fact led the Department of Defense to start a crash program  To help veterans and civilians  By creating an artificial arm and hand  That are amazingly human 
[00:31:00]  But that's not the breakthrough  We don't use that word very often  Because it's overused  But when you see how they have connected this robotic limb to a human brain  You'll understand why we made the exception  As we reported last December  To take this ultimate step  They had to find a person willing to have brain surgery  To explore new frontiers of what it is to be human  That's ballsy  That person would have to be an explorer  Not really  She's pretty fucked up  Oh okay  Remarkable courage 
[00:31:30]  Oh there you go  And maybe most of all  No arm  That is gain  The gain  Pause pause this  It's a warm piece  She was on  She was on  Wheel of Fortune  Wheel of Fortune  And then her life  Is that how her arm came off?  No  She spun the wheel too hard  And I said no  What an idiot  Oh no  She was on  Free spin  Because her arm is laying across  She was on Wheel of Fortune  And then she got this horrendous fucking disease 
[00:32:00]  That's why 60 Minutes is so creepy  Oh no  You learn about another disease  That could just take you out  What disease takes your arm?  No  No  It took her whole body  Oh  Nothing moves on her  Wait is she paralyzed?  She is a head basically  Oh my god  But now she's like  Using this robotic arm  And she says  It feels like she's  Moving her actual arm  This is  This is one of the most amazing things  I've seen on TV  In a long fucking time  And the potential here  Is ridiculous  Yeah  Like I said  We're all gonna have  Our body parts remade 
[00:32:30]  You know Ray Kurzweil and myself  Theorize  Oh  That uh  See that's the next step  Nobody wants to listen to me  We listen to future Jimmy  We laugh  But we listen  You wanna go down this road  It's a little long  I'd love to know  Alright we can  It's pretty amazing  I'm sure we can fast forward  Through some of the shit  But  Alright  Let's hit this  It's up to  The person they chose  Is Jan Sherman  Dee  A Pittsburgh mother of two  And writer  With a mind  Nimble enough  To match wits  On The Wheel of Fortune 
[00:33:00]  In 1995  Pause  It's an easy one  Pause  You saw that too  It's a puzzle  She has to try to figure out  Too cute for words  And the only letters  Missing is a U  And an S  Yeah  Yeah yeah  The U in cute  And the S in words  What special talents  Exactly  Her sharp mind  What  Who is she against  Too co-taped for wordles  No wrong  Right  C-blank 
[00:33:30]  T-E  For  W-O-R-D  Blank  And they're calling her  Brilliant basically  She's a fucking genius  Fucking idiot  It's too cute for wordy  That's what it is  Oh no  It's wordy  Words  You're wordy  For words  Yes  When her mind triumphed  Her brain sent signals of delight  To every muscle in her body  But a year after this moment  Oh no 
[00:34:00]  Those brain signals  Were being cut off  Oh no  One day I had trouble  In the evening  I was making a lot of trips  In and out of the car  It felt like my legs  Were dragging behind me  Oh no  Within two years  Oh  A genetic disease  Called spinocerebellar degeneration  Oh my god  Broke the connection  Between brain and body  Oof  Now at age 53  Jan Sherman can move only  The muscles in her face  And a few in her neck  She's dependent on a caregiver  For nearly all of her daily needs 
[00:34:30]  Everything  52 across  And her mother  To help her solve the puzzles  She loves  Healed  Oh  Oh you're good  At the same time  Jan Sherman was putting her mind  To a new life  A neuroscientist  Just across town  At the University of Pittsburgh  Was imagining how people like Jan  Might be restored  Andy Schwartz  On the right  Is working on an ambitious  Defense department project  Called 
[00:35:00]  Revolutionizing prosthetics  Defense department  Five years ago  We visited his lab  And Schwartz  Showed us how he implanted  Tiny sensors like this one  Into the brains  Of monkeys  And wired them to a crude  Robotic arm  Schwartz told us  That when the monkey  Thinks about moving  His own arm  His brain cells  Or neurons  Fire off  Electrical signals  The sensor  In his brain  Can pick up  These signals  And send them  To the robot  Pausing  So he's operating 
[00:35:30]  The arm  It's all electricity  It's easy  The monkey just goes  Give me that  And the fucking arm  Goes alright  Whatever  It's Sal's explanation  The monkey goes  Boom  He gets the thing  No biggie  If the monkey thinks  Of putting in  The Monday morning intro  Right  The arm grabs  For the Friday intro  So there's obviously  A synapse firing  Which needs to be  Fixed to the hammer  They're showing a monkey  With his arms tied down  With a robotic arm 
[00:36:00]  And the monkey's just thinking  He needs the food  And the robotic arm  Is going and getting it  And then bringing it  To his mouth  That's crazy  That's fucked up  That is fucking crazy  In three dimensions  Up, down, forward, and back  As well as the gripper  Well what you're telling me  Is that the monkey  Is operating this arm  With nothing but his thoughts  Absolutely  What are the chances  That a human being  Would be able to  Build the arms  And all they grab  For are bananas  Yeah  And decks  Throw shit  Throw your arms 
[00:36:30]  That was five years ago  The 150 million dollar  Revolutionizing prosthetics program  Has reached farther  Than most thought possible  Damn  Awesome  Dr. Jeffrey Ling  Looks like a  Herbie Hancock video  Yeah  If we're gonna do this  We gotta do it properly  So then they showed  It looks like he's a soldier  Right?  An old soldier  And he's just standing  And there's a robotic arm  In like some kind of like  Cup or something  And the guy is trying  To pick up the cup  Just using his mind 
[00:37:00]  Uh huh  And he was able  To accomplish that task  How fucked up is this?  That's pretty fucked  Did you know  They were working on this shit?  I didn't know  They were working  Where they actually  Implant sensors  In your fucking brain  Right  I know that they  For a few years  They've had sensors  That go on your arms  Like on your stump  And they find out  Where the nerves  Right  Were that would actually  Control your hand  Right  And they put sensors on it  So when you try to move  The non-existent hand  The energy is still  Going down those nerves  Right  It just stops 
[00:37:30]  Where the limb stops  But they would take that  And translate it into  Movement  Right  Of the limb  But this is fucked up  Right from the brain  Right  Then you can think  Like instead of  Your arm going  Okay  You know  I have to move my arm  And consciously think about it  You might just go  Oh I want that  And your arm  Your mechanical arm  Will now grab it  And do everything it needs to  I always wonder  What happened to the  Guys in biology class  That I used to cheat off  Uh yeah  Here they are  Here they are  See they're leaving out  Though you have to  Actually say to it  Arm forward 
[00:38:00]  And it's very  Unconvenient  How annoying  Grip  Arm back  Lift  You'd think they would  Fix that  Tilt  Come up with a better  Interface than  Yelling at your limb  Because what happens  Is when you're drinking  Your coffee  You don't know how to  Stop it  Because when you go  You have coffee  In your mouth  Yeah when your mouth  Is full what happens  Colonel and neurologist  Is in charge  After seeing the wounded 
[00:38:30]  On several tours  In Iraq and Afghanistan  He told his team  That he wanted a breakthrough  Within five years  Did any of them say  Look colonel  We're not sure  We can do this  He'd be off  Oh absolutely  They thought that  We were crazy  But that's quite alright  Because I think  It's in our insanity  That things happen  That madness  Led to genius  In labs  All across the country  Look at that  Hand is cool  At the applied physics  Laboratory  At Johns Hopkins  University in Maryland 
[00:39:00]  Michael McLaughlin  Led the multi-million dollar  Engineering  Of what has become  The most sophisticated  Hand and arm  Ever developed  That's crazy looking  It's the same size  And weight  Of an average man's  Arm and hand  Do you have a rock?  Would he use this  For a jacking off?  Including the computers  And the battery  God  Is there anything  Very articulated  Your natural arm  And hand  Can do  That the mechanical  Hand can't  Well I can do this  Star Trek  I live long and prosper 
[00:39:30]  But other than that  Virtually everything  Your natural hand  Can do  That this prosthetic  Is able to do  Same strength  Same strength  Why not make it  Fucking crazy strength  Well you know  That's what's gonna  Happen next  Someone's gonna  Modify their  Fucking  That looks cool  Where no human  Can go  Stop  Robots  We wore a visor  That showed us  The video feed  From the robot  These gloves  Move the robotic  Hand  Pulling a wire 
[00:40:00]  Out of a bomb  Come on  Give me that pinch  There you go  Awesome  Wow  But the holy grail  In the project  Was finding a way  To connect the robot  Directly to the brain  Whoa  Who wouldn't want to do this  Back to the front  I heard about  Oh god  Oh  Absolutely  I couldn't  Not  Old rolling blunder  In 2012  Jan Sherman  Put her  Oh no  Poor woman  Wheel  Of  There's a B  Oh no 
[00:40:30]  Space  An R  A D  Oh no  Poor lady  It's not even her fault  I know  But  That's terrible  Now they're wheeling her in  To get the surgery  So they can connect  Man and machine  Electrodes  In her brain  I was blown away  By this piece  We don't have to do  The whole thing  I want to sit  You sure  Yeah  I was sitting there  I couldn't believe it  Dude this is a  This is a miracle of science  Yeah  It really is  Amazing  Yes  What strength she has to  As a person  To can  Because I would just say 
[00:41:00]  Let me die  If I couldn't move  Below the neck  Like what people have  A lot of fucking  Inner strength  I don't think I have  I just realized  I gotta start making friends again  Because god forbid  This happens to me  Who's gonna help me  With the sudoku puzzle  Is this Sam  Helping you  We saw that lady  There was the New York Times  Crossword puzzle  And she's sitting there  Doing  Yeah  Doing all the  Heavy lifting  Terrible  Alright they're wheeling her  Into the hospital  For the surgery here  And we'll see  What happens next  Dolph on the line 
[00:41:30]  For a more sophisticated  Version of the surgery  They had done earlier  In the monkeys  There's a  Hey hey  Brain surgery involved  It's experimental  Why were you so excited  About it  Look at me  Dummy  I've always believed  There's a purpose  To my illness  I didn't think  I would ever find out  What it was  In my lifetime  And  She's gasping for breath  That's probably hard  For her to breathe  All the muscles  That it takes to breathe  Where they needed me  You know  They couldn't just  Pick a Tom, Dick 
[00:42:00]  Or Harry  Off the street  Then  In a few years  The  I'm having a trouble  I'm watching her breathe  The Department of Defense  Is funding some of it  For the vets  To be of use to them  In service to them  What an honor  What I'm going to do right now  Is I'm just making some marks  Here in your hair  Oh boy  The procedure was done  It's just a lady dying  Yeah  The University of Pittsburgh  Neurosurgeon  Elizabeth Tyler Cabara  Who showed us  That the area  That controls  Hand and arm movement  Is accessible  Right on the surface 
[00:42:30]  Of the brain  Nice  What are the dangers  We worry about  If we were to accidentally  Tear a blood vessel  While we were putting them in  That we could cause  A blood clot  That would collect  On the surface of the brain  Probably the thing  We worry about the most  Is the possibility  Of infection  She's crazy  I do have  The brain's not working  Through the skull  To the outside  Absolutely  Nothing to lose  May I  Applause just a little  Sam  I don't want to see  I don't know about you 
[00:43:00]  Wide open skull  But I don't think  I would let a woman  Who better for brain surgery  Who better at being  Tinkering around in somebody's brain  Than a woman  Right  Without making an incision  Oh yeah  Believe me  She just fucking  Talked the cells  In a woman properly  Oh god damn  Is she awake for this?  The woman might be awake for this  A lot of times  People are awake for certain  Brain surgery  Oh my god  There's a big  Big chunk of her skull  Taken out  There's the surface 
[00:43:30]  Of the brain  Yeah  And they're  Putting sensors in there  Yes they are  There's no pain sensors  On your brain  So when they operate  They have to numb your head  But your brain  They don't need to numb  That's crazy  That is crazy  During the six hour surgery  Two sensor arrays  Each the size of a pea  Were placed on the surface  Of Jan's brain  Then they were wired  To two computer connections  Called pedestals 
[00:44:00]  The gateways to Jan's thoughts  They're on her head  People are going to look  At those pedestals  In your skull  And they're going to think  That has to hurt  Is it painful?  Has it been difficult  In any way?  For a few hours  After I woke up  I had the worst case  Of virus remorse  I was thinking  Oh my god  I had brain surgery  Why didn't anyone  Stop me?  Why didn't they say  Jan you're crazy?  But as soon as  The headache went away  That kind of talk  Went away too  Five months 
[00:44:30]  After the surgery  We came back  To see whether  She would be able  To be able to control  The robotic arm  With nothing but her thoughts  Yep  They plugged her brain  Into the computer  Now remember  She can't move  Whatsoever  I can move it up  She's moving this  Robotic arm  With just her brain  And left and right  And diagonally  I can close it  And open it  And I can go forward  And back  That's her brain  That is just the most  Astounding thing I've ever seen  Can we shake hands 
[00:45:00]  Sure  No really  Yeah  I should rip his arm off  And beat him with it  Okay  She's shaking his hand  By just using her mind  Press your hand  There we go  Oh my goodness  She's breaking his hand  Wow  And I can do a fist bump  If you'd like  That's amazing  And I can rub my clitoris  With this finger  Finally  In your mind  As you're moving  This arm around  What are you thinking  Okay  The best way to explain it  Is raise your arm 
[00:45:30]  Uh huh  Good  Now what did you think  About when you did that  Well not very much  I do it all the time  Exactly  It's automatic  Is that hard  Are you having to concentrate  No  It was hard work  Getting there  I struggle greatly  To go up and down  At the beginning  Now up and down  So we don't even think  About it  Side to side  Don't even think about it  Just like  Just like that  Your arms used to  Wow  She'll be able to eat  And everything  We asked Dr. Ling  The program manager  Fuck  Where all of this is headed  I'm old enough 
[00:46:00]  To have watched  Neil Armstrong  Take that step on the moon  And to watch  Never happened  Jan do that  I had the same tinkers  Because I realized  That we have now  Stepped over  A great threshold  Between what is possible  And very importantly  What patients can now expect  In terms of restoration  This is a very important part  Not rehab  But restoration  Of function  I wonder what  Wow  Your experience with Jan  Has taught you  About the brain  And the brain's ability  To adapt  To new circumstances 
[00:46:30]  I think it's taught me  Something really fundamental  They've got to go with  Wi-Fi  And that is  Eventually yeah  And our arms  And our legs  Are just tools  For our brain  And so when we give  Another tool  Sounds a tool  In Jan's case  A robot arm  She will adapt  To that tool  To do the things  That she wants to do  Of course  Many who could use  A robot arm  Are not paralyzed  Like Jan  They're amputees  And for them  The project  Has found a way  To connect the arm  Without brain surgery 
[00:47:00]  58 year old  Johnny Mathney  Lost his arm  To cancer  Dr. Albert Chi  From Johns Hopkins  Hospital  Found nerves  That used to go  To Johnny's hand  And move them  To muscles  In his remaining limb  Now  Elbow extension  Sensors on his skin  Pick up the brain  Signals from the nerves  And use those signals  To control the robotic arm  He's got it on  Right  Here I want to see you  So even though  The limb is missing 
[00:47:30]  The brain still sends  The signals  As if the limb  Was still there  Correct  Johnny  It feels  In your mind  Like your hand  Is there again  Yes  Wow  As if  As if your arm  Had never been lost  Correct  Unlike Jan  The connection  For Johnny  Runs both ways  Sensors in the finger  Send signals back  So he can feel  What he's touching  Get the fuck  Out of here  You can close on it  Yeah 
[00:48:00]  He's not looking at it  We put him to the test  Hard or soft  Soft  Correct  You can't see what he's holding  Very good  Now let's try again  I'm holding the object  This is dick  Yeah  Soft  Exactly  I know  It was a problem  He got it right  Every time  Hard or soft  He only had two options  It was a bowling ball  And a balloon  And he would float  Above the thing  The next person  To have Jan's surgery  Will have additional  Sensors placed in the brain  To receive the sensation 
[00:48:30]  Of touch  Oh wow  Andy Schwartz believes  That will help  With some of the things  That Jan has trouble with  For example  Clumsy bitch  Sometimes when she looks  Right at an object  She can't grab it  Okay I'm going to take  The cone away  Just go ahead and close it  For sure  No problem  So as soon as I take  The cone away  There's no problem  But as soon as I put  The cone there  She can't do it  That's weird  Why  Is still a mystery  Fucking mystery  The progress is coming rapidly  They're working on a wireless version 
[00:49:00]  Of the implant  To eliminate the connection  In the skull  Oh those skull connections  Are bizarre  That the lab experiments  Will one day  Enter the real world  She's feeding herself  Two giant  Nubs on her head  I think that it's going  To open the wave  For things like  Sight and sound  And my dream  My dream that  We'll be able to  Take this into  All sorts of patients  Patients with stroke  That's impossible  And the elderly  I think when  Other quadriplegics 
[00:49:30]  See what I'm doing  With the arm  They're all going to say  Oh wow  I wish I could do that  Well  Slow down  Awesome  Thank you so much  The way they use  Your real arm  For that stuff  Eventually you'll be able  Just to use your real arm  I'm sure  Yeah what do you mean  Oh  Pick up cookies  You'll have to use  You'll have to use  A robot arm  Right  If you're paralyzed  It'll be able to  Restore something  Which stimulates your real arm  That just blew me away  That's amazing  Last night  Pretty amazing  And they're just  At the beginning of it 
[00:50:00]  That poor girl  That was shot in New York  That little 11 year old girl  Was shot by that  Fucking animal  You know  In a whatever  Gang shooting  Of course  So at least  You know  She's 11  She'll have some shit times  But hopefully  By the time  She's an adult  She probably has a chance  At something like this  A viable way to live  Inner city girl  She ain't getting shit  She's getting a fucking wheelchair  And shoved into the fucking projects  Yeah  You're probably right  People don't give a fuck  We got a guy  Who has a sister-in-law  That has one of these arms  Bill in South Carolina 
[00:50:30]  Bill  Hello Bill  Hey guys  Hey Matt  My sister-in-law  Got in a car wrecking  And she lost her left arm  Just below the elbow  And she got one of those arms  That actually picks up  The sensors in her stump  And can control the hands  She can pick things up  And you know  It's not 100%  But it's kind of creepy  To watch it  Because it's  The way it works  It's not real smooth  Like your regular hand  It's kind of mechanical looking  But it doesn't work  Yeah but fast forward  Like five years 
[00:51:00]  It's going to be amazing  Yeah you won't even know  This isn't the beginning  Of this shit  Yeah  Yeah she has to put  Like a sock on that stuff  And it's got holes  In certain places  In the sock  And then when the  Prosthetic goes on  It's got a sensor  That goes  Touches the skin  Right through that hole  And she can just  Make it move  With her brain  We grew up with a kid  Whose father had  A missing arm  Hook  All he had was the hook  And now look  What they're up to  He had this weird hook  And then he had something  That kind of looked  A little nicer  If he went out  And the hook  With the  That you would open 
[00:51:30]  And close  I don't even think  He had the open  And close thing  It just was this  This hook  So he could kind of  Slide things toward him  I guess  That was a  I know they had  Like a mechanical device  With the hook  Where there was a hook  But the hook was split  So it would move  Right  And it was run by a cable  That was attached  To your shoulder  And you had to literally  Like move your shoulder up  Okay  And it would pull the cable  And open it  And close it  Oh I see  So you just kind of  Do something  Yeah  Like a drawbridge  Yeah yeah  There was nothing electronic  About it whatsoever  And now we just saw  A hand 
[00:52:00]  Where every  Like  Oh man  Every little move  I was going to say  Every muscle  But you know what I'm saying  Every knuckle  Has a joint on it  Unbelievable  Wait till they can put  Flesh around it  Through like these printers  They're making  These 3D printers  Uh oh  They're making human cells  Wait till that  Just like the Terminator  When that goes  Wrap flesh around the Terminator  Right  You want to be able to know  The first thing will be  You can see people's  Weird movements  Their arms will look weird  But it will look real  But the movement will be weird  So that's how you'll tell  Really  And then a few years from that  You won't even be able to tell  Their eyes will glow red  And dogs will bark at them 
[00:52:30]  Because that's the Terminator  That's what happened  You'll always know  Because they always lose  The pop lock competitions  Because they can't get  This smooth like  That little break dance move  But the robot  Oh the robot  They're amazing  They rule at the robot  Yeah  That's pretty fucking amazing man  Yeah  Wasn't there a reason  They want to slow down  The whole robot thing  Because they're really  Starting to get scared  Of the potential  Really?  And what the robots  Could do  Oh yeah the UN right  Someone  People in the UN  Were saying like  Eh enough with the robots  Yeah let's slow this 
[00:53:00]  Technology down a little bit  Eh gotta keep rocking  Because the potential  Is crazy there  I mean look at that arm  You can modify that  To make you know  Make it crush it  Easily  People love robots  That look like people  It's like you know  There are robots  That do plenty of things  In the workplace  In industry and stuff  You know a car  Manufacturer's been using  For years  They spin around  They grab something  They weld it  They fuck it  But they don't look like people  When you have a humanoid  Figure looking robot  That's when people go like  Holy fuck 
[00:53:30]  Why don't you have a robot yet?  I don't know  I don't think I need one  I was in a restaurant once  In Huntington  And this guy had a robot dog  It was kind of fucking cool  Really?  A robot dog  And that's about 10 years ago  Wow  But it did some shit  Where you're like  That's fucking cool  Robot dog  Yeah he would bring it  Into his one restaurant  Just to kind of show off  It's got peanut butter  I wrote a show called Robot Boy  Starring myself  As a boy who's a human 
[00:54:00]  Looks like a human  But is a robot  And my heart becomes human  Sounds like a few things  It's Robot Boy  No I'm Robot Boy  AI  I never saw those  Which is where they try to teach me  That being human  It means having a heart  And I don't get it  The first thing  Was it a boss?  It's quite a few  You don't think Robot Boy  Is going to be a good show?  No  It's not  I'll hit the wrong button 
[00:54:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  Will return in a moment  After all  Millions have to piss too  Next week  On a very special  Opie and Anthony show  The sex bagel  Battles his demons  Everything could be  Everything could be saved  If you come in and take a shot  When he throws a celebration  For himself  Tequila day was my idea  But when things go wrong

[00:58:30]  Got a big day. Kevin Smith coming in to say hi. 
[00:59:00]  Our pal.  Something about Superman.  Shaving? What?  No, I don't know. I have no idea.  Superman shaves his pubes.  How does Superman shave?  I got my new razors from ShaveClub.com.  Oh, did you?  DollarShaveClub.com.  They're sending me razors every fucking week now.  I'm loving it.  I mean, we're not even doing the live read right now, right?  This is the greatest thing ever.  And I know we trashed them at first because I thought it was so stupid.  Did we?  I did. I should speak for myself. I did. 
[00:59:30]  And then I tried the product.  And, I mean, every... Look.  Look at you.  Every week you get four more blades.  Yeah.  And then you get a little shaved butter.  Ooh.  Perfect.  Monthly.  Huh? Oh, is it monthly?  Yeah, it's not weekly.  I think I'm getting it weekly because I'm getting everyone else's.  Oh, okay.  But monthly, whatever.  Weebly would just be silly.  Bob Levy, uh...  All right.  Is he there?  Is he gone? 
[01:00:00]  He wanted to talk about the video we just saw, but we're kind of moving on from that, aren't we?  Yeah.  Wait, he's back.  Hold on a minute.  Bob Levy.  Yes, I'm pretty much an expert on prosthetic arms, and there you are very hard to tell.  Because I was... I fucked a girl with one arm, and I had no idea if she had one arm.  Because what they do is they fucking... they stay on the opposite side of you when you're  walking, holding hands. 
[01:00:30]  So you have no fucking idea.  I banged her four times and had no idea she had a fucking rubber hand.  You're kidding.  It was an arm.  It's like the...  I swear to God.  Remember the chick that...  Yes, I do remember.  The slot machine we called her?  And we've met her so many times before we even realized.  Yeah.  The famous...  You don't notice, because they put a ring on it.  You know what I mean?  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  No, she had a bracelet on.  She had a bracelet.  She worked for a big news organization. 
[01:01:00]  They were doing their big Opie and Anthony piece when we were really hot many, many years  ago, and she was coming in as a producer, hanging out with us for, I don't know, a week or two,  and then she was partying with us, and she went to one of our signings, and that's when  we finally, after knowing her for a couple of weeks, I noticed for the first time, and  I went to Anthony and I tapped my arm like we're going to call in the left-hander, and  he goes, what the fuck are you doing?  And he looked over at her and noticed for the first time, too, that she had a fake arm  the entire time she was hanging out with us. 
[01:01:30]  That was crazy.  I was hanging out with Sparky Lyle.  Right.  But the whole thing is, I fucked this girl for something.  This is when I was drinking, and I had no idea.  We're going up to do this gig, me and Artie Lang, and he goes, are you bringing the girl  with the one arm again?  And I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Oh, shit.  I had no fucking idea.  That's crazy.  I had her arms pinned back.  I had them like, you know when you pin them back?  Right.  And I had no fucking idea until she came to Vegas with us, and she took a shower, and  it was hidden under a towel, and she kicked the fuck out of me when I moved it down. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, Bob, did you have an idea?  I had no fucking idea that she had an idea.  Yeah, that's nuts, man.  That is crazy.  It's scary shit, because I mean, I don't even know if she gave me a hand job, how that  would have felt.  You know?  You would have felt that.  I don't know the feeling.  But even the thing with, like, the pirate hand you were talking about, I mean, they  should have just had the ones, like, on Lost in Space, like the robot had. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, right, with the little pincers.  Exactly.  Just pincers.  Yeah.  But, you know, hey, girls with one arm, they can fuck, too.  They're just as good.  They can fuck, too.  All right, Bob.  Thank you, sir.  Have a good day, everyone, guys.  See you, buddy.  Bob, leave me, everyone.  Girls with one arm, hey, they can fuck, too.  There you go.  That is a great campaign for girls with one arm.  It really is.  Yeah, don't forget us, guys.  We can fuck, too.  Oh, what's this, Sal? 
[01:03:00]  I don't know if Sal's coming in with something.  Oh, wow.  By the way, tomorrow, Doc Gooden's coming in.  Wow.  And then on Wednesday, Ethan Hawke and David Lee Roth.  Wow.  And then Thursday, and I think Friday, Jay Moores.  Whoa.  Jay was writing me over the weekend, so he's coming Thursday and Friday.  And let's not forget, podcast number three, Opie and Anthony, podcast number three, available  right now.  With the fourth one getting ready to be available, what, Wednesday? 
[01:03:30]  Every Wednesday is Opie and Anthony podcast day.  All right.  Please subscribe so we get the fake numbers, right?  Fake numbers.  Oh, we don't care if you listen to the damn thing, but you subscribe, we get the credit.  It's all about numbers.  It's all about the numbers.  Anyway.  We know that.  I would like to appeal to the fans for something.  Oh, you're very appealing.  I'm a, oh, Anthony.  You're blushing now.  Yeah.  I did the debate on Kamau Bell on Thursday.  Was it a mask debate?  Jesus.  With a woman named Lindy West. 
[01:04:00]  She's a feminist blogger.  And she had written a big article about white guys doing rape jokes.  You know, you read it, you get irritated, of course, because I'm a white guy.  Sure.  But it wasn't directed at me.  So we debated, and we had a good debate.  It aired for five minutes, and the unedited 16-minute version, FX, promised me they'd put  up, and they did.  Twelve hours later, it was online.  They were very fast about putting that up.  Can I ask you why the race angle had to be in there? 
[01:04:30]  Like, why white guys?  Well, that's why she wrote that.  I had my own theory.  I didn't even get into that with her, because it was just so much to talk about with just  the humor.  It didn't even, we didn't talk much about her particular, what she had written.  I think she did it because she sees white males as the, you know, the privilege.  You know, it's irritating when you hear it.  But to the debate that she and I had, she's not the only one that feels this way.  Like, you know, there's a lot of women or feminists or people who feel like she feels. 
[01:05:00]  So people are like, how did you keep your cool?  Well, because I'm just debating a point.  Like, what do I do?  Yell at her.  And then, okay, like, let's say I yell at her.  Well, there's fucking 800,000 other people that I have to yell at.  It's like, you're debating the point.  And she was actually fairly nice off camera.  We chatted, and I enjoyed chatting with her.  And so we have this debate.  It goes up.  And a lot of people have seen it.  It went up Friday morning, like 36 hours ago.  It's got like 150,000 views already.  Damn. 
[01:05:30]  That's nice.  It's not like it's fucking, you know, size video, but it's something.  But that's really nice.  People who are, you can attack her opinion.  And yeah, I don't agree with her opinion.  But this guy's writing stuff like, you know, like, because we debated rape jokes, you know,  she should get raped, and it's like, I don't tell people what to write or how to tweet.  I don't like to do that.  I hate that thought policing shit.  Yeah.  But come on.  I mean, at least just go after the opinion.  That doesn't really make a, yeah. 
[01:06:00]  Because you're not helping anything by doing that.  Like, she's not dumb.  Uh-huh.  And she's not as knee-jerk reaction as people think.  Like, believe me, I don't like her opinion.  I fucking disagree with it.  Yeah.  But she's not saying if you do rape jokes, you should never be allowed to perform again.  And, you know, you gotta, if you come back and go, it's free speech!  She ain't debating free speech.  Uh-huh.  She's not saying you shouldn't have the right to say it.  But guys debate the wrong thing.  What about the, you know, Constitution?  Oh, boy. 
[01:06:30]  It's not the Constitution.  She's not saying...  Her point is what?  That...  Her point was a bit scattered because...  You shouldn't make rape jokes?  Is that it?  She said...  And I understand why she's saying what she's saying.  I just don't agree.  Uh-huh.  Is that she's...  The word...  The term rape culture is thrown around a lot.  And look, maybe...  Maybe if someone explains exactly what it is, maybe that we are...  Uh...  A little rapey?  Yeah.  Possibly.  I do not think humor contributes to that.  Her point is basically, when you do rape jokes, she's like, go ahead, do rape jokes. 
[01:07:00]  I don't care.  But do them where you don't make the victim the punchline.  And I understand that's not an unreasonable request.  Um...  I wouldn't honor it because...  Of course not.  You know, like...  I...  You know, David Tell, I've seen, who's a comic genius, do jokes with a victim.  And I've done jokes with a victim as the punchline.  Yeah.  And I'm not going to apologize for that because sometimes in a misdirection joke, the most  obscene or absurd option is what the joke is.  Right, right, right.  Like, I was doing one dumb joke, which I filmed in a special. 
[01:07:30]  And again, this didn't come up.  I'm just mentioning.  Where the punchline was...  I didn't...  At the concert, the girl grabbed my dick and I'm like, I never saw her again.  And I don't know if she enjoyed the show or if she was gang-raped in a port-a-potty.  Right.  And the reason I say that is, A, I like the terminology, gang-raped in a port-a-potty.  Sure.  I don't like the image of it.  But in a joke form, to me, the words...  Just those words...  Well, it's more of a punch in the face than...  It's a...  Yeah, yeah.  A verbal.  Right.  But the funny part of that is that the options...  When you're giving two options... 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if she had a good time or if she went home and went to bed.  That's the logical way people talk.  Right.  I don't know if she had a great time or really didn't enjoy the show.  There's nothing funny about that.  Nothing, right.  Because the options are not one degree and 500 degrees.  Exactly.  So sometimes you have to go the most barbaric route.  I'm explaining jokes.  But it's a good thing you are because you're obviously arguing or discussing this with a woman that has a point but has no concept of joke-telling. 
[01:08:30]  Doesn't understand that that is part of humor.  That, you know, yeah, here's the normal, everyday thinking.  Here's so far out of the realm of thinking and that's what makes it funny.  She doesn't understand that's what makes things funny.  I think she understands that.  No, I really do.  Yeah.  But just doesn't agree with it.  Like, I think she understands that and I'm not going to speak for her but says, like, hey, I get that but, you know, raise your art and don't do it.  Right.  I just, I won't honor that.  Not because I don't care about rape victims. 
[01:09:00]  I'm a fucking blubbering douche.  Like, mocking something, even relentlessly, doesn't mean that you don't love it or don't care about it or don't feel.  So we just look at certain things with comedy a lot differently.  I take zero responsibility for people's barbarism because I don't commit piggish acts like that and I don't want any credit for their good behavior.  Right.  So anyway, if you're going to criticize her, hey, do what you want to do.  You want to tell her to get raped, that's up to you.  But, you know.  You'd appreciate some intelligence. 
[01:09:30]  Honestly, because.  Inject some intelligence into your comments.  Because for what, there's no, and the reason people don't really want her to get raped.  What people would do, if we were arguing about scat porn, people would be going, I hope you get shit on you.  Like, it's just because that's what we're talking about.  But go after her point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're going to tweet her or go after her on YouTube, fine.  But go after the point or, you know, because she can defend her point, even though I don't agree with this.  But again, I'm saying this for you.  She's not a dummy. 
[01:10:00]  People, a lot of times, we react emotionally.  And I've been guilty of that in my life.  Where you see something happening, and I don't want to formulate what I'm trying to say because I'm being emotionally lazy.  So I'm like, ah, fuck it, just die.  I've been guilty of that, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But that's what this is.  People are coming at her kind of in, they're just reacting or they're being a bit emotionally lazy.  It's like, think your thought through.  Don't be afraid that if you say what you want to say, she's going to have a smarter answer than you.  Hey, if she does, she does. 
[01:10:30]  But make your point smartly.  Right.  And to answer your question, the whole white guy thing, we didn't talk about that on Kamau Bell because it wasn't where we went with the discussion.  We didn't harp on what she wrote.  I think it would hurt her attack, and I think that she should have attacked shit comedy in what she wrote because I think she would have gotten a lot more people actually seeing her point.  Right, right, right.  Than if she just attacked gay white guys.  There's a lot of white guys that do great rape jokes.  And by not attacking the pimp culture or any of that stuff, to me it's a very soft and risk-free attack, believe it or not. 
[01:11:00]  Was she an African-American woman?  No, no, no.  She's a white woman.  She's a white woman?  I just didn't.  Hi, buddy.  We're talking about the blogger who wrote, Lindy West, who wrote the thing on rape jokes, and I debated her on Kamau Bell.  So now the fans are attacking her and saying, I hope you get raped.  That's crazy.  And it's like, again, I don't tell people, don't say that, guys, because I say horrible shit, but you're not helping the cause, and she's not some dumbbell who is saying that comedians should be arrested. 
[01:11:30]  So don't address it.  Like, if she was saying, hey, if you do a rape joke, you should not be allowed to do comedy ever, I'd say fucking take the gloves off and be barbaric.  But I don't, I'm almost not understanding what her point even is then.  Like, you're saying her point isn't, you should stop doing that.  Like, what, her point was just, hey, in my opinion, I don't find it funny.  That's not much of a debate, really.  Well, she's performed stand-up.  You know, she does the thing, because she's fat, and she did a thing on being fat, and then dealing with people who attack her online for being fat. 
[01:12:00]  And I saw this stand-up thing she did, and it was actually thoughtful.  And, you know, look, I'm not saying she's Joan Rivers at this point.  But she's, you can see that she's got something funny to say, and she's got, like, I liked her more than I thought I would.  And she was introspective and talked about it and how people are lonely, and that's why they attack you.  Like, she went somewhere with it.  So she understands comedy.  I just, her thing is, hey, look, this contributes to a rape culture. 
[01:12:30]  This whole thing where the victim is the thing.  She's like, there's rape victims in the audience, and you're basically saying.  But it's like, I can't think that way, because I mentioned the fact that Kamau did a very funny thing about that teapot that we talked about, the Hitler teapot.  Teapot, right.  And I referenced that, and I'm like, of course you didn't mean that, but there are people that see Hitler and all of a sudden find that very offensive.  So it's like, where do we stop, basically?  Like, why is the Holocaust okay?  And every joke you tell, I mean, someone is close to that in the audience, right? 
[01:13:00]  Why don't people with an agenda like that understand that they're not the only people that feel that comedy is offensive if you talk about this, that?  Don't they understand that you are merely a cog?  Yeah.  That given what she says, if everyone adhered to her wishes and everyone else's wishes, there would be no comedy.  But why don't they understand the basics, that if you tell a rape joke, that doesn't mean you're for rape.  Right.  Or the room is going to leave and start raping people. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  It's not going to happen.  Why do they make that huge leap and assume that, oh, wow, I guess rape's okay then if you're joking about it.  No, it's two different fucking things.  And she said that there's, and again, she's right.  There are people in the audience who have been raped.  Sure.  But part of comedy.  Well, when you're talking about fucking Paterno and all that, there's fucking people in the audience that were touched as kids.  That were molested.  Yes.  Every joke you make is going to affect someone personally.  It's going to bring back something.  Yeah.  Especially if it's about a difficult subject. 
[01:14:00]  It doesn't mean that you're telling people to go touch kids just because you have some good kid-touching jokes.  And it doesn't normalize it or make it okay if people laugh at it.  That's another myth that by laughing at it, you're normalizing it.  And by normalizing it, that contributes to rape culture.  Oh, boy.  But, I mean, that's what the thought process is, and I just don't agree with it.  Well, that's just stupidity.  I get what she's saying.  In the end, that's just stupidity.  I don't agree with it.  No, no, no.  No one should agree with that.  Or anything like that.  That'll shut down comedy.  That'll shut down stand-up. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Holy fuck!  And I quoted Matt and Trey, and I gave them credit.  They said, it's either all okay or none of it's okay.  Well, of course!  And there was people online who did not agree with that.  They're like, uh, no.  There's like certain feminists or certain special interest people.  Yeah.  That they're never going to agree with you, because the underlying point is that I don't  like what you're saying.  Right.  And that's all it comes down to.  But you shouldn't care if they never agree with you.  No, I don't.  But you should be able to continue doing what you do.  Yeah, but I didn't want to say to her, we were debating.  She was actually, again, when she was saying, like, hey, you can say what you want, but 
[01:15:00]  I can call you a dick.  She wasn't saying, hey, Jim Norton, you're a dick.  She was, again, using you as, like, I can call you, meaning whoever.  We were just the ones debating each other.  She wasn't attacking my comedy.  I do agree with that.  I agree, too.  But I get scared that, you know, you get enough people involved, and they will start fucking  pressuring the club owners to maybe make a rule or two, you know, here and there.  Well, that's what you don't want.  No, of course not.  That's what you're defending in the end.  Ja-fucka?  Yeah.  Nice.  I did end the segment.  Ja-fucka? 
[01:15:30]  I did end the segment by saying that she and I should make out, and the crowd kind of laughed.  Oh, that's funny.  But I would just ask people, if you're going to say things on YouTube, hey, look, again,  do what you feel is right, but...  But we like when we see the intelligent comments.  There's no need to attack her like that.  There's something nice about that.  Because she did show, the point I made, too, she showed up for a debate.  She didn't blog anonymously.  She wrote it as herself with her real picture.  Right, she's not hiding.  She's not hiding.  She fucking came.  She gave her real name, her real opinion.  She had thoughts behind what she said that we just didn't agree on. 
[01:16:00]  But, you know, she fucking came for the debate, man.  There's no need to be that brutal.  I didn't want to tell her to go fuck herself.  I just didn't like her point, and she didn't like mine.  That was it.  All right.  So, please, guys.  We have Kevin Smith in studio.  Yes.  Hey, can I add my two cents?  Sure.  If you're a fan, never go and speak on behalf of somebody you like with the illest tongue  and the worst grammar.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you're a fan, just present the best you possibly can. 
[01:16:30]  If you're a fan of these guys and you want to go on the defensive or on the offensive defensive  and attack people who attack the people you like, just make sure it's ironclad and watertight.  Don't give anyone the slightest pause to be like, they misspelled cock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get it all right.  And then you're joking.  Yeah, with two cues.  Yeah, you've...  I got a line when it comes to humor, though.  Rape jokes.  I'm not saying they shouldn't do them, but that's where I kind of go, ugh. 
[01:17:00]  It might be because I have a daughter.  Like, it wasn't...  Before I had a kid, it never really occurred to me.  And I wasn't out there going, like, listen to this fucking latest joke.  You know what?  But it wasn't like...  Once I had a daughter, suddenly I had a line.  I got to add to that.  Since being a father, the kid stuff is a little rough for me.  But I'm not going to fucking tell people they shouldn't do it.  My wife, on the other hand.  But that's my sense of area.  Holy crap.  I'll tell you not to do it.  Oh, really?  Oh, God.  Yeah, but that's my...  That's sort of a little line I got now where, like, eh, I don't dig it as much as I used 
[01:17:30]  it, but I'm not going to be the guy saying, oh, we've got to stop this.  Fuck that.  You're just saying for you, when you reach into your...  Yeah, we all have our fucking lines.  Of course not.  How's everybody doing, man?  Good.  Very good, Kevin.  I'm sure you've already discussed Michael Douglas.  No.  No, we haven't.  We've had a busy morning.  Get the fuck out of here.  Why?  There's something happening that I don't know about.  No.  Because this is the biggest news in the...  We're waiting for you.  It's on the cover of the post.  We were waiting for you.  We were talking about tornadoes and...  It's huge.  I guess there's that shit as well.  Robot arms.  That was on 60 Minutes last night.  What?  Eating the chocolate?  Did you see the 60 Minutes piece on the new robotic arm? 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, where the lady was...  Is this the lady who is quadriplegic?  She can't fucking...  And they put...  Yes!  ...diotes in her head and now she's feeding herself chocolate.  Yes!  Like Matrix shit in her head.  Pretty fucked up.  That's the beginning of the cybernetic revolution.  Yes.  I mean, I'm not going to say she's the first fucking cyborg, but that is...  We're getting there.  ...what cybernetics are.  That's bionics right there.  We're going to see some shit before our lives pass us by.  If we're lucky enough to.  Motherfuckers and giants spider.  Motherfuckers and wild, wild, wild.  Just before my friend Walter Flanagan, the dude on Comic Book Man, is always going like, 
[01:18:30]  I really hope that there are aliens and I really hope I see it in my lifetime, them  landing, and I really hope it's the day I die, and I really hope they're fully armed.  Wow.  He's just like, I just want it to be so true and they're hostile.  He's going, but I don't want to live through it.  The funny thing about the robotic arm, it moves just like your arm would with the same  exact pressure and stuff, and we're sitting here going, they're going to modify that shit,  and that's going to be just a bionic arm crushing shit.  Yeah.  Why would it have to just be as strong as your regular hand? 
[01:19:00]  You can make that fucking thing.  When you can tweak it just slightly and go, yeah, I want a little more straight.  Totally.  Where you can just, I'm picking up a tractor and throwing it at you, Batman.  Right.  That's what we're at.  That's kind of nice.  Heck, that shit.  But what you're talking about, Michael Douglas came out today, it's everywhere, that basically  he got throat cancer from eating pussy.  That's what he said.  Let's break it down.  Let's break it down.  It's on the cover of the...  I couldn't believe...  They're being careful.  They're calling it oral sex and this and that, but...  What he maintains, somebody asked him in an interview, like, well, were you sad or did 
[01:19:30]  you regret doing all that smoking and drinking when he had throat cancer for a while there?  And he kind of said, well, it wasn't that.  What?  I got it from eating...  Well, he didn't say it was pussy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Essentially, he's like, I got it from eating pussy.  I got it from oral sex.  It's an HPV virus that is contracted usually or mostly through oral sex, male to female  or someone to female oral sex.  Where does that HPV hang out?  Is it when you go real deep with the tongue or is it on the outside? 
[01:20:00]  I need to know.  Where does it hang out, Kevin?  That's what's fascinating to me.  Oh, I'm the only one thinking that shit.  How deep is it?  Where is it?  What does it look like?  How can we identify it?  Is it right on the clit or is it kind of deep?  How can we put a blue dye in there so it shows up?  Right.  So maybe we can avoid where that HPV is hanging out?  But the weird part of the story is, unless he goes deeper, explains it further, did he  get it from Catherine's head?  That's what we were saying before the show.  Or was he going like, back in the day, before I married her, I was eating all sorts of pussy. 
[01:20:30]  Well, she's basically telling the world that she's got diseased pussy.  Yeah, look out.  I mean, I don't want to be that person, but I mean, that's true.  It's not plays.  I know that's not the case.  But he's not explaining yet, so that's what we have to assume.  Yes.  But he did come out and say he was a sex addict for a while, right?  Oh, God, yeah.  He was married to DeAndre at one point, and then she cheated on her mercilessly, and then  went to, he was the first person I think I ever heard of, went to rehab for sex addiction.  For sex addiction.  But now you've got to think, you know, if anything ever happens between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones, 
[01:21:00]  she's out on the dating scene, and guys are just like, yeah, ah.  I'm not going down there.  I ain't fucking going down there to kill cancer pussy.  Man, only a year ago, she was like a goddess, and now she's like a crazy bitch with possibly  pussy.  Oh, my God.  I thought that was such a bizarre admission, though.  That's a fall from grace.  It is.  Although, it's kind of the admission that, like, makes you look smooth.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, you know how I got cancer.  I ate so much pussy.  Oh, God, I can't stop eating pussy.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:21:30]  If I ate so much pussy, pussy attacked me and gave me cancer.  That's how much I love pussy.  Pussy.  You think there's a Yul Brynner commercial on his future?  I'm Michael Douglas and I passed.  Stop eating pussy.  Right.  Remember that famous commercial?  Right.  You know that when that story hit, like, every woman in the world was like, shut the fuck  up.  Yeah, yeah.  It's hard enough to get him to eat a pussy, and now you're scaring him away with cancer.  Tell him there's a cancer cluster in my vag.  You know, the black guys don't have this. 
[01:22:00]  No, no.  They don't eat the coots.  Is that true?  I think everyone eats pussy.  Yeah, yeah.  I think even gay dudes eat pussy.  I think that's it.  When I was a kid, nobody ate pussy, but now everybody eats pussy.  Is this the commercial?  I'm dead now.  Yeah, listen to this.  Ah.  It's spooky, man.  It is.  Ladies and gentlemen, the late Yul Brynner.  65 years old.  I really wanted to make a commercial when I discovered that I was that sick, and my time  was so limited, I wanted to make that commercial that says, simply, now that I'm gone, I tell 
[01:22:30]  you, don't smoke.  Don't eat pussy.  Whatever you do, just don't smoke.  Poor guy.  That chemo gave him a full head of hair.  Terrible.  Wow, man.  It's also kind of like, now that I'm gone, now that I smoked a lot, you shouldn't do it.  Yeah, don't do it.  It's easy to say that.  He didn't look that unhealthy, too.  No.  I know that wasn't shot on his deathbed, but.  1985.  I guess because he had kind of that look, you know.  And he was just like, look, I got cancer the fucking straight old-fashioned way. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't know there was an alternate route, Michael Douglas.  Getting some pussy licking.  Nobody told us that that was possible.  That's a crazy story, though.  HPV.  We only learned about that a year or two, that he could get maybe cancer.  Really?  Yeah.  That's very new.  That's very new, I'm telling you.  What do you think that is?  Now, presumably, men have been, well, everyone's been eating pussy for eons.  Fuck yeah, right, Kev?  Heavens yeah, right here, boy.  Fuck yeah.  We love it.  We love it.  We love it.  We love it. 
[01:23:30]  Ladies, you listening?  Fuck yeah.  I'm right in there.  Shit's wet up in my face.  I'll leave your fucking pussy so sloppy.  Jesus.  I'll wear it like a mask.  I'll look like non-numb for fucking Return of the Jedi.  I'm eating so much pussy.  Fuck yeah.  Put your asshole over my forehead and plop that cunt on my mouth, ladies.  Jesus.  Fuck yeah.  Wow.  But do you remember when we were younger, were you one of a few, Norton, that ate pussy?  Sorry.  May I pull you out of your vest?  Yes, I love eating pussy.  I really do.  But when you were younger, were you one of the only few? 
[01:24:00]  I see where you're going here.  When I was a kid, you would talk to your friends about eating pussy, and they'd be like, yeah.  It was like in The Sopranos when his uncle, Junior, was talking about eating pussy.  But that's because of what it looked like back then.  Because of the bush and shit.  Holy fuck.  You're saying once they got into the land of virgin smoothies and garlic strips.  We didn't know any different.  We've done this a million times, but you had to fucking find it.  I liked that.  It was like somebody went in and took the jungle down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Deforestation.  It's true.  If you look at, like, 70s Playboy and whatnot, it's a hair bikini down there. 
[01:24:30]  Big fucking muffs.  But we didn't know any better.  You didn't not go down on someone because it was hairy, because there was no alternative.  Yeah, right.  There's simply no alternative.  But there was no education either.  Nobody ever said, like, hey, you should do something for her.  I was doing that from way...  I loved my face by a girl's ass.  Like, I was oral as a kid.  Yeah.  So for me, it wasn't like the pussy eating, what are you doing?  It was more about the ass eating and the urination stuff.  That started early on.  They were like, what are you doing?  Just lick it.  How old were you?  How old were you when you first licked pussy? 
[01:25:00]  Oh, I was just a very, very young.  But then as a young teenager, I was eating it.  How old?  I'm going to guess second or third grade.  Holy fuck.  What, on the reg, or just like every once in a while?  No, no, no, just with my friends.  Me and my friends would blow each other.  So when a pussy showed up, I was like, what am I?  Of course.  My day.  I might as well.  First or second grade.  Yeah, yeah.  I was young.  That's early.  Yeah.  I remember playing around with this girl, Carrie, and this other dude behind Kevin Horvath's  apartment building, which my mom called the penitentiary, which I thought that's what 
[01:25:30]  it was for years.  And I remember passing another apartment complex later in life.  And I was like, oh, there's one of them penitentiaries.  And people were like, that's really fucking thoughtless.  That really is a horrible thing to say.  And then I looked it up, and I was like, oh.  So anyway, behind his apartment, and there was this alleyway, and it was me and this girl  and this dude.  And this dude was like instructing us.  He was directing us what to do.  And he was just like, put your mouth under pussy.  And I was six, so I didn't know.  Oh, man.  Like, I didn't know. 
[01:26:00]  You know, get in there and gently caress.  And he was like, suck.  I didn't even know.  How old was he?  He was fucking and biting.  Same age.  Okay.  And he wasn't involved.  The weird thing is he was very like, I'll direct, right?  Yeah, he was doing something that he had seen other people do.  She was six, same age.  We were both the same age.  I can't imagine this.  Did he try jamming his dick in there?  No.  Throwing him.  Again, he was just, he was more of a like, I'm creepy, I'll work.  Yeah, because someone tells me he was being directed at some other point in his life by somebody.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was his chance to have the power.  It's true, because where does a six-year-old get that? 
[01:26:30]  You don't.  Put your mouth on her pussy or whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm embarrassed to say I was 18.  First time?  You like pussy?  Yep.  She was six, but he was only.  Terrible.  No, I come from a very strict household, man.  And, man, I don't even think I had a pussy.  And your mom was like, not until you're 18.  Oh, I guess.  Smell your breath when you come home.  All right.  Are you out there eating pussy?  Dude, I lost my virginity and all that shit when I was 18, freshman in college.  So it wasn't until you got out of town.  And I was a good-looking dude, too, man. 
[01:27:00]  Fuck yeah, man.  So it wasn't, I didn't have a problem.  Still are.  A good-looking dude with a mom with an iron fist.  Dude, fuck.  Yeah.  With an even more iron fist.  Horrible curfews.  I mean, we couldn't stay out or nothing.  Did they bust your ass if they caught you jerking off?  Or were they like, don't touch yourself?  No, no, no.  They're like, you can touch yourself, but no one else is laughing.  No, my household, we just never talked about it.  Really?  No, man.  No.  For my old man, I tried to talk about it at one point with me.  Well, you know about hard-ons?  I was like, I do.  Let's not have this conversation with it all. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah, we're done here.  I tell the story.  They showed the film when we were in sixth grade.  And then they told us when you get home, we told your parents that you're seeing the  film today.  So if you have any questions.  So I came home and my dad right away is like, so how was the film?  And I ran up in, this is a true story, ran up into our apple tree and I stayed up  there.  I didn't want, and I'm like, dad, I don't want to fucking talk about it.  This is like something out of fucking Andy Griffith.  Of course it was.  It was just so awkward.  Or the bad news bears when a mod went up in the chair.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Because there was no talk of sexual shit in my house. 
[01:28:00]  So all of a sudden at 12, you're going to talk about this stuff to me?  Because 12 was pretty old back then.  God bless you.  Yeah.  There was shit going around all, you know, you were learning all sorts of shit and none  of it came into the household for discussion.  So I ran up into that tree like, no fucking way.  And then eventually we didn't talk about this.  You were like, there's truth in this tree.  I know.  Why not just go up to your room?  It was just like, we didn't have that relationship or we weren't that open as far as that shit  goes.  So now all of a sudden, no, give me a little time to fucking think about what I just saw 
[01:28:30]  at the school.  They're like, look.  And I think I came down and we did end up talking that day or the next day.  It was fine.  How old were you the first time you got blown?  Were you 18 when you first got blown?  All that.  Everything, man.  Yeah.  Was it all the same day?  Yeah.  One great afternoon.  You're like one of those, uh, what are they?  The, uh, the Quaker, not the Quakers.  What are they called?  The Amish?  The Amish where they got rum.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You just stop doing it all.  I can understand that shit.  Cause when I got away from the strict household and went far away to college, yeah, it was a  whole new world. 
[01:29:00]  Like Ant talks about, uh, what?  Wizard of Oz going to color?  Yeah.  I was like, holy fuck.  Look at this shit I can do now.  Yeah, man.  Shit was great.  It was definitely cool.  If I was your parents, I would have been like, not only is this kid fucking obviously undereducated  about sex, he doesn't even know where his fucking room is.  He's just climbing a tree.  Why are you in a tree?  That's the thing that captures my imagination.  But I also never looked at my age.  I always looked way younger than I was.  You know, finally when I turned 18, I finally fucking grew and the hormones kicked in finally. 
[01:29:30]  So I was way behind always.  Always.  Whoever took you first must have been like, you're kidding.  Nobody?  No one?  Not even a handjob?  You're like, nothing.  Nothing.  Totally clean.  She was probably like, go rubber free, buddy.  No, I mean, I fooled around in high school and stuff, but nothing like you guys are talking  about.  Fuck no.  I mean, I used to joke about, you know, touching patch and all that.  And, you know, we got some things done.  But as far as intercourse and flow jobs and fucking, no.  As far as eating so much pussy, you get throat cancer. 
[01:30:00]  That's right.  18.  When did you lose your virginity?  When do you technically consider it?  18, the first time I fucked.  Really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So all that stuff you were doing while you were young, but 18.  I had my cock stuck before we get hard by 10 different people.  Wait, Jimmy, 18?  I didn't know that.  First time I put my dick in a girl, I was 18 years old.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, because that, wow, that's weird.  I remember me.  That's even stranger than my shit, I think.  Because you were doing all sorts of stuff.  You were assuming that you would have.  Yeah.  I was 12.  Buried it before 18.  No.  Me and my friend would blow each other, and I literally didn't understand why his penis 
[01:30:30]  stood up and mine didn't.  Like, my dick wouldn't even get hard at that age.  Like, I didn't, I had no idea why.  I just remember it felt good and comforting to feel a mouth on my dick.  Well, yeah, it still does, doesn't it?  But, yeah, but I mean, like, now I want it to get hard.  Something's never changed.  But his stood up, and I was like, why did, like, I just didn't get it.  All right, what's that about?  Why did his stand up and yours did not?  Yeah.  He was into it, you were not.  No, but I was just, I was really fucking young.  Right.  I just think, and eventually it started to, but I just didn't, I guess I didn't know  what was going on.  Yeah.  He was like a year older. 
[01:31:00]  He wasn't, it wasn't like he was much older.  But I was just a boy.  You were just a young little lad.  Yeah.  You know how it is.  Poor little Jimmy.  You and your pals.  You blow me, I blow you, whatever.  You owe me 10 socks.  I owe you 10 socks.  I heard you talk about this, and I'm like, holy Christ, I wish I'd grown up with him.  We didn't have any of that where I was.  Ant's waiting for his turn, because he always got laid.  He just always got laid.  From what age, sir?  His father, his father brought him his first chick.  Why?  Well, she was a friend of the family.  Yeah.  Pro?  No, no. 
[01:31:30]  She was a friend of the family.  She was always around.  Technically, she was a pro.  She didn't do it for money, but she was a pro.  She was 19.  I was 13.  It was just one of those things.  And dad was like, top him off!  He kind of probably went and pulled her side.  I was like, hey, why don't you, you know, hook up anything on there.  She was like, all right.  Drink a little bit.  Fucking went right at it.  Did you talk to dad afterwards and be like, well...  It was very embarrassing.  Was it?  I was just like, I don't want to talk to dad about it.  It was not bonding?  Like, let's have a beer and talk pussy, dad. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, I was.  Don't ever eat too much of it, son.  Cancer awaits.  Cancer awaits.  If I remember, old Buzz.  Her name was Christine, but everyone called her Buzz.  Why?  I don't know.  I think she was at a Buzz.  No, that's just it.  She had a fucking big ass Bush.  So Buzz, was she always drunk?  Yeah.  Yeah, she was always hammered.  I guess that would explain why she would fuck a 13-year-old.  Yeah, fuck a 13-year-old.  Yeah, she told me to go take a shower.  Before or after?  Before.  I was like, all right. 
[01:32:30]  Do you think you stunk?  Yeah, I was riding horses all day.  That swamp ass.  13 body odor.  Yeah, you fucking greasy asshole.  With saddle smell on it.  Smells like fucking dusty trails.  Yeah, yeah.  Could you shower?  Your asshole smells like gun smoke.  Yeah, she was in the...  Which is confusing if you don't know the show.  Absolutely.  Because you're sitting there going, what?  Gun smoke is good.  Oh, that was a show.  Gun smoke is good.  She was sitting up in my dad and his fucking girlfriend's bed at the time. 
[01:33:00]  Of course, they weren't there.  And she had the blanket just up to her tummy.  So I walked past the bedroom and looked in, and I was like, oh my God, those are real tits right there.  Oh, man.  And I couldn't figure out what was going on.  I'm like, wait a minute.  I'm walking in my room.  I peeked in there and I saw that.  And then it hit me.  I'm like, oh, oh, wait a minute. 
[01:33:30]  I think I'm supposed to fucking go in there and do something.  I would have been so scared when it fell this thing.  Like, you walk in.  Yeah, yeah.  And you're like, oh, no.  Right in there.  Go in there.  His father's down the hall.  Go in there.  Go inside.  Yeah, yeah.  It's right there.  It's over there.  It's over there, Dad.  Oh, no.  It's right over there.  So you go in?  Yeah.  And she's like, did you shower?  She was pretty good.  She, you know, very teacherly.  Where'd you come?  Huh?  Where'd you come?  Right inside there.  What a trooper Buzz was.  Buzz was great. 
[01:34:00]  She fucking let Ant just blow lunch right in her box.  What a good egg.  It's like My Tudor, dude.  Like the movie from the 80s when we were kids.  I never saw that.  There was the movie about the guy who had, like, the tutor who was older.  And it wasn't a Sylvia Christelle or something like that.  Fuck, Emanuel.  Yeah.  She was great.  She was in Goodbye, Emanuel.  She was the maid and around the kid and the rich kid.  It was almost like this situation.  Oh, it was crazy.  Yeah.  And then, you know, going to school.  It was like, because then she would get that went on for a while. 
[01:34:30]  She'd come over before I had to go to school.  In the morning you were getting pussy?  Yeah, yeah.  Holy fuck.  She, like, bawled me and shit and fucking.  And then I'd go to school and I'd just be walking around fucking Marco Forrester Elementary School,  Junior High, whatever the fuck it was.  But I'm just calling people aside being like, this is pointless.  I've discovered the reason for life.  That's how I felt.  That's exactly how I felt.  Fuck your mapping algorithm.  Someone will put your dick in your mouth.  It's like, are you really playing fucking tetherball? 
[01:35:00]  Are you really?  Do you understand what's out there?  Do you understand what the fuck is going on?  There's only one ball that matters.  He's got a twin.  Yeah.  Did anyone understand, though?  They couldn't wrap their heads around it, right?  Couldn't figure it out.  They'd, like, discuss sex in this weird, abstract, kind of, you know, obviously had no clue about it.  They were still trying to figure out how to get it.  Yeah, yeah.  And I'm like, oh, you don't even know what this is.  You don't even know.  But I never fessed up.  I was never like, yeah, I'm getting fucking pushy at home.  I just, no, I was just listening and talking. 
[01:35:30]  You were just cool, man.  Yeah, you weren't throwing it out there.  No, no.  Because you didn't want to ruin it.  I didn't want to ruin it.  That's what happens with these kids when they start blabbing at school and before you know  the police are involved.  Fuck that.  Yeah, that's true.  That went on for, like, probably nine months or so.  Eight, nine months.  I saw a story recently about a kid who blew the whistle.  A boy.  Yeah, because he wasn't getting any.  I thought it was vice versa.  I thought she, like, attacked him in the class.  The one I read is she attacked him in the classroom.  And he took a fucking selfie of them going at it.  Oh, boy. 
[01:36:00]  And then he was maintaining that.  He's like, I didn't want this.  Oh, come on.  Every boy wants that from their teacher.  That's why I laugh at all those stories.  But I'm like, I don't know.  I saw a picture of her.  I was like, if I was 16, this lady was just like, fuck me, stupid.  I was like, wait, am I stupid?  It was every guy's fantasy growing up.  We all had that one hot teacher.  And you wouldn't have fucking had mental problems if that went down.  You would have loved it.  Right?  Yeah.  Is this the.  He's looking at my tutor.  But what was the other one?  My tutor was one.  It was about a house.  What was the other one? 
[01:36:30]  Damn.  My tutor?  Tom Cruise losing it?  But that.  Well, that was.  Remember, they went south of the board.  Yeah, yeah.  Spanish fly.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  It wasn't the kid from fucking.  Kelly Leak.  Kelly Leak was in there.  Yeah, Kelly Leak.  Yeah, it's fucked up, man.  It was, you know.  All right.  So my tutor was one.  But the one I'm thinking of, the one with Sylvia Christelle was.  Damn it.  Can you just Google Sylvia Christelle?  Yeah.  Help him out there, Sam.  I can't remember the name of his flick for the life of me.  Not like it matters, but as you're sitting here watching. 
[01:37:00]  God, this trailer is like 10 minutes long right now.  I know, right?  If you watch the My Tutor trailer, you never have to see the movie.  They show you everything, including nudity.  It's all right there.  God damn.  You see any of the movies over the weekend, Kevin?  While we find that?  What opened up after?  Well, the Will Smith.  No.  Did anybody say after?  That's his first bomb, they're saying, in like 20 years.  Because he's always.  That's technically not true.  He was in Jersey Girl.  Was he?  Yeah, he was.  Look at that.  There's a problem right there.  Well, he did the Memorial Day weekend movie for the last 20 years. 
[01:37:30]  And they're saying this is the first one.  He used to be the 4th of July guy.  Remember?  Yeah.  Oh, was it 4th of July that he moved to?  Independence Day.  Oh, yeah.  I guess you're right.  But he was the dependable summer guy.  Right.  Exactly.  Okay.  It seems like the problem with this movie was that he, Private Lessons, that's the name  of it.  Private Lessons.  Private Lessons.  It seemed like the problem with this flick was it wasn't really a Will Smith movie.  It was a movie, his kid top line, the movie.  And it was kind of, spoilers, rippled in a spaceship most of the movie. 
[01:38:00]  What's that?  His legs are broken.  A spaceship.  And he's just like, go do this, go do this.  And so he's talking the kid through it.  Oh, really?  That sounds awful.  And so I feel like it's just, remove everything else.  A lot of people are trying to lay it at the kid's feet and be like, oh, that kid's an  asshole.  And a lot of people are trying to lay it at M. Night Shyamalan's feet.  Yeah, yeah.  The director, although you couldn't, you wouldn't know it unless you looked real close because  they didn't market it.  They really didn't market it.  I think people are, I know you might be a friend of his, but I think he's awful.  Is he overrated at this point?  I don't personally like him.  And I think that, no, M. Night. 
[01:38:30]  And I don't like his stuff.  Is he overrated, do you think, at this point?  He's had a lot of bombs.  I don't know, man.  He liked Sixth Sense.  Sixth Sense was amazing.  Based on everybody talking about, oh my God, M. Night, he deserves the credit for this.  A lot of people start talking about his body work.  And then, you know, I can't sit there and join in because a lot of the same people have  been like, said some of the worst, same worst shit about him.  Right, right.  Fair enough.  But in reading, I was like, oh, a lot of people point to the village as everything going  south there.  I kind of liked the movie. 
[01:39:00]  I did.  I lost it last night.  I haven't seen it since.  I liked the concept.  I liked it.  I mean, they didn't totally pull it off, but it was, I was watching the footage.  How bad is it when you see it again?  It felt really bad.  And I also felt expensive.  The whole time, I'm like, come on.  I'm like, all this just to do that spin at the end.  Right.  Yeah.  But she's great in it.  Like, Bryce Howard is really, really fantastic in it.  But anyway, they said that was the point.  Of the movie, you're like, oh, that scene right there. 
[01:39:30]  He had, like, this cast.  I didn't love it.  A lot of famous people.  I just liked it at the time.  I thought it was all right.  A little backpedal.  A little backpedal right there.  Well, I don't want people to say that I loved it.  Because they will anyway.  They will anyway, yeah.  I don't know if After Earth had as much to do with any of that, though, as much as it  was, like, it looked like Oblivion, which came out not too long ago.  Like, Earth is dead, but we're back on it, but we've got to get off Earth.  Yeah.  This is almost the same plot in Oblivion.  It's the same plot in this movie.  And especially, it's like, if I save my bucks, I can go see, like, something way cooler is coming 
[01:40:00]  right down the pipe.  How about the Scientology thing with Earth in the title not really being very good?  Yeah, that's right.  That's the second myth.  And this was the first time that people, like, there was echoes of him maybe being  into Scientology, but then it went quiet.  But because of this movie, now everyone's talking about it again.  Yeah.  What about Star Trek?  You see it yet?  I didn't see it yet.  Oh, wow.  And just liked it, right?  I liked it.  You weren't blown away by it.  Well, as a huge Star Trek fan, I kind of, you notice things that are like, why'd they 
[01:40:30]  do that?  Wait a minute.  They should have done that instead of that.  You know, just the use of the transporter versus the shuttlecraft.  It's kind of like, yeah, well, you know, just beam that shit.  What are you doing?  And also the, like, you know, we all, I don't know how anyone didn't know.  The moment they announced, like, we've got a villain.  Yeah.  You've never heard of him before.  You were like, okay, pretty spoilers.  It's probably going to be their variation of Khan, which it turned out to be. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I heard that they liberally stole from that flick.  Yeah, they did.  There was, like, certain scenes that were just, like, wow.  And was there a scene where old Spock talked to young Spock and he was like, how did you  deal with your Khan?  And he's like, oh, my brother, you're going to have to buy your own.  You got to buy your own.  Was it that scene?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What was that?  What movie?  There's a scene in the new Star Trek, apparently, where old Spock talks to young Spock because,  you know, they've set up that we're on a separate timeline.  Young Spock got in touch with old Spock.  And he's just like, we're fighting this Khan, dude. 
[01:41:30]  What do we do?  What's with this Khan?  He's like, I can't tell you.  He told him one thing.  He just told him, you know.  Why can't he tell him?  He's like, eh, that guy's pretty fucking ruthless.  That's all he said.  Yeah.  They didn't know this by this point already?  I think they did.  So you're like, I got in touch with you for some help, and the best thing you could  do for me is, like, the guy who killed a bunch of people is a bad guy.  He's bad.  That's pretty much what it was.  Yeah, you got this amazing technology.  You could talk to your old self, but he's not going to tell you what to do.  That's so dumb. 
[01:42:00]  Especially because in the last movie, he's like, you know, aren't we not supposed to  run into each other?  He's like, ah, we just tell human beings that.  So it's been established that he can fuck with the timeline.  Yeah, why the fuck?  But suddenly, conveniently, he's just like, oh, no, my brother.  No, my brother.  You're going to have to buy your own.  So I haven't seen that, but that aspect I heard about, I was like, oh, man.  I like the reboot.  I thought the first reboot was amazing.  This one also, there's one scene where, I guess, the Khan, you know, character, before 
[01:42:30]  they realize who he is or whatnot, uses a portable transporter device to literally transport himself  clean across the fucking universe.  It's just, wait a minute.  What?  Then why do they have any device on the ships?  Why don't they just have this portable one where you could beam anywhere?  Like, it's not limited.  In the known or unknown galaxy.  Yeah, it wasn't even limited.  It just seemed like they really, if they needed an answer, they just wrote one.  Regardless. 
[01:43:00]  The movie I'm looking for is Man of Steel.  Yeah, yeah.  It's coming up.  That looks fucking crazy.  That's what I think.  There was a lot of people skipping after Earth because they're like, forget it, man.  The big daddy's on his way.  Man of Steel.  Have you seen the TV spots?  I saw all the trailers.  There's a TV spot that they came out.  I've been talking about it for a little while now.  About two, three weeks ago, the first TV spot I saw this shot in, and it's a shot of Superman.  He's got Lois Lane in his arms, and we're over his back, and he's apparently rushing away  from something exploding, some fucking danger, and he's holding her. 
[01:43:30]  So we're seeing the back of his head and the front of her face because she's looking back  over his shoulders.  And it might be her performance.  It's got to be her performance, hands down.  And the stuff that's in the frame around them, and the lighting and all that, and obviously  you get the impression like something horrible's happening, and it affects her at play.  But really, it all comes down to her performance.  Wow, really?  That performance in that one moment, she's got these eyes on that's just like, holy fuck,  the worst thing that has ever happened.  It's like five feet from me.  And somehow, unbelievably, this person is flying me, not running me, not driving me, flying 
[01:44:00]  me away from it.  Such a great actress.  She has everything playing across her face and makes you go like, fuck, fuck you, take  all my money.  Like, that's the moment, if you're a comic book reader, that's whenever you think about  the rescue, which is a big part of comic book mythology, like somebody being there for you  at that worst moment of your life and being there to save you, man or woman, it doesn't  matter.  When you think about it, that's what you imagine.  Because what they're usually rescuing you from, you see Batman swinging and catch somebody 
[01:44:30]  and whatnot.  Shit's exploding around him, and you've never really seen it depicted in a movie.  And just in that two seconds of the TV star, I was really, I was hooked in a big bed.  It looks amazing.  If I can, obviously, effect-wise, just when you look at the old, the old 1970, what was  it?  79?  78.  78.  You will believe a man can fly.  Right, right, right.  And at the time, that was amazing.  Because before that, all we had was then, da-da, da-da-da-da, the TV version. 
[01:45:00]  George Reeves would jump, and then lay down, and they'd blow windows.  It was all superimposed and everything, and that was like, oh my god.  Now, though, the great shots, when he goes supersonic, and you just see that cone of fucking  water, of vapor, you know, that vapor trail coming off of it.  And his cape, apparently, every shot of his cape is CG.  Wow, really?  So they didn't, yeah, because they were, I guess Zack Snyder was like, look, man, every  time...  You can't make a cape do that?  Yeah, you've got a cape laying on a guy who looks kind of dopey, no matter what they make  of it.  He's like, let's just do it CG, so every shot, it's all flowing and just flowing. 
[01:45:30]  They brought it to life.  No kidding.  When does the movie hit?  I think it's mid-June or something like that.  So we're almost there.  Yeah, it's not too far away.  It's not this weekend.  I think it's the weekend.  And that leads to, how does the Man of Steel shave?  That's what you're promoting today.  What a hell of a segue.  Yes.  How does he...  That's why we get the big bug.  How does he shave.com.  That's where folks could go to right now.  When we're talking about, with the Man of Steel movie out, the trailer out, you see him  with a beard at one point, and they see him with no beard. 
[01:46:00]  So the good folks at Gillette came up with this thing of like, how does he shave?  Exactly.  They would be super whiskers.  Bingo.  Now, it's one of these things where a lot of people in comics or who read comics are  like, you asshole, we all know how he fucking shaves.  John Byrne told us in 1986.  So, you know, you go out there and you explain, look, this is for the mainstream people who  maybe don't understand or didn't read John Byrne.  Wait, how was it explained back in 1986?  In 1986.  And was that the year?  That was the year.  The Man of Steel miniseries.  John Byrne relaunches Superman. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Recreates him.  Takes Lex Luthor from a scientist in the purple jumpsuit to Donald Trump, essentially.  A businessman who is like Metropolis's favorite son, who hates Superman, who shows that this  alien shows up.  He becomes Metropolis's favorite son.  This dude's like, I hate him for that reason alone.  And so he starts trying to crush him on a corporate level more so than like, I'm going  to create a giant spider and come after you.  So he reinvents, John Byrne reinvents Superman. 
[01:47:00]  And one of the things he does is answer like dopey questions that for years people who love  comic books would ask.  And one was like, how does he shave?  How does Superman shave?  And he said, John Byrne said he has a mirror that he uses his heat vision on.  And so he bounces his heat vision off the mirror to his face and then hits every strand  and burns it off his face.  Oh.  That's how he does it?  That's how he does it.  That is how he does it in a fictional world because the character is not real.  But that's the answer that they gave us many years ago. 
[01:47:30]  And of course, comic book people, number one, you'll accept any sort of pseudoscience.  But number two, John Byrne said it.  So we're all like, great.  That's how he shaves.  Yeah.  So can I go online and just say that's how he shaves?  You can, but then people will say, wow, we're looking beyond that.  They wanted to disqualify that right away.  All right.  So we're not doing that one.  So I start mine by talking about that theory and whatnot and then go on like, but here's  my alternative theory.  So they got me.  They got Bill Nye, the science guy.  Oh.  They got Mayim Bialik, the Blossom, who's on Big Bang Theory. 
[01:48:00]  And then they got the Mythbusters dudes.  Oh, very cool.  And so they asked all of us, how do you shave?  We each got a theory.  And then you're supposed to vote them up.  I hope everyone votes mine up.  Mine is actually the one that makes the most sense.  Does it?  What is yours?  It's logical.  My baby rocket theory, I said the rocket that brought him to Earth, every permutation of  the story is in the rocket.  Yes.  Rocket comes from Krypton, it's strong enough, so he's bang off a piece of that metal and  he can hammer it out and that's what he would use to save.  Some people talk about like, well, in what was that movie with Will Smith? 
[01:48:30]  Not Hitch, but the other superhero, Hancock.  Yeah, Hancock.  He shaved with a fingernail.  But I'm like, that didn't make sense, because I'm a human being and I can't shave with a  fingernail.  Right.  Like, basically, you take a power and augment it.  You can't magically give somebody the ability to do something that even with, like...  Relative to his strength.  I know.  You get tied up in this, like, that's not true, and people are like, the whole fucking  thing's not true.  Yeah, the whole flying thing would get me before how does he shave? 
[01:49:00]  Exactly.  A lot of people have a little problem with that.  I like your idea there.  That is a lot better.  I listen to the rest, right?  What does Bill Nye say?  Bill Nye is, he goes, look, in order to shave something down, you could grind it down,  you just need something that's equally as powerful that would grind it down.  So if you've got a stone, you need another stone to grind it down.  If you grind it across each other, it would be really hard.  But his theory doesn't say what that other element is.  Right.  It's like, we just have to find an element as strong as Superman's beard. 
[01:49:30]  That's got to be very strong.  He loses.  Yeah, I say that's not.  You're in the lead.  Myams begins with, like, you know, she begins with a lie.  She goes, they're doing research in the field of Kryptonian DNA and genetics.  Oh, no.  So that's horse shit.  Like, nobody's doing that anywhere.  So hers is all about, like, since they're doing this, they're going to come up with a  cream that you could rub in his face and it's just got low-density niptonite levels that  make this ball.  Again, it's made up. 
[01:50:00]  So that one I discount.  And then the Mythbusters, they went through a few.  One was black hole theory, which was like, you know, he just stands close to a black hole  and lets it suck his whiskers out.  Suck the whiskers out.  We're not going to take his eyeballs and everything else, though.  And his wiener.  And his wiener.  Right, right.  And his pubes.  So I don't know.  Honestly, my theory is the only one that's...  Yours makes perfect sense.  Scientifically sound.  Go to HowDoesHeShave.com.  Vote me up.  And I don't win anything for it.  It's just the moral right over Blossom.  Right. 
[01:50:30]  And the Mythbusters and Bill Nye.  And it really would be terrible if you didn't win this, because you really are the expert  as far as that goes.  You pointed out the pink elephant in the room.  Come on.  That's true.  If I don't win this, what have I been doing for the last 20 years?  Right, right.  This is all I do is talk about other people's movies.  No one's going to go, hey, Blossom, you didn't know.  She's a neuroscientist.  I know, yeah.  She's got degrees.  Crazy.  Listen, we've got to take a break.  Are you sticking around today?  Yeah, if you like me.  Oh, good.  Kevin Smith is here today.  Very good.  Last time was quick.  It was in and out, man. 
[01:51:00]  How did the cartoon go?  It was lovely.  We had such a good time.  Nice crowd.  It was great theater.  Awesome.  It was a fun night.  Yeah, yeah.  Awesome.  That's true.  We're still out there with Jane Silent Bob's super groovy cartoon movie.  You are.  Yeah, yeah.  You're still toying with that.  We do.  We come home, and then we go back out.  This weekend, we go to Pittsburgh and Columbus and stuff like that.  Sweet, man.  That Kevin Smith on Twitter.  What else?  HowDoesHeShave.com.  Go to HowDoesHeShave.com, man, and vote my ass up.  All right.  We'll continue with Kevin Smith.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:51:30]  Sirius X.  Sirius X.  I was driving home, and I was behind a bus.  You know, like the bus has an automatic sign?  911, call police.  I call 911.  911, what is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound, and I'm behind a bus, and the sign says, call 911.  I thought it was a stolen bus.  I didn't know what was happening.  There could have been hostages.  I mean, we all saw that Keanu Reeves movie.  I'm on the phone with a 911, and this fucking dummy is, where are you now?  I said, I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th Avenue. 
[01:52:00]  Okay, you're on, now, where are you now?  I said, 48th Street.  Where are you now?  49th Street.  And you said, it's heading which way, sir?  Northbound.  The only way you can go on 10th Avenue.  We're so irritated with these dummies.  So we make the left on 57th Street.  We go down to 11th Avenue.  I go, look, he's making the left on 11th Avenue.  It's a yellow light, so the bus slows down and then shoots through the light and leaves  me at the red light.  I knew that the bus did that on purpose.  I'm like, this guy knows I'm behind him.  Now we're going southbound again.  So I called back.  911, there's an emergency.  So I just called, and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think. 
[01:52:30]  No one is doing it.  How long does it take to get a squad car on fucking 11th Avenue?  So I pull up next to it, and it's really dark on the bus.  And you see some, there's a black dude.  I'm on the phone.  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy.  And he's just a black dude, but he's not dressed like a bus driver.  And I know that he's stealing this bus.  I'm northbound now, and he's behind me.  And he's like, what street?  I'm like, now we're passing 40th Street.  The woman was like, where was he before?  10th and 11th, but then he came down 11th, and now we went up 10th.  He's probably going to turn it off because you're going to lose him.  So you keep saying 10th and 11th, but 10th and 11th are in parallel.  What street and 11th? 
[01:53:00]  I know, he was on 10th, and then he went down 11th.  So then I was just like, fuck this shit.  And I drive away, and he pulls away slowly and starts to drive.  And I'm like, you know what?  Forget it.  You know what?  He just turned it off.  He just turned it off.  Okay.  We lost him, and he probably turned into the bus depot.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:53:30]  If anyone's going to put me back as if I ever went.  If anyone's going to put me in a gym, it's going to be you.  Last time I was here.  Jimmy.  Jimmy looks great.  Thank you.  Jimmy looks fucking amazing.  Like, really, really.  And I hate saying that to people when they lost weight, because as a fat person, if you  lose a little weight, and I don't, this, you'd be just like, hey, you look pretty good.  And this isn't in reference to that.  But generally, when, like, one time I lost to, like, 60 pounds, and I was on Joy Behar,  and they made a little big deal of it.  Like, oh, you're fucking thinner now.  And it just always feels like people going, like, you look like shit before, without saying 
[01:54:00]  it.  You know what I'm saying?  So I don't mean that as, like, you look like shit before.  Oh, no, I didn't.  You always look good.  No, I looked like shit before.  No, you didn't.  But you always look trim.  But you look fucking tight now, and, like, neck and abs and shit like that.  Oh, it's the trainers.  Is it?  Yeah.  I was doing weights for a while and just eating right, and then I went to go on a couple  of trainers lately, and they fucking, like, little things, because I wouldn't sweat that  much in the gym.  I would try to sweat.  And these two fucking horrible human beings, I literally have to keep stopping and going 
[01:54:30]  like, ah, ah.  But then the exercises are not that crazy.  They just know how to get your heart rate up, and it's fucking, it's like all the money  I would spend on doing awful shit.  Now I just spend on that.  And the hot blonde is a horrible human being.  I saw her in the gym on Friday.  You weren't there working some dude, and she's just not a nice person.  I'm telling you, she's nice.  The ones we're talking about, she's like the hot one in the gym that everybody's like,  ah.  She's like, lower, lower, use your hips, like, just fucking horrible towards the guy. 
[01:55:00]  But he may, some guys may like, because she'll do that to me, but not harshly.  She'll go, come on, come on.  And she knows I don't get any sleep, so she's much easier on me when I don't sleep.  Some guys like that.  But some guys like someone and go, come on, let's go.  Like, I had the other one telling me yesterday I did girl push-ups.  It was funny, though.  She was just teasing me, but she was right.  She was like, you're doing girl push-ups.  She was like, girl push-ups.  And she goes to the guy, so why did you have that popcorn last night?  Oh, God.  And he goes, because I wanted to. 
[01:55:30]  And she goes, oh.  Oh, man.  And that was it.  And the guy, in that moment, I saw his face felt like shit.  But that's maybe what he requires, because you, honestly, because I deal with her.  So I know what you mean.  And she's, we have fun chats about everything.  Fun chats?  Yeah, yeah, fun chats.  But the second half of that, the guy was obviously looking for, like, oh, well, that's okay.  Every once in a while, but maybe next time you try not to. 
[01:56:00]  It was just, oh, you're a piece of shit.  Who knows what he said last week, though?  He may have come in and said, I have pecan pie.  She's at it.  She might have had enough of this guy.  I cheated again.  I heard you last week.  You're hoping for a little coddling.  Like, you know, it was a weak moment.  Well, that's okay.  We'll work on the weak moments.  You've got to think, for the trainers and whatnot, it's kind of like showing your product  if the people are fucking not in shape, and you're trying to get them in shape, and they're  like, yeah, that's my trainer. 
[01:56:30]  I was like, oh, they're doing a great job.  Yeah, that's true.  So you think they want you to fucking get into shape.  She's fucking good, though, man.  Like, she comes in, and she always has stuff printed out, like, for my workouts.  Like, she really puts effort into making sure it's different than the last time, and for  working specific muscle groups.  Like, she really cares about you getting in shape.  No, she's great, actually.  I mean, there's another guy at our gym that has a beer belly, and he's training people.  How is that going to motivate you?  Right.  That's my guy.  I want to train with somebody who I can feel slightly superior to, if not equal to. 
[01:57:00]  Right.  But maybe he understands totally how to get you in shape, but as soon as he shows up  with the beer belly, you're like, really?  What are you doing, sir?  Yeah, of course.  He's like, those who can't do, teach.  Yeah.  You get down, and you do something.  What is, are you allowed to plug her, or like, say?  I won't, because I don't know how, because she's a singer, so I don't know how much,  like, the other one doesn't want to.  The Reese of Franklin.  Yeah.  That's a really weird choice.  That would be an odd choice.  Yeah.  It was, uh...  You better get on it.  You better get on it. 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, like, if I do well, she'll sing R-E-S-P-E-C-T as I'm walking around and clapping.  Everybody joins in.  It's a big gospel thing.  That was a fun line.  Why did I have to ruin it by going too far?  We heard you, Jim.  Fucking asshole, Adam.  Um, no, because the other girl who I work with doesn't, uh, want herself plugged either.  She's doing some stuff.  Jimmy picked the two hottest trainers at the gym.  I mean, if you're going to a lot of one, like, at least that would, I would imagine,  inspire you a bit.  Fuck yeah.  And their energy, though. 
[01:58:00]  Like, I like, you know what it is?  In, in, they're both really, because I mean, I'm, I'm chatty, so they're both really nice,  and nicer than I thought they'd be, and, uh, the reason I figured out they'd come off  as cunti if you don't know them is because every guy wants to fuck them, so they have  to put up with so many awful conversations that they've learned just to probably talk  to people that they're training.  Do you understand what you just did?  You just pumped yourself up.  Like, oh, I'm chatty and stuff, but they're good and they're nice, but I can understand  how people would think they're cunti, because when you're not an interesting, great person  like me, and you talk to them, they fucking get it. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  That's what I said.  No, what I meant is, when you're working with them, they talk to you.  Like, no, I'm training with them, that's why I talk to them, but if I wasn't actually  working with them, so they talk to people who they're working with, and in this session  they're very talkative and friendly, but they're probably sick of guys trying to fuck them  and just annoying them while they're working, because the one I see I work with, the hot,  hot, and she's always got people asking her questions, and what happened last week?  Oh, God.  So I think they try to concentrate on the people that they're working on. 
[01:59:00]  Chicks got such a crust of bear, don't they?  Those hot chicks.  It's a lot of guys.  Bad chatter.  It's like being at an event all day.  Picture being at an event every time you're going for a sip of beer.  Oh, my God.  The guy walks up and goes, dude, that thing you did on the fuck with that lady.  That's what their life is like.  With that lady.  That time.  I got a little more.  So then I'm on the floor stretching my back, and the guy who's doing the kettlebells wrong,  because it's the one we have to like.  With your hips.  Yeah.  And then she demonstrates. 
[01:59:30]  I am 18 inches away from her amazing fucking camel toe.  She's demonstrating.  I saw the camel toe.  Oh, boy, did I finally.  It's out of control.  I've been meaning to tell you.  Jimmy loves a good camel toe.  Because they decided to come into my area, and I'm just stretching my back.  They're pretty much where you are, maybe closer.  And I'm like doing the cobra pose, stretching down my back a little bit,  and I'm just staring right at her.  It's out of control.  And thank you to that guy.  He didn't know what the fuck he was doing.  And she had to demonstrate, which really.  It's amazing. 
[02:00:00]  You were so close.  Man, she's just pushing everything forward.  I'm like, holy fuck.  So close that you got some throat cancer.  Dude, I was trying to be cool, though.  I don't want to look like a fucking pervert.  Jimmy said something the last time I was here,  as we were talking about right before we jumped back on air,  but he was talking about going to the gym.  I was like, oh, man, isn't that embarrassing?  People look at you.  And he was just like, no.  He said, that's not a reason to not do it.  He's going, everyone's paying attention to their own shit.  Just how you don't look at other people,  it's like they don't really look at you.  I would know it would be different, though,  because they'd be like, that's that fat motherfucker 
[02:00:30]  that got thrown off a plane.  Kevin Smith.  He's finally doing something about his fucking fat cancer.  But you know what people think when they see someone who's big?  And I've seen people who are fucking, who are truly huge.  You go, oh, great.  Look at that.  You respect the person for being there.  He's trying.  You never, I never think, oh, look at that fat.  So what are you?  I'm always like, good for you.  I'd rather see them there than, you know, fucking.  Fuck yeah.  I respect them.  Dunkin' donuts.  I think everybody respects somebody.  And again, you see people that are 500 pounds  just slowly walking. 
[02:01:00]  They can't do much.  But everybody respects that person.  He's not even here today.  Be nice.  Oh, wow.  Don't you respect someone like that when you see them?  Absolutely.  It's like, it's fucking, man.  They're making a real effort.  All right.  I mean, either.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  I'm much too self-centered.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Of course I do.  I sit there and think, you fat piece of shit.  It's great material, too.  It's great fodder for material.  What do you mean?  And in the gym?  Yeah, you just talk about it like your whole life is different.  I'm a big-time pussy because I watch Biggest Loser.  And, you know, I might get a little teary-eyed. 
[02:01:30]  A little choked up?  Holy fuck.  I haven't watched.  I didn't.  I blew.  I blew out.  I was going to say I blew out a couple seasons ago.  Who's out?  I haven't watched in a couple seasons.  But I was all in for many, many, many fucking seasons with that dumb show.  If I ever once in a while, there's a quasi-celebrity one, too, right?  Yeah.  Where people do it and stuff.  I remember at one point they asked me, like, are you interested?  No, I still got a modicum of dignity.  Right, yeah.  But I did watch.  This is apropos of nothing, man. 
[02:02:00]  I know I'm probably way late on this, but I don't ever watch Kitchen Nightmares.  But, like, I've been seeing.  I mean, I'm an AOL guy, so I'm on HuffPost almost every day.  So I've been seeing this Amy's Baking Company story.  Did you see this?  I haven't seen this one yet.  I've been out of this.  What exactly is this about?  You see it?  It is, dude, it is some of the most entertaining, mind-bending television I've ever seen.  And the only problem with it is it's only one.  Like, they only went to these people once.  Oh, shit.  These people are so fascinating to watch. 
[02:02:30]  There's this couple, married couple, an older guy, and this lady named Amy.  They got this restaurant in Scottsdale, Arizona.  And, you know, I guess the premise of this show is, like, we're having problems in our restaurant.  We need Chef Ramsay to come fucking make us decent human beings.  So he comes in, and he observes, has some of their food, the model of the show, I guess.  And then, you know, he tells them what they're doing wrong, and he stays until they improve, and then he leaves.  So he came to do that on this show, man. 
[02:03:00]  And the people that he came to work with, this chick, Amy, is just, it comes across, at least in the show,  who knows what she's like in real life, fucking batshit.  Really?  They got this situation where he's, her husband, I guess, is the guy that's seating everybody, bringing orders.  They have waitresses, but they pay him a salary, and they don't let him take the tips.  He keeps the tips.  Fuck!  The manager, and first, that's what Ramsay hears about this.  He's like, you keep the tips.  And he's just like, yes, but I am the one doing all of the running and stuff.  He's like, if I told your customer. </pre>
