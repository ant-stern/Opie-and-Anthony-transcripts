<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show began with a discussion contrasting Fox News' John Gibson's attribution of a Los Angeles power outage to Al-Qaeda with CNN's more accurate reporting of an equipment malfunction.  This transitioned into a birthday celebration for Jim Norton, which quickly devolved into a heated critique of Howard Stern, accusing him of hypocrisy and laziness, particularly regarding his past criticisms and his current SiriusXM hires.  Stern's family issues were also brought up, fueled by listener calls echoing these criticisms.  Jim Norton’s impending move to Hollywood was discussed at length, alongside a detailed, sexually suggestive description—accompanied by a photograph—of his unusual birthday cake, eliciting both amusement and disgust from the hosts.  An XM executive, Eric Logan, called in to guarantee Opie and Anthony would surpass Stern’s listenership, citing XM's advantageous position, especially after acquiring exclusive Canadian NHL broadcasting rights.  The show featured numerous comedic bits, including impersonations and jokes about the cake, Howard Stern, and radio broadcasting in general.  The sexually suggestive cake was a recurring topic, and the broadcast employed frequent derogatory and offensive language.

The show continued with a discussion of an online auction featuring items like a Cal Ripken Jr. baseball, an XM MyFi, and a “WNEW Inappropriate Bell.”  A mocking playback of a deeply awkward Celine Dion interview on Larry King Live after Hurricane Katrina followed, with the hosts making numerous offensive jokes about race, poverty, and Dion's perceived insensitivity.  Sean Penn's hurricane relief efforts, specifically his use of a shotgun, were also criticized.  Maury Povich then joined the show in studio.  The conversation shifted to Povich’s show, encompassing paternity tests, unusual guests, his unique approach to showcasing individuals with physical differences, anecdotes from *A Current Affair*,  and the controversial nature of his past and present shows.  Jim Norton’s HBO sitcom was again mentioned, alongside brief discussions of frequent callers Paul and Denise and their tumultuous relationship.  Callers "Sports Girl" and "Stalker Patty" also contributed, with the latter pitching a show idea about a 50-year-old virgin.  Povich concluded his appearance by offering Opie and Anthony an original *South Park* cartoon cell satirizing him for their auction.

The hosts then discussed television shows like *Entourage*, *Weeds*, and a Lisa Kudrow show, comparing cable TV's more realistic content to network programming.  The difficulties of managing DVR recordings followed, and Maury Povich briefly returned to promote his show and HBO special. The hosts compared their show's popularity to those of Oprah and Dr. Phil before one host launched into a sexually explicit monologue. This was followed by a discussion of "a couple of ladies" (possibly strippers) expected outside the studio.  Washington Capitals player Jeff Halpern called in, discussing the NHL lockout, rule changes (goalie pads, two-line pass elimination, fighting), the Islanders' Ice Girls, and other teams’ attempts to replicate the Ice Girls concept.  A lengthy segment then focused on good-natured ribbing of Paul, a new intern from the Ron and Fez show, about a previous incident where he was reportedly excessively annoying and drunk.  This involved the "laughing hat" bit.  The show concluded with the "fart game," featuring sound clips of farts and a "decoy" fart, with further discussion and anticipation for future episodes, alongside promotional mentions of items on opiananthony.com.

A subsequent segment featured the fart-identification game with Opie, Anthony, Ben, and Steve. A photo of Jim Norton with an erect penis and a picture of their waiter in what they believed to be a wig were discussed. Two women from MySexyStore.com engaged in various sexual acts on a couch ("The Liberator") with Jim Norton's participation.  Their bodies and actions were described in detail, along with the sounds they made, one woman being identified as Russian or Ukrainian. Stephen Lynch’s new CD was promoted, and a call with Barry Zito occurred during the sex acts, interspersed with descriptions of the ongoing activity.  The "fart game" and auction updates were mentioned at the show’s close.

The show’s final segment focused on a phone call with Barry Zito, promoting his "Strikeouts for Troops" charity. However, the majority of the segment involved Valentina and Nikki, two sex workers, engaging in sexual acts with the hosts and sex toys provided by MySexyStore.com.  The acts, including the use of dildos, vibrators, and lube, were described in explicit detail, along with a competition to reach orgasm first.  Fez (from the Ron and Fez show) and Steve (bringing additional sex toys) made guest appearances. The conversation included vulgar language, references to sexual acts, crude humor, and discussions of the sex workers’ potential for porn careers and sexual preferences.  The show concluded with goodbyes and plans for future segments.

[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. 
[00:05:00]  Ow, ow, ow, oh, stop, oh, stop.  I can't breathe.  Stop.  Okay, terrific.  That's the smartest thing I've ever heard anyone say about anything.  Go ahead, go and leave. Leave us. 
[00:05:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  This is XM Satellite Radio, damn it.  Yes, it is.  And we're broadcasting.  Open for business.  That's right. Jim, Kentucky, first call of the day. What do you have?  Hey, guys, did you hear John Gibson, the fear-mongering asshole from Fox News yesterday,  talking about the L.A. blackout?  No.  Oh, my God. The power went out in Metro L.A. 
[00:06:00]  He's talking to the fire marshal, the police chief.  At the fire marshal, he goes, well, they had a letter.  Al-Qaeda's done a letter like Monday saying they're going to do something with L.A. and Sydney, Australia.  So he's trying to connect that with this.  And here's these guys saying, John, no, I think someone hit a line and it took the power outage as well.  It just seemed like, you know, that was... 
[00:06:30]  Yeah, that's all it was.  There was massive power outages in L.A.  And it was a little mistake at the old power plant.  Yeah, someone cut through a line.  Yeah, that's all it was.  But the news went all over it saying, hey, terrorism!  Yeah.  All right, guys.  You guys are great.  All right.  I heard on Fox, they said, yeah, nothing's been ruled out yet, including terrorism.  Like, they love throwing that around and scaring people.  And then CNN, like, had the information really quickly. 
[00:07:00]  They just got on and said, eh, some guy cut through a line.  This is not terrorism.  Don't worry about it.  And Fox, again, trying to just keep it going.  Keep the fear going.  Fear means that people will tune in if you're scared.  It's amazing.  But it was just massive power outages that was caused by a guy that was a little tired, I think.  Oops.  How about that?  You screw up on your day's work.  We're not the only ones that screw up and then get national attention. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  You could just be working for the power, water authority, whatever.  And, uh, oops, you do something wrong, go home, and there it is for everyone to see on the news.  Oops.  Oops.  Well, I guess we've got to acknowledge Jim Norton and his birthday.  Well, today is your birthday.  We're so glad you came along.  Today is your birthday.  So we're singing your song.  When you're older, when you're bigger, why are you really growing a lot? 
[00:08:00]  When you're older, when you're smarter, there's no telling where you'll stop.  Today is your birthday.  We're so glad you came along.  Today is your birthday, and we're singing you this song.  Oof.  Make a wish.  Yeah!  Hold on, Jimmy.  We'll get to you in a second.  Breaking news here.  Tim in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, you got, uh, Howard in the meat pocket talking crap about you already. 
[00:08:30]  What are they saying today?  Uh, he said how you guys, you guys blew your gig and how no sponsors will touch you anymore.  How you guys could have been the next big thing.  Uh-huh.  What is he, fucking stupid?  You don't realize you guys been on XM for, like, almost a year.  We are the next big thing.  We've been proving it for over a year.  Well, close to a year now, I guess.  Uh, he's just a fucking bad one idiot.  Could have been the next big thing.  On regular radio?  Yeah, he said he could have took over for him or you could have been on one of his stands.  We didn't want to take over for him! 
[00:09:00]  We do our own fucking thing.  Exactly.  We don't take over for Howard.  We do what we do.  Fucking pompous asshole.  Funny how he says no sponsors will touch you, but, you know, I find that hard to believe.  I guess he just needs to listen more during the day.  And we will be much bigger because we did get fired from commercial radio.  Absolutely.  Because he did everything he possibly can behind the scenes to make sure we weren't going to get big.  And guess what? 
[00:09:30]  We still got big.  And the phones just exploded.  And we'd have been off of, uh...  Dude, we just had 12 phones ringing.  We got a big topic here and the phones just went...  Yeah.  I didn't hang up on that guy.  Yeah, they're all calling back.  The, uh, the truth of the matter is...  Stop.  We'd have been fired anyway for something else.  I mean, regular radio just changed so much in the time that we were on it that, uh, there was no way we could have kept that role going. 
[00:10:00]  We'd have either been fired or had to tame the show down so much that it would have lost a lot of what people, uh, listened for.  And we'd ended up like, uh, a bunch of jocks out there.  Just castrated, doing, uh, marginal material.  And look who's doing that.  Howard.  And what's he doing?  He's leaving the medium.  Why would we want to stay on the medium that he is leaving for the same reasons? 
[00:10:30]  You know, it's ridiculous.  No, we wouldn't have been the next big thing on regular radio.  We'd have self-destructed on that medium or, or we'd have left.  And we were quite big.  Because our hands were tied.  We were quite big in our own right on commercial radio.  Yeah.  And our contract would have ended about a year ago.  And most likely we would have jumped to satellite radio no matter what.  You know what he's saying, Opie?  He's saying that we would have been entitled to some of the antelope carcass out on the plains of the Serengeti. 
[00:11:00]  He's been nibbling on it.  And now that he's leaving, he is looking at us and thinking, they would have been able to take a little snack off of this thing.  It's, uh, it's, it's his pompous, uh, mindset.  By the way, Eric Logan's calling in, hopefully very soon.  And he is guaranteeing us that we will have a bigger audience on satellite radio than Howard Stern.  He's guaranteeing it.  Absolutely will.  Because XM is in a much better position as a company.  They just made a huge announcement yesterday.  The boys at Sirius are crying their eyes out today. 
[00:11:30]  They got fucked hard yesterday.  Mmm.  Yesterday they got fucked hard.  Yeah.  If you're not a hockey fan, to you, it's like, whatever.  But we basically took, uh, no, we did.  We took hockey away from, um, Sirius Satellite Radio.  And you combine that with, uh, Canada, um, you know, um, giving XM and Sirius, uh, licenses to, to have satellite radio in Canada.  Yeah.  That's a big win for XM to have, um, you know, to be heard in Canada and be the exclusive home of hockey. 
[00:12:00]  Have hockey up there in Canada.  They love their hockey.  About the sponsors.  Is one reason, like, maybe people, he's talking about sponsors and you guys can't get sponsors.  Is because, going on Sirius, he has to have commercials.  So he has to justify, this is why I have commercials.  Well, those guys would, but they can't.  Yeah.  You gotta pay a big salary there, so you gotta have a lot of commercials.  You know what?  Anthony and I and Jimmy, we make a good living doing this.  Mm-hmm.  We make a really good living doing this.  Howard is gonna make a boatload of money.  We all know that.  A hell of a lot more than us.  But they have to justify it as a company. 
[00:12:30]  Exactly, Jimmy.  You make a great point.  So they have to sell commercials.  No, he doesn't.  And that...  Huh?  I said no, he doesn't.  Jimmy doesn't make a good point?  Nah.  Why?  I do.  I just don't want to give it to him.  But I do.  I do.  So they gotta justify it.  And, you know, so they gotta sell a shitload of commercials to, you know, to pay his salary.  And, quite frankly, satellite, you know, radio listeners aren't gonna be happy when they  start sitting through 15, 20 minutes of commercials on satellite radio.  Absolutely.  When we first started here in the satellite biz, Opie, and I like to call it the satellite 
[00:13:00]  biz, I was a little worried about the fact that we didn't have all these commercials to  take the break.  I was a little worried that perhaps we weren't gonna be able to fill the show up with just  us talking and doing things.  It was a little nerve-wracking at first, you know?  So, but now, we do the show, we take minimal amounts of breaks, and it's cool.  It works out.  I think he's mistaking that for the fact that we can't get sponsors. 
[00:13:30]  We like putting on a show for four hours and giving the people that.  First of all, I don't think he's capable of that, to tell you the truth.  Get out there and actually do a show without so many very long breaks during his show.  Why do you think he bitches about management every day and other radio shows and the FCC  and this and that?  Because he's a lazy, lazy broadcaster.  He doesn't want to do a radio show anymore.  You can't make that much money and have been in the business for that long and had that 
[00:14:00]  type of success that he's had for that long and not get a little lazy, you know?  You kind of look at the check, you look at what you gotta do, it's just a matter of showing  up.  You know, that's pretty much it.  Someone keep track of what he does today and you'll see.  He'll bitch about this person, he'll bitch about this radio show, the government's  after me, blah, blah, blah, they might find me again, blah, blah, blah.  And then you get to the end of a show and you realize as a fan, wait a minute, wait a  minute, my favorite radio host did absolutely nothing today. 
[00:14:30]  What happened?  Absolutely nothing.  It's lazy.  Absolute laziness.  Yeah, well there you go.  Keep talking.  He's a little frustrated because we are the pioneers of satellite radio.  He wasn't first.  And XM is a much better company.  But he decided not to come here because we were here.  What a pussy.  A little baby.  We have the better technology.  We have the better programming.  Mm-hmm.  And we will have a bigger audience when he goes to satellite radio.  It's a fact.  It's an absolute fact. 
[00:15:00]  That's just the numbers that are there.  That's it.  There's no denying that.  You can't spin that.  Oh, all right.  All right.  Now you got us.  That's true.  Yeah.  Martha.  Wait till you see what we do next.  I'm just going to listen to Martha Stewart.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Jason in Delaware.  I don't get it.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Jason.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  What do you guys think about Howard hiring all his enemies?  All his enemies?  No, we heard you.  Oh, cool. 
[00:15:30]  Just showing that he's full of shit and he's a hypocrite.  All these guys that he bitched and complained about he's now going to hire?  Yeah.  What is that about?  And by the way, XM did pass on Bubba a long time ago, so that's no big win for Sirius.  Now, it's in his best interest to promote these guys, to get on on a daily basis with  promos and recordings and promote these guys that he's hiring.  These are the same guys that you could pull tape on and hear him ripping them for being 
[00:16:00]  ripoffs, unfunny, untalented.  So what's the truth?  Is the truth that these people do suck and he identified that and talked about it, but  now it's in his best interest financially to tell his listeners to lie again to his  listeners and tell them that these people are funny and entertaining and worth a listen,  worth paying for?  Or was he lying about them sucking and being ripoffs and they are good?  You know, either way, it's not very good for Howie. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't make him look very good.  No, not at all.  But he gets a big payday, so congratulations for that.  Who wouldn't want that, right?  The big house in the Hamptons?  Hoo-hoo.  The Howie Copter taking you there from Manhattan every day?  To the Howie Copter, Robin.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  It's landing.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I had to get the rotors extended so it's got to come off another nine feet because it  would chop my lanky head off. 
[00:17:00]  Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  I wonder what that hole had to say about this whole thing.  Oh, my.  Oh, you're so right.  Oh, Howard.  Well, yes, they did.  Shut up.  Shut up, you whole.  Hot pocket.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All these years, you weren't even able to do your own show.  That's pretty sad.  Absolutely sad.  And if Howard wants material today, why doesn't he just talk about what happened in that emergency room that day? 
[00:17:30]  Why don't you tell your listeners what happened on that fine day,  the night before you signed a huge contract to stay with Infinity Broadcasting?  Remember, you had Mel on the show the next morning.  Everyone was happy.  I think you guys were pouring champagne because you re-signed and signed another five-year deal.  But what happened the night before, Howard, if you want to be real and honest with your listeners,  and you're looking for material today?  I think there was just a huge hypocrisy on that night because how many years has he bashed people for being bad parents? 
[00:18:00]  You know?  Anytime some kid gets in the news, a celebrity's kid, and he would just bash them as being a bad parent  and try to come across as the great father, and then one of his kids had a little trouble.  That's all we're saying.  That's all we're saying.  And, oh boy, it sure made him look like a bad dad.  Maybe that whole divorce thing was weighing on the children,  and maybe you weren't there enough to take care of them, 
[00:18:30]  and maybe they were looking for alternatives.  Looks like you called in some favors now, huh?  Yeah.  You called in some favors.  You asked your buddy at Page Six to help you out, huh?  Help you out.  Maybe not splash this across the pages.  Maybe keep some pictures out of the paper that day, huh?  It's just another example of the hypocrisy.  Ah, we know something happened at the Jingle Ball.  We don't know for sure, whether it was alcohol or drugs.  We don't know.  We know it was something, though.  Howie knows it's something.  Why don't you talk about that today, Howard?  There's some material. 
[00:19:00]  We'll give you material today.  And go.  Go ahead.  Have fun with that.  If you guys want to drive him nuts, call his show right now and go,  Howard, so what happened in the emergency room that day after the Jingle Ball a few years back?  Something to do with a daughter.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, Robin.  We can play with the best of them, Howie.  You know that, you faggot.  Someone's suggesting Howie take the Howie Copter down to New Orleans and pick up a new sidekick. 
[00:19:30]  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Put her in the basket, Robin.  The sidekick goes in the basket.  Anyway, it's a very exciting day here at XM Satellite Radio for a couple reasons.  Put the fucking shwoogie in the basket.  Eric Logan should be calling in soon to talk about the Canadian deal and the hockey deal.  We're trying to be honest. 
[00:20:00]  Everyone knows it's not the real Eric Logan.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  It's a fake one.  Another fucking loser that does commercial radio.  So, it's easy.  You just go on the air and lie about anything.  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.  So, where is Elo?  He'll be calling soon.  And, of course, it's Jimmy's.  It's a weird day because it's Jimmy's last day for a while.  Yeah.  But not really because you'll be calling every day or as much as you can. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, this is my last day until I'm gone.  Actually, this is the longest I'm gone.  This first hunk is the longest time I'm actually gone, which is three weeks.  Oh, three weeks without a little Jimmy Norton.  I'm going to miss you.  But then I'm back for a week.  I'll miss you.  And then I'm gone for two and then back for one and then gone for two and then back for  one.  What is your schedule out there as far as your day?  I don't know.  I don't even know what episodes I'm in.  I know that I think it's like a 10 o'clock call time, L.A. time.  And usually we do, if you do a table read, you probably have an early day, which is like  Monday or Tuesday. 
[00:21:00]  And then, you know, Wednesday or Thursday you rehearse.  I'm just guessing we probably won't get many phone calls from little sleeping Jimmy Norton.  I'll wake up and call.  It just depends on what, like the days I probably won't be able to call will be Thursday, Friday,  so we shoot for two days because there's no commercials.  You shoot for two days.  Well, instead of like one day, it's a sitcom.  That's where they put the camera and take up the moving pictures.  All four of them, yeah.  All four of those little cameras, those little rascals.  Four cameras shoot.  Yeah, but they do two live audience shoots because they have an extra seven minutes to  fill because there's no commercials.  At the end of the shoot, when the audience is there, do you all come out, hold hands, 
[00:21:30]  and bow?  We don't hold hands, but they do introduce us.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And you look up and wave to the people in the high seats?  Yeah.  And you give them a thumbs up and wave and then turn around and run off?  Yeah.  Do a big theatrical bow?  Right, right.  Yeah, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  Thank you.  They bow.  I apologize.  How exciting.  Jimmy's off to Hollywood. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just don't know how many episodes I'm in, so there's going to be weeks where I think  I'm going to be gone.  I'm actually going to be back.  And then you'll be calling the show because this is perfect for you.  I mean, it's like 4.30 in L.A. right now.  Right.  You're still up.  Who are you kidding?  You're going to start going to bed early?  I went to bed at 2.30 last night.  Oh, Jesus.  After receiving a massage from a girl from Trinidad, I swear to God, she looked like  Mabel King if she was skinnier and had legs.  It was disgusting.  100 bucks.  No happy ending.  No.  No.  I see.  Wait, they came to your place? 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And you paid 100 and no happy ending?  No happy ending.  The happy ending was, she said goodnight.  She left.  She was ghastly.  Ugh.  Jesus.  That was my night.  Doesn't pan out.  You got all your girls lined up for L.A.?  Nothing.  Nothing?  Yeah.  You'll do fine, Jimmy.  I think so.  You'll do fine.  I'll be good out there.  You got to work, man.  Good news, though.  We're going to hire a hole temporarily to sit in your seat.  Some slit.  Some slit.  We'll just be there just babbling.  Oh, God.  Wrecking the flow of the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:23:00]  We figure if you're not here, we'll just all suffer.  Yeah.  Listeners included.  Where's that audio of a hole on a radio show?  Where's Eric?  He knows where that one is.  Where's Eric?  I see Jimmy as a breakaway character.  You know that?  You know, a little character on a little sitcom many years ago was just supposed to show up  for a few episodes.  That character?  Arthur Fonzarelli, my friend.  Good point.  That's right, Anthony.  The Fonz. 
[00:23:30]  That's right.  Also, George Jefferson.  Yes, right?  Maud.  All of a sudden, they're on All in the Family.  People look and go, wow, that's a great character.  And where do they go?  Their own show.  Moving on up, Jimmy.  Moving on up.  I'm going to be a little bit player.  Hopefully, it's a good show.  I've got good feedback with the pilot, so hopefully it'll go well.  When you get your spin-off, the Jimmy Norton show, I want to be able to have a little guest  thing as a DJ when you go on a radio show.  We'll be a DJ. 
[00:24:00]  Something like that.  Then you find out I'm a prick to work for.  I'm starting to scream, don't you know what your motivation is?  Right.  You'd be a real scumbag.  Give you guys a shitty little trailer.  I'll try to do the Jimmy Norton acting school.  I'll be, oh, well, we're here on the air.  Well, we've decorated the studio for Jim Norton's kind of going away party slash happy birthday  party.  Let's just say it's a birthday bash.  Everyone's in a festive birthday mood. 
[00:24:30]  We have hats.  Hats everywhere.  We all got laughing hats.  We all got laughing hats.  It's birthday fucking laughing hats.  Jesus.  Wonderful.  All the guys have one.  There's streamers, the colorful streamers behind Jimmy.  It's a true birthday bash.  And on your little mic stand.  And at this time, here comes the special birthday cake.  Oh, look, a big cake.  What a little Jimmy Norton.  What the hell?  Oh, my God.  What kind of cake is that?  This cake is disturbing.  Wait. 
[00:25:00]  Eric, get a really good picture of that cake because we've got to get that online.  Is that a tranny cake?  It's a tranny cake.  I'm laughing because it has four candles.  Holy shit.  It's a cake with big, huge boobs.  Probably like full D boobs.  Yeah.  And then a big freaking schlong.  With little chocolate jimmies around it.  It looks like cubes.  It says, happy birthday, big dick daddy, right?  Oh, Jesus.  That is fantastic. 
[00:25:30]  Are you going to go pictures, Eric?  Yep.  I would get one from the other side, too, you know.  Get one from the...  I've got to take one of these.  This is fantastic.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  Who's eating the cock?  Like you have to ask.  I want the letter H.  I want the...  Who the hell is going to eat that, seriously?  What is it made of?  Oh, I don't know.  Dig in. 
[00:26:00]  Why don't you dig in there, Jimmy?  I don't know if it's edible.  It certainly is.  Oh, stop it.  It's a cock.  He just bit the head off the cock.  We got the video.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That is...  That is like...  That's deeply disturbing.  The cake should have come in a robe.  What does it taste like, Jimmy? 
[00:26:30]  Mmm.  Good chocolate.  Is it?  Chocolate.  Chocolate.  Oh, there you go.  If you want to...  The boobs look like bad tranny implant boobs.  The nipples are all pointing the wrong way.  That is a disturbing, disturbing cake.  Horrible.  Genius idea.  Tranny cake.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  It's...  Oh, it's fantastic.  It's a little Jimmy Norton's going away party.  You think the cake's good that way?  Flip it over.  Oh, I like a piece of cake. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  I will not be having any of that cake.  Oh, it looks good.  Any self-respecting bakery wouldn't bake a cake like that.  Not a self-respecting bakery in the East Village.  No, of course not.  It's Fudgy the Tranny.  Yeah.  That's great.  Get a Covell Tranny cake.  There you go, Jimmy.  Start cutting up the cake for everybody.  Let's go to the phones real fast. 
[00:27:30]  DJ in New Jersey.  DJ.  Hey, oh, hey.  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Eric.  Happy yoga, kid.  Thanks, fella.  I think instead of having the Army call, Howard, you should have a little Jimmy call and say,  you know, I heard something about a daughter.  You had a daughter.  I don't know.  Your daughter did something.  Something with your daughter.  I don't know.  I think that'd be good.  Pump it out.  All right, bro.  Let's say hi to Joe in Jersey.  A lot of Jersey calls today.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Joe.  I was just listening to the idiot for a second, and he had some guy on promoting a website. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And in exact words, this is like an army of men we have.  And Rodman's like, yeah, Howard, it is an army.  We have an army.  So he's using you guys' terms again.  I guess he's ripping you guys off.  Tell him, Jimmy.  Well, you know, the Army concept in radio is not a new one.  But I'll tell you what's new in radio, because we always improve on what's been out there.  We've done that our whole careers.  We have what's called pests.  Yeah.  And they're much, much, much, much more annoying than anyone's army. 
[00:28:30]  Anyone's army, in the old sense of the word in radio, is somebody who has their bumper sticker on their bumper.  They would consider them their army.  Right.  That's not really an army.  An army is a collection of annoying pests that will just destroy anything that interferes with this program in any way.  That's an army.  They can be deployed for missions, and not just some schlep that's putting a bumper sticker on their bumper. 
[00:29:00]  See, our pests are well organized.  You know, other radio stations, they have an army.  It's cute.  Hey, getting the army together for a happy hour.  They're a name on a mailing list.  That's pretty much it.  Beer is going to be $1.02.  Yeah.  You should see what our pests do.  You should see.  A little project for the pests today.  Just keep calling K-Rock in New York City and asking the screener, because Howard's too much of a pussy.  He won't put any of you on the air. 
[00:29:30]  He's chicken shit when it comes right down to it, and he's on a very long delay.  But get to the screener, because then the screener will have to convey the boy, Gary, who will lick Howie's ass and tell him what's going on.  Yeah.  So everyone should just call K-Rock and ask if Howard's going to talk about what happened to his daughter the night after the jingle ball.  He wants to play.  We play again today.  No problem.  We know this drives him absolutely nuts.  Oh, God.  Jeremiah from Greenpoint brings up a good point.  Does this mean you guys are going to have to sign hockey pucks at the next appearance? 
[00:30:00]  Those are easy, though, because they're flat.  Flat on the top?  That's easy.  Baseball, it's like, you know, I don't know if you know this.  It's kind of curved.  Do we really want to hand out hockey pucks to the listeners, though?  I see those coming back.  Well, with the brilliant marketing department we have at XM, look, we know we're at the better company,  but, you know, we also know that we need to make some improvements as well.  I'm sure they're working on the XM hockey pucks as we speak. 
[00:30:30]  Jimmy's cutting off a heap and helping of scrotum.  Where are you?  You went for the taint.  I went for the leg.  You went for the leg?  How about a wing?  That's part upper leg and part scrotum.  Oh, my.  That cake has to be the most disturbing cake I've ever seen.  Dude, this cake is so good.  It's really, yeah.  A little tranny cake.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  All right, let's see how to Ed in Jersey.  Ed, what's up? 
[00:31:00]  Yo, I just wanted to wish a sweet kiss a happy birthday there.  Thanks, fella.  Hey, Jimmy, you fucking rock, man.  Thank you, bud.  All right.  Oh, by the way, I tried to call Howard a little while ago.  Yeah.  And his screener was like, no way are we putting any of you guys on.  I know.  I know.  That's what he does.  He's so fucking brave.  We've been calling him out for years, and the pussy just doesn't know how to take it.  Let's go to Evil Trucker in Dallas.  Evil Trucker, what's up?  Hey, fellas. 
[00:31:30]  How's it going, ONA?  Hi.  Wanted to get an update on the attack on that Lex and Larry or whatever the fuck the name of that show is.  Evil Trucker, you change your name like every week, don't you?  I don't know.  Occasionally when the moody hits me.  Aren't you also known as Max?  That's right.  Wow.  I tried to three-way on to Lex and Terry.  I was going to try to drop a bomb on them, but it fucked up on me, so, oh, well.  Shit happens.  Lex and Terry got in way over their head, and they backed way the fuck off. 
[00:32:00]  I was going to call them about my selfish bitch girlfriend, Moira, but the damn thing hung up on me, so.  He was blind.  Oh, you're rough.  Don't be it.  Don't be it.  Don't get on hold.  All right.  Hey, we got to cut you off today, Evil Trucker, because on the hotline, it's our buddy, it's our pal, and sometimes he's our boss.  It's Eric Logan, everyone.  Hey, boy.  Elo with the radio voice.  Hi, Elo.  Hey, guys.  Jimmy, happy birthday.  Oh, thank you, sir.  How are you? 
[00:32:30]  I'm great.  I have to be the first to tell you that I'm going to sorely miss you the next three weeks.  Oh, thank you.  I'll miss you guys, man.  But I must concur that if you don't call it 4.30 West Coast time, you're an absolute wuss.  Yeah, I'll definitely call them.  He'll be calling in a lot.  He'll still have his fingers involved in this program.  Elo?  Yes, sir?  Before we start, I have something to discuss with you.  Okay.  Opie's informed me that you two were chatting about my shoelaces.  I was really becoming overly concerned about the shoelace and the street juice that oozes off the eyelid. 
[00:33:00]  We haven't talked about this on the area?  No.  I took a phone call from Eric Logan, and he's working on some big things for Anthony and I,  but he's like, I was listening to the show yesterday, and Anthony's really starting to scare me with that shoelace thing that he brought up.  Do you want to bring that up again?  Of course.  As I said, when I walk through the streets of New York City and if my shoelace becomes untied, I then have to throw my sneakers away.  Right.  Because the GAC that is in the shoelace, even if you unlace it and try to put new laces in, the GAC will squeegee off the lace and get into the sneakers. 
[00:33:30]  Well, the reason why you said that was because all the GAC that's caked on do Opie's rollerblades.  Right, the rollerblades.  The disgusting, GAC'd-up rollerblades.  I got $5,000 for those rollerblades yesterday as part of that auction, so let's calm down.  And, Elo, how long have you been in radio?  How long have I been in radio?  Yeah, yeah.  A couple weeks.  A couple weeks, not very long.  A couple weeks, depends upon who you ask. 
[00:34:00]  Because there have been pretty big exaggerations as to my habits, and I really don't throw my sneakers away.  I'm letting the audience know.  I'm tearing down the walls.  I've never thrown away a pair of sneakers because my shoelace became untied.  I had people at the appearance.  How many times have you thought about it, Bob?  I've thought about it.  All right, that's all we know.  I've had people at the appearance at B.B. King's come up to me and actually pull their hands back and go, 
[00:34:30]  Hey, no shaking, I know, no touching.  Or go, Can I take a picture?  Don't worry, I won't touch you.  People are petrified that I will freak out if I'm touched or they try to shake my hand or anything.  Well, if you wear a bubble suit on its appearances, it actually does send off a kind of...  You think it's the bubble suit?  All right, I'll try to lose that.  I think the bubble suit could be a problem.  It forced you to shake a lot of hands on Friday at B.B. King's, I noticed.  Well, that's good.  My fears are alleviated.  But if, you know, because it's all fine and well for radio, but the second my boss starts thinking I'm nuts 
[00:35:00]  and might reconsider certain things that might make me money or more successful,  then I have to lay it on the line.  Elo, knock it off.  Okay.  It's off.  Well, because then Elo is like, you know, if we do this thing, you guys might have to fly around the country a little bit.  And I don't want Anthony backing out of a flight because why?  Well, I can just see Howard Hughes.  You know, you're going to walk on a plane and all of a sudden I'm going to get a phone call.  It's like, well, my shoelace, you know, touched the tarmac.  I can't go.  And I'm like, well, we had this interview set up with Tom Cruise. 
[00:35:30]  I can help tell him we have Gak on the shoestring.  This was an actual conversation I had with Eric Logan.  I forgot to.  Yeah.  We forgot to bring this to the air.  No, we'll see him ahead.  You will be a superstar, so don't worry.  Hey, Logan, with that fine radio voice of yours, what was your biggest job on air?  Biggest job on air was, I think, middays, Oklahoma City.  And then I filled in and did mornings in Seattle for like a week. 
[00:36:00]  And then the SVP of programming came in and said I was the worst personality he ever heard in radio, so he took me off.  Did you do any bits?  No, just basically what I'm doing now, which is just be the retarded boss.  That's the one I play well the best.  Was that it?  Would you spin records?  Oh, yeah.  No, it was hillbilly records, country music, the whole thing.  Yeah, but you must have had some kind of feature, no?  No, no.  I was just, you know, walking it up, as we like to say, kissing the post.  Kissing the post.  Just like Bruce.  You know, only can be as good as Bruce Kelly.  That's what we would try to be. 
[00:36:30]  We just got distracted because...  They're tasing some guy on TV.  A big fat guy that was in a love bug.  He was in a Baja bug.  Oh, that was a Baja?  Yeah, and they blew his tires out, and then he got out of the vehicle and they tased him.  That's a good tasing.  No, he realized in his business really early, like, you guys are great at on the air.  I suck.  So I better do something else if I want to stay on radio, so...  Hey, Elo, will we have a bigger audience than Howard Stern?  Without question.  Thank you.  I'll absolutely guarantee it.  Thank you.  Without question. 
[00:37:00]  Without question.  And you want to get into this hockey slash XM Canada thing?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I mean, I think that, you know, you guys briefly touched on it this morning, but yesterday we  announced a very long-term deal with National Hockey League, which will be a huge thing for  us.  As you guys know, hockey is coming back this year.  There's a terrific resurgence in the game.  There is a lot of excitement around the game.  There's been a lot of rule changes in the game, which you guys probably talked about  already, but more importantly, there was an opportunity through the agreement that the 
[00:37:30]  NHL had with the dog, and we were able to, you know, cut a deal that provided us the  games this year, so we will carry the hockey games this year with Sirius, and then the  final eight years of our ten-year deal, it will flip to an exclusive arrangement where  we'll have the games exclusively.  That's kind of nice, considering we're going to be in Canada, huh?  Yeah, and, you know, if you think about it, if you say, you know, what is the most  important sport to the Canadian subscribers or potential subscribers in Canada? 
[00:38:00]  Oh, I got the answer.  Jimmy, do you have any guesses?  Ope, have a guess first.  I'll guess second.  Okay, go ahead.  I think it's the one where they throw that thing, and then they sweep really hard.  Oh!  Curling?  Curling!  Curling!  That's my guess.  Now, Ope, I'm sorry to say, I think I heard a rumor that Sirius is picking up curling.  Curling, that's where they're going.  Because they lost the hockey.  Curling.  They're going to give away those brooms so they can sweep, you know, on the little track.  Yeah.  All right, we all know it's hockey, but here's the question. 
[00:38:30]  What is the number two sport in Canada?  Hatch paint.  It can't be their dumb football, is it?  No, I think it's CFL, actually.  You think it really is the Canadian football league?  Yeah, it's the CFL with the Grey Cup.  Ugh.  Yeah, but I mean, again, it's such a distant second.  I mean, the CFL is fine and all, but hockey, the ratings that hockey pulls when they're on  television and radio in Toronto and Montreal and Calgary are phenomenal.  It's like a Super Bowl every night. 
[00:39:00]  It's like 20, 25 shares.  Everybody watches hockey in Canada.  It's just a way of life.  That was a definite Eric Logan quote.  That's right.  Everybody watches hockey in Canada.  Yeah.  Take that to the bank.  And if you don't, people are going, why didn't you watch?  Yeah, right on.  No, but it's a huge deal.  And, you know, if you think about, you know, what is the must-have piece of content going  into a new country, you know, specifically like Canada, and without question, it's hockey.  I mean, you know, it's the Canadian pastime. 
[00:39:30]  Baseball, for us, was a must-have in America, the American pastime.  So, I mean, we feel great about it, and one of the things that, you know, we told the  NHL, which is going to be great, is we're building a 24-7 NHL channel, much like our MLB  home plate channel, that will be year-round talk about hockey and call-in shows, and the  MLB home plate channel has been a huge success.  So, we're basically looking at what we did there and kind of replicate the same sort of  strategy with the NHL, and they absolutely love the idea, and it's going to be terrific.  Looking to get some stars involved? 
[00:40:00]  Absolutely.  Lots of stars.  I know you guys have got some pretty big interviews today, so.  Yeah, we got Mike Milbury from the Islanders, and what's his name down there in Washington?  Jeff Halprant?  Halprant?  Yeah, I don't know him too well, actually.  He's the starting center for the Washington Capitals.  See, I don't follow the Capitals.  I'm an Islander fan.  Well, there you go.  You're going to have a heavyweight on.  You might as well try to sign Messier immediately.  Yeah, well.  He announced his retirement yesterday. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, that's a huge thing, so.  When does the whole platform start in Canada?  Well, we haven't announced the launch date in Canada.  We just got the license last week approved, but we will be carrying hockey when the puck  drops on October 5th.  How long does it take to get XM in Canada now?  Well, I mean, once we go live, we'll immediately start selling radios vis-a-vis a lot of different  outlets, and then we're working with, obviously, the automotive manufacturers and those deals  as well.  So, we'll be having a huge rollout and a launch date and everything coming soon. 
[00:41:00]  Listen to this corporate answer.  Yeah.  That doesn't answer the question.  Yes, it does.  It tells you it's coming soon.  And did you see the little doggy company stock just kind of fell?  Yeah.  Had a little problem yesterday.  Oh, Elo.  It was doing good right up until the announcement.  Oh, who knew?  Elo fucked them hard yesterday.  Who knew?  How sad do you think they were over there yesterday?  This one, I mean, I don't know.  I can't tell you how they feel, but I can tell you that this probably was unexpected. 
[00:41:30]  When you read all the press that both companies had about going into Canada, hockey was a critical  piece of the game.  Yes, I saw that on the releases.  Yeah, and so that's why we became incredibly aggressive and just felt that it was a must-have  piece of content for us.  And so we really stepped up to the plate and wanted to go get it.  And, you know, you've got to credit Hugh Panaro, and you've got to credit our Canadian  partners, you know, CSR, John Bittoff, and Steve Tapp, those guys that really stepped  up. 
[00:42:00]  It's like the Oscars.  It's like the Oscars.  He's thanking people.  Absolutely.  By the way, Chubsy Ubsy from Jersey, number two sport in Canada, lacrosse.  Lacrosse.  There you go.  How about that?  Yeah, we're working on that as well.  We're going to have a lacrosse channel next.  Lacrosse channel.  Lacrosse.  A sport that never took off, unfortunately.  I love lacrosse.  No, but Hugh, you're here on the eastern seaboard as you guys know.  Yes, sir.  You know how great it is?  I can go up there and do gigs now for a third of the money I'd make here.  Right.  For Canadian.  Yikes.  We can give you a 50 American, eh? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, by the way, the pictures are up.  If you want to check out Jimmy's birthday cake.  Ooh.  A tranny birthday cake.  Is this a transsexual birthday cake?  Yeah.  It's hot.  It's deeply disturbing.  The pictures are now up on opianthony.com.  Oh, boy.  Foundrymusic.com.  I'm looking at the picture.  It says, happy birthday, big dick daddy.  Oh, wow.  What you're looking at is a birthday cake, believe it or not.  Oh, my God.  It kind of looks like a blow-up doll or something.  Yep.  The midsection.  Oh, and there's Jimmy taking a bite of his birthday cake. 
[00:43:00]  Jesus Christ.  This birthday celebration has all the features.  Wow.  That's a great shot.  That is disturbing as all hell.  God.  That is so wrong.  All right, Elo.  Anything else you want to announce today?  No, I have plenty more in my hip pocket, but all in due time.  You guys have blue sky and a lot of stuff?  Oh, you know, we whiteboard around here.  Whiteboarding it?  Whiteboarding is what we call it.  What the hell is whiteboarding?  I don't know.  Do you know those giant rooms? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, does he hate that?  Well, if you remember, last time he got us.  Yep.  He didn't fall for it, so we had to get him today.  And you know he was prepared.  You know he was trying to figure out when it was going to happen.  When he should do it.  Right.  He couldn't stop himself, though, when it came to corporate talk.  Right.  He just can't help it.  Whiteboarding.  I guess we're going to have to leave you all hanging on what whiteboarding is.  And I hear Sirius also picking up duck pin bowling over there in Canada, trying to compensate 
[00:44:00]  for losing hockey.  How do you lose hockey when you're going into Canada?  What assholes?  It's like really the only reason you want to go into Canada is to broadcast hockey.  As far as satellite radio goes, this is a huge deal today.  And they're celebrating big time in Washington.  And they're not happy over at the Little Doggy Company.  Nine.  I'm not a hockey fan, but it's baseball in Canada.  Yeah.  I just feel like it was profound.  Yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Well, I was just about to say, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's Jimmy's birthday today.  Yeah.  When we get back.  You know, Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.  Well, that cake is.  Well, it has nothing to do with what we're talking about, you all.  Now, now, hold on.  She's commenting on the cake, Opie.  You're going to get us all in trouble.  No, no.  No, we're not.  It's the tranny cake.  It's the tranny cake.  You see the boobs on it?  Well, you get your mind out of the gutter.  But they're boobs on the tranny cake. 
[00:45:00]  No, that's not right.  And look at the cock, for Christ's sake.  It's a huge one.  Jimmy bit the tip off of it, too.  You guys have to stop.  I know.  And there's pictures of it online now.  Pictures of Jimmy biting a cock.  Yeah.  And you can go to opieanthony.com to check those pictures out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're really, really funny.  Well, whatever.  You whole.  Oh, please.  Women only do that in porno movies.  No, no.  Sometimes it happens in real life.  You know, you're right.  Well, it's about time you say we're right, you fucking hole. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, that laugh.  That's all that's going against you, isn't it?  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  This is Jimmy's replacement, by the way.  That's what you're going to have to deal with for three and a half years.  How do you cash your check?  Guys, I can't take this.  I got to say you got to stop.  Well, why don't you say something that we could really get into here.  A comment on it.  I have a little sense of humor and all, but I just don't think it's funny to make fun of the mentally challenged.  We're not.  Oh.  We're making fun of you.  What's so funny about flatulence anyway? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, the farts?  When Jimmy farts into the mic.  Oh, come on.  Well, after the break, we're doing the fart game.  Oh, good.  In honor of Jimmy's last day for a while.  One-track mind.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you may think it's funny, but I just have to draw the line.  I mean, some things should just not be talked about and aren't funny.  Right, right.  Like your smelly twat?  Oh, God.  I don't think that's the right thing to do.  Stop it.  No, no.  Okay.  It's not funny.  All right, on the show today, Maury Povich in studio at 830.  Oh, I'll tell you what the problem with those magazines is. 
[00:46:30]  Real women do not look like that.  What are you talking about?  We're talking about Maury Povich.  If I had a trainer and I had somebody doing my hair and makeup all day, I would look like  a supermodel, too.  You know?  But we're talking about Maury Povich.  He's coming in today.  Come on.  Stop drooling.  Over Maury?  You're wrecking our show again, you whole.  You're ruining everything.  I think a real man likes a strong, powerful, intelligent woman.  Shut up.  Wow.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[00:47:00]  How do you know God was a man?  That old man.  Yeah, right.  Whatever.  Oh, please.  Whatever.  All right, we're going to take a break, Anthony.  Good.  Well, they didn't know that.  Jimmy's celebration continues.  His last day for a while before he flies out to L.A.  Ben?  There's more to come, too.  We haven't finished.  More surprises for all Jim.  More surprises for Jimmy today.  Ben, I like surprises.  I swear, you're always just like little boys.  I like surprises.  When are you just going to grow up already?  Yeah, well, if that were me, I would just have to pull a Lorena Bobbitt. 
[00:47:30]  Cut your cock off.  Well, Jimmy did that to the cake already, so.  Oh.  Dude, whoever did that, that is hilarious.  Yeah, it's perfect.  It is the perfect sidekick hole.  That's right.  That every one market sensation has.  The hole that wrecks everything.  All right.  Want to play the fart game when we get back? 
[00:48:00]  Of course.  Like sand through the hourglass, so is the O.A. virus.  I've been so annoyed as a Yankee fan.  I used to love John Sterling.  I thought he did some interesting...  Color call?  Color call.  I'm sorry.  But he became a caricature of himself and began to annoy me so much.  I used to love the guy.  I think he actually calls a really good game.  A lot of people disagree.  I think he's very good.  But when he does the home run calls, he gets so wrapped up in his own shtick. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Like, you know.  Like, it's not about you, douchebag.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  At times, if you don't know where the ball is going, that makes sense.  But when it becomes...  It is high.  It is far.  All right.  Is it?  Is it gone?  The sportscasters now want to be the star.  The stars, you know?  Yes.  That's what it's all about.  We get it.  He could go all...  I understand the way, shithead.  He could go all... 
[00:49:00]  Cuddy?  Cuddy?  He has a 20-yard lead on the guy chasing him.  Exactly.  I think he's going to make it.  That Christopher E. blown into a straw behind him.  Right.  Trying to move his wheelchair to catch him.  I think he's going to score.  That's so good.  He could go all...  He sort of takes away from those special moments.  And it's like, you know, I've just seen the tape.  He goes off the...  Fucko.  I made the fucko list of Chris Berman.  Men is hard.  Men is hard. 
[00:49:30]  And when guys hit home runs...  Oh, this is the worst.  Like, if you guys were both up and you hit home runs...  Yeah.  Which you do in my eyes every day.  Of course.  Thanks for having me.  He would say...  He would say...  They hit home runs...  A back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  Dude.  Dude.  Back-to-back and a belly-to-belly. 
[00:50:00]  He goes, and a...  And a belly-to-belly.  Back-to-back.  And Andy Hawkins has been knocked out of the game.  Holy shit.  And a belly-to-belly.  Ugh.  Too bad Ben didn't hit a home run.  A scalp-to-scalp.  And a hog-to-hog.  Lou Gehrig hits one.  Oh, shaky running around the bases. 
[00:50:30]  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Ramon.  Bring Bam Tino a home run.  Andy hit.  It is high.  It is far.  It is gone.  Back-to-back and fixed belly-to-belly. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, my God.  And stapled belly-to-belly.  Yes, they call me the Bear-Beno.  And Carly, she hits another Bear-Bones home run.  Erby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right. 
[00:51:30]  All right.  Oh, real quick.  I want to thank everyone that bid on some of those items in the first round of our Open 
[00:52:00]  Anthony auction.  First round.  The first wave of items are now gone.  Yes.  And we raised $19,000 officially.  Get out of here, really?  The second phase is up and doing quite well.  Bid's already close to $20,000 for the second phase.  Wow.  This is going to be like a third and a fourth phase, pretty much for the whole month of September.  We're going to raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. 
[00:52:30]  100% of the proceeds.  Dan and I aren't getting anything out of this.  So there's a lot of great items to bid on.  We're not.  You can go to openathlete.com to find the link and look at what's up there for bidding.  Forbidding.  I want my stuff back then.  You got a lot of stuff.  You brought a lot of stuff in, huh?  Of course I did.  More shirts and stuff?  Shirts.  Anything cool?  I had some Dice stuff laying around.  I got a...  What was his album called?  Remember that album?  Oh, um, butts up, hands down. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, something like that.  What?  It's a face down, ass up shirt.  Face down, ass up.  Yeah, and it says, I'm over here now on the back.  We should bring in our big, ridiculous, black hooded sweatshirts that he bought us.  Oh, the Everlast shirts that he made us buy that day.  That I wore once because he insisted that we all buy extra, extra, extra larges.  Uh-huh.  I'm like, but Dice, I will never wear this.  No, no, you got to get the big ones. 
[00:53:30]  The large.  Yeah, and he made us put them on.  It was ridiculous.  He bought them.  He haggled with the person at the register.  The guy always thinks he's in some kind of market in India where you can haggle with these people.  He's on 57th Street in Manhattan, and he's trying to haggle.  Well, how about I give you a 30 bucks for all of them?  You're like, whatever the price is here.  What is this?  I believe that was five years ago.  Was it that long ago?  Remember, we were talking about the Mets-Yankees possible World Series right outside the Viacom 
[00:54:00]  building.  Yeah.  They were doing those interviews.  Wow.  Five years ago.  Wow.  So I'll try to find my sweatshirt because it's just sitting in a drawer somewhere.  And then, oh, wow.  Turn that around.  Is there anything on the back?  No?  That is one of the WNEW 102.7 little baseball jerseys.  And then a...  The official, when you're out and about doing business, the collared 102.7.  The collared NEW shirt. 
[00:54:30]  Did you ever wear that?  The little NEW on the corner.  Probably wore it around the house one day.  Yeah.  Yeah, one of those things.  Ugh.  Yeah.  Nice.  That's good stuff right there.  What else is going up for auction today?  Oh, look at that.  All the Golden Platinum Records came today?  That is a Platinum Record Aussie.  The ultimate sin.  Very nice.  From Lee Abrams.  Commemorating, what, a million copies sold?  Right from his office.  Cool.  And a Joan Jett one? 
[00:55:00]  Jesus, he went from the A-list to the L-list.  Jesus.  What, did someone spit on that one?  What's up top?  Looks like someone vomited on it.  Yeah, because that thing has been in a closet.  Couldn't he have wiped them down before he sent them?  Jesus.  What the hell?  That's like a boot print.  Did he, was that his doormat or something?  God.  Hey, Lee, could you just spray a little Windex on these before you sent them?  Please.  Jesus.  I love rock and roll. 
[00:55:30]  There you go.  All right.  Well, we'll throw that up there.  We should get at least $10 for those.  And I brought in a very, very, really insignificant item, but there's a few of them.  I have my original headshot.  Yes, I was laughing at these earlier when you showed me.  From 1992, a woman in Woodbridge, New Jersey took my headshot.  I was two years in the business.  Two years?  In the business, yeah.  Why did you choose that shot?  I don't know.  I know you must have had more that you had to choose from.  I'm sure the other ones were worse.  You look a little gruff in it. 
[00:56:00]  Rough and tumble.  Ooh.  You don't look fun.  You look threatening.  He looks like he's 15 years old.  Nah, he looks like one of those kids that'll cut you with a box cutter.  You think?  Yeah.  I was 22 or 23, and I had to get my headshot, so I got them.  I got more later, obviously.  Yeah.  Real awful ones I never used.  Well, now that you're going out to Hollywood to become a big star, this is a very valuable item.  You should use those.  Ugh.  Like, if you have a gig somewhere.  You know how people use their, like, headshots from years ago? 
[00:56:30]  Just use that one.  A little Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, over and over again.  All right, also, you've got to throw the Cal Ripken autographed baseball up there today.  It's time.  Big item.  Big, big.  It's time to get those big items up there, okay?  Big, big items.  Where's Chester?  Wow.  The XM MyFi with lifetime subscription is up to $1,500, Anthony.  Ooh.  Could you do the price thing so we could go to the top items right now?  Opie and Anthony interned for a day.  $2,400 right now, Ant, with six days left in that bid. 
[00:57:00]  In that auction, whatever.  The other interned for a day is up to $2,100.  Holy crap.  Robert Kelly's knee cast is in fourth place right now.  $1,400.  Wow.  It's catching so far.  That's a big one.  Brian Regan's Cup of Dirt in sixth place, getting $430 so far.  It's autographed, of course.  And the WNEW Inappropriate Bell?  That. 
[00:57:30]  Where?  They retook it.  I'm getting my stuff.  It's a valuable bell.  They had to take it, Anthony.  The Inappropriate Bell.  That's all right.  I'll do it myself.  The Inappropriate Bell.  I'll put all my stuff out here.  The bid for that is up to $430.  So go to OpieandAnthony.com.  It's for a great cause, obviously.  Find the link to the Opie and Anthony auction.  All my stuff.  God.  What a worthless collection of junk.  Just garbage.  I like sitting here with garbage to my left. 
[00:58:00]  It's kind of creepy every morning.  You know, Ant, like, lays out his instruments.  I am an artiste.  All this stuff.  You never know when he needs some of these things.  I am Zamphir, master of the pan flute.  He was playing Happy Birthday.  No, that was the Titanic.  You motherfucker. 
[00:58:30]  You know what we...  You just reminded me of something.  We didn't play the audio of Celine Dion and Larry King.  No, we didn't.  This was priceless.  She was very upset.  We all understand that it was a disaster down there.  But how could you not laugh when Celine Dion just breaks into song on Larry King?  Because that's going to help the victims.  That's what they need.  A song for Celine.  Ew, she sang.  Oh, my God.  This is really creepy.  It's deeply disturbing.  I understand everyone. 
[00:59:00]  Even we have been affected.  And we're trying to do our part.  But, God damn, man.  Some of these people have got to relax.  It's like Ben brought in the picture of Sean Penn walking around New Orleans with a shotgun.  A shotgun.  Here it is right here.  He's walking around with a shotgun, I guess, to protect himself as he goes on his rescue missions.  I don't know.  There's a lot of stories about the shotgun.  Supposedly he found it laying around and picked it up.  Oh, please.  Others say that he brought it himself. 
[00:59:30]  I was handing this to the police.  Right.  Shithead, you got caught.  It's okay for you to have a gun for protection, but nobody else, right?  Yeah.  His little scheme backfired.  You know, this guy brought his own photographer down there as he's rescuing people.  That's just no good.  I thought he was an asshole for many years, but it turns out he really is kind of just a weirdo.  Like, he's one of those real weird guys.  Be more like your brother.  He's fat and jolly and makes fun movies. 
[01:00:00]  He looks like an alcoholic.  What a mess he is.  That's how I'm going to say that word from now on.  Alcoholic.  Alcoholic.  Maybe I'll get him on the show.  We have the same manager.  I'll talk to my manager.  Stop it.  See if I get him.  And I have talked to Chris Penn in the past.  I've never met him.  Oh, we did.  We did.  Many years ago.  No, in person, too.  Oh.  I got a picture with Chris Penn.  I want one.  I should bring in all my old celebrity photos.  They're kind of funny.  You should.  Throw them up on the website there.  All right, here we go. 
[01:00:30]  So, Celine Dion, we've got to play this a little bit here.  Celine.  A little bit.  Celine Dion and Larry King last week.  I have to say, Larry, that I'm as devastated as the rest of the world.  Devastated?  If I may, I was watching you behind.  There's a television right now.  I'm watching and I'm especially waiting like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  Yeah, through your little pigeon neck.  She sounds like Christopher Walken.  Oh.  I could barely swallow it. 
[01:01:00]  I could barely.  I could barely swallow it.  And she's in one of those ridiculous suites in Las Vegas.  From my huge 38-inch plasma television, I could not take the pain and anguish of those people  as I looked down on Las Vegas from my penthouse suite.  Why couldn't you swallow the coffee?  Was her husband using her mouth to practice rolling Dyson?  Well, we've heard he's got a problem.  What can I tell you?  We all have problems. 
[01:01:30]  And I'm especially waiting like the rest of the world.  I'm waking up in the morning.  I'm having a coffee.  I barely can swallow it.  I come here at Caesars Palace every night to perform.  Uh-oh.  I barely can sing.  Yeah, well.  But for respect for the people who come, I am still singing.  When I come home at night, my son is waiting for me.  I watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollars. 
[01:02:00]  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world.  I open the television.  There's speed.  How do you open a television?  I open the television.  Opie, I don't think we should make fun of this.  She's still saying while those people suffered, she's brave.  She is brave.  She's a brave girl.  We gave a million dollar.  I have a coffee.  I don't know what plural is.  How about buying an S, you foreign whore? 
[01:02:30]  Watch television.  Yes, we gave a million dollar.  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world.  I open the television.  See, it was a dollar and she just wrote million on it.  Million dollar.  It was a million dollar.  And I open the television and I see wires and tubes.  And I don't know what year it is because there's never tubes in TVs anymore, you idiot.  I open television.  What?  But what we expect, what I want to look like the rest of the world. 
[01:03:00]  So I open the television, there's people still there waiting to be rescued.  And for me, it's not acceptable.  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude, but I don't want to hear those reasons.  You know, some people.  They should fly her over, fly her over like the flooded areas.  Yeah.  In a helicopter and lower her down and then she could sing the Titanic song.  Wouldn't that be great?  As they're hanging on to their roofs.  Hold on, Tyrone. 
[01:03:30]  Tyrone, don't let go.  Don't ever let go, Tyrone.  If only there was room enough for you on that door that your girlfriend is on right now.  It could be a huge cavernous door and there still wouldn't be room.  Have you seen the women down there?  Big fat asses.  You are a survivor.  Many people perished under the brown sewage of New Orleans. 
[01:04:00]  Much like they did that fateful night in April of 19...  18?  12?  14?  1912.  It was 12, shut up.  Sorry, sorry.  Much like they perished in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.  On that fateful maiden voyage of the Titanic.  But some of them were survivors. 
[01:04:30]  Where are you?  And Larry, I watch.  I watch and personally I don't care.  But I cry.  I cry because my husband is 90 fucking years old.  I cry when I think he touched me when I was 14. 
[01:05:00]  Forced me to marry him.  That is why I weep today.  You think I really care about the shwoogies, Larry?  How many bodies lie there beneath that mucky, brown, stinky mess?  I say pee you, Larry.  And some of them cling to their rooftops like many clung to life jackets and pieces of wood on that fateful night on the peak. 
[01:05:30]  They are truly, truly, truly Negroes.  They are so poor and so black.  All right, back to the audio.  Jesus.  That was fantastic.  Oh, stop it.  Back to Celine.  More crying Celine.  And for me, it's not acceptable. 
[01:06:00]  I know there's reasons for it.  I'm sorry to say I'm being rude, but I don't want to hear those reasons.  You know, some people are stealing and they're making a big deal out of it.  Oh, they're stealing 20 pair of jeans or they're stealing television sets.  Who cares?  They're not going to go too far with it.  Maybe those people are so poor, some of the people who do that, they're so poor, they've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  Invite them into your house. 
[01:06:30]  Let them touch.  You also have never touched a seat at your show at Caesars, you fucking overpriced Canadian hosebag.  But you never touched an orchestra seat there, did they?  Oh, my God.  Let them touch stuff.  Let them just touch it.  That's the biggest cocktease ever.  Here, here, feel this plasma TV that you'll never have.  What a racist she is.  Holy shit.  Just touch it.  Just touch it, because that'll make you feel better.  Unfortunately, they were touching guns at Walmart and touching the triggers. 
[01:07:00]  Stop it.  I was inspired when they taught Coco to sign.  Oh, she did not say let the people touch.  Just touch it.  Just touch it.  Oh, my goodness.  The people who do that, they're so poor.  They've never touched anything in their lives.  Let them touch those things for once.  The main thing right now, it's not the people who are stealing.  It's the people who are left there, and they're watching helicopters flying over their heads. 
[01:07:30]  Helicopters.  And they're praying.  How come it's so easy to send planes in another country to kill everyone in a second to destroy lives?  We need to serve our country.  And for me to serve our country is to be there right now to rescue the rest of the people.  We need the cash.  We need the blood.  We need the support.  Right now, we need the prayers.  Jesus, where's Larry through that whole nightmare?  Jesus, I was nodding off. 
[01:08:00]  She is the foreign policy inside of a six-year-old.  Why do we send bombs to blow up their world and the universe?  In seconds.  In seconds.  Everything.  I can't get over the fact let them touch things.  Just touch it.  Much like the poor passengers that were stuck in steerage on the Titanic, we should just pull gates shut and lock them to drown in their basements.  Look, Tyrone, you'll never have an iPod, but hey, feel free to touch it.  I want to touch it. 
[01:08:30]  Right.  Oh.  Oh, is that the best?  What a mess she is.  She continued on Larry King last week.  It is, you know, when I was hearing a couple of days ago that these things are not reachable, it's too full of water, maybe I'm too much like my, I'm not thinking with my head, I'm talking with my heart.  Nobody can open any roofs.  The helicopter is flying in.  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls. 
[01:09:00]  Take a kayak.  A kayak.  Oh, she's an outdoorsy one.  Or take a limo like I do to go to my shoes.  Why can't they take the flying Steve car and please pick up these people?  Take a kayak.  Oh, it is so easy if Steve would just, there he is now.  Just fly by Steve.  Land and pick these people up in your flying hybrid car. 
[01:09:30]  The helicopter is flying in.  Take two people at a time.  Take a kayak.  Go into those walls.  What?  There's.  What?  You can't take a kayak through walls.  Take a kayak through those walls?  What does she say?  She watches Gilligan's Island too much.  You think that's how they get around?  A kayak.  Jesus, this isn't I Dream of Jeannie.  Is Jim leaving a permanent thing? 
[01:10:00]  No.  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  A big part of the show and he'll be coming back and forth and doing this and doing that.  Don't you worry.  There's kids being raped at night.  We hear gunshots.  Big guns.  What's that?  Those people are playing.  They're walking.  They're like this.  Hello?  Do you see us?  We're still alive.  But we're dying.  It's terrible.  I do not want to talk to you about money.  What?  Holy crap. 
[01:10:30]  Will you just shut up and sing your stupid song?  She lost her fucking mind and it's fantastic.  We can't see them at night because they're dark until they smile.  We see teeth.  We think they're floating dentures.  But there are people attached to those.  Oh, is she an ass?  I thought somebody dropped a big package of ping pong balls.  And I was looking.  But it was humans looking up at me.  I thought it was ping pong balls and chiclets. 
[01:11:00]  But it wasn't, Larry.  It was people.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Let's say hi to Carl in New Jersey.  Carl?  Hey, she sounds like Mr. Wet.  Do you remember Mr. Wet?  Mr. Wet.  Yeah, there was two radio DJs.  They had a show back in the day.  I forget their names.  It was a good fact.  You and Anthony referenced him all the time once in a while back in the day.  And he was a Mr. Wet. 
[01:11:30]  I'm from the sewer.  I live under the ground.  I'm Mr. Wet.  Never, ever, ever.  This guy is amazing.  I could have saved.  I'm sorry, Carl.  I really don't know what you're talking about.  All right.  Let's continue.  Why are you taking the birthday cake out?  Huh?  Move it over there.  Oh, okay.  All right.  More of Celine Dion.  Of course.  Please.  I want this burnt so I could listen to it on the way home.  Of course.  We're going to have Maury Povich in studio in a few minutes as well. 
[01:12:00]  So stay there.  Maury.  But first, Maury's going to have to wait a few minutes.  We've been doing the show now for two and a half hours.  We've been asking a lot of people how they can help, how you can help a lot of people all  over the world want to help.  You gave a million dollars.  You're going to help a lot of people live and survive.  You should take great pride in that.  One, that you've attained the ability to be able to do that, to be able to give a million  dollars.  You should take pride in that.  I understand it. 
[01:12:30]  I understand it's very important because eventually we will need that money.  But it's just very frustrating that Franco and Consciousness and me, oh, they're one million  dollar.  If this is one thing, in three months, in six months, they will need that money.  Right now, they're praying for water.  So we need to send them the water.  They don't care about my check.  No, they do.  It's just frustrating because on our part of the world, we're trying our death and we're  expecting those people.  Oh, she don't shut up. 
[01:13:00]  I'm sorry.  Your check will turn into something.  And I'm sending Welch's grape juice and garlic.  Doddering old buffoon.  Yeah, you know, I love Larry King's style where he pretty much doesn't do anything on  his show and lets the people talk.  But sometimes, as a host, you've got to jump in there a little bit.  My God, is she upset?  Shut up.  All right, here's the clip of clips.  I know you've got to go on soon, but we couldn't spend any time with you without asking you, 
[01:13:30]  do you have any kind of thing you would like to sing that fits this moment?  And she's got a song for everything.  Thanks, Larry.  She's got a song for everything.  Is there any song in your...  Even if you did a little of it, I don't want to...  Well, the only song that comes to my mind right now is definitely a prayer.  What's going on in Larry King's mind? 
[01:14:00]  Do you think he knows she's just a lunatic at this point and is exploiting that?  Yeah.  Or is he dead serious about having Celine Dion sing a song for everybody?  I think he's just trying to get as much out of her as he can, and at this point, having  her do a song is the icing.  You think so?  Is he being that calculating, or is he just an out-of-touch ass?  That's what I'm wondering, you know?  Sing a song.  The Motley Crue.  Because she's not in the right frame of mind to actually sing a song.  Let's see how this plays out. 
[01:14:30]  It's definitely a prayer.  I did sing that song a few years back with Andrea Bocelli.  Oh, yes.  And I cannot think about a song without a prayer.  I will do my very best, and I'll do my best.  Generals gather in their masses.  I pray you'll be all right.  Let's just end, Bruce Kelly's crying. 
[01:15:00]  And help us to be wise in times when we don't know.  Let this be our prayer.  When we lose our way, lead us to a place.  Guide us with your grace. 
[01:15:30]  Liar, whore, liar, whore, and you know it.  We'll be a place where we'll be safe.  Shut your goddamn pie hole.  I pray we'll find your life.  You can get a doggie star, you can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house, and I get the same.  When stars go out each night.  And I am so glad you are. 
[01:16:00]  Let this be our prayer.  Tanty talk.  Tanty talk, Ruff, whore.  Help us find a place.  Guide us with your grace.  Now choke yourself.  Give us faith so we'll be safe.  Well, no shit. 
[01:16:30]  Okay, terrific.  And there you have it.  That's very dramatic.  Wow.  Celine Dion.  There he came last week.  Wow.  Liar, whore, liar, whore.  Wow, she lost her mind.  That's fantastic.  Well, Shelly and Oneonta have something to say.  Shelly.  Hey, dudes, I like you guys a lot.  But, I mean, come on.  She fucking gave a million dollars.  She's totally a wreck because she saw the same pictures we all saw. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  And fucking English is her second language.  So she says, you know, let them touch things.  I don't think she's, you know, means let them touch things.  Leonora literal.  Well, come on.  What do you think she meant by that?  Yeah.  I'm an editor, and I edited a show about her many years ago.  Ah.  Her English is just not very good.  Can you say this?  Can you just say, oh, guys, we're all going to get in trouble? 
[01:17:30]  What do you mean?  You know, letting people touch stuff that they'll never have in their lives, that's a little strange.  I'm sorry to say.  That's someone that is completely out of touch with the common person.  No, she thinks she's like one of 14 kids.  She's from a poor family.  Yes, I was very poor.  She's now out of touch.  When was the last time she had to worry about paying a bill?  I was watching those poor people, and I'm absolutely crying over here. 
[01:18:00]  Maury Povich is loving this.  I'm crying, though.  Let's get him in here.  Yeah, where's Maury?  All right.  All right.  We don't have time for you, Shelly.  We have Maury Povich coming in.  Oh, my God.  I went and saw a Maury Povich show once.  You did?  Well, hold on.  Hold on.  Shelly from Oney Island.  Maury Povich.  One of my all-time favorites, Maury Povich.  Oh, Anthony.  I love the show.  You're back.  Jimmy is here.  You've got everybody here except Paul and Denise. 
[01:18:30]  Where are they?  The gang's all here.  Yeah, right?  I'm running down the highway from Baltimore to New York the other day, and I'm hearing the  worst of Opie and Anthony.  And I'm hearing about Paul and Denise.  Yeah, they're going.  You want them on a Maury show?  We can set that up.  They qualify.  They would fit perfectly, man.  You know, we should get a little partnership going.  Now, which one can we do?  On the cheating show?  Although she says she's absolutely devoted to this one, right?  I think it's things maybe that you've done when you're drunk that you regret and your 
[01:19:00]  husband now has to live with.  What subject would that cover?  Because to fill everyone in, she went to the bathroom at some event, was pinned against  the wall by some celebrity, some soap star out there.  Oh, yeah.  Some British soap star.  Some British soap star.  Black gentleman.  Who she, yeah, yeah.  A black guy.  She drops to her knees and gives the guy head.  And the husband finds out about this, and I don't know, is he fine with it? 
[01:19:30]  He's got to be.  Yeah, he was fine with it.  Yeah, she came back down and joined the party.  People that should be killed, euthanized?  I don't know.  There's got to be a subject for Maury's show on that one.  Well, I mean, we've had people on.  In fact, today I'm taping a show in which a woman is trying to find out the father of  her baby.  Of course.  Of course.  I love those Maury's.  But the deal is that there was a party one night, and there were a lot of guys.  Oh, my God.  She had a gang back, as they call it.  So she's already brought on six of them at the party. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, my God.  Today she's bringing the seventh.  Seventh guy.  And her husband has forgiven her.  Wow.  I just can't believe this stuff.  Is she hot, Maury?  Yes, I remember.  She's okay.  Yeah?  I was wondering why the husband...  They're all okay.  Yeah.  Now, are they given DNA tests?  Of course.  And that's what it is?  Oh, yeah.  And I guess the first six have passed, or are you going to wait until you got them all 
[01:20:30]  and then give her the result?  Yeah, right.  I know.  I'll tell you, the problem is, I'm in a golf course the other day, and in the middle of  a putt, a friend of mine says, listen to this, he gives me the headline for my show.  He says, I had both the twins, and both of them are the father.  But I'm going, my God, I've never done that.  I've never had that one.  How the hell does that work?  How can you figure out which twin?  Right.  Wow.  Because both twins have the same DNA. 
[01:21:00]  And they have the same DNA, so you wouldn't be able to tell.  Wow.  That is really a predicament.  I'm waiting for that one.  Maury, you'll solve it.  Somehow you'll solve it.  You always do.  You're able to wrap shit up in an hour, and I love it.  Now, let me get this straight.  Celine Dion was talking about, let them touch?  Touch the plasma TVs.  Let them touch the pants and the sneakers.  Can someone find that so we can play that for a while?  Because they're poor, and they don't have those things, so they should at least be allowed 
[01:21:30]  to touch it.  Did they show Larry's reaction when she was saying that?  I think he was snoring at the time.  Poor old Larry.  Oh, now, now, now.  Don't mess with us old TV talk show tights.  You seem to have a little more spunk than Larry King.  A little more pep in your step there, Maury.  So, guys, how's XM?  It's great, huh?  Oh, we love it.  No more FCC.  I assume that there's not a suit that can call you anymore.  We're not even in Washington. 
[01:22:00]  Washington is where all the bosses of XM are, so they put us up here.  We don't even have a boss that tells us anything.  It's anarchy.  It's just a matter of time before we screw this up, Maury.  We leave right at 11 o'clock.  Boy, you've got to really do something bad to mess this up.  We've thought about that.  We've got some ideas.  Have you had sex in a church?  Call us.  What?  You're still doing well?  Everybody still loves you?  Yeah, the gang's all here.  We're rebuilding an audience every day, so we're having a lot of fun.  Isn't that great? 
[01:22:30]  Kind of like a startup?  It's kind of fun to start over again.  It was kind of getting a little annoying on regular radio with the FCC and the bosses.  Anything we came up, any new ideas we came up to do, they would strike down.  Here, anything goes.  I mean, it's kind of like they called me when Fox was going to do a current affair again.  Right, you were the host.  And I was saying, you can't do that.  You just can't do that.  Wasn't that show for the time that it was, the 80s?  Absolutely. 
[01:23:00]  We had it in the beginning.  We had it by ourselves.  And the only competition we had was Entertainment Tonight, and that was just in the celebrity area.  And they were too tame to come.  Yeah, you guys took it to the gutter.  I mean, you took it to the street level.  Oh, absolutely.  That's the only show doing it at the time.  Yeah.  And then Inside Edition came, and we knocked them down.  And then Hard Copy, then I left before Hard Copy.  So we only had really one.  In fact, the host of Inside Edition was Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:23:30]  That was who he was the host.  Yeah.  And we kind of competed against each other.  And you kicked his ass to Inchimori.  Absolutely.  You saw the gleam in my eyes.  Absolutely.  No.  So he's okay.  Anyway.  No, he's not.  But what happened was, see, Paramount is the smartest people in the world.  What happened was, I was going along okay, but I was thinking about doing a talk show.  Paramount, who owns Entertainment Tonight, says, we want to give you a talk show.  I said, oh, we think you're the greatest talk show host in the world. 
[01:24:00]  I said, well, I haven't done any talk nationwide yet.  I've only done it locally.  He says, no, we love that.  We love that.  Finds out later on, they just wanted me off of Current Affair.  That's all they wanted.  They didn't know what kind of a talk show host I was.  They just wanted me off the darn show that was beating them.  So they hire me to do a talk show, go off of Current Affair, then that kind of thing  goes down.  After a while, Maureen O'Boyle's there for a while, and then it kind of goes down.  Oh, I forgot about her.  Yeah.  We interviewed her back in the day.  She was a hottie.  What is she doing now? 
[01:24:30]  I think she's kind of retired up in New York State.  She has at least one child, I think.  Wow.  She was really nice to us.  Yeah, Maureen's good.  The new host they got?  Awful.  Tim Redden.  That show's a disaster.  I don't know him.  It's just in name, Current Affair.  I've met him.  It doesn't have the same vibe.  He seems like a nice guy, but he has nothing.  They're doing a lot of crime.  You see, they figured that that's the only area that those other shows, Extra and Access  Hollywood weren't doing, were crime.  So I think they jumped on a lot of crime stories.  You guys, I mean, at the time you were hosting, had things like, what, the Butterfuco thing? 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, but Affuco, Robert Chambers was the big one.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the preppy murder.  Oh, yeah.  And it was just a scandal.  Where we had the videotape of him tearing off the head of a doll at a slumber party.  Yeah.  That was the best.  Yeah, absolutely.  I remember that.  I think it was the greatest thing.  We only bought it for like 10 grand.  And at the time, like in 1987, everybody's going, you paid $10,000.  Meanwhile, about eight years later with Joey, they paid like a half a million dollars for him. 
[01:25:30]  That's incredible.  But none of the like legitimate news organizations would touch stuff like that or get that in  depth into the real like down and dirty of the.  Until, of course, we were successful.  Right.  And then all of television news changed.  And that kind of started the whole thing wrong.  And that was kind of like that predated like O.J. and the whole thing.  So then everybody there jumped on that because we had been popular with a lot of the. 
[01:26:00]  Whose idea was that then to come up with a show that's kind of.  Actually, the guy who's come back, a guy named Peter Brennan.  See, what happened was Rupert Murdoch.  I mean, I'm anchoring the news for him when he buys Fox in Washington at the big station  of Washington, Channel 5 in Washington, TTG.  And he buys the old Metro media stations and he wants to start this show called A Current  Affair, which had the same name in Australia.  So he brings me, who's anchoring a news to New York in 1986 as a summer experiment. 
[01:26:30]  And he says, well, we'll see if it works.  I said, but but I got your highest ratings of all your stations in Washington.  Well, we'll find out whether I said, wait a second, you try to tell me I'm coming to  summer camp up here.  Yeah, it doesn't work out.  I'm going back.  Oh, yeah, that's it.  And by the way, my I had just married my wife and and she was living in New York working for  NBC and I was in Washington.  So we were commuting.  So for the first time in our marriage, after a year and a half, we were going to live together 
[01:27:00]  here in New York.  And he says, we'll find out whether your marriage will work.  So I came here in 86 and have been held hostage ever since.  Wow.  And so he threw me together with these Aussies who had never been on American television,  had never done anything on American television.  So we had Peter Brannon, Ian Ray.  We had brought Gordon Elliott, that crazy big guy.  And Gordon was one of our reporters.  We had Steve Dunleavy, another Australian who works for the New York Post, but these wild, 
[01:27:30]  crazy guys and just sent everybody all over the country looking for these crazy stories.  We had like, you know, the X-rated sheriff in Kansas who was fired because he and his  wife were filming them or videotaping themselves, making love one day.  And he took the rental video camera back to the store.  I left the tape in the camera and it was all over town.  I remember that one.  The poor X-rated sheriff.  No one was getting stories like that.  It had a very British tabloid feel to it. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, absolutely.  You know, and no one was getting those stories.  That's great.  And, well, your show now.  Well, it's just wild.  I mean, I cannot get enough of it.  You slay me on a daily basis.  Maury, where do you find me?  We make fun of this all the time.  I want to be respectful.  Are you the radio version of South Park?  Did you ever see their spoof on me?  Oh, my God.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  Oh, did they nail you.  You know, all the disfigured kids, which you have on, which is very legit. 
[01:28:30]  They did the whole satire on me and the disfigured kids.  I don't know where you get some of these people.  Now, they're horrible combine accidents.  Oh, yeah.  Or are they birth defects?  Whatever they are.  They flock to you like the modern-day Jesus.  And you put them on.  Right.  And I see a bit.  I've got to call you out.  I see a little bit. 
[01:29:00]  Let's take a show where it's like, don't stare.  Right.  I'm just a person or I'm good.  What was the title of that show?  Yeah, don't stare.  I'm as good as you are.  Right.  I'm normal.  I'm a person.  And what you do, instead of having maybe a few hundred people at most look at them on  the street walking and staring every day, you have millions staring at them on television.  Now, it seems to defeat the purpose of the title, Mark.  I'm just trying to turn America's mindset around, you know. 
[01:29:30]  Is that it?  Humanize them a little.  Trying to show the public that these kids should be treated like everybody else.  So, when you see them on the street, now you've seen them humanized.  Right.  On TV.  And you won't be as mean or critical.  Exactly.  Well, then, God bless you, Maury Povich, because now I finally understand.  I thought, silly, stupid me, I thought people were tuning in like it was P.T. Barnum pulling  the curtain back.  Oh.  Oh, I hadn't thought about it that way. 
[01:30:00]  Because, let me tell you something, Maury.  Maury, when you put those little tiny children in your bookshelves.  Oh, the primordial dwarves.  Come on.  When you put the primordial dwarves.  That's still our favorite show ever.  And you had one hiding in your garbage can, Maury.  That's right.  I smelled a little exploitation.  There was one in my bookcase.  There was.  There was.  Where is she?  She's in my drawer.  They're the cutest things in the world.  I bet they are, Maury.  You wouldn't bring one home with you, though. 
[01:30:30]  We just taped one the other day.  Did you?  How do you find...  You know something?  I've been walking around this earth for quite some time.  I've never seen a lot of things.  I've never seen one of those.  Where do you find them?  What country?  They just seemed to find me.  He doesn't even want to say.  He's got a source.  Of course.  He's got a secret source.  It's like a hollow tree somewhere that only Maury knows.  Two people that are just drinking heavily all day having sex?  No.  What happens is you have one on.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden there's a family who calls and says,  I have one who's never seen anyone who looks like my child. 
[01:31:00]  I want my child to meet someone who has to go through what he does.  Right.  So we get them together.  And you got some set.  We unite them.  Because I see you hugging and kissing.  And it's very nice and all.  But a lot of people on this planet would go, yee, whoo, and not embrace.  Somehow it just works.  That's not the case.  It works.  I know.  It really does. 
[01:31:30]  And I've got to tell you, for how nasty and mean-spirited we are on this program,  sometimes we tune in and even we have to go, oh, my God.  I cannot believe, Anthony, that you would ever have that feeling.  I feel sad sometimes.  I look up and there's a girl crying.  Anthony, I didn't think there was that fiber in your body.  Neither did I.  Maury has brought it out.  I look and sometimes I well up a little bit and go, that's sweet.  That poor kid.  Probably never out in public at all.  And now Maury brings her out and gives her a kiss. 
[01:32:00]  And it's very sweet.  Maury, how did you survive?  There were a lot of shows like yours on TV.  True.  And they all went away except you.  Well, I think what happened was, I mean, we got younger, strangely enough.  First of all, you have to understand that the talk show audiences during the day, for the  most part, are older audiences.  They're stay-at-home.  Those audiences are scary.  Yeah.  And somehow we went, I mean, we're now, we have an average age under 40, which is unheard  of.  Most daytime audiences.  And I think it's the themes.  I mean, the paternity is just unbelievable. 
[01:32:30]  Well, that's a big one.  That's a big one.  If you aren't parading around something that should be on the set of masks, you are doing  the paternity test.  Well, the funniest thing was, you know, I have all my golf buddies, see?  So I have my golf buddies.  One golf buddy says to me, he says, you won't believe what happened.  I said, why?  He says, well, I went over to the caddy shack.  I like to hang around with the caddies.  And they're watching your show in the caddy room.  I said, yeah.  He says, this is what I hear. 
[01:33:00]  One caddy saying to the other, anybody back home ever accuse you of being the father of  their babies?  Oh, yeah.  They do?  What do you do?  He says, I tell them all the same thing.  He says, what do you tell them?  He says, I tell them I ain't the father till Maury tells me I'm the father.  I said, I've arrived.  Now, you get some really distraught women when that happens.  And I see them.  They run backstage.  Oh, yeah.  And the camera follows them.  And then here comes Maury to console them. 
[01:33:30]  But how about when they do it the fifth time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they brought back the fifth guy.  The fifth guy.  And you just want to say sometimes, you're a little slut.  If you want to push a button for a segment, all you have to do is she's accusing a guy  of being the father of her child.  And the guy has a new girlfriend.  Right.  And all you have to do is bring the new girlfriend.  Oh, yeah.  And the two women go nuts.  Now there's some money. 
[01:34:00]  And the guy is in the middle saying nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Yeah.  And the women take over and they claw each other.  Do you get more guys that are or aren't the father?  Have you noticed?  I'd say it's equal.  Equal?  Yeah.  I'd say it's about equal.  I've been surprised.  The key for me is I never know.  You don't until it's said.  I never, ever know.  How accurate have you been?  You've got to make a guess in your head.  I'm about as accurate as I am on the show that we do with the beauty pageants, Are You  a Man or a Woman? 
[01:34:30]  Oh, yeah.  Another great one.  I'm about as accurate as I am with them.  I have no clue.  Have you made those mistakes, too?  Oh, my God.  Jimmy's had a few mishaps over the years.  Usually around, what, one or two in the morning?  Yeah, maybe a couple of times.  Instead of your show, in your Saturn.  Last girl at the bar.  Oh, I know that.  Those are the shows you have to watch beginning to end.  And the teases are great.  It's like, and now Stephanie comes out here. 
[01:35:00]  Stephanie, we'll tell you after this.  And you've got to stick around.  And you know that the guys are better looking than the women.  There have been times that I have watched and been fooled, yeah.  And I pride myself on being able to pick them out.  And usually, one time, once during the show, they will have somebody who sings to me or  entertains me.  Of course.  And now they're rubbing up.  And I'm going, oh, what is going on?  I just...  Doing something on your thigh, Maury?  Yeah, yeah.  Jimmy, you want to tell Maury what happened to you? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, tell me, Jim.  I was lonely.  Doesn't surprise me.  Yeah, I was out.  Jimmy could easily be on many of your shows, by the way, Maury.  I was out one time, and I saw a pretty girl, and she got in the car, and she was doing things  for me.  In the car?  In the car.  Oh, you got to the car park?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got way beyond that.  We got into the, here's the money, and zip, and park.  She's doing stuff?  Oh, he didn't go to a bar, Maury.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, he was just down the street.  A street walker, yeah.  He drives around.  And I realized that she had a big back for a girl.  Because he's rubbing her back because of the way she's positioned to earn her key. 
[01:36:00]  And it was a tight, it was like a tight, almost like a suit shirt.  Like, you know, those tight, sweaty back, I could feel, and I just realized I was a guy.  You were in trouble.  Oh, jeez.  You were in trouble.  Yeah, I lost my rod.  It was fantastic up until that point, believe me.  Really, world time.  Well, it's better to recognize it then.  No, better to recognize it after you don't get your money back.  What, am I going to cue them a bait and switch?  I'll sue you for false advertising, fella. 
[01:36:30]  Come with a slash of the razor.  I just had to leave and go home and pretend it never happened.  We have to go backwards a little bit.  We got Paul on the line.  You heard Paul and Denise.  Yeah.  Oh, you're kidding.  We got Paul.  Is he there?  Hey, Paul.  Hey, what's up, boys?  You're on with Maury Povich.  I'm going to be your agent today.  I think we can get you on Maury's show.  Yeah, I heard.  I got like 10 emails.  Hey, Paul.  Yes.  How you doing, buddy?  I was in hysterics between exit 4 on the New Jersey Turnpike and exit 11 coming from Baltimore to New York. 
[01:37:00]  Holy shit.  Which story did you like?  Well, it was just the – I just – what I was trying to figure out the whole time is she is devoted to you as she says she is.  Yes, I am.  Oh, my Lord.  I am.  Wow.  Denise, you really are, huh?  Yes, I do.  I put up a lot with him.  Yeah, but there's a lot of flirtatious behavior going on there, Denise. 
[01:37:30]  Flirtatious?  No, no.  I'm flirtatious.  Huh?  I'm very open sexually, but when it comes to commitment, I'm very, very committed to him.  Well, how do we, you know, how do we define commitment here?  Yes, exactly.  A gun to a forehead, I'm thinking.  Exactly.  There's been a few, you know, a few things that have happened there.  Yeah, I mean, I heard these –  You want to know something?  I mean, nobody knows the complete details of everything.  Uh-oh.  Okay?  Oh, shit, there's more?  Yeah.  There's more. 
[01:38:00]  How many more Negroes are there?  That's not even funny.  Trust me.  I mean, if the world really knew what went behind the scenes and why I did some things that I did, you know what I mean?  No, not really.  Why she's done – oh, some things in your past, maybe?  Yeah, some things in my past with Paul.  Uh-oh.  Oh, oh.  Before that, don't talk about that now.  Yeah, see?  Well, Paul has one of the greatest stories ever told on our show.  Really?  Yeah, he had sex with a girl that was paralyzed. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that's true.  Huh?  What, Paul?  Oh, yeah.  I've got the funny part, too.  He had to pick her up and do, like, a fireman's carry from the wheelchair to the bed and then had sex with her, yeah.  Yeah, they used the same equipment.  They used to get those fat people out of the house in Brooklyn to get her up on the bed.  You're quite the catch there, Paul.  Hey, I can't say I ever did anything like that.  Well, you're on with –  I don't know I ever did walk.  Well, you guys are on with –  Holy fuck.  You guys are on with Maury Povich.  Yeah, I was – I was – I was engrossed. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  For seven exits on the Jersey turnpike.  I've gotten so many comments about our show since we've been on that day.  Has anybody else tried to rape you in the bathroom?  No, they say please now.  I've had offers.  From every black guy at every Opie and Anthony meeting.  And Paul is such a just blatant racist.  I don't know how this relationship works, but it does, Maury.  Do you see a connection?  My wife was raped by black people, and I hate the blacks. 
[01:39:30]  Do you see the connection?  Why do you hate the blacks?  Yeah.  I didn't get anything out of that during that show.  No, you don't get it during the show.  You get it when he's having lunch with you at a diner somewhere.  Then he just spouts off, and you're sitting there going,  Oh, my God, I can't sit with this guy.  Yeah, that's actually true.  My best friend at work is black.  I try all my material out on him.  He's the worst.  No, I'm an equal opportunity racist.  If you want to joke about the British, I'll join in and joke with you.  I don't give a shit.  We were sitting there playing cards down in Atlantic City, and I was hoping I wasn't going 
[01:40:00]  to get a flush because it was a spade flush, and I didn't want to hear him go off about  it.  I was like, I'll lose the pot.  I don't care.  Please, make it a mark.  He is.  He is so embarrassing.  The way he is on the show, the way he is out, I mean, that's him.  Yeah, we know that.  He's too loud.  Yeah, Andy, actually, I have a suggestion for a new Photoshop for you.  I'm thinking a cross between Pulp Fiction and New Orleans, the Welcome to New Orleans  sign, and underneath Dead Niggas.  Oh, all right.  Paul.  Thank you, Paul.  He never knows where to leave it alone. 
[01:40:30]  He's no filter, Paul.  Let's say hi to Sports Girl from Wack Bag.  Sports Girl.  Hey there.  I just have to say, this is like the best hour of radio I've ever heard.  Maury, you are a genius.  A genius.  Thank you.  Maury is the best.  The best is the baby daddy stories where he brings the girl back for the third and fourth  time.  Oh, yeah.  He's a sick guy.  Yeah, I think my record is 12.  Twelve.  One time, one time I said to a woman, I said, you know, I don't know much about the female 
[01:41:00]  reproductive situation here, but aren't we talking about a two-day period?  Right.  Isn't about, you know, that period of being able to get pregnant is about two days, and  we can't figure out who you were with after 12?  In a two-day period.  In a two-day period?  Wow.  That's barely leaving time to eat.  It really is.  All right, Sports Girl.  You ever do a show tonight?  We'll bring somebody on, and afterwards you're like, oh, Jesus, I really wish I hadn't done 
[01:41:30]  that one.  No.  I love the honesty, man.  There's probably a shower in his office.  It takes care of everything.  Yes, wash it off, Maury.  What happens to these people after the taping's over?  Well, a lot of them.  No, but I'll tell you, one of the good things that our audience is like, we update all these  stories.  Yeah, I know.  We update the cheating stories, you know, when they run off, and a guy's slept with  over 100 women.  I'll never take him back.  And six months later, they're back.  Back again. 
[01:42:00]  They're still together.  Yeah.  You know what some of my favorites are?  They're also the big, fat babies when Maury brings out the 100-pound three-year-old.  Three-year-old.  Right.  But the buffet table, that's just out of the age.  Now, it's not just bringing the kids.  You're the worst, Maury.  There's food on the set.  Well.  And they let the kid, like, dig his hands into cake.  I debated about that.  And he's only wearing a diaper when he walks out.  I debated about that.  You did.  So, what happened was, to soothe my conscience, I asked the mother, so, is this what he has 
[01:42:30]  at home?  Right.  And she says, oh, yeah.  I said, okay.  All right.  We're not doing anything different than she does at home.  And yet, instead of just dressing the kid, they put him in, like, a loincloth, just like  a little diaper, so you can see every fold.  That's a bit much.  In their little skin.  I talked to my producers about that.  You have, huh?  And then I went to the mother, and the mother said, that's what they wear at home.  Now, I've seen you make attempts to try to get the kid some medical help. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  We did that.  And see that.  But then, on the update shows, they come back, and they're bigger.  Yeah, I know.  What happens to the help?  Bad doctors.  I don't know.  Yeah, what kind of doctors are you getting, Maury?  Get them off of the back of matchbooks.  That's where they get their diplomas.  Be a doctor.  Stalker Patty has something.  Stalker Patty.  Hi.  I got a new show idea.  What's that?  I'm over 40 and still a virgin.  Now, that's topical because it's in the movies now, 40-year-old virgin. 
[01:43:30]  Patty is 50 years old.  Yeah.  And she is a virgin.  She's a virgin.  Not technically.  She is literally a virgin.  How close did she?  She's had Ron Jeremy's hand down her pants.  She's had her hand down Ron Jeremy's pants.  She's had her breasts felt by Jimmy Norton.  That was the first one ever touching.  She's been naked with a Krusty the Clown mask on in this studio.  But as far as sexual intercourse, she is a virgin.  And she's never done oral or any of that stuff. 
[01:44:00]  She is really...  Was this because there's no desire or...  No, she wants to.  She was brought up with a...  Waiting for the...  She was adopted by the strict Catholic family.  Waiting for her Prince Charming.  Prince Charming.  Stop.  You're 50.  Yeah.  She's a foundling.  Yeah.  She was dropped off as an infant in a diner by her mother.  Do you think there would be more...  Is this a single guest show or do you think they're more like you?  I don't know.  I think it's a great show. 
[01:44:30]  Maybe you'll lose their virginity show.  You can hook her up with another older virgin.  A 40-year-old virgin is a great idea.  Yeah.  She's 50 and she wants to fall in love with some guy.  And she says she's saving herself.  Or you could put her on the show,  My teeth look like mini chicklets, but I'm a human being.  Hey, for 50 years old, I'm a knockout  when you compare me to other women my age.  That is true.  She's got a nice...  I don't know.  I don't know. 
[01:45:00]  You should lose your virginity on Maury's show.  He can get the offensive line from the Giants and say,  Pick one.  Maury, would you do a show on virgin?  I like your imagery, Jim.  Yeah.  Like you're thinking.  I think you should do a show on virgins.  That's not a bad idea, guys.  I will take that back to the office this morning.  There you go.  And if you need Stalker Patty, give us a call.  We'll give you Stalker Patty.  Okay.  And of course, Maury, the progeria kids.  Oh, yeah.  The progeria kids.  When you bring them out with their little Yankee hats on. 
[01:45:30]  Come on now.  Just adorable.  Aren't they the cutest little...  I always comment about how adorable they are.  Somebody gains five years of age in a month.  You don't like that?  I think they're the cutest little things that ever walked off a UFO.  Oh, it's...  Anthony.  Sorry, Maury.  Now, come on, Anthony.  Okay, I apologize, Maury.  These are kids who have...  You know, they're not going to live that long.  I know.  Easy.  I hear them on the shelf.  You have to give them a skateboard.  Well, Maury, I'm an ordinary kid inside, and I like to skateboard, and... 
[01:46:00]  It's wonderful.  They're cute little voices.  Doot, doot, doot.  I think I stayed five minutes too long.  Oh, no.  Maury, come on.  No, I understand.  We're trying to see where your line is.  I feel...  You know something?  I've never been more educated about people and certain afflictions like that than I have  from your children.  You would have never known about it, would you?  Never would have known about it.  And there are times, I'm honest, that I do watch and go, oh, I can't even goof on that.  But Maury's right there giving support. 
[01:46:30]  There you go.  And he looks at his watch and...  All right, Maury.  All right, we're talking about the South Park thing.  So the South Park satire, and they did all of that.  And they just jumped on me so bad.  And so I called them afterwards, and they wouldn't answer the phone.  Are you kidding?  They wouldn't.  They were scared.  They thought, of course.  You're going to sue them or something or something like that.  So finally, I finally got somebody to answer the phone.  And I said, this is Maury Povich.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Maury, yeah, yeah.  Wait, is it okay?  I said, look, all I want to know is, how can I buy those original cartoon cells that appeared 
[01:47:00]  on the show?  And I've got five of them now in my office.  Hey, that's pretty cool.  The truth of the matter is, I see it as...  Oh, I'll tell you what.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  I'll find a cell.  Oh, my God.  I'll give it to you.  You put it on your auction.  And we auction it?  That's right.  He listens to our show.  That would be huge.  That'd be huge.  Yeah, I'll find one.  We're actually doing a good thing, the opening after the auction for the victims of parking  Katrina.  Yeah, I'll send one over.  You'll have an original cartoon cell from the South Park. 
[01:47:30]  That's huge.  Classic.  Yeah.  You've got to sign it.  Half hour of me.  I'm going to bid on that.  I want that.  Yeah, I'll bid on that.  We're all going to bid on it, Maury.  I'll send it over today.  Yeah, absolutely.  You've got to autograph it.  Now, can I get out of here?  Yes, Maury.  All right.  What do you got?  You can't have girls coming in with Maury's tears.  He's a married man.  They're not going to strip, Maury, are they?  No, no, Maury, we wouldn't do that to you.  No, we don't want to get Maury in trouble.  And as I see it, Maury has got a great sense of humor about a lot of things and stuff,  but he honestly does give a shit about the people that are on his show. 
[01:48:00]  And I do respect that.  Well, we can find the topics for your show, I'm telling you.  No, I'm telling you, I'm taking The Virgin Show.  I love The Virgin.  Yeah, that is a good one.  We're really good at this type of thing.  I'll give you full credit.  Patty's pretty good.  She'd work out fine on that program.  Patty, yeah, she's done a little TV, too.  She's become a star in her own right.  It's a little nuts.  Something tells me that girl isn't a real nurse.  You've got nurses out there?  There's a girl in a nurse uniform.  Oh, what if it's a nurse uniform?  Oh, I see.  Maury, before you leave, let me explain.  Jim Norton, he's been with us, and he'll continue to be with us, 
[01:48:30]  but he's flying out to L.A. to film a HBO series.  Really?  Yeah.  Shooting an HBO series.  So he leaves tomorrow.  Like a comedy series?  It's the first live audience sitcom they've done.  We start shooting, I think it's Monday, we do the first table read,  so I've got to go out tomorrow.  Well, this is big.  Yeah, hopefully.  Yeah, it's big for Jimmy.  It's big for the show, too, because we're going to follow his progress.  This is like a Def Jam or something else?  No, no, it's actually a sitcom.  Oh, it's a sitcom?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A guy named Louis C.K., it's his show, and I'm like one of the characters on the show.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I watch everything they have. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, they're great.  They usually make great brothers.  By the way, talking about that stuff, have you guys watched Barbershop?  Uh-uh.  Very good.  Showtime.  Yeah?  Very good.  You watch all the original programs?  I've watched that.  I'm watching Rome.  Rome is great.  I'm Entourage.  Entourage.  I'm an Entourage guy.  Very good.  Rescue me, I'm watching.  The guy must be as thin as a stick.  The main actor?  The movie star, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, he's like a head on a stick.  I love that show, Entourage.  Entourage is good.  And I'm going to start watching Weeds, because everyone's starting to talk about that show. 
[01:49:30]  Weeds is good.  Yeah.  She's good, Mary Louise Parker.  Right on.  I like all that stuff.  See, now.  Did you see the Lisa Kudrow show?  Oh, yeah.  Come back.  How uncomfortable is she on that show?  It's hysterical.  It's really good.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  It's like the sitcom queen comes back to do a show.  It's Lisa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very good.  You know, it really, it's saying a lot about network television.  A lot of people are going over to cable and watching these series, because they're more  real life.  They're more honest in their language and the topics they can cover. 
[01:50:00]  And they're all now bulked up between 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock.  Yeah.  And I'm TiVo and everything.  I mean, if you don't have a TiVo or DVR with your cable, you're sunk, because there's  so many things on.  We have things that record, and we're watching something, and all of a sudden, it'll bing,  come up and go, something's going to start recording.  So now you can't watch what you were watching.  You've got to start doing it.  I've got that one that's built in, probably like you in the Time Warner box.  You have to start doing it on the DVR.  And you can do two, but you've got to be watching one.  You can't watch a third and tape two. 
[01:50:30]  You do programming triage in your house.  You're like, what's more important?  This show's got to die.  You know?  Good line.  Pain in the ass.  Good line, Anthony.  Five of those things.  That's right.  Cable triage.  I'm sorry.  That show didn't make it.  I've got to make a choice.  Maury, you've got to come back.  Maury, always, always a pleasure to have you on, man.  I think we just met Maury for the first time, just before we blew ourselves up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can have a nice relationship here.  Good.  We'll promote your show later.  Absolutely.  I'll come back.  So, the new season, we're... 
[01:51:00]  Oh, we're starting this week.  It's already happening, right?  It's starting this week.  It's fine.  Right.  I mean, we're doing everything.  And everybody says, everybody said to me, well, how come you don't get the credit and  attention that you should deserve if you're the third rated talk show in the country?  I said, well, I said, all those people think that they're highbrow and we're lowbrow.  I said, but I look on cable television, see all those news channels, see everybody screaming  and yelling, except for hurricanes.  I said, I think my brows are about as high as they are. 
[01:51:30]  Who's ahead of you?  Who's the only two ahead of you?  Probably Oprah.  Dr. Phil.  Jesus.  That Dr. Phil.  What the hell happened there?  Oprah brings him on as a guest.  All of a sudden, anything...  And I don't think they like each other anymore.  No.  I think she owns him in terms of ownership.  Oh, yeah.  I can't stand Dr. Phil.  She's making some cake off of that.  I don't watch it.  I can't watch Dr. Phil.  Oprah, I'll take a peek every once in a while.  She does a good job.  I will.  I'll take a peek.  You put your skirt on and watch a little Oprah?  I said, I'll take a peek.  You like her?  I'm like sitting there every afternoon with tea.  Book of the Month Club? 
[01:52:00]  Do you remember that too?  What does Oprah recommend this month?  I said, I'll take a peek.  That's all.  In between curling up with a Judy Blume novel?  You should watch Oprah.  But Dr. Phil gives no advice, really.  All right, Oprah.  What?  Bye, guys.  No, Maury.  Gone.  Maury.  I got to go.  I got to take.  He's got to take a show.  Paternity updates.  I got paternity updates.  Hey, if I send a picture of us to your office, will you sign it for me?  Sure.  Send a picture of us from last time.  Oh, absolutely.  All right, thanks. 
[01:52:30]  Maury, thanks so much, man.  I want to see it.  I want it to be so good, I can TiVo it.  Well, what you can see, he did an HBO half-hour comedy special.  It's going to be October 21st on HBO.  Yeah, there you go.  You're big, Jim.  I'm a nobody, but I'm hopefully by the end of October to be moving along.  He's becoming bigger by the day, Maury.  He's becoming huge right in front of our eyes.  So there you have it.  Okay, guys.  Bring in the nurses.  All right.  Maury Povich, everyone.  Thank you.  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, you know, I'm starting to get hot.  Oh, no, I'm going to give up my virginity.  I'm a sport.  Maybe take a little cock right into my mouth.  It must hurt.  Maybe take it in the rear.  Maybe bang me up the ass.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  Hey, hey, hey.  She's a freak.  What do you want me to do? 
[01:53:30]  Uh, I'm not going to be facing the wall.  What do you want me to do?  I've always wanted a juicy cock.  Put it between the boobs.  I'm into the TF thing.  Put it between the boobs.  Put it in the pits.  Put it in the pits.  My favorite oral treat.  My favorite eating cock.  I'm hungry for a big, fat, juicy cock.  That's all right.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Whack your bag.  Shoot your big wad of cum right into my mouth. 
[01:54:00]  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me.  Oh, God.  After I suck you off, I want you to bang me up the ass.  I'm hungry for a hard-nailed cock.  Stick your huge cock in my tight ass.  That's scaring me.  I take it in the rear.  I'm a freak. 
[01:54:30]  That's what I was taught.  I got a big, juicy cock from Ben the other day.  Oh.  I like the banana fish.  I like the banana fish.  Oh, God.  I like the banana fish.  I'm a freak.  I enjoy having sex with a guy.  I enjoy something in my mouth.  I enjoy cock.  Between the boobs.  I enjoy cock in my tight ass.  That's what they call me.  She's a freak.  That's what they call me. 
[01:55:00]  She's a freak.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program.  Having a lot of fun today.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy's last day on the program for, you know, a couple weeks or so.  Damn it. 
[01:55:30]  But he'll be calling in.  Don't you worry.  Don't you worry.  Selfishly, I'm just not giving up this gig.  It's not happening.  It'll be A-OK.  We got a couple ladies outside the studio that are going to come in.  I think they're ladies.  I have no idea what's going on out there.  What do they do?  I don't know.  We'll get to them in a few minutes.  We're kind of celebrating Jim's last day for a while today and his birthday at the same time.  They're pulling out breasts and licking them.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Look at the nurse.  Is she really a nurse?  I don't know.  Hey, Jeff.  How are you doing, guys?  Pretty good.  We're looking at a lady outside the studio that might be a nurse.  We're not really sure.  Might be a nurse.  Might be a man.  Well, I don't know what's going on, but she, he, it has a nurse outfit on.  Oh, she's lovely.  I've been to many hospitals over the years, and I have never seen a nurse look like that.  No.  Every nurse I ever had kind of looks like Steve with a beard and might murder me.  It's like one of those homoerotic male nurses winds up killing 40 elderly people with a needle. 
[01:56:30]  You're saying this one breaks the mold, or what along those lines?  We don't know.  We're going to find out, Jeff.  Yeah.  Jeff Halpern, right, from the Washington Capitals.  Did I say your last name?  I always screw up.  What's that?  Did I say your last name right, sir?  Yeah, I think I pronounce it four different ways, too.  So, whatever you guys come up with.  Well, of course, you play for the Washington Capitals, and hockey is back, sir. 
[01:57:00]  You guys are big Islanders fans, huh?  I'm a huge Islanders fan.  Oh, he is.  Yes.  I love my Islanders.  I've loved them for many, many years.  But I've got to tell you, I was a little bitter when you guys went on strike.  A little bitter.  As a fan.  We're supposed to say it was a lockout.  Right, it was a lockout, not a strike.  It was a lockout.  Okay, you're clear.  No, I think that was an unnecessary year off, looking back on it.  And, you know, just like a lot of people say, I'm like, you know what?  I'm never going to a hockey game again. 
[01:57:30]  Liar, liar.  Because I've been going to games ever since I was, who knows, eight years old or something.  I've been following the Islanders all through the Stanley Cup years and all that.  And then I start reading a little bit about what's going on, and I'm reading about the rule changes,  and I'm starting to think, hmm, all right, I guess I could go to ten games this year.  I'm usually a season ticket holder, sir.  I think there were people saying that before the lockout.  So I think the game itself needed a little bit of a change and a little bit of, you know, 
[01:58:00]  some rule differences and just something to open the game up, make it a little more exciting.  And I don't think it needed to have a year off.  But at the same time, hopefully it comes back with a fresh start.  And there's going to be a lot of people not, you know, with football being so big and baseball season and the playoffs,  the NHL has to have to work pretty hard to gain a lot of those fans back.  You know what it seemed like when baseball went on strike?  It was kind of, I mean, I know it's a different thing, but they still took time off.  It was hard for them to come back.  They lost a lot of fans.  Then it seemed like McGuire, Sosa, that whole race really got a lot of people interested. 
[01:58:30]  Now, when you make a relative comparison, because a friend of mine is a big hockey fan,  do you think that what's going to happen in hockey is going to be like any type of a thing that kind of happened  with like some sort of a fan interest thing?  Or is it probably going to not, like, you know, have to kind of go down a different route?  Yeah.  Well, you know, with baseball, that was, you know, once in a hundred years,  you had Cal Ripken breaking the Ironman streak and McGuire and Sosa.  I mean, that was unbelievable, the timing of that. 
[01:59:00]  You'd like to think that at least there's some new young superstars in the league  that are going to take over, and it's Sidney Crosby or down here, and Alex Ovechkin.  But to be able to break Gretzky's records or Lemieux's records, you know, you can't really expect that.  You just kind of, I would think you'd have to hope that the game itself, you know,  takes care of some things and maybe there's a few more fights and goals  and a little more excitement for the fans to bring them back.  Well, what got me back into it immediately, I'm a pussy in the end, 
[01:59:30]  I'll probably get a full season with the Islanders there, of course you will.  Was all the rule changes, they got rid of that stupid red line thing, the two-line pass, I mean.  That was ridiculous.  That was slowing down the game for many years because you guys got a lot faster  and you could handle that crap.  Wow, damn it.  I think some of that stuff is, you know, it's all the stuff that's working on.  They can throw out, you know, in New York, like the Ice Girls and all the bells and whistles around,  but it's got to be the game on the ice at the end of the day that's going to be the reason why fans are coming. 
[02:00:00]  So hopefully they've worked a few of those things out.  Yeah, by the way, the rest of the league stole the idea of the Ice Girls from the Islanders.  Let's not forget that.  Have you ever seen a Carolina Hurricanes game?  No, I have not.  They hired about six of the local strippers down there to put cowboy hats on and be cheerleaders down there.  It's right out of the replacement.  The Islanders are the first ones to do it, but I think teams have perfected the idea.  Ran with the ball. 
[02:00:30]  I don't think my buddy Anthony has been to a hockey game.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  Well, remember the old days, there'd be a break in the action,  and the old teamster guy would come on the ice with a shovel and a pail,  and he'd be all sliding all over the place.  Oh, that old gag.  And he would have to, like, scoop up some of the ice shavings around the net and around the sides and stuff.  Well, the Islanders got hot chicks, barely 18, in tiny little outfits that come.  Yeah, they're not even 18.  He's right.  And they would come flying out on the ice and then spinning around and stuff, 
[02:01:00]  and eventually they would bend all the way over with their little shovels,  actually their big shovels that they could barely carry,  and do the same job that old-time teamster was doing.  Fantastic.  And, man, it brought a lot of excitement back in time.  Sounds great.  Yeah.  What are some of the other rule changes, Jeff?  I think they can, I mean, the goalie pads have gotten a little bit small.  It used to be, you know, you'd have good plays or good shots on that,  and these guys would just sit in there like that. 
[02:01:30]  You know, have you ever seen that commercial with the Russian goaltender that's so big  and just sits in there and pucks it?  Yeah, yeah.  They've gotten a little bit, so a little bit, so the goalies might actually have to move now.  Right.  Or you can, or if you do have a good play, you'll be rewarded with a goal,  and I think fans get the most excited for goals and the hits and stuff like that.  I think that'll change.  They've done a few things so the goalies can't come out of the net  and kind of slow things down like they have in the past,  keep them restricted to a certain area.  Yeah, where they don't go behind the net with the puck and fuck around with it. 
[02:02:00]  Do you think you'll see a high-scoring game?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I definitely think so.  I think...  How many times did I leave the Coliseum?  A 1-0 game, a 2-1 game.  Are there any truth to the rumors?  Because I've heard a friend of mine was telling me that they're actually thinking now,  like for the same, like baseball would make, they say juice the balls.  Is there any truth to the rumors that the hockey nest,  they're actually thinking of making 11 feet wide?  I don't know about 11 feet.  I think right now it's 6 feet wide,  but they tinkered around with making different goals and making it bigger. 
[02:02:30]  And certain things like that.  At the end of the day, I think the traditionalists won.  And the goals are the same.  The pads will be a little bit smaller, and I think that'll be a difference.  And you brought up more fighting earlier in the interview here.  Why will there be more fighting, you think?  I don't even know.  I mean, I wouldn't want to kind of scare the casual fan with that.  I just think they've set up the sport now where there's...  You play teams in your own division eight times,  and I think any time that happens and you start to hate a team like that,  and it builds up those rivalries that maybe they've had in the past 
[02:03:00]  with the old Islanders, Rangers, and Phillies type of thing.  So, you know, when you see a team that often and players that often,  I think it's only natural that you're going to work up some of that aggression.  In hockey, you're given the chance to, instead of jump around at midfield,  I don't know if you saw the football game,  but at least to kind of take care of it with two guys and under the rules somewhat.  Bring back the bench-clearing brawls.  Those things made you watch every single game. 
[02:03:30]  Your team could be 20 games out.  You don't care because there may be a bench-clearing brawl.  Get some goons in there.  Fill it into the crowd.  Where the ice looks like a yard sale.  There's shit everywhere at the end.  They don't even know how they're going to play the rest of the game.  Goon it up.  Goon it up.  Yeah, because as soon as the fight starts, you're not allowed to leave the bench.  Old days, man.  Everyone jumping over the bench to take care of their own, you know?  Hey, Jeff, it seems like, I know XM just went on in Canada, which is so great.  And hockey is going to be, obviously, a big part of XM in Canada  because Eric Logan made a point. 
[02:04:00]  We weren't too sure why, but Eric Logan said hockey is very popular in Canada.  And how do you feel about that?  How do I feel about how it is popular?  I mean, I would say up there it's the same as NFL is down here.  It's talked about 24 hours a day on TV and radio.  It's their religion up there, the same as it is down here with football.  Baseball.  You know, it will be a big market, I guess, if XM can tap that market  and kind of reach out to that.  Hey, what did you do it yourself during the strike lockout? 
[02:04:30]  What did you do it yourself?  I went over and played overseas.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, a lot of you guys did that.  A lot of staring at the TV in the meantime and sitting in European coffee houses  wishing I was back here.  Why didn't we go to Europe to do radio, Opie?  I don't know.  We could have, like, we were off for two years.  Yeah, we were in a lockout too, sir.  Yeah, call it a lockout.  Don't call it being fired.  We were in a lockout for two years, and we could have gone to Europe and done radio, Opie. 
[02:05:00]  I think some of the stuff you guys got locked out for would be encouraging over there.  Ah, see?  It wouldn't be a bad idea.  Yeah, there you have it.  And, oh, one other rule change that we should mention.  None of these games are going to end in a tie anymore, thank God.  Yeah, I think the shootout will be, at least for fans, not to have to sit through a 1-1 game or 2-1 game.  I went down to the All-Star game.  I think it was, where, down there in Florida somewhere, and, yeah, the game ended in a tie,  and they had the shootout. 
[02:05:30]  The whole place, even though it's a who-cares game because it's an All-Star game,  everyone was out of their minds.  How do you do the shootout?  Because I'm not a big hockey watcher.  How do you do the shootout?  All of a sudden, you know, the game ends in a tie, and then, I don't know exactly,  you take, what, five players from each team?  Yeah, it'd be like a penalty shot from soccer.  Okay.  So then each team, you know, goes for, you know, yeah, a penalty shot, exactly.  And, you know, that team goes, and the next, and the next, and then...  Is it sudden death?  No.  I think five guys go, and then if it's still a tie, then it goes to sudden death. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  It's amazing.  It's so exciting, and it's a great way to end a game.  Are you worried about fan reaction when it comes back?  Yeah, I would expect in maybe non-traditional markets, fans, it'd be tough to get fans back.  I mean, some of the more traditional hockey markets, I mean, you're going to see signs against the players  and against the owners, and I think that's expected, and I think they have every right to do so.  So, I mean, it'll take time to get it where everyone's comfortable with where things are. 
[02:06:30]  A lot of people, our own friend Ben was saying that, because he's obviously a big Boston guy,  how do you feel about the Bruins?  A lot of people are saying they're going to actually do well this year.  The Bruins have been good for a few years.  They've got a lot of the same guys back, and I know for us, they always give us problems.  Joel Thornton is one of the best players in the league, and they've done a good job surrounding him  with a lot of good players.  So, he's got every right to brag a little bit.  Yeah, Jeff, do you fight? 
[02:07:00]  I'm usually good for once a year, just to make sure that I can, when that question's asked,  that I can say there's a few fights.  Yeah, I wonder about the guys that don't fight at all, if they're looked down on in the locker room.  Mine aren't the big Ty Domi, Bob Probert fights of the old days,  but they're not so I can answer that question, honestly.  I hate Ty Domi, but I love watching him play.  There's something about him.  It drives me nuts, but man, that guy has balls.  And he's what, like, how tall is he, 5'4"? 
[02:07:30]  No, he's probably about 5'11", but his head is, I mean...  Come on, he can't be that tall.  He doesn't look that tall on the ice.  No, I think just because when he fights, all the heavyweight fighters now are about 6'5",  so when he fights, he looks that small.  He takes on everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got a squirrely look in his eyes.  You try not to make eye contact with him when you're out there.  He averages a fight a game easily.  Easily, probably two.  Probably two a game.  That's nice.  All right. 
[02:08:00]  I like that.  Jeff, we're here, and you've got to go practice, so...  Yeah, no, thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.  No worries, man.  Congrats on hockey being back.  I'm sure you're very, very happy.  Thanks.  Good luck, bro.  Thanks.  Take care.  Thank you.  Jeff Halpern from the Washington Capitals.  Bro.  Fantastic.  All right.  We should take a quick break, and then we'll get the ladies in, and we'll do some other things.  Oh, we've got to do the fart game.  We have to.  I have to urinate. 
[02:08:30]  Me, too.  Let's go to the same place at the same time and space.  Let's reenact the cake.  The virus is ready.  The virus is insidious.  O-A-Virus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from whores you dump on Norton's belly, the only other girl in this life is Bob Kelly. 
[02:09:00]  Not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock, too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved.  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Bob Kelly.  It sucks being made live. 
[02:09:30]  Hey, this is Robert Kelly.  Come check me out in New Brunswick, that fantastic town.  September 22nd to the 24th at the Stress Factory.  I'm going to be there all weekend with, I don't know, some other hack.  So come on down and see me.  For more information, go to robertkellylive.com.  And stop IMing me going, you think I'm fantastic, and then when I say thank you, and you hit not you, and sign off, that's a very mean thing to do.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you? 
[02:10:00]  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  Is someone changing your face?  It's real, the pain you feel.  You trust, you much, you're sad.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you?  All righty.  Oh, my God.  What's up, Anthony? 
[02:10:30]  Took a leak.  Almost didn't.  Why?  Well, I guess the Ron and Fez staff comes in during the course of the day,  and one of their new interns are here.  Remember Paul?  I talked about him yesterday.  Yeah, I talked about him yesterday.  And he was standing by the bathroom door.  So I was like, oh, if I walk past now, I'm going to have to talk to him and everything.  So what Ben did was just go, Paul, just walk down the hallway.  I made him walk down the hallway.  Here he is. 
[02:11:00]  Hi, Paul.  They hired you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Paul, we've been seeing your face for many, many years.  I've seen you.  Get up on that mic there, Paul.  I know you.  How did you get the gig, bro?  Way to encourage, Hope.  I have a background somewhat in radio and a couple classes taken.  And a background in annoying people.  Oh.  What happened?  He seems like a nice guy.  Paul, I've got to ask you.  Do you know how annoying you can be at times? 
[02:11:30]  I realized.  Did you listen to the yesterday show?  I didn't yesterday.  I was doing, I had to bring a family member to the doctor.  Why?  What happened, man?  They tried to shoot themselves when Paul was talking to them.  But I apologize.  Oh, you do?  No, first and foremost, I do apologize.  But did someone inform you, I guess?  Someone filled you in on what was discussed?  I realized how bad I was, I guess, the next day when I was walking down the street saying 
[02:12:00]  to the friend I was with, she had a friend that, I know, long story, she had a friend call  and say she got kicked out of the house and I was obnoxious and I was drunk saying, doesn't  matter, I still want to, you know, hook up with this girl.  And screaming it while this girl was crying on the other side of the phone.  Uh-huh.  So I realized the next day what I said and how long I was.  How long and how grown I was.  Yeah.  It was, uh, it was, uh, did you notice when you came into Caroline's, did you notice, um, 
[02:12:30]  that I was probably in the furthest corner in the club in a roped off area that was pretty  much away from, there was no one near me.  Did you, like, notice that?  I noticed you were sitting there.  That's all I noticed.  Like, like, there's people in the club.  And then did you notice I was in an area where no one was?  Honestly, I was so drunk. 
[02:13:00]  I just thought you were sitting there eating.  Yes.  Yes, you were drunk.  And, and, uh, after we left that appearance at B.B.  King's and before going into Caroline's where there's a lot of people also, um,  there's, uh, called a wind down time where it's just, uh, me, maybe my chick, maybe one  other person and just wind down a little bit and eat dinner, have a little dinner and maybe  not discuss show related things and, and think, uh, see, that's kind of where I was right then. 
[02:13:30]  And, and, and I'm too much of a nice guy to turn around like Opie would and say, dude,  shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to eat.  So what I do is I try little hints.  Did you notice at one point I actually laid down and made like I was going to sleep?  I certainly did not.  Did you notice that?  I certainly did not.  You were so engrossed in what you were saying.  What you were saying that you didn't notice I was feigning sleep. 
[02:14:00]  When he built a little fort out of seat cushions, it didn't throw you off.  Right.  Right.  What I noticed is absolutely nothing but talking to you.  And I don't honestly remember what I said.  I just.  Yeah.  But, but at the same time.  Well, that's two of us.  I don't remember either what you said.  Jimmy just keeps gesturing to him and making him stop like he's going to say something  and then doesn't say anything.  You are so annoying.  I love it. 
[02:14:30]  So, yeah, that's where we were.  That's where we were that night.  And you just wouldn't stop.  And then, and then did you, did, did it give you a clue when the Carolines people came over  and said that those tables were reserved and sent you to another faraway table that perhaps  that was a way to get you away, did you notice that none of those tables were taken the rest  of the night?  No.  I, I didn't, I was so banged up, dude.  You were really hammered.  I am so sorry.  Yeah.  Would I know, would I remember? 
[02:15:00]  For anybody else, it's not a problem, but he gets like, Anthony is like freaked, man.  He gets like fucking weird.  I try not to, like, say anything, so I just sit there and kind of just deal with it and  roll with the punches, but inside, I'm just, I'm steaming.  Well, you're a nice guy.  And I try to be nice.  And then, did you notice, I was eating.  I was eating my egg rolls.  And that egg rolls are finger food, right?  You didn't notice when the food came?  I didn't notice you were eating at all.  Well, that was the point where you really got close.  I was eating egg rolls.  And then when you finally were told to go to another table, I'm eating finger food. 
[02:15:30]  You stuck your hand out and shook my hand.  That is a huge no-no.  I spent the rest of dinner eating with only my left hand, because I don't care if it's  the Pope himself.  I'm not going to then start picking up food with a hand I just shook.  Because I don't know where you've been.  Maybe the bathroom.  So I had to eat the rest of the night with my left hand.  It was a little blotch on the evening.  And it's not even a personal thing.  He just ended up shaking hands. 
[02:16:00]  Even me.  No, no.  Not real.  It's not his thing.  It's not like a thing from yesterday.  Like I said, I apologize for the evening itself.  Do you notice anything, Paul?  He's doing good.  He's probably a little bit uncomfortable.  It was a little uncomfortable that night.  That's all I'm saying.  When are you going to notice that Jimmy's pretty much holding your hand?  I noticed, but I'm not going to say anything.  You're just going to let another man hold you.  He's holding my forearm, and it was in a friendly way.  It wasn't like...  He's been holding it for a long time now. 
[02:16:30]  Maybe next time when I'm eating, you can come over and hold me like that.  Nothing weird, man.  It's just...  A guy will maybe touch another guy on the forearm for maybe a split second.  Jimmy has been holding your forearm for the last five minutes.  Dude, I am so nervous right now.  Are you?  Jesus.  Dude, I really am.  And I apologize.  I spent all last night going dreading today.  Just because I didn't know.  It was a big deal.  I didn't hear it myself.  I was stressing out the whole night.  And quite frankly, Anthony Wanya fired.  But we told him.  We told Anthony, no, calm down. 
[02:17:00]  I mellowed out, and I calmed down.  It'll be okay.  Because I really...  You were gone.  I apologize.  What is that?  He was gone.  Like, I...  Dude, I wasn't trying to get him.  I can't even fake that I was trying.  I'm so not that guy.  I was...  Well, you were excited to meet Anthony because you kind of admire him and talked to him a  little bit, and you just got a bit overbearing.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, you went from being, like, kind of pleasant to being, like, a... 
[02:17:30]  You know what it is.  Turn around.  Look at that room.  See the room full of guys there?  Wave, guys.  Wave.  Full of men.  Let me tell you something.  Look at all those cocks and balls.  We hang out.  When we do these appearances, we'll drink a few beers, whatever, talk a little.  In the office, we start talking.  But this was...  This was an earned thing.  These guys earned their keep.  Good point, Ed.  And, you know, in days to come, weeks, months, perhaps, you will end up like they are.  But at the start, it's like the replacements coming in during wartime. 
[02:18:00]  You don't want to get to know them too much because they'll probably just end up in a body  bag.  But they might save your life one day.  Why don't you wear one of the laughing hats?  That's a good idea.  You know what?  I think what he's saying right now is that you're Garner.  I think that's what he's saying.  Put a laughing hat on my hat.  It's hard to put a laughing hat on when you've got the headphones on.  Yes.  Well, Paul will wear the laughing hat.  Put a laughing hat on.  Put a laugh.  There it is.  There you go.  Suits them well.  I like that.  The laughing hat.  We've been making everyone do their best laugh because it's Jimmy's laughing hat party here. 
[02:18:30]  Last day on the show for a while.  So give us your best laugh as you wear the laughing hat.  Anything?  It wasn't long enough.  It was a bit stunted.  It was like...  You've got to make it last longer.  Not blow the whole load like that.  Back off the mic a little bit because people get to complain when we shout into the mics.  There you go.  There you go.  Your best laugh.  Make it last a little.  That's my laugh. 
[02:19:00]  Do your laugh.  All right.  Yeah.  Don't say it.  I just tried to come over my head.  I can't even hold it in.  I think it went...  Oh, shit.  But it's not like a spontaneous thing.  Right, right.  You're asking me to laugh and...  It's like acting.  You should go...  Yeah.  That's what Jimmy would do.  That's it.  Yeah, fun.  Yeah.  One more job, though.  One more try.  You're wearing the laughing hat.  Give us a laugh.  You've got to slap your arm a little bit.  That's like a laugh.  Well, that's good.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, not ha.  No, slap the console and go, like...  Ha, ha.  Let it last a little longer.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:19:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, man.  Like...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  See?  See?  It takes us off.  It's dynamic.  It's terrific.  Yeah.  And stop chewing gum.  Sorry, dude.  No, that's right.  He likes to chew some gum.  Who cares if it's on radio?  What are you going to do?  Put it under the console?  No, right there.  Grab that thing right there.  Just put it there.  Put it there before you do a laugh.  No, no.  Give him that thing.  At least he's guaranteed to have fresh breath.  Oh, I like that.  A boy with minty breath.  That's a plus around here, at least.  Okay, one more time.  Slap the console. 
[02:20:00]  Laugh.  A hearty laugh.  And then let it taper off a little bit.  That's right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha.  Ha.  All right.  No one says, ha, ha.  That sounds like a computer laugh.  Look, look.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's a believable laugh.  See?  Nice laugh.  No, no, no, no.  I understand.  Flavor Flav from our show.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  See?  But it's not spontaneous, though.  Yeah.  That's a thing.  These were all laughs on the spot.  But we are, like, supposed to be, you are supposed to be learning about radio in here. 
[02:20:30]  Some shows in radio, they're all phony laughs.  They'll sit there like the morning zoos and, you know, they do that stuff.  So, it's kind of an education in radio to know how to laugh, even if it's fake.  Right.  Yeah.  One more time.  Throw the head back.  A little off the mic.  Throw the head back.  Ha, ha, ha.  Big laugh.  Slap the console.  Let it taper off in a natural-sounding laugh.  All right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Why do you stop? 
[02:21:00]  You stop a little too soon.  Why are you so afraid?  You stop a little too soon.  Look at the clock.  Look at the clock.  You got the laughing hat on, but I ain't feeling the laugh.  Yeah, I certainly do.  Look at the clock, man.  Do a five-second laugh.  You're doing like a...  Five seconds.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's a long time.  You could breathe back in and start again.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how they laugh, though.  Like, just a...  That's it.  That's it?  That's really it.  Wow.  You sound like a joyless pedophile.  Yeah.  One more time.  Go, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Like, breathe in a couple of times.  Yeah, let it last a little. 
[02:21:30]  Let it laugh.  And then at the end of the whole thing, go, ha, ha, ha, like that.  Yeah, that's how you end a laugh.  Now we got it.  All right, go.  Paul with the laugh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Give the spontaneity of a glacier.  I'm sorry, dude.  You're perfect for the Roderick Show.  You are...  Yeah, absolutely perfect.  Look.  See?  I thought, Jim, you were reading the comics again.  That's so natural.  No, he's not. 
[02:22:00]  I am.  He is.  Even a two-year-old can laugh on two.  Come on.  Jesus.  Sorry.  All right.  That's Paul.  Paul, the new intern for Ron and Fez.  Welcome aboard.  And good luck, bro.  And I think it'll be fun.  I think you'll have fun here.  Ron and Fez are great guys.  Earl is a fantastic leader.  He will mold you.  I forget that part.  He'll do nothing. 
[02:22:30]  Mold will grow on him.  Yeah, he'll do something for everybody.  All right.  And good luck to you.  Right.  There you go.  All right.  There he goes.  Remove your laughing hat.  Hint, hint.  There he goes.  Yeah, when we say there he goes, it's...  That's usually your cue to get the fuck out of here.  Jimmy.  More items being added to the Opian Anthony auction.  Totally not.  You can go to opiananthony.com to get the link.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Cal Ripken Jr. baseball autographed is now up for bidding. 
[02:23:00]  The Joan Jett platinum record is now up.  The Ozzy Osbourne platinum record is now up there.  A Meet the Creeps DVD autographed by little Jimmy Norton,  and I'm assuming Club Soda Kenny is now up there.  And you guys can bid on those items as well as a bunch of others being added as we speak.  Yes, Jimmy.  No, he's going...  Ooh.  Oh, okay.  You want to start the...  You want to start the fart game?  I'm scared.  Oh, right. 
[02:23:30]  We had that.  Yeah, we got to get to the fart game.  Mm-hmm.  This is the last day we can play the fart game for a while, so...  No, it's not me.  Yeah.  Can't play it when Jimmy's not here because I don't participate.  That is a rude and smelly game.  Well, maybe they could go back over the archives,  and I'd love to call in and play the fart game  because I think there'd be a different angle on the phone.  Yes.  Well, here's the deal.  So, Jimmy and I cannot play the fart game.  It's usually either myself or Jimmy farting.  Right.  Who wants to play the fart game today? 
[02:24:00]  Anthony, who do you want to take on?  Steve?  Ooh.  Steve played last time, right?  Yeah.  Why does Ben never play?  Ben should play.  Ben should play.  That's a sweet boy.  Yeah, let's get Ben in here.  What?  Why don't we get the...  You want to get Martini Steve in here, or you want to do Ben?  How about Ben and Steve play today?  That's fine.  I don't have to play.  Why does Ben breathe like Jason Voorhees behind the mask?  Yeah, okay. 
[02:24:30]  You don't want to play this?  I've got to do something.  Why do you want to help Earl out with something?  Come on.  Oh, no.  There's no helping Earl.  The lost cause.  I was reading an email the other day, and people are saying they miss you in the studio.  Oh, okay.  No, I'm not even kidding.  They love you in the studio.  I'm not even kidding, because you will laugh just out of control at the best times.  Okay.  No, I'm not even kidding.  There's not even a bit after that.  You've got to show up in the studio every once in a while.  Martini Steve, take a seat.  You're going to play the ball.  Whoa. 
[02:25:00]  Don't touch the cake.  Whoa.  There you go.  I'm trying to convince Steve to change his voicemail to that on his cell phone.  It just plays that and goes to the...  Ben thinks that would be hysterical.  I think it's funny.  It's funnier than those stupid songs you have going.  No, wait.  Did you say voicemail or the ringtone?  Oh, I thought the voicemail, but the ringtone, actually.  That's not a bad idea.  Yeah, I wish I could figure out how to do that.  By the way, Steve, when are the hot girls coming? 
[02:25:30]  Oh, these girls are great.  I'm not even turning around.  They're very lovely.  Adios aren't out there.  Why do you ruin things, Opie?  I'm not ruining things.  Ben said that Steve was getting hot girls for the show today.  I love these girls.  We did.  They're real go-getters.  They are.  Cool.  No, they are aspiring porn chicks.  Really?  Yes, they are.  Absolutely.  Ooh, maybe somebody will get their swank sucked.  Maybe they might.  Would you let them do that live on the show today, Jimmy, as you're going away thing?  Maybe for a second.  It won't...  I remember one time...  We could cover up cameras and stuff.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:26:00]  Cover those up.  I bet you this big fat girl named Deandra, who I used to work with at Bradley's, we were talking  about oral sex, and she was really, like, 350.  And she's like, if you eat my honey, I'll suck your swank.  Oh, that was really awful.  Yuck.  Eat my honey.  All right.  Here we go.  It's the fart game with Martini, Steve, and Ben.  All right?  We play a fart, and then these guys guess who farted, and then we get the answer, and blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Do we get the options of who it could have been?  I mean, how many people have done it besides Jim? 
[02:26:30]  Well, that's the thing.  There's a couple.  Oprah's done it.  I've done it.  We've had a couple of guests do it.  It's actually surprising sometimes who pulls it out.  In all fairness, it's either Jim or I.  Most times.  Most times.  Okay?  There might be a little trick.  A little curveball.  Trick fart.  A little curveball.  You never know.  Tricks are fun.  All right.  Why don't we play the just-made fart jingle, Anthony?  Oh, no.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  That means this game is serious.  If they're making jingles for it, here's the fart jingle.  It's time to match up the gases with the sound of the asses and link up the stink with a name. 
[02:27:00]  Now that you've already smelled it, can you tell us who dealt it?  Because it's time to play the fart game.  Whoa.  Hey.  Bravo.  Well, Steve.  That was me and Danny.  You're a grown man with a mortgage.  I am.  I certainly am.  Two mortgages.  Yeah, I know.  Do you realize you had to sit down with your wife in a bank and sign papers?  It's time to play the fart game. 
[02:27:30]  She looks at you and thinks, this is the man I'm going to stop.  I know.  I trust my financial future.  I have that epiphany once a week, yeah.  And she is as normal as they come.  Yep, she really is.  She is the greatest.  She really is.  You don't deserve her.  You know that, right?  And you know, stupid with holding both ears, it's time to play the fart game.  Actually, it's-  Eyes closed.  Did you sing it for her to get another opinion on it?  No, she hasn't heard it yet.  She hasn't heard it yet.  No, okay.  But it's not- 
[02:28:00]  It's not-  Both hands aren't on.  You've got one finger in one ear and the headphone on the other.  And you can hear yourself first.  And where was Ramon during this?  Ramon was quietly observing.  Yeah.  Your imaginary friend.  Ramon!  Bring me a cake with a black cock on it.  We had to call three bakeries to get this made.  Really?  Yeah.  That's not bad, actually.  Only three bakeries to get a cake with a tits and a cock?  How did you describe it?  Um, I actually- 
[02:28:30]  You know what?  I actually-  What did you say?  I want a cake that's the perfect woman?  I think between Pete the intern and myself, we managed to track down three bakeries who  did erotic cakes and we found one that would actually do a hybrid, if you will, of a male  female and female.  That's good.  You've got a white body with a black cock, too.  Yeah.  I didn't ask for that one, but it's a lot of cake.  I'm going to-  My girl cake!  That white chocolate.  Both frostings will be destroyed.  What are you doing down there? 
[02:29:00]  I'm playing my penis.  Stop that.  Stop that.  I've got to get Bob Kelly on the phone because I just was reminded of something.  After the show yesterday, we went across the street for some breakfast with the waiter  with the crazy wig that we talk about every once in a while.  Do you have that picture that Bob Kelly took?  I do.  Can we get that online?  Yeah, I had a rod.  Old helmet head?  No, we're sitting at the table and this is a nice little joint, Anthony.  Matter of fact, the black dude from Oz was eating breakfast right next to us. 
[02:29:30]  Which one?  At a BC?  No.  The lead of the Muslim gang there.  Oh, that guy.  That guy was there with his fine white girlfriend.  Didn't we once see the guy from ER?  The black guy from ER was in there?  Eric LaSalle, I believe his name is.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, we're just kind of hanging out, you know, very, very nice joint.  And all of a sudden, Jimmy has to announce to myself and Bob Kelly and everyone else around  us that he's sporting a massive hard-on. 
[02:30:00]  Why?  I wouldn't say it was massive.  Dude, it was ridiculous.  Why were you sporting?  Well, maybe I thought I was getting laid the day before, so maybe I took a little pill.  Maybe I did that to be a silly goose.  So I guess he had one of these 10-hour hard-ons there.  You know how it is.  Oh, no.  And of course, now he has to stand up and make us all uncomfortable.  Stand up.  So now he's like, he's popping a tent in his jeans, like, dude, way out to the ear because  he had Becky jeans on. 
[02:30:30]  And what, were you just standing so everyone in the place could see you?  I was pretending I was on my phone.  Yeah, standing, making believe he's on his cell phone.  Talking loud?  Oh, yeah, turning around like his hand on his hip, like, like this.  It's a blurry picture, though, but.  That's horrible.  Hurry up, need to fuck.  I really want to go down on one of them.  Wow.  All right, well, the girls are now putting up signs.  We're going to get to the girls in a minute here.  Did you get your photo with the guy from Oz?  No, because he was there.  I didn't know he was going to eat and stuff, and I really don't care enough.  He's a scary dude, man. 
[02:31:00]  Who would F with him?  He's from London, and he's trained as a dancer.  Oh, really?  Damn, I know I should have talked to him.  Yeah, you could have beat him up.  Are you kidding?  Gene Anthony Ray?  Faggot.  Yeah, that's what it says.  Born in the UK.  Trained as a dancer.  So Bob Kelly took a picture of Jim Sporting with our crazy waiter in the background with  the wig or whatever it is that he wears.  I tell you, you know who he reminds me of?  It's a different color, but he reminds me of Michael Caine from Dressed to Kill. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, my God.  Who is that?  Oh, my God.  It is fucking Sasquatch.  Anyway.  You do hear that.  Yes, I mentioned it before.  Yeah, I know you mentioned it, but I hadn't heard it. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Now I'm hearing it.  Yeah.  Ben.  What?  That is breathing?  I'm breathing?  I was breathing.  Wow.  You are breathing?  We wonder sometimes, too, Ben.  If Earl had asked that question, I would have an answer.  Obviously not.  Wow, that's some heavy breathing, man.  Ben, this is what it just sounded like.  We were all completely...  I didn't realize it was. 
[02:32:30]  I was writing.  So you had to breathe?  Yeah.  Strenuous.  Ben actually said that, like I said, I was running.  I was writing.  What do you expect?  Right.  A pen that's moving my elbow?  Wow.  Cool.  That's something.  All right.  Tomorrow on the show, Otto and George, Bob Kelly, and girls with wow stickers.  Remember we talked about sending girls to Times Square with wow stickers?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So let's play the fart game.  I don't remember the fart jingle, so we better play that again.  Oh, jeez.  Can we play that again, Derek?  Great.  It's time to match up the gases with the sound of the answers and link up the stick with a name. 
[02:33:00]  Now that you've already smelled it, can you tell us who dealt it?  Because it's time to play the fart game.  All right.  So we're going to play a fart.  Martini, Steve, and Ben will guess who farted, okay?  Here's the first fart.  Jesus.  That's all you get, guys.  God, I want to play so bad.  You want to play it?  No, I won't play.  And you might as well.  It's Jimmy's last day for a while. 
[02:33:30]  It's for fun.  Play.  Yeah, you might as well play it.  All right.  I'll play.  We're going to beat him anyway.  All right.  So it's Anthony, Ben, and Steve.  All right.  We'll start with Ben.  Jim.  All right.  Ben's playing the odds.  Steve?  It's Jimmy.  And Anthony?  Yeah, that type of deliciousness isn't covered up with pants.  Definitely, Jim.  I completely forgot about that.  You know what? 
[02:34:00]  I know my farts.  Are you saying that's you?  No.  I'm going to say me.  Wow.  I don't know the answer.  So here's the fart.  Let's get the answer to that first fart there.  You can play along at home, by the way.  Oh, you want to play games?  Yeah, I'll play games.  Point, Jimmy.  That's right.  Damn it.  I play in the majors.  You go play in the little cow league.  Is that the reason for all the Lysol?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We all have our own Lysol.  Well, let me know. 
[02:34:30]  He cut one, too.  Mine don't smell.  Everyone knows that by now.  Rot little oatmeal farts.  That was a great one, because I farted, and then you said you want to play games, and  I thought I had a good one that day.  It's the way it is.  I straighten everyone out.  That one was huge, yeah.  So everyone got a point there, all right?  Take care of all small intestinal business.  Here's the next fart.  We know who that was.  Yeah.  That was a tentative shy boy's fart.  Listen to this thing.  That was your asshole apologizing, as well. 
[02:35:00]  I've got to turn up the volume on it.  Little Pat from Unaki fart.  That's awful.  All right.  We'll go with to Steve.  Steve, who farted?  That's you.  That's absolutely you.  All right.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I'll say that's one of yours.  All right.  Ben?  Yep.  You.  Me?  Let's find the answer.  What's up, Ant?  What's up, Jimmy?  Go ahead, straining.  Oh, no.  Oh, God. 
[02:35:30]  Jeez.  Man.  I saw him lean forward like he was fucking Peter Finch and Network.  Way to deliver the news.  Peter Finch.  Another mic I'm going to have to use.  That makes me so happy.  It's horrible, isn't it?  Mine don't smell, though, for some reason.  Oh, stop it.  They really don't.  Yeah, yeah.  They smell like Hershey's Kisses.  Jimmy's pick up the room, and for some reason, mine don't smell.  Yes, they do.  They really don't.  All right.  You guys got that one as well.  Congratulations.  Here is the next fart. 
[02:36:00]  Please.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, that went tail.  Listen to the tail off.  That is a dangerous fart.  That's when you fart, and you're being hugged by a large man, and you're squeezing all that  goodness out of you.  Thank you, Steve.  Steve, let me give you a little hug. 
[02:36:30]  Steve, what did I tell you?  Sorry.  Don't encourage him.  I believe that the asshole that birthed that fart will be in Los Angeles.  All right.  You say Jimmy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Ben?  Jim?  Yeah.  Jimmy.  Oh, Jim.  Here's how I think it's me, because you can hear at the end, I actually, what I'll do  is I'll lift my leg.  Like, you ever see an umpire call a third strike when he yanks the arm back?  That's what I do, and that's why it tails out.  Oh.  I want you to picture that.  Wait, what happened?  What are you writing there, kid? 
[02:37:00]  I'm getting a communique.  Are you writing, we better cover these cameras before Jim whips his dick out?  Hope that's what you're writing.  Well, this is Danny's game, right, Danny?  Yes.  All right, so get our mic.  Get some credit today.  Don't be shy, kid.  I can't say that, though.  Why?  Don't ruin the game.  Oh, don't ruin the game.  So, what do I do?  You just tell him.  Tell him what?  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, Danny threw a little curve into this version of the fart game.  Whatever.  So, let's find out what this is about.  Damn it.  I don't remember.  The creator of the fart game, Danny, everyone. 
[02:37:30]  Let me tell you something.  I don't remember hearing that tail off.  Really?  That's true.  Well, I guess this is how we'll introduce it.  Everybody's wrong.  That was a decoy.  A decoy.  We would have commented on that tail off.  All right.  Well, here's the answer.  I guess there's a third answer today.  Decoy.  Decoy.  Let me just say.  Wow.  Twist.  Yes, there's another decoy in the game.  Wow.  All right.  So, no one gets a point there.  All right.  Damn it.  It keeps it interesting. 
[02:38:00]  Certainly does.  All right.  We're going to the next.  Let me see.  Okay.  Here we go.  How am I supposed to keep a heart on it if I don't know who did it?  Here's the next fart.  Whoa.  What the hell?  I don't know.  We're going to have to hear this one a couple times.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They couldn't.  They couldn't put two decoys in a row, could they? 
[02:38:30]  Would they?  It's really up to you guys to figure it out.  I don't remember hearing that fart on the air.  Do you know what that is?  That's the sound it makes when you're wearing sweatpants and you fart into the mouth of  an invalid.  I'm going to say decoy because I don't remember hearing that.  Hold on.  It's Ben first.  Ben.  Decoy.  Ben's going decoy.  Yeah.  I'm going at the risk of getting it horribly wrong.  That's decoy.  And Anthony? 
[02:39:00]  I'll say decoy because I don't remember hearing that one.  Everyone's saying decoy.  All right?  It isn't, is it?  What the?  Jimmy.  That was disgusting.  A dribbler.  There you have it.  That must be old.  How old was that one?  It sounds like my asshole got nervous and stuttered.  It did.  It went hum-na, hum-na, hum-na.  By the way, the picture of Jim Norton sporting the wood from yesterday is now up online. 
[02:39:30]  Holy crap.  This should be the cover of your next CD.  It should be the cover of your next CD.  And look at our waiter to the right.  That's our waiter every time we go there.  So go to opandanthony.com or foundrymusic.com.  There's Jimmy standing up taking a phone call as he's sporting a massive rod.  Jesus.  It wasn't massive.  It was a mediocre one.  All right.  Here we go.  So no one got that.  We still have a tie game. 
[02:40:00]  We are horrible.  Tie game.  Let's go to the next.  Ow.  Oh, wait a minute.  My finger.  My fur.  What happened?  It just cramped up.  Let me kiss.  All the clicking I had to do to get to this fucking picture on foundry.  Jesus.  Jesus.  We're fixing it.  How many links do you have to go through?  Click.  Here it is.  You go to opandanthony.com.  Click on the link.  Jimmy's picture.  Click on the link.  Then it takes you to foundry.  To another little thing.  You've got to click on a link there.  And then you get a thumbnail of the picture that you've got to click on. 
[02:40:30]  All of it is being fixed.  Oh, Jimmy.  What?  I can't help it.  I was shy.  Jeez.  He's standing there actually pushing it out further.  It's very funny.  It's a very funny picture.  Very impressive.  Fat neck.  Look at the wig on the waiter.  We love that guy.  He really is a classic.  I was just about to say the exact same thing.  Oh, the waiter's behind him in that?  Look it.  That's the guy we love.  That's a guy.  Yeah, that's the guy.  That's the guy, right.  I love him.  That's a wig.  I want to eat potato salad out of that thing so badly. 
[02:41:00]  Androgynous.  Dolt.  He's very cool.  All right.  Here we go.  Without his wig, he looks like Pesci and JFK when he was dead on the couch.  I can't turn my neck and had it for years.  All right, guys.  Here we go.  Here's the next fart.  That is definitely an opie.  That's it.  Their quick, blunt trauma to the underpants. 
[02:41:30]  They don't have that sharp, high treble that Jim's has.  All right, Ben?  I'll say decoy.  I'm going to say opie.  All right, two opies and a decoy.  I said that was an opie.  How come opie and I don't play just because it's our farts?  What do you think?  We recognize them?  Yes.  I think you would have.  I recognize most of them.  Like one of your young.  I don't even have to recognize it.  I don't even have to look.  This is definitely going to be one of mine.  It is yours.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll continue with Tony from Sink Magazine after the break. 
[02:42:00]  And then, um.  You're cool.  Totally nailed him.  Oh, no.  Yes, that was me.  Yes.  All right.  So, Anthony got a point.  Enjoy.  None for Ben, and Steve got a point.  Ooh.  It's a tie game with Steve and Anthony.  Here is the next fart. 
[02:42:30]  Let's go to Steve first.  Steve, who farted?  Wow.  I'm going to say decoy.  Can I ask you a question?  What were you just weighing in your mind?  Because it could have been open.  It could have been a decoy.  It definitely wasn't one of yours.  You went, um.  Hmm.  Like you had to, you actually went over bass levels.  What did you actually just, let me think about this.  Yeah.  I had to think about it.  What would Ramon say?  I'm playing to win.  Yeah.  Let's go inside this game a little. 
[02:43:00]  When you guys are thinking, what are you thinking about?  I'm trying to picture whoever was, if someone was actually positioned in front of the microphone,  what was the sound that came out of it?  And I couldn't, you know, it was, I was bordering on you, Ope, but I couldn't commit.  So I said decoy.  It's all about tone.  It really is.  One of yours.  All right.  So.  It's an Ope.  And Steve, what did you say?  I said decoy.  Ooh.  Decoy and Ben?  Jim.  All right.  Ooh, Ben playing for the point.  Jim.  Ben's a good boy.  I totally love it.  Answered moi, Steve, decoy. 
[02:43:30]  Okay.  Here is the answer.  That's a lot of people here.  Don't be scared.  Don't be scared, Jim.  There's cameras.  Put on your diaper right on my foot.  Come on.  I'm going to try.  I'm going to try again.  Go ahead.  Give it a shot.  Please, God.  Let them shit.  There you go.  Yes.  All right.  That's another win for Anthony.  Point for me.  Anthony is pulling away here.  Anthony's got four.  Steve's got three.  Ben's got two.  It's a fart game.  Just a couple more left, I believe. 
[02:44:00]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Come on, Ben.  Jump on the team.  Come in for the big win.  Wow.  That could be a Jimmy.  Or a decoy.  That sounds like Travis.  Very middle of the road.  A straight fart.  No chance of being taken with that one.  Not at all.  Just guess.  All right.  Ant, it's to you, I guess.  I am going to say decoy.  Okay.  Yeah.  I concur.  That's a decoy. 
[02:44:30]  All right, Ben.  Decoy.  Wow.  You guys are all wrong.  It's me.  No?  It's Jimmy, then.  Shit.  Whoa.  What happened?  Ope was wrong.  That was a decoy, guys.  It was a decoy.  Oh, I'm really sorry, guys.  Oh, B.  You didn't know.  You're ruining everything.  Oh, my God.  I'm so sorry.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  You're spirling it.  Everyone gets a little point there.  Wow.  Thanks.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I just knew that was a decoy because I would have laughed hysterically at that fart in real life. 
[02:45:00]  Where are you guys getting the decoys?  Those are courtesy of my armpit.  Ooh.  Did I have real farts?  Good one.  I think the first one was.  Actually, the first decoy, I believe.  How about this?  They've got to be real farts.  Yeah, definitely.  They've got to come to that little delicious bottom you lug around.  Me and I think we're trying, but it turns out our asses get shy.  Every time we had one ready, we just couldn't come through.  What do you think?  Strawberry hit homers the first time he got up?  He struck out a few times.  You're absolutely right, Jimmy.  Here we go.  The next fart. 
[02:45:30]  That isn't even a fart.  That's a Tesla coil.  That sounds like...  Doesn't that sound like electricity?  No.  Yeah.  There's something in Dr. Frankenstein's lab.  All right.  Let's go to Ben, who's trailing here.  Ben?  Jim.  All right.  Jim?  Steve?  Sounds like a bare-ass Jimmy fart.  All right.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, what?  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I think it's mine because it sounds full-bodied.  Full-bodied?  It's got flavor.  It's got texture.  It's got personality.  It's thin.  You accuse me of pondering.  Here's the answer.  Thanks a lot.  Tell George he stinks.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You spray my iPod, you fucking...  What are you doing?  Jesus. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, God forbid he tries to spray your area after you showed up.  Out of your ass, then.  You spray me.  You don't blast electronic equipment with a fucking...  How do you turn it around where you get pissed at people?  You just farted...  Not only did he fart.  ...without your pants on, showing the most horrific ass any...  Horrific?  My cheeks are supple and delicious.  Get the camera, boy.  Dude, your ass...  Your ass crack is like two feet long.  Oh.  Is it long?  Is it long?  That sounded like you sat down in a rubber chair with rubber pants on. 
[02:47:00]  It had that squeaky, just flesh.  No muffling.  Wow.  It's cute.  And we're back live.  Everyone gets a point.  Yes, that was Jimmy farting.  Yeah.  You hear that bare-ass sound.  It's just fantastic.  It brings this game to a new level.  All right.  We got two left.  The score.  Ann has six.  Ben has four.  Steve has five.  Wow.  You know what these fans are probably just doing?  They're probably just using farts in the other games.  We'll never know.  Yeah.  We wouldn't. 
[02:47:30]  Well, obviously, that's not a decoy.  That's a double, man.  Two for Tuesday.  After he's panicking in the background.  I got to go.  I got to go what?  I think this was.  This must have been recorded after the show, right?  When we were doing our little production.  Okay.  I got to go.  And I would say that is, it's a little more muffled, but I think this was before Jimmy 
[02:48:00]  started ripping his pants down.  I'll say Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy again.  Yeah.  I know what was happening, too.  I think I know.  All right?  Yeah.  What you were saying was, oh, shit, I got to go under the console and get my nose between  those two lovely globes.  Under the console and get my nose between those two lovely globes.  Under the console to get my nose between those two lovely globes.  I got to go.  No, I know exactly what that was, and I'll wait until after you guys. 
[02:48:30]  All right.  Go ahead.  Steve?  I think that's Jimmy.  Yeah.  All right.  And Ben?  Jim?  Yeah.  I think I was saying I got to go past him and get out of the studio, and I was panicking  because he farted and I had to walk through the fart cloud.  I think that's what it was.  Perhaps.  Here's the answer.  I, um, uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  You got it.  I just don't know if it's going to be substance or not.  Oh, no.  And I'm not saying anything.  No, it's not.  It's actually nothing.  No fucking way.  They're the worst.  No way, man.  You walk by the irradiated zone. 
[02:49:00]  Baby, you're so shy, man.  You fucking farted.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I got to go back in there.  There you go.  Come on.  Get through this mouth.  That's what it was.  I love it.  And we're back live.  Everyone gets a point.  I had to go back into the hot zone.  I remember I left.  I walked past Jimmy.  He was walking out the door when he farted.  And then to my horror, I looked back and something I needed was back over here. 
[02:49:30]  So I had to walk through the cloud.  All right, Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  I'm sorry to interrupt the game, but Anthony, what the hell is a Tesla coil?  You don't know what a Tesla coil is?  No, I'm sorry.  I don't.  It's one of those coils invented by Tesla.  And it makes...  I thought they were just a band.  Yeah.  It actually makes an arcing, an arc of electricity at a very high voltage, and it makes a crackly  sound. 
[02:50:00]  Well, how do you know that?  I think I was...  Wait a minute.  Yes, Discovery Channel.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Yes.  Thank you, Anthony.  All right, the final fart.  The fart game.  Easy.  Easy.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's an easy one.  Well, I'm very confident.  Let's start with Ben, though.  Ben?  Opie. 
[02:50:30]  Yep.  Indeed.  Yep.  Opie.  Yep.  Opie.  Yours always sound like the burp of a sick man.  They're so muffled.  Poor guy has never done anything to us, but we're obsessed with how cool she is.  We like Bob Edwards on a personal level, but I'm sorry, he looks like a dead man when  he walks.  Stop it, Dracula.  Uh-oh.  Oh, God.  Ooh.  Oh.  That sounded like an acid reflux burp.  I'm like, wow. 
[02:51:00]  I can't stay in this room with you guys.  That's it?  All right.  There you have it.  Yes, it was myself.  So, once again, Anthony wins the fart game.  Yes.  Bravo for me.  That's true.  Like a true queer.  I know.  I just, uh, hanging out in here as the observer.  Yeah.  I think I'm kind of getting used to a who's or who's.  It's pretty obvious, I think.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  Most of these farts are very obvious.  All right.  Why don't we end the fart game with the fine fart jingle that Steve came up with.  Hit it.  It's time to match up the gases with the sound of the asses and link up the stink with the  name.  Now that you've already smelled it, can you tell us who dealt it?  Because it's time to play the fart game.  All right.  When we get back, we're going to invite the ladies in for Jimmy.  Ooh, for me?  Finally.  Jimmy heading off to L.A. tomorrow to shoot the HBO series thing.  Whenever I want a big laugh, I tell people I'm going to La La Land. 
[02:52:00]  And, you know, just gets a big laugh from everyone.  Because it's, uh, what, L.A.?  Twice.  Twice.  And they're kind of wacky.  Very funny.  I got a tinkle.  All right.  Well, when we get back, we'll have an Opie and Anthony auction update.  We'll get the girls in here.  And we'll block those cameras.  We'll have another fine hour of radio for everybody.  Because that's what we do on this program.  You're certainly right.  We actually try to entertain people on a daily basis.  Beautiful girls, huh?  Where were you tonight?  The Kit Kat Club?  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  The last time I'm going to ask you. 
[02:52:30]  This guy wants to try to stump Anthony.  Oh.  Taking a chance here, Ant.  That's all right.  Well, the thing is...  I don't want to think that you might have a flaw in that brain.  No.  The thing is, I never said I know everything.  You know a little bit about...  I know a little bit about a lot of things.  All right.  Matt Jersey.  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Good luck to you, Jimmy.  Good luck to you in California, man.  Thank you, buddy.  Can you guess...  Anthony, can you guess Tesla's nationality?  Tesla?  Yeah, Nikola Tesla. 
[02:53:00]  We mentioned the Tesla coil.  Yeah.  I would assume he is German.  I say Danish.  No.  What was he?  He's actually Croatian.  Was he?  Yes, he was.  Cool, man.  Call back next week.  We're going to have a whole trivia thing.  Good.  What a guy.  Obscure 80s people that you don't know the nationality of.  Thanks for...  Croatian.  Thanks for starting the Who Cares game.  Who Cares?  Write that one down, boys.  The Who Cares game.  Who Cares?  All right.  As we go to break, a good friend of the show, Stephen Lynch, he has a new CD out called The 
[02:53:30]  Craig Machine.  We've been featuring tracks off and on the last couple days.  Yeah.  I really, really liked his song when he did it on our show for the first time.  But here's his version on...  Well, here's another version of the song on his CD, The Craig Machine.  It's called Albino.  Albino.  I wanted to write a song about the three loves of my life that have, you know, slipped  away somehow, but I could only come up with two.  I was in love with an albino. 
[02:54:00]  Her lack of pigment seemed like fun.  Her skin, the whitest alabaster, her eyes as pink as, pink as bubblegum. 
[02:54:30]  Then one day it snowed real hard and she disappeared.  That's one.  Here's two.  I loved little Agnes Johnson. 
[02:55:00]  I met her at the old folks' home.  She'd call me up and say,  Hey, Stephen, come give old mother Hubbard a ball.  Then one day her EKG went beep, beep, beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep.  Beep. 
[02:55:30]  Beep.  Beep.  Hi, this is Jay Moore.  Hey, this is Chris Jericho.  This is Bernie Gepp.  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio.  This is Bill Burr, the red-headed white boy from Chappelle's Show.  This is Lois Griffin from Family Guy.  Hey, this is adult film star and former gubernatorial candidate, Mary Kay.  This is Jeffrey Ross.  Hey, this is Terry Jones here of Multibibus.  Hey, what up, y'all?  This is Tracy Morgan, a.k.a. Brian Fellows.  Hey, this is the game Triple H.  This is your big baby girl, Patrice O'Neal.  How are you, sweetie?  Hey, it's Colin Quinn. 
[02:56:00]  This is Ken Seth Thomas.  Hey, this is Seth Green.  Hey, this is Rich Voss from Last Comic Standing, season one and season three.  Hey, this is Tommy Chong.  Hey, this is Larry the Cable Guy.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  And y'all listening to O.P. and Anthony.  You said you're smart.  You're not dumb.  Like people think.  I got an email from one of our listeners. 
[02:56:30]  They're saying that they were at a Disturbed show.  And I don't know.  There was all sorts of O&A references at the show.  Oh, yeah?  It was either by the band Disturbed or the band warming up for them. 
[02:57:00]  And all their, like, I don't know, vans and buses and stuff had wow stickers.  It was a whole big thing.  I want to get to the bottom of that.  I'm guessing Jaegermeister.  That would be very, very cool if Disturbed is listening to his program.  I'm guessing Jaeger has something to do, too.  Maybe turn it on to it.  Because Jaeger is big supporters, man.  And they were doing the Disturbed tour.  Okay, because we love Disturbed.  And I guess this band that warmed up for them at this particular gig, big fans as well.  So I'll try to bring the email in.  I just remembered as that song was playing there. 
[02:57:30]  All right, we got girls for Jimmy.  We got girls.  Girls.  Beautiful girls.  We got beautiful girls.  A couple of very beautiful girls, isn't it?  Well, we got a couple of girls, yes.  That's cuddles.  You ruin it.  Girls and Toys, courtesy of Robin at MySexyStore.com.  We love Robin.  Oh, yeah.  We haven't seen you in a while.  How's your mom?  Good.  She missed you guys.  Lovely.  She said to tell you everybody hi.  All right.  Your mom is a goer. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Your mom's a goer.  Isn't this your birthday today?  Hey, we have to give a shout-out really quick to Salisbury soccer team.  Jason bashed up his arm, so I told him I was coming here, and he's a huge fan.  Yeah?  Who's Jason?  This guy that I know, and he's a college student down there, and they're like third  in the country right now, so I told him I'd give a shout-out.  Look at Jimmy.  Do you like pussycats?  Jimmy's having a collar put on.  Uh-oh.  Not too tight.  Just for the record, they brought all sorts of stuff from my store, guys. 
[02:58:30]  It's going to be bad.  Watch his foot.  Yes.  Very tender.  He's got a foot thing on his foot.  He's got a tender foot.  And now he has lipstick all over his neck.  Red lipstick.  Yeah, the girls.  Valentina.  They made me a little note here, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Valentina is the girl with the big boobs.  She is.  She is the girl with the nicest ass in the world.  And you're the nicest ass in the world?  Yeah, and Nicky does have a nice ass.  I can do this.  Look, Jimmy.  Look.  Look at that.  Wow, wait.  Spank it.  Do you like pussycats?

Why don't you hit the girl?  Don't practice on me.  Is it too hard?  No.  Okay, good.  What?  Is it my turn?  What's that?  Is it my turn?  You want to spank?  Uh-oh.  No, I want to spank you.  I don't get spanked.  I'll show you all mine.  All right, you cut a little bit.  Okay.  We're going to get the pussycat.  Don't do it too hard.

Oh, you guys using this?  Huh?  What do they think?  I'm a wacky bachelor? 
[03:00:00]  Do you understand?  I'm a hardcore pervert.  Wait, what are they using, Jimmy?  What are they using?  I don't know.  Some toys.  It's a...  Now she's dusting my ass.  Of course, it's a nice hiney.  It looks like...  I don't like being spanked.  It's a kid.  It's a cat.  Guys, we really got a mic to...  It's something that he spanks, she spanks guys with.

That's good.  And then spanking you with some type of cat thing. 
[03:00:30]  Flattened cat.  What's that?  Do we get to tie you up?  Never, no.  No, you don't tie me up.  Behind you?  You can't tie me up.  No, just something little.  He doesn't like being tied up.  No, I'm a pervert.  No, I'm not a submissive.  I'm a dirtbag.  I'm just trying to play with you and keep you from...  No, he'll do other things.  Trust me.  He's a pervert.  He just doesn't like that type of thing.  What will you do for us, Jimmy?  What they're worried about is I'm going to touch him.  They're worried I'm going to do something really awful.  Touch us?  She has a nice cheek.  I don't want to sit on you.  Can I take this off?  Yeah, you might as well take that off. 
[03:01:00]  It's very hot in here.  She does have a fantastic height.  So Valentina's the one with the big boobs, and Nikki can be seen at Madam Orr's.  Madam Orr's and Teasers.  And Teasers on Route 11 in Binghamton, all the way from Bingo Town.  They are.  How to travel all night, huh?  I think I went to Teasers for a bachelor party.  Are you totally shaved?  Yeah.  A little strip.  Where's my seat, Eric? 
[03:01:30]  So can I put these on me again?  I can't put them on, huh?  What do you want to do?  What the hell are those?  I just want to put these on behind me with some of your chairs.  No, I won't get tired.  I'm probably going to touch my nipples.  See, you'd like to...  The nipple suckers!  Oh!  Oh, they're like superheroes.  To the nipple suckers!  They've got a toy for everything.  And they go into their utility belt.  I try to bring a plethora of different stuff.  There's one.  Well, thank you, Robin, from MySexyStore.com.  Oh, look at the plug.  Thank you so much.  Do you like your nipples sucks, Jimmy?  Yeah, but not by...  Do you like them?  They're not bad. 
[03:02:00]  Can I bite your nipples?  Don't bite, no.  Lick only.  Sucks.  No biting.  All right, I guess that would be Valentina going to town on Jimmy's nipples.  I want to get done.  How's that, Jimmy?  It's really fantastic.  It's fantastic.  Now they're both licking Jimmy's nipples there.  Oh, my God.  You guys have made them wait.  Haven't you seen them out there?  Oh, by the way.  Just like...  A lot of this action will be taking place on the Liberator.  Ooh!  Oh!  That is so disturbing. 
[03:02:30]  What is that?  Because he's got these two black things on his nipples.  They're like...  They're vacuum things.  They're like sucking...  They're called nipple suckers.  Nipple suckers.  They're literally called nipple suckers.  And what are they doing, Jimmy?  They're kind of just like...  Jimmy and sexy on the 90 days.  Are they massaging or are they just...  Not bad.  They're actually...  They're actually...  She's actually rubbing something on my hog, which is...  It's a lipstick.  It's a lipstick vibrator.  A lipstick vibrator.  Courtesy of mysexystore.com.  All right.  For all your sexual needs.  All your sexual needs. 
[03:03:00]  Nice.  All right.  What are the girls doing now, Jimmy?  Not bad.  I don't know.  I got these nipple things on.  I feel like a silly goose.  Your front looks like JonBenet's back.  There's nothing there.  A fist mark in it.  Oh, well, they're on each other now.  Now the girls are...  They wouldn't even have sex last night  because they were saving themselves for the show this morning.  Oh, really?  Really?  We've been waiting.  Getting all damped up.  You girls have aspirations or what? 
[03:03:30]  Yeah, they want to be porn stars.  I don't know if it's words.  I'm foreign.  Yeah, she's from Russia, so sometimes she doesn't understand.  Russian?  Yeah, speak Russian.  Okay.  Wow, that's so sexy.  Isn't it?  She's either saying, I'll suck your cock  or you're being sent to the gulag.  I didn't look there to eat my pussy.  Oh, really?  That's not bad.  I need a puppy to come here, my chocha.  Wait, say that again.  I need a puppy to come here, my chocha.  What are you?  It doesn't want to stick to your nipple.  I'm French-Canadian. 
[03:04:00]  French-Canadian?  Yeah, but I don't know.  And a Russian.  Ukrainian.  Look, I'm Ukrainian.  I make this sexy for you now.  My women are so much better.  What are you talking about?  I make this sexy for you now.  You give me the...  Make it sexy for me, baby.  You give me the money.  I make this sexy for you.  He's a good guy.  What are you doing?  Are you a cowboy?  He's a cowboy.  Who's a cowboy?  We want to ride a cowboy.  Excuse me.  Jimmy's lonely over there.  Yeah.  Jimmy wants to watch.  Jimmy's a little bored at this point. 
[03:04:30]  What are you doing?  Nice.  That's good.  Do you want to move him to the Liberator, girls?  Yeah, let's do it.  Ooh.  Be right back, guys.  Go to the Liberator.  Go to the Liberator, Jimmy.  What is this thing on my head?  Oh, that girl's sitting on a dildo.  The Liberator couch for all your sexual needs.  I was doing a little work.  I fell off the ladder.  Right up my ass.  All right, the girls.  There they go.  Her butt's a little red from where Jimmy spanked it.  Jimmy was spanking, and now...  He told us we can't be naughty out there, so this is going to get naughty. 
[03:05:00]  You could be naughty right there on the Liberator.  Yeah, sure, it's going to get naughty.  We hear that all the time here on the Opinion Program.  Wow, all right.  Are you girls getting completely naked?  I was hoping.  Well, hope no more, because you can just take everything off.  Look at Bill in the next room sharpening a knife.  No being shy here.  That's right, Dan.  Carry a coffee.  Way to keep the sexy vibe going.  Fucking creep you are.  He's got the coffee and a camera. 
[03:05:30]  How jaded are you?  Bill porno producer.  Take it off.  All right, both girls are now completely naked.  Nice.  Jimmy just went in for a sniff.  The girl bent over.  One of the girls bent over, and Jimmy just shoved his nose right up her.  Oh, she's calling in the strap-on, Anthony.  Jimmy, will you put the strap-on on me?  Yeah.  Jimmy, would you put the strap-on on her, please?  I've never done that before, but I'll give it a shot.  Yeah, see, I bet you're good at it.  Go ahead.  Miss. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Oh, that girl's playing with that girl's vagina.  Yeah.  If I could use sexy terminology.  What the hell is that?  Hold on.  Which way goes, this is regular?  All right, Jimmy is...  Jimmy, it doesn't go up your ass.  Put it on the girl.  I'm testing it.  All right, Jimmy is...  You're a plastic cock-blocker.  Jimmy's helping the girl get the strap-on on.  Yes, the strap-on.  Oh, my God, you have nice bosoms.  What am I...  I'm sorry I'm not being very helpful.  The girl has now got the strap-on all by herself. 
[03:06:30]  Jimmy is not even involved now.  She pretty much said, give me that, fool.  Wowee.  Now she's got it strapped on.  It really is fantastic.  The other girl is kneeling down, kind of in front of her.  Do you want to suck me off?  She's fastening, and now she's sucking the dildo.  We've seen this a lot in Penthouse and other magazines.  Sure.  We're not really a big fan of the sucking off the dildo on the girl.  No, that's sort of odd.  It's an odd thing, but it's okay.  Well, there's a little trap door on that.  That's all right.  Oh, a trap door. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, so she could get to the girl's...  Pussy.  Pussy, right.  That's the word I was looking for.  Oh, wow.  I was going to say vulva.  Why is Bill in the studio?  Oh, Bill.  How you doing?  Hey, Bill.  How you doing?  No reason to be in here, guy.  There's really no reason?  That's all right.  He's a good egg.  All right, well, Valentina is now on the Liberator.  On the Liberator, using the lipstick vibrator.  Trying out a few sexual positions on the Liberator.  Oh, boy.  And now... 
[03:07:30]  I had a spin on it, because we didn't bring lube.  That's okay.  Use that prison lube.  That's good.  That was very sexy.  That's cell block three lube.  That was a very sexy maneuver there.  Now she's...  You have really nice breasts, if you don't mind me being bold.  Wow.  If I may be.  So both.  Jimmy, what do you think?  Very nice.  Why don't we get down to the action there?  Oh, look at Jimmy's thumb.  Huh?  Just do it, baby.  Do whatever you want, baby.  Yeah.  Jimmy's going away for it.  You girls, you girls can get as absolutely hardcore as you want. 
[03:08:00]  Just say that.  I'm not holding that.  Jimmy's got something else in his hand.  We got some major girl-on-girl action, Anthony, on the Liberator.  That's good.  With sex toys, courtesy of mysexystore.com.  Wow.  All right, let's listen in.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Let's listen in.  I'm a professional pussy eater.  Oh, yeah?  Professional pussy eater there.  I got some good shit.

I bet many men, I bet you many men want to have sex with your titties.  Slut.  Oh, you're sluts.  I'm sorry.  Sometimes I don't know the difference.  I apologize.  How many Russian men want to fuck those titties?  Very good.  Big.  I need one of these at home. 
[03:09:00]  All right, let's listen in now.  Are you a cowgirl?  I want to ride.  Thank you, cowgirl.  I like the fact that Nathaniel is just miking the vagina.  Yeah.  He knows where the mic's supposed to be.  Jesus.  Hey, she's now using the strap-on, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[03:09:30]  The one with the huge boobs is on her back.  They're shaking.  Getting a good shot there, Danny.  Yeah, thumbs up.  Thumbs up from Danny.  All they're wearing is a strap-on and boots.  She's going to town with the strap-on.  Holy mackerel.  Wow.  What a ass.  Wait, she wanted a better position.  Well, the liberator will give you that, Anthony. 
[03:10:00]  Yes.  I like it, man.  The liberator.  Thank you, Will, for the liberator.  Yes.  Hey, why is Ronnie here?  This show doesn't start for 40 minutes.  Hey, look, Ron.  Hey, Ron.  She's doing some show prep.  She's doing some filing.  You all filing?  Just filing, that's all.  All right.  Why don't you come on in and check out the action, Ron.  All right.  The girls are really going at it now.  This is the real deal for once.  Yeah, Ronnie, get in here and see what this... 
[03:10:30]  You've got to see what this satellite radio can do.  Yeah, this is what the satellite radio can do, Ron.  This is like taking a Ferrari out on the highway.  Unfortunately, Fez is throwing up down the hall.  Yeah, why isn't Fez in here, Ron?  He's sick.  I don't know what's bothering him.  A little stomach problem.  He's trying to figure out what he's all about.  All right.  What happened, girls?  A strap broke?  It's too loose.  Too loose.  Hey, Anthony, it's too loose.  They've got to adjust the strap.  Strap on?  Don't stop now. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  There, you fix it.  Okay.  You fix it.  Or after somebody fix it.  Jimmy?  Hurry!  Hurry, Jimmy, hurry!  What do I do?  Jimmy.  Hold on.  You have to help, miss.  I don't know what to do.  I love the fact that...  My finger keeps slipping in.  I love the fact that a rocket ship...  ...was involved in letting people hear this.  That actual rocket had to go into outer space to give you people this. 
[03:11:30]  How great is that?  Yeah.  All right.  Ron, what do you think of the girls?  Interesting.  Very interesting.  Yeah.  The Cold War is over.  The Cold War is over.  It certainly is.  She's French-Canadian, and she's Ukrainian.  We've gotten rid of the Iron Curtain and brought in the Meat Curtain.  That's right, Anthony.  Beautiful.  I love about...  All right.  Let's listen in, Anthony.  They're going at it again.  The stop-on has been fixed. 
[03:12:00]  All right.  You jaded ass.  Right already.  Ladies, I don't know if we're impressed yet. 
[03:12:30]  Ron?  Yeah, I'm very impressed.  The whole simulated terrestrial days are over, huh?  Yes.  All right.  Now they're kissing, because that's what you do after hardcore strap-on sex.  That's right.  Hey, ladies, are you going to involve Jimmy in any action here?  Well, he's a pussy.  Come on.  Oh.  Well, what should I do?  Hey, you're going to take that, Jimmy?  Oh.  Oh.  What's this world coming to? 
[03:13:00]  You've got to let it play with you.  What should I do, ladies?  Drop your shirt.  I'm going to take my shirt.  I'll lift it up.  I won't take your shirt.  Dancy talk.  I'll lift it.  Dancy talk.  I'll lick my nipples.  I'll lick my nipples.  Just lick.  No, no.  Just lick the nipples.  Please, just be good.  I, for Christ's sake, would you just...  No biting.  Just lick.  Just be good people, would you?  For the love of God, I'm going to get on an aircraft tomorrow morning.  Just lick.  Atta girl.  Just lick, ladies, and enjoy.  There you go.  That's all he wants.  There you are.  Jimmy? 
[03:13:30]  I probably couldn't get around with all these people.  Look, ow, don't bite.  I don't like being bitten.  Just suck gently.  Just suck gently.  Jesus.  How could I not stop, Lundgren?  I will bite you.  No, I'm not tense at all, actually.  I don't really like to get spanked.  Jimmy likes his nipples played with, ladies.  It's your birthday.  He needs to get spanked.  I'm 37.  I know.  I'm an older gentleman.  Ladies, he likes his nipples played with.  Yeah.  He doesn't.  That'll get some major action going. 
[03:14:00]  Oh.  I've seen more hair on a shark.  She's actually doing something.  The guy is like an infant.  I am.  Ow, don't bite.  She bites too much.  What's she biting?  Why do you bite so much?  Why is she biting?  I get excited.  Do you really?  Yeah.  That's cool.  It's like Bob Kelly's fucking dog.  She just bites.  Wait, what was she doing?  She nips a little.  You said something was going on there.  She was doing something on my...  Nah, I'm...  He's taken.  Right here, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  She was doing something on my... 
[03:14:30]  On my taint with a vibrating thing.  And she was kind of biting my helmet like sucking the...  They're out of the girl.  She was kind of like, ooh.  Ooh.  You have heavy birthing bosoms.  Wow.  Those are nice.  I didn't mean to touch them if you don't...  Are you sure?  I don't want to get yelled at though.  Tee hee.  But no, she was biting my...  The old hep dispenser through...  Through the...  Yeah.  Through the... 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, come on, baby.  Put your mouth around the old life shortener.  Alright, what do we got going on now, ladies?  Oh, they're...  They're switching positions, Anthony.  You want to do me talking?  They've handed over the...  The strategy she has.  Alright, switch.  Nice.  Alright.  Somebody want to help me with this?  Jimmy.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy can do it.  He's Jimmy right there.  She has one of the nicest asses I've ever seen. 
[03:15:30]  While there's a break in the action, we want to thank Robin at mysexystore.com.  Alright.  Your ass kind of reminds me of Travis.  And of course, the ladies.  You can see him at Madame Orr's and Teasers on Route 11 in Biggest, New York.  I'm tightening this up.  What?  Can you hold on?  Oh, for...  Hold on there, you silly goose.  What's going on there?  What am I missing, Jimmy?  I don't know.  I'm too busy.  She's on my face.  Is she?  Can I see?  Wow.  What a good time for the game. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, well, look at what's going on now.  She's squatting right over her face.  There's a little face sitting going on.  Are you mad that I'm touching your nipple?  No.  Thanks.  I don't think.  I'm sorry.  Atta girl.  Just drop a log.  No, it's looking.  Are those tattoos of Stalin?  Yeah.  They're naked chicks.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  You can see too. 
[03:16:30]  I'll go through it.  Hey, there's a 69 thing happening here, guys.  I see.  These girls are good.  What was that?  Someone's stomach, or was that a vibrator?  No, it was a vibrator.  It's okay.  She purrs a lot.  You thought Jimmy was getting his wish?  I don't know what the hell was going on.  She purrs and she bites.  Ooh.  Jesus.  Right in there.  Digging right in.  Jimmy, what will make you happy?  This is all for you, obviously.  Oh, whatever they want to do.  You're leaving for L.A. tomorrow.  Whatever would make me happy?  Yeah, what would you like the ladies to do?  I want them to do that while Eric blows me. 
[03:17:00]  Bon voyage.  We could get Fez in to suck off your cake if that was doing anything at all.  Where's Fez?  I wanted to see.  He's ill.  He's completely ill.  I got a tight pussy.  What?  Keep living here.  Yeah, I got a tight pussy.  You had it.  Oh, Fez.  Oh.  Fez.  Maybe it was something I ate.  I don't know.  What a fucking sitcom entrance. 
[03:17:30]  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Maybe it was the bad Chinese.  I don't know.  Do you think that could have been it?  I just all of a sudden got really ill.  Fez, you want to get involved with the two girls?  Take a look at this.  What do you think, Fez?  What do you think?  I'm coming up.  The position works.  Fez is from behind.  You can get a doggy style.  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  Show her who costs.  Can you put it in her hiney and yell,  My supper was cold? 
[03:18:00]  All right, we got some.  Oh.  We got some hard cold.  Shh.  What?  You're fucking like a little whore.  It's popping out.  It happens, right?  All right, let's go, ladies.  Don't be discouraged.  All right.  Wake up.  All right, there.  I do feel bad for guys. 
[03:18:30]  Wow.  What do you think there?  It's kind of dead.  Strong.  Strong.  Ukrainian woman.  I make the fuck of you now.  Now I fuck you in the fashion that is sexy.  I treat your nipples like the cup of a cigar.  I bite them and spit them out while you're trying to maintain erection in front of 15 people.  I will fuck your ass whenever the fuck I please.  We're getting this on video. 
[03:19:00]  Yes.  Yeah.  It will be sold on the streets of New York by Friday.  Yeah.  Now this video will go up to help out the hurricane victims.  Of course.  Yeah.  Some of them.  Some of them that need to come.  All right.  Wow, ladies.  That's wonderful.  Oh, wow.  We want to get Jimmy.  She looks right around.  I'm happy just to watch.  All right.  I don't think I'm going to get blown, so I'll just watch and enjoy her purring. 
[03:19:30]  Anybody want to blow Jimmy?  Fan?  I don't know.  Anybody want to blow Jimmy?  Mars?  Do you want to blow Jimmy?  Come on.  How do you think you got this internship?  Thanks.  Bye.  Wow.  Oh, hi.  All right.  Did the ladies have a grand finale in them, or what?  I just came all over your time.  It's the Liberator you came all over.  That's right. 
[03:20:00]  It's called the Liberator.  That's right.  We want to thank the fine people at the Liberator Company.  Yes.  For giving us this couch.  We're going, Steve.  Getting her all moist down there, and she, uh...  Jimmy, come here and help me.  All right.  Will you hold my leg?  Jimmy, hold her leg.  Wow, you have a nice one.  This is cool.  You got a good view, right, Jimmy?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Looking right down on it.  She's working the strap on again.  Does it help?  Yeah, I have to be trapped. 
[03:20:30]  Jimmy.  Guys, this might be a little awkward.  We have Barry Zito on the phone.  Woo!  Barry?  Yeah?  Do you really want to be on the show at this moment?  It sounds like I want to jump in, whatever.  It's wonderful.  We're watching hardcore girl-on-girl action.  Oh, wow.  Because one of our buddies here, Jim Norton, is going to Hollywood to film an HBO series  starting tomorrow.  So we're throwing a little bye-bye party. 
[03:21:00]  That is outstanding.  So, Barry, how do you feel about the wild card race?  Woo!  I got to, uh...  Man, we don't have to talk about baseball.  No, huh?  I mean, if you want to talk about girls and girls, but...  It's very hot.  If you give us an address, we'll send the video of what's going on in the studio right  to you.  We'll send that exit to you.  You'll have it by tomorrow.  Wait.  Wait.  We better listen in, because this is a big finale coming up. 
[03:21:30]  Right.  And scene.  Wow.  There you have it.  Very nice.  The fine ladies, uh, you can see them at, uh, Madame Wars and Teasers on Route 11 in  Binghamton, New York.  Great job.  Great job.  There they are.  Wow.  Barry, good luck following that.  Yeah, seriously.  Wow.  We've been waiting out there? 
[03:22:00]  You've been waiting out there for a long time?  Yeah, these girls were waiting out there and getting all worked up.  Yeah, they were, uh, they needed that, Barry.  Um, okay.  Sounds like you guys need some ice water or something.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, we have Barry Zito on the phone.  Yes.  They're still naked.  As soon as they get some kind of, uh, clothing on, I'm sure we'll be able to concentrate a  little better here, Barry.  All right, uh, Barry, what's going on?  What, what are we promoting today?  Uh, what are we promoting? 
[03:22:30]  Strikeouts for Troops, possibly.  Strikeouts for Troops, yes.  Strikeoutfortroops.org, right?  This is another great cause.  It's a program, yeah, that I started in, uh, the off season.  And, um, it's just, you know, to help out all the troops that are coming back from, you  know, wherever they're at.  Uh-huh.  And help their, uh, help them get their family out to the hospitals and their kids and stuff  like that.  So, I'm donating a hundred bucks a strikeout to them, and, uh, so are a lot of other players  across the league, and, uh, you know, the money's going to a good place, man. 
[03:23:00]  It's helping them get clothing and entertainment, and, uh, like I said, fly out their wives, their  kids.  That's pretty cool.  How well are you doing?  How well am I doing?  Yeah.  Meaning?  Strikeouts.  With the, uh, strikeouts?  Uh, we're doing well.  We're doing well.  We, uh, we got some, we're picking up some momentum, and, uh, it's kind of a, you know,  we don't want to be a flash in the pan, so we just want it to be, uh, you know, over  the next couple of years, something really exciting.  Yeah.  Cool.  Oh, Barry, I think the one girl discovered, uh, a G-spot or something here. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I hear you're an accomplished guitarist.  Yeah, I like to do that in my spare time.  I've been playing about six years now.  Cool.  You should see the tits on this one.  Man.  They're fantastic, Barry.  Barry, you were on, uh, the David Letterman show?  A couple years ago, yeah.  I bet you he didn't give you a hardcore girl-on-girl action.  No.  I was trying to meet Mandy Moore in the, uh, in the, uh, you know, the green room.  Ooh.  Her public.  Yeah.  Kind of crappy.  Yeah.  Her what? 
[03:24:00]  She, she was getting her makeup done or something, so.  Kind of got big-leagued a little bit.  Are you kidding?  They wouldn't let you, uh, meet, uh, Mandy Moore?  Nope.  Nope, nope, nope.  What the hell, man?  Barry Zito should be able to meet Mandy Moore.  Yeah.  I would always, always want to meet the other guest.  I would never be told no.  Well, uh, we hate publicists in general because they just, they just cock-block a lot of things.  They're awful.  They really do.  They're the worst.  Holy crap.  Ladies, what's going on over there?  Barry, this might have been a bad time to take this phone call, I'm thinking. 
[03:24:30]  Why?  What's wrong with that?  I like Barry.  Barry's a good man.  You really are going to send me a video, huh?  Yeah, it's really hot.  If, uh, well, yeah, we'll put you on hold.  We'll send the video, uh, right out to you and the boys.  Wow.  I hear you're also a surfer and a photographer.  Yeah.  I got some, uh, you know, I live in Cali in the off-season, so I, uh, I do quite a bit  surfing in San Diego and Los Angeles.  Cool.  I like to do photographs.  I wish I was there now documenting.  Yeah, me too.  I'm actually working on, like, a little tabletop book. 
[03:25:00]  It's called Jerk Off While I Look at This.  That's outstanding.  That's outstanding.  This guy's all right.  Barry, you're all right, man.  Ah.  And his, uh, we were just going through your bio here, and your uncle is Patrick Duffy.  Yes, he is.  How about that?  He's an actor.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's an actor.  He was, uh, you know, in Dallas and stuff.  Did you get to, like, hang out when you were a kid?  Go to the set? 
[03:25:30]  Well, we grew up, I didn't have much money growing up, so I was always, the, uh, we were  always waiting for, you know, Uncle Patrick Duffy's presents to come, and it was always  the best present of the year.  Really?  He hooked you up?  Yeah, it was, uh, and sometimes, I think, I don't even think they wrapped the presents  themselves, so there was always, like, price tags on whatever it was, and, you know.  They just sent people out to get you guys gifts?  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, and they wouldn't take the price tags off, so it was kind of like, uh, sometimes  it was kind of funny.  You still hear from him?  Yeah, yeah.  We're actually, um, we became, you know, closer, I think, and, uh... 
[03:26:00]  Well, since you, you know, have notoriety of your own.  Are you now sending him, uh, Christmas gifts?  Exactly.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  That's a pretty cool little trivia thing.  How was it working with Chris Isaac?  Oh, that was great.  Chris Isaac's a great dude, man.  He's funny as hell, and, uh, the chick on that show was hot as hell, too.  Yeah.  Kristen Dottillo.  She's, uh, yeah, that was fun, man.  I got to do a kissing scene with her.  How do you feel about nipple play? 
[03:26:30]  I like my nipples played with a lot, and I had them both sucking my nipples, but the  one kept biting, which I don't particularly care for.  Some people like nipple torture.  I don't.  I like a little biting, because I'm not completely sensitive there.  Wow.  So...  She just called me Jerry.  Hold on, I just want to show you.  If you think you've had no impact in life, they're here just to kind of celebrate the  fact that I'm going away for a couple of weeks, and she called me Jerry.  And my name is Jim.  Jerry, you should only get cancer.  Jerry.  Jerry, just eat this pussy. 
[03:27:00]  My grandson's in the hospital.  I think it was a Jerry's Kid joke, because they were teasing over here.  They're mean.  They're Russian.  Yeah, Russian chicks.  They're like Soviet block.  Where'd you guys find these girls?  I don't know.  They're from this lovely, large-breasted girl, MySexyStore.com.  They sell all kinds of things like dildos and vibrators, and actually these little nipple  suction cups, which I wanted to not like, but they felt pretty good around my  little nipples.  I have very small, pink, hairless nipples.  But they looked ridiculous.  They look silly, but I have like little pregnant rabbit nipples. 
[03:27:30]  It really conjures up an image.  Hold on, excuse me.  Hey, Eric, way to go.  Way to stand right there so I can't see this vaginal eating.  Thank you, sir.  He's just holding a mic in midair with his nice cheeks.  Jimmy, why don't you come over here and watch them?  Because I'm afraid that I touched your breast and he got mad at me.  Because he's conducting an interview.  I like it when you touch my breast.  You didn't get mad?  No.  I love my nipples suck.  Oh, my God.  Well, Barry, we've lost Jimmy as far as this interview goes.  Barry, do you have any other musical gigs coming up? 
[03:28:00]  We do gigs in L.A. in the off season.  So we try to play sometimes during the season, but it gets tough, man.  We actually played a couple spots in Boston.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Barry, Jimmy went in for the kill, man.  What's that?  Jimmy just went in for the kill.  Did he get into this?  Oh, yeah.  Hell, yeah.  He latched on to a big one.  So, Barry, how do you feel about Randy Johnson's performance this year?  About what?  He's asking questions in the middle of sucking. 
[03:28:30]  This is the strangest interview I've ever been a part of.  You got a boom on him now or what?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're trying.  How do you get my dildo?  He's in the middle of the action.  Sorry.  All right.  Ladies, you have a question for Barry Zito.  That's a no.  Why?  You don't know who he is?  He's a very famous ball player.  Huh?  Barry Zito, you have a...  How big is this count?  Oh, that is a no.  All right.  There's a question for Barry Zito. 
[03:29:00]  Barry, did you hear that question?  What did you say?  Are you going to have to repeat the question in between orgasms there?  I'll ask.  Barry, how big's your cock?  Just, yeah, well, it depends on the mirror that I'm looking in.  Sometimes I got the fun-sized mirror, like, at the circus.  I like that one.  Those are the best ones.  Oh, well, really.  Wowee.  I got to be honest, Barry.  I have, right now, I have underpants full of clear stuff.  Oh, God. 
[03:29:30]  Barry, how do you feel about charges if the ball was juiced and stuff like that?  No, no, I'm sorry.  I'm just pinching a really large breast.  Those are really lovely.  They're what?  How big are those there?  34 double D.  34 double D, Barry.  But she can barely talk at this moment.  Real thick.  They're real.  They're real.  Her gut's real, too.  Jim's underwear looks like the underside of Raleigh Fingers' hat brim. 
[03:30:00]  Actually, Gaylord Perry's, because he always had stuff.  Right, Gaylord Perry.  I didn't want to bring the word Gaylord into this.  All right, I could have went with Phil Necroft.  There you go.  Hey, look, you're leaning against me.  Isn't that nice?  We're kind of like a team.  Yeah, great.  You guys fucking, I'm furniture.  Barry, you guys got a game today?  Yes, we do.  We're in Cleveland right now.  Oh, nice.  How's Jim Tomey?  Tomey is good.  I think he's in Philly, though.  Oh, okay, I'm sorry. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, that's all right.  Wow, wee.  Barry, I think you're going to have a really bad game,  because you're going to be thinking about this when you're in the batter's box.  Oh, man.  Why would Barry be in the batter's box?  Oh, good point.  Oh, my God, why did I say that?  Because it was a bullpen.  Yeah, I know.  I'm a little distracted.  Barry.  Sure, hold on.  Barry, I hate to put you on hold.  Yeah, put me on hold.  I'll give you an address, and you guys can get back to your...  Yes.  Well, it's called...  It's www.strikeoutsfortroops.org.  It's a great, great cause. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, thanks, Bob.  Yeah, check that out, and yeah, hold on.  We'll figure out where we're going to send this tape.  All right, it's Barry Zito, everyone.  Later, man.  Look at Jimmy's position.  He looks like a midwife about to birth a baby.  Yeah, he does.  What is he doing down there?  Jimmy, what are you doing?  I'm putting the...  Teamwork, teamwork, Jimmy.  Teamwork.  There's no I in team.  There's one in age.  LOL.  He's got the dildo.  Yeah.  And the other girl's using the lipstick vibrator. 
[03:31:30]  Do it, do it, do it.  Jerry.  Go, Jerry.  Yeah, Jerry.  Is that okay, the way I'm putting it in and out, miss?  Yes, mister.  Is she getting close there?  I don't know, but the one is spitting all over it, which I kind of like.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You like spit, don't you?  We don't have any lube in here.  We do.  Where is it, for Pete's sake, these poor guys?  They're getting back in the cupboard over there.  Oh, get out the lube.  You mind that I'm touching your hiney?  I don't mean anything by it. 
[03:32:00]  We have a lube cupboard?  Yes.  Oh, you guys haven't found the lube cupboard yet.  XM supplies it for all their studios.  Hey, coming up in 15 minutes, Ron and Fez will be finding homes for puppies.  All right.  Homes for puppies on the Ron and Fez show.  I'm going to tune in.  Right now, Jerry looks like a shoe salesman that's gone too far.  Jerry.  Jimmy.  Is that okay?  Oh, yeah.  Wow, that was a lot of lube you just dumped on her.  Yeah, that was good.  When I'm in front of you, you need it.  Lube is good.  I really have the old drying effect. 
[03:32:30]  Your nickname's Bounty.  Jesus.  Is that okay, the way I'm doing it?  Harder.  All right.  Harder.  Harder, Jimmy.  Okie dokie.  That's Jerry.  That a girl.  Okie dokie.  Palm it, palm it.  Like that.  Palm it.  Oh, that's good.  Wow.  Gee, that's way to be loving.  He's teaching you a lot.  Let me just palm this right into your stomach.  Ow.  Sorry.  Jesus.  That's so hard.  Make up your mind for Pete's sake.  Is that okay?  I don't mean to palm it so hard.  The power just went out in L.A. 
[03:33:00]  Is that okay?  This is the same way Fatty Arbuckle killed that woman.  Right.  You've got to be very careful.  Who choose?  Walk into a bar.  He punched her.  He actually gave her an uppercut.  Unbelievable.  Oh, my God.  Frank.  Frank, do I run as Fez?  Hi, Frank.  Fez, what do you think of the action?  Come on.  Get involved here.  I love their boots.  Jimmy has a way of turning her pussy into a scene of the Grapes of Wrath.  I really am. 
[03:33:30]  Inept.  Anything going on there?  Yes.  But for some reason, now that I'm here.  Oh, she's getting up.  Oh, she's walking away from you.  I actually made the rubber dick go soft.  Good job, Jimmy.  What's that, miss?  No, that's probably just the slime from my hand and the lube.  Good job, Jerry.  Good job.  Jerry came through.  She's very sexy.  You're all very sexy. 
[03:34:00]  I'm actually kneeling on my bad foot.  I didn't even notice.  Yeah, of course you didn't.  God, you have really, really sexy girls.  Okay, Mars, that's something to wipe my hand on.  Oh, she's titty-fucking her with the dildo.  Look at that, wiping it off.  I like that.  Eric.  Because you, Ukrainian titties.  Should we go for a grand finale, ladies?  What the hell was that?  Yeah, there's other things.  Jimmy's giving right hooks to her vagina.  You know, what do you, how about we have a, how about we have an orgasm contest? 
[03:34:30]  See which lady could have an orgasm.  Go first with the vibrators?  Well, you both go at the same time.  We see who could finish first.  I need a higher speed one.  That's right.  Yeah, she needs a higher speed.  Higher speed.  I know, I know.  Fez, go grab the blender.  No, I don't think anybody who's got any car batteries you can hook up.  No, they've got one that's on the board.  What about Steve's hybrid car?  Yeah.  Can't that work?  All right, here we go.  The ladies.  Don't look at her allowed.  Lopey, find Steve.  Help Steve get in here.  He's got the other stuff I brought.  All right, let's get Steve. 
[03:35:00]  Whoa.  There he goes.  Nice.  The studio's very, very proud.  He's trying to find a parking space.  He's hovering right over her genitalia.  Someone's going to have to move out of the way so Steve can land this damn thing.  Nah, he's going around again.  Circling again.  He's trying to find room.  Steve, right there.  Right below you.  Right there.  There's the spot.  Ah, here he comes.  Careful, Steve.  Went to the Joe Klecko driving school.  It's very, very scary. 
[03:35:30]  All right, Steve.  What are we talking about?  I don't know.  Why did we need Steve?  Yeah, exactly.  There was some extra gimmicks that they brought in they can't find.  Where are they?  The ones that I brought last time?  I think they're in the closet.  All right.  Right over there.  All right.  Up on eBay.  Yes.  I'm sure they are.  All right, the girls are having an orgasm contest, Anthony.  Oh.  Ladies, good luck to you.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[03:36:00]  All right, they're going tat for tat right now.  This tranny cake is delicious, too.  This is fantastic.  It's a great going away party.  Guys, we saved you a piece of the cake, by the way.  Enjoy.  At 11 o'clock on the Ron and Fez show.  The pubes are delicious.  That chocolate has enough.  All right.  We have Valentina and Nikki.  Who are you betting on?  I'm going to go with, um, I'm going to go with Nikki. 
[03:36:30]  I got 100 on Nikki.  I think they're both ones.  Good point, Ron.  Good point.  Yes, the workers must unite.  Oh, that's nice, Steve.  Ah.  Oh.  God damn.  That's great.  Maybe they could scale that.  Butt plug.  Look like a vase.  That's Fez's.  All right.  The girls are having an orgasm contest. 
[03:37:00]  Who's in the lead?  Who's in the lead, you think?  Wow.  Yes.  Who?  Nathaniel, you can talk.  Ukrainian.  He can.  I think Valentina.  Valentina's in the lead.  The one with the big boobs.  The 34 double D's.  All natural.  All natural.  Barry Zito banged Alyssa Milano.  Really?  Is that true?  Her first year on that show.  It was today after this call. 
[03:37:30]  This is neighbor.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  They're both getting really close.  Are you almost there yet?  Yeah.  So close.  I think I'm a little help back. 
[03:38:00]  Sorry, my face does nothing.  Jerry is ruining everything.  Oh, I think she found the combination.  Yeah. 
[03:38:30]  All right.  All right.  Oh, I'm a broad, buddy.  Wow, wow.  Let's hear it for the ladies.  Good job.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Bravo.  Very lovely. 
[03:39:00]  It's Nikki and Valentina.  You can see them at Madam Orr's and Teasers on Route 11 in Binghamton.  Which one of you wants to do porn?  Both of us.  Actually, I think you lost a C-note on that one, too.  I think the other one came in first.  Biggin came in first.  That sucks.  Do you do girl on girl or both?  Yeah, what kind of porn do you ladies want to do?  Male domination.  Male domination, huh?  Do you do golden showers and tingle on people?  Oh, you're shy.  No, they pay me the big money.  All right. 
[03:39:30]  The big money.  30 bucks.  And Valentina, what kind of porn do you want to do?  Hardcore.  Valentina.  Girl on girl.  Girl on girl.  Girl on girl.  What about you take it in the ass?  Only from her.  Oh.  Really?  Yeah.  No guy in the porno?  She doesn't want to fuck me in the ass.  Guys can get tied up and watch.  That shit's actually very hot.  That's going to be very hard to sell, though, with the internet and look so hardcore.  You need a pop of those.  Don't want to buy that.  You need a money shot.  You need a pop shot. 
[03:40:00]  We need one of those dildos that squirt the car.  No.  Mitch, you're missing a point here.  Get one of those.  You're missing a point.  Jules Jordan is the biggest because he has really hardcore, like, camera right up to the  ass.  That's why those, like, evil angels, those guys are the biggest.  They don't...  Fetish stuff sells.  Yeah.  But if, like, you're just having a dildo...  It's a little niche.  It's niche, you know?  You're not going to make the big money.  You got to get into, you know, gang bangs, double penetration.  Are you trying to insinuate something?  You want to do my first one right now?  No, no.  It's just the way it's got to be. 
[03:40:30]  Even blowjobs.  Yeah, things like that, like Slap Happy.  Yeah.  What about a musical?  No one ever really brings that up.  No one ever does.  Populous show tunes.  You'll be dressed up like the lion and I'll be the tin man.  And every time the lead goes to sing, an actor just jams us cock in her mouth.  Don't cry for...  All right.  Once again, let's thank the ladies.  We're running out of show here.  Ah, wonderful. 
[03:41:00]  I also want to thank Robert from mysexystore.com for bringing in the sex toys.  I want to thank Will for getting the Liberator that we use from time to time here in the  studio.  A fine sex couch, the Liberator.  Coming up on Ron and Fez, we'll be doing Green Acres Trivia, so stay tuned.  Yeah, stay close to your phones, everybody.  And battle of the sexes.  Secret word is Haney.  I hear this is just like Earl's going away party at any W.  Is that true?  Earl was on the Liberator. 
[03:41:30]  And Jim's only leaving for two weeks, you know.  Yeah.  When did he see us this coming back party?  It's going to be great.  Oh.  Going to love it.  That's right.  That cake brought to life.  You guys were very fantastic.  What a lovely party.  Thank you.  Because we have women in here all the time and they just do nothing.  Isn't it amazing?  It actually worked today.  Yeah.  I know.  No frustration.  They came in.  You girls did exactly.  We didn't even have sex last night because we were excited about having it tonight.  And porn stars don't have sex tonight before. 
[03:42:00]  Right.  The right way.  So we were getting wet.  All geared up.  Ready to go today.  Wonderful.  You got me all wet.  Getting your outfits back on.  Oh, Jimmy, too.  You helped.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I'm sorry some gas slipped out.  I got nervous.  I get scared.  Yeah.  He hearts right into the mic.  Ron and Fez, how was the first show on XM?  It was awful.  It was awful.  Yeah.  We really miss you guys.  We just really want to come in and hang out with you guys.  Just do.  Why can't we do both shows at the same time?  Right.  Is what I'm saying.  I have these chicks back every day.  Well, we never played the dice. 
[03:42:30]  No.  Next time.  Next time.  You're supposed to lick my question mark.  Where's your question mark?  I don't know.  You guys want the girls for your show?  A little crossover here?  Fez has a flu.  It's the only problem right now.  Fez has a flu.  No, you can do anything to me.  They sign our best.  A carton of cigarettes.  Yeah.  They're yours.  I just want to find out if she finds moose and squirrel.  What?  Natasha.  Where does Boris?  Sorry, girls.  Fez is very old.  It's a black and white cartoon he's throwing. 
[03:43:00]  Thanks for blowing up our spot, Fez.  I was just worried about Crazy Cat and Ignatts.  Wow.  Seeing what they're up to today.  Wow.  The Cats and Jammers kids.  You're going to need a visit from Speedy Alka-Seltzer after this.  How was Earl's first day as the executive producer?  Earl actually did a very good job.  Oh.  Very good.  Bravo.  Good.  Good to hear.  All right.  You guys will find that as time goes on, you fall right back into it.  Before you know it, you've got girls doing unspeakable things. 
[03:43:30]  But now you can speak them because it's Sex and Satellite Radio.  Let's say hi to Fan Dick as one girl spanks the other.  Fan Dick.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Today I learned I'm going to miss Jimmy more than I thought I was going to.  Good luck to everybody.  Thank you, man.  I'll see you guys in a couple weeks.  We'll talk to him.  Yeah, man.  He'll be calling in a lot.  He's not really leaving.  I'm just in and out for the next couple of months doing this gig.  It's not on leaving the show.  I'm not going anywhere, bro.  No, I know you're not going.  I'm just saying when you're not there, I'm going to miss you.  Thank you, buddy, very much.  All right.  Later.  Oh, jeez.  Danny's falling over the microphone.  Yeah, way to go. 
[03:44:00]  Good job.  You're like Kubrick now.  All right.  Anything else we got to plug?  That tiny.  Wow.  Jimmy, give us a call soon, all right?  Before the end.  I'll call you guys this week.  I'm going to dumb boss's wedding on Saturday.  I'm going to fly to fucking Edmonton because this pussy-whipped idiot couldn't get married in the States.  Nine hours of travel on Friday, nine hours on Sunday.  That's the only reason he's leaving this week.  Or we could have had him the rest of the week.  Yeah, because of dumb boss's wedding.  There will be another divorce in his life, by the way. 
[03:44:30]  I know.  I'm the best man.  You'll have to call in with the stories from his wedding, all right?  Yes.  Yeah, I've got to write a speech.  I want to hear the toast.  Yeah.  I should record the goddamn thing so we can play it.  Here's to all the guys in the rest area.  The rich is blown.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
