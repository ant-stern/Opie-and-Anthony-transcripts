<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts expressing exhaustion while preparing for a Chicago broadcast.  They detailed their packing anxieties, particularly one host's obsessive shirt-choosing process.  The conversation shifted to a recent on-air confrontation with "Gary, the weasel," a superior, and the potential repercussions for staff, especially E-Rock, who faced significant travel complications due to a standby flight.  They also discussed a newly born nephew, their children's reactions to their absences, and their post-show Chicago plans, including casinos and restaurants, mentioning potential guest appearances by CM Punk and Huey Lewis.  No guests were in studio during this segment.

The show continued with a passionate discussion about exceptional meatballs from a New York City restaurant (possibly "Meatball Obsession").  This transitioned into details about their Chicago show at 115 Bourbon Street (doors at 2 PM CT), the possibility of an extended broadcast and post-show hangout, and more playful teasing of E-Rock's travel arrangements and perceived complaining.  A substantial portion focused on merciless mockery of E-Rock's Facebook profile picture, described as an awkward, over-Photoshopped attempt at a sexy photo.  The conversation then veered to Lolo Jones, a female hurdler, her media coverage, and speculation about her virginity.  This was followed by a discussion of Randy Travis's drunk driving arrest while naked, ELO, 70s music, and Roy Orbison's perceived status.  No in-studio guests were present.

The next segment began with a discussion of Randy Travis's arrest, leading to a conversation about nudity and vulnerability with their children.  This was followed by a tense exchange with producer Troy over a dismissed audio clip.  The discussion continued with music (ELO and Randy Travis), their Chicago trip (including a planned police ride-along), flight seating arrangements, and a humorous Dublin flight anecdote.  A significant portion involved a sarcastic review of Dr. Drew's celebrity rehab show and a surprisingly serious discussion about addiction and recovery.  The segment concluded with off-topic discussions about dressage, Opie's childhood rattlesnake encounters, and his desire to retrieve his deceased father's guns from his stepmother, leading to discussion of her behavior.  Producer Kenny provided intermittent, comedic travel updates.

A later segment covered the decline of reality TV shows and their participants (Jason Davis and Leif Garrett), a discussion about the TLC show featuring Abby and Brittany Hensel (conjoined twins), a live read for Cougalife.com, and a surprise in-studio appearance by Mike Tyson.  The discussion about the Hensel twins was graphic and sexually suggestive, expanding to other conjoined twins.  The conversation with Mike Tyson covered his Broadway play, past behavior, and reflections on his life, often profane.  A listener phone call with a distinctive voice prompted gender speculation.

The final segment focused almost entirely on Mike Tyson.  He shared brutally honest reflections on past relationships, particularly his ex-wife, recounted numerous street fights, a beating by two women, and discussed infidelity and continued sexual relations with exes. He discussed his attraction to "crazy girls," his relationship with his children (including a humorous anecdote about his daughter's African boyfriend), and promoted his Broadway show, "The Undisputed Truth."  He also touched on insecurities, particularly about his literacy, and his desire for a better relationship with his children.  The segment concluded with comedic banter and further promotion of his show.  The hosts and Mike Tyson used profanity extensively throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Put enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes.  Oh, man. Hi, everyone.  Why the hell do we have to broadcast today? We've got to fly.  My God, man.  My God.  Good morning, everyone. 
[00:00:30]  Hello.  God, I know shit.  I'm so tired.  Are you tired?  I'm tired. I just make believe I'm not.  That's what you got to do is just make believe you're not sleeping.  I didn't sleep.  I tossed and turned all night.  Me too. I come back. I ate too late like I hadn't eaten all day.  And I eat like pretzels. I have three Weight Watcher ice cream treats.  You love pretzels.  I do. I'm a pretzel boy.  Weight Watcher treats are not going to work if you have three of them. 
[00:01:00]  Well, they're only it's a total of five points.  This is not bad.  It's not bad.  Which Weight Watchers treats?  The chocolate covered raspberry ice cream.  No, those are good, though. Those are two points.  How good are those?  I have these mocha fudge ones that are one point.  Each has two of them.  And this other one, the three points.  I think there's caffeine in the chocolate.  Yeah.  I packed this morning.  That's my thing.  What time did you get?  I could never do that.  I padded.  I woke up an extra ten minutes early to pack. 
[00:01:30]  Oh, nice.  And I can't pack the night before.  It drives everyone around me nuts.  Why?  My wife, it drives her nuts.  It drives Kenny nuts.  Because Kenny feels a responsibility, I guess.  Jeepers.  And other people.  I just run around the house in the morning packing.  I can't do it the night before.  Why is that?  I don't know.  And, you know, I have to lay out every single one of my...  Do you want to hear about this really fast?  Lay out?  I lay out every single one of my shirts.  Yeah.  And I go through it one by one.  And then I select shirts that I might take. 
[00:02:00]  Do you wear the panties your mother laid out for you?  Then I lower it down to the possibilities.  And then I finally pick what I'm going to travel with.  And I do all this in ten minutes, by the way.  Ten minutes.  That's it.  Yeah.  Well, it's like everything is there.  I mean, what are you going to do?  What are you looking for?  I think it's the OCD in my stupid head where I start looking at shirts and going,  But I like that shirt, too.  I can't draw...  Wait, I like that one, too.  And then I overpack.  I have too many shirts. 
[00:02:30]  And then I get to the hotel or whatever, and I'll wear the same shit for the whole weekend.  And then I come home with all these nice, freshly folded clothes that I never even touched.  But they're wrinkled from travel, so if they get rewashed, they can't even wear this.  Oh, see, I'm not alone with this crap.  No, but you know what helps me with it?  Because we all are afraid of underpacking, is knowing that you have enough on your credit card.  If you've always come to work, you can buy something.  You can always just buy it, right?  If you really needed something, you could get it.  And that helps me a lot.  Like, I know if I'm in desperate need...  What are we, animals?  You buy it.  I'll buy it. 
[00:03:00]  That's it.  I haven't had to do that more than once or twice.  Correctamundo.  What I'm freaking about right now, though, is I forgot my travel hoodie.  And Jimmy walked in and goes, I love...  He goes, I love flying with my hoodie.  And I'm like, I know!  I gotta get my lucky hat.  I'm not flying without my lucky hat.  It's the Yankees?  You can't fly to Chicago with a Yankees hat.  No, I was thinking that, but then I said, fuck it.  I, yeah, I had a Jets t-shirt I really wanted to wear.  Yeah.  I don't care. 
[00:03:30]  I have a Knicks shirt.  I'm like, you can't do that.  It's Chicago.  Yankee hats are just statements anyway.  It's not even like the team.  People wear them all over the place.  I don't need a hat for that.  I'm a douche.  That's probably what other cities say, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then, uh...  I'm a douche.  And I'll just...  You know, we do have people with kids out there, so I'll say this.  My kid knows now.  When I leave, it sucks.  Yeah.  It sucks. 
[00:04:00]  He's like, don't leave, he said last night.  Oh, man.  How does he know?  So what do you tell him?  Because I guess we were just talking about the trip to Chicago and stuff, so he wouldn't  leave my side the entire night and just kept saying, don't leave.  He's only two years and three months.  I like to go and say he's 25 months, because that makes more sense, but it drives people  that don't have kids crazy.  Oh, the month thing?  But it drives people that don't have kids crazy.  Yeah, you could just round it.  My sister had a baby yesterday.  You could just round it up.  What?  I'm a new uncle.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Really? 
[00:04:30]  You ever shoot a baby last night?  I got the text at 1230.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Yeah, it's funny.  I'm a new uncle.  That's...  Yay!  Boy, girl, what do you want to...  Let me teach you what you need to do.  Boy, girl, what do you want to say about it?  Nine pound boy.  Nine pounds.  Nine pounds.  Nine pounds.  Damn.  And I, for some reason...  That's a big baby.  I kept thinking she was having a girl.  I don't know why I kept thinking that.  Wait, she didn't know?  No, she might have known, but I had it in my head that I was going to have a niece.  Right.  But then I'm like, oh, no, because now that's why I mixed them up.  Right on. 
[00:05:00]  That's very cool.  Congratulations to your sister.  Yeah, yeah, I'm very...  Who's an awesome person.  I like your sister.  Yeah, I'm happy for her.  That's pretty goddamn cool.  Yeah, 9.3 pound fucking...  So she gave birth to a fucking offensive lineman.  That's a big baby.  Yeah, it's a big kid, right?  That's a big baby.  She's going to tear shit up.  Yeah.  Tear shit up on the way out.  Yeah, it's a big baby.  Damn.  Yeah, so...  Congratulations to her and your parents there.  Yes, I'm a new uncle.  I'll be a monkey's uncle of nights.  Oh.  Chippy, don't play that. 
[00:05:30]  It's too early for that, right?  Oh, no.  I need my coffee before that shit kicks in.  Fucking hilarious.  I'm more accepting, but holy fuck, now it's 6.15.  6.15.  This is a new tagline.  But my...  Yeah, my son's like, don't leave.  Ugh.  He messes you.  Ugh, it sucks.  He kisses little cheeks when you go.  Ugh, bye.  It's horrible.  And then he gets an attitude when you do return.  Like, where have you been?  And then he doesn't want to acknowledge you for like six hours. 
[00:06:00]  And you have to like...  You gotta work it to get him back in your good graces.  You gotta work it.  He gets pissed.  Kids adjust quickly.  That's what it is.  You're gone for more than 20 minutes.  They just assume you fell down an elevator shaft.  Life goes on.  Oh, they're aware.  I was telling that before the show.  These kids are just fucking aware.  That's what you realize when you have one.  How much shit they pick up on.  But Chicago's gonna be fun, huh?  Oh, man.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to this one. 
[00:06:30]  Shouldn't we leave for the airport soon?  Just in case traffic and stuff.  You know, we should probably go like now.  Sam, we gotta go now, I think.  Sam?  Can you get the guys?  It's our choice.  Generally, yeah.  I would say, no, you can't.  You have to stay until 10.  But I guess you have a choice.  It's our choice.  Tippi, don't play that.  Oh, nice one.  That was a good one.  Wait, we have choices around here?  I guess so.  That's what we learned yesterday.  Yeah, that's what I learned.  A lot of choices.  Sam, I swear to everybody that I did not ask you this before right now.  Oh, shit. 
[00:07:00]  I need to know if you got the famous talking to from Gary after the show yesterday.  Because I will say this.  I don't know anything.  And I swear, I don't know anything.  I haven't talked to any of these guys.  But what happens is when we beat the shit out of Gary, the weasel.  He did it again.  He then turns around and beats the shit out of you guys.  Oh, boy.  Did you get the shit beat out of you because of what we did to Gary on the air yesterday?  I did not get a single talking to.  Yeah.  Nice.  Nice.  He's learning. 
[00:07:30]  Good.  Not you.  Gary's learning.  You're transitioning from staff to talent.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  I think you might be transitioning.  Yes.  Erock, did you get a target, too, even though you had nothing to do with that whole hour yesterday?  Transitioning from fat to fatter.  Oh, come on, man.  All right.  Erock?  No, I did not.  Oh.  All right.  They probably wrote him a little harder, though, about the countdown or something.  Oh, really?  You've got to get on the ball about this.  It'll all come out in the warsh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, we have guys that work for this channel that really want us to keep all that shit 
[00:08:00]  off the air.  Yeah.  Maybe he should read my Twitter.  People really enjoyed the beating he took because a lot of people can relate to that shit.  Yeah, I got a lot of Twitter comments on that segment.  Right.  But for some reason, he wants all that off the air.  How dumb is that?  It'll be funny because he didn't talk to Erock about it at all.  But wouldn't it be funny if they came after Erock in other ways?  Of course.  Like, they didn't mention that segment, but he just leans his head and, you having fun  at the board, cocksucker?  All this inappropriate work talk. 
[00:08:30]  They just berate her.  I shouldn't play this card, but I love knowing that there's nothing those guys could do.  Yeah?  I love it.  They just have to take our shit and eat it.  Oh, man.  I love that.  Because guess what?  Coming up in this business, I had to eat a lot of shit.  Oh, yeah.  And it's coming out in weird ways now.  Erock, when are you flying into Chicago?  Why is Sam laughing? 
[00:09:00]  I just thought of something.  Move on with Erock.  What?  Is it true that you just cost the company $800 because of us yesterday?  I would say you cost the company $800.  Not me.  I'm one guy.  You as a collective.  I'm not taking the blame for everything anymore.  You as a collective.  Thank you.  Yeah.  The show.  Because of that whole thing with Sam and, you know, obviously, there's a very good chance  he wouldn't make the pre-show.  Now he has to fly today.  That cost the company how much?  Oh, man. 
[00:09:30]  I think it cost around $800.  $800.  You know how much that bothers them?  Oh.  Oh, they hate like $10.  By the way, that's for an economy.  Class C.  Yeah.  $800 to change your flight.  24 hours out, man.  That's disgusting.  What's going on with these airlines?  I don't know.  It's a lot of money.  They have these weird rules that make no sense.  Didn't it used to be maybe $100?  Yeah, I guess so.  And even that seemed like a lot at the time.  You'll still pay that, but it's like that's given weeks out.  If you're two or three weeks out, you'll still pay $100. 
[00:10:00]  No, I remember changing my flight day before maybe.  Back on the Pan-American Clipper.  Yeah.  Perhaps.  And they would charge you $100 and you would be pissed off at that because you're like,  really?  I'm just moving to another seat.  Yeah.  They charge like a $100 or $150 change fee and then you have to pay the difference in  the ticket.  And when you buy a ticket day of or day before, it's just grossly more expensive.  Yeah.  They just know how to get you.  So.  But E-Rock.  Yeah.  There was a laugh there, Sam. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  No.  Do you know something?  No.  I was watching, I don't know, some show last night.  I don't know.  Let's move on to E-Rock.  Oh.  E-Rock.  Hello.  Fan fiction.  Fan fiction.  What's going on with you, E-Rock?  Well.  Wait.  There's really something going on?  I don't know.  There's always stuff happening at the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on, E-Rock?  E-Rock.  Can you move that mic so I can see that little sweetie bitch?  You bet, Sam.  Thank you.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  That's good.  Well, my flight didn't change per se. 
[00:11:00]  I still have my 9 a.m. flight on Friday.  But because of now the concerns with other travel arrangements and possible thunderstorms and delays,  it was asked of me to maybe arrive at the airport at 4 a.m.  and try to get on a standby flight each hour until my original flight. 
[00:11:30]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Wait, what?  What happened?  Because of someone's incompetence, what do you got to do now?  Well, I have to go to the airport at 4 a.m. and try to get on a standby flight each hour until my original flight.  Well, we're waiting. 
[00:12:00]  Yes, you are.  When's your original flight?  At 9.30 tomorrow morning.  So you would have probably left at 7, maybe?  7.30?  Oh, no, you're in Jersey, so you could have left even later.  I would have left about 7.30.  7.30, so now you have to go to the airport three and a half hours before you had to.  With the possibility that maybe you'll get in earlier flight.  Dude, I had to sit through standby and not get on a flight.  It's awful.  When they're calling all these names and you're not getting on, it's the worst.  And four hours at an airport is like...  It's terrible. 
[00:12:30]  How many hours in real time?  In regular, I'm walking around lifetime.  That's like five hours on fire.  This is why, by the way, I was bothered when I was told that I chose to fly when I flew.  Yeah.  Because now half the staff is in the same situation as EROC.  Yeah.  And that's the implication is that half the staff chose to fly on this flight that was a  bad idea from the beginning.  Well, nobody caught it.  That's the lack of communication.  Nobody caught it.  I think people catch it, but then they also know that it's like talking to a wall. 
[00:13:00]  And that's why we bring it up on the air and then things are taken care of.  Yeah.  And Troy...  I really believe that, to be honest with you.  I think Troy's in the same situation as EROC, which means at 4 a.m., Troy and EROC are  going to be stuck in an airport together waiting for a flight.  No, that's not true.  Why?  Because Troy's at a different airport.  Where's he going?  LaGuardia?  LaGuardia.  Why is he in a different airport?  That's the airport he picked to fly out of.  I was so hoping...  Why can't everyone just fly nice at the same time?  Troy doesn't drive, so I think it's just easy to catch a cab.  He maybe wanted to go to LaGuardia, because for him to get to Newark, it's harder. 
[00:13:30]  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  But he's in the same situation.  Wait, does he have a...  He drives, right?  No.  I think he has a license.  He doesn't have a car, though.  When was the last time he drove?  Probably years ago.  He lives in Manhattan.  That'd be hilarious to watch him drive.  No kidding.  Be all fucked.  Yeah.  Zigging in a zagging.  He's giving a driving test.  There's a lot of people that live in New York that never got their driver's license.  Yeah, Roland doesn't have a license.  Roland doesn't have a license.  Roland has never driven.  Wow.  No.  No.  I don't have a driver's license.  Odd thing.  God, that's so weird. 
[00:14:00]  I gotta put...  You can not drive.  That's like a thing you gotta do when you're growing up.  I wanna drive.  He never drove.  He doesn't have a license.  Wow.  And he's, what, 30?  Somewhere around there?  Yeah.  Wow.  That's so weird.  Yeah.  We gotta get Roland in a car.  That would be hilarious.  Oh, man.  You think he would panic?  Just fucking get him in a car and make him drive and then video it.  It would be hilarious.  Well, you do know he's...  Just get him in a big parking lot.  You know he's blind, too, right?  Have we talked about this on the air?  Really?  Roland desperately...  Desperately needs classes. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  And not just reading classes.  Excuse me.  He can't see.  God damn it.  And for some reason, he will not take care of that.  Really?  Right?  His vision is horrendous.  I know.  Yeah, he won't go to the doctor.  He won't go to the doctor.  He won't...  His eyes are bad.  He won't even buy those cheap glasses just to read.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He won't do anything.  So...  He doesn't want to give up.  He doesn't want to admit it.  Can't even just like wearing his glasses, either, man.  A lot of people don't like, don't like...  I don't either.  They feel like once the dam breaks with that, you're finished.  Right.  Like, it's the last thing they hold on to is not getting glasses or eye corrector wear. 
[00:15:00]  So he doesn't drive and he can't really see.  That's why this would be perfect to throw him in a car and see what he does.  But I don't want to do that parking lot shit.  I want to really put him on the street.  Like on the road?  Yes.  What?  Fucking...  It could be a little...  Closed course.  It could be a dumb little...  No, man.  Like a retarded driver on closed course.  Do not attempt.  Real traffic.  Real traffic?  Yes.  That's fucking dangerous.  That's what I want to see.  I think it'd be fun to put cones up and have him do a little road course. 
[00:15:30]  Well, Lerock, good luck with the standby flight tomorrow morning.  That's not everything.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What?  What else is going on?  Let's see.  I'm lucky enough to get the 6 a.m. flight, right?  Uh-huh.  That's the first flight out.  That's the first flight out.  By 6.02 or something.  And I'll get into Chicago about 8.30 in the morning.  So I'll have to take a cab to the hotel, which I'm not guaranteed check-in. 
[00:16:00]  Early check-in.  Right.  No, you're not.  Right.  But at a certain point, I'll have to leave the hotel to go to the venue without having checked into the hotel.  So I'll have to bring my stuff unless the hotel can hold on to it for me.  They'll watch it for you.  I'm sure they can.  But they'll lose it for you.  Your valuables, sir.  Wow.  You're not going to have as much fun in Chicago as us.  No, because the way it's looking by the time.  You're going to be really tired and you're not going to have a hotel room.  By the time we actually go live, I'll have been up over 12 hours. 
[00:16:30]  And E-Roc does not like being awake.  Yeah.  No, he loves his sleepy time, E-Roc.  So that'll be fun.  Well.  I can't wait until tomorrow.  Who else is going early?  Just you and Troy?  Roland.  He's going.  And I think somebody else.  Damn, man.  You look getting fucked.  I can't wait to talk to him tomorrow.  Yeah.  Oh, he's just going to be a fucking waste.  And they are calling for thunderstorms tomorrow, I think. 
[00:17:00]  So that's, especially in the Midwest.  That's brutal on travel.  E-Roc, this is what you do.  Get up around 8.30 tomorrow.  Yeah.  Leave for the airport at 9.  You get on your flight.  Yep.  And then you tell these idiots, nope.  Couldn't get on those earlier flights, boss.  Absolutely what I would do.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I'm not getting up at 4 a.m. for anyone.  Okay.  For a maybe.  No, getting up.  They want you at the airport at 4 a.m., right?  Yeah.  They want me at the airport at 4 a.m. 
[00:17:30]  Getting up at 3 a.m.  Why would you be at the airport at 4 at the first flight 6?  I don't know.  It's just wasn't.  I guess because if you're really early, maybe you could be the first on the standby list.  But no one even, they don't even show up to the kiosk until like 5.30.  Nah, those people aren't there.  They're not going to hang out there waiting.  What do you think?  The place is a fucking ghost town.  So let me run a worst-case scenario.  Uh-huh.  As much as we beat you up, by the way, it's bullshit.  If I get there at 4 and I can't get on the standby at 6 and then I can't get on at 7, right? 
[00:18:00]  Maybe I can get on at 8, but say the weather's so bad the flight starts getting delayed, and because the weather gets really bad, there's nothing until later in the afternoon and I can't make the live show at all.  Oh.  There's nothing better, by the way, than watching him try to get on a flight today, right now.  That's what he's doing.  I know what he's doing.  Yeah.  I know what he's doing.  He's painting a picture that could happen.  Yeah, why couldn't you just fly out later today? 
[00:18:30]  I'm saying, why don't they switch me too, guys?  Apparently, I didn't ask, so I don't know.  Oh, you chose to get up at 3.30 in the morning.  He was a little envious during the after show yesterday.  I bet.  About what happened.  Was he?  How some people got...  Well, he kept his mouth shut yesterday.  Yeah, the Thursday ticket.  Yeah, yesterday.  He had his own problems, but he decided not to pipe up.  Yeah, you fucking...  That's your fault.  Everyone's got choices to make.  During this intense discussion that it wasn't important about anything I was doing.  So, I just like, you know what?  Why bother? 
[00:19:00]  That's the attitude.  And my travel plans show.  That's the attitude.  I understand why bother, and it gets frustrating, but the bottom line is, you know, we know we  have to be there fucking for the show.  So, you can't accept same-day travel.  You can't do it.  I won't do it.  No.  I've had two...  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I've had two disastrous travel weeks in a row.  Seven hours to get up to Montreal.  And then last week, Troy pointed out to me, because we were so delayed because of a mechanical 
[00:19:30]  issue, that if we had to do this Sabbath interview today, I would have been out of my mind.  Panic.  Like, you never travel day up if you can help it.  You just get everyone pretty much on the same plane.  Stop with trying to save a few hundred bucks here and there.  Yeah.  Enough already.  It makes it stressful, man.  It makes it stressful.  These guys throw millions of dollars at nonsense radio shows, and then they try to save hundreds  of dollars.  Maybe $1,000.  Maybe $2,000, right? 
[00:20:00]  In the end, maybe.  I don't know if it'll be $2,000.  It wouldn't even be $2,000, because you're talking about just an extra night in Chicago.  Yeah.  You're just talking about an extra hotel night.  That's it.  Right.  Because you've got to fly, obviously.  And if you'd done it originally, it wouldn't have been more for the airfare.  Well, yeah.  Well, yeah.  If you do it ahead of time.  Right.  And most of these guys have had no money increases at all.  So it's like, if you give them an extra night in a hotel once in a while.  Like, I know that the company's thinking business.  I understand it's a business, and they're not out to be nice.  And that's all companies. 
[00:20:30]  But, hey, man.  It used to be...  It does kind of...  It goes a long way.  It used to be part of working for a company where they would just do the right thing for  the kind of time.  And they wouldn't expect a favor in return.  They just knew they would have a happier employee.  So, all right.  We'll get up to Chicago and broadcast live tomorrow.  We can't wait.  It'll be fun.  Marinette Park, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  115 Bourbon Street is the place.  I do think they're going to be a good crowd, because people have been twittering about  it, and I really do think we're going to have a good crowd.  I read one tweet. 
[00:21:00]  Yes.  I think it was this morning.  A guy wrote me, said that he's putting off his brain surgery so he could see us.  What?  I want to say, guy, just get your brain surgery.  What are you doing?  Jeepers.  Trust me.  We're great, but we're not that great.  No.  Yeah.  This guy...  I don't want to give his Twitter out just in case it was more of a private thing.  Where is it?  He said, yeah, I'm putting off my brain surgery so I can see you guys Friday.  That's pretty crazy. 
[00:21:30]  Somebody in management?  Fuckers.  No one's following that.  No, no, wait a minute.  Chip, you don't want to wait.  No, we just started.  We just started.  Chip, slow down.  What the fuck?  Slow down.  Show's going too long.  Slow down.  Too long.  Too long.  You know, I agree with you.  I hope they took me seriously yesterday when they said, I don't want those fuckers on stage 
[00:22:00]  or next to the stage.  You're reinforcing that?  I'm reinforcing it as much as possible because I really don't want to see him there.  We all have our things.  It ruins the whole fucking mood.  I didn't notice him as much as you did.  Oh, I had to look right at him.  It was terrible.  That's Anthony's thing.  We all have our thing.  Once I noticed him, I couldn't not look.  You need a good face.  Just a little...  You didn't like the disapproving look?  Oh, constant rolly eyes, smirky mouth, turny face.  Shaky head.  Shaky head. 
[00:22:30]  Fuck it.  Right.  I do remember I got a look because I was having an alcoholic beverage.  Yeah, that's another thing.  Don't get between me and my fucking booze.  And then I was trying to buy some alcoholic beverages for the other guys, and they said,  oh, God, they already told us we're not allowed to drink, and we'd be in deep trouble  if we had a drink.  Save it for off the air, guys.  I was trying to get between a lion and his gazelle.  Don't fucking get between me and my booze.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  I was just having a couple beverages.  The guys get beers. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  The guys get beers.  This kid.  So what do you want management if not on stage?  In the audience?  Or you want them in another room?  Hopefully in the fucking lake.  That'd be nice.  Who's going from that side?  Oh, yeah.  Are they coming in today or tomorrow?  Oh, they'd fly nice.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah.  What, are they there already?  They're not going to be inconvenienced.  They'll fly all nice.  You better they're on a private plane.  Like, they feel like they need to be there the day before a broadcast. 
[00:23:30]  They're the ones that should fly in last minute, because if they're not there, the broadcast  will sound exactly the same.  I don't even know what they do when they travel with us.  Oversee.  Oversee what?  I don't know it either.  Operations.  It's just the oddest thing.  How about they call our people and go, is everything all right up there?  Yep.  Trust us.  How many people are going?  Well, I know Gary is going today with us.  You're not that important, dope.  Oh, Jesus.  Why is he going today?  I don't know. 
[00:24:00]  How about he does the standby at 4 a.m.?  Oh.  Gives he a rocket seat.  That'd be a nice gesture.  Yeah.  Why is he going today?  You'd have to ask him.  I mean, I don't know.  What could he possibly be doing to make the broadcast better?  He's going to oversee the walkthrough of the venue.  Nice.  With the other guys?  What if he stands on stage and says, don't worry, Ant, I'm just here to make sure no other  management gets on stage?  No.  No.  I don't want any management on stage. 
[00:24:30]  It's a bummer.  Travis and Danny could easily do a walkthrough, and I would feel very comfortable with what  they notice and have to say about the walkthrough.  Reuben Kincaid never stood there while the Partridge family fucking played on stage with  him.  Right.  No, he was always out and, you know, maybe a side stage, off in the wings where they  couldn't see him.  You just gave him a promotion.  Yeah.  You're saying Gary is a Reuben Kincaid?  No, he's not even Reuben Kincaid.  He's more of a roadie.  He's like the fucking, yeah.  He's more of a roadie.  He should be lifting a lot of heavy shit for us. 
[00:25:00]  He's the tambourine tech.  He couldn't just give him Reuben Kincaid.  No.  Reuben Kincaid made a lot of things happen for the Partridge family.  He did.  He was a mover and a shaker, that guy.  He knew how to get things done.  He sure did.  Reuben Kincaid.  Who else is going?  Danny.  I think that Steve is going, I don't know when.  Bladder?  I think he is.  What?  I think.  He's the one that folds his arms a lot when we're broadcasting live, right?  He has a weird kind of, like, it's a casual yet sporty jacket he wears. 
[00:25:30]  He wears a weird jacket.  And he's just kind of, people can't see the face I'm making, but he's very bladder-like.  It's very, I want to think he's a fan of the show.  I'm not really sure still.  I don't know.  I'm not really sure.  Absolutely not.  Ab, so I would bet fucking every penny I have that he is not even near a fan of this program. 
[00:26:00]  Does not like what we do.  Does not understand what we do.  Just doesn't fucking get it at all.  Doesn't even know why we're here.  You're, you're, you're not, you're not wrong.  But he's a, but, but he's a weird ally.  Like, he's been a really good ally for us.  Like, he really does stick up for us.  And fucking, when I was having a situation, bladder was the one guy who really went to  bad for me.  Well, you know what?  It's because he's supposed to.  But he doesn't like the show. 
[00:26:30]  What kind of show does he like, you think?  Oh, God.  Morning Mashup, probably.  Really?  Probably loves a show like the Morning Mashup.  I'm going to give him a little more credit than that.  What?  I think he's in between the Morning Mashup.  Bieber's that small?  Well, that's an old five from that picture of bladder on his lap.  Oh, he scared me.  He's got the Bieber.  Bladder's carrying him to a bedroom.  It's a freaking picture.  Yeah, we're seeing a picture of Steve Bladder, Justin Bieber, and two guys I don't know.  Ryan from the Morning Mashup.  Oh, that guy.  Two guys I don't know. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know him.  Who's the other guy?  It's Kid Kelly.  Oh, boy.  The legendary Kid Kelly.  Is he famous?  Yeah, he's famous.  Okay.  Sorry, Kid Kelly.  He works here, too.  Oh, he works here.  He's in charge of hits one.  Oh, I thought he brought Bieber by or something.  No, no.  Oh, no.  Bladder would like the stuff on the show that we hate.  Like, literally, if we just ran out of material and just talked about coffee for 25 minutes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, waiting for a guest or something.  He'd be like, the next day, like, that coffee discussion was good.  Like, if we did every, let's say every Wednesday, we did a benchmark bit at 9 a.m. 
[00:27:30]  He'd love something like that.  Oh, would he love it?  So, you think he's a morning zoo guy?  Q with a D.  He would like all that.  Fucking trivia.  Yeah.  A phoner contest.  He would fucking love it.  But we sit here and talk about fucking Jim's insatiable taste for common cock.  We, uh, it's a problem.  But where the fucking...  So Chippy don't play that.  Oh, jeez, Chippy. 
[00:28:00]  So stupid.  Oh, my God.  That's sad.  It is, but that's just the way it is, and I don't think that'll ever change.  No.  I don't know.  Hence the faces.  I think he worries about getting in trouble.  Like, I think Bladder...  We can't possibly do anything with these restrictions to get in trouble anymore.  But Bladder likes a nice, quiet operation.  Like, he doesn't mind us going off the cuff.  If we were just riffing about oranges...  He would probably love a good orange riff. 
[00:28:30]  Like, just joking about the rinds and...  Hey, let's take some calls.  Who likes it with pulp?  Do you peel it or do you quarter it?  Your calls.  But don't you think going through life without turmoil is kind of boring?  Yeah.  It's boring.  It certainly is.  Even when we had a lot to lose, we loved the turmoil around us.  Yeah.  We have not much to lose these days.  Why would you want to go through life with everything just being kind of bland?  Because it's a good way to just keep your job.  You come in. 
[00:29:00]  You punch your time card.  And you leave.  Oh, I really hate that.  Well, you know what?  When you're on our end, it's kind of fun because, you know, we're in it.  Yeah.  When you're on their end, it's somebody else fucking up your job.  You know?  Have we fucked up people's jobs over the years?  Yes!  We have?  Fuck yes.  Shit.  Who?  Ken Stevens.  All right.  All right.  Jeremy Coleman.  All right.  Two guys.  Eric Nagel.  Jim Norton.  A few other staff members.  Uh-huh. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Who else went?  All right.  The great fucking purge.  The great war.  The great war.  John Manali.  Oh, Jesus.  Ugh.  Why did you say ugh?  I don't know.  He liked you.  Yeah, well.  He hated me.  He liked you.  And then that fucking Tracy.  God, she was terrible.  Yeah, I didn't care for her.  I liked her very much at all.  That was very nice.  You know what my favorite Tracy moment ever was?  When she was sitting on the couch while you guys were on the air waiting for you guys 
[00:30:00]  to finish, and she yawned, and Opie just laid in.  You were for yawning while he was sitting there.  She was sitting right across from me.  That's great.  Yeah, she was so distracting, man.  It's true.  We were trying to do a radio show, and she would come in studio to hide.  Yeah.  He rocked?  There was one time she was in there for something, and she was leaving, and Jim said her best  exit is just, you see her walk to the door, and then clothes just fall to the floor as  rats go running out the door.  Oh, yeah.  I did call her.  I called her. 
[00:30:30]  Yes, sir.  That's right.  The clothes fall, and rats just squeak and run away.  Yes, I did give her a good Dracula reference.  She transforms into rats.  To her credit, she did invite me to, I guess, a nude beach she hangs out at.  Wow.  To her credit, that's just gossip.  It's not gossip.  Jiminy Cricket.  She told me where she would sunbathe, and she said, I may, at times, sunbathe topless  with my friends, and if you're not doing anything, you could come by and say hi. 
[00:31:00]  What a non...  What do you mean that's gossip?  I think I still have the email.  She was an absolute non-my type.  Ever.  God, I didn't like her at all.  You didn't kind of have a thing for her.  There was some kind of sexual thing between you.  There was nothing.  I had a sexual thing for her.  Jimmy liked her somehow, but...  She didn't wear bras.  Oh, God.  Dude, that turns me...  She turned me on.  She didn't wear bras.  She, uh...  I didn't mind her.  She wasn't around long enough for me to really hate her.  There was just something about her.  I didn't mind her.  She really, really liked our show. 
[00:31:30]  How old is that fucking picture?  She wouldn't give us that day part during the day, though.  That made me dislike her and Tom Chiasano, because they wouldn't give us afternoon drive  for the homeless shopping spree.  And she's like, I'm not giving up my day part.  And Tom, who just didn't want the risk, wouldn't back us up.  He goes, oh, she's the PD.  Yeah, it's too bad, because that was a huge event, and we did very well with that, actually.  Yeah, but they just didn't want to do it.  How did we do that again?  I forgot.  Oh, we did it on XM, I guess?  I think we did.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Just fixing my chair.  Oh.  I thought you were leaving.  No.  What's the matter?  You've got to pull the chair out.  Oh, sometimes a little semen leaks out, and I get from the seat part.  I hope Tracy's doing well.  Yeah, I don't hate her.  I don't care.  I hope she's doing well.  Hey, go for her.  Chiasano wrote, I guess he listens to the show, because he said that the restaurant that  I went with Sam to and his lovely wife, where was that again?  Modern Pizza.  He says that's his favorite restaurant.  One of my friends texted me and said, Chiasano used to be in there literally twice a week. 
[00:32:30]  There's a stupid fucking pizza place up there in shit.  Chiasano told me he's there two to three times a week.  He's not exaggerating.  I saw him in New York City one time.  He's a guy with money.  Like, this place is like, it's not a hole in the wall.  The food's really good, but it's not like, you know, a fancy restaurant.  It's just a nice little family place.  He lives in Palomino's.  Westchester does shit.  Yeah, huh?  What's he doing?  He's retired now, just kind of consulting and relaxing?  Yeah, he says hi to everyone.  There's dumb birds. 
[00:33:00]  He had a big bird collection, I remember.  Birds?  Yeah, Tom was a big guy.  He loved birds, man.  Like parrots and shit?  Yeah, yeah.  He had a big collection.  We used to tease him for it.  With his awful ties and his bird collection.  He was a weird bird guy.  Remember when we went to the country club?  He meant well.  I liked him.  I know.  Because Tom hated us when we were in his competition.  And then he really, I'll give you the, I'll say this.  He really embraced us and what we did, but he was still management and all that.  That's where we kind of, you know, clashed or whatever.  But he absolutely embraced us after being a horrible competition. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  When he was kind of like overseeing the whole Howard thing.  But he had an open mind when we came aboard and he believed in us.  He really did in the end.  Because he believed in us.  I like Tom.  Yeah, he was a good egg.  See, Sam?  A couple people I like.  I liked him.  Until I found he was one of the guys gunning for me.  Then I stopped liking him.  Was he gunning for you?  Maybe not as hard as he could have been, but I didn't love him because of that. 
[00:34:00]  Remember his fascination with the, we need more sound effects on the show.  Oh, God.  Who did he talk about?  The guy that did that awful.  It was probably brilliant when he did it.  Who did the sound effects and convinced everybody that they were making a lake into like a cherry float.  Yes.  He loved them.  What?  There's a famous, I guess, Foley work thing where a guy makes a lake sound like a cherry float.  Like he convinced people that the helicopter is dropping in a giant cherry.  And can you look it up on YouTube, Sam?  It might be.  Oh, boy.  It's a pretty well-known bit of Foley work. 
[00:34:30]  And he was saying an example of what you can do with sound effects.  Tom was like a little old school like that.  So he must have loved Fred Norris.  Fred does all the effects for Howard, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's fucking, that's funny.  We do all right.  We don't use many of them, but it's a different show.  It's a different show.  And then Tracy once pulled me aside and said that perhaps we should do a break on that  fucking, remember that show with those little animals, the what family, the, um, the meerkat? 
[00:35:00]  Meerkat.  Meerkat Manor.  Was that the name of the show?  I think that's right.  She's like, I watch, you ought to do a break on that because it's so, and she was serious.  And I'm like, I'm thinking in my head, there's no fucking way to talk about that show.  What the hell is she insane?  Meerkat Manor.  They are adorable.  I will say that much.  This was an actual show?  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, you know, one of those fucking animal reality shows.  I don't know. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  Oh God, the things I used to have to smile and nod at.  Fuck me running.  Tracy was also big on sound effects and she once brought the staff into a meeting.  Specifically, I think it was either E-Rock or Danny, whoever was sitting in studio at the time.  Oh, because Tom got on her about it.  Probably.  And said that, uh, like when we were doing the boiled meat barbecue, we should have had  animal sounds for whatever animal we were eating.  Right.  Great idea.  Like oink oink sounds.  Oh.  Hey, look, you're going to have some pork.  Oink.  Oink.  Oink.  Who fucking enjoys that shit? 
[00:36:00]  No one.  No one.  Is Troy, uh, is his voice better today?  It was worse than ever yesterday.  I was driving home yesterday listening to, uh, Sam Roberts and the, uh, after show.  Yes.  And, uh, Troy was on the air and his voice is horrible.  Like, gone.  Mm-hmm.  And, and, uh, I wanted to say, dude, he can't sing like that anymore.  Well, there's a theory that he was singing with his band.  Travis brought it first to my attention that Troy is simply not aware of the fact that he's 
[00:36:30]  too old to be singing like that.  That's it.  I mean.  Oh, boy.  Look, he could come in and do those screams and stuff into the mic once or twice during  our show or something like that.  But to pull off an entire fucking, like, gig or a practice with your band, getting some  shit together and running through songs over and over and singing like that, he can't do  it anymore.  That's bad for your throat, man.  It's so bad.  Where is he?  Here he is.  Here he comes.  And he's, he's fucking like, his voice was completely gone. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, he, I, I did Bonio with him.  There he is.  What happened to your voice?  Oh, how's your voice?  Let's hear it.  Get that mic, pot him up, and let's hear.  It's doing better, actually.  Oh.  I'm not sure.  It's, it's doing better.  I'll be okay by tomorrow, I think.  You did a great, uh, Uncle Paul, or Edgar yesterday.  Edgar, yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, you sang with your band?  Well, I'm starting a new band.  I'm doing, I'm working on a new project.  But are you doing that same, what's it called, death metal, or what's it?  Uh, just like screaming.  Screaming.  Just like screaming.  What's the genre, though?  I don't know.  Well, I mean, the band that I'm doing is completely different and weird, so, but it's like grindcore, 
[00:37:30]  hardcore.  But that's gonna kill your voice, dude.  Yeah, I just gotta build it back up.  How do you build it back up?  What, polyps?  Well, you just gotta let this happen.  You gotta let this happen.  You gotta let it heal.  You gotta do it again.  You gotta let it heal.  It heals with scar tissue.  Yeah.  But that's why you get, like, a nice, like, raspy, like, oh my God.  You ever hear of those guys that have, like, really good, real deep voices?  They just sit there and fucking smoke?  Well, I like to think I'm one of those guys.  Jesus.  Yeah, Jack Klugman.  Yeah, but Brian Johnson, Lemmy, a couple guys that have fucking got the kind of really 
[00:38:00]  gravelly Scorch.  Hey, Scorch!  We gotta check in with Scorch soon.  Yesterday, you sounded horrendous.  That was awful.  I couldn't even talk.  You know what?  Roland saved the day.  What?  Roland has a drink.  He's like, oh, go here and get this drink called Warrior.  How does he know everything?  I don't know.  He's like a fucking, what do they call those people that know?  Asshole.  A creep.  Oh, pederast.  A busy buddy.  Oh, man. 
[00:38:30]  What was in it?  I don't even know.  Everybody was telling me everything.  Everybody was like, oh, get cicadas and put it into a tea and all this crazy shit.  And then he's like, just go get this drink.  And I literally drank two of them.  And all of a sudden, my voice came back.  Was it from Juice Generations?  Yes.  Yeah, I know the drink, actually.  Yeah.  I think it was ginger and ginger.  Juice Generations.  Yeah, and it's actually pretty good.  Juice.  Oh, that's different.  You should eat powdered milk.  Shut up.  Oh, don't poke him like that.  Powder.  Eat powdered milk.  Oh, my God. 
[00:39:00]  I fucking love Edgar.  Edgar's the man.  Oh, you do like Edgar.  I love Edgar.  Troy was saying, Edgar.  He had some trouble, though, when he was traveling with Jim, keeping up with all the characters  and maintaining a conversation.  It's very difficult.  I've had Jim over my house where it's just us two.  And all of a sudden, you know, I have to talk to Chip or Edgar.  Troy said it was to the point where Jim would start the thought and then Chip would finish  it.  And he'd be like, I'm trying to keep up with you.  Yeah, we're just hanging out.  We're just hanging out.  It's very odd. 
[00:39:30]  It's fun, though.  We had a good time.  Yes, we did.  Did you guys see the homoerotic picture that we took?  Which one?  Oh, yeah.  That was a guy from Getty Snap that shot.  Oh, you guys are on, like...  Gas station?  Oh.  I'm an idiot.  But it's, yeah, it's just a couple of cool guys hanging out.  This guy's a huge fan of the show.  There it is.  Ah.  Just a couple of fucking...  Oh, wow.  Does that look like...  You are such a bottom in that picture, Jimmy.  Well, he's just taller.  Yeah, well...  Doesn't make me necessarily the cock taker. 
[00:40:00]  You're a little more femmy.  Well, I kind of just did it on purpose.  No tats?  No.  I'm the softer of the two.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy's a huge fan of the show.  He was very cool.  Well, tell him we said hey.  He was...  He came over.  He was freaking out.  He's like, what's up, Jim?  Are you going to do that standby shit tomorrow?  I mean, when I get there, I get there.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I don't blame you.  I mean, it's just fucking...  We're not going to be pissed.  Just roll with it, right?  We're not going to be pissed.  I'm going out to Chicago to have a good time.  So...  Good time. 
[00:40:30]  When I get there, I get there.  I love the way he thinks.  I mean, it's not going out to Chicago.  But why can't E-Rock have this attitude?  I love it.  Because, I mean, I don't blame either one of these guys if they don't make the broadcast  because of what they did down the hall.  Were you going for the broadcast?  You haven't gone for...  Just to have a good time?  I'm going for the broadcast.  But if something prevents me from getting there on time, I'm sorry, guys.  I completely understand.  I mean, why would you ever do that?  Because they were like, you're going to have to go right from the airport to the venue.  Right.  Why would they do that to anybody?  You're right. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, that's not fun.  That's bullshit.  That's making it more of a job.  We have very easy jobs.  So I'm hoping to be there.  What's your line that you used in Cleveland about, you know, just having fun, good time?  Down for whatever?  Down for whatever.  Down for whatever.  That's it.  He's down for whatever.  I'm going out there.  Same attitude.  Down for whatever.  Yeah, as soon as the broadcast is over, I'm on vacation.  Can we get down for whatever t-shirts?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And he would look at me when we were in Cleveland and Roland, when Roland didn't want to go  to the strip club at first, and he'd be like, if you didn't come to Cleveland to party, 
[00:41:30]  then what did you come for?  Yeah.  And so now I think the same attitude is to be like, well, if you're not in Chicago to  party, then why are you here?  Why the fuck are you even here?  Why are you wasting our time?  And in Cleveland, it was great.  After the show, everybody was like, oh, this is going on here.  This is going on.  Yeah.  So it's like, fuck, let's have a good time.  Casino now, we're going to be at.  I was getting some tweets last night from people.  Hey, can the general population join you in blackjack?  Well, you know what?  If you can keep up, motherfuckers. 
[00:42:00]  Whoa.  If you can keep up, you can sit your ass down.  You fuck up once, you're gone.  Wow.  And don't fucking pussy out on me and sit there and fucking nickel and dime it, because you're  not going to make smart decisions.  Thank you.  So you're hitting the casino?  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  I will be playing some A Black A Jack.  Cool.  And a lot of people, you know, there's been quite a few inquiries with this Chicago trip.  I think it's going to be all right. 
[00:42:30]  I really do.  And a lot of people, with their stupid fucking food suggestions, I can't eat this much food  in a month.  I love it, though.  It's so funny.  It's like, dude, you go to Chicago, you got to go to fucking...  I think I got to hit 10 restaurants.  Yeah, I know.  Everybody's got their idea.  There's a steak place, a pizza place.  There was a sushi recommendation.  Every type of food, every place you got to go.  How am I going to fit all this in?  Dude, it's fucking right.  It's two steps out of your hotel door.  It's across the river.  The river.  I saw that one last night.  It's across the river.  It's across the river.  You got to go.  It's two blocks from where you're staying. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  I can't wait.  I've never been to Chicago.  I can't believe it.  It's a beautiful city.  Yeah.  We were walking around last week.  We just couldn't believe how clean it was, how nice it is.  Anthony can't make the rules at a casino table.  Oh, you stupid.  I do make the rules, motherfucker.  I get my own table.  Come on.  Say it.  Say it.  What?  Block.  Nah, leave him alone.  He just doesn't know better.  He's lucky.  He's just a lowly piece of shit that doesn't know what it's like to be a whale. 
[00:43:30]  Sorry, Iraq.  Matt.  Not like that.  But he was minding his own business.  Well, he should have minding his own fucking business.  No, I mean Iraq.  Why not?  Iraq was just minding his own business.  Poor guy.  He's going to be minding his own business for hours at the airport.  And then at the fucking, in the lobby of the hotel.  And Iraq is just a good guy.  So he will be there at four.  You know, you might not make it at four on the dot.  I'm not going to be there for.  I love it.  I love this.  How would I do that? 
[00:44:00]  Troy rolls.  Get on a plane.  But Iraq's all about doing what he's told.  He'll be there.  Yes, sir.  Iraq is the good soldier.  He really is.  And for some reason we beat him up for it.  Sometimes he thinks he's badass.  Ooh.  Sometimes he'll do stuff.  He'll be like.  Iraq, when do you feel like you're a badass?  I guess whenever Troy decides to point this out.  Troy's Sergeant Barnes and you're a fucking Gardner.  You're just a good little soldier that's going to get picked off.  And Barnes just walking around.  When does he feel like he's a badass?  I'm not going down this road. 
[00:44:30]  No, he's asking you a question.  No, that's fair.  Eric and I have been good lately.  And I, you know.  You want to keep it that way?  It was my New Year's resolution.  But you brought it up.  And then Opie asked you the question.  And it is Opie's, you know, his name is on the wall.  So if you could answer, that'd be cool.  It's the only thing.  Do I have to?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because I never know what's coming out of your stupid mouth.  Oh, damn.  Troy's brutal, man.  I will acknowledge you could be brutal.  I don't fucking care.  You know what I mean?  Just like... 
[00:45:00]  E-Rock, would you like him to say?  He should say.  E-Rock?  Oh, E-Rock's thinking.  Oh, I'm not going to say it, E-Rock.  It's fine.  We're doing good.  And we're on our way to Chicago.  We're going to have a good time.  Sure.  Chicago.  I've just never seen E-Rock act like a badass.  Yeah, what did he do that was badass?  I am curious.  He does without that pesky bad part.  Or just without the ass.  It's a bad employee.  Hey, we got...  Poor E-Rock.  We got CM Punk coming by and... 
[00:45:30]  What?  Maybe.  What?  Oh, is that a secret?  No.  It's possible.  We tried him yesterday.  Huh?  I saw you tweeted him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's still bugging him.  Leave him alone.  I thought he was bugging him.  He was tweeting back to me, too.  He was being polite.  It was a conversation.  I thought he was booked already.  We're working on him.  I don't even know if he knows when he's going to be in Chicago.  Right.  I hear Huey Lewis might stop by and say hi.  Possibly.  Oh, he's a possibility, too?  Yeah, I don't know if...  Well, we don't need Huey Lewis.  No.  It would just be kind of cool to say, hey, Huey Lewis, and, you know, talk to him for four 
[00:46:00]  minutes and tell him to get the fuck out.  Yeah, his giant penis.  Enjoy a more deep dish pizza.  I just want to know what Troy was talking about.  Oh, by the way, those meatballs yesterday?  Holy fuck.  Who else had them?  Dude, I had a half a turkey meatball.  It didn't bother my reflux.  It was fucking amazing.  I had four.  I had four, too.  You had four?  Wow.  Were they good?  I didn't have any.  Not only was the meatballs amazing, their sauce was ridiculous. 
[00:46:30]  I didn't eat pasta.  I had the meatballs, the sauce, and then I was dipping the bread.  They do?  Are they have pasta, too?  Sounds great.  I don't know, but I would assume that's what would put the whole thing together.  Fuck, were they good?  But the sauce itself was amazing.  They're not a sponsor.  I'm just...  Right, not at all.  But who gives a fuck?  I brought home a shitload of meatballs.  I had two turkey meatballs, and then I went with the pork.  They were basically sausage meatballs.  Amazing.  They were amazing.  What's the name of the place?  We'll plug it, because it was great.  I don't remember.  Meatball Explosion. 
[00:47:00]  I bet.  Damn, what's that good?  Meatball Explosion.  That sounds like a violent name.  I don't think it was Meatball Explosion.  What happens when you're riding your bike and you slip off?  Are you sure?  I think it's that place that's in...  I was going to say that's what happened to Apollonia.  Roland's going to kill you.  I don't think it's Meatball Explosion.  I heard a dumb-looking...  Look up...  Sausage, pork, turkey.  Apollonia, no!  Meatball's 6th Avenue and 14th Street.  I think it's that place.  6th Avenue and 14th Street. 
[00:47:30]  I don't want to plug a bad meatball place.  Meatball Obsession.  It was?  Wait, what did you say?  Explosion.  Okay, Meatball Obsession.  That's a little different.  For the New Yorkers, man.  Meatball Obsession.  And it's right on 14th and 6th Avenue.  Really good.  Yeah.  I'm not a big meatball guy in general.  I'd rather have a nice meat sauce.  I like a good meatball.  You do?  Sure.  They're pretty goddamn good.  I rediscovered sausage.  Yeah? 
[00:48:00]  And spaghetti.  Yeah?  Holy...  It is pretty goddamn good.  Nothing better than a fucking nice saucepan fucking cooking for hours with the pork in there  and the meal all falls apart when you eat the old model.  Yeah.  That is good shit, though.  Yeah.  So the details for the Chicago trip.  Could you just play the promo and make it easy for everybody, Yorick?  Oh.  All right.  I hope a lot of people show up.  We're very excited about this trip.  It is 115 Bourbon Street, and it's 2 o'clock doors open Chicago time. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, 2 o'clock doors are open Chicago time.  Chicago.  And I don't...  We could be there for a while.  At what time are we starting?  I think we're starting around 3, but if we got a lot of stuff, we're going to continue  the broadcast, and then after the broadcast, I'm sure we're hanging.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Because I know there's a bunch of people that want to go, but they can't get out of work  and all that, so, you know, stop by after work.  We should be there for a while.  The cease.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, you can catch on Twitter and whatever.  We'll let you know what we're doing.  We should all tweet this thing.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:49:00]  And Yorick will try to be there on time, and Troy doesn't give a fuck?  I'll be there.  I don't know when I'll be there.  But you guys will see me in Chicago.  And you have every right to say that.  Yeah.  I mean, that's the flight they booked me for.  Right.  That's it.  To go to an airport at 4.30 and be on standby, that's crazy.  Yeah.  Can I plug something?  Yeah.  Jim's Black Sabbath interview is going to air tonight on Ozzy's Boneyard.  Oh.  Thank you.  Well, ain't I just a shit. 
[00:49:30]  That's a pretty good point.  Are we bringing any of that over here to this channel?  Yeah, whenever you guys want.  We have the interview.  What time is it airing?  I believe it's during your show.  Oh, good.  Okay, I'll tape it.  I'll find out the details.  Thank God.  Okay.  Take us to play some advertisements.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. 
[00:50:00]  People have picked up on the fact that E-Rock was bitching that he could possibly be awake  for 12 hours.  Wow.  E-Rock fucking hours?  E-Rock, this is not me.  Sanity.  Huh?  A lot of people picked up on that.  We did it.  When E-Rock said, you know, by the time I get to the venue, I'm going to be up for 12 hours.  Why is that?  It's just such an insane thing to say. 
[00:50:30]  I'm up for 12 hours every single day of my life.  Oh, man.  And that's not a brag.  Most people, you'd say, like.  Most people are 16 or 17 hours a day.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah, I mean, that's.  And that's conservatively.  Right, because you go, okay, you sleep for eight hours, right?  Yeah, most people don't sleep eight hours these days.  Even if you do get a full eight hours sleep.  Right, that would be 16 hours.  That leaves you with a 16-hour day to fill.  And no one sleeps eight hours, yeah.  And E-Rock is bitching because he might be waiting for 12 hours. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, 12 hours.  E-Rock gets his eight hours of sleep, and then he takes naps every three hours.  He needs to get his 12 hours of sleep.  E-Rock, what's that about?  No, it's shitty travel, and then dicking around Chicago before we even start the show.  Whoa!  This is the E-Rock I love, by the way, right here.  It's after-show E-Rock right there.  I'm aware people stay up for 12 hours.  Why don't you come back here and shut up?  But they don't stay up 12 hours before they start work?  Oh, so his point is, just imagine being up for 12 hours before you start your work day. 
[00:51:30]  But our work day is only, what, two hours, maybe three hours?  Plus, isn't that half of Ant's work days?  Plus shitty traveling.  Shitty traveling.  I think the travel thing is really starting to get to them.  That's what we're doing today.  You know, people would fucking, there are some people that would love to be traveling to Chicago.  And you're making it sound like it's a chore.  They can wait at 4 a.m. at the airport.  Is the 4 a.m. thing starting to get to you, E-Rock?  I'm not fucking doing that.  Oh!  He is.  You know he will.  He totally is.  He's so well. 
[00:52:00]  He's trying to quant out right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Quant it out, huh?  But he'll just end up nagling the whole thing.  Oh!  He's going to nagle it.  Do you think he's going to do it?  Of course he is.  He'll be there a quarter to five.  And as soon as he gets to the airport, he'll text management, I'm here, boss.  I'm here waiting now.  Yeah.  Just like you told me to.  Here's what this weasel will do.  He'll Twitter a picture of himself from the airport at like 4.30.  Rise and shine.  Let me tell you something, Eric.  The clock will just happen to be in the background.  So he gets brownie points for getting there at 4.30.  I've talked with Troy Kwan. 
[00:52:30]  I've worked with Troy Kwan.  I know Troy Kwan.  You, my friend, know Troy Kwan.  Oh, no.  Jimmy, we picked up on the fact that E-Rock was bitching that he might be awake for 12  straight hours.  That really is.  Yeah, that kind of, by the time you go on the air, I know what you're saying, but that's  not this.  Who cares, really?  That's not that bad, E-Rock.  That's not a long time to be awake.  Yeah, I thought what he said, I might be awake.  My first all is like two days or a day or 20 hours.  I think Anthony's record is 36 hours he's been awake and then does the radio show. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, that was a good one.  Yeah.  That was after fucking deep dicking.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fucking Anthony Longstroke.  Oh, please.  What was it?  Wait a minute.  Anyway.  Yeah.  E-Rock will be there.  What are you doing?  E-Rock will be there.  The people want to see E-Rock.  Yeah, they do.  They do.  I know.  And he's judging the worst breath contest, which is worth 500 bucks.  I forgot.  You know what?  You're right.  Eww.  What is that?  What do you mean?  Oh, God.  Oh, no. 
[00:53:30]  Eww.  What's up, R-Rock?  Oh, God.  He's trying to be sexy.  No.  He's trying to take a picture of his shirt that keeps turning blue.  No.  No.  You got your bedroom eyes on.  Oh, get that sexy face.  You're trying to be sexy in your face.  Eww.  You're not taking a picture of your blue shirt, plausible guy.  E-Rock is all hideous in your photos.  You got a shit on mine.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  That was a low blow.  Tear us down because we caught you being your sexy motherfucker. 
[00:54:00]  You're trying to be sexy.  Come on.  Yeah.  That is a sexy look.  That's a sexy look.  E-Rock knows that's a sexy look.  E-Rock knows that's a sexy look.  That's someone trying very hard right there.  That's an awesome photo.  That's the face the girl gets if he leans up against her on a wall in a club.  Yes.  What's up, Eric?  How many look exactly like that, just a little different?  You didn't like them?  There's three.  Let's see the other ones.  Ah, fuck.  Remember his Paris Hilton photo?  Oh, my God.  I just was thinking of that. 
[00:54:30]  With his dreamy eyes.  Dreamy.  E-Rock could get his eyes all dreamy.  He's like, hey, Facebook.  What's going on?  I don't think this picture is having the effect he wanted on the girls.  Well, based on the girls that have seen it and told me they don't like it.  Oh, shit.  Is that his profile picture on Facebook?  Yes.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Oh, no.  Like Nicole from the Morning Mashup.  Dude, why would you put that picture as your profile pic?  That is what you put if you're trying to get laid.  Why wouldn't I?  But that's what you put if you're trying to get laid. 
[00:55:00]  You're like, ah, I'll put my sexy look.  Well, you do want to look good if you're throwing your picture up.  He's got some MySpace voodoo going on, too.  I was told I don't smile in any of my photos, so that's a pensive, sexy look.  Like, I know what I've got in store for you, sweetie.  E-Rock, just fess up, man.  You fucking die.  That's on purpose.  You think you want to look sexy?  No, shit.  I took it myself.  Yeah, but you're looking sexy.  You fucking did something.  You made a look to try to look sexy.  Well, there's also some chins I'm trying to hide.  Oh, there you go.  Well, I don't know if you heard Travis, but Travis said there is some voodoo going on. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  We used to call it MySpace voodoo, but now it's Facebook voodoo, where these girls will  take it from an angle to make themselves look a little thinner.  And Travis has pointed out you might be doing that, sir.  I was just hoping.  Well, thanks for visiting my Facebook page.  What is your Facebook page?  That's fucking hilarious.  Boom.  No.  What's your Facebook page?  It's fine.  It's fine.  He keeps it private, anyway.  Oh, you do? 
[00:56:00]  What?  Oh.  Why?  Just for fucking bitches and studs.  Family house.  Yeah.  How old is that photo?  A couple days.  Tuesday.  Wow.  Really?  That's you now?  I would have said that's five years ago.  I swear to God.  Me, too.  That's voodoo.  He's using the voodoo.  Yeah.  What do you do to make yourself look fresh?  I smile.  And healthy.  What are you throwing it through the fucking Howard Stern filter?  Jesus.  Did you see that picture last night?  That was hilarious.  Did he get a facelift?  No.  He got a photoshopping. 
[00:56:30]  Really?  That fucking picture was so photoshopped.  And it was obvious because Beth had photoshopped or had tweeted the same picture.  But didn't photoshop it.  I didn't notice this.  Roland just texted me a picture I want to show you guys.  Oh, no.  And he said, this is my sexy look.  Oh, no.  Roland's kind of looking up at the camera, right?  Oh, God.  That's fucking bizarre.  Wow. 
[00:57:00]  Jesus, Roland.  A lot of people were tweeting that picture.  What?  They were wishing Robin a happy birthday or something?  Yeah, yeah.  So they were both together in the picture and holding a sign up.  And, yeah, that's a picture of him now.  But then the other picture that's in that is...  Oh, what happened?  Why aren't there no links?  Oh, boy.  Find a motherfucking link.  Then there's that one.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, come on.  That's a plastic face.  It's photoshopped.  Is it? 
[00:57:30]  Totally.  Because then she tweeted it, and, like, he's got his Adam's apple and everything.  It's so airbrushed.  And, look, the shirt is...  Oh, yeah, there's no Adam's apple.  Look, that's him.  Yeah.  And then the other picture is photoshopped.  Where's the un-photoshopped?  Really weird.  Yeah, look.  See the Adam's apple on that one?  But even that one's not Bailey.  Why would you...  But, well, she did do some photoshopping to it.  She just didn't do it to the extent that he did with the... 
[00:58:00]  I guess he doesn't like his Adam's apple.  With the Adam's apple.  Because his version, he got rid of that fucking Adam's apple.  But she also did some photoshopping before they put that one out there.  Look at that.  Is that a thing for guys with a big Adam's apple?  Like, it's embarrassing or uncomfortable?  Eh.  I don't give a shit.  I don't know.  I'll ask my next fucking girlfriend.  I guess I don't have one.  I have fucking no Adam's apple.  You have no Adam's apple?  I have one, but you can't see it under my fucking pelican-like appendage. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, that's just pretty fucking Photoshop-y with the neck.  The neck is weird.  Why would he do that?  It's not even done well.  It looks very flat.  Yeah, it looks stupid.  Oh, no.  Whatever.  Yeah.  Good for him.  I just noticed that last night.  It's very Photoshop-ed.  Very Photoshop-ed.  E-Rock's staying up for 12 hours.  E-Rock's terrible Facebook trying to be sexy.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  With a little voodoo going on.  Oh, God. 
[00:59:00]  Now looking at it again, it's like, man.  It's nice, right?  The old rosy-cheeked.  Purple shirt-wearing.  Fuck.  Why are you trying to take sexy photos, though?  Yeah.  I don't get it.  You're a married guy.  I got a nice purple shirt, and I wanted to show up.  It's nothing about the shirt.  It's an old navy t-shirt.  It's nothing about the shirt.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not a nice purple shirt.  And if you wanted, you're making a sexy face.  That's not the shirt.  Yeah.  You're a married guy.  That's a profile pic of somebody that is trying to... 
[00:59:30]  You're not supposed to give up if you get married, though.  He wants to look good.  No, but that's like...  No.  You could look good.  You think this is more than looking good?  That's trying to get a girl's picture.  That's a trying to get girl's picture.  That's a trying to get chick's pic.  My family thought I looked very nice.  Oh, boy.  What are they going to say?  Yeah, really?  What are they going to say?  What are they going to say?  They said, it's good to see you smile.  That's a smile?  That's a smirk.  That's a sexy smile.  No, that's a sexy smile.  That's the bedroom eyes come... 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  That's a, I've got something in store for you in my underpants smile.  Yeah, I can't help you there, Yurok.  That's kind of a sexy...  That's not a smile.  Yeah, you know that look has gotten...  He's gotten some things done over the years.  And the first-person perspective view of you hugging somebody?  Well, if that's what you think of me, man.  With the two fucking arms.  What are you doing?  I was holding the phone up.  He's basically saying, come here!  Come here, you!  Come on!  Come here, you!  Come here!  Come here, you!  Come here!  Give me a hug! 
[01:00:30]  Poor Eric.  You watched the Olympics last night?  Oh, put on a...  They say, pull up his profile gallery.  It's Fifty Shades of Nagel.  There's his profile gallery.  Let's see.  There are a bunch of them.  Oh.  Oh, this is my...  Oh, that's a good one.  Yeah, what is that?  That's when he used to motorboat to high school.  Down in Florida.  Try to put a new American hairstyle.  Look, blonde, porcupine hair. 
[01:01:00]  Look like porcupine.  They call it the Eric Nickle.  He looks like the cook.  Who's that fucking celebrity chef?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Guy Fieri.  Guy Fieri, yeah.  He's doing...  Oh, no.  He's trying to show his baby blues off.  Yeah, yeah.  But look at his blonde hair poking out from underneath his hat.  Very, very on purpose.  Just enough?  Just showing just enough?  Just enough to let the girls know he's...  He's a blonde.  He's wearing a winter hat indoors. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, where were you when that was taken?  I've been known to do that.  Shut up.  His head has to be hot.  I've been known to do that, Sam.  Shut up.  Why?  I don't know.  There's no reason for that.  That's terrible.  Take your hat off as soon as you walk in.  Eric, what's your best feature, you think?  Oh, boy.  Not being in front of the camera.  No.  No.  You take pictures of yourself.  No, you like taking pictures of me.  What's your best feature?  Besides, you have very sturdy legs, obviously.  You want to...  Go ahead.  Just say it.  You see the other ones.  No, it's your eyes, right?  You want to say it.  Oh, okay.  Why not?  It's the other ones.  Well, it's obvious, because look at these pictures. 
[01:02:00]  Your eyes are like...  I'm dreamy.  That's intense, Eric.  And he's purposely showing, by the way...  Yeah, why is there a lipstick on the cheek?  Yeah, why is there a lipstick on the cheek?  Oh, God.  Why would you purposely show that he got lipstick on your cheek?  Because that was at a wedding, and that was from my wife.  You're so transparent.  It really is.  I'm sorry.  You're an easy fucking...  Bearing guns up there.  Oh!  Bearing guns.  Oh!  E-Rock!  Oh, shit.  Getting at me.  E-Rock's not playing today.  No, he's not. 
[01:02:30]  What's that hand up?  No pictures, please.  That's like, hey, I'm working here.  Oh, shit.  I'm busy.  Unless I take care of myself.  No, the caption is, put hoagie here.  Hoagie.  You think he's trying to catch a hero?  Yes, he is.  That was at the hero throwing contest.  He was on the receiving end.  The picture for the people out there is just a hand, but you can see E-Rock in the background.  It's on my Twitter.  School day?  Oh, that's a Twitter pic.  It's a fucking...  Is it a snow day from school?  What do you got there?  And he's doing the dreamy eyes again.  More dreamy eyes.  More dreamy eyes.  That's just mysterious.  Like, what is this? 
[01:03:00]  What's this devil-may-care guy up to in the snow?  Wow.  It's again, no reason for his hood to be up.  He's in the car.  Yeah, what are you doing?  It's fucking snow.  Is that snow or rain outside?  Snow.  All right, but you're indoors.  Put your fucking hood down.  You're trying to look innocent.  Yeah, he is.  He's trying very hard to look innocent in all his pictures.  Who's this devilish man-boy?  The wolf in sheep's clothing.  I'm adorable.  Oh, man.  How adorable.  He does think he is.  I know he does.  He's the wolf in hippo's clothing.  Oh, boy. 
[01:03:30]  Why is it E-Rog like?  I don't know.  Fuck, dude.  What's wrong with you?  I'm having fun.  I got a Cialis boner.  Because I'm wearing my...  Looking at that photo?  No, I'm wearing my...  That shows you how random they are.  I'm wearing my sweats for a flight.  Yeah.  And you got the Cialis boner?  Hey, dude, it's just awful.  What do you take those, like, fucking one-a-days?  No, it's from last week. 
[01:04:00]  It was three days ago.  Really?  It stays in your system that long?  I haven't been doing it.  Will you beat off, though?  Sure.  Doesn't that fucking do it?  Not much?  No?  Jesus Christ.  Those fucking boner drugs are weird.  They're the best.  Are they?  Sure.  You like them?  I never did a boner drug.  I never took a boner drug.  I don't have issues, but now I want to at least try it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And try it?  Why not?  Why not?  It'd kind of be fun, I guess.  Remember when they were trying to say that if you don't have any erectile dysfunction 
[01:04:30]  problems, Viagra won't do anything for you?  Remember they were trying to tell people that to get them to not take it unless you needed  it?  And I guess that was all bullshit, huh?  Dude.  It gives you a big fucking turgid rod.  I'm fucking tumescent all the time.  Tumescent.  Tumescent or bust.  It's a sign I hold on the fucking side of the road.  My penis pointing towards Albuquerque.  Anything about the Olympics last night? 
[01:05:00]  I saw they had more diving.  I thought we were done with the diving.  Yeah.  I didn't really watch the Olympics last night.  I saw the volleyball match with that carry or I think it's carry, right?  And Misty.  They won their third gold medal.  They did?  Three Olympics in a row.  I was rooting for them.  And you know what?  Remember yesterday I asked Sam when is the match because he wanted to watch it live?  Yeah.  This is really quick.  I forgot to watch it live.  So then I'm like, okay, I still don't know who won. 
[01:05:30]  I'll just watch it at 8 o'clock.  I'll turn down all the, you know, I'll turn off Twitter and everything.  I'm good.  Yeah, yeah.  And I went to a website because I was trying to look up something and NBC had an advertisement  on the side.  I don't even think it was an NBC website with all the highlights.  And it said, Curry and Misty do it again.  Five minutes before I was actually going to watch.  I made it to five minutes before.  And on NBC they blew it?  I don't remember.  I don't know what this website was because I don't think it was an NBC website because 
[01:06:00]  I was trying to avoid all that.  But it had like three or four things on the right side.  And it was like, what happened that day?  And then you click and you could, I guess, see the highlights of it.  Yeah, you just got to stay offline, dude.  Spurlers.  But I did well right up until it was time to watch the damn thing.  I was five minutes out.  That blows.  But that's how hard it is to, you know, avoid information nowadays.  Yep.  But I almost made it.  I saw that, though, because that was kind of cool.  They're all broads.  They don't really look good in their bikinis, but I was rooting for them.  No, there's plenty of other teams that look great. 
[01:06:30]  They play the younger American team where the one girl has potential but has a massive nose  when she pulls off her volleyball sunglasses.  Holy fuck.  Something about wearing those volleyball sunglasses and having a big nose.  It kind of works.  It kind of works out.  But as soon as they take the glasses off, fuck.  Okay.  Wow.  And when is Usain Bolt running?  Today?  Is the 200-meter final today?  I don't know.  I can't get into that track thing. 
[01:07:00]  I love watching him, though.  You got to watch him, though.  I understand what you're saying, but he's so ridiculous.  I want to watch rhythmic gymnastics.  Ugh.  God, with the stupid ribbons and the balls.  And the fucking hoop.  And the hoop.  They use the hoop, too, right?  I don't know.  And then the other one where you've got to throw the shit up in the air and catch it  and do something.  I've got to give the water polo guys some respect.  Whoa.  I saw them walking out to play yesterday.  It was on NBC.  Big cocks?  Big cocks.  Nice.  And bruised to hell.  Oh, really?  Because they beat each other up. 
[01:07:30]  They're all fucked up.  That is something.  Half the guys, I'm exaggerating, obviously, but a lot of the guys had black eyes.  Really?  Because I guess you take a few elbows and fucking fists and shit.  They're throwing the elbows around, eh?  When they're fighting for the ball, they were all banged up.  Looks like it's a brutal sport.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't fool around when they're in the action there in front of the net.  And I was thinking of you because they're ready to start the match, and I guess it was  time to kind of get the muscles loose.  Yeah.  So they jump in the pool.  I'm like, what are you kidding me? 
[01:08:00]  You've got to save all your energy.  Why are you jumping in the pool already?  Yeah.  Why would they do that?  How long could you last in your pool without touching the sides if you had to?  Oh, my God.  Not very long at all.  Not nearly as long as he can last in pussy.  I think he's going to touch the sides.  Touch the sides.  Oh, that's adorable.  Tiny one.  Oh, God.  I guess that's it for the Olympics.  Right?  There wasn't anything else going on?  No, nothing.  I saw soccer with teams that didn't have USA in their name, so I didn't give a fuck. 
[01:08:30]  Did one of the gymnasts, like, there was a protest or something, I guess?  Yeah, it went from fourth to bronze, right?  To third.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess that was a big deal.  Yeah.  Oh, and this Lolo, she's got to relax.  What's wrong?  What's up her ass?  Well, Lolo is a hurdler.  Mm-hmm.  She comes from a very broken family.  Mm-hmm.  And four years ago, she was going to win the gold medal, and she fucked up and hit a hurdle 
[01:09:00]  and either fell or it was enough to knock her out of the race.  Uh-huh.  So she's been waiting four years to, you know, try to redeem herself.  Try it again.  And she's probably got the most coverage going into these Olympics, probably.  Close to her and Michael Phelps pretty much got the most coverage.  And it turns out, I didn't even know this, she wasn't even close to being the best for  our own team.  Oh, really?  And she didn't medal at all, so a bunch of people kind of beat her up for it, and now 
[01:09:30]  she's crying on TV about how she was treated by the media.  Oh, jeez.  She should have never had the coverage to begin with.  She wasn't that good this time around.  Wow.  Going into the Olympics.  She don't look that bad, is she?  Oh, she's pretty hot, I think.  Oh, then who cares?  I think she's pretty hot.  But she did say that she worked six days a week.  Did she stay up for 12 hours?  12 hours a day. 
[01:10:00]  Crazy.  She trained six.  Sane.  She said she trained six days a week for four straight years for one, listen to this,  how crazy this is, for one 12-second race.  Wow.  Can you imagine that?  No.  Getting no satisfaction for what you do for four fucking years, and then it all comes  down.  Yes, I can imagine that.  We're up to eight.  And then it's all for one, just one 12-second race for the gold medal. 
[01:10:30]  Crazy.  Wow.  Six days a week for four straight years.  Yeah, Olympic athletes, it's a weird thing.  Oh, you got the clip?  Four fucking years.  I think she explains how she got beat up by the media here.  Oh.  One-tenth of, one-one-hundredth of a second?  Yeah, well, that's a big difference in track.  Well, I mean, it seems like a small difference.  You can't really clock it.  But for track, I think that's a big difference.  How are you feeling this morning?  I mean, I'm okay.  I think it's disappointing in one extreme, as in I didn't get the medal.  But in another extreme, like, you know, a year ago, exactly a year ago, I was having spinal 
[01:11:00]  cord surgery.  So, I mean, if I look at that, I'm like, okay, like, look at all the things you've been through.  You had spinal cord surgery, two hamstring injuries, and you fought through all of that,  you know?  So I keep trying to focus on that and not the, like, negativity I've received, you know, from  the other one.  No, you made it here.  But I know last night you tweeted about dealing with a broken heart.  Is that how it feels?  Yeah, definitely.  I mean, I was crushed afterwards.  I mean, I know I had the best race of my season, not the best race of my life, but, I mean, I 
[01:11:30]  had the best race of my year.  So, I mean, I just try to look at that.  But, you know, it doesn't take away from the pain that, you know, I was so close to, you  know, once again, having a medal and, you know, not getting it.  This was the fastest women's hurdles race in Olympic history.  Does that make you feel better at all, just knowing that, I mean, you were facing the  toughest competition there was?  No, I think, I mean, I think it's awesome that, you know, we all knew this because all  the girls were running amazing this year, and we could just feel that there was going  to be something happen, like something special is going to happen. 
[01:12:00]  We knew it.  Yeah, she's really hot.  But it doesn't make you feel better.  It's like, oh, my God, I got me a medal.  You know, the other...  She didn't even medal.  You mentioned you've been dealing with a lot of tough stuff lately.  The New York Times did a very tough piece, criticizing you for being more imaged than a  accomplishment.  Yeah.  How hard was that to deal with?  I think it was crazy just because it was two days before I competed, and then the fact  that it was from a U.S. media, like, I mean, they should be supporting our U.S. Olympic  athletes, and instead they just ripped me to shreds, and I just thought that that was 
[01:12:30]  crazy because I worked six days a week every day for four years for a 12-second race.  I wouldn't mind pumping her.  Oh, you hear that?  There's the part.  Go back.  I'm sorry.  Go back.  I'm sorry.  Oh, here she goes.  She's breaking down.  But this is where she said what I told you.  Listen, it's crazy to try to wrap your mind around this.  They just ripped me to shreds, and I just thought that that was crazy because I worked  six days a week every day for four years for a 12-second race. 
[01:13:00]  And the fact that they just tore me apart, it was just heartbreaking.  I'm not like, you know, they need to do the research, called me the Anaconda Clover  lift track.  I have the American record holder.  I'm an American record holder at two world window titles, and just because I don't boast  about these things, I don't think I should be ripped apart by the age.  So I'm that lady out there.  I fall apart from my country.  And I think it's just a shame that I have to deal with so much backlash when I'm already 
[01:13:30]  so brokenhearted as it is.  You know, you have been...  Is this just great?  That clip is never not funny.  I love that one.  So, I mean, Bryant Gumbel did a whole piece on her.  That's where I became aware of her.  She's had a crazy wild life.  But in the end, she was more image.  Yeah.  She makes a lot of money through endorsements.  Good for her.  Four years ago, you know, she pretty much should have had the gold medal and hit a hurdle  or whatever it was, and she's been waiting four years, and she didn't get it done. 
[01:14:00]  I guess she should have done seven days a week for four years.  Well, the other American hurdlers who beat her, they're all pissed because they didn't  get any attention leading up to the Olympics.  None.  And it turned out they've been better than her for a while now.  That's the way it goes.  Google image her, though.  You've got to see some of her pictures.  Yeah, Google.  Google image her.  Google image her, and let's see what the fuck she looks like.  All right.  Oh.  Oh.  We're not here. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  How about a full body shot, you fucking homo?  Why?  Why what body?  Oh.  Give me some.  Sorry.  I just looked up.  Father blew her off.  You know, all that shit.  They were living in, like, a basement somewhere.  Yeah?  Yeah, just a horrible, horrible upbringing.  Oh.  But she, uh.  Where'd she live?  She fought through all that.  There we go.  Yeah, okay.  Dude, look at that.  Look at how muscular she is.  She is fucking hot, man.  She's hot, right?  Look at her legs and her little, the front of her bathing suit. 
[01:15:00]  I'd give that a big smush.  Take your fucking index fingers and that fucking thing.  Just pull that down.  Fat vag pops out, right?  Yeah.  Fuck.  And then you just go.  She's a virgin.  Oh, is she the virgin?  She's a virgin.  Oh, no.  I heard about that.  What's that about?  Wow.  She probably hates her vagina.  It's probably so big and bulbous and delicious.  Oh, God.  Wow.  What's that about?  How old is she?  She's old enough where maybe.  She's not 16 or 15, is she?  Oh, no, no, no.  She's definitely in her 20s. 
[01:15:30]  You know.  I'm just waiting for the right person.  That's what she's going to be.  Oh, God.  She's 30.  She's 30.  It's still a virgin.  I'm going to guess.  My guess.  That's a problem.  I'm sorry.  My guess is that she's gay or she was.  It's purely a guess.  I know nothing about her.  Or someone did some diddling without.  Yeah, there's something going on.  I understand there's people out there.  They want to be a virgin until they get married, blah, blah, blah.  But then there's others.  And I think it's more of a majority.  There's something deep going on.  If you want to save yourself a marriage, whatever. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  But you better get married at like 20, 21, 22.  But if you're saving yourself a marriage and you're 30, at that point,  just cash it in.  Fucking get laid and then try to figure it all out.  It'll help you in the long run.  Where's she from?  What's her personal?  What's her nationality?  I forget.  She's hot, man.  Yeah.  Imagine what a fucking...  You just shoved it in there.  See, I don't like virgins.  I like them dirty.  But I bet you she has like a very large, bulbous...  She's probably embarrassed by her vaginal... 
[01:16:30]  Like what I would consider a gift.  She considers it...  Oh, my God.  That's probably what slows her down.  Yeah, hindrance.  The wind probably hits the front of her panties and slows her down.  And at 30, that hymen's got to be like a piston ring.  Just a little fucking...  A little hardened.  A little leather-like.  It's probably leaking on the side.  Like whenever she runs very fast, it goes...  Oh, yeah.  My apnea mask leaks.  When you're that hot and you're 30 and you're still a virgin,  there's something else going on. 
[01:17:00]  I guess lesbian.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the whole track thing, yeah.  Yeah, maybe.  Track, really?  Yeah, I think a lot of the girls in track might...  The gals?  Like to look at each other.  That's what Ann finds unattractive about her,  because she seems like she has a bit of a masculine...  Yeah, a little masculine.  I don't like masculine girls.  Yeah, I don't either, Jimmy.  What are you talking about?  I'm saying that's what...  I like them a little soft, you know?  But Ann's something I didn't like,  and I'm guessing because her voice is a little...  We're good.  We're good.  But she's very kissable. 
[01:17:30]  I'm not saying she...  No, she's one of the hotter fucking athletes...  Athletic women I've seen.  I'm going to tug my weenie.  Well, she's got the mix going on.  What is she?  I don't know.  The father was black.  What?  I thought there was a little in there.  Oh, you didn't know that?  I didn't...  Wow, I didn't tell.  Oh, yeah, of course.  I thought I saw a little bit in there.  I didn't notice that.  And the mom...  Yeah, you can see a little.  She's got some fucking Sam Roberts look to her right there.  I can hear a bit in her voice, but...  Yeah.  You can hear it in the voice?  Yes, a little bit.  A little bit of the accent.  Tell us more, Jimmy the Greek.  You could tell that she probably talks with a lot more of what would be considered an 
[01:18:00]  urban slang or an urban vernacular, and that she slightly changes or forces herself  to change when she speaks for an Olympic interviews.  The beauty of this show, you want to talk to her neighbor?  What?  Come on.  Oh, man.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, finally Sam finds the good shot.  Sam finally finds a good picture.  She's completely naked in this one.  Yeah, she's sitting on a chair.  She's turned in a certain way where you can't see any titty or anything, but you see ass  crack.  Yeah, the ass crack is nice, and then she's turning her head toward the camera in a seductive 
[01:18:30]  way.  Well, if she's going to do that, then fuck the rest of the runners.  I mean, she's no E-Rock with her sexy look.  No.  Where's your purple shirt?  But she does a good job, too.  Oh, E-Rock.  Would you give her an A for effort on the sexy look, E-Rock, now that you're the expert?  Or just sit there.  Reed, what's up, buddy?  Hold on, Reed.  Hold on.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  What were you doing?  I didn't hear what you said.  Oh, you are listening to this show. 
[01:19:00]  Sam, you want to take this?  Well, you know what he was doing in there.  What?  What was he doing?  Well, SummerSlam's in two weeks, and he's writing a little fantasy card.  A little fan fiction.  Yeah, yeah.  He loves his fan fiction.  The NWO coming back and stuff like that.  I have to read something.  He's in mission control.  Yeah.  What were you doing, E-Rock?  I was talking to somebody.  Oh, my God.  The old job is to listen.  Oh, my God.  You're no Mohawk guy.  That's for sure.  What?  Jet Propulsion Laboratory?  That guy?  Oh, right.  He's a big deal now. 
[01:19:30]  Who is he?  He's a big star.  Mohawk guy?  Yeah.  He's on every meme around.  He's part of the Mars thing.  Yeah, the Mars mission.  Oh, she don't look good there.  No, she wears weird, shitty things.  She's got little bosoms.  Who's that?  It's just me talking about her little bosoms.  She's not very chesting.  No, she's not.  Her little bosoms.  No.  All right, Reed, what do you got, buddy?  AIDS.  Oh, wrong Reed. 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  Sorry.  Reed.  Yeah.  She lives in Baton Rouge.  Yeah.  And she's your neighbor?  Yeah, she lives in a suburb just outside of Baton Rouge.  Went to LSU.  And she's a Tebow.  She goes to one of these big stadium right-wing churches.  Oh.  Oh, one of those things.  Oh, she's a Tebow.  I like how you put that.  Where they shut their eyes, look up, and wave their arms above their head in the air?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's that crazy church shit. 
[01:20:30]  Yep.  Man.  Oh, boy.  That means she's fucked up in the head.  Imagine the amount of baggage you'd have to fucking deal with going out with this fucking  prod.  It certainly didn't help that the father left him.  Well, that makes sense now.  But now the father's back in her life.  And that makes sense, too.  And comes by a couple times a year.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I'm getting you a Louis Vuitton.  Kraft macaroni and cheese.  What a dope. 
[01:21:00]  I know we did this two days ago.  I love that guy.  I love it.  He thinks everything goes away when you get them a Louis Vuitton.  Yeah.  I got you a Louis Vuitton.  That's like my mom going to me.  I got you a Louis Vuitton.  Louis Vuitton.  You'd be like, oh, all's forgiven.  All right, good.  I'm good now.  All's forgiven.  All right, Reed.  I guess you have a lot to add to the show here.  Yes, right.  So why don't you go ahead?  Yeah, she's also got huge Olympic rings in her front yard.  You can't miss it.  Huge Olympic rings?  Well, she's in the Olympics. 
[01:21:30]  It's not like she's fucking not.  Fucking life-size.  Like you can't miss it.  Yeah.  I wonder if that's where Ella lives.  She's in the Olympics.  Well, she could tell people she was an Olympian.  That's good.  Yeah.  You're just a hater.  She hasn't medaled.  She's a hater.  Hater.  Not a participator.  Yeah, that broad looks horrendous.  Yeah, right, Reed?  Thank you.  That broad looks horrendous.  That's a great call.  She looks horrendous in that dress.  Who?  Just that broad looks.  I can't say.  I don't want to get any resources. 
[01:22:00]  I'll tell you.  Point the bitch out later.  Oh, the one that's a little, a little, what?  Oh, oh, oh.  I see.  I wouldn't even look anyway.  I'm facing that way.  What the fuck?  I've looked at some dumpy chicks walking around this joint and thought I'd throw them a dick in.  Some of them.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  What's going on with Mars?  We do anything yet?  We landed on Mars.  When do we get to see some shit?  I thought you meant that.  Where is Mars, by the way? 
[01:22:30]  Exactly.  Don't say next to Venus or Earth or something.  I don't know.  Next to penis if it's the Mars we're talking about.  Yeah.  It's actually next to Earth.  That's a pretty red planet.  Damn.  Damn.  What's going on with Mars?  Anything?  Oh, God.  Jesus.  I'm sorry.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stung.  It's so bad.  E-Rock, we better go to a break.  We got to like.  Oh, it's so bad.  Out of the studio.  Thanks.  Oh, God.  We were just talking about Randy Travis. 
[01:23:00]  Yes.  Randy Travis used to be massively huge.  Probably the number one country music artist in America for a long time.  Pretty big.  To the point even my mom knew who he was.  I think my mom was a big Randy Travis fan. 
[01:23:30]  Oh.  Fast forward a bunch of years, and you forget about him, and all of a sudden he pops up  in the news because he's drunk, naked, and crashing a car.  Nice.  But didn't he do something like this a year or two ago as well?  Was that him?  He was in a car drunk or had been drinking, and I think the cops pulled up in the parking  lot, and he was there with a bottle of wine in his car.  This is this time or last time?  No, last time.  This time he walked in naked.  What do you mean he walked in naked?  He walked to a convenience store nude.  He tried to buy something, and the guy goes, how are you going to pay for this?  Then he just walked out, and then he crashed his car, I believe, and then he threatened 
[01:24:00]  the troopers.  He was already arrested, but he threatened to shoot them or something.  Whoops.  That's a bad move, man.  Who knows about Randy Travis out there?  Help us out.  Because he was massive, and then just kind of went away.  Yeah.  I mean, a guy like that should be touring still and doing really, really well, even if he  hasn't had a hit out in a while.  I knew nothing about him, and I watched a little bit of him last time on YouTube.  That song, Digging Up Bone.  He just fell off the face of the earth is what happened, I guess. 
[01:24:30]  But how do you go from where he was?  He was a lot of artists, I guess.  Yeah, but he wasn't one of those one-hit wonder guys.  No.  He had real talent.  When was he big?  He was winning all sorts of Grammys.  80s, 90s?  Oh, boy.  He was like country Paul Williams.  90s?  That's kind of...  You know, Paul Williams was big.  Oh, my gosh.  Is that Danny Bonaduce on TV?  Yes, they know it.  No.  No.  Oh, my God.  Okay, because he looks like a fucking really old Danny Bonaduce.  No, that's that guy. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  One of those hairdresser guys.  Wow.  He's old now.  Who is that guy?  I don't know.  With all this writing, you think they could have his name on stage.  Right, right.  And Squawk Box, they have everything else but this guy's name.  I keep thinking...  You know, Kenny knows.  I believe it's Paul Mitchell.  Paul Mitchell.  Paul Mitchell.  Yay.  No, Uncle Paul.  Who is that?  Paul Mitchell.  He used to be on commercials selling his hair products. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, he liked the shampoo.  But he looked different then.  Hey, we got that Randy Travis song for Jim Norton.  I was just watching this on YouTube.  It was pretty good.  Last night I dug your picture out of my old dresser drawer.  I set it on the table and I talked to it till four.  I read some old love letters right up till the break of dawn. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, I've been sitting alone, digging a bone.  I gotta ask.  You like this hit?  No.  It's stuff.  Why don't you like stuff?  Why don't I like stuff?  Meaning music.  That's my...  That's how I say why don't you like music.  Stuff, what they call them now?  Anthony likes stuff.  Anthony likes just a certain type of music and that is it.  No, I like other stuff, but it's too embarrassing to say, you know? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah, but who cares?  I admit it to the Thompson twins.  It can't be worse than that.  No, I'll listen to like ELO.  I like ELO.  What, you know?  It's like Electric Light Orchestra.  Not so much.  It's good, right?  I like that song.  I like Three Dog Night.  Wait, what do you like about ELO?  I don't know.  I like Harmonix.  Three Dog Night is good to us.  Sounds all weird and shit.  But ELO was good to us. 
[01:27:00]  Three Dog Night is pretty cool.  I don't mind Three Dog Night.  They did Mama Told Me Not Toom.  Mama Told Me Not Toom.  She said...  Yeah, yeah.  I like that.  Wait, what do you like about ELO?  Which songs do you like by ELO?  What the hell?  With this playing, there's no way I'll be able to get another one in my head.  I'm trying to remember.  I used to play them on the radio and I can't remember.  Don't bring me down. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  No, this is kind of...  Yeah, this one is like the popular one.  No, you don't like this one?  Yeah.  I like this.  Yeah, this is...  I would listen to this.  Which one are you talking about, though?  Turn to Stone?  Oh, Turn to Stone.  Put on Turn to Stone.  Let me hear a little of that.  They're harmonizing that, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like the bands that harmonize.  It's a weird fucking sound they had.  It's a weird song.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is kind of fun. 
[01:28:00]  This is good.  This is good.  Right?  It's really weird.  It's like a weird sound.  Anyone ever point out they sound like Queen at times?  Yeah, well, it's a whole thing.  There's that, like, Queen, George Harrison was big with these guys.  Yeah, I kind of like it. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, it's not...  That's not bad.  Thompson Twins is way worse.  He left music to become a preacher, this Randy Travis.  Oh.  Really?  Well, that worked out well.  Why would you do that?  You have that talent.  Why would you do that?  Was this the song that the credits rolled on Boogie Nights at the end?  Oh, maybe that's why I like Yellow so much.  No, I liked it before that, but...  I don't know, to be honest with you.  Is it?  Is it?  Strange Magic.  Put on Strange Magic.  Strange Magic! 
[01:29:00]  God damn it, E-Rock.  The boss asked for something.  No, this wasn't the one either, but...  This is one of the slower build stuff.  It sounds like Elvis Costello.  Ah, right.  Remember this?  Mm-hmm.  Ah, yes.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:29:30]  By the end, it's like...  He doesn't want to admit he might like a slow song.  No, I do like that.  Yeah, I think he's a hot song.  No, I like slow songs, too, you know.  Yeah?  Oh, uh, it's a living thing.  Living thing!  Living thing!  Put on living thing!  This is the one that was at the end of Boogie Nights.  Ah, this is a cool song.  Right after he whips his dick out, he puts his dick back in, he walks through the door  and slams the door, and then went...  Dun, dun!  Yeah! 
[01:30:00]  The door shuts...  And the credits start rolling.  It's fucking perfect!  This is probably my favorite ELO song.  Right?  Yeah.  You don't have to sell it.  That's a good one.  That's good shit.  Magic!  Jeff Lynn was an engineer on Abbey Road.  Really?  Really?  Gopher stew?  Is that true?  I think so. 
[01:30:30]  Jeff Lynn is a fucking genius.  Uh, some would say yes.  Yeah.  He has been, uh...  Higher and higher, baby!  Ah, ah!  It's a living thing!  Some fucking string sounds in there.  It's just a weird little sound they had.  I didn't know you liked ELO, guys.  Yeah.  With you.  Big ELO fan!  You're gonna see him on the space shuttle!  We're gonna send you to Mars!  Yeah!  First person in space! 
[01:31:00]  First person in space!  The guy from ELO was in, uh, Traveling Wilburys, too.  Yes.  Yeah, we know that.  Yes.  We're old enough to know that.  I did appreciate a few Wilburys songs, too, you know.  Did you?  And, uh, and I will also like, uh, some Roy Orbison.  I hate Roy Orbison.  I think he's overrated.  Yeah?  And I know that's gonna piss some people off.  Roy Orbison was fucking...  I never got into Roy.  That one song, I guess. 
[01:31:30]  What's, uh, what was his big, big hit?  Uh, The Lonely, or Only the Lonely, or Only the Lonely.  That one ain't mine.  But he sang like that on every song.  All right, people saying Roy Orbison sucks balls, but, you know, it's whatever it was.  Damn, damn, damn.  He was in the Traveling Wilburys.  Wilburys.  Yeah, and Three Dog Night, of course, is, uh, one of my favorites, also.  By the way.  Favorites?  Uh, yeah.  I, I, I really fucking like Three Dog Night. 
[01:32:00]  I also like fucking, uh, Moody Blues.  I like the Moody Blues.  I know I'm naming a lot of old fucking bands here, but, you know.  You ever see the Moody Blues?  Never saw them.  I saw them.  When?  A few times.  Too long ago now.  Yeah.  90?  Yeah.  I think it was around 90, 91, and they were old back then?  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  Oh, Jesus.  A Three Dog Night.  Look at these.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  I like he's a hair stylist. 
[01:32:30]  How many guys in that picture have fake hair?  I see definitely two out of the four.  I'd say the two corner guys.  The guy right up top has some kind of a hair system.  Oh, my God.  He's got a hair system.  Wow.  Needs to go in for a tightening.  Top left with the gray beard.  He doesn't.  I don't know their, you know their names?  No.  I forgot their names, too.  It's been a while.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang. 
[01:33:00]  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.  Yeah, I'm kind of a faggot with my music.  No, it's old school 70s shit.  I mean, it's okay.  I want to know about Three Dog Night, though, because you said that's one of your favorites.  Yeah, like, you know.  Give me the five songs.  Oh, five songs to be your favorites.  Maybe they're not one of my favorites.  They have a couple of songs that were my favorites is kind of what I meant.  Like what?  Like that fucking, it's so hard to come up with the names.  What a big fan.  I know, right?  I can't. 
[01:33:30]  No, this is that.  You know?  Jeremiah was a big fan.  Celebrate is good.  Celebrate.  Oh.  And then the one that fucking, what's his name wrote?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're one of those bands.  Just an old version of song.  Playing on the radio.  Coming down in three-part harmony.  Just an old version of song.  One of my songs, they wrote for you in me.  Do you think, are we like traveling, Wilburys, because we're traveling? 
[01:34:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We're traveling today.  I have a song you guys should hear.  Waiting for night to fall.  Oh, I like this shit.  I just gave you a song.  Yeah?  This is a song?  Yeah, it's a song.  All right, we're going to get to it.  Oh, it's funny, though.  All right, relax. 
[01:34:30]  He wants me to play this.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  He hands me during the break.  We'll get to it.  Okay.  How funny is it?  It's good.  You'll like it.  You're risking everything on this.  That's fine.  Well, we've got to go back to Randy Travis.  So he walked into the convenience store naked.  Yes.  Holy fuck.  What kind of balls does that taste?  He was just drunk.  Could you walk anywhere naked in public?  Not if I was sober.  Were you a naked guy when you used to get drunk?  No, no, no, no.  But if you're in a blackout and you're just in one of those places, nothing matters. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, I reckon that's what happened.  Did you walk around naked in?  He was drunk.  No, no.  It's kind of a very...  I could barely walk around naked in my own house.  I feel very vulnerable.  Yeah.  No, inside, I don't give a shit.  As long as there's somebody else there.  It's weird when you're alone, naked.  I'd rather put something on when I'm alone in the house.  You know what I hate about kids?  What's that?  They don't have any filters.  I'm not saying anything new, but I have no shirt on. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  And my kid grabs my tits and goes, boobies.  What the fuck?  Fucking kids have no filters.  And I know I'm not saying anything new, but it has to be said again.  Damn.  They have no fucking filter.  I thought I had no filter.  Shit.  That's got to fucking sting.  Huh?  That's got to sting a little.  You think?  I think you heard Troy's feelings. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  No, I know.  He just bitched out?  No, no, he didn't.  He had some.  I've heard it.  It's actually funny.  Yeah, but we're wrapping up our Randy Travis thing.  This is a whole thing we were doing.  Oh, man.  He fucking hurt his little feelings.  I know this sounds like we're just kind of fucking off, but there's like, it works in  the end.  Can he?  He's very excited about that.  All right.  He was very excited about something he brought in. 
[01:36:30]  But we're in the middle of talking about Randy Travis, and then we went off-roading with  some ELO.  Oh, man.  I just think it ties in to the Chicago trip.  But to more than that.  Yeah.  We could talk about your physique later.  Did I hurt your feelings?  Oh, man.  We were in the middle of something.  No, I said that.  I think you might have hurt Troy's phrase a little bit.  But do you realize we're doing a radio show?  I do.  Where there is actually a weird structure to this whole thing?  But I'm contributing to it.  I can't wait to play it.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Holy shit. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Is this really happening?  Oh.  A little more consideration would be nice.  Well, someone won.  I worked hard on it.  All right.  How about this?  You're fucking dicking him over.  All right.  You play it.  And if it sucks, you're going to get a fucking murdering.  Oh, my God.  Now?  A murdering.  Do you have anything on Randy Travis?  Because that's what we're talking about.  It's a huge story today.  Nobody gets to talk about him.  He used to be a big fucking deal, though.  And now he's naked.  Walking around drunk.  I mean, that's just. 
[01:37:30]  And someone just wanted to say that his big hit was forever and ever.  Amen.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's a good song.  Can you play that?  And then we'll get to Troy's thing.  Just to wrap it up, Troy.  All right.  It's cool, dude.  That's a good song.  Yeah?  Does that?  I think this guy's good.  Turn it up.  Turn it up.  I don't know what it sounds like now. 
[01:38:00]  And wouldn't have been able to do that if I listened to you.  This is kind of nice.  I like this.  He's good.  He had a great voice.  I don't know what it sounds like now.  Okay.  He's good.  I'm no longer one of those guys.  He's right on my horse.  As sure as I live, this love that I give is gonna be yours until the day that I die. 
[01:38:30]  I grew up on country music, you know, in California.  But it was old country.  You know?  Forever and ever, amen.  No one knows what goes on behind closed doors.  Oh, Charlie Rich.  Take the ribbon from your hair.  Hair.  Yeah, all that shit.  I don't mind a country song every once in a while.  That's what I grew up on.  You should like it more than I'm thinking.  Country.  You should like it more, no? 
[01:39:00]  Uh, yeah, I guess so.  I like country music.  Well, I pulled out of Pittsburgh rolling down the eastern sideboard.  I got my diesel wound up and she's running like I never before.  There's a speed zone and here we're all right.  I don't see a cop inside.  Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  I just want to know why Troy's such a bitch.  Yeah.  What's going on?  And he's trying to take the...  Holy shit, he's such a bitch.  What's going on?  He's also, he's taking the wind, like you're trying to do something and you'll be like, 
[01:39:30]  yeah, we'll get to yours.  And he's like, nobody gives a fuck about that.  And you're like, I'm trying to do it.  Like, he's taking the wind out of your segment.  This all ties in.  To what?  You guys have been talking about music.  I'm trying to take you guys in from the fucking 70s in this country bullshit.  Oh, wow.  Sorry.  I'm trying to bring it all together to see you guys.  Maybe if you sang a little of that, you'd be able to fucking talk this thing.  Jesus.  Wow.  Is the 40-year-old saying we're sounding a little old? 
[01:40:00]  I'm trying to bring it back around for you guys.  Let's fucking, let's bring it into 2012.  Bring it back around.  2012.  Wow.  Holy shit.  And this is funny?  I worked on this fucking song.  What are we about to hear?  Oh, man.  I don't even know what it is.  Holy shit.  I heard a second of it.  I say give it a minute and then we'll make a determination.  Give it one minute.  Give it a minute and we'll make a determination.  How can we give it a minute if it's only 30 seconds?  Let's just play.  Let's play.  Let's play.  All right.  Here we go. 
[01:40:30]  Let's listen.  Oh, yeah.  Pump my dick up.  Pump my dick up.  Oh, yeah.  Pump my dick up.  Pump my dick up.  Go to break, cocksucker.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:41:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  So I guess we all got bamboozled.  I'll take responsibility for this.  Damn.  Poor Troy.  He fell on the knife well.  He did?  Yeah.  Because I wanted to make it.  I was like, how can I get a go to break chip in without it being the same thing?  So I'm like, I'll do it through production.  So I told Troy.  I walked in.  I'm like, can you put something together?  That's 20 or 30 seconds.  That just throws fucking stupidness in. 
[01:41:30]  I just went to tape it.  I told Eric, just be ready.  Because this way you guys wouldn't be looking for it.  I wasn't.  And fucking, but Troy came in.  And I know how he just handed you a thing and he goes, yeah, this will tie it with Chicago.  But then we just started talking about something else.  I'm like, all right.  Yeah.  So I texted Troy.  I'm like, just come in studio and stand.  Hopefully that will inspire Ope to play it.  But then we got off on another three.  It was just like literally a natural conversation.  So poor Troy was being a soldier there. 
[01:42:00]  He didn't want to be confrontational.  He was just falling on the knife to get the production played.  He probably wanted to be a little comfortable.  So it was supposed to, we were supposed to come back for a break, play that immediately.  Within the first couple of minutes.  And then it's Chip, you know, bringing us back to breath.  Yeah, just wrecking it.  And taking it out of the way.  To do that bit.  And it was still too soon for a break.  So I still feel good about it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there was no way.  I didn't want to give it away.  That would have been funnier.  I don't like giving it away.  Oh, well.  But there was no way to know it because I didn't tell him.  Yeah, I didn't know.  I didn't know what the hell was going on.  No, I didn't know.  I thought Troy was just being a bitch. 
[01:42:30]  No, not at all.  A bitch.  No, that's why.  Why do you think I threw him under the bus?  I was like, I think Troy got his feelings hurt.  I just made that up.  That was pretty funny.  But it looked like he got his feelings hurt because he left.  Yeah, yeah, no.  He's good.  Well, he didn't want to stand here and be imposing, I'm guessing.  Yeah.  It would have been better if he was fired for that and I didn't stick up for him.  I just mentioned it years later.  Remember that time?  Oh, yeah.  By the way, I put him on.  Yeah.  All right.  Man.  So we were talking about ELO and all this shit.  Yeah, other bands because I don't like anything. 
[01:43:00]  No, it's good when you tell us what you like.  Because I just assume you like Alice in Chains and maybe like.  Yeah, but not all the time.  You know, sometimes I delve into some crap.  You like some good harmonizing.  Yeah, I really do like it.  I like melodic music.  I really do.  I was actually listening to it because I couldn't sleep last night.  I had the TV on, but there's really nothing on.  I know.  I know.  But I just, we're going to play some music.  So first I started playing the Chicago Police Scanner again. 
[01:43:30]  Just seeing what's going on.  That's musical?  Well, to my ears.  It's cops rousting minorities.  That's a love song for you, huh?  That's hilarious.  That's a slow jam.  Oh, every time you tune in.  And then I went to some music.  You know, some sleepy music.  Little Beatles, you know?  I think there was a little Elton John in there for the faggy side of myself.  What Elton John?  Rocket Man's a great tune.  Rocket Man. 
[01:44:00]  You got to go leave on.  I think it was like Philadelphia Freedom.  That's a great one.  But it wasn't.  That's not if he's trying to go to sleep.  No.  You know, Funeral for a Friend.  Real long.  Starts off all creepy.  You don't know that one either?  Jimmy.  I don't think I do.  How does that go?  You probably wouldn't know the beginning, but you'd know it when it kicked in.  Does it go like...  Funeral for a Friend.  Funeral for a Friend.  And I am ahead and do a funeral for a Friend. 
[01:44:30]  It's a really cool intro.  It just keeps building.  Oh, this is like the wind at the funeral?  Yeah.  It's windy day.  Scary.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Kind of weird.  It's an Elton John song, right?  I know.  It's weird.  A lot of times you never would realize what this was.  What the song was.  And then it would kick in and you'd go, oh, right.  This one.  I bet you he wrote this in 1986.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  When a new disease popped off.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  It's way before 86.  Oh, man.  I do believe.  This is a 70s song, right?  Yeah.  Musically, it's kind of cool.  Yeah.  Oh, it's very...  Yeah.  Beginning.  Oh.  Come into my castle. 
[01:45:30]  My friend got hit by a bus.  That's it.  You know for a friend.  Beginning is crazy long, right?  This was always a tough one to play on rock radio.  Oh, man.  Isn't there a way they would cut the beginning off? 
[01:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  They didn't like the long intros and the long songs.  They would start it right here.  Yeah.  With the piano, right?  Doesn't that start...  Yeah.  Right here.  Yeah.  This is where they usually would start it.  Now, there's the Elton John sound you recognize.  That's good, yeah.  Bring him some broth for food for his poodle.  Walking his small dog.  And he's wearing his robe. 
[01:46:30]  His socks are falling down.  He has something on his face that won't wipe off.  Jesus.  I hope it was worth it.  He's lighter today than yesterday.  I'm playing this on his ribs.  He was America's favorite dad.  We buried him ass up so his friends could do something.  I forgot the joke. 
[01:47:00]  Park their bikes.  You remember that?  Nice.  I thought I heard them all.  The dad shuffling in his slippers.  With tissues tucked in a rubber band around his wrist.  And the rubber band is very small.  Because his wrists are huge.  He smells like Jimmy's asshole.  It's the type of rubber band.  Why are you farting so much?  Oh, it's so bad. 
[01:47:30]  I got to travel jitters.  He's got to travel jitters.  Holy shit.  We are going to Chicago.  Can you tell?  I'm not getting any of these.  Oh, my God.  Can you tell we're fucking around today?  What?  I'm not getting any of these farts.  Oh, my God.  No, the farts are bad today, Jimmy.  Jimmy, it's so bad.  I'm sorry.  It's so bad.  I actually like this song.  I've never heard it.  Oh.  There's no words in this song, right?  Yeah, there is.  Oh.  There are.  But barely.  No, when it kicks in, it's a real song.  We've been playing it for five minutes.  I know.  The intro's very long. 
[01:48:00]  Visiting hours are from 7 o'clock to 11 o'clock, but he won't be here tomorrow.  The nurse told me you're not technically family.  Don't pull the plug. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, goodness.  Don't touch that drip.  It feeds me.  All right.  It took a while to get over here.  Zan, zan, zan, zan, zan, zan, zan, zan, zan.  Someone please call the nurse.  I have to shit.  It's gonna be runny and wet again.  My insides are pouring out of my asshole again. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  When does he start singing?  Yeah.  How long has this song been playing?  Hour and eight minutes.  Hour and eight minutes.  No, you're over five and a half now.  Wow.  He's good, though.  This is cool.  He's pompous.  Here we go.  No?  Oh, my God.  Don't they use this? 
[01:49:30]  I'm like...  This is Jeopardy!  Some kind of...  It does sound like that.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's look at my pictures from Studio 54.  All right.  Here he goes.  Now he's gonna start singing.  How long are we into it now? 
[01:50:00]  It almost said six minutes.  Holy fuck.  A six-minute intro?  How long is the whole song?  11 minutes, 52 seconds.  Now, this is the music to the vocal part.  He's got to kick in.  Oh, you know what?  I think this is where it starts.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  Wait, wait.  Here we go.  One, two, three.  There it is.  There it is. 
[01:50:30]  The album was pretty goddamn good, right?  I think so.  There it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day.  You said, sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace, I can't miss this game.  I love my feet in my hand.  Okay, fuck it.  Oh, Jesus.  Do it to know the man, you heard it. 
[01:51:00]  He's telling people, we're back dead.  Well, that's the song.  That's wonderful.  Holy fuck.  Well, he's gone this far.  He might as well write it out.  No, no, no.  Even we can't do that.  He's going to write it out.  We fucking wasted seven minutes.  Sam, why am I supposed to read this?  Whenever.  It's in the show.  Oh, okay.  What is it?  In the show?  Chicago?  Oh, cool.  Yeah, Chicago starts now, I guess.  Oh, my God. 
[01:51:30]  We're flying a fuck in Chicago.  We're already in Chicago, if you're listening to the show today.  Yeah.  Our minds are already there, I should say.  We're just fucking off until we have to leave for the airport.  Do you want to be there?  115 Bourbon Street?  Oh, yeah.  Why do they call it 115 Bourbon Street?  Because it's the 115th block.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  115 blocks from downtown.  Yeah.  Oh.  I think he's lying.  I'm just like, why would you name a bar an address that isn't the address for the bar?  It just seems weird.  Who wants to take the bet?  Am I lying? 
[01:52:00]  It's New Orleans themed.  Am I lying?  Yeah.  Put $100 where your mouth is.  I have $100 to put where my mouth is.  But you don't know how to bet.  If you think I'm lying and it's not, I don't have $100, you think to yourself, I'm going  to get $100.  Now tell me.  Am I lying?  I don't bet irresponsibly.  So that means you know I'm not lying.  I think you are.  115 blocks from downtown.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Were you just going to say anything?  No.  About what's on that paper?  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's, of course, it's 115 Bourbon Street in Marionette Park. 
[01:52:30]  Look for the people with strings on their hands and feet.  See?  No, see, Marionette Park is a place.  You're talking about Marionettes the puppets.  So?  Is it this right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Doors open at 2 p.m.  Oh.  Show starts at 3 p.m.  Central.  Central.  Central time.  Don't fuck up.  You've got to be 21, all right?  Or older.  We don't take exclusively just 21-year-olds.

Oh, hi, Kenny.  Kenny.  Hi.  Would you like some travel information?  Yeah.  Oh, do we have travel info?  Yes.  Do we have a travel info stinger? 
[01:53:30]  Anyone?  No?  Travel info.  I'll make one.  Nice.  Traveling or something.  I just checked our flight status.  Yeah.  And our flight is scheduled currently to take off on time.  Yeah.  However, is it landing late from, uh...  Our plane is coming from Dublin, Ireland.  Oh, man.  I hope they go over it.  How come they ain't doing it singling? 
[01:54:00]  Daddy, you ain't following that.  Scheduled to land 14 minutes late, so hopefully it won't upset us too much.  We'll be up there.  No, you're hoping it does upset us a lot.  No, no, G.H.  You are hoping for that.  I take no pleasure.  Jimmy?  He takes pleasure in bad news.  No.  Only...  No, Kenny only likes bad news if it validates a point he had been making earlier.  So, like, someone else is making the point for him.  Like, if the airlines, through their ineptness, makes the point for him, he'll be like, well... 
[01:54:30]  A bunch of fucking micks gonna be on that plane.  What happened?  Beforehand.  It's gonna smell like beer farts.  Like Guinness shits.  Yeah.  Right?  It's always...  I've taken the flight last week, and it's always different when they come back from Dublin.  Just the attitude of the cabin crew.  Yeah.  Oh, they're tired.  I'm like, can I have a Diet Coke?  Hey, don't you get it yourself?  Oh, doodly-doodly-do.  Oh, doodly-doodly-do.  Yeah, I'm like, what do you have?  I'm like, it's lunchtime.  Can I have a roast beef sandwich or some soup? 
[01:55:00]  And we have us roasted potatoes.  A diddly-diddly-dum.  A hoodly-diddly-dum.  Bye.  We're gonna have to hear this all the way to Chicago.  All the way to Chicago.  Hi, this is your captain speaking.  We'll be going to the fine-leaf clover pattern.  A hoodly-diddly-dum.  Oi, it's your captain speaking from the Floyd Dick. 
[01:55:30]  We'll be looking for a pot of wood on our way to Chicago, don't you know?  If you need to wash your hands, there's some Irish spring in the bathroom.  Get so drunk that you'd crash your car or something and kill a bunch of people. 
[01:56:00]  That's not funny.  Jesus, we're having fun.  What the fuck?  Jesus.  Thank you for that travel update, Kenny.  I will keep you advised.  Where was it before Dublin?  You probably know.  I'll check.  There was a stopover in Milan.  But the head stewardess had diarrhea, which delayed the flight.  He knows everything.  He knows everything.  Flying with regular unleaded.  Why wouldn't they just allow him to do everything? 
[01:56:30]  He's so good at it.  He's so good.  All right.  I do have the same hole.  Oh, Jesus.  He's coming back in fast.  Oh, my God.  Yes, Kenny.  Oh, is this another travel thing?  Yes.  Jimmy, if you will, the stinger?  Travel stuff.  The answer everyone is waiting for is Barcelona, Spain.  Ah, Barcelona.  Nice.  Barcelona. 
[01:57:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.  I would just jump up and go, how come Boss wasn't with anybody?  Boss!  Boss!  He cracks himself up.  Barcelona.  Fucking chipper.  Holy shit. 
[01:57:30]  All right.  Thank you, Kenny.  You're a sexy captain speaking.  That'd be nice, Barcelona.  I've never been to Spain, but I kind of like the music.  They say the ladies are insane there, and they sure know how to use it.  Right back to Three Dog Night.  Yeah.  That's good, Kenny.  Thank you.  Just got something. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, no.  On who?  On me?  What do you got on Sam?  No, I don't got anything on you.  He's staring at me.  Well, we could do the Dr. Drew thing.  People have been waiting for that for a couple days.  International planes get fucking great seats, right?  They do, but they're all so late because they go through customs and stuff.  Live flat seats you'll have where you're sitting.  Wait, we're going to lay down to Chicago?  In the same seat.  Holy shit.  Yes, we all just lay down in one seat.  We're going to lock up like Legos. 
[01:58:30]  VH, you'll be playing spoons with Jimmy.  Me and Jimmy in the same row?  Yes, and Anthony's across the aisle.  I have to sit next to a stranger?  Well, hopefully it won't be a stranger for long.  Anthony, there are no strangers, only friends we haven't met yet.  Oh, boy, it better not be.  Coming home, though, you'll be sitting next to...  Wait, me and Jimmy, we'll be laying next to each other?  Yes, we will be.  To Chicago?  Yes.  That's so creepy. 
[01:59:00]  And then Jimmy will lay with Anthony coming home.  Do I have a window seat?  No, I put you on the aisle so you can talk to Jimmy.  Oh, that's good.  Aisle to aisle.  I'll roll in a row.  All right.  Wait, I'm window guy.  Yeah, you're window aisle guy?  I do kind of like aisle guy.  Wait, you're aisle guy?  Yeah.  I got to go window every time.  I like window.  I know, usually, but I made an exception so you could...  Well, I kind of like windows, but that's okay.  No, Kenny, no.  It's fine.  It's fine.  I'd rather be able to talk to Jimmy as he puts his fucking neck thing on and his eye thing 
[01:59:30]  and just snores.  Oh, yeah, I have my mouth guard in, too, and I sleep.  Do you ever see my mouth guard in me?  I need to take a nap.  Hold on.  I'm tired.  I'll shake my mouth.  What am I going to have to deal with?  Ask Sam where he's sitting.  Sam, where are you sitting?  Sam, are you in the row next to Anthony?  No.  What?  But I am in economy plus.  Plus what, though?  What is the plus, Kenny?  Five extra inches of leg room?  Economy plus asshole equals Sam. 
[02:00:00]  Economy plus.  Economy plus.  Nice.  That's the mouth guard I sleep with.  It's not that bad, right?  Let me see.  What does it do to you?  It makes him look like the Godfather.  It really does.  He's struck by a bolt of lightning.  I'm going to blame some of the people.  That's pretty goddamn good with that thing in there.  Man, I do not forgive.  Wow.  It sounds just like him.  I think what he's trying to tell everyone, that Marlon Brando was a hack actor and all  he had was a fucking mouthpiece.  No, but you can't do the S's, though, because you have the S's. 
[02:00:30]  I can't make a crisp S.  It moves your bottom jaw forward.  Because when my bottom jaw is forward, I sleep better.  So maybe I should get one of those.  And you get used to it.  It gets a little annoying, but...  It really looks like it hurts.  No, it doesn't at all.  Hold on.  Bonnie!  That's how it sounds.  Bonnie!  But it's not that...  It's not that...  Well, it makes no difference to me how a man makes a living on this thing.  Oh, look at this.  You're a good job. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, good job.  I'm kind of liking this.  Yeah, it kind of...  Wow.  It makes you juggle forward a little bit so your throat doesn't collapse.  Right.  But it does sound stupid.  I wish I sounded...  Bonacera.  Bonacera.  What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectful?  That's pretty damn good.  But I just can't get the...  That's pretty damn good.  But the S's are terrible.  How do you say, can I suck your cock then?  I just point at it and go...  No, no.  I point at the cock and I go... 
[02:01:30]  You're spilling it.  You're spilling it.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  So you've got that, your eye things...  And your neck thing.  And your neck thing.  And your fucking...  Jesus Christ.  Did you bring any of this...  Anything for anyone else?  It was Bose headphones.  And the Bose headphones.  And I now have my little iPad.  So basically, I'm sitting by myself.  No, I'm not going to be socializing.  You're not even going to be able to talk for a while.  Jesus Christ.  See if there's any more room in economy. 
[02:02:00]  That's okay, Sam.  Enjoy that.  You could upgrade.  To what?  Uh-huh.  It may end up.  Why didn't you get him to get your first class ticket?  I'm just pulling your lunch.  I didn't realize I had a choice.  Probably cheaper than the 800.  Yeah, everyone's got a choice.  I chose where I'm sitting.  Where are you sitting, Kenny?  The emergency row so I could help people.  Shit.  He loves the leg room.  Are you able and willing to help people? 
[02:02:30]  Negative.  I'll be sound asleep.  And then they're going to have to move out of the way if there's a problem.  Yeah.  I'll be checking for cracks in my eyelids.  Cracks in his eyelids.  Heavy rain in Chicago today.  I'm getting updates on Twitter from everybody.  Is the rain going to affect our travel, Kenny?  God willing, no.  Well, we're going to Chicago.  It's going to be raining.  Oh, the good Lord will it in the creek don't rise.  If fucking Jimmy farts next to you, Opie, it's over, Jimmy. 
[02:03:00]  Or if.  How about when?  It is a when situation.  It has to.  Wow.  And what we really need to start thinking about is what time we're doing our Willis Tower tour  and what time we're doing...  What are you talking about?  ...police ride-along.  Oh, really?  Every day.  Well, if it's rainy, you don't want to do the tour in the rain if it's cloudy and shit, right?  No, but...  I'll be right back.  I'm going to tinkle.  Go make wee.  I can't wait.  Make wet.  Like, the guy is going to, like, stay overtime to accommodate people tonight. 
[02:03:30]  Man.  That's nice of him.  It is pretty good.  And then the police, like, you need to know when to dispatch from their office.  I'm on their fucking schedule.  I told them it'll be sometime after dinner.  That's perfect.  Are you going to the good neighborhood?  If you know what I mean?  It better be.  Yeah?  I don't want to see no fucking parking tickets being handed out, you know?  You want to see some...  I just want to see...  I want to get a good impression of what Chicago law enforcement is all about. 
[02:04:00]  I'm not saying they're going to do this, but in a perfect world, what do you want to see  on this ride-along?  Just what they deal with on a nightly basis.  You want to see some shit go down?  No, I just want to see what they deal with on a nightly basis.  That's all.  How about a foot pursuit?  That'd be fun.  A foot pursuit.  I won't be able to pursue.  Oh, believe me.  It'd be boring for me.  I'll just sit there.  But who's going to protect Anthony while they're running after the criminals?  No, no.  Smith and Wesson.  The way it's set up is they have a backup car trailing them. 
[02:04:30]  Uh-huh.  So if this shit goes down...  They throw me out.  ...the backup car handles the action.  And what happens to that?  They boogie on out of there.  Yeah, he watches.  I don't know.  I just get to watch.  From a distance?  From a distance.  I just get to watch.  Yeah.  I can't participate.  Unless, you know, let's say all the cops get pinned down, right?  And then I'm like, holy shit, I gotta fucking, you know...  Whoa, I gotta take the fucking initiative here. 
[02:05:00]  And then you turn into Charles Bronson.  Charles Bronson.  Right?  Hey, punk.  Oh, that's not him.  He didn't say punk.  He...  I think he did, though.  He said punk.  Will, do you believe in God?  That's a great one.  Will, you're gonna meet him.  That's a great line.  Or Jesus.  Yeah, that's what he said.  You believe in Jesus.  I got it.  I got it.  Should we take a break before we talk about Dr. Drew?  Sure.  Why not?  Do they hand the guns out?  Do they hand the guns out to the people?  Just citizens?  I would assume you get a gun tonight. 
[02:05:30]  Everyone has one in Chicago, it seems.  Why can't Ann have one?  When I listen to that scanner, it sure seems like everybody's got one.  So why can't Ann have a gun for his ride-along case?  They should just hand him out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's looking?  Right.  Who's looking?  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jimmy's back.  We're not taking a break.  I had to pee.  I don't know.  You had to?  I had to.  Yeah, I couldn't wait.  Dr. Drew is this guy who likes to help celebrities.  Help them.  Get over their addictions.  Except to meet Jesus. 
[02:06:00]  But he's pretty much an enabler and doesn't really do much of anything in the end.  But he's such a nice guy.  He really is a really, really nice guy.  Yeah.  And, Sam, I asked you to do a little research on Dr. Drew's celebrity rehab and Sober House and all that.  You want to go down the list of success stories that Dr. Drew has had since that show was on the air?  We want to start with season one?  Season one, sure.  All right.  Season one, notable cases are Shifty from, you know, the Come a Lady, Come Come a Lady song? 
[02:06:30]  Right.  Whatever that is.  Crazy Town.  Oh.  He was back to crack.  Mm-hmm.  He did two...  This was after he graduated the Dr. Drew program.  Yes.  He did two celebrity rehabs and two sober houses.  Okay.  In March, he was in a coma.  Right.  He's out of it now, but he's still obviously using.  Yeah, he was still in a coma.  Um, Daniel Ball...  Yeah, go ahead.  I was just going to say, the biggest problem, and to make this real for a second, what bothers me about Dr. Drew, 
[02:07:00]  he doesn't focus on the fact that these people are addicted to being celebrities, too.  Right.  Of course.  He ignores that part of the whole addiction thing that these guys go through.  You have, uh...  Daniel Baldwin was on season one, but left after four episodes.  He's good, right?  Well, they kicked him out because he was dirty texting Mary Carey, so nothing really changed with him.  Oh, right.  You're not supposed to do that.  Yeah.  That shouldn't even be on the list. 
[02:07:30]  Mary Carey went, uh, instead of, you know, it was recommended that she get sober and leave pornography.  Which she did for a while, I think.  Yeah.  She wanted to be a ballerina.  I remember seeing that episode.  Did she?  She wanted to go back to her roots of being a ballerina.  But I guess that didn't work out because she then turned around and made a movie called Celebrity Porn Hab with Dr. Screw.  Right.  That sounds too much like Dr. Drew, though.  You think so?  Yeah.  And she drinks socially.  You think he would be very pissed off by that?  Probably really irritated. 
[02:08:00]  Really.  Really has a slap in the face.  And yes, she drinks socially.  It's quote unquote.  Can people drink socially, Jimmy, if you have a problem?  I personally have not seen it last like that, but maybe they can.  But I've never witnessed it where it's worked.  That's a tough one, isn't it?  Very tough.  You had China was on that season.  Oh, she's doing well.  She has become a full-fledged porn star in the last year where she's actually a contracted star of pornography.  And she was recently, she passed out and had to be carried out of a porno signing. 
[02:08:30]  An autograph signing that fans come to.  She had to be carried out.  I hear she had to go to the hospital to get her stomach pumped.  A bunch of jizz was in there.  It was jizz.  Jizz.  And she graduated from the program?  She graduated, yeah.  These are all people that graduated from the program.  Yeah, yeah.  Season one.  This is all season one, by the way.  Oh, all just season one.  This is all season one.  Holy shit.  Isn't that more people than he had?  Oh my God.  This gets way worse, by the way.  Oh, I know.  Jeff Conway.  Jeff Conway.  He's doing well.  Well, he's dead. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, no, he's not.  He's dead.  Oh, please not.  He's lightning.  He is dead.  Oh, fuck.  What happened to him?  John Travolta wanted to suck his dick.  Yeah, and then he died from it.  Yeah.  From happiness.  Yeah.  Isn't that fucking weird?  Wow.  He's dead.  He was very addicted when I used to watch those shows.  Oh, yeah.  He was bad, right?  Really bad.  And super on the painkillers and everything.  He's fucking them up bad.  And finally, the last mentionable member of season one was Bridget Nielsen. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, she's doing really well.  That's what I heard.  She's a success story.  Yeah, last I heard.  I was actually flipping through the newspaper two days ago, and she was found laying down  in a park by herself drinking vodka and smoking cigarettes.  Was that really a picture of her on the ground?  Yeah, right there.  I got it here.  Look at this.  Oh, my God.  Just in an L.A. park.  But don't worry, the update is she has announced that she's fine.  Don't worry.  Oh, she's fine.  Yeah, she's cool.  She was just researching a role for a big hit movie, I bet.  Right?  Yeah.  It says she was seen rolling around in a Los Angeles park while swilling a bottle of vodka 
[02:10:00]  on Sunday.  Jesus.  But she graduated the Dr. Drew program.  Right.  From the Dr. Drew program.  Rolling around on the ground.  Okay.  Moving on to season two.  Shifty was back for season two from Crazy Town.  What is that name?  Shifty.  Right.  Yeah.  And as we said, he was in a coma earlier this year because of his drug use.  Jeff Conaway was back for season two.  But why are they coming back for season two if they graduated already?  Well, they're getting a little more help. 
[02:10:30]  But as I mentioned, Jeff Conaway is also dead.  He's died since then.  Aw.  You're kidding.  You had Gary Busey, who wasn't on anything.  He was just crazy, and he's still crazy.  Well, head injured.  Steven Adler, who's had noted relapses since celebrity rehab.  And Rodney King.  Oh, he's all right.  Yeah.  Right.  Rodney King's all right.  Can't we all just get along?  He's not doing well.  What?  He's fine, right?  He passed away.  He met with like an accident. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, no.  Jim's right.  He's dead.  He was at the bottom of his own pool, right?  Dead.  I love China.  Yeah?  Have you seen her porno?  I think you had a chance with her that one time.  I don't know.  You just didn't work it hard enough.  I didn't.  I was intimidated.  She's nuts.  You definitely had a chance with her.  Maybe I still could.  Eat that big pussy.  Ew.  Exactly.  Grab that clit with your fist and just pump on it.  Yeah, that's how they carried her out of the place.  You carry her like a fucking, like you're a runaway on a Charlie Brown cartoon.  A big clit over your shoulder. 
[02:11:30]  Over your shoulder.  Like a hobo.  We all like gum, but when you have too much gum in your mouth.  Oh.  But Jimmy likes a lot of gum in your mouth.  I really do.  I like that.  Yeah.  I like a lot of it.  It's a good way to put it.  Your jaw starts hurting.  Yeah.  Go ahead there, Sam.  Let's see.  Season three, moving on.  You had Heidi Fleiss, who has since been back to real rehab.  Oh.  Oh, actual rehab, not the TV rehab?  Oh, come on.  You're saying they're different.  After that, you had Tom Sizemore, who's apparently okay. 
[02:12:00]  We had him in here, but he was recently in the Insane Clown Posse's Big Money Rustlers.  Film.  I forgot that we had Tom Sizemore in.  How great was that day?  Yeah, he was great.  He was fucking Sizemore.  Yeah.  Fuck, I forgot about that.  He was a cool guy, man.  Bob Kelly was in.  How the fuck did Tom Sizemore fall from greatness?  That guy is such a good fucking actor.  That's because of his addiction.  He's in Big Money Rustlers.  Yeah, he was in bad shape.  I saw him in Sober House, I believe.  Yeah.  Mindy McCready, country star, who after getting out of celebrity rehab was hospitalized for 
[02:12:30]  a drug overdose.  Whoa.  And Dennis Rodman, who has recently been described by his financial advisor as an alcoholic,  but a sweet guy.  And Mike Starr was on season three.  Mike is doing good.  Thank God.  Which one's Mike Starr?  He's a musician.  Yeah.  He's still playing.  No.  He used to be in Alice in Chains.  Oh.  He's dead.  What?  Yeah, he's not playing.  He died.  Oh, man.  So he's dead.  How many people have died from Dr. Drew's shows? 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, a notable number, I'd say.  Three or four at this point?  Let me see.  Let me give you the exact number one.  Has Dr. Drew been indicted yet?  Because this really seems like somebody should file some charges.  I have to say.  And he's a really nice guy.  I don't fault Dr. Drew at all.  I really don't.  That's the odds.  That really is the odds.  And he just happens to be filming.  All he's showing you.  Is that really the odds, Jimmy?  Oh, dude, most people die.  Wow.  It's a depressing fact.  But most people do not make it sober.  Most people do not. 
[02:13:30]  The large majority relapses.  Damn.  Some come back.  Most don't.  And that's the way it is.  Does it scare you, Jim Norton?  It's eye-opening.  Because why?  Like, I'm no better than they are.  You don't have a desire to drink anymore, do you?  No, but I still think, like, occasionally, like, recently, because I haven't been going  to meetings.  I've been kind of dry drunk.  And I've been thinking about fucking...  What's dry drunk?  My attitude is shitty.  I'm not grateful.  Like, I'm not enjoying...  But you know what I mean?  It's about to...  It makes your attitude better.  It makes you feel better when you do certain sober things. 
[02:14:00]  I'm wet drunk.  That's what I do.  I wet myself.  You're swimming in a sea of poison.  But you know, most people relapse.  It's an unfortunate fact.  And most people don't make it.  So I wouldn't say I get strong urges.  But the thought will creep in once in a while.  And it's just my self-destructive thinking.  But I respect that.  I respect it a lot.  And I watch those people.  So you totally understand what's going on here.  Oh, fuck. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, man.  I know it.  God, this became real, Sam.  This was supposed to be a silly little bit about people dying.  No, but it is funny.  But he's just filming.  He literally is just filming famous people.  But that's the way it is for every rehab.  You'll get some great success rates.  But the reality is most people...  It just doesn't stick.  They just don't want it bad enough.  It's always them.  It's always the person.  You've got to have tremendous willpower, I would assume.  Or in a way realize you have zero. 
[02:15:00]  Like when it comes to that, I have zero willpower.  Like I had to give up.  Like I fucking can't touch any of it.  Like I can't do a little bit.  I fuck...  None of it.  You know what I mean?  You've got to just fucking completely throw in the towel.  The hardest part is realizing how bad it sucks not to drink.  Isn't that what they say?  The hardest part is...  I was for a while afraid that I would always think that.  Like be worried.  You know, of course you're worried.  Fuck, man. 
[02:15:30]  I bet.  And I only did it for a few years.  So I can imagine if someone's doing it for 20 years.  It's hard.  Oh, man.  Well, I guess we'll blow off the rest of the...  No, no, no.  I didn't mean to do that.  Keep going with the bit.  I was just...  What is that a stadium arena thingy for?  That's a fucking puppy show.  The what?  Beach volleyball.  Oh, it is?  Oh, maybe not.  Oh, that might be...  What the fuck is it?  It looks like gladiator.  Oh, horse head.  Oh, dressage.  What's dressage?  Dressage.  Ooh.  What does this mean?  The horses jump around, and they gotta prance, and they gotta look cool. 
[02:16:00]  They do this.  See?  They're going...  Brr-rooom.  Brr-rooom.  Brr-rooom.  Why does the athlete get all the credit?  The athlete...  I guess he had to train the horse.  I think the horse should get the medal, right?  Of course.  The horse is up there.  The horsey national anthem.  Brr-roo-roo-roo.  Brr-roo-roo-roo-roo.  Brr-roo-roo-roo-roo.  Brr-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo.  Brr-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo.  It really is.  Do you know, there's a very sexy domination porno called Dressage that I saw. 
[02:16:30]  There's a woman in Arizona named Dom Karen, I think her name is.  And she's been around for a long time.  I know Dom DeLuise.  Oh, gee, Willis.  Oh, what am I going to do with you?  Put you in a nut house already.  You're nutting a bunch of fruitcakes.  And there was a very sexy porno she did called Dressage.  And it was just sexy to me because she was always whipping and beating slaves. 
[02:17:00]  But in this one, I think it's her personal slave.  Like, she's got this guy and she tells the other woman, the other woman comes over and, like, sucks the guy's cock.  Whoa.  And it was really dirty because the woman is complimenting the guy's cock.  And it's so hot for me when two girls are talking and one compliments.  Really?  Like, cock, like, yeah.  Boy, you are really niche sometimes.  Because it's so dirty for a girl to say that.  Like, for a girl to say, like, wow, he's got a really big cock.  It's just so hot to hear a girl say something so dirty.  Oh.  Do you like hearing things you've never heard? 
[02:17:30]  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yes.  When a girl says that or I'm a fan of the show, it makes me come in my pants.  Yeah, dude, I do.  It's so dirty.  It's so dirty because I don't know why a girl saying that fucking drives me crazy.  Yeah.  Why would you go to a horse event like this?  I don't even know.  I don't know either.  People like horses.  That's some rich shit, I guess.  I'm sure, like, Shatner watches this and stuff.  That's a beautiful horse. 
[02:18:00]  It really is.  Yeah, but what is he doing?  It's like the arch of the neck, the fucking, the way it's prancing.  But how do you feed?  How do you tell a good horse from a bad horse?  Well, if the thing's just going around like a fucking crazy-ass horse.  Look, see, he's walking sideways.  That's got to be bad, right?  That's pretty good.  Sideways is bad or good?  No, that's good shit right there.  All right.  When you were in California, horse going sideways, good or bad?  That meant the fucking rattlesnake was next to you and the fucking thing was scared shitless.  You ever see a rattlesnake? 
[02:18:30]  Yes.  Live?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Not in a zoo?  Oh, fuck yeah.  In California, we used to see a lot of them.  Look at that.  It's doing that, like, hoppy thing.  This must sound really silly to a lot of people in this country, but really?  Tell me about rattlesnakes.  No, it was cool.  It was the first time I rode up with my new pistol.  I just got a pistol for my, like, 12th birthday or whatever it was.  Maybe 13.  You were carrying a gun at 12, 13?  Yeah, yeah.  It was great.  That's just amazing.  It's such a different world than I grew up in. 
[02:19:00]  I was barely allowed to have a 10-speed bike at that age.  I had to be home at 930, and I couldn't watch Clockwork Orange until I was 16 and having  couscous with mother.  Right.  With mother.  Mother.  And his dad just gives him a hooker and a gun.  Did he hear he said his new pistol, which means he had pistols before that?  Well, no.  I had shot my dad's pistol, but I never had my own pistol.  And this was a Ruger single 6 .22 pistol.  And it was fucking great.  And I got a low, tied-down holster for it and everything.  Gosh. 
[02:19:30]  And saddled up the horse and went up in the hills riding.  How did we get along most of these years with such different upbringings?  That's just it.  Got to have, like, a little variety.  Notice I said most.  Yeah.  There were a few bad ones in there.  Well.  Just fuck it up.  So what?  You have your new pistol?  Yeah, new pistol.  And I went riding up by a...  It was a pile of wood or something.  They love fucking, like, anything that's piled up with little nooks and crannies in it.  And the horse started getting real skittish at first before I even heard anything. 
[02:20:00]  And then you hear that, like, rattling.  It's trying to scare you away.  Wow.  And, of course, I couldn't leave well enough alone.  So I also had a Winchester 30-30 lever action.  And I took that out of the scabbard and I started poking the wood, the wood pile with it.  From the horse?  Yeah, from the top of the horse.  You were kind of leaning down.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then the snake just started coming out.  Wow.  The horse must have freaked out.  The horse did.  Wow.  That's exactly what it did.  It started moving sideways and turned its head, like, toward the snake, but its body 
[02:20:30]  was moving the other way.  And I was like, ho, ho, ho.  And then it got kind of far away.  She settled down and I grabbed the pistol and just started fucking firing rounds off at  the snake.  And that didn't frighten the horse?  No, the horse was great with noise.  That's weird, right?  Nightmare.  She was great with noise.  She didn't care.  I used to freak people out by popping balloons in front of her face and she would just,  like, stand there.  But she was crazy, like, not a real mellow horse. 
[02:21:00]  She was a real high-strung horse, but for some reason noise didn't bother her.  Did you hit the rattlesnake?  No.  No?  Not with the pistol.  I then used the rifle.  Oh, was that a tough shot?  Yeah.  Especially, like, I had just gotten the pistol and I'm on the top of a horse.  And you were 12, so.  And I'm fucking 13 or whatever it is.  Jesus.  But then I took the rifle out and I was able to hit the snake with the rifle.  And then I brought it back down.  And that's when I brought it down and I was like, yeah, I got a rattlesnake.  And my dad goes, yeah, with the amount of shots I heard you take, you could have bought  the skin. 
[02:21:30]  Oh.  You know, never quite satisfied.  A vision just popped in my head.  Something I forgot about.  But around the same age, I would guess, 12 or 13, my grandma for Christmas gave me one  of those, like, wooden rifles that shot rubber bands.  Oh.  But you could really fire a rubber band pretty hard.  I wasn't allowed to use it.  Why?  Why?  Because it was dangerous.  And we had a lot of kids in the house.  And I could have, like, you know, I can't beat her up for that. 
[02:22:00]  She was doing some parenting.  But my point is, this was a dumb, silly rubber band rifle type.  Yeah.  I mean, it would fly across the yard.  It was pretty impressive.  But it was a dumb rubber band.  He would shoot rubber bands?  Yeah.  Pretty hard.  I mean, you know.  He used to fuck your eye out.  He'll shoot your eye out, kid.  But that's the difference between us.  He had a real gun that was given to him.  I knew a guy named Peter who was sober.  I didn't know him when he was a kid.  But he had a fucking eye patch.  And when he was a kid, what happened was somebody was playing with an arrow and fucking  shot his eye out with an arrow. 
[02:22:30]  Oh.  Oh, fuck.  That's bad.  Oh.  Where did Sam go?  We're finishing up the Dr. Drew band.  He's running around.  Oh, look at him.  It doesn't matter that much.  But the point is, we brought it up because Bridget Nielsen was in that park with a bottle  of vodka rolling around like an idiot.  I wish I had that gun.  Really?  That gun.  Why'd you get it?  Well, my brother did a good thing.  He bought me the same type of gun.  That's cool enough.  For my birthday.  But I really would like that gun. 
[02:23:00]  How would you get it?  Oh, no.  Is it around you?  My father's wife has like all his old guns, unless she already sold them or something.  I don't know.  I would like like his .357 and that .22.  So why'd you ask for it?  I did.  She said no?  Yep.  But you're blood.  No, I'm not blood with her.  No, but you're blood with your old man.  Don't matter.  But she should have done the right thing for him.  She cried for maybe a month.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  And then hooked up with one of his friends. 
[02:23:30]  Ugh.  Oh, wow.  She won't give you the gun?  You don't like her?  No.  Fuck her now.  She won't give you the gun?  No.  When did you ask her?  A few years back.  And what'd she say?  No, I'm going to hold on to those.  They mean a lot to me.  What a fucking bitch.  He's your father.  Yeah, that's yours, man.  I could probably just call the cops and they take them because they're not registered or anything.  I think in a way those are yours.  I would think so, too.  What a fucking rotten, selfish woman.  That'd be kind of cool to have your dad's guns.  Does she want you to buy him? 
[02:24:00]  No, but I probably could have offered.  She might have even taken money.  I don't even know.  Why don't you just offer some dumb amounts of your house?  Why don't you buy one of them or whatever?  I haven't talked to her in fucking forever.  She'd probably be pissed at like, oh, you didn't keep in touch with me.  How long was she with your father?  They are.  You're good.  What?  She was with him from like fucking 1972 until like 90.  Until the end.  Four.  20 years or so.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a long ass time. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I would have, you know, I obviously would have liked him.  Oh, that would be kind of cool.  Yeah, man.  It would be cool.  Especially if you get that great.  Would you shoot them?  Oh, hells yeah.  You'd fire them, right?  Yeah, it would be fun.  Offer them money.  I remember shooting them years ago.  I would suck it up.  Believe it or not, that's coming from me.  Suck it up and just, you know, offer something that she can't.  Because again, she'll leave them to somebody who won't appreciate it.  Who will send them.  She's pretty old now.  Yeah.  She's born in like fucking, what?  39?  Give it $37.  40?  That's 60. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  No, that's 70.  No, I was doing the 60 part first.  Maybe later.  Maybe later.  Maybe a little later.  Maybe 40.  At 43, I would say.  1943.  That's 69.  We're not in any trouble with management, are we?  Yeah.  Why is he?  Why is he hovering?  Hovering?  He's talking to Kenny about travel.  About weather and stuff like that.  There's nothing to talk about.  Go back to your stupid office.  Oh, Jesus.  What else about Dr. Drew?  Are we done?  Just a couple more from season four. 
[02:25:30]  Season five is not even.  I mean, season four and season five is when they started bringing in people that weren't  even like, didn't even really have.  Well, they ran out of people.  Yeah.  They were willing to humiliate themselves on TV.  But season four, you had Jason Davis, who was that social.  He was a big fat guy.  Oh, yeah.  He was arrested for possession following.  Wait, was he the one who tried to get into the White House party?  Is that the guy with his chick that tried to get into the White House party?  No, no, no, no.  Jason used to hang out with Paris Hilton, and he was one of these kids that never had  to work a day in his life.  He was just a big party animal. 
[02:26:00]  I think his nickname was Gummy Bear or something like that.  Yeah, no.  Because he liked Gummy Bears?  Because he's a big fat guy.  And they basically told him he would be dead within a year or two.  His party was out of control.  I think I remember that.  Is he dead?  No.  He kind of turned it around for a little while there.  But he was arrested for possession after the show.  Is he a dick?  Yeah, yeah.  He's awful.  Spoiled rich kid?  Really spoiled.  Really bad.  Incredibly spoiled.  And Leif Garrett was arrested for heroin after his celebrity reunion. 
[02:26:30]  That's nice though.  He probably helped somebody, right?  Yeah.  No.  Heroin.  Oh.  And he paralyzed.  I just said heroism.  Let's not forget, he paralyzed his best friend, too.  Yeah.  Did he really?  Oh, God.  And then they met for the first time.  And you didn't see that behind the music or whatever the fuck it was called?  Where Leif Garrett shows up at a park and there's this friend he, you know, fucking paralyzed 
[02:27:00]  years prior and they were meeting for the first time in the park.  And the guy in the wheelchair is like, I forgive you.  I forgive you.  Oh, right.  Yeah, I remember that.  I finally forgive you.  It's brutal TV.  What does Leif do?  Thanks.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Makes it about him.  Like, oh, God, thank you.  I really needed that.  I know you don't have any legs or anything that work, but thank you.  I really needed that for me to go on with my life.  Now, what year did Leif paralyze him?  Nah, it was like in his heyday or whatever.  Oh, when he was a celebrity.  Yeah, when he had all the fast cars and shit. 
[02:27:30]  When he was pretty much a rock star, I think.  A rock star.  Could you find the clip?  That's got to be on YouTube.  Him crying with his friend?  Yeah.  The big meetup after years.  Because, you know, they avoided each other for a long time.  Yeah, find out what year that happened.  Because Leif Garrett was big in like 77, 78.  I think 79.  Is what Wiki said.  Oh. 
[02:28:00]  He's on Celebrity Rehab, right?  No, it wasn't on Rehab.  It was a VH1 thing.  They got him together for this weird reunion.  And the guy's in the park waiting for Leif to show up in his wheelchair.  Yeah, I remember that.  Brutal, man.  Felt bad for the guy.  I don't know if it's on.  Felt bad for him because Leif fucked him.  How is that not on the internet?  I mean, I'm sure it's somewhere.  Yeah, you have to look it upright.  You probably spell your Leif wrong.  You gotta just look it up.  L-E-A-F.  You gotta look it upright. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, you don't look anything upright.  I look some stuff upright.  No, pretty much nothing.  Well, I know some stuff.  That's not fair.  I gotta take a leak.  You'll find it good.  If not, who gives a fuck?  We gotta talk about Honey Boo Boo.  Oh, Jesus.  Gotta talk about Honey Boo Boo.  That lump of shit.  Who's Honey Boo Boo?  Oh, you're gonna find out who Honey Boo Boo is after the break.  Should we pee real quick?  I gotta pee again.  I gotta pee.  Take a little breaky.  And also, The Monster's got a reality show.  The Monster. 
[02:29:00]  The radio show?  That's what we used to call them.  Oh, the Marvel.  On TLC.  The Monsters.  Oh, right.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Well, we'll talk about that.  I think they got like a preview clip or something that's just...  Yeah.  It's just unbelievable.  It's the two-headed girl.  Two-headed girl.  Where they have two heads, two arms, two legs.  And they gotta figure out how to work together just to walk.  The two-headed girl.  Oh, right.  Yes, yes, yes.  We've done hours on these girls over the years. 
[02:29:30]  Yes.  Let's do it.  I'm desperate.  Now they're in college.  Okay.  We haven't talked about them in so long that they're now graduating college, Anthony.  Can't wait.  So we got the preview clip.  We'll do that next, too.  Stay there.  Live read.  Is everybody ready to laugh?  This is going to be fucking good.  Just turn it on, though.  I'll turn the mic on.  Okay.  There's only a handful of online dating sites where you can actually meet women who just want to bang the top of that list. 
[02:30:00]  Cougalife.com.  Girls, they don't want to fuck your brains out.  There's over two million women.  Cougalife cornered the market on single moms and stuff.  They're single because they're not double.  They're stuck at home because they're, like, on glue traps or something.  Well, there are recent divorces.  And they're desperate for some peters.  So stick your pecker in one of these girls. 
[02:30:30]  Because according to a recent study that I did, women in their 40s are five times more likely to let you stick your pecker in them on the first date than women in their 20s.  My mother always said, Chip will always date an older woman because they know what they want.  And then I would rub oil into her.  She always had very swollen calves and ankles.  She would need lotion rubbed into them.  My mother was a cougar.  Think of all the single moms or recent divorcees out there who haven't had a date in years. 
[02:31:00]  They ain't been fucked in a long time.  My mother never met anyone after my father went on his sales job.  She would just have guys come over and help her fix the floorboards.  But they wasn't fucking her.  So where do all these women go to fucking frolic?  Cougalife.com or something.  So instead of wasting your time being teased by these uptight bitches who just say things like,  You're ugly, chipper.  Get away from me, chipper.  I don't want to have sex with you, chipper.  Go to Cougalife and see if you can break my personal record of fucking 30 cougars in 30 days. 
[02:31:30]  Stuck it in every hole.  Mouth, pussy, butt.  Mouth, pussy, butt.  Mouth, pussy, butt.  And then I switched the order.  And they were like, Chipper, your big peck is hurting me.  I'm like, my mother always told me I had a bigger bulge than most boys my age.  Try Cougalife for free or something.  See why it was voted the wildest dating service in America.  Three years in a row.  It wouldn't mean nothing if it was only two years.  But I'm Chip Chipperson and I'm telling you, I've stuck my big pecker in a lot of cougars from Cougalife.com. 
[02:32:00]  I fuck them so hard that they go, oh, chipper, that was a hard fuck.  Serious, serious accents.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ooh, a green drink. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, you're going to like that one.  I'm taking, oops, we got our beverages.  Juice generation rules.  Yes.  Let's not plug all of it.  I'm buying this today.  Yeah, I paid for this.  I've never gotten a free juice.  I hate beets, but I'm drinking beets, carrot, spinach, and I'm missing one, beets, celery, maybe.  You got the Mr. Green jeans. 
[02:33:00]  I love it.  It makes you shit, though.  Like, beets make me shit.  You are gearing up for a great flight.  Aha!  Kenny, oh no.  Oh, no.  Kenny?  I have the information Anthony requested.  Oh, how far is it?  Wait, what did you request?  I need to know where a certain utility is, an establishment.  Ah.  From here?  How far?  Yes.  It is a men's bathhouse.  Jimmy is familiar with this establishment.  He frequents there also. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, I was kidding, but you're right.  Okay.  Yes.  Yes.  So I tap my feet under the stall?  No, all you got to do is, what you do is, you look through the fucking hole in the  stall, and your eye gets really bigger, and you wink, and they go, ah.  So I go, psst.  Yeah.  I remember one time I was jerking off in a booth.  It was fucking so gross.  I saw two big fucking black lips and a fucking long tongue, and I was fucking so turned off.  Oh, God damn.  Wrecked my jerk. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  I don't doubt it.  Yeah.  I was dying to suck some dick.  I had a fucking amp-scrayed out of there.  I made like a tree and left.  I made like a sheep and got the flock out of there.  That guy wanted my fucking young.  Just did a set in South Jersey, cock in his mouth.  He wasn't getting it.  It was a real cock softener.  Yeah.  Yes.  I won't be fucking any Negroes.  Oh.  How far, Ken?  How far?  Two and a half city blocks. 
[02:34:30]  Damn, that's too far.  One, two and a half.  2.5, Kenny.  You say it like millennium.  That's not bad.  I'm not metric.  In a half city block.  You should leave now, then.  Well, I got to leave after the show.  After the show.  We have plenty of time.  All right.  I got to go to the same establishment.  Will it work?  Well, your assistant should be here shortly.  Oh.  So maybe you could delegate.  I don't know if this could be delegated.  Oh. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  I mean, it's like, what's your assistant going to do?  Go get.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  The fucking.  Really?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Right down the throat.  Wow.  Ant's doing the signal.  He's trying to be discreet, but he's pumping like a big dick into his mouth signal.  And he's got both hands open really wide.  That throws me under the bus because I said, wow.  Wow.  Well, no, you were impressed.  You're not gay, but you were impressed that Ant could take so much.  Don't jump to conclusions, Jim.  It's amazing.  I'm 44 years old. 
[02:35:30]  And the first place my mind goes is the Ant's going to suck a prick.  And like, that's the big joke.  You know me.  But I mean, it's fucking.  Your whole career has been working up to this moment.  Dude.  A big fucking sucking of the prick joke.  Like Colin would have some ironic point.  You know, I guess that's what they do in Ron Conk.  I didn't have a very funny, real observation.  And I just go right to the cock.  That's funny, Jimmy.  I'm okay, but I'm.  Let's go to TLC and look at this new show the Monsters are doing.  The Monsters are these two girls. 
[02:36:00]  We've been following them since they were very.  Hold on there.  Since they were very, very little.  Yes.  Basically, it's one body with two heads.  But like the left, the left head like controls the left arm and the left leg and the right  head controls the right arm and the right leg.  What are their names?  Abigail, I think is one.  Yeah.  Abby and Brittany.  Oh, Abby.  Abby and Brittany.  Abby and Brittany.  They have two heads and then their shoulders are very wide.  Right.  But then it all melds together into one body. 
[02:36:30]  So they have one vagina.  By the time you get past the boobs, the rest of the lower half is pretty much a normal looking  body.  One asshole.  One vagina.  Right.  Two tits.  Over the years, we've seen them jump in a pool and swim.  We've seen them ride a bike.  Oh, yeah.  Just weird shit.  Yeah, it's crazy.  And now they're graduating college.  Who's going to hire a two-headed monster? 
[02:37:00]  Jesus.  But who is?  The funniest part of that was that it was a genuine question.  Yes.  But I mean, you know how many college graduates are still looking for work and, you know.  But think of it.  You are getting two heads for the person.  But how does that work?  And do you have to pay them?  Thank you.  These are the questions that no one asks.  How does it work?  If they get a job, do you have to pay both?  Yeah, answer these questions on your dumb show.  When you fucking get boyfriends, how do you work that out?  If each head gets a separate boyfriend, do they both get the same boyfriend? 
[02:37:30]  Do they both feel the vagina when it's getting fucked?  Yes.  That's what I want to know.  Dude, that's so weird.  If they're taking a shit, like there's one go, ugh, that stinks, and the other one likes  it.  And we did the whole rape thing.  If one of the girls really likes a guy, but the other girl doesn't like the guy, is she  being raped while the other one's making love?  Yeah.  Does the right hand feel what always the left hand is doing?  Like, do they literally just, is it the same as you and I feel, but there's just two heads  thinking?  It's so weird.  I remember over the years when we've done shit on these two, they said they had to learn 
[02:38:00]  to walk together.  Yeah, yeah.  They got it down now.  Well, that doesn't make sense.  Well, because they're separate.  The body parts have.  They're controlled separately.  But then how the fuck do you know when to walk?  Can the left feel the right?  They just know.  They figured it out.  And so long.  It's like second nature at this point.  Now they just walk, yeah.  You can hold hands with a chicken, you can hold hands with a girl, and when you start,  you're walking, like, you're always off step, like, you know, left, left, right,  and left, right, right, left.  And it's like always a jumpy start until you both synchronize your steps. 
[02:38:30]  Right.  They figured that out at a young age, that's all.  Like Jim Norton, I'm a horrible sleeper.  Can you imagine, like, you have another head on your body, and they don't feel like falling  asleep yet?  And it's got apnea.  You sleep well, but fucking, you know, throat polyps, McGillicuddy next to you.  Fucking breath.  That breath in your face all the time.  All the time.  All the time.  How the fuck does all this shit work?  But I wonder if it smells like your breath, or if you identify it as someone else's breath.  They are two distinctly different personalities. 
[02:39:00]  Well, hopefully a lot of this will be answered, because finally, TLC has given them a show.  They should have given them a show years ago.  Of course.  They finally have a show.  But they're graduating college and, you know, going out into the real world.  Let me see them, Sam.  Is that back when you're watching TV at home?  Okay.  Is this the official trailer for the show, Sam?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's play it.  Hello.  Hi, man.  I'm Brittany.  Oh, boy.  I control the right side, and I control the left side.  Yeah.  We were controlling.  No.  Did we know that? 
[02:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  We definitely compromise, because we have to.  One, two, three.  Oh.  I just thought, what is life like for them?  Everywhere they go, they get the stares.  I just don't know how they do that every day.  We throw it out there.  Let it go.  Abby and Brittany premieres August 28th at 10th, following the return of 19 kids and counting.  Only on TLC.  I'll see.  They went from 18 and 19?  Yeah, be a bitty.  Wow.  We're so watching this show. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, I'm in.  I'm all in with that one.  There's nothing really wrong with them, except for the obvious.  What?  The fact that they're fucking...  They got a good person out.  Not like the other two.  They're not nearly as bad as the ones who sing country, and the one has to be wheeled along.  They're like a giant crab mess.  That's what I'm trying to say.  Oh, God.  These two are normal besides the obvious.  Just a fucking...  The other two-headed monster.  Remember the one liked short hair, the other one liked long hair, the one liked her hair  dyed, the other one didn't?  Yeah.  They were just a mess. 
[02:40:30]  Oh, just singing country.  And the one was on a gurney while the other one was doing her country music career.  They had different songs, though.  The Hat Next Door to Me.  Bought by my sister.  The Hat.  Or in the same hat.  The Hat About Hats.  That one was way worse, because the one sister had to do all the work.  And their heads were stuck together.  Sideways.  So they had, like, fucking weird crease in there.  How are you going to cut that hair in there?  Yeah, I don't think these two...  It starts at the neck, basically, right?  Yeah.  They have, like, two separate necks. 
[02:41:00]  So they have two separate spinal cords?  Or partly?  Their spine goes into...  Yeah, their neck goes into a spine.  And I think it's double spine.  But they're right next to each other.  The whole way down.  Really?  Unless it goes, like, right to maybe...  No, I think it's maybe right before the pelvis.  Her spine goes back into the right...  They have two hearts, I remember.  How many lungs?  Double spine.  How many lungs?  I know they have two hearts.  I remember that from our past discussions. 
[02:41:30]  Two hearts.  Wow, do they really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's two hearts in there.  It's really wide up top, and then it comes down.  Yeah, it's like a...  Oh, sure.  Like a V.  I really wonder, though, if they...  Like, can the girl on the left feel the right arm moving, or is she observing it moving?  Like, if they have two spines, does that mean their central nervous system is...  I don't think they can feel it.  Can you feel it?  I mean, it's...  I don't think she can.  No, I think her right arm is somewhere in the middle of her sister's back. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, God.  How weird is that?  I don't know.  It's fucked up.  How do they sleep?  I would ask them how they go to the bathroom, but I would really want to know how they sleep.  Do you sleep on your back?  You can't toss and turn.  They've got to sleep on their back or on their stomach.  You know when you've got to adjust yourself when you're sleeping?  Yeah.  You can't do that.  But they're used to it.  Or does that all happen just kind of naturally in a weird way?  They're used to it with two fucking heads.  It's all you know?  Yeah, I guess that's true.  So they can sleep on their stomach or their back.  Is it true a lot of these Siamese twins, they don't want to be separated after a point? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, there's no separating that.  No, obviously.  That's hilarious.  Just one head.  Well, the famous Siamese twins, that was an easy operation.  Yeah.  Ing and Chang.  Ing and Chang.  Ing and Chang.  Fang.  Wait, they were barely together.  They had just a small thing, right?  There was a small thing of skin on their chest.  On their chest.  That was it.  That was it.  They could have ripped themselves apart.  Was that the only skin?  Yeah, that was an easy one.  Can you look them up, too?  Now they're doing incredibly complicated surgeries to separate these Siamese twins. 
[02:43:00]  But I wonder if back then they just didn't know if they were going to die.  Like, those two Asian twins.  Look them up.  The Siamese guys.  I wonder if back then they were just scared of it.  Like, even though that's all you know.  Yeah.  Yeah, the surgery wasn't up to speed.  Yeah, they, you're like, what would I look at?  You're so used to just looking at this guy.  There they are.  Chang and Ing.  See, yeah, because of what they're wearing, it looks like they're connected by a lot more.  But in the end, they really weren't.  Did they have two separate, oh, go, go, go, Sam, go to the picture in the bottom right.  Go back before I fire you. 
[02:43:30]  Okay, no, there you go.  Yeah, see.  See.  Did they have right arms and left arms?  Yeah.  Yeah, they did.  They were just connected at the chest.  Like, right at the breast bone.  But that was it.  Like, they could have separated them.  They were the most famous ones.  Wow.  They made it look like they were a lot more connected.  I wonder if they liked being who they were.  They did.  I'm sure they had fame because of it.  We in the show business.  Very good.  But do they have two legs?  They had two legs?  Like noodles left too long and bold. 
[02:44:00]  See, they stick together.  They kind of just had a little...  It's weird.  It's kind of, we're just, I don't know, they kind of had a rope.  That's so fucking weird.  They could both walk and everything.  It was really, that one was, it was just, they just didn't know how to do it yet.  It's weird that they, they knew they could be separated and they stayed.  Like, what the fuck?  Getting back to the two newer ones.  Yeah, go to the newer ones.  Like, obviously they're at that age.  I mean, at the very least they want to be masturbating. 
[02:44:30]  How does that work?  Oh, man.  They both share, they share a fucking vagina.  But how weird would that be?  Pretty weird.  I guess you're...  And are you both feeling it?  Right, what are you thinking of?  Maybe one only feels the vagina.  I don't know.  Oh, I hope not.  Because the other one's like, what are you doing?  Like, she has no idea.  No idea why you're doing it.  Yeah, why would you put, why are you putting that thing in there?  Making her leg all wet?  Yeah.  Why are you touching that smelly thing?  Oh, God.  I don't want to shave it.  I do.  She just knows it as a smelly thing.  That's it to her. 
[02:45:00]  And if one, like, becomes a whore and the other one's a prude.  Yeah, all that shit.  Like, the whore wants to just fuck all the time.  See, but what about...  I would probably rather date one of the two country chicks.  Can we look at them?  Oh, God.  The one in the fucking rollers.  You just fucking throw a blanket over the other one and you eat her ass while she's  fucking rolling.  Eat her ass.  That's all you do while she's fucking rolling.  There's the country music.  Oh, what a disaster they are. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, but at least there's a fucking separate body.  Those two.  Oh, man.  The other one, you just throw a sheet on her.  If you were, like, part of a Siamese twin thing and your other half died, would you just  take a hatchet and start hatching away?  Oh, just hack it.  Knowing that it's a matter of time that you're going to die, too, because of this shit.  Would you give it a shot?  You know how hard it would be if you're trying to have your other head killed and you're  trying to write a rant, like, a fucking note to someone while they're asleep?  What are you writing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  No, it said something about when it's sleeping.  Could you... 
[02:46:00]  No, no, no, no.  It's just...  I'm just wearing one of some poetry.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, if you're mad at each other, you'd have to deal with that crap.  They're a disaster.  Do they argue?  Do they...  Do twins like that?  I guess they do.  Human beings just argue.  So you've got to think eventually, yeah.  And then you just can't get away from the person.  And does the one have a bad neck ache?  Oh, that...  It looks painful just to always have that head fucking...  And they know when...  Because they probably have such an intuitive sense for each other.  Oh, yeah.  They probably know when one is angry at the other. 
[02:46:30]  They talk at the...  They speak at the same time a lot, a lot of the times.  From the commercial, you can see, like, they're saying the same thing at exactly the same time.  That's all women, though.  That's just all women.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  I mean, what women actually wait for each other?  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  All they do is fucking yip and yap.  I want to see these...  Show me the young girls.  Maybe they've got to, like, say, all right, look, let's flip for it.  I'll get the pussy, you get the asshole. 
[02:47:00]  So, like, the husband or boyfriend of one just gets the pussy and the other one gets the ass.  Oh, God.  It's like, sorry, got what a set of tits on her.  You can tell the one head doesn't belong there as much as the other head.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I wonder if that's a problem, too.  The one on the right definitely is the extra head.  The one on the right really doesn't belong there as much.  No, it's kind of growing out of the shoulders.  And I bet you the one on the left knows that and is bothered by that.  It's like, I'm the fucking...  I drive this thing.  You're just a passenger.  You think in the morning she kind of closes one eye to see what it would look like without 
[02:47:30]  her sister?  Imagine what it would look like without this burden on my shoulder.  You know, I think I could do that.  You know, I think I could...  I think this should be my body.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wonders, like, the one sister wonders why she's always waking up with a pillow over her face.  Oh, man.  I thought I just tossed it in turn and I must have done that again.  What if you just started punching the shit out of the one?  Like, you wouldn't feel it, but you just punch the face.  Right.  You just keep punching her in the fucking face.  There must be a certain faith you bring.  Yeah, cover up the right head.  All right.  Cover up the right head.  What are you doing?  Just use your hand. 
[02:48:00]  Something.  Yeah, keep...  Oh, no.  Oh, Sam.  Did you think it was gonna...  Oh, Sam.  Did you think it was gonna...  You can't do that.  I can't cover it on...  It's two monitors.  Just use a piece of paper or something.  On yours?  Yeah.  I can't reach over there.  Oh, boy.  Please.  Now he doesn't know what to do.  I just want to see...  Oh, what do we look like?  He's struggling.  He's struggling.  Just her head, though.  Just her head.  Leave her shoulder in there.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Now turn this way.  Oh, man.  Look at her one...  She's still a mess.  Oh, my God.  But she could fucking live that way.  But her one shoulder's, like, way off to one side.  Yeah, there's gotta be something there. 
[02:48:30]  Otherwise, it would just be real estate.  There's enough room there for a head.  Yeah.  That's why there's room, yeah.  It looks...  Yeah, the other one.  Like, yeah.  Oh, uh, uh, see now.  They both just look like lopsided, big-shouldered idiots.  No, the other one could pull it off more than the other, is what I'm getting at.  She could just carry a small child on that one shoulder.  Yeah, or do anything.  Big seat.  Put a hump on it and ring a bell.  A fucking barrel of beer.  Yeah, they think she was just a big party animal.  Ah, here she is again.  More beer.  What else is new? 
[02:49:00]  You know?  Just constantly carry a suitcase or something.  A suitcase up there.  Up there.  A knapsack.  Something.  A duffel bag.  Something heavy.  Your laundry.  No, I'm just bringing the laundry.  Tire.  Laundromat.  Anything.  There's just no reason.  Well, make sure the guys get audio of this show every week.  What are the odds of what we gotta stay close to?  How old are they?  They're just graduating, so 22.  All right, I would be respectful, because they...  I mean, that is kind of a rough way to live. 
[02:49:30]  But I want to know...  Oh, my God.  If we had them in the studio, we'd be so respectful.  I'd be very nice.  I wouldn't ask dirty questions.  But I would love to ask stuff about sleeping and snoring and just, like, bad breath.  Eating?  Eating!  Do they share a stomach, and how does that work?  They both obviously get sick together.  If one is the cold...  Like, do you ever sneeze in her face?  Right.  But how do they eat?  Because it looks like they share a stomach, so...  They have the same culinary tastes.  No!  It's funny.  I like bland, and she likes spicy! 
[02:50:00]  You know that shit goes on.  Oh, all the time.  Where they try to make you believe that they are separate.  And then the one says, I like spicy.  The other one's like bland.  It's like, I have to pay.  My asshole has to suffer because of what she's eaten.  They just give, like, really ruthless examples.  Yeah, this one likes cocks and not always white ones.  And then she winks at us.  And the other one pretends not to hear it because it's rude to each other.  You just gotta fucking...  You share everything with another person.  Yeah.  There's not one...  Moment of privacy. 
[02:50:30]  There's not one moment of just quiet reflection alone.  No.  I wonder if they do anything to give each other privacy in relationships.  Like...  Like turn their head?  Or put something over their head.  A bag over their head.  Yeah, maybe a little provider.  It's your privacy bag.  Yeah, it's a privacy...  Put on your privacy bag.  They built a privacy box, and it's got, like, a fucking little TV monitor in it.  So they can watch TV with their headphones on.  Yeah, so they don't hear it.  While the other one's taking three cocks.  A privacy box.  You know what?  They just might, though.  You never know. 
[02:51:00]  How do they grant each other privacy?  Right.  What is...  Because privacy is important to humans.  I guess shitting for them is just a thing they have to do.  Together.  Because I...  They have one asshole.  Yeah.  But who decides it's time to shit?  Dude, I guess...  How does this...  When they feel a rumble, and they probably go, yeah, I'm feeling it.  You want to see a long picture of them, Sam?  I want to see a longer picture.  You know, the jokes are easy, obviously.  I've been up there a long time, though.  The jokes are easy, but these questions is what I would really like to ask.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you've got to shit.  Who decides that?  Why are you just putting conjoined twins in there and not their names? 
[02:51:30]  Because I didn't have their names on me, and I thought since they were in the news,  they would come up.  But why wouldn't you, Sam?  Really?  Sam is just a fucking bitch when it comes to this stuff.  You can't criticize him.  He gets all fucking pissy.  He really doesn't know how to handle...  Man up, cunt.  A little...  I don't know if that's going to help him.  I was going to say bitch, but it wasn't strong enough.  Troy's the bitch.  Oh, shit.  40-year-old bitch.  All right, there's...  Oh, my God.  Now, turn that, Sam.  Look at how wide they are. 
[02:52:00]  Wow.  They are wide.  They definitely have two spines.  Yeah, but there are girls out there that don't have two heads that are that wide.  Oh, wider, yeah.  But it looks like you have to have two heads there.  Like, there really are two people.  Like, you said, the two spines.  You'd have to have a really wide cock to get in between those tits.  Oh, man, right?  Oh, a titty fuck, that would be impossible.  But they are kind of like...  They almost look like a room corner where they kind of cave in on each other.  You think they have a lot of conversations around corners? 
[02:52:30]  The one sister just stays behind.  Yeah.  Don't come any closer.  She's trying to be all coy because she's hiding the other head.  Now, their legs aren't bad.  Oh, God.  They're so far apart.  What's with the pussy?  That's got to be weird because there's too much room there.  You think?  Yeah.  Maybe they got two.  Maybe they got two.  Jeez.  Maybe they got two.  And I'll tell you something.  That would make sense.  No one has asked them that.  No.  That's the problem.  Do you have two? 
[02:53:00]  Nobody has asked these guys or these girls if...  Do you guys have one vagina or two?  Well, this picture of them in shorts.  They probably have one.  I don't know.  I never noticed this before, but they are a little wide in the vagina area.  They're pretty wide there.  It looks like there's a possibility there could be two.  Go to a bathing suit shot.  Is there a bathing suit shot or no?  It's horrific.  Imagine you have, like, fucking the one vagina that, like, is for your chick.  And then you're like, all right, I'm just going to slip it in here.  And you slip it in the other one.  She gets all pissed because you're cheating. 
[02:53:30]  You're cheating an inch away.  Imagine they go to a clothing store and they pick out something they both really like and  then they take it to the tailor and go, okay, make this fit us.  Make this fit our two heads and our giant back.  Next thing you know, the tailor's hanging himself.  Why don't you put in, Sam, put in internal anatomy of Abby and Brittany so we can see if they  have two spots.  Like, what is it?  Is that it? 
[02:54:00]  It's like a bathing suit shot.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That's them.  Yeah.  So, what does it say about vaginas?  Uh, one bladder, one set of reproductive organs.  One bladder, that's what we have.  One too many.  They've got three kidneys, two stomachs, one small intestine, one...  And a pot.  One set.  And a head crooked on some long shoulders.  On the second day of my nightmare, nature gave to me two busted spines, one leaky pussy, 
[02:54:30]  one sharply sore asshole, and two legs that don't work together well at all.  Two far apart tits.  Two crinkly arms, one long shoulder, and another head that I want to snuff out.  Twelve days of my nightmare. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, my God.  After the second horrified look on the doctor's face, nature gave to me...  My useless wife gave to me...  A disappointment in a baby bonnet.  In two baby bonnet.  Oh, that hurts.  I'm sorry.  Give more facts, Sam.  Give more facts.  And I got breaking news on these two. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah?  It's like a horse.  It's one set of reproductive organs.  One set of reproductive organs.  Oh, no.  But two stomachs.  So they do one smelly pussy.  And a head that is a size queen.  And three kidneys.  Three kidneys.  Oh, man.  What happened to the fourth kidney?  Yeah, how come the other kid doesn't have two legs?  And that's a bit selfish.  A lot of people out there need kidneys.  Why wouldn't they give up one?  They still would have two.  Maybe they need three.  Yeah.  We got Nader in Virginia. 
[02:56:00]  Nader.  Hi.  It's actually Nadir.  Nadir.  Oh.  Hi, Nadir.  How are you?  Hi.  How are you doing?  Have you guys heard of the Hilton twins, Daisy and Violet?  No.  They were in the movie Freaks.  Are you a gay guy?  Yes, I am gay.  Are you a guy or a girl?  No disrespect.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  How the fuck did you pull that out of your ass?  Because it sounds like...  It's not you.  It sounds like the Jay Leno kid.  Oh, Ross Matthews.  Ross.  Yeah, look at the Hilton twins. 
[02:56:30]  I had this as a girl.  No way.  No, it's obvious.  I'm a guy.  No, no, I know.  I'm just saying that you sound more like a girl.  And you've called before.  Do you have like tiny testicles?  No, I don't.  Well, why the voice like that?  What's your name?  I don't know how I sound.  This is Michaela from Philly?  No, this is Nadir.  Oh.  How did you say it again?  Nadir.  Nadir.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay.  Did you know you were gay at like one month?  You had to, right?  Where's the rattle?  Oh, shit. 
[02:57:00]  Well, you realize...  And the pacifier.  And the fucking mobile.  And some of the crib bars.  We got to go get more baby bottles.  All right.  How come that baby oil is half gone?  Oh, well.  Oh, Jesus.  Why is the voice high?  We're trying to learn on the show.  I'm a tenor.  What?  I'm a tenor.  Yeah, well, I'm a 12-un.  I'm a fucking home run, Chippison.  All right.  So what do we got? 
[02:57:30]  We're looking up the Hilton Siamese twins.  Why?  Yeah, um...  Apparently, like, one of them was, like, engaged to somebody.  Uh-huh.  Um...  How old are the Hilton sisters?  Oh, they're dead.  Yeah, that's a whole long...  That's a whole shit right there.  Oh, okay.  They look like the twins from The Fucking Shining.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Yeah, this Siamese twins thing is weird.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Um, it's creepy, and it just seems...  I don't... 
[02:58:00]  It's fascinating, is what I would say.  Do you like playing Siamese twins connected by the foreskin?  Do you pretend you're twins and that you have to kiss to survive?  How old, uh, gentlemen are you?  22.  22.  What's up?  So you're young, getting out...  Oh, man.  Yeah!  What are we doing for this?  Are you serious?  Are you serious?  Tyson!  Hey, we gotta say goodbye to you.  Fuck that.  Davey and Violet, they stuck together? 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, they're Siamese twins.  Holy, holy shit.  What a surprise this is.  What was the Japanese guy that was sitting together?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We were just showing them.  They were connected by the chest.  But they had a lot of children, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can you imagine the bed?  He's with one wife, and he's with the other, and they both going to stroke out.  Stroke out.  We're trying to figure out how you do that shit, you know?  You know how you guys were shocked.  Because they got that new show now with these two girls.  They have, like, two heads, but one body, and we're wondering, like, how they handle 
[02:59:00]  the sex.  The one stomach?  One vagina, one...  No, get out.  Swear.  One vagina, Mike Tyson, who's in the studio.  Holy shit.  Unbelievable.  Just walk right in.  I told you, guys, I was going to bring a nice cool...  You are the shit.  Thank you.  Jesus, dude.  Mike, we've been trying to talk to you for years.  Oh, man.  I love Who Kid.  Who Kid's the most non-threatening black motherfucker I've ever heard.  I love him.  You know, you're going to meet with him, you know you're all right with some white people.  Yeah, Who Kid.  Yeah, Who Kid's all right, man.  You can't get any water to me, man. 
[02:59:30]  I'm so glad someone is saying that.  Who Kid's the American dream right there.  Hell yeah.  Non-threatening.  Holy shit.  What the hell?  Mike Tyson, you got a play going on in Broadway?  Yes, I do.  I'm 48th and Broadway, the Longacre Theater.  What's this about?  I saw it last night, and I can tell you, it's fucking awesome.  It's about me.  Awesome.  Wait, you went last night?  I went last night, and I saw it.  Nice.  Thank you very much.  It's hilarious.  Right.  It's not meant to be hilarious.  This is not no fun.  I'm not no damn stand-up, but I'm just explaining some shit I went through. 
[03:00:00]  Right.  You know, and life is funny.  To us laymen, that's pretty funny shit, like some of the stuff you went...  Of course, it was probably painful at the time, some of it.  Oh, at the time, I wanted to commit suicide, motherfucker!  No shit, right?  You know, I'll tell you why it was funny.  Because the way you explained it, and the way you went through it was so natural.  I felt like this is what it sounds like if you're hanging out with Mike Tyson, and he's  telling you these stories.  It didn't feel performed or forced.  It felt very genuine.  Very natural.  It was very, very honest.  Great, man.  Well, that's why it was undisputed. 
[03:00:30]  It had to be true, you know?  Because if people out there that know the truth, and if it's not true, they're going to  come up and say, hey, I was dead, motherfucker.  Who's going to say that to you?  I know, right?  I'm doing something wrong.  He was made for this show.  I know, right?  Tyson was made for this show.  Whose idea was this to come up with the play?  Well, me and my wife, we went to witness Chaz Palminteri.  Amazing, right?  And, man, we watched this stuff.  I'm like, oh.  And just like my show with different emotions and stuff. 
[03:01:00]  And I said, I can do this.  Because this is basically what I do when I'm in Europe and Asia.  You go up there, but not as detailed as Chaz was.  You know, I go up there and they talk about you.  I talk about my life.  And, you know, this happened.  But normally when I did this stuff, I'm always high.  I was going through my high season.  You know what I mean?  High season.  It was my high season.  So I'm always high, sweating like a pimp with one hole up there.  I'm just sweating like buckets of water.  And so now I'm clean.  So I'm telling my wife, hey, baby, I can do this and stuff. 
[03:01:30]  And my wife is the entrepreneur business person.  Okay, let's do it.  So we meet this guy, Adam Stuck, that does, you know, men down under and all the hunks from, you know, from Australia.  Right.  And human nature.  So he said, let's make a show.  And then we did the show in Vegas for a week.  It was a sold-out crowd for a week.  And then Spike Lee got in touch with us and wanted to do what the Newland did on Broadway.  And I said, wow, we're getting ready to go on a world tour in little basements and stuff.  And then they said, yes, you really do.  And then it's Broadway.  And I'm just very grateful.  And that's what I'm trying to convey, like, a lot of gratitude.  I'm just really grateful. 
[03:02:00]  I can't wait to see the show.  I didn't know you were going last week.  I only got one ticket.  They had one ticket, and I went.  And it was fucking so good.  Because the stuff, like, I saw the documentary that James Toback did, right?  Which was amazing, by the way.  And it didn't feel like a retread of that.  It was like everything had a different angle than that.  So I didn't feel like, well, I saw this already.  It was amazingly different.  But I explained during my introduction that I know you saw James Toback, but I was in rehab.  And I was really dark stuff because I'm hot. 
[03:02:30]  I still got dope in my system.  And I'm just going to let you pull me in the head.  It's going to be a lot lighter tonight, you know?  And it was.  But it felt very honest.  You didn't once feel like, hey, there's a guy giving me a performance.  That's why I loved it.  It's like, this is what it feels like to hear you tell these stories for real.  No, but they got to hurry up because the last show was Sunday.  So you better hurry the fuck up, man.  Let me tell them where it is.  Why such a short run?  Donald Trump came.  50 Cent came.  A lot of people.  Jim Norton came.  Jimmy. 
[03:03:00]  He's a biggie.  Jim Norton.  Ain't Norton.  Ain't Norton.  I did a Norton impersonation too.  I did some Ralph Crams and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  You did do a good Crams and Lime.  Yeah, I did some Ralph.  Oh, it's coming at you, buddy.  It's coming.  We met years ago.  You don't remember.  I was hosting the Porno Awards, and you were on the, uh...  I'm not like that anymore, guys.  No, it's years ago.  He just gave you some love.  It was a long time ago.  It's many years ago.  I was really big in the porn world back then.  Back then.  Back then.  A long time ago.  You know, social event. 
[03:03:30]  Mike, do you consider yourself like the same person you are now?  Like the sense of humor and the gratitude and appreciation for what you have and what people do with you and for you as you were back then?  Or are you...  It's funny you say that.  Hilarious.  No.  No, I don't really funny.  You say, back then, I took myself too serious.  Yeah?  I thought you couldn't make fun of yourself if you were going to be a world conqueror.  Genghis Kong didn't make jokes around him.  I didn't understand...  I didn't understand all the fighting. 
[03:04:00]  I didn't understand this is how you get this accomplished.  You know?  And I would have...  Oh, man.  I wish I was that way.  Well, I ask that because there is such a distinction between that Mike Tyson and who we've grown to know,  at least through, you know, your performances and movies and interviews now.  It seems like a very different person.  You seem a lot happier and in a better place now.  Well, I'm not as desperate as I was back then for glory as I am now.  But isn't that part of being a great boxer is you kind of have to have that desperation for glory, right? 
[03:04:30]  Well, it's part of becoming a great anything.  Anything, yeah.  But great doesn't necessarily mean good.  You know, so you're getting a lot of troubles going because I know a lot of great people, but not all of them are good people.  Right, yeah, yeah.  So I'm trying to interact with that stuff.  You know what I mean?  I'd rather be remembered as being good because you're only a person for a small income at a time.  Right.  You know, you're an athlete or entertainer, you know, small.  So you're going to be a person long in the yoga, be an entertainer.  So you want to be pretty much a decent person. 
[03:05:00]  I don't even know if you can grasp how big of a change it is in people's perception of you over the years  and how you actually pulled it off in these days now being who you are  because there was a perception of you that you couldn't even –  like if you were sitting in this room years ago, we'd be fucking petrified.  Me too.  Me too.  I remember the repercussions.  I was like, God, now what's going to happen?  Fuck, I'm going to go in there for this one.  Shit, I'm going to go in there for this shit. 
[03:05:30]  God damn.  You did what, Mike?  Was it a thought-out kind of a reintroduction of who you are  or was it a natural progression?  No, I wanted to live.  You know, I wasn't going anywhere nice.  I was really dark.  I was really bad.  It goes – you know, listen, this is me, big-time entertainer Mike Tyson,  this big-time guy, undisputed youngest champ of the world.  And I'm down to telling the dope man, 
[03:06:00]  yo, well, you tell your boss to come see me about this.  Oh, shit.  I'm going from that.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  I'm going from that.  No, no, no.  Of course this Mike.  No, no.  My boss wants this Mike.  Well, you tell your boss to come see me about this.  Wow.  It goes from that.  Fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a great part, too.  I love the Mitch Green.  It's fucking great.  It's hilarious.  It's fucking – because I didn't know all the facts.  Now you don't have no idea that a guy like Mitch Green exists.  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  Explain the –  You have no idea.  You see people do this on television, but you don't see people do this.  Well, you don't have nobody in your family.  Well, you know Mitch Green.  You don't fit.  You know Mitch.  You're from the same name.  He represents y'all.  Queen.  Can you explain the Mitch Green thing?  Jimmy, explain the Mitch Green thing.  Well, it's a very famous story.  I mean, they fought – of course, Mike beat him, and then there was a fight in a place  called, what, Dapper Dan's in Harlem, and it was a big story, because Mike really fucked  up Mitch's eye and nose, but he goes through the whole story from your point of view. 
[03:07:00]  Because I don't know – these are some different kind of niggas out here.  I'm thinking Tom Bufin, a tough-ass guy I got walked away, and so all of a sudden,  I'm getting here, all of a sudden, I feel the energy good, and I feel the energy stop  dead, but my back is turned to him.  I turn around, it's Mitch Green.  They scared as a motherfucker.  I'm not scared, because I just kick Mitch's ass.  Why are you scared?  I'm trying to figure out why these guys are scared.  And then Mitch thought that shit again, right?  So I'm like, man, I don't want to hear this shit, Mitch.  You know, I'm around – I'm looking at the successful Jewish guys. 
[03:07:30]  I got Jewish managers and stuff.  And so I'm putting some Jewish – um, langistic skills with my ghetto stuff, right?  My motto, right?  And it's like this.  And I'm like, Mitch, I'm going to fuck this shit.  And Mitch said, and I go like that, and I said, well, Mitch, you really need to – look,  this is my – Mitch, you really need to stop this, because this is not going to be  advantageous to your barometer.  You know, you know, and then – and then I go like that to Mitch, because I already  kicked your ass, Mitch, all right?  So don't start no shit. 
[03:08:00]  I beat your ass, Mitch.  And then once I said that, forget it.  Nigga, you ain't beating me.  Don't even give me my pedigree.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you, bro, man.  I ain't eating, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  Why did I say that?  I shouldn't even say that.  I'm thinking I'm learning some stuff from some white people.  I mean, articulately, people don't respect my skills in Harlem.  I'm thinking people don't respect the AD.  I'm thinking some black people don't respect this.  He lost it.  Holy shit.  What, nigga?  You bitch-ass Sissiland Tyson? 
[03:08:30]  Fuck.  Wow.  I must have fucked him up.  And he wouldn't stay down.  He wouldn't stay down.  I shouldn't have said that.  Once I said you're Mitch, now stop.  I already beat your ass.  I'm not going to be advantageous if I fucking laid you out here, right?  But it was a respectable weapon.  You shouldn't have used a nigga and laid you out.  But anything else was cool.  It could have been handled in Congress.  I could have said it without those words.  Hilarious.  And he said, what?  Classic, man.  Holy shit.  He's a scary guy, Mitch Green, because he fucking seems crazy, man. 
[03:09:00]  No, because he's 6'5", right?  And he had big hair back in the 80s.  They had big hair.  Like, you know, New Jersey people, they had big hair back then.  New Jersey people.  In fact, you know, I'm in a big hair in Jersey in the 80s and stuff.  Billy, piano man.  Joe, Joe.  Yeah, he's the baddest man in the 80s.  You're a big hair girl.  But listen, right?  But he had big hair, so really, he's like 6'12", 7'0", you know.  6'12".  No, he's really big.  Yeah.  Yeah, and he's a fucking guy that just, even though Mike is a beat in me, he wouldn't stop coming. 
[03:09:30]  This guy got a hole in his head, and he's still looking for me.  Wow.  Who is that?  Oh, God, no.  I saw him not long ago, and he came, I said, oh, no.  And he won some money.  I gave him some money.  Take all this shit, all right?  Take this shit, man.  Don't talk to me.  Go.  Go.  I want to see this show.  It's fucking so good, guys.  Why is it ending? 
[03:10:00]  I got other jobs.  Mike's busy.  They should make it into a movie or something, maybe.  You know, God willing.  For HBO.  I'm just very grateful what's happened last year, the year before.  Thank God didn't make things happen this year.  You know, I'm just happy what happened last year and the years before that put me in a position to be here, you know.  It's all about being grateful, you know, because, man, I was almost out of here.  You know, my last case, man, if I got convicted, man, I would have been gone.  Jesus.  I got like 20 felons, man.  I'm the only guy.  I got more felons than anybody that's out on the street. 
[03:10:30]  Ain't nobody on the street with more felons than me that's on the streets.  You know, I'm very grateful.  No, that's just real talk.  Ain't nobody on the streets with more felons than me walking the streets.  I'm very grateful.  Do you have any regrets about not having as many years in boxing during your prime that you could have if you weren't in so much trouble?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  I was getting pretty dark in that moment.  During 91 and stuff, I was getting pretty dark.  And going to prison was probably the best thing that happened to me.  You know, I was out there sleeping with strangers unprotected. 
[03:11:00]  I'm saying, you know, I could have been in the AIDS program.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And I'm not saying that means I'm just very grateful and very lucky in life, you know.  Yeah.  Very lucky.  What was the song?  I wanted to ask you.  There was a song.  There was a great montage scene with black and white footage.  And it looked like it was sped up.  You were punching so fast.  And there was great music playing over it.  Do you know what the song, what the ideas for that was?  Hey, let me explain something to you.  It's not Steve's up.  Oh, no, I know.  Oh, no. 
[03:11:30]  Don't make him demonstrate.  No, I was complimenting you.  I knew it wasn't.  I wasn't implying it was.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm fast you punched.  That was almost my fucking jaw coming.  It's just that I was so extreme back then.  People don't believe that I was moving that fast.  My whole life, that was good, but my whole life was like that.  My head was fast.  I never examined anything.  I made my, you look at it, I was like a cyborg.  You look at it, you make your assumption.  Yeah, yeah.  And your assumption didn't have to be right, but that's the assumption you made.  And you just work on that.  You know.  Was it hard to just live life or were you constantly in fighter mode? 
[03:12:00]  Constantly in fighter mode.  Constantly.  Yeah.  Wow.  So it was hard for relationships or just friendships?  Hard for anything.  Man.  Somebody came in a room over 200 pounds.  He could be a lawyer.  I'm sizing him up.  You're sizing him up?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  What did you say?  Shit.  Instead of saying, excuse me, what did you say?  And how fucking scary would that be?  God damn, Mike.  Holy shit.  That's just how a custom model programmed me.  Right, right.  How many street fights did you have during that time?  A few hundred. 
[03:12:30]  Jesus.  No joke?  My whole life, yeah.  A few hundred when you were...  I love that, yeah.  When I first started fighting and stuff, you fought every day.  Three times a day.  You fight every day.  You ever get your ass kicked back then?  Really?  Who kicked Mike Tyson's ass?  Some girls jumped me and beat the shit out of me.  You know.  Come on.  No, really.  Is that a true story?  Two sisters jumped me and beat the shit.  One of them bit my finger.  Ah, I'm going to fucking fuck you.  A couple of bitches.  The stuff about the ex was fucking awesome. 
[03:13:00]  The way you talked about your ex-wife, you covered that.  But it was like brutally honest and really, really...  That was...  People loved hearing that.  Nobody could really be angry because they stole their stuff.  She did her stuff.  She did a little symposium in all the college.  It's not like she went to some place in Browns or some little WIC center, you know?  She went to university doing a symposium on my ass, right?  And I'm walking down the street and you see these nice, sophisticated white leaders moving  to the side like he's back in segregation.  What the fuck did I do? 
[03:13:30]  You know, I didn't even meet her yet.  Wow.  Where were you sitting in?  I was in the aisle seat probably about 15 or 16 rows back and it was just...  From the second you walked out, it was just...  It was very, very casual.  Obviously, you had put a lot of work into it, but I loved not feeling like I was being  given...  You were hearing a guy talk very honestly and that to me was my favorite part.  It was like...  You didn't stop the language.  The fact that I'm talking about my ex, I'm just talking about what happened in my life.  No doubt about it.  I brought everything on myself, cheating on a probably kick the ass. 
[03:14:00]  So whatever the situation is, you know, everybody knows that it's my fault.  Even though she did real bad things, she was married to a real rotten guy at the time.  You know what I mean?  I was just a kid.  I wanted everything, you know?  Yeah.  So I'm just telling you from my perspective, I'm not saying, well, hey, they're all bad and  I'm all good.  You know, they already said their part about me and I wasn't always...  Yeah, this is your angle on the whole thing.  But this is my angle.  Yeah, sure.  Well, it was very...  That was the funny part was the honest language.  It was nice to hear someone just talk that openly without worrying about...  Like, there was nothing you said where it seemed like you were worried about getting 
[03:14:30]  in trouble.  Like, we do understand.  Men and women, sometimes we break up, but we're still having sex.  We just have sex and then we go on our way.  And still banging.  Yeah.  Shit.  That's hot, dude.  Listen, you're talking about the guy that's the honest guy.  If that never happened in your life, you say, it's over with us, but we're still working  it out sexually.  It's not over sexually.  If that's why you see these girls and these guys, well, I broke up with my boyfriend last  week.  No, it's not over yet.  You come and see me 60 days from now.  You'll be 60 days after the breakup to get over sexually.  All right, that's going to be the last time. 
[03:15:00]  I'm still getting that dick.  After this feeling, I can live without the feeling, then I'll move on.  That's how it is.  Everybody knows.  You stick with your ex, even though you break up, until you find somebody whose sex is better  or just as good.  Wow.  You know, that's just the real deal.  There's a tip for everyone.  Yeah.  That's what means you can do it.  Right, right.  You can't do this.  Let me just stick right here to 2014.  It should be better.  I'm always willing to keep fucking, but they never are.  Like, I'm always trying to fuck a couple more times. 
[03:15:30]  Trying to get a couple more in.  Why is it like that?  How come we still have that connection sexually when you hate their guts and despise them?  Because what makes them dirty isn't what makes them a good person, usually.  It's usually what makes them, their lack of inhibitions, but sure, the lack of inhibitions  makes them a great fuck.  It's the thing that makes them hard to fight with, makes them willing to be dirty in bed,  which is what I kind of need.  So, I'm expecting craziness.  I love the girls looking over, like, really?  Getting an education?  The lovely, lovely ladies on the couch are like, really, Jim?  I'm sorry.  I didn't even know you were here.  I apologize. 
[03:16:00]  No, that's hilarious.  But it's true.  I'm attracted to crazy girls.  I'm not attracted to nice girls.  No, no.  Listen, when I see my fans, you know, and people say, hey, what do you think about these  people coming and dancing now?  I said, listen, everyone, any celebrity, this is what you really have to know.  This is what, you know, under the self-examination.  This is real scary doing this shit.  Fuck Aristotle, right?  Fuck Aristotle, right?  When we see our fans, our fans, believe it or not, even your fans, they're a reflection  of us.  And sometimes we see ourselves, we don't like that shit.  We don't like who we are.  We don't like that these are some crazy motherfuckers. 
[03:16:30]  But we got the breaks.  Cool.  Our circumstances make us put on some breaks.  Not much with Cyrus Radio, but we got some breaks.  Right.  These people are uninhibited.  They go to other lengths.  That's fucking amazing.  That we're capable of going.  That's amazing.  We're capable of going that length, but we're conscious about it, but they're not.  They continue to grow.  They keep going.  Yeah, and that's us.  Keep moving forward.  We think, God, we don't listen to fucking rules and shit, but we do because we know  we got shit to lose, but we don't want to listen to rules and fuck yeah!  Fucking do it!  Yeah! 
[03:17:00]  That's what I really want to do.  That's what I know.  I better not.  My wife is going to kill me.  I want to say, fuck off, dude!  Out your fucking ass!  And don't bother me no more!  Holy shit!  You can't do that.  You can't do that.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  No, sir.  You got to check the show, man.  It's on Sunday, man.  Come on, man.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  No, ma'am.  I'm sure it's sold out.  Let me just get my addiction to the carry for your comprehension and endeavor to exclaminate 
[03:17:30]  more profoundly than if you...  Yes, ma'am.  You know what it's funny, too?  You had some great interactions.  I didn't see Spike there, but you kept blaming certain things on him, which was really funny,  man.  That's the shit he blamed for, you know what I mean?  All my...  You know, I don't want...  Listen, I don't want fucking...  When I'm talking about white people, then you flash me.  Remember, you got the baddest white motherfucker in the country on your ass.  I just let everybody know, this is Spike shit.  You know, we always got that interracial shit going on.  This is Spike.  Yeah.  It was still funny, though, because I think you said something about a...  He asked me, are you scared of white people? 
[03:18:00]  And then a Romney picture flashed behind me, turned around, and went, I'm scared of that  white motherfucker.  It was funny.  I don't want any trouble and stuff.  Oh, shit.  But it was...  It's almost like when you're that honest, nobody...  There's no way for people to criticize you because you're being brutally honest.  What can they do to you if you tell the truth?  And it's really just...  It's like being in a mob.  If you're the mob leader, you can't tell on nobody but yourself.  You're a leader.  Another great thing was you shitting on people in Staten Island who want to act like they're  mobbed up when they're not.  Do you know people in Staten Island?  Yeah, yeah.  A little bit. 
[03:18:30]  It's a weird place.  It's weird, right?  Yeah.  We don't know much about it.  They all got the jackets, the blader, and the fucking sweatsuits.  The young guy has the sweatsuits.  The fucking...  What's that stuff you shoot yourself up with?  Steroids.  Steroids.  Steroids and the chains around their neck with tight chokers.  With their white feet on, just looking around, flexing on the corner all day.  Yeah, they point with their pinky and ring finger.  Hey.  My friend, my friend, I'm sure you're not aware of who I know. 
[03:19:00]  If you know who I know, you wouldn't be so uppity right now.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Oh, I don't want to start.  Yeah.  No, it's good.  It's great, man.  Tyson's hilarious.  Yeah, that's what's so funny about it.  That's right, man.  It was just this great way of fucking just blasting these people.  You know what?  I realized with myself, just like all those guys we talk about, Teddy and all these gangsters,  they're afraid to be vulnerable.  Everybody's afraid to be vulnerable.  Once they're vulnerable, once we see them vulnerable, they can't be who they think they showed they were before. 
[03:19:30]  Once you're vulnerable, you can't be the tough guy no more.  Right.  And that kills them more than anything.  Do you think you're in that boat right now?  Like you've shown your vulnerability, that you're more of a regular guy than we ever thought.  Yeah.  But just like the mob guys and those guys, they're regular guys that can do extraordinary things.  Yeah.  And I never leave that in perspective.  I want to be a regular guy, but the world won't let me be a regular guy, so I have to look at it for what it is.  I can do incredible things for the betterment of humanity. 
[03:20:00]  I think more so now, though.  For myself.  I think you've shown, like, more of yourself these days, recently, over the past few years.  And I think more people are seeing, like, you're a regular guy.  You're a fun guy.  You know, you like having a good time.  And it's not just Mike Tyson that goes and rips people's heads off.  And you have issues with my kids.  But you can still do that.  You know, you want to develop a relationship with your kids.  You know, my oldest daughter was there.  We're estranged a little bit.  We periodically would keep in touch.  And it was just so awesome.  This is the first time she brought a boyfriend.  I never saw her with a guy. 
[03:20:30]  So she had a boyfriend and stuff up there.  Oh, that's got to be fun.  And it's this African guy.  Yeah, so everybody's looking at him and stuff.  You know, we have to all comedians.  We want to go booga, booga, booga.  Booga, booga.  You know, he's an African guy.  He's very studious.  He's very educated.  You know, most Africans are very educated and very studious and stuff and respectable.  But we want to go booga, booga, booga.  But we wouldn't dare.  Tyson rules.  Are they telling us we have to rap?  Oh, that sucks.  But we have to thank, of course, we love Mike Tyson, man. 
[03:21:00]  And I saw this.  And it's easy to plug it because I loved it.  I genuinely loved it.  It sounds amazing.  It's honest and funny and smart.  I never thought about it.  But imagine coming home with Mike Tyson's daughter.  And you're not a big guy.  You're a little 50-pound guy.  Yeah, who's going to want to do that?  And you're an African.  But you know, you're smoothing.  I'm telling you, I'm tickling it.  I'm a ninth grade special aid dropout.  And I'm looking at you.  I want to plug this. 
[03:21:30]  It's called The Undisputed Truth.  It's on Broadway.  Uncontrollable.  Oh, fuck.  It's this Sunday.  It's through this Sunday.  Long Acre Theater.  220 West 48th.  Oh, great.  My life is ruined.  Tight.  I'm trying to build a relationship with my daughter.  This is the shit I do.  This is the first time I meet this guy. 
[03:22:00]  He go...  Fucking Mike Tyson.  No, but listen.  No one is just being an African and a black man.  You know, you're African-American.  You're black.  You know what's going on.  You have to understand this.  But imagine being an African, African-American.  Right.  And you're around a bunch of African-Americans.  And they're looking at you like you're a real species of black.  They don't know if they're going to relate.  You know any boorish in South Africa?  You don't know what the hell to say.  I hope they got bigger right here. 
[03:22:30]  I told you.  You don't know, you know?  That's awesome.  And they look jacked up, but they're so smart and intelligent and educated and high IQs.  But they look like they're famished, right?  This guy can run up Corporation 500.  God damn.  You can't make this up, man.  Oh, hell no.  You're envious because this guy looks like he's smart as a motherfucker, right?  I got all this money.  I'm a ninth grade special ed dropout.  Fuck, you don't like him.  You're envious now?  The kids don't like you?  You educated the kids? 
[03:23:00]  They don't like you because you're illiterate and shit?  I don't think you're illiterate.  I'm going to say, Mike Tyson, best guest we've ever had.  Absolutely.  Best guest we've ever had.  Listen, I sent my kids to all these schools, right?  And I text them, and I misspelled them.  And they come back, right?  Dad, that's not how you spell my name.  That's not how you spell this stuff.  Dad, you don't spell it that way, Dad.  Why can't they say no?  What the word it meant?  Why can't they say yeah, Dad?  They say you don't spell it that way, Dad.  That's my only insecure they can rip on me, right?  Because normally I say, I'm going to send you to school to learn, girl. 
[03:23:30]  I'm going to go to school because I sent you.  I had to work to send your ass to school to get these Ivy League educations.  That's why.  You sacrifice.  I sacrifice.  God damn, Dad.  It's Gina, Dad.  You know what I'm talking about, Gina, Dad?  God damn, Dad.  It's an E, it's an I, not an E, Dad.  We're trying to get them out.  Mike has to go.  We are trying to get them out.  Sorry, guys.  No, no, no.  We don't want you out, please.  I'm liable to get locked up.  I'll use a couple of endorsements.  I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.  God damn.  Can we get a quick picture?  Mike, thanks so much, man.  This is part of being mad. 
[03:24:00]  You feel you can get away with it, but you can't.  People want to hear this shit, right?  Of course, eventually.  You want to get away with it because it's legal.  Yeah.  And this is why you can't call me because that was Cyrus.  You were allowed to do that, but then they do this, Opie and Andy, but you're a responsible  adult, and you know no matter where you're at, if you're in hell, you don't curse.  Oh, yeah.  Well, here you do.  Yeah, we turn.  This is worse than hell sometimes.  And listen, the show I want to be on is Wowsby, Wowsby.  What's that show again?  What is it?  Wowsby.  Wowsby.  The Wowsby show. 
[03:24:30]  Wowsby.  Oh, I know it.  Fresh beat band.  Fresh beat band.  I want to be on the Fresh beat band.  Wow, wow, Wowsby.  Yeah, I want to be on a Fresh beat band.  I got a kid.  My kid loves that stuff, but I have to be on these shows.  I'm never going to be on that show, right?  I'm never going to be with the Wild Beach band and make up my new dance.  The Stroke.  You can't make that with the kids.  The Stroke, man.  I'm coming, Elizabeth.  I'm coming against you, Elizabeth.  The name Stroke doesn't even sound like it's a good dance, right?  They're making something perverted. 
[03:25:00]  The Stroke, I'm coming against you, kid.  I'm coming.  Mike Tyson.  You said fuck, Mike Tyson.  Fuck, Mike.  Yo, look at this shit.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Sirius XM. </pre>
