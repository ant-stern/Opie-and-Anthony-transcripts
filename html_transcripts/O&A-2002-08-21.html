<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts' return from vacation, immediately diving into Anthony Cumia's recently finalized divorce.  The broadcast was rife with sexually explicit language, vulgar jokes, and numerous listener calls.  A significant portion focused on media coverage of the divorce, specifically articles detailing alleged sexual acts, including a "frisky m√©nage a trois."  The hosts repeatedly used the phrase "two girls for every boy" as a recurring joke.  They read and commented extensively on these articles, often exaggerating and fabricating details for comedic effect.  Anthony's ex-wife's lawyer, Dominic Barbara, was frequently referred to as "Fat Dominic" and characterized as a "publicity hound."

A substantial part of the show featured a bizarre and rambling phone call with a listener named Lynn, who claimed to be Anthony's daughter and Opie's girlfriend's daughter, stating she might be pregnant with Opie's son, Joey's, child.  Lynn's conversation was filled with sexually suggestive comments, requests for money, and demands for gumballs, punctuated by accusations of incest and discussions of abortion.  Her mental state was repeatedly questioned by the hosts.  Lynn also requested help relocating her dog, with the conversation descending into discussions about the possibility of euthanasia, further escalating the absurdity and inappropriate nature of the exchange.  Opie's appearance on a kiss cam at a sporting event was also mentioned.

The show then featured a call with comedian Colin Quinn, promoting his television show.  The conversation touched upon Quinn's show, Jimmy Norton's appearances on it, and Anthony Cumia's divorce, with repeated allusions to a scandalous three-way involving Anthony.  Jimmy Norton subsequently called in, discussing his appearances on Quinn's show,  making jokes about celebrities and diseases, and speculation around his continued presence on Opie and Anthony.

The show included the "FU Line," where callers left angry messages about various annoyances.  The focus returned to Anthony Cumia's divorce, with the hosts reading and commenting on a New York Post article, "Radio Raunch Man in R-Rated Divorce."  Callers such as "Lady Di," "Uncle John," and "Gooch" contributed to the discussion.  The hosts played and analyzed audio from an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 featuring their friend Rick as an extra, with highly vulgar commentary on Rick's perceived "gay-like" posture.  A news story about a submarine sinking a Japanese trawler prompted a rambling, offensive discussion with callers sharing military anecdotes. The show concluded with a highly offensive, profane skit about Bill Clinton's visit to Vietnam.  Anthony Cumia himself participated in the broadcast, reacting to the articles and calls concerning his divorce.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  No one has ever done anything like this.  I know you're out there.  I can feel you now.  I know that you're afraid.  You're afraid of us.  You're afraid of change.  I'm not what you think.  I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see.  A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries.  A world where anything is possible. 
[00:00:30]  There is.  There's these people being in there in the future alone.  My signal.  Unleash hell.  Welcome to the bottomless pit of the big nine.  Here's a clip.  Jesus Christ, this is going to stop.  Is that mango or papaya?  That'll get our ratings up.  That's how we supposed to win in the ratings.  If we can't talk about food and our pleasure.  Suck it up.  Walk it off, big.  I love camel toe.  They're shaving for America.  No ass. 
[00:01:00]  I got to see that ass.  No!  No!  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  No ass.  I hope he says it isn't bad.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Thank God we get back today.  Oh, okay, okay, terrific. 
[00:01:30]  Insert joke here.  Your handy's great in a pinch.  Did I just hear that?  Hello?  Hello?  Pull your pants down.  Ew!  You got bad eyes.  We don't get that for me, Shiloh.  Number three.  You're all burning in hell, damn you.  Alcohol equals great radio.  Are you not entertained?  Making the First Amendment seem like a bad idea. 
[00:02:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Too good for every boy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.  Too good for every boy. 
[00:02:30]  Too good for every boy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, everybody, we're all going to get laid.  Two of the greatest beats of ass I've ever had, and I've had them all over the world.  Wow, I get a drink.  My bad.  Too good for every boy. 
[00:03:00]  My bad, my bad, my bad.  We've got Bush.  We've got Bush.  Look where he's going now.  Look what he's doing now.  They're all pink on the inside.  You're a filthy whore.  I was taking the boobies.  Look what he's doing now. 
[00:03:30]  If I said you had a beautiful body, would you take your pants off and dance around a little?  Suck it!  Two girls for every boy.  Oh, jeez, I don't want to get the age, fellas.  Virgin.  Hey, man. 
[00:04:00]  Hey, beautiful.  Confess!  Confess!  Confess!  Was that supposed to be sexy?  Very funny.  Very funny.  What?  And don't be stupid.  Exactly.  Two girls for every boy.  That is very funny.  What?  Why would that song be making some kind of a comeback? 
[00:04:30]  What?  On this program.  What?  Take your bra off and take it off now.  Don't shoot the head.  Don't shoot the head.  Shut up.  Can I touch it? 
[00:05:00]  It looks like a wreck.  It's in the hole.  Sweet, merciful crap.  Hey, who's the sufferer?  I thought I told you to shut up.  All right.  Where's that song coming from?  What the hell is that?  Hey, we got a big team today.  I bet.  What you're smart asses.  What you're goddamn smart asses. 
[00:05:30]  Ah, that's good.  All right.  How was your vacation?  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  How was your vacation?  What?  Two girls for the free board.  Should I sheepishly deny it or a couple sheepishly?  A couple phone numbers.  Yeah, we're back from vacation and it seems like a lot of things happened while we were away. 
[00:06:00]  What a great vacation.  Wasn't it good?  Shut up.  What a toy.  What a toy.  What a toy.  Yeah.  Well, we really don't even have to give out the phone numbers today for some reason, Anthony.  Why is that?  They just seem to be lighting up.  I think they've been waiting a week to talk to us.  Yes.  In New York, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly.  Philly. 
[00:06:30]  Philly.  I got to tell you.  I'm here and we're doing really, really well in Philly.  I'm hearing things.  We're hearing things about ratings and things.  A little bit.  No, you made fun.  You made fun.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  So if you're in Philly or anywhere else outside of New York, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW.  Uh, oh, they switched our phones around since we've been.  Ah.  That's okay.  We'll go over here.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  What an appropriate song to start the show off with.  I don't understand what you're even talking about. 
[00:07:00]  It's a big deal for everyone.  Anthony.  What?  You're worth $100 million?  Yes.  Wow.  So I've been told.  You guys made it a lot.  All right, you guys suck.  See you later.  So I've been told.  The lies.  Oh, my God.  We'll get to the whole damn thing.  Did you realize that you were worth $100 million, Anthony?  Opie, I still don't.  You're still wearing the same crappy sweater that when I found you seven years ago. 
[00:07:30]  I got the same sweater.  I have my swatch watch.  I think even Opie wears a tag just because somebody gave it to him.  Oh, that's because Joey Paisano gave his tag.  I still have my swatch.  Look at my sneakers.  Look at my sneakers.  I've had these for about two years.  Look at the bottom of your sneakers.  I know.  All you see is white because the tread has worn away.  $100 million.  $100 million.  You can buy shoes every day.  $1 million. 
[00:08:00]  And you know something?  That only means that you, too, are worth $100 million.  You are listening to $200 million worth of entertainment.  What a bunch of crap.  A bargain at any price.  $100 million?  $100 million.  Why the hell am I still renting the top floor of a house?  Right.  What is wrong with me?  Yeah.  Why am I renting an apartment in Brooklyn?  I'm renting an apartment in Brooklyn. 
[00:08:30]  I think I got to go shop for a mansion or something.  A compound.  How about just a house in general?  You know what I saw?  I saw something in the paper.  Dude, I rent the top half of a house and I still can't get a hot shower.  Right.  And I'm worth $100 million?  $100 million.  What am I doing?  I got pigeons that roost outside of my porch that I can't go out there.  There's wild animals out on the little patio.  But $100 million.  I saw in the paper somebody was selling their house.  And it was a house in Hollywood Hills. 
[00:09:00]  And it was 1.4 mil.  Something like that.  Beautiful thing.  And I'm like, how many of these can I buy?  You know, I could buy a whole neighborhood in the Hollywood Hills.  And let me tell you something.  I was reading the articles over a break when I was up in Killington skiing.  Yeah.  And I'm saying, I'm worth $100 mil.  $100 mil.  First thought in my head, I could buy pretty much any PlayStation 2 game I want.  Pretty much.  Maybe even two.  $100 mil, sea sucker. 
[00:09:30]  Pete, what's up?  Listen, Anthony.  Yeah.  You are my hero.  There we go.  Let me tell you something.  I've been trying to get my wife to do what you got your wife to do.  I've been trying for 10 years now.  Then you dump her.  If you have $100 million to spend.  I guess so.  But you are a poor ass.  Don't motherf***er.  Watch your language.  Wait, wait, wait.  Stop.  You got to watch the language. 
[00:10:00]  I'm sorry.  Listen, I'm sorry.  You're my hero.  I just had a call and tell you that, man.  I don't know how you did it, but I wish I could do it.  All right, Pete.  I will say, of course.  You know what's funny about this?  No one outside New York has a clue what we're talking about yet.  No.  No.  We'll get to it in a few minutes here.  It was in the...  But just to address something quickly, that gentleman was talking about, Opie.  Yeah.  These allegations of certain things that happened...  Yeah.  ...were, um... 
[00:10:30]  Actually, yes, when I was a tin knocker, so it doesn't...  It doesn't matter.  What?  It was when I was a tin knocker.  What happened with it?  These allegations, some of which ended up in two newspapers.  Yeah.  You know what I'm talking about.  No, I...  I'm just saying that they were, you know...  Things were going on before.  So this wasn't the first time things went on?  Oh, shut up.  You know that.  Well, I got to play reporter here.  Not talking to anyone else, but you'll talk to your pal. 
[00:11:00]  Well.  Well, let's go across.  I'm not going to get into any details.  Aaron, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Welcome back.  All right.  Remember when you were in school and you'd play, you know, What Did I Do on My Summer Vacation?  Yeah.  Well, I'm just wondering, maybe we can play a little game with what Anthony did on his  little week off vacation.  Well, um...  I was in court.  Really?  Really, you smartass.  Yes.  Know how surreal it was?  I was up in Killington, you know, doing some skiing and stuff. 
[00:11:30]  And in the morning, I'd go down the access road there to get my papers.  And I'm reading the papers, drinking some coffee.  There's a blizzard going on in Vermont.  So I feel like I'm in another country.  And all of a sudden, I'm going through the Daily News, excuse me, in the Post, and I  see Anthony's picture, and I'm like, wait a minute, I know that guy.  I know that guy.  Yeah, but I wasn't thinking, you know what I mean?  And all of a sudden, I'm like, oh, my God!  Hey, I got one more little observation.  You know that the mafia guy, the chin, he walks around a little early in his bathrobe 
[00:12:00]  and makes people think he's crazy?  Maybe that's what Anthony's doing with all the old clothes, you know?  He doesn't want anyone letting him in on the $100 million.  He still dresses better.  All right, Aaron.  Later, guys.  A couple more phone calls, and then we'll read them.  No, I think we should read the articles.  Yeah.  I think they came out a week ago tomorrow.  It was, Leo's last Tuesday.  Last Tuesday.  We'll end these articles.  I will read them word for word.  Oh, you will?  You have your little bell over there, and when you want to comment, you just bing, bing,  bing, and you can pipe in, okay? 
[00:12:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I think that's the way to do this, right?  Mm-hmm.  Sure.  And if they dump out down the hall, I swear to God, I'm getting off my chair, and I will  punch you in your face, Craig.  I'm looking at what's dump worthy.  There's a couple things they will dump out on.  Yeah?  Yes.  Rick, go warn him now.  Where?  I will walk down the hall and punch him in the head if he dumps out of anything in this  article today.  Oh, mentions of other programming?  Yeah.  Okay.  And warn Jeremy, too.  Yeah, this is, you know, let's not be ridiculous about what we can and can't say. 
[00:13:00]  Bobby, what's going on?  Dude, what's going on?  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Look, I got to tell you.  What did I lick the other guy?  So what did I learn on my summer vacation?  Yeah.  Oh, you learned how to ski.  Yeah.  You learned how to give away half your money.  And I got to tell you, a poor little schmuck from Huntington, you knocked in and you knocked  somebody else apparently because of the caution.  Shut up.  You are my hero.  And now you're living in Bay Ridge.  I love you.  Shut up. 
[00:13:30]  I love you.  I got some cool things I need to show you.  Come on out for a beer.  All right.  I need some money, too.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Tom.  This is all people commenting.  We haven't even read the article.  I know.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Hey, Ed.  Yeah.  Congratulations on the most expensive threesome in the history of time.  Bunch of asses.  And guys.  Guys.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, getting Norton on us.  Where's Norton?  Is this true?  I got audio of Anthony leaving the courthouse last Monday afternoon.  You do?  Yeah.  Freedom.  Yeah.  There's a whole orchestra there.  Yeah.  I heard you set up an orchestra right on the sidewalk.  Yeah.  In between the paparazzi that was...  The paparazzi.  And had paparazzi following him. 
[00:14:30]  Just goes to show you how paparazzi oblivious I am.  Because right when we were walking out of the courtroom, we'll get into all of this when we get back.  But I'm walking out of the courtroom with the ex.  And we're walking down those huge steps.  And if you've never seen the courthouse in New York City, it's the same one at the end of The Godfather where...  Is it really the same one?  Yeah.  Where the guy, one of Corleone's guys, dressed like a cop, shoots the guy in the back and he falls down those steps. 
[00:15:00]  It's those steps.  I didn't know that scene was...  Oh, that's those steps.  I didn't know that.  He had less pain in what happened to him and The Godfather rolling down those steps than I had walking down them.  Sean, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  Welcome back.  I was just going to tell Anthony, if he's worth $100 million, I think the next three-way he's going to have is going to be with the Olsen twins.  A-hoo-ha!  A-hoo-ha!  A-hoo-ha!  A-hoo-ha!  Too much.  So, yeah, the cameras are going off, you know?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:15:30]  And the ex goes, uh-oh.  So I'm like, huh?  And I see the cameras going.  I turn around to see who's behind me that they're taking pictures of.  I swear to God.  I'm like, who's here?  Must be a big case.  Must be a big important case.  You know what?  Click, click, click.  You and I really are clueless as far as what's going on with this radio show.  I completely agree with you.  We just think we're doing a radio show for a couple of our pals.  We got no clue.  A few of my friends from the Harborfields days. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  That's what I'm thinking.  And a few people from my family listen.  A little bit here and there.  There are guys out front snapping pictures like madmen.  And then we're walking down the sidewalk.  They're following.  And they're snapping pictures.  And then they get in, like, this one guy with a cane is walking by and he gets in the frame.  Right.  So the guy with the cane goes, don't take pictures of me!  And hits the guy upside the head with his cane.  But these photographers are so, like, used to now suing that they get away with anything.  And they got balls.  The guy's like, you mother effer. 
[00:16:30]  Hit me again, son of a bitch.  He's cursing at them.  And I'm just, like, smiling.  I don't care.  You know?  Walking.  To the point where the photographers, when they finally got done at the end of the block,  went, all right, thanks, man.  I'm like, yeah, okay.  Could have pulled the Sean Penn, you know, and grabbed the camera.  That's fine.  I didn't want to end up back in the court building giving away any more money.  We'll tell you guys this much.  Anthony is a free man after how many years?  I don't even know how many years it's been.  This went on for two and a half.  Two and a half years.  Two and a half years. 
[00:17:00]  You are finally divorced, my friend.  Two and a half years.  Are we supposed to throw you a party or something?  We could have one.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do.  Yeah, we could have some kind of little party.  Am I, like, the best man for your divorce party?  Am I supposed to do something here?  Yeah, you could.  I don't know.  We've got to get him on for it.  Yeah.  No, I think that's done.  Thank you.  You know something?  I crack the papers open and I start reading.  And I'm like, you know, all right, there are some things in here that are a little racy. 
[00:17:30]  But then I'm thinking, oh, my.  I'm thinking more saucy.  Saucy.  Little scandal.  There's some scandal and some sauce.  Another Long Island-based sex scandal.  A little saucy.  Like Joey Butterfuco.  Yeah, I came out with my Joey Butterfuco pants to comment to the press.  But I'm thinking, like, you know something?  We do this show.  It's not like we do a right-wing political program.  So, you know, I think it's almost expected of us clowns and the people that listen to this show. 
[00:18:00]  But then I'm reading going, oh, my God.  Could you imagine having to read something like young boys or, you know, men going in there?  And, like, how do you come back to your show after it's like, yes, there were three men in the bed?  Like, how do you come back from that?  You just leave the planet.  Instead.  Two girls for every boy. 
[00:18:30]  Tony, what's going on?  You can handle those comments.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, man.  Man, don't sweat it.  To quote Rodney from back to school, do you feel like you just got paroled?  Yeah.  A hundred million, my ass.  A hundred mil.  Yeah.  And punch that fat bastard attorney on.  It's right in his fat gizzard neck.  A gizzard neck.  You rule, brother.  All right, Tony.  Shut up.  Let's go to Louis.  Louis.  Louis.  Hey, dude.  Yeah.  Anthony's name is now, hi, I'm Elmer J. Kumia. 
[00:19:00]  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Again.  I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  Millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Again.  Hi, I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  I'm a millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Again.  I love that one.  Hey, dude.  Do you want to do something to Anthony, O.P.?  O.P.?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to do something to Anthony?  Give him back some of his money, you cheap bastard.  Well, we're worth a hundred million each.  A hundred mil.  A hundred million.  Boy, a hundred million and living in a tree house. 
[00:19:30]  Who'd have thought it?  Which means my mansion will be twice as big as Anthony.  Right.  Hi, I'm Elmer J. Kumia.  I'm a millionaire.  I own a mansion and a yacht.  Louis, you're funny.  You're funny.  Don't...  Bye-bye, dude.  Look at Matt from Philly.  Everyone from the other city going, what happened?  We'll tell you.  We're going to read the articles in a couple minutes here.  Chris, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Anthony, I need some advice.  All right.  How do I get my wife to bring a second girl into the bedroom?  Oh, and listen, guys, I got a question. 
[00:20:00]  Jackass.  Is there going to be a line of HVAC vans going to the divorce party?  Two girls for every boy.  Later, guys.  All right.  Allegations.  No one wants to talk to me today.  Richie, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to congratulate Anthony on his divorce.  Okay.  Thank you.  And I'm also wondering, is he going to be on that program The Bachelor tonight?  See, we figured we'd give the listeners the first shot before we read the articles, 
[00:20:30]  because I knew they'd have some good stuff tonight.  Hey, Ant, you would think with a hundred million bucks, you could have picked a better sweater  to wear to court.  Sweater?  How long until Old Dirty shows up for a loan?  Let me explain something about what you were wearing in the shots that the paparazzi took.  Yes.  It was your NBC jacket that we got for free when we were doing the XFL thing, because we  showed up at Giant Stadium to tape a piece for the XFL thing day, and McMahon there, Shane 
[00:21:00]  O'Mac, saw us and goes, dude, you guys can't tape TV looking like that, so he ran and got  us those jackets.  Yes.  You've been wearing it ever since.  Well, yeah, yeah.  It's nice, comfy, warm, and when I finally noticed they were taking pictures of me, it  went through my head.  And, you know, I don't want the people that own this company, which is CBS, to see me wearing  an NBC jacket.  So I kind of flipped the thing around a little bit, and it showed my cheap sweater.  You can still tell that it was the NBC jacket. 
[00:21:30]  I know.  What are you going to do?  Like I said, I don't have a clue.  I'm a loser.  What can I say?  George, what's going on?  Oh, hey.  Welcome back, guys.  All right.  Thanks, man.  Anthony, I got one question.  Yeah.  Are you going to resurrect, too, for Tuesday?  And Wednesday?  And Thursday?  You're very funny.  All right.  Shut up.  Dr. Martin Luther King checking in.  Yes.  Free at last.  Free at last.  Thank God Almighty, I'm free at last. 
[00:22:00]  Thank you, doctor.  Oh, my pleasure.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Since you're, like, so rich and famous, can I borrow $200 until I get my check?  No problem.  Come on by.  Cool.  All right, bro.  That's funny.  Peter?  Yes.  Can we celebrate with a box of wine?  Listen, I got another idea for you.  How about some cleaning stuff to get the stink of her out of your system?  I'm the cleaning guy.  What's the cleaning stuff?  Just imagine how big a box of wine you can buy. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, my God.  One the size of the refrigerator.  I'd have to take all the shelves out and just shove the box of wine in.  Yeah.  Jeez, man.  All right.  Well, why don't we take a break?  Yeah, we'll read the articles.  We got two to read.  And then Ant will comment in a very, very interesting week.  All right.  We'll continue next, right, Ant?  Right.  Two girls for every more. 
[00:23:00]  We've left out the entire country except for New York.  Yeah, I know.  We'll explain what happened with Anthony to the rest of the country in a couple of minutes  with these little newspaper articles, okay?  Rip them out Wednesday.  Oh, man.  One bad score.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I love that. 
[00:23:30]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, including Philly!  We're hearing things about Philly once again.  Good things.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You know, well, you make fun.  A little bit.  A little bit.  We're a little more gooder than we were last month is what I'm hearing.  Yeah.  Don't have details because the company doesn't subscribe to ratings anymore. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, for some reason.  I hope that's remedied soon.  Thank God they don't subscribe to ratings anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if you're in Philly or somewhere else outside of New York, here's the number for you.  866-277-4WOW.  Finally, we can read the articles and get into Anthony's divorce.  Yes.  After two and a half years, Anthony is a free man.  Two and a half years in the making.  But, um, so, uh, hold on just two seconds.  I don't want to kill everybody on this, but I got to find out what is going on here online, too. 
[00:24:30]  Come on.  Come on.  There's plenty of time for me in the barrel.  Believe me.  But when I see, when I look up and see Carl says, saw Opie and Sandy on kiss cam at the  Islander game.  What?  What?  What is that?  What is it?  Anthony, while we're on vacation.  Wait, wait.  No, no, no, no, no.  What?  Ah, nah, nah, nah.  What?  I want to talk to Carl about you on the kiss cam. 
[00:25:00]  Come on.  Where is, uh, Carl?  Hey, Carl.  What's up, man?  I was at the Islander game this weekend, and, uh, I saw some guy in a suede jacket with  long blonde hair.  Yeah.  He was on the kiss cam, and he was, uh, he was kissing Rick's sister.  I think it was Opie.  He said that's behind the net, right?  Right at the glitz? 
[00:25:30]  I think it was you.  I don't know.  I know you guys have been, uh, you've been wrecking on air for me there with the divorce,  but that was pretty gay.  That's cute.  Yeah.  Did you tell him to, like, do you tell him to watch you on camera, or they just got you?  I think that was, uh, I think that was one of my brothers.  We all look alike.  Yeah.  What is the, uh, kiss cam, though?  What is it?  What?  What is the kiss cam?  What?  Rick, do you know what this is?  Because Opie's not going to tell me.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  What does it look like? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, Rick, your mic's not on.  Usually I know when to turn your mic on.  Oh.  What does it look like?  Hold on, hold on.  You know the big boards that have in stadiums and all that stuff?  Uh-huh.  Look, you're something wrong.  Oh, well, ain't no particular time at all.  Oh, I'm tired of doing it.  I just want your extra time and your kiss.  Pucker up and kiss my ass.  I'm who's a fucker.  I'm who's a fucker. 
[00:26:30]  Stop.  It's not about me.  I just want to know what the kiss cam is.  What does it look like?  It's got to be on the big jumbotron, the big screen that they have at the stadium.  And they have cameras panning the audience constantly.  All right.  I can totally picture it.  Anyone who's been to a game has seen this.  Like you see the Budweiser fan of the game.  Right.  And they put this wacky looking person.  Uh-huh.  Look at him.  Hey, there's a big fan.  He's got the hat on and his shirt's off and he's woo.  But he can't seem to find the camera until the last minute right when they cut away. 
[00:27:00]  Well, this one is filled with a heart.  Oh, is it a cheap, like a bad wedding videographic?  That or like a Valentine's car.  A big Valentine's car.  Or like a big pumpkin or something with a cutout.  A pumpkin, I get it.  A pumpkin joke.  All right.  I'll bring a little picture.  Do I make you horny?  What?  So it's the heart.  Right.  And they put couples in there. 
[00:27:30]  A happy and love couple.  So couples that are at the game go in the heart.  They put you on video and you're in the heart on the big screen.  And they freeze it there for the entire crowd to see.  Oh, they freeze.  It's a big heart on the Jumbotron.  And then the cameraman, they pick out couples, Anthony.  Right.  Too bad you can't do the kiss cam.  Can't get three on the Jumbotron.  Oh, shut up, you dick.  Hey, at least he didn't bring Gary with him that game.  This one's just for couples. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah, imagine if you brought Gary to that game.  I hope he had a young boy.  And then they go from like couple to couple and then they put you on the spot and you can  either be a deke or you can like, you know, do a little peck thing.  And sometimes they get really funny and they put two guys on the Jumbotron.  Oh, and then what are you going to do?  And the whole audience wonders if those two are going to kiss.  Oh, sometimes, you know, they think they got a couple, but it turns out to be a brother  and sister.  Oh, again, they're not going to kiss. 
[00:28:30]  They're not going to kiss.  Not in public, anyway.  Oh, so you're there on the kiss cam at the owner game on, I don't know, when was the  wild game?  Saturday, I guess?  Is it a tie-in with one of the kiss radio stations?  No, no, no.  No?  Okay.  So maybe that would have been an ironic little twist of the whole thing.  Look, Hopi's on a different station's little promotional device.  No, no.  No, no.  Then they could have like, you know, every city has a jamming station. 
[00:29:00]  You got to jam your schlong home on the camera.  Dan, can I read the articles, please?  Well, I guess we're to that portion of the program.  Hey, were you kissing?  They got you on the kiss cam?  Like, did they freeze it in mid-kiss?  I don't know what happened.  You know what happened.  No, I really don't.  Stop it.  I didn't look up at the jumbotron.  You didn't look at your faces on the kiss cam?  No, I didn't want to look at my face.  So you weren't sure?  Did they freeze it during like a...  This ass...  Like a little pucker?  This ass...  This ass-wipe cameraman. 
[00:29:30]  Ass-wipe.  We sit down low, and every game, he's trying to get me on the stupid kiss cam.  Kiss cam.  And every time, I'm like, no, I don't want to be on the kiss cam.  Right.  This time around, he, you know, he surprised me.  Got you on the kiss cam.  Look at this.  Frank went out.  So what if Opian standing around the kiss cam at the Coliseum?  Ant was on the taking it up the A on divorce court cam on Monday.  You jackass. 
[00:30:00]  They freeze-framed me crying.  Hey, Ope, what's next?  Wedding proposal during Squirrel?  Squirrel!  Joe, one leg, from Jersey.  You have been tall.  Sure.  Very nice, yeah.  Why is it about me?  It's not.  It's not about me today, Anthony.  You're avoiding the inevitable here.  Trying.  I know.  We're trying to get to 520.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[00:30:30]  I was just wondering if these articles fall into the bitches that'll get you category.  Could be a bitches that'll get you.  Sucks to be you.  Unlucky lottery.  All right, Jeff.  Thank you.  Are you ready, Ian?  A little play on words are really funny.  Jock shocks in court.  I see that headline.  Play on the whole shock jock thing, Ope.  Look, they turned it around.  Jock shocks in court.  Instead of shock jock.  What shocking that's going on?  Shocking. 
[00:31:00]  It's a bitches that'll get you.  And the other headlines, radio raunch man in R-rated divorce.  Radio raunch man.  It's a bitches.  It's the raunch man show.  What a doodle.  I'm the raunch man.  It's a bitches that'll get you.  What a doodle.  You're listening to more of the raunch man show.  Bone dry, smuggling bones.  Maureen, what's going on? 
[00:31:30]  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Anthony, did you take your girlfriend down to the village this Saturday to celebrate your  ending nuptials?  Yes, we did go and we took a play.  I thought that was you because I saw you scrubbing an extremely young girl's ass like Mr. Miyagi  doing the wax on.  How many seats did Anthony take up at the Janis Joplin show?  Just two.  Oh, I threw him up at the bar. 
[00:32:00]  He was up at the bar.  But he had a very nice sweater on, though.  Thank you.  One of my nice sweaters.  I went to see...  Thank you, Maureen.  I went to see Love Janis.  Yeah.  I said Janis Joplin is based on the letters she wrote back to our family.  Very good.  And I'm terrible at names, so I'm not going to remember one of them.  But the woman that sings in it, sings some of Janis' old songs, really good.  Was it your mom?  No, it wasn't my mom singing Janis Joplin. 
[00:32:30]  I was actually...  I'm actually going to send my mother to the show so she can see how it's supposed to be done.  Really good.  It's down on Bleeker.  Down on Bleeker Street here in lovely Manhattan.  So if you get a chance...  Love Janis.  Very good show.  All right.  The double seat...  No.  What?  I only had two seats.  Me and Mike.  I wasn't asking.  She's a very young girl.  Ruffing her ass.  Like Mr. Miyagi.  Like Mr. Miyagi.  See? 
[00:33:00]  Unbelievable.  All right.  People are jackasses.  I am so entrenched in the barrel today.  I am so deep in the barrel.  You really thought that kiss on a jumbotron thing was going to get you out of it?  I was hoping for a bit of a distraction.  Look, I'll admit it.  It was very faggy and I...  What are you going to do, though?  I know.  What are you going to do?  Eh, you got to, you know, be on the kiss cam.  I was on the kiss cam.  There you go.  At least I wasn't getting hit in the head by a hockey puck. 
[00:33:30]  Ah.  Could be fatal.  Talk about unlucky lottery, huh?  Yeah.  All right, man.  We better take a break and get into this next.  Hey, man.  You interrupted.  Hold on.  If you listen closely, you can hear people screaming.  Dude, you...  You can actually hear the listeners screaming at you.  They're all yelling, quit stalling.  Not at me.  What?  Dude.  Play back the tape.  Look, how did this break start?  Let's get into the divorce.  You had to go to Carl.  I don't remember.  The Carl thing was no big deal.  Hmm. 
[00:34:00]  Hmm.  Now they're all mad at you.  Look.  What?  Paul, what's up?  Would you two whores please tell the damn story?  I've been sitting here for an hour and a half waiting.  Yeah, what?  You know what, you guys?  You should be fired.  Fired.  See you.  All right, bye.  No.  You know what?  We could give them a little something as we go to break, though.  Yeah?  Yeah, because we need some time here.  Oh, okay.  Two girls for every, two girls for every whore. 
[00:34:30]  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  Can we get into the saucy material next?  It's a little saucy, a little racy.  Should we have a disclaimer for the parents that are out there listening with young children?  Perhaps some.  If you don't want to hear about aunt's divorce, you're going to want to turn off the radio right now.  Please.  Yes, yes.  We're going to read the articles next, Anthony.  No more tangents, okay?  We've got to promise.  We've got to promise our audience. 
[00:35:00]  I know.  No more tangents.  Let them hang like the animals they are.  We're going to love you.  We're going to leave the train. 
[00:35:30]  We're going to leave the train.  We're going to leave the trains.  Phone numbers for New York, 877-692-1027. 
[00:36:00]  For everyone else listening to us, you want to get a hold of the show, 866-277-4.  Wow.  Anthony, I was going through my mail last week.  Yes.  And I got a letter from one of our listeners.  I got a letter from one of our listeners in the Massachusetts area, Anthony.  Yes.  And I felt pretty special because she's completely out of her effing mind.  Uh-huh.  But just when you were feeling special, I guess.  I know.  I was bragging about the letter and I was showing you today. 
[00:36:30]  And you got one today from the same lady.  I certainly did.  She writes us separately.  And I feel extra, extra special, Opie, because look what I got with mine.  You got a picture.  I got a photo.  This, Jimmy, you want to take a look?  Oh, wow.  Is that before or after she kidnapped James Collins?  Exactly.  That's what we were thinking.  She's a middle-aged woman that looks a lot like, what's her name here?  Just read the letter, Mr. Man.  There's a railroad tie and some sledgehammers in her future.  What date is your letter? 
[00:37:00]  Mine is dated 5-6-0-2.  And you're just getting yours.  Mine was 5-6-0-2 as well.  When did you get yours?  Last week.  Last week?  Well, that's the fine mail delivery system we have here.  Thank God the security is in place where they check all the letters that come in.  They rip them open.  Then they put a seal on it that says it's been checked.  Here it is, Anthony.  Yes.  Dated 5-6-0-2.  From the lovely Lynn from Massachusetts.  Okay?  Lynn from Massachusetts.  Well, the letter starts off, hi, Daddy. 
[00:37:30]  Now, that might, in some cases, be kind of cool.  If the girl is maybe a fan, maybe she's got a little something for you.  She's going, oh, hi, Daddy.  You know.  Hi, Daddy.  A little sick, but could be taken in that context.  Forgive me, please, for not writing for many months.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment.  Not my son, Joey.  Daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me in my apartment. 
[00:38:00]  I'm assuming, yes, it is your son, Joey.  Is that who she's talking about?  Yes.  I've never met my son, Joey.  Dad, I love Anthony's son, Joey, so much.  Mom mailed me $178 for doing good work at her house.  Dad, I am having my dog, Rock, move in with me.  You have no say in it, Daddy.  Mom told me you wanted my phone number.  I don't know if I want you to have my phone number, period.  Daddy, I have something to say. 
[00:38:30]  Here goes.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  What?  Let me read that again.  Yeah.  That's exactly what she meant.  Here goes.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Now, did my son, Joey, get her pregnant?  Or is she pregnant holding my son, Joey?  The Joey that she talks about that's already living...  Right.  ...is the same Joey that she's saying she might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  Get it?  Has she been having sex with my son, Joey? 
[00:39:00]  Or is she pregnant with my son, Joey?  Joey's alive already.  Okay.  But now she's talking like Joey's not alive yet.  Right.  Okay.  I'm afraid that I might be pregnant with Anthony's son, Joey.  And I don't think so, but don't tell Grammy White, okay?  Daddy, tell Mom to get out of my apartment.  I'm not in bed with Anthony's son, Joey.  Oh, see?  Maybe she's having sex with Joey.  Ma is a liar. 
[00:39:30]  I have to stop now.  Love, Lynn.  So I was bragging, like, look at what I got today.  And Anthony got a letter from the same lady today.  Fan mail from some flounder.  Ha ha.  Yeah, I got the same one.  Dear Anthony,  I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  Now...  I don't have any daughters.  Wait, wait.  If she's calling you daddy...  Right.  Apparently she believes she's your daughter and she's pregnant with Joey. 
[00:40:00]  Joey, so...  Wait, she's my daughter, so I'm daddy?  Yeah.  But then who are you?  I'm...  Wait, does she start your letter off, hi, daddy?  You're my father-in-law.  How does your letter start?  Dear Anthony,  I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top.  She's your daughter.  I'm daddy, she's my daughter.  And you're dodging her.  Wait, all right, so wait, daddy, I want to have Anthony's son, Joey, move in with me. 
[00:40:30]  So how are you related to this?  This is like a goddamn David Lynch movie.  It makes no sense.  I think she's married to you, Anthony.  She's married to me?  She's married to you?  You had this son, Joey, that she wants to, um...  Uh, I don't know.  Well, let me finish mine, and perhaps it'll open up a whole world of, uh...  Maybe the listeners can help us.  All right, start over.  Dear Anthony, I'm getting scared if Opie finds out that his daughter is pregnant, he will blow his top. 
[00:41:00]  I'm going for an upper GI Thursday.  Anthony, I love your son, Joey, so much.  He is my angel.  Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey, the special love he wants.  Anthony, I might be having my Dalmatian Rocky move in with me.  I am very lonesome with my dog.  I want to ask my daddy if he could lend me 15 bucks.  Is Opie your daddy?  Is that what she says?  She wants 15 bucks from you, Opie? 
[00:41:30]  I used...  I used the $175 you gave me, Anthony.  I'm afraid of my daddy.  Can you write to me?  I am very, very sorry for not writing to you.  And my daddy.  I feel bad.  I will write to you and dad often as possible.  Take care, love, Lynn.  And according to the photo, how old would you make her?  At least 50.  She looks like she's... 
[00:42:00]  52.  Is that what you're guessing?  I'll go 52.  52.  I'm thinking because of her appearance, she might be younger than she looks,  but it's no younger than very late 40s.  Okay.  But, okay, I'll go with the late 40s, early 50s.  She is overweight.  She is old and matronly looking.  And she's wearing a house dress standing in front of a wall.  Big ass house dresses.  And she does.  Looks like... 
[00:42:30]  What's her face?  She's there from the Stephen King movie.  Wonderful.  She just looks...  I hate crazy people.  Why are you working with us?  I love them, yeah, right?  You don't understand.  I have no tolerance for the mentally challenged.  I just...  They really annoy me.  Well, this woman is totally...  She's a nut.  Out of her bird.  And, lo and behold, we have her on the phone.  Yes, we do.  Maybe now, Opie, we can get an answer. 
[00:43:00]  Who's daddy?  Where is my son, Joey?  And is he alive?  Is he pregnant?  Who's her father?  Is it you?  Well, Jim has figured out the relationship.  Oh, thank God.  Jim.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah.  Help us out here.  Opie, you're her daddy, right?  All right.  I think we got that.  All right.  All right.  Anthony is Joey's daddy, and she's banging him.  You're banging...  She's banging Joey?  She's banging your son, Joey.  Hmm.  I...  So, Mike is saying on line one, Ant is his own grandfather. 
[00:43:30]  I missed the middle of the reading from the delay, but I'm pretty sure that's what I got.  Okay.  Anthony, I love your son, Joey.  I love your son, Joey, so much.  He is my angel.  It sounds more motherly than Opie has no say in the matter.  I will give your son, Joey, the special love he wants.  See, it's your son.  Oh, so she...  I think Lynn has been cheating on me with Anthony.  No, no, no.  And he had more on father.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So, wait a minute.  So, my son, Joey... 
[00:44:00]  Exactly.  Is banging Lynn.  Opie's...  Could be Opie's son-in-law at some point if they hook up.  There you go.  So, what does that make you two to each other?  That's what we're trying to figure out.  Well...  I don't know.  Would you...  Well, you're both fathers, but you're...  All right.  Well, she's on the line.  Let's talk to her.  Oh, let's.  Thank you, Jim.  I can't wait.  Bye, guys.  All right.  So, here's Lynn.  If they...  Oh, my God.  It takes forever to put them on hold.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  Here we go.  Hey, Lynn.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Great.  You know, we got your letters. 
[00:44:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we've been reading them, Lynn.  Mm-hmm.  And they're good letters.  Very good letters.  Good, good, good letters.  Mm-hmm.  You did good writing them, Lynn.  Mm-hmm.  Good letter writing.  Good letter writing.  We just want to know a couple of things, Lynn.  Uh-huh.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Who is your daddy?  Anthony.  But, but, see, Lynn.  Uh-huh.  Opie got the letter that said, that was addressed to daddy.  Uh-huh. 
[00:45:00]  So, I thought...  I made a mistake.  I meant to put to Anthony, you know.  Okay.  So, I...  That was my mistake.  I had just woken up when I woke up.  Oh, okay.  That's okay, Lynn.  Everything's good.  Mm-hmm.  Now, I'm your father?  Mm-hmm.  Oh!  All right.  How old of a girl are you, Lynn?  How old are you, Lynn?  I'm 41.  You're 41?  Mm-hmm.  And that's your father?  That's good.  I'm her daddy.  You're 60 years?  I have no idea. 
[00:45:30]  Now, Lynn, who is Opie to you?  He is my boyfriend's dad.  Your boyfriend's dad.  And your boyfriend is...  His name is George.  His name is George.  He's glad.  His name is Joey.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Anthony is...  Yeah.  You're...  I'm Lynn's father, Opie.  So, you're 60.  I'm Joey's father?  Yes.  Which means you're going out with a kid that's got to be...  How old is...  I...  How old is...  Joey is 37.  Joey's 37. 
[00:46:00]  Opie, you're about 57 years old.  I'm probably going to be 42 years old next month.  Oh, you are.  Yeah.  So, I'm about 57 and it's about 60.  Uh-huh.  When did you sleep with a rhinoceros, Anthony?  You got it.  I don't remember that.  Now, Lynn...  Uh-huh.  If I'm your father, who's your mommy?  My mother's first name is Nancy.  Nancy and I apparently had a relationship with Nancy.  Yes.  And we had sex. 
[00:46:30]  I guess.  And you were born.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  I don't know.  I'm also hearing, Lynn, that you have a baby due in August?  Yeah.  And Anthony is not too happy about it.  You know, and...  Why am I not happy?  I'm ecstatic, Lynn.  Yeah.  Number one.  First of all, I love Joey like he was my own.  Dad.  And you know something?  That you're having Joey's baby is a very good thing. 
[00:47:00]  Be quiet.  She wants to talk to her daddy.  Okay.  Talk to daddy, Lynn.  Okay.  Thanks.  Go ahead, Lynn.  Hi, Dad.  Hi, Lynn.  How have you been?  I miss you.  I know.  I miss you too, Dad.  But, um, you know, I'm going to leave your apartment.  I can't live here with you anymore.  I'm just going to take my dog and Joey.  I'm just going to leave.  No.  Please don't go, Lynn.  I need you around.  You're my daughter.  Dad. 
[00:47:30]  Number one.  Yes.  I'm 41 years old.  Okay.  Let me leave.  You're still my little girl, Lynn.  You're still my little girl.  Dad, I understand that.  You're daddy's little girl, Lynn.  Why do you upset me like this?  Why?  I'm sorry.  Why do you upset me?  Dad.  Oh, my God.  You're my little girl.  I'm sorry, Dad.  I'm sorry.  Does the dog talk to you, Lynn? 
[00:48:00]  No, Dad.  No.  Daddy wants to see you naked.  No, Dad.  I don't think so.  I don't think so, Dad.  Daddy's home.  Daddy, please.  Your daddy's home.  Daddy.  Stay.  Dad, listen to me, okay?  Okay, Lynn.  For an example, when we were at Aunt Mary's yesterday.  I remember yesterday.  It was yesterday.  Oh, yesterday, yes.  I told Rick this.  Rick is really upset, okay?  Yes, what happened?  Number one, when I got into your car yesterday, and I had my hair long and curly, you know that. 
[00:48:30]  It's so cute.  Listen, listen, Daddy, okay?  Yes, okay, Dawn.  Number one, Daddy.  You turned around, and you told me that I look like a witch because I had my hair long  and I didn't put it up.  No, a good witch.  I meant, Lynn, Lynn, damn you.  I meant like Sabrina, the teenage witch.  Daddy.  She's cute.  Daddy.  I'm sorry, Lynn.  I was drinking.  You embarrassed me yesterday, Daddy.  I was drinking, Lynn, like when I had sex with Nancy and had you.  Daddy, Dad, I just can't live here with you anymore. 
[00:49:00]  Please stay, Lynn.  Daddy never wanted you, Lynn.  Yeah.  You shut up.  I realized that.  Your son, Joey, is corrupting Lynn.  I realized that.  Is Joey treating you nice, Lynn?  Yes, Daddy.  Number one, we had gone out Saturday.  He took me out to the outback, and we had such a good time.  Hey, Lynn, but the baby you're carrying is not Joey's, is it?  Yes, it is, Dad.  No, this is your father. 
[00:49:30]  Dad, it was.  It is not.  It is not.  It is not Joey's.  The baby you're carrying is Satan's.  Daddy, no.  It's Satan's child.  I knew it.  I knew it.  It's the devil's child, Lynn.  Rick was right.  Rick was right, Daddy.  Rick was right.  What?  What did Rick say?  Rick had told me that, you know, that I could have the baby, you know.  Rick is wrong.  Rick told me that.  And now Rick must die.  I just shot Rick.  I just shot Rick. 
[00:50:00]  Dad, Rick told me that.  Since I'm 41 years old, I have my life.  I can do what I want, okay?  I'm not your little girl anymore, Daddy.  I'm 41 years old.  I want you to have an abortion.  Okay?  I want you to have an abortion and get rid of Joe's baby.  No, Daddy.  I'm not giving up Opie's baby.  Suck it out with a Hoover vacuum if you have to.  Wait, hold on.  Opie's baby?  Is it Opie's baby?  It's Opie's son's baby.  Opie's son's baby.  Well, my son cannot.  Dad!  Number one.  My son cannot get with you anymore.  What, Lynn?  There's no way in hell I'll give this baby up. 
[00:50:30]  I'm, Dad, you have no say in this matter, okay?  I'm going to call the government and they're going to take the baby away.  Daddy, they can't.  The government is going to take it away unless you put tinfoil on your head and keep the  signals from reaching your brain, Lynn.  Put the tinfoil on your head, Lynn.  Quickly.  The government will find you.  Lynn, Lynn, quickly put tinfoil on your head.  Do you have tinfoil there?  No.  Lynn.  That's in my dad's cupboard.  Lynn, quickly, get tinfoil, please.  Can you do this for me?  No.  Lynn, please, my little girl, get tinfoil and put it on your head. 
[00:51:00]  What?  To keep the government's signals from reaching your brain.  Dad, come on.  Why, do I sound crazy?  Dad, you're drinking again, won't you?  Yes, I'm drinking.  That's right, Bill.  That's like I was when I touched you, Lynn, when you were child.  Do you remember when I touched you?  I'm so sorry.  Right, Dad.  Right.  Oh, another thing, too, Dad.  Okay?  Oh, another thing, okay.  Yeah, listen to this.  Yeah.  Okay?  Yeah.  And I'm going to tell Opie this, and I'm going to make sure he tells you.  All right.  Number one, Daddy, I had $175, okay, for my payroll check. 
[00:51:30]  Hey, you turn around, and you took $60 off me.  I needed it.  Bear up, Daddy.  I needed it.  I needed it.  I needed it for gas.  Can you say three rights make a left, by the way?  What?  Yeah, you got two jobs.  Yeah, you got two jobs, okay, number one.  Number two, you have two good paychecks, okay, and you took $60 out of my wallet that day.  Dad, and that's all I had to listen to until this week.  You know, Tuttle from New York checked in and said, Opie's son, Joey, his father makes $130 million, and he only takes you to the Outback. 
[00:52:00]  He is a cheap bastard.  Yeah.  We had such a good time, okay?  Yes.  Didn't we have fun, my daughter?  Dad.  Yeah.  Daddy, please.  Okay, you don't understand what my point is, okay?  What do you want from me?  What I want is I want you to write me a letter, okay, saying that I want you to write the people downstairs in the office from upstairs from where you live,  explaining to them that I want my dog to move in with me, you, and I'm with me, and you. 
[00:52:30]  I want a letter written.  No pets allowed.  Huh?  Dad.  I don't know.  The dog is evil.  Daddy, no, you don't understand, okay?  The dog is evil.  Dad.  We are bringing the dog to the pound.  No.  The dog is going to the pound.  I want my dog to move in with us.  The dog's going to the dog pound.  I'm coming and picking him up and taking him down to the dog pound where he'll be gassed.  Daddy, please.  I want one of you.  Shut up and listen to your father.  Please, Daddy.  Can you walk in with us?  No. 
[00:53:00]  No.  He can't.  No.  Lynn, know why he can't?  Why?  The dog is dead.  Daddy.  No.  Just because you're over here to crush your butt, okay?  Listen to your father.  Don't blame it on me, okay?  Dad, please.  I want Rocky to move in with in here, okay?  What?  You want to go to the moon, what?  I said I want Rocky to move in here.  Hey, what kind of medication do you want?  I want to have my dog in your apartment.  Hey, Lynn.  What?  What kind of medication do you want?  I'm only on breath in for my asthma. 
[00:53:30]  What?  I have asthma, okay?  Yeah.  And I want breath in for my asthma.  Nothing for the wacky thoughts in your head?  I don't have wacky thoughts.  Knock on wood.  Hey, Lynn, we can go down to the free clinic and get one of those abortions.  Dad, please.  Okay, no.  You're not giving me.  No way.  I'm not giving up Joey's baby.  The power of Christ compels you.  Yeah, I don't believe in that.  The power of Christ compels you.  Yeah, I don't believe in that.  The power of Christ compels you. 
[00:54:00]  The power of Christ compels you.  Dad, I don't believe in that.  No, I really don't.  Hey.  Dad.  What?  The only thing I'm asking you to do very nicely is...  No!  If you can write the Burlington Housing Authority a letter...  Nope.  ...saying that you gave your daughter permission to have my dog moving on me.  The dog is dead.  Dad.  No, the dog is dead.  No.  Daddy, Grammy is a beautiful dog.  No, no, no, no.  I can't believe for that.  You'll get nothing like it. 
[00:54:30]  You want me to smack you again?  No.  I'll smack you.  No, okay.  I'll smack that smile off your face.  That retarded grin.  Fine, Dad.  I got your picture right here.  This is your brother Jim.  This is your brother Jim.  Would you please give the dog a Hummer and then put a pistol in your fat mouth?  Daddy, please.  Can we help Rocky move in here with us?  Did you kill two Colombians any time?  All right.  Just checking.  That's a bit.  No.  We will let Rocky move in with you? 
[00:55:00]  As long as you let Daddy come into your room again tonight.  No.  No.  Oh, yeah.  No way.  You look awful sexy in this dress.  I'm looking at the picture.  Daddy.  I'll lift that up and put my head under there like a 17th century photographer.  Daddy.  Daddy.  I'm only asking this one favor.  No.  No, darling.  I'm going to keep asking you.  I won't walk you in here.  No.  Well, then can we get a small dog?  No.  We'll talk about it tonight when I slip into your bed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'll feel my beard and my whiskey breath against the back of your tender neck. 
[00:55:30]  Right, Dad.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to come by tomorrow and punch you in the stomach to get rid of that baby.  Dad, one other thing, too.  Okay?  What?  Dad.  What?  One other thing, too.  What?  You gave me a list.  I thought she was going to click up and go, like, that's going to hang up on us.  Dad, you gave me $175.  You gave me $125.  Yes, I did.  Well, you made me a list of what to get you for your food.  I went out with my payroll check. 
[00:56:00]  I spent over $186.  So?  Good.  Just because you wanted it, you know?  I'll wait for you.  You know what I need, Lynn?  Yeah.  Lynn, you know what I need?  And I'll let you keep the dog if you do this.  I'll write the letter so you can keep the dog, Lynn.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  Go to the supermarket.  Yeah.  All right?  How much money do you have on you right now?  $25.  $25.  I need $25 worth of gum out of the gumball machine.  For what reason?  I just need it.  Make sure you get nickels or whatever you need. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, I will.  To do it.  $25 worth of a bag.  I'll mail you out.  I'll mail you out.  I'll mail you out.  I'll mail you out.  I'll mail you out.  I'll mail you out.  I'll mail you out.  Will that be okay to get it yourself?  No, you have to get it.  And how am I going to give it to you?  How am I mail it or whatever?  I'm going to come there tonight.  And you better have the gumballs or I'll kill the dog.  Dad, you're not touching, Walkie.  Oh, dear.  You're not going there, Walkie.  No way.  I'll kill the dog.  Dad, you're not going there, Walkie.  Dad.  You're not going there, Walkie.  I'm alone.  Hey, Lynn.  Lynn.  Lynn.  What?  You are a frigging lunatic. 
[00:57:00]  You're insane.  Did you know that?  Oh, really?  You're crazy.  Yeah.  I'm not your father.  Opie isn't the father of your boyfriend.  You're a kooky woman that needs medication.  Yeah, right.  Why don't you go to the hospital?  But I am your brother and I do want you to drink from the dog's mule and then commit suicide.  No way.  You're crazy.  You're a little wacky there, Lynn.  You're crazy.  No way.  What do you do for a living, Lynn?  I used to work for Papaginos.  Papaginos.  And that's the lousy job I left here all about.  And then what? 
[00:57:30]  And after that, I got pregnant and here I am.  What?  What happened?  I left my job, got pregnant.  You got pregnant?  What did they do with the kid?  My dad is in my stomach.  What?  Never mind.  Where's your kid, Lynn?  Dead in her stomach?  Dad.  Dead?  No.  I said daddy.  No.  Daddy home.  No.  Yeah, think about it.  Okay?  You know?  Where's your kid?  I'm due in August, daddy.  No, you're not.  I'm due in August.  I'm not pregnant. 
[00:58:00]  No one's banging you, Lynn.  No one's had sex with you.  So how are you going to have a kid?  You don't think so, daddy?  How are you going to have a kid?  You don't think so, daddy?  Not with my little girl.  Only I get to do that.  Daddy, don't even start.  Okay?  I'll start again.  Yeah, don't start.  The baby's mine, Lynn.  The baby is mine.  It's your father's baby inside you.  No way.  Yes, it is.  I have no, dad.  I don't even want to, you know.  Didn't I tell you not to call daddy at work? 
[00:58:30]  Yes, dad.  Didn't I tell you?  I know that.  I know that.  What's the punishment?  I know that.  What's the punishment for that, Lynn?  Dad, I know I don't want to call you on your other job.  What's the punishment, baby?  What's the punishment, baby?  Dad, I know you don't want me calling you at your other job.  Okay?  I understand that.  Yes.  I haven't called you at your other job.  You have to suck daddy's mule.  Yes.  Suck the mule, Lynn.  Get redemption and suck the mule.  Dad, I haven't called you at work. 
[00:59:00]  It's almost two and a half weeks now, okay?  Don't call daddy at work.  Huh?  Or I have to come there and put my mule in your face.  Oh, I doubt it, dad.  I doubt it.  Yes.  Yeah, the only thing I know is I want to get out of your apartment.  That's all I want to know.  So leave.  I don't want you there.  Thank you.  I don't want you there.  I have your permission to leave, right?  Get out!  I have your permission to leave, right?  Lynn, we've got to let you go.  Yeah.  Go get some medication.  Yep.  Okay.  Go to the hospital.  Mm-hmm.  Right now. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, right.  See how crazy you are?  Yeah, right.  Okay.  I'm coming home tonight.  I want you out of that place by the time I get home.  Dad, you won't come up yet, I guarantee it.  Bye.  Bye.  Leave.  Okay, bye, dad.  Leave that house.  Yeah, you don't think you really think you're doing it.  Leave that house.  Pack up and leave right now, because when I get home tonight, I don't want to see you there.  Okay.  Okay?  Yep.  Good.  Leave.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  It's called thinning the herd if she walks out in front of a bus or something.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Don't you just, I hate crazy people. 
[01:00:00]  What a lunatic.  First, her whole letter is backwards, because then it turns out that I'm a daddy, and Opie  is the father of the kid that she's going out with.  Right.  And the kid is 37 years old.  Yeah.  You know what's annoying?  If she was hot, you know how easy she'd be to bang?  That's the beauty.  I know.  Why can't hot chicks be this crazy?  Why do crazy people have to love eating so much?  Ugh.  Because if she was hot, that call would have went completely different.  Yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Why don't you take your panties off right now?  Get on a train.  Get off in Penn Station.  Get completely naked.  Now leave your house.  Go ahead.  Just walk down the street.  They're always fat with a house dress and that thousand-yard marine stare.  That's so annoying.  Oh, God.  A thousand-yard.  Hi, Joker.  Just looking through walls with her x-ray vision.  Awful fat.  Wowie kazowie.  That was nuts.  She really is irritating.  She's got some problems. 
[01:01:00]  A few issues.  I'm not your daddy.  Then a middle-yarder, my daddy.  I went to dog to the house.  Daddy, no.  No, daddy.  I got no tolerance.  I really, really.  I'm not talking about retarded people.  I'm talking about nuts.  Retarded people I empathize with, but nuts I just cannot stomach.  All right.  I don't know what we did right there, but that was a little bit of fun.  We did something.  It started as an idea.  I have a dream.  Then the people got behind it.  United, there is little we cannot do. 
[01:01:30]  Now we can all live the dream.  It's Whip-A-Mount Wednesday.  Keeping the dream alive.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:02:00]  Andrew, W.K.  Party hard.  So, Ann, did I tell you that I went to see E.T. this weekend?  People are going to cave their radios in. 
[01:02:30]  What?  I felt like I would share with everyone.  Right.  So, what did you think of the added scenes and, uh, I don't know.  Which scenes were added?  I don't even know.  I guess a bathtub scene and...  Right.  And, uh, walkie-talkies.  Yes, instead of guns on the children.  Which looked completely ridiculous because they were holding walkie-talkies like you would hold a gun.  Oh, really? 
[01:03:00]  All right.  Speaking of, uh, partying hard, our pal Anthony was in the news over the break.  He was?  Who?  Anthony who?  You, Ann.  Two and a half years, you're a single man.  You're officially divorced.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The big D.  Yes.  Why is Colin Quinn calling?  He's got a show on, uh, television.  Yeah.  He's got a show.  It's been on a couple weeks now.  It's very, very funny. 
[01:03:30]  Look.  Look.  Look.  What?  I figured...  What?  What are you doing?  I...  I...  I...  I had the number.  I know his show is tonight.  I figured I would call up Colin and talk to him a little.  Well, hold on, man.  What?  He's very limited.  No way.  He's got time, dude.  He's got to get him on quick.  I just want to make it perfectly clear to our fine, faithful listeners that Opie has  nothing to do with this stall tactic today.  This is not a stall.  Colin is a very good friend of ours, and I just, for the moment, decided, hey, I want 
[01:04:00]  to talk to Colin Quinn.  He's got a show.  He's going to be on tonight, and they're rehearsing and stuff, Opie, so it's a live program, so he's  very pressed for time.  We have to fit him in now.  And Norton's going to be on.  Norton's going to be on with Colin Quinn again tonight?  I think Norton has blown us off.  He killed on Colin Quinn last week.  Yeah.  I think it's over.  I don't think he's going to be back with us.  Well, we can't wait.  I can't make a huge NBC star wait.  Hey, Colin. 
[01:04:30]  How are you doing?  Hey, Colin.  Hi, guys.  Hey.  Hi, guys.  How are the rehearsals going?  They're going pretty good, actually.  You guys aren't going to give me the silent treatment right now, are you?  No, we don't do that.  No, we won't do that.  Not to you.  Not to Colin Quinn.  Well, again.  You see, I went to Notting Hill this weekend.  It was fantastic.  Sensational.  Notting Hill.  Sucked.  Hey, Colin.  Colin, is it true that Brewer's going to be on the show tonight?  Yeah, that jackass is here rehearsing.  He'll be on.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:05:00]  I hear you guys are working on a bit together.  We really are.  And, you know, he's a fine actor.  A lot of people don't realize that about you.  Academy Award winner.  I think.  In the future, sometime.  And a little Jimmy Norton's going to be on again tonight?  Oh, Jimmy.  Matter of fact, you're sitting right here with me.  Jimmy.  Oh, just two guys having fun funneling each other.  Hey, Colin, did you hear that Anthony got divorced over vacation?  No, I read this whole scandalous thing.  He's my hero now because it was some big three-way. 
[01:05:30]  God damn.  Colin was reading that, too?  He's supposed to say GD.  Believe me, we're going to read the article, and it's quite saucy.  I read it.  It was really quite enjoyable.  A little saucy.  Oof.  Who knew?  It's a real zinger.  Who knew?  Can you make reference to it on the show tonight, Colin?  Oh, I'll certainly try.  I'd rather reenact it.  Isn't that why you brought in Brewer? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, Brewer's wife.  You, Norton, and Brewer.  Three men reenacting a threesome.  Is that true, Jim?  We're going to reenact with you that threesome?  Anthony's threesome he had once?  Once, twice, what, Harold?  Anthony's my idol for that one.  I'm not fessing up.  He's not?  No.  Yeah, I know.  You had to close the case of music.  Hey, let's keep that kind of smart out of court.  You know what?  I'd be saying, yeah, let's hear some details about my prowess. 
[01:06:30]  Instead, what do I have?  A couple of incidents of the tranny when I was 19 that I'm trying to cover up to this day.  That's what Ant said earlier.  He's like, thank God it played out like it did, and it wasn't like, you know, oh, my God,  they're going to find out about the young boys, or it's going to be in the paper that, you  know, so, Anthony, when you had three men in the bed with you, like, how do you go back  to work after that?  All right.  How did you, Colin?  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Well, it was right there.  You're very busy, aren't you?  Very Greco-Roman, I'll say that.  It's like the original Olympics.  We were after it.  Exactly.  A Greco-Roman joke today.  Nice.  So, Norton, very, very funny last week, and look at that, he's been invited back.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Hey, what's the buzz you got going?  Are they going to give you some more episodes?  Oh, who the hell knows?  Because how many were you signed for?  Three.  We were signed for three, which is the kind of vote of confidence I inspire in these people.  And now, but I did notice something which I'm going to bring up on the air about Norton, 
[01:07:30]  is that he has Kid Rock's chin, and I don't mean that as a compliment.  Kid Rock's chin.  Yeah.  Isn't that non-existent?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's no chin.  It's a terrible chin, and you get the same stubble growth as Kid Rock.  And the same Hepatitis C.  You should have seen where to stop me trying to do, like, Hepatitis C AIDS jokes about  Pamela Lee.  I was like, Jim, you only had three weeks.  You doesn't care. 
[01:08:00]  Look at you.  Yeah, you got to be the responsible one.  I know.  It's sad when I'm the yuppie of the two.  Oh, they'll sink you in a second, then just walk away like, oh, well, it was supposed  to last.  You know, it's your life.  Yeah.  They'll be like, hey, it was a try, guys, right?  Yeah, right.  You're sunken, you bastard.  And Rosie O'Donnell last week, Colleen, she did well.  We're not, you know what, we've said it on the show many times, we're not big fans of  Rosie, but she was cool on your show.  You're right.  She seemed like one of the boys.  Oh, man.  No, I mean, she was hanging, and she was dishing out some blue material. 
[01:08:30]  A little blue, a little racy?  Oh, yeah.  Not as saucy as your stuff, Anthony.  Not as saucy as some testimony?  And I were going to really let them have it, guys, believe me.  I mean, I don't want to, I don't want to please people watch, but you'll really have a heck  of a dime.  And believe me, if you can't watch us, at least watch Just Shoot Me beforehand.  They're going to have some heavy stuff on there, so I can imagine.  Quite provocative, indeed.  When they get down and dirty on that show, I don't know what the hell to do.  Yes.  Hey, is Seinfeld going to throw you a bone tonight, Colleen? 
[01:09:00]  And come on?  Yeah.  No.  No?  In Los Angeles.  You know, all right, I gave a little compliment to the program.  Yeah, but I got to tell the fine folks something, man.  Colleen and Seinfeld, a big friend of Colleen's.  Yeah.  He's been at the shows the last two Mondays.  You'd think he would walk out on stage and help his pal Colleen.  Oh, he's been there?  Just walk past Colleen as he's doing his monologue and wave.  Like, oh, look who's there.  Jerry.  Yeah, Jerry, as you call him.  Jerry doesn't feel that the time is right. 
[01:09:30]  But Jerry says when the time is appropriate, he will make an appearance.  Ah.  Fascinating.  Look, it's me.  I'm walking on.  I'm doing a walk-on.  All right, where's Norton?  We've got to say hi to him.  Okay, you guys.  Thanks a lot.  Here's Norton.  Best of luck.  Hello?  Jim, I've got to tell you something.  Is this Opie in my new favorite personal life?  How you doing, Norton?  Hey, hello, sir.  Hey, how are you?  I'm blessed.  Great.  Uh, Jim, you better be funny because we were supposed to talk about Anthony's divorce 
[01:10:00]  during this.  Yeah, I was supposed to read some saucy, uh, articles that came out.  But it seems like you have perfect timing.  You called.  Uh, I, well, to be honest with you, I, I was going to do a really funny, um, uh, Pam Anderson  Hep C joke, but, you know, thanks to the host for gobbling that one up for me.  A little too, uh, a little too much over the line there.  Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to, look, dude, dude, I, I just wanted to call people to encourage  them to watch the show tonight, um, this has nothing to do with town hall April 18th.  Oh, God, I forgot about it over, uh, vacation. 
[01:10:30]  Why don't you just write on your forehead tonight, Jim?  Dude, if I could get away with that, believe me, I would.  Yeah.  But I'd probably put a wow sticker because it's about us, not me.  Hey, Jim.  Yeah.  How was it, uh, working with Rosie?  You know what?  No, it was funny.  You were making faces when Rosie was doing her thing because you were right in front of  Rosie.  Like, ugh.  You know what?  Rosie was really nice to me.  I actually liked her because we were talking off air and she was extremely nice to me.  Yeah.  I'm such a little wormy dirtbag.  Look at you kissing ass.  Jim, are you, uh, quitting our show now that you're, uh, hanging out with your new friends 
[01:11:00]  on, uh, the Colin Quinn show?  No, not at all.  No, not at all.  Until, you know, it gets picked up.  You know, you don't burn bridges before the ones are built.  I don't know.  Hey, hey, I'm...  Burden the hand.  What's that?  Burden the hand.  What, uh, material are you doing today?  Are you going to do some of that, uh, E.T. material?  Uh, no, I...  First of all, you went and saw E.T., I know.  Yeah.  And, uh, perfect setup, by the way.  Yeah.  I have no desire to see it unless there's a different ending. 
[01:11:30]  And instead of going home, he's drowned in a bathtub in Houston.  That's my only E.T. joke.  Right.  And that probably won't get through the censors.  Pam Anderson joke was good.  What was that?  Uh, the key, well, you know, it won't be funny now, because we've already discussed it,  but, uh, Pam Anderson wants to date a bad boy like, uh, Tommy Lee, and she gets Hep C.  That's what you get.  You could have went with a guy like me and had AIDS.  Um, and there's no way that's getting through, uh, the network censors.  Of course not. 
[01:12:00]  That's funny, though.  Colin just said, unless I can prove I had AIDS.  You know, it's based on some kind of fact.  I'm trying to show a different side of myself.  I don't want to just do AIDS jokes.  Right.  I apologize.  That's why you're bringing the Hep C joke in.  It's nice.  You've got to be married.  Multi-faceted diseases.  Very good.  Norton, I'm catching up on the email, because we were on break, and a lot of people just  rave reviews for, uh, for your appearance on Colin last week.  Yep.  It was.  Uh, it's, it's great to be able to, to be honest, to be able to do a tip material on television, 
[01:12:30]  man, because any other network show would never allow you.  Yeah.  To even touch on terrorism or anything like that.  And the only thing they're basically doing on Colin's show is saying, all right, just  don't say c*****.  Anything else.  Wait a minute.  Look at you, back to your clever self.  Just don't say, uh, the C word.  It's their line.  They, they have given so much freedom, which is materialized in, uh, everybody.  As much as I don't like Keith and Patrice personally, the stuff they have is absolutely hilarious. 
[01:13:00]  And, uh, Joey Vega and Greg Gerardo, it's a great show.  Patrice doing the white guy thing the other, uh, night was hilarious.  It really was.  And I wanted to ugh at him, because he's not a good person.  Hey, uh, so Brewer, Brewer's helping you guys out tonight.  Yeah, they're working on a, uh, they were working on a sketch, um, it's, it's probably  going to be on.  The problem is with time.  I know that there was time constraints last week, and that's a problem that they have  this week, too.  Just hard with live TV.  Yeah.  So you never know exactly what's going to happen on it, because of the, uh, the time. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I'm hoping to see a closing credit this week.  That would be nice.  What happened last week?  I think something just ran wrong, and again, with live TV, you know, uh, you know, the TV  people are not exactly very caring about artistic value.  It's like, all right, it's over.  Talk, talk.  Right.  Um, but then Colin didn't care.  Why do you need goodbye?  I mean, you know, you saw the sketches.  Everything funny had been done.  Why do you want to watch him waving?  You've seen enough of him.  The show just ends.  That's the way it works.  He gives you brilliantly funny material, and that's it.  Go.  Uh, Jim, do you have anything on Ant's divorce?  Because, uh, that's what we were supposed to talk about here. 
[01:14:00]  No, um, I have nothing on, I wouldn't even have thought of writing a joke about Ant's  divorce unless you guys brought it up.  I'm not that comfortable in studio yet.  He'll have to be in here, I think.  That's all I can picture is mentioning.  So, how about that divorce article and having Ant look at me and really, well, I'm glad  I have a mailing list.  All right, guys, have a good show, man.  Uh, for those of you who watched, oh, Colin wants to say one more thing.  Yes.  And I don't really plug my own TV appearances, because, you know, who cares?  But this one I just watched, because, you know, support Colin's show, man. 
[01:14:30]  This is like the one edgy guy on television.  And let me put Sweetie back on the phone.  I'll see you guys in a while.  All right.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Just the reason Anthony is a hero is not because he got two girls to do a freeway.  Anyone can do that.  It's going to get two girls to do a freeway while he was an air conditioner repairman.  Did that come out?  Is that in the article, too?  Yes.  It is?  Yes.  Wow.  I missed that part.  It's going on.  Very good.  You know how it is.  Colin, there's your opening joke. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Great.  I'll see you guys later.  Thanks.  All right, Colin.  Thanks.  Colin Quinn, tonight, 930 on NBC.  Yeah, support the show, because the last thing I want to see is Colin walking back into  another OTB with his hot tips.  You know what I mean?  It's kind of...  You know, when we first saw Colin a while back on the streets.  Yeah, we've seen him come full circle, yes.  I'm like, here's Colin Quinn, this guy SNL.  You know, I remember him from Remote Control.  Very funny comic.  He had a great run on SNL.  Next thing you know, he's running out of the Brooklyn Diner.  Say hi to him.  Hey, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:15:30]  How are you guys doing?  Look, I've got to get the OTB.  I've got a great tip.  Oh, this thing's a winner, man.  Go down.  Do it now.  Don't tell no one.  You'll push the odds down.  And then that Irish bar we did lunch at one day, he happened to be in there.  He comes running back in to tell us the tip, and he's like...  Yeah, it's a great tip.  I only get the best tips.  You know, I would never tell anybody unless it was a good tip.  Just don't tell anyone else.  Push the odds down.  I've got to make a buck.  All right.  Jock shocks in court. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, we have to take a break now.  Oh, Jesus.  It's not my fault.  Holy smokes.  It's not my fault.  Look, you know something?  You're running out of phone calls, dude.  At first, I was seeing people emailing and calling, and it was all good, clean, let's  goof on Opie and Anthony because they're stretching this out kind of fun.  Right.  Now I am seeing genuine hatred of us for doing this.  We're going to blow off Colin?  No.  We didn't know he was calling there.  Come on.  It's not like we, you know, plan this stuff. 
[01:16:30]  Be patient, people.  It's not like we have a schedule in front of us.  It's 520.  Talk about Ant's divorce.  I mean, yes.  Actually, you know what?  We would do it right now.  But look, Ben's freaking out.  Ben, what's wrong?  I know.  Ben.  Ben, what's wrong?  We're late with commercials?  Commercials.  He's saying, yeah, and he means it.  Commercials.  Oh, you know what?  Seriously, though, I wanted to finish up the Jim Norton thing.  I wanted to play.  It's like, what, a minute? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  This was part of what Jim had to say on the Colin Quinn show.  We're pretty proud of him.  Last Monday night, and he's on tonight with Brewer and a bunch of the guys you know and love from this show.  A lot of them are on our show.  Okay, here it is.  Jim Norton from the Colin Quinn show.  Without forcing diversity, this next guy would be alone forever.  Jim.  First of all, I'm starting to feel really guilty for mooing at her and her friend. 
[01:17:30]  Here's the problem I have with diversity.  In theory, it's good.  In practice, it sucks because it affects things like humor.  All in the family, brilliant show.  You could never do that again today because the language wouldn't be accepted.  Archie would get mad at Meathead.  He'd call him a Polack.  If you said that now, the next morning you'd have 10,000 Polish people outside protesting in front of the wrong network.  And people really tend to allow you to address issues in films that you cannot address in humor. 
[01:18:00]  If you make a film about retarded people, it's acceptable if you address it in humor.  You're very insensitive.  People will come up to you.  Don't make fun of retarded people.  That's sick.  Meanwhile, Tom Hanks runs around for two and a half hours.  I love you, Jenny.  That is a genius.  Why does every actor have to play a retarded guy?  Tom Hanks did it.  Sean Penn did it.  Juliette Lewis did it.  Keanu Reeves does it accidentally in every film.  There, Derek, is a word. 
[01:18:30]  Beat, beat, beat.  Among us, beat.  There is no corresponding meaning.  Double, double.  But it seems to mean something.  Beat, beat, beat.  To you human.  Captain.  Watch, watch, watch.  We are being pro.  Ow!  What is that word?  Wow.  We hope you're there for the show.  We hope you're there for the show. 
[01:19:00]  I'm back in the sun again.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back in the sun again.  I'm back. 
[01:19:30]  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I'm back.  I had to see you one last time 
[01:20:00]  There's something on my mind  How do I say what needs to be said  The words are hard to find  How about, bitch, give me my money 
[01:20:30]  I want my money and I want it fast  Hey, bitch, give me my money  Else I'm about to take it out your ass  Steven Lynch, we'll play that a hundred times  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:21:00]  Boom, off the hook today, Anthony  Yeah, they seem to want to talk  First day back from vacation  Chris, what's going on?

That's why we did it, Yuri  If your haircut took a little less time  We would have been able to get to the story  Yeah  It's in my shot there  We waited for you, Yuri  I hope you had a good haircut  It was alright  Thank you very much  Alright  Thank you  Len, what's going on?  Len  Hey, Tools  I got a new character for the show for you  Okay, ready? 
[01:22:30]  Anthony  Here we go  How was your weekend, buddy?  How's your game of Loser Quest going?  Oh, good  Hey, have you figured out which guy I am?  I'm staying for more time so Anthony doesn't have to get embarrassed, guys  Alright, we'll get to it  Hurry up  But if I said we get to it right now, you're not going to believe me  But we're going to get to it right this second  Doug from Springfield  What's up, guys?

You're killing me  I'm in that contractor's, like, atmospheric dilemma, you know  Right  The radio station comes in crystal clear in the car  Yeah  Well, you can't get it on in the house  Alright  Two and a half hours almost, man  I got three pieces of molding left to do  Get on with it  Boy, and you better have a good story to tell  Why?

[01:24:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh  Ouch  Everyone's funny  Well  Jock Shocks  In court, Opie  Yes  Okay  And Radio Raunch Man  Which one do we go to first?  I don't know  Do you want Jock Shocks in court?  Or Radio Raunch Man in R-rated Divorce?  How ridiculous is this?  I should  I should do a little preface  Go ahead 
[01:24:30]  I'm just trying to figure out  Which is the better story  Because you should save the better story for last  There was one in the Daily News  And one in the Post  And one in the New York Post  Last Wednesday, I think, came out  I think I will read the Post second  Right?  And someone pointed out to me  That hey, there's a Post reporter  In the courtroom  I'm like, alright  You know, because 
[01:25:00]  I'm pretty much just answering standard  Ridiculous questions  You know what I mean?  Standard divorce questions  Right  Things like that  We were supposed to be on trial  For the whole time we were on vacation  Yeah, yeah  It was supposed to last that long  So when I read these articles  In Killington  In between skiing  On Tuesday morning  I was quite surprised  Well this thing had gone on  For, you know  Two and a half years  Two and a half years  So they finally  You know, with the court system  The way it is  Which is ridiculous 
[01:25:30]  If I, for a second  My actual freedom of life  As far as being  Having to go to prison or something  Is in the hands of the court  Oh, you are screwed  Like, I am  I am so glad  You know, I'm not committing any real crime  Crimes on morality, apparently  But I'm not really committing any crime  Two girls for every boy  But  It just went on 
[01:26:00]  And it was supposed to be  All week during the vacation  That was going to be my vacation  Getting this done with  So day one is, you know, me  I get up there  And I'm being asked questions  It's all in the paper here  My wife's lawyer  The inimitable  I got to correct you  You're an ex-wife  At that point  My ex-wife's lawyer  The personality-filled  Dominic Barbara 
[01:26:30]  All right, sorry  Yes, Dominic Barbara  You may know him from  And, of course, his court TV show  That no one watched  Obviously  And, yeah

[01:27:30]  About  About very personal matters  Opie  Very personal matters  Of things that  Allegedly took place  No  Sex  No  Sex  Does group not imply  More than three?  More than two  More than two  No, I would always assume  Group would be four  All right  Then I got  We can do this one 
[01:28:00]  I would  Two girls for every ball  So there was a reporter  In the  There were a few reporters  I only knew there was one  But there seemed to have been two  Are there more articles  Coming out, eh?  I don't know  What the hell  You know  People want to know  If there will be more articles  Coming out  I would say probably not  Probably not  I don't think it's all that thrilling  Yeah  Wow  Whatever  All right  So which one are you going to read first?

The Daily News  From the five pages of the Daily News  This  The Daily News had a nice picture of me  Walking out of the courtroom  Or the courthouse in Manhattan  And as I said before  If you want to get a little image  Of what the courthouse looks like  If you've seen The Godfather  The movie  At the end  When Michael Corleone  Is taking care of business  During the baptism  Of his godchild  And the one  One ahead of the five families  Gets shot 
[01:29:00]  At the top of the big  Long courthouse steps  By the guy  That's dressed like a cop  That's the courtroom  Where the dead guy  Was falling down the stairs  That's where  We were walking down  And having that picture taken  That ended up in the Daily News  With the paparazzi  In front of you  Yeah  We walk out  The pops are going off  They're taking pictures  And I'm looking behind me  For who they're taking pictures of  That's how big  A tool  I am  I have no clue  That for some reason  They're taking pictures  Of me  Well this is a big story

[01:40:30]  Releasing any of the details  Of said settlement  Is that  I felt  It was going to  Go on  Longer than I would have liked  It had already taken up  A lot of my life  And time  And I thought it was a  A good time to  Get out  And  You know  It was kind of  A mutual  Outlook on the whole thing too  Because I think  Other people involved  Were like  Hey  You know  It's kind of  You know 
[01:41:00]  It's been going on  Long enough  Alright  So we went into  The room  Yes  And details of that  Are as it says here  Hopi  Confidential  Confidential  Confidential  Do I see that  Oh yeah  Okay  So let me back up  It was more complicated  Okay  Shortly after the grilling  Anthony Jennifer  And their lawyers  Went behind closed doors  And emerged two hours later  Announcing they had group sex  No  That is not in the paper  What did you read

[01:42:30]  She went skipping out of here  That's exactly what he said  That's the quote  In the paper  Anthony had no comment  We walked out  Together  At the same time  There was no skipping  There was no skipping  I would have seen skipping  Alright  Last year  Greg Opie Hughes  And Anthony Cumia  Reportedly signed  A $30  Three year syndication deal  $30  Spread over three years 
[01:43:00]  My friend  Right  And while Cumia  Denied knowing  How much he was worth  Barbara said  There was a report  Putting the value  Of his celebrity status  At $100 million  $100 million  And I just learned  I'm worth $130 million  You're worth $130  Why's that  I don't know  You're a little  I think  Because you have been  In this business  Because my name's first  And your expertise  In the business  But we're equal partners  In this  Alright  Jennifer Cumia  Cumia filed for divorce  In 1999

[01:45:30]  And I'm thinking  Hmm  Is it March or May  Well  Why don't you tell the listeners  Why you were confused  Well  March 19th  Is Swallows Day  In San Juan Capistrano  Which was very  It's where the swallows  Come back to Capistrano  Right  You know that  Every year they come back  And being a former resident  Of San Juan Capistrano  Growing up  It was always a  Pretty big date  Because there'd be a big parade  And a town  They'd get together  Are we talking about birds 
[01:46:00]  And we ride  What  We're talking about birds  Yeah  Okay  Oh Jesus  What  I don't know  Yes  They would come back  To Capistrano  So  The March May thing  I may  Have  Delayed my answer  For a moment or two  Until  You know  It's like  Well it was May 19th  And then it looks like  I didn't remember  It was right on the tip of my tongue  I was just ready  To blurt it out  That's how the daily news article ends 
[01:46:30]  I'm going to get into the post here  In a second  Ike what's going on  Yeah hi  Ant I think you finally just got even  With Opie for the time article  You mean the one where my only quote  Is about how  The Ashley  Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are hot  Yeah  That should have been in the threesome  The two Olsen twins  Yeah two other girls in Anthony's life  The Olsen twins  All right Ike  Thank you 
[01:47:00]  All right so let's read the post  Very very funny  The post for some reason  Used an old picture of  Here in the studio  Yes  And underneath the picture  Opie what does it say  Tales of three way sex  Tales of three way sex  Very very funny  Tony what's going on 
[01:47:30]  Hey you know I'm not a big legal buff  I'm pretty sure if the ex-girlfriend's lawyer calls up and calls you a gentleman  That's never a good sign  I think we don't really need to know how confidential it was  All right  Bye guys  Bye  It is a gentleman though  It's a nice guy  Well I try  Thank you Opie  I try  All right well  I try to go through life as a nice guy 
[01:48:00]  A nice boy  See  Is your mom proud  I turned my phones off on  Do they have any idea  On Thursday  Now  I was in court on Tuesday  Yeah  The story came out in the papers on Wednesday  Yeah  My phone was off until I believe Friday  Now I called up my mom  She's cool  You're a very liberated woman  You know what the hell is she going to say  She goes well you know you're an adult  Did she give you permission to play that bit 
[01:48:30]  No she's not that liberated  That's a good trade off though  What kind of trade off is that  Give her 10 mil  You're feeling a little uncomfortable  So maybe your mom can feel a little uncomfortable  Let us play that bit again  I don't feel uncomfortable  I think it's like  It's a little uncomfortable  It's expected of us on this goddamn show  Hell you're a hero  But I feel a little uncomfortable  Well you know something  The only uncomfortable thing I got was  Because I know  The neighborhood my mom lives in 
[01:49:00]  You know they probably looking like  Oh boy  Oh boy  There's the mother of that  You know  That pervert  That sexual  Shut up  What  Yeah that one's better  For everybody  Every boy  Dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan dan  Ann Marie agrees with something you said  Ann Marie 
[01:49:30]  Yes  Hey what's up  Nothing  I just wanted to call  Anthony though that  I sympathize with your situation  And I want to let you know  That I agree with you  It's not a group sex  Until you've had  Foursome  Right  Exactly.  It's a menage a trois with three, which I have experienced.  It's very fun.  And then I invited two other women into my husband and myself's bedroom,  and I would consider that group sex.  Three menage a trois, four group sex.  Absolutely.  I totally agree.  I've had both, and I would have to go with you with the group. 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Four or more is group.  Thank you, Anne-Marie.  Hey, have a great night.  All right, bye.  But it's like I was saying earlier, how do you come into work if there was, like, guys involved?  Ugh!  Ugh!  Fuggets.  That's right, Frenchie.  Touche.  All right.  Can we go to the FU line?  We do have to take a break here.  We gave you guys 40 minutes.  Don't yell anymore, please.  Stop yelling.  Did you read the second one we'll read when we get back?  That's where I have sheepish replies. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, the word sheepish.  You know, I don't like the way they describe my responses.  In one, I'm snapping.  In one, I'm sheepish in my answer.  Where was snapping?  I'm snapping above sheepish.  Sheepish snapping.  Yeah, there you go.  Snapped.  You snapped, of course.  I snapped.  I didn't snap.  All right.  We'll go to the FU line and we'll continue in just a bit.  Thanks for calling and here's the Opie and Anthony FU line.  Hey, this is Derek from Massachusetts.  I'd like to send a big floppy FU to all the dumb ass traffic on the Mass Pike every day I come home. 
[01:51:00]  It's the goddamn sun.  Why do you have to f***ing break at the f***ing sun?  The sun isn't coming at you.  Stop f***ing stopping for no f***ing reason.  Use the f***ing gas pedal.  Stop stomping.  Just stop.  Stop.  Next message.  This is a big f***ing cue to the guy who hit and killed my dog and never stopped. 
[01:51:30]  I hope while you were running away like a little coward, you ran a red light and a truck slammed into you, knocking you into a ditch and leaving you there to die.  What an a**hole.  F*** you.  Next message.  Yeah, I'm a personal trainer.  I want to say FU to all my fat clients who are hell-bent on wasting my time and then eating goddamn Nalamars before I walk in on them in their house.  FU, you fat, spoiled brat. 
[01:52:00]  Next message.  Yeah, this is FU to Con Quinn for never hunting down Julie Brown.  Probably worked for MPB and punching her in her stupid fat face.  Wubba wubba.  End of message.  How old are you?  18.  All right, put your shirt on.  Wow.  Fabulous.  Well.  Hoby Ravioli.  Hoby and Anthony.  Nice to meet you.  Nice to know me. 
[01:52:30]  That's the message.  Where do you show me?  How am I waiting?  How am I waiting?  How am I waiting for my Sunday, girl?  Yeah, I've been waiting for my Sunday, girl. 
[01:53:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  What a day, what a day, what a day.  Oh, yeah.  Big story.  After two and a half years, Anthony is a free man.  He's divorced.  Right.  Happened over vacation.  Yeah.  Kind of the reason why we went on vacation, if you think about it.  Well, actually, I would have rather spent vacation somewhere else. 
[01:53:30]  True, but.  And then it was court dates.  It was over like day one.  Day one, couple hours into it, instead of a week or so?  Yeah, two weeks.  It's going to be a two-week trial.  All with everybody.  It was going to be fun.  A regular old party.  It's going to be happening over there on Center Street.  All right, so we are finally to the second article, the New York Post article from March 20th, 2002, Anthony.  Right off the AP. 
[01:54:00]  AP.  The headline reads, Radio Raunch Man in R-Rated Divorce.  R-Rated.  That would be you, my friend.  I couldn't even get like X-Rated Divorce, you know?  Like, why is it Radio Raunch Man in R-Rated Divorce?  Like, the headline is like, ooh, X-Rated.  Oh, I got to read it.  I have a feeling if you went five more minutes on the witness stand, it was going out.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  It's hoping for triple X.  Jesus.  All right, so I'm going to read this in, and when you want to comment, you hit your little bell over there, okay? 
[01:54:30]  Uh-huh.  And if you want to comment, but you can't, that's when you ding, ding, ding, ding.  Right.  Ding, ding, ding.  Exactly.  Do a little rush thing for us there.  Okay.  Uh, and you thought his radio show was raunchy.  Ho, ho.  You thought.  Uh, Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame is free to go effing crazy.  What?  Wait a minute.  What?  That isn't in the article I have. 
[01:55:00]  No, this is the updated version.  No, again, it's magic marker that is in Rick's handwriting.  No, this is, no, look.  Look, I'm holding it up.  Look, there's the picture of you from a long time ago.  It says nothing about free to go effing crazy.  Can I read this?  Well, read the real article.  And you're supposed to hit the bell when, uh, you want to comment.  Thank you.  Read the real article.  All right.  Uh, Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame is free to go effing crazy.  He settled his divorce case, but not before talking about all the effing he was doing on the witness stand. 
[01:55:30]  It doesn't say that.  Uh, did you bring other women into your bed?  Jennifer's lawyer, Fat Dominic, asked the surprise schlong jock.  It said shock jock, and half of that what you said doesn't read the goddamn article.  And your answer, uh, yeah, so what's your point, you eff, shh, ooh.  What?  All right, I got to use a couple, uh, a couple letters.  I'm surprised they're, uh, they can print this in the post, but we can't read it, uh, word for word on the air. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, so what's your point, you fat ass?  I didn't say that.  It's not in the favor of it.  The WNW personality snapped.  Snapped.  That is, uh, not the way the article went.  Wasn't there another woman you were seeing?  The snake-like lawyer asked.  That is... 
[01:56:30]  What?  That isn't what's...  You are reading something Rick wrote.  Yeah, of course.  Your reply, Anthony?  Yeah, why are you jealous?  I can get laid, fat boy.  That is what was in the paper.  Replied, kumia, sheepishly.  Sheepishly.  Sheepishly.  My sheepish response.  Would you...  Was she one of the, uh, thirdsome in bed?  The sweaty lawman asked. 
[01:57:00]  Sweaty lawman?  I don't see that.  You replied, uh, with this, Anthony?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I lost count, you mother-effing fat-ass eater.  I don't think that's the article.  It's not the one I have right here.  Everything you've said has not been in the paper. 
[01:57:30]  Some type of farcical article that you have that was written by, uh, Rick.  Rick, very funny, Rick.  All right.  I'll try this one.  Okay.  Oh, Lady Di checking in.  Hey, ONA, welcome back to the studio.  How was vacation, Anthony?  Other than the court date, how was the rest of your vacation? 
[01:58:00]  How does it feel to be free?  I know that I love it.  I would call, but I have a cold.  We'll see you soon, Lady Di.  Oh, Uncle John wants to say something.  Uncle John?  Uncle John.  Hello?  Uh, hi.  Hey.  I have an invitation of Anthony, uh, free to go crazy now.  Why?  Bang, bang, bang.  I'm going crazy.  Bang, bang, bang.  I'm crazy.  Bang, bang.  That's the Friday crazy bang, bang. 
[01:58:30]  Uh, Gooch.  Gooch.  What's up, Gooch?  How you doing?  All right.  Just was curious if, uh, Anthony, by any chance, knew when, uh, Columbus discovered America.  I think that was 14, May.  Hmm.  I don't remember.  March 19th?  March.  Is it March?  May.  May.  No?  What?  I don't remember.  All right.  Let's get through this here.  All right.  So, Radio Raunch Man and R-Rated Divorce, uh, and he thought his radio show was raunchy. 
[01:59:00]  Ho-ho.  Anthony Cumia of Opie and Anthony fame settled his divorce case against estranged, uh, wife  Jennifer yesterday, but not before talking about riding the three-way of love on the witness  stand.  What is that?  Now, my friend, that is tight.  It's off the AP.  No magic marker.  The three-way of love on the witness stand.  It almost makes it sound like it happened on the witness stand.  But not before talking about riding the three-way of love.  Yeah.  Boom-ticka-bom. 
[01:59:30]  Boom-ticka-bom.  Boom-ticka-bom.  Boom-ticka-bom.  The caravan of love.  Three-way of love.  Oh, jeez.  Freaking reporters.  Did you bring other women into the, into your bed with your wife?  Jennifer's lawyer.  Dominic Barber asked the surprise shock jock.  No, I didn't.  Yes, I snapped.  Says the WNW personality snapped.  Were you lying on the witness stand at that point?  Hey, I, first of all, look.  See everything in this article?  No, Rick, that's fine.  Look.  See everything, every quote in this article?  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  I stand by everything that I said in here.  Okay.  So I, yes, I stand by that.  All right.  That answer.  Very good.  Put two and two together.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's four.  Two and two, Frenchie.  It's making a joke.  And four equals?  Group sex.  We learned that today.  There was no, no, there was no four.  Sex.  Stop it.  All right. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  Wasn't there another woman you were seeing during the marriage, Barbara asked or followed?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Kumia replied sheepishly.  Yeah.  Was she one of the thirdsome bed?  What?  Was she one of the thirdsome bed?  Oh, I get it.  Okay.  Barbara asked.  Yes.  Answered.  Kumia the first.  And as it turned out, only witness to be called to the stand before state Supreme Court Justice 
[02:01:00]  Joan Blah Blah.  After testifying for about three hours, the Whip Em Out Wednesday's co-creator.  Is that my, is that my moniker?  I'm the Whip Em Out Wednesday co-creator.  Co-creator.  Whip Em Out Wednesday coming back strong.  Oh, yeah.  Within a week, co-creator abruptly settled the case after discovering reporters were sitting  in the courtroom.  Don't make yourself sound so important, Diarrhea Gregorian, whatever the hell your name is. 
[02:01:30]  Believe me, the fact that you two were sitting there had no bearing on whether this would  be settled or not.  Gary.  Three reasons why I hate Anthony.  Yeah.  Ten million dollars a year.  All the poontang you can possibly look at and touch in your studio every day.  Yeah.  And then you've got to have three of them in bed, you bastard.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm sorry for that one, Andy.  Thank you, Opie. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  Oops.  All right.  So you're the co-creator.  Abruptly settled the case after discovering reporters were sitting in the courtroom.  The terms of the deal are confidential.  Confidential.  Again, confidential.  Will you be able to pay for coffee still?  I think I could scrape up the change that falls behind the couch or something.  All right.  Uh, Kumi is, uh, just reading this, Anthony. 
[02:02:30]  I'm sorry.  Uh-huh.  Kumi is testimony began, uh, with his recounting his rise to fame and bantering back.  Kumi has said he was working for an air conditioning company in the late 80s, but that is talents for...  When Barbara, the fat F, asked him what characters he'd mimic... 
[02:03:00]  Now, see, you're editorializing again, Opie.  It doesn't say...  He replied...  Excuse me?  I believe I can imitate you, you goddamn fat, money-grubbing, publicity...  No!  ...whorebag.  See, it says, I believe I used to do Dominic Barber.  You want to hear it?  I just can't seem to sweat while I breathe.  No!  Oh, see, that isn't in the article either.  Oh, it's over here.  I'm sorry. 
[02:03:30]  Take that off the record.  Uh, when Barbara asked, uh, what characters he'd mimic, he replied, I believe I used to do Dominic Barber.  Yeah, I know.  I got it here, Rick.  Thank you.  Later, the ample and rotund attorney...  It just says ample in mind.  But I do believe that is funny enough that they did put, you know, I'm, uh, what am I?  The co-creator, raunchy, sheepish, the co-creator of Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[02:04:00]  He gets ample.  The ample attorney.  Later, the ample and rotund attorney accused Kumia of talking about Jennifer on there and said,  you discussed not only your wife, but your wife's lawyer, correct?  Barbara added, you made some fat jokes about him.  And you said, yeah, you're fat.  You effing loser.  I didn't say that.  It says here, Kumia laughed. 
[02:04:30]  But the judge said he didn't have to answer.  But I've been with you a while, and I could read into, you know...  Me laughing?  Yeah, it says, Kumia laughing.  I know what you're laughing about.  Kumia laughed, but the judge said he didn't have to answer.  Right.  The syndicated yapper...  The syndicated yapper...  Yapper.  Said he first met Jennifer back in 1987, but they didn't start dating until 1989.  They married seven months later, but Kumia couldn't remember when. 
[02:05:00]  Again.  Again.  With the goddamn date that I couldn't remember.  What's up with that?  And there you have it, I believe.  There you go.  All you need to know.  It's right there in black and white.  And that's what you did on your winter vacation.  That's my vacation.  Oh, you dick. 
[02:05:30]  The Russell Crowe of radio.  Get out of here.  Terry and Janine, what's going on today?  Hi, yeah, we'd like to do the 6 o'clock quiz.  Ah.  Yes.  And on our van, will both of you be doing it at the same time?  No, I can't do it.  My friend can do it.  Two girls for every boy.  She was the greatest priest of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world. 
[02:06:00]  All right, so your friend could do it.  Yeah, I can do it.  My friend could do it.  Do you want to talk to her?  Yeah, let's talk to her.  Okay, hold on.  Here.  Okay.  Hello?  Hello?

[02:10:00]  honestly uh i didn't know rick at all i knew rick was sandy's brother that's all i knew of rick  now this isn't saying anything about your life now great guy you're leading a very good life oh my god  you're prefacing i was under the he's about to say something yeah no i was he's about to say that now  i'm a loser compared to what he thought i was before no no but i will say i was under the impression  that you were some hollywood mover and shaker we i swear to you rick opie think about it first of 
[02:10:30]  all i'm hammered we land rick picks us up yeah with the latest sunglasses the latest hair cut the  latest clothes he lives out in where do you live studio city no that's where i used to live i was  only vacationing that week whatever i was here's what i thought you but you went to an apartment well  yeah that was my old apartment yeah like yeah it was in what studio city right yep so he picks us up  in this mustang convertible he's out in hollywood i'm like who is this what the hell is this guy doing 
[02:11:00]  it's like mr actor or something i i hear that he's appeared in things he's driving around in a nice car  it was a rental car wasn't it yeah oh yeah it was on vacation like here's my apartment in studio city  like jesus christ and then i find out he's rick after a while time goes on it's like oh what  happened to the guy it was just rick good old rick this is good old rick this was beaver cleaver's 
[02:11:30]  house uh and leave it to beaver but as we drive around you'll see it's just two by fours holding up  what we call a facade or false front no more facade that's what we call a rented mustang  there's a house used in quantum dice  and uh yeah and but then you know like i said it's nothing to do with the way your way your life  is now i just assume that you were uh you know hollywood mover and shaker and then apparently he  was he appeared in an episode of a couple episodes right or one episode of beverly hills 
[02:12:00]  episodes of melrose 902101 melrose he's got to explain the extra thing he was doing the extra thing  he was doing the extra i was doing the jeff norris thing jeff likes to say that he's you know  whatever he's an extra here we go he's an extra what cereal did you play he's a mini wheat that's  well that's true were you no that's like a paid thing for him yes usually what he talks about is  you know the the mysterious gun that jumped when he was playing a cop in a show it was extra work  extra work that's all it is so you do extra work right and uh one of the shows that you did extra 
[02:12:30]  work in was a beverly hills 90210 very popular at the time at the time sure well  year about about 93 94 93 94 are you gonna give steve the tape so he can i already gave it to him  oh my god foundry yeah and then you know jeff could work his magic as far as maybe slowing it down  freezing it putting an arrow yeah where rick is in the scene because if you blink you'll miss you'll  so you can play it a million times and see ah steve say you know how is it uh how's rick is rick is 
[02:13:00]  barely in this scene anthony that he's actually out of focus because he's so far away from the  pivotal though actually there's about a split one tenth of a second that i am in focus then i'm back  oh yeah yeah when you're over the guy's shoulder right right yeah good shot good shot thanks i think  i'll have to do is slow it down drastically and put a big yellow fag fag fag fag fag across the bottom  well now that brings us to what the scene was yeah where's the audio yeah right over there oh we 
[02:13:30]  have some of that audio to let everybody know what the scene was perhaps you remember this episode if  you were a 90210 fan the one with the starring rick let's just play the audio and uh pretty much  tell the people that rick is in the in the background he's in the background he's one of the patrons  of this establishment reading in the background looking might i say like he completely fits into  this place yes well you really you must have had to have that's what my part called exactly bravo  that's what actors do and you went all out if they asked me to be a cop i'd call norris for a gun

[02:20:00]  what were you  what did they tell you now  all right  they you you obviously the director or somebody had to tell you where to stand  and what to do  they position you in certain places and they just say  pretend you're reading this magazine which i was doing  so you're just you were kind of leaning very gay-like against the pole  yes you were  and who played the pole  how do you lean gay-like  well  anthony explain  please explain to me how would one lean gay-like  all right i could explain because i know you well enough to know 
[02:20:30]  that if you were acting in a scene  where you're in a gay bar and you had to play a gay guy  you would try to gay it up a bit  just and if all you're doing is standing there  if all you're doing is standing there reading a magazine  you're going to try to do it as gay as possible  i just know that  and that's fine  you're playing a gay guy  how would one get gay on camera  even though it was a split second shot  i saw by the way you leaned and kicked your hip out  it said have gay sex with me  it was  you're reading the magazine  and the way you were standing 
[02:21:00]  was very feminine  i did not kick a gay hip out  you kicked a gay hip out  i did not  you kind of  you know how you kind of  push your hip out  if you're leaning against something  in a gay fashion  that's what kind of you were doing  but you were doing a good job of acting  that's all you were doing  i understand  just acting  acting  right  yes  you had to go through  wait what did the director say  i don't know what the director said  did he like your work  they basically just  it's it's just a big group of guys  yeah  and they as they 
[02:21:30]  as they go  i heard your line was cut out  coffee tea or me  and they just  depending on where they think you would fit  hey how about a cup of joe  where's joe  where is joe  alright go ahead  no i'm not going to tell you  no no no  because  what was going through your head  you're sitting there  and you know you're  you're playing a gay guy  you were playing a gay guy

[02:28:00]  with a  lamb next  to me  whip out  your cans  pull out  your fun  bag  what are you  waiting for  do it  do it  now  you look  fabulous  ob  and anthony  we love  seeing boobs  well duh  she was on  the news  huh  the submarine  thing 
[02:28:30]  that's  that's a  pretty wacky  story  it's getting  better and  better every  day too  well  like i said  new details  come out  every day  they just  trickle a few  things out  i'm sure the  military would  love to just  keep everything  quiet with  this thing  but they  can't  there were  civilians on  board the  sub and  they were  off of  hawaii  somewhere in  the pacific  and they  did one of  those power  surface maneuvers  they do  where they just 
[02:29:00]  blow the  ballast tanks  and the thing  comes up like  a fish  doing that  like a  dolphin  and uh  oops  jack trawler  was right above  him  you could say  jack rick  it was an  acceptable  term back  in the  40s  so it was  colored but  i guess we  can't use  jack  you can use  jack  jack trawler  i hate  political  in the water  it wasn't  chinese  it was  rick they  were japs  rick writes  chinese  look at  how politically  incorrect you  are i don't 
[02:29:30]  care they're  just jinx  they have  slanty eyes  they're slanty  eyes it's all  the same  that was a  jack trawler  and the sub  comes up and  what luck  the sub came up  right underneath  the boat  sunk it in like  nine minutes  now it just  sounded at first  like oh that's  tragic you know  the sub comes up  then it turns out  there were some  civilians on board  but they said  on board the sub  but they said  they weren't  near any of the  controls or anything  then it comes out 
[02:30:00]  that one guy  is at the  helmsman station  but they were  like soldiers  or the seaman  behind them  you said seaman  both posts  up by the helm  were taken  by civilians  then it turns out  it seems  every post  was manned  by a civilian  but there were  one of the guys  that was supposed  to be stationed  there right behind  him watching  the guy that  actually did  the ballast  blow maneuver  was a civilian  he pulled  the lever  so they said 
[02:30:30]  they checked  they looked  through the  periscope  they did  their sonar  check  the sonar  check an hour  before  showed the  boat  it was there  they knew  it was there  then the  sonar guy  left  they're saying  he was  distracted  by  a civilian  on board  whoops  yeah  oops  oops  here's my  theory  they're having  a little fun  they've got some  civilians on board  they want to show  does your  theory have  anything to do  with OJ  killing anyone  yes  OJ  was working 
[02:31:00]  the captain's  head  because he had  cut it off  like a puppet  of course  reverting back  to the  surface the ship  who cares  about the  slanty eyed  bastards  it's OJ  and Joel  reverting back  to the beginning  of the show  okay  go ahead  so I'm thinking  some civilians  on board  you want to show  off a little bit  commanding a sub  you got all the  guys in there  wouldn't it sound  close like  hey watch this  we are going to  pop up  in front of  this trawler  and scare  the bejesus  out of these  Japs  just watch  for a goof  imagine that 
[02:31:30]  you're sitting  in a trolley  you're like  very good  we learn  fish  we learn  put net  in water  bring up  fripper  and a few  sears  and other  things that  Americans find  cute and don't  want cured  bring up  in net  so for a chuckle  why not  imagine that  though  you're just  out in the  water  and for a goof  and you would  S your pants  on the spot  oh my god  you're just  sitting there  all of a sudden  this huge  submarine  comes flying  out of the  water  in front of  Godzilla  oh no 
[02:32:00]  Godzilla  oh no  run  all right 
[02:32:30]  sorry  continue  you know  just scare  the hell  out of him  be a goof  yeah  but since  the sonar  guy wasn't  right there  I guess  they figured  well it's  got to be  close by  it can't  be right  over us  oops  wrongo  right over  him  and  took a big  chunk out of  it and it  sunk in like  nine minutes  a bunch of  people  died  a lot of  people lived  though  there were  some  survivors  water is so 
[02:33:00]  cold  I'm here  hold on  I'm here  hold on  to you  Chang  hold on  Chang  little  tiny  wrist  what's  that  I hear  as  the  icy  water  put me  in a  daze  is that  serene  Dion  that huge  camera toe  in the side  of our boat  when we 
[02:33:30]  get to  America  you  will  be in the  Yankee  Cranky  shop  or in  their  surrounds  or work  at sushi  restaurants  what the  hair was  that  was so  nice  when you  draw me  on the  ship  you like a  naked drawing  I do  of you  you like a

[02:34:30]  nine minutes  wrong  and we  sunk  crap  not even  time to  send up  a frat  not even  time to  whip up  a fried  right  Yoshi  on  Yoshi  go both  ways  Chinese  and  Japanese  oh we  all went  in the  water  boat  went  down  nine  minutes  that's  when  sharks  come  cruising  I guess  about  seven o'clock  first ones 
[02:35:00]  came  they start  there  pounding  and pounding  you hear  high-pitched  screaming  and  horroring  horroring  but they  just keep  pounding  and pounding  rifle's eyes  like a  geisha girl's  eyes  so I  need a 
[02:35:30]  rocking  chair  once  I  will not  stand  by  until  performed  some kind  of  autopsy  on the  beach  I  won't  stand  here  while you  cut that  thing  open  and watch  that little  chung  chung  chung  boy  fall out  door  over  dark  a rice  bird  dead  ahead  what a  tragedy  what a tragedy  uh-oh

[02:37:30]  I crapped myself  Very dishonored  Let's go to the phone side  Glenn, what's going on?  Hey  Every time we had civilians on board  We used to go crazy showing off  Wait, you were on one of those subs?  Yeah, I did eight years on a ballistic missile sub  So you would show off on the civilian  Watch, just toss one out of the top  This one's great  So you would show off for the civilians  What would you do?  Well, we used to do what they called angles and dangles  We used to go down really fast 
[02:38:00]  And go deep and then pull it back up  And one time we had such an upward angle  That we lost all our navigations  Everything went offline  Because we had too steep of an angle  Ah, who cares?  Right?  It's like, ah, what a ride  Who cares? We need navigation  It's the sea, there's nothing out here  Watch the civilians wrap themselves  That used to be crazy  Oh, that's funny  You horarius  Very funny  Hey, Chris, what's going on?  Crack a boat open right fortune cookie  What up? 
[02:38:30]  Hey, man, I was in here for four years  And when you come back from Hawaii  It's like San Francisco  It's called a Tiger Cruise  And you can bring like three of your family members  To ride on board  And you got little kids driving the ship  You got the old chariatrics  Oh, my God, it's crazy  This is great  What does this do?  Oh, no!  How old is Conway's going to wait  Before we start selling pieces of the trawler  On the home shopping?  Yeah  All right, buddy  Let's go to Chuck  Chuck, what's going on?  Hey, I was in the military for four years 
[02:39:00]  They let my father drive an aircraft carrier  He's a phone man  Oh, come on, man  Come on, is that true, though, Brian?  Yeah, man  They, like the guy said, man  They take you from Hawaii to San Diego  Where I was stationed  And on the way back  They do a bunch of tours  That's right  They took him up to the bridge  The guy watched him  And there he is  He's got pictures and everything  Of him steering a thousand foot  Billion dollar aircraft  Look, I'm driving  What's that?  All right, guys, you rule  All right 
[02:39:30]  Later  Tragedy  At sea  Who's driving boat?  Who's driving submarine?  It's Eric Hartman  Rudy, what's going on?  1982  I was running a 148-foot supercruiser  Off Montauk Point 
[02:40:00]  About a hundred people on board  We had a submarine come up  Right in front of us  That's great  And I know I shit myself  Oh, hey, oh, hey  Hold on, hold on  So a submarine came up  In front of your boat  And you crapped yourself  Yeah  That's got to be intense looking  We're doing about  26, 28 knots  On a 148-footer  I do believe we have audio  From that day  It's coming right for us  No  How close was it?  Uh, came up about 
[02:40:30]  Within a hundred yards  Had my feet up  You got to think  They do that crap on purpose  Because they're bored out there  That's not  They're supposed to put up  A warning before they come up  All right, thank you  All right  All right  Japsub  Slam two torpedoes  Into our side  Payback a bitch  If I knew that would happen  I'd go to Reeve  I'd turn around  Chief, what's going on?  You guys make me rock so hard  I'm going to drop  Crouching tiger in my kimono  Let's go to Marianne 
[02:41:00]  Marianne, what's going on?  Hey guys, how are you?  Good  I just called because  I knew I kept my mouth shut  Long enough about  Wanting to hear some Yoshi bits  That he'd eventually  Turn up somewhere  And there he was  On the submarine  On the fishing ship  Who knew?  Yeah, Yoshi on the Titanic  I was just  Derivering some time  My little bicycle  On the deck of boat  I was going to  Pedder back to Manhattan  Oh, that's my guy  I love you, Jack 
[02:41:30]  Yes, I know you love me  There's plenty of room  On that door  You're floating on  I never understand  Why you won't  Red me on  And then when we all die  We end up back  On Japanese trara  All young again  Waiting for another submarine  Very good 
[02:42:00]  Very touching tribute  To those people  God damn  Oh, the sugar  Stades out to the waist  Oh, they were hit  With a boatload of semen  Well, they was  They're all as skinny 
[02:42:30]  As olives  Look at the chinks  Well, they is  Rob, what's up?  Hey, guys  How's it going?  Good, man  Anyhow, I was in Coronado  I was coming back  On a tiger cruise  On a destroyer  About 400 guys or so  We let somebody  The captain's father  Actually drive the ship  So we're coming through  Underneath the Coronado bridge  And this other boat  Was coming right for us  Coming right for us  He's coming right for us  So anyhow  We're coming right through it  And the cop goes  You know, we're telling the cop  He's getting a little close  And he's like  No, he'll move 
[02:43:00]  This guy's coming right for us  And sure enough  They hit us  The whole thing  Goes all the way down  So now we stop the ship  Now we stop the ship  And then we stop  Everything comes in  The border  Everybody comes over  Trying to get this guy out  But it is a true fact  They do let people  Drive the ships  On a tiger cruise  That's just amazing  Yeah  I guess it happens every time  But when they come up  And nail a Japanese trawler  It's pretty bad  All they would have had to do  Is feed some spinach  To the ship  Right in the engine  Would have kicked the sub's ass 
[02:43:30]  Wait a minute  Hey Stinkski  Load up my bowl  Wayne, what's up?  Hey man, listen  I was in the Navy  And they're in Nam  And I remember  Being at sea  In the North Atlantic  And firing salvo rounds  Over top of a rushing  Fishing ship  Just for the hell of it  Because, you know  They were out there  And we were firing rounds  Over top of them  They were on the radio  Talking back to us  In Russia  We had no idea
