<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton discussing their exhaustion. Anthony blamed a late dose of Dayquil for his grogginess.  Norton recounted attending the "Arthur" remake premiere, detailing encounters with Russell Brand and a less-than-thrilled Brian Dennehy.  A lengthy comparison of the remake to the original ensued, covering plot points, casting (Liza Minnelli vs. Jennifer Garner), editing, and comedic effectiveness.  The conversation shifted to the rise of comedian podcasts, contrasting them with the challenges of morning radio.  Jim Norton's persistent cough fueled speculation about potential illnesses, interspersed with discussions about favorite Rolling Stones songs and humorous disagreements. Ronnie B joined the show in studio, offering support and perspective on morning radio.

The show continued with Ronnie B from "Ron and Fez" as a guest.  Discussions covered naps, the challenges of co-sleeping with an infant, and darkly humorous reflections on parenthood and mortality.  The conversation veered to the Rolling Stones' treatment of opening acts (including Metallica), followed by a humorous anecdote about a near-miss with Mick Jagger backstage.  Stories about meeting famous people, including Bill Clinton and a highly profane and detailed account of a near-disaster with President George H.W. Bush and the Secret Service, were shared. This involved a stage direction mix-up, intense Secret Service glares, and impressions of the President's imposing presence. Presidential motorcades and security were discussed.  The conversation then shifted to Sinbad, his stand-up, and career influence on other black comedians.  Ronnie shared experiences working with Bill Hicks, leading to a comparison of stand-up and radio, touring challenges, and differing comedic styles.  The segment concluded with discussions about Charlie Sheen's post-rehab performances and a humorous anecdote involving Meat Loaf. Ronnie's interviewing style and experiences (including interviewing Jack Kevorkian) were also discussed.

The next segment began with reminiscing about comedian Voss, described as a "scary drug head" who introduced them to crack cocaine.  The conversation transitioned to Voss's current career and comedic style.  A humorous Radio Shack customer service call skit followed, with Ronnie B's surprise appearance attributed to personal circumstances.  Discussions covered their various radio shows and podcasts and collaborative work.  A playful bit recreating childhood machine gun sounds led to discussions about their childhoods, including one host's upbringing in a nudist colony and another's in an elderly neighborhood.  Childhood bullying and parenting styles were also discussed, along with anecdotes about their mothers and strict rules.  Detailed discussions of bizarre childhood games like "undie flip" and "peenie flip" were included.  Sinbad then joined the show, and the conversation turned to basketball, his playing days, opinions on legendary players, and a comparison of the game's past and present. Sinbad briefly discussed his early career, including a rumored Star Search victory over Dennis Miller, and his experiences in the 1980s comedy scene, promoting his new show, "It's Just Family".

Sinbad's guest appearance continued with him recounting his early career, getting a gig at Giggles (owned by Johnny Calkers) after missing open mic night, and his comedic evolution from dirty to cleaner material. He discussed the challenges of typecasting in Hollywood and details of his new reality show, *Sinbad is Just Family*. The conversation shifted to Ronnie's upcoming radio appearances and suggestions for Fez's facial hair.  Sinbad's career, Bill Cosby's comedic genius despite controversy, and Ronnie's interviewing style were discussed.  A photo of Anthony with a large casino win was shown, leading to discussions about Anthony's cruise (including encounters with dolphins and monkeys), Steve C's condo fire, and a paraplegic grandfather attacking his granddaughter's alleged molester.  The segment concluded with discussions about personal experiences with death and birth, the strangeness of life and death, and the parent-child bond. Anecdotes about childhoods and parenting experiences were shared.

The show concluded with a wrap-up discussing the show's scheduling and listener habits, featuring a worsening illness of one host, humorous exaggerations of his condition, and exchanges about owed favors.  Discussions covered optimal show times and listener engagement with live versus replay broadcasts.  A short audio clip of Don Wicklund singing with "The Straits" sparked discussion about his musical talent.  Further topics included upcoming guest appearances, Ronnie's knowledge of serial killers and fan mail, an upcoming comedy tour, a planned "Broadcaster's Corner" segment, internal dynamics of the show's staff (specifically sound engineer Dave), and a highly valued "Freebird" story. No guests were in-studio besides the regular hosts and sound engineer.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Starts with the good morning.  Yes.  I walked out of my building this morning and there's Jimmy in the back seat.  Slumped over.  Yes.  You didn't sleep last night, huh?  No, I didn't.  I'm tired.  You're tuckered out?  I really am. 
[00:01:30]  Pooped.  Why do you sound way better than me?  I think I have a tired voice, which is very sultry.  Is that what it is?  Sultry.  You got like a scratchy voice?  Yeah.  I took the wrong cold stuff last night.  Yeah?  And I should have taken the night time before I went out, but I took the day time.  You took the day time at what time?  Maybe seven or eight, but that kept me up.  Maybe seven.  Dayquil?  Yeah.  No. 
[00:02:00]  Theraflu?  Yeah.  Day time, whatever?  Kept me up.  Yeah.  Because I felt like love by the time I'm home.  But then I just laid in bed and couldn't sleep.  It was fucking horrible.  You sound like you're on heroin or something.  I feel that way.  You sound like you're like a jazz guy.  I feel that very much.  Like a jazz guy.  I feel very much like that.  You feel very much like that?  I do.  How are we supposed to do a show?  It's going to be a rough one.  It's going to be rough.  Great.  It'll be enjoyable, though.  It will be enjoyable in one way. 
[00:02:30]  Well, we're just hanging.  You know, we could do that for four hours easily, man.  Well, fuck.  Give me some fucking Dayquil, man.  That's what it feels like.  So I could join this party.  No, you would need Nightquil now.  You would need a nighttime one to knock you out the way I am like right now.  So, all right.  I'll do some Nightquil and let's see what happens.  I want to go to bed.  I'll get home right after the show.  I'll just crash for a few hours.  I'll be fine.  Yeah.  But the cold is still kicking my ass.  Yeah, I feel a little worse today.  Do you?  As much as yesterday, I was bragging that I'm feeling good. 
[00:03:00]  You really were fucking Arnie immune system yesterday.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Well, today I woke up really achy.  Yeah, you might have it, man.  I woke up like a PMSing chick.  Just all achy.  Take coldies.  Coldies?  Let's get some coldies going.  It's obviously done nothing for me, but I mean...  And I'm sweating my balls off, so I don't know if it's hot in here or this is the fever  coming on.  I don't know.  I was hot.  We are trying to keep this show going.  But the fucking wheels are starting to fall off.  The whole thing is coming apart. 
[00:03:30]  It is.  I don't mind doing a show like this.  I don't mind being tired.  I mean, to the listeners, I apologize.  It's probably hard to listen to, but I'm just...  Well, it's not hard to listen to yet.  We haven't fucked it up yet.  We will.  So far, we're good.  So you took the day call at 7 or 8?  It was like 7, yeah.  And then you went to the Arthur premiere.  I went to the premiere of Arthur last night because I was able to score a ticket.  To the big premiere?  To the big premiere.  This wasn't one of those screenings, right?  No, no.  This was a real red carpet. 
[00:04:00]  This was the thing.  Red carpet.  Ziegfeld?  Yeah, the Ziegfeld, yeah.  They went to the Zieg?  Yes.  I could not...  Did you get any bedbugs?  I did not.  Why?  Were they there?  I don't know.  Why were they there?  What do you mean?  Were there reports of bedbugs there?  I think...  I don't know because now I could get sued for that.  A lot of movie theaters got the bedbugs.  They did.  It's true.  I'm not sure if Ziegfeld was on that list, but you would have to assume they have to  have at least one in there somewhere.  I got there right as Russell Brand was on the red carpet, so I didn't do any red carpet. 
[00:04:30]  Not that they would have wanted me to, but I might have been able to sneak on.  Right.  There weren't that many celebrities there, so I might have been able to because it was  a couple.  It was the cast, of course, but...  And Brian Dennehy.  Brian Dennehy's a legend.  Who I like, yeah.  He's a fucking legend.  He wanted nothing to do with me.  I bugged him for a photo after the movie.  I was like a handheld one and he fucking scowled at me.  Why is he scowling, you think?  I just wanted to get out of there and...  He probably only has a few years left of people asking for his photographs. 
[00:05:00]  I know, but I'm like, we're trying to show him on.  It was unprofessional.  Oh, really?  Well, that was the day call kicking in.  It really was.  Kept me from doing my job properly.  I see that.  But I had a good time.  The movie?  You know, it's a rough one to remake, but it had some good parts in it.  It's not my favorite comedy ever.  Is it in the top hundred?  Yeah.  Russell Brand was good, though.  Like, I mean, he's a good actor.  Arthur, he's fucking, he's good at delivering lines. 
[00:05:30]  He's good at delivering funny lines.  Some of the movie was kind of all over the place.  It was a little...  How do you remake Arthur and it's all over the place?  I think they just...  Just follow the fucking script.  They added a few elements to it that were...  That they decided needed to be in the movie?  A little to update it, yeah.  What did they take out from the original movie?  Do you remember?  The thing, it starts off with a car chase.  And, uh...  Car chase?  That's not Arthur.  Right.  But it starts off with Arthur and a car chase.  I'm not going to get too detailed, but... 
[00:06:00]  Don't worry about it.  The...  And then there's a thing with the police station.  But the original Arthur, if you remember, started with him on a, uh...  A date with a hooker.  And that was funny because he was talking to this hooker.  And you got to know him immediately.  Sure.  In this moment...  You knew what he was about.  You knew what he was about.  He was a drinker.  Are you a hooker?  I mean, that was just... 
[00:06:30]  Right, right.  I think they should have started with a scene that would have let you know him a little bit.  The relationships...  I liked Liza Minnelli in the original.  The girl Greta Gerwig in this one was prettier.  But I felt that she dressed too nice.  And it's little differences.  Like, I know I'm not doing a good job of describing, but I felt Liza was more believably awful.  Yeah, she was a shoplifter.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  And you felt that.  But her...  I almost said pizzazz.  Thank God, I stopped myself.  Was the Greta girl a shoplifter in this version?  No, she was an illegal tour guide.  She gave illegal tours.  They just wanted to update it.  But I think that Liza Minnelli's charm was so good.  Like, you understood why he liked her.  It was hard to understand why he would go for her over Jennifer Garner, who's fucking smoking hot.  And was kind of cunty in the movie, but she was supposed to be. 
[00:07:30]  Of course.  But you could see why Arthur would go for Liza Minnelli over Susan in the first one.  Because she was...  She brought him into a world he had never been in.  Sure.  You know what I mean?  This fucking...  You're poor, you know?  Right, right.  But she had so much charisma and balls.  This girl was more timid, I think.  It was just a different role.  And I think they made the Susan character too strong in this one.  A little too strong, which made it harder to not like her.  Because who doesn't want to fuck Jennifer Garner?  Yeah, of course.  You know what I mean?  She walks in lingerie in one scene. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Who wouldn't bang that?  You would deal with her cunty attitude, right?  Oh, please.  I've dealt with cunty for much less.  Much less.  Hey, is he a drinker in the film?  Because the...  He is a drinker.  He is.  He doesn't drink and drive in it.  Because he has a new guy who's playing Bitterman as a bigger part than he did in the first one too.  Right.  It's Louis Guzman.  Right.  Who's actually funny.  Yeah, we've had him on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  Cool guy.  He's a very nice guy.  He doesn't remember me, but...  Oh, but why?  You guys ran into each other? 
[00:08:30]  So I love you.  And he just...  He's like, hi.  I saw him at the cast party.  You could tell he just didn't know who you were?  Wouldn't have known me if I fucking...  If I danced with an open-ass t-shirt.  You probably sat two feet away from him for over an hour on our show.  Made no impact.  Made no impact.  None.  None whatsoever.  No.  And that bothers you, right?  I understand.  It's okay.  And...  Oh, Jimmy's so fucked up.  Helen Mirren was good as Hobson.  How were her boobs?  I didn't...  You know, it's like funny.  I met her and I didn't notice.  I wanted to bring Caligula and ask her to sign it. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And just fucking talk about her big tits.  Yeah.  But I got a picture over there.  She was really nice.  And...  Robin...  It's funny.  Robin Williams and Billy Crystal were at the after party.  Okay.  And...  Robin's very nice.  Like, I know him casually.  But I was just talking about his plays.  Doing a play.  And I heard he's...  It's great.  So we just started talking about Iraq and stuff and chit-chatting. 
[00:09:30]  And...  Billy Crystal made me laugh a lot.  Because I was like...  Because he had been talking to Helen Mirren.  And I'm like, do you think she'd mind if I went over and just told her how great her  tits were in Caligula?  And he's like, no, no, no.  You should probably...  You should have brought a picture and told her, like, with cum stains on it.  He said something really...  Holy shit.  Really filthy that you wouldn't expect...  Something really not Billy Crystal-ish.  Something that you would never expect Billy Crystal to say.  And it made me laugh.  But it was embarrassing because I went into a coughing fit.  Like, I was like...  I was like...  I was like, what the...  So I really... 
[00:10:00]  I really...  I really had a nice moment.  I ruined a nice moment.  Holy shit.  It was...  I ruined a nice moment.  I said hello to Russell, but I don't know if he remembers me.  I know he knows my face, but I don't know if he knows me from here or whatever.  Yeah.  Um...  His bodyguard remembered me, but I don't think he did.  Yeah.  And, uh...  Did he look excited to be there?  Or is he going through the...  Thank God.  Thank God.  Oh, hey, bro. 
[00:10:30]  Thank God.  Oh, what a stupid idea is morning radio.  Ronnie B in studio.  You have no idea how bad I need you today.  Yeah, I think you really helped us out today.  Holy shit.  What's up?  I can't believe morning radio really exists.  Didn't you used to do this?  Yeah, I did used to do it.  And seriously, coming in here?  Yeah.  There's no one out there.  No, I know.  Why do...  I don't...  Why do we still do it like this?  Because they don't...  They can't think outside the old school ways.  There's no reason to get up this early to do this anymore. 
[00:11:00]  No, you at least have another hour and a half.  We used to have it at XM.  We used to start at 7.  It was perfect.  Yeah, it makes perfect sense.  There's no one on the roads.  You know, they replay the show a shitload during the day.  People are listening to this whenever they want.  It's exactly true.  And you know, even coming past the Today Show, there was nobody...  None of the fans are outside.  Yeah, they're not even ready.  They're still in their hotels in Times Square getting their stupid egg sandwiches.  All right, so all you guys are really hurting bad this morning? 
[00:11:30]  Oh, boy.  Well, I...  Look at Jimmy.  I'm fucking tired.  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  Were you out?  Were you doing your stand-up last night?  I didn't.  I went to the Arthur premiere.  But he took day call at 7, 8 o'clock at night.  I took the wrong one.  So he had one of those nodding, I'm going to fall asleep, I'm going to wake up.  I'm going to fall asleep, I'm waking up.  I didn't want to cough during the fucking movie.  No.  It was like thoroughfuel day.  Jimmy is very slow now.  I'm a very bad sleeper.  But I'm very, very loopy today.  I could sense it's going to be a fucking rough go. 
[00:12:00]  No, doesn't Dayquil and Nyquil and all that kind of shit fuck with you a little bit?  No, no.  Dayquil and Nyquil, but I don't take them.  This was Theraflu.  Theraflu daytime.  It's all the same stuff, isn't it?  No, but I don't take anything.  Alcohol, I won't take.  Oh, the Nyquils have the alcohol?  Yeah, I don't know, but they scare me.  They get you wired.  Yeah, they do.  They get you thinking like, all right, this is a start.  Theraflu's okay, though, right?  Theraflu's not.  I don't play around with any of that.  No, Theraflu doesn't.  No.  No, but he's talking about the Arthur premiere. 
[00:12:30]  How was it?  It was okay.  I mean, it's a rough comedy to remake, you know, but there's some funny parts.  He's got to talk politically, if you know what I mean.  Oh, because...  Because, you know, he knows some people.  But I still...  Some people got him there, so this is what I'm feeling.  Jimmy didn't tell me that.  Yeah.  But I could read Jimmy, and I think he's being a little political right now.  I think he wants...  Because you know how hard people work to try to make something perfect.  I never care.  And then, in comedies, they blow it 95% of the time.  They don't mean to.  But it's a really hard thing to do to make a funny comedy. 
[00:13:00]  Russell Brand is good, though, man.  He's...  I don't know how people will like him, but I didn't know what to expect, but he's a fucking  good actor, I think.  He can carry movies.  He's a funny guy.  He certainly can.  You know, I don't know...  Nick Dalti was great, too, as Susan Johnson's father.  He was really funny.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  This is...  Theraplo.  He's got a theraplo.  Yeah, he's got a hacking cough.  Yeah.  Oh, it's fucking hideous.  Can we do the Billy Crystal thing for Ronnie?  No, he just said a joke.  He was at the after party, and I said, like, a joke to him. 
[00:13:30]  And he responded very filthy, which was very funny to me.  Right.  And I laughed, but, like, the laugh put me into, like, I can't even do it now because it  will make me cough.  But I was like, I laughed a little bit.  And I said, he didn't put me in that fucking thing.  I just wanted to do this all morning.  Look at him.  Oh, it's going to be a blue loop.  In front of Billy...  Ronnie, in front of Billy Crystal.  Yeah.  Ruining the moment.  Totally ruined the nice moment.  Because Billy had a great fucking dirty line. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, we had a nice chat with Robin, and then, you know, Billy just chatting about Helen  Mirren's breasts.  And, you know, he just tagged a joke I did, and he made it very filthy.  I just laughed and spoiled it.  Did everyone have to say, are you all right?  No, I just walked away.  I was like, I was saying goodnight to him.  Yeah.  And he's a nice guy, man.  The first time I met him many years ago, I didn't think he was nice.  And every time I've met him since, he's been very pleasant.  Yeah, you know the same people, right?  I think so, yeah.  Hey, are you talking about the Arthur movie on your show? 
[00:14:30]  No, I haven't said a word about it.  You know, I love the first one so much.  Oh, it's good, man.  You know, and it's not done for me.  You know what I mean?  I understand, like, if you said...  But I really am disappointed that they pussied out on the alcoholism thing, because that  was...  Supposedly there's alcohol in this.  Oh, yeah.  He's a drunk.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, yes.  In the commercials, it just seems like he's a big kid.  That's what pissed us off.  No, no, he's a drunk.  They avoid the alcohol in the commercials in the preview.  There is one really funny scene. 
[00:15:00]  It just shows a 12-step meeting, and there's a guy qualifying, speaking about his addiction,  and that made me laugh, the guy, because it was really showing just how some people  have these awful stories, and a couple of the things he was...  There was one very funny scene, I won't blow up, about a 12-step meeting, but no, he's  a drunk.  They didn't show him drunk driving, or did they?  I'm trying to think Hobson drove most of the time.  Well, in the original, that's how it was.  I mean, not Hobson, I'm sorry, Bitterman.  Yeah, yeah, but Arthur drunk drove.  Bitterman. 
[00:15:30]  Bitterman.  He drunk drove in the first one, though.  He drove to Susan's house, and then he drove on his date, and he was drinking.  Oh, yeah.  Dudley Moore was just a charming fucking dude, man.  Well, he was amazing.  He had that one period that he was just, like, one film after another, just bash, bash,  bash, and then something happened to him, I don't know.  But what makes a movie, it's weird, what makes a movie feel not done?  Disjointed or not, like, even a funny movie or well-written, what makes a movie just fucking  flow?  Like, you look at the original Arthur, and compared to a lot of other movies, it just 
[00:16:00]  worked.  Yeah.  There was a charm to it, and I can't describe what worked about it, but Gielgud was amazing.  Helen Mirren was also good.  She's fucking, she's an Oscar winner.  It didn't feel as right, though, but maybe if I didn't see the original, it would feel  more natural.  Because I know Gielgud.  Good editor?  Yeah, I mean, editing's got to play just...  They say editing is so fucking important.  Second director.  Particularly in comedy.  Because, like, you're so dependent on that person to go back and do it properly. 
[00:16:30]  And, like, even if you watch the jackass movies, I don't know who's editing that, but they  got their shit together.  There's always really good pacing.  Because, you know, you can watch some, you know, you can take the same stuff, shuffle  it, and go, oh, God.  Sure.  This is fucking painful.  That's how it's put together.  You're right.  Yeah.  The editor is very underrated and very important.  The editor, a bad editor can ruin a fucking film, man.  Right.  And they never get the credit.  In the business, they do, but they don't get the credit a director will get.  No, never.  But the editor's, man, can ruin you. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, and, you know, like, Tarantino, his editor died.  He used the same editor in every single thing.  Yeah.  And there's so many things that work comedically in a Tarantino film.  Mm-hmm.  And we'll have to see if that, you know, keeps going, if that person's just got him down.  Well, they said that they would argue a lot, too, him and his editor.  They said that she would.  Well, that's good.  But, yeah, but she could tell him, it's got to come out.  Right.  And she knew and was usually right.  And they say good editors never go to the fucking set.  They don't get to know the actors. 
[00:17:30]  They don't give a shit how much work went into a scene.  They don't want to know.  They just want to see it as an audience member and fix it.  So they don't feel bad, like, oh, that one bit was so good.  Yeah.  They spent a million dollars on that car chase.  Yeah, they always wanted it to work.  They just have to be, no, this is it.  Right.  But it's weird.  Like, a lot of times, even when, like, they'll redo a director's cut, I'll still feel like, well, this feels fucked.  You know?  Of course.  Of the director's cut.  Yeah, sometimes it just doesn't have that same flow.  And I don't, I still, it's kind of interesting.  I would like to know why, like, even when you get into a four-hour movie or something, you're like, this, they've lost me. 
[00:18:00]  I mean, what is that thing of, you just can't go any longer with them?  Did you see the director's cut of Apocalypse?  No, we talked about that on the show, how horrendous it is.  Because the editor made that movie amazing.  Yeah.  Coppola, what the editor took out was brilliant.  I think the director's cuts, they're too close to it.  It's their baby.  So they think everything they just shot is brilliant and amazing.  So they do have a tough time cutting that shit out.  That's why, you know, having an editor like, you know, Quentin Tarantino had there. 
[00:18:30]  It's true.  It's like if you go to someone's house and they start to show you pictures, they always go too long.  Like, dude, fucking, please.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Right.  You lost me five minutes ago with the pictures.  You're off.  But, so last night, people were probably laughing a lot harder because they're all the show people and they're all caught up in it.  And they're like, I can't believe how great this is.  Yeah, there was a few really good lines, too.  Like, there was a few really good laughs in it. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And I heard it tested very well.  Like, before the movie, I was talking to somebody and he goes, they've screened it in a few places.  It's done very, very well.  They always say that.  They find an audience that'll love anything.  Yeah.  I mean, it got laughs.  To make themselves feel better.  It certainly got good laughs.  I mean, and I'm like, it's hard once you've seen the original.  And I hate such a thing about Remade Cotton.  I'll say this.  There were parts of it that I really liked.  But Jennifer Garner, it's hard to be convinced that he would not have kept her.  And went for Greta Gerwig because Liza Minnelli, we were just saying, 
[00:19:30]  had such fucking, she was so charismatic in the first one.  Yeah.  She had charm.  Even though she looks like a fucking animal.  Yeah, we don't know.  Right, right.  Right.  She was that awful yellow coat.  She was so funny.  That's why he likes her.  Because the other chick's a bore and she's funny like he is.  Right.  Who played Liza Minnelli's father?  Greta Gerwig.  No, father.  I love that fucking guy.  He was the greatest.  He was the greatest.  There's no way you could find someone like him for the Remade.  No.  No, he didn't have a big part of the father. 
[00:20:00]  He didn't.  They kind of just sort of.  Well, they don't even show the Liza Minnelli girl in the trailer, right?  Like you're not even.  Not really.  It's all about the Batman shit.  Well, what do you think of comedies being Remade?  We've talked about this a lot on our show.  We hate it, just so you know.  You know, but see, the thing is, is like, I don't think it can ruin it for you if you have that thing like, you know, that Arthur, that first one, it still exists for you.  And there's no way that you can get people that are like 15 or 16 years old and get them to watch the old comics. 
[00:20:30]  They just won't do it.  Right.  I don't know.  I wasn't like that when I was younger.  I like to watch all kinds of, you know, Turner Classic movie type shit.  But you try to show that to kids now, and they're like, what?  Like, they're ready to remake E.T. because the kids are growing up going, I want to watch E.T.  Right.  So make it for me.  Yeah.  Give me something new.  What is that?  Also, the graphics could be better.  E.T. is something that you could use CGI for, like King Kong.  You could improve it with CGI, although some of the heart of the movie you might not get. 
[00:21:00]  I remember thinking that in 82.  I'm like, I can't wait to CGI's invented.  We can get out of this shit.  But see, Pink Panther is the one we always go to, and we don't want to think Steve Martin  is the Pink Panther.  I've never watched it.  I never did either, which is not fair, because I killed the movie.  But we want to think fucking Peter Sellers, because that movie was perfect.  That series was perfect.  I've seen moments of it, and I've seen pieces horrendous.  I tried to watch it once, because I judged it so harshly. 
[00:21:30]  It was bad.  And it annoyed me, because Steve Martin's a funny fucking comedic actor.  And it's like, dude, you're one of the guys who can pick and choose what you want to do.  And Peter Sellers is a guy that he should have had enough respect for to fucking leave  alone.  What, are you going to redo Being There next?  Some other fucking brilliant work he did?  It's like, come on, man.  Guy's dead.  He had an amazing franchise.  You're not going to be funnier than him.  I would never have the audacity to go up there and do, to put a fucking thing on my head  and go, I'm wild and crazy. 
[00:22:00]  Because that's Steve Martin's shit.  I'd be fucking stealing it.  Right.  You know what I mean?  There's a fine line, I guess.  I'm with you.  I mean, if these people are so creative, come up with a new character.  Come up with a new movie.  Peter Sellers did so much amazing shit.  I was just, Lolita was on that too long ago.  He is so fucking brilliant in that, that I kept stopping the movie and going, I can't  fucking believe how good he is.  I didn't see.  I haven't seen it in years.  Kubrick directed it.  God, he's amazing in it. 
[00:22:30]  I didn't see.  I got to see that.  James Mason, right?  James Mason, yes.  Lolita.  It's like this, I mean, first of all, you couldn't even make that movie now.  I think they even tried to remake it and take it out.  But it was so fucking, you know, this is an older guy after like a 12-year-old girl.  And the guy who's trying to stop is the other guy who wants to fuck her.  And they're just awful.  They're just terrible.  And it's just like brilliance.  You know, I didn't even know Peter Sellers was in that.  I got to be completely honest with you.  Now I'm going to go home and watch this.  There's a Peter Sellers dance scene in that fucking movie that's as funny as anything you've 
[00:23:00]  ever seen in your life.  Really?  He's like kind of an Andy Warhol downtown type of guy.  And he's just doing this stupid dance and this stuff.  And like, he's not going out of his way to be funny.  It's just that he's the funniest human being that ever walked out there.  And I mean, it's unstoppable.  I haven't seen it in years.  It is a funny movie.  I want to see it again.  Because Sellers was great.  He was insane.  Was it supposed to be funny? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Sellers, like the Sellers part is funny and none of the rest of the movie.  And once again, why does that work?  Why could you take this guy that's kind of a two-dimensional character, stick him in this movie,  and it just works?  Him in, I think, the Revenge of the Pink Panther, when he's on the fucking, the parallel bars,  and when he's cocky, and he says, oh, the parallel bar, and he fucking dismounts and falls  down a flight of steps.  It's as basic as you can be, and it's comedically perfect. 
[00:24:00]  The cockiness of that motherfucker before he hops on those bars, and then he just sails  over the edge.  It's fucking amazingly funny.  It is truly one of the funniest things that's ever happened.  I always laugh at those movies.  The absurdity, how he kept his sanity during the absurdity.  Yeah.  And that's what Steve Martin lost.  Like, Peter Sellers was fucking, was swinging his arm around with a fucking mace on it, and  he was breaking shit, and he was just keeping his cool.  He was trying to hold on to being in this serious moment. 
[00:24:30]  He didn't fucking wink at the camera like stupid Steve Martin did.  I'm going to have to fucking do a Peter Sellers marathon.  You got to.  Dr. Stranglove.  You got to.  I got to see Lolita.  Lolita.  Lolita.  So Arthur, thumbs up, down.  Two thumbs up.  Two giant thumbs up.  Go say it.  I'll give it in the middle.  I'm not going to say it sucks, because again, it's hard to judge, because if it sucked,  if I thought it sucked, I would at least wink at you.  I don't think it sucked, but I...  Gotcha.  But we're going to take a half a star, because you got some politics going on with this thing. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to give it two stars, even though I never saw it.  Are you going to go?  I would go for the show, I guess.  The radio show.  There's a lot of things I do for the radio show that I would never do in real...  Are you like that?  So it's like show prep to you?  It's like...  No, absolutely.  Because Roland drags me to a bunch of these screenings, and I do it, yes, for the show.  No.  You don't do any of that.  You say, fuck it.  I say that the radio audience has to adapt to my weird fucking taste.  I don't want to go out there and mass appeal to those people.  I'm just the opposite. 
[00:25:30]  I'm on satellite.  But see, we like to beat shit up on our show, so...  So yeah, you like to...  So I'll search out stuff that...  You like to see the worst fucking thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Good.  See, we have different philosophies.  I like your philosophy, though.  I wish I could do that.  I'm trying to mold the audience down until it's just me.  Knowing me and some other guy's going, you're right, that fucking book is amazing.  I'm glad you talked about that for two hours.  But see, the thing is, I do think that you still, you've got that radio background, and  you're looking at the clock, and hey... 
[00:26:00]  I'm trying not to.  You want to be a professional.  I'm trying to let it go now.  I'm really trying to let it go, finally.  Because the truth is, the entire way that you were raised was wrong.  At fucking 6 o'clock to start the show is insane.  6.15.  Oh, you started...  No, no, no.  We started at 6.  Because I said that on the way in, I'm like, uh, they're not going to be there.  I was having this, like, fucking, like, smiling moment when no one else was out there.  And my chick was like, you're going to be late.  I'm going to go, no.  You're going to be late, like you're going to have to be? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, like, you want to do it, get back into it.  When was the last time you did a morning show, Ronnie?  Oh, it was a long time ago.  It was a long time ago.  And I remember when I did the Ron and Ron show in Florida, the first break was always  about whatever the AM news station was just talking about on the way in, because you didn't  have any fucking show prep.  So you just come in, wow, did you hear about that study that they just did?  We're lucky.  We got a lot of great guys behind the scenes, but a lot of the times it comes down to ant. 
[00:27:00]  What do you hear on the way in?  Oh, I heard that too.  All right, let's start there.  Yeah, it was never a good idea to do this, and I don't know who invented it.  And I think it's even pushed back, because a lot of guys will start at like 5.30.  Yeah, oh, five even.  But see, during our last negotiation, I'm like, look, let's go back to seven.  Right.  Oh, you're losing the passion for this?  I'm like, no, it just makes more sense.  Seven was fun.  But who said passion to you, though, seriously?  You know, Scott. 
[00:27:30]  Who doesn't really get that part of it?  You can't do this without passion.  No, those guys don't get it at all.  At all.  It's fine.  What was I going to say?  You said something.  Oh, the reason for seven, though, that I explained to them was you get some West Coast action.  Yeah, absolutely.  Isn't this a national platform?  Yeah.  But they still focus like it's an East Coast thing.  Let's face it.  There's people in L.A.  But there's people in L.A. listening.  Maybe not right now, but they'll listen on the replay to, you know, Ron and Fez and us later on. 
[00:28:00]  I hope not.  I just want to keep them off now.  Why?  Why care?  You know, here's the thing, Jimmy.  I wanted to ask you about it, too.  Why in the last six months has every comic started a podcast?  Remember a couple of years ago, just a couple of guys were doing it?  And now, I swear to God, there's got to be 500 of them.  Because I think that they see it starting to work.  Like, I've thought of it like, why don't I have a podcast?  And I'm like, I'm on a radio show.  Right.  Like, I don't need one.  That's the beauty of doing this.  They all just want to do this because this is so much fucking fun.  But why didn't they do it when all these radio stations were looking for shows? 
[00:28:30]  They probably, again, once you see a guy doing it at home and just hanging.  Like, Bill Burr, I haven't heard Bill Burr, but I heard it's good.  Rogan's I've done.  It's great.  I did a two and a half hour one with Joe Rogan when I was out there.  We got an audience together in Kevin Smith's Smodcast Place.  I called him the night before.  I'm like, I'd love to do your podcast.  He goes, we'll do it tomorrow.  How's the Kevin Smith Smodcastle?  Great.  It's a small little space.  That's meant for you.  It's fucking phenomenal, dude.  You haven't heard about Kevin Smith?  He has a tiny little theater out there. 
[00:29:00]  How many people does it sit?  Maybe 80, 60.  60, 80 people.  50, maybe.  It was a great little intimate space.  He's doing so much fucking shit.  But he's doing it at a bigger club sometimes, too, now.  Kevin sells so many fucking tickets, man.  I don't know why I'm so animated with that.  It's a great idea.  You just find a little theater somewhere, a little space for yourself, and do your podcast  in front of people that care enough to come out.  Kevin is the one who started this.  He was the one who...  This Smodcast little place.  But Carolla's podcast is the one.  He was the first.  But he's a radio guy, too. 
[00:29:30]  Yes.  For real.  Mark Maron, too.  Mark Maron, yeah.  He wasn't the first.  No, no, but his is catching so much.  I think Kevin Smith was the first kind of...  Well, he's not really a stand-up.  No, he's not a stand-up.  No, but it's like, I'm going to do my own version.  What?  Your mic...  I don't know what that was, E-Rock, but please don't do that.  Your mic was so loud.  What are you trying to tell me?  Like a timing thing?  I have no idea what he just said.  I don't like the idea he says shit just to you.  And me and Jimmy can't.  Yeah, he does it a lot. 
[00:30:00]  He's like, fuck those guys.  Whispers things.  You're the good one, Opie.  Fuck those guys.  Well, you're going to know every time he says something to me, because I'm going to have  to throw my headphones...  Good.  E-Rock, it's something that...  Mars isn't here, so there might be a few adjustments that still need to be made.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry.  Sorry, I was just saying Kevin started in early 2007.  Was that on the air or just me?  That's on the air.  That's on the air.  Okay.  Same.  But also hurt.  But as the comedians, Marin's catching a lot of thing in Rogan.  Rogan's is on fucking fire.  But...  Like, he sells a lot of tickets from that, man, because... 
[00:30:30]  But now middle acts are doing it.  Yeah.  It's just like, you know, yeah, it's just like, why overnight are you suddenly all acting  like...  And you're right, like, for years, they could have came in and been doing radio.  Easily.  But they didn't...  I don't know, maybe they looked down at us.  Oh, they did.  They did, right?  They did.  No, I'm being honest.  No, 100%.  Sometimes I can't read you.  But I think stand-ups in general look down at us.  They don't like getting up.  That's all it is.  I think stand-ups like radio, but they don't like waking up.  Like, me and Colin were talking one time, and he had to get up in the morning.  He's like, I'm tired. 
[00:31:00]  I'm like, shut the fuck up.  I do this every day.  He's like, oh, yeah.  But with the podcast, like Ronnie's saying, you can do it whenever you want.  Do whatever you want.  You roll out of bed and go, I think I'm going to start in an hour.  And with Twitter, Facebook, and all these other places, you just fucking tell the people  when you're going to start.  And you can control it.  Comics like that fucking...  I mean, everyone likes control, but comedians are used to controlling their environment.  Your own podcast.  I did this dude in L.A.  I figured he's a comedian.  I know.  I'm just blanking on his name because I'm tired.  But we sat in his apartment, and to meet him and his partner, he had a professional fucking 
[00:31:30]  setup.  Yeah.  How many people are these podcasts?  You never know.  They all exaggerate.  Rogan's pretty big.  Rogan's got about, I think, a quarter million.  Gets a quarter million people?  I believe so.  Rogan is very...  He's an amazingly good podcast.  See, obviously, the problem is that no one's selling it yet.  No one's making money off this thing.  No one's making money off it.  Is Corolla even making it?  Because I know he's doing some stuff with AOL.  Maybe a little, finally.  Yeah.  You know, nothing like he was making when he was working for CBS.  From AOL, probably.  He's making something, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But they're pushing him, too, because every time you click on AOL, there's a Corolla... 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  You know, Adam said, or Kevin said, because Kevin Smith's doing it with AOL, too.  But I couldn't believe I thought of doing a podcast.  I'm like, you're on a radio show, you fuck.  Like, why would I think that?  See, that's the other side of it.  Those guys are like, ah, this is so much fun.  But to do the 20-hour-a-week grind, because they're doing like an hour a week, and their  friend is with...  Do that in my sleep.  Exactly.  To do 20 hours, forget it.  Not to take away from those guys, but like Ronnie said, this is a fucking...  I know people listening right now have way tougher lives, so I acknowledge that. 
[00:32:30]  I don't think so.  You don't want to acknowledge that.  You've got the hardest life of anyone.  Because they get so fucking mad, but everything is a grind after a while, you know?  Seriously, I'd rather be in a lathe so many days.  I'd rather just be sitting there with goggles on, fucking hearing about one of my friends  losing his finger, than being in here with Fezzy going, what's wrong, man?  Come on.  You love doing this.  You remember?  It's like fucking doing triage.  I can't laugh. 
[00:33:00]  Seriously, you're that sick, you're that hurt?  Dude, when I laugh, it's going to send me into a coughing jag.  It's at that point where I feel like I want to laugh, and I'm like...  That might be good.  Oh, yeah, it's going to get it out.  I think it's going to get something a lot worse than a cold, though.  I think...  It might take something else.  I wouldn't surprise any of us, let's be honest.  My uncle kind of had that same exact thing before he passed, and it turned into tuberculosis.  It's getting given off his tuberculosis feel about you, right?  It certainly would not surprise me at all if I caught something.  Oh, boy.  Now Jimmy's going to think about it. 
[00:33:30]  He's got like a fucking coal miner thing going on.  Yeah, he does.  I know a lot of coal miners in Pennsylvania, and you've got the whole vibe right now.  You look like one.  I was thinking diverticulitis.  Somebody straightened me out on Twitter.  He goes, you're the only guy whose go-to disease is diverticulitis.  I'm like, really, I'm an ass.  Are you a guy who likes to...  If I could read about a disease, though, you suddenly...  If I hear symptoms that remind me, like, diverticulitis, I thought, because Lesnar had it, and then my friend Reed had it,  and then I'm like, I've had some real stomach pains lately, and then my immune system is failing me. 
[00:34:00]  I feel like I'm getting sick, but then again, I'm flying constantly, so maybe...  Right, but you thought you had it after we interviewed Lesnar.  That's fucking weird.  I was getting stomach pains after I ate recently.  I ate a lot of nuts, and I...  Let me pause.  Yeah.  If I could tweet that.  Yeah, you hear him.  See you.  But I eat a lot of fucking, like, walnuts and almonds and stuff, and I would get real stomach pain sometimes.  I'm like, is this a fucking...  Did I tear the lining of my stomach? 
[00:34:30]  No, you're fine.  My colon.  You're fine.  I think you did.  Am I leaking shit into my intestine?  Seriously, it does...  It fucking...  It has that vibe of, like, leaking shit.  I had to get off WebMD.  That shit's dangerous.  It's a chart that leads to cancer, no matter what.  No matter what.  I mean, there's something like one out of every four people dies from cancer, and one out of every four people dies from heart disease.  Right.  So you pretty much, unless you're in, like, a fucking gun battle, you know how you're going to go out.  And it's...  Every one of them is awful.  But why does the WebMD lead to cancer every time when it might be... 
[00:35:00]  You know, you'd think you have a little cold or something.  Well, that's where it starts.  It's unbelievable.  Do you get a lot of colds?  No.  Not as much as I used to.  See, that's scary, because that doesn't build up your immunity.  Your fucking immunity is not going to be ready in cancer.  Ronnie's a buzzkill, man.  Yeah.  No, I want to be out front there, because my brother's a fucking doctor, so I study a lot of stuff.  So it's good to get a lot of colds?  Yes.  Fuck yeah.  Get a lot of colds.  And I'm in great shape.  Every time I get off a plane, I'm fucking sick. 
[00:35:30]  Aren't you the cold-getting kid?  I really am the cold-getting kid.  You know what it is?  I sleep with the air blowing on me.  Oh, Jesus.  And that's just germs.  That's not good.  Please.  It's germs.  It's germs.  Please.  That stuff is awful for you.  I was hoping Jay was going to do a set with us today.  What's the story with him, man?  You and Jay together are just great.  He's doing a corporate gig in Atlanta.  He might call in.  What has happened with him, though?  What do you mean?  Like, he used to want to be with you all the time, and now it's just like, oh, I'm doing corporate gigs. 
[00:36:00]  No, he wanted to.  No, I don't think he's got that gig.  You think he's just hanging somewhere?  Yeah.  But what would be your top five Stones songs?  Because when we were talking Stones, I was thinking Rod and Jay.  I know that you've been into a top five thing lately.  No.  Yeah, you have.  You've been top five, and I've seen your Twitter.  You're top five in a lot.  Top five Stones.  See, I'd have to put Moonlight Mile on there.  I think it's one of the most amazing songs ever done.  And that's the whole era for me. 
[00:36:30]  So that era I would probably pick all five songs out of.  Something for the Devil has to be on the list.  Absolutely.  That was on my list.  It's amazing.  Absolutely.  The live Midnight Rambler has to be on the list.  Nice.  I'm not going to go way deep on everybody.  I'm not going to go girl with a kaleidoscope eyes so that there's someone driving along  going, yeah.  Yeah, man.  I knew he fucking...  I don't know.  I'm not...  Jay went with Fingerprint File. 
[00:37:00]  See, that's...  I didn't even know the song.  I would do that, too, if I was him.  I would like...  But then I listened to the song.  I could get into that.  It's all great.  I certainly could get into it.  I'd never heard the song before.  I'm not going to front and make believe I did.  I put a version of Under My Thumb.  It didn't make my final list, but there's a live version from the 60s of them doing Under  My Thumb.  It's an amazing song.  But there's a...  It is a great song, but the one version of them doing it on some British TV show is fucking...  It's amazing how good it is.  It really annoys me. 
[00:37:30]  It's so...  I don't know why.  I shouldn't...  Mick Jagger is either really great or he's really awful.  I can't figure out whether I like him or I think he stinks.  There was that period, though, when, like, right after Brian Jones died and they made  the fucking move, and they were just...  They were on fire.  And I just read this thing the other day.  It's because they heard the basement tapes.  They heard the basement tapes with Dylan and the band, and they said, fuck, we got to  do something different.  And that's when they went in and did a lot better music. 
[00:38:00]  This is the version here?  I think so, yeah.  I just like it.  Oh, yeah.  Pretty basic, actually.  I just...  I know.  But I just like this.  I like Mick in this a lot.  It's horrible dancing.  What are they on, Ronnie? 
[00:38:30]  They're on the fucking 60s right there.  Yeah, but look at that.  What is she on?  In the front row.  That's fucking...  I want to fuck Mick so bad, I'm going to faint.  That's all that is?  That's all that is.  You don't think it's a pill?  No.  That's all that is.  That's what he's got right.  I think he just got isolated.  Huh?  Someone just isolated that.  Yeah, it's a pretty basic version.  I know, but I just like it.  I guess because of the visual. 
[00:39:00]  I like the way he's singing this.  I like more of the trippy Stones and the trippy Beatles songs.  What's trippy for you?  Where are we going out here?  A little Gimme Shelter would be cool.  That's a great fucking song.  As far as the Beatles, I Am the Walrus is one of my favorites of all time.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  I didn't like that.  Ron had to take his glasses off on that one.  I know, he didn't.  Ron, it's like, I'm going home.  I want to get really serious.  I just took him off for a second.  I couldn't believe what I just heard.  Give me your last two on your Stones list. 
[00:39:30]  Is Gimme Shelter on there?  Gimme Shelter is the fucking...  I always thought of it as the dope kick song, too.  I know it's supposed to be in Vietnam, but to me it was always,  I have to fucking cop right away.  Because I think that was that era.  I don't know what it was about with Keith when he did heroin.  It was unbelievably great.  I'm not so crazy about him before or after heroin,  but during his heroin years.  So it's phenomenal.  That's a good commercial for heroin, then.  And it is.  That's the problem.  Like most things are.  Like most things are. 
[00:40:00]  Like if you saw anything...  Like I even remember hearing Lou Reed when I was a kid  and going like this.  And I would be like 12 and I'm going like,  Oh, heroin.  It's fucking great, doesn't it?  Like you're nodding and your friends are dying.  This is really great.  I never got into Lou Reed.  Oh, God.  I know.  I know.  I know.  It's one of your...  You love Lou Reed?  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, I love the...  I couldn't even name a bunch of...  I like the song you guys play.  What's the song your show goes on? 
[00:40:30]  I heard that and I downloaded it because I heard it on your guys' show.  But that's a great song.  I've never been a Lou Reed fan except for the colored girl goes,  a dude, a dude.  I know.  But he's kind of toxic.  I didn't even want to say that to Ronnie.  He would laugh at me.  No, that's okay.  There's nothing wrong there.  What's that called?  20,000 times.  Wildside.  Well, take a walk on the wild side.  Does he talk sing every song, though?  Yeah, he kind of does.  He does.  He lives downtown and that's his whole fucking thing.  You know, I thought you were like, he's got a lot of tranny songs in there.  I think you'd be able to...  I didn't know that, but I'm certainly more interested to hear him now. 
[00:41:00]  Okay, he was the first person who went on like, these trannies are fun.  I don't think anyone else did that.  You know, and it was like...  First of all, it was like 65 where it was still like, leave it to beaver.  Sure.  But, you know, let's fucking be honest because we could go deep.  And yes, I know.  I should have said far away eyes.  It's not kaleidoscope.  I got the fucking Beatles and Stones.  I haven't been up this early in years.  Well, Jimmy had As Tears Go By.  That's a good one.  Oh, it's a great fucking song.  And actually the first song those guys ever wrote in their lives. 
[00:41:30]  Really?  That was their first song.  Did you say that?  I did, yeah.  And Marianne Faithful sang it first, but then they took it and sang it.  And then I...  After it was a hit.  Like, I gave this to you and I'll wait.  I got killed because I threw Ruby Tuesday on there.  But then someone backed me up and said, Keith Richards said Ruby Tuesday, one of his favorite  stones of all time.  One of his favorite songs of all time.  Why would people beat you up over it?  What is that about?  Because it got played on the radio?  It's a chick song.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Jay used the word gay. 
[00:42:00]  He said it was gay.  See, that's him playing that game of his.  And you don't need that.  No.  But even though I sat around and was pregnant.  And you don't need...  Can I tell you how happy that made me?  And you don't need that.  He's gone through so much.  He's gone through so much.  He doesn't need it.  But you shouldn't be ashamed of what you like.  And you don't need that.  You know, I fucking even hate when someone says something, it's their guilty pleasure.  It's just your pleasure.  It's just your pleasure.  You're right.  It's just, you know, if you like the monkeys, fuck. 
[00:42:30]  Take it home and listen to it.  That's it.  Own it.  But having said that, Satisfaction is probably the greatest fucking rock and roll song.  Our fucking list was similar.  And Jumpin' Jack Flash is an amazing fucking rock and roll song.  And everyone in the fucking world knows it.  But then you kind of put it aside.  You wouldn't say you'd say Paint It Black?  It's a great song.  I mean, seriously.  That's why it's tough to make a list.  They had so many.  Everyone sits around and talks about that.  And again, you know, here's the weirdest thing. 
[00:43:00]  Because Mick Taylor, for me, that's the era that I fucking love the best.  And somebody hooked me up on the phone with him not too long ago.  Like, about a year ago.  And he's like in some cold water flat in London.  Just fucking, he's got Jimmy's cough.  He's just like, I don't know.  I haven't worked in a long time.  And it's just like nothing.  You know, when he took that fucking Stones banner off.  Bye.  You know, we only like the Stones.  But that whole era was just fucking amazing.  What years was he in?  Like, I guess it was right after Brian Jones died. 
[00:43:30]  So it was like, I don't know, like a 68, 69 to like 73.  I'm sure there's a fucking lot of.  That was it?  Yeah.  You only did four or five years.  Yeah, it was a very short thing.  And then Charlie came in.  Wow.  So.  Wow.  No, you know what?  It might have been even longer.  It might have been like a 74, 75.  Okay.  Whenever Charlie came in.  Yeah, but still.  Oh, Charlie Watts came in then?  I didn't know that.  No, Woods.  Charlie Woods came in late.  Charlie Watts was there from the beginning.  Ron Wood.  Ron Woods. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  I'm fucking crazy.  I can't do this in the morning.  It's too fucking crazy for me.  Who can?  You're doing fine, Ron.  Luckily, there's no listeners yet.  Not that you need me to tell you.  The listeners don't wake up until 11.  Yeah, but the problem is they're wide awake when they hear this on the replay.  Oh, fuck that.  That's the problem.  Well, see, if they're waking up like you're waking up, then it's fine.  What time do you go to bed at night?  I used to go, now about 10, because I want to start enjoying my fucking life.  I was going to bed at 8.30, 9.  I was one of those idiots. 
[00:44:30]  And a little nap on top of it.  In the afternoon?  Nap, it doesn't work, though.  No, that kills.  I had to stop, because it was ruining my life.  Yeah, the napping sucks.  Yet, does anything feel better than a nap?  A nap feels better.  An hour nap is way better than sleeping.  Yeah, short term.  The only thing better than a nap is waking up from a nap, and your girlfriend is left.  That's better than a nap.  But now I go to bed with the kid.  So the kid goes around 10, and he's sleeping in our bed.  How old is the kid? 
[00:45:00]  11 months almost.  He ate you already.  That's the guy keeping me away from who I really want to be with.  When did you get the kids out of your bed?  No, they're still there.  But that's for a whole different reason.  That's a whole, you know, then I got needy.  But they say it's the worst thing that you could possibly do.  What?  Is like, let the kid in your bed, particularly when you've got a boy.  Because he's planning on killing you right now. 
[00:45:30]  Sure.  And that's, I mean, that's genetically in your soul to go, I have to separate that man from the woman I love.  You're not wrong.  No, you didn't feel that way because you weren't crazy about your mom, right?  You were just like, I hope she goes out.  I was hoping my mom would go out before my dad, yeah.  Then you could really, then you guys could do all the stuff you wanted to.  So we always thought, we always thought that.  Go camping.  We always thought my dad would have a few years of peace if my mom went first. 
[00:46:00]  That's bullshit.  They were in love.  Yeah, isn't that the weirdest thing?  They were dysfunctional, but they were in love.  My dad would have never wished that.  My dad would have wished to God first, and that's what happened.  So, yeah, you get these fucking romantic thoughts in your head.  Like, Dad will now, like, maybe find a woman that, you know, loves them, a normal broad, and they'll go to the Caribbean.  You guys go fishing, and you go great with her, and she begs.  You're like, oh, my God, this is the best Christmas we've ever had. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, you just called me out on something, but you are so right.  Well, I can see through you.  That's a sad thing.  I mean, I can do the same thing that Jay can, but I don't hold it against you or use it against you.  I'm here to help nurture.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  What was your – the other thing, last great Rolling Stones song.  I go to Tattoo You.  I don't go past Tattoo You.  See, I might even go Ted Soup it. 
[00:47:00]  I'm not even crazy about Tattoo You, yeah.  And maybe I shouldn't say great, but the last Stones song I really got into was Waiting.  I got a friend.  It's a great song.  But then after that –  It's a great song.  I hate to start me up, and they play it fucking every time you see them.  Yeah.  Now, have you ever went and seen them?  Yeah.  You always have a bad time.  You have such expectations, because you want to see what Jimmy just showed us, them in like 65 or something.  And they're just polished and corporate.  Yeah, well, it's a giant fucking stage.  Right. 
[00:47:30]  You know, that thing that they did at the Beacon, I would have loved to have been at.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  That would have been so much fun.  But I've never seen them where I didn't go, oh, God, I really thought it was going to be better.  But I've never seen them live.  I'd love to.  You know what's really funny?  You've got to get there early and see – they always have great people open for them.  I mean, fabulous people.  And then they don't let them use the whole stage and all the equipment.  And it's really fucking funny, because you go there, and it's like a 100-yard stage.  And then you've got to see the fucking band, and it'll be like Chili Peppers. 
[00:48:00]  And you'll see that they're stuck in a little pen.  You know what I mean?  And you're like, well, these guys have the number one fucking album right now.  I've seen Van Halen be forced into that fucking pen, Jay Giles Band, whoever it happened to be.  Get into that fucking pen and don't touch anything else.  And then Mick comes out, and he has to drive a car from one end to the other, and he's waving to people.  They are so fucking mean to their opening acts.  They pretty much make them perform on an amp, just an amp that's set up for the Stones. 
[00:48:30]  Well, remember, Lars called in, because Metallica opened for them.  Anybody would open for them.  Yeah, because you want that on your resume.  Just to do it once.  And Lars said they wanted a picture with the Stones.  And this was a few years ago.  And he said they had to wait in this tunnel.  Metallica is waiting.  And the Stones finally came in, and they had their own photographers take the picture.  And then Metallica was told that if Mick is cool with the picture, you'll get it.  Mick has to approve all photos. 
[00:49:00]  But I'm like, I kind of like that, though.  Wow.  Because the Stones treated Metallica the way Metallica would have treated me, which is pretty much, you know, wait, and if we like it, we'll give it to you.  And Mick don't care.  He doesn't give a fuck.  Mick Jagger, he doesn't care.  I met him briefly backstage in Syracuse with Brother Weez.  When John Sher was promoting concerts big and heavy.  Was it bigger than life, though?  I was dumbfounded.  I, yeah, I almost collapsed.  I didn't even attempt to say anything.  You almost collapsed?  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  Not like a girl or anything, but we were saying this the other day, another top five list.  Top five most famous people in the world.  And you've got to put Mick on that list.  When you see someone like that, holy shit, like something happens to you.  All right, because you guys have met a lot of people.  Who was the most famous person you ever met?  I would say Bill Clinton.  Yeah, that's a big one.  No, was it while he was president?  Just after?  When we got fired, whenever that was.  So he was out a couple years, I guess, at that point.  Yeah.  I fucking met the, I had to bring out the first President Bush. 
[00:50:00]  Just started radio, right?  And they did this, my fucking boss at the time was somehow involved in the Republican Party.  He's like, I want you guys to bring out the president.  I'm like, fucking nuts.  That ain't going to happen.  Wait, he was actually the president?  Yeah, he was the president.  He wasn't running.  At the time.  Wow.  So I'm like, that ain't going to fucking happen.  So he calls back and he goes, yeah, it's going to happen.  We already got, your credentials are going through.  I go, what are you talking about?  He was like, your background check.  I go, don't background check me, motherfucker. 
[00:50:30]  You know, because I had fucking things, blah, blah, blah.  I don't know, somehow I got in.  So we're on fucking stage.  You have to show up early.  And we're like backstage and we're like fucking talking to these guys and shit that they were like Secret Service.  They were like early 30s, 35, regular fucking dudes.  After about an hour, the fucking, the president starts coming, right?  And it's coming down this fucking highway.  The guys that we were just hanging out with backstage fucking turned and looked at us like they wanted to kill us. 
[00:51:00]  They just stood in front of us and glared at us like bad dogs.  And I was like, hey, remember, and he fucking, now he's not answering.  His whole attitude taught, I'm past, I'm through, blah, blah, blah.  And they fucking turn around and act like I'll kill you if you fucking do anything stupid.  So I'm watching this come down the road with like, you know, the cop cars and all.  I swear to God, it was like an electrical storm was coming. 
[00:51:30]  The fucking energy around the standing president of the United States, you can't even compare.  So I was supposed to go out, and I had been like on stage and I'm fucking doing jokes and shit.  And like everything had changed, and no one thought anything was like good anymore, right?  It was just like just the president's here.  Like anything else, you could have fucking came out.  And nobody else would have cared about anything.  So I was supposed to introduce him, me and my partner introduced him, and then exit left. 
[00:52:00]  We introduced him, and we exit right, right into him as he's walking out.  And we do that thing where you got like a shuffle, like you only got to like shuffle.  And he's like being like real nice, and all he gives is a pat on his shoulder.  And all I kept thinking in my head was, what an enormous fucking skull this man has.  I just, like I couldn't, it didn't even seem like a person to me with all this shit around it.  His head just looked like a fucking refrigerator.  And I'm like, I come off, the Secret Service, because we had exited the wrong way, jumped into our shit, and like, you would have fucking been killed for, don't you ever fucking, you know? 
[00:52:30]  And I'm like, dude, I didn't fucking ask to be here, you guys ask me.  Right.  And they're like, all right, okay, you didn't mean, all right, come over here.  Then they start re-fucking yelling, like, don't ever, next time, and I go, there ain't gonna be a fucking next time.  Right.  And I'm not traveling with this man.  I fucking turned right instead of left.  Let me out of a fucking, just let me out of a fucking, well, what were you, are you serious? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, they were fucking crazy with us.  Holy shit.  They wanted to fucking kill us.  So you didn't get a photo with the president?  No.  I don't get a photo with anybody.  I know you like to do that.  I do, you don't do it?  No.  Don't you regret not getting one with the president?  No.  Wow.  Oh, you know what?  A bunch of people took pictures.  That's right, I have them somewhere, I don't know where they are, because the people from  the stage took them and sent them to me, and you see us fucking stopped in front of him  and blocking his way.  And we're both shoulder to shoulder, so he can't get around us. 
[00:53:30]  I want to see that.  I didn't fucking think of that.  But I'm also, you see me standing in front of that fucking seal, like you have that little  podium with the seal on it.  And here's the weird thing, they only put the seal up when he arrives.  Oh, okay.  You don't have it there all day.  It's like a guy whose job is to stay like 20 feet in front of him with a seal.  Right.  And get it on the podium just in time.  I've seen the motorcade go by for Bush.  Yeah, Bush Jr.  I've seen.  Bush Jr.  And Obama.  And you're right.  It's like an electric storm, man.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  It is something to see.  Especially when the first cars start coming, and then they just keep coming and coming,  and vans, and an ambulance, and motorcycle cops.  It's just unbelievable.  Wherever you see them, they already have a way to the hospital.  Oh, God.  Yeah, yeah.  They've got it all figured out.  That happens all day long.  Like, they know where the clearest hospital is.  And there's guys that are in every tree down the road, you know.  And it isn't just one hospital.  They have their way to fight.  There was actually people in trees that day, and because we're down in Florida, there was 
[00:54:30]  frogmen in water.  Really?  There were people in boats, and then guys just in water.  Really?  Like, what the fuck is this?  That's unbelievable.  What does this cost?  Well, that's a good question, because when we saw Obama at The View, not actually on the  show, but going to The View, me and Jimmy stood on the corner like idiots.  Yeah, right by our house.  Like idiots for an hour and a half.  Did you wave?  Like, hey.  We could barely see him.  And then I snuck around and figured out a better vantage point when he left, so I  got to see the whole motorcade come, you know, literally five feet in front of me. 
[00:55:00]  But they bring in the dump trucks now, Ronnie.  Yes, so you can't suicide climb on them.  So you can't even barrel through.  The big sanitation trucks?  Filled up with sand.  Filled up with sand.  They block everything with those now, too.  So you can't just barrel a car into the motorcade.  It's a smart move.  I mean, every time they cross a cross street, there's fucking two, one on each side.  There were sanitation trucks everywhere.  Now, what do you think that does to the psychology of the guy with that job?  That's got to fuck you up. 
[00:55:30]  Has to.  Has to.  You've got to be crazy.  And at another point, they always say gigantic depression hits when you stop being president.  Sure.  When you stop being president, it just feels like, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.  Right, sure.  I mean.  Especially if you lose an election.  If you go eight years, you know, like, the Constitution said, I can't do it anymore.  They did a documentary on the White House.  And I thought, stupid me, that the president walked around most of the White House by himself  if he wanted to.  Hell fucking no is right. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  He's being shadowed the entire time in the White House.  Maybe in the residence quarters, but it seems like they're even inside that, but kind of  near the door.  When you're the president, you're not in charge of your own body.  Of course.  Around those guys.  So when Reagan was shot, they treated him like a fucking rag doll.  It was just, they were showing some doc with it the other night, where they had just started  fucking manhandling him to find out where he was shot.  Not asking him.  And then ripped all of his clothes off in the back of the thing.  So he came out buck-ass naked when he was at the hospital. 
[00:56:30]  Huh.  They literally drug him out by his balls.  They were holding him up to his balls.  They said this one.  We are crazy.  I mean, seriously, as human beings, I just honestly think that we're crazy fucking men.  Well, they lost one after Kennedy, and they almost lost Gerald Ford, because two women  took shots at him.  I mean, Squeaky Fromm, and there's another one.  And like within a week.  But one of them was on an unscheduled, whatever they call an unscheduled stop.  He was supposed to go, and Gerald Ford wanted to walk, and they never want you to do that. 
[00:57:00]  Right.  And God damn it, there was a woman with a fucking pistol hoping he came that way, and she tried  to fucking shoot him.  I mean, it's like the Secret Service sounds like they're being overly protective, but  it's like, there really are a lot of people that want to kill the sitting president, so  they have to be fucking crazy.  After JFK got shot, that's a humiliation.  For the whole country, it's humiliated.  It's embarrassing.  But Ronnie introduced Bush.  Damn.  That is a very good one.  Yeah, that is a nice one, and I'm glad I fucked it up like that, and I'm like, you know, 
[00:57:30]  because then you got that story.  I introduced the band Bush once, so.  How was that?  We're pretty similar.  Pretty similar.  Yeah.  But my most famous beat is probably Anthony Anderson was at the Comedy Cellar one night,  the actor.  And I got him.  I don't know.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  That's good.  You guys still break?  Yeah.  Still do that this time?  I have to eat my eggy-wags.  Just so we can eat stuff.  You need anything, Ronnie?  No.  You can't go without eating.  Seriously, I feel like. 
[00:58:00]  Coffee?  What's your poison these days?  Eggs?  No poison.  No poison whatsoever.  Well, it could be a scone.  How is Feds?  Feds is so good.  I mean, he's really back on it.  Is he good?  He's really back on it.  No.  Oh.  He'll never be the same.  You know this.  I didn't know.  No.  It's like asking, like, when someone gets Alzheimer's, are they going to get better?  And you can act like.  And you have hope.  Oh, they looked.  I think he recognized me.  But no.  No.  Oh, my God.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  We got Ronnie in the house today.  I don't know.  We'll figure some other shit out after this.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The Virus.  Follow The Opie and Anthony Show online.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Opie Radio.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, man.  I'm really happy.  Ronnie is here from Ron and Fez.  And, man, is he saving us. 
[00:59:00]  Because Jimmy is in some kind of thorough flu buzz.  No, no.  I don't feel buzzed.  I just feel tired because I didn't sleep.  But thorough flu doesn't buzz me.  It just fucking knocks out your cough.  Well, you're waking up, though.  When we first started, there was a slowness.  I haven't slept.  This is like I'm just lubing because my sleep isn't so bad lately.  Yeah.  I'm very fucking tired.  Oh, Bush, because of Ronnie.  See what E-Rock does?  Yeah, it was nice.  It's a theme show.  Isn't it amazing?  It's a theme show.  And people put all that together out there and go, wow, this is just an amazing radio show. 
[00:59:30]  They're on it.  Yeah, they are on it.  They're on it.  If you haven't thought, suddenly the music will come up.  That's the great thing about it.  But I'm just glad here, you know, when I heard Ant was in the hospital.  I was just like, I've got to be here for my guys.  Absolutely.  This is the time we come together in this business.  I mean, this is the only business that loves and cares about each other.  Really?  And now, where is he right now?  He's on a cruise.  And he only tweets once a day. 
[01:00:00]  Yesterday, it was monkeys.  He's hanging out with monkeys.  Yeah, exactly.  Ring the bell.  Ring the bell.  But he's doing a lot of stuff that I didn't think he would do.  He swam with dolphins.  He was doing his gambling.  He said he raped the casino.  He swam with Larry Zonka.  Can you imagine?  There should be a thing where Mercury Morris is down there for 50 bucks.  You can take a lap with him.  Where is he at?  Where is he at?  Hold on.  As funny as that is, tell me that it's not a possibility down the road. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know why they don't do it.  Tell me it's not a possibility.  Well, you know what's really funny?  I don't know whether you guys ever hung out in Miami long, but all the guys from that  undefeated team never moved away, and they still do gigs.  So you can come to Radio Shack and meet the pulling guard for the 72 Dolphins.  None of them have ever left.  And every day, you turn on the radio, and they're on somewhere.  At that time, I thought we had a chance.  We were 13-0, and we were going into D.C. 
[01:01:00]  And you're like, really?  You're still fucking talking about this season?  It's kind of like going to that local bar and seeing the high school quarterback still  fucking live in the moment.  Yes, it is.  But, I mean, these guys had an actual real moment.  But you're right.  It's at a time that you peaked.  Speaking of which, when's Sinbad coming in?  8.30.  8.30.  Do you have any stories about Sinbad?  No, but Sinbad is kind of the 80s.  Sure he is.  The 80s comic.  I wanted to talk to him.  Jimmy was very excited to talk to Sinbad. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Me, not so much.  But we'll see how it goes.  That'll be fine.  I will tell you this.  He was never one of my favorites.  He obviously was very successful.  He was a good stand-up.  I mean, he was kind of family-friendly.  But when you watch some of his stuff, you're like, oh yeah, he really was a funny dude.  Let me tell you something.  This is a fucking true story.  In the 80s, I went into a comedy club in Florida.  Sinbad was on stage.  To this day, I've never saw a comic kill as he did.  Wow.  I mean, the audience was going fucking crazy where people were running out of their seats. 
[01:02:00]  One guy dove on the floor and acted like he was swimming.  I mean, people just were running up the wall and across the top of the ceiling.  And I think it was like still in the early days of, hey, a black guy's in here and he's nice.  And we feel like there was some kind of perfect storm that came together for him in the 80s.  But people were fucking crazy.  And I think he's the comic who invented the line, ladies love to go shopping, which kind 
[01:02:30]  of all the black comics have picked up.  But I believe he was the first who brought up the fact that women shop.  And after that, no black comic has let go of that premise.  You know, like, we'll be doing this.  They be shopping.  You know, when we go to a football game, they be shopping.  They be shopping.  You know, you sleep in, she's shopping.  You know, and they love that bit.  But I honest, you know, to me, I always like when anyone is the breakthrough guy, I think  that's his.  I think he came up with that. 
[01:03:00]  He had a funny, I don't remember what the line was.  It was something about how men get hair implants too quickly or transplants.  Fuck, I don't remember what the line was.  It was something about how, no, no, no, no.  Because the joke was, he just said something about like how men get hair transplants and  they think nobody notices.  Yeah.  Now, if you're bald-headed on Wednesday, do you know that joke I'm talking about?  No.  It was very funny.  It's never so much the material, but like he is such a likable guy that people are like, 
[01:03:30]  he's fine.  He didn't hurt anybody.  You know, his stuff was safe.  Yeah, I guess.  But it's not.  You could turn him on TV and no one's going to be, you know, hurt.  And he was funny.  So you find yourself like going like, I'm not going to laugh.  And then you're like, yeah, well, he really is a fucking good comic.  Like he was a great, he was a good comic.  I don't even know if he was good now.  Yeah.  Now that's something else I'm going to check out later today.  He hosted the Apollo.  Whatever happened to him?  Because then he just went away.  I don't know.  Will he talk about it?  Didn't he?  He ran into some money problems because he was on The Apprentice. 
[01:04:00]  I didn't even know he was on The Apprentice.  Yeah, like a couple of years ago when they did.  It wasn't even Celebrity Apprentice.  It was just the regular.  Really?  He said, I need a gig.  But I also remember that he used to do these funk shows, remember?  Sure.  So it would be him and funk bands.  Okay.  And they would, I think, be in the Bahamas.  Because we're tying this all together.  Maybe he was trying to stretch himself a little too thin and it fell apart on him.  But it's on a cruise.  He's two weeks.  And people are making fun of him. 
[01:04:30]  He's got the big, huge suite above the guy that's driving the boat.  He's got that spot.  So he's looking out the front of the boat.  Yes.  Yeah.  From his own balcony.  No one's bothering him.  Yeah.  He's classy.  He's got a fucking shirt with anchors on it.  For sure.  Miller Lite.  There he is.  Hey, uh.  Did you see him working at McDonald's?  That's a bad clip.  Man, just go ahead and cook some burgers.  Don't go out.  You walking back down with them little kids to be confused.  They got pictures of food on the cash register.  They don't have any more money, pictures of food. 
[01:05:00]  They still got to be trained.  I have some fries.  What's he wearing?  What is that?  I just got here last week.  Is that Chaps?  He's kind of rocking a kid and play here, which is great.  Yeah.  Well, it just shows that it's the 80s, right?  Yeah.  That might be the problem.  You ever, um.  Ronnie obviously ran the comedy club in Florida for a while.  And, uh, we're going to have the Bill Hicks guys on tomorrow.  Oh, those guys are great.  I did something at the, at the Friars Club, uh, when the movie first came out. 
[01:05:30]  You saw the movie?  With them.  Yeah.  I saw it.  What did you think?  Uh, I liked it very much.  I liked it very much too.  And, and, and what makes that strange is they don't really have any video of Bill Hicks,  uh, off the stage, but they made it work with pictures.  Yeah.  And a lot of the, the friends that were there, he was, he was kind of a man out of the time,  right?  Absolutely.  But you listen to his stuff now.  It makes sense today.  His, his comedy's not dated.  Bill Hicks.  No, no, no.  It was amazingly. 
[01:06:00]  And again, dude, you know, he also didn't play the audience.  I, I, I was saying this when I had to do this panel with them is like, I thought the,  the interesting thing about Bill Hicks is that he was a Southern guy saying these things  that he said, he didn't play to the audience.  He was like, look, not only am I here to make you laugh, but I'm trying to wake you up  a little bit.  Uh, but I did this panel.  Not easy to do, by the way.  And, uh, Bert Lahr's son writes for the New Yorker and he was the cowardly lion.  Sure.  Bert Lahr. 
[01:06:30]  That's great.  And this guy, I think his name is John Lahr and he's a great writer and he looks just  like Bert Lahr.  Really?  So I couldn't, like we're supposed to like, and they would say, what do you think about Hicks?  And I would just be looking at Bert Lahr the whole time on King of the Forest.  Um, but have you seen this doc yet, Jimmy?  I have literally never watched anything more than a minute on Hicks.  I don't know any of this stuff and I've heard he's great.  I've heard nothing but good stuff from comedians.  Love him. 
[01:07:00]  But it's like at this point, I just don't want to see another comic and become influenced  by like, I don't want to pick up something from Hicks and not like, and not realize it.  Yeah.  Cause I see too many guys I know have been influenced by him and I just, I just don't  want to know.  I heard he's great and I just, I don't want to know.  It might sound ignorant, but I have the guys I love and I just don't want to fucking watch  another guy.  But this I'll watch.  But man, I mean, still pictures.  This movie is a lot of still pictures.  And then when they go to the real people at the end, I was kind of bummed cause they  really made those pictures move, right? 
[01:07:30]  Right.  They got some technology going on, some way past Ken Burns shit at this point.  You know, I just saw another doc the other night of this.  It was like back in the seventies and they tried to teach a monkey to talk.  I don't know if you remember that thing.  It was called Project Nim and it was these guys at Columbia and they had a monkey and  they would teach them sign language.  Yeah.  But because it was seventies, they were also smoking dope with them.  Everything was so off the fucking rails in this country. 
[01:08:00]  I don't, I swear to God, I would probably pick five documentaries before I would see  any movie these days.  I'm a big documentary fan.  They're so fucking funny of just how stupid we are.  What happened to the monkey when they were all smoking dope?  I am telling you, like they made so many mistakes with this monkey and I don't want to  give it away from people, but he ends up, they're going to do fucking medical experiments.  Like they literally threw the monkey away after teaching them a language.  So they're going to do stuff.  And now he's fucking hand signaling. 
[01:08:30]  Help me.  It's like you're killing a five year old because suddenly they're like, well, the only thing  we know how to fight AIDS with is monkey juice.  I don't know what happened there for a while, but, uh, in the eighties, everything came about  like monkey AIDS.  So, but it was fucking, what's the name of this thing?  I think it's called project NIMH project NIMH project NIMH project NIMH.  Fuck Ronnie's giving me a whole bunch of shit.  I got to check out.  Well, it's the same guy who won the Oscar for man on a wire.  Did you ever see that one?  Man on a wire.  Yeah.  Same director.  Oh yeah.  He had all pictures. 
[01:09:00]  He had no, uh, no video.  And he says it.  Remember we interviewed him.  He, yeah.  Philippe, uh, Philippe, uh, very, very full of himself.  Yeah.  Remember that Jimmy?  Is that right?  He was an absolute ass as I might've been if I had the balls.  If you have balls enough to do that and to lay down and look up.  The one shot of him laying down in between the towers and that wire.  With his foot hanging off.  One of the most chilling things I've ever seen.  That's even scarier than, uh, Alan, Elaine Robert.  You ever see him?  He's the guy who climbs buildings.  Oh yeah.  It's like a Spider-Man deal.  But he uses no equipment. 
[01:09:30]  Just his hands.  Just his hands and powder.  But he climbed the fucking.  That's not as, uh, uh, scary as, uh, him laying down on the wire.  I agree.  I think the wire is scarier.  He just lays down in the middle to check out the view.  And he said there was a bird above him.  Yeah.  It just, like, it, I can't comprehend that.  I so wish they had video of that.  They don't, they have video from the street a little bit, right?  If I remember correctly from the documentary?  I don't know.  Do they?  But most of that movie's, uh, still shots.  But just how, what they went through to get that done.  Well, what do you think the exact height is before it starts to kick in for you that 
[01:10:00]  it's too high?  There's gotta be, like, a measurement.  Like, eight feet, you're like, whatever.  But it starts to get, like, nine and a half feet, ten feet, twelve feet.  That's not bad either, even though it'll probably kill you anyway.  Right.  But I don't know.  I mean, at a certain point where you say, I would not walk across, let's say, the pipe.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, remember when you used to walk across pipes?  Oh, sure.  When you were kids?  Oh, um, then it would have to be right around twenty feet.  Ten, twelve feet, because you'd break your leg.  Ten or twelve?  Yeah, because you'd break your ankle. 
[01:10:30]  You wouldn't die, but you'd break your ankle.  You're fucking mean.  But that real fear kicks in, I think, twenty feet.  I get vertigo after a certain height.  I'm completely inconsolable.  And it all starts to spin on you?  It makes me, me and Kenny walked across the Golden Gate Bridge when I was in San Francisco.  Yeah.  And if I stop and would look up at the structure on the bridge, I'd get like, oh, I gotta touch  something.  Like, a look up fucking horrifies me.  You can't look over the edge?  I did.  I made myself.  I got comfortable. 
[01:11:00]  Have you done the Brooklyn Bridge walk when you go back and forth?  To Brooklyn?  No.  It's great.  Because there's like a grate.  So you're walking over and can look right down and see the river.  It's great.  And I can't believe like most people like just do that to go back and forth to work.  I know.  Because it seems like, to me, like a daredevil tree.  You're scared.  No, I'm not crazy about them, but I get more of a thing of, what happened if I shoved someone  or jumped off here?  You know what I mean?  Like, I think if you've got a good imagination, it starts to fucking kick in.  Yeah, I think that happens to most of us.  I really do. 
[01:11:30]  When you think I'll just...  You get the feeling of maybe I'll just jump and you go, oh my God, can I even trust myself  enough to be standing on this ledge still?  Or like...  So then you back away.  Like, if I grab these two guys in a headlock and jump, it's fucking weird with that look.  You know, because I get in the back of some...  Like, I can actually picture people explaining it later.  Like, yeah, he just grabbed the baby from that lady and he jumped.  He was fucking laughing crazy, swinging the baby over his head.  How are you with like glass floors?  You ever done one of those?  I don't even know if I've ever run into a... 
[01:12:00]  There's one in Toronto, CNTel.  And then the guys turn us on to their glass boxes in Chicago.  And you walk right out into the glass box.  I did that.  Oh, you did that?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The Sears Tower.  The Sears Tower.  Oh, they just added that box.  Yes, they did.  Yeah, and that looks like...  You know, it looks like Mars just built it himself.  It was not part of the original building.  No, no, no.  It's a head-on.  And it just added, like fucking people do that live in trailer parks and call it like,  oh, this is our back deck. 
[01:12:30]  No, it's not.  Yeah.  The one in Toronto, you walk across a glass floor and it drops down easily a thousand feet,  whatever it is.  And I don't know what it is.  You're obviously safe, but you want to get to the other side.  You want to tiptoe.  Your mind just plays tricks.  The one in the Sears Tower was scary.  I'm trying to find a photo.  I have photos from it.  It's very scary.  Why is it scary?  You're totally safe in there.  Yeah, but you're standing out there on glass.  And when you look left, you see other people in the next box.  And when you look down, it's like you're 1,100 feet in the air. 
[01:13:00]  It's just fucking horrendous.  Very scary.  It's a terrible idea.  Yeah, it really is.  It's a terrible idea.  You think?  Yeah, but have you been to the Grand Canyon?  I want to do that.  You don't have any...  I'd be scared, but...  You don't have any fear at the Grand Canyon because it's too high.  True.  So you go out to the Grand Canyon, you just look down, you're like, ah, you're like fucking  around like you fall because you don't even imagine that it's real.  Did you walk out on the glass thing?  I don't even know where the glass thing is there.  The Grand Canyon is pretty big.  Did you hike it? 
[01:13:30]  No.  What am I going to go down in the middle of that?  We went all the way down.  No.  My brother...  That was my brother's idea, though.  I wasn't all in, but it was something he wanted to do.  Because it takes a long time, right?  Yeah, and there's signs everywhere.  Don't hike to the river and back in one day.  And in the bookshop, it's a huge thick book, all the deaths at the Grand Canyon.  They really sell it.  Don't do this.  And my brother was obsessed.  He's like, we're going.  And we did it.  Was it worth it or was it like...  I have a story to tell now.  We hiked out at 10, 30, 11 o'clock at night. 
[01:14:00]  You don't know what the fuck's on the trail when the sun goes down.  It was creepy as a while.  So you were just bitching up a storm coming back to it?  I was hurting.  Oh, that's stupid.  That's the high.  I'm showing him the picture I showed you up.  That's stupid.  Sitting in the glass box.  You wouldn't do that just for the...  No.  I can fucking Photoshop it.  It's very fucking high.  Yeah.  But you do really think of falling.  But being in the middle of the Grand Canyon as the sun's going down with no one around,  holy shit.  That's a moment.  That's a moment. 
[01:14:30]  We had a blast.  I was dehydrated when I...  Yeah, I don't know if I'd do that.  Why?  Too much exercise.  Just walking and fucking feet hurt and shit.  It was dirty.  We were pretty fucking tired.  Fucking mules.  And then our...  Did you have a mule with you?  No, we just...  I gotta have a mule.  My brother...  And then my brother...  My brother takes off because he saw the river was in sight.  And he said, fuck you, old man.  He's six years younger than me.  And he went and left me right the fuck behind.  So...  But we're having the Bill Hicks guys in tomorrow for that documentary. 
[01:15:00]  Okay.  I don't know.  The movie's not for everyone, obviously, Ronnie, right?  No.  It's not for me.  Gotta be a comedy fan.  Did you ever have Bill at your club?  Yeah.  I had...  I actually worked a week with Bill a long, long time ago when I was just kind of starting  out.  I middled for him and it was...  The weirdest thing is, and I know, Jimmy, you can relate to this, is like I did better  than him because I was doing this really prepared set, you know?  And then he went up there and was kind of tubing as he was experimenting in front of 
[01:15:30]  people.  But like every joke he did was like a kick in my stomach.  Like, oh God, that's real.  Oh God, now my fucking shit.  You know?  So like I was all...  And we were playing just some shitty fucking thing and people were coming up later and  going, you're so much funnier.  And I'm like, shut up.  I'm fucking going home and I'm changing everything.  I worked a year on something that's stupid just because you fucking assholes are laughing  at it doesn't mean shit to me. 
[01:16:00]  When they say like, you should have been the headliner and you're like, you don't understand  how funny the guy was that you just saw.  Right.  Yeah.  Believe me, I've had that where I've...  Because you look at the thing you do.  In the middle is a cake spot.  Right.  You don't have to warm them up and you don't have the pressure closing.  So you go up there and fucking bang it out for 25 minutes and you know what you  did.  You know what I mean?  It's like some of the material is good.  Some of it's primitive.  Right.  And then a real act is on stage after you and not doing as well and you almost feel embarrassed  that you killed in front of them.  Yeah.  And it was really just that thing of like, he was fucking walking the tightrope and I 
[01:16:30]  was like, do you ever notice when you're smoking pot?  You know?  And they're like, yeah!  Fuck!  We have smoked pot!  This is great!  And they're like, what's that thing?  You know, you're just fucking one after another and you're just doing really well and you've  been working like a while to get to it and you felt like, fuck yeah, now I got it.  And you're like, he's up there and he's just fucking, I'm just watching his mind go from  one place to the other.  And it was just kind of, ah, all right, fuck, stupid, yeah, lazy, fucking lazy. 
[01:17:00]  But like, then I got to, you know, we just stayed in the same condo.  So I talked to him all week and we hung out and he was really a fucking brilliant guy.  I mean, he was really, and we get, you know, we get to know all the funny fucking brilliant  guys that there is.  But he was a really brilliant guy.  And, uh, the fucking weirdest thing is, is like, would, you know, just by staying alive, 
[01:17:30]  I don't know if you'd be a lot better.  You know what I mean?  Like, I don't know whether that was, you know, peak or what, you know, like, I don't know  if, if Carlin would have died in the seventies, would he still be Carlin?  You know, the people probably, you know, I mean, you know, you add more stuff, but I don't  know whether it would have been, you know, more and more new or whatever.  But you wonder what kind of metamorphosis, because Carlin went through metamorphosis,  like, uh, he changed a lot of what he was doing.  He became angrier as he got older. 
[01:18:00]  And I liked his later stuff better.  The very end of it, he hated the human race so much.  It was just so fucking interesting.  I say so fucking awesome.  I agree.  I thought it was amazing that he just called out everybody.  You are all diseased.  Creating right to the fucking end.  His last one was sad, I thought, because he looked like he was slowing down.  The one he did in front of the tombstone, did you ever see that one?  No.  He had had some heart trouble that year.  He had put some weight on.  Um, wasn't his best work, but I think because that was health. 
[01:18:30]  You are all diseased was just, I think his wife had passed away and he was unloading on  people accurately.  Oh, it was great.  I loved him angry.  Why did you stop doing stand-up, Rye?  I don't think I ever asked you that.  Um, you know, for me, at the time, because I had like a big radio show and I was just  staying in that area, it just got to be the same thing.  Too much.  And I would go out and everybody was like, eh.  And then, you know, I didn't challenge myself, so I just fucking went off of it. 
[01:19:00]  But I don't see a big difference from what I did on stage than what I do here.  You know, because I wasn't doing a lot of prepared material.  I was just going out.  Do you miss the interaction of the audience, though?  No, not at all.  Really?  Not even slightly.  Would you ever go back to it?  I don't think they add.  I think I could go back to it, yeah.  Of course you could.  But I don't know.  I couldn't do what Jimmy does where, oh, I'm up late and then I'm traveling and I'm  coming back.  I just, the traveling thing is just something like, you know, I want to travel for fun,  not for cakes.  Well, would you do it locally? 
[01:19:30]  Um, I don't even know if I, I mean, what would be the difference?  What would be the addition?  You know?  That's a good question.  It's a different animal.  To the degree of, like, what I like about it is the immediacy of knowing how funny it  is.  Getting the reaction right away.  The immediacy, yeah.  What sucks about radio, we don't know.  We don't even know if this is happening right now.  I absolutely do know.  That's the fucking, seriously, I fucking know.  I'm like, I know I'm off on a bad tangent.  I'm going to stop and I'm going to get on a good tangent.  Oh yeah, well, you know, some of that shit.  But I don't, uh, I don't know if I even want to just be funny all the time. 
[01:20:00]  I think what I like about doing radio is that you just don't have to, hey, they paid money,  so I got to give them something, you know?  I'd rather sit down and just fucking talk about something.  And mix it up.  Get serious.  You can meander, as they say.  Yeah, yeah.  The, um, it's a, it's a, but, you know, when I see what Charlie Sheen is doing now  and some of his work, I'm like, yeah, it's still.  Well, do you know what's fun about live stand-up is like, because on the radio, again, even  when you, you don't know exactly how they're feeling, there's no pushback, but I like what 
[01:20:30]  I'm doing stand-up.  If, if I'm talking about a subject where I know I'm cutting off their exits, like,  I know how audiences are and they want to disagree and they want to, ah, but almost  like I know what I'm, where I'm going to go and I like fucking setting it up so  they can't back out and groan at me or fucking walk away.  I like kind of pinning them into where they have to laugh at it because they feel hypocritical  if they don't.  What do you like doing better?  You're the, you're the guy doing it, doing both.  I love for different reasons.  Radio is amazing because we can just sit here and talk. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  But stand-up is very, it's a very powerful feeling.  Yeah.  You think in the last five years your stand-up has changed a lot though?  Do you feel like you're still making the kind of changes that you did when you were  younger or?  Yeah, more so, I think.  Yeah.  Because I've gotten less, because I have my own fan base and people will come, I'm  less worried about winning them over.  Like, I know I have to be funny.  I don't mail it in, but I know I have enough confidence to go, I'm a funny guy, I'm a good  comedian, so even when I'm missing, I can kind of relax and find where I want to go with 
[01:21:30]  it.  I'm much more comfortable exploring now.  But I don't do it as much as I did a few years ago because the schedule is grueling.  I mean, I always used to do seven sets on a weekend.  I would do four on Saturday.  I know I held my hand up.  Four and three Friday.  But you're also, you know, touring a lot more than you used to, right?  I mean, you're constantly in a plane.  Yeah, headline gigs, yeah.  Because of the money.  It's great to go out and make the cash.  I just think that that's so rough, though, man.  When I see you doing it, like, you're working here and then go and do a weekend across the 
[01:22:00]  country and then be back here.  Wow.  Yeah, I don't know how he does it.  This is brutal.  I really don't know how he does it.  I like having this to come back to, though.  It's a corny, but it's like coming back to my regular, this is my regular gig.  I love this gig.  I really do.  And I love coming back to it.  I love knowing it's here.  What Ronnie's saying, I mean, you'll leave on a Thursday to L.A. or Irvine was the last  one, I guess, and then you're back here on Monday.  I can't even imagine that.  I love it.  I love being busy.  Because all the guys that aren't, man, all the guys that don't do radio that just dropped  out, man, those guys that didn't want to, you know, the guys that just wanted to take 
[01:22:30]  off on New Year's Eve and hang out with their friends and stuff like that, they're miserable  now.  They're like, well, how do you get on TV?  How do you get on TV?  I didn't do it.  Because they didn't do the work, man.  They're miserable.  You mentioned Charlie Sheen in there.  Does that remind you of the old road shows?  Oh, God.  I'm looking at Charlie Sheen, and I'm getting reports here and there, and I'm like, this  is an O&A road show.  It's a Ron and Fez road show where you just, although you guys organize them way better than 
[01:23:00]  we ever did, but where you just go up there and make it up as you go and hope something  sticks.  That's what he's doing, Charlie Sheen.  He's doing a typical radio road show in front of everybody.  He's even having the girls kiss.  Remember when there was a lull in the fucking road shows?  You go, let's just find some broads to kiss on stage.  That'll help this.  How many more is he going to do, though?  He said it's 20 altogether.  He was in Cleveland last night.  I think Travis, I don't know if he's around, or close, I should say, he got a standing 
[01:23:30]  ovation, but supposedly...  So it's getting better and better.  No, he had a Cleveland Indians jersey on.  Oh, smart idea.  And then came out and said, I'm filming Major League Three in Cleveland.  So how does the audience turn on you at that point?  Oh, he was the smart...  Here's what he did.  He went up and said, that's the equivalent of give yourselves a hand for coming out.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking...  We all know the tricks.  Yeah.  If you need to, you pull one of those tricks out of your back pocket.  Fuck yeah.  But you know what?  He's not a stand-up.  He's surviving.  He's getting better with every gig.  So you know what? 
[01:24:00]  You know, fuck it.  What do you think?  We argue this point all the time when we're seeing these video clips of Charlie.  We're saying he's more manic.  And I think I did hear you say that on your show.  And who was saying...  You know, Jay Moore was saying, no way he looks fucking high as a kite.  Well, a lot of times when you come off drugs, you're like that, though.  A lot of times, most people who become addicted, you know, it's kind of a self-medicating thing.  You know, so he knows.  He knows his fucking mind is crazy. 
[01:24:30]  I mean, when you see the way that he talks and what he's doing, would you like to be that way all the time?  You know, I mean, it's fucking rough.  It's just rough to have your thoughts spinning around like that in your head.  And, you know, I fucking feel for the guy.  But you think he's clean.  It's just more of the manic thing, right?  Yeah, but I think his manic thing is like anyone else doing meth.  I think it's like if you were on a fucking eight-day meth run.  I think that's just the way his brain is.  But he could have fucked up, you know, his entire system through the, you know, through the partying that he was doing. 
[01:25:00]  I think he also caught this fucking lightning.  Hey, this crazy thing.  All of a sudden, people are...  That guy is terrible.  People are loving it.  That one hurt, huh, Jimmy?  Oh, it did it.  It's dry in my throat.  And then he kind of had to crazy it up.  Right.  Fuck me.  No, it's not good.  All right, drink some water.  Some water.  We're going to lose him.  He's also playing up to what people think he is, too, right?  He's William Shatner. 
[01:25:30]  Now, Shatner took like fucking 20 years to be like, oh, wait, they're laughing at me?  Right, right.  Let me get it.  Like, he did it immediately.  Right.  A fucking immediately.  I agree.  But then the stupid news, they're like, oh, look how crazy he is.  It's like, no, now he's playing up to the fact that you want to see crazy Charlie.  Did you see, speaking of crazy, Meatloaf?  Yeah.  The Apprentice Meltdown?  Did you think that that was even real either?  Fuck yeah, because we talked to Meatloaf.  Yeah.  He's nuts.  Meat's angry. 
[01:26:00]  Did you see the documentary of Meatloaf on tour?  I'm going to turn you...  Believe it or not, I didn't say it.  No, I didn't say it.  I'm going to turn you on to that.  I'm going to see the Meatloaf on tour documentary.  You have to see it because he's a hypochondriac and he has all these people around trying to  get them together to go on stage.  You know, they say whatever age you become a star at, you stay that age mentally.  You don't fucking expand.  And that's why, like, the worst thing that can happen is, like, be a Danny Bonaduce.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Where it happens, like, when you're 11. 
[01:26:30]  Then you don't grow out of it.  But if it happens, like, when you're 21, 22, what you want is a nice, slow climb.  Uh-huh.  And then you're fucking mature and you've got all this work behind you.  That's all right.  You've got to see the Meatloaf thing.  I'm telling you right now.  I worry about them.  Do you?  Yeah, I worry about meat.  Can we see this, Danny?  No.  You've seen this yet, Jimmy?  It gets mad.  You do not want to f*** with me!  Oh, you've got to do the E.  I am Ashlyn Gorse for News Now.  Oh, fuck.  These new girls love to rip her hair out. 
[01:27:00]  You're missing stuff.  Yeah.  You sure all, and then all that is actually Gary's?  No.  Gary, did you buy this paint right here?  Yeah.  But Meatloaf doesn't believe him.  I bought those motherf***ing sponges.  Part of that paint is mine.  I'm f***ing sick and tired of it.  F*** you!  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That was all mine in my basket.  You look in my eyes.  I am the last person in the f***ing world you ever f***ing want to f*** with! 
[01:27:30]  Is this too real, Ronnie?  He eventually finds his stash elsewhere, leading to an emotional hug-it-out session between the deeps.  I mean, you wouldn't take that long to f***ing yell out those words.  You'd leap.  It reminds me of Fezzy.  When Fezzy loses his mind, he gets a little vicious.  But that's the thing.  It's like, no one thinks Fez is going to jump.  No.  It's more about, hey, watch how I'm acting.  Yeah.  Look what I'm doing.  I don't think Meatloaf jumps at you.  No.  I think it's all just a nice little-  I think he was very hot under the collar there, though. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, he was a little.  It's a lot longer than that, but-  He has a great f***ing Kennedy story, which I can't do justice, but he was in Dealey Plaza.  He was there when Kennedy came out of Love Field.  He has a great presidential story.  Is that right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Isn't that weird?  That's what we got at him.  See, we do a good interview every once in a while, Ronnie.  Every once in a while we get one.  Every once in a while we get one.  Everybody says, you guys f***ing just nail it one after another.  Just hit it out of the park.  Just f***ing top of the case shit.  Just f***ing blast.  Every once in a while we close our eyes and we'll hit it out of the park, you know. 
[01:28:30]  Ronnie is f***ing the greatest interviewer.  All of our interviews start like this.  So what's going on?  Yeah.  So what's up with you now?  Look at some of our stuff that we have here.  I'm going to bring in an intern.  Check him out.  All right.  Who's your favorite interview?  You've interviewed Kevorkian.  You've interviewed some f***ing great people, man.  Oh, f***.  I don't know if I have a favorite.  Was he that good one?  Kevorkian is just so strange.  Like, there was nothing. 
[01:29:00]  You know what I mean?  Like, Kevorkian and Jesse Ventura are the same type of thing.  You're not going to open up anything there.  They're just where they are.  Like, I think Kevorkian, even though I agree 100% with the message, he's f***ing nuts.  Really?  I mean, he dug f***ing killing people.  He got off on it.  Really?  He likes death.  Now, in the meantime, should you be able to f***ing help somebody on to the next plane?  Yeah, I got no problem with that.  You would do it for a friend.  Mm-hmm.  A f***ing heartbeat.  In a second. 
[01:29:30]  You brought up something.  You like getting something out of a person, a little something different, right?  I kind of just like...  Like a reveal?  No, no, no, no.  I never look for that kind of stuff.  Do you like when someone surprises you and really, really tells you some stuff?  Yeah.  Where you're opening them up a little bit?  I never go looking for that hot f***ing thing to put out, you know...  No, I understand that.  But, yeah, no, I just like them to...  I like them to...  Like, who surprised you?  Where you thought, all right, I think I could do a, you know, 20 minutes with this person, 
[01:30:00]  but then by the end of it, you were like, I was surprised how well that went.  Well, you know what?  I will say this, and Jimmy's done the Unmasked show with me.  I just don't think people get how bright comedians are.  Like, how f***ing smart comedians are.  Because it's...  I don't know if you can be funny without being f***ing smart.  Voss.  Well, he...  The destroyer of that theory.  You know, sometimes the exception makes the rule.  You know what I mean? 
[01:30:30]  Like, if you don't have a rule, too, you go, oh, see, there's the exception.  Yes, there's always going to be something.  But, no, I would love to actually do one of those with Voss, too.  Because I think it would be interesting at the end of it, but...  He's got...  Honestly, he's got great stories.  Voss is great.  I think he's absolutely...  You really should do it.  I've actually talked to him about it before.  But I think he's a f***ing...  One of the most interesting people that I've ever f***ing talked to.  And I met Voss back when he was, like, f***ing crazy. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, really?  Years and years and years ago when he was with Frankie Bastille.  And I'm trying to think who the other guy was.  But he...  All three of these f***ing guys were so f***ing scary drug heads.  Really?  Voss?  Scary?  Voss is the first person I ever heard the word crack from.  I had never...  This is how early it was that he was, like, saying, I want to get back for crack.  And I'm like, crack?  What the f*** are you talking...  You know, wasn't even in the papers yet. 
[01:31:30]  Really?  You know?  And then finally I'm like, oh, you mean Freebase?  And he's like, no, yeah, but they do it for you.  I'm like, who does?  Who's Frankie?  Who would f***ing buy...  I thought it was, like, the worst business plan ever.  Like, Freebase, it takes all day.  F*** it.  Let's just snort it.  But he had f***ing said, no, they do it for you.  It's crack.  I'm like, wow.  All right.  So he was...  And, like, even running with people that were, you know, f***ing way out there.  So for him to come back, I never would have... 
[01:32:00]  I never would have predicted it.  You didn't think he would have?  Yeah, no, I just thought...  I f***ing guy.  I love Voss.  He's one of my favorites, man.  Love him.  I love when he does the radio show.  I wish he was smarter.  And he's...  But, you know, here's the other thing about Voss, too.  How many years have we been doing it, like, relentlessly f***ing funny for decades?  Yeah.  And again, to me, that's always f***ing fascinating.  To just be, you know, whatever.  Big gig, smaller gig.  Boom, boom, boom.  You'll never say he doesn't bring it.  And he's pretty fearless. 
[01:32:30]  Like, he really will make fun of anybody.  And he really will hit anybody.  He hits below the belt.  Like, Voss is...  When you get...  Voss is dangerous when he's against the ropes.  Because he just hits...  He just claws anywhere.  And he can say some really funny below-the-belt shit.  He knows how to survive.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, you gotta cover up when he's around, because he's f***ing good.  Absolutely.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  Was this the story you tweeted about yesterday, Jimmy, the paraplegic grandfather?  I love him.  You love this story, huh?  Sure. 
[01:33:00]  All right, we're gonna get into that.  Maybe we'll do some news.  See what's going on out there.  And more with Ronnie B.  Stay there.  Good morning.  Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  My name is Danny.  How can I help you?  I used to have the thing on my TV where you can download shit from, you know, like, through,  you know, the air, satellite.  Like Wi-Fi?  Wi-Fi.  Whatever.  Here's the thing.  But, I mean, that's not working now, because...  This is Radio Shack.  Do you need, like, an AC adapter?  Maybe get somebody to come over and fix it.  Well, I mean, we really... 
[01:33:30]  This is Radio Shack, you know, so we don't really do that.  Oh.  We sell products.  Oh, I see.  Well, I mean, I'm not supposed to do this, but, like, I mean, did you get into your router  settings and take a look in there?  Okay, so it's right here.  So what are you saying?  Like, just look into your router settings.  Okay, so I log in.  I find this shit right here.  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  So get in there and then, you know, make sure that your Wi-Fi is enabled.  But where do you fucking wire it into?  Well, I mean, it should just be wired right from your cable modem.  It should just be right in there.  Yeah.  Why?  How do you know that?  Because that's just how it works. 
[01:34:00]  Are you talking about the hot, the heavy, thick wire you're talking about?  You mean, like a Cat5?  You're talking about a...  You know, Ethernet cable?  Yeah, they call them...  I think they call them hot wires.  Fire wires?  Fire wires.  Dude, do you need, like, a universal AC adapter or a soldering iron?  What's that?  Dude, I just...  Let me just get back to work, man.  Like, can you open a browser and get to the web?  So it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Yeah, yeah, it's wireless.  It's a wireless connection.  Are you on the web?  Okay, so now...  Can you go to a website?  Can you do that?  You hook it up, okay? 
[01:34:30]  Are you listening?  Are you listening to me?  Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Is it that easy?  Yes!  Click.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, I see it.  Bingo.  We have a winner.  Is that it?  Is that it for good?  Is that...  Am I set for life?  Yeah, yeah, that's it, dude.  Yeah, yeah, that's it.  Thank you for helping me with this.  Yeah, man, no problem, dude.  There were some other tech questions I needed.  Oh, oh, Facebook.  No, no, no, no.  No, no!  I'm up to my limit of friends.  No!  If you want a cordless phone or some LEDs, fine.  I'm up to my limit of friends.  Five, I'm not helping with Facebook. 
[01:35:00]  I think somebody sent a fan page.  I'm hanging up!  How do I get people to go there?  Instead of sending me friend requests.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show on the virus.  Sirius XM.  All right, we're doing this thing. 
[01:35:30]  Ronnie B came in today.  We asked him yesterday to do the radio show, and it was very, very, very just vague.  Yes, it was vague.  Ronnie's like, I would like to stop by.  We'll see what happens.  And then I just kept looking out the window, and then Ronnie appeared.  You know, I wasn't going to let you down.  I wasn't going to let you down.  But, and it's all because of that and what he's going through right now.  Yeah.  Seriously, everything to his family.  I was looking up here a couple minutes ago, and I noticed Travis was crying.  I'm like, oh, yeah, I keep forgetting.  You keep forgetting why you're here. 
[01:36:00]  Like, Sam was looking out the window, and I'm like, Sam, for some reason, just start calling his dad.  I'm like, just checking in with you, pal.  Well, by the way, when I come into Sam's show, and his dad is a real big fan of the chemistry that Sam and I have together.  Yeah, I heard.  Is he?  Yeah.  It could be Ronnie and Sam.  Well, it already is Ronnie and Sammy Sweethearts.  That's the name of the end of the show.  Yeah.  Well, you and Ron do, what, a 10-minute radio show every day now, too?  Right.  There's so many different radio shows now, I can't even keep track. 
[01:36:30]  I know.  It's kind of a podcast.  Yeah, it's like a podcast on radio.  It's how we're marketing it.  All of a sudden, I'm doing radio with E-Rock and Roland now.  I got a separate show, too.  When does that happen?  Before you come in, I do part of the 10 o'clock hour with Roland, E-Rock, and Sam, so now I guess that's our show.  So that's what I'm walking in, so you've got that part of it.  Then it's a blend over.  Oh, yeah.  It's a best of, and Sam's just dropping fucking truth bombs.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Sam gets about five minutes to do his thing, and then you come in to save the hour. 
[01:37:00]  I'm going to give you a bit right now that a friend of mine named Tim Tuttle gave me one time.  You could do this on a Saturday night.  He's a stand-up, right?  I don't know if he's a stand-up.  Or an actor?  He's a radio guy.  He might have done stand-up.  Everyone's blended.  You can't have just one job anymore.  But you could try this.  When you were a kid, you played guns with your friends, right?  Sure, yeah.  What's your machine gun?  How do you do your machine gun?  Oh, like this.  No, do the sound.  The one that you did with your friends. 
[01:37:30]  Pow, pow, pow.  You would go pow, pow, pow.  Yeah, I'm a pow, pow, pow guy.  Here's the thing.  It's like snowflakes.  You try this at a party.  No two people do the machine gun sound the same way.  What's Jimmy's?  You didn't ask Jimmy.  Jimmy has the best wand.  No, no, wait.  Probably more like Ron's.  Let's hear it.  He's so tired.  No, it's fucking strange, right?  It's not like you learn it from an older brother. 
[01:38:00]  You just make up your own machine gun sound.  You're doing E-Rock.  E-Rock, what is your machine gun sound?  Wow, we're doing a bit.  This is nice.  Of course.  I think that wasn't bad.  That is a...  That was pretty good.  Yeah.  I like beating up E-Rock, but I think he has the best wand of the day.  Now, you can also see his came in a short burst.  You know, it's there.  It's almost like an Uzi.  He goes, but he also runs out of breath quickly.  That's right.  You know?  This is the full metal jacket machine gun when they're shooting at the women and children. 
[01:38:30]  That's what that was.  Mine's based on cartoons.  I'm a cartoon guy.  Let's hear yours again.  Pow, pow, pow.  So yours is really...  It's not really a machine gun.  Yours is even less than a cartoon and more of a comic strip.  Yeah, yeah.  You have like a pow, pow, pow there.  Yeah, yeah.  But again, it's like none of your friends ever...  You weren't doing the same sounds.  No.  You weren't doing the sound as your older brother, but no one ever stopped doing it.  No, that's not how you're doing machine guns.  That's not a machine gun.  We accept each other's machine guns.  But we also didn't have a good point of reference.  Like, my point of reference for machine gun was Dick Tracy.  How old are you? 
[01:39:00]  Well, the movie.  The Warren Beatty movie.  Oh, okay.  I thought you were sitting around with Bear LaGuardia on the fucking radio.  With the bear reading the fucking concert.  Even though we're not getting the newspaper, kids, I'm going to read the funnies to you.  Right.  The city's falling apart.  He's reading fucking comics to us.  Now, Travis, I have a feeling that you were a stay-in-the-house guy.  Am I right about that?  You weren't big on being outside with the other kids?  No.  Well, my brother and I lived in a neighborhood where nobody else was.  Okay.  So, good to see how...  What does that mean?  I'm like, it's so you didn't go out much. 
[01:39:30]  It's not a neighborhood.  No, well, we didn't live with any other kids.  Yeah, what, like an old-age home or something?  No, just like a...  Now that I think about it, a not-too-great area of Florida.  What area are you doing?  We're in St. Pete.  Okay, so...  This was back in the 80s.  All right, so you grew up there.  You grew up in an elderly kind of...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so we didn't really have anything.  I went through the same thing.  I kind of grew up...  I grew up in a nudist camp.  So, my parents were like, don't go outside and play with the...  You know?  Because there was always, like, cocks, like, older men's cocks out there and stuff. 
[01:40:00]  It was very fucking difficult.  Dicks and stuff.  Right.  Sometimes assholes.  It was really...  Because they're bending down to pick up the volleyball.  Yeah, it was uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable for everyone.  And I'm, like, saying to my mom, like, I've got to make friends.  Like, not with Mr. Anderson.  It's fucking scary.  Balls, too?  Yeah, because the other...  There were balls, and they were fucking hairy.  Lots of balls.  Whatever.  But this is what you had to go through in those days.  Are we going to hear his gun running?  Travis, let's hear it. 
[01:40:30]  That's different, too.  It's different, and yet all acceptable.  Yeah, that was not acceptable.  All right, let's hear it again.  Now, the thing is, he's died in a depression.  Did you know?  I don't have anything.  He doesn't have confidence in it.  It sounds a little like a coochie-coo sound, too.  Like, that's the torture of your baby.  Coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie-coochie.  Also, I'm at a slight disadvantage because my mother did not let us play with toy guns  until we were, like, 11 years old.  Oh, you were that kid?  Yeah.  No.  My mother was a very big, eat your vegetables, no toy guns. 
[01:41:00]  That was terrible.  But then she leaves the family, and then she walked out on you.  And you haven't talked to her in years.  Well, the great little dead fucking came through town.  When the dead started touring again, she left with them.  Now, you, but see, here's the weird thing, and this, like, even happened.  Well, like, if you don't give a kid a gun to play with, he'll just pick up a stick.  Sure.  You want to, you were pretending, I saw, like, a kid will pick up a flower and, you know,  you're just trying to shoot other things when you're a child. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, whatever was, whatever, even a spoon, cutlery, anything that was long was a gun.  So you're saying you would use a ladle as a young person.  Yeah, anything that's long and thin could be a gun.  You would make Lego guns.  Like another man's penis.  Well, I didn't grow up in the nudist colony, so I don't know.  Like you did, Roddy.  It's holding on the dead.  I'm going to play guns with you.  Oh, I'm pulling that out of your hands.  Why isn't Roland in here with his machine gun sound?  He's in the other.  No, I want him in here. 
[01:42:00]  I think Roland, I'm going to guess, Roland's going to have a completely bizarre one.  And I think, unlike us, Roland hasn't stopped making them.  I think he's still making machine gun sounds.  He'll be like, pew, pew.  His gun is going to shoot question marks.  Right.  You watch this.  Thanks for rushing in, Roland.  Whoa, this was...  Yeah.  Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.  So that is if Fred Astaire had a machine gun. 
[01:42:30]  Rat-tat-tat-tat.  You're the rat-tat-tat guy.  Now, why is it that machine gun sounds are like snowflakes?  Why does that fucking happen?  That's a great question.  I didn't even know my machine gun sound.  I had to come up with one.  Now, if you do this at a party, and I've done it before, everyone at the party, just like  we did here, will have different sounds.  And yet, we all think we're doing the correct sounds.  And yet, you're acceptable of other people's.  You're like, whatever.  That's a fucking machine gun.  Can I hear Roland's again? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat.  Yeah, yours is 1930s, Roland.  And it fades out.  When did it, when, I mean, you're fucking hanging, you know, this is like some kind of  Al Capone shit that you're doing.  It's a Tommy gun.  Yeah, you're doing a Tommy gun.  You got the Tommy gun.  For like, Scarface.  Further away from the mic.  Yeah.  That's what this show needs.  Further away from the mic.  You know what I'm saying?  I got a great bed for you guys.  Jesus.  Do you do that with a phone?  Do you wander away from the telephone? 
[01:43:30]  Sometimes.  Yeah.  What are you afraid of, Roland?  What's your biggest fear, Roland?  You seem to be very afraid.  Oh, you can't say that on the air.  I know who he means.  Roland's, the writing on his shirt gets smaller and smaller every day.  What's that about?  Seriously.  No, this is an official Bruce Springsteen shirt.  Oh, yes.  And yet, you would not know it unless you were right up on top of you.  Yeah, that would be the tough line at the eye test, right? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, right.  That would be the one to go, oh, fuck.  There they are.  You're going to need reading glasses.  Do you cheat at the eye test?  I do.  No.  I just say, I squint.  I'm like, why am I doing this?  Because I want to fucking, am I that competitive?  I want to do well at the eye test.  I really do, though.  But then in the end, you're just at a disadvantage.  I know how stupid it is, but I want to show off or something.  Well, you want the doctor to be like, wow, that is good vision.  I remember feeling that way when I was younger.  Yeah.  And then, remember when you were a kid, they would give you the hearing test?  Yeah, the beeping. 
[01:44:30]  Where you had to put your fucking hands up for it?  And sometimes you would throw your hand up, and you'd see that quizzical look, so you'd  put it down like, I'm just starting to think, I hear shit now.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I do agree with you that you want to have them go, you know, I've never seen this before  in another human being.  Yeah.  Remarkable powers.  I always wanted to be like a child prodigy at hearing and seeing.  Right.  I had to fucking get glasses recently.  That LASIK that I got done at the NAW.  Oh, yeah.  Finally wore out, because I'm an older gentleman now.  And now I need glasses for driving, which sucks, because now when I look down, when I 
[01:45:00]  want to do my texting while I'm driving, I can't see shit.  Well, could you go get another LASIK, or have you fucked that up?  Well, of course, the eye doctor, which is the competition, said no.  So now I've got to go my...  Why did he say no?  Because he wants the business.  Because if you go to LASIK, guy, they do all the tests right there for you.  Dude, I'm going to give you a little bit of advice here, and I would go full Elvis Costello  glasses for you.  Yeah?  Just Buddy Holly this shit up.  Just big, thick, fucking dark.  And that'll be your new scene. 
[01:45:30]  And that's it?  Yeah, that'll be your whole new thing.  I need a new fucking look.  I think it'll be great for you.  Yeah.  I'm going to go with a new look.  But I fucking hate it.  I hate wearing glasses again.  I was the eight-year-old with the glasses.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, eight.  And then NAW, what, 11 years ago, I got the LASIK.  Now, was the four eyes thing, like, a fucking problem for you as a kid?  Would, like, do the other kids taunt you for having glasses?  Where do you think this attitude came from?  Yeah.  Protection.  You never had a good day because of the glasses.  Right.  I was the kid.  I was the first kid to get the glasses. 
[01:46:00]  There's a thing of, like, I grew up in a neighborhood where we would create our own racism compared, like, any difference that we could have.  And we all used to walk to school.  And we jumped and kicked the kid almost to death because he took a bus.  He took a bus to another school?  That was your line.  Yeah.  So we fucking waited for him.  We were all, like, fucking hiding.  And, like, we all came out.  When he got off his bus, he got off alone.  And we just, like, thumped the shit out of him. 
[01:46:30]  And then, like, years later, he goes, you know, when you fucking guys did that to me.  Like, I know him in high school.  And he was like, what was that about?  What was wrong?  You know, and I go, well, didn't you take a bus?  I mean, you know, you're with a fucking guy riding a bus.  I thought we were walkers in our neighborhood.  We went to Locust Dome.  Right.  But you will find a reason.  I remember we hit a kid because he had leg braces.  Jesus.  And we just fucking pushed him over and knocked him down and called him fucking fuck. 
[01:47:00]  And then later, you had to try to explain to your parents when you were called in the school.  And you're like, well, this guy thinks he's badass.  He's, you know, got, like, leg braces.  You're trying to find any defensive fucking move that you can.  Like, why are kids so angry?  Because nothing has happened to them yet.  Life will knock you down.  But, man, you hear it all the time.  Kids are assholes.  And kids could be mean.  I mean, what do they have to be mean about at that age?  They just don't have the filter that adults have.  We want to be as mean as they are. 
[01:47:30]  They just haven't learned social, proper social behavior.  It's in our DNA to be mean.  A guy with leg braces, who in this room doesn't want to just shove him over?  And I know one thing.  I mean, he would never come back to reunion.  Not with those fucking braces.  Still work.  But I actually thought, like, the reason that we went after him was because he's kind of cocky with his fucking attention, his leg braces.  Like, it wasn't like I thought I was just being mean.  I thought I was doing the right thing.  Yeah.  But there was anything different that you could find as a child. 
[01:48:00]  That's all it took.  Where are you at with bullying?  Big, hot topic these days.  I don't understand why everyone's acting like it's no.  Because in my neighborhood, I felt like as I ran away from the bullies, at the same time, I was chasing smaller kids.  Right.  It was almost like...  You beat up the kid with leg braces.  But at the same time, like, this was the most terrifying thing that I remember saying as a kid.  If any of your friends would yell out, teenager, you had to start running. 
[01:48:30]  Because a teenager would see you if you were 10 and just knock you down and fucking take shit from you and do whatever.  And the only fucking defense I had was, I would say, I'm fucking coming back with my brother and we're going, I'm going to fucking make sure you're dead.  And they fucking, that was the only thing that protected me.  How old was your brother?  Obviously older.  My brother was six years older than me.  And my sister was four years older than that.  And either one of them would fucking, my mom would say, I'll go out and fucking help him. 
[01:49:00]  And I had no qualms of, hey, I want to do this on my own.  You know what I mean?  Like, yeah, let's go get this motherfucker.  Right, right, right.  We're going to kick this shit out of him.  It must have been nice to have backup like that.  A brother six years older?  Are you kidding me?  Yeah, I would actually say, when people were fucking with me, this is today.  But tomorrow, you're going to be on your back, being held down, and I'm going to be kicking you on the side of the fucking head.  So let's never forget that it's over.  Bullying is part of growing up, isn't it, Ronnie? 
[01:49:30]  I would think that it is, but I don't, you know, I get that it shouldn't be done.  But in the thing of like, my mom thought that I should hit other people.  I mean, she was an adult person and was like, go back and hit them.  And you're like, really?  I just got fucking beat up.  I would try to explain to her.  And she would be like, no, you have to have the reputation of the kid that will go fucking hit them with stuff.  I'm going to put my kid in self-defense classes real early on.  I think with you, I think it's going to be self-offense, though. 
[01:50:00]  I think your kid's going to be a bully.  You think?  Yeah.  Why?  I just have that feeling.  It's an Irish thing.  I think he's going to be a headbutter.  He's going to be a big kid.  Yeah.  He's going to be, the in-laws are all fucking big guys.  Right.  And that's another reason, I mean, he's got Philly blood in him and they're just the worst.  Oh, yeah, he does.  That's my blood.  They're the worst possible people.  He's already throwing shit.  Right.  With a smile, though.  He's got my fucking sick smile as he's throwing shit.  And he's already, I mean, being from Philly, you already think that you're better than professional athletes. 
[01:50:30]  So you can boo them and throw shit.  They really are the worst people on earth.  And yet they're our biggest fans.  It's amazing how I can have such loyal fans, which are Philly.  And I really do love Philly.  And they're the worst people on the planet.  I love the Philly guys I hang out with.  Because...  They're a different animal, absolutely.  You do love them, but they are awful.  You can even tell them that with love.  Like, I love you.  And you're horrendous.  They're the worst people.  At any given Friday night when I'm down there, I know there's a potential fucking brawl about to happen. 
[01:51:00]  Right.  Been in a few, matter of fact.  I don't really talk about it on the air.  Still?  You still get in the fight?  Not me personally.  I'm not going to make believe I'm the Mr. Tough guy still duking it out.  Fuck no.  I learned about 10, 12 years ago, getting punched in the face is not fun anymore.  When you're younger, it's kind of fun.  Were you ever a fighter?  Well, every...  You know, but I never was a fair fighter.  I was like, yes, let's all jump on that fucking guy.  Right, right.  I never...  You know, but...  I never was like, it's just me and you.  No, I don't believe in that.  There was always one group against another group. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, I don't believe in that.  I don't think there is such a thing as a fair fight.  But I also had some of the toughest friends I've ever seen in my life.  And I had friends that when we were fucking children could knock out a fucking man.  And that was like...  Wow.  It was like thrilling.  Wow.  Just like knowing that you could go anywhere in that fucking town.  But Philly is so awful, I actually saw two cops in uniform get in a fight with each other.  And start fucking with each other, pushing, and it turned into a fight.  And you're just like... 
[01:52:00]  Why the anger down there?  I don't know.  You grew up down there?  It's just fucking raised that way.  And the same thing was like when you go to a sporting event, Mike Smith would, you know,  Hall of Famer, would get booed in Philadelphia.  Would get fucking booed.  Boston is kind of similar.  I did, you know, some time up there, and they're similar to Philly.  Philly's worse, I think.  But Boston is the same mentality.  Philly's worse.  Boston, they're angry white people.  You'll see a couple cops duking it out in Boston, too.  Boston at least has Harvard.  At least they have Harvard. 
[01:52:30]  Well, you're not impressed with you, Penn?  You don't like Penn?  I don't know as much about it.  Harvard sounds better.  It does sound better.  Harvard's truly prestigious.  You, Penn, I'm sure, is good.  I know.  But then you got Yale, and then finally the rest.  Yeah.  Princeton probably even ranks above.  Now, your kids obviously were brought up differently.  So how did you teach them?  I just never said anything to them.  I tried to fucking keep everything away from the kids.  Really?  Nothing ever happened.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Let them figure it out themselves?  Let them do whatever they want. 
[01:53:00]  I don't want to be one of those people getting involved in their life.  I find that uncomfortable.  You know what I mean?  Like, just, you know, like, I would, my big thing is I never would go in their room, never,  you know.  You let them be.  Do whatever.  I think there's something to be said about that.  Yeah.  I think there's a lot.  I was brought up way too fucking strict.  I thought my sister did it right.  I tell this a lot, but my nephew is, you know, he's a doctor.  He's doing the doctor thing.  He's doing really well.  But when he was six, they were watching R-rated movies together.  And, you know, they just let them fucking be. 
[01:53:30]  And they didn't have a lot of rules around them.  You, you, you were real, your family was very strict with that?  Oh, ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Horrible curfews.  What time was your curfew?  I don't remember anymore, but it was about 11, I would say.  That's fucking, you ruled.  11.  At what age?  High school.  Oh, no.  Maybe, maybe 12 by the time I was a senior.  Maybe.  And my mom was so fucking scary.  I mean, 12.05, all hell would break loose. 
[01:54:00]  It wasn't worth it.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, that's why I acted out when I went to college.  Huh?  You were coming home drunk and fucking.  No, I was scared to do that either.  I drank in high school, but it was, it was a workaround.  I didn't come, I never walked through that door fucking hammered.  No fucking way.  The hell that I would, I would, no, no, no.  She scared the shit out of us.  So then when I went to college, I became, you know, heavy drinker, partier, all that.  I acted out like a motherfucker.  Yeah, everybody fucking snaps. 
[01:54:30]  I snapped because I didn't know, I was missing a lot, obviously.  You know?  I think the way you're doing it is the proper way.  There's no way around it.  Seriously.  I don't know.  I've talked to enough people.  I think you gotta, I think you gotta kinda let your kids be, do their thing.  Maybe guide them a little bit.  But no matter what happens, I think the kids come back and go, you fuck out.  My mom's strictness was based on her fucking, you know, her mind.  You know?  She was convinced something horrible was happening to us all the time. 
[01:55:00]  So to prevent that, she needed us in the house.  So she could get a good night's sleep.  So when you were out, she was like, I think they're being ground up in the fucking-  Oh, fuck yeah.  Losing her mind.  Like, I'm a horrible sleeper to this day because my mom, I woke up many fucking nights.  I've told this on our show too, but Ronnie may be hearing it for the first time.  My mouth's, my mom's face literally inches away because she's seen if we're breathing.  Oh, God.  See?  Middle of the night.  So now if I hear a noise, I'm up.  So.  It's like you're in fucking Vietnam every fucking night of your life. 
[01:55:30]  You're fucking, you're in shit.  Yeah, it was.  Fucking Charlie's in the perimeter every fucking night for you.  You can hear a fucking twig snuff.  We were lucky to have a bigger house, so I made sure I was on the other side of the house most of the time.  If I was not in her area, it was way better.  Yeah.  I mean, just shoes askew in the middle of the room could set her off.  That's a messy room.  Yeah, I can't believe it.  You have a comfortable house.  It was a very old-  Huh?  You got to have a comfortable house. 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  You got to be able to come home and act like, no, everything doesn't have to be all right.  You know, some days you go to your room and literally everything you own is in the middle of the floor because you might have left a shirt on the floor.  Just nonsense.  Just dump it all out there.  Oh, sometimes on the driveway.  Yeah.  Not me.  I don't think I ever got the driveway.  But certainly the whole room.  Because of one messy thing you left, now logically follow this.  Now the whole room has to be a mess.  And now clean it up.  Did you ever even try to say, who am I? 
[01:56:30]  Gomer Pyle?  Is this the Marine Corps?  I never told you.  Why are we living like this?  What fucking difference does it make?  Made it worse.  Please.  Don't question anything.  Just fucking-  I just watched the clock.  I'll be 18 soon enough.  I'll be 18 soon enough.  And then I could do my thing.  And Travis thought he had a bout down there in St. Pete.  Right.  He's fucking playing with fucking 80-year-olds.  Right.  What part of St. Pete did you live in, Travis?  Jeez.  I was on 51st Avenue.  All right.  Is that bad?  I mean, thinking back. 
[01:57:00]  What could he get on 51st?  Nothing.  Ronnie.  It was a dead-end street.  A little weed?  A little weed on 51st?  You know, St. Pete is a kind of a slow town.  I mean, the south side of St. Pete is as dangerous as ever anywhere in the world.  But Watley didn't grow up far from you.  Yeah.  Watley's Pinellas Park.  It was just a boring, you know-  Watley's not boring.  Just a slow where you could fucking-  Where you could actually drive down the street in a golf cart.  You could actually fucking go on 95 in a golf cart.  A golf cart.  There's something appealing about that.  Yeah.  It was me and my brother and-  I want to be car-  Go ahead.  Sorry.  It was just a lot across the street where we would just play baseball. 
[01:57:30]  By yourselves?  Yeah.  You pitch the ball and run into the outfield hoping that you could catch a football ball?  That's so sad, isn't it?  That's really sad.  That's so sad.  We had one of those pitching, you know, you would throw it into the net and bounce back.  Yeah, we had one of those for a while.  And then my dad came up here to look for a job once he got let go down in Florida.  And I was just sitting in the lot playing by myself.  You were a lonely kid.  For a time, yeah.  Have you heard about the weird games that Travis and his brother used to play?  What are you talking about?  Well, I mean, I know you're discussing it, but I don't think Ron is- 
[01:58:00]  Why is your mic so much louder all the time?  Mine?  I hear you.  He's screaming.  You're always louder than everyone else.  You have eight radio shows.  What else do you need?  You need your mic louder now, too?  It's all correct.  I don't have control of the board.  All right, go ahead, Sam.  You got fucking Jimmy sick.  You're fucking talking so bad.  Sorry, Jim.  You all right?  I was fucking spitting in the trash can.  I wish you could see this.  No, I don't know.  Ron, did you ever play undie flip?  No.  I don't remember the rules, Travis. 
[01:58:30]  You know, Sam, the rules are quite simple.  You need two players to play, obviously.  So me and my brother-  To play what?  Undie flip.  Undie flip.  Yeah.  So, you know, you get your-  New Twitter name, by the way.  Undie flip.  You get your underwear down by your ankles.  Nude, of course, because it was normal.  And then you flip it, and you try and get it on the ceiling fan.  And then you and your brother blow each other?  How does that fucking end?  I mean, seriously, this is why people would normally go and see a shrink.  And then you made me play with undie flip, and they were on the fan. 
[01:59:00]  Why undies were on the fan?  It's weird.  When I told the staff about it, they didn't think it was normal either.  Why undies were on the fan?  Don't you fucking get it?  Why do you have to be naked?  I mean, I thought undie flip was weird, but I thought undie flip was-  Could you just get some underwear out of the drawer and play undie flip when you're six years old?  Undie flip became normal after I heard about the other game that Travis used to play with his brother.  I believe the name of that game was peenie flip.  Oh, God.  You had to put your fucking cock on the fan? 
[01:59:30]  No.  All right.  We haven't talked about peenie flip yet.  I thought I said it.  What's peenie flip?  Well, peenie flip, again, nude.  But this was more of just maybe a spectator sport, I guess, because we weren't interacting with each other.  But you would just take your hands and kind of real quick, in a circular motion, just slap your penis.  Slap your penis, yeah.  Now, you guys were doing this last year?  Yes.  I'm going to go back for Thanksgiving. 
[02:00:00]  How old's your brother?  Like old ties?  He's a year younger than me.  You do undie flip?  Yeah.  You know, it's a Christmas thing.  A couple of creeps.  Seriously.  That's a little weird, man.  We did the same thing, except for we had a video game.  That was it.  It was a fucking played video.  Again, my mother wouldn't let us have a Nintendo.  So you started molesting each other.  Yeah.  So I was like 12 years old.  We had to make up our own games.  You had a strict mom, too.  Yeah, very much, yeah.  Yeah.  But it was based on her shit.  That's what, you know.  Yeah, but then, like.  Was it based on her shit, or she was trying to raise you, probably?  I think she was just trying to raise us, right? 
[02:00:30]  She was, like, you know, I haven't spoken to her in 10 years, but she was a very good mother.  Yeah, my mom had some good qualities.  Yeah, like, she went nuts at a certain point, but.  But that makes for boring radio.  Yeah.  Because I hear it.  Who wants to talk about, you know.  I hear it from family sometimes.  I'm like, yeah, but that side's boring.  Who wants to ever bring that up?  Yeah, they want to hear the psychology.  No one wants to talk about, like, having a good child.  They want to hear about, you know, the whole household stopping until we, you know, find  the blue comb.  Yeah.  Stuff like that.  An undie flip.  You know, I stopped.  I haven't combed my hair in fucking decades because of that. 
[02:01:00]  I don't own a comb.  I have no desire to own a comb or a brush.  Because we had to find the blue comb.  What is it?  Why do we hold on to the childhood thing so much, though?  I mean, who gives a fuck?  I don't know.  I don't know why we continue to fucking care.  And yet, every single person.  I released a lot.  Because I finally went to a therapist.  I had to.  Yeah.  I released a lot.  So now I almost find humor in it.  Were you crying at the therapist?  No.  No. 
[02:01:30]  You didn't release it yet.  Huh?  You didn't release it yet.  Well, why do you have to cry?  Because some people.  Watch Prince of Tides.  Oh, God.  He is so Prince of Tides right now.  Who, me?  Yeah.  But why do you have to cry to release?  It's just cleansing.  Yeah?  Because probably more happened, Ope, than you even remember.  Yeah.  And I'm sure there's more to Undy Flip.  There was a break-in.  There was a break-in.  Yes.  Caught somebody.  There was a break-in.  Your brother saw through the window.  At first, they were fucking your sister.  That was okay.  Like, whatever.  She's a girl.  She deserves it. 
[02:02:00]  But then it was your time.  Do you really have to cry, you think?  It's healthy.  I think you got to.  Sure.  I think you got to cry for what happened to that little boy, that little four-eyed fucking  boy.  Yeah.  Come on.  That couldn't have a comb or go out and play with the other kids.  Where is that little blue-eyed sloppy dork?  Yeah.  I was kind of a nerd, man.  Were you a Catholic school boy?  Um, not Catholic school, but raised very Catholic.  Yeah.  You know, religion classes on a Tuesday night at some weirdo's house.  Played CYO basketball? 
[02:02:30]  My dad ran the league.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it was barely based on the church.  Did you have a low ceiling?  Low ceiling?  Oh, no, no, no.  Real gyms.  Oh, so, because so many of that used to be played in fucking, like, church basements,  those basketball things.  That's right.  So you'll know guys that played that, because they'll just fucking shoot bricks all day.  Right, right.  And then it's just line drives when they're outside, right?  Right.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Put some fucking arc on that.  Is that Sinbad?  I don't know, you racist.  It's just another black man.  Seriously.  We should break, though, because I've got to pee anyway. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, let's break so we get set up for Sinbad.  We can get back into this.  Yeah.  Because his show's about family anyway.  Is it?  His new show.  It's perfect.  It's called It's Just Family.  Oh, by the way, Iraq, why did you play the Red Hot Chili Peppers?  Because everything has a meaning today.  What was that for?  Just because it sounded good, I couldn't find another reason to play something else.  What are you playing in a break that has meaning right now?  Nothing.  We're going to end quick if Sinbad's coming right up.  You got that song, Petey Flip?  I'm going to do One Question, another show that Sam does.  Jesus.  One Question is a segment, not a show. 
[02:03:30]  That's a show.  Great.  That's your other radio show.  It's called One Question.  I want that gig.  How much are you getting paid for One Question?  How much are you getting paid for any of this?  A lot of fucking money, obviously.  It's done good.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  Primetime Sam Roberts  and One Question with a guest we couldn't get.  Rockstar and handsome entertainment reporter 
[02:04:00]  Mark McGrath.  Primetime Sam Roberts here with Mark McGrath.  Mark, what type of house plants do you like?  I like a nice fern, you know, or I like a palm, a palm.  I know what it's called.  It's called a palm in the corner.  What's it called?  A palm tree?  Yeah, I like palm ferns.  Palm ferns in my house.  Thank you for your time.  You're welcome.  This has been Primetime Sam Roberts 
[02:04:30]  and One Question with a guest we couldn't get  on the Opie and Anthony Show.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Well, let's do this thing.  We got Sinbad outside the studio  premiering his new show.  It's just family Tuesday, April 12th at 10 p.m.  on the We Network.  The legendary comedian.  He knows you.  Hi, how are you?  You know Ronnie?  No, we just met here. 
[02:05:00]  That was it.  Hey, Sinbad, Opie.  What's up, brother?  I see you got the entourage.  We all noticed the entourage.  Oh, you know, that's my daughter and my wife.  Is the son.  She's tall.  The tall one's your daughter?  How tall is she?  About six feet.  She's trying to be taller than me, man.  Yeah.  How have you been?  I'm good, man.  You look really good.  We never met, but I mean, you look, I mean, I remember watching you from years and you look  exactly the same.  You do look exactly the same. 
[02:05:30]  I'm going to deal with the devil.  It's nice to not age though, right?  I age.  I just do.  I replace both knees, man.  Did you?  Yeah, this one is a year.  This one is six months right now.  Was it genetic or did you athletically hurt them?  Basketball.  Basketball destroys knees, doesn't it?  Basketball destroys knees.  Skin destroys knees.  All that stuff, man.  You know, I forgot it.  Trying to be cool with it, though, man.  Trying to make it work.  Trying to make it look sexy.  Yeah.  You played a lot of basketball?  Yeah.  Were you good?  I was good.  I was trying to jump out the gym, brother.  But I mean, you know, a shot at the NBA, shot at Division I. 
[02:06:00]  When I was in high school, I was two years older than Magic.  And a friend said, man, he's got to go drive to Lansing, Michigan, and see this cat.  I said, who, man?  We all think we got game.  I called my father.  I said, man, I just saw a dude going to go play pro basketball.  At 15, this cat was laying it down in the park.  I said, who is this cat, man?  He was about 6'6 then.  He was the guards.  He was out there, man.  He was throwing and dishing.  I said, man, you can't stop this dude.  Wow.  I had to put my pride aside.  I went home and I said, I saw a guy that just is nasty as all. 
[02:06:30]  I said, drugs don't get him and alcohol doesn't get him.  This cat's going to play.  Who knew what would get him, too?  No one saw that coming.  No, man, who thought?  And even that didn't take him down.  He was the first person who didn't die from that.  First person actually got stronger.  Look, Magic looks stronger now, man, than when we planned.  Yeah, he does.  Do you think he was a better player?  I've heard it argue that Jordan's the greatest scorer of all time.  I think of Bill Javar.  But do you think that he was a better all-around player than Jordan?  All-around, he was a better player.  I have to say this.  I put three people in my top three list. 
[02:07:00]  You can move them around anywhere.  It's Dr. J, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.  Oh, okay.  Those three are just like, I put them in my squad.  They're all nasty.  That's a good list.  I got Frazier on my list.  Oh, you got to put Clyde.  Yeah.  You got to have Clyde, man.  We got Portachek.  You got to throw him in.  Just go throw a white person.  You know what?  I put in half a check.  Half a check was a beast, man.  Jerry West was beating Pistol P.  Pistol P was amazing.  But I will tell you this about Clyde.  And when he walks through New York, it's still like it's 1970.  Dude, he's still awesome.  People go crazy.  Him and Earl and Pearl, man. 
[02:07:30]  We had Walt in here.  Yeah, man.  What a great guy.  He is amazing.  He really is still to this day.  He is like 67, I think.  He had the flamboyant check.  Yeah, he wrote that book Cool.  He was the first one put in the book that he had sex before games.  We were all told as kids that you can't have sex play ball.  He broke all the rules for everybody.  Changed the game up.  You know what else was crazy about those guys?  They just caught regular flights after games.  They used to leave.  And made regular money.  Yeah.  And made regular money.  It's not like now what cats...  I think what happens is cats make so much money. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  So much money.  Some of them have game.  I mean, they don't have game, man.  Yeah, that's true.  They had day jobs.  Baseball players had day jobs.  You're right.  All season, they would work a regular gig.  Yeah.  Until the fucking preseason.  And also, the other thing is there were so few teams then that every game was like an all-star game.  You're right.  You're right.  Every game.  I'm like, if you were playing the Lakers, you know, Knicks against the Lakers was like East-West would be now.  It was phenomenal.  And the players were even friends.  The players knew each other, man.  Now it's just different. 
[02:08:30]  The game is different.  The money is different.  You still like it just as much as when you were growing up?  You know what's funny?  It was so much damage from the playing ball.  And I had a bad college experience.  It just turned me off to a lot of stuff.  I watched.  You know what?  I watched.  When Michael retired, I have no teams I love.  I have players I love.  But when Michael retired, I left with Jordan.  Right.  That was it.  I was a big-time Knicks fan, but I loved Jordan's run, and I had no problem with him winning.  That's the difference between him and Kobe.  See, Michael, even if he was not on your team, you wanted him to kill your team. 
[02:09:00]  You wanted to witness him in 55.  You wanted your team to win, but you wanted to witness him in 55.  You wanted a Knicks victory.  Yes.  You're so right.  You nailed it.  With him scoring 60 or whatever.  Kobe's the guy that you kind of want to bang a chicken Colorado with.  Man, that moves.  He'll walk.  Who's the best player in the league right now?  You know, I still, man.  Top three.  Let's just do the top three.  You know, Kobe's going to be top three.  LeBron's going to be top three.  I like Wade, man.  I'm trying to think.  No, Dwight Howard could be. 
[02:09:30]  Still?  Dwight Howard could be one of the national cast.  He's strong himself.  If he would get that Olajuwon spin move, if he'd get that spin move, that's the only  thing I'm missing in this game, if the boy jumps too high, he's too strong, he'd be  unstoppable.  Unstoppable, man.  And now you've got Stoddermeyer.  The thing is, it's going to take y'all two years here because they gave up the squad  to get the squad.  That's why Denver's doing well.  Y'all, they got the squad in Denver, man.  This is why Sinbad is interesting.  Because I really hate basketball, but I'm enjoying listening to you talk about basketball. 
[02:10:00]  Honestly, I never talk basketball for more than three seconds, and I'm absolutely done  with it.  But you're making it very interesting.  What's your sport?  I like MMA, but I mean, just, you're making it interesting to listen to.  I actually want to hear who you're talking about.  Because I'm not a baseball man.  You don't like baseball at all.  Man, it's just, I don't know why, even as a kid, man, I hated playing.  I used to fall asleep in the outfield.  I used to lay down.  I used to fall asleep in the outfield of the team.  I just wanted the uniform.  I just, the game was just so long. 
[02:10:30]  It's just, you only get bats so many times.  But see, this is what kills me.  When you're a kid, normally if you're good at one sport, you're good at all the sports.  Yeah.  Well, we played all sports back then.  Remember back then?  Everything.  You played everything.  You didn't play one sport.  Right.  Yeah.  So you had to be constantly telling your parents, I'm going on to the next thing.  And then I didn't get dropped off.  Did your parents used to take you?  Drop off.  Yeah.  Back and forth.  You get your mitt.  You get your basketball.  Your dad would drive by you.  My dad would drive by me and blow the horn.  Hurry up.  You're going to be late.  Man.  But you never walk by yourself.  You're bored with me with you.  Right.  Remember, you're never by yourself. 
[02:11:00]  You're always walking with your friends.  And somebody might have a bike, but he'd get off his bike and walk with you.  If you didn't have your bike, you had to take the least of the least.  You know, so everybody else is walking.  I'll walk my bike.  Where'd you grow up?  Michigan, man.  Oh, it was Michigan.  That's why the magic thing.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's funny.  We always have prep sheets for guys.  We come in.  Everybody knows Sinbad.  But it's funny.  On the prep sheet, he first appeared on Star Search, where he reportedly beat Dennis Miller.  Reportedly, like it's like a...  Like it didn't necessarily happen.  It might not happen.  Maybe it didn't happen.  What is that rumor and innuendo? 
[02:11:30]  It wasn't real.  It wasn't real.  Yeah.  Allegedly, you beat...  Just fucking throwing our guys under the bus.  Was there a terrible wording?  A tainted judge or something?  Or what's going on?  You know, Dennis...  I mean, it bugged him, though.  Did I beat him?  It bothered him.  It bothered him.  I think Dennis thought he was the most intelligent comic to walk the face of the earth.  Right.  And all the rest of us were just taking up space.  And you gave him a bit smashing...  No, I didn't know.  He's a smart dude, but...  Dude, comedy and anybody in this game, you know...  Plus, there's a different kind of smarts.  You read a lot of books, but I know homeless cats that hang out in a library and read a lot of books. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I was telling these guys, when you first broke out, it was all really Star Search, which...  You know what?  It was comedy clubs, but back in the day, it's funny.  I was able to sell out comedy clubs.  You were able to get a reputation.  I started in 83.  Okay.  And you were able to get a reputation just working.  There was no...  All of us was Johnny Carson.  There was no TV.  There was no hope for HBO.  There was none of that.  So, you had to develop a name for yourself.  And then when Star Search came, that became the whole, the nationwide recognition.  That was a tipping point.  Yes. 
[02:12:30]  But I saw you at Giggles in Tampa.  Dude.  Destroy a room.  What do you know about Giggles, man?  Well, I started right after you, but I knew...  Johnny Cash, they called him, because even his cash would bounce.  Yes, man.  Dude, that's the cocaine years.  Yeah.  That's when comedy, dude, they were paid.  They had cocaine on the coffee machines.  They had cocaine on tables.  Waitressers couldn't wait to take orders to run back.  And it was...  D.A. took that club out, man.  Yeah.  Well, there was even a thing with him where you would go, yeah, I'm ready to get paid. 
[02:13:00]  And you'd go, yeah, but let's see.  These rails on Monday.  These rails on Tuesday.  Oh, my God.  Really?  You owe me right now $250.  They owe him.  So, Mitchell Walters never could leave.  No, man.  Oh.  Mitchell Walters actually became an indentured servitude to that fight.  Who's talking about my other man?  He also worked at all the strip clubs.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Cody Hare.  Yeah.  At O'Brien.  Oh, God.  Kind of a scary guy, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  Adam Leslie.  Adam Leslie.  Adam Leslie.  Adam Leslie was down there, yeah.  If it's the same Adam Leslie, he committed suicide.  Did he? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  If it's the same guy you're talking about, I believe he did commit suicide.  It was not long ago.  I didn't know that.  Yeah.  No, man.  Unless there's another Adam Leslie.  They were, they were, no, they were characters.  I mean, comedy was characters.  Right.  Comedy was characters back in the day, man.  Nick, I think it was about the same time that you were doing Star Search, but I saw people  seriously running up the walls.  He took me in.  He took me in.  Johnny Cochran took me in.  Dude, I showed up in that.  No money in my pocket.  Yeah.  I said, I can go to Florida.  I can sleep on the beach. 
[02:14:00]  It was like, that's how my deep, my thinking was.  So what, what funded my, I was in Kansas City.  I got kicked out the military from Kansas City.  I only been doing comedy about three weeks.  And the guy said, you want to come headline my club?  And I said, what's that?  And the guy said, you got to talk for an hour.  I said, okay, I'll do that.  And I'll never forget a bunch of comics that were me.  Man, you can't do that.  You, I said, well, man, we make, you just mad because you're not going.  So it was a strip club called Carmichael's Academy of Cultural Anatomy in Destin, Florida.  And I was opening for, remember Morgana, the baseball's kissing bandit?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was opening for her. 
[02:14:30]  But you know, I was one of the smartest business women.  She invested in Wendy's.  She invested in barcoding.  And the guy who was a bodyguard was her husband.  But she couldn't say that because it wouldn't look sexy.  Right.  And she carried a 350 Magnum in her purse.  Yes.  But man.  What was her act?  She just danced?  She just danced.  Yeah.  And remember, she inscribed to the very end.  And so people just, and wives came.  She was like a family show.  It was like Hooters.  So it was, so I'm in, I'm like, the guy wanted to get me a car if I would stay and emcee the club.  I said, man, I got to go. 
[02:15:00]  So I go down, I heard about Giggles.  I heard about this place in Tampa.  I catch a bus down.  I got just enough money to stay in a hotel across the street for one night.  And I go across the street.  Linda was Johnny Calkers' wife.  I mean, Johnny, yeah.  So what happens, Linda, I go, look, I'm a comedian.  I knew open mic night was the night before I'm lying.  And so I'm here for open mic night.  She goes, that was yesterday.  I go, like, oh, man.  Oh.  She goes, well, you can come back next week.  I'm like this.  Um, look, I'm just in town.  Do you mind, do you mind if I, um, can I just, can I just stay and, uh, can I do something tonight? 
[02:15:30]  So she calls Johnny.  He goes, you can just do something tonight.  I said, oh, can I stay here in the club all day?  So now she's getting scared of me.  Because I had the blonde hair.  I had feathered earrings.  And I said, oh, can I get something to eat?  She says, you know what?  You can't be that funny.  So they let me get on stage, man.  And I, and I'm guilty.  I said, I was working back then just to get food and a place to stay.  So they let me, they gave me a place to stay.  They made me the house MC, man.  And how quickly before that and Star Search? 
[02:16:00]  It wasn't long, right?  It was a year.  Yeah, it was like a year.  83, 84.  It was a year.  By the year, I was on Star Search.  Were you always clean, too?  Because you were dirty when I started.  Oh, you were dirty.  I was there when I started.  But no, what happens, we always want to be Richard.  Everybody's trying to be Richard.  Everybody's trying to be Carl.  Everybody's trying to be what the greats were.  And I said, man, we're all bad.  We're all bad imitations.  We're all.  There's no other Richard.  God made one of those and just said, that's it.  That's all you get.  So I said, I switched it up.  Plus, I heard a woman say, you know, my dad came to one of my shows, man.  And I cleaned it up.  Not that he had been mad.  I just cleaned it up.  And then I heard a woman say, it's nice that somebody didn't cuss me out on stage. 
[02:16:30]  I heard a woman say, I said, well, what?  I'll switch my stuff up a little bit.  But I said, I'll still take it to the edge.  I said, I found I could talk about more things being clean.  I could talk about sex, drugs, everything.  But then Hollywood killed me when I got to Hollywood.  He's clean.  He's squeaky clean.  He's a family man.  I said, y'all just destroy it.  Just say I'm funny.  You just destroy everything I'm trying to do.  Because they don't know.  Hollywood, they have the streams.  You're clean.  You're dirty.  He's a good person.  He's a bad person.  He's a drug addict.  He's a choir boy.  I said, look, there's a lot of stuff in between.  But Hollywood doesn't know how to do that.  They're awful because everything out there is show business driven. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you.  So there's no, nothing, everything is based on your seven minutes, your ten minutes.  Yes, yes.  And every set, it's like the guy from CBS will be here tonight.  That's why LA comics don't have fun with each other.  That's it.  You hit it on the head right there.  Everybody's living for that moment of fame, that moment to get a TV show.  New Yorkers were like, dude, I came here.  Comics were like, man, they were doing gritty of life.  The guys were working, doing things.  I'm going up to this little place.  There's a little hole in the wall, but don't worry, they'll give you 50 bucks.  I said, man, I love this East Coast drive. 
[02:17:30]  They had to drive, man.  Boston comics were the same way.  Boston comics are brutal.  Really funny guys.  A lot of great comics in Boston.  They're saying you have to go.  Is that real?  I know you have a real busy schedule around here.  Do we have a couple minutes?  Huh?  He has to go?  We just won't go.  We just won't leave.  Does he really have to go?  We wouldn't waste all that time on basketball.  No kidding.  It's not my idea of a funny joke to put up, Sinbad has to go.  They're telling you?  Yeah.  I get told things and then I really don't.  No, I believe you.  I'm just like, well, fuck.  How much time do we have with him?  I don't know.  They look like 15. 
[02:18:00]  Well, Sinbad, just in case you have to go in a minute or two.  Fuck.  Tell us about this show.  It's just family.  Yeah, that's my family.  We're doing a reality show on the Women's Entertainment Network.  Now, I don't know how they picked me up.  That came out the blue, man.  I never thought they would pick me up.  But what happens is I didn't like reality shows, man.  They just want people to fight.  They want families to kill each other.  I'm waiting for somebody to get shot.  Yeah.  Everybody's waiting for that.  For somebody to get shot on the show.  But I say, you know what?  They weren't buying sitcoms.  I mean, the game has changed.  If you're entertaining, man, it's like the dumb people. 
[02:18:30]  I mean, look, Jersey Shore made cash.  Yeah.  They made money.  So everybody's like this.  They making the money we should be making.  So I said, look, man, let me use the reality show as a foot in the door.  But let's do it different.  We'll do our family, but let's not just show fighting and stuff.  Let's get creative with it.  Let's show our lives.  It's my family.  Be married to me.  We were divorced for 10 years.  We're back together.  And to be with me is a crazy thing.  My whole family, my daughter's funny.  She sings.  She got an album out.  My son does videos and music.  And my wife was the one that did not want to be. 
[02:19:00]  I said, look, if you get on TV, you open, people can be criticized.  It's the first thing because everybody got a blog.  Everybody's got a blog.  Everybody got a bulletin board.  Just some gutless stuff.  But, you know, I said, let's just do it.  And it's working.  And you're still doing stand-up?  Oh, never stop.  Oh, good, good, good.  Never stop.  I'll never give that up.  You'll love it, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck, I didn't know we had a very limited time.  That really bums me out.  Yeah, Roland is saying he really has to go.  Pop back in, maybe, in between 100 for a while.  I'm here for like three days.  Yeah, I would love to, love to talk to you for longer.  Yeah.  That's the problem when you get these places like this. 
[02:19:30]  They've got 900 stations.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll go to nine joints.  Well, the show is on, you're really a very interesting dude.  It's called Sinbad is Just Family.  It premieres Tuesday, April the 12th.  That's next Tuesday.  It's at 10 o'clock on the WE Network.  And I'm very interested to check out your life because, you know, I'm happy to finally meet you.  We kind of jacked up.  Yeah, Ronnie just left.  He's trying to figure out if Sinbad can stay.  But he's really got to go.  Yeah, he's got to get him on the radar.  We're going to do more of this.  We're going to do it, man.  I said, Chris, we're doing a play, huh? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm going to check that out.  Yeah, I would check that out.  I would check out Chris Rockland.  Yeah, let's do this.  All right, we'll do a...  Is this me?  Yeah, we'll do a quick break and we'll be back, obviously.  The Virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  Fuckin' Ronnie B. in the house today.  Are you going to do a bunch of other shows today or is this it for you, sir? 
[02:20:30]  I'm going to do a little bit of the Sam Crossover show and a little bit of a show called Ron and Fez.  I'm going to be like Sinbad on that show.  I'm not standing in the whole time.  I'm just going to come in.  You're going to give Fezzy the stick?  I can't believe...  Give Fezzy the stick today for two.  All right, Fez is going to take the stick.  Fez is, as you can say, every day he's improving, every day he's getting better, and he's ready to run with it today.  But...  I'm more scared of him now than I've ever been because he's not growing anything.  That scares me. 
[02:21:00]  You always have him growing something, whether it's his hair, whether it's some fuckin' mustache from the 1800s, a beard.  Right now, nothing's going on, and that scares me the most.  Maybe what we'll do as a contest, what should Fezzy grow?  It's got to be old school, like fuckin' mutton chops.  I like that look on him, too, and he'll get very...  I mean, he could do...  Could you give me some mustache styles, mustache and beard styles?  Can we settle this right now?  I saw him do a...  Go to, like, a Teddy Roosevelt thing for him.  Teddy Roosevelt, yeah.  I think it would be really great.  Because I don't like him clean shaven. 
[02:21:30]  No, it's scary.  It means that he's got too much time on his hands or something.  Who?  Fezzy.  We're going to give him a new thing he's got to do right now.  We're a little disappointed.  See, Ronnie gave us a bit today.  I'm going to give him a bit.  He did the fuckin' machine gun thing.  I liked it.  Now we do something for you, Ronnie.  This could be the perfect...  Look at the Teddy Roosevelt.  And Fez actually can kind of almost look exactly like that with the little glasses at all.  Just the stache, though?  Yeah, all right.  Well, let's keep looking like a Polk, maybe a James Harrison. 
[02:22:00]  Just keep going through old presidents.  I got one.  Because we talked about him earlier.  Walt Frazier.  Walt Frazier would be great.  We'd do a Walt Frazier on him.  The thing...  I think I brought up Walt Frazier because I thought Sinbad kind of looked like him a little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  He looked good, right?  Sinbad, yeah, he looked exactly the same.  Please have him do a Walt Frazier.  Our Walt Frazier might be perfect for Fezzy.  Because Walt had the tight mustache, the tight on the sides.  Would you even like to do this if we also have him start to fucking tan so he'll get darker? 
[02:22:30]  Like, we'll send him out.  Not tan.  Spray tan.  Snooki style.  Spray tan.  Because that shit looks weird.  And I'm sure he'll be into it.  Okay.  Is this going to be the bit?  Yeah, sure.  It can definitely be it.  It'll be good.  And that way, when Sinbad comes back to do your show, Fez will be here with a basketball under his arm.  Let's fucking settle this shit.  And keep shooting from the outside.  But you guys end up liking Sinbad, which... 
[02:23:00]  Oh, yeah, I liked him before.  Oh.  You were worried.  Well, I knew I liked him.  Well, we were talking about this during the break.  First of all, it turns out he listens to the show, and I believe him,  because he brought up a couple things, and he's a cool guy.  I asked Ronnie, like, Sinbad has become a joke, you know, in a way.  Like, people go, ah, Sinbad.  But obviously, you said he killed, and he's obviously a funny guy.  So why do people immediately go to the, ah, Sinbad thing?  The joke was never his act.  Here's what Sinbad came to represent.  And I would say this to him. 
[02:23:30]  He's clean, and again, like he said, when people think you're clean,  they automatically think that you're soft or you're mom and pop.  He became like, first of all, it's an easy name to attack Sinbad.  It's one name.  What are you, Sinbad?  It's like Carrot Top.  Right.  But then when you listen to Carrot Top, like, yeah, he's a prop act,  but you know what?  He's got some funny shit.  Scott, his name is just a self-deprecating guy.  He just became the go-to name to go after.  But if you watch Sinbad's act, he was a funny fucking dude, man.  I told you, and I don't make it up, a lot of stuff that people do, 
[02:24:00]  I think Sinbad started, which, you know, it isn't a hack  when you're the first person to do it.  Exactly.  So as it is his fault that he started that, ladies do this, men do this,  and I'm telling you, I don't know what it is,  but you could just see with his personality where you kind of liked him, right?  Yeah.  Which is a giant thing for an audience.  So the audience liked him immediately.  Right.  And then he also, I don't think, has any kind of worries of, 
[02:24:30]  I don't know where this thing is going.  He comes in here, you guys want to talk about something?  Yeah, we got talking about basketball.  He's got to be a pretty together guy to be able to play that.  Yeah, I don't think he's a hack.  Not at all.  Maybe it was how he dressed, too.  It was so...  It was very much of the time.  It just brought you right back to the 80s.  He wasn't this guy, though.  Shuggy-ducky-grack-grack.  Shuggy-ducky-grack-grack.  That guy's good, though.  That guy was terrific.  He's coming on.  He's coming on.  Shuggy-ducky-grack-grack.  But Sinbad was just the name.  If his name was fucking Sinbad Franklin,  he probably never would have got hit with those things.  But this is the stuff we would have asked him.  He was obviously open to all this. 
[02:25:00]  And I don't think he...  Yeah.  And plus, here's another thing that he did.  He got into Cosby's world, right?  He had something to do with those shows.  And a lot of people try to act like Cosby's not funny,  because he's clean.  Cosby's hilarious.  And yet, people will go out of their way to act like,  Oh, I don't like that Cosby shit.  Give me Eddie Murphy or whoever.  You know, they have a tendency to turn on people.  I listened to Cosby growing up.  Cosby's fucking ridiculous.  His storytelling is just ridiculous. 
[02:25:30]  What, a 20-minute bit on skiing?  Who would sit through that?  But it's fucking hilarious.  Do you know, I saw him again after the day I met him with you.  Ronnie was going to interview him,  and I was going to wait until after the interview to meet him.  And who was the booker that just said,  Oh, that was the guy that was Steve.  And he just goes, Oh, Jim's a comic.  And he just starts talking.  Bill just talks to you.  So me and my girlfriend went to see him in AC.  And I wanted to get the photo signed.  Like, maybe before the show, I could...  So they bring us back,  and he just sits us in the dressing room 
[02:26:00]  and holds court for a half hour.  Were you nervous?  No.  A little...  Yes and no.  Because I wanted to ask him questions.  I just picked his brain about crowds in the 60s  and Lenny Bruce and all, you know.  Was he into it?  Oh, yeah.  He was great, man.  He was very, very...  He couldn't talk about anything.  And, Ronnie, you don't get nervous when you interview people.  No.  Not a one.  What's to be nervous about?  Not a one?  What do you mean?  Someone intimidates you or...  No, no, no.  There's plenty of people that I want it to be a good interview for them.  You know what I mean?  Like, if there's somebody... 
[02:26:30]  Particularly if I liked him, like, when I was a kid,  which, you know, you do with Cosby.  Right.  When you meet Cosby,  even that day he was annoyed about coming here and stuff,  and he started to talk to me like I was Theo.  Right.  Like, where are the chairs?  I was...  You know, and I'm like,  dude, I'm fucking not...  You know, I'm not fucking working here like you think.  Right.  Calm the fuck down.  But in the meantime,  I thought it was kind of funny to be talked to like Theo.  Mm-hmm.  But, no,  I would hate for that to happen. 
[02:27:00]  What part would you be nervous about during an interview?  That's a very...  I don't know.  Just pleasing them because I'm a starstruck fruit.  Yeah.  There's a starstruck thing that happens.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You've never been starstruck.  You never lost a little sleep the night before you're interviewing someone.  Maybe you don't feel you're prepared enough or...  I think it's like any gig that you feel like right before it,  it's like being in a game where you don't think,  fuck, I wish I had two more days or whatever.  But then once it starts, it's just the regular...  Once it starts, it's easy. 
[02:27:30]  And like you said with Cosby,  the first time you met him,  you were probably very, like,  a little more starstruck than the second.  Oh, God, yeah.  You know?  And then that's the whole thing, but...  Where's the confidence come from?  Very confident person.  Are you really confident?  Wow, this is turning into an interview for me.  This is an unmasked thing.  Wait, there's Simba going by again.  We want him back.  This is all this stuff that you would have got to talk to Simba.  We want him back.  He's right there.  It's in bed.  Are you truly confident?  Well, I don't think...  I mean, it's not the type of thing  that you can really drop the ball, right?  I mean, the person shows up to do the interview. 
[02:28:00]  What's the worst thing that could happen?  It's not a good interview?  It's not like I was a fucking heart surgeon.  But you're a great interviewer.  Where did you get that from?  No, it was basically from working here, right?  You had to be a good interviewer  when you were doing Ron and Ron and all that.  No, we used to do just the opposite.  We used to fuck with people  that were good enough to do the show.  Yeah.  I mean, we would try to think it was funny  to make things uncomfortable 
[02:28:30]  and have it be bad.  It was actually working here  with Sidney Pollack.  I came in and I talked to him about a movie  and then he sent this fucking message back to me.  He's like, that's the best interview I did on the store.  And I'm like, all right.  Maybe that's another thing.  But you were meant to do this.  Did you know that?  No.  Only recently?  Yeah.  Just the last couple of years.  Wow, that's fucked up.  You should have interviewed Alan Arkin.  That fucking miserable lump.  When did...  So what went wrong there?  Nothing.  We just met him for a second, 
[02:29:00]  but he was like...  See, a lot of people,  you know, you got to fucking turn that.  But you also have to know  a lot of these guys are like doing 900 of these things  where the people are fucking terrible.  That's true.  And they're...  So they've got so many defenses up  by the time that they get to you.  We didn't...  No, I just met him for a picture.  Yeah.  Hello.  Yeah, we didn't have him.  But he was just like...  Who do you look up to  as far as people that interview?  I think Charlie Rose is...  Yeah, fucking good.  Oh, he's great. 
[02:29:30]  Fucking good.  I thought Larry King was good back in the day.  Well, Larry King had a long career before...  We make fun of him now, but he was...  But he had a long career before that even happened.  But Cavett was good.  Cavett was great, man.  I did a...  I had Cavett on.  We had him on.  Well, yeah, you sent your...  Somebody sent over a picture.  Which he didn't recognize you or him.  For some reason.  And I looked at the picture  and I didn't think it looked like either one of you.  And he's like, who's this?  And I go, this is Jim Norton.  I'm like, it doesn't look like this.  And he goes, but this doesn't look like me. 
[02:30:00]  Is this me?  He knew me when we met, though.  He was a Tough Crowd fan.  Yeah.  Like he liked my act from Tough Crowd.  But I'm telling you,  the fucking picture didn't look like you or him.  I don't know what happened that day.  Neither one of us are very attractive.  Let's be honest.  The Cavett's seen better days.  We had a blast with him.  Yeah, he's great.  And I did the on-mast with him and he was fucking...  Did you get the good version?  What do you mean by the good version?  Well, he's had some depression issues in his life.  Yeah, I liked that.  But he was up that day 
[02:30:30]  and he gave us a great interview.  We had a lot of fun with him.  I think he's a really witty, funny guy.  And you got to...  Since you like comedy, Jimmy,  the box set stuff that he has from the 60s...  I think I have that.  It's fucking...  So many great people.  He's interviewed fucking Hendrix.  He did a long one with Brando,  who was a very tough interview.  Not only that,  but when they left there,  Brando,  that was the day he knocked out  fucking Rangelia,  the paparazzi,  the first paparazzi.  And I honestly think  Cabot was behind it. 
[02:31:00]  He was like,  there's a fucking guy  who always takes pictures.  He's taking a picture.  Fucking Brando goes over  and, you know...  Locks him out.  Feels like I have to show off.  Broke the guy's fucking jaw.  Really?  Wow.  Did he get sued?  He must have...  Yeah, he got sued.  And the guy started...  You'll see these pictures  of him wearing a fucking football helmet.  But I had that guy on the show, too.  Ron Galeo?  Yeah.  Was he awful?  No, he was fucking great.  He's...  His stuff, actually,  from the 70s,  shows in galleries now.  The stuff that he did,  his paparazzi stuff,  because he used to be  outside of Studio 54. 
[02:31:30]  So you got all these, like,  Liza Minnelli as a junkie  laying around.  And the pictures are great.  Yeah, of course.  There's something about  those 70s shots  that are fucking fantastic.  Of course.  You got Jackie Kennedy, right?  Because their guard...  Jackie Kennedy is stopped.  Their guard was down, you're right.  Because their guard was down, Ronnie.  You don't see that often.  You get the Lindsay Lohan, of course,  but you know these big celebrities  are letting their guard down,  but they don't allow it  to be shown in public  where their picture could be taken.  People don't, even now,  even like with the Snooki, 
[02:32:00]  they still don't get as fucked up  as they used to.  People used to get  really fucking hammered  in this country.  And back then,  the paparazzi weren't a problem,  so you didn't realize  that everyone didn't have  a cell phone camera,  so that you could behave badly  in public and get away with it.  But now, it's like,  no matter what you do,  people are filming you.  They're right there.  Yeah.  It's so weird, too,  because those cell phone things  have changed performance altogether.  Like, rock shows  are now people  fucking with their cameras.  They're not even paying attention  to the show.  No, and when I'm, 
[02:32:30]  for me, when I'm at a show,  I feel like I'm seeing  a bunch of little monitors,  a little TV.  Yes.  I'm like, this sucks, man.  It's different.  Do you remember  when they would search you  for cameras?  Yeah.  You couldn't bring cameras.  They don't give a fuck  if you have a camera now  because they don't have to give up.  They cannot stop it.  The Pixel's got too good  on the phones.  Chester A. Arthur beard  is a suggestion  for Fez coming in.  Let's take a look  at that, Danny.  That's TankTM on Twitter.  Can we look at Chester A. Arthur?  Or do we go with  Walt Frazier?  It's exciting stuff for Fez  knowing that he's going to  take a new presidential look. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, that kind of looks  like a Fez.  It kind of looks like  Fez-y-like.  A little bit.  And I like the name Chester A.  Chester A.  It works, too.  Yeah.  That's an unusual beard.  That could work on Fez.  It's either that  or the Walt Frazier.  What do you think?  It's a modified Lemmy.  Yes.  But not bad.  Not bad.  I think Lemmy wears it  a little better.  Not bad, Chester.  If Fez is doing that,  he needs to wear the coat,  the whole fucking garb, though.  The whole nine yards.  And I think that he seriously  could make a lot of money 
[02:33:30]  as a Chester A. Arthur  fucking cover band.  Just going out there  doing the old shit.  Just walk around  in Times Square  with SpongeBob Squarepants  and get his picture taken  as Chester A. Arthur.  I guess he's got to do Chester  later in life.  Oh, you've got to get  the old school.  Where the chops  kind of hang off the jowls.  Well, here's the problem there.  For that, he's got to grow  full beard, I think,  and then shave down.  Shave the top half of the beard  and let the bottom  hit the collarbone.  But you know what's weird?  Out of all the things  that we've got,  people still remember him  from the Hitler mustache.  Well, of course.  Really? 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  Called an oldie but a goodie.  When he walked in  as Hitler that day,  we were frightened.  Well, he did baby Hitler.  Baby Hitler.  Look how happy he was.  But you know what's really bad  about the day he came in there  is the joy that was  in Anthony's fucking face.  Anthony was like a little kid  that saw fucking Santa Claus.  Like there's fucking stuff online  where you just see Anthony  just so fucking excited.  Like he knows it's not Hitler  but he wants it to be.  He wants to believe.  You know, he wants to believe.  Look how much heavier Fez was then.  He looks like... 
[02:34:30]  He's lost a few pounds.  How many heart attacks ago was that?  That's three heart attacks ago.  Okay, all right.  But it looks like  like he should be fucking  traveling with Stan Laurel.  Yeah.  Speaking of Ant,  he did tweet a picture  of him holding up a lot of cash.  He's bragging that he raped the casino.  Can we go back to that picture?  Yeah, I'm going to say it.  The Anthony picture.  And I want to...  I want you to try to figure out  how much money is in this bundle.  It's on his Twitter  if you want to check it out. 
[02:35:00]  So he's having a good time  on the cruise.  How much...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That is a stack of fucking hundreds.  Do you think it's hundreds  all the way through?  No.  There's no way, right?  No, he's a certain kind of rich.  That's $135.  100 on top, 35 ones.  That's a lot of cash.  And even some paper.  That's a lot of cash.  That's a lot of cash.  That's a lot of cash.  Looks like he had a good night.  10 grand, I bet.  Which is a game of choice.  But he's got two weeks now,  so he should stop now.  That ain't happening. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, you can't do that.  We don't have a fucking boat.  There's nothing else to do.  That's not happening.  He, um...  Blackjack.  Everyone knows.  That is gross.  Yeah.  A little Blackjack  and a little, um...  And a little, uh...  A little poker  when he wants to kill some animals.  Not on the poker  as much as he used to be, though.  No, he's Blackjack all in.  The, um...  This new girl  kind of is like  a Melinda cover band, though.  I like her.  That's like new Melinda.  They're friends, too.  Yeah, they're great friends.  He's got the Jerry Weintraub thing  going where everybody's all friends. 
[02:36:00]  You can't beat it.  Well, Jerry was a producer, right?  Yeah.  I met him when he was outside.  Really?  Norm MacDonald said he's like a legend.  He is...  He's...  We're talking 60 to 75,000  is, uh, an estimate.  Who's giving that estimate?  A few people that have...  You're going to give it?  A few people on Twitter  are looking at it, too,  and saying that's about 60 to 75.  Scott, well, think about it.  I mean, look,  if we're saying that they're all hundreds,  I mean, if you've seen  a $10,000 stack with a band on it,  you know, you can kind of estimate...  I have it.  You could fit about six of those in there.  But I don't know, see,  I would fucking believe 
[02:36:30]  any figure you told me.  If you told me I was $30,  I'd say, yeah,  it was a $3 million shirt.  I wouldn't fucking know the difference.  I have no comprehension either.  One inch is more than $10,000.  See, a lot of people are figuring it out.  Now, how do they...  Four inches...  If it's four inches of hundreds,  that's $180,000.  I'm telling you,  everyone's trying to figure out  how much that is.  All right, so now they're saying  at four inches of hundreds,  is that...  If that's all hundreds,  he's got...  Good.  That's $10,000 banded.  Okay.  That's a banded stack.  He's got at least...  Wait, go back.  Go back and forth a couple times. 
[02:37:00]  There's got to be six or seven of those.  Absolutely.  Six or seven is right.  Yeah.  All right, so he's pushing  maybe $70,000 in that stack.  That's not a bad estimate, right?  I think you're about right, Danny.  I say it's about...  I say $10,000.  Here's the thing.  $10,000.  I would...  He laughs at that  when he's gambling.  I mean, even looking...  I mean, obviously,  we know fucking ants,  so I wouldn't...  But I would kill a man  for that fucking stack.  But even just to have  that thing of coming home  and then dropping the stack down,  like, don't even ask me  where I got this.  That's always an exciting  fucking thing. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I can't wait  until the next picture  he tweets,  which is fucking Somalis  boarding his ship,  taking his money.  You know how happy  that would make me?  Well, where is this boat going?  Is this a trip to nowhere?  Yeah, it just kind of  wanders around.  Just around the fucking  island of Manhattan  over and over?  So far,  we're keeping track.  We're trying to get him  on the satellite phone.  He was in contact  with us yesterday.  He's hoping to maybe  do a little time with us.  But raped a casino,  swam at the dolphins,  and some pictures  with monkeys.  You ever do the dolphin thing,  Ronnie?  Not the fucking 
[02:38:00]  trained ones like that.  I hate the trained ones.  It's a crock of shit.  Swimming with dolphins came by  and just trying to grab them  and shit,  like in the regular water.  Why not?  But the trained ones,  no, I never.  It's a crock of shit.  They don't give a fuck  about you.  What, the dolphins?  There's the monkey picture.  Yeah, they just want the food.  The fish that's being  dangled behind you.  No, when I was down in Florida,  a couple people got raped  by dolphins, too.  A dolphin will fucking  rape a human being.  Would you take that?  Would you take a raping  by a dolphin just for the  experience, for the story?  No. 
[02:38:30]  No.  It would hurt.  Yeah, it would fucking hurt.  And they'd take you  down to the fucking bottom.  They'd take you to the bottom  and just fucking  That can't be fun.  It's going into the fucking sand.  In the sand.  No.  Yeah.  They let you up for a little air  and then they start  bringing you back down again.  Yeah, do they know  they don't want to fuck you?  They edge.  They want you to die.  They edge.  Dolphins are edging.  Yeah, they don't come immediately.  They could come  and they don't want to come that fast.  They just keep bringing you  up to the surface  for a quick breath.  Dolphins are badass, man.  They fucking attack sharks.  Yeah, they will.  Yeah, I think in the wild  that would be really scary.  Hey, I teased a Steve C story 
[02:39:00]  on the Sam show  that Ronnie does.  You do that show, too.  You do the beginning.  I do a little at the beginning.  You do the end.  And then there's something  that happens in the middle.  What is that?  What does he do in the middle?  He talks to Roland a lot  for some reason.  Sinbad's doing it with him today.  I think that's why  they had to rush Sinbad out.  Steve C is...  Some people are saying  that if Steve C  didn't get let go  by this company,  he would be dead today.  His condo.  Did you hear about his condo?  Who's got the whole story? 
[02:39:30]  Does Travis got it?  It was on the news,  but basically the condo  right next to the one  Steve owned  fucking blew up.  Wow.  And Steve's,  where he would have been living in,  is burnt to the ground  two months after he sold it.  Yeah, I think one person died.  One person died in which?  In Steve's?  I'm not 100% sure,  but I think...  You don't think Steve's  still tied up in that some way?  Like, I'm going to get even  with those people  who are living in my condo.  I think so.  From what I understand,  he sold it like a month ago.  A month ago,  and now the condo's  completely gone.  Yeah. 
[02:40:00]  That's pretty fucked up.  And he wouldn't have sold  if he still had the gig.  No, he'd still be here.  So, there you go.  Where is he now?  PA.  Yeah.  In the woods, though.  I think he's in the woods,  PA.  He's got a Scrapple factory.  He's doing very fucking good.  Yeah, he's doing very well.  That and Moonshine.  Yes.  So...  Big shoe fly pie eater.  It's fucking partying  with Amish people.  They're creepy sweet treats.  Fucking sugary nonsense.  You don't like the Amish?  You don't like Kenya. 
[02:40:30]  How can you?  I remember the cock bulge  of this Amish guy  I saw one time.  Yeah.  He was probably 17 or 18,  and I was working in Lancaster,  and they were out,  and he just had a gigantic cock bulge.  It just looked so weird  on an Amish guy  because his pants  were pulled up high  because of these suspenders.  Right.  It was really creepy.  Yeah, but from the inbreeding,  a lot of them have two dicks.  It's something they can't fucking...  You'll get a bulge  going in each direction.  Down each leg?  Yeah, well, because  they fuck their sisters.  It's all part of their thing.  Like the split tongue  that some of the kids are doing? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, you can't get around it,  and they have  the club for the dwarves.  Yeah.  Gotta watch out for that.  What do they call it?  Rumspringer?  There's the pictures  of Steve's condo on fire,  by the way.  Wow.  Yeah, and it was on the news  and everything.  We should have Steve  on the phone.  Funny.  I just hope he's not caught up  in this.  Foundry logo.  Yeah, it's flames once again.  Flames in Steve's life.  That's funny.  All right.  We got Wiki being a rock star.  Good.  We also got the story  that Jimmy tweeted about yesterday.  I don't know this one,  but you think he's the greatest  man alive. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, he's fantastic.  Oh, I know.  I mean the guy he hit.  Paraplegic grandfather  faces jail for whacking  his three-year-old granddaughter's  alleged molester  with a baseball bat.  Yeah, that fucking pesky old...  Pesky old fucking...  Do-gooder?  No, I think that guy's great, man.  The guy in the wheelchair  took a bat to the guy  who was going to molest  his fucking grandkid.  But how do you swing it  if he's fucking...  If he's paralyzed?  It doesn't say a lot  about the other guy.  He just got to swing level.  Oh, sorry, dude. 
[02:42:00]  Did he have to use his mouth  like that little breathing tube?  They do stuff like that.  No, no, he's not a quad.  He's power-up.  No, just power-up.  Yeah.  So it's just the legs?  Is that how it is?  Or one leg and one arm?  His arms are pretty much  not worth a shit,  but they were good enough  to swing that bat.  Because sometimes it'll happen  where it'll go just across  your left leg  and your right arm.  Oh, that's wonderful.  But then on the other side,  you're fine.  Yeah.  You're like a fucking starfish.  Thank you, God.  Thank you.  Thank you for this.  Like a fucking puppet.  Why are you telling him so?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't understand sometimes.  When the little kids get sick, 
[02:42:30]  it's like,  what do they do  to deserve this?  Are you a God guy, Ron?  No.  No, I'm not.  I just...  Spiritual guy?  Yeah, I'm a spiritual guy,  but I can't get...  Organized religion?  No way?  No.  But when it really comes down to it,  like all these people  get into religion  so that they could have  a certain amount of awe.  I already have that.  I already can't believe  how fucking great the world is.  I'm just like blown away.  By what is happening?  Yeah, by what?  I can just see them. 
[02:43:00]  They're like,  look, we have gravity,  we have air,  we have...  There's plenty to be happy about here.  I don't really even need to have it.  Just like,  I get it.  Thanks.  This is really great.  And if there's no more,  I don't, you know...  I had a good time.  I got more than I ever dreamed.  I got more than I ever dreamed.  And how scary could it be  if we all have to go through it?  If we're all going to die,  how scary could it be?  Have you ever been with anybody  when they died before?  Yeah.  So you know that there is a feeling  of something.  Yeah.  Something leaves.  Yeah.  Something leaves that room. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  And I've been with a few people  when they died  and like the fucking one moment  like they're a person  and the next moment you're like...  That's a mannequin.  It's a mannequin.  It turns into a mannequin.  I was there when my dad died.  It was...  Wow.  Wow.  I don't know if people should do that.  I don't know.  I think for me it was like one of...  I think being there  when someone's born  or when somebody's dying  are the two things in life  that make you think  there's something worth living for. 
[02:44:00]  But I agree with you.  The second they're a person  and when they're gone  it feels like  maybe they left the coat behind.  You don't get the feeling  that that's them.  That body is...  Yeah.  They're completely different  within seconds.  Yeah.  And you don't feel like...  I didn't feel like  I was looking at my daddy more  even though it was him  how I remembered him.  Right?  Yeah.  But it is certainly...  Now you had the feeling  that he literally left too, right?  Yeah.  And did you feel like 
[02:44:30]  kind of an up  and to the left  kind of a fucking pull?  Because I had this thing  each time I was with somebody  that I could feel  like something took place  and I don't know what it was.  Yeah.  I was too...  the emotions.  So I wish I could have  looked around a little more.  Yeah.  To kind of really take it in.  I can't say I didn't have that.  And I don't even have  any kind of afterlife belief.  Right.  But I felt energy  in that room.  Wow.  Unlike energy.  And I felt the same thing  when people were being born. 
[02:45:00]  There's a certain feeling  and I don't want to fucking...  because I'm not selling anything.  Right.  And I said I don't even know  if I have any beliefs after.  Right.  But I know what energy feels like.  Right.  And something takes place  when a person does.  The birth thing is bizarre.  Yeah.  All of a sudden my son popped.  I was like who are you?  Right.  Who are you?  But didn't he seem like  a person to you?  Immediately.  Didn't he feel like...  Yeah.  Immediately I'm like wait  you were inside...  Right.  Were you inside as a person?  Yeah.  It's the freakiest fucking thing. 
[02:45:30]  I...  And then I almost...  For a split second I was mad.  I'm like who are you?  Why are you here?  And then all of a sudden  it all comes together obviously  but that split second  it's the most bizarre thing.  It's so funny that you say that  because most people  don't admit that  and they'll just act like  there's this...  This is part of me  and I'm us.  Yeah.  All this thing that you  kind of get but you are  first of all  is like you know  your chick is kind of like  acting like an animal  for a while.  You know you're like  this isn't even like a...  You know what I mean?  Like talk about nature 
[02:46:00]  taking fucking place  you know.  So you're just kind of like  whoa.  I don't even know  if I like fucking being here.  But then  I remember  particularly  you know  both my kids  I was there  but my daughter's older  and when she was born  I thought  there ain't nothing  new about this person.  I mean she had  the expressions  and the personality  of somebody  who had been around before.  Yes.  And I  again  to take you back to it  I've never been  one of these past lives  person. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  You know  but I didn't feel  and I think again  that's why I don't feel  all that much of like  well this is mine  and I'm  Right.  They come in  this world  with something.  Absolutely.  You know  and it's like  kind of none of your business.  They're already  they're already something.  Right.  It's hard to explain.  No I totally get it.  So where were they  before this  is what I think.  Right.  Because this  my son came out  as a complete person.  Right.  Yes he's a baby  he's a newborn  but you see right through it. 
[02:47:00]  And I get  but so you said  you almost were offended.  I was mad at first.  And now what  what was it  that made you mad?  I was like  who are you?  Simple as that.  Who are you?  Like it was really  confusing to me.  Does that make sense?  No it makes  total sense.  But then when  and then when they  cut the cord  well I had to cut the cord  which I'm like  whatever  I didn't need to do that.  It was like  it was like  cutting through  like  it's horrible.  It's horrible.  It's almost like  they give a little kid  a job to do. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah exactly.  The father is such  a fucking appendage  to the whole thing.  And then they had  to bring him  excuse me  to the heat lamp  which is five feet away  and my wife's screaming  go with him!  Like something might happen  within those five feet.  And then  and then I kind of  like he was screaming  so I put my hand  on his chest  I never talked about this  and just kind of rocked him  and then that whole  who are you  went completely away  and then it becomes  you know what it is.  Yeah but  I do think  it's also  like important 
[02:48:00]  to acknowledge  that there is  a weirdness  that you don't feel  see like  in nature  this is  you would have been  killed by the mother  and child by now  and they would be  eating you  and you know  using your nutrients.  Yeah.  so you know  your use  was already done  absolutely  you know  you already passed  that way over  but I think  it's so fucking true  that everybody  will tell you  that this thing  is this beauty  and it is  but at the same time 
[02:48:30]  it's like  the most physical  like you know  the fucking one  like a David Lynch film  where you can start  to hate the human body  you know  after a while  you know  there's a strangeness  that takes place.  Now again  I kind of see  that as spiritual  it doesn't have  to just be  I don't see spiritual  as just being  enlightening.  Right.  I think the confusion  because there's no way  your little mind  can fucking pick up  on this  but how does somebody  come into 
[02:49:00]  a world  that you feel like  well I'm going to  make this little world  you got very little  to do with that.  I agree.  Whether you plan  on college  and all this shit  that fucking personality  shows up  right away.  and at most  at the most  you're a guide.  You can be a bad guy  or a good guy.  You can adjust a little bit  I think.  Yeah well you can just  But you're not  you're not going to  shape that person  a lot.  And again  what are they going to do?  They're going to  fucking snap  and go back  you know like  you can hold them down  because you're 
[02:49:30]  physically stronger  but after a while  no.  They're their own person.  Yeah.  Yeah it was  I was very very confused  for I don't know  now I don't remember anymore  but a couple minutes probably.  No I've  I know  that exact  bewilderment  that took place  of this is not  There was a strangeness  Yeah.  There was  who are you  I didn't feel like  You felt like you met a dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That changed though.  Yeah.  Because now you start  to adjust in it 
[02:50:00]  and you let it back down  but never let go  of that feeling  because that will keep you  from being  the asshole dad.  Right.  You know what I mean?  That you'll realize  that a huge part  of that fucking personality  is done without you.  You know?  Yeah I agree.  I understand that.  You know whatever genetics  great  but  you know  stop acting like  But this guy's saying  you're meeting him  for the first time  yeah he's a stranger  but no  but  the whole time  your wife's pregnant 
[02:50:30]  you're thinking  it's part of you  it's  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's going to come out  looking like you  or acting like you  or there's going to be  this connection  to you immediately  or some  Yeah it is a stranger  you're right in a way  dog shit  and literally is  a  Words of wisdom  Words of wisdom  dog shit sniffer  Words of wisdom  It's not only  it's a stranger  it's already a stranger  that your wife  kind of loves more than you  you know what I mean?  Yeah my monologue  gave me that lesson  thanks by the way  you know  you never love someone 
[02:51:00]  like you love your kid  and you're like  I'm like well great thanks  because I'm competing  for that love right now  so  Yeah you're on the outside  Thanks for setting me  straight on that  that the love for my son  will be way greater  than you ever have  with my daughter  Well it's definitely  it's like a  It's different  different kind of thing  but like  I sort of  knew that already  I didn't need to hear it  from my mother-in-law  who I get along with  by the way  I should add that  but  And she's also saying  that that's the  grandmother's  strongest love  like  and no matter 
[02:51:30]  where you go  men are always  like slightly confused  and you know  like we act like  certain things  like we belong there  but god  we're on the outside  We absolutely are  outside looking in  so I mean  that guy  Dog Shit Sniffer  broke it down  to make it very simple  that yeah  he's a stranger  but I don't know  I thought the connection  would be immediate  as soon as he  popped out  he turned too  turned and looked  right at me  Yeah  I think of the same  thing you were  there's a fucking you  well there's a turn 
[02:52:00]  that happens  when they're born  they come out like  this and then they  turn right toward you  right  it's like  it's like from a  sci-fi movie  and like  when my son was born  he was born  pissed  he was just  really  yeah  like he was born  like  his chest was coming  out  I was like  alien  and I'm like  oh easy man  easy  this is  everyone's ears  on your side  we had to chill  everything back down  again  but like  I got it  like I don't think  I would have wanted  to be born  it must have been  a much  a motherfucker  you know I mean  you know how much  you hate waking up 
[02:52:30]  in the morning  it must have been  so much worse  to be born  I'm so glad  we can't remember it  I would like to  remember being inside  they say how great  it is in there  it's heroin  that's what they say  they say it's  like being in  on heroin  my mother was smoking  Benson and Hedges  I'm sure it was a nightmare  my dad was  fucking her  it was awful  it was awful  now you have a  chronic cold  and cough  exactly  the bench in the Hedges  a little longer  that's because she  actually even  needed more 
[02:53:00]  needed a longer cigarette  she smoked 100  yeah  with the 120s  that's why I think  a lot of that stuff  is crap too  because our parents  were doing some crazy shit  when they were  giving birth to us  I had a sister  I was born with my mom  going through an electric shock  wow  imagine that  pregnant  and they're giving  the electric shock  and how's your sister  is like  she's fucked up  yeah  nah she's cool  she's fine  she's just like  constantly  fucking lightbulb  well who were they 
[02:53:30]  just  fucking  oh it was Kate Hudson  she was drinking some wine  while she was pregnant  and it fucking showed up  in all the newspapers  like it was awful  and you're like  that's nothing  all of our mothers  they didn't give a shit  second hand smoke  smoking themselves  drinking the whiskey  whatever  women drank harder shit  back then too  right  yeah  they didn't have  all the girl drinks  made up yet  well yeah  and not only that  but like  our moms used to put  like whiskey in our mouth  when we were teething  I didn't do that 
[02:54:00]  but the other night  we're out at a restaurant  I'm having a glass of wine  I dipped it  I'm like  give them a taste  and oh wow  the whole table  looked at me  like I was  out of my fucking mind  yeah you shouldn't do that  but it's  see my wife's younger  so you know  but like Ronnie's saying  that absolutely happened  what do they dip  the passies in  yeah they would do that  just put it in their thumb  and rub it back  a little bit  especially when they were teething  fuck the or gel  they would get the whiskey out  right  right always  numb it up  numb it up a little bit  but everything's turned around 
[02:54:30]  even Simbad saw it  Simbad  he's terrific  he would just walk by  is he still here  he was going  that wouldn't pick you up  beat the horn  when you're driving by  that was kind of funny  it was great  it was fucking funny as shit  it's true  when your dad  didn't  talk about people  they didn't feel any connection  with us  yeah  now you can't  hurry up  you're going to be late  that was great  you were left on your own  your own man  yeah  as a kid  not anymore  I remember my friend  now everything has to be  a play date  my friend Bruce  he lived in Marina Gardens 
[02:55:00]  and I lived in River Heights  apartments  we were very young  and I convinced him  to come up  and then one of my  older bully friends  was being nice to me  and then we just started  throwing berries  at Bruce  and we pelted him  with fucking berries  until he ran home crying  and he couldn't  understand why  I was hurting him  but it was so much  more fun  to hang out  with the bully  we threw berries  at Bruce Kenny  and that's only  because you couldn't  find any monkey balls  remember those  sticky fucking things  that would come out  you'd call them  I don't even know 
[02:55:30]  what their purpose is  I don't know either  they would stick to everything  you'd land that  into a kid's neck  and fucking  it was the greatest  fucking feeling  and then we literally  would have like  rock fights  against each other  with rocks  well we've talked  about it on our show  a lot  it started with  the dirt bombs  but when you ran  out of dirt bombs  there was too much  work trying to find  dirt bombs  like ah fuck  let's throw the rocks  now  but it seemed  so fucking funny  like holy shit  I just hit him  in the back  with a rock  fuck yeah 
[02:56:00]  everybody was laughing  their asses off  fuck yeah  I got one question  for you  we can move on  from it  maybe not though  maybe your kids  are old enough  that you skated  did you have to  hang out with like  parents that you  fucking hated  because the kids  got along  no I would  how'd you get  past that  because I know  I'm not gonna  be able to do that  I put the thing  out there  don't confuse  the fact that  we're friends  because our kids  are friends  so you would  just be polite  I'd put it out  there too  yeah right from  the beginning  and I even like  coached some  fucking little league  and stuff like that  and I told all the 
[02:56:30]  parents  doesn't mean  that we're friends  I'm gonna be like  that fucking cool  coach that all the  kids like  and don't get all  fired up about this  because none of your  kids are gonna be  pros anyway  you know  and they would come  like I think  I go look  at the very most  we're gonna  fucking make kids  who watch baseball  on TV  when they get older  and know what  they're  they'll understand  the game better  yeah  know what they're  pissed about  but none of them  can beat out the  Dominicans  your fucking kid  is just  okay for this league  and we're not  that good  he was born too white  but you gotta  you've gotta  fucking draw 
[02:57:00]  because  then that gets  into the thing  of um  you know  the kids' parents  start fucking around  with each other  you know  and you don't wanna  make the kids  all fucking part  you gotta keep  that fucking  you know  pushback  because you start  to hang out  with another couple  I don't wanna hang  out with assholes  just cause our  kids get along  yeah and then  you're fucking  drinking  you're looking  over and  your fucking  friends  your kid's  friend's mom  is kinda hot  and you're like  what am I  you know  and then you're  dragging that  all into their life  she's parting  her legs  like while no one  looks and you can  look up her skirt  yeah and she's 
[02:57:30]  been to a thing  of like  I need to look  sexy again  I have a fourth  grader  it's all  it's all  it's all so easy  to fucking fall into  I dated a few of those  sure you did  sure you do  and that becomes  like the  and that's like  fucking seriously  that's the low  hanging fruit  fucking A-Rod  everything's already  fucking laid out  for you there  there's so many  fucking landmines  right on  fuck  by the way  I can't believe 
[02:58:00]  that you guys  do this every day  you come in here  this early  it's so crazy  I feel really icky  yeah I think  I'm two days  behind you  I think I didn't  skate this one  like I thought  I did  I texted Dr. Steve  I don't know  what to take  it's like  literally when I  cough  it feels like  something sharp  is just being  jabbed up  into my chest  it really hurts  I don't think  you're gonna make  it dude  probably not  death would be  a merciful relief  we made it  to the end  of the show  I'm sure we did  we were professionals  we did it right  did you guys  stay with me  and Fez  for the rest of the day  just work all the way  through  just be like  the three amigos 
[02:58:30]  in Fez  the problem is  is the hour  in between  that complete  wasteland  called Sam Show  maybe I'll do  fucking breakfast  and come back  cause now I  don't feel  obligation  I'll give you a couple  no seriously  at some fucking point  I'm gonna call you  for a favor  no I'm gonna call  on you for a favor  and it's gonna be  one that you  don't wanna give me  like this one  like this  I was surprised  how early it showed up  I'm like  he might roll in  around eight  no  but because now  I know  I got this thing  hanging over your head  yeah  when Fez dies 
[02:59:00]  and I was like  what are we gonna do  with Ron  should we fucking  you know  no  remember that time  I was there  when Ant was on vacation  I'm gonna fucking  hold that up  that's the same thing  yeah it's the same  exact thing  alright I didn't know that  this is like  the biggest thing  that you could ever  owe someone  what you owe me  right now  it's fucking ridiculous  I feel like  I should write a check  yeah you can't  climb out underneath  this with money  I feel like  I feel like  I should write a check  you're gonna fucking  have to kill somebody  I might need you  to wax Sinbad  hey you wanna 
[02:59:30]  before we leave  hear Don Wicklund's band  yeah  I can't believe  you haven't heard this yet  what are they called  broadcast  oh because he works  in broadcasting  that's great  for the people  I can't believe  I even have to do this  but Don Wicklund  we made his life  a living hell  at XM  I certainly did  and I'm sure  you did in your own way  you just do it  differently than I do  well Wicklund's band  is called  The Straits  but straight  isn't quotes  Wicklund used to  talk about this 
[03:00:00]  where he would  sing in a band  on weekends  we were like  whatever  whatever you do  on your own time  is your thing  but then we finally  got some samples  of his music  and you know what  he pulls it off  Rod  yeah he's good  we were hoping  that we could beat him up  which song should we play  You Give Love  a Bad Name  Blue Collar Man  alright  Lights by Journey  perfect  whatever one you want  I could kill this  Eddie Trunk  would masturbate  to every one of these  doing this for Ronnie  Don Wicklund 
[03:00:30]  here he is on vocals  doing just 28 seconds  let's do this  Lights Journey  when the lights  go down  in the city  and the sunshine  turns on the bay  oh I wanna be there  yeah  in my city  oh  oh  oh  oh 
[03:01:00]  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh  good pipes  he pulls it off  I  seriously  he pulls it off  there's no  fucking way  there's no way  that I would be able  to sing Lights  in 2011  no offense to him  but it's 2011  move past it  yes  but did you see  there's a video online now  they're digging  they're digging Don Wicklund  what song is he singing  in this video  why doesn't Brother Joe  have his hands on him 
[03:01:30]  I don't know  why isn't he out  in one of the journey bands  yeah  I think Brother Joe's  got his hands  in some of those  journey bands  yeah he's got plenty of them  I bet you when he performs  he's a little too  flamboyant  I bet he gets very carried away  when he performs  the girls are loving it  look  they're in the front row  hands in the air  there see  he's prancing  alright that's  yeah  that was really  that's  but why does 
[03:02:00]  you know  why doesn't he take  some of that rock stardom  in his regular life  why isn't he doing a radio show  I don't know  why does he care about  other people  whether they have  what they want  yeah he should be  torn with this thing  he's got chicks  chicks are digging  that want to be with him  and by the way  these are the same women  that you're gonna  that are gonna have  the kids  that are playing  with your kids  the fourth graders  yeah that you're gonna  look over and go  you know what  she's seen better days  and maybe I can give her  a little pick me up here  and make her feel  better about herself  and Chris in Arkansas  saying we need 
[03:02:30]  Zycam  Jimmy  me and you  I thought they got rid of it  what's Zycam  not the nose one  I chewed the Zycam  but it's fucking  it's worthless  is that for the throat  it's just shit  I need something  from the fucking pharmacy  oh my god  Don's doing rock faces  into the camera  he's unbelievable  rock faces  he's unbelievable  you think he's  he's happening right there  yeah he is  in his mind  he's Mick Jagger right  someone said  we started the show  with Mick  and we ended with Wick  so Jordan  from Mick to Wick  anybody who's  sat through four hours 
[03:03:00]  of this is out  of their fucking minds  seriously  I can't believe  that people were up  that early  and you've got to  fix morning radio  because six o'clock  doesn't work  I want to go back  to seven  it worked for everybody  they didn't see a drop  off or none of that  I tried  they didn't  they didn't understand  I'm telling you  I took a cab here  and no one was on the road  and nobody was on the road  it cost me  I came across town  75 cents  to get here  just sped right  that's a cab ride  yeah 
[03:03:30]  it's because  they're in the suburbs  making their way  to the Mecca  that is New York City  okay  but for whatever reason  through Twitter  and all that  I feel like  50% of the people  actually listen  to the replay  than the live show  I've done the math  in my own head  you don't think  you think more people  listen to the replay  than 50%  I noticed this  I'd love to know  because then it would  probably help to  program this channel  and the things  that go into  making this channel  but when you don't know  I get more  you just shrug your shoulders 
[03:04:00]  I get more feedback  so you might be right  on the show  during the replay  it's weird too  because I'm like  oh yeah  they're hearing this  for the first time  there's three other  time zones  that are hearing it  no but that 3 to 7  my Twitter  people are talking  about the show  more than live  I think  because that's when  you know  everybody's always  loved you guys  in that time slot too  but here's the other  I'd go back  to that time slot  here you are  you did this whole show  today I know  she didn't go to the  phones once  that's  you know  why bother being live  what's the fucking  point of being live 
[03:04:30]  I'm trying to do  different stuff  I love it  there were some  good phone calls  I'm trying to like  get out of my  comfort zone  good  stay out of your  comfort zone  I'm trying  because it doesn't  fucking matter  I'm trying  like you know  there were some  great phone calls  coming in  but like if you  watch a tonight show  are you sitting  there screaming  it's not live  you don't care  that it was  three hours earlier  why couldn't you  do this show  the night before  do it every once  in a while  do it at midnight  run it live then  and then boom  when you feel it  yeah rerun that  in the morning  but get out  when do you feel 
[03:05:00]  the best during the  day because that's  when you should do  the show  yeah I would do  it at night  I would do a night  show was always  so why don't you  for me the funnest  fucking thing  you're telling me  well right now  we're following this  thing but since I  got grand jury  I might be doing  that anyway  really  yeah  you got it  they fucking  you don't know  anybody  dude you know  how fucking  I didn't even  have to go down  this time  for grand jury  or regular jury  regular  grand jury  they don't let  go  they don't fuck  around with you  no  and this  I've fucking  kept them at bay  for four years  now  and the last 
[03:05:30]  one I got  had to go  in front of  the judge  and then I  said to him  well wait  no I want to  fuck you know  because I got  the thing  if you can get  30 days  or a thousand  dollar fine  and I go  wait you don't  understand  I want to be  on the jury  I'm fucking  trying to  I've been  fucking calling  you guys  for four years  just start  lying  acting like  a crazy  person  like a kid  again  I'm like  please  put me  on a grand  jury  as soon  as you  can  wow  I want to  get out  of this  situation  I'm in  a little  break  right  yeah  I know  I'm just  fucking  your reverse  psychology  blew up  in your face  yeah right  just whatever  I need to do 
[03:06:00]  you might be  on a case  no it's a grand  jury case  it's fucking  nothing  you just got  to sit there  and go  yes that  should be  a case  yes  oh really  yeah  I'm not  going to get  fucking  son of  Sam 2  right  I would  love to  that Long  Island  murderer  that they  got the  serial killer  out there  yeah  he's a good  one  we're up  to eight  and they're  looking for  the whole  time  they're  looking for  the one  they haven't  found her  yet  so it's  at least  nine  and that's  that's  that area  that we  all know  if you're  on Long  that's all  the beaches  we all go  to down  in that  area  it looks  like Billy  Staples  fat guy  is somewhat 
[03:06:30]  caught up  in this  one way  or another  I think  so too  I think  we all  had a  person  that popped  up in our  head  going  where's  he been  lately  crazed  but the  weird thing  about it  is like  it doesn't  get national  news  anymore  nine  fucking  serial  cameras  that would  have been  a big  story  it's  ten  Bundy  I know  nine's  a big  number  Jimmy  knows  everything  about  serial  I know  a decent  amount  you always  downplay  it  but no  one  has  beaten  you  his  knowledge  on serial  killers  is  ridiculous  they  kill  for  sport  now 
[03:07:00]  when I  did radio  in Florida  I used to  get fucking  mail  it wasn't even  email  it was mail  from serial  killers  all the time  one of them  I can't think  of he killed  a bunch  of people  in  well mass  murders  I used to  get mail  from  and  here's the  weird thing  about them  Jimmy  they always  draw pictures  on their  letters  they don't  just  write  they always  use  different  color pens  and at  the fucking  end  I'm not  making this  up  they always  say  play more  Aussie  every  I swear  to God 
[03:07:30]  because I  was on a  rock station  and they  would do  the same  shit  but they  always  fucking  they  one  fucking  regular  note  is enough  they change  it up  there's a  drawing  there's  fucking  they're  trying to  tell you  something  there's  fucking  weird  hidden  messages  they're  very  needy  as much  as they're  murderers  they're  needy  yeah  well  they're  never  as  brilliant  as  you  want  you  know  there's  no  silence  in  lambs  they're  always  fucking  half  retards  like any  other  fucking  listener  think in  there  that  guy  yeah  can I plug  something  before we go 
[03:08:00]  my pre-sales  on sale  yeah  if you make it  I hope so  the anti-social  network  I mean I'm in  Columbus this  weekend but  Friday May 13th  Washington DC  that's on sale  Wednesday June  15th with the  opening night of  the Chicago  festival  it's myself  Brewer  Baron  it's on sale  can I go to  that  what day is  that  it's a  Wednesday  night but  it's the  opening night  of the festival  that fucked up  a week of  radio  TBS is  giving us a lot  of promotion  fuck  and I'm doing  Vegas we're  doing July  3rd  because we  don't want  to compete  with UFC  the 2nd  sure  tickets go  on sale  this weekend  but the

[03:09:00]  with Ronnie  B  but we'll  try tomorrow  we'll try  hey  question for  E-Rock  when was  the last time  we played  the Freebird  story  jeez  long time  we gotta  fit that  in the  10 o'clock  hour  which means  less Sam  no offense  thank god  thank god  it's one of  my favorite  radio stories  ever  Ronnie told  it on our  show  you're too  kind  no I'm  not joking  that that  fucking thing  makes me  fucking  howl  one day  we gotta  go  I'll do  it on  your show  whatever  we gotta  just do  all radio  stories  I think  that would  we gotta  even get 
[03:09:30]  some more  radio guys  in here  we'll do  a panel  who would  you bring  in for  that  it'll be  me  and you  and I  think  the cuz  the cuz  just old  school radio  stories  one after  another  because when  I yell  and scream  bitch  I understand  they don't  want to hear  that but  when you  know  where you  were  with this  whole thing  and where  we are  today  it's  really  frustrating  and I'm  trying not  to express  that as  much on  the air 
[03:10:00]  but it's  frustrating  you never  even saw  salespeople  when me  and Ronnie  started  I think  we started  about the  same time  too  well the other  thing is  you're a real  broadcaster  I never was  a real  broadcaster  but you're  the real  deal  and it's  so much  more difficult  than most  people know  to be able  to pull  that off  I don't  like being  a real  broadcaster  though  it's  fucking  hard  I'm  trying to  I'm literally  trying to  step out  of that  I'm trying  I've been  trying for  the last year  slow process  put Jimmy  over in that  seat  let Jimmy  fucking 
[03:10:30]  yeah you  do this  I do that  I've been  wanting  a fucking  sound machine  I think we  should experiment  with it  even if it's  only for a  week  we get some  fun moments  out of it  how about  tomorrow  you sit  with the  sound machine  I have to  bring my own  sounds in  so it's  different  how long  is that  free bird  story  we're looking  for it  I don't  have it  yet  Sam what  do we  got on  the 10  o'clock  hour  with Ron  we got  a whole  are you  staying  for the  whole  10  okay  I would  hope so  you need  a little  rest  I think  Fez is  going to  surprise me  with breakfast  I just 
[03:11:00]  have a  feeling  you think  Fez is  really nervous  right now  going fuck  Roddy might  give me the  stick today  he's got  the stick  today  what does  he do  to make  sure you  stay for  the four  hours  he's  going to  be very  very funny  he's  going to  be on  top  of it  I just  feel  good  about  today  the last  time he  did  characters  they were  legitimately  funny  he does  his fucking  legitimately  he's funny  I heard  the characters  over the  weekend  hysterical  man  and I  laughed  very hard 
[03:11:30]  that's all  I meant  but everything  he does  is funny  well not  when it's  talking about  the sad  stuff  that's not  supposed to  be funny  it's on  purpose  that he's  not being  funny  but he's  never  accidentally  funny  no I know  I'm not  saying it  was an  accident  I'm  saying he's  skilled  four hours  I'm probably  a little  cranky  I'm trying  to give him  a compliment  Jimmy even  left  he's done  so what  are you  doing  with the  10 o'clock  hour  we're gonna  we got  Jimmy out  of here  there was  so much  stuff coming  out of him  Sinbad didn't 
[03:12:00]  have to leave  Sinbad wanted  out  he's fucking  texting  his fucking  people  yeah we're  gonna play  meatloaf  we're looking  for the  free bird  bit  I can't  believe that's  not in our  system  I love  that story  if we  will make  every attempt  to play  today  if not  today  it'll  definitely  be on  tomorrow  what meatloaf  story  when he  was in  when he  was in  yeah  all right  in reference  to what we  talked about  earlier  that's all  it takes  we've  mentioned  someone  and then  we pull  audio  with that  guy  yeah  I mean  you talked 
[03:12:30]  about him  being on  the show  and so  it's like  the people  at home  are like  what do  you mean  I never  heard that  who's the person  who grabs it  E-Rock  great stuff  E-Rock  and then E-Rock  also was grabbing  great music  for everything  now is this  the beginning  of your show  now  technically  I wouldn't  think so  we've had  that discussion  but I don't  think my show  starts until  this show  ends  and I mean  this is still  Opie's show  because you want  the attention  on you  we have to  turn the  spotlights on  for you  and everything  it's a different  show  one would have  to end  for the other  to begin  all of a sudden  he sits in 
[03:13:00]  this seat  and it's a lot  brighter over  here  you live in  a fucking  world of  imagination  son  you really  do  first of all  two crazy  fucking things  one  you and Dave  have a shot  because there's  no chemistry  between you  I feel like  there is  we bring  it's a yin  and a yang  me and Dave  which one  is the fucking  which one  is Dave  yin or yang  uh yang  then put more  yang in that  fucking show  I think there's  enough yang  there's a good  amount  it's equal  to yin  and yang  yeah  fucking Dave  is hysterical  I think Dave  is very funny  as well  you miss Dave 
[03:13:30]  on your show  Rob  I miss Dave  every day  of my life  I miss Dave  just coming in  and saying  something to me  about baseball  or guns and  roses  well he does it  on Saturdays  he's still on  the guns and  roses thing  he loves guns  and roses  so much  did you tell  him that I  I text him  that when I  went to Eddie  Trunk's party  by the way  we all felt bad  that you went  there  he really thought  I was going  to show  yeah he did  and he's like  he really thought  this time  yeah as he's  thanking everybody  he's like  is Opie here  he's looking  around  he's really sad 
[03:14:00]  did he at least  say I was in  the bathroom  but uh  bumblefoot  was there  bumblefoot  and comes over  and goes  I love the station  listen to you guys  all the time  and I'm like  Dave would have  loved this  this would have  been the greatest  thing for Dave  why wasn't he there  Eddie Trunk  didn't invite Dave  no  well Dave was  at the stroke show  that night  oh right  and then  the following night  I had James  Khan for you guys  that's who it was  I shouldn't have  even said  well you guys  weren't in  because I'm doing  something more  of that movie  is James  is he coming back 
[03:14:30]  no he was just  in for that weekend  but I was going to  drop into your show  with James Khan  well we weren't  on the air  you know if you do  once a week  you've got to be  here every  I think so too  how do you take  a week off  we weren't allowed  to be on the air  they got in trouble  I didn't know  any of this  I thought you did  I tried to tell you  on the after show  we weren't allowed  to be on the air  see they got in trouble  because they have  to run their own show  so when they're  running their own show  and trying to focus  on being on the air  meaning they have  to push the buttons  and make sure  everything turns out  right in the back there 
[03:15:00]  they didn't do it right  so they got in trouble  and they had to take a week  but you're not going  to get better  by doing it less  you should have  made a hundred more shows  I didn't pick the punishment  you don't get better  I don't want you  to get better  at running that board  so you're going  to take off a week  no  what people don't understand  Dave has to start  the show  in basically engineering  make sure everything  is sounding good  then run in here  to do the show  with Sam  and then run back  when it's time for breaks  and then when it fucks up  like it did  it's Dave's problem  well yeah  we don't do the show 
[03:15:30]  in the same room  that really doesn't  make sense to me  does he come over here  and do the show  where you guys  don't even look  at each other  well no  we start the show  in two separate rooms  and then Dave joins  that's what I said  and then he comes  running in here  when he feels  like everything's set  yeah  see that's someone else's  job that they don't  feel like paying for  yeah but they don't  even pay both the hosts  so how are they  going to pay  like a staff  like I said  who gets paid  well Dave is a  part time employee  so he would get paid  since I'm salaried  that's because he's  the fucking  seriously  he's the meat  it's not like  he gets paid a lot  it's fucking Dave 
[03:16:00]  now is there a reason  that I don't get  invited in when Ant's here  is like Ant has to  fucking go away  before Ronnie B  we'd love for you  to step in  I've been wanting  to just  I feel like I'm  bothering you  no no  I want you to do  the show with  yeah me and Ant  would be great  don't be like that  plus every time we  pitch you as a guest  Ant says no way  now I'm here  that's what's in  the back of my head  next time Jimmy's out  I'll put the invite out  we'll see if you show  I never know if you  will show  I didn't think you  were showing today  I thought you might 
[03:16:30]  do like 845  let me tell you  something  you were here  literally at the  start of the show  think of this as  something you could  never repay  something  and then we're  also putting together  the broadcaster's  corner  where we also  do broadcaster's  corner  yes  but we got to  pick the people  I really want to  do this  you need bitter  radio guys  the problem is  that you've made  so many people  angry over the years  they might not  want to do the show  with us  I've been working  it out  do you have friends 
[03:17:00]  I'm this close  to talking to Howard  about some things  oh gosh  I'm this close  oh god  I've been working it  I've been working it  this close  do you believe him  he has been  putting it out there  me and Ronnie  the limo guy  are like this  at this point  I figure if I get  to Ronnie  that's broadcaster's  corner  we'll have  broadcaster's  corner  Ronnie  the limo guy  who would you have  it really runs down  I'm trying to think  you would be perfect  trying to think  it has to be someone 
[03:17:30]  that's been through  the fucking war  well you know  maybe we'll  you know  believe it or not  believe it or not  Don from Don and Mike  oh god  he's been through the war  I don't know where we are  I buried that fucking  bullshit with him  let me tell you something  this is a true story  I talk about great  broadcasters  Don Geronimo  is a terrific  fucking broadcaster  and knows more  about radio  than most  people  I would agree  and I don't think  there's a  and this is very 
[03:18:00]  difficult  I don't think  there's a  format that  Don Geronimo  couldn't go into  whether it was  sports  classic rock  hit music  hit music  you know  when it was current  top 40  classic rock  so  and  there  always lies a problem  a guy like him  who's he gonna  you know  who could be his boss  you know  no one  that's the problem  the guys that don't  get in and work  that kind of stuff  don't know that  but the real radio guys  can't have bosses 
[03:18:30]  no you can't  but in some way  I'm sorry to those guys  they try every day  but they just can't  but wouldn't it be great  if the real radio guys  could fucking  be involved  with the younger guys  they're coming up  and you know  you wouldn't just have  Sam floundering around  with Dave  you know  like we think  it's fucking funny  that they have a train wreck  of a shit show  but what if there were people  to actually help  to train them  yeah  show them the way  because there's not a  broadcaster on the show  Dave is a very funny guy  you're a nice person 
[03:19:00]  and obviously  Opie's fond of you  but if Opie's pissed  at you one day  you'd never work again  you don't think  I have potential  it's over  you have not  picked up one skill  from the ONA show  that you can transfer  out into the real world  but I got a whole bunch  of shows now  that's the problem  wait  too many shows  too many shows  you're not focusing  yeah you're not focusing  you don't care  there's no risk  I care very much  and I'm multi-formatted  the one hits one too  the only way you make it  you gotta have that risk  of fucking completely 
[03:19:30]  being homeless  if it doesn't work out  see if it doesn't work out  with us  then you move over  to the hit music guys  and if that doesn't work out  then you move over  to I don't know  probably  yeah see it ends there  so I could go homeless  no but you still got  you gotta get rid  of your hit music show  yeah but this show  how long is this show  gonna be out of the air  and you gotta stop  being on our show  and you gotta stop  at the 10 o'clock hour  so just do special delivery  and if you believe in Dave  then that's it  and you gotta move  to a tiny little town 
[03:20:00]  and be miserable  on holidays  that doesn't sound  like something I do  none of you guys  ever wanna go back  and do it the right way  they all think  they're you know  oh I'm in New York  no you're not  you're not  you have to leave New York  and then try to get back here  then come back to New York  that's how it works  I'll go to LA  but I don't think  I'm gonna leave  a major city  oh boy you're in trouble  you find a place like LA  and start small like that  like that  so crazy  see I was born  and raised in Long Island  in the shadow  of the biggest radio market  and I had to 
[03:20:30]  fucking move around  for 20 years  to get back here  see that's your problem  yeah but you already  let me in  not really  no you're not in  no you're not in  that's what we're trying to say  but I know people  we're not even joking actually  until you carry your own water  it doesn't fucking  you have to like  all of a sudden  get that call  from that small  that PD  from a small fucking market  Des Moines is a good one  and let me tell you something  Iowa  I think that you would end up  liking that more  than what you guys  are doing now  that you would go in  and be the morning show  in some small fucking town  and just kill it 
[03:21:00]  and just kill it  and be meeting people  at the fucking Fridays  on you know  on Friday night  doing some kind of special  and giving out t-shirts  and you guys would start  and feel yourself like  holy shit  we're so much better  than we were  and then all of a sudden  the Providence PD calls you  and you're like  holy shit  now I'm going to Providence  you need to believe it  we're going to rock that town  yep  yeah but there's nothing like  the radio isn't doing that anymore  nobody moves around anymore  you could do it  you could do it  bring it back old school  yes  do it the right way  quit now 
[03:21:30]  it's wide open right now  I wasn't happier  when I was with Scorch  in Syracuse  and that's a very small market  but it wasn't your show  you've never had it yourself  it's true  that's what you need  and you need that connection  with your listeners  just like when you went out  to that thing the other night  you guys were disconnected  right  you guys didn't understand  why the people showed up  at that video thing  you know  Dave  yeah  because you didn't have  your own crowd  to come out there  and fucking be like  yes  we wake up with you 
[03:22:00]  thank you  there were some  special delivery fans there  you're not getting  the real point  you want to come  fucking driving up  and it's 6 o'clock  in the morning  and there's 10,000 people  going fucking crazy  yeah but that's not  going to happen in Des Moines  no it's going to  fucking happen for you  in Des Moines  in Des Moines yes  you can fucking do it  you know what  I don't know if this is  going to bore people  but I was in my  comfort zone  when I was working  sort of under  Brother Wheeze  in Rochester  and I felt like  I could have  stayed there forever  and I was talking  to some old school  radio guys  they laughed at me  I'm like this is great  I can live here 
[03:22:30]  and do radio  they laughed  like you're not staying  in Rochester  you're going to be  in a million fucking  places before you  figure out where  home is  and then I took  and I was the  jack of all trades  at that station  I did a little  production  I did traffic  and weather  because it got me  on the air  helped Wheeze  with mornings  a little bit  nothing that he  you know  that he needed  my help with  and then I did  I was the weekend  warrior  and then what happened  was the GM  left there  and moved to Buffalo  to start a new  rock station  fucking called me  I didn't want to 
[03:23:00]  leave my comfort zone  and I went to do  overnights  and I officially  had my own show  finally  and then the rest  is history  but I'm jack of all  trading here right now  that's what I'm saying  and that's what  Ronnie's saying  but you gotta like  you have to leave that  to officially get  your own show  full time  you gotta go and do it  you've got it  you've seen  Ope do his show  enough  you've seen Anthony  you've been around  you know what's happening  you guys  do you want to do it  with Dave  yeah  then you guys  gotta look at Dave  kids 
[03:23:30]  and say like this  you're gonna go  do at least  15 new schools  but I  I don't think  that there's a  talk radio market  Dave and me  could fit into  you never know  what are you  seriously  do you think  any business  ever wants  new fucking people  you gotta make it  happen  you gotta turn it  around  what are you  looking for  a gift  why would  somebody give you  a gift  you gotta make  it fucking  happen dude  but I'm trying  to make it  happen on satellite  radio  because there's  no talk market  left in terrestrial  this
