<pre> 1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York. That's the latest from Sugar Ray.  Song called Every Morning. That's a cool song.  I'm proud to say the Rock of New York coming out of that song.  Kind of changing the sound a little, Sugar Ray, remember?  Uh, yeah.  For Mean Machines?  Yeah.  Well, Sugar Ray realized they could make a lot of money writing hit songs instead of in-your-face rock.  Right.  So.  And that's what they're doing.  Well, good afternoon, Opie.  How are you?  Very good. How are you doing? 
[00:30]
 I'm all bandaged.  I see.  Opie had a little accident prior to showtime today.  Well, it freaked you out. It freaked everyone out.  It didn't really hurt, but a lot of people could relate to this.  Really freaked me out. It kind of gave me the heebie-jeebies.  That's what I mean.  I got the heebie-jeebies. We were looking through the...  Well, our pal Ralph DeTour gave us the latest...  Sports Illustrated Slutsuit Calendar.  And I got so excited to get to this.  And I ripped off the plastic and I was trying to open it up and... 
[01:00]
 Oh, God.  He puts his finger in between the little pages to open up the seal.  Well, I didn't realize there was razor sharp cardboard in the middle of the calendar.  Just sliced my finger bad.  That's nothing worse. Nothing worse than paper cuts.  And everyone in the room just went...  Because they just know what happened.  I thought the song was going to stop because you threw the calendar onto the board.  Ran out of the room, but your finger was still there.  Oh, the blood is just pouring out of this thing. 
[01:30]
 It was a good size cut.  Pretty good. Good paper cut.  But I'm bandaged up and ready to go here.  All right. Good. Good for you.  Wow. We have a lot to talk about today.  Yeah, we do. We've got a couple of feedbacks, too.  This guy Joe from Bayonne says his dad is going to get the pipe tomorrow.  Rick, we got the pipe saw and we got to play for that guy.  Rick's finding it.  Of course, we haven't spoken about the pipe in quite a while.  When a guy reaches a certain age, the doctor recommends he gets the pipe. 
[02:00]
 The pipe.  A colonoscopy and they take this periscope and shove it in you.  Kind of take a peek around, make sure everything's hunky dory.  Yeah, we all have a fear of the pipe.  And there's a conflict on what age you should get the pipe.  I'm here in 50.  Some people say 40 if you have problems in your family.  Charlton Heston on Larry King the other night,  because he's been suffering with prostate cancer. 
[02:30]
 I get the pipe whenever I can.  Damn you, pipe.  Damn the pipe.  He says when you're pushing 50, you should start getting the pipe.  Pushing 50.  And most guys are completely horrified about going to the doctor and getting the pipe.  Doctor held the pipe like Moses held his mighty staff and parted my legs  as if it was a red sea.  You want to play the pipe song for this poor guy's free. 
[03:00]
 Free my prostate from this evil lord.  Damn you to hell.  Yeah, so we have a pipe song my brother wrote.  Charlton Heston's got prostate cancer.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  He's just getting over it though.  It looks like he's going to be okay.  I'm going to be fine.  Damn my prostate to hell.  Get this cancerous prostate out of me, you damn dirty ape. 
[03:30]
 Speaking of apes, I know we'll see that for later.  Yeah, it's a mid-show break.  Oops, sorry, I forgot we're on the radio.  Never mind.  Yeah, my brother came up with a little pipe giddy.  And this just goes out to the people that have to get the pipe.  Well, it's dedicated to that guy.  What's his name again?  Joe from Bayonne.  His father is getting the pipe tomorrow.  So we'll play the pipe song.  This is for Joe's father.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York rush for moving pictures. 
[04:00]
 It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, is it true we have an Opie and Anthony chat room now, Anthony?  Yes.  Yes, if you go to the NEW website, click on our pictures.  Yeah.  And you'll see a little link for a chat room.  Hmm.  You go in there and you can chat with fellow fans.  Well, I think there's one guy in there right now.  Well, that makes perfect sense.  He called them and goes, hey, talk about your chat room.  I want to talk to someone.  I'm going to have to pop in there.  Well, we've been trying to get this going for the last few weeks, 
[04:30]
 and I think it's finally up and running.  Yeah, this is the first time we're talking about it on our show.  So yeah, I'll have to pop in here.  Let me get over there.  Yeah, so why don't you pop in right now?  I will.  OK, I'll do that.  And if you're online right now, pop in.  Do us a favor.  Tell us how it's working.  All right, we can use your feedback on this.  Yes.  We're trying to give you something a little different with our radio show.  More interactive.  We have the instant feedback.  We do have the phone lines.  We have the fax machine.  And now we have a chat room.  We let you become part of the show. 
[05:00]
 We try.  You know, speaking of which, someone on the email, I think it was,  or was it Jennifer, somebody, they were trying to figure out  what was the first sitcom on TV that had the couples sleeping in the same bed?  The first show.  Where the characters, the husband and wife.  Yeah, like in I Love Lucy, they had separate beds and they were married.  When did they finally break that barrier? 
[05:30]
 I can only go as far back as the Brady Bunch.  It was 68.  Brady Bunch was 68.  Someone had to do it before that, right?  I would think so.  Yeah.  Any guesses?  Dick Van Dyke show.  They were in separate beds, right?  Separate beds, right?  You're all the more a petri.  Huh?  Well, that's a good question.  So we'll throw that out there today.  It's a simple little stupid question.  And both.  What?  Monsters monsters.  Was that a bed they slept in? 
[06:00]
 Don't they sleep on top of a spot?  I don't know.  Yeah, wait a minute.  The monsters and maybe.  Now we're going as far back as the monsters.  When was that show on TV?  Like mid sixties.  It started.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Phones are going crazy.  So we'll get an answer on that.  Yeah, someone will come over there.  Something stupid.  I know.  But we need the answer.  You know, are you in the chat room?  Right.  Yeah.  It's taking time.  Yeah.  Okay.  I know how it is.  All right.  Next time we talk, we'll be checking out what you guys are saying in the chat room to see if it's working. 
[06:30]
 Okay.  All right.  The Rock of New York 1027 W.A.W.  Lenny Kravitz fly away and fog hat before that.  I just want to make love to you.  We had that one crank to the studio.  Yeah.  Brought back a little bit of memory for us.  Rock.  Get them guitars in there.  Yeah.  It was just a jam.  Yeah.  I love songs like that.  Remember when fog hat started torn in the early nineties again?  Kind of like a reunion tour.  Oh, yeah.  And they were nicknamed fake hat because it'd go see them and the lead guitarist was like 23 years old. 
[07:00]
 Oh, wow.  I got an age too.  Hey, wait a minute.  This isn't fog hat.  I hate when bands do that in general.  Yeah.  Like you go see one of your, you know, your old bands and stuff and it turns out that it's not even the lead singer anymore.  Like Journey did that over the summer.  Torn without Steve Perry.  That's ridiculous.  Or then you find out it's like the roadie is the only only member of the new band that has any connection to the actual band. 
[07:30]
 The actual roadie.  The actual roadie.  The actual drum tech.  Right.  Because the band is brand new.  Yeah.  Ridiculous.  We got a guy on the line who hasn't answered that stupid trivia question.  Oh, okay.  We kind of stopped our whole radio show for Jennifer down the hall.  She comes in wondering, yeah, who was the first television couple to sleep in one bed?  And the furthest back a week ago was Brady Bunch.  Yeah.  But it had to be before that. 
[08:00]
 Hi, Andy W.  An answer to your question about the separate beds.  It's Ozzie and Harriet and you've got to be right because it was a Jeopardy question.  And that was the answer.  Ozzie and Harriet, I got it wrong.  You know, I got, I got to go with you on that one.  I believe it.  If Jeopardy says it, it's got to be right.  That's right.  All right guys.  I got to go with you there.  What is Ozzie and Harriet?  What is Ozzie and Harriet?  Who were Ozzie and Harriet?  Thank you.  Be good.  Bye.  I'm the answer.  I've never watched Ozzie and Harriet at all.  I did years ago. 
[08:30]
 Is it a good one?  No, it's kind of stupid.  What about June and Ward Cleaver?  They never showed any bedroom scenes.  Yeah.  But she always used to say stuff like, you know,  that old gag,  Ward, weren't you a little rough on the beaver last night?  You know.  So you're applying that that show was explicit.  Well, that they had to be sleeping in the same bed.  Yeah.  If he was, you know, giving any kind of discipline to the beaver, 
[09:00]
 maybe that old gag, that old ploy, that old beaver gag.  Remember that?  The beaver.  We're retarded.  Have we gotten any facts today, Rick?  No.  No one wants to talk to us today.  Okay, that's great.  Thank you.  Thanks for the support.  Here every day trying to pump out new material and you guys don't care.  Appreciate it.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Okay.  Facts line is 212-957-WNEW. 
[09:30]
 We got to talk about Clinton and the NBA strike and whatever else you want to talk.  The Rock of New York, 1027-WNEW.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  Facts line, 212-957-WNEW.  Hey guys, because of that scumbag Mickey Rooney,  my wife will not give me my Tuesday night hummers anymore.  You see, my wife and I watched Bill yesterday.  Oh, no.  I could not stop laughing and she did not appreciate it very much and swore off my  Tuesday night hummers. 
[10:00]
 What do I do?  Joe from the courthouse, the guy who got in trouble for playing the Special Olympics song.  We're getting the guy screwed.  We warned everyone.  I know.  We told you guys to rent Bill the old movie with Mickey Rooney from I think 1981.  Bill Paxson is in it.  No, not Bill.  No, it's Dennis Quaid.  Dennis Quaid is in it.  And Mickey Rooney plays Bill, an old retarded guy.  But you don't want the sequel.  You don't want that one.  You just want the one Bill.  Bill.  I saw it.  I can totally relate to this guy. 
[10:30]
 The first time I saw it was on TV.  And I was sitting in the living room with my girlfriend at the time, this girl Lisa.  And she's crying at this movie because Bill, it's so sad.  Oh my God.  And I'm roaring laughing.  I couldn't stop laughing.  It's not a comedy.  It's supposed to be a drama.  He's got this bad toupee on his head.  He's like, I'm a regular good man with regular good hair.  And I got good teeth too.  Oh boy.  They hire him at the school to make coffee at the coffee shop. 
[11:00]
 Wild Bill's coffee shop, boy.  Oh boy, I make the good coffee now.  Oh boy.  My favorite scene still is the chicken scene.  Dennis Quaid takes him over his parents' house.  His parents that live in Connecticut.  They're like an upper middle class family and they do everything perfect.  Dennis Quaid comes over and is like, and mom, dad, this is Bill.  And they're like, oh, hello, Bill.  They're horrified by him.  Hi there, Bill. 
[11:30]
 Where's the chicken?  He sits down, starts mauling the entire platter of chicken and piling it on his plate.  His greasy little.  His greasy little.  Yeah, he's got like these little midget Vienna sausage looking fidget fingers.  Oh boy, I like chicken.  And they're telling him, Bill, stop.  Bill, relax.  Stop, no more.  Oh boy.  And then Dennis Quaid yells at him, Bill.  And he gets up and cries and runs in the kitchen.  And he's standing in the corner with his head in the corner when Dennis Quaid gets in there. 
[12:00]
 And at this point, I got tears coming down my face.  I'm laughing so hard.  And Lisa is just beating the crap out of me.  She's crying.  They get very sensitive girls about movies like that.  It's a cult favorite on the Opiate Anthony show.  I love Bill.  It's the best movie and the most heartwarming touching scene.  When Dennis Quaid gets a job far away, he's been caring for Bill.  And Bill got this job at the college making coffee.  They taught him.  Now you put the coffee filter in the machine.  Coffee filter. 
[12:30]
 I got that.  And now five scoops, Bill.  Five, one, two, eight, three, 17, eight, nine.  And then Dennis Quaid was going away.  And he said, Bill, would you like to come with us?  I got a new job and we have a new baby and I have responsibilities.  But you could come if you want.  And Bill goes, I have responsibilities, too.  I make the coffee. 
[13:00]
 I say, oh, yeah, boy, can't find another gem job like that.  Can you, Bill?  I like when he's trying to get the phone number from the operator.  When Dennis Quaid, a character Barry Moore, went to another state to look for this new job.  And Bill's trying to call him because he was all upset.  And he's telling the operator, I want Barry Moore.  And she goes, number, please.  And he kept getting given too many numbers.  Three, five, seven, two, five, nine, six, oh, three, eight, nine, nine, four. 
[13:30]
 I'm sorry.  It's too many numbers.  Barry Moore, five, two, five, six, eight, nine, thirty, eight, seventy, two, five, five.  And then he's driving down the street with Dennis Quaid.  And he kept saying, my sister lived here.  She lived on Florida Street.  And he goes, there she is. 
[14:00]
 Barry lets him out of the car and Bill's chasing this old lady down the street.  It's a scream.  He's going, come here, Mary.  Was it her sister?  No, she turns around and goes, my name is Inga.  She's running hard to fight from this retarded old man with bad teeth and a bad wig.  It's a comedy.  I got regular good hair and good teeth.  I got good teeth because I'm a regular good man.  I got my lucky $5 bill in my wallet.  Oh, Bill, did he sing a song too? 
[14:30]
 Yeah.  I'm going to have to get that.  It's a classic comedy movie.  Watch it with your girlfriend.  She will be pissed to no end at you.  Bill, no from experience.  Starring Mickey Rooney.  1981 ish 82 maybe sequel sock.  Don't bother.  Helen Hunt is in it.  Yeah, in the sequel.  Not not to be bothered.  Bill, Bill.  And that's where Anthony got one of his characters.  Guys, we're all built on a little rascal.  They call my name's Bill.  They call my name's Bill.  The Alzheimer guy that was trying to cross the street.  That's where Anthony got my ripped off inspiration for that pet. 
[15:00]
 Absolutely.  Oh, man.  They keep showing the Doritos chick on TV.  Oh, God, I can't even  concentrate.  Oh, there she goes.  The Rock of New York, one or two seven, WNEW.  Lenny Kravitz and Iggy Pop did a great version of that song during the VH1 fashion awards  a few months back.  Another dumb award show. 
[15:30]
 But it was cool to see Iggy and Lenny on the stage doing that.  They should release that.  It was neat.  Some guy tell Iggy, though, to put his shirt on.  Yeah, that's pretty disgusting view.  You see him on TV and he does those commercials and stuff.  And it's like, wow, I didn't know you had veins like that.  I got his shirt off entirely too much.  He's got just these weird veins.  Popping out all in his neck and everything.  Yeah, guys keep on rocking.  You're doing a great job.  I used to listen to you guys in Massachusetts.  I'm glad you're in New York. 
[16:00]
 Joe, open it.  Thank you.  I guess one of our competitors is 
[16:30]
 leaving and going on to ABC radio.  ABC.  One down, a few more to go.  Godspeed, Rockets.  Godspeed to you.  Have fun over there.  Okay.  That fact's fully distracted me.  Pucker up.  212-757-1027 if you got something for the show.  Hi, NAW.  Hey, I was wondering, can you guys play that,  they call me Bill Bint, they were just talking about on the air,  the Alzheimer's call. 
[17:00]
 Yeah, we can do that.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  We're kind of on that subject.  What the hell?  Yeah, thanks a lot.  We should do that.  Why not?  Okay.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York.  The band is Creed.  Their debut CD, My Own Prison, another track that is one.  I think this is the fifth or sixth song that has made it to radio.  This album is absolutely awesome if you're looking for something new to check out.  Sophie and Anthony, music sounds great today.  Andrea, down the hall about one, two, three, four, five offices.  Thank you, Andrea. 
[17:30]
 We're finally getting there.  I think so.  I think the music sounds great.  Kind of the old, best of the new.  We're getting a little feel here.  Figuring it all out.  Okay, market went down a little bit today,  OPF, to that huge gain yesterday.  Down 77.21 on the Dow.  NASDAQ up 5.23.  So that means Amazon must not have made that much, right?  Let's see what it went up.  Let's see.  Okay, Amazon. 
[18:00]
 Oh, it only went up 20 and seven eighths today.  No kidding.  Are you still in on that one?  I got out yesterday.  You got out yesterday.  I got out yesterday when it was at 138.  But you got in at 126?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I made like a five.  I had two shares.  We figured it out.  You made $65.  Stock goes up 12 points.  You make 65 bucks.  My commission was $75.  You're $10 in the hole.  No, I figure I won, right? 
[18:30]
 Didn't I win?  Barely.  I kind of figured this market thing out.  What did eBay do today?  eBay was up 59 points yesterday alone.  The airline shopping thing is huge now, as we all know.  Oh, my goodness.  And earlier on, it was up another 30 today.  Was it?  Yeah.  Earlier?  When I checked this morning, it was up, I think, 28 points.  Wow.  I'm serious.  I'm just stalling if you notice by my wow thing.  Like you care.  Wow.  Let me see.  Type it in eBay. 
[19:00]
 Let me pop it in there out before you.  Working.  Okay.  That's like, oh, only 15.  Only up 15.  Up 15 today and up 59 yesterday.  Yeah, 298.  Not much of a profit the last two days.  Now, 74 points in two days.  You have to be a mad man to get in on these things.  You have your bottle of Pepto Bismol, your Tums,  and you get into the internet stocks.  Anthony, I'm getting scared, though.  They fly 20 points, 30 points either way on any given day 
[19:30]
 for no apparent reason whatsoever.  I'm scared, though.  Why?  We commute, as everyone knows by now.  We used to talk about radio and what's going on in the news  and sports a little bit and music.  Now, all Anthony will talk about on the way in is stocks.  Anthony now gets up early.  You guys got to understand something about Anthony.  I've known him for five years now.  The guy doesn't like getting up before noon.  If he can help it.  What time do you get up now, Anthony?  Well, I get up probably 830. 
[20:00]
 Trust me, that is very early for Anthony.  Why do you get up at 830, Anthony?  Well, I have to see how the futures market is  and how all the international markets did  over the course of the night.  I get a kind of a read on what's going to happen on Wall Street.  Then you turn on the TV, get a little analysis in you, right?  Turn on MSNBC.  I watch Squawk Box with the boys.  I said, and I pop my computer on. 
[20:30]
 I get on E-Trade and I go to town, baby.  Anthony's tens of dollars are flying out at a time.  He does all this to make about $10 or $20 a day.  It's a little day trading.  I'm a player, baby.  I don't know you anymore.  Come on.  Let me explain.  When I met Anthony, I don't think I've changed that much in five years.  Oh, no, not at all.  All right.  You can abuse me, but let me start.  I was doing a little radio show on Long Island.  And Ant came aboard because he's obviously very talented. 
[21:00]
 And I couldn't believe no one else in radio snagged him up.  Thank you.  Howard was using Anthony a little bit on his show, matter of fact.  Yeah, that was fun.  Matter of fact, he plays all your bits all the time over there.  I get a lot of email about that.  But when Anthony started doing the show with me way back when,  first of all, he couldn't do a radio show without being drunk.  Well, drunk is a kind of a coarse term, Opie.  I used to drink a couple of beers before I came in. 
[21:30]
 I wasn't on any radio station payroll.  I was coming in as a friend.  Well, but don't be defensive.  After working at Apollo Air Conditioning for eight hours a day.  Don't be defensive.  If they're listening, it's five and they know it.  Don't be defensive.  You have changed your ways.  Yes, I have.  It is very obvious.  In your day five years ago, you liked to tip them back a few before you did the show with me.  Well, of course.  I think anybody would be a little nervous going on the great Opie nighttime attitude show. 
[22:00]
 Shut up.  I mean, my God, a boo boo boo.  It was a...  All right.  I had to maybe...  Yeah, I loosened up, let's say.  A couple of beers.  You're right.  Granted, us together is much better than my little solo show, but it was effective.  Okay.  So...  He's like defending himself.  So you were... you liked to tip them back.  Yeah.  And you were into air conditioning.  But you didn't even own a car.  You drove around the Apollo Air Conditioning van.  I never drove the company van at night without their permission.  I did with numbers on the back. 
[22:30]
 It said, you know, if you're driving lousy, call this number.  You covered that up in mud.  I used to...  And why did you have...  Electrical tape changed the three to an eight.  Okay.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Because... all right.  Because you had a jet ski and what you have...  Oh, no!  What you have on the back of the Apollo van...  It was just a coincidence there was a trailer hitch on the back of the Apollo van.  The van that...  I swear to God.  The van that you were not supposed to be driving around after work. 
[23:00]
 And if I'm not supposed to be driving it after work, would I be towing a jet ski  with the comfort with the Apollo van?  Would I be towing it?  Would I be actually driving the Apollo van down the Asherolkin ramp  to put my jet ski in the water during company hours?  Of course you wouldn't do such a thing.  Of course not.  Now let's fast forward five years.  Now you're sipping espresso over there.  You got a laptop in front of you. 
[23:30]
 You now like day trade while we're trying to do a radio show.  I'm not day trading during my show.  You get up at 8.30 now to check out what the future's did.  You have completely changed.  Have I changed?  Have I changed?  A little bit.  I've got to get back to my roots.  I'll never forget when it was time for Anthony and I to leave Long Island  because nothing was happening at that station.  They actually were trying to break us up.  Wanted me to do the morning show. 
[24:00]
 That was a smart move trying to break us up.  There was a real hard decision for me to make.  Should I go with Opie to Boston and start my radio career  on the Opie and Anthony show in Boston?  Or throw out a couple of lame-o jokes with Bucky Buckman  on the morning show?  I actually did his show a couple of times in the morning.  And here is a prime example of how it worked when I was there. 
[24:30]
 I would do like maybe a Clinton thing.  Hey Anthony, do a little Clinton joke.  I sure am in trouble now.  That's hysterical.  72 degrees this morning.  Q of the D coming up next.  That was a great break.  So I could have stayed in that hell. 
[25:00]
 But no, I decide I'd go with Opie.  Thank you, friend.  Well, thank you, Opie.  Mutual admiration.  Full crap is over.  The funniest part about that,  now I go Anthony, you've got a car to drive to Boston.  Because I would only see this Apollo air conditioning bin  that he drove everywhere.  To bar gigs, we'd be slamming shots.  And smoking dope with whoever would give it to us at the time.  I never smoked pot.  No, we didn't actually. 
[25:30]
 I might have had a shot or two.  So Anthony goes, yeah, I got a car.  So I go to his house.  This is like days before we're supposed to leave  for this big radio gig in Boston.  I go to his apartment and the car he was supposed to drive  to Boston was on four cinder blocks in the yard.  I had tires on order.  Well, you're driving that to Boston?  It'll run.  It'll run.  When was the last time you used it?  I don't know, 18 months ago. 
[26:00]
 Well, it might have gotten run down because I never went out  because I couldn't drive the van.  But amazingly, that was the Dodge Aries K, right?  Amazingly, that damn thing lasted for another year and a half.  He drove it back and forth to Boston.  Yes, it did.  About 100 times.  100 times.  It blew up in Mamaroneck coming back one day on 95.  And what did you do?  Left it there.  I ditched it.  Totally ditched it.  So now that you're a world famous radio DJ in New York, 
[26:30]
 maybe someone could get a piece of your car if they're in the area.  That's gone.  What are you kidding?  I'm sure it's still up in that neck of the woods.  Ditch did.  I think I went to a U-Haul place and rented a U-Haul van for like 19 bucks  to get back, dropped it off back in Boston.  So there's a little laugh.  I have changed.  You're right, Opie.  There's a little history lesson for you.  I'm going to have to get back to my roots, I guess.  Yes, because he sips his espresso.  It's not espresso.  It's hot chocolate, you smart ass. 
[27:00]
 Please.  All right.  Well, we're going to talk about the Dow, but I guess not.  We kind of started on that.  But yeah, I took a little detour.  It's pretty even today considering how much it made yesterday.  Okay, cool.  Got something for this mess.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  And some of the facts are sprinkling through.  If you want to add one to the pile.  The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW.  That song sounds great while you're trying to get home.  Yeah.  You want to be going 70-75 when you hear that song, 
[27:30]
 but you're stuck doing, oh, what, maybe 35 right now if you're lucky?  If you're lucky.  If you're lucky.  The latest from the Black Crows before that from By Your Side.  Kicking my heart around.  You okay there?  Thanks a lot.  Just drift over my headphone cord and drift it around my head.  It was like all of a sudden, I'm blind.  I'm blind.  Your headphone went snapping back and hits in the eye.  All right.  This is a real dangerous studio today. 
[28:00]
 Yeah.  We got a big paper cut filming through the Sports Illustrated calendar.  I know you're sitting there going, oh, paper cut.  It was pretty sick.  Everyone got the heebie-jeebies when it happened.  Well, no one likes getting those.  Anyway, Black Crows sounded great on the radio last night.  Yes.  The new CD is coming out Tuesday, I believe.  And Chris Robinson and a bunch of the guys coming in to talk to Ralph DeTora.  Monday afternoon at two o'clock it looks like.  All right.  Cool.  So what's the latest on Clinton?  Have you heard about this new scandal? 
[28:30]
 What?  The prostitute and the 13-year-old child, the DNA.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, supposedly he's got a love child.  A love child.  With a prostitute.  An Arkansas prostitute.  This guy was just going to town.  You know, I can't take credit for it.  Jay Leno had the best joke last night.  He was talking about the prostitute and the 13-year-old.  And he goes, man, we've all seen what Clinton's girlfriends look like.  Can you imagine what his hookers look like? 
[29:00]
 Two-shaded Jay.  Jay is in some trouble.  But the press is trying to talk about this and ask Clinton questions about it.  And the press secretary is going, oh, I'm not even going to acknowledge this.  Yeah.  Oh, stop.  This is complete stupidity.  Don't even.  Oh, that's preposterous.  Oh, getting head in the Oval Office is just fine.  For the American public.  But the possibility that he may have banged a hooker in Arkansas is crazy. 
[29:30]
 Yeah, they can't write anything off at this point.  If a dog comes forward and says that Clinton did it, you gotta take the dog's word for it.  You pretty much gotta believe the dog.  Give them the benefit of the doubt.  Yeah.  But they don't know how they're going to do this DNA thing.  They're trying to read the Star Report to read about the DNA in there.  And then they're going to compare the results.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  To the DNA of this kid.  Oh, they could do that, right?  It's public record, his DNA.  You think? 
[30:00]
 Well, yeah, it would have to be.  You think that's enough?  Probably.  From the splooge stain on the dress.  Yeah, they got that DNA and it's in the Star Report, so I'm sure it's public record.  But I don't think they're going to get an actual piece of the dress.  They're just going to go with what the report says about the DNA.  Well, that's all they need is the little thing that you get once you,  you know, all the little lines, like the little barcode you get when you do a DNA thing.  Okay.  Then they could compare it with the girl and see if Clintons is her dad. 
[30:30]
 The little girl?  No, it's a guy.  It's a guy, a 13 year old boy.  13 year old child.  Boy, yeah.  And supposedly, there's some pictures circulating.  It looks just like, oh, supposedly, I got to see that.  I don't know.  If someone knows where those pictures are, I think it made one of the tabloids, didn't it?  But if you know where we can find the pictures on the Internet,  please give us a call or send us an instant feedback.  We've got to check it out for ourselves.  This is like his little legacy because what wasn't his father a womanizer?  His father was a drunk and a womanizer. 
[31:00]
 Yeah.  And he was dropping batches all over the place.  Some kids here and there.  The mother's like going out with all kinds of guys.  I guess it kind of screwed him up.  There you go.  You know, the president has convicted Phil and brother doing talk show circuit in his defense.  Oh yeah.  That joke.  What is Roger?  Is defending him on the talk show circuit?  Yeah. He's on the talk shows saying how he's a good guy and everything.  Yeah.  Mr. Convicted Cokehead. 
[31:30]
 Now, what happened with the impeachment hearing today?  I don't know.  I haven't been able to confirm this report.  But didn't you hear on TV before you came in?  I heard on MSNBC.  Yeah.  But I haven't been able to see anything else.  That's some one of the senators, a woman senator fainted on the floor or something.  Paramedics had to come to her aid.  Just as they were starting the proceedings.  Yeah.  And it turns out that it's Clinton's sister-in-law.  This is turning out to be the Jerry Springer show. 
[32:00]
 Is this an impeachment trial or the Jerry Springer show?  Yeah, they're going to start punching each other.  That's what I can't wait for.  So are they saying this is a suspicious fainting?  Yeah.  I'm going to have to look into that story, Opie.  Okay.  I'll report back.  Also, the NBA strike is over.  It's on every cover.  Every single paper had the same headline today.  Yeah, they can't get original either.  We got game.  Every paper had it.  The Post, the News, and Newsday.  Newsday put they got game. 
[32:30]
 Oh, that's more original.  Okay.  But what happened to Patrick Ewing?  Did everyone else see that big black hooded sweatshirt of his?  Yeah.  It wasn't a sweatshirt.  It's a leather jacket.  Look on the Newsday cover.  It's in color.  It's leather and the hood is leather and everything is just leather.  Pulls it up over his head.  He's walking around punched over with that big leather hood pulled around his head.  I don't know.  It kind of looks familiar.  You have a thought in your head.  Well, yeah. 
[33:00]
 What is your thought, Anthony?  You know, I don't know who this is going to upset, offend.  Quite frankly, I don't care because this is just what popped into my head.  With that leather hood around his head,  he looked just like the general gorilla from Planet of the Apes.  Oh my, I can't be a part of that.  I'm sorry.  Look, look, look.  What?  I just can't be a part of that.  Just look.  That's not...  I'm not talking about anything racial.  I'm just saying look at the guy. 
[33:30]
 I would have said maybe the black Yoda or something.  But I can't be a part of that.  You didn't remember that guy?  We must kill the humans.  Sorry, my opinion.  All right.  All right.  Very nice, Anthony.  Whoa.  So we got a 52 game season starting February 2nd.  Half the season being played in front of half the fans  because pretty much no one is going to care for a while.  Oh, they will.  They'll go.  Eventually, right?  No, no.  I think right away. 
[34:00]
 You think right away they're going to start selling out these games and stuff?  Right away.  Oh, guys, people, I beg you.  Let's make some sort of stand before we fall apart.  I think right away we'll be packed down.  The one person that is forgotten in all these negotiations is the fans.  Oh, they're not important.  Not at all.  They just give the money.  Oh, all right.  Wow, phone's going crazy.  I think they are offended by your little comment.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York, Georgia, Satellites, 
[34:30]
 it's Opie and Anthony on the way.  Anthony, you should be psyched.  We got another copy of the Jet Song today.  Oh, come on.  The same one we had on the show yesterday.  Where'd you find that?  I thought I had filed the last one.  Well, you smashed the one we got yesterday.  And FedEx does another one today.  So I think we're going to have to play the Jet Song again, Anthony.  We gots to.  But the big game coming up Sunday. 
[35:00]
 All right.  So you think you could sit there and enjoy the song this time around?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I love just songs put to YMCA.  Okay.  Now you had a problem with that song yesterday, huh?  It was just bad.  It just was a badly done song.  I hate song parodies where the words don't quite fit in.  He's got to change where the accents on words are just to make them fit.  All right, we'll play it next.  Oh, thank you.  And we might have a surprise for all the Jet fans. 
[35:30]
 All right.  We're trying to make something happen.  So you might want to stick around for that too, okay?  Right.  Hi, NW.  Hi, NW.  Hello.  Hi, NW.  Oh, great.  That works.  This is why.  Um, how?  Hello?  Okay.  Hello?  That was good.  We were told line four has a great comment about Patrick Ewing.  Nope.  Okay.  Actually, Paul, the lawyer, is on the line. 
[36:00]
 Paul.  Oh, yeah.  Legal counsel.  He pays too much attention to our show.  He's been keeping a list of everything we think sucks around here at NW.  He was saying something like we're bitching all the time about stuff.  And I didn't believe it, but I guess he's got a list.  Well, it's the new year.  It's 1999 now.  We're not bitching as much as we did in 1998, are we, Anthony?  We had much to bitch about in 98.  Yes, but now we're moving forward.  We brought Ralph to tour aboard.  He's great. 
[36:30]
 We've jettisoned some of the older cargo that was weighing our ship down.  New morning show starts a week from today.  So we're moving forward.  Yeah.  So what are we bitching about?  But Paul has a list of things we bitch about.  Hey, Paul, what do you got?  Okay, listen to this.  This is going back a way.  This starts off with Anthony complaining about the computers suck.  Specifically, the website needs help.  On to the next thing.  The phones suck.  Obese earphones suck.  The engineering department sucks. 
[37:00]
 You guys have problems with the other DJs.  The other DJs suck.  The lawyers suck because they get away with fields for meals.  Right.  The N.E.W. van sucks.  Both Beanie and Anthony's commute sucks.  They put no money in your show, which sucks.  And this is my favorite gripe you guys have.  Back when Mellencamp was doing the in-store, N.E.W. has no helicopter,  so we have to walk to the store. 
[37:30]
 I'm worried, guys.  I'm very worried about you guys.  I remember saying that one.  Yeah?  Yeah, that's something a pompous DJ would say.  No, come on.  Because you guys wanted everyone to meet you downstairs.  You're going to walk over there.  And Anthony goes, this is a real radio station.  They have a helicopter to take us over.  I stand by that comment.  I remember because I almost ran into the back of somebody  on the Garden State when you said that.  Well, congratulations, Paul.  You found the underlying theme of the Opiate Anthony show.  It only took you six months, but yeah. 
[38:00]
 We suck.  We feed everything, one or the other.  And our listeners suck.  All right, Paul.  Talk to you, bye.  Good job.  We're taking a lot of abuse in the last few days.  1027W, N.E.W., the Rock of New York.  The song goes on for another 30 seconds, but I never liked this part of the song.  From what you hear, Pink Floyd, welcome to the machine.  Goo Goo Dolls before that from Dizzy Up the Girl and Slide.  It's Opiate Anthony.  Thanks.  And on the phone, I believe we have my favorite jet, number 80, 
[38:30]
 getting ready for the Jaguar game Sunday.  Yeah.  Now, are we positive it's Wayne Corbett?  Yeah, I would think so.  Better be.  Better be.  That's right.  But we've been getting a lot of faxes from Jeff Camp for the last few weeks,  and we found out that a bunch of the guys are really into our show.  They liked Yoshi the Pork Man, the Christmas song that we did.  Well, I'll be hooted.  Just warmed the cockles, didn't it? 
[39:00]
 They were faxing us and calling us and begging us to play that one.  After team meetings and stuff, they would gather around the radio  and get a real laugh out of that.  Yeah.  And we begged Wayne to give us a call and say hi as he gets ready for the big game Sunday.  Yeah.  And he's a little under the weather, so he wants to just hang out for a few minutes.  Okay.  Wayne!  How you doing?  What's up, man?  Oh, man, just trying to take this call.  Yeah, that's what I hear.  You've been under the weather the last few days?  Like three days.  It hit me like Thursday, Thursday. 
[39:30]
 It hit me like Monday night.  It's all been breezy.  Man, you're scaring me.  I might have to change my bed.  No, no, no.  I don't know.  I'll be fine.  Just get a little more rest.  How's the feel of the players right now?  Everybody feels good.  They're a little tight, but it seems like it's totally different to last week.  Everyone's more loose.  I think everyone's scared.  We've been hearing about confidence and not getting too much of it.  Has Bill upped your asses this week or what?  You know, he just gives a look.  He doesn't have to say anything. 
[40:00]
 He just gives that look from the cover of Sports Illustrated.  That's an intense look.  He's got the stare, man.  If you step out of line, the only person that can do s*** on the team is Pepper Johnson.  Really?  Yeah, Pepper gets weird a couple things.  Who's going to mess with Pepper, though?  Well, he's known forever.  Pepper gets weird in a lot of calisthenics and crap like that.  But come Sunday, he's always ready to play.  Not taking antibiotics or anything. 
[40:30]
 It's just getting juiced up and you've got to give as much rest as possible.  And you're still practicing even though you have this cold?  Well, I'm just walking through things right now.  Really?  No one wants to get hurt.  The Rock of New York, 1027W, N.E.W.  Johnny Lang, still raining.  ACDC before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  All right, if you go to the N.E.W. website and go to the Studio Cam link  that we have, that's after they click on our pictures, right?  Right, you click on our pictures and you'll see Studio Cam. 
[41:00]
 You click on that and I put up the pictures of Clinton's love child  and the hooker he had sex with, supposedly.  Yeah, everyone else is saying it.  It's very suspicious, though.  Now that the prostitute's kid is in private school in Australia.  That's where all Arkansas prostitutes send their children to school, right?  Private school in Australia?  Yeah.  Yeah, sure.  Rides a kangaroo to school every day.  And she's not giving any interviews anymore?  No, and they shan't be giving any DNA. 
[41:30]
 Really?  No, the president is pretty free with his DNA, but no, they won't give any.  Okay, it'll come out.  It'll come out in the open.  So you're convinced that this is definitely his love child?  It makes perfect sense.  This 13-year-old boy, Clinton's record in the past.  The whole situation where a hooker has a kid and ends up in private school in Australia.  Now let's get him to the next hemisphere.  Can we put him in a different hemisphere?  Can we put him on the Mars probe? 
[42:00]
 Yeah.  Is there a school on Mars?  A little child could go there.  All right, so they're up and running.  Yeah, they're up.  Very cool.  You can take a look for yourself and you still got time to give  your comments on the instant feedback.  Tell us what you think.  Tell us for yourself.  I'll have the pictures, right?  Well, Anthony, a lot of people want to hear the Jet song from yesterday.  Now you broke the only copy we had.  Yes.  Well, you're not a Jets fan.  Is that what it is?  No, no, I would really like to see the Jets go all the way, of course. 
[42:30]
 I'm from New York, you know.  I'm not going to be one of those, I'm hopping on the bandwagon Jets fans, you know.  So yeah, good job.  Yeah.  You know, I hope they do very well.  And we got to thank Wayne Corbett for checking in earlier.  Yes, he's fighting a cold, but he's going to be ready for Sunday.  But I have a problem with the song because I think it doesn't do the Jets justice.  It's terrible.  All right.  It's an awful song.  And we got a lot of giant fans calling on how could you guys put the Jets on?  You're the giant stadium, blah, blah, blah.  You know what? 
[43:00]
 We had we covered the games here at any W and we begged the Giants.  We said we'd love to talk to a few of the players.  They blew us off.  Simple as that.  Yeah.  Blew us off the whole year.  Thanks.  We find out that Wayne Corbett and a bunch of the Jets are fans of our show.  They've been faxing us and calling us for the last few weeks.  Of course, we're going to put them on the air.  To tell you the truth, I grew up a fan.  Yeah.  So I bought the ridiculous little plastic helmet and shoulder pads when I was a kid.  Ran around the yard.  Yeah. 
[43:30]
 All right.  So we're going to sit through the Jets song today because they FedExed another copy of this.  I'm not going to sit through this and make like I enjoy it.  When what?  Z100 was playing it this morning like it was a real like, hey, this is great.  The Z100 played it this morning.  I swear to God, because I was flipping around the dial this morning,  checking out all the morning shows, which I like to do from time to time.  Oh, Howard was in commercial.  That's right.  Exactly.  At least we tell it like it is here. 
[44:00]
 So, yeah, when Howard's in commercial, you can catch a good half hour of somebody else's show.  You can take a half hour snooze and then he's finally back.  But yeah, so I didn't know where they played the song on Z100.  I'm like, oh, they're probably going to abuse it like we did.  I was kind of getting ticked off like they stole one of our bits.  Because we smashed the CD and everything yesterday.  They played the entire thing.  Hey, that's a great song.  And they came out hooking it up all excited, thinking it was the best thing ever made.  That's going to be a big hit ever made. 
[44:30]
 Yeah, that's going to be as big as that.  Let's go, let's go back in 86.  Let's go, let's go.  This is the next let's go, let's go.  Who came up with that?  Oh, I don't know.  It was all over the place.  Let's go, let's go.  Shut up.  Well, that was horrible, too.  Well, Anthony, let's enjoy the jet song.  I hate the team songs.  Like some jerk off comes up within all the stages.  Like the Packers.  What did they have?  One they did. 
[45:00]
 Hey, Packer Rainer.  Packer Rainer.  Packer Rainer.  It was horrible.  My favorite of all time was the Bears, though.  Oh, what did they have?  What did they have?  The Super Bowl Shuffle.  The Super Bowl Shuffle with the Refrigerator.  The Fridge.  The Fridge.  And that jerk they had as quarterback, McMahon.  No.  That wasn't him?  No, it wasn't him.  Yeah, it was.  Okay, so let's sit back and enjoy the jet song because if Z100 is playing it  and playing it as a real song that they enjoy, I think we're missing the boat on this. 
[45:30]
 We should take another listen to the jet song today.  They FedEx'd another copy.  Okay, maybe I was being a little too hasty.  Yeah, maybe the listeners would call up and tell us what they think of the song.  Okay?  Okay, great.  Surely if Z100 is on top of it, I think we should be too.  Oh, yeah.  Good.  It's not working.  No, it's not working.  Wait, let me try it again.  All right, here it is.  I'll open the window.  Ah.  Woo! 
[46:00]
 Hey!  Oh, boy!  What I mean! 
[46:30]
 Yeah!  Song is gay  This song is gay 
[47:00]
 Terrible  Awful song it's not entertaining  I'm trying to enjoy this and let's go. Let's go blow this away  I look through the listeners thing. Hi any W  Hey any W. What do you think of this great song?  Come on if C100 is playing I think we should play gotta be good cuz they know what's going on 
[47:30]
 I want to hear you throw your car phone out the window. Hold on  You're there. Yeah. Yeah  Okay  Alright I'm on a court house 
[48:00]
 You see what you're doing to people he liked the song so much Anthony that he threw a cell phone out the window  Yeah  Isn't this awful come on see 100 likes it we gotta like it too  No 
[48:30]
 Like the guy in his pal were driving home from the game  This is how the story goes this guy that wrote this are driving home from the game and the both started singing  to the YMCA  And thought up this song. I don't know when I'm driving home from the game with my pals. We're not listening to the village people  All right, call me silly 
[49:00]
 W  Yeah, right here, hey what's going on is this awful?  Hi any W any W  Yeah, we're on the air live. What's up? I just want to know  Yeah  Liberace and Rock Hudson got together and wrote this. I don't know 
[49:30]

I wrote this song  Have to be gay  Did you get it off enough already all right Anthony, what is horrid now listen what now listen  The Jets are going to the Super Bowl  We're gonna need to play the song at least at least another ten times. So please do me a favor  Yeah, yeah take the CD here. Okay, okay and find a really good place for it. Okay, okay 
[50:00]
 Let me put it in I'm gently and gingerly putting it in its case. Okay good. I don't want to hurt this  YMCA all right  Now I see you got it back in the case now  Where can I put it that it would be safe and and no one will get hurt or hurt it step on it?  Maybe well, we got a we got a pile of all our art  You know comedy CDs are too many world CD  Yeah  And a lot of our bits on you want to put it on the top of the pile 
[50:30]
 No carefully place it on the top of the pile. We need to play that first thing tomorrow this CD  Yeah, right here the one in my hand. Yes. Yeah, the YMCA. Yeah, that's parody and careful  Joe who wrote that song don't send anymore  Enough with the YMCA  I'm rolling over in my chair. Here we go
