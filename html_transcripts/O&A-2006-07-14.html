<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie detailing the disastrous state of his apartment, ravaged by flooding and black mold.  He described collapsing walls, extensive mold damage, his attempts to get help from 311 and other city agencies, and his landlord's impending eviction notice.  Club Soda Kenny helped document the damage.  Listener calls followed, detailing similar mold experiences, sleep paralysis, and unusual dreams.  The hosts discussed an upcoming "pest attack" on a rival Houston radio show and a Forbes article about their listeners, dubbed "The Pests."  The irreverent, chaotic tone was established early, with the hosts using nicknames like "Hurricane Ben" and "Martini Steve" for crew members.

The dream and sleep paralysis discussion continued with callers Andrea (who dreamt of the Roman army and an onion country) and Patrick (discussing hypnagogic reactions).  Announcements followed: Carlos Mencia and Taz were in studio, with Twitchels and Big A slated for the news, and John Daly and Jay Moore scheduled for later appearances. A brief listener call was played.

A lengthy conversation ensued between Opie, Anthony, and Carlos Mencia. Mencia discussed his large home, the challenges of furnishing it, and his minimalist décor preferences, interspersed with crude jokes and offensive language. Opie's mold situation was contrasted with Mencia's opulent home, further highlighting Opie's personal struggles.  Photos documenting the apartment's damage were mentioned as being available online.  The hosts introduced Elo, a new PalTalk member and XM employee, speculating about her off-hours behavior.  A call with Frank (Jimmy Norton in character) followed, with Frank sharing a dream involving sleep paralysis, and the hosts engaging in further offensive jokes, this time about Mencia's Honduran ethnicity.

A substantial portion of the show covered a Fox News report from Gaza.  The hosts played audio of a reporter whose live broadcast was interrupted when he inadvertently revealed the location of Israeli tanks, leading to Israeli gunfire. The hosts reacted with jokes and commentary, mocking the situation and the news reporters' clumsy attempts to navigate the crisis.  The segment was filled with offensive language and jokes.

The show transitioned to a segment featuring Lewis Twitchels, whose Tourette's Syndrome became a source of humor.  The hosts teased Twitchels about his weight, leading to a discussion of his condition and dating life.  His involuntary tics, especially his reaction to the word "jump," were highlighted.  Big A and Twitchels attempted a news segment, hampered by Twitchels' pronunciation difficulties, creating comedic moments.  The news covered the Middle Eastern conflict, Pete Coors' DUI, and MySpace's popularity.  Carlos Mencia, Taz (mentioning upcoming appearances on NBC and ECW), and Richard Huff (discussing news reporting) were guests during this segment.  A "walk-over" segment with crude jokes and observations of pedestrians outside the studio was also included.

A phone interview with John Daly followed.  Daly discussed his new book, "My Life In and Out of the Rough," detailing his gambling problems (including an $800,000 loss), relationships, and golfing career, including his long drives and Phil Mickelson's U.S. Open collapse.  The conversation was filled with profanity and sexually explicit jokes.  Later, the hosts discussed a Who press conference where a colleague, Kevin, had an awkward interaction with Pete Townshend; audio of this was played.  The conversation touched upon the band's new album and Townshend's voice, with Taz present in the studio.

The final segment focused on Bill Burr's ranking on Maxim's worst comedians list, pest calls related to this list, the decline of song parodies in radio, and the show's perceived increase in market share compared to Howard Stern.  Multiple pest calls, focusing on the Maxim list and featuring impersonations, were incorporated. Jay Moore, promoting his movie "The Groomsmen," was a guest.  The Lebanon-Israel conflict, an 83-year-old minor league baseball player, an elevator anecdote, and other brief discussions were also included.  The show ended with continued discussion of the Who press conference and the Opie and Anthony tour ticket sales.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  O.P. and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to beat us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting. 
[00:00:30]  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's here like Chuck.  No, that is a...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad. 
[00:01:00]  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the O.P. and Al.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry. 
[00:01:30]  I'm sorry.  I don't know.  Why is the pal saw a camera working?  I don't know.  Really, E-Rock?  What computer does it plug into?  I don't know.  People fixed it last night.  What seems to be the new problem?  I don't know.  Ah.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thank you for that update.  Hi.  Good morning.  It's an animal.  I like to say T-G-I-F, Opie. 
[00:02:00]  That's something I came up with.  Ha, ha.  Every Friday.  Ha, ha.  Ah.  Wunderbar.  Yes.  Indeed.  Good morning and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus.  Ha, ha, ha.  Spreading throughout my lungs.  And spreading across America.  Yeah, the O.N.A. virus in Opie's house. 
[00:02:30]  It's in my house.  It's in my lungs.  It's in my hair.  You're like a coal miner.  You have black lung disease from your apartment.  I'm just hearing horror stories and then I saw horror pictures this morning.  I got phlegm in the back of my throat.  I'm trying to work out so I can do a radio show.  Did you sleep last night at all?  In a hotel.  And where?  In a hotel.  Well, your apartment now uninhabitable. 
[00:03:00]  Is that what we're hearing?  Yes.  Absolutely.  That's fantastic.  I'm a shock jock that's homeless.  Homeless shock jock.  Uninhabitable.  We'll tell you who at 11.  And one of your favorite radio personalities, homeless, we'll tell you at 11.  And a radio personality you love to hate.  Love to hate having his own problems. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, my God.  Relish in his misery at 10.  Yeah.  We're all laughing.  You might as well laugh, too.  We'll have the footage.  I'm homeless.  When last we left Ovi.  Yeah, I guess we're on in some new cities today.  I don't know.  We don't even know anymore.  Well, they reported that we were starting in a couple cities yesterday.  Supposedly, we were on in Providence and New London yesterday.  Uh-huh.  I don't know if we were.  Um, call. 
[00:04:00]  That'd be nice if somebody could call from there and say, hey, yeah, we're hearing you.  But did they hear us yesterday?  Are they hearing us today?  For the first time?  What's the deal?  And I'll be honest with you.  The show is a complete mess.  Today.  I got black lung disease or some kind of something's going on.  Black lung disease.  Jim Norton's not even here yet.  He overslept.  Did he?  I think so.  Did he?  He's en route, though.  Or en route.  En route, depending on how you say roof. 
[00:04:30]  Is that how it works?  Usually roof.  Roof.  Eh, I'm homeless.  Yeah, I know.  Coming in a million times.  People are quoting that.  Yeah, stupid me.  Is your line from yesterday?  Stupid me.  On the walkover, I saw a homeless guy and I openly mocked him and laughed.  You pointed at him and said, ha ha, you're homeless.  And everyone chuckled and chuckled.  And lo and behold, not even 24 hours later, Opie is homeless. 
[00:05:00]  It's going to be a nightmare.  It's going to be, I don't know.  It's going to be a long time, right?  It's going to be a long time, yeah.  I mean, we do the show today and I'm out of here.  I'm going to Long Island.  We're doing that late night karaoke.  Can't wait.  At FH Riley's in Huntington, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  We'll all be there, actually.  My brother's joint.  Can I sing before you, though?  I don't want any mold spores getting on the microphone.  And then I've been wondering why.  I've been saying this on the show for, I don't know, over a week, maybe two weeks now. 
[00:05:30]  I'm the only person sick in the summer.  Yeah.  Yeah, for a few weeks.  I've had like a cold that just will not go away.  Phlegm in the back of my throat.  And this, though, scratchy throat, headaches, you've been having for about a year.  About a year, the headaches, and then more colds than a lot of people get.  Than you're supposed to get.  Than you're supposed to get.  Right. 
[00:06:00]  And my chick's been getting sick.  Oh, boy.  And she's been getting sick.  See?  So now I got her family asking all sorts of questions.  I mean, this is going to be an interesting ride.  But last we left you, yesterday, I'm in a much better mood.  I did actually sleep last night.  I didn't sleep the day before or whatever.  But, God, you want to give the recap?  Well, for a while now, every time it rains really hard here in New York, Opie's basement has been flooding. 
[00:06:30]  And it's not just a basement.  It's part of his apartment.  It's a two-floor apartment.  But it's a first floor and then a basement.  And in order to get away from all the noise at street level, Opie has moved his bedroom downstairs.  And the slum landlord yelled and screamed yesterday saying, you know, that's illegal for me to be sleeping underground.  How is that?  And that's all he cared about.  You lease the apartment.  Doesn't he realize it's illegal?  That was supposed to be a rec room?  Like, he's trying to cover his ass. 
[00:07:00]  Illegal.  When you rent an apartment, you could, unless you're installing, like, a kitchen somewhere where you're not supposed to, you know, because of codes, have a stove, you could put your bed anywhere you like.  It's not illegal.  Get out of here.  So you put your bed down there to get away from road noises and what not.  And then when it rains, the basement leaks.  What it does is it seeps up from the floor, usually.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  When it rains heavy, it seeps up from the floor. 
[00:07:30]  This has been happening.  I've been in that joint about four years.  It's been happening pretty much ever since I got to place.  Right.  And, you know, every once in a while, it's a hassle.  I lost a rug in a flood, you know, a couple years ago.  So it's been ongoing, an ongoing problem.  I've been telling the landlord this is a problem.  And he's like, ah, it's no big deal.  That's what happens in New York.  That's what they tell you.  Sure.  So the water comes up from the floor, makes a few puddles. 
[00:08:00]  You mop up the puddles.  It's a drag.  Turn on a couple fans.  Usually you're good to go.  Dry the place out.  Dry the place out.  Usually, I'll be honest, usually you're good to go.  But in recent months, the problem has escalated.  And walls have been, you know, he goes, oh, don't be dramatic.  They're not collapsing.  That's what happened on 9-11.  He's got it.  He's saying don't be dramatic.  Right.  He's bringing up 9-11.  This is what has been.  Now we completely understand what has been going on. 
[00:08:30]  The walls of the basement have been filling up with water around the entire perimeter.  Yeah.  Okay.  And that water, you know, and more water is trying to get in.  So something has to give.  So the bottom of the walls will give.  They'll push out, all the water is spilling in.  From the floor to about two to three feet up.  I'm not going to exaggerate.  That's exactly what it is.  The sheetrock gets soaked.  But the bottom three feet of the wall push out because the water can't, you know, be held 
[00:09:00]  back anymore.  And that's what happened about a month ago.  Just a complete mess.  Lost thousands of dollars of stuff.  With sludge and mud and leaves and dirt and who knows what else.  Yeah.  Okay.  Who wants to think about what else.  So I told him again.  And he keeps just saying that.  It's like it's no big deal.  Oh, by the way, you know, he wants to evict me from this joint.  No, that's going to be my storage facility for a while.  You evict me?  It's going to be my storage facility. 
[00:09:30]  I ain't going anywhere.  Trust me.  I'm not going anywhere.  You have a lawsuit.  Absolutely, I do.  I'm going to a doctor today to see what the hell's going on with me physically.  There you go.  Tell him I've been in a moldy environment for a year at least.  He's all pissed off that a shock jock would call the government on him.  Trust me.  When it comes to shock jocks and slum landlords, I'm looking pretty pretty.  I'm looking much prettier than you. 
[00:10:00]  You're not reporting him to the FCC.  Yeah, he's trying to say that I'm scum because I'm a shock jock.  I'm like, really?  If you want to figure it all out, slum landlords are a lot lower on the scale than shock jocks.  He's a shock landlord.  Is that even a term?  I'm pointing a phrase.  So then he sent one of his guys over, and they replaced the wall that busted through about a month ago.  Like, ah, no big deal.  Didn't check anything.  And I'm like, I'm telling you, this is obviously a major problem. 
[00:10:30]  There's either a broken pipe or some kind of backup is obviously happening.  If the wall busts in, you can't just fix the hole in the wall because obviously it's coming in from other places.  And you would think the slum landlord would at least stop by and see exactly what's going on.  He hasn't stopped by.  No.  But he wants to say that he's a good guy and this and that.  Of course he is.  And the problem is no big deal.  He hasn't even come over to check it out.  So then two days ago, we went over this yesterday.  Another wall, same thing. 
[00:11:00]  There was so much water behind the walls, it had to give.  So a completely different section of the basement, which is my bedroom.  The wall caves in from the bottom about three feet.  Don't be dramatic.  Right, three feet, sending water, sludge, leaves, dirt, and whatever else again.  So I raised holy hell.  I left a message on the landlord's cell phone.  And he didn't like my tone of voice.  And he's calling our agent saying, I want him evicted. 
[00:11:30]  I want him out August 1st.  I'm like, really?  That's great.  But what are you going to do about this?  You know, as long as you pay your rent, which you shouldn't do anyway.  But even if you don't pay your rent, they can't just throw you out like that.  Oh, I know.  There's all kinds of proceedings that take a long time.  Trust me.  It was an all-day thing.  I know my rights.  I know everything now.  Trust me.  Trust me, I know.  That guy is in the wrong.  He didn't appreciate that I was yelling and screaming and losing my crap.  Because this has been something that's been going on for years, you know, with the water rising and now the major problems that have been happening. 
[00:12:00]  Find out where he lives and shove a fire hose into his basement window and turn it on and say, hey, what are you yelling about?  Right.  So he didn't appreciate it.  And even in my voicemail, stupid me, because I am a nicer guy when I'm not on the radio.  I'm like, look, if you – I gave him one last chance.  I'm like, look, if you don't tell me exactly what you're going to do when the cleanup crew is coming and how you're going to take care of this, I'm calling 311, which in New York City is something –  It's 9-1-1 light.  Yeah, something no landlord wants to hear because then it's a big, big problem. 
[00:12:30]  The landlord's on record and all sorts of crap.  So –  Yeah, they keep tabs, all that stuff.  When you call 311, it goes on record and now the guy's got a bad record.  Right.  You don't want that if you're a landlord.  So I went home after the show yesterday with Club Soda Kenny.  We joke about him, but he's just amazing.  He was at my apartment until about 9 at night.  The landlord did send over a cleaning crew, and Club Soda Kenny is right there supervising. 
[00:13:00]  He's talking to my slum landlord.  Supervising.  He's talking to lawyers.  He's talking to the city.  He's talking to the cleaning crew, gathering info, gathering evidence, taking pictures.  Evidence.  Oh, well, wait.  Is it like CSI?  Did he have a –  Well, this cleaning –  Tweezers.  This cleaning crew comes in, and I guess they specialize in cleaning up what?  What do they specialize in?  Just cleaning up basements and floods and stuff?  I guess they – 
[00:13:30]  His name is The Wolf.  Like fire scenes and, you know, blood damage.  Right.  You know, I guess, you know, they're like jack of all trade.  They just clean up messes.  Dead people in trunks.  Right.  Cars.  And if the slum landlord would have showed up a little sooner in the – you know, maybe  once in the last couple of years, he would have realized that there was a real problem  in this basement because these guys, it took them pretty much seconds to go, we got to  cut away at this wall to see what the hell's going on behind here.  So they cut away, and the first sheet rock comes down just covered with black mold. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Black mold.  Not a little.  Not a little.  Covered.  Right.  I saw the pictures.  They recognized right away.  They're like, this ain't good.  You, like, sleep down here?  They go, like, you got to get out of here.  Yeah.  Toxic black mold.  And then they proceeded to cut away the whole perimeter of the basement from three feet,  two to three feet from the bottom.  You know what I mean?  From the – two to three feet to the floor.  Yeah, to the floor.  All the way around.  Now, something tells me that ain't enough. 
[00:14:30]  No.  Because I think the whole – all the sheet rock –  Dude, it is for the slum landlord.  He wants me out.  He's negotiating with Bob, and, you know, he'll just patch it up.  Patch it up some other poor bastard to move in.  And then he'll just rent it to someone else and not tell the person that the basement floods  because no one told me that when I rented the joint that you may get some water rising.  Here's what needs to happen.  They need to gut that basement, and then a mold cleaning crew has to go down there with bleach 
[00:15:00]  and all kinds of stuff and scrub everything down.  Absolutely.  You got to soak up those bits of brains and blood in the back seat and then cover it up with –  And then they got to, like, spray it all down and then put brand new stuff up.  Or else it's just going to remold – moldify.  They were spraying some disinfectant yesterday, but, you know, that's just, like, the Band-Aid approach.  Yeah.  And then the landlord called me a few times, you know, yesterday, nice as pie, you know, like – 
[00:15:30]  And I kill him with kindness also.  Of course you do.  You know, and I'm going, like, thank you for following –  But, like, he's, like, trying to minimize and downplay this whole thing because he's got to cover his butt.  But it's huge.  Oh, yeah.  It's a huge problem.  Yeah, exactly.  You know, and God forbid that, you know, our pal Opie doesn't have lasting health concerns over the –  God forbid.  I'll say.  From your mouth to God's ears.  Thank God he still has his looks.  The black mold doesn't affect that.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  But we did.  We took evidence.  We took pieces of the sheetrock.  Oh.  And we have a piece – like, a jar full of the –  Did you send it to forensics?  And the scum.  Well, if we have to, if this landlord is going to play hardball, we got the evidence to back it up.  We got the photos.  Nice.  We have sworn statements and testimony from the cleanup crew.  Look at you, Kenny.  And then the slum landlord gets on the phone with one of the guys from the cleaning crew, and he's like –  You know, he's leading them.  He's like, it's not that bad, is it?  He's asking, like, leading questions. 
[00:16:30]  And these poor cleanup guys are stuck in the middle because –  They're just dudes from Spanish Harlem.  This is what they do.  They work their asses off every day, you know, cleaning up slop like this.  Oh, yeah.  They work like dogs, like, you know, all afternoon.  That's real work.  So, you know, they don't want to get involved.  You know, they don't want to tell something bad to the landlord because then the landlord won't hire them to do work again.  Yeah, they want to get paid.  You know, and then, you know, they don't want to get stuck with subpoenas and get in the middle of a court battle either.  Because they didn't clean up good enough or do the right job, right? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, what a mess.  The cleanup guys worked hard yesterday, too, because that was a big mess.  Well, they were there for about six hours.  Yeah.  Six straight hours.  Yeah.  Cutting away the sheetrock and mopping up whatever the hell came out of the walls.  I don't know.  Right.  It stinks.  And I'm following up again today with 311.  We had the Department of Environmental Protection yesterday there, and they're coming back.  Oh, boy.  We're having the housing authorities. 
[00:17:30]  And they never find anything good.  Yeah.  Nowhere they go is good enough.  They could find a problem anywhere.  And this is what bothers me.  I've been on this for years with him.  You know, the water continues to rise up every time it rains hard.  He's like, ah, it's New York.  That's what happened.  Sure it is.  Maybe in an apartment that you're paying a lot less for.  And I sent an email recently because we had some rising water, you know, before the blowout the second time of the wall. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  And Lindsay fell on her ass and could have broke her neck.  No joke.  Like, she went downstairs in the dark, you know, stepped onto the basement floor.  Now it's like an ice rink.  And wham!  And goes flying.  She could have easily broke her neck.  So I'm telling Ira this.  I'm telling him this.  And I'm saying, look, you're going to have a major problem someday.  After I'm gone, you know, because I know you're not going to fix this basement ever, someone is going to end up breaking their neck. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Because you walk down into this area, you know, you turn the lights on at the bottom of the stairs like anyone does.  It doesn't matter.  She went flying and, you know, messed up her knee really bad.  And that wasn't even part of this problem.  Just get you out of there so some other sucker can get in there.  Oh, yeah.  That's the new plan.  Well, we had the door of my apartment open and some schmuck that lives upstairs, he's like, hey, these guys are barely home.  Let me, I want to check out this apartment.  He's trying to look into the apartment. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, that was kind of weird yesterday.  They're already scoping it out.  Oh, because it's New York.  Like, he'll rent that place in a second.  Look, man, when you walk through it, hey, it looks like a really nice apartment for the Upper West Side.  Nice.  But what's creeping behind the walls?  Mmm.  So.  This shock jock, a popular shock jock, has black mold in his house.  House.  An all-new house. 
[00:19:30]  Black mold.  Turns into body cancer.  And house must solve this problem with evidence that a big dopey ex-cop is collected.  An all-new house.  So now we got to get some kind of inspector in there to see how bad the black mold is.  I might lose all my crap because I'm hearing all sorts of things.  You can't really get rid of that stuff without, I mean, a vigorous, what do they call that? 
[00:20:00]  Extermination.  I don't know what it is.  I call it the final solution for black mold.  You must eliminate all of it or else it just comes back.  Right.  So we got a lot of pictures that are going up on opianthony.com.  I'm officially homeless.  Yeah.  That's a bitch.  Obviously it'll be a hotel or something, which is such a, just a drag. 
[00:20:30]  I like hotels.  They change your sheets for you.  You get room service.  I'll have a sleepover.  Sleepover with Jimmy.  I'll do sleepovers with my friends.  Yeah.  He has to sleep on these crusty sheets.  I got a big bed, man.  We can put like the no-homo pillows in between us.  Happy to have you.  Me, you, and O.P.  Nothing.  If you're in bed with another guy, there aren't any such thing as no-homo pillows.  That's all right.  Put a pillow in between each one of you.  Yeah, that's the no-homo pillow.  Yeah.  No.  Fully aware of the no-homo pillow.  You lean over, you clap your friend on the shoulder, goodnight, and you... 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Goodnight.  Goodnight.  Fully aware of the no-homo pillow.  Yeah, last time.  You, me, and O.P.  I'll try it again.  That's when that happened.  I remember the second try.  All right.  Well, I mean, the movie comes out today, and...  Oh, the movie, right.  A lot of people say I kind of look like Owen Wilson to begin with at times.  Right.  The movie.  Dupree.  Oh.  Anyway.  And then in the middle of the day, you just hear Ovi going...  Jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  As Jimmy is whispering in his ear. 
[00:21:30]  Dude.  Let's say hi to Mark in Virginia.  Mark.  You asleep.  Hey, Martin.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, I wanted to let you know, my wife and I are good friends with a couple down in Tampa.  They really are...  They're quite rich.  Their husband's a pro ball player.  And they didn't know it, but for like three years, they were living in black mold.  And their house is like one of these multi-million dollar homes.  And the whole house has been condemned in black mold.  The wife has had so many health problems due to that black mold. 
[00:22:00]  I can't even begin to describe it, but it's like autoimmune problems the whole nine yards.  The kids have been sick as anything, and even her husband has gotten very sick.  They've had to condemn the whole house, and they can't live in it, and they're in the process of building another house.  And the whole nine yards, and I mean, I read this email that came from it, and the black mold that she sent out as a result,  and that black mold has really torn up her family.  So you really, really, really got to get a good checkup when you go in there. 
[00:22:30]  And I can give you off the air her name, and you can probably do a quick search on the Internet,  and you can find out all the information that you want, and I can give that to you real quick.  We've gotten 8,000 emails about black mold and what it does.  Yeah, I already Googled black mold, and I stopped after five minutes.  Yeah, it's pretty scary stuff.  Thank you, Mark.  I'll let you know, brother.  All right, no, I appreciate it.  Is this behind your walls?  Huh?  Is this not like it's behind your walls?  It creeps behind your walls.  Yeah, Jimmy's just joining us.  They found black mold behind the walls.  I got your email.  It was kind of freaked out. 
[00:23:00]  Well, we got a sample.  I mean, how bad was it?  Explain it.  No, it's...  The whole sheetrock was just filled with black, fuzzy...  Yeah, it's fungus.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the spores, like, just float in the air, and you breathe it in.  It's a fungus among us.  And then it gets in your lungs.  Isn't that what, if anyone saw the old Jim Norton cribs we had, me and Florentine had in our old apartment?  Yeah.  Was that kind of mold, or was that no?  No, that was called a conglomerated...  No, it was behind the pictures.  It was like a fuzzy stuff. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Someone was putting tinfoil up in his room.  Tinfoil?  Yeah, to, like, cover it, so...  Are you kidding me?  Could you say it?  Let's, uh...  Like, that's gonna help.  Let's say hi to Dan in New Jersey.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Listen, Ope, you're doing the right thing.  Stay the hell out of there.  All right?  Especially if there's a cinder block mold, which is probably already there.  The whole thing has to be gutted, for a start.  Then you gotta check the structural, which is the block or brick.  Yeah.  Because that still has the mold in it.  I think the Dr. Doom solution is the only way to go. 
[00:24:00]  I guarantee the slum landlord will get me out, he'll patch it up, hose it down, and rent  it to somebody else.  Someone else will rent it.  I guarantee that's what's gonna end up happening.  Oh, this is beautiful.  He'll make sure a few sunny days have gone by before he lets people see it, so everything's  dry, and then...  Yeah, because it's a beautiful apartment with outdoor space, a patio in the back.  Oh, fountains of babies, spitting water out, holding arrows.  A lot of pets already included. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, many pets included, little furry creatures.  You could scratch under the chin.  Oh, look, let's pet the wall.  Last night, airy wall.  Last night, I had just a complete nightmare.  I was dreaming that I was sleeping in the apartment.  Oh, boy.  And then I woke up and opened up my bedroom, because I was dreaming I was sleeping in this  other room, and I saw nothing but rats taking over the entire apartment. 
[00:25:00]  Rats and mold.  And it was so freaking real.  Because it has been for the past year.  No, because what I was...  You know, my nightmare, because they took all the sheetrock away around the whole perimeter  of the basement.  I'm thinking, I've told all the stories about the stuff that crawls in the ceilings.  In the ceilings and walls, yeah.  In the walls.  So now they have, you know, they're not trapped in there anymore.  Nope.  And so they got free run of the place.  So this nightmare last night was so real. 
[00:25:30]  I'm like, holy...  I was so freaked out.  That is just a bad situation.  But now, doesn't that kind of say that you're justified in, like, getting out, and now he  can't do anything, right?  Can't you sue him?  I don't know.  You know what?  Of course you can.  I'm going to do whatever I can.  I'll be honest, because I have been sick off and on for, you know, months.  Mm-hmm.  In the summer.  No one gets sick in the summer.  Nope.  You know, and I've been...  After him for a while, he thinks I'm just nuts, like, oh, it's no big deal.  He knows it's a big deal, but he doesn't want to deal with it. 
[00:26:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because he's a cheap F, a slum landlord.  Barely comes around and doesn't, you know, fix half the problems that are going on in that  place.  In the apartment in general.  I would get a nice hotel room.  Oh.  And bill it to him.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there's the update.  The pictures will be on.  Stay, like, the Four Seasons.  We'll be online.  Get a penthouse at the Four Seasons, dude.  It's going to be interesting for the next 30.  And it's not that I'm cheap.  I've been looking for a place for a long time. 
[00:26:30]  I just, you know, I'm getting closer on a couple things.  We'll see what happens.  Be like Ratso Rizzo.  It's a little health problems.  Right.  Pulled up in newspapers.  Wet yourself.  All right.  I think we're on in New London, Connecticut, and Providence today.  I'm not sure.  Ooh.  I hope so.  Hi.  Welcome.  It's right where.  Oh, nice.  Like.  So we're definitely on?  Yes.  Like the sheetrock in Opie's basement, the virus grows.  All right.  Yeah, we're on the score in Providence. 
[00:27:00]  The score.  Sports talk.  And then in New London, we're on the Wolf.  Classic rock.  Nice.  104.7.  Right there out of the Mohegan Sun.  So, man, these guys are jumping into the Opie and Anthony show at a very interesting time.  Nice.  Very interesting time.  All sorts of drama.  Drama.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll continue with the show and get into some things.  Carl's Mencia stopping in today.  We got Twitchels and Big A doing the news today, I guess. 
[00:27:30]  We haven't had them on in a while, so that'll be cool.  And lots and lots of things to do today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  The Opie and Anthony show is on an extensive quest to find the most obnoxious 30 seconds of audio ever recorded.  How annoying?  This annoying. 
[00:28:00]  I'm a faggot.  If you can do better, email your annoying audio to danny at foundrymusic.com.  That annoys me.  That annoys me.  Hear what everybody else is talking about.  ONA, Uncut and Live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[00:28:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Maybe I'll sing this tonight.  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.  Dirty walls and they're in my house.  Yeah, you asses out there with your song parodies on that fine message board that we can't promote yet. 
[00:29:00]  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.  We're going to sing tonight.  Jim, you missed half the fun.  My slum landlord saying that a shock jock has some nerve to call the city after what he did.  I mean, yesterday.  Oh, okay.  I was blaming you.  Yeah, well, it was said again yesterday.  And I'm thinking, hmm, slum landlord shock jock, which is worse? 
[00:29:30]  Which is worse?  Say goofy stuff on the radio.  The radio, apartment gives people lung disease.  Hmm.  Let's say hi to Doug Out Doug.  Doug, you got to make it fast.  We are very busy today.  Good morning.  I want to give you some...  Of course, he's one of the big O&A pests.  You have the new listeners out there.  What's up, Doug?  I want to give you some information that the pest attack is indeed on with the Johnson & Johnson show.  Or in Houston. 
[00:30:00]  Or Walton & Johnson.  Walton & Johnson.  It doesn't matter, but let me tell you, they are expecting us, so we need large numbers.  We need as many pests as we can to join in.  They started their show this morning with a soundbite of our little Jimmy Norton.  So they're taunting us.  They're calling us out.  What's the soundbite?  What soundbite?  Yeah.  Got to be creative.  It's from, I believe, Lucky Louie's show.  Okay.  Where Jimmy demonstrates the sound effects of performing an act on... 
[00:30:30]  Use your imagination.  All right.  Very good.  Okay.  Good.  So they're going to make fun of us by playing a clip from Jim Norton's HBO show.  Good.  Indeed.  Keep playing it, you hillbillies.  Keep playing it, you stupid, phony, one guy doing all the voices.  Hicks.  They're phonies.  One guy does all the voices.  He lies to his listeners.  Yeah.  This is something we've been developing on the XM Satellite radio show, but basically  this show in Houston, you know, kind of talked bad about Bill Burr behind his back after 
[00:31:00]  he left the studio, and then we found out that Jim Norton had a bad vibe when he went  into their studio.  And then it turns out it's like two guys, and one guy does like three voices, and if  you go on the show, you got to make believe that the guy's not doing three different voices.  Yeah, like all of a sudden a girl will start talking, but the guy, it's just the guy doing  a bad girl voice, and you're supposed to sit there and talk to him like the girl just  talked instead of going, dude, why are you doing that? 
[00:31:30]  So you're supposed to interact like, you know, all of a sudden if you heard a woman's  voice right now, I have to go, well, listen, sweetie.  Yeah.  I'm going to go in there and interact with you because you're a fraud with your listeners.  And do some kind of improv garbage.  Ugh.  They're two stupid old men.  So Bill Burr kind of called them out on our show.  Yeah.  And then I guess now they're attacking, or they're, I don't know what they're doing  actually.  So Doug, what do you need the pest to do?  All right.  Since we can't give out any other website, I have kind of figured out that we can give 
[00:32:00]  out a MySpace with information on how to attack.  Do you think that would be allowed?  Yeah, sure.  Okay.  The MySpace.com slash Opie and Anthony Pests.  Opie and Anthony Pests?  Opie and A-N-D.  Opie and Anthony Pests.  All right.  Very good.  All one word.  All the information on how to contact the Johnson & Johnson show.  Yeah.  A lot of people decided to take Friday off just to mess with these guys in Houston today.  So give us an update later on in the show, Doug. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  We've got a pal talk room open.  We're already streaming, recording, and you guys should have some audio by the XM show.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Party on, Wayne.  Congrats to the Pests for making another Forbes article.  Yeah.  What was that about?  That guy.  What the hell's his name?  We rattled him.  We really ripped him because he gave us some crap in one of his first articles that he wrote  about the show and XM in general.  And then I guess the Pests unloaded on him. 
[00:33:00]  So the second article he wrote, he mentioned, hey, and before O&A's Pests just start, you  know, firebombing my Greg Levine.  That's his name.  Before the Pests start, you know, just flaming my email box.  This isn't about O&A or some kind of defensive posture he took.  Yeah.  Before he said what he had to say.  Yeah.  Because he knew the first time the Pests just like nailed him. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  And then yesterday he was, I guess, nominating me for chief marketing officer of XM because  I'm always online and always, you know, chatting and on various electronic medium on the computer  with all our listeners.  And the Pests are always stickering stuff and making pests to themselves and getting the  word out there.  So he was nominating me and the Pests for chief marketing officer.  And it's funny until you realize, oh, my God, this is in Forbes magazine. 
[00:34:00]  This guy's writing for Forbes and addressing the Pests.  Well, the guy really did kind of start with the show for no reason.  I mean, we didn't know who the guy was.  But he's coming around.  Yeah.  He's coming around.  I think he's starting to appreciate what it's all about.  Like, like through the first hatred and bashing of us, he kind of did a little more looking  into what goes on on this show.  And, you know, he's kind of warming up to it.  Well, instead of, you know, being lazy, he's doing his own research because a lot of these  reporters out there, they're just lazy.  Oh, they're Howard Stern ripoffs.  And then we challenge these people on that. 
[00:34:30]  Like, oh, really?  Do you know we do this, this, this, this, this, which is completely different than any other  radio show out there.  And then you kind of turn them if they're willing to listen and do some research.  Yeah, give a little listen.  Like yesterday, we did an interview with the Boston Globe.  And this guy's in a pretty big position.  He's running for the Boston Globe.  And it seemed like he didn't even know much about us.  I know.  He's doing like the Sunday Magazine or something.  And I'm like, how does a reporter get away with that?  He said, yeah, I used to listen to you guys. 
[00:35:00]  I was like, oh, yeah.  And I figured in Boston, no.  No, at N.E.W.  N.E.W. in New York.  And you guys were really, really good.  And then I got really busy with my career, so I haven't heard you in a while.  I'm like, oh, great.  Great.  I'm sure this article will be very, very accurate and up-to-date.  Because in order to get like an up-to-date kind of accurate interview of us,  you've got to know what's been going on in the last at least two, three months.  Right.  That's when a lot of stuff's been happening to this show.  Syndication, back to broadcast radio. 
[00:35:30]  And no, not really much of a clue.  Call you Anthony, and then it quotes Greg Cumia.  All right, I wish you could.  The Malti and Anthony show.  I had last night, I had nightmares last night, man.  I was, I went to bed.  Poor little lamb.  I've been working on updating my stupid site finally, and it's not good.  You had nightmares in your fresh-aired apartment?  Oh, dude, I kept dreaming that little, the daisies were all over, and it was just lovely, 
[00:36:00]  and little springs in the air.  Smoked all nice and fresh.  No, but I kept waking up, because I was dreaming that, like, I kept dreaming that my, I felt  something tickling the top of my head, and I dreamed it was a mean elf, I swear to God.  Is he taking his big hand and pushing your head down?  No, no, no, no, no.  I said elf, not Ralph.  It was a guy, I almost said I said elf, not elf.  I just dreamed that there was an evil elf tickling me with his toothache.  It was really creepy. 
[00:36:30]  That is a creepy, stupid dream to have.  Awful, awful.  I kept, you ever, like, try to sleep, and you keep feeling, like, energy?  Yeah.  Yeah, I hate that.  What the hell is that?  Right on the brink of sleep, you're almost asleep.  Yeah.  But then you, like, can't move.  You have, like, you have night paralysis, like sleep paralysis.  We've talked about this on the show before.  I get that a lot.  I can move.  I don't get night paralysis, but I get jarred awake by, like, a sound.  Not really a sound, it's like a feeling, a buzzing, something in your whole body just 
[00:37:00]  goes, and you're up.  That's your soul trying to leave your body.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah, I think so.  But you're not brave enough to let it go.  Was I dying?  Are you insane?  I was dying.  I remember once as a kid, I swear, I swear to you, unless someone, I mean, there's got  to be an explanation, but I-  You were dreaming.  You're a dopey little kid.  I was dreaming, but it felt very real that I actually left my body and started wandering 
[00:37:30]  around the house a bit.  Unsolved mysteries.  Swear to God.  Someone explain that to me.  Because it didn't, it was like I was dreaming, but I'm like, no, I'm not dreaming.  I'm actually moving around my house right now.  No alien probing going on.  I was just a kid.  I was like, I don't know, 12 or 13 years old, somewhere around there, 14 maybe.  A light lift you up to a craft probe?  No, but I had that weird feeling like I was leaving my body, that energy, and then next  thing you know, I'm kind of in the bathroom.  Big head, big eyes now.  That's an intensified- 
[00:38:00]  I hate that.  And my eyes half open, and you can't move.  I can't move.  I'm like, oh my, it's terrifying.  When that happens, do you feel like it's a ghost pinning you down?  Why has it always got to be paranormal with you?  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  No, I feel like-  No, I'm just saying, because now that happens to me as well.  And then Bigfoot came in and choked me.  No, this one incident happened when I was a lot younger, and it's always been in the  back of my head my entire life.  Like, what was that?  Was it just a dream, and I'm just stupid? 
[00:38:30]  Or was there something else going on?  I don't know.  Did you have a fever?  I don't remember, to be honest with you.  Honestly, I don't want to sound like a kook.  I mean, I sound like a kook all the time.  No, because when you're a kid, things like that happen.  It could have been just a dream.  Seriously, it could have been just a dream.  But I felt like I was actually walking around my house, and my body was still in the bed.  But I definitely get what Jimmy gets to this day.  And sometimes I feel like it's some kind of, like, ghost or something holding me down the  bed.  And it's the most terrifying feeling you could have. 
[00:39:00]  You've got to kind of wake yourself up and move around a little bit, and then go back  to sleep.  Because if you just shut your eyes and try to go back, the second you reach that point  again, like, what is that stopping?  I actually pray when I woke up, like, please, God, please, God, please.  I was so happy.  I have a sleep and scared.  My eyes were open.  I couldn't move.  I thought there were demons coming.  You needed a Russian president to kiss your belly.  I certainly did.  I could rub his head.  Tee hee hee.  When you had your eyes open?  They're always half open.  Like, I'll open them, and I can't move. 
[00:39:30]  You're a creep.  See, I'm too scared to open my eyes when that happens.  What?  I have to.  I swear to God, because I feel like something is holding me down in the bed.  I have to wake up.  We've got some explanations.  We've got Nolan in Texas.  Nolan, what's up?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hi.  The first thing you're talking about, like, the waking dream where you feel like you're,  you know, consciously dreaming.  Yeah.  It's like they refer to that as something like astral projection, like out-of-body experiences,  that kind of crap.  Right. 
[00:40:00]  Astral projection is like something where you're supposed to be able to lay down.  and project your inner essence, whether you want to call it a soul or whatever, to different  locations, anywhere in time and space and stuff.  And that's just bunk.  If I could use, excuse my language, you might jump out of this.  Yeah.  That's malarkey.  Oh, Al.  Al, get up in there.  Oh, boy.  We don't need fines.  Someone else is.  The second thing y'all are talking about is sleep paralysis.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what people get. 
[00:40:30]  I remember people in my family, like my mother would get that.  She'd be asleep on the couch and then you'd look over and just see her eyes open with  this horrified look on her face and like years ago.  I think that comes from stress, anxiety, things like that.  When you're really tired.  Yeah.  When I'm really tired, it happens to me.  Someone else is saying it's lucid dreaming.  That's coming in a lot.  Lucid dreaming is something else.  What is lucid dreaming?  That's where you're able to control your dreams through some kind of exercise that 
[00:41:00]  you do.  You go through like weeks or months of this exercise, sometimes accompanied by music or  some subliminal sounds.  And with enough practice, you're supposed to be able to go to sleep and then actually  have control of your dreams and be able to do whatever you want in your dream.  Sometimes that happens normally.  Like you ever been in a dream and go, oh, my God, I'm dreaming.  Dreaming.  This rules.  Now I can do whatever I want.  I usually either I do one of two things.  I'll fly because that's always fun or I'll grab any girl and rip her clothes off. 
[00:41:30]  Because, you know, you got a free pass here as far as legality.  I am so with you.  I've had that happen, too.  But it's a balancing act.  Oh, because you can't concentrate too much.  No.  Because all of a sudden you're in a safari in Africa.  You're like, oh, man.  I had it.  What happened?  And you're aware.  You're like, okay, don't think too much.  Get back into it.  Just kind of go with it.  And then the worst thing.  Don't think too much about what's going on. 
[00:42:00]  The worst is like, uh-oh, I'm waking up.  I'm waking up.  And then you feel your eyes kind of open.  You're like, no.  I was right there.  Dammit.  I was at the sorority house.  They're coming home.  It's four in the morning.  They're all drunk.  I get that feeling whenever I'm around my friends, Opie and Anthony, I pinch myself.  I must be dreaming.  I must be dreaming.  I must be dreaming.  Aw.  Little angel, Jimmy.  Oh, you know, I just sweet talk everyone.  Let's say hi to Tom doesn't like your name, The J. 
[00:42:30]  So we'll just call you The J from New Jersey.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Jimmy?  How do?  How do you do?  The thing that you were talking about, I think it's called lucid dreaming.  It happens to me a lot when you, you know, wake up in the morning and then go back to bed.  You kind of feel like you're dreaming.  It's so surreal.  I just described lucid dreaming, and you completely didn't listen.  All right.  Thanks, bro. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, Anthony already explained all that.  Let's go to Pat in Brooklyn.  Pat.  I have a microphone in front of me.  I am a professional, and I know everything.  Pat.  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  What's up?  I actually had a similar experience when I was younger.  It felt like I was actually, like I left my body and I was floating down the stairs.  Yeah.  I can never explain it because I knew for a fact my feet weren't touching the ground.  I just thought it was like some crazy dream.  I know it felt so damn real.  Yeah.  I can never explain it.  I had that happen once to me, and it's in the back of my mind all the time. 
[00:43:30]  I remember being a kid.  So being a kid, a couple of times something happened where you had these dreams that were  just really weird, and I think it's just your brain growing or your body growing, a synapse  kind of blossoming in your head, finally firing for the first time.  You know, you're growing.  Things are being added to you.  And when you have a dream, when you're a kid, some of these things can be so real that – because  I have a few that I remember in my head.  How do you remember a goddamn dream from, you know, 30 years ago? 
[00:44:00]  How else are you going to explain it?  But, you know, it was a dream.  But it's so realistic that it stands out in your mind as a real memory.  Right on.  I hope, unless I was –  If you want to rock and roll in your sleep, just have a huge meal and then go to bed.  Does that do it?  Oh, man.  When you eat, like, bad stuff – because I've heard that, but I never really –  I'm at the point now I'm eating dinner at, like, 5, 6 in the afternoon so I can get a really good night's sleep. 
[00:44:30]  You can go to sleep at 7, though.  Well, I know.  Without, like – because, yeah, when you eat a big meal before you sleep, all sorts of crap starts happening.  Paulie and New Rochelle.  What's up?  Good morning, fellas.  Hey, Paulie.  How you doing?  Listen, it's got to do also with eating before you go to bed, man.  Yeah.  If you eat, I was under doctor's supervision.  I was having bad nightmares to where I was waking up violently.  And actually, when I wake up violently –  Punch a blood in the face.  I would punch my girlfriend right next to me.  There you go.  Somewhere.  Somewhere she would get punched. 
[00:45:00]  She thought I was doing it on purpose.  But it has to do with eating before you go to bed.  If I ate an hour before I went to bed, I'd have some pretty bad nightmares.  So I don't eat before I go to bed.  So, you know, my girl doesn't have bruises on her head.  Dude, I ate last night probably like around 10-something at the cellar.  Went home.  I was, like I said, doing website updates for hours.  Went to bed probably like around 1.30.  Ooh.  Which is fine.  I usually get like three and a half hours.  Yeah.  Four hours a night.  And then I doze off in the afternoon.  It's just my schedule for – 
[00:45:30]  You doze off during the show.  No, I'm wide awake and chipper, chipper, chipper.  But that's the way I do it.  And I'm fine with that.  I kind of like being on three and a half, four hours maximum.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I like that.  I need a little more.  All right.  But that's – I hadn't eaten hours.  It gives you those wacky dreams, though.  See, that's probably why you're having nightmares.  I enjoy a good nightmare sometimes.  There are ones that just petrify you.  Yeah, it's like a movie that you're in.  Ones that I have – do you have recurring nightmares or recurring locations?  Like I have sets. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Like it's a set.  Yes.  That's all set up and it's the same place and the same type of nightmare.  And it usually involves me and a house I used to live in when I was like in my late teens.  And there's people always trying to get in and I have some kind of weapons but the bullets never fit in the gun right or the gun disappears right when you're trying to use it.  Yeah, everyone has those dreams.  My recurring nightmare.  No, I'm –  Oh, really?  Well, that kind of dream.  But you're goofing on me because that's like my real life too. 
[00:46:30]  No, it's a different scenario but I guarantee people are all nodding in their cars.  Like with me, it's being a DJ and I can't find the next song.  That's common for Josh.  The stress and anxiety I feel as I try to find the next song and I find it just in time but it's a crappy song.  Oh, I have radio dreams too but for some reason, and I don't know why, the location is in a cave.  It's the dumbest thing.  It's always – the mics are there and all the high-tech equipment but we're in a cave.  Is there fur around it? 
[00:47:00]  No, there's no fur around it.  No black mold?  No black mold.  You know why?  Because we've worked in a lot of, you know, assholes in our career.  What a crap.  Can I tell you a cute story about me?  You're really going to like this.  A little dreamy thing?  Well, you know, I have trouble sleeping at night, insomnia.  So somebody suggested if I drink warm milk, it'll make me go to sleep.  So I drank the warm milk and I fell asleep and then I had nightmares that I was up all night.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to have a compelling nightmare that that moment lasts for four hours every day 
[00:47:30]  and it's –  Yeah, I hope people –  All our mics are off and that's all we hear.  I hope people this weekend have that dream over and over again in their head.  Do you know, if you cut Kenny's head open and pulled his brain out, I think you'd find black mold behind the skull.  Kenny's head, if you look at Kenny's head, it's the perfect head to be squatting on a leaf  and nibbling it.  Yeah.  Kenny is head like a praying mantis.  You can't kill Kenny because it's a $50 fine.  It's illegal.  Let's go to Jared in Boston. 
[00:48:00]  Government will fine you.  Jared.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got some info on that sleep paralysis.  It's actually an evolutionary holdover.  It's like some people have it, some people don't.  It protects you while you're sleeping from walking up and getting hurt or something.  It's just one of those weird things that people have.  It's getting stepped on by a mastodon.  What the hell are you insane?  I love some of the theories that pop up.  I mean, that's as viable.  I guess that's as viable as any other silly theory.  But when you just speculate, it's an evolutionary holdover. 
[00:48:30]  Some have it, some don't.  Like the appendix.  I don't know.  It's just something that we don't need.  Maybe it's just that, you know, sometimes your body acts weird.  Yeah.  Can't you just explain it like that?  Dr. Kaku would know.  Let's go to JD in Kansas City.  JD.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  You two sweet cheeks.  Hi, fella.  The reason Opie does want to open his eyes when he's doing these dreaming things is because  he's going to find a black guy standing over him with a hoodie on.  Oh, man.  That happened years ago to Opie.  When we're back on in Buffalo, the first day back on in Buffalo, I'll tell that story 
[00:49:00]  again.  Do that.  That is the creepiest thing that ever happened to me.  Thanks, JD.  And that may be happening, I think.  I get the creeps at night if I get woken up after a nightmare or something like that.  And you look around the room because there is always something in the room that looks  like something else right when you wake up.  Yeah, we talked about that.  The second you wake up, like, I open my eyes and it's like, oh, great.  There's like a World War II soldier there.  Oh, good.  There's a monster, the creature from the Black Lagoon, and it looks just like him. 
[00:49:30]  Or just some wacky guy in a suit out on my patio.  Yeah.  That's the scariest thing, when you just see a regular person standing somewhere, and  then you move your head a little bit and realize it's just a reflection.  I'm at the point where I leave the lights on upstairs now because of that.  All right, you've got to get over that.  Get your lights out.  No, it's creepy.  Is it just too scary?  Yeah, I saw an old lady on my couch.  Yeah.  But as soon as I turned the lights on, it was a pillow and a blanket that was set just right. 
[00:50:00]  I have the same crap where I'm just petrified to walk upstairs in the morning.  We're all a bunch of scaredy cats as humans.  We're not scared when it's light out.  What is that?  Yeah.  Most people I know, the tough guys will call in and go, get over it, pussies.  But the reality is when the lights go down and...  And that's just a primal thing.  It's so...  Something happens.  How does that happen?  We figured out a way to flip lights on everywhere and stuff, but there's still this primal instinct  in us that dark, bad, scary monsters. 
[00:50:30]  You can be snuck up on in the dark.  It's harder to do in the light.  I mean, it's a common...  Yeah, but you can also look at it as it's easier to sneak up on at night and it's easier  to evade at night.  Hey, let's...  Usually things that can sneak up on you have like night eyes.  Or they're little elves.  Night eyes.  They're little elves that go...  Who we all know have great night vision.  And they'll just, as you're sleeping, go...  Scratch your head.  Why is the mean elf tickling my head?  Hey, let's go to Andrea in Boston.  She has the same thing as Jimmy. 
[00:51:00]  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Oh, God.  I had to do it.  He had you.  I saw Ant gearing up.  I just saw the shoulders hitch.  Here's slow-mo.  Aids.  Photo finish on the AIDS joke.  That'll be a recurring lovely dream I have.  The every time Ant goes to talk, I just kind of jump in and have it first.  And I do the impersonations just a bit better.  Go ahead, Andrea.  I think it was the real people.  Hey.  I have the same thing as Jimmy.  And I've had it for like my whole life.  AIDS?  Remember.  No.  Late.  Sorry. 
[00:51:30]  Ah, she laughed at mine.  Ah, Jimmy, you suck.  Miss.  Hey, that's one of my original jokes.  Thank you, Andrea.  Go ahead.  You're welcome.  I have a sleep paralysis.  Apparently you still have it, don't you?  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Sleep paralysis?  Yes.  That's him, and it's scary, and you shouldn't make fun of him.  There's nothing wrong with him.  All of a sudden you can't move, right?  Yeah.  Well, I created a party.  She passes out on the couch.  She can't move.  Yeah.  Eyes wide open.  I gave her sleep paralysis with a little powder on the old drink-a-roof. 
[00:52:00]  The old drink-a-roofy paralysis.  The roof-a-tini.  The roof-a-tini.  I had this dream.  There was a chin on my shoulder.  I'm sure you did.  All right, Andrea.  Anything else to add to that?  No, that's it.  Thank you.  I had a dream.  I was in the Roman army and had to wear a helmet.  And I was off to war.  And we were invading a place that was suddenly onions.  The country of onions.  Patrick in Queens.  One more, and then we've got to take a break. 
[00:52:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  That thing that you get with a surge of energy right as you're about to fall asleep is called hypnagogic reactions.  Hypnagogic.  Hypnagogic?  Yeah, that's a science word for it.  Some people get it where they have insomnia because every single time their body goes to release so that they don't act out their dreams and, like, sleepwalk, that they get that energy surge and they jerk and they wake up.  The hell does that come from?  I don't know.  Because I know the jerk thing, the one where you fall asleep and all of a sudden your leg will just go, boink, it'll kick out. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know how many times my girlfriend has just, like, whacked me right in the groin.  She jumps and the knee will come up and, oh, oh, sorry.  And she's back asleep.  Or you wake up and your arm will flail because you had, like, this little semi-dream that something was trying to touch you and you pushed it away.  Anyway, that's different than that energy surge that you get.  All right.  Both of them wake you up. 
[00:53:30]  That energy surge thing is just weird.  I don't get it.  Yeah.  I get the little twitch thing.  You're in the Roman army.  You're invading that country.  The whole country you're invading smells like onions.  And when your eye opens, you look up and you realize there's a solar eclipse.  I've been blinded in battle.  Why is the sun so dark?  Did I die and they put coins over my eyes and sent me across the river?  All right.  Here we go.  We've got to take a break. 
[00:54:00]  We're so late already.  We can continue no problem.  What's this down my nose?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  When we get back, Carlos Mencia joins the program.  We've got Twitchels and Big A.  They're doing the news today.  Also, Taz in studio, our old friend.  And later on this morning, we talk to John Daly and Jay Moore.  A very, very busy day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show right now.  866-313-3. 
[00:54:30]  ONA, who's this?  It's Opie and Anthony.  What do you got for the show?  Nothing.  So, why'd you call?  The Lummy.  If you have a point that's relevant to the topic at hand, call the Opie and Anthony Show  at 866-313-FREE.  Hello.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:55:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're going to move on from dreams and nightmares and all that crap for now.  We'll pick that up at a later date.  If you got something for the show, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  How long is it going to take me to drive to the restaurant tonight from Manhattan?  What time are you leaving? 
[00:55:30]  Everything's starting around 10, right?  Yeah, yeah.  So, I figured I would leave at about 9.50.  10 minutes?  No, if you leave at 8, it should take you no more than an hour.  It should be about 10 minutes.  Perhaps more than that, Anthony.  Looks like we're going to have a good crowd.  Late night karaoke at my brother's restaurant.  Always funny.  My restaurant, FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  We'll see you out there tonight, okay?  Right.  In the studio, Carlos Mencia.  Carlos.  What's up, guys?  Hello, Carlos.  What's happening, man?  Hello, Carlos.  It's huge in here.  Hello, Carlos. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, a lot bigger than the other jernt.  Yeah.  It's huge, man.  Yeah, the XM studio.  We're all cramped in that little room when you come in.  It feels creepy that there's like nothing way over here.  I know.  That's like the, I don't know.  What do we call it over there?  Look how huge that TV is, though, so we can see it.  It's awesome.  Yeah, they take care of us over here.  We're very happy about that.  It's like you walk in and it's that, you know what it looks like?  It looks like the apartment that you moved into when you made money, but you haven't had  enough time to put furniture in it.  Yeah, but it doesn't have as much mold as Opie's. 
[00:56:30]  I wish I could say that it looks as big as your living room there, Carlos.  Did you finally fill that up with furniture?  Yeah, I had to because I did MTV Crib, so I had to act.  Oh, that's right.  We did talk about this.  All right, yeah.  I had to fill it all up.  When I was just wandering around America, one of my trips, I was out in L.A. and Carlos  invited me over to this crazy house and this living room that looked like it was  a tennis court. 
[00:57:00]  It was as big as a tennis court and in one corner had a huge couch and a huge TV and  the rest of it, I swear to God, you could pretty much play dodgeball or something.  It was massive.  Did you get people or did you fill it up yourself?  How'd you do it?  Oh, no.  I had to hire somebody.  You had to hire?  Yeah.  You hired a fruit?  What'd you do?  Yeah.  No, actually, it was a chick.  Yeah, a chick?  Yeah.  See, everyone thought it was a fruit.  I just made an appointment.  I saw a chick the other day, went to a place, and I just immediately, I'm like, because 
[00:57:30]  you got to look through material, like swatches and stuff, and I don't, I can't.  I can't.  I can't.  I hated that part, and my wife was like, we have to make this decision together, and  I was like, why can't you do it?  Like, what part of I don't care?  You'd be happy with everything in the place, right?  Yeah.  See, I, you gotta, you gotta pay attention or you're gonna be living in a floral mess 
[00:58:00]  or something.  Who cares?  You don't care?  Who, really?  I'm not saying that, you know, I need to know everything, but I at least want to kind  of keep my eye on things.  Do you?  I'm thinking that, yeah.  I'm pretty open to this.  What I need, I like a lot of open, I don't want, I hate those houses you walk into, and  there's gotta be furniture on every part of the floor where it's an obstacle course, there's  like the big puffy chair and the couch and tables and this crap.  I like, like, openness.  Yeah.  So, you know, a flat screen on the wall and a couch, I want it to look like a friggin' 
[00:58:30]  Kubrick movie.  Just nothing.  You know?  You don't like those ones where you go, where those homes you go in and there's that furniture  that nobody ever uses in that room that just...  And they don't, you don't use it because you don't know how to sit on it.  Right.  It's like that angular couch, you know what I mean?  It looks like it came out of Beetlejuice.  Yeah, there's modern furniture that's just stupid.  Like you're waiting for the guy with the big head to come out and marry somebody.  Yeah, some dopey artist came together with some furniture guy and decided to make this 
[00:59:00]  piece of art, man.  It's not...  No.  It's like a coffee table.  You can't put anything on because it's at a 45 degree angle.  Right.  You put your change on it and it rolls off.  It's like...  It's not functional at all, but it's quite gorgeous.  Ugh.  Ugh.  No.  You don't like that?  No.  I like...  But that's what the fruit's gonna get you.  No, see?  Because oddly enough, I'm very traditional.  As far as like a dining room goes and stuff, I want the big wood.  I want the wooden table with the big chairs.  Like I remember when I was a kid, I want like traditional stuff. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, you're gonna fight with the guy.  Whoever you get...  I ain't getting no guy then.  They're gonna hate you.  I'll get a woman.  And if she don't like it, I'll punch her in the eye.  No, the women are better.  Women are much better.  Women are like, oh, all right, what do you want?  The guys are like, are you serious?  No, you don't want...  That's why we didn't.  Because even my chick said, she goes, I don't want a guy because guys are gonna do what they  want to do.  Yes.  And they're not gonna listen to you.  A woman will listen to you because you go, no, I don't, I'm not into that.  And the guy goes, no, you don't understand what you're into. 
[01:00:00]  This is all the...  The window treatments now are nothing but driftwood as a curtain.  Yes.  And rags of burlap.  What?  I want curtains.  I had one...  Permission to come aboard.  You should get a nautical...  This is the place to be great.  What's his name?  Chris Lloyd?  Chris Lloyd.  Get Chris Lloyd to do your house.  We're watching that show one day, he goes, we're gonna do a nautical motif in this, so  that's why I'm dressed like a captain.  Permission to come aboard.  Like, yeah, okay, load the torpedo in the torpedo shoot, faggot. 
[01:00:30]  You should just get a guy from MTV to come over and do it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they do a good job for the MTV shows.  Like set dressing?  Yeah.  Where the couches don't have backs?  It's nothing but a facade.  My whole house, just a facade.  But it'll look awesome.  Look great from one angle.  You just won't be able to sit down.  I don't know.  It's gonna take so long to put furniture in this place, and I don't know what to do.  Just hire a chick.  Hire a chick.  I'm telling you.  Hire...  I had...  Like, when we were interviewing people, I had this gay guy come in, and I swear 
[01:01:00]  to God, he actually was like, I just got back from Costa Rica, and I'm thinking  of, like, this third world motif.  Great.  Get out.  Exactly.  I was like, dude, that's why I left Central America.  Yeah, yeah.  It sucked.  You don't want to...  Wait, what the hell was he talking about?  Little kids ask you for money as you walk from the bathroom to the kitchen.  Poverty.  That's great.  It's like a banana tree.  Yeah.  Someone getting a Colombian necktie in your dining room. 
[01:01:30]  And a family going, for only 38 cents, one day, for only 38 cents, holding out their  hands, by the way, I really appreciate this discussion on today.  Oh, the day that Opie's homeless?  Yeah.  Thanks.  It's his first day as a homeless guy.  Thank you.  This is just great.  What's the big deal?  His apartment has black mold in it.  Black mold and floods and mice and...  See, if you were a beaner, you'd have family here, and 10 people would have called you already  to hook you up with a room.  See, my people would have hooked you up, dude. 
[01:02:00]  I would never be homeless.  That's why you never see homeless beaners, ever.  Ever.  Ben offered his couch to me.  I'm like, oh, yeah, great.  Thanks.  See what I'm saying?  Thanks for nothing.  And then I get all the people calling, like, hey, man, whatever you need.  Whatever you need, I'll do it for you.  Shut up.  We all say that, but no one means...  What do you need, man?  What do you need?  No one means, dude, you know you can count on me.  Whatever I could do, just let me know.  That is the biggest BS, and we all do it. 
[01:02:30]  And they're not hooking you up with it?  Oh, the pictures are online.  Oh, they are?  Your black mold pictures?  Yeah, go to opianthony.com.  You got to describe some of these pictures maybe later today there, E-Rock.  There you go.  There are the pictures online.  Of the flooded basement, the water and sewage on the floor, the work crew ripping up the walls,  finding black mold.  It's all there for your viewing pleasure, opianthony.com.  Speaking of the Internet, I just want to welcome aboard a brand-new member of the PalTalk community. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  Of course, you know we have PalTalk.  Yeah.  It's a video conferencing thing, so we have multiple cameras in the studio.  And then you at home can have a camera on you, and you get to watch us here in the studio.  You get to listen in on what we're doing.  For free.  You get to listen in on what we're doing here during commercial breaks.  So you hear a lot of the banter going back and forth that no one else can hear.  You're not going to – is it the same person I'm looking at? 
[01:03:30]  Dude, I would like to welcome aboard XM's own Elo, who is now a member of the PalTalk community.  There he is.  And he admits openly that he's an O&A pest himself.  He's a pest, and he is right in there in the trenches with the pests.  He is a true blue guy.  What's that room he's in?  It says M seeking M.  Yeah.  During the show is one thing. 
[01:04:00]  It's fun to see Elo with the pests hanging out.  He's doing his job.  He's working and hanging with the pests.  But what is Elo going to be doing, like, maybe after a few cocktails at 2.30 in the morning?  He's giving a thumbs up.  We can't have Eric Logan get fired.  Look, Eric, there's something called screen capping.  They can capture your image like a photograph.  So anything you're going to do, keep your face off camera.  Our careers – we count on this guy for our careers. 
[01:04:30]  He's the most important guy in our careers since we came back to him.  Oh, great.  Look at him.  Don't get into something.  It's just a matter of time before he's going to be showering for everybody in the morning.  So Elo shower.  You just watch where this goes.  Don't get into something that they call jack cam because that's something that could get you in a lot of trouble.  Well, he's got his fast food microphone on, so he's getting stuff done.  He's watching the news down there.  Yeah, he's keeping informed.  He's in his office. 
[01:05:00]  He's got his headset on.  He's hanging with the pests.  What a guy, you know?  It's that guy in the corner over there?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's our boss.  That's our boss right there.  Yeah, right on.  He watches us.  We watch him.  It's nice.  Big brother.  Elo, welcome aboard.  Elo's now a pal talking.  And he's in the Opie and Anthony room?  Of course he is.  All right, let's say hi to Frank in Dallas.  Frank, what's up?  I'm okay.  Hi, you Frank the Frowner.  I once had a dream that I had sleep paralysis of the mouth.  This isn't Frank the Frowner, unfortunately. 
[01:05:30]  Well, we're talking to Frank the Frowner in studio.  Hold on a second.  Oh, oh, put Frank on.  You once had a dream that your mouth was paralyzed?  Yes.  I walk around the hall and I couldn't smile.  Then I realized that I was wide awake.  My eyes only open.  Wow.  Any...  I wish they could see your face.  That's the best part of that impression.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Everybody is so missing the facial part.  That is so awesome.  That's what's good about pal talk and the pictures we put up on the internet.  Yeah, we got video and pictures of Frank the Frowner on opandanthony.com as well. 
[01:06:00]  Frank, it takes...  Any facts about...  You know, it takes more muscles to frown than it's just to smile.  I was once told by a den master who was fondling me.  He always gets that info from the weirdest sources.  That's really strange.  I never really get that, but...  All right, we got Frank in Dallas.  Frank, what's up?  Okay, guys.  You guys know Carlos Mencia is not even Mexican, right?  Uh, no, I know. 
[01:06:30]  He's from Norway, as a matter of fact.  Yeah.  He's from Norwegian.  He's from Honduras.  The Viking.  Yes.  His name's not even Carlos.  It's Ned.  He says that.  Yeah, we know.  My God, you're coming up with facts that I can't believe.  See...  Ned, get out!  Dude, yeah, he says that.  And, Frank, we got to say goodbye to you because we hate when people call.  It says on the comments here, saw Carlos' show on Sunday.  It was awesome.  That's how you got through, and now you want to just... 
[01:07:00]  Frank's trying to be a tattletale with something everyone knows.  Dude, I hate to tell you this, but Opie's real name is Greg.  Stop!  All right, listen, we got...  Do you know Frank the Frowner is Jimmy Norton?  I was actually on Conan last night talking about this.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, see, maybe that's where he found out.  Yeah, that's right.  I heard him say it.  I heard some Mexican guy on Conan saying that...  That he's not Mexican.  His name is Ned.  It was mean, stupid.  All right, here's the deal. 
[01:07:30]  It's not even like Nedito.  Nedito.  Nothing like that.  It's just Ned.  You know what?  That's what sucks.  That is not even like Neduardo.  Neduardo.  Which would be a good one, right?  Neduardo would be a good one.  No, it's Ned.  Something.  No, just straight up.  Ned is somebody that was, you know, generations born here in America, drives a tractor.  No, Ned was the beaner that got his ass beat in East L.A. for having a white  name.  That's what Ned was.  Yeah.  Hence, Carlos.  My name's Carlos.  Stop hitting me.  Stop playing you.  Stop beating the crap out of me.  Gene Simmons doesn't use his real name.  I mean, it's not...  You don't have Gene Simmons.  His real name is... 
[01:08:00]  Carlos Mencia.  No, it's not.  Carlos is another guy.  No, this one's even better.  Say that again.  His real name is Hayim something.  Hayim?  Yes.  Gene Klein was the name he used in New York.  He couldn't be more Jewish.  But Hayim, he's from Israel.  He's Israeli.  It was...  Gene?  Yes, he is Israeli.  It was Hayim something.  I can't remember if he was Israeli.  Did he serve in the military over there?  I think he was very young.  Or did he get out beforehand?  You don't know how Jewish he is until you start talking about terrorism.  Yeah, I had that discussion with him one time.  Or the fact that he sells everything.  Yeah.  The fact that he is one of the most successful businessmen with the kiss, selling everything 
[01:08:30]  kiss and hunting down people that try to sell kiss items without his permission.  He sells every...  Dude, he sells JBL of kiss memorabilia.  Yes.  He's got coffins.  Say no more.  But they sell.  I know they do.  That's the crazy part about that.  Listen, we've got to take a break and catch up.  We're really late today.  We've got Big A and Twitchels.  They're coming in next to do the news.  This is really cool.  Carl Smith is in studio for the rest of the show. 
[01:09:00]  And he's playing the O&A Traveling Virus.  This O&A Traveling Virus is picking up steam.  It's all the comedians you know and love from our show.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.  All the info is on opianthony.com.  We've got three dates so far.  I think we're going to be announcing Cleveland soon, hopefully.  And we've got a special today.  Do you know anything about this?  Did they tell you this?  Well, because I called them up and I said, you know, what about all the poor people?  Right.  They were like...  You said, what about the beaners?  Let's be honest.  All right.  That's what I said.  I said, what about the beaners?  The ones that are like, my love opianthony, but I don't have $30 to pay. 
[01:09:30]  So they were like, do something special.  So 1,000 tickets will be sold at $9.23.  And that will only be two extra parking spaces.  Thank you.  Wow.  All right.  Very good.  I'm a little slow.  I'm still catching up on my sleeve.  That is good.  I've heard that joke before by some guy named Ned.  Ned.  Here's the deal.  This is for the New York area.  The station we're on here in New York is Free FM 92.3. 
[01:10:00]  So the deal is, it's the Carl's Mencia gift ticket.  1,000 tickets available for the Travel and Virus Tour at the PNC Bank Arts Center on Saturday,  August 26th is the date.  Tickets priced at just $9.23.  But it's only 1,000.  It's only the next 1,000 tickets sold starting at 10 a.m. this morning.  I think you can only get this deal today and tomorrow.  That is it.  How much are they?  $9.23 to see the ONA Travel and Virus here in New York.  Actually in Jersey, PNC.  We're on 92.3. 
[01:10:30]  That is a coincidence that it worked out here in New York.  Really?  That worked out really.  You mean I just pulled that $9.23 out of my ass and it actually worked?  Yes, it did.  The tickets will go on sale starting at 10 a.m. this morning at all Ticketmaster outlets.  Also through the Internet, of course, okay?  $9.23.  We've got 1,000 of these tickets going up at 10 a.m. this morning for the ONA Travel and Virus.  More with Carl's Mencia.  It's the ONA Virus spreading across America.  Opie Anthony Dance Party Weekend. 
[01:11:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah, nah.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Comedy gone too far.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony!  Yeah, we got Carlos Mencia in studio today.  They changed the time and the day of the show, right?  Yeah, we're moved to Sundays.  Mind of Mencia.  After a couple of new runs of Chappelle. 
[01:11:30]  Did you watch the Chappelle Show?  I actually saw a couple skits.  I didn't see the whole thing yet, but what I saw I really liked.  It was funny, man.  What time are you guys on?  What was that?  What time?  We're on at 10 o'clock.  Cool.  Yeah.  10 o'clock Sunday.  Sunday nights.  Mind of Mencia.  All right.  I watched the other comedy channel, Fox News.  Because last night I found something that had me cracking up.  We got the audio of it. 
[01:12:00]  This is Fox News at its best.  And I won't just blame Fox.  A lot of the news organizations don't know what the hell they're doing.  This whole thing that's going on now in the Middle East with Israel and Lebanon.  A feeding frenzy.  A media feeding frenzy.  They love it.  So they're all over there with their cameras and more reporters and flak jackets and everything.  So Fox and Friends.  Very respected news program.  Very respected news show.  In the morning.  They go from like a pie fight to death in the streets.  And they call it news. 
[01:12:30]  They're interviewing one of their reporters that are on the Gaza Strip.  He's on this road that is completely desolate and deserted.  He then starts talking about the situation at hand and has his cameraman zoom in on some hidden Israeli tanks.  Why don't we just play the clip and you can see what fun starts from there.  And this is normally a very busy roadway.  This is Salah Adin Street.  This is the main artery that cuts through the Gaza Strip that goes from the very bottom to the very top of the Strip. 
[01:13:00]  And as you can see for yourself, it is a ghost town at this hour.  Not a single car is on this road.  There's a reason.  The reason for that the Israelis have effectively now they have cut Gaza in half.  There is a strong Israeli presence here.  The first time there are Israeli troops in Gaza since the withdrawal last summer.  And just over my shoulder, off in the distance, you can't see it in camera range, there are Israeli tanks.  Now let me zoom in and give away the Israeli positions. 
[01:13:30]  Some military activity, some shelling.  And for that reason, as you point out, we are wearing the flak jackets.  All right, there's the setup.  There he goes.  He has, in essence, right then, given away the Israeli tank positions.  They're under cover.  You can tell.  They zoom in.  You see the bottom of the tracks, but they're hidden.  They don't want to be seen.  They are tanks.  It's very hard to hide a tank.  They're good enough to do it.  And Fox News has now effectively blown their cover. 
[01:14:00]  And it doesn't take long because everyone monitors the news stations when you're at war.  That's the new intelligence gathering.  The enemy, a friend, foe, everybody.  So it doesn't take long before the Israelis realize these guys are blowing up our spot.  And they kind of, well, let these guys know they're not happy.  Well, they might have just seen the news camera over there.  They might have just seen those guys down there.  And they might have just seen dummy gesturing.  And they might have just seen they're filming what we're doing.  Yeah, filming what we're doing, our position, whatever.  But they kind of let them know that they're not happy. 
[01:14:30]  Militants in Gaza today did continue to launch rockets from the northern part of the Strip  over the border into nearby Israeli towns.  And, whoa, we just got fired at.  Take that with you.  Take that with you.  Pack your crap and leave.  Why don't you take this with you?  I could just picture some Israeli just sitting there with a scope going, watch this guy.  Watch this guy. 
[01:15:00]  I'm just going to hit the street around him.  Could have blown his head off.  Believe me.  Could have blown his head clean off.  It was always quiet.  He gives away their position.  And then like a minute or so later.  Now they're shooting at him.  They're shooting at the reporter and the cameraman.  This is what you get for giving away our position.  The vehicle, everything.  Just shooting all around him in the street.  You hear like the boom, boom, boom.  And then the anchors.  I got to start this clip over.  Yeah, now the anchors from the safe newsroom start giving him advice.  Yeah, this isn't Cronkite.  This isn't Rather, you know, broadcasting from Vietnam. 
[01:15:30]  This is Fox and Friends.  In the morning.  Yeah.  With the happy, peppy.  Right.  Morning show.  Trying to tell him now.  Trying to give him advice.  What to do when you're under fire from thousands of miles away with a four-second delay.  They're going to help this guy out.  It's raining bullets.  And speaking of rain.  Yeah.  Let's go to the weather here.  It's going to be dry today.  Let's get back to the clip.  Militants in Gaza today did continue to launch rockets from the northern part of the Strip 
[01:16:00]  over the border into nearby Israeli towns.  And, whoa, we just got fired at.  That's the end of it for us here.  I think you can still hear us.  No, keep talking.  Do what you need to do.  We're still on the satellite here.  David, do what you need to do.  Where are you right at?  Someone did fire a...  Yes?  Are you...  David, go ahead.  You see the camera shot, don't you guys?  Right.  Get into a safe place.  Oh, thanks.  That's helpful.  Yeah, we're actually hunkered down now behind our vehicle. 
[01:16:30]  I was standing doing jumping jacks.  But it's difficult to ascertain who fired that shot.  It sounded like a single shot.  Hey, we're hiding behind this big car.  Fox News alert.  If you're under fire, you should take cover.  It's a Fox News alert exclusive.  If you're in the middle of the desert, hide behind a car.  This just in.  If you're on an empty street and the Israelis shoot at you, find something to hide behind. 
[01:17:00]  Jackass, of course.  Oh, take cover.  Do what you have to do.  They gave great advice back there at Fox and Friends.  You want to continue with this?  Is this going to put off our Emeril Lagasse segment?  I like the way she was like, wait, wait, wait.  Let me get, hey.  Yeah.  Do what you have to do.  Do what you have to do.  In the middle of all that.  Oh, I almost feel like I'm there.  Yeah, sure.  I really don't need your help.  Thank you.  I think I know duck and cover.  I think I can figure it out.  You can hear the people in the studio actually yell, zips on the wire, zips on the wire. 
[01:17:30]  Want to continue with this?  Oh, hell yeah.  The quiver was the best, though, when he said, we, we, we.  You know what?  He was a little quiver in the.  I don't care how tough you are when you're being shot at.  That's why I like Geraldo.  No, Geraldo would have still been like, oh, we just got fired at.  Geraldo would have stayed there.  This just in.  Geraldo, I am being shot at and I don't care.  Wow.  He's a tough guy.  I'm returning fire.  Thank God the bullet lodged in my mustache. 
[01:18:00]  I'm going to hide behind my mustache.  You know, eventually one of these guys will get shot on live TV.  On live TV and it will be a pleasure to watch.  All right.  The next clip, reporter scrambling and he's asking the question, who fired at me?  Yeah.  Hey.  But, Cohen.  It's okay.  Someone's firing.  I think we are going to boogie out of here.  But, as we do that, as we, before we just rush into the car, we don't want to make any  sudden movements here either.  We're going to get into the vehicle, guys. 
[01:18:30]  Okay, hold on.  David, get in the car.  Get in the car.  Go.  We'll come back to you later.  We're in the vehicle.  You know.  Sounds like me and my girlfriend playing Grand Theft Auto.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  They're shooting.  I like that noise.  I'm getting in the car.  Hey.  Get in the car.  Get in the car.  Get out the core.  Get out the core.  Okay.  It's difficult to tell who is firing at us.  Again, I don't know if we're still up on the satellite.  David, is that an armored car? 
[01:19:00]  Well, we're ahead.  We can over.  We are in an armored car.  And it affords us a great degree of protection.  Another concern that we do have in this location is that overhead, we can hear off in the distance.  And, again, it's difficult to ascertain how far in the distance there is an Israeli drone  aircraft.  And it is from those aircrafts that the Israelis have launched a number of these airstrikes.  So, that is an additional concern that we have.  Yeah, getting a bomb dropped on you.  From this location.  So, again, I don't know how far away that gunfire was. 
[01:19:30]  Even if it was Israeli gunfire.  If it was.  It's difficult for us to say.  It could be just someone with a weapon.  Could be someone with a weapon.  Let me tell you something, idiot.  If there are two Israeli tanks, there ain't no friggin' sniper that's going to open up  on you and give away his position knowing that those turrets are going to turn around  and blast whatever building he's in.  It was the Israelis shooting at you.  Firing over your stupid head.  You can pretty much guarantee it was the Israelis. 
[01:20:00]  It's not some stupid Hezbollah guy firing at the Fox guy when there's two Israeli tanks  sitting off to the side.  I think you're not going to quite be that stupid.  Unbelievable.  Stephen for Basher, a Fox should have disguised a news car as a falafel truck.  Fantastic.  Hey, let's say hi to Mike in Ohio.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, that same situation happened in Cleveland a few years ago.  Yeah?  Some guy took over some business school with a bunch of guns and the SWAT teams kept pulling  up, getting ready, and the news was showing the SWAT teams where they were setting up. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  The cops finally yelled at him and said, hey, asshole, get out of here.  Yeah, it's been happening forever.  The bad guys like watching TV, too.  That happened at the Olympics, the 72 Olympics.  Munich.  Munich, yeah.  That happened.  The news started showing the commandos getting up on the rooftops, and the hostage takers were  watching.  You can't, you know, these news guys, you want to shoot them.  Hey, go ahead.  It was like the Times giving away certain information on wiretapping that was...  Yeah.  They're just scumbags. 
[01:21:00]  And you should be shut out of...  If you say, we're going to boogie out of here.  We're going to boogie out of here.  Are you?  You deserve a bull to the ass.  Go ahead.  Do a little dance and moonwalk out of there.  Yeah, right?  Boogie out.  I'm going to boogie out.  Are we live?  Are we live?  I'm just going to bullshit out of here.  Well, we're going to boogie out of here.  So, can we get some Saturday Night Fever?  Yeah.  There you go.  Or some Michael Jackson.  We're going to just moonwalk backwards out of this situation.  Don't shoot my hair.  Right.  He always shoots my hair. 
[01:21:30]  Hey, we're going to boogie out of here.  Yo, me, Double J, the cameraman.  You're never shooting me, Tony.  Big platform shoes.  They shot me in my platform shoes.  Oh, my God.  Maybe I was just filming you because I thought she was dead. 
[01:22:00]  Boogie on out of here.  Yeah, go boogie.  What an ass.  Boogie on out of here.  Then all of a sudden, you see he's wearing the shoes with the big goldfish on the bottom.  Yeah, goldfish in the heels.  He is boogieing out of there, isn't he?  Wow.  He is boogieing.  And he's good at it, too.  Hey, Derek, what's up?  They've shot out our disco ball.  This could mean we can't boogie out.  The drone's got a disco ball on it.  We might have to rock on out of here.  You didn't hear Cronkite saying that. 
[01:22:30]  The president's been shot.  They are boogieing on out of here, passing the Stemmons freeway sign.  Walter Cronkite broadcasting live from the Tet Defensive.  North Vietnam has launched one of the large shots.  I'm going to boogie on out of here.  Boogie on out.  Actually, it's before boogieing, really.  I think I'm just going to do the monkey or the shuffle.  Shuffling off out of here.  I'm going to twist on out of here.  Let's twist again like we did last summer. 
[01:23:00]  I'm twisting out.  I'm twisting out of here.  I'm twisting out of Vietnam.  Trying to invade.  Bullets, bullets, bullets, bullets.  Let's twist again like Jackie did when those shots were fired.  The whole crew has to do the electric slide out of there.  Hey, Derek, what's up?  Oh, my God.  You guys have just earned you a new listener.  I swear to God. 
[01:23:30]  That is the funniest thing.  I almost rear-ended a car.  Awesome.  I just hope the pay is worth it.  Whatever those guys get paid, I hope one of them do get shot.  Oh, when they're just getting shot at.  But they're getting shot at for being stupid.  For being stupid.  It's not like they're getting shot.  Like, there's a tank that's purposely high.  Somebody made a tarp.  Some Pakistani guy or some.  You know what I mean?  Some little Chinese kid.  Went out of his way.  Yeah.  How big does this tarp have to be?  As big as a tank. 
[01:24:00]  Exactly.  You idiot.  Because we hide tanks.  And he hit the tank.  And these jackasses.  He's giving it away.  It's like when they go to the border and they point out the illegal aliens.  It's like, dude.  You know, you could hear in Spanish the guy going,  ¿Qué estás haciendo?  Why are you pointing the camera over here?  It's like, come on, guy.  You're the story.  It's stupid.  There you go.  We're going to be electric sliding out of here. 
[01:24:30]  Out of Vietnam.  Do it very slowly.  Do it very slowly.  Don't look too conspicuous.  To the front.  To the front.  Left, left.  It's electric.  By the way, before we get.  That's live.  Before we get back into the audio, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know where the O&A Pes are attacking that morning show in Houston.  Walton and Johnson.  Yeah.  And they're doing it through the Pal Talk room.  Well, Kyle from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  He has an update. 
[01:25:00]  Hey, Elo just got on the air at the Walton and Johnson show.  Oh, my God.  Saying he owns a strip club called Ramones.  That's the guy in charge of programming at XM Satellite Radio.  He has nothing better to do than help the Pes with an attack this morning.  Bravo.  Bravo.  All right.  Getting back to the audio here.  Yeah.  So now the anchors speculate on what happened.  Yeah.  Now they're speculating.  And they will finally get back to him and get a recap.  And then the piece de resistance of this whole thing.  We never got to the breakdancing. 
[01:25:30]  I thought we were going to breakdance out of there.  Yeah, a little breakdance.  Come on.  I'm doing the worm out of here.  I'm doing the worm out of here.  We got a pop lock out of here.  Wait a minute.  I'm in a box.  I'm in a box.  I can't go with you.  Uh-oh.  Lay down the cardboard.  We got a head spin out of here.  Oh, my God.  They're shooting at us.  It's time to do some crunking.  I can crunk.  And the Hindenburg coming into Lakehurst, New Jersey.  What a sight.  This huge airship coming over it.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's burst into flames. 
[01:26:00]  The people are burning.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, please.  Please.  Just do the foxtrot out of there.  Do the...  Please.  Get out of the...  Oh, the humanity dancing out of the way.  The people doing the funky chicken are getting out of the burning fire.  The burning...  Look at that chicken go.  Get a boogie on out of here, you ass-porters.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[01:26:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  The Latinos are dancing their salsa.  Look at that move Julio just put on Maria.  I am doing the cha-cha because it is on fire.  I am cha-cha because I'm on fire.  I'm going to spit my ass out of here.  Yeah, boy. 
[01:27:00]  Hands.  Yeah.  Put your hands up.  Start a Congo line.  Yeah, what is that?  That's a groovy.  What is that?  Baby, hands up.  Give me your heart.  Uh, we're going to hands up, hands up out of here.  Just put your hands up and get back in the vehicle.  Oh, these jackasses.  Oh, good.  Let's get out of here. 
[01:27:30]  All right, we've got to get back to the audio here.  So now the anchors speculate on what happened to this guy.  Yeah.  So at this time, guys, what I'd like to do is communicate with my photographer  and see if we can get him to safety.  And Pierre, are we going to get in the vehicle here?  And very slowly, but deliberately.  You know you're in trouble when your driver's name is Pierre.  Yeah.  We still hear shots.  We're going to take our camera down, guys, and we're going to talk to you from a safer  position.  We're going to go.  Just leave it there.  The Israelis will take it down for you.  Exactly.  Near central Gaza, where, as he was delivering his live report just a moment ago, heard some 
[01:28:00]  incoming very close.  It's interesting, as we look at these pictures, and I'm sure the pictures are going to get taken  down in just a minute as this cameraman puts the camera, and there it goes, into the trunk  of their vehicle to skedaddle out of there.  Most probably, they select a particular location to do the live report because it seemed safe  because, as he said, nobody was around, but obviously somebody was nearby with some sort 
[01:28:30]  of weapon.  A gun!  They were there.  And as soon as we have word that he is clear, we will pass it on to you, but they're getting  out of there.  He's shooting at the press, too.  He's wearing a flak jacket that says, press right on it.  Good.  God, if you're not supposed to.  You're a long ways away, and you just see something, and you don't know who it is, sometimes  you just start shooting.  No, the press should get shot at.  Absolutely.  That's why he was shooting, because he was pressed.  You guys get no respect.  And that's why his head didn't explode like a watermelon, because he had press.  Believe me, they were shooting around him.  Well, that guy was skedaddling.  Yeah.  A bunch of douches. 
[01:29:00]  Skedaddle.  Oh, they're firing.  We have to amscray.  We're going to make like trees and leave.  I can't.  I can't.  23 skedoo.  Yes, I said Congo instead of Congo.  He had to exit.  Stage left.  Stage left, Ethan.  Exit.  Stage right, Ethan.  We're being shot at.  Time to skedaddle.  El Caban.  We got more clips.  You want to keep going?  Come on, please.  They didn't do the little. 
[01:29:30]  The Fred Flintstone.  The Fred Flintstone.  Twinkle, tall, jab.  All right, here's the deal.  Now the guy's back in the car, and he thinks the Israelis shot at him.  It was probably Israeli fire.  We were a few hundred yards away from their position.  They were just out of camera range.  And I think they wanted us to move.  You think?  And I think this was more to scare us, because you have to understand the context of what's  happening here.  We pull up in a large vehicle, an armored car, even though it doesn't look armored. 
[01:30:00]  And there's concern, perhaps on the Israeli side, that our camera could be some type of a weapon.  We've had similar incidents in other locations.  It is a weapon.  It's giving away locations.  That's why we like to move very slowly and very deliberately, and not to startle anyone.  And in the middle of the live shot, you heard one shot.  I heard it.  I don't know if it was audible on the microphone.  And then when we got behind the vehicle, which is armored, we heard a few additional shots as well.  And that's when we decided it was time to leave. 
[01:30:30]  But in all likelihood, that was probably Israeli fire.  We were very, very close to their position.  And everyone here is extremely, extremely tense.  I can tell you this.  This is the last time I begin a live report telling Brian that the situation is very quiet.  That's the best part, though.  He started his report by saying how quiet it was. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  It's so quiet here.  Why do you think?  There's two tanks.  All right.  Now we got...  He didn't want to say that was the Israelis going, hey, faggot, beat it.  Yeah.  Leave.  Yeah, but he never mentions, you know, I give away the location of...  I know.  Camouflage vehicles.  They figured that out later on.  Someone has suggested we play the Benny Hill music over the guy getting shot at.  Well, that would be good.  I don't think we should make light of it.  After break.  You got to hear the...  All right.  Let's get the female anchor talking about war. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Or the segue.  They're both pretty good.  The segue is the best, though.  If we only have time for one, just do the segue.  We'll go late.  What the heck?  Female anchor talks war.  David Lee, you had said that that area, in your opinion, had been deserted.  Why were the Israelis there?  Was that just maintaining a position, some sort of a backup position?  What the Israelis have essentially done, Edie, is they've cut Gaza in half, and they have  stopped all traffic on this part of the major roadway that moves from the top of the Gaza 
[01:32:00]  Strip to the bottom of the Gaza Strip.  And this is an area that the Israelis have a strong military presence in, and all traffic  has stopped in this one location.  It's not far from at least one of the Israeli settlements.  There are other settlements nearby.  This is central Gaza.  So for that reason, the area is deserted.  The Palestinians know not to go any further.  There are barriers set up.  We went as close as we felt we could to illustrate what was taking place here without endangering 
[01:32:30]  ourselves.  Give away their position.  Yeah.  And I think we may have gone just a little too far.  You were doing reconnaissance.  Thanks so much.  Glad you're safe.  And we're going to need you again.  So I'll check with you again.  Thanks again, David.  That stupid woman.  If a woman's going to talk, just talk about what women know.  Why do you think the Israelis there?  Was there a toilet to be cleaned?  A meal to be cooked?  Did the men need some coffee?  A baby to be burped?  Stick to what you know is stupid.  Back to the studio.  Perhaps we got a little too close. 
[01:33:00]  We got to hurry up.  Back to the studio.  Here's the awful segment we're talking about.  Yeah, listen to this.  Now, after all this drama has happened, they can't resist but to be the same stupid news  people that they always are.  It's scary.  But I still don't understand.  It's his press.  That's the color.  That's international.  Bad guys shoot at anything.  Right.  But it's Israel.  But it's also, if he's correct, again, we don't know who exactly is shooting at him, but  the other guys there are trying to protect themselves.  Completely shifting gears.  Are you a rotten speller? 
[01:33:30]  My colleague was just shot at.  Are you a rotten speller?  Wow.  How do you spell bullets?  Yeah.  Maybe they didn't spell press right.  Yeah, maybe that is it.  Right, right.  You know, don't put Palestinian when you mean to put press.  Press.  H-A-M-A-S.  Press spelled Hezbollah.  What are you talking about?  Don't you get it?  Oh, we're going to have a spelling bee winner coming up on our show next week.  Oh, my God.  That's the... 
[01:34:00]  What are you talking about if you spell a-la-la-la-la on your jacket?  That is that horrid news segue.  The word is savage.  Can you use it as a sentence?  Have you ever been, Jim, have you ever been on a TV show like that where they go from that  tragic moment and then to the comedy of you?  Has that ever happened to you?  Yeah, be funny.  Yeah, but I've had bad segues from news in Baltimore.  Because I've actually had like 30 people shot and blah, blah, blah.  And now the comedy of Carlos Mencia, I've actually had that happen. 
[01:34:30]  It's like, who came up with this?  Who thought that this was a good segue?  It's unbelievable.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We're really late.  Carlos Mencia in studio.  We've got something really cool happening with Carlos Mencia.  He's playing the old...  Wait a minute!  We're going to skedaddle.  I've got a salsa out of here.  They're shooting at me, everybody.

Millicent in Gaza today did continue to launch rockets from the northern part of the Strip  over the border into nearby Israeli towns.  And, whoa, we just got fired at the end of it for us here.  I think, I don't know if you guys can still hear us.  I guess we're still on the satellite here.  David, do what you need to be to keep.  Someone did fire a...  Yes?  David, go ahead.  You see the camera shot, don't you guys? 
[01:36:00]  Right.  You get into a safe place.  I think it did.  It sounded...  Yeah, we're actually hunkered down now behind our vehicle.  It sounds so dangerous.  We're hunkered down.  Who fired that shot?  It sounded like a single shot.  And there you have it.  I've got a bald guy that Benny used to pat his head.  Right.  All right.  We've got a break.  Taz is joining the program next.  And we do the news with Big A and Twitchels as well.  Right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's time for another Opie and Anthony show.

[01:37:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, man.  We've got a very busy studio.  But first, we've got to say hi to Paul.  Paul's coming in on Monday.  We just want to make sure he's definitely doing this.  Paul.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  So you're definitely coming in Monday?  There's nothing short of death that's keeping me from being there.  All right, cool.  We've got $1,000 a day to give away all next week, courtesy of Clerks 2, I believe. 
[01:37:30]  Yes.  The gang at Clerks 2, the movie, obviously coming out, I think, next Friday.  They gave us $1,000 a day for all of next week.  And, Paul, you're the first victim.  Yeah.  You're going to come in on Monday.  You're going to get your back waxed.  Yeah, exactly right?  Wow.  Serious?  But not just the normal one.  I've actually already picked up the glue traps and everything.  All right, yeah, back waxing sucks to begin with. 
[01:38:00]  He's going to do it with mouse glue traps.  Those glue traps that they get stuck in.  Dude, those are the worst, man.  Yeah, yeah.  I bought one of those one time, and then a mouse actually got stuck in it, but it wasn't dead.  It was alive trying to get out.  Like it's stuck in a tar pit.  Yeah.  They don't tell you on the packaging that you're going to have to smash the mouse over  the head with a hammer.  They starve to death.  That's how they kill them.  No, you have to kill them.  See, stupid me, I got the mousetraps, the glue mousetraps, and I thought there maybe was 
[01:38:30]  some kind of toxin on there that got them.  No, it's in your walls.  And so they got stuck.  No.  I felt bad.  They'll live for days starving to death and gnawing at their own freaking legs to get  loose.  And to feed them.  And then they roll over, and now they're on their back alive.  It's horrific.  They don't tell you you have to kill them.  Did you try to peel it off?  No.  They don't come off.  I actually tried.  Oh, no.  Yes.  What came off?  Yes.  What came off? 
[01:39:00]  His hair.  Like half a mouse?  Yes, half a mouse came.  Because I was trying to save its life.  Like I wasn't pissed off that it was alive.  I was pissed off it was in my house.  So I'm like trying to take it out.  And then I pulled hard thinking, you know, and the skin stayed there.  And yeah, I was like, man.  That's the worst.  They got it.  What a great gag.  They put that on a girl's tampon.  We'll do it on April 1st.  Ha ha.  Got you.  Ow.  So Paul, you're coming in on Monday, and you're going to get your back waxed with the 
[01:39:30]  glue mouse traps.  Sure am.  All right.  Very cool.  We'll see you on Monday.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  There you go.  Also, we got to say hi to Taz.  Taz is in the studio.  Taz.  Our old friend.  What's up?  All 5,000 guys in the studio.  What's up, everyone?  Yeah.  They're acting here.  What is this?  I don't know.  Many people.  All men.  We got Carl's Mencia, Minor Mencia on Comedy Central.  What's up?  Taz, what are you promoting today?  Nothing.  Just hanging?  No, no.  You got the ECW thing?  I think we got ECW on SyFy tomorrow night, Saturday night's main event on NBC at 8 p.m. 
[01:40:00]  Eastern, so we'll be part of that.  ECW guys, Raw guys, SmackDown guys, so we'll get into that in a little while, but I mean,  why is there so many?  Who is this guy?  I don't know.  Who is this?  Oh, you've never seen these two.  No, help me out with this.  He's actually a wrestler.  He's called The Rapist.  You know what?  They have never.  That is really good.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  My mind's somewhere else.  It's a scary looking dude right there.  All right.  Well, Big A, why don't you say hi to Taz?  Listen to this, guys. 
[01:40:30]  Hi, Taz.  He doesn't sound intimidating all of a sudden.  How you doing?  What's up?  Hey, what's wrong with Taz's mic?  Yeah, why can't I hear myself either?  No, you just blew out that mic.  Yeah, it's all like tinny.  Is it me or does he look like the family guy?  Yeah, he's got a little of that.  He looks like a cartoon character in general that came to life.  And then, Twitchell's, why don't you say hi to Carlos Mencia and Taz?  Yo, what's up, guys?  What up? 
[01:41:00]  Mike's still out here or what?  You're sort of on.  Why would it work?  Why would we have a studio that actually works when we're talking to millions of people?  Twitchell's has Tourette's.  Is that what it is?  Oh, yeah.  Very good, Carlos.  That's correct.  Tourette's syndrome.  That's great.  And he's got it pretty bad.  Way to make the beaner feel uncomfortable.  He's got it pretty bad.  Today's actually a calm day.  Really?  Yeah.  We'll see how calm.  You get real nervous when you're on it.  Are you on medication?  No, it made me fat.  I was bigger than him when I graduated high school, so I got off to medicine. 
[01:41:30]  Way to throw him under the bus.  Wait, who are you?  Wait, who are you calling fat?  Look at this disaster.  Who called him fat?  Who, Taz or Big A?  Big A.  Oh, all right.  He's smart.  Oh, no, no.  I only make...  Way to throw him.  Come on.  Can we get a mic for Taz immediately?  Taz, get over there.  Way to make him the bus.  All right, get over there.  Let's try that mic.  Nobody knew he was fat.  Now they're like, how fat is this guy?  Really, he could...  Get Taz over in the corner.  You're not that fat.  You're a big guy, but you're not that fat. 
[01:42:00]  No, it's...  Yeah, he's not fat.  He's just...  It's his shape.  Well, it's his head.  Can you guys hear me now?  It looks like he's ready to have a great fall.  So did the medication work?  No, it's his head.  I'm sorry.  Did the medication work?  Yeah, it worked for a while.  I've been medicated since I was diagnosed when I was seven, but it made me retain weight.  I was 300 pounds when I graduated high school.  So you made a choice to be thin and to have the Tourette's instead of...  Yeah, right.  Instead of be fat.  Yeah, either be thinner and twitch more or obese and twitch the last. 
[01:42:30]  So I chose thinner and twitch more.  What would you do?  You still want to get laid, so I guess you got to go thin and twitch.  Yeah, that pushing won't hurt when you're talking to a chick.  Yeah, but you got...  You know, it's either that or really...  Or being real fat.  But can you get...  But do you get laid now?  Yeah, not a problem.  Yeah, no, why wouldn't it be?  Even a hooker wouldn't get in the car with that.  Hey, have a...  I don't mean to be an asshole.  I do well.  I'm not ragging.  It's kind of like an amusement park.  I mean, that's what it is. 
[01:43:00]  It's kind of like it's fun to watch.  Yeah.  Like a big thing.  You know, it's pretty funny.  Yeah, but who is it?  How do you close the deal?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  A ball-peen hammer.  You know what I'm saying?  I go to sleep.  I mean, there's good days and bad days.  Some days it's a lot calmer than others.  Like when you meet...  Day's a good day, you know?  No, but when you meet a chick, all right, you know, she's interested, whatever.  She hears you.  It's kind of like, hey, that's kind of cool.  You know?  But how do you actually close the deal?  Well, usually the first few seconds of meeting a chick, it's kind of like the puppy dog thing. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, that's sweet.  And then eventually some chicks it gets annoying fast.  Usually I'll say right away, I try to hope that doesn't bother you.  Jump.  And that issue, yeah.  OCD as well.  Do you ever, like, when you're out with a girl, she'll just jump into bed with you?  Uh, yeah, occasionally.  You like when women jump in bed with you, right?  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's got to jump. 
[01:44:00]  When he hears the word jump, because it's such a full word, jump.  Right.  He has to jump.  It just makes him feel good to actually jump after he hears jump.  Think about itching your face, Carlos, for like 10 seconds.  Eventually you feel the urge to do it.  Same thing.  I get you.  More stupid.  Jump around.  He was slapping himself at one point.  That was the best.  Jump.  I think if somebody, I miss those days.  If somebody were to yell out, pick fruit, I think I'd go down.  Pick fruit.  Stop.  Stop. 
[01:44:30]  All right, listen.  We want to get right into it.  We got Big A and Twitchels here to do the news.  We do this from time to time.  We haven't done it in a long, a long while.  So Twitchels has the Popeye Tourette's today.  He's got like one eye is going and he's going, one eye shuts, the mouth opens up.  I get the Tourette's.  I get Slade.  I get some.  Me, olives. 
[01:45:00]  Skinny bitch.  I'm weak to the finish because I spilled my spinach.  That's phenomenal.  Guys, sit back and enjoy.  It's Big A and Twitchels with the news.  Take it away, boys.  Oh, jeez.  Carving for the latest in local and world news stories.  Oh, Carlson, we've got to tell you. 
[01:45:30]  By the way.  He can't say ST words.  ST words.  So his whole script will be peppered with ST words.  Oh, he can't.  Yeah, the ST part of the word.  We'll drive him almost insane.  Watch his face.  He loses his mind.  Can I laugh?  You're supposed to.  Yes, you're supposed to.  That's the only reason they're here.  If he's not humiliated, it wasn't worth it.  They know they're here for that.  When Twitchels said he's having a calm day, I was ready to say just go home.  Oh, really?  A calm Twitchels is not worth anything to us.  Where's the Red Bull? 
[01:46:00]  All right, here we go.  So Big A, go ahead.  It's time.  For the news with Big A and Twitchels, I'm Big A.

[02:07:00]  over dramatizing something  uh i think that's what got  that guy in trouble on the  gaza strip he thought you  know because every other  story they got to exaggerate  to the umpteenth level that  you know hey i'm being  shot at wait a minute no  i'm really being shot at  i better leave  they're so used to be  exaggerating he didn't  he didn't say it like  that he went um  being fired upon  when do you think the  media changed the uh  the television media  because it wasn't like  that in the you know the  60s and part of the 70s 
[02:07:30]  well i mean a lot of that  is when we've talked about  this before is how many  options there are out there  now yeah i mean you know  it you have to work not to  see the news now in some  form either listening to  this show or turning on  the internet or something  so uh they've got to make  a read there's got to be  a reason for you to watch  um so maybe they have to  add some new graphics  maybe they have to have  some music maybe they have  to have an attractive woman  or man to get you to watch  a little more than you  would in the past  they're fighting for  eyeballs like everybody  else is uh and that's 
[02:08:00]  where it's changed a little  bit uh certainly cable news  um for all of its strengths  and its weaknesses has  changed the entire dynamic  you know back in the days  when we were kids you had  your six o'clock news you  had your eleven o'clock  news and everybody shut  down into the paper came  out in the morning now  you got cable news going  24 hours reporting  anything anywhere anytime  uh you know and they have  the ability to report it  report it sometimes wrong  yeah but it's all the same  everything's the same  oh yeah absolutely  cnn fox it's all the same  they know what they need i 
[02:08:30]  think cable news is a big  a and twitchels that's  right  that would be great  they've got huge ratings  absolutely people would  watch every night  it'd be different  you give us 22 minutes  we'll give you a half a  story  but will it be visually  entertaining  oh yeah  trust me it will be  yeah it will  can you have a shower on  that  uh well  i don't think you'd want  one no  if you sit under a big  A while he's talking  perhaps  hey well you know  the guy's feet are like 
[02:09:00]  bathtubs  so i mean you know  hey richard are you a fan  of the news improv  the news improv  yeah we've noticed this  of late  this is where uh  they go off the  teleprompter  in between reports  like uh the reporter  will do a story  they'll bring it back  to the desk  and they'll have banter  that isn't on the  teleprompter  uh huh  and it's so awkward  because they  they really don't seem  to have personalities  well uh you know  i think uh  in honestly i think  it works like when  bob sheifer's doing it  on the cbs evening news 
[02:09:30]  it doesn't work a lot  of times on the local  level because they're  not sure what the  other guy's gonna say  uh they're filling  times there are some  locals uh here  yeah we we found  one of the worst  is the uh weatherman  uh wood  uh what's his name  mike wood  mike woods  mike woods uh  is awful at  improvisation  he will try to  get this little  uh the little  thing going  repartee  yeah repartee  a little humorous  anecdote  or something  with the reporter  and he has  nothing  well look 
[02:10:00]  you guys do  this for hours  a day  uh and doing  live anything  is not easy  uh i'll be the  first to admit  that um  as you can see  right now  tell me about  uh  you're proving  that  so you know  and you're doing  it without a script  you're doing it  without a script  you know these  guys are usually  reading off a  teleprompter  when they go  off you know  they got a  producer in their  ear they're trying  to be funny  and smart  and then get  back onto the  script  uh so it's  yeah i know  the feeling  that in my job  because i have 
[02:10:30]  a similar situation  and believe it or not  as a wrestling  announcer it's  very similar  where you got  a producer in  your ear  you got  sometimes you  don't know  what a company  in your ear  you gotta listen  to your broadcast  paul  you're fired  exactly  and then you  gotta call the  action in the ring  and tell these  stories of the  guys  and it's  it's not  it's not  it's true  i mean with  radio with you  guys you gotta  be creative every  day every minute  but at least you  don't have a ton  of people in your  ear which makes  i think you should  know your strengths  and weaknesses  and not try to  go off on a tear  and try to then 
[02:11:00]  bring it around  to how it might  rain today  because he cannot  do that  that's a tough  segue  he's a horrid  at it  but those guys  have never had  personalities  they've never  had to  you gotta understand  that from the  beginning of your  newscasting career  that's all you do  is just read the  prompter  so all of a sudden  they're like  fill in the gap  but again  people like  Cronkite and stuff  were able to go  off that script  and do a little  editorializing  give you a little  more insight  into the story  these guys  are just nothing 
[02:11:30]  once that  teleprompter  goes dead  I'll blink  blink  get a lot of  here  you can see  their eyes  blink  we're losing  the shell here  we really are  thank you  Mind a Mencia  Comedy Central  Sunday nights  and don't forget  a thousand tickets  available for the  traveling virus tour  at PNC Bank  Art Center  on Saturday  August 26th  tickets priced  at $9.23  we got a thousand  of those to give  away starting at  10am this morning  through Ticketmaster  and all the info  is up on  opianthony.com  Taz real fast

[02:23:30]  by the completion  of the show  what the fuck  to do  I'm on the dump sheet  today  I'm so disappointed  and that was a legitimate  fuck up  right when I said it  I got that surprise  like  hot feeling  like  oh no  I cursed  usually when I curse  I  it's a very conscious  decision  to curse  I don't take it lightly  mind you  maybe a shit  but that F word 
[02:24:00]  or the C word  very important words  I can't do the dump report  without everybody here  I know we had guests too  I don't know where the fuck  they went  suck each other's cack  had fun on the elevator  Jimmy really made a  disturbance  hopefully  Sam was taping it  he was standing  a little too close  to a gentleman  and the gentleman  addressed that issue  and of course  Frank the Frowner  it's not Jimmy 
[02:24:30]  it's Frank the Frowner  had to  had to talk about that  never had more fun  in elevators  than in this very building  with our friend  Jimmy Norton  Jimmy was standing  a little too close  to another  one of the building  people  yeah  and the guy  brought it up  because it was  really embarrassing  Jimmy's ass  I actually didn't realize  I was that close to him  are you kidding  no no  I honestly didn't  I thought you were  completely joking  because you were  obscenely close to him  the guy had to point out  that the guy 
[02:25:00]  was right up  that Jimmy was  right up against  his junk  oh I didn't  I didn't realize  Jimmy's ass  was pushed against  the guy's cock  in the elevator  I didn't know  I was that close to him  usually on the elevator  but he packs in  as he's commenting  on  where is that music  coming from  you were atrocious  and hysterical  and hysterical  to be on an elevator  and that fat douche  he was really testy  he bumped into me  coming in too  that's why I didn't like him  because he bumped in  like walking through the doors  like when we were walking  in the building  he was like  you know  just a big fat guy  in a hurry  so he was asking 
[02:25:30]  oh he was just an asshole  he was asking  to have his cock  put up your ass  I didn't realize  I was that close  you know what  the fun thing about it is  when Jimmy goes off  in an elevator like that  you don't have to be part of it  so you're not embarrassed  but I kind of  because I turn around  and look in the mirrors  in the elevator  and I watch other people's reactions  and people don't know  what to do  like the black girl  that was in there  started laughing  when you talked about the music  and one gets on  and one gets on  we stop at a floor  a girl got on  and another girl  went off 
[02:26:00]  the elevator  and Jimmy goes  one gets on  one gets on  like stating the obvious  and the girl that got on  just kind of leaned  against the wall  and just starts laughing  like oh great  a fucking retard  yeah welcome to 1960  she's thinking right  I was on the elevator  with Twitchels man  and that's embarrassing  I thought  I mean if it's a gag  you know I'm always  for my world  I think everything's  bullshit  you know what I mean  so  yeah yeah  I mean  I think everybody's  working something  that's his gimmick  that's his gimmick  thank you  so you're trying to  figure it out 
[02:26:30]  yeah  and he's on the elevator  doing the whole thing  I'm thinking  these guys  he's trying to work me  the whole way through  but I don't know  I'm starting to buy into it  oh no he's really got it  yeah he's the real deal  because he'll sit out there  for hours  before we ever have him  on the show  we watch him through the glass  and he's just going off  if he is faking it  he deserves  every bit of attention  he gets  if you're that committed  yeah you're right  that's a good point  an Oscar nominee  absolutely  Louis Twitchell Santani  the great Santini  what was it  oh Santani  yeah the great Santani  that's funny  come on there

[02:31:00]  I fucking hate  comedy  and what's viewed  as funny  three of the places  that Lucky Louie  got completely trashed  gave this fucking  hunk of shit  good reviews  USA Today  smashed us  and this is what  they say about  the Wayne's Brothers  film  give the Wayne's Brothers  some credit  for a movie  that could have  fallen flat  on it's infantile face  man scores some  points  for thinking big  oh boy  you groveling  fucking faggots  in the media  Philadelphia Inquirer  at least in spurts 
[02:31:30]  little man  provide some big laughs  at least in spurts  does it  and Hollywood Reporter  a place I'd love  to put anthrax  in the fucking vents  you fucking  left wing cunt  although you'll likely  hate yourself  in the morning  for having succumbed  to the sophomore  silliness of it all  at the time  resistance proves  ridiculously futile  does it really  does it really  and these people  gave Lucky Louie  a negative review  of course they did  they smashed us 
[02:32:00]  these same things  and look  I like Marlon  Wayne  I think he's a good  actor  but this movie  has been shit on  by everybody  and the three  of the fucking places  we got really bad  reviews  and this was great  so go fuck yourselves  go fuck your ass  especially the Hollywood  Reporter  it's a sight gag  you're supposed to  know better  you cocksuckers  once it's over  the joke is done  yes  oh look  he's still little  at the end  of the fucking movie  it's 90 minutes in  does he die at the end  that'd be funny  now that would be funny  if his head exploded  if that'd be pretty funny 
[02:32:30]  or something like that  because they find out  he had progeria  and that's why  he was so small  or if his nose was stuffed  and he died  getting a mouth raping  from a Dominican  home invasion  he just mouth raped him  and his nose was too  stuffy to breathe  while he serviced  got picked up on  MySpace  found him in a shallow  grave somewhere  in Jordan  very shallow  see  cause he's short  you guys let's go  to General Bam  we gotta get in  oh the General  update here  General Bam  hey  attack's going well  we got a whole bunch 
[02:33:00]  of pets that have  gotten through so well  and they are now  back to attacking  Bill Burr again  oh good  why would they do this  I'll tell you why  they're two fucking  southern  wait hold on  catch me up  these are the guys  in Houston  yes  Johnson and Walters  they're trying to  these are two fucking  douchebag middle aged  nothings  phony  who are their phonies  and they're trying to  salvage their dignity  because they're having  their fucking balls  kicked in  you're having your  fucking balls kicked in  by our fans 
[02:33:30]  you dummies  can I answer a question  to all you guys  why you guys  I don't want you guys  to get upset with me  but these guys are  on the radar  with you guys  they're not even  in your fucking world  we don't care  no we don't do it  for that  when they bash  our pals  yeah we do it  for sport  nice  Bill Burr  they douched  Bill Burr  pretty good  he said he didn't  have a good appearance  I was on their show  I didn't have a good  appearance  well I could see that  I was doing my  impersonation  I do some good  I do the arrow  I was like hey  you're talking to me  I couldn't believe  it didn't go over  you'd think it was 
[02:34:00]  the real people  but Bill Burr  when he left  he found out  they were trashing him  so Bill fucking  smashed him  and we all  I smashed him too  because there's two  white guys  one of them  does three voices  a black guy  his own voice  a gay character  and a lady  and you're told  when you go in  don't acknowledge  that he's doing  different voices  oh that's natural  that's real  yeah that makes it  comfortable for a comic  to just do his stuff  be yourself and be real  when all of a sudden  you have to acknowledge  that a man just  changed his voice  and he's being  a different person  do I acknowledge 
[02:34:30]  you as the character  we all talk  in our real voices  here and this is  what you get used to  is fucking  interacting like this  so these fucking  hillbillies  that want fucking  a phony bitch  thrown at you  like you're  like you're  conversationally  just being funny  about planes  fucking douche bill  and they stunk  I stunk when I was  on their show too  and I'll never  be shy to tell you  I stunk  but the vibe  in that dump  was awful  so they fucking  said well we got  more listeners  than ONA  you know  cause we trashed them  and so the pests  are now showing them  you don't  motherfucker  oh the pests  lead them up  I know that much 
[02:35:00]  so fan  they're back  to attacking  Bill Burr  yeah they're back  to attacking  Bill Burr  and listen to  their two ingenious  ways of dealing  with the pests  alright  number one is  that they have  decided that  instead of taking  a lot of phone calls  today they are  playing pre-recorded  bits that that  guy with the  multiple voices  records with himself  you know what  let me tell you  something right there  before you go on  I love when the pests  make the shows  change their show  they force them 
[02:35:30]  to change their  game plan for the  day  we have not gotten  one  excuse me  we have not gotten  one Walton and  Johnson fan call  whatever the fuck  their names are  no  and not  our show has not  changed in Iota  no  and the fucking  and Bam and Doug  and these guys  change the nature  of the show  what else are you  saying sweet  sweet angel  the other thing is  they've had like  seven real callers  get through  and we've figured  it out that  six of them  are the same  person  oh again  isn't that great 
[02:36:00]  do you have all  this taped  yeah we need to  hear the audio  we have  we have everything  taped  ship some of the  uh ship some of  the successful  attacks over to  Steve  and also hear some  of this stuff  dude if you could  put those  hey Bam  if you guys could  put those seven  calls back to back  of their listeners  the different  listeners calling it  it would be funny  to hear the same  guy calling over  and over  yeah absolutely  and uh if anyone  wants updates on  stuff it's  myspace.com  forward slash  Opie and Anthony  Pest  that's the new  MySpace account  P-E-S-T-S  because a lot of

[02:38:30]  Opie  see  we had the clip  ready  yeah  basically  he called his ELO  and said that he had  a strip club  named Ramon  let's hear the call  we don't have it yet  right  we don't have it yet  okay  call back  Swami  oh man I'm sorry  nah don't be  I'm popping this guy's video  here he is  look at him  look at him on the phone  I'm looking at you  Swami Opie  you look like a dick  you look like  he looks like  fucking  he looks like E-Rock  he does look like E-Rock  holy shit  an E-Rock clone  you're e-stupid 
[02:39:00]  whether I should  fuck him or fight him  fuck him or fight him  best part of Raging Bull  is Tommy Cuomo  laughing  like it was the  fucking greatest thing  he's ever heard  fuck him or fight him  couldn't believe Jake  had just come out  with that gem  got his arm around him  with big thick glasses  he covers his mouth  he can't get over it  but Jake said something  with the lades at the table  guys we got a  we got a big time athlete  on the phone here  a big time athlete  Twitchels  who plays in a real sport  what does that mean 
[02:39:30]  the hell was that  of course we do  why would we have to play  wait a minute  John Daly  hey guys  John Daly on the phone  I hope you weren't  listening to that  that crap  we're a much better show  than what you just heard  for the last three or four minutes  I thought it was beautiful  yeah I'm sure you did  how are you John  I'm doing good  how you guys doing  good  John Daly of course  from the PGA  he's got a new book out  called My Life In and Out  of the Rough  the truth behind  all the bull  dot dot dot  bullshit  you think you know 
[02:40:00]  about me  wow  a lot of misconceptions  about you John  more facts  I mean  a lot of people  just didn't get facts right  about a lot of stuff  well you hear the sensational stuff  and that's the kind of things  that I guess interest people  and that's all they want to hear  or believe  is it different  I mean  well it's just  there's a lot of things  that people didn't know about  I mean  you know  well we heard about the gambling  the drinking  the you know  is that stuff true 
[02:40:30]  oh yeah  and I'm relieved  because I think  you're my hero  because  it's almost like  you don't give a shit  well I'm not really  I mean I do  but you know  some things I do  and some things I don't  we're all kind of  we're all kind of  the same aren't we  I mean some  some problems  affect more people  than it does us  you know  but  hell that book  is just there  it's just everything 
[02:41:00]  and it's the truth  and a lot of it's good  a lot of it's not so good  but you know  the fans deserve the truth  and that's kind of  what we did  when we did the book  right  what do you think  what did you think  of Phil Mickelson  just completely collapsing  this year  at the U.S. Open  wow  I mean it's just  you get all the way there  in your 72nd hole  and you know  you got it  and wow  it just  that's a tough one  to you know  did you ever have to  find your drive  in a garbage bag 
[02:41:30]  like he did  oh plenty of them  and not just  on the golf course  I found them  in garbage cans  and houses  that was amazing  it's the U.S. Open  Phil Mickelson  has it in the bag  and then he  hits his drive  in a bag  there was a great picture  the next day  of him bending over  into a garbage bag  looking for his drive  I mean it's one of the  most unbelievable  breakdowns ever  yeah I've never seen  and from Phil  I just never would think  he would do something  like that  well he was known  for being a choker  for a while there  and then he got 
[02:42:00]  his game together  he started winning majors  and you know  really turned the corner  and then out of nowhere  he has this  unbelievable collapse  this year  yeah the U.S. Open  he's had a chance  to win it a few times  and I mean  I don't know  what was going  through his head  if he  I know he was there  early  and he hit a lot  I guess he hit  driver there every day  and he must have  hit it good  but  one or two shot lead  and I'm not  such a very  a real long  18th hole  I was surprised  he  Bonesy just 
[02:42:30]  his caddy  just didn't say  hey let's just hit  a two or three iron  out there  and hit six or seven  iron into the green  because it  from what I heard  the pin was right  and if you  you could hit it  a little left  and it was funneled  down to the hole  so I  hell I don't know  I just wish I'd have  been there  in that situation  yeah  and you didn't play  the U.S. Open  this year huh  no I had gotten  out of the top 50  in the world ranking  and I didn't  I didn't get in  now you were  you were golfing  really before  golf really took 
[02:43:00]  off nationally  as a sport  that a lot of  people watch  I mean it was  pretty niche  as far as people  watching it on  TV  did you find it  intrusive  after you know  everyone knew  your name  and your business  and a lot more  press was after  you than it was  before it  really took off  yeah I mean  back in the early  I got my car  to 91  and was fortunate  to win the PGA  and it was a  blown up  you know  just the story  went nuts  and that's kind  of when golf  kind of turned 
[02:43:30]  you know  our TV contracts  were so much bigger  it was being shown  on more channels  and of course  the golf channel  has been a blessing  to everybody  I mean if you're  a true golf fan  that's where you  want to watch  you know  everything about golf  but there's so many  more channels  that were covering  golf  yeah so now  now you walk around  and everyone knows  who you are  not just  you know  people that are  into golf  I mean  even the casual  golfer  knows what you  look like  and you know 
[02:44:00]  some of the stories  the gossip  I think also too  because I think  you  John Daly  I mean  this guy's like  a maverick  in that world  you know  I mean  he's not the  prototypical golfer  with the polo shirt  nice and lean  and pretty  and bullshit phony  he's real  he's real  and I think  that's cool  smoking his cigarette  yeah I like that  he's just like  the crowd loves  John Daly  when he plays  I mean  because the shots  you attempt  people are like  oh my god  what was the tournament  was it last year  or a couple years back  you pretty much  had the tournament  won  your 18th hole 
[02:44:30]  all you have to do  is play conservatively  and you take out  like a three wood  and decide to pop it  over a pond  or something  you land in the back trap  remember the shot  I'm talking about  that was last year  in Houston  where I was playing  that was the  playoff against VJ  that's right  ok it was the playoff  and the announcers  were like  oh my god  he's pulling a three wood  what the hell is he doing  and the crowd  just went nuts  and you just  destroyed the ball  and you ended up  in the back trap  and now you gotta  put it close 
[02:45:00]  from the back trap  and you nailed it  I think you  oh yeah  that was San Diego  in 0-4  against Chris Riley  and Luke Donald  ok yeah  where I knocked  the sand shot  real close  and won  yeah like 3 or 4 feet  and then you won  the whole tournament  but what I'm trying  to say here  is the announcers  just you know  they should expect  it from you  at this point  but they didn't  they just lost  their minds  that you were  pulling a wood  out of your bag  and the crowd  was like  just  that's what people  want to see though  you know  absolutely  John I don't golf  a lot of my friends  are golfers  do you think 
[02:45:30]  that like  the face of golf  is changing  in people's eyes  like you guys  like you and Tiger Woods  like the way  people view golf  yeah  because everything  so  everything so  what do you call it  analyzed to a T  now  in golf  you know  it used to be  when you'd watch it  on TV  it was just about  a score  and how far  a guy hit it  and how good  he putted  and shit  but  you know  we got these  shot link things  now you point  to your ball  and it shoots  ok  you know  you got  62.1 yards  to the cup  it's going to break 
[02:46:00]  right to left  you know  whatever  I mean  it's just  everything's so  meticulous about the game  now  which I think  you know  just  you know  how they show  the green slopes  on TV  and stuff  I mean  that  people can  see it on TV  but people want  to see shots  they want to see  people swinging  and hitting golf balls  and I think  our coverage  has gotten  away from  you know  if you go to  Europe  and you watch  golf  they show  almost every shot  and they show  you know  50 to 60 guys  and our state 
[02:46:30]  only shows  on the weekends  only about  10 maybe  well I meant  the image  of golfers  like again  like you said  you're a male  you know  like appealing  to younger people  like whereas golf  was always considered  like ah  it's something  your dad's  going to do  yeah  but there's like  more interesting  characters playing  golf now  it seems like  people are  much younger  watching it  yeah well  they're staying  in shape  they're eating  right  yeah  like you  John  yeah  I'll be right  there in the gym  they don't let me  bring my smokes  or my beer  hey I bet  you've driven  by a few  gyms  right  drove by them 
[02:47:00]  and stuff  you can't smoke  on the course  I smoke on the  course yeah  oh good for you  I don't think  they're too happy  about that  but yeah  what are they  going to do  hey the new book  my life in and out  of the rough  I'm looking at  some of the chapters  and chapter 7  all my exes  wear Rolexes  oh nice  that's nice  I like that  oh boy  and I'm sure  that makes you  really happy  right John  oh yeah  how many times  I was married  and divorced  three times  and I'm on  my fourth wife  right now 
[02:47:30]  oh John  John  why  we always ask  why  because Anthony  went through  a pretty brutal  divorce  went through one  and it's just  never ever  going to happen  again  and every day  that he can  he yells and screams  that he'll never  do it again  and I can't  understand why  someone that went  through it once  would do it  again and again  you're on your  fourth  wow  well when kids  are involved  man  I mean  it makes it  tougher  you know  I've had it  with Betty  hey I date kids  too  but I'm not  going to marry  him 
[02:48:00]  well yeah  but I mean  the thing is  the thing people  forget is you  love that person  at one time  in your life  yeah you do  forget that  real quick  and I've never  left a divorce  or a relationship  hating anybody  really  no  let me tell you  a little story  about 40 G's  disappearing in  one day  out of my  bank account  that's when  that kind of  ticks you off  the way it works  but you know  it's  I feel for families  that go through  the same thing  I've gone through  the thing is 
[02:48:30]  what's most important  is just the child  and whether it's  the father or the mother  it just seems like  one of them seems  to take that away  from the child  and you just  can't do that  and that's what  pisses me off  about a lot of  the divorces  and you know  they forget about  the children  and you can't do that  you gotta have  the no kid divorce  those are the fun ones  where it's just  pure hatred  that's just violence  fuck you  fuck you  pure hatred  arguing over a stool  that's what you want  caught on film  talking to a police officer  about how to cut her  brake lines 
[02:49:00]  John you still do  some of that gambling  or what?  oh yeah  not as much  as I used to  but  and you still have  a few beers  here and there?  oh yeah  no doubt  I love this guy  yeah cause that  got you  I mean they said  that got you  in trouble  and I think  you were in the  program for a little  while and now  you're just like  I can do this  on my own  yeah the whiskey  got me in trouble  not the beer  not the beer  where's the whiskey  I'm a walking 
[02:49:30]  keg with legs  what's your poison  as far as  the gambling?  it's usually  blackjack  or high spots  yeah  how much you lose?  I've lost a lot  a lot  it's legendary  I've heard some stories  that the numbers for you  in one day  are just  I heard one time  you dropped like  1500 a day  yeah  could be a little more  than that  I wish it was that small  I'm not a big gambler  I've always been afraid  to gamble 
[02:50:00]  like I just don't  trust myself  so I pick up hookers  and I don't use a rubber  so I figure that's  some kind of a dice roll  that's gambling  definitely gambling  the ultimate gamble  have you lost a million  in one weekend?  oh yeah  no way  that's bullshit  for real honestly  oh is that rough  that's a rough loss  I lost 800,000  800,000 in one night  how do you leave the casino  without just driving  into an abutment  playing blackjack?  yeah  I just go to the next one  and try and get it back  to the next casino  when my markers run out 
[02:50:30]  that's called a problem  do you like  at what point  do you say  when you're losing  800,000  what point do you go  alright I just want to  get back to such and such  when do you start to panic  and go I'm down  a lot of money  the first like  100 bucks you lose  you're thinking  I gotta get it back  John Daly makes  I mean  not to get into your personal life  but he's gotta make  you know  he's gotta make  $150,000, $200,000 a year  oh easily  could be a couple  more bucks than that  perhaps more than that  Jim  perhaps  John when you lost  800,000 in one day 
[02:51:00]  how much was the last hand  worth?  that time I was playing  like 5,007 ways  wow  Christ almighty  I gotta get into golf  yeah  dude  but you know something  you can't buy  that kind of adrenaline rush  I wanna pull a train  with fucking John Daly  he's the greatest guy  I've ever talked to  in my life  I just wanna get  I'll pay for the girl  you on one  and me on the other  we just high five  and make eye contact  god that's a visual  shoot craps on our back  and then shoot crap 
[02:51:30]  on our back  how great is it  to hear somebody  fucking finally honest  yeah I know  everybody denies this stuff  this is why we like sports  yeah I don't understand  why they deny it  I mean it's  that's why I brought  the book out  a lot of you know  like a lot of the stuff  in there that you hear  media and news  clippings and stuff  it's all  just a lot of it's not factual  and the book is all  about the truth  and there's so many  good things in there  but there's you know  some rough spots  in there as well  I don't doubt it  your drives were 
[02:52:00]  you know  legendary  did that become distracting  that you had to live up  to you know  getting that ball  off the tee  and really  setting some records there  instead of playing  you know  some smart golf  I never really hit driver  unless I thought  I could pull it off  yeah  if I didn't pull it off  then I'd pull it  one iron or two iron out  back in those days  or whatever  because I know  everybody would talk  about how far  you can drive a ball  you know  yeah now  I'm only like top  I'm barely in the top 10 
[02:52:30]  in the driving stat  averaging like 308  or 309 or something  what was your furthest drive  uh  full  let's see  what was it  the LA airport  we did a Wilson ad  it was 806 yards  I don't play golf  that's far  that was on the runway  dude  it's like an eighth  football field  on the runway  well it bounced a few times  let's be fair  on pavement  it wasn't like  he hit it into a mud pit  Jesus Christ  I heard  did you  something that happened  to you in Augusta 
[02:53:00]  heard something about that  somebody heard a room  that you shit yourself  in Augusta  or something like that  I don't know  I'm telling you  I heard something like that  maybe it wasn't him  maybe it was somebody else  I'm not kidding  yeah he's gonna admit  to shitting his pants  no no no  well he said  he's honest  I'm going to deny it  I've shit my pants before  but now I'm a guy  I'm around the course  you bastard  I'm sorry to John  I didn't know that  you've all had  you know  a nugget pop out  every so often  when you're running home  believe me  I've turtled many times  but he's honest  he's just fessed up  especially when you're playing golf  out there  and it's 100 degrees 
[02:53:30]  oh my god  oh  nothing  and I'm sure  you know  if you've been drinking  you go in those stalls  you know  those little outlet things  those Johns they have out there  that smell so bad  when it's 110 degrees  oh yeah  I gotta put my golf glove  over my mouth  when I go in there  to take a dump  you're a big dude too  so you can't fit  in those little fucking huts  nothing better than  walking around  for the rest of the game  when you got like  cranky ass  after you just wipe  swamp ass  and it smells like  wet meanies  just trying to concentrate  and you're just getting 
[02:54:00]  the itch  hot meanies  who's the best golfer  you've ever played against  and that's kind of  like a layman's question  but I don't play golf  oh it'd have to be Tiger  it is okay  it's just phenomenal  I mean  he's ridiculous  yeah damn  although Vijay  he's up there  but he is so boring  to watch  he's like a robot  Vijay  but you know  if you get to know  these guys  they're funny  I mean Tiger and Vijay  are two of the funniest  guys I've ever met  on the floor  yeah but see John  they don't show  their true personality  in front of the camera  you do  see that's the difference  I mean that's why  you know what I mean  people dig him  he's a blue collar guy 
[02:54:30]  you know  you guys ever trash talk  each other when you're  walking up that fairway  oh yeah for fun  oh yeah Vijay  we and him  we're always at it  nothing you know  serious though  in a fun way  we're always at it  pushing shoving  like a  like a soccer match  do you ever headbutt  someone in the chest  that was tremendous  well we've never done that  but I mean Vijay  will say  why don't you practice  Christmas soup  because I don't need to  why don't you practice  alright that's talking  a little shit  hey let's go to Ted  in uh  it looks like South Dakota  Ted  hey I've uh 
[02:55:00]  heard John's name  is Long John Daly  wow  oh really  and they're not talking  about his drive  is that a rumor  as far as uh  John is a man  on the phone  there's a guy  who wants to know  about your cock  yeah  guy on the phone  says you got a huge cock  and it's legendary  in the clubhouse  yeah it's uh  it's it's  too big for the fat body  that I have  it's about like  it's the third person  thank you Travis 
[02:55:30]  for the call  you know you got girth  when that happens  it's interfered  with a few games  so John  where's your game at  are you gonna  what's the deal  you gonna be playing  on uh  the PGA Tour  some more  it's a driver  head cover on it  yeah  a little fucking  my lion  my head cover's a lion  it's not a lion  it's a lion  it's a lion  head cover  hold this caddy  going to the British  Sunday  I'll be in  overseas for a couple weeks  okay  yeah you're in the British Open  yeah  very cool  hey good thing  they don't drink much  over there  exactly

[03:00:00]  you were just about to hit it  and he's like  I saw him  he was lining up  I was like  what did he send you  I don't really care  what kind of troubles he sent you  and I was like  chocolate  I was just  I'm sorry  I was just setting up my own line  I didn't catch it  I wouldn't step on somebody  because I don't really get many setups here  on this show  I have noticed that by the way  I was going to say  did he send you chocolate  covered Cialis  so  nice  that was funny  it would have been funny  that timing and everything  but I was saying thank you  and it was a legitimate thing  Ope said that like 
[03:00:30]  what did he send you  I mean that wasn't  that doesn't sound like a setup  like I  you know  but bro  Ope was about to hit you with a line  I mean I  jeez I'm a novice  and I saw it  but I was  you don't understand  I'm a fucking novice  I'm self obsessed  I just didn't  I would never step on Ope's line  so self set  I finally had a line  I knew it was going to work  let me step on a character  this is Jim Norton  the character  that's what I do  when you do my characters  that's what I do  that's what I do  power of the mic  that's the man right there  speaking of doing  see what I do 
[03:01:00]  when you do that  I gotta  I gotta conserve my bits  I only have three  three maybe four  alright  I'm gonna have my yogurt  it's some blueberry  hey  that's how I say  blueberries  that I stole from my brother  let's keep it straight here  what's up with this  who thing  I don't even know  I heard  Kevin  Kevin's a big who fan  Kevin  went to the press conference  with big dreams  and just panicked  at the last second  didn't you  I heard you were a little nervous 
[03:01:30]  I was a little nervous  it's my favorite band  of all time  there's not even a close second  for me  I never knew that  it's true  who was it was a press conference  done via satellite right  via satellite  okay  where were they  they were in Berlin  did you say via  he just felt like  corrected me  I don't know  via via  I don't know  is it via  it works both ways  I say via  you say tomato  I say nice tits  tomato  that's my line  that's my line  I forgot to say  no is that  that really was  no Anthony bashed me on it  he did  the tomato line 
[03:02:00]  fucking Taz  this is hot chicken  he goes  hey look at the guy  look at the tomato  look at the tomato  in front of him  I was just  noticing how it was 1958  you mean the one  getting into the Edsel  that reference  that's tomato  when he said  excuse me colored gentleman  I thought it was  well yeah  he scolded that guy  for looking at the tomato  I could have had you  shut  alright so  what's the deal with this  what do we got on this  Ben  so  so Big Kev  we bring Big Kev  to the  to the Hoop Press Conference  the China Club 
[03:02:30]  because he's a huge  Hoop fan  figured he'd be fun  he was really excited  it's his favorite band  so we get there  of course Kev  goes and sits  in the front row  front and center  right in front of the thing  hell yeah  and you know  they came out  they played a new song  acoustic  they played  Won't Get Fooled Again  acoustic  now you're watching  this on a huge monitor  yeah and there's  a bunch of monitors  how was the new song  first of all  I liked it  come on  do we have it  yes we do have it  I'd like to hear  a little new who  first album  first  they haven't decided  whether they're gonna  keep it as an acoustic 
[03:03:00]  song  or whether they're gonna go  you're already over explaining  which means  that's a problem  you even know  it's not that good  which means it's not that good  but we're hoping  he's justifying it  definitely  first album in 27 years  is that what I'm hearing  yes  first new material  yeah  so 79  that's what I'm hearing  yeah I mean  well there was 82  there was Athena  that album  it's hard  but I mean  and they've had a couple  newer songs on compilations  but first full album  that's what I was gonna say  so that's not  but Poundstead's been  doing his own music  ever since then  but they put out  an album in the 80s 
[03:03:30]  it's hard  1982  oh okay  so what's in 82  24 years  24 then  oh okay  I'm gonna say 27  I'm talking on my ass  how about  it's just a technicality  I think  whatever  it's a long fucking time  yeah exactly  hey that covers it  they would have said that  on wins this morning  in a long fucking time  I'm John Montone  after Athena  they should have taken off  a quarter century  oh boy  it was bad  I know  but you didn't like Athena  Jim loves that song 
[03:04:00]  I had no idea  I don't know  but Eminence Front  was on  it's hard  now you know the one  Eminence Front  see that song  wasn't bad  it's a put on  put on  what is that  Eminence Front  come on  you know  you know all the hoops  Roger D playing  a little guitar  on that one  oh god  Eminence Front  uh oh 
[03:04:30]  Derek's panicking  he has no idea  how to spell it  cause we're going  through 30 songs  the second he gets  one up  we move on  to another song  hey spell Eminence  shit dick  that's the only reason  we haven't heard it yet  it doesn't start  with M  stupid  he's looking for  M dash  M dash  N dash  see to take it  inside the show  Derek is the one  that pops the music on  when we need it  from the other studio  and he can't spell  or not  he's looking for  Eminem's Front  Eminem's 
[03:05:00]  right  this is it  it starts with  this awful  Casio crap  now you gotta  remember what  year this was  anyone  I don't  I don't  you gotta  no it's like  early 80s  very early 80s  I remember this  on MTV  all the time  it's a cool song  it's when you  this song isn't bad  when it gets in  it starts rocking  it's not bad  it's atrocious  no listen when it rocks  it's when the  who were doing  promotions for MTV  we want our MTV 
[03:05:30]  I want my MTV  play some of this  it was the song  they played  when they could all  just move together  on the stage  listen to that  come on  that's a cool  little riff  there Jimmy  wait  yeah it's good  that is cool  cool riff  alright that is a good riff  well let's hear  your riff  that's a good  I'm saying  it's a good  I want to hear  a Jim Norton riff  someone should have  sampled this for  no that's theirs  it's mine  do your own riff  I don't have a riff 
[03:06:00]  I don't have a riff  I'll go to get one  I never knew the name  of the song  Eminence  what does that mean  Eminence  what the fuck  that's exactly it  there's songs  there's titles  I don't know  what the fuck  they're talking about  either  I'm a Led Zeppelin  D.C.D.C. guy  Black Sabbath  yeah  Mike Won't Get Fooled Again  that confusing title  yeah  let's get into this  so what happened Ben  so they did  they did the new song  they came out  they played an acoustic  oh you want to hear  the new song  a little bit  he plays the same song  he's old  he's old 
[03:06:30]  he's old  that's the explanation  he's old  he's old  he's old  he's old  he's old  he's old  everything is alright 
[03:07:00]  we play today  everything is okay  we play today  we play today  I love the whole  I love the whole  this stage  I should have wrote a song  about Pete's computer  they don't have any hair yet 
[03:07:30]  that's terrible  I'm sorry  that's terrible  I'm sorry  that's terrible  I'm sorry  that's terrible  let's see  that we should get  day to day  come watch those songs  that make men cry  the young lords  the version of  Won't Get Fooled Again  is pretty good  I'll go home  and get your fucking shine  does it get better Kevin?  this song?  I'm actually calling you Kevin  yes  don't come out of character  it's kind of um 
[03:08:00]  yeah like boring  it sucks  this name of the song  should be  we ran out of money  so we're doing this song  fuck  that's actually alright  with all the commercial  stuff that they're doing  he's definitely not  out of money  I don't get to  the dance of Kevin  I'm just trying to say  it sucks  it sucks bro  Pete Townsend gets  Pete Townsend keeps  getting talked into it  he doesn't  I mean if you read  anything about the Who  he has no desire  to do the Who thing anymore  that's not true  and Roger Daltteri  like works him for years 
[03:08:30]  and then they finally  get back together  that song should be  that song should be  we won't get on the charts again  none of them  I read it  I think it was  the Rolling Stone interview  or something  where Pete Townsend was like  I'm done with this part  of my life  but I keep being  forced back into it  we hope you get fooled again  they didn't mention  any of that  Townsend said  he was the one  that he wanted  yeah  alright well then  this time it's different  I know someone out there  will back me up  it was an article  and Pete Townsend  was very honest  he's like  I'm done  Pete talked about  Pete talked about  his career 
[03:09:00]  and whether he should  play now  play more  do more touring  and this was his answer  no  my head doesn't allow  all right  so  I don't touch them  I just look at them  they're so cute  when they're that young  easy colonel  colonel Townsend  so  alright  so then what  happened there  so then they  performed  the young boy's bellies  then they played  Won't Get Fooled Again  then they played  Won't Get Fooled Again  which was great 
[03:09:30]  that sounded great  did it  what's with his fucking voice  he said that they had  performed last night  in where was it  somewhere in Germany  somewhere in Germany  where it was a  really bad venue  Auschwitz  where the hell  they performed  actually they made a joke  about that  hey why not  enough time has gone by  why not  they were on the  Allied side  that was it  so that was the excuse  yeah it was  worst excuse ever  because he played  the night before  didn't the press conference  go worldwide  it was just  Berlin 
[03:10:00]  just Berlin and New York  but that's a big deal  you would think  you would rest your voice  before a press conference  he actually started  when they started  that new song  he started and restarted  yeah he restarted it  because it was really well  he plays  I think it's going to have  to do what a  Stephen Yellowstone calls  and imagine if he's singing  yeah how tired  is Townsend of Death  yeah I know  how tired  is Townsend of Death  not at all  and he still plays  the guitar like  he's punishing it  oh he's punishing  the listeners  fuck  here we go  bye 
[03:10:30]  oh yeah I know  Jesus  time to change  smile  smile  smile  they sit in judgment  all on  I know  did a sign  and shotgun  sings a song  to the new constitution  take a fight  for the new revolution 
[03:11:00]  smiling green  change all around  me got my guitar  and I play  Just like yesterday  It's uncomfortable to listen to it, it's horrible  Why are we listening to that?  I think I'm going to give him this after the doubt  He sang the night before  He might have just blown his voice out the night before  We don't get fooled again  Hey, look, you're Roger Dolph  You don't blow your voice out  This guy's a legendary guy, though  These guys are older, man  They played a three-hour show of who's songs the night before  I think it's okay that he's a little raw than his death 
[03:11:30]  Yeah  That was Kevin's death  Not when the whole, I still say the whole world is, you know, listening in on this  But he is Roger Dolph  I mean, he's pretty much a book  No one has heard Roger Dolph in a few years  This is our first impression after a few years  You rest your voice and make sure you're  Go away on top  Go away on top  Make sure you're in tip-top shape where the voice is  Three years?  Not even  I'm not going to argue with you, dude  Wait, wait, wait  The reality is if I took a poll right now 
[03:12:00]  I guarantee I would get people saying, I haven't heard Roger Dolph in ten years  This is like, this is like a debate about the episode  They're going to sing next, won't get sick again  Oh, the album, who's dead?  Oh, wow, Robert Reed, rib xylophone 
[03:12:30]  All right, what else we got here?  I love that old gag  So then they, you know, and then  Oh, that's good shit  You know, and then they, you know, they tossed it to New York  All the questions were done out of New York  So you had everyone from, you know, David Frick to Big Kev there  Hey, and everyone in between  Yeah  And what happened with Big Kev?  We got the audio, but what happened?  Yeah, Kev got up to  Yeah, why would the mic work for the mic?  The mic just went out  Sam, look at Sam  It's not perky or jerky proof  Kev, Kev, Kev was like trying to figure out what to ask over and over again 
[03:13:00]  And, you know, he had a question  I had a really good one set up  He got nervous, he got nervous and started stuttering  And as he asked it, Townsend's face was hilarious  He's like, what the fuck is it?  Yes, he was  Sam will back about what I said in the beginning  But he still looked at you and he says, I'll have Roger answer that  Right  He was annoyed  Absolutely, Sam  You annoyed your hero  It's because he was stuttering and muttering his whole way through the question 
[03:13:30]  And they were just sitting there  And the band was sitting there like, what?  Because they just heard serious press conference  You know, real questions from real news outlets  And this guy  And he obviously was  He had the question in his mind  But he wasn't sure if and how he was going to ask it  Oh, boy  That's not good  Dude, I'm annoyed my idols  I had a great question  I had a great question to ask  And I was going to ask if it was  If there was any truth to the rumor that they were going to actually name the album  Who's Left  Oh, boy  Right before that, they had just said how devastated they were 
[03:14:00]  That John Entwistle had died when they were  That's what makes it better  The band member dies  And you insult me  What the hell is the matter with you anyway?  You just mind your P's and Q's, Buster  And remember who you're dealing with  Pete Townsend  I switched it up in the middle  And I got nervous  Pardon my French  But you're an asshole  Who's Left  Is a real question you're going to ask?  Or is it a joke?  No, that was the question I was going to ask  Oh, there's rumors about that  There was actually  Oh, there's really rumors  Who's Left  Yeah  That is the most tasteless, awful 
[03:14:30]  That would never happen  Why would you ask them that?  It's just trite  Tommy from Brooklyn  He tasks me  Tommy  Hey, good morning, guys  Hey  Hey  If they blew out their voice the night before  If he blew out his voice  How's he going to do every night?  Maybe he'll work every other night  They're not playing every night  Yes, sir  Well, I just got it online  That they're playing The Garden  They're playing a few shows  Did you check the dates, doofus?  Hey, hey, hey  Hey, this is XM Satellite 
[03:15:00]  But we do have lines  Tommy, I'm with you  Obviously something is wrong with the guy's voice  It's gotten old or something  It's 63  Absolutely  Oh, that's great  All right, then lower the ticket prices  It'd be 63  How much is that?  How much is that?  How about them apples?  Oh, boy  Oh, way to fight for the little guy  Because I bet those tickets are a pretty penny  Singing for the Who  Yeah  Tara Reade  Oh, we hit bits together  That's why I stopped this game  Wow, when bits collide  I'm sorry 
[03:15:30]  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  We have a pile up  There's a Tara Reade  And a frowning Frank  Oh, no  I'm sorry, Tara  I didn't mean to interrupt  Bit traffic control  Bit traffic control  We have a Tara Reade bit  Bring it down to 4,000  And, um  All right, Frank the Frowner  You keep up at 4,000  Did I say four for both?  Yeah  Oh, no  There's been a collision  Oh, no  Humanity 
[03:16:00]  The humor  The humor  Do you know what I'm taking  Where Russell's to frown?  Let me tell you something  I just want to say  I sing for you now  I don't know why  I'm talking all over town  It's just talking over me  Change out of cum  Gonna do it all along  I'm gonna sing a song  Tommy, can you hear me?  Tommy, can you?  Tommy, can you?  I guess not  I would always go to locations  And then not do what I was supposed to  Because my voice was raspy  I'll incorporate it all if I have to  Hey, guys 
[03:16:30]  Let's collide  I gotta break in  Bruce Kelly's on the phone  Bruce  I'm not really kind  I'm not really kind  I'm like a little boy  Oh, Bruce  Bruce Kelly, everyone  All right, so  So when did you realize  You were panicking?  In the middle  In the middle  You were like, oh, God  Just get me to the end of this question  I wanted to make it interesting  For this show 
[03:17:00]  Because I knew that  They were gonna tape it  So I did something  In the beginning of the question  That I thought would make it interesting  Oh, no  All right  Good choice  Again, I panicked on my question  All right, here we go  It's Big Kev  Uh-oh  What are you doing?  Hold on  I gotta get into  I wanna get into a crash position  Is it good, Sam?  What I like is  Oh, man  I know this is just gonna be painful  As he's asking the question  You can plainly hear that  He's thinking about  Asking the who's left question  Oh, no 
[03:17:30]  And as he gets closer to the end  He's thinking  Am I gonna work it in?  And then we see what happens  Oh, no  So it's very obvious  Where he's going?  I think so  All right, I'm not gonna look  All right  At anybody during this  I can't  He's talking to his  Lifelong idols  Should Big Kev just turn around  So we don't have eye contact?  I won't look  Kev's proud of this moment  I'm totally prepared  To be trash  There we go  Hi, guys  I'm Big Kev from the O&A show  What a dick  And I just wanted to ask a question 
[03:18:00]  I collaborated with my friend  Jim Norton  Who's like the biggest  Who fan that I know  Oh, my  And we were curious to know  You've always had a sense of whimsy  About naming your albums  And currently  The new album is tentatively titled  To Who or Who Too  And we wanted to know  What's the process  For naming this sort of album  I mean, we've heard rumors  Of things like  All kinds of crazy names  And we wanted to know  Why you were settling on this one  Oh, God 
[03:18:30]  Okay  Wow  All right  We'll see you all Monday  Holy shit  I was nervous  Thank you for the mention  What a good boy  He gets the O&A name out there  And Jim Norton  Yeah, how do you not love Big Kev  Back goes Griffey  Looking up  And it's out of here  Why is it  No, it's off the wall  My mistake  Yeah  Mistake  That does 
[03:19:00]  It actually  Wouldn't have been bad  But it was funny  That tentatively has to be pronounced  You know, because  Telling  I mean, that's acceptable too  But Jimmy  Some of your comments  Are just full of whimsy  Yeah  I don't mean to be whimsical  Whimsy  Whimsy  As soon as he said that  Big Kev knew  That when you heard the audio  You would destroy him  For using the word whimsy  Of course, yeah  Yeah  It's whimsy  Oh wait, that's wimpy  Whimsy 
[03:19:30]  Whimsy  And the fact that you said  Why you settled on that name  Almost like this douchey name  Yeah, yeah, yeah  The title stinks  Yeah, nothing else  So you got your old fuckers  Went with this  That's what it was like  Well, are you ready for the response?  Okay  No  We haven't settled  Roger, you talk to him  Roger, you talk to this wanker  Talk to this fucking idiot  Fucking wanker  Like half a second  Oh, no  Roger  Deal with this fucking wanker  He doesn't let Roger talk  Ever for more than like 
[03:20:00]  Forty seconds  Before I should  He tells him to talk  He's the real brain of the man  We haven't settled  Not that you insulted him  Yeah  That was an insult  At the end he says that  He's going to consider what I said  And he's going to think about  The name of the album  Oh, really?  Because of Big Cav  Play it  We haven't settled  Don't look at my hard drive  The process is  It's Pete's turn to choose a name  Oh, funny  Oh, dear  Oh, dear  Yeah  Well, I think the last album 
[03:20:30]  Which was a catalogue album  That included a couple of new tracks  Wow  Doug Morris came up with that idea  The head of Universal  He said  Pete, I think we're going to call it  Then and Now  And I thought  Hmm, yeah, okay  You know  You're the head of Universal  You can have that one  But I think  If it's my turn  Then maybe I'll think about it  More seriously then  I think it's difficult  To think of this  By committee  So the idea  I was the one that came up  With the working title  Of Who Too  Which was a bit of a  You know  Obviously a sarcastic dig 
[03:21:00]  At my friends  In the famous  Irish rock and roll band  That have a similar name  And  But  It's also because  There are just two of us  But I'll think about it  More seriously  You know  The idea that the name is Whimsy  It comes simply  The title is Whimsy  Simply because  With a band called The Who  It's almost  It's almost  Impossible to resist  The temptation  Of coming up with a gag  You know  Who the fuck are you  Kind of thing  Oh my god 
[03:21:30]  Wow  He showed you  That was  I thought  Just that  They want to name it  Who Too  So people  You know  They might get confused  And think they're picking up  You too album  Right  If you just said  What's your process  And what finally made you go  Okay this is the one  We're going to go with  He probably would have been  Like happy to tell you  But it was an insult  Why did you settle  The way you nervous Nelly  The way you were  That you're like  Well you know  There's obviously  No thought put into it  It's all whimsical  And what made you finally  You know  Throw this dog shit out of  Go  The best thing is

[03:27:30]  I just authorized  To open up some more tickets  At 10 for all those people  Who were waiting  Until 10 a.m. to buy them  My guess is  They'll probably be gone  Within an hour or so  Wait we went through 1,000?

We'll be over 8,000 today  Nice  And we're still  You know  Obviously we're still  Six weeks away  There's really no advertising  Although I did hear though  If anyone's got verification  That the New Jersey 
[03:28:00]  Turnpike billboard went up  Ah  Maybe we did  Oh yeah  We've heard about that  Let's get a picture of that  We'll throw it on the  The old website  I'll get you one  And what about Boston?

[03:29:30]  And Jimmy's always there  He loves getting up here early  So he can pee  Right  And Sam's there with the camera  Right  And there were a couple of people  In the elevator  And Jimmy likes to bring out  Frank the Frowner  I didn't realize I was staying  That close to the guy  I honestly did not  And he backed into the elevator  And  A guy got annoyed  Backed right up  Where Jimmy's ass  Was rubbing on this guy's cock  In the elevator  What did you see Sam?  And he stayed there  Well I was looking at the guy  The whole time  And before he even started 
[03:30:00]  Doing the voice  The guy was glaring  At the bank of Jimmy's head  He was annoyed at Jimmy  So annoyed that Jimmy  Was that close  I had no idea  I really did not realize  It was great  If he would have just said  Excuse me sir  I would have went  Oh okay  I honestly didn't notice  Cause usually you get onto  An elevator already  Patched into the back  It's just the way it is  Yeah  I didn't know what it was  A bunch of men packing  I didn't realize  How about Sam  Getting a lot of air time today  Huh?  I don't like him  Sam  Sam's just waiting  For someone to quit  And he's in  Or die or get fired  Who do you think's gonna quit?  Who's gonna open up 
[03:30:30]  Your spot  Oh I'm quitting now  If you don't name a name  Then you know  I'll be  Travis is probably  Looking the least healthy  Wow  He really is  Yeah Sam is a good boy  As Jimmy would say  He's working every day  For free for us  Jesus  Doing a lot of  Really good stuff  But you know  One of these guys  Has to quit or move on  And then we get to hire him  Or else just stop paying  All of them  So Sam doesn't feel bad  Hey that's not a good idea  That's not a good  Alright  That's pretty good  It's like the old hoes  One of them has to finally go  Before you bring the new meat in 
[03:31:00]  Exactly  Mark in Houston  Yeah y'all are killing that show  And also I saw Bill Burr  At the improv  And he killed  Of course he did  There were a lot of pests there  And I mean he just killed  Bill Burr's hysterical  He is a very funny dude  What are Walton and Johnson doing  That they're getting killed  By the pests  They're just mainly playing  These stupid awful recorded songs  From  They're like these awful  Just charity songs  We heard a few  Yesterday 
[03:31:30]  Yep  They're horrid  Hey Chuck  The day of the song parody  Thank you sir  They're cornballs  The day of the fucking song parody  In radio  Is really over  It has to be  Really good  Or  And very few and far between  And it has to be like  A special occasion  Kind of thing  We'll play one every once in a while  Every once in a while  As far as  As far as like  Every event  Because remember  The days of radio  Where everything that happened  There would be a fucking  You know  Gaza strip parody 
[03:32:00]  That would be on  Every radio show  Right  There was services  That would  Just put out song parodies  And  Stations all over the country  Would subscribe to the service  And  Parodies would fly out  At all of them  And they'd play them every day  And all these morning shows  Would play like  They came up with it  Yeah  What a crime that shit  And it all came from a service  We tried to give people credit  Every single moment  On this show  We don't want to give you  Too much credit  Then it'll prove that  We actually don't do  Anything ourselves  Not a thing  Not a thing 
[03:32:30]  Alright Sam  So it was  It was a good video  And here's the audio  Let's listen in  Where's that music coming from  Is that from the elevator  One person gets left  One gets on  Alright  Well  Excuse me  You're standing like  Directly on my junk  Did you give me an inch  Oh I'm sorry sir  I didn't realize  I was on your junk  I apologize  You should have pressed it 
[03:33:00]  Against my supple backside  And that's when we walked  Off the elevator  That wasn't one of our guys  No  No  No  Some fucking fat  Cranky douche  And he had his iPod  Up real loud  He had his iPod  Up real loud  So you could hear it  Bleeding through  His ear buds  Yeah  And that's when Jimmy said  You know  Where's that music  Coming from  And then we stopped  At a floor  Girl gets on  Girl gets off  Jimmy's got a comment  And that's when the guy  Figured it was his time

[03:40:30]  Tom  You're straight  When Howard Stern  Started talking shit about you  When he first went to serious  You were like  Oh we're going to call this show  And we're going to make him stop  He just fucking ignored you  Tom  Tom  Tom  The truth of the matter is  The truth of the matter is  That the calls are so screened over there  That it's very hard to get on the air  And then they dump  Hey Tom let him finish  Hey Tom let him finish  And then they dump out of the callers  That are against his show  And the pests  And you never hear them on the air 
[03:41:00]  Doesn't mean they didn't get through  Doesn't mean it doesn't bug the shit out of him  And the screeners  That the pests are getting through  He doesn't talk about us  Because we're a threat  That's what happens  Now what Tom  Or maybe he's just fucking ignoring you  Like you're fucking crazy broad  Why would you ignore that  Also Tom  How come he didn't ignore us  When we were off the air  He talked about us a lot  Then when we got back on the air  And could defend ourselves  Then he really didn't talk about us too much  He still did  But why would he do that  And he's still talking about us 
[03:41:30]  He just hasn't done a live radio show  In two to three weeks  Maybe if he was on live  He would actually say something  So Tom  Answer Anthony's question  Why is that  Why when we were off the air  When we got fired  Did he talk about us a lot  And then right when we get back on the air  He shuts up  Unless he was threatened  Because maybe he's trying to piss you off  That's your answer dude  That would piss us off  We're doing a great show  A lot of people are listening to it  Apparently he did piss you off  We have more listeners than he does  What's your point  Tom how does it feel you have a bigger audience  Than Howard Stern

[03:49:00]  People think when a person  Gets old  Ready to die  Hell I don't think  It makes any difference  Whether you're five years old  Or you want to live  Eat breathe  And have fun  For Jim Ariotis  Baseball serves  As a fountain of youth  I've been doing this  I've been doing this  Since age 66  And I had played professionally  In the late 40's  I just do it  To stay in shape  And challenge myself  And it's something  That I enjoy doing  After countless trips  To the cage  Ariotis decided 
[03:49:30]  It was time for a taste  Of the real thing  Enter the Canaries  In the world  Of minor league baseball  It's a game of promotions  That's what independent baseball  Is all about  And if you can't  Go with the flow of that  You're probably going to have a hard time  You know succeeding  And surviving  In this method of the game  He's a publicity stunt  Yeah poor guy  But I like him though  He's very lucid  He's got gumption  You gotta like him though  He's just like  Yeah I just do it  To challenge myself  I like him  Yeah hard to goof on him  Yeah what's it say  He's fucking 83  And you know  He's alright 
[03:50:00]  Hopefully he won't make it to 84  Here's his bigot bat  Tuesday this promotion  Would come to life  As the 83 year old  Would surpass  Mini Minoso  And become the oldest person  Ever to play  Professional bass  I noticed unfortunately  That they walked him  And he's only up once  So I keep telling people  When I come out here  If they throw the ball  40 feet in the air  I'm not gonna walk  I'm gonna throw the bat up there  I'm gonna swing  It's a promise he would keep 
[03:50:30]  And while Ariotis  Did make contact  He simply couldn't catch up  With the speed of America's  Favorite pass time  The biggest difference  In professional baseball  Today is that  The kids are bigger  And stronger  And they hum the ball  Real good  Back goes Griffey  Looking up  And it's out of here  Or is it  No it's off the wall  My mistake  Oops  A back to back  And a belly to cast it

[03:52:30]  A good director  Or is he annoying  Because he's in the movie  No he's great  Yeah  Well I don't know  You just  It's not often  You look at a guy  That's going home  To Christopher Pillington  Oh really  You're going home  To Nicky Cox  Yeah  Oh believe me  I know that  These two just like  Laugh  On the way to the bank  The guy's acting  And the whole time  He's acting  You're saying to yourself  Don't forget to say cut  Don't forget to say cut  Don't forget to say cut  And then I wonder  If he's sitting there  Going  Don't forget to say cut  Don't forget to say cut  But then he acts 
[03:53:00]  And he says cut  He does both  At the same time  I don't know  When you sleep  But he's good in this  Like he's a good actor  In this  And Matthew Willard  Kind of  Steals the movie  A little too  I mean I'll be honest  With you  I steal the fucking movie  Let's call it  You're the guy right  Anthony  I fucking destroy  You are the guy  In this movie  Yeah groomsmen  I was thinking  Of going to see  Little man  But I think  I gotta see  Groomsmen  Little man  I got a tough choice  This weekend 
[03:53:30]  Should I see  A Jay Moore movie  Yeah Jay  Did they put your head  On a midget body  For this movie  Because that's the only way  It's really gonna be successful  Do I support  The Wayans brothers  Or my friend Jay  I'm joking  I wouldn't see  I'm not even renting  Little man  If someone is showing it  At their house  I'm not even gonna sit  And watch it  I think the Wayans brothers  Has put the black race  Back 50 years  Well did you see  The fucking movie poster  It looks like 
[03:54:00]  A Curious George book cover  Oh shit  Did you see  Lebanon called for a ceasefire  Yeah I saw that  Did they really  Pussies can't take it  Little too late  That's what you get  For fucking stealing soldiers  For no reason  Try to get your nose  In the whole mix  And do you know something  Do you think  They would be calling  For a ceasefire  If Israel would have  First  Maybe put some sanctions 
[03:54:30]  On them  And then gone to the UN  And maybe chit chatted  With Germany and France  To see if it was okay  If they laid some bombs  In there  And then  Do you think  Lebanon would have  Been calling for  Hey stop  Knock it off  No they go in there  And bomb the living fuck  Out of everything  The airport  What more fun place  Could you think of  To blow up  Than an airport  There's so many fun things  To bomb there  Just costing them  So much money  The amount of money  That's going to cost  Lebanon  And they're broke  For no reason  They had nothing 
[03:55:00]  To do with this  They support  Hezbollah  It's like if you're Israel  If you're Israel  Don't just say to yourself  Don't these camel fuckers  Remember the last  18 times they tried this  Yeah they get beat  Every time  Because they have no money  But you know what it is  They got beat  When they did it  With three other countries  They got beat  It was  What  Egypt  Syria  Syria  Syria and Lebanon  And it lasted  Six fucking days  Because dude  They look at America  And they forget  That Israel  They kind of look like 
[03:55:30]  Americans  But they're not the same  Fucking  Yeah  Pussies that we are  And if you hit them  They smash you  Because like us  You hit us  It's going to take  A long time  We got to debate things  There's going to be  So many people  Against it  And this  And the polls  Got to come out  And the politicians  Got to pay attention  To that  You get in your planes  You fly over  And you bomb  The living shit  Out of the place  That's how it works  And now look  Could you please stop  Now what's Israel  Saying about the ceasefire  Go fuck yourself  Is what they're saying  No they act like 
[03:56:00]  They didn't even get  The message  They act like  Oh you know what  I left my phone  In my car  I didn't even get that  They're pissed  That there's a phone  Left in Lebanon  For them to call  For a ceasefire  Yeah they want a pigeon  To deliver the next message  Yeah  You send a Roman  On foot  Hey give back  The soldiers  And we'll stop  That's what they should say  Why am I doing  An impression  Of how the Israelis  Will talk  Yeah  Oi  Give back  The soldiers  Jimmy  Yes sir  Congratulations 
[03:56:30]  I'm lucky Louie  Oh thank you  Thank you man  Yes  Thank you sweet  I like  I mean it's not like  The funniest  It's not the funniest line  People would pick  But just knowing you  My favorite is  When he goes  What's he doing to her  And you go  He's destroying her  You know it's funny  I didn't even write that line  That was what  That was  There's a lot of my lines  They let get through  On Louie  They really do  Louie as a stand up  Is so good with  Trying different things  But he's destroying her  Is actually one that they wrote  And it worked better  Than I thought it would  But this should have  Let you keep 
[03:57:00]  I gotta go  I gotta suck this  I know  But again  Louie's integrity  He said you felt like  You missed something  When you saw it  Even though it was  A massive laugh  But maybe they'll show  That in the DVD extra  Oh  I'm hoping so  Yes  I'm squeezing my tongue  Have you guys been watching  Torgasm  No I've not  I saw the first one  And that was it  I watched it with  Bob Kelly  Okay I need you to  Watch it again  And make believe  It's a Christopher Guest movie  Holy shit 
[03:57:30]  I don't get it  That's good  Brilliant  What's that mean?  Like Spinal Tap  Or Best in Show  Okay  Waiting for Guffman  J. Davis goes  You know what  That joke didn't work  And Dane goes  Because you gave up on it  You gave up on it dude  You gave up on it  You can't play the fucking guitar anymore  No  The joke sucked  I had an altoid  Right before I went on stage  And I had to swallow it  Really fast  And then the whole time  I was trying that joke  My throat was chalky  Yeah he didn't even want to acknowledge  That the material just blew 
[03:58:00]  Oh my god  You gotta imagine  Like Christopher Guest  That's really good  Like Parker Posey  And Fred Willard  Are in it  Yeah  Bob Kelly's becoming a star  Because of that show though  He's doing great  Wow he's fat  Yeah  Bob really  He really fucking  Should have a clock  In his stomach  Makes me  Physically ill  He's losing weight though  Is he?

He'd know you  They say he  Bench presses 400 pounds  That's impossible  I think it's almost impossible too 
[03:59:30]  But that's what they're saying  Hey  Why did you say hi to him?  He is  He is intimidating  I had my kid  And I had my sister  And my niece  I had my own thing going on  He would know him  Did he have people all over him?  He should have said hi to Jay Moore  How about that Jimmy?  He  We had like a whole discussion  We had our own like discussion going  Who's going on Tower of Terror?  We can't bring the kids  Bring them to the Georgia of the Jungle  But it took a hundred bucks  To get into Disneyland, right?  Yeah  I think it should be $800 
[04:00:00]  And that way  I don't have to stand behind  The fat Mexican lady  Hitting her kid over the head  With a flip-flop  Yep  Raise the price  Rich white people only  Attaboy, Jay  Fat  They're like 800 pound fat people  Where they like rest their arms  On their pussies  When they're sitting down  Where were you?

[04:00:30]  And a lot of English  In Florida  And they're fine to deal with  My kid had a growth spurt  He took like  We went to Hawaii  And he took like five shits a day  And he just kept eating  Like everything in the world  And then  He goes  Daddy, I'm done  I think though  Kids are potty trained  Before  They give themselves credit for it  Just because  They realize  That they have to make you  Like you have to wipe their ass  And that's the way  Like getting back at you  For spankings  You got to wipe shit 
[04:01:00]  Well, yeah  He's not like a grown  Retarded person  He's three years old  Yeah, Anthony can't even imagine  I can't even fathom  Having to do that  Imagine that  To a kid  Like he's talking to like  His, you know  Stuffed animals  Like  You know this nigga  Spanked me yesterday  Check this out  Daddy, I'm done  I'm done  Wipe my ass  I got a full one  I'm done  So I go to  White Pizzets in Hawaii  And I wipe his ass  And a log rolled out  Past my hand  And I jumped back  Like it was a mouse

You know, I don't know  It could exist  But, I mean  It's Tom Cruise  Like, they got more money  Than anything  They got like 17,000 acres  And they probably got like  A series of tunnels  Like Maxwell Smart  They can walk through  That kid's probably got a 
[04:02:30]  Fucking job at Starbucks  For the last two months  Who don't even know it  I'll bet you that they're just  Keeping him in a quiet atmosphere  For like 90 days or six months  Because they think it's going to be  Help them develop better  I bet you that's all it is  It's complete  And part of me likes the fact  That they don't want the fucking  Dirty media getting pictures  Of their kids  Um, for like, for what?  Why should the media have pictures?  Why should people see us?  No one's fucking busy with that  What's the quiet atmosphere?  The audience when Jay Davis is on  Oh, I'm with you, buddy  Oh, shit  I'm so with you  You know, Jay 
[04:03:00]  That was just mean-spirited  Yes, sir  I read on the Black Bag  Somebody goes  Why do they keep going  Rachel, give him back  And I don't like it  Somebody wrote  I don't know what it is  And I don't like it  I wish they would stop  No, do you?
