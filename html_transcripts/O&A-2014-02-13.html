<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony pre-show, hosted by Sam Roberts on a Thursday before Valentine's Day 2014, heavily featured the New York City blizzard, mocking the over-the-top news coverage.  Opie expressed significant disdain for the repetitive reporting.  The show then dissected AskMen.com's "99 Most Desirable Women" list, with Opie and Anthony frequently dismissing women with derogatory terms, while Jim Norton enthusiastically approved of all.  An awkward moment ensued when Chelsea Peretti, a friend of Opie's wife and Jim's ex-girlfriend, appeared on the list.  Jim also made sexually suggestive comments about Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo!.  The pre-show included awkward listener calls, one featuring a racist joke from Chris in Rochester hampered by technical difficulties.  Another caller recounted an encounter with an Opie and Anthony fan on Scott Shannon's show.  Derek Jeter's retirement announcement was briefly discussed, overshadowed by the blizzard coverage.  Other topics included Opie's NutriBullet smoothie, a caller's drunk driving across multiple states, a viral video of a Texas sportscaster reporting on Michael Sam, the Florida shooting of a black teenager, and the deaths of Sid Caesar and Moms Mabley.  The pre-show also featured several viral videos: a police chase on GoPro and individuals scaling a skyscraper without safety equipment. The pre-show concluded with anticipation for the main show.

The main show continued with more viral videos depicting extreme stunts, including acrobatic feats on high-rise I-beams, base jumping, Felix Baumgartner's jump, and people hanging off moving trains in India. A caller shared a story about pursuing what he thought was a stolen bus.  The hosts discussed the deaths of Chuck Yeager and Sid Caesar, also mentioning Jerry Springer's age. A significant portion focused on a Nicki Minaj song containing a racial slur, prompting a debate about the word's usage in music.  The show also touched upon one host needing a tonsillectomy and featured several sponsor advertisements.

A chaotic segment followed, discussing the lyrical content of Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross songs, including sexually suggestive and violent themes, and radio edits of these songs.  The hosts debated Macklemore's Grammy apology, deemed insincere by Drake and the hosts. A video of 2 Chainz, described as absurd and containing violent and sexually suggestive imagery, sparked a debate about its impact on children.  The conversation shifted to a news story about a bus driver fired for fighting back against a student.  The hosts gave their opinions on various rappers (Pitbull, 2 Chainz),  then returned to Derek Jeter's retirement.  This segment included listener calls and numerous commercial breaks for various products including Gamefly, What's Your Price, Progressive Insurance, Vermont Teddy Bear Company, ProFlowers, Steven Singer Jewelers, weight loss supplements, a male enhancement product, and Pajamagram. A retro, awkward interview with Cindy Williams ("Laverne & Shirley") in a "Has Been Corner" segment was featured.  The hosts used highly offensive language and racial slurs throughout.


The next segment began with a discussion on the effects of pineapple on semen, including a humorous anecdote about one host filming himself ejaculating.  The conversation shifted to high demand for Derek Jeter's last game tickets on StubHub, Ray Nagin's arrest, and a nonsensical tangent about a "Tire Day" at Yankee Stadium.  A Seinfeld bit and a brief encounter with Jerry Seinfeld were mentioned.  The upcoming Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue featuring Barbie was discussed, leading to a personal anecdote from one host about his difficult childhood and parental neglect, including the use of racial slurs. The hosts discussed their childhood toys (G.I. Joe and Barbie) and violent playtime.  The conversation returned to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and a debate about Barbie's sisters, including the first African-American Barbie.  The hosts joked about their childhood and sibling relationships and violent playtime.  The show then introduced Richard Betts, author of "The Essential Scratch-and-Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert."  The hosts expressed skepticism and amusement, making vulgar and comedic comments about the book.  The interview with Betts was interspersed with inappropriate and offensive listener calls.  The interview covered the book's concept, Betts' background, and wine tasting.  Many commercials aired during this segment for jewelry, joint supplements, credit repair, pajamas, language learning programs, teddy bears, and dating websites.

The following segment continued the conversation about wine with Richard Betts, whose uncle is Dickie Betts of the Allman Brothers Band. They discussed his book (with scratch-and-sniff pages and cartoon noses), alcohol consumption, karaoke, and Betts’ personal life.  The conversation then shifted to school closings due to the snowstorm, playing humorous school announcements including parodies of "Ice Ice Baby."  The segment ended with a discussion of Cameo's "Word Up" and a reminiscence of a past Opie and Anthony turkey hunt stunt, mentioning Limp Bizkit's cover of George Michael's "Faith" and Fred Durst's presence at the hunt.  Several celebrities, including Bruce Jenner and various musicians, were mentioned.


The final segment began by identifying a film location in a video as Long Island City, leading to a discussion about Ziggy, a former SiriusXM employee.  A host's "fake sick" day was discussed, followed by a digression about Limp Bizkit's breakup and music.  A significant portion involved a karaoke rendition of Ace of Base's "The Sign," with attempts to synchronize audio with the music video.  Listeners were asked to create and send a synced version.  The hosts criticized Fred Durst, with one host defending him.  Upcoming tour dates and their podcast (featuring Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan) were mentioned.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the karaoke.  The post-show, hosted by Sam Roberts, recapped the show, highlighting the "Bad Guest Day" with Richard Betts.  The post-show included listener calls, further discussion of the Ace of Base karaoke, and Valentine's Day-themed advertisements.

[00:01:00]  And welcome. We are live. 866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number. 866-969-1969. So call in to the  Opie and Anthony pre-show live here on a Thursday. One day before Valentine's Day, 2014.  2014. You see it all over the news. It's a national story. The snowstorm is destroying 
[00:01:30]  the country. I guess yesterday it was leaving Atlanta looking like the Walking Dead again.  I feel so bad for those people over there. A little bit of snow and the entire city collapses.  But that's the thing. When you're not used to it, that's what happens. Here in New York,  it snowed overnight. I mean, it really seemed like a World War III scenario coming. But it wasn't too 
[00:02:00]  bad last night. I do wonder if Ant will get in. I think he will. So far, this season has been full  of winter storms here in New York. And Ant has managed to find his way from Long Island to New  York City every single time. Today, every day remains a different story, though. We'll see what 
[00:02:30]  happens. Opie, of course, will be here. Jim, of course, will be here. And I personally believe  that Anthony will be here as well. A lot to get into today. Of course, a winter storm means local  news coverage. And Opie has made it perfectly clear there is nothing that he likes better right  now than local news coverage. When they panic, and it's been funny watching the local news,  because as you go on, they don't know how to sensationalize it anymore. Because they've used 
[00:03:00]  all their tricks already. You know what I mean? They've sat there. They did the frozen t-shirt thing  way early in the season. Like, they were like, oh my god, it's extremely cold today. They didn't  realize it's the beginning of January. It was going to be extremely cold every day. And now  they're stuck with an empty bag of tricks. So I'm interested to hear Opie's take on how  the news was handling this whole thing yesterday. Let's start with some phone calls, and we'll  go to Larry in Tennessee. How's it going, Larry? 
[00:03:30]  It's going okay, Sammy. Out here playing in the snow. You know how she goes.  Are you a trucker? Are you driving through the snow?  Oh yeah, of course. That's my life. Of course, I'm sitting here, waiting, oh gosh, waiting  for this light to ever change. I don't think it's going to. I'm fixing to run a red light.  Do it, Larry. Do it.  Half as long as I've waited. I am right now as we speak. But guys are doing a lot of breaks  on the Olympics, which is cool. It's amazing. You know, they talk about the sports, and like 
[00:04:00]  all of a sudden, they'll talk about the sports. It's completely gone, and they discuss  the female attributes of the athletes that are actually performing, and ignoring what  you're performing on, you know, for all of our enjoyment. And I wonder, with all that  you're detailing of the snow in New York City, you professional broadcaster, you're actually  getting more snow there than they are at the Olympic venue.  I mean, they may very well be. Thank you, Larry. They may very well be getting more snow  here stateside than they have in Sochi. Some snowboarding is going on on TV right now. But 
[00:04:30]  yesterday's Olympic coverage was making me laugh all day. Opie, I mean, I guess everybody  kind of puts the Olympic athletes on a pedestal, because they work so hard at achieving these  goals and accomplishments once every four years, that it's like, wow, we finally let  them have their time to shine. Let's play what happened yesterday, when Opie was describing 
[00:05:00]  some of the Olympic performers. That's track two.  That ski thing they were doing last night, I don't even know what they call it, the freestyle?  Oh.  Where it looks like you're snowboarding, sort of, because you're going down the rails and  stuff, but you're on skis, and then they do the two or three amazing jumps? Yeah. One  broad went down the hill backwards over the big jump. By the way, Opie says, this is a  woman that's worked to aspire to get to the Olympics. They love being called broads. And 
[00:05:30]  she's relegated to being a broad. They love being called broads. I love that. All the work  that went into being on the Olympic team. Good for them. Some baby machine went down backwards.  Did you see that slit take the jump? Well, I'll challenge you. We're all watching the  Olympics a little bit here and there. Name five. Name five athletes. Exactly. They know  each other. I just go, wow, look at the broad going down the hill backwards over the huge 
[00:06:00]  jump and landing backwards. That was amazing, but I don't know her name. It was all disrespect  yesterday. All day, Opie was calling all the female Olympic athletes broads. Look at  this broad. Who taught this broad how to curl? Let's go to Snowy in Michigan. Today, it's  Snowy in New York. What's up, Snowy? Actually, it's not so snowy here for change. The 99 list  of desirable women, I was curious. I don't have access to the computer. I don't know all the 
[00:06:30]  names that are mentioned. But did Ann say yes to a single woman that wasn't...  A little darker than white, actually. A little bit, maybe, but...  That's a great question, Snowy. Yesterday, we did go... I mean, you talk about showing  no respect to anybody. Yesterday, we did go over the 99 hottest women or 99 most desirable  women. Ask men put it out. And I don't think that Ant said yes to any woman of any sort of  color. Unless I'm missing somebody. I think all yeses were Caucasian. In Ant's case, I 
[00:07:00]  guess that's not a huge surprise. It just happens to be his personal preference. Huh. But the  funniest part of yesterday... I think that was the funniest part of yesterday's show, was  listening to these guys just go through the entire list, all 99, and just disgustedly saying  no to some of the hottest women in the world. Like, some of the hottest women that Hollywood 
[00:07:30]  has to offer. Opie and Anthony didn't like the fact that they were placed on that list.  So we went through all 99. And listening back, I would say the majority of those 99 women  got no's from Opie and Anthony. And it was almost a no as if, no, I wouldn't give her,  this Hollywood actress, I wouldn't give Cate Blanchett the honor of sleeping with me, Opie  or Anthony, no! Of course, Jim predictably said yes to 99 of the 99. But there was one awkward 
[00:08:00]  moment. Chelsea Peretti made the list of the hottest, of the most desirable 99 women out  there right now. And Chelsea Peretti, I mean, she's kind of blown up as of late. You know  her from Brooklyn 99. Her Twitter feed is crazy. She was a writer on Parks and Rec. But she  used to live in New York. She used to date Jim. She was friends with Opie's wife. So I knew 
[00:08:30]  Chelsea Peretti was coming up on the list. And the guys were so quick to say no to people.  It got awkward. Here's what happened when we realized Chelsea Peretti was number 37 on the  most desirable list. No. Chelsea Peretti. This is getting nice now. This is getting a little  personal. Well, you said no already, Opie. You said no and then said it's not. Because she's like  our sister. Chelsea Peretti. No. No. No. Of course I do. I'm saying no because it's a, that's more of a 
[00:09:00]  like, it's a sister thing. I can't even think of her that way. She's very high on the list. Number 37.  She's very high on the list. I did notice when we were hanging out a lot of airports. She's in very  good shape. Yes. Phenomenal. And she is becoming a massive star. I know. It's amazing. Somebody really  wants that Brooklyn 99 show to be very big. Because they keep giving it attention. But she's the star  of the show. I know. They said in the paper the other day, she's the number one reason to watch  over Sandberg. Ouch. Jesus. Chelsea's going to be massively successful in LA now. She just got no's. 
[00:09:30]  She got, she got a yes. One yes. But I'm explaining the no because it's a weird sister thing. She slept,  she has slept over my house. Oh shit. Mine too. Alana Blanchard. Mine too. This is what happens  when you make jokes at people's expenses and then stumble upon somebody you actually know. It was so  great. Because you heard at the beginning of the clip, Opie shouted no as soon as the picture came  up. But I think that's just because he was ready to say no to everybody. He just wanted to smash 
[00:10:00]  whoever was coming up next and didn't realize that it was going to be a friend. It went further.  This was really interesting to me. Marissa Mayer, who's the CEO of Yahoo, somehow made it on the list  of the 99 most desirable women. And Jim and his theories sometime leave me perplexed because he's  got a lot more experience with the perverse sexuality that he talks about than I do. So all I can do is 
[00:10:30]  take his word on it. But it's the stuff that would never occur to me. This was Jim's reaction when  Marissa Mayer popped up on the 99 most desirable list. Marissa Mayer. No. Who is she? She's the CEO of  Yahoo, I believe, right? Look at me. Get her out of here. With her dumb fucking Hillary Clinton mom  hair. She's horrible. Get out of here. She's a CEO. She's not fun. I think she might get kicked out  soon too. I think she kind of is fucking up a little bit. For being too hot? Yeah, right. Exactly. I'll say no. If she's a CEO, 
[00:11:00]  she probably likes being spanked. And she probably, I'm telling you, if she's that powerful, she's  probably a big sub, man. Big sub in the bed. Yeah. Iraq runs in where? No. Big sub in the bed. Sorry.  That may very well be true. I don't know for sure. But I just think it's funny because it's the type of  stuff that would never occur to me to even think about. I mean, how could you have that information  possibly? And it's not the first time Jim has done that. There have been guests that come in here  and their publicists are kind of bossing them around. And Jim has sat there and wondered 
[00:11:30]  if the publicist and the celebrity that they've brought in have some kind of dominatrix  relationship. And I'm like, can't the publicist just be a bitch? Does there have to be a sexual  element to the relationship? But maybe there is. What do I know? Ralph in Ohio, welcome  to the Opie and Anthony pre-show. Yeah. Dude, Alana Blanchard, the one you guys kind 
[00:12:00]  of went back to, you guys were like, ah, no. And then you guys went back, yeah. That  chick, you see her pictures online. She's a surfer girl that was friends with the one that  got her arm bit off by the shark. Yeah. She is ridiculously high. She's surfing a thong  like all year long. She's only surfing a thong. I know who you're talking about. That  girl is ridiculous. Ridiculous. Well, Ralph, the thing about the whole, the whole reading  of the list was that they were totally intolerant of almost any female. Like there were women 
[00:12:30]  that they knew were hot on that list, but because the picture that Ask Men put up wasn't  good, they got a big no from Opie and Anthony. I mean, who was the, uh, the actress? Emma?  Watson? No, not Emma Watson. It's the girl from Superbad. Emma Stone. Emma Stone was on the  list. And I'm going, that's an obvious yes, right? No! No! It was the greatest thing I'd  ever heard. Listen to it on demand if you didn't hear it or catch it over the weekend. 
[00:13:00]  Well, as we move right along with the Opie and Anthony pre-show, a bunch of us were in,  stuck in the city last night. We weren't really stuck, but we stay up in hotels when there's  any worry that the essential members of the Opie and Anthony crew won't be in attendance  for the show. For instance, I know that I have to be here to hype up this show for you  guys. So there's no chance that there's snow in the forecast that I'm going back to West  Chester. With that said, a lot of people are wondering, Sam, what do you got in your juice 
[00:13:30]  today? What'd you blend up today? I don't have one today because I didn't have my blender  with me, but Opie started the show yesterday, of course, answering the question on everybody's  mind. What is in his NutriBullet that morning? Oh, thanks for asking. Today, Anthony, it's  kale, spinach, half a banana. Went with nonfat yogurt. I'm just waiting for the boost. Pineapples.  What is it? Fuck, I forgot my boost! Oh, shit. I swear to God, I forgot my boost. All right, 
[00:14:00]  put me here. I'll tug a few into it. Fuck! Please give me a little boost, too. On my back.  You son of a bitch, it was so early, I forgot my boost. Oh, man. Because I make these things  half asleep. Oh, no. But I didn't forget my frozen pineapple chunks and my frozen blueberries.  My frozen blueberries. That sounds good. Doesn't matter how delicious everything you put in  it, it always winds up looking like fucking, like the exorcist puke. It really does. It 
[00:14:30]  looks like liquid baby shit no matter what you're drinking, but you gotta have a boost. You know  what I mean? There's no reason to do it if you don't have that. Let's go to my pal  Struff in Boston. Struff, welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, stay, everybody. It's a little bit early, and I haven't quite opened my eyes yet.  Sounds like fun. Can I get a time check, please?  Of course you can, Struff. It is 14 after the hour, only 16 minutes to go before Opie and  Anthony take the airwaves.  Ah, that's so cool. That's so awesome. And by the way, this little message for Larry.  Larry, Larry, don't give up. Larry, I love that you're sort of taking over the love of 
[00:15:00]  Sam that I've always had, and I'm glad that you're spreading the word and passing the torch  around the country or whatever.  Whatever, Struff. You're a giver, but you'll be more of a giver once you actually wake up.  Yeah, that's it.  All right, I'll talk to you later, buddy.  See you, pal.  Struff has been there since day one. Struff was the original Larry. A lot of stuff to get  into today on the show. Derek Jeter announced his retirement. He said this is going to be 
[00:15:30]  his last season on the Yankees. Look, if you're in New York and you're going to retire and  you're Derek Jeter, wait till the day that there's not snow in the forecast, because the news  is going crazy with the snow and Derek Jeter automatically becomes story number two. It  was a shame. The other thing I wanted to mention before we move on completely from the list that  we got into yesterday, the 99 Most Desirable Women, I couldn't take that list seriously because  pal from 90 Day Fiancé was nowhere to be found. You got 99 spots. You can't give pal one. 
[00:16:00]  It's ridiculous. Well, a lot of stuff happening on the show yesterday. Now we've gone through,  you hear the callers on the pre-show every day. Calling the Opie and Anthony show is an art  form and calling can go wrong. For instance, one call just exhausted everybody in the room  yesterday. Sal, let's go to track five. And I don't see how any call is going to be more  exhausting this week than Chris in, not Chris, whoever this guy was yesterday. That's track 
[00:16:30]  five. There's something going on with Scott Shannon. Hold on a second. JP in Rhode Island.  What's up, JP? JP in Long Island. I hope it was in front of the toilet, Jay. Yeah, you would  hate to get it all over the bath, Matt. I'm, I'm, I'm C, P, and C. Chip. I messed up.  You certainly did. Yes, sir. The first time I actually listened to Scott and Todd show was 
[00:17:00]  the day that he said he was leaving and was in the car and there was actually people started  calling in and there was an O and A call, an O and A fan and he was, uh, he didn't say anything  about O and A show. At the end of the call, he basically was like, oh, I love you. Uh, I love you.  I miss, I'm going to miss you and I'm going to miss you on the other show too. And then he's like,  oh, I didn't, I didn't, I don't know what he's talking about. He quickly hung up on him. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, okay. Wow. Yeah. That was a long way around it, my friend.  Yeah, but that made a lot of sense. Wow. A little nervous. Are you the same guy on Twitter  too? Yeah. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus H. Christ. All right, sir. Thank  you. I'm a big fan. But no, there was other shit on there that you could have pulled from  where how he hates saying that, uh, he's retiring. And then, um, and then after that, he was taking 
[00:18:00]  phone call, uh, from just, um, his friends and shit. And, uh, basically. Xbox, sign out.  Xbox, sign out. Xbox, sign out. Oh, Jesus. Oh, my goodness gracious. What happened there? Oh,  my God. The phones have been going very well lately too. Yes. Right up till that call. Oh,  Jesus. Now, I believe very strongly in supporting our listeners, but sometimes calling does indeed 
[00:18:30]  go wrong. That wasn't the only guy. By the way, a little update on what's going on in  the studio right now. We're broadcasting out of our closet studio here live on the Opie  and Anthony pre-show. We can see what happens in the main room. Opie and Anthony and Club  Soda Kenny are all in the building, ladies and gentlemen. This show is going to go off without  a hitch today. And let me tell you something. It's going to be one of the best of all time.  Hopefully, we didn't get into it yesterday. There's that case going on in Florida right 
[00:19:00]  now about the guy that shot and killed, I guess. Or maybe he didn't. I think he killed  him. The black teenager. He got out of his car and was shooting at his SUV and he drove  away and the black teen ended up dying. That guy took the stand. It's been all over the  news. I'd love to hear what Anthony has to say about that and get his take on it. Because  the guy's claiming self-defense, but his wife is kind of contradicting his testimony. It's  very, it's a very interesting case. And I love hearing Ant's take on the gun cases because 
[00:19:30]  generally, it's an opinion that's not heard very often in the mainstream media. And whether  you agree or disagree with it, it's important to hear it. It's important. As I was saying  though, calling does sometimes go terribly, terribly wrong. That wasn't the only call to go wrong  yesterday. I mentioned Chris in Rochester earlier. This was, this was Chris in Rochester's call.  And this, I don't know how this bit still works with you guys. I don't know how this bit still 
[00:20:00]  works with the people who supposedly listened to this show, but it did yesterday. This was  Chris in Rochester's call. Chris in Rochester. Chris.  Morning, boys. Hey, buddy.  Long time, long time. Here's a lame joke for the day. It's a good thing to  Chinese women are only used to getting two inches.  Your phone crapped out, dude. I hate when that happens. Your phone is  messed up, dude. Yeah. Fucking T-Mobile. It's a good 
[00:20:30]  thing that the Chinese women are used to getting two inches. Chris, are you there? Chris?  Oh, hello? It's a good thing, we hear Chinese and you're crapping  out a little bit. I hear some Chinese. Are you on the road?  You're a fucking asshole, Martin. It's a good thing. Wait, wait. Hold on. He's not being  for real. He can't hear you. Your phone is crapping out, dude. Are you on the road?  I am on the road. I'm off to a big job interview today. Okay. Try one more time. We can hear you  now. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. Sounds clear. Sorry about that. It's a good thing that the 
[00:21:00]  Chinese women are used to only getting two inches. Now you're messing with us. You're doing  this on purpose. You're saying Chinese. You stopped talking midway through. You're messing around.  Are you fucking with us? Are you doing a joke or are you being for real?  No, I'm being for real. All right. I won't say anything nobody's saying. Just one more  time, but slow down and stop moving your phone or whatever it is you're doing. Sorry, Chris.  Can you hear me now? Yes. Oh, that's funny. Okay. Okay. All right. The lame joke of the  day. Okay. It's a good thing. We heard you. Oh, was he just going for it? What an idiot. 
[00:21:30]  Clear as a bell every time.  And it really does work every time. Sal was just saying that his favorite part of that  clip is listening to Jim clear his throat right before he gets into the we heard you.  I mean, that's happening multiple times a week now, and it's not fake, but it can happen 
[00:22:00]  to anybody. I think Ant proved that yesterday. It can happen right to a person's face. Let's  hear something similar happening to Ant yesterday. That's Trek 10.  Someone wrote us and said 300 million people speak English in China. No, it's 600,000. There's  600,000 expats that live there. So that's the whole community. In Shanghai or China? In  Shanghai. Okay. So there's like an English radio station. What's that? What? I actually  didn't hear you. I'm sorry. I was talking over. What did you say? I didn't hear the huge 
[00:22:30]  God. Are you going to say expats? I didn't think they were. I heard you. Oh, God. Fucking  right here. It's harder than it looks, I suppose. It's harder than it looks. Let's go to some  calls. 866-WOW-1-WOW-866-969-1969 here on the Opie and Anthony pre-show. Peter on Long  Island.  Sam, prime time. Yo, I have a problem that only you can help with. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  I just don't know what to get my girl for Valentine's Day, and no one seems to be giving  me any insight.  Well, that's one thing you can look forward to, listening to the Opie and Anthony show  today, especially if you listen during the breaks. I think old Opie and Anthony might  have a few ideas. Maybe some gold-dipped roses or chocolate-dipped strawberries or teddy bears  or pajamas with holes in them. I don't know, but I think they may be able to help you out  with that later today. 
[00:23:30]  Thank God.  Thank you, Peter. It's Valentine's Day. The only thing worse is Mother's Day. Walter on  Long Island. What's up, Walter?  Hey, Sam. Good morning.  Morning.  On the Derek Jeter, a couple years ago, the Post ran an article about when he would have  his hookups, and he'd send the girls off with a signed baseball. Did you read about  that? Did you hear about that?  No, but I loved that move.  But listen, and then the one woman, the one broad that hooked up with him, she, and the 
[00:24:00]  reason why they knew it, because she had two, because he didn't realize that he had hooked  up with her twice. Obviously, she knew, but it was her second go-round. But this year...  Oh, so she got two signed balls.  She got two...  This year, Steiner Sports is putting out a commemorative, G, to sign ball. Any of the  hoes out there that can sleep with Derek this year, if they can get that signed ball, they're  going to be golden.  Yeah, you're right. You're right. Get Brandon Steiner on the phone. I'm sure he can get  a nice supply. Thank you, Walter. I love that move. Giving him a signed ball. I'm sure 
[00:24:30]  you're a fan. That'd be like me, like, hooking up with girls and giving him a Not Sam t-shirt  at the end of it. And they go, Sam, like, I'm ashamed that I did this in the first place.  You really think I want a t-shirt? That's insane. What ego on that guy. I love it. He  should have an ego. He's the darling of New York, whatever he does. I'll bet he leaves  baseball and just hooks up with chicks on the reg. Like, that's all he's going to do  now. I would think that at least for a couple years, he'll still have that good clout with  the women of New York, that he'll still be able to do that. So it's amazing. It's amazing 
[00:25:00]  what this guy's done. I'm sure that they'll get into Derek Jeter today on the Opie and Anthony  show. Something that I was laughing my balls off yesterday. You heard on an earlier clip  here on the pre-show, Opie making reference to Xbox sign out. There was a video that we  watched yesterday. Apparently now you can talk to your Xbox. That's with the new Xbox. And  when you say Xbox sign out to it, the system signs out. It shuts down. So somebody made  his Xbox username, Xbox sign out, because he knew that the people when he was online 
[00:25:30]  gaming, people would be yelling that at the screen when he did things to them. And he  made a video of all the people yelling it and being like, no, no, no, I don't want to sign  out to the Xbox. Let's listen to the video and the guys listening to it yesterday.  Did you see that video of this guy who plays Call of Duty and his gamer tag is Xbox sign  out? His Xbox sign out. And then he just gets in people's way. Right. And they go, move  Xbox sign out. No, no. That's hilarious. It's really funny, man. Xbox sign out. No, no, 
[00:26:00]  no, no, no, no, no. Get out of my way. You freaker. Xbox sign out. Xbox sign out. Get out of  my way. I don't want to say this, but whose name is Xbox sign out. Oh, I want to say this  guy's gamer tag, but it will end up signing me out. Oh, Xbox signed out. Catch me. No, 
[00:26:30]  I didn't mean to sign out. I just said his name and it also like put me into the thing  where it says my Xbox. Wait, no, Xbox don't. Don't do it. His name is really clever. Fuck  me. I almost did it. What do you want Xbox sign out? Oh, crap. Oh, I see why his name 
[00:27:00]  is that. Clever. I almost signed out. Oh, I get it. They found the one girl who plays  Xbox online. Chris in Brooklyn. What's up, buddy? Yeah. How you doing? The whole thing  about Jeter, he had it down to a science. He actually had when the girls left, he had a 
[00:27:30]  town call with him and in the back, it was actually a gift basket with a DVD. You said  a t-shirt, candy, flowers. So sleeping with Derek Jeter was like visiting the Tonight Show.  Oh, you leave with a gift basket. Yeah, a swag bag. Every girl who sleeps with Derek Jeter  goes home with turtle wax. And that's what happened. She realized, because it wasn't just  a ball. It was a whole thing, like a package. Oh, that's great. She got two of them. What 
[00:28:00]  a pimp. What a pimp this Derek Jeter is. A true gem of New York City. Speaking of gems,  you heard one voice on a clip that you might not have been familiar with. That was Jesse Joyce.  He was on the show yesterday, and he got into a great story about driving drunk across five  states. This was, I don't remember if this was his rock bottom or not, but this is one of the  scariest things I've ever heard. I can't imagine living through this. Jesse Joyce, he's traveled 
[00:28:30]  all over the place. He's one of the premier roast writers in the country. He writes for every roast.  And most of the jokes that get picked up in the newspapers and stuff, all the Comedy Central  roasts, they're his jokes. But he was, he's a, I guess he's a recovering alcoholic. I don't know  if you call him a former alcoholic. He's not drinking anymore. But he got into what happened  yesterday when he drove across five states completely blacked out. But I got out of five  previous DUIs. That's gotta be a record. And then the sixth one is the one that got, but I, the whole 
[00:29:00]  time, and I blackout drunk drove across four states. I told you about that. And so like,  all of that shit made me go like, oh dude, it was amazing. Like, cause most people were like,  oh, so that's why you quit. And I was like, absolutely not. Like that convinced me I'm  the best drunk driver of all time. Exactly. I'm fucking great at this. You know? You really  don't remember being in four states? Not a fucking minute of it. Not a minute of that drive.  So I was convinced when I woke up in the hotel that I was still stuck in Kentucky. Like I had not 
[00:29:30]  left. You woke up at a hotel and realized you were four states over? I realized it was,  it took me a minute to figure out I was in a different hotel. Wow. Is that fucked up?  Like I went to bed, to the best of my knowledge, I passed out, like I went to bed in the one  hotel. And so when I woke up, I was like, fuck, I'm late. Back to the hotel. And then I was  like, holy shit, I'm, I made it. How far of a drive was it? Like, were you just like  10 hours? Oh my God. Like no recollection at all. Even when you start really thinking about  it. I fucking drove through a rush hour somewhere. I got gas at some point. You know,  Jesse Joyce calling in, coming in yesterday. Great guest today. As far as guests go, we 
[00:30:00]  have an author calling in who wrote a scratch and sniff wine book. I'm interested to see  how that will go. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge. Also, a Texas sportscaster went viral with his  report on Michael Sam, the gay college football player who is looking to become an NFL  football player. Of course, the winter storm. Of course, the Olympics. Derek Jeter. This 
[00:30:30]  Florida shooting. The death of Sid Caesar. We got into Mom's Mabley yesterday. I'm sure  we'll get into Sid Caesar today. All that and a whole lot more right now, because that's  when the Obie and Anthony show begins. 
[00:31:00]  that bomb saying doesn't succeed at the beginning. I'm sure we need to make a  play this thing. You can change it. I get into  a cloud, add with what's going on. You can certainly stand it in you and happen on the  table with another honor. What does it show that?  To a child in your mind and every one of us, who with the future or not  broad and everything, we're watching thats perioden, but you should enjoy this time. I can see that 
[00:31:30]  there's a place where we just knew it. You can 손z官 on the scene with profund Rey but you know this is  a weathered man. You can be seeing several winters. You can see that. And if you haveこと  but we're going to be the closest. And yet on number one of estaban, you have to be lo gadgets.  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  The year 1994.  From the murky banks of terrestrial radio, a new hope begins to rise.  Opie and Anthony are radio shock jocks known for setting up outrageous stunts.  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's greatest duo. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It was beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show.  The other show there is.  Through 55-gallon drums and whiffle ball backs.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayors.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys. 
[00:35:00]  With bottle rockets and bra bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the cocks.  They've met friends along the way.  Is this Jim Norton?  I have a raging hard-on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations, 
[00:35:30]  it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Of course he's guilty.  Guilty.  Guilty.  He's guilty because he's a politician. 
[00:36:00]  Guilty.  That's what makes him guilty.  Guilty.  And because he...  Ray Nagin.  He's the latest.  Ray Nagin.  What is he, the Chocolate City mayor?  Chocolate City.  He was, yeah, we remember him from Katrina.  Right.  He was the mayor of Nolens and apparently had his hand in the old cookie jar.  He loved taking money and favors and marble, apparently, or granite.  Boy, did he.  Yeah.  No surprise, though.  Nah.  At this point, you see a politician getting arrested or in trouble. 
[00:36:30]  You're like, huh, whatever.  Oh, he's taking...  Whatever.  ...faking shit.  They're all fucking pieces of shit.  They really are.  The fuck is...  Man, I was a good sledder.  I could have been in the Olympics.  Oh, yeah.  That's sledding, right?  They just...  They just gave it a fancy name?  You think you could have done that?  I'm not talking about the luge.  The luge, you go down feet first.  This sport, you go down head first.  The skeleton.  The skeletor.  The skeleton. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  It's just sledding, right?  It's pretty much the same thing you did on a sled.  Some people just don't stop sledding.  They keep sledding and end up in the Olympics.  Yeah.  Remember at some point, you were like, ah, I don't feel like doing this.  I'm going to go fucking hang out with some chicks.  Yeah, I like girls now, so I'm not going to sled anymore with my friends.  I'm going to go smoke some weed or something.  Yeah.  These people just kept sledding.  Dude, this guy's chin is...  Look at where his chin is.  It can't be more than a half inch off the ice as he's flying down this course. 
[00:37:30]  That's cray.  That is cray cray.  She's looking very good and very stable.  How do you know she's looking very good?  They're a tiny skid, but controlled that much better than Pika's pace.  What is she doing to control that?  Time remains in the green and almost three-tenths of a second.  Her margin of advantage is growing.  Jesus, how fast is that?  She had a little bit of hype, but overall we're seeing...  Scary shit right there. 
[00:38:00]  Fuck that.  Oh, and she's come back to Noel just a little bit.  The time started to swing back the other way.  Still overall quickest at the moment.  Up and down.  These uphill sections make this race exciting.  Which is basically a fucking quadra.  Stephen Hawking could do this.  That would be fun to watch.  Give us a second quicker than Pika's pace.  I don't know.  Yay.  I don't know what that was.  I would never do a sport where there's so much luck involved.  Like these, quote, athletes.  I think if you're on a sled, you're not an athlete. 
[00:38:30]  Sorry.  You just hold on for dear life.  If you're allowed to be...  If you could be pregnant and do your sport, it's not...  It's not...  You're not an athlete.  No.  Athlete.  Supposedly some of the curling broads are pregnant.  What?  Pregnant?  I think last Olympics one of them was pregnant.  So that's not...  You can't be pregnant.  That's not a sport.  If you're in a sport.  If you worry about your eye makeup, it's not a sport.  Right.  But that sledding, the luge, the bobsled, there seems to be so much luck involved. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  And the times are so close.  Right.  So what?  Between sucking and winning.  Yeah.  You're training your whole life to maybe win or lose by one hundredth of a second.  That sounds crazy to me.  And if anyone could get in there and just lose by, you know, a couple of hundreds of  a second.  Right.  Eh.  I don't know.  And then just one bump or if you're getting a weird groove on the course for a  split second, then that fucks up your whole time.  Yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:39:30]  There's too much chance involved there, I think.  I do believe.  We do like watching people get on stuff and go fast, though.  So.  Right.  We enjoy watching that.  Absolutely.  Another fucking snowstorm.  Yeah.  This is unbelievable.  I can't remember the last time we had so many storms in one winter.  It's like, I guess, the same once a week.  We're getting on one a week.  Amazing, right?  Yeah.  Are we setting snow total records or?  I don't think so.  We're still not, huh? 
[00:40:00]  They haven't been these huge accumulation storms.  Right.  But they're very inconvenient.  They've been during rush hour and stuff like that and on work days.  And they're icy.  It's been very cold, so nothing melts.  Right.  So it just keeps piling up.  Man, if Atlanta had the storm we're getting today, I can only imagine.  They would have to destroy the city.  They would have to destroy the city.  They finally, you know, decided to keep all the kids home from school and city workers and non-essential personnel. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  So that cleared the roads, so it wasn't like it was the last storm.  But, yeah, Long Island was pretty icy and slushy, kind of hard to drive in.  But the good thing is the news scares the shit out of people so much that no one comes in to work.  I guess a lot of people can just work from home these days.  So, yeah, the roads were pretty clear.  There was no one on the roads.  So I got them pretty easy.  I remember when we used to drive in together. 
[00:41:00]  The best days were these.  Yeah.  Because you're right.  There was no idiots on the road.  That's it.  They got all scared.  You got a nice, you know, fucking SUV.  You got to stay home.  Get through this shit.  It's very dangerous out there.  The news said I could die.  Gil in Boston.  What's up?  Hey, I'll put it on, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Gil.  Hey, I definitely feel your pain with the sports, but they do call it the Olympic Games and not the Olympic sports.  Games.  Oh, okay.  But they do call them athletes.  Olympic athletes. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  All right.  Good point.  All right.  Thank you.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You got me.  You got me on that one.  Now I'll have to think about that all day.  Right.  Did you watch the Olympics last night?  You know what?  See the women's downhill?  That was pretty impressive.  I didn't.  Were they tied?  Oh, yeah.  They tied for the gold?  Tied for the gold.  And one of them is some really hot chick who's like, I don't know, a pop star in a tiny little country.  Really? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  She had a nice little story line.  Ooh.  They did her story line last night.  Was there any tragedy?  No, I didn't see any tragedy vignettes.  Can you do a story close and personal about someone with no tragedy?  I think one of the broads, their grandmother died or something.  Ah, right.  But once again, you know, that tends to happen when you get up into your 20s or so.  The grandparents start dying off.  They get a little frail on you.  Why do they?  So there's no real surprise there. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  See, they tied for the fucking gold medal.  Oh, look at that.  In the women's downhill.  The one on the right, she's some kind of pop star.  She has like the number one song.  Pop star.  Some weird little country, so.  Oh, yeah?  No one in America has heard of her, but I guess she's a huge rock star.  Good for her.  Where she's from, so.  No, I really was kind of steering clear of the old Olympics last night.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Playing video games.  Mm-hmm.  Nothing really exciting.  Just waiting for the big snowfall. 
[00:43:00]  Here's another sledder.  Oh, running with his sled.  That is a great shot of the one-handed start on Skeleton.  You can see how awkward it can be to push that sled.  Yeah, they call it Skeleton.  It's a sled.  He's sledding.  Already a little bit unstable up here at the top.  This is where you maintain your velocity.  I guess you steer with your foot a little.  Your feet hang over the edge, so you kind of put him down or put him out a little. 
[00:43:30]  What the fuck?  That's crazy, though.  And we see that similar line.  It's pretty fucking cool looking.  We see everybody take that so far.  Hide on the end of five.  If he went right into something head first, he'd probably hurt himself.  Oh, I bet.  She manages a decent entry coming into nine.  Everyone is getting hung up on the end there, and what that does is it makes a really tough  entry into turn ten, and you can see the height that it made on the end.  Put those mics right on the track to make it sound really cool.  I like that.  She is down on her teammates' time.  Whoa.  Whoa.  She got a little squirrely.  That's going to hurt her.  Putting on the bracelet that is going to cost her. 
[00:44:00]  Got a little squirrely.  I guess.  And look at the speed difference compared to Yarnold.  75 miles an hour.  Whoa.  Second down.  She went slow at 75 miles an hour?  75 miles an hour was slowed way down.  And when I see these weird sports, I wonder, like, where do you find these courses where  you can even practice?  Do you have to just move somewhere?  Yeah, how do you practice that shit?  Where do you go?  You can't build that in your backyard, like Gretzky's story with his hockey rink in his  yard.  You can't fucking build a luge or a toboggan track. 
[00:44:30]  How come they don't slip when they're running, huh?  There you got some weird spiky sneaks.  Sneaks, whatever the fuck they are.  Paul in Toronto.  Paul.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Last time, first time here.  Oh, good.  Thank you so much, Paul.  Who gives a shit?  What's up?  Have you guys seen the two-man luge?  Yeah, that's really gay.  I don't think they have that anymore.  I think they finally realized how gay it was, and they don't do it anymore.  That was why they had it yesterday. 
[00:45:00]  I saw some yesterday.  Two-man?  Yesterday?  I heard they got rid of the two-man luge.  I haven't seen it.  I thought it was extinct.  You sure?  Huh?  Two-pices.  Which guy is on top and which guy is on the bottom?  How do you talk another man into doing the two-man luge with you?  Is that a real question?  I think I still do it.  If you guys look up the IGLA, which is the International Lesbian and Gay Association, something like that, they put it in a commercial.  You can get it on YouTube if you Google two-man luge and gay. 
[00:45:30]  Right.  They did a whole commercial that played here in Canada on how gay two-man luge was, which upset some of our losers.  Well, they're just goofing around?  There's no way someone would actually say that.  They apparently played this.  All right.  We'll try to find it.  Thank you, Paul.  Thank you, Paul.  Yeah, that two-man luge thing is strange.  Like, you're into luge-ing, and then you have to, like, approach a guy and go, hey, you know, I'd like you to be my luge partner. 
[00:46:00]  You'd like to, I don't know.  Yeah, it's like asking them out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it's very close to asking another guy out.  It's going steady.  You're a loser, and I'm a loser, and I was thinking that maybe we could do the two-man luge.  Don't you want me?  Oh, they're playing Don't You Want Me, Baby.  All right, wait, maybe there is something to it.  We'll tweak this out in a second after we watch it.  Oh, God.  Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion.  It looks like he's fucking him in the ass. 
[00:46:30]  Come on.  They edited this.  They didn't edit it.  They just slowed it down.  Yeah, slowed it down.  The start.  Where they both have to sway back and forth to get the luge going.  Games have always been a little gay.  Let's buy so fast.  I could keep it that way, it says.  Ah, that's lovely.  Right.  Because they have to push off, so they both have to sway back and then forward.  So do they still have it? 
[00:47:00]  They do the two-man luge in the Olympics?  I thought I heard that they don't do it anymore.  That's what I heard, too.  I heard they got rid of the two-man luge.  Two-man luge, too gay for Social Olympics.  What goof site is that?  Was that the onion?  Yeah.  Hammer in the news.  No, I think it's one of these goof sites, yeah.  It's satirical.  Right.  Yeah, I mean, there's another article that says Rob Ford mistakenly sues himself.  Yeah, okay.  Oh, see, that's not a real site. 
[00:47:30]  No, it's not true.  Okay.  We got a lot of GoPro shit that happened overnight.  I love those fucking GoPro...  I showed you the one of the fucking troopers or whatever the fuck chasing that guy.  Guy decides to run from the cops in his car, and they finally get him cornered in the woods.  Right.  Right at the entrance of the woods.  And he gets out of the car, and I guess the cop's got a helmet cam on or a chest cam or something.  He's got his gun out. 
[00:48:00]  Right.  He runs up to the car, and this guy gets out of his car.  His face is so funny.  He's scared shitless.  He screams like a girl.  He puts his fingers in his hair and pulls and screams.  It's so fucking funny, man.  It's a great chase, too.  It's, uh...  Yeah.  Looks like GTA.  The guy's got, like, a first-person perspective view.  Right.  He's got his Glock out the fucking window, pointing at the guy's car.  Flying down the wrong side of the highway for a little bit on the median.  Then the other car is way off in the grass, near the tree line, trying to get back on the highway. 
[00:48:30]  It's a good one.  And they finally corner him, and it's too bad it's a visual, and we don't have a visual element to the show.  That was an Arkansas game and fish guy?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  So what did he kill illegally?  What did he do that he's fucking pointing a gun at the guy?  I think they said he was wanted for armed robbery.  Oh.  Well, why the hell is the game and fish guy involved in it?  I guess it's their jurisdiction.  Maybe he stole fish.  He was robbing fish. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  From the fish store.  Or maybe he was just robbing fish, like, trying to get something from them.  No?  How about A. Vigoda?  Yeah.  We want to go this way.  Swedish gold.  Go to the end for the scream, even though it's a visual.  Yeah, he is fucking scared, pissless.  Here's where the guy's got his Glock out the window as he's still driving, and then the other  guy's driving on the grass near the tree line.  Hit it.  He's going a little further. 
[00:49:30]  He's going to go to the 33 and 1, sir.  Holy shit, is that guy fucking petrified. 
[00:50:00]  He really thought he was getting shot.  He puts his hands up, woo!  And then the wide open eyes.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Where are we going to put that?  On the Facebook and the Twitter?  O&A show on both, right?  Yes.  All right.  We'll do that for the people.  Most of them have seen it already.  Yeah, that's five stars he had on them right there. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, boy.  Did he have...  Well, no.  Four.  You've got to go four.  No helicopters.  No helicopters.  That's true.  That's true.  And then you've got the two people climbing up the world's second tallest building that's  still under construction.  Was that Shanghai?  Yeah.  I tweeted that yesterday as well.  This fucking video made my taint hurt.  I had such fucked up anxiety over this.  You don't have to play the whole...  It takes a while for them to get going.  Yeah.  But it looks like it's a couple of Ukrainian guys or something. 
[00:51:00]  They go up inside the building to the top?  Oh, wait till you see this.  Then we climb off.  Wait.  Here you go a little further.  They're there.  Euro trash music.  They're on the edge of the building just sitting there outside the building.  Oh, my God.  They're looking down at...  Turn that place.  They're looking down at extremely tall buildings that are way below them in the clouds.  They're coming through the clouds.  That's great.  And then they're going to the part that's still under construction. 
[00:51:30]  I'd be scared right here.  They're on the steps inside.  They're on the stairs that were still being built.  Fuck, yeah.  And now they get up on the crane.  All cloudy.  That is very cloudy.  What an amazing view.  And now they're just leaning over the side of the crane, looking down again at the buildings that are extremely tall, way below them in the clouds.  Now they're climbing up the actual crane.  Dan, dan, dan, dan.  Holy fuck, they got GoPros on, yeah.  Yeah, we did that.  We just started doing it. 
[00:52:00]  No, you didn't.  And then they...  Now they have to go kind of outside the crane to continue their climb.  And now they're just climbing on fucking a super structure.  Well, that's where the crane operator goes.  So now they're way above where the crane operator is.  They're trying to get to the tip of the crane.  Top of the crane.  The tip of crane.  I would never want to be a crane operator.  Fuck no.  They're just sitting up there, waiting for it to fall.  Now they're climbing through the middle of this super structure of the crane. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Wow.  And there's no ladder or anything.  They're just climbing up.  Is this freaking you out, Sam?  Yeah.  It just freaked me the fuck out yesterday when I saw it.  What are they holding on to?  Like a netting?  Like a fucking...  That's like a catwalk that goes up.  Up so you can climb.  It's meant for people to climb on, but I'm sure you're supposed to have your little safety harness.  Right.  Yeah, they don't have any safety shit at all.  It would be a lot scarier if there was no clouds.  Yeah, yeah, you know. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, they're climbing.  They're way above the building now.  They're way into the crane.  Oh, he's on the ladder.  And it's the second tallest building to begin with, with this crane on top of it.  We just felt like doing that until we did it.  You did not.  The crane has to be a couple, what, at least 100 feet?  Oh, yeah, man.  At least.  More than that.  Probably easy.  They're still climbing.  This gives me major anxiety.  Yeah, this one was not fun to watch yesterday. 
[00:53:30]  Wow.  There's still a lot more to go.  Yeah.  Now they're climbing way more carefully because they're getting to the top of this crane.  I would just, my body would just tell me that this crane's going to tip over because I'm in it.  And then how do you?  Then I would panic because you have to get back down.  You have to get down.  Right.  You'd have to jump.  You'd have to just die.  Yes.  You'd have to just die.  Oh, the wind.  I'd be afraid of being blown out between the little metal things.  Oh.  And then he's just looking down through the middle of the crane.  And that looks like it's forever. 
[00:54:00]  And now the guy's just climbing the side of this pulley thing.  It's like he gets slimed.  Holding on tight.  It's a helmet cam, which is scary because everything looks rounded.  Right.  On his dick.  On his dick.  Fat helmet.  Oh, and they're just enjoying the hell out of it like it's no big deal.  Well, where are they going?  It's almost done.  They have to go back down.  Yes, they do.  It's almost done.  Watch.  I don't like this.  Oh, they go outside.  Oh, look.  There's another climb thing.  That's helpful.  He's got to go on the outside.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Now he's at the tip. 
[00:54:30]  That is the tippy top of the crane.  I bet you that they're not supposed to be there.  He's standing on it.  He's just standing on the top of it.  There's nothing holding him.  He's not holding on.  That's high.  Yeah.  I'm going to high five.  Don't high five.  You're going to fall.  Don't high five.  Look at them.  Let those jump up.  They're very high.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Yeah.  We would just like, fuck it.  No, that wasn't you.  I tweeted that yesterday, but we'll tweet it and put it on our Facebook today. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, and a show on Twitter and Facebook.  Okay.  How do you get back down?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You got to.  You're a climb.  Yeah.  It would take forever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you'd be thinking, oh, I'm going to fall.  Yeah.  It's very stressful.  Yeah.  So stressful.  I don't know how you do that.  No.  I don't know how you do that.  It's terrifying.  You just don't.  There's another one I saw.  And they have gloves on.  You don't get a good grip when you have gloves on.  Yeah, because they're not like climbing gloves. 
[00:55:30]  They're like gloves.  They look like regular winter gloves.  What are you called out there?  I don't know what the word gloves.  These guys do this bare hands.  Most of them are like gymnasts, so it's probably much scarier for us.  But there was one, I don't know if you tweeted, where they're on the outside of a building and  they're just hanging, but he keeps hanging out with both hands and he keeps letting go  with one hand.  Oh, yeah.  And going back with another hand.  And then he turns behind him and he's hanging on backwards.  Right.  It's fucking terrifying.  It's really upsetting. 
[00:56:00]  And then you have assholes that dislike videos like that.  What was the problem with that video?  Yeah, they were scared.  Really?  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  What was the problem with that?  Fucking faggy.  Oh, no, I tweet all those videos because they're just fucking insane.  Yeah.  Insane.  When they do the one-arm push-ups.  Pull-ups, excuse me.  Yeah.  One-arm pull-ups.  Like, I just imagine, like, there was a time I was in pretty good shape.  I could do a bunch of pull-ups.  That time is right now. 
[00:56:30]  But what if all of a sudden they go, I know I can do five.  And all of a sudden at four, they're like, oh, fuck, I can't do the last one to get  me back up.  You can't get back up, and your hands are getting weaker.  Oh, that's frightening.  And you just see the tops of trees so far below trees.  How about other skyscrapers in this case?  Yeah, in this one, it's like you're way above the clouds.  The guy was standing on the top of it.  You know when you're doing pull-ups and your hands are a little sweaty, so you're like, 
[00:57:00]  I don't even know if I could hang on for this last one.  And then that slip thing.  See, I'm getting anxiety.  That whoosh, where it comes out of my hands.  He's like, ah.  Imagine feeling that when you're on there and just going, uh-oh, that's it.  But you go to the gym and you hang off something, right?  Yeah.  Like, I'll hang off some shit to stretch out my horrendous fucking middle-aged back.  But I know I'm not going to let go, right?  Right.  So now you do that exact same exercise from a skyscraper, you know, off the side of a skyscraper 
[00:57:30]  where it's a very long drop.  That's crazy.  There's not many people that would actually do that.  No.  No.  I know at the gym I'm never going to let go and fall the, what, the foot?  It's the old sidewalk over the Grand Canyon again.  With the bike?  Yeah.  You ride a bike on a sidewalk, you don't fall off the sidewalk.  Never.  But if it was going over the Grand Canyon, you would not be able to ride that bike over  that sidewalk.  Nine out of ten people would fucking die. 
[00:58:00]  You'd just fall off.  What is that?  For some reason, you'd fall off.  What happens to your stupid brain?  What is the problem?  I don't know.  Crazy Russians climb on top of a crane.  I don't know if this is the one.  I saw it there on the side of buildings, too.  Right.  I figured it was crazy something Russian.  They all start with crazy.  Yeah.  And they were fucking around on I-beams.  Yeah, that guy.  I hate this one.  I've seen this one.  It's so high up.  This is not the one I'm thinking of.  But look, you've got the one guy below the other guy doing just pull-ups.  On the bottom of an I-beam. 
[00:58:30]  That's hanging out.  And this guy's just doing push-ups.  But the problem is, the width of this thing is no more than, what, 12 inches?  We are in amazing shape.  Do not worry.  Very good.  And this one isn't that high up, but you see the trees below, and that's, you know,  it's going to kill you no matter what if you fall.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you're going to have a little bit of time to think about it.  And it's really windy up there.  Look at that one guy down below.  He's, like, dancing.  He's doing, like, breaking moves. 
[00:59:00]  But his shirt is blowing in the wind.  Now, how the fuck does he get back up?  Oh, my God.  You have to, like, oh, he's hanging below the I-beam doing pull-ups.  How does he get back up?  More high five.  I hate high five.  Ah!  He's about to go!  Wow.  This guy is doing pull-ups, but as he gets to the top of the pull-up, he lets go for a  split second.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a little gymnast.  And now he's doing that gymnast move where...  He's getting the cat.  But there's nothing below him. 
[00:59:30]  Nothing.  That's how the circus should be.  Yeah.  Come on.  Is there a wire on the guy?  You just don't see it?  Nope.  No.  Oh, my God.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, they're just doing these, like, push-ups in the air where you're balancing surely with  your...  Oh, my God.  The guy's hanging outside on the bottom of an I-beam.  Yeah.  Do not worry.  Holding on with his hands. 
[01:00:00]  Gets parallel to the ground.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They have strong grips.  Yeah.  You can just fall very easily.  Now this guy's decided to just balance.  He's balancing on the I-beam with one leg as it's really windy up there.  I'm doing some Tai Chi and then some Euro Trash Dance.  It's very windy.  Get the fuck out of here.  And then he would worry the other guy would fucking bump into you by accident. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, that's why I hate high fives.  I hate the high fives.  No high fives.  I don't like them either.  I don't even high five on the ground unless we both see them.  Exactly.  These videos are crazy.  Has there ever been an article about people that haven't made it?  You've got to think people have fucking died doing this shit.  Trying to make their video.  Yeah.  As far as these type of videos go, eh, you know.  That freaks me out.  Try People Are Awesome.  I don't know if that's what I'm thinking of. 
[01:01:00]  No, People Are Awesome is a great video.  It's my home movies.  Yes.  The R part.  The people and awesome are different.  I guess that's not it, Sam.  That's not it.  I wish I could remember the one I saw where the guys were hanging on the outsides of Bill.  It was like a bunch of different places.  It wasn't just where they were.  Wait a minute.  I hope there's a video of what this guy's about to describe.  Ron in Indianapolis.  Ron.  Ron, let's go.  Hey.  These guys came to actually one of the state fairs in Ohio, and we had actually went there, 
[01:01:30]  and they were falling from like a crane 40 feet in the eye in the air and grabbing a  hold of a crane that's like 15 feet down below, just falling down and grabbing them  and then flicked back up.  You can do that.  Is there a video of this?  Uh, yeah, I think so.  Video where it didn't happen.  Yeah.  Video where it didn't happen.  I know those guys anyway, the Double Crane Brothers. 
[01:02:00]  That's not as impressive.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, this stinks.  We'll try to find that video.  Thank you.  It's not good.  Big J.  So those are the two big GoPro videos.  That's a good one.  Although you got one on the list today there, Sam.  Yeah, this one's crazy too.  Man, bass jumps out of a ski lift.  What's the big deal with that?  Well, he's in a ski lift and then he jumps out of it.  Well.  Yeah, that's what these guys do, these bass jumpers.  That seems like a big deal to me.  And now the, uh, the cops are trying to find him.  What ski lift is this? 
[01:02:30]  Um.  It's a gondola, actually.  Yeah, it's not really a ski lift.  It's a cable car.  Yeah.  We filmed Nighthawks in that.  Yeah.  Nighthawks.  Yeah, Roosevelt Island.  Yes.  Do they know where this is?  The Alps.  Man continues to evade police after an illegal bass jump from ski lift.  That's a man?  That's a woman, right?  No, this isn't the woman in the drums.  Uh.  That's lovely.  How many times has Jimmy said that?  Yeah.  It's a GoPro, so he's looking at his, uh, chick right there. 
[01:03:00]  I would assume that's his chick.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, his chick.  Well, let's see it real fast.  Yeah.  Good.  Let her rip.  And they also, they, apparently they caused $10,000 in damage to the gondola.  Oh.  Prying the door open?  Prying the door open.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm sure there's a safety thing in place that you can't just open the fucking door.  Prying the door out is $10,000.  I would be freaked out just in a gondola.  I would hate it.  With the door open.  Right?  Who strung that cable?  Go fuck yourself.  Exactly.  Nice day.  Yeah, me too.  All right.  He opens up the gondola. 
[01:03:30]  It's a little windy out there.  That is high up.  That really is very high up.  Man.  I wouldn't want to be in the gondola with the door closed.  That would fucking horrify me.  If that falls, you're in deep shit.  This is extremely high.  He pried open the door.  He's trying to get outside because he's got to squeeze through a tiny spot.  Why is the gondola stopped at that point?  Is it?  I don't know if it actually is or if it's just moving slow.  You ready to do this?  Should we do this? 
[01:04:00]  No, you shouldn't.  He's outside the gondola.  Wow.  This chick is still inside with her GoPro.  He's got to be 50 feet near.  One.  There we go.  Shit.  A little plummeting.  He pulls his shoe.  Adrenaline junkies.  That's crazy. 
[01:04:30]  Still way the fuck up there.  How high do you think that was?  2,000 feet?  I don't know.  It looked extremely high.  And he was doing this to honor his friend who jumped off a cliff in Italy and whose chute  didn't open.  How is he?  He's dead now.  Oh, okay.  Did his girl jump out too?  No.  Hell no.  She gets to the other side and goes, I don't know.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know.  No, there's something must have happened to him. 
[01:05:00]  Hey, where is that guy?  You got me by the short and curlies.  I turned around.  He was gone.  The pace jumping is a lot easier than those guys hanging off the eye beams, by the way.  Yes.  Parachute.  Exactly.  These guys, for the most part, know what they're fucking doing.  And now he's going in for the landing.  Right into the snow, all fluffy.  Poof.  But I would never base jump full of trees.  Well, he knows where he's landing.  No, they know how to steer their shit. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Those things steer pretty good.  Now he's got to get the fuck out of there before the coppers show up.  Oh, he's in the middle of nowhere, though.  Yeah, that's true.  There's no one around.  How much longer on the video?  Do we get the...  We don't get her perspective?  No.  All right, sir.  We got it.  You did it.  People jump out of planes.  Very exciting.  He's very excited.  Yeah, I know, but he's acting like he fucking...  That's true.  I watched the Felix Baumgarten one again.  Yeah.  You see that GoPro video?  Yeah.  That's pretty good. 
[01:06:00]  Did you guys...  Did you see that?  Which one?  When he starts spinning.  Go to the fucking...  Because it's a new video of the GoPro of Felix Baumgarten.  The altitude record guy.  Yeah, there's a YouTube video of him jumping, and there's been other ones, but this one  is crystal fucking clear.  Yeah, from his GoPro cam.  Is that the newer one that's out?  It kind of looks like it.  Where this is the record jumping.  GoPros were mounted on the outside of this. 
[01:06:30]  They show the old oxygen hose.  That's inside the very technical gondola.  Oh my gosh.  He steps out.  He's at 100...  I wish you could see what I could see.  Wish I could see.  You could see what I could see.  You know what I'm trying to get?  I'm really high.  I'm just trying to get a Neil Armstrong moment.  Yeah, it's not a good quote.  Sorry. 
[01:07:00]  I'm coming home.  You're unimpressed?  Not yet.  I'm coming home now.  He salutes.  Just jumps.  Shit has...  Wouldn't you think you're not going to land on Earth?  Yeah.  What is that small?  Watch when he jumps.  You can see the perspective.  The curvature changes.  Oh my God.  That's from 120,000 feet.  Fuck that.  That's pretty cool, man.  But if they show the GoPro...  You see the GoPro mounted?  You just see space above his head.  Right.  There's the GoPro angle.  I've never seen this before.  This dumb balloon.  Look at the curvature of the Earth.  Wow.  Oh, wow. 
[01:07:30]  That's really cool.  All right.  We're going to put all this shit on our Facebook page.  And it looks like he's floating.  Yeah.  But from the other angle, it looked like he was falling down at an amazing rate, too.  He broke the speed of sound.  He broke the speed record.  Look at...  Didn't he start spinning?  Yes.  At one point, he does.  Right.  Because this looks like he's not spinning.  It looks like he's floating.  Right.  But he is a plummeting motherfucker.  They might have slowed this down for a fact, though.  No, no.  That's the way Kittenger said when he first jumped, he thought he wasn't falling.  Really?  And he had to look at the balloon above him and see how much distance he was making. 
[01:08:00]  Really?  Yeah.  It's an optical illusion.  He's falling quick.  How scary would that be if you jumped out and you're like, oh, no, I'm not falling?  Horrible.  I'm just in orbit.  Just as scary.  Oh, my God.  With the air that thin, you don't have that resistance on you where it's going, and you  don't have any real perspective.  He is absolutely falling here.  Trust your devices.  Yeah.  That's it.  But...  He's...  Yeah.  Now he's spinning.  But they show you, like...  That's beautiful, actually.  Yeah, you can see spaces on his left.  I'll fucking say it.  That's fucking beautiful. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, now he's starting to spin a little bit.  You can hear the wind picking up.  Yeah.  I'd be so anxious to get back to Earth.  Yeah.  What's taking so long?  Why?  He falls for five minutes.  Oh.  That seems like a terrible way to spend five minutes.  He starts spinning and sin.  Yeah, there he goes.  Now he's spinning.  650 miles an hour.  He starts saying he might pass out.  Right.  Now he's spinning like a mofo.  I guess the air.  Like a mofo.  Oh, that would make me so fucking sick. 
[01:09:00]  He's looking back up at his feet.  You see the...  Oh.  Gee.  They don't even know what he says.  Is he headfirst falling now?  Yes.  That's because he wanted to break their speed record.  Oh.  Right.  He got up to 800 miles an hour, I think.  But look at his feet.  When you look back up and see his feet, you can see how fast he's really falling.  And now it's just completely out of control.  Everything is spinning like a mofo.  Oh, I have to fall on speed?  Wow.  For a long time.  I'm in a violent spin.  I feel like I have to pass out.  I feel like I have to pass out.  Right. 
[01:09:30]  Do they have it all the way to the ground?  This thing?  Yeah.  It takes...  Now he's right now...  Now he's at 64,000 feet.  How'd he straighten himself out?  How'd he do that?  By putting his arms out?  Yeah.  I guess you need a little bit of wind.  You need some air to get resistance to straighten yourself out before the air thickens up.  You're fucked.  And his airspeed's slowing down to like 340.  He's still in space, though.  Right.  I think if I was spinning like that, I would just say, ah, fuck. 
[01:10:00]  Oh, well.  I failed, Ted.  I'm done.  This ain't gonna work.  Right.  Yeah.  225.  Wow.  You really do slow down.  Now he's at 140.  Like, that was a...  Really stable.  You fall in three and a half minutes.  Oh, okay.  They cut it down.  What a relief.  Right.  When you're out of space.  Four minutes free fall.  Four minutes free fall.  That's a long time.  Yeah.  The fall.  I hated his quote.  I'm coming home.  And he salutes.  I'm coming home.  Ready for...  Ready for duty.  Right. 
[01:10:30]  Now the parachute's out.  Reporting for duty.  That was a...  Shoot.  Parachute deployed.  I'm really tough.  Really tough.  You fell.  Yeah.  We're so proud of you.  And that...  That voice is Joe Kittinger.  Right.  I couldn't have done it.  You better myself.  You couldn't have, you old fuck.  That's cool.  I didn't see this angle yet.  Yeah, he did it.  The GoPro.  Kittinger did it in the 50s.  There he goes.  Fancy shit.  And there he hits the ground.  Wow.  That's got to be an amazing feeling. 
[01:11:00]  Nice GoPro.  Nice stand-up landing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Brad in Ohio.  Brad.  Brad.  Hey, I got a question for you guys.  Sure, we'll have answers.  Yes, Brad.  Do you realize you are on the radio and we can see these videos?  Yeah, we're doing this for ourselves and you're being extremely...  You're really nosy.  You're rude.  Exactly.  Mind your beeswax.  Mind your business.  Don't you worry about what we do.  Yeah, stop trying to get in.  I think you forgot the whole part where people are listening.  No, we don't care, actually. 
[01:11:30]  We were doing that for ourselves because it's pretty amazing to watch.  It's pretty cool.  Because we were voted show that it relays messages best to the listeners' ears.  Four years in a row, yes.  Four years.  Nice.  Yes.  Is it eaves or eavesdropping?  Eaves.  Eaves.  Eaves.  You're eavesdropping, sir.  Yeah.  That's not polite.  Stop eavesdropping.  Eavesdropping is what happens when you pick up E-Rock.  You just drop it with ease.  All right, boy.  All right.  All right.  Go watch it yourself.  Exactly. 
[01:12:00]  This has been a long haul for us, so guess what?  We're going to do some things for ourselves from time to time.  We're turning you on to these videos.  That's right.  Which are all up on O&A Show on Twitter and Facebook.  The whole fucking bunch of them that we did today.  There you go.  Shit, yeah.  We're practicing because eventually we're going to do TV.  That's what we're doing here.  We're just practicing.  That's right.  Jason in Ohio.  Jason.  Hey, recent convert.  Screw that vacation in AGT, motherfucker. 
[01:12:30]  Hey, have you guys on the opposite spectrum, have you seen these Indian kids down in Mumbai  or back there or whatever in the slums of India riding these trains?  They hang off.  Oh, yeah.  They end up getting killed every so often.  Yeah, poles come off.  I see them on LiveLeak a lot.  Those guys, you can just see the desperation that that's what they got to do down there  is hang off trains and jump back in when a pole comes by.  Looks fun.  Yeah.  We used to do that.  It was nuts.  I haven't seen any of these before.  Oh, yeah.  Is there a really good one? 
[01:13:00]  I've seen them on LiveLeak.  Right.  Invariably, on LiveLeak, there's always the mature symbol.  It says something bad happens.  Right.  But you'll see a kid, like, pop out, the pole will come by, and the pole will catch him,  and then he's gone.  It's just like, what the hell?  The train's taking off, and these guys are riding.  So as you're talking, they're dragging their feet along the platform, and they just hang  on the train.  And now they're tapping everything as they're leaning out and just tapping all the structures  that the train's flying by.  Yeah, it's fun.  They'll tap them.  And then, you know, they're not professional. 
[01:13:30]  Well, this is a slower train, because it's not an Amtrak, but it's still crazy.  This one guy is hanging on by one arm and just jumping up to hit all the structures  that the train is flying by.  With a fez hat.  With a fez hat.  He's wearing a fez hat.  I'll tell you why they're not going that fast, because his fez hat didn't fall off.  Right.  Yeah.  Whoa, he actually...  That's pretty great.  That's pretty cool.  He just started running.  Right.  You watch his videos, you just see the desperation that...  That's what they got to do down there, man.  All right, so we understand it's a desperate situation.  They don't need to ride trains.  Yeah, right.  Exactly.  These poor kids.  Yeah, figure something else out to do. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, when I was a rage, I'd walk.  Why is it desperation?  They're just stupid kids.  Yeah.  Bored.  They're bored.  Right.  Bored.  Another one with a fez hat.  A dumb fez hat.  Weepy at Nintendo.  Right, I hear you.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  These poor kids.  Yes, we get it.  They're desperate.  What do you mean they're desperate?  Maybe a little bored.  They're not desperate.  They're lollygagging on the train.  They don't have any fun thing.  They don't have Xbox One.  They did.  They'd fucking drop it out of the train by mistake. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Futsing around.  That's better than a roller coaster, right?  Yeah, this video's terrible.  Hey, are there any videos where, you know, it's not as pleasant?  Oh, yeah.  Or you might hit a fucking...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  Go to Chaotic.  You'll find one.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Yeah, go to Chaotic.  Look for a train.  I think the most insane thing is the wingsuits, though.  Oh, those things are pretty fucking cool.  The wingsuits.  Yeah.  Where they fly in between, like...  Like, right next to the mountain.  Boulders, whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't understand. 
[01:15:00]  Amazing.  How they figure out that they're going to be all right doing that.  Yeah.  You see the one guy where he's standing there and a guy in a wingsuit flies just over his  head?  Crazy.  I think we did the video on our show once.  It's got to be going well over 100 miles an hour.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he's able to figure out his wingsuit where he could just do a flyby.  Yeah.  He knows how close he's going to be.  He knows how fast he's falling.  Because you're still falling.  You know, you're not flying, really.  That shit's the craziest shit going, I think. 
[01:15:30]  The wingsuits.  Pretty cool indeed.  Right.  All right.  Mumbai train travel accident.  Oh, boy.  That one's got to be gruesome.  Yeah, but it might not.  Is it with the kids?  Maybe not.  It's YouTube.  With the kids on the outside?  Yeah, it's YouTube.  So it's not that bad.  Remember the guy getting electrocuted on top of the train?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Just burning.  Fire went through his head?  Yes.  Whenever something starts and fire leaves your head?  Yeah, it's never good.  You're in deep trouble. 
[01:16:00]  Well, your body's hot enough to push fire out of it.  You're fucked.  Andrew in Houston has an issue with the guy jumping from space.  Go ahead, Andrew.  All right, Andrew.  What's your issue?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I mean, it was pretty sweet.  But the curvature of the Earth is from the camera itself.  It's not from the actual curvature of the Earth.  Got a little live fish action in his camera?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's from Neil deGrasse Tyson, who I know you guys had on.  Oh, did he say that? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, he explained it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  He explained that it's not the curvature of the Earth?  Yeah.  He's just not high enough to see the curvature of the Earth.  He's still fucking really high, though.  You'd see a little bit of it.  Yeah.  And then you could see the curvature of the Earth on the horizon if you're out on the ocean.  But only with that fish island.  No.  It's talking about his eyes.  With his eyeballs.  He's talking about his eyeballs.  You can see a little bit of the pie.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  But it's not as drastic as that video makes it out to be, I guess.  Thanks, Neil.  Thanks, Neil, for buzzkilling. 
[01:17:00]  The fucking guy is extremely high, though.  What the fuck?  Yeah.  Give him some credit.  Why do we all have to shit on stuff?  We just shit on things.  We love it.  We just shit on society.  We just shit on everything.  Can't we just admit that it's pretty impressive that he jumped from space?  Because we're horrible.  Yeah.  All right.  We got food.  We're going to take a little break here.  Nice.  Get into some stuff.  Some stuff.  Some things.  Yeah.  We got a lot of stuff to get into next, so stay there.

[01:23:00]  I was driving home and I was behind a bus.  You know, like the bus has an automatic sign.  9-1-1, call police.  I call 9-1-1.  9-1-1, what is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound and I'm behind the bus and the sign says call 9-1-1.  I thought it was a stolen bus.  I didn't know what was happening.  There could have been hostages.  I mean, we all saw that Keanu Reeves movie.  I'm on the phone with the 9-1-1 and this fucking dummy is, where are you now?  I said, I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th Avenue.  Okay, you're on, now where are you now?  I said, 48th Street. 
[01:23:30]  Where are you now?  49th Street.  And you said it's heading which way, sir?  Northbound.  It's the only way you can go on 10th Avenue.  We're so irritated with these dummies.  So we make the left on 57th Street.  We go down to 11th Avenue.  I go, look, he's making the left on 11th Avenue.  It's a yellow light, so the bus slows down and then shoots through the light and leaves  me at the red light.  I knew that the bus did that on purpose.  I'm like, this guy knows I'm behind him.  Now we're going southbound again.  So I called back.  No one way, it's emergency.  So I just called and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think.  No one is doing it.  How long does it take to get a squad car on fucking 11th Avenue? 
[01:24:00]  So I pull up next to it, and it's really dark on the bus.  And you see there's a black dude.  I'm on the phone.  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy.  And he's just a black dude, but he's not dressed like a bus driver.  And I know that he's stealing this bus.  I'm northbound now, and he's behind me.  And he's like, what street?  I'm like, now we're passing 40th Street.  The woman was like, where was he before?  10th and 11th, but then he came down 11th, and now we're going up 10th.  He's probably going to turn it off.  You guys are going to lose him.  Follow him fucking side.  You keep saying 10th and 11th, but 10th and 11th are in parallel.  What street and 11th?  I know, he was on 10th, and then he went down 11th. 
[01:24:30]  So then I was just like, fuck this shit.  And I drive away, and he pulls away slowly and starts to drive.  And I'm like, you know what?  Forget it.  You know what?  Thank you.  He just turned it off.  He just turned it off.  Okay.  We lost him, and he probably turned into the bus depot.  The OPM show is better on SiriusXX.  I want to be.  Sledgehammer.  Nice. 
[01:25:00]  Peter Gabriel, 64 years old.  It's a D.  Hammer.  Dead.  64, huh?  Chuck Yeager.  Chuck Yeager's 91.  91.  I didn't know he was still alive.  Chuck Yeager.  Good old Chuck Yeager's 91.  What is he known for?  You first got a blast through the sound barrier.  Huh? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, Yeager Meister.  I thought I knew I knew the guy.  Yeah.  The inventor of the Yeager Meister is 91 today.  Chuck Yeager.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thanks for that.  He took his little rocket plane.  Right.  Glamorous Glenis.  Right.  And blasted through the old sound barrier.  Damn.  Yeah.  That's pretty impressive.  And then when he did it, he couldn't even fucking be like, woohoo, look what I did, because 
[01:26:00]  it was a top secret kind of a thing, because we were, you know, Russians.  We were fighting the Ruskies.  The Ruskies.  It was just after World War II.  Right.  But people already knew, yeah, those Ruskies are going to be a problem.  Right.  So we got to do some experimenting.  Yeah.  But he was also an experimental pilot, test pilot, his own pilot, you know, just fucking  flying around.  And even as an old guy, like, I think in his 80s or something.  He was still flying, right?  He was around the world.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Guy's a real man's man, as they say. 
[01:26:30]  Featured in the Right Stuff movie, which is very fucking good movie.  That's a terrific movie.  Yeah.  And then our pal Jerry Springer is claiming to be 70 today.  Claiming.  Yeah.  We had our doubts when that number came across our transom this morning.  We talked to him only a few weeks ago, and I think he did.  He told us he was in his 70s.  In his 70s.  So, I don't know.  There might be a little, uh...  You mean to tell me when we were talking to him, he was in his 60s? 
[01:27:00]  No way.  No fucking way.  I'm not buying that one.  And then we lost a legend overnight.  Huh?  Mr. Not Overnight.  I guess it's a little older now.  Sid Caesar.  Oh, Sid Caesar.  Comedy legend.  How old was he?  91.  91.  Right.  Goddamn.  What was he known for?  The salad.  Oh, right.  Thank you, Kenny.  Kenny, again, blurting out a factoid.  So, the guy that invented the Caesar salad... 
[01:27:30]  Yes.  ...is dead at the age of 91.  Thank you, Kenny.  I appreciate it.  Sid Caesar.  Your show of shows back in the early days of television.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, if you're a fan of the movie Grease, you might remember him as the gym teacher.  Oh, that's right.  Who told John Travolta, running, long distance running.  That was Sid Caesar.  Good old Sid Caesar.  Yes.  The writers he had on that show were fucking...  Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks.  Right.  Um...  Mel Brooks wrote for Sid Caesar. 
[01:28:00]  That's pretty crazy.  Larry Gelbart, who I think was one of the creators of MASH.  Right.  Um...  And there was a couple...  He had some fucking...  Woody Allen wrote for him.  He had some high-powered writers.  The Golden Age.  Yeah.  Yes.  Golden Age of, uh, comedy.  Comedy.  Comedy.  Television.  Yeah, those guys, they didn't even know.  There was no fucking, um...  No instruction book.  No prose on, here's what you do for television.  Right.  They had no fucking clue.  Like, what?  What is this television thing? 
[01:28:30]  All right, we'll give it a whirl.  And they get on there, write some stuff, act out, uh, uh, bits, and fucking just get up  there and talk.  I was watching yesterday Dick Cabot.  Like, the old school talk shows.  And he was, uh, it was John Lennon's second appearance.  Whoa.  And Cabot opens up his monologue, and he's kind of unprepared.  Like, he gets some laughs.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, he's got John and Yoko coming out.  But what he's doing during his monologue is he auctions off his tie to the audience.  He just decides to auction off his fucking tie. 
[01:29:00]  And I thought that was so great that there was that breathing room and that freedom to  do that.  Yeah.  And not this obsession.  Right.  Where every second has to matter.  Yeah, every moment, every story out.  You're going, quick break!  And it was like fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  Set up joke.  Set up joke.  Set up joke.  It was more natural and comfortable.  Mm-hmm.  Arsenio Hall was on, uh, Piers Morgan last night.  I watched for a total of ten seconds.  Two people that aren't going to have a show.  Ten seconds I watched.  Yeah.  But, uh, Arsenio Hall was talking about Johnny Carson talking to, uh, Richard Pryor about 
[01:29:30]  the N-word and how Johnny Carson actually said the word.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then I went on YouTube to try to find this fucking discussion.  I couldn't find it.  Maybe you can, Sam.  Yo, my nigga.  Yeah.  But I...  He was...  He was so black.  How black was he?  Yeah, he said the...  I saw that recently, actually.  Yeah?  Yes, uh, the problem with the word...  There's a couple of really great clips.  There's one clip of Pryor on there with that fucking line I love so much where he's like,  I knew it was time to stop drinking, when the bartenders would go, we got no more liquor. 
[01:30:00]  Do you remember that one?  Right.  But it's his delivery of that is so frantic and great.  Yeah, yeah.  It might be that clip, um, or it might be another one where he, Carson talks about the  word, use the word liquor.  And then, uh, they had the N-word discussion again on CNN last night with that Aaron Burnett.  What conclusions they come to?  Well, Paula Deen...  Can we not use it still?  Oh, God.  Paula Deen...  I know.  Paula Deen's coming back, and she's got a massive fucking deal, man.  Good.  There you go. 
[01:30:30]  She's gonna be a very rich lady again.  So they're discussing the whole N-word controversy with a black talk show host, and then there  was a white woman on there, you know, and the white woman was making our fucking point,  basically saying, you know, Jay-Z's new song or a recent song has the word nine times  within a minute.  And if it doesn't, it shouldn't.  I mean, it should.  It should.  I was like, wait a minute.  And then Aaron Burnett went with the angle with the black talk show host that that's okay  because he's black. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, right.  I don't understand that.  Exactly.  Everyone wants equality as long as they can be separate.  Everyone figures out a way to why what they say is okay, but what you say isn't.  Right, because this white woman was saying, you know, this is what Jay-Z does, and Aaron  Burnett, the black talk show host, couldn't believe she would say that.  Like, well, he could do it because he's black.  She might as well have said it that way.  I've never seen a group of people that want to be known and respected and everything for 
[01:31:30]  anything but their race concentrate so much on their race.  It's an astounding thing.  It's an amazing paradox, isn't it?  Yeah.  I don't really feel like I want to use the word.  I'm just saying that.  But I think it's kind of ludicrous to have that reasoning about it.  It's become my new, like, yelling fuck.  It's become your new and. 
[01:32:00]  Pop music.  I'm playing Call of Duty.  I will just blurt it.  I will just yell it out.  Yeah.  Not when I have the headset on.  Mike, you know, I'm not yelling it into the actual game room, but I'll yell it out just  as an expletive.  And, you know, I mean, pop music just has it all over the fucking place.  And I think it takes the power away from the word.  I really do.  There's no.  I heard about this.  Okay.  So Nicki Minaj has a song that has the word a lot. 
[01:32:30]  Looking at niggas, it's called.  Whoa.  I actually like that name.  Is it about people who are jealous of her?  I get.  And looking at her.  Oh, it is.  Okay.  I figured that there was a little more to it than just the obvious look.  Did you?  Yeah, I was hoping there was something more to that.  So explain why this word has so much power if it's thrown around like this in a pop song.  It doesn't.  And I don't care if it's E-R or, you know.  Well, let's hear like the first word.  Well, when you say it like this, well, at least say the A at the end. 
[01:33:00]  Say nigger, that's okay.  Yeah, you know who you sound like?  A plantation owner.  Yeah, yeah.  That's how they said it.  Oh, my God.  Go back to the South.  Hey, look, my niggas.  They didn't say it with E-R at the end.  That's a Southern accent where I say it.  And it's not okay because if white people say it that way, there's problems.  Yeah.  Let's give it like.  It's, it's, this whole argument is ridiculous.  Let's give it 10 seconds.  But rappers aren't the ones, sorry, rappers aren't the ones who are, who are saying no  one should say it.  You know what I mean?  Rappers are saying it and, you know.  Right.  So I don't mind them doing it. 
[01:33:30]  Or anyone doing it.  Anything?  Hold on.  Can you go back?  It didn't say the name of her song, did it?  No.  It said Lookin' Ass.  Lookin' Ass.  Lookin' Ass.  Right.  It doesn't even say niggas on the radio.  Oh, okay.  All I know is there should be no reason.  Look at John Niggas.  All I know is there should be no reason.  Niggas.  All I know is there should be, all I know.  Look at John Niggas.  All I know is there should be no reason.  All I know is there should be no reason.  Niggas.  They just want to say the word now in every song. 
[01:34:00]  They're doing the same thing.  They're just like, because you're not supposed to say it.  They're just.  Five.  Yeah.  They're using it.  Five times in the first 30 seconds.  No, hip-hop has lately been going out of their way.  Out of their way.  Of course.  Look at it as much as humanly possible.  Well, they saw how.  My nigga, my nigga.  Right.  Exactly.  My motherfuckin' nigga.  They saw how popular that got.  And this is just a response to all that.  Yeah.  That's fucking.  And this word still has power.  Why?  Like they almost.  When it's thrown around like this.  Get the fuck out of here.  Artificial.  They want their song to be brought up on CNN by Eric Latt.  Right.  This song contains the N-word. 
[01:34:30]  Yes.  No young black guy is offended at this.  They're just enjoying it.  Yes, Kelly.  Not at all.  That word is an award-winning word.  Why?  Oh, no.  This example.  Washington won the Academy Award for Best Actor for using that word in Training Day.  Well, they would probably say that that was an Academy Award winning a performance that  had that word in it.  That's not why they gave it to him.  Just best use of the word in a leading role.  It just happens.  You did this on the Amy Schumer show.  It's not a good argument. 
[01:35:00]  It makes no sense.  No, because it doesn't take place.  I figured I mentioned it here also because it's very poignant.  It sure is.  By poignant, you mean tedious.  I like Kenny and his traveling does.  I hate Kenny.  Here's why.  Because he's got almost fancy fucking fancy mom jeans and sneakers.  I don't like it.  Fancy mom jeans.  This is storm attire.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Tomorrow we'll be traveling attire.  Oh, okay.  Storm attire.  Where are you going?  We're going to Atlantic City tomorrow.  Remember?  We've got two out of three sold out shows. 
[01:35:30]  So whoever wants to go Saturday to the late show, it's going to be a hell of a time.  I think that might be the show I'm going to.  Are you the late show?  Good.  Probably, yeah.  G.H. will be there.  I think it's Saturday, yeah.  Are you going to the late show?  I don't know.  Yeah, I'll be there.  I'll be there on the Saturday.  And save money to buy t-shirts.  Nice.  Oh, nice.  Keep going, Sam.  I'm counting the seven.  Nick.  Look at y'all niggas. 
[01:36:00]  Look at y'all.  Look at y'all niggas.  I like how she says it.  I like how she says it.  They supposed to zoom in on her mouth saying it?  Oh, yeah.  Look at y'all smoking ass niggas after every poor niggas start choking ass niggas.  You know what?  Nigga, nigga.  Ha, ha, ha.  Come on.  Look at y'all bitch ass niggas.  Stop lying on your dick ass niggas.  You know what?  Nigga, nigga.  What's she talking to?  General.  Look at y'all looking ass niggas.  Stop looking at my ass ass niggas.  Now.  Look at y'all lying ass niggas talking about his pay door for this fine ass lying ass niggas. 
[01:36:30]  Bunch of non-mogul ass niggas fronting like they got a plan for this mobile ass niggas.  This is hilarious.  Non-mogul ass niggas.  How great is that?  I love this song.  Non-mogul ass niggas.  That's hilarious.  You never want to be called a non-mogul ass niggas.  You're broke.  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.  25 times so far, I think.  Damn.  I think I missed one or two in there.  But rappers are doing the same thing that, you know, comics or anybody else that we do. 
[01:37:00]  Holding up something that you're saying don't say and going, fuck you.  I'm going to say it.  Right.  It gets, they get very popular, these songs.  And they know, too.  It's almost like, like, they know that nobody's going to call them on it because everybody's  afraid to do it to the rap song.  Right.  No, you know who calls these guys on it?  This is, this is where Sharpton actually will, or Jesse Jackson, they go after rap, too.  Like, the black preachers go after them.  But no, it is.  It's a cry wolf.  It's a cry wolf thing.  Their agenda is so ridiculous and transparent that when they do have a cause that they, 
[01:37:30]  you know, oh, the children, we shouldn't have this word.  Everyone just goes, ah, shut up.  Well, that's what I mean, they're not afraid of it because the people that they need to  like the song don't care.  And they don't go after rap like they went after, like, Imus or something.  No.  Oh, hell no.  No.  Hell no.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  That's right.  Imus came up on the discussion last night.  Yeah.  She sounds like she's saying Nickus.  You like it?  Nickus.  Dude, non-mogul-ass niggers.  What a great line. 
[01:38:00]  That is funny.  I hate to be called that.  Oh, man.  Because it's not an arguable thing.  It's like, no, you're not a mogul.  Hey, Tonsils, how you doing?  Good.  Did you bring your strep throat in with you?  Yeah, what'd you do?  Oh, no, you gotta get your tonsils out?  Sal.  Yeah, I gotta get my tonsils out.  Who gets your tonsils out with you, 10?  I know.  I feel like a little bit.  What happened?  Why do you gotta get your tonsils out on this thing and age?  Jizzitis.  Oh, is it jizzitis?  I'm sorry.  No, it's fine.  Yeah, my girlfriend pretty much gave me that infection. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  I'm real sorry.  You at home couldn't see.  He made air quotes.  Yeah.  Your girlfriend gave you an infection?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, she had, like, the same thing, like, two weeks ago.  Too much making out, huh?  Yeah.  Too much man to girl kissing herself.  So, uh...  My girlfriend's dick had an infection.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It could happen, though.  Yeah, sure.  So, I went to the doctor and he was like...  Did he give you the news?  Oh, no.  Dr. Vinnie Boombats.  Did you want a second opinion? 
[01:39:00]  All right.  You're ugly, too.  I didn't think that one.  Sorry, Sal.  I apologize.  Didn't mean to interrupt.  So, uh...  So, he said, I get that infection, like, way too often per year.  He said, if you go to an ENT, they would immediately tell you, just the sheer size of your tonsils,  they would tell you to take them out of me.  You got large...  Are you a large tonsil gentleman?  Yes, I am.  They're swollen, because they keep getting poked at.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it is.  Yeah, they're going to beat by it like a fucking heavy bag.  One big fist with clear stuff on it. 
[01:39:30]  I don't think they take out tonsils anymore.  I know.  I thought there were other things that they do, yeah.  Because it's a motherfucker when you get older.  Yeah, he said back in the day, if you had, like, one little issue with it, they would  take them out immediately.  Right.  But then they realized that it's not the best thing to do.  Yeah, and it's...  They're just tougher, I think, when you get older, so it's a motherfucker.  Yeah.  There's also a hell of a blood flow supply going of tonsils, so when they take them out,  it's, you know, you got to cap that shit off. 
[01:40:00]  Do you have your tonsils?  Be careful, yeah.  Do you help you?  I got mine.  Do you?  I do.  No, my adenoids and tonsils were both taken out.  You're lying.  No, I swear to God.  Oh.  Adenoids, I didn't know exactly what they were, but my tonsils have been out for many,  many years.  Must be brains.  How old were you?  How old were you, Jim?  I was very young. 
[01:40:30]  I want to say 13 or 12.  Aw.  I don't remember...  In the hospital.  Yeah.  That's when you're supposed to get them out, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you, 30?  Lots of ice cream.  In the hospital, oh, I'm a tonsils, oh, I need ice cream.  Yeah.  Just throw it on my back.  Yeah.  Warm it up.  Throw it on my back.  And he also said it would help with my sleep apnea, like my snoring.  Yes.  Oh, I am.  Because I stop breathing a lot.  No one has sleep apnea.  That's true.  Sure.  No.  Sleep apnea is another made-up shit fucking thing.  That's a bold statement. 
[01:41:00]  So sick of hearing about everyone's sleep apnea.  No, I'm okay with it, but I just annoy everyone that I sleep with.  Yeah.  I snore really fucking loud.  Look at the gentleman.  Then fucking roll over.  Everyone I sleep with.  Everyone I sleep with.  Look at that.  Oh.  Man, woman, and child.  All them chicks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little jiggle over here.  Girls, just talk amongst yourselves about how hard it is.  I was making a dumb joke.  I was just making a dumb joke.  Of course it's real. 
[01:41:30]  When are you scheduled to go, as they say, under the knife?  He gave me a referral, so as soon as I'm all healed up over here, I can go and get him taken out.  Nice.  What do they use these days?  Is it like a little, like almost wire cutter looking thing?  From what I understand, it's like a hollowed out tube that has like a wire.  Yeah, yeah.  On the inside, and they just literally just put the wire over the thing, and they just pull.  It's like Luca Brasi's neck.  Yeah, exactly.  They fucking are.  What?  It's a Sicilian necktie for the consoles.  Are you unconscious?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  Why?  I think you are.  Why would they put you out for that? 
[01:42:00]  I think you are.  Why would they put you out for that?  What do you think?  You got a thing in your mouth.  They do eye surgery when you're not under.  I guess you do things in your mouth.  I think you are.  They got to like fucking.  Right.  There's no blood with the eye surgery.  That's pretty crazy.  Will it improve your gag reflex?  Yeah, hopefully.  Oh, man.  Big fucking baloney right there in your throat.  Nice.  Let's get back to Nicki Minaj.  Nicki Minaj.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Yeah, whatever.  Good luck, Sal.  Loving this fucking song right here.  Non-tonsil-ass nigga.  Yeah.  Non-tonsil-ass nigga. 
[01:42:30]  Perfectly coiffed beard, nigga.  Travel clothes even though it ain't travel day, nigga.  Mom jeans, nigga.  Big, dumb, terrible example given, nigga.  Nigga, look at y'all can't give a job.  So you're plotting how to rob ass niggas.  I ain't got a check for y'all, but if I'm a check for y'all, I'ma need a check for y'all, niggas.  I don't want sex, give a fuck about your ex, and I don't even want to text from y'all niggas.  I'm raping you niggas.  Look at this pink with the what the fuck I get for you, niggas. 
[01:43:00]  They are 13 minutes.  Niggas, with my time for me, Clinton, I'm billing these niggas.  Nice.  Did she say I'm raping these niggas?  Yes, she did.  Cool, alright.  Holy shit, this is a great song.  She's whored.  I love it.  She's definitely whored.  She said she's Clinton because she's billing these n-words.  She looks really hot in this video, too.  Yeah, she looks fucking sexy.  She looks fucking amazing in this video.  Yeah.  She's a very good looking woman.  I have a feeling she's going to really ramp up the saying of the word.  You think it's...  I haven't heard this, but I feel like it's out of control. 
[01:43:30]  She's already fucking done a pretty good job.  No, I think it gets way worse.  Go ahead.  This is great.  Wow.  Big ass.  Fuck, is she juicy now, badass?  She's awesome.  Look at y'all sharing one bottle in the club, one bottle full of pub-ass niggas.  Look at y'all not having game-ass niggas.  Y'all niggas share chain-ass niggas. 
[01:44:00]  They cup in the hand-ass niggas in the club with a credit card-share-m-ass niggas.  No dick in the pants-ass niggas.  I'll be damned if I fuck a non-man-ass niggas.  Oh, man.  I will never fuck a non-man-ass niggas.  I will never lie, even if that niggas flew me and my bitches all the way out to Dubai.  Pussy, you tried.  Pussy-ass niggas, you lied.  Pussy-ass niggas, you high.  Bitch, I'm me.  100 on the wrist, I ski.  I'm on the wall, I ski.  Fuck, who's me?  Look at you fake dope dealers, no real niggas that be moving weight in them villas.  Talking about keys, say it's keys in the van, but he really moved grams and he split it with his man. 
[01:44:30]  She's just standing there, like, on a shoreline doing this is great.  She needs a real man, nigga.  Yeah.  That's right.  Yeah.  She would hate the way I fuck.  Oh, man.  You don't think she'd be impressed?  No.  This is violent.  She's got guns.  She's got two AR-15.  She's doing everything.  But look at the titties move when she fires the gun.  Doing everything that could get you criticized is great. 
[01:45:00]  As they don't like in music videos these days.  Yep, good for her.  Oh, shit.  Good for fucking niggas.  She ain't fucking around.  Shooting niggas rape.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Where's the fucking, come on, white people?  Yeah.  Line up and criticize white people.  Oh, you won't.  Fuck you.  You won't hear that.  Good for her.  What's going to be the radio edit?  Lion-ass hitters.  Yeah, hitters.  Lion-ass hitters.  I'll tape you.  Lion-ass hitters.  No, mogul-ass hitters.  Rick Ross did a song where the lyric is literally that he put a drug in a girl's 
[01:45:30]  drink and she didn't remember it going back to his house when he had sex with her.  Oh.  And it was kind of like a few people were like, that's wrong.  And he was like, all right, yeah, no, I didn't mean rape.  And then it just went away.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  You're free to go.  Free to go about your business.  I want to know what the edit is because that song is too cool not to get some play.  Oh, it's going to get a lot of play.  Wow.  Like that, though?  No.  No.  Of course not.  No.  So I wonder how they're going to change it up.  Because the other song works with the edit.  The hitters? 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, it does work.  I hear it in the bathroom from time to time.  That hits one in the bathroom.  It actually works.  Let's try it.  Let's see if they'll say the house next door to me been sold to hitters.  Yeah, let's see if that's as it played on radio.  I bet they wouldn't play it still.  Of course they wouldn't because of what it means.  Exactly.  Let's talk to Rexer.  He wants in on this Nicky Minaj.  Rexer, North Carolina.  What's up?  Hey, hey, morning to you.  How are you?  All right, brother.  How's the snow?  Yeah, Rick. 
[01:46:30]  Or just continue talking while I make believe we actually have a connection.  Go ahead, buddy.  Yeah, let's see how this goes off when Ellen brings her little British chicks on to repeat  Nicki Minaj's song.  What did he say?  Ellen has those little chubby British girls come on and do Nicki Minaj songs.  Oh, really?  Because before this, Nicki Minaj kind of drifted away from hardcore rap and doing pop songs.  Yeah, those little English girls.  They did also, too, when they sang their first song that a lot of people didn't agree with 
[01:47:00]  it because they thought it was cute that little girls were singing it, but do they really  know what they're singing about?  No.  I mean, one of the lyrics is, he might sound dope.  Yeah.  And they were just like...  But they don't know.  They don't know.  They're adorable.  Who cares?  Right.  Yeah.  Well, regardless, they're the only white people to get away with it.  And it's Ellen's show.  Right.  Everyone loves Ellen.  It's fun.  She's hosting the Oscars.  She's an American treasure.  Is she hosting the Oscars?  Yeah.  We've got to add her to that list.  She is an American treasure.  We've got to add her to that list, for sure.  National treasure, that woman. 
[01:47:30]  She'll do great.  And I hope she does have those little kids come on and sing this song.  I didn't even know she was doing that bit.  Oh, yeah.  She's always got that little British girl singing.  Yeah.  All right.  I love that song.  It's very catchy.  Yeah.  She's fucking super sexy in there.  There's just something about those songs that are very catchy.  Oh, Drake, Drake, by the way, fucking bashed that fucking Fruity McLemore.  Oh, yes.  That was some whack-ass shit.  Good.  Whack as fuck.  What calls McLemore's Grammy apology? 
[01:48:00]  Whack as fuck.  That was great.  What does that mean?  I called it whack as fuck first, I think.  Yeah.  You did.  Yes, you did.  Yes, I did.  McLemore's a douche.  He is a fucking asshole.  So disingenuous.  A groveling dick bag.  Exactly.  Yo, I don't like to use that word.  Like, shut up.  Yeah.  Shut your mouth.  He goes, to put it bluntly, Drake thought,  that shit was whack as fuck.  And the quote is,  I was like, you won.  Why are you posting your text message?  Just chill. 
[01:48:30]  Take your W,  and if you feel like you didn't deserve it,  go get better.  Make better music.  Good for Drake.  And then he wrote,  and then he was quoted saying,  it felt cheap.  It didn't feel genuine.  Right.  Why do that?  Why feel guilt?  You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won?  Nope.  Good for Drake.  Embarrassing.  It's not embarrassing to be that guilty white guy.  That's why he's not likable,  because it's all bullshit.  Macklemore.  He's a liar.  That's good choruses, though.  No.  I don't like his choruses.  Not even him.  Well, yeah, but.  Fuck him. 
[01:49:00]  This is the moment.  That's a good chorus.  Drake was nominated for that award, too.  The best rap,  and he was probably sitting there like,  who the fuck is this taking this award?  Fuck.  What?  Yeah, he should have went out,  and Drake is,  what's his big song?  Well, the song that we've listened to is,  I love it.  Started from the bottom.  From the bottom,  but he had like one of the biggest years in rap,  this last, 2013.  He's like,  untouchable right now.  Is he bigger than Pitbull?  Pitbull sucks.  No, Pitbull's right up there still. 
[01:49:30]  Pitbull is terrible.  He's not even a rapper.  Pitbull rules.  He just makes shitty pop music.  He's horrible.  You gotta give respect to a guy that's 50  and still rapping.  He is an old man, isn't he?  How old is he really?  I don't know.  He looks so old.  He does.  So falsely,  he's not even that old.  Come on,  give me a Pitbull song.  Pitbull.  Pitbull rules.  Damn it.  Oh, this is a lie.  He says he's 33.  He's not a little fucking way.  Are you looking at a 33-year-old there?  And Jerry Springer's 70.  Right.  Oh, God bless him. 
[01:50:00]  Come on.  Pitbull rules.  Bus driver's story is really great.  Pitbull doesn't rule at all.  That guy should have his fucking job.  Oh, which one do you mean?  What happened?  A bus driver had a problem with a student  on a school bus,  and the student decided...  Wait, you're saying student very strangely.  Oh, am I?  Yes.  I couldn't be.  I'm picking up on something here.  Exactly.  And the student thought it would be a good idea  to just get up,  go up to the bus driver  and punch him in the face a couple of times.  So he did,  and the bus driver starts defending himself, 
[01:50:30]  and the bus rolls very slowly into a car.  Right.  Like, into a car in a parking lot.  Well, did he just get up and not hit the brakes?  He didn't hit the brakes,  but he was being punched in the face.  While he was fighting, okay.  Yeah.  Why was he being punched in the face, though?  Because he told the kid  that there was a problem with his bus pass or something,  and the kid was, you know, mouthing off to him.  And the kid sat down in his seat,  thought about it,  gets up,  and wails the fucking driver in the face.  Starts punching him. 
[01:51:00]  So the driver gets up and grabs the kid  and starts, you know,  trying to fight back.  Here's the clip.  Every time these innocent teens defended themselves.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  Can you make a picture, sweetie?  I can't say.  You betcha.  Thank you.  I think it was very rude of the bus driver.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  And these little fucking pussy kids  don't even help the driver.  They just sit there and watch.  They don't want to get beat.  Watch.  Watch.  Ah.  You would jump up and help, you think?  At least fucking kick him in the face  as he walks by.  Yeah.  Something.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  Cheap shot.  Karate to karate.  Yeah.  At least kick him in the face.  It's called karate, Jerry.  All right.  Picked up at high school  and the driver is fired for fighting back.  Yeah, the driver got fired.  WISN 12 News Nick Boer reports from Kenosha  the entire fight was captured on video.  Well, that's a hell of a fight going down.  The driver was making his usual pickup  of about 30 kids here at Kenosha.  He shot Rick Moranis.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Wow. 
[01:52:00]  The whole thing started  when the Kenosha Transit driver  told police he demanded the student's ID  for swearing and being disruptive in the past.  The 15-year-old boy goes past the driver  then walks back up,  calls him an expletive,  and starts punching the driver,  who retaliated,  getting up and punching the boy right back.  Wow.  While that's going on,  another camera shows his children  and starts shouting  as the bus begins to roll,  slowly running into a car,  shoving it aside,  and then hitting two parked pickups. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  That, what, four miles an hour?  According to the police report,  the 135-pound boy later admitted,  quote,  I was mad that he was going to suspend my bus pass,  so I got up and punched him in the face.  Okay.  The driver was later fired  by Kenosha Transit  for improper conduct while on duty,  failure to properly secure the vehicle  in having a preventable accident.  I think they fired him more  because the bus kept going.  That's what it was.  The boy's mother wanted the driver charged,  but prosecutors decided  the only one who would face charges 
[01:53:00]  is the boy.  Good.  They didn't show the video  of the initial punch, too.  Why did the mother want the,  you know, that's just,  that worthless thing  fell out of your cunt, lady.  It's your fault.  Yeah.  You're shitty at what you do.  Right.  You raised a fucking animal.  Yeah, it's that fucking,  that dumpster between your legs  dropped that little fucking monster out  who punched a bus driver in the face.  Punches a bus driver.  Sue yourself.  Could you imagine the kid,  like, if a kid punched the bus driver 
[01:53:30]  in the face when we were going to school?  Oh, God.  He would, first of all,  he'd be a legend.  Like, that would be one of those stories  that would be told years and years.  Of course.  No one did that shit.  But the kid's pretty brave  because the bus driver's an animal.  He's a big motherfucker.  Big motherfucker.  So he's pretty brave on his part.  But he's probably...  He's not brave.  There's no thought process  that goes into this kind of violence.  There's no thought of consequence.  It's the moment.  It's that fucking moment  where it's like,  This is the moment.  I have to hit someone. 
[01:54:00]  I have to walk up  and punch that person in the face  because they disrespected me.  No fucking thought.  And it's either punch them,  stab them,  or shoot them,  whatever it is.  Take their hat and repaint it.  That too.  And repaint it.  Oh, man.  Is that degrading?  The guy who has no good examples  who throws one in  paint their hat green  with purple felt paint?  Yeah.  But that's what it is.  There's no thought process  behind that.  He probably hasn't had  a whole lot of consequences 
[01:54:30]  in his upbringing.  Exactly.  Consequence is consequence.  As long as I'm rich.  But how is he supposed  to get anywhere  if they suspend his bus pass?  But what does this have to do  with Pitbull?  He's old as fuck.  Why are we talking about Pitbull?  Pitbull stinks.  Pitbull rules.  Those commercials rule.  What commercials?  Beer commercials.  You know who else  I think stinks?  Who?  Two Chains.  What?  I think Two Chains stinks.  What's he saying?  I don't know.  I think he's a hack.  How would you know? 
[01:55:00]  He comes out with the  Two Chains.  It's like,  oh, I get it.  Yeah, but his lyrics,  spell it out.  My name's Two Chains,  but I got a few.  It's so fucking stupid.  What's he saying?  I don't even know who he is.  Two Chains.  But what's stupid  about the whole thing  is a guy comes out  with Three Chains  and Two Chains is fucked.  No, I cleared that up already.  He said,  I'm Two Chains,  but I got a few.  Yeah, but then a guy  can go,  I got Three Chains  and I got a few.  Thank you.  Two Chains would come back  and I'm strong.  Remember this? 
[01:55:30]  Infinity plus one?  Infinity.  Infinity plus one.  Infinity plus one.  Now what are you going to do?  Look at the stupid  Two Chains  with his Two Chains.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's wearing  a leopard print jumpsuit.  Every rapper is out.  Yeah, but you know  why this is funnier?  Because he's in a boat  that's being pulled  by a car.  That is pretty good.  He's in a boat  on the road. 
[01:56:00]  Look at the angry  white cop  that's pulling him over.  The guy's like,  what the fuck?  The ceiling's missing.  The top's down  on the car  but he makes it sound cool.  Right?  Who agreed to play  the police officer  in this video?  Pull up to the scene  by my roof gone  When I leave the scene  but you pull gone  Oh shit,  they're pulling guns  on the cops?  Guns on the cops.  This is just not good.  Does anyone have a problem  with this video?  Why are they discussing 
[01:56:30]  this on CNN  instead of the stupid  N-word?  Because he's the man.  He's Two Chains.  This is not good.  It's not a good video.  It's not good.  But that's the point.  It's so absurdly bad  that it's good again.  But it's not a good rap.  No, but it's so bad  that it's good.  But it's not supposed  to be bad.  Yeah, it is.  Everybody knows  how bad it is.  But it's good.  Why don't they address  the violence  to police officers  in there?  Like if the news  wants to jump on  bad examples  of things like video games 
[01:57:00]  and want to do real shit  and shit,  why not look at that  and now personally  on a personal level  I think it's hilarious  and give it shit.  Right, right.  But when the press  has to jump on  every little thing  as examples of violence  and bad examples  for the children  and stuff.  They were just  they pulled a white cop  out of a car  two black gangsta  looking motherfuckers  and pulled guns  to his head  and they're cuffing him  on his knees.  Right.  Look, there's an old lady  dancing in a boat with him  with a hat that says 
[01:57:30]  fresh on it.  Is he a respected rapper?  Yeah.  Does that kid  oh, he's wearing  a little slugger t-shirt.  2 Chain's name  used to be Titty Boy.  No.  Then he changed his name.  Titty Boy  but then he realized  that there was a  sex bagel kid  who had the same name.  How are you supposed  to get a job  if your name is Titty Boy?  I am Titty Boy.  I'm here for the job  opening.  As a paralegal?  I'm afraid you're paralegal.  Look, he's driving around  on a boat  except it's on a trailer.  2 Chain's is a dick. 
[01:58:00]  That's kind of silly.  Yeah, whatever.  He's a fucking man.  Look at that old lady.  She's not fresh.  That's fresh.  That ain't fresh.  You're making out  with young guys.  She's white.  That's fucking funny.  Looks like that WWE guy too.  What's his fucking name?  You would know.  I don't know.  Come on, help me out, Sam.  Coco Beware?  I got a picture with him  at the airport.  Oh, Booker T.  Booker T.  Booker T.  Looks like Booker T  with a couple chains.  Look, he's just like  they got love  written on their face  with their bangs.  Don't rappers ever  like Diet Coke?  Why are they always  drinking fucking  fancy liquor? 
[01:58:30]  Because they're partying  and they're celebrating  the good life.  Yeah, but can't you  just celebrate  with a Diet Coke  with a little lime?  I need some  Cavassier, motherfucker.  I don't know.  Every video is  the fucking same.  They're also trying  to sell the liquor.  Oh, that's a good point.  Yeah.  Look at that.  You wouldn't want  to go to that party?  On the boat?  Going down the street?  The boat should be  in the water.  Why is it in the water?  Well, come on.  This swimming thing?  They don't want  to be in the water.  Look, the song is called  I'm Different.  2 Chainz is different.  You put your boat 
[01:59:00]  in the water,  2 Chainz rides the boat  on a trailer.  That's it.  If the boat's not  on the water,  then it just feels squishy.  At least you're like,  oh, we're on the water.  It doesn't matter.  We don't have a lot of space.  We're on the water.  This is cool.  We're on the water.  So you take the water  part out of it.  Normally, there's no room  on the water.  It just sucks.  2 Chainz is the man.  There's no fucking Pitbull,  I'll tell you right now, man.  Pitbull sucks.  Pitbull rules.  2 Chainz.  Look, he's got a birthday cake,  but it looks like a girl's ass.  It's a booty cake.  Who's done that before?  No one.  2 Chainz is the originator. 
[01:59:30]  Who ate a log of shit  when Ace Freely handed him  a fucking birthday cake  shaped like a hiney?  Jim Norton.  Exactly.  I'm fucking, you know,  no chin in 2 Chainz.  2 Chainz is the man right now.  Yeah.  He's got a white guy  dressed up as a clown.  Big A is in there.  He's just a clown.  He's great.  He's better than Pitbull.  Pitbull is the worst.  Um, alright,  we're gonna break, I guess.  Sure.  Will you take back  what you said about 2 Chainz?  No, he's an asshole.  Oh, it does look like a... 
[02:00:00]  Look at this guy.  He's got an Indian guy dancing.  Some Indian guy.  That's fucking funny.  Dance?  You gotta realize  that maybe you made a statement  about 2 Chainz  that was incorrect.  You better recognize.  Oh, we're still watching this?  No, this is a different song.  Oh.  Is there any rap song  just about, like, other things  other than how great you are?  We get it.  Bitches, how great you are.  The girls like you.  We get it at the party.  You're the best.  What is this?  It's fucking awesome.  Will you explain this  to the people? 
[02:00:30]  Well, see, there's men in suits.  Right.  And they're sitting in the backyard  in a line of chairs.  All getting lap dances.  And then there's a guy  barbecuing.  Yeah, ignoring everything.  Wearing a cow shirt.  Right, he's worried about  his steak getting burned.  And the garage is totally smoked out.  Oh, this fucking asshole.  And then Yeezy comes out.  And it's like, okay.  His name's Kanye.  Oh, stupid Kanye.  He's riding a bicycle.  You go down stairs and fall asleep  with the TV out.  Y'all been together 10 years. 
[02:01:00]  You deserve a menage.  Let's see if you put...  What is he driving?  He's driving a bicycle  with a giant cake  with boobies on it.  It's a giant cake.  He's towing with a bicycle  with titties all over it.  Yes.  While this chick's trying  to eat herself out  on the sidewalk.  What's going on  in these videos?  In front of a home  in front of kids  that are flipping the bird.  That are flipping the bird.  Right.  These are bad examples  for the children.  This video stinks.  I didn't know it does. 
[02:01:30]  Look at that.  That chick's got  see-through pants on.  I don't have...  Oh, shit.  We're not talking  about the hineys.  That's what the video's all about.  We're talking about  the actual video.  It's a great video.  Why doesn't CNN  take this shit on?  Like,  they're just smashing.  They'll never...  They're smashing the clown.  They're beating  the white clown.  Oh, white people  are doing it, though.  Even rap got PC.  Yeah, yeah.  They have to have  some white guys in there.  A little diversity  in their gang violence.  And then you got  a black midget.  How is he not cool?  Is that the 2 Chainz guy again? 
[02:02:00]  That's 2 Chainz.  How is he not cool?  It's your birthday.  It's your birthday.  A little black midget.  We have enough birthday songs.  We don't need another one.  No, this is beating  at the Beatles' birthday song.  This is the new birthday song.  Little kids are flipping the bird.  Look at that little fat kid.  What's wrong with just saying  happy birthday to you?  You're racist.  Look at that.  It is just some ignorant shit 
[02:02:30]  celebrating it.  This is Ignat.  Just like,  let's put some ignorant shit up there.  And you can't appreciate that,  Ant?  Be honest.  I can appreciate some ignorant.  Yeah, you kind of like this.  You can be honest about it.  I kind of like it.  You do.  It's just a fun video.  It's hilarious.  Some video hoes.  Look, that bikini bottom  doesn't even fit that girl.  Of course it doesn't.  That's inappropriate.  That's right.  He's way too big.  This song stinks.  Birthday.  It's my birthday.  It's my birthday.  It's a very busy song. 
[02:03:00]  Very busy.  I will say.  Slip and slide.  It's my birthday.  Birthday.  Look at that little black midget  and he's drinking 40 ounce.  Oh yeah.  These are just stereotypes.  I'll say this is a good party  in the background.  You wouldn't go to that party?  I would.  It's your birthday,  you big booty ho.  It's great.  Yeah.  I'm raising my kids  in the same world, huh?  He's wearing a rattlesnake tank top.  You believe it.  Grace.  You deserve a coupe.  You wouldn't get your kid  a rattlesnake tank top?  I would.  I want to find a mountain. 
[02:03:30]  Live up on a mountain.  Look, a girl with boobs  jumped out of the booby cake  that Kanye was bringing  on his bicycle.  Certainly did.  Didn't they have enough  boobies at the party?  Why did they have to bring  a secret booby girl?  Look, that clown  that they just beat  the shit out of  is wearing a gas mask  getting smoked up  in the garage.  That song is fucking awesome.  That's how it ends?  Yes.  Horrendous.  That's not horrendous.  That song was whack as fuck.  What?  Yeah.  Is that good?  Yeah, you ask Drake. 
[02:04:00]  He'll be like,  that's cool.  What's he gonna say?  The United States  are leading one zip  at the end of the first period.  That's cause you gay.  That's cause you gay.  That's cause you gay.  Alright, well let's break.  It's my birthday.  Mm-hmm.  We're gonna break.  Alright.  On that note.  Two chains.  You're a motherfucking tent, Lee.  How dare you?  No.  You like that?  Two chains featuring Kanye West.  How dare you talk ill of two chains.

[02:15:30]  Opie and Anthony have  been creating broadcasting  magic for 20 years.  Doug from the O&A vaults.  This is a 20th anniversary  O&A radio gem.  Cindy Williams.  Hello.  Hi, it's Opie and  Anthony.  Opie, Anthony, how are you  guys?  Very well today.  Thank you, Cindy, and  thanks for helping us out  with Has Been Corner.  My pleasure.  Great first guest we've  ever had on this portion  of our program, Cindy. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, did you just make  that up, or did you steal  it from Andy Kaufman?  Stole it from Andy  Kaufman.  Ah, got it.  We even said we stole it  from Andy Kaufman.  Yeah.  Okay.  And I think you're a  perfect celebrity to start  Has Been Corner with.  Well, thank you.  So what have you been up  to, Cindy?  Nothing, as you know.  Otherwise, why would I be  in Has Been Corner?  Well, you were on  Laverne and Shirley,  obviously, the beloved  Shirley Feeney on  Laverne and Shirley, 
[02:16:30]  and then after that,  there was, um...  What was that?  So, like I said,  Laverne and Shirley,  then...  Nothing.  Really?  No, there must have  been something else.  No, you're conducting  the interview.  Figure it out.  Like Laverne,  she did some movies  and stuff.  Right.  She didn't make the cut  for Has Been Corner  because she's, uh...  Well, she made some, uh...  Do you talk to her anymore?  Sure, I talk to her 
[02:17:00]  all the time.  I don't think this is  going well.  All right, Cindy,  I think we got off  on the wrong foot here.  So what are you promoting  today, Ms. Williams?  Nothing, really.  Nothing that I want  to tell you two about.  You sure?  Yeah.  You all right?  Oh, I'm fine.  You're not going to cry,  are you?  This was just  supposed to be fun.  And it's a barrel of laughs. 
[02:17:30]  You're going to hurt  my feelings  if you hang up crying  and stuff.  I thought we were,  you know,  I thought this would be  a fun thing to do.  It's a lot of fun.  Okay.  All right.  You sure?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Don't want you to leave  and cry or anything.  Okay.  I'm very thankful  that you let me be  the first guest  in your has-been corner  and I really have  nothing to promote  being the has-been  that I am  and I'd like to  thank you both  very much 
[02:18:00]  and I really should  say goodbye.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I don't...  You know,  and no one did tell me  that that was going  to be the gist of this.  That's fine.  I'm just not  a real good sport today.  That's all.  And you hurt my feelings.  But, no.  You really hurt my feelings.  I love you  in Laverne and Shirley.  So, don't,  you know,  you don't need to ever,  you know,  like,  don't watch  Laverne and Shirley. 
[02:18:30]  No, I love you  in Laverne and Shirley.  We love the Laverne and Shirley  and the Squiggy  and the whole gang.  The Big Ragu, right?  The Big Ragu.  Sure.  These are beloved characters.  The other has been.  Look,  we'll never be on a sitcom  as great as Laverne and Shirley.  I know.  So, you got that  to take home with you today.  Well, I am home.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So, you don't want to promote  that you're going to be  at the Meadowlands Convention Center  for the Super Mega Show?  I'll be there.  The has been table. 
[02:19:00]  Signing has been autographed.  Why?  Lindsay Wagner's  going to be there as well?  Yes.  You might want to call her.  You got her number?  No.  No, I haven't.  All right.  Hey, I like milk and Pepsi.  That wasn't me.  Oh.  It was milk and Pepsi.  Remember Laverne and Shirley?  I thought that was Shirley,  but Laverne used to drink  milk and Pepsi.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All the time.  Leave your penis alone. 
[02:19:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  is back on.  I don't remember that one  being as brutal.  Dude, I do not remember  that being.  Holy shit.  That was so difficult to listen to.  The Shirley Feeney.  That was an homage  to Andy Kaufman.  Has been cornered.  Wow.  Who did that exact same bit  with, what's her name?  Cindy Williams.  And Cindy Williams laughed and laughed  and thought it was hilarious  at the time  when Andy Kaufman did it  to some other fool.  But, boy, 
[02:20:00]  didn't quite think it was funny.  Thus then,  we figured,  why not do it to Cindy Williams?  Yeah.  Beautiful.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, that was terrible.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  A little look back.  This song's scary.  This is Sabbath, right?  It's not Sabbath.  This song by Sabbath.  Yeah, this one's scary.  This is from their debut album, right?  First song.  Yeah, I remember this fucking thing.  Sabbath?  I thought that first.  Oh.  They recorded this in a day,  this whole record.  This is devil music, though. 
[02:20:30]  One session.  Really?  Done.  Wow.  One day to mix,  one day to record.  This is when I was all in  with Black Sabbath,  and then I discovered Zeppelin,  and it was over for me.  Sorry.  I still like some Sabbath,  but this is 44 years ago,  the debut album  from Black Sabbath.  That's why we're playing this.  Yeah.  Fuck.  44 years ago today?  Man.  I think Black Sabbath  just scared me.  Yeah, it was very scary.  It scared me, 
[02:21:00]  and then Led Zeppelin  was more kind of bluesy  and a little more fun to it.  I think I can handle Zeppelin  a little better than Black Sabbath.  If your parents heard this music  coming from your fucking room,  you were smoking the dope.  There was a problem.  Right.  You're smoking the dope.  And worshiping the devil.  You're worshiping the devil.  Oh, it just sounds evil.  That fucking bell.  Right.  Dang!  The death bell. 
[02:21:30]  That's great, though.  I might have to break out this album and listen to it again.  Bring back some memories.  Yeah, this is pretty good stuff right here.  I was around 14 or 15.  In the 80s?  No, when I discovered this album.  Oh, yeah, not when this came out?  Yeah, no, no, no, of course.  This came out 44 years ago.  And then, yeah, and then, I don't know.  I remember the defining moment.  It was like Sabbath, and then it was Zeppelin, and they were like both pulling at me. 
[02:22:00]  You took the path of light.  I think so, a little bit.  Yes.  That was the big argument.  It was for a while, right?  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  Anthony, your boy is retiring after this year.  What?  Derek Jeter, your boy.  Oh, wow.  Your boy Jeter.  I can't keep track of all my boys that I got.  He surprised the sports world yesterday, even though I guess he's been hitting at this 
[02:22:30]  for a while.  Derek Jeter's been plagued by some, that ankle injury's really fucked him up.  Right.  So, you know, I guess he figures it's time.  Yeah, he's going to retire after the 2014 season.  Yeah, one more season.  That, that, because he wants the big goodbye.  Oh, boy.  You know?  You thought Rivera got a big send-off.  Oh, he's going to make Rivera send-off ridiculous.  Yes, this is just going to be, they're probably going to market the entire season around the 
[02:23:00]  fact that it's Jeter's last season.  They're going to make a lot of money off it, too.  They're going to make a fuckload of cash.  Right.  It's going to be like, you know, a big thing every home game.  I'm sure they're going to do something.  He must have went through some drills and realized, ah, fuck, there is a drop-off here.  Right?  Yep.  So, good for Jeter.  But he announced on his Facebook, and there was kind of a surprise for a lot of people,  and then it went viral yesterday.  Derek Jeter. 
[02:23:30]  And his last game's going to be at Fenway, I hear.  Oh, yeah.  He'll get a nice ovation at Fenway.  He will absolutely get it.  I'm not a Yankees fan, but I always respected Jeter as a ball player.  Amazing player, and apparently, you know, no controversies, no bad words ever spoken  about the guy.  Except from Jimmy Norton.  Except from our own Jim Norton.  Awkward.  He was a dick that day.  Awkward.  He was a little upset because he went and took a picture with him. 
[02:24:00]  A little awkward that you just said that.  No, not take a picture.  Sign a picture.  Sign a picture.  He was a dick that day.  Right.  But he was signing pictures and taking pictures with girls.  Yes.  I can back up Jimmy on that.  Yeah.  It's one thing that you're not, you know, taking pictures or signing anything, but he  had no problem doing it if you were kind of hot.  Kind of hot.  Wow.  A hot chick.  Wow.  What an asshole.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  Hall of Fame, of course. 
[02:24:30]  Of course.  First fucking ballot Hall of Famer right there.  I don't know about that.  Oh, please.  Let me look at his numbers.  Let me crunch the numbers.  Let me see.  I don't know.  He wasn't really the sweetheart of the press.  I think the paper is...  Oh, Jimmy.  For the love of Jesus.  That was not me.  Oh, no.  No, it wasn't.  Come on.  It was.  Why do we have to smell grown men farts every day?  Because we work in a phone booth.  But I know.  I stopped farting.  They've never farted.  You stopped farting on purpose? 
[02:25:00]  I don't know.  I guess my diet's better.  I just don't fart anymore.  I don't know why I do.  Your diet's better?  Why?  What are you eating or drinking these days?  Oh, well, Anthony.  The Nutribullet.  God, I should be getting paid for this.  Oh, should you?  This should be some good cash.  Should you?  Some good pocket money.  Today, I decided to go with a traditional breakfast smoothie.  I saw that it wasn't as green.  No vegetables today.  Yes.  No vegetables.  No leafy greens.  I know the Nutribullet people, they encourage you to go 50-50 on the vegetables and the fruits. 
[02:25:30]  Someone insisted 50% leafy greens.  I decided, well, my leafy greens were built a bit wilty, so I had to bail on my leafy spinach.  And kale sucks without the spinach.  So that must have been a nice sweet.  You can't taste the kale.  No.  That must have been a nice, sweet, fruity mixture today.  A very fruity, a very breakfast-y one.  Sweet!  Half a banana.  Some skim milk.  Watered down with some water, so really skimmy milk. 
[02:26:00]  Watered down with water.  Wait, skim milk watered down with water.  Yeah.  Kind of makes sense still, no?  Sure.  And then I went raspberries and blueberries, which is a fine combination, I must say.  But the question on everybody's mind right now.  Hold on.  I threw a third fruit in today.  I treated myself to a third fruit.  Sweet!  Oh, shut up with that.  I treated myself to a third fruit today, and that would be pineapple.  I'm very into pineapple these days. 
[02:26:30]  You really do like that pineapple.  And then my boost is...  You gotta have a boost.  My only boost, though.  I gotta, like, change it up with a boost.  Gotta get a boost.  Oh, it's the fistful of oatmeal.  Fistful of raw oatmeal.  I love that movie.  Fistful of...  Is that what it was called?  Fistful of...  Yeah.  Anyway.  Gotta get some chia seeds in the mix.  What?  No, I hear...  Chia seeds.  I hear it's gotta be flax seeds.  Is that literally what they put on chia pets?  I don't think so.  So, why are they called that?  I don't know.  I didn't name them.  Stupid.  What are some of the boosts we got? 
[02:27:00]  Chia seeds.  They boost pretty good.  Yeah.  A little flax seeds.  Flax seeds.  Flax seeds.  Acai berry.  That's a boost?  Oh, yeah.  You get acai berries in there?  I got the golden acai.  What do you call them?  Acai.  What the fuck are you saying?  Acai.  Acai?  All right.  I've heard it both ways.  Acai?  I've heard it both ways, to be honest with you.  You're an asshole-y.  Right.  He's trying to be an intellect.  Exactly.  But I have heard...  It ends with an I.  I'm not trying to be an intellect.  Most people say acai.  Acai. 
[02:27:30]  They really do.  Acai.  I have heard acai-y, if you want to be fancy.  Whenever my wife walks into the room, people go, it's acai.  Oh, she's got it.  She's fat, and she sings Gangnam Style farce.  Why is your wife tipping over, holding an orange?  Dude.  I handed your wife an orange farce, and she fell forward.  Very frail.  Yes, she certainly is.  Your wife sneezed, and 14 teeth fell out. 
[02:28:00]  She propelled herself backwards farce.  Very frail.  Very light.  Yes.  Light and airy.  That whore.  Yes.  Your wife was orbiting around my fat wife, Susan Forst.  What else is in there, Sam?  What other kind of boosts are there?  That's a little...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Flank seed, chia seed, acai berry.  Mo.  Some alemans.  Almonds, yeah.  Almonds?  He puts almonds in there.  Sweet!  Stop saying it. 
[02:28:30]  Why would you be that excited for almonds?  Hey, didn't our favorite guy, the guy that was doing that, whoa, what did it ought to be as we go?  Didn't he say something stupid yesterday, or tweet something stupid?  What?  Yeah, I think he called justice fucking...  What are you talking about?  The beer guy?  Yeah, that same guy.  How do you know it's the same guy?  Because somebody tweeted it.  Said it was the same guy?  Yeah, yeah.  As he finds that, I just want to continue with Jeter for one more second.  Jeter.  The front page of the Daily News today is saying, there's never been a Yankee who's mattered more. 
[02:29:00]  Do you agree with that?  No.  You know what?  There's been some amazing Yankees.  Who, uh...  You got the Lou Gehrig, you got the Babe Ruth.  To his generation of Yankees.  You got the Joe DiMaggio.  What about Joe DiMaggio?  Mickey Mantle?  Mickey Mantle?  He was a hero to people.  But to his generation of Yankees.  But they're not saying his...  That might be true.  They're not saying his generation.  We didn't live through...  Who's mattered more.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Meaning, no one has ever mattered more in the Yankees' pinstarts.  No, I wouldn't say that.  I disagree.  Because Mantle, back when baseball was looked at...  Joe DiMaggio. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Dumb song.  But back then, baseball, those guys were heroes.  Like, now we know that they're flawed fucking HGH douches who fuck chicks on the road.  Yeah.  But Mickey Mantle was a hero to people.  No, I disagree.  Yeah.  The Mantle got death threats when he almost broke his home run record.  Well, it's Mike Lupica.  He's fucking...  Whatever.  In so many ways, there's not been a Yankee who mattered more to the Yankees than Derek  Jeter.  Not since Babe Ruth.  Fuck his wife.  This does not make Jeter bigger than Ruth in either baseball talent or accomplishments. 
[02:30:00]  It does not make him a better player than the great Mariano Rivera.  Who was a closer.  Does not mean he was more of a combination of skill and grace than Joe DiMaggio.  Now he's just insulting him.  Does not mean he ever thrilled people on a ball field the way Mickey Mantle did when  he was young.  Before injury, he stole so much from Mantle across all his own Yankee summers, and alcohol  did its job on him at night.  Doesn't mean he could fuck as well as Mel Hall.  Right.  Keep going.  He's in jail. 
[02:30:30]  Fucking a 12-year-old.  Holy shit.  I don't think it was Mel Hall.  Mel Hall.  Oh, you're right.  You're thinking of...  Who was I thinking of?  Mel Allen or something.  This week in baseball.  No, you're right.  You're right.  This week in baseball.  But in the modern world, and that really means the Yankee universe of the past 20 years,  no one is even more the face of the Yankees.  It was more important to their brand than Jeter has been since he ran out to shortstop for  good one April afternoon in 96. 
[02:31:00]  I think he should say that on the fucking front page.  In the modern era.  The last 20 years.  Yes.  Whatever.  Indeed.  He's number one in a lot of the stats, though, for the Yankees.  Mm-hmm.  I remember hearing about Derek Jeter before he was a pro.  When he was a rookie, they were talking about this hot kid.  Yeah.  And this prospect.  He was like 94, 93.  And coming up in the minor league system, Derek Jeter.  Yeah.  So we started radio two years before Jeter ran out to shortstop.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:31:30]  That's pretty fucked up.  What the fuck?  Started radio together.  I did a few before that, even.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, huh?  Jesus Christ.  That was a while ago.  So, your boy Jeter.  Good for him, huh?  You going to go to a lot of the games to say goodbye to your boy?  Yeah, I do like catching the Yankee games.  Yeah.  It would be nice.  Nice warm afternoon.  Oh, boy.  That seems like fantasy land now. 
[02:32:00]  The snow and the fucking cold.  You think the Yankees got to Jeter, too, and said, look, the Yankees are going to have a shitty year, right?  Well, they had a shitty year last year, too.  I can't imagine it's going to be much better this year.  I don't think it's going to be getting much better.  No, they've got a pretty decent year.  No, they've got that guy that just flew over there from Japan.  He flew himself over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  They've got a chance.  They always have a chance.  And they're saddled with that whole fucking A-Rod situation.  That's not affecting them this year. 
[02:32:30]  No.  And then A-Rod comes back in 2015.  Yeah, right.  With all that money.  Yeah, right.  Fuck.  All right.  Well, we hardly knew ye.  Hardly knew ye.  New ye.  Soon ye.  Man, look at that.  Brian in Denver.  Brian, oh.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I heard you guys talking about the Nutribullet.  Nice.  Pineapple, isn't there?  Yeah.  Pineapple?  You like pineapple?  Pineapple rules.  Sweet.  What's up?  I do.  I work with a guy that used to be an adult film star. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  What were you, a fluffer?  Exactly.  What did you do?  Bring him as AZT?  Who did he work for?  No, I worked in construction.  The older guy used to do this shit, but it was telling me the secret to pineapple.  It makes you have a big old fat nut that makes it sweet, so your girl, I'm a problem  choking that shit down.  Oh.  So, it gives you big loads.  Big loads.  But they taste...  Big, sweet loads.  Like a bit of Hawaii.  Yes, sir.  Big, giant, sweet loads.  All right.  That's delicious. 
[02:33:30]  Certainly does.  Something to keep in mind.  I think all that shit's bullshit.  I think it is, too.  I haven't noticed a difference in my loads.  A load's a load.  I've absolutely upped my pineapple.  Yeah.  Hell, yeah.  You haven't noticed giant loads?  No.  Just stringing, flying, rope flying out.  Why do you need giant loads?  Isn't a regular load good enough?  I videotaped myself shooting a load.  It was a fucking...  A good fucking...  Good arcing? 
[02:34:00]  No.  It was pointed right at me.  I did it onto a black napkin.  Like a fucking dark napkin.  It was a blurka, blurka, blurka.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's a thick one.  Why would you videotape that?  Why wouldn't you is the question.  All right.  I don't know.  No, I just felt like doing it.  I felt like I had a good one coming.  And perhaps somebody expressed interest in seeing it.  Oh, well.  Keep our texts to yourself, Jimmy.  Wasn't you.  Oh.  It's a girl. 
[02:34:30]  So the Jeter thing's big.  Yeah.  Really big.  Derek.  Derek Jeter.  Jeter.  Jeter.  Yeah.  Yeah, they still use that, right?  Baba.  Derek Jeter.  Oh, God.  What's his name?  Jesus Christ.  The old Cremontor.  Bob Shepard, right?  Good old Bob Shepard who passed.  Baba Shepard.  Still use him introducing Jeter.  For Jeter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be a biggie, though.  That's going to be a big...  His last game at Yankee Stadium is going to be the one to go to.  You think it'll be hard to get tickets for? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you should see the rest of the StubHub.  Already?  How much?  Well, single game tickets aren't on sale, so the people that are selling them right now  have season ticket plans.  Right.  But I think they went from like, you know, $80 yesterday morning to like thousands.  Oh!  Go take your umbrella and stuff it in an umbrella stand.  That's right.  Our ticket lady right now.  Put her in a tough spot.  Yeah, right?  We want tickets.  She's been a fan of ours for like a long time.  Just say, hey, if you really love us... 
[02:35:30]  She's going to be his last home game.  Need that.  Well, there's going to be like two games to go to.  It's going to be his last home game, and then probably the weekend before that, when  they do like Derek Jeter Day.  Oh, yeah?  They won't do it on his last home...  Oh, no, because they'll get an extra big day.  Well, they usually do those on weekends.  They're calling it a stunning fall for Ray Nagin.  Yeah.  The New Orleans mayor they just arrested.  They do an entire day over there at Yankee Stadium.  Uh-huh.  They ever do a tire day over at Yankee Stadium?  I think it was proposed once.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Why? 
[02:36:00]  I don't know.  Give away tires.  Doesn't even make any sense.  It's a bad idea.  It is.  Seinfeld.  Oh, yeah.  You know what Derek Jeter learned this.  Because now I have to say Seinfeld, because if I don't, they go, hey, gotcha!  He gotcha!  That one!  So now I've got to say it.  He gotcha.  I know the bit now, so I let it fly.  But these idiots, hey, he gotcha on another Seinfeld.  Yeah.  I heard a guy had to go all the way to Akron.  Yeah.  Akron, Ohio, to fucking talk it out.  But I guess they got it in some kind of a little tiff. 
[02:36:30]  Well, the Seinfeld, when Seinfeld goes, hey, your hair's a little longer than normal.  Huh?  What?  Just relaying my chat from yesterday.  Oh!  Did you see Jerry yesterday?  You got to talk to Jerry.  Jerry, he's my pride and joy.  He noticed you?  At this comedy seller?  Yeah, but, you know, he's...  Nice.  And noticed your hair was a little longer than usual.  A couple of icons chatting.  Is that all he said, though?  No, no, we talked about it.  Oh, that's cool.  That's very cool.  A couple of those handling of that situation. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Did he spout off like Kramer?  No, he was actually very grounded about it.  Yeah.  That's very cool.  Was Colin shining his shoes at the time?  No, Colin was outside having his oil change.  That's why Jerry was there.  He said Colin went out and took his vehicle and got an oil change.  Colin was like, oh, that's fell on my fingers.  That's great.  Change the oil.  It's Jerry's gone.  You know, what are you going to do?  I got my pro-keds on. 
[02:37:30]  You know.  He's got nothing but Porsches.  Yeah, he loves his Porsches.  They are so wee.  Let's go to Matt in Canada.  Matt.  God, I hate that.  You don't like that.  Team USA, we have a blowback this morning.  You guys should have her on.  What happened?  Team USA, you're a lift of cocky.  The boys are playing right now.  Just driving to work.  Why should we have it on?  We're watching it.  It's not even a game.  The U.S. is winning 4-1.  Blowout.  At least I got an update out of you, boys. 
[02:38:00]  He's not going to go out and update out of you, boys.  You boys.  I love Olympic hockey, but this game's a bust.  It's 4-1 already.  Halfway through the second period, if you care.  What?  Hey, boys.  What?  What?  Right, Mr. Canada.  Sports Illustrated swimsuit is getting wacky.  You heard what they're doing, right?  Yeah.  They're putting Barbie on the cover.  That's just a... 
[02:38:30]  Barbie.  Just so everyone will talk about it.  That's my Barbie.  What's the reason for putting Barbie on the cover?  Travis, do you know?  It's an anniversary.  Yeah.  It's like, what?  How many years?  50?  Barbie, 50 years?  And I think it's just like a promotional rap cover, you know?  So you take it off.  Oh, is that by 2 Chainz?  Oh, I got...  Nice.  There's Barbie wearing her signature bikini that she was introduced in way back in the day,  as they called it 50 years ago.  I think so.  Can I read the first sentence of this article? 
[02:39:00]  Because it's terrific.  Please do.  Red-blooded beauties, step aside.  Nice.  A plastic Barbie doll will join a generation of iconic stunners next week in the Sports  Illustrated 50th Anniversary Swimsuit Edition.  There you go.  Step aside.  I liked her younger sister, Skipper.  Was it Skipper?  Sounds like it, yeah.  And what was the black one?  How do you know this shit?  Barbie's younger sister, Skipper.  Right.  And then there was the black one.  What was her name?  I just... 
[02:39:30]  I started laughing.  I was like...  No, it wasn't Shanika.  Skipper?  Skipper.  I know because my sister played with Barbie dolls.  And me and my sister...  Was she allowed to play with the black ones?  Yeah, but I don't think she had any.  I don't think she wanted any.  You know, my kids want white dolls.  I wish she had a brush with the same hair.  Yeah.  That's true.  She was taught properly by...  She was taught properly by mom and dad.  Mom was no fucking...  Not to bring a black Barbie into that house. 
[02:40:00]  Mom was no fucking beacon of diversity herself, let me tell you.  Oh, really?  I heard an N-bomb come out of her mouth a few times.  And then every time you'd ask her for something, she'd go,  What do I look three shades darker than you?  Do it yourself.  And then, boy, did she love calling us nigger rich all the time.  Oh, boy, did she love that one.  You get a little money in your birthday card from grandma.  Could I go to the store?  What, are you going to spend it right away like you nigger rich?  All right, mom.  Well, how much was it?  Ten bucks?  Ten bucks.  I was supposed to, you know, fucking open an IRA with it or something. 
[02:40:30]  Except my kid with fucking birthday money, of course, I'm going to spend it.  Birthday money?  You just spent it right away.  Exactly.  That's not fiscally responsible.  It wasn't.  That's not fiscally responsible continues to this day.  I've learned a lot.  Jimmy Kimmel is going to unveil the Sports Illustrated cover tonight.  Me and my sister used to play G.I. Joe and Barbie.  Because I had G.I. Joe's, she had a Barbie, and then, you know, if there was nothing going 
[02:41:00]  on, it would be like, all right, G.I. Joe and Barbie.  But it would always end with just atrocities happening.  Like, I would behead the Barbies and ransack the Barbie Dreamhouse.  Right.  Destroy everything in there, and then I'd leave Dawn just crying because the G.I. Joe Barbie  play session did not go well.  How much older are you than her or she than you?  What is it, like, maybe four years, five years, something like that. 
[02:41:30]  You're older or she is?  I'm older.  I'm the older brother.  And then Joe's, like, 18 months older than me.  You're the middle child.  I'm the middle kid.  Oh, the Jan Brady.  I'm the Jan Brady, yes.  The Jan Brady.  I didn't really notice that, though.  I think we were all neglected.  I don't think there's any of that going on because, you know, once Pops split, you know,  Mom had to work and everything, so she was never around.  We pretty much, you know, we pretty much ran the house by ourselves. 
[02:42:00]  Just go in, staying up until all hours.  On a school night, it wasn't unusual to go to sleep at 1, 2 in the morning.  Jesus, really?  Yeah.  Because it was just fucking, you know.  Our parents wanted us out of the fucking way.  We'd watch on TV.  We'd watch Johnny Carson every night.  Well, wouldn't they watch you just out of the way?  No, they weren't even there.  Oh.  It was just me, my brother and sister.  At what age is?  Fucking from when I was, like, fucking, 8, 9, 10. 
[02:42:30]  9, 10.  Jesus.  Like that, around there.  You're still scared of the dark at that age.  And then having no parents.  I was scared of the dark.  And then having no parents in the house.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, it was, I was scared of everything back then.  But I think that had a lot to do with it.  I didn't really have, you know what it was?  I realized I didn't have much faith in adults or my parents, you know, because they were 
[02:43:00]  never around.  So I never felt like there was anybody there to protect me.  And that's why I think I was so afraid of everything.  And that's why, at this point now, you live with a .50 cal and have a weapon at all times.  Because somebody still doesn't feel safe.  I understand it.  Well, you know, look at the news, my friend.  I'm not saying it's not, it's totally irrational.  Part of it is, though.  Part of it is.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  Most of the world's cool, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, the news just highlights all the really scary shit.  I understand this, but everybody that gives me that argument are the same people that 
[02:43:30]  go out and buy fucking Mega Millions tickets, where the odds are a lot less likely of winning  than they are of having somebody try to do physical harm to you.  Yeah, I don't believe in the Mega Millions.  I think that's stupid.  It is stupid.  I think I won, but I'm just too lazy to check.  Right.  That would be tragic.  What was the first African-American Barbie doll name?  Well, Francie was Barbie's cousin.  Francine?  Francine.  Is that the retarded one?  Dumb Barbie. 
[02:44:00]  Dumb Barbie.  In her own feet.  With the fucking little baby Barbie that would drop out from between its legs.  Francie.  But Christy is the very well-known.  Christy, that's the one.  That was the bridge traffic Barbie.  That is sweet.  Oh, no, it's not sweet.  Let's see.  You don't like that?  No.  It's catchy.  No, it's not.  G.I. Joe's ruled, though.  True. 
[02:44:30]  Fucking great as a kid.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Especially when you fucking, you know, Vietnam.  You had an enemy.  Fucking playing with G.I. Joe's and fucking getting a gun.  Fucking get that guy.  Right.  Charlie the 80s.  Goddamn.  Boom.  Yeah, but when you said he was God, he was God.  You'd be like, I gotcha.  And the other doll went at the fall.  Yeah.  You know, I didn't say it was realistic.  It looked like I was fucking playing out Saving Private Ryan on the...  It looked like shit.  No.  Yeah, it's a little stiff guy.  Yes.  It looks like that woman that got tased in Atlanta. 
[02:45:00]  It just falls over.  Two by four.  You enjoy that one?  I love that one.  I just watched it again the other day for fun.  You gay.  Our kids.  That's why you gay.  Because you gay.  And then they tase her and the guy comes over.  Do that in front of the babies.  It's like, did you see what she was doing in front of the babies?  Yeah, that guy was great.  Fucking saying all kinds of shit.  Hitting the guy.  We got to take a break because we got to set up for our next guest. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, right.  We got a terrific guest planned for after the break.  Indeed.  His name's Richard Betts.  Oh, yeah?  He's promoting the essential scratch-and-sniff guide to becoming a wine expert.  Ah, oh, the essential scratch-and-sniff guide.  You got it right in front of you.  Let me do it.  Spell W-H-I-N-E.  Oh, boy.  Get it?  Now, whoa.  Whoa.  I'm smelling it already. 
[02:46:00]  You can smell some shit.  Yeah.  So this is a scratch-and-sniff book, and you're supposed to...  It looks like a children's book.  Now, I like a good Shiraz.  Right.  And I'm wondering if there's one in here.  Let me see.  Is this...  How do you know which one's a scratch-y sniff?  Yeah.  It's got a thing over it.  Yeah, you scratch the one that smells like lavender tump.  Where's the scratch-and-sniff?  It's a little mark in there, you fucking eight-year-old.  Look in there.  Where?  Every page has a mark where you scratch and smell.  Where?  The sniff would be your nose, and the scratch would be your fingernail. 
[02:46:30]  No, look!  Where?  Don't start crying.  Right here?  He doesn't have a lot of the scratch-and-sniffs in his book, Sam.  I don't know.  Oh, man.  There's a little finger pointing to it on every page.  Oh, it's a finger pointing to it?  Yes.  What do you think that is?  I like to scratch and sniff, but I do it with my balls.  Let me see this dumb book.  After I cut the grass, I would take my hand and run it along the ball bag, thigh-meaning place, and take a whiff so deep that I almost ran out of air. 
[02:47:00]  When I lived in North Brunswick, you know what I used to do to get me through cutting the grass?  I used to hate doing it, but I would pretend that Howard Cosell was announcing me cutting the grass.  No, you didn't.  I would.  I'm looking.  He's almost finished with the backyard.  He's going up the side.  I would just think that together.  Oh, I wish he was going, Jimmy's down.  The mower's running over his head.  Oh, you don't smell your fingers.  Yeah.  I hope he's doing it wrong.  Oh, you feel for that plastic shit. 
[02:47:30]  No, I hope you don't do it.  I would always smell the fingers.  No, you scratch, and then you smell the book.  It's got a little old-timey finger-pointing hand.  Yeah, you're right.  My booger smell's getting in the way.  Is that a Harlem Globetrotter guy?  Probably.  What gave it away?  The black guy, and he's wearing a red, white, and blue fucking uniform.  And he's 6'11".  This is a stupid book.  Oh, come on, Opie.  Now that's our guess.  He's trying to bring fun back to buying wine.  But what does it have to do with wine?  He'll tell us.  He's trying to bring fun to buying wine?  Yes.  That doesn't smell like pear, by the way. 
[02:48:00]  That didn't smell like pear.  No.  Well, this is questions you can ask him when he's on the phone.  It doesn't smell like dill.  You don't think so?  Try the dough.  I got it.  Yeah.  That doesn't smell like vanilla.  This is an idea that someone gets, and then you just don't follow through with it, even  past the conversation.  They all have ideas like this.  Then you go, all right, that was stupid.  You know what?  We should get a scratch.  The next day, the idea is always stupid.  I'm sure it started with that.  Everyone, you know, when you open a bottle of wine, you pour it in, and you smell it. 
[02:48:30]  The smell of wine is very important.  We should have a scratch-and-sniff wine book.  Do you peel this off?  No.  Because this doesn't smell like bacon.  Oh, man.  What does it smell like?  I don't...  Nothing.  I don't know.  Compare it with E-Rox's breath and see if it's...  I don't know.  I don't know.  But you're supposed to scratch it.  Flowers.  First one.  Flowers.  Flowers smells like flowers.  You're supposed to scratch it and sniff the page.  That is true.  Smells very...  Smell like...  Nightmare fingers.  That almost smells like butter.  But what does butter have to do with wine? 
[02:49:00]  I guess we'll find out, right?  Well...  Oh, we'll find out.  So we're going to talk to this guy next.  His book is literally 12 pages.  I want a stink finger.  It looks like a children's book.  I want a stink finger every spot you scratch and sniff on there.  Just stink finger it.  What you do is you put your finger in your asshole and you rub it and you tell someone,  like, what do you think of this grape bouquet?  And they rub their nail over where your fucking shit feckles are.  And they sniff it and get hepe.  I want to do a scratch and sniff book where every one smells like doody. 
[02:49:30]  And I just want to call it the smells of my shit.  A day on the show with Jim Morton.  You scratch different places in the studio and it smells like a gasser?  Everything's a gasser.

This your boy, Ice Cube, the West Coast warlord.  And you know what I'm doing?  Kicking it down.  We holding it down for the West Coast.  Yo, I'm just telling y'all, the encore of the Opie and Anthony show is going to start at 11 a.m. on the East 
[03:00:30]  and 8 a.m. for my homies on the West.  Boom, y'all.  So if you miss any of this shit and you want to hear it all again, tune in and check it out.  Tune in and check it out.  Well, say, throw them dubs up.  Hey, this is Dr. Steve from Weird Medicine with another Dr. Steve Medical Minute.  Well, there are a lot of causes of erectile dysfunction, and some of them are actually reversible. 
[03:01:00]  And before I did anything else, I'd check a blood sugar to make sure you're not diabetic, check a testosterone level.  In addition, if you're on certain antidepressants or blood pressure pills, these can cause refractory erectile dysfunction as well.  Also, quit smoking.  Nicotine is the number one cause of flaccid penis syndrome in men over 40. 
[03:01:30]  Once these things are all ruled out and everything else fails, you might indeed be a candidate for Caberject.  Now, the active ingredient in Caberject is Alprostadil, which causes an immediate and long-lasting erection even in the limpest of dicks.  The problem is you have to inject it into the base of your penis with a needle.  Thankfully, there is an alternative to this called the Muse system, which is a pellet of Alprostadil that you shove down your cock hole with a little plastic device.  And it works well and no needle.  The downside, it costs a fortune, but your insurance should pay for it. 
[03:02:00]  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine, Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern, right here on the Opie and Anthony Channel.  Go ahead.  Clean the bowl with your salt.  Opie and Anthony are back.  Thank you, Travis.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[03:02:30]  Very excited.  Being a wine drinker myself, and certainly Anthony likes his wine as well.  Certainly do.  Our next guest is going to be a terrific guest.  I'm a big wine drinker.  I do have the little wine cellar in the basement.  Yes, you do.  And I stock up.  Remember, Anthony, wine is a grocery, not a luxury.  What does that mean?  I guess we'll find out.  Yeah, we're going to find out.  It's on the front page of, on the cover, I should say, of The Essential Scratch and Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert by Richard Betts. 
[03:03:00]  I'm very interested to see what his take is on that, because I think he...  His take, take a whiff of that.  Ah, there it is.  Huh?  Because I'm...  I had a little wordplay there for everybody.  I'm thinking maybe...  Forever Bonner.  Forever Bonner.  Maybe not taking wine as seriously as other people do.  Of course not.  Keeping it a little fun.  Is that what we're...  I think so.  ...we're looking at here?  Yes.  About the author.  That's me. 
[03:03:30]  Le Nose de Betts.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  See?  There you go.  That's his nose.  Le Nose de Betts.  That's his actual nose, I bet you.  Yeah.  Or we're going to find out soon.  Ha, ha, ha.  In this book, when you see this, meaning the little finger, be sure to do this, and that  would be scratch.  Yes.  And then you do a little sniff-a-roo.  About the author, that's me.  I was well on my way to becoming an attorney when I stuck my nose in a particular glass 
[03:04:00]  of wine that would vividly recall specific memories.  One sniff, and I was transported to a restaurant where I could see where my wife sat, what she  ate, and what she wore, all nearly five years earlier.  Who knew a smell could do that?  Thus, the JD was forsaken, and I jumped headlong into the world of wine, becoming only the ninth  person to pass the Master Sommelier, that guy, the Sommelier, whatever, exam on the 
[03:04:30]  first attempt, and one of fewer than 200 Master, how do you say that fucking word for real, Sommelier,  Sommelier, I forget.  What is it, how you spell it?  S-O-M-M-E-L-I-E-R-S.  He's a Sommelier at the restaurant, whatever the, Sommelier, Sommelier, Sommelier, Sommelier,  Sommelier, Sommelier, Sommelier, Sommelier, Sommelier, that's the first page of the 10-page  book, by the way.  All right.  So let's talk to Richard Betts.  He's on our phones here.  But he gambles.  Very, very excited about this. 
[03:05:00]  Richard Betts, thanks for joining the Opie and Anthony show, sir.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Thanks for having me.  No problem.  We're very excited, because you've got two wine guys in studio here.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  Right on.  I like it.  Yeah.  Right.  So the book is terrific.  It's a scratch-and-sniff guide to becoming a wine expert.  Now, this is a way to keep from, you know, it doesn't seem very snobby.  That's good, because a lot of people think wine is synonymous with snobs. 
[03:05:30]  Because this keeps it fun.  Keeps it fun for everybody.  That's what it's supposed to be.  Ah!  No snobs allowed.  No snobs allowed.  NSA.  Yes.  Good one, Jim.  So why write a book there, Richard?  You know, that's a good question.  Of course it is.  Oh.  Of course.  You guys are full of those.  I was up late one night with a friend on a ski trip and talking about, well, we had drunk  several bottles of wine.  Right.  Talking about wine books. 
[03:06:00]  Getting suited.  Nice.  Right.  Totally.  You know, and a lot of wines have a lot to share, but they're also pretty stuffy.  Yeah.  Right?  Uh-huh.  True.  So when it's the whole ambition, it's knock it off the pedestal, bring it to more people,  make it fun, then why not write a scratch-and-sniff wine book?  Absolutely.  What better way to do it?  Yeah.  I think people are under the impression that wine is kind of an expensive thing and should  be held to a higher standard, you know?  Right. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  That's the absolute way to think about it.  I think skip all that.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Drink it out of a box, out of a can.  Oh, I love that.  Your top bottle.  Just, you know, hey, if it makes you feel good, you should do it.  Some people say that the year matters.  Some people say it doesn't.  You know, it depends on the wine, but yeah, it's an agricultural product, and you know,  right now, California's in a drought, so it's not going to taste like it tastes about it.  Oh, man.  Is it true you don't have to spend a lot of money on a bottle of wine? 
[03:07:00]  Right.  It's totally true.  You got your hand bucket.  Exactly.  You can be happy.  Right.  I find the more expensive wines, for the most part, are the better tasting wines.  I just, that's just me, though.  You're buying labels, sir.  Tell him, Richard.  He's buying labels.  God damn it.  You're buying happiness.  Do what you want to do.  I mean, like, no one tells you what to have for dinner, right?  You choose that.  Well, it all depends on, you know, if you're married, then the boss tells you, you know. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, man.  Hey, Richard, it's all about the oak barrel, isn't it?  Well, if it's aging in oak barrel, it can be all about the oak barrel, but yeah.  And I, I, I, hey, we got a Harlem Globetrotters guy outside of the studio.  Oh, what is, what's he doing?  Waving him in?  He's spinning a basketball.  Metal Ark Lemon?  No, Metal Ark.  No, it's not Metal Ark Lemon.  Metal Ark died.  It was, he passed, he was, he passed away about two weeks ago.  What happened there?  You did?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, it was a really weird thing. 
[03:08:00]  It was, it was an armed robbery slash car accident.  It was, it was a very, very big piece of news.  It's terrible.  You didn't hear that, Richard.  No, I didn't hear that.  Yeah, what wine do you drink with a tragic death?  Well, I gotta say, the Harlem Globetrotter guy is a bit desperate.  He's walking up and down the hall hoping someone is gonna notice that he spins a basketball well  and invite them into their studio, and so far there's no takers.  Well, it worked.  Sam couldn't wave him in fast enough.  Old helicopters arm Roberts.  Yeah.  Sir, did you ever see the Columbo with a wine episode with Donald Pleasence? 
[03:08:30]  I did not.  Tell me about it.  It's where he's going, you are the Duke of New York, you're a number one.  It was a good one.  He owned a vineyard, and he made wine, and his brother wanted to sell the vineyard to  like this company that just puts out like crappy wines at quantity to make money.  And the other guy didn't want to do it, so he locked his brother in the wine cellar  and turned off all the ventilation.  He dies.  Fuck.  Yeah, then he comes back and threw him in the water with his scuba gear on.  Right.  On the guys that he's, you know, people are gonna think he'd drown. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  Oh, I like it.  Columbo got it.  Yeah, they always figure that shit out.  But, yeah, because Columbo figured out that the ventilator was shut off in the wine cellar  because the wine went bad.  Ah.  Ah, there you go.  And also there was a wine bottle in the man's hiney.  Right.  There.  A live one on the phone.  Watch it.  So, why the book?  I wasn't really paying attention.  So, you were skiing with your buddies, you had a bunch of wine, and then what happened? 
[03:09:30]  We were just talking about wine books in general.  You know, he's like, so we're having a good time.  He's like, you gotta share this information.  Like, how do you get this out there and scale it, right?  And, you know, Chris is good at thinking like that.  He's like, you gotta do a book.  I was like, you know, I don't have anything to contribute to the stodgy old wine book.  Obviously.  You know?  So, I want to do something fun if we're going to do something.  Right.  And we're mad around a bunch of ideas.  But when a sniff fell on the table, we're just like... 
[03:10:00]  And why did you decide ten pages is perfect for a book?  Oh.  You know, why does it have to be long?  Right.  You know why?  Exactly.  Why does it have to be long?  I mean, look.  What a great answer.  My job isn't to take up your time.  My job is to make you smile.  Exactly.  And do that by helping you understand.  Brian Regan talked about a great book.  Well, you should be fired.  Brian Regan talked about a great book called The Clock.  And that wasn't a long book either.  Right.  I got a question, too.  TikTok. 
[03:10:30]  What?  What goes into making something bouquet?  How does the bouquet become the bouquet?  They always say the bouquet, is that the snow?  Stop saying that.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  No.  Because if it's a bouquet, where's the flowers?  Shit.  About it.  I would think...  I would...  Found a friend.  I would think because of the importance of the nose of a wine, that that is what inspired  you to do the scratch and sniff.  Richard, can I correct Anthony? 
[03:11:00]  It's not the nose.  It's le nose.  Le nose de bits.  Oh.  Just proven that I read your book, sir.  Oh.  It took me five minutes.  Oh.  What is the...  What's the word?  Sommier.  What is that?  Is that how you say that word?  It's how you say that word.  It's basically someone that's committed themselves to wine and are there to make it easy for you  guys.  Right.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well.  All right.  So we scratch and sniff.  I don't understand the scratch and sniff thing.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  How do we use this book, sir?  Yeah.  I'm still confused.  How do we use it?  You wrote a very brief wine book and you could scratch some stuff and sniff it, right?  Yep.  That's very true.  I wrote a very brief wine book that'll teach you everything you need to know about what  you like.  That's it.  You like it.  Okay.  You should take it home to your boss and see what she likes and then make her happy.  Whoa.  Yeah, man.  Wow.  My mother always said, the lady runs the house, Chippa. 
[03:12:00]  Good one, Chippa.  Even when the man pounds her into the sheets proper.  Yeah.  There you go.  Of course he likes Chippa.  There you go.  A boxed wine.  Is it worth even getting?  A box of wine?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I've had my experiences with boxed wine.  Yeah, there are some good ones out there.  No, there can't be.  There sure can.  You're insane.  A plastic fucking bag in a box?  Totally.  A lot of wines in a bottle were in a plastic bag or a plastic jug at one point before it 
[03:12:30]  got stuck into a glass bottle.  Yeah, but...  It's a part of its life.  But if it's a twist off, you don't have any class.  I'd rather drink out of a plastic bag hanging on someone's hip.  Sure.  That's how I...  It's funny.  That's how you drink.  That's how I have stew.  And a nice red does go with stew.  What do we do?  A little Merlot?  What do you drink with stew? 
[03:13:00]  You've got to go Cabernet with stew.  Cab?  Tell him, Richard.  Depends on what stew likes.  Yeah, well, that's true.  You've got to drink whatever you like.  Ah, see, this guy's no rules.  He's fucking crazy.  You're throwing out the rules.  He's throwing out the rule book and replacing it with his scratch and sniff book.  One of the things in the scratch and sniff book for eight-year-olds is the bacon.  Yes, the bacon.  I'm scratching the bacon right now, okay?  Yep.  No, you smell the book, not your finger.  Exactly.  Yeah, you smell the book.  That just smells like wine with anus. 
[03:13:30]  The idea.  It doesn't really smell like bacon on that note.  What is it smelling?  Like plastic.  If he holds up the book, just smack the book.  Oh!  Holy shit, no!  Man, this guy don't play!  My mother's friend did that.  Lamar held up Jet and said, smell this.  And then I did, and I felt his fist hit me in the face.  Well, it should have.  You don't play, and I don't play, sir.  That's it.  That's what I do. 
[03:14:00]  Damn!  Now go home and get your fucking scratch and sniff book.  I'm going to show it to the bathroom.  There you go.  Exactly.  All right.  Anyway.  You know what?  I like a good Shiraz.  Yes.  Oh, do I like a nice, spicy Shiraz.  What's your opinion on those?  Dude, I dig them.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Yep.  A lot of Australian Shiraz.  Yeah.  What is his, uh, what's the name of the book?  Oh, no.  Uh, let me see here the name of the book. 
[03:14:30]  It's, uh, The Essential Scratch and Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert.  Do you think it's going to work for you?  It's working for him.  It's, uh, you, you almost done reading it over there?  It's absorbent pages. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  It's, oh, God, it stinks.  Not the book, sir.  There's, um, there's an aroma wafting up here that is not in your scratch and sniff book.  Anyway.  There we go.  Richard, you want to take some questions?  Oh, we got some callers.  A lot of our listeners, uh, very excited.  Very excited, uh, to learn a little bit about wine. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Let's do it.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me, uh, all right.  Let's, I'm just, you know what?  For some reason, we don't know what they're going to ask, unfortunately.  So let's just start from the top.  All right.  We'll go.  I see it's Jason, though.  Jason in Akron.  Jason, what's going on?  You're on with Richard Betts, who has a fantastic wine book.  Hi, Richard.  I was wondering if you double as the leprechaun for the Denver Broncos.  Huh?  No, you know, I don't.  It sounds like a fun thing to do, though. 
[03:16:00]  Oh.  Oh, it's very fun.  Why would you say that, Jason?  He sounds gay.  What?  Whoa.  Well, I don't even think...  Are leprechauns gay?  I don't think, uh, anybody's sexuality has any...  What?  ...has any bearing on anything in this situation, sir.  And liking wine doesn't make you gay, sir.  Um, uh, I'm, I'm personally offended by that phone call.  Richard, I'm sorry.  Don't worry about it.  Sorry, Richard. 
[03:16:30]  Richard, obviously, the story you, um...  It's all right if you're gay.  Yeah, the story you told about you and your buddy drinking wine and coming up with the book.  We don't care about your lifestyle.  That's fine.  Right.  That's fine by us.  Absolutely.  I appreciate your consideration.  All right.  Yeah.  Uh, let me go to Dr. Steve in Tennessee.  Oh.  Dr. Steve.  Uh, yeah, you know, I, I make my own wine, uh, usually in my bathtub.  Uh, by wringing out my own, uh, ass hairs. 
[03:17:00]  I was wondering if Richard knew of any other fluids that might be, to make a good bouquet.  Let's see.  You should just take a whiz while you're in there, man.  Ah, like Opie.  What are you talking about?  What the fuck?  I had a question.  I'm looking on Amazon, Richard.  I'm seeing that George Wendt, who's a sad drunk, has a book that's 240 pages, and yours  is only 10.  Yeah.  How do you explain that?  I don't know, George, man.  That was, uh, that was Norm from, uh, from Cheers. 
[03:17:30]  Remember Cheers?  Now, Richard, Richard, I'm going to, I'm going to get you back on track, though, because,  um, you know, I'm sure they don't use ass hairs in, in wines, but what are some of the  other unusual things they do put in wines?  See how I fucking bring this back to center for everybody?  Hey, buddy, thank you.  Saved that call.  Uh, lots of bugs, lots of snakes, all kinds of, anything that lives in the vineyard can  very frequently end up in the wine.  Really?  Oh, yeah, totally.  Wait, so there's, there's wines that absolutely have snakes in them? 
[03:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Think about, like, that, that bottle of Shiraz you were drinking a minute ago.  Right.  You know, if you, if you paid, like, six bucks for it, and it came from Australia.  Right.  It probably came from some very hot vineyard, where they don't pick the grapes by hand.  They go through these big machines that basically shake the grapes off.  Who's buying a six dollar bottle of wine?  Charlotte's expensive.  Sounds like you, your, your sort of style.  Oh, my God.  Look.  Whoa. 
[03:18:30]  Look, I have an expensive palate, sissy boy.  Don't you friggin'.  Whoa.  Wow.  Let's, let's, let's move on to the next caller.  Holy shit, shoot.  Uh, Bob, uh, Bob, what's your last name there, sir?  Uh, Thomas.  It's Bob Thomas.  I'm a fine lover of wine.  I was just wondering what flavor would go good with a good, uh, date rape. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, gee, that's...  Richard, I apologize.  Can we just get serious questions only here?  That's not cool.  We need serious questions.  Sorry, Richard.  You guys have some intense listeners.  They, yeah, yeah.  They run the gamut, sir.  This hour of the morning, um...  You know, they run the gamut.  It's a little crazy.  Uh, how about a little more about the book?  What do you want to know?  I don't know.  Let's, uh, let's go to page 10 out of...  Wait, page 10 is the end of the book. 
[03:19:30]  Wait a minute.  Hold on a minute.  Sorry.  Page, uh, 7.  Let's go to page 7.  Mm-hmm.  Cool.  What's on page 7?  I don't know.  I'm just picking one up right now.  Ah.  Page 7.  I see, uh, I see a steak.  I see, uh, meat.  Yeah, it's like bacon, meat, butter, flowers, herbs, grass.  How does the cat pee, it says.  What?  And then it says, no, really, cat pee. 
[03:20:00]  What do you mean?  Yeah.  It says cat pee.  How is that?  Some salving a block smells like cat piss.  What?  True.  Why is that?  It's just what it does.  In France, what they do for the American market is they put a bunch of cats in the tank.  They throw a whiz in there and they send it over and tell you it's good.  Come on.  No.  Come on.  You're, you're like a crazy person now.  Yeah.  No, it really smells like cat pee. 
[03:20:30]  It does.  Really?  And what, what is that that makes it smell like that?  I'm starting to smell it.  Yeah.  You know what?  You guys should actually test this out on your wife tomorrow.  You should bring home a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.  You know, get all fancy on her.  Stick your nose in it.  You know, just so she's feeling romantic.  Ask her if she smells the cat pee.  Wow.  Do it.  All right.  It'll be impressive.  Okay.  You'll make her laugh.  How will this scratch and sniff portion of the book help people?  How is that helping people with any type of wine selection or anything? 
[03:21:00]  That's a good question.  Yeah.  So everything we think we taste, we really actually smell.  We only taste sweet and sour and salty and bitter.  And if you're lucky, you taste duemame, too.  Uh-huh.  But everything else we think we taste, we're actually smelling.  So we.  And so that's why the scratch and sniff thing works.  Uh-huh.  Gotcha.  And so when you scratch and sniff your way through the book, you know what you like and  why you like it and therefore what you should drink.  How accurate are the sniff, scratch and sniffs in the book as to the real-life product? 
[03:21:30]  That's a very good question.  I know.  Yeah, I think it's very accurate.  And we've spent a lot of time working on this.  And the whole idea isn't to say, like, okay, this is a cherry and you knew it as a kid.  Uh-huh.  It's to evoke a memory.  You already know what a cherry tastes like.  And you know what a black grape tastes like.  Yes.  And so the idea is to get you thinking about what you like and what you don't like.  Right.  And that's what they do.  Do you remember the scratch and sniff Hustler back years ago? 
[03:22:00]  I do.  I remember Hustler put out a scratch and sniff of a vagina.  And I was actually, I was afraid to scratch and sniff.  Or Playgirl.  I was afraid.  Why were you afraid?  Well, I was afraid.  I was like, ah, I don't want to smell that.  Well, they used to make it sound like Vag.  I was 35 years old.  What do you think they used to make it smell like Vag in Hustle magazine?  They probably went to a hatchery and just dropped it in the water.  That reminds me, what wine goes with trout? 
[03:22:30]  Was that an inspiration to you when you came up with your scratch and sniff book?  Yeah, good question.  It was not an inspiration, but I wish I could find one of those.  Yeah, that'd be cool, right?  Got some of those around.  They never smelled good.  They never smelled like real Vag.  It was a perfume.  They always smelled like dirty Vag's.  It was a perfume smell.  It was, right?  That doesn't smell like really...  No.  No one perfumes that bad.  But if you got an older Hustle, it really smelled like just dirty, musky...  Oh, like a basement.  Yes. 
[03:23:00]  Let me go to Jake in Staten Island.  We're on with Richard Betts, who wrote a terrific book called The Essential Scratch and  Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert.  Wake my kids, Jake!  You can get through this very quickly.  This guy, being a smelling and tasting expert, I have a serious question.  I've taken some wine courses and some classes, and my question is, does pineapple actually  make my semen taste good?  Oh, does pineapple...  It's not a bad question.  I don't know.  It's crazy.  You have to ask your wife, I'm not sure.  Whoa! 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  There it is.  Oh, yeah.  There it is.  Richard O'Play.  Love it.  The zinger.  Right there.  Let me say hi to Mr. Doghead in South Plainfield, New Jersey.  Great.  Right down the old turnpike.  Mr. Doghead.  Yes, sir.  How are you guys doing this morning?  I have a question for Mr. Betts.  He's a true inspiration to me.  Oh, okay.  Hey, Mr. Betts, what...  You know, I'm thinking about writing a book myself about wine, and I just want to know if 
[03:24:00]  you have any tips for me.  Do you have any tips for you?  Keep it fun.  Keep it fun.  Keep it fun.  That's real sweet.  Fuck you, you pussy.  Oh, man.  Yes, dude.  What the...  That was just...  That was just mean.  The guy who answered your question, you just cursed at him?  That was just mean.  I'm sorry.  That was how I made a prank call, like, in 1980 when I was 12.  Yeah.  Then you quickly hang up because you're nervous.  Yeah.  I would call people and go, hi, are you home?  They'd go, yes.  And I'd go, I'm going to kill you.  And I'd hang up.  I'm not even kidding.  Richard, I got one problem with your book. 
[03:24:30]  What's that?  One simple word.  What?  Illiterate.  Whoa!  Damn.  The word is Kindle.  How do you do a scratch and sniff book if you read through your Kindle?  You know, it just doesn't matter.  You know, to Kindle, it just doesn't apply.  That's totally okay.  That's it.  You're just going to have to get on Amazon and buy it.  I would just gather up all the things in the book in real life. 
[03:25:00]  Right.  And then you have the Kindle, and then you could just smell them around you.  That'd be a little expensive.  Right.  Yeah.  But you could do it.  I don't understand.  Cat piss.  It's easy.  In the box.  I don't understand.  It says wine is a grocery, not a luxury.  What does that mean?  It means you should drink lots of it all the time.  Oh.  For special occasions.  Oh.  A lot of people do sex.  Wouldn't that make you an alcoholic, though?  No, it makes you fun. 
[03:25:30]  What?  I guess I should start drinking a lot of wine.  I think you should.  You guys need a wine sponsor for your show.  Do we?  Yeah.  Any sponsor for our show?  Yeah, that's true.  Catch a buzz.  Let's see what happens.  Catch a buzz.  We do tequila and donut day on this show, sir.  That's fun.  That's super fun.  When Billy Joel's scenes from an Italian restaurant comes up, do you just crank it?  Like, yeah.  My jam.  He's talking about me.  Yeah.  I like wine, and this song's about wine. 
[03:26:00]  I don't know, whatever kind of mood I'm in tonight.  That's right.  That's awesome.  No, as a matter of fact.  Oh.  You don't sing any karaoke?  Hey, guess what, though?  I have to sign off, because I have another one of you guys I have to talk to.  Another one of us guys.  What do you mean?  We're just all one together?  No radio show.  No radio show.  No radio show.  Oh.  We're not.  Yeah, no.  You know, we're people with feelings over here, sir.  What radio show?  Somewhere in Milwaukee.  Oh, that's beer capital right there.  You're going to have to sell them on wine.  Yeah, good luck with that.  Good luck.  I drink a lot of beer. 
[03:26:30]  Schlemiel Schlemazel, Hassan Pfeffer Incorporated, my friend.  That's the one.  Thank you for having me, guys.  Well, thank you, Richard Betts.  Thank you.  Yes.  All right.  Old.  What?  Tear it up.  Richard Betts.  Tear what up?  Your wife.  Your book?  Whoa!  Exactly.  Tear it up and make it fit.  Dickie Betts.  There's Dickie Betts.  Are you Dickie Betts from the Allman Brothers?  Richard Betts.  It's actually my mother's brother. 
[03:27:00]  Your mother's brother is Dickie Betts.  Yep.  That's pretty cool.  Wait, is that true?  Uh-huh.  Dude, I love the Allman Brothers.  Fuck the wine.  Let's talk Allman Brothers.  Sorry, guys.  I gotta go.  Oh, man.  How is that his mother's brother?  We were in Atlantic City, and he punched his wife in the face in a hotel room.  That's right.  He's probably drinking wine.  That went okay.  That was nice.  I realize as that's happening that I've just softened with age.  I can't be mean to people like I used to be. 
[03:27:30]  Aw, Jimmy.  That's adorable.  But no, it's not a moral judgment.  It's not like I'm a guy.  It's just, oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I cringe too fast now.  Yeah.  Aw.  Menopause.  Do you know what it is?  I think it is.  Menopause.  I hear you.  Yeah.  Eh, he's a nice enough guy.  I don't think any of us can be.  Just with a dream and a book for ten pages.  Yeah. 
[03:28:00]  He puts out a fun book.  You think Obi put the point across that his book was too short?  Yeah.  You think?  Yeah.  That brief book.  It's ten pages and there's not even, like, anything on each page.  My favorite way you told him his book was too short was when he went, let's go to page  ten, the last page.  Oh, that's the end of the book.  Oh, that's the end of the book.  Oops.  Yeah.  One page just has cartoon pictures of 16 noses. 
[03:28:30]  Noses on it.  And just a paragraph over here.  Right?  Look at this.  Yeah.  There's nothing to it.  That's really...  You think he's making a little shitload of money off this?  No.  Who's buying it?  How much is the book?  Oh.  Hmm.  $19.99.  Damn.  That's not unreasonable for a book.  I mean, uh...  That's probably why it's a few pages, though.  Well, they're thick pages to make it look like it might be 20 to 30 pages.  Yeah.  They're really thick pages.  Because it's cardboard. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  I guess you can't have a page that bends.  No.  Scratch and Sniff stickers on them.  Yeah.  You kind of have some substance to it.  A child's book.  That's it.  I swear to God I could bring this home.  Uh-huh.  And my kids would be fascinated by this.  Oh, you could just love it.  Because, look, it's very colorful.  That spells out fruit with actual fruit.  Scratch and Sniff factor.  You know what?  I'm going to bring it home, and I'll have a...  Right.  I'll have an update tomorrow.  Uh-huh.  Very good.  They're going to love this.  Let us know.  I'll tell them to scratch some shit. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  Scratch this.  Smell it.  Ew.  It smells like Daddy's sweatpants.  It's a snow.  It's a snow day, too, so this won't take up a half hour.  Oh, man.  Well, you just got to find things that take time.  Is that your mission today?  Today's definitely babysitting.  Damn.  You got to occupy them constantly?  All day now.  All day long.  All day long.  And you can't go out because it's shitty sideways snow, so you can't even slide down a hill or 
[03:30:00]  nothing.  Today's supposed to be my big dentist day.  Yeah.  They called me yesterday and said, you know, weather permitting.  Oh, forget it.  I don't need weather.  I need my teeth.  You should never have to yell that.  No.  Jesus.  All right.  We're going to take a break and regroup with some other shit.  Right.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony will be right back.

[03:36:00]  Is he on your bowl bag?  No, no, he's walking back.  Come on, get back.  They're trying to get stung in the balls by a wasp.  They're attempting.  The wasp is disappointing them by his lack of willingness to sting their testicles.  Can I have the jars?  When you're done, I'm making jelly later.  Sure, but I'll sign my jar for you after the show.  There we go.  Oh, oh.  Is he up on your sack?  He's right under my fucking sack.  Oh, God damn.  These wasps suck.  What are you doing, bro?  Oh, he's really just fucking up the wasps. 
[03:36:30]  Oh, God, he's shaking it up.  Why doesn't it be on their backs so that the boss fall onto him?  Good point.  You know what, Bill?  You raised an excellent point.  Someone quick, up on the console on your back.  Fuck it.  I'm not kidding.  All right, what does he got?  What do you got?  These are four.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Jesus!  Jesus Christ!  Oh!  What?  Oh!  Holy shit!  Hey, uh...  Holy shit! 
[03:37:00]  Hey, champ!  That came out of nowhere!  Hey, champ, why don't you take that one?  Holy crap!  Wait, no, no, Paul.  Leave it like that, Paul.  Champ!  Holy shit!  Why don't you take that one?  He's obviously a fucking...  He's no longer playing games.  I see him jump into me!  Holy shit!  Wait, wait, wait, he pops into the top.  Wait, where's that...  Not yet!  What do you want me to do?  Where's that last jar?  That's what I'm getting in.  Oh, there you go.  Okay, he's got...  Now he's got the pissed-off wasp.  He's got the pissed-off wasp.  You want to go for the four paper wasps?  Sure!  This is four.  That one wasp is being really pissed. 
[03:37:30]  This wasp has a taste for it now.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  No.  That's how it works.  God damn it, no, not that jar!  Not the nest.  Plug it up.  That thing is gonna...  Nest!  Nest!  Nest!  Nest!  Nest!  Oh, God, I'm petrified with a wasp nest.  We got a minute.  We only have a minute left in the show.  A minute left in the show.  Oh, he's going with the entire wasp nest.  A minute left in the show.  Can we go a little long?  Is it possible to...  No, we can't go long?  No, it cuts off and it'll go right to...  All right, we got a minute 15. 
[03:38:00]  Matt has put the jar that has the nest of bees.  Don't drop it if you get stung.  Don't drop it.  Holy shit.  Jump up and down.  Jump up and down.  This is the grand finale.  Matt!  Woo!  The current ball champion.  He has his balls for the wasp nest.  He's got his balls in a jar that has a little wasp nest.  Wow.  Anything?  50 seconds.  They're on it.  Here they come.  They're on it.  They're on it.  Here they come.  Oh, shit.  Here they come.  We have 40 seconds left in the show. 
[03:38:30]  He is basically shaking the jar upside down right onto his nutsack.  Oh, god damn it.  You put the entire nest against his sack.  Oh, my God.  The whole nest is a great sack.  The whole nest is a great sack.  30 seconds left in the show.  What courage.  30 seconds.  The cameras are rolling.  Oh, my God.  This is for the title, Matt.  You are a madman.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[03:39:00]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  And now he's coming over here slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now because here comes Uncle Paul. 
[03:39:30]  Let me show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers babysitting a young Opie.  You remember.  I used to babysit you.  I'd poke my you-know-what through the crib and you'd grab it.  He was a little blue-eyed Gregorio.  He was the cutest one.  Yeah.  I told you.  Him and his brother would play the game.  The peenie flip.  I'd say, go ahead.  Flip your peenie.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:40:00]  Sure.  And his mother would take pictures.  Take pictures when he was in the tub.  Yeah.  And then the court said she had to leave.  So she went with a Jewish fella.  I kiss his shoulders real tender.  And I say, this is what happens.  The man puts it in.  I'm going to fertilize you.  I'm going to show you how we start life.  Push back a little bit.  Come on, eat your ice cream and push back.  Show Uncle Paul you want a baby.  I'm going to make you pregnant.  Who's that old guy over there? 
[03:40:30]  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now.  Cause here comes Uncle Paul.  Clean the bowl with your sock.  Opie and Anthony are back. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, I still use the sock.  Yeah, yeah?  Oh, I love it.  It's perfect.  The old piss sock.  The old piss sock.  Instead of bending down, you've used that sock foot.  Oh, wow.  Get rid of a...  Some dribbles.  Some dribbles.  Don't forget, our 40th podcast is out.  40th?  Go through iTunes, I guess, cause it helps our numbers, I've been told.  Yeah, you bastards. 
[03:41:30]  For bragging rights, go to iTunes.  In the end, I guess we just want you to go get it.  But, if you go through iTunes, it helps us with bragging rights.  With all the big boys that are podcasting.  And that's what we want.  Of course.  Bragging rights.  Of course we do.  Indeed.  Podcast number 40.  Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan on the same podcast, on the same show.  That was a classic.  It's not two separate segments.  It's those two guys together.  Yeah.  Come on.  It was great.  You're not going to want to miss that.  Absolutely.  So, yeah. 
[03:42:00]  iTunes is where we want you to mostly go.  But if you don't do it that way, just go get it another way.  That's fine.  Yeah.  But if you have a choice, pick iTunes.  All right?  Right.  Okay.  It's snowing.  Yeah, it's snowing like a mofo.  Yeah.  A mofo.  It's snowing very hard and sideways.  Yeah.  And I guess New York City, they're not really closing the schools.  No, they really stopped closing schools.  Well...  I don't know what it is.  The public schools in New York City?  Like, no. 
[03:42:30]  They're open.  Well, de Blasio's reasoning...  Uh-huh.  You know, the kids get at least one warm meal if they go to school.  He loves a good...  They don't want to take the warm meal away from the kids.  He always said that?  Yeah.  That's what I've been told.  Yeah.  That's his logic.  A lot of people really depend on that warm meal at school.  Maybe that's the excuse he gives for keeping the school...  Like, maybe it's better to keep them open now, and then they say, well, how could you  do that?  Like, you're risking them. 
[03:43:00]  He's like, well, they get at least a warm meal.  I think...  Maybe it's a counterbalance.  I believe so, because there's no way schools should be open today.  This is a real snow day for New York City, especially.  Yeah, yeah.  It's crazy out there.  Yeah.  You should have school buses on the road.  It's sideways.  What's that, Sam?  You got other school closings?  Yeah, we have a whole batch of school closings that decided to get creative with their recorded  messages.  Ooh.  So what is this?  They put out recorded messages, and you go to the site and see if your school is open 
[03:43:30]  or closed?  Some of it's just audio, so I'm assuming that's like a phone call that you call a line to see  if your school's open.  But a couple of them are like YouTube videos or Facebook videos that these schools put out,  and they decided to get creative and song parodies and things like that.  I want to explain that there's no school.  Okay.  Do you want to listen to a couple of them?  More than I want to.  I don't know if we want to listen to a couple.  We'll listen to one, and then decide.  How about like two songs, but I got a few? 
[03:44:00]  Like two chains.  Oh.  What about Pitbull, though?  I hate Pitbull.  Love the Pitbull.  I do too.  The Fat Boys.  Amazing.  Fat Boys.  Let's hear the first one.  All right.  The first one is coming out of Carroll County, Georgia.  Okay.  And this is a phone message that parents and students...  Where the big boss man was from?  No, he's Cobb County.  Oh, see, I thought...  No, Cobb County.  Cobb County.  Where's that again?  Georgia.  Oh, man.  I wonder how the boss man's doing with all this snow.  Wow.  That's true.  Anywhere we can get in touch... 
[03:44:30]  You know that this guy's over at WWE.  I want to make sure the boss man's okay.  Can you touch with the big boss man?  You'd have to do it through an episode of The Twilight Zone.  Why?  What do you mean?  He's deceased.  He's buried in the ground.  What?  He looked so healthy.  Well, he was not as old as some people get, but he's dead.  Oh, man.  He's dead.  He was older than he looked?  No.  He wasn't.  He was as old as he looked, and then he died.  Well, how old was he?  He was in his...  Probably 40s.  Oh, Jesus.  I used to love the big boss man. 
[03:45:00]  He'd come out with that angry face and his billy club.  And you know that was the real guy, too.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, he looks all nice right there.  Right.  He looks healthy there, Sam.  Right?  He's only 41.  It must have been an accident then.  Oh, that's tragic.  Yeah.  Was it a car accident, or...?  Well, he was...  When he was 41.  Yeah.  He had a heart attack and died.  What?  He was how old?  41. 
[03:45:30]  Jesus.  Oh, Jesus.  He looked older than 41.  He did.  Well...  Is That a Train on Twitter says,  OB Radio, it has nothing to do with a hot meal.  I did hear that, though, where they get a hot meal.  Oh, you said.  You didn't say, bet on this.  That's being the right answer.  You didn't say, take this to the bank.  Right.  And so the Board of Ed gets credit for a school day for their federal funding.  Yeah.  All right.  Fucking...  I fucked Ed.  He's pretty boring.  Hmm?  I'm school closing.  I have to fucking call me a... 
[03:46:00]  You're a thinker.  I do a thinker.  What the fuck?  So this message was left on...  So what?  The kids call to see if they have school and they hear this?  No.  They actually call the students with this message.  Oh, that's how they do it nowadays?  Like, every student got this phone call.  Fuck, you don't even have to listen to the radio or anything?  They call you?  Yeah.  How great is that?  Here it is.  It's from Carroll County. 
[03:46:30]  It's where the big...  Nope.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Fuck yeah.  Okay.  Yo, IES.  Let's tighten up.  Ice, ice, baby.  Uh-oh.  Ice, ice, baby.  Bye-bye.  All right, start.  Stay at home and listen.  Ice is back and with some mission.  Snowing.  Better wrap up tightly.  No school tomorrow.  I say rightly.  Will we ever go? 
[03:47:00]  Yo, I don't know.  Later tonight, we'll get more snow.  To the extreme.  I cancel school like a vandal.  Check out Emoto for a homework you can handle.  Ice, ice, baby.  Wow.  I like this better than 2 Chainz.  That's true.  Oh, they're having a little fun.  A little fun.  Just having a little fun.  Nice.  I don't know if anyone noticed, but you hear it went dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. 
[03:47:30]  We have another one?  Yeah, in Durham, North Carolina.  This is the head of school and assistant head of school  with a video message telling students to stay home.  All right, let's do this.  All right.  Okay.  Oh, he's putting on a ski goggles. 
[03:48:00]  The other guy's got an American black kind of Olympic jacket on.  All right, stop.  Collaborate and listen.  Ice is back and the roads will glisten.  Polar vortex has a hold of us tightly.  Win like a harpoon daily and nightly.  Will the power stop?  No, I don't know.  Turn up the heat and let go. 
[03:48:30]  Sleep falling down like a million missiles.  Bring in school delays and early dismissals.  Dance!  To the grocery store up my batteries before conditions become deadly.  Slippy roads might be, so stay in your house and drink hot tea.  Don't worry, kids, the learning's not lost.  We have Evernote, Moodle, and they're across.  If there's a problem, revision will solve it.  Check out a boat while the ice dissolves it.  Ice, ice, baby.  Uh-huh.  No school there.  Ice, ice, baby.  No school there.  Does anyone have an original thought anymore? 
[03:49:00]  This is terrible.  So what?  One school decided to do this and they all said, oh, wow, we fucking gotta do this.  Well, it's only two schools.  Oh, that's right.  All right, two is up.  Is that what happened?  That's fine.  Can you imagine educators when you were growing up like this?  Doing that?  What?  No!  I couldn't imagine old pistol Pete Polina getting on some kind of media and doing a little song  and dance number.  Unless he was doing a little song and dance number on your face for being late.  Let me tell you, he was a strict guy.  Yeah. 
[03:49:30]  Old Gil Lilienthal.  He wouldn't have been doing that.  No.  We had a stupid gym teacher that would, did I tell a story?  He would just break stopwatches because he would get so angry at us.  Wow, that's funny.  So we didn't line up properly or do the exercise properly.  Throw the stopwatch down and break it.  All dramatically.  Did you look at him really kind of just seriously and go, do you know how immature that is?  We just looked at him like, what's wrong with you?  What are you doing?  We weren't scared or anything.  We just felt like douche chills.  Like, who gives a fuck?  It's Jim. 
[03:50:00]  Jesus.  Is that it, then?  There's two.  I guess that's it.  No, that was two.  I can't believe it's a coincidence that two schools would do that.  Lexington, South Carolina.  I like South Carolina.  Right.  This is White Knoll.  South Carolina.  Rise up.  That's right.  I remember that.  Petey Pablo.  This is home of the game.  Gamecocks.  Run over your head.  Right.  Take off your fucking bandana.  Right.  Spin it over your head like a motherfucking helicopter.  This is White Knoll Elementary School.  Uh-huh.  All right.  They'll at least use a different song, I'm sure. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Let it snow.  Let it snow.  Yo, APs.  Let's kick it.  Ice.  Ice.  Oh, Jesus.  Ice.  Ice, baby.  All right, stop.  Wake up and listen.  Ice is back in the road.  No.  No.  The weatherman sounds all frightful.  He says he's going to ice daily.  This guy isn't even on the mark.  No.  Turn off the lights and I'll go back to sleep and I'll study like a vandal.  If the lights go out, then I'll light up a candle. 
[03:51:00]  School messages.  Very dangerous.  Miss Hill will call you, send you an email, tweet, and poke to.  Donuts for Dad.  We are postponing.  We'll have it next week.  He's not even trying.  No, he's not.  This guy is worse than two chains.  You know what, though?  Good for him.  Because some asshole said, look, this is how we're going to do.  Read this.  Yeah.  Right.  All right.  That's good.  We're done.  Wow.  Well, you're right.  Terrible.  That's the end of Ice Ice Baby.  Okay.  Shoof.  But there's no reason we shouldn't find out what's happening in Stevens, Kentucky.  Stevens, Kentucky. 
[03:51:30]  They got snow, too, huh?  The elementary school, yeah, is dealing with it.  And what happens here?  We just got a call.  Breaking news.  School is closed.  School is closed.  Sorry, parents, for another day.  Watch out.  We're frustrating.  Very, very frightening.  School is canceled.  School is canceled.  School is canceled.  School is canceled.  Because it's cold.  So everyone grab a Snuggie and watch TV.  Oh, my fucking God.  Sounds like a man. 
[03:52:00]  What a bunch of chodes.  They are chodes.  Everyone wants to be famous.  The school administrators just want to get out there and get on video.  The school administrators.  That was good.  All right.  We're done, I guess.  All right.  Let's just find out what's going on in DeKalb County, Alabama.  How many more of these do we have?  The boss man was from? 
[03:52:30]  That's, no.  That's, no.  Where was he from?  Cobb County, Georgia.  Didn't you just say that?  Yeah.  I said DeKalb County, Alabama.  Sorry.  How's he doing?  He's dead.  Oh, we went over that.  All right.  This is another announcement from your local superintendent, Hugh Taylor.  A DeKalb County bus won't come down your street.  The weather's pretty bad, so settle back into your seat.  There won't be a bus, so don't you wait. 
[03:53:00]  Our driver's sleeping, and it won't get up until late.  Oh, my God.  Save our land.  Join the Klan.  That's what that guy sounds like, huh?  You don't have to go.  School of Kansas, you don't have to go.  What song is this?  I still can't figure out what song they're playing.  I have no idea.  Oh, okay.  No kids in class, we have empty seats.  No kids in class, we have empty seats.  Ooh, don't look for a school bus, a county school bus. 
[03:53:30]  School's canceled.  Ooh, don't look for a school bus, a county school bus.  School bus.  A school bus.  It sounds like he was drinking and then playing with the voicemail system at the school.  Yes, yes.  Why would a superintendent ever think it appropriate?  Or any attendant for that matter.  That's right.  You don't have to be super.  No.  That was horrible.  Why would any administrator think like, oh yeah, I'll just sing a song? 
[03:54:00]  They did that when I was younger, though.  No, they didn't.  Yeah, they did.  They did not.  They would actually.  Hey!  Bless you, Danny.  Dude, I had to have sprayed.  Did you sneeze all over?  Jimmy just sneezed all over himself.  I didn't mean to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's another one?  Well, let's stop by Green County, Kentucky.  What?  How many more of these?  That's where the Honky Tonk Man was from?  All right.  Good.  Honky Tonk Man is alive.  Oh.  Holy shit.  Call the press.  We found one that's alive.  The Honky Tonk Man. 
[03:54:30]  No skull.  I'll have a blue Monday without you.  School's canceled on.  I'll be so blue.  They're holding off signs.  No school Monday, February 10th.  Just thinking all about you.  The superintendent of schools is singing.  So get out your soul. 
[03:55:00]  Slay or just play in the van.  All right.  Don't be disappointed.  If we're still here in June, I'll have a blue.  Still going.  Just say school's canceled.  Yeah, exactly.  That's why people hate teachers.  I just remember sitting by the window with the radio on. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah, of course.  It's like, and the Elwood School District.  Yeah.  And I'm like, yes.  My school always stayed open for whatever fucking reason.  Maybe it was for the hot news.  I remember the list.  Probably.  That's what I heard somewhere.  Yeah.  The whole list.  They're like, why us?  Why are we staying open?  The rest of Long Island is closed.  They actually hired me to do celebrity impressions for these messages.  Did they?  Do we have any of that?  You just call up and do celebrity voices about school being closed? 
[03:56:00]  Yeah.  You got one?  Yeah.  What celebrity do you want?  I mean, there's...  Oh, you could just, like, pick one?  I'm not saying that.  I'm just saying that the ones I've done are varied.  Brendan Fraser.  I didn't do him.  Oh.  Copyrighted, Fringerman.  How about...  But you do everyone else.  Let me hear a school closing message from none other than Jack Nicholson.  Oh, that was actually a weird one.  It was a phone ring and you go, here's school closing. 
[03:56:30]  Uh-huh.  You don't have to get up and go to school today.  All right.  Then how about a school closing from Gary Sinise?  Uh, uh, hi.  Yeah, it's stormy.  I have no legs and I fell in the water.  You don't have to go to school, especially if either you're retarded or your wife has AIDS.  How about a school closing from Johnny Carson?  Ah, I think I'll take Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday off. 
[03:57:00]  Off.  She's brilliant.  It really is, man.  That's really something.  I just want to tell.  Oh, Christopher Walken.  Yeah.  How was that?  Oh!  Go ahead, stay home!  What about one from Bob Backlund?  Oh, wow.  I would like...  Ah, that's the knee walk.  I'm too tired from knee walk and school's closed. 
[03:57:30]  Knee walk.  It's good, right?  Yeah, it's really good.  What about the big boss man?  How would he sound?  Just silent.  Oh, he's dead.  Oh, boy.  What about, does Colin Quinn do one?  Ah, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  The school's closed.  I'm going to go learn going to school.  By the way, that song was Word Up by Cameo.  I knew it sounded like something.

[04:05:30]  my son likes it better  if he's 64 and living in Hollywood  even being a school teacher  there's pressure out there  for you all  to be beautiful  it's all too much  I can't  so he's probably  like you know  he's been trapped  in that marriage  with that woman  for those years  anyway  she's got  the latest picture  of Bruce Jenner  and his hair is even longer  and ladylike  than the one we saw  just the other day  yeah  why wouldn't you say  why wouldn't you just go  look idiots  I'm not trying to be a woman

[04:06:30]  but men seem to get  more effeminate  in the face  when they get things done  like when you all  get your nose jobs  you can't get your nose  pinched too small  and when you go  for your filler  how do you breathe  through a pinched nose  I could never do  why are they pinching  the nose  I'm so glad my nose  is perfect  I don't want my nose  pinched  yeah they pinch it down  like the Michael Jackson  surgery  everyone pinched their nose  like why would you want it  most of my day doing that  mine hurts  and snot would come out  ew  oh god  what are you doing

[04:09:00]  What to do  Wave your hands in the air  Like you don't care  Glide by the people  As they start to look at their  Do your dance  Do your dance  Do your dance  Why do you superimpose his face on wild dogs?  That's pretty cool.  It looks like the fucking thing, the John Copper diversion.  It kind of looks like Tim Tebow as a dog.  Anyone else see that?  Tim Tebow. 
[04:09:30]  I think this was their way of competing with rock rap.  I don't mind that.  What year is that?  It's alright.  Probably like the late 90s.  That's not bad for that song.  As a cover for that dumb song.  It feels like somebody competing with Limp Bizkit.  Faith is better.  Faith?  That was great when Limp Bizkit put that out.  People make fun of Limp Bizkit, but that version of Faith is ridiculous.  What was that?  That was when they were cool.  Let's hear it. 
[04:10:00]  You've never heard Limp Bizkit do Faith?  I may have.  Oh, that one, yeah.  You won't like it.  Holy fuck.  Was it Wham or was it George Michael's on his own face?  George Michael.  George Michael's song.  Yeah, this was post-Bush's.  This fucking thing.  And if Fred Durst weren't such a douche, it'd be like, this would still hold up.  Right.  But it's hard to get away from that.  Yeah, they just don't like Fred Durst as a person.  Do you think he's hardcore?  Do you think he's hardcore?  If I could touch your body.  I know not everybody has got a body like me. 
[04:10:30]  But I gotta think twice.  Before I give my heart away.  And I know all the games you play.  Cause I play them too.  Oh, but I need some time off.  From that emotion.  Here we go.  Strap in, kids.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, it gets really heavy.  Like, ridiculously heavy.  Oh, oh, there he goes. 
[04:11:00]  Oh, man.  Look at the audience just going bullshit.  Fred Durst.  Look at that crowd, though.  Fuck.  How did Fred Durst turn into such a douche so fast?  Cause he was fucking awesome when this song came out.  What happened here?  Why is the perception of this guy that he's a douche?  He beloved Fred Durst.  He got too big, too fast. 
[04:11:30]  And he came out with Nookie, So You Could Take the Cookie.  And that song got so big, it just destroyed him.  Nookie, So You Can Take the Cookie?  What the fuck does that mean?  Stick it up your hay.  Stick it up your hay.  Stick it up your hay.  Stick it up your hay.  Hey, he was there for one of our benchmark bits, too.  What bit?  The turkey bit, man.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  He was in The Rock Boss when we were getting fucking attacked.  Oh.  He's one of the least cool people. 
[04:12:00]  He's on Billy Ray Cyrus level.  Is he still trying to do it?  He pops up every now and then.  He's in our city, obviously, with Billy Ray Cyrus.  Man, the 90s had a sound.  He's like the end of the 90s.  Yeah, yeah.  This is really the end of the 90s, right here. 
[04:12:30]  Jesus.  That's pretty fucking cool.  Oh, boy.  Those 90s were a pisser, weren't they?  That was a turkey thing we should talk about.  Turkey foot?  I was playing turkey foot.  We come up with this bit to just fuck over the entire audience.  I'm surprised Dave Douglas allowed us to do it.  No, guys.  And we found a field. 
[04:13:00]  We promoted, like, for a while that for Thanksgiving you could catch your own turkey.  And PETA was all over us, remember?  Yeah, bring whatever.  PETA was always all over us.  Because we were saying, bring whatever weapons you want.  Right.  So we're like, look, you can't bring guns, but you can bring anything else you want to  catch these, you know, turkeys for Thanksgiving.  The key is we never said live turkeys, but we just kept saying.  And people would call.  Remember, we would just take call after call.  Could I bring a nut?  Yeah, man.  Baseball bat?  Yep.  Sure. 
[04:13:30]  That's on the list.  Put a spike through it.  Right.  All sorts of fucking things.  And then people were calling up with creative, like, things they were building to catch their turkeys  and stuff.  It really was a huge bit for us at the time.  So then we pulled the rock bus into this open field.  I'm trying to remember where.  Somewhere in, like, Framingham area, I guess.  And...  Did they show up with weapons and basins?  Dude, I swear they did.  And I would love, if anyone out there, any of the old timers have pictures of that event,  I would love to see them.  And I would love to hear the broadcast. 
[04:14:00]  I don't even know if...  I don't even took pictures back then.  I know.  They didn't take as many pictures.  And I would love to hear the broadcast.  I don't even know if the broadcast holds up.  But then Fred Durst was there.  We had to do an interview with Fred Durst, like, just before it or in the middle of it  or something like that.  Anyway, long story short, we lined everybody up with their homemade weapons and all sorts  of crazy shit.  They had lacrosse sticks, if you remember, and hockey sticks.  A lot of weaponry.  And we encouraged them to bring the weapons when we realized these guys were really into it.  Anyway, so we sent them out on the field. 
[04:14:30]  They're like, where are the turkeys?  And we're like, oh, they're way the fuck out there.  They're kind of hiding.  They're scared, you know?  So they went running out.  And long story short, we placed paper turkeys in the fields and behind bushes and rocks  and behind trees and whatnot.  And you could exchange it for a frozen turkey.  Was the bit in the end.  Yeah.  But we didn't feel like telling them any of that shit.  You guys love to trick people in those days.  Oh, a lot of trickery going.  A lot of tricksters.  I still love it.  It's just a lot harder to do these days. 
[04:15:00]  People are a little more savvy.  Oh, yeah.  So then, I'll never forget, I remember, like, the first realization by these listeners  that they were kind of had, but they weren't because they were still getting shit for it.  And they found the paper turkey.  And then the guy lifts it up like, what the fuck?  And had the realization like, we just fucked them.  Yeah, because they didn't get to kill something.  And then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, they all started running back toward the rock bus.  And they fucking did, how much damage do you remember? 
[04:15:30]  It was real shit.  They started using their weapons, hitting it.  Hitting the rock bus.  They were throwing rocks at it.  And I think there was snow on the ground at the time.  Snowballs, rocks, fucking their weapons.  Then they start shaking the thing.  They were fucking pissed.  They just had all their turkey-killing aggression that they had to get out on somebody?  Yeah, yeah.  They were going to cave in some turkey skulls.  And then we took that away from them.  And then we're there, like, we're born.  No, no, no.  The paper turkeys, you get a real turkey.  And I think we threw in some other stuff.  I don't remember exactly.  They didn't care. 
[04:16:00]  They didn't give a fuck.  And I remember we...  They wanted to kill.  And they were breaking the windows of the rock bus.  So I remember at one point, we were actually under the broadcast table until we could figure out  our bearings.  They had to take cover.  Like, how bad is this going to get?  And then we realized we were sort of okay.  Were you scared?  Um, slightly, I guess.  I didn't need the real answer.  Slightly.  I didn't think they'd kill us.  I didn't, yeah, but I...  I think they were just vandalizing.  Yeah, but I wasn't sure if I was going to get a rock to the head through the window or something at first.  Shards of glass being...  Yeah.  Pelted your way. 
[04:16:30]  But anyway, Fred Durst was there for that big, you know, benchmark event.  What year was that?  And he turned into a dick.  Ninety...  I don't know how that happened to Fred Durst.  I'd guess 96, 97-ish.  97, probably.  Is that that Christina Aguilera thing?  Maybe it was the Christina Aguilera.  I think, yeah, it was...  What did he do with her?  Two things.  It was Eminem making fun of him.  Yeah, because Eminem had all the cred.  Right.  Right.  And he would only make fun of boy banders.  So when he made fun of Fred Durst, it was like...  And then he came out with the nookie and the cookie.  Well, how did that go? 
[04:17:00]  The nookie and the cookie?  And that song...  That song was so huge.  But it was catchy as all hell.  Of course.  But it really fucked up his credibility.  It was like the song of the year.  And people wouldn't, you know, let him live it down.  It turned on him.  Why does that shit turn on people if they have a massive over-the-top hit?  I don't know, because everybody likes it at first, but I guess then they just get sick  of it and then they get resentful of it.  Burnt out.  It gets burnt out.  Yeah, play a little bit.  I don't know.  I'm sure I've heard of this dumbness.  Oh, man. 
[04:17:30]  Here's the fucking video.  Chicks.  Oh, man.  They were always cool to us.  I don't have anything bad to say about Fred Durst, actually.  I've never met him.  We did a lot of things with him over, like, a two-year period when we were up in Boston. 
[04:18:00]  That asshole.  With his dumb black eyes.  What's his name?  Wes Borland?  Is that it?  Oh, wow.  Very good.  He tried to do his own thing, right?  Yeah.  Good luck with that.  I was a Limp Bizkit fan in the beginning.  But I turned on him like everybody else.  Hey!  Oh, he's going to do it all for the...  All the chicks are like, yo, let me follow Fred Durst.  Yeah, that's the chicks.  But they're shitty girls, though.  You notice that?  They're just, like...  They're just okay. 
[04:18:30]  But they were hotter at the time.  Oh, is that what's going on there, you think?  This is fucking cornball city.  You think so?  Yes!  You know when they get to the streets?  Oh, cornball fucking city.  Here it comes, Jim.  Pick it up your yeah.  Pick it up your yeah.  Come on, look, lookie.  Come on, so you can take that cookie and think it's a ghost. 
[04:19:00]  Pick it up your yeah.  Let's know what my...  Why?  This is fucking...  I'm cringing.  Jimmy, you just don't know good shit, yo.  Word.  Yeah.  No, but I do know shit.  Fuck yeah.  Hey.  This is the type of music Jim would make.  Hey. 
[04:19:30]  Yeah.  The winter coat.  Yeah.  Why is he wearing a winter coat in summer?  I don't know.  Some of the girls are wearing baby tees and tank tops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  I hate the dance they do, the jump dance.  Is that Queens?  Is this something Queens?  That's it.  Or Brooklyn or something, right?  Maybe Brooklyn.  No, that looks more like Queens.  You're right.  That kind of looks like Queens. 
[04:20:00]  The start of Queens.  We're sort of warehouse-y and then turns into kind of...  Scott Shannon not retiring, by the way.  I heard.  Where's he going to be?  I don't know.  They must have been falling out.  I have a feeling he's going to be right here at SiriusXL.  He might be right.  Satellite Radio.  We're back here.  We're favorable before.  That won't be uncomfortable.  We're favorable.  Wow.  That won't be uncomfortable.  Are you kidding me?  I'd live for that.  I'm getting hurt.  I can't wait.  Yes?  Yes.  Long Island City was the film location. 
[04:20:30]  Oh.  That's Queens.  That's Queens.  What are you fucking doing?  That's Queens.  We figured it out.  I said the beginning of Queens.  Yeah.  Long Island City.  We wish I learned a lot from you.  Nookie and the cookie.  It looks like those warehouses where, what's his name, had that SiriusXM equipment warehouse  thing.  What was his name?  Yeah.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  The old Ziggy.  Yeah.  It looks exactly like that.  Does he still have one?  Ziggy was in Long Island City.  Yeah.  That's exactly where that was.  Does he still have that stuff?  No.  I think he sold all that off. 
[04:21:00]  Why?  Because you don't.  He did it for the Nookie.  Right.  So you can take that cookie.  That's where young Hendry was selling the cigarettes in Goodfellas.  Oh.  Out of the back of the truck was that area right there.  Yeah.  That's probably during this video.  Yeah.  We're going to buy some Ziggy's.  Hey.  Hey.  Take that Ziggy and stick it up, yo.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, why don't we get to the next issue of that fucking show?  Oh, man.  Well, there's a new one on Sunday.  Why do we have to wait?  We shouldn't have to wait. 
[04:21:30]  Like we're some average schnook.  What do we?  That's Roro.  Yo, Roro.  Where's Roland?  We're sick.  We're on the mountain.  Sick, really?  Yes.  How about that hunk of shit that says that?  Hey.  I'm going to do a fake sick, sir.  Are you?  Yeah.  Everyone else does this.  What the fuck don't I do a fake sick?  You think Roland's faking it?  Of course.  I'm fucking sick.  Remember Mars?  Remember Mars?  Who's Mars?  Another fake sick guy?  Who is fake sick?  I don't know who you're talking about.  I hear he's coming back Monday, finally.  He's a little, I think he was Mexican. 
[04:22:00]  I literally didn't notice he was gone.  Who did?  Oh, wow.  He's gone for like a month.  Yeah.  The guitar player left for another band, and that's why Limp Bizkit fell apart?  Not really.  I mean, they were...  The signs were already there, and Wes decided, you know what, maybe the...  He saw the swines?  I saw the swines.  Opened up his eyes, he saw the swines.  Then Wes came back, though.  They were playing that song in Wawa the other day.  Yeah.  When I was down in Philly, and I just started laughing at myself.  Yeah.  And the real version of that song is really bad, too. 
[04:22:30]  What?  Really?  Yes.  It's worse.  You could hear the swines in the original, too.  Let me hear that.  No way.  Or maybe my brain is just fucking poisoned now with that song.  No, I can't.  Every time I hear it, I have to sing it.  Let me hear it, because I heard this, and I'm like, it's not much better than the version  we have.  I have to sing it like she's saying it when I...  Jimmy, you like this video?  I love it.  I love her rendition of this. 
[04:23:00]  See the...  Who is that?  Ace of Face.  Are they the original?  Yes.  Oh, man.  She has hair like Marky Post.  Yes.  Dumb fucking face moles.  She said, Rick, who knows me?  Here we go. 
[04:23:30]  Can you hear it a little bit?  So...  Oh, her fucking hand movements are enraging.  I think I'm poisoned.  Yeah.  It's a catchy tune, though, isn't it?  It is, right?  Yes, it is.  Let me hear the whisper.  You know, she might have nailed this.  I got a request for our video people out there that are syncing up our shit lately, and they're 
[04:24:00]  doing a great job.  Really, really a great job.  There's a few of you out there.  Could someone please take the ice pool of the sign girl from our show and sync it up to  the actual Ace of Base video?  That would be great.  But you got to send it to me.  That one I want on my fucking channel, please.  But I'll give you a nice little plug.  Because that would be hilarious to see it synced up to the actual video.  No?  Saw the Soins?  Yes.  All right.  Someone do that for me, please. 
[04:24:30]  Saw the Soins.  The guy's skipping around going, without understanding, you know, I saw the Soins.  Yeah.  And you tore up into...  All right.  Now I got to hear it.  You got any?  Who's got it?  Travis got it?  You got it, Trav.  Hit it.  Start this over.  See if you can sync it up first.  I love this.  Oh, yeah.  Let's try to sync it up ourselves.  Let's see what it would look like.  Hold on.  Okay.  What?  Travis, where's your start again?  At the beginning.  I have the full song. 
[04:25:00]  All right.  You guys start at the same time.  Let's say one, two, three, and we'll do it.  All right.  Ready?  One, two...  Hold on.  I don't want to blow it.  Three.  I saw it.  What'd you see?  I saw it.  Uh-oh.  I think we're off. 
[04:25:30]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  We could do this.  All right.  How do we do this?  We're almost there.  Hang on.  Just let...  You got it on pause where you are?  No, I'm going to start it over.  What?  No. 
[04:26:00]  What?  I need some lyric.  You go to the first I saw the sign.  Okay.  Travis, please.  And then, Sam, you find the first I saw the signs.  And then at least we get...  Is my computer on?  Yes.  And then both kill yourselves.  Okay.  All right.  Hold on.  No, no, Travis, but stop it right before...  No, no, wait, no.  Stop it.  I didn't know what happened.  No, what is it?  You're right, but stop it, Sam.  You got to...  Sinking stuff is so fucking frustrating. 
[04:26:30]  No, no, no, you're letting it go.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Right, boom.  Perfect.  All right, wait.  No.  No, no, stop it.  All right, there it is.  It stopped at I.  All right, I, I.  Okay.  So who stopped at the first...  I did.  Travis, all right.  Now, are you stopped at the first I?  Hang on.  You got to go back.  There's enough in my eyes all the time.  It opened up my eyes all the time.  Life is demanding without understanding.  I still can't. 
[04:27:00]  You've opened up my eyes all the time.  No one's gonna drag you up.  This is so visual.  Yeah.  It'll work, though.  I just got to hear her singing. 
[04:27:30]  She must hate this.  There's enough in my eyes all the time.  There's enough in my eyes all the time.  Life is demanding without understanding.  There's enough in my eyes all the time.  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong. 
[04:28:00]  But where do you belong?  That's one of my favorite bits of audio ever.  It's the greatest thing that was ever put on tape from this program.  Somebody please sync this up for me.  Send it to me.  I've got to put it on my YouTube.  She is so fucking fantastic.  Add some of the original Ace of Base song just to pump it up a bit.  I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes.  I am happy not living without you. 
[04:28:30]  Why is she going to be here?  Why is she going to be here?  I am happy not living without you.  Oh, oh, oh, I saw the sign.  Opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong.  Sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign.  I saw the sign. 
[04:29:00]  And it opens out my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Sign.  Sign.  I love it.  Someone do that for us.  Thank you.  Oh, God.  Fuck.  Footer wants to stick up for Fred Durst.  We ran out of show, though.  Come on.  Footer's a regular, though.  What?  Footer.  Yo, Foots.  Footer, what up, buddy?  What up, boys?  Yeah, I was getting communicated that you guys were bashing Durst.  I think it's just like a cool thing to do to bash him. 
[04:29:30]  That's the problem.  Because, I mean, think about where we really did it go wrong.  Yeah.  I just heard that Cookie for the Nookie song.  It's fucking bashable.  But it was a huge hit.  I know.  It was the biggest hit.  A lot of people hear music to make hits, then he fucking accomplished it.  Absolutely.  I don't have anything bad to say about him, Footer.  We did some cool stuff with him back in the day.  All I'm saying is he was cool, and then all of a sudden he just wasn't cool to the people anymore.  And we're trying to figure out why.  I'm not even talking about personally.  Personally, I don't give a shit. 
[04:30:00]  But, like, he just isn't.  No, he was immediately not cool.  It was such a fast, you're not cool anymore.  It was maybe the fastest ever.  Oh, yeah.  From being so cool.  Right.  Legitimately, in industry, as far as the behind the scenes rolling around Hollywood and Jimmy,  you're a fucking Hollywood Jim.  You know, I mean, Durst is a fucking player.  Oh, Hollywood Jim.  He's a what?  Yeah.  Durst is a player in Hollywood.  He really is.  I mean, he's not fucking, you know, be innocent.  No, I am.  No one talks about him anymore.  No, he doesn't.  I mean, I'm not cool.  No one is talking about him. 
[04:30:30]  He was more famous than I am, but no one's talking about him.  He was on Arsenio with Billy Ray Cyrus.  Yeah.  Who's...  What are they doing together?  They sang.  We played the clip on the show.  I don't remember.  It was really bad.  I really don't remember.  Do you want to see it real quick?  No, we gotta go home.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Go home, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Butter.  Fucking...  Thanks.  Guys in love.  Guys in fucking love with Fred Durst over there.  I know.  What the hell happened?  What are they going to...  What are they going to get a hotel room at the Borgata together?  Right?  Oh, why would they want to do that, Jim?  Because it's Valentine's Day tomorrow. 
[04:31:00]  Yeah.  And because they can't get tickets on an early show Saturday, they may want to come to that  late show.  Right.  And then make love after.  Or if they're in Pittsburgh, February the 28th, I'm at the Carnegie Muzzic Hall.  So, Ontario, California has been added March 6th through 8th.  Virginia Beach, Virginia is now March 20th through 22.  Tampa, Florida is now April 11th and 12th.  I'm gearing up to shoot another special.  Nice.  So, that's what I'm doing for these next, I guess, month and a half or so.  Ah. 
[04:31:30]  Lately, I feel like crashing.  I can't believe what's happening.  These are my one-and-starers with all this movie crash.  He hasn't aged, that's for sure.  I really don't remember us playing this.  Maybe I wasn't here.  I didn't get positive reviews on the show.  No, no.  No.  Was it considered not a particularly good...  He looks good, though.  He looks exactly the same.  Which isn't necessarily an awesome thing.  Oh.  Our podcast.  Our latest one's another really good episode.  The Opie and Anthony podcast.  Go to iTunes so we can get some bragging rights with the other podcasters. 
[04:32:00]  Basically, this week, it's Ricky Gervais and Joe Rogan together.  Meeting for the first time ever.  Meeting for the first time and doing a radio show together for the first time.  And it was great.  I mean, great radio.  So, please go get that and spread the word.  I saw the science girl doesn't want any part of the show anymore.  No part.  None.  None.  Zero.  Who wouldn't want to relive the glory of only one of the swines?  I don't know.  Her and Creepy Pie Jones are off together somewhere happy. 
[04:32:30]  Dude, I want to hear her sing that again more than anything.  Mm-hmm.  Like, I want a fucking, you know, like a reunion concert.  Yeah.  I bet it wouldn't sound good, though.  She'd be like, ah, I saw that it would be all different.  Right.  She nailed it that time.  She killed it.  I remember going through emails for that karaoke contest and just, like, email after email.  It's like, this is, ugh, ugh.  And then that email came from me.  I was like, holy shit.  Gold, right?  She's the greatest.  People are complaining there might not be a clean copy out there. 
[04:33:00]  So, can we just play it so they can grab it off the radio?  Yeah, you want to play it out?  Yeah, so they can sync it up with the video.  Swore the swines.  All right, we'll see you guys tomorrow.  We're going to play that thing one more time for the people that might want to sync it up for us.  Thank you.  I saw it.  What'd you see?  I saw it. 
[04:33:30]  I got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm a new person.  I love you.  I'm so glad you're not the one for me. 
[04:34:00]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Is enough, enough?  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  I love you. 
[04:34:30]  Do you belong?  Ooh, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you, do you?  I, I got a new game.  There's any fears of wanting who you are.  I'm a new person.  Love you.  We, we, enjoy.  I'm a little diamond where I see a lot of stars.  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  Is enough, enough? 
[04:35:00]  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  Life is demanding.  Without understanding.  I saw the sign.  And it opened up my eyes.  I saw the sign.  No one's going to drag you up to get into the lights where you belong.  But where do you belong?  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[04:35:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[04:39:30]  Behind the stories.  The backstage drama.  Everything that made today unforgettable.  Call 866-WOW-1-WOW now.  And look back on another legendary day of broadcasting.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Post Show.  Post Show.  With Sam Roberts.  Oh, great one today.  Great one today.  It's the Post Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number.  Phone lines are wide open. 
[04:40:00]  866-969-1969.  We got into it all today.  Talking about the luge.  And how it's only at the Olympics that, like, sledding becomes a professional event.  I love today because, once again, O.P. was giving no respect to Olympic athletes.  We talked about it a little bit on the pre-show.  About how yesterday, he kept calling the female Olympians broads.  He refused to refer to them as anything except broads. 
[04:40:30]  Today, he's just, he's downgrading every Olympic event.  He's talking shit about the athletes.  I mean, O.P. is Mr. No Respect when it comes to the Olympics.  And I couldn't have more respect for the fact that he's doing that.  Of course, we talked about the Derek Jeter thing.  And the return.  This was big for me.  The return of Bad Guest Day.  It doesn't get any better for me than when O.P. and Anthony have a Bad Guest Day.  That's just me.  Call up 866-WOW-1-WOW. 
[04:41:00]  Call 866-969-1969.  In the meantime, I have a question for you.  Do you hate Valentine's Day?  Do you hate gifts that only last a week?  More importantly, do you hate all the snow this winter?  Well, today's your last chance.  You better go home with a fantastic, thoughtful gift for your sweetheart.  Right?  Every year, you're told to go to Steven Singer Jewelers at the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philly and get one of those famous 24-carat premium gold-dip roses. 
[04:41:30]  Aren't you?  Yes.  Steven Singer has the only rose that's guaranteed to last a lifetime.  Picture a real long-stem rose.  It's the American beauty rose.  Lavishly preserved and deeply dipped in 24-carat pure gold.  These roses, they start at only $59.  There's free parking right across the street.  Go to IHateStevenSinger.com and check out the number one Valentine's Day gift in the country.  Then, head to the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philly and get yours today. 
[04:42:00]  Today.  He's open today.  These long-stem beauties are available right now.  If you're in the Philly area, you can still make it in time for Valentine's Day.  Weather is no excuse.  It all starts at only $59.  So don't hate Valentine's Day.  Head to the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philly.  The parking is free and you go home a hero.  Steven Singer's showroom is indeed open today.  So it's something that we should all get done. 
[04:42:30]  Speaking of getting stuff done, what do you say, Sal?  What do you say we get Line of the Day done?  Here comes Line of the Day!  Line of the Day!  A lot of wines in a bottle were in a plastic bag or a plastic jug.  At one point, before it got stuck into a glass bottle, you can see that part of its life.  But if it's a twist-off, you don't have any class. 
[04:43:00]  I'd rather drink out of a plastic bag hanging on someone's hip.  Sure.  That's insane.  It's funny.  That's how you drink.  That's how I have still.  That was Richard Betts, not the one who got the line, the one who was on the phone, taking part in what we call Bad Guest Day.  Probably the highlight of today's show, at least for me, because it's been years, I feel like, since we did a real Bad Guest Day.  Joe in Albany.  Hey, Sammy Sweetheart Robert! 
[04:43:30]  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I want that book that Opie peed on.  Okay, look, I don't think we can give away...  We don't have any books to give away today.  I'll leave it at that.  Oh, I can't get something signed by Roland and E-Rock?  I don't know if it's that book.  Let's play the clip of what happened with that book today, Sal.  What is his...  What's the name of the book?  Oh, no.  Let me see here the name of the book.  It's, uh, The Essential Scratch and Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert. 
[04:44:00]  Do you think it's going to work for you?  It's working for him.  You almost done reading it over there?  Absorbent pages?  Yeah, it's...  Oh, God, it stinks.  Not the book, sir.  There's, um... 
[04:44:30]  There's an aroma wafting up here that is not in your scratch and sniff book.  Yeah.  There we go.  Yeah, that was, uh, some of the disgust that happened today on the Opie and Anthony show.  He called in this guy, Richard Betts, to talk about his scratch and sniff wine book for Valentine's Day.  And, unfortunately, didn't realize...  Like, you'd think that when you come out with a book like that, you'd think to yourself,  why would the Opie and Anthony want to talk to me?  They can only have malintentions. 
[04:45:00]  Apparently, you get blinded sometimes.  Anthony in Astoria.  Sam, good morning.  Good morning, Anthony.  Man, I'm going to tell you, I'm going to be sick all day after hearing that Ace of Bass, uh, crap.  Oh, my God.  Well, we did...  Well, what did you like least?  The Ace of Bass version or our version from Pamela the Karaoke Girl?  Probably the original Ace of Bass version.  It's really horrible, isn't it?  Oh, it's terrible, man.  It ruined my day.  I mean, the show was terrible, but that really... 
[04:45:30]  Yeah, and now you're locked up.  You can't go anywhere, and all you can do is play Ace of Bass in your head over and over again.  And I'm at work now, you know?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I'm sorry to hear that you started your day like that, Anthony.  That's all right.  Sammy, I got a question for you.  Yeah.  What time is it, man?  Now, I don't do time checks on this show.  Call it pre-show.  And it is 45 after the hour.  Now, the thing, though, about the Ace of Bass thing is the same thing we were talking about  the Limp Bizkit thing earlier.  That at one point or another, Ace of Bass was cool. 
[04:46:00]  Like, that song was like, yeah, this is a great song.  But then something happens where these things get so big that they're just not cool anymore.  At all.  Let's go to Peter on Long Island.  What's up, Peter?  Hey, prime time.  Good to see you again.  Listen, that was a pretty good halftime show today.  Which, are you talking about the one Opie and Anthony did?  Yeah, I tuned in for the Sam Roberts show and a bunch of crap.  And then the Sam Roberts show.  I thought it was all right today.  Not bad. 
[04:46:30]  Yeah, I mean, this is the big game.  Opie and Anthony are like Bruno Mars.  Well, yeah, Bruno was a little better than Opie.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Ouch.  Ouch.  I don't know.  I think Opie was MVP in today.  Joey in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, I missed it.  I called just as the guy was hanging up.  But I was going to tell him, have 10 taste books priced out at $1 and sold in the 99 cent store.  Well, there were a lot of questions that a lot of fans chimed in with today. 
[04:47:00]  I believe we have another clip that one of the fans chimed in with.  Let's hear it.  So let's just start from the top.  All right, we'll go.  I see it's Jason, though.  Jason in Akron.  Jason, what's going on?  You're on with Richard Betts, who has a fantastic wine book.  Hi, Richard.  I was wondering if you double as the leprechaun for the Denver Broncos.  No, you know, I don't.  It sounds like a fun thing to do, though.  Oh.  Oh, it's very fun.  Why would you say that, Jason? 
[04:47:30]  He sounds gay.  What?  Whoa.  That is really funny.  How brutal and blunt can a caller possibly be?  That was Travis's clip of the day?  That was.  Oh, I do not blame him.  I'm surprised I didn't make line of the day to tell you the truth.  Sal, did you especially take pride in the fact that he brought up the Denver Broncos leprechaun?  Yeah, that's what I, when I saw the call screen of putting that up, I was like, oh, shit, I hope Opie takes that one.  Yeah, because I feel like that would mean, because we met the Denver Broncos leprechaun when Sal went out on the street for Super Bowl week and tried to get himself punched in the face. 
[04:48:00]  And is it nice to hear that it's made that type of impact on people?  Yeah, absolutely.  And he had that big old herpes on his lower lip.  He did have a herpes sore.  If you go to O&A Show on Twitter and you scroll through the pictures, you can see a couple weeks ago, Friday before Super Bowl, we posted a picture of that guy.  But this is not Super Bowl weekend, no.  This is Valentine's Day weekend.  As a matter of fact, Valentine's Day is tomorrow. 
[04:48:30]  And for about the price of a dozen roses, you can do something that she'll love even more.  This year, you can score major points.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR or go to vermontteddybear.com now and send a handmade Vermont teddy bear.  Picture this.  You bear gram her at the office.  When it arrives, she'll be so surprised.  And her co-workers will think you're the greatest guy on the planet. 
[04:49:00]  Exercise your romantic freedom with the new right to hugs bear.  Make Valentine's Day sizzle with the I love you more than bacon bear.  Crazy for her?  Send the nuts for you bear.  Or express your undying love with the zombie love bear.  For the ultimate hug, send a big hunk of love bear.  He's about four feet tall and guaranteed to get a huge reaction.  It's a four-foot-tall stuffed animal.  What do you expect?  Check him out at vermontteddybear.com. 
[04:49:30]  Overnight and Valentine's Day delivery still, still get this guaranteed.  Holy Toledo.  Send the creative alternative to flowers this year.  Call 1-800-829-BEAR or go to vermontteddybear.com.  Just something you can do as we wrap up the Opie and Anthony show here on the post show.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number to call.  Now, we were talking a moment ago about what Sal took pride in.  The fact that somebody remembered his interaction with the Leprechaun, with the Denver Broncos Leprechaun. 
[04:50:00]  Which, by the way, the Broncos, I'm sure, do not endorse him in any way, shape, or form.  He's just some idiot who dresses up as an orange Leprechaun and buys tickets to the games.  But...  Especially not what he's doing with his mouth.  Yeah, you're talking about his herpes sore again?  Yeah, exactly.  It really was distracting when you were interviewing him.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  It was the only thing I was staring at.  Were you feeling like you couldn't get too close to him when you were talking to him because it might jump off his face? 
[04:50:30]  Yeah, I also didn't want to make sure I touched the mic to his face on accident because that would have just ruined the mic forever.  Yeah, and then all of a sudden you touch it to your own mic, your own face by mistake, and you've got herpes, don't you?  Yeah, and I have a bigger problem than tonsillitis.  It's worse than bed bugs.  And, yeah, I mean, if you didn't hear it this morning, they got into Sal's tonsillitis.  Sal is one of the very few adults that are still getting his tonsils taken out.  Um, but, what I took pride in today was the fact that I think I turned Anthony around on 2 Chainz. 
[04:51:00]  Now, we were playing 2 Chainz because, Anthony, we were playing the new Nicki Minaj song.  We got into a conversation about the N-word again, and the fact that Nicki Minaj uses that N-word in her new song basically every other word.  By the way, the guys had glowing reviews for Nicki Minaj's new song.  However, Ant came out of the gate and said he didn't like 2 Chainz.  So I had to play him a video that was just, it's just the most absurd, ignorant, stereotypical rap music video that you could possibly think of. 
[04:51:30]  And I'm going, like, the only reason Ant doesn't like this is because he hasn't given it a chance.  He loves that stuff.  So finally he gave it a chance, and I think my mission was accomplished.  866-WOW1-WOW.  Going back to the phones here on the post-show, and we go to Ron in Philly.  What's up, Ron?  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How you doing?  Good, man.  Hey, uh, I've been thinking about this for a little while, but, uh, like, the, the, the fellas, like, their mood swings, 
[04:52:00]  mommy of, like, something like, like, dictators or, like, tyrants, you know?  Like, they, it's really, uh, uh, you know, like, it seems like sometimes they're real benevolent to you,  like, they're real good to, like, you know, the staff and crew, but sometimes they'll just destroy,  and, like, I, obviously I know the show, I mean, I get it, but, you know.  Well, the staff, the staff kind of operates around here like abused, crate-trained puppies,  in the sense that, like, we've been all beaten to the ground so much that anything that resembles a compliment, 
[04:52:30]  we become, uh, completely grateful for.  We all have Stockholm Syndrome behind the scenes at the L.P. and Anthony show.  Right, right.  So basically, like, you know, it's kind of one of those things, imagine being, like, working for Saddam Hussein or, like, D.D. I mean,  you know, you just, you don't know if they're in a good mood one day, you know,  and maybe they'll give you something or whatever.  But the difference, the difference is, the difference is, I feel like Opie and Anthony,  these, you just named horrible dictators.  I feel as though Opie and Anthony are benevolent dictators. 
[04:53:00]  Sure, right.  There's a big difference there.  Thank you, Ron, but, yeah, good call.  Would you say that's right, Sal?  Yeah, the Stockholm Syndrome thing, I, I do agree with.  Because you, you're just constantly looking for approval from those guys,  because that's also the job.  I mean, we kind of have to read their minds and hope that they like what we give them.  Yeah, they're our boss at the end of the day.  And at the beginning of the day, too, as soon as we get here, they're still the boss.  Terrible expression.  Let me tell you something about what you can do for your boss.  Better yet, I'm going to tell you what you can do for your lover. 
[04:53:30]  Guys, Valentine's Day is tomorrow.  You didn't know that?  Yes, it's tomorrow.  And here's an amazing Valentine's Day secret.

[04:55:00]  The segment that made me most uncomfortable today on the show was what we did in the beginning.  And if you're on the West Coast and you missed any of this, we're starting it up again right  after I'm done here.  Or we're done here.  This is our show.  But watching the videos that we watched early this morning first thing, it's the worst way  to start a morning.  I guess there were a whole bunch of GoPro videos that kind of got out overnight.  And it's all videos of like, there was one video of two kids climbing the second tallest 
[04:55:30]  tower in the world.  And I think it was in Shanghai.  The second tallest building in the world and just climbing to the top of it.  It makes you feel like you're going to fall.  Then we watched the video of the guy jumping from space.  A new video of him came out.  We watched some guy base jump off a ski lift.  It's the worst way to start your morning because I'm still stressed out over it.  I don't know if that does that to you.  But I guess it's just a crippling fear of heights or whatever it is.  Well, tomorrow, the big Valentine's Day show here on the Opie and Anthony channel starting 
[04:56:00]  at 6.30 a.m. Eastern with, of course, Sam Roberts at 6 a.m.  I don't want to give away too much of what we've got planned tomorrow, but a big game  on the way for tomorrow's show.  Some of your favorites will be back in.  Some of the Super Show guests will be back in.  And we've got a game to play tomorrow.  I don't want to say what game it is, but let's just say somebody may win a date.  Huh?  Huh?  Stay tuned for that. 
[04:56:30]  And stay tuned for today's show.  It's coming up next.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye, everybody.  Thanks for listening to Opie and Anthony and the Opie and Anthony Post Show.
