<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about an upcoming album listening party and security measures at record companies.  Comedian Paul Mercurio, a guest in the studio, called in to thank the hosts for promotion and complained about a terrible waitress at Caroline's Comedy Club.  A caller, Shelly, then sparked a sexually explicit conversation about a "balloon nut" law in Cincinnati. This segued into a discussion of conspiracy theories, including UFOs, government weather manipulation, and the moon landing, with participation from callers, including "weather conspiracy guy" Jim Laranaca, who discussed his book on government weather control.  A prank call segment using a "Dice" soundboard targeting Chinese restaurants also occurred.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the "WOW" contest, specifically the fallout from the elimination of ten contestants.  Jennifer, a contestant, angrily called in, followed by her boyfriend, Bob, who engaged in a heated, vulgar exchange with the hosts about their respective genitalia.  The hosts and callers continued to deliver overwhelmingly negative and often vulgar critiques of various contestants' photos, particularly Jennifer's, focusing heavily on their physical attributes. Photographer Rick also called, expressing his frustration with contestant "Swiss Miss" (number 90).  The hosts briefly mentioned an upcoming segment featuring a "how to make a radio demo" with Steve from foundrymusic.com.

The show then shifted to a satirical segment mocking Michael Jackson's public statements about embracing his blackness, using offensive racial slurs and stereotypes.  They also speculated on the reasons behind his declining popularity and discussed his record sales, accusations of child abuse, and compared his music to that of Elvis and Eminem.  The hosts expressed anger and disbelief at the lack of public concern over the abuse allegations.  This segment included sound clips from Michael Musto of The Village Voice and numerous listener calls offering humorous and often offensive "What did we learn today?" contributions, including racially charged language and homophobic slurs.

Other notable segments included: a phone interview with Steve Irwin promoting "The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course," which included graphic details about crocodile mating habits and Irwin's injuries;  promotion of the return of Tippi Tom, a homeless, sexually active man, with a call-in number provided; a comedic segment using audio from Anthony's wedding; and a listener call reporting seeing a "WOW" sign painted on a construction site. The hosts frequently referenced the "WOW" contest throughout the broadcast, reviewing entries, arbitrarily eliminating contestants, and engaging in explicit commentary regarding their physical attributes and perceived sexual activity.  The broadcast concluded with further listener calls and mentions of future show content, including the Tippi Tom segment and their appearance at OzFest.  Throughout the entire broadcast, Gary and Ben, regular sidekicks to Opie and Anthony, were present in the studio.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. We can freeze his head.  Let's do it!  And welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We can freeze his head.  What a day for a whip-em-out Wednesday.  Ah, yes.  How insane is WOW getting? We told all the new cities.  Yeah.  Are you seeing WOW pretty much everywhere now?  Everywhere.  Everywhere. A lot of people slapping the WOW on in all types of fashion. 
[00:00:30]  The stickers that they could get from the stations or just writing it on a piece of paper on the dirt in the back of the truck.  And people are getting WOWed. It's happening.  We told you. It'll continue to grow and grow and grow.  Speaking of WOW, I was just looking at some of the latest contestants.  In the WOW contest?  Yeah, I got a couple of good ones in there.  Philly came to the table overnight, huh?  Certainly did.  Philly, representing. Gary, what's going on?  Dude, what's going on, man? 
[00:01:00]  Hey, stop the contest now. 93 wins.  93 is really, really hot.  Stacy, hot.  That second one and that last pick. Oh, man.  Let me look at the last picture as an ass shot.  And WOW.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  And the second one where she's got her finger in her mouth.  Exactly.  And, yeah.  It's definitely made the F-dun go by a little bit of clicking those up.  Yeah, Philly stole that pose from Rick, I do believe.  Oh, are they stealing Rick's poses? 
[00:01:30]  Yes, they are.  They didn't take the Britney Spears, did they?  The other cameramen around the country stealing Rick's poses.  Yeah.  I wonder if they're naming their poses in their city.  Fine.  And that's called the Philly cheesesteak right there.  Whatever you want to call it, it works, man.  All right, man.  Yeah, Stacy's really hot.  Contestant number three.  Later.  Thank you.  A lot of new girls went up overnight, Anthony.  Amber, don't look too bad.  There's a bunch of them.  Check them out for yourself.  Opie and Anthony.com.  We don't want to spend too much time in the WOW contest today, 
[00:02:00]  but there's a lot of controversy going on.  We want to stop it at 100.  At 100 girls.  A couple things going on.  In the rules, it says you can qualify until next Friday.  Oh, it does?  A week from Friday.  Those pesky rules.  Ben got a call from Las Vegas.  Yeah.  By the way, we're doing really well in the ratings in Las Vegas, we heard today.  Thank you, Vegas, on a stupid AM station.  It's great.  Our fans aren't even supposed to know where the AM dial is.  Yeah.  But they found us on AM. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you.  They're loving the show in Vegas.  I guess Las Vegas has, you ready for this?  Yeah.  30.  30 girls.  30 girls.  Coming down to the station tomorrow to enter the WOW contest.  Nice.  And they're panicking because they heard us say yesterday that we want to stop it at 100 girls.  Well, we can get over 100.  Yes.  We just wanted at least 100 girls.  Yes.  So that's fine. 
[00:03:00]  And I'm a little scared about stopping the qualifying because the quality has gone way up in the last two or three days.  It really has.  I mean, way up.  Yeah, there's the occasional mess in there, sure.  We should throw some girls out.  Make room for the hotter chicks that are coming in.  You want to throw some out?  Like five girls will just throw out of the contest.  Why don't we do that without any voting or anything?  We are taking it upon ourselves to throw you out. 
[00:03:30]  Why don't we make room for some of the hot girls that are ready to enter the contest tomorrow and maybe today and maybe Friday?  It's picking up steam now, this contest.  And at the beginning, yee, ooh.  All right.  Turn the screen around, Anthony.  Why don't we quickly throw 10 girls out of the contest?  10 girls getting thrown out right now.  Yes.  Turn the screen around.  Let's go.  You can play along at home.  Go to opianthony.com.  All right.  Now, we've got to go 1 through 20.  Yes.  So the messes that are, you know, way down. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  In the qualifying list there, they're safe, I do believe.  It's the mess.  All right.  We already got one.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Look at it.  Ben's laughing his ass off, and he's raising his hand.  Contestant one from Sacramento is safe.  Contestant number two is safe.  Contestant number three, safe.  Contestant number four, safe.  Yeah.  Contestant five, who we met personally when we were up in Boston, safe.  Very safe.  And now we get to six.  Now we get to six.  Lilith, out with the Marilyn Manson body.

Make room.  Make room for the hot chicks.  Let's go to contestant number seven from WCKG in Chicago.  Oh.  All right.  Well, we're going to not even get through the first 20 without throwing 10 out.  All right.  It's okay.  Let's go to...

Shut up, Mr.  I can't even say what you were doing in the back office while you were watching a fine video  that one of our listeners sent in.  Okay.  So, Gemini's out.  No, you've got to go back up to 10.  10, safe, obviously.  Sheldon, safe.  11, safe.  Safe.  12.

It is a wow contest.  It is.  You've got to remember, it is a wow contest.  She's safe. 
[00:06:30]  Safe.  Safe.  Safe.  A lot of people yelling on the phone lines, don't take the ugly chicks out of the contest.  They clean the pallet between the hot chicks.  Believe me, there'll be plenty of pigs left even after we get rid of it.  We're just getting rid of the ones that are ruining this contest.  Yeah, because we've got to get more hot chicks in there.  Right.  But it's going to mess everyone's numbering system.  No, we could just leave 18.  Someone today goes, what number is Parker?  I go, oh, that's contestant number 27.  Yeah.  I know all the numbers of the hot chicks.  We don't have to push the numbers in.  Just put the red slash through it and removed from contest. 
[00:07:00]  All right, cool.  So what do we got?  Six, seven, and nine are out.  Keep going.  All right.  Safe.  Safe.  You've got to keep contestant number 20 with the martini, man.  Yeah, and she's got some jokes.  Yeah, she's all right.  All right, we go to the second page, 21 through 40.  Okay, let's go right to contestant number 22.  Safe.  21 is safe.  22?  It's a wild contest, and they're natural.  We don't have a lot of natural.  They're natural.  Okay.  They're big.  All right, how about the chick that was in real world London?

Here we go.  All right.  You know who this chick looks like?  We're looking now at contestant number 30.  Oh, man.  Where the belly button's eating her tattoo.  Oh, and the squared off boobies.  This girl's cans are square if it is a girl.  I'm thinking, because there's a headless shot. 
[00:08:30]  You know that guy that shows up to all of our appearances that looks like Ace Reely?  Yes.  I'm thinking that's the guy.  All right.  She is out.  Out.  Get her out.  Raven.  We've got to make room for the hot chick.  Hot chick's coming in.  Coming in.  Get out, 30.  Natalie, definitely safe.  Safe.  32.  I think.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She's right on the fence.  Let's go to this one. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, boy.  They're kind of puffy and.  All right.  She's safe.  Are you lucky?  Yeah, we'll let the audience decide on that one when the time comes.  She's kind of safe.  Lurking behind me.  Let's go down to Jennifer.  Oh, where?  Over here?  What about Robin?  Uh, no.  I mean, Candy.  Candy.  Yeah, she's in.  Okay.  Jennifer.  Jennifer.  She's.

She's got the graveyard teeth.  I forgot.  Tombstone teeth.  So, what do you think?  Ow!  Ow!  Jennifer's out.  Contestant number 35, out.  That's four.  We need to get six more really fast.  And then we can start our stupid show.  Kira in.  Kira with glasses, definitely in.  Annie in.  In.  In.  Sunshine in.  Oh, boy. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, boy.  Okay, let's go.  All right.  We've got to pop this up.  Ah.  Oh, boy.  Leonardo DiCaprio.  Leonardo DiCaprio.  Look at it.  That's rough.  That is rough.  You need another shot?  That's a rough ride right there.  Let's look at this shot right here.  Maybe this will decide.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Even trying to prop him up.  Look at it.  One's looking one way.  One's looking the other.  Ah.  And why don't you decide on Leonardo DiCaprio? 
[00:10:30]  Ouch!  Ouch!  What number is that?  He's number 39.  39.  All right.  We're trying to make room for the hot chicks that are coming soon.  Hot chicks.  Courtesy of Vegas tomorrow.  All right.  Let's go to the next set of pictures.  All right.  Here we go.  Safe.  Safe.  That chick from contestant number 42.  Beautiful.  Wow.  A bunch of hot chicks in a row.  Okay.

We might as well do it live on the air.  All right.  All right.  Safe.  Safe.  I mean, we might have to go through these again tomorrow and get rid of some more.  But for now, we're trying to get right to the meat of the problem.  So safe.  So safe.  Nice hot streak here.  Yeah, look at this. 
[00:11:30]  We're rocking.  How about moose noses?  Where's the...  Which one?  57.  Got to stay.  Oh.  Moose noses are reshoot much better.  Reshoot much better, yeah.  Moose noses stays.  Rick learned.  And I heard she was at a bar and she was talking to friends.  And she's like, they said my nose looks like a moose.  No.  Oh, your boobs, you idiot.  All right.  Everyone on this page stays.  Safe.  Wow.  That was a good page.  See?  How many we got left?  Three spots.  Three spots.  That's what I'm talking.  The quality picked up. 
[00:12:00]  Way picked up.  The end of this contest.  Look.  In.  In.  In.  In.  In.  82.  84.  In.  85.  In.  86.  In.  In.  In.  In.  In.  In.  All right.  Go to 92 there.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.

You missed a page of messages.  All right.  I apologize.  You went to a really hot page.  You got to go 61 through 80. 
[00:12:30]  Okay.  All right.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Good, good.  There we go.  What about the girl with the skin cancer?  She's all right?  Yeah.  Someone's saying that might be a flyer in a boob.  I'm thinking melanoma myself.  It's in all the pictures.  All right.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Why don't we go to Larry Bird naked?  Contestant number 67 from Sacramento.  67, Larry Bird.  Oh, boy.  Oh, God.  Oh, look at the little.  Okay.  What do you think, Ant?  Get out!  Get out!

I think for the, well, they're nice boobs.  They are really big, meaty cans.  Huge belly, and you cut her head off, it makes a cute little, like, cartoon character.  Yeah, see?  Okay.  There is the grimace.  Hey, you know what?  We says a wow contest, though.  Yeah.  See?  She's in.  She's got to stay.

I guess she stays for now.  She's got to stay.  Yeah, I think for now.  For now.  All right.  Why don't we go to 74?  74.  Well, what about 72?  72.  There's some problems with 72, it looks like.  Let's go to 72.  72.  From Sacramento. 
[00:14:00]  Okay.  Oh, well, it's a wow contest.  Yeah.  Well, we'll leave it in.  We'll leave it in.  Do you think wow when you see that?  No.  It's not a ugh contest.  Yeah.  What do you think, Ant?  Well, we're clearing house.  You're out!  She's out?  Out.  Contestant 72 out.  All right.  As we go down, what, what, were you on at 74?  Yeah, the Portland contingency.  Okay.  I don't know.  She looks like a happy girl.  Is that the only picture of her? 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, I don't see any other.  Oh, God.  Dude.  Oh, my God.  You're out!  I'm sorry, Portland.  Wow.  I mean, she could reach as high as she wants.  I mean, she's not going to bring those babies back to Earth.  I just wanted a look.  That's 10?  All right.  Well, just go through the rest of this page and make sure we didn't miss an obvious.  All right.  All right.  And go through 81 through, like, 95.  Here we go.  Hot.  Really fast.  Hot.  That whole page is pretty hot, huh?  What a great lap. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Well, let's just go there.  Let's see.  Oh, my God.  Well, it's a wow contest, like you said.  She's safe.  All right.  She's safe for now.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is that it?  That's it for the page.  Okay.  That's it.  All right.  Ben, walk the list down the hall.  We have eliminated 10 girls from the wow contest.  That easy to make room for the hotties from Vegas.  Their pictures will be turned into black and white with a big red X across their picture. 
[00:15:30]  What's the matter, Jimmy?  It's tough, you know?  It's a tough contest.  You've got to make some tough decisions when you do a fine radio show like this.  Yes.  I'm not saying that you're not a fine radio show.  I just, I don't know.  All right.  That means we have, what, 94 girls.  We're down to 84.  Yeah.  16 more girls can enter the contest.  Bravo.  You've got to get rid of a...  We have been getting crap about all 10 of those girls we just eliminated from this contest.  Every day we read the emails, the feedbacks, the phone calls going, dude, what the hell 
[00:16:00]  is with number, you know?  And finally, we took it out.  Seth, what's going on?  Hey, did you guys get rid of Clint Howard?  No, we actually didn't get rid of Clint Howard.  Which one was Clint Howard?  Clint Howard is, let me look.  I think, what number is Clint?  Did you look?  I can't look at it from here.  You're supposed to know the numbers by heart at this point.  I'm at work.  They're fighting me for that.  Was it early on in the contest or late?  I think she's in the 30s, I think.  30s?  Which one was Clint Howard in? 
[00:16:30]  I'll show you, because I know exactly who he's talking about.  I think Opie's trying to save Clint Howard to jump on more sports.  Here's Clint Howard.  Oh, okay.  That's Clint Howard.  But that's a nice wow.  See?  Yeah, she's got R.I. cans.  What contestant so they can play along at all?  That's contestant number 14.  Better known as Clint Howard, according to Seth.  Clint Howard, but, you know, she's got some jugs on her.  All right, let's go to Mike.  A lot of people are having problems with what we just did. 
[00:17:00]  Yes, Mike?  Hey, you guys didn't throw out the fat girl that looked like a farmhand, did you?  No.  She is right for the contest.  She's got the stringy hair.  She's foul, man.  Yeah.  How could people be upset?  We threw out number six.  Well, like, Mike wanted to say, some of these girls are just funny to look at.  Oh, their pictures will still be up.  Yeah, you'll just have to try to look at them through a big red cross across their faces,  and it'll be a black and white picture. 
[00:17:30]  Yes, Jim Norton?  I got to voice dissent.  I don't think you should, just because it's easy for strippers to get their pictures taken naked.  It's a lot harder for these chicks to do it.  And the fact that they agreed to do it, and they were troopers, even though they're not as hot,  they should be voted out fair and square like they were promised.  No, you know what this is?  Oh, this is what we do in the back office.  Yeah, this is how we do it.  This is how we do it.  I think we're going to put it to a vote to knock it down to the top 20.  But there's plenty of regular girls that are left. 
[00:18:00]  We just took out the obvious.  The obvious.  The ones that, like I said, we've just been getting crap about since day one.  That's all.  That's right.  There was some tough decisions there?  Not really.  No, not at all.  I mean, come on.  Quite easy.  Number six, stop it.  Stop it.  Two weeks.  And everyone's been saying Gemini has a sack since the pictures went up.  Josh.  Two weeks.  Yeah.  What's wrong, Josh?  I have to agree with Jimmy on this one. 
[00:18:30]  You guys, you know, you bitch and moan about people not coming in to take the thing, and  then you make room for prettier people.  That's like Jimmy going to an Aussie concert.  There's only 100 seats.  He's one of the first people through the door.  And what do they do?  Oh, somebody who loves the Osborne show wants to come in, and they look a little prettier  than Jimmy Norton, so let's kick Jimmy Norton out, a hardcore fan, and put in some new pretty  people in the audience.  Let me tell you something, Josh.  Life's not easy, and Ann and I had to fake it for the last week or so to get girls to come  in here.  Uh-huh.  We are back to being brutally honest. 
[00:19:00]  I totally understand, but I do.  We have plenty of girls for the contest now.  Hot girls.  Hot girls.  Oh, boy.  I hope they take care of that.  You think they took care of that?  I hope so.  They should have taken care of that, right?  Yeah.  I hope so.  All right.  Let's go to Luke.  Hey, Luke.  What's up?  Yeah.  What's up, Robert?  Hey.  Yo, guys.  Listen.  The best of words that you guys kicked out, put a reject sign on them.  Reject? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Like a big red line, write a reject.  Now, listen to this.  Listen to this.  The best reject, the worst reject, I mean, wins a makeover.  No.  No.  Come on.  No.  That's like morning zoo stuff, bro.  That's right.  All right, guys.  You've done a good job.  How about we just put across their pictures?  Not good enough.  Oh.  And you know something?  We're not clearing out for better chicks.  We're just making room.  We're speculating that the girls that take those 10 girls' spots are going to be hotter 
[00:20:00]  than those girls.  We don't know.  Just because they're, like, probably going to be Vegas showgirls doesn't mean they're  going to be hot.  Well, Vegas is, I guess, stepping up big time tomorrow.  They're going to give us 30 girls for the contest.  Yeah.  That's a minute.  And again, where has Vegas been all this time?  And then you've got girls from, like, Jersey and Philly who have been here getting booted.  Charlie, what's up?  Yeah, it's me. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Hey, has anybody noticed that another 84, that's the chick with the, uh, a lot of  Audi makeup on?  84.  Contestant 84.  Let me punch it up, okay?  What's your name again?  Are you, uh, in your car?  Hey, her head doesn't match the body.  This guy knows his numbers by heart.  Because I think he's calling from the car.  Uh.  Her head's a completely different shade than her body.  Like somebody, a computer, you know.  Oh, you're thinking that might be Photoshop?  No.  That's fucking screwy there. 
[00:21:00]  She's just got a lot of makeup on her face.  Yeah, I know.  But look at the color of her head and the color of her body.  And the body just doesn't match the head.  Yeah.  He's got to be holding a rifle in one hand and pro-Castro pamphlets in the other.  Good.  And it's lighting there.  There's, for some reason, uh, it's a big wazoo.  They got this floodlight that they put the girls in.  I don't know.  It looks like it faded around her neck like it faded it in somehow.  All right.  We'll investigate.  All right.  We got good guys, uh, that know what they're doing as far as that goes. 
[00:21:30]  So, all right?  All right.  Good job.  All right, bro.  Those are legit.  Huh?  Guy's out of his mind.  I'm looking at them right now and they're completely legit.  Boy, that was good.  Weed them out.  Let me go to James.  Hey, James, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  I support your decision of weeding those, uh, dogs out.  Oh, cool.  Um, hey, what's up with Tippy Tom?  When's he, when, when are you guys going to have him back on?  Tomorrow. 
[00:22:00]  Tomorrow.  I believe.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  We have a huge surprise for Tippy Tom on tomorrow's program.  Right?  Sweet.  Is it all set up, guys?  I think it's all set up.  Great.  Tomorrow is going to be great with Tippy Tom.  All right?  Fabulous.  Uh, yeah, we got to find him.  As long as we can find him.  Yeah, I was going to say, how do you guys track this guy down if he's homeless?  He's got a low jack.  It's weird.  The homeless guys in New York, they stay in the same areas and they're pretty easy to find.  Yeah, homeless guys don't just wander the streets all the time. 
[00:22:30]  They have their, like, territory and they got their place that they live.  They got homes.  Yeah.  The homeless have homes.  It just doesn't have a roof, but it's like, hey, this is my grate.  This is my bench.  This is my tree.  That's why you see the same bum laying on the street in the same spot when you're walking  by every day, you know?  You see him laying there or underneath his shopping cart.  Whatever.  All right?  Well, great.  All right.  Oh, tune in tomorrow then.  Tippy Tom returns tomorrow.  Tippy Tom.  We're going to take care of him tomorrow, too. 
[00:23:00]  Big time.  All right.  You guys suck.  That's all we can say right now.  Thank you, man.  Because we want it to be a surprise for Tippy Tom.  Hey, Jim, how many of those girls have you had sex with?  None.  We just knocked out a contest.  I've only met, I think, one of them.  None of them.  It's not about that.  Okay.  You met two weeks.  You met that girl.  Yeah, but it's not even about that.  It's just the other girls.  Trade any emails with her yet?  No, not at all.  No?  None of them.  Mike, what's going on?  I have no ulterior motives.  The girl there with the hair under her arms?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Instead of pulling a cross through, you should Photoshop a ukulele into her hand, and she  looked like Tiny Tim.  All right.  Wow, Tiny Tim reference.  She's out of the contest.  Nice.  And we might boot another 10 tomorrow.  Cool.  Could be.  Thank you.  All right, later.  All right, quick call from Buffalo, and we've got to take a break, because we've got the  croc hunter, Steve Irwin.  Ah.  New movie's coming out, so we'll talk to him in a few minutes here.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  Listen, I was driving home from work today, and there's a construction site on Delaware 
[00:24:00]  Avenue at Kenmore, and they're building like a mini mall thing?  Yeah.  It's all concrete right now, but the construction workers painted a huge wow sign up on it,  and they did a really excellent job.  I've got to send you a picture.  Oh, please do.  We'll put it right up on foundrymusic.com.  You got it, guys.  Jimmy, you rule.  Hey, we'll see you Saturday, right, Chris?  Oh, I can't wait.  T&A with O&A.  All right, cool.  Peace.  Doing a big thing Saturday in Buffalo.  We certainly are.  As long as we get to Buffalo in one piece.  I'm sure it'll be fine.  Thanks for the Value Jet airline tickets, guys. 
[00:24:30]  Value Jet.  Let it not be Value Jet.  Well, it says airlines at the end.  Isn't that what you wanted?  No, stupid.  It isn't.  Two wings, a tail.  That's all you need.  Let's just put it this way.  Jim Norton once flew this airline.  We're taking a Buffalo.  Yeah.  And there was duct tape on the wing once.  Yeah.  And I complained because it was peeling, like this silver duct tape.  Because I always sit in emergency room.  You always sit in the emergency room.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Is that because you want the leg room or because you want to be responsible if you want to  have to get out?  I want to look around.  I know what I'm doing.  I trust me.  I don't trust a bunch of fat ladies on a plane.  True.  And the broad next to me gets mad because I mentioned that there was duct tape on the  wing.  And the maintenance had to change it.  I'm like, you want to take off with that?  Hanging off?  What was it taping?  They have this.  It's not actual duct tape.  It's a silver tape.  Yeah.  It's common use on airlines. 
[00:25:30]  Value jet used it a lot.  I believe having an incident every other day before they finally shut down planes that  were bought from a ruined Turkish airline is where they got those planes from.  What does it cover?  Like a hatch or something?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It may be a piece of metal if a screw is missing.  I don't know.  Wow.  It's not good.  You know, Boeing doesn't ship it out like that.  It didn't come off the assembly line with that tape on it.  Here's a roll of tape for the wing.  Wing tape.  It really annoyed me.  You know.  I specify a certain airline. 
[00:26:00]  I've only flown like once or twice this year.  I'm not going to get this big status.  It's a matter of safety.  I like a certain airline for safety reasons.  You like Continental.  Because they have new planes.  All right?  I don't care about wider flying.  I want new planes.  That's it.  All right?  I want a young fleet.  Well, we'll see you in Buffalo Saturday.  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, is that me?  Yeah.  Yeah, hey, man.  I'm on 202 North there. 
[00:26:30]  I'm driving my truck home from work.  I'm a wow on the back of my trailer.  Yeah.  And you guys are kicking broads off on the contest there.  I look down and there's a fan full of chicks wowing me, yelling to me.  Do you think your keys would make the cut?  The what?  Yeah, man.  I mean, I got wowed by a whole fan load of chicks.  Well, congratulations, Jay.  All right, man.  All right, bro.  Later.  Bye.  There you go.  See, we...  And every Wednesday, we try.  We try, and that's what you get.  We know the wow is happening. 
[00:27:00]  Now he's got the volume cranked up on his radio.  We know the wow thing works.  It just doesn't make great radio when guys call in to say, holy crap, it worked.  We know it works.  Yeah, please.  We've been doing this for about six or seven seasons now.  You get that?  Dude, I was there, and I saw the girls wowed me.  All right, great.  Thank you.  Put a wow on your car.  If you need a wow sticker from the New York area, well, send a self-addressed stamped envelope. 
[00:27:30]  That's how we deal with it here.  888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  That address should be up on opandentony.com.  Roy.  Okay?  Roy.  Steve Irwin next.  Also, we've got to really get into the Michael Jackson thing today, because the guy's out of his mind now.  Wacko Jacko.  He's on the front page of our paper here in New York.  I'm no freak.  Yes, you are.  And I think the New York Post was listening to our show yesterday.  Yeah.  Because we were joking how they have to work Wacko Jacko into everything.  And then they rhyme things with Wacko and Jacko. 
[00:28:00]  And we were doing that on the show yesterday.  Wacko Jacko likes young boys Sacco.  That was one from yesterday.  Wacko Jacko doesn't think he's Blacko.  Right.  So the Post got in on the fun, Anthony.  And the article starts off, Wacko Jacko says he's no freak-o.  Freak-o, that's horrible.  If one of our listeners called in with that yesterday, we wouldn't even put him on the air.  Hung up on him.  That's on the front page of the New York Post today.  That's stupid.  Can you picture him saying, I would kiss you, but you're so damned ugly? 
[00:28:30]  He is a real dummy.  Wacko Jacko never liked Lisa Marie Presley's Racco.  See?  That's a good one.  I thought he was going to say taco.  Or taco.  Taco, I know.  Tortillas.  Lean cuisine.  You're a literate hebe.  Not even here.  All right.  You've got to give him a chance, man.  You've got to give him a chance.  Yeah, we've got to get into the Michael Jackson thing.  He's got Reverend Al Sharpton involved now. 
[00:29:00]  And now he is embracing his blackness.  He is embracing the fact that he is an African-American.  And now he's proud of it for some reason.  Don't you have to be black to embrace your blackness?  Yeah.  He wants to embrace his blackness now and expose people as being racist.  And he says, I'm a black man.  He chose that.  Yet he cut off his nostrils.  Right.  And his lips.  And his skin is white.  And his hair is straight.  And he's got no African features whatsoever.  Yet he did as a child.  But for some reason, he's removed any African features he has. 
[00:29:30]  Yet he says he's a proud black man.  He chose a long time ago not to embrace his blackness.  Stop.  Stop.  Your album tanked.  And now he's trying to blame people.  You think maybe it's the allegations of pedophilia?  Maybe that's it?  Yeah, maybe that made people steer a little clearer your work.  Maybe you lost respect in the industry because, you know, when you touch young boys and then  pay off their families.  He was still selling records, even with all those charges.  Especially when you're hogging all the hot ones.  And I've got to go after fatties because they're all starstruck when you're in the room. 
[00:30:00]  You know something?  The consumer doesn't give a flying crap what you do personally in the music business.  It's true.  It just sucks.  As long as you put out, you know, good music, they're going to buy it.  You're going to buy it.  And if there is some controversy, it actually helps your album sales in most cases, okay?  In this case, he just put out a horrendous album.  It was the joke of the industry.  We got to hear tracks of his latest CD months before it came out.  Yeah, horrid.  You know why?  Because people were passing around on the inside here going, you've got to hear this. 
[00:30:30]  It's unbelievable how bad it is.  He's just done.  He hasn't been able to reinvent himself.  And no one wants to hear him anymore.  So his record tanks.  And now he's teamed up with the Reverend Al Sharpton, another jackass.  And they're exposing racism in the record industry.  We'll get more into it in a little bit.  But I think we've got to get Steve Irwin on the phone first.  Hey, we've got Tommy Lee calling in today, too? 
[00:31:00]  Yep.  And some guy that has this weather conspiracy thing wants to talk about.  I'll talk to him.  Hey, can we play Anthony's wedding thing?  My weather machine will destroy the world.  It's a conspiracy.  What kind of conspiracy?  I'll control the weather.  What's his partner?  Riff Raff?  Is that the guy? 
[00:31:30]  You're getting married.  No, no.  Here's Anthony from the Opie and Anthony Go to help you plan the perfect wedding.  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent, um, 300 bucks on it.  Right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother. 
[00:32:00]  Your son is a scumbag.  Eh, maybe not.  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one.  I believe, uh, I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of, of regret and sorrow rolling down the sides of my face.  Just follow these simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like, eh, eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke. 
[00:32:30]  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave.  Never marry a lot!  I was a broken, beaten man.  And I had been married for six hours.  But there's a car that's around next to me.  Without your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm willing!  You look fabulous!  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs.  Well done. 
[00:33:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Where's the croc, Connor?  Becky, contestant number 46 in the WOW Contest.  What's going on?  I thought you guys kicked me off.  I didn't know what number I was.  My girl freaked out.  Ah, you're still in, Becky.  You're still in.  Hey!  Sorry.  That's all right.  You can't curse there.  No, you're in, Becky.  All right.  All right.  If you're just tuning in, Ant and I just kicked ten girls out of the WOW Contest.  Just throw them out. 
[00:33:30]  Our guy's not here right now, so in the very near future, those girls will have their pictures  X'd out on OpieandAnthony.com.  All right.  Let's say hi to Steve and Terry.  Irwin.  Uh-oh.  Hey, Steve.  G'day, mate.  How are you?  Whoa.  How are you doing, Steve?  Over-modulating there.  What's going on, guys?  Oh, I don't know, Mike.  You tell me.  Where are you right now?  New York.  Oh, you're in New York.  Yeah, I'm in this big building here somewhere. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, there's a few of those here in the city.  Manhattan.  Somewhere in there.  Not many animals for you to wrestle in New York, huh?  I'll tell you what, mate.  The building I'm in, there's a lot of sharks, I've got to tell you.  Really?  Let's be the lawyers.  I'm thinking about becoming the pigeon hunter.  Hey, oh, is that not as exciting as the crocodiles, though?  No.  No.  Hey, you guys should have stopped by instead of doing this phone thing.  Yeah, all right. 
[00:34:30]  Where are you?  We're 57th and 7th.  Where are you?  I don't know.  Way downtown.  Oh, way downtown?  Someone said way downtown.  There's my publicist.  He's the one we should be stringing up.  All right, hold on.  We don't like publicists.  Yeah, neither do we.  And I'll tell you why.  Because the last time we were talking to you guys, they cut us off.  Did they?  Oh, exactly.  If you remember, we were asking Terry if she likes big crocs, and the publicist thought  that it was a little too edgy, a little too crazy, and they hung up and ended the interview  on us. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, they like that, mate.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, they handle you with kid gloves.  Yay.  Well, I tell you what they can't stop us from doing.  In our movie, The Crocodile Hunter Collision Course, I handle some real big crocs.  You do?  They are whoppers.  Now, I've been reading about this movie.  I saw the trailers for it.  Very exciting.  It seems to be almost like a Gilligan's Island plot, where the satellite gets swallowed by a  croc that you're trying to relocate, and you're being chased by who? 
[00:35:30]  Pouches.  Pouches.  Pouches.  And they're trying to kill this croc, but aren't you also being chased by people trying  to recover the satellite beacon?  That's right.  The CIA are hot in pursuit.  The CIA.  And what can we look forward to in you being chased by these guys?  Do you get them with your expertise out there in the bush?  Let me put it this way, mate.  No one mucks with my crocodile.  Oh, no one mucks with his crocodile.  And Steve doesn't have to use a gun.  He's got fully loaded venomous snakes in this movie. 
[00:36:00]  I bet he does.  He's a bird-eating spider.  He's like Dr. Doolittle.  He can almost talk with the animals and use them to help them out.  Is that what it is?  That's it, mate.  To a T.  The challenging part for Hollywood was the fact that all the animals are real.  That freaked them out a bit.  They were saying, you know, we use animatronics in movies.  And Steve's going, crikey, I don't.  I can't wrestle a CGI.  That's for sure.  Right.  This isn't an Ed Wood movie. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  Bingo.  Now, what do you do?  You do all your own stuff, obviously, because you do it on your TV show.  Yeah, mate.  It's like, they call it stunts.  I call it day-to-day work.  Yeah.  It must be even easier for you, though, in the movie, because don't these animals have  trainers and whatnot?  Oh, God, no, mate.  No way.  These are fully loaded, wild-caught crocodiles.  There's only one person on Earth that could jump on them and relocate them, and that's me.  Yeah, there's no trainers, mate. 
[00:37:00]  These are wild crocodiles.  So what did you do?  Did you film this all in Australia?  Yeah, the whole lot.  And we couldn't use, you know, for the crocodile sequences.  There's no such thing as take one, take two, bring on the crocodile.  This is all fair dinkum real crocs, mate.  And they had to set up banks of cameras, you know, some on tights and wide and this angle  and that angle, so as they could chop it all up.  Just in case you get killed, they'd want every angle on it.  Oh, well...  And that's why we couldn't get insured.  That's it.  We had to film all the crocodile action before we had a contract on the movie, 
[00:37:30]  because no one would cover us for insurance.  Yeah, that's all right.  You guys are raking in money hand over fist now.  I hope so.  You know, we've got some of the biggest conservation plans on the face of the Earth,  and unlike anybody else in Hollywood, every dollar we get out of this movie,  every one goes back to conservation.  And I hope we make a squillion.  A squillion?  Yeah, that's a big number.  That's like a bajillion.  That's like a bajillion.  It's bigger.  Steve.  Yes, mate?  How is it working with your wife all the time?  Oh, sensational, mate. 
[00:38:00]  And I actually get to work sleep with me partner.  Oh.  The co-star and the star.  And your wife doesn't mind?  Yeah, we do.  How do you reckon she got her job, mate?  I'm a trained professional.  Yeah, and Terry, you ever worry about Steve doing this stuff?  I mean, come on.  I've seen these crocs take bites at him and missed by mere inches.  Yeah, they seem to do that.  Steve's got a real gift with wildlife, and I've seen him, you know,  not more than once a week am I worried that he's going to die.  So that's pretty good.  But he's the real deal, and I'm so excited about this movie 
[00:38:30]  because he's like the real-life action hero.  You know, he's the guy people make movies about.  Right.  So, you know, I worry about him,  but it's awful hard to land a macho guy that's also nice.  I'll say.  You know?  Hey, Steve, what's the worst injury you've gotten?  Mate, I've had to have some pretty severe shoulder surgery.  I smashed my shoulder jumping on this crocodile that was sitting on a rock,  and so I got it, you know, I got all the bone and stuff pulled out. 
[00:39:00]  And then, even worse than that, I was in East Timor.  There was a war going on there,  and they sent me in to catch a couple of their crocs that were being mistreated.  And when I jumped in on the croc, he went into a death roll.  Uh-oh.  And almost pulled my shoulder out of its socket,  so they had to cut the tendon out.  So I'd say my shoulder's the worst actual surgery and injury.  But the thing that plagues me the most is my right knee.  I had four cartilage operations, 
[00:39:30]  and right in the middle of the movie,  I had to have a go and have another cartilage operation  because when we were putting this big 12-foot croc in the boat,  just me and Terry and Suey,  he spun around and bang, ripped up what little cartilage I had left.  And without a word of a lie, guys,  the crocodile in East Timor that injured Steve so badly was named Anthony.  Ah, see, great name for a crocodile.  That's it.  Oh, he was a big angry boy, too, mate.  Did they ever find it like having sex with two other crocodiles?  Oh, yeah, doctor. 
[00:40:00]  No.  We did have a beautiful little Sheila.  We rescued her, too.  A Sheila.  Do these animals have any loyalty at all?  Or do they have, like, dogs or whatever,  mammals have some recognition?  Do they have any at all?  Not towards people, no, not at all.  Even though I rescue them,  they think I'm trying to hurt them and they try to kill me.  But they sure are good lovers with each other.  You know, and big male, dominant male crocodiles are great fathers  and very territorial and protective of their girls and their young. 
[00:40:30]  And you guys might not be familiar with this, so I'll say it slowly,  but the male crocodile goes through what's called foreplay  with the female crocodile sometimes for hours.  I get it.  I get it.  Us men aren't into that.  No, but he does a lot of bubble blowing.  Oh.  Comes up and down her.  He's very gentle with her.  It's a beautiful thing.  Who's bubble?  They're amazing.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  It's also beautiful when they lunge out of that river 
[00:41:00]  and take down one of those big, what are they,  what are those things, those, uh...  Oh, they'll take down...  They're like water buffalo or something.  Water buffalo, man.  They are unbelievable.  Yeah, buffalo, wild pigs.  Virtually anything that goes down to the water  is considered as a food source.  And you know, whenever he targets a big animal like that,  the first thing he does after killing it  is he shows his girlfriend.  Oh, exactly.  So go, check it out.  I killed this big thing.  And she's like, oh, you're cool.  Here he is stalking a golfer.  Draught at the edge of a lake.  Those are a little squishy.  I guess so. 
[00:41:30]  Well, you know something?  I could watch those goddamn crocs  taking down those water buffaloes for hours.  You see them come up to the edge of the lake or river  and they start taking that little drink  and you're like, uh-oh.  Here he comes.  Yeah, exactly.  Here he comes.  Honey.  And so quick.  And then you look at someone like Steve  and it's like, that's a tidbit.  Yeah.  That's a little tidbit.  And there you are in your little shorts.  Are you wearing those shorts  through the whole movie, Steve?  Oh, absolutely, mate.  It's all I heard.  I like the way he wears the shorts  and then even when he's diving in the lake  to go underwater for something,  you've still got your goddamn shorts and boots on. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, mate.  When you're filming stuff,  you know, you just don't...  You don't think.  You're just doing it.  Like, I'm on a total rescue.  So, it's boots and all, mate.  No matter what's going on,  you just get in there and do the job.  One of my favorite scenes ever,  Steve Irwin on the back of a Land Rover  or whatever kind of vehicle you guys drive  and Terry's driving  and you have a rope  and you're trying to rope an animal.  A camel.  A camel.  And you missed with the rope  and for some reason you lost the rope 
[00:42:30]  so you made Terry drive right next to the camel  and you jumped off onto the camel's neck.  Yeah.  One of my favorites ever.  That was when I looked and went,  this guy is out of his effing mind.  Yeah, it's true.  I am.  How's this, mate?  Straight after that,  I jump back on  and Terry slams me into the only tree  in the desert and tears...  It wasn't the only tree.  It was the only tree.  But you tore my ear in half.  Really?  Your ear got torn in half?  Torn in half, mate.  And the only thing that stopped the bleeding  was camel poop. 
[00:43:00]  Camel poop will stop the bleeding if you...  And it's not like I wanted to put it in there  but when you try to get a camel onto the ground,  you run the rope around their legs  and then you tackle them around the back end  and so your ear sticks right in their bottom.  Right.  So that stopped the bleeding.  You know, Jim Norton paid $270 for that treatment  the other night with a young lady  but that's a whole other story.  Apparently my face was bleeding.  Boy, did he need a top jaw rope? 
[00:43:30]  Steve, Terry, when's the movie come out?  This Friday, mate.  Friday night.  This Friday.  Yeah.  Very excited.  It's a collision course.  When I saw the trailer for it,  I'm like,  what the hell is Steve doing?  Yeah, mate.  You want to get stoked full of adrenaline  and passion and laugh.  You're living daylights out  and then go to the movie, mate.  It looks like it's going to be hilarious.  It's a lot of fun.  I love the idea that finally when Steve,  you know,  hopefully it's not for quite a while  but I'm pretty sure a guy like you  would want to go out like this.  When the croc finally bites you in half, 
[00:44:00]  there'll be plenty of cameras rolling  so we can watch it again and again.  You can be sure of that.  All right, Steve.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, mate.  Thanks very much.  Good luck.  Get the movie.  Sure.  Friday.  Thanks, guys.  Oh, Steve?  There they are.  Big movie stars now.  Steve and Terry Irwin.  I just hate,  I don't like any animal  that doesn't show your loyalty  if you're feeding it  over a long period of time.  They're a goddamn dinosaur, Jim.  I don't care what it is.  A crocodile has nothing for a brain. 
[00:44:30]  Really?  It runs on pure instinct.  The reason it survived for so long  is that it doesn't have  those stupid things  like us mammals have.  It's a cold, scaly dinosaur.  That's probably because  it lives in the water  and we don't do much in the water.  And it's in remote areas.  Nobody, we don't need,  I just don't like them.  The longest surviving animals  on this planet  are the ones that don't care.  They don't have, you know,  I know Steve and Terry  talking about how,  ah, the foreplay,  oh, it's wonderful.  He blows bubbles on.  He'd just as soon 
[00:45:00]  bite his bitch in half  if he's hungry.  They don't have this love thing.  They like to make it  like the animals,  look how romantic he is.  Look at him blowing  bubbles all over a body.  And then,  ah, two seconds later,  wow, he ripped our guts open  and he's eating it.  Well, that is kind of romantic.  It's the animals  that don't let their guard down.  Right.  That's survival wise.  That's it.  They eat,  they crap,  and they make little sharks.  Yeah, sharks.  The water.  We're not in the middle  of the ocean.  Sharks are eating machines. 
[00:45:30]  That's all they care about.  I'd love to know  how long whales  have been around  because,  but then again,  they're hunted.  Yeah.  Sharks have been around  longer than the whales.  Oh, of course they have,  but they're just evolution.  Things in the water  do have an advantage  because we're not really  in there a lot.  We're not building in the water.  We pollute it.  We do things,  but there's plenty of water  on this planet.  That's what it is.  But like I said,  with a crocodile,  though,  they don't care.  That's why I don't like them.  They don't care.  You can't pet it.  You can raise a crocodile  and play kissy face  with that thing  from the time  it's that little, 
[00:46:00]  like two inches long  until the time  it's 18 feet long.  And you know something?  If it gets hungry,  it will chew  your smiling face off.  That's why  enough with saving them.  For what?  At least mammals,  I mean even lions  or whatever  can be trained.  They're vicious,  but you can pet them  and hang with them  after you feed them.  They're a little more  up the scale.  A lot more up the scale.  They're ugly.  There you go.  That's our animal segment  for today.  That's our animal segment.  I'm Brian Fellow.  I don't like that crocodile. 
[00:46:30]  He's trying to buy stuff  with my credit card.  When are we getting  Tracy Morgan back on the show?  I don't know.  It's time to get  Tracy Morgan back on the show.  Weather conspiracy guy  on the way, Anthony.  Wonderful.  He's got a conspiracy theory  about the government  controlling weather.  Is that it, Rick?  Great.  I love kooks like this.  Yes, so we'll talk  to him next.  Also a girl on line three.  I don't know what city  she's calling from.  Shelly.  She just found out that  balloon knot sex  is illegal in her town 
[00:47:00]  and she's really bummed  and she wants to talk  to us about it.  All right.  And don't forget,  tomorrow on the program,  Tippi Tom.  The return of Tippi Tom.  I can't wait.  A huge surprise  for Tippi Tom tomorrow.  This was my father  and you think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby.  Let me know.  Lonely?  You're damn right.  Looking for the time  of your life?  Are you single?  Hygiene, not an issue.  Hepatitis C,  which I've had  for 20 years.  Sit back,  lube up, 
[00:47:30]  and dial Tippi Tom.  I'm a slut.  He's homeless,  smells like a dumpster,  and he's horny.  Can you lick my b***h?  For a bottle of Thunderbird,  he's all yours.  I'm a human being.  I want a b***h guy.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot  when I was two years old.  Girls.  I have girlfriends, too.  He's so drunk,  he doesn't care.  All right, who's next?  Just name the place,  and he'll be there.  We're behind a dumpster 
[00:48:00]  or something like that.  Call 1-900-SYPHILIS  for the ride of your life.  I know how to shake my fag.  Not responsible  for any diseases contracted  as a result of sex  with Bippy Tom.  You're damn right.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  I pity the people  that are in front of me  when I come out  of the battery tunnel  and I have this blast,  and I pity the people  that are in front of me.  Leanna Field.  When's the new  Disturbed album coming out?  Huh?  June. 
[00:48:30]  June?  Soon.  Soon.  I thought he said June.  Soon.  A few weeks?  A little listening party  to go to,  ain't it, Ben?  They don't send us  the records anymore?  Bastards.  They used to send us  the records in advance,  now we have to go  to, like, a room.  Yeah, we gotta go  to a room  at the record company  to listen to the albums now.  That's all right.  Do they frisk you  for a dad player?  Yeah.  They do.  They wand us  and everything.  We wrecked,  we ruin everything 
[00:49:00]  for ourselves.  I love to be able  to pop on  some new Disturbed.  Paul Mercurio,  what's going on, bro?  Hey.  What's going on, guys?  Paul kicked ass  at Caroline's last night.  Had a great time.  Thanks, man.  Very funny.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah, the place was packed.  It was packed,  and Anthony was there  with Melinda,  and the gang was there,  and Mary and Rachel  and Mike did an awesome job  handing out stickers,  and Mary serviced  the doorman,  which was great.  Stop it. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, it was really cool,  and you guys totally  set me up last week.  You know I've supported  you in the past.  I'm just giving you a hard time.  I know you were home  mending your white socks.  I understand.  I've seen you two or three times.  Very funny guy.  I just,  I've been incognito lately.  I understand.  I haven't been out  and about in a long time.  I'm just giving you a hard time.  No, I called  out of total sincerity.  Thank you, guys,  because you totally  hooked me up  and promoted the thing,  and it really helped  a huge amount.  Cool.  Because it was totally packed.  It was sold out.  The club was digging it, 
[00:50:00]  and no small part to you guys,  so I really appreciate it.  I had the worst waitress  in the world last night.  I had the worst goddamn waitress.  Caroline's, let me tell you,  they always take care of me,  so I never have a problem  at Caroline's.  Last night,  the worst waitress ever.  What happened?  I sat down,  and the guy that was  hosting the show,  what was his name?  He was really good.  Buddy Fitzpatrick.  Buddy Fitzpatrick.  Yeah.  And he's hosting the show,  and so I sit down 
[00:50:30]  well before the show starts.  You didn't want to sit  near the front of the stage.  You had a table for me?  No, they had a table for me.  Right.  Front and center?  Right.  I'm like, no,  we will sit in the back.  In the back.  And they also had  a throne chair for him,  Opie.  He had them in the back.  No, I didn't want to.  I'm not the up front guy.  Well, 4 o'clock in the afternoon,  I get a call  from the manager at Caroline  saying,  Anthony called from his cell  something about a throne.  Yeah, I wanted the throne  in the front.  Would you stop?  And it had to be bronze  with cross swords 
[00:51:00]  and I don't know.  No, so anyway, no,  he was very low key.  He was in the back  hanging out.  I'm in the back.  So the waitress  didn't come over  to the table  until he was done  with his first sit.  So that's like,  and you sit down  before the show starts.  So that's like  almost a half hour  without a drink.  Meaning,  I'm sitting there like,  it's going through withdrawals.  I'm going through withdrawals.  You're shaking bad.  Yeah, I had started drinking  yesterday at what?  3 o'clock.  So I was in the morning.  And I was like, 
[00:51:30]  I was getting,  you know what it is?  It's not even the point  that I want my drink now.  I was getting like,  why the,  and I'm not even talking about,  hey, I'm Anthony.  No, no.  Anybody that's sitting in a club  should have a waitress come by  and take your order  or at least say,  I'll be right with you  within the first 20 minutes.  And like I said,  Caroline,  this has never happened.  But I was getting  so goddamn frustrated  that, you know,  I was very pissed off.  I had a horrid waitress. 
[00:52:00]  But I won't say her name  so she doesn't get fired.  Then you look back  over the records  and check and find out  who she was  because I'm saying it.  You're Anthony.  You should get served quick.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you.  Caroline had a meeting  and said,  we're going to get Anthony  to come in,  but we're not going  to serve him anything.  And if he wants  to go to the bathroom,  bar him from the bathroom.  He was going to,  I can't use that word anyway.  So anyway, thanks.  I'll let you guys  do your thing.  I just,  you guys are awesome  and I appreciate it.  And Mary and the gang 
[00:52:30]  was like totally great  in the van.  Enough ass kissing, Paul.  All right.  Oh, God.  See, you can't take,  people can't be nice to you.  Couldn't have done it  without them.  Shut up.  Shut up,  you freakish lesbian.  Shut up.  Thanks to you.  Yeah, thanks.  I'd like to thank  the Academy.  All right,  I'm going to go.  Are you holding your Emmy  right now?  He's holding his Emmy.  He is.  I'm holding my Emmy  and I'm wearing  my Kathleen Turner shirt.  I'll see you guys.  Thanks a lot.  All right, Paul.  Paul Mercurio, everyone.  Thank my parents  and thank God  and thank Opie and Anthony 
[00:53:00]  and thank you, Mary.  Look at the ticket.  Look at the ticket for last night.  Look at what it says  over his name.  Emmy Award winner.  No, it doesn't.  It does.  No, it doesn't.  It was on the ticket.  No, it's not.  It's on the ticket.  No, it's not.  I'm not looking.  No, it's not.  Emmy Award winner.  No, it is.  Tuesday, July 9, 2002.  Emmy Award winner,  Paul Mercurio.  Right.  Hey, why not?  It's right on the ticket.  No, it's not.  Why not?  Look.  No.  Look.  I can't take care of it. 
[00:53:30]  It's not on the ticket.  I'm looking straight ahead.  Was he working with the megaphone  or without it last night?  He didn't have the megaphone.  They gave him a mic.  A mic?  Yeah.  Impressive.  Hey, Shelly?  Yes.  Hey.  Hello.  Where are you calling from?  I'm in the Cleveland area.  Okay.  I was calling because  a friend of mine,  Katie, and I  were online today  looking for a  credit card fraud law  and we came across  a website  called dumblaws.com. 
[00:54:00]  Dumblaws.com, yes.  How old are you, Shelly?  I found out that  in Pennsylvania...  Wait, wait, wait.  Shelly, how old are you?  23.  23, okay.  And you found out  in Cincinnati  that violating  someone's balloon nut  is actually illegal.  Illegal.  It is illegal.  Cincinnati is awful.  And only Cincinnati?  Only Cincinnati.  I don't know.  I think there's  other sodomy laws  in other states.  I think in most states  it's illegal.  Yeah.  It's a damn shame.  That's the only city  in Ohio  that it's listing.  Cincinnati stinks. 
[00:54:30]  And that bothers you?  No.  No, we just found it  interesting  and I don't live  in Cincinnati  so it's okay.  Are you going to stop?  March shot  on the red.  She's an awful racist  but you can't stick it  in a friend's balloon nut.  What an awful town.  And that's where  they shot Flint.  Shelly, do you do it?  That's nuts.  That's a little more  information than I thought  is there.  Do you or don't?  Don't with the TMI.  She does it.  That's a little  too much information.  As soon as someone  answers a question 
[00:55:00]  like that  you know they do it.  You do it, right?  Sure.  She does it.  Yeah.  She said sure.  Do you like?  Yeah, you enjoy it?  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  So there's times  that it's being done  that you don't enjoy it?  Well, sometimes  more than others.  Do you ever bury  your face in the pillow  and think of your dad  hanging his head in shame  while you're receiving that?  Illegally, you criminal.  I try not to think  of my dad  when I'm having sex.  Yeah, that's got to be  an awful thing, man.  That's a little disturbing.  Hey, I got an idea, kids. 
[00:55:30]  Everyone having sex  tonight, think of your dad.  Oh.  That's got to be awful  though for a girl.  Just putting that thought  out there, I guarantee  a bunch of people  will think of their dad  tonight when they're having sex.  You know what's worse?  I've come to the point  where I can't get a rod  without a shit.  Think about old dad  tonight when you're  having sex.  Don't have to think much.  He's right in the room  with me.  Peg team.  Yelling, slow down,  slow down.  It's been a while.  All right, Shelly.  That's got to be horrible.  Okay, thanks.  You guys are great.  Too much information. 
[00:56:00]  We're hoping to get  20 minutes of material  out of you,  but I don't think  it's going to happen.  No, I'm not that interesting.  We're going to move on.  All right, Shelly.  Thanks.  That's got to happen  with girls though.  You know how guilty  girls are about sex?  Some girls.  You know,  especially with the  upbringing when they're  just, you know,  maybe they're making  that jump to the  balloon knot action  and the guy climbs  aboard and starts  going to town  and all of a sudden  I thought of,  oh God,  my daddy,  what if,  oh, what if he knew  right now I was  getting it like this? 
[00:56:30]  That's horrible.  Especially if he's wearing  the cologne like he's  wearing, say,  Old Spice or English  leather.  One of those dad colognes.  The same one her dad  used to wear,  a brute.  Karate.  What's that?  High karate.  High karate.  And the guy,  as he's like giving that  kiss around the side  of her neck because  her face is in the pillow,  the whiskers rub on  her cheek just like  daddy's used to when  he kissed her goodbye  for school.  Breath smells a little  like rum. 
[00:57:00]  Teddy, what's up?  A little bourbon  on the breath.  Any minute now  you're waiting for him  to say,  towards the night  before Christmas,  reads a little story  on his knee.  You get that  little stubble.  Teddy!  Hey, what's going on?  So big, so fast.  God damn it. 
[00:57:30]  Smell a cheap bourbon  and a high karate.  Can you take a little  more?  Quarter for a quarter.  50 cents for half a dollar  if I get it all.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, 
[00:58:00]  get one on.  Hey, Teddy.  Yo, what's going on?  What's up, Teddy?  It's illegal in New York  as well.  Illegal?  I think it's illegal  everywhere.  Yeah.  And speaking of violating  the chocolate starfish,  your buddy Mario Cantone  just walked by.  Would you stop it?  Hey, Norton.  Hey, Norton.  Oh, stop.  Just stop it.  I'm too good.  I'm too sharp.  I'm too well defined. 
[00:58:30]  Amateur.  Physically.  Let's go to D.C.  Rank amateur.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Scott, is that me?  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I'm not sure if you knew this, but according to the Uniform Code of Military Justice,  it is illegal to do anything but the missionary position.  For what?  Military people?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  No, I'm not kidding, man.  Wow.  Really?  Is balloon art action allowed in the barracks?  I'm sure there's a website, but you'll find it.  They're paying for it.  You'll watch it.  All right.  Thank you, Scott.  Thanks, Scott. 
[00:59:00]  Bye.  Hey, we got the dice prank calls.  Doesn't even have the common courtesy to give them a reach around.  Yeah.  I'll be watching you.  Oh, the dice calls?  We got a couple of these finally?  Yeah, I think the balloon art sex thing isn't going anywhere, so.  Yeah.  We got to waste about three more minutes.  We take a break, and then we got the weather conspiracy guy.  Oh, I can't wait.  And then we got the wacko jacko is a freak-o thing.  Wacko jacko is a freak-o.  That's the post, not us.  Yes.  That was a bad one.  There you go. 
[00:59:30]  He sucks, man.  He's so good at it.  I hate him.  I have to look.  I thought you might actually have something for the show that you were going to start.  Nope.  I'm just kind of gliding along.  Whatever you guys are doing, I'm with you.  It's not about me.  I'm just hanging.  All right.  Rick has had some extra time on his hands.  Mm-hmm.  And he's been pranking some people with the Dice soundboard.  With Dice.  We have a lot of Dice clips, man. 
[01:00:00]  Where were these dudes who just, the day he was in on the air here?  No, so far it's like three different appearances where he was actually in studio.  I've been trolling for a little drop from him.  Because I heard they're very clear.  Oh, yeah.  So it's not like the person on the other end is going to be tipped on.  Right.  All right.  And these people, who are they?  I heard a lot of Chinese people.  Yeah, I did some Chinese restaurants today.  Chinese people would be the good marks.  They're the easiest ones.  I told him he's got to step it up and he's got to just call it down south. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  The southern people will go with it, too.  I got to get used to it first.  They're just as stupid as the Chinese people.  Right.  Are we on in the south?  Nolans.  Nolans.  Oops.  What?  They're pretty stupid.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that true?  No, they're cool.  Very.  All right, so here are the first three.  We've got plenty more to come.  Yes.  All right.  Let's check out this one. 
[01:01:00]  Thank you for calling Avocats.  May I help you?  Tommy!  Hello?  Tommy!  Yeah, how are you?  Tommy!  You got your money?  Tommy!  Yes.  What do you want?  You got a boyfriend.  Why aren't you talking now?  McFly!  Wake up, McFly!  Hi.  Tommy!  Who the f*** are you?  That's, uh, that's, uh, uh, male harassment.  All right.  All right.  Good start.  We're getting there. 
[01:01:30]  Bruce, that's a map here?  Tommy!  Hello?  Tommy!  Who's calling?  Tony Slangini.  Tommy?  Tony Slangini.  That's a Bruce guy.  Chinese investor.  Do sexy.  Come on.  If you're a filthy slob.  That's a Bruce guy.  Chinese investor.  What's your problem with people?  That's a Bruce guy.  Chinese investor.  Why are you talking now?  What are you talking now?  Man, everything's going on. 
[01:02:00]  You got issues, sweetheart.  You got to talk sexy, baby.  You got to put a certain tone in your voice.  You know that.  No, no, you're a wrong number.  That's, uh, that's, uh, male harassment.  That's a wrong number.  I go right to your neck like an animal.  You're a filthy slob.  Yeah, wrong number, sir.  Sorry.  You got me mad last week.  You're a filthy slob.  What are you talking?  Don't question it.  Why aren't you talking now?  I'm sure.  That's a business phone.  That's a Bruce guy.  Chinese.  Why are you tongue-tied? 
[01:02:30]  Sorry, I don't understand you.  Sorry, sir.  Why are you tongue-tied?  Don't understand you're a restaurant.  Boy, a restaurant's a hard word for them, huh?  Yeah.  A restaurant.  One more.  I'm late.  Tommy.  Yeah.  Tommy.  Tommy?  Well, I don't know.  Tommy.  You got your money, Tommy?  No, I don't have any money.  You got calling the right number? 
[01:03:00]  You got a boyfriend?  Yes.  Who's sexy?  Come on.  Who's this?  Tony Slangini.  Yeah, I don't know you, man.  You filthy slob.  Yeah.  You got me mad last week.  Yeah, what's up with the number?  You better check your number, bro.  I go right to your neck like an animal.  Yeah.  Call the...  You got to call the right number.  I'm going to let it go.  All right.  That's...  That's...  Male harassment.  Yep. 
[01:03:30]  I'm not afraid to say I like other men.  All right.  That's a pretty good start.  That's a good start.  Good clips to work with.  Yeah.  I think...  Oh, it's right, though.  Down south.  Down south.  We need a little more interaction, right?  What you talking about, shitty boy?  You concrete walker.  We also have to get Dice on the phone so we can get more clips.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's been a while.  We got to get the Dice Man on.  Yeah!  Tommy!  He blew me off. 
[01:04:00]  I wanted that barbecue in L.A.  And you never got it.  Never got the barbecue.  Did he ever return your call?  No.  No?  The big blow-off.  What's he got going?  What's he doing now?  I think he was in Vegas, but...  Oh, was he?  Okay.  But he never called back to say he was going to be in Vegas instead of cooking for me.  Like yesterday, I was having breakfast over there, like...  And today, I'm having the same kind of breakfast, almost like that breakfast happened at that moment.  The way you would have things done back then.  All right, Anthony? 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  Our guy is back.  You go to opianthony.com and you can see the ten girls we knocked out of the WOW Contest.  Oh, we can now see that?  Yeah.  Just out of nowhere, we decided we needed to get rid of ten girls to make room for more hot chicks.  All right.  If you weren't listening earlier, Las Vegas promising us 30 girls tomorrow for the WOW Contest.  So, we got the X's across their pictures, let's just say.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm seeing...  Yeah, okay.  First one, right.  Oh, he's doing it as we're talking, so... 
[01:05:00]  All right.  We just screwed him up.  Now everyone's going to slam the site.  Hey, weather conspiracy guy next?  Oh, I can't wait.  He's ready to go, you think?  I got to call him.  You got to call him?  Okay, we'll break.  I love tooling on these people.  I love, like, playing right into their fears when they say what they're paranoid of.  Because this guy, it's obviously paranoia.  Then you just kind of say, yeah.  You agree with him?  Oh, what?  You're starting to agree, Jim?  This guy...  You think there's a conspiracy?  This guy seems to be well-educated. 
[01:05:30]  Well-educated?  Yeah.  Conspiracy to do what, though?  It doesn't mean...  Every time now, be careful.  Because sometimes when you say the word conspiracy, people automatically think, ah, you're enough.  But conspiracy at times does mean something valid.  I don't know.  No, we'll talk to him.  I want to find out.  Conspiracy theories stink.  Not always.  Well, name one.  Kennedy.  That's right.  It's accurate.  What part of it?  The fact that it was a conspiracy, which means more than one.  Oh, yeah.  It was definitely more than one.  Yeah.  So that was accurate.  The UFO cover-up, I believe, that there's a certain amount of UFO cover-up. 
[01:06:00]  That UFO stuff, I'm just not buying.  Dude, I know.  Back in the day, man, when I was a kid, I ate that up, man.  I loved UFOs, everything to do with it.  And then as you get older and you're more educated, you realize most of those sightings  were back in the 40s, 50s, 60s.  We were playing with all kinds of fun toys back then.  Did you hear about that nuclear?  We were trying to make, this country was trying to build a flying saucer. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know what they wanted to do with it.  Maybe just freak people in the Soviet Union out.  But the engine for this thing was a nuclear reactor.  And they'd fly it around the desert, just irradiating people and pretty much killing them.  Giving them cancer.  Like, days later, their skin would be peeling.  And they'd tell this story about...  Where do you get your info on this?  Conspiracy theories.  That sounds like a conspiracy theory.  No, this was one of those shows on the History Channel or Discovery when they look at military  secrets that have been declassified.  And they were trying to make a flying saucer. 
[01:07:00]  My problem is military guys that call in, like military pilots that see things.  Not dopes like us who don't know what they're working on.  But they're like real military pilots that see things.  Yeah, but even they don't know.  You know something?  When they're flying around air bases, that's where a lot of this stuff happens.  You know, they have that Area 51 out there where they were building all kinds of aircraft.  You think back at what the stealth bomber and the stealth fighter looks like now.  It was descriptions of these bat-winged UFOs. 
[01:07:30]  There was a time they had to fly these things around to, you know, test them out before they  told everyone.  My helicopters weren't commonplace in the 40s.  And when they saw something hovering in the air with lights on it, they didn't know what  the hell it was.  They never saw an aircraft fly like that.  Things like the National Weather Service.  Again, you're right.  There's a lot of them are mistaken.  But the National Weather Service, I've actually heard the transmission of a guy who had tracked  something that was making movements that there's no way that we're able to make. 
[01:08:00]  We're not able to move at 1,000 miles an hour, stop, go down.  Yeah, I've heard about those, too.  That's the stuff that I wonder about.  I don't know.  It could be just a meteor glitch in the equipment.  Not if it's being spotted by a pilot or a cop.  Okay, Art Bell.  No, I'm not.  I don't.  Oh, please.  I love Art Bell, by the way.  But I'll say that a lot of the guys, yes, aren't complete asses.  They really are.  And a thing came out and I talked to it.  Really?  Is that what happened?  You dope.  Those are great. 
[01:08:30]  They always got to give you the A-probe, too.  They always got to shove one up there.  Well, if you're lucky.  I like to hear the guy.  I heard a guy about Area 51 who really was credible.  He was admitting, nah, I didn't see that.  Nah, that never happened.  But really credible with certain things.  Area 51 is nothing more than a place that the military built secret aircraft.  So, of course, it's going to be classified.  You're not going to want people around it.  And you're going to see things in the air that you might not see at the local airport.  But there is an area of Area 51 which is supposed to exist.  They always said, no, it doesn't. 
[01:09:00]  They always deny this existence.  Hangar 18.  Well, I don't know if that's what it's called.  But you have to drive to it.  There's a bus, a blacked-out window bus.  And they actually photographed the road that they said existed.  A satellite photo was actually taken.  It's a classified compound.  Of course it's going to have its secrets.  But not because of spacemen.  Maybe.  Eric?  Latou.  Hey, Eric.  Gordon, you rule.  Thanks, Eric.  Sure.  Hey, guys.  What about the conspiracy theory about us being on the moon?  I love this one.  Idiotic. 
[01:09:30]  We were there.  That's moronic.  Pictures prove it.  No, they don't.  No, it doesn't.  They discounted every one of these conspiracies about the shadows being different.  What about the flag was blown in the wind?  That's right.  There's no air back there.  There's no air on the moon.  Something to do with the material of the flag.  I read about that.  And there's one shot on the moon.  What material?  Polyester?  Wait, hold on.  I'm explaining to you.  There was a thing where the guy jumped in the air.  And they're like, see, the shadow was off by four feet.  If he was standing there, and they didn't know he was leaping when the photo was taken.  Yeah.  He wasn't on the ground. 
[01:10:00]  Why would we fake that?  Someone would have came out by now.  Because we were competing with Russia.  Why hasn't anyone talked, Eric?  They can't find one guy that was part of that.  And you'd have a conspiracy.  They're all dead or silent.  No, they're not.  They don't have tongues out.  It only happened 30-some-odd years ago.  Some conspiracies are very accurate, but this one I think people are wrong on.  I've read both sides, and I think that they're wrong.  Clinton knows the truth, right, about the aliens.  Why doesn't he talk?  Clinton knows.  I saw the cover of the Weekly World News.  He was shaking hands with one.  I love that one. 
[01:10:30]  And presidents are not made privy to that.  They're seen as transient figures.  They're not seen as really on the inside.  They're not made privy to that information.  Later, guys.  All right.  Later, man.  All right.  Man, we opened up a can of worms here.  Yeah, I want to check in with a hotel with Eric and talk this out.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey, I disagree wholeheartedly with Anthony.  You have to be very naive to think that there is no such thing as UFOs.  Oh, I hear when people say that, too.  All the UFOs is an unidentified flying object.  Of course they exist.  It's unidentified.  Whether they're flying saucers from other planets, you know, I have a problem with that. 
[01:11:00]  Ever since the invention of the videotape recorder, the evidence is indisputable that they are real.  Yeah, I made one, too, when I first got my camcorder.  It consisted of a pot lid thrown up in the air, and it looked really good.  It's not indisputable, though.  No, no, there's a book called The Gulf Breeze Sightings.  Area 51, really, a lot of that stuff that you say about the military testing is true.  But a lot of it was also leaked to make people believe that that's what they were doing to cover up the reality, you know, what was really going on. 
[01:11:30]  That's what they say, too.  See, they wanted you to think it's just a military installation.  Where are all the great...  I've watched every goddamn UFO show.  I love when they come on Fox and all those things.  UFOs exposed.  Oh, my God.  Video evidence that will make you believe.  I'm like, I'm caught up in it.  I'm like, finally, you know something?  Camcorders, everyone's got them.  No matter what happens, if a black guy's getting his face shoved in the trunk of a cop car, goddammit, there's a video camera there to show it. 
[01:12:00]  With all the video cameras, there's got to be indisputable evidence of UFOs.  I have not seen one goddamn thing that is like, oh, my God, this guy got a UFO.  It's still the shake.  It might as well be 8-millimeter film.  It's still shaky.  There's not the clear shot of a UFO.  Well, Mike has one.  Mike, go.  What are you talking about?  There are plenty of shots, especially when they do the Gulf Breeze shot.  They're in the eclipse in Mexico City.  It's like, it was incredible. 
[01:12:30]  The sky was full of them.  I saw that one.  No, it's not clear.  Where is that?  Which one was this?  Hold on, hold on.  There are lights in the sky.  You cannot photograph a light object with a camera that traps light.  That's what I'm saying.  Where's the goddamn video clip of an actual ship?  I don't want to see lights.  Have you seen the one that the Israeli jet fighter is chasing?  Have you seen that one?  No, that one I have not seen.  Have you seen the one where one shoots at another one and blows it up?  There are plenty of videos.  And the Area 51, though, I have to agree with you, that it most likely was one of ours. 
[01:13:00]  It was small enough, and the same impact problems.  If a pilot depressurizes, the human head will expand.  There's always a goddamn video camera there when a guy tees off a golf ball and it goes  into his friend's sack.  There's always a camera there.  Where the hell is the flying saucer video?  How many pre...  This is my thing.  I don't know if they exist.  I think they do, but who knows.  How many pre-real technology accounts are there?  Like, as technology goes on, they said that the reports have gotten almost like a change 
[01:13:30]  with technology has changed.  How many pre, like, say, Industrial Revolution reports were there?  Oh, like when there were just sailing ships and whatnot.  When there was nothing that we made that could have done it.  I would love to know.  How many through history, back over hundreds of years?  Yeah, until we were able to fly, all of a sudden then there was all these...  Even in an old historic painting, there's an old Renaissance painting, and you've got  this major painting where the beautiful figure is, and in the background there's a boy and  a dog, and he's staring up in the air, and he's looking at a UFO. 
[01:14:00]  That's possible?  All right, I'm just asking.  During the Renaissance.  I love the way those...  Photoshop!  No, it was painted by, like, one of those...  Dude, I love how those are interpreted.  Remember a show, it was called...  Hold on, I'm with them on that.  You see some of those primitive cave drawings and stuff, and you see stuff that looks like  they could be UFOs.  I watched a show called Ancient Astronauts.  Remember that?  It was out a long time ago.  And...  What about the landing strip?  Right.  That was made before we flew.  They fly over it, and it's like, oh my God, this is like a primitive airport. 
[01:14:30]  On these Egyptian hieroglyphics, we see what appears to be a man in a rocket ship.  No, he was sitting in a chair.  A man in hieroglyphics, like a chiseled out thing in stone, he's sitting in a chair, and  behind him is fire.  And that's supposed to convince me, oh, well, there's a spaceship.  No, it's some kind of mythological thing of a guy that's, you know, he was sitting on  the sun.  It doesn't necessarily mean spaceships were coming down. 
[01:15:00]  Well, there was a map that they found, and this is, you know, a thousand years or whatever,  and it was a very inaccurate map, but it was perfectly accurate from 10,000 feet.  Things like that kind of bother me.  There's no way somebody could have had that point of view to make it.  But it took in the curvature of the Earth.  Not only that, it was from 10,000 feet above Antarctica.  Oh, is that where it was?  Okay, but you know what I'm talking about.  Because what they did was they had a picture of it before it was totally iced over or something 
[01:15:30]  like that, and they, like, re-examined it, and they saw that the actual landline matches  what they had drawn.  I'm not saying it couldn't happen, and there isn't life somewhere, or all that happy horse  crap.  All I'm saying is there is no evidence that anyone right now can look at and say, okay,  it's guaranteed there have been visits from other planets and UFOs.  There's nothing that can solidly convince anybody. 
[01:16:00]  I know.  That's all.  Well, they're not releasing it if they have it.  Well, back to the conspiracy thing.  Hey, let's everybody write a letter.  Well, the phones have explored, so we'll continue with this a little bit.  And weather conspiracy guy up next, right?  Yep.  All right, cool.  And we've got to get into the Michael Jackson thing today.  Wacko Jacko.  And we also want to talk more about Ted Williams' head.  Of course.  Can I hear the daughter?  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  Now the WOW report. 
[01:16:30]  Sources close to Opie and Anthony say that the WOW sticker is your guarantee of plump,  firm breasts.  We found out different.  Let's go to the tape.  Hey, look at this.  Jesus.  One doesn't work for you?  Whip him out Wednesday.  Risky, but usually worth it.  Get your WOW sticker today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Very busy, so let's get right to it.  We've got a weather conspiracy guy on the line.  His name is Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, guys.  How you doing? 
[01:17:00]  Jim with the last name I can't pronounce.  How are you?  Laranaca.  Yeah, pretty good.  All right.  So, where do we start here?  You have a book?  Yeah, I've written a book called The Dead Farmer's Almanac, which actually is fiction.  It started as a novel I had written with the premise being that the government controls  the weather, but as I did background research for the book, I uncovered my own evidence that  shows a long history of weather tampering by the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy.  Now, this was a fiction book then that you were writing? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  And in your research, is the degree of the government tampering with the weather as much  as you first put it in the fiction?  Well, that's a good question.  In fact, they were further along than I had anticipated.  Of course, fiction, you can make everything you want, but when I went and looked at the  research and the technology they were using, it amazed me, first of all, how long they've  been playing around with this kind of science and what impact they've been having. 
[01:18:00]  See, it's a little different, though, if it's just, you know, some cloud seeding and, you  know, then you're trying to make...  No, no, it's far more advanced, although that is the early technology that back in...  Give you some history here.  The Eisenhower administration had a whole committee devoted to what they called weather control.  He was concerned that the Russians had already beat us to this kind of technology.  Goddamn commies.  Goddamn commies.  Then jumps in by 1960s during the Vietnam War, we launched a program called Project 
[01:18:30]  Popeye, where we were cloud seeding, exactly as you described, launching chemical weapons,  which they nicknamed as olive oil, into the atmosphere to basically take advantage of  existing storm systems and hopefully make it rain.  Right.  So how far have they gotten?  What are they doing?  What are they, machines?  Well, not really.  They still use...  You're familiar with chemtrails?  Yes.  They use chemtrails as chemicals they've loaded the afterburner of jets.  Yeah.  And so just a high-end form of cloud seeding where you're spraying these guys back and 
[01:19:00]  forth with enough of the chemical to either induce rain or suppress your storm systems.  Yeah.  Well, that doesn't sound very spectacular.  I want the big, you know, my weather machine.  With my weather machine, I'll rule the world.  You know, something like that in a big mountaintop.  Sir, have you heard anything about the...  I'm sorry, Ben.  Go ahead.  I want to...  Do you hear anything about the jet stream being lower and that causing certain weather  problems?  Have you heard anything about that? 
[01:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  I mean, yeah.  There's a lot of mention of...  I mean, I subscribe to the theory that global warming is a real deal, that it may be far  more advanced and far more serious than we've been told.  There are benevolent uses of weather modification.  If you can create enough cloud cover, you can alter jet streams, you can actually prevent  UV rays from, you know, hitting the planet.  All that is part of this, that while it could be the ultimate military weapon, let's say,  on a battlefield, long range, this is what their goal is, is to modify it on a grander 
[01:20:00]  scheme.  If you make it rain, it would probably be easier to find the enemy with their umbrellas  out.  But, Jim...  But, Jim?  Yeah.  Like, as I'm reading up on you, I'm thinking we're going to be hearing about some big conspiracy.  This just sounds like something that a lot of people kind of know is going on.  Well, I mean, not everyone does know what's going on, but here's the conspiracy of the  controversy that I see.  And for a while, a lot of people were kicking around the concept of, can they control the 
[01:20:30]  weather?  But for the longest time, people denied it.  Congress denied it.  But there is, there was a bill trying to be passed back in October called the Space  Preservation Act, which banned the use of what they call chemtrails and exotic weapons.  That bill was rewritten about six weeks ago, removing any references to chemtrails.  Well, fundamentally, people are suckers for the truth.  And the truth's on your side, Bubba.  Yeah.  It is.  Hey, are you calling us from an iron lung? 
[01:21:00]  No.  That dog don't, huh?  No, he's good.  You all right with your lungs?  Yeah, I'm cool.  You're missing one?  No.  Oh, you, you, I hear a lot of, after you speak.  Oh, no, no.  It must be just a connection.  Yeah, it could be the, uh, it could be the connection.  I was hoping for, uh, yeah, we thought that you had, like, machines.  No, I'm not in a hospital anywhere.  I'm, I'm in a normal office environment.  I thought maybe you'd be a kook or something.  Well, I could be that, but. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  We thought you had a little more for, uh, for us.  Yeah, it was, I just hate to disappoint guys.  Well, sometimes what happens is you got to go on, people go on blind faith that things  aren't being done.  I mean, because normally, like, how do you know who your daddy is?  Because your mama told you?  Exactly.  That's a, that's, that's a good point.  It's true.  I could have said it better myself.  Yeah.  We're just learning that, uh, we can make it rain when we want.  What about the evidence?  What evidence have you found?  Documents and stuff.  Well, there are a number of documents, um, one of which is called, uh, weather as a force 
[01:22:00]  multiplier, owning the weather by the year 2025, put out by the Air Force, that, that cites  a lot of the historical things that I mentioned.  Um, also the UN in 1977 had assigned a treaty, um, promising we would not use weather as a course  of weapon, but, uh, the tests still continue.  They are actively pursuing this kind of technology.  All right.  Can, can, uh.  I'm not convincing you guys, am I? 
[01:22:30]  Can kitty litter be used to soak up hurricanes?  Yes.  Why do you say yes?  Well, I'm just agreeing with you.  I think that would be a great concept.  Did you ever intern for a radio show?  No, that was, um, that was actually an article somewhere in a, in a paper.  Right.  Yeah.  Well, there are a number of patents out there put out, um, that can suppress rain, but  they use, uh, barium salt, polymer fibers, aluminum oxide, that kind of thing.  If you put your microwave oven out your window or door during a tornado, can you, with the  heat and microwaves, actually make the tornado go away? 
[01:23:00]  I haven't seen evidence of that, but that could work.  That could work.  Fascinating.  What would the major implications be of weather modification if they're really trying to  do it, or if they're succeeding in doing it, what are some of the major implications?  There has to be a reason.  Very good.  Good question.  Getting back on track.  Okay.  Uh, Jim, it's to you.  Yeah, it's, uh, the, the.  And this is where we play the silent game.  If you begin to play with this sort of, open a Pandora's box, if you can control weather  over, let's say, the U.S., who is downwind of it? 
[01:23:30]  And if you begin steering storm systems, the implication is, would you push a hurricane  towards another country, um, who is downwind, per se, of some of the ill weather you don't  want over your country?  That, that's really the controversy here.  Here it is.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:24:00]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you just, you just hung up.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that's how the silent game works.  Sometimes they sit there, hello, hello.  Jeez, dude.  All right, there you have it. 
[01:24:30]  The worst break of the show today.  Let's, uh, get back on track.  What?  Well, I thought he was weather conspiracy guy.  That's the way he was sold to me, is weather conspiracy guy.  Talking about military downloading of stuff.  Look at the, yeah, right.  Let me read this.  Right, right.  I just read this, too, when they sent it to me.  Eddie Osland is a small-town newspaper reporter who uncovers the story of his life.  After local farmers killed by lightning, Eddie begins reading a weather almanac the farmer left behind.  The weather forecast in the almanac proved to be more accurate than what is broadcast by meteorologists. 
[01:25:00]  How could the farmer be so accurate?  Eddie studied the notebook and realized the farmer had downloaded sensitive government data  that proves the global weather system is pre-programmed by the U.S. military.  This is the fiction book he put out.  He's a novelist.  I thought he was a kook.  Who believed that?  He had a few facts.  They probably do do some weather work, and then he wrote a book about it, and now he's  almost reversing it, like, look what I uncovered in research for my book. 
[01:25:30]  When it's just, as far as, if I could say this without offending people, it's a bunch  of bunk.  A bunch of bunk.  Hey, let's move on.  Jennifer's on the phone, and she's not very happy right now.  Oh, we got a really hot blonde outside.  She totally ignored me when I said hi, and she just looked at me.  And she's got a little cowboy hat on, and she wants in on the WOW Contest.  So Rick has just left the studio with his digital camera.  Hey, Jennifer, contestant number 35 in the WOW Contest, what's going on?  If you remember Jennifer, she had called with her boyfriend on the day her photos went up.  Yeah, Jennifer, I do believe the last time you called, we made fun of your teeth, really. 
[01:26:00]  No, Opie did.  Yeah.  So what's your problem today, Jennifer?  Well, I just went on there, and I saw that there was other girls, like, with dogs.  I mean, like, 12, 18, 20.  Come on, guys.  I mean, this is a...  I just figured out.  Jennifer was very upset that she was one of the 10 girls that had to be kicked out of  the contest to make room for hotter girls. 
[01:26:30]  Right, Jennifer?  Well, why do you have to kick us off?  I don't think it's right for you guys to even choose.  I think in this case, it's pretty obvious to us and everyone else out there.  So we figured, what the hey?  She's got a point with 18.  18?  Let's go to 18.  How did we miss her?  Let's go to 18.  No.  Hold on.  Let's go to 18.  Let's see if Jennifer has a point.  Go to three pictures down.  Go to three pictures down on 18.  Stop it.  She's absolutely right. 
[01:27:00]  Jennifer, I'd keep you in and throw her out.  No, it's a wow contest and this girl, although she's pretty hideous, she has fine can.  No, she doesn't.  Go third picture down.  Third picture down.  Look at those things.  The big dark things around.  I like them.  Yeah.  Nice.  Jennifer?  Yes?  You didn't think you were going to win the contest, did you?  I think I had a close chance.  I think you did, too.  Really?  Yeah.  I mean, last time I talked to you guys, Anthony said I was cute.  I thought so and I still do.  Let me see the picture.  Oh, I'm guessing Opie kicked me off. 
[01:27:30]  Opie kicked you off.  Me and Ant vote to keep you on.  Yeah.  Quite frankly, you're a dog.  It's not true.  Stop it.  She's not a dog.  At all.  Shit, nice cat.  Wait, Jennifer, you really thought you had a chance in this contest?  I thought I had a close chance.  I got a...  I mean, you guys didn't even give me a chance.  I got a doctor you should go see.  Dr. Philotov, Diamond Vision, 1-800-984-2020 for LASIK surgery.  No, Jen, I told you...  Or you might have cataracts.  I disagree with Opie on that one.  I think that you're...  Hold on.  Jennifer, you thought you had a close chance of winning this thing, right? 
[01:28:00]  Can you count to 20?  Yes.  All right.  I want you to be honest with yourself.  I want you to go to opandanthony.com and count, count to 20.  That meaning, count out 20 girls that you know are hotter than you and have better boobs than you.  Oh, I'm sure they're, you know, a little bit better looking than I am, but it's not a beauty contest.  You will barely get past the first set of pictures.  It's not a beauty contest, though.  You're absolutely right.  It's not.  I mean, so what about horse teeth and gums?  It's about, wow. 
[01:28:30]  Jennifer, stop.  Stop.  This is like the third time you've called us.  Stop.  No, it's the second time.  You're just making it worse on yourself.  It's so painful when Opie administers that dose of reality.  Stop.  That heaping helping of reality.  It's a counting thing.  You do dollop out a big helping of reality.  Dollop out this huge helping.  Hey, Jess.  Well, can I at least do reshoots or something?  Oh, boy.  I don't think that's...  Oh.  Hey.  Hmm.  A reshoot.  Unless we can take the pictures in a closet without a flash... 
[01:29:00]  Oh, shut the heck up.  A flash bulb.  You know, I think a reshoot, you never know.  Look at me with a flash bulb.  Look at that picture.  That's awful.  Let me see.  You are awful.  Dammit.  Oh, now the boyfriend's pissed.  What'd he say?  He said, it's a wow contest, goddammit.  He's right, technically.  It is a wow contest.  Exactly.  It's not a...  It's a wow contest.  We did keep girls in because it is a wow contest, though.  There were girls that we ran through and said, should she be thrown out?  And we said, no, because it is a wow contest. 
[01:29:30]  But...  There's one picture of you.  You look like you have man boobs.  I have what?  There's nothing feminist about...  Where's everyone going?  Why do I have to always do this alone?  Come back here.  Come on.  Jennifer.  Yeah.  Are you on the website right now?  No, I'm not.  I would love to see who you think you're hotter than.  Hello?  Who am I hotter than?  Yeah.  Boyfriend, just pick up the phone.  I'm not on right now.  Boyfriend.  Boyfriend. 
[01:30:00]  Hello?  Wait, hold on.  Jennifer, we had to make...  What are you doing?  I'm on the phone, too.  See?  I just wanted to hear what they were saying.  I think your girlfriend is beautiful.  I can't believe Anthony kicked her out of the couch.  No, it wasn't Opie.  Stop it.  You know it was Opie.  Yeah, we know it was Opie.  Hey, what's your name again?  What's that, Bob?  Bob.  Yeah.  Bob, you've been on opieandanthony.com, and you're checking out all the contestants, right?  Yeah.  You have to admit, right now, on our show, that there are 20 girls hotter than your chick. 
[01:30:30]  We're not...  It's not a hotness contest.  It's not a beauty contest.  It's a wow contest.  All right.  When I say hotter, meaning they have better wows.  They have better boos.  Well, there's probably not 20 girls on there that have perfect breasts.  Hold on.  No.  I mean, even the one...  Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.  Simple question.  Have you been on opieandthony.com?  Yes, sir.  You cannot even be honest with yourself and everyone else listening out there that you  can't find 20 girls that have better wows than your girlfriend, Jennifer? 
[01:31:00]  The one that you made the biggest deal about, Wendy June.  What number?  I don't even know.  You are trying to tell me that your girlfriend with the graveyard teeth is hotter than Wendy June?  Her breasts are better than Wendy June.  Yeah, those are so fake, and they're plastered on her neck.  I like this guy.  Shut up, Jim.  I like him.  Thank you, Jim.  I'll see you at the 27th in AC.  You're trying to tell me that chick, I'm looking at Wendy June, her boobs at least look feminine. 
[01:31:30]  Your girlfriend has man boobs.  She does not.  She looks like they're plastered on her neck.  Well, that's besides the point anyway, because I don't think you guys are being fair, because  you know half the girls anyway.  We don't know any of these girls.  You were just saying on a couple of shows, you knew one of the girls, or Jimmy said today  that he knew a couple of the girls, and I don't think you guys are being fair at all.  Don't blame me.  I didn't have you booted.  I didn't boot anybody out.  Jennifer.  We know it's all opie.  Yeah.  Jennifer, it's, you know, I'll say this. 
[01:32:00]  You're not the ugliest girl in the contest.  Jesus.  No.  That's good, right?  I know I'm not ugly, but you should at least give me a chance.  You can take that with you.  Not everybody makes $110 million.  Oh.  You can't afford the plastic surgery.  First of all, my girl, my point is I don't think you guys should take anybody off.  I think you should let your listeners vote for who they want to take off.  Wow.  We're looking at the latest contest in the WOW contest. 
[01:32:30]  Another girl that's hotter than Jennifer.  And her pictures will be up on opianthony.com very soon.  And we don't know this girl.  And it looks like she has natural boobs.  And I don't like her because she totally ignored me when I said hello.  That's all right.  Look at her.  She deserves to ignore you.  I've got to admit, the best boobs on there are all natural.  Any of the ones with the fake ones, most of them look hard.  Bob, I agree.  I hate the fake boobs, Bob.  I agree with you.  Bob, we did this contest last year.  It wasn't called the WOW contest.  It was called the best boob contest.  And the girl that won it, she beat out all the breast implants. 
[01:33:00]  Natural bees.  I remember.  So we'll have to see what happens when the voting starts.  Usually you guys blow off the boob job.  I think there's a misconception as to what this contest is about, too.  It's a WOW contest.  It is not necessarily a best boob contest.  It's not necessarily a hot chick contest.  It's the best WOW.  If you're topless and you are WOWing the people that are looking at the pictures.  You know what I mean?  The boobs are a big part of the contest, but it's also the whole package.  It's also WOW.  You might give them an extra point because they don't have graveyard teeth. 
[01:33:30]  You might give them extra points because their boobs don't look like a man's.  Take the best boob contest.  It's not about their face.  No, it's about the whole package.  Take the best boobs you've ever seen in your life and put them on Rosie O'Donnell.  All of a sudden, those boobs aren't going to be as good, even though they're the same boobs that were on a different body yesterday.  You know what I'm talking about?  It's the whole package. 
[01:34:00]  And don't get me wrong, Bob and Jennifer.  I think Jennifer's breasts are lovely.  And the whole package.  You're half a bag.  For some reason, Opie had a problem with her.  I've got to say that the pictures do not do her justice.  I don't know if we could have gotten it.  Okay, now you're admitting that there's some problems there.  Well, I'm saying you guys are saying they're not that good, but I'm telling you they are that good.  Bob, I'm thinking you could do a little better than Jennifer.  What's that? 
[01:34:30]  I don't know.  Could you reshoot?  No, there's going to be no reshoots.  Why can't I do a reshoot?  Because it ain't going to make a difference.  You guys aren't being fair at all.  There are 20 at least.  Oh, my God.  And this is me being nice.  There are at least 20 girls that are hotter than you, so you didn't have a chance anyway.  Oh, God.  I would say there are 60 to 70 girls hotter than you in this country.  Oh, my God.  There's only 85 girls.  It doesn't matter what your listeners think. 
[01:35:00]  You don't want to know what the listeners think.  I'm being nice by not going to the phones.  No, no, no, they don't.  Look at the screen.  The listeners might think differently, Opie.  I was against you.  You're not even giving your listeners a chance.  I agree with you.  Right.  Okay, here we go, Jennifer.  Here we go.  Anthony.  Hey, Mr. Jennifer, Ed, can I talk to you for a second?  Hey, listen, I'm having a six-year-old birthday party.  I want to have pony rides.  Can I rent you for the day?  Oh, boy.  All right. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, man.  And, you know, Anthony tricked me.  You said he thought Jennifer's boobs were nice.  She's disgusting.  She's horrible.  Get off the phone.  Your boyfriend's a douchebag.  I'll show you a douchebag.  Hey, Bob.  Hey, Bob, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  When you're giving it to your girl, man, do you look at those teeth when she's crushing  her teeth together and just grinding, looking up at you, Bob?  I won't acknowledge any a-holes, but, uh...  All right.  All right.  And while you shoot...  How about getting a couple people that are saying good stuff about it? 
[01:36:00]  Hey, as soon as I find one, I'll put them through.  Michael.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Listen, Jennifer, you know, as far as the contest is concerned, it's a wow contest, but I'm  telling you, if it was a beaver contest, you'd come in first.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on, Al.  That's just not necessary.  You don't need a reshoot.  You need a dentist.  You're a bastard.  The bottom line is, Jennifer, you're the patty of Philadelphia.  You're calling up three times, whining about it.  Give it up.  And you want acknowledgement for the O&A call?  They're going to ridicule you.  And why am I the bastard, Bob? 
[01:36:30]  You said to go on the phones.  We're going on the phones.  Here's a guy, Michael.  He's a faithfulist in the show.  He calls almost every day.  Put a good call through.  There's got to be a good call.  Yeah, put a good one through.  And then there's Norton.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Norton, you're a marshmallow, okay?  Yes.  Stop kissing your butt, pal.  Yeah, hey.  You want to sell tickets?  Relax.  Dude, I don't care about selling tickets to Red Bank on August 10th.  It means nothing to me.  All right, good.  You want to go to the Count Basie Theater?  That's your business.  All right.  But the bottom line is, when she's giving you all streets, you really have to trust her. 
[01:37:00]  You know what I mean?  All right.  Thank you, Michael.  I don't know what that means, Bob, but you wanted us to go to the phones.  Rich from Long Island writes, her smile makes Rich Voss look like a poster boy for Crest.  I don't know what that means.  Oh, stop now.  Come on.  You're going to be way too hard on him.  Come on.  All right, let me go to Jimmy.  It looks like he has something positive.  Yes, Jimmy?  Yo, poster girl for birth control.  I mean, come on.  No way.  Those people, like, she started grinding on something more than D.  She looked like she was grinding on something more like garbage.  All right?  I'd like to see pictures of somebody.  That's number one. 
[01:37:30]  Number two, I have seen, there are guys with better chests than hers.  She can't wow.  It's more like, where?  Why is it your girlfriend?  There is no wow.  Exactly.  Where's your girlfriend, Bob?  Yeah.  Answer the lady.  That hag that you're going home to every night.  Right.  That's right.  Yo, I'm going home to double D's every night, baby.  So, have you, buddy.  All right, Jimmy.  Well, okay.  Well, I think you guys had enough fun.  I'm really disappointed.  Hold on.  Let me go to Davida.  To even see how well she would do.  I did her a favor. 
[01:38:00]  Davida.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Jennifer.  Jennifer, I'd like to say, I think you really, really look pretty.  I think your face kind of looks like somebody poured sulfuric acid on it and wiped it off  with sandpaper.  Oh, jeez.  Your face looks like you had a makeover with a shovel.  You have a double bunt.  Your pictures are successful as a challenger mission.  I would rather listen to Andrea Yates' kids scream as their little heads go in the water  than look at that wildebeest water buffalo picture of yours.  What the hell?  You're horrible. 
[01:38:30]  Kill yourself.  Horrible.  All right, guys, I do believe that might have been a prank call, so I apologize for  that one.  That was not the real Davida.  Although it does look like you washed your face with a beehive, but it's...  Oh, stop it.  She does not.  I think she's cute.  You guys are being...  It's not a Marilyn Monroe look-alike kind of thing.  Right.  Hey, Johnny, what's up?  Marilyn Monroe.  Hey.  Tell this girl to stick her face in the toilet bowl.  I'd rather see Susan Warman naked in that contest than ugly skank whore.  Oh, stop. 
[01:39:00]  I would just say I want to see any of these guys with a girl confident enough in her body  to bring their girlfriends out.  Bravo.  Absolutely.  We're desperate for money for whatever reason.  Yes.  Exactly.  Some girls should realize they should just stay home.  Oh, boy.  That's all?  That's all I'm trying to say?  I'm sure she's a lovely person.  Roger Clemens should hit you in the head with a fastball.  Maybe it'll make you look better yet.  Oh, stop it.  I hung up on him, guys.  That was going too far. 
[01:39:30]  Clemens should hit with a fastball?  Come on.  Stop.  These people.  I don't get it.  Well, guys, I really can't find one person that wants to say something nice.  Oh, Jerry from Jersey says...  I think we've said as much as we can say.  Well, Jerry from Jersey said,  she's great, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot,  for a beer bottle opener.  What does that even mean?  Well, her teeth are so crooked that...  Oh, stop.  I'll tell you what. 
[01:40:00]  You guys said you're going to be down on the 27th in AC, right?  I will be.  No, not if you're going to be anywhere near that.  You guys see her in person,  because she'll be right up front,  and you tell me if you guys are wrong.  Why are you going to be in AC?  All right, I'll make sure I have a 12-pack.  Hey!  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Hey, hey, hey.  The whole thing is so different than them pictures.  All right, well, all right,  now you're admitting that the pictures aren't that great, right? 
[01:40:30]  Wait, that's why I want to reshoot.  Let's keep it this way.  You just don't take a good picture.  Well, I want to have a reshoot,  because we told you guys before,  the person who took my pictures was an idiot.  Jennifer.  No, he was an idiot.  Jennifer, I'm sure you're a lovely, lovely girl,  but you're awful as far as this contest goes.  Oh, boy.  What?  You're awful.  It ain't happening.  Whatever.  All right?  Whatever.  I'm just trying to let you down easy. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, boy.  Well, if you're going to take me off,  you better take off some other girls that I mentioned.  We're going to probably take another 10 off tomorrow.  Yeah.  That'll make you feel better?  See, you wouldn't have made it through the second cut.  No, it would make me feel better if you'd let me do another shoot.  Jennifer, you probably would have came in second to last.  This is better.  Whatever.  Now that we knocked 10 girls out,  now you're like, okay, maybe I was the one that just missed the cut.  I'll bet you 100 bucks, Opie,  she wouldn't have been in the, 
[01:41:30]  she would have been probably in at least the top 25.  In the contest?  Top 25?  He may be right.  With the reshoot, he may be right.  You don't know.  Maybe that was a bad shoot.  They're not all Rick.  No.  Stop smoking pot.  It's going to your brain.  You're going to get 100 girls.  If she's in the top 50,  No, because now what will happen if we keep the girl in there,  our ass-wipe listeners are going to all vote for her to make me look like a tool.  Exactly.  I wasn't born yesterday.  You are a tool. 
[01:42:00]  Exactly.  Michael Strahan called.  He wants his teeth back.  All right.  All right.  I got to go.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Then slam the phone down.  I can't take credit for that.  Keith Moon from Jersey.  Thank you.  Jennifer, contestant number 35.  There she is.  She's a little, um, she keeps calling.  She's doing it to herself.  I'm going to let you down easy. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, you said let her down easy.  What are you doing?  You shoot her for the beehive.  I want to let her down easy.  Hey, you guys remember yesterday we had Francine?  We're debating.  We might do part two of Francine's take.  Oh, yeah.  Not today because we actually prepared for today's show.  But, um, Steve, uh, from foundrymusic.com put a little something together called how to make a radio demo.  Um, quickly, though, a goo man said in the last picture of Jennifer, that fourth shot, she looks like she's holding in a fart. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, but she's got, like, the shot that they took, she's got, like, a linebacker.  Look, I am so glad a lot of our faithful listeners decided to, you know, get in on this contest and stuff.  Yeah.  But then you've got to be at home, by yourself, on the computer, on opianathlete.com, and you have to be really honest with yourself.  Yeah.  You think she's a little delusional is what it is?  Of course.  You look at all the girls and go, okay, well, I thought, all right, I had a shot at this.  But you know what?  Uh, all right. 
[01:43:30]  You know what I mean?  Alex from Westchester says, I have something good to say.  I honestly disagree with Opie.  I think he's a very good-looking man.  Hey, Chad from Philly writes, just like my dad used to say, can never polish a turd.  Dude, I think that with a reshoot, I mean, Philip Seymour Hoffman, you really don't know that.  What I'm trying to say is, the only thing that should be shot is Novocaine into her gums before the procedure. 
[01:44:00]  Like I always like to say, if you drive a crappy car, don't honk your horn.  Oh.  Oh.  All right?  All right.  Well.  Well, she's got some gumption.  I'll say.  You know?  Hey, she has a lot of, a lot of, uh, spunk.  Moxie.  She's got moxie.  She's got pizzazz, and you need that.  Yeah. 
[01:44:30]  Calling up and defending herself.  And her boyfriend defended her.  I like him.  He didn't run and hide under a couch.  Right.  I respect him.  Hey, Mario.  Hey.  Oh.  Yeah.  Bro.  What?  You gotta come down with these comments.  What?  Do you remember the first week where, where you, when you guys started the contest?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys were begging for girls to show up?  Yep.  Yep.  Okay.  Now you're, you're destroying everything you just did.  Now the girls forgot.  No, no, no, no, no.  I haven't ruined anything.  We don't have to beg anymore. 
[01:45:00]  We got a lot of hot girls in this contest.  Exactly.  And Vegas is going to give us 30 hot girls tomorrow.  A really hot blonde just got her pictures done.  She'll be up on opandanthony.com.  We're safe.  We're out of the woods.  Exactly.  What about next contest?  That's exactly it.  Next contest.  We're going to have to start from the bottom.  Next contest will be four to six months away from now, and all the girls will forget about  all the rudeness that we've thrown out.  Mario isn't the main.  Okay, Senor Speedy.  All right.  Thank you, Mario.  Martin, you rock.  Bye, Mario.  And thanks for milk. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  I don't like your attitude.  Bye.  All right.  How to make a radio demo.  Steve from foundrymusic.com.  And John, of course.  Oh, the credits are rolling.  And when we get back, we'll talk about, there was something.  Oh, the Michael Jackson thing?  Ah, Wacko Jacko.  Is a freak-o.  Right.  That was the post.  Awful.  I was just looking at the phones to see them.  There was one last.  One last.  Was there phones by my head? 
[01:46:00]  You got me twice today.  So, you want to be a radio star just like Opie and Anthony?  You're going to need a good demo tape.  It's not like the first tape you send to a radio show, all of a sudden you get a gig.  Oh, wait.  That's how I got mine.  Here's a few tips to make your demo a winner.  Get a good mic level.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  Ah!  Good.  Now keep the conversation light and airy.  I can never figure out why people smoke.  I mean, there's, like, birth defects and smelliness and holes in your clothes and, like,  burn down your house and stuff and all that cancer. 
[01:46:30]  Okay.  Make sure to relate to your audience.  I'm not going to get fat.  Not after the first kill.  Then you want to divorce me and go for the next war.  Of course.  Right.  Well, remember to keep it clean and radio friendly.  I really don't care about a lot of shit.  That's right.  Clean and radio friendly.  I have a high metabolism.  I'm burning that shit up as I eat it.  Just follow these simple steps and program directors nationwide will be overwhelmed by  your skin.  You should say the darndest things. 
[01:47:00]  You make no money and she'll be sucking D on 42nd Street.  Yeah.  Boy, does that sound like getting shot twice.  That's Cosby called you?  You're, like, on the edge there.  You're a blue.  Yeah.  Acting lesson.  Comedy lesson.  I envy that, Ted Willis.  Hyogenically frozen.  Yeah.  Eardrum's just completely frozen solid.  Not a vibration of sound gets through.  Yeah.  Sometimes death is a good thing.  Oh, mother of a son of a bitch.  Another lesson in Radio 101 by your pals at the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, we got a bunch of pissed off girls calling the Opie and Anthony Show right now. 
[01:47:30]  We give someone a taste of reality and there's people out there that don't like it, Anthony.  Right.  We kicked contestant number 35 out of the contest.  I think it was the right thing to do.  We kicked out 10 girls today.  10 girls just got the booth.  And it's not any of the girls.  It wasn't surprises.  There was no surprises here.  These are the girls that a lot of the guys checking out the website and the girls were  getting a little annoyed they were even in the contest. 
[01:48:00]  Our listeners have been emailing every day.  Every day.  So, Jessica.  Yeah?  What's wrong, Jessica?  Nothing.  I just felt really, really bad for that girl, Jennifer.  They were totally ragging on her.  Well, you know what?  She's called two or three times now.  She's got to realize, stop.  Stop.  First of all, she's not the greatest looking girl in the world.  You know what?  I haven't seen her picture.  How do I see it?  You go to opieandanthony.com. 
[01:48:30]  Hello?  How do I spell Opie?  H-I-T-L-E-R.  What do you think?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  All right.  Hold on one second.  Just because Opie cracked open that huge 55-gallon drum of reality and kicked it over, and it  spilt all over her.  Ha, ha, ha.  Uh, Jessica, the girl, um, she, she, uh, she was a dog.  She had really crooked teeth.  And we were trying to be nice, but then she was stupid enough to call the show. 
[01:49:00]  What, what did she expect?  I know, but you guys are so mean.  All those people were calling in and making fun of her.  If I were her, I would have gone and killed myself.  Well, those are the guys that, uh.  We felt like we could go to.  Yeah.  Those are the ones we didn't go to.  Yeah, I can just imagine.  No, I mean, you know, she, she didn't make the cut.  What can I tell you?  Yeah, but they, they just wanted to call up and read her the riot act.  What?  Someone's suggesting they should, uh, do a reshoot, but she shouldn't put in those teeth  she got at the five and ten.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:49:30]  You guys are cruel.  That poor girl.  Remember those teeth you used to lie and you'd smile and go, whoa.  You know what?  And I want Bob to call back up, uh, Jessica's, uh, boyfriend, contestant, uh, no, uh, Jennifer's,  uh, boyfriend, contestant number 35.  Yeah, he was getting pretty pissed.  Now, trust me.  We've talked to the guy two times, right?  Yeah.  Maybe three.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  He hasn't said anything about his physical appearance?  Right.  I will guarantee you.  I'm going to use some of my Kreskin powers here.  Whoa, are you going to fly against the wall? 
[01:50:00]  I don't want to ask this fly off.  I will guarantee you that this guy is a fatso.  You think?  I will guarantee that he's at least...  Yeah.  At least...  See, it's tough, because if he's tall, then it doesn't...  He's considered fat.  He's a fatso?  He's a fatso.  You fatso.  You think she's the kind of girl that would attract, uh, a fatso?  A fat guy?  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but... 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, I think that they should have him send in his picture so we can see what he looks like,  but I still feel bad for her, I mean...  Who knows?  But then again, he wasn't criticizing anyone's appearance.  I don't think he should have to send his pictures in.  Right.  He wasn't being very horribly mean.  Yeah, well...  Shh.  I don't know.  Shh.  Poor people.  How many people have their, uh, pictures up there?  Shh. 
[01:51:00]  Shh.  What?  Shh.  Shh.  Shh.  Thank you, Jessica.  Yeah, thank you.  Ladies, girl, uh, the latest girl on the WOW Contest is up on opiumanthed.com.  Wait, already?  Cowgirl is up.  The blonde cowgirl.  No way.  That was quick.  Beautiful.  Boy, some girls get up there a lot quicker, don't they?  Than others.  Yeah.  Hey, Jennifer.  Yeah.  Uh, are you a different...  You're a different Jennifer? 
[01:51:30]  I'm sorry?  You're a different Jennifer?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, no, I just had a Jennifer on.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yes, I'm a different Jennifer, not number 35.  Okay.  Go.  What do you want?  Um, I just had to call and say that that was just really horrible, what you guys were saying.  Not you guys.  Uh, Oopie and Anthony and the douchebags that called in?  No, no.  Jennifer.  I mean, that's horrible.  Thanks.  Don't you understand if you don't want to, uh, hear what someone has to say, you don't 
[01:52:00]  ask them?  Yep.  Right?  What do you mean?  If she would have just kept her mouth shut and, and, and taken it like a, like a man she  is, she, uh, it wouldn't have been as bad.  Yeah.  What do you look like?  Shut your face.  I'm, I'm, I'm all right.  You're all right?  Yeah.  I wouldn't be entering, uh, some hot hunk contest.  Right.  But I'm all right.  But if, if there was a radio station out there having a hot hunk contest.  Hot hunk?  Where I had to get, where I had to take my shirt off and get some pictures taken. 
[01:52:30]  You know what?  Some beefcake shots.  You know what, Jennifer?  I would not be going down to that station.  Right.  Right.  There it is.  You got to live, uh, within your limits and realize what you're all about.  That's true.  Well, I have some, yeah, I understand.  I, I just had to call on Defender.  I mean, I, I just thought that was horrible.  That's all.  I'd do all right for myself, but if there was some kind of hot hunk contest, I'm not joining.  Although you, of all of us, I don't know who's, you, I think have, you definitely have a better body than me.  Uh, and Ben.  Boy, that's hard. 
[01:53:00]  I can't see Ant.  I really, I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.  I don't know what Ant's body looks like.  I imagine it's better than mine as well.  Imagine.  Look.  I can't see.  You don't need the clothes off to figure that one out.  Jeez, man.  Man, well, Bobby's my brother-in-law.  Oh.  So just to let you know, he's not fat and he's rather very attractive.  Oh.  Just to let you know.  All right.  I just had to call and defend her because I just felt that that was totally wrong because she's a very beautiful person inside. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  Jennifer, say hi to your brother-in-law, Jack Black, for us.  Okay?  Thank you.  I don't like the beautiful inside remark either.  We're not doing an inside contest.  If it's an autopsy competition, then you enter that.  I thought she was fine for the contest.  Oh, boy.  Bob's calling back.  I like Bob.  Bob?  Yeah.  Bob, how you doing, man?  All right.  You're not fat?  First off, I'm 6'2", 205 pounds.  What are you doing?  What are you doing tonight?  Seriously, how big are you down there? 
[01:54:00]  I don't know.  Last time, I don't know.  Big enough for you, Norton.  I'll say.  Hi, Bob.  I doubt that.  So, Bob, you're not fat?  No.  You know what?  I'm 33 years old, and I've got a 20-year-old girlfriend.  How's that?  Nice.  Yeah, all right.  Sometimes that can be a nice thing.  And that was my sister-in-law on the phone.  Thank you, Jen, for defending Jennifer.  All right.  You guys are very close.  I like that.  Yeah.  Bob, what part of Jennifer are you attracted to?  You know what?  The first time she took off her shirt, I said, those are absolutely perfect breasts, and 
[01:54:30]  that is no lie.  Yeah.  And she's just the nicest person.  She's got a pretty face.  She's got a great body.  And I'm telling you, guys, you blew it with this one.  The intern that took those pictures, horrible pictures of her.  Was the guide dog in the room at the time?  The guide dog?  Yeah, yeah, he was.  Jeez.  All right, Bob.  We're just telling you the truth.  All right.  I say we put her back in the contest. 
[01:55:00]  I do.  No.  You know what?  She was going to go down for a reshoot yesterday, and we got busy.  I say she's back in.  No.  The listeners have suffered enough.  I have to put my foot down.  No.  How about a reshoot, Opie?  A reshoot.  I'll tell you what, Opie.  How about a little contest between me and you, and if I win, you put her back in?  What kind of contest is that?  You name it.  What do you want to do?  Push-ups?  What do you want to do?  Hey.  Do you want to do a little foot race?  All right there, tough guy.  Yeah, tough guy.  Yeah.  What do you want to do?  I say that you guys have a competition, and whoever's got a little word counts. 
[01:55:30]  How about we...  First of all, you pick two things I'd kick your ass in.  How about we get a couple fluffers, and we whip them out and see who's got a little bit  bigger package.  How about that?  I'll fluff.  I'll fluff.  No fluff.  What are you packing?  Put your money where your mouth is.  What are you packing?  Two fistfuls and about an inch.  You win.  Two fistfuls?  Are those boss fists?  Yeah.  No, not rigid fists. 
[01:56:00]  Wait, you could put two fists?  Two fists around it, and there's still some sticking out the end.  Wait a minute.  Let me...  All right, hold on.  Don, why do you have to test this?  You've been whacking your bag for 30 years.  You're not pushing down on any area.  No, no pushing or nothing.  Wow.  You don't have two fistfuls.  That's a nice one.  I know.  I was hoping.  You probably have two fists.  I'd say you have one fat, delicious fistful, but I don't think you have two.  That's all right.  I just want to know now.  Let me see.  Two fistfuls.  Let me work this out. 
[01:56:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm working it out.  I'd say you're about seven and a quarter to seven and a half.  I'd take them on on that.  Hold on.  I would take them on on that.  Hold on.  What's that, bro?  I'm working it out because I know how far up it goes.  But then again, this dude is six.  Don't forget.  Well, this dude's six, too.  He's got big hands.  Dude, I will so take you on on the two fist thing.  Let's do it.  Two fists and then a helmet out the top.  Helmet out the top.  I got that with my hands.  Yeah, but you got little peewee hands.  Look at you.  You're, what are you, 5'10"?  5'9"?  Wow, yeah.  That 5'10 is a short person. 
[01:57:00]  You got little tiny hands.  I'm about six foot, actually.  I got meat hooks.  Huh?  I got meat hooks for hands.  Girls got them for teeth.  All right, Anthony.  I heard that.  That wasn't me.  It was, Anthony.  Dude, I think he's got you beat on the hill.  How many layers has she gnawed away so far?  Yeah, maybe it's not that big.  Maybe it's just swollen.  All right.  Get out of here, you wacky kids.  All right, guys.  Later.  Later, Bob.  All is good, all right? 
[01:57:30]  He's got, you know something?  God bless him.  He's got a girl there that he loves and feels that she is beautiful, and can't we all just  appreciate that?  There you go.  All right.  God, I can't stop thinking about that contest between him and Oates.  Is that going to pop in your head next time you're being dumped on or something?  Two fists, really, Greg?  Two fists with some despair.  I'd say.  It's like when you do that thing and you throw the bat in Little League and all go up 
[01:58:00]  the handle, and then whoever cups the top wins.  Whoever grabs the top gets to go.  Cindy.  Yes.  What's up?  Hi.  Listen, I feel you guys need to get some more good-looking girls in there.  Whoa.  I think some of these girls shouldn't show their faces.  They're going to be in the competition.  Where's your accent from?  Shawshank?  What?  Where are you from, Cindy?  Hi, Boston.  Yeah.  I didn't hear the Boston accent in there. 
[01:58:30]  Got the accent going.  How did you not?  All right.  What, you think you could do better than a lot of the girls?  Yeah.  I mean, some of the girls are cute.  I'll admit that.  But a lot of the girls, I just, I feel as though they shouldn't show their face.  They just, I mean, unfortunately, I mean, the contest, yeah, for the boobs, but they're  not going to win because people are going to see the face.  It's not a best boob, though.  It's a wow contest.  Take somebody like, I'm just popping right up here.  Number 93, Stacy from Philly.  Beautiful.  Very cute girl. 
[01:59:00]  Beautiful.  Beautiful chest.  Beautiful face.  And the whole package is good.  She's got a nice wow going on there.  She does a little ass shot.  I will defend the girls in this contest.  We got a lot of lookers.  We got a lot of good ones now.  Lookers.  Yeah.  Hubba hubba.  1945.  Why don't you enter?  I'd say she's a real dish.  23 Skadoo.  Look at the pins on her.  My set of stems.  Why don't you enter?  Why don't you enter?  Thank you, Cindy.  Cindy?  Yeah.  Go down and get your picture took. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, right.  The boyfriend would kill me.  All right.  Maybe they'd take you down there.  All right.  Oh, Joe from Bayside says, does Jennifer know about Bob's 20-year-old girlfriend?  Yeah, who else was surprised that she was 20?  Oh, now you're saying that she didn't look 20 either?  Oh, you're very mean-spirited.  Yes, I am.  That's very hurtful.  Yes, it is. 
[02:00:00]  That big, heaping, steaming, spoonful of reality.  Hey, is that chick going to enter the contest?  No.  Just tell her to go home.  Oh, Jesus.  No, now, see, you've got to at least get the pictures taken.  Perhaps they're more photogenic.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I saw some girl walk by.  Oh, no, she's got a nice rack.  Oh, yeah?  All right.  I don't like the meanness here on the Two Fistfuls and Anthony Show.  Two Fistfuls.  Do it to yourself, bro. 
[02:00:30]  I mean, you start from the...  Every day.  Yeah.  That's what Jimmy's motto is.  You start from, you know, and then you know where it goes on your thing.  Of course I do.  Dude, it's easy.  No problem.  I can get to it.  All depends on the hands.  Look.  I don't have the...  Definitely.  Yeah.  Here's why I don't like Ian, because I know he's packing, because he's not like...  For me to do that, I'm like, definitely.  And I'm mushing my right pinky under my left thumb.  I'm like, chipped cheek.  He's got like both hands.  Doing the golf grip on the hands. 
[02:01:00]  Interlocking the fingers.  You're holding like Ty Cobb.  Let me choke up on this thing.  He's holding his bat like...  Oh.  Oh, you stink.  That guy sucks.  I had a great reference, too.  Uh-huh.  Felix Mion.  Oh.  But I blew it.  All right.  Wacko Jacko Freako thing next.  This is going to be very carefully.  Whip-em-out Wednesday.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:01:30]  Start spreading the news.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  And we got three more girls outside the studio that want their pictures done for the WOW Contest.  This contest taking on a life of its own.  They always start slow.  Vegas better not let us down tomorrow.  They said they got 30 girls stopping by tomorrow to get their pictures taken. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  30 girls from Vegas.  Third.  It's hilarious.  The phones have exploded, Anthony.  All the guys out there trying the two-fist thing.  They are?  Yeah.  That's two-fist and then a little extra.  Something's got to be, yeah, poking out the top with the remainder.  All right.  We should get into the Michael Jackson thing, huh? 
[02:02:30]  Wacko Jacko.  Oh, wait a minute.  I got to stop the music for a second.  What?  What the?  Uh, Rick?  There's three girls out there.  They need their pictures taken.  What are you doing?  You're eating a yogurt.  Yeah.  You got a job to do.  You're usually very excited to leave the studio and get the pictures done.  You know what?  Usually.  He's very testy.  When that hot blonde with the cowboy hat came walking down the hall, I mean, you left like  a cartoon character.  Yeah. 
[02:03:00]  We saw the smoke and we heard, and the little twinkle toes like, yeah, and then there was  a rick-shaped hole in the wall where you ran right through it, a little camera.  And right now you're not moving.  What's the problem?  Well, I sense it.  Well, problem, Rick?  Problem?  Well, there's one girl that, you know, came down for a reshoot.  Oh, okay.  Rick gets very insulted when the girls come back down for a reshoot.  Oh, because they had...  I didn't even think about this.  They're insulting his work.  That's right.  It's not that I feel insulted. 
[02:03:30]  I feel it's a waste of my time.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That can only mean one thing.  If you don't feel...  If you feel it's a waste of your time for a reshoot, then you feel there is no hope.  There is absolutely no hope.  You have gotten the best photos of her that can possibly be...  Oh, yeah.  I made her look great.  There's nothing more I can do to help this girl.  All right.  You better bring her in.  Could you tell me the number? 
[02:04:00]  Look, man.  I'm out of this one.  Give me the number, Rick.  I'm out of this one.  Just hold up fingers.  I'm looking at the page.  All right.  We're going to go to opanthony.com, and we're looking at contestant number 90.  Oh, I've got to go way down there.  Okay.  You know what?  I agree with Rick.  Those are some fine pictures.  Oh, boy.  No jokes.  Those are some good pictures.  Rick did his job there.  I did the best I could.  What's her name again? 
[02:04:30]  Swiss Miss.  Here, get Swiss Miss.  Considering what I had to work with...  Swiss Miss.  Yes.  Hi.  You've insulted Rick.  I have...  Mr. Rick is insulted.  I'm not insulted.  I was very polite.  I'm not insulted, but there's not much I can do for you.  There's nothing else you can do.  No.  What?  There's another picture.  There was another picture.  Swiss Miss, what's wrong with your pictures?  I think they're lovely.  No, they're not lovely.  She's in them.  She's in them.  Oh, Jesus, Rick.  No, it's...  The first one just doesn't... 
[02:05:00]  I don't know.  It just doesn't...  It doesn't look right.  It's not...  The first one.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think I'm agreeing.  What?  What's wrong with the first one?  I don't like it.  But that's the way you look.  No, but the others, I feel, look a little bit better.  Okay.  I like which...  So why don't we just take picture one out and you're looking good?  Yeah.  That's all I wanted.  So then you don't have to get naked for that.  That's fine.  All right.  That's all I came here for.  Oh.  You could have just, you know... 
[02:05:30]  That's what I said on the phone.  Left a message.  I did leave a message.  Rick is very insulted.  I like the way the shadow...  I really wish you wouldn't be insulted.  I thought I was very polite when I said that.  Well, you weren't polite.  You were extremely rude yesterday, which...  I was so not rude.  No, no, no.  You were rude.  You were mouthing off.  And the last thing I want to hear from anybody in here who is a guest is crap, which makes you  that much more unattractive.  If I said anything yesterday to offend you, I apologize, but I don't... 
[02:06:00]  Wait, wait, hey.  Oh, sorry.  I went the wrong way.  Right.  With that language.  Language, Rick.  She was being an a-hole.  What was it that I said?  Which definitely detracts from whatever beauty you think you might have.  What was it that I said that offended you?  No, you were just obnoxious and rude.  Why?  Anytime I went to move you into position, oh, oh, here, oh, oh, what are you taking a break?  Maybe she was a little nervous to be naked or whatever.  No, no, it wasn't nervous.  No, I wasn't nervous.  It wasn't nervous. 
[02:06:30]  She was just being an ass.  I was just being an ass.  So there was no chemistry between the photographer and the subject.  No, and the subject.  Sometimes that happens.  You know, I don't like picture three.  Because, Rick, you should have seen this.  There's a shadow on the wall that makes her front look like it's sticking out further.  Take a look at this.  See the shadow?  See the shadow on the wall behind her? 
[02:07:00]  It makes it look like her belly is sticking out further than it really does.  Well, no, it really does stick out like that.  Oh, Jesus.  No, that's definitely the shadow.  Oh, God, Rick.  Well, should we reshoot her?  Was it that you just didn't like the subject, Rick, and you decided to take some crappy pictures?  No, this is all I had to work with.  Take a look.  I'm going to have to say that she needs a reshoot.  Well, no, I don't even need a reshoot.  I think the photographer and the subject should try to get along. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, and let's give it another go around.  No.  You know, it's just the first picture that I'm not really happy with.  All right, we'll get rid of the first picture.  Because you showed me a couple yesterday while you were taking them, and they looked good.  But these were the best ones.  The first one I don't like.  I mean, I know it's ultimately up to you, but the first one I'm not happy with.  It's not up to me, actually.  It's not up to you.  Is that a trademark shot, Rick, the first one?  The first one, many of the girls are using that as the opening shot.  Yeah.  Let's face it, they're exposing themselves for the first time on it. 
[02:08:00]  So it's like you leave their shirt on, and you have them pull the front down.  Like, take a look at number 99.  She's doing the exact same thing.  Oh, no.  Actually, we didn't use that shot.  Oh.  Because she blinked.  But most of the other girls that I've shot do the exact same open, you know, the first.  You used it on 92, unfortunately.  Right.  See, that's another problem.  Should Swiss Miss just take a couple more shots, maybe?  I'm thinking another couple of shots. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah, I'm thinking a couple.  Yeah.  A couple more shots.  Yeah.  Just to make sure we got it right.  Are you up for that, Swiss Miss?  Yeah, I'm up for it.  I mean, if that's fine with Rick, I mean, I wouldn't want to...  Yeah, I think Rick will be very fine with that.  You know what?  I think I'm going to...  John's been wanting to take some pictures for a while.  He's been watching.  So I thought maybe this might be a good first test for him.  Now, if John takes better pictures of her than you did, he's going to, you know, say a little something.  He's going to say maybe you, you know, had to say you were holding something against her. 
[02:09:00]  No.  You weren't taking the...  No?  Rick, what's the problem with Swiss Miss?  I just don't like her attitude.  Jeez.  I mean, aside from the pictures, because that's just the way you look, there's nothing you can do about that.  You know, it would cost money, but you could have some things change.  But, you know, your attitude sucked, but, you know...  What's wrong with her body?  I like her body.  Yeah.  Well, take your shirt off, let me say.  Oh, boy. 
[02:09:30]  Look at that.  What is your shirt?  Just the top.  Wow, she's getting pissed off.  Why are you getting mad?  No, no, no.  I'm not pissed off at all.  No, there's really...  I'm just...  You know what?  There's not really much...  Some people are more photogenic than others.  No, no way.  And I'm just saying...  Those are very nice, natural boobs.  Right.  You know what?  I think she needs more pictures taken.  Right.  No joking here.  What happened in your pictures?  They look flat in the pictures.  Dude.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on.  No, I'm serious.  They look.  All right.  They're flat. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  Don't take that angle, then.  They're not flat.  They're natural.  But there's not much you can do with that.  I think it...  I can't work miracles.  I think they're nice.  I'm not...  It's just...  You showed me while you were taking pictures.  I know I showed...  Whatever I showed you.  But that's the way you look.  I can't help that.  A little catty.  That's...  When you were taking pictures, you showed me a few of them as you were taking them.  And there were some that looked really, really good.  Right.  But you know what?  Probably when they opened them up and took a look at them, maybe you would blink to them  or your head kind of looked weird. 
[02:10:30]  So they didn't want to use it.  We disregard a lot of shots.  That's why I take somebody.  Okay.  I think she would do well with the pushing them together pose that you use on some of  the girls.  Ooh.  Or the, you know, you put your arms like this pose.  No, like under and lift.  Yeah.  Are you looking at...  No, see, that doesn't work.  All right.  Well, you guys go outside the studio and take a few more pictures.  Yeah.  She came down for a reshoot, Rick. 
[02:11:00]  Well, it's a waste of trouble.  I did not mean to offend at all.  No, you didn't offend me.  I'm just saying there's nothing I can do for you.  You showed me other pictures, though, that I was satisfied with.  Okay.  Well, those are pictures of other girls.  I don't know what you're doing.  The girl's treated like a princess on Ron and Fez.  And look at what you're doing.  That's fine.  I can take it.  Well, I think that could be part of her problem.  She has an attitude that she owns this place and kind of pramps around here like, you  know, sitting on everything and talking out loud and blah, blah, blah. 
[02:11:30]  I thought they sit.  God forbid someone thought they sit.  No, no, no.  You know what I mean?  The radio station.  You know, sitting there, hey, somebody get me a beer, that kind of thing.  You know, this is not your house.  She sat and talked.  She sat.  Sitting, talking, bitch.  She sat and talked and took one of our free beers.  Used the facilities.  Damn.  She's breathing our air.  You know, there's limited supply in here.  Well, there is.  All right.  You know what?  We've got to take a quick break to catch up a little bit. 
[02:12:00]  I mean, a really quick break, okay?  And then we'll do some more radio for you.  Ben, we need commercials.  See, you know, Ben walking around here like he owns a place, not putting commercials in.  See, this is what happens when there's nothing in the machine.  I push this.  Big delicious bulge.  All right.  Two fists.  You know it.  Oh, yeah.  That's wide.  This young lady is flashing her privates.  Whip them out Wednesday with Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  A bunch of girls flashing their boobs, which is cool.  Wow!  As we continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, Michael Jackson's in the news.  Really?  Yeah.  I hadn't even noticed.  Three hours too late, but he's in the news, Anthony.  Wacko Jacko, as they call him in the paper.  Front page of the Post, I'm no freak.  Yes, you are.  Jackson lashes out at race and sex charges, Anthony. 
[02:13:00]  When you lash out at your album, Stunk, Sony dumped so much money into that disaster of the last album.  Lost millions upon millions of dollars.  Dropped bands.  They had to drop bands just because his album tanked.  He cost people their jobs because his album sucked.  And then he's going to turn around and accuse Tommy Mottola of being a racist and bash Sony. 
[02:13:30]  And now he's pulling out this race car.  All of a sudden, he's a proud black man with Al Sharpton holding rallies.  And he's the guy that went under the knife to have every black feature he ever had removed from his body.  And he doesn't even have the decency to molest black kids.  They're all white.  They're all little white kids.  Little white, tussleable hair kids.  He don't like nappy-headed.  He don't like it.  Wears red lipstick.  There's a proud black man wearing red lipstick. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, he is wearing lipstick on the cover of the pulse.  With your thin lips.  Thin lips.  Like a white woman.  And red lipstick.  Real proud black man.  Yeah, now all of a sudden he's pulling out how he's black.  A part of the article, he says,  I know I'm black.  I just have to look in the mirror and see what I am.  A freak.  You're a freak.  Look in the mirror.  You're a white lady.  Yeah, he's a white broad now.  Stupid hair.  Why does he...  You know, I'm so tired of the public coddling this... 
[02:14:30]  Enough with him.  He gets...  It was 85 degrees and this faggot is carrying an umbrella.  Stop it.  What, are you afraid the sun's gonna hit you, you bleachy zero?  Little, little, little dimple put in his chin.  Little dimple.  Perish the thought.  He gets some sun and he starts browning that skin of his.  Oh, my God.  But he might be mistaken for a black man that he's so proud to be.  What a disgrace.  Because he's made a lot of money.  Yeah.  I'm hated because I outsold Elvis.  No, at least Elvis had the decency to do dope and take dumps. 
[02:15:00]  You bang kids.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  Well, for an allegation.  Allegedly.  He sure paid a lot of money.  Sure.  For a mere allegation.  Boy, wouldn't you have spent that money on lawyers to clear your name?  Yep.  Wouldn't you have spent somewhere between $15 or $25 million, the settlement was, he gave  to the parents of that child that alleged that he molested him?  And wouldn't you have spent about average, let's say, $20 million on the best lawyers, 
[02:15:30]  the best investigators, to just completely crush any rumor that you're a kid toucher?  To clear your name?  But the fact of the matter is, they would have turned up facts, probably, in my humble,  in this reporter's humble opinion.  You could say this, you leave a little doubt there.  Right.  You leave, you know, people thinking, well, there might have been something to those charges.  If you're not touching children, you sure as hell would want the public, if they think 
[02:16:00]  you are, and you aren't, and you know you never did, to clear your name.  But this guy paid a huge sum of money to these scum parents that pretty much prostituted out  their kid, very expensive prostitute, but pimped out their child to this guy.  And people still, still bring their kids to that Neverland Ranch, where God only knows  what horrific things this freak, this freak is doing to those children. 
[02:16:30]  It's a desperate move.  Like you said, the album stunk.  We all got an advanced copy of the thing.  It was the joke of the industry.  Right.  Look at what he's putting out there for the public.  He's not that.  And now it's a desperate move.  And you know what's sad because of all this publicity he's getting?  Yeah, the album sales are going to go up a little bit for the guy.  A little bit.  And this is why Sharpton will never be taken seriously as a black leader because you actually  took this case and went, all right, yeah, we'll go.  Let's run with it. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, we got to get some of these quotes on the air.  He got lots of money.  He can buy pizza.  You want to hear the Reverend Al quote about this whole thing?  Yeah, let's hear Reverend Al.  The music industry is like the Rocky Mountains.  The higher up you get, the whiter it gets.  Hey, right, hey.  What?  Oh, my God.  Meaning there's no black existence.  The higher up you get, the whiter you get.  Like, how long did it take me to come up with that line? 
[02:17:30]  Let me see.  The music industry like Malamar.  The deeper into it you get, the whiter and fluffier the marshmallow filling.  But the outside's chocolate.  Wait, no, that don't work.  All right.  The music industry like Tootsie Roll dipping Cool Whip on one side and laid up on the tip.  And then the higher.  No, that's stupid.  Try like Oreo cookies.  Oreo cookie.  Because when you unscrew the top, you get the creamish center and you eat the cookie,  which the black man and the record industry eating up the cookie, which is the black man, 
[02:18:00]  only leaving the best part for last, which is the cream of the white man.  Try South Africa.  The music industry like a white woman.  The deeper you get, the pink it is.  Wait, no.  All right.  It looks like a wallet.  The music industry.  Hmm.  This is hard to come up with a clever one.  The music industry like Pave Road.  The higher up you get, you get run over because you're in the street. 
[02:18:30]  No, that don't work neither.  I suck.  I got nothing.  How about the music industry is like Michael Jackson?  It used to be black.  Now it's white with red lipstick and a thin nose.  Real proud to be black.  That's a good one.  Oh, wait a minute.  I can't use that one because I'm here with Michael.  Michelle Jackson.  Sorry, Miss Jackson.  Woo.  I'm hungry.  We got some more quotes.  I am outraged. 
[02:19:00]  We got that other quote.  The music industry like my wife.  White.  She's pretty light.  The music industry like Sidney Ponte's family.  White.  Which clip is this?  All right.  We got another Sharpton clip.  It's like a baseball player having to buy the bat, the ball and the mitt and rent the stadium to go play baseball.  No one has to pay for their right to work in America.  But why do artists have to pay?  Because the numbers are big. 
[02:19:30]  It's ridiculous.  See, this man is out of his mind.  He knows nothing of what he speaks about.  He's talking about the record industry being like baseball.  And why should, like the artist has to pay for the album to be made?  They got to recoup that cost.  And sometimes the artists, especially the first album, they get squat.  Even if it's a huge hit, they get nothing because the record company, and believe me, I'm not a fan of the record company, but if it wasn't this way, they'd go broke.  They get 100 artists.  One artist might make money for the record company. 
[02:20:00]  The other 99 are a cost to the record company.  And if they don't recoup, they're screwed.  They will not go on.  And once you get to the Michael Jackson part of your career, then you're making a lot of money.  He should keep his mouth shut.  If he didn't have to spend $20 million paying money to children's parents, perhaps he'd be in better shape.  And all this happens to white artists as well as black artists.  Of course. 
[02:20:30]  Do you know Skid Row made nothing?  How much did that album, that first one that they put out?  It made so much money.  They made nothing.  They were driving around in crap cars getting a per diem that was unbelievably low.  But it's the record company.  They've got to make money.  Here's the difference in baseball.  The Yankees never put out an album with one good song and 15 bad ones.  They've been putting out crap.  Two good songs and crap.  I love ceiling music.  You know what it is, too? 
[02:21:00]  He's talking about professional baseball players.  When you're coming up in the minors and stuff, you are buying a lot of your own stuff.  It's called making your bones in the business.  The guy's delusional.  He will jump on anyone's cause if he thinks it's going to get him in the paper or if it's some black-white issue.  It's like a hostess cupcake to the Reagan industry.  It's got chocolate icing on the outside, creamy filling.  Oh, I can't even talk about this. 
[02:21:30]  Get me to a bodega.  I've got to pick one of them up.  I'm like a double-stuff Oreo cookie.  I'm big and fat.  But he's saying that nobody has to pay to work.  Independent filmmakers do it all the time.  They get financing.  They pay for it.  And if they can't sell it to a studio, they take the loss.  Right.  Stupid.  He doesn't know what he's talking about.  He just hears Michael Jackson screaming racism.  Yes.  Racism.  And Michael Jackson thinks that everyone just turned their backs on him all of a sudden?  Yeah.  They turn their backs on Michael Jackson. 
[02:22:00]  He's not the Michael Jackson he was years ago when everything he put out was amazing and people were buying it.  He was barely a man, but he was still kind of a man.  Had his African features.  Remember?  And he had the afro and the big nostrils, the big lips.  And Thriller is, he was a little weird when Thriller was even starting to come out.  But all right, at least he was black.  Yeah.  Then all of a sudden, you're like, what happened? 
[02:22:30]  You got to put that cleft in his chin.  The nose is, it's an abomination.  The surgeon should just be thrown out of the medical community.  The surgeon that did that work.  They cannot photograph this guy without it.  You're looking and going, oh my God.  You could sew with it.  It's this little point thing on his face.  And Al Sharpton, I will never listen to until he stops having hair like Fred Flintstone.  I don't like his stupid, flopped hair.  Ryan, what's going on? 
[02:23:00]  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  You know, I'm not a big fan of Michael Jackson at all.  You know, I barely know the guy at all.  I mean, the dude's whiter than me.  But he does, I heard, have like some kind of rare skin cancer.  And that's why, you were talking about that before.  He was like walking around with an umbrella and he wears like a face mask.  Yeah, I know.  I've heard that too.  Yeah, well, anyways, that's what I just wanted to, you know, defend him on that point.  That means you can take all your black features away, right?  That's the problem.  Yeah, exactly.  Not the skin color, dude.  It's the hair and the lips and being thinned out and the nose being thinned out. 
[02:23:30]  And I'll tell you, it isn't a skin disease that he wears that mask over his face.  He's had so much surgery and there's so much scar tissue on his nose that the sun will make it fall off,  which would just be hysterically funny.  All right, you want to hear another clip?  We are today calling for a meeting with every head of every record company,  from Doug Morris to Clive Davis to Tommy Mottola, 
[02:24:00]  to begin to discuss artist contracts and their business dealings in the African-American community.  Oh, shut up, you ass.  We'll never be taken seriously.  Like, they got time to meet with Reverend Al.  Reverend Al's follies come into town and they got time to meet and discuss that.  A lot of these record company owners are black guys, too.  There's plenty of black labels around.  You're going to talk to Barry Gordy, too, stupid?  Yeah.  He's an ignorant F. 
[02:24:30]  Very.  Because it happens to the white artists as well.  Right.  Tell me Motown wasn't F.  He just wants to ignore that part of it.  What?  You're telling me Motown?  I mean, they put out some of the best music ever,  but I'm sure they F people like RCA and everybody else did.  It's the nature of the business.  You have to be successful with more than just your debut album to make money in the industry,  and even then it's not a guarantee.  Jim, what's going on?  Nothing.  I'm just...  Go, Jim.  Yeah, what's up?  Go ahead.  Listen, Reverend Al, this is Michael for making fun of Mottola, 
[02:25:00]  because he defended Mottola yesterday in the pilot.  Yeah, but then he's jumping on the bandwagon about other record labels.  The guy sees an opportunity to get his fat head in front of a camera.  It's what he does.  It's what I've got to do.  And for Michael Jackson to come out against Tommy Mottola.  Jesus Christ.  The guy...  How much money did you lose for Mottola, you dick?  Wasn't he married to Mariah Carey?  Yeah.  How big a racist could he be being married to Mariah Carey?  Well...  Idiot. 
[02:25:30]  It's not like, you know, she's black.  She is part black.  She is.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  I know, but you look at her.  She's not Venus Williams.  Yeah, you're right.  Jesus.  But the guy is not a racist, man.  I'm telling you, I don't believe he's a racist at all.  No, I don't...  Well, as much as any Italian is.  Well, yeah.  But, you know...  Behind closed doors.  Yeah, in front of the family.  A lot of 2G words flying around, but...  We've got some more clips about this damn thing.  I think Michael Jackson is just looking for people to blame.  For him to use the race card is like OJ using the race card. 
[02:26:00]  There are real African Americans, everyday people who suffer the brunt of racism, and  it's disgraceful for Michael Jackson to be using that to excuse bad record sales because  his record just wasn't embraced by the public.  Yep.  Bravo.  It's an insult to black people that are experiencing racism for this idiot to come out and start  using the race card, just like it was, like the guy mentioned.  OJ, same thing.  He killed two white people.  Shut up.  He did.  And he got away with it using the race card, loading up the jury, and now Michael Jackson's  deciding, hey, you know, I'll pull out the race card, and now every black person is going 
[02:26:30]  to come to my defense.  And they will.  And, yeah.  Like lemmings.  I don't think they're going to come to me.  Oh, they will.  Yes, they will.  Oh, a lot of them will.  Yes, they will.  Oh, my God, a lot of them will.  Fortunately, though, the ones with any sense, and a lot of the people that do work in these  record companies, won't.  But he'll get that public black support behind him just because the second you scream racism,  the second a black guy screams racism, he has built-in support. 
[02:27:00]  Built-in.  I don't think the black community is going to support this guy.  OJ had a white wife.  He totally was nothing black about OJ.  And, yes, I'm telling you, you're wrong.  I don't think so.  You watch.  You have a built-in support group.  When you yell that, that's like that friggin' in case of emergency, break racism glass.  The second a black person needs to get support, all they have to do is scream racism, whether  it's a parent or not.  They just got to scream it.  And, boom, there's your backup group.  You go uptown.  You meet with Reverend Al. 
[02:27:30]  You start screaming.  There's crowds of people around.  Did you see that rally?  There were crowds of people around.  Michael, we love you.  You love him.  You love him.  The guy's allegedly, allegedly abusing children.  And no one cares that he outsold Elvis in the record industry, you idiot, because the  more records you sell, the more money they are making now.  They don't care if you outsold Elvis.  Nobody's against you outselling Elvis.  Did you ever hear that?  No!  Who knew it?  Damn that Michael Jackson. 
[02:28:00]  He outsold Elvis.  I'm so pissed off.  All Elvis did was black music anyway, so what's the difference?  Who cares?  He just took black music, he made it his own, and he became one of the hottest singers  ever.  There you go.  Like Eminem.  The record industry is dying.  They need a few hit records.  And Michael Jackson ain't this.  They'd be so happy if Michael Jackson's record was selling like that.  Yeah, they were really upset about Thriller.  You know, they were really upset.  The industry was crushed that Thriller was so good.  The numbers are so down in the record industry, they would kill for the record sales to go  through the roof for Michael Jackson.  And the economy blows, and these record companies can't afford to take the types of losses that 
[02:28:30]  someone like Michael Jackson put on them.  That freak.  We got another clip from Michael Musto from The Village Voice.  I think he can't admit defeat.  Like Mariah Carey when she had the bomb movie Glitter, it sent her into a tailspin emotionally.  Michael Jackson can't admit that he might not really be the king of pop anymore, even  though he demands that people call him the king of pop.  Who?  Well, self-proclaimed. 
[02:29:00]  The king of pop.  The king of pop.  You know, he's an artist that's, he's never changed with the times.  And it caught up with him.  Yeah.  Isn't this the video where they morph the faces? 
[02:29:30]  See, we're all one.  What happened to that, Michael?  We're all one.  What happened to Ebony and Ivory?  What happened to Ebony and Ivory?  What happened to him?  Oh!  My baby, it's no matter if you're black or white.  Megan, please!  My message in the sight of the sun  You're a Kentucky man 
[02:30:00]  Allegedly  And I told about equality  And it's you, either you're wrong or you're right  Help me! Help me! Help me!  You're not about my baby  It don't matter if you're black or white  Yep  I got it from the Negro  No, my brother  You got to buy your own  Come on, how about a good old nigger work song
