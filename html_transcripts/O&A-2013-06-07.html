<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a vulgar and sexually explicit introduction by Opie and Anthony, along with studio guest Jimmy, setting a tone of crude humor and suggestive banter that persisted throughout the show.  A weather report segment featuring meteorologist Chad devolved into mockery of his terminology.  The discussion then shifted to a Navy SEAL's gender transition, provoking discomfort and confused commentary from the hosts. This was followed by a lengthy, vulgar recounting of their impoverished childhoods and experiences with food, particularly bologna.  A scandalous relationship involving an offensively described co-worker (whose photo was comically juxtaposed with Darth Vader and a Stormtrooper) was discussed, followed by a mention of Donut Day and a comedian's Jay Leno appearance mocking the woman involved in the scandal.  They also recounted a meeting with professional wrestler Greg “The Hammer” Valentine. The show concluded this section with offensive commentary on the Miss World pageant in Indonesia, focusing on the Muslim women's attire.  Steppenwolf music was played at various points.

A subsequent segment focused on the podcast's success, subscriber numbers (acknowledging potential inaccuracies), and the importance of "nuggets" – engaging portions – in attracting listeners.  Past episodes with Courtney Love and Otto were mentioned, highlighting a funny moment from Otto's story.  The hosts addressed legal issues surrounding unauthorized online uploads and the financial impact of piracy.  This portion included a "barbecue day" segment with humorous commentary on their food consumption, featuring the recurring "Hoagie Boy" bit, several "FU Line" calls expressing anger at Sirius XM, a discussion of Prince's birthday and a related anecdote about Jim Brown, and Michael Cera's birthday.  The conversation moved to "This is the End,"  *Arrested Development*, and the hosts' opinions on shows like *Boardwalk Empire*, *Game of Thrones*, and *Breaking Bad*, including a discussion of *Arrested Development*'s hipster appeal and a related banana stand anecdote.  A past rotting apple bit was mentioned, along with a discussion of a "goof" of a gift from Paul Anka and gift-giving etiquette.  A heated exchange ensued with caller Steve, a black man, criticizing Anthony's views on race, followed by similar commentary from a veteran caller, Andrew.  This discussion involved crime statistics, media representation, and societal issues.

A significant part of the show revolved around Anthony’s anger towards perceived media bias in reporting race-related crime, specifically the underreporting of black-on-white violence.  He argued this stemmed from a desire for superiority, not racial justice. Several callers offered varying viewpoints and experiences, with one black caller agreeing with Anthony's perspective but criticizing his aggressive delivery.  A chaotic discussion ensued about the cancellation and partial restoration of "Barbecue Day," due to weather, the pit masters’ unavailability, and possibly hurt feelings over on-air comments.  There was much speculation about responsibility for the miscommunication.  The segment concluded with the arrival of one pit master and the consumption of barbecue; they also showed and commented on Eddie Money's daughter's television appearance.

A segment featuring Daniel Vaughn, barbecue editor for *Texas Monthly*, who brought brisket and pork ribs, involved enthusiastic consumption and digressions into discussions of interns' hair, E-Rock's failed Vine videos (featuring Sal and Roland), Roland's twitching eye, and Vaughn’s book, *The Prophets of Smoked Meat*.  Topics included barbecue festivals, Anthony Bourdain's publishing, Roy Choi’s Kogi BBQ, and recurring technical difficulties. Anthony’s *Today* show appearance was mentioned.  A rambling discussion about a “top secret experiment” followed, interspersed with discussions about barbeque wood types, a Superman screening, and a coworker's peculiar gait. The segment concluded with speculation about a 10-year-old needing a lung transplant, which led to a search for a photo of Pat from Wunaki’s girlfriend on Facebook, and plans for a party at Anthony's house.


The final segment centered on Anthony's upcoming pool party, discussing the guest list (including E-Rock, Troy, Bobo, Denny as a DJ, Sal, Joe DeRosa, and people from the Ron and Fez show), vulgar banter about the anticipated atmosphere and the presence of women, and the use of misogynistic and homophobic slurs.  The possibility of karaoke and music choices was discussed,  along with extensive arrangements for Denny's DJing despite a communion conflict ("hot deuce" repeatedly referenced).  Anthony's "PA of the house," Angela, and her role in managing party aftermath (including misplaced bathing suits), was mentioned. The origin of the party (stemming from E-Rock's wife's "dildo party") was revealed, along with mentions of multiple photos of Bobo and a description of a picture of Anthony's kitchen with a sniper rifle. The segment concluded with final party arrangements and music.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Earth show.  What before has one radio show been so extreme?  Oh my god!  So vulgar.  Fuck you, I'm not a pussy!  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  This is insane. I mean, this is insane.  So flagellant. 
[00:00:30]  Why don't we even try?  Let's just fart into the mics and call it a day.  This is the funniest shit ever.  It's a weird show.  That's what's real.  That's sex.  Oh!  Tune in with no expectations.  Point simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Here we are.  Yoke and Anthony's show.  Another four hours of love.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:01:00]  Check.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Check it.  I'm up early in the morning.  Yawning.  With Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, Jimmy Tranny pointing.  Opie like brother man.  Ant wants to join the clan.  Jimmy on the other hand.  He working all the hands.  Turn my headphones up!  There are horrible people.  What do you say in this old?  I'll get you all you mean.  And I want you to know.  Unacceptable to my scene.  But I'll give it a go.  50 cent Larry King.  Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:01:30]  Go.  Go.  I know you're building the flow.  But Opie's motherfucking things trying to get blown.  Then we come to play around and we're still in the show.  I know you never heard nothing like this before.  How important is the board?  Board you'll never be.  And don't worry about getting shot when you're with Anthony.  Boom.  Yeah.  On the edge of your chair.  Cause you really want to hear Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy.  Just keep it right here.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Check it out.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  50.  Yeah.  Now I'm typing up in this bitch.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Booga booga.  Booga booga.  Enough of this plava.  Let's get this show on the road.  Yeah.  And we begin.  That song is so fucking good, man.  It certainly is.  It's so good we played it twice this week.  Yeah.  Hope you enjoyed that.  That's right.  You've lingered longer. 
[00:02:30]  Friday.  Friday.  It's raining here in New York and it's going to rain all weekend and what is this?  Tropical storm shit.  Yes.  The first one of the season.  Right.  It's down there in Florida though, isn't it?  It's moving.  It seems to be moving fast.  Yeah.  And it's got its little arms way out there.  Way out there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Let's ask Chad. 
[00:03:00]  Chad.  The news loves it though.  I heard John.  Can you tell us what's happening, Chad?  Chad.  You let me talk.  Chad.  Nine millibars of pressure on the mercury and.  Oh, Chad.  But the storm was 900 and two millibars.  Nine oh two was the lowest that you had with this storm a couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit.  Filled in with some air.  Okay.  So Chad.  Not as low pressure.  But Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol. 
[00:03:30]  Translate that for us.  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Just emanculated.  Let me talk.  You let me talk.  Camille was nine oh eight.  Now he just doesn't know what he's saying.  Nine oh eight.  And then he's flustered.  Millibars.  Millibars.  No one wants your millibars.  Inches of mercury.  Did you have one of those barometric fucking things in your house going on?  A barometer?  A barometer or whatever the fuck.  No.  We had a lamp.  And it had like a sailor fucking thing on it.  It's always very nautical in the middle. 
[00:04:00]  It had the barometer.  And then did it have a...  We just stared at it.  We didn't know what it fucking meant.  And it barely moved.  Did it have symbols on the...  I guess.  When it was up really high, there'd be like the smiling sun.  Yeah.  And then when it's really low, there was the sea monster in the storm.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Wow.  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  But I remember year after year after year staring at the thing and it barely moved.  Yeah.  What a waste of time.  That barometer isn't really a real exciting instrument, Todd.  Oh, God, no.  It's not like a fucking weather vane. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Right.  I do recall making a barometer in science class.  Of course you did.  Why would you do that?  Why wouldn't you?  And then why wouldn't you continue your schooling?  I don't know.  You're a weirdo.  I made one out of a milk carton.  You were all in and then decided, ah, fuck all this.  I know.  Oh, that is weird.  People would have assumed I got on the drugs.  If you look at my schooling, it was like really good, really good.  Oh, it just fell off.  It was pussy.  It was pussy, man.  As soon as he got pussy, his life fell apart.  He started drinking and smoking.  You know, you're real.  I think you're right. 
[00:05:00]  Pussy was my drug.  I took a hit of pussy.  Well, with that said, how do you?  I smoked it like a bong.  How do you make a barometer?  I kind of forget, but it was a milk carton.  You used a quart milk carton on its side, and then you used some kind of paper clip dealy.  And then the actual trick to it was you had to get a single human hair, and you wound it around the paper clip. 
[00:05:30]  And another thing, part of the thing that you made a little pointer with, and the moisture in the air or something, the pressure would change, and the hair would expand and contract.  It's very odd.  Let's make someone, let's make Sal make a barometer today.  A barometer.  Out of C4.  And a hammer.  And then I'm looking at the front page of CNN, and we got a Navy SEAL guy who's now a chick. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we were looking at that.  Wow.  I don't know.  Are we supposed to be completely open-minded with this?  Yes.  Because this one I don't get.  The GLA, boy, that gay and lesbian organization's adding a lot of letters at the end.  They got to keep adding the letters.  They used to just be the gay and lesbian something, right?  And now it's transgender, so they put a TG at the end, and I'm fucking...  I can't wrap my head around the transgender thing.  It's strange to me. 
[00:06:30]  Well, as long as you can wrap your hand and mouth around it.  I don't know, because, I mean, if you're...  I don't know, man.  This is, like, fucking dangerous territory.  Everyone's listening, obviously.  Everybody's listening.  If we want more listeners, just get on the phone, apparently.  Yeah, no kidding.  Get on your phone, get on PalTalk, get on fucking Google.  I guess if you're born a guy, I don't understand in your head that...  Well, I understand, okay, I'm in the wrong body, but the problem is they can't make the 
[00:07:00]  other body good enough for you.  Not at this point.  And that's why I get confused by this whole thing, and I don't get it.  Uh-oh, you're confused?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, P.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, Peta.  Oh, Peta and Anthony.  No, no, no, no, no.  That's what I'm...  But you know what I mean?  Yeah.  He looks like a dude's dude.  That is a man's man.  He looks like a real man, like a man's man, as we like to talk about on the show. 
[00:07:30]  And he's a Navy SEAL.  And then they show him as this giant, like, woman now with huge shoulders.  And I don't know.  He comes out of his house in the video wearing a nice sensible dress.  Right.  High heels.  High heels.  Long hair.  And then he's getting a motorcycle out of the garage, and he's fucking picking the thing up like he's a moose.  Right.  You just see these big shoulders.  Right.  There could still be a lady and ride a motorcycle. 
[00:08:00]  But in his head, he feels better living that way.  Of course.  All right.  I get that.  Yeah.  Who's to say, you know?  But warrior princess is the tagline there on CNN's website.  Because, you know, Navy SEAL, big macho guy, and now a little princess.  Well, big princess.  Huge princess.  Huge princess.  That's a big bitch.  That princess does not need any rescuing.  No.  It's a self-rescuing princess. 
[00:08:30]  Wow.  Who's the...  So is he gay?  Then you get into that.  What is he now?  There's a whole thing going on with the transgender.  But now he's not gay anymore because now he's a female that hangs out with guys?  It's like, I don't know.  I don't know.  We don't know.  When you add that transgender in, it's like, well, it's a man.  Now he's dressed like a woman.  Is it post-op?  Pre-op?  Is it any op going on?  And then it's like, you're not gay because now you're a woman. 
[00:09:00]  But before that, you were gay because...  See?  I don't know.  Or do you go from a guy to a girl and become a lesbian?  Like, I don't understand.  I don't think transsexuals are...  Genders?  I don't think they consider themselves gay.  I don't know.  I don't know what they consider.  I think they consider themselves almost like a third thing.  Like, it's a different...  A gay guy wants to just be a guy.  Keep all the guy parts.  Be a guy with other guys. 
[00:09:30]  Transgender, you don't even want to be the guy part.  So, technically, you're not gay because you consider yourself a chick.  It's just bizarre.  That's what I mean.  Yeah, please try running all this through your head while you're jerking off to Bailey J's pictures.  I'm kidding.  I don't do that.  It's a good line, though.  It's a very good line.  It's a terrific line.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  That's on the front page of CNN, so I was like, fuck.  The video was very strange. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that video is...  They just kept showing scene after scene of him as a Navy SEAL.  But good for him.  That's a...  I'd say...  Yeah.  That is...  I was going to say a ballsy move, but that's a ball-less move.  It doesn't make me mad or anything, by the way.  These type of stories, there are people out there that it makes them mad and shit.  I'm not saying that.  It's just very...  I don't know.  I just don't understand the whole thing.  I honestly believe that the more angry you get at things like this, the more you're trying 
[00:10:30]  to tamp down your own fucking feelings.  Yeah.  If you notice, the people that protest the most against, like, sex, usually a scandal  pops out.  Right.  It's very sexual.  Gay, child molestation and shit like that.  It's always those people that are, like, protesting the most.  Yeah.  Yeah, why else would they?  Yeah, why would you care about that?  Well, these people will never fucking be involved in your life in any way where it should be bothersome.  Yeah.  You're right. 
[00:11:00]  Does that mean I want to be black?  Yeah.  No one in.  Or you don't want people to know that you might have a little black in you.  Oh, my God.  You know, the Sicilians.  You know.  The Sicilians.  One less cigarette.  Or the Moors, right?  The Moors.  You see the Moors.  Oh, I love this guy.  It's Donut Day, right?  That's the big news, though.  Today's Donut Day or is it Cronut Day?  I think the Cronut's trying to fucking, you know, get a foot in the door there, but it's Donut Day. 
[00:11:30]  Not a huge fan of the Donut.  Never have been.  I like a fresh, glazed donut.  I know.  Where you break it apart.  It's very, like, nice.  With nothing in it?  You know what?  That is the dumbest thing ever.  You gotta have that fucking filling shit.  I like those, too.  Sometimes the glazed donut is fucking good, man.  I like a filling, but sometimes the glazed donut is delicious.  Yeah, yeah.  Airy.  Yeah, but then you're like, all right, there should be some shit in here now.  No, you could get some with some shit in it at some point. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  You know, I do like a good apple-filled.  Well, that one I do like.  That's good.  And I like the ones with the chocolate on top and the cream in the mouth.  How do you feel about Bavarian cream?  Nice.  I like a good Bavarian cream.  You feel like shit immediately after you eat it, though.  Oh, that fucking...  We're not talking to the fatties out there.  They don't understand this concept, but there are people, you eat one lousy, shitty thing  and immediately feel like crap.  You rock?  Oh.  You rock doesn't like sweets. 
[00:12:30]  We've been over this.  You don't eat cake or anything, Eric?  He doesn't really like the sweets.  Not usually, no.  Wow.  You rock likes a good steak martini.  Yeah.  That steak martini, man.  What is your downfall?  What for you is like you can never say no to it?  A good sandwich, I guess.  What kind of sandwich?  What sandwich for you?  A sandwich.  If someone says, hey, let's have a whatever, you're like, I can't.  A nice hoagie.  A nice hoagie. 
[00:13:00]  I'll be honest.  The hoagie is a motherfucker, man.  His mouth is watering as it says.  Oil and vinegar.  You like tomato pickles.  What do you like?  Salami?  Not so much of the Italian meats.  What do you like?  I'll eat them.  Yeah.  Ham from fucking Capacol.  What kind of cured meats do you like?  Cured meats.  What kind of cured?  Oh, we already know.  Olive loaf.  He's the olive loaf.  Oh, the olive loaf.  That is good.  That's not my go-to.  No one eats olive loaf.  It's terrible.  It looks like ham with cancer. 
[00:13:30]  It really does.  Yuck.  What kind do you like?  Well, ham and Swiss usually.  That is a good one.  All right.  Now you're talking.  Shredded lettuce.  I like some boar's head bologna.  Bologna.  Bologna is like.  Bologna is overrated, too.  It's terrible.  It's awful.  It's the white trash of fucking meat.  When you can get roast beef or ham or.  Yeah.  Turkey and roast beef.  Yeah, but salami.  Why would you go with fucking bologna?  I do like a good salami provolone.  Some fucking peppers on there.  Marron.  Oil and vinegar.  Marron.  We were so poor growing up that we got the bologna thing, but we had to cut our own 
[00:14:00]  slices, and the slices were always too thick, which took away from the taste of having a  bologna sandwich.  You know, you could have just gone down to the, like, deli.  Right.  And bring your bologna and say, excuse me, sir, could you slice this for me?  And, you know, for a nominal fee of a couple of bucks, I'm sure.  But the outer skin was a little tougher, so I don't know where the fuck.  I think they were getting some cheap bologna, man.  And you can never slice it thin enough, so you're chewing on these big. 
[00:14:30]  No, it's horrible.  That's why I hate bologna to this day.  Nothing worse than thickly cut, cold cuts.  You can't.  No, you've got to have them as thin as possible.  Like, I remember going into the deli with my mommy, and she'd be like, and I want to  slice tissue paper thin.  Right.  And, boy, if they didn't slice it thin enough, that Nazi that worked by the counter.  Where it was like, phew.  Yeah.  You should be able to blow on the slice and have it go, phew, phew, phew.  Flood apart in your hand.  Yes.  It's very hard to get off in a slice. 
[00:15:00]  That's the best.  Fuck.  I knew it.  What happened?  Damn it.  Donut day.  This was Paul Anka day.  I was going to bring that stupid, shitty gift in today.  I knew I forgot something at home today.  Anyway, bologna.  Fuck.  Yeah, bologna stinks.  And when you do have to peel that fucking plastic from around the edge of the whole thing.  No, there's only one type of bologna.  Bore's head?  Yeah.  That's it.  Everyone else sucks.  You're a boar's head.  Did you have...  Did you have individually sliced cheese? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You go to the deli and just get the...  We didn't.  What, big brick of cheese?  Yep.  And same fucking thing.  You couldn't cut that shit thin enough.  No offense, though, but yours was the type of house I never wanted to go to after school.  No kidding.  No good fucking cookies.  No good fucking...  Powdered milk?  Yeah, you just get like, oh, God, I'm going to the user's house.  Well, every once in a while they would mix the powdered milk with the regular milk to give us a taste of the real shit.  Every once in a while.  Oh, when I was invited to someone else's house, holy fuck, did I take advantage. 
[00:16:00]  Like Disney, right?  Dude, like just having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on Wonder Bread?  Oh.  We didn't have that.  There's the thin peppered farm bread.  Oh, that you already buy stale?  Yeah.  Like fresh peppered farm bread is stale.  And then the jelly soaks through it within two seconds of making the sandwich?  Yeah.  But man, I would go to my friend's house and they would fucking take out that Wonder Bread.  Wonder Bread.  And peanut butter with a label on it.  I was like, fuck, is that jiffy? 
[00:16:30]  That's like name brand stuff.  See, they don't have no frills anymore.  I talk about it every once in a while on the show.  The white label with the black writing that just said peanut butter.  I don't know.  They don't have that anymore, right?  At Pathmart.  They've made it look better.  They have store brands like CVS for Medicine.  And they make it look closer to real brands.  But no frills had to change the names because they would have frosted flakes.  Right.  Frosty Flakes.  Frosty Flakes or something that just never tasted anywhere as close to the real thing.  They do have it.  Cheapios. 
[00:17:00]  I haven't seen no frills anymore.  But each store relabels it in their own brand.  Right.  Like Walmart has America's Choice, but it's all no frills stuff.  Yeah.  No one says no frills anymore because no one will buy it.  I think they upped the quality a little bit, too, though.  Because no frills.  Yeah.  They couldn't.  They had to rework the names of everything.  Sliced carrots.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  This is my childhood.  Everything was a white label in our...  Potted meat.  In our cabinets.  I believe I see one of them peckers right here.  It's a bit loud.  A bit loud. 
[00:17:30]  No frills is like fucking Dharma Initiative food.  I can't beat up my parents for that.  I mean, we had seven kids, plus we were always taking in kids left and right.  That's crazy.  The resentment I would have, by the way.  What?  Holy fuck.  Like, if I was eating no frills stuff and shit bread.  Yeah.  And then they'd bring in more kids?  Yeah.  I'd be like, fuck, man.  How about you don't bring in the kids and feed the ones you got the name brand shape?  Yeah.  One day, they just introduced someone as my sister. 
[00:18:00]  She was 15 years old.  All right.  And then she couldn't stand my mom, so at 18, she fucking checked out and said, see you  later.  I'm not your sister anymore.  Left.  And I haven't seen her since.  That's odd.  I think a few of my siblings recently contacted her on Facebook, though.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She was basically told she's our sister for about four years.  Not, this is my sister's friend that needs a home to live.  It's your sister.  And this is your sister. 
[00:18:30]  And she had reddish hair, so she sort of fit in.  She kind of fit in with everybody else.  You fucker!  And one day, man, she had a boyfriend come over and they packed her shit in a fucking  pickup.  Took off.  And I remember being really sad because I bought in that she's my sister.  You lost the sister.  And we kind of liked her.  We liked her a lot, actually.  I shouldn't say kinda.  Oh, man.  And she goes, basically, I can't take this shit anymore.  Wow.  And she took off and that was it for, I haven't seen her since. 
[00:19:00]  I was probably, I don't know, 13 or 14 when she left, probably.  And that was it.  Yeah.  I'd have been peeking into that room.  I'd have been trying to see her fucking tits.  I used to love that when my sister would bring her friends over.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was the best.  Just fucking trying to spy on him.  Poking holes in the wall and shit.  Just trying to spy on him.  Make him play sexual games.  Yeah, that's crazy.  What a predator. 
[00:19:30]  The only reason that's crazy is because you are sacrificing that you will see your sister  and, you know.  I tried to keep her out of it, but, you know, collateral damage.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm trying to say this carefully.  Yeah, yeah.  But it was absolutely, you have to, it had to be collateral damage.  Yes.  You don't want to see your sister in these situations.  See, I'm talking very vague because I love Dawn.  Hey, Rock Comet, wasn't the story that you used to make them do handstands?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  They would all be, for the slumber parties, they would all be in their little nightgowns. 
[00:20:00]  And nightgowns, you know, fucking, they're wearing little panties and stuff like that.  And then I would make them do handstand, headstand contests against the wall, you know.  Right.  But when it was your sister's turn, what'd you do?  Well, no, they would all line up against the wall, so it wasn't each one's turn.  So you were able to, like, you know.  Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't look at it.  You would try to get Dawn on the end.  Right, right, right.  On the end.  Get her in my peripheral vision.  Right, so visually she's not in front and center.  Look, and their nightgowns would just flop over their heads upside down, and I would see 
[00:20:30]  their little peenies.  Oh, so that's where you got it when we were at AAF.  And we're still playing those shenanigans at AAF.  I was still playing those fucking games.  The only station that really rocks.  Yeah.  Giving us a rock bus was not a good idea.  Oh, my God.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, we literally did the headstand thing with the girls in the rock bus.  For some reason, we had to paint targets on boobs.  Why did we paint targets on boobs?  Do you remember? 
[00:21:00]  I don't know.  I think it was just funny.  What?  I stopped myself.  Well, there might have been some dart boards that were being fucking sharpied on some girls.  But why?  I don't know.  Well, I understand why it was an excuse to see.  Yeah.  But why did we make like a bullseye and a dart board on them?  I don't know.  Maybe it was wishful thinking that we would be shooting something.  I always found that. 
[00:21:30]  Why did we pick that?  Yeah.  A bullseye.  Anyway.  No frills.  Navy SEAL.  Stupid weather.  Yeah, we're fucked as far as the weather goes.  You're going to have a shitty weekend.  Yeah.  Well, I'm on Red Eye tonight.  Nice.  Oh, yeah?  City Bank.  Yeah.  I'm on Monday. 
[00:22:00]  It's a real O&A wraparound.  It really is.  I guess we'll be talking about a lot of this government infiltration into the internet.  That's no big deal.  No big deal?  It's a little bit.  It's a big deal.  It's a donut day.  Distract everyone on a donut day.  There are other things that are just really disturbing.  I know.  I know.  Oh, shit.  I told you.  Wait.  No, leave him alone.  I'm not going to say where, but why is that even news?  I don't know.  At this point.  They're dragging him in because it's not fair. 
[00:22:30]  Is it history stuff?  Huh?  He's such a nice guy.  Yeah, just leave him alone.  She's hateable.  Leave him alone.  HATEABLE!  HATEABLE.  Leave a fucking fat mess.  Leave him alone.  Wait, is that?  Who is that?  That's Star Wars.  Looks better here.  Yeah, a little bit.  Wait, that's Star Wars.  That's Star Wars.  You sure?  Wait, wait.  If so.  Wait, wait.  Wait, show me.  I'll know in a second.  Yes, it is her.  Let me see.  That's her.  It's absolutely her.  Oh, it is.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  She looks better there. 
[00:23:00]  What the fuck?  She grew into her chub a little bit.  Yeah.  I still will never get that image out of my head.  No one will.  No one will.  She's the fuck.  What a frump.  What a fucking frump.  Oh, God.  You think the head's going to be a little further down?  Leave him alone.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  This is way too...  Can I see that?  I can't see.  This is way too inside.  Let's move on.  Right between the Stormtrooper and Darth Vader. 
[00:23:30]  Okay.  God Vader and the Stormtrooper.  What a delightful photo.  Nice, sexy sandals.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Dumpy fucking fatso.  Like your shorts?  No, I don't, actually.  That's not a good trade-off.  I don't at all like your shorts.  That's not a good trade-off.  Those are terrible.  A career.  Yeah, a career for that fucking...  Fat pig in Gilligan shorts.  Oh, my God, no.  I'm not saying he was an angel or he was smart,  but she's a fucking fat rat snitch 
[00:24:00]  fucking perpetual victim changing her story.  Yep.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, we fooled around in the hotel.  It was fun.  And then all of a sudden fucking...  Oh, no, he made me.  He pushed me against the door.  Shut up.  There's no way that guy made her.  No, he's a fucking eight and a half.  She's a fucking two.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  All right, well...  I'm going to hug him when I see him.  I know, right?  Dude, you know what?  It's easy to make fun of you, which we do. 
[00:24:30]  However...  Yeah, look.  It's hard.  You got to understand what our position is.  Yeah.  Why did you sting me?  Well, I'm a scorpion.  Yes.  It's the old gag.  That's what we do.  Yeah.  Poor frog.  Anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  I love this on PalTalk.  Wow.  This is a good microcosm of our listeners, PalTalk.  There are fans that know everything on here, and there are other peripheral ones that don't.  It's like anyone else confused. 
[00:25:00]  Like, a lot of people won't understand what we're talking about.  We completely understand we're confusing people.  Yeah, yeah.  We know.  But we don't want to bring the guy's name up.  It turns out he's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  Says hello every morning.  Right.  There's somebody...  And they brought him up in the paper today, and he works here.  Right.  That was involved in some kind of scandalous relationship that made the news a while ago.  He had sex with a woman who looks like Meat Loaf in 1980.  And, you know, and we made fun of the fact that her picture is here between a Star Wars 
[00:25:30]  and, like, I guess it, what, ABC Studios or Universal somewhere.  I don't know where it is.  A stormtrooper.  Yeah, a stormtrooper and Darth Vader.  And she's holding a blaster, and she just looks like the Jabba the Hutt stand-in.  She's a frump.  She's a frump.  She's a frump.  She's the perfect definition of a frump.  And I guess because of this liaison that he had, he was, you know, canned from certain  jobs.  Did he lose his wife over that?  There was marital problems, I gather.  But he ends up here, and we see him in the hallways a lot, and I just feel bad for the 
[00:26:00]  guy.  Well, we saw him after we went all in on this story.  Yeah, yeah.  We did go all in.  And if you've lingered longer, you know, because we've talked about this story in depth  at one point.  And now we see him almost every day.  And he's just a nice...  He's the nicest guy.  I made fun of him on Leno.  I did one of my segments.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and I bashed.  And in the rehearsal, when I was doing the Jay Leno show, they're like, they weren't  sure.  They're like, we're not sure about that one, because the girl complained recently that 
[00:26:30]  Jay mocked her, and she's depressed.  And then they're like, but that's really funny.  Fuck it, just do it.  Oh, wow.  Really?  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Fuck it, just do it.  Do they say that, too?  Fuck it, just do it.  Yeah, I think it was probably the exact producer.  That's great.  You know, fuck it, just do it.  Is that the mascot for colorectal cancer?  It's a donut.  Yeah.  It's a giant chocolate donut dancing outside of Fox.  Free Krispy Kreme donuts for everyone today?  Yeah, Dunkin' Donuts is doing a free donut if you buy a beverage. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  I don't like that if shit, because then it's not free.  No.  Free should be, I have no money in my pocket, and look, I walked away with this.  It's such a stupid...  Do you know one time he grabbed me, and he goes, do you know that if is an in-alert in  life?  What are they going to say?  He was a wise man?  He enjoyed a hoagie?  A hoagie.  He doesn't like his hoagies.  But Krispy Kreme said, fuck that, just come in and get a free donut?  Yeah, Krispy Kreme.  That's why they're the kings.  That's why they're the kings.  Two hours.  The line will be two hours for a free...  It's amazing for a free donut. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, free food really gets the people going.  Yeah.  Even when I was really fucking poor, and I searched out the free food, I just couldn't  be bothered with lines.  Ever.  Well, that's a big bitch.  Holy shit, what is this?  I don't know.  Holy fuckaroni.  Well, that's different than what I just saw.  God damn, they're showing some really hot fucking...  Fox and Friends, what is this?  It's raining out.  It looks like a montage.  It's a week wit.  That's Randy Orton from WWE.  Yeah, they're doing...  Oh, it's a montage. 
[00:28:00]  They're doing a montage of everything they did this week.  A montage.  Did you see my photo last night of the famous wrestler?  Greg the Hammer Valentine?  Yeah.  You got a picture with Greg the Hammer Valentine.  I did.  Holy fuck.  I did a fucking...  How's he look?  I had a...  Insane Clown Posse has a show on Fuse, which I was...  It's almost like a mystery science theater where you sit there, you watch a couple videos,  you make fun of the videos with those guys, and they just bullshit with you.  Oh, yeah.  And sitting with them on the set is a...  It's almost like a bar setup.  They have a fucking really big dude with fucking tattoos and neck tattoos, and they have fucking 
[00:28:30]  Greg the Hammer Valentine standing behind there dressed like an usher.  And there's a really pretty girl, a beautiful woman who ushers you down.  So the two ushers are Greg the Hammer Valentine and this really hot chick.  So I didn't recognize him.  So I made fun of him sitting there, saying that he looks like a chick I fucked.  Because I thought...  I said something, and one of the guys goes, that's the hammer.  And so I made fun of him.  And then he walks over and escorts me off the set. 
[00:29:00]  Like, that was part of the end of the interview.  Right.  And I forget what one of them said, and I just realized the hammer...  I'm like, oh my fucking God.  He looks good.  You're Greg the Hammer Valentine.  Yeah.  He looks good.  And he was really a nice guy.  Wait, so that's all he does for the show?  I don't know.  That was all he did during my segment.  Like, Tom Green taped before me, and they got Gilbert coming in.  Like, they're using a bunch of comedians.  But I had no idea that was him until...  Thank God I fucking found out before I left.  I would have shot myself.  Yeah, right?  Sure.  What a nice guy he is, man. 
[00:29:30]  A fucking nice man.  What's his deal, though?  He rolls deep on the convention circuit.  He's not a tough one to get.  No.  It's still a nice photo.  He's not wrestling anymore.  He's not really at me.  It's great that he's in a weird bellhop house.  That's the best.  He's not wrestling?  No.  Definitely not.  Look at his fucking forearms, dude.  Look at how big that guy is.  Yeah, he is.  He's an older guy.  You know what he does?  This is his deal now.  I just remembered.  He charges...  If you go, you pay for a picture and an autograph.  And then what he will do... 
[00:30:00]  I don't know how much he charges for it.  But you can take off your shirt.  And he'll slap you across the chest.  I forgot he used to do that.  And he lights people up at these conventions.  They hurt?  Yeah.  Would you do that?  I don't know.  It's hard not to, right?  Yeah, I kind of want to.  Like taking a fucking...  Taking a shot from Tyson or something.  Yeah.  But yeah, I've seen him.  Like these dopes go.  And they're like, oh yeah, I'll take a chop from the hammer.  And he lights them up.  And their girlfriends are there just watching him get beat up by Greg the Hammer Valentine. 
[00:30:30]  He's probably banging him.  The Hammer.  Yeah.  I remember him.  Oh yeah, that is him.  Yeah.  Very cool.  He had a big feud with rugged Ronnie Garvin.  I don't remember him.  No, I don't remember him either.  But you're going deep now.  I know, I did that perfectly.  I don't know, yeah.  Of course you did.  I heard a story from...  I can't...  I'll tell you off the air.  Oh.  Wow, come on.  We've already been ridiculously vague in this first hour.  I know, I know.  I just can't.

[00:38:00]  holding in  indonesia  why are they  doing it there  exactly  that's what i  said  why  the muslims  in indonesia  which apparently  indonesia is  just packed  with muslims  you know how i  know because  jonathan loves it  his favorite  place on earth  he likes going  there  loves it  wow  he's crazy  miss galaxy  is it  uh  and here's  here's what's  going on  they're not  allowed to  appear in  swimsuits  the bikini thing  which is a huge  part of this  pageant  they have to  cover up because 
[00:38:30]  it insults the  muslims  miss world  miss world  it was miss  world  but you know  what why would  i don't even  fault them  thank you  take the  pageant  i'm sorry  you can't fault  indonesia if  that's what  they're about  but to take  the pageant  there is  ridiculous  that's when  you step in  and go well  no thank you  we have to  have the  bikini thing  that's what  what do you  expect muslims  to do  we know  they're going  to do that  so what  are they going  to replace  that way  they're covering  them up with  fucking  burkas  they have to  wear the  official swimsuit  like with a  sarong 
[00:39:00]  they have to  wear a swimsuit  that any muslim  woman would have  to wear  can we see what  that looks like  i'm sure it's so  sexy  yeah  muslims  they are wacky  that's irritating  but  they're not going  to be wearing  this  they're going  to be wearing  that  that's what  they have to  wear  islamic  swimwear  oh how awful  their head  they're totally  covered  except their  face  hands  and just  a little bit  of their  they're wearing  clothes in the  pool  yeah  because their  men cannot  handle  looking at  it's fucking  embarrassing 
[00:39:30]  as the guy  just walks out  with just  swim trunks  some hairy  dick  sticking out  look in 2013  i gotta be honest  that's a lame  ass religion  holy shit  sorry  you got a silly  religion  when you gotta  wrap your  women up  how do we  even  like it's so  archaic  it's so  misogynistic  the whole  religion  is misogynistic  yet  we're supposed  to be  we're supposed  to not be  misogynistic  ourselves  and even the  slightest hint  of it  will bring the  wrath of the 
[00:40:00]  national organization  of women  and everything  if you make  a joke  a rape joke  anything like  that  yet  we have to  be tolerant  of a religion  that wraps  women up  because their  bodies are  shameful or  something  they just  can't handle  looking at  it's astounding  you're missing  the obvious  here with this  website  what's that  the women  are modeling  these  fucking  what do you  call them  swimsuits  body  kineys  they're called  and they're  making it look  like look how  much fun this is  they're having  a pisser 
[00:40:30]  aren't they  not acknowledging  that that would  really suck to  walk around like  that in a hundred  degree weather  she's all hot  she's riding a jet  ski  but she's smiling  like this is great  look at me  wrapped up  they treat their  women like shit  like shit  like shit  I saw a fucking  it must have been  a muslim couple  driving yesterday  and the guy  is in a t-shirt  and he's fucking  driving his car  he's fine  and then his  his woman  is in the  passenger seat  fucking wrapped  up from head  to toe 
[00:41:00]  just sweating  I told you  last year  we went on  a quick vacation  and there was  a couple  with kids  that you know  camped out  right next to us  but the woman  was carrying  everything  like a camel  the guy  has just  it was a  brutal day  it was like  95 degrees  out  he's just  got swim  trunks on  no shirt  and flip flops  and he's just  walking down  to the spot  on the beach  and she's  trailing behind  with the kids  and everything  I mean she's  carrying everything  and then he's  standing there  waiting for her  to set up  and she sets 
[00:41:30]  everything up  and then he  finally  I forgot if he  sat or laid  down on like  a towel  and now she's  in full burka  mode where you  can't even see  her face sitting  there just  fucking miserable  sweating her  ass off  you can't  criticize that  because it's  religion  right  you know  meanwhile  it's fucking  it's a choice  but wouldn't you feel  like an asshole  if you were the  guy in that  religion  that's what  I don't understand  is like  you're okay  looking like a  complete asshole  if you weren't  a Muslim  and you treated  your wife like  this  yes  you would have  the neighbors 
[00:42:00]  would call the  cops on you  but the only  difference is  that you practice  a certain religion  and that makes it  okay  well religion  yeah  you can't fuck  it's astounding  it's astounding  though because  the treatment  itself  would be  catamount to  abuse  everyone around  that day  was just so  mad at the  guy like  are you serious  yeah  everyone understood  it's their religion  but the guy  in that situation  looks like a  complete asshole  but the fact  that it's your  religion  I've had enough  of that 
[00:42:30]  on all sides  right  oh you know  the religion  that's cool  up till the age  of 10  but how about  after that  as you get  older  you have  a choice  yeah  if you want  to stick  with it  or if you  want to  fucking  move along  right  so if you  stick with it  and this is  all the religions  fuck you  yeah  fuck you  I'm sick  of it  well you know  religion  so what  how can you  base your life  and make that  kind of sacrifice  to a man  and have any  self respect  based on some  magical mystical 
[00:43:00]  story  because they don't  know any better  they were brought  up in it  it really is abuse  this is why  religious people  can be really  irritating  because they  attack gays  who really  are born a  certain way  and they're  terrible  you as religious  people are making  a choice to  remain religious  right  you're not born  religious you  dumb motherfuckers  you're making a  decision  right  to be religious  you were born  to be wild  you were born  to be fucking  wild  born to be wild  right Iraq  making that  decision  but fucking  going after people  who were born  a certain way 
[00:43:30]  yeah  I never  I never got it  look at this  what are you  doing  Iraq  do you got  that  I love it  do you like  any other  Steppenwolf 
[00:44:00]  songs  I like to  the cults  version of this  it's pretty good  oh yeah  but do you like  any other  Steppenwolf  no  what else is there  the pusher man  nah  can you give me  the pusher man  this is a  basic karaoke song  this is one of the  basics  it's still great  somebody can just  step up if they've  never done karaoke  before this is one  of them that's like  you can do this  oh you can  yeah yeah  anyone can sing

[00:45:30]  but you got a  little CCR  it sounds a  little like CCR  when they slow  their shit down  a bit  yeah  and the vocal  I think I have  an idea why  it's more  melodic  it's more  melodic  oh really  it has to do  with the guy  singing it  is the vocal  I don't know  maybe  no he doesn't  like the white  man blues  either  I don't like  the white  man blues  either  no  I love the  black man blues  god damn  you guys got a  great voice  the pusher 
[00:46:00]  pretty Vietnam  era  psychedelic  this has some  psychedelia blues  in it  I would definitely  sit back  put those big  70s headphones  on  fucking smoke  a big  fatty  and just  shut your eyes  and go  yeah  let's just get  high man  and then all of a sudden  I'd get this squirt  of adrenaline  and I'd start  freaking out  and I'd open my eyes  and be like  ah why am I here  and I'd freak out

[00:47:30]  maybe  where the girls  are dancing  in his fucking club  and the song comes on  and they're up  on the balcony  dancing  girls dance  in like  fucking 60s  kind of dance  it's just so sexy  little mini skirts  or hot pants  there was a good scene  in an Austin Powers movie  it probably wasn't  the third one  probably not  oh wow  was that the Beyonce one  yeah  with a gold member  yeah  Mike Myers  kind of dropped off  a bit  a little bit  yeah baby  we had him on  when everyone's  doing that  we had him on  just as he jumped 
[00:48:00]  over the fucking cliff  oh it was for that  stupid love guru  movie  that was terrible  love guru  after 300 million dollar  movies in a row  sometimes you just  take a few years off  I know right  we're fucking bashing  for the love guru  meanwhile he had  you know  then he did another  fucking hits  yeah yeah  oh he does Shrek  that's right  yeah  yeah  oh the love guru  imagine having  Austin Powers and Shrek  and the fucking  and Wayne's World  fucking Wayne's World  made quite a bit of money  so what happened with this guy  why the big drop off 
[00:48:30]  how much  how long can you make  that kind of money for  how long can you keep doing that  yeah but you mentioned  Mike Myers now  people are like  they think  for a while  Mike Myers was that  it went between  Halloween movies  and him  and if you said  Mike Myers  you're like  oh Halloween movies  it's like  no no Mike Myers  and then it went  Mike Myers  oh the guy  from Austin Powers  now I think it's  back to Halloween  yeah we're back  to Halloween movies  Mike Myers  oh the guy with the mask  right  the guy with the  William Schneider  yeah  oh yeah 
[00:49:00]  the fucking first one  was killer  amazing  yeah  second one was alright  yeah the second one  was alright too  but that first one  because the jokes  that were in there  the site gags  fucking hilarious  fucking loved it  does it hold up  yes I haven't seen it  in a while  the first one  yeah  it's one of those  things that you  spend enough time  because at first  everybody was quoting it  so everybody got tired  of it  it's like Napoleon Dynamite  right  you can go back now 
[00:49:30]  go back and  you can remember  how fucking hilarious  it was  how many people  realize that Napoleon  Dynamite has a whole  fucking scene  after the credits  yeah I know  an entire scene  of the brother  getting married  to the black chick  right  at the end  I mean after all  the fucking credits  and there isn't even  an indication  that there's gonna be  something after the credits  and if you don't  watch that at home  and forget  that it's on demand  and you're fucking  in the kitchen  or something  and all of a sudden  you hear stuff  you look over  and go  oh fuck  and it's like  a ten minute scene  it wasn't in the first 
[00:50:00]  limited theatrical run  really  and then when it  went national  oh you're right  could you take a picture  of me on my horse  he turns to look  all fucking  what he's singing  but I still love  technology  that he sings  always and forever  terrible  whatever happened  to that guy  we had him on right  yeah  yeah we had him on  when he was doing  another movie  yeah  and we had Pedro too  yeah  well we might have  had Pedro  yeah  might have been  his twin brother  that's very angry  at the whole Pedro  character  yeah  and his brother 
[00:50:30]  actually does press  for him  as a goof  so we don't know  if we officially  have Pedro on  yeah  I want to  go into the  onion field  yes  you bring up  a good point  that shit  after the credits  fuck that  just throw it  in the regular  movie  wait wait wait  because how many  times you're  walking out  and you're  in the crowded  aisle  and all of a sudden  oh what  and then everyone  has to turn around  you're trying to  find a seat  that's every  Marvel movie  now  I fucking hate that  just put it in  the regular  fucking movie  Dawn of the Dead  the Dawn of the Dead 
[00:51:00]  with Ving Rhames  and shit  right  the entire movie  the outcome of the movie  is based on  what's happening  kind of during the credits  but initially the credits start  and people start walking out  and then it's like  wait a minute  this is the end of the movie  they all fucking get killed  right  and then you gotta stand there  and watch the last few minutes  in the aisle  the Opie and Anthony podcast  does it  right  it's the nugget  it's the nugget  Opie it's the nugget  for the movie  no man  we're on to

[01:07:00]  it's a little too quirky for us  I don't think so  you like it  you just said that a minute ago  you know who loved it  no I don't like it  hipsters  everybody loves Arrested Development  hipsters love it  that's hipster shit  they put up a banana stand  by Radio City for a day  and there was a line  around the block all day long  I didn't understand that  I didn't get it  who did that  you didn't go to it  Arrested Development  I saw the pictures on Twitter  it's like a theme in the show  the blues  so in a banana stand  that's where the money is  there's always money  in the banana stand  why would you wait online  just because this banana stand  was in a TV show  who cares  it's fun  for who 
[01:07:30]  it's like the famous  fucking grapefruit  huh  it's like the famous grapefruit  you're right  yeah we did the grapefruit bit  if you took a grapefruit around  and toured it  and brought it to your cities  and put it on TV  and stuff  people would stand online  so they could get a picture  with the grapefruit  see the grapefruit  go oh my god  that's the grapefruit  we did it with a grapefruit  right at K-Rock  yeah  apple  that's right  it was an apple  because we watched it rot away  it was the famous apple  can we get another  rotting apple bit going  much like our K-Rock career 
[01:08:00]  just sat there  and rotted away  the apple had a dedicated  Paltaw cam  it did  right  I forgot all about that  so we would leave the cam on  when we'd leave the show  just so people could look  at the apple  that's the apple  can we do that again  can we bring that back  we're not allowed to have cameras  and can we make it a full podcast  next week  yeah  why not  what do we want to do  for next week's podcast  oh  I don't know  we should definitely set up  a live stream channel  that is just  the Opie and Anthony  famous apple 
[01:08:30]  yeah let's do it  would be good  we could just do it  in an office  it's easy enough  put it in the office  put a fucking camera on it  yeah  let's put an apple  in studio again  log in and see it  last thing  yeah  in a case  like a  I don't know  like a crystal decanter  maybe  we could use a crystal decanter  where would we get one of those  yeah  I'm so fucking mad at that  who's got an extra crystal decanter  lying around  I want a good one  I don't even drink 
[01:09:00]  he's a big fan on the show  and quite frankly  when that president  when that president arrived  I was feeling pretty damn good  about myself  yeah  I was feeling very special  for one lousy fucking day  yeah I guess we were wrong  to think that Paul Anka  wanted to be friends  with the ONA show  no kidding  no kidding  I take back making fun of him 
[01:09:30]  why  because he doesn't want to be friends  with the show  he's not lonely at all  he's just a publicist  and sending out  bullshit decanters  to everybody  yeah  I'm kind of glad  why  because I didn't really  want it in my house  so now I have a perfect excuse  to bring it in here  and give it to somebody  still Paul Anka though  well it's Paul Anka's people  Paul Anka doesn't even know  that went out  and Kevin Pollack understands  because you know  that was just a goof  that was sincere  that was a goof  so he knows that 
[01:10:00]  I'm not going to keep that  what  so that's good  no  that was very nice  he actually went  no it was a goof though  based on the Paul Anka thing  so he knows that  I'm not going to actually  keep his iced tea  he had to spill the beans on  it was the cheapest  Tiffany gift ever  I confused him  I got that text a while ago  and I didn't send it out  I didn't say anything  that was great  how much was it  I don't know  she told me  but I don't remember  can we go online  we didn't look up  the Kevin Pollack gift  I think it was a couple hundred bucks  yeah it was a couple hundred bucks  I'm worth about a thousand

[01:19:00]  the great  Eddie Money  today on the  Fox and Friends  Summer Concert Series  Summer Concert Series  sure  it's so embarrassing  that they try to  compete with the  today show  what they had  Lone Star last week  I know they had  last week  they had Lone Star  they got any money  this week  Lover Boy has to be  right around the  corner  they had Lover Boy  well I'm sure  they're coming back  Lover Boy was down  there and then  they came up here  and were on the  Sam Roberts  after show there  it was quite amazing  it was amazing 
[01:19:30]  memorable caller  right  to that program  nice pants  figgy  figgy  hey figgy  and then they were  like oh we kind of  want to do a new  song  well why don't we  do Working for the  Weekend  yeah how about we  do Working for the  Weekend  oh okay  new song from  Lover Boy  that's what we  want to hear  I don't think so  we had Eddie Money  perform  on this very show  he did what  half a song or  something  he did a  short version  of two tickets  is he doing  baby hold on to me 
[01:20:00]  I guess he was  singing and  Fox just cut him  off to go to  commercial  that's what they  do as soon as  the song starts  playing they go to  commercial  no they said  he's going to  start singing  at the top of  the hour  he was singing  they booked  bands just as  rejoiner music  yeah rejoiners  remember the day  we watched  Def Leppard  and they would  pan in and out  but you never  heard the song  yeah  oh  Jimmy  it ain't good  guys  no  you gotta pick  I do

[01:21:00]  a one  one  fucking  hate that  wait what  commercial  you hate  the Geico  ones  Geico  those are  hilarious  with the  thing  the Geico  no the ones  where the two  guys are on  the traveling  stage  saying  happier than  a bodybuilder  who's a  oh the hipsters  yeah  these guys are  fucking hilarious  they're great  they're great  happier than  I can get it  I can get it  and they're kind  of smiling  and looking at  each other  yeah look at  that  why do you 
[01:21:30]  like them  well I just  think it's  really funny  I like the  Dikembe Mutombo  ones  oh they're  really funny  I do  they could be  the best  no  I went to  a certain  website  last night  and they  don't like  that commercial  why  they do not  like that one  and they don't  like the new  one too  with the  football player  that stands  on the walkway  of the white  guy that's  trying to go  to work  right  and starts  talking about  how you  know  you turn  down the  opportunity  to train 
[01:22:00]  with the  big black  football player  right  they don't  like that  one either  on that  website  anything  on that  site  yes  the good  old days  you know  pre-1865  they really  are  they just  do not  like  and then  the big  cheerios  commercial  was very  outrageous  that actually  made mainstream  news  yeah  there's a  commercial  where  this white  woman  white  kind of a  mom looking  white woman  sitting at a 
[01:22:30]  table  with this  little girl  who's obviously  of mixed  race  and they're  discussing  cheerios  and the  little girl  is kind  of sassy  you know  shit like  that  and then  she calls  for her  husband  and they  go to him  he's laying  down on the  couch  and he is  a black  man  and apparently  the comments  section  on the website  that was showing  this commercial  on TV  on the website  yeah the  YouTube  comment section  they had to  eliminate the  comments because  they were getting  a lot of people  did not like 
[01:23:00]  this commercial  there's also a  white husband  and a black  wife  yeah and  there's an  Asian one  and a black  guy  they're doing  a lot of  mixed race  commercials  now  and some  people still  very intolerant  it feels weird  to see it  like not  it's not  offensive  but it feels  weird like  oh they're  just trying  to  but I guess  look there are  a lot of  couples like  that  you notice  it  yeah  I mean  that's not  an uncommon  thing  the comments  some of the  comments were  don't worry  he's going to  leave anyway 
[01:23:30]  and ditch  the wife  and kid  yeah  her white  genealogy  didn't come  through very  very well  which ones  did you leave  that kid  did you leave  one  no  I can't  leave messages  on certain  websites  and things  because of  this job  god damn  the man  it's not  because of  any moral  or ethical  things  it's because  yeah  prism  the prism  program  is watching  everything  I type  it couldn't  be a more 
[01:24:00]  innocent  commercial  yeah  maybe to you  half breed  you know  you relate  to the kid  fucking hair  they got the  same hair  she's an  adorable  little girl  she's got a  little fat  neck though  it looks like  when she gets  older she's  going to have  neck crust  between her  neck and  where her  shoulders start  she's going to  get neck crust  what kind of  dick actually  goes and leaves  comments on  a commercial  YouTube page  language  like who cares  it's insane  like the fact  that people 
[01:24:30]  would go and  comment  fucking  niggas  it's a  fucking  Cheerios  commercial  is that  what you  like who  cares  it starts  with Cheerios  commercials  where it  starts  Jimmy  but that's  where  you know  that's where  you lose  your argument  yeah it's  almost like  I understand  like guys  like you know  the guy who got  fired the EMS  guy he actually  came to my  stress factory  show and thanked  me for  supporting  thank us  for supporting  him  because he  was just  making jokes  but then  there's the  guys that  will actually  go to  these sites 
[01:25:00]  and say  stuff that  they would  never say  as themselves  and their  whole thing  is why  I don't  have a job  where I  could say  it as  myself  well neither  do we  they're like  you can say  whatever you  want  it's like  nah you know  what if I  went on as  Jim Norton  and said  fucking like  really horrible  shit like  why is she  with a nigger  I would be  I would  seriously  probably find  a way to  fucking fire  me  so don't act  like I have  a way where  I could do  it  but I wouldn't  do it as  some fucking  little faggot  who hides  behind a fake  name  so if you  think that's  why you have  to hide  behind a fake  name  you're fucking  kidding yourself  you're lying 
[01:25:30]  to yourself  you just want  to go on  and say  horrible shit  that you don't  have the  fucking moral  courage to say  because I can't  do that shit  either  so don't act  like I'm in a  business where I  can say whatever  I want because  I'm not  I can say  most of what I  want and I  have an easier  time than a cop  or a fireman  I know that  especially with  real political  points and  criticizing the  mayor or the  president  I can't agree  with you  wholeheartedly  with that one  Jimmy because I  do think there  are certain  times things  need to be  said but in  this environment  you can't say  them without  a horrid  consequence  so you have 
[01:26:00]  to do it  under a  pseudonym  but there's  I agree with  it to a  certain degree  because you  look at like  again a fireman  who has a  problem with  race in the  department  it's hard for  that guy to  go on and  go hey look  you know I'm  Joe Sherman  and I have a  problem with  race here because  I feel like  blacks are being  promoted over  whites or  there's an  Asian guy  that could cause  a big problem  for you with  your chief  I understand  there's a  difference between  pure racial  hatred and  making a valid  racial point  where you're  still going to  get flack from 
[01:26:30]  it prime  example there's  a woman that  was a 911  operator recently  fired for her  Facebook posts  they were  considered racist  against blacks  meanwhile it's  her experiences  that she was  commenting about  on Facebook  about having to  deal with black  people on the  phone and the  number of calls  that came in  that were a  very high  percentage of  black people  she found  them to be  sometimes  unintelligible  over the phone  very combative 
[01:27:00]  and she was  just talking  about that  she then said  something like  they act like  animals  and bam  fucking fired  and the  comments section  were all about  what an asshole  she was  meanwhile  she wasn't  saying anything  out of the realm  of her experiences  I know  and she used  her real name  and everything  and she gets  fucking fired  I got the  actual post  she says  black people  are outrageous  they are most  like they are  more like animals  they never know  how to act 
[01:27:30]  just loud  I guess she  used an n-word  here just loud  and always causing  problems  that was one of  her Facebook  messages  you sure she  used nigger  because I don't  think she did  well it says  expletive so  yeah I think  it's just loud  fuckers or loud  motherfuckers  fair enough  yeah yeah  so  the thing is  you know whose  fault all this  is it's the  public  because where  are all of  you fucking  people all  of you fucking  where are you  sticking up for  each other  where are you  posting supportive 
[01:28:00]  messages  like you know  I mean it's  like  you can't  there's a  there's too  much fear  no I don't  even mean with  that particular  I mean in  general for  people being  fired over  language or  expressing  themselves  Louis raised  a great point  when uh  like he said  when people are  offended because  when people come  together  when they're  offended  like when  there's a  special interest  group or  something like  that  they come  and they  protest  where are  all of the  protest emails  or protest  postings  from you  the public  to say 
[01:28:30]  hey we don't  want people's  speech or  thoughts  censored  it's what  used to be  called the  silent majority  it's more  most of the  people  but their  reaction  is a  non-reaction  but it  shouldn't be  taken so  lightly  it shouldn't  be confused  for apathy  people do  care  but they  don't care  enough  to rally  the troops  ok then you  know what  fuck them  I'm not saying  you have to go  out and start  a protest  but if I 
[01:29:00]  ever get in  trouble for  what I say  it may happen  I may say  something horrible  and get fired  from this job  I'll never go  wow I fucking  didn't practice  what I  I stick up  for fucking  everybody  exactly  yeah  and again  in my job  it's easier  to do that  and if it  comes and bites  it comes and  bites me  and a lot  of those  people will  not stick  up for me  and I  understand that  I know  they won't  or they'll  give some  bullshit  fucking  pussy boy  facebook comment  sorry you  got the  but you know  there's an  element of  fear out there  though  Jimmy  that can't 
[01:29:30]  be  understated  here  people are  afraid  to speak  they're afraid  to speak  their mind  they're afraid  to speak  about certain  political  affiliations  race issues  are the  big hot  button  there's another  thing going  on  with a  there was  this 911  operator  there was  something else  god I wish  I could remember  off the top  of my head  but it's  just people  are afraid  well that other  people should  you don't have  to go out  and go I  agree with  their blacks  are terrible  but where are  the people  supporting her 
[01:30:00]  and going  that what  she said  is fair  you know  what people  being afraid  is one thing  but you  could support  that type  of shitty  speech  and maintain  who you  are  I read  comments  where people  did support  it and the  string right  after the  support were  people calling  that person  a horrible  racist  but that's  part of the  public  they're part  of the  public too  those people  calling them  a racist  are part of  the public  and they're  part of the  fucking problem  because the  ones who were  turning on  people supporting  that speech  I think that  operator kind of 
[01:30:30]  sounds like a  cunt even if  that's her  experience  to post that  I should read  the other  post  and it's a  generalization  she says  I can count  on one hand  the black  people I know  who don't have  shit for brains  and she also  posted  I'm a very  easygoing person  and I will  give the shirt  off my back  to help  others  but when  call after  call are  black people  fighting and  screaming and  hitting each  other and they  want to yell  at me and  treat me like  shit  when I'm  trying to  help it's  not cool  I imagine  that is  frustrating  and then she  writes I  stand by  every word  I said  and do not 
[01:31:00]  apologize  she's not  apologizing  she was  fired  she still  didn't  apologize  yeah good  for her  I mean  yeah  that's a  sick  I'm sorry  to interrupt you  that's a  sickening thing  in this country  and when  Christine Whitman  was fucking  governor of  Jersey  and remember  that head  trooper  got in  trouble  he goes  well we  arrest  one of  black people  because they  commit more  of the  crime  he was  just saying  that's  fired  or he  got in  trouble  we teach  people to  speak  dishonestly  and we  never rush  to each  other's  aid  but if  there was  a massive  outcry  every time  somebody  was silenced  for a 
[01:31:30]  speech  that were  saying  things  that are  shitty  even  things  we  totally  disagree  with  it would  stop  happening  how about  people start  targeting  the advertisers  of companies  that buckle  to this  pressure  where the  fuck  are you  where are  you people  there's a  there's a  trend going  on in  advertising  now where  the white  person  especially the  white male  is portrayed  as the  idiot  and the  black  female  black  couple  is  are the  words of  wisdom  the  educators 
[01:32:00]  and it  permeates  the fucking  TV  I watch  it  and of  course  I think  I'm  sensitive  to it  so I  notice it  and I  just see  it as  horse shit  it doesn't  bother me  in that  what are they  portraying  people like  this  it bothers  me of  the intent  they're  kowtowing  and they're  trying to  present an  image  that I  don't think  is completely  accurate  they know  it's safe  they don't 
[01:32:30]  want to get  like oh  why aren't  you including  more  but they  don't get  accolades  either  there will  constantly be  this complaint  that we're  underrepresented  underrepresented  how does  12 or 13  percent of the  population  make up  at least  50 percent  of the  fucking  commercial  people I  see in  commercials  and TV  shows  it's  astounding  let's go  to Steve  Steve  yes  hi guys  I'm a  long time  friend of  the show  I'm a 
[01:33:00]  black person  and I think  I've argued  with you  a couple  of years  ago  you know  I used to  get angry  with some  of the  things that  you spew  out  I don't  say I  spew  and I  don't think  about it  you do  you really  don't  but right  now  I feel  sorry  for you  you are  paranoid  obviously  your views  on race  are very  anachronistic  no doubt  about it  what does  that word  mean  circus  none of  us know  what it is 
[01:33:30]  it basically  means that  they're old  fashioned  outdated  okay  and  outdated  huh  right  you really  don't have  to harp  on that  because  quite frankly  I believe  you make  everybody  around you  uncomfortable  really  including  yeah  including  your  your  your  your  co-stars  stars  I think  they  I think  if I may  speak  for them  for a second  I believe  whether it's  comfortable  uncomfortable 
[01:34:00]  or not  they know  me  they know  my  beliefs  and my  intent  when I  speak  about  stuff  on the  air  so I  don't  think  I'm  shocking  them  I don't  think  they're  sitting  here  squirming  in their  seat  and I  don't  think  anybody  looks  at them  and puts  my  beliefs  on them  we all  are  different  fucking  people  you  don't  agree  with  what  I'm  saying  doesn't  mean  I'm  spewing  when I'm  talking  I feel  that  people  like  Reverend  Al  spew  and  I  feel  a lot  of  black  leadership  is 
[01:34:30]  spewing  I  feel  that  people  that  use  the  race  card  are  spewing  you  don't  under  don't  undersell  what  I'm  saying  by  calling  it  spew  motherfucker  bullshit  I  use  the  fact  card  you  cocksucker  it's  the  fact  card  I  base  my  argument  I'm  not  fact  your  facts  are  very  simplistic  they're  facts  you  fucking  asshole  they are  facts  13%  of the  population 
[01:35:00]  50%  of the  prison  population  why  don't  blame  whitey  don't  blame  whitey  there  you go  what's  matter  reality  fucking  hurts  don't  it  what's  matter  you  can't  get  100%  of the  white  people  to  kowtow  to  you  there's  still  a few  of  us  left  there's  still  a few  of  us  left  there's  still  a few  of  us  left  now 
[01:35:30]  i'm  uncomfortable  yeah  i am  so  fucking  relevant  the  pendulum  is  swinging  back  the  other  way  no  didn't  happen  i look  at facts  and  figures  my  friend  facts  and  figures  i'm  a  textbook  guy  i've  been  a  textbook  guy 
[01:36:00]  my  whole  life  i  see  what  happens  i use  facts  not  this  idealistic  bullshit  that i see  in alarm  commercials  oh look  out the  white  criminal  his house  he's  home  invading  look at  the white  crook  shut  up  shut  up  viewers  who's  looking at  that radio  you freak  i'm 
[01:36:30]  not  listening  i'm  sorry  exactly  shut  up  everyone's  waking up  to your  schemes  everyone's  waking up  to your  schemes  hold on  see  bobby fisher  wasn't  finished  go ahead  bobby  come on  man  can i  address  something  steve  said  steve  can i  say  let jim  hold on 
[01:37:00]  steve  hold on  steve  as anthony's  co-worker  steve  as anthony's  co-star  because you're  raised  does he  make us  uncomfortable  in all  honesty  i don't  you know  and i  disagree  on some  things  we agree  on some  things  we don't  always agree  on this  stuff  but i  wouldn't say  it makes  me uncomfortable  because i  what  even the  stuff that  aunt says  that i  don't agree  with  i like  the fact  that at  least aunt  says things  whether i mean  again i'm not  saying agree or  disagree with  them but he  says things  and he's not  duplicitous about  it like that 
[01:37:30]  so it doesn't  make me necessarily  uncomfortable even  if i don't agree  with it because  like if you call  up and you say  let's like  like when  where farrakhan  will say things  that i don't  like um but  it doesn't make  me uncomfortable  because he's  saying things that  whatever he said  that's how he  feels that's what  he says and i  respect that more  than somebody  who hides  i'm the first  person that  will defend  free speech  i really respect  what you said  really good  spewing  people about  what you do  about you  i speak  i don't  spew  i'm speaking  right okay 
[01:38:00]  you speak  unsubstantiated  facts  unsubstantiated  i i quote  fbi crime  statistics  sir  fbi crime  stats  punch you in the  face when you  were a kid  no  no no one  does  but there is a  virtual holocaust  of black on white  crime going on  that is not  reported  a virtual holocaust  of black on white  crime that is not  being reported  sir 
[01:38:30]  black mob  violence  coming from  everybody knows  oh is that it  candy  candy crush  yeah what  oh okay  well as your co-star  i just don't get involved  i just know when you go down this road  it's an hour i don't have to worry about  that's true  people are laughing their ass up  at the sound  it comes out of nowhere  level 147 by the way  for the people keeping track at home  i know we have black listeners 
[01:39:00]  but that's not going to change  my opinions aren't going to change  based on the fact that there are black listeners  like it or lump it  like it or lump it  america lump it will leave it  no  millions want to hear it  millions  i really miss patrice  oh i know  so do i  that's so fucking stupid  and again  this is not to say  that you have a right to believe  and to think and say  what you  what you believe  that's cool 
[01:39:30]  the problem is  you don't want to  you don't want to  you don't want to realize  i like the show  i like some of the  of course you do  it's a fantastic program  i don't like the fact  that you constantly  talk about race  in such a backwards  stupid way  it's not backwards and stupid  it's it's a view  it's a view  it's a view that is barely allowed  is barely allowed to be spoken these days  it's a taboo subject  that people cower away from  not me  i don't hide behind your gun  i don't hide behind my gun 
[01:40:00]  go fuck your mother  you cock  fuck you  hide behind my gun  fuck you  get out of here  shut the fuck up  yeah  yeah  mostly illegal  mostly illegal guns  and you're killing  and by the way  you're killing each other with them  good job  good job  you're killing each other  with illegal guns  yes you are  look at those stats

[01:42:00]  to get  whatever's in your system out man  what's in my system  you're a little over the top  angry about the whole thing  what  i see  i see  i see things that affect  my country  and affect  um  the uh  the pursuit of life  liberty  and happiness  and i  it affects me  so why wouldn't i be able to speak out on that  why wouldn't i be able to speak out on the fact that  there is a disproportionate number  of black people in this country  that are  uh  being  um 
[01:42:30]  uh  out of control as far as violence goes  uh  that  that what  i said understandable  yeah  why  why wouldn't that upset me  yeah i understand that  as an american  why  why is it that we see inner cities  being fucking destroyed  destroyed  uh  with  with crime and gang violence  and i can't fucking talk about it  and say why is this happening  we're not saying you can't talk about it man  and that's what i do  i open and honestly talk about it 
[01:43:00]  i don't see what the fucking problem is  it  oh hold up  yeah  i'm trying to talk to you reasonably man  i know  well  what i understand is  i mean  now we've got to talk to you  it's just shot right off  and i'll let you  what happened  what's going on  you hear me  yeah yeah yeah  you hear me  hey  i did 27 years in the army man  uh huh  just like you do all  i'm not generalizing to the point where i say all black people  i say disproportionate number 
[01:43:30]  there's a problem that isn't being addressed  there is a problem  don't you want to say all though  i want to open  i think you do  but no  i think you do  no i i don't  that's where it scares you  beat beat you know something  it's very odd  but i do know some black people  i am friends with some black people  oh my god i have black people at my house  ah  but but i'll tell you one thing  i'm not gonna have  fucking gang members  that are the  the uh  reason that inner cities are being 
[01:44:00]  fucking destroyed  and no one wants to come out  and actually address the issue  of  of  17 to 20 people a weekend getting shot  6 being killed  in chicago  and no one addresses it  i know that  it's terrible  i was in the airport  so probably the same time you  was  i was trying to figure out  if you went to school together  airborne  oh  my brother was uh  82nd  yeah i was up in alaska  oh he was  no he was down in um  fort benning  that's where they send 
[01:44:30]  those people  jesus christ  all right guys  thank you  all right man  take it easy  all right  i have no problem  with black people  in general  i have a problem  with the fact that  white people  can't address  black issues  in this country  and when i i hear like  well you live in a nice neighborhood  it doesn't affect you  it does affect me  it does affect me  there is a giant  financial problem  that is uh  on the backs of this country 
[01:45:00]  and uh  a part of it is based on  um  the prison system  uh  the justice  the judicial system  and no one really wants  to talk about  the fact that there is  a  a minority  of people  carrying the majority  of the weight  of a problem  and why is that  why  do something  about it  pick yourself up  by your bootstraps  what's your solution  behave  huh 
[01:45:30]  what's your solution  uh  you know what  there is a solution  in open and honestly  at least speaking about it  exposing it  telling the king  that he is indeed nude  uh  instead of just  pretending  that everything's  hunky dory  and turning your back  right  to the uh  violence  and uh  animalistic behavior  uh  there is a giant problem  with uh  black on  on black  and black on white  crime  in this country 
[01:46:00]  yet  what it gets  what gets addressed  by the mainstream media  white on black crime  uh  which is  the minority  of the crime  that isn't  the big issue here  but any other  combination  you know  we're looking right now  at a trial  that's going on  the zimmerman trial  between a hispanic man  and a black man  that's what happened  uh  yet  they wanted it so bad  to be white  on black  even though it isn't  it's hispanic on black  it's getting such coverage 
[01:46:30]  meanwhile  the other way around  where it's a black  um  person  that took  the life  of a white person  regardless  if it's self-defense  or blatant murder  it doesn't get  the attention  well  why  the frust  frustrates me too  but it's the press  yes  and I'll tell you why  here's why  it is  I've said it before  it's the luxury  of the ruling class  not you and I  no no no no  blaming it  this is why the press  does it  because they see  white people 
[01:47:00]  as the ones  who are comfortable  and in charge  so they're safe  targets  that's why the press  does it  I can't stand it  it's almost like  they don't feel like  it's bullying  to mention the racial  angle of white on black  because they're white  which makes them feel  better and more comfortable  and like they're in charge  you know what I saw  last night  that was  oh  something happened  to the candy crush  you know I saw  last night  that was infuriating  also  there was  a county fair 
[01:47:30]  in Iowa  and  a gang of blacks  were walking around  saying it's  it's fucking  beat whitey night  they were literally  marching around  saying it's beat whitey night  and they were beating  the shit out of white people  there were 911 calls  that I was listening to  from people saying  there are mobs  of black people  beating up white people  police  were interviewed  saying yes  the people that were  injured were white people  the people that were  doing it were black people  the news 
[01:48:00]  the fucking news  that was reporting  this story  then  got perspective  on this  by talking to  a former skinhead  they spoke with  a skinhead  who had to then  talk about how  he would beat people  based on the color  of their skin  and how this isn't  the answer  it was their way  to inject  look  they're not alone  white people do it too  stop it  but that's got nothing  to do with the blacks  doing it  that's what  that's  that's 
[01:48:30]  that fucking  soul sickness  that the press has  that is based  on feeling  superior  and feeling  better than  the press doesn't do that  because they feel like  black people are better  than us  if they are  we've talked about  parents  that's how they see  themselves  so it's  it's a fucking  it's just a sick way  of looking at it  all these things  contribute to  the problem  and the issue here  that never gets addressed  and they never will address it 
[01:49:00]  no  they never will  no  they're never going to address  why they do it  so I guess this will just  continue  forever  it's only fair to take a call  that agrees with you  oh really  yeah we like to balance  this shit out  fair and balanced  Tom in Virginia  Tom  that ain't no Tom  it's Fontaine  what's up buddy  oh Fontaine  we know you  it says Tom  on the line  Tom I shall be  hey um  as an assimilated  black man  I would have to say  that 
[01:49:30]  I agree with Ant  I mean I really  really do  I see Anthony  as like a beer glass  full and it's  troughing over the top  if you take a knife  and sweep that shit  off the top  it's mostly beer  and I can't see  that he's saying  anything wrong  he's just a fucking  maniac and yells at people  I like the um  I like the analogy  you'll lose your argument  when you scream  and yell at the guy  I like a good beer  should use your intelligence  well you know what  when the guy  wouldn't stop  I'm a person  that lives the life  that Anthony dreams  I mean he'll never  like me  Anthony won't like me  but you know what 
[01:50:00]  I grew up in Harlem  New York  I lived in zip code  10035  I live in Virginia now  I have a good job  I paid attention  in school  thank god  see I have no  problem with you  you could sit in my  jacuzzi anytime sir  uh no  I'd date white girls  oh see there's  the problem now  he had to throw that  in didn't he  good for you  I better hang up on him  he probably dates  white girls  because he enjoys  their company  Paul in the Bronx  yeah I'm a white guy 
[01:50:30]  and I have facts too  and I can yell  just as loud as you  Anthony  there's no way  that Opie's gonna  reach level 168  cause he's leaving  a disproportionate  amount of  accommodations  I like this guy  look the fact is  I just don't have  the same passion  for that topic  I'm sorry  yeah  I understand  to a point  but I don't go home 
[01:51:00]  and search out this shit  I don't  someone in this room  might go home  and search out  some of this stuff  I don't expect people  to really bring  their anger up  no it's not  I like staying educated  on the topic  of race  in this country  I think  it is  extremely one sided  that's what we see  in mainstream media  that's what we see  in social media  if you look on  the major  social media  Twitter and Facebook  what you'll see  is this  just  false 
[01:51:30]  sense  of  happiness  when it comes  to diversity  and what not  and there's never  any negative  if there is  the people are just  called out as being racist  I like  staying educated  and  so why don't we  bring to the table  positive black stories  well that's what you see  all the time  you do  you know  that's  that's what's out there  all the time  they hide all the negativity 
[01:52:00]  the part I really agree  with you on  is the press  the press is terrible  well they're hateable  they are fucking  for many many reasons  repulsive  if you knew  some of the  the crimes  that have been  perpetrated  purely on the name  of race  black against white  crimes  based on nothing  but race  the amount  of heinous  violence  murder  fucking  mutilation  of people  that gets  zero coverage  zero  and if you search  things out on the internet  then you're considered  a racist 
[01:52:30]  because you wanted to  actually know  the statistics  know what happens  out there  so with people  that don't know  about these things  because it's so well  hidden  they look at me  and call me paranoid  well the press  has also gotten  their fuck  I'm sorry  they've also been  embarrassed a couple times  wrongly covering  the black guy did it  thing  like in Boston  and Susan Smith  and there was another one  recently  and they went with it  and then they got  they look stupid  so now they're just  too embarrassed  and too gun shy  to cover that  because they've looked  bad covering it 
[01:53:00]  and they've been made  fools out of covering it  if you look bad  because three or four times  in the history  of the world  you've bought the story  of somebody  that claimed  that a black person  did something  when they indeed didn't  it's silly  why would you use  those four instances  to base your entire  they make mistakes  on everything  they jump the gun  on a shitload of stories  and get them wrong  there's a motive behind it  and I don't know  what the motive is exactly  I mean we've tried  to figure it out  but there really is  a motive behind it  which they don't say 
[01:53:30]  it has been made  nearly impossible  to criticize  a black person  especially a successful  black person  without being called  a racist  just the other day  that shithead  that said that  criticizing the  Internal Revenue Service  based on this scandal  is another way  of saying nigger  it's another way  of undermining  a black president  I mean that is ridiculous  yet he won't  lose his job  people spoke about it  but it's gone now 
[01:54:00]  it's fucking gone  so  what the  that's why I'll keep  fucking yapping  about this shit  because it just seems  that the mainstream  media doesn't want  to cover it  what happens is  half the anger  is like directed  at the people  doing this stuff  but shitty things  are happening  treacherous things  happen  and then it gets  mixed in with the  anger at the press  if the press  covered it accurately  so much irritation  I feel over it  would be gone  because you figure  people are just  garbage  but they count  out organizations 
[01:54:30]  that say  well we don't  like that you're  they used to cover  it but then they  would say  oh my god  you're showing  so many black  criminals on the  news  and then they'll  say they said  shit like  well that's what  we're getting here  we're covering  robberies and  things like that  but then they  stopped covering it  because it came  off as being  racist  you're ruining  donut day  what happened  oh fuck  you really are  you know what  I'm going to  have a chocolate  donut  just to show  I have tolerance 
[01:55:00]  wow  you can be watching  Anthony taking  two bites  and then fucking  grabbing his chest  and falling on the  floor  how is that  my body's rejecting  it  a lot of phone  calls  we don't have time  to get to the phone  calls but  a lot of kids  toys and diapers  are all multiracial  not enough  people speak  honestly  like Anthony  does  black people  make it  racist  when it's not  that's true  sometimes  there was a series  of Washington  mutual ads  with white  and black  bankers  that's nice  agrees with  Anthony 
[01:55:30]  this caller  is a dumbass  the media  is not reporting  it because  no one wants  to get in  trouble  that's true  my favorite  part of the  show is when  Anthony put  truth on  national broadcasting  agrees with  where it is  coming from  my experiences  are the same  there you go  alright  P-Rock have we  hit on this  subject before  no this is a  first  if anyone knows  how to get past  147 please let  me know  what's 147 is that  the one with the 
[01:56:00]  chocolate comes out  of the sides  or the vines  it's brutal  I don't know  it's just all  sorts of shit's  going on  time bombs  time bombs  time bombs  blow  you don't even  know  I don't know  I haven't  played the  game  well you're  a time bomb  but I mean  we're talking  about time bombs  in the candy  crush game  I think Anthony's  addicted to  anger  no  no I don't  like being  angry  no you don't  like nobody  I believe  he doesn't  like it  no you  search it  out though  man  no  yeah  it's an  addictive  drug  is it  oh my god  yeah  that's why  fuck yes 
[01:56:30]  but I don't  get angry  at anything  but this  subject  but that's  what confuses  me about  you because  you get  over the top  angry and  you search  this is coming  from someone  that used  to be a  very angry  person  and you  have an  incredible  intelligence  but then  you get  really fucking  over the top  angry  oh because  I don't  we don't  know what  the root  of that  is  it's just  a passion  for um  you know  yeah but you  got passion  for a lot  of things  I'm finally  talking here  thank god  oh 
[01:57:00]  you have  passion for  a lot  of things  but this  is one  of those  topics  where it's  it's really  creepy how  angry you  get  because  and I  know your  experience  growing up  you didn't  have anything  really bad  happen to you  by the black  race  no  because a lot  of times  that's where  this stems  from  right  but you  have never  come up  with an  incident  where it  explains  everything  no except  for the guy  that would  shake me  down for  50 cent  right  give me  50 cent  but a  Mexican  tried to  fuck you  well  you really  should hate  Mexicans  yeah  I try to 
[01:57:30]  sink you  to the  black people  my dad  got him  that's for  sure  you don't  hate gay  people  I'm not even  saying you're  wrong it's just  the level you  take it to is  kind of creepy  no it's  it's because  it  and I've never  been able to  understand this  it's very  it affects  everybody  it affects  were you brought  up in a very  racist household  no actually I  goof about it  and stuff but it  wasn't you know  my mother used  to say you know  when I'd ask her  hey could you  get me that  or something  she'd be like  what do I look  three shades 
[01:58:00]  darker than you  you know things  like that  innocent fun  things  you know the  Brazil nuts  were called  nigger toes  at grandma's  house  things like  that  you know if  I fucking  got ten dollars  in my birthday  card and I  wanted to go to  the store to  buy something  my mother would  say I'm acting  like I'm  nigger rich  say things like  that  so yeah you  know but it  was all just  you know  and are you  trying to make  society better  or your life  better because  your life  you don't have  to deal with  any of this  shit  I could  absolutely turn  a blind eye  to all this  and it 
[01:58:30]  wouldn't affect  me  one iota  as they say  at all  I understand  shit's going  on out there  but there is  a when you  see this  dishonesty  going on  this this  bullshit that  is just  fucking sitting  there in  plain view  with no one  wanting to  address it  that shit  pisses me off  but it's the  same thing that  I joke about  Bobby Fisher  but it's  it's a  brilliant guy  oh  really truly  brilliant guy  and when you  get  and I am  oh jeez 
[01:59:00]  you're a  sweetheart  oh that's  just as good  no but I'm  you know  Anthony  we look at  Anthony  me and Opie  sometimes look at  him when he  talks about  stuff science  and shit  like that  that we  really just  can't  it's the  amount of  things that  you know  and what  happens sometimes  is when a  brilliant mind  focuses on  something  but no I'm  serious it's  like it's  what undid  Bobby Fisher  because he  was so  fucking smart  that a  brilliant guy  can justify  anything  like because  with the gift 
[01:59:30]  of arguing  and the gift  of debating  it's almost  like even  because of  course Bobby  Fisher made  certain points  that were  correct  and then it's  very hard  with somebody  that's smart  to pick apart  where the line  of what's  correct and  what has just  become a manic  anger is  because you know  what I mean  again and I'm  not shitting on  but that  brilliant sometimes  hurts  because when  you focus on  something  that fucking  mind gets  going man  and that  same mind  that can  fucking 
[02:00:00]  make a  barometer  or that  can fucking  recall information  from 1971  oh yeah I was  taking a shit  and I heard a  commercial while  Barney Miller  was on  and has that  perfect recall  when that  mind focuses  on something  it's very  hard to  turn it  because that  mind is very  very powerful  I need a  lobotomy  no just  you just  you know  you get really  angry  yeah that's  part of it  though  and that's  what happened  to Bobby  like over  the top  angry  yeah  yeah  Iraq coming  well your 
[02:00:30]  anger has  launched two  hit songs  well that's  true  Drew Boogie  loves taking  those and  twisting them  around doesn't  he  Jim in  Jersey  Jim  yes  Sophie how  are you  today  I'm good  sir  alright  before you  start yelling  at me  let me just  say what I  gotta say  alright  so anyways  listen  as far as  I'm concerned  I agree  with you  100%  the only  problem  I think  where you  get lost  here is  that when  you have  a spoiled  kid  who do 
[02:01:00]  you blame  you blame  the parents  so blaming  black society  really isn't  going to get  your argument  across the  right way  it's the  media  it's the  people who  can handle  to them  the people  who just  you know  they spoil  them  that's what's  happening  there  you know  it's just  it's human  you let  people get  away with  stuff  they're just  going to  continue  getting away  with it  so the only  people who are  going to be able  to put a handle  on this  is the cops  the police chief  the mayor  but it's not  going to happen  we're going to be  abused 
[02:01:30]  and it's going to  happen until  listen  until there's  maybe a race  war  but here's  really the reason  for the call  the funny part  is how  Opie  is quiet  during this  whole tirade  except when  it comes to  the point  where somebody's  talking about  a kid  and he gets  a chance  to talk about  it's not  those kids  and then he  perks right up  and oh my god  Opie barely  talks about  his kids  and when he does  it's a story  that like has  significance  Jim nice try 
[02:02:00]  thank you  the fact is  I barely talk  about my kids  Jim so your  point and I  didn't hang up  on him he just  hung up on him  I pick and choose  and I bring a  little kid shit  to the show  I get that would  be very fucking  boring if it was  a regular thing  and it's usually  a story that  involves like you  and your kid  I mean classic  the fucking  elevator story  with the kid  that's not  you know let me  tell you what  little Johnny did  today  if you don't 
[02:02:30]  like kid stories  so be it  fine I don't  give a fuck  I know for a  fact that you  know there's way  more people that  enjoy when I  talk about my  kids from time  to time than  don't so  and that's all  you worry about  when you do a  radio show  yeah  you know  yeah  there's a shitload  of people that  didn't like what  you were just  you know  this segment  so exactly  but probably more  did enjoy it  and that's how  this shit works  you just like  hearing a hothead  and to be honest  I mean I hate  tearing down a wall  especially right after 
[02:03:00]  it when I'm  yelling like that  it's obviously  I'm on the radio  you know  you're pushing  a little bit  has anyone  honestly  in regular life  seen me  at my home  yelling like that  no comment  I used to drive  in with you  no comment  no  no comment  oh I used to be  crazy on the road  with road rage  I've pretty much  lost the road rage  part  I don't get crazy  anymore  but it is tough  to get away  anger's hard man  for me  it's not necessarily 
[02:03:30]  race  but the press  coverage of race  drives me as nuts  as it drives  Ant  or speech stuff  drives me  it's so hard  to be  this is why  Louis is smart  and Colin is smart  because Colin  addressed a lot  of this stuff  in his one man show  but he doesn't  let the anger  block him  and I'm like  that's why  he's so fucking  brilliant  because Colin  feels the same way  about a lot of stuff  he's smart enough  to see it  but he's good enough  to perform it  without the anger  blocking it  and I watch him  and I'm like  he 
[02:04:00]  you know where he stands  but he really did  paint both sides  brilliantly  so you understand  that he gets both sides  so he's hard to combat  like  I admire him so much  and Louis will talk about  you watch Louis  when he talks about stuff  when someone criticizes him  well they have the right  not to be offended  it's like you logical cunt  but he just doesn't allow it  to affect his creativity  and that's why he's so fucking great  I admire that in those guys man  that ability to be smart enough  to see it  and let your creativity 
[02:04:30]  come over the anger  dude anger's a poison  it's very hard  I had to fucking learn that  it's really hard  I finally just let go  it got exhausting  to be fucking angry all the time  cause nobody  now it just comes out  every once in a while  I don't  I don't  I know  that's why I laugh  when people think  I'm still the angry one  I'm not  the angry man  really not anymore  people listen more  when you don't yell  like I've not  people you debate  they listen more  I had to learn the hard way  they take you more seriously  if you fucking have a discussion  instead of  when you have a point  and you yell and scream 
[02:05:00]  your point at someone  they're not listening anymore  cause all they're thinking is  what a fucking asshole  this guy is  so even though you had  a good point  it doesn't matter anymore  yeah  so  it's hard not to yell  I wish I knew that  fucking lesson years ago  many many years ago  yeah  I yelled and screamed  at so many fucking people  and I knew I was right  at the time  but it didn't matter  because they just looked at  me as a lunatic  it's almost like  we all think we're gonna find  the one magic phrase  that convinces everybody  oh yeah 
[02:05:30]  but it's a frustrating  like  I'm gonna hit the one thing  right  where everybody goes  oh  never  that's it  and it's hard to keep in mind  that the person I'm talking to  is being as sincere  about what they think  as I am  yeah  and  I can't comprehend  maybe that's narcissism  on my part  sometimes it's hard for me  to comprehend  that they can't see it  my way  how are you not seeing  my beautiful point  yeah  and the people who are good at that  can understand why somebody else  doesn't see that  it's really hard though 
[02:06:00]  it's very difficult  it's a fucking drug  yeah  yeah  alright  I got a great kid story  after the break  cool  me too  my mother came and grabbed the duvet  and I was holding  this is 300 pounds of misery 
[02:06:30]  my mum right  she's bending right back  and then I had one choice  because I was naked  it was the middle of the day  fucking 110 degrees  of Australian heat  like in your measurement  right  I'm sitting under my bed  having a wake  my mum walks in the room  I throw the magazine  down the side of the bed  in one motion  and she goes  clean this fucking room up  and she goes  why are you laying in your bed  I'm just  having a nap  you know  and she just goes  well get up now  and she goes  why are you getting up 
[02:07:00]  I said  well get up  can you get the fuck out  she starts pulling on my duvet  my erection strengthens  no she  she's pulling on my duvet  I'm panicking  like oh fuck  and I'm going  please mum  please mum no  and I had to make a decision  right  she's a big woman  I had to make a decision  I let go of the duvet  she goes flying backwards  into the cupboard  and I flip onto my stomach  as quick as possible  yeah  so I've still got this sweaty  fucking bald ass  sticking up  and a 300 pound mum

[02:10:00]  what  bad news  uh oh  barbecue day is  uh  canceled  now  we still have donut day  oh no  the listeners are gonna be so bummed  we don't get to enjoy barbecue food  what happened  I know  very bad news  hate to break it to the listeners  but uh  barbecue day  I believe has officially been canceled  what happened  I don't know  we don't know  this story is so  fucked up  uh  we've heard different  stories as to what happened 
[02:10:30]  what have you heard  I don't know  Troy Kwan's involved  uh  Roland is involved  let's get to the bottom of this  Travis  there's different stories  I bet you there's a person in this room  that knows exactly what's happening  oh exactly  Sam  the little fucking  guy that loves getting his nose in everything  I'm gonna go out on a limb  and I'm gonna say  somebody knows  everything that's going on  during the last break  oh and Travis is in on this  and Troy is coming  during the last break  I got spoken to 
[02:11:00]  more about barbecue  than I ever have been in my life  and I didn't even know  any of this was going on  but apparently  there is no barbecue coming  we thought it was coming  and Roland's been talking about  the four pit masters  all week long  and one of them  has been tweeting the hell out of us  oh yeah  three or four days  one of them is on their way  oh no  what  one minute Troy is telling me  barbecue is cancelled  yeah  then I come back in here  and Travis is saying  it's not cancelled  they both have different stories  and I was just talking to Travis  trying to figure out 
[02:11:30]  what exactly was happening  different stories as to why  it's cancelled  wait  Ubon's BBQ on Twitter  Ubon's  says  Opie Anthony Jim  feel better  are we involved  with cancellation  did they say  we were  the tweet says  the tweet says  feel better  said we had to cancel today  but I  but trying to reschedule  we know you'll love  our barbecue  and bloodies  why are they saying  feel better  maybe  are we being used  as an excuse  Iraq what's that  at 741  I got a message 
[02:12:00]  from him  saying he was  going home  all the pit masters  had to bail  and that's  from Roland  from Roland  saying he was going home  yeah I was told  that they  that they cancelled  on us  because it was raining  yeah  so pit  what's a pit master  it's like a master barbecue  like a pit  where you barbecue in  you know  you can turn over  the burgers  why'd they all have to cancel  what makes you a pit master  I know right  why does he feel better  somebody that just  runs up to people  and smells their armpits  I'm the pit master  alright  just read that exchange 
[02:12:30]  yeah  you read that exchange  I'm not reading  what do you got  what are you  a peach pit or something  is Roland still here  Roland's downstairs  waiting for the guy  what guy  I thought it was cancelled  I thought barbecue day  was cancelled  Daniel Vaughn  so one guy's coming  yeah  the Bourdain book  he has food  Roland's texting me right now  the Bourdain book  oh this big giant book  we got today  so what  where are the  just one guy  let me know  do you guys want him or not  what  what are we going to talk about  I mean if you can have a barbecue  I'll eat the barbecue 
[02:13:00]  I'll bring food for everybody  he'll just say  where are you from  and he'll be like  I'm from blah blah blah  and then that's it  yeah we do a good job  we keep a clean kitchen  Roland told me they cancelled  because it was raining  and then he texted me  saying one is on his way  this was after he told me  he was going home  because he was sick  and then he said  I'm glad I cancelled the rest  I said I thought they cancelled  because it was raining  and he said all did but one  which just doesn't make any sense  the rest  he told me they cancelled  he cancelled everybody 
[02:13:30]  he said he cancelled  yes  why would he cancel everybody  you'd have to ask him  I don't know  I was under the impression  that they all cancelled  who's brave enough  to ask him though  you guys  you don't know  what answer you're going to get  no kidding  Roland's going to be pissed  he's still kind of mad  at the Vince Vaughn phone situation  from yesterday  yeah but it's nothing  that we didn't say  you know what  I like Vince Vaughn's fine  but you know what  he's going to call in  on a one star movie 
[02:14:00]  he would never come in  I'm tired of these fucking people  none of them want to come in  they'll look like radio  like we're saying  hey look  here's a hunk of shit  on a fucking Pepper's Farm White  you want to eat it  right  and then when they know  they have a hunk of shit project  then they'll join  the hunk of shit media  right  because they want to  and it matches up all nice for them  well they want to get it out there  before word of mouth  but then Vince Vaughn turns around  and does a really good movie  three four star movie  we're not going to hear from them  yeah  we only get these fucking  big ass stars  when their project sucks  the movie's getting killed 
[02:14:30]  I was complaining before  that we have no women in here  like we always have  we have food things coming in  I wonder if that's why  you cancel people  what?  huh?  you mean on the air  or during the radio?  oh my god  maybe it was like  fine fuck it  you think he blew up?  no I think that was a big deal  no I don't think so  you think he blew up  canceled and said  I'm going home  no I hope not  Iraq's shaking his head yes  or he's chewing  Iraq what's going on?  chewing his cud  I'm hearing bits  everyone's got a different story  but I think that might be  you think  alright alright  because we were goofing on it 
[02:15:00]  we were kind of like  oh wait till the listeners  hear our barbecue  did you talk to them off the air?  no  because mine's  my message said that they bail  why would I?  and Travis's said they canceled  yeah I was hoping they canceled  do you think  that Roland might have been insulted  by some of the stuff  that was said on the air  went alright really?  really?  you don't like that?  fuck this  don't show  I'm going home  you can't do that though  here you go  that might not be it  they might have canceled 
[02:15:30]  but you can't just cancel a segment  yeah  we're teasing it  yeah  I don't know  where is it?  he's downstairs  waiting for one of the pitmasters  oh boy  it could have been  he could have lost it when  it's like  alright barbecue  Jim was going  okay barbecue  but Jim then said  why don't we have a girl in here  to talk to  we haven't had a girl in a long time  and then you dissed the books  when it came in  I didn't diss the book  you said  you were kind of like  I don't want that  no I mean off the air though  except I don't cook  that's  that's sort of what I say 
[02:16:00]  he gets very angry  this is all coming together now  I think we're right here  no I didn't show  Roland is very  very pissed off right now  you're bad  what am I going to look at  I'm not saying this is a bad book  it's a 90 pound cookbook  I don't cook  it's really a big book  what am I going to do with this?  wow  I'll smell it  but you told Roland  it smells nice  everything  everything about rib day  I'm not saying you're not  I'm not saying you're being honest  everything about barbecue day  has been looked at  and poo-pooed on  and I think Roland 
[02:16:30]  had finally just snapped  and had it  because that's how Roland gets  yeah but the bottom line  is the barbecue day  if a segment got a yes  it got a yes  that says something  but he doesn't stick  to his guns  you know Roland  sometimes he gets a little upset  is he on his way up?  apparently  he said the guy is soaked  so I assume he is looking  at the guy  alright someone look down the hall  so let's get Roland alone  before the guy comes in  for a second  oh boy  let's ask him for a second  go get Roland  oh boy  well I don't know  if he's up here yet  the guy's made  I think we got an angry panda situation  oh my god 
[02:17:00]  Giselle's gonna go get him  brace yourself  I'm serious  I think we got an angry panda situation  this could be bad  yeah because he walked by me  he didn't say anything before  so he's pretty mad at me  I guarantee  because the book was after  it was during the break  but dude what am I gonna do with that  it was Jim saying on the air  who cares about barbecue  when was the last time  we had a girl in  and then the book on top of that  then the book on top of it  it's adding up  before that  us talking about the fact  that the listeners  are gonna be like  oh they're gonna be so happy  to hear us eating  like the whole thing  has been shit on 
[02:17:30]  yes it has been  it's been made fun of  I would certainly eat barbecue  if it came  but we haven't had a chicken in a while  and that's partially our fault  but you know how  Roland doesn't say no to girls  we don't ask for them  huh  I just thought they cancelled  that's what I was told  oh boy  you're understandably stupid  it's funny  but you know how Roland can get  he gets very emotional  he's swinging his  who's nervous  raise your hand if you're nervous  he's walking head down  raise your hand if you're nervous  I'm nervous  I'm very nervous  I'm nervous  he's swinging his ID 
[02:18:00]  and walking with his head down  very quickly  he's walking  where's the guy  he's coming in  you said you wanted  yeah yeah  but where is the guy  Rolando  Roland  yeah he's on his way up  Roland step up  what's going on today  we're very confused  that barbecue day  almost was cancelled  yeah I wasn't sure  if you guys were into it  and to the pitmasters  we're just like  it's raining  and that  you weren't sure  if we were into it  yeah  we were kind of into it  we're into it  we're just kind of  we like the 
[02:18:30]  we like the Friday theme shows  yeah  the two of the pitmasters  it's raining  or we're watching the smoke  is it okay  yeah just stay  oh two of them  two of them actually said no  well no they want  they're bringing up food on Monday  but during the rain  the temperature changes  while they cook meat  and you can't  you know  only a pitmaster would know that  yeah  so the guy's here  but he doesn't have meat  no no  the one here has meat  he woke up like at five in the morning  to get his done  oh  oh  that's nice  the other one just started there  the pitmasters  they had to do  Good Morning America 
[02:19:00]  so the other guy  at his pit  didn't throw down  the slab of meat  so they basically just cancelled  on us  because we're radio  no  no  he didn't cancel  on your radio  just the smoke  it wasn't ready  are you mad that we didn't  receive the book  no  properly  no  I'm just not a cured meat guy  a little mad at the fact  that we were talking about  we'd rather have girls  than barbecue  well if you want girls  I mean  you can bring girls  yeah  all we gotta do  that's mostly our fault  we don't ask for them  well that's true  it's not like Roland said  no girls  you're getting barbecue  yeah  he didn't make that decision  that would be a quay thing to do 
[02:19:30]  you alright  it'd be a hell of a queeb  yeah  barbecue  eating that barbecue  we all get tits  something's going on  with you  the last couple days  what's up  something's up  I know  I see it in your eyes  what's up  I know  you're a little different  the last two days  really  is this all about  Vince Vaughn  and how that was  a screw up  that we couldn't help  yesterday  yeah  just  stress day 
[02:20:00]  to clean it up  sort of  clean it up  and  Stephen King's here  later today  it's 3 o'clock  fuck Stephen King  he doesn't like us  I don't know about that  I think he would love it  if he came in here  he doesn't do any interviews  before noon  that's why he had to wait  until  oh  he's coming at like  3 or something  doing some of the job  and I'm doing interviews  before noon  and T-Bone Burnett  T-Bone  who's that  T-Bone  T-Bone  T-Bone  who's that  it's a  he's a Grammy winner  oh okay  because of him

[02:24:30]  Roland's not cracking a smile  Roland what's up  oh Roland  let's get this out  Roland  what's going on  what's going on  we're only as sick as our secrets  oh  that's not good  is it Wednesday already  he did cocaine  I see it in your eyes  just get it out  it was just a long day yesterday  cleaning up that mess  oh that mess  that mess by the way  was the Vince Vaughn mess  yeah  but it was literally  legitimately  a technical difficulty  if we looked down 
[02:25:00]  and saw that  he was on there  we would have taken a call  it wasn't like  a thing  it was  it was a technical glitch  we didn't know  until  we were expecting a call  that the phones didn't work  because of Mars  we just thought  because of Mars  I wouldn't fuck with Vince Vaughn  because I actually wanted to ask  about Steve Byrne  because they're best friends  right yeah  and we couldn't  because of Mars  I know  that's I told them to  and what did they say  that was Mars  they have to understand  we're never getting  anybody from there  no no no  they're fine  because I said  the engineering here  sucks  because of Mars  are you annoyed 
[02:25:30]  about the engineering  Mars in particular  they were  yeah  they said  do you hire competent people  like that's not my job  to hire  so he doesn't get barbecue  no barbecue for him  you guys okay  you and Mars  oh yeah  no turkeys  you alright with this Mars  yeah we're fine  I told  Roland the truth  there's only one person  that fucked up the phones yesterday  and that was who  that was the star of the show  Mr. Opie  whoa 
[02:26:00]  what the fuck  oh no  where the fuck  did that come from  where did that come from  oh no  Roland you don't believe that  do you  oh no  there's only one way  those phones got fucked up yesterday  dude I was  oh shit  what was I supposed to do  just click away  you push buttons  and things will happen  oh wow  he's clicking away  he's fucking gay  how dare you talk about  the NBA finals with me  this morning 
[02:26:30]  knowing you had that  wow  in your back pocket  under the bus  you're pushing buttons  what buttons was I putting  he's pretty much  saying you're like a kid  with one of those  little Fisher Price things  you son of a  you're fiddling  you're putting a block  in the round hole  what did he do  what button did he hit wrong  what did I do  what did he do  what happens is if  I can show you  demonstrate  so Roland is mad at me  yeah  I can show you right here  did he tell you this  before right now  he told me yesterday  and then he went  dude yesterday  Mars told Roland 
[02:27:00]  that you were the guy  that fucked it up  and Roland's believing it  he's been sitting on this  now for 24 hours  and he's believing it  steaming  that's the biggest problem  was it accidental  obviously it was accidental  let's see  let's see Mars  what did I do  you picked choose server  I didn't pick choose server  you picked choose server  then you have this here  and if I go and put  if I throw something  on the keyboard there  uh huh  and make a  I don't know  a hash mark  whatever  uh huh  one little character  can be off  then that's it  oh my god  I did not do any  you fucked the server up  I didn't do any of this  you did that  to the server  I didn't do any of this  are you crazy 
[02:27:30]  you're a crazy person  I do remember seeing  that prompt come up  though  before uh  during yesterday's show  you're a crazy person  I just figured I'd jump  on the bandwagon  Mars is crazy  that was server follies  was the new game  on the Opie and Anthony show  server follies  I don't even know  what you did  I have to choose  I didn't choose server  did you do it intentionally  you probably didn't accidentally  you threw something  on the keyboard  oh my god  wow  I hear  I saw that prompt  come up right before  Opie said  lean over  fuck Vince Vaughn  oh wait a minute  you think I touched 
[02:28:00]  I haven't touched  this keyboard  in four years  I don't even know  what this does  did you put something  did you throw something  you're trying to tell me  I touched that keyboard  are you crazy  not with your fingers  did you throw anything  I touched this keyboard  I remember you throwing  your pen over there  right before you said  fuck Vince Vaughn  and the prompt came up  did you throw anything  over there  Mars is desperate  he is squirming out of this  you're trying to tell me  that I hit something  on these keyboards 
[02:28:30]  something happened  to that keyboard  I saw this on first 48  there was a Spanish guy  who killed someone  but then he's selling out  his fucking friend  I saw the same scenario  I didn't even know  those keyboards existed  I would never touch  those keyboards  sure you wouldn't  except for that one button  yep  one button is very clean  you want me to touch  the keyboard  oh no  oh no  oh no  do you want me to touch  the keyboard  if you're accusing me  of touching the keyboard 
[02:29:00]  I'm going to have  to touch the keyboard  oh no  can you touch it  see if it does  knock off the calls  we can test it  yeah  what would I have  what strange thing  would I have to  have done  maybe a book  or a CD  no I didn't  I don't throw stuff anymore  hit that button  where the prompt comes up  go ahead  just hit it  where the prompt comes up  well according to Mars  I knew exactly what to do  oh no you might have  accidentally just didn't  done that  no I would never hit  I would never click on server  I don't even know  what that means  click that  click that  I would never get 
[02:29:30]  to that point  hold on  no that's the wrong keyboard  which one  oh  you can't even do it  if we're aiming  that one  no  I didn't see anything happen  nothing happened  this appears to be  an engineering issue  Mars is panicking  because Mars is basically  there you go  oh shit  look  now  now what  now you have to hit connect  yeah  try to connect  you would have had to hit  50 buttons Opie  yeah exactly  no  yeah  oh 
[02:30:00]  link to server is down  connection to server  cannot be established  all the calls are gone  that might be one way  of doing it  but I didn't do that  it's not connected  to server  wrong  but that message  could come up  another way I'm sure  you were right  from the beginning  it was Mars  that's what it looked like  now Mars is trying  to fucking pass the buck  that's what the screen  looked like  but I would have never  gotten to that point  when you go back  into it  that you and I  that you hit  yeah yeah yeah  it's still there  I can't connect  to the server  you have to get rid of it  right  there's no I in T  let's remember  Opie 
[02:30:30]  this is how the server  looked just before  you held up that sign  that said Vince Vaughn  and you made the  jerk off motion  I was surprised  at that too  I'm like  I only talked to Vince Vaughn  right  I cannot believe  Mars is throwing me  under the bus  because he's panicking  he is totally  throwing you under the bus  on this one  you're crazy  you're a crazy man  you heard him  the host of the show  the star of the show  he's the one  that did it  oh man  look  he's trying to recreate it 
[02:31:00]  I would never do that  yeah  well you know  oh man  Roland who do you believe  Roland  the publicist believes  the engineering department  they said once you get a better one  she'll send me some suggestions  oh wow  me and Ro  me and Ro  Ro  let's talk about the barbecue  Sam  and I know  Roland has my phone number  and you don't  I understand what's going on here  I gave him your phone number though  oh  ouch  got a home run 
[02:31:30]  campos  where's the pit master  he's in the  I guess he's in the office  should we come down here  should we take a leak  I gotta pee real quick  pee  yeah  so that's all this is about  the Vince Vaughn  F up  yeah  but you had an amazing week  yep  yeah  you did  think about it  Doc Gooden  David Lee Roth  Jay Moores  Crispin Glover  Crispin Glover  um  who else  Rob Delaney  was very good 
[02:32:00]  Rob Delaney  and this Vince Vaughn call  is what's got you  that's the thing  wait we had more than  six guests this week  didn't we  gotta let it go  who else did we have  Ro Ro  regardless of  you know  the fact that  Opie  pulled up a picture  of Vince Vaughn  on his phone  and that was just  thrusting his middle finger  into it  and shaking his head  no  when the hotline was ringing  that doesn't matter  he had a great week  is this because  I don't have passion  about racial issues  maybe that's it 
[02:32:30]  that was a fun ride  to the gym yesterday  where you fucking  turn around  high-fiving me in the car  you're like  server folly  yes  Opie said  he goes  if I take  Vince Vaughn's call  how am I going to  fit in more kids stories  fucking people  they're wonderful  they are  so you're going to  be alright Roan  how are you going to  handle this weekend  you're going to be good  yeah  I'm going to  meet the Cuban  tomorrow  oh boy  we love the Cuban

[02:36:00]  for the weekend  Everybody's working  for the weekend  You want a piece  of my heart  That's nice right  I like it  It's a great version  We need more  weekend songs from you  or whoever that was  I can't keep track  All the fucking  conversations that are  going on in this place  What's happening?  Falcon is lost 
[02:36:30]  No barbecue day  is back on sort of  I forgot Falcon  and so did everyone else  It didn't catch up  Not quite a chipper  Barbecue day is back on  Sort of  Limited edition  But people aren't  People aren't  Come on  Opster  Here's the consensus  He scares me  Here's the consensus  We got angry  Panda today  So I don't know  How  Here's the role  Maybe we should just  leave this one alone  Here's the role  in consensus  I'm going to go on  record and say  maybe we should just 
[02:37:00]  leave this one alone  Really?  Who's he mad at?  I just want to say  one thing  He's mad at me  Why?  The consensus is  that has nothing to do  with Travis pointed  at Jim for the record  It has nothing to do  with Vince Vaughn  There are some people  Fearing  Some people are saying  that it's not  Vince Vaughn at all  Remember I said  we should just  leave this one alone  The barbecue situation  It was when  Jimmy said  we don't have girls  in here  Instead of getting  fucking barbecue  we should have  more girls  The barbecue book  came in  It didn't get the 
[02:37:30]  fanfare that was  expected  And then Roland said  fuck this  fuck everybody  I'm canceling  and going home  That's what  the belief is  with some  people here  But I do take  But why would  he be mad at  Jimmy?  For what?  Like we don't  Well because Jimmy  was being a scumbag  to him  But I wasn't  being a scumbag  to him  How does this feel  Jimmy?  How does this feel  Jimmy when you're  trying to make a point  and some assholes  next to you  fucking chiming in  filled my cock up  But no he  Jim's like 
[02:38:00]  I don't know  because he really  wanted barbecue today  Yeah but I  Let's get Roland  I'll be honest with you  The lack of girls  not being in here  is not Roland's fault  I haven't asked  for them either  It's like  I just realized  we haven't had chicks  in here in a while  I guess we get  as guys  and that's not  his fault  We're not asking  for them  Shake hands and make up  I'm not mad at Roland  Well you just said  you were  No I didn't  Roland  Don't kill the messenger  because I didn't  even want to do this  What?  But there are people  thinking that you've 
[02:38:30]  met at Jim Norton  and you're not  met at Vince Vaughn  and what happened  yesterday  Oh yeah Jimmy  If I met Jim  I'd say hey  Travis you're wrong  What?  What are you talking  about me?  When Roland  The Travis theory  is falling apart  The Travis theory  You're an asshole  He's saying  He's saying  we have barbecue  and no girls  But we're not  asking for girls  Roland didn't say  no to girls  We want barbecued girls  Who thought  that Roland 
[02:39:00]  was mad at Jimmy?  I just thought  I felt like  I overbooked  the barbecue people  so I go  No  Oh  Is that the brisket?  This is from  the famous  Franklin Barbecue  Oh my god  Why is it famous?  I'm having one bite  Oh my god  What kind of meat  is that?  This is  People waiting  three hours  Well fucking  give me some  of that  We all love  Roland  Oh my god  look at this  shit  I can barely

[03:12:30]  And it's like  Oh snap I never use  Yeah exactly  I want a good like  Like oh my god  Okay look  Like the Twitter  Fucking app that you use  It's like oh cool  And then you hit it  And it just says  Bug fixes  Minor bugs  Minor bug fixes  Or things you'll never  Have to worry about  Prevents entry  From Saudi Arabia  Oh  Boom  Yeah I don't like those  Oh really  Yeah  Hmm  I had an update  For my  You know the air travel one  Where you can get  All the times  Of your flights  And put it in stuff  It said fixed issue  With crashing 
[03:13:00]  I'm like that's ironic  And how did they do that  It actually was  Fixed issues with crashing  Oh goody  A lot of people are asking  If Crispin Glover  Was batshit crazy  I  I  No  We all heard the stories  Over the years  I thought he was going to be  Like you couldn't even  Interview him crazy  Right  And the guy was  Completely fucking great  Right  Very informative  He wasn't  He just has very strong opinions  Yeah strong opinions  About his craft  He seems a little  He's eccentric 
[03:13:30]  I am wacky  He's eccentric  And he likes  You know  He's very passionate  About his work  But he's not  Out of control  He's not like  You couldn't work  With the guy  I mean he even said  He goes  You know I understand  I'm in the business  Where I gotta  You know  He works  He was in Hot Tub Time Machine  Yeah  That was like two years ago  He's like maybe I shouldn't be saying this  Because I do work  Like yeah he was very aware  Extremely aware  And even the shit that he's known  For being a little crazy about  Which is you know  His back to the future stuff  He even said  Look I'm this 20 year old  Idealistic kid 
[03:14:00]  At that age  Trying to rewrite  The movie  Yesterday was  Back to the future day  We had Crispin Glover in here  And then I go to the gym  Did you see him?  Christopher Lloyd  Hangs out in our gym  What?  You know I thought I saw him  He cut all his hair off  That's why  Wait  He's completely bald  I thought I saw him at the gym  Yeah you did  Working out  The other day  Alright  Working out?  Yeah  I waved to him of course  Yeah  Did you wave back?  No  Doesn't know  I see Warner Wolf all the time  He's seen me perform live 
[03:14:30]  I've seen him  He's a grumpy fuck  When he's not on TV  I love that guy  He's one of the reasons  Why I went into broadcasting  Warner Wolf  That's a fact  Yeah  Yeah  Because he's  Warner Climper  Is why I went into broadcasting  Warner was amazing  Growing up man  I'm right it was stupid  But he's a Nazi  I know he is  I know what he is  No one was better  Sit down Fred  No one was better than  Warner Wolf  Yeah  No one in the New York area  Who came close?  Was he the Swish guy? 
[03:15:00]  He was let's go to the  Videotape guy  Way past when  Was that Marv Albert?  Was it Marv Albert?  Probably  Didn't Warner Wolf  Have a catchphrase  Like fucking  Let's go to the videotape  Boom goes the dynamite  Or something  He would like  Kind of ramp up his report  And all of a sudden  Go alright  Let's go to the videotape  And then boom boom boom  Yeah he was actually  Really good  Let's go to the videotape  He was great  It was one of the reasons  I went into broadcasting  I can swear he had something  When it was the videotape though  Like a boom  Or a fucking  Ooh  Or a wee ha  They all did  But his was let's go to the videotape  Yeah  Yeah that was his number one 
[03:15:30]  And he goes to the gym  And he packs his own lunch  I'm like  Warner Wolf should not be packing  His own lunch  At the gym  Better than packing your own fudge  I tried  We got a gym  With a great little  You know  Eating area  And he sits there  With a little sandwich  And his tinfoil  And pulls out like a soda  I'm like  Jesus  I tried my own catchphrases  When I did sports radio  It never worked  No  What did you have?  What are some good ones  For basketball?  Like Marv Albert would go Swish?  Yeah yeah  I never did that  Boom goes dynamite  Yeah  Like whatever  I would just yell 
[03:16:00]  Man make a basket  Man make a basket  And we'd walk down the street  Where people go  Hey man make a basket  But you have to pound the table  With fervor  I don't like it  No one else did either  Fervor  No one else did  Of course they didn't  Man make a basket  Look at us all  Not wanting to go home  That's amazing  What the hell is that?

About the songs you choose  To have the girls sing with you  Right  Cause it's very humiliating  Is if you turn a song on  And you're like  Yeah, I've been singing this song forever 
[03:39:30]  And they're like  I've never heard this song before  What do you think?  I'm gonna do  They're already listening to this song  Like, what the fuck is this?

[03:40:30]  It might be.  There's no compound, boy.  There's no dinosaurs there.  You're going to be doing the fucking Macarena somewhere.  And there's going to be people having fun.  Everybody on the dance floor.  Electric slide.  Swimming, doing Jell-O shots.  We like a little few Jell-O shots and fucking, you know.  I think it'll be fun.  Who the hell is this?  Why's he got a gas can?  Someone call security.  What is that?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Fucking places.  A circus.  What goes on here? 
[03:41:00]  All right.  Well, you know what?  Everyone, have a great weekend.  The regulars that I know that come over my house, give me a text.  I'll let you know if you make the list.  Yeah, if you make the cut.  If you make the cut for the first real party of the year, I guess.  That's very exciting.  And Saturday is supposed to be nice again.  Yeah, Saturday is supposed to be good.  You have plenty of good food.  A lot of people having fun.  And, you know. 
[03:41:30]  Will you have bathing suits in case the girls don't have bathing suits?  Stop.  I'm just asking.  They have, you know.  Because they're from out of town.  Well, there is a drawer and a cabinet in my laundry room where Angela, it was Keith's  wife.  She takes care of all my stuff.  She's like the PA of my house.  She, like, finds bikinis and stuff laying around in the yard after parties.  And those are in there.  So, sometimes girls go, oh, you know, I didn't bring a swimsuit.  I want to go swimming.  And they could rummage through that.  That sounds terrible.  It's washed.  They're washed. 
[03:42:00]  Look, they're not girls as classy as you girls, first of all.  Some girls that have been to the house.  Obviously, if their bathing suits are left there in the morning.  Do you have a...  Right.  They go home.  It's like the bicycles here in the city.  It's an exchange program.  You pick up a bikini in one place, you drop it somewhere else, and you leave it for somebody  else.  Do you have Bobo's snipped off tighty-whities in that drawer that were left at your house?  No, those things went right in the garbage.  Is he invited?  Because he's always asking to go.  And he has been at the party before. 
[03:42:30]  As a matter of fact, Bobo has been nude in your backyard.  Yeah.  I'm going to leave this one to the Twitter followers.  I'm going to put this to the Twitter followers for a kind of a vote.  Not a very accurate one, but I'll get a consensus.  I'll be able to get a good feel if people want Bobo at this party, or if they don't want  Bobo at this party.  And I will adhere to what they say.  What about you girls?  You know Bobo, right?  You've heard of him?  You've never heard of Bobo?  He started a week ago.  I know.  I thought maybe they might have heard of Bobo. 
[03:43:00]  He's just a weird fucking guy.  He's a weird little guy.  He's all innocent and everything.  He's not like a weird, you know, I'm going to kill you guy.  Well, that's not.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no, no.  But, all right, we'll figure it out.  That's a picture of Bobo right there.  Oh, dear God.  Oh, dear God.  It's not even a dick pic.  And he's constantly looking for a girlfriend.  So, ladies, wow, look out. 
[03:43:30]  Bobo's on the prowl.  There he is with some kind of a ransom note.  Hey, that's the Seinfeld pose.  He's doing the George Costanza pose.  That was the day.  Oh, wow, that one too, right?  Is there one?  I don't think so.  Oh, my God.  There's that.  I mean, that's sexy right there.  He decided to walk in with European cut briefs on for no reason.  What the fuck is with him?  Of course, we just discovered that because we asked him to remove his clothes. 
[03:44:00]  He wrote a comment.  There's somebody else walking around outside the studio hoping that you notice that he's there.  Oh.  You see him?  Who is it?  Denny.  Who?  Denny.  Would you tell Denny?  Wait a minute.  Do you have a DJ?  I could have Denny DJ the party.  That would be huge.  Bring Denny in here.  Let me talk to Denny and see if he's available.  You ever hear Denny fucking DJ?  Look out.  Big question.  I've heard him Saturday on 60s on 6.  I've heard him on a Sunday, 60s on 6. 
[03:44:30]  Hey, everybody.  He does a real good, like, hits the post on a turtle song.  Yeah.  Is Sal invited?  You don't like him.  That's for sure.  He's not a fun guy.  At least he won't harass the women.  That's true.  He won't harass the women.  Being a fucking flaming homo.  Might be a good idea.  Girls love gay guys.  Someone's coming in to talk to you.  Hi, guys. 
[03:45:00]  A fag hag.  A fag hag such as...  I'm not a fun guy.  I can have fun if there's a party.  No.  I can have fun.  I'll pencil it in.  I'll fucking leave some room for fun.  I'm open for some fun.  If somebody's going to give me permission to have fun, I will.  Yeah?  What do you think?  I'd love to go.  You'd love to go?  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Sal.  Thanks, Adam.  He'd love to come.  He'd just camp with a woman.  Yeah.  Oh!  We heard that story.  Remember when you told everyone you couldn't come with a girl?  Yeah.  Remember that, right? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah.  Stop trying to fucking throw everyone else under the bus because you can't go.  Oh!  I don't think that has anything to do with whether or not you can come with a woman.  No, Sam's just generally an asshole.  I don't have nothing to do with not being able to go.  That is true.  I think Sam's a little bitter.  He is an asshole.  I think Sam's a little pissed that he can't go.  Because I would suck for guys.  I would rather go to the compound party.  You're missing that?  Yeah, what would be better to do?  But I could say with sincerity that regardless of why Sal came into the studio, I would probably  try to squeeze in a reference to him not coming with a woman.  I told it on air.  Everyone knows about it. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah, but it's funny to keep it.  It's funny.  Yeah.  You make fun?  Yeah.  It's funny.  Yeah.  It's funny.  All right.  Welcome.  Good Saturday, man.  Thanks.  Welcome.  Saturday.  All right, Sam.  Big party.  Very nice.  I don't think you're saying that.  All right.  And what about Denny?  Yeah, where's Denny?  Where's Denny?  Maybe he can DJ.  I thought you said he was running around outside.  He was.  He was just walking back and forth over here.  Well.  I think Eric just wants to bring Denny.  By his desk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could be good to have him DJ the party.  Maybe he's funny.  He could bring the hard drive of hits. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah.  He calls it the hard drive of hits.  And I'm sure they were hits back in fucking.  Back by the moon landing.  He DJed the fucking.  Yeah.  He DJed the recovery of Apollo 11.  Call Scorch.  See if he wants to come.  No.  Oh.  I don't think Scorch will want to come.  Who else from here?  I guess maybe some of our comic friends.  Yeah.  I know they work, though, a lot on the weekends.  Bobby.  Baby.  DeRosa. 
[03:47:00]  Maybe DeRosa.  I haven't seen Joe DeRosa in a while.  Is there anybody else that you're friends with?  He likes to drink here.  Yeah.  Joe DeRosa likes to drink.  Here?  And get this together.  Party Saturday.  Please.  Tomorrow, you mean.  Oh, look.  She just texted.  Let's see what this is.  She can't wait.  This tomorrow.  The pool looks great.  Seriously.  All right.  Thanks, Ange.  Now, now, get cracking. 
[03:47:30]  Now, party tomorrow.  And then I put dot, dot, dot.  Huge.  It's going to be a huge party.  There it is.  Oh.  I think that's Anthony's kitchen.  That's a little fella on a .50 caliber machine gun.  Oh.  That's not a machine gun.  It's a sniper rifle.  Those will all be put away for the party.  Don't fret.  Don't worry.  Unless you're into guns. 
[03:48:00]  You know.  I don't know if guns interest you.  In which case, interns feel free to play with them.  Right.  I'll just toss them around.  You can juggle with them.  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's all have a gun.  That'll be good.  Denny, I'm just finding out, is dropping a hot deuce right now.  Jesus Christ.  Is that a fucking record thing?  Is that some kind of DJ lingo?  No, he's taking a shit.  Yeah, we're dropping a hot deuce.  This one from 1967.  We should tell him it is. 
[03:48:30]  Just to hear him say,  spinning hot deuces all night.  Spinning hot deuces.  It does sound like something he'd say.  Yeah, you can get him to say it.  Remember this hot deuce from back in the morning.  Yeah, I do, Denny.  We got steaming hot deuces all night long.  Your pal, that is South Code.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Well, fuck it.  If he's available, send him the email.  I will.  And tell him I'd like him to DJ.  You know, that'd be cool. 
[03:49:00]  Are you paying?  I'd pay him.  I'd pay him for a night.  Wow.  You know, he's fucking working.  He's not going to be able to enjoy all the liberties of the party  because he's going to be, you know,  spinning hot deuces.  I don't know what he's doing.  Just dropping those steaming hot deuces for you.  Steaming hot fucking deuces.  Anyone from the Ron and Fez show that we might want there?  Pepper Hicks, maybe?  Maybe Pepper?  What about?  What about Eastside Dave?  Extending the invitation to Davey.  Does Eastside Dave McDonald do a show, though?  Yeah.  Saturday.  But it ends at 9.  His show ends at 9. 
[03:49:30]  He could be there at 9.  Oh, it will be.  Believe me.  Get there by 10.  You'd still have a lot of parties.  These parties go well into, like, Sunday kind of a thing.  They kind of ooze.  And Dave is always one of those last lingerers.  He is.  Yeah, what did I see a photo last time?  You guys just have some steaks at 8 in the morning.  Yeah, it was 8 in the morning steak breakfast.  And we ate the steaks in the pool.  It was great.  It was great.  Very irresponsible.  Picking bones out of the skimmer.  It was wonderful.  It was the weekend.  Yes!  The weekend.  Freaking weekend.  Indeed. 
[03:50:00]  Pool's broken anyway.  Eat whatever you want.  No, it's not.  It's wonderful.  Sure.  Ange says it looks great.  Looks.  Seriously.  Seriously, too.  Looks great.  I'm seriously.  You get the remix to Ignition in that karaoke machine?  Oh, hell yeah.  Good.  Don't worry about it.  I'm going to have Vinny make sure it's all updated.  And we could put a couple of live from the compound cameras up to get compound karaoke  and a party cam.  Do you think you could get those Sean F. songs in the karaoke machine?  That would be good.  E-Rock would want to sing some of the songs. 
[03:50:30]  Imagine making E-Rock sing karaoke to his own fatty songs.  How fucking fun would that be?  E-Rock comment.  Imagine me just punching you in the face.  Whoa.  Wow.  Wow.  Fucking ruin my party.  Yeah, the whole party is only because, like, E-Rock's going to have a sex party.  I know.  His wife's throwing a dill party.  E-Rock was having a dildo party at his house.  He didn't want to stay there.  So I figured I'd have a party so he could come over.  I don't want to have just me and the Nagel in the house.  No way.  What an uncomfortable fucking time that would be. 
[03:51:00]  Us just, yeah, so how about the show the other day?  Want to watch Doctor Who?  We'll have our zero in common conversation.  He'd bring up cartoons.  I'd be like, what?  Remember Animaniacs?  What?  Yeah, I remember Animaniacs.  It was awesome.  Yeah.  Hey, how about that Simpsons episode?  Yeah, I kind of fucking off the Simpsons thing.  I'm going to go hang in your theater.  Oh, right.  I'll be upstairs on my computer.  He'll be in my theater.  Yeah.  That would be a lonely-ass fucking party with the Nagel.  Would you be mad if you caught him jerking off in your theater? 
[03:51:30]  Because he totally would.  To the Simpsons.  He definitely...  Oh, would you spank at my theater?  No.  Jesus Christ.  He would.  He would.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to bring you a bottle of wine first.  He'd get all sad because his face isn't on one of the poker chips.  Oh, that's right.  Why isn't Eric on one of the poker chips?  I'm not either.  Sam's not either.  You can't fit my face on it, probably.  Whoa, Eric's so harsh.  Oh, jeez.  It could be the 1,000 pounds chip.  See, it's another weight joke.  All right.  I guess we're done here for the day.  Oh, yeah.  Are we done for this wonderful Friday? 
[03:52:00]  I'll see everybody Saturday, tomorrow.  This is going to be great.  Never mind.  I'll have fun.  Don't worry about it.  I swear.  I have such a wonderful party.  He's going to have fun.  I have such a horrid reputation.  I wonder if I hope he's really going to go.  I hope so.  I hope so, too.  I think it'd be a lot of fun.  It's been a while since he's been at the house.  He has to babysit his kids.  Oh, man.  He's taking shots in there.  Yeah, I hear that.  Well, early in the day, there are kind of, you know, people with kids.  Yeah.  Like the Tefts will come. 
[03:52:30]  I'll bring you.  Like that.  Vinny will probably come, bring his kids and stuff like that.  But then, you know, as the evening goes on, the kids go home.  When would you like the interns to arrive?  Oh, I see what you did there.  Just ask.  Want to send a car for them?  Maybe more towards the evening.  Oh, that's kind of a good suggestion.  A car there and back so you don't have to drive after so much soda.  You might be a little nervous from the caffeine.  A little shaky on the steering wheel.  Very smart.  Yeah.  We don't even have cars here.  We'll send a vehicle for you. 
[03:53:00]  7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7  Denny's rushing in.  Denny.  Yes, I am.  Do you have a gig this Saturday, which is tomorrow?  Yes, I do.  What?  Communion season.  I'm not kidding.  I'm not kidding you.  I got a communion.  Four to eight.  Four to eight.  Eight.  He could be the night time DJ, though.  The party DJ.  Where's the communion?  What's that?  Where is it?  It's in Long Island.  It's in Mineola.  Fuck!  That's like the next town over. 
[03:53:30]  You can get Troy to DJ the first half of the party,  and then once it really gets revved up,  get Denny on the hot deuces.  Denny, I'm having a party at my house tomorrow.  A lot of work people are going to be there.  And I would have liked for you to DJ that event.  Time to call short notice DJ.  Hello?  He actually used his phone as a prop in that exchange.  Well, you need the reality of this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[03:54:00]  If you don't believe it, neither will they.  How's the weather going to be? Do you have a tent?  No, I don't have a tent.  Because electronics and rain really don't go too well together.  No, no.  But it's supposed to be nice, right, Saturday?  I heard.  I think this whole thing is blowing over, as they say.  High 75.  So we will look.  Beautiful.  I'm seeing Saturday sunny, 77 degrees.  Let me see where I live.  77 WABC degrees.  ABC degrees. 
[03:54:30]  Love it, Denny.  They used to love that.  Well, yeah.  It's looking like a nice sunny day.  What about after your communion gig?  Yeah, I could probably get there about 9 o'clock or so.  Around 9?  What time does the gig go until your party?  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  It could be like one of the headlines.  No, though.  9 o'clock.  It's a little late for him to show up.  Dude.  I mean, because we've got to make contingency plans for before 8.  What do we do before fucking 9?  Get Troy to do the first half of the party. 
[03:55:00]  If he's willing, I'm sure he would.  If he's there, let him just keep going.  I don't know.  I DJ tomorrow night.  I have a gig.  Perfect, then.  And then Denny picks up the party at 10 p.m.  Tag team.  Tag team DJ champions.  I don't think I have music that the party would like.  What?  What?  You have music every party would like.  What do you think this is?  Well, it's more like...  The old folks home?  Techno and EDM?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Top 40.  There's going to be young girls there.  Girls like EDM.  Yes, they do.  Yes, Denny.  You're saying you don't have Denny's hard drive of hits?  I don't, no.  His music would be better off for nighttime when things get way out of control. 
[03:55:30]  Well, Denny needs to make do with what we have right now.  I understand.  Don't undersell yourself here.  No, I'm not.  I'm trying to help out.  I'm trying to work you guys at home.  I could probably just turn on Sirius XM satellite radio through the Sonos system in the backyard  and just blast that away.  Keep Electric Area going.  Well, wait a minute.  Lose yourself a gig.  No, I don't want to know.  Get the same 13 songs played over and over again.  I'd love to do it.  Yeah, sure.  I'd love to do it.  My future flies in the Vaseline wheel. 
[03:56:00]  Sometime, bro, my man.  Keep getting stuck here on the chair.  Spoonman!  The girls would be like, what band is this?  What is this?  What?  This came out before I was born.  Raidman!  Okay, we get it.  Alice in Chains, Soundgarden.  And then the song starts.  No, I'd be kicking off with the stuff they're playing on Hits 1.  You know, Macklemore.  You've got to get Denny down there.  I know.  He's got the hard drive of Hits.  The roof can't hold us.  Show up.  Show up.  The roof can't hold us.  Put Denny on the email list.  Get those hands up. 
[03:56:30]  Because when that lyric comes on, that's what I do.  Come on, get those hands up.  I think it's the ceiling.  Denny's on the email list.  The ceiling can't hold us.  The ceiling can't hold us.  What's that?  Oh, yeah.  You got some iconopop?  Yeah.  I got all their hit.  All their hit.  Yeah.  He's a fucking pistol.  You got one song.  That's good.  Although they're on tour this summer.  Yeah.  Emblem 3.  That's the new shit.  Yes, they were up here the other day.  Yeah.  He knows the new shit.  Emblem 3 is the new shit.  He knows the new shit.  They're a boy band.  No worries. 
[03:57:00]  I got some Minuto, too.  Get the fuck out of here with that.  What the fuck here is this?  Where's Mars?  He's excited about Minuto.  So what's the theme?  Do you have a theme for this part?  A theme?  You need bitches moving.  You need glow sticks?  We're going to be rolling.  Get some Molly on him, motherfucker.  Do you bring Molly to the gigs, Denny?  Yeah.  Molly?  Every good DJ brings Molly.  You don't roll Molly?  Hatchet?  No.  What?  Woo!  Molly.  Woo!  Yeah, it's just Molly stuff.  Did you ever roll, Denny?  No.  Never?  No.  What about a little nose can? 
[03:57:30]  Do you ever do that?  No, no, I don't.  What about back in the day?  No, I never did that.  What about the other day?  When I used to DJ in bars, they used to do, you know, last call before o'clock.  I was looking forward to going to the diner for grilled cheese and bacon and hash browns.  And these guys on the bar, they're saying, they're cleaning up and they're putting this  white stuff on the bar.  I said, no thanks.  It's time to go home.  Yeah, I don't do that stuff.  Hmm.  Don't do that stuff.  Good boy.  Good boy.  I just start playing, you know, Born to be Alive by Patrick Hernandez, and that just gets  me jumping.  Born.  Oh, God, all the hits. 
[03:58:00]  Yeah.  1979.  Hey!  Denny's definitely popping Molly's.  You know he is.  Denny, Denny, you're in.  You're coming.  Okay, Molly.  Have you seen Molly?  I have no idea.  Oh, wow, that's fast on the trigger.  I like that.  You got that working on Columbia Records with Patrick Hernandez as we get this party jumping.  Here we are at Anthony's house.  Everybody, get those hands up.  Let me see you make some noise.  I can't wait until this is happening in my house.  And it'll be 10 o'clock.  Everybody's drinking by then. 
[03:58:30]  You're going to have a lot of great Vine videos.  Oh, hell yeah.  This is going to be so good.  What if you have Denny DJing?  Yeah.  And Bobo is on the dance floor.  Oh, no.  I mean, you want to do Vine videos?  He's got to be voted in.  You need Bobo at this party.  I'm going to review all the tweets because, yeah, the Twitter community is pretty much  deciding whether Bobo should or shouldn't be invited to this party.  He's the right-in vote.  Yeah, he's the right-in.  Yeah.  And a lot of people, a lot of people like to, like, hurt Bobo. 
[03:59:00]  Yes.  So they'll probably vote no, with the only reason being they want him to feel bad.  But a lot of people also like to put you in humiliating circumstances.  True, true.  And a lot of people probably want to see that situation.  True.  They want to see Bobo at my house, at the pool party.  Now that's a situation.  Dancing to Denny.  Hey.  It's a very tricky situation.  Would he get there with a bag over his head again?  Yeah, last time he was at the party, Keith the cop picked him up from the train station 
[03:59:30]  and drove him from the train station to my house with a bag over his head so he wouldn't  know where I lived.  Yeah, because we didn't want him returning like a fucking stray cat that you fed.  Then we convinced him to go swimming in his tighty-whities and Danny jumped in the pool  with scissors behind him and snipped off his underwear so he was in my pool naked.  It's not like Rupert Pupkin showing up at your house.  The King of Comedy?  Remember that?  Yeah.  When De Niro showed up at Jerry Lewis' house?  Fucking Denny Thalarian.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that, though.  Denny, can I ask you a question? 
[04:00:00]  Go ahead.  What's the best gift to give the woman in your life?  Probably something from Stephen A. Singer, though, right?  Well, it's the best gift.  I don't know if that's his middle name.  It's all business.  The best gift for any occasion or no occasion at all is an I love you gift.  I hate that Sam is more professional than I am.  You think so?  I wouldn't have.  I'd have been like, I'd blow off the read.  We're having fun.  Fuck it.  It's Friday.  Stephen Singer's like, he's one of the few people that sponsored the after show.  I say fuck Stephen Singer, too.  Gotta pay the bills.  Look at me.  You hate Stephen Singer.  Have Denny do it.  You are?  All right.  Denny.  Denny. 
[04:00:30]  I've never heard Denny do a read.  I've heard him.  You guys make fun of me all the time.  I've heard him back sell and front sell songs.  Wait, wait, wait.

And I broke one of my cardinal rules.  I did not pre-read the copy.  Wow.  You got to pre-read.  You got to pre-read.  Someone might sneak a dirty word in there and you might just say it and get fired. 
[04:02:00]  The FCC will come and get you.  Maybe that's why you said 8-8 instead of 8-8-8.  8-8-8.  Oh.  I was just waiting for another copy.  That sound effect.  That's right.  Now, where'd you get the serious fucking hoodie?  I asked one of the facilities guys.  They get everything.  You know what?  I should fucking be able to get one of those.  You want one of those?  Walk around with Pride, the place I work.  I love swag.  Hoodies up.  All that stuff.  I could hoodie up for Trayvon.  All right.  Well, everybody, I can't wait.  Saturday.  Oh, you can't make it.  I'm jealous.  You can make it early. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah.  And then it's Paul McCartney all night.  Yeah, exactly.  Where are you going, Sam?  I mean, I'm staying in Rhinebeck, New York.  Oh, well, that's where the party is.  Rhinebeck, New York.  Apparently not.  Very nice area.  Very affluent.  Did a wedding up there once.  That's where I'm going to a wedding.  What a coincidence.  Wow.  How about that?  It's not good.  The DJ ain't even going to be close to this man.  Are you going to be leading the line for the Cupid Shuffle?  I don't think I will.  I don't think I'm going to do that.  The Cupid Shuffle.  How about Gangnam Style?  Gangnam Style I might get down with.  Oh, that would be cool.  In the backyard. 
[04:03:00]  Gangnam Style.  We could do the dance.  Or as the kid's grandfather last week came up to me, thought he was hip.  He goes, could you play that song, Gangnam Style?  Yeah.  Gangnam Style.  Gangnam Style.  Ride that pony.  Gangnam Style.  Jesus Christ.  Ride that pony.  Come on.  Ride it.  She didn't even look at him.  Trey is not happy about Denny going to this party.  Because when you're standing behind the booth, you just can't stand there and, you know,  you've got to get into it.  You're going to get into it.  You're pretty much the lead for the people.  There you go. 
[04:03:30]  If you're moving and having a good time, the people are going to move and have a good time.  Move right out of the party.  Yeah.  Find a place to have a good time.  I wish Denny would do that dance that the guy outside the Today Show did yesterday.  Oh, I didn't see that.  I didn't see that.  I didn't see that.  Right down his wrists.  No.  Well, party out on Long Island this weekend.  Do you want me to bring the hula hoops and the limbo pole and everything?  I don't think we need any of those props.  What about the inflatable saxophones?  Oh, boy.  And the sunglasses.  So when you play that fucking... 
[04:04:00]  Take those old records off the show.  You could fucking get out there.  Give out the sunglasses?  What are you ewing about?  That's what you're going to be doing.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  You're going to be there Saturday.  It's night.  Yeah, my party's not going to be any fun.  You're not going to have an air guitar contest?  We're out there.  Come on.  Not that I'm going to take part in.  Air guitar.  Air guitar.  Air guitar.  We told our wedding DJ, don't try any of that fucking shit.  Like, no games.  Right.  No props.  None of it.  Good.  Be a professional up there.  It's embarrassing. 
[04:04:30]  And then he came over and he...  That was Jess's thing.  And then he came over and fucked with Jess in the middle of the wedding.  He goes, here, guys, take these.  This is for the balloon game later.  And he put balloons in front of Jess.  And Jess was like, did he just say a fucking balloon game?  Oh, that's a fun game.  When you put the balloon between your thighs and you have to walk down and you have to give it to your partner.  He was...  Yeah.  No hands.  He was kidding.  We're not going to have any fucking balloon games in the wedding.  I like doing that with girls having miscarriage.  It's the same game, just a little sloppier.  That's a fun game.  What?  Yeah.  Crazy. 
[04:05:00]  Things can get way out of control.  Wow.  Look out.  We could do it.  You want to do adult musical chairs?  That's always fun, too.  What?  Yeah.  If the chairs are upside down, maybe.  Yeah.  That's a fun musical chairs.  There's four to a chair.  Get a peg in the middle of it.  Of course.  Yeah.  You guys always seem to have a different take on things.  Yeah.  Do you know why this party is happening?  Tell me.  Because Eric's wife is kicking Eric out of the house because she's throwing some kind of party where her and her friends are going to dill each other.  Dill?  Dill. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah.  It's a dildo party.  You ever see these parties where the girls get together and they buy and sell fucking...  It's like on HBO Real Sex 13.  Right, right.  Something like that.  That's exactly right.  Yeah.  In between the segment where the guys are out in the woods naked hugging each other and playing a bongo drum to get in touch with themselves.  That's funny.  And their masculinity.  Yeah.  And the other one where they're trying to teach women in their 60s how to give head.  But you'd think Eric would want to stay home because then his wife would be all hot and bothered after the party.  His wife is bothered every day.  She looks at her fucking husband. 
[04:06:00]  Yeah, she'd get hot and then she'd get bothered.  You know what?  Eric's wife is hot and bothered.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was hot.  Now I'm bothered.  Oh, Eric.  Give me your address off the air and leave work at the security compound.  I am telling Travis who is going.  He will send emails out to everybody with the address and info, time, things like that. 
[04:06:30]  Okay, very good.  And, of course, a special person who will be working the party.  You'll get special information.  Okay.  You know, maybe with songs.  Maybe if there are any props you want to bring.  I would like to have him bring props just to see him try to get people to do it.  You should have, like, old school wedding DJ.  Just see how that crowd reacts to it.  Oh, God.  They just go, what the fuck is this?  Well, I got a great remix version of Let's Twist again where it's, like, five, six minutes where I put the hula hoops out and I just tell people, go wild.  Oh, you know.  Go wild with hula hoops.  I bet Big A would love to try that. 
[04:07:00]  That's true.  Big A will be coming.  So, that's, uh, Big A could try something with the hula hoop.  And if you get Dave McDonald to your party, he saw Dave McDonald's great.  He will party with Denny.  He'll literally burn the place down.  Yeah.  He's been known to do that.  He tried it at E-Rox, but he did.  Yeah.  All right.  Sounds like fun.  All right.  Look at the time already.  Does Denny want to leave us on a, going into a record?  Do you want me to wear a Hawaiian shirt or anything?  You know what?  That says fun.  That does.  That says a party's going on.  All right.  Nobody's here to work. 
[04:07:30]  That's for sure.  Right, right.  I'm fucking, I'm psyched.  It sounds good.  It's going to be a good one.  Saturday night.  Saturday night.  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  Well, that's a no intro song.  Okay, you can't slide that one.  Okay, that's true.  What song are you going to play, E?  I don't know.  Whatever Denny wants.  Denny, what do you think?  Is it a good Friday?  Friday.  Friday.  Here we go.  We're going to start our weekend.  We want to get a little information out there.  We want to tell people, hey, it's time to have some fun.  It's definitely time to have some.  How about a little Black Eyed Peas, maybe? 
[04:08:00]  I love it.  All right.  Doing something a little more contemporary.  I hear you.  A little.  All right.  Give me the, uh...  Let's just throw one at me.  What about Let's Get It Started, huh?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's got a no intro.  Don't stop the party.  Don't stop the party.  Yeah.  Don't stop...  Let's get retarded.  Ha!  Go next time.  Well, that's the original version of the song.  Let's get retarded in here.  Yeah.  Ha!  Fergie was just singing about being retarded.  Fergie was fucking singing retarded. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, that would have gone over very well.  And whatever you got, Yoron.  Don't stop the party.  Hey!  Whoa!  Oh!  Wait a minute.  This is something.  Sam, your show is just kicking ass lately.  I can't...  I mean, Wednesdays were great.  Well, it was a night.  Oh.  That's the best show that he does all week.  I like it.  But now, that's Friday.  You gotta know.  Wednesday is not...  Jim does a show on Wednesday.  That's Jim.  Oh!  I'm not on...  Oh!  That's why it's better. 
[04:09:00]  See what happens on Wednesday.  And, uh...  Doing meth today?  What's the big deal?  What's happening?  Uh, you know what?  I'm doing red-eye this evening for Fox News.  Oh!  So, I can...  I can lollygag around without worrying about traffic too much.  What are you, uh...  What are you gonna be doing?  Defending the president?  Uh, I believe, yes, that Obama is getting the shitty end of the stick, as I say.  And, uh, I'm gonna get on there and really back him up on this, uh, uh, 20 scandals that  are going on.  Should be controversial.  I'm setting...  I'm setting my alarm for three.  Set it for three. 
[04:09:30]  Because, you know what?  You don't even want to DVR.  You gotta see this live.  I gotta see it live.  You can't be like, I wasn't there as he was saying this.  Right.  I don't want to say I was asleep when, you know?  What's with the chicks?  This is working out nice.  These are our, uh, two, uh, lovely interns.  Wow.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Um, and, and I'm having a party tomorrow at my house.  A giant fucking party.  You know what?  I'm going to leave now and act like I know nothing about anything.  Do you think that management will be questioning who knew what, when? 
[04:10:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to be any part of that.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to be able to honestly say I have no idea.  No idea.  That's what I'm after.  Well, it's, it's a, it's a big, you know, uh, big work kind of friend party.  By the way, are they sisters?  Is that what you guys have?  No.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah.  They kind of do look like, you know, sisters a little bit.  There's something.  Well, the fact that you're both blonde and cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's very Milton twins for the people out there at home.  I think that's the angle that you're looking for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Milton twins. 
[04:10:30]  If he rocks hair was frosted, he'd be the tripper.  One pervert knows what I'm talking about.  Oh, Jesus.  But, uh, yeah, there's a big, I've been, uh, sending the invites out.  Of course, you're cordially invited too.  I'd love to be there for this.  Let me see if I can get a bend on and head right over.  It looks like, um, it looks like trouble.  Hey, Ewok, how about for the ladies who slip in a little brick house?  Oh.  Wow.  That is a good one.  Ow, she's a brick house.  It's great to play songs before they were born.  That's pretty much everything. 
[04:11:00]  This is what they're like when you were in high school, if someone dropped in Chattanooga  Choo Choo.  Just take a listen to the beat.  Listen to this song.  You're going to love a trailer for sale or rent.  What?  Rooms to let 50.  That's right.  There it is.  So the girls, uh, they're in college.  The girls are in college.  Yeah, they're college girls.  They're, uh, interning, I guess, a career in broadcasting in the future.  What, yeah, what, there is no broadcasting in the future. 
[04:11:30]  There is no future, yeah.  There's no, you missed it.  What, what school, ladies?  I go to Florida Gulf Coast in Florida.  Oh, nice, I know that place, yeah.  I go to Brockport, upstate New York.  Yeah, all right.  She interned for Brother Weiss.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  Okay, so.  Brother Weiss sent her down here.  Uh, it's like a fucking baseball.  It's a foreign team.  We're trading.  This kid can really hit.  They go and take a look at it.  Yeah, we're gonna trade her, uh, and a coffee bringer to be named later. 
[04:12:00]  Sam, remember when you were the new girl?  Remember those days?  Yeah, Sam.  I was pretty.  Everybody paid attention to me.  Everybody was like, ooh, who's she?  Wow.  Syracuse.  Yeah.  Ask me questions about myself like they were interested.  They did.  Remember when fucking Bob Kelly was in love with you?  I do.  He was literally in love with this fresh-faced little kid.  Now he's got the Fred Flintstone whiskers, and it's just not, not, you still have cherubish  cheeks, but the rest of you is like a construction worker. 
[04:12:30]  Yeah, they look misplaced now.  Yeah, yeah.  You look like that fucking, um, that video from fucking, what was that?  Well, I fucking just lost it.  Just lost it.  That video from fucking, um, yeah.  I don't know, I'm just stuck in an awkward stage now.  Yeah, you really are in an awkward stage right now.  You're 30.  Yeah, you're all buck teeth and elbows.  You don't know which way your body's growing.  Oh, it looks like a little cult.  A newborn cult.  Your voice is doing odd things.  Oh, Jesus.  Poor Sam. 
[04:13:00]  Kneecaps like an anorexic.  Yeah.  Poor kid.  It's tough.  Yeah, but everybody's coming.  Stinky's coming, Roland, we're gonna have Danny DJing.  Wait a minute, we're back to calling him Stinky again after all these years?  Well, you know what?  A little Nostalgia Friday.  Right.  It's Nostalgia Friday.  Because when I see him, I'm always like, hey, drop the Stinky thing.  Yeah, and stay tuned for ronandfez.com coming up pretty shortly.  I love that.  That's called the internet, everyone.  Ronandfez.com.  I used to love hanging out on that show. 
[04:13:30]  Do you remember any of it?  Barely, but I recall people telling me I had fun.  You were.  That was good.  And then I would stay for Eddie Trunk's show.  On those banner nights.  Wow.  Yeah, Eddie started at like 3 a.m.  Yeah.  Oh, this was the intro music.  Wow, yeah.  Yeah, that was only, what, 13 years ago?  Fuck.  Isn't that terrible?  Oh, girls, what were you doing 13 years ago?  I don't know.  No, no.  Chuck E. Cheese parties, probably. 
[04:14:00]  Yeah.  On, Denny.  Chuck E. Cheese parties?  Denny.  Denny really throwing him out there, man.  Goddamn, Denny.  Is this the kind of action I can expect as you DJ my party Saturday?  I'm going to turn it up.  You going to have any alcohol there?  Any.  He's fearless.  I have it all.  I cannot wait.  What?  I cannot wait.  Oh, believe me, this will be a hell of a show.  This will be a hell of a show.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  It's going to be fun, Ronnie.  I know it is.  Come on.  I know it is.  Make a party. 
[04:14:30]  I'm sending a car for him so he doesn't have to drive.  You know, 777-777-777.  Yeah.  Send that car with the driver.  His last name will be Singh.  Is anyone else but Singh?  Living in Brooklyn this summer, is that the deal?  No, I'm out in Long Island.  Oh, no.  Oh, well, that'll be a close.  Yeah.  It'll be easy for you.  Ronkonkoma.  I used to do a few jobs out there in Ronkonkoma.  A few construction jobs.  What does Colin call it?  The conk?  The conk.  Yeah.  Out in the conk.  It's a little Hawaiian there for a second. 
[04:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  You're laying out by the lake.  It's nice.  It's nice out there.  You ever go to the lake yet?  I haven't done anything.  Oh, it's beautiful out there.  It's just like the crystal beaches of Lake Ronkonkoma.  Oh, it sounds lovely.  It's an oversized puddle.  Please.  Why do I feel like this is an HLN fucking crime story ready to take place?  Nancy Grace is listening to this show, Licketer Chops.  That Friday, he did not leave with Opie and Jim. 
[04:15:30]  He hung around, still talking to the youngsters.  Oh, my God.  Actually, the whole thing got started because E-Rock, his wife, is having one of those dildo parties at her house where all the girls get together and buy and sell various sexual favors.  Wait a minute, they buy and sell as if there's something like that.  It's like the stock market.  It's a swap meet.  Yeah, it's like a swap meet for dildos.  You're going to want to dip that in Clorox first.  Yeah, yeah. 
[04:16:00]  Treat it like somebody's works.  Where do you go when the dildo party's taking place?  Oh, I'm going to Ant's house.  And that's what happened.  So I'm like, Nagel, come over to my house on Saturday.  And then the thought of me and Eric just kind of palling around at my house, I had to invite as many people over as I could possibly think of.  So now it's a giant party happening, so I probably won't even see Eric.  Bring a box of dildos just for fun.  You should.  Like in the pool, they'll be floating around.  We'll play with them.  Throw them at each other.  It'll be fun.  The girls don't swim, so lifeguard on duty. 
[04:16:30]  We got swimmies.  We got the little swimmies for the arms and stuff.  It'll be great.  So bad.  Don't worry about it.  What was HR thinking?  Puffing stuff?  No.  Oh, that one.  Because weren't you guys banned from having female interns?  I'm not kicking them in the balls.  Like some people.  Well, we were banned from having interns at all.  I know.  You know what?  It's a goodwill gesture.  I've never really treated the interns very nicely.  I think we know that.  Right.  It's time to turn over New Leaf and start treating the interns like actual human beings. 
[04:17:00]  You may not be aware that while this whole conversation has been going on, there is one male intern that was not invited to the party.  That's just been sitting in the booth.  Well, let me tell you something.  I got to draw the line somewhere.  We're pretty much at capacity.  It's not nice.  Hey, good friend and Fez is having a party.  What's going on in the Ron and Fez program today?  Nothing.  Who you got?  Anyone coming in?  Yeah, a guy coming in with free cigars.  So it's going to be a great show. 
[04:17:30]  We have free barbecued meat.  The listeners loved it.  What's this one called?  Oh, that's nice.  Oh, that's good.  Roland, how did the barbecue meat go over?  Did Jimmy like it?  Oh, boy.  You're breaking open some fresh wounds there, Ronnie.  It wasn't a good...  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  We all thought it was Vince Vaughn and his phone call didn't get through.  It turns out, you know, Jimmy poo-pooed the book.  He was talking about how we'd probably rather have girls in here than barbecue.  How the listeners don't want to hear us eating barbecue. 
[04:18:00]  And I think Roland just said, fuck this, fuck you, fuck the barbecue, cancel it, and I'm going home.  And then I guess he thought better of it and blamed it on Vince Vaughn.  Hello!  I'm like a regular Columbo.  When something like that happens, he starts to then pray that Vince's movie flops.  Yeah, yeah.  That's always the fun part.  Yep.  How'd that fucking work out for you, huh?  The $13 million opening.  Somebody said that that new Vince Vaughn movie looks like the best movie of 2005. 
[04:18:30]  The Onion.  Because these guys go to Google but don't understand how the internet works.  Right.  You don't understand.  We grew up in the 80s and we didn't have this.  Catch the fuck up.  Girls, the 80s?  Anything?  Got any material on the 80s?  We weren't born in the 80s?  What?  No.  92.  Doing a little blow back in the 80s?  She came in with Kurt Cobain.  Same.  Yep.  Same thing.  You're a grunge baby. 
[04:19:00]  You are.  You're a teen spirit.  That's it.  What about you?  80s?  No, 93.  93!  So she was there when he killed himself.  That's a short period of grunge.  That's great.  Very short.  That's Jay Thomas.  Wow.  You know who Jay Thomas is?  He just walked by.  You ever hear of Jay Thomas?  Broadcasting?  No, that's not him.  They're looking and going, I guess not.  He just walked by.  He's a broadcaster.  Mark and Mindy?  Anything there?  Mr. Holland's Opus? 
[04:19:30]  Cheers.  He used to run the low.  He was on Cheers.  Sam and Diane?  Do you want to know his name?  Well, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  But he wasn't either of those.  Oh.  He had walk-ons.  Yeah, yeah.  He played someone's husband, right?  Carlos' husband.  Carlos' husband.  Eddie LeBat.  Right, the hockey player.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's also Mr. Holland's Opus.  Now he works right down the hall from us.  It's amazing.  It's amazing the career arc.  And there's a once a year Letterman where he tells the same story.  You ever see that?  Yeah.  Letterman brings it back and makes him tell the same story.  Same story. 
[04:20:00]  Exactly.  It's perfect.  All right.  Well, our work here is well overdone.  Songs ready for Danny to take us out.  Danny is going to take us out with a song.  Stay tuned for RonandFez.com.  Love that.  RonandFez.com.  Stay tuned for the Ron and Ron show.  We're really going back.  And take us out, Danny.  We'll see you all on Monday.  Great.  All right.  We're here at the Anthony Summer Bash 2013.  Got a list of great requests that he laid on me.  How about we take it back to 1977, guys, who got together at Tuskegee University. 
[04:20:30]  I am talking.  It's time to get down.  Ladies, put your hands up.  Gentlemen, put your hands on your lady because you know what?  She is one hell of a brick house.  Let's do it.  Woo!  Yeah!  All right.  See you Monday.  She ain't right to my cat.  Just letting it all hang out.  She's a brick house.  Like a little stack.  Mass Effect.  Ain't holding nothing back.  Ow!  She's a brick.
