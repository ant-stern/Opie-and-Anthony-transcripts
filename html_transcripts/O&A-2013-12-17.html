<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with Anthony's harrowing tale of a vomit-filled night due to his sick children and the subsequent frustrating Christmas tree acquisition, further complicated by his son's earache and a lengthy pharmacy visit.  This led to a discussion about the challenges of parenting and the absurdities of dealing with sick children and medical bureaucracy. The hosts then recounted a surprisingly tense meeting with the SiriusXM CEO, contrasting their casual attire with the CEO's formal demeanor and the CEO's business-like focus on the show's app issues and overall performance.  This was followed by a discussion about a recent robbery and murder at the Short Hills Mall, which segued into a conversation about personal safety, gun laws, and the lottery, highlighting the incongruity between the low odds of winning the lottery and the higher likelihood of experiencing a violent crime.  A lengthy, humorous segment dissected John Parr's "Naughty Naughty" music video, speculating on the identity of the vixen (revealed to be Lisa Rinna), and diverging into Parr's other work and other 80s artists like Donna Summer. The hosts also announced Nirvana and Kiss's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Profane and vulgar language was used extensively throughout this portion.

The show then shifted to a discussion of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees, focusing on the merits (or lack thereof) of Peter Gabriel, Hall & Oates, and Cat Stevens, punctuated by sarcastic commentary and snippets of their music.  The hosts debated the bands' musical quality and popularity, comparing Hall & Oates' extensive discography to Jay-Z's, and also discussed Saga and Asia, playing their music and offering critical commentary. Listener calls added varied perspectives to the debate, while a tangential discussion about Rachel Campos-Duffy from *The Real World* and the show's overall cast emerged. This section concluded with an apology for playing a song with offensive lyrics and a bizarre tangent about a documentary on bestiality.  The hosts also discussed a listener's ill-fitting sweatshirt and the state of street food vendors.

The next segment featured a graphic and sexually explicit discussion about a woman having sex with a miniature stallion, accompanied by sexually suggestive jokes and commentary from the hosts and possibly a guest.  This was followed by a celebrity identification game using video clips from old TV shows like *Nanny and the Professor* and *The Brady Bunch*, leading to discussions of masturbation to childhood television shows.  A listener called in to promote their stand-up comedy, followed by a Steven Singer Jewelers advertisement, more off-color banter, and a comedic bit about a guest's broken headphones. A recording of an automated phone survey provided further comedic fodder, followed by a return to the miniature stallion story with additional descriptions and speculation.  A PajamaGram advertisement followed, again with sexually suggestive commentary.  Jim Norton's advice segment concluded the segment, offering advice to a caller about a relationship with a married man, followed by a final PajamaGram advertisement.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to listener calls focusing on various personal struggles.  These included detailed accounts of alcoholism,  marital problems stemming from lack of affection, the challenges of long-distance relationships, relapse after sobriety, curiosity about relationships with transsexual individuals, and erectile dysfunction.  The hosts offered advice, often suggesting 12-step programs, but also acknowledged the difficulties and varying experiences with such programs. Some callers shared their own negative experiences with 12-step programs.  The hosts' responses were often interspersed with crude and vulgar language and advertisements for PajamaGram and Steven Singer Jewelers.

The final segment included a caller, Mike, discussing his sobriety journey, crediting his girlfriend for his positive progress but acknowledging the role of recovery groups and cautioning against solely relying on his relationship for staying sober.  The hosts, including Jim Norton, offered support and advice.  Another caller, Trevor from Pennsylvania, briefly mentioned his struggle with drug addiction, prompting recommendations for therapy or rehab. The segment concluded with well-wishes for the callers, particularly regarding maintaining sobriety during the holidays, followed by a cynical comment from Jim Norton.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Gregorio!  I'm Antonio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Oh yeah.  How's everybody?  Very good.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  A little tuckered.  A little tuckered.  You know, we're talking about being tuckered.  Oh my God.  Want to match stories right now?  Sounded like a nightmare.  Fuck!  I went to bed at 11. 
[00:00:30]  Over at the Hughes Vomitorium.  I got sick kids.  The one kid just got better and the young one is now sick with what the son had there.  Just a vomit super soaker.  So, I was sleeping in the other room last night to get a good night's sleep.  And I went to bed at 11 and at 12.50 my wife walks in and she goes, I need your help.  Oh boy.  I'm like, what?  And you just jump up immediately as a parent. 
[00:01:00]  Like, what the fuck?  What's up?  There's puke all over my wife.  My little one is just fucking power booting.  Oh, jeez.  I thought she finally realized who she was married to.  12.50.  So, then I find myself in a complete haze giving my daughter a bath to get the puke out of her hair.  Oh my God.  And like, what in the morning?  I'm just like, washing her off.  I'm like, is this real?  Like, what is that?  What am I doing?  I felt like dentist kid.  Is this real life? 
[00:01:30]  And then, uh, and then, uh, my wife goes, I got it from here.  I'm like, oh God, thank God.  I put in my little time and I, I wandered back into, into the room to sleep.  And then at around four, the crying was so bad because the kid is just miserable with  103 fever, a fucking cough.  Oh my God.  And then I got up and then I'm in a daze, just kind of brushing the little one's hair  softly.  And it actually worked and it put her to sleep.  And then I went back and just stared at the clock until it was time to officially get 
[00:02:00]  up.  It's like, oh, this is great.  I got to be up in a fucking few minutes.  Oh, morning radio and having two young kids just doesn't fucking.  It doesn't match up, man.  It doesn't match up.  Jeez Louise.  I need a break.  Do you get angry?  Even though like, you know, you know that you can't.  Not really.  It's just like one of those things you gotta do.  You get frustrated inside, but, um, you don't get angry at the kids really.  Not really.  No. 
[00:02:30]  But then yesterday, but it started yesterday around five o'clock because I went out to  get a Christmas tree with my, my young son.  Cause he started to feel better.  Cause I was waiting for him to get better.  Cause you know, go through the whole thing with him.  It'll be a cool little father, son thing to do.  And, uh, I, I leave the apartment around five and he's out cold in a stroller.  So then I just wandered around the neighborhood.  I got a vegetable juice and I talked to my cell phone guy cause I still don't have the S4,  which is stupid.  And now I'm in this, uh, no man's land where I could get the S4, but there might be a new 
[00:03:00]  Samsung, uh, coming out around the corner supposedly.  But he hasn't really heard about it, but he says at CES, maybe they'll announce it.  So he thinks something will be, uh, released by March and they're talking about maybe a  curved screen.  So I'm having this conversation with him while my kid's snoozing and then I get him home  and then he's screaming bloody murder cause he's saying his ear hurts from the cold.  Right.  So I can't get my doctor on the phone. 
[00:03:30]  That's why Dr. Steve is like, he fucking rules as much as we beat the shit out of him.  And I personally beat the shit out of him.  I love the guy cause he's what doctors should be where you can get them on the phone immediately.  Like I have to go through my doctor's office and you have to tell him what's wrong with  your kid.  And then they eventually get back to you.  You don't talk to a doctor.  You give the info.  And then when the doctor might maybe has a few minutes, they'll call you back.  Maybe your doctor's busy with some radio show.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve's like patients are all pissed off cause they can't get to him. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe your doctor hasn't killed his patients.  Dr. Steve has.  He's got nothing else to do.  Oh, look, I'm forking.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve's patients, you know.  Yes.  They don't really don't need his help.  Not really.  No.  I'm just waiting for him to hold our hand and open the window so the soul can leave.  Oh, yes.  Just ordering more satin pillows.  What was that dumb commercial?  Not tonight.  Oh.  Not tonight.  Dolores or whatever the fuck her name was.  Leave the window open.  Cause it's a tradition when someone dies, you gotta leave the window open so their soul leaves.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  I think that soul shit will figure it out.  He'll find some kind of crevice to get out of your fucking rotting home.  Banging on the window.  Yeah.  So the kid is like crying bad and he's like, my ear hurts, my ear hurts.  And one of the worst things a kid could have is an earache.  It's like a fucking nightmare for them.  So I, uh, I called Dr. Steve.  He goes, you get these over-the-counter fucking, uh, eardrops.  So I run, I mean, I run to CBS cause I don't want this kid in pain.  Uh.  The things you'll do for your kid when he's fucking crying and in pain. 
[00:05:00]  So I get up there and I, I find these eardrops and I bring them home and you have to take  them orally.  What?  For, for ear.  For ear?  So I go, what the fuck is this shit?  So I call up Dr. Steve and he goes, that's horse shit.  He goes, the pharmacy, the pharmacies know that's horse shit.  Why are they still fucking, you know, selling that?  Cause it's some kind of, uh, homeopathic.  Oh.  Basically it's some kind of sort of aspirin thing.  So that's kind of will help the ear ache. 
[00:05:30]  But you can take Tylenol for that.  You need shit that gets dropped in them ears, right?  So yeah.  So he goes, I'll, I'll call you in something.  I have no problem calling in something.  I go, thank you, Dr. Steve.  So then I, I run back to CBS and you know how cold it was.  It was like 25 fucking 26 degrees.  With a little wind blowing and black ice all over the place.  Oh shit.  Black ice.  I'm slip sliding away.  I was driving in this morning thinking of black ice and a laughing noise. 
[00:06:00]  I know.  I should have called the local precinct to see where the black ice was.  I could slip while you're walking.  Right.  So I run back to CBS and, and now, now I'm in the nightmare that we've all been in.  There's, there's the drop off line and there's the pickup line.  God, the people at the pharmacy.  And I tweeted about it.  I mean, getting behind an old person at a pharmacy is like I tweeted.  That's the definition of fucking hell.  Now am I covered with, they want to know prices. 
[00:06:30]  They want to know side effects.  If you live to, this lady had to be in her late seventies.  Just take the fucking medicine.  Take it and fucking go home.  What do you mean side effects?  And is there a generic brand?  Now, should I call my provider?  My daughter told me that I should ask you about, and you're standing there like, I could be done in three minutes.  I'm on high alert when I'm in public.  I never want to be in anyone's fucking way when I'm in a store. 
[00:07:00]  Or when, when I pay for my shit, I quickly take that step to the right and put all my shit back together.  Right.  I don't sit there and, and, and, and redo everything right in front of the cashier while there's a line behind me.  So I go to the, uh, I go to the pickup line cause I got a, I got a prescription that was called in and I wait.  I'm only four.  I'm only four behind.  Uh huh.  It took at least 15 minutes with, and 15 minutes in a fucking pharmacy.  You know the deal, man.  That's brutal. 
[00:07:30]  Eternity.  You think your time is just being wasted?  Oh my God.  It's like, it's like 20 minutes in an airport.  You know how like the time literally just stops when you're in, when you're in an airport, even though your flight's leaving in 20 minutes, that 20 minutes seems like hours.  So I finally get to the counter.  Oh, your kid, you've never got him a prescription.  So he's not in the system.  I'm like, okay.  All right.  What does that mean?  I'm ready to go.  Well, you have to go to the drop off line.  And I look at the drop off line and that has five or six people. 
[00:08:00]  Oh my God.  And, and the one lady was holding up everybody with her fucking questions.  And we're all looking at each other like, fuck, let's kill this lady.  So then I go to the drop off guy, finally.  And, and now he's asking me a million fucking questions.  I'm like, can't he, I'm in the system.  Can't he just add his name to my shit?  Cause he doesn't pay for any of this.  Yeah.  Oh, we can't do that.  We got to do this individually.  What's his social security.  I don't fucking know.  I'm going to call my wife for that.  What's he working? 
[00:08:30]  What's his birthday for a second?  I didn't know that.  Oh, wow.  Cause now I'm frazzled.  So finally the, they, I get in the system and like, all right, that'll be 20 minutes.  And now I have to sit fucking, I'm like, are you fucking, what?  So then I finally get the, the official eardrops that'll take care of the earache.  And I run all the way home.  And he's like, did you wee, wee, wee all the way home?  All the way home.  Fucking worried about that black ice again.  Oh, you got to look out.  Did you see any police officers that you could have inquired as to? 
[00:09:00]  I wish I could have fucking pulled the police guy over.  Where's the black ice?  That's right.  It's helpful information.  I don't know if there's been any reports of spin outs.  Black ice.  I love that.  And then I get home and now the kid is out cold.  He's, he's sleeping heavily.  So I'm like, you know what?  If he's sleeping heavily, let's let him fucking sleep.  Cause you never want to wake a fucking sleeping kid.  I think most people know that.  Long story short, he wakes up.  I got the eardrops that were a major fucking hassle to get after getting the homeopathic fucking oral shit. 
[00:09:30]  And then, uh, I go, all right, you know, how's your earache?  You know, no earache.  He's totally fine.  Oh boy.  He's totally fine.  Which goes back to my original thought about the whole thing.  I thought it was just stupid cold air.  Cold air in that.  That'll fucking hurt.  But I guess, I guess you can't just assume that.  Kid's eardrum is like a fucking rolling paper.  Yeah, exactly.  Kid's shit gets fucking.  But after all that, he doesn't need the eardrops. 
[00:10:00]  I was like, you remember the other day I was talking about that imaginary fight thing.  I started doing that again in my, in my foyer.  Like I'm fighting in the invisible man.  Cause you don't know what to do with all this energy and frustration.  So you just start like doing weird shit with your body.  All that you did.  And you're probably just thinking I could have been sleeping.  I don't know anything, but he would have, you should have made him take the eardrops just in case.  Just in case.  No, you should have just told him that.  Oh.  Just in case.  Just so I feel better about it. 
[00:10:30]  Just so you feel like you're in the relationship.  You're taking it.  You're taking it.  And then, you know, the, the wake up with the little one with the, the vomit everywhere.  Vomit.  That's great.  So why are you tired, Jimmy?  I had to come late.  It was late.  I had to blow a lawn.  I had to come late.  You had to make comesies.  Oh my God.  I was asleep.  Yeah.  Oh.  Fuck.  Whatever.  Well, little Beavis is at the vet. 
[00:11:00]  He has his balls cut off yesterday.  Did you feel a little lonely last night?  Oh, it was pretty lonely.  I'd go to the fridge and, uh, and I, when I shut the fridge door, I'd look down to make  sure, you know, he was not there.  And then I realized, oh, he's just not going to be there.  Oh boy.  Because, you know, little Beavis is, like, he comes home today though.  You're, uh.  Probably a little limpy.  You're attached to the Beavs.  Oh, the little Beav.  You're attached to the Beavs.  Of course.  Yeah.  He's, he's a little cat. 
[00:11:30]  Right.  Very, very good news for the people.  We met, uh, the CEO of Sirius XM.  Hey, we certainly did.  Wow, as he had no nonsense guy.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  He is, uh, all about, I tell you one thing, if you're a stockholder of this company, be  happy.  You're in good hands.  He is all about this company.  Dude, his office was like Pacino's and Devil's Advocate.  Yeah, yes.  There was just nothing in it.  Nothing.  It was just a blank table and him and it was cold. 
[00:12:00]  No windows.  Nothing in there.  Nothing that proves he's an actual human being.  Nothing distracts him from this company and the works that must be done.  He might be a cyborg.  Yes.  He might be a cyborg.  I don't know.  He's all about this company and making money for this company.  Without getting into details, because, uh, quite frankly, he scared the shit out of all  of us.  Uh, man, his opening line was terrific.  It was supposed to be a, hey, uh, you know, let's get to know each other a little bit meeting. 
[00:12:30]  Uh-huh.  And he looks at Tim Saban and goes, all right, Tim, so what is this about?  Oh, I know.  When this, when we weren't even in trouble, it was supposed to be a little, hey, how you  doing?  And then, uh, you guys might have to help me with exactly what he said, but he pretty  much said, I don't care if I ever see you guys again, and I'm sure you feel the same about  me.  About meeting you.  He goes, uh, you know, I look, you do your show.  All right.  I'm not going to tell you what's funny.  You know, it's funny.  I do this and look, you didn't, yeah, you don't care about meeting me. 
[00:13:00]  I didn't care if I met you.  I felt like, I felt like he, he felt about us the same way Gunnery Sergeant Hartman felt  about that donut.  Just kind of, uh, but you, but that's a no nonsense guy.  Oh yeah.  Instead of that, you know, that BS crap, because you know, we don't get along with the guys  upstairs and they don't get along with us.  We're in two completely different worlds, but we work for the same company to make it  work.  Cause he even said, he goes, you know, I do a lot of things way better than you guys. 
[00:13:30]  And you guys definitely do, you know, uh, uh, uh, one thing I think you might say, one  thing way better than I do.  I don't know your business and you certainly don't know mine.  Certainly.  And he did say one thing to you.  That's where I'm kind of glad that he had no idea who I, cause I asked a question and  he, he, he did come back to it, but he blew right past it.  Cause I know he's thinking, who is this person?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  He's, he wanted to finish what he was talking about first.  Jimmy pipes up and he's like, yeah, pretty much. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Shut up.  He put the hand up and I, he kept going, but then he asked, cause he said to you two at  the end, I was so happy.  He goes, uh, and for you two, uh, if you hear anything around here and you hear that, uh,  that I'm concerned with it, pay attention.  You two.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, it's like, who is this guy?  Meaning I guess somebody had fucked up.  So he was basically saying that somebody didn't heed his warning or didn't heed the warning  that it was bothering the CEO.  So he was basically saying, if you hear that it's bothering me, pay attention to that shit.  Yeah.  Cause I guess, I guess they got rid of somebody. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  For still.  I just want to do some, um, somebody that I don't know.  I don't even know who the guy was.  I don't do it.  I want to do the low altitude flying around here.  You know what they call under the radar.  You didn't explain the app though.  Yeah.  I was very happy.  I mean, uh, the app's definitely going to be a problem for, for a little longer, but  they're, uh, putting a lot of money into it and they're figuring it out.  It's a whole thing, but he's very aware of it.  And he, he didn't blow past it and push it off on Tim Sabian or Scott.  He goes, we are working on it. 
[00:15:00]  We know it's a problem.  Apparently the problem was that Mel went to fucking, went to Ted's app emporium instead  of, uh, well, each individual person can enjoy it at once, but no more than one at a  time.  Well, IP delivery wasn't as important as it is nowadays.  Right.  But I asked a question and he looks right at me.  He goes, you don't think I'm aware of the app?  I'm like, oh fuck.  Okay.  Sorry, sir.  Sorry, sorry.  Don't you think I know that? 
[00:15:30]  Sorry, sir.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  This is at the Alpha 5.  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.  He didn't go for my casualness.  Like when he walked in, I went, Jimmy, and I threw my arms open for a big hug.  Well, my favoritest part of the whole meeting was Jimmy's bomb.  Oh, yeah.  It didn't give me a try.  Jimmy tried.  A little levity.  Just a little levity.  What was it?  This guy was impervious to levity.  Right.  Yeah.  It was talking about self-deprecation about the show. 
[00:16:00]  Yes, it said something about I'm better at this.  Yeah.  Like what I was saying.  Better at this.  And you're better at what you do, the show, than I would be.  And Jimmy was like, no, you'd probably be better than we are.  All right.  Yeah.  And he couldn't have been more.  He did not care one iota about you.  And maybe it literally is an indicator of how my career has gone.  But it didn't faze me or surprise me.  Oh, it was great.  You weren't supposed to get a laugh in that situation.  No, it was okay. 
[00:16:30]  You could have had the greatest joke ever.  You were going to get a zero.  Yeah.  You got to fucking pepper one out there, though.  You got to try, right?  You gave it a whirl.  But he was fine, though.  I like he was just no bullshit guy.  Oh, yeah.  But let's turn our attention to the great Tim Sabian, who surprises us with the meeting  yesterday with the CEO.  Yeah, nothing I like more than a surprise meeting, I'll tell you that much.  See, I haven't shaved in two months.  I had a fucking dirty t-shirt on yesterday.  He looks like fucking Jeremiah Johnson. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  Walking up there.  He just needed the bear coat.  I had shitty jeans that kind of might have been a little funky yesterday, because I  decided I'd maybe go one more day with the jeans when I probably shouldn't.  You look like you were living in the magic bus in Alaska for two months.  Yeah, I know.  You would think Tim would go, hey, man, heads up.  I'm going to take you upstairs tomorrow.  Because believe it or not, I would have shaved for that meeting.  I would have put on a collared shirt.  I would have found my best pair of jeans.  And I would have put on some kind of like black booty thing. 
[00:17:30]  Sure.  Because those guys are all about fucking presentation.  Uh-huh.  You get a little more respect if you dress the part.  Yeah.  We look like slobs.  And that's because Sabian didn't give us the heads up.  He didn't give us heads up.  He was standing outside the studio for the last like 15 minutes of yesterday's show.  And I didn't know.  Right.  I didn't know.  You know me.  I'm zipping up fucking bag.  I'm fucking putting my coat on.  I'm ready to go.  You're ready to get the fuck out of here.  I'm ready to go. 
[00:18:00]  And then there he is.  Hey, we're going to go upstairs and then upstairs, we're all in the elevator with little small talk.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  Am I not a fan of small talk?  Yeah.  That's really strange being upstairs.  And then we're parading through the hallways looking at people that I didn't even know exist.  No.  I do not like that upstairs floor.  And I've been there twice.  I've never been there in all the years we've worked here.  Oh, really?  And then I've been there twice in the past like week. 
[00:18:30]  And you wonder what all those people do.  What do they do?  Who the hell knows?  You just need us.  Yeah.  I've gone up there now.  What are they all doing?  What do they do?  What is Kenny taking up there for?  What are they called?  The people that...  Butt fucking.  No.  What are they called?  They stamp shit for you.  A notary republic.  Oh, okay.  What went up there is a notary republic.  It says the public, not re-public.  Notary public.  It's notary public.  No.  I thought you said notary republic.  No.  Notary public.  Oh, okay.  And a notary whatever she is. 
[00:19:00]  And I'll have them up there for that.  But it's really creepy.  It looks just like downstairs, but with zero personality and a lot of potential to be fired.  Yes.  Yes.  Can't we all have that job?  Don't you just need a stamp?  And then you stamp and then you sign it.  I think that's it.  Yeah, what the fuck?  The dumb little stamp and then they initial it or something.  And they take it very seriously.  They watch you sign stuff.  Oh, okay.  I saw you sign it.  They pull out their little case.  Oh, let me flip this open where my little ink is.  And now I'll sign it because I'm special. 
[00:19:30]  I've been knighted.  An eyewitness ID.  You need ID.  Oh, I know.  Whatever.  Sign it.  A notary of the republic.  Yes, notary of the republic.  Yeah, the floor layout is the same up there as it is down here by the offices, but it's  just a different vibe.  Well, they're making sure their area looks nice first.  Oh, the carpeting.  It looks beautiful up there.  Yeah.  It's a shithole down here.  But he actually made me laugh at one point because his way of doing things is a little different  than Mel.  We've worked for Mel for fuck off and on for, I don't even know, at least 10 years. 
[00:20:00]  How do I even know you are the CEO, Mel?  And Mel, one of Mel's philosophy is that he doesn't like make everything all nice because  it's radio.  Like he goes, the listeners don't give a fuck if you have new carpet or new studios.  He doesn't care.  So he doesn't put a lot into that part of the business.  And the new CEO goes, he kind of hinted that was Mel's way without trashing Mel.  And he was also hinting that he does things a little differently and wants to take a little 
[00:20:30]  pride in where he works and stuff.  And he said he was sick of seeing the cleaning lady stopping the vacuum every five minutes  because the carpet was raveling into the vacuum cleaner.  Yeah, the fucking strands from the carpet were getting tangled in the vacuum.  Because, you know, there was a bit of neglect as far as, you know.  Aesthetics around here.  And the visual of that kind of made me laugh.  That the poor cleaning lady probably had to take hours to clean the carpet when it should 
[00:21:00]  have taken a quick hour, maybe.  Yeah.  And he didn't want us going up there and wasting his time.  And he's like, if you have these ideas, you run it through Tim and he'll get it to me.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He made sure that there were buffers.  A lot of buffers.  A lot of buffers.  Yeah, buffers.  He didn't want any of our nonsense.  He didn't want that little tepid knock at the door in the two days.  Do you remember me, Mr. Myers?  You know, do you have a minute we can chat?  Those are the type of guys you'd never want to see.  Because when you see them, you're in deep trouble. 
[00:21:30]  That's what we learned over the years.  They're all stock guys.  Zero to do with day-to-day shit.  It's all stock.  It's all stock.  It's all about the stock, the stockholders, and the fucking profits.  Well, last year, around this time, I went up to say goodbye to Mel and just thank him.  I fucking brown-nosed my ass.  Went up there and just thanked him for everything he's done for us.  Me personally and the show.  Must have been a very quick meeting.  Thanks for everything you've done.  It was strangely weird. 
[00:22:00]  It was kind of cool, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah, because there was no pressure because he knew he wasn't going to be the boss anymore.  Yeah.  And I just thanked him and we shook hands and he said, keep in touch.  And that was it.  Do you keep in touch?  No.  How do you keep in touch?  I don't know.  I don't have his stuff.  I only got his cell right there uncomfortably.  Look at his cell.  All right.  Yeah, give me your number.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, maybe we could do lunch.  Do you know how bad it is?  Hey, they're wearing Christmas sweaters on TV.  Oh, boy.  Ugly Christmas sweaters is the fun thing to do this year.  It is, isn't it? 
[00:22:30]  If you're a disgusting hipster.  ...sweater, an ugly Christmas sweater that could win one of your contests.  I guess if you're wearing it to be serious, it's festive.  But if you're wearing it out to a party and you know you're not sure you're supposed to walk out of the house wearing it.  Your head looks like a dick.  It's ugly.  Is it your belief, guys, that some people make these sweaters to be ugly?  Or is this a designer that just did not get it off and you realize I've got to capitalize on this?  Yeah, we had a guy at a mall that, like, fucking, basically was executed yesterday. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're talking about ugly sweaters.  Yeah, it's great.  Starting off with his wife, his new wife.  They got married two years ago.  That story's just...  30 years old.  A fucking productive member of society.  Two lawyers, yeah.  Taken out by some fucking pieces of shit that will never be anything but a burden.  Short Hills Mall, that's like a high-end place, man.  Of course.  They know where the goods are.  You've got to watch.  If you're a person fucking shopping and you're walking out to your car, you've got to fucking be alert. 
[00:23:30]  I mean, the odds that anything is going to happen are very, very slim.  But it does happen.  Right.  And you're there, it's this time of year, everyone knows it, you're going out with, like, probably more than you normally would.  Right.  You know, you're not paying a lot of attention.  It's, you know, that's the fucking, that's the lake on the Serengeti where the fucking zebras and antelope are fucking getting a drink.  And if you're walking into a really nice car, that's it.  Makes you even more of a target.  I mean, if they're hiding, there's only so much you could do, but you could do enough where, you know, keep your head on a swivel, kind of look around, stay in the, if you can't, if no cars are coming, you stay in the middle of the lane where the thing is, not next to a car where you can be jumped out at. 
[00:24:00]  Just look around.  I don't know all the details yet, but, I mean, you know, fuck, you just give up your shit.  Well, what happened was he had let his wife, these fucking savages had been riding around the, I guess, looking for someone to fucking assault, because, like you said, they're just valueless.  And the woman, he let his wife in the car, and she gets in, they had armfuls of presents, so she gets in the passenger side, and then the one guy, I guess, stayed in the truck, and then the one guy confronts him with a gun. 
[00:24:30]  And they said this guy wasn't stupid, like, he wasn't the type that would have been playing the hero, but he probably got into it with the guy because he knew his wife was in the car.  His wife was in the vehicle, I mean.  So, he fucking struggled, I guess the guy fired four shots, killed him, and then the guy gets in the truck with the gun and orders the wife out of the car.  Would have been nice if he was able to, you know, pull a gun out himself and shoot these fuckers before they shot him, but it's Jersey, and of course you need a good reason to have a gun. 
[00:25:00]  I think he had a good reason.  It's a little late, but that was a good enough reason.  Fucking assholes telling you how you should defend yourself and your property and your fucking wife and everything.  You're just out there as a victim, while the people that don't pay attention to the laws are armed to the hilt.  You know, that really is.  They just keep you away from protecting your family.  It's hard to argue that because, like, as much as the guns drive me crazy sometimes, like, in a time like this, how do you justify that? 
[00:25:30]  Like, you can't go to the state and go, like, someday me and my wife will be out and we might get fucking assaulted.  Right, right.  They don't want to hear it and you can't, you know, and again, like I said, I'm not a nut enough to think that this happens all the time.  It is a rare occurrence.  I'm not, you know, with this fear monger, oh, no, everyone's out to get me or, you know, you or anything.  But it does happen.  It does happen.  The same people that go, oh, well, you know, it doesn't happen that often. 
[00:26:00]  They're the same people that are going to play fucking Mega Millions tonight with the odds of two hundred and fucking ninety million to one.  They'll play it because it might happen.  You got to be in it to win it.  I might win.  But then the odds that you're going to get robbed are a lot better than that.  You have a better chance of what happens to this guy than winning the Mega Millions.  But they're the same people that'll be like, well, you don't need a gun.  It never happens.  It wouldn't.  So don't play fucking Mega Millions.  I heard on the news you have a better shot at getting hit by a comet. 
[00:26:30]  Yes.  They actually said that.  People have been hit by comet debris and killed.  But that can't be true because there will be a person or two that wins Mega Millions.  And I don't remember the last time anyone got hit by a comet.  Maybe they mean the product.  Yeah.  Drunken household.  Well, the news just has to be silly with the odds.  Of course.  They love those odds.  Do you play numbers or do you let them do it randomly?  If I play a number like this, I'll let them do it because I'm like, I just don't know.  Quick picks.  You got a quick pick. 
[00:27:00]  It doesn't matter, right?  Most of the time it's a quick pick that wins it, right?  Yeah.  When it's big like this, I usually go in and I'm like, hand the guy like a hundred dollar  bill and just go, give me a hundred dollars of quick picks.  Because I think most people, when they pick their numbers, they feel like they got to spread  them out.  Yeah.  And that quick pick will fuck you up and go, all right, you got a seven and an eight.  You're like, I would have never picked a seven and an eight.  That's stupid.  And then the numbers come in and it's like 35, 36, 37.  You're like, I wouldn't have picked that.  But you got to spread it around.  I got to get one in the 20s, something in the teens. 
[00:27:30]  That's why I think quick pick is way fucking better.  Well, here's how it works with numbers.  Okay.  This is a Craig's conundrum, but it's true.  If you have a quarter, you flip it a hundred times and it cups up tails.  On the hundredth and first time, what are the odds that it will come up heads?  It's still 50.  I must have done that one already.  You're dead.  But the balls don't know that they're not supposed to be lined up.  The balls.  No, they don't. 
[00:28:00]  It's all about the balls.  The balls.  They have no idea.  They don't know the 21, 22.  To us, it seems weird.  Yeah.  But you're right.  Sometimes they come out in a clump.  Yeah.  1, 7, 58, 59, 60, 61.  Well, that's our idea of randomness, of picking random numbers.  Like the human's idea of randomness is not random.  No, of course not.  It's very calculated.  You're looking at it thinking, this is what random would look like, which all of a sudden  has some type of structure to it.  So it's very hard to actually be random. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  I'm going to play, though.  I'll play.  I'll play.  I'll play with it.  They're hinting it could hit a billion.  That's if it goes till Friday.  Right.  But I think someone will win.  Yeah.  I'm going to win today.  You get that many people playing now.  You're going to win?  Yeah.  You'll know if I win, too.  But I won't announce it.  Don't say it.  Why?  Well, you would say it as a...  All right.  Go ahead.  Say it.  What am I going to do when I come into work?  Oh, you're actually going to come to work.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, okay.  I love work.  But I'm going to have a little bit of a different attitude.  Oh, will you?  A new attitude. 
[00:29:00]  I'm going to be nude, just shitting everywhere as I walk like a fucking pony.  That would be great.  You'll say, wow, he must have hit the quick pick.  And I'm walking down the hall smiling, just shitting like a pony.  That would be the funniest thing I'd ever seen in my life.  If I looked over, Jim's naked, just shitting on the floor.  As I'm walking in on my phone.  So, bye.  So, bye.  It's like, oh, you won?  And you go, look, won what?  Did I realize that the numbers are off?  I only won $40.  The reason I said don't... 
[00:29:30]  You're cleaning up your own shit out there before the manager comes in.  Spraying the wall.  Embarrassing.  The reason I said don't say it, because they actually, on CNN, they were doing a Mega Millions story.  The same dunce that was doing the comment thing.  Yeah.  Said, and I just want to let everyone know, this is, they thought this was great TV.  I just want to let everyone know, if I win the Mega Millions, I won't be here on Monday.  And they all had a good laugh about it.  Oh, you're crazy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:30:00]  So dopey.  What news people think is humor is just fucking...  Yeah.  Blows my mind.  Yeah.  They were talking about the snow.  We're going to get another three inches, I guess.  I guess three inches.  It's thought about us coming in.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It happens.  They had John Montone.  It kind of happens in December, January, and February.  Sometimes in March.  Just want to let the people know that.  Yeah.  Don't be surprised.  It's going to happen a few more times.  Yeah.  John Montone was out there. 
[00:30:30]  And it's like, I'm here with Washuba, the cab driver.  And it's the same thing.  So, what do you think?  Another storm coming.  Very good.  I make money.  People don't do budget.  Ha, ha.  That's right.  Maka Kishoni.  Maka Kishoni.  He was probably proud that he could pronounce his name properly.  Oh, yeah.  That John Montone is a card.  He certainly is.  What?  What?  What?  It's just a sexual, sorry, just a sexual assault description. 
[00:31:00]  The unidentified man was wearing a blue hat with ear flaps, gloves, and a black leather jacket, police said.  He's described as six foot three with a muscular build, facial acne, and tattoos on his upper neck and chest.  How about, um, can we cut down the description by maybe 80, 88 percent?  That's amazing.  I don't understand it.  Especially when they use clothing.  I mean.  Clothing's the dumbest thing to put in a description.  Let's just take off the clothing.  Unless it just happened.  When I start, like, committing crimes, I'm going to get, like, stuff I would never wear that's a size too fucking small or a size too fucking big. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  And then when I'm done with my crime, I'm throwing that shit away.  Like them ugly-ass Bruno Mali shoes.  Exactly.  That was why the OJ thing was the dumbest thing to me.  They fucked up with the glove, but I guess supposedly he had a, uh, uh, you know, um, a plastic glove on underneath it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they fucked up that by not telling him to take that off or at least saying, hey, maybe it's not fitting because of what, you know, he has that glove on already. 
[00:32:00]  Uh-huh.  But then wouldn't you, wouldn't you, like, as a lawyer go, well, who's to say he would have a perfectly fitting glove?  Yeah, of course you're going to wear shit that wouldn't fit or.  I would, I would wear a size 13 shoes if I was committing a crime.  Giant shoes.  It'd be sort of a pain in the ass, but at least, at least it would help you out.  Yeah.  When, when you leave those footprints around, have your lawyer talking all that shit up to the jury and look at the shoes don't even match. 
[00:32:30]  Why would you, why would you wear your fucking regular shoes?  Of course not.  What a blunder that was by Chris Darden.  What a blunder that was.  Stupid.  Oh, and then just to accept that the glove wasn't fitting without saying something, they all were just staring like, oh my God, that was supposed to fit.  OJ's face is crazy.  He's like, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. 
[00:33:00]  But they, they're kind of on.  Enough.  Enough would have stabbed somebody.  That's all you would need.  Exactly.  They gave the jury in that moment exactly what they needed.  Oh yeah.  But they never pointed, I don't remember them pointing out that OJ was wearing those plastic fucking gloves underneath.  Yeah.  They did after, not in the moment.  Not in the moment, right?  Yeah, it was in the damage control. 
[00:33:30]  Right.  They're like, oh, we're going to get the murderer with the gloves on and the jury's going to say, oh, shit.  Look at OJ's face.  He's loving it.  Like, look at this glove.  This glove ain't fixed.  Look at this.  He's like, you must have quit.  Oh, look at it.  The love don't fit.  You must have quit.  Look at that face he's got.  I loved it.  He goes, oh, man, they ain't going to fit.  What's better than a good fucking court case on TV when everybody's all into it and every day goes by and you're watching and new shit's being introduced? 
[00:34:00]  I love a good real life trial.  And Joey in Jersey, he brings up another good point.  I know the OJ thing is a very old fucking story, but it still tickles our fans.  Of course.  He says the glove didn't fit because he was holding it weird.  Yeah.  Remember, he was like, he was like sort of making gang signs underneath the gloves.  He was making arthritis fingers like all crunchy and made it harder to put the glove on.  You could make it look like you're having a lot of trouble putting a glove on. 
[00:34:30]  Yes.  I mean, really.  That's why those lawyers were so stupid.  Just dummies.  Fucking idiots.  They know that was so important.  Why wouldn't you slow it down and go, all right, look, everyone saw how he's trying to put this glove on.  That's not how you put gloves on.  He's got plastic gloves underneath.  So, judge, that could be a problem.  Can we talk to you in the back office there and try to figure out a better way for him to try this glove on?  They should have had like a cast of OJ's hand made and like the defense then says, this is an actual exact replica of OJ's hand and have it look like the fingers are completely straight. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  Get some mannequin company.  Like wax it.  Right.  Make it all nice and slippery.  It's all shiny like a big chrome hand.  Right.  And the glove just falls on it.  Absolutely.  But no, OJ's, yeah, like you said, throwing up gang signs.  Well, look, it's like kind of crooked and...  He's trying to put a glove on while making the OK sign. 
[00:35:30]  That was a good one.  Oh, CNBC had a little fuck up there, I see, huh?  Did they?  What?  Naughty language?  Oh, yeah.  Naughty?  Were they being naughty?  Naughty, naughty!  I do love a good naughty language, bitch.  Who's saying naughty, naughty?  Naughty, naughty!  I'm going to go with...  T-T-T-T-T-T-Ease Me!  John Parr.  Da-na-na-na-na!  So I got it?  Oh, wow.  You did.  I think you're right.  Give me a little naughty, naughty! 
[00:36:00]  Naughty, naughty!  I did get this one.  Fuck.  John Parr.  Little ladies video.  Look at this guy.  He's naughty, naughty.  This song was great.  This is a guilty pleasure.  What a horrible version this is.  Can we find a better version?  Find a better version!  John Parr.  Come on!  Deserves a little respect.  I'm so surprised he's not going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  And let me tell you something, Sam Roberts making a fucking face.  It beats that Beyonce fucking girly shit you're listening to. 
[00:36:30]  You fruit.  Go take a dick in your mouth.  That's right.  Why should Sam be rewarded?  It's the second VH1 Classics video that we watched this week.  Yeah, well, this is what we're doing in 2014.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  He's welding.  He's welding some shit like a man.  That's what men do.  That's a man with his mullet.  Hey, wait a minute.  It's the same car from J-J-J-Julie.  It is.  J-J-Julie.  It's a Rolls Royce.  John Parr. 
[00:37:00]  I think he ripped off this fucking...  Uh-oh.  Listen, John.  I'm not paying you to funnel the car.  I'm paying you to fix it.  Now get on with it.  He just told the boss to go, fuck himself.  He's like, you know what?  Take this job and shove it.  Yeah.  Pause.  Pause.  Pause.  He's supposed to be a man's man in this video.  Did you see how he flipped that glove?  He flips it like a...  There was a little mystery there.  Oh, yeah.  Very... 
[00:37:30]  Can you go back to that?  Very effeminate.  What a femmy throw that was.  Whoa.  Watch the throw.  Watch.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Now he's in his 60 fucking...  65 Mustang.  He's mulling in the wind.  Yeah.  He's got a chick in the car.  Yeah.  He's touching her knee. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  I think he'll do the walk-in.  Oh.  She looks familiar.  I've seen her in other videos.  Yeah.  She's probably dead.  Aw.  A video vixen.  She looks like Liza Minnelli or something.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Renna.  Ah.  Is that...  Is it?  It could be.  It might be Renna.  Is that Lisa Renna?  Naughty Naughty Naughty.  Find out if Lisa Renna was in the Naughty Naughty video. 
[00:38:30]  After we hear the whole song.  Oh, God.  I want to hear all this goodness.  I've been squeezing my life.  Would you get his autograph on your arm tattooed?  No, I wouldn't get his autograph.  No?  Why?  There wouldn't be a Jack White if there wasn't a John Parr.  John Parr has to be right under Jack White.  That's right.  He had literally zero influence on Jack White's career.  Ah, ha, ha.  Look, he's fucking...  He's in a hotel room, and they're just... 
[00:39:00]  Do you think this is just a fantasy, though?  Like J-J-J-Julia?  Could be.  I think J-J-J-Julia, I think he stole this whole concept from John Parr.  From John Parr.  I bet he has no idea who John Parr is.  Including the mystery.  I don't know.  Yeah, well, that is a little mysterious.  This could be the first time.  That's a fucking riff, Sam Roberts. 
[00:39:30]  This is child of the 80s shit right here.  Is it?  Yes, it is.  Wow, he doesn't know how to hold a guitar.  Well, he's rocking.  Oh, he's rocking.  Look, he's in the...  He's in the Rolls.  He's in San Francisco.  I don't know.  I think this is J-J-Julia.  He might be on the wrong side of town.  Oh, boy.  Yes, it is Frisco.  It is Frisco.  Oh, boy.  Going to a bathhouse.  Uh-oh. 
[00:40:00]  Back to the welding?  No?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Now we're just looking at a cool video.  No, we're not.  So fucking cool.  Look at that.  This rocks.  An American flag guitar.  This would definitely be put under the This Sucks column.  Naughty Naughty.  It means she does it.  Oof.  You don't like this one?  No.  I don't love the Beyonce either, but this is rough to defend. 
[00:40:30]  Dan-an-an-an.  God, this is such an 80s video.  Oh, it really is.  Sam, just turn it a bit so I can enjoy with you.  Oh, yeah.  Are you enjoying this?  No.  I want to see if this is just a fantasy.  That looks like Lisa Renna.  That might be a young Lisa Renna.  It does.  Of course, she was fucking famous.  Dan-an-an-an.  We're going to find out in a minute.  We better find out.  We're going to find out about John Parr.  These special effects aren't very special.  Right.  Yeah, it was San Francisco, right?  Oh, the car's flying away. 
[00:41:00]  It's flying.  Like in Greece.  Wow.  That happened.  That's a great special effect right there.  Yeah, it was really flying.  That's great.  Sure did.  I'm glad we fucking listened to that.  What's John Parr up to these days?  Is that Lisa Renna?  Right.  And was that his only hit?  What was the other John Parr hit?  Right.  John Parr still got his mullet?  He did St. Elmo's Fire.  Oh, that's right.  St. Elmo's Fire.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And we listened to Naughty Naughty. 
[00:41:30]  Dan-an-an-an.  Well, yeah.  Naughty Naughty sucks.  If it wasn't for Naughty Naughty,  he would have never got that call to do St. Elmo's Fire.  And it is Lisa Renna.  Oh, thank you, Mr. Fishman.  It was.  Lisa Renna.  Holy shit.  She was fucking cute.  And now she's fucking doing diaper commercials.  That's wonderful.  With Botox face.  Naughty Naughty.  You peed your pants.  Ch-ch-ch-ch-change me.  He's really come a long way.  Yeah?  Yeah.  His last big thing was October 11, 2011, just recently. 
[00:42:00]  He was a guest on ESPN's Sports Nation, where he sang a special rendition of St. Elmo's Fire.  Oh.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  What other hits did he have?  That's got to be it.  Was it Naughty Naughty?  And then St. Elmo's Fire?  Yeah.  He had a song called Magical, which peaked at 73.  Well, Magical, can we hear Magical for a second?  The only reason is because it's one of our bits, where the one-hit wonders, even though 
[00:42:30]  St. Elmo's Fire gives him those two hits, where Magical's going to be a lot like Naughty  Naughty.  It's going to be like a, what do we say?  A sideways version.  A sideways version of Naughty Naughty.  I wanted to see if this is true here.  Magical!  Dan-an-an.  Yeah.  Dan-an-an-an.  I used to be Naughty Naughty. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  This thing.  It doesn't have that magic that Naughty Naughty had.  Neither did Naughty Naughty.  Just got to get to the house.  Don't worry.  he won't play the cars this guy's great that was mullet more chicks and cars and oh the 80s

[00:51:30]  yeah nirvana going into the rock and roll hall of fame  seems like just yesterday  we were here doing the show love bus came out in 1988  88 1988 i remember listening to a lot of nirvana when um i was working for a living yeah  on job sites and whatnot a lot of nirvana and a lot of guns and roses 
[00:52:00]  that was always blasting out the old radio  everyone remembers when nirvana hit it just yeah  fucking changed the game holy  fuck  right yep certainly did whether you liked them or not you couldn't deny that they were changing the  fucking game for a lot of bands yeah  who's going in uh you got the nirvana  we got uh kiss finally after 15 years of eligibility 
[00:52:30]  they've been denied for 15 straight years they're finally going in but are they going in i'm hoping  that they go in gene ace peter and paul i want all four of the original members  we'll see going in together  gene will have something to say about that  something tells me they're going to i have a feeling  something tells me gene's going to be a complete  dick about it it doesn't matter because the core of the band was me  and uh i i should dictate who goes in right stop typing but they now they know what the fans  want and to be more money in the greatest hits record you think like yeah if the four of them 
[00:53:00]  go in i think to be more of an interest in it from the fans i hope you're right but he might be  holding a grudge because of some of the things peter chris said in his book maybe yeah sure  you know gene's an asshole right it was pretty much pepper throughout the entire book  a little pepper here a little pepper there then you got peter gabriel going in as a solo artist he  went into the rock and roll hall of fame with genesis back in 2010 ah but as a solo artist 
[00:53:30]  you like the peter gabriel not really what songs did he have solo besides sledgehammer oh my god a  million shock the monkey salisbury hill there you go a little salisbury hill oh yeah i know this okay  shock the monkey in your eyes in your eyes thank you all right yeah this is the movie trailer song  always red rain yeah this is that shining remix yeah how much did he make on this song wow yeah  he's he's had a lot of okay yeah yeah and then for the for the for the ones that like to go a little 
[00:54:00]  deeper a song called biko biko biko want to hear biko not really that means we got to hear biko yeah  this is a great fucking song you're all right with this one sam you're all right with this this  song i'm okay with all right okay thank god okay i feel a little hipper today because you like this  song no i didn't say i like it thank god i was okay it's a good song sam you don't have to try so hard 
[00:54:30]  to be so and in the now and in the now look out sam roberts doesn't like it look out i'm not trying  i was born in 83 i don't know wish you died in 84 i love those little oh that little tombstone  how sad it is consecutive dates on it let's hear the beat go a little deep uh track what the hell 
[00:55:00]  was that whose phone was that not mine not high mine's a queef when i get a text oh what's this  song about i feel like there's some african shit going on here is there i don't know what is this  about oh oh a man who preached non-violence melston mandela steve biko oh oh anthony cummia yes thank 
[00:55:30]  you was imprisoned tortured and killed in a jail in south africa this is for steven biko  oh he was in jail not as uh popular as mandela i guess steven biko no  you guys survived that jail stuff was there a movie i guess biko there was a movie yeah this 
[00:56:00]  is looks like a clips from a movie this was a big deal about a movie  september 77 this stinks  it's a story song is that denzel what's that denzel biko i don't know  oh the evil white people are in his face  because you don't like this ant no of course not 
[00:56:30]  yeah there's a black story here  fuck them  yeah peter gabriel has a great voice though man i thought it was a song about a bird face  you know it's an italian bird hey my biko 
[00:57:00]  let's say hi to john in virginia john  yeah  hey guys uh  hold on i can't hear you start over peter gabriel but i can't remember if it was 92 or 93 did a  performance in the grammys with the circus l8 and he did a song called steam and for a lot of people  it was considered to be the best uh grammy performance ever it's kind of hard to find on  the internet but if you can find it i guess it's worth looking up if it was the best performance 
[00:57:30]  you'd be able to find it on youtube i'm thinking steve was another good song by peter gabriel  by the way i'm sorry i'm done oh jesus we heard you yeah i'm so sick of the cirque du soleil like  they're great athletes but enough already with the fucking cirque du soleil oh she's hanging from those  claws spinning by her ankle yeah amazing oh her arms are out i'm blown away by those shows still  i'm just tired of it they're amazing athletes but i'm just sick of it and the humor in cirque du soleil  was terrible it was dripping and the dumb clowns running around with their umbrellas 
[00:58:00]  fucking boo and those clowns my extra girlfriend made me go because i'd fucked up badly so i was  trying to make up with her so i took her to vegas and i mean i went to two cirque shows  i know i really oh that's why yeah really fucked up and it didn't work it did a little i mean she  was cool in vegas we almost had one gigantic fight but we just didn't uh because i got food  poisoning we actually get along really well that week anyway peter gabriel makes it into the rock 
[00:58:30]  and roll hall of fame and then who else you got uh the hall and oats oh there you go that's a fun  little combo right little hall and oaks i suck they had some great hits  sarah smile sarah smile oh wow travis had it queued up you're wrong sam the hall notes was pretty  good they suck they had a shitload of hits apparently someone's never heard of make my dreams come true 
[00:59:00]  oh boy or kiss on my list all right who else uh i wouldn't say this is the best song no it's a  little you can we have a little up tempo maybe something for you a little something for the  guys how about a little private eyes there you go how about a little private eyes trav they're watching  you i know the hand clap there you go now we're rocking no on the big 69 how do you not like with  the hall of oats when louie when louie walked by i think i wouldn't even make eye contact with 
[00:59:30]  him that's one of my favorite moments in the fucking radio i wish i was filming the whole  fucking thing what the fuck man yeah what's wrong you crank it up would you  fucking leave your ears at the door kid let's turn this shit up and rip off the dial  it's just we're falling off yeah 
[01:00:00]  oh it's one first yeah one first then two don't feel bad for not knowing that  this sucks why you can play along it's a blackboard song it's rick allen's least favorite song  you can't you can't walk around and look all cool if you listen to this all of a sudden you're not  the cool guy fonzie roberts oh yeah there's a huge gap between being overly cool huh really it's 
[01:00:30]  like i don't know 35 years old oh why the beginning didn't stop and come in uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh  yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right private eyes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah watching you watching you  take a drink take a drink you're missing your parts where you get to clap  uh-huh you're right you're missing your parts where you get to clap  oh shit oh exactly if that was a rap song those would be gunshots yeah let's get back on track 
[01:01:00]  white people clapping let's get back on track with the clapping oh well we got  a guitar listen to this fucking rocking guitar solo oh it gets to shine yeah  so we get the solo light out oh yeah making that guitar talk sam right oh here we go back to  clapping this is lame the bridge  you don't think his voice is like soothing yeah no it sucks no it's like a little hands massaging your 
[01:01:30]  ears oh here we go  clapping come on clap you could be pulling clap no i can't  they're clapping oh yeah no i would describe this as the drizzling shits yeah yeah the drizzling  shits yeah yeah great name right yeah that is a good one oh man you're just you're just waiting 
[01:02:00]  for some rap artist to fucking steal a little hall and then all you'll be all about it yeah yeah i'm  sure yeah yeah i probably would enjoy it more yeah yeah your kiss is on my list your kiss is on my  list your lips or list lips it's list i think your kiss is on my list no it's not it's what is it  fucking i'm not sure that schindler your kiss is on my lips i thought it was lips who makes a list of  kisses it might be lit wait uh look it up play it let's just figure it out our songs i could easily 
[01:02:30]  look up the lyrics i think it's like the shitty song i'm pretty sure it's list  well maybe it's a list it is shimler's list the kiss is on my list of what things the best things  in life other things to do it says it it says bucket list it says it's on the best things in  life what a pussy ass song what can i see come on it's lips let's find out i don't feel the need to  give some secrets away i thought it was funny because i would say you're pissing on my lips 
[01:03:00]  that's what i would say it's list yeah but i think you're right it's a crime that beyonce sold  828 well let's make it 829 000 copies in three days why is it a crime yesterday you thought the  album was catchy because fucking hall and oates should be selling that many records today yeah my bliss  yeah i tell them this know what the reason is okay i kind of like that a little bit 
[01:03:30]  he said list list either way he's singing about john list yeah he's gonna kiss from john list  and then a gunshot sound  yeah we got two more paul and oates is one of those bands from the 80s that does not translate  you know they are lame now apparently you've never been to a wedding they always play this 
[01:04:00]  stuff these are wedding staples i didn't think the shitty songs played at weddings right and i  didn't play this at my wedding yeah yeah people just sit around waiting for the dj to play private  eyes and then everyone gets up onto the fucking dance yeah yeah private eyes they're watching you  like the security guard in the store see that'd be cool they changed it you don't like make my dreams  come true no come on no you do there was that one hall hall and oates song played at my wedding  not one well no and the dance floor was deprived your guests that's right the end floor was yes 
[01:04:30]  this song sucks too this is great  it's so stupid and it holds a candle these are deep lyrics man listen yeah you might learn something  burn the candle that's right it doesn't it no  what yeah like it i guess it had its time for like a very short time and then  everybody realized it was horrible yeah no apparently they're realizing it was very good 
[01:05:00]  today yeah they shouldn't be that paul and oates should not be in the rock and roll hall of fame  good one don't don't worry you can still be the coolest guy i don't need to be cool oh you but you  are saying you don't need to be or try to be you just you just don't know what this is about guy with  your music i'd like to make a video to this song of me just dumping out his baggy of childhood hair  into a sewer with his scalp attached to it you notice he's the only one still wearing the beats because 
[01:05:30]  he wants to be cool oh yeah yeah we all decide the beats suck for radio show radio but sam can't  can't accept that right because he wants the cool factor that's right yeah it's not about having  the cool they're made for music those beats not for broadcasting many different radio shows  on this platform that use these headphones yeah down the hall well that's wonderful across the street  across the hall that's one of them that's right oh you want to hear man eater oh yes oh she's 
[01:06:00]  thank you peter from massachusetts he goes you have to play man eater they had a lot of hits  here's all i forgot this one it's even a matter of not being exposed like i know all these songs  we're getting requests now from all over the world they all suck all these songs this is a good song  no it's not it's come out at night come on who doesn't want to dance to this me oh  because you are one so who's a man eater who's eating man ass in this song oh really a man eater yeah 
[01:06:30]  why would they think about man you know well she's a man eater she goes to a lot of dudes no  he's talking about his cock it's an anteater he's uncut  and the jokes keep on  and hit it yeah  so he comes out at night she sleeps all day  you want danny to come in because he knows these  no no you're sure no no you're sure no i don't know if we're doing this justice we are 
[01:07:00]  rock and roll hall of fame i think you should come in and give us two cents on this no there should be  something that says even if a band is successful if in hindsight they fucking suck you don't think  that a lot of the uh rap songs of the past in hindsight just stink not in the rock and roll hall of  fame oh please not in the rock and roll hall of these guys were hit makers five freddy is relevant  i'm not saying he's relevant but it doesn't yeah it doesn't suck like this some old really  not the hall of fame stuff talk to me when jay-z talk to me when jay-z has as many hits as 
[01:07:30]  all and that's exactly face no no it doesn't doesn't not yet my brother and i don't say could  we're gonna i mean because she's a fat ass all she wants she'll never be all notes i wonder if  they've outsold paul and i was probably over historically probably not no uh we forgot about  another song thank you steven tamper go ahead yeah rich girl is the best song oh there you go  oh my god another hit that's a terrible song they even say bitch in it oh my god yeah jesus 
[01:08:00]  the soundtrack of my youth of course it's a bitch girl see yeah that was edgy come on come on  you couldn't say bitch no it's crazy but i wish they never had also oh man  yeah damn how are you gonna get your your street cred up after this show today sam i don't have  street cred i'm not worried about street cred oh he has buddy booth cred i bet i bet jay-z has more 
[01:08:30]  singles than hollywoods what i don't think so no they don't i don't think so there's no way  that's the real world kids hold on what it turned down the whole notes that's rachel from the real  world and the guy's racial oh my god thank you for keeping that up thank you no way that's rachel on  the right and the dude was on uh real world as well they dated on real world no way wait they're married 
[01:09:00]  to each other yeah we're all old because i mean the fact that you could have it's not racial  marriage is it yeah it is a real world why are they on tv yeah they're politicians now that one  guy is yeah i already knew i've actually sort of devastated i am not somebody dying of a  i am someone living with face let's go is he still on no it was my favorite real world by far  i was san francisco is the best one hey chubbs everyone sees it parents and parents came to 
[01:09:30]  america chubbs rachel campos right still looks pretty good rachel campos campos it's like rolling  rolling campos right yeah and so rachel campos duffy spokesperson for the  should be rolling it looks like what progressive he was in the same real world yeah he was a lumberjack  that's a great thing you know why the famous saying the generals are always fighting the last 
[01:10:00]  war a lot of famous saying i've never heard that joe yeah they got nothing to talk about  they're just married that's that's the big news here who is married racial and uh what was that  guy's name i thought joe and tweety lumberjack guy lumberjack guy tweety jesus christ i bet if you  put your iced tea by her vagina it cools off sam is obsessing trying to trying to prove us wrong  no not yet brother not yet a few more fucking records 16 top 10 hits yep jay-z i can't find the 
[01:10:30]  list exactly exactly no one cares there's no way jay-z  no one cares 16 in the top 10 there's no way jay-z he's been around for over 10 years i know  that i've proven his fucking career is a busk what are you talking about hauling out 16 hits  been around for longer than 10 years that's right and they had most of their fucking hits in that uh  10-year period oh yeah in the 80s we're very kind to hauling out yeah but everything since the 80s  has been very unkind well you know what what's going to happen in the 2020s with jay-z he's gone through 
[01:11:00]  three decades so far three yes not 96 that's the 90s stop it the 2010s the 20s and then the 2010s  stop it with your jay-z three decades hero worship you got for this fucking prick you have hero worship  for 80s bands not for him yeah what that's right no all right like saga  on the loose who doesn't like on the loose why saga me no now that's a rocking song let me hear it 
[01:11:30]  come on  we're gonna take it to another level with saga i'll tell you right now sound shitty tonight i'm on the  loose right there it is sam now this exactly this is your rock and roll why don't you just relate  to it sing tonight my assholes loose yeah i got it oh yeah i feel like we should watch the video oh

[01:13:30]  word properly look at his big fucking oh they'll show them again they love that big bulge you gotta  see his big bulge jimmy he stuffs i just want to poke it a lot of running a lot of people running in  80s videos and being chased sure well there was turmoil all the time you know what it's a metaphor  for the cold war that's right i have no idea the 80s might be the worst decade in music 
[01:14:00]  oh yeah come on here he goes keyboards dude this is my part from the airman yes  you would do the say this is big for you oh no because we had to find fucking keyboard songs  i'm almost positive we did on the loose that must have sucked  come on this rocks right sam no no i'm feeling it the 80s are probably the worst decade in music  since the 30s that's not true i think the 40s 50s 60s and 70s are all better than the 80s oh my god 
[01:14:30]  you're not your eros movie all over again yeah let's go back in time all right jimmy watch look  about they gotta show his package again this guy has a bowling ball in the front of his pants oh yeah  he's stuffing do you think he's stuff oh he's stuffed right before the video  wow he goes wow yeah he's got a giant they're not showing it again they only showed him that one shot

[01:15:30]  was like the worst wear and tear when you're vomiting in front of a toilet saga had a huge career man  what was after the song why uh let's see it might not have been anything that's that's about it  they might have had one they didn't oh oh they had uh uh oh no uh it wasn't uh on the loose or it might  be fucking up my band sidewinder or uh give me some saga they didn't deserve to have one hit oh my god 
[01:16:00]  that song rocked on the loose that's that's the song you you crank up every time you hear it on the  radio yes give me their song list sam i feel like they had one more that almost made it  wind me oh that's right not sidewinder is wind him up that was before on the loose yeah but then  that hit 24 the flyer hit 19 jesus the flyer i don't think we know that one  i think wind him up was the other one that they try to  oh saga does this wind him up i don't even know i remember this sounds like mega man this band is 
[01:16:30]  garbage but i don't know there i remember this kind of just trash i don't know  you see mtv didn't have a lot of bands to pick from for whatever reason  obviously not so when they had a band they were just hoping they could get another hit from them  a lot of times they just did it you don't appreciate fucking you know cocaine and aids 
[01:17:00]  you probably had to be high on coke and sick with aids to enjoy this  kevin in philly wants to have it out with sam all right oh boy he's taking out with sam the  too cool for the room sam rock i'm not too cool at all sam to say saga sucks is too cool for the  right that's right all beyonce it's brave to say that saga rocks don't you understand how a real  hipster thinks don't listen to your girl music right it is so much braver it's so much braver to

[01:42:00]  rule people you know like the what suits and ties with notebooks oh i think you meant from people in  thailand oh yeah that's what i thought too the ties that have the best pornography i think so they put  people in a box like oh no we mustn't meanwhile people like it in the box no you know put people  like that's why i hated traditional school it sucked it's like they made you want to think  a certain way speaking in metaphors like suits ties yeah the darn suits in the box i don't know what 
[01:42:30]  the traditional school was like traditional school is horrible sucked why it's like when i went to  school was like a plus b had equal c you know what i mean the way it was one plus two equals three  a plus b equals c i'll put them in a special whatever they're variables they could be anything  a plus b equals a and b a plus b equals a b right it was b equals the sum of a and b right right it's  not necessarily c unless c equals the sum of a and b then it could be c but that's not a given but 
[01:43:00]  that's not a given they're they're variables you could never make an individual they wanted to make  sheep i hate sheep why again with the house you're gonna get pussy fucking sheep yeah sheep  fucking what's wrong with sheep no i'd rather be a leader in the file yeah before with everybody  else yeah what if you're playing following exactly what if you hate sheep what do you count when you're  trying to sleep yeah uh usually bread doughnuts yeah beheaded prostitutes relaxing nice relaxing  we gotta go trolling for some hookers one day trolling you bring up you bring up beheaded 
[01:43:30]  prostitutes like oh speaking of that we gotta go trolling for some of those like this hey  she looks mighty fine over there oh yeah check the oh for the adam's apple yeah she doesn't have  one you pass her yeah hopefully she has one oh all the better to crush with your hands  exactly she has nice long hair you can pet like lenny  that's a perfect movie roll from lenny for mice and men that would be good yeah you'd be good at that 
[01:44:00]  i wouldn't have to do too much stuff really just yeah just snap a neck or two why not holy  if i had ketchup i'd give it all to you george oh boy remember he wanted ketchup for his beans  oh did he kill a mouse no it was a woman like  i don't know it's your own dog i'm going yeah  i thought he like broken a mouse yeah this would explain a lot of the uh problems 
[01:44:30]  i think you missed the uh point of the story george wouldn't have killed him if he just  accidentally strangled a mouse why don't we play the dog video  okay it was tweeted yesterday anthony retweeted then  fuck it was all over the place i thought it was a goof at first uh it's a guy a couple of women  and they're uh cooking making meatloaf or something it's a meatloaf or something  they're talking about their um sexual uh exploits and and how they lost their virginity right but it 
[01:45:00]  takes this bizarre turn and it's real it's a documentary it's you know of how they lost their virginity to  dogs right oh well probably a couple girls we fucked oh yeah uh you got that there sam that's  wonderful stop fussing around oh i i did a lot of tweeting last night sam i did a lot of tweeting  last night of the big hairy dogs oh yeah why like being nailed by a sheepdog or something yeah well one  of the women do she does talk about the fact that she likes uh fur so there they go they're just 
[01:45:30]  cooking some meatloaf and they're just pigs oh they are pigs they're not even for the dog to eat  yeah feed that dog you know feed the dog while he's fucking you might shove that up your vagina  yeah all right you know everybody everybody else asks watch the chuck wagon come around the corner  and go up your cunt um wait go back well she looked oh god they're hot right mike let me try this  way i want to see it uh uh the treat with the plaid looks like you oh my god mike and the bachettiets 
[01:46:00]  yeah this video it almost looks like it's an snl skit yeah it looks like a skit it's very well  it's filmed very well you sure it's not a skit no no it's it's the real deal it's so weird it's the  real deal oh look at those hands and fingers that filthy pig has it's looking yeah it's  cooking cooking meat after she's probably jerked off a dog what do you think that white is in the 
[01:46:30]  meatloaf uh doggy come i know oh damn it it's like his anal drippings from that dog oh my god  mike mike oh come on i always take it too far how am i supposed to work on the heart on now  i got excited when i seen you're making the meat  all right here we go so you know everybody everybody else asks i haven't heard uh what was 
[01:47:00]  your first experience um well actually it was kind of interesting i was house sitting for somebody  watching their dog and their birds and their fish and stuff um i was maybe 10 11 years old i don't  quite remember so i went skinny dipping and one day i bent over to test the water you know how you do  just bend over yeah nice to know how cold it is yes and um well their dog kind of snuck up behind me  and stuck his nose between my legs needless to say i was a little bit surprised but i was like hmm that 
[01:47:30]  feels good uh but then he decided he wanted a little more so he jumped on and at that point  i learned what it was to lose your virginity it scared me half to death but then pause i don't  believe it whoa no no why absolutely not why because it's because they're making meatloaf as they talk  about this conversation for her to be talking about being fucked by a dog well the nose thing i would 
[01:48:00]  have believed if she left it that i just don't buy it no i at first see that's why i said at first i  didn't buy this i thought it was like they set up this video to talk about it but as you watch you  realize no they're not acting this isn't they're they're telling the truth here and and yeah this was  set up to talk about they could talk about this it wasn't just all of a sudden it's a cooking show  that turns into right right right right yeah yeah but the best part attention like that dog  fucked me around the block and you know things like that what was that i guess you're more intense 
[01:48:30]  like i i i fucking teabagged that fucking mutt for a while oh jesus it must sound perfect in his head  though it has to go through grinders hey didn't that kid that guy and fucking uh run into a movie  theater and step on a bunch of gnats no those were people he shot what's so weird about this video is  she's telling this story about being you know fucked by a dog the other lady's putting the  meatloaf in the oven oh yeah she decides she has to make meatballs or something yeah she's cooking 
[01:49:00]  they gotta eat go back balls slightly even dog fuckers have to eat right you know they're very  hungry why was this video made that's uh it's like a documentary on on on uh people that like having  sex with animals oh okay yeah yeah that meat might be dog he could have ticked her off wow  i didn't think of that how did he make her come she broke his heart made into a  fucking bologna sandwich you never know ground up dog and could be who the fuck knows 
[01:49:30]  fucking home run lover's quarrel right oh yeah she got ticked off at him and just  grabbed the fucking dog off too more dog lingo oh ticks yeah yeah he didn't have time to flee  she looks like a dog oh yes he should have she looks like a dog but look at that she look oh god  oh boy that hurt exactly all right let's play it some more yeah it scared me half to death but then 
[01:50:00]  it kind of started feeling good and i'm like hmm yeah but then again the other scare that i had was  oh my god i'm gonna have puppies i think i was like 22 the first time that i had you know allowed  a dog to have sexual intercourse so um it kind of just grew from there oh yeah but i mean i had dog  companions in between i've always loved the feel of fur my whole life and my dog was always there as a 
[01:50:30]  good friend soaking up tears whatever i was going through and i don't know i guess it was just one  night we were snuggling in bed and i was petting him and he just got very curious and you know i mean  it was more of an oral thing and i mean i became kind of curious about him so i mean to begin with it  was more of just curiosity how horny does she have to be so you lost virginity to a human first i was  like 15 or 16. i was 21 when i lost my virginity to a human before i was 16 because you know i guess 
[01:51:00]  i was more curious sexually and and more interested butter there's the butter problem was most of my  boyfriends weren't interested in it and i never could figure out why ellie did eventually meet ken  oh my god oh my god oh my god what's this about now what is this it's about uh people that like  having sex with animals but how'd they get these two to admit this it's i guess it's a documentary 
[01:51:30]  okay they must have solicited people or um this is new it doesn't look old no no this this is  definitely new and then she meets this guy kin uh who apparently likes uh having sex with uh animals  too oh sam hit play please yeah who shares her sexual preference  oh grab a couple handfuls of that smaller okay look at her fat ass ugh that disgusting i was 
[01:52:00]  technically a virgin until i was 29 years old i was a zoophile up until then and i just basically  didn't have much interest in uh other members of my own species as far as a life bond or anything  but when i met ellie here i just we clicked it it was the one person that uh that i felt within a  week probably after i met her we're meant to be together there you go come sit over here ken and  ellie met through a zoo friend on the internet right over and after a few weeks they arranged their

[02:05:30]  just just the tip mike if you had to what animal would you let fuck you in the ass oh  okay that's a good valid question that's a fair question we'll all go around the room with this  one you first because they got some hot yeah okay you want a kangaroo to fuck you  you know like anybody breaks your balls afterwards it's cool  i would take a a worm or a fly it wouldn't hurt you actually want a marsupial 
[02:06:00]  big kangaroo maybe a blue whale  the size of a fucking chevy the strangest kangaroo  in no time he did it five seconds after you had to think about kangaroo  he's definitely thought about this  all right let's go back to oh yeah here he goes  good fun  whickers and blows in my ear etc and that is very erotic to me more so than the physical sex 
[02:06:30]  of course when he's courting me as it were courting trying to entice me to uh to bend down or kneel down  um he he does a lot of uh um  i call it a hubba hubba he just kind of goes her and makes this little hubba hubba noise to me  um and then a little talking to the horse you know what it is he's talking to his other friends  he's he's talking to the other horses he's going turn around boys i'm going big  oh god 
[02:07:00]  she slapped the horse on the ass you go let's go buddy and you know get them all worked up  like come on buddy let's get this party started  did you back that up because it's getting really hot yeah please  slightly hot to be soft in this room

[02:08:00]  grunting noise and then when he orgasms he makes an even bigger grunting noise  he tends to like to hold on with his teeth and i actually have some scars on my back from where  he's bitten onto me just hanging on jesus uh they do the same thing with mares when they have sex  and only his mares have fur to hang on to he tends to get a big chunk of skin with me  and that can be quite painful but usually i don't even notice until after the fact because i'm so

For completing the survey, you are receiving two free boarding passes.  Yeah!  The officer's going on a cruise.  That means you're allowed to get on the boat.  Meanwhile, you know, you need a room.  You need airfare to get there.  Well, that's the beauty.  You should see how much they're going to fuck you for.  How much would that save you, though, the boarding pass?  I have no idea.  I would assume they're going to call me right back. 
[02:21:30]  And what's great is, since you've taken that survey and agreed to let them have...  I don't think that any talent marketers would use your number for anything else.  You're never going to get any calls because you just did that.  No, I don't know about that, guys.  No, I think they're legit.  You just clicked on every spam ad on a computer.

It sounds like...  It's just like, bring as many people as you like.  We have any...  You can have some more boarding passes.  We have any cruise songs to celebrate?  Oh, man.  Something like feeling hot, hot, hot?  Oh, oh, Mike?  The electric slide.  Oh.  How does that song go?  It don't move.  It's electric.  It's electric.  I wish it was the chair you were sitting in.

[02:23:00]  I think everybody should.  It's an easy survey.  I'll give the number out so everyone else can fucking...  Yeah.  Wow.  Nice.  I'll give the number out.  That's great.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  That's awesome, Anthony.  Who are you taking?  Congratulations, because you're a lot.  I used to fill out surveys at, like, Boston Market.  Oh, yeah?  For a cruise?  Free master.  Free master.  What'd you get?  Yeah.  What'd you get?  No, I never won.  I'm so pissed off.  What were you trying to win?  You don't win from a survey.  You get something for doing it, don't you? 
[02:23:30]  It's probably not like a prize.  It's like one of those things where you sit in on the timeshare meeting and you get,  like, free tickets to something.  Maybe it's like Best Buy.  They give you the receipt and say, if you fill out the survey, you get in the drawing for $10,000.  And then you get...  Oh, okay.  You're on the drawing.  Yeah, yeah.  But, by the way, that's Opie, who got the phone call.  Yeah, that was their thing.  I love what...  I never really won that much stuff.  I have, like, a third-place bowling trophy.  That's the biggest thing I've ever won in my life. 
[02:24:00]  A third-place bowling trophy?  Oh, my God.  I thought he said bowling trophy.  Yeah.  A third-place bowling trophy?  Who came in first?  Anita Bryant?  Oh, no.  I fucked up.  Oh, no.  God damn it.  I was trying to come up with the fucking one to an MS.  Yeah, fucking...  I bought, like, a 66, I think.  Why are you...  Oh, and that's for the cello.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's for the cello.  But why is he proud of a third-place bowling trophy?  That's the only thing I really won, really.  All right.  That's right.  I don't know if lottery tickets are cool, but I mean, I won't...  I hope a surgeon has to remove it from your ass at some point. 
[02:24:30]  Blanket party.  I hope you win one of those.  What was your score?  Like a 66, I think.  But I was, like, 10.  That's terrible.  Third-place 60.  A 66?  Yeah, I'm going to be bowling against.  All, like, Boy Scouts.  It was, like, a Boy Scout, Cub Scout.  A 66.  Yeah, I said he was helping, you know, three people playing.  Holy fuck.  A 66.  This is a run-down Bowman Alley in Bayonne.  It was horrible.  Yeah.  What's the most money you ever won on a scratch-off?  I won 100.  Holy shit.  One day.  I love to play them, Rob. 
[02:25:00]  I mean, sure.  How much money have you spent on them?  Oh, God.  Countless.  I don't know what kind of money I spent on them.  I'll go to, like, the diner where I live and just, like, put money in the machine.  I went for a couple of $20 ones.  I'm thinking, yeah, but...  Yeah.  They didn't pan out, though, huh?  No.  Son of a bitches.  I hope OP Radio's two free cruise boarding passes are donated to Mike Buschetti,  and the ship gets hijacked by Somali pirates.  Somalis might be cool to hang out with, you know?  That would be good. 
[02:25:30]  We like a boat movie.  You want to take that chance, are you?  Yeah.  They wouldn't even know what to make of you.  Yeah, they would.  Idiot soup.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Are they headhunting?  Dinner for the whole town?  Should we continue?  Holy fuck.  Yeah, but are they headhunting the Somalis?  Huh?  Are they, like, headhunting tribes, like, in the Amazon? 
[02:26:00]  No.  What gear is this?  I don't think so.  Exactly.  I think they're just, like...  It's Gilligan's Island you're thinking of.  Yeah.  No, they just hijack ships.  For money.  Yes, they say, I'm the captain now.  For cash.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's right.  They're, like, modern pirates.  Irish.  Bundabuses, swords, swashbuckling, all that shit.  Swashbuckling.  Oh, my goodness.  Who's swatches, Luke?  Those are pirates I love, like, you know, Errol Flynn.  Wait, do you like... 
[02:26:30]  What kind of pirates?  Like, Errol Flynn, like, those guys with swords and movies from the 30s.  Ah, right, yes.  Sword fights.  Sure.  That's old flesh sword fights.  Name your top five pirates, Mike Brissetti.  Oh, Johnny Depp's pirate.  Yes.  What do you call him?  Yeah, Willie Stargel.  All right.  He needed the money.  Johnny Depp.  Captain Hook.  Captain Hook.  There was another one.  He was English William...  Oh, fuck.  I can't remember his last name now. 
[02:27:00]  No, it was William Fuchs.  You mispronouncing it.  Oh, the pirates in Swiss Family Robertson.  They were awesome.  They were brutal-looking cocks on themselves.  What about the pirates of Penzance, your fruit?  Oh, I didn't know.  I never went to a play in my life.  My mom loves to go.  Family goes all the time.  Oh, yeah?  I'll see what...  West Side Story's my favorite, but I don't like it.  She just told you she was going to a play.  She was looking for retroactive morning after business.  I can't just watch a guy do a plane and sing. 
[02:27:30]  She'd go see Beauty and Her Son.  Oh, Mike.  Oh, Mike.  We love you.  Mike Gee.  There you go.  That's terrible.  I think there's a good role for Nathan Lane in the movie.  Oh, yeah?  He took the plane as a superhero.  Play him as the flame in the Fantastic Four.  Who's the Fantastic Four?  Oh, the guy with the Fatest.  Yeah, Ben, the flame, the chick.  I thought it was the human door. 
[02:28:00]  Are you just blurting words out now?  Exactly.  I think it's just words.  I feel like you're one contestant on $100,000 Pyramid.  I don't know what you're talking about.  He's throwing words out and hoping it informs a sentence.  Something comes out.  Oh, the Fantastic Four, right?  Yeah.  What's your five favorite words, Mike Bacchetti?  Oh.  That's a good one.  From St. I don't curse words, or just...  Just words.  Five words.  Jerk off.  That's a word slash activity. 
[02:28:30]  Jerk off.  What do you call it?  Dick weed.  We're calling people right.  Dick weed.  Ass wipe.  And one more.  One more.  Cock head.  Cock head.  You know what I like about Mike?  All except one of his top five favorite words are compound words.  Are more than just one word.  We're going to let him slide.  Dick weed.  We're going to let him slide.  I like that.  Hyphenated.  That's right, Sam.  I wish I would have did better in school.  I was just like...  Is that right?  Sam, my desk looked like Oscar Madison's, and teachers would pull me apart, pull me by  the ear.  My teacher, like, grabbed me 100 feet by my ear. 
[02:29:00]  That's fucking twat.  Wow.  Why'd she do that?  She was like, look at that desk.  It's a mess.  It's all, like, no containers.  Like, there's six months old in there.  Why are you so messy?  Why don't you throw out the note?  I don't know.  Wait, you had a desk?  You don't have a desk like for the whole time.  You sure this wasn't your job?  Yeah.  I thought it was in school.  My secretary teacher would yell at me.  Yeah, she was screaming.  But every period you had a different desk.  A different desk.  Uh-oh, what school did you go to?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Okay.  Oh, my God, gosh.  Nobody's eating crayons and cool.  Oh, my God.  Mike, how long was the bus you rode?  I was going to school.  Right.  The old one desk the whole day school.  Oh, no.  You were on the other side of the school.  Some of that messy papers.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, she was a full-sized bus and a bra machine.  Automatic stairs come down from the bus.  A lot of construction paper and paste classes.  No, no.  Nobody's eating crayons or anything like that.  Is it weird to leave the house without a hockey helmet? 
[02:30:00]  Oh, no.  No, no.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, something like that.  No, no.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  Nobody's sticking their heads in toilets all day.  No, no.  I promise you.  So wait, so you had the same desk all day?  Yeah.  All throughout high school or just?  All throughout grammar school.  Okay, so like maybe elementary school.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember elementary school we did sit in one classroom with one teacher.  Yes.  Up until probably sixth grade or fifth grade, somewhere around there.  Seventh grade for me.  Seventh?  I think it was sixth. 
[02:30:30]  Junior high started with me.  Junior high was seventh for us.  Yeah.  No, sixth grade I was changing classes.  By sixth grade, yeah.  Really?  Yeah, but not a lot.  There were like, I think, four.  Yeah, yeah.  Like four classes.  She did.  But before that.  Oh, no, no.  I was in a regular class.  But before that, it was the desk.  You kept all milks in your desk?  Yeah.  I was like, I don't want to.  I left all stuff in there.  Did it stink?  Yeah, she was complaining.  And she goes, somebody that smells like something really bad.  Oh, God.  You had a stinky desk?  No, but she humiliated me from the class.  She's like, let's look at his desk. 
[02:31:00]  She's pulling out like.  That makes for a healthy adulthood.  Yeah, there's milk allowed on the desk.  What is she supposed to do?  He's got fucking rotten milks in her head.  Well, let's see if anything's missing.  I know.  You know, she used to like, she just grabbed me by the ear.  She goes, this is going to teach you a good lesson.  She just grabbed me.  Grabbed your ear?  Yeah.  Just ripped my ear.  Grabbed your ear?  Yeah.  You shot milk.  Wait a minute.  Did she grab both your ears and wash your face with a stinky sponge?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, wait.  No, no.  I think so. 
[02:31:30]  Wait.  Yes, you did.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  You are a naughty, naughty boy.  Naughty, naughty.  Naughty, naughty.  Naughty, na, na, na, na.  My Catholic school is brutal.  I went there for a while.  You went to Catholic school?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to first grade and then high school.  The nuns?  The nuns?  The nuns?  The nuns?  The nuns?  The nuns?  The nuns?  No, my handwriting was horrible.  To this day, it still itch.  Yeah.  So the nuns in those days just took the rule and just smashed my knuckles.  Did they really do that?  Yeah.  Well, let's see your handwriting.  There you go.  What can he write?  Yeah.  Okay.  What do you want to write?  Write something if you want to see your child again. 
[02:32:00]  Yes.  Right.  All right.  Hold on.  I got it.  I got it.  Hopefully it's a suicide note.  Write the Opie and Anthony show.  Make it easy.  All right.  I hope.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  See how horrible this is.  Wow.  It's taken up almost the whole page.  That should be hung up on a refrigerator.  It looks like Charles Manson wrote it.  Oh, my God.  No, it looks like.  We just found our new T-shirt design.  Yeah, that is.  That would rule on a T-shirt.  It's very childlike, I must say. 
[02:32:30]  No, it is, but you want to see my script?  And the round little circle to dots the I instead of a dot?  I wrote script in a long time, guys.  You should write Sirius XM in cursive.  Ew, you make a circle dot the I?  Wow.  Cursive is code, so certain people can't read it.  Did you live in Colorado in 1996?  They can't read script.  Oh.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, what are you scribbling?  What is that?  What is that?  What's that?  No, I just thought.  Mike, that's a doodle.  No, guys, she was like, I wasn't writing properly.  She goes, come here.  I want to teach her to write. 
[02:33:00]  I didn't see.  Marsh.  I was just commenting.  What?  I had some broad outside.  Oh.  I was trying to look at her ass.  You know.  You like that, Mike?  I love every one.  There's a lot of hot women out there, guys.  I've got to get one myself.  Yeah.  Mike, top five things you would shove in a girl's ass.  Oh.  I'd stick my meat in and grab those tits and then fuck that skank from the back for a  while.  Oh, let's see.  Oh, let's see.  All right.  That's great.  You stole that from a Hallmark cart, didn't you? 
[02:33:30]  We're trying to keep a rice pudding slapping her in the ass and push it up.  You know what I mean?  Nice.  We're trying to keep it a little family friendly, so be careful.  All right.  Okay.  Let me see.  Top five things.  Holidays, how about a couple of, you know, take her outside, shove a snowball up her butt,  make a good one.  Oh, all right.  That's good.  All right.  That's three.  How about some macadamia nuts?  She was eating nuts over here.  You know.  What?  We've got to ask macadamia first.  It's kind of expensive for that order.  You know, it's like probably 10 bucks a thing.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Two more.  What else?  Let me.  Oh.  How about some Italian pepperoni?  It's always fooled with you.  Like that Italian pepperoni in your pants?  Oh, no, no.  Yeah.  Come on.  Hey.  Hey.  It's like a brajol with a sore on it.  And a pomegranate.  A pomegranate.  How much do you shit those things out of a restaurant?  They used to call them a Chinese apple.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And an avocado.  Only superfoods. 
[02:34:30]  Some blueberries.  Only things with cancer fighting.  A colesia.  That's flying out of that horse ass.  A salmon.  You want that?  A girl's ass.  Look at this.  A pomegranate.  Oh, that's disgusting.  We call them Chinese apples.  It's right.  Today they call them pomegranate.  That's terrible.  They are.  They're superfood.  Yeah.  They're like, they make juice out of them.  Hey.  Aw.  I like the top five game with Mike Pichetti.  Yeah.  I think it's pretty good.  It's kind of fun.  Wow, Mike.  Mike, what's your top five seasons? 
[02:35:00]  Out of four seasons.  Oh, come on.  You got it.  You told us.  You told us.  You got it.  You got it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are the top five excuses you've given when bloody underpants have been found in your  pocket?  Oh, no.  Well, I don't know where these came from.  That's a good one.  That's one.  They'll buy that.  They'll let you go home.  Yes.  I don't know where these came from.  What do you call it?  I start in the start chamber.  Oh, that's two.  Call my lawyer.  Okay.  That's two.  Cover your own ass here.  All right.  Let's see. 
[02:35:30]  I was just kidding.  Don't worry about it.  Okay.  What do you call it?  You really don't have to.  I don't know what to say.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  You don't have to.  I think.  You don't have to.  Are your headphones fixed?  No.  No.  They're still kind of mangled like me.  Wow.  You're exhausting.  Now, what else?  I don't know.  Were you troublesome as a child?  No.  I was always a kid that got picked on, but I'll tell you one good thing, though.  When I went to school, all the tough guys, the real tough guys, always put idiots in 
[02:36:00]  their place for me.  What?  No, no.  If I got picked on by...  They looked after you.  Yeah, yeah.  You were so pathetic.  They looked after you.  No, I'm serious.  They had to bully someone, but they didn't bully him.  Yeah, but when I got picked on, right, one time this guy that I went to school with actually  became, you know, he was a mob guy years later.  Oh, shit.  You know, I mean, he said, shut the fuck up, otherwise you're going to have a problem  with me.  Because this guy was picking on me.  I'm like, wow.  I always got protected by the big guys, the football guys. 
[02:36:30]  It was all the other guys that broke my balls, you know?  Were you funny?  It's like radio.  No, I was very quiet and shy, actually.  I said, like, if they called me for a book report, I'd be hiding in the back, hoping  to go and didn't call me up in front of people.  And then when you did get called up, did you ever have to do an oral report?  Oh, I hated those damn things.  Yeah.  I'm like, I was never good at them.  I was like, fuck, this whore's going to call me up.  No, I don't want to do this.  Yeah, right.  Becoming a comic and an act that brought me out of my shell.  I love it.  Why is everyone a whore in a skank with you?  I know, right?  I got a lot of in-hush. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Somebody has an Edmund Kemper-like relationship with mother, don't they?  No, no, but I mean, yeah, it was kind of embarrassing.  I was always shy like that.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  He's too shy, shy.  Sometimes I still have a show.  No, it sucks.  Okay.  Yeah.  I thought it was hip.  Mm-mm, sucks.  How are you guys in school?  Oh, thanks for asking.  Hey.  I didn't graduate.  What?  I dropped out in the 11th grade, and I went to work. 
[02:37:30]  And then I came back the next year to start anew, all fresh.  And I think I fucked that up in maybe a month or two, and left permanently.  Yeah, but you're successful now.  All those people probably broke your balls.  Oh, I could just tell them to go fuck themselves at this point.  No, it's true.  I love that, because you know what I mean, guys?  You do that shit?  Yeah, we could just stand up here and spit on people.  Ha!  They suck. 
[02:38:00]  Better luck next time.  No, but you guys are cool, though, because you wouldn't.  Some people, bullies would do that.  You know what I mean?  It's none of your hurt, really.  You were bullied.  Yeah, but you know what?  Those days are done.  Are they?  Are they?  What's happening today?  I don't know.  What do you think is happening today?  Listen to the replay.  All right, we're going to take a break.  And when we get back, Mike Bechet is going to close out the show by hula hooping.  Yes.  Oh, that's fun.  We've got to get that on video, of course.  Yes.  Can I just do the head part of it?  I can't do the waist.  What? 
[02:38:30]  My neck is like...  The neck goes good with it.  Whatever you want to do with it.  I'm like that chick from the exorcist.  What the hell?  All right, we're going to figure this out next.  Oh, yeah.  Mike Bechet, hula hoops, just using his neck, I guess.  He doesn't want to use his body.  I like that.  I like that.  Sam, his neck has to come in handy for something.  Right.  It's probably good for going down on chicks, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking tell him, Mike.  I'll kind of practice.  You know how to fucking make a woman happy.  Eat that box?  Eat that snatch and suck those tits.  Well, the other way around, actually. 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Not the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, everyone.  You know what?  A winter dilemma for the gentleman.  She wants to bundle up because it's cold out.  And you want to see some skin.  Oh, boy.  There's a conundrum.  How do you have a hot holiday when she's always cold?  Pajama Graham.  If you want to see some skin, she might be fucking a fucked heart.  Oh, boy.  I don't think P.J. Graham is good for that.  I think he can join in on the Steven Singer reads. 
[02:39:30]  But the pajama Graham ones, I don't think they enjoy the team effort.  Sorry.  I'm so sorry.  That you put forth so well in the Steven Singer.  You might want to apologize immediately.  I'm so sorry.  But, I mean, everybody looks the same when they're naked almost, you know, I think.  Well, I don't think they do at all.  I had to compliment myself.  I'm sorry.  I backpedaled a little bit.  I'm sorry.  Well, you should pedal something.  You know.  All right. 
[02:40:00]  Well, Pajama Graham.  They'll help you out with the hoodie footy.  Hoodie footy from Pajama Graham.  Oh, you didn't look a jackass with that fucking hoodie on.  He's like, look at the feet on that asshole.  No, no.  See.  Look like Ralphie from Christmas Store.  Oh, boy.  They'll show you the fucking wolves.  They don't give a shit how you fucking wolves.  No, no, no.  Once you check for the cats, the money's in the bank, buddy.  See.  See.  Let me explain something.  Steven Singer's been in here, and he has said.  He wants to kick my ass until the end of the doomsday.  No, no. 
[02:40:30]  He loves when we elaborate.  And go off script.  And go off script.  Right.  Exactly, Opie.  He loves when we go off script and just wing it with his reads.  He says as long as you get the website out there, he doesn't care.  But these clients are different.  Yes.  The Pajama Graham people might be a little different.  The Pajama Graham people love the verbatim read.  Right.  They don't want any shenanigans or hijinks being pulled with the copy.  So, with that being said, the Hoodie Footie from Pajama Graham combines the warmth of a hoodie and the coziness of footie pajamas. 
[02:41:00]  That's full of crap.  You're freezing your ass up in the middle of the fucking night over the head.  What kind of shit are they peddling these assholes?  They're fucking selling dick to the devil for fucking money.  You've got to be kidding me.  No, Jesus Christ.  They'll show their fucking ass to their mother for the right amount of money.  No.  Weren't you listening when we explained all this?  They're wonderful gifts for the holidays.  What the fuck is pajamas for gifts?  Some fucking cheap ass fucking thing.  No, you want to see. 
[02:41:30]  Some of you bringing that shit home.  Why don't you get a fucking yo-yo over here with the pajamas?  No, they love it.  They love it.  Girls love the head to toe warmth.  They're full of shit.  They don't want the do-ray meat.  They don't care about pajamas.  Oh, it's made of soft microfleece.  It's got the zip-off feet and a drawstring hood.  Oh, please drawstring.  You're drawstring my ass.  Go to pajamacrim.com.  It's got a long zipper in the front, so imagine unzipping that thing.  Who cares about the zipper to just shut my dick out of the thing and get in?  Who cares about fucking some zipper? 
[02:42:00]  Put it on your fucking head and zip it.  Who cares?  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  There goes that 10-year relationship.  Oh, God.  They got the sweet and sexy set, too.  It has the hoodie-footy.  Sweet and sexy?  You've got to be fucking kidding me with this.  And the sexy Midnight Fantasy short set.  Just gag that whore and shut her up.

[02:43:00]  We've got a little studio meeting we've got to get done before Jimmy's advice show.  That's going to start exactly at 10 a.m.  Today, the advice show, yes.  I want to hear that on the way home.  Oh, it's going to be a home run, and it's going to be a hoax.  I love Jimmy's show.  Mike Pichetta, you've been terrific today.  Thank you, guys.  There's only one thing to do.  Thank you for always having me.  It's so much fun.  You really could hula hoop, huh?  Should we turn the TVs off for this?  What?  Oh, God, guys.  You're going to...  Oh, yeah.  Get up.  Hold on.  Sit down.  Relax for a second, Mike.  Jesus.  Mike, what's the big plug for you? 
[02:43:30]  Oh, actually, today, the movie The Family I was in with De Niro had a small role in it.  It drops today on DVD.  Oh, yeah.  What movie?  The Family.  You were in that?  Yeah, I played a Hasidic guy being held at gunpoint by him.  Oh, very cool, man.  Oh.  You met De Niro?  Was he cool?  He was mind-blowing.  Very nice.  Oh, you met him.  He was very sweet.  Wow.  That's nice.  You got a scene with...  It was intimidating, though, because we shot in Williamsburg in Brooklyn, and I'm dressed  as Hasidim, and I don't want to tick people. 
[02:44:00]  I don't like insulting people, really.  I thought they're going to kill me for thinking that I'm mocking them for being Hasidim, but I  was Hasidic.  So what did you say to De Niro?  He just held me up at gunpoint.  He goes, give me ten minutes to get out of here, right?  So I'm just, like, shaking like a leaf.  I didn't talk, but he...  He didn't talk.  But you have a scene with De Niro.  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  No, I didn't...  You know what?  I talked to him a little bit, but he loves comedy.  He's just really laid back, you know?  It's like...  Yeah.  I don't want to bother him.  I was just like...  I let him talk to me.  What do you mean you don't want to bother him? 
[02:44:30]  You're in a scene with him.  You have to bother him.  Yeah, but I don't feel...  I don't know.  It's weird.  How did he know you were a comedian?  No, he just started talking about comedy.  Like, he just started laughing.  It was awesome, right?  That's awesome.  My heart almost stopped, though, when I seen him on the set.  I'm like, fuck.  Hopefully he'll get another scene with him.  I was actually up for a couple of things in that, but I didn't get them.  I was in callbacks.  Right.  People are wishing that we had a burning tire for the hula hoop thing.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that's okay.  But anything for comedy, guys.  I don't know.  I just watched the video of that last night. 
[02:45:00]  Why would you watch that?  I don't know.  It was some African thing, right?  I just can't do it.  There's some guy.  He's laying in the street, and there's a big mob around him, and they're kicking him  and punching him and shit like that.  And then some guy comes up with some gas, and they pour it on him, and they're trying  to get the tire on his head, but he's fighting and pushing the tire off.  And then they light him on fire, but only the back of his head goes up, and he's running  around the street, and they're punching him more.  And then they hit him with a table, and then he gets knocked down pretty good, and they're  able to get the tire. 
[02:45:30]  And then they put a shitload of gas on him and light him on fire.  And then he's just laying on the street, and he's kind of moving around a little, totally  on fire.  His legs are moving.  It's very disturbing, isn't it?  Oh, it's terrible.  It's really terrible.  Oh.  All right, Mike.  It's nice.  I'm going to take that home with you.  Why don't you hula hoop us out of here?  Oh, yeah.  Here he goes.  He's got the hula hoop, and oof.  There's some fat guys everywhere, guys.  Uh-huh.  I hope he's getting the camera there.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Oh, it's going to... 
[02:46:00]  I don't think...  I don't see how this...  You're not putting any effort into it whatsoever.  Sorry, guys.  Just telling me...  Oh, it's lit up.  Yeah.  Now go.  Why can't...  You can't make it go around.  Yeah.  He's spinning the hoop around his neck, and it's not moving.  He's just standing there.  You've got to kind of move.  You're missing the concept.  Let's go.  Someone should...  You should be Mike.  But you've got to be able to, like, move like this.  And he's spinning his whole body with the hoop on it.  Oh, that's not how you do it. 
[02:46:30]  No, that's not how you do it, Mike.  You're missing the point of hula hoop.  You told us you could hula hoop.  Yeah, this is a hula hoop.  No, you've got to...  Like, move your head back and forth.  He spins it, and then he spins with it.  Okay, sorry, guys.  I'll back and forth?  Yeah.  Oh, damn this.  Well, after you spin it.  Oh, okay.  Hold on.  Yeah, at least you're kind of trying there.  Well, at least we're closing with a bang.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, we wish that was razor sharp.  Just counting it.  Uh, no. 
[02:47:00]  Wow.  See, you have a spadge, guys.  I told you.  He's, um...  You said you could do it with your neck.  Yeah, you said you could.  I think I'm doing it with my neck.

[02:50:00]  Pretty topy.  From his kids.  You don't remember the story?  No, but over when Mike was kidding.  Nikki, but she doesn't smell bad.  She always smells good.  Would you be surprised if it was Mike?  No.  Hi, guys.  I like the new intro, by the way.  It feels much more natural as a well-accomplished actor to be heralded as such, if I may say heralded.  All right, guys.  Call up if you want. 
[02:50:30]  And let's see here.  Molly in New York has a complicated entanglement with a married man.  Uh-oh.  Hi, Jim.  Hi, Molly.  I love you.  You're the best.  Thank you.  So I've been dating a man in his 40s.  He has two kids.  And from what I thought, a really estranged wife.  How old are you?  I'm 22.  Okay.  And I know.  I know.  And for a long time, he had been my mentor.  And last Sunday, she called me and slipped out. 
[02:51:00]  But to be honest, most of the things she had to say, they weren't bad about me.  They were all about him.  They were about how he refused to go, you know, to AA to seek any counseling for his alcoholism.  He doesn't really drink around me, but I guess he's really made an issue around her.  And as much as I feel like I should be heeding this warning and advice, I don't feel ready to give up on it yet.  Well, what is there to give up on?  Let's be very honest.  He's married.  You obviously, even if he doesn't drink a lot around you, I guarantee you, the personality. 
[02:51:30]  Who in your life was a drinker when you were a kid?  Was your father?  My dad, yeah.  Okay, of course you would.  So what's happening is you know this is Daddy Issues 101.  You don't have to be a genius to figure that out.  So he's an alcoholic, probably like your dad was.  And you're just trying to, like, resolve whatever shit you didn't resolve with your dad with this guy.  It's not going to go anywhere.  It's not.  Okay.  You're trying to go out and find another guy.  Not that he's a terrible guy, but he's got a life already.  Why don't you go out and find another guy?  I think part of what's really been holding me back is that he helps me a lot sort of in my career. 
[02:52:00]  We're in the same industry.  He does help me a lot with work.  We both work in the journalism field.  Okay.  And part of that, I feel like because he's helped me so much in my professional life that I owe him something in his personal life to help him get it together.  And that's what's really difficult is whenever he says, well, I don't drink around you.  You make me feel better about that.  I feel like I owe it to him to be in his life.  Well, no, you don't owe it to him. 
[02:52:30]  And you're not doing it for that reason.  You're doing it to resolve your own stuff.  You may be telling yourself, I'm doing it because I want to be good to him and I owe it to him because that's a safer answer than, wow, I fell right into every cliche.  Like, you know what I mean?  We never want to think that we fall into every cliche that we should have avoided.  But, you know, what you want to work on is the adult child of an alcoholic issues because those are big ones.  You know, when you grow up with someone who's a drinker or whatever, it affects you a lot.  So my suggestion would be to stop with this shit and work on your own ACLA stuff. 
[02:53:00]  That's my suggestion.  And you never speak to him?  No, I would say never speak to him.  But, you know, look, he's still with his wife.  She called you.  That's the warning shot.  If you legitimately didn't know, okay, that happens to people.  You had a warning shot fired across the bridge.  Now you have to heed it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  I feel a little bit better.  All right.  Good luck.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Take care.  Let's see here. 
[02:53:30]  I don't know if I'm an alcoholic.  Can you tell me?  It's, you know, Anthony in Long Island.  No, I'm kidding.  Hello.  Bob in New Mexico.  How are you?  Good morning, Jim.  How's it going?  I'm good, buddy.  How are you?  Good.  Yeah, I've been kind of thinking back and forth with if I'm an alcoholic or not.  I work six nights a week, but the one night I do get off, I drink like a fish, you know,  10, 12 beers and come home, pass out, go to work the next day.  Like, any other day of the week, if I have a beer, it's like one, I may or may not finish 
[02:54:00]  it, but...  You might be what they call, by the way, excuse me, you might be what they call a periodic,  where there are guys that will binge drink for like weeks at a time, and then there are  periodics who can just do it occasionally or when they do it.  Like, you know, you're a functional guy.  You can, you know, work all week and this and that, but when you get a chance, you fucking  suck down 10 or 12.  Honestly, dude, my experience, normal people don't do that.  Okay. 
[02:54:30]  Most normal people, most non-problem drinkers do not suck down 12 beers on their day off.  Okay.  Is it something I should maybe look at going to meetings for?  Well, you might want to look up a 12-step group.  Well, I mean, you know, and again, most people I've experienced don't think I might be an  alcoholic until they usually are.  Um, I'm not saying never, but I haven't met a lot of people who thought about going to  meetings or thought about being an alcoholic if they weren't.  So you might already know the answer and you just want a confirmation, but why don't you 
[02:55:00]  look up a 12-step group in New Mexico in your area and, uh, go to a few meetings and talk  to a few people.  You have zero to lose by doing that.  Sure.  You know, I think they'll be able to tell you and you'll be able to answer the question  yourself, but I think you already know the answer to it.  Yeah, I kind of do.  Yeah.  Maybe you're not an alcoholic, like a Bowery bum, but it's, it's, it's obviously a problem  for you and, uh, you know, it's good that you recognize it, man.  So, you know, try going to a meeting and see what they have to say and, uh, see if you can 
[02:55:30]  relate to anybody there.  Okay.  Okay.  Will do.  Thank you, Jim.  Okay, buddy.  Good luck, man.  What's that?  Looking forward to you coming down here sometime.  Thank you, man.  Yeah.  I'd love to get to New Mexico actually.  Thanks, Bob.  Yeah.  Wayne in Alabama, my wife says, I'm not affectionate enough, so we don't have sex, then complains  we don't have sex.  Yes.  Damned if you do.  Damned if you don't.  Wayne, what's up?  Yeah.  It's, I've been married about five years and this, over the last six months, it's just kind  of gotten to the point where, you know, she's, you know, I don't hold her hand enough or 
[02:56:00]  I don't do this and that.  And then I got to the point where I've tried to make an effort over the last couple months  to do that and then it's just, oh, you're just trying to have sex with me.  Oh, you're just doing this to have, you know, so I just get in this kind of circle of, you  know, like you said, Damned if you do, Damned if you don't, to where if I start trying to  be affectionate enough or, you know, start rubbing her back or hold her hand in public  or something like that, it's always like, hey, you're just trying to, you want to have  sex when we get home.  Why is she being so, why is she giving you shit and then calling you out? 
[02:56:30]  I have no fucking clue.  That's what I'm concerned about.  I don't know if, you know, if it's some of her friends at work or, you know, if, because  a lot, a lot of her friends are, you know, I guess I want to say newlyweds, but, you  know, they're less than two years into it.  And so I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but it's, it's getting, it's  getting frustrating on my end.  How long have you guys been together?  Sorry to interrupt you.  No, we've been married five years and we've been together probably eight.  You have kids?  We have one.  Yeah.  We have a two year old.  Do you think she's getting, do you think she has like a secret 
[02:57:00]  resentment against you?  Like, uh, or she's sick of you?  I don't, I don't think so because I mean, when we have sex, it's, it's, it's great, but  it's, it's just the point of getting that.  I don't know if she's kind of, you know, involved in like a Nicholas Sparks novel or, or something  that some unreasonable expectation of what she thinks of, of me.  Well, did you ask her what she wants?  Sometimes if you say to a person, like if you tell her what you just told me nicely,  like, look, you said we don't have, uh, I'm not affectionate enough and then I hold your 
[02:57:30]  hand and then you use that to accuse me of only trying to do it to have sex with you.  So what is it you really want?  Sometimes you have to ask a person and then they realize they've been a little unreasonable.  Yeah.  I would suggest asking her.  Yeah.  I'm, um, yeah, because I've, and I've, I've took it the wrong way.  I've been passive aggressive and things.  I've said stuff that's probably rubbed her the wrong way when I, when I have done that.  So I guess probably being, you know, a lot less passive aggressive and kind of coming  at straight forward with it.  Yeah.  Just ask her cause she might not even know she's doing it. 
[02:58:00]  Sometimes people are shitty and they don't even realize they're being shitty.  So, um, you know, I would suggest asking her nicely cause if you accuse someone, they  get defensive and you don't get anything done.  I know cause that's all I've ever done in my life.  Yeah.  And that's the thing I, and I'm trying to look inwardly if it's, if it's myself, if  I, if I have been less affectionate.  Cause I mean, over the course of eight years, I grant, I guarantee it's not like it was  when we were in college, but at the same time, I mean, I still do stuff for her and try  to do things, you know, nice things for her.  And the kid really hasn't affected our relationship or sex that much. 
[02:58:30]  So, I don't know, but yeah, I'll try to take a little more direct approach.  Okay, buddy.  All right, man.  I'll see you next month in Atlanta.  I'm making the trip over.  Thank you, Wayne.  Good luck, man.  Okay.  All right.  Bye, man.  Okay.  Hi, Danny in Chicago, a long distance relationship.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, buddy?  I really loved the degenerate show on Netflix.  It was wonderful.  American degenerate.  Thank you, buddy.  What's up?  Yeah.  Great job.  Me and my girlfriend, we've been dating now for just about a year now.  And I went to move out to LA for school for a year, and she still lives in Chicago. 
[02:59:00]  And just going through the long distance thing, and it's always trouble because she's always  busy and I'm always busy.  And I'm just always curious, how would you handle that?  And what advice do you have for a long distance thing?  Well, how I would handle it and my advice are different.  I would probably cheat and ruin the relationship.  My advice would be to just try to find times to connect.  How often do you see each other?  Oh, we try to see each other like once a month.  But we're both really super busy. 
[02:59:30]  We're both architects.  So it's always traveling back and forth.  How long will you be apart for?  Will you eventually have a time where you're not?  Well, that's another thing I want to ask.  I don't know if I should tell her maybe we should both look for jobs out in California  for now or pick a different city or something.  Well, do you want to be fucked anyone else?  No, no.  And you don't think she has?  No, I don't think so.  All right.  That's that Chicago Midwestern thing, I think.  Because long distance relationships do survive. 
[03:00:00]  People go in the military, people go away for school.  I mean, they're very doable.  I would say you probably don't want it to be a permanent long distance thing.  But if you guys have an idea of when you'll be able to actually live together or whatever  or be in the same city, I would just suggest finding times where you could talk.  I mean, if it's working, it's working.  Yeah, that's true.  Do you think that you have any other advice for keeping her happy and all that stuff?  No, because I don't know her.  I don't know what she wants.  Again, I think a lot of times all people want is to know that they're not being forgotten. 
[03:00:30]  With text messaging, it's a lot easier, too.  You can text all day.  You can keep in touch and chat.  It's a lot easier to stay connected now with the technology.  So just make sure that she knows you're thinking of her.  And I think most women would like to know that, that you're not out of fucking other girls.  Well, that's perfect advice.  I do send her flowers every once in a while, and I think that makes her feel good.  All right, yeah.  And tell her, look, I'm sorry I fucked your friend, even if you didn't.  All right, good luck, buddy.  All right, thanks so much.  Take care.  Hello, John in New Jersey, who quit drinking a while ago and started again. 
[03:01:00]  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I'm doing pretty good.  Well, considering I started drinking again.  How long had you stopped?  I stopped for like 18 years.  I had two DWIs.  Wow.  I crashed into a tree, got totally fucked up from it, and lost my job.  It took me a while to get back on my feet.  Now I'm back on my feet, married and everything.  And I just started drinking like a year ago.  I had like over 18 years sobriety.  So things are going a little too well sometimes. 
[03:01:30]  And they say that people in recovery, a lot of times we're in danger when things are going well  because we get complacent and we forget exactly the penalty for doing that.  Like, ah, you know what?  I can have a drink.  Do you still go to any type of 12-step group?  No.  See, when I quit the first, when I quit 18 years, I didn't go to any 12-step program at all.  I did it on my own.  And I didn't, I still hung out with the same friends and stuff.  And I didn't relapse because of my friends.  It was, it's just like a chain of events where I got injured, started with prescription meds, 
[03:02:00]  and then just one thing led to another and I started drinking again.  Well, did you ever think of going to meetings now of some sort?  I am, like, vehemently against meetings for myself.  I'm not saying it won't work for me.  I'm happy that they're out there for other people that are at work.  What is it about them in general that you're against?  Um, it's, you know, I'd probably go there and I probably would think that I'm not as bad as the people that are there. 
[03:02:30]  Sure.  The stories that they have would, like, you know, trump mine hands down, you know?  Right.  And that's, by the way, that's, and you're, in some cases you're right, in some cases you're not.  But don't, that's the way alcoholics think.  Like, instead of looking at that and going, being grateful and going, wow, I'm really glad I didn't do that.  Like, or thank God that didn't happen to me yet.  We look at it like, ah, fuck it.  See, that's not me.  Like, you know, they say identify, don't compare.  Because whenever you compare stories, you're going to find a million differences. 
[03:03:00]  But it's identifying with the stuff that connects you.  Whether it's the stuff that causes us to drink or, you know, the way we bury feelings or the way we avoid things  or the way we handle anger or whatever it is you identify with.  And I find that to be a lot more helpful than comparing and looking for the differences.  Have you ever come close to falling off the wagon at all?  Sure I have.  Of course.  They say, you know, there are times where everyone in recovery comes close.  And I may never know how close I was. 
[03:03:30]  You know what I mean?  Like, I may never know.  But they say you're only an arm's length away.  And that sounds like a corny fucking dumb little slogan or bumper sticker.  But it's the truth.  Like, I've actually thought of that when I was – because I'm around booze all the time because of my job.  Yeah.  I'm like, I could pick this up and throw 25 years out.  Like, I'm that close.  The idea is, like, boom.  In the time it just took me to say that to you, I could end 25 or 26 years of sobriety.  So I'm never going –  I ended 18.  I know it. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  And it happened.  And, you know, dude, if you've had 18 years of sobriety, if you've got DWIs,  you understand what this is and you understand what it does to you.  So why go through this alone?  Why not try to find meetings?  Instead of anticipating how you're going to react,  why don't you realize that you tried it on your own,  now you're drinking again, and maybe you need a little extra help?  But do you know the percentages of people who stop with the help of the program? 
[03:04:30]  I do not.  I honestly don't.  I never thought about it.  I never cared.  I imagine it's low, but not as low as people who do it on their own.  Because I remember reading about – or just – it could have been your word of mouth.  It said the percentages were almost the same, and that's one thing that stuck with me.  I'm going to probably have to do more research on that to see if it is like that.  But instead of doing research, like instead of finding reasons as to why not to go,  which is all research is because you're not looking for research to support going, 
[03:05:00]  why don't you just take a good action, which is to go to it and see if it's for you.  Like what have you lost?  Say you go for a couple of months or you go to a few meetings.  What have you lost?  You've lost nothing.  Yeah, nothing.  Right now, you know where you're going to end up.  You got drunk drivings already.  It's worse now than it was 18 years ago.  They're going to get you again.  And nobody plows into a fucking family or a kid until they plow into a family or a kid.  And nobody wants to hear, I had 18 years and then I fucked up, when you run somebody over. 
[03:05:30]  Then it's too late, man.  The game is over.  Right now, you haven't.  What's that, buddy?  That's unacceptable in my book.  But you know what I'm saying?  That happens all the fucking time.  Like whenever I hear about drunk drivers killing people, yeah, I'm disgusted with them.  But I'm like, oh my fucking God, am I glad that's not me?  Because I am no better than those people.  When I'm drinking, I'm an irrational asshole.  And I would do that. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  Your insight's very positive.  Just try it, dude.  It's not going to hurt you.  It costs you nothing.  You don't have to give your name.  You don't have to give them.  You have to sign up for a fucking thing.  Just try it.  If you don't like it, you don't like it.  All right.  I appreciate it, Jimmy.  Good luck, man.  But get back on track.  18 years.  You can do it if you want to.  All right.  Thank you.  Okay.  Good luck with yours.  Thank you, buddy.  Hi, Tom in New Jersey.  Let's talk about your interest in trannies.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, I actually got a lot of my information from when you talk about things all the time. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, good.  Bad news, I'm sorry.  No, no, it's not.  I have a girlfriend.  So I don't think that I'm homosexual.  No.  But, you know, I'm definitely interested in, you know, having my experience with a transsexual.  Okay.  Um, you know, I mean, you know, the things that you talk about, I mean, are they all  like joke stuff or, I mean, are they serious?  I mean, is this something that, like, you know, I could possibly be interested in, you 
[03:07:00]  think?  Well, you can answer that.  For my jokes, some are true, some are exaggeration, some are false.  It all depends on the particular joke.  Sometimes you're just being silly.  Sometimes you're being, you know, really, it does cover the entire spectrum.  But for yourself, you have to answer that question.  How long have you been with the girl?  Uh, about a year.  I mean, I would suggest not doing it while you're in a relationship.  A, because you're cheating.  B, you could catch something. 
[03:07:30]  And C, then you have to look at her and know you did something dishonest in the relationship.  And you might, like, if you're single and you want to try it, then try it.  But I mean, uh, for now, why don't you just jerk off thinking about it?  Do you watch tranny porn?  Yeah.  And, uh, does she watch it with you?  No, she doesn't know.  I think that's the greatest killer in relationships.  Shame over what we like sexually.  Shame over what we fantasize about.  Like, again, there's plenty of women that have rape fantasies.  They don't want to be raped.  They just like the fantasy. 
[03:08:00]  Um, you know, to me, as long as you're not, again, I have, you know, the line for me is  kids and animals.  Like, I know that this sounds like, well, that's everyone's line, but there are people that  really fantasize about that shit.  Um, that I think is truly, truly unhealthy.  But most of the other stuff, uh, it's amazing the shame we have.  I'm not saying tell your girlfriend, she might leave you, but it's, it's amazing in relationships  how much we hide from each other because we're embarrassed or we're afraid of how the other  person's going to react.  I'm in a place now, I mean, I'm single and I date here and there, you know, it's, but 
[03:08:30]  I've had no real relationships, but I don't care if a girl I start seeing is approves of  what I like or not.  I don't care.  Like, she may not have, she may not like it and it may cost us a relationship, but I'm  not going to apologize for who I am and what I like and you shouldn't either.  Right, right.  Yeah, no, my, my, my whole thing is like, you know, I'm just worried about like, like  you said, like, you know, if I were to, uh, you know, to venture out and, and, and try  it is, uh, it's catching something. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, you don't want to do that.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I mean, you know, how do you, you know, how do you, how do you gauge, you know, you  never truly know, but I mean, you know, it could happen anytime.  I can meet some, I can meet a woman in a club and I could cut something, you know, I mean.  Absolutely.  That's why you should probably stay faithful if you're in a relationship because I've  cheated and always regretted it.  I never felt good about cheating.  All right.  Right.  Right.  Just check off thinking about it for now.  Thanks, buddy.  All right, man.  You know, cause the problem is this guy has a little bit of a dilemma.  I mean, it's one of those things.  I mean, I mean, a guy's winter dilemma typically is that, you know, all right, she wants to 
[03:09:30]  bundle up.  You want to see some skin.  That's the problem.  Right.  So how do you have a, uh, I take care, man, cause I'm just thinking about, uh, I, you know,  how do you have a hot holiday when she's always cold?  I don't know how you do it.  Pajama Graham can definitely help.  Maybe not that man's problem, but in general, heat up Christmas for Pete's sake, get your wife  a girlfriend or lady partner, a hoodie footie at pajama Graham.com.  It combines the warmth of a hoodie with the coziness of footie pajamas.  Women love a footie pajama. 
[03:10:00]  That sound they make on the floor.  It's adorable.  Head to toe warmth means she's going to be hot in no time.  Ah, it's made of soft microfleece.  It has zip off feet just in case you have a foot fetish.  Let's say her feet are cold and you have a foot fetish.

[03:11:30]  Hello, John.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah.  I've been in recovery for 14 years.  Okay.  And I moved.  I lost my house in Sandy and I moved out.  So I stopped going to meetings, I guess.  And I guess that's going to be the ultimate answer.  But, you know, I've been listening for a while.  I love listening to it, you know, on the show.  Thank you.  One of the things I was going to ask you was, don't you think that you're breaking traditions by doing this? 
[03:12:00]  No, not at all.  And I'll tell you why.  I believe you.  I'm very, very conscious of that.  Never once have I ever endorsed publicly a particular group.  I suggest people go to 12-step meetings.  I have never named a 12-step meeting.  I have never affiliated myself with a 12-step group.  So no, I'm not.  Don't you think you're just going around the back door with it?  No, I think I'm answering.  But you use every terminology that's used in an AA meeting. 
[03:12:30]  So what?  Well, I mean, I just think it's breaking tradition.  No, but you're asking me if I think I am.  And I'm telling you, no, I don't.  Because I suggest 12-step meetings for people.  And so what if I use the terminology?  Any 12-step group does not own the terminology.  It's been associated with one, but I'm sure therapists use it too.  And I tell people to go online, find a 12-step group, and see if it's for them.  So isn't it attraction more than promotion?  Yes. 
[03:13:00]  That's why when people call...  No.  You're promoting it.  No, I'm really not.  You're promoting meetings.  Yes.  I think you are.  No, dude, I'm not.  I think you are.  I mean, you're promoting meetings.  You're promoting...  Go to computers and figure out a meeting.  What other meetings are you going to go to?  There are absolutely other groups.  There are absolutely...  I don't know.  I don't endorse them either.  I've never heard of them.  All right.  Okay.  Well, then why don't you do this?  Look online and look for... 
[03:13:30]  So what am I supposed to do if I'm giving an advice show and somebody says, what do I do?  I have a drinking problem.  Go get help.  Okay.  What does that mean?  They people know what that means.  Oh.  So if I say...  Hold on.  Hold on.  If I say go get help and they know what that means, isn't that a traditions break?  No.  Why not?  Because you didn't say go to a 12-step program.  Oh, okay.  So I should talk in...  Hold on.  I should talk in code one step removed from the code I'm talking in. 
[03:14:00]  No.  I mean, you could say things like go to a therapist.  I have said that.  I have said that.  Well, you've also said go to a 12-step program.  Because I think for drinking, honestly, dude, I think for drinking...  I don't need to argue about you because, listen, I respect your sobriety tremendously.  You know, you got 25 years of sobriety.  So that's why I called up.  You know, I was thinking about it and I'm saying, wait a minute, isn't this breaking tradition?  And I understand, John, I do understand why you're asking me that. 
[03:14:30]  But I'm telling you why I don't think it is.  You may think it's a tradition break.  That's cool for you to think that.  But I know I'm not breaking tradition.  Believe me.  I'll say this.  I had a debate with a comedian on here one time about 12-step meetings.  And there were plenty of personal examples I could have given.  But did not because it would have been an anonymity break.  And it would have been a traditions break.  And I respect the traditions tremendously.  And I hate when people write books and put the certain names of certain groups in there. 
[03:15:00]  It drives me fucking nuts.  But it never bothers me when somebody says 12-step or this and that.  You know.  But anyway, we disagree about that.  But if you're thinking...  That's all right.  Yeah, yeah.  John, why are you thinking about drinking?  Well, you know, I think it's because I haven't gone to meetings.  I think that's the focus of it.  I've left my comfort zone.  Yeah.  And, you know, that comfort zone of my home group and my guys and my, you know, that... 
[03:15:30]  And I moved...  You know, I don't want to say I moved 100 miles away.  And I'm in, like, you know, Boise, Idaho or something.  You know, I moved, you know, 20, 25, half an hour away.  And I guess I'm using those excuses to say, you know, it's Saturday night.  I don't want to go to my home group.  Or, you know, I just worked all day at 7 o'clock.  And I got to go to my home group at night and on Wednesday.  You know, things like that.  I just... I'm using it.  And I should be plugged in probably closer to my house.  John, believe me, I understand that. 
[03:16:00]  I've used every excuse, too.  Even if I'm here in the city and I know I can go right down the street, I get lazy.  You know, Jim Norton is Jim Norton no matter where I am.  And I can make an excuse to avoid one that's 25 minutes away.  And I can make an excuse to avoid one that's five blocks away.  But you're right.  You know what you're doing is playing on the tracks.  And, you know, they say a drink is the end of a slip, not the beginning.  That's the final moment in a slip is a drink. 
[03:16:30]  And I've been real close at times, I'm sure.  I'm sure that some higher power, whatever it is, I don't even know at this point, looked out for me.  I would just suggest, as you know, to go back to what it is that worked for you.  Because, you know, I mean, do you really need to go through what got you to getting sober to begin with?  No.  I mean, listen, you know, I love the program.  I mean, it saved my life.  And, you know, if it wasn't for that, I would have been dead. 
[03:17:00]  You know, so I know that.  I'm not, you know, like I'm not a stupid person.  Right.  It's, you know, and I don't want to get emotional or anything like that.  But I just, you know, I know how much that it has.  And I hear people call up a lot of times, and especially the other guy, you know, like, oh, should I go or shouldn't I go?  And I played that game for years, you know, that stupid game of like, it's not me.  Or I remember telling people I'm not an alcoholic because I don't drink coffee and smoke cigarettes, you know, because that's all the people did, you know. 
[03:17:30]  And I don't, and I used to, I come up with, I could come up with every fucking excuse in the world and accept the right excuse, which is when I put drug trap on my system, I'm a different person and it causes problems.  And that's the fucking simple, simplest thing I can think of.  I lose control every time I do it.  I lose control.  And I know how I was and I know what would happen.  And you said something about like, I know the right answer.  And I heard a guy in 1989.  I remember his name was Ted. 
[03:18:00]  I believe I remember where I was when he said it.  And he said, knowledge is no defense against the first drink.  Knowing things are really good, but knowledge will never stop me from doing it.  It is what my actions are.  So my suggestion would be like, dude, you're having, you're on the cliff, but you haven't jumped off the cliff.  You pick up the phone.  You know the answer.  So, you know, all you got to do, Matt, is take the right action and go to where you need to go.  And you know where you need to go. 
[03:18:30]  I know.  I appreciate it.  I love you, Jimmy.  And I just, I just wanted to ask that question about, I don't mean a confrontation.  We're two, we're two alcoholics.  That's probably the nicest confrontation we could have had.  It's not, just call back next week, though, man, and try to go this week, all right?  All right, brother.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Take care.  Good luck, buddy.  All right.  Let's see here.  Ah, JC and NC wants to know what I did to quit smoking.  Hey, Jim.  I would, I would light a cigarette and put it out in my dick hole.  That's what I'm going to give really awful advice.  No, I'll tell you what I did. 
[03:19:00]  I had a moment of clarity.  It was a WNEW.  And I've told the story before, so forgive my redundancy.  And Anthony, I said, I'm going to quit smoking.  And I had a pack of parliaments.  I said, I'm going to finish the pack.  And Anthony scolded me.  He goes, oh, shut up.  Just throw them out.  Get rid of them.  So I said, he's right.  So I threw my cigarettes out.  I kept one left.  I went into the hallway.  I smoked my last parliament.  I went down to the comedy cellar.  Smoking was still allowed back then.  It's December of 2001. 
[03:19:30]  December 7th, I think.  Esty, who is the booker of the comedy cellar, said, you know, in her Israeli accent, I'm  going to take you.  And she took me, right, that's a terrible Esty impression, but she took me to the fucking  pharmacy and got me the patch.  And I did, however long the patch was, three weeks or whatever, I did it as it was prescribed.  And I'm not a do-it-as-prescribed person.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Do it for a week and then do it my way because I know better because I'm arrogant.  But I did it as it was prescribed and I quit smoking. 
[03:20:00]  And I used Colin Quinn, who's a terrible person, but he said the most important thing.  And I've repeated it and I'll say it again.  The urge to smoking will pass whether you smoke or not.  It will pass.  So do either the patch or maybe an e-cigarette or whatever the fuck these things are called.  You can quit.  You know that?  Yeah.  And I mean, I've done the patch before twice all the way through and stayed quit for maybe  a couple of months after that.  But then I'll just have one trigger that hits me.  And I was kind of wondering, like, what you would do when you had triggers hit you that 
[03:20:30]  would be able to, that you would do to pacify that or to mitigate the effect of that trigger?  One minute at a time, the day at a time for drinking or drugs or eating, you know, you  can do it an hour at a time, dude.  You can do it 10 minutes at a time if you have to.  And sometimes you've got to think it through.  Think a cigarette through.  Think of the breath.  Think of the fucking, think of having a fucking piece of your jaw taken off.  That's what scared me.  It wasn't dying because dying is this intangible thing. 
[03:21:00]  It's going through life drooling into a fucking bag or trying to eat pussy with no tongue.  Like literally trying to lose your ability to taste food because your tongue has been removed.  Think it through and just avoid the first one.  All you've got to avoid is the first cigarette.  Right.  And it will pass.  I promise you it will pass.  But just go through it now.  Go, fuck New Year's.  Go through the holidays.  Tough it out.  And realize that you'll never have to go through the initial Jones again.  If you get it out of the way this time, this will be the last time you ever have to go 
[03:21:30]  through it.  Great, man.  All right.  I appreciate it.  Good luck, man.  Quitting smoking is such a great thing that I did.  Um, okay.  Let's see.  Uh, uh, Johnny Connecticut.  Let's lighten up.  I'm a standup comedian and would like some comedy advice.  Well, you've called the right person.  I hope so, Jimmy.  Hi, John.  How are you doing, man?  Hey, listen.  I have a couple things.  Um, I have about an hour.  I've been doing comedy about four years and I'm reasonably successful where I'm at. 
[03:22:00]  I'm in Connecticut.  Okay.  And, uh, I've got to do some cool things, but I feel like I'm going to downslide.  Why?  I feel like she's not picking up.  I'm not as broken as much and, uh, I haven't been able to crack New York.  I mean, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've headlined, I've headlined rooms in Boston for guys that  you probably know, but I just, I, uh, I don't know.  I, I don't know what the writing, I feel like I'm in a slump and I want to know how you  write something like that out.  Cause you can put a special together in a year or less than a year.  That's amazes me.  Well, honestly, the way I do that is, and I, John, I didn't do that job. 
[03:22:30]  I'm sorry.  What's your name?  It's, uh, uh, uh, Oh, John.  Sorry.  There's a lot of John.  Yeah, that's John.  I didn't do that right away for years.  I would struggle with coming up with new material.  Five minutes seemed like forever.  And then you put together your 10 minutes and your headline.  And eventually the more confident I got on stage and I'm on stage every night in New  York.  So when you're doing a 45 minute headline set, it's kind of hard when you, you know, until  you have a little bit of a name for yourself to just go up there and riff 10 minutes  of it, because if you bomb, they turn on you and you don't have the power of like, 
[03:23:00]  God, they're here to see me.  So it could be an ugly show.  And I've had plenty of it.  So when I'm doing shorter sets, like in New York, you have 15 minutes or 12 minutes or  20 minutes.  So there's a lot less pressure and everybody after you is doing 20 minutes.  So you can go up there and explore for 10 minutes and then eventually work that into  the act.  So that was how I started to do it.  And then I got to a position where people came out to see me and I can go out and do  these.  Like I'm doing this Mount of Kisco, New York shows this weekend and I have most of my 
[03:23:30]  new hour together, but I'm still playing with the terminology and the order, you know,  so I do cheap tickets and I work it like that.  But I almost feel like, I don't feel like I'm more afraid of bombing now with new shit  than I was when I started.  Sure.  Because you have something to lose now.  You feel like you're a little established.  And the last thing you want when you start to feel good about yourself as a comedian  is something to remind us of how scary this really is.  You know, once in a while, after all these years, I'll bomb at the Comedy Cellar or some 
[03:24:00]  other room.  And it's usually not headlining, but I'll go up and take a fat dick and I'll go, oh my  fucking God, was that scary.  Once in a while, I remember this was a few years ago, I was warming up for the Jay Leno  show.  I was doing this, it was a stupid thing I did on flying.  It was like a segment called, you know, the uninvited guest.  So I went on this room in the village, it was not the Comedy Cellar, to try this material.  And I bombed so fucking horribly.  And I bombed in a way that I couldn't get out of it. 
[03:24:30]  Like, if I'm bombing now, I usually have a bunch of rabbits I can pull out of the fucking  hat after all these years to make it salvageable.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, I learned the little tricks and you learn like the fucking when to laugh at my own  joke, just to pull a dumb fucking salvageable fucking non-humiliating experience out of  the thing, whatever.  This was one that nothing I did worked.  And none of my experience meant anything.  I was an open miker again, eating my fucking cock in a room and nobody cared about me. 
[03:25:00]  And I walked out of that room and I was shaking up, man.  And it was good to have those.  It's good to have those.  I know there's a question back to reality and I got to, you know, the open mic guys  in the first place, and you probably do it at a higher level with the resentment.  There's a little bit of bullshit that comes with that where I think they want to see you  flop on your head, too.  Sure, maybe they do.  But fuck the open mic guys and fuck the other comics because they're not the ones who pay  your rent.  They're not the ones standing on stage when you're fucking eating your balls at the fucking 
[03:25:30]  Comedy Connection.  You know what I mean?  It's got to be you.  And you have to go on.  And you going on and working on new material and open mics, that would inspire some comics,  too.  They'd be like, wow, this guy's making a living and he's coming on and working on new  material.  But regardless of how they feel, I would suggest doing some open mics, get on stage more than  you're getting on, do some free shows and go on and take some risks and tape it.  And, dude, that's part of the fun of what we do is we go up there and take risks. 
[03:26:00]  Before you let me go, I want you to know you were the inspiration for me to get on stage  the first time.  Oh, thank you, man.  That's a great honor.  You were the one who said stop.  And you told another guy to stop being a pussy and get up on stage and stop being afraid  of it.  And I did it.  And it's been successful.  So I really appreciate it.  Well, thank you, man.  And I can't wait to be in Connecticut, man.  As the years have gone on, people have told me that just because of my length of time  in the business.  You know, eventually people, I guess, the younger guys come up.  So thank you, man.  That's a great, great compliment from another comedian.  I appreciate it.  Good luck, man.  I appreciate you, man.  Thank you.  Justin in Ohio has a problem cheating on his gal. 
[03:26:30]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, Justin.  I don't know if you, are you able to hear me?  Yes, I am.  Okay.  Hey, I don't know if you remember my phone call.  It was a time that O&A were out and you and Bobby decided to take some phone calls.  And that was over the summer.  And at the time, if you remember the story, my story is that I was a perpetual adulterer.  Sure.  And I remember one thing that he said to me that still resonates to me to this day is 
[03:27:00]  that if you remember the story, there was one of the girls that I got involved with.  She ended up calling my fiance and telling her of my past with other women, but didn't  actually admit to herself being one of them.  Okay.  And there was a statement that you made that, look, dude, you've skated all this time and  that you actually just need to stop.  And unfortunately, that wasn't enough for me.  And it's actually not unfortunate in hindsight because in doing so, I was ultimately discovered 
[03:27:30]  cheating.  And I had to confess, mind you, the numbers were a little bit skewed when I presented it  to her because I think it would have just devastated her had I presented everything.  Sure, sure.  And by me saying that, I guess the purpose of this call is to give a follow-up update and  maybe see the positive in this.  And the positive is that after I was discovered, we began to go to counseling and really got  down to the true root cause of why I was behaving the way that I was. 
[03:28:00]  And a lot of it was problems within our relationship and the holds within our relationship.  And I don't think that our relationship would have gone up to where it is today or where  it was prior to yesterday and that we were actually beginning to work things out.  A lot of my acting out stemmed from her inability to control her temper.  And if you remember me, I listened to the radio bit and I cringed at myself. 
[03:28:30]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second.  Did you, do you think that part of your acting out was her inability to control her temper?  Absolutely.  Now, have you cheated on her since?  Yes.  Now, when did you cheat on her again?  Um, it was probably a month and a half after I was discovered.  I'd been going through to, uh, an essay meeting and go spending $120 a week on a counselor.  And I know what, how I regress and get to the point where I do end up acting out again 
[03:29:00]  is my disconnection from her.  And that was when, um, at the time she was, um, just refusing affection from me and kind  of was just extra angry and blamed it on my, um, infidelity.  Justin, let me jump in for a second, buddy, because I understand that like her having a  temper is kind of cunty and it's annoying and I would hate it and it would make me want 
[03:29:30]  to go out and fuck other girls, but be careful of one trap that we fall into.  And I say we, cause I do too.  You can't, when something's addictive behavior, we, other things trigger our behavior, but we  can't blame outside entities for my problem.  Believe me, dude, I love passing blame, but I do the, I drank and I cheat because I want  to cheat and that's it.  I want to act out sexually.  So I do, because if I start putting my kid, my, like my sexual sobriety or my real sobriety 
[03:30:00]  or whatever my dreams are on other things, other things are always going to fail me.  So I'm building in an excuse to go out and do that shit.  Do you know what I mean?  Like other people will always do something to quote unquote trigger me.  It's what I do with it that counts.  So don't blame her temper, even though her temper might suck.  That's not why you act out.  You're absolutely right.  And it isn't, there is, there is something to blame for it and it isn't other people's 
[03:30:30]  actions and it isn't, it's like you said, how you deal with the stress.  Sure.  And mine actually stems from way deeper than that.  Mine stems from the fact that I had significant loss as a child and I just protect myself and  I see that her anger as a potential threat.  And therefore I need to seek other women to, um, I guess, get the validation or the connection  or whatever it is that I'm, that I need. 
[03:31:00]  And I, I completely understand that.  So, uh, yesterday what happened was, um, she was looking on my tablet and discovered that  I was again soliciting these girls online.  Um, and, but there was a very distinct cut up point in which I stopped the communication,  which was the date of this month.  And that was when things started to turn around where I felt a connection with her, where  I felt we have two children together.  And one of the things that I completely resent her to this day is her temper and the way it 
[03:31:30]  affects my five-year-old daughter.  It breaks her heart and it's confusing to her.  And I don't want my kids.  Did you ever think, let me ask you a question, Justin, did you ever think, and again, blaming  each other, did you ever think that part of her temper or part of her attitude is because  deep down she knows you're cheating?  Like, no, absolutely not.  Women, women are not as stupid as we think.  I'm not, maybe, maybe not, but I'm telling you, they pick up on stuff so much more than 
[03:32:00]  we think they do.  Oh, I agree with that.  So maybe that's not the cause of her temper, but don't think that what you're doing won't  be picked up by her and cause resentment and cause her to lash out at weird times either.  Oh, no, no, no, I get that.  I get that.  I totally get that.  And, I mean, I think at this point, this is the last straw.  She had a really fucked up childhood, too.  And that's where her anger stems from, is the fact that she was, her mother married a 
[03:32:30]  man who was not the father of any of her.  Holly, too many different directions here.  What is the, now, are you going to, we have to let you go in a second, buddy, just so I  got a bunch of people on hold.  But what is the, what is it you're going to do about this?  Are you going to just stop cheating on her or are you still going to cheat until you  get caught again?  No, no, no.  I am done with the cheating.  And I don't think that the relationship is repairable at this point because she has already,  when I was discovered, I confessed to being with five different women. 
[03:33:00]  And now, you know, she was willing to try to work through that, but I went and did this  again.  You did it again.  Yeah, she gave you another chance and you did it again.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, maybe the relationship will end.  Maybe it needs to end.  I don't wish for it to end and I don't have a choice.  I have to live with my actions.  Yes, you do.  And I'm taking full accountability for it.  Okay, buddy.  All right.  Good luck, Justin.  I don't mean to cut you off.  We just got to get to a few other people, but I hope it works out, whatever's meant to 
[03:33:30]  work out, you know?  I hope she either leaves or stays, whatever's better for you.  All right?  Yeah, I appreciate it, Jimmy.  Take care, my friend.  Okay, let's see here.  Ted in Long Island has an eating problem.  Somebody's been throwing corn over his shoulder.  Hi, Ted.  No, I hate you.  No, I hate you, Jimmy.  No, no, no.  He's missing.  Not an eating disorder.  It was ED.  Oh, an ED.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You have erectile problems.  Even better. 
[03:34:00]  What's up?  Are you calling or am I just thinking this about my life?  Okay.  It's another person.  What's up, buddy?  Well, actually, what's not?  You know, 12 years or so.  You know, I'm not paying a lot of chicks.  Yeah.  But a lot of times, if I'm banging a pig or a skank or someone who doesn't really matter  to me, you know, their opinion or anything.  Your dick works great.  Oh, I think snot out of them.  But too often, I have somebody that, you know, somebody that I like, somebody that matters  that I care about. 
[03:34:30]  And not every time, but too often, it just doesn't work out.  I was wondering if you have any insight or anything.  Yeah, it's my whole life, buddy.  I'll tell you what it is or what I think it is.  It's risk factor.  I'm completely free and comfortable, whether it's somebody that's a hooker or somebody I  don't care about.  There's no risk.  There's no performance anxiety.  And typically, when I'm with somebody like that and I'm horny, I just want to get a load  off.  But a lot of times, what happens with a person I care about or I think is really beautiful 
[03:35:00]  or I love, A, I feel performance anxiety because their opinion matters.  How they feel matters.  And I also confuse love and lust.  So I don't know sometimes if I want to lay with a girl I really like and kiss her and  just touch her.  And yet she grabs my dick.  Maybe I'm not horny.  Maybe I think I'm supposed to be horny because the pretty girl grabbed my dick.  But I just want some affection.  With the ugly pig who I don't care about, I know I don't want the affection because I  wouldn't get that from her.  Do you know what I mean?  So there's a lot less confusion and a lot less risk with some pig than there is somebody 
[03:35:30]  I care about.  So a lot of times, it's just identifying what I want, which is hard.  It's difficult to always know what I want.  Sometimes I think I want sex, but I just want to lay there with someone.  And that's not easy for a guy to say.  Yeah.  So maybe that's the problem.  But don't feel ashamed when it happens.  I know it's hard.  Try to talk it out with a girl.  Because women are, first of all, every girl has had a guy have that happen to them. 
[03:36:00]  And if you talk to them, a lot of times they feel better about it because they know it's  not them.  Yeah.  I mean, I've talked about it before.  You know, it's just that the last chick I was with, you know, wasn't hearing about  it.  You know, she had her own issues.  And, you know, she made it all about her.  And it made me feel bad about it.  So that's why she's coming up again.  I had it on the wraps for a little bit.  But, you know, the last girl I was with, you know, it made me feel shitty about it. 
[03:36:30]  Well, it's all mental, dude.  Because, you know, even if you're like, I'm not thinking about it.  I'm not thinking about it.  You're thinking about it.  And then the sexual experience starts.  You're like, oh, good.  It's so hard.  Oh, wait.  Is it going to stay hard?  Oh, my God.  It's not going to stay hard.  Oh, God.  I can feel it.  I'm losing it.  My legs are getting weaker.  It becomes an obsession.  And you sabotage every experience.  But do you take Cialis and Viagra?  No.  No, I haven't thought about that, though.  Sometimes that helps because mentally you know.  Like, I've lost a rod even with a 100 milligram Viagra in me.  But it's rare. 
[03:37:00]  So I would suggest trying one of those because a lot of times that will help mentally where you feel more confident and you don't worry as much.  Yeah.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Thanks, Bill.

And I have given them as gifts to make up for my cheating.  We have five min.  What are five min?  Oh, minutes.  Okay, I'm not a good abbreviator.  I thought five min.  Now, Mike in Pennsylvania, before I put you on, 
[03:39:30]  you know, John called up and we talked about anonymity breaks.  I'm not going to argue about a specific program or its merits.  So you're saying you have resentments towards certain meetings.  Don't talk about what the meetings are.  Just tell me what your resentment is based in, if you can, in a nutshell.  Okay, Mike?  Yeah, I got you, man.  Okay, buddy, thanks.  Yeah, no, my resentment basically is...  I'm sorry, how long have you been sober? 
[03:40:00]  Yeah, I've been sober about like seven, eight years now.  Okay.  Since I met my wife, pretty much, man.  My cure of my drinking was a woman.  Okay.  Basically, my resentment was, you know, when I went to it,  hey, they substitute everything.  God, you know, they use religion, number one.  Well, hold on, hold on.  Let me just talk this through with you.  But in my experience, they do mention God, but they also say God can be good orderly direction,  group of drunks, any power greater than myself. 
[03:40:30]  So I will say this.  I've never in my life felt religion forced on me.  Not Islam, not Christianity, not Judaism.  I've never felt religion forced on me.  Yeah, maybe it was just the ones that I was trying to attend then, you know.  Okay.  It was like everyone was coming off with that, you know what I mean?  They were holding it in a church also, so, you know, that may have been the reason.  Sure.  But don't forget, church basements a lot of times are very low rent, and they donate their spaces.  A lot of times they're held in libraries or in high schools, too. 
[03:41:00]  There are all kinds of meetings.  I'm not shitting on you.  I'm just going step by step with this because I understand you got some of that.  Okay.  Go ahead, buddy.  Then, you know, the others is like, like the other guy John did say, they substitute all the, you know,  let's say the drinking and everything with smoking, sweets.  Sure.  Sure.  You know, it's like I'm sitting, I don't smoke.  So I'm sitting in a room with like about 12 tables.  They give you two tables out of the 12, you know, for non-smokers. 
[03:41:30]  And I'm sitting there choking, trying to, you know, do my thing.  But the thing that got me the most was seeing the people that were going up there, you know,  because it was like a small little city town where I was at.  And Bayonne, shitty, shitty, like I said.  And, you know, I see these people up there, and they're getting their chips.  And not even like a couple days before that on the Ave, I'm seeing them coming out of bars, you know,  half lit and shit, and going to people I know, substituting that drink with bags of weed.  All right, so Mike, the point is this. 
[03:42:00]  You're right.  There are people, they say some are sicker than others.  There are people who are full of shit.  There are people who don't do it right.  But there are enough people who aren't full of shit that really are giving people who have had their life saved.  So I know that when I'm setting myself up for it, because it sounds to me, just from what you're saying,  that you're setting yourself up for a drink.  Like, because they say between five and ten years is a really hard time, because life gets good.  We're used to not being drunk. 
[03:42:30]  You know what I mean?  Wait a second, I'm setting myself up for a drink?  By what you're doing.  It sounds to me...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Don't get me wrong, man.  Jimmy, I'm going good.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  For eight years.  I'm just saying, from before, I wound up stopping and going, and just like doing it on myself.  And I had an epiphany, basically.  I was coming back from Florida with some friends, and I woke up, and I said, I was like, you know, I'm done.  I was like, I'm going to meet the right girl, and I'm just going to stop everything, the drugs, the drinking, it all. 
[03:43:00]  And sure enough, a couple months later, you know, I met me, the right girl doesn't do anything.  I say she's the yin to my yang, because, you know, she's like the good to my evil.  And she turned me around.  Okay.  Well, I've always found I've never been able to put my being sober, it can never be, for me, contingent on outside circumstances.  But if that's what works for you, then that's what works for you.  I mean, I'm happy you're sober.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She stopped me from going to the, you know, the bars and things like that, and the others.  It's like, you know, but the thing, Jim, was I was trying, and I went to multiple ones, and just the same thing, seeing the same thing, the same people showing up there. 
[03:43:30]  And then I'm seeing them, like, you know, messed up on the app from, like, you know, days before.  And it just, like, I was like, to me, that was all a joke then.  I was like, I can't do this.  And I did it on my own.  You know, I had the, like I said, I had the little epiphany.  I don't mean to sound gay, but, you know, sure enough, it worked.  It worked for me.  And, you know, I tell people all the time, it's like, you know, it's all about you, just like you said, and how you want to do it, if you want to do it.  And me, myself, I was going to end up dead, man. 
[03:44:00]  Mike, Mike, we have to let you go, only because we only have less than a minute left.  But I'll say this.  Thanks, Jim.  I appreciate you calling.  And I'm glad you're sober.  The only concern I have is when you put it on somebody else, it's a girl, or it's a job, and that's what got me.  If that girl leaves, then what?  No, Jim, we just had a baby, man.  We're good.  We're solid.  Okay.  Well, I wish you a lot of luck.  And even if she goes, I hope that you don't blow it.  And even if she stays, I hope you don't blow it. 
[03:44:30]  Whatever is working for you, good luck, my friend.  But don't be resentful.  Well, look, you find shitty people or phony people in every avenue in life.  12-step programs are no different than fucking your work situation.  There's great people there, and there's people that aren't.  Thank you for the call, Mike.  I appreciate it.  Thanks, man.  Be well.  So you can't let those experiences turn you off from them because you're going to find that everywhere in life.  All right.  Let's just say thank you to everyone for the calls. 
[03:45:00]  The guy, Trevor in PA, we didn't get to you seeking advice on drug addiction.  I would suggest, again, either going to a therapist or a rehab if you have that problem.  12-step person, 12-step group, but disagrees with some of the group ideas about eating.  You're an overeater.  Okay.  If you agree with some of their ideas, you agree with some of their ideas.  Hopefully, you have a sponsor you can talk to.  And anyone else who wants to call back, call back next Wednesday.  No.  That's Christmas.  Oh, Christmas.  Well, I will give the gift of life.  Maybe I'll do an advice show and we won't be here. 
[03:45:30]  On Christmas, though?  Oh, you people are fucked for the next two weeks.  Well, all you guys are going to die.  Thank you for calling in.  I hope you all try to stay sober through the fucking holidays, please.  Good night, guys.  Thank you.  Jim Norton is now done dealing with your bullshit.  Thank you. </pre>
