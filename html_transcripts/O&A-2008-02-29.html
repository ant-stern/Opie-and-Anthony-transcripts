<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion centered on Anthony Cumia's recent breakup.  Patrice O'Neal, a guest in the studio, provided commentary and  "advice,"  marked by ribald humor and insults directed at Anthony's ex-girlfriend.  Strategies for Anthony to find a new partner were discussed, ranging from upscale events to the (quickly abandoned) idea of a "hot teen pajama party."  The conversation was heavily laced with profanity and sexually explicit language.

The show then transitioned to the suspension of Long Island radio DJ "Randy" for offensive comments about Mastic, a Long Island town. Opie and Anthony, along with Patrice O'Neal and T.J. Miller (also in studio), vehemently defended Randy, criticizing the station's management as "wimpy."  They discussed Mastic's reputation, referencing a map showing numerous sex offenders, and took calls from listeners largely corroborating the negative perception.  Bob Vecchio, the school board president who filed the complaint, called in, leading to a heated debate about free speech and Mastic's condition.  Opie and Anthony relentlessly mocked Vecchio and Mastic, employing crude and offensive jokes.  The segment also included the show's Black History Month tributes (presented humorously and satirically) and discussions of other radio personalities.

The show continued with further exploration of Anthony's dating woes, including suggestions like "speed effing," which Anthony rejected.  The conversation shifted to where Anthony meets women, including humorous tangents about a lesbian party in the Poconos. T.J. Miller promoted his upcoming stand-up shows.  A brief true/false game preceded a news segment covering the American prison population, a study linking childhood spanking to adult sexual problems (including discussions of masochism), and an Old Navy employee's arrest for secretly filming women.  The spanking study led to anecdotes about childhood punishments from the hosts and T.J. Miller.

A significant portion focused on a debate with Patrice O'Neal and a sex and relationship author, whose book was criticized for its focus on women's strategies.  The discussion became heated, with confrontational exchanges about gender roles, sex, power dynamics, and the relative happiness of men and women. The segment was filled with crude and sexually explicit language.  The segment concluded with further banter and a sexually charged improvised skit, along with promotions for T.J. Miller's show and the Opie and Anthony appearance in Cleveland.

The next segment delved into gender dynamics in relationships, focusing on men's and women's sexual experiences and perspectives. Patrice O'Neal and a female sex expert, Dr. Z, led the discussion, covering topics such as men's emotional vulnerability after breakups, the perceived ease with which women obtain sexual partners, men's frustrations with perceived power dynamics, differing levels of intimacy, and techniques for anal sex.  O'Neal frequently used vulgar and sexually explicit language.  Notable moments included a humorous exchange about a "dick-sucking contest" with his sister, a running gag about Dr. Z's water consumption,  O'Neal's attractiveness rating system for women, and a debate about anal sex as a "prize."  Lily briefly joined, offering opinions on penis size preferences.  T.J. Miller's mother was present, reacting nonverbally.  The segment ended with continued debate between O'Neal and Dr. Z.


A later segment featured a highly provocative back-and-forth between Anthony and Dr. Z, focusing on her book about men's interactions with women. Anthony used aggressive, sexually explicit language, challenging her views on female sexuality and evoking evolutionary psychology.  Dr. Z's partial nudity on air led to discussions about her physical attributes and cosmetic procedures.  Patrice O'Neal participated, engaging in sexually explicit banter.  The show attempted to convince Eastside Dave to be anally penetrated by Dr. Z, involving a phone call with Dave's wife, Casey.  Patrice ultimately declined sex with Dr. Z.  The segment was filled with crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive language, and featured appearances by T.J. Miller and his mother.

The show culminated in a challenge to get someone to use a strap-on dildo.  Opie, Anthony, Patrice, and Eastside Dave discussed scenarios, including Dave using a dildo held by Dr. Z (who was on the phone and mentioned her presence on Squirt.com and Drzeonscoring.com). The conversation was highly sexually explicit and vulgar, focusing on anal sex, fellatio, and penis size.  Dave performed the act on himself, leading to graphic descriptions.  The segment included banter about willingness to participate in sexual acts, jokes about race and body image, and participation from Casey (on the phone).  The show concluded with promotional plugs for websites and other radio shows (including Ron and Fez) before abruptly ending.  Lily and Chuck Nice were briefly mentioned.

[00:29:00]  them girls you have to make them understand that they should be thankful every day every day for  anything you give them you you you he was telling me numbers of what he did and basically it's like  okay relative if it was my money if i gave my girl 500 bucks uh you know every month just because  she's my girl the money he was saying it relative to his it ridiculous amounts of money that he was 
[00:29:30]  just just because he gives it right and she didn't appreciate nothing he just got a huge raise let's  just put it that way well huge raise he he i could say that appreciate nothing opie nothing i don't  know just like my girl don't appreciate nothing like i told you when i write her checks if she  needs a little something when she comes in she goes i need a i need a little extra okay just because  just so she knows i always put in a memo something very uncomfortable so that the teller sees it 
[00:30:00]  something uncomfortable like for being a rotten hoe in a memo you actually write that so the teller  rotten hoe and just because so she understands that it doesn't come without a cost don't ever feel  that comfortable with me yeah where you just go give me money right just give me a couple of dollars  if i give her money i'll throw it on the floor you're always telling her who's just who's boss not  even who's boss but just like where her place is because she knows i'm trying to get rid of her  instinctively i'm trying to get rid of her because i want 50 i want this pajama party thing in my house 
[00:30:30]  right i bought a new house no other women's ever been in there you know what i mean and and she  has a key to my home and and she thinks like why do you always hold that over my head you have a key  to my house and i got a i got a regular one door house when you walk in you open it and it hits a  fake flower i have a fake a plastic white trash on the side to fill up space you can hear it and then 
[00:31:00]  the plant the one of the the leaves sticks through the door so when you close it there's some there's  some plastic tree very white trash uh anthony gave a key to his ex who had a key to to the double door  dynasty door with the bell that go boom boom boom boom boom boom boom with the gargoyle knock  and fist the big knocker on there you understand and she's giving him problems you got a key to the

[00:34:00]  who would you be you would be the girlfriend of not job  what does that make you you are the girlfriend of king kong of radio  king kong you just you just living a life where where a giant white man comes through the woods  picks you up and to go king kong's girlfriend that's who you were god damn that's who you were 
[00:34:30]  hilarious and you causing him typical nonsense typical what are we doing what are we gonna be  where are we going where are you going how about up my my staircase from gone with the wind  you choose which way to go should i go upstairs to the right or to the left  with my i haven't gone upstairs to the left in a while with my my extra staircase right that's what  are you are you are you out your mind we were sitting in that in that big uh that big irish pub 
[00:35:00]  and i was like anthony is your house as big as this place if you put walls certainly he's like  yeah i couldn't see to the end i had to get up and walk to where the the wall was in this place  to see anthony lives in a giant pub house big pub house and you gave problems good luck to you  well our new idea we're going to try to you know turn anthony's house into a sorority house 
[00:35:30]  now it's a sorority house what happened you got to come up with like sorority letters and stuff  first i thought it was going to be a and you got to come up with some home for wayward coke whores  yeah and then i was going to have one half of it was going to be wayward coke whores and the other  half is going to be where i stay with my valuables yeah and i was going to put an electric fence  and collars on them so if they cross over that line they get a little shock but then you could kind of  you know feed them a little uh coke just having fun aren't you let's turn it all into radio 
[00:36:00]  let's do something real yeah let's do something real swing party swing party swing party oh that's  that's that's that's normal but my my hot teen hot pajama party is a bad idea are you kidding me  coke whore well swing party is not more accessible maybe viable maybe the house thing turned into  the teen yeah because because maybe the house pajama party for you know coke whores is maybe a  little crazy now sorority hot teen hot pajama party i'm telling it could work potential for a rape 
[00:36:30]  beef man yeah too much potential so you want him to have a swing party at his house it's no potential  for beef you're going to have respectful adults there there's going to be some single girls getting  free couples pay seventy dollars make a couple of bucks oh you've limited like charge admission  yeah make a couple of my neighbors see a bunch of cars what are you a risky business swing party  anyway they hate you anyway they well i hate you oh he doesn't care about yeah that's what i'm saying  let's have that you're gonna have respectful if you have a pajama party you're not trying to block 
[00:37:00]  c block but i'm saying kind of are 19 and 18 year old girls do you understand 19 they don't know how  to deal with what a 59 year old man 59 how did i go from oh my god in mid 50s i still have a lot of  decent years in my 40s left my friend they may disintegrate when the evil that hits them from  where they think they're a little 18 19 year old evil like yeah we got fun and i'm gonna put out  to when they cross that boundary and feel the seriousness that's about to hit them 
[00:37:30]  they're not gonna be able to deal with it no you need at least 30 years old yeah at least 30 that's  me but 18 and 19 i think it's just too young man yeah meaning too young to really have that i'm down  with the party all right you are down with the party i'm down with the party but the 18 and 19 might  not be maybe if you invite us maybe we shouldn't tell you about our prom contest then oh jeez  what is the matter oh it just turned into and believe me patrice i'm gonna defend myself here 
[00:38:00]  i had no say in any of this what are you talking about they have just between opie and jimmy  they have just gone off and told me what i will be doing well we're excited this is a good time for  they're using my situation and my house to try to make a good radio we're just trying to take care  i don't think obie believes what what happened i think you know that he and here's what i'm trying  to save him from right is getting back the next girlfriend i think anthony has some habits that's 
[00:38:30]  going to get him another girlfriend vote mccain vote mccain what's the matter oh that's my safe word  oh my safe sentence i don't want him to just pick up another chick what's that i don't want you to just  pick another girl up yeah i don't want i don't want just another girl that just lotteries you  really lucks up and scratches the the cumia ticket  and that ticket just went into the shredder 
[00:39:00]  i love the fact that that ticket went into the shredder yeah now i know that it's not blown in  the wind because i said the lottery ticket there's a difference between once you realize that that  ticket's in the shredder or the hope that you see it blown in the wind it's like one of those  cartoons where it's like the lottery ticket blows in the wind and now it's like some race 
[00:39:30]  the chase is on it blew to the top of empire state building let's go to the  he's up in the elevator so listen to our prom idea and tell us what's wrong with this i'm anthony  cumia and i approve this message will you go to prom with me hey it's opie from the opian anthony  show by now you probably know that anthony is single anthony cumia bona fide celebrity he broke  up with his girl right around prom seat so far so good you can shake your booty down on the dog 
[00:40:00]  i think anthony wants to go to a prom and if you're lucky after the prom anthony will give you  something that rhymes with doc bring anthony to your prom 866-FU-LINE-1 866-FU-LINE-1 you can be  anthony's prom date anthony wants to go to a prom call now 866-FU-LINE-1 to have the prom night  of your life see very tame yeah but with this thing the girl the girl has to put out that's  all we ask what's wrong see that age right away yeah it doesn't you know 18 is it yeah there's 
[00:40:30]  18 year olds already 18 year olds that are seniors see this whole thing also that's another possibility  they have a prerequisite that the girls got to uh put out which is an amazing term to use in this  dang an agent and you'll find them but but uh we've had a couple i don't call it already i don't  think it'll wash i really don't think i want to go to a prom uh with some uh uh high school girl 
[00:41:00]  i don't think i don't do that yeah yeah yeah suit yeah i'll be the uh well she has to give up  some novelty date well she has to give up the uh the back door  see we toned it down a little bit i am i am into this okay good but i'm into it for real  i want it to happen yeah this is a very good opportunity for anthony to kind of what find  himself what what are you what are you trying to say you don't want him to go down the same road 
[00:41:30]  again you want him to just i just want i'm gonna maybe try to take a different path this time or  patrice is schooling yeah i just want to make sure you don't you don't repeat anything all right  let's go to cara she's in connecticut he's schooling me a lot of people want to get in on this today  cara yeah hi hi this is patrice um i think he's missing something about the ex anthony's ex-girlfriend  i think the problem is anthony's girlfriend actually liked him he could get a girl that sucked it up  you know and and takes all the benefits but she actually wanted to be with him and the next 
[00:42:00]  why does that make her special though it doesn't make her special what is your point like what is  your point oh no my point is that i don't think she was flawed in any way she just wanted to be  with him because she liked it really so what happened to the relationship she's gone just kind  of slowly uh it was kind of like an iceberg just kind of like going away from land yeah but that's  anthony they were attached there for a while i saw it there was some real uh admiration there on  both sides but it's anthony there was definitely something that was real there for a while it's your 
[00:42:30]  fault it is that's why i want you to make sure you you you make sure that she understood oh it's  my fault because i didn't do the the training and the the general yeah and the private yes all right  we gotta take another break uh listen another break obviously we'll be talking more about anthony's  uh situation well of course but we also have um people that are offended by the crispy freaking  chicken billboard that's ridiculous we got a dj in trouble out on long island that we're gonna 
[00:43:00]  definitely defend sure he did something so bad it's so heinous stupid wbli uh bli out there on  long island just like woman or chinese which one did he uh i think he's uh yeah usually i don't know  i think he might be hispatic or something no no no what did he yeah who did he offend i made fun of  the white trash oh wow we'll get into it after the break they have a group also we got an angry goose  attacking neighbors we got japanese people impersonating springsteen joel are we allowed to do this on this  show i don't know diana ross did we check with the guys some reason we can't make fun of asians

[00:47:30]  little groups all over the place uh ruin this fine business that that i grew up loving uh loving radio  just doesn't fail don't love it as much because they're not doing the right thing these radio  stations uh i don't know this show i know the radio station from my time on um long island working  at bab they uh suspended uh a guy that works for the morning show i guess at wbli  now you're thinking as soon as you hear another dj got suspended okay what another like you're 
[00:48:00]  thinking imus you're thinking some outrageous even though we didn't think it was outrageous some  comment like imus made right yep this is how crazy it's getting a radio dj for a top-rated local  morning show was suspended yesterday after refusing to apologize for making nasty comments about  anyone anyone what did this guy say asians yeah there you go you would go with the group right  no he asian black gay uh he made nasty comments about mastic residents on the air the program's 
[00:48:30]  host said and in mistake beach uh mastic oh i thought you said mistake beach did i say that  no okay that's what people call mastic oh they call it mistake mistake mastic is a hellhole  everyone knows it's a hellhole on long island oh mastic is a like a like a bad part of long island  it's white trashy it's uh it's uh it's not the greatest homes it's not the greatest homes there's  there's some probably some nice homes in the area really but for the most part it's it's it's not a  place you would be you know i just like to call it long island yeah it's just all the same long 
[00:49:00]  island i just call it long how bad is mastic it's a dump all right it's a dump i i used to uh let me  tell you a little something back when i was a little tater tot could barely walk at that age  my parents used to take me and uh joe and dawn to cop out to mastic out to mastic to the bungalow  this was a uh a little house with a pool in the back and i got films of this stuff from uh my father 
[00:49:30]  used to take uh film everywhere eight millimeter film so i got that on video now and it's all these  adults or you know they were in their 20s i guess at the time but uh just getting hammered and uh  partying in mastic a bunch of uh you know white italian uh uh families okay good and then um years  later uh i guess i decided i wonder where that bungalow is let me check that out and see what the hell 
[00:50:00]  that's all about so i drove there and i'm like whoa this neighborhood changed and uh went to the  place and it was all boarded up and the pool was ripped apart and full of garbage and and lumber  it was awful that's very sad but but that is kind of what happened white people did this to the place  this is all white people uh uh yeah i think i'm not sure of the demographic of mastic perhaps we could  pull up a census sheet i think i think it's more white trash than anything anthony is that area 
[00:50:30]  right white trash more than anything i can stand back so iraq what do you got hold on hold on what  do you got go ahead people who live in the woods that you never see except at night they just come  out of the woods how do you know this i've been there zombies you're trying to say this  zombies living in mastic in the woods and when they come out of the woods it's outrageous you're  suspended you can't say there's zombies living in mastic well this is the federation of zombie 
[00:51:00]  americans we're gonna fire off a letter to our boss they're all tweakers you know yeah really uh  crystal meth they love their crystal meth well here's the deal we don't really like radio guys but  we like radio so we we defend pretty much everyone that's getting in trouble at this point yeah someone  has to stand up and yell and scream for this crap of course so on wednesday randy a co-host on the  wbli in the morning on wbli ask to call it from mastic ready for this so there's your setup about  this fine town and let me just give this stat really quickly uh 77.7 percent white in mastic so 
[00:51:30]  you are talking i gather what is known as white trash and then you got uh probably i would say indian  probably um the long island indian is two percent uh you got 264 american indians you got uh 183 asians  you got zero native hawaiians uh 12 percent hispanic and 77 percent white so it's pretty much  hispanic him three quarters white one quarter hispanic oh my god 
[00:52:00]  a bunch of scruffy scuzz bags  it's a supermodel hotbed though they're recruiting as we speak oh if they breed future models always  looks good now this guy uh randy on this morning show a caller from mastic calls in and this is all  randy said and he gets suspended for it uh did your pipes freeze under the trailer or do you have that  stuff down there to keep them warm the caller who was entering a contest said she lived in a house and 
[00:52:30]  was very angry with him in which randy replied just think if you win this game the whole trailer park  will be excited that's a guy all right trying to entertain his audience making a joke mastic is kind of  known and the pd that this this this this this lame pd that has no balls spineless should have said  exactly that that this guy is just trying to entertain his audience and he's trying to make people laugh  yeah oh no station managers asked randy to apologize on yesterday's show but he never did 
[00:53:00]  which i applaud i applaud randy for not apologizing who is that uh huh jesus genuinely in his mind he  doesn't believe he did anything wrong uh randy did not return an email message yesterday station  manager john shea whoop did not return calls for comments uh last night bli is owned by blah blah  blah message left at their office blah blah blah at this point a hollow apology and a mere suspension  will not be appropriate said william floyd school district board president bob uh vecchio who called 
[00:53:30]  for randy to be fired fired for that comment for that comment what's wrong with that go away bob  what did he say and for area residents to boycott the station and its advertisers well we agree with  that you should be listening to the opian anthony show of course uh you can't get a free pass when you  attack an entire community you can't get a free pass when you attack an entire community uh yes you can  shut up bob vecchio an entire community drive through there take a look see if he was accurate 
[00:54:00]  well i you know the the station the radio station you got to stick up for your guys man simple as  that you're how you're allowing these dumb little pockets of special interest groups to  completely ruin to run your station what used to be a great business a great business they're running  your station can you believe that suspend them over that community a lousy trailer park joke you're 
[00:54:30]  allowed to you can't offend an entire community yes yes you can where can you go to offend people now  because yeah where's their place i want to go there's want to go to the offend place internet they  can't control that yet no yeah i see 25 years before they can actually get a hold of figure that out  where they can say no you're not allowed to say that you get in trouble well you got to get the  whole world to agree so i think the internet is safe for a very long time because they have to stop  pouring first before they can stop you know just do so that's the uh mean income of uh some uh of 
[00:55:00]  mastic fourteen dollars a week fourteen dollars a week i don't know how much do wheels for the  trailer yeah what are the wheels for they pull them off so people can just drive away with their house  they always pull the wheels off of those things i'm horrid part of long island a hundred dollars  look i'm from that place i'm from long island long island what's the thing that breaks down the  most that's who makes the most money cars yeah yeah auto auto uh repair places so so like a joey

[00:58:00]  manager didn't stick up for his guy what a what a wimp you're offending an entire community opie who  gives a crap but i i do understand you know what djs are making fun of mutton town anthony  there might be some truth to this if they're making white trash jokes mutton town but you know  what sir i would say that uh i think white people are diligent in making sure that they're not  uh seen to be uh problems like the problems that usually they they they acquit equate to blacks or  yeah the black community right whoever i'm very happy to hear there's there's a scummy town 
[00:58:30]  full of white people can't stop abducting each other can't stop smoking crack i enjoy this i'm  gonna take a visit i'd be there with a news camera every night i do have something to plug patrice o'neal  will be going to mastic after the show and just visiting just checking it out visiting all your  your bulletproof chinese restaurants yeah let's go to anthony anthony and mastic what's up anthony  how's it going guys um mastic is full of a bunch of white people that want to be gangsters 
[00:59:00]  they think they're gangsters they're full of they're just full of themselves and mastic is just a rotting  cesspool yeah i don't know anything about this show but i i would strongly suggest our listeners  call up wbli on long island and and say you're from mastic and that you could take a joke and you  really should stick up for your guys and it's not a joke it was the truth right you really should stick  up for your guys and protect your guys because all they're trying to do is entertain and make people 
[00:59:30]  laugh on the way to work simple as that enough is enough don't let these dumb little special interest  groups ruin radio god enough why does anybody want to listen to that crap well i don't know  whatever if it's a bad station it's a bad station that's not the point i'm trying to make here  yeah you know you gotta you gotta stick up for these uh djs that are getting in trouble because  they're ruining it for everybody these wimpy station managers that can't you know uh stick up for  their boys yeah but the people that just cry over everything and they you know here's some stupid

[01:11:30]  it makes me sick poor white people have a voice uh someone stole my car tire in mastic should we go  on uh i have a summer house in mastic for some reason why would you summer in mastic yeah  nick what's wrong with you nick yeah i had uh my grandparents had a summer house there yeah and  uh they robbed it once yeah they took the liquor and just the ice trays out of the freezer that's 
[01:12:00]  how trailer park it is there you go what you inherit some money from a great aunt  just your share of your great aunt's fortune we're summering in mastic wow  mastic is the embarrassment of long island i used to summer uh in waiting river which is  now is that the worst part huh is mastic the worst part of long island oh wow wine dance is a lot of  fun wine dance uh parts of hempstead are are no treat yeah yeah brentwood mastic is not even the 
[01:12:30]  worst part of long island well that's the worst white person part wine dance is uh probably the  worst black person part yeah there's a black part of long island oh yeah roosevelt roosevelt  yeah yeah it's in the top 10 it's in the top 10 yeah when i used to drive to bab i would take  the back roads through wine dance and one day i had a i had a 20 minute delay on just the regular  road because there was a huge gang shooting happening they were like their two gangs were just  going at it i don't know 100 200 yards ahead of my car i'm watching yeah fire and all sorts of 
[01:13:00]  crap go down a lot of people think long island is just long island it's broken up into a lot of  little places that have their very own unique personalities that's for sure this is interesting  i'm gonna do some studying about people think long island is you know a lighthouse and it's not even  a borough right long island's not a borough no no two counties yeah nasa and suffolk all right we're  late for a break but uh there you go so uh you know we uh we stick up for this guy randy whoever he  is from uh this morning show out there in long island john shea you're a douche you should be fired 
[01:13:30]  you have no business being a station manager and bob vecchio you should spend your time maybe uh  cleaning up your your community and not worried about dumb uh dj's worry about dj's that's what  randy looks like and we just defended him all right look all right look we don't care if he gets fired  now wow okay i'm calling for his firing is he in a is he in a kitty pool of oatmeal maybe we shouldn't  be uh defending this guy he's wacky oh this has nothing to do with the fact that he's uh he's like 
[01:14:00]  porno he looks like he's a flamer and he does a very uh and he does very hacky bits but you know  what but i still defend him you gotta you should fire him in general but not for yeah yeah you should  just fire him for for who he is for being a hack there's a picture on the website where he's in a  pink outfit we just we just defended a guy that's uh in a pink outfit on their website that looks  like bizarro anthony yeah the phones are lit all they want to do is talk about how bad this place is 
[01:14:30]  and this guy bob vecchio is trying to get a dj fired oh i am fired up man fired up we got patrice  on the studio we got uh we got an angry goose on the loose we got uh yeah black history month sure  you want to play the latest the last one this is the last the last one the last year original one  but i want to play a couple of my favorites from the month though sure we might as well look back 
[01:15:00]  but here's today's honoree for black history month in honor of black history month the opie and anthony  show is honoring black heroes african-american individuals throughout history without whom this  country would not be the melting pot it is today today we honor american explorer matthew alexander  who in 1909 became the first black man to ever reach the north pole oh it's cold up here  matthew alexander henson exploring the world and our hearts stay tuned for more icons of black history 
[01:15:30]  on the opie and anthony show  good morning to everybody another busy one we got patrice o'neill we're fighting battles all over  the place oh it's something going on in here oh yeah the pest um by the way they did a great job  with that douche in cleveland oh my god to the point where the guy uh had a call in sick even though he 
[01:16:00]  wasn't sick talking about maxwell he took some shots at us for for what reason we don't even know  so uh yeah we're slapping him around a little bit having a little fun with him and the reason because  he questioned this is just because we enjoy doing that we're we're not scared of a radio show in  cleveland whatsoever so the pest uh they just did a full-out attack and i guess they had a webcam in  studio i was being told i was being debriefed yesterday yeah that's what i read and one of uh maxwell's  show members was just sitting there the entire time as maxwell was uh getting a talking to in the 
[01:16:30]  program director's office and then all of a sudden he was sick and didn't do his show yesterday way to  fight the battle nice one way to fight the battle as a brave guy yeah so cool we got that going on  and we're talking about uh what happened to this uh radio guy out there on long island and uh we thought  we were gonna have an interview here but now i'm not really sure what's going on do we know  thumbs up one minute okay we're gonna be talking to uh bob vecchio oh if you haven't heard yet uh 
[01:17:00]  there's this uh dj some guy i don't know what's his name uh randy randy who got in trouble out there  on uh long island uh did you hear about this anthony yeah i think i did uh and uh he got suspended  because uh he has to call it from mastic which is a which is a lovely neighborhood uh out there on  long island um he has to call it from mastic uh did your pipes freeze under the trailer or do you 
[01:17:30]  have that stuff down there to keep them warm implying that everybody uh is in a trailer yes  the caller who was entering a contest said she lived in a house and was very angry with him  to which randy replied i can't believe that someone would actually say this this is insane yeah he says uh  just think if you win this game the whole trailer park will be excited that's going a little too far  in my book i'm thinking well it is it's it's just implying that uh everybody lives in a trailer there  and conjures up an image of uh an impoverished neighborhood yeah station managers asked uh randy 
[01:18:00]  to apologize uh yesterday on his show he never did like what's wrong with this guy just apologize  yeah genuinely in his mind he doesn't believe he did anything wrong oh really you didn't do anything  wrong just attacking a whole community like that yeah a hard-working community at that  randy did not return uh an email uh message yesterday uh he's hiding out that's that's brave  uh station manager john shea did not return calls for comment last night i guess he's the guy that uh 
[01:18:30]  was behind the suspension of this randy guy he should be commended because uh absolutely there's  no reason an entire community should be lumped in uh with a few bad apples perhaps right um i'm not too  familiar with mastic right but i'm sure there are hard-working people out there as uh there are in  any community sure and the article goes on to say at this point a hollow apology and a mere suspension  will not be appropriate said william floyd school district board president bob vecchio who called for 
[01:19:00]  randy to be fired and for area residents to boycott the station and its advertisers you can't get a free  pass when you attack an entire community yeah with that we welcome bob vecchio to the greg and tony  show uh mr vecchio hello greg and tony good morning good morning how are you sir uh we're doing fine this  morning yeah i guess your phone is ringing off the hook today huh sir i tell you you know as a school  board president i get a lot of phone calls about a lot of different issues but this one uh has ranked 
[01:19:30]  among the top yeah i bet uh now this uh dj uh went on the air and uh what what kind of reaction did  you get from his comments that led you to uh contact uh the station and uh uh call for his firing  well the the comments were mean spirited and tried to disparage an entire community in one broad stroke  and what was most troubling to me as a school board president is this uh radio station's target  audience is a younger crowd mainly uh high school students and in you know in lumping our community 
[01:20:00]  in saying you know we're all trailer park trash right our community took it that not only was he  attacking our community he was attacking our youth as well well you're not all uh trailer park trash what  percentage would you say is uh trailer park trash well we have no trailer parks whatsoever number one  uh we do have issues of poverty in our community like so many communities across this country but it is a 
[01:20:30]  hard-working community uh we have a great school district it's a beautiful waterfront community we  uh we border yeah i mean you know we have houses on the water we have beaches uh you know did you say  on or in or under it is a waterfront community smith point community beach uh some of the best beach  around oh i love smith point when i'm out there on long island sure yeah and uh you know that's our  community and and we have pockets of uh diversity within our community so what's the problem with 
[01:21:00]  uh this radio show i mean uh master can't take a joke i guess is that uh the message here no believe  me master could take a joke but when you cross a line at your sophomoric attempt at humor right  mean spirited but don't you think people take it as sophomoric uh humor and they shouldn't be offended  and they shouldn't take it seriously and and don't they should realize that it's just a a radio show  trying to entertain people well if you're going to try to entertain people you should try to be an  entertainer and not try to be mean spirited and jerry springer like so what's wrong with jerry springer 
[01:21:30]  we're all about pop uh junk culture these uh days well i and i think that's a lot of the problems with  the culture too everybody loves the train wreck and move on to the next train wreck and they don't  think about the unintended consequences and i think if you're going to try to charge our youth in  that manner we're not going to sit by and let you get a free pass how is he um i'm just curious uh how  how is the youth being disparaged by this uh remark sir well if you're going to call an entire  community trailer park trash you're calling our kids trailer park trash and that's not true and 
[01:22:00]  what we're going to stick up and we're going to defend for what's right and you know we're you know  we could take a joke just as good as anybody else but you know it doesn't really sound like you guys  could take a joke because i i don't think this guy was being mean spirit he was just trying to get a  laugh out there uh well you know obviously he didn't get a laugh so sir let me ask you a quick  question yeah sure what is the can you please get an example i know it's on on the spot but can you  please get an example of an acceptable mastic joke that i could make about mastic and not get in  trouble just so i know so so i wouldn't get in trouble well i don't think today there would be 
[01:22:30]  an acceptable mastic joke no i mean given the circumstances of what had happened in our community  we had three kids that were attempted to be abducted and sexually assaulted and this only goes back a  couple of weeks ago so yes in mastic right so it's not so you're basically saying yourself it's  really not a safe place so you're just saying don't joke about the fact that your town stinks  no that's not what i'm saying no and you know obviously you guys are following along the same  lines and that's fine our our community well i i was brought up on long island and i think everyone 
[01:23:00]  knows that mastic is not the safest place on long island it's right up there is one of the worst  uh towns on long island i'm from huntington okay and the northward area and uh what yeah you come  from a safe community as well and again right so so i don't think this guy was far-fetched by making  a little joke everyone knows that mastic has its problems sure well you know and you guys got a long  way to go before people feel safe in that in that community well listen if he didn't cross the line 
[01:23:30]  why would his management spend them because his manager is a wimp i think there's a completely honest  with you yeah there's this whole uh atmosphere of fear that's going on with the media these days  that if anybody complains about something that somebody's doing especially in humor uh that they  have to instantly suspend the um personality or else there's going to be these huge repercussions which  i don't understand what you know what you guys might not understand it and we just reacted to a 
[01:24:00]  comment that we fell across the line and you still think their own decision you still think this  gentleman uh should be fired absolutely because if you listen to his program you're insane bob  well let me hear let me hear why let me hear why why should he be fired program content on a regular  basis have you uh no actually i haven't i okay well you know what this is what we're gonna do we're  gonna we're gonna uh contact but shouldn't you shouldn't you be shouldn't you be uh controlling the  school but like your expertise is school but when did your expertise become funny like why are you 
[01:24:30]  in funny business no what i am i'm an advocate for our community okay but what if i start saying  that the way you teach kids at the school is not appropriate like you're getting into something  that's not even up your alley just teach math well listen number one is a school board president i'm  not a teacher so if you knew anything about but see you're not even see you're one of these guys  you argue this called context you just made uh you just made our point wait you just made our point 
[01:25:00]  we don't know about what you do but you certainly don't know what funny is so patrice made a perfect  point there bob your community needs a lot of help yeah i don't the last thing you need to do is go  after dopey djs well no we're taking one issue at a time and you know what we're not going to let  the media take a free pass at our community mastic stinks i think you could certainly say that sir  but i don't say it 47 000 other people say i don't know i don't know if we're allowed to say  mastic stinks because bob vecchio is uh you know he's making sure that uh the mastic is protected 
[01:25:30]  as all hell i've heard of mastic in the last hour since i've been sitting here and all i know is  that it stinks there's not one thing that anyone said that boy mastic is great a guy selling his  house for 50 bob we read uh the story on our show and then the phones lit up not one guy defending  mastic we had phone call after phone call after phone call about how how horrific this place still is  and i i'm not one guy that's advocating in time well there you go bravo so so you'll shut down a 
[01:26:00]  radio show one guy i'm not shutting down a radio show that's what bli is doing no see because the  because they're wimps because they they take what you guys have to say seriously well it's about time  somebody no i don't think so bob i don't think it's about time take a joke and then take care of  it's about time what it's about time unfunny people keep getting their big noses into funniness  just stay out of this stay out of funny try to be funny i think i think there's a a freedom of 
[01:26:30]  speech issue here you know there's a freedom of speech issue and that's why i have the right to say  what i want exactly well you do but you're you know trying to get a guy's livelihood taken away is  not freedom of speech that's um that's what they call private sector and we have no control over  it's it's it's it's on the same lines of uh mob tactics hey bob i'll tell you the truth  i have a bigger problem with wb a b uh wbli's management for for for wimping out  to your complaint you know what you have every right to complain but what my my my biggest thought 
[01:27:00]  today is that station management should pretty much hang up on you and go shut up don't tell me  how to run my radio station and i won't tell you how to run your town thank you and now they gave  this guy power you think he's done now oh he he has a little taste of of making confusion now he's  going to be calling everywhere trying to get the mastic jokes taken out of get get out of here  well you just stop stop it just just be happy with the power you got you're a warden listen i have no 
[01:27:30]  power i i you do i can smell it on your voice now you're pretty happy today your name's in the paper  and you and you you you got people talking about your town you know i looked at a map of mastic and  and it looks like a christmas tree there's so many different colors of sexual prayers and  in your in your community how can you take this town serious when my name is in news day  i could tell you that right no he's not happy you're not happy stop it i've dealt with news day  i can i can see bob what do you what do you find funny i can tell you what does bob vecchio find 
[01:28:00]  he put on makeup for this radio interview you can hear what do you find funny bob i find a lot of  things funny i i name one thing specific but i you know i i find george carlin very funny  but i don't find him funny on public airwaves i i will go to see a show of his i will watch him  on hbo right watch the show in front of my kids well you do you do realize that this morning show  they followed fcc regulations right well yeah i'm sure they do and it was pretty damn tame 
[01:28:30]  well of course it's tame i mean you know it's tame in comparison to howard stern it's tame in  comparison to a lot of other shows on you know opie and anthony but you know what if people react a  certain way and the management takes it to a level that's the management's problem we are just  advocating for what we felt crossed the line and if we felt it crossed the line and the management  are a bunch of whips get them on your radio show and ask them why they're oh we're gonna try it we  would bob this is what you need to do say all right we made our point and and we don't want  the guy actually fired that's not my decision well yeah you it says in the paper it says you're 
[01:29:00]  calling for randy to be fired and for area residents to boycott the station and its advertisers  that's bob vecchio's comment and how that works right and that's all right doesn't he know that  his his under his thing is the reason why that the station acted is the fact that you complain is  why the station got the guy right spend it so you're not taking any responsibility for like if you  just mind your business things would go on i'm not taking any responsibility for their actions 
[01:29:30]  not no for your actions of being a tattletale like you're being a tattletale a tattletale yeah you're  not even being like a dude well one don't do that one guy called one guy called your office and you  decided to make a big stink dude i bet you got one complaint about this and you decided to make a big  stink one phone call to bob vecchio's office and let me ask you a question i don't think that would  you snitch on your best friend if you cheated on his wife excuse me would you snitch on your best  friend if he cheated on his wife if he cheated on his wife would you snitch on my best friend yeah 
[01:30:00]  i compare it to this situation no i'm asking you i'm asking you it's a it's a character yeah come on  stop trying to disco dance mr no context just ask the question if a man cheated on his wife if your  best friend don't try to I'm not in your school system don't try to word me up if your best friend  Your buddy cheated on his wife.  Would you snitch on him?  Would I snitch on him?  You heard me.  I don't know.  I've never been in that situation.  Oh, there you go.  You're not being real.  How can you take anything seriously when you're not even asking a dude question? 
[01:30:30]  Bob, let's go right to the source.  He won't do it.  What's up with the people that live in the woods in Mastic?  What's up with the people that live in the woods?  He keeps repeating the question.  Yeah.  We've had many people call in from Mastic saying that there's people that actually live in the woods.  I haven't run into them.  And we have very little woods out here, too.  I'd like to know, where do you guys rank the school district in the United States as far as educating the students? 
[01:31:00]  In the United States, we actually do pretty well.  We're about average to slightly below average in New York State.  But New York State ranks among the top tier in the United States with education.  Okay.  We'll check that out.  Mastic has bizarro everybodies.  Oh, Steve.  I think a lot of areas have bizarro everybodies.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Did you see?  You look a lot like a guy we actually like that's in studio today.  And there should be that, like, this...  He probably has a face for radio, too.  I think...  Oh, I heard that one. 
[01:31:30]  I think they're, um...  I'm funny.  I think...  No, we was laughing at the fact you tried to attempt to be funny.  We didn't even think you had that in here.  Look, you know what?  You just made fun of ugly people.  Maybe we should start calling Newsday.  Bob Vecchio makes fun of ugly people.  That's right.  He should step down from his job.  See how this works, Bob?  How ridiculous it is?  Yeah, that's fine.  Call the school district and have him fire me.  That's fine.  That's fine with Bob.  I don't care.  We probably would do him a favor, and then he gets to go to a real nice community.  He wants in a better school district. 
[01:32:00]  You know it.  He's just working his way up.  It's obvious.  Even Bob Vecchio wants out of Mass.  You want Smithtown, don't you?  Trying to look unassuming with his goatee.  Yeah, he...  I'm sorry.  Fine, right?  He wants out.  So I guess if there's potential employers out there, they should call your office, right,  immediately.  We'll get you out of there, Bob.  No problem.  We'll get you out of there.  I'm very content where I am.  Okay.  Let me see.  I just want to see if you have a sense of humor.  Oh, I always have fun.  Just follow along.  Okay.  Knock, knock. 
[01:32:30]  Knock, knock.  What are you doing?  No, you know how knock, knock jokes go.  Okay, who's there?  Mastic.  Great place.  Good for you.  No, no.  Now, Bob, you know how this works.  Knock, knock.  Go along with the joke.  Mastic who?  Mastic my...  in that unsuspecting girl walking through the woods.  Well, it's a good thing you guys are on satellite radio.  I'm sure you're listening to shipping by 10 with that. 
[01:33:00]  That was pretty sarcastic.  Yeah, that really was.  Deep down, you're not this robotic mess you're pretending to be.  Why don't you just stop?  Just be a dude.  I'm a dude.  I have a feeling that Bob is a raging alcoholic on the weekend.  Say that like it's a bad thing.  Chasing every skirt that doesn't live in Mastic.  He just doesn't want people to know why people actually have these crackhead kind of like traditional black and Puerto Rican what's seen to be their problem. 
[01:33:30]  A lot of white people are terrible at that.  You do understand a lot of people on Long Island do comment on Mastic a lot in a negative way, don't you, Bob?  Absolutely, I do.  Yeah, and don't you think fixing that is probably a little more important than somebody maybe being offended by a trailer park joke?  Well, I think it's all one and the same.  I don't think so.  Bob, I think going to the sex offender page and seeing pin marks on there. 
[01:34:00]  It was a rainbow, Bob.  It was a rainbow of colors in Mastic.  I think that's a little more important than...  And that's why we've called for the Department of Social Services, Janet DeMarzo, to be fired as well.  All right, there you go.  That's more important than a dumb DJ.  Hey, Bob, do us all a favor.  Build a huge fence around Mastic so none of these people are able to leave.  And no one can inadvertently drive in.  I'll contract with the U.S. government to get some stuff.  All right, see.  Good luck with you on this X-Files episode called Mastic.  Bob, yeah, good news, you're being transferred out of Mastic. 
[01:34:30]  Bad news, you're going to windanche.  See, he knows.  See, he laughs.  I kind of like Bob now because he's laughing.  He's a sarcastic guy.  I know.  He's being just a...  He is.  I'm also a very shallow guy.  That's why I'm still on the air with you guys because I don't care what you think.  That is true.  He's a shallow, sarcastic guy.  Usually it would never last this long.  I will say this much.  You know, most people avoid us and you came right on the air.  And I really do have more of a problem with the management of this dumb radio station for 
[01:35:00]  listening to your dopey...  Your drivel.  Your drivel.  I really do.  They already suspended him before I put that drivel in the Newsday Reporter's ear.  Yeah, it's too bad.  Too bad.  So I have more of a problem with them.  But your comment about how he should be fired, you got to relax, Bob.  You really do.  Well, again, that's not my decision.  There's nothing worse than empowering like a not-fat, not-skinny guy.  Like, you have the worst...  He's just the most annoying shape.  Just a kind of...  Just a... 
[01:35:30]  Just a...  Just shaped like a cup of soda.  Just...  Just not fat.  Just a regular guy.  About 5'8".  Wait, Bob's fighting back.  What, Bob?  I said you guys give me far too much credit for assuming I have that much power.  You do!  No, I don't.  Ask anybody that knows me.  I certainly...  Well, I'm going to be a gnostic today at 3 with torches and everything.  Torches?  Killing all the zombies that run around your town.  I'm coming up with a bunch of N-words and we're going to take care of this goofy town.  We got to get a plan together.  You call me where you're going to be and we could be raging alcoholics somewhere down here. 
[01:36:00]  All right.  We got to get a plan together.  We got to get rid of the zombies first that live in the woods.  And then we'll...  We heard about those.  I don't know what that's about.  We're going to study that.  We're going to study a bunch of your listeners.  Oh, wow.  No, you didn't, Bob.  I didn't.  No, you didn't.  We're always walking around with those XM radios.  Hey, he knows a lot about us.  All right, Bob.  Get lost.  We got a radio show.  All right, Bob.  Go get someone fired.  Yeah.  All right.  Later.  All right.  Peace.  God, I hate that. 
[01:36:30]  Couldn't shake the guy.  I know.  I hate when that happens.  That's right.  You wind up almost kind of liking him.  Dude, you got to like the guy.  I know.  He's a smart ass.  He's a piece of garbage in some like high level job where he has to be a jerk or he has  to be some, hey, you can't do it.  Oh, in his private life, he is a piece of stuff.  Oh, end jokes.  I think end jokes fly out of his mouth.  You know he's a piece of garbage.  You couldn't dislike him because he's an ass.  He knows it.  How can you dislike that guy?  I think he was like biting his lip because he just wants to say, I completely agree with 
[01:37:00]  you.  Oh, God.  No.  Get me out of this hell.  He wasn't even that high.  Like, he wasn't that straight.  I have to live here.  You see his fat face and he tried to dress up nice.  You can just see.  You can see the dysfunction in his little beady eyes.  Good Lord.  You know, you know.  He's like a radio guy stuck in some horrific radio market.  Bad market.  Just hoping to be called up to the big lady.  And you know he probably hits on like the single mothers of some of those awful school 
[01:37:30]  children.  Because you know there's a lot of single mothers up there in Mastic.  Probably.  Oh, he takes them out there.  There's probably a lot of those single mothers.  Mitch's Scotchnip.  Listen, I'm going to take you over to.  Scotchnip.  I don't know what I've done.  I'm going to take you to the Cheesecake Factory.  And she goes, oh my God.  I've never been there.  I've never been to the Cheesecake Factory.  Oh, God.  We're going to get out of Mastic for a while.  All right.  We got to break. 
[01:38:00]  Shut up.  All right.  That was our exclusive with Bob Vecchio.  Let's, why don't we, enough about Mastic, but there you go.  Yeah.  Mastic stinks.  Why are we, like, defending radio guys?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Someone has to.  Especially that oatmeal swimming guy in the sky.  God.  I'm calling for his firing.  Yeah.  He's in an oatmeal freaking bath.  Thanks.  I don't want him fired for the Mastic remark.  I want him fired for being in that oatmeal waiting pool. 
[01:38:30]  Just in general.  Oh, God.  All right.  Black History Month is pretty much over.  I want to play one of my favorites from the month as we go to break with Patrice O'Neal.  I reject this, by the way.  Yeah.  No, you don't.  And I'm going to complain.  Call Vecchio.  Have us fired.  Be careful.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes,  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot it is today.  Today, we honor Samuel L. Jackson and Halle Berry for their poignant roles in the racially charged 1991 Spike Lee joint, Jungle Fever. 
[01:39:00]  Yo, there.  Would you let two loving brothers get a moment alone to get reacquainted?  You know what I'm saying?  Where the f*** am I supposed to go?  I don't know where the f*** I am.  Where you go?  Can't you skin an ass?  I'll f*** you.  I'll get a motherf***er swing away from it.  I'll swing, motherf***er.  I'm trying to get the f***ing money.  Never has such raw f***ing emotion been captured in one f***ing scene. 
[01:39:30]  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton, who's up there in Cleveland.  Hey, Jimmy.  Oh, by the way, the attack on Maxwell's radio show has just begun. 
[01:40:00]  The pest will continue with that thing.  He's got to go back to work sometime.  Yeah, he actually had to take a sick day yesterday because he couldn't handle the pest.  He'll spin it some other way, I'm sure, but he knows the truth.  Yeah, yeah.  I think management took him off the air yesterday just to try to calm this whole thing down.  Yeah, it's not going to calm it down.  It just makes these pests angrier.  The maniacs.  Anthony's flying up to Cleveland right after the show today. 
[01:40:30]  We'll be joining Jimmy at the House of Blues tonight for two sold-out shows.  Yes.  Patrice O'Neill not promoting anything this time around.  Man, what?  I have nothing.  Are you promoting your pimp suits?  You should have a clothing line with your pimp suits.  I don't have a clothing line.  I'm just now dressing as a decent human being.  You really are.  You came in so sharp this morning.  Incredibly sharp.  His outfit, he's got the pimp hat.  I don't know what those hats are called.  Stop. 
[01:41:00]  Why do white people say the word pimp with such disgust?  And it doesn't mean I'm pimps.  I don't mind a pimp.  Pimp, just say.  I don't mind that.  It's an attitude.  I don't have any women that are selling for China anywhere.  Tell me what kind of hat that is.  Tell me what kind of hat that is, then.  It's a beaver fur hat.  It's 50X fur.  It's like a cotton club type of hat, right?  Yes.  It's just a little...  Well, where are you?  It's a little smooth.  Beaver fur.  Beaver fur.  Okay.  Your shirt's got gold buttons on it.  And then you've got really nice alligator shoes. 
[01:41:30]  Size 15, I learned.  Because my girl is getting a little too comfortable.  So I have to just twinkle a little bit.  You're twinkling just to keep her in her place?  I just have to walk...  Hello, my baby.  Hello, my honey.  Hello, my ragtime gal.  And then your pants look like pajama pants.  But they're not.  I said they look like...  Don't call them pajama pants.  I just got a way of just taking a look and crapping on it.  No, I'm going somewhere with this.  Patrice walked in.  And then you had the full-length, beautiful black coat.  It's called a frock coat. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, man.  Was that nice?  It's from the Old West.  Old West frock coat.  Patrice walked in.  And I go, are you playing for the San Diego Conquista Doors?  I gave you an ABA joke.  Dude.  You look like...  You know, semi-pro's big.  I just want to...  Opening up in theaters today.  So I made an ABA joke with you.  I just want to twinkle a little bit.  Yeah.  A little twinkle.  I like...  Do you want to put out there?  Why, why?  I like that he say...  He say...  I don't...  I do not mind a pimp.  I don't mind a pimp or two.  There's nothing more white to say. 
[01:42:30]  Sure.  Yeah.  I do not mind a pimp.  No.  Why would one mind a pimp?  No.  I accept the pimp.  Because white people have problems with context.  No, Patrice.  Pimps aren't all...  When you say pimp, people think you're going to put somebody on the street.  Right.  No.  To sell their thing.  That's what I meant, though.  You were getting so defensive.  I know.  I have to.  When someone uses the word pimp, I enjoy it.  It's fine.  The context of the word pimp has changed over time.  Not really.  You still get in trouble on the news for saying it. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  You don't get the context.  Folks, show.  Folks, show.  Folks, show.  We got T.J. Miller in studio.  That's from The Wire.  That's Omar.  You watch The Wire?  Religiously.  Jimmy, turn me on to The Wire.  I'm obsessed.  Because everybody says...  Folks, show.  It's amazing.  It's the end of the last episode.  Omar is one of the greatest characters ever on TV.  The scary gay gangster.  How do you pull that off?  But he does.  But he's gone, though.  He's a badass as he's deep kissing young gangsters. 
[01:43:30]  Young male gangsters.  Young male gangsters.  He deep kisses them and then he gets his shotgun together and hits the streets and everyone  runs scared.  Did you get the last episode?  Oh, hey.  I'm not going to tell you where I am.  No.  I got a whole big box set thing.  I'm not even...  I'm not even watching this year.  Oh, no.  I'm way behind.  Oh, you...  Oh, you...  Okay.  Boat show.  TJ Miller, what are you promoting?  Our friend from Cloverfield.  Yeah.  I'm promoting...  The Cloverfield buzz has sort of...  Faded.  Faded a little bit. 
[01:44:00]  It was gangbusters for a while.  Oh.  Hey, you're looking at a guy that didn't like your movie, by the way.  Oh.  Good, good.  You and my landlady.  Those are the two people that hated Cloverfield.  I hated Cloverfield with all my...  All my soul.  He was the camera guy.  He was the movie.  He was the movie.  I like you saying that because you're like...  I don't blame him.  He's in a movie.  I mean, look, I would have did it in a minute.  So, I mean, I'm just a person that just watched it and hated it.  But if I...  I don't hate TJ for being in it.  He was the movie. 
[01:44:30]  You were the movie.  But I like that you're like, I hated the movie.  You were the movie.  I don't hate you.  What I hated was you.  It's you.  Pretty much what he's saying.  I like the movie.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Because I just want to make this clear.  I liked the movie.  Jimmy liked the movie.  Patrice did not like the movie to the point when the credits hit.  He went, boo.  I said more than boo.  And then a big time movie reviewer goes, who asked ya?  TJ, I did appreciate your fat head falling down from the monster's mouth with the camera. 
[01:45:00]  Everything you say is like a veiled criticism.  Veiled?  You know what I did appreciate was your fat head falling from the monster.  It's not your fat head, TJ.  The fat head character of just dropping down.  You know, I was the character, right?  You were the character.  And they didn't add any prosthetics to my head.  If the head was fat, it was my head.  You're Eric Scholes from Mask Head just falling out of that monster's mouth, TJ.  I'm playing with you. 
[01:45:30]  TJ had that uncomfortable silence.  I'll tell you what I hate about the movie.  It's as simple as well.  How do you get away with making fun of someone that was in a huge Hollywood movie?  I was trying to say what I didn't like about the movie.  He's got those shoes.  By the way, where the reviews were.  If you have those shoes, you can make fun of anybody in any movie.  You can yell boo.  Chris Rock is right.  What?  I'm burning bridges.  TJ's a comic.  He might know someone.  He's a comedian.  I'll tell you I know it.  Opie and Anthony and J.J. Abrams.  So be very careful. 
[01:46:00]  Very careful, Patrice O'Neal.  It was too much.  What's that word?  Suspension of disbelief.  That bothered me.  I wish.  This is what I wish Cloverfield was.  A regular monster movie.  Okay.  That's all I wanted.  So it was hard for you to suspend the belief of what, though?  What they had to have you do in the movie.  Right.  Like instead of it being third person and we watching all this stuff, what they had to  have you do to tell the story of the movie, like specific places you had to look with 
[01:46:30]  your camera to tell the story.  Oh man, there's the monster, but I'm going to go back over here to make sure I get the  reaction of the guy that's going to get his beautiful girlfriend who's stuck on a pipe  in a building that tipped over to the river.  It just was too...  If it had to have been a regular monster movie, I would have probably loved it.  Yeah.  But the concept was...  And I don't like high concept, but it was too high concept because it just... 
[01:47:00]  I like high concept, but just medium high.  Yeah, high.  Not...  Not what it did, just what they had you do as the camera guy, it just bugged me.  Well, I think a lot of people either love it or you hate it.  Yeah.  It's like you and then my landlady in Los Angeles.  She hated it?  She comes to me.  She goes, TJ, baby, I see your movie.  And I go, oh, great.  What did you think of it?  She goes, it make me sick.  So sick. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, the motion sickness thing, right?  Probably physically, though, like because of the...  Yeah, she said, but she said, you make everyone sick.  Everybody asks for money back.  I was like, everybody.  Everybody did?  Yes.  It made $80 million.  Everybody asks for money back.  That's a lot of money to get back.  Who make decision to make it move so much?  I said, well, the director, but I was the cameraman.  She goes, so you do it?  I was like, well, yeah, kind of.  You make me sick.  And now every time I see her around the building, you make still movie next time. 
[01:48:00]  Okay?  You make me sick.  I wanted that movie.  So I brought the building.  It was better than Godzilla.  It was better than the 2000 remake of Godzilla.  Oh, God damn.  See, that's what I'm saying.  You don't like the way that it's shot, but you want to be a traditional monster movie.  Look what happens with traditional monster movies.  I know.  I hear where you're going.  King Kong?  I hear where you're going.  It's just, I do like my professors that explain to me this giant tuna fish monster.  I do, I tell you, the tick, the body ticks. 
[01:48:30]  That fell off the monster?  Genius.  That really was cool.  Okay, well, we got you with the ticks.  There was things in it.  It just, when you're running down, your incessant, not your, but your character's incessant need  to film as you're running and you have to go back to get a quick thing of the tick.  Right.  It just, it just, boom with the camera.  It was so many good things in it that.  But if he drops the camera, then we don't have a movie.  That's why.  Make the movie.  That's all. 
[01:49:00]  And basically what Patricia's saying, nobody would go save that chick in that situation.  It's just too much.  You would let her die.  You would just let her die.  I'm here and the monster is this.  Good luck, pumpkin push.  All right, let's move on.  77% positive reviews for Cloverfield.  Just has to be said.  Just to play the other side.  Thank you.  Because I like TJ.  I don't want him to feel uncomfortable in our studio.  Why would TJ be uncomfortable?  He's, look.  No, I don't feel uncomfortable.  You know how many bad characters I've done and been with that?  I don't care.  I'm a fan.  The thing that's making me feel most uncomfortable right now is Patrice's shoes and pants. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah, all right.  I'm serious about that.  Oh, jeez.  He's hoping to be drafted by the ABA.  I'm going to go back to the ABA jokes.  TJ's a racist.  He's not a racist.  I'm just saying it.  That's how you start white people in their tracks.  Oh, yeah.  Racist.  Don't stop me.  I appreciate that.  Don't make us stop you in your tracks.  Yeah.  We got the ABA, my friend.  I finished that off with and.  Racist and what else?  And what else, Emma?  Hey, I got something. 
[01:50:00]  Can I say he's the best part of the movie?  Thank you.  TJ was awesome.  TJ, what are you promoting?  Because we're going to go back to Anthony here.  Yeah, absolutely.  Let him sit there for two hours.  Oh, jeez.  I'm at Comics this weekend in Manhattan tonight and tomorrow night shows at 8.30 and 10.45.  Very nice.  People got to come out, man.  And you can use a promo code.  TJM229 is a promo code online to get that.  What's your last name?  Miller.  TJ Miller.  Call yourself the, I am the camera guy.  From Cloverfield.  From Cloverfield.  And you look way smaller. 
[01:50:30]  I'm the fat, I'm the fat head that fell from the monster's mouth from Cloverhead.  That's actually on the billboard at Comics.  Fat head.  At Comics tonight and tomorrow, the fat head that fell from the mouth of the monster.  You know what you should do for your show is you should put a stool on the stage with  a camera and do your whole bit from backstage and then the big screen is just people watching  your comedy because the camera would be technically bad.  I promise, there's less motion sickness in my stand-up. 
[01:51:00]  The reason that the movie Cloverfield, if Cloverfield was real, the reason it exists is performing  at Comics this week.  Right.  TJ is the reason that Cloverfield was real.  There it is.  I got one thing and there wasn't even a negative statement within it.  Comics with an X.  That's the mistake this club is doing.  I've been there a few times.  I like the place a lot.  Beautiful club.  But people can't find it online because they spelled comics with an X to be cute.  Yeah, they did.  But it's comics online, it's comicsny.com with an X. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  All right, hey.  Go for tickets online.  It's going to be great.  I got two amazing Chi-Town kids that are opening for me, Pete Holmes, Kumail.  It's going to be awesome.  Our boy, Anthony, he's now single and we're trying to do the right thing.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find him a prom date.  That's not going so well.  What's the other thing, Anthony?  Is that the age bracket that you're looking into, Anthony?  Yeah.  It is.  Why not?  I mean, once you're single, start at the beginning.  You got to.  Start at the lowest part of the totem pole and then work your way.  You got to.  Patrice doesn't agree with that.  What do you mean start at the beginning? 
[01:52:00]  Just continue.  Just continue?  Yes.  This is just making sure Anthony continues.  Not start.  Are you kidding me?  So we're trying to get him a prom date.  That's not working too well then.  What's the other idea?  No, because of the criteria.  They put out this whole thing where I'm supposed to take a girl to work prom, but she's got  to put out.  And she's got to put out everywhere.  Well.  So it's like.  Not everywhere.  What do you mean?  Everywhere in her body?  Yeah.  Everywhere around town.  Not everywhere.  Yeah.  I like everywhere around town. 
[01:52:30]  A little of both.  To tell you the truth.  She has to put out in a car, outside, in the public restaurant.  No, she's just got to put out in a certain way that's reserved for.  And good luck with that other way too.  With that giant old log you got.  Yeah.  Jeez.  You know what's amazing?  I would start advertising that you got a big one.  It's going to help you.  In studio, in an XM show, that was what we talked about.  The last time I've been here, we talked about your member.  Yeah.  For an hour and a half straight.  It got really exaggerated.  All right.  What happened?  And it was no good last time, because last time he couldn't even advertise. 
[01:53:00]  It was useless advertising.  Yeah.  So we'll redo it today.  We'll redo it today.  Now it counts.  It counts.  Now you're single.  Hey.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anthony, really fast, because we got the next piece of this puzzle.  So we tried the prom date thing.  That's still happening, but we're not having too much luck.  Then we want to turn your big, huge house into what?  The wayward coke whores.  Wayward coke whores.  We want to invite in wayward coke whores as a front type thing as a rehab center. 
[01:53:30]  But no rehab.  No rehab.  No, no.  There's so much coke in the place.  You rehabilitate them with cocaine in November.  They don't have to clean toilets and make their beds and stuff.  They just got to hang out and do coke.  And nothing's for free.  There's also, you don't want regular coke whores.  You want the wayward ones.  Wayward.  Because they're out.  They're lost.  They look for guidance.  Yeah.  They can't get coke.  He doesn't want the functional ones.  That's boring.  Yeah.  You have the coke. 
[01:54:00]  I got the coke.  And you have a place for them to stay.  Right.  You have everything that they need.  That's it.  Why not have the prom at the coke whorehouse?  Oh, dream come true.  We're working on that.  And then I went with a hot teen, hot pajama party at his house.  Yeah.  Teen pajama party.  We pick all the teenagers up at a mall.  Right.  We blindfold them so they don't really know where Anthony lives.  They have a great time.  Nothing's going to happen illegally there.  It's going to be all legal teenagers in really hot pajamas.  And we're going to put it on Pal Talk.  So the rest of the country could check out a fine teen party at Anthony's house. 
[01:54:30]  Then we have a radio guy pajama party and a shower in the jail that I'm in.  And you could watch that.  Wouldn't be the first time you were in a shower with teenagers.  Why?  When was...  Let me think.  Let me think.  Give him a moment.  Was it in Boston?  It might have been...  Maybe if we did something called the Boston Bean Party.  Oh, and the girls were all covered with beans.  You wanted to make sure that they showered properly. 
[01:55:00]  Yes.  We actually worked at a radio station that had a shower.  And boy, did that come in handy.  And you just put women in there and put big women in there?  Well, Anthony might have went down there for the purpose of the show.  I was videotaping.  It was the show.  The purpose was the show.  I was videotaping illegally.  These wayward bean whores.  A lot of these girls are going to be like, this is what's going to happen to Anthony soon.  A lot of...  Oh, no, no.  Not there.  Inside.  Let it go inside.  All right.  Can I say that?  No.  I don't know. 
[01:55:30]  God damn it.  I just...  I'm trying.  All right.  I know.  A lot of baby folks.  Speaking of the Boston Bean Party in Boston, I found the videotape in a box and I brought  it in and those video clips are going back up on our website.  Oh, wow.  I found an old VHS tape.  It says Boston Bean Party, Blank Piercing, and Lesbian Blank all on one VHS tape that  I handed over to Steve for the website.  I love that you even have that in your box.  We used to do something called the Blue Tarp Cabaret because we decided to get really 
[01:56:00]  messy one day and the fat engineer at the time, he goes, hey, lay down a tarp.  We don't want to mess up the studio.  So it was Blue Tarp.  Blue Tarp Cabaret.  So we turned into the Blue Tarp Cabaret and we would do horrific things on there and  one of them was we got...  I can't even tell you how many gallons of beans we got one day and just got really hot  girls to get naked and then we just completely just made it disgusting.  Maybe the issue is you need to combine everything and do a baked bean, wayward coke, horror, pajama, prom. 
[01:56:30]  Well, we got the next idea because he's...  And single.  We're just trying to help him out.  We're suggesting that maybe he does a speed dating thing.  Speed dating.  Because that's very popular.  TJ, he kind of spends time in L.A.  This is a very...  There's a lot of speed dating out there.  There's a lot of dating when you're on speed, when you're on meth.  See, that's...  I've got a lot of meth dating.  I do, personally.  Here's...  I've seen these things.  Right.  Well, can I play the official promo and then you can...  All right.  Let's play the promo.  Just keep an open mind, will you?  Oh, please. 
[01:57:00]  Are you a white girl about 18 or 19 years of age?  Are you a wild chick?  Have you worked hard to eliminate your gag reflex?  Can you fit 14 golf balls in your mouth?

[01:58:00]  speed dating extravaganza.  You look great for 63.  This is painting me in a very bad light.  First of all, it went up from the wrong age of 57 in the last promo to the wrong age of  63.  I hear no safe word, so, you know, we're going to continue.  I'm explaining.  Okay.  And then, what am I doing? 
[01:58:30]  I'm speed dating, but I'm having sex?  Well, you're speed effing, basically.  Yeah, that's what that is.  That's what I like.  There's no speed dating involved.  No.  No, see, we always have a twist on this stuff.  Yeah, it is a twist, all right?  Anyone can do speed dating.  We want speed effing for you.  You know, I haven't come up with one idea of all this.  It's you guys thinking that this is going to happen.  What do you want, sweetie?  Yeah, why don't you just tell us and we'll stop.  How about, I want a little time? 
[01:59:00]  Time for what?  To what?  We're not talking about sex.  You're talking about relationships?  You want sex right away.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, that's part of my personal life.  Here you go getting square again.  Yeah.  We're trying to get your booty.  This is a booty thing, but what are you talking about?  I don't think I need, I honestly don't think I need your help.  You're very, you're not for booty.  For booty.  You're very, you're ungrateful, man.  Ungrateful?  Yeah, we're coming up with these brilliant ideas.  You guys are trying to set me up in these ideas that are. 
[01:59:30]  Who wouldn't want to do a speed effing?  One by one.  Who wouldn't want to do it?  Me.  But, but.  But you're single.  We're just trying to help.  But the girls that you're after, the girls that you're after, these things here, that's  why you don't need help, but I'm trying to get you outside regular human being.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not computer love.  No computer love.  You want me to find like what?  Like that news woman right there? 
[02:00:00]  Not necessarily her, but just, well, maybe her.  Oh, God.  It's like just some broad waiting at the bus stop.  Would you accept the lesbian party in the Poconos?  What?  Heart-shaped tubs and.  Where is that happening?  And horseback rides.  What do you usually meet women?  In the big champagne glass?  With lesbians.  What do you usually meet women?  What do you say?  Oh, during my entire life, everywhere.  In the Poconos.  Long Island bars.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break and then we can continue with this.  T.J. Miller.  Mastic Beach.  At Comics Tonight and Tomorrow.  I've got to jump out in here because we're going to run out of show and just play commercials  on the way to nine. 
[02:00:30]  That would not be good.  Opie and Anthony, we'll be right back.  Getting ready to wrap this thing up for the weekend.  Off to Cleveland, huh, Anthony?  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, Jimmy's playing though.  I don't know if he's buying it anymore.  Sorry, man.  Earlier in the week, we kind of bought it, but stop.  Sorry, go ahead, go ahead.  I'm sorry about that.  Yeah, what were you saying?  I said I was going to see Jimmy.  I'll be. 
[02:01:00]  That's all you want.  You'll see me at the House of Blues.  Tonight, see Jimmy Norton.  Boo!  Not to Jimmy, by the way.  I wouldn't say that boo.  Jimmy is an hysterical comic.  I'll be seeing him this evening.  And we've got a couple things planned as Jimmy and Anthony are in Cleveland.  Before Jimmy shows, what are you going to do in Cleveland?  Hang out with Jimmy?  Yeah, but.  Mr. Cleveland Aquarium. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, that's what I'm doing.  Going to movies and stuff.  What are you going to do in Cleveland?  Yeah.  Hang out with Jimmy.  See what I mean besides that?  Hold on.  False.  Oh.  There's nothing else.  There's nothing else to do.  In Cleveland?  That answer is true.  Ah.  And puns.  Yeah, of course.  I could listen to him.  I'm going to be.  That answer is false. 
[02:02:00]  Ah.  It won't be on.  I'm going to skate around this question, but are you going to have sex with some scumbag  in Cleveland?  No.  That's good.  That's the way to beat around the bush.  We're beating around the bush, Patrice.  I'm going to skate around and ask him what you want to ask him.  Unless it's Jimmy Norton.  That answer is false.  Oh.  You got a correct answer.  There is some little dirty pals.  I like turtles. 
[02:02:30]  All right, listen.  Why don't we move on?  You're voting for Barack, right?  Vote Barack.  All right.  The safe word has finally come out.  Actually, we turned it into the safe sentence today.  If you were listening earlier, we gave Anthony a chance to bail with a safe word.  He went with Vote Obama as his safe words.  I get this.  Vote Obama.  Safe phrase.  Enjoy Jimmy and enjoy Cleveland.  Jimmy Norton. 
[02:03:00]  Hey, one in 100 Americans are in jail.  That's what we're learning today.  One in 100.  Really?  It's not really that much.  You don't think that's a lot?  That's crazy.  I don't know how to do the math on that.  300 million people.  Divvy that up by demo.  Yeah, but you got to think.  We're fine.  Oh, wow.  30 million Americans.  That answer is...  True.  True.  Ah.  Sorry.  There it happens.  One for Whitey. 
[02:03:30]  You got to think that the three out of those 100 Americans probably should be in jail.  You know?  Yeah.  What's that?  30 million people in jail?  Hmm?  Oh, that would be 10%.  Isn't that what that is?  That's 1%.  You just insulted that.  So 300,000.  You insulted Bob Vecchio.  You're not good at math.  3 million.  3 million people in jail.  Not bad.  If there's 300 million Americans, yeah, that would be 3 million.  3 million.  Okay.  Fair enough.  Then we got...  What else?  Oh, wow. 
[02:04:00]  Mike Smith of Dave Clark 5 dies.  Who?  Exactly.  Who of who?  And how about this one?  Study shows kids who are spanked have sexual problems later in life.  Oops.  Oh, that's weird.  Isn't that weird?  That spanking leads to weird anal fetishes later in life?  How could that be?  Didn't we all get spanked as kids?  Silence.  Didn't everybody...  What about the spankings that people get as adults?  Yeah.  Those are the worst ones. 
[02:04:30]  What do those lead to?  Well, you're just trying to read the spanking you had as a kid.  That's what they're basically trying to say.  Really?  Children who are spanked are given some form of physical punishment by their parents may  be more likely to have sexual problems as adults.  A study, co-director, get to the juice here, found that children who suffer physical punishment  in the form of spanking, hitting, or slapping are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior  as adults.  What is...  A study presented Thursday to the American Psychological Association suggests that spanked 
[02:05:00]  children are also more likely to be physically or verbally coercing to a sexual partner  and engage in mass...  Massage...  Massacistic sex.  Massacistic.  Massacistic.  Massacistic.  Thank you.  Including arousal by spanking later in life.  Oh.  That's great, too.  That I was...  I knew what masochistic had to pronounce that.  Massacistic.  That's great things about me.  Massachistic.  There is...  Massachusetts.  Yeah.  Engage in intercourse in Massachusetts.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  So...  That's coming out today.  Well...  Were you spanked as a kid, TJ?  I was not.  My father...  Oh, yeah.  You're too young.  How old are you again?  I'm 26.  Yeah.  You weren't spanked.  My father used to...  Anyone under 30, I don't think, got spanked as a kid.  Really?  No.  That's when that all came out that it's bad to spank.  I got the S-beat out of me.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Mikey did.  Oh, yeah.  TMZ Mike.  The TMZ kid.  Yeah.  The TMZ kid got the crap kicked out of what?  The old belt.  Yeah.  The belt.  Did he get the belt? 
[02:06:00]  Belt, sticks.  The belt, the spoon, the shoe.  Wooden spoons.  Not a metal spoon, because a wooden spoon would break.  Wow.  Yep.  Wow.  That's hard.  No wonder you're a cop.  And do you have...  Do you have sexual...  I love my mommy.  Do you have sexual dysfunction because of it?  Yeah.  Oh, of course.  No thought to it.  Who does that?  Yeah, absolutely.  Hot wheel tracks.  You ever get a hot wheel track to the back of the leg?  I think I still got the mock.  Hot wheel track was rough.  Yeah.  The orange hot wheel track.  Yeah.  Those things like...  My father is the reason you're getting beat. 
[02:06:30]  Indiana Jones.  You always gotta go black.  Patrice is lucky that you didn't have a father, so you didn't get beat as a kid.  No, he got the switch.  My mother...  Beat the crap out of you?  Even worse, right?  My mother punched me.  She tied phone books on me and hit me with...  To make sure no one saw the scars.  She tied phone books on you and then beat you?  I remember beatings.  I remember actual beatings and why.  And I always didn't think I deserved them.  Really?  I used to be a terrible pyromaniac, man, and I needed a beating.  I would have burned it down.  Wow, you like burning stuff down? 
[02:07:00]  I just like burning things, yeah.  Yeah.  We like burning our own woods, but that was about it.  Do you have sexual dysfunction because of Patrice?  I don't know if it was because she beat me, but I definitely probably...  Does he have it?  I don't think a sexual dysfunction counts if you don't think it is.  So, like, I'm not going to say...  Dude, you walked around with a briefcase filled with, you know, sexual aids.  But I...  That's a bit of a defunction.  According to you...  I give you one or two.  You walked around like a businessman.  First of all, a briefcase.  You had glass ones, wooden ones, plastic ones.  Can I say that I didn't walk around with it? 
[02:07:30]  I brought it in to...  We made you cry that day.  ...be ridiculed?  But that's when you...  What are you talking about?  Well, we didn't make you cry, but we made you question some things.  I remember that show.  You were showing us.  You were bragging about all these things on your briefcase.  I wasn't bragging.  And we looked you right in the eye and we go,  What is wrong?  What are you doing?  Why are you elaborating on what happened?  Don't make me play the bit again.  Play it.  You said, come on in.  This was when you came back.  You got a little sad after that visit.  This was Vengeance Opie.  Just back from the radio, Vengeance Opie.  Making people wait outside.  Yep. 
[02:08:00]  Do things like that.  What the hell?  And I got mad because you was cheating.  Oh, remember that?  Yeah.  Like I was a dildo salesman.  Well, here's the thing, though.  I brought in my dildos to show you.  That's what I did.  If you have them in a briefcase, that does imply you may be selling them.  What am I going to do?  Bring them in all my pockets?  I put them where they were clean.  They were nice.  They're gorgeous.  How many did you have in that one briefcase?  Be honest.  20?  30?  Did you take, I'll ask you this, and this will solve the whole thing. 
[02:08:30]  This will solve the whole thing.  Did you take that briefcase down to Brazil with you?  No.  That entire briefcase full of dildos?  No.  No.  How many did you take?  Three.  In a briefcase?  And I take three for my enjoyment, and then I always bring gifts for the young ladies.  I never went empty-handed.  It was always here, take this, and enjoy.  They used to like it.  Were they dildos?  Yeah.  And was it a briefcase that you had handcuffed to your wrist?  No.  That's what I want to know. 
[02:09:00]  No.  It was like a secret agent dildo briefcase.  I'm getting a little old, and I can't just-  The nuclear weapon comes.  I had a lot of chicks hanging around at the time, and I didn't want to just sleep with  a thousand women, and so I had fun.  It was fun tools.  Yeah.  Do you suggest Anthony gets a briefcase of-  I definitely suggest his-  Anthony, maybe that's what you need.  What else does he need?  I don't think I want that.  I think he needs a sex swing, too, in the big house.  He needs a sex swing?  A sex swing for one of the rooms you're not using.  What's he going to need a sex swing for?  Or a-  Could you stop pretending like you're 52-year-old log still- 
[02:09:30]  You know you got soft spots in it.  I'm not even-  No.  You know it's like those new bottles of water that aren't made with the full plastic.  It's the-  I-  You know it's a little bit of-  It's a soft spot.  I'd put it up against anyone's of any age, my friend.  There's no way.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  There's no way.  Yes, sir.  Just because you eat cantaloupe every day doesn't mean it doesn't-  I know you got to slap it hard a couple of times just to get it to you.  No, sir.  You must talk to it. 
[02:10:00]  I would-  It gets raging still.  I think Patrice is a bit jealous.  I would-  Absolutely.  Patrice, are you a bit-  Absolutely.  I don't know how big it is.  I know mine.  I like a bigger one.  What?  I would like a bigger one.  Oh.  What?  For-  No, I would like a bigger one for me.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Well, but for you and one guy.  For a second, he's like, no, I prefer larger ones.  What are you trying to imply?  Gayness?  What are you-  Stop it.  Just because we're trying to have fun, you ass.  Can you stop ignoring us to have fun on this show?  Ever since Anthony broke up with his girl, fun has stopped.  Fun has stopped. 
[02:10:30]  So you still get raging-  So you're blaming Anthony?  Yes.  You get raging.  Raging.  Really?  Yes.  Purple helmet raging.  Purple.  Raging.  Just say raging.  Are you serious?  Just say-  I'm serious.  I know you got gray ball hair, too.  Will you stop?  We can't put that on the radio.  This is like going to be dumped out of-  He's back in the back hall, the dump guy going, oh, Jesus, I'm running out.  Is this dumping?  I'm running out.  There's a few dumps.  You can't describe anything like that.  Let's go to a sexual deviant story because we did the spanking thing. 
[02:11:00]  It leads to this guy.  114 counts of secret peeping.  That's what North Carolina authorities are charging a 31-year-old employee with at this  old Navy store.  He was recording ladies as they went in to change in the dressing room.  The employee, Calvin Lee Johnson, allegedly started taping women trying on clothes January  29th.  Three weeks later, a woman on Valentine's Day complained she saw someone pointing a camera  under the dressing room door.  Police say they now have 53 digital images of white females that they want to identify. 
[02:11:30]  The incident has fueled outrage among shoppers.  It's your own personal self and your own dressing.  I think it is wrongfully done.  I mean, that's invading your prophecy right there.  The manager at the Old Navy store says he's deeply troubled and saddened by the incident.  From the first moment that we were made aware of the situation, we have fully cooperated  with law enforcement, and I would want the community to know that the safety of making  our customers comfortable is our top priority here at Old Navy. 
[02:12:00]  Meanwhile, Johnson is currently behind bars.  His bond's set at $110,000.  Could the guy be any more boring reporting the story?  Why pick an Old Navy?  What is this guy doing?  If you're going to do this, do it somewhere where there's bound to be attractive women.  Listen to the women that they interviewed.  It's your own personal self.  It is your body, and it's a violation of the self of your person.  It was a black guy, too, by the way.  He's picking.  Black guy?  Doing the peeve of it.  It was all white women, remember? 
[02:12:30]  Because they had to let us know it was all white women.  Oh, okay.  That's why they said that?  His name is Calvin Johnson.  Yeah, I know.  You're black unless you're a president with that name.  Calvin Johnson.  Unless you're a president.  But that's a black guy's name.  President Calvin Johnson will now talk.  Hello, I'm Calvin Johnson.  And if you're a black peep in time, you would go to Old Navy to do that.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Why Old Navy?  Could you get regular white women?  Regular hope.  That's what he's into.  Get maybe the jeans that are slightly bigger. 
[02:13:00]  Banana Republic.  Yeah.  Wow.  Old Navy.  All right, it got a little intense in here the last 15 minutes.  Why do you say that?  Everybody all right?  Why are you saying that?  Are you all right?  Why are you saying it's intense?  You always got to be like it's intense.  Are you all right?  Always.  I'm cool, man.  All right.  What the hell is wrong with you?  You're yelling.  Oh, that's wrong.  I'm cool, if anybody.  I'm fine.  I know we had a moment with that briefcase thing, but I'll... 
[02:13:30]  It's no moment.  We had a moment.  It's no moment.  Because we looked at you and said, what are you doing?  And then we're questioning some things after that.  I remember it.  I remember that.  We're going to have to talk about that.  All right.  We'll talk about it another day.  I thought we were getting some stuff done that day, but I guess not.  Getting some work done.  Here's what you did that day.  You went, what happened to you?  Yeah.  And I got nothing.  I was a little...  Okay, so you'll admit that.  Yes.  I got to a little bit.  Nothing happened.  Just a little, though.  But I just realized I put them all in a briefcase, and I never had to put them all together 
[02:14:00]  in one area.  Right.  And I go, wow, that is a lot of dildos.  It was a lot.  It was a lot.  Patrice was so excited that day.  He's just taking them out one by one.  And this is my Willie Mays rookie card.  Willie Mays.  It was like, remember when you were a kid and you were checking out someone's baseball  card collection?  I had one called Wonder Boy.  Yeah.  See, he had names for all of them.  I mean, that's great.  And we were in shock, and we're like, it's a show and tell.  Made out of an oak tree that a lightning hit in the back of my house.  We were just in shock, and we're like, what are you doing?  That's all. 
[02:14:30]  That's all I'm saying.  Listen.  Yes.  I'm trying to help.  Yeah, I think we helped Anthony today.  All you do is help.  That's nice.  So what's it going to be, Anthony?  How are you going to get this thing done with these women?  I don't know what the thing is.  We'll have to see what other promotions Opie can come up with.  Jimmy can come up with.  Are you up with the speed dating?  No, not as described on, no.  Why?  We made it special for you.  Speed effing.  Because it's insanity.  Let's try for the lesbian weekend in the Poconos. 
[02:15:00]  I like the lesbian weekend in the Poconos.  I'll tell you what.  Are you in Cleveland?  Are you in Cleveland all weekend?  With the bubbly champagne?  Yeah.  Are you in Cleveland all weekend?  If you come to my show at Comics on Saturday, I'll bring you on stage.  I'll do a speed dating thing right there.  He's going to be in Cleveland.  Why would I want to do that?  Because I can easily get you laid right after the show.  Easily.  I can do that.  Why don't you get some Cloverfield booty instead of a town talk?  We're still on the air.  Why don't you get a little?  He's offering you a Cloverfield booty, dude. 
[02:15:30]  This is big blockbuster booty he's offering.  All right.  Why don't we...  This is suspension of disbelief, buddy.  Right.  Wheel is falling off of the show.  Now he's just got to tape it.  And he's got to record everything with his camcorder now.  He just shakily records everything.  Shaky camera movement.  Hey, I want to say hi to Cleveland once again.  Anthony, we'll be in your fine city later on today.  Yep.  Jimmy sold out shows at the House of Blues.  And a couple surprises, hopefully, for Cleveland while you guys are up there, right? 
[02:16:00]  Can't wait.  And maybe we'll have a full report on Monday.  We're not really sure yet, though.  We'll see.  T.J. Miller, comics here in New York City tonight and tomorrow night.  C-O-M-I-X-N-Y.com for details.  That's right.  We've got to go.  We'll see you guys.  Bye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  Thank you. 
[02:19:00]  Thank you. 
[02:19:30]  Thank you. 
[02:20:00]  Because it's not so dramatic to play that in the middle of a radio show.  Yeah, I know.  The beginning is kind of like, oh, here we go.  It's kind of neat, right?  Yeah.  Where's Patrice?  Oh, no.  My zipper's stuck.  Oh, no. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, look at this guy.  Yeah, he's got to make his smooth entrance.  Yeah, look at him being all smooth and shit.  You are.  Are we going to fight?  Look at that thing.  Sit down.  Let's talk.  Are we going to what?  Let's talk.  Yeah, you want to fight.  It's good radio.  I don't want to fight.  I like to fight.  I'm a fighter.  I don't want to be friends, but...  Is that coat warm?  I like that.  Then I can sing the song.  Fight.  Fight.  Nigger in a white?  You can't say that.  See?  You can say it.  And that...  The white can't fight because the nigger's out of sight. 
[02:21:00]  Ah.  Did you have one for the white boys?  No, the white boys.  What?  Which one?  Like when...  No, they would just punch us.  White can't dance.  Yeah, as we're singing that goofy song, we're getting punched in the face numerous times.  Yeah, you're right.  We suck.  Whitey sucks, Patrice.  I'm with you.  Whitey's stupid.  Yeah, your run is about over.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  Our world domination.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, beautiful.  So done.  Can you...  Time for the Puerto Ricans to step in.  We're going to...  Something should happen.  I know...  We're going to get right into the show today because we got Victoria standing by. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, Victoria?  You guys are in the same field.  Victoria Zidrock?  Zidrock.  God bless her, man.  What a great...  I was reading some of this.  This is...  You read her book?  No, what is it?  Oh.  On scoring?  Dr. Z on scoring?  Let me tell you something.  We had her in a couple weeks ago and she was very entertaining, but we were thinking,  we got to get Patrice in with this woman because you're in the same field and Patrice  will soon be writing his sex slash relationship book.  So we are what you call colleagues. 
[02:22:00]  Hey, how are you?  All right.  And she likes to take out her boobies and stuff.  There you go.  Oh, she's a very smart woman to use that in her advantage.  Yeah, absolutely.  Why be like these other fucking idiots and not use what you...  Right, got to use it.  What's your worst?  You're dotted, right?  Your body.  Look at the young TJ looking.  Excited.  Very excited.  I'm TJ.  TJ was in a big Hollywood movie.  Oh, yeah?  Cloverfield.  And you know what?  The fact that she has a vagina almost makes her as important as everyone in here. 
[02:22:30]  That's the good thing about having a vagina.  Yeah.  It ups their level.  Vagina power.  Yeah.  You got to know the power of your vagina.  I hope you brought your A game.  I want to do something right away.  I want TJ and you to switch seats.  I need a buffer between you two.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, because you're going to get distracted by her eyes and stuff.  I need her across the studio.  They are blazingly beautiful.  Thank you.  TJ, I'm serious.  Could you guys just switch seats?  My goodness.  Just a lovely woman.  I kind of like these seats.  I know.  You guys are too close, though.  Oh, boy.  You might intimidate my buddy Patrice. 
[02:23:00]  I doubt it, but.  She's gorgeous.  Damn.  Look at her.  Well-dressed.  Very sharp.  Very clean looking.  Look at the bra that barely covers up the boobies through the shirt that is see-through.  Right?  Nice look.  The matching bra, too.  Matching bra?  Very important.  Very important.  So now I'm the buffer between Patrice.  Very important to who?  Well, important to everyone.  No, not men, but it's important to women.  Well, here it is.  It's important.  I think it's important to dress well.  I think Anglo-Saxon American women can dress.  They can, but it doesn't mean anything to Anglo-Saxon American men, by the way. 
[02:23:30]  We don't even care if you can read, let alone write a book.  All right, hold on.  No, I think you do care.  I mean, men care for, like, a nice, tight dress versus, like, something baggy with sneakers.  Not really.  Just whatever's easier to get off.  Hey, Patrice, really fast before we get into this, I want to say hi to Jeremy in Cleveland.  We got a Maxwell update.  People are dying for their Maxwell update.  Yes, Jeremy.  Hi, guys.  No Maxwell show yesterday.  All messed up because he felt threatened because his home address and Google map was put on 
[02:24:00]  Doug on my bank.  Oops.  Well, he started it, and I think he needs to go on the air and go, look, I made a mistake,  and I'm going to shut up now, and then we stop.  See, I know a little birdie.  Oh, you know a little birdie?  Well, I really strongly suggest that the pests do not stop.  Yeah.  Just make sure you're not doing anything that's illegal.  Nothing illegal.  You don't need to do anything illegal.  You just go on there and make his life a living hell on the air.  And if you know the station manager's email, just go, look, you know, someone talked for 
[02:24:30]  the pest and go, look, it's very easy.  If Maxwell goes on the air and says, I made a mistake by attacking this much bigger radio  show, if he goes on and says, I made a mistake, then we'll certainly stop this thing.  But until then, it keeps going and going and going.  Because these dopes in Cleveland think it's a cute one, two, three-day battle.  It really isn't.  It really isn't.  We've been calling everybody.  We're calling about his drug use.  We're calling all the sponsors, because they talk about, he's an ex-heroin addict, and  Sandsbury talks about smoking weed and drinking. 
[02:25:00]  Does he?  So we're going to call their sponsors and have them drop, because we don't like the drug  talk.  Benjamin.  There you go.  So keep up the fight, fellas.  Benny Bornstein, is he going to be down there?  Yeah, Anthony's going to be in Cleveland tonight.  Jimmy's doing the House of Blues tonight, and it should get interesting.  Stop by and say hi.  I think we're going to tape a few things for everybody while we're up there.  Thank you, Jeremy.  Thank you to all the pests out there.  We knew you guys were still alive, and we greatly appreciate the fight. 
[02:25:30]  All right.  The brawlage.  Now, Patrice, let me explain here.  Victoria, right?  I forgot your name already.  She gave him the iciest stare.  Watch out.  She gave him the you're not scoring stare.  You know what it is?  You remember me by Dr. Z.  Dr. Z, okay.  And it's an important point.  Like, remember her name.  How do you pronounce this beautiful ass name, by the way, man?  The Drac.  The Drac.  By the way, we got spies all over the place.  I don't want to steal spy rapport, because that's Ron and Fez's thing, but we do have  our own spies, and they like to communicate with us. 
[02:26:00]  And they said that you only gave us, like, topless, and on Howard's show, you were writing,  like, sex toys.  What's that about?  Well, you guys don't have any sex toys.  You would actually write a sex thing if we had one?  I brought my own Sibian, because I told him I didn't know where his has been.  And it's like, you know, he's got all kinds of skanky girls on that show.  So I brought my very own Sibian to his show.  People were really mad that we only got, like, boobies.  But I was also on, like, ten times, and, you know, on his show.  So we have to work up to penetration?  Yes.  Work up to Sibian. 
[02:26:30]  You have to work it up.  I've been on so many times, there's only so many tricks you could do.  Right.  But, by the way, he said I had the ugliest last name ever.  Now, that's insulting.  How is that insulting?  He just scored a major point.  He said, I have a beautiful last name.  It's a joke.  Howard thought it was ugly.  He thought it was a gross last name, Zedrak.  I think it's great.  It has power.  I think it's just lacking.  Zedrak.  Strong consonant.  Exactly.  Something like zebra.  You can't just look the word zebra.  You can't ignore it. 
[02:27:00]  Zeal, zebra, zap.  She's got the last name of a scientist.  Zedrak.  I mean, because everybody's here.  I was a father of hydrogen bomb.  Was the Zedrak family in Mother Russia.  Very good scientist.  Zedrak.  Zedrak.  We drink vodka.  Very important in my country.  Now I drive cab.  Yeah.  Dr. Z.  Patrice O'Neill has a very unique way of looking, 
[02:27:30]  which is very smart, by the way,  and very brilliant.  Thanks, man.  Very logical.  And why is Mike fooling around with a strap-on dildo over there?  Mike?  Oh, Jesus.  The TMZ kid's got a dildo in his hand.  Why?  Bored?  So Patrice has a very unique way of looking at love and relationships  that is a little different than yours.  That's why we invited Patrice in here today.  That's good.  I mean, you gave some great advice last time you were on the show,  but you haven't heard Patrice's angle yet.  Yeah.  My angle is just basically to cut out the editing system within men. 
[02:28:00]  There's a system that we have, excuse me,  where at the bottom of your gut, you have a feeling.  And women can go from the bottom of that gut.  I read in a couple of chapters of your book,  there's some things here that's basically just bottom of the gut things  where this is what makes us happy.  Men have an editing system in the middle before it gets to our mouth and brain  where we're always trying to make someone else feel better 
[02:28:30]  before we open our mouths.  And I'm trying to cut that editing system out  so that actually women can really truly understand what we want  as opposed to, like, no offense, good things in your book,  but it's almost like this book is like if a fish was writing a book to fishermen  to say how to catch me.  You understand?  Yeah, exactly.  Why would I need help from a fish on how to catch you?  That makes no sense, doesn't exist.  That goes against what you really are.  This book is, there's no book on how to get men. 
[02:29:00]  There's no book that a woman could write on how to get men to get you.  It doesn't make any sense.  This is more of a woman power thing.  I think you have enough power in this game, in the relationship game.  That's what I think.  I don't think that you need help.  Because that's what this book is basically, helping women.  It's not helping men.  Because what we do, this is completely against what we are, animal-wise.  Not really.  This is a book on editing.  Like, to give us tips, like one, I read one thing which says one to ten, 
[02:29:30]  the worst things to talk about during a date.  Right, right, right.  Don't talk about religion.  Don't talk about, it's like, what is there to talk about?  You're saying what you don't want to talk about.  Again, this is for you.  This is not for us.  No, no, no.  But you don't, you listen.  That's the idea.  These are shortcuts.  Do you want to, do you want to...  Shortcuts to what?  Into her panties.  These are the shortcuts.  If you're going to start talking about religion,  if you're going to start talking about your mother,  it's going to take you longer to get, if you're going to listen... 
[02:30:00]  But ultimately, there is no shortcut.  Because, see, shortcuts to a woman's panties ends up being long cuts to my fucking life.  Do you know what I mean?  Meaning, you are not teaching women on how to give up pussy and walk away.  It doesn't exist.  No, I'm not teaching women.  I'm not teaching.  I'm teaching guys how to get beautiful women fast.  And, yeah, sometimes...  This is nothing fast.  We're looking for, hey, how are you?  Listen, can I just stick my finger in?  That's what we're looking for. 
[02:30:30]  You just basically...  This is a how to pick up women.  This doesn't exist.  This doesn't exist.  But, I mean, no disrespect to this book.  But, again, we're talking...  See how free you get to be when you tell a guy,  here's how you get us.  But why don't you listen to how we want to get you?  Because we're masters at getting.  But, see, here's what you guys don't do.  Women don't...  You should write a book on how to keep a man.  Which is your job.  Well, I don't need to keep a man.  I have a hard time getting rid of them, right? 
[02:31:00]  So, uh...  On what level, though?  Let's be honest here.  Getting rid of them?  Is that what your life is?  Getting rid of men?  That's not even...  That's against your nature.  No, no, exactly.  But I don't need a book on keep a man.  Do you know what I mean?  You do need a book on keeping a man.  And I'm not writing for women, you know?  I mean, I'm writing for guys.  So, basically, when you say you don't need a book...  This is an insight into how to score women that look like me.  That is impossible.  You know how to score you?  How do you do that?  Well, I know how to score...  Because I know how to score these kind of women. 
[02:31:30]  I've hooked up with these women before.  How do you do it?  How do I score you?  Well...  Can any guy score you?  Of course.  Okay.  I've slept with hundreds of men.  Therefore, there's plenty of women.  That's beautiful.  I like you a lot for saying that, by the way.  You slept with hundreds?  That's fantastic.  To be really honest, I had a very promiscuous young life.  And is that continued?  Because you've got to either hole them up or hole them down, to be honest with you. 
[02:32:00]  Could that continue this afternoon?  What I'm saying is like...  Promiscuity.  She's not answering you.  No, promise...  But what I'm saying is that there are certain kind of men that turn women on naturally.  And the men that listen, the men...  You know what?  It's very simple.  If you just say to a woman, how do you feel about that?  A woman's going to love you.  Because guess what?  You're strong but sensitive to me.  That's all you're going to say.  No, there's no thinking.  You're adding too much thinking to what guys want.  But there is no thinking.  It's too hard.  There you go.  And here's what you're doing right now. 
[02:32:30]  You're telling...  It's an actual more feeling.  You're telling...  This is the thing.  You're telling...  Like, say if I'm a shark swimming around the ocean, you got in the water and just told  a shark how to be a shark, and you're a tuna.  Like, how do you tell me how to be what I am?  Do you feel me?  Like, we don't want to...  I don't want to tell you what you are.  We already know what you are.  All this stuff we...  In this book...  A lot of it, anyway.  I didn't read the whole book.  It's things that we already do, but we don't want to do.  That's why we're losing our existence, which was a complete lie. 
[02:33:00]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  No, but...  We lie.  We don't go from our gut to our mouth.  But I don't encourage guys to lie.  This is what you're encouraging.  No, no.  If I want to talk about religion, why can't I talk about religion?  You can talk about religion, but chances are, if she's of a different religion, she's going  to get turned off and walk away.  Right here...  That's the...  There we go.  It's the arrogance.  It's better you find out right away, though.  Who gives a shit?  Right. 
[02:33:30]  This is the problem we have.  It's all about what is turning you...  Fuck you.  Like, not trying to be offensive, but fuck what you want, because really what it boils  down to is your vagina.  But do you want to get laid or not?  It comes down to how badly do you want to get there?  That's nothing!  There you go.  You're weighing your existence.  This guy here, right?  T.J. Miller.  T.J. Miller.  T.J. Miller.  The great T.J. Miller.  Fucking in an $80 million blockbuster movie, right?  Right. 
[02:34:00]  I'm going to tell you that a vagina, he had to be in a movie.  He has to be at comics.  He has to be doing what he's doing in life to get some kind of stature just to get your  pussy.  This is what I'm saying.  Women never offer up...  Yours specifically, by the way.  I've been doing all this for yours specifically.  That's what I'm saying.  It doesn't impress you, but it fucking should.  The fact that I have to have a goddamn good credit.  I have to have a nice...  No, no, no.  Who gives a shit about good credit?  I don't talk about good credit. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, I'm sorry.  You talk about everything else.  I talk about a bad boy.  I talk about being spontaneous and risk-taking.  Who cares?  I talk about sense of humor.  I talk about confidence and authority.  We already know.  What do you have to have besides a twat?  Definitely not good credit.  Besides a twat, what do women have to have to get a man?  You don't have to be charming.  How do you get a man without your pussy?  How would you get a man?  That is interesting.  Dr. Z, if you didn't have a pussy, how would you get a man?  How would you? 
[02:35:00]  Well, you know, there's plenty of guys who are into things other than the pussy, unfortunately.  But I like to ask...  I'm just asking the question.  If you didn't have a vagina...  This is...  I just...  I get very passionate about this.  Don't think I'm attacking you.  You know...  Wait a second, because here's what you're about to do.  You're about to do some woman stuff.  You're not going to answer the question.  You're going to spin it into actually something else.  You know, I've been to Rio de Janeiro, and if you watch Rio de Janeiro, you see these women in quotations  that stand there, and then you see guys pulling over and getting blowjobs. 
[02:35:30]  Guess what?  These are not women.  These are transsexuals.  This is exactly what I'm saying.  And guys love them.  What the fuck?  Vaginas have nothing to do with this.  We that had nothing to do with the question.  See, I'm pretty magical with this shit.  I knew you was going to switch it up.  But what I'm saying is...  I'm telling you, vaginas have nothing to do with this.  There is no...  It has everything to do with it.  Vagina...  There's no guy in here that's ever gotten pussy in their life because they have a dick.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[02:36:00]  Meaning, we can't just go, look at this dick, ladies.  We have to have a skill level, a charm level.  We have to have a fucking...  How many pages?  A 400-page book to read to figure out how to fuck beautiful women.  What do...  Have you ever charmed your way into dick?  Have you ever talked your way into anything?  Have you ever been charming?  Absolutely.  Have you ever taken a man out to dinner who didn't want to give you dick, but you fucking  talked your way into it?  Actually...  You talked your way into dick before? 
[02:36:30]  I have.  Believe it or not.  Really?  To a man that didn't want to fuck you?  Really?  What did you do?  What were some of those charming things you did to make me want to fuck you and I didn't  want to at first?  I think what Patrice is saying...  Wait a minute, TJ, because here's why we fucked up.  Okay.  Because TJ, this is what we do.  We don't have ball togetherness, men.  Nope.  Because this is what makes us even...  This is what makes us better than women, too.  TJ, just sit back and enjoy.  TJ is going to go, ooh, this is a good time to play good cop, bad cop.  Right?  Where it's like, oh, see, Patrice, this is what he's doing.  And no offense, but he's going to... 
[02:37:00]  He'll do anything to fuck you.  This is what he's doing.  But for the basic part of it, we have an objective.  And you don't understand this objective.  Yeah, you have a revolutionary objective to fuck as many women as you can.  And you have an evolutionary objective to fuck one guy as much as you can.  Exactly.  Where's your skill to do that?  What do you mean my skill to do that?  Where's your skill to fuck...  Instead of pretending that these hundreds of men you're proud of, you really want one  guy that you can call your man. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, but how are you having that?  How are you keeping this guy?  How do you think I keep that guy?  The good one.  How do you...  Ask me a question with a question.  This is what I'm saying.  This is what...  This is all I'm saying is...  How do I keep him?  It's hard for them to admit what they are...  Exactly!  Why?  This is what the fuck...  This is what they boil themselves down to.  He's standing up.  He's standing up.  They boil themselves down to sex.  And...  Why are we supposed to make them better?  Why are we supposed to make them better than what they think their self is? 
[02:38:00]  And I also make a good living.  Much better living than my man does.  So that helps me well.  Which is why your relationship is on the way out anyway.  Because you can't deal with having a guy that's less cool than you.  Oh, he's not less cool.  He absolutely is.  He's a man that's not better than his woman.  Why is he not better?  Because he doesn't make as much money as you.  But that doesn't define somebody better or worse.  It does for you.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, you look at a king.  You ask me why?  You want a king in your life?  Is he your king?  Yeah, he's my king.  How's he your king when you're above him and you're the queen?  I don't think I'm above him.  Queen, king don't exist. 
[02:38:30]  It's king, queen.  I don't think I'm above him.  I bet you're better than him.  No, I'm not better than him.  You're just enjoying your control right now.  But now, as soon as you get done with him, he'll be gone.  I'm not done with him.  I mean, we're economic relationship.  You don't know how to make yourself happy.  And not you.  Women.  This is what it boils down to.  I'm an extremely happy person.  There's no way you're happy with a man that's less cool than you.  I don't think he's less cool.  He's a super cool guy.  Absolutely less cool than you.  Just because he makes less money doesn't make him cool. 
[02:39:00]  We're not going to get to see boobies today.  Huh?  Nothing, nothing.  You got it, Patrice.  Go ahead.  Continue.  I'm just saying you're not tapping in.  Listen, I love what I read.  But you're not tapping into the animal that you're dealing with.  You're tapping into you, which is what women do.  You don't tap into us.  Us is a different thing from you.  And you need to learn about us from us, not from you.  Well, Patrice has a different way of looking at relationships and stuff like that. 
[02:39:30]  No, I certainly see.  Patrice doesn't like commitment, doesn't like, he doesn't want to be married, likes to keep  his woman.  Doesn't like the bullshit of the chase.  Don't be fair.  I don't dislike commitment.  What I don't like, Opie, is I don't like an unhappy guy, a traditional unhappy guy.  I don't like a guy.  I don't like an unhappy guy either.  But you have no choice to that.  I'm not that big on commitment myself.  I think most marriages should be open marriages on both sides.  But that's not to your nature.  You decided to go with the guys.  My nature? 
[02:40:00]  Women's nature.  Women's nature is not to have...  What is a women's nature?  Of course.  Because you're talking about years of a millennium of evolution.  It's not to have a hundred different dicks in you.  I don't mind it.  But that's not what you crave is a hundred different dicks.  You want one dick that you love.  You don't want to...  When you say you want a hundred different dicks, you're being a guy.  But you're not being a guy.  A couple.  You'd be surprised.  You know what?  Women are cheating as much as men do now.  Doesn't matter.  They're miserable when they're doing it.  Not always miserable. 
[02:40:30]  Women are miserable.  You know why?  Because there's no satisfaction to how you get dick.  You get dick by opening your legs.  Do you understand?  You can sit here and you sit there and you spread your legs.  And just go, fellas, one of you, would you like to touch it?  We'll all go, yeah.  If you had a room full of women and a dick came out and it's like, put your hands on it, ladies.  You would all go, ew, because it doesn't matter.  How you get dick?  You've been hanging out with the wrong women, Patrice.  I know you try to be different, but we all know. 
[02:41:00]  Uh-uh.  I don't know.  We all know that you're a girl.  You sit down to pee.  You have kids.  You do things that make you...  What's so bad about being a girl?  Oh, it's just...  Look, I've done girl things.  Do you ever think you had to take a shit, but you just peed?  And you're just sitting there and sitting down peeing and how miserable you was just sitting down.  Like, what a bitch you felt like.  How demoralized you are by going, ugh, I'm sitting down to pee.  Do you ever lay back and pretend, like, play fuck with your girl and put yourself in missionary position just for a game? 
[02:41:30]  And the idea of someone laying...  You're laying on your back with your legs back and someone is fucking you?  It is embarrassing.  Bleeding every month for no reason?  You are miserable.  God made you miserable.  You know what guys do that's fun?  We have an activity where once in a while, maybe me, once every other day, I kill life.  I squirt life anywhere on my girl's chest, on a sock, on a... 
[02:42:00]  Anywhere.  There's no activity where a woman enjoys just killing eggs.  There's no activity where they go, yay, there's an egg on the floor.  This is why you're miserable, because you're...  And your happiness, wait a minute, your happiness is based on thinking you're a man.  Wait, but if...  So you want women to have, like, eggs roll out of their body and then just take a hammer and just start smashing their eggs?  They don't understand what it's like to be frivolous. 
[02:42:30]  They're not frivolous with their body.  That's why I know a hundred guys, fucking a hundred guys, means nothing to a woman.  It's not happiness, because there's no gratification to it.  There's no hunt.  You know what you're hunting?  Love.  And you don't know how to get it.  Yeah, some women hunt love.  You hope this guy that you fuck will love you.  It's scratching the lottery.  You don't know how to get love.  Have no clue.  Wow.  All right, let's talk to Steve Carter.  Wow.  So it's your rant on how great it is to be a man. 
[02:43:00]  You know it, because your book...  So why do you think...  You're on the men's side, not on the women's side.  This book says it right here.  You're on our side.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, fair enough.  But let me tell you, why do you think so many men out there, so many men, and they email me all  day long, want to be women?  And how come majority of transsexuals and transvestites dress up as women?  So they can have control over what they don't have control over.  Yeah, exactly.  So who is miserable here?  The majority of transsexuals are men, male to female. 
[02:43:30]  They're miserable.  They all want to be girls.  They all want to be submissive.  They all want to be slaves.  They just want to control pussy.  They all want to dress up.  They all want to dress up in girly clothes.  That's why pimps are loved.  People love pimps.  Not because they can put women on the street and make them sell their pussy, but the mind  of how do I control something that's controlled by an unlikable creature.  Like, you're awful.  If I control pussy, boy, pussy be great.  I don't know about that.  I would break the value of pussy down to zero if I owned a pussy. 
[02:44:00]  You know what, I think the majority of men would love to be a woman.  That's why so many, it's one of the biggest fetishes.  Are you serious what?  Sit down and pay?  Are guys wearing female panties?  That's huge.  It's control.  It's huge on the internet.  It's to have an idea of how it is to control the vagina because God has given a miserable  animal the power to control something to make us happy.  Yeah, Patrice hates vaginas. 
[02:44:30]  I can see that.  He already likes the vagina.  He just doesn't like all the shit that's around it and the shit it takes.  Seriously.  It makes me mad for you.  He just said it needs to own the pussy.  Patrice needs a pocket pussy.  He'd bring the value to zero.  Patrice needs a pocket pussy.  Because I really, it bothers me how little women bring to the table and how many demands  you have.  I don't think we have a lot of demands.  You know what?  How many demands do we have?  I don't know.  Let's read chapter six.  What are the demands?  Here's the hit.  Being gregarious, taking up space and looming. 
[02:45:00]  What's bad?  Being a loud mouth.  I think guys have way more demands.  Hey, we have to look beautiful.  We have to look young.  We have to wear lingerie for you.  We have to be thin.  How many demands do you have?  Fair enough.  You know what that boils down to?  One thing.  Object.  Just be an object.  An object of desire.  Perfect object.  That's what your job is.  So that's a lot more demands.  All we want you guys to do is to shut up.  I want a shiny watch, not a scruffy one.  All we want you to do is not be scruffy.  That's way more demands.  We don't want anything from you.  We don't care if you're bold. 
[02:45:30]  We don't care.  I talk about appearance.  We are not shallow.  We don't care if you don't shave.  We don't have any of those.  We have to shave your legs for you.  We have to look perfect.  We have to dye it for you.  Put makeup.  Wear lingerie.  How many demands is that?  Enunciate.  Okay.  Enunciate.  This is your book.  This is my book.  Oh, good.  Here it is.  Who wants a guy who mumbles?  Top, top ten.  Worst physical.  But here's the thing.  We should, a mumbling guy, because here's the thing.  Even though you're a doctor. 
[02:46:00]  I think you'd want him to mumble if he'd go down on you.  Even though you're a doctor.  I'm just, I'm sharing with you the animal.  Just because you're a doctor doesn't make you any sexier.  You know.  Any sexier as a woman being a doctor.  Oh, you're very wrong.  I'm fine.  Yeah.  Too sold out show.  Sorry about that.  No, go, go.  No.  I just found your perfect woman, by the way.  I want to give you the Adam and Eve, Eve's pussy.  Here you go.  And you can, you can control that completely.  All right.  So.  Fair enough.  AdamEve.com.  This is why we lose. 
[02:46:30]  You fucking talk to her.  And you try to see her tits.  Go ahead.  This is why we fucking lose.  And we should be winning.  This is, give me that.  This is Patrice's name.  That's what Patrice's name is.  Fake pussy.  Fair enough.  That's what we do.  That's what we do.  We don't call him out because we love pussy.  But the fact is, after the pussy, then what?  Then what?  Enough.  All right.  Then what after the pussy?  What are you getting at, Patrice?  Nothing.  No, no.  I'm going to look at fake.  Let me touch this.  I was joking.  It's a quick joke just to lighten the room up a little bit. 
[02:47:00]  It don't mean lighten up.  All right.  All right.  So wait.  After the pussy, then what is, what are you getting at?  After we do our job.  Then you're in hell after that?  No.  After we do our job.  And get the pussy.  And get what we're trying to get initially.  Some of us try to pretend we're looking for love.  But no guy goes out and goes, listen, fellas.  Let's go.  Hey, Thad.  Opie.  Everybody, let's get together because let's all go out and find love.  It doesn't happen.  We go out and search for a certain thing.  That's what we're built to do is hunt for that.  The other thing, if it happens, it happens. 
[02:47:30]  But it shouldn't happen because we get pussy.  I shouldn't.  That's like, you know, it's like going fishing on a fishing boat, right?  All the things you have to do.  You buy the bait.  You go out in the ocean.  You find a perfect spot.  You fish.  You fish.  You catch this big thing on the fucking hook.  You get this giant tuna.  And you're like, holy shit.  Look what I did.  Look what I did.  Then you throw the tuna back in the water.  And then the fucking fish jumps back in the boat.  Yeah, I don't get him at all.  And goes, I love you.  You don't motherfuckers.  It's so funny. 
[02:48:00]  Guys love to pretend they're not looking for love, right?  But you know what statistics show?  Statistics show that men fall in love a lot faster than women do on the first day.  These are statistics on psychological studies.  Men are three times more likely to kill themselves after romantic breakup.  Women get over romantic breakup a lot quicker.  Men live longer in marriages than those who are not.  So statistics show that men are much better off when they're in love. 
[02:48:30]  I think Patrice would say that.  But they go around.  I reject that.  These are statistics.  You cannot reject.  I reject statistics.  You can reject anything you want.  But I'm trying to tell you.  How many people?  What, a hundred studies?  A hundred studies?  Oh, no.  These are studies.  You can't count.  You've got to study.  You've got to study.  Men love to walk around and say, oh, we don't want love.  We don't want love.  But statistics show they do.  Because we get love.  Easy.  Why is that fucking you love me?  I don't know.  It's not so easy.  Why do you think a guy would be more depressed after a breakup than a woman? 
[02:49:00]  Why do you think so?  Exactly.  Why do I think so?  Yeah.  Because women have social networks.  You know what?  They talk to their girlfriends.  They move on a lot faster.  No.  Guys dwell on stuff.  Because a woman can go out that night and have a dick.  And the guy has to search around and maybe at four in the morning, he's fucking drunk  and going home to jerk off because he didn't get anything.  And then the next night, the girl can go out and get another dick.  And the guy, again, has to go out and work his ass off to try to get. 
[02:49:30]  I'm fucking so tired of vaginas.  Why are they three times more?  Why do guys kill each other?  I am so tired of vaginas adding up to your whole life.  Why are they dueling over that?  Anthony, Anthony, you're a famous millionaire.  A famous millionaire.  But a fucking loser could fuck you because she has a pussy.  A fucking loser.  Like a woman who has nothing extra except for vagina can fucking feel like she's at your level. 
[02:50:00]  Do you understand?  You're not at the social status, the thinking status.  You don't have friends.  First of all, women don't have friends with each other.  That's why you want to hang around us all the time because we're better at being friends.  Do you know any information about your friends that could ruin their lives?  Their lives.  No.  Yes, we do.  Really?  As a matter of fact?  You could destroy one of your girlfriend's lives?  Absolutely.  Women talk about guys, about the women talk to each other more than guys do. 
[02:50:30]  Would you hide a gun for your girlfriend if she committed a murder?  Yeah, I would.  She knows that.  See, let me tell you why she's good.  She knows the man.  She knows, in case, I might need my bitch to hide a gun.  Might.  But she knows, she's smart enough to know the guy answer to this.  But you can feel this right here.  She's a little bit annoying with her own life because this is what I'm saying.  And this is what she cut me off on. 
[02:51:00]  I got to agree.  I think more like a guy.  Dr. Z.  Doctor.  I think more like a guy.  I have to admit.  You can't think like a guy.  She's had a hundred dicks.  Just because she's stuck.  She's had a hundred dicks.  She's had a lot.  She's had a lot of dicks.  She's had a lot of dicks.  She has had a lot of dicks.  You've got to give her that.  Let's at least be in agreement that she's had a lot of dicks.  She's had a lot of dicks.  A lot of dicks.  Her having a hundred dicks is as easy as you eating these bag of chips with.  Like it's, it's no big deal.  I understand that.  I agree.  My sister and I had actually a competition who would have more. 
[02:51:30]  More dicks?  What competition is that?  That's a great competition.  Are you guys going to have that again?  A hot dog eating competition.  That's a great competition.  Did you guys have a dick sucking contest?  This is not impressive.  No, no, no.  Not a dick sucking.  What?  That's impressive.  I'm sorry.  It's not impressive.  She's wearing me down now.  You know why it's not impressive?  She said a hundred dicks.  Because she could suck a thousand.  She only sucked a hundred.  But Patrice, you're amazing.  We want to hear about the hundred that she did suck.  She's wearing us down a little bit.  I got to be honest.  Wait, who are you? 
[02:52:00]  Me.  Oh, okay.  A hundred dicks.  You know what?  Because all these sex experts write about techniques from, I wanted to have also a personal  perspective.  Not just a theoretical, but a clinical perspective on things.  How many, uh...  So you did it for science?  A lot.  I did it for science.  I wanted to know what it's like.  I wanted to have the variety.  Wait, I want to...  Empirical approach.  Hold on, I want to say this subtly.  Uh, so you've had hundreds of dicks.  How do I put this?  Um, like how many dicks have you had in your asshole? 
[02:52:30]  You've got to be more straightforward, I think, than that.  No, I'm a lot more selective about that.  That's one of the things you reward your man for special behavior.  Special reinforcement.  More than ten?  This is all bing, bing, bing, buzz.  You reward your man with asshole.  Yeah.  Women make me sick.  Of course.  Are you fucking out your mind?  You know what it is?  It's like shaping an animal.  You reward him.  You reward him.  You're rewarding us with the stink hole.  It's shaping an animal.  It's really coming out now.  That's what it is.  It's shaping an animal.  Thank you.  Hey.  Hey.  Fucking rid of my asshole.  That's how you do it.  You did good. 
[02:53:00]  You took the garbage out all week.  Mow along.  Here's my stink hole.  This attitude is for...  This is for cornballs.  This is for cornballs who are...  Oh my God.  This is for goofy guys.  But this is what guys could do to women.  They can shape them too.  Oh, you got me roses for Valentine's Day.  And that's what I talk about in my book.  Yeah, you shave your balls.  It's fine.  It's fine to shave your balls.  But we're talking about why your asshole's a prize.  Yeah, we...  I don't look at it as a prize.  I look at it as maybe...  That's not a prize.  It's kind of a prize.  I recently had it. 
[02:53:30]  I look at it as variety.  It's not a prize.  Women have three holes.  I recently had it.  I thought it was a bit of a prize.  I felt like I had won something.  It's a prize.  Why is that mouth and pussy hole different from the asshole?  The lower intestine was different.  It's just another hole to shove your knuckle in.  It's just complete...  You're a bunch of holes.  That's what women are.  Just three holes.  Well, and I...  Three holes.  Basically, that's what it is.  Is that in the book, how to get women, just saying you're a bunch of holes?  Yeah.  Oh, well, no.  But I do.  I do talk in the book about how to get anal and why and how most women actually... 
[02:54:00]  All right.  How do you get anal?  How do you get anal?  Most women love it.  Most women love it.  I'm going to control this a little bit or at least attempt to.  How does one get yours or another woman's asshole?  And if we can come back to the fucking competition with your sister.  Do you do that later?  But first...  Yeah.  TJ and I are on the same page.  Sure, sure.  So how do you get asshole?  Subtle psychological techniques to get asshole.  We killed Patrice.  Jedi mind tricks.  Hold on, Patrice.  Let her talk for 30 seconds. 
[02:54:30]  I'm just shutting the fuck up.  Let me fuck you in the ass.  I get serious about this fucking shit.  It's just...  All right, hold on.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Let her finish her fault.  No problem.  No problem.  Give me 40 seconds.  I swear...  More than that.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Let me just say...  How do you get the asshole?  Patrice saying let me fuck you in the ass is not going to get him in the ass.  Whatever.  I like shutting the fuck up.  And I'm wondering how much...  I'm wondering how much he's actually got.  How much ass he's actually got.  I'm wondering how much ass he's actually gotten in his lifetime.  Oh, you...  I'm really... 
[02:55:00]  You're talking to the wrong guy.  I'm really wondering.  Patrice is the man.  And the kind of ass.  He's eating potatoes now.  It's also about the quality.  Patrice is not about the quantity.  Patrice is the king of Scotland when it comes to pussy.  Oh, yeah.  How do you get the asshole, though?  So you got to go baby steps?  Yeah, exactly.  You got to fight back here.  I'm trying to help you out.  How do you get the asshole?  I don't feel...  I don't look at it as a fight.  I don't see what I'm fighting against.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm just...  Yeah.  This is not impressing me.  Because women don't need to.  Wait.  They could just say, here's what you need to have an asshole.  And a lot of guys want to get the asshole this weekend. 
[02:55:30]  What do we do?  If a guy...  Okay, let's say a guy has just his weekend...  Because you talk a lot about doing this quickly, right?  That's a big part of the book, getting done quickly.  Well, no, no.  Not necessarily quickly.  Yeah, something you're not going to get quickly.  Unless this is the woman who gives up ass to everyone.  And I don't think you want that kind of woman.  But if you just had two days.  The one that fucking fucks a hundred guys.  Yeah, that kind of woman.  This is...  But it's not on her.  Patrice?  All fucking women of this fucking hypocritical...  Patrice, let her finish.  Those dirty...  Those dirty asshole bitches. 
[02:56:00]  I really want to know.  People are taking notes out there.  Sorry, go ahead.  All right.  And people...  All right.  No one who's getting any ass this weekend.  They're just going to have...  When they have sex, they're going to have your voice in the back of their head.  Patrice is going to have a matter ofism.  Before we find out how to get asshole.  That pussy is value to zero.  Right.  Nothing.  How do we get asshole?  Well, you know what?  Patrice is not helping.  He's getting guys less, less pussy rather than more.  Yeah, but of course...  Because this kind of approach is going to turn women off.  But that's what they...  There's a million of you.  This is for angry guys.  You fucked a hundred guys. 
[02:56:30]  Did they all do the same thing to get you?  They were all...  You didn't fuck some guys on the first night?  The first day you met them?  They all had to qualify.  Of course.  Exactly.  They all had to qualify.  They had to offer...  They had to imply all their hard work to get your twat.  No.  Not at all.  But yes, they did.  Yes, they did.  But they had to offer me some value, some interest.  Of course.  Something.  They didn't come up to me and say, let me fuck you.  Of course not.  But what did they do?  Dinner?  Movie?  Oh, boy.  We're not going to find out about this.  No, not necessarily that.  I mean, I am just wanting to hear... 
[02:57:00]  Sorry.  I'm going to just need to know...  Let me...  I've been waiting all weekend.  We've got...  I enjoy the Patrice angle.  You know, Patrice...  I'm listening...  All right, just listen for a minute.  You're losing your mind.  So I don't have to fucking cut people...  But this is what shit?  This is more vaginal horse...  Well, let me listen to you.  No, no.  I want to hear Patrice's approach.  No, no.  I want to hear his approach.  No, talk us through...  What is his recommendation for scoring with women?  Well, you get us, asshole.  Now, I've got to say tips. 
[02:57:30]  Because right now, all he gave us is how not to get any pussy, and why pussy means nothing.  I want to know his approach.  What is his advice to a guy to score with a woman?  Here is a woman in a bar.  How do you score with her?  I want to know.  I don't have any advice on how pick up women.  Oh, exactly.  You don't have advice.  All you have is just angry bitch and complain.  We'll go back to the S-B-E.  It's just angry bullshit.  That's all it is.  There you go.  That's the real shit.  There I go.  There you go.  I like that.  That's what I want. 
[02:58:00]  The real shit.  Yeah, it's just angry fuck.  Your emotional horse shit.  That's what you want.  Where is that emotional?  You are in your vagina.  I am very calm.  You are getting emotional.  Because I take it very seriously.  You just don't want to get emotional.  You qualified your shithole.  Women that give up their shithole is less better than you because all you do is fuck a hundred  guys with your pussy.  But you're very careful with the shithole. 
[02:58:30]  The shithole is less important.  You know how you get the asshole?  You eat the pussy, lick the asshole, and it feels good.  Then you put a finger in it.  And then the bitch wants to do something.  You want to know how you pee on your girl?  In the shower.  You want to know how to get her to suck your dick?  Slap her in the face with it.  This is what's wrong with you.  You direct too many of your movies.  Open up.  That's what the fuck you do.  All right, well, I guess we...  What the fuck you don't know?  You're the fucky.  How you gonna tell me how to fuck you?  We actually... 
[02:59:00]  You get fucked.  We have the...  So the question has been answered, Dr. Zayn.  Thank you for coming in today.  Dr. Zayn, do you agree with Patrice's approach on the asshole?  You are the fucky.  Patrice's book is considerably shorter than yours.  Uh, yeah.  Patrice's a pamphlet.  It's more of a pamphlet.  Right.  Yeah, I would see that.  Would you agree with that as far as how to get the asshole?  No.  No?  Well, how do you get the asshole?  Well, then you'll just have to read my book.  No, no, no.  Don't cop out.  What chapter?  Don't cop out with that, Dr. Zayn.  Well, why don't...  You know...  Let's see what's... 
[02:59:30]  How to get the asshole.  Okay, here's what I want to know.  So while he's reading, I think we've got about 20 seconds before he starts yelling at you  again.  Yeah, talking about emotional.  Yeah, I get emotional because when do guys get to be?  When do we get to be fucking emotional?  We want you to be emotional.  We want you to express.  About how much losers you guys are.  You are fucking losers.  Trying to make a...  Here's what you're trying to do.  Have a man and have a woman at the fucking same time.  We're men.  We're better than you.  We want a guy. 
[03:00:00]  We don't want a woman.  We don't want a wussy guy.  Yeah.  We don't want that.  A non-wussy guy is better than you.  If you had two days to have anal sex, how would you do that?  Oh, very good.  Can you do it?  Thank you.  Can you do it in about 20 seconds before Patrice goes back into...  Yeah, you got 20 seconds to get us an asshole this weekend.  Anyway, because you said you talk about doing things quickly in the book.  You're going to have to do it quickly on this show.  Yeah.  How do you do it?  I'm asking you.  It has to do with conditioning.  So basically, you have to condition things that she likes, and most women like clitoral 
[03:00:30]  stimulation, with anal stimulation.  So what you do is you pair.  It's a Pavlovian conditioning.  You pair one response with the other.  So you give them some food when you're licking their clit.  Is that right?  No.  Ring the bell.  They salivate.  You shove your dick in their mouth.  There it is.  Come on.  Pavlov's dog.  Here it comes.  Get some peanut butter.  You go down on her while stimulating her, and you pair.  The two responses.  You pair them together?  Yeah. 
[03:01:00]  And some of the things that you like.  You condition her to know that she doesn't really have a choice in what you like sexually.  Do you understand?  It trickles down from you.  They don't know.  The only thing they know.  So you're saying you can get a woman to do anything you want.  Anything.  You don't negotiate with them.  If you tell them.  So this is actually interesting, because it sounds like you guys are saying the same thing.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying, too.  Patrice is a little.  I think you're on the same page.  Oh, but.  Yeah, Patrice.  Right there.  I see.  Of course.  Go ahead.  You're sticking your dick in the first time you meet her. 
[03:01:30]  I didn't say that.  But why shouldn't you fuck her in the ass the first time, as opposed to the pussy the  first time?  What's the...  I don't get it.  Good question, doctor.  Why?  Because most women are defensive about that.  And most women are uncomfortable.  And you know why most women?  Even because you make up your own movie that stars you as you, stars you as me, stars you  as the director, you're the producer.  No.  Stop doing...  They don't know what they like.  Anytime you fuck a girl...  Most women...  Anytime you fuck a girl and she tells you what she likes, that means she likes it because 
[03:02:00]  some other dude did it.  And she goes, oh, I like that.  But you don't have an explorative mind where you go, you know what?  I wonder what it's like.  If it wasn't for the fact a guy tried to fuck you in your ass, you wouldn't go, boy, I want  to get fucked in my ass.  We bring everything to you.  Your whole idea is based on you want to be a man, you think you think like a man?  Because thinking like a woman is so fucking awful.  That's why you think like a man. 
[03:02:30]  So why...  You would never answer my question.  Why a majority of transvestites and transsexual...  Your question, how about the 17 questions you didn't fucking answer?  You didn't even ask me any questions.  This is a monologue.  10 hours they've been asking you how to fuck a girl and a half.  Monologue.  This is not a dialogue.  A little bit, a little bit.  This is a monologue.  I'm just listening.  Very, very fair.  Let me for Dr. Z.  Transvestites aren't indicative of all men.  You're absolutely right, Dr. Z.  That's a very small monologue.  And let me shut the fuck up.  I'm going to smack myself to tell me shut the fuck up. 
[03:03:00]  It's like the Cavaliers playing the Bobcats.  You bring up this transvestite thing.  I'm sorry.  I'm very sorry.  You bring up the transvestite thing.  He's saying that women don't want to be women, that it sucks being women, that it's so great  to be a guy.  So I'm asking you why then all of the 99% of hundreds of thousands transsexuals and transvestites  are male to female.  It's guys who want to wear women's clothing, guys who want to make up, guys who want to  submit to mistresses and dominatrix. 
[03:03:30]  It's all about guys wanting to be women.  The majority are guys.  It's a huge percentage.  That's like saying 99% of retarded people can't fucking figure out math.  No, no.  But I'm trying to say, why there are no transsexuals who want to be men?  I'm trying to shut the fuck up, but he just made a point that you completely didn't acknowledge.  He just made a very logical analogy.  That's a higher percentage than you would think, a very high percentage. 
[03:04:00]  No, what he's saying is who gives a fuck what guy wants to be a transvestite.  Why?  We're talking about guys who are fucking guys who want to fuck women.  Why?  Because you're saying to me that it sucks being a woman and that all women want to be guys,  that women hate being women.  I agree with Patrice.  You said at one point, you said guys dress up like women because they want to control that  thing.  No, they don't want to control that.  They want to be that.  They don't want to control anything.  They want to be, they want to get rid of their dick. 
[03:04:30]  They want to become women.  They want to dress up.  They want to be pretty.  They want to be cute little girls.  And they want to be the fucky.  Because it's in power.  Yeah.  But they're crazy.  Why do they want to?  But we're talking about regular dudes.  Can I jump in here?  Oh, that is.  Yeah, sorry.  Dr. Z, how do we get ass to mouth going?  A little ass to mouth this weekend.  That is a question that I've asked myself.  Yeah, it's on a lot, right?  It's on a lot.  Have some wipes so you can wipe it off after you pull it out of the ass. 
[03:05:00]  It might be good in a porno, but you don't want that.  You know what E. coli is?  Not logical when it comes to regular relationships.  And you know what?  It's not only in logical.  That's not marriage material.  It causes a bad stomachache.  Bad stomachache.  Yeah, you're going to get a stomachache.  Yeah, E. coli, guys.  E. coli.  Ass to mouth will give you a bad stomach.  Okay, now, is there any way we can come back to the competition you had with your sister?  Back on back?  Yeah, yeah.  Who won, by the way?  What do you want to know?  Yeah, first of all, who won? 
[03:05:30]  That's an important part of it.  She did.  This was back in the USSR and the crazy years.  I think in the way all the men won.  Also, how many guys?  Sure, yeah.  Yeah.  How many more guys did she have intercourse with in you?  I think we, you know, after a while it just became, you know, we switched off to something  else.  It just became boring.  It's just, of course it wouldn't be.  I think about, she probably won by about ten.  By the way, a lot of girls do want to be men as well. 
[03:06:00]  But it's just tough to like put a dick on women.  No, it's not tough.  It's actually just surgically, it's actually not that much tougher.  Well, they're getting there.  But it's easier to lop one off than actually build one.  You'd be surprised.  Look at the lesbians out there.  They're very manly.  Yeah.  Extremely manly.  But they don't want to be necessarily be man.  I'm not talking the homosexuals.  I'm talking transsexuals.  I'm talking the gender dysphoria.  Gender dysphoria is much higher in males than females.  Right.  In the psychology.  And these are facts you can't ignore. 
[03:06:30]  I'll tell you why I'm mad.  Yeah, why are you mad, Patrice?  I am mad.  I'm just mad and not at her.  Or it's just like you figure somebody with doctor in front of their name, right, would  just be saying something you haven't heard from the average bitch that works at McDonald's.  Like they just, you're just saying the same horse shit.  I'm going to the bathroom.  It's like, it's just, it's like, you know, to ask, hey, how do you do ass to mouth?  It's the same as how do you fuck her?  You know what I mean?  It's like, once you figure out the control of how to talk a woman out of being like their 
[03:07:00]  typical horse shit, it's just getting around their typical bullshit because they don't  have a filter.  They don't, they go from how they feel to coming out their fucking mouth.  They never explore how to have an option on how to think.  She believes that just because she thinks she thinks like a guy, that makes her a guy.  Like, no.  Like when I was getting ready to say doctor, do you realize the fact that you're a doctor  doesn't make you more attractive than if you fucking was the woman garbage man. 
[03:07:30]  No, it does make me more attractive.  It doesn't.  It doesn't make you more attractive to you.  I'm telling you it doesn't.  Because you are into skanky women who are not doctors, but there's plenty of guys to  whom it does make me more attractive.  I'll give you an example that Patrice brought up.  I'll give you an example of a point he brought up.  You take a plumber, just a guy, he's a plumber, average looking guy.  He walks up and he tries to get into, I don't know, some Hollywood starlet's pants at some 
[03:08:00]  party.  He's lucky enough to somehow get his way in there.  He's not getting near her.  If he talks to her for two seconds, he's being driven away.  It's just, it ain't gonna work.  You put the shoe on the other foot where some girl comes in, attractive looking, doesn't  have to be the best looking girl in the world, can absolutely hook up with a rock star or  George Clooney or any other guy because for no other reason than she has a vagina that 
[03:08:30]  the guy wants to get into.  That's not true.  And then she's hot.  What's a Halle Berry ends up with this movie star?  I mean, a movie star Halle Berry ends up with some, with some, with some model, some guy  who's nobody but has a cute face.  A model, though.  He's a model.  He's not a fucking model.  He's not a guy that makes money for me.  But do you think male, do you think George Clooney's gonna hook up with just any girl?  He's gonna hook up with a hot girl.  He's gonna fuck her? 
[03:09:00]  He's gonna fuck her.  Yeah, a hot girl, right.  You just answered me.  Well, it's the same way the other way around.  But it doesn't matter.  Halle Berry's gonna fuck a guy because he's a model.  Hold on, hold on.  He has nothing else to offer to her.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on.  The model or the hot girl that George Clooney hooks up with can be a fucking receptionist  at a haircutting salon.  You think it doesn't work the other way around?  The hot guy that Halle Berry hooks up with, he ain't gonna be no fucking guy that works  for the telephone company.  This is gonna be a model guy, some fucking director, producer, or some shit. 
[03:09:30]  People come all the time with just looking guys or nobody.  Because the guy needs to have something, and the girl needs to have a pussy.  That's Patrice's point.  Why won't you just admit that, though?  You do have to back that up.  I mean, I talked to, there's a guy who's in the office, and, you know, like, not a terribly  attractive guy.  You know, he was an out-of-work actor for a very long time.  He said the second that he got on television, as soon as he got on television, he goes,  it evened the playing field. 
[03:10:00]  I would walk into a room, and it was like being a hot girl.  All of a sudden, girls were talking.  So what's your point?  What's the point?  The point is, the point is, the guys...  We're less shallow.  We're looking for qualities other than your looks.  You guys only care about, look, you don't care how dumb a woman is.  You don't care if she's, like, a complete...  There you go.  This is the real world point.  This is girl coming out.  That makes you a shallow guy.  This bullshit, this bullshit Dr. Z is disappearing, baby.  Good job, TJ.  No, that's true. 
[03:10:30]  Now we're going to come on.  Now Victoria Sordak is coming the fuck out, baby.  Now, you're not, you're interested in it.  But that's exactly the point.  Good job, TJ.  Good job.  Anthony just said what's true, which is that a guy needs to have external things about him.  He needs to have other things to level the playing field.  Right.  All a girl has to do is be attractive.  Now, if a guy...  But what is the...  Why won't a girl go out with a guy who works at the telephone company and is, like, kind  of good-looking...  They go out all the time. 
[03:11:00]  All the time.  Do you want me to give you names?  I'll give you names of women.  I used to work at Radio Shack.  I'll give you some names.  I'll give you...  Can I just please...  I'll give you...  Wait a second.  I'm trying...  No more of all.  You've been...  Lowball insults.  That's all you've been doing.  Fair enough.  This is what I'm talking about.  No, no.  This is the real boiling down for me and girl.  I'm going to give you names of women who ended up with...  I'm going to fucking let you talk all... 
[03:11:30]  I just want to say this one thing about your book.  Just on this point.  This is an entire book on what a guy should do to get pussy.  Right.  Not to have a life...  Not to have a life with her.  Not to understand anything about all this shit to get...  You are...  Because guys don't care about getting a life.  They care about getting pussy.  That's your point right there.  This is why you're trying to control your...  They don't want a book on a relationship. 
[03:12:00]  But this...  But here's what your book does.  I'm not controlling anything.  I'm giving guys...  Here's what this book does.  I'm giving guys quick tips.  This book makes guys act a certain way so that when you finally give up the pussy, he might  have an emotional investment in you.  This book has nothing to do with emotional investment.  It has emotional investing qualities.  That's exactly what...  No.  What are you talking about?  Why don't you just write a book called Ladies, Give Up Your Pussy and Stop Playing.  That's your book.  This is the book you need to write, Ladies, Give Up Your Pussy. 
[03:12:30]  But why wouldn't you...  If you have a male point of view, why wouldn't you just write it for women?  Because I don't write books for women.  I don't want to write books for women.  But you're writing books for men that have nothing to do with how the fuck we feel.  But it's...  But you don't...  Why should I write about how you feel?  Exactly.  You want to get hot women?  I give you a formula to get hot women.  A formula.  You want to know...  A 7,000 page book when it shouldn't even be.  I think I can explain what Patrice was saying. 
[03:13:00]  It's more difficult...  He's trying to get me to write books for women.  Yeah, yeah, but...  I don't write books for women.  But you could...  He needs to write a book for women.  That's what I'm going to do.  You could because it's easy.  What you're saying is, take a car on a road.  And you want to get the car down the road.  So your version of this book is the equivalent of moving the road under the car.  No.  Not at all.  And Patrice's idea is, you turn the car on and drive it down the fucking road.  It's a lot easier for you to say, women, just give up the pussy.  So basically, you want me to tell all those women out there, just give it up. 
[03:13:30]  Just fuck.  Just give it up.  Right.  And you might come out of it happy in the end if you stop qualifying how important you are...  But guess what?  ...to your vagina.  I'm here to sell the books.  And women are not going to buy the book, give up the vagina.  They don't want to give up their vagina.  It serves no evolutionary purpose for them to give up the vagina.  It's evolutionary purpose.  And we're evolutionary.  We are the human animal.  Let me tell you how behind...  That's a hot button word for Patrice.  Let me tell you how behind you guys are.  In the year one, or whenever you found out pussy was valuable, and you found out some guy would give his rocks up... 
[03:14:00]  You know how long ago?  ...for your vagina.  About millions of years ago.  A million years ago.  And I say men are behind the pussy a million years.  But we are evolving because we're tired of giving up everything we work for for twat.  So you're basically staying the same as you were in the year 07 or whatever.  So how are you evolving?  We're evolving by understanding that all your demands that you have as women, all the things you want, you're not going to get it. 
[03:14:30]  You know, it's very simple.  You have to earn what you want.  It boils down to two things.  Eggs are rare.  There's not that many of them.  Sperm is plenty.  Therefore, you've got something that there's lots of.  We've got something that's rare.  You want your jeans passed on, you've got to play the dance.  That's how it works.  That's not true.  We are the carriers of the jeans.  It's absolutely not true.  Yes, that's how it is.  Well, no, scientifically it's true, but how you're making it... 
[03:15:00]  You're not going to change anything.  But you're not special because you're a girl.  You're not special because you can have babies.  You're not special.  We just happen to be the dudes that shoot it out.  You happen to be the receivers.  Like, you're not a special person because nature said that you have babies.  You're not special.  It's just nature.  You're missing the point.  You're missing the point.  Guys want to pass on as many of their jeans as possible.  We want to be selective.  And that's how it works.  It's always going to be.  We've got something you want. 
[03:15:30]  We can pass on your jeans.  Without us, you cannot pass on your jeans.  When you was fucking all these guys, it was all pleasure.  And so you kind of went against nature.  I'm a little different from most women.  I see.  I don't agree that you are.  No, because look at all these angry sips of water.  I like her now.  I like Dr. Z now.  She's getting out on her horse shit.  I really like it.  I really like the fact that she, like, the dig she's saying I'm giving, she was giving. 
[03:16:00]  Like, oh, you like to fuck scuds bags.  Yeah, but I fuck doctors too.  They're just as fucking dumb as every other girl.  I've met dumb garbage girls and I've met dumb doctors when it comes to this game.  You can't win it.  Because you have no skill to get what you want.  We have the skill to get pussy.  We don't need this book.  What is your skill?  We'll give guys a specific skill.  We also have to have the skill.  What is the skill?  I want to know the skill.  The skill is all, whatever you've done over, like, he has different skill, I have different, 
[03:16:30]  I don't have a how to pick up.  You have a skill.  I got to give you.  You got the gift of gab.  But there's a lot of guys out there who don't have the skill.  Exactly.  And my book gives them the skill.  No, they don't.  Your book teaches them how, lookit, a fucking retard with a job.  This is what makes guys different than women get attracted to other things.  Your downfall is that you're not as shallow as us.  So a retarded guy can go, a retarded millionaire can go, listen, you know what?  I want a million dollars, but he can get pussy. 
[03:17:00]  A retarded billionaire woman is in deep shit.  That is the book that I want to read.  The retarded millionaire's way to get pussy.  I like the retarded billionaire woman is in deep shit.  Let me tell you, if you've got money, you're going to get pussy or dick.  Just look at all these, you know, look at Ivana Trump.  She's like hanging out with these hot, hot male models. 
[03:17:30]  And, you know, it doesn't matter.  If you've got money, you can get laid.  So that's not an issue.  We're not talking about money.  Ivana Trump doesn't have to pay to get dick.  But I'm trying to tell you that it doesn't matter.  If you've got money, you're going to get laid.  It doesn't matter what gender you are.  Have you struggled ever to get dick?  Have you struggled to get dick?  No.  Man, so what do you know?  Have you struggled to get pussy?  Of course.  I'm a fat motherfucker.  I had to learn how to get pussy.  I had to talk.  I had to learn.  So tell the guys right now, give them concrete advice. 
[03:18:00]  There is none.  Regular guys who don't have the humor that you have, who don't have the gift of gab,  give them concrete advice.  They don't need as much as, put it this way.  Do you have satisfaction when you're, like, how did the dick,  become such a lesser value than the vagina?  By the way, TJ's mother is there.  I told you how it became.  Hi, mommy.  How are you, man?  It's very simple.  We're just talking about dick and how to get pussy.  It's not the dick.  The pussy has no value.  We'll talk about it.  It's not the dick.  She's hard enough.  We'll talk about it at lunch. 
[03:18:30]  His mother's like my mother, like, my baby's in a movie.  I don't care.  I don't care.  She's just waving.  And in her mind, she's like, what the fuck did I do wrong here?  What happened?  Hey, honey.  Why does he have friends like these?  It's not dick versus pussy.  It's sperm versus eggs.  And there's finite numbers.  But it's not, though, because I'll be happy putting it on you as well as in you.  Right.  Right.  I know that.  But deep inside your mind, the reason you want to put it out there is because...  How come Opie's asking the questions I want to hear answers to? 
[03:19:00]  It's because you want your genes passed on.  Whether you want to deny it or not, you want your genes passed on, right?  And therefore, you're out there looking for these receptacles to pass on your genes.  Ooh, receptacles.  I like that.  I like receptacles.  We can only pass on...  Sock, cup, floor, or woman.  That's actually my mom told me that.  She did.  She said that one time.  Early on.  They're receptacles. 
[03:19:30]  I got a legitimate question.  Okay.  How do you get a girl to take it on the face?  Doctor, comment?  Because a lot of women...  Stay away from the eyes.  Yeah.  No, but a lot of women, you could put it just about anywhere, but you get up near the...  Even, like, the neck.  This is, like...  It's the same thing with...  It's the same thing with...  It's the same thing with...  The neck up is the fly zone.  It gets in the eyes.  Now, it's not horny to come on my stomach, but face is disrespectful.  Right.  How do we get a...  It's disrespectful.  It messes up your makeup.  And some women think it makes them break out. 
[03:20:00]  What about on your forehead?  Seriously.  Wait, it's a breakout thing?  Some women think it makes you break out.  I thought it was a respect thing.  How about the nape of your neck?  This is what I'm saying.  It's just...  No fly zone.  It's just...  It's just...  This argument...  And it stings when it gets in the eyes.  It really fucking stings.  Yeah.  So that's why they say the respect.  It's brand new.  I'm going to keep it away from me.  God, I'm going to read this whole book.  I'm going to call it Dr. Z.  She's on her fifth bottle of water.  I love water.  What is good for her?  I'm drinking all day long.  What's it is?  I like this.  I like Victoria.  Let me know that Dr. Z is hanging in there.  You're doing very good.  I like Victoria. 
[03:20:30]  I'm just listening.  I want to manage the Patrice and Dr. Z sex show.  Oh, can I call you Vicky?  It would be the greatest radio show ever to be on.  Oh, yeah.  Patrice would be on his feet.  And let me tell you something.  She has a man, but this is exactly...  I could fuck her so easy based on the fact that she fucking hates my guts.  That's all it is.  I don't hate you at all.  I actually find you very entertaining.  You know what?  Like a big bear.  No.  I actually went...  Why would you do it right there?  And you know what?  I can't even begin to imagine what sex is. 
[03:21:00]  That's what it looks like.  You have blonde hair.  Yeah.  You only want to fuck me because I'm hot, right?  I actually would like to...  You're not bad.  That would be the definition of hate fucking.  I like to fuck guys who are quick with it and who have a good sense of humor.  You're not bad.  And let me explain to you what you are.  And this is not an insult.  Because this is a thing we apply.  Because a guy like me, a guy that's not a fucking model, good looking dude.  Sure.  Okay.  The guy doesn't have to be model. 
[03:21:30]  We usually go one to ten when guys are going, hey, explaining the hot girl.  Right.  One to ten.  What you give her, man?  Ooh, she's like a nine.  She's a...  In real life, you're a ten.  But we went up to 30.  Okay?  Me and my friends went up from one to 30.  Okay.  And what we did is break that 30 down into three categories of ten.  The first ten is ugly bitches.  The second ten is okay looking bitches.  Ah.  And the third ten is beautiful bitches.  So a number 20 is either a beautiful okay looking woman or an ugly fine woman. 
[03:22:00]  A ten is a gorgeous, ugly woman.  An 11 is a ugly, okay looking woman.  What's Dr. Z?  I love this scale.  Dr. Z is a 21.  To me.  She's an ugly, beautiful woman.  She is as gorgeous of an okay woman as you can get.  But the reason you do this is not to insult a woman. 
[03:22:30]  It's to know how much confidence to have.  True.  Like, I don't have 30 confidence, but I know I can get a 22.  Mother, you're a 30 in my book.  I want you to know that.  Yeah.  I think TJ's mom is beautiful.  She's wonderful.  Uma Thurman is a ten.  I give her 25.  She's a beautiful ugly girl.  She's a beautiful ugly girl.  You know, actually, it's funny.  I love this scale.  Because if you read my book, I have this whole thing on demystifying beauty.  Because guys go gag over beauty.  And that's exactly what I tell them. 
[03:23:00]  Tell yourself beauty's common.  Beauty's out there.  You know what?  Beauty's diamond doesn't.  I want something more substance than just beauty.  And if you talk to yourself like that, you can actually demystify beauty and have the power to come up to any woman.  Because, you know what?  Guys are...  Not any woman, though.  Depending on, really, on...  Because you might not have the confidence.  Because what that does is give confidence.  It's like, if you look at a woman and go, eh, she's a 15.  Exactly.  But that's exactly what, by the way, I talk to her like a 15.  But the 30, you might have trouble talking to her. 
[03:23:30]  The 30.  Are you all about the big cock?  No.  At all.  And actually, if you read my book, if I read my book...  As long as those questions get out there.  I have a whole chapter on my size does not matter, guys.  So what does not matter?  You know what it is?  But no one cares.  I still want a baby arm, Jack.  I want a fucking pole of death.  An unattractive plumber who has a small penis, if he reads your book, he can approach a perfect  what?  A 20?  A 25?  22.  30.  22.  A 12. 
[03:24:00]  A 12.  And can score with her.  Forget about these numbers.  The numbers are now very important.  Because you know what?  You know, guys, it's too much.  A 12 is an ugly, alright-looking woman.  Look, stop.  They're just women.  They're just women.  Who cares?  Imagine what she's going to look like in 50 years.  She's not going to be a 10.  If you have that in your mind, you can approach anyone.  So all you have to do is just think, I can have sex with her in 15 years.  The size of the dick has nothing to do with it.  I just gave away a size queen, though.  Yeah.  What about size queens?  They're out there.  Yeah.  Big dicks.  Big dicks.  Big dicks.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:24:30]  There are big dicks girls just like there are big...  My girls won.  There are big...  There are guys who are into big-ass tits.  Who are into those ridiculous tits, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There are guys that are into small tits.  Exactly.  Are there girls that are into small dicks?  Yes.  Yes, there are.  But that's a bad analogy because you're not stuffing a titty in my asshole or...  It's the same thing.  You're not filling up anything.  Which is also an image I did not expect to have in my mind today.  It's Patrice O'Neal stuffing a titty in his ass.  There is guys who love big clits.  Should we send your mom to breakfast, TJ? 
[03:25:00]  There's guys who don't like big clits, right?  I mean...  She's all right.  She's waving.  She's cool.  Yeah, I know.  Her only response is just waving.  Now she's like turning to somebody else and being like, I hear it all the time.  I'm at home.  Let's go.  Hey, is Lily here from Ranafez, noon to three?  I saw her peeking her head in.  I mean, I think Dr. Z needs some backup here.  Need a little backup.  Women are ridiculous.  Lily, does size matter on a guy?  Go to that mic, please.  Lily, we're talking about size and if there's...  Size queens and stuff.  Big dicks. 
[03:25:30]  Is there a small dick girl?  Is there a girl that likes small dicks?  I would say she'd be lying.  What?  Size doesn't matter.  Unless a guy has a micropenis.  No, I think size does matter.  No, Lily's saying size does matter.  Average is more than enough for women.  Average is completely fine.  Actually, most women that I interviewed don't like a big dick.  It's like, okay, it's nice.  Interesting to look at, but put it away.  Put it away.  Lily's over there.  I'm right here.  And she says that she wants a big dick.  She needs big dick.  What's bigger?  I mean, it doesn't have to be huge.  What's big?  What's big?  I'd say like eight, nine. 
[03:26:00]  Jesus.  So it's not going to be like two women.  She's like, you know, eight, nine.  When I'm finger-fucking my girl and she's going, ah, ah.  TJ, can we ask your mom the same question or is that your fault?  I mean, at least it's up to her.  Now let me tell you, the guys with big dicks, the guy with big dick is going to have a hard  time talking a girl into their anal.  If she's average or smaller, it's much more likely to-  She wants to be pink sock.  Would you take a big one in the poop chute or what?  Are you going to do that?  I'm not the person to ask.  I'm not into that. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah, she doesn't like the poop chute.  That's another thing that women say.  That is one good thing for all the listeners that have small dicks.  Women don't get to say they're not into anything.  Oh, if it was up to women by themselves, they would just be into-  You know what?  What they're into.  Forget about the dick size.  Forget about that.  They're not into ass-fucking because somebody hasn't made them into ass-fucking yet.  You know, it's like, I'm not into that.  It's like, you shouldn't even say that as a woman, what you're not into.  Because how many things do you do now, sexually, that you started off saying, I would never 
[03:27:00]  do that, and now you do it with autonomy?  I would say none.  So you just have sex in the vagina and that's it?  You don't give head?  Oh, no, I do.  So have you ever in your life went, ew, I'm not going to suck a dick?  No, never.  Have you ever licked an asshole?  Yeah.  And you've never said to yourself ever, I would never lick a man's asshole?  Come on, stop.  If you're being honest, be honest.  You said, ooh, give me some man's asshole.  Honest to God, there's not much that grosses me out.  But I'm saying, in the beginning, before you became an ass-licker, did- 
[03:27:30]  And now I'm an ass-licker.  Why?  You lick one ass.  Didn't you say that before you licked an asshole, that you would never do that when asked  or when you thought about it?  I can't honestly remember.  This is why we win.  This is why we fucking win.  Probably you didn't.  You know, but see, Patrice, your premise is that women don't want to do these things,  okay?  Women do want to do this.  You know what?  The whole thing with men is that men, for some reason, think that women don't want sex. 
[03:28:00]  Women want sex, but it has to be sex worth having.  You know what?  If I'm going to shave my pussy, shave my legs, get ready, and then you're going to come  in four minutes, which is the average for American male.  It's not worth it for me, okay?  So learn to laugh.  What about you laying there like a fucking mummy?  What about the fact that you won't fucking lick my balls?  What about the fact that you won't let me spit in your face?  You would lick your balls, Patrice.  Relax.  But no, I'm not talking about me.  I'm talking about the fact that the average American male comes in under four minutes. 
[03:28:30]  Who gives a fuck?  Is that sex worth having for most women?  I did a survey.  The average American woman lay there like a fucking lump and won't spit on your balls.  And that survey was 99.8%.  TJ, your mom's nodding to that, by the way.  She's nodding to that fact.  So it's women.  I did a survey.  But what I'm saying is that if men put in a little more effort, women put in a little  More importantly, Lily, is the bet still a collectible on? 
[03:29:00]  Yeah, Lily's supposed to sleep over.  I mean, we may have to renegotiate this year.  I know it.  Lily, do you have a splooge no-fly zone?  No.  Oh, the eye.  Just the eye.  Just the eye.  I say everything's very gay but the eye.  But your goal face.  Yeah, sure.  Just not the eye.  Do you think that allowing that boundary to be crossed is something that you offer up  as a prize to the men that you sleep with?  I mean, it's the eye.  I don't know how turned on men get by shooting a load in the eye.  The shit stings.  The shit stings.  Any place that's degrading, guys like to shoot. 
[03:29:30]  Any place that just makes you.  Yeah, where you go, oh, look at this piece of filth right here.  And especially in the nose.  If you got to make a chick blow sperm out of her left nostril, makes you fucking enjoy.  Then why do you think we like gagging and ass fucking?  Ass fucking brings nothing to life except for, ooh, it's in the ass.  That's all it is.  That's quite enjoyable.  A lot of women love it.  CJ, don't turn around.  Your mom's sitting up straight.  She's really paying attention now.  I can't.  You know, this is the one day that I'm like, yeah, come and see. 
[03:30:00]  I'm on a radio show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Now let me ask you this.  She's got two things.  She's got a huge black guy yelling at a doctor.  Since you've been asking me all these questions, let me ask some questions.  Oh, wow.  Look at you taking control.  I like this.  Fair enough.  Do you like it when a woman sticks fingers up your ass?  No.  See, now you're like, oh, I'm not like that.  I'm not a homer.  But guess what?  But I do like when she licks it, though.  I do like when she licks it.  Majority of guys love it. 
[03:30:30]  Majority of guys.  Majority.  Majority love prostate massage.  I bet it does.  But now you're like, oh, I'm too much of a guy.  I would never have a homer.  No, I didn't say that.  Because that would make me as a homer.  I said it because I tried it.  And here's what it is.  Women don't do it.  You do nothing with a legitimate passion.  Now he's backtracking.  No, no, no, no.  When women finger you, it's always some way of making you a fag.  Like if a girl.  No, no, no. 
[03:31:00]  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  It's nothing to do with that.  It's nothing to do with being a fag.  Patrice is onto something.  Vicky, can I?  May I say this?  It's a thing where, like, okay.  I don't like a girl to suck my dick.  I like a dick sucker.  Let me explain that.  Meaning, I don't like a girl who goes, oh, yeah, I'm sucking your dick for you.  I want a girl that sucks dick for her.  Because she enjoys it, right?  Of course.  She's a dirty dick sucker.  Well, if there was a girl that had to put her finger in my asshole, she's like, I got 
[03:31:30]  to, motherfucker.  I got balls in my face.  I'm jerking your dick.  Yeah.  And just some fucking animal that's fucking jerking and poking.  Then I'm like, I would never cock block that.  But some chick that goes, I'm going to show you what it's like to do.  That's what most girls do to see if they can take manhood.  Because you're tired of being the fuck-ee.  Fucking brilliant.  You're the fuck-ee.  We're the fuck-er. 
[03:32:00]  Anything that makes you the fuck-ee, you like sticking a finger.  You don't want to stick a finger in a man's ass.  I don't know why you say that.  I don't know about that.  You've been with wrong women.  You've been with wrong women.  You don't want to be in there.  God damn.  Oh, man.  You've been with wrong women.  I haven't been.  I've been with every kind of piece of shit.  See what it is?  You're telling me nobody's ever.  You're telling me nobody's ever.  Every kind of piece of shit.  Nobody's ever.  Can I just ask you this, though?  I made you calm.  Lily, Lily, Lily.  By stimulating your prostate.  No.  So you're saying it's okay for a man. 
[03:32:30]  I like my nipples licked.  That's very girlish.  Let's go to Lily.  Sorry, Lily.  So it's okay for a man to degrade women sexually, but as soon as it turns around and a woman  degrading you, it's not.  I hear what you're saying.  But see, for you to degrade us, you have to do some dirty, filthy shit that we don't mind.  Now, you just told me, you just told me to remind me, it's okay for a man to do that.  Let me ask you this.  Hold on.  How would you, how do, what would you think about degrading a man?  What's degrading a man?  Yeah.  What about putting that strap on right now? 
[03:33:00]  You turn over and I'm going to fuck you in the ass.  And getting fucked in the ass.  Yeah.  The only way a woman could degrade a man is becoming the fucky.  You're the fucky.  All right.  She's on to something.  Let's turn the table.  Wait.  She's on to something.  Who wants to get fucked in the ass by Dr. Z today?  You know what?  Would you fuck someone in the ass?  Yeah.  Who wants to be fucked in the ass?  TJ's mom.  Yeah, TJ's mom.  Put your hand down.  Anyone else?  My mother did not put her hand up.  My mother did not put her hand up. 
[03:33:30]  Who wants to get fucked in the ass by a strap on from Dr. Z?  All right.  I think Eastside David.  What a strap on or anything.  The phones are lit.  I mean, people are loving this.  And I'm telling you.  Would you take it in the ass, sir?  From Dr. Z?  It's a strap on, though, and she's hot.  What if her warm boobies are on your back and she's doing it?  I'm telling you, men fucking love this.  Men love stuff up their ass.  They just want to admit it.  Goddamn Pat Duffy had to get into a relationship where we would have to take her.  Because that thing that makes them gay. 
[03:34:00]  That's why they won't admit it.  Could you do it to Lily?  That would rock.  Patrice made a great point about them being so filthy that they got to pass a level of  filth that I don't think they can attain to legitimately degrade.  They could do something to go like, oh, I'm going to degrade this person.  But what's the cool shit about degrading?  I'm sitting on your face.  I'm sitting on my assholes on your face.  Well, thank you, precious.  To me.  To me.  How about my balls?  Hey, shut up.  Shut up.  Slick my balls in your mouth.  Come on, dude.  Put your balls. 
[03:34:30]  Put my balls in your mouth.  There you go.  That's it.  Now blink, doc.  But what's the thing about degrading?  You know?  Like the whole thing.  Sex.  In order for sex to be good, it has to be dirty.  I mean, let me wrap these big white hands around your fucking head.  Shut the fuck up, doctor.  What kind of doctor are you, bitch?  Let me see your fucking credentials.  Shut up!  Come here.  You like that?  You like that fucking thing in your ass?  You like it?  Give me a kiss.  Give me a fucking kiss.  Oh, you didn't like that, did you?  How about this degrading?  You didn't like that?  How about you cum in my ass and you suck it out? 
[03:35:00]  Again, again, again, I have to do things that you do.  How about I just use you as the object you are?  Fine.  Slap you in the face.  Shut up.  Once women would like that.  Shut up.  You want cum in your mouth.  I want pussy juice.  If you put pussy juice in your ass, I'll lick it out.  But you know why?  You can't just shoo pussy juice nowhere.  Why can't you just shoo?  You haven't been the squirt of.  You can massage the squirt of.  This is really up to the answer here. 
[03:35:30]  Would Eastside Dave take it in the ass today?  Or is that cheating?  I think he would.  He really is not forever.  Would you shove it in Eastside Dave's ass?  He's redheaded.  I don't know if that matters.  He's a redhead, though.  You don't know if that matters.  You know what, though?  I like Lily.  But women cannot rise to the level.  Of filth.  Of filth that we will rise to.  All right, so this is the male filth supremacy speech.  I don't know what the fuck it is. 
[03:36:00]  I'm trying to figure out.  I'm trying to figure out what it is.  I don't think anybody does.  But I know when we fuck, what's going to happen is it all boils down to nature.  When we're fucking, eventually I will find something that makes you feel like a girl.  If I take three fingers and shove them down your throat and you go,  that's going to make you feel like a girl.  Now, you're smart enough to go, oh, I can match things.  But when you're in there like a serial killer, in the middle of the situation,  and my fucking hands are around your face, and my fucking head.  I totally love it.  Oh, shut the fuck up.  Majority of women have submission fantasies. 
[03:36:30]  Don't talk shit.  90% of women have submissive fantasies.  And you know why they have submissive fantasies?  So why are you telling me you're degrading me?  Wait a minute.  Maybe I'm going to love it.  But here's what your problem is.  Women, this is what this book is and what women's life is.  You're telling me that women don't like dirty sex.  Women want an excuse to be whores.  You want me to make it my fault that you're a whore.  That's what submissive is.  Rape fantasies, that's a woman going, oh my God, it's my fault.  Submission fantasies is rape fantasies.  It's the same shit. 
[03:37:00]  It's the same shit.  To be taken.  And this book is, hey, listen, if you want sex quickly, make me...  So what is your problem?  Let me tell you.  I'm trying to get...  What is your problem with the whole thing?  My problem is...  That women are not dirty enough?  What is the problem?  I'm about to tell you, but you'll interrupt me again.  Because you're very good.  That's why it's going to boil down to me grabbing around your fucking beach blonde hair  and dragging you around calling you the little dirty Russian that you really are.  I'm getting turned on already.  You switched seats earlier.  I'm getting turned on already.  I do have a question. 
[03:37:30]  Are you Russian by dissent?  Yes.  What if that was my follow-up to all the shit?  Yeah.  You're Russian.  This follows the whole thing, though, that you've been talking about.  Like, you get into this degrading thing and stuff and wondering where the questions are  coming from or where the whole conversation is going or how it took off in a new direction.  It's still all intertwined in this sexuality thing between men and women where guys will fuck most any girl that will fuck them.  And girls need this whole big thing happening. 
[03:38:00]  Right.  Well, you know, I explained it to you why.  It's very simple.  You explained it.  From an evolutionary perspective, sperm, there's billions of them.  There's limited amount of eggs.  You want to pass on your genes, your DNA.  I'm talking about everybody that's fucking, everyone that's fucking doesn't want to procreate  or isn't thinking about it.  You're not thinking, but subconsciously, it's always there.  But I think I think that's subconsciously.  You have an evolutionary program to do that.  I don't know.  The point that I love about the subconscious thing.  You have an evolutionary program to do that.  Then that is what evolutionary psychology is all about. 
[03:38:30]  You all think we're evolved.  We're all above that.  But you know what?  You're just a human animal.  You're just a human animal.  So women don't enjoy it as much genetically on an evolutionary level.  They don't enjoy it as much.  But women have to be more selective because guess what?  They don't want to be stuck raising all these little grass.  You wouldn't be able to be selective if you enjoyed it as much.  And hear what she just said?  It boils down to God or nature, whatever you believe in.  I don't believe in God.  I'm an atheist.  Atheist. 
[03:39:00]  So it boils down to nature making women miserable and they want us to suffer for their misery.  Because we basically, I'm telling you, raising kids for men, if I shoot it inner or if I shoot it on her, it's the same thing.  Being a father, you could be a father to somebody that you don't create.  The actual creation process is a curse for them.  Because women animals, the female human, act like a fucking turtle where she lays a hundred eggs and says good luck to you. 
[03:39:30]  Women are cursed the rest of their life with the love they have for their child.  I'm almost 40.  Why are you falling into a curse?  And my mother is cursed with the fact that she loves me.  Meaning, oh my God, I wish I didn't give a fuck about this big mouth asshole, but I'm concerned about it.  I feel like that's happening with my mother today, right now.  That's currently happening to my mother.  She's almost 60 years old and she still cares for me.  So you're telling me your father doesn't give a shit about you? 
[03:40:00]  I never met the motherfucker.  And I can understand why.  Because I could have been on a sock or I ended up inside my mother.  That's what the fuck happened.  I think that explains a lot of your anger.  Of course.  The fact that you never met your daddy.  That's all the daddy's family.  It's a speech for the daddy you never met.  Boy, I'm going to fuck your brains out, Doc.  It's the daddy's speech.  I'm going to fucking stick my thumb right in your booty hole one of these days.  Trust me.  When your fucking boyfriend looks at you and worships you, you finally get rid of that fucking asshole. 
[03:40:30]  You let me know, Miss fucking Third World.  I'm going to fucking fuck the shit out of you, Doc.  That's what I'm going to smack you all in your ass with your own book.  This is your fucking head.  I like the talk.  The talk turns me on.  Do you believe in this bullshit you wrote, huh?  Oh, please.  No more.  Shut up.  Shut up.  You know, Patrice and Mark here.  I'm mushing in her face.  I'm mushing in her face.  Patrice, you're entertaining.  Oh, my God. 
[03:41:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Here, read your fucking book, stupid.  This is what I'm doing to you.  I like that.  I like that.  That's very entertaining.  It turns me on.  Patrice pretending to suffocate you with your own book.  While I'm talking here brings up a good point.  And that point, I think, is in some ways that the book asserts that a man through these  shortcuts can get any hot woman.  And I think the thing that Anthony said is that he can't. 
[03:41:30]  That it doesn't matter what the shortcut is.  I never said that.  Patrice is saying if you're Patrice and if you have a big mouth, you can get women, which  is my point of the book.  If you have the gift of gab, use it.  You can get women.  But not everybody like Patrice.  Not everybody's that funny.  Not everybody's that obnoxious.  Not everybody's that entertaining.  But it's infinitely easy for a woman to get a man.  It is infinitely easy.  But so what?  We freaking know it.  But you know what?  That doesn't help.  You know what I decided, Dr. Z? 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  I don't want you.  All right.  Now you try to get me.  Do you know what it's called?  You get me.  That's called paradoxical intention in psychology.  I don't know what the fuck it's called.  I don't know what the fuck it's called.  In psychology.  It's called.  How are you going to get me?  I don't want you.  Why don't we agree to disagree and let's start looking at boobies.  What?  I want you.  Wait.  I don't want you.  Nothing.  How are you going to make me want you?  Come on.  Boobies.  Do something.  Yeah.  Show your boobs.  I do something.  We like your boobs.  Talk to me.  She's good at showing boobs.  Make me want you.  I guess. 
[03:42:30]  Why do I want you to want me?  That's right.  You know you want me, baby.  You know you're pretending not to like me.  No.  I'm not pretending you're 21.  You know you would fuck me in a second.  You are an ugly, beautiful woman and don't you ever forget it.  What is she on the scale now after all this?  She might.  On her best day, a 22 and a half and that is it.  I like that you gave her that half point.  So what you going to do?  I'll give you up to a 24 depending on how charming you are.  Get me.  We're not going to get to see her boobs today. 
[03:43:00]  I don't want to get you.  Yeah, but you know what, man?  Get her to show the boobs at least.  She's against me.  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not against you.  I find you very entertaining.  Yeah, you didn't break this one.  Yeah, I actually like you.  I don't think you broke her.  No, she hung in there.  I like you.  I hope she didn't break it, but I've seen her thinking.  She hung in there.  I think she's because she's always talking to guys that want to fuck her.  So they listen to this horse shit.  No, I can't say.  You know what?  My book is prototype based and I'm certain there are guys out there who don't want to fuck me.  You know why?  They're little Asian girls and I'm not a little Asian girl. 
[03:43:30]  And I'm very...  Where did that come from?  Wow.  Sounds fucking fucking Asian.  So I know that not every guy wants to fuck me.  I know that.  You got to step up the Botox, man.  We met Vicky today.  Asian.  I think no one has ever met Vicky.  Like we've met Vicky.  No, no.  We have met Vicky.  We'll get some Asian fucking going on.  But I'm trying to tell you that guess what?  There's a lid for every pot.  And I might not be your lid.  You might not be my pot.  I don't know what that means.  You're my pot.  Lily's amazed over there.  Lily, anything to add? 
[03:44:00]  No, I don't even want to try it to choose on right now.  Yeah, you might want to plug the show that...  Oh, Rana Fez, Nunez 3.  Oh, damn.  I bet it's clean as a whistle, too.  Oh, that's going to hurt.  I bet it's clean as a whistle, too, doc.  Well, we would have seen her asshole if you didn't piss her off.  I bet everything's clean.  I bet it's just fucking...  She shaves everything.  Ridiculously impeccable down there.  Yeah.  Not even a smell.  Yeah, right?  I bet you.  What do you think?  I bet you under your titties ain't even sweaty. 
[03:44:30]  Jesus.  She's a guarantee.  I bet it smells like vodka.  Doesn't he have an amazing way of complimenting people?  Fucking baby powder.  He has an amazing way of complimenting people.  Vodka and fish.  I must say it's a unique compliment, which is what I recommend in my book, Dr. Z.  I'm sorry.  See, you're covering all the bases.  Of course.  Of course.  You're covering all...  I've finally seen Patrice execute a lot of what he's talked about on his show.  He's got a good relationship, by the way, Dr. Z.  He does the bust it down, and then builds it up. 
[03:45:00]  I love this guy.  He's a swinger.  Patrice is a swinger.  Oh.  He has a main girl that pretty much lives with him, but under his rules, he has rules.  Right, Patrice?  Fuck yeah.  And you brought a big girl to see Anthony, and this big girl almost crushed Anthony when...  Oh, but he got...  But I tell you what, she did what she had to do.  She sat on my lap, and I was like...  That's what I mean.  That's what I mean.  She did what she had to do.  We're in a bar.  Pulled some titties out.  Did a little dirtiness. 
[03:45:30]  I know I wasn't your type of person, but if you're going to bring a woman around, she's  got to be that kind of soldier.  Yeah.  You were conversing with a black person?  I know.  I was drunk.  Are you insane?  With titties in his face.  With big black titties in the face.  There's National Geographic up in the bit.  They were awful titties.  Big, black, delicious titties.  Awful titties, and she's just swinging them around.  And he was being nice and fun, because he was just feeling a little melancholy, so he  wasn't being racist.  So he just let some black titties be in his face. 
[03:46:00]  And my girl...  Not your thing, huh?  I was just...  No, I don't...  I'm not into black titties in my face.  And my girl, who's a little bit probably too big in black form, like a little too...  You know, but she, you know, she put a little hot sweatiness on her.  Your girl's an animal, right?  Oh, she's a soldier.  I'm into Nazis.  You're into Nazis.  Yeah.  I like that shit.  Are you into her?  Yeah.  She's got a little bit Nazi.  She's got like a Nazi look to her.  Yeah, yeah.  Would you...  She's wearing a swastika.  Would you submit? 
[03:46:30]  No, I'm not submissive.  No, I'm not submissive like that.  But he's got a big heart.  The whole thing, the Aryan thing, is like a little bit of a submissive thing going on.  No, because I'm...  But I'm a Nazi, so I like, you know, I'm the one that would be...  Okay, so...  You know, the one...  Dominating.  No, no, no, no, no, no blood intermixing.  It has to be like a...  Look at her, though.  She is sexy, though.  She's buying the whole thing.  What color are your nipples, Biggie?  What color are they?  Yeah, like a little pink.  Yeah. 
[03:47:00]  Delicious.  How big the clit?  A little...  A very big.  You got a big clit, like a little baby thumb?  Yeah.  I have a giant clit.  As a matter of fact, Howard Stern thought it'd look like a mini penis.  Is it really sensitive?  Yeah, it was a little intimidated by it.  Can we see it?  When my pet of the year lay out.  Is it really sensitive?  You're going to have to get my pet of the year lay out.  Why?  Extremely sensitive.  Can we see it?  Is it really?  Well, it has to be aroused to be at its prime.  So do you like the tongue go back and forth or up and down?  Back and forth or up and down?  Up and down, back and forth.  You know, creativity. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, back and forth.  Because I'm very clinical with men.  I'm a two-thumb, open-up guy.  Good, good.  Here it is, right?  Nice.  Very nice.  And I'm very business-like.  Can you stick out your tongue?  I want to see.  Because the length of the tongue is important, too, actually.  If it matches my dick, it's a mess.  That's why good pussy, really good.  I do a lot of stuff to make you think you had a meal, and then I give you a small dessert.  Do you like for a woman to sit on your face?  That's important.  I can give a fuck.  You can sit anywhere you want.  Anywhere you want. 
[03:48:00]  And you don't have to do much.  I'm a giver.  Let's see.  That's a good thing.  Would you sit on Patricia's face?  And actually, what...  You know, I talk about the book and that in the book.  You know what?  The size doesn't matter as long as you can give.  You know, most women get off on your tongue.  That's all they want.  They don't give a shit about your dick.  Delicious.  They want your tongue.  They want your tongue there.  I bet your pussy tastes like Chernobyl.  It tastes like pineapple.  What does Chernobyl taste like?  Because I eat a lot of pineapples, which is the key to tasting well.  Lots of bromelain in it.  Yeah, lots of fruits. 
[03:48:30]  I'm a vegetarian.  Lots and lots of fruits.  My girl eats a lot of mini burgers from Ruby Tuesdays.  What does that taste like?  That tastes nasty.  What does Sliders taste like?  That creates a nasty taste.  That's her.  Let me get a close-up of that.  We could go like...  Give me that.  Okay, that right one there.  The right one there.  That's her.  And hands.  It's pretty.  It's pretty nice.  And your tit job is good, too.  That means you filled it in.  You had kids?  No, you don't have any kids?  I have kids.  You had kids.  So she had...  My mother just...  No, no, this was before the kids.  And she goes... 
[03:49:00]  Yeah, but you have a good tit job because that means that what happens is girls that have  tit jobs like that, they lost...  Like, they had kids and they got that baggy, saggy, so when they got the job, it wasn't  to...  Well...  It wasn't to make titties bigger.  It was just to fill it in.  Right, he's right.  He's very perceptive.  But that's not what happened to me.  I went one size up.  If you go more than two sizes and then it makes it look fake.  So why do they say...  Why, they look good.  Nice.  All nice and open.  Move that thing.  What the fuck is that thing? 
[03:49:30]  And go down, go down a little bit.  There you go.  There you go.  To where we can see that face.  Oh.  Delicious.  Let me see the face there.  Oh, there it is.  Nice.  Oh, look at that little fucking...  Get out of...  Get out of Russia.  Now, how...  Get out of Russia free card.  So why don't you describe what you're going to do to me?  I wish...  Describe the technique for the guys out there.  Isn't it a shame that there's a fucking guy in Russia that can't get out because his  dick is swinging?  He's just running around Russia like, please, get me out of here.  My dick is out.  But, boy, you just showed your little twat and fucking first class flight right out of 
[03:50:00]  that shit hole.  Right to America.  That's not how it happened.  I actually came on an academic scholarship as an exchange student.  I shed my clothes later.  Stop with the fucking storm.  Now, is this strange to see that you're nude here and all of us have now seen you naked?  Is that strange at all?  You know what?  I've been...  She was topless last time she was in here, but...  I've been doing nude modeling for 15 years.  Do you think it's like a second nature?  I get invited to the...  Patrice. 
[03:50:30]  Vicky, Vicky, just slide that up.  Why don't you describe what you're going to do to me?  I want to hear your technique.  The guys want to know.  The guys want to know your technique.  My technique is very clinical.  I'm telling you.  I've lost all passion.  You take two thumbs and you slide it up either side of the lips and push it up until the clitoris  is exposed and then you place...  Wait a minute.  I'm telling you now.  Do you expose the clitoris?  I'm going to tell you the fucking story.  So you slide it open and then you put your chin where the pussy hole is to rest it. 
[03:51:00]  And then stick your tongue in and back and...  In the side?  No, no, no.  On the clip.  On the clip, right?  On the clip.  And I'm a back and forth.  I don't do any up and down.  But what about some sucking action?  You got to add some sucking action to it.  If you look at it.  If you want that in your movie, you direct your movie.  In my movie, you come as fast as those men come.  And that's a guaranteed fact.  This is a fucking technique in over eight different countries, baby.  All right.  Except for yours.  I don't know.  But I have been close.  I have been in fucking Holland. 
[03:51:30]  Is there any way we can set up a double date with Lily, me, Patrice, and Dr. Z?  Would that be possible?  Are you hitting on Lily?  Wow.  That came out of left field.  I'm trying to get to fuse some tension.  I feel like the two of us are connected a little longer.  Lily, would you be interested in T.J. Miller?  I haven't seen Cloverfield.  Holy shit.  So, I'm...  She has to see it.  What are you talking about right now?  By the way, her boss hated Cloverfield.  How about that?  God.  All right. 
[03:52:00]  Never mind.  Sorry, Mom.  Sorry.  You're right.  Patrice is right.  That's exactly what we're talking about.  That's a little too much.  I don't get movie stars.  I don't like movie stars right there and then.  The whole thing with Hollywood, it's a big turn off to me.  Hate Hollywood.  Never dated anybody in Hollywood.  But you dated Donald Trump.  Well, because he promised me a $50,000 campaign.  I never slept with him because he was full of it.  So, yeah.  But no, I don't like Hollywood.  The whole thing is turn off.  But if he gave you the money, you would have fucked him?  I don't think so.  How much would that have cost?  I would have taken the money and still didn't fuck him.  People are saying that she really wants to get off, so you really should talk to her 
[03:52:30]  now, Patrice.  She wants to what?  Patrice, she wants to get off.  Describe it to her.  Read between the lines.  That's George Higgins from Florida.  What lines am I reading?  I'm ready to go.  I'm ready to read this.  She wants to hear what you would do to her.  I just told her.  Well, because I described specific techniques in my book, Doctors, You, and Scoring.  So, I want to know what kind of techniques you're going to describe in your book.  Give me.  I don't describe sex techniques because my thing is not about sex.  Well, how are you going to teach guys, though?  How are you going to teach them?  How are you going to teach these guys from Florida to the girl? 
[03:53:00]  My angle is not to teach guys how to fuck.  My angle is to teach guys how to be happy when they're dealing with women.  That's all my thing is.  It's how to be happy versus this shit here.  It's how to be happy.  That's it.  I don't teach guys how to eat pussy.  Wait.  Do you realize that 70% of women out there do not have consistent orgasm because women,  because guys do not give them head.  I just told you how to.  I like eating pussy.  So, you need to write a book about why guys need to eat more pussy. 
[03:53:30]  It would be a one paragraph thing.  I don't want to tell guys to eat pussy.  There's a lot of them who don't like and they want to do it.  And then they complain that the women don't go down on them.  So, the trickle down theory.  That's all.  What's that?  If I'm happy, then you'll be happy.  That's all I'm saying.  Well, that's very simple.  And that's the whole premise of my book.  But let me ask you a question.  Let me ask you this.  Yes.  I'm looking at you.  You really, I do admit that even talking to you, I'm feeling reversed on my own thing. 
[03:54:00]  I got all emotional.  Then I came down and it's like I'm feeling Dr. Z a little more than I felt an hour ago.  That's why you guys should do a show together.  Yeah.  And can I just say.  So, I grew on you.  You guys would probably have angry sex at the end of your radio show.  I grew from like 20 to like 22.  And now like making my way up to like maybe 23 at this point.  And let me ask you a question.  She's insulted that you weren't higher in the 20s.  Let's be honest.  No, I'm not.  I mean, I said.  22 and a half.  22 and a half.  Listen, everybody's got their own prototype.  There's guys who couldn't even get it up for me.  I mean, I realize that everybody's got their own prototype.  Who couldn't get it up for you? 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, I don't know about that.  Because there's guys out there who are into different types of women.  There are guys who are into flat-chested women.  There's guys who are into muscular women.  I mean, I don't have the muscle.  Everybody's got their own thing.  Is that possible?  And not because they said you did it before.  I would have wondered this in the first place.  I might not have asked you because you're Dr. Z.  But I'm asking Victoria.  I want to know.  How can you tell?  I just want to see if it's a good job or not.  Is that possible? 
[03:55:00]  Just to see.  Because on there was fabulous.  But it was all whatever.  So after you saw naked pictures, Patrice, now you mellowed out.  Now you want to see my boobs.  Yeah, yes.  You got me.  You got me.  I would love to see him naturally.  The angry Patrice is gone.  Now he's asleep.  I don't think he's asking for much.  No, no.  And I'm not saying I'm not going to do it.  I mean, I'm proud of my breasts.  Let's take a look.  Let's take a look.  I want to see what he likes to see him.  I like 10 in the morning breasts.  Lily, come on over here.  Lily wants to see him.  Here's Lily to check out boobs. 
[03:55:30]  And can my mom come in the studio if she wants to?  If she would like.  Sure.  TJ's mom, you're more than welcome to see boobs.  She's a doctor also.  She's got prescriptive authority.  They look very, very...  That's a great job.  Is that a mole?  They're beautiful.  Dr. G and Papa.  Is that a mole up there?  Yes.  Real mole.  Aw.  Not a third nipple.  Real mole.  They're not real.  They're slightly in hands.  Slightly in hands.  They're well done.  And where'd he go in?  Uh. 
[03:56:00]  He goes in underneath.  No nipple?  You didn't go through the areola?  I don't recommend through the areola because it reduces sensitivity of the areola.  Fuck.  Yes.  Don't do it through the areola.  Lily, what do you think?  I think they're really nice.  Dr. G and Papa.  I'm really jealous.  Can Lily squeeze him?  May I see the underneath part?  I'll touch him.  Can Lily squeeze him?  Wow.  Can I touch him?  Yeah, you can't feel it.  What is it?  Is it like saline?  Saline.  Under the muscle.  You can't feel him.  You can't touch them like they're food.  That's not how you touch your food. 
[03:56:30]  You can't touch them like they're food.  I just don't know.  You can't touch them like they're food.  Why don't you just stab it with a fork?  Why don't you touch it?  Oh, man.  Oh, you got me in this?  The correct way.  Yeah.  No.  No.  No.  You got to, like, get the wah-wah.  TJ, do you mind a man's holler?  Patrice is not angry anymore.  No.  His anger dissipated like the morning fog.  Mm-hmm.  I just don't want to put no poetry stuff.  What's the same thing as that?  I just don't want to put no poetry stuff.  I'm poetic, too.  I don't want to put any black fingerprints on that titty.  Yeah.  If something happens to you later, my fingerprints are going to be all over it. 
[03:57:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Patrice is always thinking.  I love that black guy's face.  Always thinking.  Yeah.  Mmm.  Delicious.  TJ, better than the Cloverfield monster.  Where's your camera at now?  Yeah, I wish I'd had it.  It would be a lot stellar.  I'm very disappointed in how Lily touched the boobs.  Oh, come on.  You were poking at it.  No, I cupped it.  Lily, take your middle finger.  Yeah, let Patrice walk it through this.  And listen, Lily, just take your middle finger and do this counterclockwise on the nipple.  That's all.  Go ahead, Precious.  Yeah. 
[03:57:30]  All right, Precious.  Your middle finger.  My middle finger.  And wait a minute.  Don't barely touch it.  And then circular.  All right.  What is the sex instruction now from Patrice?  There you go.  Why is TJ's mom coming in?  This is not in pictures.  This is a big moment.  She's taking pictures of her son in the room with a penthouse playmate.  Slash doctor.  Penthouse pet of the year.  Don't confuse it.  With her breasts out.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Pet of the year.  Let it be known that TJ's mom is now taking pictures of Dr. Z.  This is going to go to the entire family.  See, the mistake most guys make is they just grab them.  Hold on.  You've got to caress the breast. 
[03:58:00]  Can I direct a little bit?  I've been just sitting on the sidelines here.  TJ's mom's looking for a nice photo op.  Could you put your boobs maybe around TJ's head like headphones and we get a nice picture?  Sure.  Which is really nice.  All right.  Okay.  Get on your knees there, TJ.  And for the record, just because he's a nice guy, not because I'm impressed by any whatever.  Because I'm a movie star.  Hollywood I don't give a shit about.  Here we go.  This is the photo op for TJ's mom.  This is special.  Turn around to TJ's mom.  No, put the boobs right around his head there.  Take the headphones off, TJ.  Sorry. 
[03:58:30]  All right.  Boops around his ears.  TJ is sweating now.  He hasn't been sweating the whole show.  And there you go.  Mom taking a picture.  Just a sleeping one.  Just one where I'm sleeping.  Putting his head on the boobies.  Just sleeping.  Let me talk to Vicky for a minute.  I've got to say, those feel a lot like doctor's breasts.  You know what I mean?  You can tell that she has a PhD.  Tremendous little breasts.  So where am I now on the scale?  I'm just curious.  Did I make it to 24 yet? 
[03:59:00]  Dr. Z, this is really not fair.  We were getting the bestie.  You pull those things out, and now we're all calm.  Oh, man, I'm shallow.  What can I say?  You're shallow.  See, I get impressed by your intelligence, by your quick wit, by your humor.  Are you guys just impressed by that boob joke?  Wow, exactly.  But it would have been interesting to see that entire argument between Patrice and her  with her tits out.  Hey, Dr. Z, what's two plus two?  Please tell me, because I love a girl that knows math. 
[03:59:30]  Can we see, like, more parts?  Delicious.  Maybe when I come in to plug my next book.  But right now, this is for DrZOnScoring.com.  It probably looks like Vietnam down there.  I can feel she's a little emotional.  Vietnam?  Yeah, there's some hemorrhaging going on, I can tell.  She wasn't prepared to show anything, that's why.  Oh, you think it's growing in a little bit?  Yeah, see how she looked up?  Yeah.  Looked like a murder scene. 
[04:00:00]  He's trying to use reverse psychology on me, but it doesn't work.  Looked like Scarface down there.  React and slow.  Where's Eastside Dave?  We're waiting for the grand finale here.  Apparently he's late.  He's getting it up the ass, like it or not.  He was talking a good game on Ron and Fez yesterday.  I'd love to stick around, but...  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  I got a plane to catch.  All right, go ahead.  We'll see you later, Ann.  Enjoy.  I'm staying.  There's my point.  Here's a guy from Indiana who doesn't like eating girls out, right? 
[04:00:30]  What is he saying?  I don't know.  That would mean, you know, going on with him.  Oh, he doesn't like sex.  He just likes eating girls out.  Oh, he's just eating girls out.  That's interesting.  He usually comes in at around 11, so I don't think he'd be much later.  All right, because, you know, he was talking a good game on Ron and Fez.  Now we make him look stupid once again.  That's our whole goal in life is to make Eastside Dave look stupid.  What?  Break.  And then just while we wait for Dave to come up, he's very close. 
[04:01:00]  He's on his way up, I believe.  All right, we're going to take a break and wrap up this show next.  Delicious.  We might be losing Anthony.  We might not.  Yeah, I got to go.  We're probably losing Anthony, but I'm going to stick around for Eastside Dave's ass fucking  I'll listen.  I'm going to drive home.  Okay.  I would like to, I think I have to leave also.  What?  Well, you're right.  I'll stay.  What am I talking about?  I got to go plug the comic show.  It was trying to be a big Hollywood big show.  Well, I went, I would, I would like to invite you, Dr. Z, to come to, I have two shows 
[04:01:30]  at comics this weekend, Friday and Saturday at 845 and 1040.  Look in her eyes.  Look in her eyes.  Look in her eyes.  Trying.  I'm trying.  I'm trying.  So you should come to that.  Funny guy.  I'll bring you up on stage and we'll, we'll plug your book.  All right.  We'll consider it.  Give me the information.  Okay.  Oh, geez.  That sounded like a positive yes.  Dr. Z, Vicky loves assholes.  She likes getting treated bad.  Yeah.  Vicky likes getting treated bad.  Well, she must love the shit out of you.  TJ, TJ, you're, you're too nice. 
[04:02:00]  You think?  All right.  Fuck you, Dr. Z.  Wow.  I don't give a fuck if you come to my show or not.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break and we're going to take a break and wait for Backside Dave.  And we'll wrap up the Opie and Anthony show next.  Stay there.  There's a nips.  There's a nips.  There's a nips.  There's a nips.  There's a nips.  There's a nips.  There's a nips.  Just shooting right out of there, too.  Getting hard.  Mon âne est de façon insensée fucable.  My ass is insanely fuckable.  Aimeriez-vous pincer ma tarte frémission d'amour?  Would you like to pinch my quivering love pie? 
[04:02:30]  Mes sons sont comme deux mille ampoules de watts.  My breasts are like 2,000 watt light bulbs.  Aimeriez-vous jouer l'air dans Tokyo?  Would you like to play Tune in Tokyo?  Oh, seulement Opie and Anthony pouvant satisfaire mon besoin pour la géante palpitante, la viande d'hommes américaines. 
[04:03:00]  Only Opie and Anthony can satisfy my need for giant, pulsating American man meat.  All right, we're back with the Opie Show.  We're pretty much playing Last Man Standing.  I win today.  We lost Jimmy yesterday.  We lost Anthony today.  He's heading to the airport to go up to Cleveland for Jimmy's sold-out shows at the House of Blues.  We lost T.J. Miller and his mom.  They left as well.  T.J.'s going to be at comics tonight and tomorrow night. 
[04:03:30]  He's hoping that a lot of people show up and check out his comedy.  Very funny guy, T.J. Miller and a real good friend of the show.  So if you're in New York City, comics downtown, c-o-m-i-x-n-y.com on the internet there to find out directions and where it's located and all that crap.  Okay.  Patrice O'Neal, what's up?  Nothing.  Just listening.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  Wait, what are you guys doing?  I was showing a picture of my girl to see if she could do a little something.  That's pretty hot.  She's pretty hot.  Would you, uh...  He's trying to talk me into a threesome.  Well, what do you think? 
[04:04:00]  I gotta see more pictures.  More pictures?  What?  That was a fucking great picture.  Yeah, that was a good one, but she has some kind of mask on her face.  That was some...  Oh, wait, sorry.  She's got to show me a picture of a girl with a mask.  I mean, great body, great figure, nice dids and everything.  What's the mask all about, Patrice?  But she's got to, like, um...  Because we was doing some mask stuff.  We was doing some mask stuff.  Here, look.  Look at this one.  I mean, it's hot as, like, um...  God bless Patrice.  Like a cat woman type of mask.  Oh, we're just doing some mask stuff.  Yeah, she's hot.  Not, I don't know, it's a Halloween party. 
[04:04:30]  And then here, like, I guess she's, like, what is it, Dominique?  She's got, like, a little slave collar on her?  Yeah, but she's spitting in my face.  Let's look at that picture.  We're going to wrap up the show, but we do want to play something called, uh, Moment of Truth.  Now, you would, you really would, like, uh, fuck some guy in the ass with a strap-on?  Sure.  Really?  I'm not sure I want to do it on the show, but I do enjoy doing it from time to time.  I've got a little bit of a dominant side going on.  You've got to switch up from time to time.  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, let's say hi to Eastside Dave. 
[04:05:00]  Hello there, everyone.  I just got in, and I heard something about a banging in the ass there?  Yeah.  By me?  Well, uh, Eastside Dave, first of all, Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Oh, you son of a fucking bitch.  I just got in.  I was looking at you.  I just got in.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  I just got in.  Yeah.  There's a ten-second rule with that.  Uh, little known fact, I love the Ron and Fez show, and you were talking about maybe,  you know, getting it up the ass, right?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, no, no, no.  I said it's a fantasy of mine. 
[04:05:30]  Right.  Uh, by my wife.  Right.  I think I need to make that clear.  Okay.  Um.  He doesn't want to do it on the national radio.  No, I have no problem with that.  If my wife could be shipped in, because I just got a text message, uh, if you get banged  in the ass by that doctor, I'm leaving you.  And she's pregnant with his kid, so.  And she's pregnant, and I never want to let down Mr. Opie here.  Yeah.  You know, so I figure if you want.  You were supposed to be the grand finale of this fine radio show.  I know.  We had a great week of radio, and we're thinking, Eastside Dave getting banged in the ass, boom, 
[04:06:00]  everyone goes home for the weekend.  You know, I would love to get fucked in the ass by you, for you guys, but again, if my  wife was the one doing it, I have some fidelity.  Um, I don't want to let you down.  I have some fidelity issues.  We do, you do have the strap on here, correct?  We have the strap on.  How about this for a trade-off?  Simulated.  And it's not cheating, really, because, like, we got condoms and stuff, and she's, it's,  it's not cheating if you're getting fucked with basically a belt.  I, I, I, she, my wife, said she'll leave me! 
[04:06:30]  What?  She'll leave me!  And she's not the one to say empty shirts.  Show them the strap on.  Show them the strap on.  Oh, I've seen the strap on.  Yeah.  And believe me, it looks, look, I'll, I'll gladly give you a trade-off.  What's the trade-off?  Because I can't, I can't interact with females, otherwise you can start cheating.  E-Rock puts the strap on on, and it'll suck his dildo cock.  You want something gay, I'll bring it to you.  Well, I don't think we're asking for something gay.  No, it's nothing to do with being gay. 
[04:07:00]  You kind of twisted that a little bit.  Put on the dildo, it'll suck your cock.  I thought you were going to say, I think I'm allowed a, a, a pinky from Dr. Z.  I didn't know it was going to go into this territory.  I'll take, take a pinky from any ONA male staff member.  No, well, uh, or Patrice.  What, what are you doing, Pitts?  I don't know, E-Rock.  I'll put the dildo on if Dave wants to suck it.  I prefer an ONA.  But what does that have to do with it?  I was talking about a woman.  Yeah, she wants to fuck you in the ass with a strap on.  And she has a relationship too.  The guy has a beer belly.  I know, hey. 
[04:07:30]  I'm talking about enhancing male pleasure, about give and take, and about prostate massage,  and all that kind of stuff.  What does that have to do with sucking?  Would you accept a prostate massage?  A prostate massage?  Can we get your wife on the phone?  Maybe we can negotiate.  Something.  Um, you can try.  I'll give her the phone number.  Maybe I can get you a raise, I think.  I think I can get you a raise.  Listen, if she's going to do a prostate exam?  Yeah, it's officially a prostate exam.  A dildo in the ass.  With a strap on dildo.  All right.  But at least you'll, you'll find out at the end if you have cancer or not. 
[04:08:00]  All right.  So I think we get something done out of this.  And I probably do have cancer.  Don't live a clean lifestyle, Mr. Opie.  What?  Oh.  Lily, what's the deal?  Are we going to get this done?  Are we going to get, are we going to get this done with Eastside Dave?  You'll get something out of me.  I'm surprised that E-Rock doesn't want a dildo cock sock, but.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  No, that's, that's not good enough.  Dr. Z was really hoping to fuck someone today.  Yeah.  I mean, you.  I was really hoping to actually do it to Patrice, but he's not up for it, I think. 
[04:08:30]  Patrice?  He's not up for, he's not up for prostate massage.  If you, if you get naked and you step up to that level where you strap it on and you're  standing there naked ready to fuck somebody's ass, I'll, I'll do it.  But I, that's how much I bet you're full of shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  You would actually take this.  Look, I said what I said.  I'm not going to keep talking to you.  Interesting.  Interesting.  So, balls in your court, doc.  Wow. 
[04:09:00]  You're ready to get fucked in the ass by Dr. Z.  You keep stalling, baby.  Go ahead.  So all I have to do is get naked.  Keep stalling.  And put on.  Take your fucking clothes off.  Why are you taking your pants off me, so I say?  What the fuck?  You getting turned on?  Keep, keep, get naked, strap on that dildo and kablau.  Fuck it.  So shall we do it?  Patrice is a man of his word.  I'll tell you right now.  I'll tell you right now.  Then we'll do it.  Ready?  Yeah.  You have to get naked first.  That was the only rule. 
[04:09:30]  We got your wife on the phone.  Is she going to be mad?  Is she going to hate me now?  No.  I mean.  Get ready for the strap on.  She is what she is.  All right.  Dr. Z is getting naked.  Get ready for the strap on.  Get ready for the strap on.  See, Patrice doesn't believe you.  I mean, we've already seen you with your top off.  I can't get naked?  You can get naked.  Guys are pushing their faces up against the glass.  This could be radio history.  What do you think so far there, Patrice?  These old lady fucking stockings is bothering me, but I'm going to see what happens. 
[04:10:00]  What is up?  I don't know.  Just regular stockings.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Patrice, she's getting naked.  Patrice, get your ass ready.  I'm going to see this fucking guy.  She's getting naked, Patrice.  Patrice, you don't think I can get naked?  Do you know how many times I've been naked?  Strap on and ready to go.  You got to get the strap on and everything.  Why do you got the pantyhose on?  Oh, these pantyhose are making my stomach hurt.  Because it's cold outside.  Is there a hole in your pantyhose? 
[04:10:30]  It's right near Ground Zero?  No, I don't know.  Okay, but she's taking her stockings off.  Eastside, focus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I lost all my guys.  I need some help here.  Get ready.  Okay.  All right.  Dr. Z is now down to some fine panties.  I matched the bra.  Yeah, I told you.  But she's now losing the bra, Patrice.  Nice leopard print.  Oh.  What do you think, Eastside Dave?  Well, they're large. 
[04:11:00]  Wait a minute.  We're not, we're talking.  She picked up the belt.  This is my girl calling me right now.  See, now, now, who is backing out of it?  Now he's backing out.  You just told me.  Wait a minute.  Oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  You broke your phone.  I'm waiting because I'm a strap on.  I'm only pantyhose.  Wait, all right.  She's only pantyhose.  Wait, don't go nowhere.  Don't go.  Wait, did she do the pill?  Now, for the record, he just broke his cell phone.  He broke his cell phone.  Oh, fuck me.  Wait.  Don't go nowhere.  Keep going, man. 
[04:11:30]  I'm ready to fuck you.  Keep going.  Are you ready to get fucked?  No, he's calling his girl back.  Oh, my God.  No, forget about that.  She's just a vagina.  She doesn't really matter.  Remember?  Oh.  No, no, no.  Yeah, she don't.  But just.  It doesn't really matter at all.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll get her on the phone.  You want to get her on the radio, Patrice?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  We're going to get her on the radio.  Yeah, because.  Eastside Dave.  Yeah, she's just a vagina, though.  She's just a vagina.  I can't believe it.  Fuck, I'll get rid of her on the speakerphone.  And she has to play along.  Remember, you are the one who are making the rules.  All right.  Get some headphones on. 
[04:12:00]  Yeah.  We got the lovely Casey on the phone.  Eastside Dave's wife.  And we're getting Patrice's chick on the air.  Casey.  I think Patrice's asshole is getting scared.  Hold on.  We got.  Get your headphones on.  We got.  Wow.  E-Rock is actually sitting in Anthony's seat.  You are a brave man.  Eastside Dave, your wife's on the phone.  Hi, baby.  Hi, baby.  So there's a doctor in here who's blonde and has a, you know, she's a female doctor. 
[04:12:30]  She really is a doctor.  It says it right on her book, Dr. Z.  She wants to bang me with a dildo.  I know.  She's very pretty.  She wants to bang me with a dildo.  So what's your stance on that?  Is that the infidelity or does that text message of my.  The bag's getting packed.  Does that ring true?  That rings absolutely true.  Oh, jeez.  You know why?  Let me finish why real quick.  I'm sitting here, bloated, crampy, carrying your fucking kid.  Oh.  Fasten your DNA on.  Your parasitic DNA.  My friend is over here. 
[04:13:00]  My friend Chip is here.  And I'm not asking him to bang me in the ass in solidarity.  I really think that it's unfair.  So you're trying to say that this would actually be a treat for Eastside Dave.  It would be.  That's the thing.  They were wondering how about a prostate check because she is a doctor and that's just like  a pinky and it's honestly, that's just, you know, that's just a problem.  That's just checking my health.  Casey, you understand radio.  She's naked.  She's got to do something now.  Or she's not naked yet though.  She doesn't need to go shoving her digits in my husband. 
[04:13:30]  But her pinky just for, to check my prostate.  What the fuck?  No.  How about I make a deal?  I'll pal talk my cam up and Chip can put his finger in my ass.  Oh, nice.  That's a good trade off.  That would be nice.  Why does that make you feel?  Well, because you don't have a prostate.  Well, she can pretend.  You know what?  Why doesn't he check to see how the baby's coming along then?  Oh, jeez.  All right.  So I guess the answer is no.  I'm still willing to. 
[04:14:00]  Wait, you wouldn't consider it bad if I sucked E-Rock's dildo cock, would you?  That I would actually enjoy and think it's funny.  All right.  We might do that.  All right.  We got to say goodbye to Casey.  Bye, baby.  Because now we have Patrice's girl on the phone.  Patrice's girl, everyone.  I don't think she's ever been on our show.  No.  Patrice's girl, how are you?  Hi, everybody.  How are you?  Good.  Now, as Dr. Z was getting completely naked, or she was almost completely naked, and she  was reaching for the strap-on to fuck Patrice in the ass, Patrice's phone  ring, and that would have been you.  So now we got you on the radio. 
[04:14:30]  Well, because Patrice is a man of his word, but I had to intersect because I'm not there.  And the only problem with her sticking something in his ass is I'm not there to stick something  in her ass.  All right.  So that's the only problem, then?  That's the only problem.  Coming over.  We could all have a date, and if he still wants to stick to his word, that's fine with  me.  Now, have you ever stuck anything up his ass?  I don't think anything about his ass without anything going in your ass.  Now, have you ever stuck anything up Patrice's ass? 
[04:15:00]  No.  So you haven't tried it?  You don't know if he's really into it, or has he resisted his ass exploration?  That's not something I'm really interested in, so I just never went there.  Okay.  And I don't think that he's interested in that.  Well, you never know until you try.  Well, I'm going to get fucked in my ass right now, baby.  Hang up on him.  All right.  Hanging up on Patrice's girl.  She'll look at it.  There you go.  I listened to Patrice.  There you go.  All right. 
[04:15:30]  Get naked, honey.  Let's see what's going on here.  All right.  So now you're down to panties, right?  So we'll find out if he likes it or not, right?  Dr. Z, who hated everybody a mere hour and a half ago, is now completely naked.  And now she's attempting to...  Wow.  You've done that before.  That strap-on went right on.  Okay.  Very seamless.  Yeah.  She knew what she was doing there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Fit like a glove.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What, Patrice?  White dildo?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, shit. 
[04:16:00]  Oh, fucking wait a minute.  A white dildo?  I don't think that's acceptable.  Well, we got black...  You didn't fucking say...  We got black condoms.  Wait a minute.  But you didn't say a fucking black dildo, man.  What's wrong with the white...  Why didn't you say a white dildo?  What's wrong with the white dildo?  Hey, I'm a white girl.  Dude, I can't...  I'm a white girl.  I can't get...  If I had a penis, I would have been a white penis.  This is a little weird, because now she's got the dildo on with the strap on.  You gotta get...  You can't back out.  Patrice's close right here.  Shit.  You know it ain't gonna...  You know that bullshit.  Come on, baby. 
[04:16:30]  She's mad at shit, man.  She's mad at shit.  Sweetie, listen.  Hello?  Don't you say my pussy smell like mini burgers now?  Wait, what'd she say again?  She said I said her pussy smell like mini burgers on the...  You know I ain't getting fucked in my ass by this goofy bitch.  I'm just...  I just wanna...  I just wanna see her naked, man.  No, you are.  Oh, you're not a man of your word.  Ah, fuck it.  I lied.  What are you...  I lied, bitch.  What do you want me to do?  I'm about to see her naked.  You just pussied out. 
[04:17:00]  That's true.  You are true.  You're a pussy.  Is your girl alright, Patrice?  Patrice O'Neal just admitted that he's just a pussy.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Sweetie, I'm just a pussy.  Oh, she hung up on me.  He's scared of being dumped by his girlfriend.  He's scared of...  Yes, I am.  His ass being spoiled.  Dave's pants are down.  He's scared of having...  Dave, what are you doing?  What are you doing, Dave?  I thought I was going to see some ass-banging, so it was just for access.  Are you allowed to jerk off if she's naked? 
[04:17:30]  I don't know.  Get her back on the phone.  Alright, Casey, if you're still listening, get a call back.  We've got to know if Dave's allowed to jerk off, because he's down to his really awful  boxer.  Patrice, Patrice, and I thought you were the man of your word.  That dildos...  I didn't know if there was a white dildo begging for you.  No, but it's very non-hard.  It's just going to smush against your ass.  I'm trying to figure out, at what point, how do I pull my pants down, bend over, and  get fucked in my ass by Dr. Z? 
[04:18:00]  Here's a black one just for you.  Alright, guys.  Now look more.  Patrice, the black one's here.  I'd like to apologize for lying to you.  Oh, yeah.  Now you look awkward.  Now you're naked with a strap on.  I don't know when to fuck.  He looks awkward.  I don't look awkward.  I just...  I'm a liar.  I've lied before.  Okay, you're a liar.  And I apologize.  You're a pussy.  And God has forgiven me.  Hey, can we do something with Lily?  Oh, um...  I don't want to get fucked in my ass. 
[04:18:30]  See, everybody just talk here.  You guys just talk when he...  Hey, number three.  You know, some great promotion for Ronda Fez.  I will say that you fucking stepped up to the plate, Jack.  I will say you are standing there butt naked with a fucking strap on on.  Well, can we at least have you suck this strap on?  I'm not sucking a fake dick.  I will.  Not on her.  Now that I have a strap on.  Wait, you're allowed to?  You're not cheating.  Come on.  Casey, you should allow that.  Get her back on the phone.  All right, let's get her back on the phone. 
[04:19:00]  We got a couple more options.  Before I'm out of the studio, somebody's going to suck the strap on.  I mean, that really sounded like concentration camp shit.  It's right there.  How about we allow this?  He said, Dave sucks Dr. Z's cock.  And while it's in your mouth, you promote Ronda Fez.  And Patrice admitted his defeat.  We need some kind of finale for this week of radio.  Noon to three, by the way.  We only have 18 minutes left before the computer shuts us off.  Patrice, look at the call. 
[04:19:30]  They're saying you're a pussy.  See?  Yeah.  Yeah, I am.  I am.  I'm not taking a fucking dildo in my butthole.  You're afraid of the best orgasm of your life.  Dave, you got your headphones on?  Hold on, hold on.  Frustate stimulation, baby.  We got Casey back.  Casey.  Yesy.  Hi, how are you?  Hi.  Baby.  You know I love you.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Maybe, would I be allowed to...  Now, is that racist?  Why is the black one so much bigger than the white one?  Oh, come on.  You know the answer to that.  You've had a... 
[04:20:00]  You said you had hundreds of them.  Actually, researchers showed there is no difference.  Yeah.  It's all in your mind.  Researchers were white men, she forgot to say.  All right, Casey, how do we get this done?  What if Dave has his hands behind his back and Dr. Z has her hands behind her back, so  technically he's just sucking on a dildo that's kind of floating in space?  Again, I present you with the option that I do the same thing here.  Oh, Dave.  Chip sucking a dildo on you?  You brought home that strap-on.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[04:20:30]  Thank you for telling them that.  You brought home a strap-on.  I did, yeah.  Just for fun.  Oh, my God.  Not just as a joke, you know.  Everyone does fun little gags on their wives.  Dave, it looks like you're out.  I'm sorry.  I know you want to suck Dr. Z's cock, but I don't think it's going to happen.  No, man.  It's not.  And Opie, you're always saying you want to take the gay out of the show.  Have Lily do it.  Ooh, Lily.  Come on.  Big grand finale.  No, no.  That's not.  That's fair.  See, I need a guy. 
[04:21:00]  My whole point is the prostate massage.  I'm trying to prove that.  The whole point is to destroy madness.  No.  To shove something in somebody's asshole.  No, no, no.  My whole point is.  You've got a few Chernobyl moles, by the way.  I see another one on your side there.  I see another moles.  Stop picking my moles and volunteer for the best orgasm of your life.  I can't volunteer for an ass fucker.  See, now you guys are all pussies.  You were calling.  I never said Dave said he would do it.  I said I would do it with my wife.  The only thing that happens in poker when you call a bluff is you win.  Like, you won. 
[04:21:30]  You call my bluff and you get respect for that.  We just figured out how to get you naked.  That's all.  I am not taking a dildo in my ass cheeks.  So we don't have anybody here who is willing to get asked for war to at least suck this strap on.  Or some interns that want to have a...  Big man's like, he looked back.  This guy, the bald dude, he looked right back like, I know you motherfuckers ain't looking at me.  He looked right back and said, which one are you pussies?  Hey, my body looks pretty damn good on the camera. 
[04:22:00]  What's the ass look like?  Let me see.  It's high and tight.  Yeah.  I have a white girl's ass.  It doesn't mean it's not as...  You are very...  Like, if I was a fucking white guy, I'd be mesmerized.  You got like a very white guy body.  Dave, put your pants on.  It's not going to happen?  I'll suck you at E-Rock's chocolate cock whenever you want.  Wow.  We're trying to do a little better for the grand finale.  All right.  So everybody...  I guess it's got to be Lily.  I can't.  My wife, leave me.  Lily?  Oh, no.  No.  No, but that's not fair.  Sorry.  The idea is you guys...  I know somebody was trying to throw me under the bus, but no. 
[04:22:30]  No, I wish my girl was like in the vicinity.  If she didn't live like where she lives, I'd be like...  Well, we can set this whole scene up again.  Excuses, excuses, excuses.  Yeah, there's always...  There's always...  Pardo.  Yeah.  She's a soldier.  She wouldn't flake out like I did.  All right.  Well, Casey, thank you.  I'm sorry that we put you through this.  I'm sorry to ruin your show.  It's okay.  Bye.  It's all good.  Motherfuckers, I was really thinking I was going to take it in the poop chute.  I had no doubt that you...  You won.  You fucking kid.  Right.  But my girl was sitting there going... 
[04:23:00]  The visual was hilarious.  She was thinking...  She's like, motherfucker, I know you're not going to let this girl strap dildo for...  You out your mind.  All right.  Go around the room.  Any takers?  This is how this ends?  This was supposed to be the big girl.  This is like anticlimactic.  It really is.  In more than one way.  Anticlimactic.  Here's Dr. Z.  Dr. Z on Squirt.com.  Here you go.  Here you go.  What are you...  Dave.  Oh, Dave is doing it to himself.  Dave is doing it to himself.  Dave. 
[04:23:30]  Why are you shoving the chocolate dildo for this?  You won a finale, baby.  Dave.  What are you doing?  Dave.  This isn't fitting.  Dave.  I am a white person.  So how does it feel?  It doesn't feel that good.  It doesn't feel the way I thought it would.  Because you're doing it to yourself.  You need some lube, okay?  Yeah, get some lube.  Oh, my God.  You're not...  No!  What are you doing?  This is not how I picture this show.  See what just started.  Ow!  Don't you think.  Ow!  This is not how I picture this show ending. 
[04:24:00]  Dang you.  Oh!  Dave's...  Oh!  Dang you.  Dang.  Dang.  Look at his tiny penis.  Look at his tiny penis.  Oh, his dick is this big.  Oh, David.  Patrice.  Patrice just pulled out the fake nipple to show everybody how big your dick is.  Oh, David.  What, Patrice?  His dick is the size of a nipple.  Oh, it is.  I can't get out. 
[04:24:30]  His dick is the size of Dr. Z's nipple.  Oh, my God.  What did I do?  What did I do?  Oh, my wife was right.  Why is it hanging out of your ass?  Pull it out.  Just pull it out.  I don't want it to hurt.  Your room needs lots of lube.  Lots of lube.  What are you doing?  Why didn't you tell me that before?  Oh, that's just steak.  Guys, that's what if you all need Dr. Z on scoring.  Run at this, do it to three.  Run at this, do it to three.  Wow, wow, wow.  And now this is the proof why guys need Dr. Z on scoring.com. 
[04:25:00]  Something as simple as putting lube on.  Something that I need to sell.  Now he's sucking on the fucking black dildo.  Come on, run at this, do it to three.  Oh, God.  Run at this, do it to three.  Run at this, do it to three.  Oh, boy.  God, no.  Retreat, now you feel sorry.  Look what you're saying.  The ultimate denigration of this man by himself.  I feel nothing. 
[04:25:30]  Eastside Dave just did ass to mouth, basically, on himself.  I feel nothing.  On himself, he just did ass to mouth.  Jesus Christ.  How does he get a girl pregnant?  A girl, his lovely wife pregnant with a dick?  His dick.  He is.  You're hung like an acorn.  And I am not a fucking problem with a dick guy, but Jesus Christ.  I look, I am a grower, not a shower.  Okay.  Why do you got a bucket?  Some guys are growers.  Oh, boy.  What's happening?  Some guys are growers.  I'm a grower.  I shoved it back in my mouth.  I got some shit particles in there.  Actual shit crumbs. 
[04:26:00]  So what are you doing?  The E. coli is making its way down.  I thought I was going to throw up.  He's growing up soon.  All right, why don't you throw the black dildo away?  Because now that's useless.  We can't do anything with that.  I was kidding.  Well, I guess Dr. Z, you can put your clothes back on.  I mean, you guys are a bunch of pussies.  I think we turned this whole thing around, though.  Pussies?  It started off a little ugly, but in the end, everyone had a good time.  I just shoved the black dildo up my hand.  Lily, any words there?  Pussy.  Ron and Fez noon to three.  That's all I got.  Were you shocked by what you saw here today? 
[04:26:30]  Dave, why'd you do that?  Noon to three, Ron.  Ah, sorry.  All right.  She's trying to help out.  You know what?  Auction this off on eBay.  Dave, you finally impressed me.  You're going to be part of my trade.  Give me my trade.  Oh.  Your coochies are a little.  You got a little nappy down there, too.  It's a little.  Yeah.  She said that last time.  She likes to grow it out a little bit.  You didn't get it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A lot of people are calling you a punk, Patrice.  Give a fuck?  I didn't take it in the ass.  That's white guy shit.  As soon as you said that, I'm like, you know, Patrice is brilliant because we finally figured  out how to get her naked. 
[04:27:00]  I knew you weren't doing shit.  Getting somebody to fuck.  How do I even get in that position?  I don't even know how to get into fucking ass position.  What do I do?  Dude, if that happened, I don't think I could ever talk to you again.  Nobody could.  My girl couldn't.  My friend.  What the fuck is that?  How much shit would I talk if I took a dildo in my fucking butt cheeps?  My cheeps.  I don't even understand my butt cheeps.  Your butt cheeps.  You're speechless now.  Butt cheeps.  But guess what?  It's going to be on your mind now.  All right.  So what are we promoting today?  What have I missed out? 
[04:27:30]  Ranafez Noon to 3.  Ranafez Noon to 3.  You all right now, Dave?  I feel a little bit better.  Thank you.  So now you don't have to worry about that anymore.  Yeah.  I mean, that was a fantasy that one of them we can just strike off the ledger after today.  Yeah.  Oh, that didn't feel good, Doctor.  Well, because you did lube.  There's only one word to describe it.  That's why you guys need DrZioSquare.com.  With the hair, the blonde hair just went in there dry.  Oh, my God.  Just a dry fuck in his ass with a dildo. 
[04:28:00]  Good God.  And then he went to mouth.  Ass to mouth on himself.  ATM, baby.  ATM.  I'm going to tell you, your lower panties is making me physically ill.  I can't believe you have that unsexy of a bottom half today.  Yeah, why?  You don't like my stockings?  No, it's like almost destroys me right now.  It's freezing all the time.  Yeah, she's just trying to keep going.  Yeah, fair enough.  You know what?  Let me stop.  She's just trying to keep it warm.  You fucking anteed up and I pussied out and you're right. 
[04:28:30]  I have nothing to say.  You're absolutely right.  I'm just fucking with you.  Are you guys getting along now?  I don't want to take it home.  Would you go home with Patrice?  Would your man get mad?  He was.  She wouldn't give a fuck.  She'd just slap him in his face and tell him to shut his mouth.  Well, he has to impress me more than that.  And right now, I'm a little disappointed.  But there's a possibility.  We don't play fake radio crap.  Is there a real possibility that Patrice can bring you home to his girl?  No.  All right.  There you go.  That was honest.  No.  Racist.  No, it's nothing to do with racism. 
[04:29:00]  I'd go home with Chuck Nice.  James in Ohio.  Chuck Nice.  Mm-hmm.  You know Chuck Nice?  You would fuck Chuck Nice?  You're just saying.  Would you fuck Chuck Nice?  Would I?  Or have you?  I don't have to tell you that, do I?  He used to be part of our show.  Well, not part of our show, but he used to do our show.  Let me just say he's one of my very good friends.  The radio chick, right?  Oh, damn.  You had some Chuck Nice dick.  No, no.  I'm not saying that.  You smashed it, huh?  I'm not saying that.  You smashed Chuck Nice's.  Smashed it.  Hey, Dave, a lot of people are wondering if you pink-socked yourself. 
[04:29:30]  What does that mean?  He had to.  You had to.  When you pull it back out, now it's looking like a pink sock.  Oh, yeah.  Some of the inside have come out.  My asshole stretched.  Yeah.  He took it balls deep.  It hurt worse when I took it out than when I put it in.  What a trooper.  This nigga just stuck a black dill on his ass balls deep on his own.  What does that mean?  He went past the threshold of pain.  Well, look.  I want to help you guys out.  I'm a team player.  Ron and Fez been in the three.  I appreciate it.  What is up on the Ron and Fez show? 
[04:30:00]  Oh, we got a lot of topics coming up.  He has no idea.  No, but I heard you guys are going to do what?  Like an all-nighter?  Oh, yeah.  We're going to have a 24-hour party coming up very, very soon in the XM universe.  Stay tuned for that.  That's going to be awesome.  And what's her name?  Linnae?  Linnae, yeah.  It's a little girl.  I'm a huge fan of Linnae.  I want to steal her from you guys.  Okay.  Huge fan of her.  We have her 8x10 in our office, if you want to take her.  Well, not in that way.  I think she has some radio chops for her 11-year-old girl.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right. 
[04:30:30]  What else are we doing?  That's it, right?  Do we have to do line of the day?  Nothing's going to compare to a dildo up east like Dave Zass.  Well, maybe we should say who thinks that.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on 26 world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute snow conditions.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  Damn, bitch.  Why are you me?  I just told you a lot.  I just told you to lose 25 pounds.  Oh, God. 
[04:31:00]  A lot of people calling you a huge punk.  I don't give a fuck.  Do they really want to hear you get fucked up?  Like, what?  Like, what?  Did they lose respect?  Because I didn't take a dildo on my ass?  Well, go fuck yourself.  Fucking Cockwhite 201 from fucking Connecticut.  No, you challenged me.  You challenged me.  You didn't live up to it.  They are really mad that you didn't take a strap on them.  So they can just never...  I can never have any respect for myself. 
[04:31:30]  But I'm a liar to a quasi-sissy that took it in the ass?  Hey.  From Dr. Vicky?  Shut the fuck up.  All right.  It's drzeonscoring.com because Dr. Z rules.  Dr. Z does.  Dr. Z does.  Drzeonscoring.com.  We do like her, by the way, Patrice.  And this is...  Yeah, she's a soldier.  I actually like Patrice.  I want to say a couple things here.  Patrice, I've been encouraging Patrice to write a sex advice book.  Yeah, I think you should.  I think his take on things would make a great read. 
[04:32:00]  I like his oral technique, too.  And it would actually be very informative.  The other thing is he does a sex advice show.  Now, I don't want to blow up Patrice's spot, but for one Saturday night, one Saturday night only,  you guys should team up.  That would be some fucking radio.  I might have fun, but she...  She's goofy, I know, but...  Yeah, it'll just be like a regular girl.  She could be the girl.  You know what she could be?  Huh.  If she's around April 5th, she could be the girl on the show.  Like, I always have a woman come in just to...  Maybe she comes in for the last hour or something.  I don't give a shit.  She comes in the whole thing. 
[04:32:30]  Dr. Z is a friend of the show.  Yeah, she's cool.  Now, she's officially done more than she did on Howard.  Well, yeah.  It depends how you define it.  I mean, I wrote...  Next time, I suggest a bukkake party with you.  I think that would be nice.  Well, Howard sold about 10,000 books for me, if you can do that.  Well, because he might have...  He probably talked positive about the book.  Yeah.  Maybe we can learn from him.  Exactly.  So I'll challenge you guys.  You sell that much, and you don't know what I'm going to do.  If we sell 10,000 books, can we do bukkake party with Dr. Z? 
[04:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll challenge you.  10,000 books, bukkake party.  You lay down, and we just have guys jailed off.  10,000 books.  You know what?  She has proven herself to not be the person that's bullshit.  How much is a book?  It's about $15.  Oh, shit.  It's...  Yes.  I just have to raise $150.  $150.  $150.  $150.  $150.  And we're having a bukkake party.  And I don't think she's bullshit.  No. 
[04:33:30]  No, I'm not bullshitting.  Dr. Z.  Coming soon to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Dr. Z on scoring.  Can't wait.  All right.  Jesus.  She wants to sell books.  And suck cock.  Cocksucking bookseller.  So out there, if you guys are a fan of O.P. and Anthony, go out on Amazon.com.  We got the plugs in.  Trust me.  And order Dr. Z on scoring.  Now we're going to plug you.  Let's do a runner-up line of the day.  I don't want you to date Supertoes845.  I don't want you to date TickleDraws106. 
[04:34:00]  I don't want you to do that.  Very good.  And finally, the last runner-up line of the day.  Now Patrice has left me.  I'm just going to sit here and tell you why I'm a fast star.

It's the winner.  Okay, we're up to the winner.  Oh, Kevin, I'm sorry. 
[04:34:30]  Big Kev's doing a show Saturday night.  He came in to plug and we got busy.  You know, you should have taken the strap-on up the ass.  Yeah, no, I have a scorching case of hemorrhoids.  It wouldn't be entertaining for anyone.  But maybe my show will be tomorrow night from 9 to midnight.  Big Kev's geek stuff.  Geek stuff.  Very good.  Thank you.  Very good.  Sorry that you didn't get more.  Where are you going?  I'm coming right.  I got to piss like a motherfucker.  All right, we're running out of show anyway.  Here is your line of the day.

[04:35:30]  No!  Hey, Fez.  How are you, buddy?  Much better now that my guys had a chocolate dildo up his head.  Much better.  Thank you.  Right at Fez, noon to three.  Yeah.  I think Fez is a little pissed that that didn't happen on his fine radio show.  See, you still don't get radio there, Dave.  I'm just pissed that there was chocolate.  No one told me about it.  Yeah, exactly.  People are always hiding the candy.  Usually not there, but they're usually hiding it.  You're late.  You could have, you know, got a little action with Dr. Z there. 
[04:36:00]  Yeah, I might have to come on on the show and see what we can cook up there.  Oh, okay.  Get ready.  Wow.  All right, we're out.  Of course, Natasha.  They're turning us off.  Bye.  Bye.  The Opie and Anthony virus.  Get infected. </pre>
