<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy discussion about Charlie Sheen's erratic public behavior, focusing on his "Sheen's Corner" online broadcasts. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton analyzed Sheen's actions, arguing that his seemingly unhinged behavior was a calculated publicity stunt. They played clips from Sheen's broadcasts to support their claims, contrasting the media's portrayal of Sheen as genuinely unstable with their interpretation of it as strategic.  The discussion included profanity, vulgar comments, speculation about Sheen's drug use, the future of "Two and a Half Men," and the meaning of "moral turpitude" in relation to Sheen's firing. They also drew a comparison between Sheen and Fonzie from "Happy Days," highlighting the frequent threats that never materialized. The segment concluded with a brief mention of the death of Mike DiStefano.

The show then shifted to a more somber tone, discussing the death of comedian Mike DiStefano.  The hosts shared anecdotes about DiStefano's kind nature, contrasting him with less appreciative past guests. They detailed his success on *Last Comic Standing* and his burgeoning one-man show.  A clip played featured DiStefano recounting his struggles with heroin addiction from age 15, his abusive childhood, and subsequent criminal activities.  He also discussed his recovery and 11 years of sobriety before his unexpected death from a heart attack at 44.  Jim Norton joined the conversation, expressing his sadness and reflecting on DiStefano’s ability to connect with audiences.  Norton stated DiStefano's story inspired him to do his own one-man show.

The conversation then pivoted to a new, stricter company policy prohibiting the airing of clips depicting bodily fluids or insertion, even if already public knowledge. This frustrated the hosts, particularly regarding the inability to play audio of Brie Olson.  They argued against the rule’s absurdity, citing examples of past material that would now be prohibited.  The show returned to a discussion of Charlie Sheen, again focusing on the media's interpretation of his actions and highlighting the incongruity between the news coverage and the hosts' perception of it as a calculated performance. They also joked about Elo, a former colleague now working with Oprah, highlighting his apparent transformation. The segment ended with further discussion of the new content restrictions.

The next segment featured Patrice O'Neal as a guest.  The conversation centered on Charlie Sheen's firing from "Two and a Half Men," analyzing Sheen's behavior, finances, and the power dynamics in Hollywood, employing Mafia analogies. O'Neal suggested Sheen's actions stemmed from a feeling of being untouchable and a fear of consequences. The conversation veered into complaints about Comcast and AT&T customer service, with O'Neal detailing his confrontational calls. The discussion then shifted to a highly critical analysis of *Independence Day*, focusing on perceived shortcomings, particularly in the second half.  O'Neal frequently used offensive language and racial slurs.  The segment concluded with plugs for O'Neal's stand-up shows and new comedy CD, "Despicable."


A subsequent segment continued the harsh critique of *Independence Day*, focusing specifically on the perceived stereotypical portrayal of Judd Hirsch's character. The hosts dissected the character's dialogue, actions, and appearance using offensive language and stereotypes, then transitioned to a broader discussion of comedic portrayals and stereotypes in films like *Blazing Saddles*, *Spaceballs*, and *Tropic Thunder*.  They also discussed the NBA's Miami Heat, analyzing the team dynamics and championship chances.  The segment included promotion of Jim Norton's "Despicable" CD and stand-up shows, along with a fart joke anecdote involving Norton and Florentine. It featured a discussion of the unexpected death of Mike DiStefano, including a video tribute, "Franny's Last Ride," and a clip from a past DiStefano appearance discussing conflicts with the Laugh Factory.  Troy Kwan, a show employee, briefly appeared to address behind-the-scenes drama hinted at through coded language and speculation.

Finally, an *After Opie and Anthony Live* excerpt heavily featured Mike DiStefano.  The hosts discussed his career, confrontations with comedy club owners, and his honesty in sharing personal stories, including his wife's death.  They played audio clips of DiStefano from both *After Opie and Anthony Live* and the main show. The broadcast mentioned Avril Lavigne's presence in the SiriusXM building, contrasting the network's excitement with the somber mood surrounding DiStefano's death.  Ron Bennington joined, and the hosts discussed their upcoming projects and the success of *After Opie and Anthony Live*.  The segment included frequent vulgar language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment  and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go fuck and have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Palaver.  It's got a busy show today.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Good morning, Anthony.  Morning.  Ed.  We were just discussing Charlie Sheen.  Yeah, the Sheen thing continues.  We're trying to fade out of this whole thing.  I think everybody is.  But every day there's something to discuss. 
[00:01:30]  And it's very interesting because it gives you a look inside the mainstream media as well.  Right.  It's not just Charlie Sheen.  It's how everybody is responding and reacting to Charlie Sheen.  It gives you a look into what social media is about in this day and age and the potential of it.  Yeah.  And we were just watching these dummies on Fox Local here in New York.  Yeah.  Just completely clueless.  They don't get what Charlie Sheen's doing right now.  If you remember yesterday, me and Ant both were in agreement that his Ustream show that he did over the weekend really, really sucked. 
[00:02:00]  It was horrible.  It blew.  He was trying to do a talk show.  Right.  He was trying to do radio.  Yeah.  It's a radio show format that you can peek into.  Right.  And he was really, really bad at it.  Horrible.  And we said it, and most of the people out there said it.  So now he adjusted because he does have people around him.  Yeah.  And I think they pretty much told Charlie what we were talking about yesterday.  I'm not saying they were listening to us. 
[00:02:30]  I think it was pretty obvious.  Yeah, a lot of people were saying it.  Charlie, people aren't tuning you in to see normal Charlie Sheen.  They want to see the crazy, out-of-control Charlie Sheen.  Right.  They don't want to see him sitting there doing topics and discussing things with his cronies.  They want to see a lunatic.  They don't want to see one of those hip hats.  His hipster hat.  That the hipsters are wearing.  They don't want to see a showered Charlie Sheen.  They don't want to see a well-rested Charlie Sheen.  A two-camera shoot where it's bouncing back and forth, different angles. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  They want to see someone out of his fucking mind.  With Blair Witch camera.  Yeah.  Is he out of his fucking mind?  I don't know.  He could be manic because he's off the drugs.  He could be back on the drugs.  I don't really know.  I think it's a combo of everything, really.  So what you saw yesterday was out-of-control Charlie Sheen again.  Yeah.  Because that's what everybody wants to see, and that's what keeps the talk going.  But we're watching the dopes locally, and they're like, oh, my God, look at this guy.  Look at his hair. 
[00:03:30]  His hair is out of control.  And he's yelling at a plane that was going overhead, and he looks just completely out of his mind.  That's what he wanted you to think.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's absolutely what he was doing.  And I don't know why they can't pick up on that and discuss it in that way.  Yeah, like, no, somebody should be able to tell the news, interns, say, hey, watch that broadcast there and tell me what's going on.  Something.  But they took it literally.  They took his broadcast that he did last night literally. 
[00:04:00]  And if you do that, he looks like he's lost his mind and really needs to be institutionalized immediately.  Yeah.  But if you know the whole story, which the news should, you realize this is just another work.  But then you've got the Drudge Report.  They're showing the pictures of Charlie's crazy hair saying, look at this lunatic.  Yeah, they've got three pictures of him on Drudge, and he does look like he really needs to be institutionalized.  But yet again, the pictures are taken out of context.  He wants to look like that. 
[00:04:30]  He was trying to put on a crazy Charlie character because he was too, he was too trying to be too normal during the last broadcast.  Yeah, the normal thing isn't working.  Not working.  And him and his people realized that.  So he went over the top, and he was saying things like the news said, they actually said this.  He was just ranting and raving about planes flying overhead.  And like, it wasn't really that.  Well, he was on the phone, and he couldn't hear the speakerphone with the plane flying over. 
[00:05:00]  So he was like, oh, wait, another plane flying over.  He's like, there's a plane with noise connected to it.  Right.  Which was like the only kind of funny thing he said, a plane with noise connected to it.  And if you know what's going on, you'd realize he's not being a real crazy person.  He's being what he thinks everybody wants to see.  He's playing a character.  Right.  Although he still could be manic, but he's certainly trying to play this character.  And the mainstream media, I know they're lazy in general, but all the signs are right there. 
[00:05:30]  All you got to do is watch this Sheen's Corner, whatever it's called.  What is it called again?  That's where I'm out.  Sheen's Corner, right?  Sheen's Corner.  With a K, by the way.  And one of the clips I'm watching, he's strategizing on the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got a tweet master, because they want every tweet to kind of be crazy and say something,  maybe a catchphrase.  And then...  Fastball.  And then they're strategizing, basically admitting how bad that Ustream show was. 
[00:06:00]  And that, you know, you need to do 10-minute shows, and you need to be kind of crazy, and you need to be...  A crazy guy doesn't strategize like that.  It was all in front of you.  Right.  If you wanted to do, you know, your homework.  It's right there in front of you.  But the media just looking in, like, and saying, oh, he's got to be crazy, because he looks crazy.  But if you watch and listen to what's going on, you realize, yeah, he's planning all this out.  Also, last night's webcast that he did, Sheen's Corner...  We got a few clips.  It was only 10 minutes long. 
[00:06:30]  Which they strategized and said they were going to do.  Strategized about.  Also, pre-recorded.  Now, on the Ustream feed, it said live, but what he did was he recorded it in cam, and then just fed that through the web server, the Ustream.  So it came up saying live, but it wasn't live.  It was cut.  It was edited in a few spots.  I think what happened was he was ranting, raving, then looked back at it and took out the parts where maybe he said something that wasn't crazy, wasn't, you know, it didn't flow in with his craziness. 
[00:07:00]  So it's very calculated.  Of course it is.  The whole thing's very calculated.  It wasn't this off-the-cuff, let's turn the camera on and be wild because he's a madman.  Of course.  And then they have video of him on top of that building in L.A.  What is it, the Live Nation building?  Yeah.  And he's basically saying he's having a top-secret meeting.  Waving a machete or something?  Yeah, but the news is like, and now there's footage of him on top of a building with a machete. 
[00:07:30]  It sounds crazy.  It sounds crazy.  Live Nation isn't going to allow Charlie Sheen to go on their roof with a machete, assholes.  Unless they got some deal going.  Unless they're in on the whole thing.  Yeah.  Kind of like the Conan O'Brien thing where Conan did some, you know, crazy things.  Not like Charlie Sheen.  Yeah.  And he was drinking some mystery juice.  Yeah.  Like, they're hinting, like, is he drinking?  And does he have a machete?  Yes, of course he has a machete because we have the video.  And who's going to stop him?  No, that was all calculated too, assholes. 
[00:08:00]  The drinking thing was he wasn't showing what he was drinking because he doesn't want the label seen until people pay.  Right.  Which is smart.  Like, he's not putting anything on cam until people pay.  Yeah, because now he's realizing the social media could be very profitable.  Could have some bucks attached to it.  But the news made it look, through their clever editing, like he was hiding what he was drinking because it was booze.  Yeah, he could be drinking again.  Right.  He's not going to drink on camera.  We have no idea if he's partying again, but he's not going to do it on camera. 
[00:08:30]  He has too much to lose.  He wants to get his kids back.  And as much as he's putting on that smiley face, he is severely fucking bummed that he got knocked off two and a half men.  I'm sorry, but that is a fact.  That's the gig, and it's not like another one's coming the next day.  No.  He's got to wait this out.  He's got to prove that he isn't crazy.  He's got to build up with some acting gigs.  That's if he can.  You know, now he's just a guy that has really nothing. 
[00:09:00]  It was a cushy gig.  I was telling him, being on a sitcom, not that we would know, but you only work like half the year, and then you've got a lot of time to do whatever you want.  Yeah.  And while you're doing that sitcom, you're hauling in, what, two, two and a half million a week?  Yep.  And he has a smiley face, like, free, free at last.  It's all bullshit.  Free, free.  First of all, this is bullshit.  Good, winning, good, free.  Shut up.  I would really like to know what the winning is in this whole thing. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, where's the winning?  He's lost his kids, and he lost a great gig.  Lost his gig.  When does he win?  I don't know.  I don't know where the winning part is.  And here's another thing they're saying here.  I'm reading on Drudge Report.  It says, A Sheen Vow's lawsuit, which he did, threatens to, quote, cut their throats.  Now, that was another one of his ranting, rambling things that he was doing, that crazy Charlie was doing.  Yeah.  But it was, he didn't mean cut the throats of the people that he was working for. 
[00:10:00]  It was an abstract, like, the trolls, an abstract of people that are not with Charlie kind of a thing.  But the way they present it, again, the news and mainstream media.  He might murder somebody.  It's a better story.  Yeah.  It's a better story if this isn't a Charlie Sheen work.  Right.  If he's really crazy.  Hey, should we check our contracts for moral turpitude, by the way?  Moral turpitude?  That's a scary one. 
[00:10:30]  I didn't know you could get fired for moral turpitude.  Moral turpitude.  That's what they got him on.  Moral turpitude.  Damn.  What is turpitude?  Some committing a felony.  You got some bad turpitude.  I'll tell you one thing.  I got a bad turpitude.  They're telling me I got a bad turpitude.  Turpitude.  Whatever, dude.  Winning turpitude.  I understand a bad attitude, but a bad turpitude.  Turpitude.  That sounds really scary.  What the fuck is turpitude?  They got him on moral turpitude. 
[00:11:00]  Turpitude.  Duh.  Turpitude.  Duh.  Duh.  Turpitude.  Turpitude.  But most of this is a work.  Can he start partying again at any moment?  Yes.  Yeah.  But right now, this is a work.  And the media just doesn't fucking see it.  And that's why he keeps going, because they just, they don't blow it off as just, oh,  look, this guy has got to be, he's displaying self-destructive behavior because losing the 
[00:11:30]  kids, losing his gig, this whole thing where he can't keep a chick and the fights and drug  things in hotels that he's been through.  He's displayed that self-destructive shit.  And this is a prime example.  So he does have that really going for him.  That's the real part of it.  Yeah, he's not completely sane.  But right, right.  But this whole completely crazy hair fucking flying like a wild man yelling into one video  camera that's five inches from his face, it's calculated. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, Charlie knows how to film himself.  He's been around a while.  That video of him where you see the camera coming up from the table, from underneath the  table, that's a horrible angle for anybody.  Right.  And he knows that.  And then you turn on your lighter and you're smoking into it and then you put the tip of  the cigarette right next to the camera lens.  That's all fucking weird, scary shit.  Yeah, it's weird stuff.  It's weirdness.  Right.  And that's exactly what he's going for.  Why would he put the camera underneath the table? 
[00:12:30]  He's that crazy?  Yeah, when just over the weekend, he had the cameras on some kind of a tripod or it was  a webcam on a laptop that was on a surface.  So he wasn't doing the crazy Charlie cam.  And then during that video, he's talking to one of his guys in Strategize.  Yeah, yeah.  And the guy's like, you really need a really good tweet to start the morning.  Yeah.  Like they all are aware of the attention he's getting. 
[00:13:00]  No real spontaneity there.  No, he's like, you really got to think about the next tweet.  It's got to be a really good one.  Yeah.  He's like, I just woke up.  And then, I don't know, the guy said something about orange juice or something.  He's like, orange juice?  I'm not tweeting about orange juice.  And meanwhile, it was.  It was like at 7 o'clock Pacific time.  Last night's show?  Last night is when it was broadcast.  But you could tell.  Oh, no, I'm talking about the one I saw on YouTube.  Oh, the one you saw.  Yeah, the one under the table where they were strategizing.  Oh, that one.  Well, that one, too, I believe, was recorded. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That one was definitely recorded.  Oh, yeah, because there were cuts in it.  And you could tell, like, that they're recorded and edited.  And he's not, the times don't line up.  It's supposed to be nighttime, but he's talking about lunch and what meeting he has to take at 1 p.m.  Meanwhile, that's over already.  So all of it, like you said, is right there in front of everybody.  And I like the take. 
[00:14:00]  You said what it is, his violence and what he's going to be doing to people.  Yeah, there's a Fonzie thing happening here.  It's all Fonzie.  With Charlie Sheen, you know, he's threatening everybody.  He's going to cut this guy's throat.  He doesn't mean literally.  Check it.  And, you know.  Beware.  Beware, trolls.  The trolls, all that shit.  He's got to now do something because we're all waiting now.  Okay.  But it's like Fonzie where he's like, you know, oh, look out for Fonz.  But you never saw him beat anybody up.  Right.  The whole time.  So Charlie can't keep threatening.  And now he has to act or the threats start to sound really, really silly. 
[00:14:30]  Somebody's, Steve on Long Island.  We don't have time to go to you right now.  He goes, do you guys really think he's going to recover?  Well, he obviously needs help.  Yeah, he does need some.  I'm not saying what kind of help he needs right now.  We're not saying he's completely sane.  But he's also smart enough to really play this to the media and the people out there.  He's putting on a get-me-in-a-straight-jacket crazy Charlie Sheen.  That's what he's putting on.  And that's what some of the mainstream media is buying into. 
[00:15:00]  And he's not at that level.  No.  He's not at that point at all.  He's got problems and issues that I think he's had for years and years and years.  Right.  He's successfully done TV shows during these issues that he's had and everything.  And I think he's seeing this opportunity to play this crazy guy on this webcast.  I think he's seeing a way to try to monetize it.  Not that he's going to monetize it to the extent that he would if he just would have stayed on the fucking show.  But that's what he's doing. 
[00:15:30]  And that show only had two years left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now he would have banked a shitload of money and then he could have moved on with whatever he wants.  Yeah.  Do whatever he wants then.  But there's nothing to move on to at this point.  Major League 3?  I get douche chills every time he mentions it.  He might have gotten another show.  Who wants to see Major League 3?  I know.  Danny.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  Charlie Sheen.  Why don't we play a couple of these?  Sheen's Corner Episode 2.  We just got some highlights. 
[00:16:00]  And you know what?  Let's listen to it and try to interpret it as the mainstream media would.  Right.  And then what it really was.  Well, he has to.  It really is just Charlie trying to be crazy.  First clip he has to admit that his Ustream show sucked a dick.  Right.  Am I going on tonight?  I don't know.  I got to get a tweet out there and let him know that.  Oh, okay.  This is him strategizing.  Now, this isn't from last night's show?  No.  Okay.  No.  There was something that he recorded this while we were on yesterday. 
[00:16:30]  Well, this became aware while we were on yesterday morning.  And we just didn't have time to go to it.  And he's strategizing, proving our point.  Yeah.  That he's aware.  He's aware.  Okay, what can we do next that keeps the interest up?  Am I going on tonight?  I don't know.  I got to get a tweet out there and let him know that last night was a shameful train wreck  filled with, like, blind, cuddly puppies.  A shameful train wreck filled with blind, cuddly puppies.  Don't acknowledge that. 
[00:17:00]  Fuck.  Last night you had a blast.  You had fun.  And you plan to make it more fun.  Something like that.  Think positive.  Fuck.  Don't address any of the bad press.  Don't address any of the boring, don't jokes like that.  Exactly.  Because here's the truth.  You want the truth?  I tried to use their format.  I don't fit into their format.  Their format is shit.  Their format is cat shit.  Their format is cat shit stuck to the bottom of my sprinting shoe.  Of my world record breaking sprinting perfect platinum Nike. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  I agree.  See, and now he's making fun of the people that know how to do a Ustream show.  Yeah.  Know how to do a podcast.  Know how to do radio.  It's that format, you know, like getting on the medium, whichever it is that you choose,  and being interesting and or compelling and entertaining.  The fact is you don't know what the fuck you're doing, Charlie Sheen.  That's the format.  Sorry, but you don't know what the fuck you're doing.  You're a very confused guy as far as putting a show together. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  So obviously he had to admit that it sucked.  He didn't think it sucked, by the way.  No, no, no.  After the fact, when he saw the critiques coming in, he goes, oh, fuck, they really hated it.  He thought it was great.  So now I've got to spin this thing in my favor.  He thought it was great.  And here they go strategizing the next tweet.  When a lot of people out there are thinking, wow, what is he going to tweet next?  He's crazy.  Dream of unconsciousness.  Yeah, just coming out of his brain, out of nowhere.  Insane Sheen. 
[00:18:30]  But this is what really is going on.  Hey, give me a tweet that has nothing to do with Sheen's Corner just to start the day.  Tell somebody that you spilled your orange juice in your kitchen.  I don't care what you say.  Just let's start people off without talking about that.  Let's get into that later.  That would imply that I care about orange juice and I have a kitchen.  Let's talk about the magic tray.  There you go.  There you go.  There you go.  The magic tray is filled with magic, period, the end.  You're lucky when it's revealed to you.  You're lucky if you can touch it.  You're lucky if you can say the words magic tray.  What? 
[00:19:00]  Gah.  Gah.  Foiled again.  Hello, are you there?  We need to hack up the person responsible for this bad connection.  Hack him up into pieces in front of his children.  He's crazy.  And then he's talking about hacking people up in front of the children.  That crazy Charlie Sheen.  Just keep in mind, once again, Fonzie.  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of threats going on.  When are we going to see one of these threats come true? 
[00:19:30]  But nothing really happening.  Nothing really happening.  He wants to chop children up.  He's threatening to cut this guy's throat.  But he's really, the threats are based on that.  And his threat there was to the guy in charge of the connection.  Yeah.  So, like, who is that?  Who is that?  Who is that crazy Charlie?  That now has to hide under a bed.  Who is that crazy Charlie?  Yeah, come on, crazy Charlie.  Who is that?  But the news would be like, he's been threatening to chop people up.  He's threatening to kill people.  Not really.  Call him out on it.  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Call him out.  Like, no one called out Fonzie.  Yeah, no one called out the Fonz.  You never saw Fonzie fight.  Hey, watch it.  Look out.  But Fonzie's here.  And you're like, um, Fonz, you never, you never punched anyone.  Yeah.  You never saw the, whoa.  Yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah.  And then the audience would go, ooh.  Oh, here it comes.  And then you'd have to, like, maybe Cunningham would turn to the audience and say something  like, hey, people, he's never punched anyone.  Someone had to call out Fonzie.  And then you hear something like, some clamoring in the audience. 
[00:20:30]  And he's like, Cunningham.  Yeah.  And he goes, go ahead, hit me, Fonzie.  Hey.  Right.  And then he'd have to leave Arnold's because he just looks silly.  And then say something like, next time.  Yeah.  Hey.  You wait till next time.  We got that going on with Charlie.  That's Charlie Sheen Fonzie.  A lot of threats going absolutely nowhere.  Charlie Fonzie Sheen.  It's nice to watch the entire country getting sick of him at the same time.  Who are you?  Jim.  Hi, Jim.  Hi.  I just can't just listen to Charlie Sheen clips without a fucking comment. 
[00:21:00]  The whole country is tired of this guy already, me included.  And I defend him.  He's an asshole.  Yeah.  He's an asshole.  Are you seeing this as a complete work?  No.  He's not.  He's just crazy.  And he can't believe that he blew it.  I don't think he's as crazy as he wants to come off.  Yeah.  No, he's not.  He's not legally insane.  He's just a boob.  And he overplayed his hand.  Yes.  He's overplayed it.  Very good.  And now he's playing this new character that he thinks, you know, people think he is.  Right.  You know?  Yeah.  There's definitely some craziness here.  Yeah.  But not as crazy as these clips would make you think. 
[00:21:30]  But he's playing this character at the cost of losing his kids, his gig, his chick, whatever  it is.  Yeah.  Like he's losing everything.  There's no winning going on.  I'll tell you right now, rumors about a reality show, that would be the biggest mistake.  Because this guy can't do anything.  No.  He can't do anything.  He needs his kids back.  He can do.  What is he going to do?  He can...  Here's what he can do.  He can take a script and be directed and do an act. 
[00:22:00]  He's an actor.  He's a Hollywood actor.  Most of which are not very entertaining people when they're not reading other people's words  and standing where other people tell him to stand.  In front of things that other people built.  This will be a complete bust by Friday.  Yeah.  And then it'll lead to him having to go back to doing coke, by the way.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Once the attention starts getting off of him, it'll be like...  Oh, yeah. 
[00:22:30]  And then it'll be too late.  Look, no.  Here I am on my Ustream doing coke for you.  Oh, geez.  Too late, Charlie.  Just blasting rails on his desk.  Too late.  He's making a fool out of himself.  He really is.  Yes, exactly.  Now he's just making a fool out of himself.  Viacom fired Tom Cruise.  Like, those guys, man, you can do what you do, but to just continually motherfuck them  and the...  Somebody theorized to me, I wonder if the Ustream show got him fired.  I wonder if CBS was sitting on waiting, a reason to fire him so they don't have to pay 
[00:23:00]  him, and maybe contractually he's not allowed to do another broadcast, and when he called  it Sheen's Corner, or whatever it was, that might have fucking given them legal reason  to fire him.  Well, they said it was for...  They were just sitting back.  Oh, well, they got the...  Do you think they wanted to forgive him, or do you think they were waiting for him  to fuck up?  I think they were...  Because Charlie wasn't completely going after them.  He kept it in that range.  We were talking about this last week.  He kept it in that range where he could put all the pieces back together and get back  on two and a half men.  And Warner Brothers was doing the same thing. 
[00:23:30]  They were kind of just sitting there like, which way is this going to go?  And then they finally said, fuck this, we're done with him, and then I agree with you,  Jimmy, where they were trying to figure out what they could fire him for.  Do you think if he had just shut up after a few days and stopped...  Yeah, he would have been back.  He would have been okay, right?  Yeah, I think so.  I think if he quietly would have met with them and been like, yeah, look, I was just blowing  off some steam, whatever.  I'm detoxing.  I'm coming off drugs.  I'm a little loopy and fucking crazy. 
[00:24:00]  They would have absolutely brought him back.  There was a period of time where it could have went either way.  Warner Brothers was holding out, because let's be honest, that show made a shitload of money  for a lot of people, they didn't want to just blow it off, and Charlie wasn't sure what  he wanted to do.  So he went after the creator, but not in a way where they couldn't fix it.  And they got him for moral turpitude.  Moral turpitude is what they got him for.  I wonder if the Jewish stuff got him, because when you start, he was calling the guy by his  real Jewish name, and then there was that weird text, and it's like, man, Hollywood, 
[00:24:30]  they're tired of the anti-Semitism.  They don't play games with that stuff.  Yeah.  I don't know if that did it, but...  His excuse was...  And also, maybe they were negotiating with somebody else, going, you know, we could get  this show back on the air with somebody else.  Well, that's what they were thinking of doing.  So maybe they were thinking that strategy out, too.  I've heard Jim J. Bullock.  Oh, God.  Who was that one guy that was in every sitcom?  Ted McKinley.  Ted McGinley.  McGinley.  Oh, McGinley will take him out. 
[00:25:00]  He'll be perfect.  Yeah, Bob.  He's sitting around waiting for his phone to ring.  And John Cryer.  I've got a bad feeling about this show.  And no one's talking about John Cryer.  That guy's got to be on Suicide Watch.  Why isn't anybody talking to him?  Huh?  Why isn't anybody talking to him?  Because he's sitting at home praying that they're going to keep this show together somehow.  And they will.  I don't know.  Most likely it won't be successful.  But they'll get another season out of it.  Someone different?  Or Darren Stevens?  I'm wondering what they're going to do.  No, they're going to have to go with Charlie's move to wherever. 
[00:25:30]  And they'll take the fake phone call from Charlie Sheen's character.  And here's his brother because the kid still needs parenting even though the kid's 30 now.  They'll make fun of it, though.  Maybe the kid will be one of the men and they'll just get a new kid.  And it's still two and a half men because the kid is like a man now anyway.  Because there's some egos involved, too.  And I bet you there's a bunch of people that want to go, oh, really, Charlie?  This show is going to continue to be successful without you.  Without you.  The odds of that happening, you've got to be honest, that's going to be a tough one. 
[00:26:00]  But they're going to try.  Yeah.  They'll try for at least a year because everybody will tune that show in.  Yeah.  I bet you are.  Yeah.  They'll make fun of the fact that he went off the deep end.  Like they'll somehow reference it with a phone call or something.  They'll make fun of it, though.  You have to in this day and age because everyone has the information.  Four years ago, you could do Darren Stevens, but now you just can't pull it off anymore.  No, you can't do a Darren Stevens.  Right.  Just plop a new guy in the character.  No.  But, yeah, he's not winning.  And when he said free at last, no one wants to give up a two and a half million dollar a week gig. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Or you could have negotiated an out or something.  Yeah.  Sheen's Corner, episode three.  So this is the one you saw last night.  I did not see this.  This was the one with the real just ranting and rambling.  And it's so...  So we took our advice.  Yes.  We said the only reason people are following his Twitter and watching these videos is because they want to see crazy, out of control Charlie Sheen.  Crazy Charlie.  But he can't officially be that, but he can play that as a character. 
[00:27:00]  Yes.  He was making faces.  His hair was so fucked up, and he had the camera in a certain way where it looked really fucked up, and the light on him made him overexposed on his face, so he really looked pale.  Can we take a moment to just realize how smart we are?  Okay.  Take a moment.  Just think about how smart we are.  A moment of silence about how smart we are.  I'd like more than a moment, actually.  Oh, okay. 
[00:27:30]  That's exactly what we said yesterday he needs to do.  We're seers again.  This is, we said, crazy Charlie.  That's the only reason why people are interested.  Most people are hoping that he ODs, to be quite frank with you.  Yeah, true.  They don't know him as a person.  They don't care.  Fuck, I want to ride this right to the point where they pull the body bag out of his house.  Destruction, yeah.  They don't give a fuck.  They don't want to see this guy clean.  They want to see crazy Charlie right to the end.  I'm embarrassed for him at this point.  You are, right?  And not because I think he's too nuts for kids or anything, but it's almost like you're 
[00:28:00]  watching a guy trying too hard.  He's trying way too hard.  Conan had a funny tweet about Fonzie.  He said, it has to be said, but something about Fonzie's phrase, sit on it, did not age  well.  And I laughed at that, but that's what this stuff is not already, it's already seemed kind  of corny.  It's very corny.  It was wacky when you first said it, but now that it's your thing, it's dull.  Yeah, saying the lines over and over again.  It was also wacky because you really bought into it. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  But without an actual threat happening, it just sounds silly every time he threatens  somebody.  And then he realizes, when he was doing those catchphrases, at first I think they really  just came off the top of his head.  Right.  And now he's like, oh, they're digging catchphrases.  I got to come up with a new catchphrase every 10 minutes.  Fastball, fastball, fastball.  And there's a lot of fucking swing.  Winning.  A lot of swing and a miss catchphrases happening.  A lot of bad ones.  That's what we should do today.  Maybe go to the phones and all the catchphrases that didn't stick. 
[00:29:00]  Flounder swimming.  No.  No.  Sorry, Charlie.  That's not going to fit on a t-shirt.  Hat in a clout.  No.  Sorry.  Yeah.  No.  Rambunctious.  That's a winner.  Rambunctious.  We like that.  Because who hasn't been saying winning a million times?  That was great, but that was very organic.  It just kind of happened.  That's good.  Rape.  Rape.  Cool.  Rape.  Cool.  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Rape.  Cool.  All right.  Let's play the highlights from Sheen's Corner, Episode 3. 
[00:29:30]  Sheen's guy's ass about writing a tweet for him.  Okay.  First thing.  I'm getting ready to do the tweet to Meredith.  Okay.  It's morning there.  You spelled it D-E-H.  Is there an I in there?  Is it really Meredith?  I'm just...  I forwarded you exactly how she spelled it.  If she doesn't know how to spell her own name, then she loses.  Oops.  Bye-bye.  Okay.  We love you Meredith.  That's it.  Okay.  Next.  Excuse me.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  No.  I'm okay.  I'm going to...  Maspugaccio.  Where are you?  In Italyville?  Huh?  Are you in Italyville still?  Yeah.  I'm on Rome.  And people are giving me...  What are you talking about, Willis?  He just starts doing catchphrases that are out there already.  Oh, Cousin Larry.  Jimmy nailed it, though. 
[00:30:30]  He's trying way too hard now.  Like, oh, God, it's douchey.  You're embarrassed for him.  I'm kind of embarrassed.  I'm embarrassed for him.  Sorry.  Keep your nose with a rubber hose.  Duh.  Tweet it.  Text it.  Dino-mite.  God, a publicist really did do him well.  Dino-mite.  He really needed somebody standing in front of him as a barricade to keep his idiocy in.  Yeah.  Who's this guy?  Like, does he have any credibility in Hollywood?  Or is it just one of his friends trying to take it on? 
[00:31:00]  I'm guessing about your assistant.  Yeah, it's in his Twitter follow who he's following.  It's like the bot.  It's like the first guy he followed.  I guess we're trolls because we're not Team Sheen anymore.  Sorry.  I was in it first.  I was like, wow, this is pretty crazy stuff.  But now it's...  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  They talk about their deal with interns.  Charlie says crazy things.  Of course.  And crazy is an exclamation point.  Oh, yeah, of course.  So maybe not too crazy, huh?  Maybe not, really. 
[00:31:30]  All right, listen to this next clip with what Jimmy said.  Trying too hard.  Yeah.  There's a douche chillness to it.  It's embarrassing.  It's like when you tell someone they're funny.  You ever tell someone they're funny who's not a comic or in the business like a relative?  And then for the rest of the night they try to make you laugh?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what this is like.  Where you tell someone they have a good voice and then they continue to sing in the car when you were only being polite?  Oh, no.  But I really believed that.  No, I didn't mean you.  But I really believed it when you said that, Jimmy.  Well, I thought you could sing.  I heard you humming a little bit. 
[00:32:00]  We were in the shower.  Was I going to not be polite?  Duh.  Nano, nano.  Duh.  Pat from Anaki keeps them coming.  Fuck.  I wish I could take credit for this one.  Coke logic.  Where's the beef?  Duh.  Where's the beef?  You know, I've fallen and I can't get up.  You know what I'm saying.  Hey, Charlie, you're a joke.  That's what we're saying today.  Not buying it.  Sorry. 
[00:32:30]  Joke.  Where's the beef?  It's funny.  You look crazy wild.  Time to make the donuts.  Winning.  Winning.  Time to make the donuts.  Jason in Tampa.  Fuck.  I want to be coming up with these myself.  Why am I reading?  I can think of this shit.  They're great.  You look marvelous.  Duh.  Duh.  Could you dig that?  I knew that you could.  I knew that you could.  I knew that you could.  Here's one.  Where are we going? 
[00:33:00]  Where are we going?  Oh, fuck.  That's hilarious.  Charlie.  What is he doing?  He's trying much to us.  It isn't like they fucked with him and did anything.  And it's hard to.  You didn't want to defend networks.  You never.  But what are they?  They didn't.  He had a gig.  Right.  And he put himself in a tough position because maybe part of him is like, you know what?  Fuck it.  I'll just party on cam now.  But he can't because of the kids thing.  So he's in this weird fucking quandary. 
[00:33:30]  So he's got a fake that he might be on coke and drinking.  Because I really think he's trying to stay sober at this moment.  Right.  But it could change at any moment.  As you know, Jim.  Yeah.  It's a tough one.  Yeah.  They talk about.  Okay.  The crazy stuff from Charlie.  Well, I nailed this deal with interns.com.  Yeah.  And?  Brilliant.  Please look at the email so that you can give the go ahead because they want the tweet  at before one o'clock today.  Okay.  Okay.  That gives us like 6,000 hours. 
[00:34:00]  See, the tweets are calculated when they want them.  It's got to be by a certain time.  Right.  This is that intern.com site.  What happened to just off the cuff tweeting?  That was kind of enjoyable at first.  But there were rumors right from the get-go that there was somebody behind his Twitter  really, really helping him out.  Looking good.  Duh.  Steve Yu from Buffalo.  Time to pump you up.  Duh.  Tiger blood. 
[00:34:30]  Pumping you up.  Pump you up.  You're a dope, Charlie.  Like 6,000 hours.  Record breaker.  Dude, it's a record breaker.  Okay, good.  What is it?  Under Guinness.  It's 8-6 figures, okay?  Okay, great.  Great, great.  Well, as it should be, duh, we're still getting jipped.  Have you had your breakfast yet, my friend?  No, I'm smoking a cigarette and drinking something I won't reveal.  Unless they pay me.  You can get home and, like, you know, give me a big hug and avoid some eye contact. 
[00:35:00]  All right, I'll be there to kiss both cheeks and give you a big hug.  Would that be facial or buttle?  Facial or buttle?  Say that again?  Would that be facial or buttle?  I'm a facial.  Okay, we'll start in the facial area.  He's a real fucking bore, huh?  And the guy at the other end of the line is very telling.  He doesn't think Charlie's crazy.  He's laughing at his silly new character. 
[00:35:30]  He's just like, what are you doing?  Anthony, you want to go with kiss my grits?  Where was the other one?  Come on, there was another one.  Kiss my grits.  Where the fuck was the other one?  Winning, winning grits.  Kiss them.  I'm a wild and crazy guy.  Oh, God, it's embarrassing, man.  Charlie, I don't understand.  Well, then you might be a redneck. 
[00:36:00]  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  Isn't that special?  Waddle doodle.  Waddle doodle.  Duh.  To the moon, Alice.  Duh.  To the moon.  Oh, shit.  It's like I always say, pardon me, do you have any grape upon?  He's the worst now.  This is him trying way too hard. 
[00:36:30]  Charlie is a joke.  Let's make a noise up there in the air.  Oh, de plane.  De plane.  De plane.  Winning.  Sock it to you.  Jason, thank you, Tampa.  Goal.  A-bomb from A-Rod, man. 
[00:37:00]  Don't tase me, bro.  They're coming in way too fast now.  There's a book-em, Dan-o.  A book-em, Dan-o.  Duh, Papa Booey.  And Mike in Hoboken.  I don't have time to go to the phones.  It's too crazy right now.  But he writes, Rachel.  You know that.  Rachel.  It's one of your classic lines, right?  Oh.  Rachel. 
[00:37:30]  You've come back.  Yeah.  Winning.  Did we do Get Her Done?  We did, right?  No, not yet.  Get Her Done.  Got to make sure that we get them all out.  Crazy Charlie talks about his crazy new book.  Oh, shit.  It's insane.  Well, but, you know, I'm going to reach out to who's the founder of Amazon?  Jeff Bezos.  Is that his name?  Yep.  Yeah, I'm going to reach out to him because I think we should do my book. 
[00:38:00]  Incidentally, the title, best title of all time, Apocalypse Me.  The Jaws of Life.  Should I get Bezos on the phone?  That's exactly the reaction you should have got, Charlie.  Nothing.  From your own guy that kisses your ass.  Apocalypse Me.  The Jaws of Life.  Is that what he said?  See, it's just.  That's crazy.  It's crazy because it doesn't even make sense.  It's brilliant, right?  Because Charlie said.  It's brilliant.  Oh.  Jesus Christ.  I'll be back.  Go with Monster Rain for a title or something. 
[00:38:30]  Apocalypse Me.  The Jaws of Life.  Should I get Bezos on the phone?  Apocalypse Me.  The Jaws.  He heard you.  I know, man.  The repeating of it is.  Because he.  Oh, it's douchey.  He's mad that he didn't get the reaction.  No.  Me.  The Jaws.  The Jaws of Life.  That was brilliant.  You should see the images.  Yeah, get him to call me today because I'm going to sell this thing through Amazon and 
[00:39:00]  through Kindle.  That way we save a bunch of trees because they give us our oxygen, face it, right?  And we love trees.  Must keep as money around as we can.  Must maybe even marry a tree.  Marry a tree because, you know, the other type of marriage for me didn't work.  So I'm just going to marry a tree.  Yeah, see, that's not going to trend.  Marry a tree won't trend today, Charlie.  Marry a tree.  I'm sorry.  Another swing and a miss.  You won't be seeing hashtag marry a tree.  No, Charlie.  Sorry.  Another fucking miss.  That's his stream of consciousness.  Yeah, it's his crazy talk from Charlie.  It's like Charlie Manson is what he's doing. 
[00:39:30]  See, what's going to end up having.  Helter Skelter.  Helter Skelter.  He's going to have to go back on the fucking coke to get the real craziness back out.  Yeah.  He's trying to be like a wacky Colonel Kurtz.  Yeah, yeah.  Like he's an oracle.  Like just this larger than life figure.  It really is.  Who says things that just reach people in a weird way.  Yeah.  But that's not what's happening.  No one's being reached.  Well, at first. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, I think it's a snail crawling on the edge of a straight razor.  It's exactly, you know.  Hey, are you an assassin, Willard?  You're a grocery clerk sent to collect a bill.  But he reminds me of a guy who's trying to be a stream of consciousness, random genius.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Because he founded Amazon, didn't he?  Like just a random genius.  Yeah, yeah.  It's so fucking douchey.  Oh, boy. 
[00:40:30]  And more importantly, I'd love to get booked on his podcast.  Oh, of course.  I'd love to.  But he's not going to do a podcast anymore because he can't do it.  So then he makes fun of all the people that can.  Oh, he's going to do it.  I said yesterday.  Ten minutes.  Our listeners do better podcasts than Charlie Sheen did.  I've checked out a bunch of them.  And there's some guys, you know, trying and doing all right with it.  Oh, my God.  So then he has to make fun of people that actually know how to fucking do that shit.  Yeah.  I'm the Sheen's Corner Fugitive. 
[00:41:00]  Winning.  Winning.  Look for me.  When Charlie says something crazy that starts with a hashtag, you might know me because I  married a tree.  And I'm crazy.  I am the fugitive.  The fugitive.  I was thinking Breitbart should pick up this audio today.  Because no one has this angle.  They're all still buying into it.  That he actually might have snuck on a roof somewhere in L.A. with a machete. 
[00:41:30]  Stop.  Shut the fuck up.  He's trying so fucking hard.  We got one more clip from Charlie Sheen's Corner, episode three.  This is where he talks to Billy Bush on the phone about getting fired.  Oh.  So this is exclusive.  Yeah, this is good.  You think he's going to talk normally here or he's going to?  It's going to be crazy, Sheen.  Crazy, Sheen.  And you think Billy Bush will play his role or will he step out of his role and go, look,  Charlie, stop.  You're trying too hard. 
[00:42:00]  And this is just silly talk that's not really crazy at all.  Let's see.  I have no idea.  Charles, your reaction to what is this?  Warner Brothers has fired you.  Yeah, well, whatever.  You know, I guess if you can't process a guy or realize his value, you must terminate him.  It's so juvenile.  It is the work of infants.  With extreme prejudice.  Terminate with extreme prejudice.  Which guy is this?  This is in between Sheen.  In between, you call it?  In between Sheen.  So many layers of this guy.  He's crazy.  So many layers.  But he's really calculated. 
[00:42:30]  This is crazy, Charlie, who realizes the gig he blew up.  Because he was riding this right back to, look, let's get this back together.  Now he's like, oh, fuck.  This is a cinder block of reality in your face, Sheen.  And then he can't even do a podcast properly.  So he's really fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is the work of silly infants.  And it's just, if this is what it had to come to to get me out of those silly shirts,  then so be it. 
[00:43:00]  Did you find out that it was like today, within a couple hours ago, or would it?  No, I found out like five minutes ago.  How did you find out?  I guess I got a text or something.  But you know what?  Here's another thing.  He's got these yellow cockroaches that they didn't even have the decency to call me.  I put five bill in their cheap suit pockets.  It's just deplorable.  And they should be ashamed of themselves.  That's how it always goes down.  When they're done with you, they're done with you.  This didn't sound like completely off the cuff, wild, rambling, Charlie.  What happened?  This is a maniac who is somehow thinly veiling that he's devastated that he's been fired 
[00:43:30]  from a $2 million a week job.  This is wacky guy realizing that he has blown an $8 million a month job.  This is almost like this.  Hi, Charlie. 
[00:44:00]  It's Bob Eatman.  It doesn't look good.  That sex for Sam thing didn't go over too well.  Don't care.  Don't care.  Good.  Good.  What are we going to do about it?  Don't care.  Winning.  Winning.  I really like that.  What are we going to do for two years?  I was thinking the same thing yesterday.  You always feel like you're winning until you get the call and go, oh, what the fuck? 
[00:44:30]  I'm fired?  Right.  What?  How dare they?  And then there's a lot of tears.  Do you know how hard it is to have the number one comedy on television?  Oh, shit.  That's really fucking hard, man.  Yeah.  It doesn't happen often, huh, Jimmy?  No.  It doesn't happen to a lot of people.  Who's had two?  Imagine Seinfeld fucking up this bed in the middle of when he was top of the game.  Kelsey Grammer, I think you're right.  Kelsey Grammer was.  Yeah, you're right.  Kelsey Grammer.  Probably had two.  Yeah, he's right.  It was from a spinoff.  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  I don't even know.  I don't even know who else would be there.  But it's very, very, I didn't even think Kelsey Grammer.  It's very rare.  He wanted to get this whole thing back together.  Oh, God, dude.  He's a guy who dared his girlfriend to fuck somebody else.  Go ahead, I dare you.  And she finally did.  Yep.  Yeah.  And that's what he's facing.  And she can't unfuck the guy.  It cannot be undone.  And that's what the firing is.  I wouldn't be surprised if we get a story soon that he's,  you know, partying again and has an out-of-control moment again.  Because now he has nothing to lose.  Yeah, because this is, you know.  Because he was really trying to, he realized, 
[00:45:30]  ah, fuck, I took it too far.  I got to get my shit together.  But in the meantime, I'm going to have a little fun with this.  And then they yanked him anyway.  And now he has nothing to lose.  He's not getting his kids back anytime soon.  They've got to figure that out, right?  Yeah, well, he has custody thing.  So here's the rest of that clip.  It's just deplorable.  And they should be ashamed of themselves.  Did you not see this coming?  I kind of sensed it.  My diamond was leading toward that.  But I don't know that, I thought they'd be this foolish.  But clearly they are. 
[00:46:00]  It seems to me the show is not canceled, though.  I mean, they're going to try and replace you, aren't they?  Yeah, no, they can try all they want.  But it'll be a different show.  I'm sure it'll be fine.  Whatever.  People will tune in for, like, the first one.  I'm more worried about my children right now than any of this nonsense, you know.  So, yeah, they are going to probably go on with the show.  And they're going to just try to squeeze the last bit of money out of it.  Right.  They're aware that they're fucked, too.  But they'll probably get a good year out of it, maybe two, if they're lucky.  They'll have a big meeting with the sales staff that has to sell the time. 
[00:46:30]  And it'll be like, just, you know, go with the whole thing.  Like, all the publicity around Charlie Sheen, that's still attached to the show.  And we'll squeeze a little more money out.  And then we'll move on.  You know, the ratings will be massively huge at first, because of the curiosity of what are they doing with the show without Charlie.  And then it'll drop off drastically and quickly.  And then the show will go away.  But they'll make another, you know, boatload of money off it.  Winning.  This might be a bad example, but MASH survived after season three. 
[00:47:00]  Now, this has been much longer.  But after season three, McClane Stephenson left, they survived Trapper John leaving.  They survived Frank Burns leaving.  They, uh, uh, what else survived a big, uh, Cheers survived, Shelley Long leaving.  But when you have an ensemble cast that has so many personalities in it.  That's true.  Like MASH, I mean, you know, as long as they had Alan Alda on there and he had a foil and, uh.  John Cryer's no Alan Alda.  No.  No.  Yes.  No. 
[00:47:30]  But, you know, other shows have survived.  I don't think this one will, by the way.  No.  I was just making an example.  No, I don't think so either.  I think there'll be a huge spike in ratings at the beginning of the season.  Then it'll drop off week to week until they have to cancel it.  The graph will completely, um, mirror whatever this Charlie Sheen thing does.  Right.  A big spike up and a big spike down.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if, uh, Charlie goes into an actual rehab in the near future.  He's so dead set against it.  I understand that. 
[00:48:00]  I mean, we've heard crazy Charlie talk about that.  I don't want to deal with that, but, but now it's like he's got to prove himself to Hollywood again.  Yeah.  Hey, do your homework.  Oh, somebody's trying out for the role.  Are you trying out for two and a half men, Jimmy?  That would be good.  Maybe.  Maybe.  We could get you some lines, maybe.  Yeah.  What, Coke?  Yeah, you're going to need that.  I banged a stripper there once.  Tuscaloosa.  Ah, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:48:30]  That was good.  That was good.  Don't ask him.  He sounds gay.  That's edgy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  John Crier.  John Crier.  Beam me up.  The catchphrase is still coming in there.  Beam me up.  Beam me up.  Oh, duh.  Beam me up to my next gig.  Duh.  He kind of has like a Colin Quinn thing happening and a Scott Farrell thing happening.  It's a little combination of the two.  It's just. 
[00:49:00]  Well, there you go.  It's too put on.  It's too trying too hard.  Yeah, I know the rest of the media is listening, so it's simple.  Fonzie.  Charlie Sheen becoming a joke.  There's your headline, okay?  Go with it.  Trust me on this.  Go with it.  Don't worry so much about what it looks like on the outside.  Do a little digging and see what he's doing here.  It's very calculated.  Yes.  Don't just go with the, oh, Charlie Sheen's crazy story.  Do a little research.  All right.  Jimmy's back for a little bit. 
[00:49:30]  Yes.  And then you leave us again.  I leave Thursday during the day.  I pushed my San Francisco flight back so I could be here for longer.  Oh, Frisco.  Yay.  I'm in the Cobbs this weekend.  All right.  And when we get back, we obviously got to talk about Mike DiStefano for a few minutes.  Yeah.  Just fucking horrible, tragic news.  Oh, did that, did you guys, I woke up to that yesterday in L.A., but you didn't know.  We didn't know when we were on the air.  We didn't know.  Started getting tweets right after the show.  Yep.  And Jimmy certainly knew him very well. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  We knew him pretty well.  I mean, he started doing our show.  Well, we'll talk about it after the break, all right?  Yar.  All right.  The virus.  Virus.  Call the Open Ante Show now.  866-119.  Wow.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to feedback at opianthony.com.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:50:30]  We're in a weird spot right now.  I want to talk about Mike DiStefano for a minute or two.  And Jimmy, who definitely knew him much better than we did, is in the bathroom taking a shit. 
[00:51:00]  Fittingly enough.  Fittingly enough.  It's Jimmy.  This is perfect.  He's taking a shit.  I think Mike DiStefano would appreciate that.  Of course.  We're about to talk nicely about him, but we can't because Jimmy's taking a shit.  He's taking a shite.  Yeah, that's Jimmy though.  What are you going to do?  I remember meeting Mike for the first time.  It was at a Dennis Leary show.  Oh yeah?  And Dennis had a great lineup of comics and a bunch of guys I didn't really know.  And I met or saw for the first time that night Mike DiStefano and Jim Jeffries. 
[00:51:30]  Oh.  And then they both became part of our show after that for a while.  And Mike did a lot of great stuff for this program.  Remember him at the Animation Fest.  Oh yeah.  It was a killing when most of the crowd didn't really know him yet.  And our crowd could be tough to the new guys.  Can they?  Holy shit.  Tough to the new guys, but in that one performance he turned everybody into a fan of his. 
[00:52:00]  And we've had a lot of guys in the show, and I'll say this, man.  He was so appreciative, so nice, just so genuine.  Really was like, would go out of his way to make sure we knew that he really, really  appreciated being on the show and everything we did for him.  Some guys, you know, not so much, is all I'm going to say.  Some guys, not so much.  And I'm not going to fucking name names today, but he was one of those guys that really went  out of his way to thank us.  Yeah, he liked being here.  That's for sure.  And I guess they're saying he died of a heart attack. 
[00:52:30]  When, though?  Do we know when?  I don't know.  It's Tuesday, so what?  Maybe on Sunday?  Do you think that takes that long?  It usually takes a little time to get around.  From what we were hearing, it was Sunday night.  Sunday night?  Oh, gee.  Or Sunday, I should say.  I don't know.  His career was just starting to take off.  He was out at a long time.  He had a one-man show that was getting a nice buzz.  Of course, he was on Last Comic Standing, and he killed on that.  He did great. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And him and Geraldo from the show are not dead.  That's kind of creepy.  Yeah, right?  I'm sure that's going to be coming up in the news in the coming days.  Jinxed.  Is the show cursed?  Shut up.  Jinxed show.  Jinxed show.  Right.  So.  And Jimmy's taking a shit.  That's a drag.  That's a drag.  And Jimmy's taking a shit.  No, we could do.  We could play.  I was going to do this after we talked about him.  Why don't we play a clip from when Mike was on our show.  Ooh.  And then Jimmy will come back and give his thoughts on the whole Mike DiStefano thing. 
[00:53:30]  All right?  Here's Mike DiStefano not too long ago talking about doing heroin at 15.  And making it funny, by the way.  Sorry.  My headphone thing is crackling.  It's okay.  Check this out, and then we'll have Jimmy.  You like your drug days?  I did heroin.  That was my thing.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah, and everybody, that's like so fascinating to people.  I never smoked pot. 
[00:54:00]  I didn't really drink.  Oh, that's fucked up.  Heroin was my gateway drug.  Heroin was your stepping stone.  That was my gateway drug to heroin.  You're supposed to start off slow and get to heroin.  Nope.  You're not supposed to jump right into it.  Nope.  Went right to the heroin.  Wow.  How does that work?  Wait a minute.  You might be the first person I've ever met that went right to heroin.  I grew up around it.  There was a lot of heroin dealers in my neighborhood.  But there were probably pot dealers, too.  They weren't dealing nickel bags of heroin.  They were dealing pounds of it.  How old were you?  15 when I did it first. 
[00:54:30]  When I started it.  Snorting?  Yeah, I started snorting, and then they told me how to shoot it.  All right.  Shooting was good.  Did you have your own works?  Yeah, yeah.  I had my own works.  And it was fun.  It was fun.  It was great.  Heroin was the best.  You're insane.  I can't tell.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm off for drugs now.  I'm off for drugs nine years.  I don't want to fast forward.  So you're 15.  I'm never going to say heroin sucks.  People say, if you've never tried it, it's like having your dick sucked and a puppy licking 
[00:55:00]  your nose at the same time.  Kind of imagine, right?  You know the beauty of that.  But reverse the participants.  Right.  No, and then the girl bites your dick off and kills the puppy.  But still, you wake up the next day and go, I want to do that again.  But dude, at 15, I was scared to drink half a beer.  How does it go through your head that at 15, I'm going to try heroin?  I don't get that.  I had a cast on my arm from my father hitting me with a baseball bat.  So that's the kind of shot. 
[00:55:30]  Is that real?  Yeah, I swear to God.  Why'd he hit you?  Why not?  Why didn't he?  He broke my arm with a baseball bat.  I don't think there is any why.  But what'd you do wrong in his eyes?  What could I have done?  Killed the fucking, my little baby brother?  I understand that.  But there was a reason why.  You sound like a therapist that wants me to fucking stay sick.  Fuck you with that therapist shit.  Talk to him.  No, no.  He's pushing me towards, like, blaming myself for being beaten.  Is what I'm saying.  My father broke my fucking arm on yourself. 
[00:56:00]  No, but what was the reason?  You should be a rape counselor.  What were you wearing?  Dude, I'm going to relate to you.  Not with broken bones, but, like, my mom would yell and scream when I was a kid.  Same thing.  Over the most stupidest shit.  What he's saying is this.  So what I'm saying is there was some reason why he did.  It's not going to make sense, but what?  What is his reason?  You left your sneakers on the floor?  What dumb thing did you do?  I don't remember.  I swear to God.  Like, my father was just a violent dude.  He was a violent guy.  You know, we grew up in violence. 
[00:56:30]  I live right across the street from a numbers store where my father hung out.  Card games.  All wise guys.  It was just, that's how I grew up.  Hitting kids was normal, but, like, he would overdo it.  And he'd fucking.  So you asked me about shooting the dope, but I'm scared.  So you got the arm on your cast.  Yeah, my fucking arm's broken from my father.  So I don't, you know, I mean, there's so much pain, mental anguish that's fucking sticking  a needle in my arm.  It's not the needle that hurt.  It's what you're going to get when you hit the plunger.  That's why you do it. 
[00:57:00]  It hurts for a second.  It's a pinch.  But then the blowjob, you know what I mean?  Yeah, puppy.  All of a sudden, mommy loves you and everything's wonderful.  So you grab the, uh, at 15, you start snorting it from who?  I just, neighborhood guys.  There's some dude.  Older?  Yeah, a little bit older than me.  I grew up, I'm, I'm from Throgs Neck.  You know, you've heard of it?  Throgs Neck in the Bronx.  Sure, they got a bridge there.  I know the bridge.  Yeah, the bridge, yeah, well.  There's actually a neighborhood below that fucking thing?  Yeah, no, the whole, it's all, uh.  Isn't that just part of Queens?  You know, there's a lot of guys from Harlem there that grew up in Harlem. 
[00:57:30]  Italians, they were drug dealers, heroin dealers.  You know, so there was a lot of heroin in the neighborhood.  So I just, I tried it.  It was, you know, and I liked it.  What, what'd you get the first time out of it?  You throw, I threw up like an animal.  Like sick, but no, but, and you want to die, but then when you stop throwing up and the drug does its thing, you're like, that was so worth it.  I want more, you know? 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  No, it's a great, it's a, you know, that's why people tell, I get paid, I actually.  When was the next time you did it after that?  The next day.  I was, you were done.  He started his career.  I was hooked in a week.  I was, I was, yeah, I was hooked in like a week.  I had a habit.  Like I had to have it every day.  What did you, what did you do to get it?  Uh, nothing like Voss did.  I've never, what was the worst thing you did to get it?  The worst thing I did, uh, robbing people, breaking in the halls.  Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.  Robbing people, uh, I brought, yeah, B and E's, Ray Mansion. 
[00:58:30]  Uh, I'm trying to think of statute of limitations.  I think you're past it.  I want to notice some crimes.  I think you're all right.  No, I did, we did, you know, we did things.  And my fam, my brother's a criminal.  So like, I, I would hang with him and do crime, like things.  And he was not on drugs.  So I would get the, the drugs, you know, he, we would do stuff.  So, all right, you snorted for how long? 
[00:59:00]  I hit things.  Uh, maybe a couple of years.  And then you went to the needle?  Yeah, the needle.  Why?  Because you needed a better rush?  It's economics, man.  You sniff 10 bags of dope or you shoot two bags.  What would you, you know what I mean?  You just do it.  That's, that's the philosophy of it.  Yeah.  It's a mess.  I was 18.  I was on methadone.  I was over at the methadone clinic.  Uh, I used to get off at the train at the fucking York hospital.  The same stop as Hunter college.  So I'd be on the train with all these kids that were my age. 
[00:59:30]  They were going to college.  I was going to get my methadone.  It was a mess, you know?  And then I went to rehab and started getting clean.  I got clean for a few years.  I relapsed again on and off for 20 years.  And finally nine years ago, I stopped.  That was it.  Mike DeStefano from our show a couple of years ago, talking about heroin.  He has fucked up.  He had a hell of a life, man.  Oh my God.  And, uh, he was clean at the end of his life, by the way.  Yeah.  I just want to make that.  11 years, I think. 
[01:00:00]  11 years.  So.  Was he 44?  That's what they said.  I thought he was old.  He looked older.  He did look older.  Yeah.  Well, that's just it.  It's a rough 44.  Yeah.  And he, uh, he turned his life around and become, became a really, really successful comic by  the end.  So.  Uh, Jimmy's back.  Uh, we were joking that, uh, this is perfect.  We're trying to talk about Mike DeStefano in a nice way and you're in the bathroom taking  a shit.  And I think in some weird way, Mike would have appreciated that.  Oh, he would have understood.  That was a, that was a, that was a fucking eight log coffee dump and my finger broke  through the paper. 
[01:00:30]  Oh no.  That wafer thinned.  And there was a guy in there longer than me.  I think they, no, I'm okay.  I didn't watch it.  I think there's a guy that died.  Uh, he's just on the bowl.  That was a, what a, wow.  Was that a good one?  So yeah.  I was like, oh boy, the guys are probably back on here.  But, uh, so you were in LA, um, uh, doing, uh, that metal show.  What is it called?  That metal show.  That metal show.  Right.  Jim, Eddie and, um, and Don Anderson.  And I woke up yesterday at like, cause I knew I had a late call. 
[01:01:00]  So we're probably like around noon or one or something.  And I got a bunch of texts from people that Mike had died.  Very sad.  I mean, a fucking, you know, it's like heart attack is fucking not the way you want to  go with.  There's a lot worse ways to go.  And, uh, I was saying in the break that I had mixed feelings about it.  I mean, obviously I'm sad.  That's, that's a given, but it's also like, I'm sure Mike would have been grateful.  Like he didn't go out early.  Like Greg did.  Greg went out fucking early.  Mike, if life was fair, Mike would have been dead 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years 
[01:01:30]  ago.  If life was, people would say life's not fair.  If life was fair, Mike would have died in the street.  Like he was fucking a heroin addict.  He was HIV positive.  Fucking guy gets clean and sober and he fucking gets into a job he loves and he fucking gets  a nice amount of notoriety for himself.  He's loved by people.  Fucking, uh, he had a lot of friends.  He did, he worked in, he performed in prisons.  He performed in rehabs for free.  He was a great guy, man.  And he gave a lot of himself.  So it's like, it's very sad, but it's also like, if you sat him down at one point when 
[01:02:00]  he was at his worst and said, you're going to get clean and have 11 years and you're  going to, he probably would have signed up for that in a second.  Yeah.  It's much, it's not enough time, but it's like, at least he, he, he fucking went out sober  and it wasn't from some bullshit relapse or some fucking nonsense.  It was like a heart attack and it happens.  People die of heart attacks.  It's just, you know, that's a great take.  Well, did he give any impression that he was sick?  No, I heard, from what I heard, Rich Voss actually told me, and you never want to get  your medical information from Voss.  Um, yeah. 
[01:02:30]  Dr. Voss.  Uh, I heard he wasn't feeling well on Sunday night and he went to the hospital and just,  I guess he had a massive coroner, you know, I don't know.  That's all I know about it was that he just had a very, very, uh.  And you guys did the sober show together recently.  We did, Comedy Central.  I didn't want to do it because the money was so bad, but Mike said, look, they won't, you  know, I really want you to do it.  And I just did it like, I was like, fuck it, all of us are sober.  We'll do it.  And I'm actually very, very happy I did.  Yeah, I was looking at pictures of you guys, uh, backstage, just hanging out, laughing.  It was you, Bob Kelly, Rich Voss, and of course, Mike DiStefano. 
[01:03:00]  Uh, they have, have they aired that?  Oh, yeah, they did.  They waited a while, though, because Mike started getting so much heat on the last comic  that they wanted to, you know, which was smart by then, they wanted to capitalize.  Right.  He didn't look like he, um, kind of took care of himself very well.  No, I don't think Mike was doing all the crunches he should have done.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know if he was just smoking at the end, though.  Did he quit smoking?  Was he, I know he's a smoker, but I don't know if he was at the end, but that may have  contributed to his heart being weaker.  Oh, smoking is so bad.  Oh, it's horrible, dude.  Seems like it's, uh, always connected. 
[01:03:30]  It really is the one thing he could do that just, like, knocks down your numbers, right?  Knocks down the numbers for so many things.  Oh.  He may have quit, I don't remember.  Smoking is awful.  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I don't either.  I thought he was older than 44.  Yeah.  I thought he was.  But again, it was a rough fucking 44 years.  I mean, or at least 33 of it was very rough.  Yeah, I had him in his 50s.  Yeah, I was 49 or something.  But, uh, you know, doing drugs like that, and his wife, one of his wives, I think his  first wife, or maybe his only wife, uh, passed away.  Yeah.  Um, he overcame a lot of shit, man. 
[01:04:00]  There's something I want to play in the 10 o'clock hour.  Did you ever hear, uh, Franny's Last Ride?  Uh-uh.  Tweeted it last night.  It's, uh, you know, it's one of these comedy festivals where you tell stories, and you're  not necessarily going for the jokes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, like a one-man show, wherever you are.  And he tells a story about, uh, you know, Franny, who he obviously loved and married,  and she had AIDS, and they moved to-  Oh, she died of AIDS?  I believe-  Maybe you're right.  I didn't know.  And they moved to Florida together, because the air was better for her, because, you know,  she was, she was in some deep shit, and they were both really young. 
[01:04:30]  This story will kill you.  Yeah.  But it'll tell you, it'll show you what kind of a guy he was.  Yeah.  I guess they got it from fucking-  We could play that at 10, because it's, it is, uh, wow, it's heart-wrenching.  Sharing them needles.  I wish I had seen his one-man show.  He was doing a one-man show.  He knew how to tell a story, I'll tell you.  And he didn't mind that he wasn't getting laughs.  He didn't worry about that.  You know what I mean?  Well, Jim was on the plane with me, Florentine and I flew home together, and, you know, Jade  killed herself.  And Jim's doing a one-man show about, uh, that.  You know?  And he said that Mike inspired him to do it, because he's like, I didn't know what to 
[01:05:00]  do with it.  A lot of people fucking said how much Mike really helped them.  Like, being sober.  I mean, he really was a fucking good dude, man.  And Jim was just, a few hours ago, he's like, you know, Mike talked to him, because his wife  had died, so he went through, you know, an awful experience, and encouraged him to go  up and story-tell and fucking, don't worry about laughs, just fucking make it.  And now Jim is actually doing that.  Right.  That's the one, man.  I didn't know Mike had talked him into it.  Yeah.  Fuck.  But yeah, he had a lot of positive effect on people, man.  He really did.  People loved him.  I should say good effect.  People fucking loved the guy. 
[01:05:30]  There was a lot of sadness on Twitter yesterday from people that just said, yeah, fuck, I'm  breaking down my own wall today.  Fuck the jokes.  Yeah, he was a fucking...  I gotta talk nicely about this guy, because he was genuine.  He was dirty.  He was a harsh comedian.  He told it like he fucking saw it.  You know what I mean?  Mike really spoke his mind.  He was funny.  He did politically vile and incorrect material, you know?  Mike was very honest on stage.  He was great.  Yeah.  All right.  We can play another clip from our show.  Take a quick break, and we'll get into other things. 
[01:06:00]  But another clip from Mike DiStefano, who passed away this past weekend.  Yeah, yeah.  Sunday night.  Of a heart attack.  Here he talks about surviving life in general, because he ended up going to prison for a while.  How many years was he in prison?  I honestly don't know.  I don't know Mike's...  Again, this...  And this goes way back, too, of course.  I don't know much of his story other than what I just heard in a little piece.  Like, I knew he was HIV positive for a long time.  But I guess being sober for a long time is, like, so many people you know have gone to  prison, or you've heard it so many times, it's not odd to me. 
[01:06:30]  Like, I might have heard it and not even registered it.  Like, if...  You know what I mean?  It's like, you know, you hear in meetings, guys that just did 20 years, it's very common.  So, if you hear it sometimes, that was something that won't really resonate.  Okay.  Let's play this to break.  What about the tattoos?  I never realized you had so many tattoos.  I just got several of them.  What are the Asian ones?  Tibetan.  I'm actually...  I actually am into Buddhism, if you can believe it. 
[01:07:00]  Except for the non-violence part.  I don't go for that whole non-violence shit.  Anthony.  That's...  I think that was, like, one of the cornerstones of the Buddhist religion.  They say, yeah, non-violence.  It's like being a Christian, except for the whole Jesus thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Weren't you violent just a week ago with Marty the animal?  No, I wasn't violent.  I was definitely not a good Buddhist, though.  Mike, I like you, man.  Yeah, I try.  And right under Buddha, you have Jesus.  Yeah, look, this was from 20 years ago.  My friend Anthony died when we were kids. 
[01:07:30]  And when he died, I got the Jesus thing, because that's the Bronx, you know, Italian thing.  And then, you know, I got here and now on my wrists, so I don't forget to fucking stay in the moment.  Try to live in the moment, because I'm always all over the place.  And that's about it.  This is a Tibetan prayer.  You sure?  Yeah, no, it is.  It's so money.  Pardon me, home.  It's a great thing.  I really do.  I really meditate and shit, believe it or not.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  You might need a little more of that.  I'm not good at it.  Oh, really?  Oh, I'm trying, buddy.  I'm trying.  I've been through a lot, you know what I mean?  So I'm trying.  And you were funny the whole time?  I don't think I...  When I was on heroin, I wasn't that funny.  But, you know, when I got into rehab and all, I started developing a sense of humor.  Well, I'm a nice and funny guy.  It's almost like you can tell by talking to a guy, if he's a funny guy in the neighborhood  and just a fun guy, just a shit talk.  It's like Keith Robinson. 
[01:08:30]  I talk about him a lot, but, you know, Keith is just a shit talker in a funny way.  Yeah, he's fun.  Ah, shut up.  He's just one of those guys that it doesn't have to be a punchline.  Just like, I enjoy talking to this guy.  Yeah, the technicality of being a stand-up is starting to get into me.  But I was always funny, I think.  I always had people laughing.  You know what I mean?  You'd be jail funny.  Like, you'd be funny in jail.  Yeah, yeah, no doubt.  That's a good thing.  Mike would make guys in jail laugh.  Yeah, yeah, that's how I survived my life, through jokes.  I really did.  Like, I was never, you know, like, I got a lot of friends that are tough, you know, like 
[01:09:00]  tough guys, you know what I mean?  And they love me because of my sense of humor, not because I'm tough or any of that shit.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  So I'm like this guy that survived the neighborhood, and I'm very loved by a lot of people that  are, you know, tough guys, like wise guys, like real street guys, but they like me because  of my sense of humor.  They want me around.  Yeah.  So it's fun.  You know, it's always, that's been my thing. 
[01:09:30]  Wow.  Yeah, it's a trip.  That's a hell of a story, man.  Oh, it's nothing, bro.  I can't fucking, forget it.  That ain't shit.  I figure.  Another fucked up comic.  I know.  Another comic that just has a fucking fucked past.  But yeah, it's the way you relate to it, though, isn't it, though?  Because everyone's got a fucked past, but they're still, they're dysfunctional, and they're  still living it.  I'm not really living it.  I got the anger issue, you know, stuff like that that's coming out now, but I'm not really  like that.  Follow the O.B. 
[01:10:00]  and Anthony show on Twitter.  O.B.  Twitter.com slash O.B.  Radio.  Anthony.  Twitter.com slash Anthony Cumia.  And little Jimmy Norton.  Twitter.com slash Jim Norton.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Jimmy.  Cannot be able to play certain clips that were, what fucking ridiculous shit.  Did you miss this place?  Fucking ridiculous. 
[01:10:30]  We were just catching up with Jimmy, and, uh, oh, is this the video?  Hold on one second.  They finally got the video out there?  Where is this?  Ah, but they don't show it.  I'll explain in a second.  Uh, yeah, Jimmy's back from L.A., and, you know, because of the whole Charlie Sheen thing,  we're developing the 10 o'clock hour, finally, doing some things.  And yesterday, we wanted to play some Brie Olson clips, who goes by the name of Rachel?  Her real name is Rachel.  Rachel, okay. 
[01:11:00]  One of the goddesses, Charlie Sheen's goddesses, and we know her pretty well, or, uh, yeah,  I guess we know her.  Yeah, she's not doing any press.  I texted her, and she texted me back, and I invited her on the show, but she didn't  get back to me, and I understood why.  She's, you know, she's not doing any press.  She had a big crush on Jimmy, and she did some things with Earl and, uh, and, uh, Queen  Pie Jones.  By the way, and I piled on after you.  I had to.  Really?  Yeah, because, uh, fucking Black Earl is praising Ron and Fez yesterday.  Oh, I know, yeah, yeah, I had to nail him.  And we love Ron and Fez, but it's like, hey, asshole.  Of course.  First of all, we got to the gig with Ron and Fez after we were done with your ass. 
[01:11:30]  Don't try to divide and conquer the Ron and Fez and Opie and Anthony show, motherfucker.  Well, I love the Ron and Fez, but enough already.  Earl.  So you beat him up on Twitter, and then I jumped right on after you and said, look,  who the fuck got you jerked off by one of Charlie Sheen's goddesses?  Yes.  That's a moment.  This very program.  I said, uh, Ronnie never got you jerked off by one of the goddesses?  No.  So what did Ronnie ever do to you?  We got your fucking dick wet. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  And that leads to why Jimmy might be a little pissed at the moment, but we'll get past it.  Because then we wanted to play Earl getting jerked off.  Sure.  Supposedly there was other things happening, but it was never confirmed.  And then there was a Cream Pie Jones incident with Brie Olson.  I never knew about that one.  She was a big-time porn star.  I guess she's not doing porn anymore.  Do you know anything about that, Jimmy, by the way?  Don't know.  I do believe that she's not, um, I don't know what her situation with Charlie will be, but...  So the Charles Sheen story is the biggest story in the country. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  We know one of the goddesses.  And we have audio.  And we have great audio of her doing some crazy stuff.  So we're like, ah, play that at 10 o'clock.  It was a no-brainer decision on our part.  Of course you gotta play it.  All of a sudden the guys heard us talking about it, and they come running down the hall.  If there's insertion or bodily fluids, you can't play it.  Why?  Well, like, it already happened.  It happened.  It's not really happening in the studio.  I'm not a fan of erasing the past.  You can't do that. 
[01:13:00]  And there's also, it's fucking audio.  It's audio.  Will you stop listening to your fucking stupid lawyers?  We don't even know if it happened.  If you can't do it now, you can't play it now.  If you can't do it now, you can't play it now.  That's fucking nonsense.  That's good stuff right there.  That's a good rule of thumb.  That could be a good catchphrase for Charlie Sheen, too.  And if you can't do it now, you can't play it now.  Boom.  That's fucking ridiculous.  That is ridiculous. 
[01:13:30]  It makes no sense.  I love blanket rules, too, where it's like, no, that's the policy.  So we can't play drinking contest then?  I guess we can't play anything we ever had alcohol in the studio.  Can't play that, right?  Because we can't do it now.  So I guess those times when we hit the baby bird, can't play that because we can't do that anymore.  Pat from Wunaki's eating contest, guess we can't play that anymore.  We can't replay baby bird if we wanted to?  Guess not.  Nope.  Guess not.  Can't do it now.  Can't play it now.  Was that actually the terminology that was used by anybody?  Yeah.  Well, that's ridiculous.  If that's the philosophy, it's idiotic.  You can't erase the past, plus the fact that it's legal. 
[01:14:00]  And it's not.  It's legal as far as this type of radio goes.  It isn't happening, and it's totally legal.  It's fucking theater of the mind.  They have a new policy.  They don't want any of that on their air because someone really fucked up bad, and that's the  main reason why I don't like the guy, by the way.  What do you mean someone fucked up bad?  I don't know what you mean, buddy.  I don't even want to fucking deal with another war, but I'll tell you off air.  If somebody fucked up bad, that would mean they're worried that if somebody comes in here  and does something, and things like that are happening, and someone gets hurt or whatever, 
[01:14:30]  that they could be liable for it.  It's a recording.  Nothing different is going to happen on the recording than happened.  So you know how it ends.  Are we allowed to play porn audio?  We can.  Oh, well.  Oh, well, that's insertion.  You know what?  I asked the very same question.  I don't know.  And what answer did you give it?  Well, not to anybody who can give me a proper answer, but I kind of brought that up.  Kind of like has the point, like, well, what about, like, you know, playing porn audio.  Satellite radio, as far as the government goes, allows this type of radio. 
[01:15:00]  Yes, true to you.  We're an XL channel, so people know what they're getting when they tune in to us.  And like Anne said, you can't change what happened.  It's going to be the same outcome, and we know everyone was safe and okay in the end.  So why can't you play something that happened already that breaks a new policy that is a company policy,  has nothing to do with the government?  It makes no sense.  Well, let's go over the stuff that we can't play.  Because you can't do eating contests or drinking contests, nothing with alcohol or any type  of contest with food, it's fucking itty. 
[01:15:30]  We don't turn into regular radio.  And then there's, of course, a double standard.  Howard has guys, well, hello, has girls riding the, you know, his, what is it called?  The Sibian.  The Sibian.  Are they dressed today?  I've never seen it on the show.  Well, everyone knows there's insertion going on over there, but, you know, he gets to live  by different rules, and then that's his thing.  I'm not trying to fucking jump on him for it, but, you know, the company's got to, you can't  play it both ways.  You can't play it both ways. 
[01:16:00]  Especially with a bit that already happened.  That's what doesn't make sense.  We gave up on fighting the actual policy, but now we have to give up on playing some old  stuff that was really good radio because of a new policy?  That is so fucking stupid and babyish and lawyer lazy.  That's lazy, unmotivated, uninspired attorneys.  They don't want to take a case by case. 
[01:16:30]  They want to just have a blanket rule so they don't have to work.  We had great audio of one of the goddesses, and then instead we played some just okay  audio of her just talking about having sex.  Okay, then why don't we do this?  Why don't we play the audio, and whenever a fluid happens, whenever there's some type  of a seepage, when the testes tighten and the scrotal area kind of tightens up like a grip 
[01:17:00]  around a walnut.  Yeah, and fluid comes out.  Right, right, yeah.  Maybe there we can play something really ludicrous over it to cover the offending fluid.  I bet you we're not even allowed to do that.  I bet you, how about you play fucking, how about you, over the fluid, you play fucking  audio of a waterfall, or some ludicrous type, or something more offensive, like audio of  a guy being murdered and a fucking, like Sonny Corleone being shot. 
[01:17:30]  Oh yeah, you can play that.  It just doesn't.  You can play real people being killed.  We should do it and completely mock them.  There's a way to do it.  There's a beheading video sound you can put over it.  There you go.  And that wouldn't be as offensive.  That's insertion, though.  It certainly goes into the net.  Sean and George, last week on Tosh.0, they showed a guy pissing in his own mouth, and  that was on regular TV.  Or Comedy Central, which is...  They're fucking amazing here.  It doesn't make any sense, and we lost that argument, because it's kind of silly to even 
[01:18:00]  fight it.  Elo looking like a fucking star on the Oprah show.  Yeah.  You know that dumb show I watched?  I told you the reality show, the behind the scenes of Oprah?  Yeah.  Elo made his first appearance.  Oh, he did?  Petting Oprah's dog.  Really?  Or...  I thought he was Oprah's dog.  Looking fucking young, man.  Yeah.  Looking real healthy.  Boy, this satellite radio was killing him.  It was killing him.  Holy shit.  He was all tan and, like, had a good weight and brand new hip clothes on, and Oprah, you 
[01:18:30]  could tell.  He was only on screen for maybe two minutes, but you could tell Oprah just loves him.  Loves him?  Loves Elo.  He was all fucking alcohol bloated and shit.  Oh, yeah, bloated fucking.  You could see the blue veins popping up on his face.  Oh, his fucking bloodshot eyes every day.  You'd see him.  You'd be like, oh, God.  Huge, huge gut.  She whipped him right into shape, huh?  Falling over his belt.  Oh, the gut.  Yeah.  Now he's all svelte, wearing good-fitting suits. 
[01:19:00]  I believe he's a lot younger than us, but it never looked it.  I always thought he was, like, older than everybody.  He just looked like utter shit.  He looked horrible.  But, man, you gotta say, he looks great on, uh, what is it called?  Season 25.  It's on the own channel.  It's a little reality show, behind-the-scenes shit.  God damn.  So, and he made his first appearance.  I've been in touch with him a little bit, and he goes, uh, yeah, I'll be on that show  eventually.  I'm like, all right.  And it finally happened, so. 
[01:19:30]  What was he doing?  Just fucking.  Did Oprah introduce him as anybody, or, like, say, hey?  No, just reference him as Eric.  Eric was mad at you yesterday, and then he comes in, and blah, blah, blah.  Oh.  And she's just smiling real big, and I don't think they work over there.  No, I ain't.  I get the impression that they don't really work.  I know Oprah doesn't work at all.  She has a lot of producers that just hand her shit, and she just kinda is sort of like  the puppet on TV, I finally figured out.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of a puppet.  What does Elo do? 
[01:20:00]  And, well, Oprah brings her dogs to work, and he's actually on his knees, you know how  you, like, to really admire the dog?  Hey!  They're all just admiring Oprah's dog.  Like, that's a hell of a work environment they got.  Boy, he must be just counting his blessings.  He loves it.  You can tell.  He's in a good place.  He stepped off of this ship when the boat was just going underwater.  The helicopter came down, the Oprah copter was coming down, and it sent that little hook 
[01:20:30]  thing for him, and he grabbed it the second his shoe was ready to go into the water from  the ship just going under the surface.  Don't kill the messenger, but one of the last meetings I had with, um, or sit-downs with  Elo, we didn't really have meetings.  I met him for a cup of coffee, and his hair was pretty much falling out, his face was bloated,  he was about 50 pounds overweight, his clothes were just hanging off his bloated body.  He was a wreck.  And, uh, he was explaining satellite radio to me and basically said, and this is what 
[01:21:00]  he said, I don't want any fucking shit for this, because satellite radio's never going  to be successful.  He said that.  I gotta get the fuck out of here.  And I think that was his tell, I think that was his way of telling me, look, man.  I'm out of here.  I know we're all in this together, but I'm abandoning ships soon.  He didn't say it officially, but I think that was his way of going, look, if you wanted, you  could follow me, because I got a dinghy, it's gonna be outside soon, and I'm jumping. 
[01:21:30]  No way I'm staying on this boat.  But you could see it, he was literally pulling his own hair out.  But dude, not only...  Because he wanted it to be successful, and he believed in it.  Not only did he take the life raft, he aimed at the iceberg, hit it, and then did what  that one guy did, and pushed the women and children out of the way.  It was despicable.  Yeah.  You think he made sure he was first in line?  He stepped on the face of a hungry child to grab the bottom.  It's despicable.  He was dressed like a woman.  Yeah, just to get in there. 
[01:22:00]  Hi, oh, please.  My baby.  You think he was the only man that made it to the life raft?  Oh, yeah, the only man.  Ducking his head down in shame.  Among women and children.  As the fucking SS Oprah comes and picks him up.  Yeah.  Poor Nate didn't have a shot.  No, please.  No.  Good, that went down.  Just waving at us as we're still on the ship.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I'll send a raft for you.  Yeah, thanks.  Yeah? 
[01:22:30]  Are you?  Thanks.  Are you?  The band's playing as we're just slipping beneath the surface.  Not only did he fuck us, he decided to go to a place where we would never work at.  You always have this dream when you like a guy and he moves on, you're thinking, hey,  he's going to call us.  He's going to take us with him.  Yeah.  He fucking picks Oprah.  Nothing.  There's nothing for us over there.  No door to hang on to in the freezing water.  Nothing.  Oh, he'd be the one kicking our fucking knuckles off the door.  Get the fuck off my door.  Right.  But Elo, remember? 
[01:23:00]  Totally despicable.  But with that said, he looks just amazing on this reality show that's on own.  Yeah.  It's worth taking a look just because you think you know Oprah and you watch the show.  Yeah.  Watch for yourself.  Why are we talking about Oprah?  Emo should be his name.  Somebody said, oh, okay, Scott in Jersey.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  Hey, before you guys know it, you guys aren't going to have a replay because they're not 
[01:23:30]  going to let you put on the radio in the afternoon what you do in the morning.  I love that you're joking, but that has happened.  I was serious.  Oh, you're serious?  Well, we've done things in the morning that went out there, and then they take it from  the replay like they try to erase that it ever happened.  And my argument's always been, look, it's already out there, so if it's going to cause  a problem, it's going to cause a problem.  You know?  They're bottom feeders.  They're terrible.  They're just despicable. 
[01:24:00]  They are.  It's just disgusting.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Enjoy your day, boy.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, we enjoy it.  I enjoy doing this.  It's just silly, though.  Yeah.  It's really just silly.  But not being able to play audio that was already, especially with the biggest story  in the country.  And we had really good audio.  Yeah, like exclusive stuff.  Exclusive stuff.  Exclusive.  Despicable thinking.  What was the official explanation?  I would like to hear that.  Who talked to the guys? 
[01:24:30]  Was it Travis?  I don't know.  Their official explanation was that they're boobs.  They said we're boobs.  We don't know what we're doing.  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Fools.  That's so true.  We did have Tiger Blood Radio over the weekend, right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Enough said.  That makes sense.  Do you care about that?  No.  Oh.  What was it?  Jimmy would appreciate that.  Tiger Blood?  There's a channel that dedicated Charlie Sheen all weekend.  Whole channel.  You know. 
[01:25:00]  You missed a lot, Jimmy.  Wait.  Jimmy's face is priceless right now.  What channel was that?  It was called Tiger Blood Radio.  that's here it was I think it's for the weekend is it one of these channels they  played it wasn't our channel they played clips of what's going on Charlie yeah  was that 101 no no he wouldn't he wouldn't want to fucking deal with that  he actually had a good idea he said that's right that's why I said he had a  good idea because he got to talk to Charlie and he said look fucking we'll 
[01:25:30]  set up something where if you want to just talk you could go live on our  channel any break in whatever it is yeah and that that of course is smart and  also a Kimmel appearance I saw him online it was a weird fucking hologram but it  looked like he was on the couch sooner or later TV is gonna be different you know  that was bizarre yeah yeah wait they had him on the couch he was yeah but he  looked like he was really there he was green screened um I guess from New York  was it live it was recorded in New York wait I'm confused Jimmy Kimmel made blue 
[01:26:00]  not made blue no everybody knew it was green screened but he was in New York and  he said that but they actually superimposed him onto a sofa so Jimmy's  looking right at him it looks like they're actually sitting like they were  sitting next to each other it looked like he was just on the couch next to the  desk doing and doing an interview and then one all right so so Jimmy wasn't  playing off audio that Charlie already did it was an actual interview but  Charlie wasn't there the green screen no Howard I think it was Stern yeah it was  Howard's interview oh okay when he would I didn't see I do it I'm so 
[01:26:30]  confused okay so Howard did an interview with Jimmy but he was in New York  gotcha and I saw a minute of it and the and the and the the intrigue in it was  they said it looks like he's really there whatever whatever the caption was I could  when you're sitting there looking one like when he's sitting there looking at  Kimmel you could see it was a little off because they're a little sideways a  sit what a great idea I thought it looked weird from the beginning because I was  like what did he acknowledge that it was green screen I'm sure they all know it  it's not good enough where you think you could fool people but it's just 
[01:27:00]  different than doing a split screen please welcome yeah last time  and then he walks out you can tell it's green screen but he's actually walking  out it looks like he's on the fucking set now now he's sitting in a chair he's not  really there he's a blind person from the side that's how a blind person would  sit you look fantastic and let me tell you that bit on the horse was amazing I 
[01:27:30]  have never seen anything like it I could have gone on another 10 minutes I'm telling  you see but he's not really there I know you're very excited to be here and I  appreciate that you know what Jimmy I don't want to seem like I'm an arrogant guy or  something's wrong with me slightly off it's slightly off like Jimmy Kimmel's  looking over the top of his head well Jimmy's looking at a screen yeah yeah you  can tell he's looking at a screen they wanted me to go out yeah he's looking at  the feed cell phone that's amazing yeah and I want to be if Kimmel moved his head 
[01:28:00]  slightly to the last yeah yeah it would be really perfect but to sort of go out and  there's a green tinge to uh I'm a guy I support my company I'm the guy that's not  natural no exactly that's not a natural but his hand is on the couch that's yeah the couch is there  the couch is part of the fucking thing that they superimpose he's sitting on a chair that's like  the one and that chair is in the middle of a big green like room with the floor and walls and  everything is green and they just key out the background saying okay yeah but when he's looking  sideways that's how like a blind person looks just kind of odd like the motion of the blind person 
[01:28:30]  yeah they don't turn their head that's the only but head-on it looks amazing they tell people  it was a green screen later on they did like a kind of a bit where um they're they're almost  trying to kiss each other going right right break and uh you could see they're kind of going through  each other jimmy actually has become believe it or not a real friend and then um reminds me of his  and then and then they show him in the green screen room dude that's up he wasn't  feeling well that morning he told me it was really weird he told you we chatted outside the bathroom 
[01:29:00]  from a little chat so he was ill yeah we made out a little chit chat i wanted to catch it but now  you don't have to fly to la to do tv shows yes and he even did like a throw you know how i certainly  does the throw the ball yeah thing the pitch well how do they and again it's just say yeah just cut  to jimmy kimmel and anyone could have been throwing that yeah that's pretty wild that's  fucking wild man yeah that's gonna start something and then you can tell like the size difference 
[01:29:30]  is jimmy kimmel towers over them which would never would happen that's right right huh yeah  very uh very very cool technology imagine two years from now how smooth that will be yeah kimmel's  producer she that was tremendous whoever thought of that is genius very uh he's very hammer and his  staff they're web savvy smart innovative yeah they are they're good man that's gonna be perfected  soon then you see he picks them up and throws them or something oh see but right there he's not 
[01:30:00]  really picking them up goodbye goodbye goodbye judy of course  see how could he throw he's not really a smart it's bullshit he didn't just do that that's  fucking that's fucking cool yeah i thought that was pretty cool oh i thought you meant charlie sheen  but okay now i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it all that technology all i would do is  green screen myself in better places than kimmel's couch like with my face in a girl's ass with  fucking logs on me but then i'd get up i'd be wearing a tuxedo i like i liked when you were 
[01:30:30]  over the house with uh doing the compound thing where you wrapped yourself in the green blanket  oh yeah it was just your ass floating exactly in midair it was delicious radio  just jimmy's ass that may sound despicable to most people but it was delicious radio  delicious a ton yeah a judge throws up hey uh where are you going honey what happened  ants on the floor you're right to plug something in oh what's going on  plug in my computer and it says what happened your your battery it's it's dying what do you 
[01:31:00]  buddy you uh what do you plug in hopefully you're holding water at the time no that would  be very dangerous uh we got we got local news having a completely different take on the charlie  sheen thing oh really just kind of like we were discussing yeah charlie's becoming a joke and um  yeah please and people think he's actually out of his mind but he's kind of playing a character  that he's out of his mind yeah and we will admit once again at any moment he could be out of his  mind again but he's not at this moment no he's just he's plays playing it it's a work it's a work 
[01:31:30]  all right but charlie radio huh charlie no who was it called blood tiger tiger blood tiger blood  tiger blood radio sex magic you would you would listen to that not even if it was real dripping  tiger blood although they couldn't do that because there's fluids fluids that's a good idea  just play dripping tiger 
[01:32:00]  uh fox reports on charlie on the roof of the building okay uh this statement and the blathering  comes as she's behavior gets increasingly erratic look at this he's on the roof  uh yeah and he's got a bottle in his hand presumably that's liquor there he  he said he had it presumably that's presumably that's liquor you  fucking idiot yank him off the news that was there was nothing indicating that's what he wants you  to think you stupid it's like the whole thing is that he's not drinking he's just trying to get 
[01:32:30]  some kind of um sponsorships with everything he drinks he's on naked beverages he's on the roof of the  live nation building so maybe he did a meeting with live nation okay yeah and then they probably  said yeah go on the roof do a little conan thing yeah here's a machete here yeah here's a prop and uh  well you got your tiger blood wherever the fuck you're drinking yeah bring that up there too  the media will eat this shit up and think you're drinking and out of your mind with the machete  and of course the news but it steps right into it won't be that slicker there he he said he had  a machete and uh actually tiger blood in his hand um and he claimed to have a top secret meeting with 
[01:33:00]  friends he doesn't have tiger blood you idiot they're dumb they really don't look into they're  taking everything he says completely literally when it's it's just him he officially doesn't have  actual tiger blood you ass and believe me i'm not sticking up for for charlie sheen i think he's  acting like a buffoon but uh i i am railing the news on this they're despicable dumb they're 
[01:33:30]  uninformed uh he's presumably we can get away with it but presumably we're despicable too presumably  alcohol yeah so he has alcohol and tiger blood i can only assume he's been snorting cocaine and uh  presumably uh he's shooting heroin and uh what i'm seeing it's what facts do you have to back any of  that up you're the news do a little research talk to talk to your kids because you're obviously 
[01:34:00]  out of touch or something they'll tell you what's going on they're a little more  fucking media savvy than the guys actually doing the news news snooze jews duh and they talk  booze booze nah man he uh he talks about charlie's webcast oh he does yes  apocalypse me the jaws of life uh that's the name of a book charlie imagines himself writing he made  the announcement during another rambling nonsense school imagining himself imagines himself writing 
[01:34:30]  it's like oh that was a goof too idiot yeah it's it's not gonna wait they're trying to make him sound  like he's completely gone off the deep end and everything he says is some delusional like lock  him up quick he's completely insane that's what he wants you to think some self-writing he made the  announcement during another rambling nonsense you stream performance on sheen's corner last night  uh sheen's as you can see just looks awful his hair is a mess his face is gone he's got some deep 
[01:35:00]  circles at one point he drinks from what appears to be a liquor bottle how does it appear to be a  so this is so irresponsible he he even said it wasn't liquor all you have to do is watch the  thing and realize it's not liquor and you also realize that he fucking made his hair fucked up  yeah because he knows that people only want to see a crazy version of him wait what's the liquor the  presumed liquor it was uh a point where he was drinking something and then he goes i'm not going  to show what this is unless you pay me and uh he said it was liquor nobody that's despicable him he 
[01:35:30]  wasn't saying it was liquor and it was it uh presumably wasn't liquor right most likely it  wasn't like no pointy drinks from what appears to be a liquor bottle uh it is the third installment  of his online show he doesn't mention being fired but he just appears to be unraveling it's unbelievable  by the way we're allowed to say appears to be because then maybe i could say that that guy's hair  appears that there was a cock in it recently that's my opinion he has his lips are shiny it appears 
[01:36:00]  that pre-cum is on his mouth it appears to be it appears that there's pre-cum on that man's  mouth yes i don't know his i don't know i don't know his name but he used to be a reporter that like  reported from dumb potholes and stuff and they gave him a big promotion to sit on the desk he sucks he's  horrible he appears to be horrible no he's horrible no he's horrible he's horrible well he moves in his  seat in a way that appears he has come leaking into his undershorts since we're allowed to say that you 
[01:36:30]  can you can say that appears that there's liquor it appears i can say that while you're reporting it  appears to me in my opinion that you have cum leaking into your shorts and pre-cum on your lips  it appears that he's had a big cock in his ass all night because it appears that he's uh very kind  of uh nervous in his seat yes jumpy which would uh lead me to believe that it appears that his  asshole is chafed possibly is a word they use when they want to sneak something in these  fucking cunts yeah yeah like possibly liquor well it's possibly anything yeah any liquid except for 
[01:37:00]  nitrogen which you know would fucking is that what liquid nitrogen yeah it would be very cold yeah  and the bottle would break he he read it completely wrong yeah yeah completely it appears oh here a lot  of time warner brothers cutting ties with the troubled actor who wasted no time talking to his newly  launched webcast to rant about it fox 5's carolyn gusoff is in the newsroom with the story this  morning he looks like he hasn't slept in days carolyn yeah he doesn't look well a lot of people 
[01:37:30]  speculating he might actually be sick rosanna and greg things seem to be going downhill fast for charlie  yesterday the actor as you said was fired from his hit show two and a half men something that didn't  seem to bother him judging from episode three of sheen's corner on ustream he seemed to be more  interested in making money not so much the job okay great great great well as it should be duh  we're still getting chipped jipped  have you had your breakfast yet my friend no i'm smoking a cigarette and drinking something i won't 
[01:38:00]  reveal unless they pay me well there he's talking to his friend and so-called tweet master bob maron  charlie's hair is a mess and you can see how gaunt and pale he looks it's the third installment of that  online show at one point he actually goes ballistic over planes making noise flying overhead and threatens  to change his phone number because people keep calling him free at last let's go with the black 
[01:38:30]  eye in the back a brief moment of clarity there and that's basically as good as it gets just moments  earlier the actor was waving a machete at the top of the live nation building in beverly hills where he  claimed to have a top secret meeting with friends that kind of behavior showing why warner brothers  made the decision to let him go in a letter to sheen's lawyer the studio said quote your client has  been engaged in dangerously self-destructive conduct and appears to be very ill here's sheen replying 
[01:39:00]  by a statement to tmz says quote this is very good news they continue to be in breach like so many whales  he goes on to say it is a big day of gladness at the sober valley lodge and i never have to put on  those silly shirts for as long as this warlock exists in this terrestrial dimension those silly  shirts referring to his characters bowling shirts on two and a half men and by the way greg and rosanna 
[01:39:30]  one of in one of his recent tweets he says that he's hiring an intern and accepting applications and i'm  just uh watching on the internet some media observers are suggesting this morning that this  intern search and this whole meltdown could be just an elaborate publicity stuff oh you tag the  end of the broadcast what does he need the publicity for i don't know for his next uh film you know he  still thinks he's going to be in that uh he's talking dummy majorly which was terrific 
[01:40:00]  ah yeah he's thinking that he's going to be doing the third installment so who knows but you know  it all boils down to thanks so much carolyn it appears that guy has come all over his forehead  they're going to finance holding his phil collins my understanding with charlie sheen is the guy  shows up here that he's been like you know he's ridiculous when he's not there but he's professional  in the past have kept himself together right now he seems a little out of control yeah yeah sure does  all right well what did you see see how in control he was when he went in for the meeting of course 
[01:40:30]  he showered his hair was perfect he had a nice fucking suit on yeah and then she said that only  lasted a few moments and then he's on the roof and he's crazy he went in there and did lines no he had  a meeting with some people and then said look i'm going to continue this character today i'm going  on your roof you got anything crazy here's a machete okay i'll take that and of course i'll make  believe my tiger blood uh cry whatever is is alcohol and they buy into all of it it's of course 
[01:41:00]  he made his hair messy for his fucking new stream uh cast charlie sheena i like the fact he's yelling  free at last when that was actually quoted by a guy trying to stop blacks from being water hosed  right and a fucking tree like sick and he feels as if he's in the same boat as them because he was  fired from a two million dollar a week gig yeah for acting like a complete ass publicly and shitting on his  bosses i find i think blacks are going to have trouble feeling empathy yes i think so and kinship  with charlie it's despicable all right we'll uh we'll break here ten and uh we got patrice o'neal 
[01:41:30]  who's gonna be at carolina he's also despicable yes 11 we'll certainly talk to him next  sirius xm the virus  so  carol the sheen baby patrice o'neal in studio playing carolines this weekend 212-757-4100 are you 
[01:42:00]  doing the thursday night what am i doing here what you're doing thursday night yeah  so they gave you the thursday friday saturday and sunday yes so you're camping out there yeah  i'm i'm there at the at the make my triumphant return to carolines comedy club once again uh not 
[01:42:30]  being retired that retirement thing we're all happy i'm gonna fucking i was thinking about playing a  lottery i'm getting out of this chicken outfit where did the rest of the guys go they just gone  it's it's confusion it's it's just gone let me let me let me state this right now charlie sheen  charlie sheen but i'm gonna say what's your take it's a weird take my take yeah he's a free man we  should all be jealous of him last free last he's a free man we've seen a free man you make fun of that 
[01:43:00]  motherfucker but he's a free man dude and that's that's a great thing to be but i don't give a  fuck what he do you do agree he's not as crazy as the media is making him out to be right i i think that  he is um he's he's a peculiar guy but who cares though it's like i think he had been on on whatever  he's been on he's been on tiger blood since the day one and you can't you don't understand man people  who are corn balls they don't to be really funny man you gotta have problems man any funny guy without 
[01:43:30]  problems is a fucking just a douche right no one likes him the more problems you have the funnier you  could be he's a fucking hilarious think of your funniest guys in history they all had issues and  they under they understood that at warner brothers they knew they were dealing with a guy that had  issues but that's what made him great but something happened i mean i i think he you really think he's  happy that he lost that gig though i don't i think he's a free man dude i think he's free i don't i don't  think he wanted to be free at first i know i think he's a free he's free not he's just he's just a guy who 
[01:44:00]  who he he want he's he is what we all want to be no fired a fucking free but i mean i mean i mean  it's not about the the the gig it's about his his life he's a free man dude some people don't want to  be some people feel comfortable being you know we're in the position to end i mean i it's it's two  things you're comparing i'm comparing your spirit and right right comparing his money i'm comparing a 
[01:44:30]  day-to-day spirit and and he's doing what the fuck he wants to do it doesn't bother me and i think i  think i'm jealous of the guy i think he's mad because the rules changed i think i think they were  completely aware like you were saying that uh warner brothers was aware that they're dealing with a guy  that has some issues but he came to work and he performed and everyone was like fantastic it's like  as long as you perform i don't we don't care what you're doing on the side and that's fine but  somewhere along the line uh somewhere along the way the the rules changed whether he started 
[01:45:00]  fucking up uh bad at work or i don't think the rules changed i think it changed for people in the  in the power position man but then that's what got him mad like what the fuck man the rules changed  you guys were okay with my lifestyle as long as everything was running smoothly at work any any any  any he betrayed the cartel man you can't betray the people that you are in cahoots with there is  there are no one thing in this game in mel gibson to tell you because mel gibson is at the top of  the food chain but you can't fuck with the people that you um have aligned yourself with yeah we were 
[01:45:30]  suspicious about that we didn't think he went too far he fucked with except they think he  fucked with jews and that's who he aligned himself with oh yeah but that's who he aligned himself with  he was fucking acting it was like they tolerated a lot of shit from him or a lot of stuff that was  none of their business but that would typically get somebody in trouble because of who he was  but if he wanted to be out he didn't have to re-up he's panicking that he got fired  because again we've been on that end of it man he lost a two million dollar a week cake walk 
[01:46:00]  yeah but maybe it's like he has ex-wives and i like kids he's panicking you're in this business jim  it's like it's not a cakewalk you know it's not a cakewalk and you deal with life on this level on  the radio level it's not cakewalk but nothing's a cakewalk exactly so it's like to compare money  and and your i don't even want to be dramatic and say soul but to compare your soul and money 
[01:46:30]  it just to me it doesn't combine this kid is a cake i like patrice's uh take on this it's a it's a  new twist that i haven't heard yet and yeah this guy can now wake up whenever the fuck he wants he's  got enough money where he doesn't have to ever move out of his money i heard he i heard he was  not did not have enough money and again i don't know how true it is right i mean but i know somebody  that knows him and i heard that he was in financial trouble actually a couple of years ago because he  has so many he has ex-wives and he has a lot of bills to pay he may he may be set for life but he 
[01:47:00]  could have just not re-upped but who's not going to hire him now as long as he didn't offend i don't  know where where this guy chuck laurie is on the in in the in the cartel fucking cartel well it's a  lot of cartels man but he's talking about how he doesn't want to wear the funny shirts anymore so  he's going to get another gig where he has to wear funny shirts don't ever where is he gonna go he's  got me he's got major league three or another sitcom where he wears funny shirts can i can i maybe a  reality show can i say something like who my carrier is at&t or my my i don't know i'm doing 
[01:47:30]  commercials but i i just has who i have or or even comcast cable for my cable you you call them  they cut off i guess showtime and i and at this point is to is to you know wearing funny shirts  somewhere else showtime cut the movie channel off so now the movie channel is alone without a package  that you have to buy and i'm like well why don't you just put movie channel out of business no one's 
[01:48:00]  buying the movie channel yeah outside of a package and i go look if i have to pay for the movie  channel and i want the movie channel here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna leave to go get  fucked somewhere else because getting fucked by comcast you i've been there with them for six  years yeah yeah so i'm not gonna let you me and i know you so i'll go get  fucked by a new person and treated poorly come in getting treated poorly as opposed to you're gonna 
[01:48:30]  these my family these people that i've that you would rather me you would rather  fucking save the ten dollars a month instead of giving it to me i've been i probably paid you  75 000 over the last six years you would rather see me go than to fucking give me that little thing  you don't see that i've been a loyal customer up to that point you know what i'm gonna wear the funny  shirts at direct tv but you can't let direct tv fuck me because i don't know that you saying i  want to leave direct i want to leave the thing and and like i want to get fucked somewhere else i 
[01:49:00]  understand that but then the difference is when you continually are going everywhere and daring them  to do it it's almost like you're daring to do it and he's old man i think he overrated his value  there is scary they fired tom cruise they'll fire him it's a scary game when you're dealing with these  fucking people dude i look i deal with jews boo sorry i deal with jews because one thing jews don't  let you do they don't they don't want you to be jewish like they don't make you join you just have 
[01:49:30]  to make some money black people don't want you to be black say that again i said black people don't  want you to be black even though it's bombed the first time i'll say that i'll say i'll say  i'm fucking stunk but they leave you alone they leave you alone so he's pissing off a group that  lets you do what you do right long as you do it and they make a couple of dollars and you're good at  it you're so something happened for you to like for him to be screaming something happened for him to 
[01:50:00]  continuously be talking and all of a sudden he done lost it lost it something happened man he's  either scared to death because look at who he named in his fucking team of guys uh uh mel gibson sean  penn legitimate what they call hollywood eccentrics man yeah he aligned himself with there's some  fucking some some strangeness going on because charlie sheen is the highest paid tv actor in the world 
[01:50:30]  and that's when you talk about the beast and being in the belly i'm not even in really in the  mouth you might be in the mouth being chewed up but charlie sheen's in the belly when you're dealing  with shit like that you don't know what the fuck is going on and the shit people want you to do man  they gave him a raise he's the highest paid guy in the game it's it's i'm not saying that that raises  like that coffee in your but how are they i can't comprehend how they treated him bad it was like 
[01:51:00]  when when he fucked up you know how it is when networks he fucks up and he gets arrested for a  little knife or he didn't have a knife whatever it was they don't abandon him through any of that  shit that he's pulled all over these years they don't abandon him they don't publicly maybe they  behind the scenes they could just stop it could be of advertising to sell but they didn't abandon  him and then he just dared them and dared them but don't don't get that don't get that confused he  didn't just come out out of nowhere and start saying fuck chuck lori no he was annoyed and i'm sure he  he was probably annoyed for a long time his emotions got the best of him and i think he felt like he 
[01:51:30]  was untouchable he felt like exactly you get a point you get to a point where you feel like you're  untouchable i hate to bring it back to us but me and aunt when we were at naw getting ridiculous  ratings for many many uh radio stations we truly felt untouchable like we were getting yelled at like  shut up you're not gonna fire us we felt untouchable you know why it's different for you two you two  guys and then the rules fucking long island assholes who weren't on but you were untouchable  we were but that's why i brought the uh the rules change and we didn't realize that at the time that 
[01:52:00]  the rules were actually changing in front of our eyes but we didn't want to see that we still thought  we were untouchable you still have an excuse though you have an excuse because what's our excuse your  excuse fucked up really bad not your excuse is that you're your actual human beings who have paved  a path for yourself so in reality you look at this game like we worked hard and we got to where we had  to be which was legitimate thought charlie sheen has been raised in this business man his father was a 
[01:52:30]  major player his brother was a major player he's not a fucking boob he knows what's going on in this  fucking game he's not like golly gee whiz i'm untouchable this guy knows the deal he overplayed  his hand i think you're wrong he overplayed his hand he thought he was untouchable it happened  because you get into that same too a little bit i think he overplayed his because nobody wants to  especially when you can get out of the gig nobody wants to walk away or get fired from a two million 
[01:53:00]  dollar a week gig and i say cakewalk because when we've had trouble here as much as i'll bitch about  management like this gig is a cakewalk compared to fucking all having to be on the road to make the money  it's like i love coming in here hanging with these dumbbells and having a good time it's like  the idea of losing this is fucking like fuck then you feel like you're floating on your own he's  never been fired publicly like that that's i'm telling you he's scared man because he's so when  he had to talk about so and so uh remember what he said he was on the phone he goes well i guess they 
[01:53:30]  they shouldn't have fired me like we heard him talk after that about the firing and you could tell he  was fucked up and crazy but he was also bothered by it yeah it was almost like they had done what he  dared them to do and he didn't i think it's i think it's both parts so i think he's he's kind of  you kind of rationalize it like ah good i'm free this opens up a whole so many possibilities and then  in the back of your mind like his his from the from the from the two million no no okay before he got  fired i'm just saying it the guy was doing something that's unheard of and and look man like let's move 
[01:54:00]  vez man he's a boss boss he's these guys if this was the mob dude yeah that's how you that's the  don look at it where's chuck lorry in the mob is he a coppo is he a ball these guys yeah they don't  give a fuck you're meat two million dollars a week and shit they offered seinfeld five million a week  then that was ten what ten years ago yeah probably ten right he's a he that means if they offered him 
[01:54:30]  five he was probably worth a million to them but to add to your discussion let's move as  paid charlie a visit was in his kitchen this is documented and said look man just  fucking you know back off a little bit reel it in a little bit because they uh they both  understand it like it's a mom he's like back off all he goes all i need to do is back off a little  i know what you're all about i don't need you sober and all that shit i just need you to back  the fuck off a little and charlie and charlie chose not to but but that's that's what we know 
[01:55:00]  there was still a chance that's what we that's what we were told that's what we know yeah you're  right about that fucking right about that if if if you heard a story that fucking uh uh mel carmeson  came and visited anthony at his house and it was just like he goes hey anthony like that guy is  the guy so he comes to you it's not it's not a fucking request but he didn't he didn't  fuck with less though he didn't fuck with sumner and he didn't fuck with less he's not a dumb you're 
[01:55:30]  right he was raised in this business but he also knows how far he could have sumner will  fucking will dump cruise he will dump charlie sheen sumner will fire anybody because he's 90 and  he doesn't give a fuck he felt like he knew how far he could take he felt like he could  fuck with that's something change maybe it is because of the drugs and the lack of sleep and  then his perception was off and then but he's but he was always that and it was the number one show  yeah on tv yeah what are they going to do now this is why this game is is um it's it's a gangster  business when we talk about the bridges i look my i try to keep my head low i do i try to be old crazy 
[01:56:00]  fat man and shit yeah yeah i'm not trying to really know what's going on dude because people ask you to  do things and they tell you to do things once you do once you do it it's like the mom it's the mom  hey do hey patrice do me a favor listen we're going to let you win an oscar if you just do this and you  go yeah so if you're an avarice person and you want it all yeah but i like i don't know i like 
[01:56:30]  more under the radar somehow banana is still live to be a ripe old age somehow who's the other the other  boss that lived to be a ripe old age uh um oh a fucking uh the uh the one who they thought was  crazy but it wasn't no no no the the boss boss yeah yeah carlo not that carlo the one in the  vince of the chin gigante no not the chin too but but but the the boss of the really the boss  paul castellano who was shot for that family the guy walking around in the bathroom oh the old 
[01:57:00]  one carlo gambino gambino lives to be like to figure out how to live to be a ripe old age in this game  is the same thing i look at this game like it's the mob man i'm telling it's it is a good way to  look at it i just stay as a couple and just go put in some work and i'm an earner i'm a good earner  but here's who charlie okay here's a great example charlie was joe pesci he's a made man  laurie was the jewish guy ace rothstein who he thought i'm a made man i'm better than him and i'm 
[01:57:30]  gonna tell you something ace rothstein fucking earned and they didn't give a fuck they didn't kill him  you cannot kill ace he wanted to fucking whack and he couldn't and that's what this was chuck look  because chuck lorry has fucking because charlie seen is a puerto reagan he's got it when it's all  boiled down mike and molly and he's got he's got three he's got three hit shows three big  three i can knock that guy out who's chuck what's his other show fucking uh  mike and molly big bang mike and molly that was a chuck lorry yes yes yeah well charlie sheen is 
[01:58:00]  somewhere in this fucking charlie i think charlie fucked up somewhere in a freezer hanging up  he's got four hit shows yeah i think he just made a bad move dude he allowed his craziness  they're not gonna knock that guy out ever especially since charlie was being unpredictable it was like  if we let him stay and he keeps going what if he self-destructs and what if a girl overdoses at his  house like then they start thinking that way what if a girl fucking dies in his house doing coke  then we have a public relations nightmare because everybody's like you saw it coming you saw it coming  they let him go if he would have just pulled fucking back and talked to them off the air and 
[01:58:30]  said look i've been a little crazy fuck it he would be fine that's my opinion jesus they also created  grace under fire sybil and darma and greg the guy makes a lot of money and where are all they  they're yeah where the fucking you heard grace on the fire was that bitch's name uh brett butler  you heard she was trouble yeah you ain't gonna see them no more we don't see them that's right  yes sir balls yeah yeah that's it shows were pretty fucking successful this guy's had a  a nice run you get your knuckles dirty that's what you do you either get your knuckles dirty 
[01:59:00]  or you try to move up in the game damn man and it's either sunny black or sunny red you're gonna  fucking chuck lorries to crack it and break it down he just miscalculated man i think  you're simplifying this too much man i don't i just there's something missing i can't argue but  there's something that ain't right about this onslaught of charlie sheen dude he probably 
[01:59:30]  this guy is powerful man he's also fucking don't forget he was smoking coke and he's on a long run  of a long partying run i don't think he's insane but you really do have delusions of grandeur when  you're doing that stuff i mean look at the insanity of doing that much coke and thinking you're going to  be okay and you're not going to drop dead i mean that's not a sane way to think that's that's a  fucking that's a loony way to think that alone and he literally was admitting he's on a cbs's  number one show and he's going i was smoking a lot of rocks and it's like okay you can do that but 
[02:00:00]  that's just a dumb thing to do knowing the business as well as you know it have if prior did what he  did but he was a stand-up and he was a fucking you know what i mean he didn't there's a difference  between prior was free too and all yes and and george carlman was a free man too sure because they were  on the road to meeting the beast you know what i mean the top of the chain but if you notice  richard prior and george carlman aren't famous for fame they're famous for the love and respect 
[02:00:30]  people have for their material so they made a lot of movies probably made a lot of movies  not one so he had to put them there though prior used to do little like he used to he did like lady  sings the blues which was a big it was a big like for the black community but in terms of  uh of 48 hours or beverly hills cop but he did never you know how big that fucking dumb movie  was sir crazy that was a great movie that was big again how huge was stir crazy i mean i love it but  how big was it for real that was pretty big at the time in sixth grade we were all walking around i 
[02:01:00]  remember when that came out me and my buddy were walking around going that's right that's right we  bad we were just doing the movie trailer and my grandmother took me to new york to see it oh  wow and she couldn't believe the language i'll never forget gene wilder quoting him going yes  i kept going shut up cunt i'm laughing but gene wilder was writing man i don't  fucking believe you and i was like oh fuck this bitch is gonna make me walk out but she didn't  she knew better oh wow she knew better that's uh that jerked me off under the popcorn box

[02:03:30]  i'm loving it so far it just sickens me it's just too it just it was too much too much i felt like  an old man i'm like this is just what is this shit too much too much and it wouldn't allow you to  sad to say i had to finally bail on the blackberry i went to my guy again and he's like dude it's over  he he threw up the the white flag the torch it's done i think the torch  fucked them over bad dude because i love blackberry and then and then the only thing i don't like  about this apple is uh a couple of details you know why didn't you wait till verizon came out 
[02:04:00]  with the new phone in a few months because they got that att and i need a phone now okay so so  sense no reason to say no reason to say that like i just asked a totally ludicrous question like  why do you why do you go to the bathroom once in a while i have to shit i gotta pee you  fucking ass off sorry that's that you're right i cursed him out for no reason pretty fair question  i think danny asked me that same question like he because danny said it not like a regular question  danny said it like men can poop it's coming out in a month and three days i'm like i'm not 
[02:04:30]  fucking technical guy but the iphone doesn't let you do things with like ringtones ringtones yeah  like i want to you can get ring right i like reading tones but they won't let you just take  it from your from your fucking your your itunes or something maybe they don't want you to be a  teenage girl they're looking out for you you don't need ring but it's the ones they give you go  i don't like that shit is that a cultural thing i i think yeah yeah i think white white people are 
[02:05:00]  fine with doodly doodly do black people love ringtones i think black people like ringtones more  than white people i'm not playing to be racial again money fast like if i had one i would i would  put sarah mclaughlin's born innocent as a ringtone runny-eyed animal song that fucking sad  bitch i didn't realize the song we are born innocent that song's called iada or ada or some  shit yeah she's just she's just miserable yeah but i wanted to get that as a ringtone 
[02:05:30]  oh my god why i don't know if the funeral parlor called you if who called you why would you have  this as your ring oh it'd be great if i should have every time bob calls just making everyone sad  around you when you're taking a call yes oh my god i just wanted to hook that's all how miserable is  this but she's a miserable bitch i don't know i know there's nothing happy going on in her life  who else do you want helen ready some anne murray mom what the fuck mom come on how can you not this 
[02:06:00]  here just the hook is good song it's beautiful man you wouldn't be answering the phone you'd just  be listening to the ringtone yeah it's like answer the phone yeah every time you pick up it's an animal  crying that should be your ringtone you too can help yeah dog with three legs thousands of animals  are needlessly put to death every day exactly you can help you take the phone out of your leather 
[02:06:30]  pocket my dog's skin bag picture a beaten a beaten kitten or a baby just listen to this and think of  a few men and picture your rug with kitten piss on it kicking it across the room to this song  that's i wanted to start off right there why would you do that to yourself every time the phone rings  yeah listen to this every once in a while it's all right but every time your phone rings yeah exactly  it's just remind you of things man you should have your phone remind you of things man are you 
[02:07:00]  are you going through menopause or something i might be yes i wake up crying  i can cry my uterus hurts my phone my phone does remind me of things every time it rings either oh  i have to talk to my girlfriend or i hope that's a massage girl who's gonna jerk me off it always  reminds me of i have an appointment coming up and how do you expect fame to call if you got that as  your ringtone fame is is blowing you off until you get a more i don't have it yet appropriate 
[02:07:30]  reason because the fucking iphone won't allow me to i even bought a ringtone app it's difficult to  do i don't i don't fucking yeah you know i just want better ringtones that's hilarious other than  that the iphones have been okay to me i don't know but i miss blackberry i do miss the blackberry got so  fucking dated though that little screen the fucking keys look it's right here that take a look at it  look at that thing and when you guys fucking watch videos on that when you guys were getting your  iphones i knew you guys were taking the lead but i'm like all right i'll hang in there because i know  blackberry is going to do the right thing and they're going to they're going to be right back 
[02:08:00]  in the game uh what is that yeah the uh the bold is the best the best phone i ever had yeah the one  you have uh the torch the torch they said don't fucking buy that you did my own cell phone guy told  me i'm i'm i'm sad i didn't think i don't click click click click that's the storm blackberry is  shit at&t is shit i would have went to verizon and gotten anything i would have got a fucking flip  phone from verizon that's what you have now no i have at&t but as soon as that verizon phone comes out  you understand i can't wait it's not out yet no but the new phone will be out over the summer 
[02:08:30]  oh okay i can't wait to fucking call them and go just say i'm done i wonder if enough people will  do that oh yeah they don't care a lot of people they they would rather like i i bought a new phone  before my uh upgrade time yeah and and they just wanted that little extra hundred they want their  money and i got on the phone and i'm like you know i try to really have these drawn out painful  conversations with you people on the phone you're fucking just working i want to psychologically 
[02:09:00]  just break them down like multiple migs i want i want them to quit that fucking job i want them to  feel what i'm feeling i swallow their own tongue just so they don't have to talk to you anymore so  maybe the next guy gets a little easier after they hang out with me  so a bitch goes uh quite frankly you sound like uh multiple migs not anymore no i make that anymore  i make it hurt i make them get off their script and everything if they want to talk to me here's 
[02:09:30]  what i do to him now here's what i do now go ahead man go ahead hello man do you know where we perform  a good wonderful customer service and we're going to do this man i'm june may i help you i'm sorry what  you say i i uh my phone was uh cut off how is it man shut up back there go ahead go ahead say what you  was going to say then i asked them do they force you to say that is that something they make you do 
[02:10:00]  you can't just say her well sir um which now they go would would you like me to call you um patrice  or mr o'neill it's like what do you what do you want to do  it's great having all the time what do you like to do well patrice i don't like that no i think mr  o'neill is mr o'neill and say it right don't say how you say sir to me i want you to say mr o'neill  mr o'neill can you imagine when you said what do you want to do if she fired out 
[02:10:30]  the atomic bomb and you had to do your phone thing while she addressed you as that  patrice will be fine miss no no we've committed to this  the boy's kind of stronger she developed a southern accent she sounded like rod steiger  i get a couple of them going though the at&t i go look can you just put somebody in the phone  as a human and just on a human i don't want to i don't want to quibble and haggle over 200 i want to 
[02:11:00]  get a new phone i don't want to leave at&t don't force me to leave at&t because i want a new phone  i don't want to pay 200 bucks i don't yeah just get them on the phone this 200 is a principle and if  you pay for any other method other than mailing it in or the internet you got to pay  fucking 495 if you do it over the phone with a person 495 so i said so of a million people this 
[02:11:30]  is you know some black girl in in shreveport port louisiana louisiana and i said do you get any  money like i said i said you know what i don't mind paying this to you because i you know good  because you need the money right because you figure y'all have what five million customers and for a  million customers paid over the phone like i'm doing that's five million what every month ah you get  some of that that's cool but i don't get any of that sir what they don't give you that all right 
[02:12:00]  this is just killing them psychologically oh yeah you are fucking them up beating them you are multiple  migs all she wants to do is go to lunch yes she doesn't want to do this her taking that job where  she fucking tells me i got to pay ten dollars a month for fucking the movie channel fucking despicable  fuck you oh i want to ask uh jimmy uh what his experience has been with verizon i haven't  switched yet fire why oh files you know what oh i want a cable one of the best phone calls ever made 
[02:12:30]  uh could you come this day and cut it off why sir i have a better service coming oh wow it's like  telling a chick you break it up with her because they're consistent how did they try to keep you they  didn't they's the guy was great oh they will call you back i'll say this but because you're dealing with  the fucking the drones you want to deal with the king b you want to get him i don't know enough  about fire shit i the app i don't know how to fire up because it said i need to have a thing installed 
[02:13:00]  but i do have a thing installed my box is installed so far the picture quality has been very good  the uh the guide is great comes up immediately i'm happy it's a little it's a little confusing  yeah i'm not good with it yet but i will get the hang of it how do i how do i fucking uh activate  the app on the ipad i have this app that's not activated what the fuck do i do really you just  got to sign up for your account online but i did already to tell me i don't have a set box  the fuck's his set box what's that was a chick that you know you can fuck  i don't punch him in the side of the head 
[02:13:30]  come on i liked it come on i didn't like it but i just i really did just make that one  i hate him for saying it you're all right technically i liked it  like yeah so what in stores now it's all in the delivery it's all in the delivery  i just want to whoop his ass for that shit  but i really don't know how to sign up for it i did i did i have an account online and i'm trying  fucking files i probably could yeah they're pretty good they'll walk you right through it 
[02:14:00]  it should be fairly easy i'm waiting to see how jimmy likes he walking around  like a nasa scientist he's got his uh jimmy well i came from i came from a trip  his ipad and his macbook pro i want to know how jimmy's files is because i'm waiting and then i'm  going to get it i'm waiting for for you to have it for a week or two to see the pluses and the minuses  i predict this it took him a long time to hook it up because it's brand new in the building  there's a couple of quirks in the system but the techs were great like when i was annoyed that they  had that someone in the office had messed up my appointment and and not yeah but but the tech 
[02:14:30]  guys got it fixed they were great um and y'all can't do direct tv in your building right they  can't have a bunch of we probably can't who wants it i want fios light yes the speed of light i want  light i want light i don't want cables and copper it's like what do you have it's like that it's  pretty funny i got time right now i hate it light that's fucking carrier pigeon but do you hate it or  you just hate the arrogance i hate it my fucking internet pops off at least two or three times a 
[02:15:00]  week i gotta reset that and then uh like ant jokes about with the grrr is happening more and  more i don't know what the pixelated picture where he goes well i thought we would go to the uh  restaurant and the new thing it's all pixelated and the sound fucks up and the new thing which  has only happened the last six months or so the audio just drops out without the that's great for  about five seconds that's great just drops out how do we they've overextended their system is  is that what that is you know what's very funny though their nodes are all full these people 
[02:15:30]  created a system for us to really enjoy ourselves and we're like fuck you you sons of bitches and  it's like where's the other guy that invented tv for me like you know why we're lucky there's not  only just time warner right i'll answer that question when when cable was only twenty dollars a  month who gives a fuck we're paying a lot of money for their service and it's a bad and their service  i'm paying the 200s man i'm in the 200s what patrice was saying earlier though where you want to say 
[02:16:00]  fuck you and get fucked by the new person that was my logic for initially getting fios i was at uh  i was getting cable vision and i was with cable vision since cable came to long island like  fucking a million years ago it was only with a small black box just with the two buttons with  the two buttons and a key on it you got to turn a key like the same size as the thing on the tv yeah  i i was there like since then and then i realized why the fuck have i been so loyal to this company 
[02:16:30]  when they've done nothing but fuck me over not take care of my customer service problems nothing just  nothing so i got files and and i called i canceled they came back they came back and tried to get me  back they were like we will give you six months free just come back and i went no there's no you  know what that's our egypt and our lebanon is one day we're just gonna all stand up and and just say no 
[02:17:00]  fuck a company fuck yeah fuck you but it goes back to the loyalty loyalty thing which makes me laugh  every time it's the chinese restaurant all over again i've been with you since you invented cable  you can't throw in one channel for a little while or do something i can't believe they was gonna just  stop the pixelating give me a coupon something i talked to this guy for and then i got to the point  too i i know who the fuck is gonna be good or not on the phone like i know exactly uh like who's 
[02:17:30]  perfect on the phone i would say any if i hear an older white woman it chances are to be decent yeah  if i hear any straight man chances are to be a decent right uh-huh gay guys horrific on the  phone bad bad customers gay white and then trickle down to gay black gay puerto rican it's bad news i can't  help black girls it's a crap shoot you might get one that's you can't get one phenomenal yeah one in 
[02:18:00]  a million or one that says fuck you but a lot of times it's just every problem i've ever had has been  like did you unplug the set time box did you plug it back in they go down the flow chart and then go to  the back and read me the ime yeah yeah i'm not fucking yanking this out the wall you if you want  to turn it off you just put your button yeah yeah push the stupid button what do you think i got this  shit sitting on a tv tray in front of my uh yeah tv you you got the info right in front of you push the 
[02:18:30]  fucking button this shit's installed professionally in a fucking cabinet i ain't gonna start looking in  the back with a flashlight on my head it's in the wall bitch i don't know what the ime number is  can't get files can't get me why they don't got my islanders and uh now that i'm a fan of the nicks  again no nicks in hd can't do it what why don't they have that in hd yet contractual stuff yeah  because cable vision owns msg owns msg it's their fucking fault yeah verizon actually took them to 
[02:19:00]  court to because cable vision purposely will not give them those hd channels it's rough to watch uh  service and they're trying to fuck people getting a good service i i need my nicks and islanders in hd  so you said fuck cable vision no i was with time warner but i said fuck them and it felt wonderful  because the same things anthony talked about yeah they would double charge me for pay-per-views  they were that fucking noise that my internet would crap out and i want light do you understand i  went lickety-split i want fucking quick i don't want to share my fucking connection i want light 
[02:19:30]  could you describe light for everybody i pushed the button and there it is fast  that's light how am i gonna download fast downloaded whoa that's how i wanted internet  really super fast fast yeah that's fast do we need faster yes we do yeah yes you're trying  jerking off and the fucking scene is just halfway there and then the fucking the girl at the adam's  apple is just lifting her dress up you're like oh for pete's sake and you get a buffering situation  and here's a here's how fucking cool uh here's how cool the verizon the files people were they 
[02:20:00]  oh you have files now oh yeah yeah i fucking told cable vision to take a fuck hike just get out of  here and uh they had to come take all their fucking equipment away i don't like the way you almost used  an old lady expression but through and fuck you were gonna say take a hike but you realize how  fucking awful that was take a fuck hike take a long as a man of leisure you should just maybe you  should just call i would i would call probably for a good month and just and just let them know well 
[02:20:30]  occasionally they come back they come back and try to get me to come back and i i talk with them and i  i love talking very calm cool i tell them uh i go no your service just wasn't good and they go we'll  give you this this i go you can tell me you're giving me lifetime cable for free i go you could  tell me that why do i want something bad for free when i could pay what i want for something good  and they get so but you got to be careful if files gets it gets really popular because then 
[02:21:00]  it'll be the same they'll go that way they got to look that and the service will be bad  they can't help themselves they all go that you know you know what they did though here's what they did  for me it was great i i was having a problem i was like wait a minute i'm i'm noticing the same  pixelation i was getting with cable vision when i first had files installed i was like  motherfucker what the fuck is it i called them up they came by did all kinds of tests on the line  and they said they said something like you got more data flowing in and out of your house than norad

[02:29:30]  the worst movie you'd all be done if it wasn't for my son david here's the part i can't get past  it's a will smith part oh this alien who's who single-handedly was destroying area 51 with his mind  yeah and his and his and his and his giant suit his suit that encases him and makes him impenetrable  yeah will smith punched him in the face punched him and said welcome and knocked him out and then 
[02:30:00]  and then it killed doctors yeah choked the guy made him talk through his mind almost killed the  president with his mind right and will smith not didn't knock the alien out knocked out his outfit  to where he he thought he knocked out this is where he assumed the alien's chin would be  that he could knock this guy because the we have the same those aliens have the same nerves 
[02:30:30]  where if you get hit in the temple it it came out with fearsome evil and then it just and then he  dragged it through this this knocked out alien in a suit you hated that i'm taking it please tell me  yeah that i could not get past yes some of the things that bothered me about that movie but the  first the first when the when it comes over the moon with the fucking very cool this this this race of  aliens who fucking travel through the solar system and the size of those things and 15 miles it was 
[02:31:00]  there i loved it i hate saucy lines like this but patrice in all fairness when i saw this in the  theater this was this was a clap break the thing is it was those dummies i hate clap breaks in movies  where everyone feels like oh yes welcome to earth that's why i'm not a movie maker so maybe you needed  that but i fucking that's when i started to hate the movie because i love what you love the 
[02:31:30]  the fucking graphics the idea of it and they cornballed it up you don't need to do that and  randy quaid should never be allowed to make a movie again oh no he stinks in everything it was so bad  bill pullman's bill pullman his decision on how to act in that movie that destroyed  he says we will not go quietly into the night his big speech at the uh uh uh did they do clinics when he  he sounded like the fucking yeah they all love billsy whales i fucking hated him he goes the kid 
[02:32:00]  goes daddy let me stay up all night you let her stay up all night traitor he he well i see it's been  coming on cable i there's some movies you know you got to watch i've seen it that independence day  comes on yes it i don't know why when the moon is shaking and this fucking race of creatures is  coming to kill us all when the fish ship finally gets me breaks through the cloud with the fire 
[02:32:30]  because it's like for a while like it's just smoky cloudy and the music everybody stops in new york it  was so how it would be but you know you know who sucked in the beginning though oh my god i got to call  my psychiatrist it's like forget my lawyer get it because we hate our that's how a flamboyant  old gay guy would act if the aliens were attacking i didn't you didn't mind that as much i didn't mind 
[02:33:00]  i love judd what's his name no you didn't know that's what the that's what the who he be kike burger  that was the worst parody of a jewish guy  that was horrible be careful you're trying to get on two and a half men remember jews couldn't  have liked that picture picture picture picture his name was rufus johnson rufus johnson rufus 
[02:33:30]  johnson rufus johnson rufus johnson rufus johnson rufus johnson rufus johnson he was going why didn't  y'all hand me some chicken for the aliens it was that bad huh y'all sure handed me some chicken for  the aliens were embarrassed by that role they had to be but he was jewy i've seen jews like that that's  my david that's my david that's my david we did it show us your cock show us it's cut we got  you joe got it you didn't need it he could have downplayed that and just it was it was so over 
[02:34:00]  the top it was distracting you walked right into that patrice oh you walked right into that i love  jared hirsch in taxi he he he he kike burger it was a caricature of a jewish guy you don't have to do  that and the generals are like listening to him on the plane yeah yeah yeah oh listen  the old jewish guy 51 but he didn't but i'm telling we've been making fun of that for years  man bill pullman was terrible the movie to me other than bill pullman's decisions yeah it's it's i the 
[02:34:30]  first i still get excited at the build-up to the fact that these aliens are going to yeah that was  great i'm a pilot i belong up there oh wait wait a minute wait a minute here's another thing will  smith did he goes they go what are we gonna do man he goes sir this is when they decide to attack the  ship i'm well aware of their maneuvering capabilities i'm going i'm well aware of trains and how they 
[02:35:00]  fucking did you just say i'll fly the ship to the fucking to the mothership this is lazy writing  i'll fly on what but on nothing he said i'm well aware of their maneuvering kit i know how dc 10s  i've seen them in the sky you're fucking gonna fly a spaceship to the giant mothership based on 
[02:35:30]  you seen them i that it there's a couple i'm telling you the alien the the fucking alien  who destroyed the doctors yeah who had three other ones in water  water in his in his outfit yeah in his outfit in his outfit and he punches him in the face it was  awful but you love the movie love the first time dude dude you don't understand was there some nice 
[02:36:00]  catchphrases in that movie not even one catchphrase that that stands what's with this area 51 they  could have bargained down to area 15 what's with this he's my david if i know i was meeting the  president maybe i would have dressed yes i would have eaten cocoa i wouldn't have dressed like a  shrimp meal i'm not gonna let it i'm not gonna let it make me feel like face off you hate you i could  have been eating cocoa why would i do this you know what what this is very nice this is very this is 
[02:36:30]  social could you find something again because there's anything there i to me and i guess you  know what makes me understand what he's doing now makes me see something when i see a black person  they got him acting fucked up maybe other people just don't see where that's bad yeah where he wasn't  he be he drew to me that's what they are to me that would have been like if they had a gay guy 
[02:37:00]  if they had a gay guy if harley firestein's character which was way over the top that said  well i have to get out of here let me shove everything in my asshole and run out backwards  with my small dog let me run out with my sick friend and my small dog and my things in my  asshole coming i'm good get it got it got it this is not checkmate this is not checkmate yes but that  didn't bother you no no that didn't bother you you said he was my david but that didn't bother you 
[02:37:30]  no no no not the first time i saw everything he says bothers me now because i know where it's going  judd hurt yeah he didn't bother you but he did yes he did like like now when i watch the movie i think of  that later on judd hers and it translates into the beginning so now right from the beginning i hate it  here's something here's something black that might that might have bothered black people but white  people wouldn't even why is she a stripper oh why is vivica fox a fucking was that's life she could  have been a nurse right that's how unimportant being a stripper if if something in the movie happened 
[02:38:00]  where the aliens seen her titties and didn't attack right okay it's like wait the reason it was  because no no you see uh uh uh uh uh her boyfriend i know what you're gonna say but it had  nothing to do with it it had nothing to do wanted to be an astronaut they could have just said no  because he's a nigger they didn't have to add that she was a nah we ain't let no niggas in space 
[02:38:30]  i was thinking maybe it was because they have that touching scene uh with the president's wife when  the president's wife is dying they wanted to show like how even like they could connect on that kind  of a level like oh you could have did that if she was just a nigglin by herself you know what i'm  saying that's the cheesiness of the movie like that's why they were going oh you're a dancer  oh ballet she goes no it was just for that scene i show my cunt for money first lady who i'd never  be really next to in real life and that's another thing she's got internal injuries and they just let 
[02:39:00]  her die they weren't even trying to help her the first lady died the first lady and she's in the alien  hospital she's got color to her she's moving around and they're like there's nothing we could do  internal bleeding you try something she died of internal bleeding they didn't even try i was so  happy when she died i didn't feel sad i was hoping it was contagious and everyone would get it except  for the aliens bill pullman walks out of the place and he's just like is mommy sleeping yeah yeah she's  sleeping and then he looks at the kid he's down he looks at the kid and goes your mouthwash ain't 
[02:39:30]  making it go ahead make my day i'm going to do all of his lines bill pullman the second half of i i  turn off uh it's just like pulp fiction anything that sam jackson is not in not interested yeah i'm  i'm just serious i i i can't watch sam jackson and he has to be in every scene that's why i like  this may be sacrilegious but this is why i like jackie brown better than pulp fiction because sam 
[02:40:00]  jackson it was you know good sam jackson jackson was a ruthless motherfucker and and that entire  movie was sam jackson no one that movie up for me pulp fiction but but uh independence day  the first 45 minutes to an hour when it's like time's up  but there were things happening at this point though yeah yeah that could have made them go 
[02:40:30]  let's get the fuck out of here um up to this point when they weren't communicating yeah yeah they were  just sitting there with giant ships placement all over the fucking globe perhaps and it's something  else that fucking six hour drive from new york new york that they made in four hours during the escape  from alien like they just it's some things they were very lazy vivica fox lived during this firestorm of 
[02:41:00]  10 billion degrees this cleansing fire this was the only one that knew to kick that door in  and her dog live and what kind of asbestos room is she in what the like there were things she lived  but then she got mesothelioma dude the beginning of that movie was spectacular man i i still to this  day it's it's my favorite first half of a fucking it's a great i agree with patrice on that we 
[02:41:30]  hear a little bit of jet hershey what about uh full metal jacket as as as far as first that's another  first half yeah first half why aren't you stopping private piles god sound but should private  potty will be in some power i think the second half i thought first animal mother is one of my  favorite cat really adam baldwin i love adam baldwin underrated guys great like classy brown and he  stands over this dead guy who died like jerking off or something and everybody's like we're gonna miss  him i love you and he goes better you than me and he was in independence day too yeah adam bald but

[02:42:30]  talking like this what to like a white person that doesn't know it's like what's your problem  if he was italian he would wait don't get aliens and beat  he's like i don't know i get jersey show me put the big up caps on the spaceship they're right  around with my mother sauce oh veto ain't that them that's true that's the women all right also 
[02:43:00]  making the list stripes first half of stripes oh yeah yeah yeah and then it got really good i just  watched it oh and then it got weird and serious those movies where the first half was great but  we got the audio when fucking when they all get in trouble for mud wrestling and i just saw the scene  again and and and john larriquette wants an explanation and john can't is like well sir we  got on our way to bingo a parlor and directions get all fouled up and he goes shut up okay sir okay  sir that big fat head okay okay sir oh it's great shut up so this is here here yes here let's hear 
[02:43:30]  him you're going to kill them and us at the same time if we fire nukes and everybody else who's  got it you know what that means fall out your nuclear winter it's the end of life as we know  hold on pause right there he actually skated in on penny shoes  i wear penny shoes not penny loafers he already looks really  of course he does he's thinking what can i say that sounds jewish he hasn't even talked yet and  you can tell he's he's very jewish yes he's actually reading a book 
[02:44:00]  key for tea for tea for thorn i'm not gonna let them i'm not gonna let them make me  fucking hate john hershen in his business before you before you get to kikki he here  kikberg uh uh there there's also what's that other actor that was in there jeff goldblum no  no robert loscha yeah robert loscha that one thing where he goes get on the horn let's tell them  Tell them how to bring them sons of bitches down.  It's so overdramatic. 
[02:44:30]  Tell them how to bring those sons of bitches down.  I think I know every line in that fucking movie.  And know which ones I hate.  A thousand times.  And sometimes I got to turn away from the TV because I'm too embarrassed to look at it.  Let's see what fucking...  Oh, he'd be kind of perfect.  Here he comes.  He looks Jewish already.  He walked in looking ethnic.  It can't be allowed.  I'm trying to get him out of here.  Hey, hey, don't tell him to shut up.  We can't even listen because we're going to laugh. 
[02:45:00]  Don't tell him to shut up.  No one is this Jewish.  You'll be dead now if it wasn't my David.  None of you did anything to practice.  Wait a minute, time out.  Where's his penis?  Can someone Jewish please tell me if this is wrong?  Is this a wrong Jew?  There aren't Jewish guys like that, but it was such an obvious stereotype.  He should be walking through the desert with a fuckload of Jews behind him. 
[02:45:30]  He could have just walked in and said, hey, don't talk to him that way.  You'd be dead without him.  What was the most Jewy thing he did?  Every word.  Every syllable.  Every syllable.  It's the cadence.  You can't fuck this up.  Dude, if he wore a shirt with Israel on it, it couldn't have been as over-the-top Jewish.  How about vultures?  You're vultures?  They're vultures?  Let's listen to the whole scene.  Try to get through the whole scene.  We dead now if it wasn't my David.  None of you did anything to prevent this. 
[02:46:00]  There's nothing we could do.  We were totally unprepared for this.  Don't get me unprepared.  Come on, children.  It was what?  In the 1950s or whatever.  You had that spaceship.  Pause.  Why are the generals entertaining this old Jewish guy?  Why were they listening to him with his stupid beard?  There was nothing we could do.  Why does he have to justify himself then?  They should have said, go take your orders from fucking Louis De Palma, stupid.  Beat it.  Beat it.  Get Jim Norton in here. 
[02:46:30]  He could have done a better job.  Fucking solid old.  The 50s.  The 50s.  Area 51.  Watch Robert Loge's face.  When he says Area 51.  Yeah.  That thing that you found in New Mexico.  Back, please.  Oh, that thing that you found in the thing.  Please rewind that.  I have to hear that.  I have to hear that fucking.  That thing that you found.  That thing that you found in the desert.  Let's hear it.  Don't get me unprepared. 
[02:47:00]  It was what?  In the 1950s or whatever.  You had that spaceship.  That thing that you found in New Mexico.  That.  What was it?  Not the spaceship.  Was it Roswell?  Roswell, New Mexico.  Yeah.  No, you had the spaceship.  And you had the bodies.  They were all locked up in a bunker.  That was it.  David.  I don't know.  Area 51, right?  Area 51.  You knew then.  And you did nothing.  Why didn't somebody put that up as a great clip?  There's someone that loved that enough or hated it enough. 
[02:47:30]  I'll tell you the best part of that clip at the end when the guy silently.  Oh, John Church is hilarious.  Here's the best part of that clip.  The end of it.  When the guy silently stands up from the couch.  Rewind right there.  I'll show you the best part of the clip.  Watch.  Danny, just go back a little bit.  Watch.  Here we go.  The best part of this clip.  Right there.  Bill Pullman almost stands up.  Standing up.  He's like, ugh.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what they did to that fucking film.  I'm so mad.  I completely agree with Patrice on that. 
[02:48:00]  It could have been an amazing movie.  When the fucking, after the destruction, it was like, when it was just quietly destroyed  the earth.  Yeah, yeah.  And it just closed back up.  And then we get to that scene.  How does it go from that to that scene?  You know what they should have did?  Judd Hurst should have come into that room with a fucking yellow Star of David on his striped shirt.  This is why I'm excited about Battlefield Los Angeles.  This is what the hope is.  This is where this began.  Oh.  Yeah.  This is what the hope is.  Is that it will be what the end of Independence Day should have been, where they was preparing 
[02:48:30]  for the invasion.  The invasion, right.  And this is almost to me like, I'm hoping it's Independence Day 2, where they actually  get on the earth and invade.  Right.  And do you think Myers-Sheckleford will save the day?  Oh.  They're invading.  Yes, they're running.  You knew then, and you did nothing.  You knew then?  What was that place down the street from the kosher deli that you're not sure if I'm Jewish?  I'll say it again.  Why not? 
[02:49:00]  Why don't we seek the monster after him?  You know, the Loch Ness monster.  I don't know.  You knew then?  There's a monster in the Loch Ness.  What is that place?  I said it once, but I'll say it was a heavier accent.  Oh, yeah.  See you, Stephen.  What was it?  That place?  Oh, yeah.  We got it.  We understand you.  A bar mitzvah.  It's okay.  Patrice has officially been knocked out.  He's downed out.  Because that's one of the things I hated. 
[02:49:30]  Did he have one of yarmulks?  No.  No, he put one on, though.  He didn't, because he didn't feel it was Jewish enough.  Jesus Christ.  He put a yarmulke on when it was in praying.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He goes, but I'm not Jewish.  Some guy goes, I'm not Jewish.  Nah.  Nobody's perfect.  Is there any, please, we have one more clip of that fucking...  But I hated him in that.  I hated fucking the president.  I hated everyone.  Even Will Smith, who I think is a really good actor, but doing that fucking, that stupid,  wacky lines, you don't need them. 
[02:50:00]  You don't need cop-buddy movie lines.  Just shucking and jiving while he's flying the fighter plane.  Oh, no, you don't!  What are you doing?  You know what?  He did, in terms of deuce chills.  Yeah.  Oh, no, you didn't shoot that green shit at me.  Right.  It, why...  You can be humorous, right?  Again, I'm just saying from a fan of movies.  Yeah, yeah.  Why didn't...  Why wasn't it real?  If they, why did they have to...  Because they suck. 
[02:50:30]  You did not shoot...  Shoot that green shit at me.  First of all, they attacked the ship.  Yeah.  That the...  It swallowed up the missiles.  Yeah.  It didn't even explode.  They went boink, boink, boink, boink.  Yeah.  And people were dying.  And they would pull up and his boy died.  Yeah.  And, and no, you didn't shoot that green shit at me.  Gives me the fucking creep.  Especially the scene that they cut out, which was when Judd Hirsch saw that, he goes,  The green!  Isn't that liquid money? 
[02:51:00]  They're shooting liquid money?  My David would have drank it?  Let me put this on.  Can you seize this?  I'm praying.  What?  You gotta love...  Wait a minute, though.  All right.  Can we agree that, uh, uh, uh, what's his name?  His son.  David?  Jeff Goldblum?  Jeff Goldblum.  Jeff Goldblum.  Goldblum was flawless.  I like him.  He did nothing, douche chili.  No, he's just Jeff Goldblum.  He's weird and everything.  But he was, he was excellent.  I thought everything he did, where he goes, where you, you know, so you guys can go up 
[02:51:30]  there and, and do your thing, and, and, um, do your thing.  And, um, take it, uh, take it down.  I thought he was excellent.  Yeah, I love Jeff Goldblum.  But to me, is there any more Judd Hirsch, Danny?  I'm on YouTube.  Oh, for Pete's sake.  Could we vote on somebody to get out of Independence Day and, and, and.  Yes, whoever wrote it.  Yeah.  Yeah, the writing fell apart.  Like, you've, uh, yeah, you've got your point.  I would say the president was horrible.  Bill Pullman stunk.  I thought Will Smith stunk.  And, and, because, like, when he, in, in Men in Black 2 or whatever, when he, when he 
[02:52:00]  jumped down, he goes, Reign in Black, folks.  I'm like, what are you doing with that shit line?  Why don't you make the guy who's a great actor a real fucking soldier or a real fucking  guy who, like he said, there's humor in it, but it doesn't have to be shucking jive humor.  It doesn't have to be the over-the-top Jewish guy to make Jewish people seem compassionate.  Stupid.  You know what was funny in the movie, and the funny was perfect, was the guy.  Say Randy Quaid and I'll break my computer over your teeth.  No.  He didn't bother me, by the way. 
[02:52:30]  The kids bother me more.  He didn't bother you?  But wait a minute.  Do we have a clip?  The guy who played the robot in, in Star Trek, uh, Next Generation.  Data?  Data.  The guy who played the, oh, the, the doctor guy.  The doctor.  Yeah, yeah.  Is a character that's funny within his own weirdness.  It wasn't.  Yeah, because he's been just locked away and there's so long a weirdo.  So you laugh at that kind of shit, but the, but oh no, you didn't shoot that green shit  at me.  Just, to this day, I gotta turn the TV down when that scene comes.  Oh, that was him?  I didn't know that was him. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And by the way, the, I, I thought it was genius where they tied in Area 51 and they  did have a ship that they could, like, get some, like, knowledge from.  Like, I thought that it could have been, like, the concept of that was great.  There was some things where they just said, fuck it.  Yeah.  They just said, fuck it.  How do we kill these aliens?  We just blow their ship up with a, with a ship that they, wait a minute.  Why would they bring, wait a fucking minute.  Why would that giant ship bring in that little one from fucking Earth when they all go on the 
[02:53:30]  big ones that's already down there?  Why would they fly into space and they go, oh, it's a little one just chilling.  Let's bring them right in and dock them right in front of me with the fucking missile.  And ain't that the 1950s model?  These motherfuckers don't even have the 2000 model fucking little ship.  That's pretty funny.  And they, and they don't, and they fucking can't tell that someone, that would literally 
[02:54:00]  be like a turtle driving an Edsel into your garage.  How would you not know?  Driving.  Maybe he won't know this.  Yeah, all right.  Let's go outside.  The turtle with the gun wants to shoot us from the Edsel.  It just could have been so real.  I just, it just, they could have kept it so, so good.  Not the best over the top two of all time.  Really?  What were they saying?  Not the best.  Patrice should know this one.  I don't know.  You should know this one.  I don't know. 
[02:54:30]  All right.  We'll go right for the answer, but a movie we saw together.  Scooter in Illinois.  No, but no.  Wait, Scooter.  Wait, Scooter.  Before you say it, wait.  Wait, Scooter.  That was supposed to.  Of course.  Of course.  John was supposed to be dead serious.  Of course.  That's the difference.  Okay.  Okay.  We do know that's the difference.  Not over the top, but maybe the greatest Jew character of all time.  This guy with this guy.  The greatest over the top Jewish character of all time.  Done on purpose.  That's the difference, Scooter.  But go ahead.  Hey, boys.  How y'all doing today?  Good. 
[02:55:00]  I think the best Jewish character played was Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder.  We howled.  Remember how we laughed?  We laughed.  But it was supposed to be.  Les Grossman was hilarious.  That was supposed to be.  No, I know.  That's what we just said.  We said that.  And it was so racist.  I don't even think this one is trying to be racist.  No, he's just trying to play an authentic Jew guy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  He's not trying to be.  He's not the old school Jew guy.  Les Grossman was maybe the most racist character I fucking...  It was so racist, I was getting nervous.  Yeah.  Like, oh, boy.  Someone's going to lose their job. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  I was like, I was getting nervous.  To agree to this.  Oh.  Also, another movie that had a great first half.  Blazing Saddles.  Makes the list.  You know what?  Fuck.  When that fucking movie ends up in the catering hall or whatever the fuck.  It's like a Warner Brothers back studio.  Mel Brooks kind of gets weird.  Spaceballs was like that, too.  Just falls apart.  They didn't know how to end that.  What happened?  They didn't know how to end that fucking movie.  They didn't know how to end it.  Young Frankenstein was like weird.  They should have called David.  David would have ended it properly for them. 
[02:56:00]  They should have known.  You know what I mean?  David.  I like Joe.  No, you know.  I refuse.  You're not going to get me.  Watch him again, and everything he says, you're going to go, ugh.  So this is just based on the fact the new movie's coming out Friday.  Battle Los Angeles.  Skyline had a great trailer.  It was horrific.  Yeah, that was a bomb.  I never even saw it.  If I see that fucking Brett Ratner again, I'm going to punch him in his stomach.  He knew.  You could see it in his eyes.  He was like, ugh. 
[02:56:30]  Maybe we'll get him.  I'm going to get him.  Maybe we'll get a nice opening.  I'm going to fucking put him in chokehold.  We didn't know.  We just talked about the trailer with that guy.  I go, wow, the fucking trailer was amazing.  What was that?  Skyline?  Skyline.  Were you here for that?  No.  No.  For Brett, I was away.  He's a great guy.  He's a cool guy.  He had a lot of good stories.  Yeah, I like Brett Ratner, but he was pretty much telling us the movie sucked.  I don't think he was.  He was pushing it.  Yeah, he pretty much was.  Was he?  Yeah, he was talking about special effects a little too much.  He was saying how cheap they are to make and the kind of return that you get on such 
[02:57:00]  a cheap product.  But those guys are doing Battlefield Los Angeles.  But I thought the effects was great, though.  In that movie.  In Skyline.  In Skyline.  But the movie was just bad.  Also, Patrice playing Caroline's Thursday through Sunday, 2-1-2-7-5-7-4-100.  These things are going to go fast, but you want to talk NBA for a second.  Oh, Miami Heat.  Yeah, there's a big turnoff for some of these people, but all the people like to hear basketball  talk on the show.  Yeah, I get some Twitterers that I have to block when I'm doing sports.  I have to get rid of them.  They don't fucking make decisions on what I like, motherfucker.  You like the Knicks? 
[02:57:30]  They're having kind of a schizo run.  Losing to the Cavaliers twice, but...  Yeah, but I mean, you gotta...  Look, I don't give a shit about the Knicks, but I'm gonna say, you gotta be happy.  You gotta be happy...  I'm a fan again, officially.  Yeah, I mean, you gotta be happy that they have two relevant guys that scored 30 points  by the third quarter and left.  Yeah, they sat last night.  They killed them.  But here's my thing about Miami, alright?  If anybody in Miami is listening, this is why...  They're not gonna win the championship, man.  It's gonna make me so fucking happy.  No, they're not gonna...  They can't win unless this happens. 
[02:58:00]  And this is why they can't win, because they're trying to blame...  You're gonna fix the heat.  And everything.  They're talking about getting Pat Riley.  It doesn't matter.  To fucking do a little time on the bench.  Here's the problem.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  It's okay.  LeBron James, okay?  There's no player boss on the team.  LeBron James is so good that he can't be the second guy.  He's so good and so talented, he has to be the first guy.  He doesn't want to be the first guy. 
[02:58:30]  He wants to be the second guy.  But he's too good to be the second guy.  So here's what fucking Wade and fucking Chris Bosh have to figure out.  They have to look at themselves like the Bulls.  Jordan, Pippen, and Horace Grant, okay?  Or Dennis Rodman.  Even though they all were great, everyone knew Jordan was the fucking boss.  Here's what Wade and Bosh have to understand that they're gonna be.  They're gonna be really super good role players.  So when you look at the role, look at the Cleveland Cavaliers when it was LeBron, Mo Williams, and fucking Varazal, okay? 
[02:59:00]  Those guys are role players, but they weren't that talented.  So you go, these guys are role players, and they knew their role.  Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade have to be super duper role players, and LeBron has to lead that team.  But if LeBron doesn't lead the team, this is where Pat Riley might be.  He comes in, and he tells them, he goes, look, LeBron's the boss.  Isn't that gonna be pissed off Wade? 
[02:59:30]  It doesn't matter, because Pat Riley has that kind of...  Well, then you got that conflict with him.  He got that kind of generalness about him, like a leadership, where he goes, here's how it's gonna be.  But LeBron cannot be number two like he wants to be.  And you do realize those two will end up hating each other.  They won't if Wade...  But that's not gonna happen.  If Wade relinquishes the fact that he's not the guy.  There's gonna be an ego thing happening.  It's not a competition.  LeBron's better than everybody except for Kobe Bryant. 
[03:00:00]  He's the boss on every team except for if Kobe Bryant's on the team.  And he's trying to play second best on that team.  He's trying to give away the ball.  He's trying to do...  Wade is now a role player.  And Chris Bosh is a fucking hyper, supercharged, rebounder, and kind of scorer.  They're not...  It never fails.  There's no team in the history of the NBA where you wondered who the boss was. 
[03:00:30]  The Lakers?  Magic.  The Celtics?  Bird.  Detroit?  Isaiah.  They were the boss.  This team is Wade or is...  It can't be that.  That's why they're not gonna win.  I disagree because I always thought that Wade's defense was the problem.  And that the boss needed to start passing the ball a little bit more.  Shut up, asshole.  Wade's defense was weak.  No, no, no.  But King James...  You know what?  I thought LeBron James was being a role player, too.  I needed to say that because I can't say it on Mike and Mike. 
[03:01:00]  So I just wanted to say it because I was thinking about it of why they're not gonna win.  And they can't win.  I like your thoughts on that.  I don't disagree, but I think that if you're gonna have a role player...  I'm just gonna say...  Hey, I think Bosh has to really just settle down and accept his role.  But is Wade gonna tolerate that?  Well, will the coaching staff even get back to him?  See, that's what you hear on talk radio.  Sports talk and it works.  So don't even laugh.  It's the same goofy shit.  You know?  If you had a call today, who wins the NBA championship?  Tough question, obviously.  Right now? 
[03:01:30]  Right now.  If you had a call.  The fucking black Celtics, man.  You think the Celtics got...  They're better than everybody else.  Right now.  Even with those weird trades you weren't happy with.  I hate them trades, but I look at this kid, Gerald Green, and he's big.  Yeah, but Gerald Green, is he gonna get it done in the postseason?  I mean, that's the thing.  He's untested.  I mean, how many guys are tested in the postseason?  And is the coaching staff gonna make that happen?  Yeah, back to you.  This is it, though.  I don't know.  But I mean, is the coaching staff gonna do that?  That is them.  And then you gotta go, I'll hang up and let you comment.  Yeah, you comment.  I mean, I don't know. 
[03:02:00]  What do I...  You know, I don't think so.  And then the host has to make something out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Make something out of that mess.  Oh, fuck.  I gotta untangle this shit.  Yeah, but Wade and Bosch.  Back to them.  What the hell?  If Green thinks he can get it done, let's see what he does when he mixes up with those  guys in the postseason.  Sports Jimmy, what about the Knicks?  What about the Knicks?  You know, come on.  They're having a tough time this year.  We all know why.  It doesn't need to be said.  Oh, my God.  Defense, defense.  They're giving up too many points off the board, and they're not doing rebounds.  They're not doing rebounds.  They're not passing the ball enough.  Everybody wants to be the boss.  Everybody wants to be the boss.  But they can't rebound the ball. 
[03:02:30]  The defense is not good.  It's not good anymore.  Wade and Bosch, different story.  Like I said, Wade's defense is terrific.  Bosch not doing a good job at all.  And King James has got to learn to be number three.  That's what I just said.  Play roles.  Sports Jimmy.  I love sports Jimmy.  Come on, I agree.  Fucking exactly, man.  I don't disagree.  I agree, but I don't disagree.  But if you want to look at Wade and Bosch and James, you want to go back to Kareem and Magic?  We'll talk about that.  Kobe Bryant.  Kobe, exactly. 
[03:03:00]  Role player, no.  Is he?  What's up to you?  I don't know.  You tell me.  Shaquille left.  They both seemed to do okay, didn't they?  I mean, Kobe wanted to be number two.  Shaquille wanted to be number one.  But then Kobe was number one.  That's exactly the same situation, except with totally different people you have in Miami right now.  Totally different people.  Same situation.  How about spring training?  Exactly.  That's what I'm trying to say.  You have to have it.  But that's how injuries occur.  People get hurt in spring training and they wonder, how come this guy's not throwing the ball like he used to throw it?  Well, it's because you've got to throw in too many in the spring training.  I've said that for years.  Sparky Lyle.  I was about Sparky Lyle. 
[03:03:30]  1978.  I went out for a Bud Light with Sparky Lyle, even though it didn't exist then.  And I said, God, you're going to hurt your elbow in the spring training.  Scoot.  Scoot.  They always call me Scoot.  What do you think of 18 games in the NFL, man?  18 games in the NFL?  Well, you know, if you want to extend the season and have a lot more players get hurt, that's up to you.  But what about the, you know, what about the hockey?  Huh?  18 games.  18 games?  Well, they don't know.  They just, like, laugh.  They just question.  18.  Well, I think 18 games.  Oh, come on.  What do you think?  Then you make an opinion and I jump on it. 
[03:04:00]  Fuck, Jimmy.  That's perfect.  That is super perfect.  Yeah.  Jimmy's new CD, Despicable, is out today.  Get Despicable.  If you want to see material that you might have heard, fine.  I mean, that's what's on it.  Average material at best.  A little iTunes action on this?  Yeah.  I'm actually very happy with it.  What if people want a hard copy?  Then they can go to San Francisco and see me at Cobbs.  I'm the king of two plugs.  I'll be there Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  Wade, Bosh, and fucking James.  Jim Norton, Despicable, Cobbs.  Do they put CDs in stores at this point?  Yeah, they are in stores.  What stores? 
[03:04:30]  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I don't know either.  I don't know where you get fucking CDs.  I don't even know where you would get CDs.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But Despicable still has CDs.  But sort of.  It's a mess.  It's going away.  They don't take care of it.  You know what I mean?  It's like a holdover.  But there's a lot of space in fucking Best Buy, though.  It takes up the entire middle of the store.  Yeah, they do have a lot of room in those Best Buy.  And the computers are way over there.  And the fucking TVs.  And there's a guy going, you Best Buy.  Oh, God, no.  Now you can get dishwashers at Best Buy.  What's that about?  You can't. 
[03:05:00]  That's fucking human training, though.  That's not good.  Who needs that?  I'm tired.  Me and Florentine sat on the plane.  And we literally talked about farts for an hour and a half.  And we just laughed.  We were literally just telling fart stories on planes and giggling.  And I fucking.  He dozed off.  And I cupped one in my hand.  And I opened it in his face.  And he woke up.  And he was so happy.  And then he just took his headphones off.  And we talked about farts for 10 more minutes. 
[03:05:30]  Fucking.  That's perfect.  I was just laughing.  Because I'm like, I'm a 42-year-old man.  Just laughing about farts.  This is why chick.  You know, me and my girlfriend were arguing.  And I fucking pulled Patrice out as an example.  And I'm like.  And Patrice even says this act.  Whenever you're hanging out with your friends.  Do you wish your chick was there?  No, you don't.  How you say you don't wish your girlfriend was there?  I used that against my girlfriend in a real argument.  You never sit there and go.  You know what would make this better?  Because we're having a good time.  But you know what would kick it up way, way above notches?  My girl.  She's hilarious. 
[03:06:00]  She farts for no reason.  That doesn't fit.  Never.  You never said that?  Miserable.  They really are the worst.  Miserable.  Miserable.  Your CD info is on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  So I think.  You didn't show Patrice by cover.  Through Amazon.  Through Amazon you could get it.  That's me in high school as a sophomore.  So.  Jesus, James.  Wait, number four.  What's going on?  Moving up the charts?  Out of five.  Yeah, I'm behind Glee.  I'll never pass them.  Glee and Glee and Glee.  I'm number four.  I'm going to stay number four.  You're beating out one of the Glees. 
[03:06:30]  That's scary because Glee is behind me.  They got four out of five of the spots.  Yeah, of course.  Why is that on comedy?  Who's that chick next to you?  And who's the black guy next to you?  Don't know.  They were just from a yearbook.  You don't know those guys?  No, who knows them?  I don't remember them.  That shouldn't be in comedy.  What about that high school shooting film?  Do you like the hairdo?  You're just a douche.  I was a young, virile lesbian.  When did you get your first pussy?  18.  In high school?  Yeah, right.  I was a senior.  No.  I didn't pay.  I was like 22. 
[03:07:00]  That girl was horrid looking.  She's gay now.  Really?  She was cute, but she turned gay.  Wait, did we have sex?  No.  I'm incorrect.  That was my first girlfriend.  We didn't have sex, actually.  Wow.  Totally wrong.  The girl I just had sex with the first time just fucking emailed me two days ago.  Can we get her on the phone?  Her name's Michelle.  We might be able to get her in.  She lives in Saudi Arabia now, but she's coming back.  She's like, hey, I'd like to get together.  We had dinner last time.  She was in New York.  We gotta get her on the phone.  We should do old girlfriend day.  You can have her in.  She's fucking...  Way back, though.  Way, way back.  Way.  Yeah, way back shit. 
[03:07:30]  I told her we'd love to talk to her on air.  How dare you?  She was my first sexual experience.  Hey, really fast, too.  I want to thank break.com.  I told them I'd give them a plug today.  They put one of our videos on their front page yesterday, which is fucking cool.  The fart mask video.  Oh.  Starring you, Jim Norton.  Oh, yay.  They put that up on the front page, which is definitely...  It helps.  Oh, my God.  Does it help?  That's funny.  What were you just looking at, man?  Huh?  That's funny as fuck.  The fart mask?  Yeah.  No, he was just looking at his phone.  All right.  I guess we're done.  I don't know. 
[03:08:00]  Well, hey, guys.  Thanks again for letting me come in.  I'll see you guys, what?  A few months?  A couple, six months?  No.  No.  Just let me know.  I'll just...  Why would you wait so long?  I'll give you guys a chance.  Why?  What's the matter?  This whole place is getting weird.  Wait a minute.  I'll see you in a few.  Can we ask you a question?  Yeah.  Are people who are not members of this show...  Yes.  Attempting to make creative...  To bring an outside party.  Attempting to make on-air decisions? 
[03:08:30]  Like, as far as what we determine is funny?  And appropriate?  I think what they're trying to do is make suggestions.  Okay, good.  Only suggestions.  Fair enough.  That are binding.  I have no idea.  Hey, I miss you guys.  No!  I miss you guys.  Do they...  Look, we exaggerate everything.  Stop.  Everything's fine.  Yeah.  Everything's fine.  No.  Because they have to realize that...  Everything's fine.  ...they're not our audience.  Exactly.  They're not our audience. 
[03:09:00]  They don't understand our audience.  Everything's just fine.  We don't want to make...  We're going to miss you.  Miss you guys, man.  No, it's fine.  I have fun every time I come in.  I know.  It's been a pleasure.  I do too.  It's going to be...  I'm just sorry you're the wrong color.  I was surprised when Blatter said that, too.  And for the memo to come out publicly like that...  Yeah.  And say there's just been too many...  And they put, like, you know what's in quotes.  But we knew what it meant.  We know.  In the Opie and Anthony studio, we were like, what the fuck?  I'll, uh...  Thanks, guys.  Something about moral...  Daddy? 
[03:09:30]  Something about moral turpitude.  I miss Dan, Dan.  Where did you just read moral turpitude?  Is that an official letter?  Yeah, that's an official letter.  Moral turpitude.  That's what they got Charlie on.  Oh, you weren't here for that?  Oh, no, you were...  Yeah, you came...  I was practicing some...  They got him on moral turpitude.  I don't even know what that is.  Something about a felony while working for the company or something.  All kind of legal mumbo-jumbo, too.  Why don't they just fucking say you're fired?  It'd be screwed many times if it wasn't for my friend Patrice.  Yeah, I see you guys.  It's moral turpitude. 
[03:10:00]  It's a real issue.  Caroline's Patrice O'Neal.  Thursday through Sunday.  212-757-4100.  And, of course, big mama prods on Twitter.  You guys did what you could for me.  And with that, we'll see you tomorrow.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony Show.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  Cool it was.  There may have been some hoodwinking going on.  Yeah.  But, probably, we're going to investigate that to find out exactly what it is. 
[03:10:30]  Maybe we'll be able to tackle that tomorrow because, obviously, it happened five minutes ago.  We weren't able to figure out exactly what that was.  And, as we just learned from Travis, nobody's really talking about whatever it was.  So, hopefully, and nobody tells me because they know that I just start opening my mouth about things.  You're the last one to know about things.  Because I just tell everybody.  Exactly.  But, it was, today was a bit of a special show.  We mentioned, not really special.  That's a little morbid.  But, we mentioned, yeah, we mentioned in the second hour, I think, that Mike DiStefano, who was a good friend of the show, a very funny comedian, passed away yesterday, we found out, after the show went off the air. 
[03:11:00]  And, we were just talking about some of the stuff he had done on the show.  He hasn't been on in a little while, but his career had absolutely been taking off as of late.  He had just been on Last Comic Standing, he was just putting out a one-man show, and he died of a heart attack, unexpected to everybody. 
[03:11:30]  And, it was a shame, because he was a good guy.  But, Opie was twittering something last night.  He had a link that he wanted us to play.  In fact, I just ran into him as he was leaving, and this is what Opie had to say.  Hey, Sam, I see you're wandering the halls.  And, I know you're getting ready for that 10 o'clock hour.  Yeah.  And, well, we're all thinking of Mike DiStefano today, a great comic, a great guy, a genuine guy, really, really nice guy.  Always appreciative, everything we did for him on our show. 
[03:12:00]  And, it's just really sad that he died at the age of 44 of a heart attack.  And, someone last night tweeted me a video on YouTube called Franny's Last Ride.  And, I think this says a lot about Mike DiStefano.  Not a lot of laughs in this thing, but it certainly tells you what kind of guy he was.  And, I think you should play that today.  Alright.  Well, you know, it's Opie's channel, it's Opie's show, and he's right.  This does display what kind of guy Mike DiStefano is.  It's Franny's Last Ride. 
[03:12:30]  He performed it, I think, at the Aspen Comedy Festival.  And, we'll be back with more after Opie and Anthony live after this.  When I was a kid, I wanted to get a Harley.  Really bad.  I was about seven.  And, I saw these guys riding.  I was in my dad's car in the back, and these dudes were driving by in his Harleys.  And, I remember looking at them and saying, I want to do that, man.  You know?  I want to be free like those guys.  And, you know, I started doing heroin a few years later. 
[03:13:00]  So, I couldn't really get a bike.  I couldn't, you know, I couldn't get toothpaste and shit.  You know, let alone a $15,000 motorcycle.  When I was 18, my parents found me in the house, overdosed, almost dead.  And, they took me to a hospital, and then they took me to a detox, and then to a rehab.  When I was in the rehab, I met Fran. 
[03:13:30]  She was a beautiful, beautiful girl.  The first time I saw her, I was just like, wow, amazed.  And, we started becoming really close, and we went through the rehab.  She had been there a long time before me, and she was finishing up, and I was just starting out.  And, she finished the rehab, and I was still in there.  And, then I finished.  And, we started dating.  And, life was pretty good, you know. 
[03:14:00]  It was hard to get off of heroin, but I was able to do it.  And, I went to college.  I started in college, and Franny and I were together and dating, and I'm just having a good time.  And, one day, she had a really bad fever.  I took her to the hospital, and, 12 hours later, they said that she had this pneumocystic pneumonia.  I don't know what it was, and they said it was from AIDS. 
[03:14:30]  And, I don't know what to do.  I loved her.  And, I wanted to be with her.  New York got her sick a lot.  She coughed a lot, and had bronchitis all the time.  So, we moved to Florida, like when old people moved down there.  We went down to retire.  I figured that we would live as much as we could, and do everything we could. 
[03:15:00]  And, for some reason, I just wanted to make her life the greatest life.  And, we got married, and we were living in Florida.  And, I thought the warm air down there would help her heal and feel better.  But, it didn't.  And, she went into the hospital one night, and the next morning, the doctor told me that she had pneumonia again. 
[03:15:30]  And, that they couldn't really cure it.  And, that she might have a few weeks to live.  And, that was the first time I was told that.  And, I was devastated.  And, she was devastated.  And, they put her in a hospice.  And, like, two weeks later, they sent her out of the hospice, because she started to get better. 
[03:16:00]  She was, like, thrown out of hospice for not dying.  And, only she could pull that off.  She was a young Italian girl, and she was not interested in suffering and dying.  Like, who is?  But, she was extra, not fucking into it.  And, a few weeks later, she got sick again.  I took her back to the hospital.  They put her in.  Doctor told me the same thing.  She's going to, a few weeks, and she's going to be gone. 
[03:16:30]  So, they put her back in hospice.  A month and a half later, they sent her home again.  And, you know, our families, my parents, her parents were happy about it.  Oh, she's going to be better.  But, I knew how to start, you know, I know how the story's going to end.  And, a few weeks later, she ends up back in the hospital.  And, on a Thursday of that week, I was, my motorcycle, my Harley Davidson, was ready to be picked up. 
[03:17:00]  You know?  So, I went that Thursday to get the bike, and it was beautiful.  She was in the hospital.  And, I got a call that she went back to hospice.  So, the day I got the bike, she was back in hospice.  So, I drove the bike over to the hospice, and I didn't know what to do, you know. 
[03:17:30]  Do I even, should I show her the bike?  What the fuck do you do?  So, I went in.  I brought the bike out front, and I went into the room, and I said,  Franny, I want to show you something.  And, I brought her outside and showed her the bike.  And, she was mad, you know.  She's like, what the fuck is that?  I brought it to her because it was our dream together, and she was still very important to me. 
[03:18:00]  And, I just thought that would make her happy, but it didn't.  So, the social worker came over to me and said,  Mike, you know, people are never dying.  They live, and then they die.  And, dying is in a moment.  And, she feels that you're treating her as if she's dying, and you don't need her anymore. 
[03:18:30]  And, you don't love her anymore.  And, you know, that wasn't the truth, you know.  And, I didn't know how to tell her it.  I told her every day.  We used to go out for dinners and stuff.  She wanted to go out.  I would take her out.  She'd have her oxygen tank with her, and I'd take her to a restaurant.  And, I'd look around, and there'd be, I'd see another couple with the husband and taking care of the wife.  But, they were 80.  You know, we were 20.  And, so I went home, and I didn't know what to do. 
[03:19:00]  And, I came back to the hospice, and I brought a few of my work shirts with me  because, like, she loved ironing for me.  She was here, and now she'd fucking yell.  So, I came back a couple hours later, and my shirts were all ironed,  and she was walking around the hospice, dusting, like she would clean the place up.  She was on a lot of morphine, and that, some of you that never did it, it's wonderful. 
[03:19:30]  And, it makes you feel excited about things.  And, so, and then she saw me, and she's like, where's the bike?  And, like, everything I wanted her to feel in the beginning, she felt.  Because, I asked her to iron my clothes.  And, I said, it's outside.  Let's go see, you know.  And, I took her out, and she said, let me sit on it. 
[03:20:00]  So, I put her on it.  And, then she said, can you start it up?  And, she's still alive, so she's still a woman, and this is not enough.  I want that.  So, so, I start the bike up, and it's rumbling, you know.  It was a loud bike.  It was gorgeous.  And, then she's, well, just, can you just take me for a little ride, like, just around the parking lot here?  And, I'm like, fuck, you know, fuck. 
[03:20:30]  Like, you know, I think she's going to fall off the back, you know.  And, I have to tell her family, you know, yeah, she almost died of AIDS.  But, then I killed her on my bike.  I promised her that, like, that the rest of my life would be, first of all, I was going to live for her.  Like, I mean, really live. 
[03:21:00]  And, I would always talk about her.  I don't want to be here telling this story.  I promised her I would.  But, so, now we're riding around the hospice, you know, and she's got the morphine pole next to her.  You know, we're junkies, you know.  We were junkies.  We were different.  We were fucking freaks.  We were people.  People crossed the street when they saw me, you know, and her.  She was a prostitute. 
[03:21:30]  She was a fucking drug addict.  I mean, all the shit that, you know, you know what I'm talking about, some of you.  I couldn't tell.  So, this was amazing, you know.  So, we're riding around this hospice with this morphine pole fucking changeling.  And, all the staff come out and they're watching us, like, you know, and they're cheering us on.  So, all these gay dudes and people that cared about people dying, you know.  So, yeah, none of my friends were there, you know, Frankie and Vinny. 
[03:22:00]  They didn't show up.  So, they're all, like, you know.  And then I hear the pole fall.  And I literally think she fell off the back.  You know, she unhooked the morphine bag.  Which means I want to go out on the street a little bit.  So, I take her out on the street a little bit.  And then she just put her arm around my belly and started rubbing it.  And she said, can we go on the highway? 
[03:22:30]  And I thought of all that we've been through and all the suffering.  And I said, yeah, we could do that.  So, I was on.  We got on I-95 and landed up to 80.  She was just screaming.  Happiness.  Morphine bag was fun. 
[03:23:00]  And for 10 minutes, you know, that wind, like, I always imagined the wind on a bike making you feel free, you know.  It's so powerful.  For 10 minutes, we were normal.  And that wind just blew all the death off of us.  Here I am in Aspen. 
[03:23:30]  I want to be, you know, I want a special and HBOs and money, but nothing I'll ever do will be that grand.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're back with After Opie and Anthony Live.  That was Mike DiStefano.  Like we said, if you're just tuning in, we're keeping the channel live after Opie and Anthony leave. 
[03:24:00]  Because they leave at, you know, 10 o'clock.  As soon as they say goodbye to you, they say goodbye to us and they're out the door.  But, uh, that was Mike DiStefano, a friend of the show, a great comedian who passed away yesterday.  And, yeah, I know that that wasn't the funniest bit of all time, but, uh, the man passed away.  Uh, his, that is a story about his wife, I believe, uh, that was Franny's last ride.  And you should really look it up on YouTube so you can watch him telling this story because it really is great.  It's called Franny's last ride. 
[03:24:30]  I, I just thought that maybe we could get human for a second.  Uh, but, Troy Kwan is in here who works for the story.  Troy Kwan.  No, I just want to laugh.  Put on something funny, dude.  That's what you came in here for?  Yes, please.  All right, well, I guess that's what's going on.  What are you working on?  Ah, just finishing up the show and getting ready to, uh, do a couple other things.  That's right, folks.  A whole lot of nothing.  That's what that means.  No, Jim Norton's show over in the Boneyard.  Sirius 19 XM 53, son.  Very good.  Troy, we'll make you laugh because Mike DiStefano, as we said, was hilarious. 
[03:25:00]  He was a great comedian and a great friend.  And this was, uh, when he came on the Opie and Anthony show, as a matter of fact.  We'll play a little of that.  I'm still trying to get to the bottom.  Maybe, Troy, do you know, at the end of the show today, they started very much talking in code.  Patrice started talking about it being his last show with Opie and Anthony.  Do you have any idea what they were talking about?  It just seems like there was drama going on outside there the whole time today.  Because they don't tell me things because I talk about it to everybody.  I bring it up on the air.  I don't have a filter at all. 
[03:25:30]  I just tell everyone.  Yeah, I don't know.  You know, you might want to talk to Roland.  I think he may know what's going on, but I don't know.  I talked to him yesterday on this show, and all he said was jizzies.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  E-Rock, you always are in the know.  Do you know what's going on with all the code that they were talking in after the show?  Nope.  I think I have been out of the loop on a lot of things and just not taking that initiative  anymore to find out what exactly is really going on behind the scenes.  Not taking that initiative anymore?  Oh, even more so.  Okay.  Well, Ron and Fez are starting to set up the studio now.  So we're going to play a little bit more for Mike DiStefano. 
[03:26:00]  This was when he was on the O&A show.  He was talking about dealing with the comedy clubs in New York, specifically Laugh Factory.  This is Mike DiStefano, a friend who passed away yesterday on the O.P. and Anthony show.  I'm not in a good space this week.  Why?  What happened?  No, just because in comedy, as a stand-up, that's all I really fucking know about.  Drugs, stand-up, and little bits of crime in my life.  That's my whole life story. 
[03:26:30]  Little bits of crime.  And this week, there's a club.  I'm not going to get into who, what, and where, but there's this big, fat, Jewish-American  gentleman that just took over a club in Times Square.  He took over a club, and this guy's a fucking filth bag.  He is a scumbag, and I've been there for three years.  I kill in this place.  I'm kind of blue.  You know, I do my thing, but I kill.  I do what I got to do.  And this guy comes in.  Within a week, he has me fucking taking off the scale.  I can't, you can't play early shows, the booker told me. 
[03:27:00]  Why are they getting PC and comedy clubs?  In a club.  That should be the last place.  Which club is douching you?  You might as well.  It was the Laugh Factory.  And the Laugh Factory hasn't really been douching.  They've been pretty cool with me, because you know what it is?  It's a whole, it's a fucking porn joint, first of all.  The guy that owns it, it's a porn guy.  He opened a comedy club with Jamie Masada from fucking L.A.  You know, don't say N-word.  It's on a ban.  Yeah, we know.  I said it 50 times the night he banned it. 
[03:27:30]  I still stayed there.  Fuck it.  Well, what happens is...  Banning the N-word from a comedy club.  That's completely insane.  I mean, Jamie brought up a point, you know, about the gangs and stuff in L.A., but I'm  just...  I don't know.  I didn't mind him banning it.  No, you said the funniest thing about not letting black people in the club anymore.  That was fucking classic.  That's the funniest thing said about...  Norton said it on your show.  When Jamie was here, Jamie was going, buddy, I don't want to have big problems in L.A.  We have the riots and blah, blah, blah. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, so we banned the N-word.  And Jimmy said, real quiet, you know, he said, he goes, instead of banning the N-word,  why don't you just stop letting black people into the club?  And to me...  Yeah, it was just funny.  I understood it because of the gang threats he was getting.  It's almost like they were threatening to firebomb his club.  Right.  He's in a really weird position.  Yeah.  So he was partners in this club.  He left.  Wait, Jamie's not part of that club anymore?  No, no.  He's not part of the club.  Yeah, yeah, it's a real whatever. 
[03:28:30]  But all the staff there, the one thing about them, they really didn't, they don't know  about stand-up, which was actually good because all they did was go, wow, this guy makes  everyone laugh.  We like him.  They didn't fucking, what is he saying?  Yeah.  Everyone's laughing.  And comedy, that's what it is.  I saw you.  You were hilarious.  I didn't feel like you were like over the top dirty, were you?  Well, this guy, no, no, this guy that...  I mean, you're definitely edgy, but...  There was this guy that came in now.  He took over.  It was going to be called the Mad Comedy Club. 
[03:29:00]  See, Times Square, you don't have to...  Times Square, you can sell anything.  There's so many people there.  Yeah.  And they're not repeat customers.  So who cares if they see a shit show or not?  They don't give a fuck.  So this guy comes in, and within two days, my schedule got all fucked up.  I'm on two o'clock in the morning, one day.  So I called the booker.  I said, why do you have me on so late, man?  I don't play that late.  He said, well, you know, Mike, I'm trying...  I said, what the fuck happened?  He said, well, Marty, this guy, Marty, this fucking old creep, who hates my guy. 
[03:29:30]  He just don't like me.  Anyway...  Is he a guy from New York Comedy?  Yeah, you know.  He sits in the back and fucking jerks.  So I don't know what he does.  Right?  Look at the face.  That's what the guy is.  A fucking animal.  And I promised I...  No, no, hey, Opie, I said, I'm not going to bring the guy's name up, because I don't  want to, you know...  I'm just curious.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to finish.  You got me going.  We have a lot of power on this show.  We've turned a lot of people on to new comics and great comedy clubs.  And I'll be honest, I've never been to the Laugh Factory in Times Square. 
[03:30:00]  I never had the urge to go there for whatever reason.  Right.  Well, because it seems like, you know, I've been to comics.  I've been to the Cellar.  I've been to Dangerfield, which is just a fucking funeral.  Dangerfield, yeah.  It's a coffin.  Stan of New York is wonderful.  The Cellar, Caroline's, you know...  Well, I...  The thing...  All right, so the guy, the booker, he said to me, well, Marty said you can only play late  shows because you're too dirty for him.  So I said, fine.  I go, tell Marty to go fuck his mother. 
[03:30:30]  I swear...  And he go...  I go, are you writing this down?  Write this down.  I want it word for word.  You tell him to go fuck his mother.  This guy would let people fuck his dead sister.  If they paid for two drinks.  The two drink minimum, you could watch my dead sister get hammered in the air.  Like, that's the kind of fucking filth he is.  Now, and so...  So I told the kid that.  Now, this is like...  Now, I fully understand, by the way, why I don't see you on TV. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  Because I saw your Dennis Leary friends, I'm like, this motherfucker's hilarious.  Why haven't I seen him around?  I'll get there.  Eric, you might have a little bit of a problem.  Anger?  Anger issue?  No, I don't really.  Like, like...  Fuck your mother.  I mean...  Because...  Because...  A dead sister.  No, but Opie, you got to understand, man.  Mike, I'm with you, actually.  This is all I got left, man.  I got no fucking...  I got nothing else.  Yeah.  You know, you...  I'm sure...  Hey, I don't know how it felt to get taken off the air, to be fucked with.  Oh, it was great.  It was awesome.  Well, no, when you were by yourself, there had to be a bad feeling inside. 
[03:31:30]  Like, fuck!  Of course.  Not really.  You're fucking with my...  No, not really.  We had to make believe, you know, that we wanted people to feel sorry for us.  But actually, you know...  You're full of shit, man.  It was kind of cool.  I mean, the millions were rolling in, they still had to pay off.  No, no, see, now forget the money.  I got to go wherever the fuck I wanted for two years.  The money's one thing.  I'm losing $25 a spot when I get thrown out of a club.  You know what I mean?  No, I'm actually...  The money's got to hurt, but...  I'm actually with you.  When people fuck with your livelihood, it's...  Yeah, of course.  You guys, I don't know you well.  Here's what I think about you.  You guys are fucking millionaires, and you dress like fucking animals. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  So, you know, you're down to earth...  Scum.  ...and creative.  Yeah, you know.  Look at Jimmy.  Jimmy's got a great career.  Look at him.  He just fucking wears sneakers and hangs out.  He's not trying to...  I explained that yesterday.  I don't feel like I deserve good things, so that's why I continue to dress like I'm...  All right, well, guess what?  You just like me then.  Like I make $15,000 a year.  Then you like fucking me and the rest of us.  Right.  Now, so can I finish with this story, or do you want me to shut up?  Oh, sure.  I want to hear it.  No, Anthony, come on.  Yeah.  I want to hear it.  Anthony, I like this. 
[03:32:30]  I guess the 20 people's still listening to the show, I guess...  No, I like this shit.  You could try to get them to turn to the Zeppelin channel as well.  I want to hear what happened.  After the fucking guy...  This is amazing.  Go ahead.  Go fuck your mother.  That's where we were in the letter.  No, so I said...  So they call me back.  Now, the booker calls me back the next day and tells me,  Mike, everybody went to bat for you.  All the staff argued with him.  And he said, he's going to pay you for the spots he canceled, 
[03:33:00]  because I told him that's one of the deals.  You pay me for every spot you canceled this week, whatever.  So they called me, and it was nice.  I felt good.  I was like, you know what?  Everyone looked down for me.  Fine.  Put me back on the schedule.  The next night, I had a meeting with Dennis Leary's people.  Like, we had a meeting after that show I did.  And I called.  I said, look, I have a really important meeting.  I can't make the spot tonight.  Well, Mike, there's a new policy.  If you cancel a spot, they take you off the whole week.  Oh, shit.  And you had a great reason.  Yeah.  So I said to him, well... 
[03:33:30]  You know, zero tolerance, obviously.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a new zero tolerance policy.  He's going back to the weapons in school.  Zero tolerance.  You know, for uppity comics.  See, this is the difference between what you're saying and hanging out with Jimmy.  The seller, a lot of big names go in there.  Yeah.  But you could easily call up Esty and go, look, Esty, I can't make my spot tonight,  because I'm going to be on Jay Leno, or I'm going to have a meeting with HBO or something.  And like that, she just says, okay.  She don't like when you cancel spots, but you know what?  But she understands that it's part of what you are as a comic, 
[03:34:00]  that you've got other opportunities that you can't blow off.  But go ahead, Mike.  Esty's like, she's a gay...  Fascinating.  Yeah.  Is it really?  Don't break my...  I'm very sensitive.  You guys don't understand that.  People think I'm a tough guy.  I'm a fucking tender guy.  I'm very sensitive.  I'll fucking split your head with a hammer.  No, but after trying to talk to you, I'll try.  So this fuck over...  Why don't we call Marty?  Can we get Marty in the air?  No, he's a scumbag.  He don't even have a phone, probably.  He's an animal, right? 
[03:34:30]  So he got...  But he's out of there.  Here's what happened.  They called me yesterday.  And I said to the kid, I saw his number.  I said, what's up, BJ?  I said, why are you calling me, bro?  I told you not to call me unless Marty Fisher was dead.  It's the only way I want to hear from you.  And he said, Mike, he's out.  They threw him out.  He's already starting to fucking embezzle shit and fuck with the money.  So they fired him.  Well, that's what Mike's saying.  I have no idea.  And I'm back there.  Sitting back there.  Yeah.  So that story wasn't worth telling.  All's good with you.  Not really. 
[03:35:00]  There's a lot of drama in there.  There was a lot of drama.  Yeah.  I like any comedian motherfucking club owners and stuff like that.  Hell yeah.  Because most of us don't do it.  So I enjoy that.  Well, you probably did it years ago.  I mean, not...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, now...  Jim used to do it with his act.  You can't have any self-worth as a comic until you're making enough money.  Right.  And I just don't...  I'm not going for that.  I can't live like that.  You know?  I can't.  Not that I'm... 
[03:35:30]  I don't go around arguing with nobody.  But this guy...  You know, certain things you can't...  You don't fucking tell...  You don't start taking me off the schedule after three years of killing in that fucking place.  So now you're back to doing your thing.  Well, yeah.  Now I'm back over there.  Yeah.  Whenever I want.  You know?  So...  I'm treated good over there.  So that was Mike DiStefano.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Robertson.  You know, like we said, you guys know by now that Opie and Anthony are long gone at this point.  I mean, Anthony's already back in Long Island.  But we're all still here.  You rock me, Danny, Travis, Troy, D-Boy. 
[03:36:00]  And we're keeping the channel alive.  Mike DiStefano proving...  You know, all great comedians have one thing in common.  And that's that they're brutally honest.  And don't mind airing some dirty laundry out in front of anybody  who wants to listen.  And that was definitely Mike DiStefano.  He passed away just yesterday.  He was a good friend of the show, a comedian.  You know, since we've moved here...  We moved here a couple years ago.  We used to be on 57th Street in a studio all by ourselves. 
[03:36:30]  But since we've been in the SiriusXM compound building where all the studios are together,  we've learned to kind of be able to observe what's going on with other channels.  And this place is in a panic today.  We've got reporters, publicists, bookers, producers all running around like chickens with their heads off.  Because apparently Avril Lavigne is here today.  Yeah, she is.  I mean, I don't know. First of all, E-Rock, do you know why we didn't get her on the Opie and Anthony show?  Because we don't play her music. 
[03:37:00]  Was it also an issue of what we do play? For instance, Opie and Anthony?  Yeah, that would be it too.  Yeah, but I mean, people go crazy here when a big star like that shows up.  Well, she's a big star.  She's a young girl.  And she's hot looking.  And is that, what is that, the trifecta of disaster?  That's pretty much when every channel from like Shade 45 to the oldies channel and trucking,  they all go out to the lobby to see her come in.  DJ Who Kid is just trying to figure out some way he can finagle his way into an interview. 
[03:37:30]  Ah, he's going to get her.  I hope we do. We're not going to.  I should go try to get a one question with her.  I'm getting a photo.  You are?  Oh yeah.  How are you going to get that one?  Hookup.  Oh yeah, right.  E-Rock's got the hookup.  He just jumps in.  He's just pushy.  Okay, I'll remember that.  Well, can you be pushy for me too then, I guess?  I usually am, but if you're going to take it that way, then fuck you.  Well, sorry about that.  We should play a little more Mike DiStefano.  As he said in that clip, he tries to be a sensitive guy.  He's a nice guy. 
[03:38:00]  Or he was.  He was a very warm-hearted guy.  But, you know, everybody has to get physical from time to time.  This is Mike DiStefano talking about the last time he punched somebody here  on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Well, he didn't punch them here on this show, but he's talking.  Well, we're playing the clip.  You get it.  Yeah.  When was the last time you hit somebody?  It's been a while, like a couple of months.  Like a couple of months.  That hot thing, that was the last time, the thing at the comedy club with a guy.  But honestly, the guy was swinging right at my face. 
[03:38:30]  I got him before he got me.  I was guilty of being quicker than him.  That was it.  There was no...  I'm with you with the anger thing.  I'd slam some guy's, you know, leg with the cab door only Friday.  So I'm with you, bro.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  And I know how stupid it is, but you got to do what you got to do sometimes.  Well, because we don't...  You know, we're men, and we don't know how to fucking, you know, deal with feelings.  Right, right.  If you get embarrassed...  If you embarrass me, I could kill you. 
[03:39:00]  Like, that's how bad...  No, no, I'm not saying you.  I'm just saying, like, that's my trigger.  Someone fucking embarrasses me.  Like, a lot of guys, a lot of comics do this shit.  Talking like you were saying, I stay away from it.  Not that I'm tough or none of it.  I know myself.  One of these guys turn around and say something like, cute.  I don't know how to take that.  Like, you know, we're not that close.  Like, if we're really close, then it's all bets are off.  But some of them just...  You know, there was another...  I ain't going to say comics names, because that I won't do.  But this one comic, I was going to fucking kill him in 15 seconds. 
[03:39:30]  I know.  He can't help it.  He just gets riled out.  I know.  It's like, oh, this comedy club owner.  Ah, I'm not going to go there.  I'm not going to say his name.  So Marty, the fucking animal that he is...  He's not really a club owner.  No, they just run in their fucking mouth.  It actually went on the radio.  When I got passed at the cellar, this fucking piece of shit was on, like, over at X, the  other radio, the other serious thing.  He was on the Brewer show, and he was saying, the motherfucker, my D. Tofano, got passed 
[03:40:00]  at the motherfucking cellar.  That shit is bullshit.  Really?  Yeah, he was a colored fella, if you can hear the accent.  Yeah, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  It was really...  A colored fella.  Well-veiled fella.  Someone called me and told me, oh, this guy's saying this shit.  So I just went up to him and said, did you say something about me on the radio?  He's like, yeah, man.  I said, look, I see you bullying a lot of people, but, like, I will fuck, because he  has a fucked up arm, the dude.  Oh, that's what I thought you meant.  So, yeah.  Yeah, so, no, he has a bad...  No, no, I'm not going to... 
[03:40:30]  Write the name, because I want it on you.  I said, I'll fucking tie my arm behind my back, and I'll fucking punch you to death the  next time you fucking...  And he started bitching like a little girl.  Oh, shit.  Like a little fucking girl.  But that was it.  I thought you were taking on a real black guy.  Jesus.  No, a white guy acting black.  A wigger.  Well, no, why would he...  He's an actual black wigger.  Why would he...  A bull wigger.  Why would he fucking...  Me.  Motherfuck you.  Why the fuck? 
[03:41:00]  I don't know.  Maybe jealous.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  I was impressed.  I thought you were taking on a real black guy, man.  No, I wasn't taking on anybody.  That's not the point.  You were taking on the handicapped.  That's not...  I know, but sometimes...  Look, if a guy with liver disease fucking spits in your face, you kick him in the fucking  stomach.  You know what I mean?  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  Wise words.  Wise words.  Fez was just in here.  They're getting ready for the Ron and Fez show.  He looks to be doing well.  If you've ever wondered what it's like to be associated with Jim Norton on a business 
[03:41:30]  level, I was just looking at Norton's Twitter, and Jim tweeted, I think, last night, I just  left a putrid fart in my manager's new car and then texted him.  Now, for most of us, that would be evidence enough, just a recounting of the tale, but Jim  decided to tweet a picture of this text, asking his manager if he got any.  His manager replied, disgusting.  Norton asked, is it bad? 
[03:42:00]  And his manager wrote, yes.  No more new car smell.  So, if you've ever wanted to get that new car smell out of your car, maybe give Norton  a ride somewhere.  Twitter is twitter.com slash Jim Norton, and you could be entertained by that.  I mean, it's more entertaining if you read it to yourself, because you could read it  to yourself in Jim's voice.  You don't have to hear my voice do it.  But, we're going to continue with some more Mike DiStefano, because he was a great friend  of the show.  He passed away yesterday. 
[03:42:30]  We heard him doing Franny's last ride at the beginning of After Opie and Anthony Live,  and I believe, I don't think he said during that, I guess you'd call it a bit, but it was  more like a story.  He said, I don't know if he said in his story that that was his wife, I'm assuming it was  his wife.  He spoke briefly about the death of his wife when he was on ONA, and believe it or not,  Opie and Anthony weren't quite as sensitive as the audience that Mike DiStefano told his  story to originally in Aspen. 
[03:43:00]  Here's Mike on the Opie and Anthony show, telling them that his wife had passed away some years  ago.  Are you married?  No.  No, my wife died.  What?  You ask questions, I'm going to answer them, and the show can go off in a whole other  direction.  I don't care.  Not everything has to be funny in the show.  I don't know if I ever told you that.  I was married, my wife, we were clean, we got off drugs, and she got sick with hepatitis,  and she died. 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeez, Mike.  Any other questions?  Wow.  Boy, you really want people to come to your comedy show, huh?  Dude, no.  Wow, the laughs will ensue.  This is what I do, man.  Sorry, but...  No, it was a long time.  I mean, it's, you know, it's like 12 years now. 
[03:44:00]  It's been a while.  She died 12 years ago?  Yeah.  How long were you married?  Six years.  Yeah, yeah, she was my girl.  Did you know she was going to die, or was it?  Yeah, I knew she got sick after a couple years.  I knew she was ill, and I stuck out.  And they couldn't turn this around?  Nah, nah.  Once you have shed all kinds of shit, forget it.  She ended up with a lot of lung damage and shit from pneumonias.  It was horrible.  But, no, dude, you know, listen.  This is what makes me who I am.  This is why I'm the way I am.  And this is what makes me a good comic, you know, at least. 
[03:44:30]  A good comic, you know, or somebody that the people know they're listening to something.  They're not just fucking hearing...  I just got to write notes.  You know, jokes that are from somewhere else.  You know, it's coming from inside, like, you know, the pain.  Well, that was Mike DiStefano.  At least he had a positive spin on it.  But there was a little more positive than just playing a laugh track over the announcement.  E-Rock, I know Avril Lavigne is now in this building.  Yes.  So, she wouldn't do Opie and Anthony. 
[03:45:00]  Do you think we could book Avril Lavigne for an appearance on After Opie and Anthony Live?  Like, maybe right now.  I could try.  She's in the LQ studio right behind us.  Is that why you keep leaving the board?  Because you're trying to just look at her?  Oh, yes.  Oh, E-Rock, could you maintain some semblance of professionalism?  You didn't even let me finish.  Don't care.  Semblance of nothing, I suppose.  Well, Mike DiStefano, obviously, as we've talked about throughout the hour, a friend of the show who passed away,  a great comedian, and he obviously was a positive guy in the end, the way he spun, you know, 
[03:45:30]  the horrible thing that happened to his wife into saying it's what made him a good comic.  Like, he went in a little further on that theory and why people in general aren't happy when he was on the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll play that for you.  We will be back with more After Opie and Anthony Live.  This is Mike DiStefano.  Some tragedy in there, huh?  It's not a big deal.  Like, everyone...  Yeah, but so what?  It's kind of a big deal.  It's not.  You know what? 
[03:46:00]  It shouldn't be a big deal.  To lose your wife?  That's a biggie.  That's a biggie for me, but it shouldn't be a big deal to talk about it.  That's why, you know...  Oh, I don't...  I'm not uncomfortable.  No, no, Opie, even in some ways, that's why this country, this shit you were saying before,  how we're all fucking weak, because there's no...  People don't want to look at nothing.  They want to...  These little fucking douche...  You ever see these young kids with that stupid look of hope walking around, like,  ooh, everything's going to work out.  It's not, you little douchebag.  Stupid look of hope.  Yeah, yeah, it's an...  Because it's unreasonable. 
[03:46:30]  It's unreasonable.  There's no hope out there?  There is hope, but it's hope...  But you're going to suffer, you motherfucker.  Yeah.  And the hope is that you get through it.  Not that you avoid it.  I do laugh when I hang out with, like, high school kids, you know, within the family.  Look at these guys.  What the fuck are we doing?  We want to see tits and people farting.  I do laugh when you do talk to kids that are still in high school and they have such dreams  and you're like, you have no fucking idea.  It's not going to happen the way you want. 
[03:47:00]  I had a friend, Joe, in high school and we were graduating high school in our senior year.  He said, this is going to be the best year of our life.  And I didn't understand at the time, but he knew.  He just knew that it just gets so bad after high school for many, many years.  And then maybe some of this hope does turn around for you and you do become successful.  It's something you want to get into or whatever.  But all these high school kids with the dreams of being the heart doctor and being an astronaut  and I'm going to be on the Olympic team.  And God bless you.  I think everyone should have dreams. 
[03:47:30]  I certainly had my own dreams when I was growing up.  But the reality is what you just said, that there's going to be fucking hell in many years  where you don't even know where the fuck you're going in your life, how you're going to pay  your bills.  Another chick breaking your heart.  All this shit.  They have no idea in high school.  It's all just, it's easy.  You know, they bitch about a test or something or writing a paper.  Who gives a shit?  That shit is easy compared to real life.  Here's the pain.  Deal with it.  Then you'll have hope.  Dude, people.  That's my point.  Then you'll have hope.  Not, you don't make it up as you, ooh, it's going to be perfect. 
[03:48:00]  I'm going to, the American dream.  The American dream is fucking, you work hard when you're young and then you spend the rest  of your life protecting your fucking money and then you die alone and your kids are home  managing their portfolios because that's what you taught them to fucking do.  To make money, you know, and it's all, and then some retarded guy with fucking Down  Syndrome is happy every day.  Hello.  Good morning.  It's good to see you.  Yeah, they have no worries.  Yeah, right.  Because they're missing all this shit that makes the rest of us douchebags. 
[03:48:30]  I learned that lesson a while ago.  I don't feel sorry for people like that whatsoever.  No.  Because they have no clue.  They're just happy.  Ignorance.  They're happy in their fucking skin.  They're simple.  Dude, we had a guy that delivered mail at NAW.  I tell this story every once in a while, but it's one of my favorite stories.  And he grew attached to me for whatever reason.  I'm feeling that way, too, though.  I feel that way, too.  Well, Jimmy kind of brought up yesterday, there is a sweetness to me that I don't allow  to come out often.  But he kind of felt that, maybe because they have that retard, like, extra intuition or 
[03:49:00]  an extra sense.  I don't know.  And people around the office, what was that?  Piece of paper.  Why?  I just flicked it.  I meant it to go over there, and it just missed your head.  People around the office are like, you should take him to lunch.  We take turns taking him to lunch so he feels part of the workplace and stuff.  And I'm like, how bad could this be?  I'll take him to lunch.  We'll talk about the Mets.  He's a Mets fan, and we'll make pictures with crayons on the fucking menus or whatever, 
[03:49:30]  right?  So I bring him down to the Brooklyn Diners, just me and him.  And the waitress comes over, and she had big tits.  And the kid, who doesn't look like he's slow, by the way, is just staring at the tits to  the point where I wanted to fucking hide.  Because he doesn't understand.  To him, it's tits, and it's the greatest day of his life.  He's getting a free lunch and looking at tits.  And that's all he knew.  No manipulation.  And all he cared about.  He doesn't give a shit.  He didn't try to manipulate it and hide it. 
[03:50:00]  But the waitress is getting pissed, ready to tell this guy off.  And I'm just like, oh my God.  And I can't tell the waitress that he's a little slow, and that's why he's looking at  your tits.  Hey, he's retarded.  Leave him alone.  But getting back to your point, that's his life.  Yeah.  He's happy.  He's not worried about getting a promotion.  He was happy delivering the mail, all wrong, by the way, to the wrong mailboxes.  But, you know.  Seeing tits for us isn't enough.  We have to tie her up.  Right.  Punch her in the back of the head.  You know, there's all...  We need extra shit.  It's not enough to just look at them and enjoy them. 
[03:50:30]  But, no, it's true.  Like, they're very simple people.  Simple people.  Give chocolate milk's the meaning of life.  Yeah.  He's fucking at, you know.  And Craig from Scranton, PA.  Well, Ope, what about you?  You made it, dude.  So why can't other kids dream, too?  That's the only thing that keeps you going.  I said that we all should have dreams.  Yeah.  But you should...  There's a reality to it, too.  It's not as easy as you think it is when you're 17, 18, 19, 20 years old.  It's not about...  Dude, I've been doing radio since I was 18.  I was only successful seven years ago.  Right.  But you stood with it. 
[03:51:00]  The point is, these kids are walking around thinking it's all going to be great.  Well, the people that know my timeline and radio, I was in Buffalo doing overnights.  And I moved home to Long Island to work at BAB, a place where I started interning.  I moved home from Buffalo with no fucking money in the bank whatsoever.  I couldn't even pay the toll coming back over the bridge to Long Island.  I had to actually open up the back and find my change thing to pay the toll.  I had nothing.  And I was up there already in age. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  And then finally, one thing after another worked out for me.  It's not...  But people will see that, Opie, be disconnected from the reality of how you got to where you are.  And the fact that you still have unhappiness in your fucking life.  You're not perfectly happy.  Right.  Life's not like that.  No.  That's all I'm saying.  Get rid of that fucking horse shit.  Right.  And realize that there's struggles. 
[03:52:00]  You know, you put a fucking iPod on and block it all out.  Look at an iPod.  Yeah.  No one's going to die.  People are still confused on instant feedback.  Yes.  You should have the dreams.  But there's a reality to it as well.  And you should be prepared for the reality and the hard work and a lot of disappointment.  I mean, most people don't make it because they get rejected or whatever.  And they're like, all right, I suck.  Right.  And they quit.  Right.  You know, that's when you should dig in harder and work harder at what you want to do.  Well, their parents are afraid of their own...  Their parents are afraid, so they make them afraid by telling them how perfect they are. 
[03:52:30]  You're special, Penelope.  Penelope, you're special.  You have a wonderful little white vagina.  It smells like lemon and coriander.  It's not dirty.  You're wonderful.  Then she's 25.  Someone lets her down and she goes to the hospital for fucking surgery to repair the fucking dad.  You know what I mean?  This is all I'm saying.  These assholes are going to go, oh, you have to have dreams.  That's not what we're saying, you fucking jackass.  Just be prepared for the reality of it and how hard it really is. 
[03:53:00]  Life is messy, man.  It's hard and messy.  It's not easy.  There's no overnight success stories.  And the game plan doesn't...  You can't make a game plan and then follow it and have it work.  It falls apart somewhere.  You're not in control of it.  You get these obstacles thrown in there.  It's after Open Anthony Live.  That was Mike DiStefano, great friend, comedian, friend of the show.  And like we said, people are panicking about Avril Lavigne being outside. 
[03:53:30]  The funny thing about bookers is I guess it's ingrained in them  because Roland, even though Avril Lavigne has nothing to do with him,  Roland's walking around panicking just because there's someone up here famous.  The great Ron Bennington is now in studio.  Well, I did see Roland out there and he was sweating and he said to me,  this needs to go perfectly.  And I go, she's not your guest.  It has nothing to do with you.  But he said, you don't understand, she's a name.  And there was someone laying on the ground that had their jugular vein cut 
[03:54:00]  and Roland stepped on them to get that Ron Bennington because she needed a muffin.  But it wasn't his guest.  No.  Apparently there's reporters running around here too today, I hear.  Yes, but we're not allowed to say from where, right?  Well, I haven't.  I'm not going to...  I don't even know, let's just say.  Why, you brought it up though.  I'm saying there's reporters.  Hey, I want to take the time though to promote the gig that you and I are doing over at that video place.  I'm really looking forward to it.  Which gig is that?  I don't...  Well, you and I were setting up that video game tournament with the 80s people.  No, that's... 
[03:54:30]  And I think it's going to go really great.  And our Saturday night show is finally going to start being accepted the way it should.  Well, you're probably talking about special delivery starring Sam and Dave.  Right now, Dave, I don't know whether you're staying with it because I've been taught this crossover thing  that you and I have been doing is getting really...  The suits are loving it.  I saw one of the bosses talking to you when you were walking in.  Were they talking about this from...  Yes.  Yes, they were.  That's amazing.  I mean, I thought after Opie and Anthony Live had potential to do something.  I didn't think day two would be, you know, it would catch on that huge.  Well, they still... 
[03:55:00]  They want to get rid of the name special delivery and just call it after Opie and Anthony Live.  Even on Saturday nights?  Even on Saturday nights.  So that should be pretty exciting.  And is this something that E-Rock would still be invited to or...  You know, I noticed yesterday E-Rock didn't even give me a hello.  What?  And I don't know whether because he's like a little busier with this thing, but I always get a nice hello out of E-Rock.  It's also because you were on Live from the Compound, Anthony's web show over the weekend. 
[03:55:30]  I kicked ass.  You did.  I mean, you kind of had to make do with some technical difficulties, but I did catch at one point Anthony said,  Yeah, we'll hook something up.  Just email E-Rock.  And you said, Yeah, I'll email E-Rock.  We're really close.  Well, that hurt my feelings because I have Ant's fucking home number.  You called...  I could call him directly.  I now need to go through his people.  Yeah.  Set it up through my guy.  So, E-Rock, did that hurt your feelings when I got my feelings hurt?  Yes, because I would never not say hello to Mr. Bennington. 
[03:56:00]  Well, no, yesterday you did not say hello to me, but I realized that now you're actually working in between these shows.  Well, I mean, he was supposed to be doing that before.  I want to be treated like Avril Lavigne.  Like 15 people lining up in the hallways and everybody making sure nobody gets any pictures,  but E-Rock trying to figure out a way to get one anyway.  By the way, when you were playing the stuff about Mike,  isn't it crazy how this is blowing up?  I don't know whether you've been following the internet.  Yeah.  But it's so awful that a guy like that doesn't get to see how many people exploded. 
[03:56:30]  One of the booking people here was crying when I walked in.  Gee, and he probably had no idea.  He had no idea whatsoever.  That any of this would happen to everybody.  And now he's like, Yeah, you remember from Last Comic Standing,  whereas before he was just trying to get some kind of recognition,  just something to get by.  If I was Tommy Johnigan right now, I'd be saying,  I'm doing better than I ever thought.  Because no one, you know, these guys, they bust their ass with this.  But I want you to take that tape that you have of those, 
[03:57:00]  because I think people are going to be so much more, you know,  when Mike did the O&A show, I think that's the thing that people are going to go back  and listen to in the future.  And I want to dub my voice in there kind of as a third bite.  Kind of get your own little credit for that.  Like I was in there and all I,  like, just I'll just, you know, let's do a couple of things where I just go,  that's a good one, Mike.  Or, hey, Ant, you and Mike are seeing the same way right now.  Whatever it takes.  Just something you could jump in that, you know.  And then also, I think what would be great is edit out one of his punchlines, 
[03:57:30]  I'll do it.  So that way, and then leave the laugh in.  Right, leave the laugh in.  That way you can get a little.  It just seems like, hey, Ronnie B was right there with him.  So you could get some of that Last Comic Standing glory.  I would love it.  You know.  I would love it.  Did you hear the thing that we started with?  It wasn't exactly a bit.  It was just him telling a story of his wife dying.  And it was just, you should look it up on YouTube when you get home.  It's Franny's Last Ride.  Yeah.  And it's a tearjerker.  I heard that somebody wrote that he had done this on Mark Maron's podcast, too. 
[03:58:00]  He told this story, and people were going back and listening to it last night.  Does it make you, like, as somebody who, you know, you love interviewing.  It's one of your specialties.  Does it make you wish that you had gotten a chance to interview him now that you know?  Actually, I don't know whether, I said this yesterday, he had written to me when he got  on Last Comic Standing and said, I used to listen to you guys on N.E.W. when you were on 
[03:58:30]  after O&A.  You and I have a lot of the same past.  It'd be great.  And then, you know, because I was promoting Tommy John again, who's a buddy of mine at the  time, I'm like, yeah, right, Mike.  Yeah.  See you later.  But this might be great.  Can we go back and edit that, make it Ronnie's Last Ride, where it sounds like Mike's taking  me around on his motorcycle.  Like you just kind of, okay.  Or maybe even we'll grab Mark Maron's podcast, and you could just kind of take out his questions.  Right.  And we'll put it on unmasked.  And then we'll call it a smodcast, or one of my new things is Roncast. 
[03:59:00]  Roncast?  I'm just starting to edit myself into everything.  This is great.  That way you don't even have to think of new stuff.  E-Rock, if Admiral Levine walks by, just give us the, you know, the hi-hat.  I'll just bring her right in.  That'd be great.  Well, then, shall I have to do Ron and Fez, because this is it for After Opie and Anthony  Live?  We had, hey, it was great.  Yeah.  Hey, stay tuned to these guys after.  I think they're going to have a hell of a show today.  Gwyneth Paltrow's stopping by.  Wow.  From Glee?  Katy Perry.  Kenny Rogers. 
[03:59:30]  Incredible.  The Bachelor is coming in about his big choice.  You're just reading entertainment headlines.  Yes, I am.  Okay.  Ron and Fez.  And then it's Fat Tuesday.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Thank you for listening to After Opie and Anthony Live.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. </pre>
