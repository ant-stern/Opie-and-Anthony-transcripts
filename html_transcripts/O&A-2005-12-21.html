<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the ongoing New York City transit strike, fueled by the hosts' own colds and their scathing criticism of union leader Roger Toussaint, whom they labeled a "publicity hound" and accused of prioritizing self-promotion over negotiation.  The hosts detailed the resulting traffic chaos and the opportunistic behavior of cab drivers, interspersed with numerous listener calls recounting their personal struggles with the commute.  A news story about a train conductor engaging in sexual activity with a passenger was also discussed.  The conversation then veered towards a perceived slight from Philadelphia radio station WYSP, specifically mentioning DJ Barsky, and a critique of Steve Harveyâ€™s stance on free radio, all punctuated by copious profanity.

The broadcast continued with descriptions of the hosts' studio as a chaotic "flop house" where staff, including Master Poe and Travis, slept, leading to humorous anecdotes about their sleeping arrangements and a near-miss observation of a staff member engaging in oral sex.  Further listener calls detailed their frustrations, including one recounting an incident where the hosts' discussion about Santa Claus upset a child.  This "There's No Santa" call was replayed.  The hosts also offered their strong opinions on the New York Yankees' acquisition of Johnny Damon and promoted their show's "Wow" bumper stickers and a recent "homeless shopping spree" event. The segment concluded with a comedic critique of E-Rock's recording of intros for a "best of" show, again punctuated by numerous listener calls and audio clips from past shows.

A "best of" segment featured Howie Mandel as a studio guest and focused heavily on extended, vulgar teasing of staff member Eric. This involved the unveiling of a document, "One Thousand Reasons to Hate Eric," detailing various grievances, including allegations of credit-hoarding, poor time management, and a $100,000 lottery win.  The segment included sound effects, voice tracks from Eric and E-Rock, and ended with an awkward, forced series of handshakes and hugs between the hosts and Eric, along with humorous anecdotes about the phone screeners and several listener calls contributing to the Eric-centric ribbing. The "suck my fucking cock" jingle was repeatedly referenced.

The show then shifted to a forced interaction between studio personalities, leading to an awkward handshake. This segued into a phone call with Ben, who refused to hug a coworker and used homophobic slurs.  The hosts discussed existing tension between team members, notably between Poe and Eric, with Eric airing grievances about Poe's behavior.

The broadcast's final major segment featured a phone interview with "Gangster Fag," a self-proclaimed gay gangster rapper who graphically detailed his criminal history, including armed robbery, drug dealing, and the rape of men he robbed.  The conversation was filled with explicit language, homophobic slurs, and graphic descriptions of sexual acts.  Gangster Fag promoted his music and merchandise throughout the interview, with the hosts and callers reacting with a mix of amusement, disbelief, and outrage.  This segment also included promotion of Gangsta Fag's website (Gangstafag.com), a future betting show, Jim Norton's New Year's Eve show in Philadelphia, and the upcoming Ron and Fez show.  The interview was dominated by sexually explicit and offensive language, focusing on homosexual acts, particularly in prison settings, with Gangsta Fag performing his song "Twisted Life."  The hosts and callers frequently responded with similarly explicit and offensive language.

[00:05:00]  of this palaver.  Let's get the show  on the road.  Okay, terrific.  Hello, exactly.  Do you want to kiss me?  We look like assholes  right now, man. 
[00:05:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You have something to say.  I have something to say.  All right, so let's just talk.  Ma, please stop pulling me.  I've seen cops  knocking the truck window out  and I thought they was  giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  The man was dead.  That's why we striking. 
[00:06:00]  Ah, the strike.  Day two of the transit strike  in New York City.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program  on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  The only virus spreading across America  and spreading across my lungs  as I speak.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God.  Are you sickly?  I was laughing, man.  I was dodging virus  after virus  after virus. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Is it an actual virus?  I don't know.  The flu, the cold, whatever.  Whatever they call it.  And people were coming  into work  sick all around us.  And I was laughing it off  like,  ha, ha, ha,  you can't get me  laughing.  Poe sick.  E-rock sick.  Everyone was sick around us.  Yep.  For weeks.  Sore throats.  And finally,  it hit me like  two or three days ago.  I'm miserable.  Absolutely miserable.  I think one of those 
[00:07:00]  savages we call our listeners  probably had it  when we did our  J&R music appearance.  Shook hands  with a clammy  fucking disease hand.  Because you were sick  yesterday too, right?  A little bit?  No, about two,  three days ago  I had scratchy throat.  That was it?  Mm-hmm.  Well, I got, uh...  Seemed to go away.  I got a, uh,  a deep cold  and Norton is trying  to tell me that  coldies will take care of it.  I just want to punch somebody.  It helps if you  take it early.  Because everyone has  a stupid remedy  to get rid of this shit 
[00:07:30]  but they still don't know  how to get rid  of the common cold.  Coldies helps  if you take it early.  Oh, so does chicken  fucking soup.  I had that last night.  I like chicken soup.  And it's so tasty.  It certainly is.  Yes.  Someone said,  try emergency.  I got enough emergency  for everybody.  Emergency?  I asked  I'd call Kenny yesterday  for two,  two emergencies  because he went  to the store for me.  Yeah.  He goes, uh,  they have raspberry  and, uh, lemon lime.  Which ones do you want?  I go, ah, get me one of each.  Meaning one packet of each.  He comes back  with a box of each. 
[00:08:00]  And each box  has about, uh,  40 of them in.  And what's that shit  supposed to do?  It does shit.  It's actually  a lot of vitamin C.  It just fucking takes your money.  When you get, uh,  you start getting a cold,  do you take it?  I've been taking it.  Everyone on the set  has been sick  since I've been taking it  every day.  On the set, right.  On the set, of course.  Something we all  could fucking relate to.  Yeah, you know.  Because we're all  on the fucking set.  Oh, it's fun.  And they've all been, uh,  God, take me away  from this miserable life.  But, uh,  cold ease works  if you take it on time.  If you take it early,  it kills it.  If you take it too late, 
[00:08:30]  it doesn't matter.  It doesn't work.  Yeah, it does.  Nothing works.  It does.  It's a cold.  I think it's one of those things.  Dude, I could take  ten phone calls right now.  Everyone will swear  that they have the cure.  Nothing works.  You ever get a cold  or feel like a cold's coming on  and then it just goes away  and you never got it?  That's what those people think  is that working.  Right.  Like, they take it and go,  dude, I started getting a cold  and it went away.  Like, you could give them  a fucking Pez  and they'll be like,  dude, I Pez,  I swear by it  because I was getting sick. 
[00:09:00]  I took a Pez  and, uh, it went away.  Yeah.  I've done it enough times  when I was just getting sick  with cold ease  and I'm telling you,  that, you see,  a lot of zinc and zinc lozenge  are great.  If it really worked,  then you'd be a multi-millionaire.  I didn't invent it.  Whoever did it is,  you could be the spokesperson.  No, they won't have me  because I'm too dirty.  Dude, I,  someone goes,  try Airborne.  Oh, fuck.  I went,  know how much Airborne  I've taken the last four days?  How much?  It didn't make a difference.  Airborne stinks.  Well, they're selling it like crazy  because there are people 
[00:09:30]  out there that are believing  in that.  They're believing  in the God that is Airborne.  Dude, I fly a lot.  I know about this stuff.  I'm constantly on airplanes.  It doesn't work.  Back from here  in Wilderland  and back in the set  to here.  Those flying disease spreaders.  Yeek.  There you go.  Don't use coldies.  All right.  And Jimmy's pissed off  that I didn't go  to the stupid drugstore  last night  after we walked home  to get coldies.  I'm like,  it's not going to work.  I'm telling you,  it works.  Coldies works.  It doesn't work.  Who says coldies doesn't work?  Paul on Long Island.  Oh, Paul's a dumbass.  Hey, Jimmy,  I took that coldies. 
[00:10:00]  They gave me like  fucking mega diarrhea  for like two days.  Great.  It was probably  you're cold,  you idiot.  You shit out the...  Paul,  it doesn't give you diarrhea.  They gave me diarrhea.  I ate like three of them.  Yeah.  Maybe not supposed...  You eat three in a day.  You're not supposed  to eat three in a row.  I did it in a...  They're not candy, sir.  They're medicine.  Yeah, well...  They taste awful.  Why would you eat three?  I'm here to say  that nothing works.  I don't want to hear it  from anyone.  Thank you for that,  Jimmy. 
[00:10:30]  That works.  Early in the morning,  I popped a Benadryl.  It put me in la-la land  and now I'm on Sudafed.  That works  until it goes away  on its own  when the stupid cold  decides it's had enough  and it moves on.  I like all the doctors  that instant feedback in.  Like Dr. Tribal Rage  from Whack Bag.  Yeah.  Dr. Skin Beef.  Yeah.  All the doctors.  The current bug going around  can't be helped  with anything.  You just have to wait it out. 
[00:11:00]  No.  And did Opie come in  to work in a robe today?  Yes.  He has his robe on  and his little tissues  that he keeps crumbled up  in one hand.  One shaking hand.  And didn't we just do  a radio show?  Weren't we just here?  Oh my God.  We were.  This is crazy.  I don't even know  what happened.  All I know is we did  the homeless shopping spree.  It was a huge success.  We're going to rerun  the show Friday, right?  Friday?  I left the studio  12 hours ago.  12 hours ago  I left the studio.  Right. 
[00:11:30]  And I was back  I don't know.  What time did I get in?  2 a.m.?  Whatever it was.  I got in  so early this morning.  I left my house  4.10.  4.10.  The alarm went off  at 4.  I shot up out of bed  panicked  threw clothes on  brushed my teeth  out the fucking door.  And trying to beat  the 5 o'clock  HOV restriction 
[00:12:00]  here in New York City.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Curfew.  Well, just explain  for the rest of the country  this transit strike.  The one thing that's going on  because Manhattan  is just a tiny little island  and you got bridges  and tunnels, okay?  Yep.  Most people know  what Manhattan looks like  but just in case you don't.  So they don't want you  driving into Manhattan  unless you have  four people in your car  between the hours  of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m.  And 11 a.m.  Big transit strike  going on here.  Everybody knows about that.  National story.  And apparently  7 million people 
[00:12:30]  commute,  use the subway  or some type of  public transportation  on a daily basis  here in the city.  So that's 7 million people  that have to find  some alternate way  to work.  Right.  So in order to keep  so many cars  out of the city,  if all those people  decided, well,  the buses and trains  aren't working,  I'll just take a car in,  the city would be  gridlocked  like you wouldn't believe.  Couldn't move.  So they decide  four people per car  or else you're not  getting in the city 
[00:13:00]  between 5 a.m.  and 11 a.m.  So yesterday  was a clusterfuck.  Not enough time.  They announced the strike  so late  or early in the morning  that no one had  a chance to do anything.  People were driving in.  They didn't know  they needed the four people.  They're turning people around.  It was rush hour hell.  Well, this morning  I had the bright idea  of leaving  in time to beat  the 5 o'clock  HOV restriction  along with 
[00:13:30]  everyone else  on Long Island.  Yeah, what happened  it turned out to be  rush hour at 4 in the morning  here in New York City.  4.15  on the expressway here  was like  8 o'clock in the morning.  It was rush hour.  But there were a few people  driving like maniacs  just to get around  and to make  because I'm looking  at the road  looking at the clock  looking at the road  looking at the clock  alright, I'm doing good  I can't  if I miss this 5 o'clock  I'm sunk  because you can get 
[00:14:00]  right to the  midtown tunnel  which is what I take in  or you can take  the Queensborough Bridge  whatever  5 o'clock  bing  you're not over that bridge  you're not in the tunnel  they will turn you  right the fuck around  and tell you  to get the hell out of here  you are not welcome  here in New York  find three more people  and so I drove in  made it in  I think I signed in  at 5  I might have to leave  earlier tomorrow  any problem 
[00:14:30]  on that expressway  I am talking  a car pulled over  and a police car  with shiny lights  to slow traffic down  and I'm fucked  so I'm going to have to  even leave  a little earlier  it's just a mess  it's absolutely  a mess in New York  and the person  the news are trying  to make it a cute  little story  no it's not cute  it's not cute  people are ready  to kill each other  out there  and it's only day 2  that's right  and that scumbag  that is in charge  of the transit union 
[00:15:00]  what's his name  Roger Toussaint  Roger Toussaint  this scumbag  publicity hound  this guy is no better  than that fucking  rapist fireman  as far as  wanting publicity  you know that guy  wanted all the publicity  for what he did  Bronstein  exactly what this  scumbag  fuckwad  is doing now  he is holding  New York City  hostage  he is holding  people's ability 
[00:15:30]  to get to work  hostage  as a negotiating  tool  for union workers  that in my opinion  and I've done  a lot of reading  on this  so transit workers  can call  we have no problem  with them voicing  their point  they're getting  a pretty good  fucking deal  and it wasn't like  that was the final deal  the MTA  was still at the table  still completely  willing to bargain  with these guys  they were making  headway  there wasn't 
[00:16:00]  a log jam  there wasn't  some  end all  thing  that they said  no we will  absolutely not  do this  they were still  bargaining  but this  scumbag  wanted publicity  so bad  that above and  beyond their  bosses  the international  version of their  union  they went on  strike  the international  version of the  transit union  said hey  we never said  to fucking  strike  we don't  condone this  strike  get back to  work  and this guy  every day  no  we are being 
[00:16:30]  held hostage  by the mayor  and the governor  and the  and the MTA  MTA  they're the ones  sitting at the  table asshole  you know what  you should be  running the union  if you can't say  MTA  MTA  MTA  how about the  rock court for  the man  you know what  would just  make everybody  laugh their  balls off  do what  Ronnie Reagan  did with the  air traffic  controllers  fire  every one of  these motherfuckers 
[00:17:00]  fire  every single  one of these  transit worker  douchebags  that are  fucking  on picket lines  right now  fire them  bring in the  fucking  national guard  do some kind  of aggressive  training program  get a  fucking  monkey  to push  that handle  to make  the train  go  pull it  back  it stops  give anyone  ten minutes  in one of  those boxes  on wheels  and they'll  know how  to run  it  fire them  fire them  you don't  want to  work  boom  you're 
[00:17:30]  gone  we'll train  some  fucking  monkeys  to do  your work  they offered  I don't know  what they  wanted  but they  offered  them  they said  three percent  then four  percent  then three  point five  percent  which is  like ten  point five  percent over  the next  three years  over the next  three years  he wanted  six percent  a year  and they  said they  were willing  the MTA  said they're  willing to  go further  they were  negotiating  they were  talking it  out at a  table  the MTA  didn't say  fuck you  and your  union  we're leaving  and then the  union goes  well you know  what we strike  they were  talking  they were  having a  conversation 
[00:18:00]  like other  people do  there are  unions that  can't strike  there are  police unions  teachers  unions  they negotiate  contracts  they work  without  contracts  they don't  fucking  strike  it's illegal  there are  laws against  it because  they're vital  to a city  working and  operating  they are  holding it  hostage and  like Opie  mentioned  yesterday  Ed Koch  who I guess  is on the  phone now  live again  this guy's  getting a lot  of press  time  brought up  the fact 
[00:18:30]  that he  was the  mayor in  1980 when  we had  the last  visit strike  he brought  up the  fact that  this union  has done  what the  terrorists  have never  succeeded in  doing  completely  shutting down  the New York  City transit  system  we don't need  to be scared  of Al Qaeda  we need to be  scared of  ourselves  we do it  to ourselves  look at these  bridges this  morning  just a ton  of people  trying to  walk to  work  and there's  stories in  all the  papers  one guy's  walking 16  miles each  way just  to go to  work  just to go  to work  because he 
[00:19:00]  has to  doesn't he  have a friend  with a car  how about  hiring some  homeless people  to jump  in a car  with you  that car  would stink  forever  I can't  wait for  those stories  to come  out  because  the cute  news  is  hey I  see you  found some  new friends  today  yeah we  found them  I needed  two now  we got  four now  I can  drive around  wait for  the real  stories to  come out  some poor  chick that  needs to  go to  work  so she  picks up  three guys  gets raped  and they're  gangbangers  well that  could happen  but something 
[00:19:30]  a little  more realistic  that could  happen  I was  watching a  program  yesterday  on people's  insurance  do you know  people have a  minimum of  insurance in  this country  you never  really get the  amount of  insurance you  need to  cover yourself  in an  accident with  a car  you get  enough  to cover  the law  by law  you have  to be  insured  if you  load three  people in  your car  and you  have an  accident  you're  liable  your insurance  company is  liable  based on 
[00:20:00]  how much  you pay  in and  how much  you get  out  for the  health  and medical  care  of those  three people  that are now  in your car  you know  who's responsible  above and  beyond what  the insurance  pays out  you  motherfucker  you  you're  responsible  so now  all of a sudden  you're being  a good guy  you're driving  three people  you get into  an accident  now you're  being sued  it's  there's so much 
[00:20:30]  risk out there  because of this  the transit  union is  putting people  at risk  their health  their safety  their welfare  financial welfare  all this  as a  negotiating tool  could you  imagine  if you  you have  your job  I don't know  you work in  an office  somewhere  and you  have the  ability  to fuck  over  everyone else  that works  in the city  you work in  just to get  a raise  or just to get  the medical  benefits you  want  or to get 
[00:21:00]  your retirement  age  to keep it  where it is  instead of  pushing it up  where everyone  else's is  here's another  sticking point  their retirement  age right now  they can get  a full pension  at 55  years old  55 years  old  in this  day and age  ain't old  that's plenty  of time to  relax on a  fucking beach  somewhere with  a full pension  they want to  push it up  to 62  years old  only for new  employees  not for the  people that are  there already 
[00:21:30]  for new  employees that  come aboard  and that is a  huge sticking  point with  the union  what makes  them so  fucking special  what stress  and pressure  is so great  on that job  that they  want to be  equal with  police officers  and people  that are  under such  stress on  a daily  basis  that a  retirement  at 55  is justifiable  for certain  jobs  a fucking  test pilot  should be  able to  retire  at 55  not a 
[00:22:00]  goddamn  chimp  that pushes  a fucking  handle that  says forward  and backwards  you're on  a track  you're on  a track  jesus christ  open the  door  please stand  clear of the  doors  stand clear of  the doors  oof  i'm exhausted  i gotta retire  you don't even  get the opportunity  to go left  or right  you can't  make a turn  you don't even  have a wheel  right  give me a  break 
[00:22:30]  it's just an  up and down  knob  it's forward  and stop  that's it  and most of  it is done  with the  electronic  signaling  devices  and  what not  you've heard  those stories  of the  conductors in  there  getting blow  jobs  and fucking  women  letting them  drive the  train  this happened  a few months  back  there was  some guy  he's driving  the train  and some  chick I guess  it was late  at night  is in the  car behind  and she  comes up  and starts 
[00:23:00]  having a  conversation  he invites her  in a little  booth  in the front  of the train  where the  little go  handle is  and she's  sitting on  his lap  running the  train  making the  stops at  the station  as he is  fondling her  tits and  ass  how did he  get caught  now okay  there's one  of the good  guys  but he's  one of the  guys who  is actually  pushing for  62  no kidding  man  I want to  go back  to work  I want to  he was  crossing the  line  believe me  yeah  scab  how did he  get caught 
[00:23:30]  she ratted  out  really  yes she  ratted out  said he  was assaulting  her and  groping her  but I  mean  you want to  drive the  train bitch  you gotta pay  a price  that's right  you want to  sit on daddy's  lap  you gotta block  that memory  out  you want to  ride the  train  same thing  well we got  some audio  people just  losing their  minds out  there  we start  with this  one  and if  you think  this entire  process is  not taking  an emotional  toll on  people  I want you  to listen  to this  woman named  Emma Harris  I pay $180 
[00:24:00]  monthly  for the  number two  three  I pay $76  every month  then I have  to pay a taxi  I'm a poor  woman in this  country  and we need  to have  our transportation  you see  most of us  out here  need transportation  it's not easy  out here  they are out  there rich  they don't know  what's going on  out here  we are poor  people out here  we need  transportation  I'm not  young anymore 
[00:24:30]  I'm up  and down  have to go  to work  so Bloomberg  and  should wake  up  what  we should  point out  though that  Mayor Bloomberg  is not  directly involved  in negotiations  in this  transit strike  you know what  by the way  I don't  want to  I think  I'm trying  to figure out  her accent  I want to  say Midwestern  yeah  that's what  I was thinking  well a little  um  a little  southwestern  too  thrown in there  Midwestern  with a hint  of Santa Maria  holy shit  shut up 
[00:25:00]  shut up  and I've  watched  so many  interviews  on television  90% of the  people they're  interviewing  are black  people  what's going  on  where's Whitey  where is  Whitey at  on a while  on the railroad  Whitey's  wandering around  trying to get  a couple more  drivers in his  car  is that what  it is  oh yeah  man  they love  interviewing  black people  on the news  so you don't  take mass  transit  in New York  mass  transit  you wouldn't  catch me  on there  either 
[00:25:30]  it's uh  Whitey's a  minority  on the  trains  I wish I  knew more  about it  I would  take it  I just  don't need  it that  much  I don't  do that  much  during the  day  people have  asked me  well why don't  you take the  Long Island  Railroad  because that  goes into  Penn Station  and then what  do I do  from Penn  to here  I take a  little walk  subway  no  no  there's no  subway  there is no  subway  that's why  there's a  problem  Jimmy  see I  could take  the Long  Island  Railroad  in  during the  strike  but then  what do  you do  and the 
[00:26:00]  Long  Island  Railroad  is a  mess  right  now  they were  showing  pictures  of Jamaica  that were  just lines  of people  screaming  at workers  that knew  nothing  they had  people in  orange vests  railroad  workers  with bull  horns  and people  on the  other side  of the  gates  screaming  with that  horrific  Long  Island  accent  I've  got to  get to  work  my  family  depends  on my  money  and I  can't  get it  and the  people 
[00:26:30]  like I'm  sorry  you're just  going to  have to  wait on  this line  but I've  got to  get over  the  just a  mess  and then  I'm  looking  going  yeah  that's  where I  want to  be  that's  where I  want to  take a  train  to  that's  the  beauty  of  something  like  this  everyone's  real  personality  comes  out  oh yeah  because all  these  people think  they're the  most important  person in  to be  somewhere  obviously  yeah  that's  the whole  point  everyone  that's  going  somewhere  has to  be  somewhere  and it's  no 
[00:27:00]  they  your  somewhere  is no  more  important  than  someone  else's  somewhere  to  them  Mayor  Bloomberg  very  important  that he  get from  his point  A to  point  B  he's  doing  a lot  for the  city  but as  far as  the guy  that works  at  a deli  his  getting to  the deli  is just  as important  to him  so  to start  screaming  at people  doesn't make  any sense  no  you hear this  guy  cabbies 
[00:27:30]  are charging  people that  don't know  usually it's  a metered  fair here  in New York  I'll hop  in where I  work  I'm like  15 blocks  from here  it comes  to like  560  and now  they're zoning  so it's  10 bucks  a pop  which is  fine  because it's  just fast  get in  get out  okay  and they're  taken up to  four people  at a clip  so they  can't  they don't  have four  separate  meters  depending on  who's  getting in  where  and who's  getting out  so what  they do  is charge  a flat fee  now  these  cabbies  are making  a bloody  fortune  hand over  fist  well this  guy  I kind of  like this  guy  but cabbie  he punched  the woman  in the face  good 
[00:28:00]  god bless  him  what did  she do  she was at  like 88th  and 1st  and he took  her to  87 blocks  and then  wanted an  extra 5  on top  of the  $10  was it  past the  zone  I don't  know  because it's  10 bucks  within a  zone  so if  you're  say in  zone  G  and you're  going from  somewhere in  zone G  to somewhere  else in  zone G  that's 10  bucks  if you cross  over into  another zone  even though  that's only  maybe 3 or  4 blocks  it could be 
[00:28:30]  a block  into another  zone  it's an  extra  like 5 bucks  she refused  to pay it  though she  should have  punch her  in the face  then  I'm not  saying that's  not the way  to handle  a mouthy  bitch  I'm just  saying that  that was  yeah  these cabbies  are just  zippy  do da  zippy  de  oh they're  loving it  they're just  making a fortune  I tried to  get one  this morning  they took  the cars  sometimes  they'll hang  outside the  building  and try to  grab fares  they're not  luxury cars  but they're  nicer than  cabs  and it's  usually 10  bucks  the guy's  quoted me  many times  I won't  take them  it's too  much  it's like  5 bucks  so I  see today  how much 
[00:29:00]  and he  goes 15  and I'm  like I'm  such a bad  bargain  I'm like 10  and he  wouldn't look  at me  so I walked  away  I'm the  consumer  something like  an 8 dollar  fare  that's right  opie  an 8 dollar  fare now  is now at  least $40  that he's  making  where normally  the same  distance driven  would have  been 8 bucks  something like  that  plus tip  you tip  those animals  always  I give them 
[00:29:30]  like 6 bucks  extra  I tip them  little piece  of raw meat  throw it  into the front  seat  watch them  ravage it  alright we got  more audio  this is the  big story  today man  I think  everyone  can  double  yeah  and at  Penn Station  last night  everyone's  trying to get  back on the  trains to go  back out to  Long Island  it was like  a cattle  call  man  they didn't  know what  to do  it was  unbelievable  you couldn't  just go  into Penn  Station  knowing  let's say  your train  left at  720  no you  had to  wait on  this  massive  line  that went  for blocks  to slowly  make it 
[00:30:00]  into Penn  and then  I guess  try to figure  out what  train  you can  take  from there  they said  they didn't  want that  amount of  people on  the platform  to avoid  people being  shoved  onto the  tracks  just from  the sheer  mass of  people  so they  were keeping  them upstairs  in Penn  until the  train was  announced  and then  they'd  bring them  down  the trouble  is  you don't  know what  track your  train's coming  to  it's very  confusing in  there to  newbies  especially  if you've 
[00:30:30]  never ridden  on the  railroad  and it's  not like  other  massive  people  you can't  now move  say you're  near  track  20  you can't  then at  the drop  of a hat  go to  track  12  because  there's  so many  people in  the way  you're going  to miss  the train  and that's  what it  was  Penn  station  in general  is fucked  up  every other  train station  in America  is nice  it's like  track 1  2  3  right in  order  Penn  station  it's like  12  18  17  19  and 20  over there  12 
[00:31:00]  and 14  are over  here  there's no rhyme  or reason  to how those  tracks are set up  you know what I  really hate about  that  it's never  the same  place  twice  for the track  or the train  so you  say you gotta  go out to  Huntington Long  Island from  New York  you would  think  you'd go  into Penn  go to the  same place  you went to  yesterday  to make  that trip  go downstairs  and wait  for your  train  doesn't happen  that way  at like  three minutes  before the  train leaves  it pulls  into the  station  they go  Huntington 
[00:31:30]  track 24  track 24  and you're  and you're like  track 24  did he  say 24  you can't  hear him  now you gotta  run to  track 24  because the  train's gonna  leave soon  they give you  limited notice  that this is  happening  and with the  place packed  like it was  yesterday  you couldn't  get through the  crowd  this is a  clusterfuck  directly to  blame  the transit  union  fire them  fire them  more audio  10 bucks  just to get in  the cab  what do you  think about that  I did that  yesterday  I thought the  cab driver was  ripping me off  I wanted to go 
[00:32:00]  over to  Madison Avenue  and 52nd Street  from 44th Street  and 6th Avenue  it was kind of  cool  he said 10 bucks  I said what are  you ripping me  off because he  said no  there's a new  law that each  zone  track fares  10 bucks  and another 5  in a new zone  Eddie thank you  we're gonna help  Eddie get a cab  anyone from  Midtown  alright guys  trying out here  back to you  yeah these reporters  are just having a  ball with this  like it's another  one  this is just like  fun  this is just like  one of those  cute snowstorms  right  they're out there 
[00:32:30]  just laughing  and laughing  a cabbie should  have punched  that woman in the  face  trying to make  it sound like  it's all just  fun for everybody  15 bucks  to go 7 blocks  he should be  shot for that  can you believe  the cabbies  are so excited  they love it  they're certainly  loving this  now you hit a  little snag  when you came up  here what happened  you need 4 people  to cross the  Holland Tunnel  and you didn't  know that  I didn't know that  so there were  two guys in the  car  you know I  hopped in so  we could all  talk to you  but I'm going to  get out  and what are  you going to  do now  I don't know 
[00:33:00]  I'm going to  wait until 11  or I'm going to  see if I find  somebody  two more people  two more people  to cross  so people are  now wandering  around just  picking up  strangers  wherever they  can  that's safe  here in the  city  welcome to  my life  that's safe  in the city  what a great  opportunity for  carjacking  Jesus  those stories  will come out  starting tomorrow  you watch  believe me  how can the  hookers get in  trouble now  we're just  waiting here to  be rides  three rides  got your finger 
[00:33:30]  deep inside one  the other one  sucking you off  one of the  backseat watching  I say bring back  the tunnel bunnies  yeah  tunnel bunnies  for everybody  want to help a guy  out  who cleaned up  the tunnel bunnies  was that  Giuliani  Giuliani  oh and here  is Mayor  Bloomberg  once again  walking across  the Brooklyn  Bridge  westbound  very heavy  this morning  between the  Cross Island  Parkway and  the fairgrounds  we didn't see  that yesterday  stop doing  traffic reports  we know  it's a mess  we know  it's a mess 
[00:34:00]  Cross Island  Parkway and  the White Stone  as your alternate  now I can show  you the other  side of the  spectrum  Steve  take a look  at the BQE  yesterday we  talked about  delays on the  BQE  as bad as  Joe Nolan and I  had ever seen  here you can  see the BQE  moving at a  reasonably good  clip  what they did  in a lot of  spots was  they moved  those HOV  checkpoints  to the actual  entrance ramps  on the BQE  and the Gowanus  so the result  of that is that  once you're on  the Gowanus  or the BQE  oh so they had  them on the  actual highway 
[00:34:30]  at first  now they're  moving them  to the ramp  so now you  can't even  get on the  highway  that's kind  of smart  well the good  thing is New  York City  does figure  out this shit  if you give  it a couple  days  a day or two  yeah  sounds like  that traffic  reporter needs  some coldies  by the way  little coldies  he's got a  little stuffy  nose as well  a little stuffy  nose  hopefully he's  okay  the traffic  does seem  to be moving  that's exactly  what they've  done  to a certain  extent  Steven  I think  enough  with the  mayor's  walking across  the bridge  it's cute  we get it 
[00:35:00]  we get it  you're just  like us  you're just  like us  except that  you have  like 20  fucking  guys  protecting you  there's  bodyguards  all around  him  those are  all bodyguards  following the  mayor across  the Brooklyn  bridge  because he's  just like  you and I  why is he  looking from  Brooklyn  he lives in  Manhattan  because it's  the thing to do  he was sleeping  at the  federal emergency  management headquarters  over there  you know what  I kind of like  Bloomberg  Bloomberg's great  he hasn't done  anything  I like Bloomberg 
[00:35:30]  but it's just  like this is just  a photo op  stop  he's  he's kind  of you know  he can be  an asshole  when it comes  to certain  issues  but I  defy you  to find  one mayor  that like  you don't  have some  issues with  um  David  Dickens  oof  Jesus  picked a good  one  and uh  yeah but  Bloomberg's been  pretty good  I know  I just hate  these photo ops  though  oh yeah  and his voice  is kind of  annoying  there's something  about Bloomberg  that just makes  you hate him  here's the problem  he's the mayor  of New York  City  there's a 
[00:36:00]  transit strike  going on  he's wasting  an hour right  now to walk  across the  Brooklyn Bridge  to show  everyone he's  just like  you and I  how about  use that hour  to try to  do what you  can even  though he's  in a weird  position himself  here  do you know  he can hop  in a fucking  gulf stream jet  and fly across  the river  because he's  that rich  right  we have the  richest mayor  in the country  this guy gives  millions a year  to charity  he's a billionaire  he's a multi  billionaire  you know what  I need to come  to work today  so we are  seeing a very  steady stream 
[00:36:30]  of traffic  here at this  HOV checkpoint  at 96 and  Sethkin Avenue  and police  really making  no exceptions  you've got to  have four people  in your vehicle  things moving  along pretty  orderly  now we talked  to a guy  earlier who was  driving solo  it took him  an hour and a  half  and he finally  had company  so you found  three new friends  yeah  are you going to  drop everybody  off or are you  just going to  yeah no I  got to drop  them off  one of them  is going to  42nd  the other  one is going  to 59th 
[00:37:00]  the other  one is going  to 85th  so if I had  to drop them  off then go  to my job  pitch the ride  oh good for you  it's so nice  pitch the ride  gentlemen  to 49th  and 59th  so you're  planning on  walking  yeah  we've got to  walk over  but at least  we don't have to  walk 50 blocks  like we did  yesterday afternoon  50 blocks  four babbling  strangers  this is a new  reality hopefully  it's not real  for very long  now we've been  talking about  these charter  buses  alright  four  just babbling  boring 
[00:37:30]  strangers  in your fucking  car  wait I live  below 96th  street so if I  can just drive  my car solo  like they won't  stop you if  you're solo  no if you're  in the city  you're fine  I may go up  to 95th street  and just go  to 96th and go  I'm alone  fuck you  and jam my  finger up  with all the  motorists  just drive around  in circles  in front of the  people that can't  get in  I might back up  right to the  checkpoint  like an inch  before 96th street  and when the  cop says something  I say  beat it flat foot  and I zoom south 
[00:38:00]  you lousy screw  take a walk  for yourself  zoom south  here's some more  audio waiting for  the long island  railroad in  jamaica  this is where  it's a real  mess  yes  pretty much  about the  same  like instead  of the  service  attacking us  we're attacking  ourselves  it's like a  metro jihad  yesterday I  couldn't go  today I'm  going  after all  it's a job  I'm supposed 
[00:38:30]  to be at  7th  so that's  the reason  why I'm  here  early today  but you  bagged work  yesterday  yes  no I  went to  the doctor  yesterday  of course  yes of  course  please go  back to  work and  negotiate  it will work  better  please  you don't  have to get  up so early  right  right  please thank  you  where is the  Yankee  Frankie shop  with union  with union  members to  come back  to work  a couple  of numbers  we want to  throw out  at you  the Long  Island  Railroad  yesterday  handled an  additional  50,000  extra people  tack those 
[00:39:00]  on to the  100,000  that they  normally deal  with every  day and  the best  news of  all no  injuries  nobody hurt  they'd like  to keep that  be the same  thing  asshole  best news  of all  wouldn't an  injury and  nobody hurt  be the same  thing  no deaths  and nobody  died  thanks  you redundant  cunt  thanks Ben  let's go to  I think you  pissed a few  people off  Anthony  let's say  hi to  Jimmy  Brooklyn  good  well first  of all  I want to  say Jimmy  I saw you  on the  webcam  the other  day  you look 
[00:39:30]  good bro  you look  like you're  getting healthier  maybe it's  just the sun  out in  California  he is  he's lost  some weight  oh thanks  man  and by  the way  happy birthday  Anthony  you gotta look  at it like  this  the union  had to do  what they  had to do  the MTA  has turned  around  and asked  for an  arbiter  or a  mediator  because  now they're  saying  they're  an impasse  am I  happy  that they're  on strike  no  but am I  following  the daily  news  headline  of mad  as hell  or the  post  headline  of you  rats 
[00:40:00]  no  they had  to do  what they  had  to do  why  why did  they have  to strike  when people  when they  were still  dealing at  the table  but they  weren't  Anthony  yes they  were  no they  were  they  absolutely  were  did the  MTA  fucking  walk off  no the  MTA  did not  walk off  I'm not  arguing  the MTA  was making  them  valid  offers  but the  MTA  turned around  and said  this is our  last offer  we're not  making another  offer  have you ever  been in a  negotiation  as a matter of  fact yes  I'm a union  member  and when is  the last  offer  actually a  last offer 
[00:40:30]  the last  offer  is when the  MTA  gives an  offer  and doesn't  fucking come  back to the  table  the fact that  they come  back to the  table tells  you that  there's a  little more  out there  and if you  sit and talk  like civilized  human beings  and don't hold  the city  hostage  you might get  a little more  but Anthony  they're not  holding the  city  hostage  yes they  are  no they're  not  is it a  pain in  the ass  yeah  work without  a fucking  contract  until you  hammer a  deal out  like the  teachers do  and the  cops  alright Anthony  you don't  want to hear 
[00:41:00]  anything  you want to  hear your  point of  view  no I'm  listening to  your point  you haven't  made a  point though  the guy  didn't make  a fucking  point  he's saying  that what  the MTA  is holding  the city  hostage  I think his  point mainly  was that like  I look like I  had lost a few  pounds  Jimmy looks  great  okay he had  one valid  point  he is a  cute little  guy  I'm a  puggle with  AIDS  let's go to  Chris in  Delaware  Chris what's  up  hey you guys  this is  Chris I  don't know if  you remember  I was in  the eggnog

[00:42:00]  WYSP in  Philadelphia  bashing XM  bashing everything  telling everybody  how they're great  how it's free  and everything  and then they're  talking like  Jimmy's his  best fucking  friend  I guess it's  this new DJ  Barsky on  94.1 WYSP  Barsky  yeah I don't  know if you  guys have heard  of him  I'm hearing  some things out  of Philly and I  hope it's not  true but I'm  hearing that  Kid Chris or  someone on his  stupid show on  YSP has been  taking shots at  us and I'm  like what the 
[00:42:30]  fuck we used to  be friends with  Kid Chris and  now he's turning  his back for what  reason  so we're trying to  get to the bottom  of it but  supposedly there's  been some real  trashing going on  on that radio  station I want to  know exactly what  went on  it's 94.1  now we know  the station we  put them on the  map  they're actually  sponsoring my  New Year's Eve  show  YSP was a  powerhouse in  Philly I'm not  going to lie to  you sure but  then Ant and I  got syndicated to  YSP and just  blew up we had  massive ratings 
[00:43:00]  and made that  station even bigger  and we moved on  because we had to  with everything that  happened with us  now I'm hearing  rumors that  something's going  on down there  where they're  trashing us pretty  bad on Kid  Chris's show  I don't know if  it's true but  I've had a few  people tell me  that some shit  has been going  on and I want  to know what the  fuck that's about  now I actually  I spoke to him  and he said  it wasn't true  I mean look  if anyone out  there has a  tape fine  but I asked  and he goes 
[00:43:30]  no there was  nothing said  so are you  talking about  that dude  or are you  saying that  what are you  talking about  I was listening  about three  days ago  and they were  talking about  Barsky had  some guest on  and they were  talking about  how great  the free FM  was and how  you don't have  to have this  subscription  it's better  than this  and then they're  trying to make  you sound like  they're your best  friend and they  used to hang out  we never hung  out with Barsky  Barsky's a faggot  I've never heard  of a Barsky  Barsky's a guy 
[00:44:00]  that's been stuck  in Philly radio  for his entire  life  he's miserable  and now YSP  has him I guess  you can't blame  them for trashing  satellite in general  that's fine  that's what they  have to do  that's their whole  thing  it's called  free radio  so they gotta  bash the enemy  which is pay radio  stupid Steve Harvey  was on the  American Music Awards  the other night  I was watching that  I don't give a fuck  if he's black  white yellow  or fucking pink  he's an ass  and he isn't  unfunny  he's an ass  with the strangest  black toupee  I've ever seen 
[00:44:30]  in my life  is he a toupee  holy  you don't think  that's a toupee  I don't know  it might be  that's why he wears  the silly fucking hat  to hide the silly  toupee  I think I'm in Hulk  someone find  a picture of Steve Harvey  you tell me that's not  a black toupee  it's very rare  by the way  the black toupee  is a very rare thing  Steve Harvey has one  and one of these  news guys in New York  has one as well  and it's very fun  and remind me  after you're done  talking to address  the awful face  Hawk just made it make  go ahead  Steve Harvey's on 
[00:45:00]  the American Music Awards  right  and he does this  whole rant about  how radio  should be free  radio should be free  yeah  radio  that's exactly  how he's doing it  he's ranted  it should be  broadcast radio  should absolutely  be free  there you go  and people shouldn't  when you think of it  people shouldn't make  $25,000 or $30,000  to stand on stage  for an hour Steve  but they do  there's his head  you tell me that's  not a toupee  people  you know what else  shouldn't be done  if you want to go  what's right  people shouldn't make 
[00:45:30]  awful sitcoms Steve  yeah  but they do  don't they  that hair  that look at his  hairline is like  it was snapped  like a perfectly  snapped straight line  like they used  a laser level on it  that is  there's something  going on with that  hair  at least his teeth  are nice  that's something  going on  they're so white  and pearly  but I was laughing  at home  because they're just  going radio  should be free  they just don't get  what this satellite  radio is about yet  and it's not really  free  you have to sit  and listen to  commercials 
[00:46:00]  that's not free  which isn't really  free  you know  your time  you're not enjoying  the commercials  so now it's your time  and if you know  it's our time  right  we're listening to  commercials  but they are  scared shitless  of what satellite  radio is becoming  it's funny  they didn't mind  taking advertising  for it a few years  ago  they were taking  the advertising  dollars  yeah you don't  see that anymore  do you  yeah oops  we're going to  find the Steve  Harvey clip  because it's  really ridiculous  regular radio 
[00:46:30]  is starting to  sound ridiculous  at least their  plan is good  though  they have some  really good shows  lined up here in  New York  free FM  I think that  Logan should be  panicking  I will promote  the shit out of  free FM for them  because it's going  to blow  yeah  Chris in Delaware  yo yo yo  hi Chris  you guys what's  going on  hi babe  what's up  I was just  calling about that  whole free FM  deal it's horrible  yeah I know  what else did you  have we're going  back to is what  is happening  I'll tell you what  I just want to  let you guys know  I started recording 
[00:47:00]  it and I've been  calling every day  trying to get on  doing some assaults  with those guys  so as soon as I  get some I'll call  you guys back  well I just want  to know what's  going on with YSP  are they trashing  us or are they  not  one day Chris  is our friend  the next day  he's not  I've heard him  take Howard's  side and some  of this shit  then he's being  nice to us  what is it  kid Chris  from what I've  heard  make your statement  and go with it  you can't play it  both ways buddy  can't play it  both ways  from what I've  heard all it is  is they're 
[00:47:30]  making XM  and satellite radio  in general  sound like  absolute shit  and then making  Jimmy and  everybody that  has something  to do with  XM radio  like their  best friends  in order to  sell their  show  and you know  like I guess  they're sponsoring  Jimmy's show  and everything  like that  so I mean  it's just  you know  they're taking  they're totally  hypocritical  you know  they're using  someone  you know  they're using  Jimmy as  you know  a promotion  tool for their  free FM  and then  you know  they're trying  to slap you  in the dick  by you know  and they  did they really  hire Barski  over there  oh yeah 
[00:48:00]  dude Barski  got fired  five fucking years  ago  and he sucked  then  and he sucks  now  and  you know  dude  when free FM  is sponsoring  a show  let's get back  to that  it's important  that we support  that show  because it's a way  to support  satellite  alright  thank you Chris  guys thanks a lot  I don't know what  that means  could you get  your plug out  I don't need to  do it  it's not about me  the tower theater  New Year's Eve  is irrelevant  no one cares  alright  ticket master  I laugh at  here's what I say  to Norton show  I might as well 
[00:48:30]  do that on New Year's Eve  I care enough  that I'm going  Jimmy  I'll see you  on New Year's Eve  and I'm going to  point at you  and wave  great  like you do  every time  and I have to  stand up awkwardly  and go  hi I'm here  oh by the way  HBO is going to  get me a copy  of the first  fucking wave  you guys did  they want to see  in the second  really awful one  but there's a  first one too  apparently that was  worse for Ope  oh for Ope  yeah  which I've commissioned  and I went through  a lot of trouble  to get it  it will go up  on foundry  as soon as I  actually get it  let's say hi  I'm hired  Rudolph you're fired  remember Regis' thing 
[00:49:00]  so cute  very funny  I just wanted to say  those four people  in New York  they're so stranded  and they're so black  alright  very nice  so stranded  let's see  let's say hi  to Joe  in Brooklyn  very pissed off  Joe  what's going on  fellas  hi Joe  hi Jeff  hey listen Anthony  you know  I love you guys  to fuck the pieces  you guys are the greatest  but Anthony  what are you forgetting  about the blue column  and you forgot  you used to be  the working man  out there  yeah 
[00:49:30]  so you know  I mean  how do you not  what seems to be  the problem though  well what you're reading  and it is exactly  what you guys preach  and I agree  which is  the media  is full of  fucking shit  and all they do  is lies  so what you're reading  you believe  is necessarily true  that the MTA  was still bargaining  dude I'm not just reading  I'm listening  to what  both sides are saying  and I didn't hear  one time  the MTA  leaving that table  no 
[00:50:00]  wait wait wait  I'm telling you right now  trust me  I'm on bargaining  committees  with the union  in Brooklyn  that goes  well across  all over the northeast  but by any means  all it is  is the MTA  has to look good  in the eyes  of the public  when the union  decided to strike  so what do they say  well we stood there  we wanted to negotiate  but  the transit  the TW  decided to get up  and walk out  and why did they walk out  it was such a bad deal  that they said  fuck you  we're leaving  wait a second  you have to protect 
[00:50:30]  you have to protect  your new members  including your old members  the deal  now they gave them  the original deadline  was what  Monday night at midnight  they didn't walk  on Monday night at midnight  they said to them  we're gonna walk  they kept threatening  even the last couple  yeah threaten to walk  and it's  what everybody  that calls up  that's bitching  fails to remember  is  they're not allowed  it's illegal  for these people  to strike  okay  and that's understandable  but  and also  to actually 
[00:51:00]  to  to actually  wait  to go against  what you said  in reference to  how the national  is not supporting them  the national  legally  cannot publicly  say  that they're supporting it  because yes  it's an illegal  it's a wildcat strike  but  the national  knows very well  what was being done  can they support it  in public  no they can't  but they know  what was going on  this was not  they were not  at an impasse  they were far  from an impasse  where they had  to walk  off the job  they could have 
[00:51:30]  kept working  and kept at the table  because now  they are fucking  everybody over  you're talking about  me forgetting about  the blue collar worker  and shit  how many people  are being fucked  on a daily basis  just trying to get to work  wait a second  oh wait  so people are  inconvenienced  for what  inconvenience  no an inconvenience  is you missed  one train  and the next one  is coming in 10 minutes  that's inconvenience  this is a complete nightmare  you gotta admit that  this is not an inconvenience  it's a little more 
[00:52:00]  than that Joe  Joe you were a union rep  somewhere  absolutely  in Brooklyn  why do I think  that his union repping  involved a fucking  a walk into like  maybe an alley  with a bat attached  to it  a bat  why do I think  there was not  gentle negotiation  my stepfather Sal  was a union rep  you know  please I was in  a fucking union dude  I was in fucking  the tin knockers union  I know you are  I remember that  back in the day  you always talk about that  but also I'm saying  you're saying that  these guys should have  worked without a contract  if we  you know  if any worker  works without a contract  especially in this  fucking city 
[00:52:30]  they get walked upon  all over  look what happened  to the teachers union  this city walked  all over them  they were fucking  miserable  they walked all over them  yes they can't strike  but  if they work without a contract  they're in trouble  the teachers union  went how many years  without a contract  many years  but there are certain jobs  that you get perks  which are  some pay perks  I mean  the transit  they're making a lot of money  they're making good  fucking money  you think that 50 or 60 thousand  is a lot of money  in this day and age  it's got 
[00:53:00]  43 grand  starting salary  that ain't bad  my friend  it's not bad  that ain't bad  it's not bad  but it's not like  you know  standing on oil  the way you're making it out  well what the fuck  do you want  then go to fucking school  and get a better job  this is  it's all in line  with what you're doing  you drive a bus  you drive a train  here's what you fucking make  the guy that  you know  invents something  for IBM  he makes a little more  this guy makes a little less  it all falls in line  for some reason 
[00:53:30]  it looks to me like  the transit union  wants  everything they're asking for  which is above and beyond  what  really comparable jobs  are getting  I can't see them  wanting everything  that they're asking for  what they're doing right now  is  it's a bartering tool  if the MTA  this isn't a bartering tool  it's extortion  it's like saying  holding a gun to someone's head  is a bartering tool  to get some money out of them  they're  they're holding the city  hostage  but they gave them  how many opportunities  did they sit there 
[00:54:00]  and say  it doesn't matter  it's illegal  everything you're saying  even if it  there were valid points  doesn't matter  because the strike  is illegal  they're not allowed  to fucking walk  off the job  they should be  fired  and either  the National Guard  or someone  should be brought in  to run the trains  and the fucking  buses  until other people  are trained  and then show  these guys  what real hardship  is like  now you got  no fucking  health benefits  you got no  fucking paycheck  because you were  a fucking asshole 
[00:54:30]  and you followed  that idiot  that publicity  hound  jerk off  who is fucking  these guys' lives over  the media  put a total  fucking spin  on it  and did exactly  what they wanted  and it created  everybody to fucking  believe  their key word  over here  is it's illegal  it's illegal  so what  they fucking  did a wildcat strike  they need a fucking  contract  they gave them  ample opportunities  the last contract  they were supposed  to walk  and everybody  was in a frenzy  and they never walked  they continued to work 
[00:55:00]  and even still  man there are just  two sides  that aren't going  to agree on that  my question is this  even though the strike's  illegal  I mean it's not like  they're cops or firemen  I mean I know  it's a bad strike  but if you're not  allowed to strike  and this isn't any job  what is your main  bargaining tool  if you're not  permitted to strike  and I know they get perks  and they know that  when they go into the job  I'm just kind of asking  what is the main  thing you can say  well do it  or else what  we're just going to  keep asking  if you're not allowed  to strike  how do you get  what you want  good point Jimmy  good point  you have to take  a stance 
[00:55:30]  and unfortunately  it had to come down  to yes  they had to walk  but that is  their only major  bargaining asset  that they had  that they could  even if they had  to walk  it wasn't to the point  where they had  to fucking walk  it was not  at the point yet  that they had  to fucking walk  even the MTA  is saying  and you can say  they're lying  they're this  that  they were at  the table  they were the ones  at the fucking table  this guy  this guy  is a publicity 
[00:56:00]  hound  he loves  he loves  the attention  you believe that  he can't even  abso-fucking-lutely  he can't even  speak English  yeah no shit  MTA  alright Joe  thank you  bye Joe  bye bye bye  he's destroying  a lot of these  workers lives  depending on  how long this goes  these guys  are being fined  they're being docked  two days pay  for every day  they miss  you know how long  that's going to  take them to catch up  a million dollars  a day  the union  is being fined  they have something  like three million bucks 
[00:56:30]  that they have  in their treasury  it's going to be gone  in a couple of days  now they're talking  about fining  individual workers  these poor sons of bitches  that are now  on the  picket lines  are going to be  fined  they're going to have  to pay out money  above and beyond  what they're being docked  just go the fuck  back to work  get to work  Ellis and Philly  what's up  morning guys  morning  in general  in Philly 
[00:57:00]  on that YSP  they're just  sore with  satellite in general  it has nothing  to do with  ONA directly  or any other  particular show  and you know  to prove it  they still have  your wow stickers  up in the bathroom  over there  where they've been  since you guys  were on YSP  and that means what  I'm proud  that our stickers  are in the bathroom  wouldn't they take it down  if they were talking  a bunch of crap  wouldn't there be  something written on it  oh great  so a hundred people  have seen our wow stickers  in the last year  that's wonderful  we don't think they hate  we don't think they hate  the ONA show do  we just want to make sure 
[00:57:30]  nothing bad was said  by a guy that we like  it's like people  trash in the business  it's a part of what we do  and we know that  guys in Florida  talk a lot of shit  about this show  we don't know them  when you hear it  somebody that you know  and you're friends with  it's like shit  it really does  fuck I hope that's not true  something went on  on the Kid Chris show  and we assumed  he was sort of a friend  of the show  and we're just trying  to get to the bottom of it  and in fairness to him  I did talk to him  and he did say absolutely no  and he did email me  and goes dude  it didn't happen  so if there was a tape  of anything different  fine please send it 
[00:58:00]  but according to him  he did not do anything  supposedly some guy  on the show  that has an annoying laugh  took some nice shots  especially at you  at me right  yeah not Chris himself  but somebody on the show  thank you Ellis  alright man you guys suck  bye fella  let's watch the language  hey we got the Steve Harvey  thing he did  oh we do  we have a good staff here  by the way  amazing  what was that sour look  you gave me Hawk  what's the matter  you're all down today  dude these guys  they didn't even go home  but no he's down today  he slept an hour right  when he's wearing his glasses  that means he hasn't slept  when I came in here 
[00:58:30]  it's like a flop house  this place is like a flop house  why don't you go home  just hop up  he was sleeping on the couch  outside the studio right  yeah  and then who else slept over  last night  Travis slept here last night  who was on the couch  Danny  Travis and Danny  Danny had his face  stuck to the leather couch  it's like the couch sucks  you just sweat on it  it's a leather like  friggin lawyer office couch  and he's sleeping on it  and he gets up  you hear  when he rips his face 
[00:59:00]  off of the side of it  you know that webcam  you got set up now  yeah  you gotta keep it running  24 hours a day  cause I have a feeling  there's some crazy shit  going on around here  when we're not here  yeah who knows  someone's getting their dick sucked  by one of the other guys  I know who it is  I don't know who it is  Danny I didn't know  who it was  so I walk in here  now I'm like  ridiculous early  when I walked in here  and I see the office  the shades are down  and the door is shut  and I'm like  I've never been here first  so perhaps this is the way  they close up shop  I open the door 
[00:59:30]  and I just see somebody  sleeping on the couch  I'm like  now I can't turn the TV on  I can't get on my computer  so I hang my jacket up  and slowly tiptoe out  and shut the door  it's a fucking hotel  it's a bed and breakfast  I thought Steve was the first one  cause he has  no problem about  just running in  and turning lights on  and making noise  Master Poe was asleep here  yes Poe slept on the Liberator  we got pictures of  Master Poe sleeping  and Travis sleeping  up on opianthony.com  cause I came in early  Master Poe takes his shoes 
[01:00:00]  and socks off  ew  he might have to get into  a kickboxing match  at the moment's notice Opie  yeah well the pictures  are up on opianthony.com  the guy's using the place  as a flop house  cause I got in  so Master Poe slept here  last night too  on the Liberator  that homeless Donna used  Travis sleeps in the fetal position  that's hilarious  yeah  of course he does  he's a little guy  all safe and curled up  like he's in a little womb  no wrists  just an umbilical cord  look at him  he's protecting himself  from danger 
[01:00:30]  protecting himself  from bad dreams  what a little douche  where is he  he's over there  was there a little nightlight  plugged into the socket  next to him  of course there is  prevents tripping  in the evening  when you're going to piddle  unbelievable  fucking sissy  stretch your legs out  unbelievable  so I'm sitting here  for I don't know  a half hour  45 minutes  and uh  Poe  wiping sleepies  out of his eyes  is like  uh  what time did you get here  I was like  oh I've been here  for a while  I have to come in  before the uh  the HOV thing 
[01:01:00]  uh kicks in  oh  and I think he was  a little disappointed  in himself  that he wasn't  waiting downstairs  yeah  uh  and I showed up  so early  yeah  uh  but the uh  I gotta thank  our EMT friends  they were out there  this morning  and um  I pulled up  and uh  they followed me  to the garage  and gave me  the uh  the ride back  those guys  I know  they're big fans  but they're a little  strange  all of a sudden  they're just  kind of waiting  outside the studio  that's cool  they're just  cruising around  they just like  sit there  and wait for us  to ride  and just kind of  wave at us  and then you  wave awkwardly 
[01:01:30]  back  you don't go  to the window  and have a chat  every once in a while  I chit chat  every once in a while  but they gave you  a ride to the garage  yeah  give me a ride  that was nice  it's good  because uh  if any uh  lights come up  uh  that might uh  delay me  I think you go  right through them  alright here's uh  Steve Harvey  we were talking  about this earlier  as well  listen to this  hey I just want  to start by saying  I want to thank  everybody for listening  to the Steve Harvey  morning show  in the morning  appreciate that  in the morning  thank you much  right on  and I'd like to  thank everybody  for uh  buying my album  Wreck of the Day  and helping it 
[01:02:00]  go gold  now uh  the key word  is buying her albums  you're supposed  to buy albums  buy CDs  none of that  illegal downloading  you will go  to prison  you're going to  way to start  a cause  Steve  wow  way to start  a cause  kind of how to  call people to arms  the reality is  they've pretty much  taken care of the  uh  go to prison  illegal downloading  thing  they really have 
[01:02:30]  all the record  industry wanted  was to take  that percentage  that was massive  and get it way  way down  to a manageable  level  that's all  they were trying  to do  they knew  they couldn't  stop illegal  downloading  totally  but they didn't  want 75%  let's say  of the people  out there  getting their  music for free  they were like  they were  they figured  out a percentage  like well  if we could  get it down  to 10  or whatever  I don't have  the exact numbers  then we're okay  that's all  they were trying  to do  and they've  succeeded  with that  it's a lot  harder to  download all  your music  and I know  people are going to  call and say  I'm still doing it 
[01:03:00]  but as far as  the masses  they're just not  doing it  it's not as big  as it was  when Napster  was free  and huge  so for him  to jump on  that bandwagon  it's like  what  wow Steve  wow way to  go out on a limp  go to prison  it continues  you're going  to jail  all of you  you'll be  somebody's  girlfriend  before you  know it  remember  buy albums  radio should  be free  buy albums  radio  should be 
[01:03:30]  free  that's the deal  so  what about  satellites  no don't  worry about  satellites  we don't  make money  on that  you just  don't  roll these  clips  you tripping  wow  that was  pretty funny  at least  he kind of  acknowledged  what it was  saying we don't  make money  on that  that was  funny  what I'm  saying is  at least  he said  look we don't  make money  on satellites  but whoever  that broad  was  I don't  think that  was in  the cute  script  so she was  like well  what about  satellites  she knows  satellites  huge  and that's  when he  had to  say  let's 
[01:04:00]  not worry  about that  I don't  make money  off that  he should  have punched  her in the  face  and then demand  an extra five bucks  she went into another  boring woman's zone  and no women I don't hate you  every time I tease women  I get in emails  well you don't love women  I love women  right  radio should be free  keep using that slogan  commercial radio  we're gonna kill you  we're gonna absolutely  kill you  it should be  shit should be free  work on your content  work on your content  and work on your commercial loads  stop with this radio  should be free  shit  you're gonna lose  badly  and stop buckling  to the FCC  because they gave

[01:14:00]  it is  could take calls  you know the Yankees  seem to need some pitching  Jimmy  I don't fucking stink  they're signing up names  that are a little  controversial to the Yankees  being he was a Red Sox  and I believe  they are just doing  out to put some answers  in the seats there  Mikey  Johnny Damon is good  if you want to  turn him around  and stick your dick  in him  and rub his long locks  that's what he's good for  if you want to  fuck a center fielder  in the dumper  Johnny Damon's perfect  cause you can pull his  pull his little hair  you know what  you really do need  a sports talk show 
[01:14:30]  I know I do  I'm very good  it's brilliant stuff  dude I get right  to the heart of the issue  the Yankees just  beat down the Red Sox  time and time again  I know the Red Sox  won the World Series  but they're slowly  but surely  forgetting about that already  the Yankees goal  is to  New York's goal  really is to pick apart  their championship team  just a little  pick pick pick  but don't pick the pitchers  don't get Schilling  or Pedro  don't take any of the pitchers  take Johnny Damon  everyone knows  pitchers win World Series  of course they do  in the end 
[01:15:00]  but uh  don't get that monster  David Ortiz  David Ortiz  would have been uh  Yankee Stadium  yeah  oof  yeah well  Johnny Damon  is now a New York Yankee  yeah  one of the big stories  and they shouldn't let him  keep his stupid long hair  they won't  that's his thing  that's not a Yankee thing  they all should be  have pilot haircuts  you know  that meh  right up the back  they all should have  the Roger Maris  that's right  something uh  something that looks 
[01:15:30]  like you were in the Marines  should have run around  like a bunch of fags  right  you know he's gonna look  completely silly  with short hair  and no beard  yeah  that's why he's got  the long hair  and the beard  dude I hope he bats 180  he's hiding something man  that's gonna come out  I hope he bats 180  half a Hulk center fielder  he's probably got a big tumor  on the side of his head  that he's been covering up  with that long hair  there's gonna be a world  of hurt under that hair  now uh  we were talking  during uh break  about uh  do you think he's gonna  be well received  when they play a game  in in Fenway 
[01:16:00]  and I tend to think  he's not  Ben is like  nah dude  you know  they really love him  in Boston  I think the more  you'd love a player  the worse it is  when they come back  to that city  in a hated uniform  absolutely  when uh  Clemens came back  in a Yankee uniform  and Clemens was adored  in Boston  uh  he was booed  now it's a different story  because he's you know  whored himself out  to a few different teams  but they did turn around  when Clemens went back  to pitch for the last time  in Boston 
[01:16:30]  I remember  yeah yeah  a great uh  reaction  yeah but I think  the first time  first time  Johnny Damon is introduced  as a New York Yankee  you're just gonna hear  boos  in Boston  hell yeah  yeah  there you go  well  baseball talk  is alive and well  on XM175  home plate  is discussing  Johnny Damon  right now  I think  yeah we shouldn't  uh  hone in on their  their turf  Jimmy  what's wrong  could it be something  in the sporting section 
[01:17:00]  or I can't really see  what he's looking at  is that the entertainment  uh  entertainment section  perhaps  I want to share  I don't know what page  he's on  he's laughing  so  paper  maybe page six  I  I  what the  I'm having to take a look  where are you Jimmy  give us a  the daily news  I'm reading  the funny papers  oh the funny papers  oh the funny papers  alright let's get  to the funny papers  he's reading the funny papers  Jimmy loves the funny papers  oh  he's the last person 
[01:17:30]  in America  that actually  reads the funny papers  they're so appropriately  named  funny papers  alright where are you Jimmy  Marmaduke  Marmaduke  you know Jimmy  loves Marmaduke  where's Marmaduke  what page are you on Jimmy  oh page  even the page number  is hysterically funny  page 62  62  where are you  oh here we go  Marmaduke  okay  in this one  there's uh  there's uh 
[01:18:00]  the Christmas gift shop  and there's like  little trees in the window  and there's a woman  standing in front of the door  apparently an employee  and she's got her arms  stretched out  and she's blocking the door  and Marmaduke  Marmaduke  is pulling his owner  towards the shop doors  and she's  she's saying  she's saying 
[01:18:30]  never  that's funny  yeah that's funny  she won't let him in the store  won't let him in the store  cause he's a dog  and he's big  and he's getting misbehaved  oh  that's terrific  like a bull in a china shop  yeah  Marmaduke's so big 
[01:19:00]  you know  alright  alright well  hey what's the next big event  for the Opie and Anthony show  next big event  I believe it's  this weekend  let me think  couple things are gonna go on  Friday  this weekend  uh oh  Friday we're replaying  the homeless shopping spree  in case you missed it  it was great  it was a great show yesterday  and then uh  the last two weekends  of 2005  of course  the first one starts  Friday at midnight  and then the following weekend 
[01:19:30]  Friday at midnight  uh  the last two weekends  of 2005  we're running the best bits  of ONA  since coming to  XM Satellite Radio  ah  some of the categories  being featured are  best moments of Opie and Anthony  uh  best little Jimmy outburst  best show cringe moment  best Steve from Yellowstone  best Ramon promo  best Drew Boogie remix  and a lot more  and then what  we're gonna count down  the best bits right  according to the listeners  as well  so if you're a new fan  of the Opie and Anthony show  you're just getting 
[01:20:00]  the ONA virus  you can play a little  catch up uh  the next two weekends  I think they're  12 hour shows right  yeah  wow  it's a 12 hour  uh best of show  I'd call that  an extravaganza  that's a marathon  just the best bits  we've done  since coming to  Satellite Radio  it starts Friday  at midnight  it'll go from  Saturday and Sunday  and then we're gonna do it  the following week  weekend as well  there's 12 hours  of good bits  12 hours of great bits  wow  it's a great way  for the new listeners  to catch up  so uh  spread the virus  on that 
[01:20:30]  and let people know  that we're doing this  very long intros  in between each one  I wonder  because I know  usually when we do  uh  when we do best of  things like that  me and Opie  toil  toil  that's right  and Jimmy  toil  in the studio  here  uh  introing them  that's right  you remember  you might have heard  something like  oh I remember  this one  don't you Opie  yeah this was when  blah blah blah  blah blah  and then Jimmy  pulls his pants down  and farts in the mic 
[01:21:00]  everyone lops  into the bit  that's right  uh  I  I don't remember  uh  recording any of those  this time around though  we really didn't want to  put in any extra  uh  effort  so we  good I like that  we decided that the guys  should be introing the bits  and by the guys  E-Rock  and Danny  and Nathaniel  Travis  did uh  Derek do any  fuck no  Derek did nothing  I love Derek  Derek is going to go  so far in radio  he knows  how to do 
[01:21:30]  as little work  as possible  and get the most  out of it  I love all these guys  because they all have  their special  personality  personality  works  Derek doesn't want  to be involved  on air at all  he barely talks  on the show  no  and then you got  the rest of the guys  that can't get  enough air time  you got  don't take any  chances  Travis  Danny  who will do  anything  that's right  Danny's like  the go to guy  Nathaniel with his  dry sarcasm  dry sarcastic 
[01:22:00]  I gotta  be here  kind of wit  he's getting  rave reviews  I'm just here  until something  better comes along  he's getting  rave reviews  on his  homeless shopping  spree  oh I thought  you were going  to say  on his  Avis commercial  no  man we gotta  talk about  that other  audition  you did  Nathaniel  he did another  audition  oh yes  he did  that we won't  hear a word  about  I got some  dirt on Nathaniel  but supposedly  we're not allowed  to talk about it  of course we're not  can we talk  about it yet  no  that is the 
[01:22:30]  I guess that  that is the  dick move  that happens  the most  in this studio  the overzealous  guy from the room  comes in to grab  the mic  to be on mic  and pulls the  boom right out  of the console  it's cause he's  like 6'8  I've seen  Danny do it  I've seen  Travis do it  everyone does it  it's the over eager  I have to get to  the mic as quickly  as possible  and pull it  right out  of the console  afraid of the  dead air  like if you  actually lifted  it at a human  pace  when the mic 
[01:23:00]  got up to the lips  that dead air  would lose  something  well you know  it is tough  to get a word  in edgewise  sometimes  you get excited  that is true  alright so what  what went on  here  with  sorry  the intros  to the bits  well  for this special  we're doing  we were all  four of us  gonna sit down  and do them  together  and you know  just hopefully  some funny things  could happen  if we were all  in studio together  oh when you guys  are all in studio  it's magic  just waiting 
[01:23:30]  to be laid down  in some digital  format  yes  well it's at least  more likely  than if it's just  us sitting by  ourselves  true  alright  so because of  some scheduling  things  E-Rock  chose to do  his by himself  Eric why  and by scheduling  you mean  hatred of each other  I don't know  Eric  thank you  no we all  had different  schedules  I had to do  mine at a  different time  than they 
[01:24:00]  do it  do you feel  isolated from  the guys  no  why not  in order to  be isolated  don't you have  to be part  of something  to be isolated  from it  Carrie was  isolated  she was never  a part of  she was never  a part of  I want to go  on record  and say  I like  the E-Rock  I love E-Rock  versus ass  off for this  show  and these guys  just beat  them up  everyone  works hard  I know  everyone works  hard  these guys  poor hawk  he's like  he's like  he's always  twinging over  there just  afraid that  he's going  to get an  elbow  are you coming  to our  Christmas  dinner 
[01:24:30]  no  why  he's not  invited  yeah well  that one  no you're  cordially invited  I am extending  to you an invitation  what the hell is going on  with this Christmas  dinner of yours  it's turned into  something ridiculous  it was going to be  little  it was going to be  little  fucking  fat head  Pat from  Munaki  and  I was going to  take him out  for Christmas  because he had  such a pathetic  life story  and had no one  to hang out with  for Christmas  now it's turning  into this  gigantic 
[01:25:00]  gala event  dude please  please tell him  to meet you  somewhere  and don't  show up  please do that  now that would  be good  what a Christmas  gag  are you going  Jimmy  yes  wink  yes wink  yeah I'm gonna go  E-Rock you gonna go  oh no E-Rock's  going to Florida  right  yeah I won't be  he leaves tomorrow  oh  alright so let's get  to the bottom of this  so what happened  so he did his  intros  yeah and so  we wanted to  we came in later  and we wanted to  know how his  sounded  to see if we  had a certain 
[01:25:30]  angle to take  whatever  now you hadn't  recorded anything  yet  no  so you see  what E-Rock  does and maybe  work off of that  so there's kind  of a common  thread going  through the whole  thing  yes  alright  and make sure  you know  if he's calling  something something  we keep  you know  consistent  right  but  continuity  exactly  but so  when we first  played them  something else  struck us  about them  uh huh  um  I guess the first  word is  exuberance  it comes to  mind  exuberance 
[01:26:00]  well that  in itself  isn't a bad  thing  no  I think we  would like  exuberance  here on the  show  it's something  you want  uh  presenting some  best of  you want a  little exuberance  people to be  excited about  what they're  going to hear  we're trying to  break E-Rock  of his old  habits  because uh  E-Rock  you have done  radio  you've done  your own  radio show  yeah let's  give a little  history about  E-Rock  before this  he had done  radio  had he done  radio like  the O.B.  Anthony show  no  no  where you just  go on the air  and use your  real voice  no 
[01:26:30]  where you  just do  your real  voice  he had  been involved  what a strange  concept  but most radio  guys still  don't understand  that one  go to your  top 40  station  that's right  the puker  listen to the  jocks  listen to your  morning show  on your top  40 station  that's where  E-Rock  worked  so now  I guess  this all came  flooding back  to you  uh  during  the time  that you were  recording these  intros and stuff  for the best of  yeah 
[01:27:00]  it did  it did  it did  come pouring  back  it was like a  flashback to  that  E-Rock  you might want  to take the  next half  E-Rock  you might want  to go take a  very long coffee  not even for  yourself  we'll be  uncomfortable  looking at you  during this  so you were  kind of goofing  off doing this  no he didn't  don't try to  turn it around  no I'm not  trying to turn it  the one thing  I protect  you but don't  even attempt to  say that you were  trying to like  hack it up on  purpose  no I wasn't 
[01:27:30]  trying to  hack it up  I was just  trying not to  sound like  this  very dull  but that's  another reason  why it was  better to do  together  because then  you just  sort of  naturally  are trying  to be  entertaining  because you're  talking to  somebody else  yeah  instead of  you know  alright well  we got  audio of  E-Rock  oh boy  oh boy  I'm sure  it's good  here's the  intro to the  big end of  your Opie and  Anthony special  that's going to  start airing  Friday at  midnight  does it start  with this  yeah  you might  think he's  putting on a  wacky voice  by the way 
[01:28:00]  I heard that  you re-recorded  these  now I want  these played  during the  special  yep  because now  everyone's going  to want to  listen just to  hear you know  you intro on  some of these  bits  and now I'm just  seeing the extra  hours logging in  his eyes  having to reassemble  some of these  things  why would you  redo it  I was advised  that it was not  Danny  did you hear that  he goes if only  he'd gotten to  work on them  on time  well the truth  you wouldn't be  running sprinting 
[01:28:30]  last minute  to get it done  if it was done  when it was  supposed to be  done  when it was  a one person  job  now that it's  four people  it took a  long  who made it  a one person  job  who made it  a four person  job because  the one person  couldn't get it  done as a  one person  it's a playground  and E-Rock  is the kid  just getting  fucking beat up  look at Ben  Ben just  opened the door  to giggle  pointed  giggled  and left  I hope they  caught that  on the cam  please tell me  you people  saw that  he opened the  door  and walked  away 
[01:29:00]  that's the  executive producer  of the open  anthony show  that's what Ben  does  this is such  a fucking  mess man  oh my god  so wait a minute  now  Hawk was doing  what were you  doing Eric  that you were  doing it by  yourself  yeah I was  doing it by  myself  I was waiting  for all the  listeners to vote  it was a bigger  job than I  thought I  could handle  alright I got  the original  voice tracks  I want to  hear how you  replaced these  because I bet  you they're not  much different  no they are  different  alright well  we can hear the  old one or the  new one first  this is the  original one 
[01:29:30]  but then all of a sudden  everyone started  talking and he  got wind of it  so he changed it  up but this is  how it was going  to be  do we have the  new ones too  oh yeah  I think the  new ones just  go fuck Danny  own his best  bits  and that's it  alright without  further ado here's  E-Rock's enthusiastic  voice tracks for the  big Opie and Anthony  end of year special  now remember we've  we've kind of goofed  on voices like this  that's right  this is not a goof 
[01:30:00]  yes it is this is  E-Rock along with  Danny Nathaniel and  Travis taking you  through 12 hours of  the best of Opie and  Anthony since coming to  XM Satellite Radio  we've got segments of  Opie losing his mind  Anthony freaking out  little Jimmy outbursts  Steve from Yellowstone  calls Ramon promos  Drew boogie remixes  in studio guests  ONA freaks  overall show segments  listener submissions  and a whole lot more  let's start things off  with a selection from  our first category  best show opener  on the best of Opie and  Anthony  holy crap 
[01:30:30]  we can't even look at  him  dude you sound 15  what happened  I can't even look at  you  I think this place  is restricted  hey that isn't  nice  alright  he stinks  and I don't like  him  well you're very  excited  yeah  he stinks  and I don't like  him  Opie and Anthony  where's up  hello exactly  and then these guys  are such ball  busters  yeah  Travis decided to 
[01:31:00]  imitate  E-Rock  here's Travis  taking a chance  for once  hey it's the best of  Opie and Anthony  I'm E-Rock  and this is  stalker Patty  make a deal  now Patty brought us  in some Christmas  presents last year  that the boys  didn't really like  so we sold them  on ebay  and we promised her  that we'd give her  the money  but we made her do  a couple wacky  things  before she got it  check it out  and I'll be back  with part two  right after this  you asshole 
[01:31:30]  I love it  now I want  the whole special  to have these  wacky voices  there was also  a track where  Travis referenced  me sounding like  Opie back at  BAB  he said if you  want to hear  Opie at BAB  listen to Eric's  next track  or something  oh really  with the high voice  where's that  I can burn that  real quick  alright yeah  go get that  Eric when you  were doing that  I've never done  that before  what are you  thinking when  you're doing that  I gotta get this  right  are you going  this sounds like  normal  I'm not even 
[01:32:00]  fucking with you  I'm honestly  I'm not even  fucking with you  he wants to know  where the wacky  voice comes from  what was your  motivation  you came from  a different radio  school than I did  did you instantly  do that  or did your first  take  was it like  hey  you know  your normal voice  then you go  I think I need  a little more  if I try to  sound excited  it comes out  like that  it sounds really  dumb  so it gets  all high pitch  and energy  and  well we got  another example  why don't we  listen to this  E-Rock's voice 
[01:32:30]  tracks  for the big  Opie and Anthony  end of year special  it is the best  of Opie and Anthony  since coming to  XM Satellite Radio  it's the infamous  Booger Couch  to recap  Anthony had some  family over  and some of that  family happened  to be young kids  well Anthony  discovers that  one of the young  kids  wipes a booger  somewhere on  Anthony's couch  being the germaphobe  that he is  Anthony loses his  mind and must  get rid of the  couch completely  here it is  Booger Couch  on the best  of Opie and Anthony  told the whole  thing  exactly  well I don't

[01:35:00]  this  it's  the  cleft  palate  segment  on the  best  of  opium  anthony  since  coming  to  XM  satellite  radio  I forgot  all about  that bit  by the  way  I think  too much  information  is being  given  maybe  leave a  little  mystery  a guy  called  and he  had a  certain  affliction  that  jimmy  picked  up  on  let's  go to  that  clip  right  now  I don't  like  the fact  that he's  saying  since  coming  to  XM  satellite  radio  yeah  a little  gap  there  he's  pausing  dramatic  pause  for you  does he  hum  a little 
[01:35:30]  XM  jingle  at the  end  Travis  what did  you just  hand me  this is  just  one of  the  actual  ones  that  three  of us  did  and I  think  Eric  wanted  to  smash  me  because  I  mentioned  how  he  sounds  like  you  and  old  BAB  tapes  but  I  don't  think  it's  really  going  to  work  Hawk  did  you  want  to  smash  me  I  don't  know  why  he  wants  to  play  this  but  again  let me  just  point  out  I  love  pointing  this  out  Travis 
[01:36:00]  play  this  now  he  mentioned  it  he  wanted  me  to  exactly  now  the  blame  is  squarely  over  there  if  this  tanks  oh wait  a minute  you know  what  god damn  it  that was  a good  pick up  Travis  wasn't sure  if it was  a good  response  so he  automatically  lobbed it  back  into his  atrocious  court  this happens  amongst these  guys  all the  time  it's  like  where  did  this  clip  come  from  I  don't  know  Steve  brought  it  in  and  no  one  commits

[01:39:30]  you gave  exactly the  information you gave  in comedic  style  it like  sometimes the  payoff is the  fact that you're  listening going  what does this  monster rain mean  and then when  jimmy finally says  it you're like  oh my goodness  that's shocking  there's no shock  to it when you  and this special is  for the people that  don't know about  these bits  the whole reason  we're doing this  huge special  the best bits  since coming to  xm satellite radio  is for all the new  people that have  jumped aboard in the  last few months 
[01:40:00]  you can't really  get on his case  i mean it's not  like he's been  in radio for the  last 10 12  15 years  oh danny man  that was a bit  sarcastic down  wow  he is a willful  young boy  rather naughty  john in pennsylvania  hey a jew walks  into a bar  because he owned it  john  oh these guys  suck  why don't you  just go ahead  and let uh  a big a  and switzels  record these  intros  oh yeah  you're not  thinking  not a bad idea  we should have  had big a  well there's

[01:43:30]  story about  his interaction  with jerry  seinfeld  and seinfeld  had two  words to say  to him  that broke  his little  heart  it's hilarious  t-rock  you should have  told the  whole story  that would have  been a perfect  t-rock  if you said  this is the  time when  bob kelly  ran into  seinfeld  and thought  seinfeld  was talking  to him  and seinfeld  said not  you  i actually  wanted to  use these  though so  even though  the parodies  still use  them so i  didn't want  to actually

[01:56:30]  a fast moving  brush  oh yeah  he got on that  bus just in time  and ben was  obsessed about it  this morning  he was so bummed  that e-rock  got back on that  bus  hot off the  wire  hot off the  ap  e-rock  just signed  50 million dollar  deal with  sirius satellite  unbelievable  they pick up  all the talent  over there  pay them  tons of money  all right  i want to 
[01:57:00]  but no  he's  he's only slept  an hour  he's slept on  a couch  my question is  we see you guys  being brutal  to eric here  but we don't see  eric being brutal  back  is eric brutal  back or no  no he's a big  pussy  oh one day  one day  it's gonna be  everyone pays  like columbine style  yeah he really is  a kipling kinko  i'm just gonna  murder all of you  i'm not gonna  spare one life  we  but uh he took  the heat on the  balls more than  the guys thought  he could  you don't look  so bad  hawk what is 
[01:57:30]  the tension  with you and the  guys  i like you  we all like you  yeah  they like fucking  with me but i  don't do that  back to them  no  why  they just don't  why do they  fuck with you  you're a good  guy  cause they can  do we have  another show  we could do  i mean what's  what's what  there's nothing  wrong with you  at all  danny put that  away  what is that  what is that  danny  huh  you brought  it out  now it's out  wait what do you  got in your  pocket  yes and he  said put it  away  yeah  put it  away  what do you  got  what do you  guys keep  track of  eric let me 
[01:58:00]  give you a  little um  give you a  little lesson  here  you should now  jump on the  pile  cause apparently  to me it  looked like you  pulled something  out  was that against  eric or  nathaniel  well i had a  feeling that the  question was  going to come  up like why  do we smash  eric all the  time so i  just compiled  some specifics  so danny  opened a  microsoft word  document  oh jeez  oh no  uh oh  let me see  that  see this is  what they  do they  they obsess  with photos  of me or  everything that 
[01:58:30]  i do but i  don't pay  attention to  what they  do  or you  could call  it show  prep  cause we  knew we  were going  to slam  you today  wow  this is  title  the title  alone  is this  real  it's an  homage  to  it's a  one thousand  reasons to  hate eric  that's an  homage to  the run of  fesbit  right  all worst  of duties  yeah it was  just really  you know  thought starters  yeah so  you know when  you guys said  well why  is this you 
[01:59:00]  know this  animosity  towards eric  you know you  could just  look at it  and say ah  yes now i'm  not flustered  and just run  with it so  time management  best bits  last vacation  post show  stuff  nothing would  get finished  if we didn't  take it  out of his  hands  what happened  to what did  i learn for  the year  question mark  question mark  question mark  constant lies  deleting bits  scratch and  match  oh fuck  you  that was  not up 
[01:59:30]  eric  oh wait a  minute  wait a minute  that one got  there  all right  yeah  i gotta figure  this whole  thing out  these guys  are still  convinced  that eric  it was  a show  everyone  over  no it  wasn't  you dumb  shit  all right  when have  you ever  brought up  paper in  from home  here's where  the hatred  comes from  i had it  in my back  here's where  the hatred  comes from  because i knew  that you know  eric had to be  something behind  eric wasn't  their favorites  but they're so  obsessed i'm like  there had to be  something that got 
[02:00:00]  this going  because all this  other stuff you  mentioned is like  whatever  what other stuff is  on the list  um last one  into work  consistently  credit whoring  we after  everything i did  after oh i did  everything  yeah that's it  sorry credit  whoring we  after i did  everything  uh just  distracting the  flow  yeah like you  know by having  just things that  he probably  shouldn't have up  in the first place  just uh 
[02:00:30]  okay  uh aim  slash live  reads  yeah eric  well eric  i guess he  kind of forgets  that we do  a show every  day and you  kind of have  to remind him  to put his  instant messenger  on consistently  at 702  hey your  instant messenger  is not on  i think you're  a little dyslexic  it's more like  720 is when  you finally sign  on  uh looking at  wrestling websites  during the show  when have i done  that  this is brutal  but wait  eric  i gotta go  the scratching 
[02:01:00]  yeah we're gonna  move backwards  i just wanted  to see what else  was on that list  uh bad breath  that was what  ben said  ben put that on  by the way  and then after all  this and this  isn't even the  last one  inability to  take a joke  after just a  slamming  that's like  someone being in  a vietnamese  like concentration  camp  a pow camp  and and  after a  beatings for  years going  you cannot  take a joke  drop ice water  on your forehead  for like  six straight 
[02:01:30]  months  and then go  look he can't  take uh  the water  drop it on  his forehead  another inability  you rape a  chick you know  inability to  show intimacy  inability to  take responsibility  name dropping  on telephone  for no reason  that's my  favorite  it's op  slash don  yeah this is  my favorite  thing that  that eric  likes to do  like if he  called  like let's  say his  roommate  called him  on a  cell phone  he wouldn't  stop to  tell you  that his  roommate  just  called  but if 
[02:02:00]  it's don  or op  he has to  tell you  he'll pick  up the phone  and he'll go  hello  and he'll go  it's opie  you know  cause he has to  let you know  he has to  let you know  it's don  I was waiting  and last but not  least on this  list here 
[02:02:30]  tries to be  superman  fails miserably  what does that  mean  just as you know  I want to take the  helm and I want to  get everything done  by myself  so everybody can  see what a big boy  I am  and then  it just never  happens  I am stunned  over here  but now let's go  back to  constant lies  deleting bits  and then  the biggie  scratch and match  and that's where  this all began  is that bit  this thing was  this thing was  bubbling under the  surface  you know 
[02:03:00]  without a doubt  but then it was  the scratch and  match that  put this over the  top  here's what  happened quickly  New York City  paper  I believe  with Daily News  yeah  yeah Daily News  was doing something  called scratch and  match  you'd open up  the paper  and this game  card would fall  out every fucking  day  you'd scratch it  and if you  matched a few  numbers  you were a  winner  you could win a  cash prize of  differing  different amounts  one day  they had a  misprint on  their scratch and  match tickets  where a shitload  of people won  $100,000 
[02:03:30]  $50,000  and Daily News  came out and  said look  it's a misprint  no one wins  this  go fuck  yourself  pretty much  they got so  much pressure  from people  going look  I scratched  it  it matched  I want  my money  they said  alright  everyone that  had a winning  ticket that  day  send it in  to us  we'll pick  like five  was it  five winners  yeah  we'll pick  five winners  they will each  win $100,000  that's how we're  going to settle  this whole thing  so  Iraq was one  of the people  that scratched 
[02:04:00]  off as a  $100,000  winner  so he sent  in that ticket  lo and behold  months later  he gets  notified by  the Daily News  you are one  of the five  winners of  $100,000  which is just  amazing if you  think about it  amazing  we were joking  about it that day  what are the odds  so he won  $100,000  well these guys  jump on him  in a second  saying that  he got his  scratch and match  card out of  the various  papers we get  here on a  daily basis 
[02:04:30]  now if you look  all over the  studio here  if you're on  camera  or if you're  watching the  camera  you can see  there's tons  of papers  the staff  insists  that's where  he got the  scratch and  match card  and since  that's where  he got it  it wasn't  his scratch  and match  card  it was  the studios  all involved  and that he  should have  shared in  some of the  riches  it's not even  so much  it's not  that at all  as a matter of  yeah  it's just  I'm completely  fucking wrong  on this  no no  not completely  wrong  I'm just  saying  it's not  on the phrasing  of that 
[02:05:00]  a  it's not  that you  know  I  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  am  care  for  that  I 
[02:05:30]  see  yeah  I  say  ok  I  stood  under  that  a  and  I  don't  suck  a  I  I  use  something  that  I  sound  Canadian  all right  Danny  what was it  actually  go ahead  sweetie  don't be  shy  it was  just  more of  the fact  that he  just  wouldn't  admit  it  was  a  show  pay  like  we  all  know  it's  a  show  babe  just  no one  cares  just  yeah  it's  a  show  babe  he  can't  at  this  point  he  can't  even  if  it  is  or  isn't  true  there's  no way  he  can  say  it's  a  show  so  you  bought  that  paper 
[02:06:00]  at  home  there  have  been  lawsuits  oh  yeah  about  stuff  like  this  you  bought  it  from  home  yeah  it  was  your  paper  have  my  paper  here  and  you  of  all  people  I  asked  you  for  weeks  hey  what  are  those  numbers  you  showed  me  that  stupid  site  where  you  could  scratch  the  fucking  numbers  I  had  that  thing  in  my  bag  I  came  in  that  morning  and  you  were  talking  about  it  looking  through  the  paper  I  had  no  idea  I  said  oh  let  me  go  see  if  I  have  it  I  I  went  and  scratched 
[02:06:30]  paper  exactly  all right  how  about  yesterday  no  I  never  not  even  that  day  no  I  had  the  scratch  thing  in  my  bag  for  a  few  weeks  from  home  yeah  from  the  Sunday  paper  why  would  you  oh  because  you  won  yeah  and  you  got  to  check  it  off  every  day  you  have  the  papers  here  so  when  the  daily  news  came  in  I  scratch  the  numbers  if  I  missed  it  I  asked  Travis  what's  that  website  that  has  the  numbers 
[02:07:00]  and  he  would  get  it  for  me  and  I  would  scratch  it  I'm  going to  have to  maybe  go with  EROC  yeah  oh  you'd  scratch  it  off  something  from  a  Sunday  paper  it  comes  in  the  Sunday  paper  but  you've  got to  go  daily  on it  when  you  go  daily  every  newspaper  has  the  same  number  meaning  like  the  unique  number  it  comes  in  the  thing  you've  got  a  Sunday  paper  because  we  get  the  Sunday  papers  here 
[02:07:30]  okay  and  so  do  you  have  this  week's  scratch  and  match  in  your  book  bag  no  I  stopped  that  I  can't  even  if  I  won  it  I  can't  claim  it  even  if  he  did  take  it  from  the  Sunday  paper  from  here  which  maybe  he  did  and  I  wouldn't  doubt  that  or  I  wouldn't  carry  the  way  simply  because  no  one  else  would  have  thought  to  do  that  so  I  wouldn't  fault  how  many  winning  hundred  thousand  dollar  misprints  were  in this  studio  I  don't  know  I  was  the  only  one  who  was  vocal  about  having  it  right  and  I  believe  there  were  other  ones  why 
[02:08:00]  weren't  those  sent  in  by  the  staff  to  be  chosen  out  of a  hat  I  think  because  E-Rock  took  the  initiative  to  actually  send  it  in  and  had  some  luck  and  one  and  mine  was  from  my  paper  they  didn't  look  in  the  office  papers  that's  their  problem  that I'm  still  a little  if  on  but  I  wouldn't  carry  the  way  because  it's  from  Sunday  paper  which  we  don't  use  anyway  so  if  they  delivered  here  and  you  took  that  thing  out  and  it  wasn't  like  you  had  an  arrangement  with  the  guys  yes  Danny  what's  up  Dan  I  thought  he  just  gonna  get  on  Mike  he's  a  fucking  dick  anyway  yeah 
[02:08:30]  this  is  actually  the  least  of  my  problems  exactly  yeah  but how come  you don't get mad at these guys  like I don't see you like ever yelling at these guys  I don't know maybe because I'm an idiot  and I actually try and do some nice stuff for these guys  okay  yeah because I forgot we work in a nursing home  are you kidding  when's the last time we just like cheered each other up for no reason  not like shit like that  hey Travis  you like those flowers I brought in this morning  did you like the chocolates  oh I was touched  all right next time you need people to show up at a comedy show of yours because you can't 
[02:09:00]  go on stage unless you have  I had  I had five  I needed five  I had seven  you were six and seven  you left halfway through the show  I left after your performance  I didn't need you  how does that sound  but you kept asking me  you kept saying  you're coming tonight  you're bringing somebody  because you said you would  I obviously have to make sure you do  I paid the fucking money so you could go on stage  to watch your performance 
[02:09:30]  oh big deal  it was five dollars  it was supposed to be 10 but it was five  because not enough people  what nice things are you trying to do for these guys besides that  every now and then I've taken them out to lunch  which they're going to go  oh yeah yeah  oh rock and roll deli or something  nobody else was taking you to lunch or doing anything so I was doing it every now and then  especially when you were interns and weren't getting paid  I took you out  that's true  aww  but he expensed it so it doesn't really count  it doesn't matter  it doesn't matter if he expenses it  he's trying to 
[02:10:00]  yeah  you're right  Danny's just looking to find something else to blast me on  he's sitting there with his head shaking  now is that accurate that he took you guys out to lunch and he did support fans comedy  and you did give your PSP to Danny right  yeah  that you won  fair and square  yep  yeah I mean why not  I mean so  the guys got a hundred thousand he stole from the guys  there's nothing wrong with that  yeah  well so it sounds like Eric does some nice stuff for you guys  he gave you the PSP  he competed  he won fair and square  apparently he's also keeping a list of these things  so he can throw it in our face at a moment's notice  oh yeah like you're not doing it to me with this shit 
[02:10:30]  yeah we just read a list  you guys are keeping track pretty good  well because it's in the spirit of the show to mash other people  I think Eric has made a few valid points here  I like the excitement that fans showed  Maury keeps coming in and asking Eric for his cut  well I mean  come on that was funny  I don't get it  Maury  Maury  I want my money  I want my money  I want my money  fuck him that mayonnaise eating Mick  so I think Eric's made a few very valid points 
[02:11:00]  the guys seem to be a bit speechless on that one  I know  I think he wins the scratch and match thing  we're going to have to cross that off to us  you got your cross off everything  yes I do  I got  well I got one now  but I mean even as a whole  crossing off  scratch and match  even as a whole though I'm saying  with them  them giving him a trashing  maybe what sometimes deserves it  but it seems like he had some very valid responses  he's done some nice stuff  it's the guys  why  alright but the rest of the guys are regrouping right now  I know they are 
[02:11:30]  I see them regrouping in the corner  like hyena  I saw them look for it  and the fan went  why  yeah  this is  why  did you only get one hour of sleep last night  oh yeah  uh oh  I was eating  I was watching a movie  doing some work  and then went to bed  for an hour  but what time did the movie end  I don't remember  I guess like two  why would you watch a movie  at midnight  when you have to be up at work at 4.30  because I was here  I knew I wasn't going to be late  you slept  you slept here  yeah 
[02:12:00]  can I have that highlighter  I just need to highlight something  uh  he's got to highlight something  give the man a highlighter  what does it matter that I slept an hour  because  it's the time management issue  that we have brought up  that is  one of the major concerns  you're not good at managing time  guess not  according to their standards  no  but then  when we have to  also  work more  you know  to make up for that  that's my  oh you're saying like  if somebody just sleeps an hour  that someone's going to have to pick up that slack 
[02:12:30]  because you can't possibly  do the job you're supposed to do  on an hour's sleep  no I'm saying like  uh  I'm wrong again  Jesus fuck  well  I just can't  you know Anthony  I try to explain something for the listeners  and from Danny and Dan  now I get  no  it's nothing like that  what it is  is  no that was my fault Anthony  it's actually not even  like you're a little wrong  it's like you'll explain to me  and I go  you know it's funny  the complete opposite of what you just said  yeah yeah  just take what Anthony said  and play it backwards  because that's uh  completely wrong  I'm not saying you don't appreciate the effort Anthony  if you try to do 
[02:13:00]  I only had an hour's sleep last night  where's uh  not so you can pick up my slack  that's a complaint I had about your time management  where's Ben in all this  and where's Steve in all this  Ben's probably just cackling  jerking off at this  Ben is laughing somewhere  talking to someone in Boston  who has no idea who these guys are  and he's still filling them in  I'm 30 Rockets fan  it's our guys  Ben fills you in on gossip  that you're not there for the beginning of  that's the beauty of Ben  he'll come over and go  yeah Tim one time told Frank  he wasn't going to come down  but he came anyway  who's Tim  who's Frank  who fucking cares  ah here comes Steve 
[02:13:30]  real fast  Rob on Long Island  Rob  hey what's going on guys  hey  how you doing sweet bun  yeah I wish I was home this morning  just so I could watch all this  on Palet Talk  I'm freaking working  I would just love to see all the commotion  in the studio  yeah it really is funny  because it's just people  leaving the studio  coming in  bitching  leaving  coming back in  a lot of action  Chris in Jersey  before we get to Steve  Chris  hey Steve  sorry  just tell him  Eric  just tell him  oh boy  oh boy  you are nervous  dude dude  take a breath 
[02:14:00]  just take one  deep  go ahead  he punched out  like a champ  he left right  yeah  that plane was in flames  Steve where are you  in all this  I've noticed  the tension  between these guys  and EROC  for a while  I think the  really  the scratch and match  thing is such a  minute symptomatic  issue here  guys it's on silent  I heard a buzz  you know  they call Steve  every time  he walks in here  funny part is  I saw Travis  do the call  him  and I see  I see Derek 
[02:14:30]  I'm looking  I'm like  did Derek not see  that because  it would be great  and Derek whispers  to me  when he starts  talking  and then we  just heard  holy shit  I thought it was  big bear  yeah he thought  it was an itch  his big claw  came up  and scratched  I thought it was  bees trying to  get at his honey  they sting  the little soft  nose  alright Steve  what do you have  on this  it's been  brewing for a  while  I think the  scratch and  match thing  is just one  little piece  of it  I think the 
[02:15:00]  time management  thing is valid  we've all  noticed that  I mean  Eric works  hard  I think he  just doesn't  know how  to focus  it  at all  he doesn't  know  how to  allocate  his energy  bundle of  energy  but  it's just  going off  in the  outer space  is that what  you're saying  or am I  fucking wrong  Steve  you're close  you're close  you're close  I think  Jesus Christ  he takes  picky pizza  no  he's enthusiastic  I think  he tries to  take on  way too many  activities  at once  way too many  of these  tasks  at once  let me ask  seriously 
[02:15:30]  chemotherapy arms  do you think  that the guys  are a little  they're just  shaved  they are smooth  as silk  Julia Roberts  would love  these arms  and dying  young  do you think  the guys  are a little  too hard  on Eric  because he's  very good  at a lot  of things  I think  if this  had come  out gradually  it wouldn't  be so  venomous  I think  it's all  coming out  at once  I think  a year  and change  worth  of criticism  is now  coming all  out at once  and that's  why it's  so venomous  but didn't 
[02:16:00]  he take  them out  to lunch  a lot  it's nice  and I've done  some nice  things in my  life  but it doesn't  make up  for all the  shitful  things I've  ever done  where's Ben  I want to  get Ben's  take  where is Ben  these guys  are under  Eric  Eric is a  little higher  up  by some  cruel twist  of fate  he's been  in the game  a long time  but Ben  Steve is  I guess  higher up  right  I don't know  the hierarchy  but Steve is  I would think  Steve is  up there  Ben have you  been listening  to this  Ben's pretty  much in trouble  with all these  guys  speaking of 
[02:16:30]  take to lunch  I do that  all the time  too  so  oh  thought that  the two bosses  would ever take  it  two Christmases  in a year  what  take to lunch  or anything  yeah  remember we  talked about  this  two years  if I stayed  in town  I would  I would  take  everybody  out to  lunch  I've been  known to  spring for  dinner  as a matter  of fact  that's very  true  we went  out to  dinner  in DC  that is  true  and we  saw  Ant and his  girl  we chatted  for a while 
[02:17:00]  we ordered  dinner  and they  said it's  been paid  for  we all  of a sudden  Anthony  had left  his credit  card  oh  I would  do that  because  you know  you guys  work very  hard  but  no  I usually  foot the  bill  if we're  doing  anything  but  you won't  catch me  for fucking  lunch  because I'm  on the  expressway  so the  answer is  slash  Ant's  tires  sit around  and get a  lunch  slash my  tires  you're eating  good  so what's  up with  the E-Rock  bed  I think  what Steve  said  a lot  of it's  valid  and it's 
[02:17:30]  building up  I mean the  biggest thing  around here  that goes on  is the  taking credit  when stuff's  not  I think  that that  pisses a lot  of people  off  I feel  bad  but look  he's just  sitting there  it's a mic  against his  face  it seems  like that  is a big  thing with  these guys  somebody will  do something  and then Eric  will say  that he did  it  that's been  brought up  a million times  can we get  one example  of that  just any  example  of  something  where  one of you  guys has  done something  and he's  taken some 
[02:18:00]  type of  but Danny  got his  PSP  that was  actually  really nice  of Eric  and it was  I told  Eric  oh yeah  look at  that  but  but this  didn't start  off with  what has  E-Rock  done for  you  lately  isn't that a  Paul Abdul song  by the way  of course  right now  is it  what have  you done  for me  Janet Jackson  who would know  anyway  but I like  you more  for not  knowing  that  thank you  good for  you  you shouldn't  have known  that  good boy  you know  what  some of 
[02:18:30]  this stuff  might have  been earlier  and I have  gotten a lot  better with this  and giving you  guys credit  they'd run in  with a note  or something  and I'd give  it to him  and he would  say oh  Eric found  this  or they sent  me a link  oh Eric  found that  I'm not  going to  correct him  on the air  right now  oh no  no it was  Danny  but every  time  now that  they give  something  I wrote  down  this is  from Ben  this is  from Danny  this is  from  oh I  got it  if he  hands  you the  note  you just  say  Eric  just  handed  me  this  assuming  that  E-Rock  came up  with whatever  I was  getting from him  and they had 
[02:19:00]  said that to me  I said you know  what you're right  but I wasn't  going to stop  you guys  in the middle  of saying  something  so every  time now  I point out  Ben said  this  Derek said  this  Danny brought  this in  I never say  oh this is  what I found  that's kind  of an iffy  situation  because sometimes  you definitely  I mean it's  easy for me to say  I get credit  because I talk  so people hear it  and so if you  have something  you send  and you want  credit for  but sometimes  you can't  stop the flow  if you give  something  so you're not  always obligated  to  I mean it's  kind of hard  well Patrick  in Jersey  has his take  on this  Patrick  yeah all these  guys are just  fucking jealous 
[02:19:30]  they're all pissed  off they were  all interns  you know  and they're  ripping on him  because he was  the guy you hired  and he is a little  bit above them  and that's what  they know  and then $100,000  on top of that  ever since then  you guys have  all treated him  like garbage  you guys were  all lowly interns  that we decided  to hire  on the way in  and out the  fucking door  in a matter  of a month  or two  and through  some cruel  twist of fate  don't use my  line against me  you have jobs 
[02:20:00]  here  Iraq was there  right from the  start  hired on his  merits  hired from  day one  and yeah  maybe there's  a little  jealousy there  what is this  Iraq thing  you guys just  handed me  somebody  and who wants  to take credit  for this  Jesus  now we got  to make sure  everyone gets  the proper credit  it's not even  like that  oh no  you're wrong  Hopi  Hopi you're  fucking wrong  too  two blithering  idiots at the  mic  just getting  everything wrong  but Danny  knows it all 
[02:20:30]  we'll guide you  please  obviously we need it  not a correct word  has come out of my  mouth all day  that was Anthony  what's this thing  you found  hope  this is a little  bit that we found  on Iraq's website  and it's quite  enjoyable  here's a website  I didn't know that  I'll link it to  my wife's page  what's your website  the old one  it was pseudoradio.net  he says the old one  which means there's 
[02:21:00]  stuff on there  he's embarrassed  about but he has  prefaced it by saying  it's old  it's old so that  protects him  that's what I say  when I play the audio  from the BAB days  that's old audio  right  that's what you do  oh god  that was a long  time ago  prefaced it by saying  that  what'd you find  Danny  what is it  it's just a nice  embarrassing little  piece of production  embarrassing  oh god  here it is  we're gonna have  a problem here  yes who's back  where's the good  grease bed's back 
[02:21:30]  tell a friend  grease bed's back  grease bed's back  grease bed's back  I like it already  grease bed's back  grease bed's back  grease bed's back  grease bed's back  yeah believe your ears  it's me  the grease  the 997  GNX  and man I am  psyched  can this possibly  be so real  it's the doodad  daddy who makes you  squeal  doing lawmen  south of the border  and keeping all  them maggots in  big need for 
[02:22:00]  sounding a wee bit  crass  but the grease fan  is about to kick  some morning show  ass  the 997  is where he'll roam  with GNX  being his new home  now this looks like  it's not for me  other morning shows  close for those  go see  as we're on these  little controversies  cause Florida's empty  without B  yes I did that  I was also paid  a lot of money  to do that  how would you make  off that  he paid me  I think  seven eight hundred  prostitutes make a lot  taking cocks in their ass  too  that sounds very familiar 
[02:22:30]  that does sound  very familiar  Derek  do we have something  that sounds kind of  like that  oh yeah  production's never  been revamped  before ever  oh no  oh no  oh no  did you rip  someone off  who  no  yeah myself  see that  the funny thing  about that  is there's a guy  rapping  that actually  sounds like you  and that's the  ironic part  it couldn't be  I could  cause I would  never look at  no no  it could never  have been  Eric  rapping  rapping 
[02:23:00]  Eric  that wouldn't  have happened  what you heard  was somebody  that sounded  a lot like  Eric  rapping  because  you never  would have  rapped  right  please  you wouldn't  have rapped  like if I was  going to write  a rap about  you  I'd say  look  I don't  mean to  rag it  but if that  was really  you  you're a  fucking  faggot  he has a  little hip hop  in him  hip hop  you guys are  killing him  if hip hop  is a brand  of mayo  Derek you got  that

[02:25:00]  folks  it's showtime  the OB and  Anthony show  I would have  liked if you  rapped a little  about us  though  in there  why didn't you  rap  you should have  rapped  I made that  around the  same time  wait so he  ripped off  himself  yeah  that's what  I said  it was  my deal  so you're  like doing  a John  Fogerty  that's right  do you know  the John  Fogerty story  about how  he was sued  for CCR  songs and  he wrote  the song  he wrote  the song  then when  he was 
[02:25:30]  John  Fogerty  it sounded  very similar  to the  CCR  stuff  he did  oh  a little  known story  there  I thought  maybe he  wrote a  song  like  John  Fogerty  I'm the  young douche  down the  road  so he  just ripped  off himself  who cares  about that  swinging  a bit  why don't  you cock  your bat  and swing  at it  again  I can't  believe  Nathaniel  told that  awful joke  sometimes we  pass credit  along  you want  more credit  you can  take credit  for that  thanks buddy 
[02:26:00]  let's go  to Todd  the trucker  Todd  yeah  good morning  guys  about a  year ago  when you  guys were  down in  New Orleans  I called  the show  and said  that I  was on  Jimmy's  plane  as he  was flying  down there  and ended  up giving  a plug  for Jimmy  and you  know I  never got  credit  for that  yeah you  did stupid  they said  we're going  to Todd  the trucker  everybody  started ripping  me off  after that  your bit  sucks  Jimmy never  bought me  lunch  after that  either  so I'm  kind of  pissed off  about all  that  I apologize 
[02:26:30]  I owe you  one  dunk  Bill in  Boston  yeah I  want to  call and  defend Eric  he did a  fantastic job  with the  charity auction  and when  Laurie and I  came and  visited the  studio we  had a great  time and  he was  really nice  Eric worked  really hard  on that  yeah he  did do a  great job  probably a  couple extra  hundred hours  work  absolutely  helping a  bunch of  people  how much did  we raise  there  well over  $50,000  well over  $50,000  for the  victims  half what  he stole  from these  guys  I mean 
[02:27:00]  we can all  agree he took  on that  project  pretty much  absolutely  we're not  saying Eric's  never done  anything  wow what a  compliment  way to be a  diplomat fan  we're not  saying he's  never done  anything  we're not  saying he  should get  AIDS  I intentionally  didn't elaborate  alright  are we done  I think you  guys are a little  hard on you  right  yeah  I think that  was good though  I think that  cleared the air  oh yeah  I feel hollow  inside  I know I want  to hear that  rap again before  the end of the  day  yeah that was  a good one  I'll bring 
[02:27:30]  80 degrees  yeah  we'll all try  to work better  as a team  for the show  there you go  for the good of  the show  that's what I  want to hear  alright  the fucking  the peshy  Frank Vincent  handshake was  more sincere  than Raging Bull  when he had  like the bandage  arm  are you trying  to kill me  shake hands  no grudges  yeah  we should make  them all shake  hands  oh no  really  actually I  think  yeah line up  and shake hands  I think more  than that 
[02:28:00]  I think in this  day and age  a bunch of  guys like  a hug  not a faggoty  hug  but just like  a man's  one of those  like hey  what do they  call it  a shug  half handshake  half hug  I like the hug  shoulder hug  keep the hand  in between  so it's not good  yeah  listen  because we're  at the end  of the year  here  we're going  to turn a  new page  and start  off 2006  on the right  foot  right  so why don't  you guys  like either  hug or shake  I think we need  everyone line up  I think  we need a hug  I think a hug  the type of hug  that a man  will give 
[02:28:30]  wear like  one hand  on each  ass cheek  and the helmets  touch  and you both  just think  about it  because the  tension is  getting in the  way behind the  scenes now  so I think  it's time  let's add  homosexual tension  to the whole  thing  it's going to  be awful  it might as well  be hot  I think  E-Rock  and Than  I think  a hug  is in order  I do  I think all  of them should  man  I think so  it'll break  the ice though  get Ben in  here  get Ben in  here  a handshake  from Ben  he's the leader 
[02:29:00]  of these  clowns  well he's got to  shake or do  something  shakes all day  lift the mic up  because we want to  catch this on the  air here  all right E-Rock  why don't you stand  up who wants to  start this  yeah who's going  to start  I'll start  all right  Jimmy's going to  start  who are you  going to hug  you  later  all right who's  going to start  this is so awkward  Danny is going to  start with  well let's see

[02:30:30]  thing  and Iraq  you say one  nice thing  back  let's try to  clear the air  finally here  this has been  building up  for months  one encouraging  thing about  somebody else's  alright  Steve  we'll start  with you  yeah  bear  Eric  that's a  fantastic t-shirt  you're wearing  alright  wait wait  Iraq  to Steve  Steve  you have  very sexy  smooth arms  alright  he does  I didn't make

[02:33:30]  to thank Travis  for something  alright Travis  like surviving  Auschwitz  he's a slender lad  a lot of chances  he just doesn't  do it on the air  but behind the scenes  he does contribute  a lot  like what  like what  pitching in  with the news  writing  for like  big A  comments  and bit ideas  he does a lot  very good  right now  a little handshake  hug  aww 
[02:34:00]  dude this is  I'm getting emotional  I mean I'm  absolutely  I'm absolutely  no you're not  that's how I cry  all right  can't a guy show  some emotion here  hey where's  Ben can't get  away with  no he's not  oh no  he can't hug  that perky jerky 
[02:34:30]  mess  they'll all be  leg bumping  his cock  by accident  don't  don't  all right  Dan  oh boy  I can't even  look  I'll try to  do this right  yeah  be serious  um  Eric  thanks for  coming to my  comedy show  I'm like Kenny  there  Jesus  that's it  um  he's got to 
[02:35:00]  pick a singular  moment like that  there's nothing  general about him  that you  appreciate  or  yes  Eric will do  anything for this  radio show  oh  I would give him  that any day of the  week  actually I believe  that  all kidding aside  I believe that  yep  there you go  and uh  Eric  uh  fan  for as uh  short a time  as you've been  doing stand up  you're a hell of  a lot funnier  than people that  have been around  for a long time  it's kind of  qualifying  it's a little bit 
[02:35:30]  because there have  been people that  are out there  a long time  that are such  bad hacks  uh  I wouldn't  uh  even go  Sam  so it's not  really putting you  on that good  a level  like I thought  you'd blow  but  right  nah but I  think I know  what he means  he's saying  that you're a  new guy  and you're  doing good  and I  I think I  know that  that's a  pretty good  compliment  and I  I wish I  knew how  to quit you  that was  Travis  who wrote  that  everybody  Travis  Travis  wrote that  on a piece  of paper  and put it 
[02:36:00]  in front  of me  way to go  Travis  and you  read it  wrong  I'm sure  and now  the very  awkward hug  Danny  was that  right  did I  read it  right  here they  go  oh wow  yeah  he pulled  him in  then pulled  him in  that was  nice  I think  Ben  should  have  to  at least  Ben  won't  hug  Ben  should  hug  Ben  should  do  something  Ben  should  have  to  hug  he's  on the  horn  let's  get  Ben  he's  not  on the  horn  he's  making  believe  he's  on the  horn  he's 
[02:36:30]  not that  good  an actor  he's  got the  phone  backwards  anything  to do  with  emotion  Ben  does  want  to  be  a part  of  devoid  of  emotion  the only  time he  leans  over  he looks  like he's  crying  but then  he notices  an album  in his  lap  when it  comes  to  emotions  he's  pretending  to be  on the  phone  who  is he  talking  to  someone  go down  the  there  is  no  one  on  the  phone  with him  someone  go down  with the  wireless  and see 
[02:37:00]  what the  hell  is  going  on  yeah  let's  do  that  eric do  you go  it's  Ben  on the  phone  eric take  Ben  doesn't  qualify  take the  mic  and go  into  the  office  and ask  Ben  where  your  hug  is  you need  a hug  and then  call him  out  ask him  who's  on the  phone  he doesn't  have  headphones  he's  entering  the  office  he's  going  in  yeah 
[02:37:30]  can you  hear this  yes  yeah  okay  I'm getting  yelled at  he's on  the phone  he says  he can't  talk  who's  on the  phone  ask him  who is  he on  the  phone  he's  getting  red  in  the  face  who  is  he  on  the  phone  with  he's  10  seconds  from  dying  every  minute  who  is  he  on  the  phone  with  alright 
[02:38:00]  now  he's  off  the  phone  I'm not  hugging  this  fucking  faggot  why  aren't  you  hugging  him  I'm not  gonna  hug  eric  well  just  Ben  you  don't  understand  I'm  not  hugging  eric  Ben  you  don't  understand  it's  all  about  a camaraderie  that the show  needs  you can do a handshake  something  it's a handshake  wait but you gotta go through the process  the process is  that you have to say something nice about him and he says something nice about you  and then you shake him  not about clothing or any specific thing 
[02:38:30]  generally speaking  so we can move on  you know I still think and I told him the day when he did it I thought it was a nice thing  considering the amount of tension with eric and danny that he was nice enough to give  him his uh his playstation  I thought that was a powerful move  that was a good move and I even told eric that  that was a powerful move  so that was a nice thing from today  eric  I think um ben sometimes gets a lot of heat but he does a good job uh running the show  behind the scenes  and we almost did leave you yesterday unfortunately  yeah I know I heard fuck him  and now uh  and now a handshake 
[02:39:00]  and a hug  ah then we know  a little  no no  a little shoulder bump hug  not a thaggy hug  that was the manly one  like you do with your Boston buddies  that was the worst one  after a few beers  after a few beers  but the handshake wasn't sincere  nah it wasn't  you looked away and moved back as you were shaking  Jim interrupted me  see we shook him  yeah  made eye good  the first time you ever shook my hand and looked me in the eye  alright  who's up for a group hug  eh some army commercial  alright  I think Poe wants to hug eric though  yeah why are you here  yeah why is Poe in here  what kind of question 
[02:39:30]  there was some kind of like  Poe's thinking there was going to be a fight  well ben told me to come inside because he thought that uh  fists were going to fly  oh really  no  well  now is there any tension between Poe and eric  because eric's like what are you doing here  what kind of tension is there  let's get to the bottom of this  we got to clear the air here  we're taking care of all family business  there's a little bit of tension  we're going to change the bit uh for this one  um eric what don't you like about master Poe  yeah  that's right  what would you say to him 
[02:40:00]  if he hasn't been trained to kill  since he was four  that's right  if he was uh  yeah paralyzed in a wheelchair  what would you say  there's one thing that bothers you about master Poe  besides that ridiculous hat  that's right  anything  I'll even start  I'll start  Poe  I don't like  the way Poe  reprograms my automobile  so when I drive it home  I'm about  um  I'm about one exit from my house  before my car is back  the way I like it  I hopped in my vehicle 
[02:40:30]  the other day  in the garage  and I thought  I had gotten  in the back door  and sat in the back seat  the steering wheel  was so far away  I didn't know it  I know you're a big guy  and everything  but  oh my  and then there was some type of  techno music  playing on my system  the heat was up to 95 degrees  and my dome light was on  I had no idea what happened  that's the only problem  I have  with uh  with master Poe  the only one you'll admit  on the air  there we go  I have a problem with Poe  I don't like the way  you refuse to kick  Travis in the chest 
[02:41:00]  if he had one  he would  alright  E-Rock  um  I don't like  when master Poe  comes over  and asks who  a certain celebrity  or artist is  and then we inform him  and then he goes over there  and acts like he knows  their entire body of work  alright  now that's too far  Poe  kick his fucking ass  yeah  that's too far  who did he do this with  um  there was one time  with uh  Joe Perry coming in  he goes  who was that 
[02:41:30]  who was that  you fucking idiot  who was that  dude  who was it  but Jimmy always drops him  to the mic  to the mic  yeah  that was yours  that was absolutely not mine  that was Jimmy  alright  that was not me  it was me  it was Jimmy  I wanted credit  alright  that's a good one  anyone else  Danny  you can pull  respond too  he has to respond  yeah  problem with 
[02:42:00]  can I respond to yours  or should I  they're beyond reproach  yeah we are  we're pretty much  we have immunity  most of these people  that come in here  I don't know them  and I don't know  anything about them  so I go to you  to get that information  because I know  you have this  oh see  he's saying  you're knowledgeable  in that  am I right  I hope so  Danny  any problem  you probably didn't  have anything bad  to say about Eric  not that he hates  yeah we changed a bit 
[02:42:30]  bad  anything bad  anything that annoys you  about Eric  no  wow  see Paul bottled up  and kind of forget  that he has it  until he throws a punch  and it will all be remembered  and he'll take it all out  on one guy  with those knuckles  alright  give him a handshake  or a hug  and let's  take a break or something  alright  there it is  and let's do some real hugging  on the break  turn off that camera  nude  I'll show you how men  make up in this town  you can't really make up 
[02:43:00]  and hug unless you're nude  you know it's funny  you say that joking  but there is a cathartic feeling  when there's just like  a couple of man chests  and like kind of hairy legs  Steve's already taking  his clothes off  look  doesn't take much  this fucking awful  long sleeve shirt  that doesn't go past his belt  that's what I don't like  about Steve  probably slides right off  of those silken arms too  yeah all he's got to do  is bend over  and touch his toes  and the shirt  just tumbles off  baby old chest  old graphite

So now twice a week, I'm getting paid to tap him.  He laced me with the cash and the Visa Platinum.  One month later and the cat's out the bag.  Cause this motherfucker started dressing in drag.  But I did my thing and I had my fun with him.  It was time to cut him off because I'm done with him.  Crying like a bitch and he's starting to beg. 
[02:57:00]  He's falling on the ground, holding on to my leg.  I'm screaming, don't leave, please twist it, G.  But this is what you get when you fuck with me.  So what the fuck you think?  So what the fuck you mean?  Cause if you've seen one bag, then you've seen them all.  So what the fuck you mean?  So what the fuck you think?  Cause if you've seen one bag, then you've seen them all.  This is Tom's wife.  Tom is not gay, okay? 
[02:57:30]  I want you to stay away from Tom.  He is not gay.  We have a family and a son.  And we have a life together.  You stay away from him, you son of a bitch.  I want you to stay away from him. 
[02:58:00]  I just want to know, why are my toys sticky?  And my shoes, they keep sticking to me.  Why?  Why are my toys sticky?  Why his toys sticky?  He went there.  So that's Gangster Fag and he wants it.  Jeez, he completely converted that guy.  He sure did.  Not only did he fuck him, but then he wiped his penis on the kids' toys. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  And then brought his friends over and said, go ahead, you fuck him.  And then he charged him and then the guy put on a dress and he dumped him.  Yeah.  You gotta like this guy.  He completely changed that guy's life around.  Wrecked it.  We welcome to the show, Gangster Fag.  Don't nobody move, cause the fags are here.  Gangster Fag.  So baby, this is Twisted G, the Gangster Fag.  The gay defender, the gay avenger, the motherfucking rear-end bender, baby.  You better know how to roll.  What's up, baby?  I gotta tell you, Gangster Fag. 
[02:59:00]  What's up?  Joe Rogan turned us on to you.  Joe Rogan.  That's my booty buddy right there.  I hope not.  That's my booty.  Oh, yeah.  That's my booty buddy.  You motherfuckers are my booty buddies, too.  Let me tell you that.  Someone makes a great comment, but he hung up.  He wants to know what Joe Rogan was Googling that he found Gangster Fag online.  Actually, that's not how he found me, man.  Yeah.  Nah, check this story out.  You motherfuckers gonna trip the fuck out, man.  This shit is real.  Check this out.  All right. 
[02:59:30]  Okay.  I recorded that CD five years ago.  Okay.  All right.  As soon as I finished recording it, I got pinched on a parole violation.  And he sent me back to the motherfucking pen, right?  But I didn't even get to put my picture on the fucking cover.  I mean, the project was fucked.  And we trashed the project.  I actually got one of my booty buddies, KK, to take the picture.  Because he's a pretty motherfucker.  He can suck a good dick, but he can't rap his shit.  And so what happened was the project got trashed. 
[03:00:00]  It was fucking killed.  Right?  So I went back to the pen.  I fucked up.  You know, and everything was done with.  But we took 500 CDs to Gay Pride in Hollywood.  And gave them away for free.  Yeah.  So now five years later, I've just been out for like three fucking couple of months, actually.  And...  What are we in on?  Motherfuck, you can't ask me that shit.  I can ask.  We know it ain't...  That's like me asking you, hey, what's your social security number?  Yo...  You can't tell me that. 
[03:00:30]  Yo, Twister, we know you wasn't really guilty of this shit.  We just want to know what the fuck, with the charge they gave you.  What do they claim you did?  It was a parole violation.  I was hanging out with some motherfuckers that went through some bad things.  Oh, you're supposed to stay clear of all those motherfuckers.  Right, yeah.  I've seen I fucked up the first time on my second strike, too.  Uh-oh.  You better watch number three.  Exactly.  So check this out.  Wow.  I want to know what you did, Gangsta Fair.  You got to give us a little something.  It was those rednecks behind the bar, right?  You and your buddies going out there. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, what was that?  What song was that?  Twisted Life?  I've done a lot of bad shit.  I'm going to give you the story.  But check this shit out.  All right.  So now, I've been out for a couple of months, right?  And I'm all depressed and fucking suicidal.  And I'm real.  I'm a crazy motherfucker.  I'm going to be real.  And so I'm thinking my career.  So I got nothing to do, right?  I'm fucking up last Thursday, 3.30 in the morning, watching Current TV, thinking about  how I'm going to fucking do myself in or go back to the pen because I ain't got shit going on.  Then on Current TV, they said a Google search is up for motherfucking called a Gangsta Fag. 
[03:01:30]  And I'm going, wait a minute.  That's me.  And so motherfuckers are like, okay, we did our research to find out who he is.  So I'm thinking they're going to show me fucking a dick or something.  And I'm going, oh, shit.  Wait a minute.  What's going on?  Because as far as I knew, my shit was done.  My music was dead five years ago.  And so at that point, I fucking called my publicist.  We hit the website, the old domain Gangsta Fag.com.  Some motherfucker boy, Dickhead, Dickhead Mike.  And he was looking for me. 
[03:02:00]  So I'm going, oh, shit.  All of a sudden, I get on Google.  I feel these motherfuckers, you know, Gangsta Fag is out there.  And some punk motherfucker rules that guy, man.  Some comic, Rodriguez.  I don't know.  Anyway, he was claiming to be Gangsta Fag.  So then I have my publicist.  Someone claiming to be Gangsta Fag.  Son of a bitch.  You know what you got to do?  You got to track him down and fuck him up the ass.  Oh, I got, in case my PO's listening.  Wait, was the guy claiming to be Gangsta Fag?  Was he from Florida? 
[03:02:30]  A white kid named Eric Nagel rapping on a radio promo?  Because we know that guy.  I'm not sure who this motherfucker was.  Yeah.  But he was fronting.  So anyway, so now I'm calling you guys.  My publicist got in contact with your people and found that you guys have been playing my shit.  You know, much love.  You're my booty buddies for life, too.  I don't know if that's a good thing.  Gangsta Fag.  Do something good for you, you know.  But now, here I am, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Gangsta Fag. 
[03:03:00]  Now, you sound like the real deal.  I'm the real shit, man.  You sound like the real deal.  Now, in the joint, were you, you know, scary?  I mean, were you one of those guys that, like, if you wanted some ass, you would take it?  Check, check this shit out.  Did you see my website?  Go to GangstaFag.com.  Pull that shit up.  You see how big I am?  That's you?  Really?  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm 66260, man.  66260?  If I want some ass, I'm taking ass.  So that's what you would do?  Motherfucking ass.  That's what I'd do.  And the joint? 
[03:03:30]  That's right.  That's what I did, baby.  And the story goes, you knew you were gay at eight years old.  You got thrown out of the house at 16 by the parents?  Yep.  Sucking dick.  Got caught, man.  Got caught sucking dick.  Got caught sucking dick.  Wasn't under a little porch with a guy named Jimmy Norton, was it?  I don't even know that motherfucker's name.  It's been so many dicks six ago, you know what I'm saying?  So many dicks ago.  So many dicks.  God damn.  So you hit the rough streets of New York?  Yeah, I grew up in New York, man.  And you were homeless in New York, and you were doing the old pickpocket and selling the crack and all that, right? 
[03:04:00]  Yep, in Brooklyn, baby.  In order to survive, he eventually graduated to extortion and armed robbery.  Oh, man.  Now, see, now that's where this shit comes.  You want to know what I did.  What happened was, I learned that it was a lot easier instead of selling crack just to rob the motherfuckers that were selling crack.  That's where I get the money in the crack.  Now, what happened was...  Good business, man.  Well, exactly.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that, man.  Sure.  So what I started doing is, you know, my shit, my operations got bigger.  I had a couple other faggots down with me, and we started doing our shit. 
[03:04:30]  But now, when motherfuckers will retaliate, they had to think twice because what I started doing is,  when we catch up to them, not only will we rip their asses, but I fuck them, too.  You know what I'm saying?  Oh, my God.  So that was really humiliating and great for the average heterosexual, motherfucker.  You know what I'm saying?  So that's where I got the name Gangsta Fagg.  Because he's, yeah, a gangster, and you'd be fucking these guys.  You know how tough you have to be to rob and rape crack dealers?  You've got to be a fucking tough dude to rape other guys with guns. 
[03:05:00]  We did our thing, baby.  We did our thing.  But then shit got too hot, and I came to the West Coast, and I ran the same program on the West Coast, and I got pinched.  Yeah, I'm going to read a little bit further here.  In efforts to elude as many enemies, including the NYPD, Twisted G, that's another name you go by?  Twisted G, that's my real, the actual name.  The Gangsta Fagg comes after Twisted G.  Twisted is the opposite of being straight.  Right, I hear you.  That's like a gay term.  All right, let's go with this, then.  Twisted G fled to the West Coast.  His life of crime continued, and he got arrested numerous times. 
[03:05:30]  At age 22, he earned his first strike in a three-year prison sentence?  Yeah, man.  Three fucking years.  Baby in the booty buffet, man.  The booty buffet.  You know, Paul, I'm a dick you can sell.  Oh, jeez.  Did you get beat up a lot in jail?  You know what?  See, this is the thing.  Motherfuckers underestimated.  It's because I'm a faggot.  Don't mean I'm a faggot.  You get what I'm saying?  Right.  And so they would think, you know, all right, this is a faggot motherfucker, and I had a  little crew, some oblivious motherfucking faggots, man.  And we'd do motherfucking in a second. 
[03:06:00]  And big motherfuckers.  So they would underestimate us.  And like I said, that was my M.O.  Not only would I stick a foot in your ass, it would be followed up with a dick.  You know what I'm saying?  So if you were beating someone down, they were going to get fucked.  Exactly.  So then they wouldn't want to fuck with you.  It's like a psychological effect and shit, you know?  Right.  You're not going to like, if somebody kicks your ass, you'll go up to him and try to retaliate  by kicking his ass.  And even if you get your ass kicked again, it's all right, because you kind of tried. 
[03:06:30]  But this guy, this guy, you know, will kick your ass and fuck you in the ass.  And then you're thinking, I could try to kick his ass, but if I lose, I'm going to get  fucked in the ass again.  Right, exactly.  And I'm going to, like I said, I can handle my shit.  I'm a big motherfucker, and I know how to fight.  You know what I'm saying?  And I'm one of those crazy motherfuckers where, you know, you can whip my ass.  Yeah.  You know what you're going to do after that?  You're going to fuck me?  Why, uh.  Thank you very much.  Why three years, though, gangster fagg?  Thank you very much.  Well, it's.  You've got to give us a little something.  Arm robbery.  Well, see, they didn't, they couldn't quite pin shit on me completely. 
[03:07:00]  And so, you know, you get a lot of motherfuckers that want to try to say you did this, man,  but they can't really prove it.  But if they get enough shit on you, they get you for what they want.  You know what I'm saying?  And if you don't cooperate with them, they make an example of your ass.  And then on top of that, I'm scared a lot of motherfuckers out here because of the  shit that I was doing, man.  They didn't, you know, so in actuality, that shit even I've done three years, but you know  how that shit goes, man.  All right, let's say hi to Joe and Yonkers.  Joe, you're on with Gangsta Fag.  Yeah, man, I don't know how you're taking advice on how to be a gangster for somebody  that sucks dick, dog. 
[03:07:30]  How could you be a gangster if you suck dick?  Please tell me.  Because I suck dick very well, my man.  You know what I'm saying?  You suck dick and you take it in the ass.  You don't know nothing about being a gangster, dog.  Man, what the fuck?  You know, I think you're right.  Good point.  You're a gangster, motherfucker.  Word up, you're not a gangster, dog.  Don't even tell anybody.  Go, all right, we thought you suck dick, dog.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Do you know what the meaning of a fucking gangster is, motherfucker?  The meaning of a gangster is a motherfucker in a gang, you dumbass.  Joe, Joe, this guy sounds more...  You ain't hard.  You ain't hard.  You ain't a fuck.  You don't know how to fight, dog.  You don't know how to suck dick, dog. 
[03:08:00]  You suck dick, dog.  Don't say you gangster.  Joe, if you ask me, this guy sounds more gangster than anybody else.  I suck dick.  I'll fuck in the ass.  I'll take it in the ass.  Motherfucking right.  Like, I'd rather get beat up.  I'd rather even have to go to the hospital because I've been shot by a gangster than been fucked.  Yeah, I'm going to take Gangsta Fag's word.  I say he's a gangster.  That's a pretty rough gangster if he's fucking you.  How are you going to hit a guy in the face who doesn't squint with a nine-inch dick in his ass?  How are you going to punch him and expect to hurt him?  I don't know, Joe. 
[03:08:30]  I think you're wrong.  And a lot of guys would say, all right, he likes dick, so he can't fight.  But he's fucking 6'6", and there's still a man's fist coming at you.  Dick, he does not have a mentality that's capable of being hard.  He's a fucking fairy.  You have to understand that.  How big are you, Joe?  How tall?  I'm fucking 5'8", 130 pounds, motherfucker.  And I'm more gangster than this fucking faggot.  You know what?  I love the way motherfuckers get all upset about you.  Yeah, that's right, though.  I'm a small motherfucker, and I bet you I'm seven on you.  I think gangsta faggot would use you like a bitch. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, I ain't got nothing to prove to him, man.  It's all good, baby.  Well, let's go to Anthony in the Bronx.  What's up, Anthony?  I just wanted to say, it's big, crazy niggas like this that don't want 165-pound white boys in jail.  You're scared shitless.  Thank you, baby.  I love you, too, baby.  Just listening to him.  That's why he was saying that's why white boys don't go to jail.  Yes.  That's why we don't want to go to jail.  You can get my CD there, too, you know.  All right, we'll continue on your story.  It's almost over.  So then you did the three-year prison sentence. 
[03:09:30]  Once he was released, he immediately went back to his criminal lifestyle in order to hustle up enough money to record his rap CD entitled The Gangsta Fag.  Right.  The CD was about his hardcore gay gangster lifestyle of raping men, violence, and drugs.  His CD was out for less than a month when he got arrested and sent back to prison for a parole violation.  How many years did he do for that?  I did five, man.  Wow.  You did another five years?  Yep.  I told you, I did that five, man.  I learned my motherfucking lesson, man.  Put it that way.  You know what I'm saying? 
[03:10:00]  That's why I'm trying to get with this music shit, man.  I'm trying to lay low because I got a lot of motherfuckers, like a lot of enemies, even out here on the West Coast now.  And I don't want to fuck up and get that third strike.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not trying to fuck you to rap up, man.  All right.  Sean in New Jersey says there's a large discrepancy in your story.  Sean.  Hey, what's up?  What's up, man?  Large discrepancy with this dude's story.  What is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  First of all, three years, you only get for third-degree crimes.  You don't get that thing.  You don't get that thing or anything violent.  This is it.  This is it.  This motherfucking...  This motherfucking... 
[03:10:30]  This motherfucking...  This motherfucking...  This motherfucking...  This is...  This is...  You know nothing about prison on the way.  Hold on.  We got to get...  Hold on.  One guy at a time.  One guy at a time.  Sean, what are you trying to say?  I'm trying to say that what would happen to this guy if someone would have went to the  microwave, warmed up some oil, some baby oil, and a glass light bulb, and splashed it  right in those face.  Then I'm going to have to handle it.  Happens to the fags all the time.  That's right.  He's right.  He's absolutely right.  I ain't going to front.  That shit is real.  But that's part of the game, baby.  That's part of the game. 
[03:11:00]  That's part of the quiz tonight, baby.  All of a sudden, your skin is washed off your face.  You got no skin on your face.  Hey, he sounds sexy.  You're done.  He sounds sexy.  Happens all the time.  I like you.  Let me holler at you, baby.  He is pissing off people all over the country.  Joe in North Carolina.  Go ahead.  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey, Joe.  You said you was in a gang.  What gang on the face of the planet would have a faggot-ass nigga like you in?  Man, that's my gang, baby.  I put my own motherfucking gangs together, baby.  Anybody can put a gang together. 
[03:11:30]  Learn the game for us, baby.  Learn the game.  Nah, nigga.  I'm in a motherfucking gang, nigga.  Learn the game, baby.  Your ass is not in no gang.  Go to gangstafact.com and learn the game, motherfuckers.  I don't see why these guys can't accept the fact that this guy can be a tough motherfucker.  You know, he likes, you know, sucking dick.  This is why motherfuckers get raped while I do the shit that I did.  You see what I'm saying?  You got to prove your motherfucking point, man.  You know what I'm saying?  But it's all good.  Like, he'll grab one of these guys, just beat him silly, and then go, oh, I'm not a bad guy. 
[03:12:00]  I'm not a gangster.  And then, wham, you're getting fucked in the ass.  Over the phone.  Oh, you know what I'm saying?  But when motherfuckers see me in real life, it is like, oh, oh, oh.  Maybe people are thinking old-term gangster.  Like, they get a picture like, meh, meh, see, Muggsy?  Meh, meh, you give me the money or I'll fuck you in the ass, see?  That's the way it's going to be.  Meh, curtains for you.  Meh.  Meh, give me a blowjob, see?  I think Gangster Fag makes his point, and he puts a big black exclamation point at the end of it right into your backside.  That's right. 
[03:12:30]  You're a pooper.  Let's go to Steve on Long Island.  Steve.  Hey, big fan, Gangster.  Big fan.  What about this?  Quick question.  I heard something funny happened in the pen with the dress.  Something about a dress.  You had a dress in the pen.  No, no.  That's my point.  Actually, when I was...  No, no.  It was about a dress.  You had a dress.  It was when you were locked up, you had a dress.  No, they don't allow dresses in the pen, baby.  I guess not, sir.  I'll have to go naked, baby.  Booty naked, baby.  Good call back, Steve.  Hey, did that ever have...  That song we listened to before we got you on the air there. 
[03:13:00]  Anything like that ever happen to you?  That happens all the time, baby.  All the time.  What?  Businessman...  Those are the most motherfucking undercovers.  You know, we call it the DL.  Right.  And you'd be amazed at how many motherfuckers are like that.  And actually, even a lot of callers, man.  It's like, even in the pen, you get a lot of motherfuckers, like, these motherfuckers  that are calling, whatever, whoop-de-whoop.  But even in the pen, you get these motherfuckers, and they get in there, and they start sucking  dick, or they get fucked, and they're like, but I'm not gay.  How the fuck are you not going to be gay if you're in the pen getting your dick sucked 
[03:13:30]  or sucking the dick?  But they say, you know, it's just to get me through until I get out.  It's just sexual.  I can, you know, separate the two.  You know, so it's just a bunch of bullshit, baby.  All right, we're moving on with your story.  So after serving a five-year sentence and earning his second strike, Twisted G is back  on the streets again.  Assuming that his rap career was over, he was convinced that he'd have no other choice  but to return to a life of crime and face his third strike and life in prison.  There you go, baby.  But upon his release, he was informed that his music had a loyal following thanks to 
[03:14:00]  Joe Rogan and Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  All right.  I'm motherfucking funny, baby.  It's the sad.com.  Go there and get your T-shirts.  Can't we just be called, uh, friends?  I think you would.  I don't like the booty buddies thing.  I think it's fine.  I think, you can be Jimmy's booty buddy.  You can be Jimmy's booty buddy.  Anthony and I just want to be, uh, your friend.  Uh, well, no, I'll be you.  You can be friend.  I want to be as far away as possible. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  I will be a, uh, I will be a long-distance friend.  Twisted G scares the living shit out of me.  On so many levels, it's not even funny.  You feel good.  All right.  So, uh, we're helping him out and then it finishes here.  He now has a second chance to prove to the world that he is one of the greatest gangster  rappers of all time.  He is attempting to raise enough money legally to record his hardest album ever.  Gangsta Fag is back with a vengeance coming soon in your mouth.  In your motherfucking mouth, baby. 
[03:15:00]  That's right.  That's right.  So, that's what I'm trying to do, man.  I'm trying to get my house.  I'm trying to sell this CD.  Right.  The one you just heard.  It's against the fact.com.  We got t-shirts that, like, it's funny as a shirt that says, uh, why are my toys sticky?  Shit like that.  And, uh, so we're trying to sell that.  Who wouldn't wear a t-shirt?  Why is my toys sticky?  I could see some of our listeners wearing those.  Ooh, wear that.  Absolutely.  Why are my toys sticky?  That's right.  And so, um, so with that money, I'm going to record my next CD, my next album, come back 
[03:15:30]  with the hard shit.  Wait, so ONA, this is, I, I didn't realize, I remember when Rogan was talking about, uh,  we played music.  I didn't know this was the first radio player that ever got, obviously, it would have been.  Of course it is.  Yeah.  My only one doing satellite radio.  This is historical.  My goal is to desecate the motherfucking rap game, baby.  I'm going to make a fucking, I'm going to ridicule all these motherfuckers, man.  They're going to get outwrapped by a motherfucking gay faggot rapper.  What about Eminem?  You rapped about Eminem.  Do you like him or do you not like him?  You know what?  That's a pretty motherfucker.  I ain't going to lie.  I do, you know, I fuck him.  I ain't going to front. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, but when I did that CD, it was five years ago, and that's when he was talking a lot  of shit about faggots, man.  You know what I'm saying?  All right.  And so, but actually, he's a talented motherfucker.  I give him credit.  All right, let's go to Dallas.  Baby Boy has a comment for Gangsta Fag.  Baby Boy.  Yo, what's up, man?  I ain't saying, look here.  Y'all need to get this old faggot ass motherfucker off the goddamn radio, man.  Don't pick me no way.  He wants sick.  He needs what's up.  He wants sick.  He wants sick.  Nigga, I'm a person.  I'm a person.  Boy, I come from nigga.  I'm out of Dallas, man. 
[03:16:30]  Ain't nobody move because the faggots.  That's off the motherfucking radio, nigga.  Ain't nobody move because the faggots.  Yeah.  What's up, baby?  They don't faze me, man.  I love it.  I love it when they get all pissed out of shit.  Get in your ass and try to fuck me, nigga.  Wow.  All right.  Wow.  Thank you, baby boy.  I'm just surprised we got fucking gangstas from Dallas calling.  I'm not surprised.  Your ass is tight that you can get with me and we can fuck all night.  Love it, baby. 
[03:17:00]  That's hysterical.  He wants in.  I got to admit, your songs are a bit catchy.  They are catchy.  Thank you, baby.  Let's say hi to James in New York.  James.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  First of all, it's my birthday today, so she got to wish me a happy birthday.  No one cares, stupid.  Get to the point.  Hey, Mr. Fagg.  What's up, baby?  I'm going to be out on the West Coast next week cruising in a Saturn around the HBO studios.  If you could come look me up, I'm a little midget nothing with a weak chin and tits and yeah. 
[03:17:30]  You know, sir, I don't drive a Saturn when I'm out there, stupid.  You know, you're even talking to me, motherfuckers, manhole.  You suck, Jimmy.  You suck.  Those manholes are getting wet.  They're just hot.  A lot of questions for the gangsta fag.  You know what?  I got to say, gangsta fag, we have a very homophobic producer named Ben Sparks, and he actually  dared you to rape him when you come to New York.  He wants it.  Is he a pretty motherfucker? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, he is.  You might have to prove that you're a gangsta fag.  We might have to plan you to New York.  But I hear you're not even allowed to leave L.A. or something like that.  I'm not for a couple of months, man.  I'm working on that shit now.  I'm going to be on the street.  I'm going to be doing a little.  Thank God.  Let's go to Rich somewhere on the West Coast.  Rich, what's up?  Actually, from New York.  Oh, okay.  I understand that gangsta fag had a song about one time when he was at camp and wanted to  blow this cute little white boy with fantastic eyes, and all that little white boy told him  was, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee. 
[03:18:30]  I don't think that ever happened with gangsta fag.  Bunch of Al Valdez on a sexy, though.  This sounds sexy, don't it?  It didn't happen, though, you know?  Well, Anthony had something that almost happened to him, but he had a fake that he was asleep.  It's a long story.  I didn't want it.  You know, I live more than a river, baby.  Jim in Brooklyn.  Hey, gangsta, I really want to do you, bro.  Oh.  Well, you know, not you. 
[03:19:00]  All right.  Let's go to, uh, hold on, gangsta.  Let's go to Cliff in California.  Cliff.  I love it.  You're real good.  Cliff.  I want to pay respect to this guy.  He is terrifying.  Yeah.  Isn't this just, yeah.  You are like, I'll tell you, Twisted, you are like an American nightmare.  Thank you very much.  You are an American nightmare.  You know what?  You motherfuckers are responsible.  He will, uh, yeah, he will take your money and rape you with a smile on his face.  You're like fucking fag Kong. 
[03:19:30]  You come to New York, we just put you on display and hope you don't break loose and fuck everybody.  I'm doing some motherfucking Grammys with my motherfucking fag crew, baby.  How funny would that shit be?  Wouldn't that be great if you accept a Grammy and you all just shove them up your asses?  There you go.  See, that's what I'm trying to do, man.  Think of, come on, answer this shit on the real.  Yeah.  Take away all the gay shit and just go by lyrics.  How many motherfuckers out there can really fuck with me lyrically?  Think about that.  Be real.  Well, like we said, they're very catchy. 
[03:20:00]  Very catchy tunes, man.  Thank you, baby.  So that's why we're trying to, you motherfuckers can blow me up and help me ridicule these motherfuckers.  All right.  Let's go to Mike the Trucker.  Mike.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, usually the truckers don't have an open mind when it comes to this type of subject matter.  So let's see what Mike has to say for all the truckers out there.  Mike?  Well, you know, hey, man, I don't agree with what he's doing as far as on his personal level.  But as far as the rapper goes and everything, man, he's a pretty talented guy, man.  You know, so he puts his shit together real well.  You know, and I got to give him his props, you know. 
[03:20:30]  But, you know, hey, all that fag shit, you can go ahead on with that bullshit.  But other than that, man, I can't knock you for what he does, man.  You know, as far as I'm a gangster tip, gangster rapper tip, that's all right.  He's doing basically what all of them are doing out there.  And he's got an edge on it.  And what he's trying to do as far as want to put the rap world on his back, as far as what he's rapping about.  Hey, man, that's, hey, he couldn't possibly do that shit.  He can't do that.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Thanks for the love, baby.  All right.  And here's the shit, man.  The funny shit is half those motherfuckers in the rap game are fucking faggots anyway, man. 
[03:21:00]  You know what I'm saying?  But they're trying to front like they're fucking gangsters.  I have the fucking balls to come out and be motherfucking right.  I'm a faggot.  And a motherfucking gangster.  And those balls are laying on someone's chin.  Against their will.  Have you heard any of the big rappers are gay?  Man, I'm in motherfucking L.A.  Trust me, baby.  Trust me.  I know the game up in here, man.  I know the game.  Not who's lying.  You'd be shocked.  I won't do that shit because I got to lay the fuck low right now.  And I'm trying to not fuck around. 
[03:21:30]  But you will be fucking shocked.  And those are rumors that you have heard, which I'm sure you might have heard a few.  That shit is real, baby.  Okay.  Well, whatever those rumors are, I wouldn't say.  Wow.  All right, let's go to Preacher Anthony.  Preacher Anthony.  Not Bleacher Anthony.  Oh, Bleacher Anthony.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  They had Preacher.  I was thinking maybe there's another guy.  What's up?  It's Bleacher Anthony, everyone.  Gangster Fag, you want to do some tissue time with me?  That depends, baby.  That depends.  What you got?  I want you to talk dirty to me as I stick a big black Louisville slugger up your ass. 
[03:22:00]  Hey, you know what?  That reminds me of some shit.  I'm sure.  Have you ever heard of a keister stash?  What?  You ever heard of a keister stash?  Keister stash?  Yeah.  And I imagine it's something one hides in one's ass.  Right, right.  And that's the shit.  So when he said Louisville slugger, that shit reminded me, man.  Because he said that shit like he was going to scare me.  Motherfuck.  I did that shit for fun.  And the thing, what you do, the more shit you can carry in your ass, you can make money like that. 
[03:22:30]  And it's a hustle.  So you can carry weapons in your ass, shanks, fucking dope.  Whatever the fuck you want.  And you can carry for all the motherfuckers, too.  And the more shit you can carry, the more money you can make.  And so what you do is you take little fucking bottles and shit and put Vaseline on it.  You should have shoved it up your ass to make your ass bigger, man.  So that shit just took me back to some fond memories.  You must have made a lot of money.  Man, he was like, motherfucker, you turned me on.  You know what I'm saying?  You made a lot of money then?  Yeah, man.  I was like a Microsoft of prison.  It was like a man purse. 
[03:23:00]  You know what I'm saying?  A man purse.  His nickname is Micro-Ass.  Joe Rogan, my motherfucking booty buddy, baby.  A man purse.  That's the greatest thing I've ever heard.  And that's always a great one.  Someone says, I want to put a bat in your ass.  They go, that reminds me of a funny story.  I know.  That's when you know he's the real deal.  That's the memory lane and shit, motherfucker.  You scared me?  Well, everybody wants to talk to Gangsta Fact today.  Joe in Chicago.  Joe?  What's cracking, boy?  What's up, Joe?  I am 6'3". 
[03:23:30]  4'80", a former bouncer who don't mind fighting, but he makes me a little nervous.  I like his skills in the ref game, but he's going to come to Chicago.  I would not like to see you in the dark alley.  What?  You know, that's very flattering, my brother.  You're scared of Gangsta Fact.  Well, see, motherfuckers that know what time is.  They know what time is.  You know what I'm saying?  These are all the motherfuckers.  I'm 100 pounds when I'm wet, and I'll kick your ass, Gangsta Fact. 
[03:24:00]  Shut the fuck up, baby.  Now, real motherfuckers, they can tell.  They can sense it.  Now, even if my music is for everybody, even if you don't...  Now, check this out.  If you listen to my motherfucking music, you know, and you're straight, you'll find it repulsive,  fucking disgusting, and, you know, unnerving, but it's fucking hilarious.  And you'll find it, you know, that's cool.  Now, if you're listening to my shit, and you know the lyrics, and you're dancing to it,  you're a motherfucking faggot, but that's cool, too, you know what I'm saying?  My music is for everybody.  You know what I'm saying?  Except for...  I don't fuck with 18 and under shit, you know what I'm saying? 
[03:24:30]  I'll leave that to the Catholic jerks.  That's it.  All right.  Let's go to...  I'm a respectable faggot, you know what I'm saying?  All right.  Let's go to Daryl in Missouri.  Daryl?  Yeah, hey, I did time in Jefferson City in Missouri, and we had an old boy there who  was about 6'6", 240 pounds, white boy, solid-ass muscle, but he was always working out in the  weights.  That old boy would bend over and take it in the ass quicker than anybody we ever seen.  And if you didn't give it to him right, he'd beat your ass. 
[03:25:00]  There you go.  So there's boys out there like that.  Did you have to give it to him?  Uh, no, I never did, but I've seen it, Dan.  He wants it.  He needs it.  He wants it.  Gangsta fact.  Gangsta fact dot com, baby.  There you go.  Wow.  All right.  Well, uh...  But that is common, man.  And the pin I saw with is, if you want some fresh meat, motherfucker, come in there, you 
[03:25:30]  walk up to the motherfucker, yo, let me suck your dick, motherfucker.  And if this motherfucker's going to let you and your motherfucker back and take you out,  you're going to let him suck your dick.  Let me ask you this.  And now, if you want to put yourself in this situation, Mr. Opie, now, if you want to...  Hold on.  Why don't we use someone else?  No, I think Opie's a good example.  All right.  So, Opie and you in the joint.  Go ahead.  What's the scenario?  Motherfuckers come up to you.  Huge motherfucking faggots, right?  Say four or five.  Big black deer faggots.  Okay? 
[03:26:00]  Now, they tell you, yo, check it out.  You...  We want to suck your dick, motherfucker.  We're going to do you.  What are you going to do?  Come on.  Think quick.  Come on.  Be real.  I know what I would do.  I would say, is this a good answer in prison?  I've never been in prison.  And this is not old.  This is Jim.  But if they said that, I'd say, you know what, fellas?  I'd prefer if you didn't.  I don't know if that's going to work.  Yeah, I don't think so.  I ain't seen that shit work yet.  Well, how about this?  How about you give me another choice? 
[03:26:30]  How about, don't suck my dick, but you can have my desserts?  Yeah, how about, I don't need any.  Well, why can't they have it all, baby?  Sharing is caring.  Hey, you ever have sex with a woman?  Say that again?  Ever have sex with a woman?  Actually, I did twice.  I did twice.  Yeah?  And what was the problem?  You didn't like it?  Check it out.  You see that song I cut, Living in the Closet, man?  That fucking love song shit bullshit I did.  That Living in the Closet.  You know what I mean?  It's on the track, baby.  Yeah.  And I talk about it in there. 
[03:27:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  And I fucked with this chick.  The first one, you know, I was like fucking still a virgin.  And I tried to do it just to try to see, you know what I'm saying, if shit was in me or not.  And I fucking went with him.  My dick got softened.  I started feeling a little sick, man.  I couldn't fuck with it, man.  And I fucked around and I tried to eat it.  And it was too fucking tart or something.  You know, and it just fucked me up, man.  It was too tart.  I don't know.  It just didn't work for me, man.  And then I tried it again when I was a little older.  It just didn't work.  Hey, against the fact, how do you escape the old AIDS? 
[03:27:30]  What are you talking about, baby?  How do you escape the HIV?  Were you safe?  Focus back in terms for me, baby.  Say that again?  He's saying that he's assuming you're HIV negative, right?  Oh, fuck yeah.  So how did you do it in jail?  With rubbers or what did you do in jail?  Yeah, in jail, we got rubbers and pin to pin, man.  I ain't got front, not always.  I didn't always do it with the fucking rubbers.  Scott Lucky.  Right, right.  My shit is right.  But see, I would get fresh meat motherfuckers, and I like those clean cut motherfuckers, man. 
[03:28:00]  You know what I'm saying?  The professional motherfuckers that come in.  Those are the ones that I like.  And, you know.  Oh, jeez.  Some poor white collar crime guy.  They've never had dick before.  You know, and it's the same thing.  You know, the shitty motherfuckers.  I don't even like to fuck with, like, feminine faggots, man.  I don't fuck with that.  Well, we got a lot of questions coming in.  Rich in Philly wants to know if your gang colors are pink.  Nah, man.  That shit is glass with my shit.

I think people around the country are listening with their assholes puckered shut.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, clenching.  The manholes are getting wet right now.  I'm going to fucking speak, baby.

[03:29:00]  Which one?  Just give us a little something.  Which one we're in the tracks?  Anything.  Whatever you've been working on, maybe something.  Okay.  This is some shit that, you know, just to show motherfuckers that I can even switch it up on them.  All right?  And then get away from them fagg shit, baby.  Let me see, what can I get for you?  Lyrical precision with forms that has risen from the depths of my mind in time.  A new division of wrath that will extend and spell out a new meaning.  For those who haven't started, like Marvin, I just feed it.  For a new dimension of vision that I have made up.  And this is the reality, just telling it straight up.  Highly rated, complicated scenario.  My material displayed. 
[03:29:30]  And I tell you to wait.  No imperial address it.  And expressing the terms you can decipher.  Not revolting, just resulting in me being the life of the scene.  What I mean, the idea is unclear if you prevent that intent, which is meant for you to hear.  Opposition is a list and the cowards are overpowered.  But in the brief figure of speech, they get devoured.  A relentless attack, which is fact and submetly.  And actual fact is exact and sort of deadly.  What, son?  Nice.  What?  Yeah, boy.  The king fag is here, baby.  I see gangster fags settling down and having a family one day.  Uh, yeah.

I'm still high and my dick is still really hard.  Watch the male hookahs as I'm driving past.  Fuck that shit, I ain't paid for ass.  I make a U and I'm about to go home.  That's when my boy told me you were to say in the phone.  He says he got some guys hanging at the house.  They're talking lots of shit like they could turn me out.  I asked if they were fine and he said hell yeah.  I made a U-turn and told him I'd be there.  Rollin' on my D's now I'm on my way.

[03:35:00]  Yes, it's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The Opioid Inquiry Show.  In case you didn't know.  Running out of showtime.  Let's find Whip'em Out Wednesday.  Look at that.  We don't talk about wow often.

Women are out there and they're willing to flash you if they see that you have a wow sticker.  How's the traffic out of Manhattan?  Anybody?  Anyone?  Anyone?  No, it shouldn't be that bad because they stopped the HOV thing at 11.  Yeah.  So I think if I leave right away, I should be okay. 
[03:36:00]  You might be all right.  You'll be fine.  No traffic at all.  I hope so.  Kevin on Long Island, what did you learn on the Opioid Anthony show today?  Really?  That's wonderful.  Kev!

It's a 12-hour show that's just going to keep repeating.  Oh, my God.  I've got to wake the fuck up.  I've got to drive home.  I've been up since like 3 this morning.  Anthony.  Well, that's what you've got to do to drive in.  You know what I'll do?  I'll have you come over, and I'll give you a massage.  And then you wind up giving it to me good on my kid's bed.  He wants it.  That's what happened on Gangster Fag.  The guy said, let me give you a rub down. 
[03:41:00]  Wipe it off on your celebrity photos.  Oh, no.  Wipe it on my signed Tony I Homey picture.  That Aussie's sticky.  Let's go to John in New Jersey.  John.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I learned today that giving up my desserts wouldn't be enough.  Nope.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  And Mike in New York.  Mike.  Yeah, I learned all your interns are all pussies.  Wine and pussies.  That's all they are.  Who got what and who didn't get what?  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Stay tuned for the Ron and Fez show. 
[03:41:30]  They're up next.  They're great.  Give them a chance.  I think people are giving them a chance.  Love the Ron and Fez.  Of course.  They're building an audience.  They want it.  It's Ron and Fez next on this fine channel 202.  See you tomorrow.  Fez needs it.  Just a couple of minutes are pussies.  You'll be an Anthony show.  Karaoke. </pre>
