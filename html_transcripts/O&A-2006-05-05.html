<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show, hosted by Opie, Anthony, and James Norton (with frequent appearances from Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, E-Rock, Big A, and Twitchells), began with the hosts engaging in self-deprecating humor, insulting themselves and their crew.  William Donahue from the Catholic League was a guest early in the show.  A significant portion of the broadcast focused on "Lady Di," a recurring character struggling with alcoholism and homelessness.  The hosts detailed a failed intervention and rehab attempt, followed by a call from Marion, Lady Di's friend, expressing frustration.

The show then jumped between various topics: the absurdity of courtroom sketches, a distracting TV in their office, a nude photo of David Lee Roth, a discussion of Picasso's Cubism, a call from Colin Quinn promoting his play (about a cross-dressing gangster), a rambling call from Tara in Arizona, and Patrick Kennedy's drunk driving incident. Numerous crude jokes and comments were interspersed throughout.  A contest was promoted, involving $1000, mousetraps, and Tool concert tickets scattered on the studio floor.  The initial lack of female contestants led to more self-deprecating humor and a threat by Big A to participate in his underwear.  Bam called in with a Lady Di update.

A segment featuring Big A and Twitchells saw Heather from Canada connected with Big A, referencing a previous PowerTalk interaction implying sexually explicit content.  Big A's appearance was heavily mocked.  Twitchells' Tourette's Syndrome and an Almond Joy-induced vomiting incident (documented on their website) were discussed.  The hosts’ difficulties with female contestants in past contests were revisited, leading to another mousetrap contest proposal for Big A and Twitchells.  Big A’s "Week in Review" segment showcased his difficulty pronouncing words starting with "st." Listener calls included stories about a damaged dump truck and a Star Wars scene.  An "undercover" segment, “Shame on You,” showed bars serving underage drinkers. A postal worker's bizarre excuse for destroying mail ("too much mail") was also discussed.  Bobby, a producer, proposed a "gay chicken" contest (two blindfolded men approaching for a kiss), but the mousetrap contest remained the focus. The show plugged a radiothon for the Imus Ranch for Kids with Cancer.  Tension arose regarding the "gay chicken" contest’s potential origin from Howard Stern. Josh from ESPN Classic (now ESPN) called to promote the channel.

A later segment explored the subjective nature of humor and offensive jokes.  Bobby was punished for providing bad information by having to put his tongue in a mousetrap.  The mousetrap contest with Big A and Twitchells was executed, with Big A showing remarkable pain tolerance, while Twitchells suffered multiple trap strikes.  The planned addition of women in lingerie did not materialize.  The hosts discussed their "ONA pests" and their influence.  Josh Elliott from ESPN was a guest.  Jimmy Norton's repeated illness and graphic descriptions of his bowel movements were a running gag.  The planned mariachi band for their walk to another studio failed to appear due to a more lucrative gig. The second half featured more discussion of Norton's intestinal distress and a recording of his first call to the show.

A subsequent excerpt detailed FCC censorship leading to dumped segments. A rambling interview with Lady Di and her acquaintances involved graphic sexual descriptions and accusations. A discussion of "cougars" involved listener calls sharing their experiences.  A caller provided a graphic account of his relationship with Lady Di.  Jimmy Norton's severe food poisoning and numerous bathroom breaks were a significant event.  The segment on cougars featured listener calls and audio clips from the Today Show.  A bit referencing Charles Kuralt evolved into a sexually suggestive monologue. Bobby’s potential homosexuality was a recurring joke.

Another segment heavily featured speculation about Bobby's sexuality, combined with crude humor about bodily functions, particularly Jimmy's severe diarrhea and frequent bathroom breaks. Andrew Dice Clay was a guest (partially via phone).  A significant portion played a recording of Jim Norton's first call, featuring vulgar jokes and sexually explicit banter.  Freddy Rodriguez (from *Poseidon*) was interviewed, interspersed with Norton's first call and Jimmy’s bathroom trips. Listener calls covered various unrelated topics.  The hosts discussed a promotional contest and Opie and Anthony merchandise.  The show ended with more banter and sexually suggestive comments.

The final excerpt began with discussions of bowel issues and bad restaurant experiences, including a story about a Chinese restaurant serving questionable meat. The hosts discussed their upcoming appearance at Rich Voss' show, calling him “fucking hilarious”, and their ongoing feud with Richard Johnson of the New York Post, referring to a headline calling them "Dopey and Pervy Pal".  They planned to involve their "pests" to address this.  Callers, including Doug and Tom, shared anecdotes. Freddy Rodriguez briefly appeared promoting *Poseidon*; an upcoming interview with Richard Dreyfuss was mentioned.  The latter half showcased the hosts' exhaustion and Anthony's desire to leave, which became a running gag.  There was a discussion about Steve receiving a reprimand for inappropriate touching. The show ended with more banter, a miscommunication during a planned "heavy metal song" reveal, and continued jokes about Anthony's desire to leave, all while highlighting the hosts' fatigue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue, president of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before, and then you bounce back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambaste Opie and Anthony for the rest of my life?  I don't go around hoping clutches with people. You know, I move on. 
[00:00:30]  And, you know, I just wish you well. I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well.  Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! Shut up!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow! We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news. We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slumped fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chucky.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care! 
[00:01:30]  Shut up!  No!  What's wrong, Eric?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Ass.  Shut up!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is that so?  Who made you pulp in this dump, huh?  Ha ha ha! 
[00:02:00]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  We're tanks for nuttin'!  Ha ha ha ha!  Thanks for nuttin'.  Yeah.  It's Friday!  Friday!  It's Friday!  Good morning and welcome to the Opian Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Thanks to XM Satellite Radio and, of course, CBS Radio being heard in New York City, Philadelphia, 
[00:02:30]  Dallas, Boston, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and the home of EROC's parents, West Palm Beach,  Florida.  You're getting to the point where you're blurting those out pretty quick.  It's written right in front of me.  Oh.  I still get hung up on a few.  Do you?  I got that.  Oh, New York, Boston, Philly.  Um.  Um.  Oh, Cleveland.  I'm gonna.  I'm gonna.  I'm gonna.  We can go right.  You know, we can go right to the phone.  Sorry to interrupt you, Anthony. 
[00:03:00]  No interruption.  Marion is on the phone really fast.  Lady Di was in studio yesterday.  An old character from the old Opian Anthony show.  Uh.  She did a lot of great stuff for the program.  She was, um, part of the retarded Laverne and Shirley with her pal Marion, who's on the  line here.  She's fallen on hard times, amongst other things.  Uh, yeah.  She's homeless, living on the tracks behind a path mark somewhere in Jersey.  Yes.  Making love to the Railroad Romeo.  It came to a head yesterday. 
[00:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  We had her in studio.  A big, fat, bloated head with, uh, alcohol redness all over her nose and cheeks, by the way.  I believe we had an intervention yesterday.  Yeah.  It's just like how they do it on TV.  I think we're better at it.  There was a lot of love going on in the studio.  No, because there should be no love in an intervention.  It should just be berating somebody for their life choices.  Yeah.  People just yelling, quit drinking, you slob, you smelt.  Fat pig, everything.  Just, just, just lay into them. 
[00:04:00]  Well, I guess you're right.  So, um, we have to update.  This happened on the second part of the show yesterday.  Uh, when we left you guys on the first part of the show, Lady Di was on her way to rehab  with, uh, Bam, one of the ONA pests.  Yep.  He was driving her there.  She agreed to go to rehab, uh, with a lot of prodding for some reason.  It's the best thing that could possibly happen to her.  And, uh, she's like, well, I gotta talk to my, um, welfare person and this not understanding  that anybody who is in the services of trying to help people would absolutely go bend over 
[00:04:30]  backwards to help you if you went into rehab, but she doesn't see it that way.  She had to get back to Jersey, which means she had to get back to her booze and her train  tracks.  And, uh, yeah, Bam took her to the rehab.  In Yonkers.  In Yonkers.  And, uh, I, I said that she would last 12 hours.  12 hours.  I gave her three days.  I don't know why.  It hit me in the head.  And Jimmy?  I'm such a naive Nelly.  I'm like, you know what? 
[00:05:00]  She seemed ready.  Ready?  I don't know.  She seemed ready.  Ready for a shotgun in her mouth, perhaps.  Well, she said she would go.  She kind of nodded her fat head and she said she would go.  So I'm like, all right, maybe she's ready.  And we all, yeah, you thought she was at her bottom.  Yeah.  I guess not.  Yeah.  Because, uh, Lady Di lasted, uh, 15 minutes.  If that.  If that.  They were trying to, like, check her in.  And, uh, Bam brought her in there.  Uh, they were going to take her, run her through a seven-day detox, and then hook her up with 
[00:05:30]  some kind of counseling and maybe the 28-day deal that was going to go on.  And by that point, she'd have gotten in touch with her welfare people and everybody else.  And it could have worked out.  Uh, no.  She, she walked.  I believe she was given $7.  And at that point, she walked and decided, uh, you know, she was going to get some booze  and cigarettes.  And the reason why she walked, Bam left her in Yonkers.  Yeah.  Well, she asked Bam for a ride back to the train station after she got her seven bucks.  And Bam told her to go screw off. 
[00:06:00]  And, uh, that was it.  Who gave her seven bucks?  Uh, somebody at the rehab place.  So she could.  Why would you do that?  So she could get on a bus or something.  I don't know.  Uh, Marion.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, Jim.  Hey, thanks for trying, but I saw Diane last night.  Oh, you saw her?  Yeah.  Um, I yelled at her.  I screamed at her.  You don't even want to know what I said, because I can't say it.  But, um, I asked her what she did, why she did it.  And she said she just couldn't handle Yonkers.  I said, what the hell?  I said, what is wrong with Yonkers?  It's a place.  I said, yous are willing to help her? 
[00:06:30]  I said, and you know what?  Let me tell you something.  She just isn't ready.  And, you know, I appreciate what you guys did.  I try to do a lot.  You try to do a lot.  Another friend of ours is trying to do a lot.  But get it.  She's laughing and giggling.  She says to me, I'm sorry.  I said, I'm not the one that's an alcoholic.  I said, don't say sorry to me.  She's having the time of her life.  Oh, what a joy.  Let me tell you something.  I met the one guy that she hangs with.  This guy's all right.  This guy doesn't panhandle.  This guy's not at the track seven days a week like Diane is.  What is he? 
[00:07:00]  What is he, a corporate manager?  He's homeless living under the train tracks.  No, no, no.  Jim, Jim, he's not completely homeless.  He runs a hedge fund behind an actual bush.  No, the guy is not completely homeless.  And the guy doesn't panhandle.  He does odd jobs.  He helps people move.  He studies stuff like that.  It's called stalking and scoping out a crime.  You know who else did odd jobs and helped people?  Alex and Clockwork Orange.  Well, I don't know what this guy is.  Odd jobs, he helps people.  This guy is not a bad guy. 
[00:07:30]  But the other guy that Diane, the guy that leaves Diane on a train track, he needs to  be put away because he's the one that's making her do this.  All right, Marion, you got 30 seconds because it's way too early to deal with you.  I know, but I wanted to let you know that you wasted your time yesterday trying to get  her help because you...  No, we didn't.  We had great radio.  I listened to the replay.  That was no waste of time.  We had great radio.  We're not actually trying to help Lady Di.  I don't give a crap about Lady Di.  We just know it makes for good radio.  No, she thinks you're trying to help her. 
[00:08:00]  I want to see her get help, but you got to let her go.  You got to stop trying to help her.  No, I'm done.  I'm done.  Just stop going to see her.  Let her just do it.  You know what the truth of the matter is?  I would feel the same if she got help and got back on her feet and got back into life  again.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I would feel the same if she did that or fell asleep on the tracks and was cut into  three pieces.  She thought that you guys would set up a fund for her to get money to get drunk.  I would set up a fund to stitch your mouth shut whenever you call because you can't get 
[00:08:30]  a word in edgewise.  No, go ahead.  All right, Marion.  We're done with you.  When I talk to you guys...  The boy used to thank you for trying.  All right, Marion.  And to tell you that you wasted your time because all she did was leave and get drunk  again.  Yeah, of course she did.  And she still speaks better English.  And she's never going to get better.  Never.  Thanks for calling.  All right, Marion.  Thank you.  Okay.  Take care, guys.  Talk to you again.  Bye.  What a loudmouth, football-helmeted hair.  Nothing, Marion is. 
[00:09:00]  She's an ass.  She is a complete and total ass.  She's a Dr. Seuss character.  That's exactly what she is.  If you people ever get a chance to peruse some websites and find her picture, it is  just...  She has hair.  I swear it looks like a football helmet without the face mask on it.  That's what it is.  It's this curly, like bleached afro mullet. 
[00:09:30]  It's indescribable.  I'm trying.  It's actually...  It could be the worst hairdo I've ever seen.  A hairdo.  It's a hairdo, and it's abominable.  Yeah.  You could tell that, like, once a month, she goes to the parlor and has it done.  Hey, everybody.  E-Rock told Bam to call the show.  Bam, what's up?  Nothing much.  Just, you know, I don't know.  I was sleeping.  Someone text messaged me and told me to call in to recap if Lady Di. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Welcome to our world.  We kind of recapped yesterday.  You just dropped her off at Yonkers and said goodbye.  Yeah.  She's probably roaming the streets of Yonkers right now.  No one knows where she is.  No, apparently she made it back to the tracks because that's where Lady Marion found her  and had a little chat with her.  Right.  She was living the life of Riley.  The life of Riley.  Just drinking, partying, having fun.  Laughing, clinking glasses.  All right.  Bam, we got to go because we got a very busy show today. 
[00:10:30]  No problem.  Yeah, go back to sleep.  Yeah, go back to sleep.  We really didn't need you today.  On the show, we got Twitchels and Big A.  Huh?  I thought you said that.  We really didn't need you today.  Didn't need you.  Not at all.  Just woke you up for nothing.  Twitchels and Big A are going to do the news today once again.  Yeah.  Actually, like a week in review, I believe.  They're going to do it within the next half hour.  And, of course, we got the mousetraps.  Yes.  The mind of mousetraps.  We got tool tickets to give away.  Where's the pile of cash?  We got $500 cash we're going to throw on the floor. 
[00:11:00]  Do we have other prizes, too?  Ooh, look at that.  It should be all hundreds.  Bundled up.  Nice.  Five of them.  And the contestants are arriving?  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the contestants arriving.  We're going to hopefully do this in the 7 o'clock hour.  Basically, this whole studio, and it's a really big studio,  there's going to be at least 100 mousetraps on the floor,  maybe even more.  Yep.  And then we're going to throw all this money on the floor.  And then amongst the money and the mousetraps will be tickets to see Tool  and hopefully other prizes from Free FM here in New York City.  We tested it out yesterday on Stalker Patty, 
[00:11:30]  and I listened to the replay.  And, oh, my God, the sounds she was making.  She sounds just like a chimpanzee, like a chimpanzee being beaten.  And she's squealing and screaming.  And then when she was done, we were trying to guide her out of the minefield of mousetraps.  And we're like, all right, Patty, you're almost out.  You're almost out.  And she was about eight feet out already.  But these bastards kept picking up piles of mousetraps 
[00:12:00]  and just putting them in front of her as she was crawling on a path of mousetraps,  screaming with her ugly, gnarled, big toenailed feet.  Oh, what a disgusting human she is.  I really wanted to see her lose a toe yesterday.  I wanted her to be great and just see one of those toes come off.  Just snap right off.  How much trouble could we get in?  She's 51.  Yeah, what's one of her toes worth?  Nothing.  A couple hundred dollars.  Not even.  We'll give her a couple hundred.  I don't know if you're walking anywhere important.  All right, some other things that piqued our interest this morning 
[00:12:30]  as we were getting ready for the program.  We were watching the news, which has just become completely ridiculous.  I was all cranky.  I sleep well every other day because I guess this sleeping thing,  you've got to work it out, and it's almost impossible.  So one day I will just pass out pretty much at 6 p.m.  like I'm seven years old.  It's bitty-bye time, Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Bitty-bye time.  Grab your Yangi and go upstairs.  That's me again all over.  I remember when I used to be able to stay up.  I reached an age where I could stay up until 9 o'clock,  and I thought that was, you know, that's like the adult comparison is partying until 5.  And it had to work.  It was a progression when you were a kid, you know, 6, 6.30, 7.  Every year my parents would let me stay up a little later.  And I'm back to like 6.30 at night. 
[00:13:30]  It's bright out.  I hear kids playing outside, and I got to go to sleep.  Like a cancer patient.  Yeah, it's awful.  The chemo makes me tired.  I get tired.  See, I still make it to about 9, 9.30.  Some days it's a little earlier than that.  And, you know, I live in New York City, so I can hear people going to dinner.  The hustle and bustle, Opie.  Yeah, you hear them just walking to dinner.  They're living lives in what they're doing.  Are you crazy going to dinner?  It's bedtime.  Don't you understand that?  People trying to sleep here. 
[00:14:00]  But it's every other day because when I do that, I get many hours of sleep.  Right.  So that happened like the day before yesterday.  I went to sleep, woke up 4, whatever, and I was full of energy.  But then I get home, and I don't go right to sleep.  Now, last night I stayed up until almost 11 o'clock.  So, ooh, today, ooh, a little sleepy.  So I was a little cranky watching the news this morning.  And the news annoys me anyway, but this morning just especially.  They got that big, useless David Lee Roth television in our office. 
[00:14:30]  And it just gives you that much more of the news.  The thing is 9 feet wide.  I don't know why they're, boosy, boosy, bop.  I need a big TV.  Woo!  It's the biggest, most obnoxious flat screen television.  I've never seen a bigger flat screen.  Never.  In a small area.  It's a very small.  It's not like a tiny office, but it's not this grand office where this thing is 12 feet away for you to watch.  It's, quite frankly, giving us a sunburn.  It's about three feet away from us. 
[00:15:00]  And we're all cross-eyed.  We're all cross-eyed.  Cross-eyed.  What, Ben?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  I'm getting sunburned.  Yeah?  Thanks, Ben.  Nice.  Good joke, Ben.  That was terrific.  At least you didn't drop the F-bomb that time with it.  That was definitely worth wrecking the flow of the show.  I appreciate it.  I like the fact that Ben not only blurted it out, but he said it on the way over to the mic and at the mic.  Three strikes, you're out.  Three times.  He had faith in that one. 
[00:15:30]  He really did.  Anyway.  Jerky, no sense of humor, ass.  So we're watching the big flat screen, David Lee Roth TV.  Yeah.  And the one thing that was really funny was the courtroom sketch thing.  It was just annoying.  And Anthony, you know, I've been watching, you know, like anyone else, and you see the courtroom sketch on the news, and you think nothing of it.  But then Anthony finally brought it to my attention, saying, why the hell in 2006 are we still using courtroom sketches?  We got cameras.  There's cameras. 
[00:16:00]  Why are we looking at someone's rendition, someone's painting of a courtroom scene?  When they say it's for privacy or something, but you see these people on the street, they take pictures and video of them walking into the courtroom, walking out of the courtroom, at home with their lawyers.  But for some reason, in the courtroom, you've got to have this pastel painting, pictures done of them.  And there's no reason for it. 
[00:16:30]  What is it?  Then let them have to do it when they're walking out of the courtroom or at home or when it's anyone else.  They shove cameras in people's face every day for crimes that they might have or might not have committed.  They go into restaurants and say, your restaurant is filthy.  We went around with this camera, and they show the owner going, I'm trying to clean up my job.  I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to high up.  Why don't that guy get a nice pastel?  Right.  Of what that, it's 2006. 
[00:17:00]  Put the cameras in the courts.  And by the way, the phones are going crazy.  We don't need the answer to that question.  We just think it's stupid and silly.  Was someone actually going to offer an answer?  Yeah, why they use courtroom sketches instead of real pictures.  If I really cared, I'd look it up somewhere.  I don't care.  All I know is that on the outside, it's ridiculous.  It's 2006.  Yeah.  There's no more reasons to paint to see somebody.  It's not 1850. 
[00:17:30]  No.  We understand back in 1850, that was the way to get someone's picture.  Even though probably in 1850, they already had cameras, right?  That's some kind of, right around there, I think.  I think it was like kind of, the Civil War really kind of was the big turning point of the camera.  Before that, you know, Napoleon, okay?  You're not going to find any photos of Napoleon.  It was, it was a long, totally deep.  What is that and where did you find it? 
[00:18:00]  Here, Ben's back on the mic.  Ben is just contributing to the show like crazy.  Ben's on fire day.  Al has that hanging above his desk.  I guess David had this on his door.  He did.  It's a, is that a, is that a nude?  It's a nude David Lee Roth photo.  But he's strategically seated in a chair.  He's wearing some kind of G-string.  He's strategically seated in a chair that's backwards covering any vitals.  And, yeah, he is nude.  You could tell there's a fan blowing from one side and his hair is going, what year was 
[00:18:30]  this taken?  Way to hog the picture, Ant.  I can't take my eyes off of it.  There you go, Jim.  Ooh.  I mean, that's cool.  Why would you, why would you bring this into work?  And that's got to be from what, like 78 tops?  Come on.  It would be much more entertaining if he took a current picture that way.  By the way, I think about paintings and photos.  Picasso sold for $95 million.  Yeah?  Did you see that abomination of the painting? 
[00:19:00]  Picasso stinks.  He doesn't stink.  I don't like it.  Some of his stuff stinks.  I'm a big Pablo Picasso fan.  Dude, I'm trying to enjoy, I'm looking at the picture.  He had periods, Jim.  He had periods.  Yes, on canvas.  He sold them.  No, that was called the red period, I believe.  And then he had his.  No, you guys are laughing, I know.  And they're probably dumping out.  But Pablo Picasso actually had a stage of his career called the red period.  Did he?  Or something like that.  And then the blue.  It was the blue.  And then he had the blue period.  He needed the money. 
[00:19:30]  Oh!  And what you're referring to is when all of a sudden he decided to draw and paint where,  you know, he had the person's ear on the forehead.  Yeah, that period.  Right, well, that is the period that got awful.  But that's his most popular period.  Dude, that's the one that sold.  It's called Such and Such with Cat.  It's a lady sitting there with like a half a face and an ear.  Remember Billy Connolly yesterday described the shotgun?  A square nose.  It looks like she shot herself in the face and didn't do it right. 
[00:20:00]  That's what the head looks like.  She had a hiney face.  A face like a hiney.  Yes.  An awful black cat.  Kev?  Yes, big Kev.  It's the cubism period.  Cubism.  Cubism.  Is it cubism?  Yes, yes, yes.  Cubism, where everything is.  What does that mean?  Also known as the ugh period.  Because everything was kind of cubed.  Like cubic.  And I understand that he's like an impressionist or whatever.  Not is.  No, that period.  He's blonde.  I'm telling you, man.  If you look at...  Have you ever seen...  What's the famous painting called?  Old Guitars or something like that?  I think it's...  In the blue period.  In the blue period. 
[00:20:30]  You ever see that?  I think...  Like, I want that from my apartment.  It's just a real...  Good luck.  What?  Buying it.  No.  To me, I'll buy a copy.  Who cares?  A print from a poster shop.  Who's going to know the difference?  But it's a great piece of work.  We're going to know the difference.  Oh, you've got a Picasso, Opie.  A $30 frame on a Picasso hangover mouse droppings.  Spaghetti sauce splashed on the bottom of the frame.  It's...  You know, that stuff I like.  I think I know the stuff you mean.  Like, he was a great painter, but... 
[00:21:00]  When we go to break, I'm going to Google old guitars.  And I bet you, you would even want it for your apartment.  It's a really old guy still trying to create on a guitar.  It's a great piece of work.  I like Rockwell.  It looks like real people.  There's the old man.  There's the little fella running away from home.  Yeah, where was the last time you were in a soda shop?  The doctor and the stethoscope.  It's not real.  There's no soda shops anymore.  And the little kid, and you look and you go,  that stethoscope seems cold.  Yes.  Just from his expression.  The older gentleman and the negro.  I think that was a painting. 
[00:21:30]  You know, back in those days, times were different.  Right.  The police department and the fire hoses.  Sorry, it wasn't the red period.  It was the pink slash rose period.  Oh, it was?  I call it the red period.  Of course it is.  Hey, we got to say hi to Colin Quinn.  Colin.  Guys, I'm just calling because I wanted to say that my two cents on Marion's haircut.  Oh, okay.  Marion's haircut.  Did it take us off the speakerphone, you lazy F?  I'm not on speakerphone.  No? 
[00:22:00]  Oh, then you got a really bad phone.  No, I just wanted to say it's Dennis DeYoung.  It's an English judge from the Middle Ages.  Or it's a wreath at a funeral.  He knows what to punch out, Phil.  It is all those things.  Colin's play, by the way.  I'm going to give it a plug.  I wish I had the information.  It's about trannies.  And it's Sunday night on a play on 42nd Street between 9th and 10th. 
[00:22:30]  That's all I remember, Kyle.  I wanted to give it a plug.  God, I want to go to that.  Do they have an early showing?  I don't know what time it is.  I think it's actually 8 o'clock on Sunday.  Colin Quinn is playing Caroline's all weekend long.  He's also, yeah, at Caroline's here in New York.  I'm going tonight.  I'm going to go check him out.  Yeah, a bunch of us are going to go check out Colin this weekend.  Tara in Arizona, what's up?  Not much.  It's 321 in Arizona.  Oof.  So, as far as staying up until 6.30 and stuff, jeez.  Shut up. 
[00:23:00]  I just asked my brother, what time is it?  321?  I'm like, no.  Yeah, well.  That's kind of crazy.  What's going on, Tara?  What's on your mind?  Is she listening to it?  Tara, stop listening to yourself.  Tara, stop listening to the radio and talk.  Come on, you drunk.  The only reason you're up this late is because you're drinking, right?  No, I actually haven't drank in quite a long time.  But I can actually say to you, it'd be neat if you guys came out on the West Coast and did the mousetrap thing. 
[00:23:30]  Wow, you're really confused.  You call with one subject.  You talk about something we don't quite really get.  You're listening to the radio.  So, this is what we call a bad call, Tara.  I hope there's a pinball machine in your future.  I want to thank Tara for stopping the flow.  And thanks for making people actually look forward to the commercials. 
[00:24:00]  Good one.  Thank you, Arizona.  Wake up there, Tara.  Yeah, call us when you wake up, okay?  Will do.  Or maybe you should start drinking, so this is more entertaining.  We knew Tara was going to stink when she said, sheesh.  When somebody says, sheesh, it's not going to be an entertaining or sexy phone call.  Sheesh.  Yeah.  Well, she wanted to discuss that the red period was awful.  Oh, good.  Tara, say that now.  Talk about that.  Tara. 
[00:24:30]  Why are we still trying?  Oh, do I hate her.  Why are we still trying?  Go ahead, Tara.  Give it a whirl.  Why don't you?  Oh, can I not stand this woman?  Okay, never mind.  Never mind.  I hate you.  I hate you.  I hate you.  All right.  We're out of here.  Nathaniel, thank you.  Well, well, what?  Colin's play is called All Dialed Up, and it's at the 410 West 42nd Street, 212-279-4200.  It's about a true story of a cross-dressing gangster. 
[00:25:00]  I really want to see that.  I think it's the Acorn Theater.  Oh, okay.  All right, cool.  Listen, let's take our first break.  When we get back, hopefully Twitchels and Big A, are they ready to do the week in review?  Yeah, bring those.  All right.  If you haven't heard Twitchels and Big A yet, for the people that haven't heard us in a long time,  stick around.  Trust me on this one, okay?  It's unbelievable, and they do the news for us, but it's not about them doing the news.  You'll see what it's all about in a few minutes.  Also, we'll talk about Patrick Kennedy and his little smash-up.  Oops.  Just like dear old dad. 
[00:25:30]  Just like dear old dad.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  If you're trying to get a hold of us, 1-866-313-FREE.  Call the Opie and Anthony show right now.  866-313-FREE.  That's 866-313-FREE.  The phone lines are going berserk.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  What's happening?  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  We like to call it the O-8 virus. 
[00:26:00]  Still waiting for our contestants to show up, Anthony.  Hey.  We might have scared people away when we tried out the mousetrap thing with Stalker Patty.  Damn it.  They were supposed to arrive at 6.  It's what?  6.35.  Not a sign that a contestant is here.  Not one contestant has arrived yet.  We got tool tickets.  We got $500 in cash. 
[00:26:30]  And other prizes from Free FM here in New York City.  So I don't know what's going to happen with that.  866-313-FREE.  If you want to get a hold of us, 866-313-FREE.  In just a moment here, we got Big A and Twitchels doing the Week in Review.  Didn't some broads say they were showing?  Yeah.  Some broads?  They all said they were showing.  Yeah.  They better show.  It's cash. 
[00:27:00]  We might have to just drag some of the listeners off the street to do this.  Cold hard cash.  Cold hard cash at Ticket to See Tool.  And tool tickets.  Here in New York City.  You want to see Tool?  We should talk about the Patrick Kennedy thing.  And then we'll get into Big A and Twitchels.  Here's the news story.  I never ask for any preferential treatment.  Can you receive a team?  That's up for the police to decide.  And I'm going to cooperate fully with them.  That was Rhode Island Congressman Patrick Kennedy, son of Ted Kennedy,  and possibly the least impressive person in Washington, by the way,  commenting on an early morning car wreck that has raised some suspicion in the capital city. 
[00:27:30]  Police say the younger Kennedy appeared intoxicated, drunk, loaded, smashed,  after he crashed into a concrete barrier at about 2.45 in the morning.  The lawmaker claims he had taken sleep medication, Ambien,  as well as a prescription anti-nausea drug that can cause drowsiness.  He said he was so disoriented he believed he was going to the capital for a vote at 2.45 in the morning.  No field sobriety tests were conducted, so we don't really know.  The accident happened near Capitol Hill. 
[00:28:00]  Patrick, not hurt.  Can you believe no field sobriety tests?  Why would the stupid cops, if they didn't test him, say he appeared intoxicated?  Yeah.  How dumb are they to go,  Oh, you look drunk.  Would you test him?  No.  No.  No.  He said that he was under medication,  so we just let him go.  Try that trick at home, people.  If you ever get pulled over, if you ever crash into something, drunk,  just tell the cops you're taking some cold medication, 
[00:28:30]  and you're a little sleepy or nauseous or whatever,  and they'll let you go every time.  It happens every time.  They just let, okay, well, you're free to go.  This Kennedy family just gets away with murder.  The car didn't look that bad, by the way.  No?  It was, nah.  You see, where you just kind of tap it?  It was kind of a fender bender.  But still, because I heard it was totaled.  Nah.  His car was totaled.  They said he could have drove the car, 
[00:29:00]  but they decided to give him a ride home.  Give him a ride home?  Like the old days?  Right.  God, it's just amazing.  I don't know.  If you pin somebody up against the wall,  sorry, I took a fisherman's friend.  They, I don't know.  Maybe they're just getting some good things happening to him  after so many bad things in the family.  I mean, you get a couple of brothers and uncles, whatever,  getting their heads blown off.  Ah, you get away with a few things. 
[00:29:30]  They've gotten away with enough.  Please.  It goes back to the father running booze.  Guy made his fortune running bootleg liquor.  That's how the Kennedys got enough money  to put their kids in power.  Put JFK in power.  That's where that money came from.  From him running booze, the father.  And then the scandals with the retarded daughter  and the lobotomy and the abortions. 
[00:30:00]  Unbelievable.  The Kennedy screwing everybody scandal.  And then Ted driving off the bridge  and deciding to go home.  I guess he was on Ambien and some nausea medication  when he drove that girl into a lake,  into the river, and then just went home.  And so was Skakel.  He was on Ambien because he thought  it was actually a golf tee  when he was swinging at Martha Moxley.  I almost tripped on Martha Moxley.  It's a tough one to get out before.  Marthle.  Marthle.  Marthle.  Mush mouth, sweetheart.  Yeah.  Clubbed her with a golf club. 
[00:30:30]  What a family.  And then don't forget about the uncle  and with the other one, Kennedy Smith there.  Yeah.  On the lawn with the girl and the rape.  With the blue dot on her face.  The blue dot.  Remember the blue dot when she testified?  Yeah, that was Kennedy's blue rape period,  I believe, when they were using the blue dot  to cover the defendant.  Just awful family this is.  And Ted can do no harm.  I saw him, the last time I saw him  was on, I guess, The Daily Show or something. 
[00:31:00]  They were doing an interview with him.  I mean, he just, you know, he looks like Lady Di,  the big bloated Kennedy head.  He's just got nothing to say.  He's the head of a castrated party, the Democrats.  The way the Republicans are screwing up so badly,  you would think that somebody over there  could take charge.  And this guy's like the patriarch of the Democrats.  And he is just a waste.  Dude, how do they not beat the Republicans?  I mean, the Nazis or the Whigs  could beat the Republicans right now,  how horribly they're acting.  Is the Whig Party still active? 
[00:31:30]  It should be.  Because I want to register as a Whig.  You ought to have Marion as their logo.  Horrid head.  Hey, let's say hi to Dr. D.  What's up, Dr. D?  This is a callback for the XM fans.  The sequel to Ted Kennedy's game  of trying to drive across the bridge.  Now you're playing Patrick Kennedy.  Try to drive to Capitol Hill  without running into concrete abutments.  Do you know... 
[00:32:00]  All right, Jim.  All the time I've known Opie and Anthony,  I've never hated a caller as much  and I just hated what you did.  Oh, well, it's my first bomb.  How do we know it's your first bomb, sir?  How do we know?  I'm sure you bomb like that awful impression every day.  You sound like a pro-bomber.  One person at a party five years ago  told you you kind of sound like him  and he hasn't stopped doing it since.  Awful material with an awful impression.  Yeah, do you think I really sound like him?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, wow. 
[00:32:30]  You should call the Opie and Anthony program.  They would love that.  But it's like he does it at the office  and they're like,  wow, that's kind of cute.  And then he doesn't stop doing it  and they're like, all right, we get it.  All right, we get it.  You kind of sound like the guy.  Dial in the phone.  I'm going to call them.  You know, this might be my break.  Him, him, him.  I might be able to call in as the Kennedy guy.  Dr. D, you still there?  Yes, sir.  All right.  He's a trooper.  All right, thanks, sir.  Hey, Dave Johnson from North Carolina.  Kenny was stated as saying no drunko, 
[00:33:00]  so that's okay now.  Oh, all right.  He told the cop no drunko,  so everything's all right.  Cop goes, you look drunk.  No drunko.  No drunko.  Oh, well, you're free to go.  Of course, that is a reference to no homo.  And Bobby is here, right?  Bobby.  Bobby is here.  He created this game  that no one wants to play except him, by the way.  It's not even a game.  It's an excuse.  Yeah.  It's like some kind of alibi  for doing something that is a little off  as far as men go. 
[00:33:30]  Men don't like to just be touched.  There's this whole hugging thing  that's been going on the past few years.  A lot of people hug now.  It's a way of getting out of handshakes, I think, though.  I think people are less comfortable shaking hands.  Yeah.  So I think they're hugging a little bit more.  Screw that.  A man kissed Anthony yesterday.  But he was English or Scottish.  Scottish.  So that's okay?  Yeah.  No, not really.  It was hot.  The way you just sat there and took it like a victim.  I really did.  A button-pushing victim? 
[00:34:00]  On the second half of the program yesterday,  we had Billy Connolly.  Billy Connolly is hysterical.  He was really, really funny.  We'll bring him in here  to the first half of the Opium Athlete program  in the near future,  because he was great.  Right.  He loved our show,  loved our sense of humor.  He's like,  what did he say?  He goes,  your show is brilliant.  You hate your listeners.  I've never seen anything like it.  He loved the fact that we were just berating everybody  that called in that day. 
[00:34:30]  And trashing them.  But at the end of his appearance,  we're still on air,  and he had to leave, I guess,  and he got up  and he just decided to kiss Anthony on the cheek.  I'm broadcasting,  and he leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.  I don't know if that's a Scottish thing,  but somebody quick on the draw,  thank you,  I don't remember who it was,  gave me my Purell,  which I promptly bathed with.  I mean, I don't know.  He seems like a clean enough,  nice enough guy.  But I don't like men touching me,  nonetheless. 
[00:35:00]  He didn't even say no homo.  So I don't know what that means.  Well, you were scrubbing your face  for the rest of the program.  Yeah, I had the Purell,  and I was rubbing it into my cheeks.  Dude, I heard a lot of our guests  love people on this show.  I mean, that was just what I heard yesterday.  What?  Oh, Jimmy can't get enough of this.  This annoys the hell out of me.  I don't know.  I'm just speculating.  This bugs me to no end.  We had Edward Norton on yesterday.  Why don't we bring Roland in here?  Who's doing Conan tonight, by the way, I think.  Is he?  Yeah.  Wow, he did our show,  and then Conan. 
[00:35:30]  That's not bad, huh?  Look at our boss on TV.  Yeah, Joel Hollander.  Joel Hollander's on Imus again.  Imus.  We'll never see Joel Hollander again.  We had a secret meeting with him  at the Ritz-Carlton.  He signed us up for this crazy gig,  and we haven't seen him since.  I think we will.  I don't think we'll ever see him again.  We'll see him when we finally screw up again.  But he liked us.  Roland, so you got Edward Norton  on our show yesterday.  It went very well.  A coup.  It was the only radio he was doing, huh? 
[00:36:00]  It was the only radio show he was doing,  and his rep said that he loved Jimmy.  Jimmy cracked him up a lot.  That's great.  Loved Jimmy.  Let me tell you something.  Why did it bug the hell out of me?  I did email everybody and say,  should we tell you this?  I'm very happy.  No.  It bugs me because I'm a huge fan of Edward Norton.  I don't think you meant it for me.  No, I hate you.  I love his work.  It's great.  His movies.  And the fact that he even knew who you were 
[00:36:30]  bugged me all night long.  You know what it is?  Here's what it is.  When men enjoy each other's work,  Edward and I do,  sometimes we'll bond on a radio program.  You're like the jester to him.  You're someone to make him laugh  with the curly shoes with the bells on him.  You're not an equal.  You're not a colleague.  I'm a contemporary.  No, you're not a contemporary.  You're clown shoes. 
[00:37:00]  He thinks of people when he talked about De Niro.  He also called him Bob.  Remember we referred to De Niro as Bob?  Yeah, only when he called him Bob,  Bob listened, talked, worked with him.  When you touched De Niro's arm and said,  looked in his eyes like a puppy,  went, Bob, at some function you weren't supposed to be at  to try to get his picture  and was promptly shooed away.  That's the Jimmy Norton we know,  not the one that is trying to build up this relationship  with Edward Norton.  De Niro would have reacted better 
[00:37:30]  if I threw Arthur Ashe's blood on his forearm.  You've never seen anybody turn away quicker  and more unhappily than De Niro did when I kicked him.  That's the reaction I want celebrities to give you.  I don't like this, oh, Jimmy Norton,  and then he didn't even know he was talking to him.  You listen to the interview, I listen to the playback,  and he goes, oh, Jimmy Norton, that guy's hysterical.  Like we were just talking about him.  Had no idea that Jimmy Norton was, you know,  part of the show.  Yeah, exactly.  And then what really annoyed me was when he said,  why didn't anyone tell me you were part of the show 
[00:38:00]  that I was calling into?  Which made me feel even lower on the rung  than Jimmy Norton.  Well, you know what it is?  It's almost like, because then he quoted one of the bits.  It's like, you know, I'll quote Edward's bit,  he'll quote my thing.  All right, all right, all right, shut up.  Celebrities getting to know each other.  You can't even know how annoyed I was all night.  That bugged me.  Thank you.  By the way, Roland, who's on the show today?  Freddy Rodriguez in the XM Hour.  Oh, in the XM Hour.  Oh, in the XM Hour.  Is he a potty mouth?  Is that the problem? 
[00:38:30]  No.  Potty mouth?  He's in the new movie, Poseidon.  Poseidon Adventure, yeah.  Poseidon Adventure.  Yeah, it's just called Poseidon.  They have to change the title of the movies  when they remake them these days.  Just tweak them a little.  The adventure thing is so 70s, Irwin Allen,  and now it's just Poseidon.  I wonder if part of that, though,  and believe me, I hate the remakes.  Do you think, like, Kong and stuff like that  has something to do with the fact  that they want you to be able to know  which one you're getting real quick?  Like, if you want to look it up,  you can just go Kong instead of King Kong.  Which King Kong is this?  I'm sure.  If you put it in IMDb, though,  it comes up both,  no matter what you put in, Poseidon, Poseidon Adventure. 
[00:39:00]  But I like how TV tries to fool you.  Like, when Poseidon comes out,  guaranteed there'll be 15 stations,  TBS, all those awful commercial TV stations,  will have the Poseidon Adventure on,  hoping to fool people into thinking,  it's on TV already?  And you turn it on,  and there's that fat pig having a heart attack  as she's pulling a rope through some water.  Horrid.  Hey, we have a movie for the time,  but we haven't...  We haven't dated.  We also have a Tony Bennett update  talking about celebrities and stuff. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  We've scared him even more.  See, every morning when we finish the first half  of the Opian Anthony program,  we start the second half of the program  by broadcasting live from here to there,  to XM.  Yeah.  And the last couple of mornings,  we've run into Tony Bennett.  Yesterday, explain the move he made  to avoid us, like the plague.  Well, we were waiting on the corner to cross.  Got to wait for the walk sign. 
[00:40:00]  And we're standing on one corner,  and then the walk sign comes,  and across the crosswalk comes Tony Bennett.  And we're ready to cross right past him  in the crosswalk,  so we wait on the corner for him.  He doesn't even stay in the crosswalk.  He cut about mid-street  and just started walking in the middle of 57th Street.  To Tony Bennett,  to avoid having to even pass by us.  He now knows us.  He now looks and knows that we're a problem 
[00:40:30]  to be avoided at all costs,  even getting hit by a truck.  Maybe because club saw the Kenny went,  okay, and then lunges towards him.  Tony!  Tony!  Tony Bennett!  Tony Bennett!  Just blowing up his spot.  He's trying to be discreet.  Tony Bennett!  Sinatra's favorite singer!  Tony!  Isn't it like a track suit?  Yeah, trying to look not like Tony Bennett.  And now he's pretty much sprinting to avoid us.  Yeah, an old man  running down the middle of 57th Street to avoid us. 
[00:41:00]  We want to be nice to him, too.  We don't want to bother Tony Bennett.  He doesn't know that.  We got...  Well, didn't we also have someone in diapers at the time?  No.  That wasn't diaper day?  This was just yesterday.  Yesterday.  See, I get confused as to what day it is.  Yeah, no, but we get no respect.  Tony Bennett's very scared of us.  Tony Bennett does not want to do it.  All we want to do is a quick interview on the street with him as we broadcast live from  this studio to the other studio.  What's his big hit?  Left by Hart and Sanford.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  Come on.  Have him sing that on the streets of New York?  Come on. 
[00:41:30]  Wouldn't that be great?  But you're not going to have him do that.  No.  By the way, it's Cinco de Mayo today, so we got a mariachi band.  Oh, that's the tie-in.  I was wondering why the hell we had a mariachi band following us.  Yeah, we got a mariachi band following us today when we broadcast live after we finished  the first part of the Opie and Anthony show.  There's some stupid parade or anything today in Manhattan, is there?  I don't know.  Do they celebrate this?  I don't know.  Because I know when they do the Dominican Day or Puerto Rican Day.  Nah, they had their celebration a few days ago. 
[00:42:00]  Was that at the immigration parade?  That was Uno de Mayo.  Yeah.  They had a lot of fun on Uno de Mayo.  Anyway.  Cinco de Mayo.  Yeah, no one really celebrates that, do we?  Thanks.  Have a little corona after work.  Yeah, we'll do something.  But the band's going to be playing.  And what's weird about the walk, more and more people are showing up every day.  Yeah.  It's becoming a thing.  Yeah, it's kind of a hang with the show as we walk over to the other studios. 
[00:42:30]  All right, let's go to Chris on Long Island.  Chris, what's up?  Oh, not Long Island.  Lawrence Mass.  Oh, Lawrence Mass.  Steve, hi, honey.  Hi.  Who?  Chris.  I'm saying hi to Steve.  Steve, what's going on?  Who's Steve?  I just wanted to welcome you guys back to the show.  Back to Boston.  All the girls are drunk.  Yes, I'm drunk.  Thank you.  Hi.  I just wanted to welcome you guys back.  The show is awesome.  I finally get to hear Steve on the radio. 
[00:43:00]  What?  And I just think it's great.  I don't know.  Ben's freaking out.  Ben's running in like Rodney Dangerfield.  What are you talking about?  I have no idea.  Hey, huh?  Hey.  It was a freaking embarrassment.  Hey, perhaps there's a problem.  What?  But, uh, so, um, so Steve?  Mm-hmm.  Mm.  All right, Chris.  Nope.  I just wanted to welcome you guys back.  David Lee Roth sucked.  It was horrible listening to him, and I wish I had XM. 
[00:43:30]  That's your opinion, miss.  Yes, this is my opinion.  This is Steve, by the way.  Hi, Steve.  How long has it been since you listened to me?  How long has it been since I listened to you?  Yes.  Well, if this is really Steve talking, it was a couple of weeks ago, but...  No, I don't get any radio stations at work.  No?  I only have you guys 15 minutes on my way into work.  Or...  Well, are you enjoying the show at least?  This girl's delusional.  I'm going on the record.  All right, Chris. 
[00:44:00]  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony program.  We're off to a great start.  Are the contestants here for the mousetrap thing?  Not a one.  What?  No contestants.  No contestants?  Oh, my...  Yeah, people were a big radio program.  It's cold, hard cash.  Danny called a couple of them.  A couple of them said they're not coming now.  After Travis called them all last night, so...  Wait, what's their excuses?  They don't really have one.  I also tried calling my stepbrother's girlfriend to come back.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:44:30]  Oh, my God.  Is this pathetic?  Nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed.  Oh, my God.  You know, as we move forward, if you say you're going to come down here, you've got to come  down here.  If you're not going to come down here, just tell us.  That's fine.  We didn't give the speech.  You're right.  We used to give the speech.  Why would you say you're coming down to the show and then not show up?  I'll be down, dude.  Me, my chick, we're coming down.  And then just no excuse? 
[00:45:00]  All right.  Here's the deal.  It's as simple as this.  We have $500 in cash.  Yeah.  What?  What?  We'll double the money.  Oh.  Tom Chiasano just said he'll double the money.  I'll crawl around naked for Tool.  I know.  All right.  We're all going to crawl around naked then.  If one person shows up, they just take a little bit of mousetrap pain and you got yourself  a grand and tickets to Tool.  We just got the word from Tom Chiasano.  We're doubling the money. 
[00:45:30]  We now have $1,000 in cash that we're going to throw all over the studio.  We have over 100 mousetraps all over the studio.  We got the Tool tickets to see Tool here in New York City all over the studio.  All you have to do is come in.  You're blindfolded and you try to find the Tool tickets and on the way you can pick up  a lot of cash.  How sad is it that Tom has to come in and double the money to get us people?  It makes us really feel good about ourselves.  Yeah.  We're going places with this program. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, my God.  We are going places.  Tell him we'll pick him up.  We're going to be number one in morning radio by next week.  In no time.  It's so obvious.  Oh, my God.  He had to actually come in here and say we'll double the money.  Well, here's the deal, man.  We need five contestants.  It's got to be girls, though.  It's got to be girls.  Five women.  So, guys, get your ladies down here.  The first five to show up will be in the contest, and you're going to win a lot of great stuff,  okay?  I have a feeling any minute now. 
[00:46:30]  I think six was a little too early.  You think?  Any minute now, the phones are going to light up with people going, hold on.  I'm on my way.  Ben, where should they show up?  40 West.  Yeah.  40 West 57th Street.  All right.  Very good.  And what's the number, just in case somebody out there who's new may want to come on in?  Give the number.  Maybe we'll get a call from some people that are going to come in.  We'll know when they're coming and to expect them.  Well, the first five to get here.  Roll out the red carpet.  First five to get here.  866-313-FREE. 
[00:47:00]  866-313-FREE.  The number just went way up.  It's going to be...  The money just went way, way up.  It's going to be $1,000 in cash on the floor.  Yeah.  In the minefield of mousetraps today, okay?  When we get back, it's Big A and Twitchels doing the Week in Review on the Opian Anthony  program.  Ah, an exquisite day for mailbox baseball.  Need a mint. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, my.  Ramon, scoop up these puppy guts.  Opian Anthony.  Weekday mornings.  You're checking out the Opian Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Tom Ciasano has returned with more money for our mousetrap bit.  It's so sad.  I think he's feeling sad for us today. 
[00:48:00]  He knew this was our first big, huge, huge thing to do in the studio.  Yeah.  Here at Free FM in New York City.  A giveaway.  And, well, none of the contestants have shown up.  Not one contestant has shown up.  And I think we blew it yesterday by having Stalker Patty try out the whole thing.  Yeah.  And we abused her so bad in the minefield of mousetraps that I think it scared everyone  off.  But there are people that want and need money and want to go to see Tool.  And there were people yesterday on the phone. 
[00:48:30]  We were sure they had called up, said they were showing.  Yeah.  And now where are they?  Ben is in his glory.  Ben's got the giggles.  He's the executive producer of the show.  So I guess he finds it's very funny that none of the contestants showed up when it's on  him in the end.  Yeah.  If the contestants don't show up.  But he's just having a ball back there.  Do you know what we are with the contest?  We're Peter Brady looking for a party.  Yeah.  And where is it? 
[00:49:00]  That's exactly what we are.  Nowhere.  Our little heads poke up.  Contestant?  Surprise?  No.  Well, we're just looking for five listeners, five girls to crawl around in the minefield  of mousetraps, feeling around for tool tickets, feeling around for over, well, $1,000  in cash and other prizes.  So you're going to go away with some cool stuff.  And culvert cash.  So the first five women to show up will do the minefield of mousetraps today.  Were we being a little overzealous one weekend, thinking that after one week? 
[00:49:30]  We couldn't help ourselves.  We got too excited.  We had Stalker Patty do it yesterday.  I'm telling you, I think it's feeling all good.  It only hurts for a little while, and then you're fine, and then you'll walk out of here  with a lot of money.  A lot of money.  Yeah.  And tool tickets.  At this point, anyone that shows up, or if you show up, you're going to get tool tickets.  Right.  I mean, how many ladies out there have been on a date, and you've got to bite the pillow  and be a trooper to get what you want?  How many of you want?  If you want jewelry, balloon knot time. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  All right.  Ladies.  Toughen up.  You know what?  We're going to have to punish the listeners.  Yeah.  If five women do not show up for this contest, Big A will be crawling around in the minefield  of mousetraps in his tighty-whities.  And that punishes the listeners how?  After Club Soda Candy gives him a wedgie.  Oh, great.  Yeah, boy.  That's showing those listeners.  Well, we'll get video of it, and that's what you'll see. 
[00:50:30]  The first thing you'll see if you click on any of our websites tonight.  Personally drive to their houses and play it for them?  Well, just the awfulness that'll come through the radio will be punishment enough.  Speaking of Big A, we got Big A and Twitchell's in studio.  Big A, you have Heather on the line from Canada.  Who's Heather?  Talk to Big A online.  He said, oh, okay. 
[00:51:00]  What'd he say?  Little amore.  Are you trying to hook up?  Of course he is all the time online.  Big A looks like a cartoon character that came to life.  Wow, that nailed it.  Yeah, something like a Homer Simpson or a Fred Flintstone.  Like, only a cartoon could have a body like that, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, it's just out of proportion in strange areas.  He's Dr. Vile. 
[00:51:30]  Heather, what's up?  Not very much, boys.  How y'all doing?  Heather calling from Canada.  Yes, sir.  Big A told you to call the show?  Yes, he did.  Why?  To talk?  I don't know.  Go ahead, Big A.  What do you got to say?  Heather's on the line.  I was just talking with her on PowerTalk.  Oh, boy.  She told me she wanted to call in.  I gave her the number. 
[00:52:00]  That's about it, really.  Now you got her.  Go ahead.  Give her some of the old sweet talk.  If you told her to call the show, that means that you thought she had something interesting  for the program.  Right.  There'd be no other reason to call the show.  It's not a personal hook-up date line.  It's obviously not a contest line, either.  Did she show you anything on PowerTalk?  No, not yet.  Not yet. 
[00:52:30]  Heather, are you going to show Big A anything on PowerTalk?  No, I haven't shown anybody on PowerTalk yet.  I'm at Big A, though.  Why don't you show Big A?  Andrew's a good boy.  Are you going to show him anything?  You could go private, just two of yous in one room.  Well, when I get everything all set up properly at the cam, then...  You're not going to show Big A anything.  Thanks for calling.  It's Heather from Canada, everybody.  I want to know if Big A showed her anything.  Yeah.  Have you shown her?  Not yet, no.  Not yet.  What are you waiting for?  Just tilt that camera down into his lap.  What do you got to lose? 
[00:53:00]  Hey, Monday, the PowerTalk cameras, will they be in this studio or what?  I certainly hope so.  We're hoping for Monday that we'll have the PowerTalk cameras finally set up, and hopefully  the ceiling and the walls will be in this new studio.  They haven't disappointed yet over here.  They've come across with everything that they said they were going to.  Very happy.  All right.  Yeah, PowerTalk, boy, that thing has just taken off.  And people like Big A, who pretty much is a social misfit, social outcast in normal life, 
[00:53:30]  right?  That's fair enough to say.  You drive a cab.  It's not even like a yellow cab.  It's just one of these cabs for hire, the kind of where the driver's usually found slumped  over the wheel with a bullet in his head kind of cab.  And you drive it in the Bronx, and you don't really have much of a social life, you know?  So his social life is PowerTalk, where you sit in front of your computer with a camera  on you, watching other people with cameras in front of them, and hopefully you hook up  and girls will show you their parts. 
[00:54:00]  You know, they'll take their clothes off, things like that.  And it's kind of giving people with no social lives a social life.  Right.  So she needs to look.  Big A's talking with people in Canada, girls.  You'd never talk to girls.  You're scared of girls.  Look at you.  You've never talked to girls.  No.  Maybe years ago.  Hey, Anthony, I guess you called Jimmy a social misfit also, because he's on PowerTalk  all the time.  Oh.  Giving it right back to Anthony. 
[00:54:30]  Wow, look at that.  Showed me.  Way to make a point.  Andrew, way to make a point.  By the way, Pat from Wynaki on the feedback, Big A looks like Don Martin from Mad Magazine.  Don Martin.  Yeah.  That's actually a very good visual as well.  All right.  Why don't we get right into the Week in Review with Big A and Twitchels.  Twitchels, how are you doing?  I'm doing good, man.  How about yourself?  Well, what happened after the Almond Joy show?  I've got pretty sick for a while, but I felt a lot better that night.  Yeah.  Twitchels, just in case you don't know, he has Tourette's. 
[00:55:00]  Pretty bad case of it.  Yeah, and we also discovered that if you lie a bag of Almond Joys in front of him, he  has to eat the entire bag.  And the video is up on our website of him puking up the Almond Joys after he ate.  I forgot how many he had.  Fifty-two or something?  Fifty-something?  Like a little bite size?  It was awful.  Well over 50, yeah.  And his whole demeanor changed.  You look like a psycho.  You were giving us stairs that were like...  Private pile. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, private pile stairs.  That's exactly what was going on.  A portable phone brings up a great memory.  I seem to have forgotten about this.  Have you guys completely forgotten about your time at WNEW?  When you wanted to do contests with female listeners, they always let you down.  If you wanted five contestants, you had to book 20.  Stop trying to do contests with girls.  It never works.  That's what I was saying.  Remember that?  Nothing has changed, of course.  It took 20...  We used to have to book 20 girls to get five down. 
[00:56:00]  Well...  Because they were petrified.  Well, Big A will be crawling around in the mousetraps.  Right, Big A?  Big A, you need money?  You're coming on our show for free all the time.  Here's a chance to walk away with some cash.  I need money, too.  I travel two and a half hours.  Oh.  You drive a livery cab in the Bronx with nothing in between.  He's actually...  With that big head, he's been shot three times and just never knew it.  Bounces off.  John's on the line from New York.  He's begging for tool tickets.  We told you what you have to do for tool tickets. 
[00:56:30]  You've got to get your lady down here to crawl around in the minefield of mousetraps.  The tool tickets will be somewhere amongst the mousetraps.  Or if you're a guy, how about this?  You have to crawl around on your underwear, but you have to go like...  No.  I was thinking of a way for something really bad to happen with a mousetrap.  Oh, well.  Yeah, that would hurt.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Hopefully some people are...  People are...  I don't want to see that, though.  I just want to take the mousetrap off and look at the imprint.  You guys ready for the Week in Review? 
[00:57:00]  No, never, but...  All right, here we go.  It's Twitchells and Big A with the Week in Review.  Take it away, boys.  Good morning, I'm Big A.  And I'm Lewis Twitchells and Danny.  Our tops...  Are we this week after being...  Tuck in a cellmate for a week. 
[00:57:30]  Jurors handed terrorists...  Tuck in a cellmate for a life sentence in the state of the death penalty earlier this week. 
[00:58:00]  After hearing the verdict...  Now shall we...  How do you live? 
[00:58:30]  Tuck in a cellmate for a life sentence in the state of the United States...  Tuck in a cellmate for a life sentence in the state of the United States...  still...  sticking to his auntie in the United States...  dance 
[00:59:00]  as he was  said from the courtroom.  Now  that's how we  spoke  this  this  I think how he winds up  for the word.  I think  of terrorism 
[00:59:30]  conspiracy  and will now be  a federal  hockey  until his life  stops.  Until his life  stops.  We got to explain.  We got Danny and Nathaniel.  They write the  We Can Review  for these guys.  And if you haven't  figured out yet  Big A has a problem  with ST words.  So they make sure  there's a ton of ST words  in Big A's story.  Let's say hi to  Alexis in New Jersey.  Alexis.  Yes. 
[01:00:00]  Hi.  You can't do this in the  morning when I'm on the  road because you're  going to get me killed.  It says on the phone  what the hell is this?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know what that is  man.  That is a weird  problem you have  with that ST.  That's when you're  a little boy  and the uncle  sneaks in again.  The hand is in your  face and your face  is in the pillow  and all you hear  whispered is  stay still.  Stay still.  Okay, uncle. 
[01:00:30]  Stan.  TJ, New Jersey,  what's up?  Hey, what's going on  guys?  Thank you for  returning with the  most uncomfortable  radio we'll ever hear.  All right, there you  go.  I love it.  All right, so we're  to Twitchels finally.  Twitchels, go ahead.  The Week in Review  with Big A and Twitchels.  Defense Secretary  Donald H.  Rumseld was  repeatedly interrupted  by protesters  during a speech  on Thursday 
[01:01:00]  and one man,  a former CIA analyst,  accused him of lying  about Iraq  pre-war intelligence.  Three protesters  were escorted away  by security  as each interrupted  Rumseld's speech  by jumping  up and shouting.  Jumping?  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  Jump.  He's got an OCD thing  that whenever anybody  yells jump,  he feels compelled  to jump.  It's such a full word.  Jump.  So there's a lot of  jumps in his story. 
[01:01:30]  You better back up,  Twitchels,  to three protesters.  Yeah, what happened?  No problem, sir.  Three protesters  were escorted away  by security  as each interrupted  Rumseld's speech  by jumping up  and shouting  anti-war messages.  Throughout the speech,  a fourth protestor  stood up  in the middle  of the room  with his back  to Rumsfeld  in silent protest.  Officials reported  no arrest.  Big A is 
[01:02:00]  starting  off  this year's  summer  blockbuster  season.  Mission Impossible  3's  arts  in theaters  today.  Arving  Stoddly  Superstar 
[01:02:30]  Tom Cruise  Stoddly  Mission Impossible  3's  A's  with the formula  of  ticking  crews  in  many  ticking  situations.  Oh my god. 
[01:03:00]  I didn't hear that, bro.  I didn't hear you.  It was unclear.  Yeah, just start  with that word  you can't pronounce.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Come on, you can do it, baby.  Say it. 
[01:03:30]  Say it.  So,  it's expected  that  there will be  standing room only  at most  theaters  and it's  hands  to reason  that  Mission Impossible  3  for  kicks  but  this 
[01:04:00]  year's  arguing  box office  statistics.  Jesus, this is  exhausting to watch,  isn't it?  Wow.  You're crazy  I feel.  Well put.  THQ has  announced that  it's developing  a video game  based on the  television series  The Sopranos. 
[01:04:30]  THQ has said  that the new  Xbox  360  and PlayStation  2 game  will feature  the voices  of various  cast members  including  James Gandolfini  as my boss  Tony  As my boss  Tony  Tony  Soprano.  In the game  you will play  illegitimate son  of big pussy  given an opportunity  to demonstrate  your loyalty  to Tony Soprano.  The game will  center around you  earning money  on collections  protecting your turf

[01:11:30]  his job  Yeah  This is a  great story  Did a girl  just come in?  Oh sorry  I was looking  at Travis  answering the  phones over there  and I thought  a girl would  come in  for the contest  Fiona Apple  had wafted in  Fiona Apple  with a beard  That svelte  body  And get  Bobby  Bobby has  an idea  for the  tool tickets  Don't even  spoil it  Let him  explain it  live on the  program  Bobby's the  guy that  came up  with  No Homo  Yes  He's got 
[01:12:00]  something brand  new  he wants  to do  Which we  didn't explain  earlier  as we were  trying to  explain it  We never  really got  to the  explanation  of  No Homo  Huh?  Bobby's getting  his food  All right  When Bobby  comes back  we'll talk  to him  and what  he wants  to do  for the  tool tickets  Yeah  Okay  Really fast  The Brooklyn  postal worker  delivered an  excuse straight  out of a  Seinfeld episode  when investigators  asked why  he hid  and burned  more than  three years  worth of  letters  There was  just too  much mail  was his 
[01:12:30]  excuse  Too much  mail  Too much  mail  That's what  East Flatbush  letter  loafer  Gregory  Muborn  told postal  officials  after he  was plucked  off his  root  Wednesday  morning  and rested  The bus  came after  firefighters  found thousands  of unopened  letters  more than  20 sacks  of undelivered  mail  in his  basement  The firefighters  had responded  to a report  of smoke  coming from  this guy's  boarded up  apartment  There in  the furnace  they also  found mail  that had  been burned  and a can  of lighter  fluid  Muborn 
[01:13:00]  47 was  charged with  delay and  destruction of  mail which  are federal  offenses  He was  arraigned in  Brooklyn  federal court  and released  on $25,000  bond  Do you know  how many  people got  tickets and  didn't know  it and then  got towed  Yeah  How many  people had  checks they  didn't get  because of  this scumbag  Grandma sends  you a birthday  check  you don't even  get it  Yeah or cash  Ooh  Well how about  Publishers Clearinghouse  You never  You never know  You two could  be a winner  And now  nothing  Did he go  through it  Did they say  if he opened  any and 
[01:13:30]  maybe it was  pilfering  He just didn't  feel like  delivering the  mail  There was  just too  much mail  and he  decided this  was a great  way to get  rid of a lot  of the mail  His father  Does his picture  look like he's  lazy or shiftless  I don't know  I'm just saying  because I've  looked at some  people's pictures  and said  that guy  just looks  lazy  Yeah  Looks a little  lazy  Okay  I'm just  wondering  But the  letter  Larcenous  dad called  the matter  a misunderstanding  Just a  misunderstanding  The bizarre 
[01:14:00]  incident mirrors  the actions  of the wacky  Newman character  played by  Wayne Knight  on the  Seinfeld  Seinfeld  sitcom  whom Jerry  always greets  with a lyric  They have to  explain this  A lyric  Hello Newman  In one episode  the portly  postal slacker  explains to Jerry  why he's sitting  in his apartment  in a robe  surrounded by  sacks of  mail in the  middle of the  day  and you know  he basically  said he didn't  feel like  delivering the  whole episode  Yeah exactly  Yeah because we  don't see  Seinfeld on TV  all day long  It's on what  15 times a day  now  I'll watch it 
[01:14:30]  every time  And knowing  the post office  man this guy  is going to  get a reprimand  Yes  He will get a  slap on the  hand and then  back on the  truck  You may hear  the mousetraps  are being set  in the background  Yeah some of  them go off  For Big A and  Twitchels I guess  we gotta pay him  for their time  on the program  This will be a  great way to  pay him  Mousetraps are  very hard to  set  Hey Bobby  What's up  Here he is  Yeah he came up  with no gay  No homo  Sorry I keep 
[01:15:00]  forgetting the name  No homo  No homo  If you do  something or  say something  I don't know  with your friends  when you're  hanging out and  it comes off as  a little gay  as long as you  say no homo  then it's cool  This might be  a gentle touch  of the arm  and a kiss  on the shoulder  if he's talking  to some girl  you come over  at the bar  and do that  to try to  create some  awkward moment  It might also  entail  taking your  hand  and  kind of 
[01:15:30]  putting it  under  the guy's  undercarriage  pretty much  as he's just  standing there  and then pulling  his hand out  and going  what did you  make in your  pants  kind of a  thing  and  then he  goes  no homo  and that's  supposed to  clear him  of anything  that might  seem a little  gay  in his  actions  Kissing men's  shoulders  and necks  Yeah  Yeah  Which he has  done  to a lot  of the guys  behind the  scenes  A lot  of his  friends 
[01:16:00]  and the  guys  on the  show  interns  and workers  that in turn  have told him  that they're  not comfortable  with this  Patting helmets  as he walks  by just giving  the helmet  a pat  and then  continuing  on  Right  He's done  that too  He has  taken his  hand  and actually  touched  other gentlemen  in that place  where gentlemen  do not want  to be touched  except maybe  by a lady  That's right  And they're  not comfortable  with that  And I think  Than threatened  to punch you  Yes 
[01:16:30]  Than threatened  to hit you  That's how good  Than's body is  He risked a beating  just to get a feel  And now  Well  We have this money  We have the tool  tickets  We have the  mousetraps  We have everything  But the  God damn  whores  that said  they were  going to show up  And of course  we forgot  It's been four years  You gotta book  20 girls  to get  one girl  down here  Yeah  As we move forward

[01:22:00]  a little underage  people getting served  at New York City  bars  A shame on you  segment  Shame shame shame  shame on you  Yeah we hate these  shame on you guys  With their cameras  barging into  people's good times  Yeah  Just annoying  everybody  We're all walking  into restaurants  because there was  a roach on the floor  Who cares  We're in the salad  Tonight Arnold Diaz  put some local bars  to the test  and some of them  ended up in the  Hall of Shame  watch 
[01:22:30]  He's threatening  to call the police  on us  It's the place  where he works  that seems to be  breaking the law  openly serving alcohol  to underage drinkers  no questions asked  In a minute  we'll show you  the undercover evidence  that had the night  manager in a rage  Shut the f***  out of here  I hate Arnold Diaz 
[01:23:00]  Me too  He's got that  dumb mustache  and he's just  wrecking everyone's  good times  Everyone's just  trying to have  a little fun  under the table  Why hasn't someone  just hauled off  and punched  this guy in the face  They might  He's annoying people  Telling them  shame  Shame shame  Shame on you  At Big Nick's  a popular hangout  on Manhattan's  Upper West Side  Happy Hour  lasts for five hours  and a dollar  buys you a 12 ounce beer 
[01:23:30]  We sent three testers  into Big Nick's  Nice promo for the place  All of them  are under 21  One's only 18  The two young looking  guys drinking beer  at the next table  told our testers  they'd have no problem  getting served  Nobody IDs you right  If he can come in here  and not get started  I think you guys are alright  Not yet with 12  He looks like he's dead  One guy admitted  he was under age  I'm 19  19?  The other said  he had a fake ID  but didn't have to  show it at Big Nick's  Their favorite place 
[01:24:00]  to drink they said  Got a draft  and that's a good way  to get freaked  And sure enough  when the waiter  came to take  our tester's order  he never asked  how old they were  or if they had IDs  We got a picture  of course  Miller  Yeah  No it's fine  I don't have course  No it's cool  That's fine  That's your beer eh  Yeah it's cool  Holy crap  This is what the media  this is what you  waste your time doing  Yeah  Some college students 
[01:24:30]  out having a few beers  and you scumbags  have nothing better to do  but bother the establishment  And on top of that  they're setting up the bars  It's not even like  they're going in the bar  and trying to find  underage drinkers  Find underage drinkers  They're actually  getting the underage drinkers  sending them in  and just messing up  this guy's whole business  Why?  You know  why don't you just  go into a regular bar  and try to find  the underage drinkers  Yeah  Why set up the guy?  I hope Arnold Diaz  is found in a rest area  with a map of Hawaii  and his mustache  A couple of minutes later 
[01:25:00]  the beer arrived  and our testers  as instructed  paid to check  and left  without drinking anything  Aw good  That's why I went in  to speak with  the night manager  Are you supposed  to ask kids for ID?  Yes we do that  Do you?  Okay  We don't have kids  right now  You don't  We never serve kids  You don't serve kids  So you ask for identification?  Of course  You do  Yeah but I'm busy now  I'm getting out of here  Okay because we sent kids in  and they weren't asked for ID  Sir 
[01:25:30]  Get the f*** out of here  I like this guy  He's got spunk  Shut up  Get the f*** out of here  Some cranky Greek  Just trying to make  make his paycheck  A couple of bucks  He's just trying to make  a few dollars  You're right  Right  In this old gag  They do it with the cigarettes  Yeah  They send in the underage kids  to buy the cigarettes  Mm-hmm  Now Arnold Diaz  is at a second bar  We left  and then sent our testers  into Maliki's  a bar restaurant  just a block away  Once again 
[01:26:00]  there were no questions  about age or ID  All the waitress wanted to know  was bottle or draft  Poor chick just trying to make a few tips  Of course  Just trying to eke out a living  There's probably some real things  he could get done  with his shame on you segment  It's against the law  of course  and there are agencies  you know  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms 
[01:26:30]  I don't know  What bureau is in charge  of the thing  The SLA  Yeah, they're out there  all the time  making sure that these places  are not serving  underage people  State liquor authority  Yeah, they're supposed to go around  They're raiding bars and clubs  all the time  They don't need  Arnold Diaz's help  It's been going on for years  with his stupid testers  What a creep  ABC  Alcohol  Beverage Control  There you go  Commission  After the beers were served  our testers left  without drinking anything  and a few days later  I returned 
[01:27:00]  to speak with the owner  of Maliki's  You know  he has to make sure  that the underage  testers didn't drink anything  They didn't drink anything  Gotta make sure you say that  right, Arnold?  The owner of Maliki's  We sent three young people  in here  underage  no ID  they were served  without any questions  Well, that's  we'll have to instruct  our staff  not to do that any longer  It's certainly a problem  I feel very upset  that this would happen  Arnold's gonna get fired now  Sometimes we do have police 
[01:27:30]  that come here undercover  and things like that  Maliki's has been caught  twice in the past five years  serving liquor to minors  It's not bad  Fines of $1,500  for the first offense  $2,500 for the second  But fines like that  are not enough  of a deterrent  says Dina Cohen  President of  Mothers Against Drunk Driving's  Metro Chapter  They have to lose  their liquor license  Even if they lose it  for six months  that would be  a significant  hit on them  That's a bit of a  harsh penalty 
[01:28:00]  for  you know  you're  the responsibility  lies with the  waitress  and you know  the waiter staff  how is some guy  just hiring  some workers  that are supposed  to do this  now he's gotta suffer  for six months  of no income  because somebody  gets a drink  underage  I understand  she's got her agenda  and she's very upset  but you know something  perhaps  Mothers Against Drunk Driving 
[01:28:30]  shouldn't be at the  forefront of that issue  they're a little  too emotionally connected  you can understand why  but I mean come on  I don't know  come on  I agree six months  is too much though  maybe  for eight hours  eight hours  they close the place down  hey uh  Pat from Menaki  is on fire today  literally I hope  he's  on the instant feedback  someone should follow  Arnold Diaz around  and find out where  he's quote  cutting corners  in life  cutting corners 
[01:29:00]  very good  if anybody knows  anything about  Arnold Diaz  can you please  let us know  let us know  just follow him around  24 hours a day  to see what he's doing  that would be kind of fun  he leaves you know  the studio  and you're just  following him with a camera  right into a buddy booth  he doesn't even  try to cover it up  was Arnold  eating a donut  in here  that would be  so funny  just follow him around  until he's  completely annoyed  just making sure 
[01:29:30]  you're not cutting  any corners in life  there Arnold  with a video camera  why would that be  harassment if you're  doing a story  I don't think it would  be  and Bill and Waterford  dare I say it  but Arnold Diaz  is a narc  yeah  what a rat  whole family  where's the last track  we don't have it  huh  yeah I don't think  it's here  well looks like  someone's getting  fired  shame  nothing  shame on Ben  oh this might work  so into our Fox 5  hall of shame  we induct  big nicks 
[01:30:00]  and malachies  for making  underage drinking  all too easy  shame  shame  shame  shame  oh they updated  that a little  yeah  well cause he moved  over to another  news station  oh he did  so he couldn't use  the shame  shame  shame  shame  shame  yeah I know  I like that one  so there's the latest  we can't get enough  of the shame  on you segments  oh they have them  all over the country  too  you got your  pain in the ass  reporter that goes  out chasing people  I like the reporters  that dress  that dress as

[01:41:30]  and it's on  that'll be the biggest thing ever  for the faithful listeners  you know  they've been through this with us  every time we  try to use a wireless mic  it's not turned on  for some reason  why would it be turned on  you know  you're only a radio show  yeah you know  you're just a communication  and it's not like  this is college radio  this is the big time  I mean  yeah I didn't want to  you know  maybe for the pay for  the wireless mic  can not work  what are you doing Bill  stop horse playing  I just threw a bottle of water  all Bill's mousetraps  that he just said  you can hear the mousetraps  going off in the background  now he's old man  that'll be the grand finale 
[01:42:00]  as Big A and Twitchells  grabs money today  grab money today  for their appearances  on our show  I dropped it  hey Bobby  where'd you get the  No Homo concept from  a friend of mine  actually  told one day  he was like  oh you want to play  a game of gay chicken  I was like  what's gay chicken  and he explained it to me  we didn't actually play  but you know  we laughed a little bit  and that's what happened  yeah  Bobby  that was a compelling story  right there  he suggested this gay chicken thing  Josh  where he wants to do it 
[01:42:30]  with another guy  supposed to be blindfolded  slowly go in for a kiss  the first person  that turns away  loses  alright  how gay  it's pretty gay  well  here's the problem  the phones exploded  the instant feedback  exploded  our personal phones  exploded  yeah  everyone said that  gay chicken  was great  when they heard it  on Howard Stern  yeah  no  apparently  you are giving us  Howard bits  do you understand that  we're fighting that battle 
[01:43:00]  every day of our careers  for the last 10 years  to try to separate ourselves  from Howard Stern  and do our own thing  and you just casually bring  a Howard Stern bit  to our show  and undermine us  I didn't  I really didn't know  it was a bit of his  just a friend of mine  said it  I thought it was kind of fun  just admit it Bobby  I swear to god  you're in radio  you have a Ron and Fez shirt on  you're helping us out  you know the radio business  not really  I'm a finance major  I just  I got into radio  like  I got into radio  I got into radio 
[01:43:30]  you kind of made us  look stupid today  like a year ago  I'll say this  just due diligence  you know  if you have this great bit  you just gotta make sure  it's got somebody else's  great bit  how about that  I'm just trying to be  I'm trying to split the baby here  people are like  guys don't go there  don't go there  because our listeners  understand the battle  we fight  we're trying to show  people that we are  different than him  I understand  I really didn't do that  on purpose  I apologize  I just thought  it was a friend of mine  that thought it was  kind of funny  I didn't know  where it came from  because understand this  there are now 
[01:44:00]  there are now millions  of people on that  Merritt Parkway  sitting there going  nice  I got some stuff  I don't want to go to the  I don't want to go pay  I don't want to go pay  and now I got something  to listen to in my car  and so somebody's  commuting in from  a Marinette or wherever  and you can't  do the Howard bits  you gotta  you know  let's send those over  to wherever  why don't you just  call me Jimmy  Jimmy  stupid  thanks Bobby  sorry  my foot's in my mouth  I apologize  that's alright  if you missed this  whole thing  you can catch our show  on E tonight 
[01:44:30]  dope  we should make him  like roll around  in the mousetraps  or something man  naked  maybe you can send him  in the bathroom  and he can come out  in a bikini  oh wait a second  that's Howard  naked  you should be  completely naked  rolling around  in the mousetraps  I mean you enjoy  being naked  in front of other guys  and of course  if you say no homo  it's not gay  right Bobby  obviously  look at this 
[01:45:00]  it took me  a matter of seconds  to look up  gay chicken  on the internet  and where does it  turn up  in an interview  with Howard  it's in an interview  it would be so easy  to have looked  that up  to see  but the internet  it's a fad  it really is  just a passing thing  and I can kind of  see it already  going downhill  lots of construction  on the information  superhighway  yes  hey Bobby 
[01:45:30]  what are you doing here  you're supposed to be  prank calling Larry King  by the way  Matt in Virginia  and Stern  ripped it off  from Scrubs  a Scrubs episode  with Brendan Fraser  so  oh yeah  there you go  wow  let's say hi to Nathan  on Long Island  bye Bobby  gentlemen  it is absolutely  an honor  how are you  good let's go  I had a question  whether or not  this was gay  or  it was just funny  when I was working  at the good old 
[01:46:00]  guitar center  back out  in the Rochester  area  we used to play  a game where  new management  would come in  and as we would  greet each other  down the hall  instead of  shaking hands  we would  grab each other's  crotch  and then just make  like nothing happened  and kind of go along  with our day  give me my favorite  little cupcake  thanks  why do you even  need to ask that sir  yeah that is  so gay  not funny  at all  it is gay  we do help out  the listeners  Josh  we play a game  called gay or funny  sometimes 
[01:46:30]  something that might  on the outside  appear gay  is hysterically funny  it usually entails  maybe the end  of a party  a lot of booze  and  friends  goofing on  the passed out  friend  by doing certain  things  that might  appear gay  in maybe other  settings  but in that  setting  it's funny  so the funny  trumps all  right  the funny  kind of  beats out  the gay  in that circumstance  but people  sometimes question  they go  I don't know 
[01:47:00]  guys  is this gay  or funny  they explain  the situation  we let them  know  instantly  whether it  was gay  or funny  like you're  watching  let's help  Josh out  you know  he works  for ESPN  now  you're watching  the Super Bowl  with a bunch  of your buddies  it's pretty much  all guys  right  and a guy  goes to get  I don't know  beer from the fridge  and he walks  back  he's got  the beer  but now  he's just  completely naked  and sits  back down  on the couch  funny  that's funny  right  there's a lot  of gayness  to it  but it would  be funny  that's funny  funny  is the ace 
[01:47:30]  bam  your buddy  passes out  at a party  and everyone  decides to  take out  their you know  what  can you say  it like that  I don't even  know  and then  you get it  close to the  face  they're passed  out  and you start  taking pictures  funny  there you go  see he knows  how to play  ends up on  the internet  ruins his  career  right  hysterical  because he's  a priest  and you're  all seven  so every once  in a while  a listener  will call up  and he'll  ask us  if it's gay  or funny  and we help 
[01:48:00]  him out  yeah  is it  generally  funny  most times  most cases  funny  yeah sometimes  though you go  why are you  calling  that is just  gay  but it's also  all in the  telling  it's all  in the  presentation  you gotta  build  you could  destroy  a perfectly  funny thing  and by  telling  it wrong  you gotta  point  the way  it's told  in one way  it could be  gay  in another way  it could be  funny  yeah  all right  but funny  definitely  take that  into consideration  now  hey we gotta  figure out  what to do  with Bobby  see he really 
[01:48:30]  likes working  with this show  he's not even  officially a part  of this radio  show he helps  out Ron and Fez  right  how did he  get in here  but he really  likes radio  he likes what  we do  so he just  kinda hangs out  and does what  he can for us  but now  I think  he's banned  from the show  until we figure  out something  that he's gotta  do now  oh you know  what you should  do  it's like  it's an internet  thing  like he's gotta  find a bunch  of stuff  on the internet  cause you really  you wanna help  you wanna rehabilitate  you just don't  wanna incarcerate  like help him  no we're into  just punishment  oh we're punished  yeah 
[01:49:00]  we don't care  about rehab  we figure that  through harsh  punishment  comes rehabilitate  because there's  the fear  of punishment  again  alright let it be  said  I tried to help  Bob  Nathaniel  what do you got  I'm not sure  if this is ample  but Bobby did  say he was  willing to take  a mousetrap  to the tongue  yes he did  the tongue  if he can  if he can  let's go right now  rest it on the edge  edge of the console  let's go right now  this is sort of  this is an option  this is punishment  or funny  we gotta take a break  but let's do it 
[01:49:30]  right this second  let's go  and I don't even know  if this is gonna be  good enough  nah it'll be fine  let's go  alright put it  right on the edge  there  get the microphone  near him  now make sure  you stick your tongue  out far  so you don't  hit a lip  or your nose  by the way  you're not holding  anyone responsible  right  no  you're doing this  on your own  I'm doing this  on my own  and uh  you're gonna  I feel bad  I messed up  alright let's go  and through  and through your  speaking  Bobby  you  you  you  you  uh  kind of  put the show  in a bad  position  so your tongue 
[01:50:00]  should be  I like how we're  using this  1400s justice  let's put him in an  iron maiden  let's go  and if it doesn't  stick to your tongue  you gotta do it again  you gotta stick it out  don't let the thing  hit your nose  should someone hold  the back of the  mousetrap to make  sure it's gonna stick  put the fat part of  your tongue in there  you don't wanna do  the tips  and tip your head  back so it doesn't  hit your nose  oh I hope it hits  that nose of yours  no cause that won't  hurt enough  this is Bobby's  punishment  no see  see nothing  it didn't work  nothing  well looks like  another appendage  might have to be  stuck in the  mousetrap  stand up 
[01:50:30]  stand up  club soda  Kenny  reset  alright get the mic  Kenny will get  the job done  oh god  alright  he is hurting  wow is he hurting  alright he's leaving  the studio  oh that had a hurt  we get a picture of  that  who cares  hey Bobby  Bobby  you alright  what  let me see your  tongue stick it out  it's not like  there's a line in it 
[01:51:00]  let me see your tongue  did you get a picture  of it when he did it  oh I'm shaking  yeah that had a hurt  it's not like there's  a lot of nerve endings  on your tongue  wow  now will you be  compelled to  maybe give us  bad information again  I don't think you  would want to do that  now knowing that  the mousetrap is ready  no I will not  for the tongue  did he rehabilitate  Bobby certainly did  he turned himself in  he goes look  I've been riding around  a schoolyard  I think I need help  and we helped him  good for you  this is like  a really odd version 
[01:51:30]  of the after school special  this was like the moral  so now  Bobby have you learned  have you learned your lesson  he learned  alright we gotta take  a quick break  Bobby get out of here  when we get back  Big A and Twitchels  will be crawling around  in the minefield  of mousetraps  earning their keep today  no broads  it was supposed to be  hot broads  we'll explain it to Josh  after the break  it's the Opie and Anthony  program  our duties  do do do do  fall  our duties  do do do do  fall  our duties  do do do do  have destructive power  you think it stinks now  you should have seen it  a month ago  Opie and Anthony 
[01:52:00]  weekday mornings  I gotta tell you  we've had a rough start  as far as  taking the show  over here  yeah  to terrestrial radio  we started with Anthony  really really sick  yeah I had a great cold  that I couldn't even talk  and then I got sick  I've been sick all week  and now little Jimmy Norton  he had to take a day off  for food poisoning  and today he's in the bathroom  again  it has to be at least  five or six times 
[01:52:30]  yeah it's at least  twice a break  and oh  someone said  the bathroom reeks  every time he comes out of there  but someone says  that the room  that Twitchels  and Big A were in  when they took their  shoes and socks off  I guess now reeks  is that what I'm hearing  smells like feet  let me take a call  real fast from Philly  Adam listening to us  on WYSP  Adam what's up  hey what's going on guys 
[01:53:00]  hey  hey  we got you  go  hello  we got you  okay  Twitchels just banged  his head into the microphone  because he's blindfolded  that'll cure your Tourette  Adam go ahead  yeah how do you become  an ONA pest  how do you become  an ONA pest  that's a very very good question  yeah  we have  you know  some shows have armies  we have ONA pests  and it makes the  the armies out there  look ridiculous  yeah  know what we should do  on Monday  we should have 
[01:53:30]  maybe Doug Out Doug  or one of the other  Uber ONA pests  call in the program  and explain how you  become a pest  and what you should do  for the radio show  how does that sound  there's a whole thing  where you gotta find  websites that are  kinda hidden  and there's a loyalty thing  I don't even know  I don't even know  but these guys  when they become pests  and join the  the whole bunch of pests  they get things done  we were  we were removed  from DirecTV  at one point  because DirecTV 
[01:54:00]  decided to  go with only music  instead of talk programming  on those channels  you know  you switch around  your cable channels  or satellite channels  and you see  country music  rock music  and you have it  on his background music  on your TV  well we were part of that  but they decided  to go all music  and we were eliminated  along with the  Major League Baseball channel  they had anything  talk  well the pests  were so upset  that they would not  leave DirecTV alone  they pounded  the president  of DirecTV  until  within a week  the guy said  okay  we're putting 
[01:54:30]  Opie and Anthony  back on  yeah they're very  very aggressive  they get things done  they fight battles  all the time  that we never even hear about  it's not just about  like the  radio station's army  where they you know  put a bumper sticker  on their car  and that's it  these guys are like  a militia  it's like having your own  church of Scientology  right  like you know  don't wait into battle  with us  because we will ruin you  right  and they know  they know all the tricks  they're so seasoned  they're battle seasoned  that they know  how to get results 
[01:55:00]  they know all the tricks  they trade information  with each other  like if one guy  has a phone number  one guy calls up  it's not going to do much  that one guy  then gets on the network  of communications  the pest has  gives out all  of the information  and now this guy's got  thousands of people  just pounding him  he's going to notice  buy a man a fish  feed one man  teach a man to fish  or in this case  bombard  DirecTV's president  teach a man  to bombard  there you go  they're just really obnoxious 
[01:55:30]  they get things done  they're very very aggressive  very very active  Jim you alright man  Ben is harassing  a blindfolded Twitchell  by smacking him  with a napkin  and then Twitchell  just blindly  throws fists out  and Ben laughs at him  yeah  so Adam  we'll explain  the whole  the whole O&A pest thing  on Monday  we'll have one of the  the pest call up  and tell you how you  can join  alright  alright  let's go to June  in Philly  a lot of calls  from Philly today  June what's up

[01:58:00]  that I am now  implementing  because I can  make up rules  as I go along  that's right  if any of us  determine  that they are  avoiding traps  by sliding  their hands  on the floor  we noticed  Patty doing  this yesterday  right  if you don't  lift your hand  up and put it  down  you're not  going to put  it in a  mousetrap  if you just  slide them  you're pushing  the mousetraps  out of the way  if we see you  doing that  we will  take away  the last bill  that you  just put  in your pocket  we take  all of it 
[01:58:30]  away  all of it  we take  all of it  away  we throw  it out  the window  and we throw  it out  the window  and then we  pull your  trousers down  so if  they slide  the trap  and we see  that they're  trying to  evade it  by sliding  it  they lose  whatever money  they have  on them  alright  get these  guys  on all  fours  you don't  understand  that rule  people  guys  big A  retards  big A  talk  big A  yes I  understand  big A  Mike's friend  is funny  big A  it's on your

[02:13:00]  to be up  hot broads  and what happened  we ended up with  Twitchells and Big A  and that's it  you know what did show up  a lot of warm diarrhea  that made quite an appearance  Jimmy was shitting his brains out  the entire first half of the show  and I have to shit again  of course you do  already  well let's get an update from Ben  we were supposed to have a mariachi band  do the walk with us today  Ben what happened  told us to go fuck ourselves  they got 1500 bucks to go to Long Island  and they just called us and told us  so  oh so  they got a better deal  and just  renege 
[02:13:30]  get off their number  and we'll get back to that place  oh yeah  these Mexicans are going down  what was the name  of their mariachi band  La Lazio  La Lazio  by the way  Big A and Twitchells  we ended up giving them  the entire 500 dollars  oh how stupid  that's their number  okay  that's the number  I don't know if we can give it  we'll give it out  you know we had  they could  it would have been a 5 minute thing  for them to do for us  could have thrown them some bucks  they weren't the most reliable guys anyway 
[02:14:00]  because this  because they're Mexican  is that what you're saying  yeah  exactly  totally  100%  alright also out here  to do the walk with us  of course  it's Twitchells  yo what's up man  and the fans that have joined us out here  and some of the O&A pests  they're already yelling  jump to Twitchells  so that's going to make it  make it a lot of fun  as we walk over to XM  and of course Big A  who brought his luggage  for some reason  what's that about  it's like lunch  this is Massive Pose  I'm taking Massive Pose  with luggage over to XM 
[02:14:30]  why  because he asked me to  is that the smallest briefcase  you can fit an entire  dismembered hooker in  yeah  that's Henry Lee Lucas' luggage  I guess  alright also  that was fun  also for the walk  Josh Elliott  who did a great job with us today  from ESPN  Josh  it's good to see you guys  look at  so this is the second half  of your world domination  this is nice  now we're up there  with the stars and the planets  number two  where we can curse  I can say I knew you guys would  yeah  you know

[02:32:00]  let's hear one  well I have to  I can't time it out  like that  how about this  whenever I think  it's not going to happen  just be prepared  because that's what  will happen  all right  do you think another one  will come in this session  my stomach right now  I feel like there's  boulders rolling around  in it  yeah  yeah it's of course  so at any time  we'll just blurt  something out beforehand  so we can shut up  okay of course  we wouldn't want to miss that  no we wouldn't want to miss that  because that first one  was perfect  well no you know  what I was thinking  I mean the point is this  oh is he having a tough time 
[02:32:30]  it sounds like a baseball player  spitting on the sideline  before he uh  he is having a rough time in there man  he's got nothing left  he's got nothing left  he's battling  that's just that's the  an organ is coming out next  oh is that disgusting  this is the difference between  satellite radio  and terrestrial radio 
[02:33:00]  on terrestrial radio  we were kind of skirting the issue  saying Jimmy's in the bathroom a lot  he's having a problem  you know  yeah  and then next time  we uh  we give you the sounds  of Jimmy pooping  here it is  Jimmy  taking a dump  boy that really sounded uh  painful too  like there's gonna be some burning  and I get in here a second late  and I'm looking around  I'm like yeah I hear Jimmy  where are you Jimmy  where oh  there's a little bit of liquid too  yeah  is it burning Jimmy 
[02:33:30]  you have no idea  really bad  let me see if there's a little liquid  hold on  let's let's let's  let's say a prayer  just a little bit  oh you're like a skunk  it was like a baby foot in mud  oh you're horrible  and our smoothies are here Jimmy  that should help  yeah  help the process  this is good  thank you  you're welcome  Kenny is so  my straw doesn't work  take the thing off the top 
[02:34:00]  yeah the paper's gotta come off  hey you want me to make you a smoothie  alright  why is that so funny  why is it funny  it starts being funny  when you're like seven years old  and never  it just doesn't stop  dude the anal state  the anal state  it's never not funny  anything involved  oh  you missed straw  my straw's broken  that's why it's not working  alright we're settling in  for the second half  what a delicious smoothie 
[02:34:30]  Jimmy how's yours  um really really good  you coming back in here  anytime soon  if I can stand up  that um  that's one of those  that even when you're done  you're gonna have to sit there  a while huh  dude every time I stand up  my stomach goes  and I go  oh time to sit again  isn't it  did you ever have to um  lift the back  of the toilet bowl  just so you could  dip the paper  in the water  in the tank  to cool down 
[02:35:00]  the fire  no  I've had to do that  wait what  you don't want to dip  toilet paper  in the water  that you've crapped in  right  so if you have one  that's just burning  the hell out of your ass  you need water  you can't get up  and go to a faucet  in a public bathroom  so you lift the tank  behind you  if there's a tank in there  you dip the  toilet paper in there  a little bit  to get a little wet  and then you dab it around  and then you dab a little 
[02:35:30]  dab dab  just to cool down the fire  before you go in  for the wipe  because if you just wipe  when it's flaming like that  you're going to do  some abrasive  abrasive  and acid  yeah  just enough to dilute  the acid  that's a little handy tip  from your pal Anthony  the water back in the tank  is clean my friends  again another  another moral of the story  this is fantastic  we're just here to help  you guys are helpers  we're just here to help  you're helpers  Jimmy anything else  oh I'm sure there will be  I'll just interrupt 
[02:36:00]  you guys do what you gotta do  when I  alright  when I have something to say  I'll just go  Jimmy  and the amazing  talking asshole  oh my god  this is not even my microphone  that I'm using  I didn't even  they handed me one  that said opium  where are you holding it  to get the best sound  well it's not by my face  wonderful  when Jimmy feels up to it  what we got for the  second half of the 
[02:36:30]  opium anthony program today  Jimmy's first call  into the show  we finally found it  are we sure this is it  ah yes  one of the listeners  found it  one of the listeners  found it  and sent it in  so we got like  eight tracks  Jimmy's first appearance  on the opium anthony program  we've had some  false alarms with this  people have said  it was the first call  or appearance  and we're talking  like old friends  so hopefully  this really is  the first one  by the way  David has a very good question  David 
[02:37:00]  yeah  hey  how's it going  what's up  good man  hey man  how the hell  are you guys  even able to eat  those smoothies  I'm driving down  the highway  and as soon as  I hear Jimmy  I lose my coffee  I throw up in my mouth  I'm sitting here  on the side  trying to clean myself  up now because  of you assholes  hard to eat with a boner  good point sir  we are so desensitized  we're like  the second tour people  I had just  I had just turned it on  and I didn't know  what the hell was happening 
[02:37:30]  the first one was the best  I just get on about  8.15 here in San Antonio  and that's the first thing  I hear  oh  yeah  it's horrible  yeah we're desensitized  we're like  war torn veterans  well sir you know what  I mean I'm trying to get better  and all of a sudden  and right back at you Jimmy  yep let me have a little  well that's a good smoothie  it really is a good smoothie  you know I gotta tell you  I'm looking forward to seeing 
[02:38:00]  Norton when I come in today  yeah  you know I'm looking forward  to hanging out  seeing him be sitting  you know do his thing  watch him do it  uh huh  Jim  hi  where have you gone Jim  um I'm pretty much  where I should be  contributing where I should be  on a toilet  contributing shit noises  at 37 years of age  good acoustics though  who knew about the acoustics  of the toilet  that really does have a great echo  Jimmy are you getting up  anytime soon  I don't know  I'm kind of  we're gonna have to run  an ISDN line  into the fucking bathroom  that could be funny 
[02:38:30]  to just have you do  the rest of the show  from there  if you need to  Jimmy please do a  psst  there's no one in here  no I know  if someone shows up  right  I feel like I have to puke too  I think I got a stomach virus  someone's saying that  it sounds like intestinal virus  yeah  well  hey Anthony  we got the dump sheet  from the first half  of the program  oh let's see  is it printed out yet  yeah just use  right over there  how many  we did pretty well today  three  three  let me see  the first one

[02:39:30]  show studios  the daily dump report  the daily dump  for the day  that was a real one  wow that was a real dump  Jimmy that was a real one right  they're all real  perfect timing  on cue  that  that's unbelievable  the dump report  and he just dumped  Jimmy you are heading  toward dry heaves  um  I don't  it happened to me  once in my life 
[02:40:00]  and you wanted to die  if I was gonna dry heaves  I didn't throw up yesterday  or up  shit  my hold on  my  I just  I'm trying to stand up  I'm stepping on my earphones  and the tape  popped out of my ear  oh did it hit the floor  or the toilet  now Jimmy I'm talking about  dry heaving from your butt  oh okay  that happened to me  once in my life  it sounds like you're  heading toward that  well that's fine  I had a lot of gas yesterday  and it just seems like  everything I put in my body  my body goes  no thanks  and spits it out  in a liquid form  well please come in  and slam your smoothie

[02:41:00]  that should not have  gotten dumped  it said Norton talking  about a group of guys  taking it out  and putting it next to  a guy that's passed out  his face  and taking pictures  dumped because of the  reference to seven year olds  that shouldn't have been dumped  yeah well  you know how sensitive  they are to  pedophilia  over  with the FCC  at 8.41  the third and last dump  was when Twitchells  was in the mousetraps 
[02:41:30]  he got snapped by one  and of course  blurted out the word  fuck  uh oh  sounds like it's  building up  percolating  we've had a really  disgusting week  of radio  if you think about it  a really disgusting week  like here  yeah  here  at XM  Jim is there satisfaction  like what is it right now  awful  what are you feeling right now

[03:22:00]  poop  here's me  running to  the out  house  to take  a big  old  hurry  and as  we leave  you on  this  Sunday  morning  the  sounds  of  pooping  because  there's  nothing  better  than a  good  poop  here 
[03:22:30]  here at  the  opian  anthony  show  we  encourage  our  staff  to be  open  and  honest  with  one  another  but  sometimes  the lines  of  communication  get  crossed  and in  order to  alleviate  confusion  simple rules  need to be  put in place  to protect  our employees  introducing  the no  homo  rule  put  simply  the  no  homo  rule  states  that  any  overtly  homosexual  comment  is rendered  meaningless  when a  simple  no  homo  is invoked  for example  you know  what  nathaniel  i  wouldn't  mind  tasting  your  semen  no  homo  even 
[03:23:00]  the  most  disturbing  comments  from a  closeted  intern  become  trivial  when  applying  the  no  homo  rule  oh  eric  i  want  to  stare  into  your  eyes  lovingly  while  i  masturbate  you  no  homo  ultimately  the  entire  staff  feels  more  comfortable  knowing  that  this  behavior  is  all  in  good  fun  say  guys  i  would  love  to  bury  my  cock  balls  deep  in  your  anuses  and  oh  sorry  please  is this  even a  bit  anymore 
[03:23:30]  travis  i'll  let  you  decide  peace  i never  knew  but  i  believe  that  you  trust  in  me  oh  speak  to  me  speak  the  truth  oh  make  your  peace  I never knew, but I believe that you're trusting me. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, well, speak to me.  Off Godsmack 4, speak.  Congratulations to Godsmack.  Biggest selling CD of the week.  Good.  First week out, it did 214,000 copies, I believe.  No one was even close to that. 
[03:24:30]  Number one record.  Godsmack's still doing it.  We're hoping to get them on the show in the near future.  Yeah, maybe they'll hang up on them when we call.  What happened?  So can I ask?  I got to ask.  I'm on my way over in the cab.  I'm going through my post.  Yeah.  I see K-Rock.  I see Stearns.  You start seeing the buzz and names.  I'm like, oh, good.  My boys.  Let's read the item.  Right.  I don't see your names anywhere.  No.  Well, Jimmy's really pissed off about this.  Yeah, I just, I hate these. 
[03:25:00]  We can't even get mad anymore because we already know what the deal is.  I just hate these biased scumbags.  The article is this.  It's in the New York Post.  Page six article.  Richard Johnson.  Page six.  And it says, the thing is, Stern subs bleeping awful.  CBS radio didn't accomplish much by getting rid of Howard Stern except losing a lot of its audience.  Since Stern replacement on Free FM, David Lee Rothbaum was yanked.  JB and Elvis of San Francisco have been aired in the 9 to 10 a.m. hour yesterday.  And they start going over stuff that was dumped and Tom Chiasano's reaction, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:25:30]  They don't mention the Opie and Anthony show at all.  And it's a purposeful snub.  And I just, I can't stand this fucking cocksucker for page six for the post.  It's Richard Johnson.  And who's the other guy that's under investigation now for these fucks?  Jared Ball Stern.  Yeah.  Page six.  A lot of credibility these days.  Yeah, what did he say?  You gave me a hundred, allegedly said, I'll give you a hundred thousand and I can curry favor with Richard Johnson.  Not only that, though, they caught Ron Perlman, gave him money. 
[03:26:00]  They got a couple guys that actually, Perlman gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars.  So what happened now?  Of course, we would like to call up Mr. Johnson.  Richard Johnson and get him on the air to maybe talk about his obvious Howard Stern bias that he's had over the years.  Which, hey, look, if you're a Stern guy because you're loyal and, look, even the media, they're human beings.  Fine.  Nobody cares if that's where your slant is and that's who you are because that's, you know, whatever.  But when you're supposed to be involved in the media and you do such a purposeful editing job. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing.  It's like all of a sudden the replacement starts at nine.  Yeah, we understand that.  How about six to nine where there's this other show?  JV and Elvis are on from nine to ten or actually nine, you know, until the end of their show.  But replacing from nine to ten the morning show.  Who's doing six to nine?  He's a fucking biased henhouse woman, you fucking chick.  A gossip columnist chick.  Fucking broad you are.  Bip, bip, bip.  Did you hear what so-and-so said?  Bip, bip, bip, bip.  I saw Leo DiCaprio. 
[03:27:00]  Bip, bip, bip, bip.  Who was on the beach with so-and-so?  You fucking henhouse woman cunt.  You fucking henhouse woman cunt.  We try to get Richard Johnson on this fine program.  Be hung up on our own Ben Sparks.  Yeah, Ben called him, right?  Yeah, he hung up.  He hung up after I talked to him for a couple seconds.  He said, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't want to talk.  I don't want to go to the air.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm too busy.  He first told me he's too busy.  Too busy.  Stop it.  Yeah.  And then he wanted me to talk to someone in PR there. 
[03:27:30]  What does Puerto Rico have to do with this, Ben?  Richard.Johnson at NewYorkPost.com.  Richard.Johnson at NewYorkPost.com.  It's in the paper.  Oh, yeah, I know.  So I would only encourage, maybe we have listeners out there that know this guy or that are friends  with this guy and have an in with him and can communicate with him.  So maybe you'd want to email him.  Get an answer.  And get an answer, an honest answer.  Did you hear about so-and-so? 
[03:28:00]  She was dating so-and-so.  Did you see the dress on her?  I couldn't believe she wore that.  You fucking woman.  Richard.Johnson at NewYorkPost.com.  NYPost.  Oh, you're right.  Good point.  Richard.Johnson at NYPost.com.  NYPost.com.  NYPost.  Because is it really a story about Stern replacements?  Well, it's about Jay-Z.  And by the way, the last sentence.  But to Thompson, Stern's imitators are just as bad.  Quote, CBS Radio thinks the coast is clear because Stern is gone, but it's not. 
[03:28:30]  You know something interesting about the whole Page Six thing?  We have an old friend that used to work there, Ian, and he's writing a novel about gossip columnists  who take money and gifts for preferential treatment course, which is coming up.  And he used to work there, so.  I don't know if this guy's ever done that.  Ask him why he licks Howard's ass, too.  Yeah, why?  Again, if you're a Howard guy, that's your thing.  That's fine.  But when it comes down to affecting the way you report the news like this, I know it's 
[03:29:00]  only a gossip thing.  I know this is something that fucking old broads read.  You know, did you hear what someone's...  I couldn't believe he was dating.  I thought Salma Hayek was coming.  Bip, bip, bip, bip.  Fucking old bitty.  And then they're not even brave to print names, so it's always, which leading actor likes  to suck cock?  And again, just another...  Do you have to guess who it is?  Another fucker.  It's like, why won't you come on the air and discuss it?  We would have given you a fair shot.  We would have given you a fair shot.  We would have given you a fair shot.  We would have given you a fair shot.  Healy wound up liking him. 
[03:29:30]  Can't be fucking...  Richard.Johnson at nypost.com.  I'm just hoping we have enough listeners out there that are computer savvy, that know  this guy, that may have an in with him, and that can find out some answers.  There you go.  Serious inquiries only, people.  Serious inquiries only, people.  Which leading man in Hollywood has a mission to suck as much cock as possible?  And it's impossible for him to actually have married that girl and gotten her pregnant. 
[03:30:00]  Here's a...  Al Roker.  Yeah.  What's in the column today, Jimmy?  Help us out.  Yeah, give us a little Al Roker news.  Al Roker sure knows how to land an interview.  Witnesses say...  Who are the witnesses?  Who?  Witnesses say ABC's radio, David Blaustein, who the fuck that is, was in the middle of one  with Ken Burns at Mission Impossible 3.  When Roker physically grabbed Burns in mid-sentence and yanked him away for his own piece.  No.  My God.  Wow.  Real battle going on here. 
[03:30:30]  Witnesses say...  You fucking henhouse woman.  You know, this fucking...  When you write this, you should be forced to be fucking hanging laundry in the suburbs  talking to another fat housewife in a house dress.  That's how you...  With rollers in your hair.  Fucking gossip columnist.  We hear...  And this is real today.  We hear that David Blaine will try to break the 8-minute, 58-second record for holding  his breath on Monday by breathing pure oxygen first. 
[03:31:00]  Ah!  I can sleep tonight now, knowing that.  That's big.  That's huge.  Good.  Now I know.  That was bothering me.  Sightings.  Ronald Perlman lunching with Money Honey, Maria Bartiromo.  Bartiromo.  At the Four Seasons Restaurant.  And then dining with Barry Diller.  Ooh.  Who's eating with who?  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip.  Do you think he...  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip? 
[03:31:30]  Do you think he ever wanted to write real news?  Of course he did.  And he ended up there.  The henhouse.  Fucking metorosexual jizzbag.  Leggy Courtney Cox, where she's shopping.  She's leaving a midtown office.  There's a photo of Courtney Cox leaving a building.  That's what you do as a journalist.  Look!  She's walking!  Ka-chitting!  Howie Mandel, host of NBC's Deal or No Deal, introducing himself to Yankees pitcher Randy Johnson.  At Patsy's. 
[03:32:00]  How is that?  Did the Times cover that?  The Times must have covered that.  So, anyway.  What's that address again, Jimmy?  He's got a chick job.  The address, if you know this gentleman, it's richard.johnson at nypost.com.  I'm sure that plenty of the people in PalTalk might know this gentleman.  Maybe you have some friends that know him and can get some serious answers from serious inquiries.  And maybe if any of you could call him, if you know him, we'd appreciate that, too, because you might know and be friends with him. 
[03:32:30]  We've had it with the Post, by the way.  We know John Minnelli is a friend of ours.  John's great.  He's listening to us right now.  He does what he can.  But we've had it with the fucking New York Post.  When we got fired for the Sex for Sam thing, we were on the front page looking really, really stupid.  Dopey and opie fired, whatever the official headline was.  And then we finally make it back to terrestrial radio.  It was a huge story all across America.  And they buried it way deep in the paper.  It was a small little article on a page that had six or seven other items. 
[03:33:00]  Spiest scumbags.  And again, dopey and pervy pal.  Oh, yeah, and they came up with dopey and pervy pal.  Go blow.  We've just had it with the New York Post.  That's what I say.  Oh, such language.  I know.  So, all right.  Why don't we move on?  We got Jimmy...  Fuck Richard Johnson.  Yeah.  Fuck him and his fucking ass.  Wear a house dress.  He has fucking clown shoes.  A house dress and fucking rollers in your hair.  Like a broad.  And stand in somebody's backyard and hang up sheets and laundry while you're kvetching and gossiping over the fence. 
[03:33:30]  You fucking wash woman.  Fucking cunt.  Had a dream to be a real journalist and that's what you're doing?  Walking around with an open blazer?  What?  Yeah, just to change the subject.  Yeah.  Apparently, this was left on Danny's keyboard.  Was this left on your keyboard, Danny?  It absolutely was. 
[03:34:00]  Hey, a wireless mic was handed to someone and it worked.  Very good.  It says, meet me in the stairwell for a cig in ten minutes.  Bobby.  With...  And this is after he came into the studio.  I was working in and asked me politely if he could blow me.  Did he really?  Yes.  And then did he say no homo?  No, actually.  He did not say no homo.  Why would he?  Danny said yes.  He couldn't say no homo with a mouthful of Danny Cuck. 
[03:34:30]  It's just not funny anymore.  I know.  It's really just over the room.  Yeah, I'm just ready to say the guy's gay.  We get it, Bobby.  It's not funny anymore.  Stop.  He's been toiling with it for a while now.  And now that it's been brought out, he's more comfortable with becoming more gay.  He's a gay guy.  What's next?  A bunch of tranny jokes?  Think about it.  Think about the percentage of gay people in this country and in this city, which is even  more so than the countrywide average. 
[03:35:00]  How many guys are in this studio on any given day?  A certain percentage must be gay.  They say 10%, Anthony.  10%.  10%.  So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  10.  All right.  We got like 10 guys working here.  That's 20%.  At least one guy is gay.  And that was Travis anyway.  But now how does it...  We're going to be over the percentage here.  You are.  Yeah, 65.  Really?  I don't know if I'm breaking any news to you or anything, Bobby. 
[03:35:30]  You're gay.  I don't think...  You're a gay guy.  I don't think I'm gay.  No, well, you might not think you are.  You might be like working it out in your head or something.  Wait, wait, Jimmy.  You need a mic?  I'd rather Jimmy have the wireless than stupid Bobby.  Jimmy has left the studio again.  Jimmy will get a mic.  All right.  But you're gay.  You're a gay guy.  You're getting more comfortable with it, which is good.  You're able to express it more because it's been brought out.  But it's so obvious you're gay. 
[03:36:00]  Okay.  I didn't, you know, probably not.  Probably.  I don't think I'm gay.  I don't feel gay.  You don't feel gay?  No.  By the way, I just want to interrupt.  Yeah.  Jimmy went into the bathroom.  Yeah.  And he has page six with him.  From the New York Post.  Oh, no.  Jimmy, you got page six with you?  No, I dropped it.  Somebody bring it to me immediately.  Get it quickly, quickly.  He's going to need it really quick.  Hurry up, hurry up.  There's the New York Post.  Just give him page six. 
[03:36:30]  Here we go.  All right.  Get page six for him.  Make sure it's the right page.  Anyway, back to Bobby.  It's on its way in for you, Jimmy.  You okay?  Yeah.  He's just handed me the whole post.  Thanks.  He asked for page six.  He gives me the whole fucking paper.  He has to be fired, even though he's getting paid nothing.  Give him page six.  I got to hear what this sounds like.  Jimmy's tribute to page six.  I want to hear it.  And Richard Johnson.  What do you want to hear?  I mean, I want to read it.  I want to do, like, serious business here.  All right. 
[03:37:00]  Mm-hmm.  Ooh.  Well, if it was handed to me open, this would be a little bit easier, but God forbid he  could find page six.  It's not on page six.  Isn't that odd?  I know.  Sixteen.  It's irony.  Wow.  He's reading.  This ought to be a really bad one.  They say.  Wow. 
[03:37:30]  Oh, my God.  That was a cup of water being poured into a toilet.  That didn't come out of your ass.  But it did.  Jimmy, you are really ill.  I know.  You've got a sour stomach.  I have a sour stomach. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, God.  Are we done with Bobby?  We just know he's gay.  Yeah, Bobby, I just wanted to tell you, you know, accept it, work with it, whatever you  need to do.  It's kind of like a joke.  It's like, my no homo is my claim to fame.  It's like Mike Barrett's, so.  Why did you want to meet with Danny in the stairwell?  Because I didn't have a cigarette, and I figured.  By the way, for a cig.  Yeah.  For a cig.  For a cig.  And what was the sucker?  Oh, yeah, this is after he wanted to blow me.  Well, I was kidding, and then you shut the door, and I said, no homo, as you shut the  door.  Bobby, weren't you the champ?  I was the champ. 
[03:38:30]  How the mighty have fallen.  Yeah, it happens.  Wow.  You don't smoke?  Well, I've taken it up recently.  I figured, you know.  He doesn't even smoke, Anthony.  But it's a good way to, like, bond with the guys, because all the guys here smoke.  Yeah, I sometimes.  So it's a good way to get, like, in the group with them.  Yeah, sometimes I'll have a cigarette, so I just figured.  A cig.  That's a little trickle.  So, Jimmy.  Hi, Ope.  I hear a little trickle.  This is the messiest show ever. 
[03:39:00]  Don't mind me, guys.  I don't want to interfere.  I'm just reading.  Okay.  All right.  Are we done with Bobby?  He's got a lot of air time today.  Yeah.  Bobby, congrats, and have fun with it, and whatever you need to do, that's fine.  Okay.  I'm still figuring it out, so.  Yeah, work it out.  Work it out with yourself.  Don't touch me.  Take it easy.  Don't think it's funny to play no homo and make it.  Oh, boy.  Because it'll be the last time you play no homo.  I hope he'll hit you and then say no broken jaw.  I will be the guy that has to hit him.  I'm amazed no one else has hit him. 
[03:39:30]  I think Van would have, but he wasn't sure what the protocol is if he would have got fired or not.  Well, the thing is, see, now there's a problem, though.  If he does go homo and come out and say he's gay, now you can't hit him.  Hate crime.  Because it's a hate crime.  Oh, great.  Now he's just an asshole who's kind of going around harassing people.  And using the word sig.  And funny.  Yeah.  Sig.  Great.  And just kind of being like the goofy, let's goof on gay people.  Wait a minute.  So he hits on me. 
[03:40:00]  I hit him because I hate that he's hitting on me.  Hate crime.  Yeah.  It's a hate crime.  Right.  Because he's, like, gay.  Great.  Now you could probably, we might be able to get a bitch slap in on him now.  But not a full closed fist because he's kind of gay.  Great.  Jimmy, we're trying to play your first call into the program.  Oh.  Are you going to come back in here?  I could be right here and hear it.  You want to do it this way?  I'd be on the mend if you want.  I don't have much more left. 
[03:40:30]  Did you just grunt?  I think I did.  Nothing came out?  I'm losing electrolytes.  Drink some Gatorade or something.  Yeah.  Let's go to Doyle in Michigan.  Doyle.  Hey.  How's it going?  Hey, Doyle.  Hey, Doyle.  Hey, I'd like to remind you guys that in England they call a cigarette a fag.  Yeah.  He might just be out there wanting more than just a cigarette with this guy.  Meet me in the stairwell for a fag in ten minutes, Bobby. 
[03:41:00]  See?  Maybe he meant that.  Hmm.  Well, we got something to play then.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation.  Hello and welcome to Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags, or as they call them in  America, cigarettes.  We have Bob the Fag Man with a very special box of very special fags today.  Yes, indeed.  We have a big box of big fags.  They call them cigars in America.  Yes.  Around the world, of course.  But we like to call them big fat fags. 
[03:41:30]  That's right.  The nice thing about big fat fags is they're more specialised.  Right.  You don't just find them lying about wherever.  Right.  But you go to a special shop and they're all there.  They all sort of hang out and all.  Kind of a fag shop.  Sort of like, right, there's like on display and you go through and you look and you smell  and you taste and you see which fag you want.  Which fag is for you.  Which fits your nice, you know, right in your mouth in a big way.  Right.  Or a smaller fag that might just slip right in your mouth.  It might feel nice, yeah.  Right, right, right.  Anyway, it's wonderful.  Bob, again, this has been a tremendous and very educational program. 
[03:42:00]  And that box of fags is for you.  Oh, no, I couldn't accept.  Oh, look at those beautiful fags.  We'll all share in them after the show.  Thank you so much, Bob, for being here.  I'll join us again next time on here on Facebook.  All right, very, very good.  Jimmy, get back in here.  Okay, Opie, I'm trying.  Oh, is he fleshing?  Yeah, because we want to play Jim's first call into the show.  I guess Dice was in studio.  Yeah.  Dice was in studio and he got us to call Jim Norton.  I think we were on the phone. 
[03:42:30]  Huh?  Was Dice on the phone?  We were on the phone.  Oh.  Oh, Dice was on the phone too?  I'm buckling my pants, Opie.  I almost remember Dice being in studio and saying,  You got to hear this guy.  Oh, maybe.  I'll call him.  Than, in studio.  Oh, okay.  Lucky you.  Yeah, he's on the phone and then calls Jim.  Okay.  He's also on the phone.  Is this good quality?  It's pretty good, yeah.  Because it came from a listener.  No, as listener audio goes, it's very good.  That's pretty good?  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy, we want to start when you get in here. 
[03:43:00]  Okay.  I'm gurgling again.  Oh.  You are a mess.  Jim in Sacramento.  Jim.  Hi.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  What's up, Jim?  Hi.  So, Bobby's a fag.  I mean, I'm a gay gentleman in Sacramento.  And you have to play those games if you like the car.  Yeah.  Period.  That's what it seems like.  You know, well, even I, I'm sorry, I've never played those games, but that's a little 
[03:43:30]  fucking weird.  Yeah, I don't really get it.  I don't get it.  As a gay gentleman, I don't get it either.  I don't fucking understand it, because I've never played games like that, but the guys that  I've known who have done it, you know, have ended up finally coming out, and you know.  Right.  I think he's on his way out.  It's getting more comfy for him.  Yeah, I think he's opening a door slowly, and he's got a big fucking flag behind it.  I don't think he's opening it slowly if he's hitting on every single guy that works for  the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah, it sounds like he's using, like, blasting dynamite.  You know?  All right.  Yeah, it's just, it's fucked up.  But, you know, congratulations on your deal, too, you know.  Thanks.  We'll get you out here in Sacramento.  Yeah, we've got to get out to Sacramento eventually.  Thanks, Jim.  We better get to this call shortly.  We have a very small window here.  Are you kidding?  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  By the way, I've got to sell some T-shirts for my brother.  He came out with a brand-new brown short-sleeve Opie and Anthony T-shirt.  Ooh.  The slogan is, the virus is spreading. 
[03:44:30]  It's vintage, so it's all beat up.  Yeah, we got the idea from the one you had made for Lucky Louie.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I thought you were going to say you got the idea from Jimmy's underwear.  Brown and beat up.  And they're already going fast, so go to MyRadioStore.com to get the Opie and Anthony T-shirts.  The brand-new one is up there, short-sleeve.  It looks really, really cool.  And thanks to Ziggy and the gang over at MyRadioStore.com, okay?  All right, here we go.  The first time Jimmy was on, the Opie and Anthony program finally getting to the tape.  We've been looking for this for a very long time. 
[03:45:00]  Years in the making.  All right, here it is, the first bit of audio.  No, you don't just take the day off to take the day off.  We defend ourselves.  No, it was him, wasn't it?  Some threats were made.  We responded in kind this morning.  Threats from the other guy, right?  Yeah.  Oh, we should set this up.  We should set this up, Anthony.  We had Dice on the phone.  And I guess we took a day off prior. 
[03:45:30]  It wasn't our choice.  Yeah.  We got into another scuffle with Howard Stern.  Oops.  And didn't listen to the bosses again.  And we were told to take the day off and think about it.  Yeah.  So now we're back on the program the next day.  And Dice happened to call in that day.  Of course, you'll hear him kissing our ass through this whole phone call.  No, you don't just take the day off to take the day off.  We defend ourselves.  No, it was him, wasn't it?  Some threats were made. 
[03:46:00]  We responded in kind this morning.  Dice from the other guy, right?  Yeah.  That's not right.  See, that's what I was talking about the other day.  Right.  This is why I don't bother with a guy like that.  What does he care if you guys are number one?  You tell me.  We're trying to figure that out.  You know what I mean?  What does that mean to his?  See, I'm the type of guy when I see another guy.  Wait a minute.  Can I call my opener?  Yeah.  Can I call my opener?  You never spoke to him.  I heard he had a couple hookers last night anyway. 
[03:46:30]  That's all he cares about.  He doesn't even care about getting paid.  He just wants girls to like him.  All right.  Give him a call.  You know what his whole chant is?  Please let one girl like me.  That's all he cares.  That's Jim Norton.  That's all he cares about is getting the mule out and getting it emptied.  I hear he's funny.  Hold on a minute.  I'll get him in one second.  Hey, that is so weird.  We have no clue who you are at this point.  I said I hear he's funny.  Yeah.  I don't know anything about you.  And he defined you perfectly.  Perfectly. 
[03:47:00]  How long ago?  This is January.  No, this is probably 2000, right, man?  This is about 2000.  Six years ago?  Well, I was around for 9-11.  I think I was a part of the show by 9-11 because I remember calling in from Jersey that day.  Yeah.  That's always like the reference point.  About five years ago.  Yeah, before anything.  Wow.  Okay.  So Jim says hello for the first time in this clip.  Wow.  Jim?  Yes?  Yeah, you're on with Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  Yeah, I put your mule down a minute. 
[03:47:30]  How you guys doing?  Pretty good, Jim.  Good.  I can hardly hear you.  What do you mean you can hardly hear him?  Don't act like you're not funny now.  No, I can hear them.  I can't hear.  Don't disappoint me.  You're on the air.  Can you hear us now?  See, this is what I do.  You see, I bring my openers on.  Yeah.  Right?  And I don't even call him an opener.  He's like my featured act.  This guy's been with me for two years.  I push his career.  See, that's the thing.  I like to see other people making it.  In my opinion, there's room for everybody. 
[03:48:00]  And I think that's the problem in your case, that the other guy don't want to see nobody make it.  Yeah.  And that's wrong.  That's accurate.  I could agree with that.  You know what I mean?  Sure.  You know what I mean, Jim?  Don't I always push you?  You help me get laid, and that's what I like.  You do push my career, but you do help me get laid.  Tell him what you look like.  I don't need to know what he looks like.  Tell him what a pity it is to be you.  I'm 5'7".  Every time I see a wow sticker, I lift my shirt.  Yeah, you got man boobs. 
[03:48:30]  You got the man boobs.  Yeah, I should be wearing a bra with a pistol in my mouth.  Oh, man.  You got the man boobs, and Dice has the old man balls.  No, Dice is very handsome.  Wow, this is really weird.  This is really weird.  You don't know Jimmy.  I don't know you at all.  He's all new.  I don't know how to interact with him.  And that was your first joke on the show.  Yeah.  I'd have said, oh, Jimmy, you're not like that.  I would say, good point, Ant, good point.  Be good to yourself.  First reference, a hooker, and I have fat tits and should kill myself. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  This call could have happened two days ago.  I was going to say that.  You made me do it.  I'm fucking.  If you weren't shitting yourself today, you would have said that exact thing.  I'm one trick chip.  One of the people hate me.  It's been working the same joke for five years.  It's fucking awful.  If I actually got in shape, I would just come on there quiet and nothing to say.  If I didn't have to shit today, do you realize this is what I contributed?  I fucked with diarrhea.  Yeah, you contributed water out of your ass today. 
[03:49:30]  That is really funny.  That was good, though.  Very funny.  And Dice taking stabs at Howard Stern.  Yeah.  Ah, but now they're buddies.  Now they're buddies.  Dice sort of a bull in the china shopping right there, too.  Yeah.  Not a lot of, you know, that's Norton's first appearance, but boy, that's.  We got more tape here.  Yeah.  Here we go.  More of Norton's first appearance.  Sorry.  More of Norton's first appearance on the Opie and Anthony program.  Yeah, that's what he did.  Very handsome.  Chiseled chin and blue eyes. 
[03:50:00]  Very good looking.  You know, I had a fight on the radio the other day with some woman.  She got mad that I kept saying I was handsome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you know that, Norton?  No, I didn't hear her.  What was it?  She called in.  I don't know.  Some stupid housewife.  Well, women are stupid anyway.  They're annoying.  What do you mean they're annoying?  You love women.  I like prostitutes.  You like prostitutes?  I like prostitutes.  I received oral treats from one last night.  $40, 48th, and 10th.  It was very nice.  Yeah?  Really?  Yeah. 
[03:50:30]  Was there any sniffing involved?  No, I don't sniff the backsides of prostitutes.  That's degrading.  But a regular girl, I'll sniff her backside, but not a prostitute.  But what's the thrill in that?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's just wrong.  I mean, you never spoke to these guys.  These guys don't know you.  Yeah, we're trying to know.  I just like it.  I don't know why.  Because the look back they give you, probably.  The look back a woman gives you when you're back there, you're just...  You know, they're just...  What are you doing now?  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little sniff sound.  Do the sample.  Do the sniff sound.  I don't know if they can hear it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we can hear it.  It smells like a dog in heat. 
[03:51:00]  Oh, I like it, though.  Sometimes there's a little tinkle in there.  It's nice.  And the first tinkle reference.  I'm just amazed we got away with this on regular FM radio.  That was New York only.  That was before syndicated.  Yeah.  That was when we were flying under the radar.  There was a time we flew under the radar.  Amazing.  Now all eyes are on us.  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  It's just so weird to hear.  I know.  Prostitutes.  Tinkle.  Sniffing of the ass.  Jesus, have I not grown?  No. 
[03:51:30]  You like the prostitutes?  Love.  Love.  Yeah?  He's into prostitutes.  He's heavy into the tinkle situation.  Yeah.  The golden shower?  Yeah.  He had two of them come over and use him as their toilet.  The night of the Roxy, yeah, in L.A.  I was depressed.  I couldn't meet a girl after the show, so I called two escorts.  And they wouldn't do anything for like $300.  They were just to show up.  Yeah.  So I wound up just, you know, masturbating like a lab animal with baby oil while they just  looked at me.  That's true.  That's what happened.  They wouldn't do anything for like, they wanted like $500 a piece to have sex. 
[03:52:00]  So I just did that and made them watch me.  And then they left unhappy.  Tell me he's not the perfect opener for me.  Yeah, I believe him.  But he kills every show.  He kills.  That's Jim.  Do that bit.  Do that bit.  What bit?  What bit?  Can you do any bits for him?  Yeah, do a bit.  I'm not even prepared for bits.  I didn't have anything written down.  What do you mean written down?  You're supposed to be a comic.  I told you.  If I ever call you and I'm on the air to be prepared.  How many times did I tell you that, huh? 
[03:52:30]  How many times does Club Soda Kenny tell you that?  Be prepared.  I should follow his own advice.  Let them talk.  They run the show.  Let them talk.  Yeah, now you're a comic, right?  Yes.  You work with Dice.  Yes.  You should be prepared.  No, he is absolutely the greatest stand-up that's ever been in front of me.  Oh, yeah.  I just absolutely, hands down.  I just don't have disprepared.  You know, I talk about hookers.  That's what I talk about.  And sometimes it turns people off.  That's why I don't do a lot of radio, because I want to talk about prostitutes,  and they don't want to hear it.  Wow.  I gave Dice a good one there. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  Take your own advice.  Be prepared when you call our show.  And I reprimanded you, Jimmy, a little bit.  Hey, you're a comic.  You should have material.  And to my credit, I had no bit prepared for the radio.  I didn't do bits even back then.  No, you didn't.  You sound nervous, and you're talking a lot faster.  Oh, yeah, I was.  You're getting every word in there.  Dice was yelling at you.  Dice is yelling at you.  Dice doesn't yell at Jimmy anymore.  No way.  Jimmy's not going to say this, but Jimmy now sells a lot more tickets than Andrew Dice Clay.  Of course. 
[03:53:30]  I, uh, that's, you know.  Yeah.  You did a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why are you giving me the thumbs up?  I'm actually going to use it to plug my asshole.  All right.  We're listening to the first time Jim called our show.  Let's listen to this.  You're going to see this guy when he gets out of the pool.  Yeah.  Why?  He gets in the pool.  He gets excited just getting in the pool, this guy.  Why is that?  I go with white swim trunks, and I tear out the lining. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, Jesus.  So your junk is prominently displayed.  Yeah, nicely.  Would you call it junk?  Yeah, we call it junk.  You know, that's a great name for what's inside.  I call it garbage.  Because it's like I was getting ready to blow my garbage all over this chick's back.  Can I say that?  Yeah, you just did.  All right, but it wasn't dumped or anything, right?  No, no.  You could say dumped.  Oh, hey, here's this.  I'm ready to dump my garbage.  Yeah.  On this chick's back. 
[03:54:30]  And she's looking at me going, why do you want to do it on my back?  So I said, because your face don't appeal to me.  You do that joke now, Anthony.  No, that's okay.  You did it good.  Do it.  Let me hear it.  You did it good.  Do it for me now.  And I'm not.  And I'm not.  You did it good.  Pretty good for you.  You, you, you.  Goodie good.  Don't know.  I was doing it.  I'm not going to go along with the bit because you didn't do it for me.  I didn't want to do it because it was awful.  Let's just be honest here. 
[03:55:00]  It was an awful bit.  Jimmy, why do you want to?  With the chick voice he used to do.  And Jimmy.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  Oh, nothing.  He's crossing his legs.  Can't we at least get through it one bit before you have to leave the studio?  And dude, we got an actor from the Poseidon.  He's going to come in next.  Can you please interview him from the past?  It's true.  Please.  We'll make believe it's a phone call.  It'll be worse than the tidal wave.  All right. 
[03:55:30]  We'll make believe it's a phone call.  Let's get my picture first.  All right.  Here we go.  Just a couple more clips from Jimmy's first appearance on our show.  Oh, okay.  All right.  So what I'm saying is, you see, I take a guy like Norton.  I put him out there.  I try to let the world hear his name so he doesn't always have to be the opener.  So here's the point I'm making that his career progresses and he gets to where he wants to go.  So I understand you had a problem because I'm on the air talking about a carpet head, you know. 
[03:56:00]  And he drew like a fit like in a deli in New York, something like that.  Now, why would he get mad at that?  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  But what I don't want you guys to do is fight because that's what he wants.  That's his whole thing is to knock people in that down.  Like I know this guy has fallen through the cracks already.  You know what I mean?  Nobody calls in.  Nobody wants to talk to him.  You know what I mean? 
[03:56:30]  He alienated everybody.  But we shouldn't be like that.  We don't do that.  We're not going to kick a guy when he's down.  Okay?  Well, some people.  What a fucking asshole.  Yikes.  He's, of course, talking about Howard Stern in that clip.  Yeah.  And when we were down, he had no problem kicking us all over the place.  Yeah.  All over the place.  What a fucking hypocrite.  As a matter of fact, you know what we should do, Jim? 
[03:57:00]  Yes.  I don't know.  I'll leave this up to you.  When we do the gig, I'm going to announce the gig next probably Wednesday on Aubrey and  Anthony where we're going to be in New York.  Okay.  Maybe, I can't put him on after you.  Maybe we let him do a few minutes before you.  Maybe when we put him on, we start building him up again.  You know what I mean?  The other guy.  You don't say his name.  I don't know who you're talking about.  Yeah. 
[03:57:30]  Well done.  He's got a nose like a condominium, and he's got a weaved head.  Who is it?  Oh, jeez.  Spike in Chicago, what's up?  Yeah, I want to give Anthony credit for that joke.  I don't think he got enough laughs about the Poseidon Adventure tidal wave.  Oh, well, nah.  I didn't think it was that good.  Kind of a throwaway.  I didn't even hear it.  I liked it.  I really didn't hear it.  Yeah, I'll have to listen on the replay.  Yeah, listen on the replay. 
[03:58:00]  I really didn't hear it.  It's fun that way.  All right.  I know.  You listened to the replay.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you all right?  Mm-hmm.  Anything to add to this?  Yeah, it's good to hear.  It's weird, right?  Yeah, he's really loving.  Jimmy's really loving his first appearance.  That's right.  It's weird, huh?  Yeah, it's weird.  What did we see in him?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Here's what happened.  When I came back in the next time, when I came in for the first time and I almost laughed.  Shut up.  Don't explain yourself.  I have to.  After this, people are going to think that I have photos of you guys blowing each other for  you to hire me.  Why would this guy have ever gotten on staff after this abomination of a call? 
[03:58:30]  Bad.  The little joke.  The hookers.  Hi.  Because I came in.  I had a good appearance when I was in the studio.  You had a great appearance.  Frantic Fran.  I remember that I was trying to shut up Dice because I wanted to hear you more.  I remember that like it was yesterday.  Dice is babbling.  Dice did great radio for us.  We're not going to sit here and make believe he didn't.  He's doing the whole make believe now on Howard Show, but the reality is we did great radio  with Dice.  But he had a tendency of babbling at times and you had to kind of shut him down. 
[03:59:00]  And I remember Jimmy was just killing when Frantic Fran was in.  She was like 80 something years old and she had her boyfriend in there and they were talking  about banging each other and she's playing the piano and it was just a crazy day.  And Jimmy was on fire and Dice kept babbling.  I'm like, shh, shh, because I wanted to hear you.  I remember that like it was yesterday.  Definitely.  All right.  This is the wrap up of Jimmy's first call on the O.P. and Anthony show.  All right.  Listen, Dice, we got to go.  What do you mean?  Why?  Because we got to go.  No, we just really do. 
[03:59:30]  What are you going to do now?  We're going to do some stuff.  Really?  We got things.  You want me to leave Jim on the air?  We got things.  I don't know.  I think Jim wants to go find a hooker.  Well, I'm going to see my ex-girlfriend.  I'm going to go see my ex-girlfriend in like 40 minutes.  Oh, yeah?  What are you going to do with her?  I don't know.  This is just how much you get a Brazilian wax.  Did you ever hear that?  Yeah.  They wax everything.  Everything.  Really?  Balloon, not everything.  So you're going to check it out?  Even like the little cork spot in the middle?  Even that part? 
[04:00:00]  Everything.  And that's nice.  That's nicey-nice.  Oh, no.  Well, I got to thank you guys.  All right.  You know what I mean?  All right.  So I'll call you next week.  All right, Dice.  Okay?  All right.  Everything's good for everybody.  Nah, nah.  Good for everybody.  I'm over here now.  And now you can rip me apart when I hang up.  All right.  All right, Dice.  All right.  Hey, Jim, thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Take it easy.  Jim, hang on.  I'm going to talk to you now a minute.  All right.  I got to straighten a few things out with you.  All right.  All right.  Take care, guys.  All right, man.  We got to start charging him for these sessions. 
[04:00:30]  Wait, hold on.  What?  I'm just taking a break.  Whoa.  Whoa.  We got to start charging.  My God.  We're his therapist.  I really think so.  All right.  I was waiting for you guys to go, he, that guy stinks.  Who is the guy, Jim, with him?  That's what I was hoping.  I actually was, too.  That would be really funny.  I was hoping that we just, like we do with everybody else, we just trash you or not even  get your name right.  Who is that guy, John, that you called? 
[04:01:00]  I'll tell you something.  If we didn't, excuse me, if we didn't trash you, that means there was something there that  kind of just piqued our interest.  Stop.  I'm telling you.  Dude, we would.  I'm kidding.  All right.  Because as soon as the person hung up, we would just go after him if they really stunk.  So, all right.  Josh Elliott in studio from ESPN.  We got Freddy Rodriguez from Poseidon coming in next to say hi to us.  And then hopefully we'll get out of here for the weekend.  Uh-huh.  All right.  You're listening to the Suen Sounds of Obi and Anthony. 
[04:01:30]  So sit back, relax.  Have yourself some herbal tea.  Close your eyes and drift away with O&A.  Hey, ass cock.  Hi.  This is great.  You dick.  Bye, bye, bye.  Shut up, shut up.  Fuck all y'all.  Horrific and tasteless.  It's called sarcasm.  I've never heard anything as offensive and gross as you are. 
[04:02:00]  And that's why I'm signing up.  The Anthony and Anthony Show.  The Anthony and Anthony Show.  California, rest in peace.  Time will take me up in peace.  California, show your teeth.  She's my priestess.  I'm your priest. 
[04:02:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Hey.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, hi, on XM Satellite Radio.  I've just decided to move my microphone to suit me, Opie.  I was laying back in my chair.  Yeah.  Relaxing.  And I was just going to sit up like I normally do and go to my microphone.  And then I decided, why not just let the microphone come to me?  Yeah, we're a little tired at this point. 
[04:03:00]  I got a quick phone call we got to get to.  Buddy O'Toole.  Buddy?  Not the Buddy O'Toole.  What's up, buddy?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys were going to do that thing, Money Snatch, that you guys  did in NEW a long time ago.  Hey, we love doing a Money Snatch, let me tell you.  Let me tell you something.  The first half of the O.B. and Anthony Show today, we did the mousetrap thing and the  ladies did not show up.  They let us down.  But, CBS Radio gave us $1,000 for the contest.  $1,000. 
[04:03:30]  This is what we're going to do, Anthony.  We're working for two companies now.  We now challenge XM to give us cold hard cash so we can do the Money Snatch game.  What a challenge.  Oh, no.  Let's move this along, Jimmy.  All right, so we asked Washington to give us money so we can do the Money Snatch game  right here exclusively on XM.  Yes.  Okay?  Give us money.  We'll have an update on that on Monday, buddy.  Talk to Elo.  All right, thanks, guys.  CBS gave us $1,000 today.  Let's see what XM gives us for Money Snatch. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  In studio, we got Big Kev helping us out and Freddy Rodriguez.  What's up, Freddy?  Hey, how you doing?  We got to explain something to you.  We've been doing radio since 6 this morning.  Oof.  We've been up since 4.15.  Oof.  So bear with us, okay?  No, you got it.  You got it.  We do like two shows.  We do two shows.  We do one for FM radio.  Right.  And then we do this for XM satellite radio.  Sounded great and looked great on paper and everything.  The reality of it, holy shit. 
[04:04:30]  I'm so tired every day.  Are you saying the check is not worth it?  Once you see the check.  No, maybe once we see a check.  Right.  That might help.  Whoa.  Right.  Open my eyes up and go, hey.  This is good.  See all the zeros, huh?  You're too tired to spend the money, Freddy.  That's the problem.  That's why I'm looking for it.  You watch the bank account go way up, but you can't even get to a bank.  Right.  Is Jimmy on the line?  Yes.  Jimmy.  Hey, Freddy.  How you doing?  Hey, Jimmy.  What's up, man?  How you feeling about the movie? 
[04:05:00]  I'm feeling good.  Feeling good.  You know, Wolfgang Peterson, big, big summer blockbuster.  So I'm excited about it.  Were you nervous, like, remaking a movie like that?  I mean, it's a classic.  Was I nervous?  No, I was excited.  I was excited because, you know, with today's technology and Wolfgang Peterson, I knew they  would do something special.  Yes, we're talking about Poseidon, of course.  Oh, yeah.  That's, uh...  That is...  Well, see, a couple of leaks are being sprung right here on this radio show. 
[04:05:30]  Yeah, you take a classic movie like Irwin Allen's The Poseidon Adventure, which at the  time was, like, cutting edge and fantastic.  Go see in the movies.  I remember a lot of people just loved it.  But it doesn't quite hold up to the test of time because of the effects and, you know,  how a storyline personalities change over time from the 70s and stuff.  This, of course, updated, modern-day cruise ship, and you got some CGI to work with to 
[04:06:00]  make it look really cool.  I've seen the trailer, and, you know, it makes me want to see the movie because it just looks  so cool, that wave hitting and the ship going over.  Looks like a real cruise ship, not like the Queen Mary, like the old Poseidon look.  And where do the similarities end, or do they, between the original as far as storyline goes?  Well, you know, the only thing that's the same is the premise of the story.  You know, Rogue Wave hits a ship, ship flips over, people survive, they try to get out. 
[04:06:30]  That's the only thing that's the same.  You know, the thing that's cool about this film is that once the wave hits the boat and,  you know, people form teams to get out of the boat, it goes into fifth gear from there,  and it's just fast-forward, man.  It's just all facts, all action.  You know, it's not, you know, people don't stop in the middle of that and have a love  scene or, like, you know.  Great character development.  And the only Winters having that heart attack.  No, man, it's not that.  You know, it's...  Take care of the grandchildren. 
[04:07:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  And do they follow different groups of people?  Because the Poseidon Adventure, the original one, you just followed, like, that one group,  and you were wondering, you know, hey, what the hell happens on the rest of this huge ship  with any survivors?  No.  Jimmy?  No, you know, there are about two teams that are formed.  Right.  And so you follow the two teams, and then eventually the two teams come together and, you know,  try to get out.  But, you know, what's cool about this film is that it's as avid... 
[04:07:30]  It's...  Ah, excuse me.  It's early.  If it was you, like, what would you do, right?  That's what it's about.  It's not, you know, there's no, like, development, character development, none of that.  It's what you would really do if you were put in this position.  It's like you're on a cruise, you're having a damn good time, and then, holy shit, you're  put in this position.  Now what do you do?  Exactly.  Some people, I guess, step up to the occasion.  Other people's turn into, what, pussies?  Just shit.  Blithering.  Right, right.  Shit their pants, as Jimmy puts it. 
[04:08:00]  And, yeah.  Now your character.  Give us a little bit about that.  Yeah, I play this guy named Marco Valentine, and I'm the resident waiter on the ship.  And, you know, I'm trying to hook up with Mia Maestro's character.  And I sneak around the ship and get her into a room and get her food and trying to hook  up with her.  And then the wave happens, and so that doesn't happen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then it's you two trying to get out, or...  Yeah, yeah, we try to get out.  You hook up with one of the groups. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah, exactly, exactly.  You know, myself and Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss, and Kurt Russell form a team, and then her  character, Mike Vogel, and Emmy Rossum form a team, and they try to get out.  Uh, morning after?  Will we...  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Will we be hearing morning after?  No, no, you will not be hearing morning after that.  We're in a really bad position here, and I swear this is true.  We cannot turn off Jimmy's mic.  It's on a wireless, and we don't have a button to turn it off. 
[04:09:00]  Jimmy Norton is our third mic.  Right.  He's usually sitting right there.  Right.  And he is one of the co-hosts of the program.  He's having...  A brilliant comic, by the way.  If you notice, there are saltines and ginger ale there, which is the universal cure.  And Pepto.  And Pepto.  And a Gatorade to replace some electrolytes.  It's the universal medicine of people that have an upset tummy.  Right.  Jimmy's had an upset tummy for a while.  We didn't want to leave him out of any interviews today, so he's on a wireless in the restroom. 
[04:09:30]  So any sound you might hear is Jimmy.  He has a sour stomach.  How are you holding up, Jim?  Huh?  Okay.  I'm trying not to interrupt.  But for Jimmy, it feels like the bathroom is turned upside down, and he must now find  his way out.  I'm imagining Freddie didn't think it would go quite like this.  Your interview on XM Saturday Radio.  Big Hollywood star.  And would like to apologize for that. 
[04:10:00]  Oh, my God.  This has been for the last five hours, by the way.  Wow.  Five hours of this.  Did he eat something bad?  Supposedly, yeah.  He ate some type of sushi, bad, was it, no, Chinese food.  Chinese food.  He had bad Chinese.  He's blaming it on that, but it's been a couple of days now.  I don't know.  Wow.  I kind of feel bad for the guy.  I have a sour stomach.  He has a sour stomach.  But he's a trooper and, you know, trying to get through this.  Jimmy, do you have a legitimate question for Freddie Rodriguez? 
[04:10:30]  No, the CGI, how much different does it make it from the original flick?  I actually, I do want to see it because there's certain films they shouldn't remake, but a  film like this where it's like graphics driven.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, they could actually do a lot with it, you know, 25 years after the original.  Right, right.  Well, you know, imagine that the original was in the 70s and this is now.  So, you know, it's modern day technology in this film.  And then it's Wolfgang Peterson.  So, you know, you see all of his movies.  Like Anthony said, the preview looks unbelievable. 
[04:11:00]  Yeah, it looks really cool.  When does it come out?  When that trip goes over.  A couple more weeks?  Thursday, next Thursday.  Next Thursday already.  Yeah, yeah, next Thursday.  Now, where did they get you from?  What else have we seen?  Six Feet Under.  Yeah, I know, Six Feet Under.  Six Feet Under, yeah.  And July, I got a film coming out called Lady in the Water, M. Night Shyamalan film.  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, so that's next.  Is it all mysterious?  Yeah, you know, actually, this is a little bit strange.  No, that one's a little different.  It was a bedtime story he used to tell to his daughters that he decided to make in a film. 
[04:11:30]  So, it definitely has the M. Night Shyamalan, you know, touch to it.  Yeah.  But not like The Village or something.  How's he to work for?  He's great, man.  He's probably the most pleasant director I've ever worked for, man.  I'll do anything for him.  Yeah.  How'd you get into this whole thing?  What'd you do?  The normal route, high school plays, and then theater afterwards?  Right.  No, when I was 13, I started acting.  I actually went to an arts high school, and I majored in drama.  And then when I was 19, I did a film called Dead Presidents here in New York, actually, 
[04:12:00]  and A Walk in the Clouds, and those are my first two films, and that's what got me into the industry.  Nice, and now you're in one of these summer blockbusters.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Let's go to the phones.  Mike in Philly.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, man?  How you doing?  Good.  We're talking to Freddie Rodriguez.  What's up, Freddie, man?  Big Six Feet Under fan.  Oh, thank you, man.  Appreciate that.  I was wondering, what's the connection with that movie you were all in?  And Lauren Ambrose and the guy that played Jimmy, and then you all end up at that same 
[04:12:30]  show.  Yeah.  Is there some strange connections, different, like, same writers or something?  No, no, not...  Wait, explain this for us, because I don't really know...  He's talking about a film called Can't Harley Wait, which is a, you know, like a teenage  film that we all did back in the late 90s, and myself and Lauren Ambrose, who's a cast  member on Six Feet Under, and Eric Balfour, we were all in that film together, and it  was just weird, because then after that, you know, we all did Six Feet Under together.  But no, there was no correlation between the two projects.  It just is all pure coincidence, you know? 
[04:13:00]  But that film was cast by a woman named Mary Vernu, who is one of the biggest cast directors  in Hollywood, and her thing is always putting films together with up-and-coming actors, and  so she had the foresight to who was going to be big, I guess, and so, you know, now you  watch shows like Six Feet Under, and it sort of proves her theory on who she thought  was going to be big.  It's got to be odd.  You get on the show and go, hey, look at where we are.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  What happened here, guys?  Yeah, that film is cool.  It's like a Fast Times at Ridgemont High, you know, you watch that movie and you see all 
[04:13:30]  the people who blew up from that film, you know?  Wow, cool.  Rob on Long Island, what's up?  Yeah, I love Six Feet Under, buddy, man.  Is there any other thing you've done between that and this movie?  Yeah, yeah, I had a couple films out last year.  One was called Havoc with Anne Hathaway and Bijou Phillips, and I had another film with  Kurt Russell called Dreamer that was out last year, the sort of horse thing.  Dreamer.  I've got to definitely check them out.  Listen, the best part of the starting was looking up the actress that played Ernie 
[04:14:00]  for a nice wife with a big underwear hanging out.  Right.  You're talking about the original, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, there ain't going to be any like that because that's the best thing you've got me  to watch.  And he up the skirt shots when the ship flips over.  That's what I'm looking for.  You know, not quite like that, no.  All right.  Well, Freddie, I know you're going to have a great career ahead of you.  Thank you.  You're one of the best actors in the woods of the favorite Jimmy Morton.  You are phenomenal.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Thanks, Rob. 
[04:14:30]  How old are you, Freddie?  I'm 31.  Oh, okay.  You look younger, man.  Yeah.  You can't even see him.  Wow, really?  I've seen him before.  He looks much younger.  Oh, yeah, I get that.  I know.  He looks like a kid.  Jimmy, you have another question for Freddie Rodriguez?  No, I'm just trying not to interrupt.  Yeah, please.  That's a good actor, man.  I'm jealous.  I never know what to do with my hands when I'm acting.  Right.  Enough with the hands.  He's always talking about the hands because Jimmy does a little acting.  Why don't you ask Freddie, Jimmy?  I'm going to come back in when I'm done.  I'll make sure I wash up.  When I'm acting, I always just kind of stand stiff.  I never had to move naturally when I act. 
[04:15:00]  Right, right.  Yeah.  So his arms are always like kind of being held out and his shoulders are up a little.  And he's, so what do you think?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  You just got to relax, you know?  Just kind of relax and imagine what you would really do in the moment, you know?  Jimmy is nervous.  Jimmy downplays his acting.  He's going to be on HBO in a matter of weeks at this point.  The show's Lucky Louie.  Lucky Louie.  He's part of the Lucky Louie thing on HBO.  Oh, okay.  And I'm doing something for perverted justice.  I play perp number three. 
[04:15:30]  Perverted justice.  Is that a real show?  Yeah.  I think it's a website that apprehends the pedophiles.  Yeah, the pedophile dateline thing.  Oh, right, right, right.  It's the best reality show on TV.  Dennis in New York.  Show the fuck.  Yo.  What's up, Dennis?  Yo.  What's going on?  I just wanted to say something to Freddy Rodriguez.  Hey, what's up, Dennis?  How you doing, man?  All right, man.  Dude, that movie Havoc?  Yeah.  That movie you were in?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  A friend of mine recommended that to me.  I just wanted to say you were awesome in that movie, dude. 
[04:16:00]  Yeah, it was pretty crazy, huh?  Yeah, man.  I was.  Punching out.  That's it?  Well, what's the movie about, Kev?  It's about Anne Hathaway shaking that whole I'm a good girl image.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's what it was.  What makes the movie killer?  I've never heard of Havoc.  I've got to be honest.  Yeah, Steve Gagin wrote it.  He wrote Traffic, and Barbara Cople directed it, and she's a two-time Oscar winner.  And, you know, Anne Hathaway's nude in it, I'm nude in it, you know, that was, like,  sort of her attempt to shake off.  Jimmy.  Yes?  Freddy's nude in that movie. 
[04:16:30]  Dude, were you nervous doing a nude scene?  Yeah, absolutely, man.  It's highly uncomfortable.  Is it full frontal nudity?  No.  Oh, okay.  No, no, no, no.  Were you nude on set?  Yeah, yeah.  Did you get to rub your mule on her?  No, no, man.  None of that.  Did they put a sock on you, dude?  I heard that, like, when you do, like, sex scenes, they put, like, a male sock on the  guy to keep it from kind of rubbing up against her.  Yeah, that's true.  They do, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Wow.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, because you don't want, you know.  So you're doing a love scene, and they just cover up your area?  Yeah.  In the bed? 
[04:17:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy, how did you know that?  I've heard that before from other people, and I, uh...  Some girls have demanded it when he's sleeping with them, the prostitutes.  Put the sock on, kid.  Put the sock on, you disgust me.  Even though you're just, you're acting and stuff, do you just kind of try to plump it  up in the dressing room before the scene?  No, no, man.  Just a little bit?  No, no, not really.  They don't get a bad rep around Hollywood?  No, no.  He's hung.  It's probably one of the most uncomfortable things you could do, you know.  You're sitting there, and you think it's romantic, but it's like, you know, 30 other people on 
[04:17:30]  the set looking at you.  It's got to be awkward.  Well, Brandon said that when he did the last tango in Paris, he had to be nude, and he  said that it was like, he was packing like a half inch, and he was really embarrassed  on the set, because his hog was so small, because he was nervous being naked in front  of everybody.  Did he do anything about it, or no?  No, he said he was just mad, but it was like a peanut, or something like that.  I forget the word he used, but he was really embarrassed about it.  We've got a couple questions about the new Poseidon compared to the old Poseidon.  Scott in Connecticut, go.  Hey, I just want to know if any special effects, if they made the chairs stay in place after 
[04:18:00]  the ship rolls over like they did in the original one.  If you notice in the original, after the ship flips over, all the tables and chairs and even  some of the place settings are still in place when they show a picture of the ceiling,  which is now the floor, which is now the ceiling.  Right, right.  Someone screwed up, huh?  Well, no.  Oh, yeah, it's a riot.  Well, the tables and, like, I know in this film, the piano stays in place, but that's  because it's a ship, you know?  Yeah, they're bolted down, some of the stuff.  Yeah, right, yeah.  Yeah, little tables would be bolted down.  But the place settings, I mean, you know. 
[04:18:30]  Not place settings.  They're going to be nailed down.  Plates wouldn't be.  The forks, you know?  Right.  Yeah.  All right.  One more call here.  Let's say hi to Steve in Jersey.  Steve, what's up?  You hear that in the background.  Steve.  Yeah.  Let's go, Steve.  I just wanted a question.  I was wondering how the new movie takes into account, like, technological advances on the  ship, like GPS and fast and helicopters with the Coast Guard to a form of why they don't  get rescued right away. 
[04:19:00]  Yeah, I guess, like, in the 70s, wow, it might have taken a longer time for them to find the  ship.  Whereas here, you know, where is the ship supposed to be on the globe when this happens?  They don't say.  Atlantic, Caribbean, something like that?  No, they don't say.  Yeah, the ocean.  Somewhere?  Yeah, something like that.  It's not on land.  Yeah.  Oh, interesting.  Okay.  And then, yeah, you figure it flips over and the Coast Guard would be there within a couple  of minutes to help everybody out, but then the movie would be over. 
[04:19:30]  Right.  Yeah, you've got to get yourselves out.  And it's not the same thing where they've got to get to the propeller shaft part of the  back engine room because the hull is thinnest.  Do they keep that part of the plot?  Yeah, it's something like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's certain rooms that they've got to get through to try to get to the top, yeah.  Remember the kitchen scene being pretty brutal in the first one for its time, you know, with  the burnt up people, so.  Yeah, it's like that.  I'm expecting some.  That's, it's like that in this film, too.  Yeah, we look forward to this movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Poseidon.  Mission Impossible 3 starts today. 
[04:20:00]  You're going to go see Mission Impossible 3?  Yeah, I want to see that film.  I want to check it out.  That's your competition.  Yeah, yeah.  You're the movie that's going to take this one out next week.  Right.  I saw it last night.  Oh, yeah, it comes out.  It was pretty good.  You liked the big cab?  Oh, yeah.  The movie's not in.  He's here to plug his movie.  Why?  Just a quick plug.  I'm just as forward to that as I was to Mission Impossible 3.  Scientology?  You?  No.  No.  No, no, no.  Good guy.  Good guy.  I'll be honest with you.  I'd rather see Poseidon than Mission Impossible 3.  Why?  Yeah.  I never really got into the Mission Impossible series. 
[04:20:30]  Actually, I haven't even seen the first one yet.  Really?  And we're usually pretty on top of all the movies around here.  I think if you've seen the first one, you're pretty far from being on top if you haven't  seen the first one.  But I had no desire on that one.  None.  None whatsoever.  No.  Yeah.  Jim Norton, everyone.  There he is.  Back in the studio.  Hey.  You feeling okay now?  Oh, awful.  Dude, I don't know how so much liquid could come out of one human being.  You're going to be dehydrated.  Yeah.  That's right.  Electrolytes.  Drink some Gatorade now. 
[04:21:00]  Fuck Mission Impossible 3.  I'd rather see Poseidon than Mission Impossible 3.  Without a doubt.  Tom Cruise irritates me.  It's just I've seen the original.  I kind of want to see what they've done with it, and the trailer makes it look really kind  of cool.  Well, movies like that and Kong, if you're going to use CGI, that's the movies you should  use them for, is stuff where it's called for.  They're remaking a lot of films they don't need to, but anything with a movie like Titanic  or anything where there's disaster.  Right.  I want to see it these days.  Yeah.  You know what else?  When you can use the technology to update it, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what else I keep hearing is to see it at the IMAX. 
[04:21:30]  It's supposed to be like a really good...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They're showing it at the IMAX.  It's supposed to be a really cool experience.  You know, they have regular showings at the IMAX, you know?  I saw my first movie at an IMAX.  Not the dumb documentaries that they used the IMAX for in the beginning.  Remember we saw, what's his name, The Shark Hunter?  It was all they used to show, or the documentaries, yeah.  Or they climb Mount Everest.  That's terrific.  I want to see a movie.  Ooh, I feel like I'm here with them.  Go see Poseidon there, man, at the IMAX.  I will definitely do that.  We live kind of not too far from one, right? 
[04:22:00]  Yeah.  Let's definitely go.  I wouldn't ask you on a date all of a sudden, but I'd definitely like to see them on a fucking  massive screen.  You think you could sit through a movie?  Dude, yeah, you're right.  I'd have to bring a porta potty with you.  You're disgusting, man.  You'll be all right by next week.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I should be fine by tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, all right.  We should get out of here.  Looked great, man.  Thanks, and continued success.  Thank you.  Gonna enjoy watching this.  And you guys, too, man.  Congratulations on all the success.  Thank you.  Thank you, Freddie.  Sorry I had to interview you from the bathroom, but I wanted to be a part of it because I'm  psyched that you came in.  I'm glad you have a sense of humor and went with that.  Yeah.  Because other people from Hollywood would come in here and be like, oh, I can't be part 
[04:22:30]  of this.  No, I'm from Chicago, man.  Their publicist would drag them out like, oh, what kind of show is this?  Dude, I wish it was a hot chick, because a guy is usually not going to get freaked  out by another guy fucking, you know, every guy fucking loves log jokes.  It's just a guy thing.  It's a man thing.  You can't help it.  You know what I mean?  If you really wanted to fucking, you got to do it to a chick.  Get a beautiful girl in here.  It's so disgusting, but there's something so goddamn funny about hearing that sound.  It's fucking childhood giggles.  When I was six and I got yelled at for putting my ear by the bathroom when Teddy Clouser was 
[04:23:00]  making a doody.  That's what my son does, man.  Whenever my oldest son is taking a dump, like, he goes under the door and says, are you  doing number two?  They're fascinated with it.  There's something primal about it.  You can't fucking help it.  I love duty jokes.  What's funnier than hearing another man in misery?  You understand it was pure liquid out of my body.  I know.  It was really bad.  And it is kind of a thank God it's not me.  Better you than me.  Yeah.  What kind of fish did you have? 
[04:23:30]  I had, well, I had, well, I actually, it was actually Chinese food from this place.  I had chicken fried rice.  And it just didn't taste that great.  A little off?  Yeah, man.  It wasn't, it didn't taste bad, but it was like there was something, something, yeah.  Was there a place you've gone to before?  No.  I just had delivery because my regular Peter Grill place was not open that day.  I've told this story a couple times on the show.  When I was at BAB, I was living in Northport, and there was a Chinese restaurant there.  I swear to this day, I had a chicken dish.  I did not eat chicken. 
[04:24:00]  I swear to this day.  What are you thinking about it?  It's like cat?  I have no idea, but it just, it just did not taste or seem right at all.  Was the place Vietnamese?  No, it was just a Chinese restaurant in Northport, and they closed down shortly after that.  Like, I mean, I don't know what they were doing.  I don't know if they were falling on hard times and just decided to start cutting corners,  but I swear to you, to this day, I know I did not eat chicken that day at the Chinese restaurant.  And then I ended up having exactly what you're going through right now.  But as long as I'm not puking anymore, I was like vomiting and shit the first day, 
[04:24:30]  and that's the worst when you're throwing up.  It just tasted gamey.  It just tasted like...  It might have been dog.  Yeah.  Well, that's the obvious.  A lot of people say they do eat dog, and I don't know, but...  I like to do my scenes sitting.  We were talking about acting.  I like to sit when I do a scene, because then I can kind of be comfortable putting my hand somewhere,  but when I stand, I'm fucking finished.  Everyone I play should just be in a wheelchair.  I'd fucking win an Oscar.  Yeah, before we get out of here, let's say hi to Doug out Doug.  Doug!  What's up? 
[04:25:00]  We're counting on one of you guys to call the first part of the show on Monday to explain  the whole pest thing and how they get involved, okay?  You know I'm the kind of guy that's going to start calling late Sunday night.  We're at that point where we have to start explaining things to the people that haven't  heard us in a while.  I want the attention.  All right, what do you guys put up?  We'll be doing the WOW sticker stop tonight at the Virginia Beach Funny Bone for Rich Voss'  show.  I've never seen Rich before.  He is fucking hilarious.  Yeah, he's a really great stand-up, man.  Oh my God, I mean, I like him on the show, but he fucking kills live. 
[04:25:30]  You saw him last night?  Holy shit.  You saw him last night?  I saw him on Wednesday night.  Oh, Wednesday night, yeah.  I know.  You know, he gets a bad rap on this show, but we got to tell you, the guy kills.  Absolutely.  The guy is, and Bonnie.  Bonnie is incredible.  When she says the word cunt and the crowd just collectively gasps, I mean, Rich, man,  Rich was awesome.  He saw a bunch of, we had a bunch of pests there giving out stickers and we were hanging  out.  Rich was cool as shit.  He worked in a couple of no homos and stuff just for us. 
[04:26:00]  It's great when there's like only 10 people laughing at something and no one else knows  what's going on.  Right.  But we'll be at the Virginia Beach Funny Bone giving out stickers at 7 o'clock tonight.  Virginia Beach, Virginia, 757-213-5555 for tickets.  Thank you, gentlemen.  And did you hear, Doug, did you hear our thing with Richard Johnson at the New York Post?  No, he hung up.  Okay.  Oh, you know he used to.  No, I didn't hang up.  What's that?  Well, you want to explain again or you want to go?  Just on the replay, you might have to hear.  It's just the guy from the...  Quite frankly, Doug, we've had it with the New York Post, so we want the pest to get involved. 
[04:26:30]  And maybe some of them...  Richard Johnson.  Richard.Johnson.  Page six has blown us off for many, many years.  That's okay.  Whatever.  But, you know, there's obviously something going on with the New York Post and the Opie  and Anthony show, and we finally had it.  We tried to get him on the show, and he hung up on Ben, so it's Richard.Johnson at NYPost.com.  I thought maybe one of you guys might know him, and just give him a very, very serious,  of course, inquiry and ask him what's going on.  You'll hear it on the replay.  Jimmy just went off, and that was the final straw for Jimmy. 
[04:27:00]  For me, it was when we made our return back to commercial radio, and they buried the story  deep in the paper on a page that had many, many other articles, and the headline was  Dopey and Pervy Pal back on radio.  But they had no problem throwing us on the front page when we fucked up really bad.  They didn't mention Anthony?  They just mentioned the Pervy Pal?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Pervy Pal.  Pervy Pal.  That's Jimmy, isn't it?  Exactly.  And when we returned to commercial radio, it was a big story.  All the other papers gave it, you know, proper placement, and we appreciated that. 
[04:27:30]  Daily News was all over it, and the Post obviously buried it because they have some kind of problem  with us, so we've had it with them.  Can't this conversation continue on like pal talk or something?  Yes, they will respect you.  Because I want to get out of here.  Bond number nine, punching out.  Take it easy.  Bye, sweetie.  All right.  Let's say hi to Tom.  Tom?  Hey, what's up, boys?  What's up?  Well, you're talking about the Chinese joint.  There was a Chinese joint over here in Teaneck by me.  There was this lady.  They called her the squirrel lady.  She used to feed all these squirrels, hundreds of them, then 50, then 10. 
[04:28:00]  She calls a board of health.  They go into the Chinese joint, squirrel carcasses hanging in the walk-in freezer.  Holy cow.  Yeah, man.  Punch it out.  All right.  Thank you.  I have no doubt that that goes on from time to time at some places.  No doubt.  I'm sure it does.  All right.  We've got to thank Freddy Rodriguez for stopping by.  Poseidon opens up next weekend.  You guys don't need the help.  You're just here to say hi, obviously.  That movie's going to do ridiculous numbers.  And Richard Dreyfuss we have sometime next week, dude.  Is that really going to happen? 
[04:28:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I really think it is.  I love Dreyfuss.  He's a cool dude, too, man.  Really funny.  Is he really?  Yeah, he's great, right?  Yeah, he's a really good guy.  Do you ever see Whose Life Is It Anyway?  He plays a quadriplegic.  Nobody has seen that movie.  He plays a guy paralyzed from the neck down who wants his right to die in a hospital.  It's fucking great, man.  Shut up.  All right.  You're right.  Anthony just wants to go home.  But no, I want to talk about it, Ant.  We did five hours and 35 minutes of radio time.  And it won't be enough, will it?  And 20 minutes of quality programming.  It's all shit jokes.  I appreciate it.  All right, Freddy.  Thanks, Freddy, for coming in, man. 
[04:29:00]  Thank you.  Freddy doesn't know when to leave.  He's like, do I stay with this nonsense or do I?  Geez, every other show I'm on, it's very obvious when I'm done.  Just dribble.  Thanks, man.  Good luck, buddy.  I guess on this show, you just leave when you want to.  Yeah, you go.  He was a cool.  I knew he'd be cool, though.  He was a cool dude.  Yeah, what do you guys want to do?  I want to go home.  Well, I want to talk.  Do you have a bit you can play?  I'm lonely.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  All right, Derek's going to set up a bit after the break something. 
[04:29:30]  Hopefully, that hasn't been played a million times.  We still got to figure out this whole deal.  Set it up, because I can't shit anymore quite right now.  I carried this show with my bowels.  ONA Party Rock on PalTalk.  You're going to get bounced.  I'm just going to fucking bounce you.  Why?  Do not bitch about me being tired and being a baby about wanting to go home.  I'm not a baby.  That's right.  The millionaire is tuckered out.  Am I right or wrong?  Right.  They're telling us we got to go.  Yeah, they're saying we got to let you go. 
[04:30:00]  They're saying we have to go.  And we may have a big announcement soon.  Yeah, I hope so.  I'm just repeating what you said.  I have no idea what it is.  Yeah.  No one tells you anything.  I never have this skinny.  Yeah, we might be pulling off.  I want this skinny.  I have to take in all that shits today.  All that shits.  It's just late.  Tired sultz.  Nothing.  I'm going to have some electrolytes.  Anthony never messes up.  Ah, please.  Now they're going to complain.  They're going to be a little lazy they got in the last 40 minutes.  Hey, Ben.  Ben, you laugh enough today? 
[04:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Good laugh so I'm on the show.  Yeah.  You're sweating really bad today.  You all right?  I'm running around with Steve.  Yeah.  Why?  What's up with Steve?  Oh, nothing.  Is he all right?  Yeah, he's fine.  We don't see Steve that much anymore.  No.  Where is he?  I don't know.  He's...  You got to stop grabbing people.  Bobby, it's not funny anymore.  No, you're going to get somebody sued.  Stop fucking doing it.  We're going to get a lawsuit.  My person don't care.  The bit was cute, and we'll reference it every once in a while, but just stop doing it. 
[04:31:00]  Please.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't have to work so hard at it.  Because then they'll boot you.  They'll say you got to go because of a lawsuit.  You don't want that, man.  We don't want to say goodbye to you, so stick around.  That'd be a little rough on your resume.  Me and you all, Chuck.  You got fired for playing no homo.  I mean, it's going to be really tough when you try to get another job.  No, it won't.  And they call us for references.  Well, he was a good guy besides the fact that he grabbed everyone's cock.  We must have had a miscommunication.  What did you say he did?  Grabbed everyone's...  Ah, let's see. 
[04:31:30]  Huh?  No, but they wouldn't believe you said that.  They'd be like, we must have had a miscommunication.  What did you say?  All right.  Now we're all officially tired.  I'm tucking out.  All right, Jimmy.  Good luck with your ass.  Bye, pal, dog.  Give us a full report on Monday.  I have to go duty.  I hope you guys enjoyed this mess today.  And we will see you Monday.  Yes.  Yes.  We'll leave with Chuck.  All right.  Chuck?  No.  You're the last phone call of the week.  Make it good. 
[04:32:00]  Make it a showstopper.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Oh, sorry about that.  No, I'm still on pins and needles to find out what the number one heavy metal song was.  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday it was Kevin Huxford in ELO, and he stopped at number two.  I never heard.  Yeah, why don't we give him the number one heavy metal song of all time, Jimmy, if you will?  Iron Man by Black Sabbath.  Black Sabbath?  Hmm?  Is it really? 
[04:32:30]  I hate you.  Why?  You weren't supposed to give it.  Oh, you guys laughing their asses off.  Oh, no.  You were supposed to keep the bit going.  Well, wait a minute.  I misunderstood you.  Who screwed up?  You gave him too much time.  No, when he put his hand up like that, I thought he was cueing them with the music.  That's your music cue.  I was going to – I had my hand up because I thought you were going to say something silly  and then you were listening to the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That was a miscommunication because that's the bit normally, but your hand was up and 
[04:33:00]  didn't – his hand did pause a little bit like it was the music cue.  It was too long.  There was too long a gap.  Why would we give out the song?  Because you might have closed it like that.  No, and never.  I'm tired.  Never give the listeners what they want.  Never.  Was that actually it?  I just guessed.  Yes, it was it.  Oh.  I love Black Sabbath.  I love all three of y'all guys.  Shut up.  All right.  Congratulations.  Oh, thank you.  God.  That's why I looked at you for a second before I said it.  These guys went nuts in the booth.  But when you said, Jimmy, let's have it, I did look at you for a second before I said 
[04:33:30]  it because your hand was up.  My hand was up to Q Dirk.  I thought you were going to do something stupid.  Maybe a – well, you can't fart today.  See, I thought you wanted me to start saying something and then you were going to smash  him.  But then when you paused, I'm like, he wants me to give the song.  I thought you would have said like the number one heavy metal song of all time is and then  you would have done, you know, a mic check noise or something.  Then we would have blasted out of here.  I thought you said I'm all right, Spider.  It was just –  Anthony, where are you going?  I'm just getting the fuck out.  But no, no, I didn't want to kill the bit.  I don't like to wreck it.  It was just a misunderstanding.  I am just getting out of here. 
[04:34:00]  What?  Bye.  Bye, Ant.  Bye, Ant.  But no, if I would – I didn't mean to mess things up.  There we go.  I always try not to, Ant.  What?  What is that?  Can we do that again?  Well, they know.  No, now they know, Jimmy.  Now they know.  You really wrecked it.  But I didn't mean to.  You really wrecked it.  What?  You took the bit and made it the same as what you left in the toilet, a pile of steaming 
[04:34:30]  shit.  No, that would be a liquidy pool of shit because there was nothing pile-ish or steaming.  Oh?  What's whispering?  Nothing.  Oh, you're going to stay on until I leave?  Well, you know.  And then talk badly about me?  Right.  No, that's not fair.  Now I got to stay.  Look how paranoid we all are, fresh air.  Here, I don't trust anybody.  Whoever leaves the studio is going to get trapped.  Oh, my God.  I want to go home. 
[04:35:00]  I want to go home.  I want to go home.  No, no, I'm not leaving until we're off the air.  You can leave, Anthony.  You have confidence in your abilities.  No, because you all make fun of me.  No, we don't.  We're not going to make fun of you.  You'll make fun of me.  You have to trust us.  Wah, wah, penis.  Anybody.  Wah, wah, penis.  Oh, my God.  It's coming up on a quarter, too.  We're really stretching. 
[04:35:30]  Just leave, man.  It's okay.  Yeah, we won't talk about you.  But what was...  Iraq, what did he whisper to you?  What did he whisper to you?  Yeah, Iraq.  He didn't whisper anything.  He just said, just see if Anthony leaves.  Then that would be something.  He said, see if Anthony leaves.  Yeah, he figured you were going to come right back.  He knows you.  God, you're the worst actor, Iraq.  Could you believe that?  He didn't say that.  No.  Of course not.  He didn't say that.  Because he was standing.  Don't you realize, I, my friend, equal footing as far as the staff goes. 
[04:36:00]  I could have you thrown out just as quickly as he can.  He certainly could.  That's right.  And I would second it.  See?  Can we do an Iraq tender sentiment?  He really has been getting beaten up lately.  You need something to just kind of soften the blow, kid.  Okay.  No, you didn't even shake it right.  Shake it right.  No, it's...  The shake isn't enthusiastic.  Jimmy's shaking for him.  See? 
[04:36:30]  See the beauty of how Jimmy shakes it?  Oh, he just doesn't have it.  You don't have it in the wrist.  Tender sentiment.  Oh.  Now they're all telling me traffic is going to blow because I'm getting out of here late.  Oh, tender sentiment from Iraq.  Tender sentiment.  You are like a snowflake because like a snowflake, you will disappear on the ground and immediately be forgotten.  That's a good tender sentiment. 
[04:37:00]  All right.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Have a great weekend.  Thanks.  All right.  What am I?  A fucking rookie?  Do you think I'm buying...  I don't even have my headphones on.  I know what's going on.  I'm like...  Like I'm...  Okay.  Well, that was fun today, guys.  I'm a retard now. 
[04:37:30]  We thought you would run out of here.  Oh, you're off the air.  But just sit here with all the mics on.  Like I'm an idiot.  Oh, my God.  Just leave, man.  It's okay.  I can't leave while everyone is still on the air.  I do not desert the show.  I will get pounded.  You will say evil, awful things about me.  No, we won't, Ian.  We love you. 
[04:38:00]  Oh, you hate me.  You believe in yourself, don't you?  I got to pee.  Just go.  You got to beat the noon traffic.  Noon traffic to Long Island.  It's too late now.  By the time I hit the garage, it's going to be lunchtime.  Yeah.  I mean, pedestrians.  Hate them.  What are you writing?  You rock?  We're just going to a bit.  He says if we want to play his bit, I got to get out right now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Then it'll be an electrolytes.  All right.  Here we go.  It's the Opium Anthony program. 
[04:38:30]  And yeah.  Let's do it.  The Opium Anthony Show. </pre>
