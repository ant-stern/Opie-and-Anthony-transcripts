<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, weaving together listener calls, humorous banter, and promotional segments.  The show opened with a discussion about their upcoming "ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Tour" at Jones Beach, detailing ticket sales, the planned "ONA Village" and tailgating, and contrasting the officially sponsored CBS tailgate with the superior fan-organized ones.  They then launched into complaints about their inconsistent airtimes across different markets, citing Syracuse's success versus Tucson's poor performance due to scheduling issues.  This led to a running comedic feud with their program director, Tom Chiasano,  who was portrayed as prioritizing profits over creative freedom.  The hosts jokingly pitched (and rejected) various outrageous show stunts, including body painting and listener branding.

The segment included several listener calls, ranging from supportive to dismissive, punctuated by discussions on unrelated matters: a lightning strike victim (with Kenny adding a morbid joke), a Tucson crystal meth epidemic, a moose sighting, and a "Fun Fact Thursday" about 50 Cent's Vitamin Water fortune. A significant portion of the discussion revolved around a purported "gay bomb," a supposedly real but ultimately rejected Pentagon project aimed at inducing homosexuality in enemy soldiers.  They also discussed a video of an obese, naked male character from Second Life, a celebrity encounter involving Jimmy Norton and Steven Tobolowski, a humorous anecdote about an interview with Dennis Quaid, and speculation about Vince McMahon's health.

The show continued with a segment focused on co-host Eric ("Iraq") and his MySpace "Heroes" list, which included his father and Opie.  This led to an uncomfortable but ultimately revealing conversation about Eric's relationship with his father and his expectations versus the reality of working with Opie and Anthony.  The hosts admitted to hiring Eric partly because of his fandom, implying easier management.  The segment also included a recounting of an incident where Opie and Anthony left Eric stranded after a Rolling Stones concert.  The "gay bomb" discussion reappeared, interwoven with listener calls and jokes, before concluding with the confirmation that the project was scrapped.  The Jones Beach show was promoted again, offering tickets and meet-and-greets to callers.  A Stephen Lynch song was played, and the segment ended with reflections on Father's Day, including personal anecdotes about their deceased fathers.

The broadcast then transitioned to a news story about a man exposing himself in convenience stores while wearing only a diaper.  This was followed by a caller, Brock from Pittsburgh, who identified himself as a "horrible father."  A contest offering a trip to the Bunny Ranch was subsequently announced. The main focus shifted to a fabricated news story detailing the death of Vince McMahon in a fiery limo explosion, complete with a conspiratorial, overly-detailed account of a seemingly inept investigation by co-host Sam, including suspicions about the FBI's involvement and an unusually large press conference. A WWE press release was read, offering condolences. This segment ended with Fatherâ€™s Day calls; one caller recounted a tragic story about her father's family being killed in a car accident prompting a discussion about tone and listener expectations, while others shared anecdotes about their fathers' infidelity and unusual adoptions.  The hosts also briefly mentioned their dislike for an unnamed guest from another show, before concluding with promotional announcements for upcoming live shows.

[00:00:00]  Satsang with Mooji 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  This is where entertainment is going.  I'm starting to suspect my parents are swingers.  I think your dad's just a watcher.  He just sits in the corner nude.  And also, it's a horrific thing for having to mom be a sick freak.  Don't you ever do that.  I understand the concept of the syllable.  I understand the concept of the syllable.  You don't have to beat it into me with your belt.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  You are listening to our dramatic music. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  That means something very important is going to happen on today's show.  How's it?  Not really.  Just the same old crap.  Hi.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning, little Jimmy Norton.  Howdy.  Good morning. 
[00:04:30]  Getting ready for Saturday, Jones Beach?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very ready for it.  That's this Saturday already.  Wow.  Ticket sales are really, really, really good the last few days.  So we're going to have a nice crowd out there at Jones Beach for the ONA Traveling Virus  Comedy Tour.  Nine comedians.  The ONA Village.  The tailgating.  Yes.  Can't wait.  Take us through Ticketmaster.com.  Go to VirusTour.  One word on MySpace for all the info.  And as the tour goes on, we're going to be adding stuff to VirusTour. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  Maybe some of the videos we're making at the venues and updates and I guess some of the  articles we're doing.  We're getting interviewed about the tour.  The latest articles are up there.  I like how the interview about the tour goes in other directions.  What do you mean?  Well, we sit down to interview with various newspapers and stuff and they ask us questions  about the tour.  And then the questions go to other places.  And Kenny has to step in.  Now, now. 
[00:05:30]  Kenny was in a panic.  Yeah.  Hey.  Like, Kenny.  Relax.  You agreed.  We'll field this.  Kenny, don't worry about it.  We can handle ourselves.  We can field that question.  Yeah.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hello, Syracuse.  Syracuse.  So weird, man.  We're syndicated across America.  You just get these pockets where people like to show more than other areas.  And Syracuse is one of those areas. 
[00:06:00]  They're just digging the Opie and Anthony show.  How was Brother Weiss on?  Nah, he's in Rochester.  Oh, yeah.  Pete was right.  I thought he was on in Syracuse.  We're doing very well in Rochester, but we've got a weird time in Rochester.  It's like just before afternoon drive, which I've been arguing about.  I think we need to be like, you know, starting at like four or five, but they know what they're  doing.  I hate that whole thing with like this stupid time zone thing.  Yeah.  Because you're here, you know, we're based, our flagship station here in New York. 
[00:06:30]  And, you know, out west, it's three hours earlier.  Yeah.  So we start at an ungodly hour if we want to be live out west.  Yeah.  So it's not really the morning drive slot.  No.  No, if we want to be live out west, we would start at nine.  We'd start at nine, that'd be six out west.  Yeah, but then we would miss drive here.  Yeah, yeah.  Drive time on the East Coast.  See, so it doesn't work out.  Rochester's in this time zone.  Yes, it is.  That's in our time zone. 
[00:07:00]  Well, that's good.  We're from Rochester.  We have to go to the time zone.  I know.  I was like, where's he going?  I was saying these little, you were saying, I could justify this.  All right.  You were saying that there's certain little pockets that dig the show.  Yeah.  And others that not so much.  And I was kind of trying to allude to the fact that some of the markets that don't like  us so much aren't hearing us during morning drive.  We're on at three in the morning.  Well, yeah.  Well, Syracuse is loving us.  Got some latest info. 
[00:07:30]  Are they in our time zone, Jim?  Yeah, they have them.  They're an hour later.  The latest info.  Syracuse loves us.  What you're getting at, Tucson hates us.  Yeah, see?  We're a very honest radio show, by the way.  Other talk show hosts will make believe they're great in every city.  Howard used to make believe he was great in every city.  The fact is, he sucked in a lot of cities.  It just happens.  He was really good in more cities than he sucked.  Yes.  So, you know, the same thing is happening with us.  Syracuse loves the radio show.  Tucson buried the radio show. 
[00:08:00]  Why does that happen?  We were on, what, six to nine in Tucson?  So it was on a three-hour time delay.  Time delay, yeah.  And now they spin it to, like, good news, guys, we're putting you on live.  All right.  And then you do the math and realize live means they're hearing us at three in the morning in Tucson.  Good news.  So we're the John and Jeffs of Tucson?  Yeah.  So I want to say hi to everybody in Tucson that stumbled on our show because they're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night.  You're just drunk somewhere.  Yeah, great. 
[00:08:30]  Taking a whiz.  Whatever you got to do that gets you up to listen to us.  These radio execs suck.  They try to spin everything.  Hey, very good news.  We're going to put you on live here in Tucson.  No.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  What, are we going to be working from a time machine?  And then you do the math.  You go, how is that good news to be on at three in the morning?  It ain't.  Three in the morning, man.  Three in the morning is reserved for some, like, intern.  Yeah.  And they pay him, like, five bucks an hour and they go, hey, you know, just play the songs. 
[00:09:00]  But, all right, do a weather forecast once an hour.  That'll be okay.  We'll let you open your mouth for that.  Don't try to be funny.  Don't do any material.  You can read a PSA every 40 minutes.  Yeah.  You can read a PSA and you can do a weather break every hour.  That's okay.  When he goes home, did you hear me on the radio today, Mom?  Right.  Cute.  So, that's our good news for Tucson.  We're on in the middle of the night.  Thank you.  Thanks a lot for that.  We greatly appreciate it.  Let's say hi to Chris in Monroe. 
[00:09:30]  By the way, that was Fan's shift at his last station before he came on board here.  Hey, we all, I did all those shit.  Hey, we all paid our dues.  No.  No, you didn't.  I paid my dues in work.  I'm bitter to this day that you didn't pay your dues.  I was working very hard.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey there, Chris.  I've got to be honest, not a huge listener.  I am now, but I just started listening to you guys not too long ago, but I am going 
[00:10:00]  to be there on Saturday.  Okay.  Definitely loving the show, man.  Okay.  Definitely loving the show.  I've been listening to it for about a year.  Well, I've got to be honest with you, not loving this phone call, though.  So, you know.  It's cool we just started listening to your phone call.  Yeah, I've got to be honest, I'm not a big fan of your phone call, Chris.  I'm not a huge fan of your phone call, but, you know, I've just started listening to  it, but I'm kind of digging it a little bit.  I'll give you a chance, though.  Yeah.  I don't know, guys. 
[00:10:30]  I'll give you a chance, but so far what I've heard, I'm not really digging.  I'm not that impressed, but I'll give you a try.  Oh, Chris, we'll give you a try.  What else you got?  All right.  The reason why I was calling up is Saturday.  Definitely going to be there.  Yeah.  Where's the ONA Village going to be set up?  Is it going to be set up early?  Yeah.  Or, like, where's the majority of the party?  Oh, shut up!  That's a good question, though, sir.  Go ahead.  It's a great question, but then you continue with your question. 
[00:11:00]  I hate people that continue with their question.  They ask the question, but then they continue with the question.  Okay.  ONA Village will be very close to the venue.  I'm not sure exactly where.  Right outside the venue.  And that opens up.  If Kenny was in here, he could tell me.  But, what, the show starts at 8, Jimmy?  Yes.  So I guess the Village would be something like 6 to 8,  and then the tailgating will happen before that.  I mean, the faithful listeners will be out at Jones Beach  probably by 2 or 3 in the afternoon.  Kenny, Randy.  So to Kenny, go.  Good morning. 
[00:11:30]  The schedule so far, CBS is starting their tailgate party 3 o'clock.  Wow.  CBS is having an official tailgate party?  Yeah, there's, like, a big, a big tailgate party by CBS.  Was there too much fun when the listeners did it on their own?  There's no girls.  That CBS has to go in and maybe rip out some of that fun that was in it?  No girls, no booze.  Looks like a bunch of men drinking Hawaiian Punch.  Having sales discussions.  Yeah, let me...  Pies are mandatory.  You can buy your pink ties, and they're going to be a booth selling fake braces 
[00:12:00]  so you can look like Tom Chiasano.  Yeah, let me tell you what happened.  I mean, obviously, these guys are alluding to it.  Tom figured out how to sponsor our tailgate party.  It used to be just a thing that the fans did,  and they just kind of made it up as they went along.  All of a sudden, you're like, oh, a beer pong table.  That's cool.  And then another guy is, like, cranking out the radio show  or his favorite opening, Anthony Bits.  Then there's a little barbecue over here.  But no, Tom has now decided he needs to take the fun out of the tailgating. 
[00:12:30]  He's going to hand out...  And make it an official wink, wink, nudge, nudge,  meaning I'm getting a lot of money in my back pocket tailgate party.  He's going to hand out, wow, vomit bags.  Today's blackout was sponsored by...  Who is sponsoring the O&A tailgating party?  I'm just guessing.  I think it's, like, Toyota Tundra, and they got hot wings,  and they got all kinds of, like...  Oh, great.  Do they have wings?  Yeah.  You know, when you step back from our position  and just look at the big picture, 
[00:13:00]  Tom is an amazing man.  The guy can just about sell anything.  But see, it's not about fun with him,  and that's the problem I have with him.  Well, fun and sales really got hand in hand.  Hey, no, you got to keep the fun in radio.  Yeah.  I don't really see that with Tom.  I see, I see, let's...  Oh, shut up, Chris!  Oh, Chris is trying to get his line in.  Chris, you know how people have to, like,  change to a different radio show?  I got changed to a different caller.  Goodbye.  You're just turning him off. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  But anyway, 3 o'clock, CBS tailgating.  The Village starts 5.30.  Oh, 5.30, okay.  All right, and then the comedy show,  extravaganza, we'll start at 7.  And then, I'm not sure,  because it depends on each venue,  then after the show,  we usually hang out and do some stuff, too.  Yeah, well, we do our infamous autograph signing.  Yes.  When we sell a lot of merchandise, people,  subliminal hint.  I was going to say, you beat me to the punch.  That's subliminal.  Also called the buy something from Jimmy Norton. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  You know, after our party.  He has subliminal, like,  Kenny works for the movie companies.  He subliminally does, like, ads.  Like, in the middle of the movie,  you just see his figure walking across with a coat going,  yummy.  This beverage is delicious.  Yeah.  All right.  You excited, Kenny?  The big day finally here.  Two days away.  I'm beyond excited.  And you brought up the body painting yesterday.  I'm working on that.  Oh, nice.  I know I put you in a panic,  because I came back,  because I forgot something in the office,  and all I hear is Kenny talking to the guys, 
[00:14:30]  and now they want body painting.  I don't, I, I, I'm overwhelmed here, people.  Body painting.  And that's going to cost money,  and I got, I got to find that last minute.  Yeah, but the thing that's going to set you off  is there's no nudity at Jones Beach,  because it's a state park.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the body painting.  But it's not real nudity.  Yeah, we, we,  in, in the Opie and Anthony world,  we learned a long time ago,  if you have a millimeter of paint on your body,  you're not nude.  Yeah, it's like a, 
[00:15:00]  Look it up.  It's not just regular spray paint stuff.  It's like this latex stuff  that is kind of thick.  Right.  And it works almost as a brassiere.  Yeah.  It's a spray-on brassiere.  Yeah.  Right, but we're lucky  if we can afford watercolor with our budget.  I know.  We'll just get some listeners  with, yeah, watercolors.  Yeah, our budget isn't too impressive,  but it's still a fine show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, we feel good.  All right, so the tickets are still available  through Ticketmaster.  You go to VirusTour,  one word on MySpace, 
[00:15:30]  to get all the updates on the tour.  Because the other cities are sitting there like,  Will you shut up?  We're nowhere near Jones Beach,  but we're coming close to you guys as well.  Yeah, why you.  So go to VirusTour for all the updates,  one word.  And tomorrow after the show,  if you could find us,  we're going to have 100 tickets  to give away to Jones Beach for Saturday.  It's after this show.  Yeah, after this show,  if you could find us.  There's a deli next door  I'm going to afterwards,  and I'm going to bring all my friends  from the radio show to the deli.  That's a door or two down from here.  So you want to maybe see us wherever you can. 
[00:16:00]  But that's probably going to be.  We'll give away some tickets.  To a deli.  We're walking down 57th Street.  That's right.  There you go.  So if you find us,  we'll give you tickets as long as they last.  And you might want to remind listeners  to bring their sunscreen Saturday  because it's all outdoors.  What's the weather forecast for a Saturday?  You're doom and gloom all the time.  Matter of fact,  Anthony from New York,  go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Love the show.  Yeah.  Listen, I'm getting all pumped up  to go to this virus,  and we're pretty excited about it.  And then Kenny gets on the phone  or on the radio, 
[00:16:30]  and it's so depressing.  I just feel like crying.  Oh, you don't even know the half of it, Anthony.  I mean, you bring up a great point.  We were in the office earlier,  and a story comes on the news.  We got the news just playing the whole time  we were in the office before the show,  getting a little info.  And there's a story about a guy  that was mowing his lawn.  He got hit by a bolt of lightning.  Yeah.  They held up his pants.  They were shredded.  And one of his shoes,  his left shoe,  was split from the top of the shoe 
[00:17:00]  all the way down to the sole of the shoe.  It was just split open and blown out.  And he had to put bandages on his left foot.  The guy was pretty screwed up,  but he was okay.  He was alive.  And Kenny looks and goes,  I once saw a guy that got hit by lightning  and his feet blew off.  They were still in his shoes.  So, like, Kenny had to top the story  because we were looking like,  holy crap, it blew his pants off.  His pants, he held them up.  It looked like when the Incredible Hulk 
[00:17:30]  would turn into the Hulk.  Yeah.  And then he'd stop being the Hulk  and his pants were all shredded.  That's what his pants looked like.  Looks like they made his pants that way.  But they blew off him.  And it was bad enough.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Could you imagine that?  The guy I saw, his feet blew off.  Thanks, Kenny.  Thanks a lot.  Conjuring up that little image.  All right, Anthony.  We'll see you at Jones Beach or what?  I guess not.  I guess not.  Just hung up on you, O.P.  Let's go to Ryan in New Jersey.  Ryan, what's up?  What's going on, fellas? 
[00:18:00]  Hey, Ryan.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I'm listening to you guys this morning, bro,  talking about Tucson, Arizona.  And I got good news for you guys, man.  Yeah.  Out in Tucson, bro, they got what we might want to call  a crystal meth epidemic.  So 3 o'clock in the morning is perfect.  Oh, okay.  Hey, we want to say hi to all the meth heads.  Yeah, we're going to start talking a lot faster.  We're going to have a lot more energy on this show  so we can relate to those guys.  Great.  We'll do breaks on scabs and how people are watching us 
[00:18:30]  and following us.  You guys got to talk a little bit faster for them, bro.  I hear you.  We got black helicopters outside the window right now  as we think, though, so we're in good shape.  All right, Ryan.  How about we just remind people to wipe that white stuff  from the corners of their mouth every five minutes?  Yeah.  That'll help the meth people.  All right, let's go to John in Maine.  Let's go, John.  Hi, John.  What's up?  Hey, I just want to say, Tucson can bite me.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry, what are you doing?  I love when the areas start fighting with each other. 
[00:19:00]  Maine hates Tucson.  Maine's jumping on Tucson.  I like it.  I like it a lot.  What's up, John?  It's Defenders of the Faith.  K-Rock, man.  Hey, when was the last time you saw a moose?  What's that?  Oh, forget it.  I want to do a moose bit with you,  but you're not going with anything.  Why are you calling?  I am just calling to give my opinion.  Of what?  Maine and Tucson.  Tucson?  Yes.  Tucson.  I'm like Tucson.  All right.  Thank you.  By the way, since today is Fun Fact Thursday.  Wow.  Wow, Jimmy.  It's Fun Fact Thursday? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, it is.  Thursday's a day for fun facts.  I like how these days...  How come they never happen every week?  Oh, can I guess what the fun fact is?  You certainly can.  Right.  It's a fact that your parents are swingers.  You finally found out.  Yes.  No, that would be on Humiliation Monday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Yes.  Did you guys know 50 Cent?  I didn't know this had like a stock in that stupid flavored vitamin water, which I happen  to like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They sold it to Coke. 
[00:20:00]  He just made like 50...  A hundred million dollars.  Oh, it's a hundred.  Are you kidding?  50?  He made a hundred million dollars off a 4.8.  On a legitimate business venture.  Very legitimate.  Wow.  He created a grape flavor for...  What was it called?  Vitamin...  There was a name of the grape version of the vitamin water that was 50 Cent.  Yeah.  Glass, yeah, glass, whatever it was.  What's it called, E-Rock?  Yeah, E-Rock.  E-Rock, what is it?  A microphone, please.  I'm looking it up.  Oh, you don't know for sure? 
[00:20:30]  I was looking at some hot chicks.  Formula 50?  I don't know if it's...  Oh, he's got it.  Yeah.  Is it Formula 50?  Formula 50.  All right.  Yeah, because vitamin water was just sold and 50 Cent gets a hundred million dollars.  Oh, E-Rock.  A hundred million dollars.  He goes taking a swig.  All right.  He's trying to be all quiet now when he drinks his water.  Why don't you just get a saline IV drip? 
[00:21:00]  Almighty.  How thirsty are you?  Hydrate yourself.  Hey, Jones Beach, Saturday, high of 79 with isolated thunderstorms.  So we might be looking at some nice wet t-shirts.  Ah.  See?  Isolate.  Turn a negative into a positive.  If it was Kenny, he would turn it into a complete weather disaster.  I think they ought to close the venue.  This could be dangerous.  You could be held liable.  Even though it's going to rain, don't bring your umbrellas, people.  Lightning.  You could get struck by lightning.  And then your shoes will be left at the venue with your feet attached. 
[00:21:30]  If the paint runs on the girls that are body painted, we could get in big trouble.  You don't want to spend the night in jail.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news.  No, you don't.  You love it.  You don't.  If the Grim Reaper could tap dance and click his heels.  Can someone tell Eric the monitor's not on?  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  Oh, no, E-Rock.  I don't know what happens with these guys.  Every morning we have to say the exact same thing. 
[00:22:00]  I feel like I'm living Groundhog's Day.  It's the same routine.  It's amazing to me.  Every day.  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Turn on the monitor.  Where's the show prep?  Who says Ned Ryerson?  Ned?  Yeah.  That guy was in Mississippi Burning.  He played Clayton Townley, the head Klansman. 
[00:22:30]  Wow.  Yeah.  Not such a happy fella in that movie.  What did he say?  I love Mississippi.  He's like a segregationist Klansman.  Clayton Townley.  Wow.  What's his name?  I don't know his real name.  Good actor, I guess.  I told this story years ago.  One of my greatest celebrity moments ever was with that guy.  Steven Tobolowski or something like that.  A famous character actor.  He was in Memento. 
[00:23:00]  Memento.  Memento.  Yeah.  He lived on my street, Jimmy.  Really?  He was filming some kind of movie in New York, so I guess he was renting on my street because  I haven't seen him in a while now.  And all of a sudden he was there.  Every day I was seeing him for about maybe six to eight months, and then he just was gone.  He had kids.  I think it was his wife or girlfriend or something.  Oh, he's walking the streets in my neighborhood.  And one day, I'm with Jay, a friend of Aunt and I's, and I said, I have to do it.  So he's passing me, and I did the whole.  Oh, no, you didn't. 
[00:23:30]  Ned?  Ned Ryerson?  Did he just look at you disgusted?  Absolutely.  Like, oh, God.  Do you think I don't hear that all the time?  I was thinking I was being clever, and then you realize, no.  I sure as heckfire know you.  Right.  Oh, shut up.  He rolled his eyes and just kind of acknowledged that someone was talking to him, and then proceeded  on his way.  But just as obnoxious as I could, I'm like, Ned?  Ned Ryerson? 
[00:24:00]  That is great to just, like, blurt crap like that out and watch celebrities just go, oh,  all right.  Because you think you're the one that came up with the clever thing to say to him?  Yeah, you're not.  No, they've heard it all.  Well, I'm such a hack.  I met Pesci outside of, or my mother used to call him Joe Pesky.  Joe Pesky?  Yeah, and I met him outside of Joe Pesky.  Did she ever hook up, her and dad?  I'm sure.  Pesky and his girl.  I'm sure they did.  No, they might be that.  Bermuda.  Her, you know, Pesci and De Niro have turns with her in 1980.  Oh, God.  Scorsese's trailer.  No. 
[00:24:30]  It was, Pesci was outside of the comedy cellar, so I went over for a photo, and I was so starstruck.  I swear to God, all I said to him was, I loved you in Goodfellas.  I loved you in Goodfellas.  And he's probably like, who didn't?  But it was like, who didn't?  Could I have been a bigger hack in real life?  I loved you in Goodfellas.  What you've got to do is you've got to IMDb, and you can do it right from your BlackBerry  or whatever you're carrying around these days, and just find that one movie that was just  a god-awful bomb and say you loved him in that.  Yeah, like, we did that to Dennis Quaid. 
[00:25:00]  How much fun did we have with Dennis Quaid?  All the movies Dennis Quaid made, and I spent the entire interview doing a Mickey Rooney impression  from the movie Bill.  Yeah.  It was like one of his first roles.  It was a TV movie where Bill, Mickey Rooney, plays a retarded gentleman.  He was institutionalized his whole life, and this filmmaker, Dennis Quaid, decides he's going  to do a documentary on him, and finds out after time that, you know, Bill is a real nice guy 
[00:25:30]  and sweet guy and kind of builds a relationship up with him as a friend, and that's the whole  story, but Bill is hysterical.  It is a comedy.  You watch this and just laugh at Mickey Rooney's interpretation of what a retarded gentleman  is supposed to be like.  It's so hard to get that movie.  It's so over the top.  I know.  And when it came out originally, I don't think it got any type of buzz.  How many stars did that movie get?  Go to Rotten Tomatoes.  It was reviews on that.  It was just awful, and don't look at Bill on his own.  That's the sequel, and it doesn't even compare. 
[00:26:00]  No, no.  It was Bill, it was Dennis Quaid, and Mickey Rooney, and we get Dennis Quaid on the phone,  and I just start going, my buddy, Barry's my buddy, and he probably hadn't heard anyone  ever reference that movie, because he started cracking up going, you've got to be kidding  me.  He loved it, but then what's great about our show, I have to pat ourselves on the back  today.  We just continue.  You didn't stop.  It gets to a point where, all right, move on. 
[00:26:30]  Let's talk about something else I did, and we refused.  It was all about Bill.  It was just about the one movie he did that no one knows about.  Bill, it's Barry.  Hey, I'm calling my friend, Barry.  Okay, what's his number?  359-625-384-395-720.  He couldn't even, he didn't know how many numbers were in a phone number. 
[00:27:00]  Bill was a dope.  He was a complete dope.  Yeah.  And then he starts running after some old lady.  It's my sister.  That's my sister from Florida Street.  And he's running after her, and she goes, no, stop.  My name's Ida.  And she's running away from this retarded guy.  Zell.  Yeah, Zell.  That's Sarah, my sister, Sarah.  And she's like, no.  And they had wacky cam, like the camera was shaking, and she's running away looking into  the camera lens going, I'm Ida. 
[00:27:30]  That was classic.  By the way, we've got to take a break, but real fast.  Matt, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Make it fast.  We're in a speed round right now.  What's up?  Oh, yeah, sorry.  I hope I'm a looper.  My boss called me Danny Boy.  Looper project.  Hey, a little fun fact about myself.  I don't know if I looped for at least 10 to 12 years.  That's awesome.  This is my 10th season.  Yeah, I'm still freaking a jock. 
[00:28:00]  But, hey, Jim, you're the best.  But your fun fact should be a fun fact fossil.  That Formula 50 drink, that stupid drink I've been drinking for two years.  So thanks for the fun fact there, pal.  You know why I read it today, sir?  It was in the post on page six, so it came to my attention.  I don't claim to be the inventor of fun facts.  I only bring them when I feel the fun potential.  And why does a fun fact have to be something that's topical or timely?  A fun fact can be old. 
[00:28:30]  I could bring up a few fun facts from, let's say, the late 30s to the mid-40s.  But I choose not to.  I'll stick to the current ones.  It's a current fun fact because, you know, the deal that he made just happened less than a week ago.  He made $100.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bert from Philly, fun fact, Don Herbert, the late Mr. Wizard, was a decorated World War II B-2 bomber pilot.  Are you kidding me?  We're doing fun facts all day long now.  Now that's a fun fact that I could have brought up. 
[00:29:00]  Jimmy started.  It's fun fact Thursday.  Was Bill released on DVD last month?  And if it's Bill on his own, I will do things to you.  All right.  Listen, one more before the break.  We started talking about Tucson.  We end this break talking about Tucson.  Mike in Tucson.  What's up?  Hey, brother.  I'm sorry about the idiot earlier.  That's all right.  What do you got?  Nothing, man.  I just wanted to tell you guys great job. 
[00:29:30]  I listen to you every day.  You guys keep it rolling, man.  Keep me awake.  I run a pump truck in the middle of the night.  Pump truck?  Great.  That's who we're talking to.  What are you pumping?  Concrete.  We're talking to guys that decide not to finish high school, so they've got to get jobs in  the middle of the night.  Thanks, Tucson.  I'm certain he makes a nice dime.  I'm just messing with you.  I'm sure he does fine with that pump truck.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  That's all right.  No problem, bro.  All right.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Jimmy's doing the fun facts, and Kenny gives us gloomy facts every day. 
[00:30:00]  So there you go.  The gloom facts.  No, Ken's idea of fun facts just aren't fun.  No.  There's nothing fun about Kenny.  No, not at all.  All right.  We break.  When we get back, we've got to give you the update on Vince McMahon.  Sam's all over this story.  We've got the latest on that, his death.  And we definitely got to talk about the gay bomb in a few minutes.  What?  The government was working on a gay bomb.  Stop.  I swear to God.  How come I consider myself very well-read as far as the news goes? 
[00:30:30]  I check all the sites.  I have not heard about the gay bomb.  This isn't some wacky radio bit.  They actually were working on this.  They believe they had the formula to make a gay bomb.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Let me imagine what the ingredients are.  Where it gets aimed at.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I've got to tell you, the family, a couple of my brothers called me and emailed me last night. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Couldn't get enough of that video that we turned everyone on to yesterday from Second Life.  Oh, yeah.  Free hugs.  Got with his free hugs sign.  I think if you throw free hugs Second Life into YouTube, you get to check out this fine,  fine video of this just naked, outer-shaped, beer-belly dude with an awful, like, monster  face, kind of.  Yeah.  Like, what was the reference you used yesterday, Jimmy?  He looked like Bob Kelly. 
[00:31:30]  Well, that.  True.  And I forget his name.  He looked like Tor Johnson.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And then he's got a big oversized unit that he's just kind of swinging around.  It's a virtual game online called Second Life.  And you make up a character, you animate him, you know, you get to pick his physical attributes,  and then you walk around and live this second life.  That's what it's called, Second Life. 
[00:32:00]  And a lot of people like just really living a life there.  They go to the beach.  They meet with people.  They go to clubs.  They do this all in a virtual world.  And then there's some people that just have to be complete asses, make the characters' physical  attributes completely obese, make a hideous-looking face, and then put on giant, giant privates  and go around and just wave it around.  Yeah.  Let me ask you.  It's stunning.  It is hilarious to look at. 
[00:32:30]  On regular radio, I mean, this should not be, are we allowed to say that they had animated  a giant penis on a character?  Um, I don't, no, you could say that, but then we might have a problem saying what he was doing  with it.  Oh, okay.  Right, right, right.  Yeah.  Just go check out the video.  It's going to be on our website.  Yeah.  Within the next hour or so.  It's weird.  Rules.  Stupid rules.  Rules.  Our phone number is.  Tom came in and challenged and said that he is a fun guy, and I'm convinced.  Yeah, sold me.  He's a fun guy.  Uh, 877-212-5762. 
[00:33:00]  He's already mad at me this morning.  Why?  Let's leave it at that.  So I told him to leave, and he said, I'll leave when I'm ready.  Oh, I missed that one.  And then he goes, I'm ready now.  It's his.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's his, uh, ship.  This is his command.  It is.  He was kind of annoying me, so I'm like, go.  And he goes, I'll go when I want.  And he goes, and I'm ready to go.  And now he's ready to go.  How much longer did he wait before he said, I'm ready to go now?  About three seconds. 
[00:33:30]  But he was, he left on his terms.  Look, we get scared when we see ties in general.  I mean, you know, Tom's been, uh, he's been good to us for the last year.  He's the skipper.  Here's how I see it, too.  I, I, I'll be honest.  I think our relationship with Tom is, uh, way better than I ever thought it would be.  Yeah.  Tom's a guy who made it through, like, he's one of those guys that made it through a bunch  of wars.  You know what I mean?  He made it through a bunch of wars.  And then he's not going to have a reckless platoon take him out in his last tour and get shot 
[00:34:00]  in the head.  That's, that's Tom's position.  That's exactly what his position is.  He does not like, he's, he's seen our past record of fragging our lieutenants.  Oh, yeah.  We, we have fragged many a superior officer during our career and Tom ain't going to be  that guy.  So whether it's him being overly cautious on certain things, we have to sell him harder 
[00:34:30]  on things that we want to do for him to, you know, really, uh, investigate whether it  can be done, whether it's feasible or not.  Uh, that's, that's the mindset he's in because he's been through the, the mill, uh, with Howard  over the years and he knows how to, to work it, but he doesn't want us to do what happened  to, you know, Ken Stevens and Jeremy and the multitude of other people that we've left  in our, our wake of death and destruction as we just skip through life with our shoelaces 
[00:35:00]  untied.  Yeah.  That's his side of the whole thing, which I, which I definitely see.  I would love to, to be able to do anything we want in here, but it just ain't going to  happen.  It ain't going to happen.  Well, I, I basically said that he says no to everything and he goes, well, did I, uh,  get you that father's day thing at the party ranch?  I go, uh, yeah, well, there you go.  I'm like, yeah, but you said no to it.  So many things that I can't even list anymore.  Steve has a notebook and I'm like, well, Steve, go for the notebook. 
[00:35:30]  What have all these things?  Right.  He's got a day in the notebook like an old cancer eyebrow.  Let me open, let me open up my notebook.  Ooh, his buttocks was firm and tight as I walked behind him down the side.  Oh wait, these are my personal notes.  And then there's a negotiation that goes on.  Cause he goes, I said hi to the, uh, I said, uh, yes to the, uh, torn feather bed.  Yeah.  And I'm like, but you said no, because the girls have to be in bikinis.  That's not a yes.  We want, we want nude women to come in.  Yeah.  Get, get, yeah, they're, they're naked. 
[00:36:00]  We want to rub them with honey.  And then we want to get, uh, industrial fans and just blow money all over them.  And whatever money sticks, they get to keep.  Cause I said yes to them.  Like you said yes to that with bikinis and that it's just not as effective.  Of course it's not.  It's awful.  Like he doesn't understand that.  I, you know, he doesn't understand that part of the, uh, a radio show.  Like that is not as, as exciting to listen to then if the girls were nude.  But now he's like, but I said, hi, uh, I said, I keep saying hi.  I said yes to, to pasties. 
[00:36:30]  Well, let, let me play the GM's advocate here.  All right.  Uh, he, he's just thinking.  Are you sucking up to the boss?  Yes.  Why?  He, I don't know.  We got two jobs.  It seems to be the good thing to do.  We got two jobs.  It's a good cop, bad cop.  Shut up.  Oh.  Uh, I, I think what he's thinking is he, I'm sure even Tom personally thinks that nudity would  be better, uh, for the air and, and, uh, it would make it more exciting personally, 
[00:37:00]  but professionally, he can't make that decision to, to say, you know, that, that the girls  can be naked.  That's not his.  Oh, here he comes.  We're having a good show.  You're going to take all the fun out of it.  I don't know.  Tom may have some fun things.  I have faith in Tom.  Oh boy.  Here we go.  I just, I think Anthony is not, I don't think it's so much Anthony sucking up to you.  I'm wanting to be, I'm, I'm playing the GM's advocate as I like to go.  It's GM's advocate Thursday today.  Thank you so much.  And I'm trying to put it in perspective that it really, it probably, you personally would 
[00:37:30]  probably love to see a nude girl here getting honey, uh, put on her and money blown on her.  What fun would that be?  What fun would that be?  Geez, maybe he's right about your ties, Tom.  Every time I have ties to say yes, the tie whispers no.  He's got Paul Lind hanging around his neck.  What guy wouldn't like to see you?  Of course.  Oh, there you go.  Of course.  But there are certain things in place.  See, he didn't really answer the question. 
[00:38:00]  He answers it by saying that.  Right.  There are things in place.  There are, uh, you know, I guess the person that made that first steam engine got blown  to bits when it exploded.  Then they realized to put in certain safety valves.  Called gaskets and things like that.  Yes.  And things that blow off that extra steam pressure.  And you go, oh boy, we would have been blown up if that wasn't there.  That's Tom.  Tom is a valve.  Wow.  That's pretty impressive. 
[00:38:30]  Especially when...  I'm sure he's loving that.  ...to keep throwing coal, even though the pressure gauge says, stop, all right, all right.  You'll die.  Who's the guy tightening down the bolts as the pressure gauge goes into the red?  It's damn funny.  The coal thrower and Anthony show.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  You know.  All right.  Well...  Go back to having fun.  All right.  I just...  I mean, I can only imagine what it's like dodging so many bullets over the years and then, 
[00:39:00]  you know, having to deal with people that have probably gotten some of their superior officers  killed.  Just a few.  There's a memorial wall based on our show.  All right.  All right.  People...  I think family members go to it and do little rubbings of their names.  Oh, Ken Stevens.  All the careers.  Oh, Ken.  Is there a name for Radio Tourette's?  Radio Tourette's?  No.  Radio Tourette's.  Why?  Because I...  Well, because I... 
[00:39:30]  I think I'm blurting out ideas before we thought them out, is it?  Oh, is that what you think?  No, Kiles!  No, that's...  That's...  That's kind of...  Rally!  Oh, sorry.  No, right, right, right.  That helps the listening experience, though.  We like to bring some of our creative meetings onto the air.  I like the spontaneity of a lot of things where you come up with something and go, wow,  that would be really cool, and then you just dive into it headfirst.  Spontaneity is good, absolutely.  I like that.  As long as it's well-honed and sponsored. 
[00:40:00]  As long as it's well-thought-out, spontaneity is great.  He calls it spontaneity.  It is spontaneity.  Today's spontaneity moment was sponsored by...  He's still, at the end of the day, a B.I. business.  A B.I. business.  B.I. business.  That's right.  More business than fun, though, Tom.  That's right.  We're going for fun.  You're going for business.  No, no.  This is a fun business.  It's a teeter.  I think I see it as a teeter-totter. 
[00:40:30]  We're each sitting on the end of business and fun, and someday, when Tom's way up on  top, we're going to jump off and let him hurt his tailbone, like we did in the playground.  When Tom was way at the bottom, then you're going to jump off, and Tom would jump to the  top, wouldn't you?  No.  Gravity doesn't work.  We'll explain gravity.  You're right.  You're right.  No, no.  Sorry.  Sorry.  We're taking gravity.  Go Google teeter-totter.  Or I'll be at the bottom, and someone will throw a lead weight idea, and then I'll spring  to the top.  Why couldn't we do the branding bit? 
[00:41:00]  See, now I'm getting fun facts.  Oh, is Steve coming in finally?  They could sign enough stuff so we could do a branding bit.  Someone wanted to come in and be branded.  The word hate across his chest.  Even sacrifice should be next in the studio.  We actually used to think about that on AEW.  People get branded all the time.  For fraternities and stuff.  It doesn't adhere.  It's like a new form of piercing and tattooing and things like that is the branding.  I see.  You see guys in football all the time with those horseshoes on their arms.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's random.  But that's a no-go? 
[00:41:30]  That's a no-go.  Is there a reason?  I just don't know.  Yeah.  We're not willing to take the risk.  Just like we don't let tattoos happen here.  There's a health risk.  Yeah.  And the health risk is too high.  So if they've got some kind of infection or something, they could then say...  Let's say you put the brand on the guy, and a guy has a heart attack because  of the searing pain that they don't have.  You get a big laugh out of him.  Ratings.  Ratings.  Ratings.  Right.  He signed his life away.  Exactly.  Ratings.  Ratings.  Ratings.  Ratings.  I have a great idea.  No, let's not go there.  But that's like saying...  That's probably a risk.  But if you have... 
[00:42:00]  Say you sponsor something where you swim for charity, you do...  Isn't there always a risk that someone can have a heart attack?  Like, is that stuff not sign-offable?  Because a heart attack can happen when you're doing anything.  Like, if you're having a jumping jacks contest or whatever, they have to sign away a health  thing.  Supervising the Opie and Anthony show.  I had to go for a physical to prove that I was okay.  Like, they cover themselves, so if I have a heart attack on stage...  Right.  My manager can't sue them, my family can't sue them, and say they stressed me out too  much, I had a heart attack on the stage.  They can have a heart attack when we give away tickets to our show.  Exactly.  Because of excitement.  Because they see the awful seat thing. 
[00:42:30]  There's risk, and then there's elevated risk.  But is that not sign-offable?  Like, if someone says, like, I'm sober and I'm aware of the risk, and they go for a physical  maybe first, with a doctor that CBS says is acceptable, is there not a way to do that?  Listen, there's releases that can be written for anything, and anybody can say, you know  what, I really didn't understand what I signed when I signed the release and sue you anyway.  True.  But then there's also, let's say we wanted to do a show where you plug into the wall and 
[00:43:00]  hit the person with a couple hundred volts, and they drop dead.  And whether he signed a release or not, I believe that is a negligence.  Yeah.  I don't know.  The water people got off.  Yeah, well, I think that was because she did seem kind of fine.  They still have to answer to God, but they got off.  They'll be judged later.  Right.  In the afterlife.  We should...  The water drinking people.  Can we do a water drinking thing here?  Of course not.  Are you...  If it's fun.  If it's fun. 
[00:43:30]  How about if we get it sponsored by 50 St. Vitamin Water?  Tom, see, look, we've got to take a break, see?  I'm leaving.  Oh, darn.  We want to talk to you for another ten minutes, but we want to make sure we break on time.  Sure.  Thank you, Mr. Chiasano.  Always a pleasure.  And it's kissing your ass.  I'm just trying to put it in perspective.  You've changed, man.  I have not got a mortgage, and I just bought a new car.  Leave me alone.  Yeah, you really...  The more...  Whenever he's nice to someone, I'm like, well, he just picked up a new payment for something. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, I know.  That wasn't about Tom.  That was about, ah, the Escalade came in.  Yeah, you've changed.  I have not.  We used to just go at them from all angles.  Kind of pick your battles.  That one ain't going to be won.  I will say, it didn't work out well.  Why?  In the end.  It worked out well for, like, ratings and notoriety, but in the end, there was all of 2003 and all  of 2015.  Exactly.  Wouldn't we have just been a zoo crew?  Me and Owen.  Montreal or me and Owen.  We really were an alternative couple traveling the country.  We really were. 
[00:44:30]  Why didn't we do that?  All right, well, what can I tell you?  I just want Tom to admit that fun is not the first thing he thinks about in the morning.  I don't even think it's in the top ten.  That's all I want him to admit to.  The company wouldn't fire him.  I mean, you know how bad he...  I don't know.  Everyone is expendable in this new day and age of corporate ownership of everything.  Yeah.  Everyone's expendable.  All right.  Vince McMahon update.  Oh, my God.  Now, at least we're getting into tragedy here. 
[00:45:00]  Wow.  We've got to take a break, though.  The gay bomb.  And yesterday, I think...  I didn't hear about the gay bomb.  Not really.  I think it's just us hanging with us.  Jimmy Norton.  I like when it's just us sometimes.  Me, too.  No, I just thought someone had said Patrici.  I thought Patrici was coming in.  Is that time?  No, yeah.  Tomorrow he'll be in.  I read the email he wasn't coming in, and I was disappointed.  I didn't read it.  By the way, we've got to figure out the Father's Day thing.  Are we going to just hand it over to Bear?  We'll explain...  Oh, here he comes again.  We have to break.  But you can't do that. 
[00:45:30]  Tom is fun.  Well, Tom has more fun than probably anybody in this room.  All right.  What do you do for fun?  Oh, I'll deal with that.  There we go.  You have more fun than Jim Norton?  Are you crazy?  Did you ever fly below the equator to pay for prostitution?  Case closed.  Thank you.  Go.  That's fun.  Can we see on the next break what Tom thinks is fun?  I would like to...  I want to know what Tom thinks is fun.  This show sucks.  No, I think that Tom is interesting.  And look, the guy's been making a lot of money for a long time. 
[00:46:00]  All right.  What do you do for fun?  All sorts of different things.  Every day I wake up, it's fun.  Every day...  Well, if you have been where I've been...  Oh, now he has to make it serious for everybody.  No, I'm going to be serious, but it is serious.  You look at every day...  Every freaking day is fun.  Right.  When you're in Sloan Kettering and you don't know whether you're leaving the hospital or  not, and you do, every day becomes fun.  Except that day.  That day probably wasn't fun.  And you find something to laugh about every day when they're telling you, and they're 
[00:46:30]  telling your wife behind your back whether she doesn't, they don't know whether you're  going to live or not.  Then believe me, every day is a fun day.  I don't want to get too serious.  Oh, no.  You should hang out with Kenny, man.  You know what?  I understand.  The Kenny knows.  Please, Kenny would find the one.  I'd rather hang out with Kenny than your angst.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  There we go.  I like this, man.  Here we go.  This is good.  This is a nice little battle.  I like my angst.  We're just talking about fun.  Yeah, I know.  It's so fun. 
[00:47:00]  And he's proven that he's all about fun, obviously.  I know.  Wow.  Whenever you get that second lease on life, you kind of, you look at every day as, you  know, how am I going to enjoy myself today instead of make myself miserable?  That's, I wouldn't say, that's more of like an attitude in life, which is, you know,  I kind of wish I had.  It's like you just live every day as very full as you can.  And, but what do you, like, what do you do for fun?  What do you go out and do besides the joy of living, which is, you know, something that  I certainly have. 
[00:47:30]  But what do you, go ahead and you talk.  It wasn't my question.  No, that's all right.  What was your question?  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  No, you talk.  Okay.  I know.  I was curious as to what you would do for, like, what do you consider, like, fun things  to do?  Like, that are not just, like, joy of living things, which are, you know, like, what  do you, because honestly, like, when you look at a priest or something, those guys a lot  of times have joy of living.  They're happy with their work.  They're feeling close to God.  But I wouldn't say that they go out and have fun.  I would assume probably golfing with friends is good, playing cards with friends.  You know, starting every morning off, sending my daughter-in-law an annoying note is fun. 
[00:48:00]  You know, finding ways to bother her is fun.  Bothering people.  Exactly.  Annoying people.  I take high joy in annoying people.  I guess he's having fun right at this moment.  Exactly.  Oh, damn.  There's that angst, Tom.  Woo.  Exactly.  All right.  Well, I like how Tom has a podium in here to rest his hands on and give, like, a speech.  But it's too low.  He looks like Herman Munster if he was roasting someone.  Tom makes you feel tall.  His fingertips are just touching the bottom of the podium. 
[00:48:30]  You know what's funny about Tom?  Usually, you know, he would be yelling and screaming that we have to break.  But it's about him, so he'll talk until he's done.  It's about me.  It's fine.  Absolutely.  See?  It's kind of like you.  Do we make you laugh?  Do we make you laugh?  Yes.  All right.  Good.  I don't think you...  I never thought Tom liked me.  No, I've come to like you, Jimmy.  That's great.  I was right, though.  Went through a point of tolerating you.  Oh, please.  At first it was, ugh, and then it was, eh, eh, and now it's...  It's a little past, eh, right.  Yeah. 
[00:49:00]  And now it's the eyebrow raised in the hall.  Right.  It's gone for, eh, to, eh.  You know, did puree...  I think you turned him around when you were talking about his eyes.  I know he's going to make medicine out of a fungus, no?  Right.  Louis Pasteur.  But I never thought of that.  Yeah, yeah.  Fun fact, very fact.  Hey, look what Dan is doing.  Let's take a break.  Thank you, Tom.  It's always a pleasure.  Always.  Are you going to stay there when we break?  No, I only...  Because then it's going to get really awkward.  You start talking about me again, so if you go to break, then it's safe.  Oh, this is going to be fun.  I'm just going to talk about you all day.  I just keep walking down the hall. 
[00:49:30]  He's doing his cardio today, just walking back and forth from the office.  And I purposely wait for him to get all the way back to his office, and then we bring him up again.  You want to hear the shh of the cushy sick down in the lower seat?  I swear to God, I know that it's a long walk, and I'll wait, and then we'll bring him back up again.  Because, you know, he just got comfortable with his morning coffee, and he's like, ah, I've got to get back up and get down there.  You are a bastard.  I love my angst, and I will never lose my angst. 
[00:50:00]  It's a big part of the show.  I'm like a rookie.  What's wrong with me?  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show, if you're just tuning in.  We changed formats here in New York.  Again?  No, I mean, we're doing the K-Rock, the music thing, and we're very, very happy about that, actually.  But coming back, I'm not used to the new sweepers. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  And I'm hitting our music a little early.  Oops.  Way too many times, by the way.  A little premature.  Yeah.  The Free Hugs video is officially up on our website.  Great.  877-212-5762.  Very interactive radio show.  Give us a call if you got something.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Getting very excited about Jones Beach.  Oh, yeah.  Two days out, man.  And the forecast looking pretty good.  Isolated thunderstorms, that's all right.  We could all handle that.  I just saw a weather forecast that said nothing about isolated thunderstorms. 
[00:51:00]  All right, good.  It said partly cloudy and had a big sunshine in the 80s.  Hmm.  We got a Vince McMahon update.  We're following this story very, very closely.  Now Sam's coming over, head down, shaking his head slowly.  I didn't even know Sam was a wrestling fan.  I didn't either.  He kept it to himself.  I knew E-Rock was the big wrestling fan.  You know what?  We got to talk to E-Rock, too, because I think I go up on, I move a spot up on his hero list. 
[00:51:30]  If Vince McMahon's out of the picture.  No, you weren't.  Vince wasn't in between you and number one.  Oh, really?  It was just his dad.  What was that again?  It was his dad and you.  It was his MySpace list of heroes in his life.  And what was it?  Number one?  Is his father.  Is his father.  Then me?  Number two?  Opie.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Right.  Was at number two.  And I didn't even make the list.  Can I ask E-Rock something? 
[00:52:00]  Now, as far as I'm concerned, is it Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony  show?  Or is it the character that I portray on the show?  It did say Opie.  Oh, all right.  And Hulk Hogan was three, right?  Yeah.  Hulk Hogan was three.  So you're squeezed between his dad and Hulk Hogan.  I got confused because I thought Vince McMahon was on the list.  He was a little further down.  Oh, but he was on the list.  How many heroes do you have?  I think there was like 12.  He had like 12. 
[00:52:30]  Yes, Than.  And like anything else we make fun of Eric for, he then removed it from his page within  12 hours.  Of course.  Did you really?  What was your MySpace page?  El Doucho Baggo?  Why did you remove me from, or you removed the heroes list?  The whole list.  Why?  We all have heroes.  All right, Vince McMahon.  Oh, he's nervous.  Wait, why did you remove it?  What's wrong with you?  Because we made fun of him.  Yeah.  I want your heroes list back up there. 
[00:53:00]  I want to know what the heroes list was.  And I want to be moved up past your father.  Wow.  That's a tall order.  Past dear old dad?  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  You rock.  And do it on Father's Day.  Yeah, do it on Father's Day.  And make sure you send out a MySpace bulletin that your dad gets.  Wait.  I got an update on my MySpace account.  I just want everyone to go there and check out the updates.  And your father gets it and realizes he's been knocked down a notch.  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Eric, I just want to know.  Now, heroes are very important things in life, people.  You usually know and are able to convey why they are indeed heroes.  Your father.  Why is your dad a hero?  Besides just, you know, making you, why is your dad your hero?  And why is there not Bette Midler music playing under this?  Bette Midler music.  Whatever.  Why is that song?  Why is Wind Beneath My Wings not playing?  That's true. 
[00:54:00]  Did you ever know?  Wow, stupid.  I went with Mariah Carey hero.  Yeah.  Myself, sure.  That's the greatest hero song.  Is it?  I don't know that one.  I think that's, yeah, the number one hero song.  But Eric aspires to be things.  Yes.  Because you might be the wind beneath his wings, but technically, you don't walk in his shadow.  That's true.  I need to be a huge windstorm to be the wind behind me this way.  I'm just singing to this tsunami.  I wish it was Friday so I could point and laugh.  It's not point and laugh Friday. 
[00:54:30]  It's Fun Fact Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Fun Fact Thursday.  Eric is too fat to be lifted by a little wind.  No disrespect.  I mean, it was a fun fact.  What happened, Iraq?  You don't need to.  You can't find that?  Any music?  Yeah, I got it.  Oh, you got it.  Okay, play it a little.  Hey, I'm your hero.  You better play mine.  Now, this is definitely.  Yeah, see?  I knew he'd pick my song over yours, Jimmy.  I did, too.  Now, Iraq, your dad.  Yeah.  Why is your dad a hero for you? 
[00:55:00]  It's good with money.  Very good with money.  It's good with money.  Yeah.  Why?  Does he know how to steal it from other people on his staff when he wins a lotto off a ticket  that was supposedly community property of the rest?  I forget it.  He's good with money, which means he knows how to send Iraq a lot of money.  Oh, is that it?  He's good with money.  He gives it to me.  A way to find a really emotionally valid reason to love his mother. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, a hero.  The bank should be a hero then.  See, money shouldn't come up.  It should be like stuff like when I need him, he's there for me.  Yeah, but don't give him ideas.  And even though he lives in West Palm Beach and I'm up here in New York, I could call  him any time.  Why do you love your father so much?  He never forgets to carry the six.  So why else would you say dad is a hero?  Wait, who stopped this bit?  Because I know where you're going.  I don't want to see him cry again.  You made him cry last time you did this bit. 
[00:56:00]  I just want to know why his dad is a hero.  And then I might go to number two.  You are going to go to number two.  I might have to go to number two.  And then what happened last time, he got very serious and gave you a serious answer.  And I openly laughed at him and he ran out of the studio crying.  I'll tell you why he picked your song.  Yeah.  Because that song wouldn't hit him as hard as the Bette Midler song.  Yeah.  Yeah, the Bette Midler song would have hit him a little too hard.  That's why he didn't play that thing.  Yeah, he might have gotten a little choked up.  Oh, okay. 
[00:56:30]  All right, continue, Ann.  I don't know how this is going to end.  Well, I just want to know.  Like, all right, let me think.  Even though, because I just want to try to relate to this a little.  Even though my dad, you know, he wasn't exactly the most responsible guy in the world.  Is your dad a hero?  Yes.  My dad's one of my heroes.  I look up to him.  Even though he was very irresponsible as a father, he was a very fun guy to hang out with and talk to.  Like, he enlightened me as far as life goes, real life, not that fake, phony kind of things that dads sometimes tell their kids. 
[00:57:00]  It's things that they think they should tell their kids about life.  My dad really gave it to me straight, told me about life, let me do a lot of things and make mistakes to learn by them.  You know, the analogy of falling off a horse and getting back on it, I actually literally had to do that.  Falling off a horse and getting back on.  A lot of, you know, he called me, gave me a girl for my birthday. 
[00:57:30]  Instead of a 10-speed bike, you got a girl.  Right.  I got to have sex.  At 13?  With a girl.  That's amazing.  And that was all thanks to my hero dad.  Yes.  13.  Yes, 13.  I got a 10-speed bike.  Anthony got a broad.  I got a broad.  And it was just, he treated me like an adult.  And it was very good.  And my dad, yes, one of my heroes, even though I do talk about him yelling at my mommy and making me very scared and giving me stomach aches and throwing spaghetti against the wall. 
[00:58:00]  My dad was my hero, and I miss him.  Aww.  Jimmy, what about your swinging dad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Old, old, wave it in your face, Pop.  Of course.  No, my father's a very sweet guy.  He's very emotional.  He's very affectionate.  My dad's a very nice guy.  Yeah, very supportive of you, too.  Very supportive.  Both my parents are.  Now, Iraq, aside from money, you cold fish. 
[00:58:30]  No, I'm kidding, man.  What, your father.  He's a hero because he's good with money?  He's good with money.  That's great.  Put that other song on before I bite your face.  Put that lovely Bette Midler song on.  I want to hear Bette Midler now.  Oh, all right.  Now we go to Bette Midler.  All right.  Continue.  As Iraq then says, now, besides the money, Iraq, why is your dad your hero, number one  hero?  Well, he's been very supportive as far as work and education.  Don't bite everybody else's hero things that they just gave for their dads.  No, we butted heads a lot as far as education decisions, career decisions, things like that. 
[00:59:00]  But whatever I chose, he was very supportive and helped me out.  I thought you were going to say you guys butted heads as you were both reaching for the donuts.  Oh, damn.  That's not fat.  That isn't even nice.  But they don't know that out there.  That's what makes it funny for them in Tucson.  Right, Tucson?  Right, right.  So he's supportive of what you did. 
[00:59:30]  Sorry, Rock.  Good.  Any other reasons why he would be your hero?  Think of what a hero is to people.  Inspiration, things like that.  Yeah.  There's some things that he's done that I don't think I'm really allowed to mention because  he doesn't want it, known that he did it.  Hitman, nice.  Produced foul pornography?  Right.  What can't you mention?  Oh, Christ.  He probably had the bullies killed.  He used to pick on them. 
[01:00:00]  He kind of has that look like he could have been involved in some things.  He could have been.  Actually, Rock's Tyler is a really good guy.  Yeah.  I just got to step out of my role on the show for a second.  All right, the dad thing is nice.  You almost feel like it's mandatory that a dad be a hero because if he's not,  then you know you're kind of in a screwed up way.  So that's cool.  Let's move on to number two.  Do we have to?  Yes.  Opie is your number two hero right there below dad. 
[01:00:30]  Now, what makes Opie a hero to you?  Hero, not, you know, inspiration, things like that.  I mean, hero is a very strong word.  It is.  It's somebody that you, it's a love.  It's not like I have, I have a great, uh, what's your number two?  I have a great professional respect for, uh, Opie and, and Jimmy.  It's, it's a professional respect.  More me than Jimmy though.  I wouldn't call them heroes.  You got me the gig.  I'm not stupid. 
[01:01:00]  What would I be getting Jimmy water at his shows?  Uncomfortable.  No, he's a dope if he said anything else.  Good point.  But, but like a hero is, that's a strong word.  What makes Opie the number two hero on your list?  Hero is love.  Yeah, it really is.  All right.  Perhaps I wasn't, uh, don't you, don't you back out now.  I'm not backing out, but. 
[01:01:30]  Number two.  If he was number eight.  You seem to be taking hero as literally as, uh, you seem to be taking it.  Oh, hey.  Maybe I, maybe I'm, uh, my, uh, definition of hero is a little different than yours.  What?  Casual pal?  Yeah.  What's your idea of hero?  You put dad at number one.  That should prove that your interpretation of what hero is, is very important and very strong  because it's your father.  So, number two, either there's a big drop off, which is an insult, or he's your hero. 
[01:02:00]  Why is Opie your number two hero?  There's no way this isn't going to sound bad.  The, um, all right.  Be truthful.  You can do the truth.  Don't try to think of something.  I'm not.  Don't try to be cool.  Yeah, just go.  Be truthful.  Go ahead.  Just look down.  I'm not looking at you.  Shut your eyes and really think about it and go.  I'm drawing a blank here. 
[01:02:30]  Hero.  No, but that's not, that's not good.  You're editing yourself.  Yeah, let's go.  Don't be editing yourself.  Put yourself out there for once.  It's okay.  Okay.  When you guys came back to New York, um, I was working in some crappy top 40 station.  And, uh, upon hearing your guys show, I learned a different way to do radio, um, opened my  mind, expanded it to a couple other, uh, areas in this business. 
[01:03:00]  Just trying to figure out where the you guys splits off into Opie.  Yeah, that's the inspired.  I want to see where, where I don't make the list at all.  And Opie's number two.  See, that hurts Anthony deep down.  He'll, he'll never admit it, but Anthony, give me a little REM.  Everybody hurts.  It needs a little.  That's what I want.  I want.  Everybody hurts.  By the way, this made Iraq cry last time.  Everybody hurts.  That's all you're, you want from this, uh, segment. 
[01:03:30]  There we go.  I will cry, but I continue.  So now me and Opie, the show, uh, it, it inspired you, taught you.  Opie's the number two hero.  Yeah.  Continue.  Stop with the safe answers.  Get to the media.  Okay.  Soon to be number one.  Meaningful.  Right.  Right.  When, uh, the time came around where it looked like you guys were coming back to, uh, satellite  radio, which company wasn't determined yet, but Opie contacted me and, uh, offered me  a position to come back to, uh, to come to the show. 
[01:04:00]  What type of relationship did you envision having with Opie?  A guy you respected and hero worshiped.  What type of relationship did you envision having with him?  Um, pretty much how it is now.  I don't believe you.  I don't believe you.  By the way, we contacted you because, uh, there was no one else.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, I'm like, well, there's no one else.  Might as well pick a fan of the show.  We'll be able to boss him around a little more than others.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh.  Because if you've got a guy that's actually been in a bunch of markets, he's not going  to listen to us.  He's not going to try as hard.  We need a pushover.  We need a pushover.  I don't believe Iraq when he says pretty much the way it is now. 
[01:05:00]  I want to know, truthfully, what did you think your relationship, or what did you want?  What kind of relationship did you want?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Seriously, to be part of the show.  Like, to be, um...  Well, not to this extent of the trashing that I take on a daily basis.  But you, uh...  Does it ever hurt you?  Does Opie ever hurt your feelings?  Not in a long time, I don't think so.  Oh, not in a long time.  When does he hurt your feelings for real?  I would say about two minutes ago.  Yeah, but when the mics are off, you know what? 
[01:05:30]  It's a little different.  I think...  And I don't even need to, like, explain that on the air.  No.  I'm confident in myself.  He's confident in what he does.  No, he's not.  And it's different when we're doing it.  How could he be?  Are you kidding me?  No one else is.  The only thing preventing him from blowing his head off with a shotgun is the thing that  it might get better.  All right, let's be honest.  I barely know you exist.  I want to know when has Opie hurt your feelings?  I don't remember.  I don't believe it.  Yeah, you do.  No, seriously. 
[01:06:00]  You remember every little raw moment.  I just know that the relationship...  I know the relationship he wanted and the type of job he wanted here was like...  You ever see those TV shows where there's the talk show host and the producer?  And they, like, hang out and talk to each other.  And the guy's in the booth going, and go!  And there's this respect.  And the talk show host talks to the producer and is like, what are we going to do about  this situation?  And the producer's, like, in there.  I think that's what Iraq kind of envisioned. 
[01:06:30]  A right-hand man type of thing.  Right.  Yes.  Sort of a right-hand man.  Yes.  Like an Ed and Johnny type of thing.  Like a...  Yep.  Two comrades in arms, in a way.  Yeah.  I love the boss.  You're in it together.  That's it.  I was looking for a right-hand man, and then I realized that he had a...  He had, like, a flipper for a hand.  You know, you have a high position on the show, and then these guys are brought on, and  sometimes they give you the guff. 
[01:07:00]  Unfortunately, Danny, you ass, because these guys love this stuff, he reminds me of the  time that we ditched him at Giant Stadium.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  After the Stones concert, right?  Yeah.  Now, that had a hurt, right?  That had a hurt, not only on a level where you're stuck somewhere, which just sucks, but  that had a hurt on a level like, if I was really taken as an equal with all the other  guys and as respected, they never would have done this to me. 
[01:07:30]  I'm thinking.  Yeah.  Now, I wasn't party to that.  I forgot what happened.  What happened, Iraq?  Refresh my memory.  It was the day after winning the lottery.  Yeah.  The Rolling Stones concert at Giant Stadium.  I was supposed to meet up with them because my tickets were in the same section as theirs,  and as soon as the concert was over, I called Ben.  Ben mumbled something like he was pretending that he couldn't hear me and hung up.  I got to be honest.  It was his idea. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  But it was pretty funny.  I got him.  So you were on this emotional lie.  You had won.  You were going to see the Rolling Stones with your buddy.  And then Ben was the producer at the time.  I mean, Opie's Opie, and you're going with the guys who are your bosses.  We waited.  We had to wait at least five minutes in the parking lot.  How did you feel?  We gave him five minutes.  Well, there was 80,000 people.  Of course.  We had to wait a little bit.  Five minutes.  We figured he would get caught up with the mob of people leaving the stadium.  How did you feel when they left? 
[01:08:30]  I was pissed off.  But I mean...  What were you feeling when you went to where the car used to be?  I just saw the oil stains in the parking space.  Instead of being the big radio guy and things doing good and you're on the radio in New York,  you're just the little fat kid from Florida again.  Jimmy, it was the Rolling Stones, first time some of us ever saw the Rolling Stones.  There was a skipping E-Rox step as he's going back to the car. 
[01:09:00]  He's probably thinking of talking about the show with all the guys.  Hey, Opie, my hero, number two.  Did you see the way they hit the stage?  It was amazing.  He can't wait to call Shotgun.  Right.  Shotgun, backseat, guys.  I'm riding up front.  For the slow ride back to Manhattan and then empty parking spot.  So when you're standing there, what does that do?  Are you like all of a sudden you're not the radio?  Like all of a sudden like, wow, man, I'm not like the radio guy who gets the respect.  Like I'm just that little loser who always knew he was going to be a loser. 
[01:09:30]  Like, I'm talking about the way your mind talks to you.  I'm not talking about him, but that's the way you think in moments like that.  Like I thought I was somebody special.  I thought this was going to be something.  And I am just thinking that I'm the butt of a joke.  Yeah.  And I've always been the butt of a joke.  Like that's the way I'm saying your self-perception.  No.  How did you feel?  I was pissed off.  I was walking around like, all right, maybe I'm in the wrong section.  And then I recognized where I was. 
[01:10:00]  I would go, I went, oh crap, I am in the right section.  I'm like, no, they didn't leave.  They left.  They were gone.  That was great about him being pissed off.  I just went, you got to take it.  I'm one of your bosses.  Oh, Eric's not good at this revealing emotional answer.  No, he's not.  He tries to.  He's a sweet guy, but he's not good at revealing emotional answers.  He tries to be strong and like, you know, I was pissed off.  And meanwhile, inside, right below that surface is somebody who's really hurt. 
[01:10:30]  You know what?  Iraq is getting tougher though.  Is he?  Yeah, we're toughening him up.  He'd have been crying by now last year.  He's not going to cry.  He won't cry.  I just want to know emotionally how he felt for real.  We're getting that top 40 wussiness out of him.  We really are.  He's changing.  For the better, I think.  New hero list.  You're going to put one up?  Uh-oh, his mouth's getting dry.  I could hear it.  I suppose I could.  He's getting tougher though.  I really, it has to be said. 
[01:11:00]  How disappointed are you, Dan?  You didn't get tears from the kid.  You freak.  I know.  What a waste of tape.  You know, the people out there that think I'm an ass, you have every right to think that.  You have no idea how much worse it gets off air with these clowns.  That's what I'm asking him now.  I'm saying, do you hate when these guys kind of team up on you?  Like it's those three or those four against you. 
[01:11:30]  And you're probably like, why am I not teamed up with somebody or part of that team?  Like, what did I do wrong?  Yeah, how did Sam pass you by?  Actually, Sam kind of stands out from everybody because he doesn't just, oh yeah, maybe I  get the brunt of most of this, but he does go after everybody else.  But you go after him.  Like, why would you let Sam bully you?  And that's what it is, bullying.  Nah, not really.  Yes.  And did you notice that Sam only started being nice to you when you started getting  him stuff?  Not true. 
[01:12:00]  What did he get him, man?  What is he getting you?  Wait, what did he get him?  You know.  No, Eric and me are just friends.  We talk about wrestling.  We have a lot in common.  A lot in common.  He's on my hero's list.  What a smart ass.  Is Eric trying to be nicer to Sam, like with little gifts and little things like that,  because he doesn't want to be humiliated by Sam by being filmed all the time and stuff  like that?  What did you get you?  Eric has done a lot with his connections to the WWE to get me some nice things, and  I've shown my appreciation because we're friends. 
[01:12:30]  By not bullying him as much, but the second that pipeline of goods gets cut off.  Yeah, as soon as you realize he had a nice connection with the WWE, you're like, oh,  well, I like the WWE.  That's not true.  Yeah, you had to make some sacrifices, didn't you?  No.  No.  He does.  E-Rock does have, he has major connections with the WWE.  Yeah.  So he would leave the show tomorrow if they gave him a good gig over there.  This is real to me, man.  See, he's laughing now. 
[01:13:00]  All right, we got to take a break, E-Rock.  I don't like the fact that E-Rock didn't give any, I don't think you lied, but he didn't  give any real, emotionally.  Yeah, no real honesty there.  For another day, for another day.  We got to talk about the gay bomb still.  Oh, yeah.  This was a real thing that was going on.  The gay bomb, McGreevy's wife's book?  Yeah.  That is flopping horribly.  The thing tanked.  And he's blaming her clothing on Oprah.  It's like, Jim, you humiliated her.  Yeah.  What are you expecting to do?  I'm a gay American?  Well, she sits there going, I tried, but I guess it wasn't good enough. 
[01:13:30]  She found out, like, just beforehand.  Yeah.  She walks out.  And then he's saying her book's flopped because she went on Oprah in an ill-fitting gown.  Like, he notices her gown is ill-fitting.  Catty fruit?  You humiliated her.  It was sized for you.  Yeah, she went into the wrong closet.  Oh, damn.  This is his, not mine?  How did I make this mistake?  Chest hairs in the little open swoop neck.  A karate cologne or something? 
[01:14:00]  Best I could come up with on the spot.  High karate.  Thank you.  He probably would wear that.  Yeah.  All right.  E-Rock, very good.  Yeah.  And, hey, you know what?  Why don't we give away a pair of tickets for Jones Beach?  Wow.  Saturday's a big show.  Nine comedians from the program that you know and love.  All the info is on MySpace under Virus Tour.  One word, Virus Tour.  But, basically, it's Saturday.  Jones Beach.  Tickets still available.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  A random caller right now that could use the tickets. 
[01:14:30]  We'll get them.  877-212-5762.  It's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  92-3.  K-Rock.  It's Opie and Anthony and a little Jimmy Norton.  What's going on today, by the way?  It's got to be acknowledged.  Ever since we made fun of the Yankees and Roger Clemens coming back.  Roger Clemens.  Oh, my God. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, my goodness gracious.  Oh, yeah.  She doesn't say God, right?  No, goodness gracious.  Goodness gracious.  Everyone's distracted now.  This Red Rum's showering again on Pal Talk.  Hi, Red Rum.  Clean yourself.  Very good.  There she is.  Showering.  I love the...  Oh, can you see the bottom?  Yeah, you can definitely see...  And if you get Pal Talk, you can do video conferencing.  You can have meetings.  Yes.  No matter where you are in America, really. 
[01:15:30]  That's why they're getting it.  Share your conversations.  Share your conversations with Grandma.  She could see the kids as they grow up.  No, it's all about shower cams.  Right.  Just nudity.  I love how they try to sell products.  You can now talk to Grandma.  Yeah.  She's in Wisconsin.  You're in Florida.  You get to talk to her.  Put the grandkids in front of her.  Hi, Grandma.  Yeah, that's what it's all about.  No, it's just girls showering and doing all sorts of other things.  It's about seeing shampoo foam going down a butt crack. 
[01:16:00]  And if you're lucky, a soap scoop.  Yeah, a little soap scoop.  Soap scoop.  Has anybody heard McCartney's new album?  No.  I hate the picture.  Excuse me, why would we?  I know he's a very popular guy.  Oh.  Was.  He still is.  He's McCartney.  Yeah.  He's looking more like an old woman every day, though.  I hate the picture on the cover of it.  Like, he's almost, he's almost going like, who?  Me?  Let me see.  No, that's, that's not the album cover.  Oh, okay.  Bring it up right now, Eric, before I start biting.  He, uh, I've got a suit jacket on, and he's like holding the lapels of it. 
[01:16:30]  Like, who?  And there's photos of him.  And he's like peeking in.  Like, he's just kind of pure.  It's awful.  Is it really?  He has percy lips.  You would think he'd have that figured out by now.  His album.  I saw a picture of him the other day in the paper, and he has lipstick on.  Now, I know they do that type of thing for photo shoots and stuff, but they  usually are able to hide it, but it's so obvious he's wearing lipstick.  It's blatant lipstick.  By the way, what I was saying about the Yankees are on this ridiculous  winning streak ever since we made fun of that whole mess.  Yep.  Some would say they've been on a winning streak since A-Rod got caught with 
[01:17:00]  the stripper.  Yeah.  It seems like he doesn't care anymore.  That's a weight off his shoulders.  Right.  That's a weight off of his shoulders.  Now, he can just play ball.  Yeah, well.  He doesn't have to worry about, uh-oh, am I going to get caught?  Is this what's happening here?  He can just, eh.  What are they?  I can play baseball.  They've won nine in a row or something like that.  Yeah, they're cranking it.  And we were laughing and making fun of Roger Clemens because he was doing all  these practice warm-up starts with all these ridiculous teams all over  America.  Yeah.  What does he do? 
[01:17:30]  He has an amazing outing his first time out.  This is coming from a Mets fan, by the way.  The Mets, uh, oof, they're self-destructing.  A little bit, a little bit.  But it's early in the season.  Who would even talk?  Come on.  How about Boston?  What about Boston?  Are they doing well?  What do you think?  I haven't kept tabs.  Oh, you've kept tabs.  Of course you have.  No.  All right, government.  Catching up, though, you know.  Government had plans for the gay bomb. 
[01:18:00]  The gay bomb.  And it says AP.  It has to be true.  All right, I got it.  Now, I got to speculate here.  Now, I'm going to take a guess.  Don't wreck the fun of this.  I'm not going to wreck the fun.  I just don't know what this is supposed to do.  Does the bomb get rid of gay people?  Or does it make people gay?  See, it's the gay bomb.  So is it like a neutron bomb that destroys life but leaves the building standing? 
[01:18:30]  Actually.  And this one would destroy gay people but keep people that aren't gay standing, which would  be the homophobic bomb.  Or is it a bomb that makes people gay?  It's a cartoon bomb, if you remember cartoons.  So the bomb enters the area in an open field.  And all of a sudden, it doesn't explode.  No.  All of a sudden, it unfolds and it's like speakers and stuff.  I'm making this up on the spot.  Okay.  And then it starts blasting Ethel Merman music. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  And then the soldiers that were in hiding that enjoy Ethel Merman type music all of a  sudden start marching toward the bomb because they enjoy the music.  And then they're out in the open and then all hell breaks loose for those poor people.  You could also have it unfold into a gay club that's just blasting techno music.  And then when they come out of the woods, like you said, bang, bang.  Bang, bang.  Now, let's find out about the gay bomb. 
[01:19:30]  This is real.  The government was working on a, quote, gay bomb.  In the long history of war, it may have been one of the craziest, downright laughable ideas.  Downright.  A so-called gay bomb.  The idea was that if soldiers suddenly all became irresistible to one another, that unit...  Oh, my God.  This guy's having a hard time.  It's like E-Rock drinking the water.  If they became irresistible to each other. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, God.  I'm on national TV.  I hope I could say this without anyone knowing what I'm into.  Oh, God.  This is awful.  Irresistible.  Soldiers suddenly all became irresistible to one another.  I can't get that.  Irresistible.  Oh, God.  I think that guy had a visual pop into his head at that moment.  Guess when the visual popped into this guy's head. 
[01:20:30]  And just imagine, you've got imaginations out there.  Imagine what he's visualizing here.  If soldiers suddenly all became irresistible to one another.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Yes, private.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's when it wore off.  Steve says it's terrible. 
[01:21:00]  I'm sorry.  But can we do that again?  Lead scientist, Steve Carlisi.  I won't have any of my men do anything I wouldn't be willing to do first.  Even before the bomb exploded.  Go in there, private.  One of the side effects of the gay bomb, you lose your eyebrows.  Oh, the fallout.  Fallout.  Well, all the men loved Steve because he was a good commander because he just loved all  the privates. 
[01:21:30]  I stand behind all of my men on the battlefield and in the showers.  He dug a foxhole and he encouraged all the men to jump into.  Okay, terrific.  You can jump into my foxhole any time.  It was a training exercise, sir.  Get rid of those pants.  The enemy will see you.  Shaved his eyebrows in case Al-Qaeda caught him. 
[01:22:00]  They would have nothing to hold on to as they decapitated him.  Does he...  Do they hold on eyebrows?  No, they don't.  It was a way to try to find an eyebrow joke and there's none there.  Of course not.  All right.  More about the gay bomb.  Soldiers suddenly all became irresistible to one another. 
[01:22:30]  Morale and cohesion would break down and the enemy would be unable to resist.  The idea of a non-lethal chemical bomb containing aphrodisiacs was among nearly 200 proposals  the Pentagon received in 1994, this one from an Air Force lab in Ohio.  It pitched what it called a distasteful but completely non-lethal example, especially if  the chemical also caused homosexual behavior.  Non-lethal until 20 years later.  Wow. 
[01:23:00]  You drop a...  What the bomb was, they would drop radios out and they'd all be playing the soundtrack  from Wicked.  That's great.  Jared might piss Anthony off here.  Jared, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  I know what the gay bomb really is.  It's whenever that comedian Ant told a joke.  Oh, okay.  Oh, that guy.  Oh, a different Ant.  Ah, I thought I was kidding me.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Is it like the two A-bombs they made back in World War II?  They only have two of these.  We have dill and doe.  An S-bomb and a D-bomb.  Oh, boy.  We're revving up.  Getting ready for takeoff with the gay bomb bit.  Let's try Michael in Louisiana.  And Michael, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I love the show, man.  Yeah.  Thanks, Mike. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Fun fact about the gay bomb.  Sam dropped it on Vince McMahon so Vince McMahon would fall in love with him, but it backfired.  That was actually a poignant statement.  Here's a real fun fact about that thing, though.  You cannot blow up a body and not have bone fragments.  I used to cremate bodies for a living, and that fire would not have incinerated his body.  Sam's an idiot for believing that.  You know what's weird? 
[01:24:30]  You're still cremating bodies.  About 1,000 people left the show because of you.  That's right, sir.  They have disappeared from the listening experience of the Opie and Anthony show.  The next time you start that pyre up, fall into it.  All right.  More about the gay bomb.  This is a surprise, actually.  Government said it was reviewed, and then they rejected the gay bomb.  How much money?  That's what I want to know. 
[01:25:00]  You know when you read that article?  Huh?  That's good.  You know, you read those articles every once in a while, and you learn like a rivet costs $1,000.  A taxpayer, you know, dollars or whatever.  Yeah, how much money went into the development?  Research on the gay bomb.  Research and development of the gay bomb.  Right.  You know what it was?  They probably had to follow up, but the researchers got a little whiff of the chemicals,  and they couldn't do anything.  They're like, how are we coming with the frog?  Oh, oh, oh. 
[01:25:30]  The Defense Department says it had all the ideas reviewed,  and that the gay bomb proposal was among those not making the cut.  The Pentagon released a statement saying it never investigated the concept.  It was just one individual putting together a concept paper with a variety of examples that were rejected.  But members of the California watchdog group Sunshine Project don't buy that.  When the Pentagon says that they rejected this proposal, it's simply not true, 
[01:26:00]  and we have the facts to demonstrate that they've continued to think about it  and to consider it in the years since it was first raised.  In San Francisco's Castro District, the idea of a gay bomb, whether considered or not,  was good for some laughs.  Do they really think that, like, faced with, like, guns and, like, being killed,  they're really going to choose sex?  People still have such a misunderstanding of sexuality in general,  not just homosexuality, but sexuality in general,  that they think that it could be used as a weapon. 
[01:26:30]  Like, when has that ever worked?  Yeah, this is...  When you're mad at your father?  They realized it wasn't going to work when they figured out that  one guy would be shot in the buttocks,  and the other guy would get hit in the face.  You're killing one, yet only wounding the other.  Yeah, they're going to choose gay sex over protecting themselves?  Yeah, I know.  The gunfire's blaring over your head, bombs are blowing up, 
[01:27:00]  but you just can't resist a little sex with another man on the battlefield.  Well, the primate was like an ecstasy vibe, probably.  You just want to be touched and stuff like that.  Is that it?  I'm guessing, yeah.  Your whole concept of survival goes away?  To get touched by another man?  Let me tell you something.  If you're in a battle situation,  and nude broads are throwing themselves at you,  you're not going to think,  hey, maybe I'm going to grab a little piece of ass before I get killed. 
[01:27:30]  You're going to fight.  It's not about the battle moment, though.  I think it's more about the morale.  They probably figured that it would cause them to behave in ways that they normally wouldn't behave in sexually promiscuous ways.  Yeah?  Yeah, it wasn't for a moment like, all right, the troops are running in, drop the gay bomb,  and while they're all on their knee, it's not the...  Oh, back at the barracks, you mean?  Yeah, of course.  It was probably something that would kill morale or something more than an immediate, you know...  Mm.  You know, an immediate thing. 
[01:28:00]  Little relationships happening and breakups and dissension in the ranks.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Doing other things to Private Ryan besides saving him.  But each soldier can carry three more hand grenades.  Gutshot Drew writes,  I heard a rear admiral brought this to the table.  Who knew the old rear admiral was coming into the...  Gotta love... 
[01:28:30]  We'll accept any rear admiral joke on this show.  Thank God, once it's done in the Navy, we'd be really on a roll, wouldn't we?  Debbie, Long Island, what's up?  Hi, I'm cool, I have a quick question for you.  Yeah, yeah.  You're talking about the gay bomb, and then if they drop the gay bomb, it might kill all gay people.  What would this do to bisexual people then?  No, it doesn't kill gay people.  No, it doesn't kill gay people, it turns people gay.  What it does is it makes Army guys drink Navy guys. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, it makes the Army guys drink the Navy guys.  Yeah, it releases some kind of hormone, I guess.  Yeah.  I don't know what they figured.  Oh, my God.  Does it only work on soldiers?  It wouldn't work on civilians?  Why wouldn't it work on civilians?  Of course, it works on everybody.  Well, I was asking because you guys are sitting there going back and forth about how it only goes...  You're talking about Army men and Navy men.  Well, they would only drop it on soldiers.  Yeah, let's be honest.  The guys are doing the heavy lifting over there.  I mean, God bless the broads over there, but... 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  I guess I got to keep my fiancÃ©e for...  Oh, hey!  She's just a banner phone call.  Wow.  My goodness.  She started off going, well, it would kill gay people.  No, that wasn't...  No one said it was going to kill...  She's like, what would it do to bisexuals?  I don't know, blow their legs off.  We weren't talking about killing people.  I don't know, Debbie.  Who dropped the stupid C-bomb?  I don't know, Debbie.  We're a comedy show just trying to get a couple chuckles out of this dumb story.  Out of a gay-bomb joke.  Well, how does it affect bisexual people?  I don't... 
[01:30:00]  I don't know.  Let's do a study.  Right.  Idiot.  Right.  Thanks for ruining the bit.  It's a gay-bomb story.  A few laughs.  Go to break.  That's what we do.  Did you like my line about the Army guys drinking there?  Yeah.  Of course.  That was pretty good, Jim.  Not like that.  That was terrific, actually.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll take another break.  And you know what?  Why don't we do another pair of tickets to Jones Beach?  Oh, my God.  I think we have another pair of tickets.  And we're going to throw in...  You're like Ticketron today.  Well, we're throwing in meet-and-greet passes, too, for the Traveling Virus Comedy Show this 
[01:30:30]  Saturday at Jones Beach, brought to you by Bud Light, Always Worth It, Bob Kelly, Bob  Saget, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, Louis C.K., Otto and George, Patrice O'Neill, Rich  Vosch, Stephen Lynch.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com.  I have an idea.  Yeah.  If they want to get the meet-and-greet tickets, they have to know the secret password.  What is it?  What is it, Jimmy?  Marr.  So now Travis has to hear that?  He certainly does.  All right.  But that's just for the meet-and-greet.  You get the tickets if you call in, but then the secret password is... 
[01:31:00]  Marr.  877-212-5762.  By the way, because we're doing a lot of cities this summer, you go to VirusTour, one word  on MySpace for all the updates as the summer moves along here, okay?  Right.  You know what, Travis?  Watch this.  Watch this.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Yes?  Do you know the secret...  What is it, Jimmy?  Secret password?  What's the secret password?  The secret password is gaybomb.  No, I'm sorry.  Good day, sir. 
[01:31:30]  That was a summation of your call.  They thought we were kidding.  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  When other radio stations do this, they do it so smoothly.  I know.  Hello?  Hi, caller.  Hello?  You just said hello, dude.  You, that said hello.  Say hello again.  Everyone say hi on the phone.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Stupid.  He hung up.  Hopefully died.  Hello?  Hello?  Hey.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  You want to win the Jones Beach tickets?  Yes, I do.  Congratulations.  You got them.  Do you want the meet and greet tickets? 
[01:32:00]  Sure.  Okay.  What's the password?  Perfect.  Jimmy, I like it.  Perfect.  What's your name, sir?  That's his name.  And where are you from?  West Avalon.  And I want to ask the obvious question.  Why haven't you bought the tickets for the thing yet?  Because I just bought a house.  I didn't have money to buy them.  All right.  What's more important?  A house ticket.  After you buy a house, what are tickets?  Yeah, all right.  Well, you know, I asked him, and he came up with a good reason. 
[01:32:30]  Push on hold, and Travis will take you in.  Travis, line eight for the virus tickets.  Thank you, sir.  We'll see you at Jones Beach.  No, and don't, if anyone screws this up, the password is, it has to start with a light  M sound.  If you call up with, you get nothing.  You got to go, you have to struggle.  Are they going to let us play that?  Why?  Is it an FCC violation?  No, we're thinking of, I mean, Stephen Lynch is one of the comedians. 
[01:33:00]  He has a song, a nice gay song, but I don't know if they're going to dump.  Oh, they'll dump.  One dump, they're saying?  All right, we'll give it a shot.  What the hell?  Oh, I know.  Here's Stephen Lynch as we go to break.  I doubt it.  On Opie and Anthony.  Good luck.  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, this one's for you.  Here we are, dear old friend You and I, drunk again 
[01:33:30]  Laughs have been had Tears have been shed  Maybe the whiskey's gone to my hand  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance 
[01:34:00]  But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants  It's not that I don't care  I do  I just don't see myself in you  Another time, another scene  I'd be right behind you 
[01:34:30]  If you know what I mean  Cause if I were gay, I would give you my soul  And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being  And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls  But I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my hand  It's radio, you know  We've never hugged 
[01:35:00]  We've never kissed  But you have opened brand new doors  Get over here and drop your drawers  Head over to Truvio.com 
[01:35:30]  The web's hardest working video search engine  Every day, tons of new videos are uploaded for your enjoyment  From news to sports to entertainment and viral  You can find it at Truvio.com  That's T-R-U-V-E-O.com  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  92.3 K-Rock  Oh my god  You're sick  Ah, it's a little bit of reality 
[01:36:00]  You want to share it with everybody?  Yeah  We're two days out from Father's Day  And, you know, Ant and I are thinking of our dads  That are no longer around  And it's no longer on this plane of existence  And all kidding aside  Because I do have a lot of family that listen to us every morning  I'm beyond bummed about it  Of course  Father's Day sucks  You're gonna be bummed  But, uh, Ant just gave everyone a good taste of reality in the studio  Well, we were talking about other, you know, famous people that have had parents die  After they've, you know, had a great year 
[01:36:30]  Or made it big or something like that  And I was just saying  Well, must be nice  Well, like, my dad lived long enough to know that we were gonna be okay with the radio show  Oh, yeah  You know, like, I mean  Ah, it was three days after I signed the contract  But, ah  Ah  Who's keeping track?  But, ah  At least he knew that we were coming back  And making our big radio comeback  Hey, at least he knew  Never got to actually hear the radio comeback  But, good enough, I'll take it 
[01:37:00]  At least he knew he had a career  And that's when Anthony decided to say one of the sickest things I've probably ever heard  Just like, hey, my father didn't, uh, no, he's frozen in, in time somewhere  Thinking I'm still a tin knocker  Just kind of like, how's, how's he doing?  How's he doing knocking tins?  Ah, my boy never amounted to much  Ah, boy, I wish he would have been able to, you know, fulfill his dream of maybe doing radio or some type of comedy  But, no, I'm just dead 
[01:37:30]  I got some, uh, religious people in, in my, in my circle  Yeah  You know, that whole thing I just told you  Uh-huh  Like, you know, at least he knew that we were gonna make our comeback in radio  Yeah  But it's kind of a bummer that he's, he doesn't know how successful we would, we would become  We would go on to come, yeah  Right  And some people in my circle, they're dramatic  Oh, this one  I know where you're going  Oh, oh, he knows  He knows  He knows  Let me tell you something  He's looking down on you every day 
[01:38:00]  He's watching you right now  And he knows  Trust me, he knows  It's like, why is he only looking down on me when I'm here doing radio and he's all smiling  Is he looking at me when I'm flipping my chick over?  Uh, and  Yeah, so  Is dad taking a peek in when I'm just scrapping?  See, if, if that is true, then yeah, your parents, your dead relatives, whatever, are watching you when you do those horrific things that you don't want anyone to know about  And if heaven is real, and if that's where you go when you're, you've done well, and you get to see all the glory of the universe, I don't think anybody's family is thinking, how's the syndication going? 
[01:38:30]  I think there are other wonders, like what black holes really are, and you mean Hitler had a sense of humor?  And wow, what were all of these people, I don't think they're worried about  I heard they dropped in men 18 to 54  Yeah, how are they doing this month?  If I, if I know my dad, you know, he's definitely taking a peek if this is all true, and he's proud of me and all that, but I think he's spending a hell of a lot more time in the JFK room 
[01:39:00]  Right  You know, just trying to find out  So that's what happened  Exactly  Yeah  Exactly  Have a little chit chat with JFK  Right, in Maryland  I don't know where it came from  Right, right  You know, get a Lee Harvey, talk to him  He's in the JFK library in heaven, getting all the facts that we're still wondering about  Well, my parents have lived, thank God, to see their success  Yes, they've seen me do well so far  Swinging lifestyle must be healthy, and it's great  Did they come back from Bermuda yet?  I haven't, I don't know  You don't want to know 
[01:39:30]  I don't even want to hear the message again  My father's going to be all sunburned with his, you know, like corn chip toenails  Oh, hey  What are you doing?  Got my line in there, I don't care who uses it  As long as it gets out  That was a stretch, Jimmy, come on  I don't know what to say  I do a bit like that, I can't help it  The next time you see your parents, he's going to be all tan  And he's going to go, look, Jimmy, huh?  No tan lines  Oh, those nude beaches are the best  I wish I could find them  I'll play it tomorrow 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, get the message, will you?  So where were we?  Dead parents  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Yeah, actually my dad wound up dying like in January, I think it was 95?  Just before we  January 95, April 95, I'm doing radio in Boston  Oh, but then he kind of knew you were on your way because we started before then  Yes, I was telling him I was doing like radio, you know, part-time and stuff  Alright, so you had a little hope then  Yeah, it could have been a little hope, but it was pretty much me drunk on the Opie Nighttime Attitude show on BAB 
[01:40:30]  He was probably thinking, alright, my son might be a weekend jock soon  Yeah, exactly  That's probably what he's thinking, has no clue that we became what we became  I don't even think it got that far, I think it was like, I'm hanging out with friends kind of a thing  I have a fun fact  Alright, hold on  Fun fact  Perel guy though, just because I plunked him down  Sure  Perel guy from Pal Talk  Hello  Perel guy from Pal Talk 
[01:41:00]  Go ahead, buddy  Yes, sir, good morning guys, how you doing?  Hi  Good  I would love some of those meet and greet because I never met you guys and I'd love to meet and greet you  Okay, do you want tickets to Jones Beach?  Sounds kind of creepy  I would love to meet and greet you  I have very good tickets for Jones Beach  Because you guys are worth the money  I spent the  And you want meet and greet passes?  Yeah, I'd love to meet you guys  Are you hot?  I'm very hot  I'm very hot  Yeah, I'm about five foot  Well, you had to see if he had the password  Yeah, I wonder if he had it 
[01:41:30]  No  Why?  I like the fact he paid for tickets and wanted to  No  Because what if he had it?  I say call back  Then he would have had it  No  As long as he knows the password  No  If he knows the password, then we have to meet and greet him  I want to  I'll meet him  You greet him  I'll greet him like a man's never greeted another guy  What do you got, Jim?  Well, my friend Liza said, good morning  Here's a fun fact for Anthony  Okay  Hitler's elevator up to the Eagle's Nest 
[01:42:00]  Was lined with brass due to his little known claustrophobia  I don't know what brass would do  What would brass do?  Maybe, maybe, because it's reflective, it made it feel bigger  Maybe it felt bigger, right  Or more solid, I don't know what that did  Mirrors would be cheaper  Why would that?  Well, maybe they didn't want to use mirrors because it was kind of dangerous  Yeah, I don't know what you're thinking of  If you're in the elevator and a bomb goes off, that glass goes everywhere  Well, he must have hated the bunker  Oh, yeah  It's a fun fact Thursday, and that's a good fun fact  Yes, thank you, Liza  Why is it fun? 
[01:42:30]  It involves Hitler  Why is it fun?

[01:45:00]  Is this perv news Thursday?  No, it's fun fact Thursday  It could be a fun fact about perverts  No, I think every day there's a different type of news  And I think today's is perv news Thursday, right?  I can't keep track of all the days anymore  Then, right?  Yeah  Okay  Write it down  Because next Thursday it'll be perv news Thursday  Okay  Uh, perv news Thursday  We got two cute little perv stories  Aw  We'll lump them together here  Janky Avenue in downtown Covington  Is a place neighbors love to cheer about 
[01:45:30]  But in recent days  A peeping Tom has left a sour taste in people's mouths  Ew  What aim he must have  More than just a peeping Tom  Like shooting clowns at the carnival  I aim for the mouth and their hats blow off  You win a suspended sentence  These news reports are getting great  They suspended a sentence  He went free of that very day  Ow  Yeah, come on  That's a joke  That's, that's, come on  That's right  Janky Avenue in downtown Covington 
[01:46:00]  By the way, you gotta decide which perv news story is worse, okay?  Mm-hmm  We got two today  Covington is a place neighbors love to cheer about  But in recent days  A peeping Tom has left a sour taste in people's mouths  The last person he, uh, attacked  Were two 12-year-old girls  Covington police say the man roams between houses  He walks naked with a ski mask covering his face  He initially stood in the street  But now they say he's hiding on porches  Looking through windows  Prompting at least six complaints 
[01:46:30]  This weekend alone  Police suspect more people have seen the prowler  But are not taking him seriously  How does it prompt complaints  And not shotgun blasts through the window?  Jesus  And why are you walking around naked with a ski mask?  Like, let's just say you have clothes on  And you yank it out  Let's say you see a cop turn the corner  You can always take off your ski mask  And try to walk normally  Yeah  What do you do when you're nude with a ski mask?  How do you play that off?  I just don't look at him  Just don't look at him  I'm not here  I'm waiting for the snow  Probably  And I'm hot 
[01:47:00]  Probably because it's the police chief  You know what?  You're right  He'd be wearing his uniform  And look silly  Alright, well  That guy is going to end up  Getting the crap beat out of him  I hope so  By some father  That catches him  And goes outside  And just beats him senseless  Yeah, I hope so  I was right  Alright  What a creep  And then you got this one  That might top that one  Perv News Thursday  Oklahoma police are searching for a man 
[01:47:30]  Who's been visiting convenience stores  Wearing only a diaper  Okay, I like this guy  At least he's wearing a ditey  Wearing a diaper  What are you thinking?  Some people are just completely out of their minds  As you're driving to the convenience store  You have to stop at a light  Does it ever hit you like  I'm in a diaper?  You don't just think of it and be there  Yeah 
[01:48:00]  You're not just there going  Whoa, what happened?  And what kind of shoes do you wear?  You have to park  Do you go barefoot?  I would say flip-flops  Go with the flips?  Yeah  You gotta show your bare feet  Kind of  But you need  What about  You can't run on  What about a nice  Nike shoe?  That just looks silly  Yeah  Yeah  Cowboy boots  Now you're really looking silly  And you can't run  You need something you can run away in  So I'm thinking  Some type of  Running shoe  What are those sandals that have like the sneaker bottom? 
[01:48:30]  Well there's like  Teva's got  Teva  Yeah  That's it  That's what you wear  That's what you wear  Yeah  Sure  Oklahoma police are searching for a man who's been visiting convenience stores  Wearing only a diaper  The man seen here on this surveillance video has walked into several mini-marts  He's marched up to the counter in the diaper  And asked the workers what they think about it  Most employees laugh at first thinking it's some kind of dare  But then the man has exposed himself falling out of the diaper  And now there's  He means business 
[01:49:00]  At first it's all fun and games  What do you think of my diaper?  Hey that's hysteria  Oh Jesus  Come on  I'm eating a hot dog here  My first thought  If you're going to expose yourself  I wouldn't go with the diaper  I would go with something a little different  A little more easy access  Something that doesn't look ridiculous  Because you go  I imagine you would be going for a nice reaction  Yeah  Instead of like  You know  Someone laughing at you  Because you're wearing the diaper  Yeah true  Diapers just look silly on people 
[01:49:30]  It doesn't make sense  At first thinking it's some kind of dare  But then the man has exposed himself falling out of the diaper  And now there's concern his little joke could get a lot more dangerous  You're not sure what people are capable of  But  And  If  If he can  Be that outrageous  And just walk in a diaper  What else could he do?  Well police are not taking this as a joke  They are warning that if they find this guy  He is going to be arrested  Warning like what he didn't know that? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  I thought this was completely legal  Walking in and exposing myself  No shoes  No shirt  No slong  Yes  No rattle  No service  Yeah let's go to Pittsburgh  It's been a while  Pittsburgh  What's up?  Hey  Hey Brock  Yes what's up?  What up?  Oh man  Not much  I'm a horrible father  Why?  Why?  Well  The reason I haven't 
[01:50:30]  I had a kid when I was about 18  And I haven't  Haven't gotten myself some  In a long time  I'm 25  Just a bad father all around  Why are you a bad father?  Well  Why not?  I don't work  Can't support the little  Little guy  Yeah well  But we're looking for guys  That are  Yeah  You're just a dick 
[01:51:00]  Yeah  You really don't deserve anything  Why don't you  Why don't you work?  Why?  Because I'm  Lazy  You should call on Monday  When we do  I'm just a dick  Stories  Mondays we usually do that  Alright I do work  I'm just a liar  Yeah you're a liar  877-212-5762  We're looking for fathers  That think they deserve  A trip to the Bunny Ranch  Nevada  For a date  That guy was trying 
[01:51:30]  For two to three days  And he didn't even understand  He was lying  Right  He didn't understand the concept  What an idiot  No we have much better stories  That have been coming in  All week so  And then Travis  We'll continue taking your stories  Through the break  Okay?  Right  Alright  We're going to do  Vince McMahon or what?  I wanted to keep the show up  We were having fun  And now you're going to  Bring it all down  With the death of Vince McMahon  Well Sam is on top of the story  We'll get to the latest  Still I'm waiting  I haven't seen it  In the Daily News  The Post  None of the national papers 
[01:52:00]  USA Today  CNN  Fox  No one's covering this  Except WWE website  Well you want  Sam  Why wait for the break?  Sam can explain all this  Why?  Now we know that  Vince McMahon  Died in a  In a  Fiery limo explosion  Thank you  It was like a  Like a limo  Car bomb  Thing  Yeah  He got in  It exploded  The fireman put it out  But nobody was found 
[01:52:30]  He could have been incinerated  Completely  He's presumed dead  Presumed dead  Is what it says  The family made a statement  Through a  Spokesperson  Yes  I think  That's the latest  The vice president of  WWE  Some title  Oh  And they  Now  Why haven't the news  Organizations  Jumped on this  I saw the press conference  What I saw  They zoomed back  With the camera  I saw  It set up like a press conference  There were chairs  Not all of them full  There was a spattering 
[01:53:00]  Of people there  And I had never seen  Reporters  With such broad shoulders  Some with shaved heads  Those are Stanford reporters  Oh are they?  Oh okay  Because to me  They looked like wrestlers  Dressed like reporters  If you would ask me  It just looked like  They were a little too big  To be jotting notes down  And they were all sitting  On steroid needles  Which was a little strange  To me  No  For whatever reason  The media  And I really appreciate it 
[01:53:30]  I think it's a good move  In the right direction  Has decided to respect  The privacy of the family  Oh cause that's what  The press does  Ah  So for the first time  In the history of the media  You're telling me  They're actually listening  When the family says  Please respect our privacy  I think it's because  Nobody has been found  And the lead investigator  Of the case  Will be making a statement today  On the WWE website  So  What organization  Is the lead investigator from?  I would assume the FBI  Oh the FBI is involved  But you're still ignoring  The fact that 
[01:54:00]  We did our own investigation  Sam  Yes  And they flew in  A pyro-technic crew  From like L.A.  To Wilkes-Barre  And they blew up the limo  A day before  A day before  Vince actually did it  On live TV  Vince was supposedly  Killed in this  You still don't have  An answer for that  It seems like  Maybe whoever was  Planning this  Might have blown up  A different limo  On Sunday  To throw everybody  Off the hook  Or a test  I would really like 
[01:54:30]  Some names  Are you also attributing  That to sloppy police work?  Yeah very much so  I mean that's why  The FBI is involved now  Not just some  Well you can't have  Local yokels  From Wilkes-Barre  But it was a big story  In Wilkes-Barre  And they were all  Very excited to admit  That yes  They were part of  This whole scam  And blew up the limo  On Sunday  I don't know  What they're telling people  Everybody wants to have  Their name put into  A big news story  Yeah  What about the  Flag at half-mast  That Anthony was  Bringing up today  Yes now  They're in  Stamford, Connecticut  Where their headquarters are 
[01:55:00]  Yeah  They have  Two huge flags out front  One is the American flag  The other is the  WWE flag  With the logo on it  You can see it  When you try to boss it  From New York  All the time  Right off 95  Right  And they said  The flag flying at half-staff  In memory of  Vince McMahon  I noticed only  The WWE flag  Was flying at half-staff  The American flag  Right up at the top  Of the flagpole  Which leads me to believe  If they  If this is indeed  Some type of a scam 
[01:55:30]  They wouldn't fly  The American flag  At half-staff  Because they would take  Massive heat  For disrespecting  The flag  The tradition of half-staff  If he wasn't  Indeed dead  And it was just  A publicity stunt  How do you explain that  Sam?  That's a theory  That some may have  Another theory  Is that anybody  Who knew  Vince McMahon  Would know  That he was  A patriot  First and foremost  And he would not want  He would want that flag  Raised high  Flying high  Yeah  Is the investigation 
[01:56:00]  Focusing on  George the Animal Steel  I hear he had a beef  With Mr. McMahon  There's so many suspects  The WWE website  Reported that  Investigators were  In his office  In Stanford  Yesterday morning  For three hours  Wow  And brought out  Hundreds of boxes  As well as  Personal computers  And even  Tore up the carpet  In the office  Oh my god  This is serious  I guess they're  Remodeling the  Stanford offices  Is that what  You're getting at?  I think it's  Investigative purposes 
[01:56:30]  That's hysterical  They're sitting in a meeting  Yeah I have to  Remodel my office  What are we gonna  Hey we can make  It a storyline  I'm imagining  That Vince McMahon  Is on a fake suspension  Where is he?  Where is he?  Was it vacation time?  What island is he  Hang on?  Come on Vince  Why hasn't the media  Even reported it?  I can see why  They wouldn't bother  The family  Yeah  Why haven't they  Even mentioned  That he could be dead?  There's been a lot  Of big stories  Lately this week  So you think  It just got pushed back?  Yeah it got pushed back  And they said  You know  Maybe we'll let  The other stories  Come to the forefront 
[01:57:00]  We don't want to  Push any buttons  With the wrong people  He's a very powerful man  Well that he is  Yeah  He's a billionaire  Uh huh  Uh huh  He fires people  You know  That's true  And he's made  A lot of enemies  Over the years  So  And why the fake leg?  Why when he  Stepped into the limo  You saw his leg  And then  There was no leg  And then  A fake leg  Popped out  I don't know  There's any documentation  That that was a fake leg  Just so you  The viewer would go  Wow he really  He's gotta be  You know what  It would be tragic  Really tragic  To think of 
[01:57:30]  And I hope  The McMahon family  Doesn't think about this  That he pulled his leg  Into the limo  And then when his leg  Came out  The one that Opie  Calls a fake leg  Yeah  It was Vince  Realizing that  There was a bomb  In the vehicle  And he was trying  To get out  Right when it blew up  So he knew  Beforehand  Then why would he  Close the door  That he was  Maybe  You're not  Flying into this  Crap are you  Maybe he put his foot  Out and said  Oh what if there's a bomb  And then he was like  Well that's a silly idea  And then he put his foot  Back in the second time  And then he  Cut the door  And then it did 
[01:58:00]  Blow up unfortunately  Or how about  Thinking of other people  If that door was open  When the bomb blew up  Perhaps a lot of  Shrapnel would have  Flown out towards  Other people  And Vince being such  A humanitarian  That's a good point  Sacrificed himself  By closing the door  And keeping the blast  Contained  That's another good theory  Yeah  Sure it is  Jimmy Snuka  I just want to see  If I can play  The same game  Sam's playing  Jimmy Snuka  Is one of the  It is fun  Jimmy Snuka  Yeah he made comments  On that Monday night  Raw  Hey brother 
[01:58:30]  Hey  We're going to have to  Play his ID for the show  Oh my god  We get to bring  Dead wrestlers  Rigging a bomb  That guy couldn't  Turn on a flashlight  He's adult  Than you want to add  To Sam's theory  What are you doing  Well I was just  Confirming that  Sam you said  The FBI is investigating this  Yes that's what I've read  Yes is the answer  Okay  Well I just read  That the FBI is  Adamantly saying  They're not at all  In fault with the case  Well  Where was this read though  Where did you read this  The FBI doesn't want 
[01:59:00]  Any part of this  From a related news story  On the internet  Just some internet  Gossip story  Bloggers  They can't get anything done  Just jealous  Yeah  They just want to  Stir the pot  The federal agent  Involved is  Not the FBI  If there is one  I saw a picture of him  On the WWE website  And he looked like  A federal agent  He was  He looked like  If you went to  General casting  You could not have  Picked a better  Federal agent  Than the guy 
[01:59:30]  He's probably one  Of Vince McMahon's  Cousins  You think it is  He keeps it all  In the family  Alright  You're going to  Play the fake  FBI agent  I don't know  If he's fake  Or you're fired  From the McMahon family  Yeah just because  It's a guy in suit  With widow's peak  Does not mean  He's the FBI  Sam  No they said  He's a federal agent  He looks a lot  Like Vince McMahon  Here's what I  Here's what I  Predict  Yeah  Sometime in the future  When Vince McMahon's  Injuries  He's recovered  A bit from them  Or 
[02:00:00]  He's done with his  Vacation  Right  In the Bahamas  There will be  Introduced  A new wrestler  One that is  Masked  In some way  Shape or form  And with gloves  And stuff  So you cannot  See anything  And then  There will be  Years from now  Probably  During the unveiling  You will see  A burnt  And scarred up  Vince McMahon  Under that mask  With his hands  Burnt up  And everything  As he gets  Revenge  On the person  That planted  The bomb  That would be  Wonderful  If it was  True  Here's the 
[02:00:30]  That's what  I'm guessing  Here's the  Great storyline  By the way  It's the first  Storyline  I've actually  Had interest in  In years  Years  Because Vince  Is dead  Unfortunately  Here's the  Statement  That WWE  Made overnight  Oh okay  Very somber  Representative  Good afternoon  I'm Ed Kaufman  Executive Vice  President  And General  Counsel  For World  Wrestling  Entertainment  There's like  You hear one  Kodak  Instamatic  Camera going off  There were  Definitely  Flashes going off  There were flashes

[02:04:00]  Hey, thanks for the support, by the way.  Thank you, Pac.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We're going to take the father's stories, the father's story.  Yeah.  For the trip to the Bunny Ranch out there in Nevada, we've got the girls coming in tomorrow.  The Goyles.  And this woman called, and we were waiting to go to her.  She has a great one, and then she hung up, so hopefully she's still listening out there. 
[02:04:30]  Call us back before we get out of here in ten minutes.  It says, wants to give husband Bunny Ranch trip before she divorces him.  Oh, wow.  I want to know what that's about.  Yeah.  That'd be a good candidate, especially if he's still in love.  I'm wondering if the guy knows that she's going to divorce him, and this is her little thing to do before it goes down.  Maybe he doesn't know, and she does this really nice thing, and then hits him with the divorce when he gets back. 
[02:05:00]  Maybe she thinks he'll take it a little better if he knows there's a little strange out there for him.  It's obviously a great story, but she hung up during the commercial, so hopefully she'll call back.  We got Joe on Long Island.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Joe.  Hi, man.  What's the call?  I got a good story for you.  Yeah.  My mother, I called my father when I was a little kid, not to get too personal.  And since then, my father has let her live in the house.  He sleeps on the couch.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  He's my best friend. 
[02:05:30]  And for 12 years, he hasn't had a woman.  And he's got to look at his ex-wife every single day in the face, in the house.  Wait, so your dad has been letting your mom cheat on him for 15 years?  Basically.  Basically.  The paperwork for the divorce is starting to go through now, but for the last 12 to 15 years,  she's been doing whatever she pleases, and he's been sitting there and allowing it to happen for my sake.  Well, something happened during your call.  Like, we missed why this started. 
[02:06:00]  Like, why would your dad allow this to happen in the first place?  Well, what happened was is that I called her cheating.  I told him, and he just basically, for my sake, wanted everything to stay good in the house,  stay both parents in the house.  How old were you when you called your mom cheating on your dad?  I was like eight.  And what did you see?  And it's not that I saw anything happening.  It's just that, you know, she would be bringing home things from her friend.  And one day she just kind of told me about it, expecting me not to tell my father. 
[02:06:30]  But I tell my father everything.  So I went and I told him right away, told him who it was.  There was a lot of stuff going on.  My father tried to kill the guy.  It was a big thing.  And then your father gave up on your mom but decided to stay in the same house for 15 years?  For my sake.  Now, would he be into going out to the Bunny Ranch?  If you met, when you meet my father, if you meet him, you'll find out.  He is absolutely, that would be his dream. 
[02:07:00]  I say, does he get girls?  Yeah, does he get girls?  Well, he has girls that hit on him, but he's an older guy, so he's not really looking for that right now.  How old is he?  No, he's looking, he's 63.  Oh, wow.  That'd be cool, man.  63.  And how old's your mom?  My mom's 45.  She's a whore.  18 years older.  Yeah.  That's insane.  Who would do that?  He graduated high school. 
[02:07:30]  What?  Joe, can we get you guys in tomorrow?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  I like this guy.  You guys like this guy?  Yeah, it sounds like a good story.  We've got to give Bear some competition.  I like this one.  All right, Joe, hold on the line.  We'll give you all the info on how to get in here tomorrow.  All right.  All right, cool.  Let's say hi to Tracy in Syracuse.  Tracy.  Hey, so here's your competition.  Yeah.  All right.  My dad's first wife and baby got killed in a car accident.  Oh, Jesus.  You can't just start there. 
[02:08:00]  That's terrific.  That's funny?  Oh, my God.  That's terrific.  Well, it's your delivery.  You've just delivered that like you're given the five-day forecast.  Wow.  Well, no, no.  I don't know a huge, long thing about it.  Okay.  It's not that it's funny.  Well, kind of like the car.  Kind of like the car.  You didn't slow down.  It's not that it's not.  I'm from California.  Talk fast.  Hold on.  It's not that we think it's funny.  Exactly.  Start again.  Go slow.  Yeah.  Tell us exactly what happened.  All right.  Well, in like 1962, my dad's first wife and baby were killed by a drunk driver. 
[02:08:30]  What?  No.  Anyways.  Okay.  So then.  Hold on.  Anthony.  What do you got in?  What's up?  No.  I was just trying to soak that in.  It was 1962.  Ed missed something as far as the story goes.  He was looking on the internet about the Vince McMahon thing, doing a little more research.  How did it happen? 
[02:09:00]  Like, what were the circumstances?  My dad was with his wife and baby.  The baby was in his wife's lap.  Oh, before car seats.  In Texas.  Yeah.  The baby got crushed.  My dad wasn't wearing a seatbelt and got shoved underneath the steering wheel.  Oh!  And had, well, he had to lift his dead son out the window to the fire department.  Uh, excuse me.  Buzzkill?  Wow.  Right.  No, no, no.  Okay.  Bit of a buzzkill. 
[02:09:30]  He's, he raised me.  I want to bring Tom Chiasano in to cheer up the mood in here now.  Either that or Club Soda County.  We need both of them to cheer up this place.  Jeez.  Hello?  Hello, Buzzkill?  We got people going to work?  I know, no.  Okay.  I got more.  Okay.  All right.  Continue.  My mom left us when we were, when I was seven.  My dad raised me as my best, my best friend.  Wait, wait.  Your dad raised you?  Hold on.  What happened with your mom?  Oh, she said that electrical engineers were white trash and married a plastic surgeon. 
[02:10:00]  So she abandoned you and your father?  Yes.  Yeah, she did.  She did.  He's always been there for everybody.  Uh, he made me up for a couple of years, too.  Ah, did you see that jerk?  Ah, did you see that jerk?  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  So that was his second wife, I guess, right?  Well, okay.  And then in junior high, I had a friend that lived in, like, the most terrible conditions, 
[02:10:30]  and I asked her, I asked my dad if she could move in, and so she moved in, and my dad took  her as his own.  Um, I'm a graphic designer, and I have been, you know, starting my own business.  Took her as his own?  He was supporting me through that.  What does that mean?  Um, what?  What does took her as his own mean?  Oh, as his own child.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  You got me scared there.  Sorry.  I thought maybe, uh, yeah. 
[02:11:00]  I forgot who I was talking to.  So now, now, you kind of have an adopted sister, almost.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  And she is living a great life compared to her other sisters who followed the same path  as her parents.  And what does that mean?  What happened to them?  Oh, they have, like, ten kids and live on welfare, that sort of thing.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Hee.  Yeah.  She supports herself.  No, he's, he's the most awesome person.  He's always been there for everybody. 
[02:11:30]  I couldn't even tell you how many people have asked me if he would adopt them.  Really?  He's the best person in the world.  But why the bunny ranch?  What are you thinking?  My dad, the perv.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he would love it.  Oh, my gosh.  How do you know he's a perv?  Because I catch him looking down girls' shirts all the time.  The ones that want to be adopted?  Well, cleavage is in this season.  So, you know, you can't blame the guy. 
[02:12:00]  How's your mom doing now?  Is she doing well or did things fall apart for her?  No, she's still spending all her husband's money.  Yeah.  Yeah, not sharing it with anybody.  And how's your dad doing?  Does he work still?  Yeah, he's retired now, but he works for the GED.  He actually lives in Texas.  Is he lonely?  Yes, he's very lonely.  He didn't want me to move out here.  I stayed with him for a year before I moved out here.  He's so not funny. 
[02:12:30]  No.  No, of course not.  So, that's Nathaniel.  He's just a clown.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  I think you should apologize to this woman.  Yes.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  I should call my dad and apologize to him.  Well, you know what?  I think that it was...  I think Anthony owes you an apology.  I'm sorry I did that.  Oh, I'm embarrassed that I did that.  I know.  I understand.  I made an ass of myself.  It's giving you the apology tour here.  Will you shut up? 
[02:13:00]  Oh, my God.  It's funny because I don't know you.  Let's just keep it that way.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  So, your dad...  Now, but what do you...  Did your dad do well with ladies?  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Well...  Well, then why would we send him to the Bunny Ranch?  Yeah, we need...  Pathetic souls.  Well, no.  He does well with ladies.  The story's pathetic, but...  He hasn't dated since I was in high school.  I'm 32, and I'm sure he hasn't had sex since then, either.  Hmm.  So, like, early 90s, maybe? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, maybe.  So, and, you know, he is very lonely, and he's the best dad in the whole...  You're a liar!  Unfortunately, he's in Texas, though.  Where do you live?  Like, we need...  Well, we're going to give a...  I think we're going to give a spot away if it's okay with the rules committee.  We'll have one of these followers on the phone tomorrow, because we're broadcasting all over the country.  All right.  All right, Tracy, you know what?  Why don't we...  You think he could keep his story a bit fun?  Because we're trying to make people happy in the morning. 
[02:14:00]  Fun.  Well, I'm just trying to explain what a good father is and what he's been through.  Maybe he's handing dead loved ones out of the window.  How do you make that fun?  What exactly...  I don't know, but, you know...  What exactly happened, like...  No, no, you could talk about it, because what really happened.  But, I mean, like, what exactly...  Was it his fault?  Was it the other driver's fault?  What exactly was it?  It was a drunk driver that hit them.  Drinking was legal.  Drinking and driving was legal.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  The guy got off.  Sometimes I'm a bad boy, yeah.  Yeah.  What happened to that guy?  That douche.  All right, listen.  He really did rule.  Tracy.  Does anybody remember laughter?  Yeah, really, man.  It can't be a buzzkill.  People count on us every morning to kind of make them happy going to work.  And your story, quite frankly, is a downer.  You wouldn't be here if that didn't all happen, right?  Yep.  Exactly.  I kind of have a little survivor's guilt because of it, even though it was way before I was born. 
[02:15:00]  How does that feel?  You would have ended up on the armrest in an Edsel.  Wait, what?  Wait, that's the only reason you're alive, right?  What?  He had to go through that.  Yes, yes.  That's the only reason why I'm alive.  He had to go through that.  You know what?  One of these days in the near future, if this girl will shut up, I'll set up a nice bid for everybody.  One of these days, we're going to have to take your stories, Why I'm Here.  The Why I'm Here stories.  I already know why I'm here.  A little known fact about the opster, my dad's first wife that he loved dearly, died at 26 years old, of a rare liver thing or kidney thing. 
[02:15:30]  That's the only reason I'm here.  Really?  Yeah, how to lose his high school sweetheart, basically.  Yeah.  That's the only reason I'm here.  We should take those stories.  Kind of makes you look at death a little differently, right, Tracy?  Yep, definitely.  Do you ever feel bad about it?  So you're saying...  Absolutely not.  You're saying if that didn't happen, you wouldn't be here?  Oh, yeah.  Don't give me the crap I'd be here in another way story that I hear. 
[02:16:00]  What happened to her?  I was born somebody else in a different family.  Oh, if this lady...  It's not about you.  And were there any kids from that?  And what happened to her?  My dad actually had a tragic, tragic life before me.  Hey, fair is fair.  My dad's had a tragic life.  No, my dad lost two sons.  Kind of like that crib death thing.  Thank you, Anthony. 
[02:16:30]  Payback's going to be a bitch.  And then his wife, at 26, died of kidney disease.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  And that's the reason I'm here.  And that's the reason my five brothers and sister are here.  Mom!  Mom!  I am, uh...  You're feeling awkward?  No, not at all.  My story is just less dramatic.  I'm here because of a fifth of whiskey and too long to walk home to say no. 
[02:17:00]  All right, Tracy, hold on a line.  We're going to try to get you involved tomorrow.  Okay.  All right?  All right, thanks.  All right.  But tell him to kind of, like, lighten his story a little bit and get some jokes in there  somehow.  Jokes?  Jokes?  Yeah, I'll tell you that to make, tell me one, an amusing anecdote to describe what  happened.  A fun analogy.  Yeah.  All right, Tracy, hold on to the line, okay?  All right.  Yeah, tomorrow's the Father's Day giveaway.  I'm here because of the New York City...  You know what?  Tomorrow. 
[02:17:30]  Whose is this?  All right.  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow we do this bit.  Why?  Iraq's got one?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  We'll give it now.  But everyone has to tell us why they're here on this earth.  Including the listeners.  Eric, and I mean as a radio person.  In the building.  Go ahead.  Iraq is here.  Why?  Because of the blackout of 1977.  Is that what your mom refers to it as?  She was drunk?  All right.  The vibrator wouldn't work. 
[02:18:00]  Dad had to...  Blackout of 77.  Explain.  Summer of 77, power went out, and pretty much that's the only reason I'm here.  That was the only way your dad could have sex with your mom?  All the lights are off?  What are you getting at?  No.  Weren't they having sex before the blackout?  I'm sure they were, but that was pretty much the reason I'm here.  No, I know what it was.  He was already born, and he was such a disappointment they were going to drown him.  But then the blackout, like, diverted their attention, and they forgot.  And then sweet Eric brought them a candle, and they're like, all right, we'll let him. 
[02:18:30]  Eric ate all the food in the fridge before it went bad.  He was in the bathtub, and they were just about to throw the toaster in the bathtub, and all the lights went off.  Oh, man.  The power went out, right?  That's what caused the blackout.  Right.  The short circuit.  A little hawk.  See you soon.  Oh, that's adorable.  So they were bored.  There was no TV.  There was nothing to do.  And you were one of those babies born of the blackouts.  Yeah, that happened in the late 60s also. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  We got to wrap up.  That's a weird thing that happened in a blackout, right?  For your parents to go, well, there's nothing else to do.  Well, let's just have some.  Let's create the opry.  Thank you.  Take the wig.  You enjoyed my absolutely not comment.  It was in there.  I hear it.  It was in the pile of chatter.  Keith in Connecticut, real fast, because I know Tom wants to come through that door,  but after we talked about how he's.  We're having a fun show. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  All right, Tom, I promise.  One last call.  We're really on a roll here.  Keith, go ahead.  By the way, Travis is going to stay late today to take more of your stories,  because we have a few more spots for the big giveaway tomorrow,  so you can still call 877-212-5762.  Tell Travis your story about your dad,  and we're going to invite a bunch of fathers in tomorrow,  and we're going to give away that trip to the bunny ranch.  But, Keith, you've got to make it fast, because they really want us out of here.  Maybe Tom will let us go today.  Yeah.  Make it fast.  Hey, thanks a lot.  Too bad a buzzkill girl didn't come with a mute button,  but my story is I've been married seven years, 
[02:20:00]  and since my son was born, my wife won't really have sex with me.  There's no touching, no looking, no missionary position,  and prior to our son being born, it was anything goes.  She was really kinky and really wild before the sun?  Oh, yeah, anything.  Watching porn through three imports, and now there's nothing going on.  Nothing.  Wow.  And would she allow you to take this trip to the bunny ranch?  I don't see why not.  That sounds convincing.  You really rule with an iron.  What do you think?  Should we just throw him in the mix?  Iron limp wrist. 
[02:20:30]  Should we throw him in the mix?  Yeah, why not?  All right, you know, we'll give you a shot tomorrow, Keith.  Hold on the line, okay?  All right, thanks.  There goes Keith.  His wife stopped being kinky after the birth of their son.  We're going to continue your stories, even though we're going off the air.  Travis will take some phone calls for the next, like, ten minutes, okay?  And then tomorrow's the big giveaway.  One lucky father for Father's Day gets a trip to the bunny ranch in Nevada for a date.  I don't know who this guy on the Greg show is, but I want to throw warm ass in his face. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, I hate that guy.  He's wearing sneakers.  Just a fun guy.  I don't know if I've ever hated anyone on site more than him.  I'm not a big fan.  Okay.  Anything else, Ant?  You good?  No, I'm good.  Have a pleasant rest of the morning and afternoon.  Jimmy, you good?  I can't get over it.  This guy's a parody of a douche.  He couldn't be a real person.  This is a caricature.  Oh, the Greg show?  Yeah, we got to talk about him a little bit.  Yeah, we got to.  I've never hated anyone on site faster. 
[02:21:30]  He's got a mullet.  He's awful.  I'm sneaker, and he's wacky.  I would bet a lot of money he's an old radio guy.  Has that look.  Yeah.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Tomorrow, big show.  And then, of course, Jones Beach Saturday for everybody in the New York area.  Tickets still available for the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Shoe with ONA Village.  And now it's an official tailgating party, thanks to Tom.  Sponsored and everything.  It's going to be an all-day event.  You can still get your tickets through Ticketmaster.com.
