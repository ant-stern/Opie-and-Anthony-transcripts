<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them with frequent use of vulgar and offensive language.  The show began with the hosts—Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton—discussing their return from a five-day break.  They recounted their experiences, including a band reunion at a bar called the Downtown, and lamented the return to their demanding work schedule.  Norton's personal life, particularly his sexual exploits during the break, were discussed extensively, interwoven with sexually explicit jokes about hookers and massages.  The conversation then veered towards Black Friday shopping, with the hosts employing highly critical and offensive language to describe the shoppers' behavior, recounting anecdotes of pepper spray incidents and stampedes.  They also discussed a news story about a man jumping from the Empire State Building, and touched upon the monotony of holiday traditions like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Norton’s upcoming variety hour, featuring his music selections, was briefly mentioned.  Listener calls, reflecting similar themes of Black Friday experiences, the variety hour, and offensive anecdotes, punctuated this section. The segment concluded with the song "Get Your Cock Out" and further sexually explicit banter.

The next segment started with a discussion of a creepy radio advertisement for Dr. Gil Liedemann, focusing on various cancers and accompanied by depressing music.  This led to a discussion of "cancer music" in film and television, referencing a scene from *ER*.  The conversation then shifted to Kirstie Alley's weight and her publicized lack of sex life, referencing tabloid covers. Callers offered their opinions on overweight women and the hosts discussed a shipment of large plastic testicles intended as car ornaments, prompting further vulgar jokes. A caller shared a story about a disappointing sexual encounter due to a woman's unexpected weight after removing her girdle, sparking a discussion of "fat sex." They revisited the story of Dr. Gil Liedemann and his controversial actions, including a judge's unusual response to a lawsuit—writing a song parody in court. Opie recounted a disappointing meeting with a woman he met on a CB radio, whose appearance differed significantly from his expectations.

The following segment opened with vulgar jokes about the hosts' mothers and sexually explicit humor regarding differences in male and female energy levels after sex.  Listener-submitted audio clips were featured prominently, including a looping recording of a man in a psychiatric hospital repeatedly saying, "Nothing works here. The medications don't work. I hate this place. I've been here for seven years," and an unintelligible "quickie."  A caller explained the origin of plastic bull testicles hung from livestock trailers, leading to further vulgar jokes.  Club Soda Kenny, a recurring guest, called in to discuss his appearance on HBO's "Inside the NFL," and audio clips were played.  His theme song was briefly discussed. Several truckers called in with humorous and sexually explicit stories.  A significant portion focused on Jim Norton's announced (though seemingly ambivalent) quitting of Craigslist hookers, exploring his spending habits and his desire for genuine connection.  A news story about Neil Diamond's sister seeking a kidney donor via Craigslist led to a discussion about the illegal kidney trade.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Norton's sex life and his reluctance to commit to relationships.

A later segment began with a listener call, followed by a discussion of old show segments, including the song "Ding Fries Are Done," described as featuring a "retard singing."  The hosts reminisced about their post-cancellation feelings and compared commercial and satellite radio, mentioning John Montone's repetitive news stories.  They discussed their involvement in a charity event, "Hungry-thon," including the incident where a priest stormed out after witnessing a double dildo sex show during a live auction, and Stalker Patty's first appearance. A caller recounted picking up the remains of a man who fell from an airplane.  "Ding Fries Are Done" was played again. The conversation shifted to a New York Post column, "Just Asking," prompting speculation about celebrities, including Bruce Willis, J.K. Rowling, Candace Bushnell, and Nicolas Cage.  A listener called to comment on aging action heroes.  The hosts discussed a Cindy Adams sex column and further speculated about the celebrities.  They then interviewed Bart King, author of "The Big Book of Boy Stuff," reading excerpts from the book, interrupted by technical difficulties.  The segment concluded with sexually suggestive comments.

The final segment opened with XM Satellite Radio advertisements.  The hosts engaged in banter, including a humorous bit about hardened oatmeal.  A caller, Steve, discussed seeing "Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason," leading to homophobic slurs and crude comments about the film and Renee Zellwegger.  They read a Harriet Cole advice column, offering cynical commentary on male-female friendships.  Norton recounted a fabricated story about catching a female friend engaging in oral sex.  This transitioned to the "Monster Rain" song submissions, with two songs played—one by DJ New Style and a Christmas-themed one by Chaz—both containing graphic and sexually explicit lyrics. A "What Did We Learn?" segment followed, with callers sharing their takeaways. The final caller's comments led to a bit about a whale-watching trip, followed by comments about banking fees, and concluding with more XM Radio advertisements.

[00:06:30]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:07:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  You don't go to CNN for dick jokes.  Don't come to ONA for hard-hitting news.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony.  I love Opie and Anthony. 
[00:07:30]  Opie's great.  Great.  I don't know.  Your mom's box.  Opie and Anthony show.  Way stink.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tics.  I'll bet.  Yeah.  Sexist and racist.  Wow.  Two in one.  You have a gift.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Stay out of the bushes. 
[00:08:00]  I know a lot about golf.  I know even more about Graham.  He's a black guy.  Ooh, fun.  It was all because of this terrible, awful Negro.  You're getting eclectic today.  A little bit.  I'm just checking out what's on some of these things myself.  All right.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hello. 
[00:08:30]  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've been gone for five days.  Oh, my God.  I don't think anyone wants to be here today.  Oh, not true.  No, we love.  We're very excited.  We love our jobs, don't we?  Yes, we do.  My God.  I feel like I've been on vacation for a week.  I love my job.  I don't love my getting up.  I had to get back into it.  How long did it take you?  Like, I got to start thinking about it. 
[00:09:00]  We were off from Wednesday.  Wednesday.  So I had to start thinking about it on Friday.  Like, all right, what do I got to do to arrange my life?  So I don't screw this up and can wake up on time on Monday.  Awful.  It is awful.  I stayed up last night.  I couldn't sleep.  Is that what you did?  Three in the afternoon.  I got up every day and then I have to go to bed last night.  It can't happen.  So you haven't slept yet?  No.  See?  When was the last time you slept?  I got up yesterday afternoon at three.  It's going to take me a day and a half or two days to get my schedule back.  It's just such a mess. 
[00:09:30]  It really stinks.  Yeah, because we get four or five days where we can live like normal human beings.  But I'm waking up every morning at five, six, trying to get back to sleep.  My body's trying to wake me up.  I'm like, no, you don't have to get up today.  You know, sleep in.  Oh, I felt like the old days at the downtown.  I was having some beers.  It was late.  Yeah.  I was out.  I was conscious.  And then you get back to Monday.  It's like, oh, back to bed, poopsie.  I've got to get up early.  I know.  Oh, it's nine o'clock.  Tuck me in. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, you just feel like I'm seven years old again.  I was out to dinner last night, and it's eight o'clock, and the restaurant is just starting  to fill in.  And I'm looking around going, are these people insane?  Why are they eating so late?  Don't they know it's like the middle of the night?  You've got to go to sleep.  You're going to get heartburned.  Exactly, man.  What the F?  You've got to go to Betty Bar.  Hey, yeah, we've got to thank everyone that went to the downtown on Wednesday night.  That was a lot of fun.  That was fun.  It was Aunt Nye and Brother Joe doing his tribute band's journey and U2, and then your old band 
[00:10:30]  took the stage.  That's right.  Took the stage.  Took the stage for the first time in like five years.  Five.  It was longer than that.  Well, maybe, yeah, for the quick thing we did in Asbury Park, I guess.  Yeah.  But as a band where we rehearsed, it was probably 10 years since we've actually done anything.  You guys got rave reviews.  It was fun.  On all the message boards saying, hey, man, they pulled it off considering they haven't  played in a while.  It was fun.  I forgot all the words to one song. 
[00:11:00]  And then the rest was, you know.  Wasn't that one song your big hit?  That was our big hit.  Primal side?  I couldn't remember any words.  It was primal side, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Couldn't remember.  Oh, I remember the chorus.  That was about it.  Yeah.  And then we did a lot of chili pepper stuff.  Yeah, it was a good time.  Which was always fun.  So we had a good time.  Like I said, it was nice to just be out with people that are out at night.  Mm-hmm.  Not in the house.  Not worrying about going to sleep.  I had like four days to recover.  Yeah, it was crazy. 
[00:11:30]  I was wondering why Jimmy was in so early.  You just stayed up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I wanted to get a few movie drops recorded.  And I'm like, well, I've been sitting here like a caged animal all night.  Let's just get in the studio and work, work, work.  This is, I think.  What are we up to?  This is our eighth week at XM Satellite Radio.  Somebody lost count.  I think I might have lost count, too.  Ninth week we're starting.  This is the ninth week?  We've done 40 shows?  I don't know.  We've done 40 days at XM Radio?  I think so.  Remember, you said 35, and then we had three more.  All right, so we did 40.  So this is our 39th show.  Well, no, we count the replays. 
[00:12:00]  Okay.  Yeah, why not?  All right.  Because it was new for somebody.  So, yeah, we've done 40 shows in this new time slot, 6 to 10.  And Anthony and I are here between 4.45 and 5, no later usually.  And Jim usually strolls in about 6.02.  Just as the good, the bad, and the ugly is ending.  And the thing is, I'm like, hi, boys, pulling my throat off.  Hey, how you doing?  Right.  I don't need to be here early.  Yeah, as we're trying to, like, figure out what to do today and get the show together within an hour, you just kind of stroll in at 6. 
[00:12:30]  Dude, I know I'm worthless.  My fingers still smell like tranny.  You did not, did you?  No.  No.  No.  How many different girls were you with since Wednesday?  It might have been one or two.  Not many, man, if any.  Not many.  I love that.  Dude, I'm done whoring.  I'm done with it.  No.  Stop.  I've heard you say that before.  Are you sure?  What's different about this one?  I don't know.  I just don't want to do it anymore.  He doesn't want to do it anymore.  I'm sick of spending the money.  They never call me.  I swear to God, I expect them to call me sometimes. 
[00:13:00]  You do.  How you been?  How you been?  What, the hookers that you pick up?  You expect them to call you?  No, the ones I write checks to.  Some of them I write checks to.  And one girl who I've actually hooked up with a couple times.  We've never had sex.  But I wrote a check, and she lost it, and I have to reissue it.  You know how awful that is to have to rewrite a check?  Are you kidding to a hooker?  No, she's not.  She's not a hooker.  I've never slept with her.  Wait.  Well, what did she do for you?  A massage.  Just a regular massage, you know?  With the Yankee Cranky?  That's a regular massage, yeah.  No, it's not. 
[00:13:30]  Of course it is.  That's a hooker.  No.  That's more than a regular massage.  Oh, you silly geese.  I actually go to a regular massage therapist from time to time.  I'm not getting the happy endings.  That's a regular massage.  Why would you do that?  Definition.  Why?  It's relaxing.  I don't know.  That would be funny to send you into a regular masseuse.  Yeah.  Have them get the massage and go, hey, what are you forgetting here?  Come on.  At the end, it's like, what a waste that was.  I went to one in Jersey when I still lived there.  Of course, it was an Asian place.  It was open at like 3 in the morning.  So I go in, and she leaves the door open, and she actually covers me with a towel, and she gives 
[00:14:00]  me shiatsu, and I wanted to cut her throat.  What are you doing, you war criminal?  Get your fingers out of my back.  It was agonizing.  Some people, you know, they like the regular massage with the candles and the catarro in  the background, you know.  That's nice.  It's all nice.  It leads up to something.  It's relaxing.  It relieves stress.  Not some alien expressionless face just digging her rotten Western civilization,  handing fingers into your spine.  Creepy bitch. 
[00:14:30]  So you got here at 5.10 this morning.  I walk in, I'm like, what the hell are you doing here?  Yeah, it was just coming to program that hour of music.  Our first hour of music, you've agreed to let me do one of these days, and I'm going  to put a couple of little movie drops in there along with the songs.  He's working.  That's cool.  Not one.  You should do it from time to time, man.  Okay.  I mean, I don't want to, you know.  Yeah.  And then, you know, because we do have this channel, High Voltage, we're going to start  programming it the right way.  Like, we're going to give Rich Voss a couple hours to talk about crap and other things.  Maybe even open up a few hours to the listeners to have them just completely take over. 
[00:15:00]  We're developing all sorts of little...  Now you're going crazy.  Well, now it's like, I think we've hit the next stage of this whole experiment.  Sure.  That's also called the biggest comeback in radio history, hopefully.  We're trying.  Oh, are we trying?  What a pain in the ass this is, but so far so good.  I had my lovely Thanksgiving with the family, and the one thing I have to answer all the  time is, is that Jim Norton for real?  Yeah. 
[00:15:30]  Like, the things he does, is that real?  Is he really doing that?  I'm so tired of answering that one.  Of course.  I met Anthony's mom again, and she's such a nice lady, and she's like, that's not real  what you say, is it?  I'm like, no, no, no.  No, it's a bit.  She's hoping against hope.  Yeah, I'm like, no, I'm just being silly.  She can't imagine that someone's so nice, because Jimmy's very nice.  That's what everyone says to me, too.  They cannot believe it.  They expect him to come up and, you know, pinch her ass or something. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Grab her crotch and go, how you doing, lady?  Right.  You know?  Try to pick her up like a bowling ball.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he's a nice guy.  He comes up.  He's very respectful.  He's very nice.  Yeah.  And it just throws people off when they listen to this program and hear the horror things.  They really don't want to believe that you're like that.  They don't want to believe it.  They don't want to believe it at all.  And I don't do the lie thing.  I'm just like, yes, everything he says is the truth.  He's a disgusting, horrid human being.  Thanksgiving was good, though?  Yeah, it's one of those, you know. 
[00:16:30]  Same old shit every year, isn't it?  Every year.  It really is.  I sit in the same seat.  I sit in the same seat.  It's like, didn't I, I was, what, didn't we do this yesterday?  Like, I go to the same house, sit in the same seat, have the same food, have the same  arguments, have the same discussions.  It's the same stuff.  I sit in the same seat I sat in since I was, like, maybe seven years old.  And the people, our family's in a transitional state where, like, the kids aren't kids anymore.  They're young adults. 
[00:17:00]  So they're like, you know, 18 and 17 and stuff.  So they don't even want to be there anymore.  They just want to listen to their Eminem CDs and go out back and smoke.  The older ones are, like, getting too old now.  So it's not, like, fun.  And it's, like, this whole transitional thing where maybe the younger people have to get older  and start their whole new thing because this one's just, it's, like, getting depressing  is what it is, you know?  Mm-hmm.  Like, enough.  I don't drink as much as I used to, which I guess made it better in the old days. 
[00:17:30]  I would just pound down a bunch of Captain Morgans and Coke and laugh along.  It would numb the pain.  Laugh along at my deteriorating family.  I was like, ah, she's got to sit there.  Yeah.  I think we need new holidays or something.  You think?  Yeah, it's the same old crap every year.  And now it's the same old crap with Christmas right around the corner.  Are you looking forward to Christmas this year?  No.  Oh, I got to look at my grandma. 
[00:18:00]  She's got the walker now with the tennis balls on the front.  Tennis balls?  You know, you haven't seen the walker with the tennis balls?  I mean, I might even not know it.  Now they got to put the tennis balls on the walker so they don't, I don't know what that's  for.  Does it wear down the little rubber things that come with its stock?  Well, so I guess.  Is it like hopping up your walker with the tennis balls?  Wait, is that so they don't scrape the wall or something when they hit it?  I think so.  Oh, is that so they don't scrape the wall?  Yeah, it's all those kids out there that have the nice homes and you got your mom and you 
[00:18:30]  don't want her scratching up your nice wood floor.  You're putting this racing stripe on your wall.  So you place the tennis balls on the bottom of the walker.  I like the walkers with the wheels and the handbrakes.  Yeah, the handbrakes.  Just in case grandma gets doing about 60, she can put the brakes on.  Dude, you know the deal.  If it ever comes down to me in a walker with handbrakes, you know what you have to do,  right, I have to drive by, high caliber weapon, and shoot you in the back of the head.  Back of the head.  Yep.  So you don't see it coming.  I don't even want to see it coming, but make sure you take care of the job. 
[00:19:00]  Sitting there, a little glimmer in your eye, waxing fantastic about the old days, and  then just out of nowhere, blam!  Gone.  Yeah.  I was Spuds Buckley once.  Shut up!  There I was.  I remember the old days.  It was the Opie and...  Opie and...  What was his name?  Gosh, it was so long ago. 
[00:19:30]  Now I sit here on my little rascal if I want to go into the kitchen,  but if I'm just moseying about the living room, I use my walker.  You know, the tennis...  Maybe I have to go down here and change the tennis...  Wow!  Blam!  Nice.  You get that, and then the bag of potatoes sound when you hit the floor.  Just down, gone.  The trickle starts out of your head. 
[00:20:00]  And there's a little squish when you hit the ground because of the loaded diaper.  And you've been lugging around all afternoon, you old burden.  You old burden.  Oh, God.  And then right after Thanksgiving was Black Friday, everybody.  Black Friday.  Oh, did you participate in all the shopping that went on?  I participated in watching TV, looking at how ridiculous everybody was.  They interviewed so many people at malls going,  I thought I'd be the only one waking up at 4 in the morning. 
[00:20:30]  Well, I'm here.  I thought I'd be here first, but the line was around the corner when I got here at 5.30.  I'm here for the bargains.  Oh, shut up.  Oh, they get them, and they're so happy that they're on lines that if I was on...  When I go to a store, if there's two people in front of me on the line,  I start getting a little nervous.  I get, like, where I'm doing that craning my neck thing,  looking like, all right, why aren't they moving? 
[00:21:00]  Is there a problem at the register?  Do they have to find a manager?  I hate their freaking window.  We need someone at 5 from Housewares.  We need someone at 5 from Housewares.  Then you stand there, you're like, all right, Housewares,  maybe the guy will be coming up.  5 Housewares, please.  And they're just standing there making that face at each other, like,  well, and the guy might turn around and look at the line, like, well, it happens. 
[00:21:30]  And I'm like, I go crazy.  And I start looking at other lines and watch them.  They're conga lining up, swiping the card.  There's smoke coming off the thing because of the friction from all the cards being swiped  and the speed at which they're, and then you know what happens.  You decide to switch lines.  Oh, when you switch 5?  Hi, I'm Bob from Housewares.  Let me press that one button and solve the whole problem.  Yeah.  What?  What?  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. 
[00:22:00]  Now they're going through, and then I'm on the line.  We need Bill, Bill, Bill from Toys.  Bill from Toys.  Problem at register 4.  You can tell it's register 4 because now the asswipe from 5 is on and 4.  He's waiting here, ready to shoot everybody.  Drives me nuts, these two people.  But they were waiting.  These people go to the malls for, maybe to save, what, 10 bucks?  Maybe.  Maybe.  I saw a line around the corner for Target. 
[00:22:30]  I'm like, what is going on in Target that you need to be on a line just to get in the store?  Around the corner.  They were around the corner waiting for those doors to fling open.  And they rush in to this pile of, you know, no-name DVDs that are in the middle of the floor grabbing them.  And in some cases, punching, kicking, rioting.  Well, because that is the Christmas spirit.  It truly is the Christmas spirit.  People feel they have to go to these things and be part of it. 
[00:23:00]  Is that what it is?  Because I can't understand why you can't go, maybe, today.  Yeah, go today.  You get the same shit for the same price.  Yeah, it's probably the sales are continuing, right?  Of course.  First of all, there are no real sales.  It's all a big lie.  They jack the price up and then say you're getting 20% off.  Everyone knows this.  It's nothing new.  That's what they do.  So you're going to get the same price you got on that, what do they call it, Black Friday. 
[00:23:30]  Black Friday.  That's all the, uh, when Black Friday comes.  All the retail stores get rid of their red ink on that day is what they say.  Ha ha.  Black Friday.  And they go in there and get these, they think they're getting a bargain for standing on a line.  And the register lines, the lines outside the place, like I said, crazy.  Somebody had the good sense to set off some pepper spray in Toys R Us here in Times Square, though.  Did they really?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Evacuated the store and everything. 
[00:24:00]  Just cops down there, helicopters.  It was insane.  And then they were pissed off at Toys R Us because after they cleared it out and vented it, it was hours later, the place was empty.  So they kind of really lost out, man.  When it's your big day and you lose out like that, good.  I'm sure Christmas was a good idea maybe a long time ago.  But now, in this day and age, it's just become one big pain in the ass.  It is a pain in the ass.  And now it's a pain in the ass from Thanksgiving right up until Christmas.  It's the pressure, the nerves, now you've got to get stuff. 
[00:24:30]  We were having a discussion, the family getting together, having a discussion last year about not doing it.  We do it every year.  Everyone gets gifts for everybody.  And we were going to do this new thing where you pick one person, kind of the grab bag thing.  You haven't done the grab bag thing yet?  No.  I have to get for everyone and everyone else has to get for everyone.  It's crazy.  It's senseless.  It's stupid. 
[00:25:00]  And now we want to do this.  But the discussion didn't come up this year.  And I voted against it last year because I'm a nostalgic guy.  I like the tradition.  I kind of get like, no, I want it to be like it was.  Are you kidding?  Yeah.  I'm stupid like that.  I mean, no.  I'm stupid like that.  I'm learning something new about you.  You're the rich one.  You're the one they all look forward to getting the gifts from.  I know.  But I was like, no, I kind of want to keep it.  But then I was like, okay, if the discussion comes up this year, I am absolutely voting for the one gift grab bag type thing. 
[00:25:30]  And then it never came up.  So now I don't know what to do.  They'll all be fighting.  They're all going to want the one who gets Anthony.  They'll want me.  I'll trade you $2,000 to Joe for Anthony.  It never came up because they know you're going to give the good gifts.  I've seen you give gifts.  Yes.  I get the Christmas spirit in me.  And I have the spirit of giving, Opie.  Yes, you do.  It's what Christmas is about.  Oh, I hate it.  But gift cards are big time in now. 
[00:26:00]  See, now everyone just runs around the stores and gets gift cards for everybody.  So you're not really personalizing your gift anymore.  I feel like I can't do that.  At this point, it's really a waste of time.  You should just be able to look at your family members and go, look, it's a wash, right?  You're going to get me a GAP certificate.  I'm going to get you a certificate for Best Buy.  It's a wash.  Yeah, it is.  It's like, what was that, Johnny Brasco?  Is that for Christmas?  They came in and gave each other a $100 bill or something.  Hey, thank you, thank you.  Donnie Brasco.  Did you say Johnny Brasco?  I did.  I think he did say Johnny. 
[00:26:30]  Who's that?  My favorite movie was Donnie Mnemonic.  Yes, Donnie Brasco.  Johnny Brasco.  Jesus.  I love when Greg Brady played Donnie Bravo.  What an ass you are for pointing that out.  I just thought I heard him.  I hate it.  I know.  Who?  He's got that smile like, you're fucked up.  I hate that.  You got to look at him.  I know.  He goes, you're fucked up.  I'm always in show where.  And he can't wait to tell you. 
[00:27:00]  At least I recovered.  You're awful.  Oh, now I'm all hot.  I'm nervous.  Quick, quick.  Hey, let's relax.  Put on a John Henley song.  I want to hear Donnie be good.  Shut up.  Hey, not to interrupt.  Why don't we go down to D.C.?  Because I want to see John and Mike.  You stink.  One more thing about Black Friday.  Did you guys see what happened in Alabama?  They got trampled as they were opening up the store, the doors to the mall. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, good.  And these fat fucks from Alabama were getting trampled because they were all trying to get  their free Walkman or something like that.  Was it a Walkman?  Really?  In the year 2004.  Yeah.  It's brand new for us down here.  Jesus.  And they trample each other.  Well, the whole way they set it up is a recipe for disaster.  They line all these rooms up at the door, whip them up into a froth like there's going  to be some huge sale that they're never, ever going to be able to get anywhere else. 
[00:28:00]  And then they fling the doors open all at once and let them all gallop in.  Good.  To one area where this big thing is on sale.  Whatever the giveaway is.  Good.  All right.  Calm down.  It wasn't that funny.  What?  You're still breathing heavy over there.  No, no.  I've actually congested him.  He loves it.  He loves when someone bobbles the ball.  I was actually thinking of just the sea of fat chicks running in.  Oh.  It was really funny to see.  And they're falling down and other people are running over them. 
[00:28:30]  It was really...  And then you've got the big, huge police guy trying to hold everyone back.  Yeah.  He's going to be the hero.  Unfortunately, there isn't any one big seller this year.  I love when that happens.  Because I love watching the crying children and the angry parents thinking they're going  to win their child's love with a fucking Furby doll.  And there isn't really anything this year.  No Tickle Me Elmo.  None of that stuff?  No.  No, that's what I've heard.  There's no one big item that all the kids are looking for this year. 
[00:29:00]  The Tickle Me Elmo was the big item.  Don't they this year have the doll with the wafer nose and it's called Diddle Me Michael?  Wafer nose.  Hey, wafer thin nose, monsieur.  Come here.  Oh, Diddle Me Michael.  All right.  Let's take our first phone call in five days.  Oh.  Is this L.A. or Louisiana?  Chris, what's going on?  It's Louisiana, man.  Louisiana checking in. 
[00:29:30]  What's up?  Not much.  Can't hear you, sir.  Go ahead, Chris.  His phone crapped out.  Did we lose you, Chris?  All right.  That was good.  Thanks.  Chris, he's still there.  You're on the air.  He's gone.  Too bad.  We want to talk to Chris.  So, Ben, Norton's putting together his own Variety Hour.  What's that all about?  Jim's very motivated.  And when is this going to air?  Because I think a lot of people are going to want to really check out the music that  Jim picks for the Variety Hour and the bits and all that.  Well, of course, he doesn't have his music figured out yet, so we'll do it next week. 
[00:30:00]  We should pre-promote it.  We should definitely pre-promote it.  We'll do it next week sometime.  Is somebody going to look at what he does, or is it going to be purely his, and whatever  he picks is going to be gone?  No, whatever he picks goes.  How much Sabbath is going to be popular?  I'll have a couple, but I won't go crazy.  Just a couple of songs.  What other artists will you play in there?  Johnny Cash, probably, I love.  One Ozzy or two Ozzy, maybe some old Kiss.  I'll play stuff that other people like.  Any of the stuff I turned you on to?  Yeah, I'll probably play a Lead Belly.  I'll play some weird songs.  Is this Ozzy and Sabbath? 
[00:30:30]  You're going to do like a sub-Sabbath, and then also some Ozzy on top of that?  Not too many, though.  I won't overdo it.  I mean, I'll play a Sabbath song that I love, and maybe one Ozzy that I love.  Right?  Will you do that Nirvana song you like?  Which one?  And an illustrated book about birds.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah, that's a good song.  I'll play that.  That's fine.  I was showing Jim earlier.  I bought the Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  Remember how we did the top 20?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Well, Paranoid came in at 250, Jim.  Oh.  That's cool.  At least it's on the list.  Yeah.  Now, Jim wanted it in the top 20.  No, but top 100. 
[00:31:00]  What's the song that just beat Paranoid?  Yeah.  Chain of Fools by Aretha Franklin.  Rapper's Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang before that.  Yeah, that's better than Paranoid.  Yeah, you're right.  Wonder Mike.  Stupid, guilty white people.  Ugh.  How's that song, Rapper's Delight?  Hotel Motel Holiday.  Hotel Motel.  Yeah, that's much better than Paranoid.  A hippie.  A hippie.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say hi to Matt in Jersey.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good, bro.  How you doing, Norton? 
[00:31:30]  Hi, Matt.  Just wanted to go on the Black Friday thing.  Yeah.  Walmart out in PA.  They opened up their doors about 5.30 with all the vultures in.  And everybody had to stand by the item that they wanted, all circling around the items,  until 6 o'clock when they finally made the announcement.  And everybody went and grabbed for everything that they wanted.  Why would they make an announcement of what?  Oh, to stop a stampede, you mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, they were trying to stop the stampede of letting people in by having the people stand 
[00:32:00]  around the item that they wanted.  Oh, that's good.  That's insane.  How about this?  They just go back and re-raise them properly as children so they don't become greedy, bargain-hunting  pigs when they're adults.  Fat pigs.  I'm glad they're killing each other.  And they all look the same.  You're right.  They're all these fat pigs that go in there.  And it's the only exercise they probably get all year is running from the front door to  some piece of crap that they think somebody's going to want for Christmas.  Blech.  Anthony, what's going on? 
[00:32:30]  Hey, how's it going, guys?  I saw you guys over at Downtown Wednesday.  You guys were great.  Oh, that was a lot of fun.  Yeah, it really was.  Cool.  I saw you guys a PowerPoint presentation.  I saw you guys.  A PowerPoint presentation.  What the hell is a PowerPoint presentation?  That's one of those things you click on and all of a sudden it's like a slideshow.  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah.  And you sent us something?  Yeah, I sent it to Steve's email because I figured he probably checked it.  What is it?  Pictures from the Downtown?  Yeah, pictures from the Downtown with little captions and stuff. 
[00:33:00]  All right, we'll check that out.  Cool.  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Thank you.  You guys rock.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, we've got to get another event.  You want to do New Year's or what?  We've got to figure that out.  Broadcast live, New Year's?  New Year's Eve, you want to do a little broadcast live?  To ring in 05?  Ha ha ha.  Ring out 04.  Why not?  You know, we should probably take a quick break here.  You want to do that?  Yeah.  We're just getting warmed up.  Rob from Long Island, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you guys were talking about the little variety hour thing. 
[00:33:30]  I was thinking, because I love the variety hour every morning.  That's the thing I look forward to.  You guys should do a little contest or something on your website.  I like listeners, you know, do like a list of 20 songs with like comedy acts and stuff  like that.  And you could like pick the best one and give out like a little prize or something, you know?  It's really not a bad idea.  We really got to start programming this channel a lot better.  We just want to get in here, settle, figure this whole satellite radio thing out, and now  we're going to take it to the next stage.  I like that, actually. 
[00:34:00]  It's not a bad idea.  I saw you guys over at the downtown.  Great show.  Oh, cool.  I think we want to just open up the channel and just allow you guys to completely program  an hour or two.  Get maybe a phone line and you could, you know, say whatever the hell you want and request  songs and just, you know, just make it into a huge cluster F, like literally whatever you  want to say.  Like instead, like we have the FU line, but instead of the FU line, maybe you could talk  for like 30 seconds or 40 seconds.  About whatever you want.  Yeah.  And then we'll pick the best ones and you request a song.  We're going to do all sorts of stuff as we move forward here. 
[00:34:30]  Chris is, oh no, this is Chris from, okay, Chris in Texas.  What's up, Chris?  Not much, man.  Hey, I figured y'all get a kick out of this.  Somebody super glued 247 doors shut at a mall in Lafayette.  They super glued all the doors shut?  Yeah, they super glued all the locks so they wouldn't be able to open it up.  Oh, that's great.  That's the kind of thing I like to hear.  Very cool.  I was laughing my ass off when I heard about it.  I figured y'all get a kick out of it.  Oh, hell yeah.  Fantastic.  Hell yeah.  All right, let's go to Ohio.  Dan, what's up? 
[00:35:00]  Hey, not a whole lot, guys.  What's going on?  Welcome back.  Oh, thanks.  Hey, it was just calling the whole variety hour Jimmy's got playing.  Hey, Jimmy, how you doing, buddy?  How are you, fella?  Hey, just make sure you don't turn it gay like you did all last week with the Monster Rain.  What?  I didn't do Monster Rain last week, sir.  I did that when I was a boy.  Yeah.  Well, I know that, but you talked about it all week, and it couldn't get any gayer than that.  No, we're getting the gay out of the show, sir.  Yeah, we're not talking about Monster Rain.  We're not recommending it. 
[00:35:30]  We're just discussing it as a thing that happened.  Right.  I know, but you guys are back on the air.  Everybody's catching the virus, which is great.  And all you hear is about little Jimmy Norton sucking off people.  Well, you have to put it like that.  Well, you know.  Who else was singing Get Your Cock Out all weekend, man?  Yeah.  Holy crap.  That's a catchy little ditty.  Where is that damn thing?  There's some awesome songs you guys got going, coming in.  We'll play that going into break.  Get your cock out.  It's just such a catchy little thing. 
[00:36:00]  A couple more.  Jim from Jersey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, listen.  I heard that the Stampede was actually for something good, like, I don't know, the MiFi.  Oh, for the MiFi?  Yeah, that's what they should have stampeded for.  Yeah, now that's worth a stampede.  Absolutely.  Everyone is trying to get their hands on those MiFis.  They're going to go really fast.  When are they going to sell?  I think next week or something, right?  The portable XM satellite radio unit?  Just in time for Christmas.  Just in time for Christmas. 
[00:36:30]  I've got to get a few of those for some people in my family.  Good luck.  Mike in South Carolina.  The phone's just exploded.  We're going to take a break.  But, Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I've been a listener a long time back when you guys were at NEW.  I grew up in Wooster, as Voss would say it.  Oh, Worcester?  Worcester, yeah.  Worcester.  Worcester, Massachusetts.  I was actually back home over the holiday here, and I heard this douchebag on AAF talk 
[00:37:00]  about the same 500 songs from Roland that you guys did.  Almost did the exact same bit.  Well, I mean, that's a basic bit that I'm sure a lot of radio guys did.  I just hope we made it a little funnier and more entertaining than the other douches out there.  That's the goal, isn't it?  That really is the goal.  I mean, that's a no-brainer radio bid if you're a radio guy, so.  Yeah.  All right, Mike.  The goal of this show, can I say the goal of this show, and I think the listeners should  know this, it's Fun with a capital F.  Oh, thank you.  That's good.  Virginia checking in. 
[00:37:30]  Put a sign up that says that in here.  VA, what's up?  You got me?  Yeah, I don't have your name on the screen, so.  It's Robert.  Hey.  How's it going, gentlemen?  All right, man.  Bob.  Hey, Jimmy, you rock, buddy.  Thank you, fella.  I was in West Virginia at a high school state football game.  It's a tight game.  End of the game to go into overtime.  So the home team scores a touchdown in overtime.  Then the visiting team comes back and may score a touchdown.  They go to kick the extra point to tie the game in overtime. 
[00:38:00]  The kid misses the field goal.  He walks to the sideline.  The coach punches him.  Punches him?  Punches him in the face.  The other coach is tackling.  He takes off running.  The police tackle him.  Merry Christmas.  You're in jail.  How old was the kid he punched?  He was in high school.  And the boy had missed the field goal?  He missed the extra point.  Okay, so what?  So what?  So what?  Is the boy being disciplined?  No.  No, the coach is in jail.  The coach is in jail? 
[00:38:30]  He's just doing some coaching.  I know.  You're trying to teach this kid to kick the ball.  I bet you he won't miss another extra point all year, though, will he?  The great Santini.  Yeah.  Hey, sports fans.  How you doing?  Tuma.  Sir, please don't break my honey jars.  All right, why don't we step aside?  The wheels are falling off here, but we're back.  Hope you had a great few days there.  And we'll continue with the radio show.  We got lots to do to hear.  Is that oatmeal?  Yeah, I got my oatmeal.  I'm ready to eat that.  Get your cock out.  Now that it's really cold, yeah, we'll play Get Your Cock Out. 
[00:39:00]  And we'll continue.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says, get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth. 
[00:39:30]  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy.  Crawl under the porch.  Yeah, I said it.  Crawl under the porch.  The monster rain's coming.  The sky's gray.  My pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Y'all know the game.  Monster fucking rain.  It ain't a damn thing changed.  You're all under the porch.  Your friend fellates you.  Crawl under.  As two digits masturbate you.  I alleviate the stress with a cock caress.  I explode on my friend's neck with a monster mess. 
[00:40:00]  Just two little boys.  No need for vagalube.  Suck on a little crotch with a slight lack of pubes.  We gotta keep it quiet.  Make sure mom don't find out.  I'll finish you off quick so I can pull mine out.  It's just a little pleasure with a lot of shame.  Who cares I gotta blame it all on the monster rain.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy says get your cock out.  Put my cock in your mouth.  Put your face south while we're under the house.  Jimmy.  Crawl under the porch.  Yeah, I said it. 
[00:40:30]  Crawl under the porch.  The monster rain's coming.  The sky's gray.  My pants down.  Two kids helping each other under the damn house.  Jimmy Norton.  Get your cock out.  Jimmy Robinson.  Get your cock out.  Willie D'Angelo.  Get your cock out.  Everybody.  Get your cock out.  It's time to find America's sexy thing. 
[00:41:00]  Let's hear it from California.  This guy's a champ, man.  Lucky girl. 
[00:41:30]  I need a towel.  I need a towel.  Come on.  They're applauding from the other booth, too.  Thumbs up.  Stop, Jim.  Jesus Christ, Jim.  Think you can do better?  Call O.P. and Anthony live at 866-WOW1-WOW  and give it your best shot.  How big does that thing get?

[00:43:00]  I'm saying to myself, two white guys fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world?  Boy, that Spielberg's something else.  White guys cannot box.  Black guys fight better.  Puerto Ricans fight even better.  I guess the lower you go on a social ladder, the better you fight.  You think about for every good Puerto Rican fighter?  There's American Indians waiting to kick his ass. 
[00:43:30]  I feel so sorry for the Indians, man.  Because we took, well, we didn't take you.  White people took their land.  And now they have nothing.  Everybody exploits the Indians, man.  You got fucking Mazzola commercials and F-Proof and the Washington Redskins.  Redskins, that's not nice.  That's a racial slur, man.  That's kind of like having the New York niggas, okay? 
[00:44:00]  Denver Dykes, man.  Can't have that shit, man.  Remember the commercial?  The Indian had a tear in his eye for pollution?  Wasn't crying for pollution.  He took his land and fucked his wife.  I don't think he was crying because there was a tear, you know,  or because there was a fucking can on the ground.  Yeah, you could fuck my wife, but that can gotta go. 
[00:44:30]  Get it all in.  I went to a Chinese restaurant in New York,  and the bitch I was with said there was hair in her food.  You know, I said, where's her hair, baby?  She said, right here.  I said, well, fuck it, we ain't gonna pay for that shit.  Hey, man.  Come here, man.  Some hair in the food.  Oh, you don't have no food? 
[00:45:00]  I said, no, motherfucker.  There's some hair in the food.  I don't say I don't have.  I said, yeah, yeah, motherfucker.  There's some hair.  What the fuck you talking about?  Take this shit out of the way.  And the bitch talking about, oh, it's all right.  Shut up, bitch.  If it's all right, why didn't you eat the shit?  I said, I ain't paying for shit. 
[00:45:30]  Come on, let's get the fuck out of here.  And we was leaving.  The motherfucker grabbed me.  But he didn't grab me like motherfuckers grab you,  because we'd have been fighting all night.  They know that karate and shit.  That's how much was that?  Gave the motherfucker a tip and everything else.  Because I heard bones and shit snapping. 
[00:46:00]  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony,  Jim Norton sings.  Forget me not.  You sightless caught.  Your dog just shit on my rug.  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  I say, don't you know?  You say you don't know.  I say, take me out.  I say, you don't show.  Don't move down the road. 
[00:46:30]  I say, take me out.  Before we move on, one more call about Black Friday.  Let's say hi to Ian on Long Island.  What's up, Ian?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  You tell us.  This past Friday, I almost got to a physical fist buy at Circuit City over on MiFi,  but I got the MiFi in my hand, and that person walked away almost crying.  Wait, so they are selling the MiFis already?  Long Island, they're selling the MiFis over in Comac at Circuit City.  They got 15 in.  They had four left by the time I got there.  Some guy tried to buy all four of them. 
[00:47:00]  And I was like, no, no, no.  I'm getting one of them.  I'm a little worried that they didn't produce enough MiFis.  I think these things are going to go so fast.  Yeah, I just got a note handed to me.  The MiFis are on sale now at Best Buy and Circuit City.  This thing is unbelievable.  The little dogging company is like a year or two away from having anything close to what this thing can do.  Yep.  It's your portable XM satellite radio, basically kind of like an iPod.  It's as big as an iPod, maybe a little bigger but lighter. 
[00:47:30]  And you can just download whatever you want to listen to and then listen whenever you want.  It's just amazing.  And then you can listen to the channels live as well.  Yep.  Besides that, when you listen to a recorded show, you can fast forward to all the commercials and jump right to your show,  which is great.  I love them, the MiPads.  It's a great thing I've ever got.  That's beautiful.  We don't really play a lot of commercials on the show, though.  No, no, buddy.  If you're in a commercial for the XM LiFi or for the SkyFi, you can jump right to the program and back to the program.  That would think all that. 
[00:48:00]  You know, I've got to get a MiFi because when I listen to the replays, I'll know when we really stink and go,  all right, I know that was just awful.  I want to hear the next bit, which I knew was really good.  There you go.  And then maybe we can even give people a clue on what parts to listen to the show,  and then your listening time will be down, and maybe you can go enjoy your life.  All right, thanks.  I love checking out.  Thank you very much.  All right, cool.  Yeah, we're going to have MiFis to give away.  I think starting this week, we've got one a week to give away for the next five or six weeks.  Ooh.  We're kind of developing it.  We're thinking of maybe doing a contest. 
[00:48:30]  What would you do for a MiFi?  Something like that.  A prize.  Finally, a prize on the Opie and Anthony show.  Go to opiananthony.com later today.  We'll have some details on the MiFi giveaway, all right?  All right.  A lot of things happened while we were taking our little break.  Yeah.  Like Shelly Long ODing.  Yeah, I saw that on the cover of one of the papers over the long weekend,  and it looked like she was, like I thought somebody from Cheers was dead, you know?  Saw OD and think, you know, dead, but no. 
[00:49:00]  No.  Yeah, she pulled out of it.  A cry for help.  A cry for help.  She broke up with her boyfriend.  What's her boyfriend?  The husband, I'm sorry.  The husband broke up with her.  Ouch.  And she went into a deep depression and started sleeping all day.  And unfortunately...  She just put this happy song on.  I know.  Just put this happy song on and everything's fine.  Yeah.  Be reminded when things were good for you, when you were young and hot and happening in Hollywood.  Yeah, this is what she wants to hear today. 
[00:49:30]  Instead of what was written in the paper, one of her friends said,  it's very sad to see this woman who is only 55 looking like she's turning 90.  Oh, boy.  For 18 months, she's been getting more and more depressed.  It's like seeing someone falling off a cliff.  She told some of her good friends she felt she had nothing to live for.  You know what I found funny, by the way, about reading that in the paper over our break was...  Hopefully nothing, Ben.  Whatever, Dick.  They interviewed a bartender at the Bull and Finch in Boston.  Yeah, he's been there for, what, 30 years or something? 
[00:50:00]  First of all, the Bull and Finch doesn't even look anything like Cheers, but he's some expert about her.  I was just like, what an idiot's in the post.  Yeah, who went to that angle?  Oh, thanks, Ben.  Here it is, actually.  Eddie Doyle, the real-life Ted Danson.  Oh, yeah.  Who served drinks for 30 years at the Bull and Finch pub in Boston.  The bar in which Cheers was based on said,  I'm just really surprised and hope she's going to be all right.  I guess they say things like that happen around the holidays.  That guy really gave the scoop.  Good thing they went to him for the skinny.  That guy really has his finger on the pulse of what's going on in Hollywood. 
[00:50:30]  What a new angle, Boston boob.  That was the worst part of, one of the worst parts of living in Boston,  was any time he got a visitor.  Can we go to Cheers?  Cheers?  It doesn't look like the Cheers on TV.  Yeah, they only use the outside shot of the place, and that's it.  And obviously the bar that you saw in that show was Hollywood-produced or whatever.  Yeah, the closest thing was like the stairway that went downstairs into it. 
[00:51:00]  I don't even think that was close.  No, that was.  That was like, yeah, because it's kind of the outside establishing shot, you know?  Yeah.  But you'd always get people that want to go to Cheers,  and what a touristy dump that is with the T-shirts, sweatshirts, the beer mugs.  Oh, enough with the Cheers.  But every city has that, every city.  You know, when you get visitors to New York, can we go see the Empire State Building?  You can see it from anywhere.  I've lived here my whole life.  I think I've been there once.  Did you actually go up? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, on a school trip when I was, I think, 12.  I can't be bothered.  I've never been to the Statue of Liberty.  That's right over there.  That's within three miles of where we sit.  Yeah, but the Statue of Liberty is more of a pain in the ass to get to.  Not that it's a pain in the ass to get to, but a little more than the Empire State Building.  And I've never been to the Empire State Building.  No?  Or the Statue of Liberty.  I went to there, the Trade Center, Statue of Liberty, all those places.  I went to Windows on the World at the Trade Center.  Well, yeah.  Had dinner up there.  Yeah, that you had to do, but.  Yeah.  The guy jumped off the Empire State Building the other day.  I know, the other day.  What? 
[00:52:00]  The guy jumped.  There's video on the two somewhere.  He jumped off, I think it was Thursday or Friday.  Yeah.  Didn't he hit something like a fifth floor awning or something?  Sixth floor landing.  Sixth floor landing from the 86th floor observatory.  800 feet.  Oof, that is a far, far drop.  Yeah.  You think when you're jumping from that height, like, right away you realize what a stupid  idea this was?  Hey, I can see my house from here.  I'm still, still falling. 
[00:52:30]  That gives you a little too much think time, doesn't it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's much better ways to kill yourself than jumping from a building.  Shelley Long justifiably should kill herself, though.  I mean, I, I, no, because look, when you walk off a series like Shears, six years before,  when you do that and you're filmed, like David Caruso.  That sticks with you.  Did it?  McLean Stevenson.  Well, David Caruso, at least, was able to recover.  Ten years later, though.  Yeah.  You know something, though?  Even ten years later, now you can say to yourself, well, you know, I kind of came out 
[00:53:00]  of it.  Shelley Long got nothing and nowhere after that.  Yeah.  She left a show that was, you know, on top.  Sure.  For years after she left.  She thought she was better than the show.  Yeah.  That's what it comes down to.  A lot of these actors think they're better than the show.  Yeah.  Well, here's the picture of the guy.  Holy.  It's not a picture of the guy.  Oh, there's the body.  I do hear there's footage, though.  The Empire State Building has cameras at the top, videos, and I heard that there's actually  a video of him jumping.  What picture is that, Opie?  Well, it shows what an underachiever he is. 
[00:53:30]  He couldn't hit the sidewalk.  He missed by five floors.  Wow.  And he didn't miss by that far, either.  Yeah.  He was about seven feet from the edge of, you know, I guess this is the fifth floor or  whatever.  Did he bang into the building on the way down or anything?  I don't know.  That's a hard building to jump off of, because it gets fatter as it goes down.  A suicidal man dressed in black scaled a 10-foot fence and leaped to his death from the Empire  State Building's 86-floor observation deck.  It wasn't Earl, was it? 
[00:54:00]  Horrifying holiday dressed in black.  Maybe.  Have we heard from Earl?  I actually did see him over the weekend.  Oh, man.  He's too bad.  Horrifying holiday tours yesterday morning.  Yeah, that's a good little holiday thing.  Merry Christmas.  Be traumatized.  I saw a man near me push his kids out of the way and say, look out, said Keith, one  of the many tourists who watched the man plunge.  Are you ready for this?  1,000 feet.  Nice.  1,000 feet.  I looked up and I saw the guy falling, said Watley, a real estate agent from Atlanta. 
[00:54:30]  I don't care where he's from.  He was laying flat on his back like he was sleeping on a bed in the air, and he was kind  of spinning.  And then he just watched him fall.  The guy was mesmerized for several seconds until the man hit a six-floor roof and was  instantly killed.  You think?  Instantly.  There was a loud bang.  Wow.  There you go.  A loud bang.  Yeah, I'm surprised he didn't go right through.  No, he hit a...  It's concrete when he hit.  Is it?  It's like a...  It's one of those... 
[00:55:00]  That's good on the radio.  Move your hand back and forth.  Back and forth.  It's one of those...  You're looking at me, you know what I'm saying.  People hearing it can't...  He hit part of the building.  It's concrete.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  All right.  Merry Christmas.  Merry effing Christmas.  It wasn't NYU, though.  See, there's been all those jumpings at NYU lately.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  And said a couple weeks ago that they need to install trampolines all around NYU.  Boing.  Hey, isn't that that depressed Asian coming up by the window? 
[00:55:30]  I don't know.  Boing.  Don't look at her face.  She'll never figure it out from that.  Can't tell if she's blowing out birthday candles or shooting herself.  Just one look.  One look for everything.  One look for everything.  She's like those AOL icons.  Yeah.  They try to have their...  Man, that's an over-explain a bad joke.  I was with you, though.  I wasn't with you, though.  I wasn't there.  Because as soon as I said it, I remembered the AOL icons have many different expressions.  Yeah, that's true.  So I just contradicted myself like a fool.  I was kind of with you. 
[00:56:00]  And then what's going on with the Staten Island doctor?  Trying to catch up on all the news that happened after last Wednesday.  We were just talking about him before we went away on vacation.  Dr. Gil Lederman.  And here in New York, if you live in New York, you know Gil.  He's the guy that used to do those commercials for Staten Island...  What was it?  It wasn't Staten Island Medical Center.  There was something like that.  Staten Island University Hospital?  Staten Island University Hospital.  We will treat you for cancers of the neck, chest, ribs, brain, ear, acoustic neuroma. 
[00:56:30]  It was like, it would give me the heebie-jeebies just having this guy talk over the radio.  It's just creepy.  And reminding you of all the tumors you can get in your lifetime.  I know, that's why it was awful.  I don't really need to know I could get a tumor of the neck or whatever you used to say.  You don't know that?  I've had cancer of the neck for years.  A year.  Trying to cure it with mice.  Oh, he would just be so creepy. 
[00:57:00]  They would play this bad...  It's the bad piano music that they would play in the background.  And it would make it even more depressing.  Yeah, where's that other music?  What did you put that on?  Did you put that cancer music on?  We have cancer music now?  No, you didn't put it on yet?  Oh, all right.  I'm talking to Eric.  Okay.  I'm just having a conversation with Eric.  That's all right, that's all right.  But, yeah, it would be like, you hear it for charity things on the radio. 
[00:57:30]  It's this bad piano music that they play now during these commercials that's really depressing.  And you just don't want to hear it.  And then it's Dr. Gil Liedemann talking about cancers you can get in your ears.  Cancer of the roof of your mouth.  Cancer of the nasal cavity.  Cancer of the eyeball.  Cancer of the retina.  Cancer of the inner ear.  Cancer of the forehead.  It's like, ugh.  And they play music.  It's not the piano music, but this is, like, the new thing.  It's just more depressing kind of cancer music. 
[00:58:00]  It's called cancer music.  They play this on what show?  I think this is it.  What show is this?  They did it on ER.  ER.  On movies.  Yeah.  That's not cancer music.  Hey, he's got a tumor!  Number one answer, tumor!  Oh, that was the spelling of you.  What was that spelling of you?  Give me a love.  Let me kiss you on the tumor.  This might be it.  That's it.  Yeah, it's like, this one they play when they're, yeah.  This is the cancer music?  Over the rainbow?  This is like a big, like, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  This is the new TV series, cancer music.  When there's somebody with cancer on the show, it's this shot of them maybe laying in bed,  and the camera's panning around as they're maybe dying, and this song is playing.  Nice, depressing show.  Oh, this guy's like 600 pounds and sings this.  He's some Hawaiian guy.  He's humongous.  Hawaiian?  Yeah, Hawaiian.  Yeah.  This is great.  It's that Hawaiian joint.  Yeah.  Is it all Mr. Hanalei?  But I did nothing wrong. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, yeah, all right.  And the guy just dropping dead in the bed, in the hospital bed.  They play this on ER, right?  When the Anthony Edwards doctor died, he was laying in some kind of open-air condo in the Caribbean,  and he just goes, oh, shit, and they let it go on the air, and he just fell off the bed,  and he's laying on the floor, and then it just pulls up, like a scene,  he's just panning out from the ocean and the condo, and it goes into the sky.  Why do people want to watch depressing shit?  I love depressing stuff.  I hate it. 
[00:59:30]  I don't need my heartstrings.  I would never watch those god-awful hospital shows because they're the most depressing things you can watch.  I like cop shows where scales are being shot.  And, you know, I remember that scene with Anthony Edwards.  They're trying to make it seem like he went out his way, and he's overlooking the ocean and the Caribbean in perfect weather,  and this song's playing as he's dying from cancer.  The reality is we're all going to have a horrendous ending.  No one dies nice. 
[01:00:00]  It always ends in some horrific tragedy.  I think your own terms is not dying.  Here's your own terms.  Climb the 10-foot fence and leap off the 86th floor.  Well, yeah.  Those were his own terms.  This is awful.  I like this.  This is depressing.  Isn't it?  Big fat Hawaiian.  Anyway, so the skin-headed nerd laying on the floor.  What happened?  What happened to his hair?  Those rotten white blood cells ate up the whole inheritance. 
[01:00:30]  What happened to Goose?  Oh, my God.  He was Goose.  Right on.  He was Goose.  What happened?  That was a way to go out.  Ejecting from your fighter and hitting your head on the canopy.  Not laying there while Fatty sings this song.  Horrible.  Hey, Anthony, you know how we like to go backwards before you get to the Staten Island doctor?  Oh, yeah.  Can you do the backwards noise for us?  Mitch, this is a bomb.  Mitch, can you imagine?  Go to what?  Neat.  Yeah, so it's a real bummer about Shelly Long, you know, with the OD thing. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to the phone and talk to Tom in Ohio.  What's up, Tom?  How you doing, Poe?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, man.  Seems like there's something with that cheers roll, because you got one of them that OD'd  on drugs or whatever she took, and then the other one looks like she may OD on pork chops.  Oh, Kirstie Alley?  Where is the Star Magazine with Kirstie Alley where she admits that no one wants to F her anymore?  You know what?  This is a great move for her because she's everywhere.  You cannot pick up a tabloid without her big, fat face. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, where was the one?  It was around here for a while.  She was on the cover, and she admitted she's like over 200 pounds now, and no one wants  She's huge.  And no one wants to have sex with her.  Where is that thing?  Oh, this is the other version.  Yeah, it's a different version.  She was so hot in Rathacon.  Remember that?  She was in Rathacon.  Was she?  I think so.  No, she was in the other one.  Yeah, this is-  She was in the third one or the second one.  She played V'ger?  No.  Which Star Trek was she in? 
[01:02:00]  I don't know.  I thought she was in it.  She was.  She was in Cheers.  She was in Vulcan ears.  Ben, if you can, I know we never got to, but you've got to find the other one where  she's on the cover.  It was Rathacon, wasn't it?  Oh, yeah, here it is.  She looks like Ozzy there.  Holy ass.  I said she looks like Ozzy.  She really does.  And look, she's giving the finger like, I don't care anymore.  She cares.  Yeah, the cover of the Star Magazine, 260 pounds, Christy Alley, too fat for sex.  Too fat for sex?  260 pounds she's up to now. 
[01:02:30]  She confesses no sex for over four years.  Oh, my God.  And that she still can't stop, uh, she can't stop pigging out.  Ugh.  Yeah, so, uh, she's a mess as well.  Yeah, you saw that starting to happen during Cheers, but I guess the producers kept it in  check.  Mm-hmm.  They do that.  They wield an iron fist, those guys, sometimes.  They're very blunt.  Lose some weight, you're getting a little fat in the ass.  And, uh, she went on all kinds of diets, looked good again.  But then once Cheers ended, it just didn't matter anymore. 
[01:03:00]  Did not matter to her.  It's been a rough, uh, few years for Christy Alley.  Um, she's 53, by the way.  And not just because her career has been in a slump.  On the episode of Oprah Winfrey's show that aired, Christy made a shocking revelation.  She hasn't had sex in four and a half years, confessing,  I don't want to have fat sex.  I don't want to have fat sex?  I've seen myself naked, I couldn't believe it, and so I just was crushed.  So I don't have sex anymore.  I don't want to have fat sex.  I respect that.  What's fat sex? 
[01:03:30]  I don't know.  Someone's got to...  You know, if she doesn't want to have it, she's had it and it went awful, you know?  Like just, oh, the guy left during the middle of it.  I can't even be part of this fat sex.  I guess by the end of the show, we've got to define what fat sex is today.  Fat sex.  It's sweaty, it stinks, and it doesn't involve the vagina or the anal cavity.  I think the guys are just having sex with the folds.  The folds.  That's fat sex.  It does look, when you see those big fat women porno pictures that people have some need to send you, 
[01:04:00]  it looks like it would be very hard to really get in there, you know?  It just looks like there's a lot of baggage out front.  And also a lot of emotional things you'd have to, like, block out for yourself,  the fact that you're mounting a rhinoceros.  And you know you're thinking, hey, it's Kirstie Alley.  Yeah.  You know, it's a celebrity.  Then you see that big fat bullfrog thyroid looking at you, and you're like, ugh.  That bloated fat girl thyroid, you just want to sink your teeth into it. 
[01:04:30]  That tire tube Florida Evans thing around the neck.  Right under the neck.  James!  Is that a tumor?  Big tire tube.  That's funny.  Treadless skid.  Ah, Rob in Baltimore.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, I was watching HBO this weekend, and Kirstie actually has a show coming on HBO called Fat Actress.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's marketing this fat, fat Kirstie thing. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, she's going with it.  Yeah, she's like eating some big-ass plate of spaghetti in front of her.  Man, you got to take care of yourself.  You have a clip, Eric?  What does he have a clip of?  Oh, we have a video clip from our show, I guess.  Oh, really?  When did we start doing a TV show?  I don't know.  We just got it this morning.  Somebody emailed it to us, so we can have it up on the website very soon.  Oh, oh, you're just going to...  Okay, I thought we were going to play it.  No.  It'll be up on opianthony.com.  She was Lieutenant Savick on Star Trek The Wrath of Khan. 
[01:05:30]  The best Star Trek, in my personal opinion.  Is that the second one?  That was the second one, yeah.  Yeah, second one.  Damn Yankee from VA.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, hey.  Kirstie Alley ain't that fat?  She ain't that fat?  Hell no, I've been there right over, bud.  She's 260 pounds.  That's okay.  I'm 6'4", 300 pounds.  I've been there right over.  He is from Virginia, after all.  You've got to remember, it comes with the territory.  It certainly does.  They love their fat broads down south. 
[01:06:00]  All right, love them.  Well, damn Yankee with Duke, Kirstie Alley.  Let's say hi to Brian in Virginia.  And a girl with a little meat on her bones.  Looks like a lot of people in Virginia got their XM satellite radios recently.  A lot of people in Virginia.  All right, cool.  What do you have, Brian?  Definition for fat sex.  Yeah.  When you're trying to find a wet spot, you flip through the rolls,  and you smell shit, and then you turn back one.  That old tag.  That was a good one.  I never heard that one.  Oh, you never heard that one?  No.  That's good.  Thank you, Brian.  Later, guys. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  Brewsome.  Should we fast forward back to the Staten Island doctor?  Oh.  All right, so we're over here now.  Oh, with the cancer music again.  Yeah.  This is great, actually.  It's awful.  You don't like it?  No.  Isn't it horrid?  And you don't either.  Shut up.  I actually do.  I like it.  Stop it.  You don't.  Dude, I like depressing stuff.  I was never into that.  You like to just sit back and get depressed?  If it's quality, if it's something that's trying to yank an emotion at me,  I'll spit my gum at the TV, but if it's genuine.  Give me one example where it was quality, 
[01:07:00]  where you sat back and enjoyed something depressing.  Whose life is it anyway?  Richard Dreyfuss.  John Cassavetes.  He plays an artist who becomes a quadriplegic in a car wreck,  and his whole thing is he's fighting for his right to die.  It's unbelievable.  Richard Dreyfuss is amazing.  Oh, I went to try out ER one night.  I figured, what's all the hoopla with this show?  I'm going to check it out.  I figured, you know, maybe I'm just, maybe I'm jumping to conclusions on it,  and every episode isn't depressing, 
[01:07:30]  and perhaps I'll get one of the funny ER episodes or something,  you know, where the general plot underlying is funny.  I know what you're going to say, but go ahead.  I turn it on, and it was an episode where there was a car accident,  and they have to bring this little kid into the room where the mother is dead,  and then the doctor is explaining to the child how they will have these,  your mommy is going to have tubes. 
[01:08:00]  Your mommy is going to have tubes coming out of her mouth,  and that's what we use to try to help your mommy,  and don't be afraid of those,  and they lead the kid in, and the kid's crying,  and it was one of those.  Right.  I used to be an ER fan.  I used to be an ER fan.  I'm trying to move on.  But they just tell you every week of other things you could die from 
[01:08:30]  and other diseases that you had no idea were out there.  If you have any hypochondria, you will think you have some of these things.  Right.  The people come in, they got these symptoms, and you're like,  oh, my God, I had an earache.  Right, right.  And you're thinking now it's a tumor in the brain,  and now you're watching what you're going to have to go through.  Yeah.  Now you're thinking, I got cancer in my ear.  Yeah.  Cancer of the ear, neck, chest, throat.  You don't want cancer in your ear. 
[01:09:00]  Cancer in your ear?  Ear.  In your ear.  No.  You don't want cancer in your ear.  That's what I said.  Yeah, in your ear.  That old gag.  So what's going on with the Staten Island doctor?  Oh, hey, we're back.  Yeah, sort of.  Well, Gil Lederman was treating George Harrison.  Right.  For his cancer.  Well, he was the guy that got in trouble because George Harrison was down to what,  like 95 pounds, and the doctor's trying to get him to sign guitars and stuff?  Yeah.  That's really good.  He wanted to get him to sign some stuff, and he brought in a guitar to George Harrison's 
[01:09:30]  bedside.  And this was when George was, you know, he didn't even know who he was.  Oh, I'm Ringo.  He had no clue.  And he made him sign, made him, that's what they're saying, made him sign this guitar.  And people were outraged.  George Harrison's family, outraged, and brought a lawsuit against them.  Well, the judge that was ruling in the case is writing song parodies. 
[01:10:00]  He got up on the bench, and instead of just giving his verdict or whatever he's got to  do, he delivered it in song to something.  Uh, attracts fat press like no other doctor.  That's what he said. 
[01:10:30]  Something in the folks he meets.  He's in our jurisdiction now.  What?  I'm not saying it's a good song parody.  Judge is a hack.  He's getting Beatles autographs somehow.  This is what the judge wrote.  Yeah.  Something in the lawsuits he gets.  This is real?  You're not making this up?  Yeah, this is what he said.  Did he do this to the courthouse?  Attracts jurors like no other doctor. 
[01:11:00]  What?  Ha, ha, ha.  Something for his son that rocks.  What?  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jurors come just to see the Beatles doc.  He looked at George Harrison's cock.  I don't know.  He didn't write one for that one.  He didn't finish the rhyme?  No.  What did he do when Lenin got shot?  Did he say, imagine all the bullets emptied into your bespectacled face?  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:11:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Awful song parody.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  You're asking me to move this case.  You get emails.  Bad emails.  They can't be fair.  In this fair place, your case will fail.  Oh, it will fail.  What the?  Who do you write this to?  I guess to Dr. Gil Lederman.  He said this in the courthouse.  That's how crazy this guy is.  Your Honor, I wish you got cancer of the hand before you wrote this. 
[01:12:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Cancer of the wrist, fingers.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Something like upstate in Madison.  And all I have to do is move this child somewhere they don't know George Harrison.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  If this case I were to keep, defendants would, the defendant would gently weep.  Are you kidding me?  This guy wrote this.  What a kook.  Throw him off the bench. 
[01:12:30]  There's more?  No, that's pretty much it.  All right.  George, Justice Robert Giganti included in his legal decision involving the late Beatles' controversial cancer doctor.  He threw this song in, a parody to something.  Uh, Lederman and his colleagues at Staten Island University Hospital gave the 66-year-old New Mexico woman too much radiation in 2001, causing her death two months later. 
[01:13:00]  I guess he's up on other charges.  Wow.  Oof.  Oh, ow.  And he got mad because we played the circus music behind his, uh, commercial.  Uh, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, just quickly.  Doctor's latest problem centered on a wrongful death suit filed by the family of a colon cancer patient who was lured to Staten Island by Lederman's much-publicized claims of revolutionary cancer treatment. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, and they got mad at us for putting the music behind it.  Right.  And that's the one that gave a little too much radiation.  All right.  So what did the judge say about that woman?  Did he play a parody for another one, Bites the Dust?  That was an awful song parody.  Let's go to Clint in New Mexico.  Hey, Clint.  Oh, wait.  I messed up here, I think.  Oh, there you go.  Uh, Clint, you there?  I'm here.  All right, what's up, buddy?  Hey, uh, I wanted to refer to a great scholar by the name of Rodney Carrington. 
[01:14:00]  Okay.  With, uh, sex with a fat woman, it's like sticking your dick in a coffee can.  Hey, that's a coffee can.  Yeah.  But I think, it's funny, but I think it's a little hurtful to people who are overweight.  Shut up.  What?  You should be more sensitive on this show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that's a good line, I guess, if you like to hurt people.  Michael from Colorado, what's up?  Um, well, I got a fat chick story.  Okay, let's hear it.  All right, so I was living in Buffalo about, no, three years ago or so. 
[01:14:30]  And I meet this chick at a Christmas party.  They're not chicks.  They're called Buffalo Bettys.  Buffalo.  She was a Buffalo Betty.  Buffalo Bettys.  They got their, uh, their peacock hairdos, and they wear their oversized, uh, sweatshirts,  usually with the Bills logo on it, to cover up their bunts.  That's what you get in Buffalo.  Uh, yeah.  Nicknamed Buffalo Bettys.  Exactly.  Go ahead.  All right, so, I mean, I can't front.  I mean, I'm into big chicks, right?  You're into big chicks?  Yeah.  Well, I'm half blind anyway, so I figured they might as well be bigger so I can see them. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, but then you have to feel them.  That's the worst.  You rely on touch.  You have to touch that mammoth.  Touch and smell.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  It's one of the worst things you want with a fat broad.  All right, so here's where I get to the feeling part.  You want cancer of the nose, nasal passages, sinuses.  Go ahead.  Cancer of the cunt.  Cancer of the fingertips.  All right, go ahead, Michael.  Okay, anyway, so we get back to my place after a second date, and I'm realizing as she's  taking her clothes off, she's been wearing girdles, so she's smaller. 
[01:15:30]  So we kind of get into it because I'm feeling pretty bad because I've already committed to  the sex.  Not too sweaty underneath those.  Wait, you continued having sex with her because you felt bad?  Of course.  He's got her in his place.  He's committed.  I've committed to the sex.  You don't stop at that point.  Screw it.  You went the distance.  Now the chick's in your place and disrobing.  You've got to go for it.  There's a point where you're committed to the sex and you'll do it even though you don't  want to do it?  I'm with the guy.  This is something new for me.  It's a commit. 
[01:16:00]  It's a pass to fail safe.  You can't come up with some kind of crazy excuse at that point?  Well, I didn't.  I just figured I'd pretend she was someone else.  All right, so is she willing to set your house on fire?  Without a doubt.  You're pretty much committed.  I'll be right back.  Can you light a match?  You go, what the hell's going on?  Fire alarm goes off.  Oh, too bad.  Yeah, okay.  You actually have sex with someone you decide you didn't...  What the hell just arrived?  I don't...  Somebody delivered these things.  I don't know who they are, but who brought those in this morning? 
[01:16:30]  Steve.  Steve.  And we asked...  Me and Jimmy asked, what are those?  And Steve goes, they're plastic balls.  And Jimmy goes, what's inside them?  Thinking they were a case for something.  And he goes, no, they're just plastic balls.  You know, you can hang them places or...  Who's a brilliant idea?  I think you hang these on your tree.  I think Steve wears these earrings.  Steve, what the hell is this?  They're big plastic balls.  Someone's sitting around getting stoned with their friends going, wouldn't it be cool to  have like plastic balls to hang up? 
[01:17:00]  Let's make them.  Yeah.  You pretty much nailed it.  They're big plastic, I guess.  It looks like a sack.  It's a scrotum with balls in it.  The only way to describe it that I've found would be like fuzzy dice, but plastic, and  they're testicles.  And they're to be hung on a rear view window.  They're too heavy for a window, aren't they?  Oh, a rear view mirror.  Rear view mirror.  And then there's a hat that came with the box that says, got nuts.  Several different sizes.  The guy's got a whole website where he sells these things, and he said, would you like me 
[01:17:30]  to send you a box of stuff?  And he's like, go ahead.  I don't think that...  I don't get it.  I don't either.  I don't get it.  I don't think this one's going to take off.  Yeah.  It's not the next Pet Rock.  It's not the next Pet Rock or Baby on Board sign thing.  Right.  Baby on Board.  Oh, he's got t-shirts, too.  Got nuts.  Do they have any of those things that have maybe a lump in them?  Oh, no.  Or any with just one ball?  That's a pesticle.  And an empty sack?  They've got a lot of weight to them, so I don't know if they'd fit on a rear view mirror. 
[01:18:00]  This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  You step on the brakes, and your windshield gets broke.  Dude, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen.  You could throw these off the bridge in Long Island and kill a woman if you don't have a spare turkey.  Just throw these off.  The hole that's through here that's meant to hang it, it's made for a bolt to go through with a washer.  I don't understand what this is.  I think there's also pictures on this guy's website of them hanging off the back of car bumpers, like if you want to give your car a set of nuts.  Dude, this guy is, I don't know. 
[01:18:30]  What kind of pot does he smoke and where can I get some?  Here they are.  Here's me dropping one from six inches.  They weigh a ton.  This isn't a cute fuzzy dice thing.  You could, and then the Got Nuts t-shirt.  How about Got Bankruptcy, pal?  Because I really don't see this taking off.  And you left the best part off.  There's not even a delicious cock to enjoy.  Oh, and Got Nuts panties and baby tees. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  You could use this for a hammer.  This guy is trying.  I don't get it.  A real entrepreneur.  Somebody please kill their spouse with this.  How perfect would that be?  She was bludgeoned about the head with a plastic pair of nuts.  What is the website?  It's thenutshop.com.  The Nuts Shop.  The Nuts Shop.  For all your nut needs.  Buy nuts that you can work on your biceps with.  No reason for balls that are this heavy.  Ridiculous.  All right, let's get back to Michael in Colorado.  Ben, take these because they're probably the size of yours. 
[01:19:30]  I thought you guys were trying to get rid of all the gay.  That's not gay, though.  It's just an odd thing somebody said.  You know, we're one for getting rid of the gay.  But stop putting the gay tag on anything we talk about now, for God's sake.  A bunch of men can't just have a conversation about some balls for a few minutes?  Ridiculous plastic nuts that some guy's trying to sell?  All right, go ahead, Michael.  Okay.  So I guess you brought a fat girl home.  You didn't realize how fat she was until she removed her girdle that was keeping her less fat, I guess? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Okay.  And then you figured, you know, I invite her back to my place.  I've committed, so I have to have sex with her.  I really don't get that one, but okay, I'll go with it.  It happens.  I'm a sensitive guy.  I felt guilty.  All right, so what happened?  So I, you know, reached between her crotch, and she has the fattest pussy I have ever witnessed in my entire life.  She's not cute with pudgy lips like Norton likes.  I'm talking fat.  Like, she gained a lot of weight, and it all went to her cunt.  I mean, it was...  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[01:20:30]  Well, so you...  Careful with that word.  Let me see, sir.  I happen to like larger vaginal lips, but I mean, you're saying it was almost like the  leg extended into it, like that kind of fat?  It was, it was like flabby.  Like, like, was it, was it extra wide?  It was extra wide.  And extra high, and extra fat.  Extra fat.  That would be awful.  It was terrible.  So then, we get into it, and she says, wait a minute, I need to get some lube.  So she put this big glob of KY jelly on her. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, was she carrying it around in her purse or something?  Yeah, it was in her purse.  And so...  Gotta base that turkey.  Yeah, we get into it.  It's all getting into the folds of her stomach, and I'm covered in...  KY in the folds of her stomach.  Here we go.  He goes, I'm covered in it.  Yeah, because it's not just in the area.  Yeah.  You know, it's like if she ate our Hershey bar, it would be all over her face.  It's the same thing.  It just goes everywhere.  Oh, that's hilarious.  You're covered in KY.  What a sight. 
[01:21:30]  And I was disgusted.  Yeah.  And so, I'm pissed at this point, because I've been bamboozled, hoodwinked, and led astray.  So I just start giving it to her, and then we turn the lights on after we're done,  and I actually fake the orgasm.  And thank God I had the condom on so I could kind of get out of there and eject.  Turn the light on.  Face is red like a fucking Oopa Loompa.  She goes, oh, that's my rosacea.  She had rosacea, too?  Ugh.  What the hell is that? 
[01:22:00]  It's like Sterling Hitchcock, that Yankee pitcher.  They always, people with those perpetually apply red cheeks that you just want to smash.  Oh, there's a name for that?  Rosacea, yeah.  But sometimes it's not just apply red cheeks.  You can almost see the veins on the surface of the skin turning red, and it's blotchy.  So her face turned extra red because she had good sex with you?  I don't know what the hell that was.  That wasn't fat sex.  I don't know if it was that.  Fat sex.  Fat sex.  This must be the fat sex that Kirstie Alley's talking about that she doesn't want to be part of.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  And why she hasn't had sex in years.  No.  After I was done, I went into the shower, and there wasn't enough bleach or hot water to purify my skin.  Are you crying in the bottom of the shower?  I was going to say, you roll up into a ball.  I was going to say, you roll up into a beetle position.  And do the rape shower.  Yeah.  Take a rape shower.  Scrub yourself till the water gets cold in the tub.  I don't know what happened.  I just came home with a fat whore.  All right.  Thank you, Michael.  There's no reason for you to have done that either, man.  I don't know why you left sex so when you didn't want to.  Yeah, I don't get that either, but.  Robert H.  Mm-hmm.  From Salt Lake City is saying, if you ever come through Salt Lake, you'll see lots and lots of pickup trucks with those nuts on them. 
[01:23:00]  When I see those, I can't decide if it's for the truck or the lack of balls of the driver.  I guess it's for a lot of these people with the mentality of, god damn, you know, I drive a Ford and it's got balls.  And now your truck can have balls by putting the plastic nuts.  And it's got to be durable and heavy because it's going to be outside on a vehicle.  You know what the problem with this is?  There's no penis attached. 
[01:23:30]  No, no.  Can you please isolate that?  We need that clip.  Mark it.  But you're driving down the road, right?  And this is hanging from the back of a car.  You don't even know what it is at first.  It's just got to have balls.  That's why there's only veins on one side.  That's for the side that faces the people.  Right.  And the other side goes against your bumper.  It looks like it could be a hanging eggplant.  I don't know.  It does.  Yeah, it does look like a couple of eggplants.  Something.  It's just dumb.  It is really dumb.  Who's going to go, ha, look at that hanging from the car, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:24:00]  Where do I get mine?  No one.  I think it's, yeah, I think there's a certain mindset of people that might pick that up and  put it on their vehicle.  It's got balls, don't it?  Yeah.  Tony on Long Island, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Just to say, talk about taking one for the team.  I used to work for a company, and I dealt with a girl in Chicago who she moved down to  Atlanta.  And so we got talking, and I'd just broken up with my girlfriend, and so one night we 
[01:24:30]  started having phone sex after she gave me her home number.  So I said, you know what?  This is crazy.  Let's meet halfway between Atlanta and Richmond and find out, you know, let's have sex for  real.  So I get in the car.  It's Belmont weekend.  I'm stuck in traffic.  I'm bleary-eyed.  Nine hours later, I get down to Richmond, Virginia.  And I get out of the car, and she's like 350 pounds, and I'm like, holy shit.  You didn't, like, ask those questions before you decided to commit to a long drive? 
[01:25:00]  I was like, whatever.  You know, I'd just broken up with a girlfriend of four years.  I wanted to get one right out of the way just to have it happen.  And I got down there, and it was just like she was huge.  But I was like, I can't turn around without getting some, so I took one for the team.  I don't get that, man.  Oh, dude, that's awful.  I won't talk to a fat chick if she lives five minutes from me, much less drive nine hours 
[01:25:30]  and acknowledge one.  What's wrong with you?  All right, well, here's the real shame.  She was a real nymphomaniac, and I wanted to get anal sex.  So I flew down to Atlanta and banged her in the ass all weekend.  And it was horrible.  We're out in Buckhead, and there's, like, all these hot chicks.  And there I am with this big pig, like, just barred Buckhead.  Oh, wow.  It was horrible.  Did she want to go out?  Yeah, she's like, oh, let's go out.  So now you've got to walk around with her?  Yeah, it was horrible. 
[01:26:00]  She wanted to come to New York, and I was like, absolutely not.  Cut it off right there.  It's all about the anal sex.  I've walked around Buckhead.  You're right.  There's a lot of beautiful women in that area.  She walks around with a 350-pound girl because she needs to go out.  You got on a plane to have sex with a barnyard animal.  Congratulations.  That's hilarious.  Me too, guys.  All right.  I like when the honesty comes out on this show, man.  That's, you know, something that reminds me a lot of the Dreamweaver story from years ago. 
[01:26:30]  I remember that.  It was because I didn't want to be seen with her.  And, you know, it's self-centered.  It's nasty.  It's probably not the nicest thing to do.  But it was a girl that I met on the CB radio named to get Dreamweaver, of course.  That's the music.  Her name was Dreamweaver.  That was her CB handle, the Dreamweaver.  And what were you again?  I was Wrangler.  That's right, Wrangler.  I was the Wrangler because my job back then was on horseback.  I would keep, like, stable animals together and in their pens. 
[01:27:00]  Listen, I was a Wrangler.  You know, if any of the steer got out, I would wrangle them back in.  The Wrangler.  I hope that's why you got that name.  There's so many.  So that is why.  So did you use the CB radio to try to pick up chicks back then?  No, no.  Was it for the job?  I didn't use it to pick up chicks.  Everyone had a CB back then.  It was all the rage.  The mid to late 70s. 
[01:27:30]  So everyone had CB.  No one had cell phones, Opie.  So it was, you know.  Breaker, breaker.  Breaker for the Dreamweaver.  You got your ears on?  It's the Wrangler.  I'll be 10-10, 10-8 on the side.  Dreamweaver, if you're out there.  Okay, Dreamweaver.  If you're out there, the Wrangler's on the side.  Out.  But how did you start talking to her?  She just happened to be on the CB one day?  Yeah, I think I was trying to get in touch with somebody else. 
[01:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Maybe my brother Joe.  Hey, Flying Fingers.  You out there, Flying Fingers?  His name was Flying Fingers?  Yeah.  Why?  He's a guitar player.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I know.  Ugh.  Hey, Flying Fingers.  You out there?  And then, uh, one day I hear a voice over the radio.  And it was, uh, it was Dreamweaver. 
[01:28:30]  It's Dreamweaver.  And she, um, she almost had, like, an attitude, like, why am I talking on the bullhorn now?  Like, um, Daria on MTV.  You know, Daria?  She kind of had that whole thing, so it was kind of a cool attitude back then.  So I started talking to her.  You know?  Hey, Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler.  Well, where are you from? 
[01:29:00]  Oh, I'm from, uh, Dana Point.  Oh, I'm San Juan Capistrano.  I'm, I'm right, you know, down the road.  Oh!  Well, I gotta go.  Okay.  How old were you?  And then maybe...  Oh, God.  Thirteen?  Fourteen?  Yeah, thirteen.  Uh, and, and, you know, we kind of, you know, every night when I'd get on the CB radio...  She was there?  She was there.  You know, she was always on the CB.  And, uh, we, we would talk.  That should have been your first clue.  Should have been.  The first clue. 
[01:29:30]  Always on the CB radio.  And, uh, I decided one day that I was gonna ask her to, on a, a date.  A date.  But, you know, my term kind of date.  Not your ordinary date.  We're gonna go horse, horseback riding.  Because I have, uh, horses.  And that's what I do.  That's what I do now.  So, uh, you gotta, you know...  Uh, Dreamweaver to Wrangler.  I'd like to know what you're doing this Saturday.  Oh, nothing.  Oh, okay, uh, you wanna go horseback riding with me?  And you never met her?  Never met her.  That's the, that's the key to the story, okay. 
[01:30:00]  Never met her.  Okay, um, you know where, uh, the river, uh, bed, uh, splits in Capistrano?  Yeah, I know that.  Okay, I'll meet you there.  And, uh, we'll go riding this weekend.  We got a bunch of hills we could go riding up in.  Oh, that sounds great.  Okay, Dreamweaver out.  Okay, Wrangler, over and out.  I'll see you Saturday.  Were you all, were you all excited at this point?  Oh!  It's great!  Because you have this image in your head, what she looks like, probably.  Dreamweaver.  Weaver.  Oh, the name. 
[01:30:30]  It should say it all.  She's weaving dreams in my head.  Right.  Of what she could be.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver has to, has to be a hot chick, right?  Absolutely.  Dreamweaver.  So all day Saturday, all morning, I got up early.  I washed two horses.  Which, you know, it's quite a chore.  And, uh, brushed the horses down.  They looked great.  Uh, take some saddle soap to the, uh, saddle and everything.  Did you clean out their sheath? 
[01:31:00]  No, I didn't clean out the sheath.  Pulling out, tonks of beef jerky out of there.  I never understood the people that did clean out the sheath.  There was some stable...  I was cleaning out the sheath.  Dude, there was some stable whores, uh, that used to keep horses around where we kept them.  And they were girls, you know, in their teens.  They had these horses that used to clean their horses.  You know, you, you gotta clean the hooves.  You take this hook in your hand, lift the hoof up, and you, like, scraping horse shit out of their hooves.  Right.  Clean it out.  And then, uh, you brush them. 
[01:31:30]  You bathe them.  You gotta clean their teeth sometimes, you know, and their ears.  Uh, and then their sheath.  This is a male horse.  You know, they don't walk around with their dick hanging out all, all the time.  It goes up into a sheath that's on their underbelly.  This sheath gets filthy.  Oh.  And dried up skin and dirt.  And rocks get caught up in there.  All kinds of crap gets, gets caught in there.  And these girls would reach up, grab this giant horse cock, and just pull it out of the sheath and start picking off all this dirt. 
[01:32:00]  As they're just, you know, talking, hey, what's up, how you doing?  Does the horse get excited?  Uh, sometimes.  Yeah.  But most of the part, they're just looking around, you know, eating their hay and, uh, getting stuff picked off of them.  Just disgusting.  No, I didn't clean the sheath.  Just smelt it under your fingernails.  It did.  Some of these pieces were, like, beef jerky.  Dude, when I was at college, are you done with the sheath part? 
[01:32:30]  Because it's reminding me of something.  When I was at college, I had this roommate, um, and his job on the weekends was to mate horses.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And he had to go to work with a raincoat on.  And his whole time, I swear to God.  Because I, I don't know, but I hear, like, when they, when they, you know what, it's, it's unbelievable.  Well, it's, uh.  It's everywhere, and there's a lot of it.  It's just calamity.  Is it really?  Yeah, yeah.  We, we used to breed horses.  Yeah.  Have you seen a horse just ejaculate?  We didn't do it like they do it now. 
[01:33:00]  It's very technical and stuff.  Right.  In a lab, you know.  We just threw a horse that was in heat together with a stallion, and they would go at it.  And a lot of times, uh, the, the horse would miss.  But horses just, they're completely premature.  The horse would hop up on the other one.  The stallion would hop up on the mare.  And if the horse's cock just, like, hit the thigh of the other horse, and it would just  go spraying everywhere.  And there's a lot of it, right? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, because this kid would, he had his special raincoat, and his whole job was to make sure  he got that, you know, penis entire.  Right, and he'd try to put it in.  And he's, he would, he would get covered with freaking horse.  They'd get all worked up, and unless it's in, you know, if it's not in, it's going to  go everywhere.  What a job.  So they would go crazy.  You know, because, you know, in college, man, you're all hungover and tired, and this  was his job, you know, after maybe two hours sleep, he would get his raincoat and go down  to the horse farm to mate horses.  Yeah, that's right, old boy. 
[01:34:00]  You're going to get a piece of her, aren't you?  Oh, calm down.  Oh, hey, hey.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I'm not going to race him, though.  I'm just going to jerk him off.  Very good.  Just going to clean his sheath.  So, all right, Dreamweaver, the horses are ready for your little date, right?  Yeah.  Oh, dude.  All right.  Getting all, getting all excited for my date.  Cleaned, cleaned the horse up.  And now I was riding up into the hills that, that we used to ride up in all the time and 
[01:34:30]  take care of the cattle and everything.  So, I wanted to look the part.  So, I had my western attire on, Opie.  And I was the little cowboy.  Oh, my God.  I had the hat.  I had the boots, spurs, chaps, jeans, and a western style shirt.  That's how I used to dress.  Did you have a gay video crew following you?  I know.  You know, in any other circumstance, that is very gay. 
[01:35:00]  But I was actually doing the work.  I was a working cowboy out there, out west.  And I want to look the part.  I had my rifle.  I had saddlebags with our lunch in it and stuff.  And I even had a bedroll.  Just in case.  Just in case.  Just in case old Dreamweaver decided to be a goer.  I had everything I needed.  And what I planned on doing, I had all these fantasies going on in my head. 
[01:35:30]  She was weaving dreams on me.  I was going to go out there.  I was going to shoot a rabbit.  And then skin it.  And cook it right there.  Like I knew how to do.  Like I'd done plenty of times when we used to go out camping and stuff.  And I was going to cook her a rabbit.  And you were going to live off the land.  Live off the land.  Just me and Dreamweaver up in the head.  And I was thinking this.  And this was what I was going to do.  A skinny 13-year-old kid.  Oh.  Pull out my six-gun.  Yeah.  Look at me. 
[01:36:00]  I just bagged us a rabbit, Dreamweaver.  And you're so hot.  Oh, yeah.  I was completely like.  I had been thinking about this all day.  How long had you been talking to her?  Probably about two weeks, I guess.  About two weeks just talking.  So we kind of got to know each other and everything.  And she was into horses.  And I thought this was going to be a great first date.  I was going to show what a man I was.  I even got some homebrew.  It was this stuff that the Mexicans used to make at a stable that was real close. 
[01:36:30]  They used to take these bourbon barrels that they would get from the distillery, fill  it up with three gallons of water, and then roll it around every day for about a month.  And when you poured it out, you got a gallon would come out of just the strongest fuck-you-up  liquid I've ever had in my life.  Moonshine.  Excite some of that.  Maybe get Dreamweaver a little, you know, get a little tipsy and stuff.  Drink it out of those tin cups like the old West guys used to do. 
[01:37:00]  Want to snort?  You know, keep it with the old West motif.  Well, get the horses.  Go to where the river splits there in San Juan Capistrano.  And I'm waiting for her.  Got there early, you know.  You got butterflies in your stomach, right?  I did.  I'm still looking at everything, making sure everything's okay.  And off in the distance, I see a figure walking down the riverbed.  And that must have been Dreamweaver. 
[01:37:30]  Here she comes.  But it's just a speck coming.  I can't quite figure it out yet.  Maybe the sun's in your eye a little bit.  I'm looking.  You see the silhouette, right?  I'm looking.  She came in out of the rising sun.  Yeah, I was looking.  As she's getting closer, I'm thinking, well, maybe the heat is, you know, spreading things out.  You know how the heat waves on the highway make the highway look a little wider?  A little higher, yeah. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It could get like that.  Was it cold?  Maybe she had a Parker on.  Maybe she had something, even though it was a very hot day.  Right.  Oh, God.  No.  No.  And as she got closer, I can't explain my disappointment.  I think I can explain it with this.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Dude, the disappointment is really coming back to me now.  I'm kind of remembering how disappointing it was.  I had this image of this beautiful girl that was going to come and ride with me. 
[01:38:30]  And I swear, I was going to take the ride first through town and then up into the hills just so people could see me with the girl I imagined I was going to be with.  It was going to end with puppet sex.  It was just going to be crazy.  You were going to just having sex on the riverbed.  Having sex like the Marlboro Man.  I was just going to be there with this hot girl in a bedroll with a campfire up against  a tree and they're looking over it. 
[01:39:00]  Sure.  And guns and whiskey and broads and horses and fucking a manly night with my hot, broad Dreamweaver.  The disappointment set in at 100 yards.  I saw her big, fat head and her big, fat face and her greasy, stringy hair and her loose-fitting, bunt-ridden jeans.  Bunt-ridden jeans. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  The bunt wore away the jeans like your knees were.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A little frayed at the bunt.  Yeah.  I can't tell you.  Because I had built it up to something so huge in my head, the disappointment was such a letdown.  Did you fake it to like a big smile like, hey, glad to meet you.  I don't even think I did.  I don't even think I did.  And perhaps she was just as disappointed thinking I was this Marlboro man. 
[01:40:00]  I was, you know, Mr. Macho.  And there I am with my, you know, little skinny arms and, you know, trying to pull off the cowboy thing.  But, you know, she was fat.  It was very disappointing.  So, what did you do?  Well, I tried to say, hey, how you doing, with a big smile and stuff.  But it was just like, hey, what's up? 
[01:40:30]  I think the person that was more pissed was the horse that she had a ride.  Looked at me like, thanks.  Thanks so much.  What, was the Clydesdale busy?  I said, you know, how you doing?  She hops on the horse.  No ride through town.  No proud ride through town as I show off this girl.  I imagine just hair blowing as people looked up and went, wow, what a beautiful girl on that horse. 
[01:41:00]  And turned directly around, went down the river, up into the hills.  Took a ride for about, I'll be honest, 45 minutes.  That was it.  No bedroll.  No fire.  No hunting rabbit.  No sex.  I'd have had a bag of moose to feed that bitch.  Believe me.  No rabbit.  She'd have ate the rabbit whole, fur and all. 
[01:41:30]  One bite.  Darn her.  Done.  Yeah.  And none of that.  None of that fun stuff I imagine.  45 minutes.  I just went like, ah, we better get heading in.  And I think she even asked why.  And I said something.  The horse, oh, I think the one you're on was coming up lame or something.  And, you know, I had to get it back early.  But I had a great time.  Thanks.  Dropped it back off where the river splits and took the horse back. 
[01:42:00]  It was disappointing.  I remember my father was all happy and stuff.  He was like, hey, how'd it go?  You know?  It's like, oh, dad, she was a fat broad.  And she said something that Jimmy said the other day.  You know, sometimes you just got to go hogging.  That's what dad said?  Yeah.  You know, he always had kind words of wisdom like that.  You truly had the greatest dad.  You really had the greatest dad.  And that was...  You ever saw her again, did you?  Nope.  I think I saw her once more.  I never, never called.  Like, I'd be on the CB, you know.  Hey, it's the Wrangler looking for flying fingers. 
[01:42:30]  Wrangler looking for flying fingers.  You out there flying fingers?  Hey, Wrangler, it's the Dreamweaver.  Wrangler out.  You just blew it off totally?  Dreamweaver, Wrangler.  You got your ears on?  Yeah.  Unfortunately for you, I had my eyes on that day.  And I saw what a fat pig you were.  Yeah.  Hey, Dreamweaver, you got your pork chops on?  Wow.  Yeah, so I saw her one day, one night at a party at another stable. 
[01:43:00]  And she was singing around a campfire with a bunch of other people.  And we kind of just traded a passing glance.  But I think, you know, she knew that I was disappointed.  I couldn't even hide it because of what I built up.  No one would have lived up to that.  Yes, Jimmy?  Nothing.  I'm just empathizing with you.  Yeah.  That stinks.  All right, why don't we take a break?  Yeah, that does stink.  Who was that girl that was in Playboy years ago?  Heft's like first real celebrity chick. 
[01:43:30]  Barbie Benton.  Remember Barbie Benton?  I know her name.  Where was she from?  She was just, I don't know, kind of hot.  And she was in Playboy.  Brunette, centerfold.  Yeah.  She was in Playboy.  That was my image.  It was Barbie Benton was going to show up.  And if we'll find a picture, I'm sure we will.  During commercials or something, pop one up or someone send a link.  Instead, Kirstie Alley showed up.  Yes.  Yes.  That was it.  I expected Barbie Benton.  I got Kirstie Alley.  And there it goes. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Why don't we take a break?  Breaker, breaker to the Wrangler.  I know.  It's the Dreamweaver and I got my ears on.  Breaker, breaker.  I look a lot like Barbie Benton on the radio.  Where's Dreamweaver, boy?  You're a hunting rabbit?  I want a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it snappy.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  And then there she came out.  Yoo-hoo, Wrangler. 
[01:44:30]  Thank you, nice lady.  Nice ass.  Oh, fat pig.  All right.  Well, we've been on the radio for an hour.  Why don't we take a break?  Anthony, I think we're going to start playing some Christmas stuff here and there, right?  Why not?  Yeah, why not?  Everyone else is.  Are we going all Christmas songs?  I know there's three or four channels on XM Satellite Radio dedicated to Christmas music.  You can find them on your own. 
[01:45:00]  I don't really care.  I'm just still disappointed now that I think that.  I know.  I could see your face.  You really hurt me back then.  Well, speaking of flying fingers, she has a Christmas song, Police Got My Car.  Ah, yes.  We'll play this going into break and we'll continue.  So check this out.  Hey, man, you want to go out and get a beer and burn one or something?  I can't, man.  The police, they got my car.  What do you mean the police got your car?  Just what I said.  The police got my car.  The police got your car? 
[01:45:30]  You stupid ass, the police, they got my car.  Dude, I can't believe the police got your car.  Ah, shut up, man.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Well, I was driving home from the bar.  Dude, that really sucks.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  The police got my car.  Well, I was driving drunk from the bar. 
[01:46:00]  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  You stupid dick.  I want my Chevy for Christmas, so I can go drink at the bar.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  You stupid dick.  I want my Chevy for Christmas, so I can go get drunk at the bar.  Police got my car. 
[01:46:30]  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  Well, I was driving getting stoned in South Central.  Dude, that don't ride.  Shut up, man.  Police got my car.  The police got my car.  The police got your car?  The police got my car while I was driving home drunk from the bar.  You got a deewee, man.  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas. 
[01:47:00]  I told my bitch I'd have my Chevy for Christmas, so we could get drunk at the bar.  You stupid dick, I want my Chevy for Christmas.  Who's dick, man?  I want my friggin' 60 Chevy for Christmas.  Son of a bitch, I want my Chevy for Christmas, so we could go get drunk at the bar.  Calm down, man.  Ah, shut up, man.  The very worst of the Opie and Anthony F.U. Life.  Yeah, I'd like to give a giant fuck you to the town of Hempstead, lazy-ass fucking workers. 
[01:47:30]  Yesterday, I'm standing outside and I'm pouring fucking rain with my bare hands clearing out the fucking storm drains  that for the last seven years I've been playing to the fucking town for to clean up.  Otherwise, my house is gonna get fucking flooded, and there I am after a 12-hour shift out there doing their fucking job.  Fuck you, town of Hempstead.  You're a bunch of lazy fucking cogsucks.  And fuck you to my mother-in-law, too, because she's a fucking whining pain in the ass and got my kids sick, too. 
[01:48:00]  Fuck you to the lady's eye.  Like, the bitch ain't gonna clean herself up until she's ready to, and it's very apparent she ain't gonna.  So, you know, I just fucking cut her loose, guys.  That's all I can say.  Just cut her fucking loose.  Yeah, I'd like to have this fuck you go out to Steve and Ben or whoever put together the holiday worst of.  You guys should have just started playing the fucking second week on.  You had time to play almost every hour of every show instead of giving us one good solid hour and repeating it 400 times. 
[01:48:30]  Fuck you.  I'd like to say fuck you to my mother.  She should have kept her legs closed because she brought me into this world, and I'm not enjoying it.  Fuck you, mom.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  Well, fuck you very much.  We're jealous of women sexually.  Women have that superior endurance.  What's the biggest difference sexually?  It's the energy levels right after sex.  Girls get all energetic.  My girlfriend wants to cook stuff.  She's got a cake in the oven. 
[01:49:00]  She's roasting a pig on a spit that she killed with her own bare hands.  You know, she's painting the house, raking leaves.  Meanwhile, I'm at the hospital.  My blood pressure is three over one.  I'm on life support systems.  The doctor's like, he came three times?  That means irreversible brain damage.  Guys have no energy after sex, do they?  I'm surprised rapists don't get caught every time.  So, officer, how'd you apprehend the suspect? 
[01:49:30]  Well, he chased him 50 feet and he passed out.  Where's the woman?  She's in the woods doing jumping jacks.  After I have sex, my legs are like a newborn calf.  You know, I'm in the kitchen in my underwear trying to make a sandwich.  Look out the window.  She's put in a built-in pool.  Yeah, is 80 feet deep enough, honey?  What did I shoot into you, cracks?  Sit down for crying out. 
[01:50:00]  We'll have sex tomorrow night and clean the garage.  And I mean, after a good blowjob, I need a walker.  Only one thing got me out of college.  High school.  That high school was tough.  And grammar school, I couldn't spell at all.  I used to miss words like posse. 
[01:50:30]  And count.  I always left the U out.  Teacher gave me 100, though.  He said, it could have been worse.  The game that was born on the radio now joins the next generation of radio.  XM Satellite Radio is now the official satellite service of Major League Baseball.

[01:52:00]  Evil.  And loving it.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I almost broke my vagina.  Drink until she's pretty.  It's a freak show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Soar!  Are you bathing?  Soar!  Are you bathing?  I'm sacking what I was going to tell you.  Oh, that's hilarious.  We'll explain in a second. 
[01:52:30]  Spreading the O&A virus across America.  Yes.  Thank you for helping us out with that, by the way.  Spreading the virus up the neck, chest, ears, head, eyes.  And a big hi to everyone that turned on their XM satellite radio since we last did a live show.  A lot of catching up to do, you people.  The show getting more gooder every day.  And our listeners sending in stuff that we used to play.  I think we've explained this a few times.  When we got fired two and a half years ago, or canceled, whatever you want to call it. 
[01:53:00]  You know, they locked our office, changed the locks, and we weren't allowed to get any of our stuff.  So we were kicked to the curb with nothing.  Absolutely nothing.  Kicked to the curb.  And it was a lot of stuff that I personally collected over the years doing radio.  And they kept it all, Anthony.  And slowly but surely, the listeners are sending in stuff that we used to play to help the show out.  Thank you.  I got something that's going to make you laugh.  We finally got it.  Let me just play this really fast.  It's a quickie. 
[01:53:30]  Come on.  Come on.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  All is right with the show, boys and girls.  I love that one.  This guy is a freaking lunatic. 
[01:54:00]  That was the HBO Bellevue special that they did.  Yeah.  And this guy, he would just walk around.  Over and over again.  Saying this.  Right.  All day long.  And then we have the other clip we used to play a lot from the guy when he first arrives  at Bellevue.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medication is that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Okay.  Go with me.  I hate this place. 
[01:54:30]  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  It's only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  Yeah, I've been here since yesterday.  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you some medication, okay?  The medications don't work.  I'll do it right back on your stretcher.  Nothing works here.  All right, I'm here.  I hate this place.  Okay.  Nothing works here.  Oh, my God.  It's tiring just to listen to.  And that's all the guy would say all day long.  He would just wander the halls saying that over and over and over again.  I've been here seven years. 
[01:55:00]  Being crazy looks like a pisser.  You're just in such a faraway place.  We will get that stuck in your head.  You will be reciting that.  Nothing works here.  You become a fan of this show.  You will recite that over and over again.  We will play that ad nauseum.  Why don't we save these idiots?  Just open an incinerator and let them walk into it.  Why are we wasting tax dollars on someone that says seven years?  Seven years.  Seven years.  I've been here seven years.  So now we can add that to the collection of things we used to have.  Thank you.  And now have again. 
[01:55:30]  So whoever sent that in, thank you very much.  Curse of the Bambino sent in some pictures of Barbie Benton.  Thank you very much.  Really brought back some memories.  And Liquid Ninja from New Brunswick, New Jersey, saying when Dreamweaver was saying  Breaker Breaker, she was referring to the ground beneath her.  Very funny.  We got a guy on the line.  He's going to give us the origins of these plastic nut things we were just talking about  20 minutes ago.  Dan in Ohio.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, dude. 
[01:56:00]  You figured somebody who was a Wrangler could figure out the origin of that nut thing there.  The origin?  The origin?  The origin.  Nothing works here.  These nuts have been here for seven years.  That's right.  That's right.  But the cattle haulers put them on the ass into their livestock trailer.  And old Norton should have figured that out since he's a truck driving man.  Dude, why do they do that, though?  Just to be silly?  Well, no.  They used to put the bell on the back end of there.  You know, like they followed a cow with a bell on it. 
[01:56:30]  Well, they came up with the idea that they followed the old bull into the feedlot.  You know, well, what do they see from the backside?  There's nuts hanging down there.  So the old cattle haulers started hanging bull's nuts on there.  And then it caught on.  And so they started making them small, put on cars.  And next time you see a livestock trailer, which you probably won't see in New York,  but, you know, next time you see one and your travels there, Mr. Norton, you check it out. 
[01:57:00]  I want to hit you over the head with one of these things.  I know.  I want to bludgeon you.  One of these is blue.  Why are they blue?  In case Paul Bunyan's ox comes along?  They got them all colors.  They got them all fucking colors.  They got them yellow.  They got them red.  They got them black.  It is the stupidest idea I've ever heard of.  It's a fucking goat roper idea.  Those nuts are ridiculous.  What do you expect from goat ropers?  I mean, what do you know?  They invent stupid.  Thank you, buddy.  I'm going to hang out, buddy.  We've got to move on. 
[01:57:30]  I mean, they come up with the stupidest things for your car.  Do you remember, this goes back maybe 10 years ago, where there's this little thing you put on your dashboard,  and if a car pisses you off, it makes noises like you're shooting them and stuff with lasers.  It's like, remember that?  Yeah, that'll help.  They come up with these wacky things.  How about the sign?  Like, the sign that said, you know, hey, you cut me off.  And you're supposed to flip to the appropriate sign and hold it up.  And it was shaped like a middle finger, like you're flipping the bird. 
[01:58:00]  That's great.  Yeah, really good.  You're going to hold those up.  You know, it also works well in traffic like that?  A semi-automatic weapon.  Yeah.  And you just kill the savage in the taxi that was cut across six lanes to pick up a fare.  Well, we've got to talk to Club Soda Kenny, everyone.  Kenny!  Hello.  Good morning.  How's everybody?  Hi, Kenny.  What's going on?  You're a big TV star today.  Well, you know, I owe it out to you guys.  You guys are an inspiration to me. 
[01:58:30]  Oh.  Are we going to have to protect you now?  No, sir.  That's not the way it works.  See, because the most talented and the most handsome, they get protection.  I heard you did a little gig on HBO this weekend, Kenny.  Oh, yes, I did.  Our friend Jim Florentine was nice enough to put me in the show.  That's very cool.  And what did you guys do?  We got the audio of it here.  Really?  Yeah.  But you got to set it up because it was a TV bit.  I was in three scenes. 
[01:59:00]  I actually spoke in two of them and then just looked handsome in the third.  It just looked handsome.  And they didn't get you to skip?  No, no.  There wasn't enough time to skip, you know, because, you know, Bob Costas and Dan Marino,  they want time on their own show.  Of course they do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So they don't know.  They didn't tap into the true talent yet.  Well, I got the audio clip.  I don't know.  You're watching the game or something.  And then I think Jim's commenting about your eyes or something. 
[01:59:30]  You're the annoying relative.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like annoyances when you're trying to watch the game.  And it was like different bits.  There was like broads babbling in the background and, you know, kids fighting in front of the TV.  And then I was like the annoying guy that was like wouldn't stop talking.  All right.  You want to play the audio here?  I can't play it.  No, I was asking the guys that I do this radio show with.  I think you should play it.  All right, let's play it.  This is Club Soda Kenny from HBO Inside the NFL over the week. 
[02:00:00]  What, Wednesday?  Yeah, it premiered Wednesday night.  Then it replayed every day throughout the weekend.  Look at you.  Are you getting recognized now, Kenny?  Recognized?  No.  And we didn't play your theme song today.  Do you have it ready?  We still haven't made it.  All right.  So now you have to do it again live.  Go ahead.  All right.  Here comes Club Soda.  He's big and stupid.  Here comes Club Soda. 
[02:00:30]  Skipping down the lane.  Here comes Clubby.  He's big and stupid.  So let's all say hello to Club Soda.  You're dropping the Kenny part?  Kenny.  There's like a pause.  I'm not feeling it.  You're not feeling it today?  No, no.  Yeah, we think you did it a lot better last week.  You know what?  Now you're trying too hard.  Yeah.  I have to seriously sit down and commit and write some lyrics. 
[02:01:00]  Is that it?  Yeah, that's what I got to do because I'm not good at improv.  Well, the problem is you got to learn how to write first.  And sing also.  And sing.  All right.  Well, let's listen to the clip.  Here's Kenny from HBO Inside the NFL.  Hey, how you doing?  Good.  You're a comedian guy, right?  Yeah.  Come on, tell me a joke.  I'm watching the game, all right?  I know, but it'll be funny.  You tell a joke, everybody will laugh.  You ever get this?  The annoying relative that doesn't want to watch the game just talk?  Well, this is how you solve this.  Do you want to hear something funny? 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  You've got beautiful eyes.  I'm going to check on the potatoes.  Was it a little skit?  Yeah, it was like a little thing on the couch, me and him.  A little skit?  Yeah.  I like the fact that you had to check on the potatoes.  Yeah.  I was going to say potato rivers, but they didn't like that.  Yeah.  But anyway.  Well, okay.  You should have seen. 
[02:02:00]  I didn't know he was going to come out to me like that, like you've got beautiful eyes.  I thought you would be happy.  Oh, yeah.  You should have seen what happened when the camera was shut off.  That's just kidding.  All right, Kenny.  Very good.  Congratulations on your HBO thing.  Well, thank you very much.  You know, you guys truly are the only people that pay attention to me.  What?  And I appreciate that.  All right.  We're going to make you a star, Kenny.  Thank you. 
[02:02:30]  Did you have like a nice Thanksgiving thing?  It was all right, Kenny.  It was all right.  Beautiful.  It was just all right this year, but we got through it.  All right.  Good.  Yours was good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did the family thing.  You know.  You know how enjoyable that is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I ate with Bob Kelly, and I had to look at him and look at the turkey and realize they  were both shaped the exact same.  Thanks, Kenny, for bailing me out of that almost horrendous bomb.  Oh, boy.  He is terrific.  All right, Kenny.  Get the hell out of here. 
[02:03:00]  All right, boys.  Take care.  I'll see you soon.  There he goes.  Club soda, Kenny.  Bye, Jack.  Bye.  All right.  Let's say hi to a trucker.  Chuck?  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Hey.  We're going to attempt to talk to a trucker.  We've been blowing off the truckers lately because we realize you guys are very lonely on the highways.  Like you talk.  And you really like to talk.  I don't like to talk that much.  All right.  I just like, hey, I got a theme song for a club, sort of Kenny.  How about that Alice Cooper song called Hey Stupid?  Hey Stupid.  That's not a bad idea.  I don't know that one. 
[02:03:30]  But, Anthony, I can go on yourself that day.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit, Mike.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's bad.  Punch out, Wrangler.  Call back on CB.  We're not even going to attempt that one.  Skipper, another trucker.  Go ahead, Skipper.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  I'll tell you, man.  When you tell me about that Dreamweaver story just brought back memories when I first got  into trucking and we're riding along and riding with this other guy behind his truck so I  don't get lost and everything.  Well, here comes this beautiful voice. 
[02:04:00]  Hey, fellas, this is Eminem.  Oh, man.  I ain't had sex in two weeks or so.  And she's talking about, you won't melt my hands, but you can melt my mouth.  I'm like, man.  She got us all worked up.  We finally pulled over to the truck stop.  She's about 250 pounds.  A lazy eye.  Wiry hair about five inches off her head.  We were like, oh, no, I'm not Skipper.  My name is Wrangler. 
[02:04:30]  So I'm on my own.  Yeah, I mean, I think the Internet has proven it that they're just messes.  Yeah, a lot of messes.  Hot chicks aren't hanging out on the CB radio or the Internet.  Right.  See?  Should have known.  They're just not.  Back then, I didn't know, though.  That's the 70s.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And CB, you know, I kind of know.  Can I put a request in?  Yeah.  Yeah, I could add about 20 cents to your fee.  Give old Jimmy 20 cents a fee or whatnot and pay for his addiction. 
[02:05:00]  I got the same addiction he's got.  Oh, the whores?  Oh, yeah.  I actually, it's funny.  You tell me a fact that I completely forgot about this until, as you're talking,  I remembered it when I was in Pittsburgh one time doing a gig.  I was online, and I found a massage ad for a girl, and I actually drove probably about  25 minutes from the condo I was staying in, and she was probably 300 pounds, and I really  think that there was something wrong with her mentally because she sat on the edge of  the bed, and she was rocking back and forth, and she was opening and closing her hands 
[02:05:30]  in a weird clenching fashion as we spoke.  Big fat girl just kind of clenching her hands and rocking back and forth.  That's a little weird.  And I gave her, I think, $60, and she blew me.  Maybe that's why.  That's true.  So you weren't concerned that she was a little strange?  No, I'm not even kidding.  I really didn't think she was crazy.  She was like a fat, retarded girl.  I might give her like $60 for a hundred.  Oh, she listened to the Madame Butterfly and turned the light on and off?  No, no, no.  I don't remember what she did.  I just remember it was awful and toothy. 
[02:06:00]  You didn't say, hey, perhaps, you know, you should leave.  No, because I was already there.  It was late.  It was like 2 in the morning in Pittsburgh.  I'm like, what else?  How more depressing could this be?  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Skipper.  You're welcome.  Bye, Skipper.  Or please get a nickname, by the way, that suits somebody over the age of seven.  Speaking of whores, Craigslist.  Craigslist.  I wouldn't know about Craigslist anymore.  I'm done with it.  Uh-oh.  What is this?  No more whores, man.  Oh, boy.  Here he goes.  No more.  This is sad when you say this, because it looks like you're really trying. 
[02:06:30]  Wait, can you play the Hulk music?  No, you're going to fail.  I want to hear the Hulk music.  I'm in shock.  Why?  Let's get into this a little bit.  Hulk music.  You don't know where the Hulk music is?  Well, I could find it, I think.  You sure?  Look at all the pages you got there.  I got pages and pages.  And pages of stuff.  I know.  I got the first three memorized, but.  You really do, huh?  After that.  Uh-oh.  Oh, look at this young go-getter.  There's a young man with a good build walking through. 
[02:07:00]  He does have a Clemens vibe to him.  Oh, I got it.  Never mind.  You got it?  Boss has it.  Ah, there it is.  All right, Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  Confessing today on the Opie and Anthony show that he's done with Craigslist and whores.  Yes.  What happened?  Nothing.  I'm just wasting way too much money.  And I realize that everyone I'm having sex with, I'm paying for.  I'm tired of it.  Everyone.  Dude, it's awful.  When was the last time you had sex that you didn't pay for?  Probably this week.  Last week.  But, I mean, let's say 90%. 
[02:07:30]  Are you really swearing off of a...  I'm going to try, man.  Yeah, I realize how much money I've been wasting.  I swear to God, it bugged me because, like, I don't hear from these girls ever.  Not that I expect a love connection, but it's like...  Well, you're being serious.  They're pay-for whores.  Yeah, but I figured that they would, like, want to come over, even though I'd have to  pay for it.  Oh, my God.  Even though I'd have to pay them.  Yeah, that's crazy, too.  Nah, no.  So, I'm, like, done with it.  I'm sick of these dumb bitches.  I'm confused.  What?  They come over and do their thing, and you pay them, but you expect a little more after 
[02:08:00]  they're gone?  Like a little phone call or maybe a little email?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not an off-the-clock thing.  I don't want a relationship, but just, like, that they would call and go, hey, I haven't  seen you in a while.  Let me come over.  For money.  Not for free.  I don't think they work that way.  Well, you know, well...  It's like the deli guy saying they're knocking on your door.  Would you like a sandwich?  You're hoping, even though you paid for the sex, that they thought you were so cool and had  a nice personality or something that they're calling to see if they can come back.  Yeah, or just...  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, boy.  Let me just... 
[02:08:30]  Are you being serious?  Yeah, let me correct Anthony's example.  When the deli guy takes a dump on your chest, then it kind of makes things a little more  intimate.  If he drops one of his logs into the deli slicer and serves it to you...  Right.  You have a log on wheat.  I didn't think about that.  So you really think you're a zero because the women aren't calling you to ask if they  could come over so you could pay them for sex?  It's not even that.  It just annoys me.  It's not like I'm depressed about it.  I'm annoyed at myself.  Like, what do you... 
[02:09:00]  Why would you even call this...  This big pig could call you back at least and say, let me come over, even if it's just  for money.  Because I'm an easy trick.  I'm an easy trick.  How much money do you spend on hookers a year?  I don't know.  I think you've been low-balling a little bit.  Probably.  But I haven't even thought about it.  I didn't want to think about it.  I don't want to know.  You once said 20,000 on the show a year.  Did I really?  Yeah.  That was a wonderful understatement.  Really?  Yeah.  Of course.  It's more than 20,000 a year?  Maybe not every year, no.  It's been a lot this year.  Jimmy's one of these guys that everything he's involved in that gives him any little ounce 
[02:09:30]  of pleasure becomes an addiction that he then has to spend time and effort breaking  at some point in his life.  Anything that seems to give you enjoyment becomes an addiction.  And I just ruin it.  And you wreck it.  And then it has to be stopped.  Everything.  You can't dabble in something.  You're an all-or-nothing kind of guy.  Yeah.  She's an addicted sociopath.  But it's like once in a while you want to go on nice dates and have – I mean, I've 
[02:10:00]  been single for a while.  So once in a while you want to go on a regular date and have a nice chick.  It's like, ugh.  I'm such a pervert.  I'm annoyed with myself.  I'm whacking off and I'm not horny.  It's like, what am I doing?  And you bring that into relationships with girls.  You bring that – the fact that you're a pervert.  Well, I'm all right with women.  I kind of respect their boundaries and stuff.  But I kind of want it immediately.  Like if I go on a date and the mule isn't in the mouth, well, there goes the end of  that potential relationship.  Yeah, but that's not what it's about.  Right.  That's not what a relationship – I think you seem to want. 
[02:10:30]  I don't know if you're looking for it or anything.  But it seems that you want something more than just paying for whores to come over.  But you don't want to do anything that has to do with a real relationship.  Like not getting the hog in your mouth in the first five minutes.  Yeah, like putting in the time.  I'm weird with girls.  I have crushes.  If I like a girl, I have a crush on her and then I'm like, it's hard for me to be  sexual with her.  You have that whole complex where I can't be a pig with someone I really –  See, I got this thing.  When I see a girl, you know, the first time, if she has sex with me, I get really bummed out 
[02:11:00]  actually.  I mean, the sex most likely was good and stuff.  And then I'm thinking, oh, man, she's a whore.  No, I don't –  Like when I see someone new and they don't – you know, we don't have sex the first  date, that rocks.  And you're disappointed if you don't get sex on the first date with someone you like?  It's got to be organic.  If someone's holding out on me just to hold out, it's like, all right, fucking Mae West,  beat it.  But that 1940s attitude, it irritates me.  You showed me. 
[02:11:30]  Out.  But if it's just not organically happening, that's fine.  So how many days without sex?  Oh, I don't know.  Without hooker sex?  I would actually have to stop and think about it.  It all becomes like one long blur.  Wow.  One awful –  That's never good.  No.  Anything becomes one long blur.  One awful blur.  So I don't even know.  We've got a couple people with comments.  Kurt from Jersey.  What's up, Kurt?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  Hey, little Jimmy.  How are you, Kurt?  Hey, listen.  I don't think you want to give up your addiction.  I just think you need maybe hoards with a better sales department. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, maybe.  That's true.  Or a prostitute who can pull off a little acting once in a while with a phone.  But I'm not looking for freebies, and I'm not deluded into thinking there's any real love  between me and this girl.  No.  I don't mean it like that.  It's like when Amex calls every so often.  Hey, how you doing?  It's American Express.  We have this new card.  Yes.  That's available to you.  And it's like, I've been using Amex for a while.  That's nice that they would call.  Yep.  Absolutely.  That's what Jimmy's looking for, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Frankie in New York. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, Boo Boo.  How are you?  Hi, Cuddles.  I'm sad.  Oh, sweetheart.  Hey, did you leave the horse because they didn't make you dinner and tuck you in and do the  laundry and –  No, they don't have to do all the things.  At the end of the night.  No, no, I don't need all of that intimacy.  I mean, you know, I'm not deluded about what it is, but –  But they're whores.  They're not wives.  You know what I mean?  You pay them and then they go about their merry way.  That's the beauty of it.  No, you're right.  Jim wants a girl, whether he pays for her or not, to just be interested in him.  Yes.  Get a girlfriend.  In some level. 
[02:13:00]  What's that?  To get a girlfriend.  Stop paying them, then.  Yeah.  They come back because they don't feel like a dirty piece of the trash.  I know technically you're right, but it's just like I kind of want a girlfriend.  I kind of want that –  I was going to say, I hang out with Jim a lot.  He definitely wants a girlfriend.  You think so?  Oh, yeah.  All right, boo-boo.  Punch it out.  You guys rock.  Bye, fella.  All right.  Here's a guy that fell in love with a hooker.  How do you do that?  Oh, man.  Definitely, I can say he can do that.  Rock bottom, the trucker.  What's up, rock bottom?  What's up, fellas?  How are you, buddy?  How's my phone sound? 
[02:13:30]  All right?  It's marginal, but working.  Yeah, we'll go with it for a little while.  Go ahead.  True.  No, I just want to tell Jimmy Norton there that, you know, I'm out here trucking all  the time, and I run into whores all the time, and I guess I'm a little of a player.  I just run into a whore.  I mean, that's what I love, man.  So, I know it's a fucked up situation, because I think about it, and it's like, damn, she's  a whore, but, I mean, she calls me all the time, and she's telling me she loves me, and  we hook up, and I don't have to pay her, and I guess it's a cool situation, you know 
[02:14:00]  what I'm saying?  So, there is hope out there, Jimmy Norton.  Wait, so she's not playing you?  She really says you can now have sex with me, and you don't have to pay me anymore, because  I'm into you, too?  Yeah, yeah, man.  You know what I'm saying?  She calls me and tells me if she's going to be up here, down there, wherever.  And is she still banging other guys, though?  No, well, I'm there.  You know what I'm saying?  We hang out all night.  She kicks it in my truck.  You know, we just chill all night, so I got to leave, and she got to leave, and you know 
[02:14:30]  what I'm saying?  Wait, so you've definitely fallen in love with her?  Shit.  Man, it's been like since, shit, like six years I've been in love, and I think, you know,  I'm feeling it, you know?  All right, you're feeling it, but in the back of your head, you're thinking, oh, my God,  when she's not with me, she's still doing her hooking, right?  Well, she's still got to make her bread, you know what I'm saying?  Just like I got to keep on trucking and make my money, you know?  I'm better doing that, so she needs to keep on making her money, you know? 
[02:15:00]  How much does that bother you, though?  Oh, of course, deep down inside, it bothers me, you know what I'm saying?  But it's not like she's my woman, like my wife, and I could tell her, hey, look, I don't  want you fucking around with nobody else, you know?  She's doing what she's doing, I guess, you know, if things really do, you know, work out  the way they're supposed to, then she'll give it up.  And she says that she's willing to give it up once we get established and shit gets,  you know?  Established.  The way it's supposed to be, but no doubt, in the back of my head, I am thinking, damn, 
[02:15:30]  she is a whore, though, you know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, it is a fucked up situation, because I'm a young cat, and I go clubbing a lot, and  I party, you know what I'm saying?  And I meet a lot, a lot of girls going to the clubs, and out here, fucking around with  all the hoes, and at the truck stops, fucking around with the girls in the fuel desk, or  whatever.  I mean, I ran through a whole bunch of girls, and man, it just clicked.  It just clicked between us, you know?  And unfortunately, she's a fucking slutty whore, but, I mean, the sex is fucking awesome. 
[02:16:00]  But I love her, man.  Of course the sex is awful.  She's a professional.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  All right.  But I, I mean, I'm fucking so good that I make her bust a nut every time, so I guess  that's another reason why she fell in love, so.  All right.  Your time is up.  Truckers, time is up.  Thank you, Rock Bottom.  I was thinking we need something to cut the truckers off.  Give them the old horn.  I was thinking maybe we bring back the Academy Award music. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, that would be good.  We need that, yeah.  We need some more Academy Award music.  You truckers, I gotta say it again.  You guys love to talk when you call this program.  They will just, because that's nothing for him.  Yeah, that was just a quick little chit-chat.  Relative to truckers, that's like nothing.  That's nothing.  They're used to miles and miles going by, and they're still on the horn.  All right.  Pat, a lot of truckers checking in today.  Pat, let's go, buddy.  Hey, I promise I'll keep it short.  I just wanted to point out to Jimmy that even at $20,000 a year, his hookers are still cheaper  than my ex-wife. 
[02:17:00]  You know what?  It's not really even a money issue with me, because I'm a single guy.  I don't spend that much on it, but you can waste a lot more buying a car to impress a  chick.  We've talked about that.  So yeah, I know what you're saying.  I agree with you.  But this girl did everything that your dad wanted.  She did some of the stuff you're into, and she just turned into the eternal money that  I'll be paying off for 20 years.  You're better off the way it is.  Yeah, maybe.  I miss certain parts of relationships, though.  There's certain things I do miss.  There's certain nice things you like. 
[02:17:30]  It's like, all right, I've gotten laid enough in my life.  Sometimes you miss, and I'm too open about it.  I know that's my problem with chicks.  I'm very open about it.  You're like everyone else.  You want a girl to like you for you.  And because you're paying for it, you know they're not there for you.  But it's also, I write on my blog, you know, all this stuff I put, and it's like, ugh.  I mean, that makes it hard for Bob Kelly.  He's like, what do you expect, dude?  Look at the stuff you tell people.  I'm like, yeah, it's a point well taken.  But you can't stop.  I won't ever stop.  No, I'm going to not be funny just to get laid.  I can't do that either.  That's how you are.  All right, let's say hi to Todd.  Hey, Todd.  Hey, what's going on, fellas? 
[02:18:00]  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Hey, I met this guy who's a truck driver at a truck stop.  Married a hooker out of a truck stop.  He married a hooker?  Hooker from a truck stop.  A hooker out of a truck stop.  A lounge lizard?  No, what are they called?  A lot lizard.  A lot lizard?  Yep.  That's crazy.  But it's a job moving to Delaware and everything.  Because in the back of your mind, I mean, guys in general wonder.  And can you imagine?  You married a hooker, you got to be thinking, what is she doing while I'm trying to make a living?  Hey, that's just crazy as hell. 
[02:18:30]  All right.  All right.  I mean, they are people.  You can fall in love with a call girl or whatever, but it's just like most of the times  they're not willing to get out of the business.  Have you done that, Jimmy?  No, but...  You've fallen for one of those.  Never did.  I never...  Have I?  Nah, I can think of a couple over the...  Like, even recent history that I really like, though.  Like, oh.  But the problem is they're such dummies, some of these girls.  Yeah.  It's like, do you understand what a sap I am?  If you had just...  If you a bitch had taken one acting lesson, you could have ruined me.  Oh, right, right.  Oh.  Yeah, they're just too stupid to know that they have a fist on the hook. 
[02:19:00]  Self-centered idiot.  That's hilarious.  You have no idea how close you were.  Oh.  One actor.  That's really funny.  Really.  If you just had just a little interest that wasn't...  If you didn't just ask for the check immediately and get out of Dodge...  Could have been so much more.  Superficial hole.  Drained your bank account.  Oh, buh-bye.  Buh-bye, comma.  Move the comma this way.  Buh-bye.  Jake, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Good morning to y'all.  Good morning.  You guys are killing me. 
[02:19:30]  Every truck driver you put on here is like some frickin' roof from Alabama.  Are you a driver?  Are you a truck driver?  I'm a truck driver.  All right.  I don't know.  I catch a shower every day.  I don't fuck whores.  I mean, I'm dumbfounded.  I mean, I know them guys are out here, man.  But all of us.  In general, most of you guys are just average guys making a living?  Yeah.  We don't even have southern accents.  It's amazing.  All right.  Don't you not?  All right.  Thank you, Jake.  And he kept it short. 
[02:20:00]  I don't believe he was a truck driver.  Yeah, I think he was just a business guy from Long Island going to work.  Jimmy, is it that you're getting a little older and you're starting to think, you know,  what it might be like to live your lifestyle as you get older and stay in it?  Nah, it's like, I don't know, man.  Occasionally you meet girls that you like, like just people I know.  It's like, I've had a few where it's like I kind of like them and it's like it just wasn't returned.  Like every guy has.  Every person has that. 
[02:20:30]  So it's almost like I can kind of, I want to kind of have like a nice thing once in a while.  I go out to eat.  It's like, I don't want to just get a load.  Can't just be a degenerate all the time.  Yeah, man.  I'm not, you know, I'm not particularly needy when it comes to that stuff.  I've been single for a while.  I know I could find a relationship, but it's like, you know, I get bored quick.  Someone's got to be funny.  They got to be smart.  You know what I mean?  Otherwise, you want to lay in bed with some dummy and talk to her.  Sit there and listen to just babble.  Yeah.  Fast Freddy did some math from Jamaica Station.  Seven times a week, which you're not paying for horse seven times a week. 
[02:21:00]  No, I'm not.  At least three times.  Okay, we'll go with three.  Times 150?  Yeah, we could do that.  He did the math problem.  Seven times 150 is $850 a week, which will bring you up to $45,900 a year.  Okay, that's too much.  Too much.  But you're about three, three and a half maybe?  Because that would...  Hard to say because some of them are more than 150.  Oh, poor Jimmy.  Look at Jimmy.  Oh, whatever.  It's what I'm doing.  I'm not feeling smart for myself.  It's what I'm doing.  Speaking of Craigslist, yeah, we saw this in the paper today.  Pete.  Hey. 
[02:21:30]  I was thinking Jimmy could use Craigslist and find a nice girl that needs a kidney for  a dying brother.  That's true.  I'll trade you my kidney for your box.  Yeah.  No?  What about poor Neil Diamond?  It's in the paper today.  What the hell is that?  His name is Neil Diamond.  Is it really?  Yeah.  Who saw that coming?  It's Debbie Diamond placed an ad on Craigslist looking for a kidney for her ailing big brother, 
[02:22:00]  Neil Diamond.  Wow.  Well, let me ask you something about Craigslist.  My kidney's like a rock.  Yeah.  I can't urinate.  Damn.  So, is Craigslist mostly sex stuff or is it everything?  Yeah.  It's actually a really cool site.  You go to every city has it.  They have like apartments, everything you could possibly use.  Erotic stuff is one part of it, but that's maybe 10% of it. 
[02:22:30]  Blood.  I've been pissing out blood.  Blood.  Oh, poor guy.  Neil Diamond, type A blood, needs a match, went to Craigslist.  Yeah, I thought, I just knew Craigslist from Jim.  I just know it as a place you go to get whores, but this is everything, huh?  Someone could maybe help me out.  They made it illegal to sell your kidneys or something because there were people in poor 
[02:23:00]  countries that, God, they did a story.  What the hell was it on, 2020 or something where like a college girl or something gave  up one of her kidneys and the family ended up taking care of it for the rest of her life  or paid for her schooling or something and they were able to do it, you know, because  supposedly it's illegal, like really illegal because people are willing to give up one  of their kidneys because you could live off one to make a lot of money.  How much for a kidney?  I don't know.  Maybe someone could help me out if they saw this special, but then this one family, 
[02:23:30]  they found a loophole and they found this woman that wanted to be a donor willingly.  She wasn't mentally unstable or nothing, but she was, you know, in financial problems and  she wanted to go to school or something like that.  And this family ended up paying for everything, for all her living expenses and, you know,  and allowed her to go to school.  But just didn't give her money.  Yeah, yeah.  They were able to do it in a way where it wasn't illegal.  But supposedly this is really, really popular, that people are more than willing to give  up one kidney for financial, you know, happiness or whatever. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, you got two.  Why not?  Right.  If you're broke, that's a go-getter.  Yeah.  Jimmy's lying.  He's never quitting.  Dave in Indianapolis.  Hey.  Hey.  You really brought the show down with your confession.  I didn't.  We just chatting.  With your confession.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, check this out.  There's no way that Jimmy's going to stop with his horse because I'm 21 right now and  I'm spending at least 200 months on strippers.  All right.  Why are you spending money on strippers?  Strippers? 
[02:24:30]  As a fellow fat-breasted meaty nothing, let me tell you.  But you're not getting anything for the strippers.  Sesame Street is hotter than strippers are.  They do nothing.  Those lame hair over the crotch moves, the stupid ass on your knee.  I beat it, bitch.  Yeah.  What are you getting for your $200?  I'm getting about three minutes of her rubbing on my cock.  It stinks.  Why are you doing it?  Is that some kind of thing that gets you off when you go home?  He doesn't want to make the commitment.  I'm just a shy character.  He doesn't want to make the commitment.  Why don't you spend that money on a hooker? 
[02:25:00]  Absolutely.  You know what?  I really need to.  You know what?  They don't have hookers out here.  Yes, they have to do it.  Well, you find a girl who's done so many drugs that some of her teeth are falling out.  That's the type of girl who will take money to do anything.  I don't want the hiv, Jim.  No, you don't have to get the hiv.  I don't want it either.  But if you get it, at least you don't laugh about it with your friends.  Yeah, tell me you don't have it already.  Completely disease-free, bro.  So what is it, $200 a week?  No, no, no, a month.  Oh, a month.  Yeah, I'm not making cash.  So you save up your money, and then you go to the strip club so she can rub up against 
[02:25:30]  your groin for a few minutes for one song?  There's nothing better than that.  And my whole point here is that, Jim, you're not going to stop me in.  I don't think that's a very pick-me-up attitude.  There is no way, Jim.  You're going to be on here next week.  You're going to say, yeah, you banked him.  You've got to confess when it happens.  I always thought it was true.  300-pound whore that you got from Craigslist.  I know you're going to be back, Jim.  I don't even think you'll make the week.  I'll make the week.  I hate to, you know, and I'm not even trying to do a radio game.  I don't think you'll make Friday. 
[02:26:00]  You know, I'll put a dollar on saying he'll do it before he goes to sleep today.  All right.  What is this, trading places with your awful dollar bet?  You know, it's your job as the listener to help us out with some of these things.  So, you know, let a few days go by and then remind us, and we'll get an update on this.  If you remember, Jimmy quit smoking in one day.  He just stopped.  He dropped it, and that was it.  I'll tell you what made me stop.  We all know the show that made me stop.  Oh, yeah.  What really convinced me was Anthony.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  They don't know because a lot of new listeners out there.  We did a show called What the Hell is That?  What the Hell is That?  And we invited, like, we got to do this again, by the way. 
[02:26:30]  We invited two or three doctors in, and then people that had these weird things, they don't  know what it was.  They would come in, and they would get diagnosed live on our show.  One guy had a rotting cornea that was diagnosed on our show and was basically told he was going  to be blind.  Nice.  I'm trying to remember a lot of the other ones.  I mean, they were just horrific.  Remember the one guy that would sweat profusely only on one half of his face?  One half of his face, yeah.  Yeah, that was weird.  And it only, it happened when he ate, what, hot spicy foods or something like that, but  he only sweated on one half. 
[02:27:00]  And they basically said that's really, really, really bad.  I forgot what they diagnosed him as having, some kind of cancer or some kind of something.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't remember.  But then we got him some chicken wings, and sure enough, one half of his face was just  completely drenched in sweat, and the other side was completely dry.  Maybe he's half Asian.  So then this guy was listening to the radio show, and he decided to just walk in from  the street.  We didn't even know the guy.  He goes, you know, I got something.  I want the doctors to take a look at it. 
[02:27:30]  And what was it?  Was it on his tongue?  It was on his gum.  His gum, right?  Inside of his gum?  Yeah.  A white bump.  A white bump on his gum.  Yeah.  So the, you know, believe it or not, the show is done kind of lightheartedly, and we're  all kind of laughing in general, you know, because in general, most of these guys had  curable stuff, I guess.  Did we have three doctors in?  Yeah, three doctors.  So they're like, oh, let's take a look.  And they open up his mouth, and they got the flashlight, and they look in.  The looks on the doctor's faces, and we're trying to do a radio show, they all looked 
[02:28:00]  at what was going on in this guy's mouth, then looked at it and I like, oh, my  God.  Oh, boy.  This is why we didn't want to do this.  We were hoping we wouldn't see this.  They were horrified.  One guy's like, I'm out.  I don't even want to talk about it anymore.  Yeah, the doctors are conferring with each other.  And then the one doctor is in the corner just whispering, the big C, the big C.  And then now the guy, he's feeling that something's not right, and he starts freaking out, and  he goes, oh, God, just tell me what it is.  Remember?  And he goes, his panic, his fighting to hold on to control and going, all right, where 
[02:28:30]  should I go?  How do I take care of this?  Who should I see?  Who can I see now?  Just asking the questions.  Right.  Thinking he had mouth cancer.  And I watched this, and I'm like, that is what it looks like when you find out you have  mouth cancer.  That's the reaction you have.  Yeah.  And I said, I got to stop.  Enough.  I'm not going to smoke again.  Yeah.  And I'm like, I'm done.  So we took a break.  I remember you smoked one last cigarette. 
[02:29:00]  I said, I'm going to have one more parliament.  And I was like, I'll finish this pack.  And Anthony goes, I want you to just fucking quit.  I'm like, all right, point taken.  Did he really say that?  Oh, yeah, he did, with complete disgust.  If I said, hey, Ann, I want to pull your zipper down.  I want to toot on that for a minute.  His reaction couldn't have been more revolted.  But he said, he just was like, just fucking quit.  I forgot that.  You used to be a heavy smoker.  Oh, my God.  When we first met you, I forgot all about that.  We couldn't even do a radio show.  One of his only vices.  You were always just smoking in between breaks. 
[02:29:30]  And remember how bad a Nick Fitz you had when you were in jail with Lewis on the voyeur bus?  Yeah.  All the guys said Jim was going crazy.  I was, yeah, I was on my mind.  I had one more cigarette that day, and I went down to the Comedy Cellar, Estee got me the pouch, whatever.  And that was it.  It was the last cigarette I smoked.  That's a wild note.  I still have urges occasionally.  If anyone who's quit smoking knows, I mean, you know.  Yeah, you get the urge.  That's close to three years ago now.  December will be three years.  Right?  And he was able to do that.  So I, but the whores, that's a different thing.  Booze and drugs.  Booze and drugs.  You know what it is?  But this is more mental health than physical health that you were, that, not you're worried 
[02:30:00]  about, but that, you know, it's kind of, the physical health thing, you could quit something  and go, all right, I'm quitting it because I want to be physically healthy.  Right, right, right, right.  The mental health thing is like, I could deal with it.  Yeah.  You're right.  Screw it.  Call up, get another whore.  All right.  We got some info, I think, on the kidney thing.  A couple calls here.  Ron in Jersey.  What's up, Ron?  Yo, ONA, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yo, that was either on 2020 on 60 Minutes. 
[02:30:30]  What I saw was people in India were giving their organs up to repay their family debt.  Okay.  Well, the story I saw is definitely in America where they got this college-age girl to donate  a kidney to save, I think, the husband or something.  This goes back a while, but they're doing it in India.  Yeah.  Same thing.  I mean, like, I don't know if anybody, I don't know if Norton or anybody out there  smoked, like, these crazy Indian cigarettes, like, they said it tastes like all kinds of  fruit flavors and stuff like that.  They showed this tour, like, you may, a family may loan you, say, $2,000 in these people, 
[02:31:00]  and then their families and their kids had to, like, roll these cigarettes, like, all day.  And, like, when they figured out the transactions, like, these people would never repay their debts.  They'd be just rolling friggin' cigarettes all day.  So, and it's a fucked-up country, man.  All right.  Well, thank you, Ron.  Let's say hi to David in Jersey.  He might have some more info on the kidney thing.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning, sweetie.  I feel so bad about Craigslist.  Oh, no, it's all right.  I'll be fine. 
[02:31:30]  Thank you, though.  I tried it, too.  It sucks shit.  About the kidneys, I think the going rate was $20,000, and the second problem was that  in the third world countries, there were kidnapped people, chopping them up and selling their  body parts in the black market.  The black market.  The famous black market.  Where is the black market?  The black market.  Yeah.  I love that one.  I think it's cold.  Stop.  I love that one.  The black market.  That's a true story, man.  Yeah.  This guy got a hooker and had sex with her and stuff and then passed out. 
[02:32:00]  He woke up the next morning.  He was in a bathtub full of ice.  I know this because this was like a friend of my brother-in-law.  Mm-hmm.  He woke up in a bathtub full of ice and there was blood in there and stuff and he had a note  that said, get to the hospital immediately.  So, he kind of dragged himself out of the tub and he didn't feel good and he was bleeding.  He went to the hospital and when he got there, the doctor told him, oh my God, your kidney's 
[02:32:30]  been cut out.  And, you know, apparently there was a gang going around and they were doing this and he  taking people's kidney and selling them on the black market.  Don't laugh at it.  It's true.  It just reminds me of what happened to a friend of mine.  Oh.  A friend of mine who had a friend, actually.  Yeah.  A friend of a friend?  Yeah.  He was, he liked scuba diving.  Uh-huh.  And he was just minding his own business, checking out the tropical fish and stuff, right?  And I guess there was a fire, you know, on land somewhere and, you know, those big sea 
[02:33:00]  planes that-  Oh, that drop the water?  That's scuba-  No, you know who this is?  Oh, yeah.  Because I know the guy, too.  Yeah, no, I know this guy.  So, you know, they're-  Wow.  They're putting out the fire with the water as they're scooping it out.  Oh, I know the story.  I know the guy.  Fly over the fire and they drop the water and it usually does the job and, you know,  puts out some of these forest fires and then, you know, they checked out the area where  the fire was and they find this guy in complete scuba gear.  Scouba gear and not burnt. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, that was the thing.  Oh, yeah, I know.  You do know the guy.  I know the guy.  And I guess what happened was when the planes were scooping out the water, they actually  scooped-  Scooped them right up and dropped them.  And dropped them on the fire with the water.  Yeah.  So, I believe this stuff.  Oh, sure.  Sure.  It's got to be true.  Yeah.  Sure, gloves.  Ah.  My kidney turned blue.  Now you know I need one.  Huh?  Yeah.  Anything? 
[02:34:00]  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hello, sweetheart.  Hi, fella.  I have two things to say now.  But the first thing was you broke up that show where you had the doctors in.  Yeah.  I quit.  I quit the exact same day.  And the way I figure it now is that I'm paying two bucks a month.  But I still owe you a boatload of money because I'm saving like six bucks a day on smokes.  You're right.  That's right.  So I don't mind the extra two bucks.  So I'm getting some people to sign up.  Well, man, cigarettes are up to what?  Like seven, eight bucks now?  Well, yeah, in the city.  But yeah, you get them about six bucks, you know? 
[02:34:30]  That's crazy.  But the other thing, a friend of mine, you know, this was a weird thing.  And this pertains to Jimmy, too.  Paid for a hooker, you know, had a good night, passed out.  Woke up the next morning and on the mirror was written in lipstick, welcome to the world of AIDS.  Yeah.  That was a good friend of mine.  Yeah, that happened to it, too.  I remember reading about that in the paper.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a friend of my brother-in-law's sister's cousin's roommate.  I think I read that in The Plains Dealer, actually.  Oh.  Yeah, I think it was out of Cleveland, Anthony.  Very good.  Very nice. 
[02:35:00]  I had a, I had, it's funny, I had a, I know a friend of mine who got a hooker, and when  he fell asleep, the kid, the lady's son came in and wrote red rum on the mirror.  And had a little boy who lived in his mouth.  Charlie!  Yeah, I kind of remember that.  Hey, what's up, Charlie?  No, listen, I get, I know how you get Jimmy to quit using hookers.  No.  All right, like you do with the doctors, all you got to do is have a guy come in with  lumps on his dick and shit.  Look, he gives himself a little laugh. 
[02:35:30]  Lumps on his dick and shit.  I don't want to see some guy's lumpy mule, sir.  That's all I need to do now is switch addictions.  Yeah.  All right.  One more.  One more.  We got to take a break.  Tim in Staten Island.  What's up, Tim?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  This one with you know, when I was younger, I had a little friend.  He wanted me on the porch.  He told me, welcome to the world of Monster Aid.  I'm punching out later.  All right, Jesus.  Welcome to the world of Monster Aid.  All right.  Remember that one?  Welcome to the world of A's.  Yeah.  All right.  Why don't we, you know, we got to play this one, too. 
[02:36:00]  A listener sent this in.  That's something else we used to have on the old show, and it has a little Christmas theme  to it.  The old show.  We're not going to start playing a lot of these, but I don't know.  Why not?  They're great.  Yeah.  We got to spread them out, though.  They get boring after a while.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remember Ding, Fries Are Done?  Oh, yeah.  I remember this one.  Kind of a retard singing a little holiday favorite.  How could you lose when retards are involved?  Singing about fries.  What?  This depressed me so much. 
[02:36:30]  When I found this, someone emailed me this, like, there's a site where you could click  on and hear this, and it would bum me out so much because it reminded me of the show  I couldn't even listen to it.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We used to play this a lot as well.  That's true.  Everything, like, that reminded me of the show when we were off, couldn't even listen  to it.  Nope.  Like, it pissed me off.  Commercial radio I stayed away from, believe it or not, except for the fans.  It's sports.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was so depressing.  Ew.  Well, my brother, he got me XM Saturday Radio two years ago.  Yeah, as soon as we got canceled, fire, whatever, a couple months went by, he knows how much 
[02:37:00]  I'm into radio in general, and he knew I was not going to listen to commercial radio  whatsoever.  He got me the satellite radio.  Been checking this out for a long time, though.  I would just listen to the news station.  Really?  Wins.  Yeah.  And hear the same five stories over and over and over and over and over and over.  Come on, John Montone.  Spices those stories up, though.  And over and over.  We're here in Brooklyn for the world's biggest loaf of bread.  I'm John Montone.  Oh.  Here in Staten Island. 
[02:37:30]  They give him those stories, those, what are they called?  Human interests?  Human interests.  You'd think one day something would happen exciting in front of him that he'd have to  go, a plane has just crashed.  I'm John Montone.  That's probably what he dreams about.  That's something that's going to happen when he's out in these dumb stories and he'll actually  be a newsman.  Instead, he's talking about this year's couple that had to get married during the New York  City Marathon.  Yeah.  Way to be original.  It's one of those guys.  You know what I heard the other day?  They were doing that. 
[02:38:00]  What's the charity they do?  Oh.  Hungry.  Hungry-thon.  Hungry-thon.  World Hungry-thon.  World Hungry-thon.  How could you forget about Hungry-thon?  I blocked it out of my head.  We were part of the Hungry-thon marathon.  Yeah.  For one year.  Until the priest saw the double dildo whore show.  Yeah.  That was one of the best moments ever.  We were supposed to be taking bids on rock items like a signed Clapton guitar and stuff.  Crazy stuff.  Yeah.  And we had two dykes doing each other with double-dong dildo. 
[02:38:30]  And we invited the guy that was heading the Hungry-thon charity.  Well, because he kept running in to give us the latest bid.  Yeah.  And our show is the most popular at N.E.W. by far.  And we were making the most money as far as N.E.W. goes for this charity.  I thought he was just the guy that was coming in saying, hey, guys, the Clapton guitar is up to 1,400 bucks.  Keep it going.  You want to push it again?  So we figured out.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll share it with the guy.  He seems cool.  We'll share it with the guy.  Hey, man.  Check this out.  It's like, who doesn't want to see a double dildo? 
[02:39:00]  Uh, dingo.  Holy crap.  Double dildo sex show.  Sex show.  Right?  The guy's working hard on this charity.  He could use a little break.  So we're like, hey, check this out.  Two girls, one double-dong dildo.  What do you think?  Like storms out of the place.  Right.  And then we found out, what, the next day or something?  Yeah, our GM tells us, uh, by the way, the guy that was in there, he's a priest.  Yeah, when he's not doing this, he's a priest.  He just wasn't wearing his, uh, doodads.  Yeah.  Wow.  That the priest wears.  And then we weren't Loatian boys enjoying that.  And then we weren't.  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Then, uh, he refused to work with us ever again.  It changed the whole thing around.  Yeah.  How they did it.  Even though we were, you know, raising the most money.  Well, you're going to defend that?  Well, yeah, sometimes.  Are you actually trying to defend that one?  Why not?  You got to suck it up sometimes.  I think he should have been wearing his collar.  You know how many people, you know how many people we helped?  So, you, you, you, you, a little blind eye action.  Yeah, you think he should have been wearing his collar.  He should have moved on.  We would have known.  He should have moved on and said, all right, that really sucks, but these guys are making  me a lot of money for my charity.  Father, look at, look at the dildo show, Father. 
[02:40:00]  Hey, Father.  Father, look at the dildo.  She loves the taste of communion wafers.  Because he couldn't get past the double dildo sex show, people probably ended up starving.  Yeah.  Since then.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And more Hunger Thon trivia, that's the first time Stalker Patty was on the show.  I know.  I know.  Was she volunteering?  Yeah, she was volunteering.  She was cooking in the kitchen.  Remember?  She would follow Opie all around.  She was a volunteer.  She baked me cookies.  I baked you cookies.  Anyway, the Hunger Thon charity that was going on, one of the prizes they were auctioning 
[02:40:30]  off this year, was you would get to follow John Montone around town for one day and record  on those stories with John Montone.  I'm John Montone for 1010 Winds.  At the Battery Tunnel.  I'm John Montone.  Here on the West Side Highway, there's trapeze going on.  Oh.  I'm John Montone. 
[02:41:00]  I'll be off the air.  How much more of these fucking stupid ass stories do I have to do?  And this fucking winner won't leave me alone.  I'm John Montone.  Poor bastard.  Chris in New York, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  It's the first time I ever got out of here with you.  I'm really a little nervous, but I've been listening to you guys for a long time.  I'm glad for that.  Calm down.  Calm down, sir.  Yeah, calm down.  Get a hold of yourself.  It's all going to work out.  I'm driving. 
[02:41:30]  I don't want to hold myself too tight, did you?  All right.  All right.  What's up, Chris?  You remember a few years back, there was a story in the paper about a guy that fell  out of an airplane behind Long Beach Hospital?  Not really.  Not remembering it, really, but something rings a bell about that.  All right.  Go ahead.  Well, I was the morgue man operator that night, and I had to go pick him up.  Oh, you had to pick up the guy?  I had to go scrape him off.  How bad was it?  You know how, like, an apple looks like when it falls off a tree and it just kind  of, like, slaps on the sidewalk? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Eh, kind of like that.  How did he fall out of the plane?  What happened?  Apparently, what happened was that he was, it was a transcontinental flight.  The guy was probably trying to stow away in the landing gear.  Yeah.  And, you know, they don't pressurize that area, and they don't heat it.  It gets a little cold eight miles up.  So he probably died.  And on final approach, they opened up the landing gear, and ba-boom.  He comes falling out.  Oh, I don't know.  It was a commercial airliner.  Yeah.  It was a commercial airliner.  Okay.  This happens a lot.  Not a lot, but it happens every so often. 
[02:42:30]  A couple times a year.  It's not an urban legend.  Another 10 feet, he would have fallen in the canal with New York City's problems.  That's how people get into the country illegally.  They climb up into the, what, the weird...  Most of them die, though.  You can't live at 30,000 feet.  The cold, the lack of air up there, forget about it.  But a guy actually lived from Australia to the United States in the wheel well.  For 20 hours?  20 hours in there.  They say that his body just kind of shut down, but it was so cold that he was revived and 
[02:43:00]  lived through it.  It'd be funny if they sent him right back.  Oh, yeah.  The same way.  In the wheel well.  Yeah.  The same way.  Back in there.  Tie him to the wing.  All right.  We obviously got to regroup.  So here's Ding Fries Are Done, Anthony.  Right?

[02:47:00]  It's Monday, November 29, 2004.  I'm Maggie Linton with the Big Ten today.  Big Ten!  Facing their toughest competition of the young season, fifth-ranked Illinois showed it's a force to be reckoned with, easily handling 24th-ranked Gonzaga 89-72.  Deron Williams and Luther Head were hot with 20 each while leading the Illini to victory in the John Wooden tradition.  Superior three-point shooting and suffocating defense gave Illinois its fourth win of the year and set them up for a real showdown expected Wednesday against top-ranked Wake Forest Demon Deacons in Champaign. 
[02:47:30]  Spartans still need three points to get to 100.  Mitchell brings it down.  He dribbles around, squares for a trade.  This is it!  This is it!  100 for the first straight game!  That's right.  For only the second time in Michigan State history, the Spartans scored 100 in three straight games.  This time, the victim was Nichols State as the 10th-ranked Spartans rolled to a 102-52 win.  The 50-point margin also gave Coach Tom Izzo his 300th victory. 
[02:48:00]  The real test comes when the Spartans tangle with 9th-ranked Duke tomorrow night in the ACC Big Ten Challenge.  That game can be heard starting with the pregame at 8 p.m. Eastern, game time 8 Central, 9 Eastern, on ACC Channel 181.  The news wasn't as good for 20th-ranked Wisconsin.  The Badgers were upset by Pepperdine's 75-61.  The score was tied 34-all at the break,  but the waves washed the Badgers away in the top of the second half with a 25-4 run, 
[02:48:30]  holding them scoreless for more than six minutes,  on two for 13 shooting,  and forcing nine turnovers.  Alondo Tucker and Cameron Taylor were the only Badgers in double figures.  And that's the Big Ten today on XM Satellite Radio.  Big Ten! Big Ten!  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face. 
[02:49:00]  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah.  You're checking out the ONA virus. 
[02:49:30]  Spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  What has my life become when I'm so excited that it's smoothie time for the day?  I know.  I'm like, ooh, it's smoothie time.  In the middle of a break, and all of a sudden, Anthony's like,  it's smoothie time!  Oh, I'm so excited about it.  I didn't give him money.  You've got to come back in here and get money.  Get that good-looking boy back in here.  No way. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  Get back in here.  Take two of every denomination.  There we go.  All paid for.  All set.  I don't know what this guy is trying to say here.  Jason from Michigan.  What's up, Jason?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to give little Jimmy a little window of hope, man.  You know what?  Somebody's out there just as twisted as he is that just is waiting to shit on her, 
[02:50:30]  the guy that she loves.  Thank you, sir.  You're welcome, little Jimmy.  No need to get all mushy.  Well, you know, I just, I can't let you bring yourself down that much, man.  Keep doing with the whores, you know.  Whatever makes you happy, but...  Well, it's not making them happy, though.  I meant her log, sir.  I don't want them to be mushy.  I'd like them to be solid and lesson-teaching.  All right, Jason.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, there's something in the New York Post, a column they call Just Asking. 
[02:51:00]  Just Asking.  And they got some crazy rumors about, you know, very famous people.  They're not even rumors.  I guess they have a lot of good sources.  They have really good sources, but they're not brave enough to say such-and-such likes,  you know, logs dumped on their chest.  They don't put the names in.  And they kind of, it's kind of like a guessing game.  You try to figure out what star they're talking about.  It's always about these celebrities.  And there's three in today's paper, and I think we got the first one,  and we're trying to figure out the next two.  Maybe people can help us out with this. 
[02:51:30]  Look at us.  Look at us with the little radio game.  You get nothing, by the way.  Unlike other shows, you get nothing.  You get nothing.  All those other radio shows give you crap.  If you get the answer right, you get to come in and clean out Ben's sheath with your pinky.  We do have my fives to give away.  We're just trying to figure out a cool way to do it.  I think it starts this week.  We'll have one a week.  Trying to think of a cool way to do it, and this ain't it.  Boy, one MiFi a week.  Thank you so much.  Wow.  I know it's a great, great thing, but come on. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  We should be giving one a day.  The MiFi is a very hot item this holiday season.  They're very new.  They're very new, so maybe they don't have that many to give away.  Remember the old place, the prizes we used to give away, and then they'd be stolen?  Remember that?  We'd have seven MiFis this week, and then all of a sudden Roger would come in.  Guys, you only got two left this week.  Remember that one?  We had satellite dishes and satellite service, and we had like ten of them, and then all of 
[02:52:30]  a sudden we had three.  We had three.  Where did they go?  And seven walked out the door with people.  That's where the prizes used to go.  The prize closet was just raped on a daily basis.  It was unbelievable.  All right, so I guess they call this the blind box or something like that?  They call it Just Asking.  Just Asking.  Just Asking.  In the New York Post.  We'll have to commit.  The New York Post today is just asking, Anthony, which aging action hero is snorting more lines  than he's spouting on screen? 
[02:53:00]  The horny Hollywood He-Man must need the disco dust to stay up and chase the much younger  beauties he likes to collect at nightclubs in L.A. and New York.  Ooh, now I'll guess Stallone.  You're going to guess Stallone?  Wrong.  Okay.  Ben knows this one.  How do you get out of it?  I think it's Bruce Willis.  I just think it is.  Because he's always out in New York.  He's always out late.  He's always out with chicks.  I was going to guess.  I was going to guess.  New York, L.A.  So we're all guessing.  He's just guessing.  I'm guessing.  That's my guess.  Ben doesn't know for sure.  I don't know for sure.  And I don't.  Why do you say Bruce Willis? 
[02:53:30]  I just think it's a good guess.  Because he's out a lot in New York and L.A.  And he's always chasing young chicks.  New York, L.A., young chicks, cocaine.  Cocaine.  Aging action hero.  Yeah, so it can't be The Rock.  Couldn't it be?  It could be a Stallone.  It could be a Bruce Willis.  Ben Gazzara?  No, I'm thinking.  Steven Seagal?  Steven Seagal or Van Damme.  Right.  Could be Van Damme.  No.  When was the last time you heard Van Damme? 
[02:54:00]  After, like, I mean, Chuck Zito knocked him out, right?  I think, yeah, I think Ben's on to it.  Because, you know, the papers definitely talk about Bruce Willis, you know,  being spotted with this young one and this young one over here.  If you read sightings, the sighting section, Bruce Willis is in town.  He's either at Marquee or he's at Hero or he's at, you know,  and then L.A. he's at the Spider Club or so.  All those places Ben goes to also.  So, all right, it's Bruce Willis.  Maybe it's Ben Sparks.  Maybe it's Steve C.  Maybe it's young Ben Sparks. 
[02:54:30]  This audio guy was found with fire on his hat and a fucking fifth of whiskey.  Started into his anus.  We could sneak it into a Styx concert.  Oh, a Styx concert?  I couldn't think of a lamer concert.  I know, man.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Babe, I'm leaving.  It must be on my way.  All right.  The next one is which sexy scribe?  Sexy scribe?  So, it's a hot writer. 
[02:55:00]  It's rumored to be on the rocks with her relatively new hubby.  So, it's a hot female writer.  She already misses her single days and would love to take a quick dip in the dating pool.  Shelley Long.  Long.  Misses her single days.  So, she's married now.  Married.  Female.  Sexy author.  Yeah.  And she's cheating?  Mm-hmm.  Well, no, she's already bored and she wants to go back to being single.  Oh, oh, wants to dump the puppy.  I don't even know any sexy freaking writers.  I don't know any sexy scribes. 
[02:55:30]  That's the problem.  Could it be a writer for a newspaper?  That could be.  That could be also.  Any sexy writers for the...  Daily News or...  So, maybe that's too broad of a...  Maybe we'll leave that alone.  Liz Smith?  Yeah.  Cindy Adams?  Cindy Adams?  A decrepit scribe, maybe.  Speaking of Cindy Adams, she did a sex column.  Oh, stop it.  Because I guess...  What could she possibly even know about this subject with...  Is Joey Adams, her husband, still alive?  No, no, he died a few years ago.  Do you remember the hell of a lie? 
[02:56:00]  Do you remember when he fell down at that press conference?  Oh, yeah.  Do you guys remember that?  Oh, yeah.  And Cindy was just like, oh, well.  Oops.  Hold on.  Let's go backwards a little bit here.  Eric in Staten Island.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  He's got an aging super action hero guy.  He's definitely Van Damme because I watched his Eat True Hollywood story, and he had a  bad coke addiction that destroyed his marriage and all his friends and his whole life.  Hmm.  All right.  You're going with Van Damme.  Yeah.  Van Damme's my pick.  We used to get the answers to these, by the way. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  But the guy that works at the Post used to help us out is not there anymore.  It seems to me, though, Bruce Willis is a little too successful and old successful to  be somebody that's doing coke.  If you're doing coke still at that age, I think you've pretty much, like, blown your  life.  Yeah.  And, you know, I could see why it could be Van Damme.  That could be the reason you don't see Van Damme doing anything anymore.  And I just can't see a guy like Bruce Willis doing blow. 
[02:57:00]  Leftozito knocked him out, too.  That took a lot of his, like, mystique away after he got, you know, just beaten up.  Yeah.  With that big fist.  Oh.  Just bashing you right in the head.  You guys want to hear what funny is?  Okay.  We'll go back to this in a second, because you mentioned Cindy Adams.  So she wrote a column in the Post.  I think this was last week, just before we took a break.  We didn't get to this.  Sex, sex, and lots more sex is the headline.  Ooh.  The Kinsey Report stats.  Men have 1,600 hours of sex in their lifetime. 
[02:57:30]  And then she writes six...  Wait, that doesn't even make sense.  Because it's Cindy Adams.  Wait, men have 1,600 hours of sex in their lifetime.  1,610 if you count with their partners.  Oh, okay.  Oh, she's saying that they masturbate a lot?  No, they cheat 10 times in their life.  Or it could be jacket.  I think it's a jacket.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Ha, ha, ha.  Did she write, only in New York, kids, at the end of it, like she always does? 
[02:58:00]  Uh, all right.  The best cure for a headache is sex, she writes.  Yesterday I called my doc and said, I've got a headache.  He told me, take two bimbos and call me in the morning.  Bimbos.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  She's all right.  Oh.  She got these out of, like, her dead husband Joey's, uh...  Joke book?  Joke book.  So this guy who sat still for the report said, you know, they're talking to the people that  did the sex report, okay? 
[02:58:30]  The other night, my wife met me at the front door stark naked.  What a shock.  She was just coming home.  It's Rodney's joke.  Is it really?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Well, she makes it very unfunny.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Somebody enjoyed it.  Yeah.  Uh, it goes on.  A man's sex drive is in his jeans.  We now know why Levi Strauss used rivets to keep the fly closed.  Hello?  Hello?  This thing on?  Hello? 
[02:59:00]  A North Carolina man was arrested for doing it with his goat.  To make matters worse, the goat is now suing him for palimony.  Anyone?  It's sex.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is in a huge New York paper.  Yep.  And she's writing this, like, this is really funny stuff.  You're supposed to laugh at it.  She's awful.  From Hollywood, the laid-back capital of the universe comes a new religion, relaxology.  Only four commandments, but six suggestions.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:59:30]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Marriage is a very expensive way to get your laundry done for free.  What?  Marriage is a very expensive way to get your laundry done for free.  That was it.  I thought there was more to it.  Overheard during the taking of one couple's survey wife.  How come you never take me anyplace?  Husband, I don't go out with married women.  By the way, you know, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener. 
[03:00:00]  How bad is this?  She's funny, though.  I mean, she really, she's not garyous.  She really, she's a sassy gal.  One man decided to rekindle his romance with the wife.  At midnight, he poured champagne, waltzed her into the bedroom, and whispered,  Do what I tell you, and you won't get hurt.  No?  Anyone?  Hello?  Hello?  This thing on?  Hello?  All right. 
[03:00:30]  Question.  You know, they're working off this Kinsey report.  Dr. Kinsey, how do you know when it's time to go to a marriage counselor?  Answer.  When your husband comes home with confetti in his shorts.  Or if he says, hon, I'm going out for a cigarette, and he calls you from Istanbul.  Another question to Dr. Kinsey, Anthony. 
[03:01:00]  She wrote all this.  Dr. Kinsey, how do my wife and I know when we've reached complete sexual compatibility?  Answer.  When you both achieve simultaneous migraines.  How about this?  How do you know when it's time to masturbate?  When the guy you're banging collapses at a press conference?  Here's another one, Anthony.  Dr. Kinsey, a very rich woman wants to make love to me, but she is not attractive.  What should I do? 
[03:01:30]  Answer.  That's a loaded question, but if she's loaded, there's no question.  Dr. Kinsey, how can you tell if your wife is frigid?  Answer.  If a light goes on when she opens her mouth.  Anyone?  No?  Wow.  Wow.  Question for Dr. Kinsey, yes. 
[03:02:00]  It just goes on and on, doesn't it?  A couple more.  Can you get hurt by unhooking a woman's bra yourself?  Answer.  Only if she's built like Pamela Anderson and the scaffolding breaks.  Don't let me out of me.  Oh, answer.  It goes with answer first here.  Answer first.  Bible belt.  Question.  What did Moses use to keep his pants up?  Oh, I get it. 
[03:02:30]  You do?  Yeah, Bible belt.  Oh, it's kind of like the other joke.  Throat cut.  What should have happened to her as soon as she submitted this?  Some questions on the survey had no answers.  Like this one, for instance, Anthony.  Question.  He's gay, she's bi.  If they split, who gets custody of the blow dryer?  This is in her column.  People are supposed to read this and think this is humorous. 
[03:03:00]  And they still pay her a lot of money to do this.  All right, that's about it, I guess.  Wait, wait, I don't want to, don't skimp on the rest of the jokes.  Having some fun here.  Yeah, one more.  Having a few laughs.  All right.  After group sex, who do you respect in the morning?  We haven't yet seen the movie, but are reliably told there are no answers for the above.  What?  What? 
[03:03:30]  I guess the question is, after group sex.  I'm going to misfire.  After group sex, I'm stuttering now because I'm so uncomfortable, even though this was  supposed to be uncomfortable.  After group sex, who do you respect in the morning?  Oh, that's the end of the joke.  Yeah, there's no end.  I know, I went on to something else.  You went on to a joke.  Oh, I don't know where it ends.  Oh, wow.  Two misfires so far, Eric.  Kinsey was smart.  One respondent asked him for job hunting tips.  He replied, if the application asks you to fill in the line, sex, answer male or female. 
[03:04:00]  Do not write in, your place or mine.  Your place or mine.  How old is she?  Is she that out of touch with what is funny?  Your place or mine.  Why don't you come up and see me sometime?  Is she that out of touch?  And her column ends with this little ditty, Anthony.  And in closing, remember, sex is something a young man needs, a middle-aged man wants, 
[03:04:30]  and an old man can't remember why he loved in the first place.  Did it say only in New York kids at the end?  No.  Only in New York kids.  No, not this time.  That's when it's one of those wacky stories from the street.  She's atrocious.  Brian in New York.  What's up, Brian?  Hey, guys.  That sexy author you were talking about that wanted to divorce was J.K. Rowling.  The Harry Potter author.  Is she sexy?  Well, I don't know, but she just got married, and that's it. 
[03:05:00]  That is kind of a loaded question.  Remember that from the survey there?  All right.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Yeah, let's say hi to Denise in Jersey.  Denise, go ahead.  Hey, the author is Candace Bushnell, the Sex and the City woman.  How do you know?  Well, she recently married Mikhail Baryshnikov, and she's just, you know, she's supposed to be Carrie Bradshaw, you know.  That's how I know.  All right.  I think you might be onto it.  So, so far, it's Bruce Willis.  No, Ben's saying no.  Well, she didn't marry Mikhail Baryshnikov. 
[03:05:30]  That was on the TV show.  She married another guy.  Yeah.  All right.  No, I think she really did, though.  Ben thinks the sexy scribe is Bruce Willis also.  He just answers Bruce Willis to everything.  All right.  And finally, which recently married Hollywood heavyweight has an Oedipal issue before?  Hey, wait, wait.  Could it be Harrison Ford?  Someone thought that on the feedback.  What about Harrison Ford?  Could it be Harrison Ford?  Going back to the Bruce Willis one?  Yeah.  With the Coke and the Young Broads?  Nice.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, he kind of likes Young Broads. 
[03:06:00]  He was in the car with a couple of them when they snapped that picture through the windshield.  He should slow down.  Oh, please.  He should be very...  The Young Broads looked like they were in that cave in Indiana Jones when the skeletons came out the way he looked.  Oof.  All right.  And finally, Anthony, which recently married Hollywood heavyweight has an Oedipal issue before he walked down the aisle this summer?  So it's someone in Hollywood that got married this summer.  Heavyweight?  Heavyweight.  Someone really big in Hollywood.  Before he walked down the aisle this summer, he had a secret nook in his bedroom. 
[03:06:30]  And when women would enter, he would channel Elvis, and they would have to call him Daddy.  It means heavyweight as far as their rep or their weight.  Would it be a fat guy?  Which recently married Hollywood heavyweight?  Could either be a fat guy or someone that's really, really big in Hollywood.  Oh, I know.  Who?  I lied.  It's hard to see what that felt like to say.  Ben? 
[03:07:00]  Bruce Willis?  Who?  No.  Well, the Elvis thing is Nicolas Cage, but I don't know.  Right, Nicolas Cage.  That's the obvious one.  Did he get married this summer again?  I don't know.  Yeah, he did, actually.  He married that Asian chick.  That's right.  That's like 20.  That's right, he did.  He married that young Asian chick.  Yeah.  Why would he channel Elvis?  He's a freak.  Because he's like so into Elvis.  Yeah, he loves Elvis.  Oh, he really is?  Yeah.  He married his daughter.  That's right.  He married to her for 10 minutes, and you know that was just because she's Elvis' daughter.  That's the only reason.  Yeah, it's fine.  She, by the way, is a slob. 
[03:07:30]  She got fat.  Yeah.  Just had to bring that up.  I'd still give her a tuchus a good eating, though.  Because she's Elvis' daughter?  Absolutely.  Or because you find her attractive.  Who cares what she looks like?  I'd make her put on one of his old jumpsuits and rip a hole in the back, and I'd give her  a tuchus a good cleaning.  All right, well, there you have it.  All right.  They do that every week there in the New York Post.  Why don't we get another quick break in here?  All righty.  When are our smoothies coming in?  Well, soon, I hope. 
[03:08:00]  The smoothie order kind of slowed down the whole damn radio show.  How did that happen?  I love a good smoothie, though.  We need a better way to get the smoothie order in, and they've got to arrive during commercial  break, because now you guys are just sitting here anxiously waiting for your smoothie.  Oh, we're chomping at the bit.  And I know we're not going to talk about this today, but can I just say...  Oh, I forgot about that.  No, we don't have to talk about it.  I just want to say the guy who's...  Because I showed Ant the book, and he threw it on the floor.  Yeah, that's why we were laughing earlier.  I forgot about that.  I take it that's an ixnay on the discussion A.  The guy who sent in the big book of boy stuff, Bart King, says FBI approved on the front. 
[03:08:30]  Federal Burping Institute.  That's funny.  Oh, I missed that.  Are you kidding?  I threw the book, and I missed that line.  Let me see that.  That is something.  Federal Burping Institute.  It's the big book of boy stuff.  And I guess it's supposed to be a whole book of things that interest guys. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Looks like a textbook.  Textbooks are a little...  The back one's got a funny line on, though.  Oh, what does it say?  It says CIA manual, but then it says CIA is craniums in adversity.  I'm trying to...  I don't get it.  I don't really get it, either.  It smells good, the book, right? 
[03:09:30]  It smells like the first day of school.  I'm going through the book, and I don't really see anything I would want to read to anybody.  That's not good.  I'd rather read more Cindy Adams stuff, I think.  I just smell the book.  Yep.  The writing stinks, but the book smells good.  Doodah.  Indoor games?  What is it about a pocket knife that we like?  They have sharp blades, and they fold up and fit in our pocket.  They're fun to hold and to goof around with. 
[03:10:00]  And, of course, the pocket tools like the Leatherman Pocket Survival Tool are also cool.  Folding pocket knives were made 2,000 years ago for Roman soldiers.  These old knives had folding blades and many attachments, include...  What?  Pooping and peeing, Anthony.  Some people think that you should not poop in the woods because there are plenty of logs there already.  Hello? 
[03:10:30]  Hello?  Nevertheless, when you have to go, you have to go, and nature calls a lot louder when you're out in it.  A good rule of thumb for pooping and peeing is to take care of your business at least 100 feet from camp.  Peeing.  Here are the most important words you will ever read.  Don't pee into the campfire.  The smell will be awful, and everyone will hate you.  Pee where nobody will be disturbed by you, but don't get lost.  Think of how embarrassing that would be if you got lost while going for a pee.  It's as embarrassing as having your name as author of that book. 
[03:11:00]  And then he has a scenario.  Father says, how did you get lost, Timmy?  Timmy says, I was going to take a pee, and the next thing I knew, I was lost.  Father says, why didn't you let me go with you?  Timmy says, because the last time we did that, you raped me by a tree.  Yeah!  Some male campers just keep a wide-mouth jug near their sleeping bag in case they have  to go during the night.  Wide-mouth jug.  Thank goodness you were born a boy.  Just make sure that nobody wants any lemonade in the morning. 
[03:11:30]  I misread it.  Wide-mouth jig.  Jesus.  There's a good line here, by the way, about bullies.  Yeah.  It says, when I was a kid, everyone was always trying to convince me that bullies were actually  cowards.  If you just stood up to the bullies, they would chicken out and leave you alone.  And then he says, what a bunch of baloney.  Baloney.  Pooping.  There we are.  Pooping. 
[03:12:00]  Taking a good dump in the wilderness requires you to hunker down.  This means that since you don't have a toilet to sit on, you're just going to have to pretend.  Now you're hunkering.  After you're done, most good campers do a thing called cat sanitation.  That means they bury their poop like a cat does.  Ah.  Uh-oh.  And to do this, Anthony, you need a small shovel.  Dig a hole at least six to eight inches deep, hunker down, and poop into it.  Toilet paper.  Hunker down.  If you have ever had to wipe using bark or leaves, you'll know it is not very pleasant. 
[03:12:30]  It's even worse if you accidentally grab some poison oak.  Be sure to clean up well.  You don't want to leave any dew on the lily, if you know what I mean.  This could lead to bacon strips in your underwear instead of in the frying pan where they belong.  As for the toilet paper, be friendly to the environment.  Either burn it or bring a zipper lock baggie and pack it out with you.  If you will be camping in the same spot for a while, just sprinkle some dirt over your poop  so that others can use the spot.  When you are done with your poop hole, cover it up completely, and run away. 
[03:13:00]  Wait, Opie, there's a section in here.  Oh, oh, gee, oh my god, he's gonna...  What?  What's the window?  Oh, oh.  Now, Opie, you may have thrown that too soon.  You missed the section marked,  Jokes!  Exclamation point.  Under the caption,  School and Studies.  Father.  From this report card, son, it looks like you studied underwater.  Timmy.  What do you mean, Dad?  Father.  Well, all of your grades are below C level. 
[03:13:30]  And then Timmy says,  Good one, Dad.  Hello.  Hello.  How about this?  To a friend who's short.  Got some things for short people here.  How's the weather down there?  Ooh.  Ooh.  I've heard of half pints, but you must be a quarter pint.  There's another good one for people that are short, by the way.  How is the gig, Voss?  Do you know why you aren't allowed on ships? 
[03:14:00]  Because you have to ride in a shrimp boat.  I don't trust short people.  Their brains are too near their butt.  All right, Anthony.  We found out who brought this to the show.  How many more copies do we have to destroy?  That's it.  You've got all four of them. 
[03:14:30]  Steve, who gave you this?  A guy in Oregon.  Wow.  A guy in Oregon sent us in, huh?  Bart King.  Bart King, yeah.  He's just ripping the whole book.  Just keep ripping as I do it.  One page at a time.  Anthony says,  Dear Steve, here are some copies of the big book of boy stuff.  If you're interested in specific things for the show, here's some I think that would work.  Oh, he wrote down a little list of things that will work. 
[03:15:00]  So he likes his insults chapter, which is page 153 in your workbook, Anthony.  Hold on.  Do you still have page 153?  You bet I do.  Insults!  Exclamation point.  All right.  It starts off by...  153.  153, Ed.  I'm not there yet.  Wait, hold on.  I'm on page 140.  Let's get to 153 quickly.  Oh, that's where I was.  All right.  It says,  Part of being a boy is enjoying a good insult.  I say enjoying because boys know that when done properly, one of the best parts of friendship  can be insulting or dissing your buddies.  It's an excellent day when you can hang out with your buds and get in some good zingers, 
[03:15:30]  which is true.  You little scumbag!  I got your name!  I got your ass!  I got to get up to that page.  Hold on.  That's 51, 153.  You are, right?  Yeah, we are, 153.  All right.  Hey, if you can't laugh at yourself, make fun of your friends.  Just remember...  You are a disgusting fat body, Private Pile!  That's a good example.  Just remember that you should only enjoy insults with friends and relatives who are in a good  mood, like practical jokes.  They are not to be used on strangers or people you do not get along with.  They obviously have not hung out with Club Soda Kenny, Jim Norton, Rich Voss, and the 
[03:16:00]  rest of the crew.  What side was that, Private Pile?  Sir, left side, sir!  Are you sure, Private Pile?  Sir, yes, sir!  So then the guy has...  What?  Then you hit him in the side of the head.  Then the guy has examples of good insults that you can use on your friends.  Wait, wait, what page, Opie?  154.  Oh, here I am.  You want to read the insults?  Let's practice...  This one's really good.  I read the short one.  Okay.  That's what I was reading.  All right.  To friends who are short.  This one's really good.  All right, go ahead.  To a friend you want to call ugly, beginner. 
[03:16:30]  You're ugly, intermediate.  You're so ugly, when you were born, they put tinted windows on your hospital room.  Advanced.  Can I borrow your face for a few days while my butt is on vacation?  Wait, wait, you've got to read the others.  To a chubby friend, beginner.  You are chubby.  Intermediate.  You are a wonderful all-around person.  It just takes a while to walk all around you.  And then the advanced person.  That's really good at insults, Anthony. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah?  You remind me of a map.  A globe, to be exact.  Oh, that's funny.  To a friend who just got a haircut.  Beginner line.  Your haircut stinks.  Intermediate line.  I mean, that's the advanced line.  That's what you...  That's not beginner.  Intermediate line.  Did a lawnmower attack you?  And then the advanced line.  Hey, nice haircut.  Was it half-price day at the barbershop?  Yep.  Wow.  I like in the opposite page, there's special feature ready-made insults. 
[03:17:30]  Okay.  You take one word from column one, and one word from column two, and then one word from  column three, and you call people that.  All right.  Like, I'll try.  You, you silly, rotten vermin.  One word from each column.  Right.  See?  I did that.  Jim, you blubbering, freakish, dolt.  Opie, you crawling, wretched, clawed. 
[03:18:00]  I'll make up my own.  You AIDS-ridden fucking cunt.  I don't see those here.  No, it's on the bottom part of the page.  Maybe you ripped that out.  More insults to a friend you want to call stupid.  The beginner line would be, you are stupid.  Intermediate line, want to see something stupid, look in a mirror.  The advanced line, brains aren't everything.  In your case, they're nothing.  And if you're a genius at insults, I don't think you're stupid, but what is my opinion 
[03:18:30]  worth against the thousands of people who disagree with me?  It sucks.  Well, where's that other card?  I want to see what else he thought was really good in his book.  This guy sure is good.  Yeah.  Making sounds.  The cover's nice, though.  Oh, look at this.  You can turn it inside out.  The cover, it's on the front.  It's a pretty funny, wacky picture.  But when you turn it inside out, it's like a composition notebook.  Like those black and white speckled covers.  Oh, so you could have that and it would look like a regular book. 
[03:19:00]  But your teacher would probably wonder, why are you reading that and laughing?  See, and then if you take the cover off, the cover says physics.  So you just have a physics book.  Your book stinks, mister.  I say we pile them in a big pile and burn them.  Yeah. 
[03:19:30]  Your book stinks.  Yeah, I agree.  Some books should be burned.  How does that think about it?  That's the beginner insult.  Your book stinks.  The intermediate insult is, hey, Steve, if you ever bring this horse shit to the show  again, I'll rip your cock off and stick it in your ear.  All right, did we get rid of all the copies?  What?  The author's on.  Oh.  Hello, Bart.  Hey, guys.  Have you been listening to the show today? 
[03:20:00]  I unfortunately have not.  I didn't know it was coming on until a split second ago.  Bart, I got to tell you something, man.  There's some funny stuff.  Yeah, we got your book.  Okay, super.  Jim, can you give me a copy of the book?  Hold on.  All right.  Here you are, Opie.  No, I'm done.  Yeah, he's all tangled up.  There you go.  All right.  Funny stuff.  Wait, the cover, I don't know where the cover went, Bart.  The cover, well, honestly, I have the, it says physics. 
[03:20:30]  I guess this is what the book has under it if the cover is off.  Yeah, if you look at the dust jacket and flip it, it has like an old style composition.  Bart, I got to tell you, I really think that you came up with a winner here.  Oh, you guys are too kind.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  He can't hear the show.  No, he can't hear it.  He's still there?  He didn't hear the show?  No.  He has no idea.  No, Bart, we're here.  Okay, sorry.  It's like a guy's how-to book, pretty much.  Yeah, kind of passing on the keys of boyhood to the next generation.  Yeah, Bart, I got to tell you, I think you got some comedic licks to you. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, where'd you get some of the jokes and stuff?  You know, for the jokes, I really ransacked my childhood memory, and I was looking for  stuff that my dad had told me when I was a kid that I thought was funny.  Wow.  Yeah, my dad kind of went through it, and he said, you basically plundered all my material.  Did your dad have brain cancer?  Sorry, I'm picking up a weird reverb there.  He'll put it back there.  No, it's working.  Is that your phone?  I guess.  It's cordless. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, yeah.  There's some kind of static.  Yeah, sorry about that.  That's okay.  That's okay.  We can still talk here.  So, what, it's a book?  How would you best describe the book?  I guess I would call it a combination of Mad Magazine and Boy Scout Manual.  That's what I was looking for with it, anyway.  That hits it right on the head, I think.  If you want acid.  So, I kind of have a humorous feature chapter, maybe a chapter on...  Yeah, explain the book a little better, because we just got it, and we went through a little 
[03:22:00]  bit of it, but we haven't really got the gist for our listeners, you know?  Yeah, I don't know.  We talked about the insults, and we thought the insults chapter was absolutely...  Yeah, that was pretty good.  Absolutely brilliant.  Well, I guess if I had one role model that I was looking towards when I read it, it was  the book of Pujol, and if you look on page 130, you'll see his mini-biography.  130.  Wait, wait, 128.  Hopefully this book still has 29.  His nickname was The Fartomaniac. 
[03:22:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah, okay.  The what?  The what?  The what?  The Fartomaniac, Joseph Pujol, right?  Yeah, there you go.  He was kind of a Moulin Rouge performer in Paris, and apparently he was like the highest  stage performer.  Wait, hold on, hold on.  I don't know if I...  Wait, what page is this?  130.  And what was he about again?  Well, apparently when he was a kid, he went swimming, and he sank.  And the reason why was because water was going into his hind end.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:23:00]  He found he had the rare ability to bring air into his rear end, and then once he wanted  to control those muscles, he found that he could do his fart at will.  He could make butt mongos anytime he wanted to.  Who's this, Robert Reed?  Jimmy, you're not as funny as Bart.  Stop trying to out-funny Bart.  He had a stage act where he would make different sounds with his prime quarters, which included  cannons, thunder, all types of dogs, ducks, owls, keys, bugs, etc.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Are you close to the base unit of the phone? 
[03:23:30]  Because I'm hearing a lot of static now.  Oh, sorry.  Actually, I can back off from it a little bit.  Yeah, back off.  Let's try that.  Yeah.  I would have got on the hard line here.  Yeah.  How's that?  That sounds a lot better.  A little bit, but yeah.  What's your favorite section in the book?  It's all fine.  It's been really good.  I don't know what people are thinking, but it's doing pretty well in sales life.  Yeah, it's got to be selling like crazy, man.  It's like hot cakes.  Yeah.  Or like butt bongo cakes. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah, so I think that's kind of a searing indictment of the good cakes to the American public,  but I'll take it.  What's that?  I'll take it.  If people are interested, I think that's fantastic.  Yeah, I think it's obvious you put a lot of work into this thing.  There's a lot of pages.  I like your section on pooping and peeing in the outdoors.  Yeah, I have a sister who's a ranger at a federal park, and she helped me with some valuable 
[03:24:30]  outdoor number one and number two tips.  Yeah, which was, you know, if you're wiping your ass with leaves, you don't want to use the poison oak, obviously.  No, no, people are with any nose clapping, too.  Really?  Because we're city guys.  I had no idea.  Yeah, it's probably clapping.  But poison sumac is a distance second for last choice.  So what to do with the lily with?  All right, we're almost done with the interview here, so, yeah, but anything else you want  to say about the, yeah, what's the most useful chapter, would you say? 
[03:25:00]  Most useful?  Well, you know, guys are always, I'm a middle school teacher, and they start getting interested  in the girls at that age, so I think the girls, bullies, and parties chapter is pretty practical.  What's that one about, quickly, because we're running out of time here.  Well, you know, you start kind of looking at the girls and wondering, well, what's a good  strategy to make myself known to her?  So I pass along some time on her strategies there. 
[03:25:30]  The people are asking for it, what do you say?  Although maybe the insult chapter is actually the most practical one, I don't know.  I guess that's where we started.  There's nothing better than getting a piece in here if they're not your friends.  All right, guys, sorry, I was having a big inclination.  It looks like I might have lost you.  Hello?  Yeah, I'm still here, sorry.  Hey, I'm going to go out and invest in a nice hard line, but thanks so much for having 
[03:26:00]  me on this one, I really appreciate it.  Hello?  Yeah, I'm still here.  What's wrong with the phone?  He's not here anymore.  I can hear you.  Weird.  Hello?  Yeah.  Ben, there's something wrong with the line 10.  Hello?  I can hear you guys.  Uh-huh?  Yeah.  I think he hung up.  Bart? 
[03:26:30]  Bart?  Bart?  Yeah.  Bart?  Yeah, I'm here.  Bart?  Are you hearing me?  I can hear something.  Bart?  I can kind of hear a tinny voice far away.  I can't believe we got the answer to this book on and we lost him.  Bart?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tell you what, I'm going to hang up if anyone can't hear me, and if you want to ring back,  that'd be super.  Why did he hang up, dude?  I don't know why he hung up.  Did he get pissed off?  I didn't hang up. 
[03:27:00]  Did he get pissed off?  I thought the interview was going well.  It was going well.  Are you going to plug the, uh, the book with that?  I'll even give the other, the name of the book is, uh, physics.  Why wouldn't you want to plug physics?  No, no, no.  That, you're, the cover's off that one.  All right.  Well, that was Bart.  Maybe he'll call us back.  Oh, he.  First of all, it stinks in here now, Jimmy.  Sorry.  Those were real farts.  Oh, God.  That wasn't us with our stupid machines. 
[03:27:30]  Those three real guests just ran into the mic.  That was a bad one.  Oh.  He's doing the interview.  As his book, three copies are being ripped to shreds.  How could he not hear that ripping?  I know.  Wait, what page is that?  Hold on.  How do you not hear that?  He thought it was static.  Maybe everybody he talks to about the book, he hears that noise.  Oh, Jesus.  What's with my phone?  That's a loud book. 
[03:28:00]  All right.  Well, there you go.  Okay.  Oh.  What?  Huh?  What?  What is, what is Ben and his Nicholson hair saying?  Yes?  I don't know.  We'll take a break and we'll figure it all out.  My ass is insanely fuckable.  Would you like to pinch my quivering love pie? 
[03:28:30]  My breasts are like 2,000 watt light bulbs.  Would you like to play Tune in Tokyo?  Only Opie and Anthony can satisfy my need for giant, pulsating American man meat.

[03:33:30]  That was fun.  Yes, Jimmy?  I was wondering if you were going to finish that Plaster of Paris breakfast.  I know.  That hardened oatmeal.  That's been there for four hours.  I know.  Coagulated oatmeal.  Look at this thing.  It's like horse sheath filling.  Oh, it does.  It makes a thud.  Listen.  Wait.  Just do that again.  That's the sound right there.  If you could follow that by crying, that's the sound of a miscarriage. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  All right.  Look.  A little.  Why?  The wet thud.  I just want to hear the sound of crying and the Christmas music turned off.  We're trying to be user-friendly here.  We want more listeners.  Here.  Here comes Santa Claus.  You can call somebody.  Hey, Steve.  How was your weekend?  It's good.  How was yours?  My instant feedback's not working.  Is yours?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, it is? 
[03:34:30]  I lost mine.  It's not.  No, it's still up here, but it's not refreshing.  Steve, you go to the movies this weekend?  Yeah.  Yeah, so I...  Ah, I went to the movies.  What'd you see?  The number one movie was that Treasury movie.  What the hell is it called?  National Treasure.  National Treasure with Nicolas Cage.  No.  You must have seen that.  Nope.  Nicolas Cage.  The Incredibles?  I have seen The Incredibles, yes.  Oh, this weekend, right?  The Incredibles was pretty incredible.  It was.  It was fantastic.  No, but I saw that last weekend.  Nope.  I have seen that, but not this weekend. 
[03:35:00]  Is that Alexander the Great movie?  I don't want to see that, but no.  I haven't seen that yet.  Spongebob Squarepants?  No, I haven't seen that yet.  No, sorry.  What'd you see?  Bridget Jones, The Edge of Reason, or something like that.  What?  I'm just wondering if other members of the crisis hotline.  Really?  Not voluntarily. 
[03:35:30]  No, it's one of those things.  When you're in a relationship, when you're married.  No, no, I love your wife, man.  She's really cool, but that's when you have to just put your foot down and basically say,  go with your friends.  I do, and I've been putting it off for her.  I think you're at that point in your relationship where you could tell her, you know, maybe that's  a movie you see with whatever her best friend is, whatever her name might be.  Yeah, you know what?  And that excuse worked for, what, since it's been out three weeks?  She hasn't been able to get anybody to go with, so I got taken to it. 
[03:36:00]  You know?  You friggin' fag, you want to make out or something?  Sorry.  Sorry.  Did you like the movie, Steve?  No, quite honestly, I don't get it.  I don't understand those Bridget Jones movies.  And in all fairness, there are guys, you look around the theater, and there are, you know,  there's obviously guys that are in the same boat that you're in.  Yeah, you know.  You just sort of, you know, SS faggot.  Yeah.  But you're kind of right.  I mean, honestly.  Because when I saw bridges of Madison County, whatever the hell that was, I saw guys in 
[03:36:30]  the same position as I was.  Yeah, you look down the aisle, and you give the obligatory, eh, you too, kind of, you know,  to the other guys in the place.  Yeah, that'll keep you all men.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you too, huh?  Yeah, exactly.  It's just, I didn't, I don't get it, I don't like it, I think Renee Zellweger fat is awful.  So it was a waste of time for you, doesn't she understand that?  Yeah, but you know what?  I took her to see Saw two weeks ago.  You know, she sat through that, so I guess if I'm going to be fair, it was awful.  It was a horror movie.  Why don't you guys, I don't know, go to the theater together and go, hey, I'm going to 
[03:37:00]  go check out this movie, you check out that one, and we'll meet after going together.  I think you ought to get more of a compromise movie.  That never works.  Never works.  Do something more masculine, like go to a movie and hit the button and the little curtain  in between the two booths comes up.  Strange you can't get company for that one.  No, I guess not.  No, it's, I don't understand.  I mean, there's plenty of people that did like it, I'm sure.  I just don't understand, you know, it's so far removed from reality, and I understand  you're supposed to suspend disbelief when you watch these movies, but there's no way I 
[03:37:30]  understand how this fat, homely, stringy-haired Renee Zellweger is supposed to be lovable.  I like her a little chubby, man, I gotta tell you.  A little chubby.  Nah, she's hands down ugly in this one.  And then she gets emaciated after she does these Bridget Jones movies.  Well, yeah, because they pay her, what, $100,000 a pound?  Then she becomes anorexic.  Yeah.  Put the weight on?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Were you right when the opening credits are rolling, were you just like, oh, how long is  this?  Yeah, it's really, you're sitting there.  Some movies where, where, right when it starts, I'm thinking there's no way I'm even going 
[03:38:00]  to like this movie a little bit, enough to where, you know, movies that suck, and then  halfway through you're like, all right, I'm kind of into the story, or some, there's something  in there that you can watch.  There's some movies, and that would be one of them, that Hugh Grant is in that.  Yeah, you know, there's some people that love.  What a bore, what a tremendous bore that guy is.  Every movie he's in is just the dull, make-you-fall-asleep piece of crap. 
[03:38:30]  Romantic comedies.  He stinks.  Snooty, uptight, romantic comedies.  Boring.  Boring, and I, you know, I just, whatever.  I just suck it up.  Romantic comedies are never funny.  Gee, thanks.  Never.  They're awful.  I think there's more violent female promos in your future now.  Yeah.  Oh, see?  Yeah.  I'm actually working on the new show intro, and that's got a few little, little, little  twins, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm holding back, I'm backing off, I'm trying to do it, I'm  trying to have a balance.  You guys do not make it easy, though, I have to admit, you really don't. 
[03:39:00]  Thank you.  Well, no one realized we have Richard Speck doing the promos.  That's a little harsh.  That's me.  All right, bye-bye.  See you soon.  There you go.  All right, bye-bye.  All right, bye-bye.  Okay.  Best friend wants to start an affair.  What's this from?  Ooh.  Um, Harriet Cole.  Some colored lady that's, uh... 
[03:39:30]  Jeez.  Wait a minute.  Colored lady?  Oh, B.  Well, you know, the Abby sisters there, I think they're both dead now, and they're trying  to find new columnists instead of making believe they're still alive writing columns.  I thought the daughter was writing for one of them.  For one of them, and then there's this colored broad.  It's not colored.  What's wrong with colored?  It's a dated term that some people find offensive in this day.  Break down the word.  What does it really mean?  This day.  She has a little color to her face. 
[03:40:00]  Well, that's what they used to say in the 50s.  What?  This is the feedback.  We're all getting really funny.  It's really giddy.  Can I say to this guy, Michael, did people get in trouble after yelling,  fire at Steve's hat in a crowded theater?  You know, freedom of speech does not give you the right for Steve to walk into a theater  with that hat on. 
[03:40:30]  That's hilarious.  Oh, flaming hat watching Bridget Jones' diaries.  Yuck.  That's hilarious.  That's funny.  All right.  So, Harriet Cole's column.  Best friend wants to start an affair, Anthony.  Dear Harriet, I met my best friend who happens to be male on the first day of ninth grade ten  years ago.  Ten years ago, ninth grade.  We were really close during school and managed to maintain contact through college.  Though we went on a few dates, nothing ever came of them, and we opted to keep things 
[03:41:00]  platonic, especially since I was away in college, all right?  I recently found out he got married this summer.  I was hurt that he didn't invite me to the ceremony, and though we have spoken at least  once every two months over the past two years, I never even knew he had a girlfriend, let  alone a fiancé or a wife.  And she's hurt at this, that she wasn't invited to the wedding.  Right.  She's a girl friend of his, and as they're growing up, guys can't tell their fiancé wife 
[03:41:30]  thing that they're inviting this girl friend of his to the wedding.  Girls have no clue that if she's a friend of his, it's up until he gets a fiancé or gets  married.  And then it's not going to be some TV show relationship where he's able to invite her  to the wedding.  The wife hates you.  That guy's wife hates you.  Doesn't know you, hates you.  The guys don't have friends that are women. 
[03:42:00]  Right.  They just don't.  It's the old gag everyone knows.  And we talk about this from time to time, and I don't even want to listen to your story  today.  It's just, it's not happening.  No, it's not.  If you're a heterosexual guy, you don't have friends that are girls.  And if you have friends that are girls, you're probably a gay guy.  Or how many, how come guys don't say she's like my sister, but it's always a hot chick  who they're trying to hook up with.  It's never a 350 pound.  In the back of your mind, always you're hoping to get laid.  Always trying to bang them.  That's not really a friend. 
[03:42:30]  No.  Right.  Who cares about her problems?  You listen.  All right.  So this guy goes off, gets married, doesn't invite her to the wedding.  Of course not.  He was in town last week on business, wedding ring and all, and asked me if I still cared  about him as more than a friend.  Because, you know, that's how this relationship kind of started, but it didn't go anywhere.  Without directly asking me to be his mistress, he told me he was still in love with me and  wanted to see and spend time with me more.  I love this man and have for ages, and I don't think I could shake my feelings for him.  Yeah, he's married, but I'd like to be able to let him go without hurting our friendship 
[03:43:00]  or breaking my own heart.  And then Harriet writes, I'm sorry, but this man doesn't sound like a best friend to me.  He sounds like a man who wants to have his cake and eat it, too.  He loves the fact that he's got you so deep in his pocket, so to speak, that no matter  what he does, including getting married behind your back, you're still going to be there.  He has proven to be disrespectful of your friendship and his marriage.  Is this really the sort of man you want to offer your love?  It's time for you to back off.  He doesn't know how to be your friend right now.  Don't let him draw you into an extramarital affair, because your heart still beats fast for 
[03:43:30]  him.  The guy just wants to get laid.  Yeah.  Disrespects their friendship.  There was no friendship.  It's the guy has always, since ninth grade, since that first day they met in ninth grade,  he's been trying to have sex with her.  She puts it in this friend thing.  So she's the one that ruined it by not having sex with the guy, because that's all he wanted. 
[03:44:00]  So he goes off, lives his life, gets married.  They still carry on conversations, I guess, because he's still like a guy trying to have  sex with her any way, shape or form, even at a distance.  Gets married.  Screw it.  He's not going to invite the girl that he wants to have sex with to his wedding.  You're not a friend to be invited to the wedding.  You're the girl that he wants to have sex with.  And you're not, that girl isn't invited to the wedding.  And then after he gets married, he's still looking to have sex with you. 
[03:44:30]  This girl does, not even just this girl, a lot of girls, they don't get it.  I used to have girlfriends years ago that would say, you know, what, he's a friend, you know.  When I'd be like, what, you're going where with who and what?  What?  Oh, no, he's coming along.  Oh, it's nothing like that.  No, nothing like that.  It's going to be me and this and this and, yeah, he's coming along.  But he's just a friend with the girls and everything.  Yeah. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah, a friend.  Right.  No.  He wants to have sex with any of those girls.  Yep.  No.  And then you're the asshole.  No.  Would you, that's all you think.  Yeah.  And I'm thinking just like he is.  Having sex with the girls.  No.  Girls are so stupid.  You're wrong.  You're stupid like that.  You're stupid.  Understand it.  Any guy that's saying they are friends with you is trying to have sex with you. 
[03:45:30]  Please.  End of story.  I was seeing a girl one time and she was hanging with this guy and she kept saying they were just friends.  So I actually went up to school to surprise her one time and I realized that I walked in and my heart was in my mouth.  Uh-oh.  Because they were just, uh...  Where was his dick and her mouth?  Caught her?  You caught her?  They were just going at it and I'm like...  You actually caught her?  Yeah.  And I'm like, you got what I need.  And she said he's just a friend.  Oh.  You ass. 
[03:46:00]  What an asshole.  Very funny.  You had us both.  I know.  I'm like, wait a minute.  You actually liked the girl?  You had us both.  You did get us bad.  Usually you had smile when we know you're going down that road.  You played that good.  You had some good acting chops to that one.  I kept trying to think of the song and the things that happened.  He just caught them at the school.  Yeah.  I do have good acting chops.  For what?  Did you get called back for that part?  Yes.  My manager was called and good news for the show.  I didn't get it. 
[03:46:30]  They gave it to somebody who's older, obviously, and more gifted.  They want an older porn star, porn store owner?  A guy who works in a porn store.  I'm not even talented enough in this business to play a guy who works in a porn store.  Do you people understand how finished I am in show business?  Oh.  I can't play a guy who sells jerk-off movies.  Yeah.  They want an older guy?  Someone who's just better at it.  That's not the way I read the part.  I saw you.  Me too.  You didn't see my read, though.  Speaking of little Jimmy Norton, we got two more Monster Rain songs in today.  What?  Two more. 
[03:47:00]  They're coming in every day.  Like hotcakes, Hope.  And a lot of them we just throw away.  Sorry, but we do.  Are they running down to the Purple Rain song?  I was thinking that all weekend.  No, we still haven't gone to Purple Rain.  Monster.  There's a lot of Rain songs that people haven't used.  They're kind of going, making their own.  But there's some Rain songs like that Purple Rain.  Have you ever seen the rain?  Who will stop the rain?  Who will stop the Monster Rain?  Singing in the rain?  I think we did Singing in the Rain.  Yeah, somebody did one of those.  Did they?  Well, I don't know what to think of these two that came in. 
[03:47:30]  There's one by DJ New Style and one by Chaz.  Chaz does a holiday Monster Rain song, because now we're heading into the Christmas season here.  Topical.  You want to try the first one?  Is the holiday one?  No, Monster Rain by DJ New Style.  All right.  We'll give it a quick listen.  I like it.  Done on a shoestring.  I tap the balls to it. 
[03:48:00]  Why do you call me up?  Call me up.  Little Jimmy Norton just to get me down.  Get me down.  Down under the porch where you suck me up.  Suck me up.  Jiggle my nuts and wipe them with the sock.  With the sock.  Oh, you silly goose.  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Here it comes, little fella.  You know that this fills us with shame.  So, little Jim.  Little Jim.  Tell your dad it's just a game.  Whoa.  This phase will be over at ten.  You tell me now and again.  Well, we're eight. 
[03:48:30]  Looks like we got two years.  Ba-da-da.  Told you before, I won't play anymore.  Not unless I guzzle fifteen beers.  Gay-gay-gay.  Monster Rain.  A good old time.  Gay-gay-gay.  Two little kids.  Covered in cock slime.  I'll be there.  With the therapist talking about you.  Turn it off.  Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  Turn it off!  Why do you call me up?  Call me up.  Little Jim Norton just to get me down.  In the name.  Under the porch where you suck me up. 
[03:49:00]  Suck me up.  Juggle my balls and wipe them with the sock.  Oh, you silly goose.  Monster Rain.  Monster Rain.  Here it comes, little fella.  You know that this fills us with sh-  All right.  Oh.  What the hell was-  A for effort.  What's with the sock?  I didn't-  He says something about wiping up with a sock.  Wiping your balls with a sock.  Or something.  I don't think-  I don't think that's-  All right, well.  I don't think that's a good one.  That was DJ New Style, and the Christmas one is very short. 
[03:49:30]  Thank God.  All right.  It's from Chaz.  The Holiday Monster Rain song.  I'm a meaty-breasted little nothing.  Well, the clouds are out.  It's no longer dry.  Look under the porch, I'm telling you why.  Monster Rain is coming to town.  He gives his pal a tussle.  Unzips his fly.  Whips out his mule.  Jesus age cries. 
[03:50:00]  Little Jimmy's going to town.  He dreams of kids when sleeping.  Talks to hell and when awake.  He'll show you if he's sputting wood.  What's on his chest?  That ain't cake.  The clouds are out.  It's no longer dry.  Look under the porch, I'm telling you why.  Monster Rain is coming to town.  Oh, okay. 
[03:50:30]  All right.  I like when people that have no singing ability whatsoever want to write a song parody.  All right.  Well, that's what came in today.  Lou Reed did the delivery on that song.  That's what came in today.  And Jimmy said, a dude, a dude.  Where did they get those sound clips of me?  Do you have a computer that you can download?  It's not like you just got them from a car that was passing by.  It didn't sound like good sound clips.  They're off your CD.  That's off your CD.  I know, but it didn't sound like they came directly from the CD on eatabullet.com. 
[03:51:00]  That's not what it sounded like.  Who cares about my stupid CD that you want to order 55 minutes of great comedy?  Are you going to get the Monster Rain shirts done?  Yes.  With the eyes?  Yes.  The eyes under the porch with one eye with the crotch and stuff?  That would be hilarious.  Yes.  All right.  Lisa in Philly.  Hey, Lisa.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  Hi.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hi.  That's where you usually say what you have to say.  You can speak now.  Sorry.  We got the formality out of the way there. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah.  I had an idea for the MiFi giveaway.  If you guys had a contest of the Monster Rain song for a week.  It's not a bad idea, because I think we've really got to end this whole Monster Rain song thing.  Yeah.  People just sent them in.  All right.  Maybe we'll do that, because, yeah, we have a lot of MiFis to give away.  One a week for the next five or six weeks.  So, okay.  So, that's my idea.  Thank you, Lisa.  Back on the air.  Take care.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Let's go to Brad in Michigan.  Hey, Brad.  Hey, man.  What's going on?  What's up?  Hey, I'm so sick of the frickin' Monster Rain songs. 
[03:52:00]  Who's going to come up with Michael Jackson?  Yeah, we're hoping to get, you know, maybe one more good one out of the batch.  Yeah, I think we're fishing, though.  We are fishing at this point.  Sir, I'm too good.  Even in the midst of a Monster Rain discussion, I can't be caught.  All right.  He's out of there.  Of course he is.  Did we discuss everything we have to discuss today?  I think.  I think we did.  I can't find anything because we have pages of that book just all over the place. 
[03:52:30]  Scattered everywhere.  I know there was other material we wanted to get to if we could find it.  Look at all this paper around.  Pages ripped out everywhere.  I guess we could start playing What Did We Learn?  Yeah, it was educational today.  Sure.  Rob on Long Island.  What's up?  Rob?  Do you hit the right buttons, Opie?  He's going to be like, no, my name's Bob.  Oh.  My name's Tom.  Rob?  You.  Hey.  Hello.  We can hear you. 
[03:53:00]  Did he fall asleep?  Well, if he was listening to this show the last 20 minutes, I wouldn't be surprised.  He's on Long Island.  Maybe a frozen turkey hit him in the face during the time he was on hold.  Rob on Long Island.  What did you learn?  Hot toy?  Anything?  What is he doing?  Getting back into his car.  Oh, is that what's going on?  Hello?  Rob?  Hello?  Hey.  Yeah, why aren't you speaking to us?  Yeah, what were you doing?  No, I'm working right now.  I had my phone in the truck.  Damn, I'm sorry, guys.  All right.  What's going on, buddy? 
[03:53:30]  Hey, man.  Well, first, I wanted to ask if Jimmy got the scent of Jager Mikecer off his dick after  Wednesday's show.  That's a little inside joke between me and you guys.  Okay.  I learned that the hot holiday toy this year is going to be the Diddle Me Michael.  Very good.  Thank you, Rob.  Well, who's Rob?  Where was Rob from?  I don't know, but notice we haven't even discussed last Wednesday's show.  So what's the next one that we learned?  Yeah, let's just move on.  I don't want to bring it along.  Let's go to Colorado.  What did you learn today? 
[03:54:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned that there's a law of physics that says shredding pages equals static.  Equals static.  Very good.  Good.  Thank you, buddy.  Let's go to Tim in Jersey.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, morning, guys.  Hey, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Just so you know, I learned that Obie's oatmeal looks like the inside of a horse's sheath.  That was funny.  Thank you, buddy.  Fuck it out.  All right.  Bye, fella.  Rob in Ontario in Toronto. 
[03:54:30]  I learned today that I've been here for seven years and nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Mike from Jersey.  I learned that the horse who had to carry Dreamweaver was more disappointed than Anthony. 
[03:55:00]  Very good.  Let's go to Jared in Jersey.  Jared, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I want to tell you guys what I learned today.  All right.  Go ahead.  Your show sucked during that book segment.  Show sucked during the book segment.  Why?  Because it was fucking boring.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Can't be exciting.  Every moment we're on the radio, you can get a seven cents worth.  Hey, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Later.  It made us laugh like idiots.  Yeah, sometimes it's just about us. 
[03:55:30]  That's so true.  That really was one of my favorite things we've done in months.  Yeah.  Eric in Texas.  What's up?  Hey, I got a word instead of bunt.  What?  It's a fupa.  Yes.  Fat upper pussy area.  Oh, very good.  We've heard that one, sir.  Doughboy from whackbag.com.  I learned that little Jimmy is giving up hookers.  Bunt is my favorite.  Yeah, I like the bunt.  Because you can say it in baseball.  Pat from PA.  You hear him say it on TV.  Hey, Pat. 
[03:56:00]  Yeah, I'm here.  Hey.  What's going on, Pat?  Hey, I learned today that you've been avoiding the truckers.  Tapping out.  We don't avoid the truckers.  We're just trying to educate them a little bit.  Yeah, they like to talk.  They give us some great stories, and we just want to make sure they keep it a little briefer.  They're very chatty.  They're chatty caddies.  I learned the Opie and Anthony book club is shockingly similar to a Hitler Youth rally.  We didn't burn the books.  No.  Jared in Maine, what's up? 
[03:56:30]  I learned today that book tearing is very painful for the stomach.  Book tearing.  I was laughing so fucking hard.  I had to pull off the side of the road.  I understand why the other guy didn't like that.  That was kind of funny.  And then you got Norton really farting.  That wasn't a sound effect.  It made us just lose our minds.  I cut three nice gassers in there while he was listening.  What we do for comedy, I'll tell you.  Because any other time, if he farts in here, I throw a hissy fit.  I need the Lysol.  But it was so in the moment, we had to move on.  Without a doubt.  It was very good for the show. 
[03:57:00]  Well, I wouldn't have done it normally.  Oh, normally you wouldn't have.  No, of course not.  Yes, you would.  I'm farting here all the time, and it's disgusting.  Jim in Boston, what's up?  I learned that Steve's clothing causes panic in crowded areas.  Very nice.  Thank you.  And one more as we just slowly get to the end of the show.  Carl, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Good.  Hi, hot Carl.  I'm glad you're back on the air.  Thank you, Carl. 
[03:57:30]  I learned that you can do a non-gay show.  Yeah, we're getting the gay out.  Okay, terrific.  All right, thank you.  Duke in Jersey.  What's up, Duke?  Duke.  Hey, Duke.  Duke.  Yes.  Go ahead, Duke.  Yeah, I learned that there's a lot of stupid fucking callers today.  My God.  Yuck.  Yeah, I think the callers get about a C-minus today.  Yeah.  Holy shit, they suck a little.  And I think if we're going to be fair here, I think we get about a B to B-minus today. 
[03:58:00]  I gave you an A-plus, Hope.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, you got it.  All right, thank you.  Mitch, what's going on?  Hey, I learned what's over.  Kenny has beautiful eyes.  All right, thank you.  All right, punching out.  We're out of here.  We'll end with this little stupid thing.  Just to get it stuck in your head, and we'll do it again tomorrow, obviously.  Thank you for listening to Opie and Anthony on High Voltage.  Voltage.  High Voltage.  On XM Satellite Radio.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medications?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years. 
[03:58:30]  You've only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Okay, come with me.  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  You've only been here since yesterday.  The medications don't work.  I'm going to have you lie down over here.  I hate this place.  And then we'll get you some medication, okay?  The medications don't work.  Put your right back on your stretcher.  Nothing works here.  All right, I'm here.  I hate this place.  Okay?  Nothing works here.  They're practicing being cruel and unusual. 
[03:59:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I love New York City.  Over there.  New York City.  I love New York City.  Oh, yeah.  New York City.  My wife and I first moved to California.  She was hammering on me about going on one of these whale-watching trips.  Let's get in the boat and go see the whales.  Let's go see the whales.  I'm like, no.  It's a 60-foot animal.  We're in a six-foot rubber boat.  We're a bath toy.  No.  Well, she finally talked me into going. 
[03:59:30]  She didn't talk me into going.  She just said, you're going.  I said, hey.  Sounds good.  So the day of the trip, I'm just whining and moaning.  I don't want to go.  And we're going with these two other California couple friends of ours who are nice people.  But one of the guys is like one of these surfer guys.  He doesn't have a job.  I don't know what he does.  But he thinks I'm his friend because I cut him down.  So we get down on the docks and this guy is like right in my face like, Bill, dude, all right, listen up.  Do you know what would like totally make my day? 
[04:00:00]  I'm like, a G-E-D?  Is that a band?  Dude, if we were out in that boat, all right, this would be so righteous.  If we're out in that boat and a whale went right by the boat, just jump right by the boat.  That would make my day.  I go, do you know what would make my day?  A gun barrel in my mouth.  So we get out in this boat and surf boy gets his wish.  Out of nowhere, this humongous whale comes up right by the boat and goes. 
[04:00:30]  And sprays this nasty liquid all over the boat.  And the Californians are freaking.  They're like, oh my God, he sprayed it.  That is so cool.  I'm like, hello.  He just blew his nose on us is what he did.  We just paid 200 bucks a piece to have a whale honk a loogie on us.  That's all we did.  You know what?  Give me the 200 bucks.  And then the whale made a noise. 
[04:01:00]  It went like, and they lost it.  They're screaming, what do you say?  What do you say?  What do you say?  I'm like, he says, that's what he said.  Which means I just blew snot on him.  I'm going to go tell my friend.  Banks get on my nerves.  And it ain't really the tellers.  I'm just doing my job, sir.  I am just doing my job.  Well, you're sucking at it, lady.  I'll say that.  Well, I've been in Amoco all night. 
[04:01:30]  And now I'm here working at the bank in my other job.  I bounced a check for $3.  Charged me 30 bucks for a $3 check.  Now, if I ain't got three, I damn sure ain't got 33.  This just don't make a whole lot of sense to me.  I had a bank in Atlanta charge you $3 to check the balance in your savings account.  In other words, you walk in and go, how much money I got in this account?  Oh, $300. 
[04:02:00]  Well, $297.  So what you're saying is if I ask you another 99 times how much money I got,  I'll be broke before you go to lunch.  That's what you're saying.
