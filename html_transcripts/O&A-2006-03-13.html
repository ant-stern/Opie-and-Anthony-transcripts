<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio show covered a wide range of topics, often employing vulgar language and offensive humor.  The broadcast opened with Jimmy Norton's anger at being locked out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony despite his agent representing both Metallica (presenters) and Blondie (inductees).  This frustration was repeatedly voiced, alongside complaints about his management.  The hosts also derisively discussed bird flu, comparing it to their show's perceived influence, the "ONA virus."  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to discussing the new *Sopranos* episode, focusing on its shocking ending where Tony Soprano is shot. One host recounted accidentally skipping the crucial scene with his DVR, prompting discussion on the show's pacing, characters, and product placement.  A caller offered positive feedback on a preview of Jimmy Norton's upcoming HBO show, *Lucky Louie*.

The show then transitioned to a St. Patrick's Day broadcast at the Hard Rock Cafe, featuring numerous listener-submitted karaoke clips.  These included "Stalker Paddy" singing "White Rabbit" (described as creepy), Opie's brother singing "Centerfold," and Opie's attempt at "Love on the Rocks," all with poor audio quality. Master Poe’s singing was also briefly mentioned.  A call from Bill Ward of Black Sabbath followed, discussing Black Sabbath's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, their contribution of a damaged drum case top, and his feelings on the honor. He also promoted their upcoming greatest hits CD, mentioning tracks like "Iron Man," "Paranoid," and "Symptom of the Universe," and expressed a preference for the Comedy Cellar over the Gotham Comedy Club. Ward promised to send Opie a memento.  The segment also included a scathing listener email criticizing Jimmy Norton and  an account of Anthony's experiences with vermin in his new home, along with humorous anecdotes about his new neighbors and security system.  The segment culminated in a bizarre call from Mike in Wisconsin who fired his AR-15 through his floor while live on air via Paltalk.  The hosts then revisited their feelings about the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed a promotional skit for a fictional film, "Brokeback Disco."

The Bill Ward interview continued, focusing on Black Sabbath's induction, the band's history, future gigs, and the music industry's challenges.  Opie's lack of a Hall of Fame ticket remained a recurring joke. Following the interview, the hosts and callers debated the merits of various XM radio channels, particularly the "Deep Tracks" and "Big Tracks" channels, criticizing specific artists and songs, including Rush's rap song, Phil Collins' later work, and Lou Reed's music.  A caller recounted shooting a gun in his apartment, damaging his TV and pipes.

The show then shifted to a segment detailing Opie's transformation from a pushover to a more assertive person in the radio industry, fueled by past experiences and illustrated with humorous, often offensive, anecdotes about his time in Cub Scouts.  Opie detailed his angry email to XM Satellite Radio's programming staff regarding audio quality issues, suspecting bandwidth theft and expressing frustration with the lack of a proper response.  This led to a discussion about the distribution of new XM radios, with only two being sent. The hosts then aggressively confronted a listener, “Brian”, who complained about commercial breaks, using insults and threats. The segment also included discussions of an email exchange with XM employees, including Elo, using expletives; a cheerleader performing cheers while on a stretcher; a potential syndication deal that could replace David Lee Roth; and a carbon monoxide poisoning incident from a couple having sex in an idling car.  Jimmy Norton's absence was also briefly addressed.  Jimmy Norton was present in the studio throughout this section.

The show concluded with a highly confrontational call, characterized by extensive use of homophobic slurs ("faggot," "fruitcake"), vulgar insults, sexually explicit jokes, and graphic descriptions. The caller's criticisms prompted a heated exchange, culminating in the caller threatening self-harm and the hosts dismissing him.  The hosts repeatedly used and reworked a joke about wishing someone dies of cancer before a relative's wedding.  Jimmy Norton was not in the studio for this segment.

[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to touch them this time? 
[00:03:30]  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made.  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  We're all in it!  We're all in it!  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh, two so-called radio shots.  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope. 
[00:04:00]  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Shot.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock?  Rock, rock, rock.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I hate this place!  Nothing works here!  The medications don't work! 
[00:04:30]  I've been here for seven years!  Nothing works here!  I hate this place!  Nothing works here!  The medications don't work!  I hate this place!  Nothing works here!  The medications don't work!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Good morning.  Why does my microphone smell like Lysol or something?  Or soap?  That's kind of nice. 
[00:05:30]  Do they spray down the microphones every morning?  Did they wash these?  What is it?  Mine actually looks clean.  Oh, I like this this morning.  It looks and smells clean.  It's so refreshing.  I feel like I just stepped out of a shower.  Yes.  Harvey Harvey.  You're checking out Opie and Anthony on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi, everyone.  Radio.  Radio.  Radio.  We're on Satellite Radio. 
[00:06:00]  It's an ONA virus.  And it's spreading across America.  Slowly but surely.  There's no vaccine for it.  Once the virus is a pandemic.  Much worse than that bird flu they're talking about.  How about that bird flu?  Oh, I'm still pretty scared.  I guess we got a couple more weeks and then we can rest finally.  Well, no, because it's like the killer bee thing that we talked about a while back.  They're saying that it could reach the Americas in a few months. 
[00:06:30]  Because, of course, it's just the rage over there in Asia.  And then a few European nations.  Is it really the rage when one slanty-eyed gets it?  Because he's been working in the bird industry over there, which is what they do.  I don't know.  When does the news tell us that they were just scaring the crap out of us to make us watch their stupid news program?  Well, you wait.  You wait until it gets here.  We should get all the clips from the beginning of the winter. 
[00:07:00]  Right, when they were really geared up to scare everybody about the bird flu.  The stupid bird flu.  There's no bird flu.  No.  The ONA virus, though, very contagious.  We've noticed that a lot of people have been getting it.  I read.  I read.  I read.  I read occasionally.  I do some of that reading.  Some of that reading.  It's like words.  And now the pal talk is taking over the world.  So, you know, we're doing good.  Will we be doing better? 
[00:07:30]  Will they?  They're speculating.  ONA?  I have a nice little article in the Daily News today.  ONA on Satellite Radio.  Hi, Jimmy.  Hi, Hope.  There'll be other things.  Why are you annoyed, Jimmy?  I can tell when you're annoyed.  I've been begging for months.  Today is Sabbath's induction of the Hall of Fame.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  I'm really happy for them, but I'm annoyed for myself because you just, you ask people 
[00:08:00]  for shit and people, you know what it is?  It doesn't affect them personally, so they don't give a fuck.  People in this business do for you when they benefit from it, and that is the reality of  it.  It's unfortunate, but that's the reality of it.  Yeah.  I think that was first discovered and spoken about by Charlie Chaplin back in, yeah, things  never change.  I mean, we got a phone number from Bill today, which is great, which all we got through Kevin  and Sanctuary, which is, you know, we're very happy about that.  And the band's not doing a lot of press, so that's fine.  But I can't get into that fucking Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
[00:08:30]  Metallica is presenting the award, presenting whatever they're doing on the Sabbath.  Blondie's being inducted.  I have the same agent, personal appearance-wise, as Metallica and Blondie.  I'm with the same agency they are, and I can't get in.  Well, I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Are you kidding?  Personal vendetta?  What the hell is going on?  Get Jimmy in!  I've been asking for months, dude, for fucking months.  And when is it?  Today.  It's afternoon. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, shit.  It's not going to happen.  Well, I guess that ain't happening.  No, it's not going to happen.  I knew it wouldn't happen.  I mean, I knew since December it wouldn't happen.  When I found out, or early January.  When I found out.  I think it was January I found out.  Oh, boy.  Everybody yeses you to death.  Yeah, no, we'll check.  Yeah, will ya?  Nothing.  Ugh, I fucking hate it.  My managers?  I mean, look, it's not their job to do this shit.  They got their own lives to live.  I don't expect them to be obsessed with it like I am.  VH1 is filming it.  Some cameraman from VH1 is going to be standing right there, and I can't get in. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know.  Maybe my managers have some kind of connection to Viacom.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Why would you call and ask for a favor like that?  Why would you?  Because it doesn't, you know?  Yeah, but there are times, like, if you have managers and stuff, they got to realize how  important something is to you.  Yeah.  When you ask for 10 things, maybe they would go, yeah, yeah, I'll try to do that for you.  I try, but no luck.  But that one thing, you know, that person really, really wants.  You got to get it done.  Do a little favor triage.  It's like, this one's important.  Got to go right now. 
[00:10:00]  It's like, how many times do you have to fucking ask?  I don't understand.  I just don't get it.  I really don't get it.  I thought it was XM that screwed up.  No, they just didn't.  What were they going to do?  I mean, were they going to do anything for me with this?  Of course not.  I mean, I wouldn't even ask.  Like, how do people get into that?  Like, how do people get in?  Is it all just favors and friends?  I don't know, actually.  I mean, I'm sure there's some guest lists from bands and stuff like that, record label  people.  But I know that the agency, the appearance agency of either Blondie or Metallica would 
[00:10:30]  have the ability to get one person in.  I mean, again, I'm not overstepping by assuming that.  But, you know, and again, I'm not saying my Pete, I think, is trying, but it might be  over his head and he can't do it.  So this is very frustrating.  You know, how many times do you have to fucking ask?  I mean.  Yeah.  And this is a big day for little Jimmy Norton.  Well, for them, it's a big day.  I'm just happy for them.  No, it's a big day for little Jimmy Norton.  Yes.  He's been looking forward to this day for a very long time.  Well, one of the big issues have always been the fact that they were not in the rock and 
[00:11:00]  roll hall.  I refuse to go to it.  I've been screaming about it for years on the air since we've been back.  And again, you know, that's not about Sabbath doing anything about it, but.  And I believe that's one of the reasons they are being inducted is because of your outspokenness.  And now you're being snubbed and not being allowed in.  Were we surprised this would happen?  I mean, is anybody shocked?  No.  No.  I'd be shocked if you were there right now.  Of course.  I'd be stunned if it had worked out and you would be, you would, you were there.  Everybody just yeses. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  No problem.  Yeah.  I'll check that.  Yeah.  Will you?  Yeah.  I don't think that'll be a problem.  Yeah.  I'm on it.  I'm on it.  Don't worry about it.  How could XM Satellite Radio, a major corporation, I guess, not get a press pass?  What?  No one from XM's going?  I'm sure someone's going.  Oh boy.  If someone goes.  I'm sure someone is.  I hear Bob Edwards is going to be doing some political commentary from, uh.  That's just to keep the crowd from standing up and doing anything that would resemble awakeness 
[00:12:00]  during the musical performances.  I love him to sleep.  Well, it's Black Sabbath and, wow, Blondie.  That's good company.  Blondie and Leonard Skinner and there's one other, uh.  Skinner, man.  Oh, Skinner's going in?  See, now I want to go.  That's what we get.  Danny, you're crazy, man.  The useless press passes.  Danny's enjoying this, so he decided to hand Jimmy Norton a press pass.  Did he?  A fake press pass.  Oh, a bear versus guy?  Is this, uh, good footage?  Nah, this is like, uh. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, is that?  Oh, that's just, uh, weekend at Steve's house.  Sorry.  I thought, uh.  It looked like a bear attack, but it's nothing.  It's man versus bear.  Wrestling.  So.  Great.  That's what the bear wants to do.  So what are we going to do for little Jimmy Norton?  Dude, there's nothing you can do.  I mean, I've been screaming about, or asking about this for months.  But I want to do something.  And that press pass that stupid just handed me is more than anybody else has done.  Has done, right.  And I don't know what I expect people to do. 
[00:13:00]  I don't know.  I don't expect people to make mountains move.  But we're in New York.  It's at the Waldorf.  It's not that far away.  I don't know.  Somebody could have done something.  Jimmy.  Yes, sweetie.  Ain't no mountain high enough.  Hey, wait a minute.  Ain't no mountain high enough.  This is at the Waldorf in New York?  Yeah.  I thought you had to go to Cleveland.  No.  No, because they.  This is happening in New York, bro.  They're all in New York now.  You're a silly, silly man.  I have no idea.  No one wants to fly to Cleveland this time of year, so they do it in New York.  Don't scare me.  Everybody's in New York right now. 
[00:13:30]  Everyone's in New York.  It's in New York?  Everybody is in New York.  It's like two miles from here, and Jimmy can't go.  If Jimmy Norton does not make it in there.  You know who?  Earl may be able to get me a pass for the press box.  But that's not even in the ballroom.  And I'm not shitting on Earl.  If he can do that, that's great.  But, I mean, to have to go to Earl for a press box thing where it's just going to be crowded  with fucking reporters, what, what, stand next to David Hinckley so they can talk during  the ceremony and not fucking enjoy it?  Because Metallica's playing Sabbath songs. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  That's who you want to stand next to.  And they'll all be jizz bags sitting in the ballroom.  None of them are going to enjoy it.  A bunch of fucking too cool for the room motherfuckers.  None of them are going to enjoy it.  Yeah.  Sitting with their legs crossed.  And they'll tap their toes.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy's a psycho.  I didn't know it was that close.  Say, silly me.  At the Waldorf.  You're right here.  They're not allowing stalkers into the ceremony, Jimmy.  Nah, but I handle myself well.  It's press people and it's like...  Bores.  The who's who of the rock and roll world.  Bores, right. 
[00:14:30]  Exactly.  Bores.  Bores and people that just don't really care about it.  They just want to be seen there.  Well, they have to be there for work.  Or have to be there, right.  Somebody from Rolling Stone will show up and give some day.  And they'll read off the paper.  And they have been known for such hit, really.  Have they?  You fucking dumb motherfucker.  Where were you five years ago?  Ten years ago, inducted them.  Where were you?  Well, the rock and roll induction ceremonies happens today.  You want to hear the names of the bands?  Yeah.  Black Sabbath, Blondie, Miles Davis.  They're finally going to put Miles Davis in there. 
[00:15:00]  He should have been in there years ago.  He was the oddest colored black man ever.  He looked like a black man that had been bronzed.  And not like they bronzed him like his trumpet.  Really was a talking baby shoe.  Does anyone take this whole thing seriously?  I know you want to go because you're a Sabbath fan.  Because I love Sabbath, man.  But yeah, not really.  I mean, it's nice to have recognition.  I mean, the rock and roll induction ceremony, every band is going to make it eventually.  Eventually, every band will be in there. 
[00:15:30]  Every band.  Every band that was on the radio will make it.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are proud to induct A-Ha into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And just a little known fact, A-Ha flew into the ceremonies in their flying cars.  Uh-huh.  Because that's how long it's going to take.  Unbelievable.  Oh, wait.  This just in.  This just in.  How come I can't get an autographed picture from Opie and Anthony, Ron and Fez, FedExed 
[00:16:00]  me autographed pictures and a t-shirt and a mouse pad, and didn't even want one from  them, wanted it from Opie and Anthony.  I sent Steve all my info.  Do I need to do it again?  Really?  Sorry to keep bothering you, but it really means a lot to me.  And that's from Rubik's Cube 3006.  He just IM'd me on PalTalk with that.  How about that?  Wow.  Rubik's Cube 3006. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, admins?  I don't even want him banned.  Find out where he lives and kill him.  Could you go to his house and kill him?  Murder him at his house.  Calm down.  Holy shit.  Calm down, Uncle June.  You fucking psycho.  Anthony's quickly turning into Uncle June.  I can't.  Stop it.  He's IMing.  Who is it?  He's IMing me about the bohack job.  Maliki. 
[00:17:00]  Whatever the fuck that Italian was.  Who cares?  We'll get into that in a few minutes.  And I'm doing Arabic.  What was it?  Something about Maliki.  I didn't study my Italian enough.  Anyway, the other bands, Miles Davis, Leonard Skinner, Sex Pistols, and they're going to be crazy and not even show, right?  That's what they're saying.  Who?  Sex Pistols?  Yeah, they don't want anything to do with it, so they're not showing up.  Man.  Man.  We're not doing that, man.  We don't agree with your ceremonies, man. 
[00:17:30]  How silly do they look now, though?  They've got to be old guys, right?  I don't know.  You can't be the Sex Pistols and get up on stage and, you know.  And, finally.  Black Sabbath, you can be, you know, an older guy, been around for a while, still playing and stuff, but the Sex Pistols, you think of as the young ruffians.  And then they get up there and, uh.  And, finally, the Rock and Roll Museum needs Herb Albert and Jerry Moss. 
[00:18:00]  Herb Albert?  What about the Tijuana Brass?  Are they with him?  No, just Jerry Moss.  Who's Jerry Moss?  No, Herb Albert and the Tijuana Brass.  That's who Herb Albert was with.  But it's Herb Albert and Jerry Moss.  I don't know who Jerry Moss is.  Do we have a Herb Albert and Jerry Moss song?  It's for non-performers.  Huh?  It's the non-performer category, the Lifetime Achievement.  Non-performer?  Non-performer.  Oh, so not for his performance, but for his other things.  Were they producers?  That he has done.  All right.  Herb Albert did a song you would recognize, one of those, um, just, um, instrumentals on a, uh, on a trumpet. 
[00:18:30]  Wasn't that Chuck Mangione?  Uh, they all have them.  Every generation has them, don't they?  Kenny G.  Give me a Herb Albert song.  You got any Herb Albert there, Derek?  Herb Albert and the...  Yeah.  Which one is this?  Oh, see?  Ladies and gentlemen, he's a game show music guy.  Wait, what game show is this again?  The Dating Game or Newlyweds?  Dating Game.  Wow, this is Herb Albert. 
[00:19:00]  Isn't this catchy?  Yeah.  I would drive to this.  What exit are you going to get off of today?  It could be exit 36.  I hope he performs this.  And I hope they hand out rotted fruit and softballs.  Pelt his aging skull with.  Hey, is it true that Black Sabbath's old drummer can't even get in today?  What?  Someone just hung up as I was going to them.  Their old drummer.  That's what he...  That's...  I don't know.  No, no, no.  They've had one drummer.  It's Bill Ward, and he's calling in today. 
[00:19:30]  All right.  But they're saying Black Sabbath's old drummer can't even get in today.  Unless it was a guy...  I think it was Vinny...  How do you say his name?  Appacy?  Vinny Appacy?  Carmine and Vinny Appacy.  I think it was Vinny who played for Sabbath at one point.  Maybe more of those guys.  I would say it was Vinny Appacy.  Probably couldn't get in.  I bet he can't get in.  Vinny Appacy?  I have no idea.  I don't either.  I don't care less.  I don't.  Let's go to Starch from Whackbag.  Starch!  Hey, I bet you XM sent Christine to do some of her fine interviews over there at the Rock  and Roll Haunt fans. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, we're going to get...  Broad-minded.  Oh, hey.  Maybe broad-minded.  Guaranteed XM has somebody going.  Well, they could have done something, but why would they?  Are we going to get...  They could have done anything.  Are we going to get a nice report from the ceremonies?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Jimmy could have been there.  I'm absolutely leaking clear stuff here.  Yeah, I am an ass, but I would have handled it well.  Well, we'll try to figure something out.  I don't know.  Can we get Lee Abrams on the phone, see?  I think Lee tried, man.  He did try?  I think he did.  He was trying to get the band in, I think, and I don't think they're doing anything as 
[00:20:30]  a group.  I know Tony hates waking up early, and I don't blame him, so a lot of them aren't doing  morning stuff.  Well, let's get Lee Abrams on the phone and see if there's anything he can do last minute.  Let's see if we can get that done.  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, Herb Albert and Jerry Moss own A&M Records.  That's why they're going.  A is Albert, and M would be Moss.  A&M Records.  How about that?  I remember seeing an A&M spinning a few times on the turntable when I was a kid.  They were also responsible for everything after, uh, shit, I can't think of the time 
[00:21:00]  to go P.M. to A.M.  That's so stupid.  Everything after, um...  11.59 P.M.  Right.  There you go.  You were going to say noon.  Yes, I was.  That would have been really silly.  That's why I didn't, but I'd rather stop and almost bomb and completely drive right  into the flaming wreckage.  There you go.  Jimmy's, uh, he's happy now.  A little happier.  I slept for an hour and a half last night.  I was so depressed and irritated.  I could just see you lying on your back, just looking at the ceiling, annoyed. 
[00:21:30]  Just aggravated.  Yeah?  Yeah, it's like, you fucking...  Could you jerk off, or were you...  I tried to, but I couldn't even dump.  I was so irritated.  You can't depend on anyone.  Dude, you really can't.  Because then you're always let down in the end.  Always.  I don't, uh, I flew home a day early, just so I would not miss...  Because we're supposed to meet, believe it or not, Tony Iommi after for this, uh, because  he wants to do a show at XM, and so does Bill Ward, and, uh, I would love to do, like, 
[00:22:00]  at least a one-time thing with him, so I'm very thrilled about that.  That's thanks to Sanctuary Records, and, you know, Steve C. hooked that up, because  Steve C. is, you know, fucking reliable.  He does what he said he's going to do.  Yes, I do.  Yeah, because he's too paranoid.  I'm not saying he's not an ass as a human being.  He gets things done for us, because he's paranoid that he's not doing a good job for us.  This guy works 22 and a half hours a day, and he thinks he's going to get fired any day.  And he probably will and should be.  I'm not saying he's not an incompetent who deserves nothing, but Steve C., when he says 
[00:22:30]  he's going to try something for you, at least tries it.  Steve is honest about that.  He doesn't yes you to death.  He does what he says he's going to do.  Yeah, he's a stand-up guy, that's for sure.  Steve is righteous.  Isn't he righteous?  He is.  All right.  Righteous man.  It's a good word for Steve.  We should move on to other things.  So I assume...  What is right?  Oh, sorry.  What happened?  I thought righteous meant complete ass.  See, I learned something new.  You'll never get a compliment out of me.  We should move on to other things here.  I guess all of America saw The Sopranos last night, right? 
[00:23:00]  Of course.  Probably.  Are the ratings in?  How did it do?  It did a 7.2.  You're just pulling numbers out of your ass, aren't you?  Yes, you are.  It probably did very well after a two-year absence, was it?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  How did they get away with that shit?  I don't know.  Is it two years?  At least two years.  How could any form of entertainment be off for two years, expect to come back to any kind 
[00:23:30]  of audience?  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, but they do it time and time again.  Yeah, I know.  And you can't get into the characters after being away from it for so long.  That recap they had at the beginning was a poor attempt to jog our memories.  I didn't remember half the crap.  I'm looking going, who the, what the, I'm rewinding the recap, because I don't, I can't,  I'm like, who is that guy?  Where did this guy come from? 
[00:24:00]  I don't even remember Tony and Carmelo, whatever her freaking name is, getting back together.  No, that was like a little thing.  Beginning of season five, right?  Oh, who the fuck even knows what season it is.  I thought she was going to kill him or something.  Yeah.  I knew.  Yeah, and things were really bad.  And then they start up this season, things are really good.  They're earning, I guess a year had gone by.  That's in Sopranos time.  And things are good.  The business is good.  They're earning. 
[00:24:30]  They're out of trouble.  You know what I realized last night?  I just don't like the Sopranos.  Is that it?  I try to follow the hype, and I'm like, you know what?  I can't be bothered with this horse shit.  I'm still there.  They still have me.  I know that's sacrilege and all, but I can't be bothered.  It's the slowest moving fucking show.  It is.  It is so slow.  They set up for the big end payoff, and then the next episode is a setup for the end payoff. 
[00:25:00]  It's become that.  And they still got me hooked.  I'll watch the entire series.  And you know what?  I was watching Sopranos last night, and I was sort of getting into it because of the hype,  you know, and it's the season premiere, and I'm like, all right, this is all right.  You know, it's kind of exciting.  The Sopranos hasn't been on in a while.  And then he's in the fucking doctor's office.  Thank God that didn't last very long.  But I'm like, oh, fuck, that's right.  Now I remember why I hate this show.  I did the same thing you did when that scene came on.  I think you heard a collective, oh, oh, my God. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, enough with the Melfi shit.  The Melfi shit is not working anymore.  Write it out.  Write it out of the fucking show, please.  It's distracting.  It's irrelevant.  It's one of those things that, you know, there have been plenty of series that started out  with something, and then later on, that character or event or situation went away.  I wish I could think of one now.  Happy Days, Chuck.  Chuck from Happy Days.  Thank you, Jimmy Norton. 
[00:26:00]  Chuck from Happy Days was treated just like Jimmy at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Bye-bye.  He'd gotten and tossed to the wayside.  And then everything continued as if he didn't exist.  Right.  Exactly.  That's the type of situation this Dr. Melfi thing is.  Just get rid of it.  It doesn't work.  It worked for the first couple of seasons to show that Tony's mentally a little fucked up.  Now we know.  We get it.  We know.  All right.  We don't have to revisit it where she recaps what they talked about in, like, when he  had problems in season three, I think it was, or two, or I don't even know. 
[00:26:30]  Who cares about Dr. Melfi?  And she's not good.  Lorraine Bracco is not-  She stinks.  She's awful in that role.  She's a stiff, terrible-  Why do you think?  I don't know.  Half-deaf voice.  Doesn't your mother-  Don't you understand she didn't love you?  Ugh.  Stop it.  Didn't you try to smother your own mother?  All right.  We remember.  Shut up.  She's terrible.  And she's-  Ugh.  Her legs crossed trying to look sexy. 
[00:27:00]  And she's a real cougar, let me tell you.  And trying to do the whole, uh, the detached therapist voice.  Lorraine Bracco stinks.  I'm sorry.  In Goodfellas, she was fine, because you could be awful in that role, and for some reason it  worked.  So they were gonna fight it, Henry!  I'll bet the script said calmly.  I'll bet you in the script it said calmly.  Yeah.  Horrid delivery.  Can I, uh, can I tell you guys what happened last night?  And then he pushed me out of the car!  He's-  He's touched me! 
[00:27:30]  I asked him not to!  He did it!  He should have beat her with the pistol.  He certainly should have.  And the script.  Ha ha ha ha!  Can I, uh, can I tell you what happened to me last night?  Yeah.  So I'm watching The Sopranos, right?  And to me, I was just like, whatever.  This is boring, you know?  And, um, I had to pause the, you know, the HBO, because, uh, whatever.  I had to go do something.  Take a leak or something.  Whatever.  Which is great.  I love the DVR feature.  Pause.  Not at your mercy anymore.  Right.  So it's key to this story. 
[00:28:00]  So I paused it at some point to get up and do something.  And I put the remote under my mattress pillow.  Yeah.  I got a mattress pillow, so, you know, the remote ends up in bed, and in the middle of  the night, it falls on the floor and scares the shit.  Always falls on the floor.  So.  What's a mattress pillow?  What is that?  Just a huge mattress pillow.  Oh, it makes it nice and makes your, uh, sleep, uh, wonderful.  You don't have a pillow top mattress?  Well, that's what I mean.  Whatever.  Oh, no, no, no.  It's an airline.  Oh, yeah.  I do have that, too.  But now I have something else on top of that.  Why don't you just buy a womb and crawl into that? 
[00:28:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  That's what I'm trying to do.  Trust me.  I want to just start all over.  Ha ha ha ha!  But, uh, and so I, I, I put the remote under the mattress pillow so it doesn't fall on  the floor in the middle of the night when you fall asleep with the TV on or whatever,  right?  So, uh, I swear to you, this is what happened to me last night.  Um, Tony goes over to Uncle, uh, Junior's house there to do the cooking and see if he's  okay, right?  Toward the end of the show, right?  Toward the end of the show.  And all I, all I saw was, um, Tony cooking. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Right?  And I get up to adjust myself.  Uh, and I, and I, I guess I pushed down the mattress pillow.  Oh, no.  I changed the channel.  Oh, no.  It goes back to live.  Which is a no-no with the, the old DVR system.  You lose your delay that you built up when you, uh, when you paused it.  I swear to you, this is what happened.  So I adjust myself, just as he's making the sauce or whatever, what he's doing, cooking  on the stove, uh, the channel changes.  I go, no!  And I turn back.  And all I see is Tony on the floor. 
[00:29:30]  I swear to you, this is what happened to me last night.  You missed everything.  With red on his hand, and he's reaching for the phone, obviously something happened, right?  Dude, I-  Yes, something.  Not-  The payoff to the whole episode.  I understand.  Well, you explained it to me in the office.  But at this point, I'm like, well, is that spaghetti sauce on his hand?  Did he have some kind of, like, one of those episodes that he's had in past episodes?  Yeah.  You have no clue.  And fell down, and now he's reaching for the phone.  I had no idea that he was shot.  No idea.  Oh, my God. 
[00:30:00]  Until this morning when I, I ran into the office and said, okay, what happened?  What happened?  Because, and, and explained to you guys what happened.  Oh, no.  That is probably the worst place you could have gone.  The worst luck, right?  From, uh, Delayed Alive.  I just got up and adjusted myself in it, and it pushed down the mattress pillow and changed  the channel.  You got to record them.  And changed it back, and there he is just laying on the floor.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You got to be kidding me.  Something huge just happened, and I have no idea.  One thing you got to say about The Sopranos, like, remember we were on an N.E.W.  I had never seen any of them.  And then in our time off, Nick DiPaolo kept yelling at me to see him. 
[00:30:30]  So I've seen the whole thing now.  I forgot it was on last night.  And I like the fact that they will kill off characters that you like.  Like, I do respect that.  Like, they killed off some, and you're like, fuck, why did they do that?  But they will kill off some really interesting, good characters long before they have to.  I tell you, that was a little creepy.  I forgot how great of an episode that was when they killed off, what's her name?  Adriana.  Yeah, Adriana in the woods, because they showed a little of that on the recap.  And she's just, no, no, no, and it's coming.  Silvio just kind of puts a couple in there. 
[00:31:00]  We got the audio of The Scene.  Right.  The Scene.  From The Sopranos last year.  Crazy Uncle Junior.  Here comes a rainstorm.  Put your rubbers on your feet.  Do you have any wine?  Gotcha, the merengue.  Take that. 
[00:31:30]  I want to go on a Superman ride, Tony.  Tony, I want to go on a Superman ride.  Tony, what's with all the moulignons here cutting a line?  Uncle Junior has turned into the guy from the Great Adventure commercial.  Who shot Tony, Uncle Junior?  Uncle Junior, crazy Uncle Junior, runs downstairs because he's senile.  And he thought Tony was some guy he didn't know.  Oh, okay.  And he got sada merengue, boom, shoots him in the guts, 
[00:32:00]  and runs upstairs and hides in the closet,  and then ran out of the house, danced around, and jumped on a bus  and went to an amusement park.  He looks just like the guy.  Does the rest of the country understand that?  Oh, there's Six Flags everywhere.  It was a big campaign for Six Flags.  Good, so they get it.  Yeah.  Holy shit, he's got the big glasses on, the baldy head,  and he looks just like him.  What's with the moulies here? 
[00:32:30]  They're always cutting my line.  I can't get on the Superman ride, Tony.  Shoot somebody.  I buried it right under the Medusa coaster from the bohack job.  It's under the Medusa coaster.  Crazy bastard.  Did you see that coming, though?  Of course you didn't.  You went to live, and you fucked up.  I shouldn't have asked you.  Anybody in the country, I certainly wasn't expecting that to happen.  But Tony, to get shot by Uncle Junior.  Well, you knew something really huge was going to happen. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, I had to.  Because stupid HBO is showing people coming out of the premiere.  Yeah.  And everyone's like, oh, my God, who saw that coming?  Oh, my.  Oh, wow.  A biggie.  So you knew something huge was going to happen at the end of it.  Thank you, HBO, for wrecking that, by the way, in a way.  I think that was a fine promotional job by my friends over there.  Yes.  Right.  Jimmy.  I'm mad about it, Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's fine, dude.  I'm digging it.  I'm still into it.  I think they were trying to force feed a character down our throats last night, though.  Which one? 
[00:33:30]  The guy that hung himself at the end.  Oh, yeah.  Wanted to move out, get out of the mob, move to Florida with his wife and kids.  Can I ask you a stupid question?  Yeah.  Was he part of the Sopranos show before that?  No.  I don't remember seeing that guy.  Yeah, great.  So he's.  He's like a trigger man kind of.  I understand, but they make him look like he was one of the boys just hanging out in the  back room there.  Well, that's why it seems like they were trying to shove him.  If he made an appearance on the Sopranos, it wasn't memorable.  And it must have been it's just some guy on a quick scene in the background because I 
[00:34:00]  don't remember him.  They never got involved with his wife or kids or anything like that.  And all of a sudden, he's getting this major character role in the first episode.  They kind of shoved it down your throat.  Were we supposed to feel anything for this guy when he hangs himself?  What happened to Furio?  And I know he had the thing, the crush on Carmella, but nothing happened.  He's hiding.  He's been hiding for three or four seasons.  He's been hiding.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Because they're so good at tying all the loose ends together. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, my God.  I love the Sopranos for that.  Big frayed mess.  No kidding.  That is.  Let's go to David in Georgia.  David.  I can't believe you guys would sit here and talk this much about Sopranos and not mention  Meadows' little lap dance.  That's not.  She was dancing for her guy.  Well, that was part of.  And the king.  No, my.  No, my.  I don't know what that speech thing was at the beginning of the.  Episode.  It was cool as hell, but I had no idea what they were getting at.  Yeah.  And I.  Yeah.  And I was going to.  I was going to go. 
[00:35:00]  Should I try to figure this out?  I'm like, no, I'm not going to try to figure this out.  It's Sunday night.  I'm tired.  I just want to watch the fucking show.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to deal with that.  And the God Cooler.  What?  Who?  Right.  Waited for.  Huh?  It's talk over our.  As we talk.  Guys.  So I'm just going to talk over him now.  What?  I'm sorry.  What?  I'm just going to sit here and talk over him because this is what he does.  Opie's talking.  And this guy, David from Georgia, just talks over Opie.  All right.  Well, sorry.  You can talk.  All right.  Let David get in.  What he's going to say is that Meadow was dancing for how you fuck. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  She looked very hot doing that lap dance there.  Yeah.  She looked pretty good.  All right.  All right, man.  I think everyone knew she looked hot there.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  I can't believe you guys haven't mentioned the ridiculous amount of product placement last  night.  Yeah.  It started.  I have a little list.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  And hold on, Mike.  Go ahead. 
[00:36:00]  We're going to do a little something here because Anthony goes, yeah.  Yeah.  I swear to you, I did not notice one product.  Really?  Because it wasn't Kashi cereal on the table.  I did not notice one product.  Lean on me.  There was a box of lean on me.  Name one product placement from the Sopranos last night.  Honey Nut O's or what was that cereal?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Maple O's.  Nesquik.  I know it was there.  I saw one case, too.  And then Nesquik.  Yeah.  There was product placement from Terrible Actors Incorporated in Dr. Melfi's office. 
[00:36:30]  All right, Mike.  You got a list?  I got a few things.  I may have missed stuff because I didn't realize it until about 15 minutes in.  Okay.  But here's what I got.  I got the Nesquik at the beginning, naturally.  Couldn't miss that.  Right on the little train set, right?  Yeah.  Then you got the FedEx envelope.  You know, he was so excited to get.  Yep.  Ripping it open.  Then you have the watches.  I forget the name of the manufacturer because I'm poor and I don't know them.  No, was it the sunglasses?  No.  Well, that's coming up.  The watches first, yeah.  The watches from that guy that killed himself, whatever. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Then you had where I think it was Tony or Junior was watching television.  They had to show you a little Philips logo at the bottom of the television.  Yeah.  Then you got the Armani sunglasses.  Then you got Tony talking about the Porsche Cayenne like a salesman.  You know, selling it right to the TV.  Oh, it's got the 4.3.  Yeah, that is true.  So he kind of really went through it like a car salesman.  Exactly.  And then you had, I mean, it may or may not have been, but the woman talking about her  Corvette.  Yeah.  That's about all I got.  But there may have been more, but I was just, you know, kind of into the episode. 
[00:37:30]  I thought it was pretty good.  See, there's a weird thing with product placement.  Like, you know why?  The first time I ever noticed it was in Superman 2, the Marlboro trucks that he was throwing  the monsters or the bad guys' planets through Marlboro trucks.  And a part of it is annoying because it can be distracting, and a part of it is good because  it becomes natural, like the way we live.  Like, remember those awful shows where they're drinking, like, all in the family, they would  drink a yellow beer?  Yeah.  It would just say beer on it.  Or the thing that was red and white Budweiser colors but would just say beer. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  And, of course, the cigarettes from the Brady Bunch, Valiant, with the big V with the circle  on it, Valiant cigarettes.  Those aren't a cigarette, are they?  No.  No.  No.  Yeah.  If they make it look natural, who cares?  I didn't notice, and it didn't take away from my viewing, so.  It just seemed like a sellout to me.  Like, you can tell this is the final season.  You know what, though?  Let them do product placement because I don't want my DVR taken away from me.  I'm watching so much more TV these days.  Yeah.  It's helping my part of this radio show because now I finally watch TV again because I couldn't 
[00:38:30]  sit through commercials anymore.  Nope.  Now you just tape it, DVR it.  You watch a two-hour program in an hour and, what, 30 minutes now?  Yeah.  I don't watch American Idol unless it's DVR'd.  I wait about a half hour.  Exactly.  I watch something else for a half hour, and then I go, and then you get American Idol uncut.  Timed out perfectly.  If you wait a half hour, then you can watch the entire show, and by the time you're done,  you're up to speed, and you haven't watched one goddamn commercial. 
[00:39:00]  Yep.  So.  All right, Mikey.  Thanks, guys.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's go to Kyle in Jersey.  Kyle, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted my lame attempt to make Norton feel better.  I saw the Lucky Louie 12-minute preview.  Looks fucking gold.  Oh, thanks, man.  What's the preview is that?  I don't know.  Somebody posted it on Wackbag, but it looks great.  Oh, thanks, man.  I know that they're sending four episodes, I believe, to the press soon.  Yeah, I didn't want to ruin the episodes. 
[00:39:30]  But that's not standard.  The cast looks great.  I don't know.  It's only standard when they know they got a pretty good show on their hands.  Oh, okay.  I mean, there are times they don't give anything to the press.  Plus, it's rare you have 13 shot before you go to air.  I mean, I don't know what...  No, Lucky Louie's going to be a monster hit for HBO and Lil' Jimmy Norton.  I hope so, man.  But thank you for coming.  Yeah, man, I really hope it does well, because it looks great.  Thanks, buddy.  Thank you.  Let's go to Charlie and Jersey.  Is there going to be a premiere for something, like they did with The Sopranos when it airs?  I don't know, actually, how they're going to do it. 
[00:40:00]  I would hope so.  Are you allowed in?  You know what?  It would be funny.  I probably would not be able to get into that.  I know.  You would think somebody could get me in.  It's funny.  I was working for HBO, and this is just another example of how I belong nowhere.  There was a thing going on.  There was a big party for the Emmys or something, and I realized I wasn't invited to it, and  I was doing a show for them, and the president of the company is a woman who's been very nice  to me, and she's like, yeah, she offered to get me in, but I couldn't, because I was 
[00:40:30]  kind of embarrassed by that point.  I don't have to do that to get in.  Do you think there's a level?  Everybody has a level of wherever they are in life, and no matter where you are, you're  always looking for the next plateau and way in, do you think somebody like Tom Cruise  or De Niro, do you think there's somewhere that they're going, you know, I can't be  part of that, or I can't get into that, or...  Yeah, definitely.  The president and his wife are fucking, and Tom Cruise wants to watch, and Secret Service 
[00:41:00]  stops them.  Actually, is that what happened?  Because it seems like everybody's got their level, and there is that attainable where no  matter what you want, where you want to get into, an event, you're in.  Ben could probably help us out with this.  Bad, though.  As far as trying to get into some of these buildings in Manhattan, there are huge mega  celebrities that can't get into these buildings.  What do you mean, to live?  Yeah.  The co-op boards get involved.  That's kind of different.  We don't want a Tom Cruise or a Madonna in our building.  That's kind of different because of their celebrity. 
[00:41:30]  That's because you're so famous.  Yeah, because you're so famous.  Yeah, I kind of mean, like...  No one has...  Events.  Yeah, Ben.  Dad, dude.  Yeah, the building boards.  Co-op boards.  Co-op boards.  Co-op boards, right?  I was surprised if Jim, like...  But you're in a condo.  Condo.  Like, the buildings, there's a lot of buildings where, like, Derek Jeter and a lot of the players  live in stuff.  They're condos.  Co-op boards, they reject people all the time.  Really?  They don't want the media coverage and stuff like that.  In my case, they don't want friends in wigs.  That's their big excuse, but it doesn't even matter. 
[00:42:00]  They can reject anything.  It's more of a power trip so they can go to their stupid little friends and go, I'm on  the co-op board, and guess what?  I told Derek Jeter he can't live here.  It's a whole power trip thing.  It has nothing to do with them being too famous and the media is going to be camping out these  places.  Well, they take...  They have all your...  They have everything about you.  They know where you work, your financial records.  Show business.  Oh, no.  You do laugh, but, I mean, they're crazy.  It was a nightmare.  It was a nightmare getting into buildings here. 
[00:42:30]  I was chastised by Ben for laughing.  No.  You laugh.  But Ben gave you, like, a 1940s chastising.  Oh, you laugh.  You laugh, but let me tell you, the Nazi party will take over.  That's right.  You stay right there in Warsaw.  Enjoy your red parchment.  Anthony Comewitz.  You laugh.  There's actually something in the paper, though, over the weekend about Trump throwing people  off of his board at the building that Jeter lives on the east side.  Did you hear this story?  For being a little too...  One of the guys was naked on the board.  Yeah, one of the guys is running around the building naked or something. 
[00:43:00]  See, all the rule makers are a bunch of hypocritical asses.  Naked.  What was he doing naked?  Or someone came to fix an appliance or something?  I forget the story.  I just read the headline, the first paragraph, and I was laughing pretty hard.  When he opened the door naked, he was, like, a sex addict to someone?  Yeah, it's a building that Matsui and Jeter live in on the east side of the Trump building.  This is a guy that's really strict on the board, and it turns out he likes to be naked,  and I don't know, all sorts of allegations.  They're trying to kill another board member. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he chased him around, threatened to kill him over something he wanted to do to his apartment.  It was a great story.  Wonderful.  Yeah, so...  Jesus.  They just get into your stupid little lives.  Yeah.  Let's go to Charlie in Jersey.  Charlie!  Morning, guys.  Hey, Charlie.  Do you guys happen to catch the biggest tease of all from last night's episode?  What was that?  They didn't show any previews for next week's show.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, because they want you to think that maybe Tony's going to die.  It would be Tony in the hospital.  Who's buying the fact that Tony's dying? 
[00:44:00]  First episode.  First episode.  They kill him off.  Maybe they'll do it later in the year or something.  Who knows?  But, I mean, he's not dying after the first episode.  Here's what I see.  In the hospital, it's one of those they don't know if he's going to live or die, and there's  going to be this big conflict within the group there on who's going to take over and kind  of going to vie for power and shit like that.  And then the third episode will fast forward 16 months or something stupid like that.  He'll be out breathing heavy and eating.  Oh, you're looking good.  You're up and about, huh?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's go to Mike in New York City.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  Based on the miracle of the internet, you can read the first three episodes of Obsis.  Now you're going to blow up for anybody.  But another reason they didn't show previews is next week's episode is one of the...  No spoiler for me.  I'm not listening.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  No, no, no.  It's the complete deal.  It's one of those stupid stand-alones that has nothing to do with the storyline.  So you're going to have to wait two weeks on that about Tony.  So they're not going to even have Tony in the next episode?  Oh, is that...  It's like some stupid side plot thing that you'll never... 
[00:45:00]  It has nothing to do with Tony getting shot or anything like that.  That's not what I heard, dude.  I heard that they go through the whole thing, and then Tony dies and comes back to life,  and then the rest of the season's about genetic cloning.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Eric?  Hey, guys.  Hey, two things on The Sopranos.  Did you notice that last night's episode seemed to be filmed real dark?  Very dark, yeah.  I thought my new TV was fucked up.  I was pissed.  And I think that helped make the episode more enjoyable. 
[00:45:30]  But I'll tell you something else.  There's a talk radio guy out here in Colorado.  He has some guy named, this guy's first name is Alan.  I forget what his last name is.  He's written a lot of The Sopranos books, and he's real good friends with David Chase.  And they were interviewing him last Friday.  One of the reasons why it takes so long between seasons is David Chase is such a perfectionist.  There are some of the scripts and whatnot he has rewritten four and five times.  Perfectionist.  He's not a perfectionist.  He has a mental disorder. 
[00:46:00]  Well, that's possible, too.  They pumped out all in the families every week for years.  I don't want to hear it.  I'm sick of hearing that David Chase is this perfectionist and he's a genius.  No, he has some kind of mental fucking disorder, but he's good enough where they're like,  we have to just deal with this shit.  Nine years, Seinfeld.  Because he gives us this good TV.  Norman Lear was doing like 60 pages a week.  And I'm not just saying that because Norman saw my show and I got to chat with him.  He was a notoriously, what's the word? 
[00:46:30]  You put a lot of material.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Hold on, hold on.  What's the word?  Thank you.  Prolific.  Yeah, he was prolific with that.  Fan.  I'm so sick of them saying David Chase is this perfectionist.  No, he's not.  He's got a fucking problem.  Stop it.  He leaves loose ends and takes a lot of vacation time.  That's what he does.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Hey, a friend of mine worked at Event Security up there in Aspen over the weekend.  And he said you fucking killed.  He said you were just really good.  Thank you, man.  Appreciate it.  Thank you, Eric.  You're welcome.  Do you have any friends that work at Event Security at the Wardorf? 
[00:47:00]  Let me know.  On stage or on the slopes?  Hey, I didn't even know if you were talking about it.  I really wanted to go.  I wish you would have promoted it sooner that you were going to be there.  Where?  Because it sold out so fast.  What did?  Are you tired of Eric from Colorado?  I don't know what he's talking about.  I'm really tired of him.  He's calling from Colorado.  Eric, he's giving you a problem.  I was with him.  No, but he said something sold out.  I didn't hear him.  He's from Colorado, and he wished he knew that you were going to be there sooner.  He was going to go and see you.  Oh.  Because we're a national show.  In Aspen.  That's in Colorado.  Oh. 
[00:47:30]  But the shows weren't sold out.  They were very good, but that's the festival.  He tried to get in, and he couldn't get in.  He could have made it.  So something was going on.  That's all.  That's all he was saying.  He was being nice, and I don't know.  I met some guy who was a big ONA fan, and I don't remember your name, sir.  I blocked it out like it was a childhood episode.  And he shook my hand 30 times.  He was one of those lunatics.  Like, no, every 30 seconds walks up with that stupid dick beater out, and you have to, all  right, here's some more human contact. 
[00:48:00]  Dick beater.  Every 30 seconds.  Dude, I know.  Thank you.  Up, down, up, down.  Remove.  Wipe on my fucking, that fucking clammy mitt.  How many times did we have to touch each other?  Your fucking, your cadaver foot hand really irritated me.  Clammy cold.  I wouldn't want to touch that hand if it was fucking handing me an all-access badge for  the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.  That's great.  Let's go to Jimmy in Illinois. 
[00:48:30]  Jimmy, what's up?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was just wondering, since we're on a topic of things that take two years to get  to you, if I could ask Norris, where's the CD I ordered from his website like a month  ago?  Sometimes they get a little backed up, dude.  That will get to you.  They're very good.  But, you know, occasionally they do get backed up.  Okay.  I was just wondering where, what was going on with it.  Where are you calling from?  I'm going to see, because they said there was a couple orders.  What's your name?  Your first name?  My name is Jimmy.  I'm in Chicago.  Oh, you know what happened?  They said that that one might have gotten delayed because it was a strike. 
[00:49:00]  Jimmy.  Exactly.  Click.  Wow.  I must say, the callers are catching on quickly today.  It only took them 40 minutes to hang up.  They're hanging up.  By the way, Kelly Force from Gainesville, Florida, writes on the Instant Feedback, excuse  me, it's Alpert, not Albert.  Alpert with a P.  What is...  Sorry.  Who cares? 
[00:49:30]  Oh, Alpert, I thought so.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Stupid cunt.  With an O.  Pitch.  Is it really Alpert?  I wouldn't know.  Alpert.  Yeah.  Alpert.  Alpert.  That's stupid.  Just flip it upside down.  It's Alpert.  No one's looking.  Put a Doc Martin in our bussy.  Actually, I apologize because that was the first one of 10 saying the exact same thing  on Instant Feedback. 
[00:50:00]  So, I guess it's a known fact that it's Alpert.  Alpert.  Instead of Albert.  All right.  Why don't we take a break and continue with the O&A show.  We got lots to do today.  Anthony moved into his fine new house.  Ah, finally.  And, uh...  I got new neighbors.  It's wonderful.  Ugh.  New house.  They bring you food that you're not going to eat?  Pee.  No, I haven't gotten the welcome wagon thing yet.  I'm thinking I should, though.  Shouldn't I?  No.  Shouldn't they come?  Hi.  No.  And, uh...  We'll talk about that.  And, yes, the rumors are true. 
[00:50:30]  Good old Alan Sniffen from the New York Radio Message Board had a nice scoop.  And now, uh, the Daily News is writing about it.  Uh-oh.  We have to address it?  I don't know if we have to address it.  What can we say?  We'll, uh, we'll figure that out next.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Go to OpieandAnthony.com. 
[00:51:00]  We have, uh, some video clips from, uh, the late night karaoke we did about a week ago.  You can see Anthony singing Sweet Caroline.  Ah, what a classic.  You can see Master Post singing My Love.  And doing a pretty good job with it, by the way.  Also, you can see, uh, our own Danny singing War Pigs.  Yes.  Starker Patty doing a great job with White Rabbit.  Creepiest version ever.  It's a perfect song for her, though.  She pulls it off. 
[00:51:30]  And then my brother singing, uh, Centerfold.  Now, that's scary.  He's a complete lunatic, and he did his own version of Centerfold.  All the videos are up on OpieandAnthony.com.  And I guess, uh, all these people will be singing at the Hard Rock Cafe this Friday when we do our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  Are you going to do Sweet Caroline?  Uh, you know, I get caught up in the moment when I see a karaoke machine like that, and yeah, Neil just comes out in me.  Because we're going to do it for...  Maybe I'll do Love on the Rocks.  We're going to do it for the whole country. 
[00:52:00]  Pour me a drink, and I'll tell you some lies.  Yeah, he'll be doing it.  Anthony's a ham.  Is Neil in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  You're such a ham.  He really is.  No.  I am.  That's such a good word.  Cloves, pineapple in me.  That's it.  I want to see Stalker Paddy doing, uh, White Rabbit.  So, we got a lot of fun.  One pill makes you larger, the other makes you small, and the one that mother gives you,  don't do anything at all.  I don't know if the...  We got some audio, but I don't know if it's going to do, uh, do the song justice. 
[00:52:30]  Because it's from a video camera.  The place was mobbed.  It's the live version.  A man.  And those tiny, tiny, tiny little microphones, they just can't...  They can't get the job done.  They can't distinguish from the crowd and the, uh, singing.  Well, we'll give you a little taste.  Paddy!  Paddy!  Paddy!  Paddy!  Ah, she's a freak.  What do you want me to do?  Thank you!  Thank you.  That's a big...  Animals. 
[00:53:00]  Hell!  We want me to do it in sin!  However, what do you want me to do?!  We want me to do?  We've taken down from respectable MSlock.  Ben?  Hi.  We have tried!  Ready?  Get him, Max!  Hello?  Hello?  The man who already got your face with me!  And the one sad mother gives you 
[00:53:30]  Don't do it all  It's really hard to hear, obviously.  As if you go chase the rabbits.  But you'll do it for everybody this Friday  at the Hard Rock Cafe here in New York City  for our St. Paddy's Day broadcast.  It starts at 11 a.m. on the East Coast. 
[00:54:00]  Yes, it does.  I wish we had better audio  because she really did a great job with that.  She tore it up, yo.  And Master Poe with his very dainty singing voice.  There's a lover and a fighter at odds in that body, isn't there?  Well, we could try this, too.  A few other things.  Here's Master Poe doing my love.  Just a little taste.  No.  I think I threw the wrong CD in.  Almost tasted something we didn't want. 
[00:54:30]  Come on.  All in eight body roll!  That's the battle cry.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  What are you doing?  It's of course!  Yeah!  I've been through so many changes in my life.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, no. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  Oh, my.  I need my sugar.  My sugar is by my side.  My love.  So there you go.  I tasted that.  There he goes.  It's just too distorted to really get into it, unfortunately.  But you'll hear it on the radio Friday, crystal clear.  Yep.  Or at the event if you show up, okay? 
[00:55:30]  Can't wait for that one.  I don't know if I should read this, but there's an instant feedback about you, Jimmy.  Eric from Whackbag.  He writes, Jimmy's such a fucking spoiled brat.  Wah!  With ten H's.  Oh, shit.  I can't.  All right.  All right.  Buckle up, kids.  I don't know why I'm doing this.  Go ahead.  No, no.  Read it.  Good.  Let Eric from Whackbag.  Go ahead.  All right.  Jimmy's such a fucking spoiled brat.  Wah!  With ten H's.  I can't see Ozzy for the hundredth time. 
[00:56:00]  Fucking appreciate what you've gotten instead of crying about what you can't get, you fucking  baby.  First of all, douchebag, I've acknowledged that I've gotten to meet the guys and I'm really  happy.  What I'm talking about is why I can't get into an event that I should be able to get into.  Stupid.  I'm not talking about meeting Ozzy.  I'm not complaining that Ozzy's not on the show.  I'm not ungrateful that I haven't met Sabbath.  I'm very grateful that I've met Sabbath.  But as a fan, as somebody who has been screaming and has been very vocal on the air about it,  and having the same agent as two of the bands that are going to be there, I don't think 
[00:56:30]  it's uncalled for for me to want to get in there, Eric, from a fucking website name.  Douchebag.  Yeah.  So go fuck your mother with ten R's.  I'm proud of you, Jimmy.  You kept it together there.  Yeah, please.  Some fucking douchebag.  They're typing.  I can't.  I'm so worried about getting into this thing, and I know I'm not going to.  All right.  We've got Bill Ward calling in in what, ten minutes? 
[00:57:00]  8.45, I believe.  Oh, 8.45.  I thought it was 8.15.  All right.  So later this hour, Bill Ward from Black Sabbath.  Nice.  We'll talk to him.  Let's go to Brad in Atlanta.  Brad, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I'm just calling in to wish Jimmy luck on his show this weekend.  I'm going to be there.  If anybody doesn't know, it's the Punchline in Atlanta, Georgia, the 16th, 17th, and 18th.  8.45, 404-252-LAFF.  Punch it out.  That's nice of you.  Hey.  Look at that.  A little plug-a-rooney. 
[00:57:30]  I haven't even made a commercial for that.  I've been so distracted.  How dope I am.  All right.  Anthony moved into his new house.  Yes.  Congratulations, Anthony.  Finally.  Thank you, Opie.  I am what they call a homeowner now.  I'm a homeowner, not a renter anymore.  I've rented my whole life.  I was thinking about you at 3.30 in the morning this morning.  Why?  Well, because I heard the mice and the rats and who knows.  It sounds like a squirrel also is living in between the ceiling and the floor. 
[00:58:00]  Oh, boy.  I had one of those in a rental house once, and I just fired a bunch of 22 rounds into the sound.  I didn't have anybody living up above me, don't get me wrong.  It was a house out on Long Island, and apparently some squirrels have gotten in between the ceiling  and whatever the hell else was up there, the attic.  So it was in a vestibule-type area, so no mechanical equipment or pipes or anything above it,  but they were nesting in there.  And it would drip through urine and shit in this vestibule, and I'd hear them. 
[00:58:30]  So I got the old Ruger 22.  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  Just left them dead up there.  What were they?  Were they rats?  Yeah, they were squirrels.  Well, I got something going on, man.  I haven't heard them in a while, but they were just rocking and rolling.  Yeah.  Running from one side of the room to the other.  That's fantastic.  In between the ceiling and the floorboards upstairs.  And my landlord wants me to sign a lease.  Landlords are pricks. 
[00:59:00]  I'm like, you take care of the freaking mice, and all right, I'll hang out there for a little  longer as I try to find my own palace.  Yeah.  So I was thinking about it this morning because it woke me up again, and I'm like, fucking  Anthony is sleeping in his brand new house tonight, and I have to deal with this shit  still.  Brand new house.  They're just clawing and running and fighting.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  How many are up there?  You ought to videotape that and get audio of it, and then put it on the web, and put  your address when you move out.  I'm thinking of just, when I do leave, I'm thinking of just poking one little hole. 
[00:59:30]  Let them all just get out?  Yeah, absolutely, because they're contained in there.  What's the matter, Mr. Pratt?  Bugs got your tongue?  The room just looks like that, full of roaches.  That's what I'm going to do.  Just a little subtle hole, just enough, so now they could run around the entire apartment,  because they are definitely not getting into the apartment.  They get into the kitchen every once in a while, and I've been zapping the  hell out of them.  I haven't caught one in a while.  Yeah.  I'm up to like 15 kills.  15 fucking...  Wow, 15 confirmed kills? 
[01:00:00]  Oh yeah, confirmed.  Wow.  Confirmed.  Like a mouse serial killer.  And then there's a bunch of mice that got away where they were able to get the food  and stuff and scurry away, but I got 15 confirmed kills.  Those electric mousetraps that someone sent us, I forget the guy's name.  A miracle.  It's just un-fucking-believable how great they were.  What does your landlord say when you tell him I've killed 15 of these things?  Dude, he's got all sorts of problems.  There's notices hanging in the lobby now from the fire department.  Oh great, that's what you need.  So I don't know, he's got his own problems right now. 
[01:00:30]  It's time, Opie.  It's time.  Venture out.  I've been looking.  I can't find anything yet.  You're not going to find anything for $52,000 anymore.  It's impossible.  I'm actually willing to spend some money.  You're going a little higher?  So I was woken up at 3.30 in the morning and I really did think about you.  I'm like, fucking Anthony's in a brand new place right now and I'm dealing with this shit.  I was sleeping on my new mattress, which for some reason, mattress companies, you're out of control. 
[01:01:00]  Stop already.  They're high enough.  They have reached a height where now they are just stupid.  I have a mattress.  I was standing on the side of the bed the other day watching TV, looking at the bed going,  I could climb up there because I've got to take a shower in like 10 minutes, but I was watching something  and I wanted to kind of like sit down or lay down or something and looked at the bed and went,  it's just too much work to climb up there.  The thing is four feet off the ground.  What, do you have a mattress on top of your bunny? 
[01:01:30]  It's, he's on to something though.  Maybe before I bought this house, you could have said that.  My mattress is up to my belly button.  Dude, yeah.  And I'm not a, that's where it is.  I'm not really a short guy.  That's where it is.  It's giant.  You know why?  To justify the stupid prices.  The price.  Exactly.  They pumped it up.  That's the only reason.  Yeah.  I took all these classes in college.  That's the only reason.  To justify how much did you pay for your mattress.  A lot.  And guess what?  Stop already. 
[01:02:00]  They're the same fucking thing.  Yep.  This one helps you sleep better than this.  No, they're the same fucking mattress.  I got a big thick thing with a pillow top.  And then here's the problem.  The box spring that comes underneath, I found out you could get a low profile box spring.  Because with all the mattress, you got like fucking 20 inches of mattress.  It doesn't matter what the box spring is.  It's not like the old days where you got this little pad sitting on a box of springs.  You could throw that.  And that was your support.  You could throw that mattress right on the floor. 
[01:02:30]  On the floor.  It would be the exact same sleep.  No different than if it had a box spring on there.  So now I got to get a low profile box spring so it fits in the bed frame.  Someone in the mattress business, you call up and explain why the mattresses are so big now.  Get the secrets.  We want all the secrets.  How much control do you need?  You have to have like the difference.  You know, if you do this on this side, you won't feel it on that side.  You know what else takes care of that?  A good old fashioned fist.  A fist.  I'm trying to sleep.  And if you move, your teeth are winding up on those pillow.  On those pillow. 
[01:03:00]  Because I'm kind of fine.  On those pillow.  On those pillow.  On those pillow.  So yeah, I was moved in.  And well, at three in the morning, Opie, when you had rats or whatever roaming around your house.  It's definitely mice.  Maybe you think the rats are fighting with the mice?  Is that a possibility?  Is that a war going on these days?  I don't know.  Mouse, rat, war?  I don't think so.  Yes, they say it's going to be a civil war as soon as the U.S. troops pull out.  But that's just so wrong.  Yeah, I've got to get some peace between them. 
[01:03:30]  All right, go ahead.  But I was sleeping soundly.  And I am so...  This is my first house with an alarm system.  I am enjoying having an alarm.  You know me.  I'm always...  I'm very up on security.  But in rental houses for the past few years, for my whole life, never had an alarm system.  Never really needed one.  There was one in my rental house.  But put it this way.  It was one of those with the silver tape around the windows everywhere.  And it had this switch that looked like it was from NASA 1968 at the base of one of the sliding glass doors. 
[01:04:00]  And then this big orange, because it had discolored plastic button that you were supposed to push for something, is ancient.  So I never hooked it up or never used it.  This one, all nice and modern.  And I could lock myself in now.  And I set the alarm so the motion detectors are shut off so I could walk around the house and everything.  And I'm sure a bunch of people got this.  This is just what everyone else has in the world.  I haven't, though. 
[01:04:30]  Wait, you can't walk around your house if this thing's on, though?  If the motion detector's on.  What a pain in the ass.  You've got to bypass the motion detectors and then just have it set for the doors and windows.  And when he means lock himself in, he means lock himself in his bedroom.  Well, that's when I sleep.  I lock in the bedroom.  Of course.  And then the motion detectors can go on.  And then you're locked in your bedroom.  If the alarm goes off, you know you have an intruder.  The shotgun comes out.  I'm firing blindly through doors at that point because I know everyone that's important to me, me and my girlfriend, that's it, are in the room. 
[01:05:00]  Anyone outside the room is the enemy and must be destroyed.  Do you find it easier to keep the biohazard suit inside the room with you?  Yes.  I have a biohazard suit walk-in closet that just has different ones for every day.  It's a wonderful feeling, security.  And, you know, not like I need it because remember my old neighborhood of Great Neck, which I like to now call the slum, the slum that I used to live in. 
[01:05:30]  Because there were a lot of Jews living there.  And I love living amongst the Jewish people because it's a nice, secure area.  You know that there's wealth in that area.  You know that the property value will go up when there are Jews living in your neighborhood.  And there's no real crime going on.  And you like to keep your enemies close.  I wasn't going to say that.  Who knew the serial killer was living right next to the police station? 
[01:06:00]  Who would have thought that?  You know, I did make a joke with my girlfriend about how, I go, how long would it take?  And I actually had this scenario in my head.  I go, how long would it take, honestly, seriously think this, for the police to arrive from the second I unfurl a 10-foot Nazi flag from my balcony in the front of the house?  I go, how long would it take?  The second it goes over the garage doors. 
[01:06:30]  Like, I would hit a stopwatch and go, all right.  I said, like, six minutes the cops would be there.  In six minutes.  And I might try it one day, but I've got to, you know, fit in with the neighbors first so I can play it off as a joke.  Sure, like when you're going to the bank to get some diamonds with your briefcase, you have to make sure that it's safe.  This is why it's Angel!  This man needs a doctor!  It's my old neighborhood of Great Neck.  Had a lot of Jewish people living around me. 
[01:07:00]  But I noticed very close, and there were other people of other ethnic backgrounds.  I wasn't too hip on that.  A lot of Indians, which are fine.  They're professional people.  A lot of doctors are Indians and stuff like that, which is fine.  But sometimes, at night, if they're wearing hoods, very hard to distinguish Indian people from certain criminal elements.  Very hard.  Is this on?  Are we on the air yet?  I was just saying. 
[01:07:30]  But where I live now, it's just Jews galore.  It's actually called, it's a small hamlet called Jewville.  And it's full of Jews.  That's all I live near.  They have a community watch.  You know the community watch in most neighborhoods?  Sure.  There's a sign that says, this neighborhood has community watch.  And you look at it and go, yeah, sure, it does.  What are you going to do?  You know, someone's going to see something called.  They're all nosy bodies.  It's just a sign that's supposed to scare people.  My neighborhood has this extra special community watch thing that they do that they have a disclaimer on the bottom that says, this has nothing to do with the town of North Hempstead or anything like that. 
[01:08:00]  And it's a community watch where the residents have cameras on their houses pointing in various directions.  And they monitor them.  And their night vision and some of them infrared.  And they're all over the place.  You don't know where they are or who has them.  I love it.  I saw that sign.  I almost jacked off to it. 
[01:08:30]  I love it.  When I'm hitting my codes on the alarm.  I'm watching lights blink.  I got floodlights.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  You know there's no cameras, right?  No.  There are cameras.  It's all in the mind.  There are cameras.  There's no cameras.  There's signs that say, I'll take a picture of the sign.  You do that.  I'll take a picture of the sign.  Mr. Goldberg with his stupid Polaroid.  I'll show you the sign.  I'll take a picture.  And you know it's Jewish because watch is spelled with a V. 
[01:09:00]  He says he doesn't know where the cameras are.  You can't see them.  Of course you can't see them, Anthony.  They're there.  And I'm going to help because I'm putting cameras up.  I'll help.  Of course you are.  I'm going to help.  Maybe they should have had a sign that says, this neighborhood is protected by security conscious ghosts.  They're all over the place.  They keep a watch on me.  Don't they, hon?  They can't be seen.  Yet they help.  They help.  I know there's cameras.  There has to be.  I heard there's an invisible shield. 
[01:09:30]  The criminals can't see.  The force field over the entire neighborhood.  When he touches it, a blue little pulse light comes off of it.  And he goes, ow, and runs away in fear.  And how funny is it that they saw this swarthy Italian move in and they're all putting their homes up for sale.  They're petrified.  I made a point because as I pull into the neighborhood, now picture, if you will, a very nice, upper class, suburban neighborhood.  The streets, freshly paved. 
[01:10:00]  Thank you.  The sidewalks are groomed and edged.  The street lamps are, they look like oldie time gas lamps.  But, of course, they're electric because it is the future.  And it's just wonderful.  Down the street, look, it's a family outside.  A dad is playing basketball with his young son.  And then over here on the side, look, there's a mom and her daughter.  And the daughter's riding a bike alongside the mom. 
[01:10:30]  Maybe they're going to the corner market to do a little shopping.  Ooh.  Anthony?  I hear birds.  Wait.  Anthony?  Yeah.  You realize you've never, you haven't moved yet.  Stop playing Sims.  No, this is my neighborhood now.  It's wonderful.  You're playing Sims, aren't you?  No, it's beautiful.  You're still in your old place, aren't you?  Every car in every driveway is a Mercedes or a Lexus. 
[01:11:00]  It's wonderful.  Caddies, they're beautiful.  And so I come pulling up with my first load in the back of my truck.  So I back into the driveway.  And, of course, the neighbors, they all want to know who their new neighbor is.  And I just brought over some stuff that I didn't want the moving people to touch.  So the first thing I bring out are my radio control helicopters, which gets a lot of attention because they're very big.  And I bring them into the garage. 
[01:11:30]  And you strategically did this.  Yes, because I know the looky-loos would be like, what is, wow, that's nice.  You know, because kids to grown adults look at those and love them.  They're amazing.  And, of course, now they've got to stand around and go, I wonder what he's going to take out of this.  But they don't stand around.  They're still playing basketball in their driveway or bicycling.  Or the woman, one of the women across the street was kind of just out in the front yard because we moved Saturday.  And Saturday was a beautiful day here in New York.  Perfect day for moving in this beautiful suburban neighborhood. 
[01:12:00]  And the second load I took out, Opie, was my AR-15, my shotgun, and my duffel bag of ammunition.  That came out.  And I slowly walked from the back of my truck in the driveway.  Didn't go through the garage, which was readily accessible right there to hide anything.  I went to the front door and slowly walked, not looking or making eye contact with any of the neighbors.  Of course not, because that would be bad.  But slowly walked in. 
[01:12:30]  Because I want everyone to know where I stand immediately.  Yeah, that girl and her mother may come over and break in and put cookies in your bedroom.  What do you think is going to happen with these people?  Get off at 145th Street with your address and show the garden and go, this is where I live, criminals.  I just want everyone to know what's going on in that house.  Right, mental illness.  Of course.  The next few years, it's going to be a lot of fun to do this radio show with you, man. 
[01:13:00]  Because it's happening in front of our eyes.  As you throw a sink through the window and escape.  Escape from his own house.  I want to show them the model of the Devil's Tower I made in my living room.  It's wonderful.  Look, guys, it's a helicopter.  Okay, and they'll go over to look at it, they'll see like little Nazi insignias on the side,  and it even drops things on people, does it?  I could fly this anywhere, over any of your houses.  Let's say hi to Tom on Long Island.  Tom, what's up? 
[01:13:30]  Tom, you're, yeah, this is Tom.  Tom, sorry about that.  Anthony, your neighbors are already selling you out where you're living.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it wasn't five minutes.  I was in a bar.  We were hanging out up, actually not too far from where you are.  Oh, you moved in over here.  The contractor's next door.  You're having a house done next door, right?  Somebody's building something next door to you.  Wow, you're very good, sir.  Yeah, and then.  All right, all right.  Don't give too much detail.  Yeah, not too much information, my friend.  I don't want to have to shoot somebody.  How about, are they shooting a movie in your neighborhood?  They were shooting a movie, yeah.  What was it? 
[01:14:00]  Anything good?  I don't know.  I went down the road to check it out, but I didn't kind of, I didn't stop.  Looks like the Sopranos, the way you are.  Speaking with them.  You asshole.  They got your house on TV right now.  Hey, wait a minute.  What is that?  It kind of looked like my neighborhood.  What the hell are they doing?  All right, Tom.  All right, Tom.  Stop by for a beer, my friend.  Okay.  Okay, he will.  He'll be shot.  But, wow, that guy actually, they're bragging down the block at the bar, at the corner bar.  I don't even know where that bar is. 
[01:14:30]  Why don't you live in a gated community?  I don't like gated communities, because all the houses are the same, and I like the neighborhood thing.  I like the super, Jimmy, do you know what it's like to walk down, picture a summer's day.  You're walking down that sidewalk.  You smell, oh, there's flowers.  The smell of lilac and honeysuckle is in the air.  And you look down the road.  There's children roller skating. 
[01:15:00]  They're all white.  And, uh...  Wait a minute.  What, yes?  I'm just trying to...  Let me just enjoy this description of heaven.  The train comes by.  Willoughby.  Next stop's Willoughby.  It's like a Twilight Zone episode.  It's so wonderful.  Whether summer, winter, wintertime.  Uh...  No, there won't be Christmas, will there? 
[01:15:30]  Hanukkah.  Menorah's in every window.  And a big Christmas tree in mine.  Except for your dirty tree.  My awful Christian tree.  Christian tree.  Oh, I set the lawn up with a whole nativity scene.  Filthy New Testament tree.  Those Jews are gonna know a Catholic lives there.  A God-fearing Catholic.  I hold no grudge that you killed my Savior, people.  Neighbors, I hold no grudge that you are responsible for the death of my Lord and Savior. 
[01:16:00]  Please say that to every door you walk up to and introduce yourself as a new neighbor with cookies.  Really, just have one.  I hold no grudge over the whole Christ thing.  Cookies baked in the shape of a cross.  I love it.  You won't know the joy of a suburban neighborhood until you live there and can soak it all in every sense.  Every single sense is touched.  Let's go to Joe in New Jersey.  Joe?  How you doing, guys?  Hi, Joe.  Anthony, are you meeting with Ed Harris in the shed in the backyard about the cameras? 
[01:16:30]  I like that.  All right.  Do you have a shed?  No shed.  No shed.  I'm gonna be putting a pool in, so I may have a cabana.  But no shed.  Dan just laughed at me.  We're all laughing at you, Anthony.  No.  Oh, let's go to Ralph.  Hey, Ralph.  Hey, guys.  Hi, Ralph.  How are you?  Hi.  Congratulations, Anthony, on the new house. 
[01:17:00]  Thank you.  Just heard about the security system, but I came out of the military, and that's kind of what I got into.  Just for personal security on the upper end.  Can you hook me up with trip wires, sir?  Because I might need a few of those around the perimeter.  Do you know there's actually sensors you can have installed on the floorboard set at your weight?  Let's say you're a 180-pound guy.  Right.  Somebody comes in 200, it goes off.  And, I mean, you can have trips all the way through the house. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-huh.  And it's one of those maybe a little bit over the top.  Do you think?  One bad meal and the cops show up?  Tim, I love you.  You make me laugh.  I work in, I work, going to work, love when you're on the show.  It's nice to know the crooks could just send in a child as me.  That's funny.  He's 65 pounds.  It must be Anthony.  What happened?  I don't know.  He was raped by five Filipino criminals.  What happened?  Robert Reed robbed him. 
[01:18:00]  We're checking the DNA on this broth bowl, and some rope fibers were found.  I had it set for three pounds.  How did he get it through?  Five of the guys I've worked with in the past have become criminals.  I mean, the people that install the systems, it's very, very easy to know how to bypass the systems and get in that way.  The guy is very reputable.  Very reputable. 
[01:18:30]  All right.  Yeah, I know.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you, Ralph.  Let's go to Pappy in New Jersey.  Pappy.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hi, Pappy.  I'm glad, Anthony, you get this beautiful neighborhood to look at in the five seconds it takes to drive into your garage and shut this door and not come out for the next day.  Yes.  Yeah, no kidding.  Just a matter of time before Anthony does the show in pajamas from the house.  I have this vision that from Friday at 1130 to Monday morning, you just wear pajamas. 
[01:19:00]  Wow.  You just walk around in pajamas.  You're pretty accurate there.  The weekends are really spent online, which is driving me crazy because a lot of boxes in the house and stuff, we just moved.  All I have is a laptop hooked up, and I can't really do anything too extreme on a laptop, so I'm going kind of nuts.  No real gaming.  I could hit the internet, but that's about it.  Got to unpack, which will take a year. 
[01:19:30]  I still have boxes, dude.  I still have boxes, like stuff I haven't hung on my wall yet that's still like from February to April.  Throw them out.  No, no, it's me and celebrity pictures.  Like I said, throw them out.  That's not happening.  Garbage.  No.  When I move, I throw everything out.  What, both items?  Start anew.  Both items.  Both items.  You're a minimalist.  You don't have that much.  It's a couple of keepsakes and some photos, and you're finished.  Because a little known fact about me, since 18 to now, I didn't really have roots.  So I was always moving, so it was a pain in the ass to have too much shit. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  I left a lot of stuff behind, and Danny took it.  And every time I move, I just pile it up in front of my house, and that's it.  And then I start anew.  I let Danny take all my old stuff that I had.  He came over the house on Sunday with Ziggy and two vans.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding?  What did Danny get from you?  A hernia?  Yeah, a hernia.  Holy shit.  I thought Danny had a little bit of muscle to him.  I know.  Oh, my God.  What made you think you could pick up Anthony's checkbook?  Thank God Ziggy was with him. 
[01:20:30]  There were two vans.  Danny, you got Anthony's leftovers?  I absolutely did.  Yeah.  And I am so grateful for it.  What did you walk away with?  No problem, my friend.  A bunch of stuff, man.  Coffee table, end table.  He got the glass and iron coffee table.  Glass top was everything.  Anthony's describing this table like we've seen it.  Well, no.  I mean, none of us have seen it.  I know.  You ever see, like, a coffee table?  He just described that, like, you know, the coffee table when you were over and you were,  you know, putting down your soft drink on.  There was a glass top coffee table and two glass top end tables. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Those are the ones that I was petrified any time a kid was over, that they're running,  like, full speed ahead into the corner of a piece of glass.  So, glass stuff, anyway, I've had.  All I picture is drunken Danny falling face first through it.  Danny Holden.  Yeah, Danny Holden.  And that will absolutely happen sooner or later.  And Danny will probably make good use of the wine rack that he also got, which also has  some glass and iron. 
[01:21:30]  They all kind of matched.  It was a matching set.  Wine rack you had?  Why?  For wine, Jimmy.  He's a fancy man.  He's not.  Anthony's not gentlemanly.  It was for aesthetics, really.  Do you have a wine cellar in this place?  No.  I have a wine cooler, though, in the kitchen.  Oh.  You open it up, and it's refrigerated, and it cools your wine.  It's wonderful.  Oh.  It's fabulous.  And Danny took the wine rack, the dining room set, which was just a glass top dining 
[01:22:00]  room set and four chairs.  Stools that also went in the kitchen area.  You got his junk.  What was the best thing you hauled away, Danny?  The desk.  Probably that desk, man.  That was fucking fantastic.  My mission control is what this was.  It was a huge wooden desk.  Why'd you get rid of it?  A huge wooden desk, because I need a new one for the new office.  I'm not bringing the old one.  Yeah.  Who moves?  I mean, what are you talking about?  It's just throw it out and buy new stuff.  You get new stuff.  No.  The new office, first of all, is I have a design idea for it, and the desk didn't fit.  It's like a early 1900s adventurer-type office. 
[01:22:30]  That's what I want it to look like.  Darkwood mahogany paneling, sort of burlap wallpaper, and then like an oldie-style globe,  and an office, very darkly lit, very heavy, velvety curtains, and pictures from like the  1908, and like a biplane, and adventures in Egypt, and things like that.  That's what I want for my office.  I want it to look like that.  Isn't that cool?  Like an old adventure with a rug on the floor with a big compass on it. 
[01:23:00]  That's my office.  Photoshop's big in.  I'm really, I'm not kidding either.  We know that.  That's the office I want.  I haven't seen anything this exciting.  But, but it's kind of modernized because on the wood paneling, you ever been in like  an oldie-style library kind of thing with the wood mahogany thing?  And then on one wall, inlaid in it will be a flat-screen television to keep it, you know,  modern and up to date.  But the whole thing is going to look like an old 1915-style adventurer's room. 
[01:23:30]  Pith helmet, spear, and a shield.  Yeah, things like that that I brought back when I was in Africa.  Deepest, darkest Africa.  I got, this is an actual Negro foot.  You know, things like that.  It's still in his sneaker.  You know, I'm very psyched about the office.  Oh my God.  Let's say hi to John in Indiana.  John, what's up?  Yeah, man.  I think Kev gets it.  You love the idea.  I do. 
[01:24:00]  You do.  Of course he does.  Because he's as crazy as I am.  John, go ahead.  Yeah, or if you go get a couple German shepherds to protect your estate.  Oh, you're a silly, silly man.  That means he has to care for something.  Exactly.  Are you insane?  How am I supposed to dart off somewhere if I have to make plans?  He's going to get just the barking sound.  Those, those, those.  Right.  Arr, arr, arr.  Arr, arr, arr.  Yeah, that's all.  Chris in Massachusetts.  Tigger the dog.  Remember Tigger the dog?  Oh, Digger the dog. 
[01:24:30]  Digger.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  A digginy goes with you when you explore.  Just pull his leash, but don't say his name too loud because someone might misinterpret  it and knock your teeth out.  Chris in Massachusetts.  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  How you doing?  Hello, Chris.  Hey, uh, Anthony.  It sounds like you moved in the town of Stepford.  It is just as wonderful as Stepford.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  What's wrong?  In Wisconsin.  Mike, what do you want to do for, uh, the program today?  Hey, I want to start a new bit called, uh, make a hole in my wall with my AR-15. 
[01:25:00]  What?  Come on now.  Where are you?  Wisconsin?  Wisconsin.  And why would you want to just shoot into your wall right now?  Because I, I, well, I've done it before by accident.  Yeah, by accident.  You know, fuck it.  What type of neighborhood do you live in, sir?  Oh, I, I live off the street.  So, you know, it's like away from, you know, normal people.  What's through, what's behind the wall for a good mile beyond your wall?  Behind my wall, which I'm going to fire my AR-15, is a chair, which I don't really care about a whole lot. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, what's behind the chair?  I'm talking, the thing goes after it goes through the wall.  Oh, okay.  Do you have a brick house?  I'm on Pal Talk right now.  If you, like, it's Mikey, uh, 587 right now.  And you can see it right there.  And I'll, I want to start a new bit called, put a hole in my wall.  Holy crap.  He's, uh, yeah, he's on Pal Talk with his, uh, friend.  Hey, shoot your cat. 
[01:26:00]  No, I'm not going to shoot my cat.  Come on, shoot your cat.  Look, there he is.  What does your shirt say?  I don't want to do that.  Come on.  What's your shirt say?  Are you up for it?  Come on.  All right, dude, dude, let me, let me, let me tell you something.  If, if you do this, I want you to shoot down so it goes no further than one foot outside your house.  No, no, seriously, I, I would totally do that.  I'm a responsible.  No, you're not.  What does your shirt say?  Come on.  Does he even hear me?  It says we. 
[01:26:30]  What does your shirt say, Mikey?  It says, want to make out?  Want to make out.  Oh, okay, no.  Come on.  Shoot it through your floor.  All right, here we go.  Shoot it through your floor.  He's live on Pal Talk.  Does anyone live downstairs?  No.  You're alone in the house?  I'm alone, yeah.  All right, shoot it through the floor.  Go ahead, let me see what this is, you maniac.  Wait a minute.  He's got an AR-15.  Here we go.  Okay.  You're on Pal Talk.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:27:00]  Cat was flying.  He shot it through the floor.  What a maniac.  Dude, you're an animal.  I said wait, wait, wait, because you had to move the webcam.  We don't know what you shot at.  You shot through the floor.  I understand that.  Move the webcam so we can see the damage.  All right, here we go.  Let's see the bullet hole.  You fucking sick bastard.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Man, the camera's got to adjust.  Right there.  There it is.  Oh, there it is.  You shot your chair?  Okay, well.  Oh, it's through the wall.  Yeah, I see through the wall. 
[01:27:30]  I'm sure that's where it went.  You are a maniac.  Come on, man.  Fucking, yeah.  Dude, the AR-15, man, it's the bomb.  Right here.  Right here.  That certainly is wonderful.  I think so.  This is the shit right here.  Maybe so.  And Neil is God.  All right.  All right, my friend.  Don't kill anybody.  Do you want him to do it again?  No, once is good enough.  Believe me.  I don't know where this guy lives.  This guy could have a house right next door to him.  Some old lady could be right now bleeding. 
[01:28:00]  He looks like Chet from Weird Science.  Yeah, he does.  Drunk and cleaning.  You spitting this?  I have this thing on an open ante fan site.  Shoot your dishwasher.  No.  Little Venezuelan woman.  Yeah, that's what I meant.  Well, that was pretty crazy.  All right.  That was on Pal Talk.  We all checked that out.  All right, Mike.  Thanks, Joel.  Thank you.  All right.  Later, you maniac. 
[01:28:30]  I'm turning his camera off.  Jesus.  Fucking lunatic.  I have to tingle.  Yeah, congratulations, Anthony.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I am very, very jealous.  You are invited over anytime you want.  Thank you, Anthony.  Yes, any of you.  Thank you.  Come over tonight at 1130.  Cordially invited, Jimmy.  I'll be there.  Yeah, we'll come over soon.  Yes.  I just can't find a place.  Yeah.  I'm a suburb guy.  I don't want to live in New York City.  You've got to go to the burbs.  But I don't want to deal with that commute. 
[01:29:00]  It's not bad.  And, you know, we do have...  It's not.  I left 10 minutes earlier this morning because I'm a few exits out from where I was.  Right.  And I got here 10 minutes early.  I don't know how that worked.  I've been looking at places in New York City in my price range.  I'm just amazed what you don't get for your money.  Opie, let me tell you what you get for your money.  Yeah, a little bit on Long Island.  Green trees, rustling of leaves in the morning.  Children playing, but not near your house. 
[01:29:30]  Not annoying you.  The sounds of nature.  And neighbors.  Pale neighbors.  It's a wonderful, wonderful experience out there.  You get your own chunk of land.  A place to call your own, Opie.  Not a room on top of someone else's room and another room on top of yours.  It's your palace.  Your kingdom.  That's what you need.  You're going to make me cry.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  All right.  We'll take a break.  When is...  Oh, we've got to take a break.  Bill Ward's calling in any minute now.  Supposedly, yeah.  Black Sabbath being...  I don't know.  What is it called?  Inducted.  Inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Who cares?  No offense.  Even my favorite bands, I don't give a shit when they're inducted.  Who cares?  It means nothing, that stupid Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Every single band you hear on the radio will be in there eventually.  Yeah.  How special is that?  It was special at the beginning. 
[01:30:30]  If you made it onto the radio, you'll be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame someday.  That's just how it works.  Once that time constraint is up.  What is it?  20 years you've got to be in the biz?  It's kind of like if you make it into Major League Baseball, you'll be in the Hall of Fame.  Really?  Yes!  Does that happen?  Huh?  That happens?  No, of course not.  That's why this Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is so ridiculous.  It's a joke.  It really is a joke.  And yes, the rumors are true.  From O&A Pictures comes a story of three friends.  We're assholes who all share a common secret. 
[01:31:00]  We have a problem with women.  We hate women and we butt sex each other.  Hi, I'm Father Frank and I'm a cocksucker.  Living in a world that doesn't understand.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  We stink.  Bye-bye.  Join them as they travel to a remote Wyoming mountain to experience trust, friendship,  and love.  I love spooning nude with another man.  And the most fabulous disco music, this side of the Rockies.  Break out the rubber gloves. 
[01:31:30]  Pound, pound, pound, pound, pound, pound.  I'm just going to keep pushing, pushing, pushing.  We pounded for two hours.  We just pounded each other's ass.  Brokeback Disco.  What do you guys say?  We show a little bit of a program unity and I'll go to the men's room together.  Jimmy's taking a dump.  I got to pee.  There's only one toilet.  Open up your legs, Jimmy.  That's right.  Putting the home in homo.  Can I suck your cock?  You grab the shaft.  Make sure you get a handful of hair and yank up and down.  Coming soon.  The one guy's laying back.  The one guy's blowing them.  Hold on tight.  We're going to be wet.  To a bathhouse near you. 
[01:32:00]  Strap it on and stick it square up your ass with a Frederica bimble.  Jesus, Opie has a body on him.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Jimmy's here.  What, no Ramon? 
[01:32:30]  I thought you left the room to call up Steve from Yellowstone.  Yeah, why not?  Well, let's get right to it.  We got to say hi to Bill Ward from Black Sabbath.  Bill, how are you today?  Good morning, Jim.  Doing okay, thank you.  Hi, man.  It's good to hear from you.  I don't know if you remember me.  I interviewed you back over the summer.  No, I remember.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was cool.  It's my low self-esteem.  I didn't think you would remember me.  Of course.  Okay, yeah. 
[01:33:00]  Well, first, congratulations.  Unforgettable little creep that Jimmy is.  Yeah.  I kind of creeped him out, but he was a gentleman.  Congratulations on the induction, man.  Bravo.  Well, cheers, yeah.  Yeah, thanks.  How do you feel about it?  Like, is it kind of, do you feel bittersweet or are you thrilled about it?  Are you like, it's about time?  I'm bittersweet behind it, yeah.  You know, I mean, I'm glad that it's happening, but I can't, I don't know.  I kind of think that there's some kind of, you know, we found out that we were getting 
[01:33:30]  inducted like one week after we got back from the UK Hall of Fame, you know, so I don't  know.  I don't know.  You know, I just, it's just me, you know, I guess it's the way that I am, you know.  What made you feel better, UK Hall of Fame or this one?  Well, the UK Hall of Fame kind of came as a major surprise, but it was really nice.  I mean, it was just a really good experience, you know, as I'm sure tonight will be as well. 
[01:34:00]  I mean, I don't want to, you know, blag off the Hall of Fame, but it just seems ironic  that we just now got inducted, you know, right, we just literally got the word, I think, we  did the Hall of Fame in England, November the 15th, I think it was, and like literally about  a week or two, a week and a half, two weeks later, the Hall of Fame in the US let us know  that we were going to be inducted this year.  But we're alongside another band, is it Leonard Skinner? 
[01:34:30]  Yep.  That I believe we've both been nominated the same amount of times.  So, you know, in that sense, it's, I guess it's, it's, I don't know, I sometimes somehow  think that Black Sabbath thoughts have gone in a little earlier than it has, you know.  Absolutely.  How many times have you been nominated?  I think it's nine times or eight times, I'm not sure.  Eight or nine times.  Did you, was there any, was there any thoughts from you guys of not showing up to it?  Was there, was there, was there one party that said, look, you know, that we, I'm not even 
[01:35:00]  showing up for this crap?  No, I think everybody's been, you know, at least this time around, since we found out  we've been inducted, everybody's been, as far as I know, everybody's been okay, you know,  wanting to, you know, come and do it.  And, you know, with everybody's own personal views of it, of course, you know.  But, yeah, I mean, in one sense, you know, it's like, it's great, you know, it's very  nice, you know. 
[01:35:30]  For me, I just wish it could have, you know, happened maybe a little earlier.  But, you know what, it's happening now, so, you know, I'm, you know, in that sense, I'm  still, I'm still glad that, you know, at least we're going to get into, you know, the Hall  of Fame, I guess, and whatever that, whatever goes with that, you know, so.  Yeah, you know, it's a, it's a resume stuffer, you know, for your next, you go, you go, hey,  look, I'm in the Hall of Fame. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, yeah, you know, so, it's like, okay.  What, does the band, because you got Metallica, is going to be the band that kind of brings  you in.  Yeah.  Does, does, do you guys pick who does that, or is that the, the Hall of Fame?  No, that was, that was, that was the Hall of Fame that designed that, yeah.  Do you have any kind of relationship with Metallica at all?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, shit, yeah, we've known them for years, you know.  Yeah, that seems like a band you guys should know.  We know, we know Metallica, you know, I think probably before they made the first  record. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, when they were little kids.  Yeah, when they were little kids.  Snot knows little bastards, right?  Are they, are they playing, or are you guys playing, or both?  I just want to understand that Metallica are playing, but Sabbath, I don't believe, are  going to be playing, so, at least that's what I know this morning.  You know what songs they're going to be doing?  Yeah, I said Larger's doing, they're going to do Sabbath songs.  Yeah, but I.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, hopefully.  What are the odds of James doing It's Alright?  Oh, I don't know, probably, like, nine million to one or something, I would think. 
[01:37:00]  You know what they're playing, or no?  No, I don't know, uh-uh.  No, no idea.  I'm really happy for you guys, as much as I kind of hate the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,  because I've been screaming about them for years, how they seem to induct, you know,  what's kind of mainstream popular, but, I mean, you guys have influenced more bands  than anybody.  There's not one band who's in heavy metal or any type of metal that would not count you  guys as a major influence.  Well, I can appreciate that comment, yeah, I, you know, that statement, you know, 
[01:37:30]  that's why sometimes it's kind of like a bit, you know, it's like, hang on, guys,  we, you know, we were kind of at the beginning with all this, you know, it's like, um, you  know, maybe, you know, like I say, maybe it would have been nice to have gone in earlier,  maybe on the second or the third nomination, but, uh, so it, I don't know, it tells me  that there's some kind of corporate kind of messing around at some level, you know,  that's gone on in all this.  Well, you guys have always been like a dark horse as far as, like, the critics and stuff 
[01:38:00]  like that.  I mean, what, do you think it's because of where you came from, your point of view, or the  critics never seem to, like, love you guys as great as you were?  Um, well, that's true, uh, I, I mean, I, I don't know why, you know, they just, I, I  have no idea why, you know, I probably had the clue a few years ago, but these days, you  know, it's like, no, I, you know, I don't, I don't really care, you know?  Yeah, he just passed a point and goes, fuck it.  And more, yeah, literally, but more so, you know, um, I think these days it's like, uh, 
[01:38:30]  you know, we seem together that we have been given a lot of credit.  You know, especially in the last, uh, 15, 10 or 15 years.  But I put a lot of that down to, um, you know, a lot of the, uh, bands, you know, uh, that  have, uh, you know, that have become extremely popular in, in hard rock or in metal or hardcore  metal or, you know, and they, um, and they, you know, basically it talks about Black Sabbath 
[01:39:00]  as their influences.  Um, so those, those bands have helped to revive or, or, or almost, um, make sure that  the, um, you know, they would, you know, that the, uh, the, that the beginning of all this  is, you know, right from the early 1968 has been, uh, you know, kind of put in its, in  its, uh, right shape, if you like, uh, in our, in our history, you know, in the history  of, uh, uh, metal.  The overwhelming evidence, it seems by, by the bands, you mean, like, cause most of 
[01:39:30]  these critics are dopes.  They wear these, they like wear the, a suit jacket with, uh, the shirt button to the very  top button, but no tie and the thick glasses.  And they're more like, you know, in excess fans.  They don't seem like they're more Sabbath fans.  And maybe the overwhelming evidence from, uh, from bands finally woke them up a little  bit.  Well, you know, I think so.  I think everybody's kind of, you know, um, again, I put it down to the bands and I think  a lot more journalists these days are, uh, give us a lot more credibility.  I think, I think, I guess history or hindsight is, uh, it's kind of gone, you know what, 
[01:40:00]  this isn't going to go away.  So, so, you know, it does, it gets a lot more credibility there than, than, uh, it certainly  used to do.  Yeah.  I think, I think a lot of people, uh, thought of themselves as too cool for the room to really  dig you guys, you know, a lot of the writers and, uh, that probably helped.  Yeah.  Well, that was, I mean, that would, that would happen too, you know, and, you know, and it's  true to say as well.  You know, sometimes maybe, uh, we might've felt like we were too cool for the room as  well, you know, uh, to put it around the other way. 
[01:40:30]  Although we, I think, uh, our band's pretty down to earth, to be honest with you.  I mean, you know, we, we pretty much, you know, on, on the, on the ground floor, so to  speak, you know, you know, cause it's so, that, that, that kind of thing, that kind  of attitude or, or way of life, if you like, shows up in our music.  Like, it's very much, you know, it's like, it's just real, it's raw, you know.  Bill, you do a radio show too, man.  Where, where, where do you do your show out of?  Where can people hear your show?  Um, we're out of, uh, you know what? 
[01:41:00]  I don't even know the numbers.  You can find out the information on, uh, billward.com.  Um, but we, we go out of Cerritos College and, uh, um, you know, we do, uh, every, uh, kind  of like every third Saturday, uh, for two hours and I'm starting a new show.  Um, I'm doing a classic rock as well, classic rock show, as well as all my hardcore stuff,  you know, cause, uh, it's basically just hardcore with, you know, Shadows Fall, Mnemic, 
[01:41:30]  uh, Lama Guard, you know, all the guys in Flames, uh, Soil Work, um, Slipknot, you know,  I mean, I love all those bands.  So we, we play them each month.  Um, and speaking of Shadows Fall, by the way, the drummer Jason, I, I kind of know, and I  saw him recently and he was just raving about you.  Oh, Jason's fantastic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jason Bittner.  He's, he's, he's, he's fantastic.  You know, and, uh, but talking of, uh, hardcore bands, did you hear the new In Flames album? 
[01:42:00]  Did you hear that yet?  I listen to nothing but Sabbath.  You don't understand.  If it's, if it's not you guys, I don't acknowledge it existed.  The only other band I'll listen to is cover albums.  The guys that do Sabbath tributes, that I'll enjoy.  And, uh, Jimmy's such a huge fan, Bill, that he's, uh, very, very sad today.  He's not going to tell you, so I will tell you.  He, uh, really, really wanted to be there today and, uh, all his connections kind of dried  up. 
[01:42:30]  He had a lot of people going.  He had a lot of people going, yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll take care of you.  I'll do this.  I'll do this.  I'll, I'll, I'll make it happen.  And now it's finally here.  He's been looking forward to this day for years and, uh, and he's not going.  Yeah.  And he's got to sit and, uh, not be there.  Poor little bastard.  We're working, we're working on, I, I, I'm a comic.  I have the same agent as Metallica and, and, and Blondie and they're going, wow, we don't  know.  It's like, it's just, when you're not the big breadwinner, nobody gives a shit.  Huh.  Huh.  No, I'm sorry to hear that. 
[01:43:00]  I'm sorry.  See, Mary.  I know.  At least, at least Bill's honest.  Like, hey, well, tough for you.  Bill, Bill, he's not very big.  Can he just sit on your lap for the ceremony?  We can do that.  Yeah.  We can do that.  Can I, I don't, I don't mind, you know.  Yeah.  I'll just put on a little Waldorf Astoria outfit and fetch you guys beverages.  I don't have to get paid.  I'll just be like a little house boy.  You guys have a greatest hit CD coming out too, um, I guess.  Do you know what's on that?  Who's that?  You guys have a, don't you guys have a greatest hit CD or was I misinformed? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Right.  But you're asking the wrong guy because I'm usually the last to know about shit like that.  Oh, okay.  I, um, you know, I, uh, I have no idea.  He knows when a check comes in.  It's like, oh, okay.  I endorse it here.  I thought we'd done that one years ago.  The greatest hits one, you know, I, so I don't know.  I know that this keeps regurgicating, regurgicating.  I can't even say it.  Forget about that.  But I was thinking for that word. 
[01:44:00]  But you know what?  Yeah.  I, I don't know.  I, yeah.  Yeah.  You've stumped me.  You've, you've put me into cold air.  Are you going to be in, uh, be in New York for a little while?  Or are you going, going back immediately?  I've got to go back.  I've got to go back in the morning, uh, back home to LA and then, you know, it's a really  busy week.  So I'd like to be, you know, I'd like you to be cause I'm doing comedy shows.  So I'd love you to come to one, but it would probably be too nerve wracking and just bomb  in front of you anyway.  How embarrassing would that be?  Oh, one of my heroes is eat my balls.  Do you, uh, do you work at that, uh, Gotham club? 
[01:44:30]  Is it the Gotham club or?  No, I, that's funny.  That's the one comedy club I won't work at in New York.  Oh, really?  I was doing a Leno.  No, I had, I had a set on Leno and I was warming up for it and all the clubs were very,  very, um, good about letting me go on because it was a five minute set.  And, uh, the one that would, that gave me a hard time was Gotham.  So the comedy cellar in the village is the best club in the city.  Hmm.  Okay.  And Jimmy, uh, holds a grudge like, uh, the Jewish defense league.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  I really, I really don't forget easily.  No, he doesn't.  Why, why did you ask about that one?  Had you gone there?  No, but I've heard about it.  And I just wondered, he just kind of, he just popped up on the radar, you know?  Yeah.  Comedy cellar in the village is the best one.  If you want to go, it's, it's on McDougal street in the village.  Um, why not really?  Jimmy, you'll get you a seat there.  My friend.  You certainly will.  And chicken wings, whatever else you like.  I have nothing to offer, Bill Ward.  I just want to give you something because you've given me so many years of happiness.  I can give you some wings and as many Diet Cokes as you like and free admission to see my mediocrity. 
[01:45:30]  I have nothing to give this man.  I'll go with the Diet Coke, yeah.  All right.  Well, Bill, I'm, I'm, I'm so happy for you guys.  Um, I really, I mean, even though to me the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is whatever it is,  is just to see you guys getting some recognition that you, that you deserve, man.  I mean, I, I really, really love you.  Well, thank you.  I think that's, that's really, that's really, really nice.  Especially first thing on a Monday morning. 
[01:46:00]  It sounds, sounds real nice.  Congratulations, man.  Thank you.  No, it's appreciated, you know?  You know, I think once it, once it's over and done with, it will kind of sink in in maybe  a month or two, you know?  It's, uh, it's not something that's kind of like instantaneous, you know?  I think it will be believable when, um, maybe in a month or two, it'll just be like,  oh, wow, we did get inducted, you know, finally.  What it means for me, you know, is like, it's not necessarily about me personally, but 
[01:46:30]  what it means is, um, for me is that, uh, it's like, uh, it's like reinstating or, or,  or helping to continue to open up a, up, up a given opening into the Hall of Fame.  And hopefully for other metal bands that are coming in, you know, there's a lot of  metal bands that deserve to be in the Hall of Fame.  Oh, this is going to open the door for other bands.  That's pretty obvious.  So, you know, I'm, I'm hoping that, that, you know, this will help, you know, even though  I know that, uh, ACDC went in there and, you know, already, you know, you know, we know 
[01:47:00]  them guys too, and, you know, but, but, you know, the, um, which I thought was great,  you know, it's like, okay, you know, fair, fair dues.  But, uh, yeah, I, I'm, I'm, that's kind of where I'm at with it, you know, just for  the sake of metal music or, you know, the, the, the, the attitude of metal music or hard  rock, you know, and there's a lot of good hard rock bands in there as well.  So, so it's just a continuance, continuance of, of, uh, music history, you know, that's 
[01:47:30]  kind of where I'm coming from with this, but, uh, go ahead.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  No, it's okay.  I, I, I've been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland.  I was just wondering what the band is going to give the actual Hall of Fame.  Cause don't they ask you guys for something?  Um, you mean in the way of possessions?  Yeah.  Memorabilia, things like that.  Whether it's something you wore in concert or, you know, they always try to figure something  out.  Well, you know, for me, I, I gave them the top of the flight case that's been around for  about 30 years. 
[01:48:00]  Wow.  And what's, what's written on there is, uh, well, that was one of the items, the several  items, but that was one of the items was a top of a, one of my drum cases that had ripped,  that had fallen apart.  And it just says, Bill Ward, Black Sabbath, Aston, Birmingham, which is exactly, you know,  where we came from.  Jimmy, uh, is getting hard, Bill.  Oh, he would love to have that on.  I just, any Sabbath history, you don't understand, it just makes, it just pleases me.  It just really pleases me.  It pleases me that you guys are still doing gigs together, man. 
[01:48:30]  I mean, I've been a fan for so many years, and then I'm, what, 99, you start headlining  OzFest again, so I finally got a chance to see you.  And, uh, it's amazing how these guys, after 30-something years, you can still follow anybody.  There's nobody that goes on before you that, that, uh, gives you guys a problem after.  It's unbelievable.  Bill, can you walk, uh, could you walk around your house and just, uh, find something you  can mail to Jimmy?  It would really make his day.  It doesn't have to be anything special.  Socks?  Anything?  A plate you're finished with?  I'll find something for you.  Maybe a shirt that you haven't worn in so long, it's at the back of your drawers or something. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, some awful liquor shirt that some dumb company, we get sent those swag all the time  we never use.  But make sure it has a sweat stain or something, you know, so it looks legit.  You're gonna make me sound creepy.  I'm not that creepy.  There's not that much sweat stain.  Well, the funny thing is, Bill, if you really sent just some piece of garbage from your  house, Jimmy would, you know, cherish it for the rest of his life.  Dude, I'm not weird about that.  If you have any trash, I'd frame it.  That's all I'm saying.  Okay, I'll tell the wife.  I'll tell the wife to send you up there, the new trash.  Now, you know what? 
[01:49:30]  No, I'll send you something.  I will.  I'll do that.  I'll have Lisa send something up to you.  Bill, Bill Ward dot com.  When is your next radio show people can check out?  Is there a way for them to check that out on the web?  March 25th.  March 25th, it's a hardcore show all the way through.  And you guys do have a Greatest Hits CD coming out.  Our producer just informed me.  It comes out tomorrow.  It's Black Sabbath's Greatest Hits.  I wish I knew what's on it.  From 70 to 78.  So, obviously, before the, you know, just the old stuff.  Well, it's going to be, you know, Black Sabbath, NIB, Wizard, War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man, Sweet Leaf. 
[01:50:00]  I think Children of the Graves is going to be on there.  And one of my favorite songs, Changes, Snow Blind, you know.  Probably close to the same one that was released last time.  But you know what?  Buy it anyway.  Because I know I'll go out and grab it just to do it.  Because probably the label wants to capitalize on the induction and the press around it.  And they should.  Hole in the Sky.  Nice.  Nice choice there.  Really?  Nice.  Yeah, Dirty Woman.  Never Say Die.  Rock and Roll Doctor.  Hey, if there's one song you guys could play live that you don't play live anymore, what would it be? 
[01:50:30]  If there was one song we could play live.  That you haven't done live in many, many years.  It would be Symptom of the Universe.  God damn it, yes.  They did a little tease to that when you guys, I saw you guys.  God damn it, yes.  If you don't understand, that's exactly the choice I would have made.  I really fucking love Bill.  He makes me really happy.  All right, Bill, we're going to let you go.  Thank you so much for calling in today, man.  I know it's a big day for you.  And you just don't know how happy you made me end the show by calling in, man.  And please come in next time you're in New York.  All right. 
[01:51:00]  Thank you, Jim.  You know, I'll see you around.  I'll have Lisa send you something nice, okay?  Thanks, man.  We really love you.  All right.  We love you, too.  Take care, Bill.  Bill Ward, everyone.  Thanks, Bill.  There he goes.  Oh, that guy's a legend.  He's the greatest guy, man.  Rock and roll legend.  The nicest, most unassuming guy.  All right.  Very good, Jim.  You did a good job there.  Yes.  And you still don't have a ticket.  I tried.  No, I know.  I tried.  Oh, my God.  How uncomfortable was it when he goes, and Jimmy doesn't have a ticket?  And he goes, oh, well.  Oh, okay.  Like, that spoke volumes.  He might as well have said, well, don't expect me to do shit. 
[01:51:30]  But that's what Bill Ward should say.  He's one of the four.  But when your agency kind of says that to you, that's where it kind of hurts your feelings  a little bit.  It doesn't hurt when a guy who really doesn't know you.  You're on the phone with the guy who's going to be right there.  But you know.  And where's your seat?  He might have an extra ticket in his back pocket and go, oh, you know, blah, blah.  You ever have extra tickets?  Yeah.  You ever have extra tickets?  And you go into a sold-out event or something that we were doing or anything, and people  are like, oh, can I get in?  And you're like, no, there's no tickets. 
[01:52:00]  No, no.  I can't do anything.  Do you understand, though, that Bill didn't know there was a greatest hit CD coming out  tomorrow?  Yes.  These guys just show up.  They just show up.  They're past that point.  Oh, my God.  Since 1980, he's been doing that.  Yeah, where they have to deal with people like you.  Just shows up.  He shouldn't have.  I should actually ask him for a ticket in person, and he should spit and get some on  me and keep walking, and that would be fair.  Then try to clone him through his spit DNA.  And make a little bill to hang out with and chat with. 
[01:52:30]  What a sweet guy, man.  A lot of people commenting that there was some ass-kicking, uh, kissing going on.  Some ass-kissing.  Oh, really?  Gee, you think?  Just a little bit.  Yeah, I'm biased.  Yes.  He could have talked about anything, and it would have made me happy.  Yes.  And it did.  And he's a nice guy.  He's not a pompous ass like a lot of the modern-day musicians with their fucking  social messages.  He's just humble and happy.  And why didn't you tell him that, uh, they're telling us you have to go?  Oh, just because he was talking for, like, we had him on for, like, 20 minutes.  You have special rules for your heroes. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  I absolutely do.  All of a sudden he goes, well, we'll let you go.  I think that was the perfect time to have him on.  Yeah, man.  He just wanted to say hello.  I was happy he called.  And he actually stayed on longer than I thought he would.  And, uh, I was glad he called in.  Oh, this is smart.  Let's go back to Mike in Wisconsin.  Mike.  Hey, man.  I got water leaking in the basement.  What happened?  I think I hit something with my AR, man.  See, you shot around through the floor, which was safe because you didn't shoot it through 
[01:53:30]  the wall, but you hit a pipe?  I think so.  I went down there, and then I just, there's water all over the floor, and then I just came  back up and was looking at you guys, man, because you guys, you're the shit.  Why don't you turn your main off, sir, and find where the water's leaking from?  I rent.  I don't care.  Holy shit.  You're shooting a gun off in a rental?  Oh, yeah.  Guy's great.  I don't do that.  What a lunatic. 
[01:54:00]  So it looks like you hit a pipe, huh?  Yeah, and I hit my big screen, too.  No way.  Yeah, seriously.  I'm going to, like, try it.  No, my thing won't freaking reach over.  Do you see the hole?  Oh, go ahead.  Do you see the hole in your big screen?  No, it's, uh, I think it's because it's a full metal jacket.  Yeah.  Like, expanded and everything, and just went all over the damn place.  Yeah, a little piece might have, uh...  Now, can you put on some boxer shorts and bring that gun into the bathroom and then collapse 
[01:54:30]  against the toilet?  Not today, man.  I love you, Jimmy.  I love you, mister.  He does look like the older brother of weird science, man.  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  A nice, greasy pork sandwich.  There's, like, water.  My whole face in it is leaking.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, get some pictures of that and send it in.  We'll throw it up on the website.  All right, man.  Good luck to you.  All right, thanks.  Thanks, Bill.  I love you.  Let's go to Joe in Jersey.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, the best way to sum up what Sabbath's all about, during the Dehumanizer Tour, the 
[01:55:00]  beginning of the friggin' concert, there's no effects, there's no nothing, just Tony  Iommi walks out on stage, his guitar's on a chair, he picks it up, and he just starts  playing mob rules.  It just shows what Sabbath's all about.  No bullshit, no effects, just fuckin' the music.  Well, Dehumanizer was what?  That was with Dio, I think, right?  Like, 95?  No, 92.  I think I'm the only...  Me and you are the only Dio friggin' Sabbath fans on the planet.  Oh, dude, I love Dio.  He's the only other Sabbath... 
[01:55:30]  Obviously, he said that when he was in the studio.  He said the only other Sabbath was with Dio, and Ronnie James, Dio is fuckin'...  Amazing.  I hope he shows up today, I don't think he will.  Yeah, except the midget wanted, like, money from, uh, Ozzy Song, didn't he?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know what happened, that little fella.  I remember once, and I wanted to kiss him.  He's Elfman.  I know.  Hey, man, peace out, guys.  We know the NYPD, they might be able to get you in there today, Jimmy.  Um, very possible, but I mean, they won't have badges and stuff.  I wouldn't be surprised that some of our guys are, uh, not, uh, you know, doing security  for the whole thing. 
[01:56:00]  You're probably right, but those guys may have a certain, uh, protocol.  They have to follow, where they may not, you may need badges and stuff, and, and, and  laminates to walk around, and without a police uniform, unless they'll give me one, like  Rocco had in The Godfather, if I could have a...  Jimmy's like a little kid today.  We gotta get this done somehow.  We have to get this done.  I would love to get that done.  And to the guy who said I was a spoiled brat, like, I, I understand that thing.  I am grateful that I have gotten to meet these guys, I have gotten to interview them, which  is all thanks to this show. 
[01:56:30]  And I am forever grateful for that.  Yes.  But when you have an event like this, where the whole band's gonna be there, it's very  rare that this entire group of men is in one area.  It just doesn't happen.  That's why it's important.  Jimmy, with all due respect, it's a little creepy, though.  Why?  Because we all have our favorite bands, but you're, the obsession, I wanna get...  Yours is like a 12-year-old boy.  I wanna get in, I wanna get into it someday.  I mean, I got, I got rock heroes, without a doubt, but there's something about Black Sabbath  in you.  Like, did they get you through, like, tough times, or...  Like, it goes further than most, most, uh, most fans. 
[01:57:00]  I'm very, I'm just one of those guys, I'm just a loyal, which, it works against me because  I'm anal about new things, but I'm fiercely loyal to things that I love, and that's it.  And I mean, I'm that way with Kiss, I'm that way with this show, I'm way with them, I'm  just, things I love, I never stop loving.  But when I get into arguments, like, Nirvana's one of my biggies, right?  And someone's like, ah, Nirvana stinks, and whatever.  You know, I'll argue with them a little bit, but it, it doesn't affect me on, on a level  like it does you when someone tells you, like, Sabbath sucks, or Ozzy's overrated, or...  Like, personal, like, you're insulting his dad. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, he will, like, pretty much kill for Sabbath.  But you met, don't forget, Nirvana's a band you discovered in adulthood.  Had I discovered Sabbath, I probably would still go, wow, they kick ass.  But, I mean, I liked them since, what, my 37s, since I was probably, since the early 80s.  But I was a fanatic Who fan, when I was, like, a kid and growing up and stuff like that.  Who wasn't?  Except for Jimmy, you know.  We get it.  Who, who, who, who, who.  We get it.  But I was a fanatic.  See, but that doesn't piss me off, it's like, alright, whatever.  But as I grew...  You missed the boat on the Who, what can I tell you? 
[01:58:00]  As I grew up, that kind of went, you know, to the wayside.  Other bands took their place.  Sure.  And there was a point, though, when I was, like, I don't know, maybe 13 or 14, that the  Who was huge to me.  And, you know, the Who's friggin' denim jacket with the Who on it and the whole thing.  And if anyone said the Who sucked, you get in a fight with them and shit like that.  That's great for a young teen.  But, Jimmy.  Well, you know what it is, too?  Like, certain bands, I think the thing with, at least for myself, that Sabbath connects with, 
[01:58:30]  is there's such a personality thing with Ozzy as the front man.  There's such a fucking connection as a front man.  Whereas the Who, Daldry, I mean, look, Ferris there was great.  Daldry was a huge front man.  And so was a plant.  But there's just something gritty and raw and you connect with about Ozzy.  Or at least that's what most connections with.  There was something really raw about Sabbath that you just didn't find with other bands.  I don't know.  I haven't found...  Raw, I'll give you that.  There are Zeppelin fanatics that love them as much as I love Sabbath, sure.  Did you support Ozzy through his poofy hair days? 
[01:59:00]  When he looked like Bette Midler, when Ozzy wore those awful long sequined things and  had his toenails painted black and released doves and did a shot in the dark video, I  went, God damn it, I still want to hold you.  Really?  Of course.  I knew it was.  Now more than ever.  In hindsight, it's bad.  But it hurt a little bit, didn't it?  No, I'll tell you why.  Because I've been a U2 fan.  That's my band.  I mean, I never stopped loving U2.  And when they put out, what was the album?  The pop album, which was like that whole disco-y album. 
[01:59:30]  It was tough to admit that I was a U2 fan still.  But we got through it and now they're rocking again.  At the time that Ozzy did that, it wasn't bad.  It wasn't as bad.  Because it fit into the moment.  And he was surviving.  Like a lot of bands, don't forget, died and never made it through.  Ozzy has survived from 68 and on Sabbath all the way through now.  And you've got to change a little bit.  What was going on there was the whole hairband phenomenon.  So he decided, all right, I'll poof up the hair a little bit.  I'm not going to wear the fucking makeup.  Hire some young guns to play with him.  Yeah, like they were wearing the makeup. 
[02:00:00]  They were all looking like girls.  He maybe would throw a little bit on to highlight his eyes.  Just a little bit.  Just to make them darker and more alluring.  And it worked.  But when your favorite band goes through those stages, you're like, oh.  Sure.  Oh, what is it?  Yikes.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  And Sabbath went through them.  And look, there were times where Tony Iommi, it was called Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi.  He was the only thing that kept the band going.  Ozzy was doing his thing.  Bill and Geezer were gone.  So, I mean, there was times where Sabbath did not feel like Sabbath, obviously.  I was a big Rush fan for a while.  And when they did that whole rap tune, I'm like, oh. 
[02:00:30]  What rap tune?  God damn.  That was awful.  What rap tune?  I don't remember that.  Everyone felt there was a portion of the 80s where everyone felt they had to put a rap part in their song.  Roll the bones, right?  Roll the bones.  Where's the rap part?  Yeah, it's in the middle of the song.  Oh, it's so awful.  I don't talk about Rush much, but I've seen Rush easily 10 to 12 times.  Really?  Huge Rush fan.  And I even saw Rush during those days, and they actually played that live, and I was just like, douche chills. 
[02:01:00]  Douche chills.  Stop with the fucking rapping.  What are you doing?  You're a band that has massive albums and hits out there.  You didn't have to go down this road.  You don't have to do this.  You didn't have to go.  You want to go see Rush?  I'll talk to my agency.  Listen.  I don't care anymore, to be honest with you.  This is Rush, believe it or not. 
[02:01:30]  Who's sick?  I don't even know who does the rap in this.  I don't think that's Geddy Lee.  Of course it's not.  It's awful.  Is it, uh, what's his name?  What?  Is that Neil Peart?  That was Neil Peart?  Neil?  Really?  Whew.  That's bad.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  Well, you looked ridiculous.  That's the same band that did Limelight. 
[02:02:00]  I mean, come on.  What are you doing?  And Red Barkata.  That was awful.  Good song, though.  People felt they had to put a rap part in the song.  It happens to the best of the bands, though, man, you know?  All right.  Speaking of music, have you guys checked out the new channel on XM, Big Tracks?  I've had Big Tracks on my preset right over Top Tracks.  What's Big Tracks?  And I've been sampling it through the weekend. 
[02:02:30]  Big Tracks is classic rock for our generation.  I don't know.  I can't understand what the difference is.  I like some of the songs that they're playing on it.  It's basically music that came out in the 80s.  But what's the difference between Big Tracks and Top Tracks?  Top Tracks is everything.  All-encompassing.  All-encompassing of what?  Really big rock songs.  Big Tracks is just, like, from the 80s on.  Yeah, but our generation.  So Top Tracks is...  It's like classic rock for our generation. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah, but Top Tracks plays 70s, 80s, and 90s.  Honestly, it's still a little goofy.  And Big Tracks plays 80s and 90s?  And then you got Deep Tracks.  And then there's the 80s and 90s channel.  But the 90s channel rarely plays cool 90s music.  It's usually, like, in vogue and shit.  I'm not a big fan of the decade channels at all.  No, I love them.  Except the 90s one.  Nope.  I don't mind the 80s one.  There's too much shit going on.  Too many music forums going on.  They've gotten better.  They've gotten better.  I'll argue for them.  They've gotten a lot better.  60s, 70s, 80s, I like a lot. 
[02:03:30]  Like, the 70s channel, I love.  Yeah.  I just don't...  The 90s has got too much weird club stuff.  The 90s is too much...  Yeah, yeah.  A lot of dancey shit.  I don't connect to anything in the 90s.  Oh, you don't mind the 70s channel with all the disco mixed in with the really great rock  music that came out in that era?  It's fun sometimes.  In that era?  It's fun sometimes.  Yeah.  I don't need all good 70s rock music.  Right.  Sometimes a good goof tune in there is fun.  If I want to hear Muskrat Love, it's on there.  Faggot.  Holy cow. 
[02:04:00]  Now, sometimes a little nostalgia is fun.  Well...  Caddy Jimmy loves the Decades channels, and I have them actually programmed.  I have the 60s one programmed in, so I can right up to the 90s and see what I like.  That's what I do.  I got...  One of my whole presets are just top tracks, big tracks, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me ask you a question.  Yes.  Why would you have all four wasting four things when you could just put it on 60s and then...  Because Caddy Jimmy likes on the steering wheel, I can just go click, click, click, click, 
[02:04:30]  and forward.  So you hit 60s, that covers all four.  Yeah, but Caddy Anthony has the buttons on my nav right there.  So does Caddy Jimmy, but he doesn't like to reach over.  Oh, I can do it for the steering wheel.  I reach over, though.  But not...  Only for one.  See, here's the thing.  When I'm zipping around town in the Caddy, I like to have...  I don't know what...  I don't know what you go...  You don't deserve a Caddy.  I'm Caddy Jimmy.  That's my name.  You don't deserve it.  That's my name.  You don't deserve it.  That's my name.  Hey, Caddy Jimmy's here.  I can't help it.  It's my name.  Caddy Jimmy.  Caddy Jimmy.  Can't help it. 
[02:05:00]  But it's...  Is that the new character, Caddy Jimmy?  No, it's just who I am.  It's C-A-T-T-Y, because I gossip a lot.  Right.  You're Caddy.  How do the ladies, gentlemen, like it?  Hi, Big Daddy.  New car.  Hi, Caddy Daddy.  Caddy Daddy.  He's a Caddy Daddy.  Hi, Big Dick Caddy Daddy.  No, I don't want them in there getting their stupid sneaker heels all over my windshield.  Hey, do me a favor.  Right now, go to Deep Tracks.  I want to see what song they play.  Ah, shit. 
[02:05:30]  Deep Tracks.  It's time to just get rid of Deep Tracks.  Who's listening?  Deep Tracks?  Let's all be honest with each other.  I don't listen to Deep Tracks.  I was in rock music for many, many years, and I'm like, what?  Jethro Tull's playing a spoon for 20 minutes?  Who cares?  Do you want to hear that?  On my other presets, though, I got like Squiz and Lucy.  You got Chill?  Ethel.  I don't have Chill on there.  By the way, if John Zellner's listening, or Eric Logan is listening, Chill, Channel 84,  a great station. 
[02:06:00]  It's all the rage.  You need just a taste of hits on there.  A taste of hits.  Some familiar songs peppered into what you're doing over there.  Was it all like DJ stuff?  Mixed stuff?  It's just, you're just chilling, you know?  You're on your computer, you're chilling, and it's the music in the background.  Very kind of hip and modern and not too spacey.  With a little bit of a beat at times.  Nothing too crazy, though.  Nothing too crazy.  I think Van has your answer.  Deep Tracks is playing deep album cuts.  Yeah, but what song? 
[02:06:30]  What song is it?  You have to go to...  Van!  Oh, it's up there.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  No, when I do it, it just pops up on this whole thing.  Van Morrison's doing Cleaning Windows.  Actually, that's not him.  It's actually him Cleaning Windows, because that's what they do on Deep Tracks.  What song is this?  I have Van Morrison singing a really cool song when you can listen to him clean windows.  Oh, my God.  That's a perfect example.  Holy shit.  I've been a DJ since I was...  Well, if you count the years in my room by myself trying to escape from my miserable childhood, 
[02:07:00]  it's about 12 years old, okay?  Coming up...  I've never heard of Cleaning Windows before.  Coming up, Eric Clapton vacuums.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Coming up next on Deep Tracks.  And I want to...  What is this?  The smell of the bakery from across the street  Got in my nose  Yeah  This is beyond deep  Yeah, we carried our letters down the street 
[02:07:30]  With the Rhode Island Kate Rose  Wow  This channel should be called Who Cares Tracks?  Wait, they also have Danny Kaye sings in the shower  Boring  Boring  You know something?  Someone might enjoy this  Boring  But here's the problem  And this is where you're right  You have to love a band so much  No one loves every band  So the odds of a Van Morrison fan clicking on and hearing this  Is minute  No one wants to hear deep tracks from a band that you don't care about 
[02:08:00]  But that's what this satellite thing's all about  Look at the variety you get  There's plenty of channels, for God's sake  Someone might enjoy that  And then the next song, someone else might enjoy that  Right  Anthony, I've had XM for about three years  I had it way before we even signed with XM  Okay  I haven't enjoyed it once  Not ever  I go there all the fucking time  Not always about you  Perhaps there's a gentleman out there grooving to that song 
[02:08:30]  They had Led Zeppelin the other day  I wouldn't be able to flick past it quick enough  They had Led Zeppelin the other day?  Yeah  Ironing  Ironing  That I want to hear  Yes  That I want to hear  The whole band  That's right  You know what though?  I'd rather it be somewhere like that  On satellite  Here on XM  Than I was listening to that fucking Q104  The classic rock station here in New York City  They're good  Because all I had was a regular radio in my bathroom at the old place  So I'm showering  And it's goddamn  And the colored girls go 
[02:09:00]  For 8,000 fucking times  Billion times that I've heard this song  And then  He's a brilliant entertainer  No he's not  Lou Reed  Lou Reed sucks ass  Ass  And then  Is there a new Lou Reed album out?  Anyone?  Because  Let me tell you something  They played a Lou Reed song  That I had never heard  And  It was  The biggest piece of shit 
[02:09:30]  It went on  Opie  Forever  And then there was a part that came up  Where he's talking  Which he does  He doesn't sing  And then there's this  Long  Droning  Musical thing  I  I got out  Of the shower  I'm dripping a nude  Mind you  And I yelled  I yelled  I  Yes Jimmy  I said that for you  Just water dripping off his hairy ball bed  That Italian body  Just glistening  Oh lord  All 85 pounds of it  Yes  Shimmering 
[02:10:00]  And still  My hands are wet  Covered in my own semen  My hands are wet  And I grabbed the radio  And I actually went  Enough  I yelled  To myself  Nude  In the shower  As I turned it off  And then he looked and realized  That it was unplugged  The whole time  Right  And it was just what he heard  In his head  The song was called  The blacks are coming  Doot  Do do do do do  The blacks are coming  Doot  Do do do do do  He wasn't even in the shower  He was in his backyard  It was raining  Yes that's why he was dripping wet  Had to get out to his shed 
[02:10:30]  Standing nude  For a secret meeting  Yes  He talks to the shadows  His own shadows  That sound like a great way of life  Lou what  What are you doing in my backyard  Is this  Yeah  Okay  What is this  Oh yeah  Music from  Beautiful Mind  Very good  Yes I hear this in my head  Let's go to Peter in Massachusetts  Peter  Hey guys what's up  Hey Peter  Listen uh  Big Tracks is for fact 
[02:11:00]  They just played uh  Journey faithfully  And then now they're playing  Brian Adams  I mean come on  What's wrong with Brian Adams dude  You ever hear uh Heaven  Yeah I like to listen to Brian Adams  When I'm fingering my asshole  I mean come on  So what  That's a priest  That must be so smelly  Yes  What better time to listen to him  Rock out the deep tracks  Big Tracks is for fact  The only uh  Brian Adams song  Worth listening to is  Heaven  I love that song  Cuts like a knife  Summer of 69  I've heard it a thousand times  I can't take the songs  I've heard a thousand times 
[02:11:30]  Here's Summer of 69  I was one who gives a shit  I've got my first real six string  Bought it at the five and then  Heard it till my ears bled  Shut the fuck  Enough with this song  How many times do we have to hear it  Alright listen  What'd you do with Parker  And one of the guys quit to get married  Right 
[02:12:00]  That was a good decision  I could relate to this man  That was a great decision on that guy's part  What did you do with Parker Posey  I fucked her and we 69  Lucky bastard  Oh what were they  What were they  The best days of my life  Oh yes they were  Oh yeah  Give the goose you are  Oh I got them  Me too  They're on my balls  And there's red marks around them  Cause when that song's playing 
[02:12:30]  Then you remember the best days of your life  Oh no I don't  Of years gone by  She looked up and said  Hi daddy  I have no respect for the Springsteen of Canada  I like this song  I love it  The Springsteen of Canada  Yeah  I got a list of  Wait wait Opie  What  What are they  Yeah man  I like this song  Let's sing it together 
[02:13:00]  No  Please  The days when I had no responsibility  Yeah man  Wow  Alright enough  No not enough  They were young and restless man  How old is that asshole  He was playing guitar in 69  I think 90  He just changed it to summer of 79  You goose  Sucking on my mama's dick  You get more pussy  If you change it to summer of 79 
[02:13:30]  Of course  Anyway  So Big Tracks is the new channel on XM  It's XM 49  We got a sample of  I guess this was two hours  Ah  Two hours worth of music  Yes  Phil Collins  I don't care anymore  Okay  Alright  Just giving you a feel for what this channel's doing  Better than that god damn other one  What  In the air tonight  In the air tonight  Enough  You know when I liked that song  When it was the opening for Miami Vice 
[02:14:00]  That was it  When they used it as the commercial promo  Huh  For Miami Vice  Before it came on the air  What Ben  It's the name of the song that's in the air tonight  Of course it is Ben  That's what we said  That's what he said  I didn't hear  I was in the studio  Why don't you just correct him  No Phil Collins  I didn't hear you say it  It was better than that song he sang about being Jewish  Sue Sue Sue Sue  Sue Sue  Sue Sue  Sue Sue Sue  Sue Sue was  Awful  Horrendous  And his remake of  If you can't hurry love  His fat Charlie Brown face 
[02:14:30]  Would have been slapped on a cock for that  Take me home  There was no jacket required  That was the name of the record  Ah  There you go  A little trivia for you  I was a huge Genesis fan  As soon as he went solo  Ugh  I can't get a comb through Ben's hair tonight  Do you have a rake?  It's alright  Alright listen  So  Want to hear the songs they play on big tracks there?  Yeah man  So it's Phil Collins  I don't care anymore  Yeah  Tom Cochran  Life is a highway 
[02:15:00]  Life is a highway  Now who isn't driving to life is a highway?  It's called the good driving song  Right  They used to do good driving song weekends  Yeah  That one  On rock radio  That Sausalito song  The whole weekend of driving songs man  Man  We're just driving  Or songs about the road  Right  Did that too  Driving down Pacific Coast Highway man  But that was part of the workforce blocks  Three songs about driving 
[02:15:30]  Yeah  Ugh  Ugh  Good stuff  What's a good drive  Is there any songs around driving that are good?  Life is a highway  That's why I hate you  That song  Life is a highway  Come on  Jimmy Norton  It's a feel good song  Come on  Caddy Jimmy  You're in the caddy  I would rather be  Hit Walt Paralyzed Jimmy  This fucking song  Is ragefully bad  Why?

Wait for the hook man  Wait for the hook  Yeah  It's all about the hook  Then everybody sing  Yeah  Everybody  I wait  I won't ride it 
[02:16:30]  All night long  Come on Jimmy  Sing  Sing Jimmy  Die on the heart away  This song eats my ass  And it's three minutes too long  By the way  This just in  Tom Cochran  Going into  Going to the induction ceremonies today  Is he?  Yep  Lucky him  Figures  Tom Cochran  Jimmy made a little mistake  With Parker Posey apparently  Why? 
[02:17:00]  I heard that she was dating  Brian Adams  All right  Jared from Cleveland  Hey I just wanted to correct  Little Jimmy  Parker Posey never fucked  Brian Adams  She fucked Ryan Adams  Ryan Adams  Isn't that that limey?  Sorry about that  No no no no  He's American  He's from like the Carolinas  Do you know  Here's how I found out  They were dating  That's my fault completely  Obviously  Because it seemed like an odd  I was in a record store  With Colin Quinn  A DVD store recently  Maybe it was six months ago  And Colin just doesn't shut up  When you're out with him  He just yaps  He makes everyone uncomfortable 
[02:17:30]  And the guy behind the thing  Was saying yeah  Parker Posey was in here  With Brian  I guess he said  Ryan Adams  Ryan Adams  Think Brian  All this time  I was thinking that he was  Banging her  I thought that was a little odd  And America's not smart enough  Here's a guy  Ryan Adams  He's got what it takes  Finally to be a big hit in music  And he assumes that  People aren't going to make the mistake  Between him and Brian Adams  Oh Brian Adams  Change your fucking name  Change your name  Yeah I agree  Do you know what David Bowie's name was?  Uh uh uh uh uh uh  Wait I do know that  Uh shit 
[02:18:00]  Uh um uh  David Jones  David Jones  Right  But he changed it to David Bowie  Because he knew  You can't be Davy Jones  There's only one Davy Jones  Right?  Yes  Uh let's go to Anthony  My showbiz name is going to be  Petey Pendergrass  Girl  No  Look what you've done to me  Nothing  Me  And my whole world  You got a name ready  Can you please car crash me  On Pete Pendergrass  Alright  Okay 
[02:18:30]  But you got a name ready  How fitting  You got an entertainment  Entertaining  An entertainment  Name  Norton Norton  Norton right  No Caddy Jim  Caddy Jim  Caddy Jim is my  Is my fucking weekend hang name  I don't do that  That's not my showbiz name  Caddy Jim is when I put  My little  My um  My golfing tango on  I have the windows down  Oh I could picture it  And I got my left wrist  Over the wheel  What part  The wooden part  Of the steering wheel  The wooden leather  See how my part  I put my wrist on  Is the wooden part  For a little bit of grip  When I turn  My right hand is doing 
[02:19:00]  This in my passenger  And she's going  Oh Caddy Jim  That's great  Anthony on Long Island  Hey what's going on  What's I  That's me too  Quick question  Alright  If you listen to  The Boneyard  What bands  Do they friggin play  Cause I haven't heard  Of one of these bands  Maybe one or two  Dude I gotta disagree  I love  No  I love the Boneyard  I'm with this guy 
[02:19:30]  One of my guilty pleasures  Is the stupid hairband era  Cause that's when  I was really starting  To make it in the radio world  I played all that shit  On the radio  Okay  I tune in  What's it called again  Boneyard  Oh yeah Boneyard  I tune in that station  And it's another one  I get frustrated by  On XM  So frustrated  I just want to hear  One hit every once in a while  Hold on  Oh let me answer  You question  We work here  What  We work here  Dude hold on  I love Boneyard  I really do  See we work for XM 
[02:20:00]  I know that  I know  I know who we work for  Wait dude hold on  They had  Listen listen  Yesterday they had  Motorhead  It was like  Fucking you never  They go too deep  That's the best  Part of the platform  But you don't need  To go deep  If regular radio  Is not playing  In these genres  To begin with  That's my whole argument  That I've had  With XM  Since I started here  They can play  Why do you have  A hairband type channel  And you play  More obscure shit  Than hits  Play hits  And get deep at times  That would be perfect 
[02:20:30]  But they can afford  To have two channels  Dedicated to that  What are you talking about  Like have some kind of  Deep shit like that  That a few people  Will enjoy  And then have  The hits  If they had  If the Boneyard played  Nothing but hits  I'd be so happy  But I understand  That would be a little  Too crazy  But somewhere in the middle  Is where you want to be  Stop with the  Being too cool  For the room shit  How hard  Would it be  Just to add  Another fucking channel  Well bandwidth  Things  They can't just  Add channels  It does take 
[02:21:00]  A lot  Goes into it  I am not  A fan of  Let's be too cool  For the room shit  I'm not  When satellite  First started  The first people  Getting the satellite  Radio was  Because they were  Too cool for the room  And they wanted  Some obscure shit  But now it's  Becoming a little  More mainstream  So you have to  Adjust accordingly  I'm not saying  Turn into commercial radio  Where it's a whole  Bunch of hits  But a nice balance  Hits with some  Deep tracks from the  Bands you like  That's why  When I hear  Like Bay City Rollers  I want to hear  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y  Night 
[02:21:30]  I don't want to hear  Some of the  Deeper cuts  From the Bay City Rollers  You don't want to hear  Tuesday  Right  Right  I do  Which they  Did I guess  I am amazed  You knew another song  Absolutely  You scared me there  That was my point  I loved Woody  He was my favorite  Bay City Roller  Really Woody  Dude that went  Right over your head  That was a brilliant joke  And I'm going to  Acknowledge it  Okay go ahead  Because they did  S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y  Right  So their follow up hit  Was Tuesday  And I had no clue  If that wasn't  One of their songs  I honestly didn't either  I thought it was 
[02:22:00]  That's how  That's how awful  They are  And I know it's a  Hacky joke  I'm crashing you  And me  And Jimmy  Because he's in his caddy  And he's paying attention  To the girl next to him  No caddy Jimmy  Doesn't hit things  Caddy Jimmy just  Hits the brakes  And glides around  Glides to a stop  Alright here we go  Big tracks  XM49  So we're trying  I'm just trying to  Give you a sample here  But we stop after every song  So we got Phil Collins  I don't care anymore  These are some of the songs  They're playing over there  Tom Cochran  Life is a Highway 
[02:22:30]  Meatloaf  Paradise by the Dashboard Lights  Dire Straits  Industrial Disease  Ozzy Osbourne  Flying High Again  Not only a fine performer  A good song  That you never hear  On commercial radio  And it's not so obscure  That you wouldn't hear it  That was a hit for him  As far as  Ozzy hits  I love Flying High Again  Great tune  You know I heard  From Dire Straits  On big tracks  That I like  Remember that song  Roller Girl  Oh wow  That one  That's a good  Dire Straits song 
[02:23:00]  Brings you right back  To the time  Man  I like the other one  I want my MTV  Nah that one's overplayed  See that's the one  They play all the time  Money for nothing right  That's the one  They play all the time  You never hear Roller Girl  Don Felder  Heavy Metal  Remember that song  Yep  How'd that go  I don't remember that  Does anybody have a copy  I don't know it either  You're setting me up  No I'm not  Derek can sing it  Through his machine  He sings it  Through his singing machine  It's so wonderful  Derek sing us a little  Of that song 
[02:23:30]  Through your  Singing machine  Remember this  I don't  No  Wrong  Sounds like a yes song  Now you remember  This rock  Come on man  Did you like this  I really did like this  When it came out  I don't remember it  It wasn't that bad at all  Also on the list  Whitesnake  Here I go  Again  Whitesnake  The cars  You're all I've got tonight  Elvis Costello  Pump It Up  Jackson Brown 
[02:24:00]  Lawyers in Love  Alright  Some songs gotta really be bad  Bad Lawyers in Love song  How does that one go  Yeah  No don't play it  This list is like a mutual fund  This is a hedge fund  You know  You're gonna get your ups and downs  But this all evens it out  In the end  You don't lose money  Or make money  Is Lawyers in Love bad  Oh Lawyers in Love  I know I've heard it  Jackson Brown is awful  This is Lawyers in Love  I like the yodeling part myself  But it's later in the song  This is heavy  I like the punching solo 
[02:24:30]  In the middle of this song  I don't know it  No one knows the story there  No one  Tell me  Yeah he beat up  What's her name  Daryl Hannah  Did he  Yeah he was going out with her  And decided to smack her around a bit  Why  Because she left Charlie Sheen  To hang out with Gordon Gekko  Yes  That's fine  I can't go with you bud  Her awful acting  Remember this horrid song  With the big huge cell phone  On the beach  That doesn't date the movie too much  Huh  Joe Jackson 
[02:25:00]  Is she really going out with him  David Bowie  Rebel Rebel  Simple Minds  Don't You Forget About Me  Donnie Iris  Love Is Like A Rock  Oh god  Remember that one  Quarter Flash  Take Me To Heart  Any Money Shakin  Is a cool song  Shakin  They play a lot  I've caught Shakin  Too many times  Enough on the Shakin  On the big tracks  Pull it out of the rotation  A little bit  Stevie Ray Vaughan  Tightrope  Journey Loving Touch  And Squeezing  Remember Rosington Collins  Don't Misunderstand Me  Oh there you go 
[02:25:30]  That's a cool song  Tom Petty Free Fallen  Oh is that song  Awful  He is  Unlistenable  You know it's  They call it classic rock  For our generation  And you realize that  Our generation  Really didn't get the job done  No  Let's be honest  It's some good stuff  Compared to the 70's rock  Come on  Free Fallen  Asia Don't Cry  Good song  Aldo Nova Fantasy  And Huey Lewis and the News 
[02:26:00]  Just a sample  We all heard the Aldo Nova story  When they played live  And did that song  They opened with it  Did it in the middle  And closed with it  Really?  Another one of those bands  With one hit  They had another song  What was it  Ball and Chain  Or something stupid like that  And I Want a New Drug  By the way  Is the Huey Lewis song  Yeah  Monkey on your back  Don't like that Huey Lewis  When I say I want a new drug  I can't tell you  How much that song  Irritates me  Yeah  I cannot express to you  Not one of my favorite  Huey songs  Is there a good Huey song? 
[02:26:30]  I want a new drug  A couple of fun Huey songs  The guy's got a great voice  Yeah  Kind of soulful  So this whole discussion  Bubble gum  This whole discussion  About Big Tracks  XM49  Leads to something finally  So I'm listening to Big Tracks  I think it was last weekend  And Night Ranger came on  With their song  You Could Still Rock in America  Yeah man  I remember that one  And I started contemplating that  Going  When couldn't you rock in America? 
[02:27:00]  Was there a point  We weren't allowed  Was there a point  Where we were actually  Going to lose the rocking  In America?  Or is it saying  That in America  You could always rock  But in other places  You no longer can  That's like saying  You can still smoke  Indoors in Ohio  That's what I'm saying  Well maybe if we hear  A little of it  We'll find out  Is that the live version?  Here it is  Yeah  I was just contemplating  And thinking it over  You could still rock in America  What does that actually mean?  Who is this?  Night Ranger?  It was Night Ranger right?  Or the other incarnation with 
[02:27:30]  Brad Gillis on guitar  He took over for Randy  After he died  Yeah  I get this confused  With damn Yankees  What year did this come out?  Were the Russians ready  To take over?  I would say 80  No later than 83  84  80  Hold it  Hold it  I'll go 84  80  It's 85  I'll say 87  87  Ooh  Give me a goddamn day  Jesus  Ooh 
[02:28:00]  But what are they  Trying to say?  Whoa  And was this song  In one of the Rocky  Movies or something?  I don't think so  It should have been  It's awful  You can still rock  In America  Well of course you can  Yeah  But they made it a big deal 
[02:28:30]  Like we fought some crazy war  In the middle of the 80s  And we got our rock back  The rock wars  Yeah  We got our rock back  And some guy with spandex  With bandanas tied around it  Won for us  Right  Shit heads  What year is it  Uh fan?  Huh?  84?  Steve's a twit  Steve knows  Oh this is  It's a  19  Steve what are they  Trying to say with this song?  You can still rock in America  Well you can  It was 1984  So politically  Was it a crazy time?  Apparently you couldn't rock 
[02:29:00]  In 1984  You could suck  Yeah  Huh?  Yeah  I think what they're saying is  I don't know and I don't care  Did I  Well you know what  The punk movement  I think it hit  So  Oh okay  Let's see what they're getting out of  Right  84 now  Right  Oh no I don't get it  Okay fine  Sorry  I was reaching 
[02:29:30]  I like the fact that you're wearing your sunglasses  On top of your head  It's a very very Hollywood thing  Thank you  I want to pick up this chair  And remove them  I'd like to see you try  Oh wow  That's a no  Ha ha he got you  He certainly did  Um  Alright enough for this  Hot  Cold  Or just right  How do you like your porridge?  Question  No it should be  F you a killer girl  How do you like it to be when you fuck her?  Creep  Just asking sir  Question sir  Also before we go to break 
[02:30:00]  I want to call someone out here  Steve one of my favorite people here  I'll be I swear to God  I didn't  Thank you man  Like Steve  Uh let's see  Yes  We all love Steve  Ooh  Especially you  Ooh I got an email from someone  And they say they love me  Aww  Elo  That's nice  And then we got in  Um we got a uh  I had to call Opie out on his abrasive emails  This morning in the office  Well fuck everyone man  I'm pissed off at everybody  I had to call him out on his abrasive emails  To the management  Like maybe  Maybe 
[02:30:30]  If there's a problem in the studio  It can be addressed in a civil tone on an email  Cause they instantly get defensive  There was  There's been a problem  With the sound of the show  Over the past week  Uh I noticed  And a lot of other listeners noticed  That Patrice  Who is normally loud  Without a microphone  Was buried in the mix  I was booming  And Opie volume was pretty good  But the show wasn't mixed right  And Opie inquired as to this  With a  Can someone please tell me 
[02:31:00]  If any of the fucking bandwidth  Has been cut from our show  And then start speculating  What would happen if it is bandwidth  Because if it is  I'm motherfucking  And I saw three responses from Elo  Where he got so defensive  Like hey  I'm in charge of the bandwidth  And I would know  If no one else adjust bandwidth  But me  By the way  I cc'd the entire world  Yeah  With everyone cc'd also  Well let's go  I just got to watch that bout  This is my impression  Of everyone 
[02:31:30]  Answer to it  Everyone at XM  Open  What a dick  I know  Well that was the point  I was making  Everyone gets so defensive  If you haven't figured it out yet  I don't give a shit  Who thinks I'm a dick  But they don't do anything  I think of it in these terms  If I get an email from anyone  Or if anyone talks to me  Or brings something up  Where they need something from me  And they go  Anthony  We got this issue  Maybe we could work  A problem  Get it worked out or something  I'll go  Okay  Let me get that  If someone comes up and goes  Hey motherfucker  Fix this shit 
[02:32:00]  I will turn around and go  You can go  Or I might to your face  Go alright we're working on it  And then I'll turn around and go  Go fuck yourself  You know what though  It's their job  Oh I know  And in the end  It's a job  And you know where it comes from  People for years  Have not done their job  Because they say fuck you  Or they do as little as possible  For as much as they can make  You know where this comes from  Since I was 18  I've been doing some form  Of professional radio  And I got walked on  For years  Year after year  After year  I was actually brought up 
[02:32:30]  A very nice guy  You talk to anyone  From my past  And they're like  He was the nicest kid in school  He always followed the rules  Called him nice guy Opie  I'm not even kidding you man  I was straight A's  You know I had like  An 11 o'clock curfew  I didn't dare  Come in later than that  I was that guy  And year after year  You just get beat up  By people  That just  You know  Taking advantage of  You being the nice guy  And one day  I woke up and said  You know what  You don't get shit  For being a nice guy  In this world  You just don't 
[02:33:00]  That was when you took  Your first life  Right  I remember  And I changed my whole  Way of thinking  Because it wasn't  Getting me anywhere  I was the boy scout  I was the straight A student  I never gave my parents  Problems  I never gave teachers  In school problems  I was that guy  Every job I had  I listened to the bosses  Even though I knew  They were full of shit  Like yes sir  Yes sir  And I just got walked on  And finally I said  You know what  I've had it with this  Nice guy shit  You were a boy scout?  I was all that crap  I went to religion camp 
[02:33:30]  I did it all  Do you still have  Religion camp?  I went on the religion camp  Don't bring it up  I want to see if he still  Has the uniform  Yeah  And if he'd wear it  Actually I don't know  If I made  I was  Were you a wee blow?  No  Honestly  The dumbest name  To call a troop of boys  These are very appropriate  Honestly  Pedophiles  We blow them all  I gotta correct myself  I was a cub scout  I never made it  That's hotter  You're cuter  Cause you know  After being a cub scout  You realize this is really  Faggoty and you know  I'd rather play basketball 
[02:34:00]  Or something  I mean  Than get promoted  To the boy scouts  I mean when you're a cub scout  It's cool  Cause you don't know any better  You're a kid  Then you see the older kids  With the same exact  Fucking baby uniform  You're wearing  You're like  You know  There's something wrong here  Baby uniform  It's awful  Short shorts  With a colored scarf  How do you not know  That homos just love  The boy scouts  They should love it  But when you're 8 or 10  You don't know any better  You're like  Ah it's kinda cool  I get to wear a uniform  With my friends  And do stupid little things  Like the Hitler you  But then you go to  Like some kind of  It's fun  Then you go to  Some kind of campsite 
[02:34:30]  And your little cub scout  Group is over here  And you see the boy scouts  Are much older  Wearing the same stuff  You're like  Oh boy  Yeah  This is how this is gonna end  No I don't think so  It's been a fun summer  I'm dropping out  I gotta move on  To something else  Dude what's creepier  Than an adult  Who's involved  With the boy scouts  It's like  There's something  Wrong  Like you know  I just feel  That as a scout  I should be  It does seem  So open to predators  And such an invite  Dude if you're a pedophile  And you don't go  To the boy scouts  You're a bad pedophile 
[02:35:00]  Oh I'd love to continue this  But there's cheerleaders  On the region  Oh boy  I'd love to bash  These pedophiles  But there's high school girls  On the region  Holy mackerel  Whoa  There they go  Oh  Hey speaking of cheerleaders  Cause now we're all over the place  And I'll get to my blackberry  In a second here  Was I the only one  That didn't shed a tear  When they were  Pulling that chick  Off the court  In the stretcher  Dude I wanted to  Push that over  I wanted to push  The stretcher over  How about an EMT saying  Stop doing your stupid cheer 
[02:35:30]  Before you paralyze yourself  Idiot  She like  Hurt herself  She did a header  Did a header  Right in the ground  And it looked like  She was gonna be paralyzed  And they get her on a stretcher  And they got her in a neck brace  And it looked like  She was gonna be okay  And in other sporting events  Like it's happening  In hockey and stuff  The guy  Or the football player  Will give you a little  Thumbs up  Like dude  I'm gonna be okay  And it looks like  I'm not paralyzed  She started doing cheers  As she's like  You know  Strapped down  To the board  She's strapped down  And the news reporting  Is like  Oh the feel good story  Of the year 
[02:36:00]  And look at the spirit  She is just  And she's doing  Her little cheers  As she's laying  Flat on her back  On a gurney  What an idiot  I hope she does  Those little cheers  When she can't move  Below the waist  And there's an orderly  Just  A nice large black orderly  Opening those stupid  Turnip root legs  Ready  And  We got turnip legs  Yes we do  We got turnip legs  How about you  Sneakers always  Look brand new  I can't feel my feet 
[02:36:30]  How about you  But she starts doing  Her cheer from the stretcher  And it's just like  Just really  Douche chills  They had me  With the autistic kids  Coming in  And shooting the three pointers  I was there  I got the moist eyes  Yes I'll admit it  But the cheerleading thing  Ugh  Stupid  Stop moving  Dumb  Be a bone fragment  Let's go to Bedbug  Bedbug  Hey what's up guys  Hey what's happening  Hey not a lot  You know  What you were saying  Earlier there Opie 
[02:37:00]  About nice guys  Finishing lives  I can totally relate  I used to be the same way  In school  And two bad marriages  Later you know  I finally realized  Hey  You know what you want  In this world  You gotta be a real asshole  That nice shit  Doesn't get you anywhere  In the real world  I'm sorry  I finally realized that  Because there's people out there  That just completely  Take advantage of that  Completely take advantage of it  I agree  I think that's why  The show  Dynamic  Works so well  Especially behind the scenes  It is  We are like a country  I am diplomacy  Opie is the military 
[02:37:30]  Like I will be the diplomat  I'll be there  Waiting  Talking  Doing that  And then all of a sudden  I'm sorry  We had to flush the bombers  And here they come  Opie  Open Bombay doors  I could write a whole book  On being a nice guy  In this radio world  You know  Oh you're gonna work  Christmas Eve  Christmas Day  New Year's  New Year's Day  Thanksgiving  I didn't  I didn't celebrate a holiday  With my family  In probably ten years  Ten fucking years  And you call those 
[02:38:00]  The happiest years  Of your life  And it was because  I was a nice guy  Going okay  I understand  Yeah I'll work  You know  And they just  They knew I was the guy  I was the guy  That was never gonna say no  So then there was years  I was living in  Western New York  And my parents  Would delay Christmas  So we could have  Christmas together  Oh that's always fun  They would delay it  They believe it's still Christmas  No it's like  December 28th  I finally get to come home  And there's presents  Still on you know  You know  Wrapped under the tree  I was that guy  Forever  Never getting raises 
[02:38:30]  And stuff  Because I didn't  Raise a stink  Like working my balls  Off at radio stations  Working no  Joke  70 80s  80 hours a week  Doing every job  Possible  And going home  Going oh fuck  How am I gonna eat today  Dragging like the pizza  You know  From the lunchroom  Home with me  And stuff  When no one was looking  How's that guy  And finally I said  You know what  Free food gentlemen  I finally said  This fucking blows  You gotta  You gotta speak up  Yeah  And boy did you  Oh yeah 
[02:39:00]  Hello  Attention  Motherfuckers  I finally snapped  I'm being honest  But I really was  Completely different  Growing up  But you went from  Pacifist  To the fucking  The Enola Gay  And Anthony show  You  I never saw  The other  I only knew you  As  Gunboat diplomacy  Yes  To defend myself  In my regular  Life  I am still nice  I'm a nice guy 
[02:39:30]  But when it comes to this  It's all business now  You know  Fuck you  If you can't get the job done  Then get someone that can  I don't want to hear it anymore  So  This was the email  I sent over the weekend  Yeah  We're gonna go inside  The show here  It's right off my Blackberry  It's  It's pretty much  To the entire  Programming staff  Of XM  Everyone sees  Subject  Channel complaints  And it just simply says  The last three or four days  I've been getting  A lot of complaints  On the quality of sound  On our channel  Please  Don't tell me  That some bandwidth  Was taken away  From the channel  Exclamation point 
[02:40:00]  Exclamation point  Exclamation point  Three  The please  Oh wait  Exclamation point  Four  When I read that please  I'm like  That please isn't a  Please tell me  It's  No  Please tell me  It was  I already know  To the answer to this  Right right  Exactly  I know bandwidth  Was taken motherfuckers  And I dare you  To prove me wrong  Bandwidth thieves  I saw someone  With a pocket full  Of bandwidth  Run out of this place  Absolutely  And he had a  Shemp haircut  And you're  100% right Anthony 
[02:40:30]  I wanted people  To sweat  When they read  That line  Please don't tell me  Please don't tell me  And then it continues  I can tell you this  I can tell you this much  Dot dot dot  Yeah  The channel sounds  Like shit  And it's much lower  Than the other channels  On the new portable  That we received Friday  Which is true  That new portable  Which one we get again  Oh  I wasn't able to listen  To it because  It wasn't activated  Every radio  They have said  Is activated  Has not been activated  And I usually 
[02:41:00]  Wind up getting  So frustrated  Trying to get it  Activated for free  That I pay for it anyway  Wait there's portables  Oh Jimmy  You should see  The brand new  Little ones  That we have  They're beautiful  They sent two of them  It's a new world  Out there  Yeah they sent two of them  Just curiosity  One for me  One for Opie  That was as they should  But why wouldn't  They send three  Because you're not  As important  Yeah  But I know that  And we all know that  And we all know  You're going to leave  The show for HBO  So they're like  You know why  Take care of them  You know we all know  That by the  I don't overrate 
[02:41:30]  My importance  But a portable unit  I don't know  You wouldn't want  One of those  All kidding aside  You really should have  Got one too  Right  They do that  Every time  That we got ours  Like I don't have  To be in the pictures  I mean you guys know  Even off the record  I don't care about that  We'd rather not have you  In the pictures  I don't blame you  It's just simpler  And it's the way  It should be  But when it comes  To behind the scenes  If you send an affordable  You could send me one  Because I'm going to  Talk about it  What was the reason  That there were  Only two sent  I don't get it  Honestly 
[02:42:00]  Because there's not  A lot of them out there  A lot  Or three  They could have  Scraped up another one  Probably  Yeah that's what I'm saying  But you know what  There's a waiting list  For these new portables  That you know  If you're not on a waiting list  It's going to be a while  Before you get your hands on them  Not Jimmy Norton  Well he'll get one soon  Paddy Jimmy  I know but it's just  You know  Could they have  Who was in charge  Of sending them  You know why Jimmy  Because you're too nice  See  Perfect example  When it comes to XM  You absolutely are too nice  I may be  Either be mean or armed 
[02:42:30]  That seems to be  The formula here  I'm not too nice  It's just you know  They could have  Whoever was in charge  You could have fucking  Thrown three in a box  If you have the juice  To get two  You can get three  Where's number three  Yeah  And if it's something  That's ONA exclusive  Because of who you guys are  That's fine  But you can send three  Instead of two  It's Opie and Anthony's show  And I'm on to something  With this nice thing  Jimmy Norton  Gets it too  I'm on to something  With this nice thing  Oh by the way  Art from Wack Bay  Stop waiting  You'll get your portable unit  That was kind of  Annoyed typing 
[02:43:00]  Wow  Alright listen  Do you want to hear  The rest of this or no  Yeah  Alright so let's  It's short so I'll start over  The last three or four days  I've been getting a lot of complaints  On the quality of sound  On our channel  Please don't tell me  That some bandwidth  Was taken away from the channel  I could tell you this much  The channel sounds like shit  And it's much lower  Than the other channels  On the new portable  That we received  Friday  Can we look into this  And find out  What we can do about it  That's all  Yeah  So then there was  A lot of emails  Oh yeah  I saw the responses 
[02:43:30]  I sat on the sideline  Watching this one  So Don Wicklin writes back  Oh besides the volume lower  What else are you hearing  Complaints about specifically  So I could go back  To operations  And find out more  I could look into this  On Monday morning  But I need more details  On audio quality problems  That people are hearing  That was not a good  Answer to me  Not good enough  No so I just wrote back  How do you solve that  How do you spell that  Please tell me  How you spell that  Yeah Jimmy needs to 
[02:44:00]  Send that message too  Please  I just wrote  Ugh  Ugh  See I don't know  How constructive  Ugh  Is gonna be  Was there an exclamation point  After it  Look  Should have been  Look  If  I personally  What about a question mark  Ugh  I personally  Causal point dot dot dot  Ugh  Can you continue  I personally  If I got that email  Would have listened  To the channel myself  And  And figured out  On my own  Figured out your own  Like oh wow 
[02:44:30]  There's something here  Yeah I hear that  That's not right  And this is a little weird  So Elk was supposed to  Yes  The disgust of not just  Turning the radio on  And listening to  Yeah it's like  Don't bother me  I already told you  There's a problem  Now it's up to you  To figure out  How to fix it  Well then  Elo got involved  Yeah then when I saw  Elo's name on there  I'm like uh oh  This one's taken off  This is gonna be a long one  Elo writes  Nothing has happened  To the bandwidth  I am the only one  Who has the ability  To change these  With Tony  Elo 
[02:45:00]  Came in like  Like the king  Going  Only I can do this  And I am assuring you  No bandwidth  Has been fucked with  You are the exact  Bandwidth you have been  Since launch  Call my cell  Yeah when I saw  Call my cell  I'm like see  Now he's gotta talk  By the way  I did not call his cell  So he writes back  Can also tell you  That your channel has  Oh no I better not  Read that one  I read that  That was a good one  Yeah  It's an email 
[02:45:30]  Proving that he really  Takes care of us  Yeah we're taking care of us  At XM  Let's see  They could be hearing  Some issues with the mix  Of voice and audio  Can't hear you guys  Etc  Not a bandwidth issue  Basically what it comes down  To is they threw in  Some new equipment  And they gotta make  Some fine adjustments  Low bandwidth would  Digitize the sound  You'd start hearing it  Almost like that  Cher song  Right  You know  Chips and Tramps and Thieves  Put on any of the  XM traffic channels  Right now  There's a bandwidth issue 
[02:46:00]  By the way  I did write back to Don  And I wrote  Just listen close to the channel  This week  And see what you hear  That's with the  Low bandwidth  It's the  Absolute  Minimum amount  Of information  Put through a pipeline  To make it  Audible  Audible  Or intelligible  Right  Without it just being  Blip blop blop blop blop  And 
[02:46:30]  Let's see  Another email from Eric  I'm trying to see  Which this one is  The big holding point is  They want you to do the show  From Howard's old  Oh  Ah  Wow  I gotta pee  Yeah  So do I  And we're back with the 
[02:47:00]  Opie and Anthony program  Hello  Got another email here  A new one  From ELO  Is this brand new  Brand new  On a fresh 
[02:47:30]  ELO email  I got CC'd  Thank you for the email  Brian  One of our listeners  Got a hold of ELO  Uh huh  They write them all the time  By the way  Yeah they love the ELO  Ah  Thank you for the email  Brian  They do a combination  Of longer and shorter breaks  Depending on what  What happens during the show  I understand your point  It's something that I will monitor  Haircut is doing okay  They always gotta pound them  On the hair  So that was the response  To this email  Hey Eric  I wanted to comment  On the commercial breaks  That have been taking place 
[02:48:00]  On XM202 lately  We should address this  By the way  This morning  This morning I decided  To time the break  Because I have been noticing  Their increasing length of time  ONA punched to their  Commercial break  At 751  This is where they went  From live broadcast  To their commercial  Outro bit  Which is pretty much  Like listening to a commercial  And they didn't come back  Live until 8 o'clock  That is just shy  Of 10 minutes  Commercial block  That's fine  That is just shy  Of a 10 minute  Commercial block  Uh huh  And then it goes on 
[02:48:30]  Blah blah blah  Blah blah blah blah  But we talk for an hour  What's the deal  Here's the deal  But what  Because people are like  Are they you know  Starting to play longer  Commercial breaks  Well we'll throw in  Some virus promos  And stuff like that  So we still have you know  Material we're throwing  At everybody  We're supposed to break  Twice an hour  Yep  But we don't like  Breaking twice an hour  Because we get into  A rhythm or a flow  And we're like you know what  We'll just continue  Until we realize  This has run its course  And then we'll finally break  That guy is a spoiled  Asshole 
[02:49:00]  Who now is taking  For granted  That sometimes  We will sit here  And do an hour  An hour 15  An hour and a half  Without taking  One single break  And then he hears  Our record by the way  The break  Is just under two hours  Without break  Just under two hours  With no break  And then he hears  Maybe he tuned in late  One day  And he tunes in  At say  Eight o'clock  Whoa  Big wigs  Stopping by to say hi  Jesus  I wonder why  He would be  Wandering around  The joint  Huh  Could that mean 
[02:49:30]  Something  I don't know  Who is he  Well look for yourself  Jimmy  It's Martin Mull  So he tunes in late  And he doesn't know  We've been on the air  For an hour straight  And then bitches  About the commercials  Shut up  You're a spoiled brat  We've spoiled you  By giving you  An hour and a half  At times  Usually an hour  Straight  Of commercial free  Talk radio  No one else  Is doing that  Shut up  Stop it  See we don't want  To stop the flow  Just cause 
[02:50:00]  We have to get in  Some dumb promo  For I don't know  Some dumb channel  So we go as long  As we can  And then we  Take our break  And then at that point  We have to regroup  Anyway  And we have to  Make up for the fact  That we just talked  For an hour  So what they do  Is they lump  Two breaks together  Right  And we try to make it  As interesting as possible  So we'll break up  The two breaks  With maybe  One of the virus promos  That Steve made  So instead of waiting  For us to go to break  And timing it  You little rat  You little rat hump  Would you stopwatch  Would you have a little 
[02:50:30]  Would you have your watch  Was it all ready  Were you waiting  For the break  What's his name  What's that dickbag's name  Brian I think  Brian  Were you sitting there waiting  Alright and now  And I consider  The bit that they play  Part of the commercial break  No you don't  Cause it isn't  It's after that  If that ran three minutes  Then we're looking at what  Five minute break  Five minutes out of an hour  Live with it  Well he goes on  Now XM has  Oh he does does he  Has half an argument  That broadcast radio does 
[02:51:00]  Twenty minutes of commercials  Per hour  But at least they break it up  Over the course of  Four breaks per hour  Personally I hate commercials  And of course would like  Zero minutes  Compared to ten minutes  Ain't gonna happen  I gotta piss  Brian  Brian we can't talk  For four straight hours  No one can  You asshole  Jesus Christ  I hate this guy  Show yourself  Show yourself  He's hiding behind  A Blackberry  Show how difficult that is  Put that up to your face  I see you  Where'd I go  This guy is hiding  At least I hide  Behind my keyboard  Look  Where am I 
[02:51:30]  I'm alone  Jimmy  I'm alone  Oh there you are  Where'd he go  I'm gone  I'm alone  It's easy to hide  On a keyboard  The funny thing is  You still allow these  Asses to get to you  Oh I hate this  Brian guy  How'd you get your  Blackberry  That's another thing  I gave up on  He got ELO's  Who was the guy  In this room  That would  Answer email  On a regular basis  Opie  I would  Constantly  You were the guy  At the old  Joint  I would spend  Hours a day  Hours  We were getting  Thousands of emails 
[02:52:00]  A day  And I would try  To write back  Everyone  And it became  An OCD thing  I'm like  I just can't delete  I gotta  Write something  For everybody  And then you know  They realize  It's a way  To try to get to me  And say how  I don't do this  For the show  And that for the show  And blah blah  You know all that  Crap that goes  Around and around  And around with the fans  And then you said  I said you know what  Fuck them all  I don't need this  Goodbye  Bye  This is what I do now  I allowed the mailbox  To fill up  Yep  And it's been filled  For eight months  Guess who gets  The fucking requests 
[02:52:30]  Dude ONA's mailbox  Is your fool  That's right  Can you forward this  To them  Filled up to the  Tippity top  Filled to the brim  With trashy emails  Like I'm gonna forward  It to you too  And go guys  Open  This guy really  Wants you to read it  No they  The emails were  Starting to influence  What I do on the show  And I'm like  You know what  I know what I do  For the show  I don't need anyone  To try to influence me  I will do what I do  I've been doing it  A long time  And if people don't like it  They go to another show  That's fine  Sort through 10,000  Viagra mortgage ads 
[02:53:00]  And you know what  I used to love  Writing back to the listeners  I used to love that  It was nice  And I would  You know  Get some nice feedback  Like normal feedback  On the show  I can't be bothered anymore  Thank you  Thanks for ruining that  For me  I do it through  MySpace.com  I love MySpace  Slash  Anthony Comia  Alright here we go  Anthony Comia  Jim Norton  Good luck spelling  Comia  K-U-M-I-E-A  C-U-M-I-A  Personally I hate commercials  And of course  Would like zero minutes  Compared to ten minutes  But if we have to have ten minutes  Can we not  Not split it up 
[02:53:30]  Can we not split it up  Meaning  Could we  Yeah  A ten minute block of commercials  Is unlistenable  And I should just go back  To terrestrial radio  And save the money  Go  Go  Oh cause it's just like that  Brian  Take your XM  Flush it down the fucking toilet  Wait  Get a terrestrial radio  And go fuck your mother  That's what I say  Well he makes a suggestion  So anyways  My suggestion is to break that ten minute block up  Into more than one segment  If only they want longer breaks  Just play a song or something  Other than a commercial  Or a repeat bit of their show 
[02:54:00]  You wanna hear a George Carlin bit  Hey let's throw those in  Maybe we can play something about  The House of Blues  Why don't we play a George Carlin  House of Blues bit  Hey idiot  We did that when we first got here  When we first got here  We did that  Sign Brian  P.S.

[02:59:00]  Here's the weird part about  Dude  I'm glad  Thanks for the phone call  Is the Daily News  Gave it  One and a half stars  And there's a picture  Of her and Wanda Sykes  Who I like  That's an awful picture  Of Wanda  And then yet  Linda Stassi gave it  Three stars  So I would like  Fan  To maybe get some audio  Of this  Because there's a big  Difference between  One and a half and three  I would use the word  Disparity  That is exactly the word  I was going for  And I couldn't find it  I almost said disparaging  But that would have been  Incorrect  I've been working on 
[02:59:30]  My vocabulary lately  It shows  That was actually  The right word  I read when I'm on  The shitter  Nice  Hope you don't take  Nice quick dumps  The shitter  I take fast ones lately  I don't get much reading in  Just don't ask me any words  That are F and on  Because I'm only up to the D's  Ah  Jesus  The way I've been going lately  I got to Aardvark  Stand up and wipe  Aardvark finished  Wow  Nice healthy one 
[03:00:00]  Boy  If you get up to like  Butrescence  It's not even a word  But I was trying to think  Of something with a B  That's a good one  Yeah  It's a good made up word  Yeah because it sounds  Really smart  But it's not  I wasn't going to  Question it  Boy that Ryan Seacrest  What a smile  Mike what's up  Well I just remember  One time you were  Talking about  Potentially going  Someplace  When Fareed was  Yes dude  It's funny you should  Say that  I'm going to  Atlanta this weekend  Thursday  Friday Saturday  And that is exactly 
[03:00:30]  What you're talking about  Looking forward to it  Well it all started  With good old  Alan Sniffen  Anthony  Yes  Explain Alan Sniffen  To the rest of the country  Alan Sniffen  Runs a New York  Radio message board  It's called  The New York  Radio message board  Here in New York  And he is  A radio insider  He's on the air  No  What does he do  He's a PD  No  A general manager  Of a station  No  Oh that's right  He's a dentist 
[03:01:00]  Yes folks  The man that runs  The New York  Radio message board  Is indeed a dentist  One of the most  Powerful men  In New York  Radio  You laugh  Does root canals  Yeah  The guy wields power  With this  Radio message board  Everybody reads  The New York  Radio message board  Everyone in the industry  Reads the New York  Radio message board  From jocks  To I believe  The owners  Of large radio  Corporations  Read the New York 
[03:01:30]  Radio message board  He gets a lot of  Posts from radio  Professionals  A lot of opinions  From people that are  In the know  And know nothing  There's a mixture  Of people  Professional radio  People  Or just listeners  That think they  Know everything  And he wields  A lot of power  The guy's got some  Juice that board  Something's mentioned  On that board  It makes the papers  The papers  The papers  Get the fluoride  Get the fluoride  So it started  With this 
[03:02:00]  On the New York  Radio message board  O&A  David Lee Roth  Rumor  From Alan Sniffen  March 9th  2006  First I want to  Make this clear  This is a rumor  Do not take this  As fact  I did not make it up  And have what I think  Is a good source  I'm hearing that  There is a possibility  That Opie and Anthony  May take over  David Lee Roth's  Spot in multiple markets  Should this happen  They would continue  With the XM show  As well  I do not have  Specifics as to  The multiple  Markets  I know this will 
[03:02:30]  Get picked up  By fan sites  All over the internet  So please remember  I am posting this  As something I've heard  Not as something  I'm stating  Is positively going  To happen  Should this happen  It would be the best  Thing for Free FM  They need a big name  Show that will work  In the target demo  O&A will  They have the track  Record to prove it  Here's what I had  To say about O&A  And Free FM  Back on February 27th  Blah blah blah  And then he  Because he loves  Being right  Or you know  Well it started there  Little rumors  And it's taken off since  And now it's in  The Daily News  Today 
[03:03:00]  Yeah  Talk of the town  We made the  Talk of the town  Section of the  New York Daily News  Is this really a town?  The local radio biz  Yeah  This is David Hinckley  By biz  He means business  I think  Right?  I guess  Yeah  Sure does it mean  The rapper  Biz Markie?  Could be  Why do I make it  Confusing for everyone?  Let's see  I'm just trying to see  What other important  Things he's writing  About today  Because it's always  A treat  Nice story about  Rob Bartlett though  Yeah it is a good 
[03:03:30]  Story about Rob Bartlett  Him and Dana Reeve  I guess you know her  Yeah he's great  Okay whatever  Alright  Talk of the town  The local radio biz  Is crackling  I think I can do  The crackling  Give me some crackling  It's crackling  It's on fire now  Oh my god  Put it out  Oh no  Crackling  Crackling  With rumors 
[03:04:00]  That Opie and Anthony  Is it crack-a-lackin  Maybe?  By the way  Hinckley  Is a dummy  You're a dummy  You know I read this  A couple times  This morning  And I'm reading it  For the third time  And I know now  Why you're gonna  Call him a dummy  I had not read this  Until just now  Hinckley  You're a dope  I have more respect  For John Hinckley's  Radio  Opinions  David Hinckley  Is the  Yeah he does  The radio column  For New York Radio  Yeah  He's in the  No guy  And this is what  He writes about us  The local radio biz  Is crackling 
[03:04:30]  With rumors  That Opie and Anthony  Former morning team  On WNAW  Wow  I like to be doing  Here the sports guys  On XM  Alright  Come on  The guy didn't know  He not  How does he not know  We were doing  Afternoons there  For that many years  Oh my god  He's an out of touch  Boob  Former morning team  On NAW  I want one of those  Retractions  Retractions tomorrow  Yes please  Rumors  That Opie and Anthony  Former morning team 
[03:05:00]  On WNAW  And currently on  XM satellite radio  Will sign a syndication deal  With CBS radio  That could include  Replacing  David Lee Roth  Current morning man  On WFNY  So far nothing official  Has been said  And a CBS spokeswoman  Yesterday  Said yesterday  That the company  Would maintain  Its policy  Of not commenting  On rumors  CBS did send out  A press advisory  Listing Roth's  Guest for the coming week  Oh  Opie and Anthony  So he's got a week 
[03:05:30]  Is that what they're saying  What does that mean  Like hey  We got him for a week  Can't fire him now  He's got someone  From Desperate Housewives  Coming in  Why are you acting  Huh  Why are you acting  That was good  I don't know  That was good acting  By Anthony  Anthony's an excellent actor  Opie and Anthony  Also declined comment  On their XM show Friday  But in an interview  Last month  Opie said  They were talking  With unnamed companies  About returning  To terrestrial radio  When the deal  Is right for everyone  This would likely mean  Continuation of their XM show  Where they like  The lack of content controls 
[03:06:00]  But 90% or more  Of our show  Anthony said  Would be suitable  For broadcast radio  So I didn't mean  In this country  By the way  I meant in like  Taiwan  All right  So a syndication deal  Would likely use  An edited version  Do you think David  Do you think  Do you  And guess what guys  CBS took O&A off  WNEW  After the infamous  August 2002  Sex and the same  They did  Wow  Can you give me 
[03:06:30]  Some details  But by then  They were a hit  And CBS's  Respect for their  Radio appeal  Is reflected in the fact  The company  Pay them to sit out  For two years  Rather than risk  Their being picked up  By a competitor  I think that's the first time  That was officially printed  Rather  Yeah  They did not want us  To compete against  Howard Stern  That is a fact  But according to Anthony  99.9%  I said 90%  Or better  Because if you  Pull the curses out  The material we talk about 
[03:07:00]  Most of it is  Completely acceptable  Here's what we should do  I think just to prepare  We never know what's  Going to happen  I was listening yesterday  To Worst of it  There was a fun bit  We did called  Where you had the  Movies edits  For TBS  Yes  I think that maybe  Some of our bits  That have been done  On this program  Which were dirty  Should be TBS cleaned up  I think we should  Didn't we do that already  Oh did you do that already  Jimmy where were you  Where  He was too busy  Being a star in Hollywood  I might have been away  Were you in Hollywood  Were you filming 
[03:07:30]  No it was  It was one of Jimmy's bits  Yeah fan  What are you talking about  Yeah it was one of your  Rants on a collar  That we cleaned up  Oh I don't even remember  Okay  I thought you were here  No maybe I was  Do we have that  He was  They're saying you were  Was I here  I just forgot  Alright  Do we have that bit somewhere  Yeah they put in those words  Oh excuse me  Let me steal another idea  Why don't we get a bunch of couples  And go on a point system  Oh I didn't remember  Okay cool  We should try to find that bit  Yeah  So well what are we going to say  About this today  There's  We  Hmm 
[03:08:00]  What can we say today  Hmm  Well  It's not false  Well  But  Things  Things  But there's  Things that need to  To be worked out  For something like that  To happen  Ironed out  Wouldn't that be  A natural thing  Like things would have  To be worked out  Cause there's a lot of  Nervous Nellies out there  Yeah  If we do this  Yeah 
[03:08:30]  Someday  Regardless of where  We're going to do it our way  Yeah  Regardless of where  With what company  With who  When  What  We would do it  Yeah it would have to be  We know what we're doing  Our way  We absolutely know what we're doing  And we know we can make this work  Yep  We know we can make  The two  The two  Entities  Coexist  You're  You're  You're  You're  Dern tootin'  Dude but I 
[03:09:00]  I'm not sure  Like you know  What the F do you think  We're going to do  Um  Exactly  I  We'd have to work  Certain things out  We got a system  That would  Absolutely work  That we don't want to  You know  Divulge  Divulge  No we don't  Cause it's a  It's a good system  It's a great system  Yeah  And it's based on the fact  That we can talk for an hour  To an hour and a half straight  Without taking a break  Let's just put it that way  Right  Right  Thank you  Love it  Thank you  Don't make you worry 
[03:09:30]  We will never  Sacrifice  This program  That's right  Darn sticky  For anything like  Our own  Needs  Or wants  It's been  It's been a very  Interesting couple  Of weeks  Retribution  Or vengeance  Or anything else  It's been a very  Interesting couple  Of weeks  Yeah  Because uh  The company that  Absolutely hated us  And hoped that we'd  End in jail  For what we did  Yeah  That's forgave 
[03:10:00]  That's forgave  There's been uh  There's been some uh  Some talk of  Forgive and forget  Forgive and forget  That's nice  And that makes me  Very uh  Very uh  Warm inside  And a lot of people  Um that were there  Back in the dark ages  The dark days are gone  And people that are there  Are very well liked  Very well respected  By uh  Me  And others on this program  There seems to be a lot of people  Uh that get this program over there 
[03:10:30]  Yeah  Exactly  And they don't have  Howard Stern  Cock blocking anymore  Mmhmm  So it's uh  It's an interesting  It's an interesting time  For the Opie and Anthony program  Yeah  But don't worry about  The uh  Sanctity  Of this program  That you are hearing  Because we will never  Um sacrifice that  Don't you worry  People on this show  Will always be garbage  Let's go to Mike in Philly  Hey Ope  Yeah  When you were going to go  To read last time  You said yourself  That the show  Got came down  For a little while  Hey dickhead 
[03:11:00]  Yeah  Watch your mouth  You FNC  What are you talking about  When we were broadcasting  Uh to um  One of the Citadel stations  I think  Ope  You said it yourself  Listen to the piece  Hey hey hey hey  Hey  We know  You're absolutely right  It did get toned down  And that stunk  No this  That was an experiment  Shut up  Take a long walk off a short pier  Wait  Now if that doesn't tell you  Nothing's changing  I'll tell uh  This is what Mike is referring to  A little over a year ago  We got word that Citadel  Uh Fareed's company there 
[03:11:30]  Wanted to take Howard off  A couple of his stations  And throw the Opie and Anthony show on  Yep  We knew there were some  Um high powered people  Listening to our show  And we knew  And I'm being dead serious  That they weren't smart enough  To figure it out  So we figured we'd make it  As easy as possible  To these people  Yeah  So we toned down the show  For about a week  No one by the way  Noticed  Yeah  No one noticed  As far as the listeners  Of this program  Uh go  But we did it  Because we know  These dummies were listening  And we had to make it  As easy as possible 
[03:12:00]  For them  So they could uh  Make their decision  Yep  Absolutely that happened  We stopped cursing  And we did a few other  Little adjustments  And it worked perfectly  Because they said  Okay this could be on  Regular radio  They signed us  To a very short term deal  That was a complete disaster  Because they didn't know  What they were doing  Which proved my point  That they're a bunch of dummies  Yeah  And we went right back  To doing uh  The exact show  And then it was up to them  To figure out how that worked  For uh regular radio  Yeah  Yes  Yes Mike  You're right  You're right 
[03:12:30]  But that was well over  A year ago  Yeah  And the uh  The plan wasn't enacted  We have the plan  We have the plan  We have the system  Because we learned  From that by the way  We now have  The plan  It's a great plan  By the way  And if you don't like  Listening to this show  Why don't you just  Go by a serious  And throw your ex  Come down the toilet  And hug your mother  Right  How about this  How about this  What Opie  How about what  We wouldn't  We would just do  An extra hour a day  Thank you  Oh wow 
[03:13:00]  I bet you idiots  Didn't think of that  Did ya  Didn't think of that one  Did ya  Did ya  Well  Your buddies don't mind  Doing more radio  We love more radio  We're not looking  Cause the money goes  Through the roof  Right  We're not looking  To do less radio  Who's out there  Looking to do less radio  Maybe four days a week  The Jews  Got the plan  We have the greatest plan  We have a plan  Yes  Right now there's a lot  Of repeats on this channel 
[03:13:30]  Uh huh  What if there weren't  As many repeats  Wait  What if O&A  Were doing a little more radio  Wait but I  What if other people  Associated to this show  Started to do  A few other things for us  Enough said  I gotta go home  I don't wanna do  Eight hours a day  We love doing more radio  Are you tired  I'm sorry  Unlike uh  You know who  How about four day work  Uh weeks  Nah  The audience gets mad at me  If I take a week off 
[03:14:00]  I can't take Fridays off  I think the audience  Would rather have you  Four days  Than no days  Yeah if you're not there at all  Well it's better not to be there  I believe radio is a habitual  Kind of medium  That people wake up in the morning  They go to work  And they wanna hear their favorite disc jockey  Oh absolutely  And if you're not there on Fridays  You are doing a disservice to the audience  And you're not doing your job  You're not doing it right  That's like  That's like someone going to work  And doing a half ass job  That's like you hire a guy  To do a job  And he kinda just sleeps on the job  And he just sorta gets by  It's like being the president 
[03:14:30]  Right  Right now  Yeah  Exactly  So it's all or nothing then  All or nothing for me  How about  If you're gonna do this job  You show up every day  And you give it your best  You know  I'm not gonna come and do this show  And jip my audience  Aw  Not gonna do it  Well he has uh  Begun to take Fridays off  To jip his audience  That's why  That's why we love that clip  Jip  And the guy in the suit  Outside the studio  Loved that clip by the way  He's laughing really hard  That's a good one  Uh 
[03:15:00]  Let's go to Ninja  In Carolina  Ninja  Yeah  Make it really fast  Cause there's a lot of questions  We're gonna do a quick round here  And then we gotta take a break  The biggest question is  I just bought XM Radio  Just because of you guys  And um  I'm moving up to New York  In about  Five more months  I moved down to this  Fucking godforsaken state  About six months ago  And  I  I stopped listening to you guys  Because these guys  Left the radio  Because of that bullshit  We're not leaving XM  Next caller  Paul  That's what he was getting at  Right  Paul  Yeah  Paul

[03:21:30]  Or swallowed water  Jesus  But I mean  It's  Every year  You read about  When we have these  Cold winters  Sometimes  You read about  People that bring  Hibachis  Into their kids room  Like a barbecue  And put it in there  And it throws off  A lot of heat  And they wake up  And the kids are dead  And they go  Oh why  Why  Why  Because  It's a barbecue  And it's  It's pulling oxygen  Out of the room  And making carbon monoxide
