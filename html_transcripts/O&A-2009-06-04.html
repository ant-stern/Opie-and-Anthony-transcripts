<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts delaying the start due to Anthony's tardiness, stemming from a fatal car accident he witnessed on the LIE.  They then transitioned into a review of their recent "epic" tax rant, which aired on Breitbart.tv, analyzing their performance and poking fun at Jimmy's perceived lack of contribution.  The hosts offered contrasting viewpoints on Obama's Egyptian speech, particularly his foreign policy concerning Iran.  This led to a discussion of the Eminem/Bruno Mars MTV Movie Awards stunt and the ethical considerations surrounding Sacha Baron Cohen's hidden camera work in *Borat* and *Bruno*, including a detailed account of a lawsuit against Cohen.

The show continued with speculation about the cause of a fire at a Maine topless coffee shop, which then unexpectedly segued into a discussion about Simona Halep's physique and athleticism, accompanied by an online image search punctuated by complaints about intrusive advertisements.  This tangent included a mention of a tennis player's excessive moaning during a match and a lengthy recollection of the hosts' juvenile antics, specifically a game called "elbow titting," followed by a mention of the website "Fatty Rock."

The next segment featured a listener-submitted video of a pole vaulter getting hit in the groin, followed by a review of the movie "Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park," with Jimmy detailing its poor acting and special effects, including hilarious clips from the film.  This prompted listener calls and a discussion of Kiss, their solo albums, and more clips from the film. A substantial portion revisited the Breitbart.tv featured "epic tax rant," again criticizing Jimmy's performance, interspersed with humorous celebrity ID’s containing mispronounced names and nonsensical messages.  This section concluded with a discussion about a female tennis player planning breast reduction surgery, leading to a contest to create a website to dissuade her and further discussion about her body, a bizarre hypothetical involving filling a room with semen, and more listener calls, with Jimmy Norton heavily involved.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a bizarre calculation of how long it would take to fill a room with semen, which evolved into a similar calculation with menstrual blood, fueled by listener calls suggesting various entry points, including a chimney.  Crazy Kenny, an aspiring radio personality, performed a crude demo for a SiriusXM morning show audition, his large, worn shoes becoming a recurring joke.  Other segments included a discussion of competitive volume maximization among board operators, detailed calculations of the volume of menstrual blood or bodily fluids required to fill the studio, and a humorous recounting of an unpleasant hallway encounter between Opie and Artie Lange. A *Family Guy* reference, a debate on Kenny’s audition, and Opie's recounting of an argument with Artie Lange and other Howard Stern personnel also took place.


The final segment covered a news story about a South Carolina funeral home that had to close after an employee admitted to shortening a deceased minister's legs to fit him into a standard casket without family permission.  The hosts and callers speculated on how the family discovered this (rumors, misaligned feet), debating the ethics and prevalence of such practices. This sparked vulgar jokes and tangents about grammar ("exhumation" vs. "exhume"), embalming fluid, and listener-submitted puns.  A caller identifying himself as "Ghoulish Corpse Fucker," a funeral home director, briefly discussed the practicality of fitting bodies into caskets. A pre-recorded bit by "Crazy Kenny" with crude humor and sexual innuendo was played. Rob Bartlett called in to discuss his son's charity walk, and the segment concluded with more death-related jokes and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  We tried a little stall tactic.  Because everyone's like...  That's pretty accurate, too. That's exactly what they said.  That's what I just read off the end of feedback.  What's up?  We're stalling for our pal Anthony, but I think we've got to start. 
[00:00:30]  He'll be here soon. He's in a jam on the LIE because it's pouring out today.  This is a great story as far as the LIE goes.  Some guy, I don't know if he was drunk, he's flying down the service road.  You've got these service roads where you live, I'm sure.  You've got the main highway, and then you've got the service road.  And a lot of people take the service road and go 70, 80 miles an hour if they can.  And this guy lost control of his car.  Hit a house.  Burst into flames, I believe. 
[00:01:00]  Wow.  And he is dead.  But somebody was sleeping all nice in their house.  All of a sudden, this car.  You just don't expect that when it's not the highway.  Is that what Anthony's stuck in right now?  I don't know if they shut down the LIE for that one.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  I don't think so.  I don't know.  He was supposed to be here right around 6.  I'll be here.  Whatever.  If it happened in Long Island, it may be causing a lot of people to take an alternate route,  which would be the LIE. 
[00:01:30]  Because a guy goes through a house that fucks up traffic.  That could be a problem.  There's certain things in traffic that are really legitimate traffic claims.  Like, oh, I was in traffic.  Guy went through a house.  All right, that's legitimate.  That's pretty legit.  We made Breitbart, too.  Yes.  I guess we could give everybody the O&A news.  Breitbart.  What is it?  Breitbart.com?  Breitbart TV, I think.  Oh, Breitbart.tv.  B-R-E-I-T-B-A-R-T dot TV.  They took a tax rant we did a few days ago. 
[00:02:00]  And they're calling it.  What's the headline on that thing?  Epic tax rant.  Open Anthony hosts crank up epic half-hour anti-tax rant.  Epic?  Yeah.  What?  They don't listen to our show, do they?  They must listen to a lot of boring radio.  So to them, that's like, oh, my God, listen to these guys.  It was a good break.  Good break on taxes.  That was 30 really hard minutes on taxes.  But, like, really speaking honestly. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  And, of course, whenever this show comes up on any website, I panic.  I'm like, all right, we're getting fired.  Something happened.  Of course.  And it was actually a good thing.  You know, it was because I think that they must have loved the rant.  Uh-huh.  And I'm listening to it 25 minutes.  You guys were brilliant.  You really were good.  And I contributed.  It was funny.  Nothing.  It was funny.  I was listening to you through the rant.  Dude.  Because you were playing like silly guy.  Yeah.  You know, I mean, Jimmy, obviously, extremely intelligent and could hang in there with the best of them. 
[00:03:00]  But during that particular rant, you were being, you were coming up with all your silly characters.  What were you, literal guy?  I did literal Joe.  A couple times, I'm like, why is that?  I just had nothing.  And if you don't know the show, you're like, who is this asshole?  Dude, all I'm thinking as I'm listening to that is if I was an outsider going, who the fuck is this guy?  Wasn't he shut up?  Uh, I was thinking the exact same thing.  Dude, it was driving me nuts. 
[00:03:30]  People don't know Jimmy.  They must think, wow, they must have let some, like, college radio guy do the show with him one day.  It was, uh, and there was one, and I'm like, I said something about England, and you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was so bad.  It sounded so bad.  Yeah.  What a fool I was.  But I was just happy that there was nothing, uh, nothing detrimental.  I kept waiting for the fucking, the bomb, like, the thing that was, it was up there for it.  No, it was just a great rant.  You can't worry anymore. 
[00:04:00]  They'll get us eventually.  What can I tell you?  It's just how it is.  Uh, Obama.  He's got a big speech in, uh, Egypt right now that everyone's covering.  Everybody.  It's on every freaking channel.  What is he doing in Egypt, Jimmy?  He's, it looks like, uh, he is just walking around the world talking about Muslims and  Islam and trying to, uh, I guess, mend fences.  I mean, I don't know if it's, it looks weak, but I don't know if it's weak or if it's his  way of saying, uh, the only way to deal with these extremists is to have Muslim leaders on 
[00:04:30]  your side and have them deal.  I mean, maybe that's his strategy.  I don't know.  Why do we have to deal with the Muslims?  I mean, there's only 1.6 billion of them.  I know.  You can't exactly ignore them right here.  Maybe if there was a few, you're like, ah, but one thing I liked that he said, even  though I didn't agree with it, is you're saying that Israel, I mean, Iran, he's like, hey,  we can't impose our rights, our will on them.  And he's right.  It's like, I get sick and tired of the US being the world's policemen.  I'm tired of it. 
[00:05:00]  I don't, I'm sick of telling every other country what to do.  They just wind up hating us.  Uh, Israel can handle Iran.  If there's a problem with Israel and Iran, Israel will handle it.  They don't need us.  No, it's weird.  Anthony's agreeing with everything today.  Right, Anthony?  Look, he's just nodding.  He's nodding.  Anthony's a bigger Obama fan.  I knew he loved Obama.  Of course he does.  He's listening right now.  He's probably screaming at his radio.  I bet you he kind of agrees with that.  Maybe he doesn't.  I don't know.  You don't agree with nothing when it comes to Obama. 
[00:05:30]  I'd like to ask him what he thinks about that.  Maybe he agrees with a couple tiny little things.  Well, it's like we, we.  Tiny, tiny, tiny little ones.  Iran is going to get nuclear weapons.  I personally don't care if they have them or not.  As long as they don't sell them to, uh, to terrorists.  That's my only concern.  Eventually, uh, the wrong people will get the nuclear weapons and do something really stupid.  And hopefully we can figure it out and survive as human beings.  Oh, I hope not.  Period.  Thank you.  Dude, I was the fucking, I should have come and work in a dress today.  I was the hole on that entire tax rent.  I will fucking.  Can we isolate Jimmy's part? 
[00:06:00]  Dude, it was so bad.  It's the only time audio from this show has ever been taken in a positive light and put  on a fucking news site.  Ever.  And I contribute nothing in 30 minutes.  You weren't literal Joe.  You were something Joe.  I was literal Jim.  Oh, regular Joe.  Regular.  You were trying out your regular Joe character.  Because it's just, it's what we, you know, people who listen to the show just know it's  just Jimmy being an ass.  I was rooting for you to sound stupid the whole time I was listening to him. 
[00:06:30]  Like, there's Jimmy again.  Dude, it was obvious.  It was really stupid.  And like, they don't even know.  They don't even know.  Ah.  Ant's walking down the hall.  The very long hallway.  We have any guests today?  We were supposed to have Norman Lear.  Yesterday he canceled all press though.  He's an older man.  He's probably not feeling well.  I heard he's got the swine flu, so.  Oh no.  I wish him nothing but the best.  That's what I'm hearing.  I don't know.  I don't know if it's true or not, so.  How old is Norman Lear?  He's got to be fucking 85 years old.  I was thinking 58.  Something like that.  He was three when he did it all in the family.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:07:00]  Huh?  Stupid walk down the hallway.  The very long walk down the hallway.  Oh my god.  Puddles!  Hi.  Good morning.  Puddles!  Puddles?  Yeah.  What's wrong with puddles?  Apparently people don't like driving through them.  Oh.  Oh!  Where the parkway and the expressway come together, there's this giant lake.  Right.  And it's not like people are driving 53 Packards anymore.  You could go through puddles and your car won't stall.  Just drive. 
[00:07:30]  Puddles.  Drive!  Curse in the puddles.  This just in by CokeLogic, so we got the big rant on Breepart, and Drudge will be covering  yesterday's Roomful of Cum segment, so that's very good.  Getting a lot of exposure today for the show.  I was listening to the Opie and Anthony show on my way in.  Yeah.  I don't know if you heard that, just that rant, how good you guys were.  It really was impressive.  It just, it was great.  No, don't even...  I had...  It's not about that.  It's about you sounding like...  Well, that's the point I'm making, is that... 
[00:08:00]  Average Joe...  It sounded like...  Hysterical.  It was just this really interesting thing.  And the hole keeps piping in.  I'll be darned.  What is that?  We're getting it...  Yes.  We're getting your parts isolated.  Dude.  I can't wait to hear it now.  They were fucking terrible.  That's the only thing I want to hear now.  Do they ever...  I did laugh.  That's a muckety...  Do they ever...  No, there's a couple things.  I have to hear it again.  When I said the muckety-muck slide, I was like, just shut up.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  Just shut up.  You know what it is?  You never think a break like that is going to make the news. 
[00:08:30]  So when you're going like, average Joe.  Well, that's what I was saying, man.  Regular guy.  You were probably in the elevator.  I was like, you know, it's a good break.  They're looking at it like it's an amazing rant that we...  That's just one of our breaks.  They must listen to a lot of really boring radio.  So to them, it's like, holy shit.  Listen to what these guys are doing.  They're really tearing it up about those taxes by gum.  And that Jim Norton.  Yeah.  He sure told them.  Start taping now. 
[00:09:00]  You know, somebody once said, no taxation without representation.  And then big tits fell out.  Wait, that's not late.  Wrong.  Boo.  Boo.  Oh, what a dope.  Yeah.  What a dope.  Made a good listen.  Oh, dude.  I was just laughing after a while.  I'm like, because sometimes you guys will be clicking on something.  It's fun to kind of like fucking hang out and really just be here and not say anything.  And I'm just going, no.  But I'll chime in with a line once in a while.  But if it's happening and you guys have this thing, what the fuck do I do? 
[00:09:30]  Jump in and step on it?  It's going.  Well, you're supposed to bring in your phone bill, Ant.  That was the...  Yes.  That's what started that whole damn thing.  Exactly.  We got to look at that phone bill again.  Yeah.  That was the one going off about all the different taxes on the phone bill and everything.  So, uh...  Surcharges on fines and parking tickets and, uh...  And where is it all going?  Where is it all going?  Exactly.  What are we trying to do?  Correcto mundo.  What are we trying to do?  The break again?  Trying to get more, uh, more press.  Breitbart.tv's got the break in their, uh... 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  I still don't like Breitbart.  No?  No, no, no.  They haven't been, uh, too positive.  Haven't kind?  No.  Nudes.  They, uh...  Nudes.  Nudes.  Since that one...  Since that, uh, Homeless Charlie thing...  Eh, give us a couple more positive things and then we'll...  Then I'll turn my opinion around on Breitbart.  Yeah, it was the Homeless Charlie thing.  I still say it that way.  Breitbart.  Bre...  But it's...  Bre...  It's...  Breitbart.  Where are we, by the way?  Are we really buried on the website there, uh, Danny? 
[00:10:30]  No, you're, uh...  No.  You're front and center.  Ooh!  What is that?  Oh, shit.  That was a prime spot right there.  Yeah, that is.  That's a very nice...  It says Opie and Anthony hosts crank up epic.  They're calling it epic!  It's epic, Opie.  It's not epic.  It should have said Opie and Anthony hosts and some fucking chick that came in and contributed  nothing.  Our standards are way higher than Breitbart.  It was a very good break.  It wasn't epic.  It's epic. 
[00:11:00]  You want to hear epic.  Well, epic...  Doesn't epic mean, uh, isn't...  It could be about the size of it, too.  It's epic is like, uh...  I mean, I don't know the actual...  Epic!  Like, yeah.  Yeah, huge.  It's kind of like big.  Yeah.  That was a long tax rant, man.  You guys covered...  Maybe long.  That's what they meant.  Jeez.  A long-winded...  Yes, epic.  A lot of hot air.  Spielberg edited this one.  You know what I wish...  I wish more than anything that during that rant...  That I would have died during that story?  Well, that would have helped.  During that rant, you, uh, decided to do Ted the tax man. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, yeah!  Let's...  We now quote Ted.  Right?  Yes.  Theodore Sheckler once said...  Theodore.  Go, sis...  Don't pay taxes.  Back to you.  A brilliant financier, Ted Sheckler...  ...was in the studio.  Let me tell you!  Ted...  I don't like to pay tax because sometimes they poke my bottom.  Oh, other kinds of tax.  I apologize. 
[00:12:00]  This is a tax rant about thumb taxes.  All right.  Well...  Jesus.  So we got that going on today, which is really, really cool.  Which is nice.  Very, very nice.  Eminem admits brutal encounter with stage, finally.  I was just, uh...  I don't know who I was talking to.  I just babble and hope someone listens to me in the morning before the show.  But I was saying, if you're going to do a stunt like the Bruno thing at the MTV Movie Awards,  and Eminem is involved, and there's a bunch of people involved, 
[00:12:30]  why don't you just all keep your mouth shut and just say no comment?  You said it to me.  Why do you have to eventually tell everybody that it was a stunt?  Oh, they did.  I mean, we knew it was a stunt, but a lot of people weren't really sure,  and they would have questioned it for a while.  So just keep your mouth shut.  Mongoloids?  Who the hell didn't know, you know?  It's like...  Well, now they're trying to spin it like Eminem was in on it,  but he didn't know that it was going to be, you know, nothing on his bottom.  Shut up.  What did he think Bruno was going to do? 
[00:13:00]  Didn't you see the trailer?  Yeah.  It was going to be something uber gay, you dummy.  And you know his people looked into it.  Of course.  He knows who fucking Sasha Barron is.  Eminem is very protected, very particular, barely does press.  Everything has to be thought out big time.  He knew exactly how the stunt was going down and what Bruno was going to wear.  But I don't understand now.  They just blow it.  They're doing this fake edge, and then they do it.  They sort of pull it off, and now they have to tell everyone it was fake.  It's like, just shut your mouth. 
[00:13:30]  I think it's like no comment.  I think they realized how...  I think when seeing it...  Stupid it is.  They probably realized, they probably heard some of the criticisms and realized this  is embarrassing.  You know, 10, 15, 20 years ago, it was all like, they'd show a clip on the news and go,  oh, maybe.  But then all these bloggers and internet people, they probably just got torn apart so bad for  it.  Like, we have to just admit it.  Here's the quote from Eminem.  Sasha called me when we were in Europe, and he had an idea to do something outrageous at  the movie awards.  I'm a big fan of his work, so I agreed.  I agreed to get involved with the gag. 
[00:14:00]  Eminem told Rap Radar.  See, and he said he's a fan of his work, so he knows.  I mean, he had to have seen fucking clips of him with his face in a fat man's asshole.  I'm thrilled that we pulled this off better than we rehearsed it.  So, there you go.  He must have realized he's looking like an idiot.  I was looking at the Bruno trailer.  Bruno.  And now, I might be leaning toward how Jimmy thinks about the whole Borat thing.  They have a scene on the trailer with Richard Bay doing a talk show. 
[00:14:30]  He used to be a talk show host.  Yeah.  And I think they're trying to set it up like it's a real talk show host.  And I'm thinking maybe the way they do it is they tell people we're starting a new talk  show host.  And then they bring the people in, and then they film this for Bruno, right?  The women that get up in the audience of the trailer, and I don't think I have to explain  it because everyone's watching this trailer, they're actors.  It's so obvious they're actors. 
[00:15:00]  A lot of...  Because Bruno comes out with the black kid.  I'll tell you this much.  And Richard Bay goes, what did you name the kid?  And Bruno goes, a typical black name, OJ.  So the big black women in the audience are outraged by that.  Are they?  And they get up, and they're doing the moves and stuff.  It's like, this is...  They're actors.  They're acting.  Yeah.  And Jimmy kind of pointed out that's one of the reasons why you didn't dig the Borat as  much as a lot of other people did.  I didn't like the movie, but I'm not shitting on him. 
[00:15:30]  I think he's brilliant.  I think the show was hilarious.  Yeah.  I just didn't like it when anyone was in on the gag.  Yeah, that makes it the best.  It's great when no one knows what's going on.  But those are the funniest clips when he walks into a situation and nobody has a clue that  he's being an asshole.  I loved Borat until he finally met Pam Anderson.  And I'm like, oh my God.  That is so...  Yeah.  What are you doing?  That's your big finale?  A set up bit?  With Pam Anderson? 
[00:16:00]  Kind of took us out of the mix when the big fat black hooker was in our stupid TV pilot.  Right.  Right.  You know, it's like, all right, well, maybe she's not a big black hooker.  But still, the Bruno thing, I want to go on record, it looks like it's going to be pretty  damn funny.  Yeah, you just can't take it as, okay, this is all real and obviously a lot of put-ons.  Well, I wonder how much is real and how much is a put-on.  Because now when you go back and look at Borat, you're like, oh, okay. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, okay.  All right.  They were in on it.  They weren't, you know.  But all during the filming of this thing, and even Borat, like you'd hear about him  doing things that outraged people, and you wonder how much of it is real and how much  is, you know, the publicity agents just going at it.  As Danny finds that part I was talking about with Richard Bay, speaking of what's real and  what's not, woman sues comedian over Bruno Skirmish.  So this one was real. 
[00:17:00]  Oh, here's the talk show thing.  Parents, please welcome Bruno.  So what's the baby's name?  I gave him like a traditional African name.  O.J.  What?  This is a swingers party, right, guys?  How are you?  Oh, hi.  This is a different trailer.  And is Richard Bay, like, where is his talk show?  No.  Huh?  Where's Richard Bay's talk show?  That's what I'm saying.  He used to be a talk show.  So I'm thinking, you know, you can get an audience and say, hey, we're filming a talk show.  Yeah.  And then film something for a movie and they're not in on it. 
[00:17:30]  But the problem with that is that was an actress.  Yeah.  It's so obvious.  Yeah, man.  This is a lot of this looks very put on.  How do you protect yourself from a dildo?  We're looking for a locksmith.  We're looking for shit.  Get out of here.  This has ended.  You're not burning hell for that one.  Say the actor.  Whatever.  I was watching a different trailer yesterday.  There's a whole bunch of different ones online. 
[00:18:00]  Whatever.  I just made the dumb point.  A woman sues comedian over Bruno Skirmish.  Sacha Baron Cohen's new movie isn't in theaters yet, but it's already producing the same sort  of buzz and legal backlash that his last hit Borat created.  Rochelle Olsen sued the 37-year-old actor at NBC, claiming an incident at a charity bingo  tournament that was filmed for the upcoming Bruno left her disabled.  Disabled?  Yelled bingo and then kicked her in the teeth.  Olsen claims she was severely injured after struggling with Cohen and his film crew at the 
[00:18:30]  event held in California two years ago.  The lawsuit states she now needs a wheelchair or cane to move around.  They're only looking for 25 Gs.  No.  That's it?  No, no, no.  What?  Undisclosed amount beyond 25 Gs.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  All right, so it's going to be more than 25 Gs.  It was unclear whether the incident involving Olsen will appear in Bruno.  The lawsuit mentions contracts that Olsen apparently signed but claimed they were entered under  duress and included several misrepresentations. 
[00:19:00]  I want to know what the freaking thing was.  All right, so Cohen was invited to this event, this bingo thing, I guess, right?  Identified as a celebrity who was filming a documentary on bingo.  So the event was to raise money for nursing students.  According to the lawsuit, Cohen and characters Bruno started using vulgarities while calling  the second bingo game in front of a mostly elderly audience.  That is funny.  All right, see?  That's funny.  Give them that one.  Yeah, but old codgers enjoy a good fuck every once in a while. 
[00:19:30]  They sure do.  Yep, just ask the orderlies.  A struggle ensued after Olsen tried to grab the microphone away from Cohen.  She claims he then called his camera crew over who attacked her for at least a minute,  hoping to create a dramatic emotional response.  Olsen's suit states she ran for the stage and was found moments later by a co-worker sobbing  uncontrollably.  She then fell to the floor, hitting her head on a concrete slab.  Brain bleeding.  Not good.  Not good.  Not good.  Oh, so there you go on the Bruno thing. 
[00:20:00]  But you know what?  It's gotten a lot of press.  Eminem and Bruno are both getting a lot of press for their, and Eminem's audience, I  mean, Eminem has a black rap audience, but he has also a real suburban audience, too.  Yeah.  A real white audience.  They're called wiggers.  But no, I like Eminem.  I'm going to buy his new one.  Well, I'm not a wigger.  You were.  I was a teenager before it was fashionable.  I was nowhere near a wigger, and I've liked everything Eminem has done, believe it or 
[00:20:30]  not.  Everything.  And you put one of those CDs on and get past the hits, it's just good to listen to.  Yeah.  And I don't buy rap stuff whatsoever.  No.  Matter of fact, I think Eminem is the only one I've downloaded in the last, I don't know,  five, six, seven years.  Maybe, yeah.  I'm trying to think if I've ever downloaded another rap album.  I don't think so.  I'll listen every once in a while.  Every once in a while.  No, I like parents just don't understand. 
[00:21:00]  That's a good one.  That's about when I stopped listening to the hip-hop.  Because that's what you have to say to a girl when her parents are like, we don't want  that older man here.  We don't want one of our friends dating you.  Oops.  Johnny Russ writes, guys, just watch Borat slash Bruno and laugh.  There's no need to over-examine.  Man, I guess you're right.  I mean, the Borat movie is still fantastic.  But I'm not tearing it apart. 
[00:21:30]  I'm only saying that's why I didn't enjoy it.  To me, that's just what I didn't like about it.  Well, the Richard Bay thing just bothers me.  I mean, with the actresses and stuff, I think he could have probably pulled that off without  setting up actors in that particular skit.  And it's when it's presented as this is really happening kind of a thing, and then you realize  it's bullshit, then it's like, eh, meh.  You know, if you understand it's a movie, and there's going to be fake stuff in it, like  a movie and not a documentary, that's one thing. 
[00:22:00]  But when it's presented like, oh, he puts himself in these outrageous situations, it kind  of takes you out of it when you watch it.  I'm sure that, I mean, the Bruno on his show, on the L.A.G. show.  Sorry, that flag behind Obama looks inappropriate when you see it at a glance.  What?  That little white piece of flag looks like, it really looks like a KKK hood.  Oh, wow, yeah.  When you kind of see it out of the corner of your eye.  Yeah, it does.  It's a red curtain with a red flag, and there's a little pointy white piece of the flag, and 
[00:22:30]  you're like, move, get out of the way.  Out of my peripheral, I'm like, ooh, Jesus, wow, he is making friends.  I don't think you're fully awake yet.  I think you get to see fun stuff in the morning.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  What else are you seeing?  It's like the cartoons where all of a sudden they see a person, and they're hungry, and  they see a, I don't know.  Oh, a steak or something.  Jimmy turns into a burger.  Yeah.  Why not?  A burger would have said more important things during that tax rant. 
[00:23:00]  Put pickles on me.  Why don't we have it yet?  I know it's a half hour, but I'm very excited, because Jimmy picked up on exactly what I  picked up.  How could you not pick up on it?  I would have contributed more if I just began snoring through it, loudly.  The one time, all I kept saying is the one time that audio from this show is not put  in a place where it's going to get everybody fucked.  Yeah, exactly.  It's looked at it in a positive light, and I am just sucking a bunch of dicks verbally. 
[00:23:30]  You were the whole.  You were.  I wasn't, but the whole can at least say something entertaining.  I was just blathering out nonsense.  Well, if people don't know the context, too, of your regular Joe guy and Ted.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the beauty of it.  That's why the listeners are going to laugh their asses off when they hear just the isolated  parts of Jimmy and this very serious tax rant that is now on Breitbart.tv.  Yeah, because, yeah, it's like I don't mind talking taxes, and I don't mind listening. 
[00:24:00]  The conversation was very interesting that Ope and Ant were having.  It really was.  So I didn't mind not contributing to it.  But for it to be on Breitbart, I would just rather have said nothing than what I said.  Do you want the listeners to try to explain that in the comments section of Breitbart?  I really would like them to explain it.  Sure, they'll do a great job.  I'd like them to explain it nicely that Jimmy is not nearly as stupid as he's out in this clip.  Jimmy's a smart boy who did well in school up until eighth grade. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, very bad news.  Oh, no.  A business we've talked about off and on over the years burned down last night.  Fire officials, arson destroyed, blank shop in Maine.  Dildo shop?  The dildo shop, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  I buy my toothbrushes there.  The dildo shop.  Is it the dildo shop?  Head shop.  The head shop, Anthony.  No, he didn't say give yourself a bell.  So I don't think it was the head shop. 
[00:25:00]  I'll say it when you get it.  In Maine?  Maine?  Give yourself a bell.  Fire?  Coffee?  Java log.  No.  It was like we were playing Password.  The password is?  What kind of coffee shop?  Which pretty much gives it away.  Pretty much gives it away.  Starbucks?  No. 
[00:25:30]  Coffee?  I used to love that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You already said that, dummy.  So I go coffee.  And you say Starbucks.  Starbucks.  So instead of going, all right, well, all right, he's on to the coffee thing.  Then the dummy goes, coffee?  Again.  Grounds.  Coffee?  Cup.  Oh, good, good.  Cup is good.  Cup.  In this case.  Coffee shop.  Main.  Fire. 
[00:26:00]  Now we got cup.  Cup.  Cup is definitely a good clue.  Give me one more clue.  One more clue.  No.  I'm emphasizing that cup is a good clue.  Oh.  Cup?  Coffee.  Coffee?  Cup.  I love when they do that, too.  Like they switch it around and give you the thing you just gave them?  All right.  Coffee cup.  Cup?  I said that.  You know who I used to hate in game shows? 
[00:26:30]  And thank God he's now a stroke victim.  Oh, God.  Dick Clark.  I fucking hated him on that $10,000 pyramid.  Oh, Mr. Pompous, I know the answer beforehand.  Yeah, Mr. I know all the answers at the end of the show and watched me look really good  just before the credits roll.  He'd tell the people, don't turn around.  Don't turn around now.  Right.  And he'd start giving people the clues.  Right.  It's like, well, you had time to think about it.  Of course.  You knew the answer.  Of course.  Don't look at the phone because someone's got the answer to our little quiz here. 
[00:27:00]  Fire.  Main.  Coffee.  Penis.  Cup.  Wait, what is penis?  Penis.  Oh, that's from...  The password is...  Wait, start over.  We'll play this on the end.  What show is that?  Nipple.  Cable guy.  The password is...  Nipple. 
[00:27:30]  Can I pass?  Come on.  Stephen, don't be a stick in the mud.  Breast.  Breast.  Pit.  Okay.  Remember his clue?  Heart.  Erection? 
[00:28:00]  No.  Good thanks for noticing.  Your turn.  Center.  Center.  What a dumb game.  Center.  Nipple?  That's it.  You got it.  Come on.  Very well.  George Siegel.  Yeah.  I never saw that movie.  Oh.  Cable guy.  Never saw it.  Poor Matthew Broderick in that movie. 
[00:28:30]  It's probably the best, in my opinion, Jim Carrey movie that he has ever seen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It gets better and better the more you watch it.  And it got slammed when it came out.  Of course.  It so got slammed.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  Anthony, cup is the key.  Cup.  Main.  But fire.  Coffee.  Coffee.  Cup.  But you'll find a cup in every coffee shop.  So why would I be like, cup is good in this case, as far as a clue goes?  Cup.  Cup.  Coffee. 
[00:29:00]  Cup.  Focus on cup.  Cup.  Cup.  Cup.  Coffee.  Mm-hmm.  Ah?  Ah?  Cup.  Bra cup.  Ah?  The tit place.  Ah?  Yes.  Topless coffee shop in Maine.  Give yourself a mail.  Topless coffee shop in Maine is no more. 
[00:29:30]  Well, too hot to handle.  Probably.  Jokes about cup size came grinding to a halt Wednesday.  Grinding.  Get it?  After a fire destroyed a controversial topless cafe in a residential neighborhood in Maine,  fire investigators believe it was intentionally set.  No shit.  Brr.  The old hags in the neighborhood did not appreciate the topless coffee shop.  Nah.  You think it was that, or the guy was losing money and decided the old, they called it  the Jewish lightning.  How the fuck does a topless coffee shop not make money? 
[00:30:00]  True.  Explain that one.  In Maine.  Yeah.  When a fire is discovered at one in the morning, eh.  Yeah.  Eh, man.  Eh.  Eh.  Yeah.  For all you arsonists out there, do it during the day.  No one was in the building.  Right.  Nothing was there that could have caught on fire.  Right, exactly.  And...  Do it while there's a lot of people around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It makes it a little more confusing for everybody.  Dummies.  Officials aren't saying how or where the fire started.  Owner Donald Crabtree. 
[00:30:30]  Miss Crabtree.  How could you have the last name Crabtree if you run a topless coffee shop?  Uh, and six others in the building escaped unharmed.  I guess this place fucking is rocking at 1 a.m.  Six people are in there.  They're drinking coffee.  They're up all night.  True.  Crabtree said he lost his home and business in the fire and that he has no insurance.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  So it wasn't him.  How did he do that?  So it wasn't him.  No.  Uh, the shop featured topless waitresses and waiters serving coffee and donuts. 
[00:31:00]  See, they had to have the fucking waiters.  Waiters.  That's the last time we talked about this place.  We've been talking about this place probably off and on for ten years.  And I remember a story came out.  Some kind of discrimination crap.  Yeah.  And they had to hire guys at the topless coffee shop.  Yeah, there's always that gag lawsuit where, you know, Hooters.  The guy goes, I want to be a Hooters guy.  Yeah.  And shows up with the stupid shorts.  Oh, fuck.  And the Hooters shirt.  Do we have to make everything equal and perfect for everyone?  Ugh.  Just let it be. 
[00:31:30]  The fire happened only hours after Crabtree met with town planners to discuss making it  more like a strip club with longer hours and dancing.  Yeah, well.  He had it with the coffee.  He's like, all right, I'm all in now.  Someone didn't like that idea.  Speaking of tits.  Ah.  Dan, did you find that picture?  Oh, no.  I meant to retweet this last night and I didn't.  Somebody sent me a picture.  I guess there's a tennis player, a female tennis player, obviously, who has gigantic tits to 
[00:32:00]  the point where they're getting in the way.  And she's going to have like a breast reduction surgery.  Is she any good or?  Yeah, that's the one.  Oh, no way.  That is not real.  That's the one.  That's not real.  That's the picture.  I'll retweet it.  Opie Radio, you follow me on Twitter.  That can't be real.  It is.  But they look like they're breast implants.  I wonder if she got breast implants and then realized, holy shit, I'm a really good tennis  player.  I got a problem here. 
[00:32:30]  She's, that's an overhand serve.  She's serving the ball.  She's like, how do you explain this, Ann?  She, she's in, she just hit the ball, but her arm is still way up.  Yeah.  And she's sort of sideways and you see nothing but massive cleavage.  The camera shot is right down her cleavage because she's kind of bent to the side.  And I guess the photographer was on the sideline.  But if you serve the ball up, you'll, you'll lean over, you know?  Right.  Her tits are giant. 
[00:33:00]  Is that a great shot?  That, for, for anyone, those are huge tits.  For a tennis player, they're usually, you know, pretty small up top.  I challenge you to come up with a better sports photo than the one we're talking about now.  All right.  Let's see other pictures of her because this is ridiculous.  Yeah, she's, that's her too?  Yeah.  How do they play along at home, Dan?  She's making a funny face, but I can't tell if she's hot.  We're trying to do better with the visual thing.  So we, we, we get you to play along at home.  Her name is Simona Halep. 
[00:33:30]  S-I-M-O-N-A-H-A-L-E-P.  Wow.  Yeah, she's pretty hot, right?  Yeah.  Let me see another photo of her.  She's 17.  Are you kidding me?  She's 17 with those.  So those aren't implants.  Oh, my God.  That's what youth, uh...  That's her cross to bear there.  That's what youth does for you.  Oh, give me a fucking break.  That looks like a joke picture.  No kidding.  That looks like you used Photoshop, distort, and stretched her tits out.  But supposedly she's good. 
[00:34:00]  Is she ranked?  Not that we care, but I guess we care in a way that it's a big-breasted woman that has a problem with her breast,  and she's ranking in the tennis world.  You think Brie Bartle pick up this break?  Oh, God, I hope so.  Epic tit break.  Very bummed no one picked up our cum break yesterday.  Yeah.  Come on.  Let me chime in a little bit.  You guys talk about breasts.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You guys talk about it.  I'll chime in.  I want to help.  And, you know, we don't talk about women's tennis a lot, but there's another story. 
[00:34:30]  One of the tennis players is really getting scolded, and they want her to stop her moaning.  And most of the...  Ah!  But she does it to a point where they're like, look, it is a major distraction.  You've got to calm down your fucking moaning.  We've got to hear that.  And we've heard some good moaning over the years.  Yeah, who was the one that was really...  Monica Salas was the famous one.  But then there were others after her.  I don't know how you could find that, Dan, but there's a quick little video, and it's pretty good.  Because they interview her.  The video is no more than a minute. 
[00:35:00]  If someone's got it, maybe you could, you know, email Danny or...  Dude, how self-conscious...  Or actually help us out in instant feedback.  We'll get it.  Huh?  How self-conscious is she of her tits?  The one we're looking at?  Yeah.  Like, she's out there.  It's just her and someone else with giant tits.  It goes with our bit that we still haven't developed.  Yes.  The girl with the giant tits.  How many...  I know everyone's looking at her.  She's trying to, like, look cool in her tennis outfit.  But everyone's like, holy shit, look at her tits.  I don't care what she's doing with that racket and the stupid net and the ball. 
[00:35:30]  Look at those tits.  Everyone's saying she's 17 years old.  Yeah.  Oh, and there's a video of her playing tennis with those mammoth titties.  Come on.  Mammoth.  Mammoth.  How many uncomfortable hugs did she get?  What?  Fucking commercials.  That's the new internet.  I understand.  Give me a...  Where do I pay?  Yeah.  Just give me a button where I can click on and I pay so I don't have to look at it.  Look at your dumb commercials. 
[00:36:00]  No more commercials.  And they used to just be quick pop-ups.  Now they're just, you know, commercials like you see on TV.  And you get full 30-second spots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Full 30-second spots.  Oh, I know.  They'll go to 60s, I'm sure.  But see, that's the mistake...  I just will never understand.  That's the mistake radio and TV did.  So why is the internet doing the exact same thing?  It's a whole new world out there.  You can make 10 or 15-second commercials and make that the norm.  Yeah.  Don't do the same shit that TV and radio did.  That's why we all went to the internet and other places. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  We were sick of being, you know, bombarded by commercials.  60 and 30s.  There's no reason to have a 60 or 30-second commercial anymore.  That was something that an ad man came up with years and years ago.  It made sense at the time.  And it doesn't make sense.  Hasn't made sense in a very long time.  Is this a legitimate site or no?  You could get your point across in 15 seconds.  Absolutely.  Is this a real site or no?  Yeah, these are...  It's not like a YouTube...  What is this site?  No, it's...  Well, Jimmy. 
[00:37:00]  Every internet...  It's everywhere.  Pretty much every internet site is going the way of the 30-second commercial before you  get your video.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  Is this her playing tennis?  Yeah, this should be...  This should be her.  This better be a good one, Dan.  Ooh.  This better be a good one.  I just stayed solid.  My game stayed solid.  Wait, hang on.  It's...  It can't be her.  ...to play a part of your match today because we want people to hear...  It's this moaning girl.  You'll know when we see her.  ...when you play.  And then also, you have kind of a feisty presence.  I mean, you're not going to be pushed around. 
[00:37:30]  You're not a big person, but you're not going to be pushed around.  This is the one with...  That's the moaning girl.  This is the moaning girl.  Here.  All right.  Take a listen.  Here we go.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  It's Ric Flair playing tennis.  And then you got a warning from the chair about grunting too loud.  Is that right?  Here's what you said.  I played five matches.  Nobody's compliance.  It's the only one.  Do you tell Sheriff Open to keep quiet? 
[00:38:00]  No.  Oh.  Icy.  That's pretty good stuff.  You know, this isn't some junior's thing at a country club in Florida.  I mean, this is the French Open.  Yeah.  You were just in the moment, right?  The French Open.  The French Open.  I love that.  It's really pumped.  That's a blowjob joke.  And of course I wanted to win.  But, you know, I'm not always going to be able to win.  Well, we thank you, Michelle, for coming by and being with us.  And good luck the rest of the way.  I'm sure we'll be talking.  All right.  Whatever.  We should.  It does make a weird sound, though.  But you take out the ball noise. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  And you would be convinced you're listening to two lesbians going at it.  Oh, yeah.  Boo!  All right.  Now we've got to get the mammoth titty player.  Big-titted monster playing tennis.  I want to see that.  I used to love saying tit monster when I was growing up.  That was my thing.  When would you say that?  In what context?  Use it in a sentence.  Oh, my friends, when we thought we were really cool and we barely had hair on our balls,  and we'd see a tit monster just abroad with nice big boobies, I would go, 
[00:39:00]  Look at that tit monster.  What would your friends do?  Please tell me they'd all just walk away silently.  I told you.  I kind of hung out with kind of nerdy dudes, man.  I was sort of the king of the nerds.  Oh, Christ.  Here it is.  Can I just say that I've never seen a tennis video with 1.6 million hits?  Yes!  We're on this up, dude!  Oh, yeah.  Oh, good God.  All right.  Look at that.  Is that her?  Yeah.  Wow.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  Let's see what happens.  Look at her fucking legs and shit.  I'm sure she's wearing one of those sports bras that just, like, push everything down.  I'm trying.  1.6 million views on a tennis video.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  Holy.  Oh, my.  They are bouncing around like crazy.  They're doing exactly what you'd expect them to do.  Yes.  But they're, like, taped down because she's got one of those crazy sports bras on and they're 
[00:40:00]  still moving like that.  You could only tape it.  Oh, my God.  This is like a practice round.  I hope so.  No one wanted to see her play tennis.  Oh, my God.  How long does this video go on for?  A good five minutes.  Nice.  Sit back and enjoy.  This is...  She is so fucking hot.  She really is.  She's wearing, like, a snug orange tank top kind of a...  Oh.  Or a short sleeve shirt.  Yeah.  And little black shorts.  And those are strapped down, my friends. 
[00:40:30]  She's, like, got a nice ass, too, and everything.  Well, nice everything.  She's a tennis player.  She's shapely.  What buxom breasts on her.  Oh, my God.  This lovely Buxonic.  Tennis isn't her only game.  Wow.  She'll serve up two mammalian protuberances.  I think she uses duct tape.  She has to, but they still jiggle.  That's the only thing that would keep them from... 
[00:41:00]  Oh.  They're jiggling so much, and you know these girls would...  ...have the sports bras.  The score is 30, love.  Please welcome Tits McGillicuddy.  Well, when I'm playing the tennis...  ...I could really be myself out on the court.  Oh.  She is fantastic.  Oh, good God.  Yeah, why is no one in this stands...  Where's she playing? 
[00:41:30]  Gayville?  In Holmerton.  Actually, it is a real match, so I guess this was before anyone knew who she was.  Wow.  Look at that.  I don't even know her.  She's fantabulous.  Just picture a girl with big, giant boobies.  She is.  Yeah, you could tell by...  But it doesn't make sense, because usually when a girl has boobs like that, there's something  else going on with her body.  This girl has long, lean legs, a nice ass. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  An extremely athletic body without that dumb muscle tone, and big boobs.  Find any picture of her with less clothes on.  Yeah, why don't we Google it, Joe?  Let's see what else we can do.  Try to find any picture of her.  It's all about...  What's her name?  Simona Halep.  And Danny, very funny.  A tennis video with 1.6 million views.  But a tennis practice video.  It's not even like it's the US Open. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah, it's not even one of those games where it's like, and the final match.  This is amazing.  She's pretty much alone in a building with her tits.  That's it.  I think someone has to say it.  Anna Kornikova, beat it, stupid.  Who?  You've been replaced.  Wow.  We haven't thought about a female tennis player since Anna Kornikova.  Christ almighty.  Jimmy, look at that one.  They are getting pictures of this girl that are ludicrous.  Look at the bra straps she has over her shoulders. 
[00:43:00]  Just out of curiosity, because Anna Kornikova was an okay tennis player.  She never did anything unbelievable in her career.  Is this big-titted tennis player better than Anna Kornikova was?  How good could she be carting those fucking beasts around on her chest?  I looked at her ranking.  It wasn't really so spectacular.  How could it be?  I know.  She wants to harness her tits.  She was in the mid-200s.  All right.  How bittersweet for her if she has to get breast reduction. 
[00:43:30]  How great is it that she's 17?  They're going to get even bigger.  She's got another year of growth.  Oh, my God.  They'll just be fucking out of hand.  She has some weird disease.  They just continue growing for the rest of her life.  But she's just unbelievable at tennis.  They don't know what to do.  They can't do the reduction surgery.  What relative encouraged her to play tennis?  What creep in her life when she was seven or eight years old,  and you started to see tits develop,  she went out there and hit the ball around with a racket.  What's that picture where she's kind of standing there? 
[00:44:00]  While I play with my pud.  Not her?  Is there a worse word for the penis than pud?  Yeah, pud.  You play tennis.  I'm going to work my pud.  I'll coach you.  Is there a worse word for the penis?  Pud.  I think pud is pretty bad.  Pud is the worst.  I totally forgot about the word pud.  Oh, look at that one.  Oh, wow.  God, when she has to die for a ball, look out.  It is amazing how they catch her in mid, like, fucking stroke, 
[00:44:30]  in mid-swing of the racket.  Her tits are doing things.  They're defying gravity.  It's unbelievable, really.  I know it's a used thing, but.  Holy crap.  That's fantastic.  And she's the one that needs the reduction, obviously,  because that story hit the news a couple days ago.  I hope not.  Yeah, let's, what can we do?  She can't get one.  Start a charity or something?  This is, this should be.  A petition or something?  There has to be an injunction.  We have to go to court and get an injunction against her getting a reduction. 
[00:45:00]  It's amazing.  Oh, my God.  Tennis.  Kip says shit about tennis.  Danny, I got to talk to you during the break.  I got an idea.  Oh, boy.  Is that her?  She wouldn't be in lingerie, would she?  No.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  These are just, what is this?  Bigtits.com?  Titmonster.com.  Titmonster.  Is that website taken?  I probably shouldn't have said that on the air.  Oh, I'm sure.  I want Titmonster.com.  Titmonster.  There's no way.  Titmonster.com.  Fuck.  It's taken.  No one's using it, though. 
[00:45:30]  It's my site.  How do you have Titmonster.com and you don't have anything on it?  Fuck.  Would you think you were cool when you said Titmonster when you were growing up?  Oh, absolutely.  I can't even front.  Did you think you were cool?  It was a cool guy thing to say.  Did I tell you what we used to do when we were in crowded places?  No.  It became a thing in my high school.  I'm embarrassed to say that.  My head is itching already.  I had to have told this on the air.  We did something called the E.T.  Oh, how about Tit?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Did you guys do the E.T.?  No, it was in The Wanderers. 
[00:46:00]  Was it?  In the movie The Wanderers.  For real?  Yeah, yeah.  Elbow titting.  And they went elbow titting.  Did I get that from...  Did we...  I guess me and my friends got it from there?  Something from the 50s.  Were you in a gang, Opie?  No.  You were in a little gang.  Oh, good God, no.  Were you in the Cavaliers?  We thought we were so cool, though, when it happened, though.  Oh, God, I need T.  The worst part of your body to touch a breast.  Yeah.  Your elbow?  Yeah.  Is there a worse part on the body to touch a breast?  You might want a spin kicker with your heel.  Yeah.  With your calloused heel.  That might feel a little better than the elbow.  And then these girls with big boobs would get just poked by us idiots. 
[00:46:30]  Poked in the side of their tit with your elbow.  Nice pointy bone.  But we had to make it look like we were just squeezing through.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Would you say, like, tit monster, 12 o'clock?  Oh, yeah.  And then you and the boys would line up for some ETs?  We would do FT's face titting.  We would just pound your face into her breast.  Or DT, do some dick titting.  That's where you throw her down and straddle her and put your dick between her tits and  go, excuse me. 
[00:47:00]  Pardon me.  I fell.  Look, man.  I was just, you know, I developed very slowly.  My pud was, like, you know, not happening until, like, I was a senior in high school.

[00:52:00]  exciting yep see how this pans out not looking good right a lot of times it's a short video  contributions um stink very short very short like 10 seconds is there like a 10 12 something yeah  all right here we go oh okay there there it is sorry this would have been a break so just oh this guy 
[00:52:30]  with a pole whatever what happened what the uh the pole oh no yeah that's really bad  see the the fast regular motion from that one camera angle wasn't that good but that  he's a pole vaulter he vaults over the pole the pole goes underneath uh and catches him right in  the middle of the crotch yeah on the way down god damn that had a hurt it's called banana split on  youtube it's a very short video look for the short version it's like 12 15 seconds something like that 
[00:53:00]  there you go all right can i say what i was doing last night which i am it was really a great movie  could we do it after the break because it might lead to a nice discussion jimmy okay is that cool  yes what a tease yeah let's uh do that a little tease today and also uh i think the next break  features jimmy a lot because hopefully we'll have your contribution to our big uh epic they're calling  it epic epic on breedbart.tv on the front page and everything jimmy and you were terrific in this and 
[00:53:30]  we're isolating your part okay good i want to be the star you're thinking the exact same thing i was  how could you not think it if you had ears you had to think that who is this fucking idiot of all the  days to just be silly jimmy you picked the wrong one but i wasn't even for part of it i really wasn't  i was like just going like what is that like you know just like listening and and i give no excuse  no excuse i just was i was auditory diarrhea you know how we like to come up with uh morning show

[00:54:30]  any less claypool fans in the room i knew danny was gonna raise his hand and he's a huge fan  why the vocals all the same though to be honest i mean they they are kind of the same but uh 
[00:55:00]  you don't hear anybody else really doing anything like that so i don't really mind so much  i love why no one has a big brown beaver we used to play the shit out of that one hit i like i get  out of primus and then rediscover them like every year and a half and i love the fact that i'm able  to do that because i listen to these songs i love them to death i forget about them and i get to like  remember loving them all over again so it's really cool what was their big hit though i don't think  it was winona no they had my name is mud my name is this one was pretty big too jerry was a race car 
[00:55:30]  driver oh yeah jerry sure sure and uh shake hands with beef was sort of that one sort of went somewhere  do you want to lay down with me saying  Tommy the cat was on the south park soundtrack yeah longer than okay yeah that's uh some cool shit  yeah they did a lot of cool stuff sounds like claypool sounds like the strings are hanging  off his base i love that i love that sound though no one else sounds like him no one else plays like  him he's just isn't that like kind of old school bass where they really vibrate like that 
[00:56:00]  he's smacking them smacking them real hard too yeah hey um we're waiting for the audio of jim norton's  contribution to the big uh epic uh tax rant that our show did that brief art picked up on epic  it's taking quite a while to uh i know garner all the uh gems well because eric's got the  phenomena phenomena so he's a little slow right now and for all my uh tit monster fans i did just uh 
[00:56:30]  tweet the uh the tit monster playing tennis video oh well there you go that's you're gonna have some  friends that's what tm means in my little tweet i just did because i i got scared to to type tit monster  i forgot all about that until today look man what do you want from me what do you call uh big  titted women when you were like immature victims yeah nana here comes z rock now 
[00:57:00]  can i what i was watching a movie oh jimmy yes i'm sorry wait what happened on clips uh it was a movie  i loved when i was a boy but it didn't hold up i was surprised that the dialogue didn't hold up  but i was watching uh kiss meets the phantom of the park you never saw that movie 1978 no  with anthony zerby where kiss is playing at a theme park oh no and um they are like this mad 
[00:57:30]  scientist makes i think kiss robots okay look i sort of remember this oh and and i'm just chilling  out and gene is the demon and they talk to each other like there are scenes where if someone one of  our guys could grab a couple of the dialogue off youtube where the kiss the kiss is all sitting in  uh these giant chairs and they address each other by like their by like their characters no they don't  like uh listen cat man cat man look look i can't it's not good i and it's not good and paul 
[00:58:00]  ace and gene peter's dialogue is is dubbed over no way it's not peter talking why it's i don't know  i heard he didn't like it or he didn't he wasn't into acting no one liked it but you got to see  certain that's just them singing of course it is but you got to watch the whole movie was an excuse  so they could show good concert footage yeah because there was no other place to show concert footage 
[00:58:30]  back then i remember this remember that how many movies had that type of thing going on somewhere  i believe this that's okay i think this was a tv movie and um tv movie yeah i think it was kiss  meets the phantom of the park oh no they're oh they're just mysteriously walking through is there  volume you want the volume i have to really framework oh dude you have to of a roller coaster  it's the bottom of a roller coaster this is funky music you should find out where kiss is 
[00:59:00]  delivering dialogue it's really worth why are they doing this i don't know what's the story  they're looking around why is this flaming homo doing anything trying to be tough oh what is this  like a gang i don't know what are the bad guys this is standing under a roller coaster  they're surrounded yeah we have to get clips have we get clips let's get some of when they're all 
[00:59:30]  sitting this this is and there's also one scene where gene breaks through a concession stand  and like is he's the demon oh i thought they were selling kiss stuff without a license  oh look the fight scene where they're fighting the bad guys slow motion and it's obviously oh godly  these special effects aren't very special they sort of what is it oh no they sort of got planet of the  apes guy it's really what now and his robot head fell off oh it's fucking but there's a scene where 
[01:00:00]  gene breaks through the concession stand because he's a monster and uh some asshole on youtube points  out he goes haha does he fall at five minutes and 36 seconds oh and you can see the gene they probably  had one on the set that gene breaks through and you can see like he crashes through it and then he  kind of just like falls through at the very end it's fucking i watched it 30 times last night  i couldn't stop watching it yeah we'll get phantom of the park kiss meets the phantom of the park we'll  get some clips what happened to you i have gotta see you started didn't know each other obviously and 
[01:00:30]  there's an age difference but i was as big a kiss fan as jimmy was growing up really oh yeah bought  everything i vaguely remember this movie now and then like jimmy i discovered black sabbath  and then i was done with kiss and then i went the zeppelin route after that and that's where we kind  of split off musically right but i mean i was hardcore kiss but now i'm like i can't be bothered  by those guys i still enjoy them i mean i still like their i i but i recognize they don't hold up 
[01:01:00]  in certain ways but some of the stuff was very good but they don't uh you know lyrically they're not as  good as a lot of the bands were but i didn't care i still like them i am now obsessed with seeing  this movie it is well you gotta you know you gotta show it in your big theater oh yeah dude i want  oh wait wait it's coming up you'll see the two cops stretch forward a little bit where gene is like  fighting them all the uh park security guys and when he breaks through yeah oh look he's picking  one up by the throat oh they're bad 70s music and gene is not affected no no he's impervious yeah 
[01:01:30]  the two dumb cops looking on with the slow motion uh awful throwing and fight scenes to really bad  oh here he goes look at the demon walking yeah gene simmons walking towards the concession stand  yeah oh he growls oh god i want to see him fall oh my god he falls right over but you can see 
[01:02:00]  it's like he's stepping trip walks to the watch what's what what's even funnier than the the trip  is the fact that the thing is made out of paper styrofoam and it's so obvious he's supposed to  have what humans you know uh superhuman strength but the scene right after this wait until you see  where they're all sitting hold on when they're all sitting in their chairs around the pool addressing 
[01:02:30]  each other by there yeah that's where you got to get eric to grab the uh or somebody to grab the uh  it might be the next keo from um 48 hours yes he's he's the cop or one of the it might be the next  clip danny where uh they're all sitting around the pool if he wasn't dead he would be so embarrassed  yes listen jimmy every phone is lit oh really every phone is lit i thought you were going obscure  on us but these people know what you're talking about they do dan and uh the poconos dan hey guys 
[01:03:00]  hey dan hey jimmy i love you that that movie i've seen it uh back in the early 80s late 70s and  you're right they used to fly around with their boots i'm sorry but we had say it again we had  audio playing sorry hello yeah yeah go ahead i'm sorry yeah they used to fly around with their big  ass boots they used to use those as like jet propulsions it was so freaking douche chili man  and you were right it was a tv movie it was like oh it was just so freaking goofy man 1978 and i 
[01:03:30]  remember when i was a kid i loved it i thought it was great it was uh you you actually were like  i was 10 years old oh this is cool oh dude it ruled no it didn't it did i was 10 years old and it  rolled it was kiss i guess anything to get you away from sucking a dick well who said it was only a  temporary hiatus this didn't go away there's always commercial breaks but if you might want to play it  from here just see if you can get a little bit of the dialogue unless because look at them all sitting 
[01:04:00]  with their robes around the pool and big like life uh lifeguard chairs yeah they're really tall  can you see it yeah oh yeah why are they on those huge chairs they're mysterious they're the kiss  what are they doing that's horrible hold on let me get joe out of the way and then we'll go back to  the how do you do joe hey joe hey hey fellas good morning morning uh so two things about that movie  uh one they had to re-dub all of ace's lines because i guess he was so stoned when they went  back through to editing they couldn't understand anything that he said no dude it was peter 
[01:04:30]  oh sorry it was peter you're right though uh the other thing was is that i think ace's stuntman in  the movie was black really the black guy with kiss makeup on yeah i couldn't find a white guy  how great is that makeup doesn't look as good on on a black guy yeah how do you do that all right  let's say hi to dj in pennsylvania dj hey good morning boys happy birthday jimmy thank you  hey i just saying i remember watching this when i was a kid uh they used to use their weapons i was 
[01:05:00]  like uh or their guitars and stuff as weapons and it had laser beams and shit shooting out of it  oh really screwed there is punch it out boys there is yeah when you there's a couple of moments here  because gene is three of them now there's peter ace and paul sitting on their big chairs  and gene has not arrived yet but he is coming oh is he yes he is well how does he get up on that  big chair i don't think they show him climbing up i just know he goes and why would you have to sit  on such a big chair i don't know it's mysterious no it's stupid the lifeguard look back it kind of 
[01:05:30]  looks stupid uh more on the stunt double thing bill in jersey bill yo what's up boys  did you say did you say what what'd you just say i said happy birthday jimmy thank you thank you  you guys suck jimmy dude you gotta see uh the age really stunt double dude right at that point 
[01:06:00]  where gene simmons falls down it's hysterical it's an obvious black dude man yeah everyone say it's a  black dude wow there you go coach it out all right let's go to the video yeah the big lifeguard  chair it is near the pool with a scurvy crew steaming close behind and i do mean steaming there  they are the cops were approaching yeah after gene's beating i'm sorry to bother you boys uh  we had some trouble at the park last night and uh well everything seems to point to you 
[01:06:30]  points to me you and this whole place you haven't been up front with me nobody has  a little bit what did you expect this this cuts to a by the way this cuts to a uh  uh heart laboratory oh here they go oh here they go oh no oh no i'm douching out he's clean  a pussycat almost this isn't funny here he comes no kidding that's him  gene has arrived gene very ominous 
[01:07:00]  and were you watching this as a kid going wow oh yeah gene's showing up gene's here now though  there's gonna be trouble the demon is here  he's the one all right almost tore my arm off highly improbable not our demon hi carly cut the  clowning if you'd rather deal with the police  now wait a minute no need for that sneed 
[01:07:30]  sneed this dude someone vandalized our park last night uh smashed some of our buildings and injured  a few of our guards well gene they think it was you think  it was him or his twin gene's brother was an only child easy cat man they are serious 
[01:08:00]  and they've got guns this is ridiculous it is ridiculous this guy is dangerous i want him locked  up all right don't don't get excited so let's talk about this privately excuse us  now they walk off to conference and kiss now is still at the on their chairs yeah their thrones  and they're gonna talk now i don't know i think they do let's hope so oh yes they're all leaving kiss  yep yes kiss now is alone they're across the yard talking they don't get many lines do they 
[01:08:30]  there's no time  well paul mysterious shots paul wants to zoom in and hear what they're saying  oh paul's eye shoots out a laser which enables here through his eyes  you did it but the investigation's a stroke he just wants the guy off his back  two of my men have been hurt  he's gay right i don't think so he's gay right no 
[01:09:00]  this guy jeans in jail they have a show tonight and a matinee tomorrow  and they're mine  ah he's turning them in after the show  he's quitting the possibility that we might pull out  he's just plain sweating  clay aiken sounds more manly than yeah paul stanley in this movie  what's wrong with paul stanley in this movie i think he's very good  the acting is not bad okay this is good i know rock and roll is tend to get rowdy 
[01:09:30]  oh yeah but uh all we want is a nice show tonight boys you get some rest  i don't get this movie just handed him a towel you're welcome to wipe off the sweat  on why does gene have an echo on his voice and why does he growl he's a demon  gene didn't do anything but he's not a demon he's a guy with makeup on his face  weird type of person wonder who could have done it  good question cat man 
[01:10:00]  what do you compute space ace  insufficient dad at the moment star child  we'd better look into it  and she just growls what the fuck  she just growls through the whole movie does he talk  i think he talks a little bit  hi melissa  how do you know my name  he's just showing off  a little star power doesn't hurt either  did you find him yet  no and that's why i'm here you're the only ones who've been any help  it must be feeding time for the demon 
[01:10:30]  it's just they are just they are just so the way they are working through that dialogue  is brilliant you couldn't ask someone to act badly and have it come off wow so bad  it's horrid there was better acting in bride of the monster  yes i don't know i think that like what happens is when you have the star child and the demon in space  space ace and cat man yeah easy cat man easy chavis was saying on the trivia on the uh imdb 
[01:11:00]  it says that they didn't uh memorize their lines and every line that they acted was given to them  right there right at the second they had to say it so as they're acting this whole movie out there  they don't even know how it ends because they never read that's how famous they were back then  they didn't have time gene is probably a movie for you guys but you give me the line just before you shoot it  gene is probably the only one that like took it seriously because he actually went on to act after that  did he well yeah i'm saying he liked acting but he did the less talk the least amount of talking 
[01:11:30]  when he probably could have pulled some of that off yeah but he was the demon right oh yeah and he  broke through the concession stand fell down over tripped over styrofoam good news we could go back to  this but uh giddy rock here because he just went through um jimmy oh stealing the show on the tax  rant the tax rant we're gonna get to uh just to clear the phones kevin the trucker i own this movie  on vhs dustin from pa expected to be the greatest movie ever made uh bill and pa movie made me join  the kiss fan club yeah uh charlie rocklin family guy did an episode kiss saves christmas i don't think 
[01:12:00]  i saw that one i heard about it though i'm gonna have to look that one up today did they put an extra  coat of primer under stuntman's makeup uh one of the guys sounds like kenny yeah that's probably paul  and big medallions kiss war held all their powers that's mike and jim oh yeah the talismans oh the  talismans that's what they showed at the end in the last part of that scene there's four of them  in this magical box one's a star one's something demonic and one's a cat thing and one's like a 
[01:12:30]  lightning bolt for ace well space ace by the way compute it's not insufficient data that's really ace's  voice yeah his stupid high-pitched voice insufficient data star man star man eroc if you're just tuning  in the show today breitbart has given us we think a little of we don't know yeah because in the past  breitbart was not kind to this radio show yeah we're on the front page of breitbart today b-r-e-i-t-b-a-r-t 
[01:13:00]  dot tv and basically they're calling one of our breaks in epic epic tax rent epic an epic tax  rent they got the whole segment up on their uh page today that's pretty big for the radio show  and uh jimmy noticed that um no correction everyone noticed anyone with fucking ears and an eardrum  noticed jimmy's participate participation was horrendous it was non-existent it was distracting 
[01:13:30]  and shitty but but for a regular day of radio it's great but the day we're going to be featured  on breitbart you probably want to leave that material at home i've sounded smarter at other  times yes and i kind of noticed this exact same thing last night when i was uh going to breitbart  i texted you oh did you really i i know i texted an about it surprised to hear me i'm like what really  uh eric so so what do you think so far you you went over the tape yeah um there was one or two 
[01:14:00]  times jimmy actually chimed in to participate in the conversation but a lot of times it was jimmy just  going huh what no really so we isolated jimmy yeah this rant is getting a lot of exposure today the big  epic tax rant on breitbart.tv and this is jimmy's part isolated but i actually looked through it  the amount of taxes i pay i went oh that was the rant went on for another three minutes for this 
[01:14:30]  portion of anthony's discussion and that's all jim contributed jim went oh and then jimmy had this  to say or or do or whatever is it over 50 for the most part now for everybody for some people  but it's worse in england too it's bad it's like it's worse over there good for good for them  part of the epic tax rant on an epic tax rant but in england it's worse over there 
[01:15:00]  yeah gives a shit and then there was this from jim norton they don't get we can't keep tabs on our  politicians anymore let's say yes jim i'll tell you what it is just a bunch of muckety mucks  uh really giving it to us down there in washington hitting us right in the pocketbook sure is oh  don't even get a start with what regular joe says i haven't heard from regular joe in a while thank  god since they got us by the purse string they sure do day late the dollar short that's what i always 
[01:15:30]  say oh regular joe regular joe but if you're a fan of the show funny obviously you know what that is  but this is being exposed to a lot of people that have never heard our show before  yeah now a bunch of people tune and go why is that guy saying who is that asshole yeah why is he  using old cliches yeah what is that guy saying he's a fool who is that boob a monthly per line 
[01:16:00]  surcharge paid by the customer to recover local companies contribution to the federal universal  service fund what i don't know good good add-on what don't what he had to talk more than this no  no it's a fee assessed to the privilege for the privilege of using the municipal public right of  way what does that mean typical good contribution jim because that's what the radio audience is 
[01:16:30]  wondering so be their voice you should be in kiss meets the phantom of the park with your dialogue  i really should be kiss meets the douchebag of the park and it's me i'm at the park telecommunication  relay service hearing impaired telecommunication device for the deaf tax i don't talk to any deaf  people exactly i don't even look at them that i'm proud of that i am proud of yeah you should  be there's nothing wrong with this there's everything wrong with it that's the only thing 
[01:17:00]  that was worth playing there's that line i don't talk to deaf people i don't even look at them fair  enough she went and got a nickelback ticket why you would see nickelback that's that's your own  issue but whatever she went and got a ticket shitty band tax yeah too bad you don't even get a  nickelback oh regular joe i think that was bombing jim more than regular joe that was uh i don't know  what that was it was uh it was regular joe that was everything out of his i don't know what it was 
[01:17:30]  oh it feels good to laugh  easy tit monster  you watched kiss meets the phantom of the park and liked it loved loved loved i loved it sort of

It's kind of hard to, I think it's kind of hard to be given a line and then repeat it.  One more time.  My pal, Little Jimmy Norton.  Okay.  Hello there.  This is Smokey and Joe Frazier, and you're listening to Little Jimmy Norton, Joe. 
[01:25:00]  Perfect.  Okay, thank you, man.  You nailed it.  Thanks, Joe.  A lot of people said that he sounded like Tippi Tom.  Yeah, a little bit.  That came in a lot.  Frazier sounded like our old pal Tippi Tom.  We love Joe Frazier.  I thought he was funny.  Steve there.  All right, you nailed it.  Yeah, Steve can't be bothered.  Why would you keep him in there for another 20 minutes when he babbles like that?  I'd have him doing fucking promos for every show.  Right, until his freaking voice box shut down.  I'd be making up shows. 
[01:25:30]  I would go out for lunch for the guy.  Just stay in here.  Insufficient data, Ant-Man.  I'm so douchey.  It's not.  Yes, it is.  Oh, Travis has some other doozies?  All right, Travis has some more Opie and Anthony ID doozies.  Not the good ones.  The good ones are boring.  I don't even give a shit if some celebrity says their names in an ID, to be honest with you.  What does it really mean? 
[01:26:00]  Because they don't really care.  The ones that are great are the ones that you fuck up, like this one.  I don't even know which one Travis is going to play.  Go ahead, Travis.  Hi, this is Louis Guzman, and you're listening to my pal, Little Joey Norton.  No, Louis.  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Right on.  Who was that?  Louis Guzman.  He was in Boogie Nights.  Oh, right, right, right.  He was a nice guy.  He was a great character actor.  Yeah, kind of a slow interview, but he was a nice dude.  Yeah.  You got another one?  Hey, yo, what's up?  Yo, it's the kid 50 Cent.  You're now listening to my pal, Little Johnny Newton. 
[01:26:30]  Neutron.  No.  Norton?  Little Jimmy Neutron.  No.  Johnny.  Jimmy Neutron's the thing, right?  Norton.  What up?  It's the kid 50 Cent.  You're now tuned into the sounds of me and my man, Jimmy Norton.  J-J-J-J-J-J-Unit.  What the hell was that?  He was saying J-Unit, but he called me Jimmy Neutron.  Jimmy, little Jimmy, what did he say first?  Johnny Neutron or?  Little Johnny Newman. 
[01:27:00]  Johnny Newton.  Little Johnny Newton.  He was in a Huey P. Newton.  We got another one, Travis?  Huey P. Newton.  I don't know if we have another one.  Okay, O.P. and Anthony.  Yeah, of course.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you are listening to O.P. and Anthony.  This is the Superfly Jimmy Snooker, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Superfly Jimmy Snooker on your radio doll. 
[01:27:30]  On your radio doll.  Oh, we had some winners.  Any others there, Travis?  The last one I have is Iron Sheik.  Yeah, well, you got it with Iron Sheik, sure.  This is Iron Sheik, World Wrestling Federation three-time champion, All-American AAU champion.  A pleasure for me today, Anthony and O.P.  Bring me here to New York.  I say hello to all my wrestling fans, and everybody know I'm the real Middle Eastern man. 
[01:28:00]  Come to the greatest wrestling country and most famous city in the world, Manhattan, Madison Square Garden.  I come three-time champion.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially All-American, and also my Iranian friend.  I want to say hello to all my wrestling fans, especially all Americans, and also my Iranian friend. 
[01:28:30]  Pleasure for me to come back here again one more time to talk to the O.P. and Anthony, and pleasure for me always.  With my 10-inch cock.  He's exhausting.  Now, we got the picture blown up of him peeing himself and me pointing, and everyone in the picture is just unbelievable.  What happened?  Is SiriusXM going to, like, you know...  No.  They're not going to fucking do the right thing and pay for it to be framed nice for us?  To frame.  E-Rock, can I have a copy of that photo, the big one, with us, please? 
[01:29:00]  E-Rock got it blown up, and, you know, we want SiriusXM to fucking put in a nice frame for us and put it in the studio.  I just want...  I don't want anything from SiriusXM.  Will they do something nice for us that doesn't involve looking at a contract?  I just want...  Jesus Christ.  ...the big copy for myself.  Oh, you want to hang that?  A big copy of the file myself.  I'll pay for it myself.  I'll have it blown up myself.  I want nothing from it.  I want a huge one to put it over my fireplace.  Right.  That would be great. 
[01:29:30]  That would actually be good.  That's a great shot.  Conversation piece.  Sure.  Do one nice thing for us.  Who's pissing on the fire?  Unbelievable.  Hey, Rob Allen Philly.  Heard you guys talking about the tennis player with the big boobies.  Just read this when I got to work.  She is due to have the breast reduction surgery.  We were talking about this.  Oh, geez.  Later this year.  Tennis players undergo breast reduction.  Damn it.  Simona Hillup has been taking the junior tennis circuit by storm. 
[01:30:00]  Now, this is what I want to do.  That's terrible.  I'm too lazy.  I don't feel like doing it.  Someone out there, if you do a good job, will promote the shit out of it.  We've got to start a website immediately begging her not to get a breast reduction.  Yes.  And we'll put her best pictures up there.  Maybe have a petition.  All sorts of shit.  Yeah.  Someone do the leg work and we'll promote it if it comes out nice.  But someone start the website begging that she does not get the breast reduction surgery.  What kind of doctor would do this, first of all? 
[01:30:30]  It's like spray painting over the Mona Lisa.  That's nice.  Where'd you go to get that done?  Sam's Club.  Sam's Club.  Let me see.  What's wrong with getting something blown up at Sam's Club, Jimmy?  I told him to go to Dugal.  That's wonderful.  This isn't yours.  I know that, but if it was going to go...  Is that for you?  That's a high and hearty fuck you he just gave you, Jimmy.  That's right.  But if it was for the studio...  No, no, no.  I know if it's for the studio, what I was saying is you should have gotten a real high quality  gloss photo done at Dugal. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Why is that woman in the background?  They should probably black that woman out in the back.  You could probably Photoshop that.  There's a woman on TV in the back.  It's Tyra.  And you could leave her in there.  It's actually pretty funny.  We finally learned to turn off the TVs when we're doing stuff in studio.  Yeah, that could be taken out.  You don't need her in that.  You can work that a little bit.  E-Rock, are they going to frame this for us?  We asked.  They haven't said anything.  He almost fell.  That would have been so fucking good.  He fell and ripped it up. 
[01:31:30]  Why would that have been funny?  The problem with these guys, they never say anything.  They just don't say anything.  And we followed up on it, and they said, we're looking into it.  Why ask them for anything?  Let's just...  We know what the answer is.  And that should be...  Like, I'm looking at it.  Why would you help us out?  It should be color corrected a little bit.  Like, the contrast should be brought up so you can see the piss a little better.  Yeah, it's just got to be...  That's a horrible copy.  Of course it is!  Dougal on 23rd Street.  I'm not stumping for them.  It's the best photo place in the city. 
[01:32:00]  Tell them to frame that fucker, and we'll give them a free plug.  I'm not against Plugola, that's for sure.  Let's bring back that Plugola shit.  I don't think you should say it.  Yeah?  That's what I say.  Plugola, Payola, whatever, man.  All the olas.  Johnny-ola.  Start sending your brown packages.  I don't give a shit.  I'll promote your business.  I pay for everything there.  I don't mind it.  I really don't.  I don't care, because I fucking hang this stuff in my home.  My home, young man.  And it looks good.  Because they do a good job.  Sam's Club.  That's great.  What'd you buy, isn't it, a fucking 500-pack of Snickers and Mars bars? 
[01:32:30]  Fucking hope we got the flu at Sam's Club.  Hey, CokeLogic's got the name of our website to save the tennis player from getting a breast  reduction surgery.  Should I say this?  Because someone's going to grab it.  No, let Danny get it first.  Danny, can you get it?  Because I have a suggestion, too.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Danny, bye.  If I say it, will you have enough time?  Probably not.  Just write it down first.  Write it down.  Let them buy it.  And then we can say it. 
[01:33:00]  Right.  CokeLogic.  And it is Idea Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Jared in Boston, CokeLogic needs to animate the Iron Sheik ID with the wet spots slowly  growing bigger and bigger.  That would be good.  CokeLogic, you do that.  We'll promote that one, too, for you.  And people are suggesting that we Google bomb something about Simona Halep today, but  something that they would go with.  Yeah.  Because someone has a good one, but it has the word tit in it.  I don't think Google's going to appreciate the number one Google trying to tit in it. 
[01:33:30]  It's all right.  You can still do it.  Fuck Google.  Yeah, I don't think they'll like that, right?  Yeah, but we're creative.  Simona Halep, keep your tits is being suggested, but I think we could do a little better.  But keepyourboobs.com is what I was actually suggesting for their site.  Yeah?  No good?  Well, CokeLogic has...  Do you want me to write it first, Dan?  I saw it.  Okay.  Can I say it now?  Nope.  I love this website name. 
[01:34:00]  I love it.  If you've been listening since six, you can probably figure it out.  Oh, boy.  Wait a minute.  No, because that's got...  Well...  Here, I wrote that in.  Oh, the camera.  Oh, wait.  Is that it, right?  Huh?  That's what you want?  Danny owns it.  Well, not yet, not yet, not yet.  Oh.  I gotta buy it.  Well, fucking buy it.  Let's go.  Danny, buy it!  Buy it?  What are you doing?  What's the matter with you?  Hurry.  Hurry! 
[01:34:30]  GoDaddy wants to know if I want the .info, the .tv, the .gg.  No!  Yes, get them all!  No, just go with the...  I mean, no.  Yeah, .com is good enough.  You don't need them all?  No, of course you don't.  Easy, Starchild.  Feeding time for the demon.  Grrr.  Ugh.  On their big, stupid chairs.  Oh, look at Brooke Hogan is on the pics.  Oh, we got a little backstage with her.  I don't know.  We can play it, I guess. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, we got it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  We can play that after the break.  We can do Kenny's morning mashup demo.  Remember that?  Remember when?  Fantabulous.  John Sterling.  Bad one?  Failed.  Horrible call.  They're all horrible calls he does.  No, but this one is...  Is it epic?  This one is...  Is it epic?  It's epic fail.  Epic fail.  I like that.  Are we going to see a cat playing a fucking...  The piano?  Yes, that should have been.  That should have been keyboard cat at the end of this.  Keyboard cat, right?  Keyboard cat. 
[01:35:30]  Sometimes I don't understand why these things become big.  Keyboard cat, why?  I don't know.  The oddest things.  I am now in possession of said domain.  All right.  Coke Logic came up with it.  Basically, the website's going to be called SaveTheTitMonster.com.  We own SaveTheTitMonster.com.  So if we got a web designer that can really do all the heavy lifting...  That was 819 Well-Sped.  Yes. 
[01:36:00]  We'll hand over SaveTheTitMonster.com.  We'll hand it over to you, and it is to save the tit monster.  Simona Halep, who's going to get breast reduction surgery.  She's 17 with huge boobies.  Tennis schminus, I say.  That's right.  I think we're on to something.  I really do.  Yeah.  Yeah, we definitely do not want her getting reduction.  They are beautiful.  We need a nice web design for this.  Showing her in all her glory and just begging not to go under the knife. 
[01:36:30]  And you know why?  There doesn't seem to be enough pictures of her yet with those things just released from  the sports bra.  How do they look?  How do they hang?  They're natural.  So they got to...  Do you know what that must be like?  Dude.  Come on.  Right?  Someone else is suggesting.  This is someone who's got a picture over here.  Please keep the big titties.com. 
[01:37:00]  How about keep the balls bouncing.com?  Oh, my God.  Just a close-up of that down the cleavage shot is just terrific.  Those tits...  Dude, have you looked underneath her armpit there?  Yeah.  Because the sports bra is pushing it.  I told you, man.  Oh, God.  You know, these sports bras, I curse them.  When women were brave enough to work out alongside men, they had nothing to keep everything close 
[01:37:30]  to their body.  So it was amazing to watch women work out.  Everything was jumping around and jiggling.  Now they got these sports bras.  Because they don't look feminine whatsoever.  Everything's strapped down.  Look at under the tit.  It's like...  It's pushed.  Yeah.  It's wonderful.  She's got three...  Like...  She's got three things holding her tits in.  Mm-hmm.  One of them looks like a lanyard just in case they snapped.  It doesn't hurt the crowd. 
[01:38:00]  It's like a safety bungee.  Now, if you didn't know any better...  Yeah.  I would lose so much money saying those have to be breast implants.  I know.  Right?  You know why?  Because the way she's moving, those things are...  They look like just round...  Yeah.  Yeah.  ...under the skin.  Like...  They almost look like a bad boob job from that angle.  That's because she's moving and leaning over and playing tennis.  But just naturally... 
[01:38:30]  Imagine at night when she just crosses those arms in front of herself, grabs the bottom of  that shirt and lifts it over her head and they just go, ka-chung, ka-chung, ka-chung.  In front of the window?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  While you're walking your dog?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  How fucking beautiful.  Is that the best?  Oh, fantastic.  What happened?  What'd you do?  Who said that?  What?  Where were you peeking?  What happened?  Take a peek?  Sneak peek?  Is there anything better than walking around your neighborhood and all of a sudden you're  like, wow. 
[01:39:00]  Getting the sneak.  Without having to climb into trees and stuff, okay?  Yeah.  I'm talking about I'm on the sidewalk walking by.  Yeah.  I'm not hurting nobody.  That's right.  You ever see someone fall like when EMS is tending to them and a tit pops out?  Maybe an older woman just taking a tumble.  That's bittersweet.  Why do you always have to make it creepy?  It's creepy about that.  I was keeping it nice and like kind of hot and sexy.  You know, you're walking your dog and some woman doesn't realize that, you know. 
[01:39:30]  You're walking your dog and he stops and he's circling and as he's shitting, you're looking  at your tits in a window.  Right.  Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the section.  All right.  That does sound sexy.  Yeah.  Break time.  We got a lot to do, so.  Maybe the old gal has fallen off the curb and maybe she's giving herself a compound  fracture of the shin.  And as they're tending to her, her breast falls out and is laying in the, uh, in that  fucking garbage juice water that goes along the thing.  In the gutter. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  And maybe you go over there and give her nipple a little tweak.  As she's screaming in pain.  As milky.  Setting in the leg.  As milky gray fluid is running over it from the street.  Garbage juice.  You go over and give her a nip, a tweak, and cheer her up.  That's disgusting.  I'll look at David Patterson being interviewed.  She's actually, the woman's actually holding up a newspaper.  What is she doing?  She's showing him the newspaper.  He's blind, madam.  He can't see it.  If you hit him with it, he wouldn't even know what it was. 
[01:40:30]  Say, what was that?  Was it a bad mitten racket or?  It's a newspaper.  What is that?  I've heard of them.  What are they used for?  Is there a burden here that's going to duty?  What are you doing with the newspaper?  Does he look silly?  Yeah.  Yeah, his approval rating isn't that good.  How could it be?  He's taxing everything.  He's a fucking typical tax and spend guy.  How can it be?  Too late with the tax thing, Jimmy.  That's all I have.  You blew it.  Yeah, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  I want to start a new rant.  Yeah?  Taxes?  What are we, bunch of fucking dick suckers? 
[01:41:00]  Make Brie Park.  Did our calm discussion make it anywhere yet?  It should have.  Yeah.  This internet is very fast.  I think I'm too as plain as...  And then I was just laughing to myself last night, thinking about, like, if, you know,  how quick my living room with Phil would come.  Yeah, yeah, you have to stop.  I stopped.  How many people were thinking that?  I was looking at a few rooms going, eh, that's...  You know what?  How long would it take?  And now you could kind of...  You have a basic thing to go off of, so you could kind of figure it out now. 
[01:41:30]  You're like, eh, it's...  Would you have time to escape your living room from, from, from the calm?  If all of a sudden God decided, okay, all loads will, will empty in your living room.  In your living room.  Would you have enough time to get out?  Could you get out?  How many seconds would you have?  I don't know.  There's a couple of small bathrooms that I'd have a problem with.  Living room, not so much.  What if you try to hide in the bathroom as your living room is filling up with cum and 
[01:42:00]  then the stuff's coming under the door?  Yes.  Like the blob?  You got to put the towel under there.  Turn the air conditioner on, really?  How would you defend yourself from, from just a mountain of cum?  A mountain of cum.  That is just taking over your, your, your, your, uh, compound.  You'd be standing on the toilet at one point, just going, oh no.  Trying to lap it up.  It's kind of...  What else are you going to do?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You have to lap it up, spit it out flush. 
[01:42:30]  It's like a physical challenge.  Lydia wants to talk about Kiss.  Why?  Maybe after the break.  But when we come back, can we discuss, too, this plane crash?  How horrifying.  Oh.  Why?  New details.  Why make everyone scared out there?  Everyone's a little scared.  It's what happened.  Yeah.  It's a horrible story.  Terrifying.  It's terrible.  All right.  We'll do that and some other things.  Thanks.  Travis, take it. 
[01:43:00]  That Sleewa drop drives me batty every time I hear it.  Bat shit.  Opie and dopey.  Yeah, are we?  Clever.  Knock that beret right off your fucking head, Sleewa.  Well.  Jack off.  What?  What?  I'm saying it's been shot off his head.  Whatever.  Stupid fucking cab windows.  Fucking Sleewa.  Brooke Hogan's on TV.  Yeah.  She looks gigantic on TV. 
[01:43:30]  You know.  She's a big girl.  But we had her in studio yesterday.  I think she looks smaller on TV.  She's just six inches tall.  Oh.  But in studio, she looks unbelievable.  And then you put her on TV and she looks giant.  Yeah.  And I was telling Anthony she's aging in dog years.  Like she's 20, 21 right now.  Yeah.  By 25, you will.  When she's 25, you will never admit to anyone you ever thought she was hot.  But she is going to age quickly.  Yeah.  Quickly. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know.  She's got youth on her side right now.  She's beautiful.  She smells good.  She was very cool.  I'm living in the moment.  I'm trying not to be a dick because we had her in yesterday.  You're trying not to be a pud?  A pud.  Because she was really, really nice.  But the fact is, she's going to be, how is she going to keep the weight off and stay  in shape?  And you know what I mean?  Is that the cover of her album?  She's got like angel wings and airbrushed ribs.  Where's little Nicky? 
[01:44:30]  Where's little Nicky?  Backstage with Brooke.  Oh, we can do this.  Good segue.  Oh.  She was in yesterday.  And sorry, I'm trashing her today.  I shouldn't do that because she was definitely cool.  We asked her about the Iron Sheik because we forgot to on our show.  Iron Sheik wants to do all sorts of things.  To Hulk Hogan.  To Hulkster.  And you know, so we asked Brooke about it.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts. 
[01:45:00]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts.  And not too long ago, pro wrestler the Iron Sheik stopped by the Opie and Anthony Show.  And started talking crazy about Hulk Hogan and his family.  You don't like Hulk Hogan there, Iron?  All right.  How do I love today?  The man, he put the baby oil on top of her daughter's boss.  Oh, right.  Or he have sex with his daughter's girlfriend.  What kind of fucking man he is trying to... 
[01:45:30]  His wife is...  His wife, she's a gold digger.  I'm trying to fuck that hell, bitch.  Because she needed 10, 11 cock to fuck on fucking bitch pussy.  The incontinent Iranian grappler was talking mad trash on the Hogans.  Hulk's daughter, Brooke, was in studio recently.  And we found her in the hallway and asked her if she was going to let the Iron Sheik get away with this type of smack talk.  All right.  We're here with Brooke.  Recently on the show, the Iron Sheik was on. 
[01:46:00]  Mm-hmm.  And he started going crazy.  He was talking about Hulk Hogan, your dad.  He was talking about your mom.  He was questioning Hulk's sexual orientation and calling your mom names.  Do you think he's still a relevant force in pro wrestling?  Not even close.  I don't even think I remember the last time he wrestled or was out there.  He said that he could break Hulk Hogan's back.  Do you think there's any possibility of that going on?  Given the fact that he's like 20 years older than my dad, I don't think that's possible. 
[01:46:30]  Brooke is talking wild shit.  It's obvious these two are both ready to throw down.  With remarks like that, the Hogan family, Iron Sheik beef won't be squashed anytime soon.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been Backstage with ONA.  Primetime Sam Roberts is an asshole.  I love it.  This is terrible.  Whoa.  Yeah, he's all like, ooh, trying to make a big thing of it, a big brawl. 
[01:47:00]  Let's say hi to Virginia and North Carolina.  Virginia.  Hello?  Hi.  But Virginia's not in North Carolina.  No, I'm from Charlie Long Island.  That's why I got a little confused.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah, what, Virginia?  I am dating this new guy for maybe a week. 
[01:47:30]  I met him on Sunday.  Since then, I have had to play him Jimmy Norton's little story the other day about how water makes one invisible,  and explain the game of monster to him.  And yesterday, I had to, had to, had to play this clip of how much cum would it take to fill up the room.  He looked at me and said, you listen to this, thought I was a little crazy, and then said, I have to get X out.  Oh, nice.  Hey, look at that.  Turning people on to our show by having a little cum discussion. 
[01:48:00]  Yes.  This is what I want everyone to do out there, literally everyone.  The weekend is almost here, right?  You're going to be around people socializing at a bar or whatnot.  Maybe go to the beach or the park or what, or maybe a sporting event.  But just, just have the discussion.  Bring it up.  Bring it up.  Like, picture a room that you all are familiar with and how long it would take for that room to fill with cum.  Bring grandma into the discussion.  Grandma.  And don't go stupid with one guy, you know, just masturbating over.  Yeah, yeah.  That's dumb.  The world population cumming, or the guys, you know, at the same time, how long would it take for your room to be just filled to the tippy top with cum? 
[01:48:30]  Filled to the brim.  And then, you know, call us Monday with how it went, how your little discussion went.  I am going to go see my grandmother tomorrow, too, so I will.  Would she get into that conversation, something like that?  What?  Would she get into a conversation like that?  My grandmother probably would.  She's a little insane, so she probably wouldn't fully understand what I'm talking about. 
[01:49:00]  All right, well.  Get into the conversation.  If you want to talk grandmas, there's another thing I have thought of.  Uh-oh.  You know, you look at older women walking the streets of your fine city, very old at the end of their lives, you know they've taken a lot of cock over the years.  A lot of cock.  And I've decided, well, I've pictured this one, too.  So you lay the old broad in the tub, and then God magically gets all the cum that Grandma was involved with, and you see how filled up the bathtub would be. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, wow.  She's getting out of it like the shining.  After the discussion yesterday, I thought about how many loads does the average woman swallow?  Well, see.  It depends on her religion.  See, Virginia, you're on to it, man.  I mean, think the old broads and how much cum in their lifetime, and then you magically have it reappear in the bathtub while she's laying in it naked. 
[01:50:00]  She's a good egg, this one.  Yeah, she really is.  Would you be surprised, like, you know, your grandma's like, oh, my God, it's overflowing the sides.  How many loads have you taken?  What the fuck were you up to, Grandma?  Who wants to picture their grandmother with the hand-mouth motion, smelling her own breath on the fucking cock and getting, like, a breath smell on her hand?  Once again, Jimmy taking the sexiness out of my bitch.  But who wants to picture Nana doing that when she's in her mid-40s, and her fucking, her, your drunken grandfather has sweaty, smelly balls from the office all day, and she's got a fucking... 
[01:50:30]  It's time for her to perform her duties.  Yeah.  And he's like, just jiggle them, just jiggle them.  And Grandma, with the charm bracelet, has to reach under and squeeze his fucking, knead his ball bag.  With the charm that stands for you.  Yeah, a charm for...  You know, a little grandmother's charm bracelet.  A charm for every grandkid she has.  Jingling around.  Jingling and jangling.  Virginia, thank you.  Jingling and jangling.  Thank you. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  Let me say hi to Ziggy in D.C.  Ziggy?  Imagine your grandma naked in a room filling with cum.  Nigga, lugga.  Oh, I thought maybe he was coming down the hallway.  No, I can't even, like, continue the show until he appears to work.  I know, I'm...  I'm not happy.  Tim in Jersey.  Tim?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Yeah.  I was thinking of the scenario of how many, well, gay guys or how many women it would take 
[01:51:30]  to fight off the flow with straws.  Yeah, all right.  We're back to the cum discussion.  Now you're in a living room.  Let's just...  Everyone can relate to a living room.  It's filling up with cum because all the guys in the world are coming at the same time.  Now what do you do?  Or, I mean, they don't even have to come at the same time.  Just natural shit.  Right now, guys are coming all over the fucking place.  Of course they are.  So now all those guys that are coming, that is now filling up your living room.  And you've got a defense for this? 
[01:52:00]  No, I'm saying if...  How long...  How long would it...  You know, how many, you know, women, gay guys, whatever it might be, it would take to  stem the flow of it, to fight off the flow?  If it was creeping under the bathroom door?  Hmm.  I don't know.  Too speculative.  Too many variables there.  You want to move on from our...  You want to move on?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't really...  Sorry, guys.  Yes, you are.  Tom in Michigan, Tom. 
[01:52:30]  It hurt Tom.  I lost Tom.  All right.  Kenny, you were going to the mic.  What happened?  You got something?  I just want to say it was good timing when you were talking about filling up the room  with cum with the out-cue guys walking by.  They really got a kick on that.  And you made somebody very happy.  Oh, really?  That's what we tried to do.  Yeah.  We aimed to please.  Right for the face.  Did he just say that?  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he said.  Now there's probably a whole discussion of how straight guys talking about cum is weird. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, Kenny, you're here.  You want to do the morning mashup demo thing?  Oh, I want to hear this.  People are dying to hear that.  So, Kenny's trying to, like, get a spot on one of these channels at SiriusXM.  Yep.  Notice the XM is getting smaller and smaller on all the fucking...  I know.  On all the little logos.  Oh, my God.  Just get it over with.  And there's the little doggy.  They show the doggy, and then it's pretty much shitting on the XM. 
[01:53:30]  Is that subliminal?  Yeah.  And the XM is already in parentheses.  Parentheses.  I just think XM is a better name.  Of course, it looks better.  AM, FM, XM.  It works.  Yeah.  But, you know, they don't want to see past that.  Because, I don't know.  Now it's an ego thing.  You think that's what it comes down to?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Kenny tried out for what so far?  The classic disco or classic dance?  The strobe.  The strobe.  The strobe. 
[01:54:00]  And he did a little country demo?  The highway.  The highway.  The highway.  That didn't work out too well.  They kind of showed you the old highway, didn't they, Ken?  Oh.  They don't know talent when they hear it.  So now you're trying out for the morning mashup.  Yeah.  I fit and go with them.  With Nicole.  Rich.  Rich.  Ryan.  Ryan.  And Stanley T.  And Stanley T.  And you had them cracking up.  What happened?  They walked by, and they were laughing uncontrollably and pointing.  And it looked like they were pointing at you.  He was trying to bring up a serious point. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Maybe they were looking at his sneaker boot shoes.  He's got them off today.  Let me see.  Sneaker boot shoes.  Of course they do.  Look at those fucking, what are those things?  Look how worn out they are on the bottom.  Giant fake leather fucking canoes.  You gumshoe.  Yeah, they really are.  He has a gumshoe.  They're comfortable when you're running around all day.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Right?  How about when you're lumbering?  Oh, I got to hustle.  How about when you lurk, lumber, and make others uncomfortable? 
[01:55:00]  When you're being sloth-like.  Oh, those fucking big, awful, soft-bottom shoes.  They're giant, too.  Terrible.  Just everything he has is huge.  How many perps saw the bottom of those shoes, Kenny?  Size 13.  Wow.  13.  Yeah.  Do you go to the big and tall?  The freak shop?  Yeah.  You have to shop there, though?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But it's cool, because you're like a cartoon character.  You pretty much wear the same stuff all the time.  Yeah, I got an image.  Yeah, you got your little jacket, your suit jacket and everything. 
[01:55:30]  You dress sharp and everything, but, you know, you're like Fred Flintstone.  It's the same clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just different colors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you pay extra for the big clothes?  Does it...  Is that like you're going to the big and tall store?  The freak store, as you call it?  Yeah, that's how they get you.  Yeah, you got to pay, right?  What is it, Rochester or something?  Casual, male, big and tall. 
[01:56:00]  Kind of limits what you can get, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  I love interviewing Kenny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wait for the sales, too.  You know why.  Because I'm a Joe.  He's a Joe.  He's a Joe.  Kenny's morning mashup demo.  So now he's trying out for the morning mashup.  We played this one yesterday, but we'll play it again just to get this thing going. 
[01:56:30]  Psychedelic.  Hey, it's me, Crazy Kenny, king of the morning mashup.  I want to start off by kissing Kid Kelly's ass.  He's the boss of the mashup.  So I want to dedicate a song to all you metrosexuals out there.  Here's the Jonas Brothers with Paranoid.  I make the most of all the stress.  It's too loud.  Okay.  I'll turn it over.  That was done very well, though, Kenny.  Yeah, not bad.  Yeah.  No, I got a good producer. 
[01:57:00]  I don't think you fit in here.  Primetime Sam Roberts.  And my board op is the greatest, Troy Kwan.  Troy loves this show.  Troy Kwan.  Is he winning the Howard battle over there?  They're battling it out every morning.  It's the strangest thing.  Troy cranks up our show.  The other dude cranks up Howard's show.  Yeah.  They can't listen to either show because it's being drowned out.  The other guy's got his shoes and socks off all the time.  Why?  He had tattoos on his toes.  Real macho. 
[01:57:30]  Why does he got tattoos on his toes?  I don't know.  Who's winning the see-through shirt war?  Jesus, Danny.  Troy?  But Troy's winning the see-through shirt battle.  He got ink.  Who's got ink?  Troy.  Troy Kwan.  But he doesn't have ink on his toes.  No, because that's silly.  It's stupid.  It is silly.  Yeah.  What kind of tattoos does the guy have on his toes?  It says, like, death metal or something.  I was told.  What, each toe is a letter? 
[01:58:00]  I guess.  Yeah, I went.  That seems a little.  All right, back to Kenny's morning mashup demo.  I have one.  Sticks.  Yo, everybody.  I'm Crazy Kenny, king of the morning mashup on XM 20 on 20 and Serious Hits 1.  And speaking of hits, what do you say to a woman with two black eyes?  Nothing.  She's already been spoken to twice.  Well, play that fat cow song. 
[01:58:30]  Here's Kelly Clarkson, and I don't hook up on the morning mashup.  Wow.  Man.  Huh?  That was good.  Is that the kind of content they're looking for over there?  Yeah.  A little wacky zaniness and blatant insults?  Oh, they're very edgy.  They're dark, right?  Yeah, they're new wave.  Yeah.  Huh?  You know, they like to wake people up in the morning.  Apparently so.  Anthony, a lot of people saying that the show got really gay with our cum discussion. 
[01:59:00]  Yeah.  And we really can't argue that point, right?  No, not really.  So, um, Bird from Buffalo wants to help us out.  And you know that whole cum discussion?  How long would it take your living room to fill up with cum?  To fill up with cum, sure.  Uh, Bird from Buffalo suggests that we change it to how long to fill the room full of period  blood.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, okay.  See, think of the flowing that's going on right now as we speak in the world. 
[01:59:30]  That's got to be a lot because...  Let's change it up a little bit.  It comes, uh, through the chimney.  All right.  It's coming out your fireplace.  Right.  The shining elevator.  Uh, wow.  See, no clue.  So, how much is released?  Well, the quantity is a lot more than, uh, a cum shot.  So, you're getting the quantity there, but it only happens once a month with the women.  A lot of girls on their, uh, period right now. 
[02:00:00]  Man, that room would fill up quickly.  Quickly.  Back to Kenny's morning mashup demo.  I'm Crazy Kenny, king of the mashup, and I want to read a listener email.  Jessica from New Rock City wrote, I love you on the mashup, and I'm a single lady, so  I'd like to know, what do you like in a woman?  My penis!  I'll call you later.  Here's Jamie Foxx with Blamin' on the Rohifinol.

[02:11:30]  gonna lose another listener uh let's go to heather and pa heather oh morning boy hey hi got some  tampon info for you tampon so if you look on the box girls sometimes wear the slim regular or the  almighty dildo size super plush but you determine the size that you need based upon the amount of  ounces that you produce and say a six hour period but how do you how do you know well you basically 
[02:12:00]  got to try it out like i just try the sims and that works good for me and sometimes if you like  the tampon i guess too quickly then you know you need to go one size up so then you need to go  like the regular which could be like up to like four to six ounces and the super super plus six  ounces yeah it's a lot of blood heather you got a big cunt uh no actually i got a little one 
[02:12:30]  oh jeez it's very cute oh by the way oh love muscle milk drink it every day oh all right look at  that i'm getting ready to drink some chocolate muscle yeah that's the kind i drink i drink the  light though i drink the light version well all of it's light it's chocolate milk without the  goodness man it's like that it's like that bacon chocolate that you used to think was tasty until  you're baking chocolate whatever you just said bacon chocolate i'm like bacon sounds like it would be  flavorful and disgusting damn it now i'm thinking about bacon again erock's running down the hallway to 
[02:13:00]  find out where to get it i curse you now because now all i'm thinking about is bacon salt  fuck bacon thanks heather you know what an elephant all right you know what an elephant uses as a tampon  what kenny a sheep  you should come out of a fucking multi-colored door and say that joke  the new laughing with kenny i always wanted you guys to remake that show  i think it would be perfect a variety and anthony's laughing yeah instead of ronin martin starring 
[02:13:30]  kenny though we should do it as a goof can we set it up somehow get a fake wall with doors that we  popped out of and do like some of this vaudeville crap and they're not going to pay to frame a  picture they're going to pay for a fake doors disappearing floors and a set we need a set something  with hinges on we need a riser god damn it danny you're right exactly i asked for these guys i  asked for a piece of gray construction paper they took out of my pay jesus get it i get it 
[02:14:00]  wasn't that bad sure it was it was along with the theme of them not giving us anything no do you  want to know how many periods it takes to fill the room up well you know what people are getting  really pissed with the come and the period thing but i guarantee it's one of those things that people  will be discussing the next few days with their friends have to i have a fluid joke coming up in my  hollywood 411 report thank god bring it right around right kenny yeah all right let's uh get the 
[02:14:30]  answer danny well if we remember what was the what was the uh the uh question i believe the question  was how much how many periods would it take like how many chicks's periods would it take to fill up  this very studio uh-huh that wasn't it living room chimney i thought we're doing the same cum equation  from oh we changed it a little bit well living room and chimney i mean various sizes of living  rooms right yeah so we need a benchmark to work with i just like the visual that the period uh 
[02:15:00]  fucking blood was coming through the chimney this is now this studio is the benchmark and that way  you can then say all right my room is about twice the size of this so can we at least have a fake  chimney so then i'm happy to yeah and a fireplace where the period absolutely blood is fine period  blood is now coming out of the chimney yeah but there's a lot of variables here like how much air  has hit the period blood is it chunky because the viscosity is going to depend on whether or not  dude i'm not even going to listen to you until i read this feedback and then i swear i'll shut the 
[02:15:30]  fuck up comes these in period blood what's next liquid yeah i could do that you can do the liquid  diarrhea equation i guess it's all just volume isn't it look i'm even turning my mic off i can't  well folks if we remember yesterday uh the size of the cubic footage of our studio  is i think uh it's two thousand uh forty square uh cubic feet from what i remember so uh based on 
[02:16:00]  those numbers uh i could bore you with the math if you want to go through it there's 30 milliliters  in an ounce there's 128 ounces in a gallon 27 20 gallons in a cute uh i'm sorry uh  no i got it here don't worry i don't know what you tripped up yeah i did uh one cubic foot is uh  seven and a half gallons we remember that from yesterday so you do the math and it comes out to a grand  total of two million two hundred and thirty eight thousand one hundred and seventy one women's 
[02:16:30]  periods two million so i figured two and a quarter million two and a quarter million this room to  fill up this room but they're doing it at the same time oh god would that just be  i'm just i'm getting a visual who would be the last one out of the studio  swimming through the clots that's when it gets to the door all right this is so  disgusting you could probably just grab on oh oh what i'm i'm the only one that uh had the word 
[02:17:00]  clot pop in my brain when this discussion started one like uh leo in the titanic yeah  i probably feel like like thin membranes cocoons they probably feel like swimming through jellyfish  i'm not even gonna think of what other senses would yeah i was just gonna say i don't want to think of  what other senses would be just appalled make this discussion so fucked up that no one is listening 
[02:17:30]  that no one's listening we mean how about we what do you think they're tuning in to catch the end of  this i i can't get out of the car until i find out how many gallons have come it would take to fill a  cowboy's hat i'm dying to know how much corner of the mouth spittle it would take to fill work boots so  that that was the rich loss uh is it a 10 gallon hat equation that someone came up with believe me  as i said it i realized i was answering my own question how many gallons have come i just said  how many loads dan very good i'm a fool work on the liquid diarrhea one all right as uh we play the 
[02:18:00]  best part of kenny's morning mashup demo the morning mashup does something called the 4-1-1 what's  that uh ken helping for a self-inflicted gunshot wound music playing that's like nicole's  but she does like the entertainment current events the gossip all right so so you'd think you could  you know i i fit right in do a much better job with that right of course all right here we go  kenny's hollywood 4-1-1  and now it's time for the entertainment 4-1-1 on serious hits one and xm 20 on 20 with me crazy 
[02:18:30]  kenny the king of the mashup susan boyle lost the english american idol you know why she always wears  long dresses because if she wore a short skirt her balls would stick out i hope she likes to drink  because god invented alcohol so ugly people could fuck it's one rumor has it bruno is hooking up with 
[02:19:00]  adam lambert i can't wait to see pictures of their shit-stained cocks after they bump uglies  hey that reminds me do you know why semen and urine are different colors so those people know if  they're coming or going and that also reminds me what's the difference between anal sex and a  microwave a microwave won't brown your meat john and kate plus eight are all over the news i hope  you're breaking up because i'd like to finger bang kate she'd start complaining oh your ring hurts i'd say 
[02:19:30]  honey honey that's not my ring that's my wrist watch you know because after eight kids she's got a big  cunt i'm crazy kenny that's the entertainment 4-1-1 on the mashup serious hits one xm 20 on 20 let's mash  it up you got the 4-1-1 get it 11 minutes past unless we're running late the sound of generation  now serious exam hits one you change your mind holy shit listen yeah we're all thinking the same 
[02:20:00]  thing who you wouldn't listen to that you just got a feature on our show my friend yeah i i kenny's  4-1-1 taking the name and everything club soda kenny's 4-1-1 yeah we already got what the haps  no what's that not what the haps what the haps never caught on let's be honest we already have  what's your hat yeah i think sam would even agree it never caught on so no oh oh you're in the room 
[02:20:30]  hi sam i didn't see him would you allow kenny to do the club soda kenny 4-1-1 you still got the  backstage thing what's the haps has nothing to do with the 4-1-1 what's the haps is going out on  the street and finding out what's the haps the entertainment 4-1-1 is just finding out what's  going on in entertainment i think right i think this would be a good gig for kenny kenny you got  to do that okay i do what i'm told there's nothing that we could do that is going to be better than 
[02:21:00]  that last two minutes that was uh that was special right there you know pop culture my friend it's  obvious yeah and you got a nice little unique little twist on it yeah oh yeah that's slightly  different than entertainment tonight and you know why access hollywood and your presentation  is much like those entertainment shows and 4-1-1 you know the info things like that the production  but um your colorful language is what distinguished it from those other reports uh kenny yeah i must say 
[02:21:30]  i was very entertained i know it was a lot to take in maybe you want to play it again giant  cunt was it i don't know let's take a listen we will play it we will definitely play it again  before we get out of here you kidding me you got yourself a fucking segment on our show my friend  that's what that's what i say no no more money though we can't pay you okay you got to do it you  know for free all right he'll do it show is appalling today keep it up um ricky m from massachusetts uh 
[02:22:00]  best bit ever kenny thank you already calling it best bit ever uh jersey matt bayonne i love kenny  close to kenny now with even less class than before i listen every day and someone wants to  do a booger discussion with this room oh boy all right now you're out right now now i might have to uh  i might i might have to tap and you know what we could we could we could get the sexes together in  this one because girls are picking their nose too they just don't do it in front of us  other so how many guys and girls would take their nose oh yeah they do how many guys and girls would 
[02:22:30]  it take to fill this room up with snot i just got the heebie-jeebies i could go through the way  just picture the jizz the fucking period blood and now snot but this one's great because how many  people would it take you know i'm in if it's just if it's you and that chick that was here i'd give  you both the fucking nod what do you mean that chick i think i'm in a car i'm in a car flamenca 
[02:23:00]  flamenca whatever she's got she's got three more great stories it was awful about hers i could see  under the fucking the way her fucking finger was working under the flesh of the nose that was a  really experienced she was digging her fucking finger she put it on my arm man my friend watching  her dig up her nose oh you could see the way her finger has navigated that route thousands of times  it was like watching a mouse running a cheese at the end of a maze left right left right straight 
[02:23:30]  left right left the cheese fucking knew the inside of that schnoz could we do the snot discussion so  the whole world as far as the whole world goes right now there are a lot of people picking their  nose at this very moment yeah so you take all those people magically and now they're like lined up to  come into the studio and then wipe the booger on the wall how long would it take for this room to be  just before the walls just come well that's what that's my visual i was thinking everyone  understands their freezer and how how there's less and less space if you if you don't defrost right 
[02:24:00]  that's how the room would be with snot until the walls are now touching and you'd have to  you'd have to uh you're wiping it on other snot now oh yeah yeah and then you'd work your way toward  the door yeah until you are the last guy close and if you opened it it would just be a flat wall  of boogers oh let me think and i love the real mathematicians out there people are pissed dan 
[02:24:30]  they're like danny's numbers are way off are you way off they're way off  oh he's sticking by his numbers he's typing away he's figuring out the tell me well if said person would  like to call in and tell me how my numbers are all right if i'd love to love to explain his name  is steve all right he's from texas steve hey and first off talk to haters you guys can make cum  and blood in a room funny we will now we're talking about snot yeah snot we're gonna make hot snot just 
[02:25:00]  wiping it on the walls and then now you're wiping it on other people's snot until this whole room is  filled with snot are we going liquid liquid or like crusty jimmy uh i think any snot is good it's  all about it's all about mass yeah so we'll take any snot steve why is danny's numbers off all right  well the the period numbers that woman said that it was four to six ounces yeah but she's wrong nobody  bleeds five ounce and on average five ounces of blood per period that's ridiculous well that's what the 
[02:25:30]  woman said of the five shots yeah can you imagine five shot glasses of period blood oozing out of your  wife's vagina every month that is disgusting they don't make a tampon to soak up that much juice it  is over a week yeah you have to put a comforter in a box we're only we're only interested in the  women with the heavy flows we're only doing heavy flow women i'm so disgusted the type of women that if 
[02:26:00]  they didn't sit up that time of the month it would look like a jelly donut got stepped on  i said we're going all in with this disgusting here talk and disgusting the audience today yeah  we're all in average blood loss during menstruation let me go find it i don't want average i want the  heavy flow race menstruation how many heavy flow days does women get uh three it all depends three out  of the seven that's why we got to go with an average here and then average blood loss during the girls 
[02:26:30]  that are only spotting no interest in you yeah we want girls with the heavy anorexic girls not on  a pill lose their period good point uh what is the average it says here average blood loss is 35  milliliters with 10 to 80 milliliters considered normal don't give us that commie fucking metric  shit i want to know in ounces 50 milliliters say well 30 put it in something i could wrap my mind  around 30 milliliters is one ounce so if 35 milliliters is the average so you're looking at a hair over 
[02:27:00]  an ounce okay so it's just about a shot per weight per day or the entire period that's the entire  period cycle just the shot think about how i mean that's a lot of blood you throw an ounce of blood on  the floor oh god damn it jimmy i just did the shot glass motion like tipping it back  imagine having a full if like you'd smell it before you taste it it would taste like a tomato  juice stronger if someone could guarantee that there's no diseases to be caught i would i would 
[02:27:30]  take one for the team with that i would wow i would try it you know a little hair caught in the back  of your throat oh no oh let me tell you how stupid the opiate anthony show is you don't need to  everyone knows right today is a day where we're being featured on breitbart for our epic tax  rant that's true probably got a lot of so we got a lot of new people going wow i gotta check these  guys out all right you're right finally they're talking intelligent about taxes and this is what  they're hearing today and i have an answer to the shitting question how many mouthfuls dan go hold 
[02:28:00]  on dan just because i don't want to lose another great phone call hold on uh surgeon canada surge  how come i couldn't be this good at math in school  hey buddy wait wait what'd you say  uh i i fucked up at the beginning no you didn't fuck up but you you said what to jimmy  oh happy birthday thank you thank you all dear friends  go ahead search sorry uh how many boogers would it take to put in your mouth before you can't say 
[02:28:30]  fluffy bunny or a chubby bunny oh chubby bunny fluffy bunny yeah chubby bunny yeah if you did  the chubby bunny with just snot yeah but that gets away from the the basic equation that we've  been using you are so right too that people are probably listening probably like conservatives too  that are going like oh i want to check out these guys tax we had a really good chance to pick up a  lot of yeah yeah today like oh you know okay well uh these guys are against obama so uh that's 
[02:29:00]  good maybe i'll give them a listen and oh dear oh dear oh no epic period blood chat yes  is that gonna be posted i suggest we rewrite the textbooks my friends you want kids to do well  at math yeah there's something they would be never this interested in cubic footage yeah thank you  how do they play it in the textbook with the cubic footage crap oh it's always just a room and some 
[02:29:30]  kind of gas in the room and i don't know all right maybe that was german textbooks yeah well okay true  a lot of you read as i well i'm i'm i am leafing through some new photos you know what's  fucked up there are people for real that want to know how many gallons  uh would it take to fill up this room so they could discuss this at home  we had that number yesterday yeah we did i think i have the number it's 20 this room 
[02:30:00]  our studio here is 20 400 gallons so using that number you can you could figure out all sorts of  stuff yeah that could fit even the snot thing probably yeah rough i mean i guess we can measure  like the average the average snot the average discharge per like my my my pinky goes all the  way up to the first knuckle in my nose so we could figure it out from there my nose is itching now just  thinking about this go ahead dan what do we got well we've moved on to people shitting and the question 
[02:30:30]  was how much how much liquid shit could you use the word diarrhea there are kids listening how much  diarrhea could fill us with that matter now according to statistics i've found yes all this  a healthy person will produce 10 and a half ounces of of waste material three times a day  wow so that comes out to 31 and a half ounces per day which is roughly one quart let's just call it 
[02:31:00]  a quart even though a quart's 32 ounces there's four quarts and a gallon and like we said there's  twenty thousand four hundred gallons i could fill this room okay so you do the math and that would  be eighty one thousand and six hundred people taking a shit to fill this room one shit only eighty  one thousand it would be technically it would that number you might have to times it by three because  i'm taking the total the total waste per day daily total daily waste material eighty one thousand  eighty one eighty one point six thousand now we're getting down to a number we can kind of 
[02:31:30]  yeah we can grasp that now we're talking stadium numbers so imagine uh stadium imagine football  stadium if everyone enjoying stadium took a shit it could fill this room instantly pretty much  are we getting paul abdul steve maybe we just wanted to open the door did you hear the break  i'm gonna go pay let her listen to this jimmy oh jimmy's bladder dude i can't i've been 
[02:32:00]  paid jimmy yeah go pee go make weewees i'll be back go make weewees come on come on go make  weewees all right why don't we all take a break thanks a lot jimmy we could do some more math  poor jimmy explode it's a lot of poo yeah jimmy's got a little hummingbird bladder for for everyone that  uh heard about us uh on breedbart.tv we're gonna do something intelligent next oh no we're not  why would we why would we do you want kenny's hollywood four one one as a regular feature on the 
[02:32:30]  show absolutely has to be it's fantastic we're trying to figure out how to work the pop culture  thing and then i think we got it that's it it's perfect right every oh my god he is uh he is gold  you see how he just waved at us i know now he's a big star big star kenny they're calling you a big  star be a big star here comes kenny again doing the 4-1-1 are we getting paul abdul i see a discussion  going on outside yeah we're working on it yeah she's gonna come in oh i don't think so 
[02:33:00]  now you know with talk like that sir i don't think we'll get her she does know that they brought in the  the other judge because you know yeah it's called a transition period oh oh yeah why why did they  what did they need four judges like why out with the old in with the new they had a perfect setup where  with three you could have two people uh decide uh opposite decisions and then you got the tiebreaker 
[02:33:30]  so long pill popper we don't need you anymore i don't think we're gonna get her with this type of  talk really there she is kenny open the door paul abdul everyone  could we just go to break 
[02:34:00]  who's this fat slob  guy just walking down the fucking hallway  holy angry  i'm not even angry that's the  i know it's it's fun not to be angry that's the beauty of this you could really just start insulting 
[02:34:30]  people you make fun of this one all right oh my god you do this fucking geek where'd you get that  shirt out of the hamper a rat  oh what a dumpy look like a slap a slouchy  oh look at this what a fucking mess look at this fucking mess 
[02:35:00]  hey look oh  that's family from america of course it is do you get excited when you when you uh spot one of  the mashup guys there kenny yeah but why why why are they separated  you might have thrown a wrench into the works over there  yeah you might have shaken things up probably thinking god we could have you know the likes of  a club soda kenny get rid of one of the guys does liam own another shirt yes for real he owns a lot 
[02:35:30]  of shoes really yeah he wears two different shoes every day i think he wears the same shirt every  day oh he wears different shoes every every day two different shoes never the same oh really that's  that's pretty cool it's a style yeah you know our intern man knew you were talking about him oh  he's watching and he says they're talking about me in there aren't they  no no they're not who wrote kenny's material kenny writes all his own material you wrote that kenny 
[02:36:00]  me and sam collaborate i have i have to give sam credit you want to you want to give sam a little  time in your uh hollywood 411 then no you think you can handle that once a week yeah yeah yeah  it's a big spot on the show kenny yeah no there's a lot of entertainment doesn't want to share the  spotlight we'll do it until you fail miserably yeah which shouldn't be long at all exactly no  we get so excited then we burn this shit out so quickly all the time one trick jackass yeah 
[02:36:30]  i mean let's keep in mind this is from the writer of the original kosher sports  and that was a runaway hit so remember that with david remember david  intern david you know david david who jewish kid remember what happened to him  i don't know what day does he come in that was the guy that brushed his teeth with dog  shit no that was a different different guy david he was jewish and he was white oh no okay  the big boy made a duty no that was creed by jones that was no no no no david was like he was 
[02:37:00]  very jewish and he did kosher sports and uh he went to a yankee cranky and what happened to david  for real he doesn't want to come back he's supposed to visit us might maybe he is soon  really a little surprised maybe oh oh are we trying to get that booking maybe he'll be back  very soon and they say he's not doing any press maybe he's ready to do some press very soon yeah  jimby you see uh paul abdul out there i have not no she's in uh i think she's in our queue 
[02:37:30]  really well don't they have to bring her by here no no that's why that's probably going to show up  and mash up around the other way why do you think they gave us the studio they really did think about  they did because would you bring her by here if you would everyone can avoid us if they have to  yeah this this can be avoided except for like little nicky i think little nicky can't avoid us  no he's he he doesn't mind he's in he's not avoiding us that means he's probably sick today 
[02:38:00]  yeah could someone play the part of little nicky today because we just love doing that bit  get one of the dumb interns to brush their hair silly okay and walk down that walk down the hall  but don't tell him why yeah okay okay and then he runs off we give the dumbest request  could you have somebody brush their hair like little nicky and walk down the hallway okay right on it oh my  god on it can i just say that i for the very for the first time in probably three months i actually 
[02:38:30]  attempted to brush my hair yesterday wow i can't tell you i think i lost like a half a pound of hair  it was absolutely brutality you know you should use ants desert eagle you're right i should wait but  if you're uh if you're not combing hair why hasn't it done that like jamaican thing uh dreads yeah the  dreads thing dude to be honest sometimes like because my hair is naturally curly sometimes they get like  dead and like i have to really work at you break them apart yeah do you ever because i know when i 
[02:39:00]  had uh longer hair uh it was much like danny's hair and uh you'd get a knot in it and then just rip it  apart yeah and you'd hear like oh you'd hear this tearing noise it sounds like like snapping a piece of  celery in it oh no here comes fat little nicky it's huge nicky  here comes little piggy gigantic nick hey wait look wait wait what the  fuck what happened there goes hold on the real little nicky walked by as we were making believe

[02:48:30]  uh wow he wasn't lying oh that is an epic fail  a-bomb for the japanese guy oh  yeah that's a bad one and then he didn't know what to do it's an a-bomb  want to hear that again yes  sayonara kid after that mistake  it would have been if alex had hit it 
[02:49:00]  i wouldn't say sayonara kid after that mistake  it would have been if alex had hit it  it would have been if alex had hit it  the sayonara kid hit it  i wouldn't say sayonara kid after that mistake sayonara that's what you get  you fucking idiot he had a great home run call  he had a great one yeah which was uh you know it is high it is far it was dramatic 
[02:49:30]  hadeki matsui hit it and then he has to go into his uh  his stupid shtick and wreck it and he tripped up why'd you have to do that john he had a great  home run call if he just did that hadeki matsui i would enjoy listening to him again but  uh no he had to he had to  is it no it wasn't the sayonara kid what is that 
[02:50:00]  you i guess you know the ball goes goodbye  it's when he hits it god damn it what  it's fine it must not be anything ugly i don't want any meetings  they're probably going to get they're probably going to get uh  let's hold trust me it's like a secret service coming down the hallway  that's all it is no it's nothing or something people argue at work it happens yeah it's not a big deal  yeah please throw it is over all right yeah that's a that's he's actually okay he's the 
[02:50:30]  he's the guy he's like the head of security oh bruce rolls oh you know okay yeah bruce is  you know i mean he doesn't look like he'll be a nice guy either bruce he looks very unpleasant yeah  but he's a nice guy i would say we get along with just a lot of people around here a lot of people the  the only problems we've had here have been if shots have been taken and responding to shots that  were taken like that guy who used to be in this studio nobody here fucked with him he bashed the 
[02:51:00]  show so the show hit back oh alex bennett yeah i remember his name but yeah that's the finger  yesterday yeah but it's like dude you can't bash the show and then expect us to not bash you  back every time you walk by the studio how can you not expect that right guys sorry just reading  about the uh flight 447 that's horrendous dude oh horrendous they're speculating it was a high  altitude wing stall they slowed down a whole bunch um because they were in heavy turbulence and they 
[02:51:30]  slowed down a little too much pulled back too much 100 mile an hour updrafts from wind yeah and uh they  could figure this out already that's what they're speculating by looking at the radar and and the info  they do have and the wreckage and the type of wreckage the fuel spill in the water instead of it you  know it didn't burn off so there wasn't there's speculating there wasn't an explosion that the thing  uh stalled at 35 000 feet which is hard to recover um from in thin air up there uh even at in good air 
[02:52:00]  you know when it's still but they were in the middle of a thunderstorm  oof so the thing just kind of started falling and broke apart because it will a plane will break  apart if it falls air egypt they said that happened too because the the resistance will rip the wings  off there's too much uh planes have their um you know maximum speed and then then you got to uh look 
[02:52:30]  out because they start coming apart and they're telling pilots now these uh airbus uh aircraft similar  ones uh uh to watch their speed and attitude and stuff when they're they're uh cutting back on  the power at altitude can you imagine the horror of that because you think like the last we all had  turbulence and you think that turbulence is whatever they planes are built to take it yeah but to  actually have a plane now and again this might just be air francis spin on it because it's in their 
[02:53:00]  interest to have it not be a mechanical failure yeah um so if there's facts that are kind of ambiguous  like yeah we don't know they're gonna push towards it was completely weather related it was a lightning  strike right they have to they're dummies if they don't yeah yeah but the black box may reveal that  there was some sort of catastrophic failure which was plane oriented if they can ever find those damn  things they're pretty low down there and i think what do they last 30 days the beep goes beeping for 30 
[02:53:30]  days yeah they'll within they'll have like two weeks to search two and a half weeks they'll be fine  and then uh how do they how do they retrieve that an automatic uh uh motorized down right  it yeah or no nine thousand uh what was nine to ten nine thousand feet now the same 12 000 feet  oh so that's uh over two miles 12 000 feet of water and they would have to uh get a submersible  jimmy's getting a picture with paul abdul i think is that what he's doing he's walking over like a ghoul 
[02:54:00]  dude what a stalker is he's stalking yeah is she is she receptive okay he'll probably get a picture  he'll probably get a picture yeah he'll probably get a picture cool yeah he's been he's been his head's  been spinning around he's looking for her in the hallway i don't want to miss my shot  i gotta gotta get a picture with paul abdul have people calmed down over there yet  there's heavy talks going on in the corner which corner with right there so those guys were here for 
[02:54:30]  us what are they saying with mr carlisi and mr uh club soda who else and then the security guys  oh it's not like uh yeah no it was ugly yeah it was ugly and you would have been trust me you  would have been right in there i'm sure that phony bullshit look if you want to talk off air and 
[02:55:00]  settle some things no problem but i ain't listening to that phony bullshit anymore  the old fake hellos and the nice nice ride and then then it's reported back to you like with you  you know within an hour that there's a good trashing going on it's like i was just in the  elevator with you  you're trashing me you get to pick i did she smells really good how's she look in person right  she look i don't know she looks actually honestly she looked really good really yeah she looks really 
[02:55:30]  good let me see your picture well they only approved one photo and poor iraq was standing there by  himself with no you didn't get a paul abdul picture for iraq did iraq get one  oh he put he let iraq stand there with him you have to of course i did the photo you of course  i did why would you do that he's a real fan i can't look at look at jimmy trying to be real cool  like you could i mean uh iraq being real cool about it no i had to he's it's like it's because 
[02:56:00]  i you know i it's much more important to iraq than it is to me photoshop iraq out i'd like to  just put an elephant's head on there yeah but iraq has gotten me some cool that's okay i don't  care if he's in it that's fine yes girl i can just uh but boy he really is a lot closer to her  than i am well he's a lumbering picture ruiner he is he uh he really likes her oh here's a here's a  good one too because she was putting her purse down all right so here's me and paul looking at  the ground i just cropped me right out ah there you go the first shot paula was putting her purse 
[02:56:30]  down so there you go there's me and paul it looks like a candid shot like you two just hanging out  yeah like we're looking at the floor like what's that and i'm like oh those are the mirrors on my  shoes that old gag  funeral home story oh it sounds like a real picker-upper this show took a bit of a turn  huh yeah sorry about that i was just trying to take a leak man there we go 
[02:57:00]  and yeah we do take shots and our shots were way better than yours by the way if you really want to  the want to know the truth this south carolina funeral home has been forced to shut down after  its director admitted one of his employees cut the legs of a corpse without the family's permission  he was a man that was full of love james heinz was a minister who died of skin cancer in 2004  this funeral home handled the burial for heinz six foot seven frame according to the measurement on the 
[02:57:30]  casket and the funeral director we asked him but this suitable for his length and he said yeah  that'd be perfect the home's director said employees never told heinz family that his body might not fit  in a standard casket but when rumors started to spread authorities opened an investigation and exhumed  his body last april and found that heinz legs had been cut to fit oh man i have a feeling this happens a 
[02:58:00]  lot i bet it does they just don't tell the families oh so the shoes just look too close to  the knees and they don't want to say like why are the shoes so close to the knees they're kind of  crooked i guarantee well how did they well how did they find out huh how did they find that out  they uh did they say it in that part of the story where they um had to exhume oh they did exhume  the creepiest thing to do out there is just to exhume the body now was it because somebody had spilt 
[02:58:30]  the beans there i i did i miss something in that story look i'm in another world right now what  can i tell you what do you want from me i want to know how they knew you want to play the clip over  again you have to but i have no clue how they found out dan who was listening there was um oh actually to  the clip to put their body was they buried a guy and his legs were right yeah um you know all right  for real because he died i will raise my hand i definitely wasn't listening i wasn't either i partially 
[02:59:00]  listening because what do you know i know that the guy um uh died like in 2004 i think they said  so now that's four five years later how did how did they find out within that five years that they'd  cut his legs off they exhumed but why did they exhume the body apparently uh oh danny might not  info on this were you listening well yeah i mean i pulled the story but uh there was rumors apparently 
[02:59:30]  there was rumors that that had been going on there i guess i think one of the workers had admitted to it  uh that they cut so yeah so nobody quite was sure if it was the truth or if this guy was just talking  shit and uh so i guess the investigation ended with and uh and even though i didn't say that  zoom exhumation exhumation no no no no when it's when it's uh exhumation what it's exhum or exhumation 
[03:00:00]  exhumation it is exclamation but it's not ex whom it's exhum or to exhume the body or the  exhumation shut up you're a liar it's funny but it's true no it's exhumation no not exhumation  it's exhum or not it's not exhumation it's exclamation or exhume i will never say it like  that okay i wouldn't either it's an awkward way to say but that is the proper way to say it exclamation  let's play another i don't know what to believe with him you know i have good grammar that's one 
[03:00:30]  thing in life i have jimmy has bad blood results good grammar fantastic i was voted boy most likely  to not fuck up grammatically look at his eyes do that explanation again uh it's exhume is to remove  but it's not exhumation it's exclamation exhumation would sound it sounds like an exclamation point  in a way it does sound like that it's exclamation the eyes always give it away i don't believe it  what i don't believe it it's not that it's not that big a deal but if you say exhumation you 
[03:01:00]  you know i'll sound silly yeah right i'll try not never to use the word ever again anymore exclamation  oh no  what exclamation no not exclamation exclamation  i can never say it right to you why you're always criticizing i'm not though i'm trying to help  you we're on the radio but you know there's got to be millions and millions of new listeners i don't  care you sounded brilliant and brief all right now all of a sudden you want to start saying the  wrong words i don't think anyone would have known that i said it wrong eggs who benedict 
[03:01:30]  gun answer on by the way i lied uh about saying it it's exhumation  really yes he's very good hey uh working on my acting gary in florida knows you know why they found  out that the feet were cut off oh let's say hi to gary in florida gary hello yeah well during the  service uh they family kind of noticed that the left foot was on the right leg and the right foot  was on the left leg see oh because hold on i give you this oh it feels good to laugh 
[03:02:00]  all right uh is there anything wrong with the cutting off of someone's legs i mean i understand  look the family ain't gonna like it but if no one finds out yeah and you just like who who really  cares if they do it to fit you on a plane because you're going on vacation right there's a problem 
[03:02:30]  exclamation and wouldn't it make sense actually for the funeral home no danny to try to sell the  family a larger uh larger casket yeah maybe they were gonna maybe it was the deal breaker though  maybe maybe they said i could go to the funeral home down the street and they're going to give me  you know better deal do you think they kept trying to make the guy feel cut like they tried kept trying  to fit it like they probably took his legs they crossed it like he had his one leg crossed over  and like that doesn't look right it doesn't you know they probably tried to fit him in before they  hacked the leg they didn't instantly measure and just go they probably tried pushing his head down 
[03:03:00]  they crammed his head against the fucking top and his feet but the the middle of them would buckle  up like trying to put like they're trying to sit him indian style on the casket  all right yeah bend his feet at the right angle okay a lot of listeners saying they didn't listen  either oh really so we're gonna we're gonna play the clip again all right focus okay let's focus on  something in the room to get our focus good i'm not i'm i'm gonna just like look into my hands all  right focus this south carolina funeral home has been forced to shut down why don't we at least 
[03:03:30]  get her in here one of him where is she i just wanted to see if people would get distracted oh  she's really right out there no oh i'm acting again his employees cut the legs of a corpse  without the family's permission he was a man that was full of love james yeah but he's dead so he's not  full of anything anymore exactly except formaldehyde he's full of stuffing and how does having no legs 
[03:04:00]  make you not able to love it i'd love to hug you but my legs are gone i have no love for you  bitch who are you but i love you die bitch get cancer in your face i have no legs  they didn't they didn't cut off the feet by the way they cut off the legs  what are they gonna do a big part of the legs supposedly the guy was six seven they cut him down  a five foot five no way come on come on stop it that's a midget casket oh i hope the family would  have i hope that part was in the story uh glenn oh no flint uh sorry yeah you're talking to me 
[03:04:30]  it's not it's not that they cut him to five foot five but when the guy's the size of lurch and they  fit him in a casket as big as al pacino he's gonna think something's in it and they're gonna exhume him  thank you oh all right i think what they should have done is knocked knocked two holes in the  bottom of the coffin and stuck his legs out like he's a fucking spongebob square pants  stick his feet out the spongebob square cadaver as the pallbearers are carrying you just see his feet 
[03:05:00]  dragging on the ground big fucking lanky douche it'd be like a basketball player sleeping on a kid's bed  his feet hanging off george in alabama george hey boys welcome aboard george learn that word  exhumed from ted the funeral home director if he had anything happen like that at his  i've had it happen many times ted really i certainly have what we normally do is we just 
[03:05:30]  put the legs up through the through the top of the coffin and just rested gently on it we hope nobody  notices cover with flowers yes and sometimes they'll go his feet are out and i'll go  it's a miracle he's alive praise god you don't want to do that to the family you don't want to give  them hope like that ted yes and sometimes they'll think that he's come back to life they'll demand  their money back and they'll have to go no he's really dead who's just had a short coffin  i sell everything death what do you mean everything death sometimes to save money on formaldehyde 
[03:06:00]  i fill them with jelly gregory why why i hear maggots enjoy uh jelly gregory abu ted  i got nervous talking about death their name for this uh establishment yes ted afterlife emporium  after life but we take care of your final expenses  uh danny found an interesting picture what is that dan well these uh let's see rhoda and gaio 26 and 
[03:06:30]  her sons bernard and kelvine killed during post-election unrest are prepared for burial  uh at the mortuary in kisumu that doesn't sound like somewhere around here one side of the  children's coffins had to be broken by a mortuary worker to let the legs out as the caskets were too  small for the boys they actually it's over in kenya my joke the legs are sticking out yes 
[03:07:00]  look at that they're little legs that's not fake come on that's that's a real that's real  and they get up stop walking around and banging into walls their little socks yeah look at their  little dead legs why don't you just fold the legs people want to know what was done with the remaining  pieces of legs i'm sure i would i would just have the dead guy holding them personally we have  10 after life before he has a softball team and you'd be surprised those little legs work very 
[03:07:30]  well as bats we certainly do anthony we bring with the on deck circle because they're heavy  especially after that rigor rigor mortis rigor mortis yes but sometimes you have to set it straight  gregory or the leg will bend back and you'll look silly dude that's sick wow there that that's the  coffins open come on i wonder what kind of mortis they have oh jesus holy jesus christ i missed it what  fuck i wasn't listening again he said i wonder what kind of mortis they have 
[03:08:00]  oh god damn good one danny oh  oh  oh  so inappropriate what it's very funny oh jersey matt from bayonne hey man you lost me at he was a man  shit we gotta start over again oh oh all right focus in this south carolina funeral home has been 
[03:08:30]  forced to shut down after its director admitted one of his employees cut the legs of a corpse without the  family's permission he was a man that was full of love james heinz was a minister who died of skin  cancer in 2004 this funeral home handled the burial for heinz six foot seven frame according to the  measurement on the casket and the funeral director we asked him but this suitable for his 
[03:09:00]  length and he said yeah that'd be perfect the home's director said employees never told heinz family  that his body might not fit in a standard casket but when rumors started to spread  authorities opened an investigation and exhumed his body last april and found that heinz legs had  been cut to fit wow he was six seven holy crap the tall guy would you mind not you personally because  you're dead but i mean like if like um a family member they did what they had to do to get you 
[03:09:30]  know all the parts in there i don't know man yeah maybe deceiving it's it's done you know yeah it's  it's so it's the the deceive the deceit part is is it they could ask look we got this coffin right he's a  a little too tall for it we have a couple options here yeah got a bigger coffin or we can alter  his now lifeless form so he fits into this coffin but you know sometimes works you have to cram him 
[03:10:00]  in there like it's luggage and ask a fat family member to sit on the lid  ted  that's all i have ted great didn't that be a great way to do it though yeah just cramming those stiff  legs in with people sitting on it until you buckle down the side of the coffin gotta like snap it  closed with whatever the coffin snap a little finger sticking out we need a uh some funeral  directors to call because i'm starting to think that this is a standard thing yeah i don't i just 
[03:10:30]  don't think they're making coffins over over six feet whatever it would be well sure the entire nba  dies at one point i had a lot of dead basketball players over here i bet it cost a lot of money  like the custom made that's what i'm saying long one i'm sure you can get it done it's like the  california king but i think in general this is uh this is this is happening more than we realize  without anyone knowing yeah here's the second part of the story it was flex it's pretty tough to sit 
[03:11:00]  and look at something like that authorities revoked the licenses of cave funeral home and its director  and closed the funeral home the state board of funeral service also fined the home's director  five hundred dollars and ordered him to pay fifteen hundred dollars for the investigation i'm just  going through quite a bit this is like starting all over again and it has left me with hurt and  numbness heinz widow says she was shocked after learning her husband of 31 years may have been treated this  way when she threatened to sue the funeral home the business agreed to settle out of court as long as she 
[03:11:30]  did not tell anyone how much she received evidence has also been turned over to criminal investigators  story's got legs  danny had a good one oh what then huh i missed it you know you're going  what was it jimmy you mean or lack thereof yeah 
[03:12:00]  it's just tagging i know it was just funny that he had his face  appropriately and ashamed ashamed buried in his paper fired that one out quietly  yeah the uh funeral home settled out of court okay they didn't have a leg to stand on  that  well you know what it was it's they they they said that um 
[03:12:30]  it was difficult to get him into the coffin and the fact that they got him in it all was an  amazing feat yeah  it feels good to laugh the family didn't want to hear it they're like look we don't care what  ankle you take we just  don't  fair enough  uh  uh  home tried uh their best to uh make amends just saying hey we got off on the wrong foot 
[03:13:00]  you know what though it's it's it's if you're religious to to desecrate the body like that it's a shin  it's a shin it's a shin oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh be more funny  good old direct there was a real heel  Ah, yeah, exactly. 
[03:13:30]  All just, aren't we all, I got a bad one.  Try it.  Just try it.  Just try it.  Just try it.  I don't know.  Just try it.  This is going great.  Come on.  Just try it.  Uh, uh, do you think that, don't worry that we cut his leg off because his knee grows. 
[03:14:00]  I don't know what to do with that.  That's all you do.  What?  Let me just go.  I go, I look at him and go, what?  He put his little lower lip out and just shook his head like, I don't know what to do with it. 
[03:14:30]  All right.  Uh, Dan in Oklahoma, getting custom built coffins aren't easy.  And, um, we got a funeral home director on the line.  I don't want you to use your real name there, sir, because then maybe we could get some,  like, more info out of here.  Just call yourself ghoulish corpse fucker.  Hello?  Hello?  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  Okay.  Hello? 
[03:15:00]  Ghoulish corpse fucker, you're on the line.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi there.  Uh, can we shorten his name, Jimmy?  It's going to be tough to get through this phone call if we have to reference him by that  name every time.  What's your name?  He doesn't want to say.  Don't say your name, sir.  Well, he's supposed to.  Oh, yeah, you're supposed to say it.  What's your name?  My name?  Ghoulish corpse fucker is your name.  I am ghoulish corpse fucker.  Well, fucker of the program.  That's right.  GCF.  Yeah, for now on, you're GCF, right.  Cutting the legs off a corpse, that is desecration of a human body and is illegal. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, wow.  But there are ways to, when you embalm a body, to, like, prop their legs up and they can fit  in any casket, you can lower some, shorten somebody by at least two feet by just drawing  their legs up to their body.  Those people that were fucked up.  And you've got to be uncomfortable your whole eternity.  Yeah.  If your legs bent.  Like you're doing a cannonball.  Stretch.  Yeah.  There's a good laying down in a crying game position for all eternity.  So it works out.  I don't think, uh, well, it beats desecration, I guess. 
[03:16:00]  I want to be cremated.  Do you?  Yeah, man.  I got to get back to ghoulish corpse fucking.  Attaboy.  Go ahead.  Show him the boss.  I like Mike from North Carolina.  Where's Mike?  Has a little comment.  All right.  Uh, let's say hi to Mike.  Yes.  Yeah.  Mike.  Mike?  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Am I here?  Yes, you are, Mike.  What's up, Mike?  Oh, thanks, man.  Uh, yeah, they should have been giving away, uh, or they should have, oh, man.  Oh, my God. 
[03:16:30]  It's out the track.  You're going to have to change your finger on the, start over.  Start over.  You didn't blow it yet.  You didn't say it yet, so start over.  Oh, really?  He didn't say the joke.  All right.  I love your game, Jimmy.  I love you.  I love you, buddy, but I'm not falling for that.  You didn't say the joke.  Step out of the batter's box for a second.  Relax.  Step out of the batter's box.  Relax.  Put your hand up to the pitcher.  If you said the joke and you tripped over it halfway through, that's one thing, but you  didn't even start the joke.  Yeah.  All right.  It should have been given away when the funeral song was put loose. 
[03:17:00]  Thanks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boo!  It should have been given away.  The way he worded that was awful.  Kind of funny.  And actually, I pointed at Mike and said, that's a really good one.  The execution was horrendous.  I thought it was funny that, you know, the song that's playing in there was foot loose.  Right.  You had something, Mike.  I thought it was funny, there's something there, but his delivery stunk. 
[03:17:30]  One would have surmised they would have known when, no, sir.  Ha-ha.  Yeah.  It would have gone, ha-ha.  Do you guys want to go with a few more?  I'd love to.  All right.  Let's go to Jim in New York.  Jim.  What's up, Opie?  Not you.  Jim.  Yes.  Hey.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I wanted to know, when they exhumed the casket, did they find his soulless body  inside?  Ah! 
[03:18:00]  Ah!  Oh, it feels good to laugh.  All right.  That's good.  All right.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Mortuary supply company.  Ugh.  Okay.  Eddie in New Jersey.  Eddie?  How you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, listen.  And I heard there was a statement made by the funeral director that said they perform  these kind of procedures so they can get a leg up on their competition. 
[03:18:30]  Ah!  All right.  That's not bad.  Well, they were actually very religious.  Oh, really?  Really?  They said, uh, they said, uh, they said, I will be done.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  What?  What?  What?  All this talk about bodies is really, get me done.  What the fuck do you get a horn on?  Why don't you is the question. 
[03:19:00]  Why?  Jimmy just stood up, and his dick is puff-tenting his pants.  A little cialis.  What the fuck are you doing?  We're talking about death, you creep.  Look how he stands up, though.  He pushes his pelvis.  He's all happy.  Jimmy gets up, pushes his pelvis out, and shows a bulge in his pants.  He stands there like Superman.  That's right.  Hands on hips, pushing the pelvis out, and showing his plump meat.  Goodness, I like that. 
[03:19:30]  That's going up on the next Craigslist ad I post.  Single mad.  Single man plump meat.  Single mad?  Single mad, yes.  I'm a mother against drunk driving, and I'm single.  Paul the trucker, Ed.  Paul.  I haul children's toys.  Like animals, and big wheel seats.  I pull over, and I smell them. 
[03:20:00]  Hey, Paul.  Hi, Greg.  What's up, Paul?  Paul the trucker.  Hey, Jimmy.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  Hold on.  Thank you.  Thank you, old dear friends.  For coming to my birthday.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, the widow's got to learn how to move on.  We just don't want to put some.  What's that?  Your phone cut out.  Dude, your phone cut out.  I hope it cut out. 
[03:20:30]  If not, that can be.  Sir?  Did the phone cut out?  Go back to the videotape.  It sounds like he just stopped.  I think he panicked.  I don't think his phone cut out.  Who's with me?  I think he panicked.  I think he did.  I think he completely lost confidence or hit an abutment.  Hopefully both.  Let's say hi to Joker.  Joker? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, hey.  Hi.  How's it going, guys?  Hey, Joker.  Hey, this bitch going down in defeat.  Oh, you hear how he said it?  Yeah, a little pause.  Like, joke coming.  This bitch going down in get ready, because here it comes.  He's defeated Bob the Trucker.  Bob.  Hey, it's Bobby Bigger.  What do you say here, guys?  Hey, Bobby.  It's been a while.  How are you, brother?  Hey, help.  You got a change of a buck?  Well, I'm not allowed to talk about that video, by the way.  Oh, okay.  By the way, that video is still happening, and I will pay somebody, but for some reason 
[03:21:30]  we're not allowed to talk about it on our radio show, because that would mean promotion,  I think.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There you go.  But it is happening.  Hey, listen, I found out they're not going to prosecute, because they were advertising  as being a cut above everybody else.  Oh.  Oh.  A little hacky.  But it's Bobby Bigger.  I know.  No crash?  But it's Bobby Bigger.  Oh, come on, crash me anyway, for old times' sake.  There you go, for old times' sake.  Let's go to...  Crash me, for old times' sake. 
[03:22:00]  Can't do it, Sally.  Let's go to Andy from Cleveland.  Andy.  You ever notice when a body's buried, you cut the feet off, and a religious family gets  mad at you?  You ever notice how a body smells when you put your fingers in his hiney after he's been  rotting in the sun or the woods for a week?  You ever notice that I belong in a coffin even more than that body does, and yet I'm still  talking?  You ever notice?  All right, already. 
[03:22:30]  No.  We don't notice anything.  I haven't.  I'm too busy fucking girls.  Thank God you're there to notice everything, because I haven't noticed nothing in my life.  Jesus.  You ever notice?  And Bradley's family didn't say anything, and we did the same thing to him.  We cut his ear off and put his earring on the lid.  You ever notice?  I'm Andy Rooney.  You ever notice?  You've never seen me walking?  My asshole has actually been stuck to this seat since 1973. 
[03:23:00]  You ever notice that?  I like watches.  I talk a lot about watches.  When the big hand's on the 12, I've just shit my pants.  And when the big hand's on the 4, I've just pissed on myself and grabbed my wife's breast.  Then I realize it's her knee.  You ever notice when someone turns around and bent like Oscar Madison?  You put your penis in the wrong hole?  You ever notice that?  I love with your stupid observations. 
[03:23:30]  He's the worst.  Man's a fool.  Hello?  Hi.  I'm sitting here like, okay, faggot.  Let's check.  No, my buddy used to work for a mortuary supply company, and he showed me the showroom one day,  and it's really creepy.  You'd think they could just say, like, you know, embalming fluid on the jar.  But they actually come up with, like, product names, like Fulfill, and one was called Deep Reach. 
[03:24:00]  And it's just all these heinous, disgusting, like, and he, like, unscrewed the cap,  and it's like this gelatinous, like, cotton mess.  It's just, ugh, it's all this stuff.  Fulfill?  And why do they have to use something expensive like formaldehyde?  Why don't they just fill the body with stuffed newspapers?  Well, no, and the day he showed, so the day he showed me the room, there's this urn for ashes. 
[03:24:30]  Why do they call it an urn?  You didn't do anything but die to get it.  You ever notice they rename things improperly?  You ever notice when they want to call something something, they spell it differently?  Why isn't it an E-A-R-N?  Jesus Christ.  I think I'm going to legally change my name. 
[03:25:00]  Holy shit.  Are you?  Oh, Jim.  Holy shit.  That is funny.  You are an ass.  Wait a minute, I'm about to talk it.  All right.  I don't even know what you had.  He was talking about funeral home supplies.  Holy shit.  Why do they call it a satin pillow?  Well, shouldn't it be a lion pillow?  Because that's what you do in a coffin.  You don't sit in a coffin.  Unless you're me.  And you've been doing it for 25 years. 
[03:25:30]  You might want to Google David Carradine.  Oh, yeah.  Is it true?  I don't know.  Let me say, hang on.  What?  Hopefully, he's not over six foot tall.  Oh, no.  No.  Wow, it's true.  Kung Fu?  Kung Fu's dead.  Oh.  How old was he?  73.  David Carradine dead at 73.  Oh, no.  Kill Bill, actually.  I go with the Kill Bill with David Carradine. 
[03:26:00]  Well, you got to go Kung Fu.  Got to go Kill Bill.  They'll say the actor best known for his role as Cain on Kung Fu.  Oh, shit.  Kung Fu.  What the fuck was that?  It's my new sneeze.  It just exploded.  You ever wonder why they call it a coffin and not a sneezing?  I don't think much coffin's really going on in there after they shut the lid. 
[03:26:30]  You'd think they'd call it a rotten, because that's what you're doing.  A rotten.  What size rotten would you like to purchase?  How inappropriate is that?  That would be awful.  What size body box can we get you?  For this fucking burden.  A rotatorium.  Hey, the burden holder.  Can we get you?  What size burden holder for Nana?  What size finally can we get you? 
[03:27:00]  It's called the finally.  What size about time?  When you give all your business to a funeral home that used the term about time instead of confidence.  Can I have the six-foot I could give a shit?  The burden box. 
[03:27:30]  Well, we got more news coming in about that story about the guy's legs being cut off.  Oh, no.  Yeah, Nick in Kansas.  What do you got on that?  Yeah, guys, how are you today?  I was just reading that the exhumation was very easy.  The only other thing, two feet.  Well, you can guarantee nobody heard taps at the funeral. 
[03:28:00]  Boo.  Well, wait, wait.  Let's hold on.  Let's think about it for a second.  What?  What?  I mean, I get it.  I was sitting on it for five minutes.  Come on, taps.  It smelled like your ass.  By the way, Jimmy's Andy Rooney impression made me laugh so hard. 
[03:28:30]  I just fucking was blowing farts for the last five minutes.  It's horrendous over here.  Who's farts?  They call me fart.  You can call me fart.  You can call me fart.  You can call me ass red.  But you doesn't have to call me Erock Mouth.  Oh, goddammit.  Oh, my God.  Wow, there's quite a few of them coming in. 
[03:29:00]  Well, what?  That doesn't make any sense.  What, mine?  Let's say hi to Victor in Baltimore.  Victor?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good, Victor.  Apparently, the man died, went to heaven, and approached the pearly gates, and he was speaking  to St. Peter.  St. Peter said, sir, take a knee.  Oh, wait.  I see somebody's already taken two.  That was, like, a little awful story. 
[03:29:30]  You stumbled through that worse than the guy with no legs would have.  You ever notice when someone's bombing, they tend to try to add more words to the joke?  Hoping we all forget it was meant to be a joke?  That was terrible.  Well, he started, and then, as he approached the pearly gates, pew, and to take a knee,  wait, I see someone's already taken two. 
[03:30:00]  And then he tripped up over it.  God, what a fucking...  A lot of pressure.  What a blithering horse's ass.  Let's go to Drew in Alabama.  Drew.  Yes, sir.  Hi.  Hi, Drew.  Wouldn't you think the funeral home would have footed the bill?  See?  I'm watching out.  It's not bad.  On there it says, did the funeral home foot the bill, which is funny.  Right.  Footed the bill. 
[03:30:30]  Footed the bill is stupid.  Any of these?  I can't see, so how about this?  Yeah.  Fifth one down, whatever it is.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, let's just do numbers now.  Number five, what do you got?  You guys really should ease up on it, because dealing with dead bodies is a thankless job. 
[03:31:00]  Wow.  Thankless job?  What does that even mean?  Ankle, Jimmy.  Ankle.  Thankless job.  I got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  Hey, David Carradine hung himself, it says here.  I'm reading it.  No.  Come on.  He hung himself in a Thai hotel room.  Danny, is that what you're saying?  Well, not that I've read.  David Carradine dead at 73.  Maybe you should update your Google News search, because it says it's hanged in a closet.  Was he well hung?  I think that's the question.  Well, Fox News is reporting that his manager told Fox News that it is believed the actor died of natural causes. 
[03:31:30]  Fox News?  Do you ever notice when you stop breathing, they don't consider it natural causes?  We all die in natural causes, don't we?  According to Fox News, Danny, you can never be married.  Why?  What's wrong with gay marriage?  Whatever.  What the fuck?  Oh, we called you gay because you referenced Fox News.  Oh.  Sir.  Terrible. 
[03:32:00]  All right.  Bill and Canada.  Thank you, Bill.  Hold on.  Did he hang himself or not?  What channel is this?  Is this worstmustacheever.com we're looking at?  There's a guy.  He looks like Sonny Bono with a fucking Hitler mustache on.  What a fool that guy is.  Yeah, AP.  Actually, AP is reporting that he may have hung himself.  What?  Why?  The Thai hotel room.  Oh, maybe somebody was closing in.  Oops.  Oh, no.  Wow, really? 
[03:32:30]  Kung Fu?  Oh.  Kung Fu.  Kung Fu.  That's all right.  I like Kung Fu.  Kung Fu is funny.  I like Kung Fu.  Where else are you going to go with that?  Yeah.  Where else are you going to go with that?  Maybe just leave it alone.  Fair enough.  That's an option.  Are we done with the dead body jokes?  I think that's about it.  Yeah.  I was trying to think of another one, but I think I'm fresh out.  With Carradine, it depends on the source. 
[03:33:00]  Some sources are reporting that he died of natural causes.  The AP story reports that he may have hung himself.  So anybody that picks up the AP story is going to report that.  What do they mean he may have hung himself?  Yeah.  Was there something around his neck?  Yeah, really.  Wouldn't that be obvious?  That's not one you have to debate.  He was in Bangkok.  He either hung himself or that's a really awkward tie.  I'm not sure what happened to investigate.  With his pants around his ankles and his Kung Fu old man dick in his hand. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, we're not.  I'm going to keep doing that old man, Jimmy.  You little fucker.  Oh, we promised Kenny's morning mashup, Hollywood 411, in case you didn't hear it earlier.  We've got to play this again.  This will lead to a brand new segment on the Opie and Anthony show.  More good.  We're blatantly stealing it.  Yep.  Kenny's Hollywood 411 coming to the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's the first one, I guess.  Are we leaving or staying?  We'll stay for a minute or two.  Kenny.  Yeah, hi.  No, I'm doing sign language. 
[03:34:00]  Jesus.  Yeah, hi.  Kenny.  Eh?  Eh?  Or eh?  You're terrific.  Eh?  You're the greatest.  Eh?  You're the best.  Eh?  No, go ahead.  Entertain people.  Jimmy's just staring at his shoes.  You don't like his shoes, Jimmy?  His fucking foot lumps show through them.  They're awful.  Kenny's legs should be cut off just for wearing those shoes. 
[03:34:30]  They really should.  It's punishment.  They might have to do that to you, Kenny.  Oh.  What?  Cut your legs off.  Or your head.  Just cut the head off.  How obvious would that be?  It wouldn't be.  If you talked to him, you wouldn't even notice.  Put it in a fucking hat box.  That little teeny head.  Cut it right off with a little Swiss knife.  What?  Kenny, are you getting sick?  Yeah, I woke up with a scratchy throat. 
[03:35:00]  Did you itch it?  I don't think you've ever been sick.  No, I'm too stupid to get sick.  Yeah.  Is your throat still scratchy?  Yeah, I've been taking, like, throat lozenges.  I got something you might want to try.  What, a dose of Dr. Jim's two-ball compound?  No.  I don't even know why this show is funny today, to be honest with you. 
[03:35:30]  I know the material's there, but it's just...  I can't fucking take...  I'm laughing too goddamn hard at this shit.  And Breitbart...  Yeah.  There was a lot of listeners today.  Did it make drugs?  For the stupidity.  I don't know.  Probably not.  Why would it?  I mean, we followed up with a cum, period, fucking juice, snot discussion.  And that's why it would.  Here's Kenny's Hollywood 411 from earlier.  Sirius XM.  Yes, for all.  Music and Entertainment 411. 
[03:36:00]  411.  411.  411.  And now it's time for the Entertainment 411 on Sirius Hits 1 and XM 20 on 20 with me,  Crazy Kenny, the king of the mashup.  Susan Boyle lost the English American Idol.  You know why she always wears long dresses?  Because if she wore a short skirt, her balls would stick out.  I hope she likes to drink because God invented alcohol so ugly people could fuck.  It's one.  Rumor has it Bruno is hooking up with Adam Lambert. 
[03:36:30]  I can't wait to see pictures of their shit-stained cocks after they bump uglies.  Hey, that reminds me.  Do you know why semen and urine are different colors?  So those people know if they're coming or going.  And that also reminds me, what's the difference between anal sex and a microwave?  A microwave won't brown your meat.  John and Kate Plus 8 are all over the news.  I hope they're breaking up because I'd like to finger bang Kate. 
[03:37:00]  She'd start complaining.  Oh, your ring hurts.  I'd say, honey, that's not my ring.  That's my wristwatch.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  You know, because after eight kids, she's got a big cunt.  I'm crazy, Kenny.  And that's the entertainment 411 on the mashup.  Serious hits won.  XM 20 on 20.  Let's mash it up.  You got the 411.  Get it.  11 minutes passed.  Unless we're...  Mm-hmm.  Bravo.  Funny man there, Kenny. 
[03:37:30]  Yes, you are.  Thank you, but you guys are an inspiration to me.  Right.  Really?  Yes.  I want you to jump out a window.  Never notice Morley Safer looks like someone's wearing a liver-spotted Richard Nixon wig.  Never notice that.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Oh, did you find one? 
[03:38:00]  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  A little feedback.  What happened?  What happened?  Ha ha ha ha ha.  I think he's got one.  I don't know if it's...  Oh.  I don't know if it's good or bad.  It's making me laugh though.  Okay.  This is from Chris C in Virginia.  It's going back to the funeral home.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Of course.  They say he always tried to be a good Samaritan.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.  He's going with bone.  Bone jokes. 
[03:38:30]  We have time for one more.  I wonder who had to patella the family.  Kneecap joke.  I got it.  I got it.  I listen, you.  I hear you. 
[03:39:00]  Say hi to you.  Russell in Indiana.  Russell.  Hey, listen, you.  Hey, man.  You need to check out the BBC report of Carradine.  It says a hotel maid found him in a closet with a rope around his neck and his genitals.  No.  No.  Come on.  No shit.  Check it out.  No shit.  Love you, boys.  Yes, of course you do.  We're lovable.  All right. 
[03:39:30]  One more thing.  You might think you can sing.  But you're wrong.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp.  Go up and smoke, baby.  And learn to sing like a champ.  Ain't no sense I'm going home.  Judy got your girl gone.  Ain't no sense I'm going home.  Joe doesn't just teach you to sing the classics.  He beats the awful right out of you.  When a man loves a woman.  Words is the most important thing to, let's say, songs. 
[03:40:00]  Because sometimes, you know, you...  After a few short weeks with Joe's unique approach to vocal training,  you'll be belting out tunes just like Smoke and Joe belted Muhammad Ali.  Ooh.  Or you'll have brain damage.  Ah.  Spend two amazing weeks in Joe Frazier's 700-square-foot apartment above his Philadelphia boxing gym.  And floor your friends with your amazing vocal chops.  Joe might have high blood pressure, diabetes, and needs to carry a cane to stand upright,  but his magical voice will bring you to tears.  Mustang's telling now, baby. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, yeah.  Think you better slow than Mustang down.  Ow.  And if that doesn't, his left hook will.  You'll be hitting the high notes faster than Joe Frazier hits the canvas.  Come to Joe Frazier's Karaoke Camp, where our motto is...  Me, you ain't used these as you've been.  I like it, but I didn't like the singing underneath it.  I didn't think it should have had the actual songs in there.  Don't tell that to Derek.  He'll get pissed off. 
[03:41:00]  Oh, man.  No, it should have just been Joe.  Derek doesn't like redoing these things, Jimmy.  It should have just been voice lessons.  Danny, am I right?  Derek doesn't like redoing these things.  Well, sometimes it's hard to find, you know, karaoke versions of...  Oh, boy.  That's true.  A lot of femur jokes coming in.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  What are the jokes?  I just want you to awkwardly say that.  You know, too bad.  He wasn't a femur.  Wait. 
[03:41:30]  Hold on a minute.  Sounds like it's going to be a good one.  That's what I'm getting at.  They put him in a...  This is a good sign.  His feedback is fucking flying by.  All right.  Booch in Philly.  They put him in a smaller casket because otherwise the fee would be mer.  Fee more?  Fee more?  Fee would be mer.  Yeah.  Fee would be mer. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, that's right, guys.  And then, if only he were a femur inches shorter.  That's really bad.  The investigators were really stumped by this case.  That's good.  That's CB in Atlanta.  Go with the stump.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I don't remember where it's going to be.  Dan, you're raising your hand?  Oh, what? 
[03:42:30]  Oh, shit.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  I was wondering if you could tell me where I could buy a pair of Complete Pans.  Our pal, Rob Bartlett.  How's Ivis doing, Rob?  He's doing great.  Yeah?  He's doing great.  He's on this holistic deal, and it's working.  It's working.  It's working.  Good, good, good, good.  Yeah, he's got a little problem there, huh? 
[03:43:00]  Yeah, he's got a little bit of the prostate.  You know, a little prostate.  He's got the big casino.  Big casino, Tony.  He's beating it, so.  Very good.  Good to hear.  Yeah.  Hey, are you still doing shows, Rob, or is he taking off?  No, he's actually broadcasting from the ranch.  We're about to go on a two-week vacation, but he's out there with the kids, and it's all good.  Very good.  I hear you're doing some, your son's doing a fundraiser?  Yeah, he's actually, he's doing this walk for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation. 
[03:43:30]  It's just Saturday I had a long time on, and, you know, he's been fighting that for the past four or five years,  and he's actually on the road to recovery himself, but he's going, uh...  Wait, what does he have there, Rob?  It's, uh, Colitis.  Also, he's got Colitis.  And, uh, so he's, uh, he's been fighting that, and, uh...  But now he's doing a walk for them, for, uh, you know, like, one of those walk of Buckfields,  and so that's what he's doing, uh, out of Mestico Marjorie Post this, uh, this Saturday. 
[03:44:00]  So, uh...  How do people, uh, like, you know, because Crohn's is a bitch, man.  What is, what is it, what does it do to you?  I don't know, it fucks up your, your intestines, will you...  What exactly does, don't give you a terrible description, but it's deadly.  It's like having, it's like having an ulcer, but in your intestines.  Ow.  So it's just, it's unbelievably painful, and you lose a whole bunch of weight.  I, I had it, you know, um, most of my life when I was a kid,  and then I, uh, I actually, I got to a point where they were able to do something about it. 
[03:44:30]  Why didn't you ever lose weight?  Well, I did initially, but, you know, now I wish to take out the whole, you know,  fucking colon, and then maybe I'd lose more weight.  But, uh...  How do people help out your son there, uh...  Oh, they didn't, uh, they're on a straight interview.  I actually, um, it's cc...  cc.  Takesteps.org.  cctakesteps.org.  And they can, uh, click on the, uh, New York Long Island Walk. 
[03:45:00]  Okay.  And, uh, and sponsor Devin.  D-E-V-I-N.  Team, Team Devin is what he's doing.  D-E-V-I-N.  Team Devin.  Let's get the numbers up for Devin.  Oh, that'd be great, man.  cc.takesteps.org.  Yeah.  Right.  So...  All right.  Everything else good?  Everything's cool, man.  I miss you guys.  I'm, uh...  Are you doing any, uh, any plays?  Broadway?  Where you at?  No, no, no plays.  I'm doing, I'm doing this new thing.  I call it Mr. Wacky Happy Pants.  And I, I spray seltzer, um, on myself. 
[03:45:30]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's so much fun.  And, uh...  Sounds like a riot.  Yeah.  And, uh, and I'm working on a smokeless cigarette.  So that way there'd be something else I could do after not having sex.  Yeah, no kidding.  But, uh...  You picked one of the most energetic parts of our show.  Yeah.  You've just been laughing for about an hour straight.  Yeah, we gotta explain that to you, Rob.  We're, we're, we're spent.  And we're exhausted. 
[03:46:00]  So, so, okay, so basically just saying...  I just hope the list, I just hope the listener was laughing as much.  Basically, I'm, I'm fucking you the way I fuck on it every morning.  Danny, cut this out of the replay so we have a perfect show.  Oh, shit.  Hey, L.P., when are you getting married?  I'm still waiting for my invitation.  Oh, fuck.  Damn.  God damn it, you were on the short list.  Yeah, short list.  So there's a guy in the coffin.  What?  When a boss goes someplace before me, there's a problem, okay?  Oh, fuck.  I didn't invite you? 
[03:46:30]  No.  God damn it, I stink.  Why don't you do this to me?  Why don't you treat me from this?  You can, you know what, though?  You can still, like, uh, send me a wedding gift, though.  It's not too late.  Oh, oh, yeah, that'll happen.  Why?  If I don't get the chicken, can I, um, you're gonna get a fucking blender?  What am I?  What do I look like?  Um, Rob Bartlett.  Right.  What is he, stupid?  I already bought you four tickets for The Odd Couple.  Yeah, that's true.  Why the fuck couldn't you get those tickets for free?  That's bullshit. 
[03:47:00]  You were in the play.  Believe me.  Rob Bartlett did do that for us.  We went and saw The Odd Couple.  By the way, you were the best on that stage, my friend, and you had some big actors alongside  you.  You had, uh, Brad Garrett, and, uh, and, uh, and you know what?  You were way better than Nathan Lane, and I'm not just saying that.  Nathan Lane was not believable as, uh...  Felix?  As, uh, Felix, right?  No, Oscar.  He was Oscar, and, uh...  Yeah, he was Oscar, you're right.  But he was so not believable as Oscar.  You kicked ass in that play. 
[03:47:30]  And then I wanted to go, and they fucking, uh, make Rob, uh, you know, uh, pay for the  four tickets.  Well, you know, they wanted to charge us for being in it.  It was a good play, man.  Actually, you can't go wrong with Neil Simon.  Nathan was fine.  I was his understudy, and the one time he was sick, I was on vacation.  So who did it?  The second understudy.  Some kid who, I hope, you know, dies as slow.  I didn't know there was a second understudy.  I had no idea. 
[03:48:00]  Oh, they had, well, in situations like that, they had to.  Rob Bartlett could have been a big star.  That's right.  I could have been a contender.  I could have been somebody.  He's been a bum, which is what I am.  You should have left there for me, Uncle.  All right, just send me the wedding gift, and all will be forgiven.  Oh, that's our music, Rob.  We gotta go.  What do you want?  Like a cock ring?  No, I never did the cock ring.  No?  No.  How about a butt plug that looks like a lava lamp?  Never did?  Oh, jeez, wow.  It doesn't matter what it looks like, as long as it gets as hot. 
[03:48:30]  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, sweetie.  All right, listen, it's cctakesteps.org.  Join Team Devin and help him out.  Rob's a good friend of the show.  And congratulations to you guys for the big comeback.  Thanks so much, guys, and you too.  I hear the ratings are great, and you guys are adding affiliates.  You guys added affiliates as we lost affiliates.  That made us feel real good.  Yeah, yeah.  I can tell you.  Affiliates, and affiliates left and right.  The numbers are great.  And, you know, getting bigger as we speak. 
[03:49:00]  So it's all good.  But it's great to be back.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  All right, my friend.  Love you, guys.  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  I'm punching out now.  Oh, punch out, Rob.  I'm going to Florida.  I just want to throw it out real quick.  Thursday, June 18th, Fort Lauderdale, Hollywood at the Hard Rock.  And 19th, 20th, Palm Beach Improv in West Palm Beach.  Coming to Florida.  Florida?  Yeah, ma'am.  18, 19, 20.  That's cool.  Yeah, the improv's down there.  All right.  It's been a long time since I've been to Florida. 
[03:49:30]  Danny, just cut that out.  Everyone is looking forward to my return.  Yes.  That's the big word down there.  The great James.  I have one hand on my ass cheek and one on my dick for no reason.  You still have a boner?  No.  Okay, good.  I'm just holding it.  When did the boner, you know, go down?  Soon we quit talking about death.  We all know about death.  Y'all love Elias.  All right, guys.  Never notice.  You always say William Defoe would have to be corrected. 
[03:50:00]  William, yes.  Get me out of here.  All right.  Ron and Fezz are up next.  Thanks, guys.  Later.  Later. </pre>
