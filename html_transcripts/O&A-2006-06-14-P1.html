<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts' characteristically vulgar and self-deprecating introductions, insulting themselves and their crew, including Hurricane Ben, Martini Steve, and E-Roc.  Bill Burr filled in for Jim Norton, who was appearing on Jay Leno's Tonight Show.  A major segment promoted "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday," a listener-driven event involving "WOW" stickers on cars, allegedly resulting in women flashing the drivers.  The hosts detailed sticker distribution locations and the segment's history.  They then expressed anxiety about their own past and potential future appearances on late-night television (specifically Letterman and Leno), sharing anecdotes about awkward encounters and their coping mechanisms, including cultivating hatred for the host.

The conversation shifted to a discussion of recent New York City stabbings, prompting a discussion of street safety and mugging tactics, with Ben and Anthony sharing personal near-miss stories. The show showcased the studio's PalTalk cameras, highlighting bizarre and potentially dangerous viewer interactions.  A significant portion promoted Opie and Anthony's upcoming comedy tour, detailing the lineup and venues (Worcester, MA; Holmdel, NJ; and Camden, NJ), alongside discussions of booking difficulties and past conflicts with certain cities.  They contrasted a Stephen Hawking article warning of Earth's impending doom (buried on page 23) with trivial news stories about Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, highlighting the absurdity of news prioritization.

The broadcast then detailed a disastrous promotional event in Buffalo, NY ("T&A with O&A"), which escalated into public nudity, sex acts, and a near-arrest situation, resulting in a media frenzy and FCC complaints (despite not being a broadcast) and a subsequent ban from Buffalo. The hosts mocked a rival show's "Mantown" segment, with Bill Burr participating in the ensuing listener-fueled ridicule, incorporating vulgar alternative slogans and descriptions.  This segment also included satirical commentary on fear-mongering "scary news teases" from various news stations covering topics ranging from 9/11 to sex offenders.

A following segment started with discussions of submissions for their "news tease hall of fame," specifically one about hiccups and cancer. This transitioned into a visit from frequent guests Tippy Tom and Blue, two homeless individuals. Their appearance, marked by Tippy Tom's body odor and unkempt state, prompted much comedic commentary from the hosts and Bill Burr, including physical examinations and ribbing of their hygiene and living situations.  Technical difficulties with their wireless microphones were also addressed. A significant portion detailed their "walk" from the studio to their XM broadcast location, involving Tippy Tom, Blue, and a poorly performing marching band, documenting interactions with street people and bystanders.  This culminated in a discussion of a potential conflict with the JV and Elvis show over a comedy tour, involving accusations of idea theft and concluding with further banter and speculation about the conflict.

The show continued with a discussion of Opie and Anthony's upcoming "Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus" comedy tour and their perceived mistreatment by CBS Broadcasting management regarding a scheduling conflict. This involved humorous banter and discussions of tour lineup (including Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton), reasons for other comedians declining (like Brian Regan), Bob Saget's unexpectedly dirty humor, the Beach Boys, a tribute band's experiences in Honduras and Trinidad, a listener's uncomfortable bathroom encounter ("Mantown"), and the difficulties of canceling an AOL account, punctuated by a frustrating customer service call recording. The segment included further discussion of Tippy Tom (who was sleeping or unconscious at some point).  The hosts also speculated about their future in radio and potential retirement.

The broadcast concluded with a prank call to AOL customer service, involving a caller pretending to cancel his father's account due to excessive usage and visits to questionable websites.  The call highlighted the representative's persistent attempts to retain the account.  This transitioned into a "Homeless Radio" segment with Tippy Tom and Blue, discussing a wide array of current events (Iraq War, World Cup, Hurricane season, global warming, gay marriage, the immigration bill, KFC lawsuit, Al-Zarqawi's death) and random thoughts, characterized by its informal and vulgar nature, rapid topic changes, and host interjections.  The segment ended with closing remarks and chaotic banter, including a final reference to a woman flashing her breasts.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Ovi and Anthony Show on XM202 featuring Ovi, Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We eat so dang.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show. 
[00:00:30]  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony.  Ovi.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You care like Chuck.  No, that's...  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating fool that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Roc.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:01:00]  I don't care.  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian Am.  Shut up!  Let's go.  Ha ha ha!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  You will keep your hands off of my meal. 
[00:01:30]  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Let's go.  Don't fall for that old guy.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America on this fine Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:02:00]  Yes.  Aren't Wednesdays great for that?  This is our greatest thing.  This is the thing.  This is the thing we came up with.  The thing.  We've come up with a lot of things, but this is the big thing.  It's the thing.  It's the thing.  Yes, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  You get a sticker on your car, a WOW sticker, or it doesn't even have to be a sticker if  you don't have one right now.  We would like you to because it kind of shows appreciation for the program.  But dirt in the back of the truck, we've seen that. 
[00:02:30]  People just scrape WOW on there.  The sign you make at home.  If you're too lazy to send out a self-addressed stamped envelope.  Remember the old days?  Boston will remember this.  We came up with WOW in Boston and the radio station didn't really see it our way.  So we couldn't get bumper stickers made.  So remember the days when Boston was just littered with homemade WOW signs.  Yep.  Littered with homemade WOW signs.  So if you can't get your hands on a WOW sticker, that's good, too. 
[00:03:00]  Stupid Dave Douglas.  Dave.  I don't think this WOW thing is a smart idea.  This isn't smart.  I think they're chasing away our...  I don't think it's a smart idea.  Chasing away the women listeners.  Is it jerk?  Is it...  Where are you working today?  No, it's not.  Where are you working today, Dave?  It's not a good idea.  Well, you get your WOW sticker.  How do they do that?  I have no idea.  I've got to send a self-addressed stamped envelope. 
[00:03:30]  To Venus.  I don't know where they send it to.  I don't even know what websites we're allowed to promote yet.  Who the hell knows?  If you're hearing us on a commercial radio station, go to that website.  Oh.  And hopefully, if they're motivated, they'll have a way for you to get your WOW stickers.  I'm pretty sure they're motivated.  Most of them are.  Most of them are very motivated that we're on their fine station.  Yes.  And then the XM Nation, they know what to do.  They absolutely know what to do to get their WOW stickers.  All right? 
[00:04:00]  Right.  So it's a way from our Wednesday.  You get the WOW in your car.  And I'm telling you, people get surprised every week when we tell them this.  But there are ladies out there that are driving around right now.  And if they see a WOW sticker, they will flash you.  Yeah.  They will flash you.  You're just driving.  You don't even know what the hell's going on.  All of a sudden, some woman's flashing you.  You go, why is she doing that?  And then it hits you.  Oh, yeah.  I put that WOW sticker on a while back.  It's like fishing.  That's the first thought you have?  Why is she doing that?  Why is she doing that? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, my God.  Look at those.  Look at those beauties.  What on earth would somebody do?  That's dangerous.  Why is she doing it?  Hey, lady, that's dangerous.  Oh, wait a minute.  It's because I have a WOW sticker on it.  But the beauty is that Anthony is onto something because there are a lot of times guys will  go, oh, my God, that's right.  I have a WOW sticker on my car.  You kind of forget.  That's what we ask people, too.  You just throw the WOW sticker on the back of your car and just go about your business.  Be patient.  Don't harass the ladies.  That's not what we're all about.  There are plenty of ladies out there that will just do it on their own. 
[00:05:00]  People think when they throw it on, it's going to be that day, like a Girls Gone Wild video.  Like they're just going to be on their car.  Like one of those jungle habitat drive-thru safaris where naked girls are throwing themselves  on your windshield, ripping off your antenna, banging on your doors.  You have a whole vat of Juergens in your passenger seat just waiting for it to happen.  Big roll of paper towels in your glove compartment.  Here they come.  All right, ladies, do what you do.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I got my WOW sticker.  Thank God I went with the vinyl seats. 
[00:05:30]  It's like fishing.  You got to like, you know, take your rod and cast out and, you know, kind of wait for it.  Be patient.  Don't make a lot of noise.  Right.  You'll scare them.  You'll scare them away.  Don't make noise.  All you got to do is drive.  And we don't want to confuse the ladies.  Every day, we're looking for you to flash.  Pretty much turned in to whip them out whenever.  Yeah, we just celebrate on Wednesdays.  Yeah.  And for the guys out there, and there are some ladies that also want to see some flashing. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you know, get your WOW stickers when you're on your way to a sporting event, a concert,  the beaches this summer.  Those are the places where you get a lot of flashing going on.  Especially if you have a WOW sticker.  It happens all the time.  So there you go.  I know Free FM here in New York City, they got WOW sticker stops all over the place today.  Yep.  Including the Walt Whitman Mall, Anthony, on Long Island.  Ah, my old stomping ground of Huntington, Long Island.  Yeah, so if you're going to be around the Walt Whitman Mall on Long Island today, the van will be there, I guess. 
[00:06:30]  The Free FM van with WOW stickers from 10 a.m. to noon.  The Walt Whitman Mall.  Walt Whitman Mall.  Dude, you want to go to the food court?  Walt Whitman.  It's very important out there for some reason.  The Albert Einstein strip mall.  Yeah, yeah.  You're laughing at that, Bill.  Dude, let's get a tat.  You're laughing at that, but we're also going to be at the rest stop near the Tappan Zee Bridge today from 10 to noon.  Oh, great.  That's another one.  Apparently the rest stop sticker stops are pretty big. 
[00:07:00]  They're huge.  Like a lot of people show up.  And then.  It's a rest stop.  They got a lot of traffic through there.  Wow.  Okay.  We're just moving.  Our careers are like this, Bill.  Come on.  I'm telling you.  I know.  A couple times ago, I was with you in that Radio Shack.  Now you got a rest area coming up.  All right.  Don't remind us of the Radio Shack.  The Radio Shack.  It wasn't even a Radio Shack.  Bill Burr looks at us and goes, guys, I don't even have to do these gigs anymore.  Yeah.  I was literally like, you know, I don't want to come off as an egomaniac, but not only are you guys beyond this, I think I might be beyond this. 
[00:07:30]  Right.  That was one of the worst organized appearances.  Oh, sure.  He couldn't have been at Tower Records the other day.  Yeah.  Friday.  When we were signing from six o'clock till about 930.  Yeah.  We signed over three hours.  You know, I'm not buying it.  I'm sure you're not.  I think you're doing this.  Dude, you should have been here yesterday.  There was a line around the block.  It was.  There was a line.  There was a line going around the block for people to get in.  And you end up at that appearance we did where there's 10 people, mutants, drooling, standing in front of us. 
[00:08:00]  It was awful.  Oh, it was terrible.  Then you have a little contest and then like half the crowd has to leave just so you can get something going.  It was like you, me, and a security guard.  That was awful.  That was organized like garbage.  That brings us down to earth a little bit.  Yeah, sometimes.  Just when we think we're getting really, really big, that happens to us.  Too big for your britches.  That happens.  That was like, you know, most of the college gigs I've done. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  I'm like, all right, I got this credit.  This credit is definitely going to be some people.  Then you're just in a cafeteria.  You're almost embarrassed with your credits.  This guy's been on HBO.  Oh, oh.  Like echoing in this big empty room.  Because you're just thinking everyone's thinking, well, what happened to him that he's here?  Yeah.  Drug problems, I bet you.  I bet you.  Like they're trying to come up with their own ideas that it was.  What do you think it was?  Sickness?  Do you think he has some kind of illness that kept him from pursuing that big HBO thing?  Oh, yeah.  And then the people at the college are trying to make excuses like, there was a big volleyball 
[00:09:00]  tournament tonight.  It is.  There was a mixer last night.  A lot of people were out, hungover.  We put your posters up.  I don't know what happened.  We flyered every windshield wiper in the parking lot.  Yeah.  This is the inside stuff.  It's the truth.  Well, get your WOW stickers.  We're very excited about whipping out Wednesday.  Of course we are.  It's a great way to spread the virus, especially in these new cities, okay?  Yes.  And the official WOW t-shirt. 
[00:09:30]  Jesus, we are just whores.  They're there for people to buy if they want.  We're not forcing them down their throat, but go to my radio.  One, two, though.  Forces down.  Watching them choke on it.  Choke on this shirt.  Open Anthony t-shirts, including the brand new WOW t-shirt, myradiostore.com.  There.  We're done, okay?  In studio today, Bill Burr.  Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton.  Who had to fly out to the left coast to do Jay Leno, I think, tomorrow night?  He's doing Leno.  It's Thursday night, right?  Tomorrow night?  Why two nights? 
[00:10:00]  Huh?  Why does he get two nights?  Why didn't he just fly out?  He gets to do what he wants.  Why didn't he just fly out yesterday?  Or tomorrow, I mean.  Yesterday.  No, he's probably got to go down there.  What does he do?  He probably does a couple of spots somewhere.  Yeah, he's got to warm up.  That's it.  I would need like a week.  There are these little rumblings going on that we're going to be on Letterman.  Little rumblings.  They've already spoken, and they're just figuring out a scheduling thing.  And I can't, like, deal with that. 
[00:10:30]  I can't fathom it.  I can't deal with it on a base human level.  Like, I need a week off just to sit and lay in the fetal position shaking.  I can't do that.  I could get up.  That's the first level.  I could get up in front of, like, a live audience when we do our road shows and things like that without a problem.  I could get up with a band and do that.  But there's something about there's just that stigma with the Leno-Letterman thing with going on those shows. 
[00:11:00]  We've done other shows, you know, Donnie Deutsch.  You go on a Donnie Deutsch, there's no problem.  Hannity and Combs, I'll sit down and BS with the best of them.  Let's not forget one of our greatest appearances, the John McEnroe show.  The John McEnroe show, I believe, two episodes before cancellation.  That looked a lot like being on Letterman except for the ratings and except for the really good host.  Because you had to walk out and wave like you would do on Letterman and sit on a couch.  Wasn't there an audience? 
[00:11:30]  He had a live audience for that one.  Yeah, there was a live audience.  So we sat down and everything, but there is just this thing.  And they had to bust the audience in from, like, the ghetto.  Oh, this is the worst.  So we come out, you know, they introduce us, and there's a handful of people that know who we are,  and they're losing their minds, and the rest are just toothless, clueless.  The rest, it's like warm weather, but they're wearing snorkel jackets.  And they're throwing up gang signs.  I was petrified.  Whenever I do shows where I'm going to be nervous, 
[00:12:00]  what I end up doing is I literally have to work up, like, a healthy level of hatred for the host.  Oh, that's something good.  This guy's going to think I'm going to suck, right?  It's like all my insecurities.  And I literally have to be like, you know, F this guy as I'm walking.  Oh, that's a good idea.  That's what you do.  So it's taking the imagine them in their underwear to, like, another level.  To another level.  Instead, it takes that superiority over you thing away.  If you hate him, he's just another ass.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not going to. 
[00:12:30]  What am I going to do?  Tap dance for you?  Exactly.  Like John Mack.  Oh, you won the U.S. Open.  Say tennis, buddy.  So, like, the PA.  Is everything okay?  You look a little weird.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  There's that whole thing, though, with a Leno or a Letterman, which is just, it transcends any other thing you've done.  And I can't imagine, and I always have, you know, for years of watching Johnny Carson growing up, it always struck me, like, how do they stand back there behind that curtain when they announce their name and not just fall down and actually muster up the gumption to walk out on that stage with a smile on their face? 
[00:13:00]  I think we just go out there and do it.  Just do it.  Yeah, I understand that part of it.  In the first hacky joke, I'm going to go right into Letterman's face and go, that'll break the ice.  I'll never be back.  That'll break the ice.  I'll show him. 
[00:13:30]  I don't know.  How many people have said, I'll show him?  It's not that I don't think.  And then they eat their shorts.  And he just goes to commercial and comes back and you're not there anymore.  Not there anymore.  Ladies and gentlemen, let's bring on.  And they don't even explain.  You're not in the position of power.  They don't even explain.  You're the guest.  No.  I know, because you have to sit a lot lower.  I see the tricks they do.  Is that true?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  You have to sit a little lower so you're not in the power position.  How about hawking a loogie into his cup of water?  That's a good one. 
[00:14:00]  Starts it off just like, hey, screw you.  You're going to have cotton mouth this conversation, my friend.  I think we could develop a fine appearance for David Letterman if we sit down with the people and talk this out.  I think there's plenty to talk about.  It's not that that gets me.  Like, to sit down and discuss things is fine.  That's easy.  It's actually walking out.  Like, waiting.  Maybe they could wheel you out like Hannibal Lecter.  That might be good.  Have you been a two-wheeler?  It's that waiting before they call your name. 
[00:14:30]  That just is...  I can't deal with it.  I need, like...  You're staying up at night.  I think he's going to implode.  I've got to go la la la la.  You're staying up at night.  Oh, this has been torturing me ever since they said it.  I've been sleeping like a baby.  Torturing me.  At this point, what's going to happen is going to happen.  I know, but it's just one of those things.  It's like a milestone moment in your life.  And that's crazy for me to say.  Sorry, Bill.  Because we haven't all done it.  Dude, I'm not acting like I wasn't nervous.  Oh, okay.  You kidding me?  I was just sitting there. 
[00:15:00]  I told you that the nightmare I had before doing that show, I went out on Letterman.  I started bombing, and then I looked over at his desk, and my dad was sitting there.  Oh, that speaks volumes.  Oh, yeah.  That's like page one psychology.  You don't even have to know anything about it.  Letterman's like the father figure.  Of course.  Of comedy, and you're still looking for the approval.  Looking for approval and failing miserably at what you're supposed to do.  Oh, just horrific.  What was your father doing?  Was he going, you stink? 
[00:15:30]  No, he was just sitting there looking at me.  Was he disgusted?  Yeah.  I didn't know if he was disgusted.  He was just sitting there looking at me, expressionless, and I was just up there in his suit, sweating.  Oh, no.  I couldn't see the crowd, and I was just, I just had, I completely forgot all my material.  That's like the biggest fear you have.  What if I go out there, and I just, I forget what I'm going to say, and then you have to block that thought out?  Yeah.  Like, you know, something, you know.  And do you remember what you're supposed to say right up until you say it? 
[00:16:00]  What do you mean?  In real life or in a dream?  Well, no, in real life, because I know singing with bands my whole life pretty much, there would be points where the band would start, start the song.  I know the song, but I'm standing there going, oh, my God, I have no clue what the first line of this song is.  And the part's coming up where I got to sing, and I'm there in front of the mic, there's people, and I'm going, not a clue, oh, my God, is it that, no, that's the second verse, you idiot. 
[00:16:30]  What, what's, how does this start?  And then the second I'm supposed to start singing, it kicks in, and you're singing the song.  But the horror that you're just going to be like, duh.  Oh, yeah.  It's like the longest seven seconds of your life.  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  Our radio shows like that every day.  That's true.  Just plunk the mic down.  I'm just sitting down at that desk in the other office going, God, what are we going to do today?  What are we going to talk about?  This is like the first time we've ever been on radio, but the mics go on, and then you just start talking about stuff. 
[00:17:00]  And you figure if you've done it for 10 years or so, you're going to be able to do it that day.  I hope.  That's not going to be the day you go, the mics are on, not, nothing.  Let's go to Sean in Virginia.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, when you guys go on Letterman, is Anthony going to do that gay little bow like at Jimmy Norton's HBO?  I'm never going to live down that bow.  It's now immortalized on DVD.  Is it, though?  I think it is.  That's the one they used?  Yes, I did the classic Renaissance-type bow where you kind of take your arm and move it in a circular fashion as you bow down in front of you. 
[00:17:30]  As you bow, right.  Like a yes, my lord kind of thing.  I was giving Jimmy the tribute he so duly deserved on his big day.  Yeah, I thought you were mocking the bow.  I was mocking the bow.  I didn't think you were actually serious.  I mean, I know you have a sword.  I didn't think you took it that far.  It's a rapier, my friend.  Oh, my fault.  My fault.  Yeah, they're called rapiers.  We learned that.  It's a rapier. 
[00:18:00]  We learned that on this show.  You got a big Stevie Ray Vaughan hat with a feather coming out of the side.  Some frilly pirate-like clothes.  We were just so happy to be there and happy that we were getting some recognition on HBO.  I know.  They cut out.  Because I gave him a thumbs up like, you go, Jimmy.  You go.  You gave a lame thumbs up.  I actually gave a point at him.  I didn't get the thumbs up in the actual special because that was the second taping.  It was done twice.  I bowed only once.  You got screwed.  The first one, I pointed at Jimmy like, no, it's all about you, my friend. 
[00:18:30]  And that was it.  They used the ridiculous bow instead.  Two awkward radio guys now on camera.  Oh, I know.  How do you do this?  That's what it is, too.  Duh.  This isn't like radio.  This has a picture.  I listen.  Dopes.  We're going to try to stay on track today.  We're just getting warmed up.  Bill Burr in studio for Jim Norton.  Jim Norton's going to be on the Tonight Show tomorrow night.  I see something in studio, Anthony.  You want to explain?  It's happening.  Huh?  Yes. 
[00:19:00]  The PalTalk cameras are in studio.  Here they are.  People are looking in right now as we speak on PalTalk.  You go there and we got cameras set up.  We got two of them so far on various parts of the studio.  They could actually hear what we're saying, you know, if we want them to.  Sometimes we shut the mic off when we're talking about, you know, personalized.  And yes, I do ban people from this because if they start yapping at me and sending me IMs,  they block the cameras. 
[00:19:30]  Now, you could see us, but we can also see you.  That's an important part, too, because people get involved with the program.  We had a guy take a stun gun to various parts of his body that are below his waist, let's just say.  His wife did that, and it was hysterical.  He flew right into a wall and put his head through the wall.  His wife stun gunned him.  And occasionally that stuff comes up.  People want to do things on camera.  But the girls also.  A lot of our favorite girls are on PalTalk. 
[00:20:00]  And we get to see them in various states of undress.  Reading.  Sometimes.  Sometimes they are just reading.  You forgot the guy that shot his gun in his apartment.  Yeah, sometimes people have shootouts.  You know, other stations have their shoutouts.  We do shootouts.  And they do it live on their cameras.  They'll blast their rifles out their windows if they live in the country.  This guy didn't quite live in the country, so he shot it through his floor.  It hit a plumbing pipe and flooded his basement, which is very funny.  But it just brings a new aspect of interaction to the program. 
[00:20:30]  We love it.  But when people IM me, sometimes a girl is doing something.  And a big, hey, what's up, man, pops up in front of the picture, makes me angry, and I then ban you.  So don't IM me.  All right.  Hey, I just saw something.  Can you see if Brian Wilson is talking on TV today?  I think the Beach Boys are getting back together.  They just showed Brian Wilson and the rest of the guys.  They're accepting something.  With champagne in their hands, and Brian Wilson had no clue what he was holding.  Yeah, the guy's lost.  I want to see if he had something to say today. 
[00:21:00]  All right, let's take our first break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Bill Burr sitting in for Jim Norton today and tomorrow, I believe, as well,  because Norton's going to be on Leno tomorrow night.  Make sure you check that out.  And Bill Burr is going to be at Caroline's all this weekend here in New York City.  Tickets are going to go fast for Bill Burr.  He's blowing up, man.  The number for Caroline's, if you're in the New York area, 212-757-4100. 
[00:21:30]  We should get into some things, some things.  It's a very busy news day.  A couple of things.  I have a nice observation.  There's a very, very scary story in the paper today.  It has to be the two front pages of the Daily News and the New York Post that you're talking about.  It has to be.  What, the knifing?  Very scary.  There's a lot of people getting knifed.  Yeah.  We know of three or four situations where people got knifed overnight. 
[00:22:00]  Knifed in the subway, twice in the subway, once down in Times Square.  Some guys just, well, this was, some tourist, this 21, 22-year-old guy and his girlfriend  were trying to get to Central Park on the subway, and they overshot the destination.  Ended up uptown.  A little horror when you realize you're on the middle track.  Yeah.  They're like, uh-oh.  They end up way uptown.  The train stops.  And we joke about this all the time on the show, but here's another example. 
[00:22:30]  Above 100th Street.  Above 100th.  That's what happened.  They ended up, uh-  So they want to stop at Central Park, so that could be anywhere from 59 to, uh, give it  up into the, uh, upper 80s.  Yeah, upper 80s.  Topps.  Any way you want to stop.  Well, they overshot the runway there and ended up way uptown.  The train stopped, and he was promptly stabbed in the chest.  It's a rule.  It is the rule. 
[00:23:00]  This poor bastard.  Weird.  He gets, uh, he thought he was just punched in the chest.  Guy walked up to him out of nowhere.  Guy didn't do anything, uh, and punched him in the chest.  So he walks off.  Allegedly.  And then notices, allegedly.  Allegedly definitely punched him in the chest.  And, uh, then he looks and he sees he's bleeding, gushing blood out of his chest, and it wasn't  a punch.  He was stabbed.  So he took him to the hospital, and he was in critical condition.  I guess he's getting better.  They're fixing him up, though.  So, and then, uh, somebody else got stabbed right down, uh, here at 50th. 
[00:23:30]  A couple blocks, right?  A couple blocks from here.  50th and 6th.  And then, uh, somebody else got stabbed in front of the W Hotel down there in Times Square.  They arrested a guy in that one, so they're trying to see if it's the same guy.  And some woman got stabbed in Central Park yesterday as well.  In Central Park.  But she was some kind of, she knew her attacker, and she was some kind of drug addict.  Drug addict.  She was asking.  Horrifying everybody.  She's, she's bleeding, uh, during, uh, the lunch hour while people are trying to sunbathe.  Oh, it was a nice day in Central Park yesterday.  And she's staggering around just bleeding.  She's ruining everyone's nice day by bleeding on them. 
[00:24:00]  Only in New York.  They probably thought she just fell down.  You know, like those drug addicts that were scraping their heads on the pavement.  Yeah, do you, if, if a homeless guy or drug addict that is walking down the street,  you see them every so often in New York.  It doesn't matter what they do.  Are you going to stop?  Oh, if they're bleeding, you don't want that anywhere on you.  I saw coming out of the subway when, uh, when I used to actually walk to the studio  instead of park my truck in front and run, flee into the building, because it got scary. 
[00:24:30]  This place gets scary at the hour we come in.  I'm sorry.  It's still dark out.  There are criminals roaming the street.  Ben almost got accosted, uh, this morning.  We know the ruses.  We know the clever ruses.  The ruses that happen out there.  Where's Ben?  Because his story is exactly what we talked about as well.  Get Ben in here, because this is what happens.  It doesn't happen if you're walking down the street.  It rarely happens out of the blue, where you'll, you'll just get, like, uh, uh, blindsided. 
[00:25:00]  The signs are always there.  The signs are there.  It's a ruse.  And they, they prey on your, um, maybe trying to help them.  That's, that's what it's all about.  Ben.  My guy this morning was, excuse me.  Uh, I'm, I'm lost.  Or something like that.  Or give me directions.  I don't even know.  Yeah, it's always that one.  Yeah, he wanted to, he tried to get my attention.  It's pitch black out.  It's 4.30.  It's 4.30 in the morning.  It's pitch black.  And somebody just out of nowhere, with one of his buddies kind of off to the side a little bit across the street, 
[00:25:30]  goes, excuse me, I'm lost.  That's hilarious.  And you're supposed to, like, now, if you're stupid, you walk up and go, oh, what are you trying to get?  Like, I'll help.  I'm a good guy.  And then you go, hmm.  And then you go.  I'm just laughing at that awful opening line.  That's like when you first start hitting on chicks in a bar.  Yeah.  So what's your sign?  Yeah, exactly.  That's the what's your sign of robbery.  You're like a mugger with no game.  But it's the same thing that happened.  Instead of not getting laid, he's like, just can't make it happen. 
[00:26:00]  Like all his buddies are like, you still using that one?  Dude, when's the last time you robbed somebody?  February.  I'm in a dry spell.  It's the same thing that happened to you.  What did the guy ask you for?  He asked you which way it was north.  Yeah, which way is north?  That's what I got.  It's like, it's pitch black out.  Here's Anthony's response.  It's the best.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  It's pitch black out.  I'm walking and a guy goes, yo, man, which way is north?  And I ran right into the middle of the street and just started going, no, don't even talk 
[00:26:30]  to him.  You get goddamn.  Yes.  I act like I'm crazy.  Act like a crazy person.  You kind of wail your arms around and just like shoo him away.  Kind of, don't even.  And you keep walking.  But in the middle of the street, because they try to get you close to the buildings.  Where they could throw you into an alley or a doorway or a phone booth or something.  You don't fall back on your mixed martial arts background?  Last resort. 
[00:27:00]  Only as a last resort.  Or they do the famous pop you in the head and you wake up here in Christmas.  Well, that's what it is.  If you then sit there, if you then, like at Ben, they asked him, you know, I'm lost.  You go, OK, maybe I'll help.  Boom.  And it's like, hey, well, OK, where are you trying to get?  I'm trying to get up to Times Square.  All right.  Well, and then when you turn around a little, like you go and like now he's to your side  because you're pointing.  You go up this way and you point up there.  Bam.  Yeah.  You get the Mike Tyson. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Boom.  And the next thing you hear is.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  And you're like, you slowly open your eyes and you're in the hospital and your loved ones  are.  And it was summer.  Right.  And there's cards all over the place.  Everything comes back into focus slowly.  And your mom or someone is going, doctor, doctor, doctor.  There's a Christmas.  Earl Ives is taking your blood pressure.  And you're going, why is it Christmas? 
[00:28:00]  It was just warm out.  I like the one where they go, you know what time it is?  So you look down and you catch the uppercut.  I always bring the watch up to like the eye level.  Oh, because if you duck your head down.  And you have a look at it.  Oh, don't duck your head down to the watch.  It's like 4 in the morning.  What time is it?  12 noon.  And you're just looking right at him.  At noon.  You don't even look down.  Don't look away.  Don't help people.  Anthony, here it is.  This is actually a good thing.  Here it is.  Here's what happens.  Yeah, which way is north? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, well, let me see.  It's right.  What?  What happened?  It was just summer.  Why?  Where have I been?  What's with all the balloons and cards in my room?  I didn't even go shopping.  I didn't shop.  Why is my family around me in winter clothes?  I remember someone asking me which way was north, and now it's Christmas.  Why is the nurse dressed as Santa's helper? 
[00:29:00]  Why aren't there mirrors in the room?  Why won't they let me look at a mirror?  Why can't I eat anything solid?  Why is there gum stuck to the back of my head?  Yeah.  So let's get back to Ben.  So what happened, Ben?  Nothing.  I ran into 6th Avenue.  Ran into 6th Avenue.  That's what you have to do.  That's Ben's advice.  He'll tell everybody.  If anyone approaches you that's shady and it's a little dark and you're in a weird neighborhood,  all you have to do is run in the middle of the street.  Run into the middle of the street because apparently Ben feels they're afraid of the road.  Well, they left me alone at that point. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  I got a taxi.  But you know what it is?  You know what I noticed?  It's a lot worse since the weather's getting warmer.  Yeah.  And they're out around the radio station.  This area is totally...  Yeah, this area is creepy.  57th is bad, but 56th, right on the other side of this building, is even worse.  Very scary.  Oh, you never want to be on a side street that doesn't have two-way traffic.  You want to have the big avenue.  Right.  79th.  You won't catch me off of 57th.  All right.  I'll never venture off of 57th before 6 a.m. 
[00:30:00]  25th, 116th.  All right, listen.  You don't want to be on 113th.  No.  So getting back to the New York Daily News and an interesting observation.  So you got the tourist that was stabbed uptown, okay?  And then you got Jerry Lewis has a minor heart attack.  Ah.  Minor heart attack.  God bless.  God bless.  That's on page two.  Thoughts and prayers out to Jerry Lewis.  Heart attack.  I hope he's okay.  Thoughts and prayers.  Everybody, give him a hand.  Give him a hand. 
[00:30:30]  I miss that guy's show.  Yeah, you keep believing in God out there.  You keep believing in God.  Here's a guy that spent, what, 30, 40 years of his life trying to do something with his life  and get a cure for muscular dystrophy.  Muscular dystrophy, a cure.  So thoughts and prayers out to him.  Hey, my daughter's graduating college.  Probably has raised over half a billion dollars for the cause.  Yeah.  And God just gives him the bloated face and the shakes and the minor heart attack and what  have you.  That's a test.  Huh?  He's testing you.  Of course he's testing. 
[00:31:00]  Of course.  Then I put it as a test.  So you got that up.  Can I have a written exam?  God, you're going to be testing me.  Can I go for the written exam?  So that's on page two.  I'm getting to something.  Trust me.  God's tests stink.  Then you got the Beach Boys.  Three of them appeared together and now there's rumors they might tour.  Now you're getting into some.  As opposed to putting out solo albums.  Now you're getting into some pretty unimportant news, Opie, right?  Right.  Well, that's page five, right?  Page five already.  And then you got W's Baghdad. 
[00:31:30]  Hello.  Yeah.  W flew in.  His surprise visit down there.  His surprise visit to Baghdad.  They got to talk about that because that Air Force One cruising over Baghdad must just  be.  Their mouths must water.  Their mouths must water though.  Where was my RPG?  Yeah.  Dude, come on.  Come on.  I swear Air Force One flew right over there.  Oh, sure it did.  No.  That's like you run out of quarters at the million dollar slot.  Right.  Like right before it's going to hit.  Yeah. 
[00:32:00]  You're shooting at some little frigging like security team, private, not even U.S.  Army.  Like the private security guys that are over there, helicopter.  You shoot it with your RPG.  And then right after that, Air Force One flies by.  Hola.  That's hilarious.  Damn, Allah.  I wasted my shot.  I wasted my shot.  It's like six in the morning.  They just start in the day.  They're like outside and it's like a sidewalk cafe and the thing comes by like 50 feet off  the ground.  Grab your RP. 
[00:32:30]  Ah!  Then he tells a story for the rest of his life in the local bar.  Yeah.  I was this close.  I was the one that got away.  Oh, yeah.  That's the guy who dropped the big touchdown pass.  Yeah.  He's like the Bill Buckner of the Middle East.  Of terrorists.  Right through his legs.  And then shut up.  And then Air Force One flew right over.  He was fought in the morning.  He's wearing his old Al-Qaeda jacket, sports jacket that he got.  The varsity jacket with like the last terrorist jacket going, I was this close, man. 
[00:33:00]  I was this close.  So that's on page.  I was in line to take over for Al-Zakawi.  So that's on page seven.  Page seven for that story.  Seven for that.  So they're saying the Beast Boy's more important and Jerry Lewis more important with his minor  heart attack, okay?  You get, trust me, there's an end here, okay?  Then you continue.  And then you got the lovely underpants ads for Macy's.  Big, huge page. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, this is very important if you're reading the paper.  You have to read the underpants ads.  Who dresses like that?  That's page 11, okay?  Adults, Bill.  You don't even have slacks.  I know.  I'm wearing jeans today.  I actually dressed like this knowing you were coming in.  I didn't wear any Boston clothes stuff.  Because you make fun of my clothes.  I even, like, sometimes I dress in, you know, buttoned down shirts and dockers or something.  And Bill makes fun of me.  And I just have to reiterate that they're called big boy clothes. 
[00:34:00]  Because he comes in with his Boston Red Sox everything on.  I really am a nerd.  You know what's funny about that?  I actually saw on Big A's MySpace page.  Yeah.  He's got a picture of me.  And I have a New England Patriots hooded sweatshirt and a New England Patriots hat.  I look like I won a contest.  All right.  The seventh caller.  Wait a minute.  He's trying to get to something.  Well, no.  Just before we get to the break.  So then page 10, you've got a police officer that was this close to dying when a 500-pound limp fell from a tree. 
[00:34:30]  So that's an important story for the Daily News today.  You keep going.  You keep going.  You keep going.  There's ads for barbecues for Father's Day.  A whole page dedicated to that.  Very important.  All right.  You keep going.  You keep going.  Finally, on page 23 of the Daily News.  23, there could be no useful news.  There's no news that you really need to know on page.  And it's someone's job at the New York Daily News to get all the stories and decide what's the most important story,  and you throw that on the front page.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  And then the other ones that are kind of important, you throw early on in the paper, right?  Mm-hmm.  Someone at the Daily News decided this story is not that important and it should be on page 23.  Okay.  The headline, Earth's Days Are Numbered.  Now, right there, it kind of catches your eye.  That sounds like a single-digit story to me.  Yeah.  Days are numbered, Earth.  Page 23.  We don't really have many options right now.  Page 23.  To Earth.  Page 23.  Page 23. 
[00:35:30]  Now you might ask yourself, well, obviously a homeless guy said this, so why take him seriously?  Some nut.  So we'll just throw this on page 23.  Yeah.  No, Stephen Hawkins is telling everybody the Earth's days are numbered.  You mean the smartest guy on the planet?  The smartest guy in the universe, speaking of God.  Yeah.  The smartest guy in the universe, he can't communicate, and you don't think God has a sense of humor if he's out there, because now I'm contradicting myself here. 
[00:36:00]  What's on page 24?  Asteroid to hit tomorrow?  Yeah, exactly.  Earth's days are numbered.  Earth's days are numbered.  Okay.  Page 23.  He would have told us more, too, but it took him all day just to say that.  So he couldn't give us many details.  Poor bastard.  Paris Hilton's on page 3.  Still arguing with Nicole Richie.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How are they going to do the show if they don't like each other?  Yeah, well.  Oh, my God.  Earth's days are numbered. 
[00:36:30]  Why are you talking about Paris Hilton?  Somebody please listen to me.  Earth's days.  Numbered?  Earth's days are numbered.  Speaking of numbered, what number did The Omen come in on its opening on Tuesday?  Oh, my God, you idiots.  I am brilliant.  Earth's days are numbered.  There's going to be no movie theater.  Yeah.  There will be no movies ever again. 
[00:37:00]  We need to build moon bases.  That's what he's basically saying.  We've got to get off Earth within, like, 40 years, or at least have the option to get off Earth in 40 years.  And the first thing every party does is you do the selfish math.  Okay, in 40 years, I'll be in my 70s.  Yeah, and speaking of out of this world, Brangelina's baby is just out of this world adorable.  Oh, my God, you idiots.  Don't you understand?  Days are numbered.  Speaking of that, the daily number.  The daily number is for today. 
[00:37:30]  728.  All you lucky winners.  I would shoot myself if I could.  Omen, number one shot.  So this is what Stephen Hawking's had to say, and I'm assuming it took him at least a week just to say this.  Yeah.  Humans must establish a base on the moon and colonize Mars within the next 40 years if we're to avoid extinction from global warming or another catastrophe astrophysicist.  Catastrophe?  Catastrophic.  No, it just says catastrophe. 
[00:38:00]  Catastrophe, maybe?  Or catastrophe.  Oh, catastrophe, sorry.  Catastrophe.  It's early.  It's catastrophe.  Says Stephen Hawking, it is important for the human race to spread out into space for the survival of the species, Hawking said, at a news conference in Hong Kong.  Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster, such as sudden global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus, or other dangers we have not yet thought of.  He said that in Hong Kong?  That means, like, the translator was signing, like, Godzilla. 
[00:38:30]  The world is going to end.  So, yeah, Godzilla.  We've got to go to Mars.  That's our only option at this point?  Yeah, we can't stop anything that's going to happen.  But the beauty is, the point, Daily News thought it was important enough to be on page 23.  23.  Mars guy in the world has decided to finally tell us something, and we don't even pay attention to it.  This story was more important.  This was on page 4, I believe.  Britney Spears, eww, and they spell out eww. 
[00:39:00]  Eww factors.  Apparently on the rise, the pregnant Pop-Tart did more than just pick up a few pink thongs at the Victoria's Secret in California.  According to Us Weekly, she got down on the floor next to the cash register and changed nine-month-old Sean Preston's dirty diaper.  Britney then tried to hand it to an employee, says a source.  The salesperson wouldn't take it.  Of course.  Why the hell was she?  And it goes on.  But that's more important than Stephen Hawking saying Earth's days are numbered. 
[00:39:30]  Okay.  Isn't that why the Earth's days are numbered?  The celebrities continuing to buy more stuff?  Yes, that's got to be it.  Yeah.  The SUVs.  Buying all these thongs.  Oh, not even the SUVs.  Do you think she needs more thongs?  How many trees were killed to make those thongs, Anthony?  Probably none.  I would think none.  Not many trees being used in the production of thongs, I don't think.  We've got a steam turbine running the thong factory. 
[00:40:00]  By the way.  So you think the end of the world isn't going to come?  No.  No, I'm not one of those.  Let's go to Paul in Jersey.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Paul.  Why is it that Stephen Hawking had less difficulty saying that line than Opie did?  He was really tripping up, too.  You messed up on something.  What else did I mess up on there?  The.  It is Stephen Hawking.  I know.  We are in for a catastrophe.  A catastrophe.  It's not catastrophe?  Catastrophe.  No, it's spelled catastrophe. 
[00:40:30]  Catastrophe.  I read that same word at noon.  It comes out nice.  It comes out real nice.  You're that kid in elementary school.  You were like sweating bullets when it was your turn to read out loud.  Oh, I'm a good reader.  Jack and Jill went up the high hill.  I hate when they picked that kid to read because you're just sitting there going, come on already.  The big engine. 
[00:41:00]  You read it, teacher.  I'm sick of this babbling idiot.  Yeah, just go send him down to the textile mill.  Yeah, that's where he's going to end up.  Start wrapping that big spool, buddy.  With rayon.  Or he becomes a popular DJ.  Text.  Wait a minute.  Or a comedian.  Listen to me being all arrogant.  You should see my high school grades.  Horrific.  I didn't graduate, so who am I talking?  Who am I talking?  This early, the brain.  See? 
[00:41:30]  Who am I talking?  This early, the brain just doesn't work as well.  It's amazing.  Who are you kidding?  No, I'm telling you.  Follow me around today.  I'll read all the signs for you.  What?  Watch me.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break.  Bill Burns Studio.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We've got brand new Mantown sweepers.  Mantown.  The entire country is into this whole Mantown thing.  No, they're not.  That we started on.  Only, at most, 10%.  And we'll talk about the Opie and Anthony traveling virus comedy tour and other things on the way. 
[00:42:00]  That's actually really good, Bill.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  And don't forget, we announced this yesterday.  This is really cool, and the newspapers are picking up on it.  We're getting mentions in a bunch of papers today.  The websites have all the info. 
[00:42:30]  We're talking about Opie and Anthony's traveling virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  And Bill Burr, who is sitting in for Jim Norton today, he's going to be one of the many comedians featured.  One of the featured players.  Yeah, thank you.  Exactly.  So far, we've got three dates.  For this catastrophe of comedy tour.  Catastrophe!  Catastrophe of comedy.  I looked at that word, and I went, I've never seen this word before in my life.  I don't know. 
[00:43:00]  Oh my God, how do I tackle this word?  I saw compromise once and said compromise.  Compromise?  Compromise.  What's a compromise?  Why are these people compromising?  Yeah, then once you mess it up, you just can't.  You can't see the word.  You can't see it the other way, right?  Can't see it.  You're just an idiot.  All through the break, I'm like, it was obviously catastrophe.  What's wrong with you?  And then in school, when we were learning about Europe, I had to read out of the book like  we were talking earlier, and I said, E-rope, E-rope, instead of Europe. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I pronounced it E-rope.  Because you know what happens?  And that was when I decided to leave high school.  They just drag you down to shop class?  What do you want?  Here you go.  What a medal, buddy.  This is a lathe.  We got a place for you.  Watch your fingers.  We got a place for you.  Exactly.  I'm sorry.  Your fingers are stupid.  You know what it is, though?  You get into a groove where you start reading things, and you're not really paying attention  to what you're reading.  So then when the word comes up, you're like, ooh, this one threw me. 
[00:44:00]  Can we stick to all the ones I just know by heart?  So real fast, Opie and Anthony's Traveling Fires, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  We got three dates so far.  We might add some more dates.  They're bitching in Washington, and I don't blame them.  I think we could take this tour to Washington today, and we would do great numbers down  there in D.C.  Tickets go on sale Friday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  The three dates, Saturday, August 5th in Worcester, Mass at the DCU Center, Saturday, August 26th 
[00:44:30]  at the PNC Banks Art Center in Jersey.  What city is that in in New Jersey?  Homedale.  Jesus Christ, you guys are hitting all the big cities here.  Saturday, September 9th, Camden, New Jersey, the murder capital of the country.  Why play Philly when you can go to Camden?  At the Tweeter Center.  Well, it's just across the river there, Bill.  Right across the river.  How many people have you guys pissed off?  This is what you guys are left?  It's all the cities. 
[00:45:00]  You don't even have Albany here.  I mean, come on.  That's the capital of New York.  Could you at least get one capital?  See, no one wants us to really talk about this, but I will.  Then we got Harrisburg, Pennsylvania coming up.  Right.  We wanted to play Boston, but there's a mayor up there that's holding grudges still.  And there's things that need to be done to bring your tour to Boston.  Right.  You need to have a sit-down.  And he's not signing off on any of these things, so we had to go all the way out to Worcester. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, we need a sit-down or something.  You mean man-town?  Man-town.  We're going to be in the heart of man-town.  Man-town.  But we did want to play Boston, but there's a little issue with the mayor still, eight years later.  Eight years later.  And then we pissed off everybody here in New York City, so the closest we got is PNC.  That's a nice man-town.  PNC will go there.  Yeah.  And then Camden, New Jersey, the murder capital of the entire world, I think.  Yeah.  It's up there.  Also, we're going to do the Plaza of Perversion. 
[00:46:00]  We don't know what that means yet, but we're going to figure it out.  This looks like a schedule for, like, arena football.  Oh, my God.  For the CBA.  Exactly.  For the CBA.

[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  I've actually, what do I always do?  I do Rutgers.  Oh, yeah?  Camden.  Oh, it's hilarious.  It's this nice little school next to, like, the set of Escape from New York.  That bad?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you want to talk about walking up the middle of the street?  You have to, like, walk up the middle of the street with, like, ripped jeans and, like,  the sawed-off shotgun, like, on your shoulder.  Over your shoulder.  Yeah.  You've got to have, like, a patch.  It's the only way people might not bug you.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Even then.  Yeah.  At least somebody's going to be like, you know what time it is? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yo, what time is it?  Oh, God, now I've got to shoot you.  Let's say hi to Mark at Long Island.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, ONA?  Hey.  Big fan of the show, guys.  I've been listening to you on XM for a long time now.  You guys are, I thank God that you guys are around in the morning.  Oh, cool.  Thanks, bro.  God.  You guys should definitely try and get out to Long Island.  You guys have a huge fan base on Long Island.  You guys know you guys are killing Long Island.  Well, we're from Long Island.  You know, we'll see how these dates sell, and then I think we're going to add a few more.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we'll see. 
[00:49:00]  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  We want to just take this out slowly and see where we're at.  That's all.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  But I would love to take this to Long Island.  Are you kidding me?  Our backyard.  At this point, we're just at centers.  We're trying to get to arenas.  Right.  Exactly.  We're at the centers.  We're doing the center tour.  Tweeter?  I didn't know they were still in business.  Of course they are.  They're taking over the world.  Tweeter centers all over the place.  Danny in Virginia Beach.  Hey, guys. 
[00:49:30]  Hey.  Hey.  We're having this stupid tropical depression come through here, which is no news at all.  But the radio bit of the day down here for the top guys is there's a guy dressed up in a tampon suit.  The chest testing.  Exactly.  And he's there to.  Come out here, guys.  I'm coming to you guys.  I'm on my way to Albany.  Wait.  What's the name of the show that's doing this bit?  They should get credit for this clever bit.  This is Tommy and Rumble on FM 99 WNOR. 
[00:50:00]  Tommy and Rumble?  Ugh.  So what?  They got their.  Who's in the tampon suit?  Tommy or Rumble or their stunt guy?  No.  It's called Stunt Boy.  Stunt Boy.  Every morning show has to have a stunt boy.  Ugh.  And they sent him out on the street to do some crazy things.  Today, you know, it's a giant-sized tampon in the rain.  Ugh.  Can you believe it?  We have a giant-sized tampon out there in the rain today.  Is this just hysterical funny?  Yeah.  Play it out.  Yeah.  A tampon guy.  What's happening out there? 
[00:50:30]  Well, it's pretty wet out here.  It's raining.  Of course, I got the remnants of Tropical Storm Alberto.  And I'm in a tampon suit.  Tampon suit?  Dude, that's outrageous.  We'll be back.  I bet you they're not even smart enough to take a, you know, a can of red paint and throw  it on the guy.  And not even tell him that it's going to happen.  A tampon guy.  How you doing out there?  Uh, great, great.  Uh, look at me swell.  I'm just swelling up to a huge size now.  Because that's what happens.  Ah, swelling. 
[00:51:00]  For the tampon.  What else can you tell us, tampon man?  I don't know.  Somebody's stepping on my string.  I can't move.  Yeah, I can't play that out in any fashion.  That would be entertaining or funny.  Get some spaghetti sauce and throw it on tampon, dude.  Well, you can just shoot him.  Yeah, that's an option.  Brian in Philly.  Funnier.  Brian.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Brian.  Hey, first off, I want to call out Bill Burr.  You said they couldn't play any dates in Capitals. 
[00:51:30]  Then you said they were coming to Harrisburg, which is clearly the capital of PA.  What was the joke?  We're not really there.  All right.  Well, more importantly, I want to know if I can...  Wait a minute.  You just said you were calling me out.  Hold on a minute.  Yeah, you called out Bill, and he's calling you out back.  You didn't get the joke, so it's not more importantly.  I think you owe me an apology.  More importantly than me being an idiot.  First of all, you said two plus two is four.  It's five.  No, it's actually four.  Well, more importantly...  He just wrote that off as being nothing. 
[00:52:00]  I'm going to use that.  I like that.  That is good.  That's a good way to get out of an argument.  Why did you shoot on me?  More importantly...  More importantly, then, I want to know if...  When the tickets go on sale, can I buy the old seat, or will I owe me the edge?  That's good.  Thanks, Brian.  I love that gag.  I'll touch it out.  By the way, Bill Burr, nice observation.  Because now I'm thinking...  Because now people are bitching that we're not going to Buffalo.  We're not allowed back in Buffalo.  What did you do?  We almost got arrested in Buffalo, too. 
[00:52:30]  We had a little beach party in Buffalo.  We had a little lesbian beach party.  And believe it or not, that was something that Infinity Broadcasting at the time was investigating  when we got fired.  So they kind of...  The Sex for Sam thing was more importantly than the Buffalo thing.  Which was really gearing up to be something bad.  It was gearing up to be the end of our careers, but we're not...  We had something already in the works to get us fired when we got fired.  Yeah.  The authorities in Buffalo, they were talking about getting us arrested. 
[00:53:00]  Oh, it was ugly, man.  And this wasn't even broadcast.  This was done on a weekend.  It was a gig that we did.  It was going to be a bar gig where we had a...  It was a T&A with O&A.  Well, I'll tell you what...  Was there a pool table involved?  Well, pretty much.  Hold on, hold on.  Really fast.  Yeah.  Because we're on in a lot of cities right now.  And Pittsburgh is begging us to go to Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  And I was telling Ben yesterday on the phone, I'm like, Ben, we got to get something going  on before we go to Pittsburgh, right?  Because we can't just go to a city because you know what's going to happen is it's going 
[00:53:30]  to be another Buffalo incident.  Yeah.  Because Buffalo begged and begged and begged and we go, all right, we'll go to Buffalo.  We know we have a lot of fans up there.  We're like, what's the idea?  And they're like, well, we're going to just have, you know, girls from strip clubs and  they're just going to play volleyball.  It's going to be a nice sunny day.  And you guys come up and, and you just talk to the crowd and people call it T and A with  O and A T and A with O and A. And, uh, you know, there'll be drinking beer and, uh, it'll  be a little beach party.  No big deal.  Strippers in their bikinis playing a volleyball so people can gawk.  And that was the final idea. 
[00:54:00]  This wasn't just like, yeah, that was pretty much it.  They had t-shirts made and stuff.  So we get there and, uh, we're driving up to the venue.  It's like a, it's like a beach bar and the traffic is backed up for miles.  And Anthony and I just clueless where we are in our careers.  Like, great, we're going to be late to this.  What the hell's going on over here?  Like some concert or another beach?  Yeah.  Beach bar.  What's going on up here that, you know, we got to sit in this traffic.  And it turned out they were all going to this event.  They were expecting, honestly, they were probably expecting a couple hundred people, right? 
[00:54:30]  There was well over a thousand, well over a thousand.  Everyone drinking their faces off.  We get in front of the crowd.  They just want to see someone die.  Yeah.  They didn't care.  That's the only way to explain it.  They wanted a spectacle.  They wanted, like, the Roman Coliseum.  You went into crowd-pleasing mode?  Yep.  That's exactly what we did.  Yeah, because that's what you got to do.  Because they're looking at it like, wow, the big shock jocks from New York, they're finally  making it to Buffalo.  And we explain what's going to happen with the girls playing volleyball, you know, from  the strip clubs. 
[00:55:00]  And within 30 seconds, the girls decide to just get completely naked.  Not even a little tease and like, well, look what I got, boys.  They all just decide to take all their clothes off.  The place goes nuts.  Now, this doesn't sound like a real problem until you realize where we were.  We were at a bar, but it was a beach bar.  So it opened up to a public beach.  With families walking by.  There were families on a lovely Saturday afternoon.  But it was okay because they had our portion of the beach kind of roped off. 
[00:55:30]  Kind of.  But you could still see all the actors.  It was such a small area that was roped off because they weren't expecting that many people  that it didn't even matter.  It was like the volleyball court was roped off.  So there's drunk, completely naked strippers trying to play volleyball for three seconds  until they figured it would be more entertaining for the crowd, because they're crowd pleasers  too, to just start doing everything with each other on the public beach with families watching. 
[00:56:00]  And I mean everything.  At one point, I guess because the bar was also a restaurant, somebody came up with various  vegetables and threw them to the girls.  Cucumbers, zucchinis, squash.  Why would you do that?  Oh, who knows?  We worked up to the zucchini.  It started out with a cute little carrot.  But then the girls, you know, they're competitive.  They're very competitive.  They don't want to be showed up by this whore.  Oh, my God.  So it and just it was families running, gathering up their kids, putting towels over their faces. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah, just leave like fleeing the beach.  And the people that were there for the show were just like whipped into a frenzy.  Guys.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And everyone had their video cameras.  There's so much video and video and still pictures still on the Internet.  That arrive that.  Yeah.  That I they are right up there with any type of smut you could download on the Internet 
[00:57:00]  today.  Now, at any point, are you guys thinking while this is going on, like, hey, we might want  to pull this back a little bit.  No, it was out of our control.  It was totally out of our control.  We would have been hung up like Mussolini.  That's right.  It was one of those things where we just had to go with it.  That probably would have been the kiss of death.  Ladies, ladies, could you put your clothes back on?  Excuse me, listeners.  Yeah.  Hey, listeners.  You know, just disrespectful to the people on. 
[00:57:30]  And we would have been like we would have been using the zucchini.  Hey, man, we're all for this wild thing.  But this is taking a little too far.  Don't you think, guys?  Is it?  No.  Girls were having sex with each other right in the sand.  It was just unbelievable.  It was a spectacle.  So then the news crews showed up after we left town and the owner of the place in trouble.  The owner of the place kept coming up to us going, guys, this is the most amazing, biggest thing.  I've sold more beer in an hour than I've sold at any other event during the entire event. 
[00:58:00]  They were selling warm beer.  And it was a really hot day.  I think it was close to 90 that day.  So, I mean, you want to talk about warm beer.  It was room temperature.  And these guys did not care.  Because they ran out of cold beer.  Yeah, they ran out of cold beer.  So they're just slamming back warm beer.  And then, yeah, he's thanking us.  And it was the greatest day since he's been open.  Oh, he pocketed so much cash.  It's a success.  Success.  Slapping each other on the back.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:58:30]  We leave town, and then all of a sudden the newspapers and the TV stations start circling and circling.  Live sex on a public beach.  Feet away from children.  Children.  We'll talk to this mother who had to flee the beach with her children because women were having sex on the beach.  Oh, no.  Picture this, if you will.  Yeah, picture, and then you get the, it's all because of a radio show called The Opioid Anthem. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, no.  Then I'm watching, and I go, okay, here it is.  Here it is.  Oh, we're screwed.  And then the lawyers are calling us behind the scenes saying, you know, they're trying to figure out how to get you guys arrested and drag you back.  They were talking about FCC complaints.  Even though we weren't on the radio.  We weren't on the air.  How do you file a complaint?  People filed FCC complaints when we weren't even broadcasting.  It was amazing how filthy this was.  It wasn't your idea for them to get naked. 
[00:59:30]  You're not on the radio.  How does it come back to you?  Exactly.  Because it was our event.  It was an Opioid Anthony event.  Right.  We had Opioid Anthony event goes horribly wrong in Buffalo.  Goes horribly right.  So, and then someone's calling us out saying, you guys are hypocrites.  Why?  Went to the XM radio promotional tour or whatever.  You guys made it to Buffalo.  Absolutely.  We did.  Under the radar, very quietly.  Oh, yeah.  That's not being a hypocrite. 
[01:00:00]  I mean, just go with it, Buffalo.  That doesn't fit the hypocrite.  Being a hypocrite.  Then we were like, that just makes you a liar.  More importantly, you got the root word wrong.  Is that like the, just like the word everybody uses?  Hypocrite.  Hypocrite.  Because we're sort of joking saying we can't go back to Buffalo.  I think we could.  Yeah.  I ordered mayo on this sandwich.  You put on mustard, you hypocrite.  More importantly, it's on wheat bread. 
[01:00:30]  Perhaps the guy was talking about how much he loves mustard.  Right.  And then he puts mayo on the sandwich that's a little hypocritical.  Or how he would never use mayo.  I don't know.  Let's say.  That was the most difficult example to try to get some sort of hypocrisy.  Of course it was.  Condiments.  Let's say hi to.  It's like if you had relish.  Wait a second.  No.  No.  That would be ironic.  Wait a minute.  Let's say hi to Jim in Buffalo. 
[01:01:00]  Jim, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey, Dad, Jim.  What's going on?  Hey, best day of my life.  That was unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  We hear from people all the time saying that was the best day of their life.  Best time.  Most memorable thing they've ever gone to.  And on the other side, the most difficult day as a parent.  Yes.  We're about 500 couples.  Jim, what did we forget?  The whipped cream bikini contest.  The beach volleyball contest.  It just turned into lesbian sex on the beach.  I knew it was a good day when I pulled up. 
[01:01:30]  This car in front of me smashed up.  They were so drunk.  They hit a pole, backed up, and drove to the event.  Yeah, there were wrecked cars pulling in because they were drunk getting to the event.  We're not exaggerating on any level.  This thing was so out of control.  It was the most out of control, not even event, thing I've ever been to.  It was so out of hand.  At any time, someone could have died.  It was just that feeling you had in the air.  No, it was basically a typical O&A live event.  Right.  And then someone's reminding us of past road shows.  Yes, we did this many, many times. 
[01:02:00]  Keep it up, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  It was like my second time on this show was the Hard Rock Cafe, St. Patrick's Day.  Oh, God.  What an impression you got.  Oh, yeah.  It was like a, I don't know.  It was like a Klan rally, frat party.  I didn't know what was going on.  Yeah.  If there were women there, there would have been a rape.  Yeah, exactly.  It was all just the guys.  It was St. Paddy's Day, and we had a great idea to tell your cute St. Paddy's Day jokes  at the end of our broadcast.  Yeah.  And all these guys lined up completely hammered. 
[01:02:30]  Bill Burr, we barely know him.  And one after another, they had their best black joke.  Within three jokes.  Like, at first, it was, you know.  And as always, nobody policing the situation.  Nobody going, hey, take it down a little bit.  Do you understand our position?  We can't be the guys that all of a sudden go, hey, guys, the black jokes.  We got to knock it off.  They would kill us.  Because that would be hypocritical.  We were such hypocrites.  They would kill us.  Yeah, like the first two jokes, I think, were like, you know, an Irishman walks into a bar. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  And it's like, okay, it's St. Pat's.  This sounds cool.  Right.  And it just slowly turned into nothing but black jokes.  Yeah, and I was just in my head.  And they got worse and worse.  The language.  They were horrific.  I needed to bathe after that show.  Yeah, it was really bad.  Yeah, and that was the highlight of that show, was with the guy that won a radio.  Yeah.  By relieving himself.  Which was a catastrophe.  Yeah, it was a catastrophe. 
[01:03:30]  He was on stage, fully clothed.  And somebody was trying to tell us not to do it.  He drank a lot of beer, so he was very full.  Go work for a morning zoo radio program.  And right on stage, in front of a crowd of people, you just saw his pants get darker.  And the place went nuts.  And the place went nuts.  That's all it takes.  The place went nuts.  That's all it takes.  Alex in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Just want to remind you guys about the Asbury Park road trip that you guys did.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Beirut.  How crazy that was.  You guys had naked women on the stage.  You had a lesbian pool in front of the stage with girls totally making out.  Right.  Well.  Cat fighting.  Yeah.  You guys had a...  Cat fighting and Dickie Betts doing a solo hours after he beat up his wife in a hotel.  Allegedly.  Allegedly pretty definite.  I like Dickie Betts, man.  That guy draws a line and he sticks to it.  Dickie Betts was... 
[01:04:30]  All right, Alex.  He was actually supposed to come up and maybe jam a little on stage during the time we were  there because he was playing the Stone Pony that night.  And he didn't show up.  No one could find him.  So his guys came back to us.  And we were like, where's Dickie?  He's like, oh, there's trouble.  The cops are over there.  It's like, what happened?  It's like, apparently Dickie, you know, got in a fight with his wife again.  That happens a lot.  He goes, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  So, yeah.  Allegedly, Dickie had spent the day in a fight with his wife and maybe smacking her a little 
[01:05:00]  bit.  Yeah, we don't know.  We don't know.  I don't know.  We opened her yap.  I'm joking.  We insulted his brilliant guitar playing.  She was obviously mouthing off.  Why did you play that song that way?  You know, how many times I got to tell you no opinions?  All right, listen, we got to take a break.  We're getting late here.  So we'll come back and do some other things.  Oh, we were supposed to do the Mantown. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, well, thank God we got more show.  BCN is so motivated as far as this show goes.  And they're really into this Mantown concept and how awful it is.  And we talked about Mantown last week, and now they've made more promos about how awful  Mantown is.  So we got those in front of us.  It's the basis of a radio show up there.  Yeah, we'll explain next.  And I think today, because Bill Burr has never sat in when we did this, news teases today.  Oh, I love the news teases.  We haven't done it in a while.  More fear mongering.  We'll get into news teases as well.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:06:00]  Those men wanted to have sex with me.  Mantown.  By the way, someone is writing on the instant feedback.  You guys were too busy writing down the black jokes to stop them.  Oh, well, that might have been.  And then Matt in Jersey City, you guys are such hypocrites, whatever that means. 
[01:06:30]  I don't know at this point.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bill Burr in studio.  Sitting in for Jim Norton for the next couple of days.  Jim Norton's out there in L.A.  He's doing Leno tomorrow night.  Hey, make sure you check it out.  It's, I think, his fourth appearance on Leno.  That's really, really cool for Jimmy.  And Bill Burr's going to be at Caroline's all this weekend here in New York City.  Tickets are going fast, Bill.  The phone number, 212-757-4100 to see Bill Burr, Caroline's.  All right?  Right.  All right.  They're reminding us that we've got to talk about Mantown.  I wish I knew how to quit you. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, we're back on in Boston.  That's just always funny.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  We started at WAF back in the day, and then we were syndicated to WBCN.  Then we got fired, and now we're back on WBCN.  Right.  We're going to try to hang out for a while, guys.  Like, Boston at this point is like, oh, great.  How long is this going to last?  Four months, maybe?  Three times.  Did you guys try to keep your jobs, please? 
[01:07:30]  It's our third time back.  So we're very excited to be on WBCN.  We've noticed that there's some drastic changes as far as WBCN goes.  The last time we were on WBCN, you know, it was a heritage station, and they had Howard,  and things were just a well-oiled machine.  So they kind of just hung back and just kind of watched everything happen,  in my humble opinion, Anthony.  And they're back to working really, really hard, and they got an edge.  They got an edge to them.  They got this guy, Dave Wellington, who's running the station up there. 
[01:08:00]  And the guy gets the Opie and Anthony show, and he's motivated,  and he loves when we make fun of Mantown and our old station up there.  And they're making promos like crazy.  You want to explain the Mantown concept?  Well, all I could really get, I don't think I really completely understand it,  but I guess the Hillman over there doing mornings at AAF has this thing,  him and his crew, that's called Mantown. 
[01:08:30]  And they're very proud of this.  Very proud of it.  It's a big part of their program, I guess.  This is the only thing they talk about every morning.  Yeah.  This is it.  It's like Mantown.  This is what you get from their show.  And it's like where guys can go and just be guys.  Isn't it that town down on the Cape?  Yeah.  I think there's one there.  There's one there.  That's Mantown.  That's very much Mantown.  But, like, I think it's trying to be presented as the place where if you're some married slob. 
[01:09:00]  Where men can be men.  Men.  And your wife has emasculated you.  Like, it's like your basement with the TV and your friends can come over if your wife allows it.  And you can act like you really still have what it takes to be a man.  Yeah.  It's an illusion of masculinity is what I've figured out that this is.  But some people have a garage set up where the guy goes, yeah, this is my space.  It's where I go to get away from the little woman. 
[01:09:30]  From the broad.  From the broad.  And meanwhile, she runs the entire show.  If she poked her head and said, turn that off and take out the goddamn garbage, he'd be running to do it.  But he considers that his space.  And they all, I guess, have this space at their various houses and assume that every other guy does.  And they've called it Mantown.  And the rest of the country and the XM Nation really into the Mantown thing. 
[01:10:00]  It reeks of bad beer commercial.  Right, right.  If this were guys, this was a guy's world.  This would be guy's world 24-7.  Yeah.  Roll a hockey.  It's trying a little too hard to appeal to the regular guy.  They're making this way too easy for us.  So it's either that or just extremely gay.  Where, you know, you take it literally.  Mantown.  Howl.  Hey, can I go to the answer feedback? 
[01:10:30]  Steven in Bayshore.  Mantown, where they take your temperature the old-fashioned way.  You got to wear that Freddie Mercury tank top where your shoulder blades are totally exposed.  You all got to grow a Mantown mustache.  Big 70s porno mustache.  Oh, just to hide the fact that you're looking for.  Isn't that horrible?  I can't say it.  Let's go to Mike on Long Island.  It just, it like reeks of trying too hard. 
[01:11:00]  It's awful.  Mike, what's up?  All right.  I heard the main export of Mantown is packing fudge.  Yes.  Their main export, a lot of cities have an export.  It's fudge, yeah.  See, they're loving it in Boston, but I'm telling you, they're loving it everywhere else.  That's a call from Long Island.  Steve's from Long Island with his comment on the instant feedback.  Now you got Brian in Philly.  Brian, what's up?  Yo, more importantly, I want to say that even the city of brotherly love thinks Mantown's a bunch of queers.  The city of brotherly love also hates Mantown. 
[01:11:30]  I'm kind of digging the more importantly thing.  I'm going to use that all the time now.  More importantly.  More importantly, let's dismiss the wrongness I just had for something more important.  George Bush got to use that one.  There was no weapons of mass destruction.  More importantly, we're bringing freedom to Iraq.  Steven from Bayshore is on fire today.  Man-Town, where it's never mayo in your beard. 
[01:12:00]  Man-Town.  Somebody from a mobile device.  Isn't Man-Town where Vito disappeared, too, on The Sopranos?  Yeah.  Get your Johnny Cakes at Man-Town.  It's going to be a gay IHOP.  Come on down to Man-Town for steaks and eggs.  Man-Town.  Can I go to Man-Town with you?  I want some Johnny Cakes.  Lots of syrup.  We'll be serving up the sausage in Man-Town. 
[01:12:30]  Bet you will.  Pigs in a blanket.  Pigs in a blanket.  Nice, thick, and juicy.  No ladies allowed.  This is Man-Town.  Man-Town.  That sounds like a musical.  A big gay Broadway musical.  Something like that.  Boys Town or Man-Town.  So they love when we talk about Man-Town in Boston.  Then BCN takes our audio and they make promos that run all the time. 
[01:13:00]  All the time.  Because the Hillman is running scared up there in Worcester.  Well, you put him in an awkward position because now it's like he can't just take it off the air.  No.  Because he looks like he loses.  But you're hitting it at the base level of a guy.  Yeah.  It's a very difficult situation.  So his only move is to try to make it cool.  Good luck with that.  Impossible.  Good luck with that.  First of all, it's impossible.  More importantly, it's impossible.  Yeah, you don't want to pull it off because then it looks like we were right. 
[01:13:30]  So you want to kind of...  But you feel embarrassed now promoting it, don't you?  Man-Town, I'm just picturing them in like half shirts playing flag football.  Gotcha.  Those little orange cones.  I gotcha.  I pulled your flag.  You certainly did.  Tackle football?  Man-Town.  Just picturing the volleyball scene from Top Gun every time they bring up Man-Town.  You know, every once in a while we let a call through with an inside joke and then there's 
[01:14:00]  people out there that get it and everyone else goes, huh?  Huh?  Yeah.  This is one of those moments.  Matt in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, I heard Mark Perrino has a hit radio show in Man-Town.  Mark Perrino.  Hey, you want a PlayStation?  Mike used to be a DJ up there.  Mark fell into a little trouble giving PlayStations to young boys in exchange for, well...  But his heart was in the right place.  He gets out in November?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  XM going to bring him back? 
[01:14:30]  All right, so you want to...  XM Kids?  You want to hear some of these promos?  Yeah, let's hear what they put together in Boston at BCN for us using our Man-Town break.  Opie and Anthony.  I guess the big thing with their show is, uh, Man-Town.  Mornings on WBCN.  They have a concept called Man-Town.  They're raising the bar.  Who the hell would want to hang out in Man-Town?  I want to hang out in Slut-Town.  Right.  And bringing it down hard on...  Hey, Worcester.  You get the picture.  How you doing?  You're not even a real Boston station. 
[01:15:00]  We can't even hear you in Boston.  Opie and Anthony, weekday mornings at 6 on The Rock of Boston, 104.1.  Exactly.  WBCN.  Oof.  And the whole thing with them not having a signal in Boston.  Oh, God.  And that's something we know bothers them, because it bothered us when we were there.  It bugged me when I lived there.  I used to like the station.  Yeah.  But if you weren't on 495, you couldn't hear it.  You couldn't hear it. 
[01:15:30]  And we just were, like, constantly arguing.  And Brucey Mittman, who ran the station back then, was constantly going, uh, boys, we're working on getting a stick in Boston.  We're working on an upgrade.  We're working on an upgrade to the transmitter.  They're readjusting the transmitter.  They're facing it where...  See, let me draw you a diagram of how this...  Could you just figure it out?  Because we can't be heard in half of Boston.  We've been gone for eight years from that station, and they're still saying that any day now.  Any day.  Even though he doesn't work there anymore. 
[01:16:00]  Out here in Mantown.  Mantown gets a full signal.  We just knew it was, like, that hit home.  When BCN would goof on us about the signal, that was something we couldn't defend.  It was, yeah, you're right.  Damn it.  Hey, uh...  We would have to say, more importantly, we're putting on a quality show.  So don't be hypocritical.  Don't be hypocritical.  During this catastrophe.  Right.  All right.  We're going to get it.  Hey, uh... 
[01:16:30]  Uh, John from Dallas.  It's Mantown, where no one sleeps on their backs.  Uh...  And then Steve from Bayshore, just on fire.  Where is his?  This thing's updating so fast, I've got to find it now.  Ah, Steve from Bayshore.  Mantown, where the local football team has no tight end.  Oh, the whole country realizes what a dumb, dumb bit this is. 
[01:17:00]  The Mantown, they want their sports team to be called the Rams.  From Dead Bent.  Thank you.  I don't like how the listeners are coming up with better slogans than we have.  Of course they are.  They always do.  Eric in New York, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  Hey.  Mantown, where men are better, sheep are nervous.  That old gag.  Let's say hi to Tim in New York.  Tim, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Mantown, where the words no homo get you smacked right in the mouth. 
[01:17:30]  No homo.  All right, here's the second promo they're running on WBCN up there in Boston.  Opie, Anthony, is there something you'd like to say to Hillman?  Hillman, we're coming to get you.  They turn the stools upside down when you sit down at Mantown.  Hillman, is there something you'd like to say to Opie and Anthony?  I'm sure that was profound.  Hitting them with that signal prowl.  In Worcester. 
[01:18:00]  In the words of Jimmy.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, that's great.  That's great.  Weekday mornings at 6 in crystal clear HD stereo on the Rock of Boston, 104.1 WBCN.  See, making fun of the signal again.  It's like, yeah, always.  See, the Mantown or the signal or vault.  How embarrassing.  All right, and finally.  Now I have to pursue the Mantown thing.  Really, oh, that would bug me.  If someone got one of our bits so bad that we either couldn't do it or had to change it  or were just embarrassed to do it every time we had to, like, bring it up. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, you know they're sticking with it.  Just looking down at the console.  You can see a meeting.  Oh, Hillman, what are we going to do?  What are we going to do about Mantown?  It seems kind of silly now.  No, we are sticking with Mantown.  We will do.  Mantown is a place where men hang out.  It is not gay as they have suggested.  How did they come up with that?  That's like Detroit was all of a sudden Hockey Town.  That was bad enough.  Hockey Town.  Mantown. 
[01:19:00]  All right, we got one more promo to play here, and then we'll move on.  Wow.  I think he's up to 17 years of rotting in Worcester.  He's very, very nervous that we're back in Boston.  Anthony.  Oh, but, Dad, I don't like Mantown.  It hurts.  Jim Norton.  Put on your roll, grab your poodle, and head to Med.  Aopian Anthony Virus, weekday mornings at 6 on the Rock of Boston, 104.1 WBCN.  We're on a BCN, and I love him. 
[01:19:30]  See, they're just motivated up there.  Mantown, the only town in the U.S. that has an unzip code.  Uh, let's go to Mr. Hughes.  Mr. Hughes, what's up?  Good morning, bo-bo-boys.  Didn't, uh, didn't Dr. Smith from Lost in Space come from, uh, Mantown?  Oh, dear, smuggled away on the Jupiter 2.  I want to go home.  Sweet, sweet home.  Mantown. 
[01:20:00]  Whoa!  Oh, dear.  Boy, yeah.  Boy, yeah.  Me, young William, sitting in a chair in Mantown, yes.  Watching old episodes of Lost in Space.  Whoa!  Mantown.  That is horrific.  How do they do that?  It is the worst.  It is horrific.  Who came up with it and had everyone agree?  Yeah, that, do you think it was a Hillman idea?  Like, uh, uh, guys, uh, what do you think of, uh, Mantown?  The guy never had an idea.  And everyone just going like, yeah, okay. 
[01:20:30]  They kind of don't want to say no.  The guy never had an idea.  No?  No.  Think it was someone else?  He was too busy trying to get laid and, uh.  Yeah?  Out in Mantown?  He was just, he was just trying to, he was, he was always hunting for poo.  Really?  Oh, yeah, he was.  Ooh.  He's a man.  And mingling with all the, uh, celebrities of Boston.  He never came up with an idea for that radio show.  Not one.  Not one! 
[01:21:00]  We couldn't find it, huh?  No.  These people thought they were coming to a place called Mantown, but our Dateline cameras found them walking in.  Excuse me, what are you doing here, sir?  I just, uh, thought I'd sit and watch the game with a few friends here in Mantown.  You're here for sex, aren't you?  Uh, yes.  Could I have a cookie?  Chris in Houston, Chris.  You're free to leave. 
[01:21:30]  Right, Chris?  Hey, morning, guys.  Hey.  Hey, I, uh, I heard, uh, Andrew Dice Gay is going to be in, uh, Mantown.  Uh, not for Andrew Dice Gay.  Really started to scrape the bottom of the barrel.  Yeah, I know.  No, they haven't, though.  They love the Mantown.  It's Anthony's greatest bit.  Andrew Dice Gay.  There's nothing wrong with two men wanting to share with each other.  I learned over the years that man-on-man love can be a beautiful thing in Mantown. 
[01:22:00]  You sit on a chair, a man sits on your lap, two men being men with each other.  You hear me?  I hear you.  i got a new bedazzled jacket yeah says come to man town  how do you spell that more importantly 
[01:22:30]  all right well there you have it there's the jack and jill went up the hill  bolt with a buck and a quarter jack came down with teddy  they went to man town they're faggotitos  steven from bayshore man town where the official bird is  the swallow don't men can enjoy each other then roll over and watch some sports

[01:24:00]  we'll segue into maybe uh maybe uh scary news teases it's the one virus spreading across america  hi i just got wowed it was great i'm not supposed to talk about it though i gotta go now  welcome back to the opian anthony show uh this is good somebody somebody has the uh unzip code  for man town it's oh oh oh oh oh we got the funniest listeners out there i'm telling you right 
[01:24:30]  now they love to contribute and we love competing in radio we love it yeah and precedent steve down  there in philly they think they're getting a free pass no we're keeping close tabs on those guys  and we'll be attacking soon philly and on uh you know they they don't just uh willy-nilly throw us 
[01:25:00]  on the air without doing a little of what they call um you know a little research they they test the  waters before official numbers come in and apparently philly uh taken very kindly to our return philly's  turning around fast and then we'd love to goof on a show here in new york but uh they're all lazy  they really are that's what's so weird about uh radio you get to new york and then you get to 
[01:25:30]  become lazy radio guy yeah because this is pretty much the pinnacle of radio if you're a radio guy  new york is the number one market in the country so once you get here you figure you're done and you  really don't have to work that hard anymore to get anywhere so uh yeah no one's really doing much  i wish we uh had someone to attack but we don't at this time they're all just lazy going through  the motions when does whoopee start oh yeah whoopee in the morning that'll be fun wake up with whoopee  in the morning oh whoopee goldberg i can't wait to play some of those clips until the cnd comes in 
[01:26:00]  we can't wait because uh wow that's gonna be just an abomination who doesn't want to wake up with  whoopee in the morning uh everybody everyone everybody all right with whoopee let me let me tell you  what that sounds like waking up with whoopee how much did i drink last night my god  i'm in man town you run out of her apartment with only you run out of her apartment with only one 
[01:26:30]  arm that old gag exactly mouthful of blood right oh looking like a wolf as you're running down the  the street after waking up with whoopee everyone understands why you did it when you explain  right oh that would just be horrific all right we got a ground zero explosion update of course  gonna just show you how silly the news really is because i think a lot of people out there forgot 
[01:27:00]  we we brought this story to everyone's attention uh last weekend we made fun of the news for even  going uh with this angle and now we got an update in the paper so uh just in case you weren't  listening last week or whatever you were checking out something else here's the story the rebuilding  at ground zero getting off to an explosive start this week workers will set off several explosions  today as work begins on the new freedom tower fox 5's katherine craig at ground zero right now so  katherine what can we expect lucy the test explosion will last about 15 seconds each and they're expected 
[01:27:30]  to start right around 10 o'clock this morning but some people who work down here are telling us they  really don't know what to expect my co-worker will be working tomorrow so i'm gonna i'm gonna give her  heads up in the morning so she's not too shocked mike walsh manages a currency exchange near the world  trade center site he says the series of construction explosions could rattle some people's nerves  if you hear loud glass that it would bring some kind of effect to them especially being right next  to it they know it's coming from the site i'm serving back some kind of memories this is such a 
[01:28:00]  non-story first of all let me get see we don't know what's going to happen we're just going to go down  there and light off explosions yeah right a building could fall down right in front of you no engineers  down there so much nah throw sticks of dynamite into a hole see what happens that didn't work out too  good huh phil throw it over there next time right you see the windows break in that building yeah  all right throw it throw it a little further dude that wasn't me that one that's on you 
[01:28:30]  we don't know what's going to happen yes you do and then we got more audio but the building  contractor says the planned explosions are very different from what happened on 9-11 the blast  footings for the new freedom tower contractor tishman construction says the alternative to the  occasional 15 second blast is this jack hammers and backhoes would use 50 000 gallons of diesel to  do the job the contractor also says the blast would add up to 10 minutes over two months doing the job 
[01:29:00]  with construction equipment would take 2500 hours of drilling the drawbacks include crews stopping the  path train they'll shut down parts of vc street so it goes on and on yeah the most important part of  that clip that clip should have ended right after she says is going to be different than what happened  on 9-11 that's where that clip should have ended because that's what you want to comment on the fact  that she had to say that these controlled construction explosions are going to be different than two 
[01:29:30]  jet aircraft full of fuel hitting buildings innocent people yeah yeah full of it it's gonna be a little  different a little bit different than but before that they had to find the people dying unbelievable  yeah but before that they had to find the dopes on the street that uh are a little scared because  like oh well what is that i didn't think they're worse it was the way they edit it the way they ask  questions like yeah yeah so we have i guess it you know somebody could be a little rattled edit  people are rattled down so this was a huge story last week and uh all the news was covering it we have the 
[01:30:00]  update in the paper today what is it anthony uh the update was that there's so much noise going on  down there in that whole area with the cars on west side highway uh business other construction going  on that no one even noticed or heard these explosive explosions going on what they do is they drill hole  in the rock they put the explosives down in it and then they put these huge heavy uh mats that are weighed 
[01:30:30]  down with chains over the top of it and you get this explosion and it breaks the rock apart because  all the energy it's not just like they're throwing bombs down there they want the energy to go down  into the rock not up where you would then hear the explosion and see anything they don't know what's  gonna happen i heard i heard they don't know what's gonna happen so apparently nothing people heard  nothing really saw nothing it was a non-event but the big graphic behind the uh anchor the night i 
[01:31:00]  watched it was explosions at ground zero that that was just the graphic so it visually caught you to rope  you in like what what happened what explosions nothing no one heard it they went about their business  just like they do every day there are explosions on job sites all over manhattan  with this whole island is a rock so when you build a building every new building you see 
[01:31:30]  has used explosives it's no different down there but they want to just you know make a tie-in and  more importantly they don't know more importantly they don't know what's going to go on down there  bunch of hypocrites man oh yeah so you can compare what they're doing down there to that  catastrophe all right i know uh what is it gonna end never it's because you struggled with it was 
[01:32:00]  that catastrophic oh i was just all over the whole pronunciation was a catastrophic  more and then he makes fun of people which is hypocritical you guys might want to rent a band of  brothers you might want to go out and rent band of brothers i own it well why don't you watch it a little  closer more importantly a little closer well they stick together i get it we should stick together  sometimes all right this hurts my feelings let's make this into man town we all just stick together 
[01:32:30]  as men here we go news news teases and take each other scary news teases yeah look at how we uh  sing into things here on the opian anthony show uh the scary news tease is just like what we uh just  played for you they're all over the news they're there just to make you watch longer they happen  all over the country it doesn't matter where i've been i've turned on the news and seen it  they try to either tie in the one thing i hate is the tie-in of a movie big movie that's come out 
[01:33:00]  they try to tie it in or make a local angle uh they try to scare you uh they don't give you  enough information during the teaser that you have to watch the news because your children are in  some kind of danger but they won't tell you what it is until the news comes on king kong's coming  out and they got jack black at the zoo yeah in front of apes so jack black you know they're normally  docile creatures more importantly jack black is here so we're working on the news tease uh hall of fame 
[01:33:30]  yep that's uh where this bit's gonna end eventually we got two in the hall of fame right now okay it's  this one the famous one one city wants to pack all their sex offenders into a three-block area  problem is it could be right next to your house oh boy oh boy one of the greatest i don't think we  ever beat that one that is not happening anywhere by the way right of course not stop it of course not  and then this one how a twist on the predator law could shut down religion 
[01:34:00]  can shut down religion that doesn't even make sense at all well they they that was a news tease  that was a news tease that is so we got the latest batch of news teases meant to scare the bejesus  uh yeah oh uh uh six six six we passed six six six what a little over a week ago at this point  whatever so uh and why weren't they calling it six six zero six because of what it was 
[01:34:30]  because only in the year six was it actually six six six yeah after that sorry there's another number  in there you're just leaving it out i don't think the mark of the beast was six six oh six or six six  two thousand that's the mark of like someone kind of bad maybe a bad attitude  not really just june six two thousand six that's all it is oh six six six oh six he was supposed  to be really bad but he's got a bad chromosome yeah he just has it just missed uh well here we go so

[02:22:30]  can i say for the record that this program sucks a fat dick i got a few ideas they could get it fired  please use them please use them but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road  so  so 
[02:23:00]  so  so  How the hell did Tippi Tom get in here? 
[02:23:30]  We shut off the mics, come in,  and I thought they were out on the street.  And I walk up to the elevators,  and I see Tippi Tom standing by the elevator.  And the smell was just horrifying everybody.  He gets in an elevator, and then I had to wait.  I'm not going to get on the same elevator he's on.  Wait for another elevator.  And now he's out there stinking up this whole joint. 
[02:24:00]  Oh, you know, I understand that homeless people  don't have the, you know, ability to shower  and keep clean, brush their teeth,  do things that normal people do on a daily basis.  But is there something you can do?  It's been raining for two fucking weeks here.  There's no reason to smell like that.  You're right.  You get out in the rain.  Put your armpit up to the sky.  And just let it rinse. 
[02:24:30]  That's right.  Something.  The guy stinks worse than it.  It's different.  It's a little different than it was last time.  But it's worse.  It's a urine.  It's not so much armpit this time.  Which is why you need acid rain to clear that off.  That's the only way to clean a homeless guy  is a nice downpour of acid rain.  Buckets of acid rain over his head.  And then there's like, I'm afraid of lice and stuff.  The guy's hair is a petri dish. 
[02:25:00]  There is, it's like an ant farm.  No, I'm itchy.  My eyebrows itching.  For lice.  And he's got something like tar or gum or something  stuck in, or blood stuck in his head.  It's like a whole compound.  It's like a Beverly Hills for germs.  Yeah.  Just sitting there.  You've made it if you get in.  It's germ town is what it is.  It's his head.  Right.  That's what was right behind his ear.  It was like the Bill Gates germ mansion.  Right. 
[02:25:30]  The mansion.  And then all the rest of the subjects live all over  the rest of his, the parts of his head and beard.  And just a big hair.  He's got a big Yosemite Sam fucking mustache beard thing going on.  Sounds like the Tasmanian devil.  He's a mess.  You can't understand.  He just stinks.  Enough.  That was a lot of fun.  Hey, somebody scored a goal.  Holy shit.  In World Cup?  Yeah.  Who do you want to win?  I hear the U.S. is doing pretty good. 
[02:26:00]  I want the U.S. to win.  Just because no one here would even know.  Nah.  Or care.  Just so you could go over there in Europe and just,  did we win that thing?  The world would be angry, but no one here would care.  I need a password for my other thing.  That's right.  We got to win that thing because we're not going to win the Tour de France this year.  And you know, it's been pissing off the French, so.  Of course.  We already lost in World Cup, right?  We lost three to nothing to.  To what?  To these other guys who I guess were really good.  Like the Republic of Croatia, Ghana. 
[02:26:30]  Some kind of Brazilian type team.  Yeah.  What?  I think we lost.  First game?  Yeah, we lost three to nothing.  I think we lost to the Czech Republic.  That's right.  I thought it was.  We're playing Ghana.  I thought it was Rhode Island.  Yeah, Rhode Island.  We lost to Rhode Island.  It was that country we lost to.  They got a hell of a team.  They scored like right away.  The Woonsocket Rebels.  Woonsocket.  The Pawtucket Socks.  Oh yeah, that's so hilarious up there.  It's like you murder all the Indians and then you name all the towns after them.  Just out of respect.  Out of respect.  I live in Pawtucket. 
[02:27:00]  God bless.  God bless.  All right, what do you want to get into here?  I live near Ponka Pog Golf Course.  Well, I guess right away we should do the dump sheet.  Why not?  What guy in the elevator was teasing me?  He wasn't teasing.  He was trashing the guys.  What was I saying?  Oh.  And why wasn't he pointed out at that moment?  Wait, which guy?  He was wearing a blue shirt, balding head.  Just now?  On my way up in the elevator before you guys came up.  What did he say?  He has a heavy lisp and he was saying, he's like, oh my God, at least Howard Stern was funny 
[02:27:30]  to be 35 years old and hanging out with homeless people in a marching band and just going off  the whole ride up just ranting about how awful this show was.  Where?  Which floor was he going to?  Eighth floor.  Eighth floor.  Why didn't you drag him in here?  I talked to him and he's just like, get away from me and he walked off on the elevator.  Yeah, get away from me.  You pussy faggot.  Why don't you come down here?  And the homeless and marching band was for the walk.  Believe me, I wouldn't want to hang out with him either.  I thought that was right.  Maybe he's right. 
[02:28:00]  And we got some funny out of it.  We got a lot of funny out of it.  What a baby.  Nah.  Did Bill Burr say that?  We got the first dump of the day.  Let's go to the dump sheet.  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, the Daily Dump Report.  Here's what it's all about, people.  Here's what was dumped out of on our FM show today.  Okay, we've made it all the way up to 8.18 a.m. before the first dump. 
[02:28:30]  I think that's a record.  Radioactive leaves up against your anus.  I don't understand why.  Bill Burr during a discussion of the end of the world.  How the hell did you end up with that?  Why would that be dumped?  Radioactive leaves up against your anus.  I guess because there's some kind of contact.  I don't know.  Yeah, but it's up against.  You can't say in.  It's not in or penetrating or something.  It's just up against.  You're wiping with radioactive leaves.  I told you that story when I did Conan. 
[02:29:00]  I had that line.  We're going to take this pan and shove it up your ass.  Yeah.  You can't shove anything up an ass.  You can shove it up a butt.  And I was like, butt isn't funny.  I have to say ass.  Ass.  And it was like a three-way call.  And I go, wait, can I put it?  I'm like, put it up your ass?  And there was like literally a three-second pause.  And the guy was just like, yeah.  Yeah, I think that's all right.  You can't shove.  You can't shove it.  Shove is too much.  Putting it.  How stupid is that whole setup?  All right.  It doesn't make sense.  That was 818.  I don't really agree with that one, by the way. 
[02:29:30]  820 AM.  Get aroused enough to tackle him on his bike.  Bill Burr during a discussion of him as a young paper boy and how nothing ever happened to him.  Get aroused enough to tackle him on his bike.  See, that I don't agree with either.  Aroused.  I'm a rebel.  That doesn't...  Bill, you're on fire today.  826, a mere six minutes later.  Bill Burr again.  What is this shit?  And I remember... 
[02:30:00]  That was the good slip.  I remember looking at Bill and he was thinking that was the first dump of the day.  Yeah, but apparently...  As we just saw, we have two other dumps before this.  I don't really like those two before, but 847 AM, Tippy Tom, bullshit.  Tippy Tom in the background saying bullshit.  848 AM, Tippy Tom.  849, Tippy Tom.  Yeah, 849 AM, we have Tippy Tom in the background again saying fuck.  And then we finish off the show with Tippy Tom, 854.  Right at the end, yeah.  No, he tied it up in the fourth quarter. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, he did.  I was killing him.  Yeah, he brought it all.  I was on three nothing.  He brought the heat with, my balls smell good.  Tippy Tom dumped because Anthony referenced that it was a body part.  He hit a three-pointer with no time left.  That was it.  Six dumps today.  Three for Bill Burr, three for Tippy Tom.  Oh!  Denied.  You did not.  Swatted.  I hope he crumbles the paper every day and tries to shoot for the garbage pail, but he was denied. 
[02:31:00]  I'm going to go over the top.  Denied again.  Jim never denies us.  Of anything.  Jim Norton lets us score every time.  Yeah, we shove it up his ass.  That's the old North basketball player in me.  All right.  Hey, let's say hi to Turkish Taffy.  Turkish Taffy, what's up?  Hey, we're going to do any Tippy Tom radio at the end of the show?  Yeah.  Tippy Tom radio.  Hey, that's good.  I'll be gone.  I'm not going to listen. 
[02:31:30]  Tippy Tom and Blue doing some radio?  I'd say we do it now.  No.  No, because it's going to smell the whole...  Actually, you know what would be great?  I think acoustically, if they're going to sing songs, if they sang right over there in the corner, right next to Anthony.  If you're, you know something, you don't understand...  You're hot.  You're so hot, it's not even funny.  It's so funny how naive you are that you don't understand this show.  I believe you're speaking down to me at this point.  I am.  You don't understand me.  You don't understand the history of me with people like this on this show.  I will leave. 
[02:32:00]  I will just leave the show.  If that got to the point where he came near me...  If you go to leave, I'm going to do to you what I just did to that piece of paper, son.  I'm going to fucking smack you.  You're going to smack me down?  Smack me down?  Come on.  I want to see Anthony be uncomfortable.  Look at me right now.  I'm uncomfortable that I'm looking at him through the...  Why is the window fogging up behind him?  You didn't see him uncomfortable in the other studio?  Why is the window fogging up behind his head?  Oh, my God.  We've never seen that before. 
[02:32:30]  I've never seen...  Explain this.  He is sitting behind the glass that separates our studio from the office.  We have like a 4x8 piece of glass.  You know what I feel like right now?  I feel like I'm in that movie Outbreak.  We're like the scientists looking in on the subject.  Yeah, I want those big gloves that you stick your arms through,  and I want to smack them in the head with them.  That's really funny.  And the glass is turning this weird white color.  Oh, my God.  Why is that happening?  Why does Blue keep just pointing at me and like laughing?  Yeah, get a wireless mic on Blue. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, wireless.  You know, the ones that work from out there.  He just came back from Venom.  I think a six-month stint upstate.  Upstate?  For what?  Rape?  I think he'll have to tell you himself.  Oh, cool.  Let's find out.  Usually these guys don't want to fess up to why they were in the jernt.  Yeah, Keith, go out there,  because they listen to you when you start nodding and going,  it's okay, you can tell them.  Yeah, tell why he's in the jernt.  Keith, the cop outside the studio with Blue.  Are you on the air?  I didn't know that.  Didn't know that. 
[02:33:30]  Like, it matters.  Like, he changes anything he does by being on the air.  I like how Keith's been a cop so long that no smell bugs him anymore.  No, no, he sits with a nuzzle up right next to him.  Keep the door open.  Dressed like he's at a backyard barbecue.  He doesn't care.  So Keith can hear us.  Go ahead, Keith.  All right, Big Blue was just talking to the boys inside.  They were curious, uh, what, uh...  I'm hanging.  I'm hanging.  They want to know, uh, what were you just up in the joint for?  It's all right, you can tell them.  It's just us. 
[02:34:00]  I got trouble with the law.  Well, we know that.  What happened?  And the sky is blowing.  Yeah, what did you do or not do?  I broke a police officer's hand.  You broke a cop's hand?  How'd that happen?  Did what you do rhyme with grape?  No, but actually, I mean...  How'd that happen?  How'd that happen?  Yeah.  I was drinking some brown beer.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  And...  You're drinking beer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom's got to chime in.  In man town.  I got kicked out my house.  Yeah.  And I just was drinking some beer.  But what happened with the cop and his hand?  Hand got broke.  I got locked up.  But how did...  Lumps on my face.  How did the cop's hand break?  What did you do?  Did you get in a fight?  You got in a fight with the cop?  Yeah.  And broke his hand?  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  And then they proceeded to break your face with their, uh, nightsticks.  Six months later, the lumps haven't healed, by the way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyone else notice that?  But actually...  Yeah, you can talk.  It's all right, go ahead.  A little good friend of mine.  Actually, I want that behind me, okay?  What?  The microphone?  That's serious.  Oh, oh.  That's at you, boy.  Yeah.  How...  Wait, what upset him?  How is the joint? 
[02:35:30]  How's the joint?  Want to go?  No.  Why?  Because I'm drinking a smoothie now, and I have a feeling it would be a lot similar  to the sensation of having this in my mouth.  I'm drinking a beer.  This is great.  Blue's drinking a beer at 9.30 in the morning.  Anthony has a smoothie.  That's right.  Boy, times have changed.  Times have changed.  Now he's talking now.  But listen.  All right.  But listen.  Okay.  I'm a good guy.  Yeah.  I know that.  Yeah, I know. 
[02:36:00]  You're a good guy.  Yeah.  You just broke a cop's hand.  That's all.  I guess I can talk, man.  There you go.  Who's cell phone's hand?  What's your name again?  Tippi Tom's or Blue's?  I see you right there.  Right there.  You see what?  That one.  Yeah, he sees you two on the sign.  All right.  He sees our pictures on a sign.  Oh, he's looking.  He can't figure out how we can be out there on a sign and be in here doing radio at the  same time.  Tippi Tom's a ham.  What the fuck are you fucking hogging up the phone? 
[02:36:30]  The phone.  Tippi Tom is a ham.  He wants to be on the air.  The microphone.  He smells like a rotting ham.  Let's listen in.  The microphone.  Let's listen in to these guys.  Sucking all the juice.  Now, what I'm saying is this.  Come on.  I can't get a word in.  Go ahead, Tom.  I'm saying this.  It would be nice if you shut your mouth.  What's his name?  He's getting all belittled.  Oh, my God.  I get it on his ass.  You got the same name as I do?  How the hell I can't get a word in? 
[02:37:00]  What?  With his big mouth.  Oh.  He's a good friend.  I love him dearly.  My real name is Odell.  Odell?  I know his sister, too.  Oh, he says he knows your sister.  I damn right I do.  Hey, black dude.  What's your name?  She doesn't take no shit from him at all.  What do you say?  Black dude, what's your name?  Odell.  Odell.  Odell.  This is fascinating.  His sister.  So how was the joint? 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, how long were you in the joint?  Aw.  How was the joint?  Come on, it's part of your life, dude.  Embrace it.  How was the joint?  Embrace it.  I know his sister.  I was up in North.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And how hard was that?  Was it hard time?  Hard time?  How was that him, Tom?  It was a little slackly.  Slackly?  Yeah.  How many riots were you in?  How'd you get your booze in the joint?  I get what?  Food? 
[02:38:00]  Booze.  How'd you get liquor in the joint?  Okay, give me some fruit.  Yeah.  And a lot of bread.  And water.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, these motherfuckers turn into chemists when they have to get in the joint.  That's what you call hoots.  Hoots.  So you make some hoots in the joint, and it's good stuff?  It'll get you drunk?  When you make it, your ass go to the box.  You what? 
[02:38:30]  The box.  Solitaire.  Solitaire, if you get caught making the booze.  You're out of population.  This is population.  You ever get caught making a hoots and sent to the box?  We're lucky.  No?  Nope.  You're good at it.  But my boys, I had it set up.  Because I was in a mess hall.  Right.  So you were able to get the fruit and the bread.  I was working in a mess hall.  Did you ever make a shank?  Huh?  You ever make a shank or shiv?  I don't like weapons, okay? 
[02:39:00]  Oh, you don't like white boys?  No, weapons.  Oh.  I just figured.  He's black.  In prison.  Why?  I don't like white boys.  You don't like weapons?  I don't like white people.  My friend.  You don't like weapons?  I thought for protection, you'd need, like, a knife.  Protection?  Yeah, you're working a mess hall.  You couldn't get a knife?  How much are you going to pay for protection?  Why?  You'd have to pay for protection?  He's a good man.  What are you buying?  With cigarettes? 
[02:39:30]  Blue's laughing at you.  Stupid white boy don't know what goes on in jail.  Thank God.  All right, listen.  We got to go to the phone real fast.  Tony in Jersey.  What's up?  All right, what's up, boys?  Listen, I'm listening to JV and Elvis just because I have no XM in my truck, I know.  But they're in there talking all kinds of shit about how they wanted to have some big, you know, comedy tour  and some other show just stepped in and stole it from.  And since you guys were looking for, sorry, everybody's being lazy, nobody to start shit with. 
[02:40:00]  There you go.  Wait, I'm hearing rumors about this.  JV and Elvis follow us on Free FM here in New York City.  And a few instant feedbacks came in and such, and now we're getting a couple phone calls here.  We've got to get to the bottom of this.  They're saying we stole the idea for a comedy tour?  We've been doing this for a while.  What are they saying?  I don't know.  They're saying that it had to do with the management.  The management was, they've been talking to them a while about doing some comedy tour,  and then they just hand it off to another show. 
[02:40:30]  Imagine, but we've been planning this before we got to CBS.  We've been planning this with Pete Popolardo for about, how long?  About a year.  Get JV and Elvis on the phone.  We didn't steal no comedy tour from anybody.  We've been trying to work on getting something together for our comedian friends for years.  Plus it's not a bit.  Years and years.  A comedy tour is something that exists.  A lot of people do it.  That's like a musical tour.  You stole that from me. 
[02:41:00]  Right.  And obviously, if you look at the lineup of our comedy tour, the Opie and Anthony traveling  virus, it's all the guys you know and love from the show.  It's our pal.  That's the key to the whole event.  Guys, we have on the show all the time.  Yeah, that's the key.  We're not just throwing our names on some generic comedy event.  And we did something very similar about a year and a half ago called The Passion of O&A.  Yeah.  It was a smaller version of this.  That's where this started, actually.  We tried it out.  It worked nice. 
[02:41:30]  And then we were waiting for the opportunity to expand.  And we figured now that we're syndicated back to commercial radio, the time is now.  What are they saying now?  That management just handed it to us?  Yeah, they're just saying that they had this idea for a long time and that, like, you guys  just waltzed in and, like, they didn't say that, but that's what, they didn't say like  you waltzed in and took it, but that's the way it came off when they said that.  No, see, now you can't say things like that.  We need exactly how it was presented. 
[02:42:00]  All right, this is exactly how it was presented.  Because this is how shit gets started.  All right, this is exactly how they said it.  We've been talking about getting a comedy show together for a long time, and they just  handed it off to another show.  It had nothing to do with this.  We came to them with this idea.  Yeah, we came to them after it was all pretty much set in stone.  We'd been working on it with Pete for a long time.  Actually, we were working on it for over a year.  Yeah, we kind of put it on hold for a little while. 
[02:42:30]  They wanted to do this last summer, but we were just on XM, and we were still building  an audience, so we didn't think the time was right.  Yeah.  They have no comedians on that show anywhere.  I don't know who they're going to put on.  They have, you know, I only have to listen because I'm in this dumb security truck.  I feel awful for not fucking having XM.  If you look at the lineup, these are our guys.  No one else in New York radio can claim that these are their guys.  I mean, sure, some of the guys on our list here do all the shows from time to time, 
[02:43:00]  but the number one show they like to do is obviously the Opie and Anthony show.  It wasn't like this was set for J.B. and Elvis, and then they just handed it over to us.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, it wasn't like that was there.  These are our friends.  This is something we've been working on for a long time to take care of these guys because  they work for free.  They come in here and bust their balls to make this show better, and this is our way of thanking  them.  This is something that's going to get a lot bigger, by the way.  You guys should have left both those homeless bastards in there for them the whole time.  All right.  Well, thank you, Tony. 
[02:43:30]  We're trying to get them on the phone.  That seems a little sketchy.  Yeah, a little sketchy.  Yeah, but there's info coming in on the instant feedback, some phone calls.  Yeah, but I need to know exactly what it is.  I want to get to the bottom of this.  If it's like we did something or they are under the impression that management did something.  But the truth of the matter is, yeah, this is something we've been planning with Pete  for over a year.  We've been knocking this around.  I remember going to meetings about this forever. 
[02:44:00]  Getting the right people together, the venues, how we're going to do it.  And the reason that we are doing it now is because we have a bigger audience.  We're reaching more people.  Time to do it.  One big positive that came from going back to commercial radio.  Now we're able to do these bigger events.  Look at us now.  Screener said he'd pass it on.  Not sure if they'll talk on air.  The beef is with management, apparently.  Yeah.  Management didn't hand us this. 
[02:44:30]  It was our deal.  We went to them.  It's my deal, Wade.  Boy, these are some sweet numbers.  We went to them.  And no offense to JV and Elvis or anyone else that works at Free FM in New York.  I don't even know the lineup, and that's the God's honest truth.  I know the radio chick is in there somewhere, probably afternoons, late afternoons, somewhere like that.  I don't know.  So we're not paying attention to what other shows are doing on that station and then stealing their ideas.  That's ridiculous.  We're just busy. 
[02:45:00]  We personally don't have time to listen to any other radio show.  We're too busy doing about six hours of radio a day.  And then taking umpteen meetings and yelling at people that aren't syndicating us quickly enough.  So as far as stealing something from somebody, that's just flat-out ridiculous.  If they were planning something with management, well, we never heard of that.  Then go ahead and do it, too.  It's not...  Yeah, go ahead.  It's not an exclusive thing, a comedy show.  People do them all the time.  I'm sure you could get a few people in some...  Got different comics, different places, whatever. 
[02:45:30]  I'm sure you could get a few people in some comedy clubs around the area.  Do it up.  That's just like doing centers, I'm sure.  You know, you always got to go.  You always got to take it a step before all the info is out.  I know.  Nothing confirmed.  Nothing confirmed.  Nothing.  It's just...  This is how wars get started all the time.  I shoot first, then ask questions.  That's been my motto my entire life, and it's really ruined me. 
[02:46:00]  It certainly has.  And unfortunately, I have to tag along and be ruined with you.  When I ruin, we ruin up, though.  It's a fact.  I don't know how many times I could do that.  No, I understand that.  I don't want to ruin...  I understand that part of it.  I don't want to ruin right now.  You know, you guys, I almost called in sick today.  Why?  Why?  Because I was actually going to fake sick because I wanted to watch Spain play the Ukraine. 
[02:46:30]  In the World Cup.  Well, we'll turn it on for you.  Yeah.  And feel free to just glance over every hour to see if the score has changed.  I'm sure after three hours, you might see two seconds of action.  What is it?  Two zip?  It's too same.  I actually don't mind the sport.  The only thing I don't like is any time you barely get tripped in soccer, the guy acts  like he got hit by a car.  You notice that?  They fucking roll all around.  That happens in basketball, too, with the foul.  The guy flings himself onto the floor.  All you see are, like, baby fawn legs flying up in the air in the arm. 
[02:47:00]  They're sliding on his back.  I don't like this shit.  It's like they have on shin guards.  I mean, I don't know what the fuck the problem is.  All right.  That feels so big.  There's going to be somebody calling, you ever play soccer?  Yeah.  You don't know what it's like.  Shut up.  We got to call into their show.  So, you know, instead of talking about it, let's hash it out.  All right.  Let's hash it out.  What happened?  I want to talk to... 
[02:47:30]  What's up, Travis?  They're not going to be able to get to us today.  Why?  That's what the phone screener said.  He said that...  But they're talking like it was handed...  Yeah, it's going to be amazing.  This comedy show was handed over to us.  No, I know.  Once again, nothing confirmed.  So let's get to the bottom of it.  They can tell us their side of the story, we'll tell our side, and then that's it.  See, now I'm getting a little pissed.  Because if there was enough time to bring it up, there's enough time to settle it and  discuss it like grown men.  He said they have a lot of stuff to get to today. 
[02:48:00]  Well, apparently, a lot of stuff was talking about that.  See what they're saying.  They don't have time to get to you guys.  Exactly.  How does that make you feel?  This was on a list of things they want to talk about today.  So they brought it up.  Now there's people out there thinking that something was handed over to us, and that's ridiculous.  So let's talk it out.  I mean, I wouldn't take that shit.  I mean, personally, it's not how I do things.  All right, Phil, don't stir it up.  It's not how I do things.  You know, somebody says something, you ask them what they say, you should have a common  decency.  I mean, just personally, what I'm saying is... 
[02:48:30]  You're just a troublemaker.  I just walk over there with my bullhorn and start hitting people.  And Opie's a psychopath.  I'm not a psychopath.  I'm trying to be the voice of reason here.  I wanted some confirmation.  But now I'm getting a little, like, a little miffed.  Opie's a very level-headed guy who does not jump to conclusions.  Someday...  And I feel if he's upset...  Someday people...  On bizarro world.  Someday people are going to realize I'm the most normal person in this room.  What are you eating, Opie?  Someday.  What are you eating?  Someday.  It's pineapple day. 
[02:49:00]  He's eating pineapple wedges out of a plastic cup.  Someday people are going to realize I'm one of the most normal people ever.  I'm one of the most normal people.  I've got to take a dump.  I'm trying everything.  You haven't shit in three weeks, Opie.  I don't think your brain is working.  I've had a couple little movements in three days.  And I'm thinking maybe the fruit will help things along.  I'm telling you.  Steam up some broccoli.  You don't.  Shown that down before you go to bed.  You're not going to have any problems.  You don't bring it up if you're not going to discuss it. 
[02:49:30]  Could our listeners at least call the show and say, look...  Not in man town.  Right.  It's not the way it goes down.  You man up in man town, my friend.  Could our listeners call their show and tell them we'll be on for another hour, hour and a half,  and they can call us anytime so we can discuss this, please?  Yeah, we just want to discuss it.  You know, I mean, we're not going to hide.  I mean, we'll discuss it.  We'll discuss it right now.  Nothing was handed to us.  This is a comedy show that we've been working on for years.  We did a smaller version a little over a year ago, The Passion of O&A, a year and a half ago about. 
[02:50:00]  And this is our way to help out our fellow friends that help out our show.  And finally get paydays.  And nice paydays, by the way.  Nice payday.  Let me ask something of you.  They said call back tomorrow.  That's the second time you've been slapped in the face on air.  And I'm just saying, personally, if it was my radio show, I'm just saying that, you know, I'd do something about it.  That's me.  Look, let me tell you something.  That's how I handle things.  Out of sheer respect for Tom Chisano, Mark Chernoff, and CBS Broadcasting, I want this kept as civil as possible up until... 
[02:50:30]  Boring!  Up until a point is reached where civility is no longer viable.  Boy, that's terrific.  I'd rather listen to NPR, personally.  Look, Anthony, I would tell you something.  This was back in the day where this wouldn't even be a discussion. 
[02:51:00]  I understand that.  Back in the day of unemployment.  I know these days.  Look.  Anthony has a fear we're going to get fired again.  I don't have a fear that we're going to get fired.  We're not going to get fired.  I just, I have, I have to, I have to give people like Tom Chisano the benefit of the doubt that he can deal with these situations.  He has been in the trenches for over 20 years and knows how to deal with this.  I am also picturing his panicked face at just the sheer thought of a little tiff going on between any of the shows on his station. 
[02:51:30]  We never start the tiffs.  I know we don't.  That's the weird part about this.  But we get the blame for it and, and that will not happen.  I think a real man does not need a mediator.  That's me.  It is called...  That would be a little face-to-face kind of thing.  It is called diplomacy, Bill Burr.  Diplomacy does not exist in the manhood book.  You start with diplomacy, but then if it doesn't, if it doesn't, no.  That's how they do things.  You start with diplomacy.  Let's sit down and discuss.  If nothing is solved over a cup of tea, then you end it with overwhelming force. 
[02:52:00]  I'm just saying you don't start out with the atomic bomb.  How about we discuss with a biscotti and a cup of tea?  I never brought biscottis into this conversation.  Green tea because it's healthier.  I never said biscotti.  Anthony, how good is your information on this?  It's damn good.  It's damn good.  It's damn good.  Hey, guys, would you like a blueberry scone so we can discuss?  Look, I'm not talking about that. 
[02:52:30]  I'm saying...  Maybe we can have a game of badminton after we're done.  After we're done settling this.  I know.  He's going a little Johnny Cakes on this.  Out of respect for Joel Hollander.  Anthony Johnny Cakes over here.  Talking about diplomacy.  And the management...  What kind of syrup do you like, Anthony?  At CBS, I am going to try to be diplomatic at first.  If that does not work, then, and only then, will we use the overwhelming force that we know 
[02:53:00]  the Opie and Anthony show is capable of in destroying any adversary.  But this is a...  With this power, this overwhelming power of the Opie and Anthony show, comes responsibility.  We do not want to turn away our allies, Tom Chiusano, Mark Chernoff, Joel Hollander.  What firehouse have you been hanging around lately?  What?  Excuse me?  Firehouse you've been hanging around lately?  No, I have not been in a firehouse in New Hampshire. 
[02:53:30]  Can you do the rest of your speech as Hillary Clinton?  And I think the first step is diplomacy, because that is the way we handle it as responsible broadcasters.  Act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act, act.  And then, if things go awry, we will bring out the force that we know this show is capable of. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, God.  Do you think that they want to talk to you, but the hole is sitting there saying, no, no, don't take their hole?  No, they don't have much to go on, so they don't want to talk to us, because I think we would...  Yeah, let's not use the puns as a scapegoat.  Right.  I think we'd win the argument.  They don't want to go down that road.  Do you think that's why we're not getting a phone call right now?  You got it.  Yeah, whatever.  Fine.  The thing that upsets me here, and this will be brought up in a diplomatic way, is the fact 
[02:54:30]  that if it's not going to be enough time, if there's not going to be enough time to talk  to us, don't bring it up on the air.  Don't bring it up on the air.  Thank you.  Because.  Thank you.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  If they brought it up on the air, they should have then taken the call.  I saw the rumblings this morning, and I was...  So did I.  I saw them actually a couple of days ago. 
[02:55:00]  And I was giving them the benefit of the doubt, but then now coming over here, it continues,  so there's something to it.  So now we've got to get to the bottom of it.  You guys do a lot of talking.  All right, here we go.  They're not making my smoothies a bit too soft lately.  You bastards.  All I'm saying is they're right across the street.  You know?  I'm just, you know.  Phil, is that a long walk?  You're an instigator.  You are an instigator.  Why don't we send E-Rock into enemy territory with a cell phone?  Oh, Jesus.  With a cell phone.  See? 
[02:55:30]  Why not?  All right, well, we're talking about the...  All right, I have no problem with that.  We're talking about Opie and Anthony's Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  This is what you need to know.  So this Friday at 9 a.m., tickets go on sale for three shows through Ticketmaster.  The dates, Saturday, August 5th, Worcester at the DCU Center.  The lineup for Worcester, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly,  Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  Jesus Christ.  The only one on that list that hasn't done our show on a regular basis, Bob Saget. 
[02:56:00]  But he's been on this program.  But he's been on the show.  I shared a first class little flight with him too, my friend.  And he's a new friend, and we think...  And he's fucking hilarious.  Down in the baggage carousel, and we got our bags together.  And we think he would fit in great with the guys.  Saturday, August 26th, at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Jersey, the lineup is Rich Voss, Patrice  O'Neill, Bill Burr, Bob Kelly, Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, Carlos Mencia, and Jim Norton.  And then finally, for now, I guess, September 9th, Tweeter Center, Camden, New Jersey, for 
[02:56:30]  all you Philly folk.  We got a huge lineup.  Actually, there's like two or three extra comedians down there.  Jimmy Schubert, Don Marrera, Rich Voss, Patrice O'Neill, Bill Burr, Ralphie May, Bob Kelly,  Tracy Morgan, Bob Saget, and Jim Norton.  Nobody ever spells his name right.  Obviously, these are friends of the show.  Look for us at the Watuka Hut Fairgrounds in Iowa, where we'll be doing our fourth show.  Dates to be announced.  Robbie Knievel will be jumping some dumpsters out there. 
[02:57:00]  All the Carasaurus will be there picking up old cars like a big mechanical dinosaur.  All this info is up on opiananthony.com.  But the key, tickets go on sale Friday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  We'll continue with Bill Burr in just a bit.  Call me the seeker I've been searching low and high  I won't get to get what I'm after Till the day I die 
[02:57:30]  You're checking out the Opian Anthony show, Bill Burr in studio.  He's playing Carolines all this weekend, starting tomorrow night through Sunday.  Bill, you get the Sunday show?  Yes, I am.  All the info is on myspace.com slash Bill Burr.  And yeah, three shows Saturday.  The dreaded three shows Saturday.  Wow.  When I become a fancy man, that's one of the first ones in the rider. 
[02:58:00]  So one show Thursday, two Friday.  Two Friday, three Saturday.  Three Saturday.  And how many Sunday?  Two?  Only one.  One Sunday.  One Sunday.  Because if I go all out after three shows, I'm walking out of there with like a fucking IV.  I can't even talk.  And the thing is, you can't take a show off as a comedian because you're going to bomb.  It's like, and the fear of bombing is like what keeps you going.  It's just fucking.  Yeah.  I don't know.  That's what I wish I was.  I didn't have to like jump around and make faces to make people laugh. 
[02:58:30]  I wish I could actually write a good joke and just stand there.  And I saw this on the paper and just somehow just be killing.  And people are laughing and you're nothing physical going on with you whatsoever.  Oh yeah.  Just fucking robot mode.  I can't.  I don't know.  I lack that ability.  Write something so funny.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  There's comics out there.  Yeah.  They can just stand there.  Now, yeah, they can just fucking stand there and kill.  And I've always, I've always respected that like.  Bastard.  Yeah.  It's like. 
[02:59:00]  But no goofy faces.  I got to make faces.  I got to put voices on.  I got to do all that.  I like Brian Regan.  I got to lace every joke with the F word.  We tried to get Brian Regan for our tour, by the way.  Opie and Anthony's traveling virus.  Now we get to talk about the guys that said no.  I don't think Brian wanted to be party to.  It's probably because he can sell it out on his own six times.  He's got an image of being a clean comic.  And I think that.  It's not an image of a clean comic.  It would have been all right.  I don't think so. 
[02:59:30]  I think people.  We did try.  Believe me.  I think he was thinking of his audience and subjecting them to our audience.  Because people would have bought tickets just because of Regan.  Forget the rest of the ticket.  That's a good point.  Forget that.  So now Regan's audience, old ladies sometimes, they get a lot of young guys and stuff.  But he's a family-oriented comic.  Sitting there in the midst of pandemonium and rapists.  And what is our audience of creeps. 
[03:00:00]  And racists.  And all the bad guys.  And yeah.  Rapists.  Racists.  And, you know, he probably thought about, you know, man, my audience.  You're smart.  I bring them to that thing.  Todd in Atlanta.  Todd.  Hey, I just wanted to ask Ant if yesterday he was using diplomacy with Elo.  No, that was, I had used diplomacy before.  See, you people didn't get to hear the diplomacy that I used over the phone over the past few months. 
[03:00:30]  That was when diplomacy failed.  You heard that yesterday.  That was great.  That was what I do.  And that was only a few howitzers coming out.  That was great, too.  I made sure I listened to the replay yesterday.  It was a very fun half hour to listen back to.  Yeah.  People that are sick of the bitching.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you.  Because that was great.  Especially when Anthony loses his mind.  I lost my mind.  Some people don't think Bob Saget fits in.  They're like, why is Saget?  He doesn't fit in with the bill.  I read a few of those posts. 
[03:01:00]  And it's like, dude, do you know what Bob Saget's all about?  He's filthy.  The guy is one of the most heinous comics.  His material is like pedophile jokes.  I think some of his material rivals Jimmy as far as being a despicable human being.  And he's always been known for that.  Yeah.  Like his friends goofed on him when he was on Full House.  They laughed at him.  You know, of course, he was laughing back, throwing wadded up hundreds at their head.  When he had that thing going and Funniest Home Videos. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, did you just hate him?  His friends hated him.  Because they knew he wasn't like that in real life.  That he was one of the dirtiest comics out there.  We don't have that CD anymore, E-Rock?  What's he supposed to do?  You know what I mean?  Exactly.  He doesn't look like Brad Pitt.  So, I mean, fuck it.  Take the money.  You're schlepping around some clubs.  You're doing all right.  And then you get an offer to do a show on ABC that's just like, that winds up taking off.  A lot of guys, a lot of comics do pilots and stuff that probably, you know, you go, I'll 
[03:02:00]  try it.  You don't think it's the best fit for your image or something.  But then it takes off like that fucking show did.  Of course you're going to, what are you going to, oh, wow, this is good.  I quit.  That's always the fear when you go into your auditioning for something and you actually  do well.  You're like, ah, shit, do I really want to get this?  I hope I don't get this.  I remember one time, you know what I tested for?  I tested for Fame LA.  Oh, wow.  That would be the show Fame based in LA. 
[03:02:30]  This was like, this was years ago.  Wow.  Years ago.  I would hope so.  Not now playing.  Oh, yeah, I know.  HBO special and Fame LA.  That's my big follow up.  No, I ended up testing for that.  They wanted, obviously wanted a comedian as part of the thing.  And I remember you had to go up on stage at the improv and do improv with some people  from the ground links and I ate a big shit sandwich on that one.  Nice, nice big thick one. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, yeah.  Bulky roll.  No chewing.  Just shoved right down my gullet.  Just negated all of auditioning.  Not a hint of goodness in that sandwich.  Oh, there was a giant shit sandwich.  No hot sauce.  Nothing to taper it off.  Nothing.  It was a big six foot shit hero just for you.  Remember those old Carl's Jr.'s commercials with Dennis Rodman?  That's what I had.  Dave in Tennessee, what's up?  I had the number two.  Dave?  Yeah. 
[03:03:30]  Hey, I was wondering why you never played the Bob Saget interview when he was on your show.  Because, honestly, I didn't know that he was that filthy of a comic until he was on there  talking about, what was that movie they did, The Rest of Craft or something like that?  Yep.  Yeah.  I mean, I had no idea until I heard that.  You ought to play that one back.  I haven't heard that.  Yeah, we can replay Bob Saget.  But if you guys take off at 11, throw that on.  All right.  That's not a bad idea.  All right.  We'll try to get the Bob Saget interview on today or tomorrow so you can see how dirty  he really is. 
[03:04:00]  They're running around trying to find the aristocrats.  I love how you have to justify a comedian for this tour.  No, no.  He's just a degenerate.  He's fucking hated.  He's horrible.  I think he's murdered people.  You're going to be pleasantly surprised.  Yes.  All right.  Beach Boys.  We'll get back to Saget in a second.  Beach Boys.  What are they celebrating?  40 years of what?  Horrific harmony.  Bad music.  Bad unchanged in 40 years music.  Who has the high-pitched voice?  Is it all of them?  Those fucking harmonies. 
[03:04:30]  They make you...  Yeah.  I don't even know who does it now.  Because there's other...  There's variations of it.  Like Mike Love.  They never went away.  Mike Love got a band together that he called the Beach Boys.  And then somebody else in the Beach Boys got a band together that he called the Beach Boys.  And then they hate each other.  And then the kids of the Beach Boys somehow were in a band called the Beach Boys.  Yeah.  The Beach Boys.  Recovering drug addicts.  Yeah.  Of rich people.  Yeah.  Fetal alcohol syndrome boys.  You guys have seen that?  John Stamos, I think, was in a version of the Beach Boys.  Of course he was.  Why not? 
[03:05:00]  So...  Wow.  And now they...  Ever you'd want a tour bus to tip over.  Well, now they're talking about getting back together.  Three of the original members.  Yeah.  They met, I guess, Bill Hickok.  Hey, have you guys seen Michael Bolton has a new CD coming out where he sings Frank Sinatra?  Oh, yeah.  I saw that on TV.  The commercial.  What the hell?  He doesn't even look comfortable.  That looks like somebody pitched that idea to him.  Like, Rod Stewart did it with Tony Bennett.  Do you realize there was a point in the early 80s, I think, 
[03:05:30]  where Michael Bolton was a rock guy  and it was actually cool to be a Michael Bolton fan  for five minutes.  Oh, yeah.  He was in a metal band, wasn't he?  For five minutes.  It was like, hey, this is this guy Michael Bolton.  What's he do?  Oh, yeah.  He's a rock guy.  And then something happened.  Didn't he, like, used to be in Whitesnake or something like that?  It was like, yeah, might as well have been.  Something like that.  It was one of those bands, you know.  Just making up shit.  Brother Joe.  Hey, kids.  Hey. 
[03:06:00]  What do you don't?  No, I remember that when we were down in, uh...  Oh, you know what?  You weren't on that.  Of course I wasn't.  I saw the Beach Boys down in, like, Disney or something one year.  Yeah, I saw them in Orlando.  Yeah.  And they were actually really good,  but it was only Mike Love and Al Jardim.  Yeah, because they hate each other.  Who's the other guy, though, that has the other Beach Boys?  Wasn't it one of the Wilson?  Not the dead Wilson, not the crazy Wilson.  The other one.  Not the dead one or the crazy one.  The other one.  The other one. 
[03:06:30]  Not Dennis, not Brian.  It was the other Wilson.  Carl.  Carl Wilson.  Carl Wilson, right?  Carl, uh...  Carl Wilson.  Carl Wilson, sure.  No, yeah.  They were...  It was more like a tribute band, man.  Yeah, I know.  Again, it just turns into bad tribute bands when you only have one guy.  That's why it was so good, because most of them weren't there.  Yeah.  They had a Brian Wilson guy playing bass,  looked just like him and sounded like him,  and a Dennis Wilson guy that was drumming  that got out from behind the drums  and was, like, you know, all over the 80s and stuff, you know. 
[03:07:00]  You ever saw the Beach Boys movie on TV?  It was pretty much the way they were.  Did, uh...  Now, you found another Bono?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, actually, uh...  Wait, you found another Bono?  The search for Joe's Bono...  I didn't realize there were so many Bonos out there.  ...the lead singer from Nine Days, um...  Brian DeVoe.  What happened to the other one?  Yeah.  He, uh...  He, um...  He really doesn't...  Just doesn't want to do it anymore.  He's not, uh... 
[03:07:30]  He's not feeling Bono-ish anymore.  Not feeling Bono-ish.  Musical differences?  Creative differences?  Creative differences.  No, not even...  No, he's not a lad-type asshole, but, you know, he's just, uh...  It's something that he didn't feel like doing anymore.  He wants to go to art school, move to Florida, so...  Maybe he's the only one with some sense in his head.  Uh, where are you playing?  Oh, uh, this weekend.  Tonight is a free show at the Pittsburgh Hard Rock Cafe.  Yeah, but that isn't, uh...  With the new Bono?  No, no, no.  No, we have the, uh... 
[03:08:00]  We have the, uh...  Uh, the old Bono, it's his last two shows.  He was amazing, too.  Right, tomorrow.  How bummed were you when he came to you and said he doesn't want to continue?  Because you guys have been blowing up.  Um, uh, not...  You know what, man?  It happens all the time, and, uh, the new guy that we have is, uh, you know, every bit, uh, the Bono is the old one.  It's, it's really, it's really an entirely, uh, different scene when you're, when you're making other people's music.  It doesn't impact the band as much as it, uh, as you would think it would. 
[03:08:30]  When you change other people, you just switch them around.  It's still a tribute band.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm the only original member.  There have been, there have been 48 members of, uh, two years.  Yeah, it's like Spinal Tap.  Oh, that's funny.  You don't have to worry about it.  What about when we write the song?  Oh, yeah, that's right.  Yeah, that's right.  We don't.  Wasn't he the songwriter?  No, Bono's the songwriter.  The only thing you have to worry is if the real Bono quits you, too.  Well, you know, I'd be looking for the real edge to quit you, too.  Now, Joe, where's the crazy places that you're playing?  Well, on, uh, this is coming Saturday, we're going to be down in, um, Trinidad. 
[03:09:00]  Trinidad.  Trinidad, yeah.  Uh, actually, there are four other bands, and, uh, they're from, uh, a couple of them are from  Long Island, um, uh, uh, uh, Journey Tribute that's, um, that's going down there.  Does Trinidad really need a Journey Tribute to come down there?  Uh, yeah, they do.  Actually, they need any type of tribute they can get.  There's five bands.  It's, uh...  Trinidad is a hot spot for Long Island bands.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a no-doubt tribute called No-duh. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, I, I heard some clips of them.  No, but where's the real stupid place you're playing?  Uh, Honduras.  Honduras.  Yeah, we're playing...  Why the fuck?  July 22nd.  Are you going to Honduras?  How do you get to Honduras?  Wasn't there a war going on?  The last I heard, there was a war going on in Honduras.  Yeah.  Oh, man, I got my man, Charlie Martino, down there.  Joe, you're coming down to Honduras, right?  That's like one of those places there's, like, mobs with, like, machetes.  They pay really well.  There's cantaloupe in the street.  People just don't fuck with me. 
[03:10:00]  They'll push, like, some other Bono guy out of a helicopter and hang him and show you.  You'll see that son of a bitch?  I never trusted him.  You did that because Sosa says so?  Because Sosa says so.  You're going to be held hostage.  I know, that's what's going to happen.  And we're going to have to have a fundraiser.  Yeah.  We'll just have a...  We'll sell t-shirts.  I'm telling you, man, nobody...  I've been in some pretty questionable countries and some tight spots, and nobody fucks with me.  You look at them like you're fucking crazy, and it just doesn't matter. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, well, they are crazy.  Yeah.  Yeah, they are.  Well, best of luck to you, Joe.  Yes.  And remember, tonight at the Pittsburgh Hard Rock Cafe free show with 2U.  You should have called this morning when we were on in Pittsburgh.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I heard it.  I was driving.  I was getting my shit together, getting ready and stuff, so...  All right, Joe.  All right, gentlemen.  I will speak with you soon.  And the Beach Boys tribute band with Mike Love and Al Jardine is pretty good. 
[03:11:00]  All right, cool.  Because it's the real guy.  Well, here's the audio from this morning.  The Beach Boys.  This is a big day for a Southern California music institution.  Today, the surviving founders of the Beach Boys made their first public appearance together  in 10 years.  Ryan Wilson, Mike Love and Al Jardine, plus veteran band member Bruce Johnston and former Beach  Boy David Marks gathered on the roof of the Capitol Records building in Hollywood.  Unfortunately, not to jump.  They're celebrating the 40th anniversary of their landmark Pet Sounds album. 
[03:11:30]  And the fact that their 2003 Sounds of Summer album has gone double platinum after spending  an astonishing 155 weeks on Billboard's charts.  And I thank the Beach Boys themselves for being great, great artists to produce.  I would rather produce those guys over any other artists in the whole world.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Great.  This Beach Boys reunion comes after years of animosity and lawsuit between Wilson and  Love.  Love hinted they've been resolved over time. 
[03:12:00]  A second Greatest Hits compilation is planned now for next spring.  Wow.  Just still raking in the cash.  Who cares?  How many Greatest Hits can you put out?  Oh, yeah.  We forgot these outtakes.  Yeah.  Isn't there only one Greatest Hits album in anybody, really?  Because it's got to be the Greatest Hits.  Not just Hits.  Greatest Hits.  And then the next Greatest.  Here are the ones that didn't make the Greatest Hits.  Didn't make the Greatest Hits, so it's kind of great hits.  I love when people get put out a CD and they have fucking eight versions of the same song, 
[03:12:30]  different outtakes.  Yeah, that's what you want to hear, man.  And you have to be a grade A musician to understand that.  Oh, yeah.  I realize.  He was playing the hi-hat in that part, not the ride cymbal.  Right.  You hear the difference?  Awful.  There's a different guitar sound in that one.  Huh?  What?  Really?  What's that?  Kind of seems like all the same song to me.  Was it worth buying this?  We missed a goal, people.  Now it's three to nothing.  Aw, it's over, Johnny.  Once you get three to nothing.  Keith, how's the motorcycle run going?  The Wow Motorcycle Run to Boston. 
[03:13:00]  Wow Motorcycle Run one week from today.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Next Wednesday.  Next Wednesday.  I'll tear it right here.  You guys putting on leather chaps and riding up to Mantown?  Absolutely.  Ass cheeks out.  Mantown or bust.  Yeah, just, it's coming along really well.  It's going up from here, 57th Street and 6th Avenue.  We're going to Bill's Bar up on Lansdow Street.  Leaving here at 6.30 in the morning, so get here a little early.  We're going to start assembling about 5.30.  And the route we're supposed to be taking will be 6.84 to 84 to 90. 
[03:13:30]  Sound about right for speed-wise?  I guess Roethlisberger ain't going to be joining you, huh?  No.  Roethlisberger.  No?  That's a late cancellation.  Yeah, late cancellation.  Can you imagine a person who ran into the...  Everybody in Pittsburgh's a Steelers fan.  The person who hit it probably got out with like a Roethlisberger jersey on.  Fucking asshole, why are we going?  Oh, shit.  Nah, it would have been great if we got out and did a sack dance. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  I heard it was some old lady.  Yeah.  It always is.  And they're saying, they're giving out her name.  Oh, no.  And they're worried that she's going to be like that dude in Chicago.  Death threats.  It's like it's an old fucking lady.  She shouldn't be driving.  Oh, she lived her life.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Life hog.  What's really left?  You life hog.  What's really left for her?  At least she gets an exciting death out of it.  Worked over.  Right.  Get her into a hotel room, duct tape her mouth. 
[03:14:30]  I would love to hear the audio of her as he was fucking coming flying at her.  Oh, my.  Oh, goodness.  All right, the info for the WOW motorcycle ride.  We did shoot for a couple of celebrity riders, like the boys from Orange County Chopper, but  they're filming.  And I guess Jesse James is married to Sandra Bullock, and he had to check with Sandra, and  she said no.  Oof.  See.  So, I knew that.  With the money she's making, you really have to do check with her.  And he'll say, all right, whatever.  Honey, can I ride my new custom motorcycle that you bought me? 
[03:15:00]  No.  No.  Okay.  No.  All right.  So, the list of attendees as far as ladies go.  Oh.  And the ladies.  The ladies.  The ladies.  We have Privileged Gentleman's Club on 23rd Street.  They're sending a bunch of girls to come.  Uncle Inky from his site, citystyle.com.  Uncle Inky.  If you want to go check out some of the girls on there, he's sending four or five girls.  Robin from mysexystore.com.  Oh, I thought you meant Robin.  Who has a very nice rack.  She's coming. 
[03:15:30]  Some of the Pal Talk girls.  Kara from MySpace.  Happy typing girl.  Wow.  So.  You scored Kara?  Yeah.  Nice.  There's a lot of finagling to get Kara down here, but she will be attending.  Lil, as I look at her on cam, her husband's not letting her go.  No.  So, Lil, sorry.  She won't make it.  Stalker Patty, of course.  Yeah.  Who we have yet to find somebody to take.  Oh, I like the sensation of the motorcycle vibrating.  The seat, it vibrates.  It makes me feel a little ticklish inside.  Yeah. 
[03:16:00]  That's what she was saying last time, remember?  The bike, she goes, oh, it tickles when the motor goes.  Does it?  Patty.  Virgin.  So, yeah, leaving here, like I said, 6.30.  A lot of the people have emailed me.  I've gotten probably over 150 emails.  A lot of people planning on attending.  So, do me a favor.  If you haven't, Keith at foundyourmusic.com.  Email me so I can get some paperwork out to you so we can get out of here on time, 6.30  a.m.  Ah, pre-doing the paperwork.  Pre-doing the paperwork.  Very smart.  Very smart this year. 
[03:16:30]  I think you should take Tippy Tom in blue.  That'd be fun, huh?  I feel like John Wilkes Booth.  This must be what he felt like right after he shot a blinking.  It's Stacks.  Stacks.  Stacks from Goodfellas.  Yeah, Stacks is out there eating Lay's potato chips.  Tom's dead.  Tom is not moving.  This happened one other time, and we thought he was dead.  Is he still breathing, at least?  I'm not going near him.  Where's Sam?  Tippy Tom is out cold.  And it looks like he's going to hurt his neck sleeping like that. 
[03:17:00]  There's like a question, man.  If you saw someone like Tom, and he needed mouth-to-mouth.  He's dying.  He's dying, right?  His life isn't worth as much as some attractive woman that you would then go,  Oh my God, I have to save her life with mouth-to-mouth.  Wait, get a mic out there.  We're talking to him.  He's not as important.  The best part was?  As a human being.  No, no.  A hot girl, as she blinks, you're like, Oh, she's unconscious.  Mouth-to-mouth.  Mouth-to-vagina. 
[03:17:30]  It's a new technique.  They've just, oh, you haven't heard this?  Yeah, you come from underneath the lungs.  Right.  It pushes the diaphragm up, which then gets the lungs moving with fresh air instead of  carbon dioxide that I'm breathing out.  So I'll breathe into your vagina.  Boy, that could work.  A lot of people don't know the uterus dies first when...  Right.  It needs more oxygen than your lungs do.  Give me gum.  Wait, wait.  Give me gum.  You're on the radio.  Oh, boy.  They're trying to wake Tom up.  Give me gum.  Wow, he's hitting on the head.  You know what?  That's his alarm clock.  Give me gum. 
[03:18:00]  Get a mic near Tom.  Get a...  Get the mic near Tom, too.  This is how he wakes up every morning.  Get him up.  He usually gets really mad when you wake him.  Give me gum.  Oh, God.  He's touching his face.  Oh, he's ripping his ear off.  Ripping at his ear.  Smack him on the neck.  They're dropping water on him.  They're dropping water.  Is he dead?  I don't know how he says.  How do you feel, Tom?  All right. 
[03:18:30]  Now you woke me up now.  Now I got to talk.  All right.  Now, here's my name.  You should wake him up like a private pile.  Then you should just walk away.  Wait, wait.  I'm trying to listen.  But I am the real Timber Tom.  And the all...  He's thinking Timber Tom.  He's thinking Timber Tom.  I am the real Timber Tom.  Unlike these other fake...  Blue.  Have you ever seen a fake Timber Tom?  Have you ever heard anyone claim what it would be?  It sounds like the beginning of a rap album.  I've seen blue for a moment. 
[03:19:00]  I'm Timber Tom on these fake motherfuckers.  Then the music kicks in.  Well, I'm Timber Tom.  I am the real Timber Tom.  I am the real Timber Tom.  I am the real Timber Tom.  I am the real Timber Tom.  Goal!  Holy shit, it happened.  Goal!  You actually saw a goal?  What is it now?  Four something?  Look at it.  There's a guy laying on the ground.  I love you dearly.  The thing is this is that you better behave yourself because...  Yeah, now I'll tell your sister. 
[03:19:30]  Stella.  Oh!  Head to head.  All right.  Enough with that.  Nothing's going on out there.  Chris in New York.  All right.  Thank you.  Go back to sleep.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  You're pissing off all six World Cup fans in the United States.  It's not four zip.  It's not four nothing.  It's four nil.  Nil.  Oh, that's right.  It's actually three nil because they disallowed it.  It's three zed.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  It's nil, not zero.  Let's take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:20:00]  Bill Burr...  Bill Burr.  Blue is trying to get into the studio.  What's going on, Ben?  The best part, the best line of this whole thing was right before we just went out there  with the mic.  Could you get him out of here?  Could you get the savage out of the studio, please?  Get him out of here.  Look, he's looking at the white women pictures we got up.  Don't look at all white women.  Yeah, those are all white women.  That's all white women.  I can put some sisters on the wall.  Put some up there.  Put some sisters on the wall? 
[03:20:30]  Maybe you got some Venus Williams.  What sisters would you like to see on the wall?  Donna Ross.  Diana Ross.  Diana Ross.  Fucking grandma.  Marilyn McHugh.  Marilyn McHugh.  I told you he came out in the 70s.  Oh, Tina Turner.  Tina Turner.  Tina Turner.  She's 17.  Tina Turner.  Tina Turner.  No way.  Josephine Baker.  Oh, it was...  What the hell? 
[03:21:00]  45.  What about, like, Beyonce and shit?  Who's that?  You ain't into Beyonce?  Uh, she's a little bit of breakdancing and all that and that.  Breakdancing?  This guy's not a table ever.  The newest reference he has is breakdancing.  She's too fast for me.  She's too fast for you?  Yeah, she got to slow it up.  Yeah?  Yeah, you like it's slow down.  What about Halle Berry and shit?  Slow down a bit.  She's just half black, but what about Halle Berry?  He likes girls who still do the mashed potato.  Halle Berry.  Yeah.  She's good?  You don't know who Halle Berry is? 
[03:21:30]  No.  Yeah.  She's half white, though.  I don't know.  How about Dorothy Danridge?  Ella Fitzgerald.  What about Ella?  Yeah, Billie Holiday.  Exactly.  Billie, oh!  Damn, Billie Holiday.  Billie Holiday.  What?  Billie Holiday, huh?  Yeah.  How about Dionne Warwick?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's a hot one, huh?  Yeah.  Gladys Knight.  I love her.  Gladys Knight and her pips. 
[03:22:00]  Aretha Franklin.  You're a pip?  Yeah.  Do the Midnight Train to Georgia.  Go ahead.  Give us a little.  You want it?  Yeah.  Give us a little Midnight Train to Georgia.  On Midnight Train to Georgia.  Leave it on a Midnight Train.  Midnight Train to Georgia.  And then you gotta go, woo, woo.  Choo-choo.  Exactly.  He's just like a pip.  Oof.  Oh, Bill, you all right over there? 
[03:22:30]  Bill just got a coughing fit.  What are you?  Yeah, that's yours.  We'll have a stack.  Look at how he moves it with a pen like a cop.  Doesn't want to touch the fingerprints.  Bill Burr.  Bill Burr.  All right, we'll tell you.  He wants to be touched.  No, no, no, no.  Ben, why are you giving him a DVD?  I don't know.  What the hell is he going to play it in?  He touched it.  You want to touch it now?  No.  You don't want to know.  I don't want to.  Yeah.  What are you going to play it in?  Yeah, touch it.  That's the way you cure the homeless problem.  You just walk up and touch somebody's house.  Go ahead, take it.  I ain't going to touch it.  Take it.  I don't want it.  I take that one.  Yeah?  The TV.  He wants the TV. 
[03:23:00]  All right, if you can get that TV out of here, it's yours.  How does that sound?  Oh, boy, don't give him that option.  Look at him.  He's broken a cop's hand already.  Nope, that's why I went to jail, okay?  All right, Blue's out of here.  All right, Blue.  Let's take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  California, rest in peace.  Time will take me up in peace.  California, do your teeth.  She's my priestess. 
[03:23:30]  I'm your priest.  Yeah, yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus, the 2006 comedy event of the year.  If you don't know what this is about yet, go to opieandanthony.com for all the info, okay?  Roy, tickets go on sale Friday at 9 a.m. through Ticketmaster.  We have all the lineups and the cities we're playing in.  Hopefully, we'll add a few more.  Dude, I came up with that.  I think we should go to Washington. 
[03:24:00]  I think we could go to Washington, even though we're not on a commercial radio station down there.  I think we have enough support down there to make it happen, but we'll have to wait and see, okay?  Hey, we're going to end the show today with Homeless Radio.  We'll be out of studios, so don't worry about it, Anthony.  I think we'll have Tippi Tom and Blue do the last 10, 15 minutes of the show today.  All right, well...  We're talking about the hot topics of the day.  I'll tell you what.  See this microphone?  Yeah, that's the one they're going to use.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Sure it is.  If this is the one they're going to use, I quit the show.  I just...  I would have to.  There's no other solution.  They...  If I add your salary to my salary...  Oh, boy.  That would be...  Yours?  I could get out of my apartment finally.  Hey, have fun.  Have fun.  I'm almost ready to friggin' retire.  The incompetence we've got to deal with on a daily basis. 
[03:25:00]  Please.  Whoa, what happened?  Oh.  I went through it yesterday.  Oh, that.  Went through it today.  When are you looking to parachute out of this business?  This is our last run.  This is your last one?  This is our last run.  Our last run.  If we screw up and get fired, it's over.  I'm content.  I'll get a house in Arizona somewhere, get a job at some small radio station,  and just talk about, you know,  what about the, you know,  you see what the Pope did today?  He was talking about blah, blah, blah.  One of those bad talk shows you just hear someone yapping.  Yeah. 
[03:25:30]  I've often thought about that.  Like, if you...  Just after a while, this fucking travel, doing stand-up and shit,  you just get that one payday and...  And then just stop.  This is it.  Yeah, but then I'd just be sitting around waiting to die.  Fucking curse.  Any day could be our last show.  Do radio.  And when we do our last show, we're doing our last show.  I know that sounds so profound.  Profound.  I'd do radio after this.  But like I said, it would be such a non...  Like, I wouldn't worry about...  Like, right now, I worry if we're doing a good show,  if, you know, people are enjoying it,  if we're being successful. 
[03:26:00]  I would just get a job based on the fact that I'm Anthony  from the Opie and Anthony show.  So I'm going to go,  Oh, Anthony.  Hey, we'll do it.  And I'll just sit there and take you calls all day.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Yeah, what do you think about that?  Yeah?  Blah, blah, blah.  And you know when we'd usually cut people off?  I wouldn't.  I would just watch the clock.  All right.  Tick, tock, tick.  I don't care.  Whatever.  Something to do all day.  Yap about anything.  How about that, President Bush?  People, what do you think?  Give me a call.  Hey, hey, what's your favorite topping on ice cream?  You like the sprinkles, chocolate or multicolored? 
[03:26:30]  Give me a call.  Anthony's downplaying it.  He would be a great, like, Rush Limbaugh slash Sean Hannity  slash name other douchebag here.  Well, that might be fun.  Other douchebag.  I'm kidding.  Actually, he's downplaying it.  He would be great with the political talks.  I think I might have to do that, like, after, you know,  this whole thing's over.  I think my credibility might be...  Just one day, you just smell the last homeless guy you want to smell.  And that's it.  It's going to be interesting.  Get up and walk out.  It's going to be interesting how this ends. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  It's going to be interesting.  Sonny Farrelly, what's up?  Hey, I got this story here.  I really didn't want to tell it, but here it goes.  It's about fucking Mantown.  Oh, we were talking about Mantown earlier today, of course.  Mantown.  Yeah, I was there at a mall doing some electrical work, and I had to really take a dump.  So I used their bathroom at the food court.  I'm sitting there just doing my fucking business, minding my own fucking business, and some fucking  asshole sends a fucking note underneath the fucking bathroom stall. 
[03:27:30]  Nice cock.  And I fucking...  Oh, my God.  I got so fucking scared.  Like, and then all of a sudden, I look up, and there's this fucking beady little eyes  fucking looking over me.  Wait, where was he looking?  Was there a hole?  No, no.  He was literally over the stall, over the wall, looking at me.  Ugh.  What comedy club was Jimmy playing at that night?  That sounds like something Norton would do.  I looked at him.  The scary part about it is I looked at him back, and he fucking just scared away, man.  And I just fucking... 
[03:28:00]  I didn't even wipe.  I put my fucking pants on, and I fucking had cranky apps for the rest of the day.  Ugh.  Disgusting.  Well, why didn't you fucking go someplace else and finish?  Should have gave the guy a treat and let him watch your wipe.  That would have taken care of the situation.  And he said, nice cock.  He wanted yours.  You know, it doesn't make you gay.  No, you know something, now that I think about it, I should have felt pretty good about  it.  You'd be flattered.  I'm punching out.  All right, Sonny.  Thanks for the Mantown story.  Hey, Sonny, I want to thank you for volunteering to take Patty on the motorcycle run. 
[03:28:30]  I really appreciate you stepping up.  Thank you.  No way.  No way.  Leave Stalker Patty home.  Or make her ride the Chinatown to Chinatown bus.  What is it, $10 to Boston?  Oh, what do they call that bus?  It's, I don't know.  Is this the Chinatown bus?  The dollar bus?  Chinatown to Chinatown.  It's the cheapest way to get to Boston.  All right, AOL customer service call, cancelling account.  Steve brought this to our attention today. 
[03:29:00]  What's up, man?  Funwa.  What?  It's the funwa bus.  Funwa?  Funwa.  Funwurst.  They run chickens down on the bottom of it, too.  All right.  Customer calls AOL customer service to cancel his account.  And customer service rep proceeds for about four minutes to convince this determined young  man to keep the service.  Dude, I went through this.  I've had AOL for years after I stopped using it.  I used AOL for probably two years back in Boston. 
[03:29:30]  And then just, you know, got an internet provider.  And then that's it.  Yeah, I'm done with AOL as well.  I haven't used it in, I can't tell you.  I check my mail on AOL maybe once every three months at this point.  I wasn't using it for years.  Dude, I went five years without using it.  So how do you cancel it?  You have to call up?  Then you got to call up.  So I'm like, I kept noticing it on my Amex.  And I'm like, you know, there's a number right here.  Let me call this.  So I called up customer service. 
[03:30:00]  And what you have to go through to cancel, they will try.  And I said, I got to the point where I was saying, look, don't try to keep me.  I want this canceled.  There is nothing you are going to say.  Oh, but they have an answer for that.  But they have an answer for that.  Exactly.  Because there are people sat down with these phone operators.  And then.  They're going to say there's nothing they want.  The next month, it was still on my bill.  So I called back livid again.  And the guy is telling me, well, this, no, I have no record that you even tried to cancel. 
[03:30:30]  You know what's doing that to me right now?  Motherfuckers.  Sports Illustrated.  Really?  I got a subscription because, you know, we won a couple of championships.  At least that can run out if you don't pay it.  I just, I've called them three fucking times.  I don't want it anymore.  I don't want it.  Every year when they have their swimsuit edition, they always talk about people who canceled their subscription.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been trying for fucking, three times they call them.  I don't want it.  I don't want it.  Well, I'm really sorry to hear about that.  Okay.  You got it in the system?  Got it in the system.  Next week, another fucking thing comes.  I just never read it. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  It's in the system, indeed.  There's no system.  There's someone there just bullshitting you.  And what do you do?  It gets another, you know, gets another little payment out of you.  And they're not accountable.  I think I already paid them.  Oh, you did?  You paid up?  I thought you paid that up front.  I don't think it's on my credit card.  They just keep sending me that fuck.  And I get livid every Wednesday.  Stop it.  Enough.  Well, we got some audio.  Oh, I've been through this.  So you've been through this whole thing.  All right, so the guy calls, wants to cancel, and they're trying to convince him not to cancel, 
[03:31:30]  to convince this determined young man to keep the service, which he does not want.  Is this you?  Is this audio of you, possibly?  I know.  It really, the two bicker back and forth until ultimately the AOL rep goes into a lengthy sales pitch  and the customer hangs up on the phone.  That's the problem.  You hang up on the phone.  You're not canceled.  No, you're not canceled.  So they're just trying to get their gimmick.  They're trying to scrape a few extra months out of you.  I bet you this is something they do with customer service.  AOL was training wheels for the internet. 
[03:32:00]  It was training wheels.  When people first started, they didn't know how to navigate.  There's so many different websites and stuff.  So AOL was the place you went where you were then able to find things.  Wait a minute.  I actually canceled mine, and they talked me into keeping my email through them.  So I'm probably still getting charged.  You're still getting charged something.  Get the, really?  I bet you are.  Oh, it was hoarse.  And it was a place to go to find things.  Because, you know, the internet was like the Wild West.  Well, they organized it nice for you.  They organized it.  After a while, you realized you grew up and grew out of it. 
[03:32:30]  You didn't need it anymore.  I can navigate the web safely without AOL.  I could get email.  I could do anything.  I could do videos.  I could get everything I need without AOL.  So they're losing customers because a lot of people are realizing this also.  And I guess they don't want to lose customers so quickly.  So they make it so difficult to cancel that people get this pissed off.  All right.  And then finally, it says, not funny, but infuriating in terms of how these reps do not facilitate the process of canceling an account. 
[03:33:00]  See, I could read much better later in the morning.  Facilitate?  I got through facilitate.  Very good.  Thank you, Anthony.  Hi, this is John at AOL.  How may I help you today?  I wanted to cancel my account.  Sorry to hear that.  Yeah, very sorry.  Pull your account up here real quick.  Can I have your name?  They're always sorry.  Oh, sorry to hear that.  Just start off.  Okay, sorry to hear that.  But we'll get through this.  Yeah.  We'll get through.  We're going to get through this thing.  Keep your chin up.  Punch up your account.  Punch up your account.  Here they go. 
[03:33:30]  And he's off.  Start the circus music.  Here you go.  Plan C12B.  Plan C12.  Like, they probably have a book, a code book they go to.  Right.  We have a cancellation.  Cancellation.  We have a cancellation.  Get me the book.  Get me the book.  And then the guy comes over, opens it up, and they run through the script.  Just to annoy you.  Start over.  Hi, this is John at AOL.  How may I help you today?  I wanted to cancel my account.  Sorry to hear that.  Go ahead and pull your account up here real quick. 
[03:34:00]  Can I have your name, please?  Vincent.  Hey, Vincent.  Vincent Peep.  For privacy and security, can I have the last four digits of your payment method, please?  All right.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  You've had this account for a long time?  Yep.  It's just quite a bit.  What was causing you to turn this off today?  I just don't use it anymore.  Do you have a high-speed connection, like a DSL or cable?  Yep.  Okay.  How long have you had that?  Years.  Years.  Okay.  This is my...  Let me tell you something.  I'm not shitting you at all. 
[03:34:30]  This is my conversation with the guy.  Because they follow a script.  It's exactly the same.  They follow a script.  Because he asked me, you know, it's been a long...  Wow, you've had this a long time.  Because I've been paying every month for five years.  Even though you haven't...  Without using it once.  I forgot my password and logon years ago.  We can get that for you, sir.  Five years.  Yeah, we'll get that for you.  If that's your only problem, five years I was paying.  Every month, paying.  And how much a month?  What is it?  I don't even know.  15?  15, 20 maybe?  Something like that. 
[03:35:00]  Every month for five years.  So he was like, wow, long time.  Yeah.  Oh, do you have the high speed?  Can I...  Yes, I got it.  I live in 2006 here.  I have it.  Who does...  Who is still dialing up?  Please beat yourself over the head with your rotary phone.  It's got to be an easy way.  It's got to be some kind of...  Who the hell...  I couldn't get in touch with you.  Oh, I was on the internet.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Remember that?  What was the phone?  It was busy for like two hours.  I was on the internet, in the information superhighway. 
[03:35:30]  I was on that thing.  What is that?  Oh, it plugs in.  My computer uses the phone.  That's like the future.  Right.  And the second an option became available with that, you didn't need that anymore, you  got it.  Even back then, you got a separate line.  Right.  Some kind of separate phone line that just used that.  Because you remember when you used to call up for help and they'd be like, okay, go on  the internet.  You don't even think and you unplug your phone.  I can.  And then you're like, oh, they got me. 
[03:36:00]  Does your phone line use the same...  Is your computer and phone on the same line?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now we got a problem.  You got to go to our website and navigate.  What you're going to have to do, write this down and then hang up with me and run through  it.  Do you have a cell phone?  Go through.  Put in...  No, it's 1990.  Hit start.  Go S-Y-S-O-P...  Sorry.  At least give me that so I know you're at least listening.  The common courtesy to give me a car crash, damn it. 
[03:36:30]  Ignore me.  I won't be ignored.  So that sounds exactly like the conversation I had.  There's got to be a way to make them go into hyperspeed to cancel your service.  Nope.  I'm thinking.  Like you just go...  If they go, what's the problem?  Go, I download child porn and I'm in rehab.  All over AOL.  Right.  Yeah, I was arrested.  Did you see me on Dateline?  I was arrested for child porn.  I download it all the time.  I'm in rehab.  I need to stop this immediately. 
[03:37:00]  Okay, you're canceled, sir.  All right.  All right, you're off.  There's one button we hit here and you're canceled.  There's got to be...  What sites are you going to?  Do you have high speed?  There's got to be just one of those situations where they go, okay, there's nothing we can do here.  All right, here's the...  I just took sleeping pills and alcohol and I should be dead in 10 minutes, so I want to cancel my account.  Right.  There's got to be a way.  Yeah, some kind of gimmick.  We've got to help everybody out.  We've got to figure out how to get through the system.  Yeah, what the line is. 
[03:37:30]  What the line is.  Yeah, to just get them to cancel you immediately without the sales pitch.  What's the problem, sir?  Bestiality!  Bestiality!  I love it.  Can't get enough horse fucking videos.  And there's none on AOL.  And I can't stop watching it because of you people and I'm considering suing you.  And I don't want to get to that level.  All right, you don't have to.  You're canceled.  Yeah, maybe you bring up a lawsuit.  Look at my account.  You see how many times I wrote bestiality into your search engine?  Do you understand?  I've got a problem here.  Yeah, this is my conversation. 
[03:38:00]  Well, actually, I'm showing a lot of usage on this account.  Yeah, a long time ago.  Not recently.  Oh, the boss's account was on 71 hours since the 24th of last month.  No, he wasn't.  He doesn't even have the AOL software.  No, it's great.  I can see these guys playing it the other way, too.  Oh, you want to cancel the service.  Do you realize that you were in the chat room?  Oh, yeah.  Trolling for young boys. 
[03:38:30]  Trolling for young boys.  You were also in older men with fat cocks looking for young girls.  You do realize on June 8th, 2000, you were in a room for men searching for young boys.  And then I'm showing two hours spent in the room by curious looking for same.  What is this hairlessballsack.com that keeps popping up?  You know, I really do use your service a lot, and I'm even willing to pay a little more per month. 
[03:39:00]  Right.  I got you by the ball.  No kidding.  I would be like, what the fuck business is it of yours?  How often?  And why are you telling me how many hours I spend on this thing?  Downwiththejews.net.  That's an interesting one.  Yeah, looking at that one.  I'm sure there's some people that would love to see that.  Looks like you like to spend a lot of time in the chat room.  I'm sexually confused.  I'm sure your wife, Mary, and your sons, Jack and Tommy, would love to see what sites you've been to. 
[03:39:30]  I'll send it to their address.  Never mind, never mind, never mind.  Okay, keep me.  Sorry.  Wrong number, wrong number.  Prank caller, prank caller.  I love the service so much you can charge me double.  Oh, manaperape.org.  That would be funny.  You can kind of hear it, though, because you can hear it in this guy's voice.  Yeah, the guy's being a little smarmy.  Yeah, listen.  There we go.  Not recently.  Oh, that's the posture account.  Oh, shit. 
[03:40:00]  I want to go back.  He's like, well, let me tell you how often you've been on, fucko.  Right.  What a prick.  How have you had that?  Years.  Years.  Okay.  Well, actually, I'm showing a lot of usage on this account.  Yeah, a long time ago.  Not recently.  That is so fucking irritating.  It was on 71 hours since the 24th of last month.  No, he wasn't.  He doesn't even have the AOL software installed on his computer.  You're looking at AIM usage, probably.  No, AIM usage doesn't come onto this. 
[03:40:30]  He doesn't have the AOL software installed on his computer.  Oh, my God.  This is your father, man?  Yep.  Okay.  Could you hit that a minute?  Because I just got a bitch at line one.  If this is what he thinks, I'm going to...  Okay.  He's joking.  All right.  All right, Tom.  That's funny.  You see, all I saw is, hey, why are you bleeping on X?  And I didn't see the joking part.  Go ahead with your joke, Tom.  Do your joke.  Hey, Tom.  He was waiting.  Tom.  Do your joke, Tom.  Come on.  Actually, I'm paying for it, and I'm hearing beeps. 
[03:41:00]  I don't want to hear the beeps.  It's very funny.  All right, thanks, Tom.  Thanks, Tom.  By the way, there's personal info there, so we have to bleep no matter what.  Yeah, that's why it's bleeped.  It's personal info.  Man, this guy's an ass, though.  What a dick.  Let me tell you a few other things about your father.  I so lose my shit, and I'm actually getting angry, and I have nothing at stake here.  I completely lose it with these people.  Yeah, it's like, dude, what the fuck difference does it make?  Does it matter what I get?  If I was on 1,800 fucking hours in the past 1,800 hours, I want to cancel this. 
[03:41:30]  Now.  I'm looking at this account.  Either way, whatever you're saying.  Well, what's causing me to want to turn this off today?  I mean, obviously, I mean...  I don't use it, and he doesn't use it, so we're canceling.  I'm telling you, he doesn't use the account.  The software is not even on his computer.  Well, okay.  I mean, is there a problem with the software itself?  No, I don't use it.  I don't need it.  I don't want it.  I just don't need it anymore. 
[03:42:00]  So when you use it, so I'm going to use the computer, I'm saying.  Is that for business?  These guys have been trained to do this.  Is it for business?  It's for canceling AOL.  Yeah.  That's what I use it for now.  I just want to jump in on this phone call.  I so want to just tell the guy, look, hey, pussy, why aren't you just laying into this guy?  No, you can't do that, because then they can hang up on you.  No, I'd tell the other guy.  Oh, to the other guy, the other guy, okay.  He's being a faggot.  I would just be a robot, cancel my account, cancel my account, cancel, don't engage in 
[03:42:30]  conversation.  Yeah, because he's just going to try the sales pitch.  That's what they've been trained to do.  Oh, what an ass.  Engage in conversation.  Is that for business or for school?  Dude, what difference does it make?  I don't want the AOL account anymore.  Can we please cancel it?  Well, on June 2nd, this account was signed on.  It's been on for 72 hours.  On June 2nd.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  Last year was 540, last month was 545 hours of usage.  I don't know how to make this any clearer, so I'm just going to say it one last time.  Cancel the account, please. 
[03:43:00]  Well, explain to me what's, what, why.  I'm not explaining anything to you.  Cancel the account.  Well, what's the matter, man?  I mean, we're just, I'm just trying to help here.  You're not helping me.  You're helping me with the cancel.  I am trying to help.  Okay.  Helping me, listen.  I called to cancel the account.  Helping me would be canceling the account.  Please help me and cancel my account.  No, I wouldn't, actually.  Cancel my account.  Or not your account.  Cancel the account.  Come on.  The worst thing to.  Cancel the account.  Is your dad there?  My dad, I'm the primary person on the account, not my dad. 
[03:43:30]  Cancel the account.  Yeah, because I'm just trying to figure out.  Cancel the account.  Oh, he did do it.  Good.  I don't know how to make this any clearer for you.  Cancel the account.  The card is mine in my name.  The account is mine and in my name.  When I say cancel the account, I don't mean help me figure out how to keep it.  I mean cancel the account.  Well, I'm sorry.  I don't know what anybody's done to you, Vincent, but this is kind of...  You're annoying the shit out of me.  That's what you're doing to me.  Cancel the account, please.  Okay.  Now, that goes both ways, my friend.  Good. 
[03:44:00]  Oh!  Because I'm all...  All right.  Someday, when you calm down, you're going to realize,  All I was trying to do was help you, and it was actually in your best interest to listen.  Wonderful.  Okay, yeah, great.  When that epiphany happens, then just give us a call back every time.  Wait.  As a process or cancellation request,  I have got a free benefit available for valued members like yourself.  Wow.  We'll continue to provide you some features available.  Don't want it.  I know the drill.  I don't even want it.  Don't even bother.  If you want me to cancel this account, you're going to let me speak and give this paragraph. 
[03:44:30]  Okay?  Oh!  Because if not, we can star you all day.  I really don't care, to be honest with you.  But you're going to listen to me, if you want to turn it off.  So, can I speak now?  Go right ahead.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Are you running your mind?  No.  No.  You see, I don't listen to anything.  I'll...  Ugh.  You've got to just be...  Dude, I'll call the fucking news.  I'll send this tape in.  Infuriating, yeah.  Better Business Bureau, there's got to be something you can fucking bring up.  No, you're going to listen to me.  No, I'm not.  No, customer service.  Cancel the account.  They have you by the balls these days. 
[03:45:00]  That was good.  They have you by the balls.  That was a good line.  Someday, when you calm down, you're going to realize...  What did he say?  You're going to realize that you made a mistake or whatever.  It's like a dude getting dumped by a chick.  Right.  And so I said, someday, let me tell you something.  You're going to realize that was the best thing that ever happened to you.  Thank you.  Appreciate that.  Thank you.  As a process, you can't place your quest.  But to pay about a free benefit available from value members like yourself,  we will continue to provide you some features of the AOL service, 
[03:45:30]  even after the membership has been canceled.  At AOL.com, you can keep your existing email, buddy list, address book, and more  at no cost for as long as you like.  There's no catch.  This is AOL's way of continuing our relationship with you.  We know you'll enjoy keeping your same email.  Just go to AOL.com, log into the screen name and password.  An email confirming the cancellation will be delivered to your free AOL.com email  for 24 hours.  He hung up somewhere in there? 
[03:46:00]  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, that's what they're telling me.  Somewhere in there.  I bet it wasn't canceled.  No, the guy gave up and hung up.  I'm thinking maybe mine isn't canceled.  I bet it wasn't canceled, that guy.  I bet he had a call again.  God.  Because that's the same conversation I had.  How bad do you want to strangle that guy?  The guy was talking about, you know, we have high-speed internet.  That whole thing, I have to listen to a sales pitch before I can't.  No, I don't.  Yeah, before I cancel?  I don't.  That's our policy.  I really don't care.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're out of here. 
[03:46:30]  We're going to have Blue and Tippy Tom.  Oh, great.  We've got to do this fast.  Make sure.  So they don't cut this up during the replay.  Over there.  Yeah, they'll be over here.  Clear the phone lines.  Homeless Radio is next with Tippy Tom.  Clear the field.  And Blue.  They're going to be discussing some of the topics of the day,  including World Cup soccer, Alzerkawi, Bush going to Baghdad.  Baghdad, excuse me.  Patrick Kennedy.  Katrina Fund Fraud.  We should have talked about that today.  We should have talked about that tomorrow, actually.  Or maybe we'll get some ideas from them. 
[03:47:00]  And other things on your mind.  So if you've got a hot topic for Tippy Tom and Blue,  give us a call right now for Homeless Radio.  Okay, Bill Burr, thanks.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Okay.  Thank you.  Caroline, if you're not going to be joining us for tomorrow's radio show.  Yeah, I'll be at Caroline's Thursday through Sunday this week,  15th through the 18th.  Right.  All the information's up on myspace.com slash Bill Burr.  Right.  And that's the deal.  Caroline's Comedy Club.  Keith.  Do we have a little filler?  Tippy Tom's taking a shit. 
[03:47:30]  Are you kidding?  Oh, great.  Oh, I looked up while the fucking cancer guy was swabbing his blowhole.  Oh, have I had it with that guy.  People are quitting smoking like crazy because of our new hero on TV.  I'm turning him into the FCC.  Where's that article?  We'll save that for tomorrow.  Someone grab that from the New York Post today?  Yeah, New Yorkers.  They're just like throwing their cigarettes out the windows.  All right, here's the deal.  You'll see that commercial.  Get the wireless mic into the bathroom.  When the commercials are over, we start with Tippy Tom, wherever the hell he is, okay?  Homeless radio with Tippy Tom and Blue Necks. 
[03:48:00]  Than will be sitting in.  Than is playing the straight guy here.  He's the one, he's playing, he's got a role where he's just trying to keep the show going.  Because people start trashing Than, like, he's not saying much.  Because he's not part of it.  He's just kind of making sure they don't sit there and piss on the microphones like fucking monkeys.  Than isn't homeless.  And he's the one that's kind of producing it and making sure the phone calls come in with the right things to ask and such.  And lead them in the proper direction.  Exactly.  So leave Than alone.  Leave him alone. 
[03:48:30]  Homeless radio next.  All right.  We're back with homeless radio.  Hold on, Tom.  I'm going to give you a big intro and then you can, you can't hear.  Somebody turn off his headphones, please.  All right.  We got homeless radio with Blue and Tippy Tom.  All right.  Let's turn on his mic so we can start yelling at all of you.  What's up, Tom?  Well, what's up is this?  Is, um, well, I'm mad at my mom. 
[03:49:00]  Why are you mad at your mom, Tom?  Well, because she was not nice to me one day.  And, because I didn't take out the garbage and I was on restriction.  The garbage?  You eat the garbage.  Well, anyway, other than that, I can't blame her for anything else. 
[03:49:30]  No, no, my mom is wonderful.  She's wonderful, huh?  Yes, right.  All right.  God bless her.  Now, what's up with you?  And she's a gorgeous blonde.  I'm blonde.  I look up at my mom.  I'm a blonde-haired mother.  Lucky her.  Uh, yeah.  I come after her.  I look like her. 
[03:50:00]  Now, my mom is real powerful in the community in Jersey, but...  She's in the mob?  My mother, yes.  Yeah, my mom's here.  All right, we're going to...  You got a mom, right?  Yes.  Used to.  Um, she...  We're going to talk about today's hot topics.  You guys ready?  You guys follow the news?  Let's get all the moms off.  What's the news today?  All right, let's talk about, um, Iraq. 
[03:50:30]  Iraq.  Blue, what do you think about the Iraq situation?  The Iraqis?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold on, Ted, Ted, Ted.  Hold on.  What do I think about the Iraqi situation?  I think they should stop blowing us up, okay?  All right.  What do you think...  I ain't down there.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  What do you think...  How do you think Bush is handling it?  Bush...  Bush...  Bush...  Bush... 
[03:51:00]  Bush...  What do you think about that?  You know, I'm sick of this talk.  What do you think happened when the United States dropped two nuclear bombs?  Big bombs.  Where are they dropping them at?  Japan?  Rotate.  Well, they're blowing them up too.  Nagasaki.  When the Japanese were fighting, what do the Americans do? 
[03:51:30]  Drop bombs on them.  The big bombs.  No, no, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Dude, that motherfucker's up.  Before he died.  When did he die?  Pardon me, before he died.  Wait, Reagan.  Reagan.  Anybody know by Reagan?  He's a president.  Ex-president. 
[03:52:00]  Give us a beer.  Can somebody get Tom a beer?  I have a beer here.  That was funny.  Tom, do you think we should drop bombs or shouldn't?  No.  No.  No bombs at all.  Unless they bomb us first.  Drop middle of light.  If they bomb us, middle of light, yeah.  Drop a bomb on me.  If they bomb us first. 
[03:52:30]  But the thing is, the United States is the most powerful country in the world.  You got that?  Think about it.  All right.  It's bigger than the Roman Empire.  If you go back to history, it's bigger than that.  Rome took over a lot of territory.  But America is the biggest. 
[03:53:00]  The baddest, biggest.  And freedom.  And you got everything to go with it.  All right, Tom.  That's a good point.  Let's go to the phones.  Peter from Massachusetts.  You got a question for Blue and Tom on Homeless Radio.  Hey, guys.  I have a question.  It's actually two parts.  Number one, do you think we're going to have a bad hurricane season?  And do you think a hurricane will hit New York City? 
[03:53:30]  You talking about a hurricane?  Tom, go first on this one.  What do you think about it?  Well, a hurricane?  Yeah, right over here.  Well, I really feel sorry about that.  I have no control over the weather.  And the thing is, if you had a hurricane, that's nature.  And so you pray to God to please pray to God.  All right?  Believe in God.  That's what I do.  The thing is, if a hurricane come over and blew your house over, 
[03:54:00]  I have no control over that.  I'm not all that powerful.  I wish I could.  I would stop it.  But a hurricane is a hurricane, and you got to deal with it.  But, my friend, where you live at?  This Big Blue talking.  I'm Big Blue.  I'm from Jersey.  He's from Massachusetts, Blue. 
[03:54:30]  What do you think about the hurricane season coming up?  You think it's a new bad one?  Massachusetts.  I've been there.  I've passed through.  I think it'll pass through.  But just like what Tippy Tom was saying,  Tippy Tom, no.  And pray to God.  Of course I do.  All right.  Does that answer your question, Peter?  Yes.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Yes.  Tippy Tom, believe in God.  All right.  Dan from Rhode Island, you got a question for Tippy Tom and Blue? 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, I got a question for old Golden Buns.  Hey, Tom, what do you think about global warming?  Golden Buns.  What do you think about the global warming issue, and how should we solve it?  Well, I believe in heat.  I like warm.  So, global warming is good.  Yeah, if you sleep outside.  Blue, your thoughts, global warming? 
[03:55:30]  I'm going warm.  Yeah.  I want more heat.  I get cold.  Fucking bums.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Thanks.  Who called me a bum?  Uh, Jeff.  Who called me a bum?  Jeff from New York, go ahead and ask your question.  Jeff called me a bum?  Are you telling that son of a bitch?  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Try again, Jeff.  Try to get in on that.  I'll tell his grandmother that he called me a bum. 
[03:56:00]  I know his connections.  I swear to God, I'll have him in trouble.  That's right.  All right.  Hold on, Tom.  Jeff.  He won't go to lunch with me.  All right.  Tom.  Go ahead, buddy.  How would you solve the homeless problem if you were president of the United States?  That's a good question.  You talking tippy-tom or blue?  Uh, Tom.  Tippy-tom.  No, the homeless problem, what I would do is take all that taxpayers' money and I'd build 
[03:56:30]  more fucking housing so these people have to live outside, okay?  In the ring.  I'm a homeless man, and it's not that expensive.  They spend billions of dollars on military weapons.  Why can't they spend a billion dollars?  For the homeless.  A billion? 
[03:57:00]  Yes.  Thank you.  Get rid of the military.  All right.  We need a strong military.  I'm all for that.  But the thing is this, is that we got people that need a place to live, and not that much.  And all they want is a, you know, a place to sleep, and a comfortable, safe place.  And we want no people to, um, like, purple.  And it's not that much.  And we got abandoned, excuse me, we got abandoned buildings in New York that can, you know, so people 
[03:57:30]  don't have to be like that.  So they have a home.  So build more homes.  In New York, we have plenty of space.  The thing is this, yeah.  Of course.  I'm a homeless man.  Myself.  I know homeless people all over New York. 
[03:58:00]  Manhattan, Brooklyn, and all over.  Queens.  You got the shirt on, Brooklyn.  I'm from Brooklyn.  I'm tippy-toe.  This big blue.  Well, I go to, I go to Brooklyn.  The thing is that I think we need to, um, um, you know, it's not much money to, to help  people.  All right.  Let's move on to another subject.  Don't you want to be comfortable? 
[03:58:30]  Yes.  Don't you want to feel comfortable?  All right, Tom.  And have a place to live.  Point taken.  Point taken.  All right, let's get to another caller.  Allison from Pennsylvania.  Go ahead.  You got a question for Tippy Tom and Blue on Homeless Radio.  Yeah.  Hey, guys.  I wanted to find out what their opinion was on the Iranian leader possibly going to the  World Cup.  Well, go ahead.  Well, go ahead.  Speak on your...  What, what, what, what, what, what?  You might answer...  Well, if you need... 
[03:59:00]  I didn't get that right.  If you need any help...  Speak slower.  Oh, God.  Stop trickling down his beard.  The...  I think the question is because the Iranian president has made some comments that the  Holocaust never existed.  Should he be able to go to Germany and see the World Cup where it's actually illegal to  make such comments?  Okay.  Burp.  Nothing.  Are you out of your mind?  Hold on.  Thanks, Allison.  How am I going to answer that question? 
[03:59:30]  You got to explain it differently.  And sorry, I'm a little slow.  It's no problem.  What about the World Cup in general?  You like soccer?  Excited?  Oh!  My cousin is a good soccer player.  Yeah.  Of course.  I don't know who's up.  I ain't kept up with it.  But if you were to have a favorite team, who do you think it would be?  The soccer teams?  Favorite World Cup team. 
[04:00:00]  Well, so many of them.  You got me saying, I'm not a real soccer player.  I'm more baseball.  What about the U.S. team?  You like them?  Yankees, right?  Not either.  All right.  Let's hit another controversial.  Yankees ain't baseball.  You're totally right.  Let's hit another topic here.  Jim from Arizona. 
[04:00:30]  Come on.  Give me something.  Give Tom and Blue something to talk about.  All right.  Go ahead, Jim.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  Hey, Tiffy Tom.  I'll keep it easy on you.  What do you feel about gay marriage and the president on that?  The president who?  What do you think about gay marriage, Tom?  Should it be allowed?  Who?  Do you think men should be able to marry other men legally?  Yes.  I'm all for it. 
[04:01:00]  If you fall in love with somebody, that's fair with me.  I don't care.  It's your business.  If you fall in love with a man, go right ahead.  If you fall in love with a woman, two women, it's okay with two women?  All right.  Well, two men.  If you fall in love with somebody, why not? 
[04:01:30]  All right.  Blue, you kind of laughed there.  What do you think about men marrying other men?  Well, I'm going to tell you like this.  This is Big Blue.  I'm a heterosexual and bisexual.  All right.  Just like what Tiffy Tom said, if you have a lover, you fall in love with him, go with it.  It doesn't matter what gender.  Gender.  All right.  That's beautiful.  All right.  My buddy Blue.  You guys are friends. 
[04:02:00]  Let's go.  Well, Tiffy Tom ain't my lover, okay?  No, that's fine.  I wasn't insinuating that.  Got a technology question from Jasper in Massachusetts.  Go ahead with your question, buddy.  Jasper, go ahead.  Hey, man.  Hey, great show.  Hey, listen.  I'm upgrading my home stereo.  I mean, my home theater.  And I don't know if I should go Blu-ray or HD DVD.  All right.  I'll try to pass that on to him. 
[04:02:30]  You guys have any thoughts on the new DVD formats coming out?  What DVDs?  What the fuck are they?  They play movies on them.  Can I jerk off?  I mean, if I can't jerk ass, jerk off, what the fuck I want that goddamn thing for?  Oh, I like to beat my meat when I'm fucking driving.  I do the right thing. 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, you can say whatever you want.  Satellite Radio.  All right.  You're a radio show?  All right.  Don't tell them who I am.  Okay.  My name is Blu.  I'm going to fuck you up.  All right.  Now, wait a second now.  What the fuck?  What the question was about?  I don't remember.  We're going to move on to Brian from Dallas. 
[04:03:30]  Brian.  Dallas.  Tick.  Brian, you got a question for Tippi Tom and Blue?  Go ahead.  From Dallas?  Guys, I wanted to ask you what you think about this section of the immigration bill that says  we have to ask Mexico if we can build a wall along the border.  We've got to get their permission.  I think that's wrong.  Personally, no wall.  I'm tired of the wall.  We pulled out a wall in Germany and break up Germany. 
[04:04:00]  And, no, we don't need no more walls.  That's all I have to say.  Let it go.  All right.  Blue, your thoughts?  How do we solve the immigration problem?  I don't know.  I'm not in Dallas.  I'm not all right there.  I'm in New York.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  I be trying to take care of New York.  All right.  You're a very immediate person.  All right.  Well, some other stuff we got going on in the news. 
[04:04:30]  The Kentucky Fried Chicken is getting sued for being too fat.  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, why, why?  We can't see getting sued for what?  For what?  People are saying there's too much trans fat in their foods.  And that kills too many people with the fat in the foods.  Well, we got to put some less than a shortening in it, though, isn't it? 
[04:05:00]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  He said put too much cat in the chicken?  Too much fat, Tom.  Too much cat?  That should bring me up then.  I'm just thinking this.  I'm eating cat?  Tom?  Well, I'm thinking I'm eating chicken?  Yeah, but he's my brother.  Who do you think is responsible, though?  The consumer or the company for selling, you know, the dangerous product? 
[04:05:30]  The consumer.  All right.  Tom?  No.  Do you think the company should stop selling fat chicken or people should stop buying fat chicken?  What do you think?  The company should stop fucking selling cat chicken, and I'm sick of it.  All right.  Tom, no one ever said you didn't commit to a bit.  I'm eating it.  No more cat chicken.  I am sick of it.  I want something different. 
[04:06:00]  Put some turkey in that chicken.  And no more cat in the chicken.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I want to hear that.  Your people are telling us we've got to wrap this up.  So we've got one more topic.  The recent death of Al-Zarqawi.  Did you hear about that?  No.  The head, one of the head terrorists in Iraq got killed. 
[04:06:30]  The U.S. bombed him and killed him.  What do you think about that?  What did he do wrong, number one?  He beheaded some people.  He killed people.  Yeah.  Cut off their heads and also...  What's the U.S. doing over there?  Bombing him.  Why?  We're going to go around in circles, aren't we?  Why?  Because he was a bad person that was blowing up Americans and other people.  He was doing that?  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  All right.  I don't know this.  If he was doing that, he got to get his ass beat.  The thing is this.  I don't know.  That's true to be told.  Okay.  No.  Now, are you sure about this?  It's pretty well documented.  So, this guy was bombing who?  Us.  Civilians.  Americans.  I heard all bombings here in America?  No.  They were in Iraq because we have got troops over there. 
[04:07:30]  He would attack them.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  All right.  So, in other words, they were bombing people, American troops.  What are Americans doing in Iraq in the first place?  To get the fuck out of there and come home.  All right.  Blue?  All right.  Yes.  Your thoughts?  My thoughts?  I mean, on the terrorism, all that bombing, all that.  On my mama grave.  God bless you, mama. 
[04:08:00]  Let's kill it, man.  Let's kill it there.  All right.  And for your final thoughts, we're going to wrap up the show.  Tom, how would you, what do you need to say before we sign off?  Well, I just want to say I love you and be well.  Look at all your guys.  So, what was that, Tom?  Sorry, Blue was talking.  I just say I love you and be well.  Be well.  And I'll hold you if you need me.  And just.  I got to go now.  Wait, wait.  Not yet, Blue. 
[04:08:30]  Just, just be you and be the best you you can be and be strong and don't take no shit  from nobody and blah.  That's what I say.  All right.  Not blah, but I love you.  Okay?  How's that?  That's awesome.  Blue.  Yes.  Final thoughts.  Final thoughts.  About what?  We're wrapping up the show.  What do you want to say to America before we finish?
