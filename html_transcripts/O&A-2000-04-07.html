<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with the hosts gleefully anticipating a day of unrestrained antics due to their bosses' absence.  They announced that Jay Moore and Kevin Pollack were scheduled as guests, and that the show would feature oil wrestling.  Spaz's Week in Review followed, a chaotic segment filled with his nonsensical commentary on various news items including "Raft Boy," a Ugandan mass suicide, Suzanne Somers (mistakenly conflated with another individual), Reverend Al Sharpton, and Giuliani's discovery of unused pipes. Spaz also expounded on a bizarre theory about replacing fire hydrants with "fire holes," incorrectly linking fiber optic cables to fire, and shared his opinion on the Supremes' reunion (believing their audience was deceased), Kevin Spacey's sexuality ("gay face"), a Kobe Bryant/Chris Childs fight, and the negative impact of Mexico's adoption of daylight savings time on Mexican marital relations.  He also recounted being urinated on from a high-rise.  Listeners called in, reacting with varying degrees of amusement and disbelief.  The hosts also discussed giving away Korn concert tickets, proposing listener challenges to win them. Anthony recounted a bizarre No Doubt concert experience involving a naked drummer and underwear-throwing audience members.

Comedian Kevin Pollack joined the show in studio.  Discussions ranged from Pollack's career and impressions (particularly Christopher Walken and William Shatner) to reactions to Spaz's earlier pronouncements. Pollack shared anecdotes from writing a book with William Shatner, including Shatner's explanation for his perceived overacting in *T.J. Hooker* (forgetting his lines).  They discussed Pollack's upcoming stand-up shows, his marriage and common-law marriage experiences, a past physical altercation, common-law marriage laws, and a previous "egg-shooting" radio bit that caused them trouble.  Listeners continued to call, some offering Christopher Walken impressions, others sharing their own bizarre experiences, including one caller, Jay, recounting a failed romantic encounter.  Spaz announced that a shirt, allegedly lost during a fight, was being auctioned. The planned oil wrestling segment was partially hampered by the absence of one participant.  A call went out for a volunteer to wrestle the available woman, with comedy tickets offered as an incentive.

The show's latter half featured an interview with Velvet, a pornographic actress, in studio.  The conversation quickly turned explicit, covering her work, physical attributes, and various sexual acts, including anal sex and double penetration.  Numerous callers joined the conversation, contributing their own vulgar commentary.  The discussion involved increasingly explicit conversations and interactions between the hosts, Velvet, and other guests, including Jay Moore.  An anecdote about "grower vs. shower" penises was mentioned.  The segment was punctuated by vulgar jokes and sexual innuendo.

A recurring character, Earl, described as a "gay virgin," was introduced, along with Velvet.  The hosts' attempts to encourage sexual interaction between Earl and Velvet were met with Earl's reluctance and visible distress, leading to further ribbing and homophobic slurs.  Psycho Mark Rowan was mentioned, and audio from a fight involving Jay and a "fat guy" was played.  Discussions of Earl's sexuality, various sexual acts, and Velvet's pornography (69menow.net) dominated, interspersed with explicit comments and jokes.  The show concluded with an oil wrestling match between Velvet and Emma, a stripper from a gentlemen's club, filmed outside the studio and shown with Spaz Cam commentary, leading to further sexually suggestive remarks.  Listeners called in, reacting to the showâ€™s events.

A final segment focused on the aftermath of a burlesque performance by Velvet Elvis, who almost injured herself with a large sex toy.  The hosts discussed this graphically, auctioning off a blue tarp with proceeds going to Earl's sex change operation.  Emma, visibly uncomfortable, was interviewed.  The show included crude jokes, sexual innuendo, and discussions of adult entertainment.  Dustin Wrangler was mentioned, along with promotions for Kevin Poppins, Mike D. Nicola, and Mario Cantone.  Warped Tour tickets were given away, and Velvet Elvis's website and upcoming performances were promoted.  The segment ended with more crude jokes and banter, including commentary on Emma's physical attributes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I can't go one afternoon without spanking my junk.  Okay, terrific.  Opie, Anthony, 1027, WNEW.  It's Friday, Friday, Friday!  Ah, yes, it is Friday. It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:00:30]  What?  This rage is so loud in my headphones.  I know, I can barely hear.  Sorry.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  You're going to need that as the show moves along here.  You should write that number down.  You never know when you're going to want to call.  Yes, of course.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  And we are ready to rock today.  Okay, my computer started. 
[00:01:00]  There we go.  Yes, the coffee is in action.  Almost done with the coffee.  We've got a real busy show today, Anthony.  Yeah.  I believe Jay Moore is stopping by before he goes back to L.A. tomorrow.  Oh, yeah?  Kevin Pollack is stopping by.  You think they'll fight?  Kevin Pollack and Jay Moore?  Yeah.  No, I don't think so.  We've got oil wrestling today to calm everyone the F down.  Wow, how did that happen?  How did we actually get that going?  I don't know. 
[00:01:30]  I'm amazed sometimes at what we can get moving on this show.  The bosses are gone, too.  Yeah, no, they just said, take it easy.  That's not good.  That's good when the bosses commute to faraway lands.  They go to another state.  No, no, no.  How I feel when the bosses leave, like, sometimes they leave on Thursday, sometimes they leave  on Friday.  Yeah.  It just reminds me of being in, like, ninth, tenth grade, and my parents going, okay, so  we're leaving for a week.  Yeah.  Take care.  You know, you've been thinking about them leaving for forever, knowing what debauchery 
[00:02:00]  you're going to get into as soon as they pull the car out of the driveway.  I know.  And it finally happens, and like, okay, so we're gone.  We'll see you next week sometime.  That's how I'm feeling right now.  It's like, okay, what do we do first?  What do we do first?  Do we order the keg?  Do we, you know, call all our pals?  Yeah, because I think we could take the drinking memo and throw it away.  After the coffee.  So they're already, it's funny, Jeremy left ten minutes ago.  They're already setting up the blue tarp outside the studio for the oil wrestling. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  Nice.  Hopefully we will be out of trouble.  Yeah, Joel.  Joel, just don't break the big crystal egg.  Right.  Joel.  Let's try not to do that.  Sometimes you have to say, what the F?  Right.  Every day.  It's going to be fun.  And, of course, right around the corner, Anthony.  Yeah.  Spaz's, do we have his, like, song and stuff?  Where's his jingle?  Where's his jingle and that other thing from last week? 
[00:03:00]  We got Spaz's Week in Review.  Did you give it a little listen, a little preview?  Did you catch any of it?  The Spaz Week in Review?  Yeah.  Yeah, I checked it out a little bit.  Is it good?  Funny?  All right.  Entertaining?  Classic Spaz?  I believe you're going to be quite entertained today.  After you left the office last night, Spaz comes in to talk to Jeremy, who was in our office.  Spaz, I've got to get to Spaz Week in Review on tape, but Earl is in one of the studios, and  the second block studio is being used by Jim, and I've really got to get this done. 
[00:03:30]  So, me, you know, I never speak up.  I don't care about anything that goes on in this place.  But I turned around at that point and went, Jeremy, this is top priority.  Spaz has to get into a studio to do this.  I never speak up like that.  No.  Well, I just had to use my executive power.  That's brilliant.  You get Earl out of the studio.  Whatever you've got to do, Spaz has to get in there.  Well, let me see.  I did take a quick listen, because I didn't want it to get boring like last week, because 
[00:04:00]  I felt like the Spaz Week in Review started off strong and then just came to a screeching  halt.  So, I had to cut out some of the boring stuff.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of all the stuff like you heard last week that made it bad, like some  of the sports crap and all that.  But he does have some good commentary on Raft Boy.  Raft Boy?  Ugandans.  Well, everybody, I'm obviously curious if he has any comments on people urinating off the  rooftops.  Well, I almost cut the story out.  Really?  Because we did an awful lot on the urinating off the top of buildings. 
[00:04:30]  But no, I kept that in there, Anthony.  Okay.  He has some commentary about Suzanne Somers.  What the hell has Suzanne Somers done of late?  Well, he's a little confused.  Oh, no.  He thinks Suzanne Somers is someone else.  That's all I'll say.  Oh, no.  Oh, good classic, Spaz.  I love it already.  He talks about the mass suicide in Uganda.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Mexicans.  He has a problem with Mexicans.  Always.  This week.  I don't know what it is with Mexican.  Let me see.  Oh, and something about pipes.  Pipes.  Under the ground that can help firefighters better.  Pipes.  Yeah.  Oh, right?  Spaz on pipes.  They're eons away.  I guess Giuliani found some pipes.  Yeah.  Is what I was getting from this little clip.  Good, good.  I can't wait to hear it.  And then he also has some commentary on Reverend Al.  Mm-hmm.  And I think that's about it. 
[00:05:30]  All right.  So we're going to start that very, very soon, right around 3 o'clock.  Yeah.  So get your friends around the radio.  Can't wait.  Get your coffee or beers or your bong.  Your heroin, if you're going to be listening to Spaz.  Here's the Week in Review thing.  Dude, politics and stuff.  He's as dumb as a boxer rock.  His lips are jacking when he tries to talk.  This is it.  The Week in Review.  It's fast.  You dumb. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  His own little jingle.  But before we get into that.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  Oh.  Too many to count.  Are very curious.  They need a concert review from last night from our pal Anthony.  Yeah.  Opie, this was one of their encore songs.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Last night at Roseland.  Of course, I was there at the No Doubt show.  I think I had more pubes on me than in the entire place.  I would have won the most pubes contest.  So do you have a review from the No Doubt show, Anthony? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, you know, if you like No Doubt, it was a great show.  And personally, I don't think she looks as hot as she used to.  Uh-huh.  I think she's taking that Debbie Harry route.  And in a few years, you're not even going to recognize her.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Gavin's doing something to her.  I think he's sucking her dry of any youth she has left.  I don't like the pink hair.  I was up on the balcony looking down on the prepubescent crowd. 
[00:07:30]  They all got pink hair.  Looked like an Easter egg hunt down on the floor.  Oh, I don't know.  No Easter egg hunt, I said.  I got you.  I know.  Somebody's giving me strange looks.  Okay.  Yeah, it's kind of odd.  Being in Roseland, a place where I actually saw many concerts.  We had broadcast live there.  My God, I saw on one bill the Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins at Roseland once.  Years ago.  And there I am, drinking hand, walking around, bumping into moms, carting around their nine-year-old 
[00:08:00]  daughters that are wearing their PJs so they can go right to bed when they get home.  And you're spilling beer all over them.  Oh, it was a kid-toucher's dream there last night.  You had your belly shirt on.  Yeah, yeah.  I had my belly shirt on so you had my belly ring.  Yeah.  Yeah, I dyed my hair pink.  And you're hallucinating.  Yeah, so, you know, I went there, hung out. 
[00:08:30]  I want to say hi to everybody I met there last night.  A couple of fans there to lambast me.  Yeah, it's a school day, so they're not home yet.  A lot of young ladies there.  Yeah.  A lot of, you know, kids struggling with that puberty thing.  We were on there last night, yeah.  I didn't know your girlfriend was bringing her friends. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, that's real funny, Opie.  That's real funny.  Very humorous.  Come on.  Yeah, so few people.  Said hi.  Few people I can't talk about on this radio show.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Said hi.  It was, uh, it was very, uh... 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  It was very...  There was no doubt when I got that.  The crowd just sounded like...  It was like, uh, when somebody won the snake can game on Wonderama.  The same sound.  It was kind of high-pitched.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Cute response from the crowd on this one.  The lighters came out.  Oh, yeah.  The hands.  The little hands waving back and forth. 
[00:10:00]  The little hands waving back and forth.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on, you had to be laughing when this song started out.  The little stick legs coming out of the shorts with the knobby knees.  The little buds.  Put it this way.  I'd have bet any amount of money playing Guess What's in My Pants with any of the girls that were there last night.  Wood floor. 
[00:10:30]  Wood floor.  I'm watching me.  I want me.  No, it's supposed to be fair.  Right.  Oh, please don't get there.  There I was, waving my arms back and forth.  Yeah, don't touch.  Don't touch.  Don't touch.  Let me go to Mark.  Hey, Mark, what's up?  Hey, man, I think I saw Anthony throw panties on the stage for the naked drummer. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, that was a weird thing.  Somebody, the drummer, from No Doubt, is like naked.  He's just wearing a thong underwear.  And he's in front of girls that are, I swear to God, nine years old.  Nine, ten, twelve, fourteen.  He gets out and then somebody threw panties on the stage.  He takes his thong panties off.  So now he's completely naked on stage.  Get out of here.  In front of...  Dude, I swear to God, ask this guy, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, completely naked in front of a prepubescent crowd. 
[00:11:30]  And then he puts the other pair of undies on and goes back behind the drums.  It was really weird.  He came right out in front of the drum set, right to the front of the stage, and was just  stark naked.  And Gwen's saying, oh, those are my panties that you threw out into the audience.  You know, um...  With the woman stain in them, too.  With the period stain.  Yeah.  In them.  And it's like, kids don't even know what you're talking about, period.  They've got a couple of years left.  Where was your girlfriend during the show, Anthony?  I think I saw you.  You were on the stage with some other guy in a big leather jacket, right?  On stage?  No, no.  There was a stage on the right side of the balcony area. 
[00:12:00]  You were saying it was some guy with, like, real long hair?  No, I wasn't on that side.  Oh, that wasn't you.  Okay.  That's the other radio there.  I thought it was...  So I'm glad you didn't go scream, okay, terrific at the guy.  No, I was on the other side balcony.  Where I could, uh, see the fan.  Yeah.  Well, thank you, Mark.  No problem.  Take care, guys.  Yeah, that was kind of weird.  Took his clothes off in front of the kids.  Lacey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey. 
[00:12:30]  Hey.  Okay, you're on the air.  Hi.  Um, I was at the show last night.  I didn't see you, though.  I was looking totally everywhere, but...  Aw.  You weren't tall enough.  I definitely wasn't.  Couldn't see above everyone's head.  You're so tiny and small.  Um, I'm not that...  Well, I'm tiny, but I'm definitely older.  Just look for the guy that could have been any of those girls' dad.  Yeah, I was.  I was looking for the old guy in the crowd, but, you know.  Gee. 
[00:13:00]  I didn't see you.  How old are you, Lacey?  21.  Oh.  Yeah, I was one of the old folks there.  Yeah.  Lacey.  Um, I just wanted to tell you that you were wrong about the encore.  Why?  They didn't do don't speak.  I mean, um, they didn't do just a girl for the encore.  Uh-huh.  They did, um, I don't know.  Oh, what the...  What the hell do I know?  Like I was paying attention.  Well, I just wanted to call you out on that one.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you, Lacey.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Steve real fast before we get to Spaz's Week in Review. 
[00:13:30]  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's up with your mom taking you and your dad up in the station wagon after the show?  Yeah, that was kind of funny.  It was like a bunch of parents there.  You think that's bad?  I went to Agnostic Front in New Jersey last weekend.  Yeah.  And it was a non-alcoholic show.  There were kids there that must have been like 10, 9 years old doing nothing.  You couldn't even smoke in the building.  Yeah, well, this was weird because there were people just drinking, boozing it up.  And you turned around. 
[00:14:00]  You're lucky you had that.  There's a kid right there in front of you.  We had people.  What do you call it?  Balls, you know, little headbangers running around.  You couldn't smoke, couldn't drink, nothing.  We were the two longest-hand people in the place, me and my buddy.  I think I saw a couple of 14-year-old girls lose their virginity on top of the crowd last night in the pit.  Did you go surfing?  Yeah, surfing.  All right, Steve, thank you.  All right, take care, man.  But after the show, the station wagons were pulling up. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, the parents taking their kids by the hand and walking them out and, you know, how was the show?  And then there's just these kids on, you can tell they're on X, a couple of them, up in the balcony.  This one guy's, like, dancing around with his arms flailing, totally, like, X'd out of his gourd.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, thank you for the review of the No Doubt Show.  Oh, no problem, O.  Gate toucher.  No problem. 
[00:15:00]  All right, I think we're ready for Spaz's Week in Review.  Oh, good.  Take the heat off of Anne.  Yeah, we're going to...  You took it well, though, Anthony.  Well, you know, what am I going to do?  I went.  I went to the concert.  We're going to take a quick break.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, I think we're going to dedicate, uh, this song to Anthony.  Oh, good, good.  It ain't over yet, huh?  Good.  Well, I only have two more minutes left.  A little ditty.  All right.  Each time I see a little girl here at eight or nine or ten, 
[00:15:30]  I can't resist years to stick my tongue inside of them because I'm horny.  For little girls, for little girls, have hairless little twos.  I'm horny for little girls.  I get them hot as unalcohol and pot. 
[00:16:00]  That little butt surrounds the tight and shiny.  It makes you want to stash your junk inside her house.  I'm horny for little girls.  I want to bang them all, sometimes as young as one or two.  And then I kill them when I am.  Oh, I'm horny for little girls. 
[00:16:30]  I tape their mouths and tie them to the wall.  Oh, I'm horny for little girls.  Oh, I bite them and I make them lick my bones.  The little nips so helpless and appealing.  I want to slice them off and mount them on the ceiling.  I'm honey for little girls 
[00:17:00]  I'm honey for them all  No matter where, no matter who  Without them, my old b**** would be blue  I'm honey  I'm so honey  I'm honey for little girls  Come sit on my lap, little girl

Mm-hmm  Where they lock the  Lock the parents in the basement  House arrest  House arrest  Thank you  Thank you  House arrest  Is Big Kev setting up the Blue Tarp?  Yes  The Blue Tarp Cabaret, Anthony  Yeah  I didn't think we'd be able to bring  The Blue Tarp Cabaret to New York  But it has finally arrived  It was stuck in storage in Boston  For three years 
[00:28:00]  It's the Blue Tarp Cabaret  Yeah, we love it  Oil wrestling on the Blue Tarp Cabaret today  All right  Okay, let's get into the  Spaz's weekend review  Oh, boy  How you doing, Spaz?  Very good  You notice how we're stalling?  Because we just don't want to go through this process again  This kills me  I cut it down  I should have taken a whiz  I cut it down as best as I can  Beforehand  Because I know during the middle of it  I'm just going to wet myself  All right  There we go, Anthony  All right 
[00:28:30]  Spaz's weekend review  This is the weekend review  With yours truly, K-Dog  And let's just get  Dipped right into it  Let's just begin with  Raft Boy  Last week I gave my views  On the immigrants coming to America  And this time  More immigrants are coming to America  But this time by plane  It seems that the American Congress  Is now allowing these people to come by plane  Instead of trying to tough it out by boat  What?  The American Congress has allowed the Cubans to come by plane 
[00:29:00]  Instead of by toughing it out by boat  Yes  So you think it's up to the American Congress  Whether or not these people are allowed to get into our country?  Yes, because they can veto anything that the President puts forth  Oh, my God  So are you talking about the one plane load  That came over with the parents and everything?  Yes, but now this could start a trend  Where we allow all these other immigrants to come by plane  We invite them in  Don't you think Fidel Castro has something to do with this, too? 
[00:29:30]  I would think so  The American Congress  The Easter Bunny ought to be held responsible  All right  The American Congress is at fault here  The American Congress  Letting claim loads of Cubans in  You know  I've got to hear that again  I'm sorry  The American Congress, Anthony  It sounds like a farmer  More immigrants are coming to America  But this time by plane 
[00:30:00]  It seems that the American Congress  Is now allowing these people to come by plane  Instead of trying to tough it out by boat  And it's like  Instead of keeping these people out  Now we're like inviting them in  Anyway  Raff Boy's dad is coming to America  To pick up his son  Bring him back to Cuba  But everybody knows he's not going back  He's just going to be another one of these  Cheap-ass immigrants  That's going to stay in America  Ruin the country  And just be a total disturbance to us 
[00:30:30]  Anyway  He's asking the United States  To grant him 22 more visas  Like we need 22 more Cubans in America  We have enough of you people here  Yeah  And there's a nice little picture here  Of Elian Gonzalez  Pointing a little toy gun  I guess that's his future in America  Oh my god  Except for it's not going to be a toy gun  Wow  Are you saying that Cubans  Usually end up to be criminals  Toting guns 
[00:31:00]  Well they have that look about them  They have that look about them  Don't know what it is  And what is that look?  It's like the  I'm always pissed off  Oh my god  What do you mean the skinhead look?  I've never seen one of them smile  Cubans don't smile  Carry guns  And they have that pissed off look  And they have that pissed off look  No matter what 
[00:31:30]  And pretty much every Cuban then  Is a criminal  Is what you're assuming  At this point Spaz  There are a lot of them in the jail system  Now have you heard that  There's going to be a protest  That they're going to blockade  The roads to Miami airport  So that they can't get the kid out  How about that one?  The Cubans protesting  Protesting  Well I guess it gives them an excuse  To mow them down  Alright let's move on  More commentary on Raft Boy 
[00:32:00]  Right?  Wow  There we go  Anyway so that's just going on  With Raft Boy  Oh that wasn't too painful  And we got through  The first story  Oh my god  This commentary on Raft Boy  Holy Jesus  And here we go  Let's move on with Spaz Radio  He's the biggest dumbass in town  Whoa  Spaz Radio  Whoa  Anyway  What else is going on?  In Uganda we have a mass suicide  And one of the cultists 
[00:32:30]  Left to get a meal  Because apparently  Suzanne Somers  Or whatever her name is  The Archie Bunker girl  Didn't get enough money  Suzanne Somers  Suzanne Somers  The Archie Bunker girl  Aha  Suzanne Somers  Suzanne Somers  Yes  Same girl that does the Thighmaster 
[00:33:00]  Yes  Is the same girl on TV  Begging for money  I keep getting their names confused  I thought it was Suzanne Somers  Suzanne Somers  That would be  Sally Struthers  Oh  Sally Struthers  Suzanne Somers  Very easy to mix that up  Why  But they stand together  They look like the number 10  Sally Struthers  Big fat woman  Alright  Suzanne Somers  Very slender  Here we go  To feed all those Africans 
[00:33:30]  So  He went out for a little meal  Whatever to eat there  Probably bugs, flies  Because they have nothing to eat in Africa  Because they're Africans  Maybe bananas or something  But  Yeah  He went out for a little meal  And  He survived the cult because of that  He didn't kill himself  Because he actually wanted to nourish himself  And if all the money that I donate  To  To the cause of  Feeding the Africans  Who  Who are there  Who don't be able to eat  And there's flies all around them all the time 
[00:34:00]  Then  You know  He should be able to  He should be nourished  But yet  All them Ugandans  And all those other Africans  Are like  Skin and bones  Because  All the money was sent  To that fat  Bitch  From Archie  Bunker and everything  It  It goes to waste  It goes to her  I mean  It's beating her fat ass  Anyway  So his last minute meal  Saved the cult  The teen  From cult doom  So  Anyway  So how much do you send 
[00:34:30]  To that big fat woman  What they say  Seventy four cents a day  You send that  From time to time  You have sent  Seventy four cents a day  Seventy four cents a day  To feed a starving African child  Once or twice  You are so full of crap  Just once or twice  Seventy four cents  It's not going to be  Yeah but you don't  Just send change in there  It's seventy four cents a day  But you have to sign up  For like  The kid's entire childhood  It amounts to a few hundred bucks  At least  I'll pay for his 
[00:35:00]  Easter meal  In return  You get to write letters  To each other  I'm sure the African kid  Would be like  Jesus Christ  I had to get the most  Stupidest guy in America  Writing me  I'm African  I've had no education  I'm starving  But these letters  Are more painful  Than the pain in my gut  From not eating  Yeah does he write  Little letters back  Thanking you  For the change  That was a few years ago  So I don't  That is stupid  You feed a little 
[00:35:30]  South American child  Or something  For seventy four cents a day  What did you do  Just put change  In an envelope  And mail it to  Mail it to  That fat  The little kid  Which flies around  In Africa  Now the first time  I did it  I did send change  But then my mother  Told me  No it would be better  Send check  So I sent the check  A check for seventy four cents  Yes  It doesn't work like that  You sign up 
[00:36:00]  Right  They assign you a child  Who probably  It isn't even  Exclusive to you  Like a bunch of people  Are signed on  To a village  Or children  And you pay them  Like five hundred bucks  Because on average  Seventy four cents a day  Feed them  But it's not just  Oh thank god  Spass sent this in  Dinner's on  You know  You get one meal  Out of it  You sent a check  For seventy four cents  To Africa  To feed a child  Because of Sally Strother 
[00:36:30]  Because of Sally Strother  Brilliant  Sally Strother's  Checking in Anthony  Yeah  I'll start taking up  A collection to have  Spass neutered  Yeah  That's a good idea  So the story goes  What  One of these guys  From Uganda  Yes  Decided to go out  For a meal  And he escaped  The doom of the cult  Ah  Escaped the doom  Of the cult  What did he go  To McDonald's  Or something  No they don't  Have those out there  Yeah where did  He go to eat  If they have no food  Or anything  I'm curious 
[00:37:00]  Well there's  There's nothing there  But flies  And they even drink  The same water  Do they pee in  Yeah  Okay  I got a new idea  For a TV show  Yeah  Spazzes say  The stupidest things  Cosby needs a new show  We got Spazz over here  Spazzes the stupidest things  Or the darndest things  Right  Yeah  Spazzes say  The darndest things  He's going to be talking  About geography today  He's going to be talking 
[00:37:30]  About Uganda  The child  With the flies  Around the head  Would rather have flies  Buzzing around his head  Than the sound  Of Spazzes' voice  Even if Spazzes  Did bring him a sandwich  For 74 cents  Some boys got a puddin' pot  For a brain  Spazzes say  The darndest things  So Uganda  Very good  Is that all we have 
[00:38:00]  On Uganda  We're moving on  To another story here  I assume  I believe so  Alright  He's the biggest  Dumbass in town  It's radio  Anyway  What's going on  Also with cell phones  A lot of people  Have cell phones  In America  Those who could  Afford them  And now they came up  With this new technology  Where there's a hand  Free cell phone  Where you just stick  The little piece  In your ear  And you'll be able  To talk  Through a little  Microphone  That's on the cord  That leads to the 
[00:38:30]  Cell phone  That you hold  In your hand  So it's like  Bigger technology  For Americans  So they don't have  To put the phone  To their ear  That way  I don't know  To me  I think  This is stupid  But yeah  Now they trigger  Radiation  I guess  As technology  Gets better  And we get  More and more  Into the computer age  That  Radiation occurs  I guess it's because  This is  Unraveled 
[00:39:00]  Untouched  Technology  That  People are just  Now getting into  And I guess  The stuff to make it  It's getting cheaper  And cheaper  Because you gotta  Afford cell phones  Nowadays  Because you get  Cheaper and cheaper  You get sloppier  And I guess  The waves  The telephone waves  That come from  The receivers  That are emitting  Radiation  And it could affect  You know  People's brain cells  And such  So I would say  Stick to the  Cell phone you've been with  Just might 
[00:39:30]  You have to recharge  The battery  And I say  Don't go for  The better technology  Because sometimes  It's just not  You know  Working  There's a bad  Moment of  You know  What  He won  Whoa  Stupid  Stupid  Stupid  A whole break  On cell phones  And  Boy I really  Wasn't getting  A lot of that  What's with  The radiation  There was an article  In the paper  Yeah  About how 
[00:40:00]  Newer cell phones  Are emitting  Radiation waves  Radiation waves  Yes  Can you surf  On these  Radiation waves  No  Well they're  They're radio waves  Yes  You know  Radio waves  Radiate  Yes  But it's affecting  People's brain cells  It's affecting  Wow  You have a cell phone  Yeah  How many do you have  Do you strap them  To your head  With duct tape  At night  And just  Turn them on  High or something  Do you live near 
[00:40:30]  Cancer's live wires  This pushes re-dial  Yeah  You just keep  Pushing dial  So  So the newer phones  Yes  Have more radiation  Yes  The phones that  You could  They stick the piece  In their ear  And on the cord  Going down to your phone  Is a little microphone  Yeah  I've seen that  Sure  Yes  And because of  That new technology  Because it's getting  Cheaper to make cell phones  To make it more  Valuable to the customer  Then it's being  Made cheaper  And thus emitting  These radiation waves 
[00:41:00]  So stick to your  Old cell phones  Yes  Because they're more  Good  Radiant free  They're more good  And now spaz  For Nokia  Hi  Nokia's more good  Go get me  A box of donuts  Because they're more good  Your old phones  Are more good  Alright great  Brett from Comac  Checking in  Yeah  Hey ONA  What's up  I need to know  What I've ever done

[00:42:30]  Same old  BS  Of no justice  No peace  Give me your money  And I'll  Get on the camera  Buy a new suit  And  Do my thing  So yeah  He's back  In the news again  Leading more rallies  All throughout this week  Causing nothing but trouble  Apparently he's not happy  With the Amadou Diallo case  As well as the other  Police shooting  Of Desdemone  Who was an unarmed  Black guy  Who supposedly  Was buying 
[00:43:00]  Drugs  Supposedly  Supposedly  So yeah  He's back in the news  Causing some ruckus  Saying yeah  I'm going to get arrested  For the good of the people  Meanwhile he's  Using everybody else's money  From his community  Quote unquote  The bell is  Fat ass out  So  Anyway  This fat ass  Is back in the news again  No justice  No peace  I'm going to do Diallo  And  I really don't think  He  I really don't think  He's going to get  Much luck with it 
[00:43:30]  Nobody listens  To  To big mouths  Anymore  Who just  Go around  Causing trouble  And stuff  Anyway  City Hall  Oh my god  Alright listen  Miguel from Jersey  Spaz makes  Old Mind Fuhrer  And the KKK song  Seem like  Backstreet Boys songs  Just put music  In the background  You have a winner  So you don't think  Reverend Al  Has any supporters  Whatsoever at this point  Huh  He does have a few  Just a few 
[00:44:00]  Just a few  Yeah  Otherwise it wouldn't  Be called a rally  But  What would it be called  If he didn't have  A few  I think it would be  Called a  March  So if it's more than  A few  It's a rally  If it's less than  A few  It's a march  Yes  Because rallies  Make noise  Marches are silent  You can't be real  You can't be real  Jack from Jersey

[00:50:00]  Anyway  City Hall  Going into City Hall now  Mr. Rudy Giuliani  Just found  Unused pipes  That's right  Unused pipes  That are underneath  The city  That probably have  Rotted away by now  But people are  Officials are saying  They are usable  That these things  Are  Could cause water  To be pressurized  What  Pressurized  So that firefighters 
[00:50:30]  Will have a better chance  Of combating a fire  Wait a minute  The pipes  He found these pipes  Yes  I guess Giuliani  Was just walking  Through the sewer system  One night  Hey  Look what I stumbled upon  He's just walking  Monk  Ow  Look at my big  Balooka whale forehead  Knocked into something  Get a flashlight on it  Hey  It's pipes  You know  I believe  These pipes  Could pressurize  Waters  To best  Help the firemen 
[00:51:00]  In our facility  Fight fires  Quick  Check with Spaz  To see if this is feasible  So  So the pipes  The pipe  They pressurize  The water  Yes  How do they do that  Spaz  I thought pipes  Transport water  I guess maybe  If they get smaller  Some type of  Venturi system 
[00:51:30]  In them  Maybe they can  Pressurize water  So  But let's go to Spaz  Sure  Spaz  Yes  How do these  Pipe  How do they  Pressurize water  I guess  Like the way  That they're  Contorted  So they're underground  Crazy straws  That was what you're saying  Right  They pop  They go round  In circles  And they pop up  Into a fire hydrant  They get  Stop  Oh my goodness 
[00:52:00]  Gracious  Thank God  For Spaz  For Spaz's crazy straw  Pipes  Oh my God  That place would have  Burnt down  Hundreds of lives  Would have been lost  If it wasn't for Spaz's  Crazy straw  Pressurizing pipes  That were found  Beneath the city  This is great Spaz  Thank you  You've got a commendation  Dean what's going on  Oh hey  What's up  Spaz's gotta stay 
[00:52:30]  Pressurizing pipes  Norton  That's what's under the city  Pressurizing pipes  Chalk them up  Yeah go ahead  Hey thanks a lot  For last week  What's Mary doing  Five years with my wife  Finally got back door  Oh because  Of the game we played  Last week  What is Jane doing  I'm sitting in the parking lot  With my wife  Weaned for a FedEx truck  All pissed off  That was  Listening to that skit  Yeah  Two hours later 
[00:53:00]  First time  Since I've been with her  Five and a half years  That was a great  Great phone call  Last Friday  Well she just called me  And told me  If I called in the show  And tell anything about it  She's going to make me  Do it again  During Spaz's review  Alright  Thank you  Dean  Alright guys  Bye  Syndication now  Yeah  Alright  Well that used to sound  Really exciting  But  Okay so  So there's these  Underground pipes  That pressurize the water  That Mayor Julian  And he found  During one of his  One of his  Nightly jaunts  Through the 
[00:53:30]  Sewer system  New York's underground  Alright  And he thinks  The firemen  Could use these  You gotta  Can make the jobs easier  Do we have that echo  Oh yeah  Let me  Do we have the echo  Yeah let me  Do a little of this  A little of that  Just want to hear  What that would sound like  Go ahead  Hello  Yeah  Hold on  Hold on  Somewhere  It's so hard to find  Yeah  I know  It should be there  People change things  Around all the time  There it is  There it is  Hello 
[00:54:00]  Hello  Let me just  Let me just  Walk around  Down here  Oh look  It's a mutant  Ninja turtle  Look at that  Deep down beneath  The streets  Of New York City  I keep tabs on  Above the streets  And below  As I walk around  I  Hey what's this  It looks like  A pipe  But it's  Lacky  It's shaped like  A crazy frog  I believe 
[00:54:30]  These pipes  Pressurize water  And if we  Feed them to  The fire hydrants  The firemen  Could put fires  Out  Better  At least that's  What the fire says  Oh no  Mr. Giuliani  I gotta correct you  Yes  Because you found  These pipes  We're not gonna need  Fire hydrants anymore  It's a little later  In the story  Oh really  Yeah  So let me  Well  Let me turn off  Your echo  We're not even 
[00:55:00]  Gonna need fire  Oh let it roll  Let it roll  All right  So Rudy G  Has found these pipes  Found these pipes  To help the firemen  Here we go  Instead of using  The fire hydrants  So maybe like  If these pipes  Can be used  Like through the  Grounds  You can stick  The hose  In the ground  Instead of  You can open up  Better parking spaces  I think  I think that  If we can use  Utilize  If we can utilize  Like  Get the essence  Of these pipes  And just use them  For the hoses 
[00:55:30]  For the fire hoses  Like  Get the essence  Of these pipes  What does that mean  Get the essence  Of these pipes  Spaz  Spaz  You can't get  The essence  Of the pipes  What is  Wait a minute  What is  A fire hydrant  It provides water  Yeah but it's  An end of a pipe  Yeah  Like the hose  That you put  In the pipe  In the ground  That's a fire hydrant  It's the adapter  From the pipe  To the hose  So how different  Would these 
[00:56:00]  Mysterious pipes  Be  To delivering water  To the fireman's  Hoses  Easy  You lead the pipes  Up to the surface  Of  It's easy  Of course it is  To the surface  Of the street  Right  You have just like  You know like  You have a pothole  Right next to you  You have a fire hole  And you  So it eliminates  The hindrance  Of a  Of a  Fire hydrant  Yeah those pesky  Fire hydrants  So how would it  Eliminate it  Then how would  They be kept  Clear of debris 
[00:56:30]  How would it be  Easily recognizable  By firemen  Driving down the street  That there's a fire  A hose  Pipe thing  Well and  The answer is obvious  Oh okay  All these pipes  Have essences  And if you eliminate  The essences  Of pipes  Yeah  Then I smell it  This theory  Obviously works  Yes  My god  There's a fire  Over there  And we don't know  Where the  The pipes are  I don't know  Wait I smell  The essence  Of a pipe  Of a crazy  Straw like  Highly pressurized 
[00:57:00]  Pipe  Amazing  Yeah it brings up  A very simple observation  If you're a fireman  Yes  And you're  Going to a fire  Usually you look  For the fire hydrant  And go  Oh that's where  I could get water  How are you going to  Find these holes  In the ground  That might be  Covered with garbage  Or something  Laid on top of it  A garbage pail  See the fire hydrant  Is very hard  For anything to be  On top of it  Because it's  Shaped like  A fire hydrant  See what 
[00:57:30]  Would be suggested  Is that  You know how  Like a sewer cap  Says sewer on it  Yeah  You would put  Like a little cap  Next to the sewer cap  That says  Fire hydrant  Fire hydrant  And they pop that cap  Off and  Sticks the hose in  Alright thank you  For that Spaz  The only people  That lose out  Are the little  Colors in Harlem  During the summer  During the summer  They don't have  The hydrants  To dance under  When it's very hot out  You see the way  They do that  They pop their caps  On the hydrants  So the color  We have problems 
[00:58:00]  And Spaz's brain  Check it in  Oh really  Finally  From Spaz's head  Help me  It's dark and lonely  In here  I had to back up  A little bit here  Just so we could  Get the essence  Of what Spaz  Is attempting  To state here  Pipes can be used  Like through the ground  You can stick the hose  In the ground  Instead of  And we can open up  Better parking spaces  I think  I think that  If we could use  Utilize  If we could utilize 
[00:58:30]  Like  Like  Get the essence  Of these pipes  And use them  For the hoses  For the fire hoses  Like stick them  In the ground  Get a little  You don't like  To have potholes  In the ground  But get these  Little fire hose  You know  Fire hose holes  In the ground  Instead of using  The fire hydrants  Then maybe open up  More parking spaces  It'll be better parking  Instead of getting  That'll be one less ticket  For policemen to write  And I think  This idea can work  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  Wait a minute  It's fast  Even if the hose 
[00:59:00]  Goes into the ground  Instead of a hydrant  You still can't  Park near it  The fire truck  Needs access  To the  Essence of the  Pipe hole  No  No see  Yeah  Yeah  The fire trucks  Need access  To the fire hole  Holy smoke  Can someone  Take a fire axe  To his head  Just because  There's no fire hydrants  The fire truck  Still has to get  To that location  See there's no parking  Near the fire hydrants  Not because it's a hydrant  But because  You can call it anything  Why don't we rename 
[00:59:30]  The hydrants  Signs  And that way  We can park them  Because you're allowed  To park in front of a sign  You just can't park  In front of a hydrant  So if we rename  The hydrants  Signs  Then we can park near them  And the police  Have to write one less ticket  See do you get our point  Like it's still  The trucks need access  To the fire hose holes  Once they find  The essence of  The crazy straw pipe  Yeah  Cut it out  But I have an explanation 
[01:00:00]  For that one too  Okay  Okay  See with a fire hydrant  You need a large space  For the hose to get through  So you bash  Someone's window in  To get through  We saw that  On backdraft  So you don't have to  Because now  Because it's in the ground  You could do it  Underneath the car  Or you don't have to  Leave such a big space  You could do it  In between two cars  And maneuver  The hose around  He's the biggest  Dumbass in town  Smash radio 
[01:00:30]  Stupid  You're so stupid  Okay terrific  Okay  Wow  I have never  In all my days  Could you imagine  If he ran the city  Could you imagine  This place would look like  Pee Wee's Playhouse  Could you imagine  If he ran the city  There'd be crazy straws  All over the place  Could you imagine  Giuliani  Stepping up to the podium  Ladies and gentlemen  I have an announcement  To make  We are doing away  With fire hydrants 
[01:01:00]  In lieu of fire holes  In the ground  Think of the savings  The cops won up  The right day  No no no  Fire hole holes  Fire hole holes  Fire hole holes  Okay Ed  Are we done with  We'll just call  The hydrants  Pedestrians  Are we done  With this story here  Or we have a little  More comments  I don't think  We're ever going to  Be truly done  With this story  This one's going to  Stick with me  Like a traumatic  Experience  Every time I see  A fire hydrant  Now it's going to 
[01:01:30]  It's going to be  In my head  You're going to go  You know  There should be  A fire hole  Why do we have  Fire hydrants  Kramer why  What's with these  Fire hydrants  Why not have  Fire holes  Fire hole holes  With crazy straws  Pressurized  Crazy straw pines  The essence of them  Why aren't you listening  Rantings of a madman  You're like  Charlie Manson  Spazes say  The darndest things  You hear Charles Manson 
[01:02:00]  Talk  And he starts  Talking about  Like you know  And the biggest  Thing about being  On the inside  Of prison  Is I'm not on  The inside  I'm on the inside  Because you people  On the inside  Being on the outside  Being on the  And he's just like  What  Okay  Here we go  And  I don't know  This is my opinion  That it can work  It can open up  Parking space  Stick the fire hose  In the ground  And use the  Pressurized pipes  This untapped resource  If you just  Fix them up  And they'll take off  The rest  Untapped resource  There's an untapped resource 
[01:02:30]  In your hand man  Why is it an untapped resource?  Because they were just discovered  It's like a natural thing  So who do you think  Put these pipes there?  The ancient Incas  Cut it out  Yeah who put these pipes  I don't even know  If I need to know the answer  But give it a shot  Way back when  When New York  Is being built  They probably put them  Underneath the city  And  They probably just  Forgot about them  Probably put them 
[01:03:00]  Underneath  No they did put them  Underneath  But they just  Forgot about them  Thinking that they won't work  Mulder and Scully  Said the alien  And I think  That that would be  A good call  If they do that  Yeah  Anyway  Okay  Anyway  Well  Holy crap  I  We really need to  Take a break  Anthony  God damn  Is that  Classic spaz  You have a take  On things  That I don't think  Anyone else  On this planet  Has 
[01:03:30]  There's a guy  Just yelling  We gotta get to  Hold on  Tommy  Guys  Yeah  I'm sitting here  I'm doing  Bong hits  And I'm  I don't know  If I'm really stoned  Or I'm losing my mind  I mean  I'm trying to  Disciple what  This guy's saying  I can't  I don't know  What's going on guys  You's erected me  You know what  It's hysterical man  I bet you  If you're on pot  It is very  I'm sitting here  I'm doing  Bong hits  I'm going  There's no way  That there's a human

[01:04:30]  Spaz's  Week in review  On the way spaz  What else do we have here  The Mexicans  Yes  Daylight savings time  I can't wait  I gotta take a leak  Because I'm ready to explode  I'm laughing so hard  I almost whizzed myself  Might as well go to the top  Of the building  See who's  Hit on the top of the head  Anthony  Oh damn  They're on to me  He has some words  On that again  And I think he's got  A little sports in here as well  A little sports in him  Anthony  Stay tuned 
[01:05:00]  What do you learn  On the show  I learn how to  Functioning idiot  Without a high school diploma  To get a job  On the radio  Obi and Anthony  Theater of the mindless  1027  WNEW  Biggest dumbass in town  Spaz Radio  Yes we're in the middle  Of spaz's  Week in review  On the O.P. and Anthony  Show  The anger  Coming out of the people  They can't  They can't believe  How stupid 
[01:05:30]  This man could be  Well  Psycho Mark  Is absolutely  Losing it  I went to go  Take a leak  I went to the bathroom  From a Psycho Mark  Studio  I'm hearing  Screaming  Psycho Mark  Is insane  About what  Spaz was talking about  The new pipes  That spaz  Has discovered  They found  Under the city  That they're gonna use  For fire  High pressure fire lines  So instead of fire hydrants  Here he comes  Look at him  He's ran  I'm bringing free talk 
[01:06:00]  You're all retarded  Because I can't  That's a loop  Of them  Dude  Fiber optic  Wires  They want to use  The water tunnel  For fiber optic  Wires  I read the same article  They're old tunnels  That go  Oh my god  And they want  Instead of digging up  The city  They want to use  Those existing tunnels  To lay fiber optic  Cable  And you saw  And you saw the fiber  As fire  Yes  Fiber optic 
[01:06:30]  Fiber optic  Cable  Fiber optic  Fiber optic  Cable  I thought I saw fire  Well that screws off  Your whole theory  There's fast  Just think  Thank god  You found out  In time  There would have been  Like lit up  Fire hydrants  On the fiber optic  But that's even better  Because now you can  Plug your modem  Into the fire hydrant  You can fight fire  Fight fire  From your cell phone 
[01:07:00]  While it's giving  See  It will cool the radiation  Down  From your cell phone  You can fight fire  As you check your email  Oh my god  Oh my god  Could you see  If he's like Columbus though  And we're all laughing  That the world is flat  And Columbus found out  It's round  And then you see  On the news  You know  It's like  Today  A cancerous alive wire  Has caused giant mosquitoes  To form people  Taking refuge  In the underground tunnels  That were recently  Found to fight fires with  Fiber optic wires  Do you know what  A fiber optic wire is  Spaz 
[01:07:30]  Yeah  Fiber optic  Fiber optic  Yeah it's used  In telecommunications  Oh  That's a money word  And how is it used  Spaz  It's used to  Carry current  As well  As well as  In formation  Waves  What?  Voice waves  Or  An electronic wave  Fiber optic  Why is it optic?  It can't be because 
[01:08:00]  Of the coating  Around it  Like the rubber  Psycho Mark  Is  I swear  Psycho Mark  Is so friggin  Like  I'm gonna lose my mind  I'm gonna throw myself  Off the bill  He's just like  Everyone in their car though  People are losing it  Robert  Robert what's up  Real fast  Robert  How you doing guys  Listen I'm a New York City fireman  And I made some phone calls  And I got my entire department  To agree that if you guys  Set Spaz on fire  We're not gonna put him out  Thank you Robert 
[01:08:30]  With the new crazy straw pipes  See Spaz  Because it's kind of bad  To just rag on him  Without maybe  Educating a little bit  Fiber optic  It uses light  Instead of current  You know how  The conventional copper wires  They send current over it  And information  Is sent  Through copper wires  Now they use light  And light  At certain intervals  It's translated  On the other end  As information  At light speed  Yes at light speed  At light speed  Correct  The mayor checking in Anthony  Oh really 
[01:09:00]  The pipes are as empty  As Spaz's head  Fire  Fiber  Common mistake  It could happen  Pretty close  We would like to use Spaz  As our poster boy  For birth control  Planned Parenthood  Oh and hey  Obviously the firemen  Could find the essence  Of the pipes  By using their Dalmatians  That's what the Dalmatians want  Go get it boy  Alright let's move on  With Spaz's week in review  I believe we're up  To the entertainment portion  Of the week in review  Anthony  And I believe  He has some commentary 
[01:09:30]  On the Supremes  Getting back together  Anyway  The Supremes are reuniting  Another old group  That's trying to  Come back together  To make comeback  Because they probably  Depleted all their  Bank accounts  From when they made  All their money  Back in the 50's  And 60's  But my message  To the Supremes  Is that  Nobody gives a crap  Because the people  Who listen to you  Are probably all dead  You're such an idiot  You're so  You're so stupid  Did you just curse? 
[01:10:00]  Stupid  You're so stupid  What the  Wait  But  So people  That were listening  To music  In the 50's  And 60's  They're all dead  Now  Well could be  Yeah  Now are all  The Supremes  Getting together  With Diana Ross?  Actually not  The original members  Oh really?  Yes  Okay  But is  Diana Ross  Involved in this?  Yes  And you don't think  She's had 
[01:10:30]  Some type of success  Since her days  With the Supremes  That maybe  She's not  Out of money  And maybe  It's sort of  A nostalgia thing  I'm amazed  That you know  Diana Ross  Probably had  A very good career  She has had  A very good career  Throughout the 60's  70's  80's  Yeah  I mean  She's been there  Every decade  I haven't followed  Her career either  I mean  Usually gay guys  Like that  We have to go  To the yelling  Guys on the phone  Jack  Oh god  I can't believe  You have this  Marlin on the air 
[01:11:00]  Good god almighty  He made a mistake  Between fiber  And fire  Hey  Let's go put out  That fiber  In the building  Over there  And then  We can  Hey some  Fire  Hey boys  But we can't  Like this  Oh  Like this  Oh damn  Alright Jack  Thank you  Oh my god  Oh unfortunately  His phone is becoming  Irradiated  As we speak  Quick throw your phone away  Throw your phone 
[01:11:30]  It's radiating  Matt Devote  What's up  The only other guy  That confused fire  And fiber  Was Mushmail  From uh  The fat Albert game  The fiber  Hey  Faber  I believe  There's a fiber  Over in the building  A fiber  No a fiber  What are you trying  To say fiber  No a fiber  And if it keeps  Burning  It's gonna burn  All the fiber  Optic  And the cables 
[01:12:00]  Spazzes say  The darndest things  Alright  Let's move on  With the  The talk  On the Supremes  Getting back together  They're all  The old fogies  They're sitting  In the nursery  Homes  And they're just  Nursery  That's just a quickie  The nursery  Homes  I just want to make sure  I heard that correctly  Nursery homes  I don't even need to know  Guys don't worry  They don't remember who you are 
[01:12:30]  Because they got the  Alzheimer's going  But the Supremes  Are getting back together  Diana Ross  But not even  Getting back together  With the two originals  So right off the bat  They're screwing over  Their whatever listeners  That are left  And um  They're getting back together  And uh  They're trying to make  A comeback tour  Much like all the other  Foggy groups  I mean nobody's  Gonna really listen  Because nobody's  Gonna buy their records  I mean you might  Find them on a  Best of record  But nobody's  Gonna buy any new  Records from these people  So you take their 
[01:13:00]  Big afro hair  That Diana Ross  Got  And just enjoy  Whatever memories  You have instead  Of trying to recapture  That's all I'm saying  Oh my dear  Sweet Jesus  Alright listen  Let's just let down  What's said  He gets everything wrong  I'm amazed  Yeah just  Whatever  And now one other  Portion of the  Entertainment break  Is Kevin Spacey  Uh there was no  Articles about  Well really  About Kevin Spacey  Except for winning  In the Oscars  For best actor  And for American Beauty 
[01:13:30]  But uh there are  Doubts that he  Is he straight  Or is he gay  I personally think  That he has the look  That he is gay  He has that kind of look  He has that kind of persona  He tries to hide it  And I understand  It's kind of hard  For people to come out  In the entertainment world  To say hey I'm gay  But other people  Have come out  Um  And said it  Like Sandra Bernhardt  She may be a woman  I know  It might be easier  For a woman  But I think  Kevin Spacey  Is gay  Hey  He should come out  And just say it  He's got that kind of face  That's contorted 
[01:14:00]  And whatever  He has a gayness  About him  And even some of the comments  I don't have him in front of me  But even some of the comments  He says in the paper  Conneigham's  That he could be gay  Hey  And that's my stance  On Mr. Spacey  A look  What's the gay look  What is the gay look  You know we're looking  At hands the other day  Because the post said  If your index finger  Is a lot shorter  Than your ring finger  You could be gay  They don't even need that test 
[01:14:30]  Spaz can tell  Just by looking at  Someone's contorted gay face  That they're gay  I'm astounded by this  What's the gay look  What is the gay look  We gotta make sure  We don't show up  To work with the gay look  It's a face that's round  And kind of drawn  You know  It's like round  More round  Instead of like  Rectangular  Oh my god  Anyone else  You could think of  Off the top of your head  In Hollywood  Or in the public eye  That has the gay face  Um  Not off the top of my head 
[01:15:00]  But he has  He has like gay  Like  Like drawn face  Like  Like gloom  Right  So gay equals gloom  That's from the cheeks  Making so much of that  Sucking motion  Right  That must be it  That gives you  The gay face  Anything on the gay ass  You got a theory on that  The gay face  It's rounded  Yet drawn  Sort of an oval  I'm trying to get a line 
[01:15:30]  On the gay face  And the hair too  The gay hair  Yes  Okay  Now Ricky Martin  Does he have a gay face?  Uh yes he does  Because also the gay face  Is the one that's like  Two pushed in on the sides  And it's more long  This way  More long  Two pushed in on the sides  Yes  And you have the short hair  Just like you  Spaz you have short hair  And you have a very oval face  Like your face is long  I'm not gay  But you have the gay  According to you  You have the gay face 
[01:16:00]  Like my  I don't know  Kevin Spacey is gay  Okay  You're convinced of it  Because of the gay look  He's got that essence about him  Alright  Like the pipe  He smells it  The essence that he likes  Pipe  You're smelling the essence  Of Kevin Spacey?  Yes  Yes of course  Alright  The dump pipe  Pat from Jersey  Who originally hired Spaz?  I hope they are now  Not with the station  Oh no  Ben hired them  That was me  Ben and Rick 
[01:16:30]  And they both should get raises  Okay  Kevin Spacey has the gay face  Gay face  I didn't know  We ought to just walk  Kevin around Manhattan  And he can point out  Gay people for us  That can be really funny  Alright let's move on  What is going on  In sports  We have  A fight  That has happened  With the New York Knicks  And the Los Angeles Lakers 
[01:17:00]  We have Kobe Bryant  And Chris Childs  Having a fist fight  On the basketball court  Now  I myself  Was a track runner  And I did play  Tackle football  When I was a  When I was a little tot  And I know  Sometimes things get heated  In sports  Because he got  That competitiveness  Competitive  Competitive  Competition going on  Hold on  I just cursed  He's sparky pig  You got me cursing 
[01:17:30]  I can't believe this  Hey we got to go back  He's got that  Competitive  Competitive  He's got the  Competitive  Competition  Sometimes things get heated  In sports  Because you got that  Competitiveness  Competitive  Competitive  Competitive  Competition going on  Boy's about as sharp  As a sack of wet mice  Got that 
[01:18:00]  Competitive  I say competitiveness  More than  As sharp  As a bowling ball  Okay  And  Sometimes it just gets heated  So  Chris Childs  Did open up  A crack to joy  Looks like  He got a really nice  Shot against Kobe  Because his jaw  Looks like  It was like  Moving from side to side  And  Because of that  Chris Childs gets a two game  Ban 
[01:18:30]  Kobe Bryant gets one  Now Childs  Is saying that  Kobe started the fight  So Kobe  Should be getting  The larger  Suspension  From games  And now Childs  Childs is currently  Now  Going to the NBA board  To  Confront this issue  And  Next week  I'll have an update  For you  About that  The Knicks look like  They're going to make  The playoffs  I believe  They are now  Four and a half  Games out  Of Indiana  To win the whole  Conference thingy  And  They're about a couple  Games back  Behind Miami  So my prediction 
[01:19:00]  Is the Knicks  Will make it  Okay  Now moving on  Soccer fans  Little ditty here  Two British soccer fans  Were killed  In Turkey  Istanbul  In Turkey  Because they were killed  Because  They liked  Their  Soccer team  In the playoffs  In Turkey  So  Soccer fans  Getting brutal  With each other  There  I understand  That people  Come having  Sports fans 
[01:19:30]  But they kill  Each other  Over a soccer game  Is just plain  Old stupid  Just have a good  Old fashioned  Shoddy match  And curse each other  Out  There's no need  To kill  We have enough  Violence in this world  Okay  Alright  No need  Now  On to the  Human interest story  Little oddities  That are happening  Around the world  In Mexico  The backwards country  That it is  It is now  Deciding  To culminate  With the rest  Of the world  In terms of  Daylight savings time  Now they want to  Just like  Wait wait wait  Culminate

[01:20:30]  Hey  I beat  I beat  I beat  I beat  That's awful  Oh my god  I can't believe  This guy  He's on the air  Hey  I think you guys  Should put him on  In the morning  He'll kill everybody  There's nobody  Who can beat  Spaz Radio  Alright Jack  Thank you  Let's go to Ray  Real fast  Ray what's up  Radio  You gotta get him  Off the radio  He's killing me  He's absolutely  Killing me  I wanna know  Why nobody else  Thinks this is said  Someday this boy 
[01:21:00]  Has gotta go out  Into society  And actually try  To make a go of it  Yeah  And I'm here to tell you  He doesn't have a shot  He needs to be  Institutionalized now  Alright well  Thank you Ray  Fornication now  Okay  Alright so  Mexico  Culminating  With the rest of  The  Culminating  The rest of the world  You said  Yes  As far as  Daylight savings goes  Yes  They were the  They were the  Last country  Holding out  As far as  Daylight savings goes  Right  As far as I know  Okay  Let's get back  To the  Spaz we can review 
[01:21:30]  It is now  Deciding  To  Culminate  With the rest  Of the world  In terms of  Daylight savings time  Now they wanna be  Just like the  Americans  And  Turn across  Ahead  And spring  And fall back  Just so  Because they wanna  Keep up their  Relations  And trading  With America  But the  Reason why  They said  That they  Didn't do it  Before  Is because  It affects  Good marital  Relations  While many  Couples had  Sex  Before going 
[01:22:00]  To sleep  There are  Others who  Make love  When they  Wake up  But now  When you  Wake up  Your partner  Is no longer  There  Because she  Had to  Take her  Kids  To school  And ours  Is not  Gonna make  A difference  If  My significant  Other  Or if I  Want to  Have sex  If she's  Asleep  When I  Get home  From work  I'm gonna  Wake her up  She's gonna  Wake me up  It doesn't  Matter what  Time  Sex happens  You wake  The person  Up  If you're  In a mood  If both  Are  Intensive  Turning  The cards  Ahead 
[01:22:30]  And back  It's not  Gonna affect  Everything  I don't  Understand  The logic  Of Mexicans  Mexicans  Are stupid  Why do you  Think they're  Working for  Pesos  Instead of  The American  Dollar  When the  Pesos  Is less  Than the  American  Dollar  In the  Exchange  Market  I mean  It's just  Totally  Ridiculous  They're a  Backward  Frigging  Country  And  They don't  Get the  Basics  Turning  Ahead  To  Clock  And  Back  Whatever  Is not  Gonna  Affect  The  Relations  Of  You're  Trading  With  America  It's 
[01:23:00]  Stupid  But  That's  Their  Point  In  Their  Title  Now  Oh  My  God  Alright  We  Have  A  Definition  On  Culminate  To  Reach  Its  Highest  Altitude  To  Be  Directly  Overhead  To  Rise  To  Or  From  A  Summit  To  Reach  The  Highest  Or  Climactic  Or  Decisive  Point  To  Bring  To  Ahead  Or  The  Highest  Point  Well  Now  That  You  Told  Us  The  Definition

[01:29:00]  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Okay, great.  Okay, terrific.  And with that...  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  And with that, Anthony, I believe we wrap up this week's Spaz Week in Review.  Bravo.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Stupid! 
[01:29:30]  Freaking brilliant.  They ought to teach that in schools.  You know, we have Kevin Pollack coming in, who's a very, very funny guy.  Very funny guy.  Respected actor, too.  Yes, playing rascals all weekend long.  Call me crazy, but I'm going to suggest Kevin Pollack has you open for him tonight.  You can just stand on stage and give your theories on stuff.  Spaz.  There he goes.  He's our Spaz.  You can't have him. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  He's all ours.  All right, and we've got to take a quick break.  Still on the way.  Oil wrestling.  Yeah.  Jay Moore.  That's good for Friday.  And up next, Kevin Pollack.  Stay there.  I was laughing so hard, I farted.  Oh, this just in from Vinny.  Yeah.  Former president of Iona College dies in a three-alarm fiber at local nursery home.  And with that, Anthony, we've got to talk about MindSpring.  Yes.  We don't have to, but we would like to talk about MindSpring.  We love MindSpring. 
[01:30:30]  They're a great internet service, right, Anthony?  Yes.  Teamed up with Earthlink.  Yes.  And now they're better than ever.  Poor Spaz can't use this because it's Earthlink.  You have to be of this planet.  You have to wait for Venuslink.  Yes.  MindSpring has won all sorts of awards, Anthony.  They're an award-winning service.  Free customer support, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, toll-free.  A lot of people ranting and raving about MindSpring internet services.  And this is the key point of this read here, Anthony.  You call MindSpring right now at 1-888-MSPRING. 
[01:31:00]  You call them today, and MindSpring will give you the first three months of service for the price of one.  That's three months of service for the price of one if you call MindSpring internet services right now.  1-888-MSPRING.  That's 1-888-MSPRING for MindSpring internet services.  Opie.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:31:30]  We've just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  No, I don't think so.  I think Spaz makes us all look like geniuses.  Yeah, it's good to keep him around for that reason.  Makes us look really smart.  It's the O&A show.  Oh, my God, there he is.  This is a real Hollywood actor.  It's about time we've got someone real in here.  Entering the studio, of course, Kevin Pollack playing Rascals tonight and tomorrow night.  Tonight it's Ocean Township.  Tomorrow night at West Orange. 
[01:32:00]  Call Rascals for ticket information.  Spaz was sitting in that seat, I hope.  I hope it's not like creative kryptonite now.  I'm leaving.  He's got some kind of brain cell eating disease.  It's soft and gooey.  You know what the best part of that is?  I swear to you, that is real.  That is an authentic human being.  Barely.  But he really feels strongly about his ideas.  He's a giver.  Yes, he is. 
[01:32:30]  A lot of people take, take, take.  Not the Spaz man.  He's a giver.  He's a giver.  Did you hear some of the Spaz radio?  I couldn't get enough.  It's like a car wreck.  Kevin, how do you follow that?  I mean...  You don't.  You don't.  You mire in it.  You don't even try.  Amazing.  Kevin goes to Rick.  Does this guy really have a job here?  No, my question was, how did he get on the radio?  And then I heard the whole story about how that's now cut out a portion of the show that  is dedicated to Spaz, all Spaz, all the time.  Yes.  It's Spaz radio at its best. 
[01:33:00]  Spaz radio.  So how have you been?  Good?  Good.  Yeah, sure.  You know.  Back in New York now.  Swinging in New York.  You can't beat this town.  You're always in...  Where do you live?  Hollywood?  Smell A.  Yeah.  Smell A.  We just got back from Smell A.  Scumhole of the universe.  Yeah, we were there for a while.  Where are you from?  San Francisco, the other great city.  Ah.  Yeah.  North of L.A.  Yeah.  Quite north.  Well, we were trained growing up to hate Los Angeles.  Really?  Literally trained.  It starts when we're very young.  How old are you kids?  Six?  Pay attention.  We got reading, arithmetic, writing. 
[01:33:30]  L.A. sucks.  One more time.  Here we go.  Well, nobody really likes L.A.  Even the people that live there.  That's true.  Because they're from other places, and they're there because they have to be.  That's right.  For a job.  Horsville.  Yeah.  That's what they should call it.  Yeah.  Because we're all there for money.  Well, you seem to be doing very well, though.  Well, I grab my ankles like the best of them.  He's reading through some of your credits and realize, oh, my God, you know.  He's been in a lot of people.  Every movie, I think.  Yeah.  That came out in the 90s.  You just think stand-up comic a lot of times.  You can turn on Comedy Central and see you at wee hours of the morning, but then you're like, 
[01:34:00]  wow, look at that.  HBO 2.  Sure.  That's right.  He's in a lot of movies.  If you've got the little dish, it's tough to avoid me.  Yeah, yeah.  As long as you're trying.  Very talented.  A lot of people don't know that, though.  I think a lot of people still think of you as the stand-up comic guy.  Well, you know, it's weird, actually.  Mostly I get people who come up and they like the usual suspects or a few good men or the  grumpy old men movies, and they don't know that I started out in stand-up.  I mean, I was in stand-up for over 20 years, but A Few Good Men came out at the same  time as my last HBO special, and A Few Good Men was this juggernaut, you know, 
[01:34:30]  a $450 million hit worldwide, and how people discover you is kind of how they know you  and remember you, you know.  So it just kind of stepped all over this 20 years of stand-up, which, you know, that's  fine.  However they know you, damn it, that's important.  That's all that matters.  A little easier than going around the country all the time, though, doing stand-up.  What are you saying?  I'm saying you must have done that early on in your career, where you're just taking the  red eyes, little clubs, Chinese restaurant back rooms. 
[01:35:00]  The road is a love fest.  All that stuff, yeah.  So you made it out, you know?  Yeah.  So now I'm doing it for fun.  Yeah.  Any observations about New York?  Any observations?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  There's always something going on on the streets of New York every day.  Well, actually, I have this...  I can tell you what we learned yesterday.  Sure, please.  I don't know if you heard the last segment of Spaz Radio, but we learned that there are  guys on the top of buildings taking leaks on the people of New York.  That's not rain. 
[01:35:30]  No.  No.  Is what you're saying.  It's urine.  It's certainly not rain.  Right.  And potentially more dangerous than acid rain.  Yes.  Urinating terrorists.  Wow.  On our city.  So if you're going to walk around the streets, make sure you're walking in the middle of the  road or something.  Yeah.  There's a lot of stuff falling from the top of buildings, so I didn't think we had to worry about  urine as well, but...  And then the whole controversy with somebody you worked with, Kevin Spacey.  Mm-hmm.  You know, Spaz seems to think he has the gay face.  Now, this...  You don't have to comment, Kevin. 
[01:36:00]  I understand you got...  He has the gay face.  Spaz is so talented.  Wow.  What he lacks in brain power, he makes up in the fact that he can look at somebody.  Observational skills.  And just by their face, tell if they're gay.  Sounds like something my Aunt Bessie would say.  He's got the gay face.  He's got the gay face.  I don't care so much for him with the gay face.  Kevin, would you mind if Spaz came in here and took a look at your face?  No.  Well, yes.  Yes, I would, because I would have to ultimately look at his face.  See, Spaz, you have what they call the shining. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  You can tell.  Get Spaz, because he's the gay shining.  So he's like this weird psychic...  Yeah.  More psychotic.  We haven't quite figured it out yet.  There he is.  As long as he doesn't have to lay on the hands.  All right.  No, no.  Spaz, grab that mic there.  First, Spaz, are you familiar with Kevin or any of his works?  Yes.  Actually, I saw you in Ricochet, which is...  Well, go ahead and pick the worst film I've ever been in.  Yeah, right?  Spaz is really up.  That is...  All the movies this guy's done, he's worked with De Niro. 
[01:37:00]  This guy's worked with the best of them.  34 films.  He's got right to the bottom line.  Kevin Spaz.  There, you see, now you're coming...  Yeah, because I just mentioned it nine times on the earth.  Thank you.  Nicholson.  Tom Cruise.  Why don't you mention end of days while I...  Do I have the gay face?  No, you don't.  Thank you very much.  Take the rest of the minute off.  Now, here's the thing.  End of days.  Yes.  Donald.  I loved you in House of Rest.  Yeah, right.  Well, stuck in a basement with Jamie Lee Fitness. 
[01:37:30]  You know, it's tough to...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  All right.  So he doesn't have the gay face.  No, he doesn't.  Okay.  But Kevin Spacey does.  Yes, because...  Oh, well, we don't even need an explanation.  That's it.  They just do.  That's the beginning and the end of it.  Did Preskin explain his powers?  No.  He picked the person in the audience with the envelope with the right thing in it.  He didn't explain how he knew or why.  That's all.  The guy, the Russian, that bent the spoons.  What the hell is his name?  Yuri Geller.  Yuri Geller.  He didn't explain how he did it.  He just did it. 
[01:38:00]  You can pick the gay face.  That's it, Spaz.  Never offer up the story behind the edges.  No.  No.  No.  You don't want people looking behind the curtain.  There he is.  All right, Kevin.  David Copperfield of the gay.  Yeah.  I don't know what it is.  So you were saying.  I was saying.  I don't even know, but...  Now he's stunned.  I know.  The end of days thing.  Yeah.  Did you mention that?  You mentioned that.  Somebody mentioned that.  I said, Spaz, why don't you mention it?  Oh, it is.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  You know, it's great, actually, working with the Schwarzenegger.  Yeah.  Because he really is, when you think about it, kind of our Superman, in the sense that  he's this real live-action figure.  Yeah.  You know?  It's weird being around him.  Because my friends and family would visit the set, you know?  And it was like they were waiting to hear a catchphrase.  Honestly, in his regular speaking, you know?  I mean, I was trying to say to them, listen, he's in his 50s now, you know?  Is he?  The only catchphrase you're going to hear is, I'm tired. 
[01:39:00]  You know?  Give him a break.  And he had this huge 18-wheeler truck filled with workout equipment.  It was transformed into a gym.  Wow.  With these glass doors.  So, during lunch, he'd be in there working out.  And I'd be walking by from the lunch.  So, people could watch him through the glass door?  Well, I don't know what the premise was.  I know, for me, I just walked by with, like, some cake and pie.  Yeah.  Just eating away, saying, you pump up, buddy.  I'm going to have me some cream and cake.  Yeah, it's got to be rough working with someone like him.  Yeah.  Shape and stuff.  He might be self-conscious. 
[01:39:30]  Jamie Lee Curtis, another one you worked with, and she's definitely in shape.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  She's all about shape.  And that's a girl.  So, what do you do?  Suck it in as you're walking by her?  Pretty much.  Suck it in or stick it out.  Those are your two options.  Yes.  But the thing, you know, about Arnold, give him all the grief.  He's living the American dream.  He is.  Think about it.  He grew up in a small country.  We're in the back of a comic book.  He could pump iron and come to America, right?  He pumps way too much iron, comes to America,  becomes the number one box office girl in the world,  makes over $20 million a picture, 
[01:40:00]  plus he's nailing a Kennedy.  So, come on.  That's not the American dream.  I don't know where to grow up.  It doesn't suck.  No, that's it.  Well, people are freaking out.  They want to talk to you.  Let's go to Brad.  Hey, Brad, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's happening?  Hey.  I just wanted to make a comment with Kevin.  I think my favorite role he ever played was on Wayne's World,  when Wayne had to get the permit to do the Wayne stock.  Yeah, the...  Oh, with the eye.  Yeah, when Wayne goes, I'd give my right eye.  And then he looks up and he's got that contact on.  You know, it's hilarious.  He got all about that.  That was an ocular albino. 
[01:40:30]  That by far has got to be one of the funniest things.  You're a real funny dude, man.  I enjoy your work.  Well, then we'll see you out of Rascals tonight or tomorrow night.  What show's good for you?  Tomorrow night's good.  All right, we'll see you then.  Pencil me in.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  Later, guys.  He got all about that scene until he brought it up.  And, of course, very great with the impressions.  Sure.  I mean, that's like a great part of your act.  I love it.  Yeah, and I'm just now gearing down the Clinton thing because, you know, you've got to let go.  He's on his way out.  And it's tough.  It's always tough for comics not doing impressions.  He just kept giving. 
[01:41:00]  You talk about being a giver.  God, he's the best.  You know, think about it.  First of all, it amazes me that anyone wants to be president.  I mean, you talk about a healthy ego.  To decide at one point, I want to and must be the single most powerful man in the free world.  That's what I'm going to do with the rest of my life.  I need that.  Otherwise, I suck.  I need that on my resume.  And then to become that, to actually get to that place, as fluky as that is, and to be sitting in the White House and realize there's got to be a way to make this whole thing just a little bit sweeter. 
[01:41:30]  No, no, I understand, fellas.  I'm the president.  Yeah, that's cool.  But some way to make this deal just a little bit sweeter.  What can I do?  Oh, hey, Monica.  Did you bring in some pizza?  Don't forget, the first time you saw her, you know, it wasn't a thong.  She was carrying pizza.  She went right to this boy's belly.  That's how she got him.  Yeah, that feels good.  What is that, pepperoni?  That's extra cheese.  Speaking of which, you might want to clean up that dress. 
[01:42:00]  She can take it to the dry cleaners, whatever.  You know, I'm going to miss him.  Yeah.  I'm going to miss him in a huge way.  And Gore, the weird thing is that he can't even use the distancing himself from Clinton during the campaign.  How much does it suck when you can't use the president of the United States on your job application?  Oh, yeah.  A two-turner.  Yeah, right?  A two-turner.  A two-turner.  As a reference.  Yeah, right.  Well, I had an idea because, you know, being in radio and stuff, as being in comedy, you want a president in there like Clinton who just, like you said, is a giver.  Well, then you've got to, I guess you're going to Bush rep. 
[01:42:30]  No, no.  He'll give.  No.  I have a long shot idea, but I really would love for this to happen.  All right.  Gore chooses as his running mate, Bill Clinton.  Oh, Bill Clinton.  Bring him back.  And resign after the first day.  You've got to have four more years.  Four more years.  Call him back.  Yeah.  You know?  It's good to be back.  Yeah, only he could pull off something like that, too.  Yeah.  You know, Bradley never had a chance, by the way.  No.  I'll tell you why, though.  No, not because he didn't have game. 
[01:43:00]  He certainly had game.  But, you know, we never heard from his wife.  Oh, my God!  I almost saw Jay Moore's penis.  You're insane.  I used the word penis loosely.  Because he's got the 501.  Have you had sex with Jay Moore?  No, not today.  I only came by to give the respect, Kevin.  Oh, very nice.  Rascals, right?  Sure.  All right, there you go. 
[01:43:30]  I just want to lean over to you.  Kevin Pollack at Rascals, everybody.  I have nothing to plug, so I'm just going to pimp Kevin Pollack.  All right.  That's good.  I'm here for the lesbian mud wrestling.  Oil wrestling.  You want to see some oil wrestling there, Kevin?  You see oil, I say mud.  That's good for either way.  I was thinking we could do Shatner and walking on the Enterprise later.  Take it over for Kathy and Regis Lee.  Oh, come on.  I got Kytel now, too, if you want to work some of your new guys in.  All right.  How about Alan Arkin and Harvey Kytel? 
[01:44:00]  Okay.  Give us a location and occupation.  We're going to do freeze-its now.  Let's not get off the subject.  Kevin Pollack, one of the best impressionists in the world,  who's in a movie with Tom Cruise called A Few Good Men.  Yes, of course.  Have you heard about it?  Of course.  He's going to be at Rascals in West Orange.  He's the best plugger, man.  And then everyone's going to go to the Verona Inn.  You want this guy on your side.  Then everybody's going to the Verona Inn afterwards.  Kevin's going to buy the entire audience a round at the Verona Inn.  Don't worry.  Is that the place to go afterwards? 
[01:44:30]  Oh, yeah.  You've got to go to the V.I.  Uh-huh.  The V.I.  This is like, we have gone totally Hollywood now.  Look at this.  I like this.  Big movie star.  If I may.  Look at this, yeah.  It's Alan Huck.  I'd just like to ask a question to Harvey.  Harvey, you know, I did this film called The In-Laws,  and I'm thinking about doing a remake,  and I would love to do it with you.  I don't know if this is a bad time to bring this up.  Listen, Alan, get with the program. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  When was the last time the World Series didn't go seven games?  The revenue money alone between...  Listen, gentlemen, women get raped every day.  Now, because this one wears a penguin suit,  they put a reward up.  The church ate the racket.  Aren't you a Catholic?  I'm a Catholic.  I'm freaking blessed.  I'm a Catholic. 
[01:45:30]  What could kill me?  Lady, get with the program.  Alan Arkin was in Glengarry.  Glenn Ross!  Put it, Harris!  Jesus, that's good.  Wow, that's pretty good.  Nobody really knows him, though.  I love Alan Arkin, too.  Yeah, the Arkin's great.  You were the first dead on Christopher Walken.  No, Roger Cabler was the first.  Oh, really?  Well, you were the first to do it on TV.  But you do it on the air!  Yeah, if you were a comic, 
[01:46:00]  that doesn't bother me.  That doesn't bother me.  That's...  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  That's so insane.  There was a huge brawl.  There was a huge brawl.  I actually read about it.  Read about it in the train.  You've got to see the video.  You'll laugh until you kiss yourself.  I bounced one off his forehead outside the diner.  I didn't think I got a hold of him,  but when I downloaded the video,  I actually bounced one off his forehead.  Yeah.  We all feel a lot closer today.  Yeah.  We've been through a war together. 
[01:46:30]  It's unbelievable.  Kevin Spacey, Rascal's West Orange.  Kevin Spacey?  Kevin...  Kevin Spacey's got the gay face.  He's got the gay face.  Oh, well.  What, what, what, what?  Let's get...  How much are the tickets for Rascals?  Whatever you need.  No, no.  How much are they?  I have no idea.  It's probably like, what, 15, 17 dollars?  I have no...  Literally have no idea.  Because for me, it's like $25.  Oh, really?  So people that are pissed off,  they go see a guy that's just as funny  and save $10, $20 if you bring in a chick.  And also, thanks to you, 
[01:47:00]  they'll see Christopher Walken.  Because I was working on a Walken  and you gave me...  The key.  The key.  The, uh, the...  Two syllables.  One syllable is two syllables.  It's a two-syllable word.  No, sometimes it's easier  finding, uh, getting an impression  from a guy that's doing an impression  than it is.  Everyone doing George Bush right now  is doing Dana Carvey doing George Bush.  Right.  In fact, I came out of the San Francisco  stand-up gene pool with Dana Carvey  like 20 years ago  and we've stayed great friends ever since  and so when he was working on Ross Pearl,  I was working on it at the same time  because Ross was in the news  and we sort of nailed it 
[01:47:30]  on the phone together  and I said,  but wait a second.  You get to go on Saturday night  with a game for everybody.  You're ripping them off.  And I'll be screwing, Chuck.  You'll be at Uncle Sputchy's  Chuckle Hunt.  Can I finish?  Can I finish?  What do I have to do?  I cannot believe  in the last election  I got my ass kicked  by that drunken gillbilly  at Old Father Time.  That is not a pencil in his hand.  That was a sickle.  What do I have to do?  The people I will pay your taxes. 
[01:48:00]  That's what I'll do.  You fill out the form,  I write the checks.  There you go.  God damn.  Just keep doing can I finish.  Can I finish?  Well, Mr. Pro.  Can I finish?  Yes, you can.  Can I finish?  Okay, I'm good.  Can I finish?  Can I finish?  Can I finish?  His ears are getting bigger  as he gets older.  He's looking like Yoda now.  Delegates, you must have.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:48:30]  I just went to Miller's  Washington special  and his HBO special.  It's pretty old,  but he goes,  I was a Perot man.  The crazier that old bastard got,  the more I wanted him  to drive us  into the center of the sun.  It's true.  Oh, I love Perot.  I can't even attend to Perot.  An analogy for everything  and they never make sense for you.  The economy, see,  is like peanut butter.  If you feed it to a horse  and he cues on it,  it'll look like he's talking.  What?  Mr. Pro,  I'm not sure what you mean. 
[01:49:00]  Can I finish?  Spaz got it.  Spaz got it.  It makes sense.  I don't want to put you  on the spot,  but Spaz,  grab the mic.  We did this to Kevin Pollack  a little while ago.  Spaz has the shine  and he can tell  if a guy is gay  just by looking at his face  if you have the gay face.  All right.  Spaz,  does Jay Moore  have the gay face?  He's making eyes at him.  Well,  he does have that  pushed in on the side  like I said  where it makes this look.  That's called cheekbones,  you ape.  It's called you die 
[01:49:30]  in a certain way  to make your face look nice.  That's right.  What a jack.  Kevin Pollack,  rascals,  Western.  Much more affordable.  I mean it for a family.  It's like a twins game  compared to a nink.  Wait a second.  What makes you assume  that they're going to be  charging less?  I'm just getting them to crawl.  I'm just getting them to crawl,  rascals,  then they're roped in.  Kevin,  just go with it.  He's the king of plums.  No,  it's nine dollars.  Wait,  where's it?  Now he's behind me?  They probably do  because Jay  negotiates his door deal 
[01:50:00]  right here on the phone.  Right here on the air.  I'm in the studio now.  I could start pumping up  Monday right now.  All right.  Facts are through.  You're from there,  right?  I'm from the next town over,  Verona.  Seriously?  Thus the Verona Inn.  In the Garden State.  Which I own a piece of  the Verona Inn now.  You sure?  Oh, yeah.  I wish I did.  It's Kevin Pollack,  Rascals,  West Orange.  I want to know  if I'm gay or not by spelling.  Actually,  is Pollack gay?  No, he's not.  No.  Oh, man, 
[01:50:30]  you're wrong already.  Rascals,  Ocean Township tonight  for Kevin Pollack.  Explain this to me.  West Orange tomorrow.  I understand West Orange  the whole thing.  I haven't.  West Orange is tomorrow night.  Yeah,  there's two of them.  And the Ocean Township,  it's a little smaller,  more rowdy.  It's the Jersey Shore  in the wintertime.  Hello.  You need to get on a plane  to get there from here.  No, you don't.  It's an hour.  What's 50 feet long  in his 11 teeth?  The front row.  Ouch.  Hey, Dave,  what's going on? 
[01:51:00]  Can I finish?  Yeah,  I was wondering if  Pollack and Anthony  could compare  Shatner impressions.  Whoa.  Oh,  well,  I do a caricature  of Shatner.  He does the Shatner.  I mean,  Jesus Christ.  Shatner's a stranger  than doing the radio,  actually.  Yeah,  because it is very visual.  And you also have to  pause so long  that you create dead air,  which is always a bad thing.  Not if you both do it  at the same time.  We do it.  We do it during the  Priceline ad.  It would be like  a moonlighting episode.  You guys fill in  each other's sentences.  You.  got to get out of this place.  I'm going to get out of this place.  Kevin Pollack, 
[01:51:30]  Ocean Township Rascals.  If it's the last thing,  we have a deal.  You know,  he had this new book out,  Get a Life.  Yeah,  yeah.  And he called me up  and asked me to explain  to him and his,  I'm making quotation marks  in the air,  ghost writer,  how to do William Shatner  for the book,  literally.  Oh,  so you could do it at home.  There's a seven page  excerpt in the book  about how I explain.  Juggling for morons  in the center  of the three beanbags.  Yeah.  So I'm in the book  as teaching people 
[01:52:00]  how to do the Shatner.  Teaching people  how to do Shatner.  But now he says,  come over and explain this,  you know,  to me and the other writer.  And I'm in the car saying,  I've been,  you know,  ripping into this guy  for 15 years,  saying he's the king  of overacting  for no apparent reason.  Didn't I tell you  about Priceline?  Yeah.  And now I have to  explain it to him  why he's such a bad actor.  Yeah.  How am I going to do this?  And yet get in the book  because now I'm excited  to get in the book.  But you can't not go  to Shatner.  You have to.  Absolutely.  So I'm driving over  and I make up this thing  and I literally say this  to him in the room. 
[01:52:30]  Right?  And this is how I say,  well, you know, Bill,  yes,  uh,  uh,  yes,  Kevin.  Which,  which wig was he wearing?  Was he wearing  the geranium  or the possum?  It was the,  the,  the summer,  summer,  uh,  hat.  And,  uh,  yeah,  go ahead,  please.  So I said,  uh,  you know,  the show,  the sets were really  rinky dink  and,  uh,  you know,  the costumes were awful  and the makeup  was stupid and ridiculous.  I'm talking about  T.J. Hooker.  Yeah.  And some of the storylines 
[01:53:00]  were lame.  So you're not only  the captain of the ship,  you're the captain of the show.  You had to sort of  thrust your chest out  and be overly dramatic  in order to make  the audience care.  And then you created  these pauses  to build up the drama.  And he says in the book,  he,  he,  like,  uh,  editorializes in the book  as I'm explaining this.  And he editorializes,  at that point,  I realize,  uh,  uh,  and he has the,  uh,  uh,  in the book.  I realize,  uh,  that,  that Kevin was right. 
[01:53:30]  Uh,  but as far as the pausing goes,  the only reason I pause  so much in the show  is because I forgot my lines.  So he duked me.  And then he said,  I do you doing me and my act.  I said,  you have an act?  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  I,  I,  I do shows  and,  and conventions  and,  uh,  Vegas.  Vegas?  No,  I do Vegas.  And,  uh,  and,  and,  and they know you.  They know you do me.  And so I do you doing me.  I go,  this guy's pimping me now.  Oh,  no. 
[01:54:00]  So it was like the total burn.  That's fantastic.  He owns me.  Shatner now owns me.  How long is that?  He turned it around on you.  How long have you been married there,  uh,  Pollock?  Uh,  four years.  Been together 14 years.  Slipped it right under the 10th year anniversary.  So you were a common law marriage before you were actually married.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah.  That's the thing I don't understand,  though,  is the common law thing.  You lived together for seven years.  Yeah.  You're married.  L.A.  Or California law.  United States.  Not in New York.  Yes,  it is.  No,  it isn't.  United States. 
[01:54:30]  Is this going to be another fight?  Because I don't need to say it.  Yeah,  we don't have the goons around today.  Once you pounce knuckles off a 350-pound guy's forehead,  where do you go from now?  Where do you take me?  Me and Belvin in the kiddie pool.  He was that big?  250?  No,  350.  350.  350.  350 short.  Jeez.  But you're not talking 350 like,  uh,  you know,  built 350?  Yeah.  Like a superhero.  But you have to commit.  There's no...  Oh,  there was...  There was a commitment.  Are we going to play the tapes?  You've got to see.  Kevin's got to hear it. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah,  where's some of the clip?  Yeah,  we could get that.  Get Ricky Brad.  Kevin Pollock,  Ocean Township Rascals.  Tonight.  Big fat black stories tomorrow.  Few good men?  Nine dollars.  Nine dollars.  It's very cheap.  All right,  listen,  we'll get the tapes,  we'll take a break.  You're hanging for a little while,  right,  Kevin?  Kevin Pollock.  Where the hell am I going?  Ocean Township,  you better go see Kevin Pollock.  How soon do I need to leave  to get there by the 8 o'clock show?  Uh,  8.30.  Now.  That's it.  Now.  8.30 is the show.  8.30 and 11, 
[01:55:30]  I think it's the show.  No,  you just jump on,  go out the Lincoln Tunnel  and get Parkway South  and you'd be on,  uh,  Turnpike South Parkway.  Yeah,  it'd be an hour.  Yeah?  With traffic?  What time's the show?  You should get going.  Yeah,  really,  man.  Finally,  he goes for the job.  You should get going to  Ocean Township Rascals  where Kevin Pollock  will be doing  all of his  schtickish shit.  There's a guy  that plays Vegas,  you know,  sells out like,  not Harris,  that's too small a room  for Kevin Pollock. 
[01:56:00]  You know,  you play Vegas,  you're in all the big rooms.  Yeah,  absolutely.  Caesars.  Now he's in Ocean Township  at Rascals,  a great club.  Yeah.  You get to go down there  and,  uh,  you get to see  a big fat  freaking movie star.  Not fat,  but literally,  figuratively,  you get to see  a big fat  freaking movie star.  PH,  you guys worked  with all the best.  All right,  listen,  let's go to work  with Jack Nicholson.  We'll take a break.  We'll take a break.  We'll do a couple more minutes  with Kevin Pollock  and get him on the road  to Rascals,  Ocean Township  tonight,  okay?  Right.  All right,  tickets still available.  Call Rascals for info. 
[01:56:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Jews are just  a bunch of guys  sweating and burping  and farting.  Hail to the kings  of the radio.  1027-70-NEW.  All right,  here he comes.  Anthony's eagle,  but Opie's worse  than Hitler.  We're off to a flying start  here on the Opie  and Cool and Inhuman Show.  1027-70-NEW.  Okay,  we're hanging with  Kevin Pollock  in the studio  playing Rascals  tonight in Ocean Township.  Tomorrow night,  Rascals in West Orange. 
[01:57:00]  Call Rascals first.  Stick it up, Bob.  Wait, wait, wait.  I wrote this song.  Yeah!  Does that get a bat  and beat somebody  over the head  by I hate everybody?  Yeah, pretty much.  I'd play that backstage  in dressing room  right before I go on.  Gets you pumped up.  How sad, pathetic  would that be?  Just sitting in backstage  davening over the Torah  while that music  plays. 
[01:57:30]  Chris, what's going on?  You two.  Opie Anthony,  J, Kevin,  how you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  We should get  some Christopher Walken  between J and Kevin.  See who's better.  No, not between.  Amongst.  Amongst,  allegedly.  No competition  between Kevin and I.  Hey, J.  I learned from him.  He's the master.  He's the Jedi warrior.  I don't believe  I've heard Kevin.  I studied at his feet.  We haven't heard  Kevin's Walken.  So this will be  Walken having  an inner dialogue  with himself  about what to do  tonight in New York. 
[01:58:00]  Well,  it's one or the other.  Jinx,  I'm excited.  You should be.  Ocean Township.  It's a little  of nowhere.  Oh.  Can't wait  to see the front row.  Sign it.  They're going to be  looking up at you.  Daddy, daddy,  tell us something.  It's crazy.  All of them.  The place holds  two,  two hundred ninety people.  I got a feeling  you're going to go  at least one eighty. 
[01:58:30]  Whether to  let the package  lie to the left  or the right,  that's a question.  Not sure.  Contemplate.  Whatever.  Short decision.  Come on,  Chris.  You've got to  get out of here.  Traffic.  You've got to  wait for these  girls to  mud wrestle.  Maybe I'll stay.  Stay.  I love it  when it goes down deep.  I'm going to put  both of those girls  in my ass. 
[01:59:00]  I love it  when it goes down deep.  It's like,  where are you going,  Chris?  Come back.  I got places to go.  We were doing  in Suicide Kings.  You know,  he's taped to the chair  in the whole movie  and he's duct taped  to a chair  and for his eye line  to the five guys,  there's five of us,  I had to stand  on the couch  behind the camera  because it's got to  look like he's  looking up at me  and he's in the middle  of like a two-page speech  like,  well,  it must have seemed  like a good idea  at the time. 
[01:59:30]  You're thinking it up.  It's the drugs.  Hey, Jay,  you're the eight-foot man.  Oh, my God.  And the director goes,  Chris, you're killing me.  He goes,  take that pot out.  He looks at him  like he's going  to kill him.  Oh, my God.  You're the eight-foot man.  Chris, you're killing me.  Take that pot out.  Like he was going  to kill him.  I actually dressed up  for the kids  in the neighborhood  for Halloween  when they come to the door  because I don't want 
[02:00:00]  to be that bastard.  Remember,  you were a kid,  you'd ring the doorbell  and from inside,  you'd hear,  yeah, yeah, I'm coming.  You don't want  to be that guy.  So I dressed up  for the kids  when this year  I did walking  when they came to the door.  Trick or trade.  Good question.  Hey,  I got a question.  Which one of you  can guess  what I buried  under my house?  Where you going, kids?  I got ring dings  and Winston lights.  Hey.  That's my little gift.  And now I got to hit the road  because I'm going  to the Olsen place.  Yes.  Don't you brascals? 
[02:00:30]  Kevin Pollack,  movie star.  Few good men.  That's the one  I remember the most,  Kevin.  You carried Tommy  in that Maguire picture  like nobody's business.  You turned him  into Samsonite,  my friend.  All right, Kevin.  Thanks for the time, fellas.  Do we?  Yes.  I got to hit the road.  He's got to go.  He's got to go.  Friday traffic to Jersey.  Actually,  the car's bringing  up at 515,  a range,  but a joint,  so I got to be there.  Oh, God.  I don't want it  to be like I chased him out.  Not at all.  I came to pimp.  Not at all.  Thanks, brother.  We'll see you guys. 
[02:01:00]  Thank you, Kevin.  Real pleasure.  We'll be an Anthony fan.  Make yourselves known  at Ocean Township Rascals.  Very funny, man.  Kevin Pollack,  tonight,  Rascals Ocean Township,  tomorrow night,  West Orange.  There he goes,  walking out.  Kevin Pollack,  and he does not have  the gay face,  according to Spaz.  According to Spaz.  I got an incomplete.  Yeah,  you didn't quite get judged.  Well, I'm gay  because I have blonde hair.  Right,  we learned that already,  so.  See,  Kevin's got  the shining.  He can tell  if you're gay 
[02:01:30]  just by looking  at the face.  Hey, Spaz,  where's Spaz?  Am I gay or not?  Yeah,  let's get Spaz.  Let's finish this up.  Because I've been  thinking about it.  Jay,  before we get Spaz  back in here,  we have a problem  with the oil wrestling.  They said one chick.  How do you have  oil wrestling?  Why is everything  self-destruct like that  on this show?  We had two chicks  set up for oil wrestling.  One shows up.  What's she going to do?  What's the other one?  A show world?  How far away is that?  We'll probably get one  from Peat Plant 
[02:02:00]  or something.  Pressing engagement.  You tired of working  for quarters?  We'll give you 40 bucks.  Yeah, exactly.  Come on down.  So, I don't know.  I got my corn tickets  that I can't use  tomorrow night.  Paul,  who wants to take on  the girl we're wrestling?  Yeah,  first girl,  come down here  to do some oil wrestling  with this girl.  We'll get my personal  corn tickets  for tomorrow night.  Great, great seats.  What if I put her  in a front headlock  and snap her neck?  I'll get in there.  I don't want to see you  oil wrestling a chick.  I want to see two chicks  oil wrestling.  No, I understand.  I just want the corn tickets. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah, so if you're a guy  and you want to see corn,  pimp out your girlfriend.  Yeah, bring her down.  First one to make it  to the studio  gets my corn tickets  if you'll oil wrestle.  Yeah.  All right?  You've got to help  the show out.  I think it's time  to call privilege, possibly.  Any of those girls  down there oil wrestling?  I'm so fragile.  I picked that girl  up like a sack of feathers.  We had a great plan today  and only one showed up.  Well, maybe she could  just pleasure herself  while we wait  for the other girl.  Yeah, get her in.  We'll all just circle  around and watch.  Do we have some eggs? 
[02:03:00]  We'll supply the oil.  Do we have some eggs?  Huh?  Oh, some eggs.  Did you ever hear  about our egg shooting show?  No.  That was great.  We have guys come in  because this girl  that could shoot eggs  out of her most  intimate of areas.  We found out about her  because we were talking  about bachelor party.  In the shell  or out of the shell?  In the shell.  In the shell.  So she'd stick them there  and fire them out.  The guys had  wiffle ball bats  and we've taken  batting practice  and just slamming them.  That one high and wide  for ball two.  Yeah.  That veg, 
[02:03:30]  quite the change up.  Didn't she go like  eight feet or something  crazy like that?  We had her propped up  on a table.  Nine feet.  Nine feet.  We had a little football  field and everything.  Yeah, we had yard markers  to see how far she'd shoot.  And then we had a blind guy  with a basket  trying to catch the end.  I was legally blind  if you're shooting it out.  He was using  some type of sonar.  This was before  we met you.  That's got to be  about a year ago.  Last summer already?  Wow.  How time flies.  I know.  We got in a lot of trouble  for that show.  Last night in my apartment  we had Stephen Lynch 
[02:04:00]  and Leona Ness  passing a guitar.  Do you guys know  Leona Ness yet?  Mm-mm.  She's unbelievable.  She's kind of like  the only apple  without the baggage  but that beautiful voice.  Yeah.  She's on MCA.  She just came out now.  They were passing the guitar  back and forth  and she's got the most  beautiful voice  you've ever heard.  Stephen Lynch  is like embarrassed.  She's up in the apartment.  There's like 20 guys  in my apartment  and her and her bass sister there.  I'm like,  come on Lynch,  just lead off a lullaby.  He's doing lullaby  and then we passed  the guitar to her  and she's like, 
[02:04:30]  oh my heart,  why'd you leave me?  It was like  the most amazing,  like everyone was like  just,  for some reason it worked,  like everyone was able  to switch gears.  A little bit of contrast there,  yeah.  It was unbelievable.  She's great.  I should have brought the CD in  because I have a feeling  we're going to have  a lot of time to kill  waiting for the second.  Dennis, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Good.  All right, man.  I tried to,  what are we going to do  about this about a week ago?  Jay, why don't you explain  what are we going to do  about this again?  We're getting new listeners  every day. 
[02:05:00]  I don't know what that is.  You're in the car.  It was your thing, man.  You're in the car.  What are we going to do  about it?  I want to close the deal.  Yeah.  You want to close the deal.  Oh, oh.  You got a girl with you?  No, she's not here.  I took her out from work  last week.  Yeah.  We kind of fooled around  a little bit  and took her out to smoke.  And you hit the dead end.  And we, well,  whipped it out  and said,  what are we going to do  about this?  She just gave me the look  like you're crazy.  Put it away.  She's not going.  It didn't work, man.  Well, then she's not going, man.  That's it.  She thought she was a friend. 
[02:05:30]  Jay, you're the best.  If I was there last week,  I would have kicked that guy  at Billy's ass myself for you.  That's all right.  Thanks.  All right, man.  You rock.  I think she just used you  for your reefer.  Yeah, I'll go out and smoke.  Put that away.  Give me the old bone.  I thought it was going to be close.  We only had about 45 minutes  and I had to get back to work.  Did you start stroking it?  I should have did that.  You got to be like,  look, I got to finish it up myself.  Look what you did to me.  You left me hanging, man.  Well, we didn't talk about it  for like three weeks.  I kind of forgot the steps. 
[02:06:00]  Well, it's all in my pamphlet.  You can get on there.  All right, yeah.  I got to get your book.  I want a section in the book.  Okay, Dennis.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  You guys are the best.  Go see Kevin Pollack,  Ocean Township.  Kevin Pollack tonight.  Yeah, rascals.  Where's Spaz?  We got to get back  into the gay look.  We can't miss this opportunity.  Here he is.  Take that mic over there, Spaz.  Oh, I have a very important  announcement to make.  Uh-oh.  Somebody is on eBay  auctioning off  the Map of Hawaii shirt  that allegedly left my person 
[02:06:30]  during the fight.  Yeah.  It's not the shirt.  It is definitely...  I have the shirt at home.  Okay.  So if anybody's out there  on eBay like looking around  going, oh, I'll buy the shirt.  It's not the shirt.  Not the authentic shirt.  The guy's just got a shirt.  All right.  Let's...  Hold on, Spaz.  Jim.  Jim has a twist on Jay's trick.  What are we going to do about this?  Go ahead, Jim.  It's not...  You don't do...  What are you going to do about this?  You got to say,  look what you're doing to me, baby.  And then you take that hand  and you fart it down.  No.  Wow.  I'm sorry. 
[02:07:00]  Look what you're doing to me, baby.  Well, look what you're doing to me.  It's great.  That sounds good.  But if you're sliding the head or hand,  they get a little freaky  because it reminds them of their uncle.  You're just going to start doing it yourself  and then they're just going to feel stupid  staring at you.  And eventually they'll take over from there.  All right, Jim.  That's good, Jim.  All right.  Well, anyway, thanks a lot, guys.  You suck.  All right.  I like that guys are, you know,  taking what are we going to do about this  and, you know, getting their own...  Making it their own.  Getting their own batting stance out of it. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, they're trying it out.  James, what's up?  You're next on NEW.  Yo, what's going on, guys?  How are you?  Great.  I got to say,  my wife's relative works for NBC.  I used to go to the NBC Saturday Night Live parties  for many times.  And I thought Jay Moore was the most arrogant person  I have ever seen.  Now we have to see him on your show.  I think he's, like, the greatest guy.  Oh, cool.  I got to say, bro.  Why did he come off like a...  Did he come off like an arrogant...  Yeah, well, how did I come off...  Maybe I was just drunk.  Yeah, he was just, like, very pompous.  Like, he was the man.  Like, you know, he was too good to be around you. 
[02:08:00]  But after hearing him on the show,  he's, like, one of the guys.  And I just wanted to say, you know,  good job, guys.  Yeah, I don't get that from Jay at all.  No, I don't get it anymore, man.  I got to say.  I think your first impression was right.  Yeah, we got to be careful.  We can't kiss Jay's ass too much  or we're going to have more comedians  going on in here fighting him.  I'm going to kiss his ass.  I just wanted to say he's a great guy  so far from what I hear of him.  And I got to go see his show next time.  Okay, thank you, Jay.  Thanks, Jay.  Appreciate it.  All right, so in James' defense,  you know, I was drinking pretty heavily back then.  Oh, you are?  So, you know, you're loaded at a table 
[02:08:30]  and you're, like, trying to get some check or something.  And a guy rolls up like,  Hey, Jay Moore.  You're like, yeah, excuse me.  I'm, you know.  I'm working here.  I'm working here.  You've got to put the cones out.  Yeah, and the guy's like,  Screw you.  I just wanted to say hi.  You know, but you got your own MO  so I can see how that could come across that way.  We're still waiting for the first girl to show up.  She gets my corn tickets for tomorrow night.  Great seats.  All you have to do is oil wrestle for a little while.  Hey, how was no doubt with your eye shadow?  Great.  Did you buy beer for, like, 14-year-olds?  Yeah.  Yeah, all of them.  We went over the review earlier. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, you did?  I woke up at 3.  It's okay.  It was very funny.  A bunch of pink hair dye and stuff.  I think I had more pubes on myself  than in the entire room.  You're walking around with a drink  because they sell booze over there,  and you turn around and almost spill it  on a 9-year-old in her PJs  because she's going right to bed  when she's done with the show.  Well, the best is when you go to a show like that  and you actually have, like, a big thing of beer  and then you, like, enter the crowd  and they all start staring at you  like the apes looking at the monolith in 2001.  They just can't believe it. 
[02:09:30]  Like, oh, beer.  Wow, beer.  Beer, beer, Homer.  Beer, beer, beer.  That was great.  Spaz, grab the mic.  Now, Spaz...  I'll take the headset off  so he gets the full...  Well, let me explain.  We had Spaz's week in review  very early in the show today.  I understand.  Riveting.  A lot of people in their cars now.  You missed out on a great week in review.  One of the things Spaz covered  was the gay look and the gay face.  He says Kevin Spacey has...  He believes Kevin Spacey is gay  because he has a gay face. 
[02:10:00]  And a gay look.  Now, you want to explain  the gay look again  before you decide  what Jay Moore is officially.  Yes.  The gay look can either be  a more roundish face  instead of rectangular  and more drawn  or it can be really, really  pushing on the sides  and making the top  in your chin longer.  Wait.  I've got to write that down.  Sides?  Round...  Gay face.  Okay.  So if you have a round face...  I know you were...  I thought that meant you were gay. 
[02:10:30]  I didn't know you had a buttonhole...  It was a face.  I'm sure they dumped out of that.  I asked Kevin Spacey  if he was gay to his face  and he told me no.  Yeah.  I'm sure they dumped out of that  but Jay just gave a very good definition  of what gay is all about.  All right.  So, Spaz.  Yes.  Does Jay have the gay look  and the gay face?  Well, in lieu of everything  I've seen this past week  I'm going to say no.  No, but no, no, no.  Everything aside.  Just the look.  You can look.  You're looking for the gay look 
[02:11:00]  and the gay face.  It shows some tendencies.  My face.  You're bordering on a gay face.  My face has gay tendencies.  Now, Jay, don't beat up Spaz.  We need Spaz.  He gives a...  For what?  He gives a great stop.  We don't even know.  We don't know.  So, what is it about his face?  It's the way it's contorted.  What?  Contorted?  I'm gas.  I've been holding him in.  I'm waiting to crunch 
[02:11:30]  in the Jay Moore sweep.  Is it the forehead?  The cheekbones?  The sucked in look?  The long...  The chin.  The way it's...  The drawn look.  Well, that's because, you know,  I purposely diet and exercise  to get the thin face  to kind of get, like,  more of a chiseled...  Now I sound like a complete face.  Well, you have to do that  to get parts, though.  No, he looks better.  He just looks better on film.  Yeah.  So, it's the drawn.  He's got that drawn thing going.  Drawn?  Drawn. 
[02:12:00]  Like...  Like...  You are completely insane.  You are completely friggin' insane.  I think.  Like a pair.  Like a pair.  It's like a pair.  So, if you have a pair face,  you're gay.  Reverse pair, though.  Reverse pair.  I usually can tell  if a guy's gay by his face  if there's nuts  on the bridge of his nose.  That's pretty much gay.  But I don't know  how you can just look  at somebody.  You can look at somebody  and tell if they're gay.  Right.  But I couldn't explain it.  You just look at a guy  and go,  oh, he's gay. 
[02:12:30]  The Marco rolled in here  as I go.  He's gay.  I don't know if it was  the face or the leather.  Super gay.  I don't know if it was  the face or the leather  underpants.  What a week of radio  we've had.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks to Jay Moore.  You leaving tomorrow, Jay?  No, I'm leaving Wednesday.  I'm taking my father  to opening day Tuesday.  And that'll be the best.  And then Wednesday,  I'm rolling out.  Yeah, outie.  When did you listen?  Tina Cole is at a  counterweight tonight,  so we're all going  to go up and see him.  I'll go.  In his nice middle slot.  Mario Cantone's headlining. 
[02:13:00]  Are you kidding?  The TV gay face?  Yeah.  Yeah, Mario Cantone.  When's the show tonight?  8 and 10.30.  Let's go.  Mike Tina Cole.  I'll go support Mike.  How funny will it be  to yell full-blown AIDS  with a gay headliner?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Steampipe Alley.  You just have that show  Steampipe Alley, man.  That's right.  A kid's show.  That's good.  Anyway, I had a showing  of the Jay Moore fight  at my house last night.  Oh, you edited it?  We have like a...  You look like Steve Sable  from NFL Films. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, it's a two-camera shoot.  We have a...  Four.  We have a 27-minute version  that is just awesome stuff.  Awesome.  All the highlights.  You've got to get a copy  before you go to L.A.  Okay, definitely.  So we're watching.  My brothers are in stitches,  first of all.  And there's so much  behind-the-scenes footage  that I didn't even know  what was going on.  You in the elevator  is classic.  That is some funny stuff.  Where you're like  critiquing your own performance  and stuff.  You're pissed off  that you missed  with that first shot.  You like glance.  The lead, right.  And you're like,  oh, I missed it. 
[02:14:00]  I can't believe it.  And they shadow box  in the elevator and stuff.  I blasted one of these doors  with like as hard as I could.  I think I broke my knuckle.  It's classic  because I didn't know  that was going on.  Is that on the tape?  No, but the elevator stuff  is great  because you are so hyped up  and you're pissed off  that you missed  with the lead, right?  And you're like,  damn, I should have hooked him.  And then you're like  shadow boxing and stuff.  How do I look shadow boxing?  Gay or did I look straight?  No, I wouldn't want  to mess with you.  When did you stop drinking?  May 5th, two years ago.  And what huge event  prompted that? 
[02:14:30]  I realized once I had one,  that's it.  It's all over.  But there wasn't  one single event?  No, I never did.  Most people have  some kind of a thing  that I haven't.  No, I was never...  That's it.  I never was crazy.  I never like...  I never like crapped my pants.  I never...  I just...  I don't understand  the concept  of like having two beers.  I just don't even...  Even now,  I just don't understand.  It doesn't taste good.  It's not like...  It's either 20 or not.  Yeah, you drink  to get loaded.  Like, let's get bummed.  That's how I look at it.  You can't be happy though  with like just a slight buzz 
[02:15:00]  and nurse that through you.  No, because once I get the buzz,  I want to keep going.  Like, let's keep this buzz rolling.  Let's keep it going.  One of those shots?  Light them up.  Yeah.  Light them up, Dorton.  Light them up.  Chalk them up.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  Clear the field.  Clear the field.  Clear the field.  Grape juice.  That was a great...  That was a good one.  You got the pitch pipe?  That was amazing.  You remember that honey moon?  That was great, man.  What was it?  It was grape juice.  Grape juice.  They thought they were drinking wine 
[02:15:30]  and they got fake drunk.  I had some head this morning, love.  So did I.  Thank God there was cold grape juice  in the fridge.  All right.  Yeah.  We got to take a break.  So what happened to the other girl  that was going to wrestle?  Is she stuck in traffic or...  Well, where's the other girl?  Can we take a look at her?  Velvet.  Maybe she could just rub oil on herself.  That's a fine sister.  That would be fun.  That's one sister right there.  That's a sister?  Mm-hmm.  Sister.  A-H.  Sister. 
[02:16:00]  Velvet.  Velvet.  Sister.  Her name's Velvet.  Wow, Velvet.  What's up?  Hey, Velvet.  That's a sister right there, baby.  How you doing?  Yeah.  So you're one of the oil wrestlers?  Yes.  Hmm.  I am.  We saw you in one of the magazines, in Portfolio.  Yeah, what magazine's that?  Let me see.  Portfolio.  Let me see that.  How come you didn't get in on the Tretch photo shoot?  Let me see her spread.  Oh, it does.  And her photo shoot.  I'm already in it with my girlfriend, so what's the sense of hugging off the whole book?  You know what I mean?  Holy smokes.  Wow, huh? 
[02:16:30]  Let me see.  Look at that.  You are sexy.  She's got an appliance, and then she's got...  Whoa.  There's a photo shoot of a girl laying on a bearskin rug, and then halfway through the photo shoot,  the bearskin rug is, like, attacking her vagina.  Let's do another thing.  Let me see, huh?  Let me get passing it around.  I love that you're comfortable with guys just passing naked photos of you around.  That's not the only time anybody see me naked.  Look at that.  That looks sexy.  She's got her butt all perched up there.  It's an ice cream scooper, I'll tell you that.  Yeah, and then the other girl's got a...  That's why brothers drive Cadillacs, because you can't stick that ass in a Volkswagen. 
[02:17:00]  You've got to treat that ass right.  Oh, my God.  You've got a nice big Lincoln for that ass.  That's too sweet.  Look at what this chick's doing to you in here.  Yeah, but that other chick, it's got nothing on velvet.  Velvet's harder than that.  Well, look, she's tossing her salad.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, yeah.  It's my girl Velvet.  Let me take a look here.  Velvet, huh?  If you like that, I'm going to be in the same book next month.  I'm going to be on the cover.  Oh, yeah?  Do you get like a commission if more people buy that issue than other issues? 
[02:17:30]  Do you get a cut of any of that money?  Not by money.  They just want me to take their pictures.  Wow, look at that purple winged bat.  Purple winged bat.  Is that a euphemism for vagina?  Yes.  No, it's a prop she's using in the photo shoot.  So, Velvet, what happened to your wrestling partner?  Stuck in photos.  We all have photos to do.  I was first, so I got out first.  I'd like to get you out first.  Wow.  You ever do any movies?  Yes, I have 4.0 movies out. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, yeah?  What are some of the fun titles we can look for you in?  They're all in Caesar video.  No, I mean like what are the titles of the movies?  Oh, like Sensuous Woman, Sexy Dancer, 5, 6, 7, 8.  Whoa.  What's that mean, 5, 6, 7, 8?  Volume.  Volume.  Oh, volume's 5, 6, 7, 8.  I apologize.  All right.  So what's wrong with Caesar video that they only hooked up with Velvet in episode 5?  I mean, I'm sitting next to you.  I'd have you in episode negative 6.  Is it like Star Wars where there's a prequel that's going to come out to answer some of the unambiguous questions? 
[02:18:30]  That's a big word, Anthony.  Come on.  Let's keep it nice.  Nice and simple.  All right, Jack.  So listen to me.  So you got four videos.  Caesar video.  Yes.  All right.  And everybody can look at Velvet in Caesar video.  Now, do you guys use condoms?  Because I hate when people use condoms and pornos.  No.  No.  That's what I hate.  I hate when you're in a porno, you want to get your jerk going.  It's fantasy world.  And you're masturbating and you're looking at people that are germ conscious. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I don't want to worry about you getting sick.  You know, what, are you afraid of germs?  You're a porn star.  No, we kind of take care of the germ part beforehand.  You get tested and everything.  You do your thing.  Sometimes you're masturbating and they're all wearing condoms.  I want dirty people having dirty sex.  Right.  Dirty is a guest.  I want a guy with lupus having sex with a chick with half a leg in an alley and he pulls out and wipes it on the curb.  And then she throws up.  And then she throws up.  You're even shocking Velvet there, Jay. 
[02:19:30]  I'm not that good looking, Velvet, so I can't be shy.  Be careful.  We don't want to play the Van Halen record again.  No way.  We're running out of delight.  This just in.  Challenger for Velvet on the way from Privilege.  Oh, really?  We have a challenger for you, Velvet.  Really?  You do these a lot?  You do the oil wrestling a lot?  We just kind of started this, but would you feel the person that's coming to wrestle me, I'm not China.  Yeah, so don't get that idea. 
[02:20:00]  It's more of an erotic type situation.  Oh, good, good.  Because we're so down.  Yeah, we don't want any more.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We're at a dump.  We're at a dump.  We're losing the show again.  All right.  You make a lot of money doing the videos.  What do you like doing more, the videos, photo shoots, or the wrestling?  The photo shoots.  I believe Velvet wants to touch some poontang is what she was getting at.  That's what it calls for.  What about penises?  What about them?  Love them.  The only made one, mine is the only one they made in white. 
[02:20:30]  That's all right.  Because I'm an honorary member, you know, I'm a brother from the waist down.  Oh, yeah.  Cassie?  Yeah, but if me and you do, we have to wear a condom, though.  Now the condom has to be.  No, because I'm married.  My wife, they can smell it.  I didn't want to do anything.  I just wanted to see it.  No, I want to do it.  If I take my junk out, it's got to go someplace.  Jay, show Velvet your junk.  Let me see your ass.  Let me see that beautiful.  You want to see my ass? 
[02:21:00]  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  I'm taking it out right now.  That looks like a double scoop of Haagen-Dazs chocolate.  Woo!  Look at the tattoos on you.  Oh, my tattoos?  What's that, the crying Indian from the litter commercial?  Oh, it's a horse.  It looks like an Indian, like with the...  Oh, yeah, it's a stallion.  Man, that's a stallion.  It symbolates the strength.  You want to know?  Symbolates the strength?  Yeah.  You guys...  What does symbolate mean? 
[02:21:30]  Symbolize, symbolize, symbolize.  Oh, okay.  You've got an ass like one of those, like the 100-meter dash ladies.  Addy.  Oh, yeah.  You could put a drink on that ass.  Like Flo-Jo.  Flo-Jo in the studio.  Oh, God, there's nothing like a nice big ass.  There's nothing...  See, you tell a white girl, like, you got a nice big ass, they're like, big.  Yeah, they got all big.  I wouldn't say big if I meant it in a bad way, you moron.  Yeah.  I mean, something I can put my face into, park a bike in. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  More cushion for the push-in.  That's right, baby.  Now, Jay, show velvet to Joe.  It's soft now.  I got it.  Let me get it.  Let me get it.  Oh, my God.  It's soft.  It's soft.  You see how he backed out?  No, no, look.  No, hey, they know me.  I don't back out of anything.  Listen, it's a grower, not a shower.  We got to tell that story.  Hey, we got to tell that story.  Which one?  The one we've never told on the radio.  My penis is a grower, not a shower.  So when it's soft, it looks like a rock.  Show me one.  Oh, wait till... 
[02:22:30]  Okay, we'll wait.  Another month, we can tell a great story.  Does it involve me?  No.  No, no.  It's pretty funny.  If I'm soft, it just looks like an acorn.  Yeah, yeah.  It's an elephant with a bad haircut.  I'm trying to think where I stole that from.  I know.  You better be careful.  You stole that, Jay!  Hope, if you were a comic, you'd know that.  If you were a comic, Opie!  I can do impressions, see?  The angry Paul.  I got to smile at him.  Speaking of the fight, Rick is working his you-know-what off in the other studio. 
[02:23:00]  He's going to have elevator and outside audio from the fight available in a few minutes.  Okay, good.  Never before heard audio from the elevator.  I, in review, Velvet, you sexy sister.  Oh, God, what I could do to you.  I'm the only guy in this building that can handle you, you know that?  Really, man?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  You can't get it, honey.  Yeah, I'll agree with you.  You scare the hell out of me.  No, I'm scared of you.  Now, see, I'm the type of person that takes a challenge, so, uh... 
[02:23:30]  Uh-oh.  Woo!  Can you do that ass dance, you know?  Yeah, get in the corner, baby.  It's not called the Jay Moore Sweep for nothing.  Like, you bend over and shake that ass, and it goes in circles and stuff.  Oh, God, it's amazing.  Where's my...  I love...  All white girls just...  I like big butts, and I cannot lie.  Every white girl should just kill themselves right now.  Look at that.  All right, watch the ass move.  We're getting big butts.  Oh, God.  Hold on.  Let me get you some music here.  All right, here we go.  You know, I was gonna...  I like big butts. 
[02:24:00]  Get the headphones on there, Justin.  That's Elvis.  I like big butts.  Oh, my God.  Look at her move that ass.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Whoa!  It's too hoppity-hop.  Wow.  Too hoppity-hop.  I can shake that.  But I'm not a comic, Jay, so don't laugh.  Wait a minute.  I can't lie.  Oh, God.  Hey, do that move again. 
[02:24:30]  That butt move.  Do it for Jay.  Drop the drawers.  Yeah, do it for Jay.  Do it for Jay.  Yeah, let's see that ass.  He sets his...  Oh, God.  Look at that.  Oh, she's shaking like a car on bad gas.  Woo!  Honey.  Oh, God.  See, if I had sex with Velvet, I'd last two seconds.  Because she'd clench up her ass and just pull me in.  That'd be all over, man.  No, it wouldn't.  I'd just get him back up and we'd do it again.  Look at that.  Oh, Velvet, rascals south in Ocean Township. 
[02:25:00]  Velvet, we've been rascals in Ocean Township.  Velvet, peep lad.  No way.  I hate that.  Velvet's doing videos, baby.  She sees it.  She don't need that garbage money.  Have you done the pee plan stuff?  No.  No, she's classy, man.  So do you do it in all the places in the films?  Do you do anal?  Do you do anal?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You get extra cash for that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  No doubt.  Never do DP?  Extra pleasure, too.  Oh.  Double penetration?  Never tried that one yet, but you could do the first if you want. 
[02:25:30]  Wow, she's really into you, though.  She knows.  I'm not afraid of her.  Show the joke, man.  Show the joke.  I've got to get it going.  I will show it, but I'm not going to show it soft because it's stupid looking.  Oh, man.  Maybe she can get it for me.  Without the cameras.  My mom and dad.  This will be the one day my mom and dad are listening.  I just hope your aunt's not listening.  She doesn't like our show.  My aunt loves it.  My dad.  We met Jay Zan, and she was horrified.  Aunt Sally.  Aunt Sally.  I gave her all the rascals' money to her. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  Oh, really?  And she calls me every time she spends.  She goes, I got my teeth whitened.  I go, how much was that?  She goes, $150.  I'm like, what are you going to spend?  Spend some money, honey.  Yeah, exactly.  My dad listens to you guys, like, religiously now.  He switched over from, like, Rush Limbaugh.  Oh, cool.  But he won't refer to you guys as anything.  He'll go, yeah, I was listening to the fight on that stupid Opie and Anthony show.  Never the Opie and Anthony show.  That stupid Opie and Anthony show.  Like, he can't give in.  Like, upper class, you know, Republican, white guy. 
[02:26:30]  He just can't.  He won't cave in and just say that he loves the show.  We'll get him, too.  It takes time.  No, he listens every day.  I know.  But he'll admit it.  They all admit it.  It does take time.  Trust me, that's my dad's way of admitting it.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was watching your stupid Yankees.  Man, she is eyeing you, yo.  We're like Invasion of the Body Snatchers this show.  I'm trying to get it going.  Jesus.  Don't look.  I'm not looking.  I'm turning my head.  How do you know I'm not just scratching my stomach?  Is he showing you? 
[02:27:00]  No, I'm not going to show it.  I'm not going to show it to all later up.  Yeah?  Well, give her, like, a sneak preview, yo.  It's yo.  All of a sudden, he's Bernie Mac.  It's soft now.  We're in a camera.  Get the camera off.  Dude, we went through that one all the time.  Hey, were you stupid?  Look at it.  You've got the internet behind you.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  You guys are such idiots.  Well, let me explain.  Jay's ready to pull out. 
[02:27:30]  I'm going to get water.  You explain.  All right.  Jay's ready to pull out.  I'm going to get water.  Jay's ready to pull out his junk.  And we had a problem last time with cameras and stuff.  So what does our crew do?  One runs in with a video camera.  We have the spaz cam that a million people are checking out right now.  And Ben's got the digital camera.  You idiots.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  All right.  We've got Velvet's Challenger on the way.  We've got audio from the Jay Moore fat guy fight. 
[02:28:00]  Never before heard audio of the fight.  Yeah.  We've got some elevator footage.  And what else are we doing today?  Blah, blah.  There was something else, but I can't remember at this moment in time.  I can't remember.  All right.  We'll figure it out.  Stay there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you kidding me?  No, I'm not kidding.  Oh, my God.  Let's just put it this way.  Giddy up.  Giddy up, right.  Where's...  Anyway, there's no describing what is going on.  Just use your imagination.  Giddy up.  In Studio 2. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Oh, my dear, sweet Jesus.  What the hell is that man doing?  That's why I was laughing, because it was obvious that Jay was ready to meet Velvet, let's just say.  I know.  Shut up.  We can't say it on the radio.  What is in shock coming into the studio?  All right, Ed.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Dude, I don't need to see that.  I don't need...  I don't need to see that.  Oh, my God.  All right.  We're in the middle of commercials. 
[02:29:30]  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony  It's a Kevlar kind of day  1027 WN  Some kind of body armor  We're just all dumbfounded at this point  I didn't want to turn around  And look into the other studio  During the podcast commercial  Because I'm a professional  I wanted to  Professional radio broadcaster

These guys are not always going to be around.  I think they're protecting you, pal.  How many guys are running?  None, because they know you're sitting there.  Come on over.  Get around them.

Yeah, I know. That can't happen.  You know I did not let me go.  We're not going to get sued.  Why don't you come into the pile?  I just came out of the building to come smack you around.  Just words. 
[03:10:00]  You're acting like I'm talking.  I've got four gorillas holding me.  Yeah, I'm a puppet.  I just came out.  I'm up on the judges' cards, pal.  I just landed six shots.  I just landed six shots, I'm up.  All these people saw me come out to take you.  That's right.  All these people saw it.  We got people here that saw it that came out.  All right, I'll see you tonight then.  See you tonight.  When none of these guys are here, I'll see you tonight. 
[03:10:30]  Is it a deal?  Yeah, it's a $25 ticket.  Is it a deal?  I'll see you tonight.  It's a ticket deal, brother.  I'm going inside.  I'm back.  Body shots.  Six to the body.  I'm thinking, what the hell am I doing?  He's fat.  I got a heart.  Hey, Jay, what are you doing?  I had a desirable going.  It's too bad. 
[03:11:00]  They don't work on my guns.  You know what?  I totally f***ed up that first shot.  That f***ing lead right.  I should f***ing you.  Hey, f***ing.  I thought that f***ing shot up.  Go. Go. Go.  You're okay.  I went out and threw the first punch and I f***ing missed like an idiot.  It's time to go to fight.  People f***ing wreck us a part of.  Jay.  Jay, I got a respect for your foul.  Huh?  I can't do it tonight. 
[03:11:30]  Yo, and I f***ing.  I think f***ing.  That's f***ing bullshit.  People come out of here.  Informally people.  I say I f***ing steal.  When I got f***ing three hours of f***ing materials.  That's f***ing push, man.  And that f***ing down there.  There's f***ing 200 people down there.  And he's going, Jay, you're a pussy.  Why won't you find me?  Because I was f***ing holding us a part.  You go in the air and f***ing steal my f***ing sh**.  F***ing you, Paul.  Why am I still here?  Kind of hard to hear, but I think you get the gist of what was going on down there, huh? 
[03:12:00]  Every time we got in grappling position, people just swarmed down and pulled us apart.  Yeah.  Jay, let me ask you something.  Are you right-handed?  Yeah, but...  Okay, what you do is always lead with that left.  I know.  Until you pop them straight in the face.  I know, I'm right-handed.  With a big guy like that, man, you got to take them down and take them down quick.  Now, you know what my problem is?  I'm right-handed, but I learned to ride a skateboard lefty.  So when I stand...  No, I'm serious.  So I stand, it's like a southpaw, even though I'm right-handed. 
[03:12:30]  So I lead with my right, even though I have no power with my left.  So I just came out and threw a lead right.  Bang.  Switch.  The guy...  Somebody said he dropped a Twinkie.  That's why he moves.  I grazed it up.  But then when I saw it on the video, something hit him right in the forehead.  Man.  Man, if you got to catch a guy...  The guy's got a big forehead, no doubt.  Big face.  Big face.  Big dude.  How much do you weigh?  350?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to catch him open-handed so you don't break your hands.  Gotta watch that, Chief.  Yeah, you need those hands for, you know, what you were doing back there.  I need my hands for pimping. 
[03:13:00]  You got a strong pimp?  Pimp hand!  Pimp hand!  Yeah.  Pimp hand!  What did you just ask that again to Anthony and Opie?  What'd I say?  You asked me if I had what?  Strong pimp hand.  Pimp hand!  Pimp hand!  You stole that!  We had two strippers in here that were cousins.  And they're like, well, we're not going to get naked at the same time.  I'm like, come on, don't be a bitch, you know, come on.  And they're stripping for me at the same time.  We look up, they're making out.  A few cousins are making out.  That rock. 
[03:13:30]  That rock, yeah.  That rock, yeah.  That was nuts.  Were they doing that for you?  Were they doing that for themselves, or what?  I think it was a little of both.  There you go.  A little for everyone.  And they were like 18 years old.  I'm gonna bring it up.  I'm gonna bring it up.  Pimp hand!  You stole it!  O.D., what up?  What up, my man?  How are you?  Yo, it's gonna roll up today, yo.  Yeah, my man Jay Moore!  You suck, son.  What is that?  Let me find out.  You desecrated the...  No, you blessed the Jay Moore studio with the essence.

Yeah, now she changed.  Smell it all pretty.  Little yellow fishnet outfits.  She got that cross on.  I think that's what Jesus was hoping for when he was being crucified.  No, I'm being serious, right?  If you're gonna come back, the second coming, let's put it right in that cleave. 
[03:14:30]  You liking the show today, O.D.?  Yo, boy, it's been an awesome week, kid.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun.  Oh, sweet.  You were here when Anna Ma was here, but I got velvet.

Ready to go.  With it.  With it.  Listen to that voice.  With it.  She was with it.  I said, ha, man, what's up with that?  Yo, O.D. 
[03:15:00]  O.D., my man.  Talk to him, Velvet.  O.D., Earl of Pearl was down for the count.  Oh, man.  Earl...  Earl flaked in front of like...  Everybody.  In front of the whole city of New York.  Yeah, he flaked all right.  Oh, my man.  He's gay.  I know.  He couldn't even look her in the eye.  Nah.  I can't show his face in this town again.  He's done.  He's washed up.  The wrist was broke.  Yup.  The wrist was broke.  Yo, Velvet, you pushed that big...  Pushed that big caboose up in his grill and he ain't do nothing?  And then some.  And then some. 
[03:15:30]  And then some, baby.  I couldn't understand it.  Now, if I pushed my big caboose up in your face, what would you do?  Damn, baby.  I would have been skiing my tongue.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, thank God his phone screwed up.  Thank God his phone screwed up.  He dumped himself.  No.  No.  Not even Jay's...  Not even the influence of the pimp hand couldn't get this man to do anything?  No.  Well, my pimp hand don't work on men.  Oh, that's cool.  Don't say that.  Don't say that to Marco.  Hey!  Only on Marco, right?  Hey!  O.D., I even put a shout out to you today. 
[03:16:00]  I said, if O.D. was here, forget it.  Yeah, hey, baby.  Thanks for the support, man.  I don't represent you, son.  Damn, son.  What are you rolling at now?  I thought they had an imposter up there today.  I'm hearing the radio.  I said, who's that?  I said, oh, that's Jay.  You know that.  Well, man, you got it down pat, kid.  All you got to do is get a little tan on your white ass.  You'll be ready to come.  No doubt.  No doubt.  You know how we do it?  All right, man.  How far away are you from the studio? 
[03:16:30]  Where are you right now?  I'm in Queens, B.  It would take me like half an hour to get out there.  Yeah.  I think it'd be worth it, baby.  I think I'll wait for you.  You think so?  Nah, we're going to be out soon.  We're going to be out soon.  You're going to be out, man.  Yeah, turn on the old computer.  We got a little spaz cam happening.  Yo, I got my jammy hooked up and everything, son.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm connected.  All right.  What are you doing tonight, O.D.?  Me not as kid.  And you want to find out if you're gay?  Spaz knows.  He's got this new power.  Hey, Spaz.  Amazing.  Spaz is just going to say all black guys are not gay. 
[03:17:00]  Yo, my man Spaz is crazy, bro.  What can you do without this guy, bro?  Did you hear the Week in Review today?  Yes, I did.  Priceless, man.  Richard Cunningham had very sniff of blue.  A valuable potpourri of misinformation, bro.  Yeah.  Well, Spaz, you've seen Old Dirty a lot.  He's been in the studio many, many times.  So you have that image of his face in your mind right now, right?  Yes.  Big baby Jesus.  You say that gay people have the gay face and the gay look?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Spaz is Old Dirty gay. 
[03:17:30]  I'm sorry, Old D.  Yes.  Not white.  Yo, I'm going to play with you when I see you, Spaz.  That's it.  O.D. has the gay face?  I got the gay face?  Now, what makes it the gay face there, Spazzy?  It's kind of slender, and plus he shows some tendencies from time to time.  Not as much as Earl, but from time to time.  We're not going with tendencies.  You said just by looking at somebody, you can tell.  Just by the face.  He's got the pushed-in face on the sides.  He's half boxer.  Yo, Velvet.  Yes.  You think a weekend at your retreat could kill me of this illness? 
[03:18:00]  I will be definitely, definitely back from wherever Spaz just put you in.  Definitely.  Definitely.  Oh, V. I'm looking at her ass right now, and I'm telling you, V.  Is it like cinnamon?  Cinnamon?  No.  It's like...  I can't even explain it.  It's like two hoppity hops.  We said it earlier.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You know Janet Jack me's ass?  Yeah.  Well, just bury that under your front porch, because you've got a new one now. 
[03:18:30]  What?  This is the new ass in town.  Yup.  And we've got the hot redhead from Privilege Emma, the hottest girl in the entire place  of Privilege Emma's going to wrestle with Velvet.  A sensual wrestle, not a...  You're oiling up and everything with the 10W40?  Has Emma seen Velvet yet?  I hope she's been walking back and forth.  She's seen me.  Is she all cool with it?  Yeah, she's cool.  Isn't she pretty?  Yeah, she's nice.  She's kind of petrified, but she's nice.  That's kind of petrified.  Great.  I ain't afraid to you.  Oh, don't beat that ass, Velvet.  She is. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, no.  This is all love.  I'm not afraid to you.  Yo, get the festivities going.  The people want to hear this oil wrestling thing.  Alright.  Alright, baby.  Later.  Peace, Nick.  Peace, baby.  Actually, they're ready to go out there.  Alright.  We just need a microphone and we're...  Yeah, get a mic hook up.  They're getting a couple mic hook ups.  God, you're hot!  Jesus Christ!  Every time she turns around, it's like a new sunshine.  It's like you never get tired of it.  It's like I forget and then every time she turns around, it's like... 
[03:19:30]  God, bang!  Look at my ass, white man!  White man!  Be easy on himself.  What a way to end a week of radio.  Alright, we're getting the mics hooked up for out there.  How many mics we got?  We need two, yeah.  I'm coming in Monday and I'm bringing everybody champagne.  Oh, you're not allowed to have a non-alcoholic champagne.  Yeah, sure.  What do you think?  We'll dump some vodka in there and everything will be cool.  We're in.  Get the non-alcoholic champagne.  We'll call them champagne.  Are you guys not allowed to drink in the studio?  Just grab them?  Yeah.  Our bosses aren't here.  Yeah, three mics.  Let's go. 
[03:20:00]  I'm bringing Corbell.  What about Seth?  Alright, let's go.  Alright.  The next four nights when I pleasure myself are going to be to that ass.  Spaz, is this mic on?  Put on my headphones, you dumb F.  There he goes.  Okay.  Jay, grab a mic.  I got a...  We only have a few minutes left in the show here.  Sure, it's pink.  Alright, where's the spaz cam?  Where's the spaz cam?  Where's the wrestling match?  I guess Big Kev's got the spaz cam.  The blue tarp is set up outside the studio. 
[03:20:30]  Oh.  If you're going to be, if you're too late, I'm not locking the door.  Jay is out here.  Jay was holding my mic.  Oh, I got it in my hand.  I'm going to have to wash up.  Alright, I think we're ready, ladies.  We don't need Jay.  You don't need Jay.  Yeah, right?  We got the lovely velvet in a yellow fishnet number.  We got Big Kev on the spaz cam.  He'll be getting some fine shots.  And Emma, right?  Hi. 
[03:21:00]  I remember Emma.  How are you?  With the Opie and Anthony t-shirt.  I think that's real high, man.  From Privilege, of course.  You can see her dancing down there.  On the blue tarp, right now.  Now, what's the, wow, those clothes are going to get very oily, aren't they, Opie?  Well, I think they're ready to take the clothes off, aren't they?  Alright, velvet is taking the baby oil.  Wow.  It's like an Oreo cookie on the blue tarp.  Can we pretend we're in some other place? 
[03:21:30]  Yes, you can.  Blue screen photography like Lucasfilm uses in the superimposed spaceships.  Give Emma the mic.  You seem a little nervous.  Are we going to have some CGI effects, sir?  Yeah, we could have.  Yeah.  Are you a little nervous?  A little bit nervous.  A little worried about velvet.  Why is that?  Yeah, she looks tough.  She looks tough.  Well, it's sensual wrestling.  It's not like combative wrestling.  Right.  It's more like a mutual body massage.  It's not very tough.  Yeah, yeah.  I see that.  You don't have to worry about it.  Hey, Jade, this is what it's all about here. 
[03:22:00]  Why can't Reverend Al Sharpton be here and see how the races get together in a good way?  See?  Right?  Malakum Shalom.  And they say the brothers don't like us.  Come on.  And he's a Knick fan, too.  It's all real.  It's all real.  It's not where the butts are real.  He's a Knick fan.  And neither are you.  Did someone bring you a butts cap?  Did someone bring you a one-night?  Oh, they're good.  All right, how are we starting the wrestling?  There they go.  Who gets to go on top?  The last time Emma was here, she had a mohawk and she's informed us since then that she's 
[03:22:30]  bald.  Vince McMahon, eat your heart out.  Wow.  This is what they should be doing, WWF.  All right, they're pouring the oil all over each other.  Big Kev is getting some stuff on the spaz cam.  Oh, my God.  Earl, don't talk to me there.  Jay's right in front of the action there.  Jay?  Let's go to you.  There's a doggy style position going on.  Yeah.  Chocolates in the back, vanillas in the front.  But I got a feeling that might change if we play our cards right.  Okay, terrific. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, no.  Emma is...  Plenty of oil.  ...against velvet...  Look at those Hershey Kisses.  There's plenty of oil now on the blue tarp, on the girls.  You guys getting slippery?  They're rubbing it in.  Here, let's go to the mic on the blue tarp.  Yeah, I'll just get some...  Let's, uh...  All right, they are...  Let's go down to the field with O.J. Simpson on the sidelines.  I believe it's amazing. 
[03:23:30]  When does someone slit her throat?  All right, there's oil all over the blue tarp.  What are the bottoms?  Wow!  Look at that.  Yeah, for some reason there's bottoms on.  Let's get some noise going.  We got the field mic working.  It's slippery and...  Wow.  It's very sensual.  That's something, huh?  Lots of wood.  Look.  You guys having fun?  Yeah.  We'll see you over here.  Look at the contrast.  We didn't even need a color camera for this. 
[03:24:00]  We could have just been a black and white camera.  It would look the same.  It's great.  It's like a negative.  Let's drop the bottoms is what Jay's yelling.  Emma, take off her bottoms.  Emma, take off her bottoms.  No, she'll let you.  Yeah, take off her bottoms.  Yeah, take off her bottoms so we can see the...  She'll let you.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  The purple winged bat.  Twist an ankle.  That would be bad.  Oh, it would be like that movie.  If one of these girls slips and breaks their necks and we got to move them out of here 
[03:24:30]  without anyone knowing.  Just toss them down the elevator shaft.  Look at that ass.  Okay.  And Velvet's...  Okay, terrific.  That's a nice triangle, Velvet.  That's like the putting green at the Masters.  Tom Lehman did something on Twitter that I'm putting green.  Oh, my God.  Use that ass, Emma.  Come on.  Don't be afraid of it.  I'm going in.  Look out.  It's not a witch.  Let the record state...  I can't get oily again.  Jay's not in there. 
[03:25:00]  Wow.  Lots of slimy action on the blue tarp, Opie.  I see that.  Yes.  And we're getting some great picks on the spaz camp.  Whoa.  What's going on here?  Wait.  Get the mic back on the field.  There may be some spanking going on.  A little spanking going on.  Come on.  Spank her harder.  200 years of oppression.  Come on.  Let her rip. 
[03:25:30]  Meow.  Meow.  Uh...  Emma, why don't you spank Velvet's ass there?  Yes.  Watch this...  There you go.  Watch this thing move.  Uh-oh.  Look at it move.  It's like an earthquake.  Watch this.  There's oil on it.  Oh, she got loud.  God, Jay.  We are so far from the button.  It's ridiculous.  Elvis is here?  What?  I can't even speak. 
[03:26:00]  I'm so horny.  Velvet's trembling.  She's like,  He's like, come on, white girl, hit that ass if you mean it.  Hit me, hit me.  All right, Kev, kick that camera still so the people at home get a little peek at what's going on here on the Blue Tarp Cabaret.  Emma's working that butt.  Whoa, here comes some baby oil.  Oh, lots of oil now, lots of oil.  Ton of oil.  Emma taking control.  We have the perfect ass and the perfect breasts.  Like drizzling stuff on a Bundt cake. 
[03:26:30]  I said Bundt cake.  There you go.  Wow, look at all that oil.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  You know, I think we could all get in there now.  That is oiled up really well.  We can put Earl's head in there.  Well, that's quite a scene there, yes.  Looks like the Exxon Valdez crashed into our ass.  Again. 
[03:27:00]  Let's get a field, Mike.  Velvet, how do you feel?  Is it fun?  Oh, yes.  Very oily.  Ooh, Velvet.  Okay, take it easy.  Velvet, is this your first time wrestling a white girl?  No.  No?  No.  You don't care who you wrestle.  You don't care who you wrestle, do you?  No.  It's my first.  She puts milk.  Anybody.  She puts milk in her coffee.  That's a good line, bro.  Oh, my God.  Will you help? 
[03:27:30]  If Velvet brings a toy out, will you help her with it?  Oh, sure.  Oh, get the toy.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wait, just for the record.  Jay, you're using your pimp hands.  There's 11 guys here.  I'm the first one that's daughter of the toy.  Look at that.  He's running for the toy.  You know Otto and George daughter of the toy first, Jay.  Look at that ass.  Oh, my.  Oh, my God.  I think we could get some human oil.  30 weight.  Some human oil.  Not to use it all in the ass.  There's more oil.  You got some WD-40 in the spray can. 
[03:28:00]  There you go.  I don't know.  Maybe some 40 weight.  Get some Armor.  Get some Armor All.  Armor All.  Put some Armor All on those tires.  Look at that.  Oh, my God.  O.P., if you can see the view I have from my vantage point high above the  blue tarp.  Wow, look at that.  Oh, my God.  That does look like a bat.  Last time I saw that view, I had just paid a toll, and I passed a squeegee guy. 
[03:28:30]  Where's the toy?  Let's go.  Where'd it go?  Oh, it's in there already.  Earl's using it.  Earl's using it.  There you go.  That's pretty funny.  Where'd it go?  Well, in lieu of a toy, we'll use the waste paper basket.  Here you go.  I'm going to make a fist.  No clap.  Where'd the hell the toy go?  Where'd the toy go when you turned your clothes? 
[03:29:00]  It was in the other.  Was it in the other studio?  Hmm.  She had to have beer.  Wow.  How are the reviews coming in from the Spaz Cam?  Reviews for the Spaz Cam coming in stinky?  Are people digging it?  Liking it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very good.  All right.  They found the so-called toy.  Okay.  Look, we got our camera guy.  Emma just said, oh, my God. 
[03:29:30]  Francis Ford, copulate.  Oh, there's the toy.  There it is, Emma.  What do you think?  Look at her.  What do I do with you?  She's looking at her like, what do I do with it?  I didn't even figure it out.  What do I do?  Here we go.  This is definitely a curse for me.  You started like a lawnmower, okay?  Oh, my God.  Just punch it in there.  Punch it.  See how we get it started.  Yeah, let's get it started. 
[03:30:00]  This is great.  Roll over so we get a better view there, Velvet.  Actually, but when we roll over, we lose.  Oh, God.  We need this talk to be on that thing like Westbury Music Fair in the round where they just spin.  Help her out.  And she's like a kid trying to figure out which block goes where.  I've got to get a better view of you.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, we obviously can't describe what we're seeing right now.  There it goes.  Well, they're just playing. 
[03:30:30]  Wait, I think Emma wanted to say, okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  All right.  Emma, give us an okay, terrific.  Oh, oh, she's pointing it at you.  Yeah, I see that.  It was winking at me.  Hey, Velvet, will you do that on your back?  Oh, yep.  That would be great.  I'm going to make Rob a liquor store.  Go ahead, Emma.  I'm going to do it.  Oh, okay.  Give Emma the mic.  You said the mic, right?  All right.  I'm going in for the kill.  I'm going in for what you're doing. 
[03:31:00]  No, no.  I am pushing out.  No, no, no.  You can't describe to anybody what we're doing.  Just say you're having fun.  That's all.  Yeah.  It looks like you're basting a turkey.  Family fun.  Yeah, the Manson family.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you, Velvet.  Wow.  Emma completely hard.  Ebony and ivory.  Me?  Whoa.  Was that the placenta? 
[03:31:30]  Sorry.  Shut up.  Wow.  With all that oil, that thing can reach the speed of sound when it comes to that.  All right.  With that, let's hear it for Velvet and Emma.  Yeah.  Great job.  The people.  What a show.  It's, what is it, 69menow.net.  Oh, my God.  Velvet and Emma, of course, is the hottest chick at Privilege, the Premier Gentleman's Club.  All right.  We're back in the studio. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, my God.  We only have a few minutes left in the show.  That was one horrified white chick.  At one point, she wanted to say, okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  All right.  Well, that was one for our Internet friends.  A lot of people taking it out on the spaz cam.  Well, I'm going to have to see if there's some responses to this.  Yeah, we'll go to the phones while you get the instant feedback going.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening?  This is Joe Stanton from Oakland.  I'm watching this.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, it looks like a swimming pool with two split-faced hair sharks just swimming around. 
[03:32:30]  Split-faced hair sharks?  Split-faced hair sharks.  You never heard that before?  Well, they're beautiful.  It's beautiful.  It's a beautiful thing.  I love it.  That's a great thing.  Great job.  Great hair sharks, Hopi.  All right.  Thank you.  The amazing thing about this is you guys can all go see Emma, like, tonight at Privilege  and be like, just walk in the door, pay your cover at Privilege, check your coat and go,  where's Emma?  Where's Emma?  This is Jacques Cousteau. 
[03:33:00]  We are looking for this split-faced hair shark.  I will now send my son into the depths to find this split-faced hair shark.  While I wait on the boat and smoke cigarettes.  Philippe, tease the shark, Philippe.  Philippe has lost a leg.  Privilege is on 23rd and 11th Avenue.  That was unbelievable.  I called Velvet Elvis.  Yeah, I saw that.  That thing shot out like a percent in a cornfield.  That was like giving birth in the old days. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, my God.  You squat and the kid comes up.  And Velvet, of course, opening up for Kevin Poppins.  Tonight, a rascal.  Rascal.  You know, when you get instant feedback that just says things like, the toy is still in  there.  Enough said.  You know that people enjoyed the show.  I say we bring Velvet and the brothers to Caroline tonight.  Oh, yeah?  Take Dina Cole with junk out on stage.  Always hang at the A.  Anthony.  No. 
[03:34:00]  What do you got, Anthony?  I see Dustin Wrangler.  What's going on?  Hey, what up?  I want to officially start the bidding for that blue tarp.  Yeah, put that on eBay.  Yeah, what do you want to pay for it, man?  I don't know.  Well, let me see.  We'll start with 100 bucks and go from there.  All right, Eric.  That's a good start.  The money goes to Earl's sex change operation.  Let me ask you a question.  Were they like trying to, with you filming it, is this going to be like the female sequel  to The Revenge of Nigger Charlie or something like that?  The soul of the nigger Charlie, but.  All right.  Hey, thank you, Anthony. 
[03:34:30]  All right, Dan, thank you, Doug.  What are you doing?  It's Fred Williamson starring in the Blue Top Cabaret.  That was so hot.  That was hot.  And Emma's like, well, we got to get Emma on mic.  She's petrified.  Yeah, get Emma real fast because we got to get her off the air.  The sick thing is you can just walk into privilege and go, where's Emma?  Where's Emma?  Emma, come here.  Emma, come on, Mike.  Oh, poor Emma.  Look, she's horrified.  Oh, Emma, how you doing?  She's even whiter than she was before.  Yeah.  That was something, huh?  She's got the contract.  She's so scared. 
[03:35:00]  Now she's see-through.  I'm a natural redhead, you know.  We know that from last time.  She looked like Edward Monks to scream.  It was so funny.  You handed her that big, huge toy, and she goes, okay, terrific.  Yeah, it's like, all right, what do I do with this?  I just wanted to make my mom proud, you know.  I think you're dead.  Are you working tonight?  Yes, I am.  You better be because you're going to make a lot of money tonight.  Yeah, we're going to make sure everyone goes down to Privilege.  That's a privilege on 11th Avenue and 23rd, I believe.  23rd.  Yes.  And you can just walk right in and say- 
[03:35:30]  Did you survive that experience there, Emma?  I did survive, and I think Velvet is a champ.  A champ, huh?  She almost took out an eye when she stood up.  I just called a kid from the Sixth Sense, and he said, I see scared strippers.  Thanks, Rick.  That thing flew out, almost took out an eye.  Oh, my God.  Almost took out an eye.  She went to stand up or turn around, and there was so much oil on that thing.  I swear to God.  Did you see it?  Yeah.  You're almost in the way.  Oh, there's something that's flying out at me. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, my God.  It took a head off.  Good thing we all wore our Kevlar.  That thing went off.  Curtis.  Curtis.  Curtis.  Goodbye, Curtis.  Bye, Curtis.  All right.  I like when guys decapitate themselves on the phone.  They're on hold for a half hour, and it's like, Curtis, you're on.  Oh, bad day.  With that, I think we have to leave.  But, Emma, thanks for being here.  Please go see Emma.  And Emma, by the way, last time she was here, she was, we, I said, when we were, before  the three gals, you can't talk either.  No, I'm just trying to, well, it's hard when you see the placenta rolling up. 
[03:36:30]  It looks like one of those videos you see in health class.  It does.  It is, right.  Oh, really, yeah.  It sounded like it.  I know, because you know, when you're like 13 or 12 in health class, you don't know anything  about, like, placenta or anything.  So you see the baby come out, and all of a sudden you're like, oh, that's the baby.  And then, you're like, what the hell is the lima bean?  I'll tell you one thing, it would be like throwing a crowbar down an empty hallway.  Emma's going to be able to retire after tonight.  Guys, you're going to be getting dances from you. 
[03:37:00]  Tell me you're D40.  There you go.  All right, listen, we've got to give away the filter.  Oh, no, we're giving away more Warped Tour tickets?  Cool.  All right.  Winner receives a pair of tickets to the Warped Tour 2000 featuring Green Day, the Mighty,  Mighty Bostones, and the Long Beach Dub All-Stars at Randall's Island, Saturday, July 15th.  Tickets are on sale now through Ticketmaster.  We'll give these to the 10th caller, so clear the phones before you get a winner.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7-1, Anthony.  I can't even read that one.  Emma, get your corn tickets now.  You want my corn tickets?  Or are you working tomorrow night? 
[03:37:30]  I am working.  I think you're going to make enough tonight to be able to retire.  I got corn tickets.  Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma.  Privilege, Emma.  I've talked to Belle that she's going to donate her G-string covered in oil for our auction  later on.  I don't know why.  No, everybody's speaking.  Oh, no.  And it wasn't because it was like, well, it was ironic to a point, but then it just got,  I don't know what it got.  It just, wow.  Surreal.  It got surreal, yeah.  It got surreal.  Definitely surreal. 
[03:38:00]  Have you ever had a girl-girl experience?  Yes, I have.  But not with toys and not with an asset.  Yeah, with toys, but not with lots of people watching and on a oily top.  You never have Thanksgiving at home?  Opie, this just coming in over the newswire.  NASA ships are being sent out.  The toy just splashed down somewhere in the South Pacific.  They're going to pick it up.  And they're blaming Gus Grissom for letting it sit.  Gus Grissom.  You screwed the pooch, Gus.  Virgil Gus Grissom. 
[03:38:30]  You blew the hatch.  That poor guy.  All right, we don't want to leave.  We don't want to leave, but we have to step aside for Don and Mike.  All right, Matt.  Jay, thanks for giving us another week of great radio.  Hey, Don and Mike, I like.  I like those guys.  Yeah, they're funny.  A lot better than like us.  Come on!  Hey, that was a true story, that he actually tried to buy his dessert at the place, me and  Jim Rome, and we said, tell him, you know, we're watching, I figure we want to be skinny  like Opie and Anthony.  That was great.  When we were in L.A., I had to drive around in the rent-to-car.  We're in the car listening to commercials.  And listen to me this Friday for Flash Fridays. 
[03:39:00]  We're going to have a Flash Friday party.  Total rip-off of our Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Oh, I saw WOW.  I was watching the Met game.  There was a WOW right by my home plate.  And the OK Terrific sign.  You see that?  OK Terrific.  I didn't see that one, but I saw WOW.  All right, Rick's got the velvet panties.  Wow.  Oh, God, Emma, you are so hot.  That was like the slingshot.  Oh, there you go.  If I ever get a divorce, I'm not even going to ask you to marry me.  I'm just going to show up with a house.  I'll be like, come on outside.  It's a wide load. 
[03:39:30]  How old are you, Emma?  I'm 27.  Oh, God.  She's smart.  College.  Everything.  She's everything you need in a woman.  The perfect breasts.  Ask the brother if he likes her.  Yeah, brother.  Well, baby, what's up?  I mean, not bad for a white girl, right?  Well, a white girl's not bad.  Not bad at all.  I'll take that.  Thank you.  I said no more for my coffee.  It's cool.  Is that white ass a little too small for you, though, yo?  No, it's tight.  It's cool.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you.  I think if you had sex with her, it would actually be assault.  I think you'd kill her. 
[03:40:00]  No, no.  The actual sexual act might be just a little crazy.  You look like a man that is...  Uh-oh.  Everyone already thinks I'm gay, so I don't want to like...  Oh, God.  Hey!  Here it comes.  Go ahead.  We'll end with this line.  Go ahead.  No, we're not.  We're having Kevin Polligan at Rascals, Mike D. Nicola at Caroline's, and O.B. and Anthony's,  the best goddamn radio ever.  Let's go to Caroline's.  Yeah, aside from C-100, Jay Pant, Jay Pimp Hand. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, and for all the listeners, let's stop the death threats on Paul and Billy.  They're calling their cell phones and saying, I'm right behind you.  I'm going to kill you.  Oh, my God.  That's not cool.  Those guys have suffered enough.  We're going to bring them back in.  All right, listen.  On your show.  Yeah.  Sure.  Let's go support Mike D. Nicola.  Yes.  8 and 10, 30, Rascals.  Mario Cantone's the headliner.  All right, cool.  And with that, we'll see you guys Monday at 2.  Thanks.  Have yourself a great weekend.  All right.  God bless Opie and Anthony. 
[03:41:00]  Velvet, real fast, that website.  One last time.  The website is 69menow.net, and you can catch me not the following Thursday, but the Thursday  after I'll be at the waterfront in Yonkers.  Yonkers.  Yonkers.  When you open your sports page and you see the hot sister in the lower left-hand corner,  that's velvet.  All right, yeah.  God, let me just see the ass one more time, Bob.  Just because I'm going to go home right now and take a quote-unquote nap.  Oh, God.  Look at that ass.  Jesus criminy. 
[03:41:30]  All right.  Later.  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, Mom.  Don't bang Opie.  You f*** my mom.  I'll f*** yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  It's a hell of a toboggan ride.  Opie and Anthony, a couple of real motherfuckers.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
